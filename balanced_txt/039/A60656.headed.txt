TO THE READER. READER, IN the first part of this Book thou mayest behold the Uni∣versal Love of God, with the Work of his Power, and thou mayest also behold how man comes to be regenerated, and washed, by the Everlasting Truth, and what the state of man is in the Truth, and what the state of man is out of the Truth; and thou mayest see how Life is attained through Death, and how Rest and Peace in Christ Jesus comes to be possessed. In the middle part thou mayest behold a Testi∣mony unto the Truth, and Enmity and Deceit in opposition to the Truth. In the latter part thou mayest behold divers Cases stated, by which thou mayest perceive something of the Law, and the practice in it, and how deeply innocent people suffer for want of Right: And these things thou reading over, and diligently observing, it may overcome thee, to chuse the better part; and in so doing, thou wilt be kept out of all crooked and perverse wayes, and not run with those that are wicked, nor joyn hands with cruel men. And as for the middle part of this Book coming to view, it is through a ne∣cessity upon me to do good, and that Warning may be taken by all who in such cases are concerned: for I do not publish that part, because I would lay open the faults of any, neither to boast or glory over the weakness of any; for I have re∣ceived the Love of God, and with that I can cover a multi∣tude
of Offences; though in the same Love a Necessity is upon me, to make such Practices manifest, that whosoever is found in them, may speedily repent and turn from them; and that such as are yet free from them, may be preserved out of them, that so all may come to finde mercy with the Lord. And now let thy mind be to the Good in thy self, and with the Light of Christ Jesus reade this Book thorow, and learn of the meek Spirit of God, for in that there is no envie; so will it teach thee Truth, and lead thee into all Truth, where thou wilt feel the Everlasting Springs, and the pure Streams of clensing; and as thou waitest in the Spirit, thou wilt feel the Effects of it to be Love, and the Virtue of its nature, Gentleness and Peace; and if thou mindst it, to obey it, thou mayest do well, in which my labour will be answered, who desires the well-being of all men. W. S.
THE Standing Truth, &c. LOve is of God, and by the Light of Christ Jesus, the Love of God is shed abroad in the hearts of all that believe; for the Light is a manifestation that beam∣eth forth from the Love, and in the Light the Love is tendered, it is an universal Principle, that in its own purity discovereth the world in mans heart; for the uiniversality of its manifestation is not inclosed within the compass of any bounds, but unto all men it giveth light, and makes manifest with its light, what is present in every man; and in this manifestation the darkness cannot limit it, for it is manifest in the universal love of God, to give light to all that are in darkness, that all in it might believe, and come to everlasting Life. Now here is the love of God first to man, which love being received, as in the Light it is manifested, then man comes to be drawn with the love of God, to love God again, and this is perfect love, with which love the sinner is sought, and for sin reproved, where∣in the Lord God doth make known his own compassion to a sin∣ner, and doth manifest, That he would not the death of a sinner, but hath given his onely begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting Life. And with this light of Christ Jesus, is every man enlightened that cometh into the world, and by it, there is an universal manifestation of the love of God; and though the Lord God doth thus manifest his love unto man, and hath given to every man a measure of the Light of Christ, with which he is enlightened, and with which he sees his sin, yet man not obeying the Testimony of it, he abideth still in darkness, and so he errs from the way of Truth and Life,
and is a wanderer in desart places, and takes up his abode in the dark corners of the earth, and there sits estranged from God, and alienated from his Life, and there man suffers bondage and affliction in himself, his pain and his sorrow is daily upon him, and his anguish and his grief is continually about him; for no man can have true peace in his own house untill he come to the Light of Christ, with which he is enlightened; and after he is turned unto the Light, and come into obedience, then he hath a war to make, and a great battel to fight, before he can come to feel his peace setled and sealed; for with the Light, the bo∣dy of sin, and the body of death is discovered, and then mn comes to see how many enemies doth compass him about, and how by them he is separated from God, then he comes to see what he must war against, and what armour he must put on to stand in the battel, and what weapon he must take to make way thorow his enemies; and by believing in the Light and following the Light, he receives strength against his foes, and having re∣ceived the Light, he hath received the Love of God, and then he stands clad with the whole armour of God, and takes the sword of God, with which he smiteth to the heart of his ene∣mies, and wounds them to death, so sees his enemies fall before him, and when they are fallen he casts them out, and cleanseth his house, and then Christ Jesus takes the possession, and he brings everlasting peace in with him; and this is a wise man, whose eye looks to his own house, and takes care of his own family; such a man loves peace at home, and delights to see his family in order, and he is a Christian and not an Infidel; for all Infidels are unfaithful to the Light, and so neglect their own houses, and take no care for their own family, and their house is out of order, and their family is not provided for, and there is no peace in that house; for, when man's eye opens in∣to the world, he lets his enemies into his house, and they sit and rejoyce over him; there the lust of the Eye goeth forth, and the pride of Life exalteth and ruleth, and in that part, all envy, and malice, and evil-will is begotten and nourished, and there the seed of the evil-doet hath his authority, and from his pow∣er proceeds all unrighteousness, all the bad thoughts, words, and deeds; it is the very Womb of cruelty, and the Breast that
nourisheth the persecuting Birth; and whilest this is enter∣tained, that peace of the house is disturbed, and all the family is out of order, and such a man is worse than an Infidel, who takes not care of his own family, but lets in enemies and enter∣tains them, and so harbours that which disquieteth his family, and destroyes it; and then his own house being filled with ene∣mies, and they sitting in authority over him, he becomes actu∣ally disposed by them, and in their nature he appears against o∣thers, and so envy, and malice, and evil-will, and cruelty, and persecution is brought forth, and from the strength of darkness within, it comes to be executed upon the innocent without, and this is the wicked state, unto which there is no peace; but the righteous rejoyce in God, and in his Love their peace is sealed: Now the Light being loved, the house comes to be cleansed, and all the old rubbish of envy and malice purged out; for the Power comes to have an operation in all that believe, and by its working it kills the lust of the eye, and cuts down the pride of Life, and slayes the perverse Nature in every part, and roots out the man of Sin, and brings down the Throne of Antichrist, and so the Seed of God riseth, and the water of cleansing is felt, and the little leaven is known, that worketh all into a new lump, so that the heart and mind be∣comes clean, and the inward parts are washed, and here Christ is known in his power, and his fan is felt to go in man, and the fire is felt that burns the chaffe, and for this end is Christ made manifest; and thus doth he come to man in the fall, his judge∣ment is with him, yea it goes before him, to cut down the seed of the evil-doer: but they who abide the day of his coming, or who stand before him when he thus appeareth, who love his refining hand, and turn not their back upon him, or who abide the furnace, until the work be perfected by him. Oh his appear∣ance is dreadful whilst the wicked standeth, but his mercy is sweet when the wicked is removed. And thus to be regenera∣ted, is a work beyond man's own reason, and thus to be re∣newed and changed is a state not to be comprehended: and who comes to the putting off their old things, they are ready to re∣ceive new, and so passes from death to life in the translation, and then they are born again of incorruptible Seed, in which
Seed the Gospel is known, and Gospel-Peace possessed; and there is Christ in his power over all, he rules in the family, and all the house is in good order, and plentifully provided for; and he fills that house with his peace, and all the family have ful∣ness of joy in his presence; Here a man is in Christ, and is a Christian, and then he is no more his own, but in the Life he is disposed, and all his fruits appear for God; Love is become his Garment, and Meekness the Girdle of his Loins; and this is the Birth born of God, and to do his will it doth delight; to love enemies is its nature, and it can feed them when they hun∣ger, and give them drink when they thrist; it cannot revile when it is reviled, it cannot seek revenge when it is persecuted, for it is born of Love, and in love is naturally disposed; and this is the man that is after God, who is regenerated by the power of God, and is born of the Seed of God, which Seed is holy, pure, and perfect, which Seed is Christ, the Wisdom and Righteousness of God; and as he is in himself, so he is made the same to all that are born of him; then man with his virtues becomes cloath∣ed, and is holy as he is holy, in which holinesse God is seen, and in this pure holy life of Christ, the pure Religion is known, a Religion undefiled, (mark) Christ undefiled, the Religion un∣defiled, and that Religion that is not so, is none of his, for the pure Religion standeth in him, and all his fresh springs open in it; the heavenly water of Life is felt, and known, and his Streames run and cease not; the Lord God doth open his Fountain, the strength of his love goes forth, the River clean∣seth the Valleys, and the sweetness of its virtue is felt from sea to sea, the strength of it is very great, and the banks with its fulness is ready to break; this Religion flourisheth in the Life, and in the Life it stands firm for ever, and of its heavenly virtue there is no end. And here is the standing Truth, in which Truth Christ is fed upon, and the meat that endures to ever∣lasting life is known; This is the Bread that comes down from hea∣ven, which if a man eat he shall never die; and except man eat of this, he hath no Life in Christ; and in this all changable things have their end, he puts that part down, out of which the many Religions arise; and so they decay and wax old, but he endures the same for ever, and brings in a standing Religion in his own
nature, and in this Religion there is no strife, nor envy, nor persecution, (for that is Cain's mark) but love, and peace, and good will to all men, the love that overcomes Cain's na∣ture, and races out his mark, and proclaims Peace on earth, and Good-will amongst men: Here is Christ manifested in the Fathers Love, and he would not the death of a sinner, this is his mind; and a sinner is conttary to his pure Nature, in which there is no sin. Then they have not the Mind of Christ that will Kill and Persecute about Religion, and Oppress those that are contrary minded; that is the work of Antichrist where ever it is, and such are not redeemed out of the World, but lives in it, and with that part slays the Lamb, and crucifies the holy One, and that is spiritual Sodom and Egypt, where the Just suffers; for man not being redeemed, hath a part standing that doth not regard the Innocency, but rules over it, and there man is wise in his own eyes, and with that part he is lifted up, and under that part doth the Innocent suffer, and that is the part which defiles a man, and tosses his mind with the waves of its sea; for man can never come to true settlement, whilst that part liveth in him, that would be wise in knowledge out of the Life; and whilst man is there seeking to know, and to be satisfied with knowledge, that very part comes over him with a vail, and blinds his mind from that which he is seeking to know; and this part will wrest things according to its own apprehension, and from its own apprehension will draw conclusions, and that doth thicken the vail upon man's heart, but never removes it; and man being thus scituate in his own Wisdom and Reason, and with that part comprehending, he stands at the greatest distance from that through which the things of God are revealed, and his mind is not simple to receive the simple Truth, but in the subtile wisdom of the flesh, and the reason in that part, he is striving to comprehend; and here many seek but find not, ask but receive not, they are amiss in themselves, and would re∣ceive things into that part which God doth never answer; and many lye here unsatisfied, and many also that satisfie themselves with that which they have comprehended, into which their be∣lief is entered, though from God that part was never answered, and so they build their nests on high, and in their wisdom sit puf∣fed
up, and there the fowls of the aire please themselves with notions, with which the just are oppressed. Oh how many en∣tertain their enemy in their house, how do they harbour him, and lodge him, and every way seek to please him, as the most worthy guest; but the best friend may stand and knock, and not a door open to let him in! Oh that people did but consider their present states, how is man filled with that which the ene∣my brings home, and how doth he receive it as the most lovely thing, if the old wisdom doth but hunt, and the old reason bring it home, with what joy is that entertained, and how choicely is that treasured up, and what pride and glory doth man take in such riches, it needs not be answered in words, for he that with the Light of Christ will search his own house, may find it to be so, and receive an answer from the Witness of God in his own Conscience? and therefore it is high time for all people, of all sorts and sects, to awake, for time is swift, and being past, none can make it their own again. Oh search with that of God in you, that which bears the burden of uncleanness, and of all your own righteousness. Oh down into the deeps, where you never yet have been, that you may come to clearness in the bottom, and learn the wonders of the Lord in that place; and if you love the Light, you may see your guests, and how with strangers every room of your house is filled, and how the Son of Peace and Love is excluded and shut out, he is too low for your Wis∣dom, and too mean for your Reason, and when he would come in by his Light, and beget your love unto him, your eye cannot behold any comliness in him, and so you exclude him as not wor∣thy of acceptation; and he being thus rejected, that is holy, and meek, and just, and good, what can your houses be filled withal but passion, and deceit, and envy, and malice, yea rot∣tenness and hypocrisie is lodged in your rooms, and with such guests your houses are filled; and there is an unclean house, and an unclean heart and mind, which God's beesom of judgement must pass thorow, before the Son of Peace come into that house to govern: So in the universal Love of God, here is the Truth laid down, as it is in Jesus, that all who seek after the Lord God, may be informed into the right way, and let them mind well, what here breefly followeth.
The Light comes from God, and shines in darkness, and with the Light darkness is discovered; for the Light is not of darkness, though it shines in darkness; but with its manifesta∣tion it sheweth and reproveth darkness with its deeds, and that is the first Principle of the pure Religion, and the first Step into the way of Peace: for to obey the Light, is to obey Christ the Power of God; and through obedience, when the Light re∣proveth, the Power is felt to take away that which is reproved; and Judgement is executed upon that Nature which hath trans∣gressed; for the Power being minded, it begets man into a self∣denial, and leads him in the daily cross, to all that which it doth reprove in him; and then the Power crucifies that part down which hath disquieted, and troubled man in himself, and through the Power, man comes to his Peace; for the way of the Cross is the way of Peace, and the Cross is the Power of God, and the Power stands in the way which leads unto Life; and self must bow and be humbled unto it, and the Cross must be daily taken up to that part which would save its Life, and there must not be a turning aside to flie the Cross; for that which draweth to do so, is darkness and not Light, and there is a part in man, that is very hardly brought to the Cross; and if it be brought un∣to it, it is a very hard thing to keep it there; the Life is sweet, and would save it self, and so the darkness standeth to wrest a∣side from the Cross, and that which wresteth from the Cross, doth wrest the Scriptures also, unto which it draws the mind, and raises up a defence for its Liberty: here darkness wresteth, and then catcheth and enshareth, and the old Wisdom and Rea∣son doth here betray the Innocency, and such never come clear∣ly thorow, though they may have seen some openings; for the Cross being denied, and the judgement fled, man never comes to be changed, but abides in the old nature, and what he hath seen afar off, he gathers it into the old part, and with that un∣righteous part, he holds the Truth; and that is the part which loveth not the Cross; but to die is the greatest gain: Who have ears to hear, let them hear. When a man can stand still, and eye the Power, and the work of the Power in himself, then he sees from whence his Salvation cometh; and then Christ is known in his Power, and received in his Power, and there is no reason∣ing
against him; which Power is the Cross to every part of the old nature, and humbles it down to the death, and crucifies the world unto man, and man unto the world; and there he loses his own Life, with all his Wealth, and all his old garments are stripped from him, and the willing and running ceaseth in him; and all his own Wisdom and Reason comes into silence; and there he lies before the Power a naked Child, and in that state waits for an entrance into a new Life, which through the Cross is attained; and there is the passing from Death to Life, and Christ Jesus is then known, and Life in him, and so an innocent birth is born of the Seed of God, and man rises in Christ, and becomes an heir of Life and blessing, and then he knowes the Kingdom and the Inheritance, and there he possesses the Peace and the Joy; and then the Seed manifests its perfect beauty, in its own perfect righteousness, and perfect holiness, and the glo∣ry of it spreads abroad; and this is a state which can never be compassed, nor attained, but as in it self it is revealed; for the strongest Reason of man is below it, and the deepest of his Wis∣dom cannot fatham it, nor compass it; neither is there any other way to possesse it, but through death to all that part which would compass it and comprehend it; therefore every man to become a fool, that he may be wise; and if People would but come to such a state, they might behold the son in his beauty, and the glory of his incomprehensible Life and Wisdom, which many are come to witness to his praise for evermore. And all that would be answered with Peace, must come to the simple state; for the subtil searcher createth grief and trouble; and therefore every man and woman to deny themselves, and receive Christ Jesus, in the despised way of the Cross, that he may baptize them into his death, and raise them again in his own Life, and then his Life, and Power, and Wisdom spreads abroad, and his king∣dom over all is set, and there is rest from labour, and sitting down in perfect peace: The Inheritance known in the King∣dom, the Possession known in the Riches of it, then man knows his portion in God, who is the Fountain of everlasting good. I thank the, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent of the world, and hust re∣vealed them unto babes: even so Father, because thy good pleasure is such.
A Narrative of some unjust and cruel Dealings, &c. I Having received the Truth of God, and coming to walk in obedience to it, and to live it, I came to be convinced by it, of the unlawfulness of many things, that in times past I had practised, and observed; and amongst divers other things, I was convinced in my Conscience of the unlawfulness of Tythes▪ and being so convinced, I duely considered them in the ground, because I would not keep back any thing from another, that might be his right: And waiting in that which did convince me of the unlawfulness of them, it was manifested to my under∣standing, that the ground of them under the Gospel, was whol∣ly out of the truth; and besides, if any man had a due in such a part of my estate, as was under the Law, when such a part was due to certain People, and for certain uses, yet I found that the same use was not made of that part now, neither were they such a People that now in divers places did receive them; for under the Law they were paid into the Storehouse, and the Levites had one part, and the Fatherless, and the Stranger, and the Widows they were relieved with another part; so that the Store-house did supply the necessity of many, and there was not an Impro∣priator known in that day; to have his own private Barn to ga∣ther his Tythes into, and dispose of them to his own private use. But besides this great disproportion, betwixt Tythes under the Law, and the use of them then, and Tythes at this day, and the use of them now; I also was convinced; that Christ Jesus was come to be the end of the Law, and the end of that Priesthood; and the Priesthood being changed, there is of necessity a change of the Law; and that by Christ Jesus, Life and Immortality was brought to light through the Gospel; and that a free dispensation was now to be enjoyed, and lived in: And still waiting to understand these things perfectly, I came to know my own freedom, by the power of Truth, in my own heart, and the Truth set me free from that state where I had been in bondage, and so I was ga∣thered by the Light of Christ Jesus manifest in my Conscience,
into the love of God, where he opened his Fountain, and I tasted the freeness of his grace, and of his Mercy; and in this dispensation, the Son of God was revealed in me, and then I knew the Law, to be fulfilled by him, and all the Types and Fi∣gures, and Shadows, and variable Things to pass away, and come to their end; then was my Understanding perfectly informed, concerning the particular case of Tythes, and I was clear in my Understanding, that no Commandment stood in force for the continuing of them; but by Christ Jesus, the Law and the Commandment, was fulfilled, and that no man had any right, either to give or sell to another any part of that increase which the Lord increased unto me; and was truly the fruit of my own labour and charge: And upon this ground, I could not for Conscience-sake towards God, observe that Practise or Custom of Tythes any longer, though before I had done it with great dili∣gence, yet now I could not set out any part of that to another, which I was satisfied was my own; but I did mind to gather my corn, as it came into order, without taking notice of any man. And William Pocklington of North Collingham, was at that time the Farmer by Lease, from the Impropriator, of that part called Tythes, within that place where I had corn growing; but this is to be noted, how that he had assigned the interest of his Lease, unto Anthony Pocklington his Brother, as the said Anthony told me himself, and as there was sufficient cause to believe it; for the said Anthony was in Possession, and did gather the Tythes for his own use; by which it did evidently appear, that the pre∣sent Possession, after the manner of the Law, did lye in Antho∣ny and not in William: Yet notwithstanding the said William caused a Sheriffs Warrant to be brought against me, and sued me in his own Name: and one John Taylor came into my dwelling house, and did arrest my Body at William Pocklington's suit, and I desired to see the Warrant, and he shewed it unto me, and I found the day of appearance to be past, according to the War∣rant; and when I told the said Taylor of it, he left me and went his way: then the said William, procured another Sheriffes Warrant against me, and one John White came to my house and did arrest my Body, and he gave me time untill the next morn∣ing, to come to his house at Newark, and when I came there, I
found William Pocklington, who would have been drawing of me to Composition, and said he would put it to me, if I would but give him any thing; but I could not consent to give him any thing upon that account, whereupon he caused me to be sent to Nottingham Prison, and it being mentioned in the Warrant that the Goaler was to keep me safe, so as the Sheriff might have my Body, in one of the Courts at Westminster, such a day before Oli∣ver Cromwels Judges, to answer the said William in a Plea of Trespass: I was desirous to have gone, and given him an an∣swer, but without an Attorney nothing would be accepted, though there is not any Law to compel a man to use an Attor∣ney in such a case, but in his own Person he is to appear; which thing I was very willing to have done, but I was kept close Pri∣soner, until the day of appearance, and also at the day, and after the day, and was not suffered to have any liberty at all, but was kept among the Felons in the Dungeon, and so continued a Prisoner about twenty one weeks, and then I was sent for to London by a Warrant from a Committee of Parliament, and I appeared before them, by whom my liberty at that time was ob∣tained, and I was set free from my Imprisonment. And a little time after I had much weakness upon my Body, and I was so weak that I had not been forth of my Bed for about three weeks, neither could I stand upon my Feet; and in that very time, and in that exercise, the said William Pocklington procured another Sheriffs Warrant against me, and one John Musson came to my house, and by making a lye, he got into the room where I lodged, and did arrest my Body in bed, at William Pocklington's suit, and presently after him came John Taylor, and he asked me what I would do? I told them, they had my Body, they might to what they were permitted; unto which Taylor replyed, that Mr. Pock∣lington saith, If you cannot ride, he will hire a Cart to carry you to Nottingham: So I was willing to give them Bond to ap∣pear, desiring to have come at that time to a Trial with him, and for that end I procured two Friends to be bound with me for my appearance: Thomas Elsam of Gerton was one, and Robert Cranil of North Collingham was the other; and after the Bond was sealed and finished, the said Musson did arrest Tho∣mas Elsam in the chamber, at the said William Pocklington's Suit
also; and he not being willing to answer their practice, he hailed him away: and the same day another Friend was ar∣rested, called William Thorpe of Gerton, at William Pocklington's Suit also, and they were both sent to Prison; though such persons as were concerned to take the Tythes in that place, had taken Corn and Hay from them, both in the Meadow and the Fields: but the said William Pocklington released the said Wil∣liam Thorp within a little time, and continued Thomas Elsam many weeks, and then released him also. So, according to my Bond, I went up to London, and was there at the day of Appear∣ance, and did appear in my own person before the Judge, in the same Court as was expressed in the Warrant and in the Bond, and I had an Attorney of the same Court with me, who was an eye-witness of my Appearance; which being done, I gave him order to enter it in the Office, according to their practice, and he told me he did so: but the said William did not proceed any further against me at that time, but caused Robert Carnil, who was one of my Bonds-men, to be arrested at the Suit of the She∣riff, upon forfeiture of the Bond, though the Bond was wholly discharged by my Appearance, as before is mentioned; yet notwithstanding the said Robert Carnil was sent to Nottingham Prison, and there did remain a Prisoner about twelve weeks; about which time I released his body by a Supercedas: then he let all his Suits fall, and caused my Corn to be taken in harvest-time; and those that he imployed, took away my Corn in their own wills, and this they have done for two years last past; yet notwithstanding he hath caused another Warrant to be brought against me, which was served upon me the seventh day of the eighth moneth 1662, I being in the Prison at Nottingham to visit Friends that were in bonds, the Under-Goaler brought me the Warrant, and shewed it me, and said it was at Pocklington's Suit, by which I am now detained a Prisoner; and the said Pocklington meeting the Under-Goaler about two dayes after, he bid him tell his Master, that he should not let me have any li∣berty, (as the Under-Goaler told me) for if he did, he would complain to the Sheriff: by which practice his spirit is made manifest to all reasonable men, and every moderate eye may see that he is not cloathed with Christianity, which is to love
enemies, but hath a Heathens nature, and the mark of the Beast in his forehead; and his envy doth appear to be exceeding great, who cannot appease it in so many years together, but still presses forward to the filling up of his measure, which is very near at hand; and though I have patience in the love of God to bear these things, and have from time to time overcome the evil with good, yet I am free to open, wherein, and in what places I might or may take just advantage according to the Law, so far as I am free to use it, both in relation to himself, and some others by him imployed in that business, whose proceedings have been illegal and unjust, as in these particulars following may be clearly seen. 1. The suing of me in his own name, when the Interest was in another, as before is mentioned, and in that Case being falsly imprisoned by him about twenty one weeks. 2. To sue me again the second time in his own name, when the Interest yet did continue in another, as aforesaid, and cau∣sing me upon that account to go to London, and then never pro∣ceeded further against me. 3. To cause Robert Carnil to be arrested upon forfeiture of the Bond, when I had discharged the Bond by my own Appear∣ance, and by an Attorney had caused my Appearance to be en∣tered according to their practice, and causing the said Robert falsly to be imprisoned about twelve weeks. 4. To sue me again this last time, and having caused my Corn to be taken and spoiled as aforesaid; and there being now Ecclesiastical Courts, in which all Cases of Tythes are to be tryed, according to that Law, and not in any Temporal Court whatsoever, which doth amount to false Imprisonment for so long as I shall continue a Prisoner upon this account. Then concerning others, which have been imployed by him in that very business, who have acted illegally and contrary to Law; As first, John Taylor coming into my dwelling house, and there arresting my body, when the day of Appearance was past according to the Warrant, and so he had no authority nor law∣full power, either to come into my house, or to arrest my body. Then concerning those that have forcibly taken away my
Corn, though I did never oppose them by resisting, yet against them all I bear forth my Testimony in the Truth; and there were four concerned in that matter, namely, Sutton of Besthorp, Daulton of South-Scarle, Richard Light foot of North-Collingham, and Pocklington's own Servant, whose name I know not; and I did let all these men know, as I had opportunity to speak to them, that they did me wrong, and warned them to take heed what they did in that case, and told them I did not give any consent for them to take away my Corn; yet notwithstanding they proceeded so to do from time to time, which doth amount on their part to a forcible taking, though never opposed by re∣sisting; and besides, the Law doth not give any such power to take Tythes, but only binds the party to set them forth, and not to carry them away; therefore these persons aforesaid, are no less than deep transgressors of the Law, and have made them∣selves liable to the Law, as there is freedom to make use of their own weapon: and hereby all sober people may see, how this man's house hath been furnished with envy, and though he hath had so many years to empty it, yet he hath not cleared it, as by his practice is manifest; but I desire his eyes may be opened, and that he may see the end of those things, and come to Repen∣tance before it be too late, for his glass is almost run, and with∣out Repentance his end will be bitterness; and I would have him know, that there is a righteous God that judgeth between him and me this day, and into his hand alone I commit my in∣nocent Cause. Something touching the Ground of Tythes; by which it doth appear, that Tythes are not of right upon any account, in any place, or to any person at this day; neither can any Law be truly grounded from the Scriptures of Truth, either to give them, or to sell them. The Law was given by Moses, and under that Law Tythes ; and they were not to keep them back, for in was a complaint that they robbed God; and they
were to bring their Tythes into the Storehouse, that there might be meat enough, and that the Fatherless, Strangers, and Widows might be relieved, and not want: and here was the first Cove∣nant with its Law, and Priesthood, and Tythes, and Temple, and Sacrifices, and Offerings of divers sorts; and Meats, and Drinks, and divers Washings; all which was but a figure of him that was to come, Christ Jesus: for the Law made nothing per∣fect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; and when through those figures and shadows the better hope was brought in, then was Moses and his Administration fulfilled, with all things that did pertain unto it; and in fulness of time Christ Jesus came, and Grace and Truth came by him; which Grace and Truth is free, and ends the first Covenant, with all its Services and Or∣dinances, and establisheth a new Covenant upon better promi∣ses, in which Covenant Christ Jesus is known to be the High-Priest over the house of God, and there is the Gospel free, without money or without price, and the Grace free which saveth, and not the works of the first Covenant; and it was never the practice of Christ or his Apostles, to take Tythes, or to sue people for them▪ neither is the name of an Impropriator to be found in all the Scriptures, and how these things are come to pass let people consider; for Christ nor his Disciples did never receive Tythes, neither gave any Commandment for any man to take them, or for any man to pay them; then such as now take them, and sue people at Law for them, do not walk either by precept or example from Christ or his Apostles, and there∣fore their practice is altogether unlawful; and out of the Truth, and all Impropriators are wholly excluded throughout the Scrip∣tures; for Tythes under the Law were never appointed to any under that name, therefore they cannot have any just right in them. Object. But some may say, Surely they have the greatest right to Tythes, because they have purchased them; and the Law hath made Tythes to become unto them, as an Estate in Fee Simple? Ans. There not being either precept or president from Christ nor his Apostles, nor no such Institution under the Gospel, it must needs remove this Objection wholly; and that any man can have just power to sell the labour of another, or any increase
that rises from his labour, and to give unto another person an interest in it, as an Estate of Inheritance, this will not stand with the reasonable part of a man: for that which doth arise to one man through the labour of another man, cannot stand for a certain Interest; because it cometh through labour and charge, and not through any thing certain; so that if a man labour not, then the party that doth claim an interest in his Increase, is wholly disseized and dispossessed of that part which he claims as an Inheritance: and the selling and buying of Tythes is come in of late years, compared with the years since the Apostles time; and both the buyer and the seller were under a vail of thick darkness at that time, which the Light of the Lord doth now make manifest; and it is now seen with a clear eye, that such things are come to pass in the Apostacy, and instituted after the Inventions of men, and not after Christ the Wisdom of God; and therefore they are now to be denied, and the Root of them plucked up and destroyed, and not to stand in any place, nor un∣to any man; for Grace and Truth is come by Jesus Christ, in which Grace and Truth the Freedom is known, and Tythes, as now used in England, are an invention of the Pope, and who would know their rise and setting up, must look into Histories for their ground, for in the Gospel-Scriptures there is no ground for them to stand upon; and Verstegen an Antiquary doth relate their very rise in England, and doth declare that Pope Gregory sent over a company of his Priesthood and Officers into the Island of England, who preached their Doctrine, and turned ma∣ny to their Faith; and then the Pope sent them a Letter, to take the free gift of such as they had converted, and to live upon it: which thing they at the first did, as the History relates, and those gifts were all brought into one place, out of which the necessi∣ties of those were supplyed whom it concerned; but after they had spread their Doctrine more generally, and that there was an increase amongst people in their practice, then they began to divide the whole into particulars, and appointed to each man his place of Cure, which he was to take the charge of, and to receive their particular gifts, but not to receive or take of any other but such as were of his Faith, and owned his practice; And here was the first institution of Parishes and Parish Chur∣ches
in England, according to History: and when they were thus setled, and that the gifts would not answer their particular ends, some beginning to cool in their love, and in their zeal, and were not so liberal in giving as sometimes they had been; then the Pope decreed a Law, and by that Law, gave his Priests power to compel the Tenth part of increase from all People generally, which before was but a free gift from some, as may be seen more at large in the History. And here was the first ground of Parish∣es in England, and out of which Parish Churches are sprung, which People now make so much to do about: And here also was the first Law for compelling the payment of Tythes. And after process of time, it came to pass that the Popes power was denied in England, then what had been gained unto Abbies and Monastries, with a great part of predial Tythes was disposed in∣to a general service, by way of Sale, and so became converted into the hands of Lay persons, who were called Impropriators: And here is the ground from whence they rise, and all the right they can claim originally for their Tythes. And now, Whether the Parish Churches, and Tythes, and Worship, which are pra∣ctised in Parish Churches, have a sound root, let all moderate People consider? And whether their ground be sufficient for any man to persecute another, either for not paying Tythes, or for not going to the Parish Church, or for not Conforming to the Worship which there is practised? And how People can stand by these things, and yet profess Christianity? And whe∣ther they do not stand upon a slippery place, let them all con∣sider? But many are come to know the Lord Jesus Christ, and by his power are redeemed out of all Inventions, and Will-wor∣ships, and are made a free People in his Life, and Wisdom, and he over all is exalted, and his Kingdom is set, and standeth firm, in which is Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy for ever. And now the root of this matter being found in a corrupted earth, the fruit of its nature hath its perfect savour; and many have tasted of its bitterness from time to time, until this day; and there hath been since the first Institution, several Laws made, for the continuing of the payment of Tythes in general, yet by all the Laws in that case made, the recovering of Tythes was referred to the Ecclesiastical Courts, and by Ecclesiastical
Judges, and not in any Temporal Court whatsoever, as in divers Statutes for recovering of Tythes may be mentioned. One in particular I shall quote, namely, 3. Edw. 6. Chap. 13. And that it shall not be lawful unto the Parson, Vicar, Proprietor, Owner or other their Farmer, or Deputies, contrary to this Act, to convent or sue such withholder of Tythes, Obventions, or other Duties aforesaid, before any other Judge than Ecclesiastical. By which it doth ap∣pear, how much innocent People are this day wronged in that case, who are sued for Tythes, by original Wirts out of Temporal Courts; and likewise how much they are wronged through the practice that is used in that Law, and how many this day lye in Holes and Prisons, because the Practice of the Law hath been made a snare unto them, so that they could not proceed in their own case, as of right they ought to have done, and this is ma∣nifest in many particulars; a few of which I shal briefly instance. 1. To be arrested by a Sheriffs Warrant, grounded upon an original Writ out of any Temporal Court; and by that Warrant the Sheriffe is to have the Body of a man in the Court at West∣minster such a day as is expressed, there to answer the Party who hath ought to plead against him, and then the Body of that man to be cast into Prison, and there kept, and not brought into the Court by the Sheriffe, according to the Warrant; is a pra∣ctice through which many innocent People suffer this day in a deep manner, and is a practice that stands wholly in deceit, lyes, and hypocrisie. 2. For a man to give Bond for his appearance upon his arrest, and he doth appear accordingly, and in the truth discharges his Bond; yet notwithstanding his appearance will not be accepted to be good in Law, though by the Law it is onely sufficient; and then to proceed against him upon forfeiture of his Bond, when in the Truth, and also according to Law, he hath really dischar∣ged his Bond: this is a deceitful Practice, and through this Pra∣ctice many innocent People have suffered. 3. To be Subpena'd into the Exchequer, and commanded to appear there in a man's own person, and when he doth perso∣nally appear, then not to accept his appearance, to be good in Law, and in that case to proceed against him as an offender, and to cause his Body to be arrested and imprisoned for a contempt,
when he hath truly answered what he was commanded; this is a practice through which many innocent People do suffer. 4. For a man to give his own Answer unto any Bill exhibited against him, and to answer it in the Truth, and to tender his An∣swer to the Court, and that Answer to be refused, as not being sufficient in Law, when it is a man's own Answer, who by the Law is required to answer, and no Law that enjoynes him to answer otherwise; and notwithstanding his Answer truly ten∣dered, yet to be arrested and imprisoned for a contempt, when he hath observed the thing commanded: this is a practice through which many innocent People suffer. 5. To refuse an Answer as insufficient, because a man cannot swear unto it, though in it self it be really true; and then to cause that man to be arrested, and imprisoned for a contempt, when he hath tendred a true Answer: this is a practice through which many innocent People suffer. 6. There being no Law in force, by which any Temporal Court can receive power to proceed in the case of Tythes, it is wholly insufficient on their part, who put such things in practise; through which practice many have and do very deeply suffer. Therefore who are yet in suffering for Tythes, and remain in Prisons upon the account of such proceedings in any Temporal Court, they ought by the Law to be forthwith discharged, and re∣leased; and not only so, but to be repaired for their great suffer∣ings, loss, and damage which they have sustained by such illegal proceedings, and deceitful practices; through which many have suffered to Death, others to the great loss of their outward E∣states, and others to the decay of their bodily Health, by being so long continued in hardships, who are men of ability, and re∣pute in their Country; and Liberty may be justly challenged and demanded touching all that yet do suffer upon the account here mentioned, and also for these Reasons following. 1. Because many who are in Bonds this day, were cast into Prison by Writs original from the Temporal Courts, whose Authority was upheld by Oliver's Power, and now his Power being disanulled, and all that was acted and done by his Power, made void by this present Power, and is now judged ineffectual to all intents and purposes as if it had never been: Then why should not that judgement reach to the
Innocent, and set them free from their sufferings, which originally was occasioned by his Power, and have for many years together conti∣nued Prisoners? I am sure sound Reason, or a tender heart, will judge this demand both lawful and expedient to be granted. 2. This present Power now being in Government, under which Power there are Courts Ecclesiastical appointed; then all that have been Arrested, by Writs original from any Temporal Court, since this present Power Governed, and who do remain in Prisons upon such Arrests, in case of Tythes; their Liberty may be justly challenged and demanded, and it will be but a reasonable thing for such as are now in Power to grant it, and cause it to be done. I do not state these Cases as being versed in points of Law, but as they are opened to me in the Truth, in which Truth is the pure and sound Reason; and that Truth and Reason seeth thorow all things that are unreasonable, and also manifests what is reasonable, that the Truth and sound Reason, in another may answer it, and receive it; and in the Truth man comes to see all uunreasonable things: and let all reasonable People now judge whether it be reasonable on their part, that practise such things as are here mentioned, and through such practices cause In∣nocent People to suffer? and whether it be reasonable that Innocent People should yet suffer and be continued in Pri∣son upon such grounds? And whether such as now do suffer in those cases, can be lawfully detained, being Imprison∣ed upon original Writs in case of Tythes? And though such things were done, when there was not another way left to recover them, and greedy men would not be satisfied with∣out them, though at that time there was such a practice and pro∣ceedings; yet that Power being now judged unlawful, and re∣moved, such things are returned into their old channel again, and are to be tried in Ecclesiastical Courts onely: Not that I hereby justifie the proceedings of any Court in this case, for I have already shewed the ground of this matter to be corrupted; and am now wading amongst the fowl and unclean streames, where I find little delight as to my self, but through a necessity laid upon me, to do good both to Persecutors and Sufferers, I am constrained to travel amongst these things, though I hasten through them, as contraries to my Life. Now these things be∣ing
duely considered, it cannot but reasonably be judged, that we have good cause, who in these cases are concerned, to de∣mand our just Liberty, and do expect it; and if Liberty be de∣nyed unto us upon this reasonable demand, then let such know who are our Oppressors, that we yet in patience do abide, and in patience we do bear a sure Testimony against all evil-doers and unreasonable men. And here it may be seen what bitter streams the Pope's fountain sendeth forth; and not only so, but also how those that are concerned in the practice of the Law, do degene∣rate from reasonable men, and with their unreasonable part do divert the streams from their proper course; though in that chan∣nel they are too bitter for honest men to drink, yet being diver∣ted from that course, they are made much more bitter from such as do practise in them: for if any part of Reason did order the practice in such cases, it would not prove so tedious and burden∣some to those that are concerned to make defence; If a man's own Appearance would be taken for a sufficient Appearance, as it ought to be; or, if a true Answer would be taken for a suffici∣ent Answer, without an Oath, as it ought to be; or, if the Sheriff would have a man's Body to appear according to his Warrant, as he ought to do; this would come something near to Reason in practice, and would not be so grievous to poor men, who desire to fear God and walk in his Truth: but men are shame∣fully degenerated from Truth and Reason, and their very hearts and minds are corrupted, and their wayes are all crooked, and there is no soundness in their goings, so that an houest simple man cannot walk with them, but be defiled and ensnared. And now I shall mention one thing, and that from the Law, for confirmation of what I have here layed down in the particu∣lar case of Tythes, by which it doth fully appear that no Tempo∣ral Court hath any power to proceed against any man in that case; for the Law saith after this manner, (32. Hen. 8. ch. 7.) That some have not letted to substract the lawful and accustomed Tythes of Corn, Hay, Pasturages, and other sorts of Tythes and Ob∣lations, commonly due to the owners, proprietors, and other possessors, &c. Wherefore it is enacted, That all and singular persons of what estate or degree soever, shall fully and truly, and effectually divide, yeeld, or pay, all and singular Tythes and Offerings aforesaid, &c.
and if any do detain any part of the said Tythes or Offerings, then the party either Ecclesiastical or lay person, having cause to demand the said Tythes, and being thereof wronged or grieved, shall and may convent the person or persons, so offending, before the Ordinary, his Commissary, or other competent Minister or lawful Judge of the place where such wrong shall be done, according to the Ecclesiastical Laws, &c. And another branch of the Statute speaketh on this wise, That if any Ecclesiastical or Spiritual profits, which now be, or hereafter shall be made Temporal unto any person or persons; and that if any other person or persons go about to disseize them, or dis∣inherite them, then in that case the party or parties grieved, may have their remedy in the Temporal Courts, as may be seen more at large in the full Statute. So here is a plain distinction made: for whilst any thing remains in the nature of Tythes, and only denyed as Tythes and Offerings, no Temporal Court hath po∣wer to examine or determine in that case, but the Ecclesiasti∣cal Courts onely: but if any man shall call in question the Estate of another in the ground, as it was once counted Spiritu∣al, and now converted into the possession of a lay person, if an Interest in this case be questioned, then have the Temporal Courts power to examine and determine the Interest of such Estate. And there are divers other Statutes which do refer the recovering of Tythes, where they are denyed, to the determi∣nation of Ecclesiastical Courts only, which I shall not at this time, and in this place, take notice of to mention; for that which is already said, may be sufficient to convince a reasonable man or woman, that the ground and rise of them is out of the Truth; and the way to recover them, if denyed, is to be in Ec∣clesiastical Courts only, and not in Temporal Courts, and that from determination of the Law in that case. All which doth make it evidently appear, how much we have been, and are still wronged, who have been a suffering People many years in this case, and through these practices; and the wrong is much more at this time in this case, than in times lately past, because there is now Ecclesiastical Courts set up and appointed, unto which the Law doth only refer for the recovering of Tythes, and some that in those Courts are called in question about Tythes: and therefore the People of God, who are called Quakers, ought to
be set free from their Imprisonments in that case, who have been wronged so long together, and yet are sufferers by Writs, and Warrants, and Subpena's out of Temporal Courts, and through the practice of such Courts: And if any man be henceforth grieved for want of his Tythes, then let us come to answer in such Courts as by the Law is appointed to hear and determine the same; and let us have free liberty to make our just and rea∣sonable Defence on our own behalf, and not to be interrupted in our Defence, for it is a Case that doth relate to our Consci∣ences; and therefore such as are counted Spiritual men, who are appointed to judge in Spiritual matters, ought to hear us to the full in what we have to say in our own Defence, that so our Answer may be taken and considered, touching the matter which by any Bill may be exhibited against us; and then how∣ever it comes to pass concerning us, or what Sentence may pro∣ceed against us, we shall be contented in our places, and shall either actively or passively be subject without resisting, as our Testimony hitherto doth sufficiently evidence for us; only let us have fair dealings, and legal proceedings, as Men and Chri∣stians: for, as Men, we have a perfect understanding, and in truth and soberness we do behave our selves; and, as Christi∣ans, we have patience to endure, and do not seek revenge; and therefore we ought to have fair dealings amongst all men who are concerned with us in any case. There are other corrupted streams, which descend from the unreasonable part of men towards us, and are practised in di∣vers cases concerning us, by which great sufferings are inflicted upon us; and such practices may briefly be reduced into these particular heads. 1. To summon us to appear at Sessions, and when we ap∣pear according to our Summons, and stand at the Bar to make our just Defence to what may be charged against us, then to tender unto us the Oath of Allegiance, and press us with much violence to take it; and though that Oath was instituted touch∣ing another people, as by the title of it may appear, which is for suppressing Popish Recusants; and it was instituted in the sence of that danger which was by such a people intended against the
King and his Government, by the Gunpowder-Plot; and though afterwards it was pressed to the King, that he would grant the extent of it to all his Subjects, and that he gave his consent so to do, yet it may be seen by that Law which did so institute it in that case, and upon the request of that Parliament, that the Intention and mind both of the King and Parliament, was for the finding out of such a people as did adhere to the Popes Su∣premacy; and though it doth extend to all, as to the tender of it, yet it is with certain considerations; as if any Officer of a Town∣ship do complain to a Justice of Peace, that any person or per∣sons above the age of sixteen years, do not duly repair to their Parish Church, or do not duly receive that which is called a Sa∣crament, as in the said Act is more fully expressed, That then in such cases the Justice of Peace hath power to send for such per∣son or persons, so complained of, by his Warrant, and may ten∣der unto them the said Oath, which for refusing, he hath power to proceed against them, as is appointed by the said Act: but still it is to be observed, that it is but to discover such person or persons as privately do adhere to the Popes Supremacy; and therefore it is expressed in the Oath, that they shall renounce the Pope; and Premunire was ordained only against such persons as should purchase Bulls from Rome, as may be seen in the 16th of Rich. 2d. chap. 5. And now to make this the great business in Courts, and at other times against us, who are an innocent People, who deny the Popes Supremacy and all his practices, and to entrap us with it, as with a snare, because we cannot for Conscience towards God take any Oath at all, but live in obe∣dience to Christ's Command, who saith, Swear not at all; and it is the matter contained in the Oath that was chiefly intended in the first institution of it, and now to ensnare us with it upon every occasion, who make conscience of an Oath, and yet an∣swer the matter as full as any people: for our peaceable living under the King's Government, doth evidently demonstrate our obedience to him, whilst many others that fear not an Oath, can swear and yet not answer the matter contained in the Oath; and here we shew forth our obedience to the King, by answering the matter in the Oath; and we also shew forth our true love to God in keeping his Command, for it is Christ's Command that
we do obey in this case; and so it is to us the Conscience of an Oath, and not wholly the matter; and to proceed against us in this case, is very hard measure; and how many of us that have suffered Imprisonment, and spoyling of our goods, and divers other wayes have deeply suffered by it, and through the practice of it, though we are not at all concerned, by the intention of those from whom the Oath had its first institution; and for to fine us, or imprison us in this case, as hath been, and is yet pra∣ctised, is not only unreasonable from the consideration of these grounds here mentioned, but it is also a practice which standeth opposite to the Law it self, as in the 42. Edw. 3d. ch. 3. where it is expressed, That for the good government of the Commons, no man shall be put to answer without presentment before Justices, or matter of Record, or by due Process and Writ original, according to the old Law: and if any thing from henceforth be done to the con∣trary, it shall be void and holden for error, &c. Now by this Law none should be put to answer without Presentment, or matter of Record, or due Process; Therefore to wave a Presentment up∣on which the party stands presented, and for which cause he is summoned there to appear, and doth appear, and then to tender the Oath unto him, and put him strictly to answer whether he will swear or no, it is not legal in Law; for there is no Pre∣sentment, nor matter of Record, nor due Process against him in that case; and to say, Will you take the Oath of Allegiance? or, Will you swear? when a Presentment lies against him in another case, and he stands at the Bar to answer his Charge, and if he do not give a full Answer to that Question as it is demanded, which as a new thing is tendred, and goes beside the matter for which he stands presented, and to fine him, or imprison him, because he doth not give a full Answer, is a Proceeding void in Law, and holden for error; because no man is to be put to an∣swer without Presentment, or matter of Record, or due Process. 2. To be imprisoned, and kept as a Prisoner, and at the As∣sizes or Sessions brought to the Bar as a Prisoner, and then to tender the Oath of Allegiance, when a man stands a Prisoner at the Bar, and expecteth a due Tryal in order to his Releasment, and if he desire to hear his Charge, as a Prisoner, which every Prisoner ought to do, and to call for his Accusers, if any be, who
ought to be there present, and that he stand upon the case of his Imprisonment, and doth not give a full Answer to the Question demanded about the Oath; then to proceed against him as a re∣fuser of the Oath, and to Fine him, or Imprison him, or Dis∣seize him of his Free-hold, or any other Estate: It is a Pro∣ceeding void in Law, and held for Error; for in that case he should not be put to answer. 3. To be Imprisoned for meeting together to worship God, and to be kept in Prison many weeks, and then to be brought into a Court and set to a Bar of Judgement, and there have the Oath tendered, and no charge imposed upon the Prisoner, touching his Imprisonment, but the Oath alone pressed, and his Answer requi∣red, & for not answering fully to the Question demanded, which generally is this, Will you take the Oath of Allegiance? Or, Will you Swear? And so to be Fined, or Imprisoned upon the account of refusing the Oath; or, to have his Lands and Goods seized, in the case of Premunire; this is void in Law, and holden for Er∣ror: For no Presentment, nor matter of Record, or due Pro∣cess in that case, lyes against the Prisoner; and the Law saith, That no man, of what Estate or Condition that he be, shall be put out of Land or Tenement, nor taken, nor Imprisoned, nor Disinherited, nor put to Death, without being brought to answer by due Process of the Law, 28. Edw. 3d. Chap. 3. And again Magna Charta, Chap. 29. No Freeman shall be taken or Imprisoned, or be Dis∣seized of his Free-hold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be Outlawed or Exiled, or any other wayes Destroyed; nor we will not passe upon him, nor condemn him but by Lawful Judgement of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. And in 3. Charles 1. And I assure you, my Maxime is, That the Peoples Liberties strengthens the Kings Pre∣rogative, and that the Kings Prerogative is to defend the Peoples Li∣berties. And again, 3. Charles 1. in the Petition of Right, No Free man to be Imprisoned without cause shewed. And how contrary to these things have men acted against us, who are cal∣led Quakers? and how have they made their Wills their Law, and in their Wills have Imprisoned us, without any cause at all shewed, and have restrained us of our Liberty, though Free men of England, contrary to Magna Charta, and divers Statutes which have been made for the preservation of the Free-born People of
England, of which number we are, and can challenge as much Liberty by our Birth-right, in all just Priviledges, as any Peo∣ple whatsoever? and therefore if the good and sound Law was observed, we should be outwardly the Freest of all People in this Nation, as inwardly we are by Christ Jesus, and should not come within the compass of any Law, as Transgressors; for by the Law it self it is expressed, That the Law of God is the Law of the Land, and that no man of what estate, degree, or condition he be, hath power to dispence with God's Laws; and the Law of God doth not take hold of the righteous, but sinners, and diso∣bedient, of murtherers, and thieves, and evil-doers; and when hath the Law taken hold upon us as such a People? Hath evil∣deeds been found amongst us? or have we ever been brought before a Judgement Seat, and justly charged with any misde∣meanour? And are not we then cleared by the Law of God, which is righteous? and the Law it self saith, That the Law of God is the Law of the Land, and, no man hath power to dispence with the Law of God; as in the 28. Hen. 8. Chap. 7. And if this was practised, then no imprisonment nor restraint, should be by any man exercised towards us, nor no spoiling of our goods and estates would fall upon any of us, but in all things we should be Protected by the Law of the Land, as we are Justified by the Law of God; and then we should meet without any disturb∣ance, and Worship our God in his unlimitted Spirit, and the Law would stand by us in it, and in all that we practise in answer to God we should be Protected; and that which the Lord in∣creaseth unto us, would not be taken from us, and spoiled, nor an Oath upon any account would be tendered to us; For by the Law of God, which is Holy, and Spiritual, and Just, and Good, our Meetings are lawful, the Increase of our Estates is our own, and our Yea, and Nay, is true without an Oath, and all that we practise in Conscience towards God, is by the Law of God justified: And therefore no Law, Statute, or Ordinance, ought to stand against us, seeing that no man hath power to dis∣pence with God's Law. And, is it not the great cry against us, You will not be obedient to the Laws, but are a willful People, and run your selves into danger and sufferings in your own wills, & there∣fore you deserve to be punished. But let all people know, that in
what we practise, we are justified by the Law of God; and if any Law in the Land do condemn us, & inflict punishment upon us for our practise, then it is not what the Law it self saith it is, but from another ground; and we do not run in our own wills to do those things that we practise, but through a necessity in the eter∣nal motion of God's power we are constrained to bear testimo∣ny unto the Truth, as we have received; and I am very sure that in answering the Lord in obedience to what he layes upon us, we have the answer of a good Conscience in it, and peace with God; and his righteous Law justifies us, and the Law of the Land ought not to condemn us, or punish us; and let foolish People learn to be wise and not charge the motion of God's Spirit, to be an unruly Will, lest they be found in the unpardon∣able sin; for we are a People unknown amongst the Sons of men, though our Testimony stands in Innocency to their view, yet our Life is hid from their eyes, and they know us not, be∣cause they know not him. And do not People from their appre∣hension of our transgression of the Law, take occasion against us, and persecute and spoil us, whilst they themselves are the trans∣gressors, and that by their own Law; which saith, The Law of God is the Law of the Land: And the Law of God saith, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self; but he that will Imprison him, and spoil his goods, and persecute him, doth not love him, so is a transgressor; but we are free, and the Law of God doth not charge guilt upon us, nor condemn us in the things we practise; and therefore it must needs be that such as act against us are the transgressors, and whatsoever stands for Law this day, which doth condemn our practice, and punish us for the using of it, the same doth differ from the Law of God, and so degenerates from that Conclusion which the Law it self makes, and in plain words expresseth, That the Law of God is the Law of the Land. And through the miscarriages of men towards us, whose wills have wrested the Law in divers cases, we have through such things deeply suffered; and yet the yoak is continued upon us, and our Innocency is made a prey upon, for we being a quiet People, and disposed in the principle of Love towards all men, and cannot seek revenge upon any, therefore are our afflicti∣ons increased, whether with Law, or without Law, or against
Law, it is not by many much regarded, as in divers cases might be truly instanced, which is at present waved. And seeing that the Law it self doth make such a Conclusion of its own standing, that it is the Law of God, then to examine a little some particulars, and places in it, if in all things it have perfect agreement with the Law of God; for the Law of God is pure, holy, just and good; and as it hath been shewed, that the pra∣ctise in divers cases doth degenerate from the Law of the Land, so it may come to pass that the Law of the Land may degenerate from the Law of God; for the Law of God speaketh on this wise, 1. Thou shalt not bow to any graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing; And whatsoever is set up, and not by the Spirit of the Lord, is graven out of an imagination, and is an Image, and to bow unto that thing is to bow unto a graven Image; and if the Law of the Land do restrain from such a practice, then it standeth right, but if it do allow such things, or rather compel people to pra∣ctise such things, then doth it degenerate from the Law of God. 2. The Law of God saith, Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain; And to Swear by his Name, is to take his Name in vain; and if the Law of the Land do restrain peo∣ple from all manner of Oathes, then it standeth right, but if it do allow such things, or rather in some cases, compel into such things, then doth it degenerate from the Law of God. 3. Christ Jesus the Lawgiver saith, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and thy Neighbour as thy self; and to love God, is to keep his Commandments; and to love a Neighbour, as to love a mans self, is to do him good, and not to harm him; Now if the Law of the Land do encourage such things, then it standeth right, but if it do allow the breaking of God's Commands, and teach men so; or if it do allow one Neighbour to spoil the goods of ano∣ther, or in some cases rather compell such things to be done, then it doth degenerate from the Law of God, and from the Doctrine of Christ Jesus. 4. Christ Jesus the Lawgiver saith, God is a Spirit, and must be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth; Now if the Law of the Land do allow such a worship and protect it, then it standeth right, but if it do prohibit it, or rather compel from it, then it doth degenerate from the Law of God, and from the Doctrine
of Christ Jesus; and in this case, two things are very conside∣rable to be minded, and not to be practised. 1. Not to bind Peoples Consciences into any Practice, or in∣to any Worship which in their own Conscience they are not perswaded into, nor to compel a Conformity unto any Practice or Worship which standeth not in the Spirit and in the Truth; for to use Force and Compelling-Laws in such Cases, is but to force People to bow unto an Image, or to the likeness of a thing which the Law of God doth expresly forbid. 2. Not to prohibite or forbid People for meeting together in any place, or at any time above such a number; for this is to limit God, if it were possible, and to restrain tender Conscien∣ces from their holy Exercise in God's Spirit, and to keep them from the pure Worship, which standeth in the Spirit, and in the Truth only; and to stop them from that practice which the Fa∣ther seeks them to perform; for Christ saith, the Father seeketh such to worship him: and no Law of the Land ought to take place to diminish that Liberty which any People have in the Spirit, nor to prohibit that Worship that is performed to God in the Spirit, though in the practice there may be contrary minds a∣mongst them; for the Spirit of the Lord God is free, and with∣out limitation; and all that are born of the Spirit they are a free-born People, and their Worship stands singly to God in the Spirit and in the Truth; and though there may be a difference in Worships outwardly, and amongst the Worshippers in point of practice, yet none ought by any outward Law, either to com∣pel or prohibit each other, for that is peculiar to God alone; and no man is to stand up in Judgment concerning it, or to bind the Conscience of another by an outward Law, either to observe the one, or to deny the other; for whoever hath out∣ward Power to rule, and would set that Power to judge in mat∣ters of Conscience, Worship and Religion, and from their own Judgment in such cases, make Laws, to compel to one thing, and to restrain from another thing, such Laws do degenerate from the Law of God, and from the Doctrine of Christ Jesus, and from his Life and Wisdom: And therefore these things con∣sidered and weighed, it will be found of great necessity to search well into the Laws; and where any are found to oppose the righ∣teous
Law of God, and yet stand in force in any such case, to repeal them, that so the Law of the Land may be reduced into the truth of its own saying, and stand in Justice, Equity and Mercy, as doth the Law of God; then Persecution would cease about Religion, and there would be a stream of perfect Liberty to all tender Consciences, and no Restraint would be upon any in case of Worship or Religion, otherwayes living peaceably in the Nation; so would hearts and minds of men come into Love, into Peace, and into Settlement and good Order, and it would allay all the heat and heart-burnings amongst men, and cool them and quiet them; and then there would not need Swords and Spears to preserve Order: for People coming to that of God in themselves, and worshipping and serving God in the Spirit and in the Truth, and every one standing in the Spirit's Liberty; then People would settle and be quiet, and love one another, and be at Peace one amongst another, and there would be good Order through the Nation; but this being wanting, and Compelling-Laws ruling, it makes Broils in the Nation, and causeth Distractions amongst People, which would be pre∣vented, if Liberty in matter of Worship and Religion was grant∣ed and tolerated: And what harm would this do to any man? or what prejudice could come to any man by so doing? Surely none at all, but rather happiness both to such as rule, and such as are ruled; and the comfort of it would be found to be very great unto all that truly fear the Lord: And this is the Liberty which the King's Prerogative is to defend, according to the Maxime of Charles the first. But however it hath been, or yet is with us in these cases outwardly, our trust is in the Lord God, and in him we do rejoyce; and we desire that all people were like-minded with us, and were as we are, except our Bonds and Afflictions; for the Presence of the Lord God is with us, and by his Arm we are supported, and through all these things the Truth standeth, and that is the Word of the Lord to all people, Truth standeth: And if any yet think with themselves that with their strength they can prevail against the Truth, then let them try their strength, but let them also mind what will be the end of it; for this I know in the Truth, that whosoever rises against the Truth will toil themselves in vain, and spend their strength
for nought, and in the end will lie down in sorrow; for Truth standeth: And how many have come up, and have appeared in full strength, and have been permitted to have a blow at Truth? but how are they wasted, and how are they passed away and pe∣rished! yet Truth standeth. Therefore all people, fear the living God, and in time be warned, for no weapon formed against the Truth shall prosper; for Truth standeth over all, and Christ Jesus reigneth, his Power, and Glory and Dignity is set on high, and in his Love all Wrath is swallowed up; and here is the begin∣ning known, and here is the ending set; for the Love of God was first, and the Love of God is last, and here is the finishing of the Work, and the closing up in perfect Peace; and with this Love all contrary Beings are comprehended, and in its own Being it remains unchangeable, and it is Truth and no lye; and Truth standeth, Glory to the Most High for ever and ever, Amen. W. S. Here is the Wisdom and Patience of the Saints: Who have ears to hear, let them hear. THE END.
