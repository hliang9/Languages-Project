TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE PARLIAMENT OF THE COMMON-WEALTH of ENGLAND. The humble Petition of the Company of Worsted-Weavers of the City of Norwich, and County of Norfolk. Humbly Sheweth, THat whereas upon the Complaint and Petition of the Company of Worsted-Weavers, and others in the City and County aforesaid, of great abuses done to their Trade by certain Persons, calling themselves a Company of Wooll-Combers; who by their deceits in making false Yarns, have undone many of your Petitioners, and spoiled their Manufacture. That your Honours were pleased, to refer the said Complaint to the hearing of a Committee. That the said Committee, after many hearings of the parties on both sides, did report the same to this Honourable Parliament. That upâˆ£on hearing of the said report, made by the said Committee to this Honourable Parliament, it was Ordered that an Act should be drawn, whereby provision should be made against the irrigularities of the said Combers. That the said Act hath been read and recommitted, and for a long time hath been ready to be produced. That your Petitioners finding a decay of Trade still to encrease, and that many Families, are daily ruined for want of a just regulation, are forced to be thus solicitous with your Honours; and humbly do pray, That your Honours would be pleased, to consider the case of your poor Petitioners; who have waited above thirteen Moneths to their great expences, and grant that the said Act according to your Order, of the thirtieth of July last, may be this day read and determined. And your Petitioners shall ever pray. Signed in the Name, and by the appointment of the Company of Worsted-Weavers in Norwich and Norfolke. Per me
