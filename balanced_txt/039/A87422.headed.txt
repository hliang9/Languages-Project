AN APOLOGY UNTO The honorable and other the ho∣nored and worthy Officers of his Excellencies the Lord Generals Army, by Lieut. Col. John Jubbes. TOUCHING His Proceeding in a Paper (called, Proposals for Peace and Freedom, offered from many worthy Citizens unto Commissary General IRETON, for the Concurrence of the ARMY,) after the prohibition of things of that Nature. Imprimatur, Gilb. Mabbot. Noble Sirs, IF this of mine should appear any way displeasing to one particular person (though I hope the contrary;) truly it hap∣neth thus, When I left the Army, I found that I could not close with any single interest in England, but that I should more earnestly contend for Peace, then might be pleasing to some powerful Persons; did therfore intend to depart the Kingdom, and of 1200 l. arrears, I endeavoured but for 2. or 300 l. at most for my self, and 100 l. amongst some old Soldiers (which at my first engageing, I brought from their trades, and therefore bound in conscience to consider that their great losse) acquit∣ting the rest: but was so far from obtaining it, that although I have highly endeavored ever since for the auditeing of my Ac∣compts, (and satisfying the Auditory with all things in order
thereunto, at the first of their demands; yet since have it cost me more then 150 l. and 12 months attending & cannot obtain a dis∣patch therein, although it would not have required the time of half a day to have compleated them. Gentlemen, when first I engaged in the Parliaments war, I had bin long deeply sensible of the many greevous Incroachments and Usurpations excercised over the People of this Nation: and therefore in Apr. 1643. in conscience and judgement I drew forth my sword for the recovery of my Countries Rights & Freedom; and continued engaged both before and in all the war of the Earl of Manchesters Army, and since with you, in my Lord Generals Army that now is, untill April 1648. in which time (although through many weaknesses) I neither coveted Honour or Ri∣ches, but a happy Peace: and notwithstanding as great opportu∣nities of inriching my self, as I conceive most men have had, yet can I rejoyce in nothing but in my continued Zeale to my Coun∣tries good; as also of my Poverty: But when I certainly discove∣red Resolutions to grounds and foundations of a lasting War, even unto a conquest of one side unto the 3 Nations; and the ea∣siness to mislead and make bitter the purest waters, I thereat laid down my sword; and the sad thing then appearing, pretious Mr Saltmarsh his life, Mr Penell, Mr Dell and others left the Army. But knowing that man is made, reasonable to admire the Creator, and to command his senses to all proper actions of moderation through faith in the like pretious Grace of Christ, for publique preservation thereto. According to this my knowledge in all singleness of Spirit, I greatly laboured to beget a good understanding be∣tween the City and you; And considering your often published great dislike that any single interest should be set up in this Nati∣on: as also, your high detestation of long sitting Parliaments; with observation of what else was conceived you (as well as they) aymed at, for freedom to the People; And not only for the averting of that Woe and destruction by blood and Famine un∣to mankind, which Wars cannot wave, but for the avoiding the barbarous slavery which the Sword doth ever usher in (though under the higest pretences of Liberty (perhaps for ma∣ny years together before surely effected) as also for a firm and lasting Peace: with consideration of the long and chargeable War before our subduing of Jreland, besides our (almost) utter
devastation and ruine thereof: our long contest and wars with Scotland, even for some hundered of years together; the great poverty of them all in those days: as also that since the Union by King James, their Revenue, Trade and Treasure, was increased before these wars, more then sour-fold. And knowing that Scot∣land and this Nation, being both conteined in one Island, and Jreland lying as it doth; that a wound, or the least distemper in one, must needs be a prick in each of the others sides; and al∣though they were throughly sencible of the King and Lords In∣croachments and Usurpations upon their freedom to the great inslaving of them, and wherefore, at the begining of the Parlia∣ment they first opposed their Tirannie (above others,) yet for the Considerations aforesaid, and that nothing is evil but in the abuse, nor that names mattereth but things: That the Heart of man is deceitful above all; and that if a great Steerer in State, of sometimes a pious, Christian, and holy life, shall by de∣grees, through multiplicity of business, be robbed thereof; yet if in reputation, how easie is it for such a Leader by his false light to put out the true candle of sincerity in most of the godly peo∣ple that it shines upon, Aye, and to draw the Stars of most hea∣venly Light unto the earth again, (if poverty, or the least earthly thoughts of honor possess them, when the Earth, Honor and Riches be at his dispose,) Therefore for the avoiding of grounds of War, and to keep the tyes and bonds of approved prosperous national Peace, as also to hinder the setting up of any particular person, that by his interest might make himself still more abso∣lute, whether under the name of Commoner, King, Emperor or Captain-General, and for the obtainment of free and frequent Parliaments, according to the old unamendable Constitution; as for the continuance of some truth amongst us, that all the cords of Love and Government might not be wholly dissolved, did also in the way of God, according to the Gospel of Christ, and Rule of Peace, for maintenance of propriety, and an equal Free∣dom to all men, (and for binding their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with links of iron, (yet of the most noble and plea∣sant nature), as also for the advancement of piety, true vertue, and the abatement of vice, (which they conceived would not be rejected by you,) drew up the substance of this insuing paper, which is conceived to savor of nothing but Equity and Mercy, for the real Conjunction of all interests, so as the greatest restraint
upon the Cavaliers is but a debarment of sitting in the two next Parliaments Voyces in the Elections thereof, and joyning in any publique Petition thereto during that time; yet looking to means of Safety, Maintenance of Goodness, and hinderance of all means of Excess in evil, knowing the moderation of the Ar∣my, and good light therein; as also how greatly God hath honor∣ed you with success, in subduing of an excessive people, there∣fore desired the chief Command to continue in your hands, as well in Ireland as England, as appears in the Paper. And truly, upon such terms as I am ready to maintain, That if you had both Nations at your dispose, maintaining Propriety, you could not have more ways of Honor, Riches, and Greatness, then is there laid down, (and with a greater certainty of holding the same, then by a Conquest,) but where the thing is not truly examined, it cannot be understood, and knowing your former candor and integrity to the Publique Cause of Christ, (Peace & Righteous∣ness.) I went down with the Paper to Colchester, and by a very worthy Member of Honor, with you, caused it to be presented not only to all the General Officers then there, his Excellency excepted, but to Col. Rainsbrough, and the rest of the other Co∣lonels, and many other worthy Officers also, and whose willing and free approbation it then had, & was carryed to Commissiary Gen. Ireton, who was then at Yarmouth, by a very noble Colonel, for his approbation also: But, as I was informed, with him it stuck, and went no further. Then when his Excellency came to St Albanes I shewed it to him, whose worthy acceptance it there received, (as from him not a little inclineable to peace,) with answer, That it should not want his further Consideration; after that I shewed it to Col. Harrison, who advised me to pro∣secute it also; then after to several others of your Members of much quality; and for that it was so greatly desired, and re∣ceived no check, (either from Officer, or any other Independent; or Leveller that ever saw it,) but in its rest with Commissary Gen. Ireton, (as I was informed:) The Citizens did therefore (again, when it was yet more full then before) endeavor for the Com∣missaries approbation; and at the Armies first coming to London presented it to him for his acceptance, and that from him it might be presented to the Armies view for the Concurrence thereof; but he was pleased to cause answer to be returned, that it was then too late: But after the death of the King, when
I expected Righteousness, and immediately beheld as great ini∣quity and injustice as before. And considering that in your Agree∣ment you made no Bar against a kingly Government, & as it hath been often said amongst many of you, as it is true, this Parliament can bind no further then until the next, and that they may then choose a King, and thus finding no bottom; and for that it is not possible, but every Christian, whose nature is stability, will look at a Foundation, and the most certain Rule whereupon to build up Peace and Righteousness, the Fruit of Christ, (before a depen∣dency for favor and honor sake of the will of the most power∣ful person on earth,) was led out in spirit to deliver the Paper (little differing from what it now appears) unto a Gentleman to be viewed by a noble powerful person amongst you, before I took notice of the Parliaments Commands to the contrary; which being ill taken by some, and mis-represented by others: I am now humbly bold for avoyding your prejudice of me, to represent it to your view to judg of the thing, whereby I doubt not but to be excused by you (whom I so greatly honor) as to the honesty thereof; but crave your wavement of my ignorance of the Parliaments Command to the contrary. And Gentlemen, whereas knowing your own houshold is so greatly divided, that one party chargeth the other for Machi∣viliaen Atheists, Jesuites, &c. and they the other party for Machiviliaen Designers by the Law, Prophets and Gospel, so as indeed unless your end (which may be some years of genera∣tions hence, if nothing but the Sword must deside the differences) accomplish not a better thing then as is charged, witnessed and proclaimed to the world, even by your own Members: You may have the fame of Alexander the Tyrant, but never of Christ; and if as is said amongst you, that many of you do through exceeding fear for hindering your Honor, and just advancement, and dis∣pleasure of some persons, do act by the eye and hints, (by ob∣servation of what is most agreeable to the mind of some parti∣cular persons,) more then clearly to what your judgment stands, and conscience leads you; then, if so, considering the supream Au∣thority so lately taken in, and still is compast by your Sword, what are the people now, or hereafter like to be? Upon the se∣rious consideration whereof I do for the Honor of God, the Nation, and your Peace, Honor and Freedom, as also for the a∣voyding of the sad reports which passeth upon some of the most
honorable persons with you, (for the effecting of a bad design by that means, and conceiving the least overbearings in your Councels, as things standeth, may right-wel tend to great nation∣al evils,) I humbly offer this Expedient, (if his Excellency will be pleased to assent,) that a gradual advancement may be approved on amongst you according to succession, and that if any be un∣worthy thereof, that they may be timely questioned and dischar∣ged, according to Reason, and Discipline of War: But that above all, your Votes may be always taken from the least to the highest Questions in all your Councels, by balls and a ballading box for that purpose, which certain will take off those aspertions, and re∣pair your honor, and lay that dissatisfaction amongst you, (which fear or favour cannot do.) Gentlemen, Truly I did not fight for the fame of Alexander, but Christ; and can it be imagined, that if a real spirited Chri∣stian were now in so great power with us, as to be able to say, as this day such a people shall not be the supream Authority of the Nation, but I will draw my sword against him that shall call them so; but the next day, the best face of Authority, and pre∣sently after to own them for the supream Authority, and then to be put out of question; as also afterwards to say, this thing is just, therefore let it not be referred to the supream Authority, but let us (this Councel) have the honor of it. Might not such a one, by casting off sensuality, and walking by the true spirit of Christ, produce a new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein Righ∣teousness dwells, his personal reign. Consider what Leaders of Nations, Imitation and Custom will do, If I had been born a Cannibal, or Indian of any other condition, I had been the same; If a Turk, a Turk; If an Idolatrous Spaniard, a Spaniard: It is true, God is good unto all but in different manners, accord∣ing to the means of Grace. If I had never heard, I had never spoken, nor yet obtained faith in the grace of Christ: And it is possible for Leaders in Nations, even by their walking, to pu∣rifie or poyson as deep as they please. I shall not speak of the grounds and ways for an assurance of distressed recruits for your Army, or how they will be kept poore and servile for any thing, nor of the unmatchable ways (as of Christian humility) to carry on the high thing; as also the insensible means to elevate and steal away the humble hearts of the godly Officers for that purpose. And truly, I witness it of God, there is such a fault amongst
some few of you, as my pen shakes to record the particulars of my Observation (though unto my self;) and certain it is policy of God that when you finde the great Steerers in State to be corrupt, though but a little, to endeavor an accommodation, and to meet with others interests (if) in a firm way; for you can draw none unto you, unless you exceed others in Justice. And it was desired to be shewn, in a Paper entituled A plea for mode∣nation in the Armies Transactions, what the largest hearted Christian of any party would have more layd down for an equal enjoyment of Peace and Freedom unto all, then was layd down in the Citizens paper. And let my boldness pass (until upon sure grounds there be cause of reproof) if I say, that on This and This only resteth our Freedom, viz. That now our Freedom is known, that we have free and frequent Parliaments, and Peace to put it in execution; for perhaps an honest man (as a rare creature) may act honest things five or six moneths for Gods sake, if a dishonest man for popularity sake, or else for fear of his So∣dan Account to the People, as also their present opportunity to rectifie the thing unjustly acted, and question the actor; And thus neither dishonest or honest men can make the least breach in our Freedom; whereas long vacations of Parliaments and long Sessions do both produce necessitated ignorance by the Ar∣bitraryness of the one, and want of opportunity, and means to question usurpations and incroachments of slavery by the other. But where civil Wars are, there can be no firm, but unconstant Actings, according to success, as others can witness, more feel∣ingly, then your selves. It is also considerable that this Agree∣ment should have bin set on foot by one of the late most famous Cities in the world, out of Arms, which in Reason would have gi∣ven grounds of Peace and not of Wars. Gentlemen, I had a pub∣lique Call amongst you, whereby that was done by me, that commands this my publique dealing with you, lest I should count my self a mercinary beast and a murtherer: and the same spirit that did keep me free from mercinary ends then, is still the same unto me, and I hope will ever command my pen to write the truth, though to the loss of Arrears, favor of any, or the greatest advancement, nay life and all: and although I am not a Leveller, but as you see, or am of those Gentlemens Coun∣cels that were lately committed, (nor know I the cause thereof, for that I yet never read their book) yet let me tell you, That
he that is a true Christian doth expect plain dealing with you a∣bove others; and I must witness it on the behalf of God, you have and do give cause of just exception against much of what you have done and said. I shall not question or speak any thing of your imprisoning some of the Members of Parliament, and secluding the rest; but certain it was for much evil, or else I hope it would not have been done; but if so, then to the future nothing but righteousness is expected from you, and if you hold forth good things, and put them not in execution at your time and season promised, here is a breach of truth; and truly he that is not a beast will question the meaning of it: not did it sound pleasingly to my ears to hear an honorable person of the Com∣mittee of State tell me of necessitated thoughts of adjourning the Parliament for some moneths, and then to recruit this Par∣liament with new Members in the room of those now secluded and imprisoned: And again I am informed, that there is a gentle∣man with you, of much greatness, that saith himself is deeply troubled to see the Parliament to act as they do; but why should that Gentleman blame them? Can it be imagined that when first your Army purged the house, that there were more Members left then were conceived assuredly real to the Armies interest; it is true, the deepest Leader in State will ever have one to co-operate with him; so as in case an interest divide, one may speak the language of one, and the other of the other, to save stakes; as also to have some that must bear their blame, if things frame not according to designe. But truly Gentlemen, if I did think (as perhaps there may be some that do, that after death comes nothing but Fame (though not among you); and that I would act wholy for Fame-sake yet would I take the way of Truth, and plain dealing: which certain is able to confound all the Machiavilians in the world; nor would I hold forth such things as I intend not to perform, for that is Machiavils policy to lay down the best things (but when they will not make for his design) at such times, and at such seasons, or in such ways as they shall not be performed: yet he will save his credit by it (oft times even for a long time together:) But my prayer shall ever be that you will alwayes hold fast the true Spirit and Graces of Christ, Iustice, Mercy, Love, Truth, and Humility, and to finish the bond of Peace to your eternall Honor, and everlasting Com∣fort.
Here the paper or Proposals for an Agreement follows. THe sad and heavie distempers of this Nation (in all Christian wise, ministreth high and just occasion unto us not only to com∣miserate our selves, and the bleeding condition of Ireland, but the great distractions of our Brethren of Scotland also: And knowing that a wound in one must be a prick in each of the others sides; and that the rumours and daily expectation of growing Wars with us (through the horrible unsatisfied condition of the many Interests and Parties (occasioned by the long differences) which still encreaseth, is destroying our late famous Trade and Commerce, whereby the Manufacture is greatly abated, and still must more and more abate and decay, unlesse timely prevented, the Nation becometh poor, and many people so poor, as they dai∣ly famish unto death: nor are our Taxes abated, but still like to be increased upon us. But knowing that the nature of God is peace and preservation, through the righteous example of Christ, by our reasonable sacrifice (not by the will of King or Conqueror.) In consideration whereof, and since greater foundations of righ∣teous freedom to a Nation cannot be laid down, then our Ance∣stors have already provided for, as is witnessed in the Coronation Oath, which by the usurped power assumed by the Barons in their Wars, and since also have been obliterated as to the practice thereof: And seeing that new Foundations of Government (as to the firm setling of the Nation) are not easie to be received, especially, if proceeding from the Sword, which giveth grounds of lasting War and contention: We therefore do agree to cast off all our evill yoaks and burthens of slavery put upon us by the Usurpations and Encroachments of our evill Kings and Lords, and for the sa∣tisfaction of all Parties, do through God resolve to maintain and establish our Liberties, for the preservation of all due Propertie and Freedom: which we declare to be whatsoever we the Folk and People of this Nation shall by our Representatives in Parlia∣ment from time to time hereafter make and chuse, as at large is mentioned in the said Oath: And for the annihilating of all the perilous designes of the ambitious and wicked ones. As also for the avoyding of further effusion of blood, and fr the settlement of a firm and lasting Peace, do further agree upon these just things following; which we think meet to be subscribed by all the free∣born
People of the Land above the age of eighteen yeers, on pain for the refusers to be excluded and debarred the protection of the Lawes: And that all the Subscriptions shall be brought in to the present particular Representatives of Parliament, to be returned and recorded there for a grand Law for ever. First, Wee Agree: I. THat the People shall of course chuse themselves a Parlia∣ment once every two years, after the most free and un∣controulable manner, upon pain of high Treason to the disturbers, over-bearer or over-bearers of any person or persons in the Ele∣lections for ever; and to continue by the space of five months, to begin on every first Thursday in every second March; and to begin to sit upon the first Thursday in April then next ensuing after the dissolution of this, at the accustomed place in Westminster, and to continue until the first Thursday in September then next fol∣lowing and no longer. And that this present Parliament shall terminate and end before the first day of June next coming. II. That out of every Parliament there shall be a Committee of State appointed, consisting of 40 of the Members thereof; six whereof to be out of the City of London and Westminster, and the Borough of Southwark, and at the rest to be equally propor∣tioned for the severall other Counties, Cities, and Towns Corpo∣rate of England and Wales, to negotiate in the Intervals of Par∣liament in all things given them in charge by the said Parliament. And that fifteen at least shall be ever present at the passing of any Order issuing thence. III. That the People being at this time very unequally distri∣buted for electing their Representatives, shall be more indiffe∣rently proportioned according to the judgement of this present Parliament; and that not onely every Free-holder, but Coppi∣holder also that is worth forty shillings per annum, and every other person that is worth forty pounds personall estate, shall have voyces in the Elections thereof. IV. That in all Laws made, or to be made, every person shall be bound alike; and that no degree of Lords, Peers of Parliament now or hereafter Assembling, or others, no Tenure, Estate, Char∣ter, or Office whatsoever shall confer any exemption from the or∣dinary
course of Justice and legall proceedings whereunto others are subjected. V. That one hundred and forty Members of Parliament shall be always present at the passing of any Act for a Law whereby the People are to be bound; saving that sixty may make a House for Debates and Resolves in order thereunto. VI. That Charles Stuart Prince of Wales, eldest Son of Charl Stuart late King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, shall be proclaimed and Crowned King in his Fathers stead, and shall have conferred on him all those lawfull Titles formerly acknow∣ledged due unto his said Father, with all other just Rights which from time to time the Parliament shall give, and acknowledge due to the Crown, and shall possesse and have as great an annuall Re∣venue conferred on him (after the first four years, in which the Kingdome Debts may be paid) as one year with another of the Reign of King James, was brought into the Exchequer, except a defalcation for all such expences for things which shall be thought meet to be done by the Parliament, which formerly were done by by the King. VII. That if any King of England shall hereafter challenge to himself a Negative Voice to the determinations of the Repre∣sentative in Parliament, and shall not according to the duty of his Office, consent to, and signe all such Laws as the people by their Representative the Commons of England, from time to time as∣sembling in Parliament (after consultation had with the Lords therein) shall make and chuse, shall be deposed by the same Par∣liament. And that what Subject of the Nation that shall assist or side with him therein, shall upon good proof thereof, not onely from thenceforth be deemed and taken for Enemies to the State, and therefore not only void of the protection of the Laws, but dealt withall as in a case of High Treason. Secondly we also further Agree. I THat all or any person or persons that shall approve or any way allow of any thing which the King or any person by or under Him have done in this late miserable and destructive Warre shall be dealt with as in a Case of high Treason, and that nei∣ther
any such who have assisted the King in person or otherwise, and such who have approved of any thing done against the State in the said warre, shall not sit, or have place in the two first ensuing Parliaments, or voices in the Elections thereof, nor be admitted to joyn in any Generall or Publique Petition before the end thereof. II That if any person or persons whatsoever that shall any way wilfully endeavour to disgrace (by approbrious speeches) any per∣son or persons for assisting the King in his Warre against the Parlia∣ment, shall be bound to the good behaviour with graet suretie for the same, and that no man whatsoever be hereafter questioned for any thing done in reference to the late publique differences, since the Yeare 1641. further then in execution of the judgement of this pre∣sent Parliament. III. That a generall revisement shall be had of all the Lawes and Statutes now in force, and that those tending to the maintenance of Popery, Prelacy, Episcopacy, Superstition, and all Ecclesiasticall Jurisdiction or Governmen; and whatsoever else that will not best stand with the good of the Nation according to this present age, may be repealed; And that all those that shall be continued unto us, may be put in execution, according to the puritie and truth thereof, that the tediousnesse and long delayes formerly exercised therein, as also all undue practice thereof may be wholly taken away, so as that intended chiefest good for the peaceable well-being of the common∣wealth, may not henceforth be exercised to the great disquieting & wasting of the People as formerly, even hitherto it hath done. And that sure provisions be speedily made not onely for the hinderance and avoiding of all Vagabonds and Beggers, but for a consciencious and sufficient Reliefe for all the Poore and indigent People that none may perish with want as also for the extirpation of all drunk∣ennesse and swearing upon such high penalties, and waies of incou∣ragement for the prosecutors thereof, as through, God may wholly take away those evills. IV. That, the excise shall continue but untill the present ingage∣ment thereupon be discharged; And that what monies soever the Parliament shall be necessitated to use may be raised by Subsidies and Taxes, and such other open and knowne waies as may be most visible and apparently equal to the whole Common-wealth. V. That the Irish shall not still be proceeeded against as to exe∣cute Cruelty, for crueltie, but that both they, and those other Offen∣ders
of our Brethren of England that have not compounded, may yet compound and have such fines set upon them, and so to be payed, as that with respect unto their conditions may not ruine and undoe them and their posterities, except the beginners and fo∣menters of this War. VI. That Annually there shall be an equall Taxe in every Parish within the Kingdome of England and Wales, aswell of Lands as Goods, proportionable to that of the accustomed Tythes Impropri∣tions excepted, to be raised, leavied, and payed into the hands of one or more Treasurers in every Countie for that Purpose to be payed & issued forth again to the Teachers in the Word, who shall not meddle with matters of State. And that all Tythes of Impropriations may be bought in at such rates as the Committee of State (as hereafter followeth) or Commissioners from them, appointed for that pur∣pose shall thinke most reasonable and meet. VII. That whereas God the Creator and Father of Spirits, is Omnipotent and unlimited by man, giving to every one a various and different Spirit, of which no man is certainely Master, no not for a minute, therefore shall libertie of Conscience be granted to all godly consciencious walkers, protesting against the State-destroying Tenents, as to the Civill peace and freedome not onely of the Church of Rome, but of Episcopall and all other Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction. whatsoever yet the way of instructing the people is referred to the Parliament. VIII. That all islaving tenures upon Record by Oathes of fe∣alty, Villanage, Homage and fines at will of the Lords may all be bought in at such rates, as shall not exceed twenty yeares purchase to the Lord upon a Contentious Computation of profits made one yeer with another, according to the Raigne of King James. IX. That the common pastures, whether Forrests or others shall be improved, and divided for and towards the benefit of the State, First, For the avoiding that wilfull famine, which otherwise is like to ensue, if not hereby prevented, Secondly, For a provision for the poore.

FINIS.
Gentlemen, AFter the printing of the two first Sheets, I considering that al∣though the reall intent of my spirit in publishing thereof be for no other end, but for your externall and internall greatest ho∣nour, blisse and prosperity; yet in reguard of my boldnesse with you if (perhaps) a bad construction should be put thereon, it might be taken ill, made a stop thereof; but in consideration of the in∣nocency of my heart, and that I intend the lessening of no mans ho∣nor or command but some timely cautions for repairing thereof; And upon consideration that all pious, wisemen will prize and weigh the caution, corrasive and reproof of a reall Friend, be∣fore the Supallitie wickedness and destroying vanity of dissembling flatterers, Especially of me that so innocently and inoffensively left you after five years engagement with very many of you, and that nothing was ever so burdensome unto me as the losse of your most precious socie∣ty; and because my hearts desire is, that it may be with you as in the times of the Gospel, and that you may not be beclouded under one (of Moses vails, & have as little rest as the children of Israel had, and one of their Sab∣baths in stead of a Sabbath of Christ, and a day of Jubile and peace,) am therefore bold to advise unto the work of Moderation, where the Lord is ever at hand. Nor am I ashamed to tell you, that so great was my cause (at the discovery of those grounds of misery unto the Nations, touching the particular whereof I shall be silent) when first I was pressed to enter∣tain thoughts of laying down my Commission, that the Heavens and Earth were shaken in me, and I was forc'd to inquire again what God was; and by my observation of the orderly motion of the glorious Bodies of the Sun, Moon, Earth and Stars, do know, that something put (and keeps) them in order; which infinite Thing is to day and for ever the life motion and being of all things, but all in order; and as this God did, so he doth create all things good and nothing evill; the L'fties and o∣ther
plants live, and differeth in beauty and vertue: Beasts live, and have sense, the nature where of simply seeketh it self; and be¦ing given to excesse, greatly raveneth, and devoureth each other. But Man is endued not onely with life and sense (and therein no better then a beast) but with at high and glorious superlative faculty of Know∣ledge, called Reason; the nature whereof is to admire him that is not onely Life, Sense and Reason, (which are all in their right use admirably good) but incomprehensibly greater, and that creates all things so good, that no man knows the vertue (as sentially it may be spoken) of the least or ba∣sest of things, or can annihilate the least more or hair: nor is there any thing of Reason, but that onely which tends to admiration, with the ef∣fects thereof which naturally flow from thence for a holy and sober use of all things; but above all, for freedom and preservation of man (who only is capable thereof) to admire the Lord of life and glory. As he that admi∣reth much (which every thing our eys see, our ears hear, and we have occasion to), loveth much; nor can any one destroy, or make any improper use of the thing he rightly loves: and all evil is unto the creature onely, and com∣eth by excesse, and the improper use of things, contrary to the wisdom and truth of the Father by agreement among the sons of men, as doth all good by the moderate and proper use of things, (God being infinite, immutable, and changeth not, the change being onely unto man). Wherefore, if I have Reason given me to command my Senses to all proper actions of modera∣tion (which yet is stifled by the leading Beasts (and mystery of iniquity) of the earth, that subjects the high knowledge, discoursive, and glorious communicative facultie of the soul unto the lust of their senses (as all men unto their wils) which then ceaseth to be Reason, and is but Serpents wit) for the preservation of the Creation, it is proper that I imploy it to the same; but above all man, the glory thereof, and would every one know and consider, that whatsoever is of Reason, is above Sense, and seeketh not it self but in each others good, and would do it also, (which every man can as certainly do as number.) This plain thing is that high thing spoken of by Christ, that would produce a new heaven and a new earth, wherein righteousnesse dwels (and for want of which all men are judging, and shall be judged;) and also is it that knowledge which shall cover the Earth, as water doth the Seas, and that which shall produce the personall reigne of Christ: and this onely is his Spirit, the losse of the first Adam made good by the second, and thus by the Fathers goodness was brought unto the true Son. And when hrough Reason, by Faith in the practice of his graces we have subdued the senses unto this frame we are not onely dead with him as to sensuality; but are risen with him (the words are [are risen with him]) to newnesse of life; not onely here but shall by a change unto everlasting. This is that, freedom where with he hath made us free, and such onely are free indeed, and by faith, in whose merits we are saved; the words are [are saved.] This day salvation is come unto thy house, the words are [is come;] and this is the way to faith, when by reading and hearing of the report of the graces of Christ, I examine
the difference between truth and falshood, between love and envie, between contention and peace, as doe I lay an opposite to every other grace, and upon comparing the one with the other, I finde nothing but joy and blessedness in the one, and horror and dissatisfaction in the other, &c. And being in love with the gain of the one, and hating the dammage of the other, I may right well in reason assure my self, to command my senses by reason, to that which will bring moderation, (righteousnesse and peace which is better then to suffer my senses to captivate Reason, & be perplexed in excess; thus have I faith & assurance of overcoming my Senses, & to capti∣vate them unto that sweet frame of spirit in Christ: And when I can ad∣mire God in love, and rejoycing herein, & that I can do as I would be done unto, I am saved, Salvation is come unto my house through Faith: And it was not by his hangîng upon the Crosse onely, for that was but one suffe∣ring of his love amongst millions, to teach us to be valiant in protesting against that beast of Excess, (and destroyers of man (to the hinderance of admiration) with a moderate and holy Contention unto death, and dye with love to righteousness (as Mr. Saltmarsh did, (a blessed change) pro∣testing against the flitting favor and honor of the greatest of men, abhor∣ring to become implicite members of the Serpents-Tayl, to sting the rest of the silly beasts of the mountains unto death. I say again, that God did and doth create all things good, and nothing evil; and because the Scriptures, if rightly understood, tendeth onely unto this, viz. to instruction unto moderation in the proper (sober and holy) use of all things according to the truth of Agreement, by the wisdome of God in man, for the most free, peaceable and blessed well-being of man to admire the Creator, that is, (at this and every season) the life, motion and being of all things) I know them to be true, and Christ saith, to love God above all, our neighbour as our selves, and doe unto all as we would they should doe unto us; on this dependeth the Law and the Prophets; so as here all the wisdom, good counsell and holy matter contained in the Law and the Prophets, are summed up and brought to a little room, and unto a certain end; and it was the infinite goodness of the Father in send∣ing of such a wise and holy Son as Christ, to shew the weakness, unvail and take off the hard servitude of man under the Law, yoke and cloud of Moses and the Prophets, and inlighten the blinde. And as all the slavery in the Christian world hath come by the Sword, and mysterious Cheat of the heads of the Schools (vented in the Pulpits) by combining with the Anti∣christian policies of the ambitious Rulers thereof: For Christ rightly preached, bringeth nothing but externall, as well as internall freedom and peace; and although the holy Epistles of John were questioned by Calvin, yet may they and the Apocrypha also remain worthy of great esteem, (pro∣vided that that, and all the rest be brought to the end aforesaid) as may the Schools and (Publique meeting-places in like manner) with much re∣spect and honor also. And the most precious Christians ought not alwayes to refrain, nor at all to except against them, for this reason. The more publique the Meet∣ings,
the more persons of Excess are there, whose (holy pious) and mode∣rate carriage they then behold, and are convinced thereby, and glorifie God by such their good light: And unless my grounds may be destroyed, this will follow, That whatsoever is most communicatively good for peace and righteousness unto all, is to be imbraced by all; wherefore to Admire God in the graces of Christ, is the highest good; for all such live above the beggerly Elements of the world in pure reason, reigning over and commanding the senses to serve it; and if a number of men wil agree together to have meetings, to the end to build up one another in pure reason, and that some will for a season agree to fit some to stand, and some to kneel, &c. all which Christ did: this mattereth not; but if any by any form, or other meanes, say themselves to be more righteous then others, here is ambition in him to the depravement of others, and through this Excess comes contention, not peace, the end of such meet∣ings, &c. And as a large piece of Evidence containeth a small thing, and that a line or two beares the strength of the matter; so Christ sum'd up the force of the Scriptures in a line or two, nor put he any other yoke upon us, but a precious and sweet yoke and commandement of love, to tye us together in a heavenly peace, and to avoid destruction of one another. And should not I regard what the blessed history of the Scriptures saith of him, if I were not ravisht with the report of his graces, and which heavenly report wholly tendeth to moderation in the proper (and holy) use of all things, whereby I have faith in him through those his merits, (for Faith comes by hearing) of his report) which tends not only to particular salvation, but generall preservation of man to admire the Father in such a Sonne (before his particular workes of wonder:) And least I should be led away with Fancy in stead of true faith, as sometimes I have been, I shall desire to exchange a sheet a week with any true Christian spirited man touching these grounds, which if any can destroy, I hope to rejoice in it, by learning bet∣ter: And as all Ordinances of prayer, preaching, &c. are nothing unto God, but as they make us better by a sweet communion of love, adorn'd with Charity, the Bond of perfection, (observe another deep binding word, The [Bond] of perfection) but otherwise are cloaks of Iniquity, for the members of that mystery, so is he not to be owned for a Christian that dares do or speak any unjust thing premeditately: And as all man's imperfections are perfections in God, (for saith he) Is there any evil in the City and I have not done it?) wherefore every man may properly be called a godly man, but not a godly man in Christ, and all Christians are to be known by be squaring their lives to all proper actions of moderation, (Justice, Mercy, Truth, Love, Patience, Meekness, Freedom and Peace) not seeking his own, but in each others good. I shall give you here part of a Story of a godly man as to knowledge (out of Christ) in whom God was honored by scourging of a people for Idolizing man. Andromachus of Greece aspired, outed, and carried the Empire from A∣lexus through his frequent weeping for the unjust, and cruel yoak of mi∣sery
inflicted upon the people by him, by which means he bereaved the people so far, as he obtained a great and powerfull party; to whom he pre∣tended the most glorious freedom that ever was, and sealed those his pre∣tences, with abundant of tears, and became not onely like minded to the depth of every ones passion to mourn with them that mourned, to be merry with those that were merry, but would ever wear sheeps cloathing, rejected Oratory, and was exceeding plain in words, and of much affabi∣lity, and seemingly the humblest of men, and would ever act in a crowd in the name of those his first begotten party, where he cherish'd the most zea∣lous and faithfull, though of what manner of faith or zeal to God ward soever, so as they would lock up their works in obedience to his commands, well knowing, that men the more blindly zealous for God (by hopes of salvation through faith onely) they be, will also be the more greedy of destruction to others of another Faith, if rendred much opposite to theirs: That zeal employs the whole man, and that a few sober and zealous per∣sons would do more service then many thousands of others: Could thus cry down, and be ready to destroy the most righteous men whatsoever (disobeying him.) And when first he opposed Alexus, he onely seemingly opposed his tyranny, and him as a Tyrant: It then not being born to speak of the taking away of the man, or the name of that Office, but then seasonably he gave occasion to one young party in his powerfull interest that were most earnest against the tyranny of the Empe∣rour, to be jealous of him and his Compeer, as to intentions of over∣much favor towards the Emperour, but then which party grew much more bitter against the Emperor, as the more jealous against Andromachus also; so as at last they would not bear the name of Emperor, but would have a free State; to which Andromachus rejoycingly ingaged with many tears of sincerity to perform: but after Alexus was outed, Andromachus fa∣vouring the Nobility too highly, that party (which increased) began to be more jealous of him, lest his intentions should not be the same that he pretended touching the freedom of the Common-wealth; and not onely by it, but because he had often vented singular expressions, as if he onely were able to kill or make alive, They then began to question his carriage of things. He then also endeavours to deal as hardly by them as formerly by Alexus his party, and to root out and destroy them that above men had been most faithfull to him, first putting them under the most odious cha∣racters to hinder honest men from examining Truth: and when he had gained so much power, that he made such and so many people as he pleased to be a supreme Authority of the Nation, after what way and manner as best pleased him, he then began to carry it so high amongst his first most powerful party, that if any honest man should but look or speak against what∣soever he pleased, they must be set apart as men of ignominy & baseness, as also for destruction. And when he had goten all under his power, both the Command of treasure, dispose of all Offices aswell of power as others, did thereby rob the hearts of those that were conceived unbiaffable from righ∣teousnes)
so far as for the present honor and favour of him (whose words and protestations touching righteousnesses not being able to be resisted) they thereby for zeale towards him forgot parents, children, kinssolke and acquaintance, not foreseeing the extreme vassillage that afterwads was ex∣ercised by him upon those of their own loyns which they saw in great part Arbitrarily inflicted upon others and which might have been as preseden∣tiall to their own posterity, had not a present floating condition berea∣ved them, as also because they felt it not, God opened not their hearts to prevent it, whose powerfull party he alwayes kept as ignorant as he could by transferring their actions to his supreme authority, and keeping of them in awe of it, and it in awe of them, and was zealous to amend many old abuses in State for pretence of Reformation, and yet would lay no foundation for a certaine Government, but seemingly would offer it; by which he was able to bring in whatsoeuer his sensuall desires coveted; through his mysterious policies (especially by easting a zealous prejudice amongst honest men touching Religion, and in which myst he brought in all Arbitrary cruelty, and caused them to be executioners thereof one against another with showting and much joy; he would say to no man thou shalt serve me, but contrive wayes to starve and destroy them that would not; and although he raigned thus for some time as absolute as a∣ny Emperor or Captaine Generall ever did, yet in the end after he had gai∣ned the Pulpits, he took upon him the Title of Emperor also, but for hold∣ing the same was forced to omit committing Injustice by obstructing Iu∣stice but to fall upon such open Injustice and cruelty as no story mentions, nor yet of such a death as after the people inflicted upon him for the same, thus built he up for himselfe a great name of infamy, as that story at large will give you, all which may serve for a good warning to the best of men, above all, beware of prejudice that vaile of the mysterie; Try all things, Trust no man, Hold fast the best, but this is a hard thing to the sensuall man, nor can any doe it but Christians that delight not in fancies and bubbles of the flitting fauour of man, but in a holy inlarged heart of righ∣teousnesse and communicative, happinesse according to the power of God in Christ. Gentlemen, The Citizens did also well consider that the grounds which are layd by war & the Sword, must be maintained by the arme of flesh, & rod of iron not reason; & because the grounds and foundation of all buildings in State wil not fail greatly to ascertaine you of peace & freedom, or war and slavery, which ever by grounds of war (as to slavery) will be so great as any wise Leader will please to have it, by casting the people under the prejudice of his Army; for ingratitude or the like, Therfore the Citizens being desi∣rous to give grounds for a peaceable Government of Christ, laid down your own things to have been proceeded in by a people of peace, out of Armes, conceiving your goodnesse would according to your duty oblige you to de∣fend them; especially considering, as I must say againe, that what they there intended on your behalfe was so great as if you had the only Comand of England and Ireland too (maintaining propriety) you could not have more wayes of Greatnesse, Riches and Honor then is there laid downe,
and by more certainty of holding the same then by a naked Conquest of the Sword: Only as also a sufficient competency of maintenance to the right worthy private souldiers for ever, as in the eight Article it appears; and for a ground to the performance thereof, a great person with you knows I enga∣ged to have brought sixty Gentlemen of the Common-Councell to him that would have satisfied him of the readinesse of the City touching the prosecution thereof, and for that it was grounded upon the old Truth and Law of the Nation would readily have been assented unto; And truly if at the first you might have had a million of soules to have set your agree∣ment on foot (under God) there had been little feare of as sodaine com∣pleating of the same: Gentlemen, my earnest desire is that we may not be deluded to the destruction of our selves & nation by any misterious policies whatsoever, and that we may know where Christ goes, the Devil must vail; nor can a reall Christlike spirited man have any adversaries, especially when he commmeth into place of power to destribute impartiall Justice and judgment, which only is his nature; and that saying (Yea shall be hated of all men for my Name sake) is thus to be understood, First to cleer the matter of impossibility implyed in the word all; I conceive there is not a person that thinkes himselfe a Christian but knowes he hath some friends, but the words being spoken to the Disciples, who at first were to preach the Gospell distinct from one another abroad the world, there was an assurance in reason thàt at the beginning thereof it could not be other∣wise, because they were to preach externall and internall peace and free∣dome amongst a slaved people, that the greatest servitude and ceremo∣ny of the Law was their most pure Religion to salvation, and at the abo∣lishing thereof they could expect no other but destruction, particulary, & it was spoken to them and no other. Therefore unlesse we bring the Scripture to an end, (viz) to admire the Father in his love, in sending such a Son, and patarne of righteousnesse, (moderation in the proper (sacred and holy) use of all things) we must poure torments of hell upon one another through the deceit of the beasts of the earth, through fancies of confusion, and think we shall do God service in it to; whereas our good and evill are both alike unto him that changeth not, the evil is unto us. And there is no such Antichrist, as they that have lain deepest in the sweet and meek spirit and love of Christ, who are able to speake his language to all, and (no question) are as civillized to all excesse, except that only one Honour, on which thousands of destructive evils unto others floateth in the large sea of hypocrisie and dissimulation, for accomplishment thereof. Gentlemen, should I remonstrate my reasons, that caused me (and ought for ever to cause me) so earnestly to contend for peace and freedom, (and truly I hope with an holy contention) I know you would not look upon me with a prejudiciall eye; because I hope you will not suffer your hearts to be stolen away through the favour of any, as the Courtiers did, but will consider your Fathers brethren, kindred and acquaintance, your children and posterity, and the whole Common-wealth; for which you have indured so much wearisome hardship and perils; and certainly as you have pulled up the foundation of Government, I hope you
will not delay any time, nor take any procrastinating Answer (through pre∣tences of a present unseasonableness in doing of it) to the immediate laying of another, nor suffer it to be any longer in a condition to be commanded & governed by a rod of iron, of what weight of misery the commander thereof to the future will be pleased to put upon it, by casting the people under the prejudice of the Army, for ingratitude or other ways of division; The great dread whereof causeth me to offer you a second expedient, which certain if you cannot destroy my grounds of Reason, there is something of Reason worth the imbracing by you. That all the people of the particular Counties, of England and Wales, that have been faithfull to the Parliament, and against whom no just cause of exception appeareth, may have freedom to assemble together and chuse out 50 (to the best of their knowledge) of the most spotless men, as to excess, especially touching ambition and covetousness, (the cause of our miseries) and for avoiding revenge, prejudice, overbearing and byasing to particular interests, and against the generall good:) that are or shall not be Ministers, late or present Members of this Parliament, Lawyers, nor any Lords of Mannors, or other person worth less then 500 pounds at the least, that may draw up an agreement for the grounds foundation, and moddle of Government to the people of this Nation; which may be brought into the Parliament at a certain day, by a Committee of 10 at the fewest, appointed and chosen out of every Respective Committee of the the particular Counties; & out of each of which there may be two appointed to draw up, and extract the major desires of every particular Comprised in every of the Agreements; And that then all people above the age of 18 yeers may be injoyned the subscribing thereof, or otherwise be put with∣out the protection of this Agreement and Lawes issuing thence. And truly Gentlemen, because I know the humility of the most of your hearts, and (though passing by much) cannot but mind you, that you may remember the Fields where your word was, God with us: as also neither you nor this City can forget at what time your Signall was a Laurell, and that it is provided for to the future you will finde them ingraven as sure badgeds of Conquest remembrances. I am your humble servannt in Christ FINIS.
