Title, Interest, and demand what∣soever which he hath or might have, claim, or pretend to have of, in, or to the premises, or any of them, by Ver∣tue of the said Office of Great Admiral of England, or of our Letters Patents, da∣ted at Westminster the eighth day of July in the seven and twentieth year of our Reign, made unto him of the said Office of Great Admiral of England, or of any Sentence or Clause therein con∣tained or otherwise;Prays the Granting there∣of to the Trini∣ty-House. And hath besought us that we will be pleased to Give, Grant and Confirm the premises unto the Master, Wardens, and Assistants, of the Trinity-House of Deptford-Strond in our County of Kent.

our hands, all his Right, Title, Interest, Authority, and demand whatsoever which he hath, or might have, Claim, Challenge, or pretend to have of, in, or to the making, Erecting, Setting up, Placeing or Laying out of all, or any Bea∣cons, Buoyes, Marks, and Signs for the Sea, to be made, Erected, and Set up, Placed, or laid forth, in, or upon the Sea or Sea-Shores, Coasts near the Sea, or Ʋplands, or Forelands, or elsewhere near the Sea, by Vertue or Colour of the said Office of great Admiral of England, Letters Patents aforesaid, or otherwise howsoever. And hath by his said Deed declared and made known,Declares the Right thereof to be in Trinity-House, by Act of Parliament. that albeit by the Letter of our said Letters Patents afore∣said, the said Beaconage, and other the last recited premises are granted unto him, Yet it doth notwithstanding evi∣dently appear unto him, that it is in and by one Statute or Act of Parliament, made in the Eighth Year of Our Reign,
specially and expresly Ordained and En∣acted, that the said Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Trinity-House of the Deptford Strond aforesaid being a Com∣pany incorporated, should and might lawfully by Vertue of the said Act, from time to time, at their Wills and Pleasures, and at their Costs and Char∣ges, make, Erect, and Set up, such, and so many Beacons, Marks, and Signs for the Sea, in such Place, or Places of the Sea-shores, and Ʋplands near the Sea Coasts, or Forelands of the Sea, for Seamarks, as to them shall seem most meet, need∣ful and requisite, whereby dangers may be avoided and escaped, and Ships the better come to their Ports without Peril: But for that the placing, and laying out of Buoyes in convenient Places of the Sea, and Channel, for passing into and out of Havens, and Rivers, being a thing most necessary to forewarn, shun, and pre∣vent the Peril and danger of those pla∣ces may yet be questioned upon, by the strict Letter of the said Statute,Not fully enough express'd in the said Act. or
Act of Parliament, for that the said Buoyes be properly and naturally placed and laid out upon or within the Water of the Sea-Haven or River, and not on the Sea-shore, or Banks dry at any time, and doth therefore justly deserve some explanation.
