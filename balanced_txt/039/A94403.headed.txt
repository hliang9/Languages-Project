TO HIS EXCELLENCY General MONK, THE Congratulation and Address of us the Knights, Divines, Free-Holders, and others of the County of Bucks. Humbly sheweth, THAT with all possible Gratitude we admire the wise and graci∣ous Dispensation of things by Almighty God, who hath moved your self, and other the worthy Officers with you to such just and honourable Resolutions, as to put your selves into the Breach then, when Tyranny, Irreligion, and all Confusion like a mighty Flood were ready to break in upon us. An Occasion in which, whether the Noblensss of the Attempts, or the Happiness of the success were more considerable, after-times will take pleasure to discourse: and we at present congratulate these your sentiments of Honour and Conscience. Sir, Our Credit abroad is inpaired, our Trade at home is decayed, our Fundamental Laws are violated, our primitive Apostolick Religion endangered; The cause of all which we humbly conceive is the force and violence put upon the Parliament in the year 1648. and since to obviate all which evils we request the total re∣moval of that force, and that all surviving Members so secluded, be re∣stored to the discharge of their Trust, Vacancies be supplyed by free Elections according to Law, that no previous Oaths or Engagments be put upon any of them that shall be chosen to sit, and Vote in Parliament. Sir; This is our desire, and as we observe 'tis the voice of the whole people, and that is the voice of God; we doubt not but that you have been reserved for such a time as this: in pursuance of which we are ready to hazard our Lives and Estates.
