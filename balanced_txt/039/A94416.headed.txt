TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE LORD GENERAL MONCK, THE Humble Addresse and Thanks of the Gentry, and other Free-Holders in the COUNTY of HARTFORD. MY LORD, WEE having by your Lordships carefull and speedy Progresse towards a publique Setlement been prevented in joyning our intended Requests with those of other Countyes, thought it our Duty to be more early against the sin of ingratitude to God and your Lordship for those beginings of hope which Divine providence has by your hand sent us; And that with much honour to those secluded Members, who now being by your just hand restored to a capacity of doing righteous things, doe in earnest prepare to give us no factious engaged Assembly, (as of late times) but a Legall free and full Parliament, whom (if God see good) we hope he may have ordained to close up our Breaches, to raise up our Ruines, and to build us as in the Dayes of old; Which that they may be the better able to performe; Our humble re∣quest to your Lordship is, That you would be pleased not by any Qualifications, or other previous Ingagements to put upon them any Necessity, save only of an honest and timely Dissolution, which by woefull experience we find to be necessary: But as for any other Restrictions which under colour of common safety, may be set up for sup∣port of Private Interest, and to weaken the hands of Honest Men, we hope and pray that they may not be exa∣cted against our Native freedome of chusing, and being chosen into the House of Commons; Which if it be not free cannot owne that Name to it selfe, nor give honour to You, or comfort to Us; Your Lordships most humble and most obliged Servants. This Addresse was subscribed at Hartford by many Knights and Gentlemen, who for the Delivery thereof to his Excellency appointed Sir HENRY BLOƲNT, Sir JOHN GORE and Colonell ALBAN COXE: Who did accordingly deliver it the 27 Feb. FINIS. Printed by John Brudenell at his dwelling house in Maiden head-alley near Newgate, 1659.
