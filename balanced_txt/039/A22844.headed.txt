❧To the Iustices of Peace. AS the want of Lawes occasioneth wrongs to be committed wit∣tingly; And want of knowledge of Lawes carieth men into offences ignorantly: So are Lawes thēselues a burthen when they are too many, and their ve∣ry number is a cause that few are executed: where Penall Lawes haue otherwise no life, but in their execution. And certaine∣ly that Magistrate who knowes but few, and causeth those to be
duely obserued, deserueth better of the Common-wealth, then he that knoweth many, and exe∣cutes but few. Therefore is the Composition of this Volume, that those few Lawes, and other Ordinances being most needfull for the time, may bee easily had, soone knowne, and duely execu∣ted; Which is required by his MAIESTIE.

❧By the KING. ¶A Proclamation for quickning the Lawes made for the reliefe of the Poore, and the suppressing, pu∣nishing, and setling of the sturdie Rogues and Vagabonds. WHereas many excel∣lent Lawes and Sta∣tutes with great iudge∣ment and prouidence haue been made in the times of Our late deare and Royall Father▪ and of the late Queene Elizabeth, for the reliefe of the impo∣tent, and indigent Poore, and for the punishing, suppressing, and seting of the sturdy Rogues, and Vaga∣bonds,
which Lawes and Sta∣tutes, if they were duely obserued would be of exceeding great vse for the peace & plenty of this Realme, but the neglect thereof is the occasi∣on of much disorder, and many in∣sufferable abuses. And whereas it is fit at all times, to put in execution those Lawes which are of so neces∣sarie, and so continuall vse: yet the apparant and visible danger of the Pestilence, (vnlesse the same by Gods gracious mercie, and Our prouident endeuours be preuented) doth much more require the same at this present. We haue therefore thought it fit, by the aduice of Our Priuie Coun∣cell, by this Our publike Proclama∣tion, straightly to charge and com∣mand▪ that all our louing Subiects in their seueral places, doe vse all possible ate and diligence as a prin∣cipall meanes to preuent the spread∣ing, and dispersing of that contagi∣ous
sicknesse, to obserue and put in due execution, all the said Lawes made and prouided against Rogues and Vagabonds, and for the reliefe of the truely poore and impotent people. And in the first place, Wee strictly charge and command, that in Our Cities of London, and Westminster, and Suburbs there∣of▪ and places adiacent thereunto, and generally throughout the whole Kingdome, that there bee carefull Watch, and Ward, kept for the apprehending and punishing of al Rogues and Vagabonds, who either in the streets or high wayes, vnder the names of Souldiers, or Mariners, Glasse-men, Pot-men▪ Pedlars, or Petty-Chapmen, or of poore or impotent people, shall bee found either wandring, or begging. And Wee doe further strictly charge and command, that all Con∣stables, Head boroughs, and other Officers, doe vse all diligence, to pu∣nish,
and passe away according to the Law, all such Wanderers, or Beggars, as shall be apprehended▪ either in the Cities, or places afore∣said, or in any other Cities, Towns, Parishes, or places within this Realme, and take great care that none passe vnder the colour of coun∣terfeit Passes. And that all Irish Rogues, and Vagabonds be forth∣with apprehended, wheresoeuer they shall bee found and punished, and sent home according to a former Proclamation heretofore published in that behalfe. That all House∣holders of whose persons, or at Whose Houses, any such Vagrants shall bee taken begging, doe appre∣hend, or cause them to be apprehen∣ded, and caryed to the next Consta∣ble, or other Officer to bee punished, according to the Lawes. And that they forbeare to relieue them, there∣by to giue them incouragement to continue in their wicked course of life.
That the Iustices of Peace in their seuerall places throughout this Kingdome be carefull either by Prouost Marshals, or by the high Constables, or otherwise by their good discretions effectually to pro∣uide, that all Rogues and Vaga∣bonds of all sorts bee searched for, apprehended punished and suppres∣sed according to the Law. And that once euery moneth at the least, a conuenient number of the Iustices of Peace in euery seuerall Counti and Diuision, shall meete together in some conuenient place in that Di∣uision, and take account of the High Constables, petty Constables, and other Officers within that Diuisi∣on, how they haue obserued the Lawes and Our commandement touching the Premisses. And that they seuerely punish all such as shall bee found remisse or negligent in that behalfe. And We doe hereby strictly charge and com∣mand
as well all and singular Iu∣stices of Peace, Constables, Head∣boroughs, and other Our Officers and Ministers, as also all Our lo∣uing Subiects of what estate or de∣gree soeuer to vse all diligence, that all and euery houses or places which are or shall bee visited or infected with the sicknesse, bee carefully shut vp, and Watch and Ward kept ouer them that no person or persons within those places doe goe abroad, or depart from thence, during the time of such Visitation. And We doe hereby command all and singu∣lar our Iudges of Assize in their se∣uerall Circuits to giue speciall charge, and make speciall inquiry of the defaults of all and euery the Iu∣stices of Peace who shall not ob∣serue their meetings in the seuerall Counties and Diuisions aforesaid, or shall not punish such Constables or other Officers as being informed either by their owne view and
knowledge, or otherwise are or shal be found remisse or negligent in the Premisses, or in leauying such pe∣nalties & forfeitures as the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme re∣quire against the parties offending herein. And thereof to informe Vs or Our Priuy Councell, to the end that such due course may be taken either by remouing out of the Com∣mission such negligent Iustices of the Peace, or otherwise by inflicting such punishment vpon them as shal be due to such as neglect their owne duties, and Our Royall command published vpon so important an oc∣casion. And We doe hereby will require and command all and euery Our Iudges of Assize, Maiors, She∣riffes, Iustices of Peace, Consta∣bles, Headboroughs and other Our Officers, Ministers and Subiects whom it may concerne, that they carefully and effectually obserue
and performe all and euery the Pre∣misses, as they will answere the neglect thereof at their vttermost perils. And whereas Wee haue lately commanded a Booke to be printed and published containing certaine Statutes made and enacted hereto∣fore for the reliefe of the Poore, and of Souldiers and Mariners, and for punishment of Rogues and Va∣gabonds, and for the reliefe and or∣dering of persons infected with the Plague, and also containing cer∣taine Orders heretofore, and now lately conceiued and made concern∣ing health: All which are necessarie to be knowen and obserued by Our louing Subiects that thereby they may the better auoid those dangers which otherwise may fall vpon their persons or estates by their neglect thereof. Wee haue thought it fit hereby to giue notice thereof to all Our louing Subiects, to the end
that none may pretend ignorance for an excuse, in matters of so great importance. And Wee doe hereby declare, that whosoeuer shall bee found remisse or negligent in the execution of any part of the Pre∣misses, shall receiue such condigne punishment for their offence, as by the Lawes of this Realme, or by Our Prerogatiue Royall can or may be iustly inflicted vpon them. Giuen at Our Court at Whitehal the three and twentieth day of April, in the sixt yeere of Our Reigne of England, Scot∣land, France and Ireland. God saue the King.

AS the most louing and gracious care of his Maiestie for the preseruation of his People, hath alreadie beene earnestly shewed and declared by such meanes and waies as were thought expedient to suppresse the grieuous Infection of the Plague, and to preuent the encrease thereof, within the Citie of LONDON, and parts about it; so what∣soeuer other good meanes may be yet re∣maining

And after their first generall as∣sembly, they shall make a distribution of themselues to sundry Limits and diuisions, as in other common seruices of the Coun∣tie they are accustomed to doe, for the prose∣cution thereof. 2 First they shall enquire, and presenly informe themselues by all good meanes, what Townes and Villages are at the time of such assembly infected within euery their Counties, and in what Hundred or other Diuision, the sayde Townes and Villages are, and how many of the same places so Infected are Corporate Townes, Market Townes, and Villages, and shall consider of what wealth the Inhabitants of the same townes and Parishes are, to be able to relieue the poore that are or shall be infected, and to be restrained in their houses.
3 Item, thereupon after conference v∣sed according to the necessitie of the cause, they shall deuise and make a generall taxati∣on, either by charging the Towne infected with one summe in grosse, or by charging the speciall persons of wealth within the same, to be forthwith collected for the rate of one moneth at the first, and so if the sicke∣nesse shall continue, the collection of the like summe, or of more or of lesse, as time and cause shall require, and the same to be euery first, second, third, or fourth weeke employ∣ed to and for the execution of the sayde Or∣ders. And in case some of the sayd Townes Infected, shall manifestly appeare not to bee of sufficient abilitie to contribute suf∣ficient for the charges requisite, then the Taxation or Collection shall bee made or further extended to other parts, or in any other further limits, as by them shall bee thought requisite where there shall bee any such Townes or Villages so infected, and vnable to relieue themselues. And if the said Townes be situated in the borders and con∣fines of any other shire, then as the Iustices shall see cause and neede for the greatnesse of the charge requisite, that the parts of the shire ioyning to the Townes infected be not able, they shall write their letters to the next Iustices of the other Shire so confining, to procure by collection some reliefe, as in like cases they are to relieue them, in respect of
neere neighbourhood of the place, and for that the same Infection may bee the better stayed from the said adioyning places, thogh they be separated by name of the Countie. 4 Item, they shall cause to be appointed in euery Parish aswell infected as not infec∣ted, certaine persons to view the bodies of all such as shall die, before they be suffered to be buried, and to certifie the Minister of the Church and Churchwarden, or other prin∣cipall officers, or their substitutes of what probable disease the said persons died: and the said viewers, to haue weekely some al∣lowance, & the more large allowance where the Townes or Parishes bee infected, du∣ring the Infection, towards their mainte∣nance, to the end they which shalbe in places infected, may forbeare to resort into the com∣pany of others that are sound: and those per∣sons to be sworne to make true report accor∣ding to their knowledge, and the choise of them to be made by direction of the Curate of the Church, with three or foure substan∣tiall men of the Parish. And in case the said viewers either through fauour or cor∣ruption, shall giue wrong certificate, or shall refuse to serue being thereunto appointed, then to cause them to be punished by impri∣sonment, in such sort as may serue for a ter∣rour to others.
5 Item, the houses of such persons out of the which there shal die any of the plague, being so certified by the viewers, or other∣wise knowen, or where it shalbe vnderstood, that any person remaineth sicke of ye plague, to be closed vp on all parts during the time of restraint, viz. sixe weekes, after the sicknes be ceased in the same house, in case the said houses so infected shall be within any Town hauing houses neere adioyning to the same. And if the infection happen in houses disper∣sed in Villages, and separated from other houses, and that of necessitie, for the seruing of their cattell, & manuring of their ground, the said persons cannot continue in their houses, then they be neuerthelesse restrained from resorting ino company of others, ei∣ther publikely or priuately during the sayd time of restraint, and to weare some marke in their vppermost garments, or beare white rods in their handes at such time as they shall goe abroad, if there bee any doubt that the masters and owners of the houses infected, will not duely obserue the directi∣ons of shutting vp the doores, specially in the night, then shall there be appointed two or three watchmen by turnes, which shall be sworne to attend & watch the house, and to apprehend any person that shall come out of the house contrary to the order, and the same persons by order of the Iustices, shall be a competent time imprisoned in the stockes in
the high way next to the house infected: and furthermore, some speciall marke shall bee made and fixed to the doores of euery of the infected houses, and where any such houses shalbe Innes or Alehouses, the Signes shal be taken downe for the time of the restraint, and some crosse or other marke set vpon the place thereof to be a token of the sickenesse. 6 Item, they shall haue good regard to chuse honest persons, that either shall collect the summes assessed, or shall haue the custo∣die thereof, and out of the sayd collection to allot a weekely proportion for the finding of victuall, or fire, or medicines for the poorer sort, during the time of their restraint. And whereas sme persons being well disposed to yeeld almes and reliefe, will be more wil∣ling to giue some portions of victuall, as corne, bread, or other meate, the same shalbe committed to the charge of some speciall per∣sons, that will honestly and truely preserue the same, to be distributed as they shal be ap∣pointed for the poore that are infected. 7 Item, to appoint certaine persons dwelling within the Townes infected, to prouide and deliuer all necessaries of victu∣als, or any matter of watching or other at∣tendance, to keepe such as are of good wealth being restrained, at their owne proper costs and charges, and the poore at the common
charges: and the said persons so appointed to be ordered, not to resort to any publike as∣sembly during the time of such their atten∣dance, as also to weare some marke on their vpper garment, or to beare a white rodde in their hand, to the ende others may auoid their company. 8 Item, that in the Shire towne in e∣uery Countie, and in other great Townes meete for that purpose, there may be proui∣sion bespoken and made, of such Preserua∣tiues and other remedies, which otherwise in meaner townes cannot be readily had, as by the Physicians shalbe prescribed, and is at this present reduced into an Aduise made by the Physicians, and now Printed and sent with the said Orders, which may be fixed in Market places, vpon places vsuall for such publique matters, and in other Townes in the bodies of the Parish Chur∣ches, and Chappels: in which Aduise onely such things are prescribed, as vsually are to be had and found in all Countreys without great charge or cost. 9 Item, the Ministers and Curats, and the Churchwardens in euery Parish, shal in writing certifie weekely to some of the Iu∣stices, residing within the Hundred or other limit where they serue, the number of such persons as are infected and doe not die, and
also of all such as shall die within their Pa∣rishes, and their diseases probable whereof they died, and the same to be certified to the rest of the Iustices at their assemblies, which during some conuenient time would be eue∣ry one and twentie dayes, and thereof a par∣ticular booke kept by the Clerke of the Peace or some such like. 10 Item, to appoint some place apart in each Parish for the buriall of such persons as shall die of the Plague, as also to giue or∣der that they be buried after Sunne setting, and yet neuerthelesse by day light, so as the Curate be present for the obseruation of the Rites and Ceremonies prescribed by the Law, foreseeing as much as conueniently he may, to be distant from the danger of in∣fection of the person dead, or of the company that shall bring the corpse to the graue. 11 Item, the Iustices of the whole Coun∣tie to assemble once in one and twentie dayes, to examine whether those Orders be duely executed, and to certifie to the Lords of the Priuie Counsell their proceedings in that behalfe, what Townes and Villages be infected, as also the numbers of the dead, and the diseases whereof they died, and what summes of money are taxed and col∣lected to this purpose, and how the same are distributed.
12 Item, the Iustices of the Hundred, where any such Infection is, or the Iusti∣ces next adioyning thereunto, to assemble once a weeke, to take accompt of the execu∣tion of the sayd Orders, and as they finde any lacke or disorder, either to reforme it themselues, or to report it at the generall as∣sembly there, to be by a more common con∣sent reformed. 13 Item, for that the Contagion of the Plague groweth and encreaseth no way more, then by the vse and handling of such clothes, bedding and other stuffe as hath bin worne and occupyed by the Infected of this disease, during the time of their disease: the sayd Iustices shall in the places infected take such order, that all the sayde clothes and o∣ther stuffe, so occupyed by the diseased, so soone as the parties diseased of the plague are all of them either wel recouered or dead, be either burnt and cleane consumed with fire, or else ayred in such sort as is prescribed in an especiall article conteined in the Aduise set downe by the Physicians. And for that peraduenture the losse of such apparell, bed∣ding, and other stuffe to be burnt, may be greater then the poore estate of the owners of the same may wel beare: it is thought ve∣ry good and expedient, if it be thought meet it shall be burnt, that then the sayd Iustices, out of such Collections as are to bee made
within their Counties for the reliefe of the poorer sort that be infected, allow also them such summe or summes as to them shall be thought reasonable, in recompense of the losse of their sayd stuffe. 14 Item, the said Iustices may put in ex∣ecution any other Orders that by them at their generall assembly shall be deuised and thought meet, tending to the preseruation of his Maiesties Subiects from the infec∣tion: and to the end their care and diligence may the better appeare, they shall certifie in writing the said Orders newly deuised: and if any shall wilfully breake and contemne the same, or any the Orders herein specified, they shall either presently punish them by imprisonment, or if the persons so contem∣ning them, shalbe of such countenance as the Iustices shal think meet to haue their faults knowen to his Maiestie, or to the Councell, they shall charge and binde them to appeare before vs, and the contempt duely certified, that there may be a more notorious sharpe example made by punishment of the same by order of his Maiestie. 15 Item, if there be lacke of Iustices in some partes of the Shire, or if they which are Iustices there, shalbe for the time absent, in that case the more number of the Iusti∣ces at their assembly shall make choice of
some conuenient persons to supply those places for the better execution hereof. 16 Item, if there be any person Ecclesia∣sticall or Lay, that shall hold and publish any opinions (as in some places report is made) that it is a vaine thing to forbeare to resort to the Infected, or that it is not charitable to forbid the same, pretending that no person shall die but at their time prefixed, such per∣sons shall be not onely reprehended, but by order of the Bishop, if they be Ecclesiasticall, shall be forbidden to preach, and being Lay, shalbe also enioined to forbeare to vtter such dangerous opinions vpon paine of impri∣sonment, which shall bee executed, if they shal perseuere in that errour. And yet it shall appeare manifestly by these Orders, that ac∣cording to Christian charitie, no persons of the meanest degree shall be left without suc∣cour and reliefe. 17 And of these things aboue mentioned, the Iustices shall take great care, as of a matter specially directed and commaunded by his Maiestie vpon the princely and natu∣rall care he hath conceiued towards the pre∣seruation of his Subiects, who by very dis∣order, and for lacke of direction doe in many partes wilfully procure the increase of this generall Contagion.
An aduice set downe by the Col∣ledge of Physitians, by His MAIESTIES speciall Command: Containing certaine ne∣cessary Directions, as well for the cure of the Plague, as for preuenting the infection: with many easie Medicines and of small charge, the vse whereof may be very pro∣fitable to His MAIESTIES Subiects. That none come from forraine Infected places, or bring goods from thence. IT is necessarie that there be care taken, that neither men, nor goods may come from any suspected places beyond the Seas, or in the Land, without a Certifi∣cate of health, or else either to bee sent sud∣denly away, or to be put to the Pesthouse, or some such like place, till the certaintie of their soundnesse may be discouered.
That all established good Orders be reuiued. THat the Statutes and good Orders made and formerly published against common Beggars, against all manner of Playes, Bowling-allies, Inmates, Tip∣ling houses, Lestals, against the sale of corrupt Flesh or Fish, may bee reuiued and strictly executed, and that the Scauengers in generall, and euery particular Houshol∣der take care for the due and orderly clean∣sing of the streetes and priuate houses, which will auaile much in this case. That Dogs, Cats, Conies, and tame Pigeons bee destroyed about the Towne, or to bee kept so sparingly, that no offence may come by them, nor that Swine bee permitted to range vp and downe the streetes as they frequently doe; Or rather not to keepe any at all. It were also to bee wished that the Slaughter-houses were vtterly put from out the Liberties of the Citie, being in themselues very offensiue. To be Cautulous vpon any suspition. IT is to bee feared, that because euery one desireth their libertie, that none will giue
notice of any suspition of the Plague, a∣gainst themselues, wherefore it must be the ouerseers care vpon any notice or suspition of infection by the Doctors, Chirurgions, Keepers, or Searchers to finde out the trueth thereof, and so to proceede accor∣dingly. The care to be taken when a house is Visited. THat vpon the discouery of the infecti∣on in any house, there bee presently meanes vsed to preserue the whole, as well as to cure the infected, and that no sicke person be remoued out of any house, though to another of his owne, without notice thereof to be giuen to the Ouerseers, and be by them approued; Or if the whole be to be remoued, that notice be giuen to the Ouer∣seers of their remoue, and that Caution be giuen that they shal not wander about till they be sound. The house that is knowen to bee infec∣ted, though none be dead therein, to be shut vp, and carefully kept watched, till a time after the partie be well recouered, and that time to be forty dayes at the least. Caution concerning flying into the Countrey. BEcause many Masters of Families, presently vpon the visiting of the houses
before any be dead, fly into the Countrey to their friends: By which meanes the Plague, is often caried into the Country, that no man shall depart his house, except it bee to a house not inhabited, and that it bee to a house of such distance, as that hee may conueniently trauell thither without lying by the way, much lesse that hee send his children or seruants; and this to bee done by the approbation of the Ouerseers vnder their hands. That such also as remooue into the Countrey before their houses bee Visited, haue a Certificate from the Ouerseers of their Parish vnder their hands and seales testifying, that such persons were not vi∣sited before their remooue, that by vertue thereof they may the freelier trauell in the countrey, and be more readily entertained. Because it is likely that the better sort will not call to them such Doctors as are deputed to the cure of the Plague, vpon the first falling sicke of any in their houses, least thereby they might draw greater in∣fection vpon themselues: If therefore any house so vsing other Doctors shal hap∣pen to be visited, that then the Doctor who shall vndertake the care of that house, shall presently cause notice of the said infection to be giuen to the Ouerseers, that care may be had thereof.
Buriall of the Dead. THat one being dead in any house of the Plague notice bee giuen to the Ouer∣seers, and that the dead party be buried by night in priuate manner, yet not without the priuity of the Minister, Clarke, Bea∣rers and Constable or Ouerseers, and that none enter the visited house, but permitted persons, vpon danger to bee presently shut vp themselues, and that there bee a visible Marke set vpon the outside of the doore, and so to stand shut vp forty dayes. Caution about apparell and houshold stuffe. THat no apparell nor houshold-stuffe be remooued or sold, out of the infected house for three moneths after the infection is ceased in the house, and that all the Bro∣kers and inferiour Cryers for apparell bee restrained in that behalfe. No visited person to be secretly remoued without Licence. THat no infected person be secretly con∣uered out of any house, and in any such misdemeanour, the Master of the house both from which the sicke party is sent, as
also the master of the house, into which the partie shall be receiued without the licence of the Ouerseers of both Parishes respec∣tiuely, shall be seuerely punished, at the di∣scretion of the Ouerseers. Doctors, Apothecaries, and Chirurgions. THat by the gouernment of the Citie, there bee appointed sixe or foure Doc∣tors at the least, who may ioyntly and se∣uerally apply themselues and their studies to the cure of the Infected, and staying of the Infection, and that these Doctors bee Stipendaries to the Citie for their liues, and that to each Doctor there bee assigned two honest Apothecaries, and three Chi∣rurgions, who are also to bee stipended by the Citie, that so due and true care may be taken in all things that the people perish not without helpe, and that the Infection spread not, while none takes particular care to resist it, as in Paris, Venice, and Pa∣dua, and many other Cities. If any Doctor, Apothecary, or Chirur∣gion stipended by the Citie, shall happen to die in the seruice of the attendance of the Plague, that then their Widowes surui∣uing, shall haue the moitie of their pension during their liues.
Publique Prayers. ABoue all things Prayers must be pub∣liquely made in euery Parish, humbly to intreat God to bee mercifull to his peo∣ple, and that he will not powre out the vi∣als of his wrath vpon vs, according to our iust deseruings, but in mercie will be plea∣sed to hold his auenging hand, & to stay the destroyer of his people, and that he will be pleased to blesse his Maiesties care, and en∣deauors of the Magistrates and inferiour Officers for the staying of the Infection, and that hee will blesse such good meanes, as are, and shal be directed by the Doctors in this so dangerous a Visitation. Preseruatiues. By Correction of the Ayre. FOr the correcting of the infectious Ayre, it were good that often Bonefires were made in the streetes, and that sometimes the Tower-Ordnance might bee shot off, as also that there be good fires kept in and about the visited houses, and their neigh∣bours. Take Rosemary dried, or Iuniper, Bay∣leaues, or Frankincense, cast the same vpon a Chafendish, and receiue the fume or smoke
thereof: Some aduise to bee added Lauen∣der or Sage. Also to make Fires rather in Pannes, to remooue about the chamber, then in Chim∣neys, shall better correct the Ayre of the houses. Take a quantitie of Vineger very strong, and put to it some small quantitie of Rose∣water, ten branches of Rosemary, put them all into a bason, then take fiue or sixe Flint∣stones heated in the fire till they be burning hote, cast them into the same Vineger, and so let the fumes bee receiued from place to place of your house. That the house be often perfumed with Rue, Angelica, Gentian, Zedoary, Setwall, Iuni∣per wood, or Berries, burnt vpon imbers, ei∣ther simply, or they may be steeped in Wine-vineger, and so burnt. Greene Coppris burnt in an earthen potte, and cast hot into Vineger, there∣with perfume the house and all therein, or with this Slake Lime in Vineger, and aire the house therewith, burne much Tarre, Ro∣sen, Frankincense, or Turpentine, both in pri∣uate Houses and in the Churches before Prayers. By perfuming of Apparell. SVch apparell as you shall commonly weare, let it be very cleane, and perume
it often either with some red Saunders bur∣ned, or with Iuniper: And if any shall hap∣pen to be with them that are visited, let such persons as soone as they shall come home, shift themselues, and ayre their clothes in open ayre for a time. By carrying about of Perfumes. SVch as are to goe abroad shall doe well to carry Rue, Angelica, or Zedoarie in their hands to smell to, and of those they may chew a little in their mouthes as they goe in the streete, especially if they bee afraid of any place. It is not good to be ouer fearful; and it cannot bee but bad to bee ouer pre∣sumptuous and bold. Take Rue one handfull, stamp it in a mor∣ter, put thereto Wine-Vineger enough to moisten it, mixe them well, then straine out the iuyce, wette a piece of spoonge, or a toste of browne bread therein, tye it in a thinne cloth, beare it about to smell to. Or this. TAke the roote of Angelica beaten grosly, the weight of sixe pence, of Rue and Wormewood, of each the weight of foure pence, Setwall the weight of three pence, bruise these, then steepe them in a little
Wine Vineger, tye them in a linnen cloth, which they may carrie in their hands, or put it into a Iuniper boxe full of holes to smell to. Or they may vse this Pomander. TAke Angelica, Rue, Zedoarie, of each halfe a dramme, Myrrhe two drammes, Cam∣phire sixe graines, Waxe and Labdanum of each two drammes, more or lesse as shall bee thought fitte to mixe with the other things, make hereof a Ball to carrie a∣bout you, you may easily make a hole in it, and so weare it about your necke with a string. The richer sort may make vse of this Pomander. TAke Citron Pils, Angelica seeds, Ze∣doarie, Red Rose leaues of each halfe a dramme, yellow Saunders, Lignum aloes of each one scruple, Galliae Moschatae foure scruples, Storaxe, Calamit, Beuzoni, of each one dramme, Camphire sixe graines, Labdanum three drammes, Gum Tra∣garanth dissolued in Rose-water enough to make it vp into a Pomander, put thereto sixe drops of spirit of Roses, enclose it in an iuory boxe, or weare it about your necke.
Also it is good in going abroad in the open aire in the streets to hold some things of sweet sauour in their hands, or in the corner of a handkerchiefe, as a sponge dip∣ped in Vineger and Rose-water mixed, or in Vineger wherewith Wormewood or Rue called also Herbegrace hath beene boyled. Take the roote of Enula Campana, being laid and steeped in Vineger and grosse bea∣ten, put a little of it in a handkerchiefe, and smell to it if you resort to any that is infected. It shall bee good to take a handfull of Rue, and as much common Wormewood, and bruise them a little, and put them into a pot of Earth or Tinne, with so much Vineger as shall couer the herbes, keepe this pot close couered or stopt, and when you feare any infection, dip into this Vi∣neger a piece of a sponge, & carry it in your hand, and smell to it, or else put it into a round Ball of Yuory or Iuniper, made full of holes of the one side, carying it in your hand, vse to smell thereunto, renewing it once a day. By inward Medicines. LEt none goe fasting forth, euery one ac∣cording to their fortunes, let them eate
some such thing as may resist putrefaction. Some may eate Garlicke with Butter, a Cloue two or three according to the abi∣litie of their bodies; some may eate fasting some of the electuary with Figs and Rue hereafter expressed: Some may vse Lon∣don Treacle, the weight of eight pence in a morning, taking more or lesse, according to the age of the party after one houre let them eate some other breakefast, as bread and butter with some leaues of Rue or Sage, nd in the heate of Summer of Sorrell, or wood Sorrell. To steepe Rue, Wormwood, or Sage all night in their drinke, and to drinke a good draught in the morning fasting is very wholesome▪ or to drinke a draught of such drine after the taking any of the preser∣uatiues will be very good. In all Summer Plagues, it shall bee good to vse Sorell sauce, to bee eaten in the morning with bread. And in the fall of the leafe to vse the iuice of Barberies with bread also. Take of the powder of good Baberies the huske taken away from them, before they be dryed, a spoonefull: let the patient drinke this well mingled in a draught of good stale Ale or Beere, which is neither sowre nor dead, or with a draught of white Wine, and goe to bed, and cast himselfe in a
sweat, and forbeare sleepe. Take the inward barke of the Ash-tree, a pound of Walnuts, with the greene out∣ward shels, to the number of fifty, cut these small; of Scabious, of Veruen, of Petimorel, of Housleeke, of euery one a handfull, of Saffron halfe an ounce, powre vpon these the stron∣gest Vineger you can get foure pints▪ let them a little boyle together vpon a very soft fire, and then stand in a very close pot well stopt all a night vpon the Embers, af∣ter distill them with a soft fire, and receiue the water close kept. Giue vnto the Pati∣ent laid in bed and well couered with cloathes two ounces of this Water to drinke, and let him be prouoked to sweat, and euery sixe houres during the space of twenty foure houres, giue him the same quantitie to drinke. This Medicine for the worthinesse thereof and because it will stand the maner thereof in little charge, it shall be very well done to distill it in Sum∣mer, when the Walnuts hng greene vpon the tree, that it may bee ready against the time that occasion serueth to vse it. After Infection. FOrasmuch as the cause of the Plague standeth rather in poyson, then in any putrfaction of humours, as other Agues
doe, the chiefest way is to moue sweatings, and to defend the heart by some Cordiall thing. Cordials. Mithridates Medicine of Figgs. TAke of good Figgs and Walnuts, of each twenty foure, Rue picked, two good handfuls, Salt halfe an ounce, or some what better, first stampe your Figgs and walnuts well together in a stone mor∣ter, then adde your Rue, and last of all your Salt, mixe them exceedingly well, take of this mixture euery morning fast∣ing the weight of sixteen pence: to children and weake bodies lesse. Or this will be more effectuall. TAke twenty Walnuts, pill them, Figs fifteene, Rue a good handful, Tormen∣til roots three drams, Iuniper berries two drams, Bole-Armoniack a dram & a halfe; first stampe your roots then your Figs and Seeds, then adde your Walnuts, then put to your Rue and Bole, and with them put thereto sixe drammes of London Treacle, and two or three spoonefuls of Wine-vine∣ger, mixe them well in a stone morter, and take of this euery morning the quantity of
a good Nutmeg fasting, they that haue cause to goe much abroad may take as much more in the euening two houres be∣fore supper. For women with child, Children, and such as cannot take bitter things vse this. TAke conserue of Roses, Wood-Sorrel, of each two ounces, conserues of Bor∣rage, of Sage-flowers, of each sixe drams, Bole-armoniake, shauings of Harts-horn, Sorrell-seeds, of each two drams, Yellow or White Saunders halfe a dramme, Saf∣fron one scruple, Sirrop of Wood-sorrell enough to make it a moist electuary, mixe them well, take so much as a Chesnut at a time, once or twice a day as you shall finde cause. Take the shauings of Harts-horne, Ma∣gistery of Pearl, Magistery of Coral, Tor∣mentil Rootes, Zedoarie, true Terra Sigilla∣ta, of each one dramme, Citron Pills, Yel∣low White and Red Sanders, of each halfe a dramme, white Amber, Hyacinth∣stone prepared, of each two scruples, Be∣zoar Stone, of the East Vnicornes horne, of each foure and twenty graines, Citron and Orenge pils canded, of each three drammes, Lignum Aloes, one scruple, Am∣ber-grease and Muske, of each eight
graines, white Sugar Candy, twice the weight of all the rest, mixe them well being made into a dredge powder, take the weight of twelue pence at a time euery morning fasting, and also in the euening about fiue a clocke, or an houre before Supper. With these powders and Sugar there may be made Lozenges, or Manus Christies and with conuenient conserues they may be made into Electuaries. All which and many more, for their health they may haue by the aduice and directions of their owne Physicians, or at least Physicians wil not bee wanting to direct them as they may haue neede. They may also vse Bezoar Water, or Treacle Water, or Saxonias cold cordiall Water, which they may vse simply, or they may mixe them also with all their Anti∣dotes as occasion shall require. The vse of London Treacle is good both to preserue from the sicknesse, as also to cure the sicknesse, being taken vpon the first apprehension in a greater quantitie, as to a man two drammes, but lesse to a weake body or a child, in Cardius or Dra∣gon Water. Take of the finest cleere Aloes you can buy, in colour like to a Liuer, and therefore called Hepatica, of Cinamom, of Myrrhe, of
each of these the weight of three French Crownes, or of two and twenty pence of our money, of Cloues, Maces, Lignum A∣loes, of Masticke of Bole-Oriental, of each of these halfe an ounce, mingle them toge∣ther, & beat them into a very fine powder, of the which take euery morning fasting the weight of a groat of this in White Wine delayed with water, and by the grace of God you shall bee safe from the Plague. No man which is learned if hee examine the Simples of this Medicine whereof it consisteth, and the nature and power of them can deny, but that it is a Medicine of great efficacie against the Plague, and the Simples whereof it is made, are easily to be had in any good Apo∣thecaries shop, except Bole-Orientall, which is vsed in the stead of true Bolus Armenus. Take a dry Figge and open it, and put the kernell of a Walnut into the same, be∣ing cut very small, three or foure leaues of Rue commonly called Herbegrace, a corne of Salt, then roste the Figge, and eate it warme, fast three or foure houres after it, and vse this twice in the weeke. Take the powder of Tormentill the weight of sixe pence with Sorrell or Sca∣bious Water in Summer, and in Winter with the Water of Valerian or common drinke.
Or else, in one day they may take a little Wormwood and Valerian, with a graine of Salt, in another day they may take se∣uen or eight Berries of Iuniper dried and put in powder, and taking the same with common drinke, or with drinke in which Wormewood and Rue hath beene steeped all night. Also the Treacle called Diatessaroum, which is made but of foure things of light price, easie to be had. Also the roote of Enula Campana, either taken in powder with drinke, or hanged a∣bout the brest. Likewise a piece of Arras Roote kept in the mouth as men passe in the streets is ve∣ry good Cordiall. Take sixe leaues of Sorrell, wash them with Water and Vineger, let them lye in the said Water and Vineger a while. then eate them fasting, and keepe in your mouth and chew now and then either Setwall, or the Roote of Angelica, or a little Ci∣namom. Medicines Purgatiue. IT is good for preuention to keepe the bo∣die reasonable open, especially with such things as are easie of operation, and good to resist putrefaction, such are these Pils
which are vsually to bee had at good Apo∣thecaries, and are called Pestilentiall Pilles. Take Aloes two ounces, Myrrhe and Saffron, of each one ounce, Ammoniacum halfe an ounce, make them vp into a masse with the iuice of Limons, or white Wine vineger, to keepe the bodie open, a small Pill or two will bee enough taken a little before supper, or before dinner, but to purge the bodie, take the weight of a dramme, made into fiue, or sixe, or more Pilles, in the morning fasting, and that day keepe your chamber. If the patient bee costiue and bound in his body, let him take a suppositary made with a little boyled Honie, and a little fine powder of Salt, and so taken in at the Fundament, and kept till it mooue a Stoole. For the poore take Aloes the weight of sixe pence, put in the pappe of an Apple, and for the richer, Pilles of Rufus to be had in euery Apothecaries Shop. ¶ Blood-letting. IF the Patient be full of humors which be good, let him immediatly bee Let-blood vpon the Liuer Veine in the right arme, or in the Median Veine of the
same Arme (if no Sore appeare) in the first day. Such as are tyed to necessary atten∣dance on the infected, as also such as liue in Visited houses, shall doe well to cause Issues to be made in their left Armes, or right Legs, or both, as the Doctor shall thinke fit. For Blood-letting, Purging, and ma∣king of Issues there must be particular di∣rections had from the Doctors, according to the constitution of the parties. These preparations thus vsed, the first day that the patient shall fall sicke, as cause shall be to vse the one or the other (no Sore appearing) in which case if the Sore shal appeare, they are both to be forborne, the next is to vse all meanes to expell the poy∣son, and to defend the heart by Cordials. Medicines Expulsiue. THe poyson is expelled best by sweat∣ings, prouoked by Posset-ale, made with Fennell and Marigolds in Winter; and with Sorrell, Buglosse, and Borage in Summer, with the which in both times they must mixe the Treacle of Diatessaroū, the weight of nine pence, & so to lay themselues with all quietnes to sweat one halfe houre, or an houre, if they bee
strong; For they that be neither full of hu∣mors, nor corrupt in humors, neither need purging, nor letting of blood, but at the first plunge may mooue themselues to sweate with Cordiall things, mixt with such things as mooue sweat. Medicines Internall. FOr the Cure of the Infected vpon the first apprehension, Burre Seedes, Cu∣cheneely, powder of Harts-horne, Citron Seedes, one or more of them with a few graines of Camphire, are good to be giuen in Carduus or Dragon water, or with some Treacle water.

¶ Orders conceiued and agreed to be published by the Lord Maior and Aldermen of the Citie of London, and the Iustices of Peace of the Counties of Middlesex and Surrey, by direction from the Lords of His Maiesties most Honourable Priuy Councell. WHereas in the first yeere of the Reigne of our late Soue∣raigne, King Iames of happy memory, ouer this Realme of England, an Act was made, for the charitable reliefe and Ordering of persons infected with the Plague: wherby Authoritie is giuen to Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Bayliffes, and other head Offi∣cers, to appoint within their seuerall Li∣mits Examiners, Searchers, Watchmen, Keepers, and Buriers for the persons and places infected, and to minister vnto them Oathes for the performance of their Offi∣ces. And the same Statute also authori∣seth the giuing of other Directions, as vn∣to them for the present necessity shall seeme good in their discretions. It is therefore
vpon speciall consideration thought very expedient, for the preuenting and auoiding of the Infection of Sicknesse (if it shall please Almighty God) which is now dan∣gerously dispersed into many places with∣in the City and Suburbs of the same: that these Officers following bee appointed, and these Orders hereafter prescribed bee duely obserued.

THis day Rice Griffin and Iohn Scrips were brought to the Barre, against whome Edward Coke E∣squire, her Maiesties At∣tourney Generall did en∣forme, That the said Grif∣fin had vnlawfully erected and built one Tenement in Hog-lane in the Countie of
Middlesex, which hee diuided into two seue∣rall roumes, wherein were now inhabiting two poore Tenants, that onely liued and were maintained by the reliefe of the Pari∣shioners there, and begging abroad in other places: And that the said Iohn Scrips had in like sort diuided a Tenement in Shordich, in∣to, or about seuenteene Tenancies or dwel∣lings, and the same inhabited by diuers per∣sons of very poore and base condition, con∣trary to the intent and meaning of her Highnesse Proclamation, published and set out the seuenth day of Iuly 1580, in the two and twentieth yeere of her High∣nesse Reigne, whereby the same, and such maner of buildings and diuisions, are alto∣gether forbidden and prohibited, as by her Maiesties said Proclamation more at large appeareth. Moreouer, her highnesse said Attourney further informed this Honourable Court, that sithence the sayd Proclamation, sun∣drie Decrees haue been made and taken by this Court, aswell for the prostrating, pul∣ling downe, and defacing of diuers new Buildings: as also for reformation of diui∣sions of Tenements: All which notwith∣standing, sundry wilfull and disobedient persons, continue in their contemptuous maner of buildings & diuisions: by meanes whereof, the City of London, and Suburbs therof, are ouercharged, and burdened with
sundry sorts of poore, beggerly, and euill dis∣posed persons, to the great hinderance and oppression of the same; So as the Magi∣strates and Officers in and about the Citie, to whom the due execution of the aforesayd Decrees and Orders chiefly appertaineth, cannot performe and doe the same, accor∣ding to the purport and tenor thereof: And in regard thereof, her Highnesse said Attour∣ney humbly prayed, that the sayd Griffin and Scrips might receiue, and haue inflicted on them, some condigne and fit punishment, and that at the humble petition of the Lord Maior and Aldermen of the Citie of Lon∣don, and other the Iustices of Peace of the Countie of Middlesex and Surrey, the Court would bee pleased to set downe and decree, some last and generall Order in this and in all other like cases of new Buildings, and diuisions of Tenements. Whereupon the Court grauely considering the great growing euils and inconueniences that continually breed and happen by these new erected buildings and diuisions made and diuided contrary to her Maiesties sayd Pro∣clamation, and well weighing the reasons of the sayd Lord Maior and Aldermen of the sayd Citie and Iustices of the Counties a∣foresayd in that behalfe, greatly tendering the ouerburdened and distressed estate of the inhabitants that dwell in sundry the Pari∣shes where the sayd new Buildings and de∣uided
Tenements are, being for the most part but of small ability to beare and su∣staine the great charge which is to growe there by meanes of the poore placed in sun∣dry of the new erected and diuided Tene∣ments, Haue therefore by the whole and ge∣nerall consent of all the honourable presence here sitting, hearing the accusations afore∣said, and the answeres, defences, and alle∣gations of the said Griffin and Scrips, ordered and decreed, that the sayd Griffin and Scrips shal be committed to the prison of the Fleete, and pay twentie pounds a piece for a Fine to her Maiestie. And as for the pul∣ling downe, or reforming of any house new built or diuided sithence and contrary to the said Proclamation, within the Citie of London, or the compasse of three miles thereof, in which any poore or Impotent persons now doe or hereafter shall dwell or abide, for that if the same Houses should be pulled downe, destroyed, or reformed, other Habitations must bee prouided for them at the charge of the Parishes where they be or shalbe dwelling, The Court doeth as yet thinke fit to forbeare and respit the doing thereof, and haue ordered and adiudged that all and euery such poore and impotent per∣sons, which dwel or shall dwell and inhabite in any new buildings, or diuided tenements erected & diuided, contrary to the effect and intent of her Highnesse said Proclamation,
and are or shal in any wise be driuē to liue by begging, or to be relieued by almes within the City of Londō or any other place within the compasse of three miles thereof, shall and may during the time of his or their life or liues, abide and dwell in the same, without giuing or paying any maner of Rent, seruice or other recompence vnto the Landlords or any other, for and in respect of the same, and not be thence remooued, vnlesse they shall af∣ter become able to liue of themselues, And that the said Landlord, owner, or any other that claimeth Interest to or for any Rent or Rents growing, arising, or payable for any of the said new Buildings or diuided Tene∣ments, so inhabited or to be inhabited with poore people as aforesaid, shall hereby be en∣ioyned, and vpon this Sentence and Decree take sufficient notice and warning, that hee or they doe not impleade, encumber, disquiet or molest any of the said poore Tenants, for any Rents, Couenants, Conditions, promi∣ses or agreements, touching or in any wise concerning the said Tenements, new buil∣dings, or any of them, for the leuying or reco∣uering of any Rent, seruice, or other conside∣ration in lieu of any Rent. And for that the new buildings and diuisions of sundry hou∣ses, within the Citie of London and three miles compasse thereof contrary to the tenor of the sayd Proclamation, hath beene and is the occasion of great charges vnto the
Parishes of the sayd Citie and Precinct a∣foresaid, whereby the said Parishes are still ouermuch burdened with poore and impo∣tent persons, It is therefore ordered and decreed, That all such Landlords or owners of such Buildings or Diuisions wheresoe∣uer they should dwell, shall contribute and giue such like ratable and reasonable allow∣ance with the said Parishioners where such Buildings and Diuisions are, towards the finding and maintaining of the poore of the Parish, in which such Buildings are, is, or shalbe erected or diuided contrary to the said Proclamation, as should be apportioned and allotted him or them to pay, if hee or they were dwelling in the said Parish. And it is further ordered and decreed by this Honourable Court, that after the death or departure of such poore people as doe or shall inhabite the same houses or diuided Tenements aforesaid, the houses thereby being become voide, Then the Lord Mayor and Iustices of Peace neere vnto the Citie adioyning, hereby are commaunded to re∣forme the said diuided Tenements, and to prostrate, pull downe and deface the said new buildings in such sort, as the same bee no more left fit for habitation, and the tim∣ber and wood thereof to be conuerted and disposed in such manner as by the sayd Pro∣clamation is required: As also to take order in all other the premisses, That this De∣cree
