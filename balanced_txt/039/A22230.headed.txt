¶ By the King. ¶ A Proclamation for restraint of the disordered trading for Tobacco. WHereas Wee, out of the dislike Wee had of the vse of Tobacco, tending to a generall and new corruption both of mens bodies and maners, and yet neuerthelesse holding it of the two more tolerable, that the same should be imported amongst ma∣ny other vanities and superfluities, which came from beyond the Seas, then permitted to be planted here within this Realme, there∣by to abuse and misimploy the soile of this fruitfull Kingdome, did by Our Proclamation dated the thirtieth day of December now last past straitly charge and commaund all and euery person and per∣sons, of what degree or condition soeuer, That they or any of them by themselues, their seruants, workemen or labourers, should not from and after the second day of February then next following, presume to sow, set or plant, or cause to be sowen, set or planted within this Our Realme of England and the Dominion of Wales, any sort or kinde of Tobacco whatsoeuer, and that they, or any of them, should not maintaine or continue any olde stockes or plants of Tobacco formerly sowen or planted, but should forthwith vtterly destroy and root vp the same. And whereas We haue taken into Our Royall consideration aswell the great waste and consumption of the wealth of Our Kingdomes, as the endangering & impairing the health of Our Subiects, by the inordinate libertie and abuse of Tobacco, being a weede of no necessary vse, and but of late yeeres brought into Our Dominions, and being credibly informed, that di∣uers Tobacconists, and other meane persons taking vpon them to trade and aduenture into the parts beyond the Seas for Tobacco, to the intent to forestall and engrosse the said commoditie, vpon vnmerchantlike conditions, doe transport much Gold bullion and Coyne out of Our King∣domes, and doe barter and vent the Staple commodities of Our Realme at vnder-values, to the intent to buy Tobacco, to the discredit of Our natiue merchandizes, and extreame enhansing of the rates and prices of Tobacco, and the great disturbance and decay of the Trade of the or∣derly and good Merchant: We taking the premisses into Our Princely consideration, and being desirous to put a remedie to the said inconueniences, which Wee haue long endeauoured, though with lesse effect then Wee expected, haue resolued to make some further redresse, by restraining the disordered traffique in that Commoditie, and reducing it into the hands of able persons that may manage the same without inconuenience, whereby the generall abuse may be taken away, and the necessary vse (if any be) may be preserued. We doe therefore not only by these presents, straitly charge and commaund, That Our said Proclamation restraining the planting of To∣bacco, be in euery respect obserued and performed according to the tenour thereof, vpon the pe∣nalties therein contained; but also that no person or persons whatsoeuer, Englishmen, Deni∣zens or Strangers, (other then such as shall be authorized and appointed thereunto by Letters Patents vnder Our great Seale of England) doe import or cause to be imported into this Our Realme of England or Dominion of Wales, or any part of them or either of them, any Tobacco, of what nature, kind, or sort soeuer, after the tenth day of Iuly next ensuing the date hereof, from any the parts beyond the Seas, vpon paine of forfeiture to Us of all such Tobacco so to be im∣ported contrary to the true meaning of these Presents, and vpon such further paines and penal∣ties as by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, or by the seueritie or censure of Our Court of Starrechamber may be inflicted vpon the offendors, for contempt of this Our Royall com∣mand. And likewise that no Master, Merchant, or Purser of any Ship or other Uessell, doe at any time or times after the said tenth day of Iuly, presume or attempt to take into their ships to be imported into this Realme and Dominion, or either of them, any sort, maner, or quantity of Tobacco whatsoeuer, but onely to the vse of such person and persons as shalbe so as aforesaid authorized and appointed vnder Our great Seale of England to import the same, & which shalbe by them, their deputies, seruants or factors deliuered to the said Masters, Merchants or Pursers of ships to be imported, vpon the paines and penalties aforesaid. And to the intent that no such offendor may colour or hide his offence and contempt, by sha∣dowing the Tobacco to be brought in, contrary to Our pleasure before expressed, vnder pretence of former store, We doe hereby signifie and declare Our will and pleasure, and doe straitly charge and command, That all and euery person and persons which now haue, or hereafter shall haue within or neere the Cities of London or Westminster, in their hands, custody or possession, any Tobacco heretofore imported, or hereafter and before
the said tenth day of Iuly now next ensu∣ing  to be imported into this Realme, amounting to the quantitie of ten pounds weight or aboue, shall before the said tenth day of Iuly now next comming, bring the same vnto the house com∣monly called, The Hawke and Feasant, situate in Cornehill in the said Citie of London, and shall cause the same to be there sealed and marked by such person and persons, and with such marke or Seale as by Us shalbe for that purpose assigned and appointed, without giuing any Fee or al∣lowance for the said Seale or marke. And to the intent that the Tobacco to be hereafter imported by Warrant or Authoritie vnder Our great Seale, may be knowen and distinguished from such as shall be secretly and without Warrant brought in by stealth, We doe likewise charge and command, that all such Tobacco as from and after the said tenth day of Iuly shall be imported by force of any such Warrant or Au∣thoritie and none other, except the olde store aforesaid to be sealed as aforesaid, shall be sealed and marked with such Seale and marke as aforesaid. And we doe hereby prohibite all person and persons from and after the said tenth day of Iuly, to buy, vtter, sell or vent within the said King∣dome and Dominion, or either of them, any Roll or other grosse quantitie of Tobacco whatsoe∣uer, before the same be so as aforesaid marked or sealed, vpon paine of forfeiture vnto Us of all such Tobacco so bought, vttered, solde or vented contrary to the intent of these Presents, and vp∣on such further penalties as by Our Lawes, or by the censure of Our Court of Starrechamber may be inflicted vpon the offenders, as contemners of Our Royall command. And for the better execution of this Our Pleasure, Wee doe hereby command all and singular Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, and other officers attending in all and euery the Ports, Creekes, or places of lading or vnlading, for the taking, collecting, or receiuing of any Our Customes, Subsidies or other duties, to take notice of this Our pleasure; and We do hereby com∣mand, and giue power and authority vnto them, and euery or any of them, from time to time, as well to search any Ship or other Uessell or Bottome, riding or lying within any Port, Hauen or Creeke within their seuerall Charge and place of attendance, for all Tobacco imported contrary to the intent of this Our Proclamation, and the same being found, to seize and take to Our vse, as also to take notice of the names, and apprehend the bringers in, and buyers of the same, to the end they may receiue condigne punishment for their offences, vpon paine that euery of the said Offi∣cers which shalbe found negligent, remisse or corrupt therein, shall lose his place and entertain∣ment, and vndergoe such paines and penalties as by Our Lawes, or the censure of Our said Court of Starrechamber may be inflicted vpon them for the same. And likewise We doe hereby will, ordaine and appoint, That it shal and may be lawfull to and for such person and persons, as shalbe so as aforesaid authorized and appointed by Letters Pa∣tents vnder Our great Seale, to import Tobacco by himselfe or themselues, or his or their Depu∣tie or Deputies, with a lawfull Officer to enter into any suspected places at lawfull and conueni∣ent times, and there search, discouer and finde out any Tobacco imported, vttered, solde or ven∣ted, not marked or sealed as aforesaid, contrary to the true meaning hereof, and all such Tobacco so found, to seize, take away and dispose of, and the owners thereof, or in whose custody the same shalbe found, to informe and complaine of, to the end they may receiue punishment according to Our pleasure before herein declared. And further We doe by these Presents will and require all and singular Mayors, Sheriffes, Iustices of Peace, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughes, Customers, Comptrollers, Sear∣chers, Waiters, and all other Our Officers and Ministers whatsoeuer, That they and euery of them in their seuerall places and offices be diligent and attendant in the execution of this Our Proclamation, and also aiding and assisting vnto such person and persons, and his and their De∣puties and Assignes as We shall so as aforesaid authorize and appoint to import Tobacco, aswell in any search for discouery of any acte or actes to be performed contrary to the intent of these Pre∣sents, as otherwise in the doing or executing of any matter or thing forthe accomplishment of this Our Royall Command. And lastly Our will and pleasure is, and Wee doe hereby charge and command Our Atturney generall for the time being, to informe against such persons in Our Court of Starrechamber from time to time, whose contempt and disobedience against this Our Royall command shall merit the censure of that Court. Giuen at Our Manour of Greenwich the nine and twentieth day of Iune, in the eighteenth yeere of Our Reigne of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the three and fiftieth. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, and Iohn Bill, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. ANNO DOM. M.DC.XX.
