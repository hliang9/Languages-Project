¶ A declara∣cion of the Seremo¦nies a nexid, to the Sacrament of Baptyme, what they sygnyffie and how we owght to vnderstan∣de them (:) 1537.
Whan a christē man∣nis chylde is born̄ into this worlde it is brought to chur∣che and .iii. witnes∣ses comyth with, hym that is God fader and godmo∣ther and whā they be a greed what name shalbe to ye chyld, thā ye prest makyth a signe of the crosse ī ye for∣hed of the chyld & seyth thus. A tokē of the holy crosse of our lorde. Iesu christ I set in thy forhed and so at ye breste in lyk manere, & thā ye prest seith many orisons ouer the chylde comaundynge the deuel to knolech hys sentense and gyue worshipe to the lyuynge god and trewe and to Iesu christ and to the holy ghost and departe frō this seruaūt of god & than he puttyth salt in to ye mouth of the chyld & seith thus a. Thou
salt of wysdom yt god be mercyfull to the in to euerlastynge lyfe. Amē. This salt of wysdom vnderstande godd{is} word whiche shulde be ler∣ned in the mouth of ye chylde whan∣ne it begynneth to speke as the A∣postel seith be our word sauord wt salt euermore in grace than ye prest weetyth his thōbe ī spotil and tou∣chith ye chyld{is} eere & seith. Be thou openyd yt is vnderstande in alle thy fyue wittys to here & speke ye word of god with loue & drede and holy deuocion. For the Iudgemēt of god shall touche in whiche we shulde yelde acount of euery ydel word al∣so the prest toucheth ye nose thrylles of ye chyld for it shold smylle ye odour of swetnes of heuenly thyngis, mo∣re than euery ertly thynges. Sone after this the prest biddith alle the peple yt ther be, to seye a. Pater no∣ster
and an. Aue and a. Credo byse∣kyng god that the child may right∣fully take his christendom, & well kepe it to ye endyng of his lyfe. And thanne the prest takyth the chyld by the right hande and callyth his na∣me and seyth come thou in to the tē¦ple of god that thou may haue euer∣lastyng lyfe and lyue ī to worlde of worldis. Amen. Thanne the chylde is brought to the fonte and the prest callyth it by name and seyth. Abra∣nuucio satane & omnibus operibus eius et omnibus pompis eius that is. I for sake satanas that is the de∣uyl and alle his werkis & alle his pompis or prydes and ye godsibbis sayth. Abranuncio that is I for sa∣ke Therfore wher he is not a fals christen man that kepith not the co∣uenaunt of these wordis but after ward wrappyth hym in the fendis
pryde in hert and ī clothyng and in wycked worckynge for yf this coue¦naunt shuld be trewly kept, all the tokenes of pryde ī man must be don a way seyng eche token of pryde, is a pompe of the fende. After seyth the prest to the chylde by leuest thou in god the fader almyhgty maker of he uene and erthe The chyld is dombe and may not speke but and yt were of age and myght speke yt shuld ās∣were for it self therfore ye godsibbis answere seyng. Credo. that I bele∣ue. Efte axith ye prest, & beleuest thou ī Iesu christ his only sone our lord born and sufferd & they saye I bele∣ue. The thride tyme areth the prest. And beleuest thou in the holy ghost in holy churche fayth in communi∣on of saintes for geuenes of synnes the rysyng of fleshe and after the euer lastynge lyfe. And they saye
I beleue thā sayth ye prest. Quid pe∣tis what axist thou they sey baptim wold thou be baptised seth ye prest and they say, Volo I wole than the prest takyth the chylde and sayth. I Baptise the in ye name of the father and of the sone and of ye holy ghost Amen. And so he plungyth it in the water and commaundyth the gossi∣pis to ley hōd on ye chyldes heed for they ben wytnesses of his Baptim & receue ye charge to teach it and ye trewthe of his beleue yt is ye cōmaū∣dementis & the domes of god, and to flee the pompis and prydes of the fend, for the comen peple & all men shuld knowe and kepe the cōmaun¦dementis of god. And prestis his holy counseyles. And Lordis his iust domes, and yf they do not this: they be wrongfully called christen men. And thus blinde prestis bere
fals wytnesses of yong chyldren christened, that after warde serue ye deuel whome they for looke seying Abronuncio After these thyngis the prest a noyntyth ye chylde wyth oyle and lappyd in his crisome & takith yt a candele brinnyng in his hond, and seyth. Accipe lampadem arden∣tem irriprehensibilem custodi Bap∣tysmum tuum serua mandata vt cū¦venit dominus ad nuptias possis occurrere ei vna cum sanctis in au∣la celestis vt habeas vitā eternam et viuas in secula seculorum. Amē. That is to sey. Haue thou a brēnynge lampe vnreprouable. Kepe thou thy baptym & kepe thou ye cōmaūde∣mentis that whā the Lorde cometh to the weddyngis thou mayst renne agenst hym as one wyth seyntis in ye heuenly halle yt thou haue euer lastynge lyfe and lyue ī to ye world
of world{is}. am̄ Here endith ye reulys of baptī. But alle christē folk shul∣de besily lerne to know ye gretnes of charge whiche they receue ī ther baptym. For wyth .iiii. thyngis we be chargyd in our Baptī al though blinde prestis knowe yt not, whan they geue to vs iiii. Elamentis in tokenyng of thē, that is salt, & wa∣ter, and oyle, & fier. The fyrst charge is that we take salt of wysdom of godd{is} word and rewle our lyfe ther after and salt our soules that they stynk not in synne. For and thys he¦uenly salt fayle fro men they shulde be cast out as christ techyth in the gospel. The .ii. charge is, that our eeris be openyd euer more redy to here chrystes gospel and vnderstan¦de yt. For christ seyth. He that hath eerys of herynge, Let him here & he yt redyth let him vnderstande. The
iii. charge is this that we kepe our Baptym that is ye couenaunt of our Baptym and trew beleue in the fa∣ther and the sone and the holy ghost as the prest apposith vs whan we saye. Credo. The .iiii. charge is this that we kepe the commaundemen∣tis of god, as the prest commaūdith vs at ye fonte puttyng a candel brē∣nynge in our hand, for as a candille brennynge is wastyd by fyer: so syn¦nes in our soul shulde be wastyd and destroyed wyth kepyng of the commaundementis of god, hauyng deuout loue to hym and to our euen christen. And this is the seconde Baptym, that saynt Iohn. techyth whan he sayth I Baptyse in water but a nother shall come after me strongir than I and he shall Bap∣tyse you in the holy ghost and fyer and wyth out this seconde. Bap∣tym
may no man be saued, as christ seyde to Nichodeme truly I saye to the: But a mā be born a gen of wa∣ter and of the holy ghost he may not enter in to the Kyngdom of god. Al¦so Paul techyth that the fyrst Bap∣tym in water only, makyth vs not saef, But the axinge of a good con∣sciēce ī god & fayth not fayned ye be∣leue yt worckyth by charite for christ sayth. He that beleuyth in me flodis of quyk water shulde flow fro hys wombe that is the holy ghost that chryst callyth the cōfortour, whyche flowyth euer in to the hertis of me∣ke men that make them redy to die, for that man that shall dwelle by fo¦re the blessed face of god in heuene, shall receue ye ernest of the holy gost here in erthe. And this is the second Baptym that fleshely prestis and swynysh peple knowyth not, for
ther hertis be stoppyd wyth fleshly lust, that the flodis of the holy ghost may not entre in to them, and there¦fore prestis be ī perel that teach not the secounde Baptym. For yt suffi∣cyth not to saluaciō of mā to way∣she his body in water of Baptym and suffre his soule to stynk in syn∣ne thorow brekyng of the commaū∣demētis of god, for thus prestis rea∣de in the holy Psalm. Increpasti superbos maledicti qui declinant a mādatis tuis, That is to seye thou blamest the proude they be a cursyd that bow a wey fro thyn hestis. And thus god shall blame proude prestis for they pursewe powre men for the lernynge of the commaundementis the whyche they charge them to ke∣pe in the our of ther. Baptym and all that bere the name of chrysten men shulde crie agenst this errour
For what errour is more vyle in ye syght of god than to byende men to alawe and afterwarde pursue them for the same lawe and thus for drede of euel prestis men dar not kepe chrystis heestis and the ghostly byrth of our mother holy chur¦che is despysed of proude men that knowe not the bond of ther Baptym. Amē. FINIS.
