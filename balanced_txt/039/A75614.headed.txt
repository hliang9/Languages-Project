A SPEECH Made by the Right Honourable the Earl of ARRAN, to the Scots Nobility and Gentry, Met together at the Council Chamber in White-hall, on the Eight of January 1689, about an Address to His Highness the PRINCE of ORANGE, to take upon him the Government of the Kingdom of SCOTLAND. MY LORDS, I Have all the Honour and Deference for the Prince of ORANGE imaginable. I think him a Brave Prince, and that we owe him great Obligations, in Contributing so much for our Delivery from Popery. But while I Pay him those Praises, I cannot Violate my Duty to my Master, I must distinguish between his Popery and his Person, I dislike the one; but have sworn and do owe Allegeance to the other; which makes it impossible for me to sign away that which I cannot forâˆ£bear believing is the KING my Master's Right. For his present absence from us, by being in France, can no more affect our Duty, than his longer absence from us in Scotland had done all this while. MY Lords, The Prince in his Paper desires our Advice, mine is, That we should move his Highness to desire His Majesty to Return and Call a Free Parliament, for the Securing our Religion and property, according to the known Laws of that Kingdom; which in my humble Opinion, will at last be found the Best Way to Heal all our Breaches. Printed in the Year 1689.
