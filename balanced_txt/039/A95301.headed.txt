A true Report of the great Costs and Charges of the five Hospitals in the City of London, under the care of the Lord Mayor, Communalty, and Citizens of London, in the maintenance of their great number of poore this present yeare 1647. as followeth. CHildren kept and maintained at this present, at the Charge of Christs Hospitall in the said House, in divers places of this City and Suburbs, and with sundry Nurses in the Country—597 The names of all which are Registred in the Bookes kept in Christs Hospitall, there to be seene from what Parishes, and by what meanes they have been from time to time admitted. Children put forth Apprentices, discharged, and dead this yeare last past—84 In respect of the troubles of the times, the meanes of the said Hospitall hath very much failed for want of charitable Benevolences, which formerly have been given, and are now ceased, and very few legacies are now given to Hospitals, the Rents and Revenues thereunto belong∣ing, being also very ill paid by the Tenants, who are not able to hold their Leases, by reason of their Quartering and Billetting of Souldiers, and the taking away of their Corne and Cattell from them; And likewise, the said Children are not now permitted to doe their service at Burials as formerly, which was a good helpe towards their reliese: By these and other meanes, the said Hospitall hath not been able to keepe so many Children as formerly they have done. THere hath been cured this yeare last past, at the Charge of S. Bartholomewes Hospitall, of maimed Souldiers, and other diseased persons, to the number of—901 Most whereof being Souldiers, have been relieved with money, and other necessaries at their departure. Buried this yeare after much Charge in their Sicknesse—180 Remaining under Cure at this present, at the charge of the said Hospitall—268 THere hath been Cured at the Charge of S. Thomas Hospitall this yeare last past, of diseased per∣sons, whereof a great number have been Souldiers, who have been relieved with money, and other necessaries at their departure—682 Buried this yeare after much charge in the time of their sicknesse—069 Remaining under Cure, upon the charge of the said Hospitall at this present—215 THere hath been brought to the Hospitall of Bridewell, within the space of one whole yeare last past, of wandring Souldiers, and other vagrant people, to the number of—575 Many whereof have been very chargeable to the said Hospitall, for Apparrell, sick dyet, and Sur∣gery, besides their ordinary dyet, and other provisions and charges expended about them, which could not be avoyded by reason of their necessities; and many of them have been passed into their Countries, with Clothing and Apparrell to cover their nakednesse, which could not be otherwise considering their miseries, nor they thence passed without such charge. And there are now kept and maintained, in Arts and Occupations, and other severall works and labours, at the charge of the said Hospitall, Apprentices and other persons, to the number of—198 The Hospitall of Bethlem is of great Antiquity, use, and necessity, for keeping and curing distra∣cted persons, who are of all other the most miserable, by reason of their wants, both for soul and bo∣dy, and have no sense thereof. The charge thereof is very great, there being kept and maintained with Physick, Dyet, and other reliefe, 52. distracted persons constantly at least, besides the charge of Servants to looke to them, they being most unruly and not able to helpe themselves, and the Rents and Revenues of the said Hospitall being very small, not amounting to two third parts of the yearely charge, and therefore this Hospitall is a fit object of charity, there having been of late by the blessing of God, upon the charge of the said Hospitall, and the care of those that are intrusted with the said distracted people, divers reduced to their former senses.
