Of the Eclipses this Year, 1675. THere will be five Eclipses of the Luminaries this year 1675. viz. three of the Moon, and two of the Sun: those of the Moon will be visible at Edinburgh; but if Clouds hinder not, its certain one of the Solar Eclipses will be visible, as shall in order be proved. The first is an Eclipse of the Moon, the first day of Ja∣nuary, between 7. and 8. at night; it will be a very great Eclpse, continuing 3. hours, 41 min. 58. sec. and the digits Eclipsed are 19. dig. 14′ 38″.
