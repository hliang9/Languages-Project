THE EXAMINATION OF Edw. Fitzharris, Relating to the Popish Plot, TAKEN The Tenth day of March, 1680/1. Published in PRINT BY ORDER Of the HOUSE OF COMMONS, The Twenty fifth of March, 1681. LONDON: Printed for Thomas Fox, at the Sign of the Angel in Westminster-hall. 1681.
THE Examination OF Edward Fitz-Harris, RELATING TO THE Popish-PLOT, Taken the Xth of March, 1680/1. WHO saith, That he was Born in Ireland, and is the Son of Sir Ed∣ward Fitz-Harris; and that he was Bred and is a ROMAN CATHOLICK: That
in One Thousand six hundred sixty-two, he first went out of Ireland and then went into France to learn the language as an Accomplishment, being then of the age of fourteen Years. IN One Thousand six hundred sixty-five, He returned thence through England into Ireland, where He conti∣nued till abou One thousand six hundred sixty-eight when he went to Prague in Order to serve the EMPEROƲR in His War in Hungary, but there then finding a Peace concluded, He came by the way of Flanders into England. AND then Sir George Hamilton being about raising a Regiment of fifteen hundred Foot in Ireland for the French King's Service, This Examinant obtained from Sir George Hamilton a Commission to be Captain of one of the Companies in that Regiment to be raised. Whereupon He went into Ireland, raised the Company, and Con∣ducted them into France, and soon af∣ter His Landing there, He was Re∣formed
and Discharged of His said Command; whereupon He went to Paris, and having but little Money, He lived there difficulty about a year. IN One thousand six hundred seven∣ty-two, going to take his leave of Fa∣ther Gough an ENGLISH PRIEST at Paris, He said to this purpose. YOU are going for ENGLAND, within these two years you will see the CATHOLICK RELIGION Established there as it is in France. THE Examinant asking him how that could be, since the KING was a PROTESTANT; He answered, if the KING would not Comply, there was Order taken and things so laid▪ That he should be TAKEN OFF or KILLED. THAT the DUKE of YORK was a CATHOLICK, and in his Reign there would be no Difficulty of doing it: This Examinant then ask∣ing
him how long the DUKE had been a CATHOLICK; he an∣swered, That the QUEEN MO∣THER had made him so. HE further said that the DE∣CLARATION of INDUL∣GENCE was in order to that end of Introducing the CATHOLICK RELIGION in ENGLAND. AND that to the same end the War was made against HOL∣LAND for that HOLLAND was A NEST OF HERETICKS, and if they were destroyed, the work would be easily done in ENG∣LAND because the English (or ENGLISH PROTESTANTS he said) would then have no assistance from abroad. AND he said that MADAM came over to Dover about this design. THE Examinant coming over a∣bout the end of October, one thousand six hundred seventy-two, about February following, had a Commission to be Lieutenant of Captain Sydenbants
SYDENHAMS Company, in the DƲKE of ALBEMARLES Regiment, which was then raised, being one of the Regiments in the ARMY, which was the Sum∣mer following Muster'd at Black-Heath. And he says, he knew many of the Lieutenant-Collonels, Majors, Captains, and Officers of that Army to be ROMAN-CATHOLICKS. That afterwards the ACT pas∣sing to disable ROMAN-CA∣THOLICKS to bear OF∣FICE, He and others of them were forc'd to quit their Com∣mands. AND says, That the Common Intelligence and Opinion among them was, That that ARMY was raised with Design to bring in and settle the ROMAN-CATHO∣LICK-RELIGION in ENGLAND, for which end
the Invasion of HOLLAND, and the awing of the CITY of LONDON, were fit means. BUT the measures that were thus taken being broken, by means of the PEACE, and by the DUKE of YORK'S, as well as these and other Officers quitting all Com∣mands, and the KING failing in the Expectations they had from him; the ROMAN-CA∣THOLICKS that were enga∣ged in this Councel came to a Re∣solution to DESTROY the KING, as Father Parrey, Con∣fessor to Don Francisco de Melo, the PORTƲGƲESE-EMBAS∣SADOR, told this Examinant in One thousand six hundred seventy three. AND said, if all other means failed, the QUEEN would pro∣cure the Doing of it.
AND He says this Father used this Confidence towards him, because he was well acquainted with him, and used to Confess to him. AND this Father repeated the same Discourse to him in Summer One thousand six hundred seventy Eight, with more assurance; adding then, that the business was now near, and he should soon see it done. ABOUT April, One thousand six hundred seventy nine, Marquess Montecuculi, ENVOY from the DUKE of MODENA, af∣ter having sworn him to secrecy, told him, That if he would undertake THE KILLING THE KING, either in his own Person, or by any other, that he should have TEN THOUSAND POUNDS; which he refusing, the Marquess
said, If you will not, The DUTCHESS OF MAZARINE understands poysoning, as well as her Sister; and a little Vial, when the KING comes there, will do it. AND this Examinant had a great acquaintance with the said Marquess, having first met him se∣veral times at the DUTCHESS of YORKS Chappel, and afterwards, Let him a House, and sold him the Furniture therein, and has very often eaten, drank, and walk'd with him. AND the Marquess at the same time told him, that upon KILLING THE KING the ARMY in FLANDERS and parts adjacent to FRANCE, was to come over into ENGLAND, to destroy the PRO∣TESTANT PARTY, and that money was levying in ITALY, to recruit and sup∣ply Forces in the place of those that should so come over into ENGLAND.
AND That after that time there should be no more PAR∣LIAMENTS in ENG∣LAND; and that the DƲKE of YORK was privy to all these De∣signs. That about April, One thousand six hundred and eighty, he met Kelley the Priest at Calais, who there in discourse with him owned, that he was one of the persons concerned in the Murder of Sir EDMƲND BƲRY-GODFREY, and that the same was done much in the man∣ner as PRANCE had rela∣ted it. This Examinant hath known
Kelley about twelve years, in part of which time he has had intimate Conversation with him, and hath sometimes confessed to him, That he hath been acquainted six or seven years with Monsieur DE PƲY, a Servant to the Duke of York; and that soon after the Murder of Sir Edmund Bury-Godfrey, this De PƲY told this Examinant, that that Murder was consulted at Wind∣sor. And about the same time said, that the DƲKE was very desi∣rous to come to the CROWN, for that the KING was uncer∣tain, and did not keep touch with them. And that DE PƲY
said, there was a necessity of taking OFF the KING, and that it would be soon done. That the DƲKE of YORK having an Estate in Ireland, a part of which was this Examinants Fa∣thers, and his Examinant, being acquainted with Father Bedingfield, asked him, how he could give Ab∣solution to the DƲKE, till he had made Restitution. The Fa∣ther said, that every Penitent was supposed to know his own sins, and to make them known to his Con∣fessor. To which this Examinant replying with some warmth▪ But since you know it, you ought to take no∣tice thereof. The Father answer∣ed,
Be not angry, for ere it be long you may be in a better condition. MARCH One thousand six hundred seventy nine eighty, he went to Paris to compound a Debt he owed there; staying there about eight days, where meeting Father Patrick (who well knew this Exa∣minant's Father and Friends, and this Examinant) talking of a Rup∣ture that might be between England and France, he said the French in∣tended in such case to send Mareshal BELFONDS into Ireland with an Army of Ten thousand Foot and Two thousand Horse, with Arms and Ammunition for 30000 Men more to be raised in Ire-
IRELAND, and the Father promised this Examinant a Re∣giment of the Men so to be Rai∣sed, and Armed in IRELAND, and the Design was to restore that Kingdom to its former Owners, subject to the FRENCH. HE also desired him to send him all the LIBELS that came out in LONDON; and said, That LIBELLING the KING and the GOVERN∣MENT, was a thing necessary to be done, in order to Distaste the KING, and make him Afraid and Jealous of his Peo∣ple. THAT he knew Mr. Everard at PARIS, in One thousand six hundred sixty five, and hath since continued and encreased his Acquaintance with him; that the Opinion of Father Patrick, was an Encouragement to him to
to Correspond and Concur with Mr. Everard, as to the LIBEL lately written by Mr. Everard. Capt. 10 Martii, 1680/1. coram ROB. CLAYTON, GEO. TREBY. FINIS.
