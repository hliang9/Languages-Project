The Myrrour or Glasse of Christes Passi∣on, ❧ ❧ ❧ HH
The Preface. ¶To the honorable lorde Husey. My lorde / accordyngly vnto your desyre: I haue trāslated your boke & put it into our na¦tyue & mother tongue as my simple wit and po¦wer lernyng wold suffer me, And though it be nat so well done as (I surely knowe) many o∣ther myght & can haue done it, if it wolde haue pleased your lordship to haue deyred thē, and if also it wold haue lyked them to haue taken that labour: yet I trust I haue so done, that it may be comforth to the readers & hea¦rers / or at the leste: I haue gyuen occasion to ordre to amend and performe that I rudely and barbarously, set forward. Surely (my lorde) the chyefe cause of this my labour was: for that I thought this boke shulde be moche profytable to the readers and edefyeng to all that wolde diligently hear it, And to say the treuth: I know no thynge more comfortable to man, For amonges all the exercy∣ses that helpe the spirite to obteyne the loue of god / and specially to hym yt wolde begyn & vse a spiritual lyfe: no thynge is thought always more frutful, thā the continnal meditacion of the passion of our lorde god Iesus Christ, for the exercyses of all other spiri∣tuall meditacions may be reduced and brought vnto this. As by an example, If a man desyre to bewayll and weape for his vices and synnes for his vnkyndnes and vilenes / if he couit to purge & amend his negligence & defautes: he shall fynde none more vehe∣ment and redy meane to pricke hym forwarde to his intent: than to remembre the most innocēt death and passion of his redeamer: that is to consyder what bitter paynes he suffred for man: to spare and kepe man from payne eternall wherafter Iustice he shulde haue rather dampned man for his synnes, And here man may see both the Iustice and also the mercy of god. Man may cōsyder in hym selfe the great mercy of god: in that god wold forgyue and {per}¦don hym of his synnes. He may also perceiue the iustice of god: in his owne synnes, whiche god dyd correcte & punysshe accordyng to iustice in hym selfe, bycause he wold nat suffre thē vnpunished, And thus in this meditacion man may fynde how to weape and mourne for his synnes: for the which the son of god was bet / woū¦dyd and crucified, and all that god suffred: to cure man of his syn¦nes & kepe hym from eternall payne. Here may also man bewayle
his owne vnkyndnes, consyderyng how vnkyndly he rendreth to so faythfull a louer: so many yuell dedes contrary to goddes plea¦sure, and also dayly contemptes and despysynges: for his tendre loue and kyndnes and for his manyfolde gyftes which man day∣ly receyueth of hym. Morouer this cōtemplacion of the death of Christ indureth man both to hope and to fear, wherby he may be releaued of two temptacyons, or if the enormitie of his synnes moue any man to dispaire: he hathe here in this exercise wherby to put away his synnes, and to make satisfactiō for them, he hath here wherof to redeme hīselfe yt is ye blode & deth of his lorde god, & therfore he nede nat to feare his synnes, if he so ordre hym selfe yt he dye with Christ, dye (I say) from synne and ryse in a new lyfe. And on the other parte, it man be vexed by presumpcion or vayne lyghtnes and myrth without the fear of god: he hath here how to abate his vayne myrth, cōsyderyng how that heuē was shyt from the moste holy frendes of god by many yeres ye aboue .iiii. thou∣sand yeres, and how that the glory of god was denyed to mā or at the least differred, by so many yeres vnto the tyme that our lorde and sauiour Iesus whiche neuer dyd synne: suffred death for our synne, so that no mā may come to that glory but by payne, & thus shall mannes vayne myrth be put downe. If peraduenture man be dull and slouthfull to all goodnes: where shall he haue a more spedy remedy to pricke forwarde his dulnes: than to cōsydre how his lorde god moste pure & innocent man, suffred so greuouse pay¦nes for hym. Some man wold peraduenture exercise him selfe in his owne knowlege and so to come to meknes. But I pray you where shall he haue a better occasion therunto, thā to ponder and way the difformite and great difference of his owne study and la¦bour and shortly the ordre of his hole lyfe: and of the labour & lyfe of Iesus Christ, that is, remembre man howe cōtrarie thy lyfe is to his wyl & p̄ceptes / how vnlike to his vertues / how farre frō his ensāples, remēbre mā how frayle thou art & redy to fal, how vnsta¦ble in all thy good purposes, how vnredy or rather loth to folowe thy lorde, howe vnapte to all goodnes, As euery man may dayly se in hym selfe. Forthermore, if mā wold be enflamed to loue god where may he haue better help than by this exercise, for if it be na∣tural to rendre loue for loue, and the loue of god was neuer more openly shewed to man than in his redemption, that is in the pas∣sion and death of our redeamer Christ Iesus: it is than manifest
that by this remembraunce of his passion: a man is moste strong¦ly excited and moued to loue god. And if man desyre to be pric∣ked forward in that loue: let hym remembre the benefites of god which be as signes & tokens of his loue, And these benefites most euidently appere in his passion, as ye shall more clerely se in this boke. At last, if man desyre that all his lyfe be continuall and per¦petuall prayer / and that he wold haue his herte euer lyfted vp to god, and his deuotion or feruour euer renewed: he shal neuer get it more easly than by the remembraunce of the lyfe and passion of his lorde god, for there he may haue in euery worde / acte / behaui¦our and paine that Christ spake / dyd / vsed / and suffred: how to be compuncte and sory in hert / & how to be conforted in spirite. For in the consyderation of them, now he may wepe by compassion, Now by gyuyng thankes: he may haue swete affections, Nowe he may desyre to be confourmed vnto hym, and to his wyl, Now he may labour and wysshe to be holly transfourmed into hym. Thus may man go from one exercise vnto an other to auoyde te∣diousnes / and so euer to be ī prayer. And shortly to cōclude, there is no kynde of spirituall exercise: but that it may be founde in the lyfe & passion of Christ, or els by moste pleantuouse fruyte it may be reduced and applied to it. And this shall better appere in the fyrst parte of this boke the thyrde {per}tycle. Nowe my lorde I haue shewed what was the pryncypall cause mouyng me to accōplysh your desyre / and if I may perceyue that ye or ony other take pro∣fyt therby: I shall gyue prayses to god from whom all goodnes commeth / and I beseache iour lorship to pray with me that moch profyt and comforth myght come to them that shal rede this boke and folowe the exercices therof. And thus I cō∣mende you and all youres to the passion of our lorde. From Syon the .vi. day of Decembre. 1533. ¶your dayly oratour Iohan Fewterer. ✚ ❧ ❧ ❧
The Prologue. ☞ Inspice et fac secundum exemplar quod tibi mon∣stratum est in monte. Exodi. 25. D. BEholde and worke accordyngly to the examplar that is shewed vnto the ī the moun, Christ althoughe oftymes in scripture be com∣pared to a mount or so called for the excellency of his moste hyghe perfection: yet moste speci∣ally in that he was exalted on the crosse in the mount of Caluary, he may be called a mount, or the excellēt merit of his moste bitter and sa∣crate passion. In this mount (that is in Christ crucified) is this day (that is by all the tyme of our lyfe) shewed vnto vs a glasse or an examplar, whome we shuld nat onely beholde: but also with moste deligence folowe his steppes / for it is nat sufficient to a chri¦stian to beholde Christ crucified. For so dyd the Iues and also the gentyls his crucifiers, But it is required of a Christian yt he lyue and worke accordyngly to the exāplar shewed to hym in ye mount that is Christe crucified. And that is the intent of our fyrst wor∣des spoken to euery faythful person. Beholde and worke accor∣dyngly to the example of Christe crucified. Behode (I say) hym incorporatyng or depely knittyng his paynfull passion vnto thy hert by inward compassion, And worke accordyngly vnto his ex¦ample, vnfaynedly folowyng hym. For so saynt Petre teachethe vs sayng,1. Pe. 2. D. Christus passus est pro nobis. Christ suffred for vs. This is the fyrst thyng, that we shulde diligently beholde with the in∣warde ey of our soule: Christ crucified. And it foloweth. Nobis re¦linquens exemplum vt sequamur vestigia eius, Leuyng to vs an ex∣ample that we myght folowe his steppes, In ordryng our lyfe ac¦cordyngly to his wyll and example, And this is the second thyng belongyng to a christian, vnfaynedly and truely to folowe his sa∣uiours example. And in these two thynges shall stande the hole sūme of our purpose and of this treatise, which be necessary to be ofte remembred vnto the Christian. For if the lyues passions of holy sayntes and martyrs be recounted to man, to induce hym into deuotion of herte, to contricion for his synnes, to the loue of god / despisyng of the world and patient sufferance or bearyng of tribulations and paynes: how moche more than shuld the pas∣sion of Christ be remembred and preached / whiche is moste holy of al sayntes ye the sanctifier, of al sayntes, lorde and god ouer al,
the iudge of quicke, & the resurrection or reasex of the deed? This passion (I say) shuld be remembred, that men hearyng it myght knowe how moche god the father hated synne, for the destruction wherof: he wold haue the preciouse blode of his moste deare belo¦ued onely son shed vpon the erthe with moste greuouse tormentes and woundes, and also that man myght knowe, how moche he lo¦ued mankynde, for whose saluacion he wold gyue his only sonne to so cruell tormentes & paynfull death. Thyrdly that we should knowe how preciouse and deare a thyng is the kyngdom of heuen which he wold nat open and gyue vnto mankynd but by the pre∣ciouse blode and deth of his naturall sonne Iesu Christe. And fourthly to declare vnto vs howe moche he soueth and reioyceth in the penaunce of man for the declaration and example wherof, he wold his deare byloued sonne to be nayled fast vnto the crosse and spred abrode on ye same as a boke open wherin we myght rede and lerne howe to do penaunce. What other thyng do signifie vn¦to vs, his teares or wepyng / his sorow / his woundes / his armes spred abrode / and his moste swete and godly wordes: but mociōs and callynges vnto penaunce He hath called vs vnto penaūce by his worde / by his Euangely / and moste of all by his holy lyfe and example. Therfore behold and loke vpon this examplar & glasse loke vpon the face of thy sauiour Christ / and worke accordyngly to the exemplar that is shewed / to the in the mount of Caluarye.Psal. 83. And if this spectacle or glasse ought to be beholden at all tymes: moche more than it shuld be cōsydered this tyme whā the churche remembreth the passion of our sauiour Christe that by the consy∣deryng therof: our soule myght be excited & moued to gyue than∣kes to god for it / and also to haue cōpassion in our soule of Christ crucified. For as almyghty god sayth by his prophet Moises. Anima que non fuerit afflicta die hac:Leui. 23. E. peribit de populo suo. That soule or {per}son which wyl nat take vpō hym some payne / affliction or compassion this day or tyme of the passion of our lorde: shal pe¦ryshe from his people / that is, shall nat be accompted or taken for a christian. Therfore let vs say in signe and token of compassion that whiche saynt Bernard sayd in his mournyng. Quis dabit ca∣piti meo aquam.In lib. de la mentatione virginis. &c. Who shall graūt or gyue water vnto me heade or the fountayne and well of teares vnto myne yen that I myght wepe both day and nyght vnto the tyme my lord appere vnto his seruaūt and comfort hym eyther slepyng or wakyng. O ye swete teares / by whom commeth the plentuouse ryuers of graces. O ye deuote teares the aboundaunt fountayne of my helth / come into
my hert / flowe out of myne yen / fall vpon my chekes / & make my mournyng bitter. Also in an other place saynt Bernard mouethe vs to the beholdyng of this exāplar / our sauiour crusified: saynge in the person of Christ. O thou mā beholde what I suffred for the Se the crosse on the whiche for thy loue I dyed, Beholde the nay¦les wherwith my handes and my fete ware persed and fasened to the crosse for thy synne, Is this no sorowe and payne that I suffe¦red for the? And thoughe this outward sorowe & payne be moche greuouse: yet moche more paynfull it is to me inwardly / to se the so vnkynde, for whom I suffred all these greuouse tormentes and paynes. Wherfore o thou christiā behold Christ crucified & gyue hym thankes for his kyndnes, lesse {per}aduenture thou mayste hear the rebuke that was spoken vnto .ix. leprose cured by our sauiour Iesu,Luc. 17. D. to whose rebuke he sayd. Nonne decem mundati sunt et nouē vbi sunt, Was there nat .x. persons cured, and but one (that was a straūger) yt gyueth thākes for his benefyt receyued, wher be ye o∣ther .ix. Behold I say Christe crucified & remēbre his kindnes ac∣cordyng to ye coūcell of ye wyse mā sayng.Eccl. 29. C. Gratiam fide iussoris tui ne obliuiscaris dedit enim pro te animam suam. Forget nat ye kynd∣nes of thy suerte or frende for he hathe gyuen his lyfe for the / this shulde be diligently remembred. ¶Here endeth the prologue. ¶The diuision of this treatisse or mirrour.

The Myrrour of Christes passion. ¶Of the first perticle that is an exortation / mouyng men vnto the meditation of the passion of Christe. The Fyrst Chapitre. OYe people that walke and wander in va¦nitees,Bonue∣tura in S∣mulo amo∣ris in prin∣cipio. come hether and beholde in this Glasse / Christ crucified / & inwardly consider the greate charite of god to you. And on the other parte be∣hold your owne blyndnes and malyce towardes hym. Sith it hath pleased the sonne of god to be ioyned vnto the nature of man / and neuer to be departed frome it: howe moche more gladly shuld ye desyre that your soule shulde be vnite & ioyned vnto hym vnseperably. And sith the sonne of god wold through the great feruoure of his cha∣rite / ioyne to his godheed in one persone / so vyle asshes and dust as the nature of man is. Howe moche more desirous shulde eche one of you be / to open your hert and dilate it or sprede it abrode to receyue hym in to it? What folysshenes or rather madnes is it / that ye dispisynge or lytell regardynge this inestimable charite / wyl rather open your herte vnto the filthy pleasures of the body / or vanytes of the worlde / and to be ioyned vnto them by loue / ra∣ther than to god. The sonne of god toke nat a mortal body to the intent yt man shulde loue bodily or carnall pleasures: but that as Christ hauyng a mortall body / dyd by cōtinual penaunce subdue his body / cōtempne all carnall worldly pleasures: and was euer ioyned to god by loue: so in lyke maner shuld mortal man morti∣fye his body by continuall penaunce dispise all vayne pleasures / and euer erecte or lyfte vp his soule to god and heuenly thynges. O the meruaylous blyndnes of man made of two substaunces / that is the soule and the body / and all thoughe the soule without comparison be moche more noble than the body: yet he wyl spend and occupy all his tyme in a maner aboute the prouisyon of his body / or in suche thynges as the flesshe desireth / and in nothynge regarde his soule / as yf he had none / or that it were of no value. For he wyll neyther fede nor norysshe it / nor yet laboure to quiete or rest it in the loue of god / thoughe he myght so do with moche more ease / swetnes and also pleasure without comparison / than to content and saciat the body. For god is prest and redy to euery man: ye he offereth hym selfe to man / yf man he wyl receyue hym. Ecce sto ad ostium et pulso. &c.Apo. 3. D. Behold (he sayth) I stande at thy dore (that is thy herte or soule) and knocke yf any person wyl here
my voyce / and open the dore of his soule vnto me: I shall entre therin and suppe with hym / and he with me. Se thou vnkynde man / howe our lorde offereth hymselfe vnto the / and requyreth none other pryce of the / but the deth of his sonne with thyne obe∣dient herte: therfore gladly receyue hym to thy spirituall cōforte. All corporall and temporall thynges fle frome man / and forsake hym / and thoughe with great study / anguysshe / and payne / he la∣bour to get and kepe them: yet he shal neuer haue ye ful possession of them to his quietnes / excepte he wolde say / that he hath the ful possession of them: the whiche holly and fully contempneth and dispiseth them all: for that person is saciate and contente with the wante of them. But wyll ye se a more meruaylous blyndnes of this wretched man. The soule of man which is made to thymage of god / and the whiche shall neuer be saciate and content but on∣ly with god: that same soule / nat constrayned (though partely en∣clyned and moued by the flesshe) wylfully subdeweth her selfe vn∣to the flesshe redy to fulfyl the vayne pleasures and desyres of the flesshe. But she cōtempneth or dispiseth to subdue her self to god / though she be continually moued therunto by dayly exhortatyon or preachynge / continuall receyuynge of his benefytes and gra∣ces and also by inwarde inspirations. Ye more ouer she wyll nat do the wyl of god in his owne gyftes that he gyueth to her. True¦ly yf the soule were nat worse or more bestial than any brut beste / she wolde loue god aboue all thynges / vnto whose ymage she is made. And so: lytell or nothynge regarde all creatures in compa∣rison of god. Wherfore thou soule / yf thou wylt loue the flesshe or the body / loue none other but the flesshe and the body of Christe / whiche was offered for the and for the helth of mankynde / on the auter of the crosse. Therfore dayly remembre in thy herte his pas∣sion. For it so remembred in the soule of man: is continually of∣fered and presented to the syght of the father omnipotent for our consolation and comforte.A naturall example. It is comenly sayd that if any man kyl or slee another man: yf that mansleer come afterwarde in the pre∣sence of that deed corps or body so that he se it: it wyl incontinent blede / or voyde at the wounde fresshe blode. So yf we wolde be∣holde with the deuoute eyen of our soule the blode and passion of Christe / whom we haue slayne or were the occasyon of his deth / nat onely by our original synne / but also by our manyfolde actu∣all synnes: we shuld fele or perceyue by spiritual grace of deuoti∣on in our soules / howe that by our compassion of his passion / his blode flowethe plentuously out of his body / and is offered and
presented vnto his father for our saluacion and sanctification. For yf the nayles that persed his handes and feet were sanctified and called holy by the tochyng of his blessed mēbres / how moche more then shulde our reasonable thoughtes whiche cleue fast to Christe crucifyed by continual or ofte remembraunce of his pas∣sion be called holy. O most delectable passion. O most meruay∣lous deth. Meruaylous? Ye what may be more meruaylous / for this deth doth gyue life / it cureth our wound{is} / it maketh blode whyte / that is / it purifieth and clenseth our soule from the blode of synne. Great bitternes and sorowe / is ofte times tourned to moche swetenes & pleasure. The openyng of the syde of Christ / ioyneth his herte to our herte. The sonne hyd frome vs by the clowdes / whan the clowdes be gone and paste: it shineth more clerely. The fyre quenched: is shortlyer or soner kyndeled & ma∣keth the greater flame. The ignominious and shamfull deth of Christe: glorifieth both hym and vs. Christe thristyng vpon the crosse doth inebriate and saciate vs with the drynke and liquore of grace. Christe hangyng naked on the crosse: clotheth ye rygh∣tuous persones with the garmentes of vertue. His handes nay∣led to the crosse: dothe vnknytte or loose oure handes / his feete nayled dothe make vs ronne to vertue. Christe yeldynge his spyryte in to the handes of his father: dothe inspyre and gyue lyfe of grace. And he also spred abrode vpon the crosse: doth call vs to heuenly thinges. O the wonderfull passyon of Christe / the whiche doth alyenate and chaunge the herte and mynde of hym that hath remembraunce and compassion of it. For it nat on∣ly maketh hym angelical: but also diuine and godly. For he that cōtinueth by meditation in the tormentes and passion of Christ: seeth nat hym selfe / bycause he alwayes and onely beholdeth his sauiour Christe crucified. This person wolde bere the crosse of Christe with hym / and he also bereth in his herte hym: which sus∣teynethe both heuen and erthe / with whome he may easely sus∣teyne and beare all heuy burdens and paynes. This persone al∣so that thus continueth in the mediation of Christe crucifyed / wolde be crowned with thornes with Christe and for Christe / and he is crowned with the sure hope and truste of the crowne of glory. He wolde hynge naked on the crosse with Christe / and so shake for colde / and he is heated in his soule with the feruent fyre of loue. He wolde taste of the bitter and sharpe vynacre and gall with Christe / and he drynkethe the wyne of vnspeakable swetenes. He wolde be mocked and scorned withe Christe on
the crosse / and he is honoured of aungelles. He wolde be dispy∣sed and forsaken with Christe / and our lady hath chosen hym to her sonne. He wolde be heuy with Christe / and he is conforted. He wolde be tormented and scourged with Christe / and he is re∣lyued with great ioy & gladnes. He wold hynge with Christe on the crosse / and Christe most swetely doth embrace and halse hym. He wolde be pale in face and inclyne his heed downe for feblenes with Christe / and Christe cōfortably lyftynge vp his heed / doth most swetly kysse hym. And therfore saynt Barnarde sayth: O good Iesu we beleue / and so it is / that who so bereth thy crosse / he bereth thy glory. And he that bereth thy glory / he bereth the. And hym yt bereth the / thou bereth vpon thy sholdre. Thy sholdre is stronge and very hygh / for it recheth vnto the fete of the father in heuen aboue all the orders of aungels / aboue all principates / potestates / & vertues. Thither thou reducest or bryngest agayne the wanderynge shepe that dyd erre from the flocke / that is man∣kynde / the whiche by his synne was put out of Paradyse. Good lorde, I may compasse, go about, and serche both heauen and erth / the see, and the lande / & no where shal I fynde the but in the crosse. There thou slepest / there thou fedest / there thou restest in the hete of the day. In this crosse my soule is lyfted vp from the erth / and there it gathereth the swete apples vpon the tree of lyfe. In this crosse the soule cleuynge fast to her lorde god / doth swetely synge and say:Psal. 3. Susceptor meus es tu, gloria mea, et exaltans caput meum. Thou arte my defēdour my glory / and thou exalteth vp my heed: that is my soule from the consideration of all vayne & transitory thynges / vnto the meditacion of thyn vnspeakable goodnes she∣wed vnto man vpon the crosse. O most amyable deth. O moste delectable deth of the most noble body of our lorde Iesu Christe / from whome I wolde neuer be seperate / but in hym to make thre tabernacles / one in his handes / another in his fete / and the thirde in the woūde of his syde. There I wyll rest and slepe / eate and drynke / rede and pray / and there I wyll perfourme all my besy∣nes that I haue to do. There I shall speake vnto his herte / and optayne of hym what so euer is nedeful for me. Thus doynge) I may folow ye steppes of his most swete mother Marie / whose soule: ye swerde of sorowe dyd thyrle & perse at the deth of her sone. If I be thus woūded with Christe / I may from hensforth suerly speke to her & moue her in al my necessites / and she wyl nat denye me / bycause she seeth me crucified with her sonne Christe. ¶Here foloweth an example of this exhortation.
WE may take an example of this exhortation to re∣mēbre the passion of Christ (in the boke called:Libro. xxxi. Spe∣culum hystoriale Vincentij) of certayne singuler per∣sones whiche had this special grace.Capi. x. et xiiii. We rede there that in the partes of the Dioces called Leodin̄: a no¦ble & deuout preest called: Iacobus de Vitriaco / the whiche after∣warde was the bysshop of Tusculane and cardinall / and this ho∣ly man se there diuerse women of so meruaylous affection and so feruent in the loue of god / through the continuall remēbraunce of the passion of Christe / that by that feruent loue and desyre / they were so seke that by many yeres they coulde nat ryse out of theyr beddes but very seldome / hauynge none other cause of sekenes or disease but onely the said feruent loue. For their hertes (by ye con∣tinuall remembraunce of the infinite charite of god shewed in the passion of Christe) were so relented by that meditation / that the more that they were cōforted in soule / the more seke & weyke they were in theyr bodyes: saynge & cryeng in herte / though for shame they durst nat speke in wordes / the sayng of the spouse in the can∣ticles:Canti. 1. A. Fulcite me floribus, stipate me malis, quia amore langueo. Comforte me with flowres / strength me with apples or other fru¦tes / for I am seke or languysshe for loue. And in some of these wo¦men (a meruaylous thyng) it myght be perceyued sensibly / howe that whan theyr soule in a maner melted throughe the vehemence of loue / theyr chekes and the coloure of them sensibly fayded and fel away. In other of them throughe the swete consolations that they receyued in theyr soules / there redoūded in to their mouthes a pleasaunt taste / as if it had ben of hony or other swete meat / and that they felte sensibly. And so it retresshed them both corporally and spiritually / and this taste also moued them to swete teares / and preserued or kepte theyr hertes in deuotion. Some of them also receyued so great grace of wepynge in deuotion / that as ofte as god was in theyr herte by remembraunce of his goodnes / so ofte the ryuers of teares flowed from theyr eyen by inward deuo∣tion / so that the steppes or pryntes of the teares / dyd afterwarde appere in theyr chekes thorough the custome of wepynge. And here note a meruaylous thyng / that the wepyng or teares dyd nat hurt their brayne or heed / as it doth comenly in al other persones / but rather in them it comforted theyr myndes / with a full & plen∣tuous deuotion. It made swete or pleasaūt theyr spirites with a swete vnction of grace. It meruaylously refresshed their bodyes / and it gladded al ye hole cōgregation of ye seruaūtes of god there.
¶More ouer we rede in the same boke of an holy and deuoute woman called Maria de Ogines / of whome the forsayde mayster Iacobus de Vitriaco / beynge in great feruoure of deuotion cryed with a lowde voyce vnto almyghty god sayng:Vbi supra. O lord god thou arte very good to them that trusteth in the / thou arte faythfull to thy seruauntes that truste and abyde thy promisses.Capi. xviii. Thy hand mayde good lord hath dispised and forsaken for thy loue / thonour of the worlde with all the pleasures of the same / and thou accor∣dyngly vnto thy promisse in scripture hath rendred and gyuen to her an hundreth tymes more in this worlde / and also euerlastyng lyfe in the kyngdome of glorye.Mt. 19. D. The fyrst fruites or begynnynge of her loue to the / was the remembraunce of thy crosse / passion / and deth. For on a certayne day when she (preuented with thy grace and mercyfully visited by the) considered the great benefi∣tes / whiche thou of thyn vnspeakable goodnes shewed vnto man kynde in workynge our redemption / she founde or opteyned so great grace of compunction / and suche abundaunce or copye of teares in thy crosse and passion / that we myght haue traced or fo∣lowed her thorowe the churche by her teares that fel on ye groūde from her. And of a longe tyme after that she had this swete visi∣tation and grace of teares / she myght neyther see nor beholde the ymage of the crucifix / nor yet speke or here other speke of the passi¦on of Christe / but forthwith she fel in swowne. Wherfore that she might somwhat tempre and abate that great passion and sorowe / and restrayne thaboundaunce of her wepynge, she lefte the con∣sideration of thumanite or manheed of Christe, and tourned her mynde holly to the meditation of the maiestye) and godheed of Christe / that in his eternitye and inpassibilytye she myght fynde some consolation and comforth. But where she thought and la∣boured to haue stopped and restrayned the floode of her teares / there rose and sprang maruailously greater abundaūce of teares. For when she considered of what glorie and dignitie he was that wolde suffer so vyle and shamfull deth for our redemption / then her sorowe was renewed in her / and her soule so relented for deuout compūction / that moche more plentye of teares departed from her / and moche more ye may see in the sayde boke / if it please you. ✚ ¶A prayer.
O Lorde Iesu Christ the sonne of the liuynge god, for thyn vnspeakable pitye / and the moste excellent lyfe of the moste holy mother Marie / and for the merites of saynt Francisce / and of al thy sayntes / graunt (we beseche the) vnto vs most wretched synners vnwor∣thy any of thy benefites / that we myght loue the alone / and euer be burnynge or feruente in thy loue / and that we might continu∣ally magnifie the werke of our redemption / that we myght euer desyre thy honour / and dayly bere and remembre in our herte the benefyte of thy passion / that we myght knowe and consydre our miserye / and continually desire to be dispised aud rebuked for thy loue / so that nothynge shulde comforth vs and abide in our hert{is} / but thy deth and passion / and nothynge displease or trouble vs / but our owne synne and wretchednes Amen. ¶Of the meane and maner of the remembraunce of the passion of Christe. The second particle. HOwe I shall shewe vnto yowe howe we shulde vse and exercise our self in the passion of Christe. In the whiche vii. tymes in the day at the leeste: euery christiane shuld exercise hym selfe accordyngly to the sentence or mynde of saynt Barnard sayng: The cōtinual or dayly lesson of a christi ane / shulde be the remembraunce of the passion of Christe. For there is nothynge that so moche kyndeleth the hert of man / as the manheed of Christ / and the ofte and deuout remembraunce of his passion. Howe this may be / we shall perceyue it in this maner, That is this / who so euer wyll {pro}fite in the meditation of Christ{is} passion / let hym ordre hym selfe / as if Christe were put to all the paynes of his deth and passion in his presence / and so let hym con¦sidre depely / diligētly and with deliberation al the poyntes of his passion / therunto fixe his hole mynde perseuerantly leuynge and settynge a parte all other cures and busines / with drawinge hym selfe with as great diligēce as he can from all superfluouse meat{is} and drynkes / and from all dilycates / from al fyne garmentes and softe beddes / from all vayne sportes & lyghtnes / from vayne ioy / and from all vayne and ydle speche. For all these and suche other lyke ben clene contrarie to the frutefull remēbraunce of Christes passion / as we shall she we more clerly herafter. And therfore it is necessarie that if a man wyll profyt herein / that he thynke hym selfe as yf he were presente at the passyon of Christe / and so ordre and behaue hym self in his speche / in his sight / in his sorowyng / and in al his other outwarde actes / as if he sawe before his face /
Christe hyngynge on the crosse. If a man thus order hym selfe Christe crucifyed shalbe spiritually with hym and in his presence as he thynketh in his owne mynde / and so shall gladly behold his dedes and thoughtes / and also gratiously accepte his vowes and promysses. But take hede that this remembraunce be nat soone lost and shortly put away / specially whan deuotion and tyme wyl serue with conuenient oportunitye / and se that this remēbraunce be with a faythful and herty maner and with a mournyng cōpas∣sion. For suerly yf this most swete and pleasaunt tree of the crosse be nat affectuously & louyngly chewed with the teethe of feruent deuotion: the sauour therof (though in it selfe it be very delici∣ous) shal neuer moue the. And if thou can nat wepe with Chryst that wepte for the / and sorowe with hym / that sorowed for the / at the leest thou ought to ioy in hym and to render thankes to hym with a deuout herte for his manifold benefytes gyuen to the with¦out any thyng deseruynge. And if thou felest thy selfe noder mo∣ued vnto compassion / nor yet to gyue thankes with a feruent de∣syre vnto god for his benefites / but rather depressed with an hard herte in the sayd remēbraunce / neuer the lesse with that same hard herte ronne vnto the holsome remembraunce of Christes passion and gyue suche thankes to god as thou may for that tyme. And that which thou can nat haue nor felyst nat in thy selfe / committe in to the handes of his most mercifull goodnes. And if yet thou continue in thy stubbernes and harde herte / for perauenture thy herte is tourned in to the hardnes of a Dyamant / whiche can ne∣uer be broken but with the hote blode of a gote / as Plinius sayth in his naturall historie:Lib. xxxvii. Cap. iiii. here I offer & shewe vnto the the greate copie and plentie of blode of the gote and also of a lambe inconta¦minate / vnspotted or vndefyled Iesu Christe / which is very hote and burnynge with an incomparable feruent loue and charitye / whiche thorough the strength of his heet / hath broken and dissol∣ued that harde and Dyamant wall of enmitie / which the synne of our fyrst parentes and also our actuall synnes hath made and put bytwyxte god and man. Wasshe or drowne thy selfe in the copi∣ouse blode of this gote and lambe / O thou Adamant herte / and lye in it that thou may be made warme / & thou so heated or made warme / may be molifyed or made softe / and so molified: may shed plentiously ryuers of teares.Num̄. xx. B Moyses smote twyse on the stone and brought suche plentye of water / so smyte thy harde stony hert twyse that is with the inwarde hertye remembraunce of Christe passyon / and withe the outwarde laboure of thy bodye / as ex∣exercysynge
thy selfe in lyftynge vp thy handes or thy syght / vnto the crucifixe in ofte knockynge on thy breste / in deuoute ge∣nuflexions / knelynges / or peyne takynges / or in exercysyng thy self in takyng disciplines or scurgyng{is} / or in other lyke outwarde exercise / and so cōtinue vnto thou haue goten the grace of teares. Wherby thy reasonable soule shal drynke the waters of deuotion. And thy sensual or bestly bodye by thexperiēce therof shalbe hum∣bled and subdued vnto the reasonable soule. ¶The thirde particle, howe we shulde fele in our selfe the passion of Christ / and this {per}ticle is deuided in to .v. cha¦pitres / firste is howe we shulde fele the passion of Christe in our vnderstandynge and reason. SAynt Poule sayth:Phili. 2. A. Hoc sentite invobis quod et in Christo Iesu. Fele and perceiue in your selfe that Christ Iesu elt / that ye myght sucke & drawe watres frome the fountayns of our sauiour. For who so euer exercise them selfe fayth∣fully in this passion / they shal sucke & drawe from thens al maner of graces / as we said afore.In the fyrst particle. For suerly this exercise hath his di∣uers degrees / wherby we may come to the perfeccion of all sanc∣titye or holynes. Wherfore we ought (accordyngly to thadmoni∣cion of saint Poule) fele in our selfe ye passion of Christ. And that v. maner of wise. First in our vnderstandyng / secōdly in our wyl / loue and affection / thirdly in our actes and operation / fourtly in our pouerty and necessityes / fyftly in our reprouynges or dis∣pisinges. First I say we shuld fele the passion of Christe in our vnderstandyng or reason / so that we dilygenly and with attenci∣on fourme our thoughtes accordyngly vnto the paynes & passion of Christe. Hereunto we be moued by the wordes of the prophet sayng in the person of Christe crucified:Tren̄. 1. D. O vos omnes qui transi∣tis per viam attendite et videte si est dolor sicut dolor meus. O all ye that passe thorough the way of this worlde: take hede (that is: thynke with a diligēt & attent mynde) and depely cōsider if there be any sorowe lyke vnto my sorowe. And this is done truely and faythfully / when the passion of Christ is remēbred rather with an attent mynde & cogitation / than with deuotion. For cogitation hath his signification & name of abidyng / tarieng / or ell{is} cōstray∣nynge after some doctours. For asmoche as in such cogitatyons whan reason & vnderstādyng hath nat that gyft & grace of know∣lege that it wolde haue / it is cōstrayned to abyde / tary & reuolue it in his cogitation / vnto the tyme yt he hath gotē some perceyuyng therof. And of this cōstraynyng speketh saynt Barnarde saynge:
let the outwarde senses be gathered to gether in one / and cōstray¦ned or subdewed vnder the discipline and rule of the good wyll. And so kepte vnder with the burden of good werkes / and made obedient to the seruice of the spirite / that in no meanes they be suffered to come at large at theyr sensuall pleasure. Of this dili∣gent kepynge of our thoughtes / speketh also our lord in his lawe saynge:Deuter. vi. C. Caue ne vn{quam} obliuiscaris domini dei tui qui eduxit te de ter¦ra Egipti. Beware that thou neuer forget thy lorde god / whiche hath delyuered the from the thraldome that thou had in the lande of Egipte (that is from the thraldome of the deule) by the meri∣tes of his glorious passion. We may alwayes thynke of this be∣nefite / though we can nat at al tymes deuoutly remembre it. And therfore to remembre or thynke euer of god / we be constrayned by his cōmaundement. But to remembre hym with deuotion we be nat bounde / for deuotion is onely of the speciall grace of god which is nat in our power. And therfore we be exhorted & taught to continue the remembraūce of god and of his cōmaundmentes saynge:Deutet. 6. B. Meditaberis ea sedens in domo tua, et ambulans in itinere, dormiens, at{que} consurgens, er ligabis ea quasi signum in manu tua, et mouebunt ante oculos tuos, scribes{que} ea in limine et in ostijs do∣mus tue. Thou shalt (sayth Moyses in the name of our lorde) re∣membre them (that is the cōmaundmentes and benefytes of god) sittynge in thy house and walkynge in thy iourney / slepynge and rysyng / or at thy downe lyenge and vp risynge / and thou shal tye and fasten them vnto the as a signe or a marke in thy hand / and they shalbe euer before thyn eyne or syght / and thou shalt wrytte them in the postes & doores of thy house. And though these wor∣des in the litterall sense ben spoken of the .x. cōmaundmentes of god / yet we may so moche the more conueniently applye them to the remēbraunce of the passion of our lord / for asmoche as it was more to our profite and comforth that our lord god wolde suffre deth and passion for our redēpcion / than yt he gaue to vs his com¦maūdmētes. And also that is the law & ordre of ye benefites of god that more that they be {pro}fitable to vs: the more we shulde remēbre them. Therfore al the articles or particular paines of the passion of our lord shuld be diligētly gadred to geder & cōmend to memo∣ry / accordyng to the wordes of our sauiour sayng:Iohīs. 6. B Colligite frag∣menta ne pereant. Gather vp to gether the fragmētes) that is the {per}ticular paynes of his passion) and put thē to gider as it were in a litel fagot / & so cōmēde them to memory lesse they perisshe from your hertt{is} by forgetfulnes / ī this maner dyd ye spouse as we rede
in the canticles / where as she sayd.Cāti. 1. D. Fasciculus mire dilectus meus michi inter vbera mea commorabitur. My dere beloued spouse is to me as a lytell fagot of myrre / he shall abyde in my herte & me∣mory.Super can¦tica sermo∣ne. 43. Saynt Barnarde declarynge this same text sayth in this maner / Brethern this hath ben myne accustomable maner fro my firste conuersion. I haue ben diligent to gather a lytell fagot of myrre / the which I put in to my bosome as a tresure to recōpence for the great hepe of merites that I shulde haue had / but my vn∣kyndnes to god is suche that I want suche merites / and therfore I say I was dilygent to gather to me a lytell fagot of mirre of al the paynes and affliccions of my lord and sauiour Iesu / fyrste of his great pouertye / necessitye and affliccion or paynes that he suf¦fred in his yong and tender age: after that of his great labours that he had in preachynge his fatigation and werynes in goyng about frome cyte to cyte / frome towne to towne / frome cuntrye to cuntrye / his continuall watche in prayer / his temptacions in his fastyng his wepynges and teares in compassion of the miserable people / the disceites and craftes of the scribes and phariseys that lye in a wayt of hym to take hym in a trype with some defaute in his cōmunicacyon or speche / and laste of the parylles and daun∣gers that he was in amonges his awne nacion & frendes / of his rebukes / mockes / scornes / dispises / spittynges / buffetynges / be∣tinges / scurgyng{is} / with al other that he suffred for our saluacion. Of al the whiche is there / plentuously made mencion in the foure euangelystes / these thinges to remēbre sayth saint Barnarde) I recounted for wisdome,Vbi supra. In these thynges I set the perfeccion of my iustyce / in these stode all my cunnynge & knowlege / in these I put the ryches of my helth and thaboundaunce of my merites / of these somtyme I dranke a draught of holsome bytternes or pey∣naunce / in these agayne I receyued the swete vnction of consola∣cyon. These thynges done strength me & also erecte me in aduer∣sityes / they represse me and kepe me meke in prosperityes / & they gyde me and lede me by a sure way in this lyfe / where as is nowe sorowe / nowe ioye / nowe pleasure / nowe payne / so that Ider nat go out of the ryght way aslonge as I folowe them. ¶Howe we shulde fele Christes passyon in our loue / wyll and affeccion. The seconde Chapitre. SEcondly we shuld fele (I sayd) the passion of Christ in our wyl / desire / loue & affeccion. For this passion which hither to hath ben onely remēbred in our thoughtes & vnderstandynge if we wyl {pro}fit it must procede in to our affeccion / so that it be nat
onely remembred in our thoughtes / but that also the deuotion of the remēberer be enflamed by loue in his wyl. And suerly yf our vnderstandynge do his diligence in the remembraunce of the said passion / it shall shortly moue our affection. And so the passion of our lord shall nat onely in our cogitacions be remēbred / but also it shal inflame your wyl by compassion & pitye. Wherunto we be admonysshed by our lord saynge.Cāti. viii. S. Pone me vt signaculum super cor tuum. Put me (sayth our lord) as a seale vpon thy herte. A seale (as ye knowe) if it be īprynted in to wax / it leaueth in it his image. So our lord wolde that his passion shuld be so imprinted in our hertes / nat onely be ofte remembraunce / but also by deuoute com¦passion / that the prynt and image therof abyde in our affection and feruent desyre: so that as Iesus Christe was made reed and blody on the crosse / so our deuocion in vs may be made reed and feruent by the vertue of compassion. And hereunto we be coun∣selled by the wordes of Moyses saing.Leuiti. xxix. B. Sumes de sanguine vituli et pones super conua altaris. That thou shal take of the blode of the calf signifieng the blode of Christe / and thou shal put it vpon the corners of the aulter that is vpon thy thought{is} & affections / with feruent remembraūce of the blode of Christe. And so we shal ful∣fyll the admonition of saynt Paule: saynge as I sayde before. Hoc sentite in vobis quod et in Christo Iesu.Philip. ii. A Feale in your self that Christe Iesu felt. And thus we may feele hym in our soule .ii. ma¦ner of wayes. First by the bitter affection of compassion / and that is when we remembre the passion of Christe with so great com∣passion: that it bringeth forth of vs most bytter teares / so yt suche a deuoute soule may say with the wise man.Eccli. 41. A O mors {quam} amara est me moria tua. O deth howe bitter and sorowfull is thy remēbraunce and specially the remembraūce of the deth of Christe. Secondly we may feele hym in our hertes or soules by the moste swete and pleasaunt affection of deuotion / and that is when we remembre most inwardly & depely the great loue and charite of Christ that wolde suffer so greuous paynes and shamefull dethe for so vyle wretches and vnkynde as we be. And so this deuout remēbraūce bringeth forth of vs most swete teares of deuotion: So that we may say that is writen in the boke of Iudith.Iudith .v. B. Fontes aquarum ob dulcorati sunt. That is the bitter fountayns ben made swete and delectable. A figure herof we rede in scripture where as our lord commaunded to Moyses to put a tree (that was both longe and bitter) in to the water that was so bitter that no man culde drynk therof / and so therby the waters were made swet and delectable.Exod. xv. D.
What is signified by this water but the passion of our lord which is so bitter and paynful that no man may taste therof. And by this long and bitter tree / is signified the longe and continual remem∣braunce. Whiche if it be ioyned and put to the passion of our lord / it shal make it swete and pleasaunt / so that the more we taste of it by deuout remēbraunce / the more delectable it shalbe to vs. And therfore our holy mother the churche sayth in a certen hympne: Dulce lignum,Cru fide. dulces clauos, dulce pondus sustinet. That is: The swete tree of the crosse susteyneth and bereth a swete burden / nay∣led fast with swete nayles. For that whiche was most bitter and paynfull to our sauiour Iesu in his passion / somtyme is moste delectable and comfortable to vs in our deuoute meditations. These two maners of teares that is bitter and swete / sprynge out of this deuout affection of the passion of our lorde.Su{per} canti sermon̄. 43 And hereunto speaketh saynt Barnarde as we sayd a fore. In the remēbraunce of the paynes that my sauiour Iesu sufferd for me / I drynke som∣tyme a draught of holsome bitternes. And somtyme agayne I re¦ceyue the pleasaunt vnction or oyntment of deuoute consolation. ¶Howe we shuld fele Christes passion in our actes and dedes. The thyrde Chapitre. THyrdly we shulde fele the paynes of Christe in our effec∣tes and outward operations. That lyke as the deuout remembraunce of Christes passion enflameth our affec∣tion and loue inwardly / so it myght appere & be shewed outwardly in our warkes and lyuing. Hereunto we be coūseled by the wyse men sayng:Prouer. 24. D. Prepara foris opus tuum. That is to say: Suche deuotion as thou haste inwardly conceyued by affection and loue / let it be shewed outwardly in thy dedes. For as saynt Gregore sayth:Omel. 30. the dede outwardly done / is a sufficient argumēt or proue of the inwarde loue. So by the inwarde loue of man is shewed or knowen his inwarde compassion. Also it is writen in the seconde boke of the kynges:Cap. vii. A. Omnia que habes in corde tuo, fac quoniam dominus tecum est. As if he shulde say: what so euer good thynge thou hast conceyued in thy hert / shewe it outwarde in thy dedes.Cap. 25. D. Also it is writen in Exodo. Fac secundum exemplar quod tibi monstratum est in monte. Performe in thy lyuynge that goodnes / whiche thou receyued of god in thy soule. And therfore our lorde sayth to vs in his gospel:Luce. 9. C. Si quis vult venire post me, ab∣neget semetipsum et tollat crucem suam quotidie. If any man wyll be my disciple and cum after me / let hym denye hym selfe / that is
forsake his owne wyl and pleasure / and take his own crosse / that is: put his owne body to payne and that dayly. For we must cōti∣nue in penaunce / and so folowe Christe in our lyuyng outward∣ly and nat onely inwardly / and hereto saith saint Paule:2. Corin. 8. D. Ostentio¦nem caritatis vestre ostendite in faciem ecclesie. That is / shewe your good wyl and charitie openly in the face of the churche / that is in our werkes & in our dedes.Pri. Pet. 2. D. And saynt Peter sayth: Christus passus est pro nobis relinquens exemplum vt sequamini eum. Christ hath suffered paynes and deth for vs / gyuynge vs example to fo∣lowe hym / he doth nat say that we shulde haue a wyll & desyre on∣ly to folowe hym / but he sayth playnly that Christe hath left vn∣to vs an example that we shulde folowe hym in our dedes in suffe¦rynge paynes as he dyd. And then it myght be truely sayd of vs / that we fele in our selfe that Christe felte / whan he suffere lyke paynes as Christe suffred / so that by suche sharpe penaunce and harde laboures our bodyes be subdued and our blode minysshed. And so the sayng of scripture may be verifyed in vs:3. reg. 2. A. Effudit san∣guinem belli in pace. He hath shed the blode of battell in the tyme of peace. They do shed the blode of battell in the tyme of peace / which by sharp penaunce & great bodyly labours so subdue theyr bodyes / that theyr blode is moche minisshed / and theyr face made pale. Suche maner of exercises of the body done for god / is re∣puted as a martirdome / and therby somwhat we reanswere vnto the passion of our lord.Ser. xxx. su¦per Cantic. Herunto speaketh saynt Barnard sayng: this dayly penaūce and affliction of the body / is a certayne kynde of very martirdome and effusion of blode / it is a litel more gentyl and nat so hugsome as is tormētes and deth by the swerd or other lyke / but it is more paynfull for the cōtinuance therof / the other is sone done / but this lasteth long. This is necessarie & profitable for vnperfite persons that be weyke in spirite and nat stronge in fayth / and therfore dare nat auenture to suffer martyrdome and deth for Christe / but they be content to supply it by this martyr∣dome / that is dayly and continuall penaunce / whiche by the con∣tinuaunce is more paynfull. And thus the deuoute persones do fele in them selfe by theyr outwarde penaunce the passyon of our lord / As whan by sharp penaunce they subdue theyr bodies ouer come vyce and all sensuall passions / and so continue in this crosse of penaunce with Christe. ¶How we shulde fele Christes passion in our pouertie and other necessites. The fourth Chapitre.
FOurthly we shulde fele the paynes of Christe in our penury / pouertie and other necessities / so that remē∣brynge the passion of Christe / we shulde gladly suf∣fer all pouertie and penurie / and neuer to desyre that thynge that is pleasaunt to the bodye / for the pleasure therof or takyng any thinge more then very necessitie requyreth / saynge with holy Iob: Donec deficiam non recedam ab innocen∣tia mea.Iob .xxvii. A. As longe as I lyue I shall nat forsake myn innocencie. And though we be in a maner consumed and lost thoroughe hun∣ger and penurye / so that we may say with the prophet Dauid: Defecit in dolore vita mea. My lyfe is consumed thorough so∣rowe / my bodye and my herte also.Psal. xxx. And surely this maner of pe∣nurie and necessitie / nat onely of meate and drynke / but also of all thynges that may be delectable to man / is accōpted to good men in this lyfe / as a kynde of martyrdome. By whiche necessityes if we strongly and gladly bere them for god / we satisfye partly to our lord for his passion. And herunto speketh saynt Barnard saynge: Wylfull pouertie is a certen kynde of martyrdome. Al∣myghty god descendyng from thinestimable riches of heuen / and cōmynge in to this worlde / wolde nat any of these ryches of this world / but cam in so great pouertie / that anon as he was borne for his credell / he was layde in to a crybbe in a vyle stable with out the towne / for his mother culde haue no lodgyng in the cytie.In flor. lib. v. Cap. xxx. Of his pouertie also appereth by his answere that he made to one the whiche sayd that he wold folowe hym where so euer he went. And our lord answered and sayd:Math. 8. C. Vulpes foueas habent, et volu∣cres celi nidos, filius autem hominis non habet vbi caput suum recli net. Foxis haue cauys / or dennys / and byrdes of the ayre haue nestes / but the sonne of the virgine hath no place wherin to hyde or reste his heed. In this necessitie was thapostle Paule / as it appereth by his wordes saynge: I was in many labours / ofte in pryson / bette and scourged aboue good ordre / very ofte in peryll of dethe / in perylles of flodes / in perylles of theues / in perylles of gentyles / in daungers within the cytye / in great daūgers also in wyldernes / and also in the see / in perylles of the false Iues.2. Corin. xi. E. F. I was also in labour & great miserie / in great watch / in hūger and thrist / in moche abstinēce / in cold & in nakednes. These and many mo dyd thapostle suffer. And the mo yt we paciently suffer of these or such lyke / the more shal we fele the passion of Christ in our self. ¶How we shuld fele Christes passion in our rebukes and dispisynges. The .v. Chap
FYftly we ought to fele the passion of Christ in our rebukes and reproues / that is with most profoūd mekenes / we shulde vtterly dispyse our selfe and thynke our selfe the warst of all other: sayng euer in our hertes with mournynge: I am gyltye of Christes deth / for I am the cause of his deth. He suffered for me / and I in no thynge reanswere to his benefytes. And therfore it is conuenient that we somwhat recompense with a contrite and meke spirite / that whiche we can nat or do nat in our warkes or dedes outwarde / that as Christe dyd meke hym selfe for vs vnto the deth / yea to the most vyle and shamfull deth of the crosse / so we shulde meke our selfe as gyltie and culpable for his deth. These maner of wayes we shulde fele that Christe suffred for vs / for these maner of wayes we were in hym. Fyrste we were in his vnderstandyng eternally before the begynnynge of the worlde / and so in his mynde that he wyll neuer forget vs. And therfore he sayth by his prophete Esaye:Esa. 49. D. Nunquid potest obliuisci mater infantem suum vt non misereatur filio vteri sui, Et si illa oblita fuerit: ego tamen non obliuiscar tui. May a naturall mother (sayth our lorde by the prophet) forget her yonge chylde borne of her owne body? and so forget hym that she wyl nat haue any pitie of hym? as he myght say / Nay. And though it so be that she forget hym / yet I assure the I wyl neuer forget the. Se∣condly we were in Christe / nat onely in his vnderstandynge or mynde / but also in his affection and loue. And this appereth wel by his owne wordes spoken by the prophet Hieremy / where as he sayth thus: In charitate perpetua dilexi te, ideo attraxi te, mi∣serans tui.Hier. 31. A. I haue (sayth our lorde) loued the in a perpetual cha¦ritie / and therfore hauyng great compassion on the / I haue dra∣wen the to me. Thyrdly we were in hym / that is in theffecte of his werkes / for all that god wrought in this worlde / was to the helpe of man. And what so euer Christe dyd or suffered in this world / was nat for his owne profit / but all was for the comforth of man.Ser. feri. 4. bdoma∣de peose. And herunto saynt Barnarde (after that he had recoū∣ted or noumbred all the labours and paynes that Christe suffered in this lyfe) sayde: Who is he that knoweth whether the fruite and profyt of all these labours and paynes redounde or come to my profyt or nat / And he answereth and sayth: It is all done and gyuen to my profit and comforth. For it coulde be gyuen to none other. Nat to aungell / for he had no nede therof. Nat to the deuyll / for he myght take no profit therof / for he shall neuer ryse
from dampnation. Also our sauiour toke nat of hym the nature and similitude of aungell / nor yet the similitude of the deuyl / but he toke the nature of man / and that to redeme man. Fourthly we were in Christe / that is in his pouertie and penurie / for all the payne / pouertie and miserie that he suffred / was for vs. And herunto speaketh saynt Paule sayng:2. Corin. 8. B. Christus cum diues esset fac∣tus est pro nobis pauper: vt illius inopia nos diuites essemus. Christe beynge most ryche / became poore for vs / that by his pouertie and necessitie we may be made riche. Fyftly we were in Christe / that is in his rebukes and dispisinges / for all the mockes / scornes / re∣preues and dispisynges with other lyke that Christe suffred / was for vs / that therby he myght reconsile vs to his father in heuen / and promote vs vnto the euerlastynge glorie. And therfore as Christe dyd all these for vs / so let vs suffer with hym and for our euerlastynge profyte. ¶The .iiii. particle. ¶Of diuerse maners and wayes to remēbre Christes passion and it is diuided in to .vi. Chapitres howe we may considre Christes passion with a mynde to folowe it. Chap. i. ANd that thou may the better bere in mynd our lordes passion / thou ought to knowe that a man may behaue hym self in remembraūce therof .vi. maner of wayes Fyrst he may considre this passion with a mynd to fo∣lowe it. Secondly to haue cōpassion therof. Thyrdly to merueyl therof. Fourtly to ioy therof. Fyftly to resolue or relēt his herte in to that passion. And sextly surely to rest therin so that this imitation or folowyng / shalbe to the purgation & direction of his soule. The compassion: to the vnion and loue / thadmi∣ration or merueylyng: shalbe to the leuation or lyftyng vp of his mynde / the ioy and gladnes: to the openynge and dilatation of his herte / the relentynge shalbe to his perfecte conformation / and the rest or quietnes: shalbe to the perfection of his deuotion. Of eche one of these seuene we shall write a lityll / so that the paynful passion of our moste louynge sauiour Iesu / myght the more ra∣ther enflame and kyndle our dull affection and loue / illumyne and lyghten our blynde reason or vnderstandynge / and also that it myght be the more strongly inprinted in to our sliper meōries. ¶Fyrst I say we shuld cōsidre the passion of our sauiour Christe
with a mynde to folowe it. For the imitation and folowynge of Christe is the most hyghe and perfite religion and rule of a per∣fite person. To folowe Christe (I say) in his passion and deth by a continuall remēbraunce / a louynge and affectuous compas∣sion and by vertuous operation: is thexemplar of perfection of all lyfe and treuth / so that this passion be our rule and thordre of our liuynge in all our meritorious dedes. For Christe is as a boke layd open on the pulpyt of the crosse / where as he taught obedience / pacience / mekenes and charitie / for the whiche: if we dayly vse and performe them / we shalbe crowned in eternall feli∣citie. And specyally we shuld lerne here / how our sauiour Christe behaued hym self in the chapitre / whiche was holden and kept for hym. Of the whiche saynt Barnarde speketh sayng: Iesus stode before the president: inclynynge or bowynge downe his heed / speakynge but fewe wordes with a softe voyce / a quiete chere or countenaunce / lokynge downwarde to the erthe / and redy to re∣ceyue or beare patiently all rebukes and beatynges / which thyn¦ges / whan we do nat: or elles be negligent to do and suffer them how can or may we say that we folowe Christ. Truely somoche the more be we desolate of goodnes: in how moche we be separate or departed for this exemplar & rule / our sauiour Iesu. We shuld haue a wyl and mynde (as moche as is in vs) to be dispised of all men / deiect / troden vnder foote / set at nought / mocked & scorned / to be scourged / whipped / bet / and to suffer persecution for Christ / and also to be rebuked in our good dedes or werkes for Christe. Also we shuld haue a desire to be poore or naked with Christ / no∣thyng couetyng or desiryng / and that namely inordinatly / but to be fully cōtent with suche pouertie as god sendeth vs. And more ouer it shuld be a greuous payne to vs / and moche sharp sorowe to our hert / to haue any thynge and that superfluous. We shulde abhorre to tast of any delectable and swete thyng / rather desiryng to be fed with vyle and bitter meates or drynkes / remēbryng that our sauiour Iesu was so fed at this passion. And shortly to con∣clude / we shulde remembre and depely considre what our sauiour Iesu suffred for vs / and how he ordered hym selfe in his passyon and paynes / that we myght conforme our selfe to hym in asmoche as we may. For his passyon shall nat saue vs synners that haue vse of reason / except we enforce our self to folowe hym / and to con¦forme our selfe vnto his pacience in some maner / or at leest / haue a full wyl & desyre therunto / accordyng to the sayng of the prophet Esay / where as the sonne of god complaynethe to his father of
suche as wyll nat folowe hym saynge:Esa. xlix. A. In vacuum laboraui, sine causa et vane fortitudinem meam consumpsi. I haue laboured in vayne / without frute or vaynly I haue consumed or wasted my strength / for fewe take hede to folowe me. Also the prophet Hie∣remy sayth:Hiere. vi. G. Frustra conflauit conflator. malicie enim illorum non sunt consumpte. That is the trier or goldsmyth hath tryed / blo∣wen and laboured in vayne / for the rust of theyr malice or synne is nat consumed. Of the whiche text the glose sayth: the onely pas¦sion of Christe shall nat saue them / except they folowe it in good lyuyng. And herto saint Gregory sayth: If we serche & labour to haue here pleasaunt and delectable thynges. What trust we to haue in the lyfe to come? he that wyll nat mourne here where as he is as a pilgrem: he shall nat ioy in heuen as a cytezen or as of the houshold of heuen. Therfore the more thou perceyue thy selfe to abounde in temporal goodes / in worldly honour and corporal pleasure or consolation here in this lyfe / the more cause hast thou to be heuy and sad / for asmoch as thou art farre from the true con¦formitie and folowyng of Christ / and so farre from the cōsolation of god. wherfore if we wyll reigne with Christe / it is necessarie that we suffer for Christ. For there is no disciple aboue his mays∣ster. Sith therfore we be put in this world as in a felde to feight / where as our maister Christe faught strongly vnto ye dethe / that sowdiour or person the which here suffereth no beatyng{is} or woū∣des for Christe / shall ryghtuously appere in ye world to come vn∣glorious and without glory or vnworthy rewarde. And therfore saint Gregory expoūdyng these wordes of our lord:Math. vii. B. Angusta est via que ducit ad vitam. It is a narowe or streit way yt ledeth man to euerlastyng life: saith thus. It is a strait way yt ledeth to heuen for if we wyl come thider / we must liue here in this worlde / & yet nothyng to haue or to folowe of the cōcupiscence of the worlde / to couit nothyng that apperteineth to any other man / to gyue & for∣sak our owne goodes / to dispise the laudes and praisynges of the world / to honour them that dispise vs / to forgyue hertly iniuries done to vs / and also to loue them with hert and continually that doth suche wronges vnto vs / and to do good to them whiche all our sauiour Christe fulfylled here in this lyfe / leauynge example vnto vs to folowe his steppes / whiche steppes and examples the more narowe and paynfull or strayt they be in this lyfe / the more they shalbe ampliate / cōfortable & ioyful in this lyfe to come. And therfore the prophet Dauid sayth.Psal. iiii▪ In tribulatione dilatasti mihi. In tyme of tribulation thou hast opened and spred abrode to me
thy consolations and comfortes. And therfore the holy seruaun∣tes of god / whan they perceyue them selfe to abounde in the pro∣sperities of this worlde / then they be very ferefull suspectynge leste that they shuld receyue here in this lyfe the frute and reward of theyr labours / fearyng leste that the iustice of god shulde se in them any priuy or lorkynge wounde of synne. For the whiche of the ryghtuousnes of god they ought to be dampned. And therfore he rewardynge theyr good dedes here in this lyfe with temporall pleasures wyl expel them from ye true inward & eternal pleasures. ¶How we may cōsidre the passion of Christ with a mynde to haue compassion therof. The .ii.. Chaptre. SEcondly we shulde considre the passion of our lord to haue compassion therof / that is to say: we shulde ofte remēbre in our hertes / his beatynges and woun¦des / mockes and rebukes / and euery ymaginyng in ourself / what deiection / cōtempt / sorowe and afflic∣tion he suffred in his herte and in his bodye as we sayd before. O how then the swetnes and pleasure of aungelles Iesus Christ was replenisshed with great bitternes and sorowe of payne. O howe moche that payne dyd greue hym / but moche more our vnkyndnes. And aboue al dyd greue hym the trouble and afflic∣tion of his mother / whom he so tēderly dyd loue / and agayn was so derely loued of her / that for compassion of his payn and dethe / she was in a maner as deed or semed to dye. In remēbraunce her∣of / we haue great matter and cause to wepe / for our synnes were the cause of his passion and deth / and also of her compassion and great dolore or heuynes. Wherfore to haue cōpassion of Christes passion / let vs depely and inwardly cōsidre that we were the oc∣casyon of the deth of the onely sone of god / we were false tratours vnto hym and so deserued deth / but he of his inestimable charitie wolde suffer that shamful deth / to deliuer vs from eternall dethe. Let this charite / his scourginges / woūdes / mockes / rebukes and deth perse the inward depnes of our hert / let there be nothynge in vs / but that it be anoynted with this cōpassion / and also be wrap∣ped with sorowe and heuynes for that deth: and so we shuld dayly mourne as the louing mother mourneth the deth of her onely and tēderly belouyd sone. O how moch ought we to loue hym / and to be kynd to hym which suffred so shamful a deth for our redēption. Therfore let vs studye and labour in all that we may to be asso∣ciate and ioyned to hym with a most feruent loue. For the more
feruently we loue hym / the more shall we haue compassion of his passion / and so this feruent loue and compassion shall so moche encrease to gether and be augmented / that they shall brynge vs to the perfection of loue / and to the fruition of our louer. Wherfore let vs be sory with hym / trustynge verely / and that without any doubte / that if we be founde here to be partakers of his sorowe in sorowynge for his deth and passion / we shalbe made his felo∣wes and companyons or partakers of his ioy and consolation. For surely he that wolde nat hyde his resurrection from Marie Magdalene that with sorowe sought hym / he wyll nat denye his glorie to vs / that religiously and deuoutly do mourne with hym for his passion.Rom̄. 8. C. And therfore saynt Paule sayth: Si tamen com∣patimur vt et simul glorificemur. If we here suffer with Christe / we shalbe glorified with Christe. Also our sauiour Christ saith: Beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iusticiam: quoniam ip∣sorum est regnum celorum.Math. 5. A. Blessyd be they that suffer persecution for iustice (that is for Christe) for they shall haue the kyngdome of heuen.Ser. C. lxv. de t. ca. 6. And contrarie wyse saynt Austen sayth: If thou be ex¦cepte from passion and payne / that is if thou suffer nat here some payne / thou shalbe exempte from the nombre of the chylderne of god.Hebre. xii. B. For as saynt Paule sayth: Quem dominus diligit: corrigit: castigat: flagellat autem ominem filium quem recipit. Whom our lorde loueth / hym he doth chastyse / he correcth euery one of them whom he receyueth to his mercy and fauoure. Therfore if ye be nat vnder correction as all the chyldern of god be / ye be nat the childerne of god / but of the deuyll. Hereby ye may perceyue that good lyfe doth nat stand principally in good fare or wel liuynge / but rather in paciently sufferyng wronges for Christe / though it be a comen prouerbe / that he liueth well / that feadeth well / Sed mentita est iniquitas sibi / but carnall men speke carnally / and so deceyue them selfe with lyes / for as Gerson sayth: the more that sensual nature is oppressed and ouercome for god / the more grace we receyue / & our inward man is dayly reformed vnto thimage of god with newe visitations of grace. And therfore I may say that man is conformed / vnit and incorporate to god by werynge that moste noble and precious garment of payne and passion / whiche our sauiour Iesus lorde and maker of all creatures / dyd were and suffer in his owne bodye in this lyfe. Hereunto sayth saynt Gregore: The torment and payne that our lorde suffered / gloryfyeth hym bothe inwardelye and outwardelye. In vs also / it compelleth hym to come to grace that wolde nat come.
It teacheth and enformeth the ignorant / it kepeth vertue / it defen¦deth from sekenes of synne / it quyckeneth the dull person / it me∣keth the proude persone / it crowneth and rewardeth thinnocent / and it stirreth or moueth man to suffer gladly dethe / wherby he may come to euerlastynge lyfe.Pri. Corin. xv. G. Prayses and thankes be to god the father / whiche hath gyuen vnto vs the victorie / thorowe the deth and passion of his sonne Iesu Christe Amen. ¶Howe we may consydre the passion of Christ with a mynde to meruayl therof. The .iii. Chap THyrdly we shulde considre the passion of Christe to mer¦uayl therof. It is a wonderous thyng to consydre / who suffered / what he suffered / and for whome he suffered. Fyrst I say it is a meruaylous thynge to consydre who suffered. It was the sonne of god theternall / and onely sonne of god / very god and man / all good / all myghty / all wyse / the kynge of glorie. And what dyd he suffer? to be layd and to abyde as an infirme and frayle chylde .ix. monethes in his mothers wombe to be poorly borne / to be chased and dryuen in to a straunge coūtre / he sufferd hongre / thrist / heat / colde / penurie / pouertie / tempestes / stormes / persecutions / lyenge in waite to accuse hym / beatynges / bondes / scourgynges / mockes / rebukes / sclaunders / with many other paynes and sorowes as we shewed before / so that the glo∣rie of god was be spewed and all defowled with spittynges / the iustice of god was contempned / the iudge was falsly iudged / he that neuer offended was blamed / the innocent was accused and sclaundered / god was blasphemed / Christe was dispysed / lyfe was sleyne / and therfore the sonne withdrewe and hyd his lyght / and the mone waxed blacke and derke. These and many other mo paynes suffered paciently / our most louynge sauiour Iesus / whiche as a meke lambe was led vnto the dethe / and he wold nat ones resist his enemyes / though with one worde or one thought he myght haue cast downe or drowned all his enemyes in the de∣pest pyt of hell. But for whom suffered he all these great paines? surely for his most cruell and synfull enemyes / for his most wyc∣ked seruauntes or bondmen / for false tratoures / contempners or dispisers of his godly maiestie / and for moste vnkynde wretches vnto theyr creatour and maker. Syth therfore suche a glorious kyng pure and innocent suffred so many paynes and rebukes for so vile / false / wycked / and most vnkynd caytiues / to whom he had
exhibite and shewed before that tyme all signes and tokens of be∣nignitye and goodnes. Was nat this a wonderous and meruay∣lous thynge? Who may sufficiently meruayl of this thyng / to con¦sidre and se the most wyse / pure / myghtie / holy / and the euerlas∣tynge beautie of glorie of god / to suffer so shamfull dethe for so stynkyng carion. In all these thynges we may well wonder and meruayl of the great goodnes and charitie of god. For he of his infinite charitie made (of his owne flesshe and bodye / made reed with his owne blode) a reclamatorie or a lewer to call vnto his mercy and grace / those wylde hawkes and vnkynde people / the whiche by inordinate loue to the flesshe and the worlde / had taken theyr flyght from the hand and fauour of the noble fawconer our sauiour Iesus. Of the which hawkes / speketh the prophet Osee saynge:Osee. ix. C. Effraim quasi anis auolauit. Effraym hath flowen away or taken her flyght as a wylde hawke. Effraym is as moche to say by interpretation as augmenta encreasinges / and it may wel signifye suche people as here haue theyr pleasure in worldly ho∣nours and pastymes / and encrease in them. Suche people lyke vnto vngentyll or wylde hawkes flye from the hand and fauour or loue of god / vnto the caryon of the bodye or of the worlde / and fede therof. And if they wyl nat be reclaymed vnto ye hand of this fawconer / neyther by his callynge or cryenge / nor yet by the she∣wynge of his lewre / that is by the remembraunce of his passion and dethe / they shalbe lefte vnto the power and handes of the ra∣uenar of hell the deuyll. Herunto our lorde speaketh by the wyse man saynge:Pro. 1. C. Vocaui et renuistis, extendi manum meam, et non fuit qui aspiceret. &c. I haue called you (sayth our lord) and ye wold nat come. I haue extended my hand shewynge my lewre / that is gyuynge my benefytes vnto youe and specyally myne owne precyous bodye and blode / but there is none that wyll beholde or regarde it and gyue to me due thankes therfore. And it folo∣weth: Ego quo{que} in interitu vestro ridebo. And I shall laughe at you / whan ye shalbe deuoured by the deuyles of hell. We myght here also shewe many other occasions of meruaylynge / whiche be written in diuerse places of this treatys / and specially in the fyrste particle of this parte. ¶How we shuld consydre Christes passyon to reioyse and ioy therin. The .iiii. Chap.
FOrthly we shulde considre the passion of our lorde to ioy therin. For we shuld ioy therof for the redēption of mankynde for the reparynge and restorynge of the ruyne and decay of aungelles. And also we shuld ioy of the greate charitye and goodnes of god shewed in the sayd passion. Fyrste without doubte we ought greatly to re∣ioyse and ioy in our redemption whiche we had by the deth and passion of Christe, Who is he (I beseche you) that wyll nat be ioyfull and gladde of this deth and passion / whan he considereth that therby he is redemed from eternal dampnation / from the re∣buke of synne / from the powre of the deuyll / and from the misera∣ble paynes of hell? Secondly we shuld ioy that ye tall of aungell{is} is repared by the passion of Christe. Surely it may be a greate reioysynge to vs / whan we considre that so noble a college as is the companye of aungelles / thorough the deth of Christe shalbe repared and fulfilled with vs / so that of aungelles & of men shal∣be one heerd or flocke vnder one herdmā our sauiour Iesu Christ so that they and we may be all one in hym. Thirdly we oughte moste specyally to reioyse beholdynge in al the forsayd thynges the great and inestimable charite of our sauiour Iesu Christ our lorde and god. Howe or in what thynge myght he haue shewed more clerly or more to our comforth his most benigne goodnes / then in his most glorious passion / where as he suffered so sham∣full sharpe and greuous paynes for the deliueraunce of his ene∣my / and to glorifye hym that was worthy to be punysshed with eternall dethe?Deu. 32. C. And therfore scripture sayth: Inundationes maris quasi lac sugent, et thesauros altissimos arenarum. They shal sucke as it were mylke the swellynges or inundations and tempestes of the see, and also the depe and hyd treasoures of the sande or gra¦uell. By this suckynge is signifyed the confortable swetnes that we haue in the receyuynge of the precious bodye of our lorde / the whiche we receyue in the remēbraunce of the passion of our lord / and of the great treasure that was hyd in the manyfolde paynes and sorowes that he suffred before his dethe / wherby we were re∣demed / whiche we ought at all tymes to remembre. And therfore the prophet Dauid sayth:Psal. 136. Adhereat lingua mea faucibus meis si non meminero tui. I wolde my tunge shulde cleue faste to my iawes if I do nat remembre the. Then dothe the tunge cleue fast to the iawes / when a man nothynge regardynge spirituall pleasures / enforceth hymselfe to folowe worldly or carnall pleasures. The swetnes that cōmeth in to the soule by receyuynge of the sacramēt
redoundeth in to the iawes or chekes that be wel disposed / that is to say: it is nat onely comforth to a good soule / but also to all the poures of the bodye / as the suckynge of the salt water of the see / wherby is signified the bitter paynes of Christes passion. And these spirituall consolations be the treasures more precious then golde and precious stone. Also they be hyd treasures / for no man knoweth them / but he that receyueth them. And as the prophet Dauid sayth:Psal. 18. they be moche more to be desyred then golde or pre∣cious stone / and more pleasaūt or swetter then hony or any hony combe. For they that be replenysshed with this hyd treasure / that is / with thabundaūt remēbraūce of the passion of Christ through the plentuousnes therof: they speake wordes of swetnes and com¦forth / and ioy in a great iustice / for they haue the great plentuous¦nes of graces.Esa. lvi. D. And herunto the prophet Esay sayth: Gaudete su∣per eam gaudo vniuersi qui lugebatis super eam: et vt sugatis et re∣pleamini ab vberibus consolationis eius. &c. All ye that in tyme past mourned or wept in the cōsideration of the passion of Christ: ioy now therof in cōsiderynge the great profites that cometh ther¦of / sucke them / that is / depely and inwardly considre them / that ye may be replenisshed with the teates or pappes of his consola∣tions. And also ye shall mylke those pappys that ye may aboūde in all spirituall pleasure by the consideration of his great glorie. In the remembraūce of the passion of Christe when we considre his most greuous paynes / and how yt we were the cause of them / thorowe our vnkyndnes and synnes / then we sucke out of it so∣rowe and heuynes. And when we considre what profit comethe therof vnto mankynde / then we suck out of it great comforth and ioy. And these two be the teetes or pappys of the whiche the pro∣phet Esay speaketh: and of the whiche the faythfull people sucke great comforth in receyuynge the sacrament of the bodye of our lorde. From these pappys whan they be sucked cometh the mylke of chastitie and puritie of lyfe / and also the swetnes of all vertue. And when they be milked with our handes / that is / when nat on∣ly we considre the passion of Christe as is before sayd / but also in our lyung and werkes we cōforme our self therunto and werke therafter. Then we mylke and drawe them and so shal we flowe in thaboundaunce of spirituall pleasures thorough the consola∣tion of the holy gost. We myght also here for our purpose bryng in the saynge of our lorde in the gospell / where as he sayth:Lu. 15. B. Gau∣dium erit angelis dei in celo super vno peccatore penitentiam agen¦te: {quam} super nonaginta nouem iustis. There is more ioy in heuen
vnto the aungelles of god vpon one sinner conuerted from synne and doyng true penaunce / then of nynety and nyne iust and rygh∣tuous men that nede no penaunce. Who is this one synner but our sauiour Iesu Christe / whiche thoughe he were no synner in dede: yet he was reputed as the most great sinner / and so he wold be reputed and taken / for he came to beare our synnes / and to do penaunce and to suffer for all our synnes. ¶How we may cōsidre Christes passion to resolue or relent our hertes in to Christe and his passion. Chaptre. v. FYftly we shulde cōsidre the most blessed passion of our saui¦our Christe / to resolue and relent our hertes in to our sa∣uiour Christe and in to his passion. And that by a perfite trans∣formynge of our selfes in to hym. And that is done whan nat on∣ly we do folowe that passion / haue cōpassion therof / do meruayll therof / and ioy therof. But also in a maner the hole man is con∣uerted in to our lord and sauiour Iesus Christe crucified / so that in a maner at all tymes and in all places Christe crucified is pre∣sent with hym. And ferthermore that person is then in his mynde abstract and withdrawen from all thynges / and eleuate or lyfted vp aboue all pure creatures / and holly conuerted in to his lorde god crucified for vs. But this conuersion and relentynge of our hertes in to Christ crucified can nat cōueniently be / except there be a congruitie or a conuenient proporcion taken of some simili∣tude bytwixt our hertes and the sacrament of the aulter receyued of vs sacramentally or elles spiritually with the remēbraunce of the passion of our lorde crucified for vs.Li. 2. de ge∣neratione & corruptiō. For as the philosopher sayth / that nothynge noryssheth / but that whiche is lyke vnto the thyng norysshed. Wherfore sith this heuenly and spiritual foode that is the bodye of our lorde doth moche norysshe / it folowethe that it must be moche lyke vnto the person norysshed. The diges¦tion or norysshyng is then / whan the meate is altered and conuer¦ted in to the thyng norisshed. And therfore for that the materiall and corporall foode or meate is cōuerted in to that bodye that is fedde / it foloweth that the digestion must be both of the meat and of the drynke. Herunto it is writen in the first boke of the kyng{is}. Digere paulisper vinum quo mades.1. reg. 1. C. Digest that wyne that thou hast dronke. But in this spirituall meate: for asmoche as it is nat tourned in to vs / but cōtrarie wyse we be cōuerted in to it / it folo∣weth that the digestion must be in vs vnto the similitude of this heuenly and holsome meate. And this similitude or congruite of
this spirituall meate vnto the person fed / standeth in .v. thynges / that is in our digestion or conuersion in to this heuenly meate / in the similitude of ymage / in the cōformitie of nature / in the fayr¦nes or good ordre of our cōuersation / and in the takynge of our miserie / by paynes in a maner vntollerable. And these .v. bene more largely declared by the great clerke and noble doctor called Albertus Magnus:Distinē. 3. tract. 1. Ca. vi. in his boke de Eucharistia / that he wrote of the sacrament in a chapitre of these same .v. thynges. ¶How we may considre Christes passion to rest our selfes swetely therin. Chaptre .vi. SExtly we shulde considre this most blessed passion to reste our selfe moste swetely therin. And that is whan our herte (as we in the last cōsideration sayd) relented / cōuerted and trans¦formed in to our lorde crucified / doth nat yet cease but with a fer∣uent desyre remembreth the sayd passion / entryng mekely and de∣uoutly in to that hyghe and depe treasure of Christes passion as farre as is possible for man / meltynge and relentyng thoroughe loue and feruent deuotion in a maner fayntyng or faylyng in our selfe / and restyng in our lorde Christe Iesu crucified for vs. And then in how moche the more we faynt or fayle from our selfe / so moche the more we rest and cleue vnto our dearebeloued lord cru¦cified for vs. So that these .ii. that is / this rest or cleuyng to our lorde: and this feruent deuotion of loue do augment and encrease them selfe in them selfe / for the one helpeth the other. For as we sayd before / the more that our nature is oppressed / ouercome and doth languysshe or waxe seke for loue / the more it approcheth and draweth nygh vnto her dearebelouyd / and the more grace we re∣ceyue / & our inwarde man that is our soule is dayly visited with newe visitations and reformed vnto the ymage of god / vnto the tyme that it holly faylynge in it selfe be absorpte and taken in to that feruent chymney of loue of the passion of our moste beloued Iesu / and there to rest swetely / as the spousesse swetely restynge in the armes or bosome of her dearebeloued spouse / the whiche sayth thus in his canticles.Canti. 8. A. Adiuro vos filie sion: ne euigilare fa∣ciatis dilectam donec ipsa velit. I adiure and charge you: o you doughters of syon that ye do nat vnreste / vnquiete or wake my dearebeloued spousesse / vnto suche tyme it shall please her. This penetration and inwarde entrynge of our hertes in to our lorde god / & there restyng as we sayd before / is perceyued and vnder∣standyd
by the forsayd congruitie or conueniency taken of a simi∣litude as we declared in the fyfte consideration as ye may more clerely perceyue by the declaration of the noble forsayd doctor Al¦bert in his sayd boke de Eucharistia distinctione tertis tractatu primo.Vbi supra. Capi. vi. ¶The .v. particle is diuided in to .xix. Chaptres. ¶The first is of .xx. profites and fruites that cometh to man by the medytation of Christes passion / and that by thordre of the letters of the Alphabete or A. B. C. Fyrste Chapitre. THese profites bene writen by a deuout father of thordre of saynt Austen / a reder of diuinitie or holy scripture / called Rycharde of Laudenburge in his passionarie or boke yt he wrote of the passion of our lorde Iesu Christe and for your comforthe we wryte them here. ¶The fyrste profite. Animorum purgat feditatem. THe meditation of the passion of Christe doth purge the fylthynes of our myndes or soules. Hereunto saynt Iohan sayth: Sanguis Iesu Christi emundat nos ab omni peccato.1. Ioh. 1. C. The blode of Iesu Christ doth clense and make vs clene from all synne. And in his Apocalipse he sayth:Apoc. 1. B. Lauit nos a peccatis nostris in sanguine suo. He hath wasshed vs from our synnes in his blode. And therfore Christe in his gospel called his passion a baptisme / bycause it purgeth vs from our synnes / sayng thus:Luce. 12. F. Baptismo ha∣beo baptisari et quomodo coartor vs{que} dum perficiatur. I must be baptysed with a certen baptisme / and I am in great anguisshe vn¦to it be performed and done. And therfore the synners that be in good wyll & mynde to clense theyr cōsciences from the spottes of vices and synnes / shulde ofte remembre the passion of Christe. Euery mortall and dampnable synne / is as it were a buckler or shelde to defende the deuyll that he be nat expelled from the soule of the synner / but Christe brake this buckler and shelde by his passion and deth that he suffered on the crosse. And therfore the prophet Dauid sayde of Christe. Arcum conteret et confringet arma et scuta comburet igne.Psal. xlv. He shall breke the bowe and the ar∣mour / and he shall burne in the fyer the sheldes or bucklers: that is / he shal burne and consume our synnes (whiche be the bucklers
of the deuyll) with the feruent fyer of charitie / whiche he had in his glorious passion that he suffered on the crosse. And therfore we may say that he burned .vii. bucklers / that is the .vii. deedly synnes with the foresayd fyer of charitie. Fyrst pryde / by the in∣clynation and bowynge downe of his heed / for by that bowynge downe of his heed: it seamed as that he wolde haue fledde from the solempne title that was written aboue his crosse:Iohis. xix. D. Iesus naza renus rex iudeorum. This is / Iesus of Nazareth ye kyng of Iues. Secondly he consumed enuy by thextention and castyng abrode of his armes / as redy to receyue & halfe his enemyes for the great loue he had vnto them. Thyrdly / he burned the bukler of auarice or couitice / in his large gyftes that he gaue in his passion. And hereto sath saynt Barnarde: Lerne thou christiane how moche thou ought to loue thy sauiour Christe / whiche gaue hym selfe vnto the deth for our redemption / he gaue his flesshe vnto vs in meate / his blode to our drynke / the water of his syde / to wasshe vs / his garmentes / to his crucifiers / his bodye / to his disciples / and his mother / to his disciple Iohan. Fourtly he burned slouth by his wylfull and spedy comynge to his passion. Fyftly he con∣sumed wroth / by his sylence and softe or gentyll speche. Sextly he distroyed glotony / by the drynkyng of asel & gall. And seuent∣ly / he ouercame lychery / by the openynge and woundynge of his syde. And therfore we may say well that the meditation and re∣membraunce of the passion of Christe / doth purge and clense the fylthynes of our soules. ¶The .ii. profit. Bellatorum roborat pusillanimitatem. THe remembraunce of the passion of Christe doth conforte and strength warryours or fyghters / and that aswell in iust corporal batel / as in spirittuall. Of corporal batell it appered in the noble emperour Constantine / whiche caused the signe of the crosse to be borne before his hoste or army / to the intent that the passion of Christe shulde gyue strengthe vnto his knyghtes and sawdiours that faught vnder that baner of the crosse / and so it dyd.Li. 1. Ca. v. For as we rede in Historia tripertita / whan theyr enemys came agaynst them / he that bare the baner of the crosse was sore afrayd / and for that feare / he wold nat beare that banar but toke it vnto an other man / and so fled from ye felde / but or that he could conuey hym selfe away / he was wounded and slayne / where as the other {per}son that bare the baner of ye crosse / thorowe the vertue
of the passion of Christe / was saued from all hurt / thoughe ofte tymes he were in great daunger of his enemyes / and many dar∣tes shotte at hym whiche all dyd lyght in the baner and cleued fast therin. The passion of Christe doth also strength vs in our spi∣rituall battell / for therby onely we opteyne victorie. Herunto speaketh saynt Paule:Pri. corin. xv. G. Deo gratias qui ded it nobis victoriam per dominum nostrum Iesum Christum. Praysed and thanked be god that hathe gyuen to vs the victorie by the merites of our lorde Iesus Christe. ¶The .iii. profit. Christianorum excitat tepiditatem. IT also exciteth and stirreth the dulnes and coldnes of chris¦tians vnto deuotion. And herunto saynt Paule sayth: Re∣cogitate eum qui talem sustinuit a peccatorib{us} contradictionem.Heb. 12. A. &c. Remēbre hym that suffered such cōtradiction of synners agaynst hym selfe / that is / suche rebukes / dispisynges and shamefull deth that ye by suche remembraunce shulde nat faynt or waxe dull in your myndes. As if he sayde: If ye haue in mynde the passion of Christe / ye shall haue no tediousnes or dulnes in your good and meritorious werkes. ¶The .iiii. profit. Diabolorum fugat potestatem. IT chaseth away the power of the deuyles.Ser. 19. de stis ī fine. And therfore saynt Austen sayth: The signe of the crosse chaseth away from vs our gostly enemy / if so be that god inhabit our hertes by ofte remembraunce of his passion.Pri. reg. 16. D. We rede that Dauid with playenge on his harpe / chased away the euyl spirit from kynge Saul. Not yt there was so great vertue in the herpe / but in the signe of the crosse figured and signified by the tree of the herpe and thextention or streynynge of the strynges. And therfore at euery suggestion or temptation of the deuyll / it is expedient for vs to haue recours vnto the meditation of ye passion of Christ and to the signe of the crosse / of the whiche the deuyll is afrayd / and by it he is chased away lyke as the dogge is afrayd and fleith away whan he seith a staffe lyfted vp. And no meruayll / for tho∣rowe the vertue of the passion of Christe the whiche he suffered on the crosse / the deuyll was smyten downe and ouercome. Herunto speaketh the prophet Esay / saynge:Esa. 30. B. A voce domini pa∣uebit Assur virga percussus. Assur smyten with the rodde of god /
shall feare the voyce of god.1. Pe. 5. C. Assure is asmoche to say by interpre∣tation / as Negotiator / a marchaunt that laboureth in many pla∣ces or labours / and it signifieth the deuyll / the whiche laboryng and ronnynge about the worlde / searcheth whome he myght de∣uoure / he is neuer idle / but for as moche as he was ons smyten with the rodde of the crosse in the passion of Christe. Therfore he is greatly afrayd whan so euer he seeth the signe of the crosse made of that persone that faythfully calleth on the father / on the sonne / and on the holy gost / saynge: In nomine patris: et filij: et spiritus sancti. Moreouer lyke as a knyght or any other valiant man ouercome in battel / wolde be ashamed to abyde in that cham¦bre or place / where as his falle or vaynquesshynge were paynted so the deuyll ouercome thorowe the passion of Christe / wyll in no meanys abyde in that soule / where as he seeth the passion of Christe lyuely paynted by diligent remembraunce therof. ¶The .v. profit. Erroneorum reuocat pusilla nimitatem. THe meditation of the passion of Christe doth call agayne those that bene in erroure. For Christe hath made a caller or a lewer of his owne bodye / dyed / made reed with his owne precious blode, to call agayne his hawkes / the whiche hath flo¦wen away from the hande of the noble man / that is / the soule of them that haue forsaken Christe by synne or erroure.Osee. 9. C. Of whom the prophet Osee sayth: Effraim quasi auis auolauit. Effraim hath taken his flyght lyke vnto a wylde hawke. Effraim is asmoche to say by interpretation as fat or encreased / and it signifieth those persons that be encreased and made fatte in worldly and carnall pleasures / or in folowynge of theyr owne frowarde wylles and sensuall reasons. Suche persons haue taken theyr flyght from the loue of god / and if they wyll nat retourne and come agayne to the voyce of the caller or preacher / or at the shewynge of his lewer / that is / at the remembraunce of the passion of Christe / he wyll dimysse them / leaue them to the rauynous faucououre of hell / to the deuyll. It is wryten by the prophete Hyeremye / that our lorde sayth thus.Heire. 3. A. Reuertere ad me: et ego suscipiam te. Thoughe thou haste done neuer so many synnes / or folowed all hereses / yet retourne to me / and I shall receyue the. Also our lorde saythe by the prophete Esay.Esa. xliiii. D. Reuertere ad me {quod} redemi te. Retourne to me thou synner or erroneous persone / for I haue
redemed the and bought the agayne with my precious blode and passion. Take hede vnto this callynge / and obey therunto / for I assure you it is moche perilous and daungerous to withstand it. And it apereth wel by the wordes of our lorde spoken by the wyse man saynge:Prouer. 1. Vocaui et renuistis: extendi manum meam: et non erat qui aspiceret: ego quo{que} in interitu vestro ridebo. I haue cal∣led you and ye refused to come to me. I haue extendyd my hand with greate gyftes and benefites. I haue shewed vnto you my lewer / shed my precious blode for you / and ye wolde nat regarde these thyng{is} / and therfore I shalbe glad & ioyful of your {per}dicion. ¶The .vi. profit. Flagiciorum dibilitat pronitatem. THis meditation of the passion of Christe doth enfeble / make weyke and subdue our pronitie and redynes vnto vice.In manual Cap. xxii. And therfore saynt Austen sayth: Whan so euer my foule cogitation doth moue me: then I rūne to the woundes of Christ. Whan the flesshe or the sensualytie therof doth oppresse me: I ryse agayne thoroughe the remembraunce of the woundes of my lorde god. If the fyer of carnal cōcupiscēce enflame my mēbres / it is quenchyd by the remembraunce of the sonne of god. Also Origene sayth: Suche is the vertue of the crosse / that if it be in the syght of man / and faythfully holden and kepte in his herte / so that feruently and deuoutly that man beholde and remembre the deth and passion of Christe / there shall no concupiscence / no car∣nall motion / no furie or angre / nor any enuy ouercome that per∣sone / but sodenly at the presence and syght of that passion / all vice and synne shalbe chased and dryuen away. ¶The .vii. profit. Gaudiorum donat vbertatem. IT gyueth vnto man great plentie of spirituall ioy.Esa. 12. B. Here∣vnto speaketh the prophet Esay / saynge: Haurietis aquas in gaudio de fontibus saluatoris. Ye shall drawe from the profound and depe misterie of the pitie and mercy of god / waters / that is / abundaunce of teares / in ioy of deuotion / from the wellys and fountayns / that is / from the woundes of our sauiour Christe / the which at one tyme dyd shed furth blode in great abundaunce / but now dayly and cōtinually they bryng furth the incessable waters of grace. Wherfore the deuout soule restynge in this meditation sayth in the canticles: Sub vmbra illius quem desideraueram sedi: et fructus eius duicis gutturi meo.Canti. 2▪ A. I haue sitten & rested me vnder
the shadowe of hym whom I desired / and his frute is pleasaunt to my mouth and tastynge. And therfore Celestine sayth: those holy sayntes and seruauntes of god bene dyed in the blode of the most holy that shed his blode for them when they be crucified with Christe crucified / that is when they haue compassion of his so∣rowfull paynes of deth / and ioy in his loue and with his ioyfull loue drynkynge his blode / and eatynge his flesshe / embrasynge or halsynge with great pleasure his crosse and paynfull deth / lye∣kynge and suckyng his woundes / entryng in to his most louyng herte that was opened with a spere / and naylynge them selfe fast to hym vnseparably with the nayles of true and faythfull loue. These persons I say ben dyed & colored with the blode of Christ. ¶The .viii. profit. Horrorum vitat perpetuitatem. THis meditation of the passion of Christe oft remembred / doth deliuer vs from the paynes of hel. And herunto saint Paule sayth:Colos. 2. C. Expolians principatus et potestates. glosa . in∣ferni. Our sauiour Christ spoilynge the principates and powers of hel of theyr pray / that is of Adam / Noe / Abraham / and all other ryghtuous persons brought them to heuen with greate power. And therfore who so wyll nat occupy his mynde with the medi∣tation of the passion of Christe / it is to be feared of his dampna∣tion.Omelia. 15. For as saynt Gregory sayth: The worde of god / and spe∣cyally of the passion of Christe / is the meate and foode of ye soule / and as a quasye or seke stomake casteth vp the meat that it recey∣ueth: so that soule is seke that forgetteth the worde of god / herde of the preacher. But as that person is in peryll of dethe that can nat receyue or kepe his meate / so he is in peryll of eternall dethe that doth nat remēbre and lyue accordyngly to the spiritual food of the soule. Also saynt Barnarde sayth: It may be thought that that person shalbe eternally dampned by the ryghtuous iudgmēt of god / that in this tyme of grace is vnkynde vnto Christes pas∣sion / and therfore vnworthy the frute therof. ¶The .ix. profit. Ingeniorum illuminat ceciatem. IT is also an oyntment to oynt the blynde yen of our soule▪ and herunto sayth Iohn̄ in his Apocalipse:Apoc. 3. D. Collirio unge oculos tuos vt videas. Anoynte the yene of thy soule with the blode of Christe that thou myghtest se.Su{per} canti sermo. lxii. And saynt Barnarde sayth / There is nothynge of so great efficacitie and vertue to purge and quycken the syght of our soule / as is the continuall
and diligent remēbraunce of the woundes and passion of Christ.Pri. Cor. 2. A. And therfore sayd saynt Paule: Non iudicaui me scire aliquid in∣ter vos: nisi Iesum Christum et hunc crucifixum. I iudged & thoght my selfe to knowe nothynge but Iesus Christe crucifyed. So saynt Laurence by the signe of ye crosse dyd gyue syght vnto them that were blynde / and so cōuerted them vnto the light of the faith.In legenda i{us}. ¶The meditation of the passion of Christe doth gyue vnto the remembrer thre maner of knowledges. Fyrst is the knowledge of god / for therby we knowe what mercy and charitie he hath to vs, Secondly: therby we knowe ourselfe / for by it we se mani∣festlie of what dignytie and howe precious our soules be in the syght of god sithe that our sauiour Iesu god and man wolde put hym selfe to the deth for to redeme our soules. The thyrde know¦ledge is of synne / for therby we knowe moste manifestlie howe moche god the father dyd hate synne / syth for the destruction ther∣of he wolde nat spare his natural and onely sonne / but gaue hym to the dethe for to destroy synne. ¶The .x. profit. Iustorum letificat mortalitatem. IT maketh a man redy and glade to dye.Salath. vi. D. And therfore saint Paule bearynge the signes and tokens of the woundes of our lorde Iesu Christe in his bodye sayde: Cupio dissolui et esse cum Christo: mihi viuire Christus est et mori lucrum.Philip. 1. C. D. I couit to be dissolued and separate from this bodye / and so to be with Christ. I lyue here in Christe / and for to magnifie Christe / and to dye / it shuld be great auauntage and profit to me.In legenda i{us}. So saynt Andrew went gladly to the dethe of the crosse / saynge: Hayle holy crosse take me from the compaigney of mortal men / and rendre or gyue me to my maister Christe that he by the / myght receyue me / that by the bought and redemed me. Also I rede how that a certen pa¦gane and tyrante meruaylynge how that the Christians myght suffer so great tormentes and paynes and why they went so glad¦ly vnto the deth? It was answered to hym by the brother of saynt Victor / howe that they haue the remembraunce of the passion of Christe imprinted in theyr hert / and therfore remēbryng what he suffred for them / they with great gladnes suffer all paynes & deth for his name and loue. And the iudge heryng this answere / com¦maūded to put hym to deth / and after that his bodye to be opened and his hert drawen out / and so to be kut and deuided / and ther∣in they founde the forme and shappe of the crosse and the crucifix most subtilie and curiously made of synewes and vaynes.
¶The .xi. profit. Lesorum reconsiliat contrarietatem. THe meditation of the passion of Christ reconsileth enemis and induceth a man to the loue of god and of his neghbor.Iohīs. xii. E. And so our lorde sayde in the gospell: Si exaltatus ueo a terra: omnia traham ad meipsum. If I be exalted from the erth (signi∣fienge therby his crucifieng) I shall drawe all thynges vnto me by my loue.Colos. 1. C. Also saynt Paule sayth: Pacificans per sanguinem crucis: siue que in terris: siue que in celis sunt. He dyd reconsile and pacifie by his blode that he shedde on the crosse / both those thyng{is} that were in erth and those that were in heuens. He that feruent∣ly remēbreth the passion of Christe / is all drawen in to the loue of god and in to the loue of his neighbor. And therfore saynt Bar∣nard saith:Ser. xx. su{per} cautica. O swete Iesu / the cuppe of passion that thou dranke for vs / doth cause the to be loued of vs aboue all thyng{is}. There is nothynge that moueth vs so moche to the loue of god / as the pas∣sion of Christe / in the whiche he more laboured and suffred more payne / and had more contradiction then in the creation of all the worlde. For in his passion and the acte of our redemption some dyd contrarie hym in his wordes / some dyd ley in a wayt to take hym with a defaut in his actes & dedes / some dyd scorne & mocke hym in his tormentes and paynes / and some dyd rebuke hym on the crosse at his dethe. Wherfore who so euer feruently doth re∣membre this passion of Christ / is drawen and reuysshed vnto the loue of Christe god & man / and so cōsequently he is drawen vnto the loue of his neighbor / for ye one can nat be had without ye other. ¶The .xii. profit. Meritorum recompensat exiguitatem. IT also encreaseth our merites / herunto speaketh saynt Aus¦ten saynge:In manua∣li. ca. xxi. What so euer grace of merites or goodnes that I want / I do vsurpe and take it vnto my comforth of the woun∣des of my sauiour Iesu Christe / for great mercy flowethe from hym / nor theyr wanteth no conduites: by the whiche they may flowe vnto me. Those pypes and conduites ben the woundes of my sauiour Christe / whiche be full of mercy / ful of pitie / swet∣nes and charitie. And hereof we may perceyue fyrst / that this meditation suppleyth in vs that grace and those good meritori∣ous dedes / whiche other wyse we be negligent to laboure for. ¶Secondely it may appere that there is no penaunce / that may be compared to this inwarde and feruente meditation.
And therfore sayth that greate lerned doctor Albertus Magnus: that this meditation is more profitable / than that a man shulde fast one hole yere in breade and water / or that euery day by one hole yere he shulde say one hole Dauid psalter / or if he shulde dis∣cipline and scourge hym selfe euery day vnto the effusion of his blode. And no meruayll / for without the passion of Christe / all our actes and dedes ben vnprofitable / as sayth the mayster of the sentence: Distinc. 16. libro tertio. ¶The .xiii. profit. Nocumētorum fugat inopinabilitatem. THis meditation of the passion of Christe doth preserue a man from many perylles that may come sodenly before we haue any consideration or knowledge of them. Herunto it is writen in the Apocalipse: that our lorde cōmaunded by his aun∣gell to certen aungelles / to whom he had gyuen in cōmaundmēt to trouble and punisshe the people of the world / saynge:Apoc̄. 4. A. Nolite nocere terre et mari ne{que} arboribus: quoadus{que} signemus seruos dei nostri in frontibus eorum. Noy nat nor hurte the erth nor the see / ne yet the trees / vnto suche tyme we haue marked the seruauntes of our lorde god in theyr forheedes: that is with the signe of the crosse / and that we do by the meditation of the passion of Christe. In figure herof the aungell that dyd kyl and sley the fyrst gotten both of man and of beest thoroughout all Egipte / dyd spare and saue hermles the Iues:Exodi. xii. D. whose houses or postes of theyr doores were sprynkeled with the blode of the lambe.Capi. iii. Also saynt Gregory in his second boke of his Dialog{is} sheweth yt when one certen ma¦licious person purposing to poison saint Benedict: dyd gyue vn∣to hym wyne mixted with poyson / he made the signe of the crosse and anone the cuppe brake in to pecys / and so escaped the peryll of deth / thoroughe the vertue of the crosse. ¶The .xiiii. profit. Orthodoxorum speificat timiditatem. IT also gyueth great hope and truste vnto faythfull people And herunto saynt Barnarde expounynge these wordes of the canticle:Ser. lx. su{per} canti canti co{rum}. 2. D. In foraminibus petre. sayth thus: I shall speke these thynges / I shall sure abyde and rest in the hooles of the stone / that is in the woundes of my sauiour / for I haue set my feet sure∣vpon that stone / though the worlde frowne and be troubled with me / and the flesshe or sensualitie stryue agaynst me / and also the
deuyll ley in await of me: I shall nat fall / for I haue set my fete and affection or loue vpon a sure stone / I haue offendyd in a gre∣uouse and dampnable synne / my soule therby shall be troubled or vexed / but it shal nat be vtterly cast downe by dispaire: for I shal remembre the woūdes of my sauyour Iesu / for he was wounded for my synnes.In manua∣li. ca. xxiii. Also saint Austin sayeth / Longius opened the side and herte of my sauiour Iesu for me / that I myght entre therein. And I haue entred therin and do rest there surely & quietly. The nayles and the spere do call & crye vnto me / that I may be truely reconsiled vnto Christe: yf that I wyll loue hym. ¶The .xv. profite. Peccatorum aduocat viuacitatem. THis meditacion induceth and bryngeth to man the grace of god / whiche is the lyfe of the soule / and therefore saynte Bernard sayeth. As ofte as that person that deuoutely remēbreth the passion of Christe breeth & receyueth brethe agayne: so ofte he receyueth a new gyft of grace / and grace is the life of the soule. Phisiciens don say that whan a sicke man wepyth: it is a signe & token of lyfe. So whan a synner wepyth for cōpassion of the pas∣sion of our lorde: it is a signe of the lyfe of grace and quickenes of the soule. And therfore sayeth the prophete Hieremy in his la∣mentacions.Tren̄. 4. D. Spiritus oris nostri xs dominus captus est in peca∣tis nostris, cui dicimus. In vmbra tua viuemus. Our lorde Christe the spirite of our mouthe (that is to saye / the spirite whereby our soule liueth / lyke as the body liueth by the ayre or brethe receiued at the mouthe) This spirite Christe (I say) giuynge lyfe vnto the soule: is taken in our synnes / that is / he suffred payne & dethe for our synnes. We shall lyue in his shadow / that is / we shal haue the lyfe of grace thrughe the deuout & feruent remembraunce of that his dethe and passion.Mat. 27. F. And so Christe by his blessid passion doeth gyue the lyfe of nature / the lyfe of grace / & the lyfe of glory. Fyrste I say he giueth the lyfe of nature / for dede men after his passion & resurrection dyd ryse vnto lyfe agayne / & appered vnto many in Hierusalem. Secondly he giueth the lyfe of grace / for many after his passion were conuerted vnto the faythe. And he gyueth also the lyfe of glory / as it well appered in the thefe / to whom he sayd (whā he was fast nayled on the crosse) Hodie mecū eris ī paradiso,Luce. 23. F. This day shalt thou be with me in glory.In ser. pri. in die sanc Andree. Also hereunto speketh saynt Bernarde / sayenge. The tree of the crosse (yf there be any man that wyll gader it by feruent meditacion) doeth burgyn and
brynge furth lyfe / it fructifieth ioy & gladnes / it droppeth oile of confort / & it sweteth the balme of spiritual grac{is}. This tree of life is no wilde & vnfruitfull tree,Ser. lxxiiii. de t{per}e. E. to them yt wyll gader it. Also saint Austin sayth:Itē ser. xix. de . H. The blood of the phisicien is shed to make a mede¦cin for the mad & sicke soule. The soule & spouse of Christe, sayth in the canticles:Canti. 2. A. Sub vmbra illi{us} quē desideraui: sedi et fruct{us} eius dulcis gutturi meo. I haue sittten & restyd vnder ye shadow of him in whom is all my desyre & confort / & his fruit is swete & pleasaūt vnto my taste. For who so euer doeth sauourly taste of the fruit of the crosse: all carnall pleasure shal be vnsauoury to hym. ¶The .xvi. profite. Quassatorum mitigat aduersitatem. THis meditacion of the passion of Christ, doeth mitigate & swage all tribulacions / & doeth giue pacience in all aduer¦sities / & so maketh vs quiet.Hebr. 12. A. Herunto speketh saint Paule / sayng: Recogitate eū qui talē sustinuit a ptōrib{us} cōtradictionē aduers{us} se∣metipsū, vt non fatige mini animis vestris deficiētes. Remēbre hym that suffred great contradiction of synners against him selfe / that is / suche rebukes / slaunderous wordes / & at last moost painefull deth / that ye by suche remembraūce shuld nat faynt in your myn∣des whan ye suffre aduersities. As yf he shulde saye; ye can nat faynte or be ouercom in your tribulacions, yf ye haue the deuout remembraunce of his paines & passion.Au. 1. lib. de cōflu. virtu tū et vitio∣tū ca. ix. And this approueth saint Austin / sayenge: There is nothynge so harde or painfull: but yt it may be easely borne, yf the passion of Christe be quicke & feruēt in our myndes. And this is ye reason herof (for the lesse passion or payne is nat perceyued, or at leest it is nat regarded: where as ye more greuous payn or passion is felt, or doeth occupy the minde of man. And therefore Auicenna sayeth / that suche persones as be in feruent agues or axes, doeth nat fele or perceiue the apostume. And so the passion of Christe, yf it be feruētly remembred: it put∣teth away all worldly tribulacion. For lyke as wyne (thoughe it be sumwhat stronge & sharpe of it selfe) yf it be myxte with suger and other spyces / or be put in the potecarye spiced bagge, & so go thrugh it: it is made moost dulce & pleasant: So the tribulaciōs of this worlde / yf they be ioyned & mixte with the remembraunce of the passion of Christe, they be moche pleasant & confortable to the soule. And therfore our lorde sayeth vnto his spouse the soule in his canticles:Cātic. . A. Dabo tibi poculum ex vino condito. I shall gyue to the Ipocras for thy drynke / that is wyne made pleasaunt with
spices. And this signifieth ye wine of worldly tribulaciō or aduer¦sitie / whā it is ioyned & mixte with the meditacion of ye passion of Christe.Primo ma∣cha. 6. D. Also we rede in ye boke of ye Machabeis / how that kyng Antiochus, whan he shuld fight against the Iues: he shewed vn∣to his Olephantes & put in theyr sight the blood / that is the red co¦lour & licour of the grape & of ye molbery / to thintent yt those Ole∣phantes shulde be prouoked to fight, & to be the more quicke in ba¦taile. In lyke maner the knight{is} of Christe, accordyng to thexam¦ple of these Olephant{is}, shuld be animate & quickened to suffre pa∣ciently all tribulaciōs & aduersities, whan so euer they here, se, or remembre the blood & passion of Christe / whiche was pressed out of his body at his passion: as ye wyne is pressed out of the grape. Moreouer the prophet Hieremy sayeth:Tren̄. 3. G. Dabis eis scutum cordis laborem tuum. Thou (good lorde) shal gyue vnto them a buckeler or a shelde for theyr hert or soule / yt is thy labour, passion, or deth. This buckler or shelde receiueth without any perill vnto ye soule, al maner of dartes / & specially .iii. maner of dartes / that is, losse of goodes, infirmities of the body, and contumeliouse or rebukyng worde, with this buckeler (that is with the feruent meditacion of ye labour & paine or passion of Christe) a man ouercūmeth almigh¦ty god in paciently suffryng his corrections & louyng visitatiōs. He also ouercūmeth the deuyll, in auoidyng his snares & tempta∣ciōs. And thyrdly he ouercūmeth him selfe in resistyng all carnall mociōs & passiōs of yre or wrath / & in paciently suffering all infir∣mities of the body. And thus the remembraunce of the passion of Christ doth mitigate thaduersities & troubles of suche as be trou¦bled therwith. And as ye se yt a litle floode or ryuer doeth lose his name whā he is entred into ye see or into a greater water: so I like maner al labours, paines, & passiōs, cōpared to ye labours, paines & passion of Christe, lese theyr name, & be nat to be called paines. ¶The .xviii. profite. Rectorū confirmat stabilitatem. THe meditacion of ye passion of Christe, maketh rightuouse & good men stable in faith & in good werkes.In poliro. li. o. ca. 35. We rede that there is a certayn welle in Englande of this nature / that yf a tree be put therin, & continue there any long space or tyme: it is tour¦ned into a stone: So spiritually, if a christian continue longe in this welle yt is in the remēbraūce of the woūdes & dethe of christe, he shal be tourned into a stone / that is / he shal be constant & stable in all vertue & goodnes, for thā he shal abide fastened with christe
vnto ye crosse by pacience.In stimulo amoris lib. pri. Capi. 1. Herunto sayth saint Bonauenture: O meruelous deth & passion of Christe, whiche doeth allienate & se∣clude the remembrer from dethe spūall & also eternall / & nat only that: but also it maketh him angelicall: & nothyng els to consider & thynke, but Iesu Christe crucified. He wyl bere his crosse with Christe: & so he bereth in his hert Iesu Christe, who cōteineth in his hāde & power bothe heuyn & erthe. And so for ye loue of Christ he shal bere most easely & suffre paciētly al troubles & paines. He wold be crowned with thornes with Christe & for christ: & christ shal crowne hym with the crowne of glory / and so, as ye may per¦ceyue, suche a feruent meditacion of the passion of Christe, doeth greatly stable vs in goodnes. ¶The .xviii. profite. Supernovum Placat displicentiam. THis meditacion doeth strongly swage & pacify ye wrath & displeasure of god & al his saint{is}.Su{per} cantiē sermo. 43. Herunto saith saint Ber¦nard: The remēbraūce of ye labours & paines of my sauiour Iesu doeth erect & strēgth me in al aduersities / it doth represse me and kepe me ī al {pro}sperites / & it also gydeth or ledeth me by a sure way in this lyfe / where as is now ioy, now sorow, now pleasur, now payne. &c. This meditacion putteth away all peryls. It reconsi∣leth me to ye high iudge of ye worlde, whyles it declareth vnto me hym to be very meke & mylde here in erthe / to whose maiesty all aūgels in heuen do reuerence, & haue him in reuerent feare. Also the same saint entraytyng these wordes of Iob.Iob. vi. A. Vtinā appēderen tur petā mea quib{us} irā merui▪ &c,In serm de passd. saieth thus: Good lorde, behold ye face of thy son christe / whiche was obedient to thy wyll vnto his dethe / & (good lorde) let neuer ye printes of his woūdes depart frō thy sight & remēbraūce. Cōsider (good lord) what satisfaction he hath done for our synnes to reconsyle vs vnto the. I wold that thou (god lorde) wold wey and pondre our synnes in a balance with the paynes that thy innocent sonne Iesus suffered for them. And then (good lorde) it shulde well appere that his paynes ex∣cedeth our synnes / so that thou rather shewe thy mercy vnto vs for the merytes of his passyon / then to kepe our synnes in thy remembraunce to reuenge and punysshe them. ¶The .xix, profit. Terrenorum pessundat vanitatem. IT also maketh man to contempne and set at nought the worlde with all the pleasures therof.Gal. vi. D. And therfore saynt Paule sayde. Mihi mundus crucifixus est et ego mundo. The
worlde is crucified to me: and I to the worlde / as if he sayd: I dispise the worlde and the worlde dispiseth me. Auicen reciteth how that a certen man by stronge ymaginacion that he had yma¦ginynge him selfe to be a leprouse man: therby he was made a le∣prouse man: So in lyke maner, yf a man feruently & deuoutly cō¦tinue in the remēbraūce of the passion of Christe: he may so haue a great sorow in his hert, & true cōpassion of ye passion of Christe, & so suffre payn with hym / & so consequently al Worldly pleasure shall be bytter & paynfull vnto hym.In stimulo amoris lib. mo. ca. 9. Herunto sayeth saynt Bona∣uenture. Who so feruently remēbreth the passion of Christe, he de¦syreth to be crucified with Christe Iesu / he reputeth & thynketh hym selfe to be in seruitude, bondage, & misery / he doth sygh & so∣row / & is in continuall heuynes, vnto ye tyme he be all to wasshed or drowned in the blood of Christe / & so trāsfourmed into his lord crucified / & yf he be nat kept in the blood of his sauiour, he thyn∣keth him selfe no man / yea worse thā a beast, yf he be nat clad with the passion of Christe. Therefore, who so euer doeth ofte and fer∣uently remembre the passion of Christe, he shall lytle regarde the vanities of this worlde, and set them at nought. ¶The .xx. profite. Viatorum gubernat prosperitatē. THe meditacion of the passyon of Christe doeth gouerne & direct men lyuyng in this worlde, vnto the lyfe of eternall felicitie. For the passion of Christe, is the kynges hygh waye / the right & compendiouse waye to cum to the kyngdom of god in he∣uyn. And therfore our lorde sayeth: Ego sum via, veritas, et vita. I am the way,Ioh. 14. A. the truth, & the life eternall. And in an other place he sayeth: As Moyses dyd exalt & set vp a brasen serpent in ye wil¦dernes,Ioh. 3. B. to thintent yt who so behelde that serpent, shuld be deliue¦red from the venimons stingyng of ye burnyng serpent:Num̄. 21. C so it was cōueniēt & necessary for our saluacion, yt the son of a vyrgin shuld be exalted vpon the crosse / yt who so euer wold beholde him with true formed fayth, shulde nat peryssh: but haue euerlastyng lyfe / & that this lyfe shulde be gyuen to vs: Christ suffred his passion. And saint Austin sayeth:Su{per} Iob. tractat. 12. As thoo persons that beheld the brasen serpent set vpon a pole in the wildernes by Moyses, were deliue¦red from peryll of deth (as we sayd before) so now, who so euer be stynged or bytten by the suggestion or craft of the deuyll: let him beholde (with a faythfull affection) Christe hangynge vppon the crosse / & he shall haue cōfort / for there dethe was ouercum & slayn / but our sauiour Christe doeth lyue, & euer shall lyue. But that he
myght ouercum dethe, he was clad with dethe for a lyttle tyme. Deathe myght neuer be ouercum, but by lyfe. And who is this lyfe, but our sauiour Christe? And so by his deathe we all haue lyfe.Numer. 35. D. This was well fygured in the olde testament: where as it is sayd, that suche as were banysshed from theyr cities: shulde retourne agayne to theyr inheritaunce after the dethe of the high preest or Bishop / and nat afore: So the faythfull people of god, banysshed frō theyr inheritaunce, the kyngdom of glory: myght nat cum thereunto agayne, vnto the dethe of Christe our hyghe Bysshop. But now by the merites of his passion, and the remem¦braunce therof: we that ben exyled in this vale of misery and tea∣res, may freely entre into the kyngedome of heuyn / and possesse that glory promysed vnto vs. And hereunto sayeth saynt Austin: We be called by the merytes of the dethe and passion of our rede∣mer Iesu Christe, frō the darkenes, vnto lyght / from dethe, vnto lyfe / from corrupcion, to incorrupcion / from our exyle and ba∣nysshement, vnto our cuntrey and inherytaunce / from sorow, to ioye / and from this worlde, vnto heuyn. And therefore our sa∣uyour Christe / for that he myght exalte and lyfte vs vp to the glo¦ry of heuyn: he in a maner put hym in one scale or one parte of the balaunce, and vs in the other. He put hym selfe to moost payne∣full and shamefull dethe / and vs in the merites of his vertuouse lyfe and dethe. And so he drewe his balaunce so lowe / that is, by mekenes and paynes sufferyng, he descended so low, that he lyf∣ted vp all his electe people vnto heuyn. And hereunto our lorde sayeth:Ioh. 12. E. Ego si exaltatus fuero a terra: omnia traham ad me ipsum. If I be exalted from the erthe, from all worldly pleasures, and put vnto the payne of the crosse / ascendynge it as my chiefe pal∣fray to fyght agaynst myne enemies / and so as a valiaunt knight subduynge theym vnder my fete, and ouercummynge all theyr myght and power: I shall draw vnto me by my charitie and pa∣cience, all myne electe people from all the partes of the worlde / where so euer they be, to reigne with me in glory for euermore. ¶In the passion of Christe is conteyned all perfection of all the orders of aungels. Seconde Chapiter.
IN the most blessed passion of Christ is conteyned all perfection, fayrnes, and beauty of all the blessyd spi¦rites and aungels in heuyn. Fyrst & aboue all other doeth apere in Christe that burnyng loue / attribute and assigned to the highest order of aungels / called Seraphin. For there was neuer creature that had so highe cha∣ritie and burnynge loue, that therby wolde & dyd suffre so great & many paines, as our sauiour Iesu Christe dyd suffre for vs his moost vile seruauntes / or rather (I shulde say) his moost wicked & vnkynde enemies. Secondly, there was in hym thabundant & plenteouse cunnyng or knowledge of truthe, gyuen to ye seconde order of aūgels, called Cherubin. And this maner of knowledge is nat onely in Christe: but also there is nothyng in this worlde that so moche doeth helpe to the true knowledge of scrypture / no¦thynge so moche doeth allecte and moue man to the contemplaci∣on of heuenly thynges / nothynge so muche doeth illuminate and lyghten the soule to know and haue sauour or pleasure in god, as doeth the passion of Iesu Christe: for in it, and by it, is founde the fulnes of true knowledge / as we shall declare to you hereaf∣ter. Thyrdely, there shyneth in this passion, specially towar∣des the eterne maiesty of god, the reuerence, attributed or assig∣ned to the thyrd order of aungels, named Thronys. For as those spyrytes be called Thronys, for asmuche as it is sayde that god restyth and sytteth in them as in his seet or Throne, for the reue∣rence that they haue vnto his diuine maiestye / for he restyth (as the prophet sayeth) vpon the meke persons,Esa. 66. A. and vpon them that reuerently feryth & kepyth his commaundementes: So it may be sayd that almighty god sytteth and restyth in this most blessed passion, as in his Throne / for therein appered the moost excel∣lent humilitie, humanitie, veneracion, and reuerence of Christe, vnto the diuine & eterne maiestie. Fourthly in this blessyd passi¦on shyneth the high dignitie of presidencie or dominion, attribu∣ted to the fourth order of aūgels, called Dominaciōs. For Christ dyd meke hym selfe, & was obedient vnto the dethe / & that vnto ye moost shamefull dethe of the crosse. For the whiche mekenes god dyd exalt hym to great presidēcie & dominion / & gaue vnto hym a name aboue all names / as saynt Paule sayeth.Phil. 2. B. Fyftely, in this blessed passion apereth the great power & strength of ye fyft order of aūgels, called powers. For christ most victoriously by his bles¦sed passion hath subdued the great power of the deuyll / of whom Iob sayeth,Iob. 41. D. that there is no power vpon the erthe, yt may be com¦pared
vnto his power / but Christe by his passiō & dethe ouercam all his power / as we sayd before. Sixtly, in this passion shyneth the mighty operacion of the vertues that be named the syrt order of aungels. For there Christe shewed his vertue / whiche dyd pe∣netrate, perce, & draw vnto his loue the hertes of all his elect peo¦ple.Ioh. 12. E. And therfore he said: Yf I be exalted from the erthe vpon the crosse: I shal draw vnto me all thinges / that is, all his elect peo∣ple. Wherfore yf any person haue true fayth into god, & loue god: let him nat ascribe that to his owne merites: but rather to the me¦rit{is} of the passion of Christ.Ioh. 6. E. For no man may cum to hym by true fayth & loue, except he be drawen by almighty god / by his grace / and this grace we haue by the merites of the passion of Christe. In this passion also is cōteyned the kyngdom of the principates / yt be the .vii. order of aungels. For as the prophet sayth: Fact{us} est principatus super humerum eius:Esay. 9. B. His principalitie & kyngdom is made vpon his sholder / that is, in that he bare the crosse & suffred the paines & dethe of the crosse: he gat his kyngdom / & so bought it for vs / that is the kyngedome of heuyn. Also in the passion of Christe apereth the releuacion of archangels / that be the .viii. or∣der. For by the passyon of Christe we were sufficiently releuyd & deliuered a pena et culpa / that is, both from synne, & frō payn due for synne. But now, yf we synne actually after our baptisme: it is conuenient yt we suffre payne temporall for our synne / though thrugh the vertue of ye sacramentes of the chyrch, theternall payn be cōmuted into temporall payne. And therfore our lorde sayeth: Date eleemosinā,Luce. 11. F. & ecce oīa mūda sūt vobis: Gyue almose, and all thynges shalbe clensed in you. In this passion also shineth the re¦uelacion and manifest doctryne & teachynge of aungels / that be called the nynthe order. For all the hyd secretes of scripture, & all the secret misteries of god, were reueled & made open by the passi¦on of Christe,Ma. 27. F. & openynge of his herte with the spere. And in to∣ken hereof, at the passion of Christe, the veile of the temple was broken or diuided into two partes / that all the thyng{is} that before were secret & hyd in the inner sacrate temple, might be open and manifestly sene. And thus by these forsayd conformities whiche the passion of Christe hath with the orders of aungels, it is done most conueniently yt nat onely Christe shuld redeme mankynde: but also that he shulde mooste ordinately order, dispose, & repare the ruyne & fall of aungels. For by the great loue & charity which he had in the crosse, he kindled the fyre of loue in the hertes of his electe people towardes god and theyr neyghbours / that suche as
folowed and duely executed that feruent loue: were made and yet be made apte to repare the moste hyghe ordre called Sera∣phin. By the true knowledge expressed in that blessed passyon were his electe people illuminate to the hyghe contemplacyon of the knowledge of god and hyghe misteryes / that so they may be apte to the reparacyon of the seconde ordre: called Cherubym. Agayne for his great meaknes and reuerence that Christ had in his blyssed passion towardes the hyghe maiestie of god / his e∣lecte people were prouoked to lyke meaknes and reuerence and due honoure to be rendred to the hyghe maiestie of god / as fare fourthe as theyr frayle nature wolde serue them / and so to be apte to ye reparcyon of thordre called: Thrones. Morouer thorough the example of his great pacyence and obedience vnto the dethe of the crosse / for the whiche he was exalted of god, as we sayde before / he prouoked his electe people to ouercome all vices and concupiscence by labour / abstinence and affliccions / and to sub∣due all inordinate appetites vnto reason / that no vayne / or inor∣dinate thynge shulde haue any domynacyon in them / that so they myght be made apte to the reparation of the ordre called: Domi∣nationes. And so who so euer humbleth hymselfe: shalbe exal∣ted. And so truely to passe ouer all the residue of thordres of aun¦gelles / our sauiour Christe in his blyssed passion gaue example vnto his seruauntes to resist and ouercome the suggestyons and temptacyons of the deuyll: that they myght be apte to the repa∣racion of the Potestates. Also he gaue vnto them exāple of good conuersacion and vertuous operacions / that they myght ascend to the ordre of Vertues. He gaue them also example so to directe and gouerne theyr outwarde senses and inwarde mocyons / and all other thynges that be vnder theyr cure that they might ascend vnto the Principates. Morouer he gaue them example so to re∣leue and comforthe the nede and necessities of other persons that be in nede / that they myght ascende vnto the Archaūgelles. And lest he gaue them example so to instruct and teache the ignorant / that they myght be apte to ascende vnto the ordre of Aūgelles. ¶In the passion of Christe is also conteyned the beatitude of men. Chaptre .iii. IT may be declayrede that the true beatytude and blysse or ioye of men is conteyned in the passion of Christe: by the same reasons wherby we haue nowe declared that the beautye and perfeccyon of aungelles done shyne in the sayde passyon. For to that cleare knoweledge of treuthe whiche appeared in
that blissed passion, as we sayd afore in thorder of Cherubin: cor¦respondeth ye open & clere vision of ye godhed, yt thelect people of god shall haue in heuyn to saciate & beatitie the reasonable or in∣tellectable power of the soule. Secondly to yt profoūde mekenes & reuerence, wherby we sayd that the passion of Christe hathe the perfection of the order of the thrones: correspondeth the surety of blysse / wherewith the wrathfull power of ye soule (comonly called Vis irascibilis) is saciate. For on whom shall rest & continue ye spi∣rite & glory of god: but vpon the meke person? Thyrdely to that excellent charitie yt was shewed at the passion of Christe: corres∣pondeth theternall fruicion & loue of the deitie / wherwith ye wyll & reasonable appetite of man shal be fulfilled / and this for the bea∣titude of the soule. Now for the .iiii. dowries of the glorified bo∣dy. Fyrst to that high dignitie of presidencie yt our lorde had by his sufferaūce & obediēce vnto ye deth / for ye which he was exalted to hygh dignity: correspondeth in ye glorified body agility / wher¦by he may do what he will. Secondly, to yt great power & strēgth wherby our sauiour ouercam dethe: correspondeth impassibili∣tie / that is, yt the glorified body shall suffre no payne. Thyrdly, to that mighty operacion of vertue, whereby he drew all thynges to him self: correspondeth subtility / wherby the glorified body may penetrate all thynges. Fourthly, to that noblenes or principality for ye whiche the prophet said of Christe:Esay. 9. B. Fact{us} est pricipat{us} su{per} hu¦merū ei{us}. His principalitie or noblenes is made vpō his shulder / & also of this noblenes or clerenes is sayd in the gospell / where as christ said to his father:Ioh. 17. A. Pater clarifica filiū tuū. Father clarify thy son / or make knowē the noblenes of thy son. To this noblenes (I say) correspōdeth ye fourth dowry of thy glorified body, called cle∣renes / for thā our bodies shal be clere, & shyne as ye son / & so sayeth our lorde in ye gospel:Mat. 13. F. Tūc iusti fulgebūt sicut sol ī regno patris eorū. Than after ye generall resurrectiō, ye rightuouse mē shalbe clere, & shyne as ye son in ye kyngedom of theyr father. Furthermore to the office & {per}fectiō of archaugels & aūgels / which (as we said before) were shewed in ye passiō of criste: correspōdeth the beauty or acci¦dētall glory called ī latin Aureola / a circle or a litle crowne / which is a special ioy of ye soule giuē to mā for sum excellēt act don ī this life / & it is only giuē to martirs for their martirdō / to virgins, for virginite kept for ye loue of god / & to doctors or prechers, for theyr tethyng ye truthe of god. And thus it apereth manifestly how yt in the blessyd passiō of Christe doth shine (as in a most pure glas) all the beatitude of man / & all the plentiousnes of grace & glorye. All
glory (I say) that is bothe thessenciall glory of the soule that con∣sisteth in the vision / tencion / or surety / & fruicion of the deity that ben called the .iii. dowries of the soule. And also the consubstanci∣all glory / that is the .iiii. dowries of the body, & also the acciden∣tall glory. Wherfore sithe in Christes passion is thexcellent mani¦festacion or declaracion of his most high power / moost high wis∣dom / & most high goodnes: therfore this passiō is to all ye seruaū¦tes of god, a mater & cause of moost excellent ioy & gladnes. And therfore though men ioy consideryng them selfe to be redemed by this glorious passion, & haue great profite therby / & also aungels ioye, knowynge theyr ruine repared by the same passion / conside¦ryng this thynge as to theyr owne ioye & profite: Yet I beleue, & so it is, that both aungels & men do more ioye & be glad without comparison / referryng all these thynges to god / and hoolly or all to gyder extendynge theyr cogitacions & myndes to the glory of god: than they dyd considerynge theyr owne glory & profite that they haue by the sayd passion. Moreouer, as here appereth the most high & inestimable charite & shewing of the goodnes of god outwardely, to the great confort of aungell & man: so I beleue, & so it is, that bothe aūgell & man in theyr moost excellent & full ma¦ner don shew their loue with great ioy & gladnes, glorifieng and praysyng and louyng god for that excellent gifte eternally with∣out ende in glory. ¶In this passion also doeth shyne the vertues theologicall / the giftes of the holy goost / the beatitudes of the gospell / & also the fruites of the spirite. The .iiii. Chapiter. FYrst in this passion appere the vertues theologicall. For this passion of our lorde is ye strēgth & foūdaciō of all christen faith. It is therection & reysynge vp of our hope / & also it is thinflamacion & kyndelynge of our loue & charity / for here he dyd offre hym selfe for vs. Secōdly in this passion don shine as in a glasse the giftes of the holy goost / the gift of wisdom & vnderstandyng / ye gyft of coū¦cell & strength / of science / of pitie / & also of the feare of god / of the whiche we shall speke herafter in dyuerse & singuler chapiters. Thirdly, in this passion don appere ye .viii. beatitud{is} / for this pas¦sion is theyr foūtayn & begynnyng / theyr allectiue & exemplar. Who may be called so pore in spirite as Christ yt hyng naked vpō the crosse? Who may be named so mylde as Christ / the which as a milde lābe was led vnto the deth / & whā he was scourged, bet, buf¦feted, scorned, & falsly slaūdered, wolde nat ones open his mouthe
to contrary them. Who was so mournyng as he Whiche with te∣res and a loude mournynge voice prayed for his enemies? and he for his reuerence (as saynt Paule sayeth) was herde of god.Hebr. 5. C. But than he more mourned our synnes: than his owne payne / as we shall shew hereafter. He had more compassion of vs, than of hym selfe. Who fardermore do so moche hunger and thurst iustice, as Christe / whiche by the payne of the crosse dyd satisfye for our syn∣nes / and so dyd reconsile vs vnto his father / hungeryng and thyr stynge the helthe and saluacion of our soules.Ioh. 19. F. And in token herof he sayd, hangynge vpon the crosse Sitio / I thyrste, and desyre the helth of mannes soule. Who also was so mercifull as Christe, the very true samaritane?Luce. 10. F. the which (where as the preest and Leuite passed by the wounded men, nat regardynge hym) wasshed his woundes with wyne, and anointed them with oile / byndyng vp his woundes / and layeng the wounded man vpon his best / that is vpon his owne body / suffryng deth for our sinnes / & so led him vnto thostry of holy chirch &c. And where (I pray you) was there so muche puritie and clennes of herte,Apoca. 1. B as in Christe, which as an innocent lambe was offred vpon the crosse for vs / wasshyng and clensynge our vnclene & synfull hertes with his precyous blood? And who also was so peaceful as Christe / whiche was our peace and corner stone,Ephe. 2. D. ioynynge into one people of god / the Iues and the Gentiles / whiche also by his passion dyd pacify vs vnto god in his bloode. Moreouer, who so verely suffered persecucion for iustice as Christe, which for his iustice that he preached and she∣wed vnto the Iues, was crucified? & truely he myght well be cal∣led blessed / for the worldly and deuelysshe people, cursed hym or spake euyll of hym / and made many false lyes and slaunders of hym. These be the .viii. beatitudes the whiche Christe taught in the gospell / and gaue vs example in his owne persone how we shuld fulfyll them.Math. 5. A Fourthely in the passion of Christe don clere∣ly appere the .xii. fruites of the spirite: Of the which saint Paule sayth.Gala. 5. D Fructus spiritus est charitas, gaudium. &c. The fruites of the spirite, ben these / charitie, ioye, peace, paciēce, lōganimitie, good∣nes, benignitie, mildenes or gentilnes, fayth. For in this passion restyth the foundacion and strength of our faith, as concernynge his obiecte or subiect. It foloweth in the wordes of saint Paule / continence, good maners, and chastitie. All these do manifestly shyne in this passion, dethe, and crosse of Christe / as we shall de∣clare more at large hereafter. And therefore it conueniently folo∣weth in saynt Paule.Ibidem. Qui christi sunt: carnem suam crufixerunt cū
viciis et concupiscentiis. Who so be the childeren of Christe: they do cruisy and subdue theyr bodies, and also all vices and inordi∣nate concupiscence. This sayd saynt Paule, to shewe manifestly vnto vs that these .xii. fruites do hange vpon the moost holy tree of the crosse / & suche persones do take & gader them there: whiche conforme them self vnto Christe crucified: For by vertuouse ope∣racions in folowynge the lyfe and pacience of our sauiour Iesu Christe: men be made vertuouse / for suche beholde the lyfe and dethe of our lorde with diligence / remembre it by ofte and feruent meditacion / and also haue pleasure therein / and folow it as theyr frailtie wyll suffre them. And so they be made apte to the repara∣cion of thorder of vertues / as we sayd before / and shall say more hereafter. ¶By the passion of Christe we haue the effica∣citie and vertue of all spirituall goodnes. The fyfte Chapiter. BY the fruitfull and gloryouse passion of Christ, there is ministred vnto vs habundantly the matter of all spirituall goodes. For where is or shulde be our glo¦riacion or reioicynge / our hope and gladnes, but in one Christe, most high and true goodnes, and in the moost preciouse treasure of his passion / from the whiche all the sa¦cramentes of the Christe receiue theyr vertue & efficacitie / which be to vs as a moost holsum medicyn agaynst all our spirituall se∣kenes. Also this moost blessyd passion is to vs as a key that ope∣neth to vs the secretes of holy scripture / whiche openeth:Apoc. 3. B. & no mā may than shyt it / and whan it shitteth: no man may than open it. Without Christ crucified & this key of his passion: it is impossi∣ble to vnderstande holy scripture. And this key feruently impryn¦ted in our mynde: all thynges be manifest / as yf they were in the clere lyght. For who so euer desyreth to cum or attayne vnto the knowledge of the godhed: he must ascende therunto by the man∣hode and passion of Christe, as by the kynges high waye / for by it he shall ascende by lyttle and lyttle vnto higher thynges / as I shall shew vnto you more playnly hereafter. For no man may at∣tayne to the high knowledge of the godhed / and to the great swe∣tenes and pleasure therein conteined: excepte he be fyrste dra∣wen vp with a feruent and godly affection of faythe and loue by the bytternes of the humanitie of Christe, that he suffered in his
passion / as ye shall perceiue hereafter. And the more that any man presumeth to ascende without this passion: the more deper shal he fall. For this is the onely way by the whiche we shulde as∣cende. This is the onely yate or entraunce vnto our mooste de∣syred ende. And briefely to speake / who so euer desyreth to haue eternall helthe, and the highe crowne of glorye / or wolde ascende to the perfection and highe toure of vertues / or wolde optayne knowledge and wysdome / or by pacyence / to stande strongely and euynly, as well in aduersytie as in prosperytie / or to walke the sure waye / or elles desyreth to taste of the bytternes of the pas∣sion of Christe / and drynke the mooste pleasaunt drynke of his consolacion: he must bere Iesu Christe / I say Iesu Christe cru∣cified in his soule and bodye, by continuall remembrance of his passion, and pacyent sufferaunce of all aduersities bothe corpo∣rall and spirituall / and also absteyne frome all other delectacion and consolacion. For surely, carnall consolacion, and the con∣templacyon of Christes passion, do neuer well accorde in one persone / for they be as contrarye bothe in name and in effecte. Nor the flesshe or sensualitie can haue pleasure in that thyng that deliteth the spirite.Gala. 5. C. For as saynte Paule sayeth / they be aduersa∣ries, & at continuall warre. But halas, there be many that whan they can nat fynde or get heuenly or spirituall consolacion: anon they searche and laboure for carnall or worldly conforte / and so they shytte theyr soules from the consolacion of god / and they rightuously want it. For it is very delicate / and nat gyuen vnto suche persones as wyll receiue any vaine consolacion. For yf the mynde or soule haue any thynge wherein it hathe pleasure out∣wardely: it shall remayne without inwarde pleasure. And con∣trary wyse / yf the spirituall delectacion be ones perfectly tasted: all carnall pleasure is made vnsauoury to that soule. Where∣fore, yf thou woldest haue spirituall conforte: laboure nat there∣fore with a double affection or desyre / for so thou makest thy selfe vnworthy to receiue that godly and spirituall conforte. And hereunto sayeth saynte Bernarde:In decla∣matio su{per} euāg. Ecce nos reliqui∣mus omnia in fine. He is vnworthy the heuenly benediction and conforte, that laboureth therefore with a dou∣ble affection or desyre. He laboureth with a double affection: that purposeth (yf he can nat get spirituall conforte) to laboure for vayne and transitorye pleasures or conforte. And so there∣fore he is vnworthy to receyue spirituall delectacion.Iosue. 5. C. An example or fygure hereof we rede in scrypture / how that after
the chylderen of Israell had ones tasted of the corne and fruytes of the lande of promission: the foode of aungels,Sapi. 16. C called Manna / and gyuen to them by god, was taken from them. By this Man∣na, whiche was very delycate, and had in it selfe all delectacion and pleasaunte taste of all maner of meates: is signified the swe∣tenes and conforte of Christe / whiche is taken frome religiouse persones, and from all Christians, after that they begyn to eate of the fruytes of the erthe / that is, after that they gyue them selfe to worldly and erthely delectacions or pleasures. And therefore the true seruaunt of god ought to say with the prophete Dauid: Renuit consolari anima mea,Psalm. 76. scilicet exterius. That is, my soule hathe refused all outwarde and vayne consolacion. And it folo∣weth:Richard. Memor fui dei, et delectatus sum. I remembred god, and I had great delectacion therein in all the powers of my soule. And hereunto sayeth one deuout Doctour: The vnderstandyng of man is neuer drawen perfitely vnto the contemplacion of he∣uenly thynges: excepte the body be fyrst strongely drawen from all superfluouse thynges, and all his pleasures. And hereunto ac¦cordeth saynt Gregory / sayenge: If we cut and take away from the body that whiche is to it pleasaunte: we shall shortely fynde that is delectable to the spyryte. And that shall well appere in them that conforme theyr lyfe vnto our sauyoure Iesu Christe / whose lyfe was all bytter and paynefull from the begynnyng vn∣to his dethe. And therefore our lorde dyd nat gyue vnto the Iues Manna: but in the deserte or wildernes / where as was no delec∣table meate to be had for theyr refresshynge and conforte. And so in lyke maner, the swetenes of grace and the taste of spirituall delectacion, is nat felt or perceyued but of them yt transpose & put them selfe into the deserte of theyr herte / that is, to repute thē selfe forsaken of all creatures, that they shulde nat fele or receyue any worldly or vaine delectacions. And therefore it is wrytten by the prophete:Psalm. 64. Pinguescent speciosa deserti et exultatione colles accin∣gentur. The pleasaunt places of ye deserte shall waxe fat / & the hil∣les shalbe compassed with ioye / yt is to say / those speciouse & plea∣sant places of desert / yt is, those {per}sons that make thē selfe deserte & forsaken of the world, so that the world cum nat tyll them / that is, moue them to any carnall, worldly, or vain pleasure & delectaciō / those persons (I say) waxe fat in godly deuocion & consolacion / & those hilles / yt is the hertes of them yt be fyxed in god: be cōpassed & set about with great ioye of heuenly confortes. And yt we shuld cum vnto this deserte:Mar. 6. D. our lorde moueth vs in ye gospell / sayenge
Venite seorsum in desertū locū, et requiescite pusillū: Cum ye into the desert or wildernes, and rest a lytle / that is, leue ye the plea∣sures of the worlde, and forsake them / and rest a lytle / that is, fer¦uently and deuoutely remembre our lordes payne and passion: & ye shal fynde rest & confort to your soules. For as our lorde sayeth in an other place:Ioh. 16. G. In mundo, pressuram habebitis: in me autem pa∣cem: Ye shall haue trouble & oppression in the worlde: but in me ye shal haue peace & rest.Mat. 14. B et. 15. D. Our lorde fed the people twise in ye wyl∣dernes / & nat in any other place. Also the Iues eat Manna in the wildernes, to signify that we can nat haue ye consolacion of god, but in the desert / that is, whan we forsake all worldly pleasures. Of this wildernes it is wryten by the prophet Esay / sayeng: Erit desertum Libanus in Charmel:Esay. 29. F et Charmel in saltum reputabitur. The desert or wood of Libane shalbe as the mount of Charmeli / & Charmel shal be reputed as a grene wood. Charmel{us} or Char∣mel, is as muche to say by interpretacion as a lābe / or tendernes. And it signifieth, that who so euer be in the spirituall deserte (of the whiche we spake of before) he shal perceiue the tendernes and paynes of our spirituall lambe Christe / and also receyue his deli∣tes and heuenly confortes / and so shall be grene and flourisshyng in all vertues and spirituall consolacions. ¶The seuen gyftes of the holy goost are conteyned in this pas∣sion / and thrugh the feruent remembraunce therof, they may be opteyned. And fyrste of the gyfte of feare of god. The syxte Chapitre. O My moost dere beloued brother / thou mayst behold in this most glorious passion of Christe (the whiche I am vnworthy to meane) seuen ascencions / corres∣pondynge to the seuen folde grace or gyftes of the holy goost / that is, the gyfte of wisdome and of vn∣derstandynge / of science, and goostly strengthe / of councell, and of pitie / and the gyfte of the feare of god. Fyrste (I say) by the ofte, continuall, and deuoute remembraunce of the passyon of our lorde, is gyuen to man the gyfte of the feare of god / and that agaynst the false surety of this present lyfe, & his most wicked pro¦myse / wherby many men bē withdrawen frō the loue of god / & let∣ted frō theyr true couersion vnto hym. For this fere constreyneth men to do well, and with all theyr herte to dyspyse all worldly pleasures. And therfore a deuout doctour sayeth, yt fere is ye auoi∣daunce
of euyll, & the prosecucion or wynnynge of goodnes. It is the begynnynge of godly wysdome, & thexpulsion of ignoraunce. By fere, all the perfection of actyue lyfe, & also of contemplatyue is preserued and kept / so that all bondage or seruile fere be exclu∣ded: For who so euer thrugh the feruent & deuout remēbraunce of this passion is crucified with Christe, to thauoidaunce of euyll, & gettyng of goodnes / to the stablisshment of his mynde, & mekyng of his hert: therunto he is prepared & induced by the gyft of ye fere of god / & that in this maner. A man seyng & consideryng that the son of god & our lord god in the nature of man suffred so great pai¦nes for our synnes / & how he punisshed our synne so greuously in hym selfe, moost innocent iudge, & moost pure & very god: More ouer, what paines, rebukes, & turmentes he is worthy, which dyd yt wickednes & most abhominable syn / for whiche, the moost inno¦cent & amorous or louely Iesu so greuously was turmēted. Thin¦kynge also herby, how muche this his syn dyd displease the hygh maiesty of god / & how muche god dyd abhorre it: so muche I say he abhorred it, yt he wold rather suffre his son / his own naturall & onely son to dye, than that syn shuld reigne in man / & it was more pleasure to hym to gyue his dere beloued son to the most shamfull dethe of the crosse: than yt he wold suffre any lōger tyme ye shame∣fastnes of our syn. Furthermore, a man seyng & consideryng how muche he offēdeth the high maiesty of god, by his continuaūce in actually synnyng & offendyng his high goodnes / contēpnynge or litle regardyng the passion of Christe / & therby his redemption: but dayly offendynge & doyng asmuche as lieth in hym to crucify Christe agayne, & put hym to those moost shamefull & cruell tur∣mentes. A man (I say) consideryng all these thynges, no maruell though in suche consideracion he trēble & quake before the presēce of god, whom he hath so greuously offended / & be ferefull, & shake as the aspen lefe yt is continually blowen & moued by the wynde / & so by fere, thinke hym selfe worthy of hym selfe, nothyng els but distruction or dāpnacion / & so he may in suche consideracions vt∣terly dispise hym selfe, & opteyne the feare of god. Wherfore good deuout brethern, let vs haue a recourse, & cōsider depely our own vanities and sinnes / and also the high maiestie & goodnes of god, whom we haue so greuously offended. And so let vs meke our self before hym asmuche as we may. For all that we can do, is to ly∣tle / considering his maiesty & our wickednes. Let vs therfore fere & be asshamed to lifte vp our iyes vnto heuē.Luce. 18. C. But knock vpon our brestes / & pray with ye Publican / yt he of infinite goodnes wold be
mercyfull to vs synners. It is a great mercy, yf it wolde please hym to beholde or loke vpon vs, whiche haue contempned & dis∣pised hym for a tryfle or a lytle vayne pleasure of the flesshe or of the worlde. Wherfore (as is sayd) let vs thrugh the consideracion & fere of his maiesty, repute our selfe as nought / & herafter thynk our selfe moost vile and vnworthy any goodnes / & so let vs arme our selfe agaynste our wyckednes and synne / and so be our owne proper Iuges. Let vs reuenge & punysshe in our selfe thiniury & offence that we haue done agaynste god / and subdue our selfe as muche as we may. And let euery one of vs say thus in him selfe, or to hym selfe: If my lorde god be thus dispised & tourmented for my sake & for my synne, how may I spare my selfe from punyssh∣ment and payne, that hathe synned? or how may I desyre or loke for any pleasure here? God forbyd that I shulde at any tyme pre¦sume to desyre any thynge of pleasure or dignity: but rather dis∣pise my selfe, & repute my selfe as moost vile, detestable, and ab∣hominable stynkynge carayn or dunge / whose stynche, I in my selfe can nat sustayn or bere / for I haue dispised my lord god. For my wretchydnes he suffred dethe. Now myn owne raymentes ab¦horre me / and all creatures dispise me / for I haue contempned the creatoure and maker of all thynges. What yf all creatures now myght haue voice and shulde speke / wolde nat they (thynke you) speke on this maner: This is he moost wicked and abhominable that haue contempned our lorde god / he hath loued vanitie more than god / he hath abused all vs, the creatures of god / wyllyng ra¦ther to serue the deuyll, than our lorde: He hathe derided & con∣tempned by his abhominable vyces, the power, wisdome, and goodnes of god: He hath feryd or drad more man, than god: He hathe more desyred the mucke of this world, than the moost high and pure goodnes: He wolde neither be drawen to goodnes by the swete giftes of god, ne yet feryd by his terrible & ferefull iud∣gementes / for he was nat affrayde to do his moost abhominable synnes in the presence & sight of god. Cum ye all the creatures of god, & let vs vtterly distroy this person that is holly & fully gyuē to do iniury vnto our lord. O thou erthe, why doest thou bere vp so wicked a person? Thou water, why doest yu nat drowne hym? Thou ayre, why doest yu nat withdraw thy selfe from him? Thou fyre, why doest thou nat burne hym? Thou wylde and rauenous beest, why doest thou nat deuoure hym? Thou stone, why doest thou nat stone hym to dethe? O thou hell, why doest thou nat swa¦low vp this moost vnkynde and wretched creature? And so furth
we might imagin of all the creatures of god / and meue them to re¦uenge the iniury of theyr creatour and maker. All this well con∣sidered, than we shall thynke or saye: Alas, wretche that I am / what shall I do? for I haue armed and prouoked agaynst me all thyng{is}. To whom shal I go? To whom shall I make my mone? I haue done contrary to all thynges / I haue contempned and of∣fended my lorde god / I haue prouoked his aungels / I haue disho¦noured his saintes / I haue in many wayes displeased my neygh∣bours: And shortly (to say the truthe) I haue offended all the cre∣atures of god, in that that I haue done iniury, and contempned god the creatour and maker of them all. To whome shal I go for socour, that hath made my selfe enemy to god and to all his crea∣tures? I know / I knowe what I shall do. I shall entre into the woundes of my lorde god / & I shall transfourme my / selfe / or take vpon me his paynes, sorowes, and rebukes / knowynge for a su∣rety that no creature shall be displeasant or heuy vnto me, yf they perceyue that I bere the pryntes of the woundes and sorowes of my lorde Iesu in my soule and body. And good brother, let vs re¦duce all these to .iii. poyntes / that is to thonour of god / to the pas∣sion of Christe, and to our owne direction and good order / & that bothe in soule and body. Nothynge wyllyng / non other desyryng but Iesu Christe / and that crucified / as saynt Paule sayd.1. Co. 2. A. Yet in all these thynges so order we our fere, that we euer trust in the in∣finite goodnes of god. For his infinite mercy farre excedeth all our malice and iniquity. This godly fere, is the occasion and be∣gynnynge of humilitie and reuerence / of a meruelous ascencion vnto god / and of contemplacion. For by this feare, man is specy∣ally led and brought vnto the superabundaunce of grace / wherby he may auoyd all euill / and get goodnes / and may liue modestly / with good maners / continently / temperatly / & chastly. These .iii. fruites of the holy goost / that is modestia / that is gentyll beha∣uour in wordes and dedes. Continence, that is to absteyne from thynges vnlawfull: And chastity / that is, rightely to vse thynges lawfull. These thre fruites (I say) accorde and perteyne to ye gyft of fere. Wherfore I may call this fere a Paradise of delites / from whence doeth procede abundaunce of all swetenes and pleasure. There man is inebriate with a pure swetenes / and with a merue¦lous gladnes he is (as it were) allienate from hym selfe. With an hygh feruent deuocion he slepeth and slumbereth in our lorde. And thus, to haue the spirite of the fere of god▪ is to be conuerted into god, to do well, and with all the desyre and affection of the
herte, to dispyse all vayn and transitory thynges. And therfore to this gyfte of feare, correspondeth the fyrst beatitude / that is, the pouerty of spirite.Libro. 1. de serm. di in monte. C. For as saint Austine sayeth: The feare of god perteineth to meke men. Of the which it is wryten: Beati paupe∣res spiritu:Mat. 5. A. Blessed be the pore in spirite: that is, meke persones. For sithe it apperteineth to the feare of god to giue due reuerence vnto god, and to be subdued vnto hym: that thyng that foloweth of this subiection, perteineth to the gyft of feare. And in that that a man subdueth hymselfe to god: he doeth nat labour to be mag∣nified for any thyng in hym selfe, or for that he doeth to any other persone / nor yet wyll be magnified therefore: but referreth all to god. For otherwise he shulde do contrary vnto the perfite subiec∣tion vnto god. And therfore the prophet Dauid saieth: Hii in cur∣ribus, & hii in equis,Psalm. 19. nos autem in nomine domini dei nostri inuoca∣bimus: These men do trust or reioice in theyr chariots / & other re¦ioice in theyr horses: But we reioice in ye name of our lorde god. And therfore it soloweth yt the gift offere is finally giuen to man for this intent / that the holy goost, therewith enterynge into the soule, shulde giue to vs the vertue of mekenes, whiche cureth our wounde of pryde / so that the meke person may therby ascende vn∣to glory of heuyn / whiche the proude aungell lost by his pryde. And this is it that we sayd before / that by the great mekenes and reuerence that our sauiour Iesu had towarde the high maiesty of god the father, in his moost blessyd passion: men, beholdynge & remembrynge the same, shulde be prouoked vnto lyke mekenes, reuerence, and honour towardes god, accordynge to theyr po∣wer, as theyr frailtie wolde suffre them / that thereby they myght be made apte to repare the order of the thronys. ¶Example of this gyfte of the feare of god. The seuenth Chapitre. ANd that this gyfte of feare is ofte tymes gyuen vnto suche persones as do feruently remembre the passion of Christe: we haue example of the blessed woman of whome we spake before,Capitu. 2. Maria de Ogines. It is wry∣ten in the foresayd boke of thistories of Vincent / that this blessed woman Marie had the chaste and louynge feare of god / and that without doubt,Li. 31. ca. 29 thrugh the ofte and feruent remem∣braunce of the passion of Christe / as we shewed before.Capitu. 2. And this godly feare was in her herte, as an ornamente of her brest, or a
stomacher / wherwith she represseth her hert frō all vaine though∣tes. It was in her mouthe as a brydell to restrayne her tongue. This feare of god was in his werke, as a pricke or brod to dryue her to labour, and kepe her from slouthe and sluggysshnes. And in all thynges it was to her as a squyre or rule to order her, that she shuld nat excede a due meane. This godly fere was in her, as a beome to make clene her herte from all doublenes / her mouthe from all falshed / and her werkes from all vanitie: By the which spirite of feare, at length she conceiued so great loue vnto pouer∣tie, yt scarcely she wolde kepe or reteyne to her vse those thynges that were very necessary for her. And for the loue that she had vn∣to pouerty, she was fully purposed in her mynde, to haue depar∣ted from her frendes, and gone into a straunge cuntrey / and there as a vile & abiecte person, to haue beggyd her lyuynge from dore to dore for godd{is} sake. And for the same purpose she had prepared a bag, wherein she wold put suche thynges as she shulde receiue of almose / & a lytle cup, wherwith to drynke water or els potage / yf she had any gyuen to her / & also she prepared for her werynge, olde clothes and patched garmentes / & so wolde haue performed these thyng{is} in dede, ne had ben the great instance of her frendes / the whiche with many teares and diligent desyres might scarce∣ly withholde her from that purpose. Nat withstandyng her good wyll dyd appere in the premisses / for she dyd that she might. Also she continued in this loue of pouerty / which appered in that that she cut hir table clothes or napkyns / and also her shetes / and gaue the one parte to the pore / reseruynge the residue for her selfe. And nat only by this feare of god she contempned all worldly riches: but also she dispised all worldly honour and glory / and all vayne praise of man / and that for the great swetenes and pleasure that she had in heuenly thynges. And nat onely she wold nat admyt or loke towardes these vanities: but also she refused them with ab∣hominacion of herte, & vtterly abhorred them. The loue of Christ was so feruent in her herte, that nothynge els was pleasaunt or sauory to her, but Christe. And moche more ye may se of her me∣kenes and pouerty in the sayd boke of Vincent historiall. ¶The gyfte of pitie is also gyuen to man by the feruent remembraunce of Christes passion. The .viii. Chapitre.
THe gyfte of pitie is gyuen to man by the continuall and feruent meditacion of the passion of Christe / wherwith a man ordereth & behaueth hym selfe iustly and deuout∣ly in the due honoure and worshyppynge of god / in due reuerence and intreatynge of holy scripture / and in the loue & due confortynge of his neighboure. In the whiche thre thynges con∣sisteth & standeth the gyfte of pitie:Prima Ti∣moth. 4. C. Whiche pitie (as saint Paule sayeth (is profitable to all thynges / & specially against the hard∣nes and malice of the herte. For that persone whiche is crucified with Christe thrugh the feruent remembraunce of his most bles∣sed passion: is kyndled with this gifte of pitie vnto the high com¦passion, benignitie, and mercy of his neighbour / and that on this maner. Whan a persone deuoutly and feruently beholdeth in his remembraunce the compassion and mercy that our sauiour Iesu Christe shewed vnto mankinde / and specially at his dethe & passi∣on (as we declared before in the gyfte of feare) anon he is moued and kyndeled / and his herte is opened towarde his neighboure,Ca. vi. hui{us} particule. bought & redemyd with the bloode of Christe, as we all be. I say this man thus considerynge, is so kyndeled vnto the loue of his neighboure / and that for the loue of his lorde god: that he is redy to gyue all that he hathe, and hym selfe also with glad mynde for the helthe and saluacion of his neighbour / for he considereth that his lorde god suffred dethe with moost greuouse paynes for his sayd neighbour. And moreouer, as he hath compassion vpon his sauiour Christe hangynge vpon the crosse, and that with all his hert: so he hath as great inwarde sorowe in his hert vppon his neighbour / whiche by his synfull lyuynge forsaketh the conforte that he myght haue by Christes woundes and passion / and so in his maner dispiseth the blood and dethe of Christe. I say he hath inwardly as great compassion of this person, as he wolde haue vpon hym selfe. Fyrst he is wounded and greued in his herte, for the contempt of his lord god. Secondly, for the hurt and damage of his neighbour whiche hath forsaken lyfe & glory euerlastynge, and hathe chosen voluntarily or wylfully eternall dethe & damp∣nacion. This good man seeth & considereth the contempt of god, the blood of Christe dispised / and the moost noble creature made to the ymage of god, wylfully to go to eternall paynes / and ther∣fore his herte melteth thrugh pitie, and is relented or resolued by compassion. And in like maner as he hath compassion of the hurt of his neighbour: so by the same gyfte of pitie, he hathe great re∣ioice and gladnes in his soule, of the goodnes and spirituall pro∣fite
of other persons / whan he {per}ceiueth that they order thē selfe to receiue the fruite & profite of the woūdes of Christe / with whom he entreth into the same woūdes / & is made one with thē. He ioy∣eth with them that be ioyfull of any goodnes. He is sory with thē that be sorowfull for theyr hurt & damage. He reputeth euery one of his neighbours, as hym selfe / seynge & consideryng yt bothe he & his neighbours be create & made of our lord god / marked & dig∣nified with his image / redemyd & bought with the same blood of Christe / & ordered to cum to one & the same glory. And most speci∣ally he openeth his hert vnto his neighbour, by this gift of pitie: for that he seeth & considereth his lorde god to be crucified for all people / & therfore he seeth & cōsidereth his lorde god in all people▪ He requireth & sercheth his sauiour crucified in all his neibours. He beholdeth him in thē all after his pore maner. He is all giuē to his neighbour: for he is hoolly & fully gyuē to his sauiour cruci∣fied. O what ioye is it vnto his hert, whā he seeth his neighbour do due honor vnto his sauiour crucified? He hath non enuy ther∣at / he is nat displeased therwith / he doth nat detract hym or speke euyll of hym / he wyll nat let hym nor hynder hym from yt honour / by signe, worde, or dede / nor giue hym any occasion to withdraw him from yt honour: but hoolly he desireth his neighbours {pro}fite / & abhorreth his hurte or peryll / reputyng & acceptynge bothe his neighbours hurt or profite, as his owne profite or hurt. And yt is specially for the loue yt he hath to our lord Iesu Christ / the which for the great loue that he had vnto the helthe of mannes soules / & to the honour of his father: he suffred most paynfull & shamefull deth of the crosse. Wherfore the zele & thonour of god / the compas∣sion of Christe / & the inflamacion or kyndelynge of his owne hert hereunto: be moost properly to be attended & beholden in ye woū∣des of Christ / for there they be had & gotē. And by this gifte of pi∣tie, ye hert of man is in a meruelous maner eleuate & lifte vp vnto his lorde god. For whan a man doeth enforce hym selfe asmuche as he may, to conforme hym selfe vnto the pitie and compassion that Christe god and man had and shewed vnto vs whan he suf∣fered the dethe of the crosse / than that soule pleaseth god singuler∣ly / in so muche that Christe wyll take that soule so comformable to his godly pitie, vnto his singuler loue and fauoure, vnto his swete enbracynges & halsynges / & kepe yt soule as his dere belo∣ued spouse / & induce and brynge that soule to perceiue his swete consolacions / suche a soule our sauioure loueth: asmuche as she loueth hym / that soule our lorde draweth to hym: for as muche
as that soule hath one felyng with Christ, in hauyng compassion of Christ, & of his neighbour with Christ. Also it hath one sauory knowledge with Christe: in duely honouryng god / one zele and feruent desyre to the saluacion of mannes soule with Christe / and so that soule is in a maner transfourmed into Christ, thrugh this gifte of pitie / whiche (as we sayd before) is profitable to all thyn∣ges. It couetyth thonour of god / it expelleth sorowes and trou∣bles from mannes soule / it feruently they steth and desyreth the fruite and profite of soules / it laboureth that the blood of Christe might take effecte in other persones / and it kyndeleth the soule in feruent loue to god and his neighbour. Wherefore dere beloued frendes, let vs approche hereunto, and labour diligently for this gyfte. For doubtles this one, amonge all other (and peraduen∣ture before all other gyftes) doeth moost please god. I pray you therfore let vs labour to do the wyll and pleasure of god / and let vs draw or sucke out of his woundes and syde this gifte of pitie. Let vs be all one in our lorde Iesu Christe crucified / and let vs requyre, se, or desyre non other thyng in our neighbour, but Ie∣sus Christe crucified. So louyng our neighbour, that with him we runne at all tymes into the woundes of Christe: Nat behol∣dynge or louynge hym as fayre, beautifull, stronge, or wyse / or any other suche lyke vaine and transitory thynges whiche may hinder or withdraw our soule from the loue of god: but onely be∣holdynge and louynge our neighbour, as redemyd and bought by the precyouse blood and dethe of our lorde, as anointed & was∣shed with his blood / and applied or put to the woundes of Christ by receiuyng the fruit of them. Let it nat be sene or thought hard and painefull to vs to suffre great paines / or (yf nede shulde re∣quyre) moost shamefull dethe for our neighbour: for whō Christ (the onely sonne of god) suffred moost greuous paynes, and the moost shamefull dethe of the crosse. Let vs all couet and desire for the profite and helthe of soules, all maner of rebukes and dispi∣synges / all afflictions, and tourmentes / and also to suffre moost vile or shamfull dethe. Let euery man be to vs, as our owne hert: for whom the hert of Christ was perced with a spere. Let vs mul∣tiply our preachynges and exhortacions, good examples, pray∣ers, fastynges, knelynges, watche, labours / & also suffre moc∣kes or scornes for the helthe of soules. Let this be our office and dayly excercise / our glory and ioye / and our consolacion, euer to offre sum thyng to almighty god for the profite of soules. Let nat the ryuer & fountaine of teares cease from our iyen: for our owne
synnes and also for the synnes of other. Let vs be content to be sa∣ciat and fulfylled with suche wepynges and sorowes in this vale of myserye and teares. Let our synnes and also the synnes of our ueighbours hynge euer in our syght / nat to iudge or condempne our neighbours, but to lament and wepe for them at all tymes / & nat onely let them be in our syght: but also let them entre & perce the ynner partes of our hertes. Let vs at all tymes and in all pla∣ces haue our sauyour Christe crucified in our presence. Let vs al∣wayes be feruent and deuout in all honour due to god, in the re∣uerence of holy scrypture, and in the loue and compassion of our neyghbours. In the whiche thre consysteth the gyfte of pitie. This ordre and ascencion in our soule doeth molifie all our hert, and sprede it abrood, and make it apte to receyue the spyryte of pi∣tie / whiche doeth quyet vs & set vs in great pleasure and fauour of Christe / where as we shall fynde spirituall foode, bothe within & outwarde / that is our moost tendre louer our lorde Iesu Christe, the rest or our soules, & the rewarde of our good dedes that we do thrugh this gyfte of pitie. And to this gyfte of pitie doeth corres∣ponde the seconde beatitude: Beati mites. Blessed the mylde. And hereunto saynt Austin sayeth:Li. 1. de  in mon∣te. C. Pitie accordeth and is conue¦nient vnto mylde persons. And as concernynge the fruites of the holy goost: these .ii. that is, goodnes and benignitie, ben directly attributed & appropriate vnto this gyfte of pitie / but the thyrde, yt is called Mansuetudo / that is, myldenes or gētilnes, perteineth to this gyfte of pitie indyrectly / for it taketh away the lettes & impe∣dimentes of the actes of pitie. And the spirite of pitie is gyuen to man, for that his hert shuld be moued & kyndled vnto beignitie / so that man vsyng duely this gyfte shuld cum to the same eternall possession & heritage yt he wold haue other men cum to. And this is it that we sayd before, yt by the great compassion, pitie, & mercy yt our sauiour Iesu Christ shewed vpon vs & vnto vs on ye crosse, we shuld be styred, moued, & kyndled to lyke werkes of pitie accor¦dyng to our power & habilitie vnto our neighbour / yt thereby we myght be made apt to the restauracion of thorder of archaūgels. ¶Example of this gifte of the spirite of pitie. Cha. ix. OF this gyfte of pitie we haue example in the forsayd bles∣sed woman Maria de Ogines, in the sayde boke of the histories of Vincent.Li. 31. ca. 3 Where as it is writen that nat only she auoyded all maner of euyll by the gyfte of the feare of god: but also by the spyryte of pytye (whiche she had withoute doubte) by the ofte and feruente remembraunce of the passyon
of Christe) she was made very feruente and prone or redye to all goodnes. She laboured and enforced hyr selfe as farre as hyr power wolde stretche, to fulfyll all the werkes of mercy, of a great and aboundaunte pytye that was in hyr. And aboue all other werkes of pitie, she had a feruent desyre to vysyte the sycke, and to assyste them in theyr infirmities, and also to be present at the deathe and sepulture or buryenge of the ded folkes, where she ve∣ry oft tymes receyued from god great spyrytuall conforte / and al∣so thrughe the reuelacion of god knewe many secrete and heuenly mysteryes. And this well appered in this history folowynge. Vppon a certayne day whan one of the systers of Ogines labou∣red in the extreme panges of dethe: this blessyd woman Maria beynge in hyr celle, se in spyryte a great multitude of deuylles a∣bout the bed of the sycke syster. And as the couent dyd say cōmen∣dacions for the soule of the sayd sycke syster, whō they thought to haue be ded: this holy Mary (in a maner forgettynge hyr mylde grauitie & sad shamfastnes) ran with hast vnto the bed of the sicke syster & stryuynge with those wicked spirites, nat only dyd resist thē with hyr feruent prayers: but also dyd chase & dryue thē away with hyr mantell or pall, as a man wolde chase away the flyes. And whan these wycked spyrytes dyd terrybly resyst hyr, and al∣ledgyd reasons for them yt this soule shuld perteyn to them: than she nat content with theyr importunitie, cryed and called vppon Christe, & vppon the blood of Christe that he shed for mannes sal∣uacion / & continually with a feruent mynde remembred the dethe of Christe that he suffred for vs. And yet these woode raungynge fendes, nat ceasyng of theyr importunity, but euer busy to deuour this soule by many craftye and deceytfull reasons: than this bles∣syd woman Maris, conceyuynge in hyr soule a great trust and confidence in god by the grace of the holy gooste.2. Corī. 3 A. (For as Paule sayth, where as is the spyryte of god) there is lyberty & great con¦fidence) she I say, hauyng great trust in god, sayd with a free spi∣rite & great boldenes: Good lorde, I wyll be pledge & surety for this soule. And thā furthwith the dāpned spirites fled & vtterly a∣uoyded / and the good aūgels cam and toke the soule. And so this blessyd woman gyuyng thankes to god, went to hyr owne cell / & prayed for ye sayd soule. And afterward as she was ī deuout pray∣er in ye day of ye feest of saint Peter & Paule for ye sayd soule: saint Peter appered to hyr, and shewed vnto hyr how the soule of the foresayd woman was in greuouse paynes of purgatorye, for as moche as she in hyr lyfe had moche inordinat loue to ye world & to
the pleasures therof, though at her dethe she had very contricion therof. And than this blessed woman, moued of pitie (as she was alwayes full of pitie, and specyally towardes the soules in pur∣gatory) dyd praye moche feruently and deuoutely for that soule. And nat content with hyr onely and owne prayers: requyred in∣stantly, and opteyned the prayers of many other deuout persons / and also caused many masses to be sayd for the sayde soule, vnto the tyme she was delyuered from payne, and taken vnto ioye and glory eternall. Many other examples of hyr pitie and com∣passion ye may rede in the sayde .xxxi. booke of the hystoryes of Vincent. ¶The gyfte of science or knowledge is optey∣ned by the feruent remembraunce of the passyon of Chryste. The .x. Chapitre. THe gyfte also of scyence and kuowledge of spyrytuall and godly thynges is gyuen to man by the continuall and deuoute remembraunce of the passion of Christe / thorughe the whiche gyfte, man may duely and iust∣ly lyue in this wretched worlde, where as flourysshe many fro∣warde and wycked persons. And yet that man that hath this gyft shall lyue godly, though he be amonges them / for he shall conty∣nue in his faythe, and defende it / and haue true compunction in his herte. He shall absteyne from euyll, and wysely admynystre or vse these temporall goodes. He shall dyrecte and ordre all his werkes to ryght reason / and applye his wyll to the wyll of god. Or we may saye that this gyfte of scyence doeth teache vs to be∣holde as in a moost pure glasse, all maner of contemplacion, and all maner of pacyence. And that is, yf we take this gyfte know∣ledge as a science or knowledge of these inferior thynges, in that that they be helpynge and inducynge to the contemplacion and knowledge of spyrytuall and heuenly thynges. As be the know∣ledge of our synnes that we haue done, of the benefytes that we haue receyued of god, and of the paynes that we haue deserued for our synnes. For the fyrste, that is for the knowledge of oure synnes,Hier. 2. D. it is sayde by the prophete: Arguet te malicia tua, & auersio tua increpabit te scito. &c. Thy malyce and synne shall reproue the / and thy tournynge frome god shall rebuke the / therefore know thou and dilygently consyder that it is bytter
and paynefull to the to haue forsaken thy lorde god / and to wante his feare in the. This maner of science is a very true knowledge and moche necessarye for vs / that is to knowe our selfe, and so to meke, dispise, or set lytle by our selfe. Of the seconde maner of knowledge / that is of the benefites of god: I say vnto you that amonges all the benefites that we receiuyd or dayly receyue, the greatest benefite of all other is the benefite of our redemption / in the which our lorde hath shewed vnto vs a sure argument or {pro}fe of his infinit and inestimable loue / that was, whan he suffred the moost shamefull and paynefull dethe for vs his enemies. This argumente or profe doeth engendre and greatly encrease in vs a knowledge moche pleasaunte and also necessarye for vs. Of the whiche knowledge saynt Paule sayeth: Non enim iudicaui me a∣liquid seire inter vos nisi Iesum Christum et hūc crucisixum.1. Cori. 2. A. I haue iudged & thoughte in my selfe that I haue non other knowledge amonges you, but the knowledge of Iesu Christe crucified. The thyrd maner of knowledge that is of the paynes due for our synnes, is also necessary for vs / & the profe or argument thereof / that is the knowledge of the paynes of hell or of purgatory: hath ben reueled and shewed to many holy sayntes. And those paynes of hell ben conteined in these two verses folowynge. Sitis & esuries, rigus, ignis, fetor, et horror. Tenebre, desperantes, victi, vermes{que} rodentes. That is: Thyrste & hunger, colde, fyre, stynche and vgsomnes or lothesomnes. Darkenes, desperacion, subiection, and gnastynge or gnawynge wormes. These thre ma¦ner of sciences with many other we may moost specially fynde & get in the meditacion of the passion of our lorde. And moost of all we shall get moche knowledge: yf ye diligētly serche the fygures of the olde law, correspondynge or signifienge this sayd passion of our lorde. For there is innumerable treasure hyd vnder those fygures, whiche may be founde with diligent serche. In ye which fygures be hyd a meruelouse swetenes of deuocion / all maner of scyence and sacietie or full contentacion of the soule for this lyfe. For he that is crucified with Christe by the continuall & feruent meditacion of his passion: shall se how these fygures & the scrip∣ture of god do shyne in the sayd passion / and so by the gyfte of sci∣ence he shall be eleuate and lyfted vp vnto a meruelouse swetenes of deuocion, and vnto an high perfection of contemplacion / and that on this maner. For fyrste to suche a person that feruently re∣membreth this passion, and depely sercheth these figures, shall appere how that the moost hygh goodnes of god the father hath
ordryd all thynges muche diligently vnto our profite. Secondly it shal appere how the onely sonne of god the father, our lord Ie∣sus Christe: muche godly and faithfully hath shewed vnto vs all thynges necessary vnto our helthe & saluacion. Nat onely by his wordes: but also by his examples. Thirdly, it shall appere how the passion of our sauiour Iesu was figured & signified from the begynnyng of the world / as it clerely appereth in holy scripture. What inwarde ioye & pleasure shall this be (thynke you) to that person that feareth these thinges & knoweth them? All these great and meruelouse thynges were done for vs. And to declare vnto you how all these thynges do figure and signifie our sauiour Ie∣sus crucified: let vs begyn at the begynnynge of the Bible / and so procede.Genes. 1. A. Fyrst, where it is sayd: In principio creauit deus celū et terram. In the begynnyng god hath creat heuen & erthe. That is to say: In his sonne Iesu crucified, god hathe restaured & re∣pared the nature of aungels / and the nature of man. It foloweth Dixit deus:Ibidem. Fiat lux, et facta est lux. God sayd, I wyll that lyght be made / and furthwith it was made. That is to saye / god wolde that his sonne Iesus shulde be as a light, set vpon the crosse / to ex∣pell & put awaye all darkenes of synne / and it was don. And this light also diuided the night from the day. That is, synne frō ver∣tue and grace. Also this light by his presence, causeth the day of grace and vertue. And by his absence, it is nyght of synne. Also Iesus Christe crucified,Ibidem. was as the firmament in the middest of the waters / diuidynge the waters of temporall and worldly con∣solacion, from the waters of eternall & spirituall consolacion. Or els diuidynge the waters of mannes wisdom, from the waters of godly wysdome. Or diuidynge the waters of vice, from the wa∣ters of grace. Or els diuidynge the waters of worldly tribulaci∣on, from the waters of heuenly consolacion. In Iesu also cruci∣fied, were gaderyd to gyder all the waters that were vnder the heuen / that is, he bare all our iniquities / and suffred payn for all our synne: Therefore in hym were gadered to gyder all the wa∣ters / so that in hym was a great flode of tribulacions / that is, of afflictions, dispisinges, and many other paynes. And so by his grace & goodnes: was our etrhe made drye. For before his bles∣syd passiō: we were worthely deputed to all paines & eternall tri∣bulacions / but now we be deliuered from those eternall paines by the merytes of his moost holy passion. Also he was that great, depe, large, & broode see, of the whiche speaketh the Prophete Da¦uid / and that well appered in his passion.
Note well here, how clerely and manifestly these figures done signifie our lordes passion. In lyke maner we may serche thrugh the hole scripture / and take what so euer figure we wyll / thoughe it appere very farre and diuerse from this passion. And yet nat withstandynge we shal perceiue a meruelouse correspondence or a concorde vnto this passion / whiche shall cause a swete melodie in our soules / whereby our hertes shal be meruelously conforted / and it shal make vs to entre into the contemplacion of god & god∣ly scriptures / yf we diligently serche these figures.Gene. 18. A Let vs consi∣der the figure, whan Abraham prepared a fat calfe and moost ten∣der / and gaue it vnto the thre aungels that cam to hym / that they shulde eate and fede thereof. This figure in the vtter apparence of the letter, semeth very baren and of litle fruite / but yet inward∣ly, it conteineth great swetenes of contemplacion. In lyke ma∣ner this sayenge:Gene. 2. B. Est lignum vite in medio paradisi. There is the tree of lyfe in the middle of paradise / that is, Christe hangynge vpon the crosse in the middle of the chyrche / or Christe in the vyr∣gyn wombe / whiche vyrgyn is as a paradise of pleasure. Also this figure:Ibidem. Eluuius egrediebatur de loco voluptatis. A flode or ry¦uer ranne out of the place of pleasure / that is, the flode or ryuer of mercy and grace from the syde of Christe. And so the foresayd fy∣gure that Abraham dyd gyue that mooste tender calfe to the thre men to eate: doeth signifie that god the father of heuyn, dyd giue his onely begotten sonne, moost tender and moost innocent, and full of all vertues and grace, to the dethe of the crosse for our syn∣nes. And that thre men dyd fede therof, doeth signifie that the ho∣ly trinitie, the father, the sonne, and the holy goost were fed and satisfied for our transgression by the passion of Christe: whiche before that passion were hungry and redy to take vengeaunce / & to punysshe vs for our synnes. And here now we may se the great swetenes and pleasaunt confort of this figure. Here by Abraham is vnderstanded god the father / and by the moost tender calfe, is signified the sonne of god / and by these thre men, is signified the holy trinitie / and yet the father and the sonne be nat dyuers god∣des: but one god. For though they be distincte persons, and eche of them is god: yet the thre persones ben but one god in trinitie of persones. And so I say, in this figure appereth the meruelouse and inestimable swetenes that is gyuen vnto the soule that dili∣gently sercheth this figure. For where as god in hym selfe was hungry and desirouse to do iustice vpon vs for our synnes: he of his infinite benignitie and goodnes, dyd and shewed that iustice
into hym selfe, or vpon hym selfe / for els surely that iudgement of iustice had deuoured & distroyed vs / yf it had fallen vpon vs / for there was no pure man that might saciate and satisfie that hūgry appetite of god: but onely the sonne of god and man / that moost tender calfe, whom god the father dyd make redy to meate. That is, he put hym to suffre all affliction, dispisinges, mockes, bea∣tynges, and moost cruell dethe: to satisfie his hungry appetite / for the great iniury and inobedience that we dyd vnto god. What is that? Bicause we offended hym: shuld he so iudge & condēpne him self / & so suffre paine for our synne? He was offended by vs / & that nat withstandyng, he was iudged by vs, in vs, and for vs. And so Christe, beynge one person in two natures / that is, bothe god and man. He was offended in his godly nature, as god / and iudged or condempned for our synnes in his manhode: So that the godhede was offended / and he in his manhode suffered. And bycause in one persone he was bothe god and man: therefore we may truely say that we dyd offende hym / and yet he suffred for vs / and so he was bothe offended, and also iudged and condempned. And that is more to be marueiled / after the dethe of this calfe / the sonne of god, where as we were worthy to want all his confort & goodnes / for asmuche as we had condempned hym and put hym to most shamefull dethe: this moost benigne and mercifull lorde, forgettynge in a maner the tyme past, & also all our malyce, dyd conforte vs and dayly doeth with his manifolde graces. We dyd euyll to hym, and he doeth good to vs. We slew hym, and he gy∣ueth spirituall lyfe to vs. We put hym to the dethe, and gyueth to vs hym selfe to our spirituall foode. Herein we may se the great merueiles of god hyd and couered in the holy scripture. Here in this calfe of Abraham we may receiue meruelous refection of spi¦rituall science, if we serche diligently the same. And so in like ma∣ner of many other figures in holy scripture. wherein the soule & mynde of man ought to be eleuate and lyfted vp by this gyfte of science / and knowledge of suche figures, correspondynge or sig∣nifienge the moost blessyd passion of our sauioure Iesu Christe / that by the feruent remembrance of the sayd passion he myght en∣tre into these most depe treasures of the goodnes of god / vnto the tyme that soule or mynde be depely entred into Christe crucified / and in a maner absorpte & drowned thrugh or in the feruent loue of Christe crucified. And than that soule shall receiue the gyfte of science / & know how to order his werkes accordyngly vnto right reason / and applie hym selfe vnto the conformitie of Christe. And
this is it that we sayd in the begynnynge of this chapiter / that the gyfte of science moueth a man to lyue iustly & truely in this wret∣ched worlde / where as flourysshe many froward and wicked per∣sones / and amonges them to defende his faithe / and to haue true compunction in his hert. The spirite of science or knowledge is for that intent gyuen vnto man, that that spirite, enterynge into the herte or soule of man: shulde instruct hym in thynges necessa∣ry for his saluacion / and shulde moue hym to true compunction & sorow for his offences / that man shulde know, that what so euer payne or tribulacion he hath: it is for his synnes / and if he be pa∣cient: for his great profite. And what so euer goodnes he hathe: it is of the mercy and grace of god. And so thereby he shulde lerne to be euer subiect to god / and to praise hym in all werkes / & neuer to murmure against hym: but in all thynges and at all tymes to shew mekenes and pacience / and euer confesse god to be iust and true in all his werkes / and so folow thexample of Christe, which is the myrroure of pacience / and also the rewarde eternall of the true and meke paciet. Moreouer, by the true compunction of herte (whiche springeth of mekenes thrugh thoperacion and help of this godly science) is swaged the wrathe & indignacion of the mynde. And contrary wayes / wrathe doeth ouercum and spiritu∣ally slee the vnwise person that wanteth this gyfte of scyence. As whan in aduersitie he is moued or styred / and also blynded by the vice of impacience / in so muche that he doeth nat know that suche paines and tribulacions as he suffereth: cummeth to hym by his owne demerites and synnes. Or els whan he is lyfted vp in pro∣speritie / he is so blinded by pryde / that he will nat know how that all the goodnes that he hath, cummeth of god. And lyke as we se in daily experience, that after rayne cummeth fayre wedder: so after the vertue of true compunction and sorowe for our synnes, foloweth the rewarde of consolacion. For who so euer wyll free∣ly punyssh hym selfe in this lyfe for the loue of god: he shall fynde hereafter a true ioye and gladnes without ende. And therfore our sauiour sayth:Math. 5. A Beai qui lugent, quoniam consolabuntur. Blessed be they that wepe and mourne in this lyfe for the loue of god: for they shall be conforted. And this is the thyrde beatitude / whiche correspondeth to the gyfte of science.Li. 1. de ser.  in mon∣te. C. For as saynt Austin sayeth / science is accordynge to mourners. Right iudgement of creatu∣res / or to iudge truely of creatures: perteineth vnto the gyfte of science. For oftymes men, thrugh thoccasion of creatures, turne them selfe from god, and so commyt greuouse synne / as the wyse
man sayeth:Sapi. 14. B Creature facte sunt in odium, & muscipulam pedibus insipientium. Creatures made of mā to the seruice of god / thrugh the synne of man, ben made to the hatred of man / and as a trap or a snare to the fete of vnwise men / for asmuche as suche men, wan∣tynge right iudgemente and knowledge of the creatures, do put theyr full confidence and trust in them / whiche they shulde haue & put in god / and so consequently they do synne and lese the true & infinite goodnes. And this great damage of man, is made kno∣wen to man by the right iudgement of creatures / whiche he hath by this gyfte of science. And therefore couenitly is the beati∣tude of mournynge assigned to reaunswere vnto the gyfte of sci∣ence. Whiche graunt vnto vs that moost tender calfe that hynge vpon the crosse for vs. Amen. ¶An example of this gyfte of the spirite of science. Chapitre .xi. OF this gifte of discrecion and of science, we may haue example in the foresayde blessed woman Maria de Ogines.Li. 31. ca. 3 Of whō it is wryten in ye histories of Vin∣cent / as foloweth. For asmuche as to this blessed wo¦man (in auoidyng all euill by the spirite of the feare of god / & in doynge good by the spirite of pitie) was also necessa∣ry a warenes & a circumspection of discretion / therefore almigh∣ty god,1. Ioh. 2.  the father of light and knowledge / whose vnction and spi∣rite teacheth vs in all thynges necessary, dyd illuminate & lygh∣ten his doughter Marie with the spirite of godly science. (And that without doubt was thrugh her continuall and feruent remē∣braunce of Christes passion). God I sayde gaue to her the gyfte of knowlege / that thereby she might know what was to be done / and whā / and what was to be auoided / and that all her sacrfices and paines taken for god, she might order with discrecion. For oftymes vice wyll shew hym selfe to be vertue / and euyll oftymes is taken vnder the colour of goodnes. And whan we wold auoide one vice: oftimes we fall into the contrary vice / and therfore this spirite of godly knowledge is necessary for vs. Sumtyme this blessed woman whan she was made one spirite with god, & was ioyned vnto hym with the glew of feruent loue to hyr great plea∣sure and swetenes. If she herde of the cummynge of straungers to speke with her: she wold (I say sumtyme) with great violence withdrawe her selfe from that great pleasure of contemplacion /
from the swete halsynges of her spouse Christ, lesse that she shuld slaundre those straungers. I say she wolde withdraw her mynde from that contemplacion with so great vehemence of sorow, that sumtyme she voyded or spytted pure blood / & that in great quan∣titie, to her great payne and affliction. Wyllyng rather so to pu∣nisshe her selfe with that great martyrdom, than to trouble or vn∣quyet the peace and quyetnes of her systeren and bretheren / and specyally of pylgrymes or straūgers. Yet sūtyme whan she knew (thrughe the reuelacion of the holy goost) the cummynge of sum straungers: a good tyme before they cam, she wolde go pryuely into the feldes or woodes nygh vnto her cell, and there wolde she hyde her selfe, that vnneth or scarcely hyr owne company myght fynde her, all thoughe they searched for hyr all the daye. And sumtyme contrarye wayes, whan she was in slepe, yf there cam to hyr pore and symple persons for theyr necessitie or conforte, she was sodaynly awaked and compellyd to ryse, onely by thopera∣cion and mouynge of the holy goost, whiche than sayd vnto hyr: Spede the, there is one that abydeth for the to speke with the / nat for any curiositie: but for very necessitie. Moreouer though this blessyd woman with a meruelouse discrecion kept alwayes peace with hyr neighbours, and nat onely with them that were good & vertuouse: but also with them that appered nat so vertuouse: yet towardes hyr selfe she was meruelously vndiscrete / moche abiec∣tynge and dispisynge hyr selfe / and (as it semed to hyr company) punysshynge hyr selfe sumtyme aboue measure. But certeynly, so moche the more she was dyscrete to hyr selfe: for as moche as she dyd nat presume to do any thynge vnto hyr selfe, but as she was famylyarely taughtof the holy goost. For she durst nat ab∣steyne one hole day from her refection: except that she were most surely rauysshed & rapte vp aboue hyr selfe, and from all hyr sen∣sys. And yet sumtyme whan she was rapte, she dyd attempte and proue to take hyr refection, to auoide thoccasion and murmure of other persons that were in hyr company, but in no meanes she myght receyue it into hyr stomack / and for payne therof, she was sumtyme almoost ouercum. And therfore afterwarde she had that lyberty to absteyne whan she wold, and non occasion taken ther∣of / nor any man durst aske of her,Ibid. ca. 37 why she dyd so. Also oftentymes whan the preest lyfted vp the blessyd sacrament of the body of our lorde aboue his hed: she se bytwyxte the handes of the preest, the forme and shap of a moost fayre chylde. Also she se a great multi∣tude of aungels / descendyng from heuyn with a great lyght. And
after the vsynge or receyuynge of the sacrament, she se in spirite our lorde remaynynge in the soule of the preste, and lyghtenynge it with a meruelouse clerenes. Or els, yf the preest receyuyd the body of our lorde vnworthely, she se than our lord departed from that soule with indignacion, leuynge it in a great darkenes, and voyde of all goodnes. ¶The gyfte of strengthe is gyuen to man by the feruent remembraunce of Christes passion. The .xii. Chapitre. BY the deuoute and ofte remembraunce of the passion of our lorde, is also gyuen vnto man the gyft of gost∣ly strength agaynste our spyrytuall enemies and the multitude of temptacions. And by this gyfte, inordi∣nate feare is put away. Hardy and inordynate bold∣nes is reduced to a due measure / and all aduersities ben strongly borne & suffred. For who so euer be crucified with Christe thrugh the feruent remembraunce of his blessyd passion▪ is animated and strengthed to entrepryse great and harde thynges / to contempne and set at nought all worldly pleasures / to suffre paciently and gladly all tribulacions, and to expugne or ouercum all vyces. That faythefull seruaunt whiche doethferuently remembre his lordes passion, and to whom his lorde hathe gyuen many gra∣ces, that person I say doeth consydre and se the meruelouse and incomprehensible strengthe of Christe in his interprysyng great battels, in his sufferaunce, and in the vanquesshynge or subdu∣ynge of the deuyll. I say in his entreprysynge of great and harde thynges / for he faught great and terryble battelles for the salua∣cion of his enemy, vnkynde man. Also the meruelouse strengthe of Christe doeth appere in his pacience, where as he suffred most obprobriouse, sharpe, and greuouse tourmentes / and that of his creatures. And thyrdely his incomprehensible strengthe was she∣wed in subduynge so myghty and strong a lorde (or rather I may saye a tyraunte / the deuyll that vsurped the dominion ouer all the worlde / whome our lorde by the dethe of the crosse strongely dyd ouercum / and so by his dethe destrued the autor and cause of deth. These thynges well considered, it is no maruell yf the faythefull knyght of Christe, and folower of his lorde, moued by these exam¦ples of Christe, entrepryse and go aboute to do great and harde thynges. And the more harde, vyle or paynefull the thynges be,
the more gladly, diligently, and more feruently wyll he attempte them. And that specyally yf it be to the laude and honour of god, and the helthe & conforte of soules. For than there can be nothyng to harde, to vyle, nor to paynfull for hym to do or suffre for god / whiche dyd so great thynges for hym so vyle a wretche. Yea also he thynketh all thynges (though they be neuer so paynefull) to be swete, pleasaunt, delectable, commendable, and moche to be desy∣red: yf thereby he may be assimulate or made lyke vnto the moost shamefull and paynefull dethe of Christe his lorde god. Those thynges this faythfull seruant doeth more gladly, in those he oc∣cupieth hym selfe more aiudiously, those thynges he sercheth and oft remembreth / those he desyreth to fulfyll with a feruent mynde / nat grudgynge nor sayenge, why put you me to this vyle offyce, to this shame, to this labour and payne? But rather thynkynge, why shal I nat do these thynges with a glad mynde? Nor he do∣eth nat repute or thynke hym selfe to be of any reputacion for that he serueth god: but he thynketh it a greate thynge, that it wolde please almighty god of his onely goodnes to accept vnto his ser∣uyce so vyle, vnworthy, and moost myserable wretche as he is. Wherefore in all these thynges, his herte is onely pleased in that, that he may be conformable to his lorde god, and that he doeth fo∣low hym in sufferaunce of troubles, as moche as he may for hys frailtie. And that he suffreth: he knowledgeth it to be for his syn∣nes. And all his ioye is, that his lorde is honoured by his glad pa¦cience and sufferaunce of tribulacions. This faythfull seruaunte hathe so strongly subdued and tyed his appetyte vnder the yocke and captiuitie of ryght reason: that it shall nat haue his wanton pleasure in any carnall or worldly desyre / nor yet in any vayne or vnprofytable thynge. Also he kepeth his herte with all diligence as a castell of greate strengthe / so that he wyll nat suffre any syn∣full thought to rest therein / nor yet any vayne or vnfruitfull ima∣ginacions to wandre therein. He is euer thynkynge or conside∣rynge those thynges that ben spyrytuall and godly, or inducyng vnto god / & with great ioye he desyreth those thinges / & feruently laboureth to bryng them to effect. But for as moche as in this lyfe euermore or for the moost parte the chaffe is myxt with the corne: therfore this faythfull seruant taketh the rydell or wyndose of dis∣crecion in his hande, and so wyndeth and purgeth the chaffe from the corne: in the doore of his herte. He taketh into his hande the burnynge and sharpe swerde to kepe diligently his herte, as the paradyse of god / so that what so euer in his herte desyreth to eate
of the tree of lyfe (that is, all suche thoughtes as be godlye, spirituall, and lyuely) suche he diligentely doeth cheryssh and nourysshe. And yf any thoughte do onely loke vnto the fruyte forboden / that is to any thynge contrary to the commaundemen∣tes or pleasure of god: suche thoughtes he wyll shortely expell frome his herte / so that they shall haue no pleasaunt abydynge there. The dysceytfull serpent shall haue none entraunce into that herte. Ne yet the flatterynge persuacion of the woman. And yf peraduenture he perceyue any suche appere in his herte: anon he wyll remoue it wyth indignacion and sharpe rebukes / for there onely bene nourysshed manly / godlye / and vertuouse thoughtes. And therefore suche a persone that is thus puryfyed in soule and bodye: may trewly order hym selfe to the contem∣placyon of god. For he neuer lyfteth vppe his syght or iyes vn∣to vayne thynges. Ne hys eares to heare noysome or vnprofy∣table thynges. Nor hys nose to smell swete odours nor smelles. Nor hys mouthe, to taste delycate thynges. Ne yet hys tou∣chynge, to feele softe thynges / and that inordynately: But with all dylygence he kepeth hym selfe bothe inwardely and outward∣ly / so that nowe he shoulde nat be called a seruaunte or bounde: but rather a lorde and free. For he hathe domynyon ouer hym selfe by subdewynge of all inordynate and sensuall appetytes / as muche as a man may haue lordeshyppe ouer hym selfe in thys lyfe. And so (I say) suche a persone for his puritie, is mooste apte to receyue the godlye influencys and spyrytuall illustraci∣ons. For the sonne of Iustyce doeth inhabyte suche a pure and clene soule, shynynge in euery corner thereof / and lyghtenynge the inwarde partes of the same. That is, the thre powers of the soule / so that he may do all thynges necessarye for his saluacion by the power of the father almyghty. He knoweth all thynges, by the wysdome of the sonne our sauyoure Christe Iesus / and wyll all goodthynges, by the goodnes of the hooly gooste. These be the thre mansyons or tabernacles that god maketh in the soule of the iuste and pure persone / for there he fyndeth no∣thynge that shulde let or resyste contrarye to hym. And so our lorde doeth shyne so longe in that soule: vnto suche tyme that soule thorughe that bryghte lyghte and clearenes be ab∣sorpte / and (in a maner) as it were drowned or swalowed vppe into god. And than the soule so rauysshed and lyfted vp aboue it selfe:Psalm. 38. doeth entre in to the godlye clowde / after thys maner cryenge and sayenge thus. Et nox illumininatio mea in deli∣tiis
meis. This nyghte or clowde is my lyghte, to my great con∣forte and pleasure. And thus ye may se that the soule by the gyfte or spyryte of strengthe is lyfted vp aboue all feare of perylles of our enemies / it feareth nothynge but synne that displeaseth god / it is nat subdued to any passion / and is redy to excercyse all wer∣kes of strengthe. It is nat ouercum by any (conflyete or battell in temptacion. And all this is opteyned and gotten by the con∣tinuall and feruent remembraunce of Christes passion. And here vnto saynt Paule sayeth:Ephe. 6. B. Confortamini in domino, et in potentia virtutis eius. Ye be conforted in our lorde, and in the power of his vertue / that is in his passion where as his great power and ver∣tue was shewed,Psalm. 67. Also the prophet Dauid sayeth: Ipse dabit virtu∣tem et fortitudinē plebi sue. He shal giue vertue, power, & strength to his people. And by his power we haue the vyctorye oure ouer enemies / as saynt Paule sayeth:1. corī. 15. G Deo gratias qui fecit nos vincere per dominum nostrum Iesum Christum. Thankes and praysynges be to god that hath gyuen to vs the vyctory ouer all our enemies, by the merytes of our lorde Iesus Christe. And in an other place saint Paule sayeth thus:Ephe. 6. B. Indute vos armatura dei, vt possitis stare aduersus inidias diaboli. Put vpon you the armoure of god, that ye may stande strongly agaynst the disceites and pryuy assautes of the deuyll. These be the armours of god: and also vnder hym our armoure. Let vs take his crowne of thorne, for our salet or helmet. For our swerde, the nayles of his handes. For our spur∣res, the nayles that persed his fete. For our Iacke or haubergyn, the betynges of his body with scourges. For our sheld, the crosse as our lorde bare it to the mounte of Caluary. For our horse, the same crosse / as Christe dyd hynge and dye thereon. With this ar∣moure we shall ouercum the deuyll / for thereunto we shall haue strength thrugh the feruent meditacion of the passion of Christe. To this gyfte of goostly strength, correspondeth the fourthe bea∣titude / that is:Math. 5. A. Li. 1. de ser. di in mon∣te. C. Beati qui esuriunt et sitiunt iustitiam. Blessed be they that hunger and thyrste iustice. For as saynt Austyn sayeth: Strengthe is conuenient to them that hunger and thyrst iustice. for they labour diligently desyrynge to haue ioye and pleasure in and of thynges that be very good / and also labourynge to tourne theyr loue from all worldly and vayne thynges. And this conue∣niency doeth also appere in that, that this gyfte of strengthe con∣systeth and standeth in harde thinges & of great difficulty (as we sayde before). It is a greate and an harde thynge that a man shuld nat only do vertuouse werkes which comonly bē called the
werkes of iustice: but also that he shulde do them with a feruent, and (in a maner) an insaciable desyre of iustyce / whiche is signi∣fied by this hungre and thyrst of iustice. To this gyfte also of goostly strength, correspondeth and accor∣deth amonges the fruites of the spyryte, these two fruites. Paci∣ence, whiche concerneth the sufferaunce of euyll or payne. And longanimitie, whiche consysteth in the taryenge or continuall a∣bydynge for the good promyses of god / that is eternall glory, the rewarde of vertuouse werkes. And so this spyryte of strength is gyuen to man, that it shulde aryse and lyfte vp the tedyouse & we∣ry soule whiche was almoost deiect & cast downe by the dayly suf∣feraunce of euyll and paynes / and for beholdynge or abydynge of the good promyses of god. And this gyfte so doeth lyfte vp this soule, that it (opteynynge his formar vertue and strength) doeth put away all suche dulnes & werynes, and also waxeth stronge to the desyre of inwarde swetenes / and so consequently to the desyre of eternall pleasure. Also this spyryte of strength doeth cause in mannes soule the hunger & desyre of iustice / so that the soule here in this lyfe feruently desyryng the werkes of iustice, may herafter be full saciate with consolacion eternall for his rewarde. And to this we sayd before,Capitul. 2. huius part. that by thexample of the mekenes & pacience of Christe in his passion, for the whiche he was exalted and had a name aboue aboue all names / as saynt Paule sayeth:Phill. 2. B. Men shuld be prouoked and moued to the folowynge of Christe in corporall paynes and afflictions. In subduynge all vyce & inordinate con∣cupiscencys or desyres. In hungerynge & thrystynge the werkes of iustice / and in hauynge dominion ouer all his appetytes / and rewlyng them by ryght reason / that they so doynge, may be made apte to the reparacion of thorder of the dominacions / aungels or heuenly spyrytes so called. ¶Example of this spyryte of strengthe. The .xiii. Chapytre. VIncent in his hystories sheweth an example of this gyfte of strengthe,Li. 31. ca. 3 of the blessed woman Maria de Ogines / thus sayenge: For as moche as it but lytle auayleth to a∣uoyde euyll by the spyryte of feare / and to do good by the spirite of pitie / & thyrdely, by the spyryte of knowledge to haue discreciō in all thynges / except also by ye spirite of strength we resyst all euyll / & kepe our goodnes by pacience / and also by fyrme constancye &
stablenes perseuer and so continue vnto the dethe / & so at lengthe (by our long abydyng) receiue therernall rewarde promised vn∣to vs / this (I say) our lord & father omnipotent consideryng, dyd open his infinit treasures, & dyd adourne & beautifie his dere be∣loued doughter Marie (no dout for hyr feruēt & continuall remē∣braūce of Christes passion) with the fourth precyouse stone / yt is, with the gyfte of goostly strengthe / & so dyd arme hyr agaynst all aduersities or dartes of the enemy / that neither she was deiecte & cast downe by any trouble or aduersitie: nor yet lyfte vp in pryde by any false & flatterynge prosperitie. One tyme whan she was greuously vexed with the paralisie or palsey / in so moche that for great payn she was constreyned to crye & knocke vpon hyr brest: there was one of hyr familiar frendes, a deuout person in a secret place nyghe / the whiche herynge and perceyuynge hyr greuouse paynes: with great compassion and deuocion prayed for hyr / and she by the spiryte of god, perceyuyng that by his prayers hyr pay∣nes were minisshed, sayd vnto hyr seruynge mayd: Go & say vn∣to that man, that he cease of his prayers for me / for though by his prayers myne infirmitie is releuyd: yet thereby I lese the merit that I might haue by pacient sufferaūce. An other tyme whan she was vexed with greuouse paynes or troubles, there was one of hyr deuout louers whiche secretly in his hert was very sory and heuy for hyr vexacion and grefe / the whiche she knowynge by the reuelacion of god: sent hyr mayde vnto hym, sayenge: Byd hym sorow no more for me. For she was more greued or heuy for the sorowes of other persones, than of hyr owne infirmities or trou∣bles. And nat onely by the spyryte of strengthe she had power to resyste all aduersaryes: but also to absteyne for all carnall and wanton desyres. This blyssed yonge woman had so subdued & dried hyr body betwyxt the two trees of the crosse / that is betwyxt the remembraunce of the passion of Christe / and beryng hyr own crosse by continuall penaunce: that by many yeres byfore hyr dethe, she neuer felte the mocions of vnclennes fyrst styrynges in hyr body. And thereby she had a greate confydence or boldenes to be in the cumpany of men / for she of hyr abundaunt innocency & pure simplicitte, supposed and thought that all other persones had ben as she was. And therefore one tyme whan one of hyr famylyare frendes of a feruente spyrytuall affection that he had to hyr, dyd holde hyr faste or wrynge hyr by the hande / thoughe for his chaste mynde he thoughte no synne: yet as a frayle man thorughe suche touchynge, he felte a lytell pleasure sensuall.
But she nothynge felynge in hyr selfe, nor knowynge of his mo∣cions: herde a voyce from heuen, sayenge in latyn thus: Noli me tangere. Touche me nat. Yet she knew nat what what those wor∣des ment or signified. For our lorde god very mercyfull and be∣nygne, hauynge compassion of our frailtie, wolde nat rebuke or confounde that man in the presence of that holy woman. Yet he wold as a true and faythfull louer, kepe the chastitie of his frēde. Than the blessed woman sayd to that man: I herde a voice, say∣enge Noli me tangere. But what it meaneth, I knowe nat. And than that man consyderynge the goodnes of god towardes hym, made an honest excuse, seyng that our lorde wolde nat confounde hym openly / and so departed, gyuynge thankes to god, and kepte hym selfe more warely afterwarde. ¶The gyfte of councell is gyuen to man by the remembraunce of Christes passion. The .xiiii. Chapitre. BY the feruente and contynuall remembraunce of the passyon of Christe, is gyuen to man the spyryte and gyfte of godly councell agaynst our inaduertence and neclygence. Whereby in this myserable and daunge∣rouse worlde we may beware of all perylles and daū∣gers / we may entrepryse and take on hande harde thynges / and also do thynges of moost dyffyculty. For that persone whiche is crucyfyed with Christe thorughe the feruent meditacion of hys gloryouse passion, is styred and rauysshed to do the werkes of su¦pererogacion. Whereunto he is nat bounde by the preceptys and commaundementes of god / and thereunto he is lyfted vp, and lo∣uyngely drawen by the spyryte of councell / on this maner folo∣wynge. Fyrste he remembreth how oure lorde Iesus Christe was obedient to his father, and so continued vnto the dethe of the crosse / subdued vnto all vilitie, subiection, derision, and many∣folde sorowes and paynes for vs. And in all these, onely requy∣rynge and serchynge his heuenly father honour and glorye / and so at last, subdued to the most shamefull dethe for our redemptiō. Secōdly he remēbreth how Christ, though he were always pore, yet he was most pore whan he, poiled & robbed of all his clothes, was put naked vppon the crosse for our synnes. And thyrdely
he remembreth how he that was moost swete, pleasaunt, and so∣lace of aungels: was replenisshed & fylled with all bytternes, so∣row, and payne whan he honge vpon the crosse. This very true vyn our sauiour Iesus Christ, was oft tymes cut. Fyrst in his incarnacion, whan as he was in our nature made of lesse perfec∣tion than aungels / though by his godly nature: he was the crea∣tour, maker, and glory of aungels / and so was in a maner his glo¦ry cut from hym with the knyfe or cultre of ignominie / for to the fyghte of the worlde he was nat gloryouse: but rather he appered vyle and ignominiouse. His power was cut with the cultre of de¦rection. His pleasure, with the knyfe of sorow. His rychesse, with he knife of pouerty. And at last there was cut from hym with the cultre of feare, all his frendes and acquaintaūce / so that of all his dere louers, there was nat one man to conforte hym in his tribu∣lacions. And therefore the prophete sayd in his person: Torcular calcaui solus,Esay. 63. A & de gentibus non est vir mecum. I alone haue trodē or laboured in the presse of tribulacion: & there was nat one man that wolde conforte and helpe me. Also the prophete Dauyd say∣eth in the person of Christe:Psalm. 68. Improperium expectauit cor meum & miseriam, et sustinui qui simul contristaretur, et non erat, et qui consolaretur: et non inueni. My herte hathe susteyned and suffred rebuke and mysery. And I loked yf that any man wolde suffre or be heuy with me: and there was none. Also I loked yf that any man wolde conforte me: & I founde non. Moreouer he in whom was all treasures of wysdome and knowledge hyd / he that was kynge of all kynges / and so ryche that he had no nede of any other mannes goodes but of his pleantie gyueth to euery man: This wyse and ryche emperoure (I say) was made so pore, that there myght none be founde more pore. No, nat amonges the foxes of the erthe: ne yet amonges the byrdes of the ayre. And therfore he sayeth of hym selfe:Math. 8. C Vulpes foueas habent, et volucres celi nidos, filius autem hominis non habet vbi caput suum reclinet. The fox∣es haue theyr caues or dennes, & the byrdes of the ayre haue theyr nestys / but the son of a vyrgyn hath nat where to hyde or laye his hede. He was pore in his natiuitie or byrthe: Porer in his lyfe, or processe of his lyfe. And moost pore vpon the crosse at his deth. At his byrthe he was fedde with the vyrgyns mylke, and lapped in vyle or pore clothes. In the processe of his lyfe he had pore clo∣thynge. But oft tymes he wanted meat & drynke for his necessary sustenaunce. But at his dethe thou shalt fynde hym naked and in extreme thyrste or dryenes / excepte thou say that he had vynegre
myxte with bytter myrre and gall to quenche his thyrste. These thynges well consydered, the soule of the person beholdynge and depely remembrynge them: is shortely and easely persuaded and moued to folow our sauiour Iesu in lyke thynges / so that he may now gladly withdraw him selfe from all worldly honours and de¦syres of the same / from all possession of temporall goodes / & from all corporall consolacion and pleasure / desyrynge with his lorde god all vylenes, abiection, and derision / and to suffre payn in all his hole body / that thereby he myght in sum thynge be made con∣formable to his lord god, and so do to hym sum thankfull seruice. His appetite and desyre is nat now to please men: but rather for the loue and honour of his lorde god, to be mocked, scorned, despi∣sed, and to be rather hated of them, than honoured. And therefore all vayne prayse and laudes gyuen to hym, ben abhominacion & as stynkynge caryon vnto hym / for he onely requyreth and desy∣reth the laudes and prayses of god. Vnto that, is all his study, la∣bour, & payne. That, he desyreth with an vnsaciable thyrst. In all thynges he onely desyreth thonour of god. Nothynge lokynge to hym elfe, nor regardynge any thynge perteynynge to hym selfe, ne yet wyll be bounde to do any thyng / but all to gyder with hert and mynde lokynge vnto heuen, where as is moost his pleasure. And also he desyreth that by his rebukes his lorde god myght be honoured / greatly and continually desyrynge thrughe this gyfte of councell, bothe to be pore and also despysed and abiecte for the loue of god, for as muche as he perceiued bothe these to be in his lorde god crucified. And truely he wolde now and euer be naked with Christe vpon the crosse / beynge very heuy or sory yt he shuld haue any thynge that myght helpe the pore / or els that perteyneth to thonour of god. Therfore he, forsakynge all superfluitie, vseth as few thynges as his necessitie wyll suffre hym / so that his plea∣sure is moche more set to despyse and cast awaye rychesse, than to get or multyply it. And to speke of corporall delectacions, conso∣lacions and pleasures: we may truely say, that from al these, and also from all other consolacion that is nat in god, of god, or for god: he vtterly refuseth them as moche as it is possyble for hym / euer askynge and desyrynge to be saciate and fulfylled with byt∣ternes, sorow, and payne or affliction with his lorde and mayster Christe. Wherfore, what so euer he perceyued to be pleasaunt vn∣to his bodye, or yet vnto his herte, by the whiche he may nat be made conformable vnto the moost blessed woundes and passion of Christe: that thynge he abhorreth / withdrawynge hym selfe
from all thynges (thrugh this gyfte of councell) wherein he seeth any peryll or daunger lyke to cum to hym. And therfore he doeth all thynges with greate deliberacion. And also thrughe the sayde gyfte of coūcell, he applyeth hym selfe to do all tho thynges wher∣by thonour of god, ye charitie of his neighbour, & the helth of sou∣les may be in any thynge encreased. And for these causes he is ofte tymes solitarie, depely considerynge the passion of Christe, ther∣in lerchynge the hygh honours of god, theternall ryches, and he∣uenly pleasures / that the deuout soule therin restynge, may haue great ioye. Also thereby the bytter soule for the compassion of Christes passion, is made swete and pleasaunte. And the mynde eleuate and lyfted aboue it selfe: is made dronken or is drowned in loue. And o the soule full of pleasure and lenyng vpon hyr dere beloued: restyth hoolly in hyr lorde god. And this is it that we sayd before, how thrugh the spyryte of councell we auoide all pe∣rylles and daūgers / make our selfes sure in the holes of the stone / that is in the woundes of Christe to entrepryse great, herde, and paynefull thynges / and also to excercyse the werkes of superero∣gaciō / as is to loue our enemies, and to forgiue them for Christe / to gyue all our goodes to pore people for the loue of Christe / to the which werkes don by the spiryte of coūcell, correspondeth the fyfte beatitude / of the whiche Christe sayeth:Math. 5. A Beati misericordes quoniam ipsi misericordiam consequentur. Blessed be ye mercyfull / for they shall haue mercy.Li. 1. de ser.  in mon∣te. C. For as saynt Austyn sayeth: Councell is accordynge to mercyfull persones / for there is but one remedy or meane to be delyuered from all the perylles of this worlde / and that is this / to forgyue and to gyue. Councell is properly and spe¦cially to be taken of these thynges that be to cum, and that be pro¦fytable vnto our ende / that is, to do the werkes of mercy / whiche moost of all corresponde or accorde to the gyfte of councell. And therefore saynte Paule sayeth:1. Timoth. 4. C. Pietas ad omnia vtilis est. Pytye and mercye is profytable to all thynges. And thus ye may perceyue that the beatitude of mercye correspondeth to the gyfte of councell. Nat that this gyfte of councell doeth produce and brynge furthe the werkes of mercye as his effecte and ope∣racion: but that it dyrecteth and orderyth the doer and werker. For the spyryte of councell is specially gyuen to man, to that in∣tent that he shulde lerne therby to forgyue freely and gladly / and also to shew mercy vnto those persons that haue offēdyd agaynst hym, knowynge that yf he so do: he shall fynde lyke mercy in our lorde, in forgyuynge his synnes done agaynst god / as our lorde
sayeth in the gospell.Mat. 6. B. And this is it that we spake before, that men consyderyng and beholdynge the vnspekeable pitie & mercy of our lorde, that he shewed whan he prayed for them that put him to dethe: shulde be moued and styrred to lyke pitie and mercy, & so made apte to the restauracion of the order of aungelles, called vertues. O sayeth the prophete Dauid in the persone of Christe: Calix-meus inebrians quam peclarus est.Psalm. 22. That is, as the glose of saynte Austyn sayeth, the cuppe of the blood of our lorde whiche inebritynge the mynde and makynge it dronken in god, doeth so cure and heale it, that it maketh it forget all vayne delectacion & pleasure. This dronkennes maketh men sobre. This fulnes and plenteousnes maketh men empty and voyde of euyll maners and vyces. And therfore the prophete sayeth, that it is preclarus / that is moche worthy and noble. For besyde the premisses, it bryngeth a man to the kyngedom of heuens. ¶Example of this spyryte and gyfte of councell. The .xv. Chapitre. OF this gyfte of godly councell whiche is gyuen to suche as feruently remembre the passion of Christe, we may se an example in the forsayd blessed woman Maria de Ogines,Li. 31. ca. 39 in the forsayd histories of Vin∣cent / whiche speakynge of this holy woman, sayeth thus. She, endued with the spirite of councell, wold do nothyng hedlynges, nothynge inordinately: but she dyd all thynges dili∣gently, wysely, discretely, and with great deliberacion. And all though she was inwardely vysyted with the familiar councell of the holy goost, and also sufficiently instruct in the holy scripture of god, and all by the feruente and continuall remembraunce of the passion of Christe: yet for thabundaunt mekenes that was in hyr, and that she wolde nat trust to moche to hyr owne wyt, and so seme wise in hyr owne sight: she vtterly forsoke hyr owne wyll and reason, and dysdayned nat to submyt hyr wyll freely & glad∣ly to the wyll and councell of other, takynge and folowyng theyr mynde and councell. This nat withstandynge, many of hyr fa∣mylyar frendes the whiche had ofte experience of hyr godly wys∣dom: wolde take no great thynge vpon them without hyr coun∣cell. And that she coulde nat know by mannes wyt or reason: af∣ter hyr deuout and feruent prayer, she had the knowledge thereof by the inspiracion of god. One tyme whan one of hyr dere spiri∣tuall
frendes whiche had a competent pore lyuynge, wherewith he was well content / & so moche the better content, for that he ly∣ued quyetly from the turmoiles & troubles of the world / abstracte and separate from the cumpany of worldly people, and all world∣ly pompe or vanitie. This person (I say) so content and seruyng god in mekenes and deuoute spyryte▪ was desyred of a noble and great man to be with hym as his maister, instructour, and coun∣cellour / & he shulde haue all thynges plenteously at his pleasure / as meate, drynke, rayment, horse, and seruauntes. This person (after this large offre made) asked councel of this blessed womā Mary what he shulde do. Than she (in no thynge presumynge of hyr owne wyt) made hyr herty prayer to god secretely / and after hyr deuoute prayers, she aunswered to hym and sayde: I sawe a great horse prepared for you / whiche went or ranne streight way towardes hell / & I dyd also se a greate company of deuylles ioy∣enge and shewynge great gladnes thereof. Therefore after my councell, forsake that offre and continue in that callyng that god hathe called you vnto / lesse by suche ambicion & worldly pompe, ye gyue occasion to the deuyll to drawe you further vnto youre eterne perdicion. ¶By the feruent remembraunce of the passion of Christe, the gyfte of vnderstandynge is gyuen to man. The .xvi. Chapytre. THere is also gyuen vnto man (thrughe the feruent and continuall remembraunce of the passion of our lorde, the gyfte and spyryte of vnderstandynge / wherby we know god / nat effēcially as he is in him selfe: but by collacion & comparyson vnto his crea∣tures, as by his effectes, operacions, & creatures / as it were by sygnes and tokens. Also by this gyfte we receyue a lyght and knowledge of those thynges which we se or here of the scripture of god. And this knowledge is contrary to that brute & sensuall knowledge wherby man onely knoweth and cleueth fast to these outwarde and vayne thynges / nothynge regardyng, con∣syderynge, or knowynge his owne honour & dignitie / for he one∣ly consyderyth these visyble and transitory thynges / and wyll nat serche to rede or know inwarde thynges / that is, what he is / nat in substaunce: but in grace. What is his lyuynge, vycyouse or vertuouse. How great he is in merytes or in the fauour of god / &
where he is, that is in this exyle & vale of mysery. All these thyn∣ges considereth the spirituall person / and that by the feruent me∣ditacion of Christes passion. For he that is crucified with Christ Iesu by the remembraunce of his most blessed passion▪ doeth as∣cende vnto the clerenes of knowledge by the spyryte of vnderstan¦dynge / on this maner. Whan a man doeth feruently and deuoutly remembre and consyder how that the sonne of god wolde suffre so greate paynes for to redeme hym: anone he consydereth of what dignitie and noblenes his soule is / that it is of an excellēt & great dignitie / seynge that the sonne of god wolde suffre so shamefull a dethe for the redemption therof. And by this consideracion he is animated and moued to consyder and thynke of hyghe and noble thynges. For whan he depely considereth that that mooste precy∣ouse blood of Iesu Christe was shed to wasshe his soule from the fylthynes of synne / and also that by that moost blessed passion, the ruyne and fall of aungels shulde be repared & restored with man∣kynde: anon he dysdayneth to remēbre or ones to thynke of these vyle and transitorye thynges / but rather he is prouoked & moued to beholde and consydre spirituall and heuenly thynges. And yf he consydre or beholde these visible thynges: it is for that intent that therby he wolde ascende to the cōsideracion of heuenly thyn∣ges / so that his cōuersacion is principally in heuyn. And thā also for asmoche as he seeth Christe crucified and so subdued vnto ma¦nyfolde tribulacions and paynes / he in this consideracion, onely wyllynge to please god: recounteth and thynketh all tribulaciōs and paynes to be very lyght and easy for hym to beare. Remem∣brynge also how moche Christe loued hym that wolde be so cru∣elly and shamefully entreated and slayne for his redemption: he, feruentely kyndeled in the loue of Christe, laboureth to entre in that moost blyssed syde and hert of Christe, whiche he knew was opened with a spere for his loue. His soule is burnyng in loue as a fyre. And therefore with all his herte he desyreth to be crucified with Christe. Hereunto he sygheth and wepyth / and feruently de¦syreth that he myghte be all wasshed or drowned in that passion / and so, hoolly to be transfourmed into his lorde god crucified. He reputeth and thinketh hym selfe to be in bondage and mysery / except he be preserued and kept by the blood of his redemer. He iudgeth hym selfe to be rather more lyke a beeste than a man: ex∣cept he be clad with his lordes passion. It is abhominacion to hym to be negligent in the consideracion and remembraunce of so noble a benefite as is the mercyful werke of our redemption /
and therfore he is euer, or at leest hath a wyll to be euer occupied in the meditacion of the sayd passion. For as he wold euer conti∣nue in the fauoure of god, whiche he gate by that passion and re∣demption: so he wold haue euer in his hert and mynde the passi∣on of Christe, the pryce of our redemption. He reputeth Christe crucified, as his lyfe and all his confort or pleasure / and therfore he wolde be euer conuersaunt with hym. O what sorow, what heuynes is it to that person whiche is inebriate and drowned in the blood of Christe: yf he se his hert enclyned to any other thyng thā to Christe crucified? Therfore suche a {per}son disdeyneth to vse any other potion or drynk with pleasure, but the blood of Christ / whiche hath wasshed hym clene, & greatly beautified & made hym like vnto Christ. He knoweth that thrugh the openyng of the syde or hert of Christe, his soule is maryed vnto Christe / and therfore he wyll euer stande nygh vnto that wounde / touchynge & felynge his spouse wounded for his loue / & so, he feruently desyreth that he myght be wounded in his herte / and therfore he oft tymes lay∣eth his herte vnto those woundes by continuall remembraunce of them / and also ioyneth & byndeth hym selfe vnto his spouse woū∣ded, with the indissoluble and continuall or sure bonde of chari∣tie / for the woūdes of Christ be as a cellar of wynes new broched, whereby our soules may be inebriate or made drunke in charitie. And hereunto it is wrytten in the canticles:Cātic. 2. A. Introduxit me ex in cellam vinariam, ordinauit in me charitatem. The kynge hathe brought me into his wyne cellar / that is, into the feruent loue & remembraunce of his woundes. He hathe made me drunke in his loue and charitie.Cātic. 1. A. Also it is sayd, Canticorum. 1. Introduxit me rex in cellaria sua. The kynge hathe brought me into his cellers. There shall we sucke hony out of the stone / and drynke the moost purest blood of ye grape. Christe crucified is this stone / & also this grape / whereof we all may plenteously drynke. And therefore he sayeth to his louers:Cātic. 5. A. Bibite amici, et inebriamini. Cum drynke frendes hereof at your wyll / and be drunke thereof my moost dere frendes. Also the spouse Christe sayeth to his spousesse oure soule:Cātic. 4. C. Vulnerasti cor meum soror mea sponsa, vulnerasti cor meum. Thou haste wounded my hert for thy loue, my syster, my spouse / thou haste wounded my hert.Ibidē. 2. A. sermon. 70. And she agayne wounded with his loue, sayeth in lyke maner: Vulnerata charitate ego sum, ideo{que} fi∣lis Ierusalem nunciate dilecto quia amore langueo. I am woūded with charitie / and therfore ye doughters of Ierusalem shew vnto my dere beloued spouse Christe that I languysshe and am syckeCātic. 5. C.
for loue. And so the wounded spouses is ioyned to Christe cruci∣fied her wounded spouse / and wounde is coupled to woūde / that is loue to loue. And than also the columbyne blood of the spouse / that is of Christe / whiche is symple as the downe / by the whiche bloode our soule (the spousesse of god) receyueth hyr spirituall syght. This blood I say doeth flow into the woūdes of the spou∣sesse / whiche is so wounded by compassion that she hathe of hyr spouse Christ crucified: that in a maner she fainteth & swowneth for sorow / and mylteth or waxeth sycke for the loue of his spouse / and so than she swetely resteth in our sauiuor Iesu / where she re∣deth and seeth / vnderstandeth and fyndeth what she is / & of what meryte or dignitye in the loue and fauour of god / for whose loue the sonne of god wolde suffre so great and greuouse tourmentes. Hereunto speaketh saynte Bernarde: O good Iesu / thou haste made thy body, as a glasse vnto my soule. That whiche thou dyd suare openly: I suffred pryuely. That whiche thou suffred of the ministers of Cayphas openly: I suffred of the ministers of wic∣kednes of Sathanas inwardely. Thy face was couered, and al∣so smyten or buffeted in the house of the prince of prestes / and that was to put away the confusion of our ignoraunce and spirituall blyndenes. We were sumtyme darknes / that was before our bap∣tisme / but nowe we walke in the lyght that was set or hanged vp on height vppon the aulter or candelstycke of the crosse / and from thence shyneth very bryght vnto our conforte. And so Christe by his passion doeth illuminate or lyghten our reason & vnderstan∣dynge.Apoc. 3. D. This is the ointement, wherewith (as saynt Iohn̄ say∣eth) our iyen shulde be anointed, that we myght se clerely. This is also the rodde,1. Regū. 14. D. wherewith Ionathas toke of the hony and ate thereof: and so his iyen were lyghtenyd. This is more ouer the gall of the fysshe wherwith Thobie anointed his iyen:Thob. 6. B 11. C. and so re∣ceyued his syght agayne. And so Longyne beynge blynde, and wasshed with the blood of Christe: receyued his syght, and was also conuerted to the faythe. And so ye may perceyue howe the passion of Christe doeth illuminate our vnderstandyng, and gy∣ueth knowledge to meke persons, faythfully and deuoutly remē∣bryng his passion. And this is thrugh the gyft of vnderstandyng to know god by his creatures / or in comparyng hym to his crea∣tures / as we sayd before. And also to be illuminat or lyghtened by the wrytynges and saynges of prophetes in the maner of contem¦placion or knowledge of those thynges that be wryten of our lord Iesu Christe / whereby man begynneth to retourne to his owne
selfe / for by this gyfte of vnderstandynge, he recouereth his spi∣rituall syght / wherby he may se and know his owne honour and dignitie / & so retourne to his lorde god and se hym as it is possi∣ble for man in this lyfe. And therefore to this gyfte correspondeth the .vi. beatitude / that is, Beati mundo corde: quoniam ipsi deum videbunt.Mat. 5. A. Blessyd be the pure & clene in hert: for they shall se god. And saynt Austen sayeth that the syxt operacion or gyft of the ho∣ly goost / that is the gyfte of vnderstandynge, is conuenient and accordyng to them that be pure in hert. For they so clensed & made pure: may knowe & se that, whiche the corporall iye or syght can nat se. And here note, that there be two maners of clennes of the herte. One is as a disposicion to the syght of god / which is a clen∣syng of the wyll or affecte from all mordinate affections / and this clennes is made or goten by the gyftes and vertues that perteyn to the wyll / comonly called Vis anime appetitiua. The desyrouse power of the soule. There is an other clennes of the hert, which is as a complete & perfyce clennes / whereby god is sene. And this is the clennes of the mynde or vnderstandynge purified & clensed from all fantasyes & errours / so that the soule so purified, percey∣ueth the more clerely & truely those thynges that be wryten or spo¦ken of god / & nat onely perceyueth them by corporall fantasies, ne yet vnderstandeth them as the peruerse and obstinate heretykes done declare them. And this clennes is opteyned or goten by the gyfte of vnderstandyng / wherunto correspondeth (as I sayd be∣fore) the .vi. beatitude / that is, Blessyd be the clene in herte: for they shall se god. And faythe or fidelitie / one of the fruytes of the spyryt, accordeth also hereunto. And as ye se that the fruite of the tree is the last thynge and moost delectable or pleasaunt that we haue of the fruitfull tree: so be the fruites of ye holy goost the most pleasaunt & delectable thynges that cummeth to man by the ver∣tue and operacion of the holy gooste. And so the spirite of vnder∣stadynge, cummynge to the soule of man thrugh the deuout and ofte remembraunce of Christes passion: clenseth it and purifieth the inwarde and spirituall syght of man / whiche was derked and blynded by the synne of our fyrst parent Adam / and also doth cure and heale it with the knowledge of the worde of god / as it were with an holsum ointement / and doeth make it so pure and lyght∣sum, that it is apte to receyue or to beholde the clearenes of the deytie.Mat. 5. A. Clennes doeth sprynge of the gyfte of vnderstandynge. And this clennes bryngeth in the vision or syght of god / and ther∣fore Christe sayeth: Blessyd be the clene in herte: for they shall se
And therfore we sayd before, that by the truth expressed & declared in the moost blessyd passion of Christe: men be illuminate thrugh the feruent remēbraūce of the sayd passion, vnto the knowledge of the heuenly and godly truthes / that so they may be made apte vnto the reparacion of thorder of Cherubyn. For man in his fyrst creacion was so made of god, that yf he had nat synned: he shulde euer haue ben presente in the contemplacion of his creatoure and maker / that man, so seynge his lorde god: shulde euer haue lo∣uyd hym / and so louynge hym: shulde euer haue cleued fast vnto hym. And in so cleuyng fast to hym, whiche is immortall: he also shuld haue had lyfe euerlastyngly. But man, for his inobedience, was cast from the face & fauour of god. And by his synne, he was blynded with ignoraūce. And he was put from that inward light of cōtemplacion / bycause he inclined his mynde & gaue it to erth∣ly desyres. And the more depely he gaue hym selfe to the desyre of these vaine & transitory thynges: the more he forgat the swetenes of heuenly desyres, whose taste and knowledge he had lost by his syn. And so he was exiled & banisshed from Paradise, for his syn∣full conscience / and wandred about here in this vale of misery, by inordinate concupiscence. And also the hert of man whiche fyrste, fyxed in the loue of god, was than stable & permanēt, & in louyng onely one thynge, that is god, was at all tymes one: after that it began to slyde vnto vayne & worldly desyres, it was diuided in∣to as many thinges, as thoo thinges that he desyred were dyuers & many. And so it foloweth consequently, that yt mynde which can nat or wyll nat loue yt one thyng, yt is very good & one in it selfe: yt mynde (I say) can neuer be stable. For ye mynde, nat fyndyng the ende of his desyre & his purpose in those thynges yt he loueth / & so euer labouryng in vayne, & desyryng that thyng which he can nat opteyn: can neuer rest stably & quietly. And herof foloweth conti¦nuall mouyng without stabilitie, labour without rest, runnyng without any ende of his runnyng. And so the hert is euer vnquy∣et, vnto the tyme it cleue fast by loue vnto one thyng, in the which his desyre shall be saciate & fully content with pleasure / and also he shall haue a sure confidence and trust, that that thynge whiche he so loueth, shall neuer be taken from hym / & this shalbe by our lorde Iesu Christe / whiche is the way,Ioh. 14. A. truthe and lyfe eternall. And therfore he sayth:Ioh. 12. E. Cum exaltatus fuero a terra omnia traham ad meipsum. Whan I shalbe exalted vpon the crosse: I shall draw all my elect people to my self. And this his eternall father promy∣sed vnto hym by the prophet,Esay. 43. A sayenge: Ab oriente adducam semen
tuum. &c. That is, I shall brynge thy sede and faythfull chyldren or seruantes from the Eest, by one parte of the crosse. And I shall gader to the from the west, by an other arme or parte of the crosse. And I shall say vnto Northe: Gyue to my sonne his seruauntes by the thyrde parte of the crosse. And I shall saye to the Southe parte of the worlde: Let nat my sonnes seruantes to cum to hym, by the fourthe arme or parte of the crosse. Brynge my sonnes or chyldren from farre cuntreys / and my doughters from thextreme and vtttermoost partes of the erthe. ¶Example of this gyfte or spyryte of vnderstan∣dynge. The .xvii. Chapytre OF this spirite of vnderstandyng, whiche is oft tymes gy∣uen to those that deuoutly remēbre the passion of Christ: we haue example in the sayd hystoryes of Vincent,Li. 31. ca. 41 of the ofte named holy woman Maria de Ogines. Of whome he sayeth thus▪ This blessyd doughter of Hierusalem, adourned by the feruent remēbraunce of Christes passion with manyfolde vertues, & illustrate or lyghtenyd with the foresayd gyftes of the holy goost, and also hyr herte purified & clensed with the gyfte of vnderstandyng: she was conuersant in & with heuenly thynges. For she, vtterly excludynge from hyr hert all vayne, transitory, & sensuall fātasies: gat into hyr mynde vniforme, vnuariable, & he∣uenly imaginaciōs. And the more she ap{pro}ched & drew nigh vnto thimmutable maiesty of god: the more purely these heuenly ima∣ginacions shone in hyr soule. And whā hyr spirit so purified was kyndled & burnynge in the fyre of feruent loue of god: she ascēded into heuen by contemplacion, as the fume or smoke of insence or other swete spices doth ascende / & so walkyng in heuen as it were from place to place euer ascendynge, sought about to fynde hym whom she loued, god omnipotent. And so serchynge, she was sū∣tyme cōforted with ye lilies of vyrgins. Now refresshed with tho∣diferouse & swete smellyng roses of the holy martyrs. And sūtyme she is venerably or worshipfully receiued of thonorable cūpany of the aples / & sumtyme she is associate to the cūpany of aungels. Whan she had thus ascendyd frō degree to degree, & walked with ioyouse & glad mynde thrughe many places of heuenly paradise: whan she was a lytle past all these cūpanies: she foūde hym whō hyr hert moost feruently desyred / & there she perfitely restyd. And whan she was in this quietnes: it pleased our lorde to shew vnto hyr the boke of lyfe / wherin whan she loked: she perceyued many thynges by the spirite of vnderstandyng / whiche afterward whā
she was cum to hyr selfe, she shewed by the spirit of prophecy. And so vpō a tyme, whan the heretikes called Albigenses were great∣ly multiplied, thre yeres before that the people were marked with the signe of the crosse to go & fyght against them: she sayd that she se many crosses descende from heuen vppon a great multitude of people / whiche people moued of god, & feruent zele that they had to our sauiour crucified, & intendyng to reuenge the great disho∣nour of god, don by those heretykes: cam frō farre cuntreys. And whan they cam to a place called Mons gaudii, the mount of ioy: there were many of theym slayne by the heretikes. And than this blyssed woman, though she were in a farre cuntrey from yt place: yet she se holy aungels makynge great ioye, & bearynge the sou∣les of those holy martyrs that were slayne in that battell, vnto he∣uyn, without any other purgatorye. And so this blessyd woman seynge this: conceyued so feruent desyre to go vnto that place, yt no thynge shulde haue withholde hyr frome that iourney: yf she myght haue gone without slaunder of hyr neighbours. And whā we with smylynge countenaunce asked of hyr, what she wold do if she were there: she answered & sayd: Though I can nat fight: yet at leest I wolde there honour & glorifie my lorde god, & there confesse his name, where as those wicked heretikes hath blasphe∣myd hym and denyed hym. Other examples ye may se in the sayd histories. Ca. xlii. ¶The gyfte of wysdome is gyuen to man by the deuout remembraunce of Christes passion. The .xviii. Chapitre. THere is also gyuen to man by the deuout and ofte remembraunce of Christes passion: the spyryte or gyfte of godly wysdom. Wherwith god is knowen absolutely without respecte vnto his creatures / or els by experience. As whan we taste of the swete∣nes of god. And therefore Sapientia is nat onely called a knowledge: but it is a sauoury knowlege, thrughe the taste of vertues. And this gyfte is gyuen to man, agaynste all chyldely or vayne knowledge or pleasure / so that hereby a man lerneth to dispise all wantonnes, and mylke of temporall delecta∣cion or pleasure, and all suche folysshnes / & begynneth to sauour heuenly thynges, and to pondre them as thynges very pleasant, true, and stable, or permanent. And erthly thynges he reputeth as
vayne & transitory / and also hereby he iudgeth the truthe of euery thyng as it is in dede / & intermedleth no more than nedeth. And of this wysdom saynt Paule sayeth:Colo. 1 B. Impleamini cognitione volun∣tatis dei in omni sapientia, et intellectu spirituali. I praye (sayeth saynt Paule) yt ye may be replenisshed & fulfilled with the know∣ledge of ye wyll of god in all wisdom & spirituall vnderstandyng. And saynt Bernarde sayeth,Ser. 15. de diuersis. that there be .iii. maners of wysdom. One is the wysdom of the hert. An other is ye wisdom of ye mouth. And the thyrde is of the outwarde werke or dede. The wysdom of the hert standeth in the wepynge & sorowyng for our synnes past / in dispisyng of all wordly pleasures or profites, & in the desyre of heuenly thynges & eternall glory. The wysdom of the mouth cō∣sisteth in ye confession of our synnes / in the laude & praysynges of god, & in thediienge of our neighbour by godly speche & exhorta¦cion. The wysdom of outwarde werkes standeth in this yt a man lyue & be conuersant with other men paciently, obediently, & in∣nocently or continently / so that faithfull & true obedience do mor∣tifie & subdue his owne proper wyl. Meke continēce do cut away all carnall & worldly cōcupiscence. And glad pacience do sustayn & beare manly & strongly all corporall & worldly aduersitie.Capi. 10. A. Of the wysdom of the herte, we may declare vnto you a figure or ex∣ample wrytten in the thyrde boke of the kynges / that is, how the quene Saba, hearyng the great fame of Salomon: cam from ye extreme partes of the erthe to here his wysdom / & she cam to hym with a great cumpany. And kynge Salomon taughte hyr in all thynges that requyred of hym. And so she seynge and conside∣rynge the wysdom, his house that he had builded, his ministers and seruauntes, & thorder of them, theyr rayment, his buttelers, and thostes or oblacions that he dayly offred: she (I say) conside¦ryng all these, hyr spirite in a maner failed hyr, for great maruell and wonder she had therof. Morally or spiritually by this quene Saba is vnderstond our synfull soule / which heryng of the fame of Salomon / that is, by inwarde inspiracion or outwarde pre∣chynge or redynge, perceyuynge thinfinite goodnes, loue, and mercy of our peacefull Salomon Christe, by the whiche mercy & loue he hath preuented our synfull soule with his grace / & recon¦syled it to his heuēly father. And where our soule by our fyrst pa∣rentes was condempned vnto eternall dethe: he hathe restored & called it agayne vnto lyfe. Our quene Saba and synfull soule (I say) perceyuyng this great fame, is incited & moued to cum with all hyr hert and mynde, with a great and muche cumpany / that is,
with many sighynges & sobbynges, & great desyres vnto our true Salomon Christ, from thextreme partes of the erthe / that is, frō synne / that is very farre from god. As the prophete Dauid sayth: Longe a peccato ibus salus.Psalm. 118. Helth or saluacion / that is Christe, is farre from synners. And therfore synne is called thextreme part of the erthe: for asmuche as it separateth & maketh man farre from god / yea nothynge so moche / & also bycause synne comonly doeth inhabit the soules of erthly & worldly people. This synfull quene I say cam fro farre to here the wysdom of our Salomon Christ. And his wysdom is this / that we shulde be  & sory for our synnes, dyspyse the worlde with all his pleasures, & couet or de∣syre heuenly thynges / that all thynges shuld sauour vnto vs / that is, that we shuld iudge & take euery thyng as it is in it selfe / after ryght reason. Also our Salomon Christ doth teche vnto vs, that yf we wyll auoyde eternall tourmentes & paynes: we must feare the iustice of god, remembre oftymes the surety of dethe, and the vncertaynty of the hour of dethe / & to be asshamed to cum to euer∣lastyng infamy and rebuke. Also he techeth vs to haue discrecion in our elections, actes, & debes / that is to preferre spirituall thyn∣ges before corporall / eternall, before temporall / heuenly, before erthly / & honest thynges, before vyle & vnhonest thynges. This is the wysdom of our Salomon Christe / this is farre from the wys∣dom of the worlde.1. Cor. 1. C. And therfore saint Paule sayeth: Vbi sapiens vbi scriba? &c. Where is the wyse man of the worlde? where is the scrybe and lerned man? Where is the buylder & purchaser of this worlde? Hath nat god also shewed & declared the wysdom of this world to be a folysshnes? Surely that wysdom may wel be called a folysshnes, wherby the worlde is loued, & god dispised. Worldly honours ben coueted & desyred: & good maners lost & distroyed / wherby ryches is gotē: but good cōscience is lost & blynded. But now let vs se how this trew wysdom of the hert may be goten by the remēbraūce of Christes passion. For who so euer be crucified with Christ thrugh ye deuout & continuall remēbrance of his pas∣sion: he may ascēde vnto high contēplacion by the gyft of wysdō / on this maner, folowyng thistory & exāple of quene Saba. First our quene Saba, our synfull soule, doth here ye fame of ye wysdō & goodnes of Christ our Salomon, whan she remēbreth how ye son of god was incarnat & becum mā, & also suffred manifold paines, & was offred vpon ye crosse for our sinnes / & how yt he suffred most greuouse paines & shamefull dethe for our redemption. And ther∣fore she thynketh that no wyse man wolde gladlye or lyghtely
lese that thynge whiche he bought so derely with his owne pre∣ciouse blood, yf he might with any iustice or ryghtfully kepe it. And so considerynge these: she conceyueth in hyr selfe a hope and trust of forgiuenes. And thā she maketh hyr supplicacion & prayer to god for his fauour & grace / & promyseth to make amendes for hyr offences & synnes, as farre as it is possible for hyr to do. Thā she beholdeth & considereth his house that our Salomon hathe made / that is, hyr owne body & soule / & how hyr soule is made to that intent, that it shulde be the house & temple of the holy goost. Also she cōsidereth how gloryous & goodly this house was made / that is, to thimage & similitude of god. And how vylely & shame∣fully she hath defoiled it by hyr owne synne. And so she beginneth to haue wonder & maruell of the great mercy of god, that so mer∣cyfully wolde spare the synfull soule. Secondly, she beholdeth ye meates of his table or borde / that is, she cōsidereth how merciful∣ly he doeth nouryssh & fede synners with his benefites / though in¦dede they be nat worthy to haue the bread that they eate. Thyrd∣ly, our synfull Saba considereth his ministers & seruantes / that is, she seeth how all creatures were create and made of god for to do seruyce vnto man / and how they contynue they obedience and seruyce vnto man, though man be inobedient vnto his lorde god creatour & maker / and so for his inobedience and synne: vnwor∣thy the seruice of any creature. Fourthely she considereth theyr vestures and garmentes / that is, how mercyfully our lorde hy∣therto hath hyd and couered the priuy sinnes of our synfull soule / though all thynges ben open to his syght and knowledge. Fyfte∣ly, she seynge his buttlers: doeth consyder howe benignely our lorde god doeth byrle and gyue to vs the wyne of contricion and deuocion.Psalm. 59. And therefore the prophete Dauid sayeth: Potasti nos vino compunctionis. Thou haste gyuen vs to drynke the wyne of compunction and sorow for our synnes. Syxtely, she beholdeth the oblacions that our Salomon doeth dayly offre / that is, how Christ offred hym selfe freely vpon the aulter of the crosse for our synnes / and how the same body and bloode is dayly offered in the chyrche for our spirituall conforte. And this oblacion excedeth all the other benefites of god gyuen to man. And thus our quene Saba, our synnefull soule, hauynge the iyen of hyr wysdome in hyr hede Christe / that is, beholdynge and depely considerynge all the premisses: she faynted, and hyr spyryte fayled hyr. She had no spyryte / that is of synne & iniquitie / for that hath now lefte hyr. And bicause now the holy spirite of god hath entred into that
soule: the wycked and vnclene spirite is expelled and put away. And now finally, as Salomon gaue to the quene of Saba many great & precyouse gyftes: so our kyng that hath wrought our sal∣uacion in the myddest of the erth, doeth gyue vnto the soule depe∣ly remēbryng the premisses, great treasures of knowledge & wys∣dom of vertue & grace / & that moche more thā she deserueth or as∣keth. For whan a man inwardly considereth how he yt was most myghty of power, was so dispiteously troden vnder fote for our synnes. He that was most wyse, was deluded & mocked as a fole. He that was best and all full of goodnes, was replenisshed with the bytternes of sorow. And he that was moost rightuouse, to be cōdempned to the moost shamefull dethe. Whan a man (I say) cō∣sidereth all these thynges: anon the mynde aryseth into a greate meruell & admiracion of ye worthynes & noblenes of god / wonde∣rynge & meruelynge of the great benignitie & charitie of god to∣wardes vs moost wretched and vnworthy seruauntes. And than begynneth the mynde with a ferueent desyre and burnynge loue to be kyndled towardes our lorde god. And the spirituall taste of our affection in a meruelouse maner is made moche pleasant and swete / and our appetyte is wonderfully refresshed. And so all our inwarde man is in a maner alienate & lyfte vp from hymself / and quietly doeth rest in our lorde Iesu. O, a meruelouse thynge and neuer herde or sene before / that is, that vnspeakable swetenes shuld be founde in the moost bytternes. The moost bytter bytternes of our dere beloued sauioure Iesu is meruelously turned in our lo∣uynge mynde / into a swetenes yt can nat be expressed / rauysshyng and takynge into it the hole spirite of man / so that that swetenes ones tasted: all carnall and worldly pleasure waxeth all vnsauo∣ry, and is excluded. And in this swetenes is the speculacion or wysdom of the person, contemplatynge & beholdynge our lordes passion, made perfite. For herin he ioyneth & putteth to gydre the hyghe & inenarrable swetenes that he feleth in the consideracion & beholdyng of that infinite goodnes of god / that it wolde please hym to suffre so vyle a dethe for vs, with that inestimable bytter∣nes that he felte or feleth in hauynge compassion of the paynes & sorowes of his lorde Iesu crucified. And note here that that byt∣ternes of compassion of Christes passion, doeth gader in & vnyt the mynde of man. And thadmiracion or wonderful consideraci∣on of the great goodnes of god in the same passion: doeth eleuate & lyft vp the mynd so vnit and gadred in, & offre it holly vnto god. And for asmoche as therin is founde & perceyued an vnspekable
bytternes with an vnspekable swetenes: therfore the mynd of the person that beholdeth & considereth this, wondereth at it / & so is alienated from hym selfe, & rauisshed aboue hym selfe / & lyke as yf he were all drunke, he falleth vnto his lorde god / where than the soule melted with loue / thrughe the beholdynge of thinestimable charitie & loue of god, is made as moost pure golde, purified in the hore furneys. And in the consideracion of ye most excellent be∣nignitie & goodnes of god, the soule is anointed & made fat with the moost pleasant oyle of grace. It also obumbrate & shadowed with that  of iustice: is made moost shynynge. The soule also clensed and gadred in with that great bytternes: is abstract & withdrawē from all bytternes & sorow. That soule beholden & receyued of god all good: is made all godly / & so at last, it is ab∣sorpt and rauysshed with an vnspekable ioye & meruelouse swete∣nes. And the spousesse doeth reste swetely with hyr spouse / and a∣monges those pleasaunte and swete enbracynges, she may than sucke and drynke of the fountaynes of our sauiour, the lyuely wa¦ters and true wysdome. And here note that it perteyneth to this gyfte of wysdom, nat onely to beholde & consyder godly & heuen∣ly thynges: but also to rule and order the actes and operacions of man. In the whiche direction and order, fyrst it aperteyneth to a∣uoyde all euyll & vyce / that be contrary vnto trew wysdome. And therfore the feare of god is called the begynnyng of wysdom: for asmuche as it causeth a man to auoyde all euyll and synne. The last thynge perteynynge to wysdom, or the ende of wysdom: is to reduce all thynges to a due order and ende / and this perteyneth to peace.Li. 19. de ci∣uitate dei. capit. 13. For as saynte Austyn sayeth: Peace is a tranquilitie of order / that is, whan all thynges ben brought to a quyet & due or∣der. And therfore conueniently correspondeth to this gyft of wys∣dom the .vii. beatitude that Christe speaketh of,Mat. 5. A. sayenge: Beati pacifici: quoniam filii dei vocabūtur. Blessed be the peacefull that make peace: for they shall be called the chylderen of god. And saynt Austyn sayeth,Li. 1. de ser. di in mon∣te. C. wysdome is agreynge and acordynge to the peacefull. In whom is no contrary mouyng or rebellyng / but his mouinges ben subdued & obedient to reason. Sapientia is called a sauory sciēce / & so he hath his name a sapore of ye sapour / sauour or taste / as whan the mynde is touched with the taste of inwarde swetenes: he doeth gader in, hym selfe all hole, by desyre to rest therin / lesse yf ye mynde shuld wandre in ye cōsideraciō of outward thing{is}, it shuld shortly be dissolued by inordinat plesure of ye body or of ye world / & therfore he gadreth hym self all inward / for within
he hath that thynge in whome is all his delectacion and pleasure. And therefore the spyryte of wysdom, whan he toucheth the herte with his swetenes, he tempereth outwardly the feruour & hete of concupiscence / & so the concupiscence subdued: he maketh peace inwardly / to thintent that the mynd of man so hoolly gadred into that inwarde ioye: myght fully and perfitely be refourmed vnto thymage of god.Mat. 5, A. And therfore it is wryten: Blessed be the peace∣full: for they shall be called the chylderen of god. And that, for as muche as they haue the similitude of the naturall and onely sonne of god.Rom. 8. F. As saint Paule sayth: Quos presciuit conformes fieri ima∣ginis filii sui. Our lorde hath predestinate and knowen before, his chyldren here in erthe, to be cōforme or made lyke vnto thymage of his naturall sonne / whiche is called Sapientia generata. The eternally begotten wysdome of the father. And so herby ye may perceyue that those persons whiche receyue the gyfte of wysdom by the deuout and continuall meditacion of Christes passion: at∣tayne to be the chyldren of god.Capitul. 2. huius part. And this is it that we sayd before, that the great charitie of god that apered in the passion of Christ, shulde kyndle the fyre of loue to wardes god & theyr neighbours, in the hertes of all them that deuoutly remembre the same passiō / that thereby they myght be made apte vnto the reparacion of the order of aungelles called Seraphin. ¶Here foloweth an example of this spirite of wysdom. The .xix. Chapytre. EXample of this spyryte or gyfte of wysdome we rede in the hystoryes of Vincente / whiche wrytynge the lyfe of the ofte named Maris de Ogines,Li. 31. ca. 43 sayeth in this maner. Hyr herte (thrughe the remembraunce of Christes passion) was inwardely fulfylled with the spyryte of wysdome / whereby hyr wordes were very swete & confortable / and all hyr werkes were made fatte or pleasant with a meruelouse swetenes of the spirituall vnction or ointement. She was meke in herte, mylde in hyr countenaunce, swete in hyr wordes, pleasaunt in all hyr werkes, and drunken in chari∣tie. One tyme, whan she had lyen thre days cōtinually in hyr bed, there restynge mooste swetely with hyr spouse Iesus Christe: hyr ioye and sweatenes was so vehemente, that she knewe nat how the tyme passed / and so she supposed that she had scarcely ly∣en the tenthe parte of one quarter of an houre.
She had many meuelouse and dyuers affections vnto our lord. Sumtyme she was very hungery for god / and sumtyme merue∣louse thyrsty and drye for god. And the more she had hym or felte hym: the more her desyre dyd encrease. And whan he wolde de∣parte from hyr: than she was sorowfull / than she cryed and desy∣red hym to remayne and continue with hyr / & sumtyme she wolde enbrace and hold hym fast in her armes, that he shuld nat departe from her / and with many teares beseched hym that he wolde shew hym selfe more ofte tymes to hyr. Sumtyme by thre days or more (as it was sene to hyr) he appered to hyr as a lytle chylde lyenge betwyxt hyr brestys / whom she enbraced and halsed / and hyd hym that he shulde nat be sene of other persons / and so she lay kyssyng and playenge with hym as with a chylde. Sumtyme he appered as a mylde lambe / layeng his hed in her lappe. Sumtyme our sa∣uioure appered to hyr as a dowue to conforte hyr. Sumtyme she se hym as a shepe or a wedder with a bright sterre in his forehed / goynge about the chyrche to vysyte and conforte his seruauntes / as she thought. And in dyuerse solempne festes of our lorde he ap¦pered in dyuerse maners, accordyngly vnto the feest. As on Chri∣stēmasse day, he appered to hyr as a chyld, suckyng his mothers brestes / or lyenge in ye cradell / and than hyr affections was orde∣red to hym as to a chylde / and so accordynge to dyuers apparici∣ons, she had dyuerse affections / and so thrughout all the festes of the yere. In the feeste of the Purificacion of our lady, comonly called Candylmas day: she se our blyssed lady offre hyr sonne in the Temple / and how Simeon toke hym in his armes. And in this vision she had no lesse ioye than yf she had ben present at the sayd oblacion whan it was actually don in the Temple of Ieru∣salem. And in the procession of this same feest, whan hyr candell was extyncte and without lyght by a long space of tyme: sodeyn∣ly there cam a great and most clere lyght from heuen, & dyd light hyr taper or candell. On good fryday he appered to hyr as cruci∣fyed and hangynge vpon the crosse / but very seldome he appered to hyr on this maner, bicause she coulde nat beholde it / hyr sorow was so great:Capit. 44. that she was ofte thereby in peryll of dethe. And whan any solempne feest by the course of the yere drew nygh: sū∣tyme. viii. dayes before that feest, she felt in hyr soule a great ioy. And so she had diuersities of affections, accordynge to the diuer∣sitie of feestes after the course of the yere.Capit. 45. She se also sumtyme as it were bryght beames cummynge from thymage of the cruci∣fixe dyrectly vnto hyr / and so entred into hyr hert. And in all these
thyng{is} she had great delectacion & pleasure / & hyr spirit was mer∣uelously cōforted therwith.Capi. 46. This blessed woman also was moche wery of this miserable life / & also was in a maner cōtinually sicke for ye feruēt loue that she had to god, & cōtinuall desire to be in his presence, with him in eternall felicitie. But yet in al these desires, werynes of this exyle or worlde: she had one singuler & speciall confort & remedie to refressh hyr in this vale of misery, vnto suche tyme she might cum vnto that she moost desyred / that is, she had the heuenly Manna / aungels food / the sacrament of the auter / the very body & blood of hyr dere beloued spouse Iesu Christe. This was hyr continuall confort in all hyr troubles. She lerned by ex∣perience in this worlde that whiche Christe sayd in his gospell: Nisi manducaueritis carnem filii hominis et biberitis eius saguinē:Iohā. 6. F. non habebitis vitam in vobis. That is, Except yt ye eat the flessh of the sonne of a vyrgyn, & drynke his blood: ye shal nat haue lyfe in you. Nor this sayenge was sene to hyr very harde or vnreaso∣nable, as it was to the Iues: but rather very swete & pleasaunt. For in this holy Māna she founde all pleasure & all delectable sa∣uour & tast by ye receyuyng therof / nat onely in hyr soule: but also it was to hyr mouthe as swete as hony. And nat only she had this great confort in the receyuyng of this most blyssed sacramēt: but also in the syght therof. And therfore, after the tyme that ye preest had sayd mase: she desyred hym to leue the chaleys bare & vnco∣uered vpon the auter / to thintent that she, seynge it: myght haue more perfyte mynde of the blood and passion of Christe. Many other exāples ye may se in the forsayd boke of this blessed womā. ¶The .vi. particle. Of the settynge of our lorde vpon the asse, and vpon hyr foole or colte MAny misteries & prophecies were spoken & writen by the holy prophetes which were fulfylled by our sauiour Ie∣su Christe. One of them we shall shewe vnto you in this chapitre / & how it was fulfylled in Christ. Whan ye tyme drew nigh that our sauiour Iesus had determyned to redeme the worlde with his precyouse bloode: that was the feast of Pasche / at whiche feaste the Paschall lambe shulde be offered accordynge to thordinaūce of god: our sauiour Iesu as the very true lambe, signified by the other lābe, wold also voluntarily approche & cum nigh vnto ye place of his passion, where as he wolde be offred for the redemption of man. In that dede shewynge that he was moost redy to obey vnto the wyll of his father, and to meke hym
to the most shamefull & moost painefull dethe for our saluacion. And what tyme it pleased his goodnes to take this iourney: we may mekely byleue, that our lady moued of hyr motherly affecti∣on: wold haue withdrawen hym & reteyned hym from that iour∣ney. And in lyke maner his disciples (as we may suppose) persua∣ded hym to the same / but he had other wyse disposed for all our sal∣uacion.Mat. 21. A. Wherfore in goyng toward{is} Hierusalem, he went by the mount of Oliuet / to signifie yt onely of pitie & mercy, & nat of ne∣cessitie,Su{per} Mat. 26. he cam to his passiō. This mount (as saint Hierom say∣eth) is called the moūt of Oliuet: for asmoche as there dyd grow many Oliues / of the which is made bothe creme & oile / & by yt oile ye light of ye lampe is norisshed. And so it may be called ye mount of oile, creme, & of light / & that to signifie the .iii. effectes of Christes passiō / ye is. In ye oile, is signified mercy & forgyuenes. In creme is signified ye vnction of grace. And by the light, is noted ye lyght of eternall glory. And these effectes we haue by ye merites of Chri∣stes passion. Frō this mount he sent .ii. of his apostles, signifieng the .ii. generall cōmaūdementes of loue, wherby all mankynde is absolued from syn / yt is, thou shalt loue thy lorde god with all thy herte. &c. The seconde is, yu shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe. By these .ii. preceptes, yf they bē truely kept: all syn is expelled / & all iustice is performed. And he sayd vnto his .ii. apostles, go vn∣to yt castell that is against you / that is before your face at ye fote of ye mount of Sion. He sayd yt that castell was against them or con¦trary to thē / & that was true / for there they suffred moche cōtradic¦tion & many rebukes & also betynges / as it is wryten in thactes of thapostles.Act. 5. D. G. And there ye shall fynde an asse tyed, & hyr foole or colt with hyr / the which colt was neuer ryden / lawse thē, & bryng thē to me. Spiritually, this castell signifieth ye world. The disciples signifieth the preachers. For the worlde is euer contrary to ye pre∣chers. The worlde loueth & foloweth ryches, honours, & vayne pleasures. Cōtrary, the prechers do preche pouerty, abiection, & penaūce. The asse for hir folisshnes, signifieth ye people of ye Iues. And ye colte yt was wilde & wanton, signifieth ye gentiles for theyr {pro}nitie to syn & custom of ye same. The asse is a beest vnclene, rude, folyssh, & weike in hyr former part{is} / though she be strong behynd. These bestes were boūde. So was all mankynde before ye cum∣mynge of Christ, bounde in the euyll custom of syn / whiche bonde is mooste stronge of all other. For where as other bondes whan they be olde: they putrifie and so cum to noughte / but this bonde of synne / the longer it continueth: the stronger it is.
There was neuer man that sat vppon this colte / for the gentyles were neuer subdued to any reasonable law gyuen by god. Lawse them by your godlye and heuenly doctrine, from theyr errours & synnes: and brynge them to me / enformed in true faythe & vertu∣ouse maners / that they, lawsed from the bondes of theyr synnes: myght folow me in godly lyuynge. And whan our lorde shuld haue rydden vpon this asse or hyr colte: his disciples cast or put theyr garmentes vpon these beestes / signifienge that our sauiour Iesu wolde nat reste or sytte vppon the naked soule: excepte it fyrste be clad and coueryd with the doctryne and vertuouse ma∣ners of thexaposles. Morally by this asse may be signified our body / whiche is dull or rude, folysshe, vnclene, weake before / yt is to spirituall and heuenly thynges / and stronge behynde / that is, to temporall and vayne thynges. And by the colte, may be signified our carnall affection and vayn desyre. And these bestes ben tyed with inordinate pleasures. But we must lawse them by the feare of god / and prepare them with morall vertues and wor∣thy fruites of penaunce:Psalm. 72. that our lorde may rest & syt vpon them / so that eche one of vs myght say with the Prophete: Vt iumentū factus sum apud te. I am made as a beest vnto the, redy to bere ye / therefore lay vppon vs what bourden it shall please the: and we shall bere it. And contrary wyse, let vs here what saynte Paule sayth to vs:1. Cor. 6. D. Empti estis precio magno, portate Christum in corpo∣re vestro. Ye be bought with a great and dere pryce / therefore bere Christe in  bodies, paciently sufferynge his visitacion in au∣thynges. By those that brought this asse & hyr colt vnto Christ: may be signified those penitentes whiche do offre & brynge theyr bodies to god by due mortificacion / and theyr soules by true con∣tricion. As the bodye is signified by the asse: so may the synfull soule be signified by the colte. Our lorde and sauiour Iesu, for to declare and shew his myldenes and mekenes, wolde nat ryde vpon a proude and highe horse: but as he was mylde and meke: so wolde he ryde vpon a mylde and homely beest, vppon an asse / to signifie also that he wyll nat rest in proude and wrathefull sou∣les:Mat. 21. A. but in the meke and quyete soules. All this was done (as the Euangelyst sayeth) to fulfyll the Prophecy of Zacharie / that is to say / by this acte of our lorde, nat onely he shewed his meke∣nes:Zacha. 9. B but also the prophecy of Zachary was fulfilled / which sayd: Dicite filie sion, exulta satis filia sion. &c. Say ye to the doughter of Syon / that is, to men dwellynge in Hierusalem / which is the doughter of Syon: Be nat afrayd: but rather be glad & ioyfull.
Here he excludeth all feare of man, and seruyle feare / and gyueth to them a surety of ioye. Beholde (sayeth the Prophet Zacha∣ry) thy kyng (Christe) cummeth to the, mylde and gentyll, syt∣tynge vpon an asse & vpon the colte of the asse. He cummeth nat with great pompe and pryde in chariottes or high horses, nor yet with his armed men or yomen of his garde aboute hym: but in moost mekenes and lowlynes that myght be, to gyue vnto vs all an example / that yf we desyre to folow Christe: we must auoyde all pryde, & shew mekenes also in our outwards actes. Our lorde and sauiour Iesu wolde be honoured before his passion / nat one∣ly to shew how that he was that selfe person of whome the Pro∣phetes dyd speke: but also to declare hym selfe to be very god, whiche myght chaunge and turne the hertes of men, his creatu∣res, at his wyll and pleasure. For though the Iues had a mynde to slee hym, as they dyd shortly after: yet at this tyme he moued theyr hertes to laude and prayse hym. The Iues shewed them selfe moche contrary in this act & in his passion. On Palme son∣daye they cryed and sange:Mat. 21. A. Blessed be he that is cum to vs in the name of god.Ioh. 19. C. On good frydaye they cryed: Tolle tolle crucifige um. Away with hym / hence with hym / crucifie hym. On Palme sonday, they called hym the kyng of Israhell: But on good fry∣day they sayd, We haue no kyng, but the Emperour. On Palme sonday, they cast grene leuys, floures, and theyr garmentes in the way before hym for great honoure: But on good fryday they prepared to hym a great and heuy crosse / and made hym bere it / and afterwarde nayled hym theron. For the floures: they crow∣ned hym with thornes. And at last they toke all his araymēt and clothes from hym. Here was a meruelouse contrarietie in the Iues. ¶Here foloweth a prayer. O Lorde Iesu Christe, whiche freely and with thyne owne wyll cam vnto thy passion: cum also to me a wretche, by thy grace in to my herte and soule. And thou that than dyd re∣pare me by thy deathe on the crosse: repare me agayne that am fallen to synne. Repare me (I saye) by the merytes of that same moost blessyd passion. Graunte to me (lorde) that in all thynges I myght kepe myldenes and mekenes / and to subdue my flesshe & my spyryt hoolly vnto the / & that I may be made as a beest vnto the / yt thou syttyng vpon me, & ruelyng me as thy beest: may lede
me now vnto ye taste of inwarde peace, & desyre of heuenly peace / and at last may brynge me into the vysyon and syght of the same eternall peace, Amen. ¶The .vii particle. Of theiection and castynge out of the byers and sellers in the Temple. AFter that our lorde Iesus was thus gloryously re∣ceiued of the Iues: furthwith he went into the tem∣ple / teachynge vnto vs a forme and maner of good religion, that we all shulde folow / that is, to what so euer towne or place we go: fyrste, whan we be cum thyder: let vs go vnto the chyrch or other place of prayer, if there be any there / and so commendynge our selfe by deuoute prayers vnto our lordes mercy: go and do such busynes as we cam to do. Our lorde entred into the temple, and cast out from thens the by∣ers and sellers / signifienge thereby that the preestes of the Iues, as vnworthy ministers of god: shulde be eiecte and cast out of ye temple.Oelia. 54. super Ioh. And note here as Crisostome sayeth: A man to be paci∣ent in his owne iniuries or wronges done agaynste hym selfe, is moche laudable. But it is a great synne and moche reprouable, to dissemble or leue vncorrecte the offences & iniuries done agaynst god. And therefore Christe suffred paciently his owne iniuries / but the iniuries of his father, he wold in no meanes dyssemble or leue vnpunysshed. Morally for our instruction, The feest of Pasce of the Iues (that is, of them that confesse the name of god, or els mekely confesse theyr synnes) drawynge nygh: oure lorde Iesus ascended vnto Hierusalem / that is, vnto the holy and de∣uoute soule of man, eleuate or lyfte vp by grace. Hierusalem was builded vpon a mount / and therfore it is wryten that Christ dyd ascende vnto Hierusalem.Mat. 20. B The temple in Hierusalem was builded in the hyghest part of the citie / and it signifieth the moost excellente and hyghest parte of the soule / that is,Luce. 19. C the superior or hygher part of reason / whose office is to onely consydre god and eternall thynges. Vnto this temple our lorde doeth ascende by the effecte of his sacramentes / so visitynge it with his spirituall presence. And take good hede that there be foure thynges speci∣ally / whiche our lorde Iesus wyll nat suffre to be in this his tem∣ple / signified by foure thinges that he foūde in the materiall tem∣ple / that is, the money of the chaungers / oxen / shepe, & dowes / the whiche he wolde nat suffe to be in the temple. And also by
these same foure, be signified foure vyces that comonly be foūde nowe in these dayes amonges many religiouse persones. The fyrst is, ouermoche solicitude or busy study in gettynge & kepyng of temporall goodes / and this is noted by the mony that our lord cast abroode in the temple. The onely study or busynes of tempo∣rall goodes is nat forbydden: but ouer moche study, & that it be nat in the temple / that is in the superior part of our reason / which onely ought to intende to god and eternall thynges. Wherefore whan so euer any temporall busynes is exercysed in that temple: it is a greate synne & dysorder. For the creature is put in the place of god / and temporall thynges, in the place of eternall thynges. The seconde is, the inordinate vse of temporall goodes, & thin-circumspecte consideracion, or the wante of a due warenes to a∣uoyde peryls and daūgers. And this is noted by the oxen / for the oxe doeth very gredely fede of the herbys or grasse of the groūde / and therfore sumtyme for his gredynes or hastynes, he deuoureth and swaloweth vp that thynge that is noysum and hurtefull vnto hym / whiche lyrketh and is hyd amonge the herbes. So oftymes it happeneth that whan men wyll vse these temporall goodes in∣ordinately, and vnwysely or gredyly / though he wolde take that is necessary: yet sumtyme he taketh that is noysum to hym. For superfluitie and also corporall pleasure, is oftymes lyrkyng and hyd vnder necessitie. The thyrde vyce or defaute is a dulnes and slouthefulnes to do good and vertuouse werkes / and this is sig∣nified by the dowue / whiche before she taketh hyr flyght: she hath great deliberacion and taryeng / turnyng hyr hed on euery syde & lokyng roude about to cōsydre whether she shal flye / but oftymes in ye meane tyme she is smytten with a byrdbolt / or els taken with the hawke. So it fortunyth oftymes vnto ydle & slouthful or dull persones. The fourthe is, a folysshe and inordinate feare / that is signified by the shepe / which is more folyssh than other bestes. In so moche that yf in the tyme of thunderynge she be lefte alone from the flocke, and be greate with lambe: for folysshe feare she wyll caste vp hyr lambe. So folysshe fearefull men, for feare of hurtyng of the body, or for feare of displeasure of sum persons: wyl caste vppe the fruyte of spyrytuall profyte / that is, leue vn∣done vertuouse and merytoryouse werkes. Where as Christe entreth into the temple: all suche vyces ben expelled / and that on this maner. He maketh a scourge or a whyppe of thre cordes. The fyrste, is corporall syckenes. The seconde, is trouble of mynde. And the thyrde, is spyrytuall admonicion, by the in∣styncte
and mocyon of the hooly gooste. With this whyppe oure lorde doeth caste out all theyse foure vyces from oure sou∣les. And more ouer he tourneth ouer theyre chayres or stooles, and also all theyr bordes or tables wheron they dyd rest / for that they shoulde nat lyghtely or easely cum there in agayne. So our lorde caste oute of the soule all the helpe and mouers vnto synne.Esay. 56. . And oure lorde sayde vnto theym whom he droue oute of the Temple. It is wrytten by the Prophete Esaye: Domus mea, domus orationis vocabitur. &c. My house / that is dedy∣cate vnto my honour and name: shall be called the house of pray∣er / and nat the house of rape or thefte / nor of marchaundyse / vayne speache, or vayne beholdynge. Hereof is gyuen vnto vs a greate confydence or trust that oure prayers shall be herde. Wherefore elles wolde he moue vs to pray in his temple: excopte he wolde there here oure prayers?Hier. 7. B. It foloweth: Vos ecists illam spelumcam latronum.Mat. 21. B But ye haue made my Temple a denne of theuys. The theuys haue none other sorow or care: but onely to gette temporall goodes / and howe so euer they may haue or gette theym: they regarde ne care nat / so that they may haue theym. And therefore they hyde theym selfes in pryuye ca∣ues or dennys, bycause that they wolde nat be taken or percey∣uyd.Mat. 21. B It foloweth: Et accesserunt ad eum ceci et claudi in templum, et sanauit eos. After this acte or dede done: there came vnto oure sauyoure Iesus Christe into the Temple many blynde men and lae men / and incontinently he cured and healed theym. And so they were as wytnesses of the voyce and pray∣synge of the chylderen that with loude voyce cryed in the Tem∣ple, and sayde vnto oure sauyoure Christe Iesu: Hoshiah. That is as moche to saye: Saue vs, or make vs safe nowe. And oure sauyoure Iesus aunswered vnto theym / nat by wor∣des: but by his deedes / in curynge and gyuynge helthe vnto the blynde and the lame men. As yf he shulde say, ye call me a sauy∣our / and desyre helthe of me. Loo, I as a very sauyoure, gyue vnto you helthe. The prynces of the preestes and the scrybes that is, the lerned men in the lawe of god / seynge these great myracles and meruayles / and hearyng the chylderen tryenge / in the Tem∣ple / & praysyng hym as god: they had great indignacion therat / and so were greatly moued against hym with enuy, , and malice. For comonly euyll and enuyouse men can nat pacyently here the prayse of good men. And where as they durst nat lay vy∣olent handes vppon hym for feare of the people that than fauou∣red
hym, nor yet impugne his manifest and open myracles: yet they rebuked hym for yt he suffred the people so to reioice in hym / and the chylderen also to praise and laude hym as god so openly in the tēple.Ibidem. And so they sayd vnto hym: Audis quid isti dicuntur? Doest thou here & perceyue what these people do say? As yf they sayd, thou shulde nat suffre suche laude and prayse to be gyuen to the, whiche is onely due to god / therfore yf thou were an holy, iust, and good man: thou woldest refuse or declyne frome suche glory and prayse. And Iesus aunswered, sayenge: Vti{que}. I here theyr praysynges, and ought to here them / for this praysyng was preordinate of god longe before this tyme to be gyuen vnto me / for so it is wrytten by the Prophete Dauid:Psalmo. 8. Ex ore infantium et lactentium perfecisti laudem. That is, Thou good lorde hast per∣fourmed the praysyng (that thou ordred for thy son) to be fulfyl∣led by the mouth or voice of infantes & yonge suckynge chyldren. ¶A prayer. O Lorde, thou made a generall signe or token of thy terrible iudgement whan thou cast out of the temple all byers and sellers with a whyppe made of thre cordes / shewynge in thy face or iyen the flame of thy diuinitie: I pray and beseche the lorde to graunt me to remembre & so to consydre thy terryble presence, yt I myghte feare the with an holye feare. For thy iudgementes be great and nat to be serched / whiche whan I consydre: all my bo∣nes quake for feare / for there is no man lyuynge vpon the erthe / that is sure of thy glory / but all thynges be reserued as vncerteyn vnto the tyme hereafter to cum / that we shulde euer serue the de∣uoutly & vertuously in feare / & also ioye in the with drede. Amen. ¶The .viii. particle. Of the dolorouse or sorowfull de∣partyng of our sauiour Iesu from his mother Mary. ALthough theuangelystes wryte lytle or no thynge of the heuy departynge of our sauioure Iesus from his mother: yet dyuers holy doctours, moued of the ho∣ly goost, haue shewed the same. And in especiall these sayntes. Austyn, Bernarde, Anselme, and Iohānes de Capistrano. And that in this maner. The wednysdaye, after that Iudas had made promyse to the Iues that he wolde betraye Christe, and delyuer hym into theyr handes: he cam into Betha∣ny, where as Iesus was with his disciples. Christe knew very well that Iudas had solde hym / and that nat withstandynge, he
toke Iudas in his armes & kyssed hym, whan he cam to Betha∣ny / thereby secretely mouynge hym to forsake and leue his mali∣ciouse mynde. Also our lady the vyrgyn Mary, louyngely and frendely bad hym welcom / and asked of hym, what he herde of hyr sonne. And Iudas sayd, euery man speketh good by hym. Ma∣ry moche louyd Iudas, bycause she knewe that he was knowen and in fauour with the prynces of the prestes. But yf she had kno∣wen what he had done: I suppose hyr virginall hert wolde haue broken for sorow. But bycause she knew it nat: they wēt quietly to supper. At the whiche supper Iudas set hym bytwyxte Iesus and his mother Mary, for a token or sygne that shortely by his treason: he wold diuide them a sunder. And at this supper, Christ declared ordinately the misteries of his passion. And in his prea∣chynge, whan he beholdynge Iudas remembred his falsnes and dampnacion:2. 2. questi. 136. quest. 1. Christe waxed very pale. For as saynte Thomas sayeth: Amonges all the passions of the soule: heuynes doeth moost noy and hurte the body, and altre the body. And whan sup∣per was done: the vyrgyn Mary sayd to hyr sonne Iesus: My swete sonne, I wolde speke with the secretely. And than she sayd, O my confort and my lyght / say to me the trouth, why wast thou so pale at supper / & what ment thy wepyng and depe syghynges? My herte was almoost broken thereby. And than Iesus sayd to his mother, O my blessed mother / thou remēbrest for what cause I was incarnate and made man in thy wombe / therfore sith thou woldest knowe the cause of my heuynes: this is it. The tyme is cum and the houre is at hande, that I shall be departed from the by my moost bytter passion that I shall suffre for the redemption of man. Therfore whan I actually remēbre this: it causeth suche heuynes in me. Than whan the vyrgyn Mary herd for a certein∣ty that the deathe of hyr sonne was so nyghe at hande: Ah good lorde, how moche dyd she sorow? What wepynges, sobbynges, and syghynges had she? Euery motherly hert may imagyn. And than after hyr wepynges, she wyllyng to moue hyr sonne to sum other maner & way of redemption for the saluacion of man: said. My dere sonne, I knowe that thy heuenly father hathe decreed with his mercy to redeme mankynde / but all thynges be possible to thy father and to the. Wherfore yf it wolde please thy father & the: thou myght redeme mankynde by an other way, than by thy passion. Sithe therfore thou maist so do: I beseche the it may so be. Hereunto Iesus aunswered, O my moost swete mother, I knowe thy loue and charitie towardes me / but (good mother)
I must nedes more obey to god my father, of whome I haue my godhed: than to the, of whome onely I haue my manhoode. This same wednysday Mary Magdalene sent a messanger vn∣to Hierusalem, to here and knowe what was there spoken of Ie∣su. And this messanger sayde that it was decreed by the councell of the Phariseis, that Iesus shulde dye / and how that they wold crucifie hym. And than the virgyn Mary, with Mary Mag∣dalene and Martha, cam vnto Iesu and sayd, O moost pitiouse confortour, go nat into Hierusalem: for they haue concluded a∣gaynste the / they wyll slee the. Abyde here / we shall prepare the Paschall lambe for the. Hereunto Iesus sayde, O my deare mother, O Magdalene, O Martha, The tyme determyned by my father, is cum, that I shulde redeme mankynde. It is neces∣sary that my fathers wyll be fulfyllyd. Than the virgyn Mary sayd to hym, O my moost dere belouyd sonne, O my lyfe & light of myne iyen / yf thou wylte nedes go into Hierusalem, and dye: suffre me to dye with the, or els before the. Iesus aunswered & sayd, O my moost kynde mother, all my disciples shall forsake me, and the faythe shall perysshe and cease in them for the tyme of my passion / therfore it is necessarye that thou abyde with theym / bothe to confyrme them in faythe, and also to conforte them. O my swete mother, I thanke the with all my herte for all thy bene∣fytes and kyndenes that thou haste done to me. Here frendes, loke vppon hyr motherly herte, and consydre what heuynes and sorow she had, herynge these wordes of hyr dere sonne Iesus. Erly on the thursday in the mornyng, they bothe kneled downe / and kyssynge to gyther: toke theyr leue with many teares & we∣pynges. And as saynt Austen sayeth, Libro de verbis domini: Whan they went to gyther: the virgyn mary sayd: O my moost swete sonne, I shall no more here the. O ioy, full of the pleasure of paradyse. I shal no more touche the. O thou consolacion of the worlde. I wyll neuer leue the. Yf thou go: I wyll go. Yf thou stande: I wyll stande. And than Iesus aunswered with a we∣pynge and mournynge voice. O my dere mother, why doest thou trouble me with thy wepynge: sithe the heuynes that I haue for my passion is sufficient for me? So ofte doeth the swerde of so∣row perce my herte: as ofte as I se the wepe, or any teare fall frō thyne iyen. Wherefore I beseche the moost naturall and louynge mother to go with my welbelouyd Magdalene into hyr house / to whō I commende the / and so with great sorow departed. And at this moost heuy departynge, she sayd vnto Iudas, O Iudas, I
commende my moost dere beloued son vnto the. Yf thou here any thynge contrary to hym: shew hym of it, that he may be the more ware. And herof sayeth saynt Bernarde, O blyssed vyrgyn Ma∣ry, thou dyd nat know that thou commended thy moost innocent sonne to a foxe moost false and subtile. Thy moost mekest lambe, to a wolfe. Thy sonne, very truthe: to a crafty lyer. And so the sorowfull mother departed from hyr sonne / seynge that it wolde be non otherwyse. O, what (suppose you) sayd than Magda∣lene, Martha, and other women there presente, vnto our lady? Let euery man thynke as his deuocion seruyth hym. I thynke they myght say,Cāti. 5. D. as it is wryten in the Canticles, O moost good∣ly of all women / whyther is thy moost dere beloued gone? Where hathe he hyd hym selfe? We wyll go serche hym with the. And the sorowfull vyrgyn myghte aunswere, My conforte, my lyfe, my sonne doeth go in a strayt and harde way / byset rounde about with his enemies. &c. ¶The .ix. particle. Of the supper or maundie of our lorde. WHan the tyme of the miseracions and mercies of our lorde was cum, in the whiche he had disposed to saue his people: & to redeme theym / nat with corruptyble golde or syluer: but with his owne preciouse blood, before he shoulde departe frome his disciples by his corporall dethe: he wolde make vnto them a supper, for a signe & memoriall of thynges past, and also to fulfyll the misteries that were to be fulfylled. Therefore our lorde Iesus, required of his disciples, where and in what place he wolde haue the Paschall lambe prepared for hym and them:uce. 2. A. He sente Peter and Iohn̄ to one of his louers in the mounte of Syon, where as was a good∣ly and a great chambre strewed and made redy for hym / and there they prepared the Paschall lambe for hym. By Peter is signifi∣ed good operacion or actyue lyfe. And by Iohn̄ is noted deuoute contemplacion. These .ii. prepare the Pascall lambe / that is, they dispose a man duely and reuerētly to receyue the holy body of our lorde, signified by the Paschall lambe. They prepare this spi∣rituall lambe in a greate lofte or chamber / that is, in the soule of man, eleuate and lyfte vp by feruent deuocion / and great by lon∣ganimitie / broode, by the brede of charitie / and strawed by the di∣uersitie of vertues. And whan all thynges were prepared in this chambre: Iesus dyd entre with his disciples / to whom the Pas∣call
lambe rosted, was brought furthe. And grace sayde, or blys∣syng made by our lorde: they eat it with the iuse of wylde letue. And note that in this solēpnitie of Pasce, there were toure thyn∣ges / that is, the Pascall lambe, pure wheat brede without leuyn / wyne, and the iuse of wylde letuse / to signifie that no man might cum worthely to eat of the true lambe, the body of Christe: with∣out bytternes and compunction of herte for theyr synnes. This refection also doeth signifie theternall refection of glory that shal be in the ende of the worlde. Than Iesus rysynge from supper / his disciples syttynge and eatynge: he sayd, I haue with a great desyre desyred to eat this Pascall lambe with you before my pas∣sion. This worde desyre, twyse spoken: doeth signifie a mynde of two desyres. One was, yt the olde testament shuld be finished: and the new shuld be begun. And this was moost his desyre. For all the dayes of his lyfe he ranne after vs with a moost feruent de∣syre of our helthe. And we▪ yf we can nat at sumtyme haue good myndes and desires: at the leest let vs haue a wyl to haue yt good desyre,Psal. 118. D accordynge to the sayenge of Dauid: Concupiuit anima mea deside rare iustificationes tuas. My soule hath couetyd or de∣syred to desyre thy iustificacions. After this, Christe toke bread and wyne / and gyuynge thankes to god: blyssed them / and so con¦uerted the bread into his owne body / & the wyne into his bloode / and gaue it vnto them / sayenge, take and eat / this is my bodye / & drynke of my bloode. And here he shewed his great desyre yt was to cum / that is, to shede his bloode for our redemption / that after the immolacion & offeryng of the figuratiue and Pascall lambe: shulde folow the oblacion of the very true lambe Iesus Christe. And so the olde figures ceassed / and all thynges were made new: whan that Christ conuertyd and turned bread and wyne into his precyouse body and bloode.Exod. 12. B And here note that in the boke cal∣led Exodus, there were determined many thynges that were re∣quyred to the eatynge of the figuratiue & Pascall lambe / whiche also spiritually be requyred to theatynge of the verye true lambe our sauiour Iesus. Fyrst it shulde be eaten onely of them that be circumcidyd: so shulde we be circumcidyd by the cuttynge away of our olde synfull conuersacion and lyfe. Secondely, it shulde be eaten with the iuse of wylde letuse / signifienge that we shulde haue bytter contricion for our synnes. Thyrdly, with pure whete breade without leuyn, betokenynge the puritie of our conscience without leuyn of fynne. Fourthly, theyr clothes shulde be gyr∣ded vp: signifienge oure chastitie of body & soule. Fyftely, they
shulde haue shoes vppon theyr fete / betokenynge that our affecti∣ons shulde be separate from all erthely thynges. In a signe also or token herof, our lord fyrst wasshed the fete of his disciples, be∣fore that he gaue to them his body and blood. Sixtely, they shuld haue staues in theyr handes / notynge therby that we shulde dili∣gently kepe our selfe. These syxe foresayd condicions ben re∣quyred in vs, as concernynge the auoidaunce of vyce and synne. And in lyke maner, syxe thynges ben requyred in vs yf we wyll worthely receyue the sacrament of the aulter, as concernynge the operacion of good werkes and gettynge of vertues. Fyrst, that it be eaten in one house / that is, in the vnitie of the chyrche / that we be nat diuided from the chyrche by any scisme or heresye. Secondly, that we take or eat it with our neighbours, as many as shall be sufficient to eate it / signifienge the loue and concorde with our neighbours. Thyrdely, that it be nat eaten raw / that is, withoute the fyre of loue / ne yet sodden with water of car∣nall pleasures; but rosted with the fyre of feruent deuocion. Fourthly, it shulde be eaten hastely: betokenyng our feruent de∣syre and delectacion folowynge. Fyftely, it shulde be eaten all hole / bothe hed, fete, and the inwarde partes / signifieng that we shulde be incorporate vnto Christe with a hole and true fayth / be∣leuynge the diuinitie of Christe: whiche is the hed / also his hu∣manitie, body, & flesshe / whiche is as the fote / and also his soule, whiche is as the inwarde parte. Syxtely, they shulde breke no bone of the Paschall lambe / signifienge the symple veneracion & worshyppynge of this sacrament / nat dyuydyng the godhed from the manhode / nor the flesshe from the blood / for vnder euery parte of the hooste consecrate, there is hole Christe, bothe god & man / soule, body, and blood. Wherfore who so euer receiueth the sacra∣mēt of the aulter vnder the forme of bread only: he receyueth hole Christe god and man / soule, flesshe, and blood. ¶A prayer. O Lorde Iesu Christe, whiche in the euyn tyde made thy last supper with thy disciples in a greate and large chaumbre strawed and made redye for the / and there fedde theym with thy moost sacrate body and bloode: make my herte (I beseche the) a great & large chambre prepared for the. Enlarge in it trew fayth, hope, and charitie. Magnifie or make it great, with longanimi∣tie, pacience, & mekenes / and straw it with all maner of vertues.
Graunt me lorde that my herte contrite and thus prepared: may take and receyue the after my pore maner / whom heuyn and erthe are nat able to take and conteyne: that by thy grace inhabytance in me, I may thynke and performe in dede all thynges pleasyng to the / and declyne or auoyde all vyce and synne by perfyte hace of them / and so continuynge vnto the ende: I may worthely re∣ceiue thy preciouse body and blood in the sacrament of the aulter. AMEN. ¶The .x. and last particle of this fyrst parte. Of the wasshynge of his disciples fete. WHan this supper was done, and the Paschall lambe eaten, and whan the deuyll had put into the herte & wyll of Iudas to betraye Christe, nat dyrecy mo∣uynge his wyll, as the soule moueth the bodye: but onely indyrectly by suggestion mouynge and per∣swadynge hym to betray Christe / and he consented thereunto. And here note that the deuyll can nat put euyll thoughtes into ye hert of man: but onely offre them vnto man / which yf the man receyue theym / and that appere to the deuyll by sum outewarde sygne or token: than the deuyll bloweth at this coole to kyne and make the fyre burne / that is, he ceasseth nat to perswade and moue that man to consent vnto that synne. And so it apperech that the deuyll can nat cast a man downe and ouercum hym: ex∣cept the man cast hym selfe fyrste downe, and rendre his armour vnto his enemy / that is, excepte he consent to the suggestyon and mocion of the deuyll.Ioh. 13. A. This supper (I saye) done, and the Paschall lambe eaten / whan the deuyll had moued Iudas to be∣traye Christe, and he consented to the same: than Iesus know∣ynge as god, that his father had gyuen and taken into his han∣des and power all thynges / also his enemy and traytour Iudas, and the Iues his persuers: yet to shew and declare his great py∣tie / & to leue to vs an example of his perfyte mekenes: he wolde nat fulfyll or take vppon hym the power or myghte of god, or offyce of a lorde, but rather the offyce and roume of a seruaunte. He dyd meke hym selfe to be a seruaunt / for he cam to do seruice: and nat to receyue the seruyce of other. And therefore he arose frome his supper of the Paschall lambe, wyllynge than to wasshe the fete of his dyscyples there beynge / and so causyng water to be brought vnto hym: he put of his outwarde garmentes / & gyrdyd
hym selfe with a lynen clothe. Than he put the water into a basen with his owne handes / and so charitably, so honestly, and so ser∣uiceably prepared: he cam to wasshe his disciples fete that were defoiled with the claye and durte of the erthe / for they wente bare foed. And so he wasshed theyr fete, & wyped them with the clothe wherwith he was gyrte: and thus he fulfylled the office of meke∣nes. And whan he came to Petre / he wolde nat suffre hym to wasshe his fete, but sayd / thou hale neuer wasshe my fete. And Iesus sayde, Yf I wasshe nat thy fete: thou shalte haue no parte of my blysse with me. Than Petre, fearynge this sentence: sayd▪ Wasshe (good lorde) nat onely my fete: but also my handes and my hed. And Iesus sayd: He that is wasshed, he nedeth no more to wasshe but his fete / for than he is all clene. What this signi∣fieth: ye shall know afterwarde.Ioh. 13. B. It foloweth in the gospell of Iohn: Ye be now clene, for I haue wasshed you / but ye all be nat clene. This he spake for Iudas, that shuld betray hym that same nyghte / and therefore he was nat clene. There be two thynges specially, whereby a man is made clene from synne / that is, al∣mose dede, and charitie. Iudas had nat the fyrst: for he was a thefe, and toke vnto his owne vse suche thynges as shulde haue be gyuen to the pore. Also he betrayed his innocent maister, con∣trarye vnto charitie / and so Iudas was nat clene. O thou chrystyan / consyder here dylygentely euery poynte of this was∣shynge: for they be full of mekenes and loue. Beholde what is done: for it is very deuoute. Here the hyghe maiestie of god, and mekenes of the maister, dyd enclyne & bow hym selfe downe to the fete of pore fysshers. He knelyd on his knees, and bowed his hede before his disciples syttynge / and so wasshed theyr fete with his owne handes / dyd also drye them and kysse them all. Beholde here the exemplar of all myldenes and mekenes, the cre∣atoure and maker of all creatures, the fearefull iudge of bothe quycke and deade: knelynge here before the fete, nat onely of his louynge disciples: but also before the fete of the false traytoure Iudas. O thou man / lerne here of thy lorde / for he is bothe meke in herte, and gentyll in his conuersacion. Be thou confounded of thy hyghe mynde. Arte thou nat asshamed of thy pryde and impacience? He that is syttynge aboue the high order of aūgels, called Cherubyn, wassheth the fete of his enemy & traytour: and thou erthe & dust, asshes & cley, exaltest thy selfe, & thynkest great thynges of thy selfe. Consider diligently how our lorde inciteth & moueth vs by his examples & also by his wordes vnto mekenes.
Therfore, after that he wasshed his disciples fete, shewyng there to vs an example of great mekenes:Ioh. 13. B. he sayd to vs: Exempum de∣di vobis vt quemadmodum ego feci vobis: ita et vos faciatis. I haue gyuen to you an example, that as I haue done to you: so ye shulde do.Mat. 11. D. And also he sayde in an other place: Discite a me, quia mitis sum et humilis corde. Lerne of me / for I am mylde in conuersacion and meke in herte. And in this, he kept a conue∣nient maner of teachynge. For as saynt Luke sayeth: Cepit le∣sus facere et docere. Iesus began fyrste to lyue and do well / and after that,Act. 1. A. he dyd teache other to do the same. Spiritually, by this outwarde wasshynge of the fete, oure lorde dyd note the in∣warde clennes of our spirituall fete, which be our loue and aec∣tions. For these spirituall fete do bere vs where so euer we go frō our selfe / or without vs. And as our bodyly fete hath ofte tymes nede of wasshynge: so oure spirituall fete. For thoughe we be hoolly & clene wasshed by the sacrament of Baptym, in so moche that yf we kepe that innocency and clennes that we by that sacra∣ment receyue, vnto our dethe: we be sure to go to heuyn without any other wasshyng: Yet, for asmoche as there is very few or non that kepe that puritie of theyr baptysme after that they cum to the yeres of discrecion, but yt oftymes they fall in one thyng or other & that thrughe the fraile condicion of our mortall nature, so that they defoile theyr fete with worldly, vayne, or carnall affectiōs: therfore it is necessary yt they oft wassh theyr fete with cōfession & teres of cōtricion. For who so euer after his baptym do fall to syn, & be nat wasshed with ye water of penaūce: he shall haue no parte with Iesu in his glory. By this wasshyng of ye fete, our lord al∣so doeth note the clennes of our spirituall fete / whiche specially is required in the receiuing of the blessed body of our lord. And ther∣fore he dyd wasshe the fete of his disciples before he gaue to them his gloriouse body & blood: to signifie yt spirituall clennes is re∣quyred in the due receyuynge of the sacrament of the aulter. ¶A prayer. O Mylde Iesu, and the exemplar of very mekenes / whiche wasshed the fete of thy disciples / I aske and also beseche the lorde, purge & clense thou myne affections / that I so purified in bothe fete, & kyndled with a double charitie / that is, with the loue of god and of my neighboure, I might surely cum to the my puryfyer and clenser. Kepe me clene good lorde vnto the ende of my dayes / and clense me frome all spottes of synnes, that all my negligencys and also synnes forgotten: myne enemyes, con∣founded
and rebuked, might go fro me at the houre of my dethe / whiche specially wyll lye in awayte of me at that houre. Directe and order my fete lorde in to the waye of peace / that I delyuered from the handes and power of all myne enemies: myght blesse & prayse the with all they electe seruantes world without ende. AMEN. ¶Here endeth the Proheme or fyrste part of this treatyse. And here begynneth the seconde parte, called the execucion. THexecucion of this glasse, shalbe asentenciouse declaracion of our lordes passion, approbate & taken of many holy doctours. As of saynte Hie∣rom, sayntes Augustine, Bernarde, Simon de Cassia, Reynarde de Laudenburg / and for the more part, taken of Ludolphe carthusience. And we shall folowe the processe of the gospell / begynnyng this declaracion of the passion, where as saynt Iohn theuāgelist begynneth the passion of Christ / that is, in the .xviii. chapitre of his euangely. And we shall diuide this part into .lxv. articles. And euery article shall shew sum notable poynt or payn that Christ suffred. And to euery article shal we adde a document or lesson with a prayer / which prayers may serue vnto vs for two purposes or causes. Fyrst, it is as a summary and breue or short recollection or declarynge of all that was wryten in tharticle and also document goynge before. Secondly, to kyndle the deuoci∣on of the reders / whiche deuocion, that it may be more encreased: all thoo thynges that Christe dyd than suffre, shulde be so moche imprynted in our herte, and so pleasaunt to vs: as yf he had only suffred them for vs, and our onely saluacion. And for this cause also, all the prayers be fourmed and made in the singular nom∣bre / to the intent that we may applye them to our selfe. As it shall appere hereafter in the same prayers.
¶The fyrst artycle. Of the feare and heuynes of Christe. THe fyrste artycle of our lordes passion, is the voluntary takynge of feare and heuynes. For as the euangelyst sayeth: Hymno dicto: exie∣runt in montem Oliueti.Mat. 26. C. For shortly after that the supper was ended, and the deuout sermon the whiche he spake, was done: than he sayd grace / and so they wente vnto the mounte of Oliuete. This sermon is wrytten by the Euangelyst Iohn̄. And immediately after that sermon: it folo∣weth in the begynnynge of the .xviii. Chapytre. Hec cum dixisset Iesus: Egressus est cum discipulis suis trans torrentem Cedron. Whan Iesus had spoken that longe and deuout sermon:Capitul. 13. D. 14. 15. 16. et. 17. he went from that house where as he made his supper / nat taryenge or a∣bydynge there for Iudas, whiche was gone to get a great com∣pany of the Iues, for to take his maister Christe. Our lorde (I say) wolde nat abyde the cummyng of Iudas in his hoste house / lesse paraduenture his hoste, or sum of his familie or seruauntes shulde haue ben euyll entreated by the cruell Iues or theyr mini∣sters and seruauntes / and therefore he wente thence ouer the ry∣uer of Cedron. To signifie also to vs, that no man may attayne and cum to the pleasures and ioye of heuenly paradise: except he, fyrste passe ouer the ryuer and water of penaunce. And so, he passyng ouer that ryuer of Cedron: cam vnto a lytle vyllage that was at the fore of the moūt of Oliuet, called Gethsemany / where as was a garden or orcharde / into the whiche he entred with his disciples. Gethsemani is as moche to say by interpretacion as Villa pinguedinis. The towne of fatnes / signifienge thereby that by the mekenes of his passion, he wold replenyssh vs with the fat∣nes of grace and vnction of the holy goost. And that he went into the gardeyn: doeth signifie that he wolde by his passyon induce vs and brynge vs into the orcharde of vertues and spirituall ry∣chesse. And also that the maner of our curacion and redempti∣on shulde corresponde and reaunswere vnto the maner of oure fyrste transgression and perdition, whiche toke begynnynge of the synne of oure fyrste father Adam in the orcharde of Para∣dyse: so in lyke maner our reparacion that shulde be made by the passion of Christe, shulde haue his begynnynge also in the or∣charde.
And whan they were in this orcharde or garden: our lorde sayd to his disciples:Mat. 26. . Sedete hic donec vadam illuc et orem, orate{que} ne intretis in temptationem.Luce. 2.  Sy here vnto the tyme I go and praye / and praye you that ye be nat ouercum by temptaci∣on. It foloweth: Et assumpsit secum Petrum, Iacobum, et Iohan∣nem. And he toke with hym Peter,Libro. . Iames, and Iohn̄. And here noteth Simon de Cassia / that a persone, put in greate agonyes or troubles, hathe neede to haue a certeyne trynytye of vertues / withoute the whiche trynytye, he fyghteth in vayne / his prayer is frustrate / and his contemplacion of lytle profyte. Fyrste, he must haue a knowlege of those thynges that he ought to do / that is, the lyghte of true faythe / whereby he knoweth all thynges necessarye for his saluacion. The seconde, is a debellacyon and trewe supplantynge or subduynge of vyces. The thyrde, is the assystante grace of the hooly gooste▪ This trynytie of vertues is noted by these thre appostles, Pe∣tre, Iames, and Iohn̄. And that appereth by the interpretaci∣on of theyr names. For Petre is as moche to saye (by interpre∣tacion) as knowynge / and so signifieth the stable knowledge of the faythe. Iames is interpreted a supplantoure or a subduer. And by Iohn̄ is sygnyfyed the grace of god. And withoute this trinitie of vertues, all oure laboure is in a maner but loste.Mat. 26. D It foloweth in the gospell: Cepit Iesus contristar et mest esse. Iesus began to be heuye and sadde. Marke sayeth:Marc. 14. D. Cepit pauere et tedere. He began to feare and to be yrke∣som or heuye. And here is the fyrste poynte or artycle of the passion of our lorde / that is, feare and heuynes / whiche he volun∣taryly toke for vs / and that in the mooste intense and hyghest de∣gree / and this is to be vnderstonde in lyke maner of all other ar∣tycles. And note here the wordes of the Euangelystes / whiche sayeth: Cepit Iesus contrista, &c. Iesus began to be heuye. They say nat that he was heuye / for than that passion of feare or heuynesse, shulde haue had dominion in his soule. Whiche was nat trewe / for he tooke that feare or heuynesse of his owne voluntarye wyll / and that for many causes. As for the ruyne or fall of his dyscyples. For the blyndenes, enuye, and perdy∣cyon of the Iues. For the desperacyon and dampnacion of Iu∣das. For the distruction of the citie and temple of Ierusalem. And also for the bytternes of his greuouse paines / and of the most shamefull dethe / that by the vertue of his godhed, he knewe be∣fore, that he shulde suffre it afterwarde. And therefore he sayde:
Tristis est anima mea vs{que} ad mortem.Mat. 26. D My soule is heuye vnto the dethe / that is. My heuynes is so intense and so greate, that yf it were any more: dethe shuld folow. Or els, My heuines is such, that it shall nat cease or leue me vnto the dethe. And note how he sayeth, vnto the dethe / and nat thus, My soule is heuye for my dethe. For he toke this sorowe and heuynes wylfully for thobedi∣ence of his father,Libro. 13. and saluacion of mankynde. And here Si∣mon de Cassia noteth a good lesson / that it is moche profitable to preuent heuynes by heuynes / that is, eternall payn and heuines, by temporall heuynes. This heuynes in Christe dyd excede all the sorowes and heuynesses of all the men of this worlde / for he suffred for all the synnes of all mankynde.Psalm. 21. And therfore he sayeth by the prophete: My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me? This is the cause. The wordes of my synnes hathe put me tarre from my helthe and conforte.De Geues ad litterā .li. 4. ca. 9. Heuynes is than (for a truthe) a laudable & commendable passion (as saynt Austyn sayeth) whan it procedeth of a ryght loue or good cause. As whan a man is he∣uy for his owne synnes, or for the synnes of other persones. Also heuynes is taken profitably,2. Cor. 7. C whan it is taken for the satis∣faction of our synnes. And therefore saynt Paule sayeth: Que se∣cundum deum est tristitia: penitētiam in salutem stabilem operatur. That heuynes whiche is accordynge to the wyll of god: doeth worke penaunce into our stable and sure helthe. And therefore Christe, to do satisfaction for the synnes of all men: toke vppon hym the moost heuynes that might be / and yet it excedyd nat the order and rule of ryght reason. Also he suffered payne in his bo∣dy for the synnes of all mankynde. Whiche payne and sorow exce∣dyd the sorowes of euery person contrite. And no maruell that his sorow was so greate / for it procedyd of a more depe or inwarde knowledge and wysdom / and also of a more perfyte charitie and loue, than the sorowe of any otherman. And these be the causes whereby the sorow of contricion is encreased. Also he suffered & sorowed for all our synnes / as the prophete sayeth: Vere dolores nostros ipse portauit.Esay. 53. B Truely he bare oure sorowes, and suffered for vs. Also Christe toke all the causes of our heuines / and ther∣fore his heuynes and sorow was the moost. It foloweth in the texte:Mat. 26. D Vigilate et orate ne intretis in temptationem. He sayd vnto his thre disciples whom he founde slepynge, watche and praye: that ye be nat ouercum by temptacion. He watcheth, that doeth good werkes, and that kepeth hym selfe diligently that he fall nat into any heresy or derke and erroniouse opinion. Spirius quidē
promptus est, caro autem infirma. The spyryte is prompte and re∣dy to do well and to promise great thynges / but the flesshe is in∣fyrme & fraile to do good, or to suffre payne. And Christe spake this for the proude folysshe persons whiche thynke that they may do what so euer they wyll.Su{per} Ma. 26. And hereunto saynte Hierom sayeth: As moche as we trust of the feruour and redynes of our mynde & spyryte: so moche we shulde feare of the infirmitie and frailtie of our flesshe.Luce. 22.  It foloweth: Et positis genibus orabat dicens: Pater si vis: transfer calicem istum a me. Iesus knelynge, prayed to his father / sayenge: Father, yf thou wylte: thou may take this payn and passion from me. Our lorde here prayed after his sensuall wyll, to that that the reason of Christ dyd here expresse the affect and desyre of his sensualitie as the aduocate of sensualitie for this tyme. And therefore whan he added in his prayer: Verumtamen non mea voluntas, sed tua fiat. This nat withstandyng, thy wyll be fulfylled / and nat myne: He dyd expresse that this affection in hym was subdued to ryght reason / that is, to his reasonable and godly wyll / by the whiche he wolde the same thynge that god his father wolde / from whom by this wyll, he was nat diuided. It foloweth:Luce. 22.  Et cum surrexisset ab oratione et venisset ad discipu∣los suos: inuenit eos dormientes. And whan he rose from his pray∣er and cam to his disciples: he founde them slepynge. This cor∣porall slepe was a fygure & sygne of the slepe of infidelitie / wher∣with they shulde be shortely greued and oppressed. Peraduen∣ture sum person may maruell how that they myght slepe, heryng of the dethe of theyr maister Christe? We may answere thus. They were very heuy for his dethe / and heuines wyll induce and moue a man to slepe. Also it was than well forwarde in ye night. And thoughe they all dyd slepe: yet he blamed Petre rather than the other. Fyrst, for bycause he boosted and sayde, Though all other forsake the: I wyl neuer forsake the. Therfore he was wor¦thy more to be rebuked. Also bycause he was the capitayne and chefe of thapostles / and therfore Christ rebuked hym for them all / saynge to Peter thus:Mat. 26. D Sic? non potuisti vna hora vigilare mecum? What Petre? mayst thou nat watche one houre with me? As yf he had sayd, How wylt thou dye with me, that canst nat watche one houre with me? And in that that he sayeth, one hour: he sig∣nifieth to vs, that the burden and tyme of temptacion, is very shorte in the respecte of the remuneracion or rewarde in glory. And note, how that Christe dyd pray thre tymes one and the same prayer / and after euery tyme he cam to his disciples, and founde
them slepynge. He dyd thryse pray the same prayer: to signifie to vs (as saynt Bernarde sayeth) that we shulde dyrect all our pray∣ers to the father, to the sonne, & to the holy goost, that we might haue spirituall strength of the father, wysdom of the sonne, and a good wyll, of the holy goost. Or therefore he prayed thryse, that we shuld excercise the thre powers of our soule in prayer / that is, that our reasonable power shulde be diligent in meditacion / our affection and concupiscible power, shulde be feruent in desy∣rynge / and our wrathfull power shulde be stronge in auoydynge all euyll. Christe also, after euery tyme of his prayer, cam to his disciples, and founde them slepynge. At the fyrst tyme, he rebu∣ked them, as we sayd before. At the seconde tyme, he suffred thē. And at the thyrde tyme, he commaunded them to slepe / sayenge: Dormite iam, et requiescite. Slepe now, & rest. And this was to signifie thre maner of slepys. And that the fyrste, whiche is the slepe of synne, correspondynge to the fyrst slepe of the disciples: is to be reproued. The seconde, that is naturall slepe: is tol∣lerable, and to be suffered. And the thyrde, whiche is the slepe of contemplacion and glory: is to be desyred of all people. ¶Here foloweth a lesson or instruction. OF this artycle we may take this lesson / that whan we wolde pray deuoutly: that we shuld go to sum secret place from the noise or cumpany of men. Al∣so that we commyt all our tribulacions, heuynes, paynes, and infirmities vnto the wyll of god, as Christe dyd after his prayer / thoughe it so be yt we praye and desyre to be delyuered from theym, as Christe dyd: yet let vs submyt our wyll to the wyll of god. Also let vs put all our tribulacions and paynes, as it were into the herte of Christe: de∣syrynge and prayenge hym that he wolde performe and make our pacience perfite in the vnion of his passion / and so offer them to ye laude and glorye of his father. For hereby oure tribulacions and paynes shall be greately dignified. For as the passion of Christe brought great fruite and conforte bothe in heuyn and in erthe: so our paynes and tribulacions, what so euer they be, yf they be in the foresayde maner commytted and commendyd in the vnion of Christes passion: they shall be so frutyfull, that they shall bryng ioye, to the aungels in heuyn / meryte, to the good persones ly∣uynge in erthe / forgyuenes, to the synners / and great refresshyng
and conforte, to the soules in purgatorye. And this is bycause Christe reputeth and accompteth all thynges done to any of his seruauntes, whether it be good or euyll: as done to hym selfe. And therefore he sayeth in the gospell:Mat. 25. D Quod vni ex minimis meis fecistis: mihi fecistis. What so euer ye haue done to one of the leest of myne: ye haue done it to me. And in an other place he sayd to his disciples:Mat. 10. D & Luc. 10. C Qui vos recipit: me recipit, et qui vos spernit: me spernit. He that receiueth you: receiueth me / and he that dispiseth you: dispiseth me. And so our sauiour Christ taketh all our pai∣nes and tribulacions committed to hym (as I sayd before) as his owne / and orech them to his father as his owne with lyke effect and fruite, as is sayd before. Therefore euery good and fayth∣full person ought moche to ioye in his tribulacions and paynes. For what so euer he suffre: Christe doeth confesse that he suffreth the same in hym and with hym. ¶A prayer. O Lorde Iesus Christe, sonne of the lyuynge god, whiche at mydnyght thy passion drawynge nygh, wolde take vpon the, feare & heuynes for me moost wretchyd synner: graunt me continually & fayth∣fully to referre all my tribubulacions, heuynes, & paines vnto the, the god of my hert / & yt thou wolde vouchesafe to bere them with me in the vnion of thy passion and heuynes. That so by the merites of thy moost holy passion, they myght be made to me fruitfull and profitable. Amen. ¶Of the blody swet of Christe. The seconde article. THe seconde artycle is the flowynge of the bloode of Christe into the erthe by the maner of swet, or of the blody swet of Christe, flowynge from his bodye into the erthe. For the seconde tyme that Christ prayed: for anguysshe he swet blood / and the aungell, descendynge from he∣uyn: aered to hym and conforted hym. It foloweth therfore in th gospell:Luc. 22.  Factus in agonia prolixius orabat et factus est sudor eius sicut gutte sanguinis decurrentis in terram. Christe was in a great agony / and therfore he prolonged his prayer. And in this prayer for his great agony: his swet was as droppes of bloode runnynge downe from his body into the erthe. Here do our doc∣tours
say, that whan our lorde Iesus Christe dyd so prolong his prayer: his most holy hert was greatly enflamed / & so cōsequent∣ly all his hole body most holy & most innocent. In so moche, that thrughe that greate feruour of prayer, and his excessyue loue and moost feruent desyre that he had to suffre and to dye for our helth. And of the other parte, thrugh the vehement angwyssh and ago∣ny that he had in his manhode in the remembraunce of his moost greuouse paynes and shamefull dethe that he shulde suffre / and thrugh the stronge reluctacion and stryuynge of sensualitie, na∣turally abhorrynge that dethe, and therfore myghtely fyghtynge agaynst it: for these causes (I say) the poorys of his body were open, and so flowed out the blood for his swet. That vehement angwysshe and excessyue loue constreyned the bloode to cum out of the vaynes agaynst nature (as Bede sayeth) in so moche that many droppes of blood ranne downe by his clothes and fell vpon the erthe.Su{per} Lucā li. 6. ca. 89. The loue of god in the herte of Christe, dyd ouercum in that agony his natural feare and the feare of his manhode / and so the bloode of Christe so quyckened and conforted by this loue: was styrred and moued, as yf it wolde haue cum all furthe of the body at that tyme, thrugh that excessyue loue / as yf he wolde nat or might nat haue abyden the tyme of his dethe appointed whan all that blood shulde be vtterly sheddyd. And so (I say) thrughe this vehement loue: the droppes of blood dyd issue and fall from the vaynes of his body. And as the inwarde cause of swet (after naturall phisiciens) is the naturall hete, dissoluynge that is hote and moyst in the bodye: so the supernaturall cause of this bloody swet myght be the feruent hete and burnynge of his excessyue loue redowndyng from the herte of Christe into al his hole body there dissoluynge the vaporouse moisture. Phisiciens also say, that it is possible that a man may swet naturally thrugh the vehemēce of loue. In lyke maner, as our doctours say, Christe swet blood aboue nature thrugh his vehement feruour of charitie / for thā the more he approched to his dethe: the more he burned in loue for the feruente desyre of our helthe. O, how bytter and paynefull was this dethe of Christe in it selfe: sythe the onely imaginacion therof dyd so greatly chaunge thorder of nature: for it drew from all the partes of his bodye, droppes of bloode: as yf he had swet / whiche blody swet shulde signifie and note to vs the helthe of his misticall body / that is, the catholicall chyrch. Hereto sayth saint Bernarde: By the erthe moisted with the bloody swet of Christ: is signified that erthely men shulde be redemyd by the bloode of
Christe. By the whiche blood also he shulde reduce vnto lyfe, all the worlde ded in synne. Woo be to that wretchyd hert, that wyll nat be moisted and made softe with this blood or swet. Beholde thou wretche the great tribulacion of this most mylde, gentyll, & louynge herte, in what angwyssh it was: whan all his bodye on euery parte swet blood. O thou my stony herte, quake and trem∣ble, and breke in pecys, and moyst thyne iyen with blody teres / for as thou mayst se, thy creatour and maker is all wet in bloode for the / and that with suche plenty: that it ranne downe vpon the erthe. And surely, his body outwardly wolde neuer haue bene so wet with bloode: yf his herte inwardly had nat ben broken with sorowe and heuynesse. Therefore the prophete sayeth in the persone of Christe:Psal. 37. It Hier. 23. B. Contritum est cor meum in meipso. My herte is broken within me. The herte of our mooste louynge Iesus thus inwardly broken or cut: the outwarde skynne also was bro∣ken / so that his blood myght abundantly flow out vpon the erthe. And this bloody swette was very naturall and true bloode of the moost purest body of Christe. But as we sayd before, it was nat shed naturally / for it is agaynst nature, to swet blood. (∵) (∴) ¶Doctrines or holsom lessons. IN this artycle we may take thre holsum and profy∣table lessons. Fyrste, by the apparicion of the aun∣gell. &c. We be enfourmed that the holy aungelles of god do assyst vs and also conforte vs in our pray∣ers.Psalm. 67. Hereunto sayeth the prophete Dauyd: Pre∣uenerunt principes coniuncti psallentibus. The prynces or holy aungelles do preuent them that prayse god or praye to hym with theyr helpe, and also be ioyned vnto them in theyr praysynges. And in an other place he sayeth:Psal. 137. In conspectu angelorum psallam tibi. I shall synge to the, or prayse the lorde, in the syghte or cum∣paignie of aungelles. The seconde lesson. In that that oure lorde in his age went vnto prayer, & also continued longer tyme in the same: we be instructe in all oure trouble or necessytye: to runne vnto prayer. And the more that oure necessytye is: the more to continue our prayer. The thyrde doctrine, is taken of this pryncypall article / & is this / that in our prayer we shuld be so
feruent and intent thereunto, that thrugh the vehemence of our intencion and feruour of our deuocion: we shuld swet as it were bloode, by conformynge our selfe to the passion of Christe, & by the feruour of our loue vnto god.Glosa ordi∣naia. Hereunto sayeth the glose, Ad Romanos. 8. That that charitie whiche is in vs by the grace of the holy goost: that same doeth mourne / that same charitie doeth pray for vs. And agaynst this charitie, he that gaue it: can nat shyt his eares. Moreouer that charitie doeth mourne and pray, vnto it droppe blood. And that is, whan deuocion is so feruently kyndeled in the herte: that for the loue of god (yf nede requyred) he wolde nat be afrayd to shed his blood. And therefore pray ye deuoutly and hertely in the maner folowyng / or in any other lyke maner after your deuocion. ¶A prayer. O Lorde Iesu Christe, sonne of the lyuynge god, whiche in thy long prayer wolde be conforted of the aungell / and in thy agony swet meruelously droppes of blood: graūt to me by the vertue of thy prayer, that thy hooly aungell myghte euer assyst me in my prayer, and conforte me / that I restynge in the swete remembraunce of thy moost bytter passion: myght de∣uoutly swet the droppes of teares for thy bloode in thy syghte and knowledge. Amen. ¶Of the vendition or sellynge of our lorde. The thyrde article. ❧ THe thyrde article is the sellynge of our lorde. Whiche sellynge, though it began and was promysed before the other two articles that we haue spoken of: as whā Iudas went to the prynces of the preestes / sayenge to them: What wyll ye giue to me, and I shal gyue hym in to your handes? Whiche was done vpon the wednysday as we sayd before in the fyrst part of this boke.Particle. 8. At whiche tyme this con∣tracte was than begun & promysed.Luce. 22. A. As saynt Luke sayeth: Pacti sunt ei pecuniam dare, et ipse Iudas spopondit. The Iues dyd couenaunde and promise to gyue hym money / and Iudas promi∣sed to fulfyll his sayenge. Though (I say) this sellynge was be∣gun vppon the wednysdaye: yet it was nat perfourmed vnto the tyme that Iudas went from our lorde and his apostles after sup∣per vppon the thurseday in the night, vnto the prynces of the Iu∣es, and there receyued his money / that is, thyrty pennys of syl∣uer /
and so was that sellynge perfourmed / and this article appe∣red in effecte. And it is conuenient that this sellynge be num∣bred amonges the poyntes of Christes passion: for therby he suf∣fered great dispisynge. What is nat a great rebuke & dispisynge to Christe, that he whiche is moost noble and good, and of infi∣nite goodnes, in whom be all treasures of wysdom & knowledge hyd / whiche is also lorde of all lordes, and kynge aboue all kyn∣ges: to be estemed and solde for so vyle a pryce? Also the sorow of Christe was moche encreased, in that that he was solde so vile∣ly of his owne disciple / of one of those twelue whom he dyd chose singulerly amonges all the world to be his apostels and messan∣gers. And of this the prophet greatly complaineth in the person of Christe,Psalm. 54. sayenge: Si inimicus meus maledixisset mihi: sustinu∣issem vti{que}. Yf myne enemye had dyspysed me: I shulde quietely haue suffered and borne it.Psalm. 40. And in an other psalme: Etenim ho∣mo pacis mee in quo speraui qui edebat panes meos magnificauit su∣per me supplantationem. O, or truely the man of my peace (that pretendyd loue and peace to me) in whom I trusted / (for he kept all the mony that we had for the necessities of me & myn apostles / and also for to releue the pore people) whiche eat my bread & meat (sat at the meat with me) This man (and pretense frende I say) hathe magnyfyed agaynste me his supplantacion / his pryuye and mooste craftye treason. He craftely and deceytefully hathe trayterously betrayed me and solde me. O vnwyse and moost wretchyd and vnhappy marchaunt / who hath lerned or taughte the suche marchaundyse: that thou shouldest put the pryce of thy marchaundyse to the wyll of the byers / that the byer shulde make the pryce thereof. Whan a thynge is folde (yf it be thoughte precyouse, or of any greate valoure: the marchaunte that sellyth it, wyll nat put the pryce of the same in the arbytremente or wyll of the byer, that he shulde make the pryce at his pleasure. But yf the seller or marchaunt set lytle or nought by the thyng that he selleth: than he regardeth nat yf the byer make the pryce. And so dyd Iudas, whan he solde our sauioure Iesu Christe. For he sayd to the Iues: Quid vultis mihi dare, et ego eum vobis tradam? What wyll ye gyue to me, and I shall betray hym and gyue hym into your handes and power. As yf he sayd: Make what pryce ye wyll: and I shall fulfyll your wyll. O moost wycked cruel∣tie. O moost craftye wyckednes. The creature sellyth his crea∣toure and maker. The dyscyple, his mayster / the seruaunte, his lorde / the famylyar, his moost dere frende. There be many
now a dayes lyke vnto Iudas / which wyl sell & forsake iustice for temporall lucre / & so they sell god, that is very iustice. So do all they that commyt symony / which sell the grace of god, or ye sacra∣mentes of the chyrche / or els spirituall thynges: for temporall thinges. As thoo prelates & iudges that sell the true & iust sentēce / that is, whiche wyll nat gyue the iust & true sentence without re∣wardes. Also thoo religiouse persons & prestes yt wyll nat pray, say masse, or ministre the sacramentes without money. All these with suche other, be lyke vnto Iudas / & say with hym (though nat in wordes, yet in dedes) what wyl ye gyue to me: & I shal betray Christ & gyue hym to you?Micheas 3. D. Of these maner of persons, it is wry∣ten by the Prophete Micheas: Principes eius in muneribus iudi∣cabant, et sacerdotes eius in mercede docebant. The prynces and iudges dyd iudge for gyftes / & the prestes taught for rewardes. And note that the syn of simony is nat onely in the seller: but also in the byer or receyuer. And so nat onely Iudas dyd synne in the sellyng of Christe: but also the Iues in byeng of hym. That per∣son doeth bye Christe of me, which gyuyng to me any temporall thyng: taketh Christ frō me. As yf a flaterer wold falsly cōmende & praise me, where as I am nat worthy / by the whiche laude and prayse, my hert is exalted in pryde: he taketh Christ fro me / & I, consentynge to yt praise: do sell & betray Christe for a lytle vayne glory or prayse. In lyke maner, a man gyuynge to me money or any other thynge so mouyng me to mortall synne: he wolde take Christe from me. And I consentynge to the same: do betray & sell Christe. And yet neither he by his byenge may reteyne and kepe Christe / neither I with my sellynge, may kepe Christe with my selfe, nor with the byer. And so neither Iudas nor the Iues had Christe to theyr saluacion / but by that bargayne he was purcha∣sed and gotten to vs christians that truely serue Christe. Many people in the remembraūce of this sellyng, that was made on the wednisday: do fast or absteyn frō flesshe for the loue of Christe. ¶Two doctrynes or holsom lessons. THe fyrst lesson is, that we shulde be well ware that we neuer commytt so abhomynable syn / that is, to sell our lorde / as to bere false wytnes for rewardes or gyftes / or in iudgement to denye the truthe / that is, to selle Christe, whiche is verye Iustice and truthe. And generally to speke: that we neuer sell
spirituall thynges for temporall lucre. The seconde doctrine is, that we paciently suffre to be solde, dispised and set at nought for the loue and laude of god / sayenge with the prophete.Psalm. 68. Quoni∣am propter te sustinui obprobrium. I haue suffered & borne rebuke for the good lorde. In consyderynge this article: let a man re∣membre his owne vylenes / and whether he hathe solde Christe, omyttynge or brekyng his commaundementes for any temporall thynge or vayne loue. Remembre also how that whan he hath solde Christe: he hathe recouered and gotten hym agayne freely of the mere goodnes of god. Remembre furthermore, yt Christe is yet to be boughte / and that is with charitie or good werkes. Therfore bye thou hym with almes. And yf thou haue no money or goodes to gyue: gyue to hym than thy hert / for yt is the thynge whiche he loueth and desyreth aboue all the thynges in the world / and therfore he sayeth by the wyse man:Prouerb. 23. C. Fili prebe mihi cor tuum. Son, gyue to me thy hert / and yf thou loue me: I wyll loue the. And than pray thus as foloweth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu, whiche woldest be set at nought, and solde of one of thy disciples for a vyle pryce: graunte to me that I neuer chaunge the my god and creatour for any transitory thynges / and also that I may paciently bere al rebukes and dispisynges for the glory of thy holy name. Amen. ¶Of the betrayenge of our lorde. The .iiii. article. THe .iiii. article is, of the treason of Iudas / how trayterously he betrayed our lorde. Whan the vendition or sellyng was consumate and put in effect. In the mean tyme our lorde beynge in his prayers, and than thryse cummynge to his dis∣ciples:Mat. 26. E at the last tyme he said to them: Surgite, eamus, ecce appropinquauit qui me tradet. Arise, go we / he that shall betray me, is nigh at hande. In these fewe wordes, our lord doeth fyrst enfourme vs to spede vs to spirituall battell or temptacion, in this worde aryse. Secondly he moueth vs to profyte in good werkes, in this worde, go we. Thyrdely, in the other wordes folowynge: he moueth vs to awayte at all tymes and houres for temptacion / for our enemies be euer redye to tempte vs.Mat. 26. E It foloweth in the gospell: Et adhuc eo loquente.
Ecce Iudas vnus de duodecim cum accepisset cohortem venit. &c.Ioh. 18. A. Our sauyour Christe, yet spekynge to his disciples: Loo, Iu∣das, one of the .xii. apostles of Christ, after that he had taken his money and a great cumpany of souldiers (to the numbre of fyue hundreth, as Papias sayeth) he cam, & with hym a great numbre of people with lanternes and burnynge brondes / with armour, swerdes, battes, and clubbes, sent from the prynces of the prestes and pharisies from the scrybes and the seignours of the people. Wherof saint Austin sayeth:Marc. 14. E. What shulde suche a great people do to seche one person? What shulde tho armed men do, to seche one man without armour or weapon? What shulde they seche hym in the nyghte, that was dayly teachynge, and that openly in theyr temple?Cap. 24. A. This acte was fygured in the fyrst boke of the kynges / where as Saule toke thre thousande armed men to seche for Da∣uyd.Su{per}. Ioh. 18. And note here (as maister Lira sayeth) that Iudas dyd arme and defende hym selfe fyrst with a great cumpany / stronge, and of auctoritie / and that was agaynste the multitude of the co∣mon people, that they shulde nat let hym in his purpose. Se∣condly, he cam with great lyghtes / that Christe shulde nat escape from hym in the darkenes of the nyght. And thyrdly, he defen∣dyd hym selfe with armour / that yf any body wolde resyst theym: they wolde defende them selfe, & also put the other people a backe. And Iudas that promysed to betraye Christe: gaue to his cum∣pany a pryuy token or sygne / sayenge: Quemcum{que} osculatus fue∣ro,Marc. 14. E. ipse est: tenete eum et ducite caute. Whom so euer I kisse: that same is Christe. (This he spake, that they shuld nat take Iames the lesse for Christe / for he was very lyke in face vnto Christe). And furthermore Iudas sayd / whom I kysse: holde hym, and lede hym warely. For sum of theym thoughte that he wroughte by nygromancie or wytchecrafte.Luce. 11. C. For they sayd an other tyme of hym / that he caste oute deuylles in the power of Beelzebub, the prynce of the deuylles.Ioh. 18. A. It foloweth in the gospell of saynte Iohn̄: Sciens Iesus omnia que ventura erant super eum processit. Iesus knowynge all thynges and aduentures that shulde cum vnto hym: wente towardes theym and met with theym, that all men myght know that he was taken voluntarilie with his owne wyll. And anon Iudas approchynge towardes hym, sayde: Aue rabi.Mat. 26. E Hayle mayster. Et appropinquauit vt oscularetur eum. Iudas drewe nygh,Luce. 22. E to the intente that he myght kysse Christe / and so he dyd. In this poynt there be thre thynges expressed:
that made this betrayenge moche paynefull or sorowfull vnto Christe. One is, that it was done by one of his owne disci∣ples. The seconde is, that he so falsely and trayterousely be∣trayed Christe with the sygne or token of peace,Su{per} Lucā li. 10▪ ca. 95. and kysse of loue or frendeshyppe. Of the whiche saynt Ambrose sayeth: O Iu∣das, thou woundest thy mayster & lorde with the token or pledge of loue / and thou bryngest hym to dethe with the kysse of familia∣ritie and frendeshyppe. The thyrde, was nat lesse paynefull, that the false traytoure with his stynkynge mouthe durst touche or kysse that mooste louely and mellifluouse mouthe of Christe, the eterne sonne of god. If it be paynefull to a man to kysse the mouthe of hym that hathe a stynkynge brethe: how moche more was it than paynefull to oure fauyour Christe, to take a kysse of that mooste synfull and stynkynge mouthe of Iudas / whose herte was replenysshed with the deuyll and all wyckednes. And than Iesus sayde vnto hym:Luc. 22. E. Iuda, osculo filium hominis tradis▪ Iudas, wylte thou betraye the sonne of a vyrgyn, thy mayster vnto the dethe with a kysse or token of peace? All traytours vn∣to truthe, feynynge the truthe: do vse this same token of frende∣shyppe, a kysse.Mat. 26. E Also Christe sayde vnto Iudas: Amice, ad quid venisti? Frende, for what intente cummest thou? He called Iudas frende, onely to rebuke hym for his false dissimu∣lacion. I do nat remembre that this worde Amice in the voca∣tyfe case: that is, O frende: is spoken to any one good persone / but to euyll persones, it is dyuerse and many tymes spoken. As is sayde in the gospell of saynte Mathew:Mat. 22. B Amice, quomodo huc intrasti?. &c. O frende, how dyddest thou entre vnto this feaste, nat hauynge a conuenient garment? And also in an other place is sayde thus:Mat. 20. B Amice, non facso tibi iniuriam. O frende, I do vnto the non iniurie or wronge. And here now at this tyme. O frende, wherefore cummest thou? As he myghte say: Thou kyssest me, to the ende to betraye me vnto the dethe. To gyue a kysse: it is a sygne or token of a frende / but thou cum∣mest nat therefore, ne to that intente. And nat withstandynge that thou haste done cruelly and trayterously agaynste me: yet retourne to me, and I shall gladly receyue the, as a frende to the. And so wolde Christe haue don (after all doctours) yf he had re∣tourned and bene sorye for his synne and wretchydnes. But he was so indurate and so obstinate of herte, that none of all these thynges coulde call or reuoke hym agayne, or make hym to leue his false and trayterouse purpose / and so he kyssed hym.
A fygure herof we haue in ye seconde boke of kynges.Cap. 20. C. Where as ye the false traytoure Ioab toke his cosyn Anasa by the chynne / kys∣synge hym, and sayenge Salue mi frater. Haile my brother / and so slew hym with that worde. Our lorde called Iudas by his pro∣pre name, to the intent to prouoke hym to grace, and nat to mys∣chief / but he wolde nat receyue grace. O thou innocent lambe Iesu, what doest thou in cumpany with that wolfe Iudas, that wyll deuoure the. Morally, Iudas betokeneth the worlde / whiche doeth smyle or laugh vpon vs: whan he gyueth to vs ry∣ches at our pleasure. Than he kisseth vs: whan he gyueth to vs solace and worldly pleasure. But than doeth he halse vs: whan he gyueth to vs honours and dignities. And in all these he deceiueth vs, and betrayeth vs into eternall dethe. As witnesseth Iob, say∣enge: Ducunt in bonis dies suos:Iob. 21. B. et in pūcto ad inferna descēdunt. These worldly people lede theyr lyfe here in pleasure: and in an instant they descende downe to hell. ¶Here foloweth two lessons. THe fyrst lesson. Who so euer fayneth to loue his neigh∣bour, and secretly worketh euyll agaynst hym: he be∣trayeth his neighboure. Whiche false dissimulacion: our lorde taketh as done to hym selfe / for so he sayeth: What so euer ye do to one of my leest seruauntes:Mat. 25. D I take it as done to my selfe. The seconde is, that we shulde nat hate our aduersaries: but louyngly and charitably correcte theym / as Christe dyd Iudas. ¶A Prayer. O Iesu that suffered thy selfe to be betrayed by a kysse of Iu∣das: graunt to me that I neuer betray the in my selfe, nor in my neighbour. And also, that I neuer deny to myne aduersa∣ries thoffice of loue / that is, charitie / to loue them, and to correct them with charitie. Amen. ¶Of the takynge of Christe. The .v. article. THe .v. article, is the takyng of Christe. Which was done in this maner. What tyme the wycked Iudas had kyssed our lorde / Iesus knowynge what shuld cum vppon hym self: went vnto the cumpanye of the souldiers & of the Iues that cam with Iudas, & sayd vnto them:Ioh. 18. A. Quem queritis?. &c. Whom seche
you? And they sayd, Iesus of Nazareth. And Iesus sayd to thē, I am. At whiche worde, they went backewarde, and so fell vnto the grounde backewarde. And here note that they that fall backe∣warde: do nat se where they fall. Signifienge thereby, that they fall from grace,Su{per}. Ioh. tra. 112. B. into synne / from god, vnto the deuyll / from he∣uym, into hell. And here also saynte Austyn sayeth: Yf he that cam to be iudged, caste his aduersaries downe with one worde: what shall he do whan he shall cum to iudge all the worlde? Yf he dyd thus whan he came to dye: what shall he doo to his enemies whan he shall cum with great power & maiestie to reigne in glo∣ry for euer? Surely he shall than cast his enemies backeward in∣to euerlastynge paynes with this terryble worde:Mat. 25. D Go ye cursed in to euerlastynge fyre. And whan his aduersaries the Iues were rysen agayne, Iesus sayd / agayne vnto them: whom seche you? whom wolde ye haue? And they aunswered, Iesus of Na∣zareth. Here was a meruelouse thynge / they knewe hym nat / nor yet his owne disciple Iudas whiche cam to betray hym. And this is as great a signe or token that may be: that he was nat taken, but at his owne wyll / and therefore he gaue theym licence to take hym,Ioh. 18. B. whā he sayd: Si ergo me queritis: sinite hos abire. Yf ye seche me, or wolde haue me: suffre these that be with me, to departe without hurte or trouble. Our lord was diligent to helpe his dis∣ciples, that they shulde nat be taken / that his wordes whiche he sayd the same nyght after supper:Ioh. 17. B. shuld be true / that is: Quos de∣disti mihi:Ioh. 18. B. non perdidi ex eis quem{quam}. Father, I haue nat lost any of them, whom thou haste gyuen to me. And so his disciples esca∣ped thrugh the goodnes and power of Christe / that afterwarde by them myght be shewed the worde of helth, the gospell of Christe, thrughout the hole worlde. The disciples of Christe, seynge and perceyuyng what was lyke to cum to theyr maister Christe, sayd vnto Christe:Luce. 22. E Domine si percutimus gladio. Maister, shall we smyte with the swerde?Ioh. 18. B. Petre beynge hasty, and nat abydynge the aunswere of our lorde: drew out his swerde, and smote at one of the bysshop seruauntes called Malchus / and cut of his ryghte eare.Su{per} Mat. To signifie (as Origene sayeth) that thoughe it be sene or thought that they here the law of god:Omel. 35. that is onely with the lefte eare / for they onely here the shadow and the lettre of the law: and nat the truthe and misterie therof. Also Petre that cut of this right eare: may signifie to vs the faithfull people of the gentiles / the whiche in that that they beleuyd in Christe: were the cause by occasion, that the ryght herynge of the Iues was cut away. But
yet that same ryght eare was restored agayne by the goodnes of god,Luce. 22. F. vnto those Iues that beleuyd in Christe / and therefore he touched the eare of that seruant: and cured hym / shewynge there in dede,Mat. 5. G. that whiche he taught before / sayenge: Bene facite his qui oderunt vos. Do good to them that hate you. And this he dyd as well for the conuersion of the people that were there presente, or that shulde here thereof: as for our instruction. He cured hym, that shortely after shulde buffet hym and smyte hym / for oure ex∣ample / that we shulde do good agaynst euyll.Su{per} Lucā. And hereof say∣eth Bede:Capitu. 89. Our mercifull lorde wyll neuer forget his pitie / which also wolde nat suffre his enemies to be wounded. And therefore he sayd to Petre and his disciples:Luce. 22. F. Sinite vs{que} adhuc. Suffre yet. As yf he had sayd: Suffre the Iues to cum and take me. Who so euer taketh the swerde and smyteth without auctoritie: they shal peryssh with the swerde. In these wordes also he thretened & mo∣nisshed the people / whiche had no auctoritie to slee hym. He sayd furthermore to Petre:Mat. 26. E An putas quia non possum rogare patrē me∣um, &c. Thynkest thou that I may nat desyre my father for helpe yf I wold / & he wolde sende to my helpe aboue .xii. legions of aū∣gelles.Ioh. 18. B. Euery legion conteineth .vi.M.vi.C.lx.vi. Wyl nat thou that I shuld be obedient to my father, & drynke of the cuppe / that is, to suffre payne & dethe / the which my father wyll that I shuld drynke or suffre / Yf nat, how shall the scriptures be fulfylled, that sayeth, that these thynges must be done? Therefore now set all vengeaunce a parte / and let vs be pacient. And than our lorde sayd to the people that cam to take hym:Mat. 26. F Tan{quam} ad latronem existis cum gladiis et fustibus comprehendere me. Ye cum with swordes & clubbes, to take me as yf I were a thefe. As yf he sayde: Why do ye nat cum to take me quyetly and without suche violence / for I was dayly in your temple amonges you teachynge. Yf ye wolde haue had me: ye myght than haue taken me quietly at your plea∣sure. But this is your hour and tyme graunted vnto you to take me. This is the power of the prynce of darkenes, that hath styr∣red you to do thus. O what myldenes was in our sauioure Ie∣su Christe / that so gentylly spake vnto his aduersaries / and so lo∣uyngely rebuked theym, to swage theyr malyce and iniquitie / and also to moue vs to folowe his benignitie and gentylnes. This nat withstandynge, the souldyers and the mynysters of the Iues layd vyolent handes vppon our lorde Iesu, and so toke hym. And though he was taken of his owne free wyll: yet that captiuitie and takynge was moche paynefull to hym.
For sythe it is paynfull to euery man that is put in captiuitie / for as moche as thereby his libertie is taken from hym, and he put in to thraldome / his libertie (I say) is taken from hym / as well the libertie of condicion, as of operacion and werkynge. The li∣bertie of condicion is taken from hym. For after the Ciuile law: he is in bondage and thraldome. Also his libertie of operacion is taken from hym. For he that is so taken, can nat werke & do what he wyll: but as it shall please hym that hath hym in captiuitie. For these causes (as ye may perceyue) it is moche paynefull for a man to be put in captiuitie: moche more than it was paynefull to our lord Iesu (whiche is the lorde and maker of heuyn and erth / and whom heuyn or erth can nat comprehende nor take) to be ta∣ken and holden in captiuitie with the violent handes of so cruell persones. And in this acte was verified the sayenge of Dauyd / whiche said of Christe many yeres before:Psalm. 58. Ecce ceperunt animam meam, irruerunt in me fortes. Beholde (sayeth Christe by the pro∣phete) stronge and cruell persons hath fallen vpon me, and they haue taken me.Psalm. 93. And in an other psalme: Captabunt in animam iusti, et sanguinem innocentem condemnabunt, They shall take in∣to captiuitie the rightuouse person / and they shall condempne the innocent blood.Tren̄. 3. F. Also the prophet Hieremie sayeth: Venatione ce∣perunt me quasi auem inimici me. Myne enemies hath taken me with theyr huntynge, as a byrde in a snare or with an hawke. Thus our true Ioseph (Iesus Christe) was taken of his bre∣theren and led into Egipte / that is, into angwyssh and tribulaci∣on. And so I say they toke hym and bounde hym / as we shall de∣clare in the next article. ¶A lesson. OF this article we may take a moral lesson / that as Christ for our loue dyd suffre hym selfe wylfully to be taken of the Iues: so we for his loue shulde subdue our selfe and all our sencys vnto the obsequye and seruyce of Christe: accordynge to the sayenge of the apostle / subduynge our wyt and reason to the fayth and seruice of Christe.2. Cor. x. B ¶A prayer. O Iesu Christe, the sonne of the lyuyng god, which wolde be wylfully taken and holden of the Iues: graunt to me that I may continually subdue all my sencys and vnder∣standynge
vnto thy seruyce / that by thy infinite goodnes, I may be delyuered from eternall dethe and captiuitie. Amen. ¶Of the byndynge of our lorde. The .vi. article. THe syxt article, is the byndynge of our lorde. For the Iues, after that they had taken Christe: they bounde hym so harde and strayte: that (after saynt Anselme) the bloode sprange out of euery fynger ende vnder the nayles. They boūde his blessyd handes behynd hym / they cast hym downe vppon the erthe, as he before had cast them downe by his godly power. Moreouer they dyd trede vpon his brest / and spued or spytted in his face. Also they so harde boūde hym by the necke and throte: that he was nygh strangled, yf god had nat preserued hym for a tyme, that he shulde suffre more and greater paynes after this tyme. They bounde hym for thre cau∣ses. Fyrste, that he shulde nat escape theyr handes. For Iudas bad them holde hym fast, and lede hym warely. Secondely, for they intendyd to sley hym. For it was a custome amonges the Iues, that whom they iudged worthy dethe: he shulde be boūde and so presented to the president and iudge. Thyrdly, he wold be bounde for a misterie, for bycause he cam to lawse and delyuer them that were bounde with the bondes of synne, and also those that were bounde as prysoners in Limbo patrum: therefore he wolde be wylfully bounde as a thefe, thoughe he were all inno∣cent and without spot of synne. Our fyrst father Adam dyd com∣myt theft, what tyme he ate of thapple that was forbydden hym / for whose syn all mankynde was taken and holden by the deuyll as theuys. For whose satisfaction Iesus Christ wolde be taken as a thefe / though in hym selfe he be incomprehensible. Also he wolde be bounde: whiche cam to lawse them that were bounde. And they bounde hym with thre ropes or bondes. One about his handes. The seconde, about his necke. And sum do say that that was a chayne of yron. And the thyrde, about his myddell. And these bē represented in the ornamentes of the preest at his masse. The fyrste, by the maniple vpon his arme. The seconde, by the stole in his necke. And the thyrde by the gyrdell. O my moost dere beloued Iesu, the very true vyne. Who is he that doeth nat se and consyder the bondes wherewith this oure vyne tree was bounde? He was bounde with seuen bondes. The fyrste (sayeth saynt Bernarde) I trow, was his obedience, whereby he was
obedient to his father, vnto the death of the crosse. He dyd also o∣bey to his mother Marie, and to his father putatiue Ioseph. As saynt Luke sayth:Luce. 2. G. Venit Nazareth: et erat subditus illis. Iesus came to Nazareth with mary and Ioseph, and was obedient to them. He was also obedient vnto the emperour, paynge tribute vnto hym.Mat. 17. D & 22. C. The second bonde was the wombe of the virgyn Ma∣rie. Hereunto the churche syngeth of our lady in a certen respond, whom the heuens coulde nat take: thou virgyn hath conteyned hym in thy wombe.Luc. 2. The thyrde bonde was his cradell bondes or the cryb, wherin he was layde / as saynt Luke sayth. The .iiii. bonde was this bonde, wherwith he was bounde whan he was taken. O howe rughe and harde were these bondes of these moste cruell Iues, wherwith they bonde that most mylde lambe Iesus Christe. O good Iesu, I considre and se with the eyen of my soule, the swete lorde bounde with moost harde ropes and drawen as a thefe, to the house of the prynce of preestes. I se this good lorde, and I abhorre it, and also moche meruayle thereat, and so meruaylynge / I shulde faynte and also dye for sorowe, but that manifestly I knowe that thou was fyrste bounde in thy herte with the bondes of loue and charitie, whiche louyngly dyd drawe the to suffer gladely these outwarde bondes. The fyrste bonde was that wherwith he was fastyned to the pyllar whan he was scourged, of the whiche we shall speake hereafter. The syxte bonde, was the crowne of thornes wherewith his heed was faste bounde, as we shall declare hereafter. The seuenthe bonde were the nayles that nayled his handes and feete faste vnto the crosse.Li. 1. ca. 10. G. & Li. 4. cap. 70. B. Or elles we may saye after saynte Birgitte in her reue∣lations, that this seuenthe bonde, was that corde and rope wher¦with they drewe his arme and his feete, so that all the ioyntes of his body were dissolued,Ancelm{us} in dialogo pas¦sionis. M. for fyrste they nayled his ryghte hande and then they drewe the left hand with a rope vnto the hoole that was made before for that hande. And in lyke maner they drewe his feete, so that al his veynes and synewes brast, and all his ioyn∣tes loosed, so that a man myght nombre all his bones, as the pro∣phet Dauid sayth.Psal. 21. And this payne was so great & greuous that the lyfe myght nat continue with it in any other man, but Christe preserued his lyfe vnto suche tyme it pleased hym to yelde vp his spirit into ye handes of his father,Iohā. 10 D. & therfore he said: Potestatē ha∣beo ponēdi āam meā & nemo tollit eā a me. I haue power to gyue vp my soule at my pleasure. Also no man may take my life frō me, but I shall forsake it at my wyll, and at my wyll take it agayne.
Our sauyour Iesu thus taken and bounden, al his disciples for∣sakynge hym for feare fledde from hym, as we shall declare in the nexte article. ¶Here foloweth .iii. lessons. THe first lesson is our lord wolde be bounde, bycause that he wold loose the bōdes of our synnes. Second∣ly he wold be bounde, for that he wolde bynde vs to hym with the bonde of charite. He is the same bonde of charitie wherwith our soule is bounden to god. He is signifyed by the reed coorde or lyne, whiche Raab tyed in the wyndowe of hyr house for a sure signe or token that she and al hyrs, shulde be saued at the destruction of Hiericho. So surely euery faythfull soule corrupte by the olde synne of Adam, and so signifyed by Raab that is comonly noted for a comen woman,Iosue. 2. C. . 6. D. yf this soule be regenerate by the fayth of Christ, and haue this reed corde tyed in the wyndowe of hyr inwarde house, by the whiche the lyght of god entrethe in to hyr soule, without doubte suche a soule hath a sure token of hyr health, for suche a soule is so tyed vn¦to god, and god vnto hyr: that she can nat lyghtly be separat from god. This is also the corde or rope wherwith our lord was tyed vnto the pillar, whiche without doubte was reed, for it was made reed with the holy blode of Christ.Rom. 8. B. This is also that lyne or corde wherwith Paule was so surely fastened to Christe, that nothyng myght depart hym from Christ. Nother tribulation / ne anguish nor hungre / nor nakednes / persecution nor swerde / and shortly to speake, no creature myght departe hym from the charite of Christ The thyrde lesson is that we shuld so bynde all our membres, and specyally our tonge / with the cordes of the preceptes of god, that she shulde nat be loosed vnto any thynge contrarie to the wyll of god or his commaundementes. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wold be bounde with the handes of wycked men. I beseche the loose the bondes of my synnes, and so bynde me to the with the bondes of thy preceptes, that ne∣uer the membres of my body, nor the powers of my soule be loosed and at lybertie to do any thynge contrarie to thy wyll. Amen.
¶Of the fleynge or departynge away of the disciples of Christe. The .vii. article. THe .vii. article is of the departyng awaye or fleyng of the disciples of Christe. Of the whiche it is wryten in the gospel thus:Mat. 26. F Tunc omnes relicto eo fugerunt. Whan Iesus was taken, then all his disciples lefte hym and fled from hym. This fleynge and departyng was no lytell payne to Christe. And therfore this article is nombred with the other articles of his passion, for specyally he was sory for this maner of departynge. And of this departynge speaketh Iob in the person of Christ sayenge.Iob. 19. B. Fratres mei elongauerunt a me et no ti mei quasi aliem recesserunt a me. My bretherne haue gone farre from me and myne aquayntance or knowen disciples as straun∣gers hath forsaken me. And in a token or remembraunce of this forsakyng: the aulters on shire thursday be bared, for all theyr or∣namentes be taken awaye, and the aulter lefte naked and bare. Christ is this aulter. and the apostles be the ornamentes, whiche fled from Christ, and left hym alone in the hādes of his enemies. Our lorde was heuy and sory of this departyng of his discyples, nat for hym selfe: but for them, that they were so sclaundered in hym. Of this sorowe saynt Ierome saythe: It is nat to be bele∣ued that this departynge was without greate anguysshe and he∣uynes of the herte of Christe, and also it was nat without greate mornynge and wepynge of the apostles. For I can nat thynke that after they se that cruell compeigney take and bynde our saui∣our Iesu theyr most louynge maister: but that they wept and said with greate sorowe. O moost benygne maystre / more swete or pleasaunte than all hoony. It is moche sorowfull to vs to se the so cruelly entreated of the malycyous Iues. Alas, we wretches, what shall we do, leauynge so gracyouse a father, we forsake all our goodes and folowe the, and nowe we perceyue for a suerty that we shalbe pryued of thy presence / and wante thy confortable wordes and dedes, for we be assured nowe that the Pharyseys wyll sley the. O howe ofte (suppose you) dyd they looke backe towardes theyr moost mercyfull mayster, seynge and beholdyng with bytter sorowe theyr lorde so cruelly ledde of the malicyouse Iues, as we shall declare in the next article.
¶Here foloweth .vi. causes of the fleyng or departynge of Christes disciples. OF these disciples:Psal. 21. the prophet speaketh in the person of our lorde sayenge: Dispersa sunt omnia ossa mea. All my boones are disperpled or deuyded, that is all my apostles, whiche / as bonys in a mannes bo∣dye shulde haue ben most stronge, and yet they are fled and fallen. And that for .vi. causes. The fyrst cause was that the doctrine of Christe god and man, was forgo∣ten then of them,Psalm. 21. and therfore the prophet Dauid sayth: Factum est cor meum tan{quam} cera liquescens so medio ventris mei, My herte is made as wax meltynge in the mydle of my body, that is. My doctrine is vanysshed throughe the heete and fyer of my passyon, and that in the myddle of my bely, that is, in my apostles that be moost nyghe vnto me. The seconde cause, was the ceasynge of myracles. Of the whiche, also it folowethe in the forsayde .xxi. psalme: Aruit tan{quam} testa virtus mea. My vertue and power is as drye as a shell. And that was bycause he suffred hym selfe to be taken, and so put to most cruell and shamefull deathe, and wolde nat helpe hym selfe and shewe his power as he had done dyuerse tymes before. But nowe he wold nat so do / & therfore his power of in shewynge of myracles semed to be consumed and dryed by the heete and fyere of hys passyon, and hereunto speakethe the prophet,Abacuch. 3. A. saynge: Ibi abscondita est fortitudo eius. There was hyd his power or strength that is in his crosse or passyon. And note / that the sayde not, his power was lost, but his strength was hyd in his passyon, as we shall declare in the thyrde parte of this treatyse in the .iiii. fruyte. The thyrde cause was the silence of Christe, for at his passyon he wolde nat speke for hym selfe. Ther∣fore saith the prophet:Psal. 21. Adhesit lingua mea faucibus meis. My tong cleuyd faste to my iawes or chekes, for he wolde nat speake to his owne excuse, and therfore the prophet Esay long before this tyme sayd of hym:Cap. 53. C. Quasi agnus coram tondente se obmutescet et non ape riet os suum. He shalbe as domme as a lambe whan he is shorne, and he shall nat open his mouthe. And this prophycie was ve∣rifyed in Christe as it is playnly wryten in the gospell:Mat. 17. B Et non respondit e ad vllum verbum, ita vt miraretur preses. Christe an∣swered nat one worde vnto Pylate, whiche meruayled moche therof. The .iiii. cause was that they were in a maner sure of the deth of Christ, but they were in a dispeyre or mistrust of his resur¦rectiō. And therfore the {pro}phet Dauid saith in ye person of Christ.
Et in puluerem mortis deduxisti me.Psal. 21. Thou hast brought me in to asshes, or in to the dust of deth. And this he spake after the opi∣nyon of the Iues.Psalm. 87. As it appereth in an other psalme: Estimatus sum cum descendentibus in lacum. I am estemed and accompted by the Iues with them that descende in to the lake and pytte of eternall perdition, and neuer to retourne agayne. The .v. cause was the crueltie of the Iues, and therfore the prophet saythe in the persone of Christe:Psalmo. 21. Circumdederunt me canes multi. Many dogges haue compassed me, that is the Iues barkynge and by∣tynge by detraction as dogges. The .vi. cause was the congre∣gation of euyll persones / and therfore it foloweth in the psalme: Consilium malignantium obfedit me.Psal. 21. The congregation and coun¦sayle of euyll persones haue obsessed and beseaged me. and that very obstinately and fro wardely vnto my deathe. Of this com∣peigney and counsayle speaketh the prophet Dauid in an other psalme sayenge:Psal. 2. Astiterunt reges terre et principes conuenerunt in vnum aduersus dominum et aduersus Christum eius. Rewlers of the worlde and princes ben cume to gyther in counsayle agaynste our lorde and agaynst his sonne Christe. And for these causes the apostles flodde and forsoke our lorde. Whereat wonderynge and meruaylynge the prophet Hieremy saythe:Tren̄. 4. A. Quomodo disper si sunt lapides fanctuarij: Howe is this / that the holy stoones ben disperpled? that is the apostles of Christ whiche shulde haue ben as holy stones strong / stable & firme in the faith & loue of Christe, but they fled.Zach. 13. C. Percutiam pasto rem et dispergentur oues gregis.Mat. 26. C I shall smyte or take the herde∣man, and the shepe of the flocke shalbe disperpled abrode. Here folowethe .ii. lessons. THe fyrste lesson is that we shulde be well ware that we neuer flye from Christe. He flyeth from Christe, that for any feare of man / or by the temptation of the deule or by any passyon or corrupte affection forsaketh the truthe or iustice, for Christe is truth and also iustice. And generally, in euery mortal or deedly synne, a man flieth from god. The seconde lesson is this / that thoughe these persones that seame to be our frendes or neyghbours and louers, flye from vs in the tyme of our aduersytie and necessitye, yet lette vs beare it patiently / remembrynge that the apostles fled from our sauy∣our Christe in his aduersitie and trouble.
¶A prayer. O Iesu that dyd suffre all thyne electe and chosen disciples to flye from the: receyue thou me thy fugitiue seruaunt for thy greate vertue and omnipotent power. And suffre me nat to wandre from the, thorughe the libertie of my frowarde wi. Amen. ¶Of the leadynge of Christe. The .viii. article. THe .viii. article, is of his leadynge. For after that they had taken and bounde hym, and after that his disciples fledde: the Iues led Christ towardes the house of Annas.Capi. 18. E. As it is in the gospell of Iohn̄. And this ledynge was moche laborouse and payne∣full to Christe. Also it was rebukefull and violent. It was violent: for he was led with a great cumpanye of armed men and theyr captayne with them. It was also rebukefull to Christe, for he was led with his handes bounde as a thefe or an euyll persone.Ioh. 18. C. And so the Iues sayde to Pilate: Yf this persone (that is Christe) were nat a malifactour or an euyll doer & a mys∣lyuer: we wolde nat haue delyuered hym to thy handes and po∣wer. This ledynge was also laborouse, paynfull, and sorow∣full to hym. And that bothe to the herte inwardely, and also to the bodye outwardely. Fyrste, it was sorowfull inwardely. For where euer herde you of any man, that wolde nat be heuy in hert, and inwardly sory, to be lad with the handes of his enemies, so cruelly, with so great a cumpany of armed men, with suche and so many rebukes and reprouynges, bothe in worde and in dede, as those mooste cruell Iues dyd vnto Christe at that tyme & le∣dynge. That ledyng was also paynfull to his body. For though he wente wylfully with them: yet they drewe hym with a rope, they thrust hym & droue hym forwarde / and oft tymes they thrust hym downe and ranne ouer hym / and so drewe hym thorughe the vale of Iosaphat, from the flood or ryuer of Cedron, vp towar∣des Hierusalem / ledynge hym with great haste and violence, he goynge bare foted / and therefore they greuously hurted & woun∣ded his moost holy fete in that stony and moost harde waye. In so moche, that the steppys of his moost hooly fete were dyed and wet with blood. For cruelly those Iues (whose fete were swyfte & redy to shed the innocent blood) those Iues (I say) moost cru∣elly thrusted hym from the one parte of the waye, vnto the other parte or syde. But wherfore dyd Christe suffre all these paynes
and rebukes, but onely to cure the woundes of our fete, whiche haue gone to do many a synfull dede / and specially the woundes of our spirituall fete and inordinate affections.Cātic. 3. A. 5. C Christe ranne thrugh thornes and breres, sechynge for his shepe that was lost. He sought hym by the brood stretys and narow lanes / and so the watchemen of the citie founde hym / they smote hym, they woun∣ded hym and toke from hym his pall and garmentes. So that it may be well verified of Christ, that is wryten in the fyrst boke of Paralipomenon:Cap. 21. B. Ex omni parte angustie me premunt. Anguyssh, troubles, & paynes oppresse me on euery part. Sum doctours don say, that what tyme the Iues led Christe towardes Hieru∣salem: thy came by the ryuer & water of Cedron, the ministres and the people went ouer the brydge / but they drew Christe boū∣den thrugh the water, so that the watre entred into his mouthe & body. At whiche tyme, what for the coldnes of the water, and al∣so for his longe prayenge in the garden or orcharde: all his body was so colde, that all his tethe dyd quyuer and shake in his hed for colde.Psalm. 68. Herein were fulfylled the sayenges of Dauid: Sal∣uum me fac deus quoniam intrauerunt aque vs{que} ad animam meam. Saue me my lorde god / for the waters haue entred into me. And in an other Psalme:Psal. 109. De torrente in via bibet propterea exal∣tabit caput. He shall drynke of the ryuer in the way, and therfore he shall exalte his hed. And whan they cam to Hierusalem, they dyd nat brynge hym in by the same gate that he wente furthe at, whan he went to Bethany: but by an other gate, called the gol∣den gate. And it was so called: bycause all the golde that was gyuen to Salomon, was brought in by that gate and all other thynges yt were of great valour. By this gate also was brought in all suche sacrifices as were offered in the temple. And for as moche as Christ, whan he entred into this worlde, he cam in by the golden gate / that is by the virgyns wombe: it was conueni∣ent that whan he shulde departe from this worlde vnto his father by his dethe and passion: that he shulde goo to his dethe by this golden gate. And the Iues brought hym in by this gate: bicause there sat at that tyme many Scribes and Phariseis, for the more suretie that the comon people shulde nat take Christe from them. And one doctoure sayeth,Britsch. in 40. lib. Al∣phabet. 44. B. that in that golden gate were grauen & painted the ymages of Patriarches & Prophetes in stone werke. And at the entryng of Christe by this gate: all thoo ymages dyd reuerently inclyne to Christe, as to theyr creatour and maker. Also this same doctoure sayeth, that the multitude of the prestes
and scribes went with a great compaigney vnto the forsayd gate cryenge and sayenge: Beholde the these is taken, the deulisshe person, the deceyuer of the people, the breaker of the lawe, and so they cast durte and clay agaynst hym. Also it is sayd / that from the place where as they toke and bounde hym, vnto the house or palace of Annas, ware .iii. M. passys saue .xv. And here note, that Christ this day in the processe of his passyon, was .ix. tymes led from place to place, as we may playnly se in the gospelles. Fyrste as soone as he was taken and bounde,Ioh. 18. C. he was led vnto the house of Annas.Ibid. D. Secondly from Annas, vnto Caiphas, Third∣ly from Caiphas,Ibid. C. vnto Pylate. Fourthly from pilate, vnto He∣rode. Fyftly from Herode,Lu. 23. A. b. vnto pylate agayne. Sextly the sou¦diours led him in to the courte of the comen haulle,Mar. 15. B motehaule or iudgement house, where as they mocked hym and put a crowne of thornes vpon his heed.Ioh. 19. A. Seuenthly Pilate led hym from that place out vnto the Iues, cladde in an olde purpure garment, and the crowne of thornes vpon his heed.Ioh. 19. C. Eyghtly / Pilate led hym from the motehaule vnto a place called Lichostratos, where as he iudged hym to be crucified.Iohā. 19 D. Neyntly / they led hym from thense vnto the mownte of Caluarie where as they dyd crucifie Christe. ¶Here foloweth a lesson. IN diuers contreis it is a laudable custome amonges faith full christianes, that on good frydaye they go aboute from the mornynge vnto the .ix. houre of the day, that is from .vi. of the clocke vnto .iii. of the clocke at after noone, and visyte .ix. chur∣ches, in the remembraunce that Christe that day was .ix. tymes led from place to place as we sayd before. And nowe for a lesson / they that so visite .ix. churches / I wolde they remembred what Christe suffred in euery place. Fyrste what he suffred whan he was ledde to the house of Annas / and also what he suffred there. Secondly what he suffred in Caiphas house and so furth of al o∣ther, as ye shall se declared herafter in diuerses articles. And also that a man myght conforme hym selfe to this article, he shulde re∣membre how obprobriously and shamefully Christe was led lyke a thefe and a rober, and in this consideration: he shulde haue a full purpose, that he wyll, with the helpe and grace of god, be ap∣plyable to all vertue / and also to suffre / or to do all thynges that shalbe to the wyll and pleasure of god. And let hym pray as folo¦weth / or in lyke maner,Psal. 14. 2. Spiritus tuus bonus deducet me in terram rectam. Thy good spirite shall guyde and lede me in to a ryght∣ful
contrey.Psal. 118. Or thus: Deduc me domine in semita mandatorum tuorum. Leade me good lorde in the pathe of thy cōmaundmen∣tes or any other prayer as god shal put in to your mynde. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche bounde as a thefe and an euyl doer, wolde be led by the armed handes of wicked men from place to place with great rebuke and shame: graunt to me that grace / that I neuer be led vnto any synne, throughe the persua∣sion of the deule / or counsaile of any wicked person, but that I may be leade by the holy spirite vnto all thynges that shalbe plea¦saunt vnto the. Amen. How Christ was presented vnto Annas. The .ix. article. THe .ix. article is of the presentynge of Christe vnto An∣nas. For after they had brought Christ vnto the golden gate of Hierusalem, nat without his great payne, for one drewe hym by his garmēt / another by the necke and the thirde by the heire of his heed / they brought him fyrste vnto Annas bycause his house was in the way, and they thought that they shulde haue ben rebuked: if they had ouerpassed hym, for as moche as he was father in lawe vnto Caiphas, whiche was the high bisshop for that yere. And therfore they first presented Christ vnto Annas / willyng therby to honore Annas, and also to reioyse of that great acte whiche they had done in takyng of Christe,Prouer. 2. C. for as the wise man saith, Letantur impij cum malefecerint. &c. Wic∣ked men be glad whan they do euyl, and they reioyse in their most mischeuous dedes. Also they first presēted Christ vnto Annas, by∣cause that lesse defaut shulde be founde and put in Caiphas for the condempnation of Christ seinge that Christ was also condēp¦ned of suche a wise / sage and also high bisshop as Annas was. In this house of Annas, our lorde suffred .iii. thynges moche payn∣full to hym. The fyrste was the horrible denyenge of Petre. The seconde was the indiscrete question of the bisshop. And the thirde was the myghty stroke that the seruaunte gaue to hym vpon hys face. First he suffred the denyenge of Petre, whiche was horrible and also paynful to Christ for .vi. causes, that is for the multitude of people that were present at that denyenge, second was bycause Petre was so slacke to folowe his maister. &c. these causes and the other .iiii. shalbe declared in the next article.
¶Here foloweth a lesson. IN this article we may take this lesson, that we shuld not be moche afrayed to be presented before a seculer iudge for the loue and fayth of Christe, and to ure for Christe, for therby cometh greate grace to man. Therfore our lorde sayd to his disciples: Whan your enemyes shal betray you and present you vnto ye great iudges of the worlde,Mat. 10. C. be nat afrayed / nor to studiouse what ye shall saye, it shalbe gyuen to you at that tyme by the spirite of god what ye shall saye. And this is noted in this article, in that that Annas is as moche to say by interpretation: as deuotion. Not that An∣nas nor any temporall iudge may gyue to that person whome he iudgethe any grace or deuotion: but for as moche as those holye persones suffre greate wronges of suche iudges: the goodnes of god gyueth to those that paciently suffre iniuryes: his grace, for all grace is of god.Eccl. 32. B. And hereunto the wyse man sayth: Audi ta∣cens, et pro reuerentia accidet tibi bona gratia. Here thou & obey patiently, and for thy reuerence, good grace shal come to the. And that a man myght conforme hym selfe vnto this article: he shulde remembre howe reuerently and paciently our lorde and sauyour Iesus stode then before Annas & the Iues. And then pray thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde be first led and presented vnto the bys∣shop Annas: graunt to me that I neuer feare to be ledde or presented for thy name and faythe, before any tiraunte or seculer iudge of this worlde. And also that thy grace & ryght reason haue euer the dominion in me, that I may lerne to present all myne actes / willes and desyres vnto the examination of right reason before that I do them in dede, thy grace at all tymes be∣ynge assistant vnto me. Amen. ¶Of the denyenge of Petre. The .x. article. THe .x. article is of ye denyeng of Petre, what tyme Iesus was led to the house of Annas, Petre folowed a farre of to se the ende what they wolde do with Christ. There folowed also Iohan whiche was well aquaynted with the bysshopes seruauntes, and knowen to the bysshop, and ther∣fore he entred in with the other Iues into the bysshopes palace,
but Petre abode without. And then Iohn̄ spake to the maide that kept the doore, to let Petre come in. And whan she se Petre: she sayd to hym:Ioh. 18. C. Nū quid et tu ex discipulis es hominib{us} istius? Art thou nat of the disciples of this man? that is of Christe. And Petre sayd: I am nat. The wordes of this mayden myght seme more to be spoken for compassyon of Christe, and to admonysshe Petre to bewarre of suche compeigney as was then within in the courte, rather then to betraye Petre, for she se hym verye fearfull, he was so afrayed that he denyed Christ to be his maister. The ministres and seruauntes stode at the coolys or fyre and warmed themself, and Peter stode amonges them. And then a nother mayden said: This felawe was with Iesu, and the compeigney that was there sayd / truely he is one of them,Mat. 26. G for he is a Galilee, that is a man of the contreth of Galilee. Then Petre denyed it with an othe, and sayd:Luce. 22. F. I knowe nat that man. After that by the space of one houre the compeigney sayd to Petre agayne: veryly / thou arte one of them,Ioh. 19. E. and specyally one persone cosen to Malchus / whose eare Petre smote of: sayd to Petre: Dyd nat I se the in the garthen or orcharde with Iesu? And than Peter began to sweare / to curse and banne and sayd: I neuer knewe this man of whom ye speake and furthwith the cocke dyd synge or crawe.Luc. 22. G. And then our lorde turned hym and behelde Petre. And Petre remembrynge the say∣enges of Christe before, how that he shulde thryse denye hym be∣fore the cocke craw, he went furth of the bisshopes palace or court and wepte full bytterly.Su{per} Mat 26. And here sayth saynt Hierome: Petre myght no longer abyde in derknes, for the lyght of the mercyes of god dyd shyne vpon hym, and therfore he wepte. And Petre after this had euer in vse & custome to stande in prayer and wepe from the fyrst cocke crawe: vnto the sonne rysynge, in the remem∣braunce of his thryse denyenge of Christe. Also he bare alwaye with hym a sudarie, to wype awaye the teares that continually fell from his eyen for his synne. And for the same synne he wepte so moche, that his face seamed to be aduste and burned with the teares. And therfore he deserued to haue forgyuenes both of his synne & of the payne due for his synne. This threfolde negation of Petre, was no lytel payne vnto our sauiour Iesu, for it greued hym very moche to heare & se howe his owne chefe apostle, whom he had ordred to be called a stone, wherupon he wolde founde and buylde his churche, to se hym (I say) so openly and so shamefully thryse to denye his own mayster Christ, & that at the voyce of one mayden or woman. And note here that as a woman was the first
mouer of man vnto synne, so a woman compelled the first prynce and prelate of Christes churche to denye Christe openly, so that by this exemple the infirmite of Petre myght more clerely appere to hym selfe. And this is it that we sayde in the .ix. article, that Christ suffred in the house of Annas, the denyeng of Petre which was shamefull to Petre and moche paynfull to Christe, and that for .vi. causes. Fyrste for the multitude of people that were then present, for he denyed Christe in the bysshopes palace, where as was at that tyme, moche people gathered, and therfore this synne was moche more greuous, than if it had ben done in a pryuate and secrete place. Secondly, it was the more shamefull to Petre / for his slaknes in folowynge Christe, for he folowed a farre of / thoughe before he had spoken and made his boste that he wolde rather dye then denye hym. The thyrde cause was the vylenes of the persone that moued the question vnto Petre, for it was a wo∣man, nat a noble woman, but a seruaunt, and other vyle seruant{is}, which was so moche the more to ye rebuke of Petre, that he wolde denye his lorde god, at theyr questions. Fourthly for Petre short∣ly and lyghtly denyed Christ at one worde of a pore and vyle ser∣uaunt. The .v. cause is the periurie and cursynge of Petre, for this made his synne moche greuous.Libro. 13. And therfore sayth Symon de Cassia: Petre in his word{is} & his threfold negation, dyd great∣ly rebuke Christe, whiche had chosen so inconstant and vnkyne a person to his disciple and to his chefe apostle. &c. And sextly the greuousnes of Petre synne dyd appere by his great and cōtinuall wepyng, for a great synne requireth great cōtrition and penaūce There be .iii. thynges in this gospel that moued & induced Petre vnto penaunce.Luc. 22. G. The fyrste is syngynge or crawynge of the cocke.Luc. 22. G. The seconde was ye respecte and beholdynge of Christe. And the thyrde was ye remembraunce of the wordes that our lorde sayde to Petre at the supper the same nyght, that was that Petre shulde denye Christ thryse that nyght before the cocke crawe. Our lorde suffred Petre to fall for our example, that no man shuld presume of hym selfe, seynge that the prynce of thapostles dyd fall. And also that no man shuld dispeyre, syth that Petre after so greuous a syn, was made ye porter of heuyn. And thyrdly that Petre shuld lerne to haue cōpassion of his subiect{is}. For shortly after he was to be made the chefe prelate of the churche. But where dyd Petre de∣ny his mayster Christe? Not in ye mount, nor in the temple, nor yet in his owne house, but in the bysshopes palace standyng and warmyng hym selfe by the fyre with the ministres and seruaunt{is}
of the bysshoppes. What signifyeth this palace or court of the bis∣shoppe but worldly couuersacyon and maners. These ministers signify deuylysshe persons. The feare signifyeth carnall concu∣piscence and desyre / who so euer abyde with these companyes: he can not wepe and do penaunce for his synnes. And therfore it is very daungerous and perilouse to be conuersant in the court{is} of prynces, for Peter dyd but ones entre in to the palace of bisshop / and anone he lost the vertu and strength of his soule / and also denyed Christe. What suppose you wolde he haue done if he had longe continued there? I feare that he wolde haue then ben as our preestes be nowe in great mennes houses, that is worse in al poyntes than lay men. But Peter went thens to do penaūs for there he could do none. In lyke maner the sterre that appered to the .iii. kynges in the Est, whan they entred in to Hierusalem in to thepalace and court of Herode: the sterre vaynysshed from theyr syghte / and whan they were departed from thens: it appe¦red to them agayne. ¶Here folowe .vi. lessons. THe first lesson is this / that the prelate of the churche shulde be suche a person as can haue compassyon of the frayltyes and infirmities of his subiectes. The seconde is that no man shulde presume of his owne vertue. The thyrde is that we shulde resist and with stande synne in the begynnynge / for one synne if it be not shortly put a way by penaunce / it wyll drawe to it an other synne more greuous. exemple herof we haue in Peter which at the first tyme he onely denyed his mayster without ony oth or other wordes.Math. 26. G. And the seconde tyme / he denyed hym with an othe.Marci. 14. G. And at the thyrde tyme he cursed / he sware and also he denyed Christe. Here ye may se howe one synne bryngeth in an other synne more greuous than the first. The .iiii. lesson is / that if we fall in to ony synne though it be but a small synne to our thynkynge / and also done of onely frayltye / yet for no cause we shulde perseuer and cotynue therin. For to perseuer in synne (as the glose sayth) it gyuethe an encreasynge to the synne.Eccl. 19. A. For as the wyse man also sayth: He that dispyseth or lytyll regardeth small synnes / by lytyll and lytyll / he shall fall to moche more greuouse synnes.
The .v. lesson is that no man shulde dispeyre of the mercye of god what so euer synne he hath done, but let hym wepe & do penauns for his synnes. &c. The .vi. that we shulde neuer deny Christ, who so euer committeth ony mortal synne: he denyeth Christ / for he consentynge to the deuyll: forsaketh Chryste. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche suffred thy selfe to be denyed thrice of ye prince of thy apostles, whom also thou mercyfully beholdynge / made hym to wepe bytterly for his synne: I beseche the beholde me with the eye of thy mercy that I maye worthelye wepe in thy syght for my synnes / and that I neuer denye the my lord god ney¦ther in worde nor in dede. Amen. ¶Howe our lorde was smyten vpon the cheke. The .xi. article. THe .xi. article of the smytynge of our lorde, for in meane tyme that Peter outward in the courte denyed our lord iii. tymes our sauyour Iesu was in the house: present before the bysshop Annas, where as Annas moued vn∣to Christ an vnwyse and folisshe question before and in the audi∣ence of all the people that were there present that was of his discy¦ples and of his doctrine,Ioh. 18. C. and Iesus answered not one worde of his discyples, for as at that tyme he could speake no good of thē for they all had forsaken hym that nyght / teachynge vs therby, that whan we can nat truely speake ony good of our neyghbours then we shuld kepe silence and speake none euyll of them, though we knowe it. But to the other question of his doctrine Iesus answered shewynge that it was not euyll nor suspecte: but good and holye, and that he proueth by the place and the compeyney where and amonge whome he spake it saynge:Ioh. 18. D. Ego palam locut{us} sum mundo. &c. I spake openly to the people, I euer taught in the sinagoges and in the temple where as the Iues ben gathered togyther / and I spaketh nothynge in priuye corners / therfore in∣quere of them that harde me / for they can tell what I haue sayde and taught, and here our lorde dyd so moderate his answere that nother he wolde hyde the treuthe nor yet be sene to defende hym self / gyuynge to vs a fourme and a maner howe to answere mo∣derately vnto our aduersaries, so that we nother hyde the treuth nor yet prouoke or moue them agaynst vs with our word{is}. Then one of the mynysters smote Chryste vpon the cheke sayenge.
Sic respondes pontifici?Ibidem. Is this a good answere vnto the bishop This stroke was so myghtye and greate / that the sownde therof was herde ouer all the palace / and it was so strongly gyuen that the prynte of his fyngurs remayned in Christes cheke, whiche prynte we may well se and perceyue in the image of his face that he gaue to the blessed woman called Veronica. This image was lately in Rome, and it shulde seame that he myghte not gyue o sore a stroke with his bare hande, and therfore it is moche lykly that he smote Christ with his gawntlette sayng: Is this a good answere vnto a bisshop? this he spake with great arrogance and prowdly without ony reuerence vnto Christ, and this he dyd to please and flatter the bysshop. Of this stroke saint Ambrose saith That it was so paynfull that it had ben sufficyent for mannes re¦demption. It was so vehement / that therby all his teeth in his hed were moued or lowsed, and also his nose and his mouth gus¦shed out of blode. Our lorde wolde abūdantly and plentuously satisfye for our synnes. And therfore he most hygh in noblenes / was smyten of a vyle wretche, god was smyten of a synner, the lord of his seruant, the creature of his creature, the gouerner of the hole worlde of a vyle porcyon of the same worlde, the moste mercyful redemer was smyten of hym whom he came to redeme, if he wolde receyue it. This cōtumely with many other that fo∣loweth our lord suffred for vs with al paciēce & mildnes, so that with great myldnes he answered to hym that smote hym:Ibidem. Si ma∣le locutus sum testimonium perhibe de malo. &c. If I haue spoken euell beare witnes agaynst me of that euyll. But if I haue an∣swered well / truly and conueniently / wherfore dost thou smyte me?Su{per} Iohn̄ trac. Cxiii This answere of Christ as saint Austen sayth / was not spo∣ken of any impacyence / but gentely and swetely he dyd reproue that seruaunt / and called vnto his mynde his vnkyndnes. And herunto saynt Barnarde sayth. O merueylous greate vnkynd∣nes / this same Malchus whom our lorde but a lytyl byfore dyd cure and heale his ryght heare the whiche Peter dyd smyte of. He nowe was bolde to smyte so cruelly his lorde god and curer. O good Iesu in what compaigney arte thou nowe, howe moch was thy pacyence. Howe great was theyr crueltye and inpa∣cyence. But wyll they / nyll they / thy pacyence ouercometh theyr malyce / thy loue theyr enuy / and thy pitye / theyr crueltye. And thus ye may se that this smytyng is cōueniently nōbred among{is} the articles of Christes passyon, also therin was fulfylled the sa∣yng of ye {pro}phet:Tren̄. 3. D. Dabit {per}cutiēti se maxillā: he shall offer his cheke
to the smyter.Mich. 5. A. And an other prophet saith: Percutient maxillam iudicis Israel: they shall smyte the cheke of the iudge of Israell. This stroke was fygured in Michea / whiche was smyten vpon the cheke:Cap. vlt. D bycause he sayde the treuthe vnto Achab the kynge of Israell / as it is writen in the thyrde boke of the kynges. ¶Here foloweth a lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson, sythe that Christe wolde be buffeted and smyten for vs: it is cōuenient that we stoppe our mouthes that we speake no thyng contrary the honour of god, and also that we excite and moue our selfe to speake and do that is good. And in all iniuries and contumelies done vnto vs: that we haue pacyence by the example of Christe, whiche dyd vouchsafe to gyue vs specyally in this poynte an ex∣ample of great pacyence. And also a man to conforme hym selfe vnto this article: may to remember the great stroke of Christe, gyfe hym selfe a moderate clappe or stroke for all his lyes / euyll and vayne wordes, and then pray on this maner. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde be smytten for me moste vnworthy, of the vyle minister and seruant of Annas: graūt to me I be∣seche the thy grace / that I may stoppe my mouthe from all euyll and vayne speache / and that I neuer cease frome thy laude and praysynges. Amen. ¶Howe Iesus was presented vnto Cayphas. The .xii. article. THe .xii. article of the presentacyon of Christe vnto Cay∣phas / whan our lorde had taken that great stroke in the house of Annas, shortly after / Annas sent Christ bound as gyltye and worthy death and therunto condempned by hym, he sent hym (I say) vnto Caiphas / gyuyng thankes vn¦to the ministres that it wolde so please them to brynge Christe first vnto hym.Ioh. 18. D. Annas (I say) sent Christe to Cayphas, for he was the chiefe bishop for that yere, and so to him it apperteyneth principally to entreat of the condemnacyon and death of Christ, and for the same cause there were gathered a great companye of preestes and scribes in the forsayde house of Cayphas to counsell herin. In this house of Caiphas Christe dyd abyde vnto the moornynge, at the whiche tyme he was ledde vnto Pylate.
And in this house he suffred .iii. thynges that were moche payn∣full to hym / that is: the false witneshyng / the crafty adiuracyon and the most dispitefull confutacyon / as it shall appere in the ar¦ticles folowyng. And here note that this presentacyon was more greuous vnto Christ, than the first that was to Annas, for this Cayphas was the cheyfe bysshop for that yere. And also he was more crafty and more malicyous than Annas / and that well ap∣pereth by the interpretacyon of his name. Cayphas is as moche to say by interpretacyon as a crafty or wyly searcher, for he more craftely dyd searche for false witneshes agaynst Christe, & whan he coulde fynde no conuenient testimonye agaynst hym: then he malicyously and craftely by hym self toke occasyon in our lordes wordes of his dampnacyon as we shall declare hereafter in the xiiii. article. O how payneful is it to a good man to be presen∣ted before suche a iudge / so craftie / so captious / so malicyous / and replete with all enuy. It is sayd that from the house of An∣nas vnto Cayphas house were an hundreth neynty & .iiii. passes by the whiche space about .xxx. tymes they condemned hym / and spued or spyt vpon hym / bisydes many other tormētes & paynes. ¶Here folowe .ii. lesson. OF this article we may note .ii. lessons. The firste that the seruantes of god shuld not be moche afrayd to be presented before euyll and wicked iudges. For the more wicked the iudge is / the more grace therby commeth to the seruauntes of god. Ex¦emples herof we haue in the glorious apostles Peter and Poule whiche suffred deth vnder the moste cruell Iudge Nero. Also in saynte Laurence / whiche by the moste wycked tyraunt Decyus was put to deth, and so of many other holy sayntes. The se∣cond lesson is this / that we shulde depely remember al our euyll{is} that we haue done / and so present our conscyence before the hye Iudge Christ / and also before his vycar here in erth our curate to be duely examyned / for our sauyour Christe disdeyned not to be examined before the pryncys of the preestes / the scribes & the seniours of the Iues. And pray as foloweth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu which for me most vnkynd wretch wold be sent from Annas vnto Caiphas & also wold be examined before hym graunt to me I beseche the for ye loue of thy name that I feare not the iudgement of euyll persones / and also that I may appere in thy syght with a good and pure conscience. Amen.
¶Of the bryngynge furth of false testimonie agaynst Christe. The .xiii. article. THe .xiii. article is of the saynges of .ii. fals witnesses. For whan Christe stode before Caiphas the hyghe prince of prestes, and all the counsaile there gathered dyd serche to haue false testimony against Iesus that by some colour they myght put hym to death, and yet they coulde fynde none conuenient wytnes, thoughe many false witneshes were brought forth,Libro. xiii. then at laste there came two false witneshes / of the whiche Symon de cassia sayth: The counsell of the Iues saughte for testimonie agaynst Chryst that vnder the colour of iustyce they myght put hym to deth, whome they persu∣ed of pure enuy / but they laboured to cloke the crueltye and enuy of theyr myndes with ye cloke of iustyce / and therfore they saught for false witnes. And here note that it is to the hyghe laude and prayse of Christ that they could not fynd the leste thynge that he was culpable in / or to be reproued / and note wele that it is wry∣ten: Falsum testimonium. They saughte for false testimonie for they myght neuer fynde true wytnesse agaynst hym.Marci. 14. F. But at last two false wytnes came furth and sayd: we herd hym say, I may distroy this temple of god that is here made & in .iii. dayes buyld an other temple. By this testimonie they intended to proue that Christ wolde vsurpe vnto hym the power of god as if he were god / but these two were false witneshes for they chaunged the wordes of Christe and also his sense and vnderstandynge. The wordes of Christe were these:Iohn̄. 2. D. Soluite templum hoc: et in tribus diebus excitabo illud /  That is / dissolue this temple (that is kyll or sley this bodye of myne) and in thre dayes I shall rayse it vp agayne. He ment of the temple of his body and they spake of the material temple in Hierusalem / and therfore they added in theyr testimony: Templum hoc manufactum: This temple made by the hand of man / whiche wordes Christ spake not / and therfore they bare false witneshe agaynst hym / and that dyd not a lytell hurte or greue Christ.Psal. Cxv. What man is he that wyl not be sory to be falsly accused / though he (as euery man is) be mutable and many thyn¦ges do offende? Howe moche more then shulde Christe be sorye to be falsly accused / syth he in nothynge can offende, for he is the essencyal treuth of god and the selfe god in substance. Here saint Anselme in his boke called Cur deus homo / merueylynge of the mischeuouse mynde that the Iues had, so to procure the death of
Christ: answereh to hym selfe instructe by the spirite of god / and sayth: I thynke that there is none other cause of theyr malyce to∣wardes Christe, but that he continually and stably keapt truthe and iustyce both in his dayly speache / in his teachynge and also in his lyuynge. And contrary wyse / the Iues were euell / false / vn¦iuste and craftye or disceytefull, for the whiche Christe sharplye rebuked them, and therfore they procured his deth for they wold haue none to lyue that shulde be better than they: lesse that they shulde then be reputed as synfull men / and so suffer great shame and rebuke. This counsel was spoken of by the holy patriarche Iacob sainge:Genes. 49. A. Simeon et Leui fratres: vasa iniquitatis bellantia. &c. Symeon and Leny brretherne / armed or feyghtynge vesselles of iniquitie, I wolde that my soule or lyfe came not in to theyr handes / power or counsell. And of this text the ordinerye glose sayth / that the bysshoppes & preestes were of the tribue or stocke of Leni, and the scribes for the more partie were of the stocke of Symeon. ¶Here folowe a lesson. OF this article we may take this doctrine, that we shulde hate and abhorre all false testimony / also all falsnesse and lyes / for Christe / by false testimonye and by lyes was con¦dempned to deth, and as ofte as we speake false witnes agaynst our neyghbour we condempne Christe vnto the death / asmoche as is in vs.Libro. iii. And howe abhominable this synne is: Isydore in his boke De summo bono sheweth saynge:Capi. lix. He that beareth false witnes: offendeth agaynst thre persons, that is agaynste god, whome he contemneth by his swearynge and breakynge of his commaundement. Also agaynst the iudge, whome by his lyeng he disceyueth. And thyrdly agaynst the innocent, whom he hur∣teth by his false testimonie. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde for me be blamed of the Iues / and by theyr false testimonie accused: graunt to me that I neuer blame or rebuke man for the, nor falsely that I accuse any person and also that I pacyently suffer all false accusacyons for thy ho∣nour and glorye. Amen. ¶Of the blasphemy imputed to Christe. The .xiiii. article.
THe .xiiii. article is the false imposicyon of blasphemy vnto Christe. Cayphas the cheyfe prynce of the preest{is} and the highe bysshop for that yere, seyng that Christ wold not speake or answere to theyr false accusacyons And that suche testimonies as was spoken agaynste hym / were not sufficyent for his condempnacyon: He was gretly troubled bycause I say he coulde fynde no cause wherin he myghte accuse hym & iustly condempne hym, and then he so kyndled with wroth in a great furye of mynd he arose vp with great inpacyence from his seate of dignitie and sayd vnto Iesus:Math. 26. F. Nihil respondes ad ea¦que isti aduersum te testificātur? Wyl thou not answere vnto such causes as these persons lay agaynst the? By the inordinate mo∣uynge of his bodye he made knowen the furye of his mynde / as Bede sayth where as temperance and grauitye beseameth a pre∣late and a iudge both in his wordes / dedes and gesture.Su{per} Mat. 15. And as Symon de Cassia saythe:Libro. 13. Cayphas rose vp for vnquyetenes of mynde and so by his cruell mynde he was made higher then hym selfe / for a man standynge is hygher than whan he is syttyng, he prouoked Christ to answere / nor for the intent that he wolde be∣leaue his answere or take his excuse: but hearynge his answere he myght peruert it and take therof occasyon to accuse hym, but Iesus wold not answere / he held his speach meakly / for he knewe that Cayphas wolde take summe occasion of his answere / wher∣by he wold accuse hym, therfore Iesus wold not speake, & that was not of any displeasure or feare: but for a misterie, as kno∣wynge that he whiche moued hym to speake: dyd it of a crafte and fraude, and not to knowe the truthe. Also he kepte silence to gyue vs example to contempne the false craftes and disceytes of our aduersaries / and therfore he wolde rather strongly keape his silence than to defende his cause without ony profyte. And of this silence was spoken longe before that tyme, by the prophet Esay:Esaie. 53. C Quasi agnus coram tondente se obmutescet. &c. He shalbe as dumbe as a lambe whan he is shorne / and he shal not open his mouth to gyue answere.Psal. 37. And the prophet Dauid saith in the per¦son of Christ: I as a deafe man hard not: & I was as a dumbe man not openynge his mouth. And the more that our sauyoure Iesus kepte silence to them that were not worthy his answere: the more Cayphas the bisshop beynge in greate furye / prouoked Christe to answere.Math. 26. F. And therfore with great indignacyon and inpacyence he said to Christ Adiuro te per deum viuum vt dicas no bis si tu es Christus filius dei: I adiure the by the lyuynge god /
or charge and commaunde the by the vertue of the lyuynge god / that thou say vnto vs if thou be Christ the sonne of god lyuynge. This adiuracyon Cayphas spake of a false craftie and disceytful mynde and not for to knowe the truthe.Su{per} Mat. 26. And therfore saynt Hie∣rom sayth: Cayphas dyd adiure Christ by the lyuynge god, that for the reuerence of the name of god: he shulde answere and speke vnto them not intendyng therby to knowe the truth, but to take occasion of his wordes to falsly accuse Christe. O what madnes and wickednes was this, fyrst they sent to take hym and so they bounde hym as a thefe worthy deth. And now they examyn hym not to knowe the truth / but rather to fynd some occasion in hym wherby they myghte accuse hym vnto Pylate as worthy death. And this adiuracyon was a greuous synne in Caiphas, for it per¦teyneth not to the inferiour so to coniure the superiour without a reasonable cause / to say the treuthe. This notwithstandynge Christe for the reuerence of the name of god wherwith he was adiured: he answered and spake the truth fyrste that they shulde not excuse theym selfe but that they herde hym saye the treuth, and also that he wolde not be noted to contēpne the name of god, for these causes Iesus answered & sayde:Math. 26. F. Tu dixisti, ego sum. &c. Thou hast sayd the truthe, I am the sonne of god notwithstan∣dynge,Marci. 14. G. I say vnto you that from hensforth or herafter ye shall se the sonne of man, that is, ye shall se me, whome you nowe con∣tempne and shamefully entreate, syt on the ryght hand of the ver∣tue of god, that is in maiestie and power equall / and one with god the father and ye shall se me cume at the day of iudgement in my manhode with great power and maiestie in the clowdes of heuen.Su{per} Mar. Than Cayphas whiche before rose vp in a greate furye hearynge this answere was more mad,Libro. iiii. and so cut or rent his gar¦mentes,Libro. 13. for as Bede sayth whome that furie made ryse from his seate: this madnes prouoked hym to cut and rent his vestiment. and as Symon de Cassia sayth, this cuttynge of his garment doth shewe a folysshe diuisyon in his maners / and also the want of the bond of Charitie. And in this acte Cayphas dyd also pro∣phicye / shewynge and signifyenge by the cuttynge of his gar∣ment, that the Iues shuld shortly lese theyr dignitye of preesthod which began in Aaron, for when he cut his garment or clothyng he made that openly to be sene, which before was secreat, and so consequently he cut and put from hym the couerynge of the lawe, though he knewe it not: nor yet intended yt, for he onely cut his clothynge: that he mygh: make his accusacyon agaynst Christe,
more greuous, and to shewe that thynge by his doynge: which he spake in his wordes, for he sayde that Christe dyd blaspheme god. It was a custome and a maner amonges the Iues yt whan they herde any blasphemye spoken agaynst god: they wolde cut and rent theyr clothynge or garmentes in token of sorowe and de¦testacyon of so great a cryme. This greuous synne of blasphemy the prynce of preestes Cayphas dyd impute to Christe saynge: Blasphemauit: He hathe blasphemed god attributynge and gy∣uynge that thynge to hym selfe: whiche is onely propre to god. What nede we of ony other witnes as he myght say we labour in vayne to searche for wytnesse agaynste hym, for he hath spoken openly and before al your presence, ye haue hard hym speake blas¦phemye. O wreche and prynce full of wyckednesse, he spake no blasphemye but the treuth thou dost blaspheme the sonne of god, for thou wyll not gyfe that thynge to god that apperteynethe to god, thou reputest the essencyall sonne of god to be a pure crea∣ture, and therfore thy blasphemye shalbe with the euermore to thy eternall perdicyon and dampnacyon. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson, that we shulde be pure and clene from all blasphemye both in our selfe and al∣so to other persons, in our selfes: that we nother do nor say any thynge wherby the name of god shuld be blasphemed in vs or by vs. And also that we moue not ony other persons to blaspheme god. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article let hym in a contrarie maner blysse or prayse god in this or lyke maner. Sit nomen domini benedictum. &c. Blessed be the name of god nowe and euer. Amen. And also pray as foloweth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche dyd suffer the abhominable synne of blasphe∣my to be put vpon the: kepe me that thy name be neuer blas¦phemed by me in worde nor in dede / and that neuer ony blasphe∣mie / or ony other euyl word be spoken or vttered with my mouth. ¶Of the Condempnacyon of Christe. The .xv. article. THe .xv. article is the condempnacyon of Christe vnto the death. Whan Cayphas the prynce of preestes had sayde to his compaigney that were there gathered in counsel, ye all haue nowe herd hym speake blasphemy, he asked of them what they thought, and then they al answering
sayd:Math. 10. G. Reus est mortis: He is worthy death / he hath deserued deth. This they sayd that theyr malice shuld be openly knowen, and though they dyd not so intende: yet it was so done by the permis∣syon and suffrance of god, as many other thynges here spoken and done in these articles.Libro. . And beholde here (sayth Symon de Cassia) howe iustyce is oppressed / vertu put vnder foote / and reason vtterly subdued to theyr malice, in so moche that all the princes / wyse men and seniours dyd agre in one sentence to con∣demne to deth the rightuous person. And there was not one that wolde speake for the innocent / that wolde defende hym / excuse hym / or requyre respyt of that he myght answere or defend hym selfe / but all they condempned hym as worthy deth / where as Christe spake onely the treuth.Marci. 14. G. And note here the merueylouse folysshenes or rather madnes of this bisshop / howe he syttynge in the place of a iudge / dyd peruerte the ordre of iustyce and of the lawe. Fyrst he gaue sentence of blasphemy agaynst Christe / and after that he asked counsell of suche as satte in examinacyon with hym sayeng what thynke you in this cause, and they sayd: Reus est mortis: He is worthy death. Suche a iudge hath suche coun∣sellers, they were the accusers of Christe, they discussed and exa¦mined his cause and they also gaue sentence and all contrarie to the order of the lawe. They sayd he is gyltye and worthy death. It Christ had blasphemed as they said that he dyd:Leui. 24. C. they had then sayd treuthe, for who so euer dyd blaspheme the name of god, by the lawe he shulde suffer death, for he shulde be stoned to death. But for asmoche as Christe dyd not so in dede as they sayd: ther¦fore theyr sentence was false and wycked. And therfore this con∣dempnacion of Christ vnto the death: is conueniently nombred amonges the articles of Christes passyon, for what man is there that wyll not be heuy and sory to be falsly condēpned vnto deth, how moche then shulde Christe be sory beynge moste innocent, and the lyfe of all lyuynge creatures, to be condempned vnto so shameful a death of the crosse / and that by those persons: whome he came to saue and helpe. ¶Here folowe, ii. lessons. OF this article we may take .ii. lessons. Fyrst that this voyce of the Iues: Reus est mortis: He is worthy death / whiche was spoken of Christ most innocent, that this voyce (I say) ne∣uer rest or be founde in our hertes and mouthes. Nor that it at ony tyme be truely veryfyed in vs: as it may be of euery persone
that committeth deedly synne, for of euery suche person it maye be truly spoken: He is worthy death, The seconde is that if at any tyme we be persued and also condempned to the deth falsely innocently or without iustyce / and for the name of Christe: that we be not troubled / but rather glad and ioyefull remembrynge (as Christ sayth) that our reward shalbe great and plentuous in heuen / if we here paciently suffer for Christe / and than pray as foloweth or in lyke maner.Math. 5. B ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche feared not the Wycked voyce of the most cru∣ell Iues when they sayd of the: Reus est mortis: He is wor¦thy deth, and pacyently dyd suffer the same for me most wretche: kepe and preserue me / that I neuer be founde worthye eternall deth in thy syght. Amen. ¶Of the buffetynge or smytyng in the necke of Christ. The .xvi. article. THe .xvi. article is the beatynge or smytynge of christ in the necke with theyr fystes / for whan Iesus hadde confessed hym selfe to be the sonne of god / whiche the Iues toke for the most blasphemy that might be: then all the compeyney that were present fel vpon hym lyke mad men rebukynge and mockynge hym / some dyd spytte in his face and some dyd smyte hym in the necke with theyr fystes as saynt Ma∣thewe sayth:Math. 26. G. Comonly suche persones as be taken for foolys or vyle persons and dispysed be so smyten in the necke. Therfore in that / that the Iues bet Christ with theyr fystes in the necke there is not so moche intended in this article / the payne that then he suffred, as the cōtumely and dispisynge, for that, they that tyme reputed hym as a foole and a vyle person, for therby he was moc¦ked / scorned and blasphemed / and therfore they also pinched / nip¦ped him and pulled hym by the chekes & by the heyre of his berde, whiche all he suffred pacyently / and so was fulfylled the sayenge of the prophyt whiche sayd in the person of Christ:Esaie. l. C. Corpus meum dedi percutientibus: et genas meas vellentibus: I offer my body pacyently to them that smote it / and my chekes to them that pyn¦ched them. And these laste wordes some men expounde them / of the rentynge and tearynge of Christes chekes with the sharpe nayles of the most cruell Iues,Lira super. and some doctours declare them of the pullynge of Christes heyre out from his berde,Esa. l. capi. & whether
of these be true or that both be true (whiche I rather suppose) I may well se and {per}ceyue that the cursed handes of the most cruell Iues were not saciate with smytyng / beatyng & spyttyng in that most swete face of our sauiour Iesu, but also they rent his beau∣tious face with theyr nayles & pluckyng out the heyre frome hys berde,Libro. xiii. and as Symon de Cassia saith: This smytyng in ye neck may signifye vnder a misterie the obstinate malice of the Iues, wherby they cōtinually curse our fayth / whiche ioyneth vs vnto god, and also it signifieth the crueltie of the paganes which cōti¦nually labored by theyr tyrannie to distroy & cut away our fayth. For the pagans before yt they were cōuerted to the faith: they put to deth as many faythfull people as they might get. Colaphus is properly called a beetyng in the necke with ye fyst. Nowe spūally our faith is called the necke of the church for asmoch as it ioyneth the hed & the body togyther that is: christians be ioyned to christ by fayth / and this faith shulde be strong as the necke / and therfore in the canticles it is compared to the towre of Dauid which was very stronge.Cant. 4. G. Our sauiour Iesus was smyten in the necke .xl. tymes in the house of Cayphas, and there were gathered in this counsell of the Iues agaynste Christe. lxxvii. Iues. ¶A Lesson. IN this article we may take this lesson / that we be well ware that we neuer beate Christ in the necke: as saynte Bede sayth:Su{per} Mar. cap. 14. All false christians that confesse Christe in worde and denye hym in theyr lyuyng: they beat Christ in the necke / for Colaphus is that stroke that is gyuen byhynde a man. They also do beate Christe in the necke: that prefer theyr owne honor and glorie before the glory of Christe. And also they that sclaunder theyr neyghbour byhynde his backe. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article he may gyue hym selfe a clap in the necke / in the remembraunce of all Christes strokes, and then praye thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde be smytten by the cruell Iues in the necke for my loue: graunt to me that I may so confesse the my lorde god with my mouthe: that I neuer do contrarye thy preceptes in my dedes. Amen.
¶Of the spittyng in Christes face. The .xvii. article. THe .xvii. article is of ye spittyng in Christ{is} face, whan al the Iues had accused Christ as worthy to dye / then they dyd spytte in his face / as in a persone most vyle / abiecte and to be dispysed / a person cursed and repro∣ued of god,Mat. 15. G and therfore as the gospell sayth: Ceperunt quidam conspuere eum: Some be ganne to spytte vpon hym / and that in his most amiable face as Mathewe sayth:Mat. 26. G. This spyttynge was done and suffred of Christe for many causes. Fyrst to note theyr great vnkyndnes:Libro. xiii. as Symon de Cassia saythe: Our lorde dyd spytte on the erth and made clay / and therwith anoynted the eyen of hym that was borne blynde & so gaue to hym hys syght / which he had not by nature.Ioh. 9. A. And nowe the Iues to shewe theyr vnkynd¦nesse / dyd defoyle the face of our lorde with theyr soule spyttyn∣ges. Secondely they spyte in his face to his great shame and des¦pection, for it was the propertie of the Iues to spytte in the face of hym whom they dispysed and reputed as a vyle and abiect per¦sone. O abhominable maner of the Iues whiche abhorred not to defoyle that most amiable and louly face / the whiche angelles haue great desyre to beholde whichens ful of grace & fauour and desired of all good people for it is ye lyfe conforth & helth of al yt be holdeth it / & not only they dyd spyt in his face / but also they coght and retched & so cast ye foule stynkyng flegme into his fayre face. Therfore Mathew saith: Expuerūt, that is / they retching & cou∣ghyng / dyd spyt it into his face. And Marchus saith Conspuerūt: that is not only one {per}son but many togither dyd spue in his face, in somoch that yt most blessed & amiable face was made so abhomi¦nable to behold as if it had ben full of lepre / and yt was thorough theyr spittyng{is} / scratchyng{is} & betayng{is}▪ as we shall declare in the next article. And so was fulfylled in christ ye {pro}phecie of Esay sa∣yng of christ:Esa. liii. A. Non erat ei species. &c. There was nother beautye nor fauour in his face, we se him & we might not se his face it was so couered wt blode & spyttyng{is}, we reputed hym as a lepre and smyten of god as ye most wretched / but he was woūded for our ini¦quites & oppressed for our sinnes & not for his owne. And herunto saint Barnard saith.In semōe de passione domini. O good Iesu these moste wretched & cruell Iues haue wt theyr stynkyng spuyng{is} defoyled thy face so beau∣tious & amiable yt angelles desire to behold it which fulfylleth all heuyns wt ioye & gladnes / which both rich & pore in ye worlde do worship / & yet good lord thy wretched creatours dyd smyte ye and dispise ye as a vyle seruant / thou beyng the lorde of all creatours.
¶Here foloweth a lesson. OF this article we may take this doctrine, that we oughte diligently to be warre that we neuer spytte in the face of god as the Iues dyd, which we do when we defoyle our soule & cōscyence with ony fylthy thoughtes or dedes, for Christ doth rest in the soule and conscience in the whiche his face or yma¦ge is hole and perfyt. And therfore who so euer defoyleth his con¦science with deedly synne: he spytteth in the face of Christ, saint Hierom sayth that our lorde Iesus wolde suffer pacyently suche spyttynges in his face:Su{per} Ma. 14. that therby he myght wasshe our conscy∣ence whiche is as the face of our soule. And that a man myghte conforme hym selfe to this article, he shulde forme and ymagyne in his mynde: Christe horribly in his face deformed and defoyled with the spyttynges of the Iues, and then he shulde thanke hym with all his herte for his great pacyence, and so glorifye Christ for that rebuke and shame. Also we shulde remember howe ofte we haue defoyled the most beautifull face of Christ in our conscy¦ence by mortall synne. Also howe oftentymes we haue receyued vnworthelye the blessed bodye of our lorde and defoyled it with our fylthy spotyll, and then praye thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde suffer thy most fayre and amyable face to be defoyled for my loue wich the fylthy spyttynges of the Iues: graunt to me that I neuer defyle the face of thy ymage in my soule / by my synfull actes or fylthy cogitacyons. Amen. ¶Of the smytynge of Christe in the face. The .xviii. article. THe .xviii. article is the smytynge of Christe in the face. Of the whiche saynte Mathewe sayth thus: Et palmes ei in faciem dederūt,Math. 26. G. And they smote hym in the face with the palme of theyr handes, as the hande whan it is closed it is called the fyste / so whan it is open and spredde abrode it is called the palme.Isydorus. As papias and Isydore saythe.Libro. xi. So nowe they smote Christe with theyr open handes vppon the face.Ethicorum cap. 14. And this smytynge maketh a specyall article of the passyone of Chryste / for asmoche as a manne dothe suffer more payne by suche smytynge in the face:Papias su∣per hāc dic∣tionem pal¦ma.
then by smytynge in the necke, for in the face of man ar all ye sen∣ces or wittes, and also the face is moche tener and soone hurte. And therfore it is very lyke that by suche swytynge in the face the blode ranne out from his noose and also from his mouth though it be not writen by the euangelistes.Libro. xiii. For as Symon de Cassya sayth: That the euangelistes dyd omitte many thynges decla∣rynge the bytternes of Christes passyon, whiche yet we meakly beleue, and that was bycause the euangelistes wrote onely for the truthe of the historie to be had / and not pryncypally to excite and moue the effecte of compassyon in vs. O what enorme and greuous synne of the most wicked Iues was this, yt they wolde so cruelly smyte so pleasaunt a face?Sn{per} marc. 14. in fine. But as saynt Hierom saith: He wolde pacyently suffer so to be smyten with theyr palmes: that we with our handes and lyppes, that is with our workes and wordes myght laude and prayse hym. Also we may say that he is smytten in the face: whiche is rebuked and reuyled to his owne face. And in this maner also was Christ smyten in the face for he suffred many rebukes / contumelies and dispysynges open¦ly to his owne face spoken.Esaie. l. C. And of the prophet Esay in the person of Christe / Faciem meam non auerti▪ ab increpantibus et conspuen∣tibus in me. I haue not turned my face frome theym that reuyled and rebuked me and spytted vpon me, for the Iues dyd not on∣lye smyte Christ vpon the face: but also they reuyled hym to hys face with many opprobrious and blasphemous wordes, which all the euangelistes do not expresse. But yet Lucas touchethe them in a generaltie sayenge:Luc. 22. G. Et multa alia blasphemantes: dice∣bant in eum: The Iues blasphemyng Christ: spake many other opprobrious wordes to hym. ¶Here foloweth .ii. lessons. THe firste lesson is that we shuld be ware that we smyte not Christe in the face with our palmes, He smyteth Christe in the face with his palme (as saynte Austen sayeth: Whiche doethe hurtte and offende the inte∣gryty and the perfeccyon of the ymage of god in his soule, and therfore a man fallynge from grace by mortall synne doth smyte Christe (as it were) in the face with his hande and euyll worke, for therby he offendeth and hurteth ye integritie & {per}feccyon of the image of god in his soule. The .ii. is / as christ our god dyd neuer
auerte and turne away his face from such rebukes / blasphemies dispysynges / persecucyons and spyttynges, but rather gladlye and pacyently dyd offer his face to them for our loue: so shulde we in tyme conuenient not refuse / but rather gladlye suffer lyke thynges for the loue of Christe. And then let vs worshyppe hym and pray we as foloweth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde suffer for my loue thy most louely face to be smyten with the handes of the moste wycked Iues: graunt to me that I may euer kepe the face of thyne ymage pure and vndefoyled in my soule / that it neuer be spotted or hurte by the synfull handes and workes of my iniquityes or sinnes. Amē. ¶Of the couerynge and blyndfyldynge of Christes face. The .xix. article, THe .xix.Marc. 14. G. article is the couerynge of Christes face / for as the Gospel saith: Velauerunt faciem eius: They couered his face, who so euer couereth the face of an other person: he hydeth that face from hym, and so the Iues hydd the face of god from them. And this couerynge yet continueth vnto this daye vpon the hertes of the Iues / for they wyll not se and knowe god as they shulde do. O mad blyndnes and blynde madnes of these vnhappy Iues, that most pleasaunt face whiche the holye patriarches and prophetys and theyr formar fathers greatly desyred to come and with conty¦nuall and longe syghenges desyred to se it, but these wycked Iu¦es / when they had it present and myght haue sene it / they wolde not, but couered it and hyde it from them. Moyses desyred to se this face whan he sayd:Exod. 33. C. Ostende mihi faciem tuam: Lorde shewe to me thy face, Also Dauid sayd: shewe to vs thy face and we / shalbe safe.Cant. 2. D. Psal. lxxix. Also in the canticles it is writen / shewe to me thy face for it is very fayre.Psal. lxxix. All the fathers also in Limbo patrum dyd crye and say: Come and shewe to vs thy face lorde that syttest aboue Cherubyn. And at laste: He that was thus desyred of all good men: came and shewed his face to the Iues, and they as most wretched couered his face,Su{per}. Mar. 14. not for that he shuld not se theyr synnes but to hyde hys face from them selfe as Bede sayethe:Exo. 34. D. for theyr soore and blynde ey ene myghte not beholde the face of Moyses: Excepte that it were fyrste couered, but this person Chryste is moche more of dignity then Moyses.
And therfore his face is moche more glorious and shinynge then Moyses face was, though Christes glory were al inwardly and outwardly couered with a clowde of a mortall bodye / yet there was a lytyll sparke of glorye shynynge in his face, that dyd so glymer and beat in the eyes of the Iues: that they could or wold not pacyently beholde his face / but couered it and hydd it from them selfe, signifyenge therby (though they so dyd not intende) that no infidele and synfull person turned from god: myghte se and beholde the face of Christe, for it is hyd from them, A figure of this couerynge and blyndfyldyng we may take in Sampson which for the loue he had vnto the synful woman Dalida:Iudi. 16. E. F. he lost his strength / he was taken of his enemyes / his eyen were putte out / and also he was fatigate and weryed with manifolde illusy∣ons and scornes. So our stronge Sampson Christ Iesus was serued in lyke maner as it appereth in the articles of his passyon, and al that was for ye loue of our synfull soule, to whom he spake by the prophet,Hie. 3. A. Thou hast done fornicacyon with many straūge louers, yet returne & come agayne to me and I shal receyue the. ¶A lesson. OF this article we may lerne this lesson that we ought to be wele ware that we neuer blyndfylde Christe or couer his face. But alas many Christyans nowe a dayes do couer Christ{is} face, whiche do synne priuily / thynkynge that god doth not se them. Also they do couer Christes face whiche seeth all thynges that do chaunge / gyue or sell craftelye / that thynge whiche ys e∣uyll or nought: for a good thynge. Also they couer Christes face which do derke or couer the Image of god in theyr soules with the cloke of wylfull ignorans or synne. And therfore saynte Hie∣rom sayth,Su{per} Ma. 14. that Christ wold haue his face couered, bycause that he wolde take awaye the couer and cloke of ignorance and synne from our hertes. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche dyd suffer for my loue thy most gracyous face (the whiche angelles desyre to behold) to be couered of the wicked Iues to thy great rebuke: I beseche the make thy face to shyne vpon me thy most wretched seruant / that thy godly ymage in me be neuer derked or couered and that mercyfully thou wold take away the cloke of synne and the derknes of ignorance from my herte with the lyghte of thy heuenlye grace. Amen.
¶Of the mockynge of Christ when they bad hym prophicye, who is this that smy∣teth the. The .xx. article. THe .xx. article is the scornful questyon of the Iues vnto Christ, For when they had couered his face: they smote hym on the heed saynge: Arede or prophicye vnto vs Christe, who is he that smyteth the nowe. But in what parte they then dyd smyte hym: the euangelistes spake diuersly. For Marcus sayth that then they smote hym with theyr fystes in the necke.Math. 20. G. But Mathew and Luke say that they smote hym vp∣pon the face wyth the palmes of theyr handes.Luce. 22. G Therfore we may say cōueniently, that after they had couered his face: euery man smote hym as he wold, and so some smote hym in the necke / some in the face and some on the chekes: and so smytynge they sayde. Arede or prophicye to vs thou Christ / who smote the nowe?Math. 26. G. And this they spake to mocke and scorne hym as the glose sayth,Glosa ordi¦naria Ibid by∣cause he wolde be taken as a prophet amonge his apostles and comen people, and whom the people also toke for a great prophet But the Iues nowe bycause he wolde not saye who smote hym: they toke hym for a false prophet. Our sauyour Iesus wolde not answere to theyr folisshe and mad questyon / bycause he knewe that they mocked hym, and so surely it had ben but a folysshenes to answere vnto theyr madnes. Saynt Hierom sayth: that they ware without mercy and full of crueltie / and therfore they dyd all the euyll and derysyon that they coulde do to hym. Some smote hym of an euyll frowarde wyl, and some to please ye great prynces, whiche were moste cruell and full of malice. And as saynt Hierome saith: this payne and passyon that he suffred that nyght: shall neuer be manyfestly & hollye knowen vnto ye day of iudgemēt, for frō the beginnyng of the nyght vnto the mornyng, he was left in the handes & custody of the vyle seruantes whiche dyd then exercyse and proue in hym all maner of tormentes and paynes that they coulde ymagyne: Nowe drawynge hym by the heyre of the heed nowe smytyng hym on the face, nowe spyttyng in his face and mouthe, nowe pynchynge his chekes and so of o∣ther paynes as we sayd before and shall say more hereafter: they vexed and greued our sauyour Christe both in soule and in body. ¶Of the Compassyon of oure Ladye.
BVt where art thou nowe O thou blessed virgyn Ma∣rie mother of Christ? Doyst not thou knowe nowe what thynges be done aboute thy dearbeloued sonne Iesus? Some do say that Iohan the Euangeliste, leauynge Christ in the house of Cayphas / ranne to Bethanie to the house of Marie Magdalen where as our lady remaned when Iesus went with his disciples to Hierusalem to make his supper and to eat the paschal lambe, and whan Iohan was come to bethany he knocked and rapt vpon the dore / and the blessed virgyn beynge in hyr prayers / hearynge hym was great∣ly astonisshed and called vnto Magdalene and sayde: Aryse my doughter and know what is become of my sonne. Anon the dore was opened and Iohan came in cryenge / wepynge and saynge / Alas reuerent mother, I brynge heuy tythynges to the / and for sobbynge and wepynge he coulde scarsely speake, then the vyr∣gyn with great heuynes & also weapyng asked of Iohan, where is my sonne: where is my Iesus: what is done with hym? is he yet on lyue or the most cruell Iues hath slayne hym? and Iohan as he myght speake sayd: He is yet lyuynge / but as I can per∣ceyue: they wyll this day put hym to death. The ministers and the Iues toke hym this nyght / and nowe they kepe hym faste bound in the house of Cayphas / and those wicked scrybes and phariseys do say that he ought to be iudged to deathe. O howe colde then was the vyrgins hert, with howe moche sorowe was she then replete? And then furth with she wente with Iohan has∣tely to Hierusalem, and Magdalene with other diuers women went with her / and whan she came in to the citye she saughte her sonne by the brode stretes and narrowe laynes / askynge of them she met, where is my dearbeloued sonne / and so forthe as ye shal se in the next article, and also in the .xliiii. and .lviii. articles. ¶A deuout Contemplacyon for a lesson. FOr an holsom lesson in this article we shall set before you a breue contemplacyon of the most shamful moc¦kinges and derisions that the Iues dyd vnto ye most innocent lambe our sauyour Iesus. O my deuoute soule / awayke / ryse and depely consider howe thy sa¦uyour Iesus whiche is the soueraigne lorde & glorye of angelles is nowe made the mockynge stocke of the Iues, and as it were a tenyse ball of derysyon wherwith the preestes and the scribes
and phariseys done play togyther castynge and sendynge hym from one to an other to his greate rebuke and heuynes. As An∣nas sent hym to Cayphas, Cayphas to Pylate, Pylate to He∣rode and Herode to Pylate agayne. And in all these places and in goynge also thyther he suffred many dispytes and greuous paynes / as we sayde before and shall say more herafter. Of this the prophete Dauid speaketh in the persone of Christe sayenge: Omnes videntes me deriserunt me:Psal. 21. All that se me dyd mocke me, and that .iii. maner of wayes, with-false wordes, with signes and with scornefull sentences. Of the fyrste the prophet sayth: Lo cuti sunt labiis: They haue spoken with theyr lyppes / withoute good consideracyon or aduysement. Nowe false thynges impu∣tynge to me and somtyme makynge false promyses to me. For the firste they sayd:Math. 27. E. Alios saluos fecit: seipsum non potest sa luum fa cere He made other safe / but he can not saue hym selfe. Here they imputed a false thynge to hym / that he coulde not saue hym selfe, and that is false. Also they made to hym a false promisse whan they sayd.Ibidem. Si rex Israel est: descenda hunc de cru et credimus ei. If Christe be the kynge of Israell let hym discende nowe & come downe from the crosse and we wyll beleue to hym. There was a false promisse for they thought not as they sayd. The second de∣risyon was with signes.Psal. 21. And of this also speaketh Dauid: Et mouerunt capita sua / They dyd moue and shake theyr heedes at hym.Mat. 27. G And so saith Mathewe: Preteeunt autem blasphemabat eum mouentes capita sua. &c. They that passed by the mount of Caluarie where as Christe was crucifyed dyd blaspheme hym / mouynge theyr heedes and sayenge (Hoy) This is he that wyl distroy the temple of god and in .iii. dayes buyld it agayne. The thyrde derisyon was with scornefull and mockynge or ironyous sentences.Psal. 21. And of this it foloweth in Dauid: Sperauit in domino eripiat eum. &c. He trusted in god the father, let hym nowe dely∣uer hym from our handes, let hym saue Christe / by reysyng hym agayne. For as Christ saith▪ His father loueth hym & wyll saue hym.Mat. 27. G On this maner the Iues sayd: Confidit in deum: liberet nunc eum si vult: dixit enim, filius dei ego sum▪ Christ trusteth in to god the father, let hym delyuer hym nowe if he may and wyll, for he said that he was the sonne of god. Thus they mocked hym also they couered his face and smote hym with other thynges as we sayd before. Also of these thynges the prophet Dauid speketh in an other psalme in the persone of Christe: Confortati sunt qui persecuti sunt me inimici mei iniuste. &c. My enemyes that haue
persecuted me wrongfully haue nowe the hygher hande and do∣minyon ouerme / and therfore I nowe paye and suffer paynes for that thynge whiche I had not. Adam and Eue dyd eate the apple: but nowe I paye for it and suffer payne for theyr synne. And that a man might conforme hym self to this article: let hym remember what irrisyon and shame Christe suffred in this acte / and howe the Iues made hym theyr laughynge and mockynge stocke: and as it were a chylderne game at hym / and then praye as foloweth / or in any lyke maner. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche with scornefull mockes of the Iues was smy¦ten vpon the heed and bydden to arede and prophycye who smote the: I beseche the good Iesu prophicye and shewe to me, that I myght knowe what a wreche and synner I am, whiche so ofte (alas for sorowe) haue smytten the with the hand of myne euyll and synfull dedes. Amen. ¶Howe Christe was presented before Pylate. The xxi. article. THe .xxi. article is the presentacyon of Christe before Py¦late. For what tyme it was clere day / that is the fyrste houre of the day / at .vi. of the clocke at the sonne rysyng. A greate multitude of Iues came to Cayphas house / and from thens they ledde Iesus bounde vnto the mote halle or iudgement house as a mylde lambe that is borne to his deth. O my soule beholde here howe thy sauyour Iesus entreth vnto his iudgement bounde thurst and many other wayes vexed / and all men behelde hym and mockyng hym sayd: O Iesu thou art here nowe, if thou had ben a prophet: thou wolde haue preuyded for this before, with many other lyke wordes that those cursed Iues spake then to hym. And thus they brought hym bounde and dely¦uered hym to ponce Pylate the president and hygh iudge of Iu∣ry vnder the emperoure of Rome.Mat. 17. A This presentynge vnto Py∣late was most greuous of all other vnto Christe, fyrste bycause he was presented before that iudge, whiche had ful power vnder the emperour to condempne hym vnto the deth. Secondly by∣cause the Iues that presented hym to Pylate dyd presente hym / not as to be examyned by Pylate: but they delyuered hym vnto Pylate as conuicte and founde gylty by theyr examinacyon / and so to be put to ye deth without ony other examinacion or taryeng.
For they sayd to Pylate:Ioh. 1. C. If this man were not a mislyuer and so worthy deth / we wolde not haue delyuered hym to the. Of this we shall speake more in the next article. Thyrdly this presentyng to Pylate was moste greuous to Christe bycause he had ben faty gate and weryed the nyght before, many wayes by the crueltye of the Iues, and therfore it was moche more payne to hym now to be brought to the iudgement of a pagane and infidele, for they brought hym bound to Pylate to be slayne and deuoured by hym whiche was reputed as a dogge amonge the Iues bycause he was a gentyle and not circumcysed as they were. ¶A remembraunce of the mornynge of our Ladye. WHen it was publysshed thoroughe out all the cytye of Hierusalem that Iesus was taken, and howe that the Iues wolde crucifye hym: his moste sorowfull mother the virgine Marye herde therof / and so al∣moste deed for sorowe: was led by her systers and o∣ther women with vnspeakeable lamentynges / wepynges / mor∣nynges and syghynges, to se her moste derebeloued sonne, and so wepynge without ceasyng / she sawght hym thorough ye brode stretes and narowe lanes of Hierusalem cryenge / and sayenge: where is my moste derebeloued sonne, where arte thou my most swete Iesu, where shal I fynd the / who hath taken the from me? why may not I dye for the? These word{is} with other lyke might this most sorowefull mother of Iesu say. And whan they came to that place where as they myght se Iesus, they seynge hym so bounde / so tormented / so deformed with theyr spyttynges, forsa¦ken of all his disciples / dispysed / mocked and destitute of all help and solace, so shamfully and paynfully with a greate multitude of armed men cruelly led to the tribunall of the wycked Iudge, and there to be condempned to the death, our ladye with her sys∣ters and the other women I saye seynge and considerynge these thynges: what heuynes / what sorowe and bytternesse were they then fulfylled with: it can not be spoken nor expressed by any sen¦tence. Also our lorde Iesus seynge and knowynge his mother with the other women in so great sorowe: greatly sorowed ther∣of, for without doute he had greate compassyon of them / and so was greatly greued of this compassyon / and most specyally for his most kynd mother, for he knewe that her sorowe was almost
to the deth, as it shall appere in the .lviii. article. And as some doctours say: there were .xl. seruantes that led Christ from Cay¦phas house vnto Pylate besydes the greate multitude of people that went with them: and there were a thousande passes frome Cayphas house vnto the house of Pylate. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson, that the secular po∣wer is not to be dispised but to be honoured. For as saynte Poule sayth:Ro. 13. A. there is no power but of god, and therfore who so resisteth the power: he resisteth the ordinauns of god. And therfore as saynt Austen sayth: Our lorde god stode before Py∣late a gentyle and pagane iudge / and spake neuer one word vn∣reuerently vnto hym. So shulde we with reuerence stand before our prelates and iudges though they be not good: but euyll and vicyous. ¶A prayer. O Lorde Iesu Christe sonne of the lyuynge god, whiche in the firste houre of the day for our helth wolde be presented by the Iues vnto Pylate a pagane iudge: graunte to me for the loue of thy name that I dispyse no maner of power / but that I may gyue due and worthy honoure to my superiours and to all iudges. Amen. ¶Howe the Iues falsely accused Christe before Pylate. The .xxii. article. THe .xxii. article is the false accusacyon that the Iues made of Christe, for whan Christe was brought in to the mote hal and there stode bound before Pylate the iudge: the Iues wolde not come in to the mote hall bycause they wolde not be defoyled and made vnclene, for that day was theyr Pasch day, wherin all the Iues that were clene shulde eate the pure breade that is made of pure where without leuyn, and the Iues had this opinyon, that yf they came in the house of any gentyle or straunger whiche was not circumcided as they were: by that entrance they were made vnclene and so myght not eate of those pure breades: vnto suche tyme they were fyrst purifyed.Su{per} Iohn̄ trac. Cxiiii And here sayth saynt Austen. O wycked blyndnes, the Iues feared to entre the house of a straun∣ger, bycause they wolde not be contaminate / but they feared not to sley theyr innocent brother and also lorde. O thou christiane
note here howe the Iues kepte them selfe frome all vnclennes that they myghte eate the pure breade of wheate whiche gaue to theym no grace of god for the selfe eatynge, moche more then shuldest thou keape thy selfe clenne, whiche receyuest the blessed bodye of Chryste / the heuenlye breade whiche gy∣ueth to the / the eternall lyfe. The Iues wolde not entre in to ye iudgmēt house: and thou wylt not auoyd euyl compaigny and tauernes / where as oftentymes bene spoken temerary vn∣godlye iudgementes,Libro. xiii. and also moche blode shedde by false dexaccyons and other wayes. Symon de Cassia also sayth here: That the Iues of an olde tradycyon and ordynaunce / auoyded and shunned the houses of straungers in suche hyghe solempnytyes. And so they euer intendynge to suche lyghte and vayne ceremonyes and lytyll regardynge greatter thynges: fell in to the deape pytte of greate synnes,Ioh. 18. E. and Pylate seyng that they wolde not enter in to hym: he went forth to them and sayd: what accusacyon brynge you agaynst this man. And here sayth Symon de Cassya:Libro. xiii. It apperteyneth to the wisdome and iustyce of euery iudge and president not to iudge after the mynde of the accusers / excepte theyr accusacyon be probable and true. Ther∣fore Pylate wysely dyd inquyre, and ordinarylye dyd procede in this cause / whan he sayde: what accusacyon shewe yow agaynste this man. For also by the lawes of the Romaynes / no man shulde be condempned to deathe, Excepte he be fyrste accused and that proued, Also Pylate merueylynge and also moued with displeasure agaynste the Iues, that they of theyr owne auctoritye wolde bynde Christe / nor yet conuicte before the iudge: thoughte that they hadde some greate cause agaynst Christe, and therfore he asked of them / what cause they layde agynste hym.Ioh. 18. E. And then they answered: Si non esset hic male∣factor: non tibi tradidissemus eum: If this persone were not a mysordred lyuer: we wolde not haue delyuered hym to the, As if they hadde sayde / after Symon de Cassya we be not mo∣ued of enuye / nor yet styrrede of haytred,Libro. xiii. Nor yet we haue bene hastye in this dede, before that we delyuered hym to the: we dyscussed hys cause, we se his euyll dedes, we knowe his myscheuous tongue / there is nothynge that compellethe vs to delyuer hym vnto the / to be iudged & cōdempned by the: but his euyl dedes. Also addyng this we haue examined him in our wise
and lerned counsell / and there we haue founde hym worthy to dye / wherfore it is not nedeful to haue any further examinacyon. Thus these malicyous Iues dyd iustify them self before the iuge that they myght the more spedely cōdempne the innocent. Pilate sōwhat moued or despleased with theyr answere bicause he knew that they accused Christ for enuy onely that they had to Christe, and therfore thynkyng that they wold not shewe what cause they had against hym: for bycause he had offended against theyr law, therfore I (sayd Pilate) wold not punish him but remitted hym to theyr punisshmēt, which was onely to be beaten & not to inner deth.Ioh. 18. F. And so Pylate sayd to them: Accipite eum vos: et secūdum legem vestram iudicate eum, Take you christ and iudge him after your lawe, as if he shuld say, If your examinacyon be sufficient then iudge you hym and condempne hym for I wyll condempne no man without a cause proued before me. And this also he spake mockynge them,Ibidem. for he knewe well that they myght condempne no man to deth. then the Iues sayd to hym: Nobis non licet in∣terficere quem{quam}: we may sley no man / for that auctoritie was ta¦ken from them by the emperour of Rome. And here sayth saynte Austen:Su{per} Iohn̄ trac. Cxiiii. If he be so a mischeuous person as ye say: why may ye not sley hym, if ye may not sley hym for your solempne feeste of pasche: why do ye crye and saye: crucifye hym / crucifye hym / Pylate perceyuing by theyr wordes that they wold not be cōtent with any small punisshement of Chryste / but that they wolde haue hym slayne: he wolde nedes heare the cause why he shulde dye. And then they perceyued that Pylate was angrye: began to accuse Chryste falsely in many thynges, of the whiche onelye thre we rede in Luke.Luc. 23. A. And so the Iues sayde, Hunc inueni∣mus subuertentem gentem nostram. &c. we founde thys persone subuertynge our people from our lawe. Also forbyddyng the pe∣ple to pay tribute to the emperoure. And saynge hym selfe to be Chryste and our kynge. But these accusacyons were al false. And therfore they sayde: Inuenimus: we haue founde hym, for that was onely in theyr owne malicyous hartes, for it was not truthe in dede: but onelye theyr owne ymagynacyon and inuencyon. For he whiche came to fulfyll the lawe and not to breke it: dyd not subuert the people from ye lawe. Nor he dyd not subuert them: but rather cōuerted them to goodnes whom he taught ye truth, nor he dyd forbyd ye people to pay tribute to ye em¦perour / for he said openly:Mat. 22. C pay or rēder tho thyng{is} to ye emperour
whiche be his,Mat. 17. D and gyue to god that apperteyneth to hym▪ And also he payd tribute for hym selfe and also for Peter, and where he sayd hym selfe to be Christe the kynge: he sayd truthe, but yet he wolde not take vpon hym his kyngdome in this worlde, and so he was falsely accused and that not withstandynge: he wolde not answere one worde for his excuse.Mat. 27. D And therfore Pylate sayd to hym: Non audis quanta aduersum te dicunt testimonia? Doyst not thou heare what and howe many accusacyons they brynge agaynst the? And Iesus answered not one word in the presence of the Iues, in so moche that Pylate moche merueyled therat: And specyally seynge that the Iues vnresonably and with great turmoyle and with importunitye / requyred his death but Christ for all that wolde not answer, remembrynge the sayenge of the wyseman.Eccl. 32. A. Vbi non est auditus: non effundes sermonem: Speake not where as is no conuenient audience. Then Pylate entred in to the motehall, bycause he myght more quietely examyn hym frome the turmoyle and noyse of the people, and there lityll regardynge the firste accusacyon whiche was concernyng theyr lawe, nor yet the seconde accusacyon, for he reputed that to be false, for parauenture he had hard before howe Christ said / gyue to the emperour that is his, therfore he onely examined hym in the thyrde cause saynge:Ioh. 18. F. Tu es ex iudeorum? Arte thou the kyng of Iues? as if he shulde say / is it true that the Iues saye of the / that thou woldest vsurpe and take vpon the the name of a kynge contrarie to the decree and statute of the emperour of Rome / for the emperour had taken frō the Iues ye name of a kyngdome that they shulde haue no kyng / and that was to breke theyr pryde and to take from them all occasyon of rebellyon. Then Iesus said to Pylate A temetipso hoc dicis:Ibidem. an alii tibi dixerūt de me? Spekes thou this of thyne own mynd: or other persons haue spoken this to the of me, shewyng by these wordes yt Pylate dyd not folowe the order of ye lawe, as if he shuld say / if thou knowe yt I haue ta∣ken vpon me the name of a kyng shew openly ye signes or actes of my rebellyon / if onely thou herest this of oder {per}sons / make ordy∣nary inquisition & cause thē to bryng in witnes. Then pylate an∣swered, I am no Iue / and therfore I speke it not of my self / thy people & thy bisshopp{is} haue delyuered ye vnto me / whiche shulde defēce the, but it semeth that yu hast greatly offēded thē: that they so obstinatly do accuse the,Ibidem. what hast yu done? Iesus answered: Regnū meū nō est de hoc mūdo:Apoc. 1. C my kyngdom is not of this world & so he denyes not to be a kyng for he is ye kyng of king{is} and lorde
of lordes, if my kyngdome were of this worlde: my ministres and seruantes wolde feyght for me & defend me then Pylate said: Ergo thou arte a kynge.Ioh. 18. G. And Iesus answered: Tu dicis: Thou sayst so / as if he sayd it is as thou sayst, for I am a kynge, and that thou shuldest knowe the condicyon of my kyngdome, for that cause I was borne temporally into this worlde / and for that cause I came into this worlde: that I might bere testimony and witnes to the truthe, and who so euer is the chylde or louer of truth: he hereth my voyce, Of these wordes we maye take that there be .ii. thynges requyred to the kyngdom of Christ, the first is truth yt it be hard, and the second is obedience: that is yt the truth herd be fulfylled.Ioh. 18. G. Then Pylate sayd: Quid est veritas: what is truth? Pilate dyd not here inquire the diffinition of truth / but what is that vertue of truth: thorough whose perticipation and vertue men be taken and made of the kyngdom of god. The solu¦tion of this question Pylate wold not abyde to here, for seynge that he was not of the kyngdom of christ / nor wold intricate hym self with spūall thynges: therfore he had no cure or desire to here it; and also he cared not for it / bycause he shuld shortly cōdempne the truth. And also bycause he herd a great murmur & trouble of the people without forth feryng some busynes or insureccyon by∣cause he differred ye deth of Christ so longe,Ibidem. and for these causes: he hasted hym to the Iues and sayd to them: Ego nullam causam inuenio in homine isto:Su{per} Iohn̄ omel. 83. I fynde no cause of deth in this man. Here as Chrisostom saith: Pylate dyd substancyally alledge for christ that he nother knewe or coulde fynd any cause of malice in hym. And then the Iues for asmoche as they fayled in theyr proue for wante of resonable causes: wolde haue preuayled by theyr mul∣titude & cryeng,Luc. 23. A. and at laste they brought agaynst hym this accu¦sacyon, He hath troubled al the people from Galilee vnto this cy¦tye, wyllynge so to aggrauate theyr accusacyon / bycause it appa¦red contrarie to the peace of the emperour vnder whome Pylate was the hyghe iudge in Hierusalem, that therby Pylate shulde be the more moued agaynst Christe. But you wycked Iues / howe dyd he moue the people to sedicyon and warre: that euer preached and taughte peace / and came to make peace bytwixte god and man? But spyrytually we maye saye that he moued the people and troubled them frome theyr synfull lyfe / by hys holsome monicyon teachynge them the way of vertue and truth. Of the whiche mocyon and also trouble: the prophete Dauid sayethe:Psal. lix. Commouisti terram: et conturbasti eam: Thou hast
thou hast moued the erth that is erthly persons / and thou hast tro¦bled it, that is / put them from theyr erthly and synfull lyfe / cure / and heale (good lorde) his woundes / for he is moued to good∣nesse and vertue. And Pylate then herynge them speke of Gali∣lee and knowynge that Iesus was of Galilee he sent hym to He∣rode, as ye shall se in the next article. ¶A Lesson. IN this article we may lerne this lesson that we shulde be∣ware that we accuse not our sauiour Christ falsly or of false-thynges. They accuse Christe of false thynges / whiche impute or put any false thyng vpon hym, as the Iues / paganes and he∣retykes do. For the Iues put vpon Christe that he was the natu¦rall sonne of Ioseph the carpenter, and that he was a gloton and a drynker of wyne, that the deuyll was in hym and that he sub∣uerted the people whiche all were false. The paynyms impute to hym that he was a pure man and not god, and that it was in∣possible that god shuld be incarnate. The heritykes put to christ that he had no true bodye / but onely a fantasticall body, and that he was no very true man: but onely apparent. &c. There be other yt accuse god falsly, as these euyl & false christians / which accuse god, as the cause of theyr synnes, saynge: God hath made me of that compleccyon: that I must nedes synne, the constellation or coniunccyon of suche planetes or sterres made me to synne, and god made the sterres, therfore he made me to synne. Thou dost falsly impute thy synne to god. True it is that god made the sterres and also the of that compleccyon / for he create all thynges and they were good. But all these can not compell the to synne, for it is onely the malice and frowardnes of thy wyll. &c. Also a man to conforme hym selfe to this article: shulde remember how he that is the very truth dyd pacyently suffer to be falsly accused for vs, that he myght founde and grounde vs in the truthe. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde for me be falsely accused in many false thynges before the iudge Pylate: teache me to auoyde the disceyres of wicked men and truly to professe thy faith with good werkes. Amen. ¶Howe Christ was sent to Herode. The .xxiii. article.
THe .xxiii. article is the sendynge of Christe to Herode. For whan Pylate herde that Iesus was a man of the countrye of Galilee and so vnder the power of Herode whiche was the captayne and the reuler of Galilee vnder the emperour hauynge this occasyon to delyuer his hand{is} of Christe: sent hym to herode / whiche was the ruler of Galilee and at that tyme he was also in Hierusalem, Pylate wyllynge herby to do honour vnto Herode that he beynge the capteyne of Galilee: shulde delyuer or condempne Christe beynge a man of his countrye / so wyllyng that euery man shulde be examined and iudged of his owne iudge / accordyng to the lawes of the Roma∣nes, and whan Iesus was thus sent / there was a greate cōcurse of people folowynge hym. O blessed lady Marie howe wente thou in suche a multitude? who helped the in that great thronge of people? Surely thou was then the example of sorowe and he∣uynes to all that loueth the or Christe thy sonne,Luc. 23. B. and whan He∣rode dyd se Iesus he had greate ioye therof, not that he thought to wynne ony thynge therby: but for that he was curious to se a straunge man and suche a man / whom he had longe desired to se / that is from the decollacyon or behedyng of saint Iohn̄ the Bap∣tiste, for that tyme Christe beganne to preache openly and to do many miracles, whiche al Herode herynge: was moch desirous to se hym / and to se hym shewe some wonderous signe or miracle, not for any deuocyon: but for curiositie and to proue hym what he coulde do: for he thought that Christe had ben a iugler or any gromancyer, and for this cause he desired to se no miracle of our sauiour Iesus. This sendynge is conueniently accompted a∣monges the articles of Christes passyon, for it is a great displea¦sure for any man to be sent from one iudge to an other, how moch more then was it paynfull to this most swete and innocent lambe our sauyour Iesu? Herode asked of Christe many questyons / as we shal se in the next article. Also there were .CC. passes from Pylates house vnto Herodes house / by the whiche space / bothe goynge and comynge he suffred many despytes and rebukes. ¶A Lesson. IN this article we may lerne this lesson: that is to suffer pacyētly if we be shamfully sent from one iudge to an other for the loue of Christe, seynge that our sauyour Iesus was so ser¦ued. And specially religyous {per}sons which shuld be the folowers
of Christe shulde not be troubled / if somtyme for obedience they be sent from one place to an other, and nowe vnder this prelate / and nowe vnder that. &c. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for my loue dyd not feare to be sent from Py∣late vnto Herode: graunt to me I beseche the that I with a glad mynd for thy loue may obey to the cōmaundement{is} of my superiours thoughe they be wicked, and to do my obedyence promtly and redylye without any grudgynge. Amen. ¶Howe Herode derided and mocked Christ. The .xxiiii. article. THe .xxiiii. article is the derisyon or mockynge that He∣rode dyd to Christe,Luc. 23. B. for after that he was presented to hym: he moued to Christe many questyons and proued hym in them, as parauenture he asked hym whether he was that chyld / at whose birth a new starre dyd appere to the .iii. kynges? and whether he dyd gyue syght to that man which was borne blynde, And if he dyd reyse Lazar that was .iiii. dayes dead? and suche other questyons. Some persons do moue que∣styons onely for curiositie to here newe thynges, some to know the truth / and some onely to tempte and proue howe the other per¦sone can answere, and some to take the answere in a trippe or de∣faute. And Herode here asked Christe many questions / not as a studious person to lerne or knowe the truth: but rather to rebuke Christe, not as a louer of the truthe: but to tempte hym, not to wynne or get any truth or vertue therby: but for curiositie to here newes. And for these causes Christ wolde shewe no token or my∣racle, nor yet answere vnto hym. Also Herode in his questions behaued hym selfe scornfully vnto Christ, and as mockyng hym sayd: If thou wyll do any miracle in my presence / I shall quyte the and delyuer the, and if thou wylt not honour me with some thynge I shall condempne the at the wyl and desyre of thy aduer¦saries these malicyous Iues. But for all this our sauyour Ie∣sus whiche doth all thynges ordinately.Psal. C. xi. And as dauid sayth: Dis¦poseth his wordes and sentēces in ryght reason and iudgement: He (I say) wolde not answere to any one questyon, for he iud∣ged it most godlye to kepe silence at that tyme, for one word spo¦ken without prophet: may be somtyme the cause of the condemp¦nacyon
of the speaker. And at that tyme all the prynces of the Iues stode styfly accusynge Christe, as we shall declare in the nexte article. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson after saynt Gregorye that as ofte as our audience wold here our preachyng / sen∣tence / or mynde, not for to amende therby theyr peruerse and vi∣cyous lyfe: but onely to commende our saynges: then so ofte we shulde kepe silence and speake not as they wolde, for if we shuld for that purpose folowe theyr desyre: we shuld offende god in so doynge, and theyr vicyous lyfe shulde be in no thynge amended therby. There be many thynges wherby we maye knowe and perceyue the mynd of the herer and desyrer, and specyally if they euer prayse that thynge whiche they here, and yet neuer folowe that thynge whiche they so prayse. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde suffer Herode scornfully to de∣maund many questions of the, to the which thou wold not answere one word: graūt to me for thy loue, yt I may paciently here and bere scornfull questyons and mockynge wordes, and that I may declyne and auoyde my vayne prayse by my silence. ¶Howe Christe was accused before Herode. The .xxv, article. THe .xxv. article is the accusacyon of Christe before Herode.Luc. 23. B. For as Luke sayth: Stabant principes facer dotum et scribe constanter accusantes eum. The prin¦ces of the preestes and the scribes stode styfely accu∣synge Christe before Herode.Libro. xiii. And here Symon de Cassia saith: I wolde that the euangeliste or the interpreter that translated the euangelie of Luke out of Greke in to Latyne had vsed this terme or worde pertinaciter: rather than this worde constanter, for constantia is a name of vertue: and suche a ver∣tue as it is not conuenient and agreynge to enuyous or hatefull persons and all gyuen to mischeyfe. But this worde pertinatia, that is frowardnes: is conuenient to suche euyll persons, for it is the name of a vyce / and that suche a vice which wyll not gyue ouer or cease vnto the tyme his malicyous mynde be broughte to purpose. These malicyous Iues stode obstinatlye and styfelye
accusynge Christe that he myght be shortly put to deth, and they as the chylderne of deth: wold not suffer the lyfe to lyue vpon the erth, they accused Christe before Herode specyallye saynge that Christe had troubled and moued al the people begynnyng in Ga¦lilee / whiche was vnder the rule of Herode yt therby they myght the more rather moue hym agaynst Christ, bycause he had trou∣bled & moued the people in his dominion. And notwithstādyng the accusacyons of Christ before Herode were the same that were spoken before Pylate: yet for asmoche as that they were spoken before an other iudge, and so a newe payne and sorowe was ther¦by vnto Christe: therfore this article is put here as diuerse or an other from the .xxii. article. And as Christe in no thynge wolde answere vnto Herode: so he in no thynge answered to his accu∣sers.Su{per} Lucā. Cap. 98. But as saynt Ambrose sayth: He kept silence bycause theyr vnfaythfulnes deserued not to here the truth of god, and our lord also declyned then or wolde auoyde iactance and vayne prayse, for he wolde do no miracle before Herode as he then wolde glad∣ly haue sene. Also he wolde not then shewe any miracle bycause he wolde not let his passion.Su{per}. 23. Luce. And as Albert sayth: The pride and curiositie of Herode dyd not deserue it. And her to our lorde com¦maūded in his gospell sayng Nolite sanctum dare canibus:Mat. 7. A. Gyue no holy thynge to dogges, do no miracles before suche as wyll not prophet by them. Also ye knowe that a worde can not be spo∣ken or formed without a voyce, so bycause our sauyour Iesus is the eternall worde of god, and saynt Iohan the Baptist is called the voyce of that same worde, & Herode slewe that voyce Iohan Baptiste the Eester laste passed the yere before, therfore he was not worthy to here yt eternal worde of god that is Christ / speke. And furthermore he was not worthy to heare Christe speake / for his manyfolde scornynge wordes, and also to gyue vs example / that we may better ouercome vayne and mockynge wordes / by silence then by speakynge. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne this lesson, that truth is not to be spoken or shewed / in all places / in all tymes / nor to all persons, for oftymes it is better to kepe silence as we said before. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche presented before Herode wolde for my loue suffer the false accusacyons of the Iues, and thou wolde not excuse thy selfe / or deny in any worde theyr iniust sayenges:
graunt to me that I be nat ouercome by the iniuries of wycked men / nor that I shewe thy holy misteries to the vnworthy {per}sons. ¶Howe Christe was despised of Herode. The .xxvi. article. THe .xxvi. article is of the despeccyon that Herode and his seruauntes dyd to Christ / for Herode seyng Christ wolde not shewe any signe or miracle before hym, nor speake one word to all his questions, nor yet answere to the accusacyons of the Iues for his owne defence: He repu∣ted hym to be a fole and to haue no witte or reason,Luc. 23. B. And therfore he despysed hym and so dyd all his compeigney and seruauntes. Fyrst bycause Christe kepte so stably his silence in no thynge mo∣ued to speake though the Iues dyd so falsly accuse hym. Second¦ly Herode dispised Christ, bycause he reputed hym a fole or fere∣full of the death that the Iues labored to bryng hym vnto, or els for that he thought Christe to be presumptuous in his lyuynge and maners / and nowe kepte silence: bycause he could not defend his owne cause for want of good reason and iustice in his cause. And thyrdly he wolde be despysed of Herode for a greate miste∣rie, it is a profounde misterie and gyueth to vs a matter of hygh contemplacyon, to consider howe the eterne wysdome of god: wolde be reputed folisshnes, and the infinite power of god wold be taken for infirmitie as of lytyll or of no power, so that Christ the sonne of god very god and man wolde be made the obprobry or rebuke of men, the abiection and out cast of the people / and the mockynge stocke of kynges and great men. And in lyke ma∣ner nowe a dayes the folowers of Christ be dispysed of euyl men and reputed as foles, and that specyally when such euyl persons haue a wicked reuler or heed, for comonly suche persons shortlye consent vnto suche a captayn or reuler. A comen prouerbe / Such a kynge hath suche counsellers & lyke seruantes, and therfore it was so moch ye more to the obprobry & rebuke of Christ / that not onely Herode despysed Christe: but also al his compaigney and seruantes. And in these dayes there be many that dispyse Iesus as Herode dyd: lokynge to se signes and miracles nowe / whan it is not tyme to shewe signes / but rather to do good werkes / our lorde sayd of the Iues:Luc. 16. G. Habent moisen et prophetas: They haue moysen that is the lawe of moyses and the prophetes, lette them here them and folowe them. And we haue morouer the gospelles
and the apostles with the actes and apocalipse / and yet we wolde se signes, we do not fulfyll the gospell and in lyuynge therafter: but rather we desppyse it. This despysynge of Christe is con∣ueniētly taken for an article of Christes passyon, for syth it wold greue any man to se hym self despysed of other men and specyally of great men though he were but symple and an ideote: moche more it shulde greue our sauyour Christe whiche was all good / omnipotent and most wise, to be mocked & taken as omnipotent bycause he wolde do no miracle before Herode / to be reputed an ideote without knowlege: bycause he wolde not answere to hys questions, to be accompted as a fole / bycause he wold not defende hym selfe agaynst his accusers, and not onely they despysed hym in wordes: but also in dede, puttynge a folys cote vpon Christ / as ye shall se in the nexte article. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson / that we shulde ra∣ther wyll to be despysed of euyll persons: then to be com∣mended of flaterers. As our lorde (after saynte Gregorie) dyd chose rather to be openly dispised of proude persons: then vayn∣ly to be lauded of vnfaythfull persones. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche was contente to be despysed for me of Herode and his compaignye or seruantes: graunte me to despyse all worldly pompe for the / and not to regarde the despysynge of wicked men for thy loue and for iustyce. Amen. ¶Howe Christe was cladde with a whyte garment to his despysyng. The .xxvii. article. THe .xxvii. article is the mockynge of Christe with a whyte garment / whiche was put vpon hym to his great confusyon and shame.Libro. xiii. And here saith Symon de Cassia that this worde albedo / that is to saye / whitnes, is not taken at all tymes in scripture for vertue / or to the best parte, for somtyme it signifyeth the want of vertues, and so this whyt vest¦ment wherwith Herode dyd mocke Christ doth shewe what was Herode and his seruantes or folowers, for he and all they were
voyde of all the multiplicacitye or varietie and diuersitie of ver∣tues, and so theyr mockynge of Christe / turned to theyr owne preiudice / and to theyr euerlastynge despeccyon and rebuke. It is euer knowen to be a greate illusion and mockynge of Chryst: when his vertues are forsaken for worldlye pompe, whan his teachynges be despysed and all his dedes that he dyd and paynes that he suffred for our loue: be no thynge regarded. And so dyd Herode here / for not onely he despysed hym: but also as Luke sayth:Cap. . B. Illusit indutum veste alba, He cladde hym in a whyte cote (whiche was taken for a folys cote) and so mocked hym in dede / to the greate derisyon of Christ, for Herode wold haue hym kno¦wen of all people for a fole. For it is lyke that that tyme to haue or weare a whyte garment: was a signe or token of a fole / and it is also very lyke that that whyte garment was lengar than the stature of Christe, and so therby thorowe the thurstyng & throng of the cruel Iues: he was oftymes thrawen downe to the groūd. But thoughe Herode dyd thus aray Christe to his rebuke: yet this whyte garment was not without greate misterie: as were all the other actes and dedes aboute the passyon of Christ. Ther¦fore as saynt Ambrose sayth:Su{per} Lucā. Cap. 98. This whyte garment doth signify the immaculate and innocent passion of Christe, for he without spotte of synne: dyd beare and suffer payne for all synnes of the worlde, whiche whyte garment is signifyed by the albe of the preeste wherin he sayth masse, for the vestmentes that the bisshop or preest vseth at masse: doth represēt the hole passion of Christ. For our hygh bysshop Christe was cladde in his passyon with all the ornamentes of a bysshop. Fyrste he toke his amysse when the Iues couered his face / he toke his albe: whan Herode cladde hym in this whyte garment / he toke his manyple whan the Iu∣es or saugiours bonde his handes, but what tyme they lowsed his handes and put a rede in his ryght hande: then the corde or bonde dyd remayne vpon his lefte hande, and in token herof / the preest vseth the maniple vpon the lefte hande or arme / he toke his gyrdle: when he was bounde aboute the myddle to the pyller, he toke his stole: when he was bounde by the necke to the pyller, he toke his chesyble: when the saugiours of Pylate put an olde purpur garment vpon hym, he had a crowne of thornes for hys mytour, he had a rede in his hand for his crosse, he had his glo∣uys for his handes & his sandalles for his feete: when they were made all redde with blode. The sandalles haue a reed hole aboue wrought with red sylke, and the glouys haue an vche or a redde
precyous stone, or otherwyse wrought with red: to signifye the woundes of Christ in his handes and feete. These be the orna∣mentes of a bisshop whan he doth consecrate any thyng. Also ma¦ny of these the preest doth vse at his masse, to signify that he shuld haue in his vnderstandynge the meditacyon of Christes passion / in his memorie the remembraunce therof. The compassion ther of in his affection and wyll, so that as he is lyke to Christ in his vestmentes: so he may be lyke in his herte and mynde and also ly¦uynge, for who so euer hath these outwarde tokens of Christes passion / nothyng fealyng inwardly by meditacyon and compas∣syon: doth not serue or loue Christ: but rather mocke hym with Herode, which in that white garmēt sent hym to Pilate agayne, As it shall appere in the nexte article. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne this lesson, all they that wyll lyue godly & innocently after the example of our newe man Christ: shalbe mocked & be had as folys of other persons yt lyue after the old synful maner. But for al this, the true spirituall ser∣uantes of god / shulde not be troubled: but rather ioyfull / for the newe man our sauiour Christ clad in a white garmēt which sig¦nifyeth (to vs christians) his innocētie was mocked & of the chylderne of this worlde, to whome that white garmente was a signe of folisshenes. Also a man in his garmentes or aray¦ment shuld onely loke for profyt and his necessitie, and nothyng for vanitie or curiositie, for our sauyour was reputed as a fole for his aray. And that a man myghte conforme hym selfe to this article: he shulde thanke god: that it wold please hym to gyue to vs the garment of innocentie: for the derision that he suffred of his whyte cote. And a man shulde also oftymes thynke howe oft he hath defoyled by his sinnes, that white vestment of innocentie whiche our lorde gaue to vs at our baptisme, and pray thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu which wold be for me clad in a white garment & moc∣ked as a fole of Herode and his seruātes: graūt me warely to declyne or auoyde the wisdome of this worlde whiche in thy syght is but a folisshenes, and with a pure hert to come to the, whiche arte the very true wisdome. Amen. ¶Howe Christ was sent agayne to Pylate. The .xxviii.
THe .xxviii. article is the sendyng agayn of Christ from Herode vnto Pilate, for Herode when he fond no cause of deth in christ: he dispysed & mocked hym & sent hym agayn to Pilate in a white cote, and in this it apereth that he dyd cōsent vnto ye deth of Christ / for sith Christe was sent to Herode as one of his iurisdiction & vnder his power, when he se no cause worthy deth {pro}ued of Christ: he shulde haue absolued hym & deliuered hym from ye handes of the Iues, and not to haue sent agayn vnto a straūge iuge ye which had no power ouer hym. And so Herode offēded in that yt he sent Christ agayne vnto Py∣late,Luc. 23. B. which sēdyng agayne is cōueniently taken for a speciall ar∣ticle, for therby Christ had a newe payne & labour. Also for that he returned agayne to Pylate clad in a white cote: to his greate shame & rebuke. Thyrdly by cause also he brought wt hym, He∣rodes consent of his owne deth, whiche appered both in signe or token and also in dede, In signe: bycause he was sent in a folys cote,Ibidem. In dede: that is in the cōfederation of theyr frendshyp / for that same day Herode & Pylate by this sendynge of Christe were made frendes where as before they were enemyes, which frend∣shyp of Herode & Pylate was a figure & sygne that the Iues and gentyles shulde agre to gether in the persecucyon of christians, Or els we may take this frendshyp for a good signe: saynge that the Iues & gentiles which before ye deth of Christ were enemies, by his deth were made frendes & agreynge in one faythe of Iesu Christe. For he is the peace or corner stone that ioyneth the two diuerse peoples in one. And whan Pylate se that Herode sente Christe agayne vnto hym: he was very sorye therof. And so cast in his mynde howe he myghte delyuer Christe frome deth. And therfore he called togyther the prynces of the preestes / the greate men of the Iues / and the comen people, and goynge forth to them: sayde / ye haue broughte and presented to me this man. &c. As in the nexte article. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson, that the nature of goodnes hathe suche strengthe and vertue that it agreithe euyll persones and maketh theym frendes / and specyallye in the persecucyon of goodnes / and therfore the euyll persons may be well signifyed by the foxes that Sampson toke and tyed theyr tayles togyther,Iudic. 15. A to distroye the corne and fruyte of his aduer∣saries.
So euyll persons ben confedered and tyed togyther to persue good men,Psal. 2. and so Herode and Pylate, the Iues and the gentiles agreed to gyther against our lord and his sonne Christ. And herto sayth Theophilus: The deuyll in al places cōioyneth and agreeth enemyes to conspyre the deth of Christe. Therfore the iute person shulde not be afrayd / thoughe he se euyll persons copled agaynst hym, for that is a signe yt there is some goodnes in hym, and therby also he is cōformed & made lyke vnto Christ / agaynst whom all euyl persons agreed in one, and also those per¦sons as were enemyes before. Also a man to conforme hym selfe to this article shuld remember what payne it was to Christe to be so shamfully led from one iudge to an other, and if a man haue any hatred in his herte agaynst any persone: let hym forgyue it with all his hert, and that for the loue of Christ, the whiche for vs in his blessed passyon wolde also agree wycked persones and make them frendes, and praye thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde be sent agayne from Herode vn¦to Pylate, and therby wolde make them frendes: graunt me that I feere not the frenshyp of wicked men agaynste me, but rather that I may so profyte by theyr exercyse: that I maye de∣serue to be conformed and made lyke vnto the. Amen. ¶Howe Christ was forsaken of the Iues / and Barrabas by them was delyuered. The .xxix. article. THe .xxix. article is the reprouing or forsakyng of Christ for whan Christ was brought agayn to Pilate he called together the princes of the preest{is} / the great men of the Iues & the comen people / and goyng forth vnto theym sayd:Luce. 23. BC. Obtulisti mihi hūc hoiem quasi auertētem populum. &c. Ye haue sented this man vnto me as a subuerter of the people, and behold said Pylate / I examynyng hym afore you / can not fynde hym gylty in any such cause as ye accuse hym of / nor yet Herode, for I sent you vnto hym / and loo nothynge worthy deth is done vnto hym. Pylate went forth of ye motehall to ye Iues that stode without / and that he dyd to excuse christ / and to shewe ye blyndnes or maliciousnes of the accusers.Libro. xiii. And here saith Symon de Cas∣sia: The Iues stode without for they knewe not the inwarde se∣cretes and misteries of the lawe / they were put without from the light of truthe / and frome al shynynge and operation of vertue▪ Pylate wente forthe to confounde the Iues, he wente forthe to theym: Not as moued to consente vnto theyr malyce: but
to declare and shewe vnto them in what euyls / peryls / and daun∣gers that people standethe: whiche is excluded frome all good∣nes. And therfore openly before all that were present he wolde reproue and shewe to be vayne all suche accusacyons as they had spoken agaynst Christ, whom after due examinacyon: he founde innocent. And also he went forth to the Iues to signifye spiri∣tually that they shulde be caste out of theyr kyngdome and also frome the kyngdome of god. And ferthermore Pylate sayde to the Iues, ye haue a custome that I shulde dimise at your deno∣mination one prisoner euery paschall tyme / to his liberty, which of these .ii wyll ye haue delyuered from prysone to libertye, Ie∣sus / or Barrabas. In this eleccyon: the Iues dyd chose Bar∣rabas,Libro. xiii. and yt was to shewe theyr peruerse / obstinate & malicy∣ous mynde. And here sayth Symon de Cassia: Pylate put to the eleccyon of the Iues whither they wolde delyuer Barrabas / or Christe, Barrabas was a stronge thefe / a sedicyous persone / and a manquellar, Christe was al good / Pylate ioyned these .ii. togyther / that they considerynge the mischeuous lyfe of the one and the goodnes of the other though there be no comperison by∣twene good and euyll) they shulde condempne the euyll persone and delyuer ye good.Luc. 23. C. And after that Pylate had granted to them a space and tyme to consider whom they wold chose: the prynces of the preestes and the seniours of the people dyd perwade and moue the people to aske Barrabas. And then Pylate inquiryng whiche of these .ii. they wolde haue delyuered: they asked that Barrabas might be put to libertie: and that Christ shulde be con¦dempned vnto most cruell deth. And therfore it foloweth in the gospell: Tunc vniuersa exclamauit turba: tolle hunc: et dimitte no his Barraban: All the people cryed away with Christ: and dely∣uer Barrabas vnto vs, as if these malicyous Iues shulde saye: sley hym yt dyd rayse deed folkes and delyuere that thefe & man∣sleyar Barrabas, that he may sley them that be on lyfe. And ther¦fore vnto this day the Iues can haue no peace, bicause they wold rather chose the sedicyous thefe Barrabas, and so in hym the se dicyous prince & captayne of all synne the deuyll / whiche vnto this day doth reigne in them (rather I say) than Christ. Theyr example done folowe nowe a dayes such persons that wyl rather help & {pro}mote euyl men: then good men. And so in many elections and {pro}uisions of benefices or offices torall & spūall / Iesus / that is ye good {per}son ye frend of god which hath a good wyl to help and saue him self & also other / & therfore worthy to be chosē & {pro}moted:
is reproued and put awaye. And contrary wyse / Barrabas / the euyll and vnworthy person / and the enemy of Christe, whiche wyll slay hym selfe and also other in soule: is chosen and promo∣ted. And this article of Christes passyon: is not the leste, or of lytyll payne, for syth any man wyll be sory to se hym selfe repro∣ued / and also an other not so worthy: promoted: howe moche more then myght Christe be ory / seynge that so vyle and damp∣nable a person was preferred before hym, and that the Iues dyd aske the lyfe of the manslayer,Mat. 27. C and the lyfe of the sonne of god. And then Pylate asked of them: Quid faciam de Iesu qui dicitur Christus? What shall I do with Iesus whiche is called Christe your kynge and Messias? Pylate spake this to make them asha¦med of theyr iniquitie and also shewynge the mesure of theyr wic¦kednes, but the Iues were nother ashamed of that Pylate con∣fessed Iesus to be theyr messias:Ibidem. nor yet kept the mesure of theyr wickednes. For they all cryed with one voyce crucifigatur: cru¦cifye hym,Omel. 35. su{per} Math. in the whiche saynge (as Origene sayth) they multy¦plyed the measure of theyr wickednes. For before Cayphas they sayde: he is worthy deth, and nowe before the iudge they deter∣mine the kynde and maner of death sayng: Crucifye hym. ¶A Lesson. IN this article we may lerne this lesson / that we quietly and pacyently suffer if any persone of vyle condicyon and euyll maners be preferred before vs, considerynge that a stronge thefe and a manqueller was preferred before Christe god and man. ¶A prayer. O Iesu Christ the sonne of the lyuyng god, whiche for man∣nes saluacyon disdeyned not in the thyrde houre of the day to be reproued and forsaken of the Iues that dyd aske the sedicy∣ous thefe Barrabas, to be delyuered from deth vnto his liberty. And wolde haue the the auctor and gyuer of lyfe to be crucifyed: graunt to me that I may euer chose the my creatour and maker before all other, and neuer to reproue or forsake the: for any cre∣ature. Amen. ¶The pullynge of the garmentes of Christ. The .xxx. article.
THe .xxx. article is the puttyng of Christes garmentes. For whan Pylate heroe that the Iues dyd aske Bar∣rabas to be dimyed: and Iesus to be crucifyed: he sayd vnto them:Luc. 23. C. Quid enim mali fecit: Nullam causam mortis inueno in eo: Corripiam ergo illum et dimittam. What euel hathe Iesus done / I fynde no cause of deth in hym, therfore yf he committed any trespas agaynste your awe or ceremonyes / I shall correcte and amende hym and so dimisse hym. In these wor∣des Pylate beganne to swerue frome the iustyce of the lawe / he sayd that he wolde correcte and amende the innocent.Luc. 23. C. O Pylate if he be innocent:Mat. 27. C howe mayst thou amende hym or correcte hym. except thou decline from iustice? and so furthwith he toke Christ and began to rebuke hym. And firste they put of his garmentes, and this was no lytyll iniurie and rebuke to Christe to be strypt naked before all the compaigney. And though Christe was not borne of that infecte and corrupte stocke of Adam, wherby oure nakednes was made shamfull (for before that Adam dyd synne / he was naked & in nothynge abashed therof / but after that he had synned: he was ashamed of his nakednes, and therfore he sayd: Timui eo {quod} nudus essem: et abscondi me:Gene. 3. B. I was afrayd or ashamed bycause (sayd Adam) that I was naked / and therfore I dyd hyde me) thoughe I say Christ was not borne by the sede of man: yet bycause he came to take our infirmities and to suffer for our yn∣nes: therfore he was abasshed to be sene naked / and so moche the more ashamed then all other chast virgyns be: in how moch that his honesty and chastitye excelled without comparison the clen∣nes of all other virgyns. And whan Iesus was thus naked / Py¦late toke hym to the saugiours to be scourged as ye shall se in the next article. And note here that one doctor sayth that Christ was thryes scourged. Fyrste with roddes: bycause he dyd trouble and moue the people / and there he had .xl. strokes saue one, accor∣dynge to the commaundement of the lawe.Deut. 25. A Secondly with ru∣shys of the see, whiche be more sharp than thornes, and this bea¦tynge was bycause he had preached and taught a newe doctrine. And here he was scourged as Heliodore was by the angelles of whome we rede in the seconde boke of the Machabeis. Thyrd∣lye they scourged hym with whyppes.Cap. 3. E. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson that as Christe had his garmentes pulled of his bdye and was stryped naked: so shulde we put of our olde synfull cote and lyfe, and make open
and naked our cōscience before god and his minister our curate, by pure and playne confession of all our synnes, auoyde all cloke and colour of excusacyon / for al thynges ben open and naked be∣fore the syght of god. And a man to conforme hym selfe vnto this article: shulde remember howe miserably / and with howe moch iniurie and shame Christe was strypt naked and his clothes vio¦lentlye pulled of hym. And praye thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wold haue thy clothes pulled violent∣lye of thy backe and wolde be strypt naked to be scourged: graunt to me that I may caste of from me myne olde synfull cote or lyfe with al his operations by true / pure and playne confession of all my synnes and that I neuer apere in thy syght naked from vertues. Amen. ¶Howe Christe was scourged. The .xxxi. article. THe .xxxi. article is the scourgynge of Christe. For when Iesus was so strypt naked: Pylate delyuered hym to the saugiours.Ioh. 19. A. The gospell sayth: Apprehendit illum Pilatus et flagellauit: Pylate toke Christe and scourged hym, that is, Pliate made hym to be scourged of his saugiours, that the Iues (as saynt Austen sayth) sacyate and content with those his paynes and rebukes:Su{per} Iohn̄ tract. cxvi. shulde desyre no more his death. And so he that dyd lowse them that were bounde / our sauiour Ie∣sus was bounde fast to a pyllar, whiche was so great and thycke that his armes & his handes myght nat compas it. And therfore the saugiours corrupt by mony drewe out his armes with harde cordes: that all the vaynes of his armes appered out to the extre¦mitie. And then those saugiours called in all theyr compaigney and our sauiour Iesus so bounde and naked / they bette so cruel∣ly with roddes / knotted whyppes and thorny rushes of the see: that they dyd teare the flesh and drewe it away / so that his bones ware sene bare, and also greate gobettes and pecys of the flesshe hange vpon the scourges and whyppes. There stode naked be∣fore all the people: the most louely yonge man / eligant and sham fast, beautious aboue all other men, speakynge not one worde / but as meake as a lambe dyd suffer pacyently the harde / sharppe and paynfull beatynges of those most vyle & cruell tormentours.
That most innocent and tender flesshe, most pure and most fayre the floure of all mankynde was replete and full of strokes / blo∣mes / woundes and brosers / he was wounded thorow out all his moste holye bodye, so that fro the toppe of the hed vnto the sole of his foote: there was none hole skynne. That noble and pre∣cyous blode of his: ranne from euery parte of his bodye, the cru¦ell tormentours added plage vpon plage and heped wounde vp∣pon wounde / brosynge vpon brosynge / blode vpon blode / vnto the tyme that both the cruell tormentours and also the beholders, were wery of smiynge and seynge, and so he was commaunded to be lowsed from the pyllar. And here sayth saynte Barnarde: that the tormentours dyd ons lowse Iesus, and bounde hym a∣gayne / turnynge his backe to the pyllar and bounde his handes aboue his heed, that they myght scourge hym vpon bely & breste and also his face, and so they spared no place of his most tender bodye whose crueltye cōsyderynge some of the pagans there stan¦dynge and beholdynge this sorowfull scourgynge: ranne to our lorde and bracke the ropes and so dyd lowse hym, and those cru∣ell tormētours not saciate with that scourgyng: pulled the heyre of his most blessed berde and also of his heed, wherin was ful∣fylled the prophecye of Esay:Esaie. 1. C. Corpus meum dedi percutientibus: et genas meas vellentibus: which auctoritie we declared before in the .xvi. article. ¶But howe many plages or woundes our sauyour Iesus had at this scourgynge, it can not be knowen but by reuelacyon, for they were in a maner innumerable, forsythe scripture sayth Pro mensura peccati:Deut. 25. A erit plagarum modus: After the measure of the synne: shalbe the measure of the beatynges or plages: and Christe was scourged for our synnes / whiche be in∣numerable: therfore his plages and woundes muste be innume∣rable. And that noted,Esaie. 1. B. the prophet whan he sayde of Christe, A planta pedis vs{que} ad verticem capitis: non est in eo sanitas: Frome the toppe of his hed vnto the sole of his fote: there was no hoole parte in hym.Su{per} Mat. 27. As saynte Hierom sayth: Christe wolde be scour∣ged that therby he might deliuer vs from perpetual scourgyng{is}. As a louynge mother seynge the father beatynge her sonne: wyl runne bytwixt the rodde & her sonne with her armes spred abrode and receyue the strokes to defende her sonne from that beatynge / so dyd Christe for vs, and therin was verifyed the saynge of the prophet that he spake of Christe sayenge:Esae. 53. B Disciplina pacis nostre super eum: et liuore eius sanati sumus: The disciplyne of our peace dyd lyght vpon hym: that is: the beatynges which we deserued
for our synnes / and were not punysshed for them. but lyued in peace and pleasure / these beatynges (I say) dyd fall vpon Christ and so by his woundes we were made hole. And after that Iesus was thus scurged: they mocked hym in many thynges / as it shal appere in diuers articles folowynge. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson that we shuld gladly suffer ye scourges of god / so that euery one of vs might say truely with the prophet:Psal. 37. Ego in flagella paratus sum: I am prepa¦red and redy to receyue beatynges. And that is conuenient. For syth the onely sonne of god was redye to receyue vpon his owne bodye beatynges and scourgynges for our synnes, and that at the obedience of god his father: moche more then shulde we that be but the adoptyue chylderne of god: be redy to suffer gladly the scourges of our father in heuen, whiche he by hym selfe or by his ministres, doth mercyfully sende to vs for our amendement. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde for me be bounde to a pyllar and gre∣uously scourged: graunt to me that I may pacientlye and gladly beare the scourges of thy fatherly correccyon, and neuer to scourge the agayne with my synnes. Amen. ¶Howe they put an olde purpur cote vpon Christe. The .xxxii. article. THe .xxxii. article is the puttynge on of an olde purpull cote, for after that Christe was scourged and lowsed from the pyllar: they ledde hym so naked and scourged aboute the house to gather vp his clothes / which were cast about the house in diuers places by those cruel tormentours, and when he hadde founde them and wolde haue put them vpon hym: those most wicked saugiours sayd to Pylate: Syr / this lewde felowe called hym selfe a kynge, therfore (if it please you we shall aray hym lyke vnto a kynge, and so moche scornfullye they brought before hym al the ornamentes cōuenient for a kyng, and then these wretches called in all theyr compaigney / that they myght mocke Christe asmoche as any of them wolde, before that
they wolde put hym vnto the deth, Pylate paraduenture / com∣maundynge / or at leste sufferynge that it shulde so be and that he dyd to mitigate and swage the furie and malicyous mynd of the Iues.Su{per} Iohn̄ Omel. 83. Or els as Crisostom sayth: The saugiours dyd thus to please the Iues of whom they receyued money. Fyrste they put vpon hym a robe of purpull / a kynges garment / but it was olde / to the more confusyon of Christe,Mat. 17. B this garment was conuenient for the bodie of Christe so scurged, for it was of red coloure and all his bodye was red with his owne blode. And herin was ful∣fylled the question that the prophet moued in the persons of the angelles saynge:Esae. 63. A. Quare rubrum est indumētum tuum: et vestimen ta tua sicut calcantium in torculari: Why is thy clothyng red / and thy garmentes as of them that treyd in the presse, to the whiche Christe answereth by the same prophet saynge: Torcular calcaui solus: I alone haue troden in the presse, I alone haue suffred the pressure and payne of the crosse of scourgynges and beatynges for the synne of Adam and all mankynde, and therfore my bodye (whiche is as the garment of my godhed) is all red. Also this purpull vestment was moche conuenient to Christe, for purpull colour is made of the blode or lyquor of a certen fysshe of the see that is called in latyn Murex or conchilium, some men call it a Whelke, it is a shell fysshe. Our sauyour Christe was cladde on good Fryday with .iii. maner of garmentes, that is / a whyte garment / a scarlet robe / and a purpull robe, to signify that who so euer wylbe of the houshold of Christ: he must were the whyte garment of innocentie, the reed or scarlet of charitie and obedy∣ence, and the purpull of penaunce. ¶A Lesson. IN this article we may take this lesson, that we shulde hyde and couer our synnes with the werkes of charitie, for like as Christ scourged and wounded for our synnes wold be couered and clad with a robe of purpull: so we shulde couer and hyde our blody werkes / that is our synnes with the purple of florisshynge charitie,Iaco. 5. D. For as saynte Iames sayth: Charitie couereth and hydeth the multitude of synnes. Or els by the purpull may be noted the remembraunce of the passyon of Christ. Herunto it is writen in the canticles of the spouse of god, that is the faythfull soule: Come capitis eius: sicut purpura regis, The heyre of her hed:Cant. 7. B. be as the purpull of a kynge, for the cogi∣tations
of our mynde whiche be signifyed by the heyre of oure hed: shuld be diligently and continually occupyed in the remem¦braunce of the pasyon of Christ, or els aboute other werkes of charitie. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article and to the .vii. other folowynge: shulde diligently remember the acte of euery article with the circumstances of the same. And praye thus or in lyke maner. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde be clad in an olde purpull robe to thy dispysynge: graunte me continuallye to haue in my mynde or to be clad with the remembraunce of thy passyon, and to hyde and couer my synnes with the purpul of charitie. Amen. ¶Howe Christ was crowned with thornes. The .xxxiii. article. THe .xxxiii. article is the puttynge of the crowne of thornes vpon the hed of Christe.Ioh. 19. A. A kynge shulde haue a deademe or a crowne, and for this crowne, the saugiours writhed a crowne of thornes & thurst it harde vpon his hed as a man shuld put a garlande vpon an other mannes hed. And this crowne was of the sharpe russhes of the see, whiche hath sharp corners and prickes, more sharpe and persynge than thornes. This crowne they put vpon his hed with the prickes dounwarde vnto his hed: not so moche to hurte hym: as to mocke hym therwith, though they dyd both mocke hym and also moste greuously payne and hurte hym, and herunto sayth saynt Barnarde, That godlye hed of Christ was persed vnto the brayne with those thornes, in so moche that the blode that ranne from his hed: dyd wasshe his forhed / chekes / all his face and necke. In this crowne was .lxxvii. sharp thornes, of these thornes it was spoken to Adam:Gene. 3. D. Terra spinas et tribulos germinabit tibi: The erth shall bryng forth or burgen to the / thor∣nes and breers / for the erth of our bodye doth burgen and brynge forth many synnes, whiche with theyr prickes dothe prycke and wounde our conscience / as thornes the bodye. Christ toke these thorne and bare them as a crowne of victorie. These warry∣ours that haue ouercome theyr enemyes / are wonte to beare or weare the armoure of theyr aduersaries subdued / in a signe or
token of victorie, and do greatly reioyse therin. So Christe the lambe of god whiche hath ouercome the deuyll and taken a∣way the synnes of the worlde: and wolde weare a crowne of thor¦nes vpon his hed, in token of his victorie. For as I sayd before these thornes were our frute and the badge of our armes, & ther∣fore Christe wolde weare them. It is moche pleasaunt and also desyrous to euery louyng soule / to se our kyng with this crowne. And herunto the spousesse in her canticles callethe all fayth∣full soules sayng:Cant. 3. D. Egredimini filie sion et videte regem salomonem in diademate. &c. O ye doughters of syon / or faithful soules / come forth and se your true kynge Salomon Iesus Christ in his dia∣deme or crowne with the whiche his mother the sinagoge of thē Iues hath crowned hym, or els spiritually: his mother charitie hath thus crowned hym. For as saynt Barnarde saythe: Thy loue (O blessed Iesu) and our iniquitie: made the to be scourged and crowned and nayled to the crosse.Gen. 22. C. A figure of this crownyng we rede, that Abraham se a shepe or a wether fastned by his hor∣nes amonge the thornes, in the whiche visyon, he spyrytuallye dyd se Christe crowned with thornes. ¶Here folowe .ii. Lessons. THe firste lesson of this article is, that we euer bere our synnes by remembraunce in our mynde, puttyng vpon our hed a crowne of thornes, that is / not to differ / but spedely to take vpon vs with a pure conscience, an hard and paynfull lyfe, as in abstinence / watche / labour / and other werkes of penaunce for god, as Christe wolde beare vpon hys hed the thornes of our synnes for our loue. ¶Second is that we shuld labour to be crowned with the thornes of temptations. For euery temptacyon that doth impugne vs: is as a thorne pric¦kynge the hed of our soule, whiche temptation if a man ouer∣come: he prepareth and byeth a precyous gemme to his crowne / and as many temptacyons as he ouercummeth: so many precy∣ous stones he addeth to his owne crowne of glorie. And ther∣fore the spouse sayth in his canticles:Cap. 2. A. Sicut lilium inter spinas: sic amica mea inter filias: As the lylye florissheth among the thor∣nes / so doth my faithfull frende amonge the doughters of thys worlde by pacyence / meaknes / and charitie. ¶A prayer.
O Iesu whiche for me wold be crowned with thornes: make me so worthely to be compuncte by the thornes of penance / that I may deserue to be crowned of ye in thy heuenly kyngdom. ¶Howe the saugiours put a rede in Christes ryght hande. The .xxxiiii. article. THe .xxxiiii. article is the puttyng of a rede in Christes ryght hande for his regall sceptre,Mat. 27. D signifyenge therby that his kyngdome (whiche he vsurped callynge hym selfe a kyng) was voide and weyke as a rede, but they dyd not remember that Christe sayde:Ioh. 1. F. My kyngdome is not of this worlde / that is transitorie, and this was the thyrde acte of theyr scornfull illusyon. These .iii. that is / a purpull robe / a crowne or a deademe / and a sceptre be the ornamentes of a kyng, the whiche thre / these cruell saugiours gaue vnto Christe to his greate contumelie and illusyon, and therby, they wolde shewe that Christe was a false treytour agaynste the emperour / bycause he wolde haue vsurped and taken vpon hym (as they sayde) to be a kynge agaynst the ordynaunce of the emperour. But that they dyd to the cōfusion and rebuke of Christ: he turned it to his owne glorie & excellency,su{per} Math. 27. & herunto saynt Hierom saith: Christe helde the rede in his hand to write the sacrilege of the Iues / and to shewe hym selfe to be that person that shuld write his elect peo¦ple in the boke of lyfe.Su{per} Mat. canone. 33. And saynt Hillary saith: Therfore oure lorde wold hold the rede in his right hand: that therby he might shewe / that he wyll kepe & maynteyne his seruantes though they be frayle & weyke / and he wyll replenyssh them with al goodnes. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson that we shulde dili∣gently remember that we of our selfe be frayle / weyke and voyd of all goodnes / except we be susteyned & maynteyned with the ryght hand of god / euyn like as a rede which is in it self voyd and weyke or shortly broken but holden in the hande of Christe: it is strengthed. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde haue a rede to be put in thy ryght hand scornfullye for a royall sceptre: I beseche the so to strength myne imbecillitie and fraylty with the ryght hande of thy power
that thy kyngdome maye be continually confirmed and stablis∣shed in me. Amen. ¶Howe the saugiours scornfully saluted Christe. The .xxxv. article. THe .xxv. article is the scornful worshippyng & salu∣tynge of Christe, for after that the saugiours hadde arayed Christe with the ornamentes of a kynge: they kneled downe before hym and mocked hym sa∣ynge:Mat. 27. D. Aue rex iudeorum: Hayle kyng of the Iues, as if they shuld say / thou wold haue ben a kynge but thou migh∣test not.Su{per} Mar. 15. And here sayth Bede: They worshypped hym scornful∣lye as god: bycause he sayde falslye hym selfe to be god as they thought. Also they saluted hym scornfully as a kynge bycause he sayde hym selfe to be a kynge, and this they dyd that theyr illu∣syon myght reanswere to the accusacyon of the Iues, for the Iu∣es accused Christ in both these .ii. Also these saugiours dyd these thynges to Christe of a detestable & dampnable mynde, for they crowned hym with sharp thornes and afterwarde scornfully wor¦shypped & saluted hym, and that to the great confusyon of Christ And therfore sayth Symon de Cassia:Libro. xiii. The ministers of Pylate to aggrauate and multiplye the vylenes & shame put vpon christ: dyd knele before hym, and besydes that: that they mocked hym after the maner of chyldren / they illuded hym with great threttes, so that nothyng wanted to the despysyng and the shame of christ, and in the remembrance of this despisyng, vpon good Friday we do not knele downe when we pray for the Iues, and though the gentyles dyd thus mocke Christe: yet it is imputed to the Iues for they were the autours and the cause of this illusion. After this scornfull salutacyon: they smote hym / as ye shall se in the nexte article.Gen. 9. D. This fourthe acte of the mockynge of Christe was figured in Noe when he slepte in his tabernacle: his sonne Cham dyd laughe hym to scorne. Noe dothe signyfye Christe / whome the Iues his owne chyldren dyd mocke and scorne. Al∣so it is figured in Heliseus the prophete / whiche ascendynge vn∣to the hyll of Bethell,Quarto re∣gum. 2. D. the chyldren that dyd se hym: dyd say and crye mockynge hym: Ascende calue ascende calue: Ascende or come vp thou balde man: ascende thou balde man. And of this mockyng speketh the {pro}phet Dauid sayng:Psal. 21. Omnes videntes me de riserunt me: Al that se me dyd mocke me / also ye {pro}phet Esay saith:
Blasphemauerūt sanctum Israel: They haue blasphemed the holy of Israell / that is the Messias and sauiour of the worlde. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne this lesson, that we shulde be ware yt we do not falsly worship or salute Christ / which we do (as Bede sayth) when we beleue in hym,Su{per} Mar. 15. but yet we despise hym with our euyl and froward dedes, when we confesse Christ with our mouth and denye hym in our dedes as sait Paule saith.Titū. 1. D. Also they falsly worshyp or salute Christe: whiche when they pray or be in the seruice of god: occupye theyr mynde wylfullye with any thyng contrarie to the honour of god. Also they which in the churche she we signes of greate deuocyon / and afterwarde do greuous iniuries to Christe in hys membres. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde be scornfully worshypped and saluted of the saugiours knelyng and saynge: Haile kyng of the Iues: graunte to me that I may worshyp the (my verye lorde and god) in spirite and treuth, and reuerentlye to salute the / the onelye kynge of all kynges. Amen. ¶Howe the saugiours smote Christe with theyr handes. The .xxxvi. article. THe .xxxvi. article is the smytynge of Christe / for these saugiours wyllynge to mocke Christe aswell in dedes: as in signes and wordes,Ioh. 19. A. Dabantei alapas: they smote hym with theyr palmes or handes, & that was to shewe in dede: that ye honor which they had done to hym before: was onely to mocke hym, and in this they made theyr mockyng / more to the despisyng of Christ, for before where as they dyd worshyp and reuerence to hym as to god / and dyd salute hym as a kynge / nowe they smote hym to his dispite & shame. And this smytyng is not that of which we spake before in ye .xi. article, for that was in the house of Annas / and thys was in the motehall of Pylate, also that was but one stroke whiche one of the ministers called Malcus dyd gyue to Christ / here were many strokes gyuen by diuers men to Christ. Thyrdly a Iee dyd gyue that stroke, but the saugiours & gentiles dyd gyue these. Fourthly yt stroke was gyuen to reuenge ye answere yt Christe made to ye bisshop Annas,
but these were gyuen onely to mocke Christ. And therfore this smytyng doth conueniently make a specyall article, diuers from the other, and after this they dyd spyr in his face as ye shall se in in the next article. The lessone we may take as in ye .xi. article. ¶A prayer. O Iesu which wold be smyten of the saugiours for me: make me euer to lande and prayse the both in word and dede / and also that the dedes of other men (thoughe they be euyll) maye euer torne to my good and profyte. Amen. ¶Howe the saugiours dyd spytte in the face of Christ. The .xxxvii. article. THe .xxxvii. article is the spyttynge of the saugiours in the face of Christe, whiche dyd moche aggrauate all theyr actes done before,Mat. 27. D. for what can be more vylanye to man: than to spyt in his face as dyd the saugiours in Christes face, lyke vyle and lewde persons. And herby ye may perceyue that thoughe these persons ben called in laten / milites, whiche comonly in englysshe we cal knyghtes / yet they were not knyghtes / that is gentyll and noble men / that be called also in la¦ten: Equites aurati, and that is for theyr golden spurres, for such gentyll men and noble persons wolde mocke no good man nor spytte in his face, nor yet crucifye hym and take his garmentes / whiche properly perteyneth to hangmen and tormentours. But these be called Milites, after the olde custome, seruantes / fotemen or saugiours / as it appereth in the lyfe / actes and gestes of Iu∣lius Cesar / where as Milites ben called fotemen / seruynge or hy¦red men that feyght on foot / and the knyghtes ben called horsmen These bene called / Milites,Vide Cale∣pinum et Suetoniū ī vita cesat̄. not for theyr noblenes: but for theyr strength. For comonly those saugiours were stronge in bodye and redye to all euyll.Sanctus Thomas. And of these speaketh Theophilus say∣enge:Su{per} Mar. 15. The vayne glorie of these saugyours in these mockynges / euer reioysynge in the inordynate rebukynges of other: done shewe what they be / that is vyle and lewde persons for the more parte of them, and this article is distincte from the .xvii. article, for that was done in the house of Cayphas before the Iues and of the Iues, but this spyttynge was in the motehall of Pylate, done by the saugiours before Pylate and all the compaygney.
Those were the spyttynges of the Iues, but these ware of the gentiles, and after this they smote Christe vpon the hed with a rede / as ye shall se in the next article. The lesson as in the .xvii. article. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me dyd suffer the vyle saugiours to spyt in thy most beautious face: graunt to me that I neuer polute or defoyle thy face in the sacrament of the aulte by my vnworthy receyuynge therof, and that I neuer defoyle my conscience with vnciene thoughtes. Amen. ¶Howe the saugiours smote Christ vpon the hed with a rede. The .xxxviii. article. THe .xxxviii. article is the smytynge vpon Christes hed with a rede, for his more payne and confusion / for vyle and stoborne persons are wonte to be smy∣ten with a staffe as bestes be. And also they smote Christ vpon the hed with a rede: to make ye crowne of thornes to go farther into his hed. And here note that ye redes in those partes ben great and grosse / as bygge or great as a staffe wherwith we beate dogges.Mar. 15. . The cruell saugiours smote Christ vpon the hed with a rede to his more rebuke & shame / as if they shulde say: O thou vyle & lewed felowe why woldest thou make thy selfe a kyng / and here they ordred Christe as theues and man∣sleyers be ordred with vs / for oftymes they be manycled to shewe and confesse what they haue done / and the harder they thurste the manycles ye more it is to theyr payn, and in lyke maner here they smote Christ{is} hed that was crowned with thornes / and yt to put hym to more payne. They smote with a rede that hed whiche is ferefull to all deuyls, reuerent to all the vertues & angelles of he∣uen, the most blessed hed of Christe which is to be worshypped of all sayntes for euer, from ye which hed cometh all blessyng and grace / not onely into our berde but also into the hem of our gar∣mentes, that is / not onely in to ye holy apostles & martyrs which be as the berde of Christe. But also his blessynge and grace descendeth in to all the membres of the churche thoughe they be but of verye small perfeccyon / all they that be the chyl∣derne of god: receyue this influens. O ye wretches howe fereful and terrible shall that hed apere to you at the day of iudgement:
whiche nowe ye be not afrayd to smyte? And with that smytyng the blode ranne downe from his hed: vpon his necke / forehed and face, and so he appered lyke vnto a lepre, for the pyttynges mix¦ted with that blode: made hym lyke vnto a lepre. And then Py∣late wente forth to the Iues. &c. as in the nexte article. ¶A Lesson. IN this article we may take this lesson, that we be well ware that we smyte not Christ{is} hed with a rede, as they do whiche impugne or denye his godhed, saynge that Christe is not god. Also they smyte Christe vpon the hed: whiche by theyr vayne and ydle lyfe offende Christe that is our hed, from whom cometh (as we said before) the influence of grace in to al his membres / wherby his membres haue their liue∣lye operations / and this hed hath gyuen to vs example of al our werkes. Wherfore in euery tyme that we haue any oportunitie to do any good: the ydle person that wyl not do that good worke doth in a maner smyte Christe vpon the hed, so that by that smy∣tynge and the prickynge of the thornes: the blode runneth from his hed / and nothynge to theyr comforth. And this it is yt Christ nowe soroweth / and is pricked vnto the sheddynge of blode for our ydylnes, for he seeth that his examples do not fructifye in vs for we wyll take no payne for Christe / nor do good werkes after his examples. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche wolde haue thy noble and precyous hed smy∣ten with a rede for me: graūt to me that I neuer offend the our hed with my vayne and ydle lyfe / but that I may euer please the with my good and quyete maners and lyuynge. Amen. ¶Howe Pylate dyd shewe Christe scourged vnto the Iues. The .xxxix. article. THe .xxxix. article is the shewyng of Christe so pitious∣lye arayed / vnto the Iues,Ioh. 19. A. for after that the saugiours had so miserably entreated our sauyour Christe: Py∣late toke Iesus and went forth vnto the people of the Iues & said to thē: Ecce adduco eū vobis foras vt cognoscatis quia nullā ī eo inuenio causā. Behold (sayd Pilate) I bryng him forth
to you thus punisshed for your wordes and to certifye you that I fynde no maner of cause of deth in hym, therfore he thus correct and punisshed:Libro. xiii. I shall dimisse hym. And here sayth Symon de Cassia: Pylate sayd that he found no cause of death in Christ, wherby he excludeth all crimes from Christe, for he bryngeth in an vniuersall negation / that is no cryme I fynde in Christ, and this he dyd for to shewe his diligēce for the deliuerance of Christ. And morouer Pylate dyd brynge forth Christe in the same habyt and aray: as he was illuded and mocked of the saugiours / and that was for the intent that the Iues seing hym so miserably and shamfully arayed: shulde cease of theyr malice towardes Christ. And also Pylate shewed Christ to the Iues on that maner: kno∣wynge that they wolde be very glad to se Christe thus dispysed and punisshed, and also supposyng yt therby they content / wolde no more speake of his deth, & for this cause Pylate dyd scourge Christ and shewed hym to the Iues, and therfore the euangelist sayth:Ioh. 19. A. Exiuit ergo Iesus portans spineam coronam et purpureum vestimentum: Iesus came forth hauyng a crowne of thornes and a purpull robe and also a rede in his hande for a scepter. Behold here a lamentable spectacle / Iesus went forth (as saynte Austen sayth) in a kynges ornamentes not glorious and shynyng in his apparell:Su{per} Iohn̄ tract. cxvi. but full of obprobry and confusyon.Vbi. supra. And therfore Py∣late sayd to the Iues: Ecce homo: Beholde this is a man / as yf he shulde haue sayd (after saynt Austen) If ye haue enuy to hym bycause he called hym selfe a kynge: nowe spare hym / haue pytie vpon hym, for ye nowe se hym lyke to no kynge but shamefullye and miserably deiecte lyke a moste miserable wretch, for he scour∣ged / crowned with thornes / mocked in a kynges ornamentes / despysed with many rebukes / and bet or smyten with many stro∣kes / therfore sith ye se hym thus dispised: let  enuy wax colde or cease. But for all these theyr enuy nothynge decreased: but ra∣ther encreased and waxed more hote and feruent. Se howe great is the malice of the Iues / that hereby wolde not cease of the pro¦curynge of the deth of Christe, theyr obstinate wickednes wold not be relented with mercye. And among all the other illusions: this was more payne to Christ, that is / that his deedly enemyes shuld se hym so dispytefully arayed of the saugiours, of ye which syght: they had no lytyl ioy, and yet they were not content with this syght: knowyng that Pilate wold haue so delyuered Christ to his libertie / but they hauynge no compassion of Christe / nor yet cōtent with the excusacyon of Pylate: cried out with a lowd
voyce and also moued other to crye sayng: Crucify hym: cruci∣fye hym. &c. as in the next article. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne to haue Christ thus illuded and mocked euermore in our remembraunce so that we neuer vaynly reioyse in our outwarde garment / habite / or apparel / for our lorde god was mocked and scorned in his apparell. And spe∣cyally religious persons ought to folowe Christe in this thyng / for they represent Christ thus illuded and mocked in theyr habyt and tonsure, for the habyt of a religiouse person is a vyle thynge despysed and mocked of the worldlye people. The tonsure or crowne of the religious person: doth represent ye crowne of thor¦nes. And also in olde tyme religious men as monkes were wont to beare staues or styckes in theyr handes whiche dyd represente the rede that Christe had in his hande, and as Christe disdeyned not to be brought forth and shewed to the Iues in that scornfull habite: so religious persons shulde not be ashamed of theyr vyle habit nor to folow Christ which was dispised in this kyng{is} aray. And herunto saynte Paule sayth,Pri co{rum}. 4. B. Spectaculum facti sumus mūdo: We that despyse the worlde: be made a mocken stocke vnto the worlde / and neuer so moche as in these dayes / our lorde sende vs pacyence, and lyghten the soules of the dispysers. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde be shewed and presented vnto the Iues in so scornfull and dispitefull aray: graunt me to auoyde all ostentation of vayne glorie / and to appere before the at thy iudgement in suche aray as shall stande with thy fauour. ¶Howe the Iues dyd crye / Crucifye hym / crucifye hym. The .xl. article. THe .xl. article is the cryenge of the Iues to haue Christ crucifyed, for when the bisshoppes and the other Iues had sene Christ so scornfully arayed / so miserably scour¦ged / bet and mocked / not content therwith / nor yet alo∣wynge the excusacyon of Pylate:Ioh. 19. A. dyd crye: Crucifige eum cruci∣fige eum: Crucifye hym / crucifye hym, they sayd twyse: Crucify
and that was to shewe theyr feruent desyre that they had to cruci∣fye Christe, and also for that they crucifyed hym both in wyl and in werke.Psal. 56. And as Rabanus sayth: It had ben more profitable to theyr soules to haue sayde: Miserere mei deus miserere mei: Haue mercy vpon me (O thou god) haue mercy vpon me, or els these wordes of the prophet Iohel:Iohel. 2. D Parce domine parce populo tuo: Spare lorde / spare thy people / gyue not thyne inheritance in to rebukes and confusion, let not the gentiles haue dominion vpon thy people the Iues, these prayers had ben more conueni∣ent for them: but they were so malicyous that they cryed / crucify crucifye hym, and when they cryed thus: it was the thyrde hour of the day / that is .ix. of the clocke after our computation. At that houre the Iues dyd crucifye Christ with theyr tongues. As saynt Austen sayth:Su{per} psal. 63. D and after this exposycyon the wordes of the euangeliste Marcus are to be vnderstanded where as he saythe:Mar. 15. C Erat autem hora tertia et crucifixerunt eum: It was ye thyrd hour of the day and the Iues dyd crucifye hym / that is with theyr ton∣gues. &c. openly shewynge therby that the tongues of the Iues were more to be sayd or called the sleyers of Christe than the han¦des of the saugiours. And therfore this crye is conueniently as∣signed a specyall article of the passion of Christe. They asked and cryed to haue Christe crucifyed, whiche maner of deth was at that tyme of suche shame and confusion: that after a persone ware put to suche a death: he shulde neuer be remembred and spo¦ken of agayne: but to his euyl and despisyng, and in a maner no man durst speake (specyally any good) of hym that was hanged vpon the crosse after his deth.Psal. 21. And of this complayneth Christe in the psalme saynge: Sicut aqua effusus sum: I am put out of mynde / as the water out of the vessel. Of all other liquores that be in a vessell, when they be put out of that vessell: there remay∣neth colour or smel, that sheweth / what liquor was before in that vessell, but whan water is put out of a vessell there remaynethe nothynge, wherby we myght knowe what liquor was in that vessell,Sapien. 2. D. so Christe saythe, that he is clerely forgoten. Also ye wise man sayth in the person of the Iues: Morte turpissima condemp∣nemus eum: Let vs condempne Christ to the most shameful deth. And the prophet Hieremy saith in the person of our lorde Christ:Hier. 11. D. Cogitauerunt super me consilia dicentes: venite mittamus lignum in panem eius: The malicyous Iues haue counseled agaynst me sayenge: Let vs put a tree in to his breade, that is / let vs cruci∣fye hym / and so he shalbe forgoten and dispysed of all people.
O thou faythful soule / behold here thy sauiour Iesus howe mise¦rably and scornfully clad and crowned: he is brought forth with a rede for his scepter in his hand, and how shamefastly he stādeth nowe with his heed downwarde, before suche a great multitude cryenge and sayenge: Crucifye / crucify hym / and also deridyng and mockynge hym, that he wolde be taken for a prophete and a wyse man sayenge: Where is nowe thy wysdome / thy pro∣phicye and miracles. &c. and so he not onely suffred payne and so∣rowe: but also rebukes and thretnynges of the Iues. Then Py∣late sayd to the Iues:Luc. 23. C. Quid enim mali fecit: What euyll hath he done, I fynde no cause of deth in hym. These wordes of Pylate done / instructe and teache all iudges to procede in all causes / and specyally in causes of deth: wysely and diligently. But alas where shall we fynde a iudge that wyll laboure so diligentlye for the delyuerance of an innocent: as Pylate dyd for Christe, and surely if Pylate were lyuyng in these dayes: I suppose he wolde excell in ryght iudgement many of our iudges both temporall and also spirituall. At that tyme the bisshoppes and seniours / and preestes and the religious / and all the people of the Iues were agaynste Christe, and Pylate lytyl regarded all theyr wor¦des, for he of a longe seasone▪ and oftymes laboured to delyuer Christe from them,Ioh. 19. A. and therfore he sayd: Accipite eum vos et cru cifigite: Take you hym and crucify hym: for I fynd no cause in hym. These wordes Pylate sayd for diuerse causes. Fyrst / af∣ter Symon de Cassia,Libro. xiii. to rebuke the pryde of the Iues which so farre dyd excede: that they determined and assigned vnto the pre¦sident and hyghe Iudge vnder the emperour, what deth Christe shulde suffer / that is the moste detestable and shamefull death of the crosse. Secondly Pylate spake these wordes / for to delyuer and acquyte the innocent Christe.Ome. 83. Su{per} Iohn̄ Herunto sayth Crisostome: The Iues brought christ to Pilate: yt he shuld be put & condēp∣ned to deth by the sentence of the iudge, but it happed ye cōtrary for the iudge declared Christ to be innocent, and oftymes he de∣lyuered and excused hym from theyr accusacyons. And that Py∣late sayd to the Iues: Take you hym and crucifye hym: was spoken in abhorryng theyr wordes, for that they wold haue com compelled hym to a thynge agaynst hys mynde and also agaynst ryght. Thyrdly he spake so for the declaracyon of his power and auctoritie / for he wolde gladly haue ben delyuered from the iud∣gement of Christe,Ioh. 19. B. the whiche the Iues perceyuyng: added the thyrd accusacyon besydes the other .ii. spoken in the .xxii. article
saynge: Nos legem habemus: et secūdum legem debet mori: quia fi∣lium dei se fecit: We haue a lawe after the which he ought to dye / for he hath made hym selfe the sonne of god.Libro. xiii. And here as Sy∣mon de Cassia sayth: It apereth manifestly the falsenes of theyr accusacyon, for if the wordes shulde be referred to theyr intent, or contrarie wyse if theyr intent shuld agre to theyr wordes, both wayes: the Iues do lye and theyr iniquitie doth lye and speake false to themselfes, for Christ dyd neuer make hym selfe god, no∣ther in this worlde: nor yet eternally, for he was god euerlas∣tyngly / not made / but eternally generate and goten of the father, but the Iues thought Christ to be onely a man and not god, nor Christe at any tyme as man / dyd affirme hym selfe to be made the sonne of god but for asmoche as he beynge the eterne sonne of god / was made man for vs / his godhed in no thynge chaunged, but takynge for our saluation / our nature: therfore he called him self the sonne of god / for he was both god and man in one person, but Pilate when he had herd this sayng of ye Iues:Ioh. 19. B. he was more afrayd than he was before, not for that he feared theyr lawe: but that he was afrayd to condempne the sonne of god. And also he was afrayd hearynge suche a hyghe sentence / that was aboue his witte and vnderstandyng / that is that a man shulde be or make hym selfe the sonne of god, and whether it were true or not: he was afrayd to gyue sentence of deth.Su{per} Iohn̄ 19. And herto sayth Alquine: He dyd not feare for that he harde them speake of theyr lawe, for he beynge a straunger and a gentill / regarded not that / but he was afrayd to cōdempne the sonne of god, and therfore he entred in agayne in to the motehall and callynge Iesus vnto hym sayd: Vnde es tu?Ioh. 19. B. Of what stocke or kyndred art thou? Pylate wolde haue knowen if he were the sonne of god / or if he were of the kynd or stocke of ye goddes. And this laste poynte myght haue bene easely or lyghtlye persuaded vnto Pylate, for he was a gentill: which do suppose and beleue that many men may be of the stocke of goddes / and so the sonne of goddes. But Iesus dyd not an∣swere one worde to his question, and that was bycause Pylate was not sufficient to receyue or vnderstande the solution of hys awne question.Esae. 53. C For the prophet sayth: Generationem eius quis enerrabit? Who is able to declare and shewe his eterne genera∣tion? and though Christ was able to declare it: yet there is no mortall man able to vnderstande it. Secondly Iesus wolde not answere to Pylates question: that Pylates synne shulde not be aggrauate and made more greuous. And thirdly that the passion
of Christe shulde not be letted.Pri co{rum}. 2. B. For as saynt Paule sayth, Si cog nouissent: nun{quam} dominum glorie crucifixissent: If they had kno∣wen (howe Christe was the sonne of god) they wold neuer haue crucifyed the lorde of glorie, and this is to be vnderstand of Py¦late and ye gentyles & not of the Iues, for they myght haue kno∣wen sufficiently if they had wolde.Ioh. 19. B. Then Pylate sayd to Christ: Mihi non loqueris, Nescis quia potestatem habeo crucifigere te. &c Why wylt not thou speake to me? dost thou not knowe yt I haue power to crucifye the / or to dimisse and delyuer the? In these wordes Pylate cōdempneth hym selfe.Omel. 83. Su{per} Iohn̄ And therfore Chrisostom sayth: O Pylate in this worde thou condempnest thy selfe, If thou haue this power: wherfore then dost not thou delyuer hym thou knowyng and so oftymes openly sayng that he is innocent? If thou reioyse or bost thy selfe of thy power that thou haste to kyll Christe or to delyuer hym: may not Christ then laufully say vnto the:Luc. 19. D. De ore tuo te iudico serue nequam: I iudge the by thyne owne wordes / thou wycked seruant? and then Iesus to reproue the bostynge and pryde of Pylate sayd:Ioh. 19. B. Non haberes aduersū me potestatem vllam: nisi datum tibi esset de super: Thou shulde haue no power ouer me: except it were gyuen to ye from aboue or from an hygher power. Fyrste from god: of whome is all power, as saynt Paule sayth.Rom̄. 13. A. And secondly from the emperour, which at that tyme had the dominion ouer the Iues. And in these wordes Christ reproueth couertly or secretly the synne of Pylate, for no∣ther god, nor yet the emperour had ordred Pylate there a iudge to condempne or punisshe the innocentes / but rather to defende and delyuer them. And notwithstandyng the synne of Pylate was great: yet it was not so greuous as the synne of the Iues or of Iudas. And this our lord sheweth in the wordes folowyng: Propteria qui tradidit me tibi:Ioh. 19. B. maius peccatum habet: Therfore he that dyd betray or delyuer me vnto the: his synne is the more great and greuous, and that well apereth, for Iudas dyd synne moued of a couityse mynde, the Iues synned: moued of malyce and enuy, but Pylate: onely for feare of the emperour & fauour of ye Iues. It is more greuous offēce to sinne of a couetyse mind and of rancor and enuy: than onely of feare, for feare accusethe the synne in a parte / though not in the hole, and here Pylate con¦sideryng that he was reasonably in a maner conuicte of synne in this cause: for he (as a wytty person) perceyuynge that he shuld be noted of synne / if he shulde condempne the innocent: therfore he sought oportunitie and occasion to dimisse and lette hym go,
as he dyd before / in sendyng Christ to Herode, and also in sayng that he founde no cause of deth in hym. But the Iues anone per∣ceyuyng the mynde of Pylate: returned to theyr first accusacyon and cryed saynge: Si hunc dimittis non es amicus cesaris: If thou dimisse this man thou art not true to the emperour. &c. as in the next article shal apere. And here note that there ware about. lxxx. M. people that cryed: Crucifige: crucifige: Of the whiche Peter conuerted in one day .iii. M. & shortly after .v. M. vnto ye fayth. ¶Here folowe .ii. Lessons IN this article we may take first this lesson, it is no dif∣ference or diuersitie (to speake of the intente of synne) whether thou kyll a man with thy tongue / or with thy swerde, for thy intent in both these .ii. is to kyll hym. And therfore the profyte Dauid sayth:Psal. 56. Lingua eorum gladius acu tus: Theyr tongue is a sharpe swerde, and this was spoken of the Iues that dyd cry:Ioh. 19. A. Crucifige crucifige: And of this text saint Austen sayth:Su{per} Iohn̄ trac. 114. & su{per} psal. 63. Loke not vnto the vnarmed handes of the Iues: but to theyr armed mouth, for frome thens came yt sharpe swerde that slewe Christ. Therfore lette all bacbyters and sclaunderers of theyr neyghbours beware that they do not make theyr tonges sharpe as a swerde / for as a swerde kylleth the body: so the sclaū∣derer tongue sleyeth the fame and good name of a man.Prouer. 18. D. And her∣to sayth Salomon: Mors et vita in manibus lingue: Deth & lyfe be in the handes or power of the tongue. The seconde lessone is that we shuld not alwayes answere to euery question, for here in this passyon of Christe: we rede that thryes he kepte his sci∣lence. Fyrst before the bisshop / and that was to teache vs pacy∣ence agaynst contumelyes and rebukes. Secondly before He∣rode / and that was agaynst curiouse questyons to teache vs for to serch for true and necessarie thynges and not for vayne & curi∣ous thynges. Thyrdly before Pylate / agaynste vayne laude or prayse / to teache vs to folowe the true laude of god and to auoyd all vayne praysynges. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article shulde remember howe terrible ware those cryenges of the Iues. And remēber also if he at any tyme hath cryed agaynst his neyghbour by consent vnto the wicked iudgementes of men / or to theyr detraccyons & sclaunders spoken agaynst theyr neygh¦bour. And then pray as foloweth or in lyke maner. ¶A prayer:
O Iesu whiche for me was not afrayd to here the terrible and fearfull voyces of the Iues cryenge: Crucifige: crucifige: That is crucifye hym / crucifye hym: graunt to me that I be not afrayd of the cursed and malicyous word{is} of myne enemyes / and that I neuer hurt my neyghbour with my speche. Amen. ¶Howe Christe was brought vnto his iudgement. The .xli. article. THe .xli.Ioh. 19. B. article is the bryngynge of Christe before the iudge / for when the Iues dyd perceyue yt Pylate wold haue delyuered Christe: they returned to theyr fyrste accusacyon and cryenge sayd: Si hunc dimittis: non es amicus cesaris: If thou delyuer this person thou art not the frend of the emperoure nor true to hym, for who so euer maketh hym selfe a kyng: he is a traytour to the emperour. This they spake to make Pylate afrayde,Libro. xiii. and here sayth Symon de Cassia that the Iues serched all the false craftes and deuyses that they could ymagyne,Su{per} Iohn̄ trac. C.xvi. and all to put Christe vnto the deth. And then Pylate hearynge these wordes beganne to be more afrayd, for he myght not contempne the emperour that gaue hym his power and auc∣toritie as sayth saīt Austen.Ioh. 19. C. And therfore he brought Iesus forth and sat downe to gyue sentence / openly, and this he dyd that the sentence of Christes dth shuld not be imputed to hym / but to the Iues. And when Pylate sat downe to gyue sentence: it was the syxte houre of the day that is .xii.Mat. 27. B of the clocke. And then his wyfe sent to hym saynge: Nihil tibi et iusto illi, Mel not thou with the deth of that rightuous man,Glos ordin̄ Su{per} Mat. 27. this night I haue suffred many thin¦ges in my slepe about hym, for as the glose saith there: the deuyl perceyuynge that he shuld lese his kyngdom & power by the deth of Christ: was sory that he made Christ to be taken, and therfore he shewed certen visions to Pylates wyfe, that by her the death of Christ shulde be letted, as in the begynnynge he brought deth in to the worlde by a woman. Then Pylate commaunded that Iesus shulde be presented before hym where as he sat in iudge∣ment and then he sayd to the Iues:Ioh. 19. C. Ecce rex vester: Behold your kynge / before he sayd: Beholde a man, therby shewynge howe shamefullye and miserably Christ was arayed, and that Pylate spake to moue the Iues to compassion. And nowe to moue them agayne: he sayd scornfully mockynge them: behold your kynge / as if he shulde saye: ye awght to be ashamed / that any wyse man
shuld perceyue that ye be afrayd that this simple person, so vyle∣ly abiecte and despised / shuld be your kynge / but the Iues in no¦thynge ashamed nor yet moued to pitie:Ibidem. cryed, Tolle tolle cruci∣fige eum: Away with hym hens with hym / take hym frome our syght, it is deth for vs to loke vpon hym, away with hym / cru∣cify hym. And note here that they dyd crye thrice: Crucify hym and in the remembraunce therof we say thryce / Agnus dei / in the masse.Ibidem. Then Pylate scornfully sayd to them: Regem vestrum cru cifigam? Shall I crucifye your kynge? wyllynge therby to re∣buke them and make theym ashamed to speake any more therof, whom he coulde not moue by the despysynges of Christe / but the Iues past all shame answered saynge:Ibidem. Non habemus regem nisi cesarem: We haue no kyng but the emperour. And herby ye may se howe moche the vnkynde Iues desyred the deth of Christe / for they to procure his deth wylfully submitted them selfe vnder the subieccyon of the Romaynes, the whiche before that tyme they wolde neuer gladly do, but rather they were alwayes in a mynde and purpose to rebelle agaynste the emperour for to haue theyr li∣bertye. And here note that this article was more greuous to Christe / then any of the other before: for here he was broughte to his iudgement and his accusars moste cruelly dyd crye / away with hym / hange hym vpon the gallowes. &c. where as all the other were done and spoken, the iudge not syttynge in iudge∣mente. And then Pylate seynge that that he myght in no thyng profyte to the delyueraunce of Chrste called for water. &c. as shall appere in the nexte article. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne howe to iudge oure selfe in our owne soule and conscience / as Christe was iudged for vs, that therby we myghte auoyde the strayte iudgemente of god. For as saynte Paule saythe:Prim̄ co. 11. G. If we here iudge our selfe: we shall not be Iudged. ¶A prayer. O Lorde Iesu Christe the sonne of the lyuynge god whiche in the syxte houre of the day wold for me most wretched sin¦ner / be presented before the iudge syttyng in iudgement: graunt to me so to iudge my selfe in my selfe of all my synnes / by the testy¦monie
or witnes of myne owne conscience / and also pacyentlye to suffer thy iudgemente in all aduersities: that I may in suerty appere in thy laste and terrible iudgement. Amen. ¶Howe Christe was condempned. The .xlii. article. THe .xlii. article is the condempnacyon of Christ by the sentence of the iudge,Su{per} Iohn̄ 19. for Pylate seynge that he in no¦thyng profyted for the delyuerance of Christ, but that more busines was made / for as the glose sayth: The Iues reputed to Pylate treason and rebellion agaynst the empe∣rour, he was anone ouercome by feare / ād swerued from the way of treuth and iustice.Mat. 27. C But fyrst he toke water and wasshed hys handes sayng: Innocens ego sum a sanguine iusti huius: vos vide∣ritis:Psal. 25. I am innocent of the blode and deth of this iust person / Py¦late toke water and wasshed his handes accordyng to the sayeng of the {pro}phet: Lauabo inter innocentes manus meas: I shal wassh my handes among the innocentes, but he sayd to the Iues: Vos videritis: Loke you to your parte / cōsider what shalbe your syn. I am the minister of the lawe, take good hede whom ye offer to me to be slayne, for I must gyue sentence after your sayng{is} / and not after my knoledge and mynde / and therfore this synne shalbe imputed to you and not to me.Mat. 27. C And then all the people of the Iu¦es answered and sayd: Sanguis ei{us} super nos et super filios nostros, His blode fall vpon vs & vpon our childern. This sayng / for the wordes is very good & most {pro}fitable to man saluacyon / for it is greatly to be desired that the blode of Christ fal vpon vs to wassh vs from all fylth of synne / accordyng to the sayng of saynt Iohan Dilexit nos et lauit nos a peccatis nostris in sanguine suo:Apoc. 1. B. Christe hath loued vs & wasshed vs frome our synnes in his blode. But the Iues spake these wordes with an other intent, for they desy∣red yt the vengeance of his blode and deth shulde fall vpon them and vpon theyr children,Su{per} Mat. 27. and so it doth vnto this day yt is almost xv, hūdreth yeres & so shal cōtinue (as saint Hierom saith) nygh vnto the ende of the worlde. And so pylate thought he had sayd before and declared Christ to be innocent / and so to be delyuered, yet nowe wyllyng to please the Iues / and sacysfye theyr cryeng{is} and fulfyll theyr wyl / dyd yt thyng which was not plesyng to god and accordynge to iustyce. Also fearynge that he shulde haue bene accused of treason agaynst the emperour. Also supposynge no great peryll or daunger / though he condempned to deth this
pore innocent person, specyally considerynge that no man spake or intreated for hym, al this considered (I say) Pylate gaue sen¦tence and iudged Christe, for that he wolde haue ben a kyng con¦trarie to the precepte of the emperour: to be hanged vpon ye crosse or crucifyed, and this sentence was agaynst all iustyce, and also agaynste his owne knowledge, for he knewe Christe to be inno∣cent in this cause and all other. And thus he gaue most cruel sen¦tence agaynste the innocent in whome was no cause of deth. And so by his iudgement and power of the emperoure: he betoke Ie¦sus vnto the Iues that he shulde be crucifyed. And note here that the euangelist sayth not (Vt crucifigerēt eū:Mat. 27. C sed vt crucifigeretur) That the Iues shulde crucifye Christe, but that he shulde be cru¦cified by the auctoritie of the iudge, but he sayth that Pylate be∣toke Iesus vnto the Iues: to shewe that they were the cause of his deth / though they wolde not haue had it so taken, for Pylate wold not haue gyuen this sentence / but onely for that he se that he coulde none otherwyse please and content the Iues. But what was the forme and the wordes of the sentence: it is not shewed in the gospelles: but in the euangely of Nichodeme it is writen howe that Pylate gaue sentence in these wordes folowyng / Gens tua comprobauit te regem: propterea precipio te primum flagellari secundum principum statuta deinde  cruce leuari: Thy people haue affermed the to be a kynge, therfore I commaunde the first to be scourged accordyngly to the ordynaūces and statutes of the princes of Rome and after that to be hanged vpon the crosse. Be¦holde here howe the moste innocente lambe Christe dyd chose to be dampned for the with an vniuste and false sentence to dely∣uer the frome the iudgement of iustyce and payne of eternall dampnacyon, he payed for that he neuer had he suffred payne for oure synne. And here remember what lamentacyon his fren∣des then made, when they herde this horrible and moste vntrue sentence gyuen agaynste Christe. And in the remembraunce of that sentence and deth of Christe / whiche in scripture is cal∣led Alpha and Oo,Apoc. 1. B. the begynnynge and the endynge, and by∣cause that Christe was that daye taken frome vs by his death. Therfore the churche euery yere in that day vseth to omitte and leaue the begynnynge and endynge of the houres of the seruyce. After this condempnacyon: the saugiours toke oure sauyoure Iesus. &c. as in the nexte article. ¶A Lesson.
BY this article we may lerne to be ware that we neuer wor∣thely deserue the iust sentence of deth / nother of the soule / nor of the bodye. And also as Christe suffred for vs a false and a wicked sentence to be gyuen agaynst hym by a frayle man: so in lyke maner we shulde not feare the wicked iudgementes of men gyuen or spoken agaynst vs,Prim̄ co. 4. A. but pacyētly suffer them for the loue of god. And herunto sayth saynt Poule, Mihi autem pro minimo est vt a vobis iudicer: aut ab humano die, I do lytyll regarde to be iudged of you or of any mannes day. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde pacyently and innocently suffer the vniust sentence of deth: and that of the most shamefull deth of the crosse: graunt to me that I neuer deserue the iust sen∣tence of deth in soul or in bodye / and that for thy loue I feare not the wicked iudgementes of men, and also that I neuer iudge a∣ny persone wrongfullye. Amen. ¶Howe Christe bare his crosse. The .xliii. article. THe .xliii. article is the bearynge of his crosse, for after that Pylate had gyuen sentēce of deth agaynst the innocent Christ Iesus:Mat. 27. D. then the saugiours toke hym and pulled of the purpull or scarlet robe, and put on hym his owne garmentes. And here saythe Symon de Cassia:Libro. xiii. When Christe shulde be crucifyed then the saugiours toke from hym that garment wherin they had derided and mocked hym, and nowe they beganne (not mockyngly or in sporte / but in verye dede) to put hym to the payne and deth of the crosse / and therfore they put vpon hym his owne garmentes / that therby he myght be the more knowen, and so goynge to his deth in his owne clothes: it shulde be the more to his confusyon and shame. And at this tyme without any doubte Christe suffred a newe payne and that was moste greuous / for that olde purpull robe was harde baken and cleued faste to his backe, in the woū∣des whiche he suffred before at his scourgynge, and therfore this robe myght not be pulled of his backe: but to his most greuous payne, for they rent and pulled the flesshe frome his bodye with that cote, and so put Christ, to a newe & intollerable payne agayn.
Then they byndynge his handes and necke with a rope: therby shewed that he was cōdempned vnto the deth, and so drewe hym out of his propre citie as a misdoer, and they layde the great / he∣uy and grosse tree of the crosse / vpon his moste soore and tender sholders, that he shulde beare it vnto the place where as he shuld be crucifyed. And for asmoche as that tree was reputed and thought of the Iues to be a prophane and vnclene thynge: and also that deth of the crosse shamefull / for the scripture sayth:Deut. 21. D Ma ledictus omnis qui pendit in ligno: He is a cursed that is hanged vpon a tree, therfore no man durst beare that tree not yet touche it. And for this cause: they leyde it vpon Christe, that he damp∣ned: shulde beare his owne crosse.Ioh. 19. D. This was a great ioye and sporre to the wicked men, but it was a great misterie to vs chris∣tians. And therfore saynt Barnarde sayth: O here is spectacle or thynge done that was neuer sene before / neuer herde nor done before, that a thefe or a malefactour shulde be compelled to beare the gallowes or tree wherupon he shulde be hanged / but onelye now in Christ? And here sayth saynt Austen: The mylde lambe Iesus taketh and beareth his owne crosse vpon his sholders go∣ynge with great payne and sorowe vnto the place of his passyon,Esaie. 9. B. and herin was fulfylled the saynge of the prophet: Factus est ptin cipatus super humeum eius: His dignitie and power is made v∣pon his shoulder, his crosse: is his dignitie and power, wherby he dyd ouercome the power of the deule, and for his obedience vn¦to the deth:Philip 2. B god dyd exalte hym as saynte Poule sayth. And as greate men beare diuers thynges in token of theyr diuers digni¦ties, As kynges: a crowne, bisshoppes a myter, other men a gartar. &c. so Christe in the remembraunce of his dignitie: bare the crosse, and so thou serchynge: shal not fynde or perceyue that Iesus reigneth in any person: but by payne & herdnes / and ther∣fore these delicates & carnall persons whiche wyl suffer no payne but folowe all pleasure: ben the enemyes of the crosse of Christe as saīt Austen saith.Gen. 22. B In this acte was fulfylled ye figure of Isaac whiche bare the stickes wherwith he shulde haue bene offered to god in sacrifice.Tertio re∣gum. 17. B. Also this acte was figured in the wydowe of Sareptha that gatherd .ii. stickes.Nū. 13. C. Also our sauyour Christe is signifyed by that clustre of grapes that was borne vpon a tre by∣twixte. ii. men, for Christe was hanged vpon a tre bytwixt two theuys. Also this Christe is signifyed by Helyseus whiche kut downe a tre and went with it to searche for the yren whiche was fallen in to the watre, and at that searchynge: the yren swame
aboue the water / where as the tree was, so our sauiour Christe saught for man kynde whiche was fallen in to the deape water of troubles and drowned synne / and in hell, but by the tree of the crosse of Christe: it swame vp agayne and so was recouered a∣gayne. Of this article saynt Anselme sayth: O my soule behold and se howe thy lorde god is in al thynges here despised and com¦pelled to bowe his backe vnder the heuye burden of the crosse / and so to beare his owne confusion and shame. O merueylouse spectacle to beholde doste thou not se hym? beholde his dignitie and power is shewed vpon his sholder,Psal. 44. this is the rodde or tree of equitie, the tree of his kyngdome and power. And thus when Iesus had gone a lytyll forth bearynge his heuy crosse: he was so feynt & wery, partly for feblenes and tendernes of his bodye, and partly for the great afflicacyon and payne that he had suffred all the same day and nyght before: that he was fayne to go softly and also to lay downe the crosse from hym, or els (as some sayth) he fel downe vnder the crosse there to ret hym and ease hym self. But those moste cruell tormentours not wyllynge to differ hys deth, and also fearynge lesse that Pylate shulde reuoke his sen∣tence bycause he shewed hym selfe to haue a good wyll to delyuer Christ from deth, therfore they constrayned a straunge man that passed by them called Symon Cireneus to beare the crosse after Iesus.Mar. 15. B Not moued (as the glose sayth) of any pitye or mercye towardes Christ:Glosa ordi Ibidem. but that he myght the soner come to his death. And also that it myght appere that Iesus was not god / seynge that he was so feble & weyke a man that he was not able to beare that crosse as sayth saynt Austen. And this Symon was not a Iue or of the chylderne of Israell: but a pylgryme a straunger of the Sirenys that is a cytye in the countrie of Libia. And in this man was veryfyed the saynge of the prophet Dauid:Psal. 17. Popu lus quē non cognoui: seruiuit mihi: The people that I haue not knowen: hath done seruice to me. And though the iues put this labour (that is to beare the crosse after Iesus) vnto this Symon as to a vyle person & despysed among{is} them: yet it was not done without great misterie,Glos ordi Su{per} Mar. 15. &. Mat. 27. for as the glose sayth: Beholde and note here / that no Iue or Ebrewe: but a straunger / a gentyle is sub∣dued to the obprobry and crosse of Christe, to shewe that the plen¦tuousnes of grace & of the sacramentes or misteries of the lawe shulde departe from the Iues vnto the gentyles. Symon is as moche to say by interpretation as obedient,Beda. Su{per} Lucā. 23. and Cireneus is in∣terpreted: heres / that is an heyre. And therfore by this man may
be well noted all good christians conuerted frome the erroure of gentilitie vnto Christe: whiche somtyme ware as pylgryms or straungers vnto the lawe and preceptes of god, but by theyr faith and obedyence vnto the cōmaundemētes of god: they were made of the housholde of god and his heyres / and also coenheritours with Christe. And thus bearynge his crosse: they brought hym to Golgotha. &c. as in the nexte article. ¶A Lesson. IN this article we christians maye lerne to beare the crosse after Iesus for (as the glose sayth) Firste Christe beareth the crosse / for he suffred first,Su{per} Mat. 27. &. Mar. 15. afterwarde it was put to Symon Cireneus to beare it after Christ / for we ought to folowe the step¦pes of Christ, for Symon dyd folowe we and not go before Christ. And herunto our lord sayth in the gospell:Luce. 9. C. Si quis vult venire post me: tollat crucem suam quotidie et sequatur me: If any man wyll come after me: lette hym take his owne crosse dayly and folowe me. And here be noted thre thynges, necessary for hym that wyl folowe Christ. Fyrst that he beare it voluntarylye and not com∣pelled agaynst his wyll, and therfore he sayth: If any man wyll come after me: notynge therby that it muste be of his owne wyll. Seconde that he beare his owne propre crosse / and therfore / he sayth let hym take his owne crosse. Thyrde that it be done for the glorie of god / and not for vayne glorie, and therfore he sayth and folowe me / do it to my honour and for my loue. And by this crosse here is noted the purpose of godly and vertuouse lyfe, so that the hole lyfe of a christiane whiche lyueth after the gospell of Christ may be called a crosse and a martirdome. And this crosse is to be dayly borne after Christe, and for the loue of Christe. Fyrste in our hert by remēbraunce and compassion. In our mouth by ofte and deuoute thankes. And in our bodie by discreate / chastysyng and subduynge of the same, that so we myght reanswere & gyue thankes vnto our sauiour in hert / worde / and dede. Herby ye may se that loue without this crosse / nor yet this crosse without loue: may deserue any laude or prayse in thought / worde / nor dede. But that crosse is hyghely to be praysed whiche is ioyned with loue / whiche loue also the same crosse doth brynge in. In this state was saynt Paule whiche sayd of hymselfe:Gala. 2. D. Christo con fixus sum cruci: I am fastened to the crosse for the loue of Christ. In this crosse fyrst our flesshe or body is fastened with the nayles
of feare and hexunto the prophet Dauid sayth:Psal. C. 18. Cōfige timore tuo carnes meas: Fasten or nayle faste my flesshe with thy feare. Se∣condly our spirite muste be fastened with the nayles of loue. And thyrdly our outwarde senses: with the nayles of disciplyne and rigour or payne.Eccl. 12. D. And herunto the wyse man sayth: Verba sapien cium quasi stimuli: et quasi claui in altum confixi: The wordes of wyse men be as pryckes or broddes, and as nayles fastened in the profunditie of our senses. Fourthly our handes must be nayled with the nayles of laboure. And therfore the wyse man sayth: Quodcun{que} potest manus tua:Eccle. 9. C. instanter operare: Werke diligently what so euer good thy handes may werke. Herby it doth clerely appere: that that person sheweth hym selfe manifestly to haue no true loue: whiche wyll not prepare and gyue hym selfe to harde and paynfull thynges for his louer. O howe gladlye ought the christians to take and beare his crosse, syth he is taught and mo∣ued therunto by nature and also by crafte. Naturally the byr∣des when they flye in the ayre: they vse the signe of the crosse / for theyr hed and theyr tayle and theyr winges abrode: make a crosse, and so in theyr flyenge they take theyr crosse. In lyke maner a man swymmynge takes his crosse. The shyppe goyng vpon the see: maketh the signe of the crosse. Also a man to conforme hym selfe to this article shuld remēber with how great charitie Christ bare his crosse for vs, and of what heuynes it was to hym, se∣ynge that all the synnes of the worlde was put vpon his crosse, whiche all: this swete and mylde lambe whome he went to be of∣fered: dyd beare vpon his shoulders. Also a man may ymagyne in hym selfe as if he bare the crosse of Christe with hym as Sy∣mon Cireneus dyd, and so pray thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me a wretche wolde beare thy heuy crosse vpon thyne owne shulders: make me wilfully and gladlye to take the crosse of penance and streyter lyfe / and to beare it day∣lye after the and for thy loue. Amen. ¶Howe Christ was led vnto Golgoltha that is the mount of Caluarie. The .xliiii. article. THe .xliiii. article is the ledynge of Christe vnto Golgo∣tha, there to be crucifyed, for after that they had layde the crosse vpon Christes shulders and there tyed it fast. As saynt Iohan sayth:Ioh. 19. D. Eduxerunt eum: They led hym out of the citie. Fyrste to fulfyll the fygures of the lawe. For it
was commaunded in the lawe that the calfe and the gote / whiche were ored in the moste solempne sacrifice for the expiation and purifyeng of the people:Leui. 9 & 10. that they shulde be buryed without the castelles or the habitacyons of men. So Christe whiche is the sacrifice for the expiation and redēption of all man kynde: shulde suffer deth without the castels or cities. And also he wolde suffer without ye citie to declare & shewe vnto vs howe yt the vertue of his passion shuld not be included within the coostes or boūdes of the Iues: but that it shuld be knowen to be a comon sacrifice for all the worlde. And thyrdly to signifye and shewe to vs / that who so wolde haue the effecte and vertue of this passion: he muste go forth / or go from the worlde / at lest in desire / affeccyon / or loue that is: that he haue no inordinate loue to the worlde, the good∣des or pleasure therof. Wherfore let vs folowe Christe and go vnto hym frome our carnall frendes and worldlye conuersacyon bearynge with hym and for his loue rebukes and sharp paynes. And herunto saynt Bernarde sayth: Christe suffred his passyon and deth without the citye, therfore let vs go to hym from the cy∣tye, that is by the contempte of worldlye conuersacyon, and that may be done by .iii. maner of wayes. In affeccyon or loue / that we loue not inordinatly the world. In effect & dede: that we vt∣terly forsake the worlde both in wyll and also bodye. And thyrd∣lye by profytynge: that we desyre and labour to be made one spi∣rite with god. For as saynt Gregorie sayth: The more that a man is separate from the loue of the worlde: the more nygh he is to god. This ledyng aboue al the other .viii. of which we spake in the .viii. article: was most paynfull and shamefull to Christe and that for many causes, and therfore conueniently it maketh a specyall article. Fyrst by reason of his rebuke and shame / for it was moche shamefull to be led vnto hangynge. Secondly, for that he was copled and ioyned or led with .ii. theues and mische∣uous persons / and that was done to his more confusyon & shame that the people shulde thynke / there was no difference bytwixte Christe and them. Thyrdly for the greate noumber of people that se hym and folowed hym / and that not onely of men but also of women as the euangelist sayth.Luc. 23. D. But they all dyd not folowe hym of one intent and one mynde / for some were moche ioyfull of that syght / as the moste parte of the Iues. And it is no small payne to a man to behold and se other men, and specially his ene¦myes gladde and ioyfull of his affliccyon and rebuke. There were also some that dyd wepe and were sorye for that syght, as
the blessed woman. And also this was moche paynfull to Christ to se his frendes & louers in sorowe and heuynes for hym.In libro de planctu vir¦ginis. Saint Bernarde describeth this ledynge and procession in this maner folowynge. When Christ (sayth he) was broughte forthe to be ledde vnto his passion: there was gathered about hym a greate multitude of people, as ye comonly se: when theues and mur∣derars be had to hangynge. Some went saughynge / and some cast clay or durte vpon his most blessed hed and face. If Christe loked before hym / he sawe them cast durte vpon hym. If he lo∣ked aboue hym: he sawe the heuy tre of the crosse lyenge vpon his necke and greuously oppressed hym. If he loke behynd hym he sawe his mother with a great nomber of men and women we∣pynge and lamentynge for hym. And as some doctours do say / his most sorowefull mother wolde haue come to hym to haue hel¦pen hym: and myght not be suffred / the whiche her swete Iesus seynge and consederynge her great heuynes: fell downe for so∣rowe and werynes vnder the crosse. And that seynge his moste louynge mother: for sorowe she fell to the erth as deade. And in the remembraunce of this swonyng there was afterwarde a cha¦pell buylded by the faythful people in the same place in the honor of our lady whiche is called: sancta Maria de Spamo. and after this:Luc. 23. D. Iesus turnynge hym selfe to the women that wepte: sayd, Filie Hierusalem nolite flere super me: sed super vosipsas flete et super filios vestros: O ye doughters of Hierusalem wepe not vpon me for I take these paynes and deth with my good wyll, for it is the wyll and ordinaunce of god my father / that I shulde thus dye, and also for the great profet yt shall come therof to man¦kynde, for by my deth I wyll ouercome euerlastynge deth, but wepe for the cause of my passyon and dethe, that is: the synnes of the people which cause me to suffer deth by the order of iustice. And thus to wepe: it is necessarie for you, and therfore it folo∣weth: Sed super vosipsas flete: et super filios vestros: But weape for your selfes and for your chylderne. Herin Christ doth not re∣buke theyr affeccyon and compassyon that they had to hym: but he doth teche them an order howe to wepe, that is firste to wepe for them selfe and theyrs, for it is a vayne thyng and of no profyt to wepe for the passyon of Christ: and therwith to despyse hym with our euyl dedes and lyuyng. Also he byddes them that wepe for hym: to consider what paynes be lyke to fal vpon them selfe, And therfore they shuld wepe for them self and for theyr childern, and therfore Christe saythe:Luc. 23. D. Quoniam ecce venient dies in quibus
dicent:Luc. 23. D. beate steriles. &c. For the dayes shall come (sayth Christ) when they shall say: Blessed and happy be the baren and tho that brought forthe no fruyte, and those pappes or teates be happye that neuer gaue sucke or mylke, then they shall begynne to saye to the mowntes: Fal vpon vs, and to the hylles: Couer vs. And thsi he spake for the tyme of the seage of Hierusalem by the em∣perours Vaspasyan and Titus his son, for then the Iues were in great distresse as it appereth by the histories of Iosephus and Egesippus, or els we may say that Christe spake this for the ex∣treme and last day of iudgement. And the cause or reason of both these he addeth and sayth: Quia si in viridi ligno faciunt: in arido quid fiet? For sithe so greuous paynes and shamefull despites be done to me whiche am a grene tree florisshyng and quicke in the roote of my diuinitie / in the charitie of my manhode / in the bran∣ches of my vertues / in the leeses of good wordes / and the fruyte of my good dedes, if (I say) they do these thynges to me, that is: condempne me to the shamefull deth of the crosse / without all iustice: what shall they do to the drie tree or stocke / that is to the synner / whiche wanteth the moisture of grace / the fruyte of iu∣stice / the grenisse or florisshynge of the conscience, what payne (thynke you) be they worthy to haue. O Iesu, thou grene tre. O our hed. O thou glorie of all meake persons. O thou cedre of clenlynes, Palme of pacyence, Olyue of mercy, Vyne of glad∣nes, shewe to vs what was done to the? And he answering saith this grene tre is pilled or the barke pulled of, it is shred / lopte / it is cut downe and cast vpon the erth. Marke this well frendes sith he that came in to this worlde without synne: departed not hens without most greuous paynes and passyon: what paynes then be they worthye to haue / whiche were conceyued and borne in synne, and all theyr lyfe haue continued in synne? Herunto saythe saynte Gregorie. As ofte as I remember the deth of our sauiour / the pacyence of Iob / and the death of Iohan the Bap¦tiste. I say to the (O synner) therby I consider what paynes shall they suffer when god reproueth: syth tho whome he loueth and hathe chosen / suffer so greuous paynes. Fourthlye / this ledynge was moche paynfull to Christe, For the place whether he wente: was moche fylthye and stynkynge, It is called in Ebrew: Golgoltha / that is by interp̄tation / Iocus Caluarie, The place of the skull, for Caluaria is called ye skull of a mannes hed when the skynne / flesshe & the heire is all gone, this place was
so called bycause all they that were condempned to deth were hea¦ded or hanged there. To that place they broughte hym: bycause men shulde suppose that he was a misordred person. There was also many boones of deade mennes bodyes / and specyallye the skulles of the heedes spredde abrode ouer all that place / and that made it abhominable to beholde and also stynkyng. And for this cause this leadynge was moche paynfull to Christe, and the space that Christe went bearynge his crosse: was .vi.C.lxvi. passes. And from the fote of the mount of Caluary vnto the top where as the crosse was fixed in the erth: were fyfty passes. And in this ledynge Christ fel. v. tymes vnder the crosse vnto the erth, and when they had brought hym to that place: the saugiours pul¦led of his clothes. &c. as in the next article. ¶Here folowe .iii. Lessons. OF this article we may lerne .iii. lessons. First is, as Christ was led wyllyngly vnto his passion with all pacyence / as a shepe vnto his deth: so shuld we wyllyngly and with pacyence be led vnto the obedience of the preceptes of god and of our pre∣lates in the place of our lorde, by the whiche obedience: our pro¦pre wyll is slayne or subdued, this desyred the prophete saynge: Deduc me in semita mandatorum tuorum. &c.Psal. C. 18. Lede me lorde in the path of thy commaundementes: for that I haue desyred. The seconde lesson is that we shulde folowe Christe goyng to his pas∣sion, wepyng the miserie of our awne frayltie with the women, for as Theophilus sayth: The frayle soule signified by the wo∣man, if it with a contrite herte wepe by penaunce: it foloweth Christe. The thyrde lesson is / that pylgryms that go on pyl∣grymege for penaunce or deuocyon, and religious persones for obediens goynge by the way / if at any tyme they be wery: they shulde remember this ledynge of our sauiour Iesus and his we∣rynes. &c. And a man to cōforme hym self to this article: he shuld remember with howe great shame Christe was ledde vnto hys deth for our greate glorie, and so lette hym wepe with the holye women / at lest in the desyre of his hert / and thē pray as foloweth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu which forme wolde be led vnto Golgoltha to be there crucifyed: lede me in the pathe of thy commaundementes,
that I may folowe the steppes of thy passion with the holye wo∣men / and wepe vpon my selfe the miserie of my frayle cōdicyon. ¶Howe Christe was spoyled of his clothes before the crosse. The .xlv. article. THe .xlv. article is the pullyng of Christes clothes before yt he was crucified, for whē Iesus was come to ye place where as he shulde be crucifyed: the saugiours pulled of his clothes before the crosse.Mar. 15. B And as Marke sayth: Dabant ei bibere vinum mirrhatum: They gaue hym to drynke: bytter wyne for it was mixte with gall / as Mathew sayth,Cap. 27. D and when Iesus had tasted of it: he wolde not drynke, for he wolde not mortifye or hurt his tongue, wherwith he intended to praye for his enemyes and to make his testament. And in this was fulfylled the saynge of the {pro}phet.Psal. 68. Dederunt in escam meam fel. &c. They put gall in to my meate, and they gaue me to drynke asell or vynacre. This poynt of the pullyng of Christes clothes doth conueniently make a specyall article: for it is no lityll payne for a man to be stripte naked before all the people, for so they dyd to Christ, for he was all naked without any cloth / the which thing was neuer done before to the most vyle persons, for comonly at the lest they left theyr shyrtes to hyde theyr nakednes. And in this pullyng of his clothes his woūdes that he had before with theyr beatynges and scourgynges: ware renewed to his great sorowe and payne, for his inner garment dyd cleue fast vnto his backe. And herunto sayth the prophet:Psal. 68. Super dolorem vulnerum meorum addiderunt: They added wounde vpon wounde and so sorowe or payne vpon payne vnto me.Ancel ī dia∣log passion̄. O blessed mother / what sorowe was this to the when thou se hym so cruelly handled, thou wente to hym with spede and tyed thy veyle aboute his bodye. This most louely lorde Iesus wold be naked: that thou synner myght beholde howe pitiously that most pure bodie of his was arayed for the, he was naked for the / whiche dyd create the, and beynge eterne god: was cladde with beautie and strēgth, he was naked to whome we synge and saye with the prophete:Psal. C. 3. Confessionem et decorem induisti: amictus lumine sicut vestimento: Thou arte cladde with praysynges and beautie, thou arte cladde with light as with a garmente. This lorde god is made a spectacle to all the worlde / a wonder to many persones and a mockynge stocke to the people / for at hym they shoke theyr hed. Thou our hed / our
ioy and our honour and glorie good Iesus: arte thus despysed. this article is different from the .xxx. article for there he was na¦ked before Pylate and his ministers, and here it was openly be∣fore all the people. There they toke from hym the white garmēt that herode put vpon hym to mocke hym: here they spoyled hym of his owne clothes, there he was stripte naked to be scourged, here to be crucifyed, there he was clad agayne: here they toke all his clothes frome hym.Li. x. super Luc. ca. C. Of this nakednes saynt Ambrose saythe: Christe naked ascended his crosse, and there he shewed hym selfe vnto vs that we myght knowe / howe we were made by god and nature, he hange vpon the crosse: as Adam was in paradise / for as our first Adam dyd inhabyte paradise naked: so the seconde Adam our sauiour Iesus dyd enter in to paradise naked. And as some say: there was a stone vpon the whiche our sauyour Iesus sat naked vnto such tyme the crosse was prepared and made redy, and there sittyng: he suffred many rebukes both by spyttynges / smytynges / and many blasphemouse wordes speakynge to hym. And whan the crosse was made redy: then most furiouslye they toke Christ. &c. as in the next article. A lesson as in ye. xxx. article. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde be spoyled of thy clothes and syt naked before ye crosse: make me to be spoyled or naked from all worldly thynges that be hynderaunce to my saluacyon that I naked myght folowe thy naked crosse. Amen. ¶Howe Christ was layde or spred vpon the Crosse. The .xlvi. article. THe .xlvi. article is the extensyon of Christe vpon the crosse, for after they had taken his clothes frome hym and the crosse was made redy: they with greate fury toke Christe from his mother Marie / not without her great sorowe / wepynge & sobbyng: they cast hym very harde na∣ked as he was vpon the harde crosse lyeng vpon the erth / and so cruelly they spred hym abrode vpon the crosse / and drewe out his armes and legges as a cloth is stretched & drawen out vpon ten∣ters, in somoche they drewe hym so that all his mēbres and ioyn∣tes were in a maner out of theyr proper places. Of this speaketh the prophet sayng:Psal. C 39. Funes extenderunt in laqueum: These moste cruell tormentours haue extended theyr ropes to make a snare for me.Psal. C. 18. And in an other psalme: Funes peccatorum circumplexi sunt me: The roopes of synners haue compassed me aboute, and
that so sharplye: that all his bones myght be nombred: and ther¦fore the same prophet sayth of these tormentours in the persone of Christe:Psal. 21. Dinumerauerunt omnia ossa mea: They haue nombred all my bones, for they dyd prepare the crosse without aduysemēt or any mesure takynge of the length and brede of Christes body, or els they dyd it of pure malice / that is to make the holes so far distance: to put Christ to the more payne. And when Iesus wyl∣lingly prepared hym selfe to lye downe vpon ye crosse: those most wicked and cruell tormentours toke hym by the armes violently and cast his most holye and tender bodye vpon the harde crosse, in so moche that therby the crowne of thornes was thurste more fast and farther in to his hed and so put hym to extreme payne. O thou christen soule beholde the face of thy sauyoure Christe, but howe can thou lyft vp thyne eyne vnto his face to beholde his tor¦mentes without teares? And howe can thou thynke in thy herte of his most greuous paynes without sorowe and syghyng? And consider what tribulation and sorowe he founde when he saught the. And herby ye may perceyue that this extension doth conue∣niently make a specyall article, for therby Christe suffred a great and greuous payne.Lustra. se qui tam per acta. And therfore the churche doth say and synge in a certen hympne: Flecte ramos arbor alta tensa laxa viscera. &c. O thou high tre of the crosse bowe downe thy branches / lawce the bowels that be stretched vpon the. &c. This extension or stret¦chynge forth of the bodie of Christe doth also shewe and declare vnto vs the great effusyon of the goodnes of Christe towardes vs whiche procedeth from his highe and infinite charitie that he hathe to vs. By this extension of his armes and membres vp∣pon the crosse, he doth shewe yt he loued vs asmoche as he might / gyuynge to vs / to gette our loue all that he was in hym self / and all that he myght do. And that whiche he coulde not expresse by worde (for his charitie in vnspeakeable) he dyd expresse it with this signe and token of his bodye, that is in this extensyon and stretchynge oute of his bodye vpon the crosse. And hereunto saynte Bernarde sayth: Verylye oure sauyour Iesus is a large and a liberall dispenser / stewarde / or prouysoure, whiche hath gyuen to vs his owne flesshe to oure meate / and his blode to oure drynke, his soule: for the pryce of oure redemption, hys woundes: for oure remedye agaynste temptacyons, hys ar∣mes: for oure refuge and comforth, his crosse: for oure shelde, his herte: for a token of loue to vs, his water: to bathe and
wasshe vs, his swette: for a medicine to vs, his nayles: for our sauce, his crowne of thornes: to our ournament, his wordes to our instruccyon, both his lyfe and deth: to our example. These be the .xii.Apoc. 22. A fruytes of the tre of lyfe of whiche saynt Iohan spea∣keth in his apocalipse:Exod. 25. C These also be signifyed by the .xii. brea∣des or looues that were dayly sette vpon the table in the temple of god / called mensa propositionis. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson that we shuld extend and streche forthe all our membres and partes of our body in to the obsequy and seruyce of Christe that is our handes and armes to good werkes, our fete in goynge to good and godlye places, our kneys to knele in prayer, and all our senses: to holy exercyse of theyr actes and operacyons, so that we may say with the prophet:Psal. 34. Omnia ossa mea dicent domine quis similis tui: Al my bones shall say: O lorde who is lyke to the? there is none so lo∣uynge to vs as thou arte, therfore we aught to serue the with all the partes of our bodie.Rom̄. 12. A. And herunto saynt Paule exhorteth vs saynge: Obsecro vos vt exhibeatis corpora vestra hostiam viuētem sanctam. &c. I beseche you that ye so order your bodies that they may be a quicke or lyuynge hoste / holye / pleasaunt to god and a reasonable obsequie / that all thynges be done reasonably. Of this extencyon we may take example in the strynges of a harpe or lute / whiche wyll make no sowne good and pleasaunt: except they be extended and writhed vp. And a man to conforme hym selfe vnto this article: he may extende all his membres and specy¦ally his armes in the maner of a crosse, and that outher standyng or lyenge as his deuocyon moueth hym / and also extende all the powers of his saule to the laude and prayse of god / and pray as foloweth or in lyke maner. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wold be extended vpon the crosse & that so cruelly that all thy bones myght be nombred: make me to extende all my membres and powers both of soule and bodye vnto thy laude and praysynge. Amen. ¶Howe Christ was crucifyed. The .xlvii. article.
THe .xlvii. article is the crucifienge of Christ, for our sauiour Iesus wold not onely be extended vpon the crosse, but also wolde be fastened and nayled to the crosse to commende vnto vs his indissoluble chari∣tie wherby he dyd stablysshe our helth. Therfore after that those cruell tormentours had so stretched Christe vpon the crosse that the veynes and synnouse were greatly and aboue mesure extended and also the ioyntes of the boes out of order:Luc. 23. E. then dyd they crucify hym and nayle hym fast to the crosse / bothe his handes and fete / and that with great / harde and grosse nay∣les whiche were so blunte and grosse: that they bracke both skyn and flesshe / synnouse and vaynes, and also put the ioyntes of the bones out of order. And the cause why he wolde be crucifyed: is this, for asmoche as our firste parent Adam extendynge his han¦des to the tre that was forbodden to hym and with his fete going to taste of the fruyte of the sayde tree dyd consente to the deuyle and so make an obligacyon of his awne dampnacyon: therfore our sauiour Iesus that he myght cancell and distroye the sayd ob¦ligacion and writynge, wold be faste nayled both in handes and fete to the tree of the crosse with the nayles of vnsuperable cha∣ritie, therby cancelynge and destroyeng that decre and writyng that was contrarie to our saluacyon,Colos. 2. C. for our sauiour Iesus toke it from the deuyl and fastened it to the crosse as saynt Paule saith O howe gladlye dyd Christ ascende vpon this crosse, with what loue dyd he suffer al these paynes for vs, with what pacyēce was he obedient vnto the dethe? howe great pleasure had his father omnipotent in that obedience? O what sorowes / wepynges and mornynges ware there harde amonge his frendes and louers, and specyally of his most sorowful mother: when he was so cru∣elly extended / fastened / nayled / and in all his holye body vexed? O moste wonder. O the depenes of pitie. O the greate fyre of loue. O the meruaylous pitie of god towardes vs. O the inesti¦mable charitie of god. Besyde this reason we may assigne .iii. other reasons why christ wolde be crucifyed. First that he han∣gynge vpon the crosse myght shewe hym selfe to be a mediatour and meane bitwixt god and man, and this is taken of the glose, Pri ad Timoth. scdo.Pri. Timo. 2. B. Seconde reason is / that as the deuyle dyd ouercome Adam by the tre: so he shulde be ouercome by the tre of the crosse. The thyrde is that he myghte euidentlye shewe that he suffred deth for to repayre the ruyne and decay of the aun∣gelles in heuen, also to bryng out and deliuered his frendes from
hel that is called Lymbus patrum: to gather together his louers and to reconsyle his enemyes. It is comonly sayd that the crosse was made of .iiii. diuerse treeys, that is / the stocke or fote was of Cedre, the streyght longe tree: was a Palme, the armes or tree ouerwharte: was a Cipresse, and the table aboue the crosse wherin the title was writen and fixed: was of Olyue. The ce∣dre signifyeth the profoūdnes of contemplacyon. The Cipresse: fame of good opinyon. The Palme signifieth ye fruyte of iustice And the Olyue: the plentuousnes of mercy. Therfore the crosse of Christ is worthely called the tree of lyfe,Mat. 27. F for of it we may ga∣ther threfolde lyfe or thre maner of lyues. First the lyfe of nature in token herof,Luc. 23. G. When Christ was Crucified: deade men roose a∣gayne to lyfe of nature. Secondly the lyfe of grace and in signe herof: when Christ dyd pray vpō the crosse there were many con∣uerted to grace and knocked vpon theyr brestes.Luc. 23. F. Thyrdly the lyfe of glorie: in token herof: Christ hyngynge vpon the crosse sayd to the thefe: This day thou shalbe with me in paradise. ¶Here folowe .ii. Lessons. THe first lesson is that we shulde crucify our fleshe with all his vyces and concupiscences / that we myghte be fixed to god with nayles, that is: with the preceptes of Iustice: as Christe was nayled to the crosse. The second is: that we be ware that we neuer make nailes wherwith the handes or fete of Christe shulde be nayled or wounded. They make nayles to crucifye Christe: whiche sawe or cause discorde among louers and neyghbours. They wounde or nayle the han¦des of our lorde whiche wyll not gyue almes of suche gooddes as god hath gyuen to them. They nayle the fete of Christ which wyl rather go to tauernes and vayne sportes than to the churche. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde be nayled with moste hard nay∣les vnto the crosse: and therby wolde fasten the obligation and writynge of our synnes and deth vnto thy crosse: nayle fast I beseche the my fleshe with thy feare / that I surely cleuyng fast to thy commaundementes, may euermore be fastened to the and to thy holy crosse. Amen. ¶How Christes handes and fete were nayled & specially of the first or lefte hande. The .xlviii. article.
THe .xlviii. article is the diggynge / borynge or nay∣lynge of Christes handes and fete, whiche caused a specyall and greuous payne to Christ, and therfore they make a specyall article, and herof speaketh the prophet in the person of Christe:Psal. 21. Foderunt manus meas et pedes meos. They haue digged and bored my handes and my fete. But for asmoche as by suche cruell boryng and naylyng Christe suffred or had .iiii. greuouse woundes, of the which eue¦ry one of them caused a specyal and distincte payne: therfore con¦ueniently this article conteyneth in it selfe .iiii. distincte and dy∣uerse articles / that is for euery hand and fote one distincte article so that this .xlviii. article is of the naylynge of the firste hande. The next. of the naylynge of the seconde hande, the .l. article is of the borynge of the firste fote. And the .li. article is of the boo∣rynge or naylynge of the ryght fote. And note here that we say not the ryght hande and the lefte hand, for comonly in scripture by the ryght hande is noted vertue and goodnes, and by the lefte hand vyce & euyl, & in Christ is no sinistrall thyng or euyll. And as saynt Hierom sayth:Su{per} Mar. cap. 15. The extension of the firste hande vnto the crosse: dyd take and nayle faste deth vnto the crosse. And the extension of the seconde hande: dyd fynde lyfe that was perisshed and lost. And the first hande may be here called that hand which they first nayled, whiche paraduenture myght be that hand that we call in vs the left hande bycause it is more nigh to the hert. Or els for a misterie (the whiche those crucifiers dyd not intende) that is this. For firste the euyll / vyce or synne is to be remoued whiche is signified by the lefte hande, and afterwarde is vertue and goodnes brought in, whiche is noted by the ryghte hande. Therfore the first wounde was in the first or lefte hand. In scrip¦ture comonly by ye handes ar vnderstanded werkes. And so these handes of hym that wrought in the begynnyng or made ye world, dyd nowe performe in the crosse the werke of oure redemption, whiche werke standeth in .ii. thynges, that is in the destruccion of deth and reparacyon of lyfe. But firste he destroyed death, wherby is vnderstanded synne / and all that foloweth therof. And therfore we sayd before that the extension of the first hande / vnto the tree of the crosse: dyd take death / and so faste nayle it vnto the crosse. And morouer he wrote with his owne blode in the same hande / as it were in velym or parchment a writynge of his vic∣torie that he had vpon or ouer deth. And that this writyng shulde euer cōtinue: he graued it very depe in to his hand, yea it persed
through his hande. And of this saynt Bernarde sayth: Christe is exalted vpon the crosse / the handes & fete of the moste benigne Iesus be faste nayled to that crosse, his blode is drawen out / our mediatour and meane standeth before his father / as Moyses dyd before god in the breakynge of the golden calfe / to turne away the wrath of his father from vs:Psal. C. 5. that he shulde not destroye vs. And truely our sauiour Iesus stode in cōfraccyon / in breakyng▪ for thoughe he were brosed and broken in all his bodye, yet he dyd not fall downe in soule and mynde, but stode stedfastly in perse∣uerance of good wyll. O blessed Iesu in what state do I se the? O most swete and amiable Iesu / who hath put the to so bitter / cruell and odiouse deth. O onely sauiour of our olde rotten woū¦des, who hath brought the: not onely to most paynfull: but also to suffer moste shameful woundes. O most dulce and swete vyne tree.Psal. 76. O good Iesu is this the fruyte that thy vyneyarde dothe brynge forthe to the, whiche thou translated out of Egipte in to a moste pleasaunt and fruytefull soyle and grounde,Esac. 5. A. and hathe most paciently taried vnto this day of thy mariage / and loked that it shulde haue brought to the swete grapes, but it broughte forth thornes, for it hath crowned the with thornes / these Iues thy vyneyarde haue cōpassed the about with the thornes of theyr synnes Beholde to what bitternes and sharpnes this vyne is turned, not nowe thy vineyarde: but rather a straunger to the, for it denyed the cryenge and sayenge Non habemus regem nisi ce∣sarem:Ioh. 19. C. We haue no kynge but the emperour. Therfore these cur¦sed and cruell tylmen haue caste the out of the vyneyarde of the cy¦tye of Hierusalem / or els out of theyr compaigney and there haue slayne the,Mat. 21. D not sodenly or out of hande: but with a longe tormēt and payne of the crosse, and haue gyuen to the many greuouse woundes with whippynges / beatynges / scourgynges, and at last: naylynge the handes and fete to the crosse where as thou suf¦fred .xxvi. strokes with the hamer vpon thy handes, and .xxxvi. vp on thy fete in dryuynge in the nayles. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne howe to put and hyde all oure troubles / aduersities / temptacyons / infirmities / our syn∣nes and al our paynes dewe for synne: in this most swete wound of the first hande of our sauiour Iesu wherwith he toke deth & al our miserie / and nayled it fast to the crosse. In that maner dyd
saynt Austen sayng:In manua li. cap. 22. When any fylthy cogitacyons doth inpugne me: I runne to the woundes of Christe: and I am helped, when the flesshe oppresseth me: I ryse thorowe the remēbraunce of the woundes of my lorde god, when the deuyll doth lye in a wayte of me: I flye to the woundes of our lorde and he flyeth from me. If carnall concupiscence do moue my bodye: that fier of carnall pleasure is extincte by the remēbraunce of the passion of my lord god. And this in all myne aduersities and temptacyons, I fynde none so sure remedy: as the woundes of Christ, in these I slepe surely / in these I reste without fere and thoughe saynte Austen speake here indifferently of all the woundes of Christe, yet pro∣perlye we may say that this sure remedye is founde in the wound of this firste or lefte hand of Christe. Also it apperteyneth to this wounde, that we shulde auoyde all euyll werkes for the loue of god crucifyed for vs. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this ar¦ticle may ofte kysse this wounde of Christe and ofte remēber the forsayde woundes of saynt Austen. And pray thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me most wretched wold haue thy left hand digged or boored with a nayle / and fastened to the crosse: graunt to me that I may euer put and hyde al myne aduersities / and temptacyons in the moste swete wound of that left hand and that I may fynde in it a sure and holsome remedye agaynste all maner of tribulacyons. Amen. ¶The boorynge or naylynge of the seconde or ryght hande. The .xlix. article. THe .xlix. article is the naylynge of Christes seconde or ryghte hande,Su{per} Mar. 15. wherwith (as saynte Hierome sayth) he founde lyfe: that was lost and perisshed. And here by lyfe: may be taken and vnderstanded all thynges that perteyne to our helth and saluacyon, as afore by deth were vnderstanded synne and all that folowed of synne. This lyfe our sauiour Iesus hath gyuen to vs with his second hande. And of this gyfte he hathe writen to vs a sure preuilege or dede of gyft writen (I saye) with his precyous blode, not in paper or parch∣ment: but in his ryghte hande / whiche also he hath sealed for a perpetuall remēbraunce with a sharp nayle persynge his hande,
as it were with a seale.Secūda Pe¦tri. 1. A. And herunto sayth saynt Peter: Maxima et preciosa vobis promissa donauit deus. &c. Almightie god hath gyuen to you most good and precyous promysses, and therby ye may be made lyke vnto god / and felowes or partakers of his di¦uine and godlye nature. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne howe to hyde all our good wer¦kes that our lorde worketh in vs, in this wounde of this second hande attributyng them, not to ourselfe as that we shuld be the chefe werkers of them: but gyuyng all to the goodnes and grace of god, praynge and desyrynge his grace that all our neg∣ligences and inperfeccyons may be restored / performed and ful∣fylled by this most swete wounde.In manua li. cap. 21. And thus dyd saynte Austen saynge: What so euer I want in my selfe as of my selfe: I vsurp and take it to me, of the bowelles of my lorde Iesus / for frome thens floweth mercy plentuously, nor there wanteth no hooles or ryuers wherby that mercy myght haue recours to me. And therfore I shall euermore prayse the mercyes of our lorde, for the woundes of Iesu Christe be full of mercye, full of pitie, full of swetenes and charitie, by these hooles and riuers: it is leull for me to taste howe swete and pleasaunt my lorde my god is. And thoughe this is spoken generally of all the woundes of Christe: yet specyallye it apperteyneth to the wounde of this seconde or ryght hand. And a man to conforme hym self to this article shuld oftymes kysse the wounde of the ryght hande of the crucifix / and ofte reuolue in his mynde the forsayde wordes of saynte Austen and praye as foloweth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me a wretche wolde haue thy ryght hande persed thorowe with a nayle and so fastened to the crosse: graunt to me that I may hyde in the most swete wounde of thy ryght hande with thankes, al my good werkes that it shal please thy goodnes to worke in me / and that all my negligeces and imperfeccyons may therby be performed and supplyed. Amen. ¶The naylynge of the first foote or lefte fote of Christ. The .l. article.
THe .l. article is the naylynge of the first or lefte foote of Christe, By feete in scripture ar taken and vnderstan∣ded our affeccyons and desyres, with the whiche oure soule goeth / which for the more parte / be in vs senistrall that is of the left parte euyll or imperfite, but in Christe they all be on the ryght syde good and perfyte, and therfore Christ by the wounde of his first or left fote that dyd cure and heale oure euyll cogitacyons & affeccyons. Scripture speakyng of our olde and corrupt man sayth:Gene. 6. A. Cuncta cogitatio cordis humani prona est ad malum omni tempore: All the cogitacyon and desyre of mannes herte is prone and redy to euyll at all tymes. But nowe of man renewed and healed by Christe: may be veryfyed this sayenge of the wyseman:Prou. 11. C Desiderium iustorum omne bonum: The desyre of iuste men is all good. Of these iust men also speaketh the prophet Ezechiell saynge:Ezech. 1. B. Pedes eorum pedes recti: The feete of them be ryght feete / for the affeccyons and desyres of good men be not cro¦ked / frowarde / or turned to euyll, and that is by the efficacitye and vertue of this wounde of the first or lefte foote of Christe. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson that as ofte as we be impugned with euyll cogitacyons / affeccyons or vayne de¦syres: we shulde forthwith flye vnto the wounde of this foote of Christ, for from thens, as from a most pure and holsom foūteyn there floweth to vs an holsom medicine, wherwith all the fylthe of our cogitacyons / all our corrupte affeccyons and desyres and breuely all our euyl and synne is wasshed and so purified and hea¦led. This perceyued wele saynt Austen in hym self when he sayde in his contemplation those wordes that be writen in the lesson of the .xlviii. article. A man to conforme hym selfe to this article, shulde oftymes kysse the wounde of the lefte foote of Christ with the remembraunce of this lesson, and pray as foloweth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu which for me wolde haue thy moste holye feete persed with a great grosse & hard nayle and so to be fastened vnto the crosse: graunt to me yt when so euer I am impugned or trou¦bled with euyl cogitations / sinistrall affeccyons and desyres: I may runne to the wounde of thy left foote and there to fynde and receyue holsome medicynes for my saluacyon. Amen.
¶The naylynge of the seconde or ryght foote of Christ. The .li. article. THe .li. article is the nailyng of the right foot of Christ. By the wounde of this foote our good desyres which of them selfe be feble and imperfyte:Secūda cor 3. B. be strengthed and made perfit. For as saynt Paule sayth: We be not suf¦ficyent of ourselfe / as of our awne vertue: to thynke any good thynge, but our sufficiencye therin is of god, wherfore thoughe our cogitacyons / wylles / affeccyons & desyres be somtyme good of theyr owne kynde and nature: yet they be of no value or merit in the syght of god: excepte they be dyed or put in the blode of the feet of Christe,Psal. 67. therfore the prophet sayth: Vt intinguatur pes tu us in sauguine: Thy foot or affeccyon must he dyed and put in the blode of Christe or els all is without fruyte of eternall rewarde. And herunto sayth the glose vpon these wordes:Psal. 21. Foderunt manus meas et pedes meos:Glosa Cas¦siodori. They haue delued or digged my handes and my feete, he sayth not: Transfixerunt or vulnerauerunt: They hath nayled or wounded: but foderunt: they haue delued or dig∣ged for the erth that is delued is apte to brynge forth fruyte. So Christ digged in his handes and fete, brought to vs the fruyt of lyfe, and no meruell / for he ranne after vs all the dayes of, his lyfe with great thyrst and moste feruent desyre of our health▪ ¶A Lesson. IN this article we lerne how to offre and to put al our good thoughtes / wylles affeccyons and desyres into the frutfull wound of the ryght foote of Christ and that with great thankes ioynynge our desyres vnto his desyres at all tymes / as it ware by a louynge kysse that therby they myghte be performed / and so myght brynge forth good fruyte. So Mary Magdalene dyd kysse the feet of Iesu: and therby she receyued so plentuouse frute that all her affeccyon and loue were turned in to teares of contri∣cyon / compassion and deuocyon, and if at somtyme we can not haue good desyres: at the lest let vs haue a wyll to haue good de∣syres / as Dauyd sayth:Psal. C. 18 My soule hath coueted to desyre thy iu∣stificacyons at all tymes, and if we so do: then god shall accepte our wyll for a dede. A man to conforme hym selfe to this article: may oftymes kysse the wounde of the righte foote of the crucifix with the remembraunce of this lesson / and then pray thus. ¶A prayer.
O Iesu whiche dyd make a founteyne of thy grace sprynge to vs from the holsom and most swete woūde of thy right foote: graunt to me that I may fasten and ioyne all my good de∣syres to that same thy wounde with a louely kysse / and to make them conformable and agreynge to thy holy desyres. Amen. ¶Howe the crosse with Christe vpon it was raysed vp. The .lii. article. THe .lii. article is the areyryng vp or lyftyng vp of Christ vpon the crosse,Anel ī dia∣log passion̄. for after some doctours Christe was nayled to the crosse: the crosse lyeng vpon the erth, and after that he was nayled therunto: they lyfted hym vp with the crosse / and this lyftyng vp and puttynge of the crosse in to the stamp or fote that was fixed in the erth was one of the most greuous paynes of Christ, and that was bycause all the weyght of his bodye dyd rest vpon hys handes and fete nayled, and ther¦fore when they had areysed vp the crosse and put it downe with violence in to the stampe or foote: it dyd so shake the bodye that it rent the woundes of his handes & feet, in so moche that greate plenty or ryuers of blode dyd flowe or runne out of those woun∣des and founteynes of our sauiour. O blessed Iesu howe swet∣ly and pleasantly was thou conuersant with men, Howe greate gyftes dyd thou gyue to men, and that in most abundance? howe harde and sharpe paynes haste thou suffred for them? thou haste suffred harde wordes / harder strokes and beatynges, and most harde tormentes of the crosse, and that in euery parte of thy bo∣dye. Man was seake in his heade / that is in his intention, that is when he dyd any thynge for an euyll intent, whiche intention is as it were the heade of the soule. Man was also seake in hys handes when he dyd euyll werkes or imperfyte, he was also seke in his fete: when he had vnclene affeccyons and desyres / he was seake in his herte for he had euyl and vayne cocitacyons, he was also seake in his hole bodye: for he lyued a worldly lyfe / after the pleasures of the worlde and of the bodye. And for these causes good Iesu / thou wolde be wounded, first in the heade: that thou myght cure all our euyll and peruerse intencyons, thou wold be woūded in thy hādes: to heale al our sinful & remisse operations In thy fete: to purge all our vnclene & worldly affeccyons, thou wolde be wounded in thy hert to clense all our euyll and vayne
cogitacyons. And also thou wolde be scourged and wounded in all thy hole bodie: to amende all our carnall life and worldly con¦uersacyon. But wherfore good Iesu wolde thou be lefte vp on hight?Se de  C. xxx. C. Herunto saynt Austen answering saith, that was: he by∣cause he wolde also purge the ayre from the power of the deuyls, and from the infeccyon o our synnes. And in lyke maner he clen¦sed the erth: by his blode that ranne from his body vnto the erth. Of this exaltacyon and lyftynge vp Christe sayd before:Ioh. 12. E. Si exal∣tatus fuero a terra: omnia traham ad meipsum: If I be exalted or lyfted vp aboue the erth: I shall drawe to me all thynges / that is all my electe and chosen people, also he drewe to hym of all nacy¦ons or of all kynde of people. who is he that hearyng these thyn¦ges / wyll not haue a sure hope and truste to haue remission and forgiuenes of his synnes, and that specyally when he remēbreth and beholdeth the desposicyon of Christes bodie hyngynge vpon the crosse / he hath his hed enclyned downe redy to kysse the / his armes abrode redy to halfe the / his handes open redy to gyue / his hert open to loue the / his fete nayled faste to abyde and continue with the / his body all spred abrode redy to gyue hym selfe holly and all to gether to the. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may take this lesson that we remembring the paynes and passion of our lorde shulde be exalted from the erthe, that is from erthly affeccyons or worldly conuersation at lest / for that tyme of our remembrance / and thoughe it be not gyuen to all persons to be bodylye eleuate or lyfted vp from the erth / as ware Mary Magdalene / saynte Austen mother called Monica / saynte Birgite / with diuers other: yet let vs enforce our selfe with the grace of god to be eleuate in mynde, that so we maye be drawen frome the erthe / vp to Christe hyngynge vpon the crosse, so that we may be of the noumber of them / of whome he spake / saynge:Ioh. 12. E. And I be exalted frome the erthe: I shall drawe to me all my electe people. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article maye of his deuocyon rayse vp his herte and mynde vnto Christe / as if he sawe hym visibly hangynge vpon the crosse. Also he may somtyme shewe that deuocyon: in the out∣warde gesture and behauiour of his bodye / and pray thus. ¶A prayer.
O Iesu whiche for me wolde be lefted vp on the crosse and so wolde be exalted from the erth: make me I besech the to be eleuate from all erthly affeccyons, and to be conuersant in mynde in heuenlye thynges. Amen. ¶Howe .ii. theues were crucified with Christ. The .liii. article. THe .liii. article is the crucifyenge of .ii. theues with Christe, whiche without was done to his great rebuke and shame,Ome. 84. Su{per} Iohn̄ as saynt Crisostom sayth. And also to make men beleue that Christe was culpable in suche thynges as the Iues dyd accuse hym in, and so worthely to suffer death. O the wicked and cursed iniquitie of the Iues in this dede, for they crucified Christ as a thefe, and with hym as the euangeliste sayth:Luc. 23. E. Crucifixerunt duos latrones: vnum a dextris: et alium a fi∣nistris: They crucified .ii. theues / one of the ryghte hande of Christ and the other of his lefte hande. This vilanye our lorde suffred wyllynge to be crucifyed with theues: to shewe that he suffred passion and deth for synners, and herin / was fulfylled the saynge of the prophet:Esa. 53. D Et cum sceleratis reputaus est: He is ac∣compted with theues or reputed to be as one of the wicked per∣sons, he was rekened or accōpted with wicked men in his deth: that by his resurreccyon he might reuyue and quicken them: as saynt Ambrose sayth▪Su{per} Lucā. cap. C. 2. and so our lorde was crucifyed bytwixt .ii. theues as the capteyne and mayster of them, and the worste or moste mischeuous of them, and also that he seynge or hearynge theyr paynes and heuynes: myghte be more troubled and vexed therby in his passyon. By these .ii. theues may be signifyed those persons that be crucifyed with Christe for to do penance for theyr synnes / in religion, and that by {pro}rofession made vnto the same, but some of them vtterly leaue or forsake theyr religion by aposta¦sie, of whom is well veryfyed the sayng of saynt Paule: Nomen dei per vos blasphematur inter gentes:Rom̄. 2. D. The name and religion of god is blasphemed by such apostatays amonges the worldly peo¦ple, and that neuer so moch as in these dayes / our lorde amende it, and these persons be noted by that thee that hang of the lefte hande of Christe and dyd blaspheme Christ. The other that kepe theyr professyon / and paciently bere theyr crosse of penance / be sig¦nified by the other thee that hang on the right hande of Christe and confessed Christe and desyred hym of his mercy.
¶A Lesson. OF this article we maye lerne howe we shulde be crucified with Christe bitwixt two theues. For as Iesus was cru∣cified and .ii. theues with hym: so morally our spirite noted by Christ: shuld be crucifyed bitwixt .ii. theues yt is the flesshe & the worlde. The flesshe is to be crucifyed: as the thefe on the right syde.Gala. 5. D. And herunto saynt Paule sayth: Qui Christi sunt: carnem suam crucifixerunt cum viciis: They that be verye true christians haue crucified and subdued theyr flesshe and sensualitie with all vyces. The worlde is to be crucified as the thefe on the left hand. And therfore saynt Paule sayth:Gal. 6. D. Nichi mundus crucifixus est: et ego mundo: The worlde is crucifyed to me and I to the worlde. These theues thus crucified in vs: our spirite is crucified with Christe in the myddle,Ibidem. cap. 2. D. so that it maye saye with saynte Paule: Christo confixus sum cruci: viuo autem: iam non ego: viuit vero in me Christus: I am crucifyed with Christe / I lyue not nowe with myne own lyfe: for Christ liueth in me: and in his life I do liue. And here note that the left thefe was crucified: but not saued / for he continued in his infidelitie. So the worlde though he be cru∣cifyed: yet he is not saued: for he remayneth in his miserie and wretchednes. The flesshe is crucified and saued with the spirite, for after the generall resurreccyon: it shalbe glorified with the soule.Luc. 23. F. And therfore Christe sayde to the ryghte thefe: Hodie me∣cum eris in paradiso: This day thou shalbe with me in glorie. And farthermore note here that the crosse wherupon our flesshe is crucifyed: is the rigor of discipline or sharpnes of penaunce, and this crosse hath .iiii. branches or partes, that is: watche / abstinence / harde or sharpe wearynge clothes / and sharpe or re∣bukynge wordes. The crosse vpon the whiche the worlde is cru¦cified: is the pouertie of spirite, and this crosse hath also .iiii. ar¦mes: that is the contempte of worldlye glorie / the contempte of mony / of our countrie / and of our kynsfolke. The crosse of the spirite: is the feruour of deuocyon / and his .iiii. armes / be these hope / feare / loue and sorowe, hope is the parte that is vpwarde, feare is downwarde, loue: of the ryght syde, and sorowe: of the lefte parte, the roote wherof all these do sprynge: is charitye. And herunto sayth the apostle:Ephes. 3. D In caritate radicati vt possitis com¦prehendere, &c. Be ye founded in charitie / that ye maye compre∣hende and clerely se with all sayntes what is the length / the brede the hyghte and the depenes. In these wordes (as saynte Austen
sayth and also the glose ordinarye is playnly expressed the figure of the crosse and the misterie therof.In libro de¦vidēdo deo ad paulā cap. 13. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article: shulde ofte remember howe Christ dyd hyng bitwixt .ii. theues,Glosa ordi¦naria super Eph. 3. and remēbre therwith this lesson & pray thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me a wretche wolde be crucified bitwyxt ii. theues and wolde be reputed as one of them: graunte that my spirite may be crucifyed bitwixt the flessh and the world, that I may reste quietely in the in the middle, the extremes that is the flesshe and the worlde crucified to me. Amen. ¶Howe the saugiours diuided Christes garmentes. The .liiii. article. THe .liiii. article is the diuision of Christes garmen¦tes, for when the saugiours had crucified Christe: they toke his garmentes & deuyded them in to .iiii. partes, to euery saugiour one parte, for there were iiii. hangmen, and besydes those .iiii. partes Christ had an other cote that was hole vnsewed or without any seame, for it was wouen or knytte.Ioh. 19. E. Of this cote the saugiours or hang men sayd Non scindamus eam: sed sottiamur de ea cuius sit: We wyll not cut this cote: but cast lottes who shall haue it, and her∣in was fulfylled the scripture whiche sayth:Psalm. 21. Diuiserunt sibi vesti∣menta mea: et super vestem meam miserunt sortem: The hangmen deuyded to them selfe my garmentes, and they cast lottes vpon my garment. This was a great abiection and vilanie to Christ as Crisostom saith,Su{per} Iohn̄ Ome. 84. for they dyd not so to the theues. This thyng is onely done to vyle / abiecte and condempned persons that haue nothynge but his garmentes.Thōs in ca¦thena super Mar. 15. And Theophylus sayth: they dyd this to the rebuke and shame of Christ, and of a wantones as yf they shulde say scornfully / bicause he called hym selfe a kynge we wyll haue iche one of vs, some of his royall or kynges roobes. O meruelous pacyence and dispensacyon of the mercy of Christ whiche is the very lambe of god, a shepe or a lambe doth bothe fede and cloth them, that clyp hym and sley hym, he feades them with his flesshe and body, and clotheth them with his flees. So our true lambe Iesu Christe dyd cloth those saugiours with his garmentes, and also he feades vs daylye in the sacrament of the
aulter with his precyous bodye flesshe and blode. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may note that charitie (which after saynt Austen is signifyed by the cote without seames) can not be deuyded, and yet that same charitie doth knytte vertues togy∣ther. And also by that same cote is signifyed one holye catholical and vniuersall churche whiche gathereth all faythfull people in to one fayth / which churche & faith: No man ought to deuyde by any scisme or heresye. Of this churche speaketh the spouse in his canticles:Cant. 6. C. Vna est columba mea: vna est perfecta mea: My douue (that is my spousesse symple as the douue) is one / my perfecte spousesse is but one / and so theyr is but one churche / as theyr is but one god / one fayth / and one baptisme. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde haue thy garmentes deuyded a∣monges thy crucifiers / and wolde haue them cast lottes for thy vnsewed cote that was wouen or knyt and without seames: graunt to me to take parte with thy saintes and to folowe theyr examples in the kepynge of thy commaundementes / and that I maye euer keape thy charitie in me. Amen. ¶Of the writynge of the title aboue Christes heade. The .lv. article. THe .lv. article / is the superscription or wrytynge of the title, for Pylate at the desyre of the Iues wrote a title expressynge the cause of Christes deth and this was it:Ioh. 19. D. Iesus nazarenus rex iudeorum: Ie¦sus of Nazareth kynge of the Iues / as if he shuld say / Iesus of Nazareth was crucifyed: bycause he is the kynge of the Iues. And this title was writen thus to separate the cause of his deth / from the causes of the other .ii. that were crucifyed with hym, and that for theyr euyll dedes and lyfe. The Iues in∣tended by this title (as Theophilus sayth) scornfully to rebuke the person of Christ which (as they sayd) made hym selfe a kyng so that the people passynge by and redynge this title / shuld haue no compassion vpon hym:Thōs in ca¦thena super Lu 23. & su{per} Mat. 15. but rather rebuke hym as a tyrante /
that wolde haue vsurped the kyngdome. But Pylate wrote not as they wolde haue had hym to write / that is: that he made hym selfe the kynge of Iues, but he wrote playnly / that Iesus is the kynge of Iues.Su{per} Mat. 27. And herunto saynt Hierome sayth: the Iues of enuy and to scorne Christe / dyd speake for the writyngof the ti∣tle: but the vertue and secreate power of god dyd ordre it other∣wyse in the herte of Pylate, thoughe he were ignorant and wyt not what he dyd (as the glose sayth) For it was god that procu∣red suche a title to be put aboue Christes heed / that therby the Iu¦es myghte knowe that Iesus was theyr kynge / and that they culd not auoyde though they slewe hym for that purpose yt they wolde not knowe hym for theyr kynge,De lita su{per} Iohn̄. 19. that notwithstandynge it appe¦red by the title that he was theyr kynge,Beda. Su{per} Mar. 15. for his kyngdom or dig¦nitie was not lost or hyndred by the deth of the crosse: but rather confirmed / stablysshed and the more strengthed as Bede saythe:Su{per} Lucā. libro. 6. cap. x C. Also by this title Pylate commended Christe in .iii. thynges / thoughe Pylate dyd not so intende, for the deth of Christe was firste the cause of the remission of our synnes, and that is noted in this worde Iesus a sauiour. Secondly the deth of Christ is the cause meritorious of our grace that we haue ad that is no∣ted in this worde Nazarenus, that is as moche to saye as floris∣shynge, for by grace we florisshe in all vertues. Thyrdly by the deth of Christe we be made enheritours of the kyngdome of god noted in these wordes: Rex iudeorum: The kyng of Iues that is of all faithfull people that truely confesse god / and by this kyng we all shalbe kynges in glorie. And when many of the Iues had red this title / and perceyued that it was to theyr infamy & sclaun¦der:Ioh. 19. D. sayd to Pylate, Noli scribere: rx iudeorum: sed quia ipse dixit: rex sum iudeorum: wryte not thus, the kynge of Iues: but that he sayd: I am the kyng of the Iues then Pylate sayd: Quod scripsi scripsi: That I haue writen: I haue writen, as if he shuld say: It is true that I haue writen / and therfore I wyl not chaūge it / I wyll not corrupte the trueth thoughe ye loue falshed. And thoughe Pylate spake thus not knowynge the truth that he sayd, yet that same was prophecied before by the prophet Dauid in the lvii. psalme,Iuxta .lxx. interpretes which speaketh of the passyon of Christ and diuers other before, whiche haue this title or inscription: Ne corrum∣pas tituli inscriptionem: Destroy not or chaunge not the inscrip∣tion of the title. And therfore saynt Gregorie sayth, this tytle was immutable, not for that Pylate wrote it: but for that the truthe sayde: I am the kynge of Iues: that is of the faythfull
people and of suche as confesse & knowlege god to be theyr lorde. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne that whan so euer we be inpug¦ned or troubled by the deuyll: lette vs flye to this title and lay it agaynst hym, that is: Iesus nazarenus rex iudeorum: Ie∣sus of Nazareth kynge of the Iues whiche is called the title of tryumphe or victorie / for it manifestlye expressethe the victorie of Christe that he had agaynst the deuyll. And therfore the deuyl perceyuynge this title fyxed vpon the crosse: moued the Iues to requyre of Pylate that it myghte be chaunged / but Pylate wold not as we sayd before. And amonges all the actes of the passyon of Christe: the deuyll most abhorreth and fereth this victorious title▪ as the deuyll shewed and confessed to a certen deuoute per∣sone by compulsyon in a certen visyon. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me wolde be diffamed scornfully with the superscripcyon of the victorious title: graunt to me that I may strongly lyfe and teyght vnder the banner and victorious title: Iesus nazarenus rex iudeorum: That my ghostlye enemyes afrayde by the syght or hearynge therof: shuld not darre to come nyghe vnto me. Amen. The illusyon and mockynge of Christe crucifyed. The .lvi. article. THe .lvi. article is the mockynge of Christe crucifi∣ed: and here note that Christe was .viii. tymes mocked on good fryday. Firste was in the house of Cayphas. Seconde in the house of Herode. Thyrde in the motehall of Pylate. And the other v. was when Christe was vpon the crosse, the first of them and the .iiii. in order was in the superscription of the title: of yt which we spake in the last article, an other was done of the men that passed by / there as Christ was hyngynge vpon the crosse. The thyrd was done by the princes / scribes and seniours of the Iues. The .iiii. was done by the saugiours, and of these .iii. last: we shall speake in this present article. Of the first of these .iii. which
is the .v.Mat. 27. E in order: the euangelist sayth: Pretereuntes blasphema∣bant eum: The people that passed by that waye dyd blaspheme Christe,Libro. xiii. and this they dyd for .iii. causes, as sayth Symon de Cassia. First for theyr blyndnes and ignorance or want of know¦lege of the truth, and no meruell though they that passed by / dyd blaspheme hym, for they dyd not tarye or abyde to se and knowe the inuisible truthe, so the Iues do passe by / and do not abyde in the knowlege or searchynge of the scripture that therin they myghte fynde and knowe Christe, thoughe Christe sayde to them:Ioh. 5. E. Scrutamini scripturas: Searche your scriptures, for they beare witnes of me. Secondly this was done & spoken to shewe theyr incōstancy or instabilitie in good werkes, for they passyng by: do leaue or do not continue in good werkes before god / as in meditacyon / prayers / werkes of charitie for the pure loue of god, and so they pray not to god that he wolde lyghten theyr vnder∣standyng / that they myght fynde the founten of truth, & thoughe for a lytyll tyme they pray: yet they do not continue / for they be pretereuntes / that is passyng by and not abydynge in any good∣nes. And thyrdly they shewe herby that they receyue not the pro∣phet of his redemption, for they passe by hym whome they haue crucifyed, so that nother they haue compassyon of Christes pay∣nes and passyon, nor yet wyll take parte of the fruyte of our re∣demption which we haue by Christes passyon for they abyde not with hym / but passe by mouyng or shakynge theyr heades vpon hym as if they had the palsey or trimblynge in theyr membres. These .ii. last causes do morally toche those christians that wyll not gyue them to prayer & to good werkes, wherby they mighte obteyne the knowledge and the loue of god, and also those that wyll not remember the passyon of Christe and therfore leese the fruyte therof, for they passe by without fruyte / mouynge theyr heades and saynge:Mat. 27. E Vah qui destruis tēplum dei et in triduo reedi∣ficas illud: salua temetipsum: Vah is an interiection of displeasur or of derisyon and vpbraydynge, as they myght saye: A strawe for the that wyll destroy the temple / and in thre dayes buylde it agayne, these folisshe people vsed or spake the same wordes that those false witnes spake before in Cayphas house.Artic. 13. O sayde they scornynge Christ, if thou coulde do that (that is destroy the tem¦ple and buylde it agayne in .iii. dayes) why doste not thou saue thy selfe / if thou be the sonne of god descende from the crosse and saue thy selfe. And not onely those that passed by dyd thus blas∣pheme Christ: but also the princes of the prestes mockynge hym
with the scribes and seniours dyd say: Alios saluos ecit: seipsum non potest saluum facere:Mat. 27. E And this is the seconde illusion of this article / and the .vi. in order, these princes and seniours sayde / he saued other: but he can not saue hym selfe. And in these wordes (as saynt Bede sayth) they confesse (thoughe they dyd not so in∣tende) that Christe saued other,Su{per} Mar. 15. and so theyr owne sentence con∣dempned them, for if he saued other: he mighte also haue saued hym selfe if it had pleased hym. The seniours sayd farther Si rex israel est: descendat nunc de cruce: et credimus ei: If he be the kyng of Israell let hym descende from the crosse where as he is fast nay¦led / and then we wyll beleue to hym. To these folisshe and blas∣phemous wordes (as holy pope Leo saith) all the elementes and in a maner all creatures make answere and with one sentēce con¦dempne you,Ser de pas∣siōe domini for heuen / erth / the sonne / the mone / the sterres de∣claryng you to be vnworthy theyr ministery and seruyce do shew to all the worlde your malicyous blyndnes that wold not knowe your creatour and kynge, and that they shewed (I say) by a ter∣rible and ferefull erthquayke, and by the eclipse of the sonne con¦trarie to the order of nature, and with many other merueyles as we shall shewe herafter in the thyrde parte.In prīcipio Morouer the scribes sayd: Si filius dei es: descende de cruce: If thou be the son of god descende from the crosse. I say to you / ye shulde haue sayde thus bycause thou arte the sonne of god: therfore thou wylte not des∣cende from the crosse / for thou was incarnate and toke our na∣ture, for that thou woldest be crucified and suffer deth for vs, for no proet it shulde haue ben to vs to be borne: except also we had bene redemed (Ye sayd)Mat. 27. E If he be the kynge of Israell: let hym descende and we wyll beleue to hym. Ye lye: ye thoughte not as ye sayd. And herunto saynt Gregorie sayth. O folysshe blynde companey of preestes and lerned men, was it impossible to hym to descende from a lytyll or lawe tree: whiche descended frome the heyght of heuens / or frome aboue them? May those nayles holde hym fast whome the heuyns coulde not holde? he came not to delyuer hym selfe for he was not vnder any bondage: but of his owne fre wyll: to delyuer vs from bondage. Also by theyr wordes ye may perceyue whose chyldern they be, for they folowe the voyce of theyr father the deuyll / he sayd:Math. 4. A Si filius dei es mitte te deorsum: If thou be the sonne of god: cast thy selfe downe, the Iues do saye: If thou be the sonne of god descende frome the crosse, he rose from his sepulcre or graue which was moch more than to descende frome the crosse, why dyd not they then beleue
in hym, but ye maye perceyue they thoughte not as they sayde. Not onely they dyd mocke Chryste: but also the saugiours dyd mocke Christe / saynge:Luc. 23. F. Si tu es rex iudeorum saluum te ac: If thou be the kynge of the Iues: saue thy selfe. And this is the thyrde rebube of this article / and the .vii. in order. But thys illusyon of the saugiours was of no hatred or malice agaynste Christe: but of an euyll custome that suche persones done vse to rebuke or scorne the persones condempned to deathe / yet we maye suppose / that this illusyon was to please the Iues, for the saugiours seynge that the Iues mocked Chryste: they thoughte also that by theyr mockynge: they shulde please those Iues. And therfore they sayde, saue thy selfe: if thou haue that vertue and power that thou haste spoken of thy selfe / for thou dyd saye / that thou wold buylde the temple agayne in thre dayes / and that thou wolde ryse agayne after thy deathe. If thou haue suche po∣wer: nowe saue thy selfe. And note heare that there ware foure maner of persones that dyd mocke Christe. Firste / they that passed by / as men rydynge or goynge by the waye / whiche dyd blaspheme hym. Seconde ware the preestes and senyours that stode there abydynge hys crucifyenge. The thyrde ware the saugiours that satte there to keape Chryste that he shulde not escape, and that no man shulde put hym of the crosse, vnto the tyme that he ware deade. And the fourthe was of the theues that ware hanged with hym. By these foure ar signyfyed .iiii. maner of Christians / that call theym selfe Christyans: but they folowe not the lyfe and wyll of our sauyoure Chryste, by the persons that passed by: ar noted couetouse men / that folowe and loue the transitorye gooddes of this worlde / and passe by the waye of Iustyce / for they kepe it not, by the preestes and seny∣ours standynge: ar signifyed prowde and hyghe mynded men whiche stande verye prowdlye in theyr owne conceyte by the appetyte and by the desyre of theyr owne excellencye. By the saugyours that dyd sytte / are signifyed dylycate and slouth∣full persones gyuen all to the lust and pleasure of the wretched bodye. And by the theuys hyngynge: arre noted impacy∣ente persones / and suche other as grudge in aduersitye. But Chryste as moste pacyente and of hys owne naturall goodnes and myldenes / wolde not answere one worde to all these blas∣phemyes: but he prayed for theym. And hereunto saynt Gre∣gorye sayth. This is the propertye of good men, that when they
suffer any wronge: they be not moued to wrathe: but rather to prayer. As so was our most mylde sauyour Iesus, which then spake his firste worde, that he spake vpon the crosse, and that was this:Luc. 23. E. Pater ignosce illis: quia nesciunt quid faciunt. Fa∣ther / forgyue them, for they knowe not what they do. In this prayer we be taughte to heare shortelye suche persones as aske a∣ny thynge of vs, also to remitte the iniuries and wronges done to vs, and to desire no vengeance, and also to loue our enemyes and pray for theym. who hathe so harde a harte that wyll not melte and be made softe at this prayer of Christe, as the prophet saythe:Psal. 94. Hodie si vocem eius audieritis nolite obdurare corda ves tra: If ye here this day the voyce of god: suffer not your hertes to be indurate or obstinate. Our lorde sayde: Father forgyue them: for they knowe not what they do, for they do moche good and profytte to me, and greate hurte and euyll to theym selfe. And truelye so it is: For he that doth wronge or euyll vnto an o∣ther man: he knowethe not what synne and payne he getteth to hym selfe, and what grace and glorie he opteyneth to the persone that pacyentlye and gladlye suffrethe wronge. Or els they do not knowe what they do, for they knowe not that I am the sonne of god, they knowe that they crucifye one: but whome they cru¦cifye:Su{per}. Lucā capi. x C. they knowe not. And here saythe saynte Bede, that Christe dyd not praye for theym that knewe hym to be the sonne of god, and of malyce / pryde / and enuye / dyd crucifye hym: but he prayed for theym, whiche hauynge a goodde zele of the lawe of almyghtye god / thowghe it were not wele ordred, dyd not knowe what they dyd. For there ware somme symple and also vnlerned persones, deceyued by the preestes of the Iu¦wes, the whiche persewed Chryste of a zele that they hadde to the same lawe, and for thyese he dydde praye, And that same prayer was not in vayne, For in one daye after the as∣cencyon of oure sauyoure Chryste there ware conuerted of them thre thowsande.Actuū. 2. G et. 4. A. and in an other daye, fyue thowsande. And no dowte that was by the vertue of this prayer of our lorde Ie¦su Christe,Esae. 53. D as the ordinarye glose saythe vpon this texte of E∣saie: Et pro transgressoribus orauit: He dyd praye for his ene∣myes and transgressoures of his lawe. O howe swete a me∣lodye was bytwixte the prayer of our lorde Iesu Christe, and the knockynge or smytynge in of the nayles in to his handes
and fete, thorowe the whiche armony so many thowsandes ware conuerted to Christe? And that was no meruell, for Christe ke∣pynge so greate myldnes and meakenes in his contumelyes and rebukes / hauynge so great pacyence in his tormentes, and also shewynge so great benignitie and charitie to his crucifyers: dyd euidently declare hym selfe to be the sonne of god the father to whome he prayed for his crucifyers, what miracle can be more then this charitable pitye. ¶A Contemplation of this prayer of Christe. Pater ignosce illis: Father forgyue them. THis prayer was a worde of greate pacyence / a signe of great loue and vnspeakeable goodnes / of greate swetenes and forgyuenes. In this prayer do apere thre actes or werkes of charitie. Firste for that he prayed most affectuouslye for his crucifyers. Se∣conde, for to his prayer he added and put to teares / for he wepte. Thyrde he offred his prayers for them: with great sheddynge of teares / and also a myghtye or great voyce or crye. Of this pra∣yer saynt Bernarde sayth:In ser▪ fer̄. 4. ebdo pen̄ Christ scourged with whippes / crow¦ned with thornes / crucifyed and nayled with greate grosse nay∣les / fylled with rebukes / forgettynge all these sorowes / sayde: Father forgyue them. Frome this charitable lorde cometh great mercy to our bodyes and moche more to our soules. O good Ie¦su howe moche is thy mercye stablysshed vpon wicked men. And howe greate is the multitude of the swetenes of thy mercy, for thou shalte make vs that feruently desire the to drinke of the plen¦tuous ryuer of thy swetenes and pleasure. Also the same saynte Bernarde sayth:In serm̄ de passion̄ dn̄i. who and of what kynde is that person which in all his tribulations and tormentes wolde not ones open hys mouthe to compleyne or to excuse hym selfe / to threat or to curse his cruell aduersaryes? and aboue all this: at last he opened hys mouthe and spake for his enemyes a blessed worde / suche a word as hathe not ben harde frome the begynnynge of the worlde, that is: Father forgyue them. O my soule haste thou euer sene any man so myld / so pacyent / so charytable? Consider what quietnes pacyence and charitie was hyd in that most swete brest and hart he wolde not shewe his iniuries / he regarded not his paynes
he wolde not speake of his rebukes: but he had compassyon of theym: of whome he suffred these thynges / he cured theym that wounded hym, he procured life for them that slewe hym / and said Father forgyue them. O my soule hyde or put vp this most swete worde of Christ in the treasor of thy hert, that as ote as thy ene¦myes be cruell agaynst the: thou mayst remembre the abundance of this swetenes of blessed Iesu, and so to lay or put this worde and prayer of Iesu as a shelde for thy defence agaynst the assaul∣tes of thyne enemyes, thy spouse and lorde Iesus doth praye for his crucifyers: shalt not thou pray for thy detractours? let vs yet repete this prayer, father (sayth Iesus) forgyue them. what name is this father? It is a name of naturall loue. Chylderne when they wolde haue any thynge or greatly desyre a thyng / they be wont to name theyr father, to reduce vnto his mynde the natu¦rall loue that fathers haue vnto theyr chylderne, that therby they myght the more shortly haue theyr desyre. So our sauyour Ie∣sus / pitious and mercifull / pacyence and of moche compassion / good and louynge to all persons / though he knewe that he was euer harde in his peticyons to his father: yet to shewe vnto vs with howe great affeccyon and desyre we shulde pray for our ene¦myes: in his prayer he put that name of loue / Father, as if he shulde say: I beseche the for thy fatherly loue: in whiche loue we be one, to here my prayer and to forgyue them that crucifye me. Knowe the loue of thy sonne: that thou mayst forgyue myne ene¦myes.Su{per} Mat. 27. Also saynt Hierome sayth: Al these illusyons and scornes or mockynges ware done to Christe by the mocyon of the deules / whiche an one as Christ was crucifyed they beganne to perceyue and feele the vertue of the crosse / and so thought that they shulde lese theyr greate power, and therfore they laboured instantelye: that Christe shulde descende downe from the crosse. But Iesus knowynge theyr falshed and crafte: wolde continue vpon the crosse vnto his death, that therby he myghte destroye death and subdue the deuyll. O moste gentyll Iesu / howe greate was here thy pacyence. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne / that when we be in depe con∣templation: in good operation or els in religion / we shuld not descende or leaue them / for any rebukynges / mockynges /
or scornynges of any persons, but continue and pacyently beare suche despysynges for the loue of Christe: as Christ for our loue dyd pacyently beare all the forsayd rebukes, and for our example wolde not descende from the crosse: but there continued vnto his deth,Iudic. 9. B and this was figured in the boke of iudges. where as the vyne tre sayd vnto the other trees (that wolde haue had the vyne to come to them and to haue ben theyr kynge: Nunquid possum de serere vinum meum quod letificat deum et homines. &c. It is conue¦nient for me to forsake my wyne that conforteth both god & men, and come to you to be your kynge? Nay I wyll not. In lyke ma¦ner sayd the olyue tree and the figge tree. So our very true vyne tree (that sayth) Ego sum vitis vera:Ioh. 15. A. I am a true vyne tree, wold not leaue the fruyte of his passion that gladdeth both god / angel and man, and come of the crosse to be promoted among{is} ye Iues. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me crucifyed wolde be mocked and despy∣sed with many rebukefull wordes and yet wolde so chari∣tably pray for thy crucifiers: make me that I neuer descend from my religyon or any good werke, for no suggestion of the deuyll or despysynges of man, but that I may continually perseuer in thy loue / and that I may for thy loue forgyue all them that do or saye any euyll to me or agaynste me, and that I maye euermore praye hertely for them. Amen. ¶Howe the thefe of the lefte hande rebuked Christe. The .lvii. article. THe .lvii. article is the rebukynge that the thefe spake to Christe, for one of the theues that were hanged with Christ / that is he on the left syde of Christ, began to re∣buke Christ sayng:Luce. 23. F. Si tu es xp̄s salua temetipsum et nos. If thou be Christe the sonne of god: saue thy selfe and also vs. This was the .viii. mockynge of the whiche we spake in the last article, and this was more rebuke to Christe than the other thre declared in the laste article, bycause so vyle a persone, wretched and condempned to deth and furthwith shulde suffer deth for his owne synnes and myslyuynge, wold thus so shamefully rebuke the auctor of lyfe. And therfore this rebuke is cōueniently made a special article. But the other thefe hering hym speake so loudly:
dyd sharply blame hym saynge:Luc. 23. F. Ne{que} tu times deum qui in eadem dampnatione es. &c. Dost not thou feare god / that arte condemp¦ned to deth as well as he is, and we be worthely and iustlye con∣dempned to deth, for we suffer worthy paines for our sinnes: but he neuer dyd euyll.Ser. C. xx. de tempore. Of this saynge saynt Austen merueylynge sayth: who taught this thefe to say thus: but he the sonne of god that hange by hym / Christe was hanged nyghe to this thefe: but he was more nyghe in his herte,Ibidem. and therfore he turned hym selfe to Iesus and sayd: Memento mei domine dum veneris in reg∣num tuum: Remember me lorde when thou shalte come in to thy kyngdome, and then Iesus spake his seconde worde vpon the crosse sayng: Amen dico tibi: Hodie mecum eris in paradiso: Tru¦lye I saye to the: this daye thou shalte be with me in my glorie. This confortable promisse Christe made vnto the thefe, to re∣ioyse of the triumphe & victorie that Christe shuld haue agaynst the deuyl.Thōs in ca¦then̄ su{per} lu∣ce. cap. 23. And herunto Theophilus saith: As a victorious kyng retournynge from his triumphe: doth brynge with hym the best of suche prey and goodes as he hathe gotten of his enemyes: so Christe ouercommynge the deuyll: dyd spoyle hym of his beste preys, and one of them / that is / this thefe he brought with hym vnto paradise: that is to the vision and fruition of god / whiche fruition the holye fathers beynge in Lymbo patrum / had: what tyme the soule of Christ descended to them after his deth / for then they dyd se the godhed of Christ, which was neuer separate from the soule: after that it was first ioyned therunto. Here thou soule beholde howe liberall / yea howe prodigall Christe was here, for he gaue his kyngdome to a thefe / heuen to one that was han∣ged vpon a crosse, and paradise to one condempned to deth, and that at one shorte or lytyll peticyon. Also the liberalitie of god dyd gyue to hym more then he asked / and so is he comonly wont to do. And herin all synners haue an example to trust in god / and to forsake theyr synnes, seyng that the thefe so breuelye and short¦ly had forgyuenes of his synnes, for surely his grace is more re∣dy then our desyre or prayer. O good lorde thou dyd say vnto the thefe: This day thou shalte be with me in paradise, & that was to put disparacyon frome our hertes, thou forgaue the thefe: to shewe to vs the fruyte of penaunce / the fountayne of mercy / and the celeritie or spede of forgyuenes. Thou the phisitien of oure soules, dyd saue the thefe accusynge hym selfe and accusyng the, callynge for mercy and rebukyng his felowe that blasphemed the wherfore thou penitent synner / consider what Christe rysynge
from deth and reignynge in glorie maye gyue vnto the: whiche gaue so great gyftes beynge mortal and goynge to his death? If he in that extreme captiuitie and thraldome of deth / dyd gyue so large rewardes: what shall he gyue: beynge in moste hygh lyber¦tie of pleasure and glorie? And to shewe that he wolde do in dede that he promised: he cōfirmed it with an oth sayng: Amen. truly. O what vertue and swetenes had this floure or worde of Christ. ¶A contemplation of this seconde worde spoken by Christe vpon the crosse. Amen dico tibi. &c. THis moste confortable worde of our most swete sa∣uyour Iesu spoken vnto the thefe, that is truly this day thou shalte be with me in paradise / was of that vertue / that therby the thefe was forthwith of an enemie: made a frende / a familier or neyghbour: of a straunger, where before he was a thefe: he was nowe made an holye confessour of Christe. who is he that wyll dispeyre of so pitious and a gracyous harte, so swifte a promiser / and so prompte or redy a gyuer. O good lorde we trust in the that know thy name Iesus, for thou dost not forsake them that trust in the and labour for thy grace. wherfore a most benigne Iesu / we com to the syttynge in the trone of thy maiestie / with as good a mynde as we can, humbly besechynge the that we may be brought in to the / and by the / vnto that glorie, to the whiche thou brought in that thefe that confessed the vpon the crosse. But thou synner / differ not thy conuersion and penaunce vnto the houre of death / trustynge then to opteyne heuen as this thefe dyd, for though it be a good and holsome counsell at all tymes to trust in the greate mercy of god: yet that a man shulde onely trust therof and not to be sory for his synnes and labour to amende hym self by penance: it is a great folysshnes and a presumption, for god is not onelye mercifull: but also iust and rightuous. And thoughe this good thefe and some other persons haue had forgyunes of theyr synnes at theyr laste ende: yet I saye to you that the preuilege of a fewe persons: maketh no comen lawe. And surely there be very fewe that be truely penitent at theyr death, when theyr lyfe hath bene continuallye euyll before, for as it were a monstruous and mer∣ueylous thynge to se a wulfe haue a shepes tayle: so it is seldom sene that an euyll lyfe hath a good and holy ende. But of this ho¦ly thefe, we rede that he hadde .iiii. thynges, for the whiche he
opteyned mercy of god. The firste was that he rebuked his fe∣lowe that blasphemed Christ saynge:Luc. 23. F. Neque tu times deum: Nor thou dost feare god. The seconde is that he accused hym selfe sa∣ynge we be worthely punisshed for our synnes. Thyrde / he excu¦sed Christe saynge: This iuste and good man neuer dyd euyll, forth: he asked forgyuenes / saynge: Remember me good lorde when thou shall come into thy kyngdome. Of this thefe also saīt Gregorie saythe:Li. 18. mora¦liū. ca 25. B There was no thynge in this thefe, at his awne libertie: but only his tonge and his hert. And he (by ye in∣spiration of god) offered to god all that he had in his liberty and power to gyue, yt was his hert / wherwith de dyd beleue faithful∣ly in god to his own iustification. and his mouth: wherwith he dyd confesse Christ to be god by the same fayth, and that was to his eternal health. He had fayth: for he beleued that Christ shuld reigne in glorie as god▪ he had hope: for he trusted and desyred or asked to come to the same glorye. He hadde charitye to god for he defended and magnified Christ the sonne of god, he hadde charitie to man: for he rebuked his felowe for his iniquitie and blasphemye. And also he procured grace and lyfe eternal for hym selfe. where shall we fynde one that thus doth profyte at the ende of his lyfe. Beholde here the greate fayth of this thefe / whiche dyd beleue Christe to be god and to reigne eternally: whome he se there dye so shamefully and miserably.Ser. C. xxx de tempore. I ser. Cxx. And herunto saynt Au¦sten sayth: This holy thefe had a great fayth, for nother for feare of the Iues or saugiours there standynge, nor for his awne gre∣uous paynes / nor for the blasphemye of the other thefe / nor for the departynge of the apostles from Christe, or the denyenge of Peter, nor yet for that it seamed to all men that Christe was a frayle and disparate person not able to helpe hym selfe for al these thynges (I say) he wolde not let to confesse the truth and so to declare his fayth, and therfore he had not onely the remissyon of his synnes: but also of al paynes due for his synnes, for as it ap¦pered: he was more sory of the payne and passion of Christ: than of his owne passion, which he knew that he had deserued. wher¦fore I wolde that euery synner wolde do as that good thefe dyd, that is: to knowe hym selfe charitably to correct his neyghbour, to aske forgyuenes of god, and by his faithful prayers to opteine euerlastyng helth. O thou olde Adam returne somtyme to thyne awne harte / and consider howe the newe Adam Christ dyd serch for the, and where he founde the that is vpon the crosse. who was this these but Adam, not nowe a thefe: but an holye martyr
and confessour of Christe / whiche tourned the necessitie of hys deathe into good wyll and vertue, he chaunged his payne in to glorie / his crosse and deth into triumphe and victorie wherfore thou synfull soule: nowe areyse vp thy selfe in to hope and truste of forgyuenes, if so be that thou wylte labour to folowe the step∣pes and example of thy lorde that suffred for the. ¶Here folowe .iii. Lessons. IN this article we may lerne .iii. lessons: Firste is to beare pacyently the rebukes of other persones / thoughe they be vye persons, for so Christ bare the blasphemous thefe. Second is / that we suffer not the iniuries of god at any tyme but sharp∣ly to rebuke them: as the good thefe dyd. Thyrde that we neuer dispeyre of the mercy of god / thoughe our synnes be neuer so gre¦uous / or that we haue lyen in them al our lyfe tyme, by the exam¦ple of this holy thefe,Ser. C. xxx de tempore. whiche for one worde: was made the enhe¦ritoure of paradise, as saynt Austen sayth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu which forme wold be scornfully rebuked of one thefe and of the other wolde be honorablye confessed to be god: make me for the glorie of thy name to suffer pacyently the rebuk{is} of euyll persons when nede requireth, and neuer to suffer thy in∣iuries, and also to possesse the ioyes of paradise with this holye thefe. Amen. ¶Of the passion that Christe had vpon his mothers sorowe and heuynes The .lviii. article. THe .lviii. article is the compassyon of his mothers so∣rowe. For when Iesus beynge vpon the crosse: se hys mother standynge by the crosse in great sorowe: he had great heuynes therof, he se his mother (I saye) a mo∣ther / a virgine singuler aboue all other mothers / a meake mo∣ther louynge her sonne, aboue the loue of all other mothers to theyr sonnes, and no meruell for she was the mother of god / of the onely sonne of god, and therfore she had more sorowe for the passyon of her sonne: than all other mothers can haue for theyr
sonnes, for at his passion / the swerde of sorowe dyd runne tho∣rowe the soule of that most blessed virgyne and mother. O holy virgine what vehemence of compassion and sorowe dyd almygh¦ty god lay vpon the and so oppresse the with heuynes, he made the ioyfull and delyuered the frome all anguysshe and sorowe at the virgynall chyldynge or byrthe of thy moste swete sonne Iesus: but nowe he payed the for both / for nowe he put vpon the all the thrawes and sorowes of a woman trauelynge with chyld. And when thou dyd brynge forth thy sonne / god and man: thou had great ioye, but nowe when the blessed fruyte of thy wombe was in thy sight / crucifyed and slayne: then was thy sorow fare aboue all the paynes and sorowes of a woman chyldynge. In so moche that thou myght wele say that olde Noemy sayde:Ruth. 1. D. Nolite me vocare Noemi: sed Mara, quia amaritudine valde me repleuit omnipotens. Call not me Noemy / that is fayre and pleasant: but call me Mara / that is bittter or sorowfull: for almyghtye god hath fulfylled me with bitternes and sorowe. For this blessed virgyne and mother of god, considerynge and depely weaynge in her herte all the paynes and passion of her sonne Christ / mor∣ned with hym mornyng, sorowed with hym sorowyng, she stode nyghe vnto the crosse, that he myghte be all hole fixed to her in her herte that was fixed for her vpon the crosse. This sorowfull and louynge mother when Christe dyd se: he was moued with great compassion vpon her, she had compassyon of his passyon / and he agayne had more sorowe for compassion of her sorowe. So blessed lady thy sonne shotte at the the same arowe or darte of loue: that thou dyd shote at hym, and therfore he sayth in his canticles:Cant. 4. C. Vulnerasti cor meū soror mea in vno contuitu oculorum tuorum: Thou hast wounded my herte: O my syster / my spouse / my doughter and my mother / thou haste wounded my hert in the sight of thyne eyen. And she in lyke maner myght say the same to her sonne. Christe knewe wele the great sorowes of his mo∣thers hert, he knewe the heuines of her soule, and those sorowes whiche she felte not at his birth: they were nowe doubled to her in his passyon and deth, for her sonne in lyke maner suffred dou∣ble sorowe vpon the crosse / that is: for his awne passion and al∣so for compassion of his mother. And this sorowe for his mother: was not his leste sorowe, and therfore cōueniently it is assigned as a specyall article of the passion of Christe, for the compassion of his mother dyd greatly encrease the paynes of his woundes and passyon, whome he dyd se stande nigh the crosse with a most
sorowfull, with weapynge eyen / great abundance of teares flo∣wynge frome her eyen / with a most heuy countenaunce / with a lamentable voyce and in all the powers and strengthes of her bo¦dye: fayntynge for great sorowe and heuynes. Yet for all these panges: he se her stande constantlye and perseuerantlye / and also strongly lyke a man neuer flyenge from hym. O howe ofte (suppose you) dyd that blyssed vyrgyne sighe and sobbe / saynge in her selfe. O my sonne Iesus: who maye graunte to me that fauour that I myght dye for the / or with the. O my swete sonne Iesu. &c. as ye shal se herafter in the .lxiiii. article. O how ofte (thynke you) dyd she lyfte vp her virginall and shamefaste eyen vnto those cruell woundes of her sonne, if at any tyme she withdrewe them frome the sight of those woundes, or els if she myght beholde them for her continuall weapynge. O howe ofte tymes (beleue you) myghte she haue swoned for the vehemence of her sorowes / for she suffred more cruell sorowes and panges: than the panges of deth, and so she lyuynge: continuallye was in dyenge / and yet coulde not dye, for she was preserued by her sonne that she shulde not dye for his deth. And thus Christ when he se his mother and his disciple whome he loued standynge / that is: Iohan the euangelist, commended or assigned his mother to his disciple Iohan saynge his thyrde that he spake vpon the crosse:Ioh. 19. E. Mulier ecce filius tuus: woman beholde there thy sonne. who may heare Christ speake these wordes without weapynge. He dyd not name her or cal her mother: for that shuld haue moch more greuouslye tormented her, after this Christe sayde to hys disciple Iohan: Ecce mater tua: Beholde there thy mother. And when he spake these fewe wordes: both those .ii. derbeloued / that is: Marie and Iohan wepe full bitterly / those .ii. holy martirs kepte silence / for theyr sorowe was so greate that they could not speake. And from that houre forward: this disciple Iohan toke Marie as his mother: or els he toke her in to his cure and dili∣gence / to prouyde for her in all thynges as for his mother. This thyrde worde or sentence of Christe: Mulier ecce filius tuus: wo∣man beholde thy sonne (this I say) was a worde of great dily∣gence / loue and pitie, for as moche as Christe beyng in so great anguisshe and sorowes of death / wolde yet remembre his moste heuy and sorowfull mother, and prouyde her of a sonne or miny∣ster to attende vpon her to her comforth. And herin he taught vs to haue compassyon of the afflyccyon of our parentes / and to pro¦uyde for them in theyr necessities. O swete lorde Iesu thy crosse
and passion doth torment the greuously / but the compassyon of the mothers sorowe, is no lesse payne to the, and no meruell / O good chylde if thou sorowe / if thou suffer and haue compassyon of the heuynes of thy mother, of her separation from the, of her commendation to a straunger.In medita∣tionib{us} vite xi cap. 79. And here doctours done say / and specyally Bonauenture: that the sorowe that Christe had in the compassyon of his mother / was more intense and more greuous to hym: then the sorowe of hys awne payne and passyon. THe mother of Iesu stode by the crosse / She stode for she neuer fell by synne / she stode to the great glory and prayse of al women, where as his discyples that shulde haue ben men of gostly strengthe & vertue / dyd flye awaye and leaue theyr maister alone. She onely abode with hym constantly in all his greuous panges and paynes / wherin was fulfylled the prophecy of Esaye sayenge in the persone of Chryst complaynynge.Esae. 63. A. Torcular calca∣ui solus et de gentibus non est vir mecum: I onely haue troden in the prease of the crosse / & there was nat one man with me hauyng compassyon vpon me, but my mother alone she had compassyon and stode by me. And nat onely she stode bycause she dyd nat flye / but also for that in so great heuynesse of herte she dyd nothynge vnseamyngly or vnreligyously but ordred her selfe in most god∣lye behauour without any misorder in cryenge or cursynge and suche other lyke / thoughe she suffred in her herte all those pay∣nes that her sonne Iesus suffred in his bodye outwardlye. And (as we sayd before) here she felte and suffred all the panges that she escaped at the byrth of her sonne Iesus. Of these .ii. birthes or chyldynges speaketh the prophet saynge:Esae. 66. C Ante{quam} parturierat: peperit masculum: Before Mary the mother of Iesus hadde any panges or thrawes / she brought forth her sonne, so that she had her sonne without sorowe, then it foloweth in the prophet: Nun quid parturiet terra vna die: aut parietur gens simul? Shall the erth brynge forth with payne all her fruyte in one day, or all the people shalbe brought forth or borne in one day? Note wel these saynges. Firste the prophet spake of the birth of Christe which was without sorowe or payne to his mother and with great ioy. But nowe at her seconde chyldynge where as at the passyon of her sonne Iesus she brought forth all the electe chylderne of god at one birth, she had great panges and manyfolde sorowes. And here note that this blessed mother of mercy dyd helpe or assist the father of mercyes in this moste hyghe werke of mercye, and so with Christe dyd regenerate and redeme al mankynde, and this
generation was to the great sorowe and payne of them both: and herunto Albert sayth though Marye dyd beare her sonne Iesus in greate ioye and without all payne: yet after warde whan she dyd regenerate al the faithful people in faith that was with moch sorowe and of this it appereth that Christ dyd communicate vn∣to his mother this hygh werke of our redemption / for she suffred with hym his passyon in her soule as we sayd before. And note me well here for I do not say that our blessed lady dyd redeme vs bycause Christ of hym selfe was insufficient, for to say so it ware heresye. But I say it pleased our sauyour Christ to haue his mo∣ther present at his passyon / and there to suffer with hym in soule as he suffred in bodye, that so consequently as he is called the fa¦ther of mercy: so she myght be honored and called the mother of mercy, and also for other considerations as foloweth, First that our redemption might reanswere vnto the first condempnation, for in our firste losse and perdicyon both Adam and Eue dyd syn, notwithstandynge, if Adam had not synned we had not ben con∣dempned, and therfore the onely synne of Adam was the cause of our perdicyon, but for asmoche as Eue dyd persuade / moue and counsell Adam to synne, therfore we say that we ware damp¦ned by oure firste mother Eue, so in lyke maner though we be re¦demed by the passyon of Christ, yet for as moche as oure blessed lady was consentynge to that passyon and also sufferyde it in her soule: we may saye that she redemed vs with Christe. Se¦condlye / that as Christe redemyng vs by his passion: was made our father, by the whiche passyon / the sacrament of baptysme / wherin we be regenerate / taketh his efficacitie and vertue, so our blessed ladye myght be called our mother bycause she suffe∣red in her soule the same passion of Christe. Thirdly that after Christ: we al shulde honoure the gloriouse virgyn as our modre. Fourthly for the encrease of her merite. And fiftly that ye passion of Christ shuld be more bitter & paynful to him thorough the pre∣sence of his modre by whom he sheweth his most hyghe charitie vnto vs. She stode also for all other departed from the stablenes of fayth but she onely / and therfore it is sayde of her thus. O good lorde thou haste stablished thy testament vpon the heede of Marie al waye virgin, for after the death of thy son thy fayth onely remayned perfetely in the reason of the same virgyn.
¶Of the sorowe and compassyon of our ladye. AS the great clerke Alberte sayth vpon these wordes of Luke:Luc. 2. E. Tuam ipsius animam pertransibit gladius. The swerde of sorowe shal passe thorowe thyn awne soule. It is the more true exposition and sentence when this pronowne deriuatyue, tuam / is resolued in to his primityue, tui / so that this is the true sentence of the for∣sayd wordes of Luke, the swerde of sorowe / that is: the payne of the passyon and deth of thy sonne (O vyrgyne Mary) which he suffred in his bodye: shall perse and passe thorowe the soule of thyne awne selfe Marie. So that the sorowes whiche thou felt not at the birth of thy sonne, so that therby thou dyd not knowe thy selfe a mother: at his deth thou shalt fele them in moste payn∣full and sorowfull maner, so that thou shalte knowe thy self then to haue had a chylde and to be a mother. Our sauiour Iesus her sonne was to Marie his mother as her awne herte, and therfore when he was borne of her: she felte as if halfe her herte had bene borne and departed from her body. And as that thynge whiche is halfe without and halfe within, if that parte that is outwarde be pricked or hurte: the parte inwarde doth fele the payne aswel as the outwarde parte. And so when Iesus the sonne of the vyr∣gyn was scourged and pricked with thornes, the herce of the glo¦rious virgyn / was in a maner also payned and pricked, and so in lyke maner when her sonne Iesus was crucifyed and his herte persed with a spere: it seamed to her as if her awne herte hadde ben persed with the same spere. And therfore god wroughte no small miracle in that that the gloryous virgyn hys mother woū∣ded inwardlye in her soule with so many greuous and greate sorowes dyd not yelde vp her spiryte and dye, and specyallye when she se her moste dearebeloued sonne hangynge bytwixte two theues / naked / wounded / scorned of all men / crucyfyed / and deade, and then his herte persed with a speare: It was (I saye) a greate miracle that she lyued.Pri. Reg. 4. D. For the wyfe of Phinees the sonne of Hely / the Iudge of Israel hearynge that the arke of god was taken / she beynge greate with chylde: sodaynlye felle to traueyllynge. and for the greate and vehement sorowe the whiche that she hadde for the takynge of the arche of god: she chylded and dyed, and yet her sorowes and greate paynes
ware no thynge so vehement and so greate as the sorowes of the blessed virgyne Mary, nor ware to be compared to the sorowes of the mother of Iesu / whiche dyd se the bodye of her sonne (sig¦nifyed by that arche) crucifyed by hys enemyes / and so put to the moste shamefull death / whiche vyrgyne also the same nyght after that her sonne was buryed: goynge thorowe the cytye of Hierusalem / weapte so bitterlye and pitiouslye / that all bothe men and women that se and herde her: ware prouoked to sorowe and mournynge. Also that moste encreased her sorowes: that she dydde se hym at his deathe, so bette / wounded / in greate thyrste or drynesse / and coulde not helpe hym, and namelye so cruellye racked vpon the crosse / there nayled / and after his deth his herte persed with a speare. These ware her sorowes / and aboue thyese she was compelled to entre in to an other mannes house, and there to continue in sorowe and mournynge. And so the mother of god / the quene of heuen / and the ladye of all the worlde was susteyned with the almes and charitye of other men. But why wolde oure lorde suffer her to haue all these tri∣bulacyons? bycause he intended to exalte her after her deathe a∣boue all creatures in glorye, whiche excellente / singular and vn¦estimable gyfte, he wolde not gyue to her for the merites of any other persone (for the rewarde of glorye / shalbe gyuen after a mannes awne merytes and deseruynges, and not for any other mannes merytes) And therfore he wolde haue hys blessed mo∣ther subdued to harde lobours / paygnes / and sorowes in her selfe, in the moste hyghe pouertye / in extreme vilytye and des∣pection / in the moste profounde mekenesse / moste pure chasty∣tye / moste perfyte charitye / and in other lyke vertues and pay∣nes, and specyally in sufferynge of paynes and sorowes (that she myghte go by the same waye / that her dearebeloued sonne Iesus dyd. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we maye lerne to haue compassion of the af∣flyccyon of our parentes, and to prouyde for them in theyr necessityes accordynglye to the commaundement of god,Exod. xx. B honor thy father and thy mother: and thys oure swete sauyoure Chryst taughte vs by his example.Su{per} Iohn̄ rac. C. xix. And herunto saynte Austen sayth: The tree of the crosse vpon the whiche the mēbres of Christ ware
nayled at his deathe, this tree (I saye) was also a chayre wher∣in our doctoure and mayster Chryste  and taughte vs. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article shulde haue compas∣syon of the mother of Christe, or as I maye saye: of his owne dearbeloued lady and mother / our blessed lady Marie, as Christ hadde compassyon on her, and then praye thus. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche for me crucifyed / hauynge compassyon of thy mothers sorowe and compassyon / wolde diligentlye commende her to thy dearbeloued disciple Iohan, and also com¦mende hym to her, I commende me vnto the and also all myne in that faythe and loue that thou commendeste them togyther: meakelye besechynge the, that for the tendernes of so great loue: thou woldest make me to come truelye and perfytely to thy loue, and thoroughe theyr prayer and commendacyon I maye be pre∣serued and kepte frome all aduersytye and peryll, in the perylles and daungers of this worlde and lyfe. Amen. ¶Howe the manhode of Chryste compleyned hym selfe to be forsaken of god The .lix. article. THe .lix. article is / when Chryste sayde hym selfe to be lefte and also forsaken of god.Mat. 27. E As the euan¦geliste saythe frome the syxte houre of the daye vn∣to the neynth houre, that is / frome .xii. of the clocke vnto thre at after none, there was a greate derke∣nes ouer all the erthe, For the sonne was in an vniuersall eclyp¦se, whiche was agaynste the naturall disposycyon and order of the sonne for that tyme, and therfore it was done by miracle, and by the onelye power of god.Li. 3. de iui¦tate dei. ca. 15. B. And hereunto saynte Austen saythe for as moche as the innocente lambe Chryste / the true sonne of Iustyce dyd suffer the eclypse of deathe, therfore thys visible sonne / the moste clere lyghte of all the worlde, hauynge compassyon of his creatoure and maker: withdrewe the beames of his lyght and hyd hym selfe / as thoughe he durst not or wolde
not beholde his maker hyngynge vpon the crosse, nor se his most vyle and bytter death. And then about the .ix. houre of the day our sauyour Iesus cryed with a greate and lowde voyce. And that was (as Symon de Cassia sayth) for he suffred greate tor∣mentes and paynes.Libro. xiii. Also for that he suffred greate wronge and iniurie. He cryed with a great voyce of the bodye / but that was more by the vertue and power of his godhed: than of his man∣hed. He cryed with a great voyce for the great paynes that he suf¦fred myght not preuayle agaynst hym: but at his awne wyll. He cryed with a great voyce that they myght heare hym and knowe hym hyngynge vpon the crosse, and at the poynt of deth: whom they wolde not heare swetely and deuoutly preachynge: but ra∣ther with a froward & obstinate mynd euer despysed hym. Iesus cryed with a great voyce and spake his .iiii. word vpon the crosse saynge:Mat. 27. F Heli heli lama hazastani: These be wordes of Hebrewe and thus they be spoken in latyn: Deus meus deus meus: vt quid dereliquisti me? My god my god: wherfore haste thou left or for∣saken me? These be not the wordes of the godhed of Christ: for that suffred no payne it is vnpossible, as if the sonne beame shuld shyne vpon a tree, and one person toke an ax or hatchet and dyd kut that tree: the sonne beame shulde in no thynge be hurte ther∣by, and so in lyke maner though the body and manhod of Christ suffred great paynes and deth: yet the godhed therin was in no¦thyng hurte / ne yet suffred any payne, but Christ spake thus for his manhod whiche then seamed to be forsaken of god / for it was subdued to intollerable paynes and most shamefull deth. Christ was lefte in great paynes / that therby and for those paynes we myghte be conforted of god. It was done by a greate miracle that the glorie whiche was in the hygher porcyon of the soule of Chryste / dyd not descende and redounde in to lawer parte of the soule: but was suspended and letted: so that the lawer parte suffred all paynes asmoche as is possible any creature to suffer without death, for it was hollye lefte to it selfe without all com∣forthe, whiche was not in the holye martirs in theyr martirdom and deth, for the comforth that they hadde in the hygher porcyon of theyr soule: dyd redownde vnto theyr senses, so that theyr mar¦tyrdome and paynes was no greate payne to theym, but with greate ioye they suffred them, as it appereth in the lyues of saynt Laurence / Vincente and many other. But oure sauyoure Iesus hadde none suche consolation in his senses: no helpe of
any persone, but all lefte to suffer what so euer was put to hym, and that to the extremitie. And therfore he compleynethe hym selfe to be forsaken of god / whiche myghte not in dede be lefte of god / for the godhed was euer ioyned bothe to the soule and also to the bodye: but this he spake for vs / for he knewe that many of his electe membres shulde come to so greate tribulation: that it shuld seame to them that they were vtterly forsaken of god. Now blessed be our dearbeloued and moste mercyfull sauioure Iesus, whiche fyrst in his awne bodye for vs / and nowe also in vs and with vs it pleaseth hym to suffer our tribulation: for the tribula¦tion that we suffer for iustyce and for god, he reputeth it as hys awne tribulation for he saith:Psal. xC. Cum ipso sum in tribulatione: I am with the good person in his trouble, and that is / that we shulde more surelye and faythfully truste in hym. This payne when he sayd hym selfe to be forsaken of god: was moste greuous payne to hym aboue al the other, for without this leauyng: there shuld haue ben no payne, for who so is consorted by god: there is no torment that can be paynfull to hym. Christe sayde twyes: My god, and that was to shewe the vehemence of his sorowe both in soule and in bodye. And herunto saynt Bonauenture sayth. He cryed with a great voyce for he felte great sorowe / and specyally for the great vnkyndnes of man, for though he suffred for al man kynde: yet there were very few present there that toke fruyte ther¦of at that tyme, as the thefe that hange on the ryghte hande / and the glorious virgyne that was full heuye there by the crosse, so that our lorde myght wele say: why haue I so vaynly and with out fruyte subdued my selfe to so many great paynes and to deth? O blessed lady what sorowe had thou when thou harde thy sonne crye so? He cryed also with a great voyce / for the synne was great whiche was the cause of all that miserie, those paynes and deth. For as saynt Ambrose saith: He wepte and sorowed for the synne and miserie of them: whose nature he had taken. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne howe to haue a recourse to our lorde in all our tribulations, and by our prayer compleyne and shewe to hym our desolation / that it wolde please hym to be∣holde our troubles and helpe vs, for so our sauyour Christ in his troubles and sorowes / cryed vnto god his father / saynge: My god my god why hast thou forsaken me,Su{per} psal. 21. whiche as the glose ordi¦narie
sayth) was not onely a compleynte: but also a prayer, as it appereth in the psalme of the whiche these wordes be taken / for there it is sayd thus:Psa. 21 iu lxx. inpre. Deus deus meus respice in me quare. &c. O god my god beholde me / why hast thou forsaken me. Also saynte Paule speakynge of the prayer of Christe:Hebr. 5. B. seameth to speake of this prayer saynge: Qui in diebus carnis sue preces cum clamore valido et lacrimis offerens: exauditus est pro sua reuerentia: Oure sauiour Iesus in the dayes and tyme of his mortalitie offerynge prayers to his father with a greate crye and with teares: was harde for his reuerence. ¶A prayer. O Lorde Iesu Christe the sonne of the lyuyng god whiche at the .ix. houre of the day for me most wretched hyngynge v∣pon the crosse / cryed to thy father with a great voyce sayng: He li heli lamahazastani: That is: My god my god why haste thou forsaken me: graunt to me that in all my trouble and anguysshe I may cry to the my lorde god with the greate voyce of my herte that so thou neuer suffer me to be reproued / as lefte and forsaken of thy mercy. Amen. ¶Howe they gaue hym to drynke: vinegre or asell. The .lx. article. THe .lx. article is the drynkynge of vineger, for Iesus af¦ter all the forsayd paynes and labours beynge thurstye or drye (for then all that was written of Chryste in the lawe of Moyses or in the prophetes / ware fulfylled, excepte one / that was writen in the psalme:Psal. 68. In siti mea potauerūt me aceto: In my thyrste they gaue to me vineger to drynke) ther¦fore Iesus to fulfyll all the scripture: he sayde: I am drye. Not so to be vnderstande, that Iesus therfore was thirsty / and ther∣fore they gaue to hym vineger to drynke: bycause it was so wry¦ten before by the prophet: but bycause god knewe longe before / that Chryste shulde be drye, and also that the Iues or the saugi∣ours shulde gyue hym vineger to drynke, therfore our lord wold haue it writen by the prophet, and so in this thirst of Christ that scripture was fulfylled,Iohan. 19. and so in lyke maner vnderstande all the other propheties of Christ. Christe sayd: Sitio: I thyrste. And this was his .v. worde that he spake on the crosse, for after
his longe and continuall labour and payne had all the nyght be∣fore and also that same day vnto .iii. of the clocke at after none, also for his effusyon and sheddynge of so moche blode, and for hangynge so longe vpon the crosse in the heate of the day, it was no meruell thoughe he ware drye, and of this the prophet also sayth in the person of Christe:Psal. 21. Aruit tan{quam} testa virtus mea: et lin∣gua mea adhesit faucibus meis: My vertue or strength of my bo∣dy was as dry as a shell / and my tonge clyued fast to my chekes for drynes, and therfore he myght wele saye: Sitio. I thrist. For they that be let blode: be more drye then other men, but our sauy¦oure Iesus was let blode that daye, both in scourgyng / beatyng crownyng with thornes and crucifyeng, besydes his sweatyng, therfore it was no meruell if he were drye. Saynte Bernarde entreatyng this article sayth: O good Iesu why dost thou crye and say: Sitio. I am thristy. Dost not thou knowe that thyne ad¦uersaryes wyl ministre and gyue vnto the: vinegre for thy drynk where as thou gaue them drynke in the deserte when they were thristie?Num̄. xx. B And he answereth in the person of Christe saynge: I thriste and feruently desire the conuersyon of synners, the teares of penaunce / of compunction / of compassion / and of inwarde deuotion. I thyrst your helth and the redemption of all soules. Therfore that Christe dyd here expresse his greate drynes / was not without great misterie. For he dyd not say: I thyrst, for that he desyred any wyne or yet vinegre / whiche he knewe that they shulde gyue to hym. But what drynke (suppose you) dyd he de∣syre, whiche is the founten of the lyuely and holsome water, the veyne of lyfe / the ryuer of all pleasure / the floode wateryng the heuenly paradise. Surely he thristed and desyred our helth / that is: by his thyrst he desyred our thirst, that is / that we shulde de∣syre and thyrst god the well of lyfe. Also I thyrst (sayth Christ by saynt Bernarde) all you that goeth by this way / that ye wold attende and se / if there be any sorowe lyke vnto my sorowe / that by compassyon ye myght kut your hertes / for this day my herte was opened for you. O good Iesu, thou complaynest of thy thyrste: but thou speakes not of thy crosse: thou suffrest pacyent∣ly the crowne of thornes, thou forgettest all thy moste greuous woundes and despysynges, the Iues and the gentylles / they thirsted thy blode and therfore they crucifyed the / but thou thyr∣sted theyr helth / and therfore thou wold dye for them, as if Christ shuld say the helth of your soules doth more tormente me: then all the paynes of my bodye. But whan Christe sayd: Sitio. I
thrist, anone they gaue to hym no good nor holsome drynke: but vinegre, for as the euangelist sayth:Ioh. 9. F. Erat ibi vas aceto plenū. &c. There was a vessel ful of vinegre, and they fylled a sponge with the vinegre / and wonde it aboute with ysope / and fastened it to a rede and so put it to his mouth. This they dyd first / for ther by was the scripture fulfylled that sayd:Psalm. 68. In my thirst they gaue me vinegre to drynke. Secondly to signifye the malice of the Iues whiche went out of kynde from theyr olde holy fathers / for as saynt Austen sayth:Su{per} Iohn̄ trac. C. xix. C. The Iues ware as vinegre declynynge frome the good wyne of the patriarkes and prophetes, in to vy∣negre / that is in to malice and crueltye, hauynge craftye / deceyt∣full and malicyous hertes. These Iues ware conueniently sig∣nifyed by that vessell full of vinegre / for they were full of iniqui∣tye / hauynge theyr hertes lyke to a sponge full of poores or hoo∣les, so theyr hertes ware full of many false deceytes and maly∣cyousenes. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we may lerne to beware that we do not offer vnto Christe to drynke bytter wyne or mixte with gall. For as then the Iues and saugiours dyd to Christe: so do nowe a dayes euyl christians gyue to Christ a bitter drynke: for where as Christe thirsteth and desyreth the helth of theyr soules, they offer to hym the bytternes of theyr synfull lyfe. Tho christians that beleue wele and werke or lyue euyll: they gyue to Chryste wyne mixte with gall, for they mixte the wyne of true fayth with the mirre or gall of euyll conuersacyon, in as moche as by theyr euyll lyfe: they sclaunder the church and specyally nowe a dayes euyll prelates, our lorde amend them. This mixtyng of drynke may be also taken in a good sense. As ye shall se in the prayer fo∣lowynge. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche thirstynge our helth wolde haue vinegre and wyne mixte with mirre and gall offred and gyuen to the to drynke: make me worthelye to offer to the the wyne of deuotion mixte with the mirre of mortifycacyon of my sensualytie / and with the gall of contricyon for my synnes, & that I neuer drynke of the vinegre of infidelitie or of sclaunder / thoughe I taste of
any sclaunder, that is: suffer wrongfully any sclaunder. Amen. ¶The consummacyon and end of the passyon of Christe. The .lxi. article. THe .lxi. article is the end and consummacyon of the hole passyon. for when Iesus had taken or tasted of the vy∣negre.Ioh. 10. F. He spake the .vi. worde vpon the crosse saynge: Consummatum est: It is done or ended, as it in the tast∣ynge of that vinegre the fulnes of his passyon and paynes was consummate and ended, or els that tastynge done: all that was prophecyed of Christe that he shulde suffer: was ended, onelye deth excepte. And therfore as our heed and capteyne Christ suf∣ferynge the bytternes of his passion for oure synnes perseuered and continued pacyentlye vnto the ende / that is vnto that al that was spoken by the prophetes and scripture that he shulde suffer ware fulfylled, so we (if we wyll be the membres of this heade) shulde continue in perseuerant pacyence in all oure aduersytyes and troubles / so that we myght come to the ende of all our trou∣bles, our most benigne sauiour Iesu beyng our guyde, and that we myght say with Christe:Scd a Tim̄. 4. B. Consummatum est: That is: With thy helpe Iesu and not by my vertue, I haue faught a good ba∣tell or feyght. I haue ended my course and kept my fayth. Then a thynge is sayd to be consummate: when all together is perfyt∣ly ended and gathered to gyther as it ware in a somme. So our sauyour Christ after that he had suffred all the paynes that be spo¦ken of before, in the. lx articles, so that there was no more to be suffred but death, then he gathered all them togyther as it ware in one heape or somme, and so offred them al to his father sayng: Consummatum est: That is to say: What so euer scripture sayde that I shulde suffer: I haue done it / perfourmed and ended it. The werke of my passyon is ended whiche I offer to my father for the redemption of man kynde. Nor this consummacyon was without naturall payne, as if a man hadde passed many greate perylles / daungers / and paynes / he can not lyghtly remembre and recompte them without a grudgynge to the bodye / thoughe on the other parte he be glad that he hath so escaped them. Suche a paynfull horror and grudgynge had Christ at this remēbrance and no meruell / for he was as yet hangynge vpon the crosse / to his no small payne, and also this remembraunce and consum∣macyon conteyned in it selfe virtually al the forsaid articles of the
passyon of Christ / whiche all in summe he noted when he sayde: Consummatum est: It is ended. And therfore this consummacy∣on doth conueniently make a specyall article. ¶Of this .vi. worde: Consummatum est. THe .vi. worde that Christ spake vpon the crosse, that is Consummatum est: It is ended, was a worde of greate perfeccyon / notynge therby (as we sayd be∣fore) that he had done and suffred all thyng{is} which he ought to do or suffer for the redemption of man. And that is declared by this example, a good phisicyen wyl thus order his pacyent, whose helth he intendeth. First he wyll gyue or assigne to hym his dieat. Seconly he wyl cast hym in a sweat. Thyrdly if these be not sufficyent: he wyll let hym blode, to cor¦recte the euyll humors. And fourthly he wyl gyue hym a pocyon to auoyde all the euyll mater that is the cause of his sekenes So our lorde Christe that he myght cure vs from the infirmitie and seakenes of synne: he fyrste kepte a dyeat / for he fasted .xl. dayes Secondly he swet blode for vs. Thyrdly he was let blode in all the partes of his bodye / when as he shedde his blode without weyght or mesure / so that his bodye hangynge vpon the crosse: was as drye as a fyrebrand. Fourthly and last, not content with all the other medicynes: he toke a most bitter pocyon, when for to cure oure synfull sekenes, he toke vinegre and tasted therof, and therfore he sayd conueniently: Consummatum est: All thyn∣ges be fulfylled that I shulde suffer for the helthe of man. And thus after that he had suffred in all the membres of his bodye the sharpe dartes of moste bytter paynes and passyon, he myghte well say the wordes of the prophet:Tren̄. 3. B. Repleuit me amaritudine: in∣ebriauit me absinthio. He hath fulfylled me with bitternes, he hath made me dronke with wormewod, and so in his passyon he dranke a bytter pocyon / and that to cure vs. ¶A Lesson. OF this article we maye take this lesson / that in the ende of euery good werke that we do, whiche hath diuerse actes and partes: we shulde gather them togyther as it ware in a sōme and so offer that good werke to god, and so comonlye we vse in all the seruyce of the churche for euer in the ende: we conclude
with a collecte, whiche is so called for asmoche as in that prayer all the office or seruice said before, is as it ware virtually gadred and conteyned in that orison or collect as in a summe. And so this worde. Consummatum est, is as it were the collecte of the hole pas∣sion of Christ vnto his death. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article: shuld remembre breuely as it were in a summe all the forsayde artycles of Chrystes passion, and so gyue thankes to all myghtie god for them, and pray as foloweth. ¶A prayer. O Iesu whiche, offeryng the consummacion of thy hole pas∣sion as it ware in a ume / o god thy father for we, dyd say, Consummatum est. it is ended▪ grant to me that I may dewly con∣summate and ende all the good werkes and paynes that it shall please thy grace to werke in me and by me, and so ended: to offre them with due thankes vnto god the father, by the. Amen. ¶Of the yeldyng vp of his soule or of the death of Christe The. lxii article. THe .lxii. article is the death of Christe, for when Christe had sayde It is ended: then he criynge agayne with a greate voyce sayd (or no necessite, but for our example) tuas cōmendo spiritum meum. Father, I commend my spirite in to thy handes.Luce. 23. F This was the .vii. and last worde that he spake vpon the crosse. And by this sayng, he wolde declare vnto vs that the soules of holy sayntes: be in ye handes of god after theyr departyng from the bodye, wher as before yt tyme all the soules ware in the hande & power of hell. And by this his commendacion he commendeth to his father all his electe people for we be his membres as saynt Paule sayth. Omnes vnum sumus in Christo iesu.Gala. 3. D. We be all one in Christe iesu. Which in the dayes of his mortalitie offerynge prayers to his father with a greate crye and teares:Hebr. 5. B. was hard for his reuerence. And this worde sayd and prayer made: he bowed downe his heade, and so gaue vp his spi∣rite.Hiero su{per} Mar. 15. In criyng, weapyng, and praing / As the glose sayth, we that be erthly or made of ye erth: do dye or giue vp our spirite / with out any voyce / or at most / a softe or small voyce. But Christ yt camme from heuen: he at his death exalted his voyce, and cried with a great and lowde voyce / He that is not moued with this voyce: is
more heuy than the erth, more harde than ye stone, and more close and stynkyng than dead menes graues / for all these ware broken, moued and open by this voyce. And note here that amonge al the paynes that Chryst suffered: this payne of death was most sharpe and paynefull for as the Philosopher sayth.3. Ethi. Ca. vi. Death is the moste terrible of all terrible or fearefull thynges / and that is for the na∣turall inclinacion that the soule hathe to the bodye. But there is a more speciall cause in Christe for as Damasten sayth.Lib. 3. Ca. xxvii. His god∣hed was vnit and knyt, bothe to the soule / and also to the bodye, and therfore, that separatiō of his soule from his body: was most paynfull to hym. Chryste enclined and bowed downe his heade: to shewe vnto vs. iiii. thynges, that is. Fyrste the greuouse and heuy burden that was laid vpon him. A man that is ouercharged or oppressyd with a heuy burden: is wonte to stowpe and bowe downe his heade. But Christe was oppressid with the heuy bur∣den of our synnes as sait Petre sayth.Pri. Petri. sedo. D. Peccata nostra ipse pertulit in corpore suo super lignum. Christe bare our synnes in his bodye vpon a tree, that is the crosse. Also Christe sayth by the prophet. Conuolute sunt iniquitates et imposite collo meo.Tren̄. prīo: E. The iniquites or synnes be folden or lappid vp to gether, and laid vpon my necke, and therfore no meruel though he bowid downe his heade to shew vnto vs what heuy burden he bare. Secondely he enclined his heade to shewe his pouertie, for Iesus the son of god at his death was so pore that he had no place where to reste his head, and ther∣fore he bowyd it downe. Thyrdly to shewe to vs that meaknes is the way to glorie euerlastyng. Herunto Hugo sayth. We shall re∣turne vnto the heuenly cuntre: by the waye of meakenes. And the wiseman sayth.Pro. 4. B. Viam sapientie monstrabo tibi. &c. I shall shewe to the the way of wisdom, and I shall lead the by the pathes of equi∣tie: which when thou arte ones entred in to: thy feet shall not let∣ted nor thou runnyng shal haue any let or obstacle. This waye is the vertu of meakenes,Luc. 18. C. for as Christ sayth. Qui sehumiliat: exalta∣bitur. He yt meaketh hym selfe shalbe exalted, & as ye {pro}phet sayth. Non habitabit in medio domus mee qui facit su{per}biam.Psal. C. The prowde person shall not dwell in my house. Forthly Chryste enclyned his heade to gyue thankes to his father for the victorie he had, for by his death: he distroyed death. And hereunto saynt Paule sayth. Absorpta est mors in victoria.1. Cor. xv. G. Death is destroyed by the victorie and triumphe of Chryst.Ibidem. And in the same place. Deo gracias qui fe cit nos vincere in domino nostro iesu Christo.Beda. li. vi: Su{per}. Lucā capi. x C. Thankes be to god that hath gyuen to vs the victorie ouer death by our lorde Iesu
Christe. And note here after summe doctours, that the same houre that our fyrste adam dyd synne / our seconde adam Chryste gaue vp his spirite, and so the same houre that the fyrste adam by his synne subdewed hym selfe and al his posteritie to death, the same houre this second adam by his death distroyed death eternall so that none of his electe chylderne shalbe subdued there vnto. And the same houre that paradise was shyt frome our fyrste adam: the same houre Christe openyd paradyse to vs. ¶A compassion and a contemplacion of the death of Christe. SAynt Bernard entreatynge this artycle sayth on this ma∣ner. I am sory and haue cōpassion vpon ye my lorde, kyng / mayster and father yea my good brother and most belouyd Iesu, more amyable and to belouyd aboue all women whose arowe or dart hath not turne backward / thyne arowes ben very sharpe / thy doctrine is valiant and myghtie,Scdo. regū primo. D. thy sermon and worde is quicke and leuely of moche efficacitie and vertue,Psal. C. xix more persynge than any two edged swerd / entryng thorough,Heb. 4. C. euen to the deui∣dyng a sonder the soule & the spirite. Also thy shyld neuer declined from the batell, for thou haste crowned vs with the shylde of thy grace and of thy good wyll. The spear of thy prayers neuer tur∣ned bac void, for yu prayed for thy enemies yt they shuld not perish. How more then dost thou praye for thy fryndes and saruauntes. Thou art stronger than the lion,Apoc. 5. B. yea thou art ye lion of the tribue or stocke of Iuda,Prīa. Pe. 5. C. that haste ouercumme the raumpyng lion that runnyth all ouer, searchyng whom he myght deuoure. Thou art more swyfte than the egle.Psal. xviii. For thou as a giant had great ioy to runne in the waye / to fulfyll the misterie of thy incarnation, vnto the tyme yt thou as an egle dyd prouoke thy byrdes to flye. Thou spred the wynges of thyne armes abrode vpon ye crosse, and fliyng ouer vs: thou toke vs / lefted vs vp, and bare vs vpon thy sholders with greate strenght: vnto thy holie habitacle / vnto the houshold of thy father,Luce. 15. B where, for the fedyng of thy shepe and drāme, that was loste, and by thy passion founde agayne? thou madest a great feast and ioyfull to thy fryndes and neyghboures, thy holy aun∣gels, makyng to them greate ioy for the conuersion of a penitent synner. And though thou be suche a myghtie and noble {per}son yet thou wast condempned vnto the most shamefull death, and so thy spirite commendyd in to the handes of thy father, and thy heade
enclined and bowed downe: thou gaue vp thy spirite. O all ye that desyre to ioy in our lorde cumme I beseach you and sorowe with me. Take hede and behold our myghtye and strong Dauid, how he is all to rent with wheppys behold hym, whom we most desire, and whom the aungelles desire to behold, how he is slayn in our batell. Wher is thy red rosy colour? where is thy beautie? where shall thou fynde fayrnes in thy broused bodye? Behold, our dayes haue decayed and fayled, the dayes (I say) of our most be∣nigne Iesu which onely is the day without all derknes. And his bones haue waxed drye as a fier brande,Psal. C. i. he is cut downe as the grasse: and his hart hath wydred away, he was lyfted vpon the crosse and very greuously hurt and broused. And though he was thus shamefully and vilenously arayed outwardly: yet he kepte his beautie and fayrnes in wardly. Therfore faynt not for hym in thy trobles, for the Iues and gentylles that see this person han∣gyng vpon the crosse (which in hym selfe was more beautyouse than all the chylderne of men) they (I say) onely beholdyng out∣ward thynges:Psal. xliiii. see hym / hauyng nother beautie ne yet fairnes, for his face was more lyke to a lepre than a clene man, and all the dis∣posicion of his bodie was then very deforme and foule to beholde, yet of that deformytie of our redemar: dyd essew and flew out / the price of our beautie / of our inwarde beautie I mean / In parte we haue shewed vnto you now the deformitie & blaknes or fowl∣nes of the bodie of moste amyable Iesu, but his inward beautie there is no man that can declare / for in him restith and inhabiteth the hole diuinitie or godhed / let vs therfore be contented to be de∣formed in our bodie outwardly with our sauiour Iesu shameful∣ly deformed / let vs conforme our selfe in our bodye to the body of our true vine Christ: that he myght reforme the body of our mor∣talitie vnto the bodie of his clernes and glorification. O death most to be belouyd. O passion of Christ, most to be de∣sired. O meruelouse misteries, what is more meruelouse thā that death shuld gyue lyfe? wondes: shuld cure and heale, blode shuld purifie, and that sorowe: shuld enflame and kyndle loue? The openyng of his syde: doth cople & ioyne hert vnto hert. Also what is more meruelouse than that the sonne in the eclipse or darked by clowdes shuld shyne more clere and bryght? the fier extincte, doth more enflame and kyndle the hert / the shameful passion doth glo∣rifie and make gloriouse, thirst or drines: maketh one dronke. Nakydnes: doth cloth with the garmentes of vertue / the handes fast nayled: doth louce vs / his feet nayled: done make vs to rūne,
Christ yeldyng his spirit: doth gyue to vs lyfe / he diyng vpon the tree: doth call vs to heuen / the sonne of god is lead to death, he is smiten / buffetid and beat: that is our victorie, he is crowned with thornys: that cam to breake the thornys of our synnes / he was bownd: that lowseth them that be bounde, he was hanged vpon a tree: that reyseth them that be fallen downe / the well of lyfe: hath vinegre offeryd to hym for his drynke / health is wounded / lyfe: dieth, pitie is scourged for the synner / wisdom is mocked lyke a fole / treuth is slayne as a lier / Iustice is dapned for a wicked per∣son / mercy is vexed for an infidell, swetnes is made dronke with gall, life is deade for the deed man. All this is the sayng of faynt Austen.Sermone. C. xiiii. de t{per}e. By the premisses ye may perceyue that Christe suffred death / he iuste and ryghtuouse: for vs vnryghtuouse, he suffred death, for vniuste persons, by vniuste persones, with vniuste per∣sons, for vniuste causes / and vnder vniuste iudges / and also with vniuste paynes and tormentes. Beholde therfore thou deuote soule in to the face of thy sauiour Christ, and see in hym / how he dyd beare and suffre the payne of the crosse that thou shuld folow hym in bearyng the crosse / his bodie was naked, for our example that we shuld make our confession openly or plainly and nakedly to our gostlyfather without all clokyng or hydyng and excusyng of our synnes / his armes was spred abrode vpon the crosse redy to embrace the in a token that he wyl gladly receyue the vnto his grace, if thou forsake thy synne, he was fast nailed both in handes and feet: that thou shuld perseuer and continue in his loue and seruice / his hart was also openyd, for the effusion of the price of our redemption / As ye shall see in the next article. ¶Here folow .iii. lessons. THe fyrste lesson of this article is that we shulde dye with Christe, that is from the worlde and synne if we wyll lyue with hym in glorie eternall.Scda Tim̄. 2. C. And here vnto saynt Paule sayth. Si commortui sumus cum Christo: et conuiuemus. If we dye with Christe we shall lyue with Christe. And in an other place. Mortui enim estis et vita vestra abscondita est cum Christo in deo.Colos. 3. A. ❧ ✚ ☞ Ye be deade fromme the worlde and all
vayne or transitorie thynges, and your lyfe is hyd with Christ in god. The second lesson is, that it is very good and profitable, to say deuotely those .x. psalmes, cōmonly called the psalmes of the passion, which Christ sayd in his prayer hangyng vpon ye crosse for without doute, who so reades or sayes them deuoutly shal finde great conforthe. Thyrdlie euery christian at his death shulde vse and keape the forsaid .v. thynges, that Christ dyd at his death, he dyd pray, crie, weape, commendyd his soule to his father, and gaue vp his spirite. So we at our death shulde pray / crye to our lorde for his helpe, at leste in hert, wepe for our synnes by trewe contricion / commend our soule to god, and to gyue vp our spirit, that is with a good will to dye and so to conforme our wyll to the will of god. A man to conforme hym selfe to this article: may ofte remembre these lessons with ye premisses sayd in this article / and pray as foloweth. ¶A Lesson O Blissed Iesu which for me, dyeng vpon ye crosse, dyd com∣mend thy soule to thy father: graunt to me that I may spi∣ritually so dye to the and with the in this life: that it wold please the at the houre of my death to haue my wretched soule recōmen∣dyd to the, which liues and reignys with god the father and the holy ghost world without ende. Amen. ¶The openyng of Christes side and hert with a spere the .lxiii. Article. THe .lxiii. Article is the openynge or wondyng of Christes hert with a spere.Mat. 27. F▪ For at ye death of Christ there ware shewed many miracles, as ye derknes of the sōne, ye cuttyng of ye veyle in ye temple, ye rentyng or breakyng of the stonys, the openyng of the monu∣mentes or grauys, the conuersion of the noble man and capiteyn Centurio / the conuersion of the thefe & of many other, that seyng these great thynges that ware done, knocked vpon there brestes / in sygne or token of penaunce, and returned homewardes, his moste heuy mother there abidyng with a fewe women with her. The Iues then bicause it was the sabboth euyn, that the bodyes shulde not remayne vpon the crosse on the saboth day (for that sab∣both day was an high day and festfull with them) they I say be∣soughtIoh. 19. F.
Pilate that theyr legges myght be broken and so taken downe of the crosse / then camme the sawgyours and brake the legges of both the theuys. And when they camme to Iesus, and saw that he was deed alredie: they brake not his legges, for as the legges of the paschall lambe ware not broken: no more ware the legges of Christ, that is the true lambe of god / and in that was the scripture fulfylled that saith.Exo. xii. G os non comminuetis ex eo. He shall not breake a bone of hym.Ioh. 19. F. But there cam one of the sawgi∣ours with a spere / and dyd thrust Christ in to the side and forth∣with there came out blode and watre. This sawgior was called Longius and he was blinde or at lest his sight was but weke and what tyme he had thrust Christ to the hert with his spere: ye blode runnyng downe by the speare vnto his handes, he (not knowing the vertue therof) touched or rubbed his yen with his blody hādes and so had his syght clerely gyuen to hym. Also of this blode and watre; all the sacramentes of ye churche haue theyr efficacitie ver∣tue and strenght,Super dist. 2. 4. sen. as by theyr meritoriouse cause. As the mayster of the sentence sayth and all doctours. And though at that tyme the deed bodye of Christ could feale no payne: yet ye Iues did this thing of a great malice and to the great rebuke of Christ, for they ware not aciate and content with the obprobries / rebukes and paynes that they put hym to in his lyfe: but that also they wolde put hym to more and so persew hym after his death. And for that cause this wondyng of Christes syde is taken here for a speciall article of Christes passion / for all ye cruelties / shames and despites that be done to ye deed corpes or corse / be acompted as if they ware done to the persones lyuyng. As somtyme the bodyes of deed per∣sones: be drawen / hangyd / headyd, quarteryd, or burned: for the correction and punishment of suche defawtes as those persones dyd in ther liues. And though Christ that tyme deed, felt not that wounde of his syde: yet the blessyd virgyn his mother felt it, for that spere then dyd perse her most sorowfull soule / as saynt Ber∣nard sayth, truly. O blessid mother, than the swerde of sorow did perse thy soule: when that cruell spere openyd thy son syde, after his death. His soule then was not present with his bodye. But thy soule myght not be departed from it, for ye soule is rather there where it louyth: than where it gyuith life / & so not without great cause, we say that thou art more than a martyr, for the effecte of compassion in the: dyd exceade the fealyng of all bodilye paynes. ¶Of the miracles that ware done at this tyme: we shall speake, in the begynnyg of the thyrd parte of this myrrour / boke or / treatesse.
OF this wounde of the side of our lorde / the deuote and holy saynt Bernard saith thus. O good Iesu, thy side was woū¦ded and openid: that we myght haue entrance or a way to cumme to the. Thy hert was woūded: that we absolued from al outward trobles and busines myght reste and abyde therin. It was also wounded: that by that visible wounde: we myght see the inuisible wounde of thy loue / for who so euer feruently louith, he is woun∣ded with loue. And how myght his burnyng loue be more clerelie and openly declared to vs: but in that yt he wold not onely haue his bodie outwardly woundyd: but also haue his hart wounded with a spere / therfore this bodely wounde: doth shewe to vs his spiritual wounde of loue. Arise therfore thou spouse of Chryst, as a doue buyidyng thy nest and restyng place in the deapnes of this hole or wounde there watche cōtinually as a sparow fynding thy nest! there hyd thy birdes of chaste loue with the turtyll. Ioyne or put thy mouth to that wounde: that thou may sucke or drawe the watre of helth from ye foūtayns of our sauiour. This is ye wel that spryngeth in ye myddest of paradise / whiche doth make frute∣full the deuoute hertes and plentiously doth watre all the world. This is the doore that was made in the side of the arke of Noe / by the which dyd entre all tho bestes & men that ware sauyd from the vnyuersall flode. Studie and laboure therfore with all thy diligence to haue a recourse vnto the holes of this stone and vnto the caue or den in this stony wall both now in this life and also at thy death / there to rest and hide thy selfe / that thou myght escape the daunger of the wode lion the deuyl, and also that thou myght fynde there plentiouse pasture and fode to thy eternall comforth. ¶And here note that Christ dyd shedde his blode .v. tymes this day for vs. Fyrst in his prayer, when he swet blode. Second, in his scourgyng. Thyrd, in his crownyng with thornys. Fourth, in his naylyng to the crosse, and. Fyfth, in the openyng of his syde as ye haue herde before. ¶Here folow .ii. Lessons. FYrste lesson of this article is this, that whan we be deade with Christe from the worlde and from all synne then also we shuld be wounded in our hert with the spere of charitie so that we myght say with ye spouse in her canticles.Canti. 2. A. iuxta. 70. Vulnerata charitate ego sum. I am wounded with ye spere of charitie. Saynt Austen also desired to be wounded with this spere sayng. I besech the my
lord and kyng, my most swete Iesu for thy moste holye wondes, which thou suffered vpon the crosse for our health, from ye which that most preciouse blode ran out wherwith we be redemyd. I besech the (I saye) to wounde this my synfull soule for the which it pleasyd the to dye. Wounde it I besech the, with the fiery dart of thy most myghtie loue and charitie. Nayle fast my hert to the with the nayle or dart of thy loue, that my soule may say vnto the, I am wounded with charitie / and so sore wounded: that from this wounde of thy loue there myght runne the full ri∣uers of teares / both nyght and day, both of cōtricion / compassion and deuocion. Smyte I beseach the good Iesu this moste hard flynt my soule, with the myghty and sharpe spear of thy loue: that it may myghtilie entre in to ye inwardnes or deapnes of my hard hart. The second lesson is that we shuld receyue the sacramentes of the churche with that intent and deuocion: as if they cam then from the syde and hert of our lorde, for that wounde of his syde: was as the doore wherby ye sacramentes of the churche com from Christ to vs.Aug{us} su{per}. For as of the syde of our fyrst Adam sleapynge, his wyfe Eua was formed and made:Ioh. tract. Ca. xx. so of ye syde of our second Adam (that is Christ) sleapyng by death vpon the crosse was formed the churche / the spouse of Christ. By this woūde as by a dore of loue saynt Austen dyd entre when he sayde,In Manu∣ali. Ca. 23. Longyne hath openyd to me the syde of Christ with a spear / and I haue entred therin and there I surely and quietly reast. The nayles and the spear crie to me that I am truly reconsiled to Christ: if I loue hym. ¶A prayer. O Iesu which for me wold haue ye syde of thy deed bodie ope∣nyd, from whens cam plentye of blode and watre for our health & comforth: wounde (I beseach the) my hert with the spear of thy charitie, yt I may worthely receyue thy sacramētes, which flowed out of that thy most holie syde. Amen. ¶How the bodie of Christ was taken downe of the crosse the .lxiiii. Article. THe .lxiiii. article is the takyng downe of Christes bodie from the crosse. For after that our sauiour Iesus had gyuen vp his spirite vpon ye crosse: that was about the ix. houre of the day: the bodie of Christ hang styll vpon the crosse vnto euensong tyme / and there abode and taried our
blessid ladie and other .iii. women sittyng by the crosse / and not knowyng what to doo, they wold haue taken downe the bodye / and haue buried it: but they had no strenght therunto, nor yet such instrumentes as ware necessarie for that purpose. And to de∣parte leuyng the bodie vpon the crosse: they durste not / and there to tary or abide ye nyght drawyng nygh: they myght not. Behold and considre (thou deuote soule) in what proplexitie they be in and haue compassion on them with all thy herte. And as they sat thus in troble and heuines there cam Ioseph of ye citie of Aromathya somtyme called Ramatha, where as Helchana and Anna the pa∣rentes of the prophet Samuell dwellyd.Prīo regū. pri. A. This Ioseph was a riche man and of noble blode and also he was a senatour / and had great office in ye courte of the emperour, a good man in hym selfe and in ye syght of god, iuste to his neyghbour, a disciple of Christ, but secreate, for feare of the Iues, he had a truste to come to the kyngdome of god for he dyd in no thyng consent to the cowncell and those maliciouse actes of the Iues.St Math. Ca. 27. And as saynt Hierom sayth ye fyrst psalme was made of hym. Beatus vir. &c. This holie Ioseph strenghthed thorow theffusion of Christes blode (all feare set a part) went boldly vnto Pilate, not fearyng the malice of the Iues, nor yet the powre of Pilate, and asked of hym the bodie of Iesu, for a great treasure, for he preferryd that bodye aboue all erthly treasures though they be neuer so preciouse. Pilate merue¦lyd that Iesus was so soon deed, and called to hym a capten of an hundreth men, and asked of hym if Iesus ware deed / and whan he knew the treuth by that capteyn: he gaue the bodie to Ioseph. And then Ioseph bought a fayre lynyn clothe for to wrap Christ{is} bodie therin. And so Ioseph came, not now as a secreat and pre∣uy disciple of Christ: but an open disciple of Iesu. And also there cam with hym. Nichodemus, which bifore tyme cam priuely vn∣to Iesus in the nyght for feare of the Iues, but now all feare set a parte he cam with Ioseph and brought with hym / of myrre and aloes about an hūdreth pownde weight, to anoynt and dresse the bodie of Christ before his buriyng. And when they cam nyghe to the place where Christ hang: they kneled down / and dyd worship our lorde. And our ladie perceyuyng that they cam to take downe her sōnys bodie (as risyng frō death) her spirit began to quicken, and so our ladie receyuyd them at theyr cōmyng reuerently. And furthwith they prepared them selfe: to take down the bodye, and our ladie healped as moch as she myght. One drewe the nayles out of his handes / an other susteyned the bodie that it shulde not
fall downe, our Lady standyng: lifted vp her armes on heyght, redy to receyue the body when it shuld com downe, and as shortly as she myght touche hym: she drew his heade and his handes vp∣on her sorowfull breste embrasyng and ofte kyssyng his wondes wherwith she culde not be saciate, and what tyme the bodie was taken downe: this blessed Lady toke his heade and his shulders in to her lappe, and Mary Maglene, toke his feet, remembryng what grace and comforth she founde by them and all the residue that stode about: greatly lamentyd and morned his death. ¶The lamentacion and mournyng of our Lady. SAynt Bernard speakyng of this lamentacion of our Lady / sayth.In libro de plāctu vir∣ginis. She lifted vp her handes on height, em∣brasynge and kyssynge the body of her sonne / but her sonne dyd not embrase her agayne for his armes ware to stiffe or starke therunto. And then that blessid vir∣gyn seyng she culd haue none other solace dyd kysse with a great and faruent desire his woundes and the blode that ran from his woundes. In so moch that the face of this sorowfull Lady was made all blodie with the blode of her sonne slayne which thyng in it selfe was very pitifull and moch lamentable to behold, that is / that so noble a bodie shuld be so shamefully entreated, as though it had ben the most vile carion / and yet in truth: that bodie myght neuer fall to corrupcion, for the godhed was continually ioyned therunto / which keapte it from al corrupcion. And for this cause / this article is nowmbred among the articles of Christes passion though this bodye when it was deed felt no payne, but yet this blessid virgyn at this time suffred the payne for she was there pre¦sent with other deuote women. And then Ioseph meakly desired our Lady / that she wolde suffre ye body of her sōne to be anoynted and wrapped in the lynen clothes, and so to be buried, but she re∣fusyd to be so shortly departed from her sonne, & when they wold haue buried hym: she wold haue retayned hym, and so there was a godly and a pitiouse cōtencion bitwixt them. And at last though not gladly: yet reuerently, she suffred them to take the bodie at theyr pleasure. Then this blessid virgyn weapt without com∣forth, and so such aboundaūce of teares flowed from her ien, that it myght be supposed▪ that all her bodie ware turned to watre. She washed her face with tearis and also the deed bodie of her sonne & specially his woundes, and also the stone vpon the which
the bodie was layd when it as washed. And it is sayd that her teares don yet appere and may be seen vpon yt same stone which is in the entraūce of the churche of the holy sepulcre. She washed and dried his blody woūdes, and kyssed them and oftymes she be∣held his most holie face / his woūdes and his heade, and there she see the prickynges of the thornys, and how the heare was pulled from his berde and also his heade / she beheld his face (I say) how it was defoyled with blode and the spittynges of the Iues and so she culd not be saciat with seyng and weapyng / her sorow myght be perceiued: but it culd not be declared as it was: but she felt it to the extremitie. ¶Here folow .iii. lessons. THe fyrst lesson of this article is that the faythfull people receyuynge the bodie of our lorde in the sacrament of the aulcer: be compared to them that toke hym of the crosse / and it is more, to take him in the sacrament of the aulter: than downe from the crosse, for they that toke hym of the crosse toke hym onely in there armes and handes, but we receyue hym in to our mowthes and hertes. And as they dyd weappe that bodye in a fayre lynon cloth: so shulde we receyue hym in to a pure hert and clene consci∣ence. The secōd lesson is, that when we be com to that perfection that we be deed to the world, and to all synnes, so that our bodie be deed (as saynt Paule sayth of Abraham and Sara) then we may sumwhat release of the rigor of our penaunce and crosse,Ro. iiii. D. so our lorde wold not discend from his crosse in the tyme of his lyfe: but when he was deed he suffred his body to be taken downe. The thyrd lesson is, that we shuld gladly take Christ of the crosse with Ioseph. Aslong as the synner continueth in synne: as moch as is in hym he byndeth Christe and nayleth hym fast to the crosse. For our synnes ar the cause why Christ was crucified. But as shortly as we be turned by true penaūce vnto christ: we lowce him & take him of the crosse and receyue hym bytwyxt our armes and hādys as Ioseph dyd. And as ye see, that he which hath an other man bitwixt his armes may doo with hym what it shall please hym, if the other man resiste not: so the penitent synner embrasing Christ in his armes of loue: may doo with Christe, and get of hym what so euer he requireth to his soules health. For Christ wyll not re∣siste the penitēt. For he is more redy to giue grace: than the other is to receyue it. And a man to conforme hym selfe to this article shuld ofte remembre these lessons, and pray thus.
¶A prayer. O Iesu which for me a wretched synner, after thy death wold haue thy bodie taken downe from the crosse by Ioseph and Nicodemus, and so be anoynted and dressed with swete oynt∣mētes and spices, wold be wrapped in fayre lynen clothes: graūt to me worthely to receyue thy blessed very leuyng bodie in the sa∣crament of the aulter, as if I shuld take hym of the crosse, and so to anoynte hym with the oyntmentes of vertues, that I may con∣tinually keape hym in a pure hert and chaste bodie. Amen. ¶Of the buriyng of Christes bodie the .lxv. Article. THe .lxv. and the laste article is the buriynge of the bodie of Christ. For after it was taken of the crosse / and dressyd with spices and swete oyntmentes and also wrapped in fayre lynen clothes as we sayd be∣fore: then they went aboute to bury hym. And the time passing: Ioseph meakely desired our Lady that she wold suffre the bodie to be buried before that the saboth day shuld en∣tre, for then it shuld be vnlawfull for them to doo any such labour or busynes. And then our lady very gently and discreatly ordred hyre selfe to them, and so crossyng and blessing that body though with great sorow: yet reuerētly she suffred them to take the body and bury it.Ioh. 19. D. And as the Euangelist sayth. Erat in loco vbi cruci∣fixus est: ortus, et in orto: monumentum nouum. &c. In the place where Iesus was crucified: there was a garden, aud in that gar∣den: a new sepulcre or graue cut or hewen out of a rocke of stone, and it apperteyned to the same Ioseph.Math. 27. G. And in this new tumbe: they buryed the bodie of Iesu. And here sayth Simon de Cassia, that Christ praynge dyed, and after his death: he was put in a garden,Li. xiii. in fine. that by his prayer and death: there myght sprynge to vs the plantes of vertues of his inuisible garden / and that ther∣by we myght deserue to entre the garden of heuenly pleasures, moch more pleasaunt than that garden of paradise that was pre∣pared of god for our fyrst parentes in the este part of the worlde. This new sepulcre also was conuenient for our new Adam,I ibidem. that his buriyng myght reanswear to his incarnacion. For when he was incarnate: he was put in to the wombe of a virgyne, where neuer man was before / nor shuld be after hym and so was he put in a new graue where as neuer man was put before. Also he was buried in an other mānys sepulcre for he had none of his owne /
nor wold haue. For he yt came to gyue hym selfe to the comforthe of man: wolde haue no erthly thyng propre to hym selfe. It was not conueniēt for hym that cam to gyue vs heuenly thynges, that he shulde labour for any propertie in erthly thynges, and therfore he made poore for vs from his natiuytie vnto his death: dyd kepe a poore lie,1. Cor. x. A. and free from all propertie in worldly thynges. He was also buried in a sepulcre of stone,Math. 16. C. this stone signified Christ, vpon the which stone is stablished ye sure foundacion of our faith.Nu. 20. B. Also he was buried in a stone: for many misteries. This is the stone that gaue watres plentiously vnto the people of god in the desert. This is the stone that gaue furth riuers of oyle vnto Iob. This is the stone vpon the which a man is exalted and fixed in the tribulacions and anguishes of his hert,Psal. lx. to his great comforth and defence,Psal. C. iii. if he cum therto by sure fayth. This is the stone that is the refuge and comforth vnto penitent synners / that be full of prickes (that is,Psal. 139. contricion for theyr synnes) as the hurchen is full of prickes. This is also the stone: agaynste or vnto the which the yong spryng of our synnes be caste and all to crushed and broken or destroyed, that is, our euyll cogitacions / at the begynnyng of them, or fyrst mocion before they encrease in vs they shuld be cast agaynst this stone, remembring the death and burying of Christ, and so auoyde and destroy them. In to this stone they put the body of Christ which was the lorde and gyuer of lyfe.Math. xxvii. G. And when they had buried hym then Ioseph rolled or put to the dore of the sepul∣cre a great stone and so departed.Li. xiii. in fine. As Simon de Cassia saith, this stone put to the doore of the sepulcre: doth signifie the infidelitie of the Iues, and the hardnes of theyr hertes, for nother they wold cease from theyr euyll workes, nor yet leaue theyr obstinate and froward hertes. This stone was put to the seulcre: by ye handes of men: but it was remouyd by aungelles / to signifie that by his owne euyll deades a mam may fall to obstinacie and heardnes of hert. But that can nat be remouyd but by the pouer and vertue of god. If the question be mouyd why this article is nombred a∣mong the articles of the passion of Christe / seyth Christe beynge deed suffred no payne therby? It may be answeryd that one of the miseries of our corrupt nature is, that the body will putrifie after the death, and therfore it must be buryed. And though this reason haue no place in Christ, for his body shuld neuer haue ben putret¦fied / as the prophet sayth.Psal. xv. Non dabis sanctum tuum videre corrup∣tionem. Thou shall not suffre thy holie sonne to see the putrefac∣tion of his bodie: yet for asmoche as the Iues had brought this
body of Christ to that cōdicion, that it seamed necessarie to bury it, and also that the Iues wolde nat haue ben otherwise conten, excepte it had ben buried: therfore it is cōueniently accompted as an artycle. And also for that, there folowed this buriyng .ii. great thynges / that is the lamētacion and mournyng of our Lady and the other women, and also ye watche and keapyng of the sepulcre. Fyrst (I say) for the lamentacion of the blessyd virgyn and other women, by whose lamentacions ware fulfylled the lamentacions that the prophet Hieremy wrote vpon the death of the good kyng Iosias. The sorowful mother of god myght fyrst direct her wor∣des to the father of heuyn and say.In libro. Treno{rum}. Alas, my lord god, why hast thou gyuen to me a son to die so miserably, and so to leaue me be∣hynd hym al desolate and ful of sorowe and heuines. &c? Second∣ly she myght speake to Gabriel ye archaungell. O Gabriell where is the glad tidynges that thou shewed to me? I fynde no ioy: but most bitter sorow. Thyrdly she myght speake to Iohan the euan∣geliste and to other women that ware with her, and say / if ye loue me, if ye haue any compassion of me: I charge you that ye bury me with hym. These and other like, this sorowful mother myght haue sayd. The second thyng that folowyd this buriyng: was the watche and keapyng of the sepulcre by the saugiours. And hereof the euangelist sayth thus.Math. xxvii. G. Altera autem die que est post parasceuem dixerunt principes sacerdotum et pharisei ad Pilatum. Domine re∣cordati sumus {quod} seductor ille. &c. The next day after good friday / the princes of pristes and the phariseis cam to Pilate and sayd. Lord, or sir, we remembre that this deceyuer sayd, whyle he was yet aliue. After .iii. dayes. I wyll arise agayne. Commaunde therfore that the sepulcre be made sure and keapt vnto the thyrd day, lesse paraduenture his disciples come and stele hym a waye and say to the people that he is arisen from death. And then the laste erroure shalbe worse than the fyrst. This the Iues dyd fyrst to shewe the malice of theyr hertes. And therefore Symon de Cassia sayth.Li. xiii. in fine. This is a great iniquitie of men, a great enuy of the Iues, that they do nat cease to persue and falsly accuse ye innocent deed, callyng Christ after his death, a deceyuer / and that also they spake before the iudge, which had prouyd the contrarie / they had don to moche before in yt they falsly accused hym in many thyng{is} and moreouerby theyr importune clamoures and criynges had made hym to be cōdempned vnto a most shameful death.Ibidem. Second¦ly, they dyd thus for theyr owne excusaciō. For as ye same Simon de Cas. sayth. It is ye cōdicion of an enuiouse {per}son: euer to speke
euyl of that person whom he hateth, and though he haue slayne or hurte that person whom he so hateth: yet he wyll neuer speake of hym, but with obprobriouse and euyl wordes, that therby he may be Iudged to be good and ryghtuouse: for asmoch as he {per}se weth that person that was euyll and vnryghtuouse, and so he cloketh, hideth and coloreth his enuy by false crymes that he putteth vpon the innocent. But for al that, the conscience of such euyl persones be euer more in feare for they knowe that they do euyll / but by∣cause they wyll not haue theyr malyce knowen: they cease nat to falsly accuse theyr enymy also after his death. And so theys false Iues euer repete theyr false accusacions: bycause they wold nat be noted as confounded. O blynd malyciouse people. In all theyr euyll deades agaynst Christe they go to the Iudge Pylate, that theyr iniquitie and synne shuld seme as iustice: bycause it is doon by auctoritie. And they called hym Domine, that is lorde, but they wold neuer obey to hym with theyr good wyl. It is the propertie of maliciouse and froward persons to prayse hym byfore his face whom they hate in theyr hertes,Math. xxvii. G. and that is to brynge theyr pur∣pose to passe. Then Pylate sayd to them. Habetis custodiam. Ite custodite sicut scitis. Ye haue there the watche men, take them and goo and make the sepulcre as sure as ye can. As if he shulde say after Rabanus.Thōs su{per}. It myght be sufficient to you that I haue cōsen∣tyd vnto the death of this innocent,Math. 27. from hens fourth do what ye wyll, your errour shall reste vpon your selfe. And then they went and made the sepulcre sure with watch men and sealyd the stone. This was doon for .ii. causes. Fyrst to shew the folishenes of the Iues.Super. Math. in fin. And herunto saynt Hillarie sayth. The feare that the Iues had of the steylynge of Christis body, the watche men and the sealyng of the stone: be a testimonie and a witnes of ye infidelitie and folyshues of the Iues. Was it not a great folishnes of them / to watche and seale his sepulcre that a lytil before that tyme com∣maūded a deed man to rise out of his sepulcre / the which was .iiii. dayes buried? Secondly this was doon for the more sure testi∣mony of the truthe that is of the resurrection of Christ. And herof Crisostome sayth.Thōs su{per}. Considre and note well here how the Iues a∣gaynste theyr owne myndes doo labour to shewe and proue the truth agaynst them selfe. For this theyr acte is a manifeste and sure proue of ye resurrection of Christ. And thus we may proue it. The sepulcre was sealed and surely keapte wt saugioures: ergo / there culd be no crafte or deceyte. If theyr ware no deceyte: ergo Christ is surely risen / for there is the sepulcre, & the body is gon.
¶Here folow .iii. lessons. FYrst Lesson is that we shuld be the folowers of Ioseph, in that, that when the bodye of Christe is receyued of vs and wrapped as we sayd before: then we shuld lay it or put it in a new sepulcre cut out or hewen out of a stone / that is we shuld put it in our soule deckyd and beautised with the ymage of god, renewed and stablisshed in Christ,Can. 3. B. which is the sure stone, so that we may say that is wrytten in the canticles. Tenui eum nec dimittam. I haue hym I holde hym and I wyll not leaue hym. The seconde Lesson is this that as our lorde was tormentyd crucified / deed, lamentyd or mournyd and also buryed: so we shuld lament hym by compassion and compunction. Thyrd lesson is for riche men, which by the example of Ioseph ought to couer the nakydnes of Christ in the poore men, and so bury Christ in the sepulcre of his herte by charitable werkes doyng to the poore people. ¶A prayer. O Iesu which for me at the houre of complen wold be buryed in a sepulcre lamentyd and keapte: graunt to me that thou my lord god may be buryed in the sepulcre of my hert and there lamentyd and keapt that I buried with the: may deserue to com to the glory of thy resurrection. Amen. ¶Here endyth the seconde parte of this Glasse or Myrour. ¶Here foloweth the thyrd parte / that is the conclu∣sion of this Myrrour, Which is diuided in to .xi. Chaptres. ¶Fyrst we shall declare vnto you certen Myracles, & specially. x. that were done, som of them at the death of our lorde, and som of them after his death. The fyrst Chapitre. ¶Of the fyrste Myracle.
THe fyrst Myracle was theclipse or derknes of the son / and of this,Math. 27. E. the euangeliste saith thus. A sex∣ta autem hora tenebre facte sunt super vniuersam terram vsque ad horam nonam. From the sexte houre vnto the .ix. houre of the daye there was derknes ouer all the worlde or erthe. And this derkenes or eclipse was nat naturall, but onely by miracle. And that we may proue by .iiii. reasons. Firste by reason of the long enduryng of the same for the eclipse of the son naturally may neuer endure by .iii. cōtinual houres as this was. Second reason is bicause it was so vniuersal for naturally there can be no eclipse of the son ouer all the erth, for the mone that let∣tyth the lyght of the son from vs for the tyme of the eclipse: is not of so great quantitie as is the son nor yet as the erth and therfore it can nat take away ye lyght of the son from all partes of the erth, but this derknes or eclipse was ouer all the erth, ergo it was nat naturall. Thyrd reason is for the age of the mone, the mone at that tyme was encreasyd .xiiii. dayes, and so it was almost at the full mone. But it is impossible that there shuld any eclipse of the son naturally in the opposicion of the mone or it beyng at the ful / for then the mone is in the Est when ye son is in the West. And al∣so euery naturall eclipse of the son is the coniuncion or chaunge of the mone. Forth reason is this, for in this eclipse: the mone at nyght turnyd and mouyd toward the Eest,Glosa īter∣earis. s̄ Math. 27. 1. and the son towardes the Weste, which can neuer be naturally / ergo this eclipse was by miracle. But for what cause / god wolde shewe this miracle then: doctoures done assigne .v. causes. Fyrst for the compassion of the elementes, which myght nat beare or suffre to see the iniurie that was done to there creatour and maker. Secondly to shewe that Christ was the gouernar of all creatures. And here vnto saynt Gregory sayth. This wondre or miracle was shewed / that it shulde be knowen that he which suffred death was the gouernar of all thynges. Thyrdly. It was to shewe the blyndnes of mānys reason,Libro. xiii. and here vnto Simon de Cassia sayth. Derknes was brought ouer all the world: to shewe ye ignorance of all the world, for the world wold nat knowe the son of god. Forthly for the ob∣stinacie of the Iues.Ibidem. For as the same Simon saith, the Iues suf∣fred horrible derkenes, for they blynded in theyr hertes by malice: condempned the son of god. Fystly, for the cōtemplacion of many secreat misteries.Ibidem. And therfore saith ye same Simon This dark∣nes besides that / yt it shewed outwardly: it also mouyd the mind{is}
of men to considre higher thinges, for our lord wold meruelously compasse ye ien of men with thycke derknes: that theyr syght shuld not be wanderyng about outwarde thynges, but that they shuld entre in to theyr owne hertes & there cōsidre deaply such thynges as waxe don to the son of god and in the son of god, and so he tur∣nyd the day in to the nyght yt they myght more diligently cōsidre the heuenly mysteries. ¶Of the seconde Myracle. THe seconde Myracle was cuttyng or rentyng of the vayle of ye temple,Math. xxvii. F. which was immediatly after the death of Christ. Of the which Mathew sayth thus. Ecce velum templi scissum est in duas partes a summo vsque deorsum.Math. xxvii. F. Behold the vale of the temple was rent in to .ii. partes fro the top vnto the bottom. This vayle deui∣dyd the part of the temple that was called holye: from that part which was called holiest of all, as we myght say in our church it deuided, the body of the church: from the quere. And this veyle was rent for many causes. Fyrst for the contamination / or (as we say) suspension of that holiest place of all other.Tho. in ca∣thena super Luce. xxiii. For where before no man myght entre in to it but the highe byshop ons in the yere: now it was made open, and so was gyuen to the power of the Ro∣manys to be contaminate and defoiled by them.Omelia. xxxv. Secondly, for to signifie the reuelacion and declaring of misteries. For as Origen sayth.Super. Math. In the passion of our lord, when the veyle was rent: the se∣creat misteries was poblished and opened, which vnto that tyme was reasonably hydde and couered.su{per}. Math. in fine. Thyrdly for the separacion / dispersion and diuision of the Iues. And hervnto saynt Hillary saith, therfore the veyle of ye temple is rent: for that after this, the people of the Iues shuld be deuided in partes, and shortly after: they ware disperpled ouer all the worlde. Also the honour and glorie of the temple with the custodye of aungelles ware taken a∣way.Libro. vii. de bel. Iuda ico. Ca. xii. Iosephus saith, that there ware stirrynges mouinges and voyces hard in the temple, saiyng & cryenge. Let vs departe from this place.Super. Mar. xv. Fourthly, to sygnifie ye openyng of heuyn which vnto that tyme was shut. And herto saynt Hierom saith. The veyle of the temple was rent, that is, heuyn is openyd. Fyftly: to signifie the curaciō of our synnes / Herunto Theophilus sayth.Thomas. Super. Mar. xv. The body of Christ is ye temple whose veyle and garment: is his fleshe, and this veyle or fleshe was rent for ye curing of our sinnes. Or thus.
Our fleshe or bodie is the veyle of our temple that is our soule, the vertue and poure of this fleshe was rent in Christes passion, from the toppe vnto the bottom, that is from Adam the fyrst man vnto the laste man that shalbe in the ende of the worlde for Adam was made hole by the passion of Christ, and his fleshe is not now vnder the curse of god or of the lawe, and after the general resur∣rection we all shalbe honored with incorrupcion & inmortalitye. ¶The thyrd Myracle. THe thyrd Myracle was the erth quake / and therfore the euangelist saith.Math. xxvii. F. Et terra mota est. And the erth was mouyd or dyd quake. And that was for .iii. causes. Fyrst to shewe that it was not worthy to receyue in to it this lorde.Super. Math. in fine. And therfore Hillarius sayth, the erth dyd quake: for he was not able to take this deed body in to it. Seconde cause is for the malyce of the Iues. Herunto Symon de Cassia saith. It was cōuenient that the erthe shulde quake:Libro. xiii. when the maker of the erth dyd suffre death in his corporall bodie. The erth dyd quake at the gyuyng of the law, to make them afraied to whom he gaue the law and which shuld breake the law. The erth dyd also quake at the death of Christ: that his vniust death shuld be knowen or felt thorowe out all the world. Thyrd cause was to instructe the myndes of all faithful people, that they shuld feare god and know and beleaue: that the iuste person suffred death for the vniuste, the godly: for the wicked / the holy person: for synners, and the son of god suffred death in his mortal bodie, for the redempcion of man. ¶The forth Myracle. THe Fourth Myracle was the rentynge or breakynge of the stonys.Math. xxvii. F. For the euangelist sayth. Et petre scisse sunt. And the stonys ware rent or broken. And that was for iiii. causes. Fyrste for therby was verified the sayng of the prophet Zachary.Ca. xiiii. A. Scindetur mons oliuarum ex media parte sui ad orientem et occidentem. The mount of Oliuete shalbe rent or broken for the myd parte of it from the Este to the West. Second cause is to signifie the great vertue of the worde of god. And here vnto saynt Hillary sayth.Super. Math. in fie. E. The worde of god and the powre of his eterne vertue doth diuide and breake all strong & hard or myghty thynges.Libro. xiii. Thyrd cause, was to confoūd the Iues. For as Simon
de Cassia sayth. The breakyng and rentyng of stones: is na open crye and an accusacion of the insensible thynges agaynste the Iues, that the gyuer of life and maker of all thynges is vniustly dampned. The Iues dyd crie with lowde voice, crucifie hym, but now the stonys on theyr maner dyd crye by theyr partes broken as by theyr open lippys, that the Iues did wrong and so wher as the reasonable men wold not answere for the truthe in this false condempnacion of Iesu: the stonys rent or broken in theyr maner spake. The .iiii. cause was to enflame the hertes of synners. For as the same Symon sayth.Ibidem. The stonys rent or broken in theyr maner dyd prouoke the hard hartes of men, that they shuld be broken by contricion and also remembre hym that suffred such paynes and passyon for them. ¶The .v. Myracle. THe .v. Myracle was the openyng of the sepulcres or graues.Math. xxvii. F. And therfore theuangelist sayth. Et monumen∣ta aperta sunt. And ye supulcres or graues ware openid. And this was for .iii. causes. Fyrst to shew that the prison of hell was openyd,su{per}. Math. in fine. for as saynt Hillary sayth. Then was the clausures of death openyd. Secondly for the example of our resurrection. For this was a token or signe that deed men shuld rise agayne ac¦cordyng to the sayng of the prophet.Ezech. 37. D. Ego aperiam tumulos vestros. I shall open your grauys. Thyrdly for our spirituall instruc∣cion. For hereby we be lerned that we shuld open the sepulcres of our conscience / by true and playne confession that the carion and filthynes of our synnes may be seen and cast out. And here note that the myracle before the death of Christ: was shewed aboue in the heuyns. For by fore his death: Christe was in a maner onely knowen in heuyn. But the myracles after his death ware shewed and done in the erth, for then began the knowlege of Christ to be spred abrode vpon the erth. ¶The .vi. Myracle. THe .vi. Myracle was the risyng agayne of deed men.Math. xxvii. F. And therfore theuangelist sayth. Et multa corpora san∣ctotum qui dormierant: surrexerunt. &c. And the bodyes of many sayntes which ware deed: arose, and cam out of theyr graues after Christes resurrection, and cam into the holy citie of
Hierusalem, and apperyd to many. This testimony of the risyng of deed men is conuenient. Fyrst for theyr nombre, for they ware many. Secondly, for theyr condicyon, for they were holy and the bodyes of holy sayntes. Thyrdly for the noueltye, for they arose after theyr death and buriyng. Also for the tyme, for it was after the resurrection of Christ, for he was the first that rose. Fyftly for the holy place for they cam into the holy citye. And also for that they apperyd to many persones. ¶The .vii. Myracle. THe .vii. Myracle was the cōuersion of moch people. Of the which the euangelist sayth.Math. xxvii. F. Centurio et qui cum eo erant custodientes Iesum viso terre motu et hijs que fiebant: timuerunt valde dicentes. Vere filius dei erat iste. When Centurio (which was a capteyn of a .C. men) and they that were wt hym, watchyng and keapyng Iesus, sawe the erth quake and those thynges which happened then: they fearyd greatly and sayd, of a suerty this was the son of god. This Centurio and his compaygney confessyd Christ to be the son of god, and this was don for .v. causes. Fyrst for that he saw so many great myracles don, which mouyd hym to this con∣fession and fayth. Second was for the callyng of the paganes or gentylles to the fayth.Libro. xiii. Behold (sayth Simon de Cassia) a great mistery, that in the Natyuitie or byrth of our lorde, and also at his death: the gentylles dyd preuent the Iues and cam to the faith before them. For at the byrth of Christ the .iii. kynges and greate wyse men which cam from the Eest to worship Christe: dyd pre∣uent the Iues at that tyme. And now at his death this Centurio with his compaigney of Rome, that cam from the Weste: dyd al∣so first beleue. Thyrd reason was to reuok his errours. For now Centurio dyd glorifie god: that so had ordred his son to suffre death. He beleuyd in to god and glorifed hym beyng sory that he had obeyd to the president Pylate in so cruelly tormentynge the son of god and openly with his mouth he confessyd Christe to be iuste and innocent: whom the maliciouse Iues had falsly cōdemp∣ned as vniuste and worthy death. In lyke maner dyd his com∣paigney sayng the same with great feare & wondre, and so com∣myng to the knowlege of true fayth: deseruyd forgyuenes of theyr errours and infidelitie by the merit of the prayer of Christ, when he prayed for his crucifiers and sayd. Father forgyue them: they
know nat what they doo. Forth reason is for to confounde the he∣retikes.Super. Math. 27. And therefore saynt Hierom sayth. Note here that Cen∣turio a gentyll and pagane seyng Christe put to most shamefull death, yet for all that seyng such Myracles confessyd Christ to be the son of god, and Arrius a christen man. And a prest or doctor in the churche of Christe, dyd blaspheme Christe and say that he was a creature & not the natural son of god. Fyfth reason was for the informacion of vs christians.Sermone. xiii. de pas∣sione. di. Herunto sayth the holy pope Leo. Euery man shuld tremble and be afraed in ye remembraunce of the passion of his redemar Christ as Centurio was in ye syght therof the hard hertes of men shuld be broken as ware the stones, and they that be buried in the custom of synne: shuld cast away all obstacles & customs or occasiōs of syn and without tariyng aryse vp, and com vnto the holy citie / that is to the church & there be re∣consyled and so appere to many persones, that they may se and know you truly risen from ye death of synne vnto the life of grace, and so that which was doon corporally at the passion of Christe, may now be doon spiritually in our hertes and soulys by the re∣membraunce of the same passion. ¶The .viii. Myracle. THe .viii. Myracle was the very blode and very watre ranne out of Christes syde after his death. For as the euangelist sayth.Ioh. 19. F. Iudei autē quoniam parasceue erat. &c. The Iues bycause it was the sabboth euen, that the bodyes shuld not remayne and contynue vpon the crossys on the sabboth day (for that sabboth day was an hygh day and solempne fest with them) they (I say) besought Pylate that there legges myght be broken and so taken downe of the crosse. The Iues dyd make this desire to Pylate for .iiii.Libro. xiii. causes, of the which Symon de Cassia maketh mencion. Fyrst, for the reuerence of there fest∣full day. It was a meruelouse supersticion of the Iues (sayth he) that thought yt theyr sabboth day shulde be violate and defoyled: if the bodies of those which ware condempned to death: shulde hyng that day vpon ye crosse, but they had no conscience nor wold se the cōtaminacion and defoylyng of theyr owne soulys, whiche for enuy condempned the innocent falsly to death. Secondly it was for the vnquietnes of the people, that the Iues alledged for them to Pilate ye reuerence of the sabboth day (but in theyr hertes was hyd great malice) for they pretendyd that they wold haue his
body taken downe, lesse the people shuld be truobled and vnquie∣ted vpon the sabbot day which is a day of quietnes / but it was for the great signes and miracles that ware shewed at his death and after his death, and they thought that if the people shuld see the bodie hyng vpon ye crosse: that therby they remembryng all these signes: shuld shortly be mouyd to insurrection and agaynst them that condempned hym to death. Thyrdly for that they wold haue no mo myracles shewed. For they ware afrayd that if he conty∣nued long vpon the crosse: that there shulde haue ben many mo¦myracles shewed. Forthly they dyd it to auoyde perilles, for they councelynge to gether: decreyd wisely for them selfe corpo∣rally: that the bodies of the deed persones condempned to death shulde not be suffred to hyng long, for the auoydyng of many pe∣rillys that myght hap. It is the custome of wyse gouernars of any cōmynaltie to remoue or a voyde that person quicke or deed by whome they feare any troble to com. And therfore the princes of the Iues desyred Pylate, that theyr legg{is} myght be broken, and so taken downe. And then the sawgioures cam & brake the legg{is} of the .ii.Su{per}. Ioh. tractatu. C. xx. theuys, that was (as saynt Austen sayth) yt they myght the more shortly dye, and also for the commaūdement of the lawe / but when they cam to Iesus and se that he was deed all redy: they brake nat his legges.Deut. 21. D And that was for .ii.Ioh. 19. F. causes after Symon de Cassia.Libro. xiii. Fyrst for verifiyng of the figure, for here of we had a figure bifore in the paschall lambe, of whom it was commaūdyd that they shuld breake no bone of it.Exodi. 12. G. Nat so to be vnderstand that / that figure or commaundement was the cause that Christ bonys or legges ware nat broken: but contrary wise / bycause that god had so prouided that no bone shuld be broken in Christ: therfore it was commaundyd and keapt in the paschall lambe that was a figure of Christe. Secondly it was to sygnifie a thyng in the misticall body of our sauiour Christe, that is, that the bonys of this misticall body, which be the perfite men, shuld nat be broken or ouercum by īpacience in any tribulacion or aduersite / but that they shulde continue and abyde vnsuperable / redy to suffre all thynges vnto the death. And though sumtyme they be ouercum in body / that ther body is taken and put to prison and paynes: yet in mynde and good maners they be neuer ouercum nor broken. And therefore they brake nat Christes legges. But one of the sawgiours with a speare dyd thrust Christ to the hert, and furth with there cam out watre and blode. This man was claled Lon∣gius, and he dyd thus for the pleasure of the Iues which wold be
certified of his death. This Longyne was then a cruell and a wicked man, but afterward he was conuerted and dyed an holy martyr. It is sayd that his syght was very feble, and as the blode ran downe by the speare from the hert of Christe by chaunche it toched his yen: and furthwith he had his syght clerly, and so he beleauyd in Christe, lefte his sawgiourshyppe, and enstructe by the apostles in the fayth of Christ: he leuyd an holie monasticall lyue by the space of .xxxviii. yeares in the citie of Cesary in the county of Capadoce, and after that he had cōuerted moche peope to the fayth of Christ by his holie word and good example: at last he was put to death for the fayth of Christe. And that watre and blode cam out of the syde of Christe: it was done for .iii. causes. Fyrst for the multiplicacion of myracles. It was a boue nature / and a very myracle that pure and very blode / and pure and very watre shuld com out of any deed bodie. And note here that this blod and watre cam not myxte to gether: but fyrst, very pure blod and after that very pure watre.Libro. xiii. As Symon de Cassia sayth. Se∣condly it was done for the vertue of the sacramentes.Tract. 120. For of this wounde they had theyr efficacitie and vertue. And herunto saynt Austen sayth super Iohannem / the euangelist vsed here a very good and a discreat terme sayng. Aperuit latus eius. Non percussit nec vulnerauit. Saynt Iohan sayth that the sawgiour with his spear dyd open the syde of Christ, he doth nat say that he smote or wondyd it / but opened it, that he myght shew that, that wounde was as the dore of lyfe, from whens all sacramentes haue theyr vertue (as we sayd in the .lxiii. article) with out the which sacra∣mentes no man may entre in to ye eterne life, specially if they may be had. Thyrdly this was done to enflame our loue. And herunto saynt Austen sayth. One of the sawgioures dyd open Christes syde with a speare: that by yt open wounde we myght se and know the loue that Christ had in his hert to vs, and so therby loue hym the more strongly and faythfully. ¶The .ix. Myracle. THe .ix. Myracle was the buriyng of Christ, for it was a meruelouse rare and a thyng neuer hard or seen: that a person so vilely and rebukfully hangyd vpon the crosse as Christ was shuld be so honorally buryed of great and deuote persons / as he was. Of this buriyng, saynt Iohan sayth. Post hec rogauit Pilatum Ioseph ab Aromathia. &c.Ioh. 19. G. After that
Christ was deed: Ioseph of Aromathy desired Pylate to graunt and gyue to hym the bodie of Iesu. This peticion he made, for iiii. caues.Omel. 84. Fyrst, for (as Crisostome sayth) Ioseph supposed that the malice of ye Iues that they had agaynst Christ / had ben endyd seyng that they had crucified hym,Su{per}. Ioh. and therfore he went boldly to Pylate and asked ye body. Secondly: bycause of his familiarytie that he had with Christ, for he was the disciple of Christ thoughe then it was nat openly knowen.Libro. xiii. {pro}pe finem. Thyrdly, Ioseph was a good man and therfore he fearyd nat to do a good dede. Of his good∣nes Symon de Casia / sayth. We may nat iustly reproue this Io∣seph in any thyng: whome so seriously the euangelist Luke com∣mendith sayng.Luce. 23. G Ecce vir nomine Ioseph qui erat de curio, vir bonus et iustus. Hic non consenserat consilio et actibus eorum. &c. Behold (saith Luke) a man called Ioseph which was a noble man world∣ly,Beda su{per}. Lucam. Ca. 91. for he was of the ordre of the court / or of the councell of the em∣perour / a good man to god & iuste to his neighboures. This Io∣seph dyd nat consent to the counsell and actes or deades of ye Iues agaynst Christ / he dwellyd in Aromathy a citie of Iurie, and he trusted also and wayted for the kyngdom of god. Som sayth he was decurio bycause he was a captayne ouer .x. men. And this office agreith to a mistery, for he keapt the .x. commaundementes of god, and thus for his goodnes he was bolde to aske of Pylate the body of Iesus. Forthly it was for his dignytie, for as we sayd before, he was a noble man and riche, and well accept with Py∣late, and therfore he went the more boldly to Pylate: where as a poore mean man durst nat be so bolde. And therfore we may say that it was done of the prouision of god that Ioseph shuld haue that riches and noblenes wherby he myght the more honorably burye the body of our sauiour Iesu. &c. Of this we spake in the .lxiiii. artycle. ¶The .x. Myracle. THe .x. Myracle or meruell was the watche & keapyng of the sepulcre, for ye Iues desyred of Pylate, that they myght haue sawgiours to watch and keape the sepul∣cre, which was a rare and a meruelouse thyng, that he which was put to so vile and shamefull death: shuld be keapt and watched. And note, that I do nat take a Myracle here properly and in his most propre significacion: but largely, as euery rare and vn wonte thyng yt is meruelouse may be called so a myracle.
And of this maruell, we spake sufficiently in the .lxv. article, of the second parte. Of other myracles that ware shewed that tyme: ye shal se hereafter in the treates of Bernardyne of the .xii. meru∣louse frutes of the tree of life, and of the wonderouse misteries of the most holye crosse. Also ye haue lyke myracles in the fyrst parte of this boke in the fyrst chapiter of the .v. particle. &c. ¶Why Christ wold suffre so many and such greiuouse paynes for vs. Capi. ii. HEre sum doctours assygne diuerse reasons / as it ware by a manere of recapitulation, or rehersynge of suche thynges as haue ben spoken byfore of the passion of our lord, sayng that Christ suffred so many, and so greuouse paynes for vs: for that, that he wold by euery one of them / take from vs som euyll, and gyue to vs som good thyng. Which thyng is to be diligently attendyd / and strongly & also continually to be infixed and prynted in our hert. We deseruyd by our synnes: eternall he∣uines, agaynst the which our lord Iesu in the begynnyng of his passion after his last supper did wyllyngly take so great heauines that he his selfe sayd vnto his disciples.Math. 26. D. Tristis est anima mea vs{que} ad mortem. My soule is heuy vnto the death. And this heuines he toke vpon hym, that by it which he suffred īnocently: he myght take frome vs that euerlastyng heuines which we had deseruyd for our synnes, and also that he myght gyue to vs / eternal ioy and gladnes. Also we by our synnes deseruyd to be perpetually sub∣dued vnder ye power and thraldom of the dyuell and so to be com∣mitted to the eternall prison of hell. But our lorde in his blessyd passion suffred hym selfe to be taken prisonar, that he by his suf∣feryng innocently that captiuitie: myght therby delyuer vs from the power and captiuitie of the dyuell and also preserue vs from that most darke prison of hell, and restore vs vnto the libertie of the childerne of god. Moreouer we by our synnes deseruyd to be perpetually associate and accōpanyed with the dyuels and other dampned soulys. Agaynst this our sauiour Iesu wold be associat with theuys and wold be accompted as one of thē: that he myght bye vs from the cumpaygnie of dampned soulys and from the feloweshyp of dyuels, and so to make vs the chyldern of god and felowes of aūgells. He to whom al the glorie of heuyn doth serue and which only of hym selfe is all beautie and glorie wold suffre shamys rebukes and mockynges: that he myght redeme vs from
confusion and etarnall derision of dyuels and theyr rebukes, and also that he myght reuoke and bryng vs agayne to the glorie of heuyn which we lost by our synne. He that onely hath power to louce and bynde, of his great mercy wold be bounde for vs: that he myght louce vs from the bondes of our synnes, and from al the paynes yt we deseruyd by our synnes. And at last he suffred death innocently: that by his death he myght destroy our eternall death and also gyue to vs eternall lyfe in glory. And thus ye may vnder stonde of all other paynes of Christe. For vniuersally to speake ther was no thyng vayne, no thyng vnprofitable ī al his passion, but euery payne that he suffred, was ordenyd to take away from vs sum perpetuall euyll that we had deseruyd by our synnes, and to merite and gyue to vs sum eternal goodnes that we had lost by our synne. And therfore saynt Austen sayth, Christ suffreth to my profit / he is heuy for me, he soroweth to my cōforth. And the cause of these is this, for he hath louyd vs eternally, and hath desired to be louyd of vs agayne, for loue can nat be recompensyd but by loue.Su{per}. Cāti. Serm̄. xi. And hereunto also saynt Bernard sayth. Myght nat our creatoure and maker repare his creature agayne or redeme hym without that gret difficulty & hard paynes of his passion? Yes he myght haue done it without payne, if it had so pleased hym. But he wold rather do it with his great iniurie and payne: to wyn the loue of man and to gyue hym many and great causes of loue. For this great difficultie and greuouse paynes that he suffred for our redemption shuld moue that person to gyue hym thankes, which lityll regardyd the werke of his creasion, bicause it was done so easly. What (thynke you) sayd the vnkynd man, of his creacion? I was create and made lyghtly and frely, without any payne or la∣bour of my creatour and maker, he onely spake the worde: and I was creat, as al other thynges ware. So the wicked vnkyndnes of man lytyll regardyng the werke of his creasion: shewed there matter of vnkyndnes: where he shulde haue taken cause of loue. But now the mouth of those wicked men be stopped. For now it is more clere than the lyght, what payne and labour thy lord god had (o vnkynd man) for thy redempcion. Of a lorde: he becam a seruant, where he was riche: he was made poore / he beyng god: toke vpon hym a mortall body, and the son of god: despised nat / for the to be made ye son of man. Remembre therfore (thou vnkynd man) though thou were made of nought: yet thou wart nat rede∣myd of nought. In .vi. dayes god made all the worlde, and the (o thou man) amonges them all. But .xxxiii. yere he labored con∣tinually
with great paynes to werke thy health and saluacion. What laboure had he in soueryng the incommodities of our na∣ture / as hunger, thyrst / heat / colde / and suche other. What tempta∣cions of the deuyll / what slaunders / rebukes / despisynges, moc∣kynges, beatynges with many greuouse paynes, and at last most paynefull and shamefull death. Therfore thou man be no more vnkynd, but loue and thanke god, and haue compassion of thy creatoure / redemar and sauiour. Amen. ¶How Christe descendyd vnto the helles. The thyrd Chapitre. AFter that our sauiour Iesus had gyuen vp his spirit, and so was deed: furthwith his soule vnit and knyt or ioyned vnto the godhed: descendyd vnto the helles, vn¦to the holy fathers that were there in prison and there stode with them. Of this descension: Damascen sayth thus.Libro. iii. The soule of Christe ioyned to his godhed: descendyd vnto the helles,Ca. xxix. that as he had bifore, comforted them that were in the world aboue the erth: so he myght shyne and comforte them that sat in darknes and in the shadowe of death. He descendyd to com∣forte the holy faythers / to glad them and to glorifie them. For as shortly as he presentyd hym selfe to them: they dyd se his godhed / and so then they ware in paradise, that is, they had the clere syght of the godhed: which is ioy and lyfe eternall. Of this descension also saynt Austen in a certen sermon sayth thus.Sermone. C. xxxvii. de t{per}e. C. Anon as Christe had gyuen vp his spirit: his soule knyt to his godhed: discendyd to ye deapnes of helles. And whan he was cum to yt place of derke∣nes, as a victoriouse captayne shynyng and terrible: tho wicked hell houndes and legions of derknes, beholdyng hym: begane to enquire and say. From whens cam this person, so strong, so ter∣rible, so shinyng and gloriouse? That worlde which hath bene euer subdued to vs: dyd neuer sende to vs such a deed person. He neuer sent to vs suche gestes before this tyme. What is he, that so boldly entreth in to our iurisdiction? And nat onely he doth nat fear our tormentes: but moreouer he dothe louce other frome our bondes. Beholde and see howe they whiche ware wonte to weape and more ouer vnder oure tormentes: nowe they rebuke vs and vpbrayde vs of theyr deliueraunce and sal∣uacion. And nat onely, they in nothynge feare vs: but more∣ouer they threten vs. There was neuer deed men so proud & stub∣bourne
borne agayst vs as these be. Nor neuer myght any persones in captiuitie: be so glad and ioyfull as these be. O thou Lucifer our captayne, why wold yu bryng this person vnto our place? All thy myrth is paste, all thy ioy is turned in to weapyng and sorowe. Whan thou dyd hang Christe vpon the crosse: thou knewest nat what dammage thou prepared for thy selfe in hel. After these com¦playnyng voyces of these most cruell tormentoures of hell: there was a greate multitude of sayntes weapynge for ioy that sayde. Welcome our redemer, welcome our sauyour, whom we daylye and of long tyme with great desire haue loked for and taried thy cummyng. Thou haste now descendyd vnto helles for vs, forsake vs nat whā thou shalt returne agayne to heuyns. O deuote soule. Consider here howe tho holie fathers dyd ioy in the cummyng of Christ, how they ware replenished with great gladnes, al sorow and displeasure vtterly excludyd.Psal. C. xvii. And so they stode in songes and praysyng{is} byfore god sayng. Blessyd be he that is com in ye name of god, our lord god hath shyned to vs. Thou art our god / our sa∣uiour,Psal. C. vi. thou hast dryuen away al derknes from vs, and thou hast loused our bondes yu hast broken ye brason gates & the iren barres thou ī thy great strenght deliuers ye bond prisoners, and yu leades thy electe people frō prison, wt great ioy. Therfore now we laude and worship the for euermore, and so they fell al prostrate & wor∣shypped him.Psal. 77. Than answeryng to them / our lord Iesu sayd. Aten dite popule meus legem meam. O my people attende my lawe. Peace be to you and eternall ioy. I am your lord god yt brought you out of Egipte. And many other thynges we may suppose that Christe spake to them, of the which the gospell maketh no mencion. Also he said, take hede and se, for I am your god, which hath create redemyd and sauyd you.Psal. xxxix. It is written of me in the hede or begynnynge of the boke: that I shulde do the wyll and pleasure of my father.Psal. 97. And for your health I haue descendyd. I haue ben poore and in greate laboures from my yong age enten∣dyng to the saluacion of your soules. They that shulde haue ben my chylderne:Psal. xvii. ware made straungers to me, and haue made false lies vpon me.Psal. 37. My frendes and negboures thought euyll agaynst me.Psal. xxi. All that saw me: dyd mocke me. I was scourged all the day,Psal. lxxii. and my betyng was in the mornyng.Psal. xxi. They haue diggyd my handes and my feet,Psal. 68. and they haue nombred all my bonys. They put gall in to my meate,Psal. iii. & they gaue me vinegre to drynke. I haue sleapte and slumberyd or dyed vpon the crosse and my
bodye reasteth in hope of my restrreccion,It. lxxxvii. and so furth of diuers other thynges which the prophetes wrote vpon hym.Psal. lxxi. As saynt Bonauenture sayth In his meditacions of the lyfe of Christ. And then al the holy soules answeryd, blessed be ye name of thy maiesty for euermore and all the erth myght be replenyshed with thy ma∣iestie and glorie.Psal. lxxxix Amen Amen.Psal. x C. 3. For thou art made to vs a refuge and a comforter for euermore. If thou had nat healpyd vs: our soules shuld haue abiden in hell eternally.1. Pet. 1. C. But thou our lord god hast remembred vs and hast redemyd vs with thy preciouse blode thou hast shewyd vnto vs thy face which the aungelles in heuyn desire to beholde.Psal. lxv. All the world myght worshyp the our lord god and prayse thy holie name now and euer Amen. In such laudes / praysynges / songes and ioyenges: stode the holy soules in limbo patrum nygh vnto the tyme of Christes resurrection, and there was also with them a great cumpaigney of aūgelles ioyeng and praysyng god with them. And after this our lord toke those holy soules frō hel wt great ioy, and wt great glory goyng byfore them: brought them and put them in Paradise of pleasures. And there a lytyll while abydyng with them and with Enoch and Hely / which ther knowyng hym: dyd worshyppe hym and prayse hym. And then our sauiour sayd to them. It is time that I go and reyse my bodie. I will go and take it agayne. And all the holy fathers fallyng doune prostrate: sayd, go ye our lord and gloriouse kyng and retourne shortly agayne if it shal so please you, for we gretly desire to se your gloriouse bodye. A prayer. O Good Iesu, thy vnspekable pitie and charitie was nat yet saciate and content with thy death, but that thou wold visite the clausures of hell and redeme thy people there beyng in captiuite, therfore thy moste blessyd and gloriouse soule knyt to thy godhed, de∣scendyd vnto the helles delyueryng thy elect people from ye derk∣nes and shadowe of death: I beseach the O merciful Iesu that thy grace and mercy myght descende vpon the soules of our parentes bretherne / sisterne and all our kynsfolkes / also vpon the soulys of our familiar aquayntance / benefactoures and al other that we be bounde to pray for and of al christen soulys, that thou wold dely∣uer them from ye paynes that they haue deseruyd for theyr synnes, and that thou wold bryng them to eternall glorie. Amen.
¶Of the resurrection of our Lorde. The .iiii. Chaptre. OUr Lord cummyng with an honorable multitude of aūgelles very early on the Sonday in the mornyng and reysyng his moste holy bodye from his sepulcre: dyd cum furth of the same by his owne power & ver∣tue it beyng closse or shut & sealid as the Iues left it. And hereof saynt Austen sayth. Our sauiour Iesus after his bea∣tynges and scornynges after the drynke of vinegre and gall, after the paynes of the crosse and his woundes, and at laste after his death and descendyng to hell: in a new fleshe and body but yet the same: he arose from death / the secreat and hyd lyfe, and health re∣seruyd in death: dyd rise and cum agayne more beautiouse and gloriouse after his death.Psal. C. iii. Then was the age of Christe renuyd:Gene. 49. B. as is in the Egle. Then the Lion dyd reyse his whelp. Then the byrd called Fenix dyd lyue agayne.Hebre. 18. A. Then the potter after that his pottes ware broken, of the same erth: made a newe pot, after his owne pleasure.Ione. 2. D. Then Ionas cam out of the Whallys belye with out hurte.Zach. 4. A. Then was the candelstike coueryd with golde. Then: (that is at this resurrection) the tabernacle of Dauid that was fallen:Amos. 9. C was reysed vp agayne. Then the son shone, Which byfore was in a cloude.Ioh. 12. D. Then was the whete grayne or corne quickned: which cast in to the erth was deed.Iudicū. 16. A. Then the Hart toke his hornes agayn. Then Sampson toke the gates of the citie and went vn∣to the hyll.Gene. 41. C. Then Ioseph brought out of prison: was ordeyned and made the lorde of al Egipt. Then the sacke that is the body of Christ cut and rent in his passion:Psal. xxix. was now clad with glorie and ioy. Wherfore this paschal solempnite is very greate and so∣lempne.Rōs. 6. B. In the which Christ arisyng from death / dothe nat now die, or is nat now deed and death hereafter shall neuer haue domi¦nion or power ouer hym. For god his father hath clothed hym with the stole of īmortalytie and glory. And in this solempnitie: we haue example of our resurrection, the hope and trust of the heuenly cuntre is offred to vs, the clausures of hell ben destroyd, and the gates of heuyn be openyd to vs. Therfore this is the day that our lorde hath made.Psal. C. xvii. Ioy we and be glad therin. For this day Christ hath taken away the burnyng swearde, and openyd the gates of paradyse, which no man myght cum before, vnto that Christ cam thyther with the holy thefe / sayng to ye aūgelles. Open ye to me the gates of iustyce and I entred in to them,Psal. C. xvii. shall prayse god. This is the day in the which the sinagoge is deed or endid / and the church borne or begun. This is the day in ye which
we syng Alleluya that is, we laude and prayse god. Prayse we therfore (frendes) our lord god in our lyfe and in our speach with herte and mouth, with our voyces and good maners for so will our lord god haue Alleluya (that is his praysynges) song to hym, that there be no discorde in the prayse / that his lite and wordes a∣grey in one. O blessyd Alleluya, or praysyng{is} of god that is song in heuyn, where as is the temple of god, and legions of aūgelies. There is the most hyghe concorde of the praysers. There is no repugnaunce in the membres agaynst the spirit. There is no stry¦uyng for couetise / wherby shuld perish ye victorie of charitie. Let vs here syng Alleluya diligently: that there we myght syng it su∣rely here in hope: ther in the very presence of god / here in the way there in our heuenly contre / let vs here syng, nat for that we haue the delectacion of quietnes: but for the solace of our labour / as we se that men goyng or rydyng by the way, be wonte to syng, to comforte theyr labour, to quicken them in theyr iorney and to go forward merely. And herunto saint Bede sayth. O my soule arise with Christe from thy filthy sepulcre or custom of syn. Areise vp thy hert vnto the hope and trust of thy resurreccion and eternall lefe. Let vs now dye from syn in this present life for ye loue of god that after our resurrection we may lyue in the life to com, for if we mortifie our body nowe for the loue of Christe: then we shall reygne with him in euerlastyng ioy. Let vs so enforce ourselfe to be present and to honoure god in these feastes in the cumpaigney of mortall men: that we may deserue to be present at the eternall feastes with aūgelles. For what shuld it profite vs to keape these feastes temporally, if we be excludyd from those eternal feastes? For these present solemnities ben but a shadowe: of the feastes to cum / therfore we keape these feastes reuerently and yerely: that we myght cum to those feastes that be continuall. When any feast is here keapt at his day assigned: our mynd shuld be referryd and occupied with the desire of that same feast that is in heuen conti∣nually & eternall. Therfore our hertes thorow the frequentacion and vse of spiritual ioy in these temporall feast{is}: shuld be kyndled and wax feruent to the desire of eternal ioyes, and so we shuld vse our meditacions here in the shadow of ioy: that in very truth we may here after haue the fruicion of the true and euerlastyng ioy. Amen All this is taken of saynt Gregory.Omel. 2 9. A prayer.
O Lord Iesu Christe our eterne and onely swetnes, which breakyng the bondes of death hath glorified thy bodye / and hath risen from deathe in glorie vnspekable: I pray the and I beseach the for thy gloriouse and florishyng re∣surrection to graunt to me, that I risyng from vices and ye death of soule may euer florishe in vertues and so walke in the newnes of good lyfe that I may sauer and folowe those thynges that be aboue and heuenly, and nat tho thynges that be erthly and transi¦torie. Also good lord by the vertue of thy clernes: purge my soule from the derknes of syn, that by the same vertue at the day of ge∣nerall resurrection my bodye may arise vnto glory, that I may ioy both in soule and body, eternally with the in thy glory. Amen. ¶Now Christ apperyd to his mother Mary the .v. Chapitre. THe same houre that Christe rose, the thre Maries, that is. Mary Magdalene. Mary Iocobe, and Mary Salome desirynge licence of our Ladie: of great deuocion and loue they had to our sauioure Christ, began to go with swete oyntmentes vnto the sepulcre of Christ to anoynt his bodye. And our Lady remayned at home, continuyng in weapyng and prayers. And very conue∣niently, these thre women ware called by one name, for they ware of one wyll and mynde, and lyke desire towardes Christe. There be thre states of men that shalbe sauyd, and iche one of these dothe seke Christe, and without these thre states there is no man sauyd / that is, begynners, profiters, and perfite persones, or elles, pe∣nitentes, actiue / and contemplatyue persones, which thre states be signified by the thre. Maries which sought our lord, and that we may take by thre interpritacions of this worde. Maria. The state of begynners or penitentes is noted by. Mary Magdalene, which was a famouse and knowen synner, and afterwarde very penitent. And thought somtyme by her, may be signified the con¦templatiue life,Luce. x. G. as in the .x. chapitre of Luke. Yet at this tyme she may signifie to vs the state of penitentes for the euangelist sayth of her,Math. 16. C. that Christ cast out .vii. deuylles, that is, al vices, frō her. And also in the gospell of Luke she is knowen to be the capteyn and example of all true penitentes.Luce. 7. F. And for this cause: she is con∣ueniently called Maria, that is, a better see / or elles after the He∣breus Maria, commyth of Mara, that is, interpreted bitter, And
hereunto the olde woman Ruth:Ruth. 1. D. sayde. Non vocetis me Noemy pulchramised vocate me Mara. &c. Call nat me fayre: but call me bitter, for our Lord hath fulfylled me with bitternes. And this was verefied in Mary Magdalen,Luce. 7. F. when byfore the feet of our Lorde: she washed with her teares the spottes of her synnes. So Petre beyng penitent:Math. xxvi. G. weapt bitterly. And so to euery penitent soule may be sayd the wordes of the prophet.Tren̄. 2. D. Magna velut mare contricio tua. O thou penitent soule, thy contricion is great and bitter as the see. The state of profiters or of actiue persons is sygnified in Mary Iacoby, that was the mother of Iames the selfe. Iacobus is asmoche to say by īterpretacion as a supplanter or a wrestlar, for it apperteyneth to actiue persons and profiters to supplante or to subdue vice, also to wrestle and laboure in the spirituall exercise of vertues. And herunto is also conuenient the second interpretacion of this name Maria, which after ye Sire tonge or speach: is called Domina. A lady. For sith these profiters and actiue persons be in continual datel, for the pronitie that they haue to vice, and the difficultie vnto all goodnes and vertue: ther¦fore it is necessary that these profiters haue the dominion or ladi¦shippe ouer theyr owne passions / and that: by reason, so that they gyue no place vnto temptacions. And through this stryfe or wrastlyng whan reason hath the dominion ouer sensualitie: ver∣tues be generate and gotten. The state of contemplatiue and perfite persons is signified by Mary Salome, which was the mother of Iames the more and of Iohan the euangelist.Math. xx. C. This woman asked of Christ his kyngdome for her sonnys. So perfite and contemplatiue {per}sons ar chefely occupied about the kyngdom of god, for they haue in them selfe the kyngdom of god and here do partely taste therof. And hereunto, Salome, is called by inter∣pretacion, peacefull. For there is no peace to man in this lyfe: but in contemplacion. And hereunto accordeth the thyrd interpreta∣cion of this name Maria, that is, illuminate / and therfore it may be sayd to euery contemplatiue person.Esaie. 60. A Surge illuminate Hierusa∣lem quia venit lumen tuum. Arise thou perfite soule and receyue lyght for thy lyght cummyth. And also iche one of these thre Ma∣ries had theyr oyntmentes, as ye may se in Ludolphe de Vita xi 2. parte.Ca. lxx. But if any person moue this question why our blessyd Ladie dyd nat go to visite Christes sepulcre: as the thre other Maries dyd? Herunto we may assigne thre causes. Fyrst, for the mother of Christe myght nat se the sepulcre of her son without great sor, and specially beyng so lately buried. Second cause,
for she had weapt so moche the Friday and Saterday before, and brought her selfe so lowe: that she myght nat susteyne and suffre that laboure. And hereunto sayth saynt Bernard. The blessyd virgyn Marie was so feble & weake: that she was brought home from the crosse: as halfe deed. Third cause, for ye forsayd women thought that the bodie of Christe was then liyng in his sepulcre, and therfore they wold haue anoynted (as of old custom haue ben vsed) his bodie, to preserue it frome corruption where as this gloriouse virgyn knewe that it shuld neuer corropte, and that he was risen from death to life immortall, or els shortly shuld rise. And therfore she went nat with them. But she sat in a secret place alone very feble and weake in all the powers of her bodie, for she had greatly tormentyd her selfe with great sorowe / watche and abstinence, from that tyme yt she hard say that her onely and dere belouyd son was taken and scourged, and afterwarde when she se hym crucified / smytyng and knockyng with her delicate handes vpon her tendre breste. And thus (I say) very feble sat alone in contemplacion and prayer and also weapyng for those misteries and paynes that her son had suffred. And as she was thus in pra∣yer and swete teares of deuotion: sodenly her son Iesus cam and apperyd to her in most white clothes of glorie and in the newnes of his resurrection, beautiouse and gloriouse, with a glad and louely chere comfortyng his desolate and heuy mother. And ther¦with she knelyng downe worshipped hym, and then risyng vp: with teares and vnspeakable ioy embraced hym and then all the bitternes of her sorowe was torned in to ioy and comforth. After this they both setyng to gether: our Ladie besily and curiously be held hym in his face handes and feet and in al his bodie, whither he had the printes and sygnes of his woundes / searchynge and askyng whether all his paynes and sorowe were clene paste and gon from hym. And he sayd, yea my worshipful mother all my so∣rowes and paynes be now past and gon, and shall neuer retorne agayne to me. O with how great ioy (thynke you) was then that blessyd Lady repleat? When she se and beheld her son immortall and impassible and nat onely that he shuld liue euermore: but al∣so that he had the perpetuall dominion ouer heuen and erth and all creatures in them. And so they louyngly and pleasantly com∣mynyg and talkyng to gether: made a great ioyfull pasch, or so∣lempne feast. And though of this fyrst aperyng vnto his mother there be nothyng written in the gospels: yet we do godly beleaue / that Iesus fyrst appered vnto his mother Mary. For so it was
conuenyent as doctours don say that he shuld so do, and that he shuld fyrste conforth and glad his mother by his resurrection, which louyd hym aboue all other persones. Also bycause she had more sorow of his death than any other had: it was seamyng and worthy that he shuld fyrst comforthe her. And the church of Rome dothe seame to approue this same for fyrste in the mornynge of Ester daye she maketh a solempne stacion at the churche of our Lady, called our Lady the more. Maria maior. Mary the more. Herby notyng that Christ dyd fyrst appere vnto his mother. And where the euangelist sayth,Mar. 16. C that Christe dyd fyrste appere vnto Mary Magdalen: is to be vnderstondyd of these apperynges / wherby he wold proue his resurrection. For he apperyd fyrst of al vnto his mother, nat for that he wolde therby proue his resurrec∣cion: but for to comforth and glad her with his presence, and do his dutie and honour her as his mother. A prayer. O Mary the mother of god, most graciouse virgyn & com∣fortar of al desolate persons callyng and criyng vnto the: I beseche the for that gret ioy wherby thou was cōforted, when thou knowest that thy son Iesus Christe was risen ye thyrd day from death vnto lyfe immortall & impassible: that thou wold be a comfortar of my soule, that what tyme I shall arise both in body and soule at the last day of iudgement and there appere be∣fore that same son of thyn Iesus Christ / and there to rendre myne accompte of al my thoughtes / wordes and deades: it wold please thy motherly pitie to healpe me / that by the (o blessyd mother and vigyn) I myght escape the sentence of eternall dampnacion: and graciously to cum to the euerlastynge ioy and glorie with all the electe and chosen people of god. Amen. ¶How Iesu apperyd to Mary Magdalen The syxte Chapitre. MAry Magdalen ful of bitternes & sorow, burning in loue and nat knowyng what she shuld do: for wtout her maister Christ: she myght nat lyue, and wher he was buried: she fonde hym nat and where to search for him she knew nat. Wherfore of great feruore & constancy: she stode as if she had ben amaised, for the vehemence of her loue: wold nother suffre her to
sit ne yet to lye, therfore she stode without in the garden byfore the holy sepulcre weapyng & lamentyng for her lorde. Her hert was so feruently kyndled in loue, she was moued with so great pytie / drawen with so myghty and strong bondes of charitie: that for∣gotten her owne infirmitie and frayltie: she was nat withdrawen and letted frome the visitynge of Christes sepulcre for the dar∣knes of the mournyng, nor yet for the crueltie of the Iues, but ra∣ther she abode there weapyng and searchyng for her lorde. She wold nat departe: thoughe the disciples went from thens, for she was so kindled in the fyre of loue, she was so burned with a feruēt desyre / she was so wounded with inpacient loue: yt nothyng was pleasant to her, but onely weapyng, So that she myght well saye the wordes of the prophete Dauid.Psal. 4. Fuerunt mihi lacrime mee pa∣nes die ac nocte. My teares ware to me my breade or meate, bothe by the nyght and the day / whan it was sayd to me dayly, where is thy god. She had lost her mayster whom she loued so syngulerly that besydes hym she could loue no body, nor trust to them. She was so drowned in his loue, he was so moche in her mynde: that in a maner she was insēsible to al other thyng{is}. Whyles she thus weapt for the absence of Christes body: she oftymes inclyned and bowed downe her body, lokyng in to the sepulcre, where as the bo¦dy was leyd, she had lost ye lyfe of her soule, & therfore she thought it better for her to dye: than to lyue, for she peraduenture deynge myght fynd hym:Omel. 25. whome she myght nat fynde lyuyng. And thus weapyng (I say) she loked oftymes into ye graue, for as saynt Gre¦gorie sayth. It is nat sufficient for a louer, to loke ones, for the fer¦uour of loue encreaseth the desyre of searchyng or lokyng. And at last whan she so loked: she dyd se with her bodely yen .ii. Angels sittyng in whyt garmēt{is}, which sayd to her, why dost thou weap? thou hast no cause to weape: but rather to ioye of Christes Resur¦rection, he is nat here, he is arysen. Than she supposyng that they ware men and nat Angels: sayd to them shewyng the cause of her weapyng, they haue takē away my lorde, and I knowe nat where they haue put hym,Ioh. 20. C. for she se the stone takē away / and therfore she thought that somme other body had stollen the body of Christ and borne it to somme other place. And whan Mary Mag∣dalen dyd thus contynue in her sorowe and weapynge and no¦thynge regardynge the Angels: her mooste louynge mayster Christe: coulde absente hym selfe no lengar from her.
Than she turned her selfe about: that she myght se Iesus, for by∣fore that, her backe was towarde hym, and that was to signifie ye doutfulnes of her soule, for she belyued nat that he was rysen from death vnto lyfe, & therfore her backe was towarde the face of our lorde. But yet for asmoche as she loued hym / thoughe she douted of his Resurrection: therfore she dyd se hym: and dyd nat knowe hym. She se hym: but nat in his glorious forme or body: for as yet she dyd nat belyue that he was rysen, And so he appered to her after that maner in his body: as he was in her mynde and soule, And than Iesus sayd to her,Ioh. 20. D. Mulier quid ploras, quem queris? wo¦man why weapest thou? whome dost thou seach? he doth nat aske this of any ignorance: but yt hearyng her answer: he myght more conueniently instructe her in the fayth. And as saynt Gregory sayth,Omel. 25. He asked the cause of her sorowe: to kyndle and augment or encrease her loue and desyre, that whā she shuld name hym whom she loued: her loue shuld be more feruēt towardes hym. And note here that Iesus appered to her in the likenes of a gardiner, & that very conueniently, For he was to her a spiritual gardyner, for he labored to plucke out the thornes and weades of infidelite and vi¦ces: and to sow and plante in the garden of her soule, the grene sea¦des of fayth and vertue, by the vertue of his feruent loue. Suche office / suche operation / suche exercise: and suche interpretacion of her name: is conuenient for begynners or penitentes. For it is cō¦uenient that a penitent vse hym selfe as a gardyner / that is, that he pull out by the rootes al vices / and plante in his soule: vertues and also that he haue contricion accordyng to the fyrst interpreta¦cion of this name Maria, As we shewed in the chapitre next by∣fore this.Ioh. 20. D. And than this blyssed woman (as in a maner dronke in loue) answered to Iesus: as to a gardyner, Domine si tu sustulisti eum, dicito mihi ʐc. Syr / if thou hast takē hym away: tell me wher he is: that I may go and take hym? A meruelous boldnes of this womā, for she was nat afrayd of ye syght of a deed body / and wold also attempte to beare a deed cors: the which far passed her power But she thought that she could do it, for there is nothyng to hard to a louyng soule. And than our lorde Iesus hauyng cōpassion of her great sorowe / and willyng no lenger to suffre her to weape called her by her proper name. Bifore that he called her by a cōmē name / sayng, mulier, womā, & thā she knewe hī nat, but now whā he said Maria: furthwith she was turned both hert & soule / as she was byfore turned ī body / & as a good shepe: knew ye voice of her
and so she reuyued?Ibidem. sayd to hym with vnspekable ioy, O Raboni: O mayster (for so she was wont to call hym byfore his passion) yu art he whome I saught / and anon she ranne to hym, and fallynge downe to his feet, with great loue and deuocion wold haue em∣brased them and kyssed them as she was wont to do byfore / by an vnperfyte affection to his manhode, but our lorde as a spirituall gardyner willyng to plante true fayth in her hert / and to lyft vp her soule to his godhed and heuenly thynges:Ibidem. sayd to her. Noli me tangere, touche nat me in that erthly maner with thy bodely han∣des: whome as yet thou hast nat touched with true fayth of hert. And so he enstructe her in the true fayth of his godhed and resur∣rection. Let vs now lerne of this Mary to loue Iesus, to trust in hym / to seache hym without ceasyng, to feare none aduersities, to receyue no consolacion or cōforth but in Iesus, to despise al thyn¦ges but Iesus. A prayer. O Moste swete mayster, o moste swete Iesu, howe good art thou to them that be clene in hert, howe swete art yu to them that loue the. O howe happy ar they that seache the and fynde the, howe blyssed ar they that trust in the, It is truth, that thou louyst all them that loue the, thou neuer forsakest them that trust in the / lo lord, this Mary thy true louer of a good siple mynd she saught the, and truly she foūd the, she was not forsaken of the, but she had more of the: than she looked for. I beseach the lorde, graunt me to loue the, to seache the and to trust in the, yt I may deserue to fynde the and to be loued of the, and neuer to be forsaken of the. Amen. ¶Howe Iesus appered to his disciples: Thomas beyng also present. The .vii. Chapitre. THe .viii.Ioh. 20. G. day of his Resurection / our lorde Iesus appe¦red to his disciples / Thomas beyng presēt with them, For the fyrst day of his Resurrection he appered to his disciples,E. what tyme Thomas was there absent,F. And whan Thomas was comme to theyr compaigney: the disciples sayd to hym, Vidimus dominum, we haue sene our lorde and oure mayster, and than Thomas sayd, excepte I see the sygnes or the
pryntes of the nayles in his handes and put my fynger in the ho∣les,Ciillus and also put my hande into his syde: I wyl nat belyue. These wordes ware nat spoken of any malyce:Ioh. lib. 12. but rather of ignorance, and of a great sorowe & heuynes for that he had nat sene our lorde and therfore his louyng and godly maister Iesus wold nat leaue his louyng discyple in that blyndnes and heuynes:Ca. 57. but for to com¦forth hym and for to reforme his fayth: it pleased hym to appere a∣gayne.Bonauen. in medita. vite x. Therfore whan his discyples ware gadred to gyther in ye mount of Syon, where as he kept his maūdy or supper / and also Thomas beyng with them:Cap. 74. et. 105. the good shepherd and herdman Ie∣sus / diligent to comforth his lytell small flock: cam vnto them the gates / dores / and wyndowes beyng shyt / and so stode in the myd∣dest of them, that he myght be sene of them all, and sayd to them. Pax vobis.Ioh. 20. G. Peace be to you. And note here that there can neuer be peace in a comynalty: except the prelate be in the myddest, so that he be nat enclyned more to one part: than to the other. A pillar can neuer susteyne and bear vp the house, if it be set nygh to ye wal and nat in the myddest, and therfore the erth which is set in ye myd¦dest of the world: is vnmoueable, to signifie that euery prelate or herde shulde nat be moued by any parcialite more to one persone than to an other. Our lorde Iesus dyd oftymes shewe peace vnto his disciples / dyd also cōmend it and perswade them to haue it, for without peace:Psal. 77. we can nat haue god, the prophete to witnes whā he sayth. In pace factus est locus eius. His place and abydyng is in peace,Io. 20. G. Than Iesus said to Thomas. Infer digitum tuū huc et vide manus meas. Put in thy fynger here & se my hādes, & put forth thy hande and thurst it in to my syde, and be nat vnfaythfull, but be∣lyue. Than Thomas toyched the signes of Christes woūdes, & so byleued, nat onely with his hert: but also confessed it with his mouthe and sayd.Ibidem. Dominus meus et deus meus. Thou art my lorde after thy humanite / for thou hast redemed me with thy preciouse blode, & thou art my god in thy diuinite, for thou hast create me, I doute in nothynge nowe,Ibidem. but I am sure that thou art rysen from death to lyfe. Than Iesus said to hym, Quia vidisti me Thoma cre didisti, beati qui non viderunt et crediderunt. Thomas thou dost belyue bycause thou hast sene me, blyssed be they that belyue and haue not sene. In these wordes, is not only affirmed the fayth of Thomas: but also our fayth is moche commended and blessed, and the errour of the heretikes confounded: which sayd yt Christ had no true body. And here se the goodnes and mercy of oure
lorde / howe that he wolde appere and shewe hym selfe with his woundes: to saue one soule. Also note here, that the infinite wys∣dome and goodnes of god suffred Thomas to doute: that the re∣surrection of Christ shuld be prouyd by euident and manyfest ar∣gumēt{is} or signes, therfore Thomas douted: yt we shuld not dout. Herunto sayth saynt Gregory.Omel. 26. āte mediū. It was not of chaunce: but of the ordynaūce of god that ye welbeloued disciple of Christ, Thomas was absent whan Christ dyd fyrst appere, that he hearyng of his resurrection: shulde dowte, he so dowtyng: shuld feale and touche the places of the woundes of Christ, and so fealyng shuld beleaue, and that: to expell al dowtfulnes from our hertes. And so in fea∣lynge or puttynge in his hande into the syde of Christe: he cured in vs the woundes of our infidelite. Also the incredulite or dout∣fulnes of Thomas dyd more profyt vs vnto oure faythe: that the prompte and redy beleaue of the other disciples, for by his dow∣tyng and fealyng: our mynd is stablyshed in fayth / all dowtes set a parte. Mary Magdalen dyd lesse profyt to me by her swyft & redy fayth: than Thomas by his longe dowtyng, for he touched the pryntes of his woundes: and vtterly expelled from my soule the wounde of doutfulnes. Our lorde of his great goodnes reser¦ued the pryntes or signes of his woundes in his body after his re¦surrection, Not for that he could not cure thē: for he yt destroyed the power of death: myght also haue cured & put away those sig∣nes of death if it had pleased hym, but he wold reserue them for dy¦uers causes. Fyrst to confirme our fayth, as ye se in Thomas, Secondly, for to shewe to his father: whan he wyl pray for vs. And thyrdly to shewe them at the day of dome to the dāpned peo∣ple to theyr confusion. And these tokens of his woundes ware in no thynge to the deformitie of his glorious body: but rather as Crisostom sayth: to his great beautie, for they shone more bryght than the sonne.Libro. 22. de Ciuitate dei. Ca. 20. And as saynt Austen sayth, the tokens of the woū¦des that holy sayntes haue suffred here for Christe: shall in heuen appere in theyr bodyes not to theyr deformite: but to theyr glory as a starre in the firmament, as a presiouse stone in a rynge, as a flowre in the medowe, ond as the red colour in a rose, which be to the fairnes and beauty of these thynges, and so be tho pryntes of theyr woundes in theyr bodyes to theyr glory and dignitie. O thou louyng soule, behold now thy lorde and consydre his wonte goodnes, meaknes and feruent loue, howe he sheweth his woun∣des to Thomas and to his other disciples: to put away all blynd∣nes & ignoraūce frō theyr soules, for theyr profyt and oures also.
Our lorde stode there with them a lytel whyle: speakyng comfor∣table wordes of ye kyngdom of glory. And his disciples stode with hym ī great gladnes hearyng his godly wordes, & beholdyng his face full of fauour, beauty and glory. Beholde them howe they stande about hym, And stande thou reuerētly with ioy beholdyng them a far of: if paraduenture our lord moued of pytie and mercy wyl cause the to be called, thoughe thou of thy selfe be not worthy that compaygny. At last Iesus sayd vnto them, that they shuld goo into Galile and there he wold appere vnto them accordyng vnto his promisse. And so he blessed them and departed frō them, And they remayned in great comforth, but yet moche desyrous to se hym agayne. A prayer. O Lorde Iesu Christe which shewed vnto Thomas yt douted of thy resurrection, the places of the nayles and the spear, & hathe reuoked hym from errour by the puttynge in of his fynger into the holes of thy hādes, and of his hande into thy syde / graūt to me that I hauyng euer the remembraunce of thy woundes and passion, may expēd and put in my fynger and hand, that is, what so euer good werk or discreacion be in me I may put it in and ex∣pende it all holl in thy seruice to thy honour, And that I may con¦fesse with Thomas, that thou art my lorde, whiche hath bought me with thy preciouse blode, and my god, which hath creat & made me, And that whiche thou sayd byfore of our fayth, that blyssed be they whiche haue not sene and yet beleaue: I may haue experiēce therof in my selfe, and that by thy grace: I may be founde blyssed in thy syght. Amen. ¶Of the Ascencion of our lorde. The .viii. Chapitre. OVr lorde Iesus knowyng that the tyme was come,Ioh. 13. A. that he shulde departe from this worlde vnto his fa¦ther: he wold shewe, that not onely he loued his cho¦sen people in this lyfe, or whan he was mortall: but also yt he loued them vnto the ende, or for euer more and therfore he said to them,Ioh. 14. A. Vado parare vobis locum, I go to pre¦pare a place for you in heuyn, yet byfore that he went: he wold cō∣fort them, and take his leaue of them, And therfore he appered to
them in the mownt of Syon in that place where as he made his supper byfore his passion, for as they ware sittyng and eatyng in that place with our blyssed lady and other frendes of our lorde: he appered to them and dyd eate with them byfore his Ascencion as wel for a signe or tokē of his special loue to his disciples / as to {pro}∣ue his resurrection. And after yt they had eaten: he brought them all forth, not with hande: but with his worde and byddyng, and so they went from Hierusalem vnto Bethany, and than he had them go vnto the mownt of Oliuete, & there they shuld se hym ascende, and so he departed and vanished frō theyr syght. And at ye mownt of Oliuete he appered to them agayne.Actu. 1. A. And than some of his dis∣ciples sayd to hym, Domine si in tempore hoc restitues regnum Is∣rael. Shalt thou lorde restore at this tyme the kyngdome of Is∣rael, that is, wyll thou now delyuer the Iues from the subiection of the Romays. &c. our lorde answered, It ap{per}teyneth not to you to knowe tho secreat tymes or thinges, that my father hath in his onely power.Bonauen. And so after that Christ had spoken certen thynges to theyr instruction and also comforthe:In medita∣tionib{us} vite Christi. he kyssed ych one of them (for as saynt Ambrose sayeth, he left to them ye token of peace, that is he kyssed them),Ca. C. v. and so byddyng them fare wel: he lyfted vp his handes, to offre them all to his father, and blyssed them, gyuynge them grace and strenght to defend them from theyr enemyes, and also to werk good and godly werkes, and so he ascēded, And thā his mother and his disciples seyng hym eleuate and lyfted vp in to heuen: fell downe prostrate and worshypped hym, And for his departyng: they could not refrayne them selfe from weapyng, and yet they had great ioy and comforth: in that they se hym so glori∣ously ascende. And than there came and met hym all the ordres of Angels reuerently and in ordre, by dyuers compaygnyes and or∣dres, there was not one: but that he cam and dyd his deutye to his lorde god, And inclynyng to hym with all reuerence: they wayted vpon hym with Hympnes and songes of ioy vnspeakable. For as the prophete Dauid sayth,Psal. 46. Ascendlt deus in iubilo, Christ god and man ascended in great songes of ioy, which is to be referred not onely to the great ioy of the Angels: but also to the ioy of the holy soules redeamed by the passion of Christ and ascēdyng with hym, with a wonderfull ioye. It folowed in the psalme. Et do minus in voce tube, And our lord ascēded in the voyce of the trūpe, And this is to be referred to the sowne and voyce of the prechyng of the apostles, whiche preachyng was than enioyned and com∣maundyd to them,Math. 19. D. our lorde sayng to them. Euntes in mundū vni∣uersum
predicate euangelium omni creature. Go ye through out all the world: and preache my gospell to euery nacion. Whan thus both the angelles and blessed soules dyd syng: our lorde ioynyng his handes to gyther deuotely, and lyftyng them vp streyght by∣fore his brest: ascendyd with a cloude vnder his feet, And so al the blyssed soules reuerently ascendyd with hym. Nowe for asmoche as all the actes of our redempcion ware complete in the ascencion of Christ: therfore that day is worthely acompted as a hyghe and a great ioyfull day. For it is the moste solempne feast of our saui¦our Iesus, for that day he began to sit on the ryght hand of his fa∣ther, in his humanite, and so toke rest of all the labour and payne that he suffred in this worlde. It is also the propre feast of al bles∣sed spirites in heuyn, for than began theyr ruyne and decay to be repayred. It is also the feast of patriarches and prophetes and of all holy soules, for that day they fyrst entred into the kyngdome of glorie. It is morouer the feast of our lady, for asmoche as than she saw her sonne Iesus very god and man ascend vp vnto heuen with great glory in the same fleshe and body that he toke of her. Yet that day is properly our feast, for than our nature was fyrste exalted aboue the heuyns, and so man that byfore was lost: was that daye brought agayne by our sauiour Iesus vnto the kyng∣dome of heuyn and vnto the compaigney of angelles. Therfore let vs now ascende in hert and mynde: that whan tyme shall come that we be called from this worlde: we may ascende in soule, and after the generall resurrection: ascende both in soule and body. Christ dyd ascende and withdrawe from vs his corporall sence: to prouoke our affection and loue, and that we shulde desyre to be with hym with all our herte.Collo. 3. A. And therfore as the Apostle sayth, Quae sursum sunt queramus, quae sursum sunt sapiamus. Let vs serch and labour to knowe tho thynges that be in heuyn, and to tast or loue the same. Let vs flye all worldly and vayne desyres, let no thyng transytory please vs or content vs: whiche haue our father aboue in heuyn, And though we be here in body and also vse these temporal thyng{is} for the fraylty and infirmitie of our body: yet let vs go to god by our loue and desyre, as we reade of a certeyn de∣uote knyght, whiche with great deuocion went vnto Hierusalem to visite al the holy places where as our lorde suffred his passion or dyd ony notable thyng in his lyfe / and whan he had with fer∣uent deuocion visited all tho places: at last he cam vnto the moūt of Oliuete, vnto the place from whens our lorde ascended, where after that he had deuotely prayed: he sayd with teares. O good
lorde, I haue delygently saught the in many places here in erth, and where now to seache the: I knowe not, but in heuē, cōmaūde therfore swete Iesu my soule to departe fro my body: that I may fynde the in heuen where as thou syttes on the ryght hande of thy father in great glory, And with these wordes he yelded vp his spi¦rit without any sorowe. A prayer. O Iesu our crowne and glory, whiche rysyng from death dyd ascende vnto the ryght hande of thy father: drawe my soule vnto the: that I myght feruently seache and desyre ye onely, graūt to me I beseache the that I maye with all my desyre and studye come to that place: to the whiche as I stedfastly belyue thou hast ascended, And that I beyng here in body: may be with the in loue and desyre, that my hert may be there: where as thou art my loue and treasure moste to be louyd and desyred. Drawe me after the, that by thy grace I ascēdyng from vertue to vertue: may deserue to se the my lorde god in the heuenly Syon. Amen. ¶Of the sendyng of the holy ghost. The .ix. Chapitre. THe .L. day after ye Resurrection of Christ, and the .x. day after the Ascension, that is on wytsonday: whan the dis∣cyples of Christe were gadred to gether in the place of mount Syon where as he made his supper / both men & women to the nombre of .C.xx. or there about / there contynuyng in prayer, and abydyng the comyng of the holy ghost acordyng to promysse of Christ: about the thyrd houre of that same daye, there cam sodenly from heuen a wonderfull noyse or sounde as if it had bene the commynge of a great wynde,Ac. 2. A. and it fylled all the house, and there appered vnto them clouen tonges: or dyuyded / as they had ben fyre. And here note that the gyftes of the holy ghost be not gyuen, but to them: whiche be gadred to gyther by vnite or one assent in vertue, and lyfted vp by desyre vnto heuēly thynges. Also the .vii. gyftes of the holy ghost / be conueniently signified or shewed by fyre. Fyrst for the holy ghost doth purge lyke as fyre doth, and that is by the gyft of feare. Secondly, as the fyre doth melt: so doth the holy ghost by the gyft of pytie. Thyrdly, he beau¦tyfieth and maketh fayre by the gyfte of science or knowlege.
Fourthly, he strenghtheth by the gyft of strenght. Fyftly, he lyf∣teth vp the soule: by the gyft of councell. Syxtly, he doth illumy∣ne or lyghten the soule: by the gyft of vnderstandyng. And seuent¦ly, he doth make swete and pleasant by the gyfte of wysdom. And all that compaigny ware fylled with the holy ghost, and so began to speake dyuers speaches or langages, that is, whan they spake ony thyng to the glory of god: euery nacion {per}ceyued that speache as theyr owne speache / for so it sounded to them, and so they spake after the mocion of the holy ghost and as he gaue to thē vtteraūce whiche dyuydeth and gyueth his grace to euery person after his wyll and pleasure / where he wyl, whā he wyll, asmoche as it plea¦seth hym, by what maner he wyll, and to whome he wyll. Perad∣uenture thou wyll aske this question, Syth the ways and opera∣cions of god the holy ghost be vnserchable and can nat be percey∣ued: howe may I knowe that the holy ghost is in me? Surely I may greatly coniecture his presence in me: by the good mocions of my hert. Also I may aduerte and consydre the power of his ∣tue in me: by that I auoyde all carnall vyces, and subdewe al in∣ordinate affections, Also I may perceyue his wysdom in me: by the ofte discussion of my conscience, and rebukyng of my selfe for my synnes, Also I may suppose his goodnes and myldnes to rest in me: by the amendement of my maners and lyuyng. And also by the reformacion & renouation of my spirite: I may coniecture the same. Let euery man looke well in his owne hert, If he loue his neyghbour: it is a signe that the spirite of god is in hym. Also if he loue peace and vnite, and that in al the membres of Christes churche through out al the worlde,Ludolphus de vita xi {per}ce. 2. ca. lxxxiiii. And note here that these sig¦nes be taken dyuersly in dyuers degrees of persons. For the holy doth inspire, he doth enhabite, & doth replenishe or fulfyll, he doth inspire, or come to the begynners, he doth inhabite the profyters, and he doth fulfyll the perfyt {per}sons. The signes or tokens of the holy ghost, wherby he is perceyued to inspire the begynners ben iii. after saynt Bernard. Fyrst is contricion or sorowe for the syn¦nes paste, For the holy ghost hateth the fylth ye syn, and wyll not inhabite nor come to that {per}son that is subdewed to syn. Seconde signe is a firme and a sure purpose to beware and auoyde al synne here after, and this purpose is nat had without the grace of ye ho∣ly ghost assistyng and helyng our infirmite and frayltie. Thyrd signe is a diligent redines to do good. For the loue of god which is the holy ghost: is neuer ydle / but always redy to do good. There be also .iii. tokens wherby we may coniecture that the holy
ghost doth inhabite the profiters that goo forward in vertue. Fyrst is the deligent true and ofte examination of his conscience, nat onely of mortall synnes: but also of veniall synnes, for as the grace of the holy ghost is contrary to mortall synne: so is the fer∣uour of charite (whiche also cōmeth of the holy ghost) contrary to veniall syn, and expelleth it out of the soule, that in nothynge he shuld desplease the holy ghost, and hynder the soule from the {pro}fy∣tyng in vertue. The second to kē is the mynyshyng or subdewyng of the inordinate concupiscence, for the more that charite is encre¦sed in the soule of the {pro}fyter: the more is his soule remoued from the loue of temporall thynges. Thyrd signe is the diligent kea∣pyng of the cōmaundementes of god, which can nat be had with∣out true loue. There be also .iii. other signes, by the whiche we may coniecture that the holy ghost doth fulfyl the perfyte persōs. Fyrst is the manifestacion or shewyng of the godly truthe. For sytghe the holy ghost is the spirit of truth: it is his propertie to teache and shewe all truthe necessarie for man, and therfore wher he fulfylleth: there he sheweth all godly truthe necessarie for that soule. Second signe is, whan a person feareth nothyng but god, for perfyt charite putteth a way all seruile or worldly feare. And therfore saynt Paule sayth.1. Io. 4. D. Vbi spiritus domini: ibi libertas. where as is the spirite of god:2. Cor. 3. D. there is libertie, and no vayne feare. For liberty can nat stande with yt seruile feare. Thyrd signe is, whan a mā of the vehemēt loue that he hath to god desireth to be desol∣ued and departed from this myserable lyfe: and to be with Christ. Besyde all these tokens: there be other thre wherby a man may cō¦iecture yt he hath the holy ghost,Math. 3. D. &. 17. A. And for this cause the holy ghost appered in .iii. similitudes or lykenes.Itē. Orig. su{per} Math. Omel. 3. Fyrst in the lykenes of a douue, and that was at the baptisme of Christ. In the lykenes al so of a clowde: whan Christ was transfygured in the mounte. And in lyknes of fyre vpon the disciples on Wytsonday.Actu. 2. A. Fyrste signe (I say) wherby we may knowe or coniecture the presence of the holy ghost by his grace: is the aboūidaunce of teares, and that is noted by the apperyng of ye holy ghost in ye lykenes of a clowd. For as the south wynd blowyng the clowdes be resolued into ru∣yne: so by the cōmyng of the holy ghost our hertes relent into tea¦res. The seconde signe is the forgeuyng of iniuries or wronges done agaynst vs, and therfore the holy ghost appered in the lyke∣nes of a doue, that wanteth his gall. Thyrd signe is the desyre of heuenly thynges, and therfore the holy ghost appered in ye lyknes of fyre, whiche euer ascendeth vp ward, so the holy ghost makethe
our hertes assende vpwarde by desyre of heuenly thynges, which thynges if thou desyre: thou muste forsake and despye all vayne pleasures of the fleshe / or of the worlde. And herunto saynt Gre∣gory sayth, If we put awaye the pleasures of the fleshe: we shall shortly fynde that thyng whiche is pleasant to the spirite. Also spi¦rituall persons or carnall: may be knowen by the wordes of the Apostle sayng.Ro. 8. A. Qui secundum carnem sunt: que carnis sunt sapiunt. ʐc. they that be carnall: loue carnal pleasures / and spiritual {per}sons loue spirituall and heuenly desyres. But than specially a man is knowen to be spirituall: if he as sone / as shortly / and asmoch wyl auoyde that place and compaigney where he maye be hurted or hyndred in spirite: as he wyll do yt place where he may be hurted in body. Also if he as gladly wyll heare speake of spiritual thyn∣ges, as of the profytes of the body. Thyrdly if he be as diligent to procure for his soule: as the carnall man for his body. A prayer. O Iesu the gyuer of all gyftes whiche sent the holy ghost vn∣to thy disciples in the lykenes of fyre, I praye and beseache the O moste mercyfull lorde, that I (thoughe moste vnworthy) myght receyue to my perpetuall helth by thy grace, those gyftes whiche thy disciples receyued of thy onely beautiouse goodnes, and sende vpon vs (good lorde) thy seruantes ye spirite of thy cha¦rite / and loue and peace: whiche myght vysite and comforth our hertes▪ purge them from vyces, lyghten them with vertues, bynd vs in the bondes of peace and loue / illuminate vs with the lyght of thy knowlege, and inflame vs with the fyre of thy charite, for∣gyue vs our synnes, and bryng vs to lyfe euerlastyng. Amen. Of the Assumpcion and prayse of our glorious Lady. The .x. Chapitre. AFter the sendyng of the holy vpon the disciples: the blyssed virgyn the mother of Iesus, aslong as she ly¦ued: dyd remayne in the mount of Syon. O ye chri¦stians, I beseache you, if ye haue any pitie or com∣passion in you: consyder what sorowe she had, how she was cruciate with loue / how she burned ī great desyre: whā she remēbred, and reuolued in her mynde al such thyn¦ges as she had hard / seen / and knowē of her most swete son Iesus.
And nowe to speake of her assumpcion: this is the true and vn∣doutfull sentence. We beleaue, that she was assumpte and exal∣ted aboue all the ordres of aungels / though we were sumtyme ig∣norant, whether she was assumpte in soule onely: or els / both in body and soule. But the church nowe meakly and godly beleuith that she is assumpte both in soule and body. And as we beleaue aungels ware present to honoure her, both at her death / buriyng and also assumpcion, and all the court of heuyn dyd greatly ioy therof. For it is to be beleauyd yt all the court of heuyn with theyr cumpaigneys in ordre: cam gloriously to mete the mother of god and compassed her all about with a meruealouse lyght, and so brought her vp with great praysynges and spirituall longes vn∣to the trone, which was prepared and ordeyned for her byfore the creacion of the worlde. And no doute therof, all that blessyd cum∣paigney of heuenly Hierusalem then reioysed wt an vnspeakable gladnes, then was comforted with an in estimable charitie / and then ioyed with a meruealouse gratulacion and reioysyng, for that feast of this blessyd virgyns assumpcion, which is but ones in the yere celebrate with vs: is to them a continual feast and ioy. And nat without cause,In sermo. de Assūpti¦one Ma∣rie ad Paulum & Eustachi. for as saynt Hierom sayth, our lorde Iesu the sauiour of all, cam with great glory and met with his mother and with greate ioy to all the court of heuyn: dyd set her in a glo∣riouse trone nygh vnto hym selfe. O thou gloriouse Lady, what may I say more? Who so laboreth to considre and declare the in∣mensitie and hudghnes of thy grace and glory: his tonge faileth, his wit wanteth, and his reason can nat com therto. For as all sayntes in heuyn by thy glorification be inestimably beautified and gladded: so al creatures vpon erth be vnspeakably exalted by the same glorificacion. For as god by his power / creatynge and makyng al creatures, is the father and lord ouer al: so our blessyd Lady / by her merites repayryng all thynges: is the mother and Lady of all. And as almyghtie god the father dyd generate of his owne godlie substance his eterne son, by whome he hath gyuen lyfe and begynnyng to all thynges: so blessyd Mary conceyuyd and bare hym of her owne body / which restored all thynges vnto the beautie and fayrnes of theyr fyrste condicion. And as there is no thyng made or hath his beyng, but by the son of god: so ther is no thynge condempned forsaken or put to etarnall dampnacion, but that person whome Christe absolueth frome her sauiour, or whome she dothe nat fauoure or defende. Who is he that consi∣derynge these thynges with a ryght sense or wit and a pure hert,
may fully know or perceyue thexcellency of this Lady / by whom the world is erecte and raysed vp with vnspeakable grace: from so great a fall and decay? Therfore we leauyng tho thynges that can nat be searched and knowen by our naturall reason: let vs la∣bour to opteyn by prayers that we may deserue to get that in hol∣som and fruyteful effecte: which we can nat perceiue by our vnder standyng. Hereby we may perceiue that it is vnpossible that any person shuld be dampned: that is truly turned to her, and whome, she fauoreth and beholdeth. She is the mother of Christe that is our iustifier / and also she is the mother of them that shalbe iusti∣fied. She is the mother of the sauiour: and of them that shalbe sa∣uyd. How therfore may we despeire seth our health or our damp∣nacion dependeth of the wyl of our good brother & pitiful mother? Shall our good brother suffre his bretherne to perishe eternally, whom he hath redemyd so derely? Or may our pitifull mother suffre her chyldren to be dampned, whose reademar she bare in her virginall wombe? Nay suerly if we wyll forsake our syn, and cum faythfully to them. Therfore let vs wretches ioy with ye holy spirites and soules in heuen and with al creatures as moch as we may, and let vs study and labour to laude and prayse so gloriouse so mercifull a mother and virgyne / as far as our infirme & frayle nature wyl suffre.2. Reg. 6. C. The assumpcion of this gloriouse virgyn was figured in the old lawe, when as the arke of god was translate in to the house of kynge Dauid. At which tyme kynge Dauid dyd harpe and daunce before the arke of god, and so brought it in to his house with great ioy.3. Reg. 2. C. It was also figured in the mother of Salomon, for whom he made a trone, next vnto his trone, and set her therin, sayng, aske of me what thou wilt. It is nat conue∣nient or seamyng for me to deny it to the. Also it was figured by the woman which saynt Iohan speaketh of,Apo. 12. A. in his reuelacions, sayng. Signum magnum apparuit in celo. Mulier amicta sole et luna sub pedibus eius. &c. A great signe apperyd in heuyn. A woman clad or coueryd with the son, and the mone vnder her feet, and a crowne of .xii. sterres vpon her heade. This woman signifieth our Lady, which when she was assumpte vnto heuyn: was clade or compassyd about with the son that is with the glorie of the di∣uinitie of Christe. The mone was vnder her feet, for she despised the world and worldly thynges, signified by the mutable mone. She had a crowne of .xii. sterres vpon her heed, for the .xii. apo∣stles ware present at her death / or elles. It signifieth her vnspeake∣able glory. For these consideracions: all men shulde crie and call
vnto our lady Mary shuld name Mary, & shulde loue her aboue all other creatures. Both yong and olde man and woman, euery profession: shulde diligently call vpon Mary. When by our syn, we haue offendyd god the highe kynge of glorie / when we haue lost the cumpaigney of all holie aungelles and sayntes in heuyn, when also we be greuouse and moch paynfull to our selfe, & know nat what to do and whether to go for helpe: then this onely reme∣dy haue we wretched synners, that we may lifte vp our ien of our soule and body vnto the (o mercifull mother Mary) for counsell and healpe. Therfore o pitifull Lady, intend to vs, that we may receyue that profitte and effecte: for the which our Lord god was made man in thy most chaste wombe, and so liuyd here amonges men, and at last suffred death for the health and saluacion of man. To the blessyd Mary we commende vs: procure for vs and de∣fend vs, that we do nat perish euerlastyngly. Amen. A prayer. O Lord the gyuer of ioy, the graunter of solace, the diligent releuer of the desolate person, the chaser away of all heuines and sorowe, which haste gladdyd & make ioyfull the most blessed virgyn Mary thy mother the glasse of thy maiestie / the solace of aūgelles, the ymage of thy goodnes, the begynner of our helth (thou hast gladdyd her I say) wt manyfold ioyes both ī heuen and in erth: I beseach the graunt to me thy suppliant, that I which presume to com trustely and faythfully to her as to the well and fountayne of ioy in all my sorowes & trobles: may by her merites and prayers feale and receyue the effecte of her prayers and com∣forth in this present life, and finally to cum to that ineffable ioy, to ye which she assūpte ioyeth with ye eternally in heuyns. Amen. ¶Of the last iudgement and of the cummyng of the Iudge to the same the .xi. Chapiter. WE reade in scripture of .ii. cōmynges of Christe.Esaic. 62. D. 64. A.  zacha. 6. B Fyrst is past, that was when he cam to be cum man and in our nature of his manhod suffred death for ye redemp∣cion of man.Math. 24. C. . 25. C. Seconde shalbe when he shall com to iudge all man kynd. And the condycions of the iudge in this commynge:Luce. 21. be contrary vnto his condycions in his fyrst commyng, for then he cam in great meaknes / with the cōpaignye
and felowshyp of very poore people his apostles, and in his pro∣pre infirmitie and feblenes. But contrarywyse, to ye iudgement, he shall cum in great power and maiestie with the compaigney of angelles,Su{per}. Luc. Ca. 76. and in his great dignitie as a iudge. Herunto Beda sayth. He that fyrst cam in the forme and meakenes of a seruant to be iudged and also condempned: shall here after com to iudge the worlde: in the great maiestie of his deitie. And that shalbe mani∣festly and openly, nat hid in a mortal body as byfore, that tho per∣sons that contempned hym in his humilitie and mortalitie: shuld now know hym in his power and maiestie.Math. 25. C. And then he shall syt vpon the seet of his maiestie. And there shall all people be gadred byfore him: as byfore theyr iudge, And he shal separate and diuide them a sondre: as the herd man diuideth the shepe from ye gootes. In the day tyme he keapeth them to gedre in ye pasture / but in the euyntyde: he doth seuer them a sondre. So in this present life, both the good persons and also ye euyll: ben fedde to gedre in the church militante, but in the euyntyde of death or of the worlde: Christe shall seauer the good from the euyll, as shepe fro the gootes. In the shepe: is vnderstand the innocency of good men for theyr sim∣plicitie / myldnes and fruytfulnes. And in the gootes is noted the frowardnes of euyll men: for theyr filthynes, stynche stubbernes and barennes.Math. 15. C. And Christe shall set the shepe or good men on his ryght syde and the gootes: on his lefte syde, that by the same orde∣ryng in the ryght or left syde: euery person may knowe, to whom mercy shalbe shewyd: and to whom eternall payne remayneth. And the good men be conueniently set on the ryght hand: for they at theyr death ware founde on the ryght part, that is hauynge charitie and good workes. And the euyll men also be conueniētly set on the left hande: for they wolde nat folow the ryght parte by doyng of good werkes for ye loue of god. Tho be on the lefte part: which here loue temporall & vayne thynges. Tho be on the ryght parte: which here loue eternall thynges. And then shall Christe recounte and remembre the werkes of mercy vnto the good men on the ryght hande, whiche they dyd to Christe in his membres, and so shal say thus.Math. 25. C. D. Venite benedicti patris mei. &c. Com ye bels∣syd chylderne of my father, possesse and receyue ye the kyngdom prepared for you byfore the begynnyng of the world. I was hun∣gry: and ye fedde me. I was thristy: and ye gaue me drynke. I was without lodgyng: and ye harbored me. I was seake: and ye dyd visite me. I was in prison: and ye cam to me. I was naked: and ye clothed me. Then the good and iuste persones (as fliynge
theyr owne commendacions and praysynges) shall aske, when they dyd any such thynge to hym. And Christe shall say to them truly I say to you, as ofte as ye dyd any of these thynges vnto one of these my leste bredren: ye dyd it to me. Tho be his bredren: that fulfyll the wyll of his father in heuyn, they be also called the leste: for that they be meke and in this life abiecte or dispised. And note here that though we spake here but of .vi. werkes of mercy, that is bicause,Math. 25. D. there be no mo remembred by our sauiour Christ in the gospell of Mathewe / yet we say cōmonly that there be .vii. werkes of mercy, and truth it is, for the .vii. is to bury the deed bodyes,Tob. 1. D. 2. A. & 12. C. which is taken of the boke of Toby, for he vsed the same to his great rewarde and our example. And these .vii. werkes be conteyned in this verse. Visito, poto, cibo, tego, redimo, colligo, condo. So that euery word noteth one werke of mercy. The fyrst worde. Visito, noteth the visityng of them that be seke. Second. Poto. to gyue drynke to ye thristy. Thyrd. Cibo, to fede the hungry. Fourth. Tego. to couer the naked. Fyfth. Redimo. to redeame the prisoner.Ibidem. Syxt. Colligo. to lodge the harborles. Seuenth. Condo. to bury the deed.Math. 25. D. Also the iudge shall say to them that be on ye lefte hand. Discedite a me maledicti in ignem eternum. &c. Depart from me you cursed people in to euerlastynge fyre, which is prepared for the deuyll and his aungelles. I was hungry: and ye wold nat feade me. I was thristy: and ye gaue me no drynke and so all the other .vi. forsaid werkes of mercy. Then the euyll men shall an∣swere. Lord when dyd we se the hungry / thristy, naked / seke / her∣borles or in prison: and we haue nat conforted the? Then our lord shall say, when ye wold nat do these thynges to one of these onys: ye wold nat do it to me. And here note that this question mouyd by the good or euyll persons: doth nat procede of any ignorance / for the iuste and good persons shal know that ye werkes of mercy done to the membres of Christe in his name and for his loue: he reputeth those good dedes as done to hym selfe, & also they know that they shall haue a great reward therby. And in like maner the euyll persons shall knowe / that they shalbe dampned for the con∣trary. And therfore / they asked nat that question of any ignorāce: but it is a question of great admiration and meruell, for ye great∣nes of grace and glorie, whiche shalbe gyuen to the iuste people for those good werkes, and also for the intollerable myserie and payne that shall fall vpon the euyll persons for theyr hardnes and vnmercifulnes.Iaco. 2. C. And so hard iudgement without mercy: shalbe done to hym that wold shewe or do no mercy. What shall they de∣serue
that steale and rauishe other mennys goodes: sythe they be eternally dampned, which wyll nat gyue theyr owne goodes in almosse? If the vnmerciful people shal suffre so greuouse paynes what shall they suffre that be cruell?S Math. omel. 80. And note here as Crisostom sayth, that the payne of euyll persons is euerlastyng, and so is the rewarde of good men. For as eternall synnes don passe for ye acte or doyng after that they be don, but yet there remayneth the gylt or offence towardes god, which shalbe punished. So good wer∣kes don for the loue of god / don passe to speake of the acte or dede: but yet they remayne in theyr merite & so to be rewardyd of god. Also saynt Hierom sayth:S Math. 25. in fine. thou wyse reader attende and remēbre diligently, that both the paynes of hell be eternall, and also the glorie of heuyn, for that life shall haue no feare of decay or death. And therfore the euangelist sayth,Math. 25. D. that the euyll men shall go to eternall fyre, and the iuste men to euerlastynge life / and ioy of he∣uyn which was prepared for them byfore the begynnynge of the worlde, for therunto they ware predestinate. And note wele here / that the predestination of god is nat the necessarie cause of thy sal¦uation. For the predestination of god is euer condicionally, that there is no thyng predestinate but vnder som cōdicion, as it was predestinate that the worlde shulde be sauid: but that was by the death of the son of god and by the watre of baptisme, so that they wold receyue it and liue therafter. Also all good and iuste men be predestinate to glorie eternall, yet with this condicion, if they contine we in true fayth / charitie / humilitie or meknes, pacience mercie / pitie, with other vertues & the operacion of them, whom our lord doth predestinate to life euerlastyng, he seeth & knoweth byfore that they shal haue such vertues, as if in his predestinacion he myght say to them. I do predestinate you to glorie: if ye haue such vertues: if ye keape my commaundimentes. &c. Who so wyll nat keape goddes commaundymentes / wyl nat continue in fayth with charitie and good werkes. &c. he shall nat com to the end of predestinacion, that is to the glory of heuyn: for he wyl nat keape the condicion therof. Therfore do nat ouermoch attend and trust to the predestinacion of god which thou knowes nat: but rather attend to the wordes of god, which thou heris, and knowis. For as god is true, and can nat be chaungeable: so his wordes be true and can nat be chaunged.Ca. 33. C. But let vs here, what be those wordes of god.Ca. 18. E. G. The prophet Ezechiel sayth in the person of god. Nolo mortem impij sed vt conuertatur a via sua et viuat. Si autem impius egerit poenitentiam ab omnibus peccatis suis, et custodierit omnia
precepta mea: vita viuet. I wyll nat (sayth almyghty god) the deth of a synner: but rather that he be conuertyd from his syn and liue in grace: for if the synner do penaunce or be sory for all his synnes that he hath don & keape all my preceptes and do true iudgement and iustice, he shalliue here in grace & he shall nat dye eternally. Also he sayth.Marci. xvi. Qui crediderit et baptisatus fuerit: saluuus erit. He that beleuith and is baptised and so continueth in that true fayth and promise made at his baptisme: he shalbe saued. Also he sayth. Si vis ad vitam ingredi:Math. 6. B serua mandata. If thou wylt cum to lyfe e∣uerlastyng: keape the commaundimentes. And in an other place Christ sayth.Math. 19. C. Si dimiseritis homnibus pecata eorum: dimittet vobis pater me{us} pecata vestra. If ye forgyue to other men theyr offensis don to you: my heuenly father shall forgyue to you your synnes. In these wordes and many other lyke standeth our predestina∣cion to lyfe, or our reprouyng to death euer lastyng. And loke for none other predestinacion. If thou keape these saynges of god: thou shalbe sure. Therfore say nat as many vnwyse persons say. I am predestinate of god to be sauyd, therfore I can nat be damp¦ned, though I neuer pray, nor do any other good deade. For I assure the, that if thou keape nat the commaūdimentes of god. &c. thou shalbe damned, wherfore be ware of such folyshe saynges, for the predestinacion of god is so ordred: that it may be obteyned and goten by prayers and other good laboures and werkes. And hereunto saynt Austen sayth: if thou be nat predestinate: labour that thou may be predestinate. For as god seeth byfore that a man shalbe sauyd: so he seeth ye meane and maner how he shalbe sauyd, that is he seeth how he shall for sake his syn, and labour for grace and keape the wyll of god and so be sauyd. A prayer. O Lord Iesu Christe iudge of both quicke and deed vouch¦safe to order and set me in the last iudgement on thy ryght hand, and that I may then heare thy most swete voyce to my comforth which thou shall then speake to thy chosen people, that is. Cum ye blessyd chylderne of my father, & take possessyon of the kyngdome of glorie: that was prepared for you byfore the begynnyng of the worlde. And also keape me, that I feare nat the hearynge of that moste terrible sentence / which then thou shalt speake vnto the reprouyd synners, saynge. Go ye cursed people in to euerlasting fyer prepared for the dyuel and his compaygny
O thou onely begoten son of god, haue mercy on vs, that we ne∣uer fele that incurable and intollerable payne, that is, to be ex∣cludyd from the glory and syght of god and to be burned perpetu¦ally in euerlastyng fyre. O my god my mercy and socour: be mer∣cifull to vs. Amen. ¶: Thus endeth this lytell treatyse called the Glasse or Myrrour of Christes passion.
