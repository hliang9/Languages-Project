The Paraphrase of Erasm{us} Roterdame vpon ye Epistle of saīt Paule vnto his discy¦ple Titus. lately trāslated in to englysshe and fyrste a goodly▪ prologue ¶Cum priuilegio Regali. Iohan Byddell.
uered his olde bryghtnes / & shy∣neth so abrode now / yt euen they whose inwarde eyes be blynded with false perswasyons of man and couetyse & vayneglorye per∣ceyue a twynkeling of this light. For they can not deny but yt they haue erred in many thynges and were fer wyde fro ye square / how lothe so euer they be to heare it of laye men / or of suche as beynge good preestes / wolde fayne call theym agayne to his doctryne / who alone is the waye / ye trouth & lyfe. And what can be a more euydent token of ye hye indygna∣cyon of the godhed agaynste the chyrche of Rome, then that this Pharao and all his egyptiens be so hardened in theyr hertes, that they wyll in no wyse receyue the truthe & doctryne of hym whose folowers they professe themselfe
to be. Of whome may full well be affyrmed the wordes of ye pro∣phete Dauid. Eyes they haue / & shall not se. Eeres they haue, and shall not heare. wherfore no mer∣uayle / for they are so drowned in the desyres of worldly worshyp, yt where as they shold saye with ye apostles to Chryst, Marci. x. lo we haue left all / & haue folowed ye / they can not saye (yf they shall not lye) but the clene contrary / yt they forsake nothyng / but catche all to them selfe and forsake him. wherfore the same prophet Da∣uid fearyng this displeasure and greate angre of god fallen vpon the papystes / and desyrynge the grace shewed now to vs / pray∣eth on this wyse. Lord make thy waies knowē to me / & teache me thy pathes. And why prayeth he so▪ For as he writeth in an other
place. Cursed be they good lorde that swarue from thy commaū∣dementes. Now who swarueth more from the cōmaundementes of god / thē he which taketh vpō hym to be an herdes man / and a feder of Crystes shepe / & dryueth them away from theyr mete / nor playeth the good & iust husbond of goddes house / so wynge spiry∣tual thynges & repynge therfore carnall, but he repeth carnall thi∣ges / for ye sowyng of ye vnthrifty cockle of most foule and abomy∣nable errors / and seducynge the people of god after his moste de∣testable lustes. which word good redar I wold not yt thou sholdest thynke to be spoken generally of all spyrytuall men. For there are among thē thanked be god hyely therfore, men endued with great cōnynge / wysedom / & vertuous
liuing. whose workes according to the cōmaundement of the gos∣pell, do shyne afore all men to the glorye of the father of heuyn. A∣gaine thou must not so interprete my sayenges as I sholde thynke it vnlauful for the clergy to haue ony possessyons at al. Luc. x. eue∣ry workeman saythe Chryste is worthy to haue his wages. And the apostle wrytyng to ye Corin∣thyens sayth / who is he that ser∣ueth in warre at his owne coste? who planteth a vyne and eateth not of ye frut therof? who feadeth a flocke and eateh not of ye mylke of the flocke? But I meaned of suche as haue possessyons & do∣mynyons more lyke to kynges & em{per}ours then spyritual fathers. not noryshynge with them prea∣chers of goddes worde and theyr nedy bretherne, but for preachers
of Crystes lawes / thei fede suche as p̄ache theyr decrees. And thē ye lyke Annas / Cayphas / Ioēs and Alexandre / of whome men∣tyon is made in the actes of the apostles forbyd men to speake or teache ī ye name of Iesu / for they will not haue his gospell taught nor spoken of, which Christ wold haue preached vpon houses. To rede ye new testament with them is heresy, which is no thyng elles saue Chrystes wordes & his dys∣cyples. And for norysshynge of poore folke, they maȳtaine other, litle or nothyng regarding them that they shold regarde / but euen passe them by / as our lorde men∣cyoneth in the gospell of ye preest & leuyte / that were moued with no pytye to socour the man that laye in ye way robbed & wounded. Agaynste suche preestes / and all
suche as by fayned holynes and hypocrycy seduce goddes people from his teachyng & ye instructy∣ons of his apostles to theyr fay∣ned dremes. Agaynst thē, cryeth scrypture in many places. Harke what Hieremie writeh in ye. xxiii. chapitre. wo be to she{per}des which dysperple & all to teare the flocke of my pasture, therfore these wor∣des sayth the lord god of Israell to sheperdes that fede my people. You haue scatered myne herde & throwne them out and not visy∣ted them. Lo I shall visite vpon you the malyce of your studyes saythe our lorde. And Ezechyell in the .xxxiiii. chapytre. wo be to the sheperdes of Israell / whiche dyd fede them selfe. Be not her∣des fed of theyr herdesmen / you dyd eate the mylke and with the wolles you were couered, & what
so euer was fatte / you kylled it. But my flocke you dyd not feade you dyd not consolidate yt which was weake / you healed not that whiche was syk / you bound not to gyther yt whiche was broken / you brought not againe yt which was abiecte / and you sought not that which was lost / but you ru∣led them with austerite & power. And my shepe were skatered a∣brode, because there was no shep∣herd / and they were deuoured of all the beastes of the feelde & dys∣perpled. My herdes haue erred in all mountaynes / and in euery hy hyll / & vpon all the face of the erthe my herd hath ben all to ska∣tered / & none there was ye wolde seke them. Therfore shepherdes here you the wordes of our lord. I lyue saith ys lord god. Bycause that my flockes haue bene made
in to rapyne and my shepe to the deuouryng of beastes of ye felde / bycause there was no shepeherd / nor the shepeherdes dyd not seke my flocke / but the shepherdes did feade them selues / & they dyd not feade my herdes / therfore shepe∣herdes heare you the wordes of our lord. This sayth ye lord god. Lo I shall requyre of the shepe∣herdes myne herde oute of theyr honde / and I shall make them to cease that they feade no more my flocke / nor that ye shepherdes can no more feade theym selues. And I will deliuer my flocke frō theyr mouth / & it shall be no more eatē vp of them. &c. Se here most gē∣tle reader the angre of god eny∣dently fallen vpon the bysshop of Romes tyrannye / and his adhe∣rentes whose proude power day∣lye decreaseth according to ye say∣enges
of this prophete / for theyr deuourynge of Chrystes flocke. And se also on the other syde the greate goodnes of god towarde our Englysshe nacyon / whiche hathe delyuered vs oute of his rauenyng mouth / and gyuen vs our hed & herdes man our moste redoubted souerayne / whome he hath made the veray defender of the fayth and an hed shepherd to set suche herdes men vnder hym / which shall fede vs & not deuour vs. Is not this a greate token gentle redar / that almyghty god is well content with this gracy∣ous & veray fortunate maryage / whiche hath sente vs the light of his lawes sens that tyme & hath brought vs out of the thraldome of yll bysshops. And as he made kynge Dauid keper of his herd of Israell as it is expressed of the
prophet in the forsayd chapytre / euen so he hath by the voice of his people / chosen our most noble & vertuous kynge Henry to be hed of his Englishe flocke, as well in spirituall gouernaūce as in erth∣ly domynyon. Let here no man murmour as some do yet / yt his grace is electe to be hedde of the chyrche in his realme / no forther then goddes lawes do permyt / as who saith, there is in yt pointe an obstacle. For why sholde not by goddes lawe our kynge and souerayne lord be our hed herdes man as well as Dauid beynge a lay prynce was hed shepehered to his flocke of Israell? Now wher can ony of them fynde one iote in scripture that proueth theyr most holy father to be aboue kynges or temporall rulers? peraduenture, they wyll brynge forth for them,
that Peter sayde to our lorde, lo lorde here be. ii. swerdes & therof inferre / that he & his successours had giuen to them hy power both ouer spyrytuall & also temporall. In good soth this is a ioyly smal reason and worthy to come oute of a profoūde sophysters mouth, euen as who wold say. Yf when the kynges grace rydeth in to the forest on hūtyng / one shewe him an hart or two, ergo by and by he is chefe foster of ye hole londe. Ad populū phaleras / as {per}sius saith. Let them blere good sely pore sȳ∣ple folkes eyes / with these gew∣gawes / for other men seith their lygyer de mayne well ynoughe. what saith Peter him selfe doeth he ascrybe ony such power to him or ony other of his teachyng. Be you obedyente saythe he to euery humayne creature for our lordes
sake / eyther to the kynge as most excellente (marke you he calleth kinges most excellent, & vsurpeth no suche tytle to hym selfe) or to other guydes as sente of hym. Saint Paule sayth that all tem∣porall power is of god / & he byd∣deth in diuers places to be obedi∣ent to temporall prynces. Some hystoryes also make mencyon, yt ye bysshop of Rome toke not vpon hym to be hed of the chyrche tyll ye yeare of our lord. C. xv. Ergo then yf this hystorye be true it is a false tale to saye yt this double power was giuē to Peter of god, seyng that neyther he nor a dosen mo of his successours (graunted yt he was pope) toke it not vpon theym tyll one vyctor waxed so stoute / & yet he vsurped no tēpo∣rall power, how that came in I report me to them. Saint Paule
neuer sayde of the apostles that they bare ony swerde, but of tem∣porall prynces he sayd that they here not a swerde without cause. It is meate for vs then to gyue to god that is his / & to our kyng yt is his. who as thou seest hathe the rule ouer vs vnder god & not ye bysshop of Rome. And hyghly we are bounde to thanke the bles∣sed Trinite / that ye eyes of faith∣full people be vncouered to se the truthe. wherfore I confesse that I was my selfe a greate whyle blynded & went asyde in the coū∣sell of wycked men. psal. j. & stode a longe season in the way of syn∣ners / yea & sate fast in the chayre of pestilence. But I thanke our blessed sauyour whiche dyuerslye calleth whome he lyft to hym / he hath vncouered myn eyes which were blyndfelde with two foule
cloutes of ygnoraunce and false perswasion / & he hathe made me haue an occasyon to loke better on his doctryne / and to perceyue the errour that I was deceyued in / as Horace saythe. specie recti. and thynkynge there to be ryght where none was / & there wrong where the ryght was. wherfore sens as I truste I haue escaped the foule storme of false beleue. For what shall I call els ye trust in papystycall power. I haue to ye entent to help other set forth in englisshe thept'e of saint Paule to his discyple Tyte which techeth howe moche and howe straytly we be bounde to obey next God our kyng & souerayne lorde. For as he writeth in the. xii. chapitre to the Romaynes / who resisteth agaynste them resysteth agaynst the ordinaunce of god. And who
resyste agaynst gods ordynaūce, they purchase theyr owne damp∣nacyon. Agayne yf chrysten men be bounde to obey theyr prynces though thei be miscreaūtes, how moche more be we bounden to o∣bey our most vertuous & christen kyng & lord / which so dyligently laboreth with all his hole entent to haue vs the veraye shepe of Chrystes folde and to delyuer vs also / from ye daūger of rauenyng wolues. wherfore no doubte but god of his goodnes wyll longe preserue hym & defend hym from his enemyes. Besyde this epystle sheweth euery man both spirytu∣all and temporall, how he ought to vse him selfe, that he may after this lyfe be pertener of that lyfe / wherunto we are all bought / & shall yf we lyue well not fayle to come to, not by pardons bought
from Rome / but by the merytes of Chrystes passion. wherfore I with hole hert and mynde besech the good redar yf thou fynde ony frute herein / as no doubte but y• shalte, and that largely / endeuer thy selfe as nere as god will giue y• grace to liue according to saint Paules doctryne, & next to praye the blessed Trinite to graunt me his grace to leue from hens forth the blyndnes of synne and to lyue after ye lawes of god & my prince. And to thentent yu shalt ye better perceyue what this holy apostle hathe wryten: I haue added to / ye paraphrase of Erasmus which shall make all thyng playne to the. The grace and peace of God be wt the and me and all good chrysten people. Amen.
The Epistle of Paule vnto Tytus. PAule the seruante of God and an Apostle of Ihesu Chryste: to preache the faythe of goddes electe / and ye knowlege of the truthe / whiche truthe is in seruyng god / in hope of eternall lyfe / whiche lyfe god that cannot lye / hathe promysed before ye worlde began / but hath at the tyme apointed opened his wordes by preachynge / whiche preachyng is cōmytted vnto me, by the commaundement god our sauyour, to Tytus his naturall sone in the comen faythe. Grace / mercye / and peace from god the father / and frome the lorde Iesu Christ our sauyour.
For this cause left I y• in Crete, that thou sholdest pfourme that, which was lackyng and sholdest ordeyne senyours in euery Cytye as I apoynted ye / yf ony be suche as no man can complayn on / the husbond of one woman, hauing faythful chyldren / which are not sclaundered of ryot / neyther are dysobedyent. For a bysshop must be such as no man can complaine on as it becometh the ministre of god / not stubborne, not angrye / no dronkard / no fyghter / nor ge∣uē to filthy lucre / but herberous / one ye loueth goodnes / of honest behaueour / rygtuous, holy / tem∣perat / and suche as cleueth vnto the true worde of doctryne / that he may be able to exorte wt whol∣som learnynge / and to ymproue theym that saye agaynste it. For there are many disobedyent / and
talkers of vanyte, and disceyuers of myndes, namely they of ye cir∣cumcisyon, whose mouthes must be stopped whiche peruert hole housses teachyng thinges which they ought not because of fylthy lucre. One beyng of them selues which was a poete of their owne, said. The Cretayns are alwaies liars, euill beastes, & slow bellies. This wytnes is true / wherfore rebuke theym sharpely / that they may be sounde in the faythe / and not takyng hede to iewes fables, and commaundementes of men, which turne from ye truth. Unto ye pur / are all thynges pure / but vnto theym that are defyled / and vnbeleuyng is nothing pure, but euen yt very mindes & cōscyences of them are deyled. They cōfesse yt they knowe god / but wt dedes thei deny him / & are abominable /
and dysobedient / & vnto all good workes dyscomendable. The seconde chapytre. BUt speake thou yt whiche becommeth holsome lear ninge / that the elder men be sobre, honest, dyscrete, sound. in the fayth in loue and patience And the elder women lyke wyse that they be in suche rayment / as becommeth holynes / not false ac¦cusars / not geuen to moche dryn kynge / but teachers of honeste thynges / yt they nurter the yong women for to loue theyr husban∣des / to loue theyr chyldren / to be of honeste behaueour chast / hus∣wyfely / good and obedient / vnto theyr owne husbandes, that the worde of god be not euyl spoken of. Yonge men lyke wyse exhorte
that they be of honeste manets. Aboue all thynges shew thy selfe an insample of good workes in ye doctryne shewe vncorruptio / ho∣nesty & the holsom worde / which can not be rebuked / yt he whiche withstondeth may be asshamed / hauynge nothyng in you that he may dysprayse. The seruauntes exhort to be obedyent vnto theyr owne maysters / & to please in all thinges, not answeryng agayne, neyther be pyckers, but that they shewe all good faythfullnes that thei may do worship to ye doctrin of god our sauiour in all thȳges. For the grace of god yt bryngeth health vnto all men: hath apered and teacheth vs that we sholde denye vngodlynes / and worldly lustes, and that we shold lyue ho¦nestly, tyghtuously / and godly in this present world, lokynge for
that blessed hope and gloryouse aperyng of the myghty god / and our sauyour Iesu Christ, which gaue hym selfe for vs / to redeme vs frome all vnryghtuousnes / & to pourdge vs a peculyer people vnto hym selfe / feruently geuen vnto good workes. These thyn∣ges speake / and exhorte, & rebuke with all cōmaundyng. Se that no man despyse the. The thyrde chapytre WArne them that they submyt them selues to princes & suche as haue power ouer thē to obey theyr cōmaūdment / that they be prompte vnto all good workes, that they speake euyll of no man / yt they be no fyghters / but softe / shewynge all mekenes
vnto all men / for we our selues also were in tymes past, vnwyse, dysobedyent / deceaued / in daun∣ger / to lustes and to dyuers ma∣ners of voluptuousnes / lyuynge in malycyousnes / and enuye, full of hate hatyng one another. But after that the kyndnes / and loue of our sauyour to manward ape∣red not of the dedes / of ryghtu∣ousnes whiche we wrought / but of his mercye he saued vs, by the fountayne of the newe byrthe & wt the renuyng of the holy goost / which he shed on vs aboūdantly thrughe Iesus Chryst our sauy∣our / yt we ons iustifyed by grace / sholde be heyres of eternall lyfe / thrugh hope. This is a true say∣enge. ¶ Of these thynges I wold thou sholdest certefy / that they which beleue god, myght be stodiouse to go forward in good
workes. These thinges are good & profytable vnto men. Folyshe questyons and genealogyes and braulynges and stryfe aboute the lawe auoyde, for they are vnpro∣fytable / superfluous. A man that is ye auctor of fectes after ye fyrste & seconde admonysshyon auoyde hym / remembrynge that he that is suche is peruerted and syn̄eth / euen dampned by his own iudge mēt. when I shall send Artemas or Tichicus be dylygent to come to me vnto Nycopolys. For I haue determined there to winter. Bryng zenas ye lawyer & Apollos on theyr iorney dylygently / that nothyng be lackyng vnto them. And let oures also learne to excel in good workes as farforthe as nede requyreth / that they be not vnfrutfull. All that are with me salute the. Grete them that loue
vs in the faythe. Grace be with you all. Amen. wryten frome Nicopolis a citie of Macedonia. Here begȳneth the Paraphrase of Erasmus of Roterdame vpō saint Paules Epse to his dyscyple Tytus. I PAule my selfe the sworne seruant and obeyer / not of Moy¦ses lawe as I was ones / but of the law of god the father / and Embassa∣dour of his sone Iesu Chryst. Of the whyche myne Embassade or cōmissyon the hole effecte is this, that suche as god hathe electe to euangelycal helthe / them I shold exhorte and call / not to ye obser∣uacyon of ye olde lawe / or to put
theyr trust in theyr workes / but I must moue thē to faith / which only openeth to all men ye entrȳg to euerlastynge lyfe / thrughe the free goodnes of Iesu Chryste. And my cōmyssyon is not to call them to faith onely / but also to ye knowleg of trueth which among the gentyles was ouerheaped & doluen in the imagynacyons and fayned Inuentyons of worldly wysdom. And among the iewes it was had in shadowes & wrap∣pinges of figures. I am enchar∣ged I say to call men to ye know∣lege of truthe / not that whiche ye phylosophers of this worlde do teache / dysputyng on the causes of naturall thynges / but to the knowlege of the truthe, whiche compendiously sheweth in what thynges true chrysten lyuyng is set / whose ende and rewarde is
euerlastyng lyfe / folowyng after this shorte lyfe that we lede here in this worlde, which euerlastig lyfe all good and godly lyuers ought with ye more trust to hope for / in how so euer great tribula∣tions and euylles of this worlde they be. Fyrste by cause he yt pro∣mysed them this lyfe euerlasting was not a man that myght both be deceyuyd hym selfe, and also deceyue other / but it was god hȳselfe / which as it can not be cho∣sen / but he must nedes abyde styll god / so can nothynge surely pro∣cede from hym / but ye mere truth. And agayne bycause this that he promysed, he dyd not promyse it by chaunce, or nowe of late / but afore that the worlde was made it was fyxed & fully determyned by ye deuyne and vnchaungeable decre of his mynde to do yt which
he now doeth. There is no newe thynge come to his purpose / but that thynge which for secrete cau¦ses onely knowen to the godhed he wolde haue hytherto couered and hyd / that wold he haue ope∣ned to all the world at this tyme whiche by his euerlastynge wys∣dome he had afore appoynted to this busynes. Nor he wolde not that there sholde be onely shewed to the Iewes a darke shadow of ye fygures of some blynde thyng and harde to be discussed / but his wyll is to haue a playne truth to be made open by ye open & playne preachynge of the gospell to all men, wtoute ony dyuersyte eyther of nation or tongue. This is the sum and hole effect of ye doctryne of the gospell / ye p̄chyng wherof I haue not takē vpō me of myne owne hed / but it was cōmytted
to me and not by men / but by our sauyour god / who not onely cal∣led me to ye occupieng of an apt'es roume and offyce / but also he en∣ioyned it me / yea & so he charged me therwith / yt it was not lauful or free for me to say naye to that whiche he cōmaunded me to do / which wordes I haue spoken to thentent yt no man sholde thynke myn authorite to be yhgt / or els theyr authoryte / whome I haue put ony where i my stede. I ther∣fore ye same Paule beyng in suche authoryte do wryte this letter to Titus my true and naturall son / not by bodely generacyon but by the sede of faythe, which I haue so shed in to hym and in ye which he so well resembleth me / that I seme to be renewed in hym lyke as a father is in his owne natu∣rall son. To hym I whissh that
there may come grace and peace from hym / from whome all very goodnes dothe come / that is to saye from god the father and his son Iesu Chryste ye onely author of our helth. For in suche ryches, as grace, & peace are, my desire is to haue my chyldren made ryche. But to speake now to the my son Tytus, syth I dyd knowe ryght well the nature of this Ilonde / and againe I dyd not doubt but that they had nede of a faythfull and dilygēt creanser or ouerseer / I haue for that cause lefte the in Crete as representyng myn own person, bycause that the busynes of the gospell calleth me to other places / yt suche thynges as haue there begō to be corrected by me / thou as my deputye maye make make an ende of thē. And because yt thou alone art not able to ouer∣loke
so many cytyes as this He is replenysshed wt / yu shalt ordeyn in euery cytye an hedde preest or bysshop as I whē I depted dyd dyd the / But beware that thou admyt no man to so hye an offyce without greate dyscressyon / for he must be a very proued man to whome thou shalte betake this charge / and not all onelye of a knowen and testyfyed honestye / but also he must be clere from all supycyon of any maner of faute what so euer it be. Suche a bys∣shop or ouerseer to thent ēt that yu mayst ye better and surelyer those out / I wyll set hym forth by cer∣tayne sygnes / yea and in maner paynt hym to the. Yf thou know ony man to be of suche maners & that vpryght lyuyng / yt no faut can prouable be layde to hym. Yf ony man beyng content with one
matrimony geue no token of vn∣chast lyuyng / if he haue chyldren so instructe and brought vp, that not onely in the knowlaigyng of Chrystes faythe / but also by the innocency of theyr lyuynge they shew them selfe to be chrystē mē / that is to saye not yll named for ryot, as ye cōmune sort of yonge men be / nor dysobedyent to theyr father and mother. For he that shall be counted worthye to be a bisshop must be so fer wyde from all vyce & besyde that fro ye suspi∣cyon of ony vyce / that he muste marke that he not onely kepe his owne honesty / but also of all his householde, for the fautes of the chyldren are wonte cōmunely to be reproched to the fathers & mo∣thers. Now what soeuer hurteth ye good name of a bysshop / it tur∣neth to ye sclaūder of the gospell of
Chryste. It is necessary therfore yt he whiche in a maner stondeth in goddes stede / and to whome ye treasure of the teachyng of ye gos∣pell as to a chosen dispēser therof is commytted be in all poyntes without blame / and a great way from the vyces of theym whiche cōmunely here offycys / that they which be vnder hym, may be vn∣der him wyllyngly, and with all the hert in theyr body. He muste loke vpon nothyng but the soule helth of the flocke that is betaken to hym / he must study to amende and not to oppresse / to teache not to compell, to lede & not to draw / he muste perswade rather then callynge for dutye / he must ouer∣com more by benefites and suffe∣raunce / then by lordlynesse and hy spyryte. He that shall occupye this rome I say must not be stub∣berne /
angry / nor hasty ī spe∣king /  hich thinges men will sooner withdrawe theyr hertes then folow ony doctrine, he must also in ony wyse beware of coue∣tyse and gapynge after lucre for that thynge is vyle and pestylent in ony laye offycer, & moche more to be abhorred in a bisshop or ony spyrytuall man. For he that is infecte with the vyce of auaryce doth nothyng vpryghtly, and as of equyte it shold be done. A bys∣shop muste besyde these be sober, iust in innocency of lyfe, vertuo{us} and godly in the obseruacyon of Chrystes faythe and relygion of the gospell, not subiecte to ony yll affectiōs, but ferre aboue all such desyres by whiche the commune sorte of men are led vp & downe. But chefyly he must be a stedfast holder of the wordes of ye gospell,
wherin he is bound to  ell in∣structe / that he may teache suche as be ignorant in those thynges that {per}teyne to theyr soule helthe, & that he may with holsom doc∣tryne exhorte and call forwarde theym that are slow and repreue them yt speake agaynst the truth. I do not warne the of these thin∣ges causeles / for there be many waywarde parsons / brabelers & deceyuers of mennes myndes / which not geuyng an eere to the teaching of ye gospel, brȳg ī stede of it vayne & vnprofitable fables of ye iewes, wherby they may get them a name of lernyng among ye people, & wynnynge also. And by these fables they entise ye min∣des of some symple folke & begile them crawlyng vnder the colour of the gospell in to the mindes of theyr herars, in so moche y• many
tymes they corrupte not one or two, but they ouert̄ne hole house∣holdes and kynredes, teachynge shamefull thynges / & far square from the verite of ye gospell. And yet for al yt they abuse the tytle of the gospell to the lucre / whiche vilanously they daily hunt after / wherfore se yt you rebuke theym sharply and shyt theyr mouthes. There be some of the gentyles yt be combred with this enormyty / but specyally yu shalt fynde them of this malitious secte, which be iewes cōuerted to Chryst, which vntruely teache the gospell / men∣glynge alwayes ther wt ye lawes of moyses, and wyll not leaue in ony wyse the false superstition of the iewes. And it is no meruaile to haue suche men foūd in Crete, that fede their belies with brabe∣lyng and naughty waies / sythen
mani yeares agone Epimenides the poete, whiche was hym selfe a mā of Crete, did speke of them / which wordes were these, Men of Creete be alwayes lyars / yll beestes / & slothfull belyes which wytnes is so true yt it maye seme well ynoughe to be spokē of god¦des own mouthe. Be not they na¦tural lyers which fere not to dar¦ken the mooste clere lyght of the truth of the gospell with theyr fa¦bles. Be not they noyfull beastes whiche in euery place blow theyr venom on symple persones / that be not ware of them. Be not they slouthfull belyes, whiche had le∣uer by false doctrine to lyue in I∣delnes and rankly, then for ye de∣fence of the gospel to lyue in hun¦gre, & be shrewdly handled many tymes as we be? werfore rebuke suche naughty packes ernestly, yt
they may amend / and leuyng the truste that they haue in the cere∣monyes of ye olde lawe / they mai¦geue theim selfe holy to the truth of ye gospell. And that they geue not theyr eeres to such vnthrifty tales of the Iewes / thrughe the whiche the preceptes of Chryste are let go / and constytutions of men are brought in / of the obser∣uations of new mones / of the ke¦pynges of the sabbot / of cyrcum∣cisyon / of wasshynges / of choyse of meates / of clothing, of certeine thȳges that may not be touched / of the house seuen dayes vnclene, & other lyke to these, whiche god for a tyme cōmaunded to be kept of ye Iewes / partly that that na∣cyon beyng rebell and vnweyldy to be ordered / myght be holden & kepte vnder by the multytude of preceptes or cōmaundementes /
partely that these thynges shold be as shadowes of true thynges that were to come. But they are now vtterly of none effect so mo∣che yt yf ony man wyll contynew styll to obserue these thiges after the maner of ye Iewes / nothyng can turne them more from the ve¦rite of the gospell. For there is no nation yt more stubbernely doeth rebel agaist ye gospel / thā ye Iues doo / which can in no wyse leaue these folyshe tryfles. This meate (say they) is vncleane eate it not. This body is vncleene touche it not / hens awai with these dyuer sytees amonge Christen men / to whom as they be cleane / all thyn¦ges are clane / nor they sholde ab∣horre nothynge yt god hath made for ye vse of man. And as to them yt be pure christē men / nothing is impure or vnclene, so to ye Iewes
whose mindes are filthy and vn∣clene, nothig is clene, not so moch as they that ye olde law suffereth and doth permyt as clene, for se∣ynge they mystrust hym whiche after the openyng of the gospell wold haue all these thynges not obserued after ye fleshly & litterall sence, but to be referred to the bu∣synesse of the soule. what thynge can be pure to them, whose mind are spotted & infecte wt mistrust / & their liuyng defyled with inor∣dinate wast / ambytion, couetise, and other vyces. They vpholde the lawe with to the & nayle / and yet they wote not what the lawe meaneth. They haue their p̄puce circūcysed / but ye mynd wtin is vn¦circūcised. They go i to ye tēple wt hōdes & fete wasshed, but ye soule & cōsciēce is vnwasshed. They ke¦pe their sabbot holy from bodely
workes / but in the meane tyme / they haue theyr breste vnquyeted with hate, anger, simony / & other troubles of the soule. They fere to be contamynate yf they taste porke or pygge / but they thynke them selfes clene when they with gredy eeres here foule comunyca∣cion & bakbityng of other. They thynke them selfes fyled yf they touche ony caren / but yet thei ab∣horre not to touche a quene or sto¦len geare. They thynke it a foule synne yf they vse onye garmēt of lynen and wollen mengled togy∣ther / but they stōde not amysse in theyr owne conceyte when they haue theyr brest ouercouerd with so many foule vices. It is a great shame therfore to theym to boste them selfe that they alone knowe god seyng that they deny hym in theyr dedes more then ony other.
Do they not deny him, whē they are so spotted with ye fylthyes of the soule, that they are to moste mē abhomynable, and when they be so weake, yea & deed in beleue, yt no man can handle theym. And fynally when in all dedes of true faythe and seruyce towarde god by which we sholde make god to be mercyfull to vs / they be farre wors then other men be. The second chapyter. BUt let thē go with theyr fables / let ye naughtines of these men moue the nothynge at all / but for all them remembre thyne offyce and duty, and speke tho thynges that be in¦dede mete for the lernynge of the gospell / yt is to saye whiche may make vs cōmendable to god for
our clene myndes and clene ma∣ners / & declare that we be the dy∣scyples of Chryst. But here per∣aduenture yu wylt aske me what thiges they be. Thou shalt war∣ne the elders and senyours of the people yt they be sobre / wachfull / & dylygent to all workes of ver∣tue / and that they ouercome the dulnes of theyr age wt the quike∣nes of faythe. warne them also y• they kepe grauyte and that they play not the foles lyke yong men vncomely in theyr olde age. And that they be of good and sad ma∣ners / yt the youth may haue them in reuerence and awe / & tem{per}ate them selfe that they be not way∣warde and soone an angred as ye cōmune sorte of olde men is / and wel commended of other & with out blame not onely for the inte∣gryte of theyr feythe / but also in
doynge dedes of charyte / and in suffrynge of incōmodityes & try∣bulations, namely for the gospell of christ. On ye same maner thou shalt warne olde wemē that they go apparelled after suche maner as becometh theym that wyll be named chrysten folke / they must not blame the lyuynge of other / whiche faulte is peculyer to this sex and age. They muste not be geuen to ouermoche drynckynge of wyne / how be it y• vse of wyne must be permytted to age / so it be moderate. They must teche may¦dens & yong women honest thin¦ges / no nycenesse or other yll ma∣ners and so brynge them vp that they loue theyr owne husbondes and theyr children / and that they be sobre and chaste / and busy at home, and for to se theyr houses well ordered and playe the good
housewyues. For this surely is ye chefest praise yt women can haue, to be knowen subiect & obedyent to their husbondes / that by theyr lewde maners the name of god, (whose relygeon they professe) be not sclaundred. For sythen we se ye wyues of myscreauntes or he∣then men to behaue theym selfe ryght womanly in these pointes belongyng to womanhod / what shall suche infydeles say if they se christsten women in ye layd poin∣tes worse then be theyr women whome as they are chrysten / so they ought a great deale to passe them in honestye & vertue. Now what thynge old women muste by thyne instruction teache yong maydens and yong wyues / that same shalte thou thy selfe teache yong men / exhortyng them to be sobre & moderate in theyr affecti∣ons /
that ye heate of youth ouer∣throwe them not hedlynge in to viciousnes. And that thou mayst with more efficacie {per}swade these thynges. Fyrst of all be thou thy selfe to theym an exāple of honest dedes, and yt in all office of godly lyfe. For no man doeth sooner or easylyer pswade, then he whiche constantly doeth as he teacheth. Thou shalte therfore teache the youth thus, & in the meane space in teachynge lyue vprightly that thy lyfe be not corrupt with ony vyce / & kepe suche grauyte that it maye make theym to haue thy doctrine in reuerence & awe. And therfore so moderate all thy lyfe & wordes that there can nothing be founde in the / to be despysed & set at naught / so that not onelye they whiche be vnder thy loore / may obey the / but also they that
were afore agaynste the gospell, may be a shamed of theyr yll say∣enge / when they shall se all thyn∣ges in the so without blame, that they whiche lye in wayte for the, and seke all ye occasyons thei can, to chop at the, can fynde nothyng wherby they cā iustly speake ony thyng agaynst y•. As concerning seruauntes exhorte theym to be obedyente to theyr maysters and dylygente to please theym in all thynges that not by the professi∣on of Christes religion they may seme to be made wors then they were afore / and therby may be∣gynne reproch to be geuen to the gospell / when it is al the frute of naughty parsons. Let them not therfore be full of excuses, and yll wylled to do theyr masters com∣maūdemētes, nor preny pykers / as the most sorte of yll seruantes
be / that seynge they professe the gospell they declare them selfe in all seruyse to be don to theyr ma∣sters, faithful & true / yea though their masters do but litle deserue it of them. So that thrugh theyr honest maners thei may cōmend and set forth the doctryne of our sauyour god / yt by them mo men may be drawen to the folowyng of it / if men se suche as knowlege theym selfe to be christen men / to be therby more gentle and amy∣able in all theyr lyuynge. For in this thrugh ye gospel hath shined ye goodnes and gentelnes of god our sauyour not afore knowen. And it hathe not shyned onely to the iewes / but egaliy to all men, not that after we be delyuerd fro the burden of Moyses lawe / we sholde lyue after our owne wyll / but we be taught / that after that
by baptysine y• fautes of our lyfe afore past be forgeuen vs / & that we sweryng to abide by Christes wordes haue ones renoūced and geuen vp the wycked relygyon & worshipping of ymages, of ydols and with theym also all worldly desyres / so that after we sholde lede our lyfe here in this worlde that it may appere verely yt we be regenerat or new borne in Christ, and made quyte other men then we were afore. And we whiche serued afore to wyckedness / to vnhappy dedes & dyuers affecti∣ōs / which euen as it were baites drew vs to vyllanye: must from hence forth kepe suche moderatiō that we be in no wyse trobled wt desyres of worldly thynges. Let vs shew in vs iustyce / yt as moch as is in vs, we do for euery man, and hurte no man / that we may
now geue with a true professyon & hole lyfe to god suche worshyp as we gaue afore to deuyls. And though in the mean season we be punished with pouerte / barenes, sclaunder / chydynges / & dyuers other euylles / let vs not thynke that our good liuyng is baraine, nor let vs not therfore hunt after rewardes of this worlde / which be neyther in comparyson great / nor of no longe durance / but lette vs loke for that greate rewarde of euerlastyng lyfe that shal then chaunce when after yt this world is ended. In the which the mem∣bres of Chryste be yet busyed by afflyctions and sclaunders. God the father shall open in his wor∣shyppers in his glory & magnify∣cence / all theyr euylles ouercome not apperyng humble but glory∣ous and ferefull to wycked men.
And to gither with ye father shall appere in ye same glorie the lord & sauyour Iesus Christ geuyng to his mēbres yt same euerlastīg life in ye which he now shineth, for he by cause yt no man shall mystrust his {pro}mise, wittingly & willingly came to his deth, & holy gaue him selfe to vs / yt he being fre from all synne wold redeme vs by yt pryce of his blode, from ye tyrāny of the deuill / to whō by our soule syn̄es we were subiecte. And after yt he had done away cleane our offen∣ces make to hȳ of vs a new & his own people, which after his own exāple shold despise all euilles & ye enticemētes of this world & his reward trod vnder fete, shold la∣boure to get the enherytaunce of euerlasting life, which cryst doth {pro}mise to all yt kepeth ye profession of the gospel truly & wt clenelyfe.
The thyrde chapyter. THese thynges my Tyt{us} wiche be a greate deale wyde from the fabls of ye Iewes / speake them openly. Exhorte all people to fo∣low them & suche as bend away from them rebuke them with by authoryte / that such men as will not be perswaded by lerning, nor will not be moued by faire exhor∣tations, nor by sharpe & ernestful correction made to refrayne. For there be some fautes that muste be healed by seneryte. Here ther∣fore shewe forth the grauyte and authoryte of a bysshoppe and so behaue thy selfe / yt no man maye haue ony iust cause to despise the. Pryde and hawte countenaunce muste not be in the / but when so euer nede requyreth thou muste
shewe thyne authoryte. Now as I wold haue that all seruauntes sholde be to theyr maysters, yea thoughe they be gentyles / euen suche by thy monycyon wolde I haue all christē men to be to theyr prynces and to suche as are hed offycers vnder them / though su∣che prices or rulers vnder whom they be, are thē selfe vncrystened. For this muste we in ony maner of wyse take hede vnto / that no man may by our maners, catche ony occasyon to alienat him selfe fro the gospell. But it wolde so chaunce yf they that be heddes & rulers shold perceyue that we by reason of the professyon that we haue taken / were more sedicyous and stately, and lesse obedyent to theyr cōmaundemētes. For they wolde anon ley that to the faute of the gospell / & so more wtdrawe
theyr myndes fro the professyon therof. warne them therfore that beleue in Chryst / yt they be neuer the more for all that free fro the lawes & authorite of the kynges or prynces or other rulers vnder whose domyniō they be / but they muste the rather bycause they be chrysten men, be obedyente sub∣iectes / and gladly do as they be commaunded / and redy & prone to euery good worke / then men may se them do as they ought to do not beyng constrayned therto for feare of punyshment / but of theyr owne fre wyll. For yf the heddes do cōmaunde that which is ryghtfull / it is greate iniquite and a foule ensample to dysobey hym that is heed ouer all other. But agayne yf they cōmaunde & rule otherwyse then ryght is / yf they oppresse theyr subiectes to
hardly / yf they call to fore upon theym: yet gentlenes & suffrance is more comely for no man thē ye folowers of Christe. what so euer they commaunde vs that is not agaynst ye very relygyon of god / we must therin gladly obey. Thei wyll peraduēture take away our goodes / what then? For theym groweth to vs a greate treasure of good vertuous lyuyng. They wil bannishe vs out of ye contrey. It maketh no matter / for Chryst is euery where redy to cōfort his seruātes. Here peraduēture some man wyll say / what & our pryn∣ces be hethen men and worshyp∣pars of Idolles / contamynate wt open vyces / enemyes to Chri∣stes faythe. They that be suche / be such to theyr owne harme and ieoperdy / it is not our parte to condempne them but to amende
theym. And better they may be induced by obedyence / suffrance / and examples of good lyuynge / then by rebellyon / or opprobrio{us} sayenges. Let vs leue theym to their iudge / and let vs remembre what is syttynge for vs. Chryst dyd praye for them that blasphe∣myd him / so fer wide it is that he wolde gyue chek for chek / how is it then conuenyente that his discyples sholde be contumelious agaynste ony man as louers of stryfe and debate? But rather af∣ter the example of hym / whose name they do professe / they must be gentle / shewyng all myldenes not onely vnto honest men and suche as haue well deserued it / but also muste be obedyent vnto euery man. To good men bycau∣se they deserue it / to yll men that they amende / and agayne that
they haue not a wors opynion of our beleue / yf they be prouoked and angred for a cause. Chrysten charyte suffreth all thynges / and in al thynges it hath good hope. And if there be ony such yll men / we must rather pytye them, then abhorre theym. And therfore we shall do more yf we call to remēbraunce that we were somtyme such as they be now. Let vs not refuse theym by cause they are yll lyuers, and wycked men / but let vs helpe ye best that we can / that they cease to be as they be▪ and be¦gynne to be lyke vs / who called vs from our blyndnesse? was it not ye free clemencie or swete gen¦tlenes of Chryst And that same gentlenes of chryste may chaūge such men whē he will. And how be it that we which of Iewes be made chrysten men, did not wor∣shyp
Idolles / yet we were afore our conuersyon subiecte to great vices, beyng foles / iobedyent / er¦ryng / geuen to diuerse appetites & pleasures / ful of enui, ful of ma¦lice, grudgyng & hatīg one of an¦other. To these so great euylles we were subiecte euē vnder Moi∣ses lawe, but that now for foles & dulheddes we be made sobre & wyse / yt for rebelles we are meke and treatable / for men errynge / hauyng knowlege of the trueth / for the seruantes of desyres and voluptuousnes / the wyllynge ke¦pers of iustice, for malycio{us} / sim∣ple & curtes / for enuious / glad to do good / for haters, wel willyng to them that hate vs / this haue we not neyther by moyses lawe nor yet by our owne merites, but by yt free goodnes of god / by the which we coueyte that all yf it be
possible sholde reioyce with vs in a cōmune welfare / and to all mē the verite of ye gospell may shyne, as it hath shined to vs. For afore lyke blynde men we were styll in darkenes as they, but now sens there is opened by the lyght of ye gospell / how great the goodnes and charyte of god (which is au∣tour of our helthe) is to all men / then at the last we gate true lyfe after that we had put away the darkenes of our lyfe that we led afore / not thrugh the obseruatiō of Moyses law / in whome was conteyned a maner of iustice▪ but yet of lytle efficacye to geue euer∣lastynge lyfe / but thrugh the free mercye of god. For by the holy fonte of baptysme we were rege∣nerat agayne & plāted in Chryst, and by his spirite being renewed we haue ceased to be carnall and
begōne to be spirituall. Therfore what so euer we be / we are holy bounde to hym for it, which in to vs nothynge deseruynge it / shed aboundantly his spyryte / which the law coulde not geue. And by Iesu Chryste he shed his spyryte in to vs, by whō it hathe pleased him to geue vs all thynges / that we being purged by his benefite, frō our olde synnes shold enforce by good workes to be made apte to take ye enherytaūce of immor∣tall lyfe. Of ye which the doctrine of the gospell maketh vs to haue sure hope. Sens that we then were ones myserable / and by the onely aboundante mercy of god deleuered from synne now hope for the crowne of euerlasting lyfe we must haue pyty on other / and go aboute by all meanes that god also may haue mercye on theym.
Let a chrysten bysshop in stede of iewes fables tel these thynges to the people, for they be certeyne & without doubte. There remay∣neth nothyng more for vs to do / but yt in our liuing we may remē∣bre ye benefyte of god and lyue ac∣cordyng to his pleasure / or elles the professyon of chrystendome & the gospell wyll nothyng auayle vs. wherfore I wyl that yu assure all men of these thynges whiche greatly longe to the purpose & cō¦fyrm thē therin also / yt thei which ones haue beleued ī god / yt by his free mercifulnes they haue ben re¦demed fro theyr synnes / & that he will gyue ye croūe of euerlastyng life to all them which by vertuo{us} and godly lyuyng do study to fo∣low as nere as thei are able Iesu Chryst / yt they I say which haue this beleue so lede ouer theyr lyfe
that it maye seme accordynge to our professyō & not vnworthy so greate promyssys of god. Now they shall declare them selfe to be very christē men / not if they curse or say yll by ye gentyles & iewes / but yf they be beneficiall & gentle to all men / & by the affection that they haue to pyty / they reioyse to helpe euery body. For these thin∣ges shall not onely ornate & com∣mend ye professyon of the christen beleue / as thynges of theym selfe honest / but also {pro}fitable to draw other to Chryste & to helpe other whiche be oppressed with ony ca∣lamyte. The chefe poynt of chry∣stentye is to do good to all men / and by benefites wylde bestes be ouercome & made tame & gentle. Thou shalt therfore on this ma∣ner speke & preache of these thyn∣ges not makynge ony doubte as thei do which redacte all thinges
in to questyons and seme to haue nothyng perfyghtly to them as∣sured / but teache them wt greate confydence of countenaūce with greate stedfastnes of wordes / yt all men may well perceyue & vn∣derstonde that yu art well assured of that whiche thou doest labour to perswade to other men / yt oute of these cōmeth ye frute of vertuo{us} lyuynge. But folysshe and vncō∣nynge questyons and tangled or intrycate genealogyes and con∣tencyous or brawlyng dysputa∣tions or rather warre vpō Moy∣ses law / whiche some folowyng the trade of iewes styrre vp and moue to get them therby a name & aduaūtage / cast them away as superfluous & vnprofytable to ye liuyng after ye gospell. For what hurteth it to good lyuynge yf I know not / why Moyses graue can no where be found / whether
it be as ye iewes say that he shold be called vp agayne by magiciēs? How many yeres Matusale ly∣ued? what age Salamō was of, when he begat Roboam? why Moyses dyd forbed to eate the flesshe of swyne? why ye iewes do suppose that the blode of a wesell must with so greate care be pur∣ged / & other thynges they moue doubtes vpon, which be yet more folyshe then these. In the expoū∣dyng wherof what neadeth him to tary whiche hasteth to the re∣warde of good and vertuous ly∣uing. These thinges must rather be cut away then declared. And thei which professe them as excel∣lent thynges must be blamed and byd to holde theyr peace and not disputed with all. If thei erre by symplenes / when they are admo∣nysshed they wyll amend. But if they do amysse by stubberne and
obstacle malyce / for a name or lu∣cre or ony other foule cause / then wyll they be redye also to defend as well false thynges as trwe. Such men when thou hast ones or twyse rebuked them / yf they cease not / exchew theym as men faccyous and incurable / lest they maye do more, when they be pro∣uoked / then they wolde yf they were let alone as men not regar∣ded / yea & left to / by such eggyng and styrryng of theym▪ it myght come to daūger / that such which cānot be amended, might by dys∣putations when thei are {pro}uoked draw theyr admonytour into ye same errour. And what auaileth it to geue ony more medycynes when there is no longar hope of recouerynge. An errour cōmyng but onely by the fragilite of man, is remedyed by one or two war∣nynges but malyce is icurable,
and made wors, by putting to of ony remedyes. And therfore he yt beyng ones or twyse rebuked cō∣tine with neuertheles to bide stife in his opynyon / let hym alone in his froward mynde a man quite ouerturned and remedyles. Nor it neadeth not ye to labour to con∣dempne hym / sythen he is by his owne iudgement cōdempned. Yf he perische / he is lost & cast away by his owne faute. For he hathe no such bukler to hold afore him. I erred by ignorāce / no mā war∣ned me. For what can one do to a syk man / that wyll take no me∣dycyne / peraduēture yf he be des∣pysed & neglect / he wyll wex wy∣ser / yf he wyll not / yet the fewer that resorte to hym / ye fewer shall ye cōtagyousnes of his disease in∣fecte. I wold fayn haue you with me a few dayes. But I wold yt it sholde not be to the damages / of
ye christē congregations in Crete whiche haue ben but of late con∣uerted to ye trew fayth, and ther∣fore they haue the more neade of a diligent hed / which may builde vpon the fundations now layed. Se therfore that thou mete with me at Nycopole / but not afore yt I send either Artemas or Ticht∣cus thyder to be there for ye in my stede, lest thy deptyng sholde leue Crete destytute & as an Orphe∣line. Thou shalt not nede to feare that I wolde in ye meane tyme go any where els & so thou sholdest lese thy laboure / For I am pur∣posed all this next winter to be at Nycopole which is a citie of the cōtre of Thrace. whē zeno which was sōtyme a {pro}fessour of Moy∣ses law / & now a noble preacher of ye gospell. And Apollo whiche is a mā greatly aproued in ye do∣ctryne of Chryst wyll depart frō
thens bryng them forward with all the humanytye that maye be. And se they lak nothynge yt shall be necessarye for theyr iorney. Yf these offices of humanytie be do∣ne of the gentyles / that they will for good maners sake bring him forwarde yf he haue deserued it / and geue hym sufficiently at his de{per}tyng vitayles & other necesa∣ries to his iorney. I thȳke it very ryght that our men also / whiche knowlege them selfe to be christē men sholde lerne to vse suche gen∣tylnes / and to geue due thankes to them that haue well deserued them / not yt they sholde by theyr lyberalyte make them ryche / but yt they gyue them suche thynges as be necessarye for theyr liuyng, when nede shall be. For it is not conuenyent yt sythen they whiche be alyenat from Chryste / be yet taught of nature to geue thākes
to them of whome they haue ben holpen with ony benefite: christē men sholde be baren and vnfrut∣full to them of whome they haue receiued ony good turne. As ma∣ny as be here with me cōmende them to the. Do thou againe cō∣mēd me there to as many as loue me not with no worldly affectiō, but with euangelycall & chrysten charyte / whiche the cōmune pro∣fessyon of fayth doth gēdre in vs. The fre benefycēce of goodnes of god be alwayes wt vs all. Amen. Thus endeth the paraphrase of Erasmus, vpō Paule vnto Tyte, Imprented by Iohn̄ Byddell in London in Fletestrete next to the Flete Brydge Translated by Leonard Cox.
