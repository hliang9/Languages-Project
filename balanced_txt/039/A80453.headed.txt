A Copy of a LETTER Concerning the ELECTION OF A Lord Protector. Written to a Member of Parliament. LONDON, Printed by Tho. Newcomb, neer Baynards-Castle in Thames-street, 1654.
SIR, YOu may please to remember, that upon some late discourses which passed between us concerning some things relating to the present esta∣blishment in our Government, and of that question of Hereditary or Elective succession; I did then trou∣ble you with the relation of my o∣pinion therein, and give you such reasons and arguments as did then occur, for the establish∣ment of both: And which might serve by way of answer to those ordinary objections made to the contrary, which in malicious Pamphlets or otherwise were vulgarly spread a∣broad, both to disaffect the people, and to breed a distaste and jealousie both in Parliament and Army against the Pro∣tector and his settlement and proceedings. But having now since had time more seriously to consider of the nature and consequences of the thing, both as it is in it self, and as it doth relate to the constitution of these Nations, and the present state of publique affairs therein setled. I found my self on all hands so throughly satisfied with the inconveni∣encies that would accompany Election, and with the falla∣cies of all those specious arguments usually given for it, that I conceived it lay upon me as a duty, as well for your own farther satisfaction, as for that satisfaction you might here∣in give to others, both in the House and Army, to give un∣to you a more full and regular accompt of my conceptions herein: To the end that the prejudices of all unbiassed peo∣ple may be herewith so far satisfied, that through murmure and ingratitude we do not again provoke God to desist in that course of establishment he hath now put us, and suffer us again to relapse into our former way of division and dis∣order; whilst, at once, we should shew our selves as well unjust and ingrateful towards him, as towards that his Mi∣nister whom he hath made so highly instrumental in so great a mercy.
So far as this design of Election savours of injustice and ingratitude towards our present Superior, I shall desire you (Sir) first to consider, that as ambition and covetousness are vices to all men more or less incident, so in those or such like alterations of State as have happened to us, it cannot be ex∣pected that the acquisitions of the prevailing party, either for honour or riches, can be so equally or in such sort shared as to find general satisfaction. For as each one is then ready to set the highest rate he can on his own deserts and endea∣vours in the Commou cause, even so must he consequently as much repine at the portions of others above him, and which are greater then his own, as to be thereby prompted to find out and promote all the ways he can both for abating from them, and for reducing them to an equality with himself: And if this cannot be effected, then at least to abridge them of continuance herein, that he also, as in right of election, may have his turn in those honours and estates which are highest. And this is also to be expected from such as have for a long time together made to them∣selves a way of trade and gain by means of that supreme and uncontrollable power and trust they then executed: when now being debarred of the perpetuity of their misused power, they are busie to vent abroad their angry and re∣vengeful declamations as well against his power that hath done it, as his continuance therein; and to make it take the better, to palliate it with the shew of publike good. They say, that since all in the late engagement have run equal hazard, and have jointly adventured their lives and fortunes, why should any one person or family be suffered to ingross all the prize to themselves? That the Cause they undertook was that which was common, and for the good of the whole people, and to render them happy not the single advantage and preferment of any one man or his po∣sterity. And if any one man should claim advantage or pre∣ferment above the rest, as having been (for his part) most eminent and active in th prosecution and danger thereof, yet why his son or posterity, who (perhaps) were not all,
or very little meritorious therein? Will not the same justice and reason of eminent desert that preferred the Father to others of less desert then him, claim precedence for other persons of more present deserts and hopes before these also? Mark the dispensations of Providence and Nature; since they entail not Vertue and Wisdom to a Family, what is it but on purpose to advise us to a discreet liberty of choosing him that is best out of all, and not servilely to subject our selves to such hazards and inconveniences as may accom∣pany any one? In such sort as sometimes a person notori∣ously wicked, and sometimes (to the heightening of our woe) a Child shall be left to rule over us. That it is the strongest allurement to undertake acts of Tyrannie and In∣justice; since now they know they cannot be amoved, be they what they will: Nor will they at all study the content and satisfaction of the people, since they know they came in, and can continue therein without them. Whereas he that considers that his election comes from, and is made by the people, will probably, as in gratitude and kindness to them, study all ways to please and oblige them With these and such like discourses and arguments I find the ambitious heads of some persons (disaffected to the present Government, or indeed to any Government at all) have of late sought, not only to estrange the minde of both Parliament and Army one towards another, but to spread an universall jealousie and disgust against him that is now our higher Power: That so as under the odium and suspition of that arbitrary Government which may be acted by one person, themselves may, more certainly, and in grea∣ter numbers, both at Committees and elswhere, by vertue of the glorious title and countenance of a Parlament, stil retain to themselves an unlimited power to settle and dispose of the Liberties and fortunes of others as they shall see good. And although, for the present there may not be so much fear of impression upon a just consideration of the appro∣ved moderation and discipline of the whole Army (the like whereunto I may confidently say no story can make in∣stance
in) yet, considering them as mortal in their particu∣lar members, and how that hereafter the hope of succession (a contrivance purposely brought in to engage and disaffect some of them) may work upon more ambitious and cove∣tous heads, I have thought good to offer these Considera∣tions following, as highly considerable, both in respect of Justice and gratitude to the person now in possession, and also in reference to the future good and tranquility of the three Nations. First, I say, that in this great change in the face of pub∣lick affairs which hath hapned and been brought about, all that have been active have not run equal hazards. For, as it is apparent that the Souldier hath run more hazard then others; so, amongst them again, although it be true, that as to the shock of a battail, the common Souldier is in equal or greater peril of his life, then his Captain or Colonell, yet since in the defeat of an Army, it is much the lesser part that perish in the field; but the rest coming to be made pri∣soners, and so left to the usage of the Conqueror, it is not then to be thought but that the leader and Commander is more in danger of severe and exemplary punishment then the other. Besides which, in all Proclamations of pardon, which are the usuall fore-runners of open warr or sett battailes, an offer of indemnity and grace useth to be made as to the body and ordinary sort of the adverse party and army, and onely some few, and it may be but the Generall himself to stand excepted. And therefore I would desire those that be now Commanders in this present army to lay these things to heart, and to measure the case of their present Generall by that Gospel rule of doe as thou wouldest be done unto. Doe they not really believe that in case the King had prevailed, themselves should have undergone higher Censure and Punishment then those of inferior ranke that served under them? and that, not onely as having greater fortunes then them to lose, but also as having been more eminent and active against him then they. And doe they not farther believe that their present Generall, as
having most of all been eminent and forward in this whole enterprise, was not thereupon, proportionably in greatest danger of all? Therefore if they think it reasonable that those states and honours which by means, and as in reward of their publique imployment are come into their hands, should now remain as hereditary to their posterity, in like manner as they did to others before, they must, upon the same rule of equity determine that the like is most justly due to the Protector & his family also. If any of them by means of his own military and publick imployment, have encreased his estate or degree so far as to be brought up to the rank and title of Esquire, will he be content that nothing of this shall descend to his sonne? Or if he have gotten the propriety of some Mannor, and through that the jurisdiction and Honour which belongs to a Lord thereof, will they be content to exercise and enjoy al this but during life onely, and then suffer both the acquired estate and Lordship to rest at the dispose of the Tenants, or those that have served under him? whereby these, as renouncing that their own former and proper relations and conditions of Tenancy and Obedience, should now take upon them to dispose, as they think good of the heir; and to share and distribute, as they please, all that belonged to the Father? And all this upon allegation it was a joynt and publike cause which they all undertooke, and that these honours and Revenews being parcels of, and belonging unto that Com∣monwealth, for which they served, there was no reason that one should engross and appropriate that for which all had run like hazard and service: If, they think this Levelling plea fit in this case to take place, there will then indeed be some equality though little discretion. But if they on their parts, like not to be reduced to this condition, but do rather judge it reasonable that since that Commonwealth, for whose sake and safety they have undertaken all this pains and hazard, hath belonging unto it, and to the necessary support and management thereof divers hereditary Offi∣cers, preferments, and Revenues, it is but just that those
persons that have been most eminently faithful and active above others in the support of it and them, should by good equity be estated in those places and powers which are of greatest trust and benefit. For if this plea be not good, there are examples and presidents enow to be fetched out of for∣reign parts both for levelling of Gentry and Nobility, and also to make them mortal with the parent, and to depend on the arbitrary disposal of others. But if they would not, for their parts, have it well taken to have alterations pur∣posely devised and set on foot to take from them and theirs what they had so highly deserved, so can they not but judge it as hard and unequal usage towards others. For, did any of them ever hear or read that the Soveraignty of this place was ever elective? If not, doe they indeed think that this man that now hath it, is, for his part, so much the worst and most undeserving of any that ever yet ruled, that, for his exemplary infamy and disgrace, a particular law must be brought in to the prejudice of his posterity? I would fain demand of any of them that are fathers of children; Was not the honor & advancement of their house one great mo∣tive to this undertaking? Did they not beforehand know, that if they had been overcome, the infamy and loss accom∣panying Traitors and Treason (ever imputed to the weaker side) would have light on their posterity as much or more then themselves? And therefore since these their children (especially of such as have been eminent) have run their shares in the hazard of that shame and loss which did attend the success, and the greatest share too in the perpetuity thereof; they cannot therefore but conclude, that not only their own, but the race of those also that are above them, must, by good right, claim to be estated and setled in all such hereditary Offices as their father stood seised of, in reward or acknowledgment of their past service. There can be no man so weak of judgment or experience, but may easily conceive there would have been a more high measure of contempt and punishment inflicted on the posterity of the Protector then of any other, in case he had been overcome:
Nor surely can any be so devoid of reason or conscience, as not to determine that by good consequence they doe there∣upon deserve also to be continued in the highest preferment that doth belong to that Commonwealth whose cause they maintained, and for whose safety they were put into such hazard. But to come yet neater to them in their Proposals for Equality: Do they think fit indeed, that every person and every family engaged in this Cause, should enjoy an arith∣metical proportion of power and advantage with that of their superiors, both in electing and being elected? Why, then must the poorest Cottager and Mechanick of all come in with their equal voice to choose, and also with his equal turn for being chosen, without any put-off for want of birth or breeding, or other personal endowment or fitting quali∣fication which was not at his hand to be expected But if they cannot think it possible that this way could afford turns e∣now for the hundreth family in a Kingdom that have en∣gaged; nor do think it farther necessary to erect an Heralds Office to register all that first ventured and acted in that Cause, with their several discents and pedigrees; then do they proceed partially according to their own rule, making an unequal choice amongst those that have equally en∣gaged: Because equality of honor and preferment being due to that first equality of desert, and engagement in the Father only, how can it be forfeited by any accidentall in∣feriority or impediment in the Son hapning since? Will they wave this supposition of equall engagement and claim due unto all Families, and confine both the Electors and E∣lected unto some rank or order of men, and so by an exact pair of Sizers cut a Nation into two equalities; one that shall be equally and altogether uncapable of having voice or share in the Government, and the other of being con∣stantly and equally capable of both (as in all elective Mo∣narchies is practised) then by the same rule of justice that they observe a distance, and exclude those below from ha∣ving an equality with them in some places of command or
profit; he that is uppermost of all, may, as I said, exclude them again in that which is highest. For it may well be presumed, that he is as much above them of the highest rank of equality, as they again are above those that are below. If we look to the examples of Germany and Poland (the two onely places where there is a soveraign Magistrate ele∣cted with any competent power) we shall find that Germany hath scarcely made any choice but out of their four great Families of Franconia, Swevia, Bavaria, and Austria, still making choice of one of those Dukes for Emperor; which they did not neither, till there was a failer in the family of Charls the Great, which was above them all. And as for Poland, their Stories tell us, That they have had Forty per∣sons successively Raigning of one and the same Family: the like whereunto cannot be said of any hereditary Monarchy that I know of. And, Sir if you would be satisfied with presidents as well as Reason, for this hereditary succession amongst our selves, you shall finde it adjusted even from the Founders and Ori∣ginals of our English Nation. For did not those Armies of the Saxons that had holpen the people of this Land against their Enemies, think it afterwards reasonable, that since themselves had shared in most of the great places of Trust and Command, and that also in the same way of approbation and hereditary right they found them possest by others before, so also to settle their Generals and their Heires in that place and degree of power which was highest of all? and this they did, although in their own Nation that Office did then pass by Election. And it will be also found that both Dane and Norman coming with their Ar∣mies afterwards, did, upon their success, settle themselves and their Chieftains in like manner. If we look abroad we shall finde, Sir, that as these Saxons did in England, so the Francks (another people of Germany) did also settle their Leaders in the Kingdom of France, and although they had called themselves Francks, as impatient of the subjection of any other, yet did they most willingly
submit to the Head of their own party. And mark those severall lines of Kings that have therein swayed, and you will finde that the severall Families of Meroveus, Charles the Great, and of Capet, were such as by their own policy and prowess, and by the help of a powerfull party had bin advanced from the degree of Subjects to become absolute Kings, upon the expulsion of those that were their former Masters, and had the Title. Nay, look to Italy, Spain. France, Germany, Poland, Hungary, and all the world over, and you shall still finde, that in all those State-alterations that have been made by a prevailing party, either domestick or foraign, the Head and Leader of that party hath still had the Diademe, or chief place of Authority setled on him and his Family. Neither Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Huns, or any people whatever but acted accordingly: and how∣ever they were Nations most fond of the name of Liberty, as it is observed that all Northern people are, and might al∣so be otherwise governed at home; yet, in this case, they still held it equitable, that since themselves had every one. by the conduct of their Chieftain, bettered his Fortunes, in possession of the Inheritances of persons of inferior Ranks, so proportionally should their Generall be fetled in that which was highest. And as the examples of Republicks, or of elective Monarchies have been few, and also inconside∣rable, either for eminence or durance, in comparison of Mo∣narchies, and those hereditary (which in most places hath always so continued without alteration, whereas no one place that hath been Republick or Elective, but what hath been longer and more eminent otherways) so is it farther observable, That when Greeks, Romans Germans, Poles, or any other have erected Commonwealths, or made their Princes elective, it hath never been done after a Civill con∣test, and where one party hath gotten the better of the other by way of conquest, but was still done in peace, and by an unanimous consent of the whole Nation, and when there was no alteration of private mens Fortunes and con∣ditions; and where also there was a failer in the Line of
their last conquering Prince: at which time it is not to be supposed, that the Nobles or Senators would in their parity one to another, be content to submit to the constant Regi∣ment of any third person and family amongst themselves. For so in Greece they set up their Commonwealths, when the Heraclidae, (that race of Kings amongst them that de∣scended from their famous Warrior and defender Hercules) became extinct. And so they did in Germany and Poland, upon failer of the Lines of Charlemain and Lechus. Or else (as in Rome) where the whole people did joyn in that discontent, and in seclusion of their Kings, and had no pre∣cedent Civill war thereabouts, or about the exercise of the Civill power. For had it so been, that side that had under a Cesar been victorious, and thereupon seated themselves and families in the honors and possessions of the adverse party, would certainly, in honor and gratitude, have made him and his issue Imperatores in the Civill State, who had all that while been Imperatores in the Field. And if we look to our Neighbors of the Low-Countries (a People that our Nation hath no reason to reckon as gratefull to their Protectors) yet we shall finde that they having in their U∣nion against their King the King of Spain, been victorious through the conduct and assistance of the Prince of Orange, have thereupon confirmed unto the same Family the chief Office of Honor and Command heretofore executed among them: Under which, as they have hitherto thriven, so is it highly probable that the seclusion thereof, may prove the seclusion of all farther peace and happiness from that people, And now, Sir, after all this travail in foraign Stories, to return home, and home to your self too, let me appeal to you as a Member of a Parlament of England; Did you ever read of any Parlament that did not settle the Govern∣ment on the posterity of him that was possessed, and whose Writs they obeyed in their Summons? And therefore, Sir, since there is no competent example to be fetched herein out of any foraign Story, and since no one sort of people at
any time inhabiting or possessing this Land, did ever in any age attempt to make this Government elective; such a thing to be at this time attempted, and towards such an one that hath in particular so well deserved, will seem a thing most of all unreasonable, as well as ungrateful. When I have said so much to you (Sir) on the behalf of the General, to serve as an Anti-Memento against the in∣sinuations of such as would have the Army believe that the power and settlement of him and his family would prove an unsetling of them: I shall now on the contrary desire you to consider how the establishment of this one person and his family will be, under God, the most necessary and likely way to draw on their securities also; and that, even from the aforesaid arguments of most prime and principal en∣gagement of the same cause. For since he and his have herein already so far adventured, as to be most of all un∣capable of reconcilement and forgiveness, they may then be most sure that both he and his in order to their own de∣fence and security, (which is no way else to be had but by the steady assistance of the Army) will be most intent and studious of all and every one of their several preferments and good wills, in such sort as not to make any the least alteration amongst them without necessary and just cause. Whereas another person or family that may hereafter be elected, and it may be contrary to their interest and liking, cannot be presumed to carry so ready and great a respect towards them and theirs, as experience doth warrant this man to have done. For if the power of election shall rest in such men as are not members of the Army, it is then likely, out of that enmity which usually passeth towards martial men, from such as are not of like quality or descent, all their former services may come to be forgotten, and themselves put off with contempt, as being now of no further use. And farther, it may be such an one shall be chosen as hath not been at all, or very little active in the same Cause with them; in which case their danger will also increase through that greater likelihood of his compliance
with the adverse party: For how easie a matter may it be for such an one to be taken into favor there, and for some eminent breach of trust have such high dignity and reward promised and setled upon him and his, as may by far coun∣tervail that momentany title which he now holdeth? The which can never be feared from him that is of the same qua∣lity and engagement with themselves, and that is hereditari∣ly fixed in this place; who being at the height already, and so setled, nothing can be offered him valuable to his resignati∣on. And having so far spoken of these things as they carry a more particular concern to the Army, in answer to those that would disaffect them from their own General; I shall now answer those arguments whereby they endeavour to disaffect the whole Nation against the present Settlement, under the pretence of the good of the Common∣wealth. You are hereupon, Sir, desired to consider, That when you discover in any men more then ordinary pretensions of zeal to the publique good, and for advancement of the Li∣berties of the people; and, on the contrary, as strong inve∣ctives against Tyranny and Arbitrary government; and do withall finde them offering and giving in strange proposals for the establishment of the one, and the prevention of the other, you may then, I say, be sure that that party from whom all this proceeds is such an one as mislikes his present condition; and, for the amendment of his fortune; doth either expect to be bribed by preferment from making any disturbance; or else he hopes, that, from the new shuffling of affairs in the alteration of State, he may have a better game dealt him then before. In the mean time all modest and judicious men doe look upon mankinde under Govern∣ment, as in all other his worldly conditions, still subject and liable to many mischiefs and inconveniences. And there∣fore although each sort of setled Government carry with it self a certain benefit, even as Government; and that Monarchy and hereditary Monarchy, as the most setled form, is most preferrible to the rest, in respect of Divine
appointment and institution, and of politicall practise and accommodation; yet to suppose that any thing, submitted to the managery and accidents of humane frailty, can be thereupon found otherwise then liable to adverse accidents, beyond the cure of any mortall contrivance, will (as I said) argue an ambitious arrogance in the proposer, and also a credulous folly in the receiver. Besides, when I finde God both punishing and threatning to punish people by sending such Princes as they deserve, what doth this invention of Election but look like a contrivance to defeat the decrees of Heaven in either of those ways of punishment, by a Childe or an evil Prince? and what doe they deserve, that take this course either in distrust of Gods providence, or in prevention of their own punishment, but to finde a remedy worse then the disease, and to be liable to certain evils, to avoid contingent ones? For, let us suppose our selves even in the worst of these chances, either faln under an evill or a childish heir, and yet we shall herein finde it equall with that which is Elective. For, first, if a Childe be left to succeed, then is it perfectly in the same condition; because of that person who is elected to rule in his stead, as his Pro∣tector and guardian. And this apparent advantage is then also usually found, that being done by the Father, who had more interest in the good of the publique then any other, is not only done without danger of Civill war, but with due and unbyassed respect to the sufficiency of the person. In which case also the highest person and nearest of blood, is commonly chosen. Whereupon, by reason of his native high quality, the Subjects pay their obedience more readily then they would to a new raised person: And then, he and his Family having greater and more certain interest in the Commonwealth then any other, will, in that respect, be more careful to advance the good thereof then any other also. As for that inconvenience, That a wicked Son may be heir to the Crown, and so leave a Kingdom necessarily subjected to such a Ruler; whereas in elective Monarchies
there is a liberty to choose the most vertuous and fit per∣son out of any family: It might be hereunto first answered, that in case of apparent unfitness in the elder, the Father (who can better judge thereof then others) will doubtless leave the Kingdom to some other son more fit, or else ap∣point such as Tutors and Guides over him, that his Kingdom and Family (things to be supposed of more concern to him then any else) shall not be hazarded by any of his vices or indiscretion: and there are not wanting presidents of this kind. But, to affirm that this course of Election is hereby made a constant way of prevention of all those mischiefs that may come from the hands of evil Governors, is a beg∣ing of the question, upon these and like suppositions. As first, That each person hath his abilities, inclinations, and moral habits so apparent, as not to endanger those that are to make use of him, through dissimulation. The next is, that all and each one of the Electors (to make it a free and discreet choice) are not only endued with an infallibility for the discovery of good and bad in the general, but also can distinguish and choose according to such particular ver∣tuous habits as are most fit for him that is to execute the place of Governor in chief; and this as knowingly as the Carpenter can by sight tell the nature and kind of that wood he is to make use of. Next, and beyond this again, it must be presumed that, besides this knowledge, there must be in all and each of the Electors so much conscience and integrity adjoined, as to cause them constantly to choose each person for publike regard sake only, and not according to any particular relation, or private liking or interest. Now since upon the failing of any one of these surmises, it is apparent that the constancie of their promised benefit must fail also, so much more upon the failing and uncertainty of all of them, (as is most evident they doe) there can nothing of certainty be expected from this their promised benefit, as every man in his own judgment may presently conclude. For first, there is nothing that fals out more common within our notice, then the daily practice of
the art of dissimulation; even so, that those that have high∣est design and intention to gain to themselves any advan∣tage by the over-reaching of others, are thereby also ren∣dred the most studious and able proficients therein, and this most especially where ambition bears sway; for as then the aim is higher, so is this humor usually incident to persons of more then ordinary abilities: The which cannot again but tell them, that as all men do submit to Government but as out of necessity, and that since we cannot absolutely avoid the being under the government of some, and so conse∣quently of being sometimes and in some things restrained of our wils, (to the end that others that would else in this time of general liberty injure us, may thereupon be restrain∣ed also) it comes therefore to pass that those that are most desirous and like to prevail in the obtaining of places of su∣preme power and command, do, for acceptance and general approbation sake, frame their outward behaviour in com∣pliance to this humour: They not only put on a face of sobriety, meekness and clemencie, whereby vulgarly to please, but more particularly to ingratiate with the Electors themselves, (who they know would have been absolutely governing still, had it not been for the fear of others) They make semblance to each party and person amongst them of a great sympathie and liking they have to them in their several wayes and opinions, in such sort as in effect to perswade them, that to choose him to be their chief Ruler, is but the same as to rule in chief themselves by his means. Even as Marius and Silla, as they severally thought them most powerful to set them up in supreme authority, so did they severally court and comply with the humors of the people or Nobility; and during the time that the more popular part did bear sway, some in that state, the better to ingratiate themselves and obtain their election, have re∣nounced their noble birth and quality, and caused them∣selves to be adopted by some inferior person. So that, in a word, as every man is to the world a dissembler in respect of his inward inclinations and faults, so from men of the
highest aims are practises of this kind to be most expected. Whereupon it must fall out that he that can (Tiberius-like) most dissemble, shall be most sure of this honour: From whence it comes to pass, that it is ordinarily a peoples hap∣piness to be deceived in the qualities of the party. For the vulgar sort choosing according to meekness and softness of spirit only, are ready to conclude, that he governs all best, that governs all least: whereas the Electors again, being di∣vided by factions amongst themselvs, would have their oppo∣sites to be by him governed too much, and themselves not at all. Whereupon it will appear, that this fancied benefit leaves us but at as great or greater uncertainty then we were be∣fore; until they can prove that the art of dissimulation and the art of Regiment proceed from the same ability, and do always accompany one another in the same person. And if we look to our own Story, it was certainly a happiness to those that then lived, that by the right of descent they stood obliged to accept of Henry the fifth; one that neither for his vertuous life, or any other apparent behaviour, was so likely else to have been elected, as was Henry the sixth his son, being a Prince of more meek and pious behaviour. So hard a thing it is to discover and distinguish between those endowments and vertues, which are most proper to com∣pleat a good man and a good Prince. For he that is most accomplished in his Ethicks, may be as far to seek in his Politicks. Of which we have yet a more fresh instance in the persons and reigns of Richard the 3. and that of our late King Charls. When were the people in greater fear of se∣vere usage, then at the entrance of the one; or did express greater joy and expectation, then at the entrance of the other? insomuch as I believe that there is scarce any one even of those that have most opposed him, but had he been then free to choose, would have given his voice for him. And yet it hath pleased God so far to deceive humane judg∣ment and expectation, as to cause these Nations to undergo the greatest share of Civil calamities and changes in the time of this last: whereas in the time of the other the peo∣ple
enjoyed a continual security and quiet; and during that shorter time he did reign, there were yet more good laws made then in the reign of any Prince besides Nay, I think I may boldly say, that upon the examination of our own Chronicles, or any else, it will be found that those persons that people have received or elected as their greatest dar∣lings, have in their governments proved to them most fatal; and, on the contrary, such as they have been most afraid of, and have submitted unto only as out of sense of duty, have proved most fortunate: As it were on purpose to instruct and advise us, that the most high God and disposer of Kings and Kingdoms, will, as he sees good, make them instrumen∣tal for infliction of his wrath, or of his blessing to any peo∣ple; and, by that usual deception of ours, in the judging of such as be either good or bad, doth thereby teach us, neither to trust in these things to the arm of flesh and our own judgment and contrivances, nor to cast so much distrust to∣wards him and his care of us, as to refuse those persons he hath by his providence, and usual way of dispensation in that kind, set over us. For as he did never set up any government but Monarchy, nor did ever give that, or any setled office to any person, but he did withall give it to his posterity; so is it to be left to him alone to find out the means to change the same from family to family, as he shall really know the deserts both of the one and the other; and not leave it to us to contrive and set up elective Monarchies upon any such fond suppositions. For if such a consideration had been valuable to have made places of supreme trust and power elective, then certainly the High-Priesthood, re∣quiring far more personal execution, and that in more divine affairs then that of King, (who was the first established Officer in Civil affairs) should not also have been entailed to a single family. In which kind notwithstanding it was still setled, and so to continue, till God by himself or by his Vicegerent saw just cause for alteration thereof. In which case as there were others ready still to supply those defects which childhood or other insufficiencie might occasionally
make in the high Priesthood, so may there be in the Civil Magistracie also, without running into danger of civil war through the abdication of a family of known desert, and still be but at the same hazard for goodness or sufficiencie in the choice of another. If we appeal from discourse and argument to matter of experience and practice, in this question of the benefit of Election, we shall also find things to fall out quite contrary to their imagination and promises; and that, upon exami∣nation of foreign stories, and comparing the vertues and good government of such as have ruled in places elective, with the vertues and good rule of such as reigned in places hereditary; we shall truly find the people in a much happier condition under the last then under the first. For where shall we pick out any instance for a succession of Princes, so notoriously wicked, and in so great a number, as was in the Roman Empire after the Souldiery and Senate would there take upon them to make that Government elective, and neglect that more direct line of succession and that he∣reditary right which belonged to the issue of their brave and victorious Chieftain Caesar? What think we of Cali∣gula, Nero, Otho, Vitellius, Caracalla, Heliogabalus, and other unmatchable examples both for ill life and ill go∣vernment? And when we have pitcht upon the best of them, it will not be any encouraging example for Christians to set up their Governor by election, since on their score we may justly lay the greatest part of those most bloody persecuti∣ons made against them: which until the time of Constantine the Great, who, with his Christianity, did again establish an hereditary succession, and so somewhat more increase and settle the glory of that Empire, the poor Christians found little joy or intermission. So easie and usual a thing it is for dissimulation, force or bribery to prevail in this kind. And if you will imploy your thoughts upon the collecti∣on of such Princes as have been highly illustrious and emi∣nent, either in sacred or prophane story, I do not think you will find any one that came in by election only, (in sacred
story I am sure you will not) that deserves to be put either in the first or second rate. No, those Princes that were so glorious in conquests as to establish the three first Monar∣chies of the world, were all of them such as were heredi∣tary: Nay, that which we call the fourth Monarchy, (be∣cause it was longest a Monarchy, and under that govern∣ment it was longest, and had under it both rise and perfe∣ction, being from the Creation but 480 years a Common-wealth) doth owe unto hereditary Monarchy its chief and fundamental laws, and also that warlike discipline by means whereof it became so great and victorious afterwards. For all which, Sir, there is a reason at hand: Even because the foundation and atchievement of greatness and empire, re∣quiring a foregoing design and councel, and that which is made upon experience also; and requiring a foregoing stock of Treasure, Navy, and other warlike ammunition and preparations, together with a well disciplined and obe∣dient Amry: & lastly, requiring a good proportion of time for the prosecution and finishing thereof, it is not to be sup∣posed that the life of any one person can be sufficient both to continue and perfect things of such length and difficulty: but rather, upon these considerations, it is to be conceived that every elective Prince will be discouraged from such attempts; not only because of danger and hardship, but also because he shall venture and labour for what shall not accrue to his family, and it may be that the glory and profit of all his works may come to be enjoyed by such a successor as is his enemy. And so again, in case any such enterprise should have been set on foot, it is as vain a thing to suppose that the emulation that doth usually attend Princes of this condition (and those that are best of them too) will let the successor contribute towards the accomplishment of any work begun by another, but rather to contrive one of his own, and that contrary also, to the increase of his own glory by the others disgrace. So that it being probable that his predecessor was not allied to him, but of another party or faction, those that were Enemies to the other are but so
much the more likely to expect favour and protection, in stead of war and conquest from him. And it is farther con∣siderable, that it will also require a good space of time for every new elected Prince to understand the state of his own affairs; and both to settle them, and secure himself against those of other parties and factions which he mistrusts, and have opposed him at home, before he can have time and opportunity to think of, and make provision for conquests abroad, (which then also must be supposed the more short, for that Princes are not elected young.) So that we are then only to expect such glorious and great acts to be at∣chieved by any one such person as a Solomon or an Alexan∣der, when they have succeeded as heirs to a David or a Philip; who, as well in love and care to their Kingdoms, as to their posterity that shall enjoy them, have been so provident and industrious in laying up all sort of provisi∣ons, and making such preparations and beginnings as are unto the accomplishment of so great works necessary. And it is very observable, that when God hath any great and glorious act or change to make in the world, or in any one Nation, he doth then also not only raise up a new fa∣mily, like those of Caesar and Pepin, (for the greater mani∣festation of his power and appearance) but doth also bless the same with an Augustus or a Charlemain; such a fa∣mous heir and successor, as may serve for compleating and finishing the work: To the end that all the glory might not be appropriate to one neither. In which consideration, Sir, why may we not presume that as our present Protector hath been by his power and presence set up and made pro∣sperous for some great and glorious end (of which we have seen prudent foundations already laid,) so also that the full perfection and settlement of the work is to be ex∣pected from his heir. And more apparent hope may we have hereof also, then could at first be conceived of Henry the 5. lately mentioned; who yet succeeding a father, the first of his family, and raised by the sword, did make so good use of that establishment and those preparations he had
made at home, that, to the great honor of this Nation, he became the most renowned Prince of any before or since. Where it is objected, Sir, that hereditary soveraignty renders men more inclined to acts of tyranny and oppressi∣on, because he is not in fear to be called to accompt: It may be answered, that he that fears to be called to accompt, will be by so much the more provoked to destroy and op∣press those that he thinks will be most instrumental therin. For, Tyrannie being nothing else but Soveraign revenge upon such as may or have opposed and crossed them; and Subjects being to be presumed more ready and daring in that kind against him that was but lately their fellow, and whose anger they fear not (because of that accompt he is to make) then against him that is their Prince born, who there∣upon is not so likely to conceive cause of hatred, and so to proceed to acts of tyrannie. Besides, from the very act of Election it self, there must be cause of discontent and re∣venge administred to such like Princes, and that, from all such as have not been of his party, or have opposed, or not so strongly abetted his claim as he saw fit. Which provo∣cations can never happen to the other; who, as in heredi∣tary right, comes in without any such opposition. And it is also to be considered, that a Prince elected for term of life is as little in fear of being called to accompt as the other, if he be a Soveraign Prince: if not, he is (as I said) for that reason most like to tyrannise and oppress. And we shall therefore find Tyrannie to be most cryed out upon by the people under Elective governments, and Insurrection and Civil war oftenest raised upon that score. And lastly, whereas it is affirmed, that Princes elected, will, as in requital of that courtesie, be more kind and lo∣ving to the people then such as are hereditary; for that these, on the other side, may seem more neglectful of them, as claiming their admittance of right, and not of favour: It may be answered, that this very thing (if well considered) is also an inconvenience which follows Election. For, unless
they can suppose that any Kingdom hath but one person fit or ambitious enough to stand for this choice, they must then next suppose, that the party chosen will be so far from being kind or grateful to such as were not of his party and did not joyn in his election, as he will be their enemy. Again it may be asked where they find these elections ever referred to the people in general, so as to induce him to kindness and acknowledgment towards them, and not still referred to some few certain Electors, as in Germany to six, nor but to a few in Poland, the Commons in both places being wholly excluded? Whereupon when the number of dissenting E∣lectors shall be taken out of the roll of kindness, it may well on the other side be concluded, that Election doth prompt Princes to be careless of the good of their people in general. and to carry so partial a respect towards some few friends and favorites that have holpen him to his soveraignty, and can continue him still in power, as to neglect and despise all the rest. So that equal justice being not to be expected from him in his publique administrations, it were much better for a Prince to think he holds his power from and under God, and is to him alone accomptable, then by such like devises to bribe or terrifie him that is to execute the place of a Judge, and so lay a stumbling block for him that reproveth in the gate. By this time, Sir, I hope I have made good what I affirm∣ed in the beginning, That all their arguments were but the insinuations of ambitious and factious heads, clouded under the specious shews of publique good and equal justice. For it plainly appears, that instead of avoidance (as they pre∣tend) their Proposals would necessarily bring us into sla∣very and oppression, by making our Princes (as of course) partial, unjust, and tyrannical. If they be then to seek in what they most rely upon, what will they answer to those more great and more certain miseries which are so constant∣ly attendant on the other form? all of which are so neces∣sarily leading to faction and siding, and to the unsetling of all estates and conditions, that no man regardful of publique
peace and content, and careful to avoid the danger of Civil war, Anarchy and confusion, can deliberately carry a wish that way. For since there cannot be any Political Govern∣ment (longer then there is an apparent Soveraignty some∣where abiding; from whose residence in one, few, or more persons, it comes to be called of this or that form; what shall we say of this Government, upon the death of the last elected Prince? If the supreme power be in the Electors, then is it now an Aristocracie: And why is it not to be feared that they may not proceed to election at all; but, by a kind of complot, keep it in their own hands? To think of setting up some other person or order to see them ob∣serve due time and method herein, is again to suppose the soveraignty not in them neither: for if they may be hindred from doing ill, so also from doing well, or not doing at all. And then how could the deceased Prince have soveraign power derived from his election, (supposing they gave it to him during life) if not they, but some others then had it? If, according to the sancied way of Coordination, the So∣veraignty were partly in the Electors, and partly in the Third Order, then must both agree in the election, or else it will come to nothing. And this they will doubtless do in case they be friends and of one interest and opinion, or else are afraid of each others power. In which case, as Coordi∣nation will at best prove fruitless, because they are as like to comply in an ill choice as a good, so again, if they be ene∣mies, that Commonwealth must run these two most certain perils, not only, through their contention, to be deprived of a good choice, when it is made; but be drawn into the most dangerous condition of Civil war, as being wholly engaged in two contraty parties. For, do greatness & soveraign power use to be slighted and unregarded, as that those that have it should be more ready to resign then increase it? Do men rather chuse subjection, then principality; to be in the con∣dition of beggers for favors, then be able to do them? Have we not seen a Parliament designing to make themselvs ever∣lasting? and may we not hereafter fear that a Councel may
doe so too? And therefore it must needs be, that upon the death of every Elected Prince, the whole State and Go∣vernment, and every mans fortune therein, must be left in tottering condition; whilst (during that inter-regnum) Eve∣ry man may doe what seems good in his own eyes, and so be as in a state of Anarchy. The which unhappy condition we finde attributed to the Israelites before they had the Scepter hereditarily setled (as was promised) in the Tribe of Judah, but were subject to the like Chasmes in government. And if any would know how it can be imagined that every man could be permitted to doe what was right in his own eyes, or be in a state of Anarchy, where there is a standing Law for direction what to doe, and standing Judges and Officers to see it done; and where, lastly, there is a stand∣ing high Court or Councell above all. So that the Israe∣lites having at that time all these, that is, the Law of Mo∣ses, the Priests and Levites, and other ordinary Judges; and having also their Sanhedrim or great Councell of Elders, and prime men of their Tribes, we must therefore conceive that by every mans doing what seemed good in his own eyes, is not meant that every individuall person did so to every man else; but the heads and leaders in these severall Tribes whereof the Sanhedrim consisted, being divided a∣mongst themselves by faction, and consequently drawing all those of their Tribe and party severally after them, it there∣upon came to pass that every man being thus divided from every man, as under these separate associations, they did every man unto every man, what seemed good in their own eyes. And this befell them because there was no King or Judge in those dayes to judge between blood and blood, and plea and plea; that is, such matters as happened to fall out between the Elders and great ones; and so too hard in judgment to be determined in the ordinary Courts, or re∣conciled in that higher Court either: since these Elders were both judges and parties therein. And therefore, Sir, if there be so muce danger of division and Civill war dependant on Elective principalities (even
because they are Elective) what may we more justly fear to be the event of such things in this Nation; where now, more then ever, every man stands from every man so much divided in Civill interest, but much more in matters of Reli∣gion? If there were one man Micha found amongst them, setting up a Teraphim and a Priest to himself, while there was no King there; what think we of our selves, that have lately had so many Micha's setting up their severall Tera∣phims in every corner, and that with such extravagant affe∣ctation of dissent from what is established, that they per∣swade themselves, that to be heterodox is to be orthodox? Will it not in this case highly concern us as we love our peace and quiet, to keep constant to one person and family of most moderate principles, and which is well known to carry a tender and universall regard to all, and so most likely in good time to bring us to a happy union again; then after his decease, to cast the Commonwealth into the danger of a new storm and shipwrack, by awaking the hopes of all that be heads and leaders in those severall sects and fa∣ctions that be among us, to be putting in for themselves, or some great favorer of their party? for if we finde such pack∣ing and siding for election of Parlament men, or the like, what stirs may we look for at the choice of a Protector? Out of which contest and dispute, suppose we should be so happy as to winde our selves without open War, and have one person at last chosen and agreed upon by the Major part of the appointed Electors; and suppose yet farther, that the present Army shall therein consent too, or else rest quiet; why yet since that person chosen must himself be of some party or another. and could not therefore come in by a joynt or universall consent, will it not hence come to pass (as beforesaid) that he being now in power, shall be natu∣rally provoked to acts of punishment and revenge towards such as have opposed, or have not, to his content and expe∣ctation, taken part with him? Whereupon, all that are of different parties from him must expect to live as in a state of persecution, or endanger a new civill War by joyning
in opposition. So that, if we be not actually broken one against another, yet advantage will be hereby still offered and encreased; and the whole Nation continually espoused into severall feuds and factions, to the overthrow of all charity and brotherly love. And if, to avoid this mischief, some way of restraint should be thought upon, by having a third Estate (like that in Poland) to bear a controule over their Kings actions; this, although it might, at some times, and for a while, keep the sore from breaking out, yet would it but encrease the swelling and distemper against a fit op∣portunity, by that encrease of Opinions which should fol∣low this generall freedom and toleration; as the experience of those many more Religions and Opinions in the same Poland, then elswhere, doe witness to be the fruits of Ele∣ctive and much limited Princes. Which is a course that cannot at all allay the discontents of those that live under his Government, and stand divided in interest or opinion. For since he must yet have some power left him to Rule with, he will still be as subject to be accused, by those that finde themselves crossed for having transcended his limits in that little Trust, as if he had had more. The which jealousie will be also increased, as well from that insolence which doth usually accompany persons newly preferred, as also, from that degree of impatience which useth again to be cast towards such as were lately but of equal condition with us, and are by our selves set up. Whenas, in Princes born, these things are not only patiently undergone, as out of sense of duty, but are also more tolerable and milde; as coming from such as were from their Cradles bred to sway Scep∣ters, and had been accustomed to such like honors and ad∣dresses. As thus, Sir, Elective and limited Monarchies doe nou∣rish parties and factions, for want of a common center of Union amongst themselves, so the generality of the subjects and people doe in them live in the highest degree of servi∣tude. Because those that call themselves the Free Princes and Nobility (as in Germany, Poland, Denmarke, &c.)
making it part of their freedom to debarr their Emperors and Kings from intermedling in their Jurisdictions, or from hearing the appeals or addresses of their Subjects (whih they arbitrarily govern according to their own privat laws, and not after the common law of the Empire and King∣dom) they must thereupon be by so much the more ensla∣ved, as their Emperor or King is less powerfull. And that which yet makes their case more hard, is, that since they are also liable to more Taxes then others, paying not onely to the support of their own Lords what they shal think fit, but also to the support of the Empire and Kingdom upon all publique Levies, they are thereby unreasonably put to maintain a power that cannot protect them. And 2 from the foregoing grounds, it is, found that, as Elective governments may be observed more short-lived then Hereditary; so also, of those that have or doe conti∣nue, there may be a daily lessening and doclension observed in them; by suffering severall parcels to be taken away by their Neighbours, or else to stand upon terms of absolute independency; as may be seen by those severall petit States of Italy and els where, canton'd off from the German Em∣pire. For why should those abso lute Princes and Lords, that have their peculiar Seignories and power, be so much concerned herein as to undergoe the charge and hazard of recovering those Territories and Dominions to a common Soveraignty only, whereof themselves have so little honor or benefit? and why should the Emperor or Prince (who holds but for life) endanger or impoverish himself herein, since he shall still keep on the same rank and title; and have, it may be, a good sum for his connivance. And so again, for that very time they doe continue, they come to owe their preservation more to outward occur∣rences and good luck, then their inward prudence or polity. As for example, the German Empire is beholding to the Turk, and to the Christian Princes its Neighbors for their agreement; who, by their continuall fears from abroad, keep them united and in peace at home. And by the like
accident is the Kingdom of Poland often kept from Civill War also: and also by keeping close to one family; which cannot afford many persons at once, whereby to make civil disturbance about Election. Besides, the German Empire is also kept in some agreement by that respect therein given to the Papall Sea. For the Pope having, by much strugling and policie, pulled down the power of those Emperors, and by his golden Bull setled it as now it is (having half the Electors Bishops) hath still kept up such a power and reve∣rentiall respect amongst them, as to awe any one there, from making himself so great and absolute, as to be again in competition with him for mastery: or, (on the other side) to suffer the Electors or other Estates to invade or diminish that greatness and glory left him; least also that honour of his own should abate in the loss of so honourable a servant. And since the time of Luther it hath been preserved by the policie of the Austrian family; who ever since getting their sons setled in their life times, have kept it from those distractions which might accompany new choice. Another inconvenience attending elective Soveraignties, is decay of publique Revenue, and provisions of all kinds both for war and peace. For how shall it be thought that those that hold but for his life, should either repair what was done by another, or attempt the erection of such mag∣nificent works and foundations, which could not likely be in that time accomplished; and which, in the doing also, must rob his family of so much in propriety, as that cost would have come to? So that these things having their reasons apparent, I shall forbear examples therein, as I have done in many things foregoing, and shall do in most that follow; fearing also, Sir, that I have already made too great an assault on your patience, and transcended the allowable bulk of a Letter. But, Sir, since all mens reading and expe∣rience do inform them that money hath been and will be the usual purchaser of preferment, it must be presumed that the person aiming at this greatness, doth intend that the publick stock shall again make good his disbursment.
But, may some think, the Princes and Nobles, or those in power, will look to all exorbitance in this kind. No, Sir, they will rather encourage it: for they were the persons that were first bribed for his entrance, and so cannot in ju∣stice but see him (at least) repay himself again. Besides, they being but few, and bearing no great proportion in their own particulars, towards publick levies, may be su∣spected less careful of what is done therein, and may also have their good will purchased by part thereof. As the ne∣cessity of compliance with the great ones that holp him in and do support him, must thus exhaust the publick stock, so also the care and thought for preservation and main∣tenance of his own family and other dependents, must cause him to imploy that study and endeavour which should be intent to advance the publick stock as his own, to seek to take from it all he can, that it may be so indeed. So that if we should still make change of families for our Governor, and pick out of any according as one happened to have a fitter person then another, it must be supposed that the same sum that would suffice for the maintenance of one fa∣mily, would not, by much, be sufficient to afford proportions to advance and ennoble a great many, in such sort that they may carry a continual shew and rank answerable to that place which was once executed by their ancestor: And if we think of putting the election and power of comptroll in more persons (as in the people, in Parliaments, or the like) as thinking a multitude of suffrages and consents are not so easily purchased; we might yet be herein mistaken also, since we are informed that Caesar and others could tell how to bribe whole Commonwealths (or those that bore the name thereof) both to be elected and kept Dicta∣tors, or the like offices: And that Senators or Parliament-men may be drawn by money, preferment, or other relation or interest, is but too truly known. If, Sir, you should think fit to choose but out of some few more Noble families, to avoid the impoverishing of the common stock by enriching so many little ones, as they do in Germany; then how will
you do to pick out such in England, as now it is, without discontent and danger too, to arise from those that are se∣cluded? Will you keep to one family, as they in Poland have done? why, this is yet better. But the best course of all is to do as they do now in Germany, and as hath been ever practised in these Nations, to keep not only to one fa∣mily, but to observe the same order of descent in this chief place of authority, as is by the law of God and the Land observed in other families in the inheritance of all things else. Sir, when you have thus done, you and the rest of the House may then, and not till then, rest assured that you have answered that great trust reposed in you, The peace and settlement of these Nations. For to settle us otherwise, were but to unsettle us by that settlement. And this, Sir, I may also press upon you as a duty you owe to those you represent, even the satisfaction of the desires of the people in generall, which I may con∣fidently affirm is strongly enclined to that only form of Go∣vernment they have heretofore so long and so happily lived under, And which upon a just conference with that dispa∣rity which is between us and those other places where Ele∣ction is practised, cannot with safety be altered. For Sir, since we have no such standing rank of Gentry, Nobility, and free Princes, as in Venice, Poland, Germany, &c. which should hereditarily make up the body of a standing supreme Councell; nor doe not now so much as allow of that ancient right of Peerage in our Parlaments, but have levelled all to the order of Commons: and since we do not, like other places, cast any such reverentiall fear towards Pope or any Foraign prince, from whom, as from an Um∣pire our differences might receive ready reconciliation; and we being also an Island, are not like other places, so much in danger of Foraign surprize and invasion, whereby to be frighted to agreement, in case we should fall out about the person or the power of the Prince to be elected. It is there∣fore much more, on our parts, to be feared, that upon the death of every Protector, a general jealousie and fear of
what shall next happen will amuse and disturb every one, as not knowing whether they shall continue under the same laws and form of government they were before. For first, suppose it to be in the interval of Parliament, and so the chief power and command being in the Councel, may they not by the same power they command them in all other things, forbid the Keepers of the Great Seal for making out Writs, or the Sheriffs for making Elections? What likeli∣hood that either will oppose a power in being, and able to reward as well as protect them; upon fear that a power may arise to punish them, but cannot do it till they be called, nor be called till themselves shall think fit? In which case to suppose the Army, such an one as may be then in being, shall lay aside all consideration of advantages to themselves, likely to be offered from such a Councel as may be also, and on the contrary, to be ready to compel those that are their legal Superiors to proceed to election, or calling of a Par∣liament, is as far unlikely. Or suppose the Protector should die, the Parliament sitting; why then this being the supreme power, is it not to be presumed they will take to themselves as much power in matters of government as other Parlia∣ments have done, and so rescind what was before establish∣ed as an impeachment to their perpetuity, even the power of a Protector and his Councel? Now as these confusions and alterations of the Government as now established, are more to be feared from us then in other places, both for want of practice in the steering and dividing of our duties amongst such like Coordinate powers, and for want of one only standing supreme Council to direct, without fear of a dormant higher power to succeed; so is it much more on our parts to be feared, that through that siding and inter∣medling which an Army may hereafter make between these jurisdictions, both the government may be changed, and the publique peace hazarded. For it being evident, that in all those places where the Soveraign Magistrate and the person of the highest rank is elective, and so the Govern∣ment subject to intervals, there those of the next Order are hereditarily seised of the Soveraignty as in fee, until they
shall again lease the same out to another for life; and so again, where the Soveraignty is hereditary in one family, there on the other side those next subordinate Officers to be imployed in the Government are elective and dependent on him: It must therefore come to pass, that if this Council or Order of men that is to have power in the interregnum should be elective also, then must that Government depend upon contingencies; because there may not be enow of them, or enow rightly chosen to compleat such an assembly. Now since with us there is not (as I said) such a standing Order or Council claiming power by birth, but it is in some sort necessary and convenient that the Officers of the Army should be taken in as members both of Council and Parlia∣ment, it will follow, that in case the Council should consist mostly of such, there were no likelihood that a Parliament should be called. But if the Parliament should have more or other then those that made up the Council, then is it again to be feared, that in order to the continuance of their own power, they would cause both the power of Council and future Protectors to be voted down also. For how can it be imagined, that in this vicissitude and sliding from one Master to another, they shall be so equally favoured and used by Protector, Parliament and Council, in their several turns of power, as to stand on all hands so indifferently en∣gaged to all and each of them, that they shall not cleave to the one, and hate and despise the other; but shall, to a man, be one day for the Council against all other, and on the morrow when the Parliament shall sit, do the like for them? If things do not happen just so, then will one Coordinate overthrow the other, by their partial and unequal siding; Or that which is yet worse, by their division hereabout they will involve us into a state of Civil war. And truly, Sir, although from such an Army, such a Council, and such a Parliament as we now have, encroachments and justlings on one another are not to be much feared; yet, Sir, that there may be just ground given to suspect such events for the future, will be very apparent to him that shall reflect on those sad consequences which might have been the issue of
such high and turbulent agitations and endeavours as were by some fiery spirits set on foot in the begining of this very Parliament. You are not sure, Sir, that the Protector and the General shall always be the same man, or that he shall be of equal prudence and reputation with this; so as by his discretion & authority, all such mischief may be prevented. And therefore, Sir, since our future peace and establishment ought chiefly to be provided for, I pray think in how un∣certaine a condition you leave us, if you leave all to depend on election; and that election to be or not be, to be wel and orderly done or ill done, as the parties therein entrusted shall be faithful and able, or biassed and ignorant. For it is not enough in such a case to propound things fit to be done by any, unless there be withall some others appointed to see them do it: the which also may faile in their trust, and so need others again to see them doe their duties: and then it will come to pass that those that are last trusted will be chiefly or first trusted, whereas that high tituled officer that was first trusted wil be least trusted, and so come to be lowest of all. And by this settling of watchmen upon watchmen, you will bring all business to a stand, whilst those officers that are to act shall have no power to act, and those that are not to act shall have all. But since experience doth make it manifest, that at last some persons must be trusted, and that for some time also; in order to reconcile publick differences, how madly doth it look to take such a middle course herein, as shall neither attain the good, nor avoid the evil intended? They that will trust a man for his life, doe run the utmost minute of hazard he hath to do it in: and do then set the gap open again, for Civil combustion about the next Election, when as his heir may prove as good as another. And they that will not afford their Prince so much power as to be in all causes, and over all persons supreme, doe not only still want a decider of quarrels amongst themselves, but do also therby add such new occasion of quarrels about power as they may afterwards have with him. And therefore since Election cannot assure us of goodness; nay, since good Princes may
change to ill (as Nero that for 5 years was the best, & after∣wards the worst of any) 'tis best to make sure of that certain benefit of publick peace, by keeping close to one family, and by allowing sufficiency of power, then increase the disease by those remedies of election of persons, and limitation of his power. Sir, there was a time indeed when Monarchy and Ty∣rannie, Parlaments and Liberty were thought to be the same, but the experience of our condition under that long, long, long, Parliament, a and that little once since; hath rectifyed our judgements, and brought us to look on that Text as Canonical, and on him as a wise man that said, For the wic∣kedness of a Land many are the Princes thereof, but by a man of understanding the state thereof is preserved, Prov. 28.2. We do acknowledge that in the multitude of Councellors there is safety, Prov. 11.14. but we look for no such matter from a multitude of Controlers. So that Vox populi being now Vox Dei, we hope you will, in your debates of Go∣vernment, Ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, that we may finde rest for our souls, Jer. 6.16. In this Sir, we shall not contend with you for names, but things. If you will have our Soveraign Magistrate to be called Protector, we like it well: it is an Office we want, and do therefore desire he may have that power left him as will enable him to perform it: suffer him to wear a sword Sir, or else he can neither protect us nor himself. And if again, you will have our former great Councel called by the An∣cient name of Parliament, we pray you also, that the thing may be again reduced: and made agreeable to the name; let them have freedom to speak their minds, but not to do them. No more of that Sir. For it is a yoak which our Fathers never knew of, nor are we able to bear. And there∣fore as you and the rest do now represent us, and are to make known our grievances, we do desire that you would take notice of this as a great one. For you may rest assured that, were this Nation poled, not one in twenty but would desire their old Government again.
But it is now time, Sir, to desire something for my self; namely, your pardon for the tediousness and extravagancie of the passed discourses, and also your favorable construction of my meaning in them, which was not to find fault with any thing already done, or to instruct you what to doe. No, Sir, as you have always known me a quiet man un∣der Government, and respectful to my present Su∣periors therein; so I beseech you to believe that I am so far from intending a Censure of any thing this way established, that my drift hath been to de∣fend it against all others; especially that part which is most malign'd, as having most tendencie towards Monarchy. For, finding (as I said) many Pam∣phlets of late thrown abroad to render that Form odious and disadvantagious to the people, that thereby you might be prejudiced and affrighted from making any farther settlement that way, I have thereupon presumed it expedient, even for your own and publick satisfaction, that something should be also said on the other side; that so you might be again brought to some even poize in your judgments, before you come to determination in this great affair. And therefore, as they would have had the World believe that you had not re∣spected the peoples welfare, if you had setled the Protector and his Issue; so have I endeavoured to make it appear, that you cannot doe the Nation a better courtesie then by so doing. The which coming from one so disinteressed as I am to him and his family by any relation, will the sooner, I hope, find acceptance as a word spoken in season:
Nay farther, Sir, He is one that I never received courtesie and encouragement from in the least kind; and as for his Children, I know not the face of one of them. What I have said, Sir, hath been that which in my judgment is most for the general be∣nefit: And hath been the sudden issue of mine own brain, as by the indigestion both of method and matter will be but too apparent. The Author having nothing to boast of, but that he is SIR, Your most affectionate Servant. FINIS.
