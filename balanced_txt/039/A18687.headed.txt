¶ Here foloweth a notable treatyse and full neces¦sary to all crysten men for to knowe and it is na∣med the Ordynarye of Crystyanyte or of crysten men. ¶ Here foloweth the Prologue. EVery creature resonable vnto who me god hath gyuen mynde & vn∣derstandynge & wyll. Hym ought to knowe serue & loue with all his myght as moche for the goodnes and noblenes of his creacyon as
well as of his redempcyon & of the glory that we trust in. The whiche thynges be so grete & good that no herte them may thynke ne tonge can them declare. Also he ought to be fered for to eschewe yt payne of eternall dampnacyon. The whiche is so horryble a thynge oonly to ymagen that there is none erthely herte that by a thousande yeres yf he so longe sholde lyue vpon erthe / but yt euery daye he ought to tremble. And these paynes we may not eschewe ne the goodes of eternall glorye haue ne possed. Yf we be not obedyent vnto our creatour in kepynge our vowe & baptem / and in accomplys∣shynge all his cōmaundementēs. The whiche toSi vis ad vitam ingredi serua mā¦data. Mathxx. knowe & vnderstande euery man ought to put al∣so grete dilygence & more / as he doth for to saue his corporell lyf. For otherwyse he may not longeCōfitebor tibi in directōe cordis ∣eo {quam} didi iudi∣cia iusticie tu. ps. xviii. go eschewynge synne nor of the fautes cōmytted ayenst ye wyll of god hym clense repent & confesse.

In the whiche shall be spoken pryn∣cypally of fyue thyng{is}.

The
fyrst is of the artycles of the fayth. The seconde of the cōmaūdementes of the lawr. The thyrde of synnes ye whiche a man ought to eschewe. The fourthe of the paynes of helle the whiche a man ought to fere. And the fyfth of the glory the whi∣che is without ende that euery man ought to desy¦re. Of these fyue thynges in example of the holy apostell ought to wryte preche & teche all they that wyll please god / and vnto these soules proufyte / & all ryght faythfull crysten men / the whiche haue desyre to come vnto saluacyon hym ought aboue all thynges to rede or here. For whoos deth the con¦trary hath in hym the sygne of eternall dampna∣cyon / as they that loue better Romayns of warr{is}. of bataylles / wrytynges of poetes / & of these phy∣losophres erthely. The whiche make not the lyues & examples of holy sayntes and other holy wry∣tynges that touchen the dede of conscyence and of theyr saluacyon / and man sayth that wylfully su∣che people renneth after ye prechers the whiche pryn¦cypaly secheth to speke vnto the worldely people for to go with theyr substaūce & syluer / the whiche oftentymes inplye the mynde of them worldely in hye harde & curyous questyons / & by the swetnesse of fayre speche they wrape them & brynge them to theyr ende. So as prophecyed saynt Poule in the pystle vnto the bysshop Thimothee sayeng the ty¦me shall come that the worlde wyl no more of the good doctryne and salutary / but they shall desyre maysters that them shall tell & preche thynges cu∣ryous & fables the whiche vnto them shall be plea

Of the whiche synners wryteth saynt Peter in spekyng vnto crysten men / & sayth that so as it was of the people of the Jewes fals & cursyd pro∣phetes sȳners / so vnto them shall it come for ther shall come & aryse amonge them some maysters full of falsenes of cursydnes & of disceyte the whi¦che shall gyue vnto the people occasyon of theyr pardicyon.

Also it is to be noted yt as well for to satysfye vnto these clerkes & for the more parfectly to conferme yt the whiche is wryten in englysshe as also for to esche∣we & detraccion of lytell vnderstandynge of sym∣ple people I put in the heed of this boke in many passages these auctorytees conuocacions & allega∣cions the whiche be made in latyn / excepte ye texte of the vowe of baptyme the whiche I haue wyll to put worde by worde in this wrytynge for to shewe the charyte ruyne of crysten people in all estates in the whiche they lyuen at this daye. That is to
wyte the .xiiij. daye of January the yere of our lor¦de. M. CCCC. lxvij. after the Natyuyte of our lorde Jhesu cryste after dyuers cronycles & maner of nombre the yeres. In the whiche yere and daye this present boke hath be fyrst begonne to be wry∣ten. ¶ Here endeth the prologue / and now foloweth the fyrst parte of baptem.
¶ Here foloweth the fyrst parte of this present bo¦ke / of the vowe and sacrament of baptem. AS vnto the fyrste partye the whi∣cheCapitulū pri¦mū. is of the vowe & sacrament of baptem / it is to be noted yt after that Jhesu cryst had made publys¦she & preche solemply the trouthe of the gospell as well by his holy
apostles / as by other prechers / it is impossyble forJohis .viii. Qui ex deo est ba dei audit. Johis .iii. nisi s renatfuerit ex a∣qua & spu sacto nō pōt introire i reg∣nū dei. Mar. vit. Qui cre¦didrit & baptisa∣t tuerit salu erit. Nō pōt solui scri∣ptura ohis .x. man to be saued that is not baptysed. And he that byleued in Jhesu cryst & is baptysed. In lyke wyse it is impostyble but that fynally he be saued. For it is the mouth of god the whithe is the sentence & texte of the gospell that so vnto vs wytnesseth / wherfore it is a thynge ryght necessary to knowe ¶ Fyrste how & in what maner the sacrament of baptem ought to be gyuen. ¶ Secondely the for∣me & maner to execute it solemly. ¶ Thyrdely the vertue and the effecte that it hath in the soule of a crysten man. ¶ And fourthly to knowe euery ar¦tycle of the fayth in partyculer. ¶ As vnto y• fyrst that is to vnderstande that to crysten or baptem is as moche to saye as to wasshe / and is vnderstande pryncypally of the soule / the whiche by the verte of god is puryfyed / hauynge this sacrament from all synne / be it pryde venyall or mortall. And for as moche that ye puyssaūce of god is not restrayn∣te ne bounde by the institucyon of these sacramen¦tes the whiche of pure myght absolueth he may in many maners clense & purge the soule & it wa∣she from synne. ¶ The doctours saye that thereTriplex baptis∣mus. are thre maner of baptemes. The fyrst maner is whan ony persone shall by preuylege syngulerly sanctifyed from orygynall synne afore that he beAnte{quam} exieris de vulua sāctificaui¦te. Hiere. i. borne or after the pleasure & wyll of god / as were saynt Jheremy and saynt Johan baptyst. The se∣conde whan ony not baptysed vnto the purpose / to make hym baptysed in place & tyme / and befor that he be baptysed / he deyeth by martyrdome or
otherwyse / he may be in the waye of saluacyon yf he haue none other lettynge. The thyrde is the cō¦mune & sacramentall the whiche is done by worde & water. And suche sacrament & all other ought to be ordynatly executed by man preest or curate as vnto that of Jhesu cryste true god and true man. But in the caas of necessyte the baptem may be gyuen dewely by euery other persone erthely that may haue puyssaūce & intencyon to do & say that that holy chirche doth & sayth in admynystrynge solemly suche sacrament. For yf it so be that there be a man / that myght & ought to do it a woman ought not it to do / yf there were clerke in holy or∣dres / the subdeacon ought not to do it before the deacon / nor the lay man before the symple clerke. or otherwyse they synne. And yf ther be oportuny¦te of tyme they sholde be it man or woman requy∣re mercy with grete contricyon of theyr synnes yf they haue remorse of conscyence of deedly synne. For he that admynystreth or receyueth ony sacra∣ment he ought to be in the state of grace / & that is as vnto the mynysters of that sacrament. Also it is to knowe that euery creature erthely not bap∣tysed is bounde to receyue that sacrament as it is sayd in place & tyme. But otherwyse was this ob∣lygacyon accomplysshed at the begynnynge man was not baptysed but in the vigyll of Eester & of Whytsontyde / & they that dewely were cathecumi¦nus: that is to saye instructe of the artycles of the fayth & of that / yt they ought to vowe or promytte But after by the inspyracyon of the holy goost it
was ordeyned that these childern forthwith after yt they were borne sholde be baptysed. For in them is no thynge that may lette the effecte of that sa∣cramēt / as sholde be mortall sȳne actuel or fiction And that procedeth of the mercy & Justyce dyuyne For so as two persones that is to knowe Adam & Eue vs bynde all by lawe comonly to synne and dampnacyon wtout our gylte actuell. So pleaseth vnto the Justyce dyuyne that our fader Jhesu cryst & our moder holy chirche sygnifyeth the godfader and godmoder vs promyttynge vnto saluacyon before that we haue vsauuce reason or myght of ony operacyon. ¶ Here foloweth the maner to conferme the holy baptem in the artycle of necessyte. Of the maner to conferme the sacrament ofCapitulū. ij. baptem in the caas of necessyte. That is to knowe that yf a woman or other symple persone baptyse he ought to take hede vnto ye mater of the sacrament vnto the forme of the wordes and vnto the intencyon. Fyrst vnto ye mater. For that ought to be water naturell. For man may not be bapty∣sed with wyne / with sydre / with blood / with mylke with vryne / with water of roses / or other water dy∣stylled / but man shal be baptysed in necessyte with lye / and with water in the whiche man shall haue smarte in the flesshe. And it is holy thynge & good coūseyll that a man haue holy water in his house For yf it were wel possyble man sholde not be bap∣tysed
with other water. Also it is to aduyse symple people that yf there apere ony membre of the chil¦de in the whiche men knoweth lyf & of the whiche he fereth the deth before that it be borne {per}fectly he it sholde baptyse in that membre the whiche ape∣reth. Also yf the moder passe this lyf before the na¦tyuyte of the childe ye whiche a man byleueth truly lyf in her / he ought hastely to gaffe her mouth / & after dyscretly open the bely of the woman & bap¦tyse the lytell childe yf it be foūde on lyue / yf it be founde deed it ought not to be buryed within the holy groūde / yf the moder hath not ben slayne & put to deth for the loue of god or for the trouth of the fayth. For in suche caas may doctours holde yt ye childe sholde be martyr. For it is more to fere & toNota. playne where a childe deyeth without the receyuyn¦ge the sacrament of baptem then it doth of the de¦struccyon & the fallynge in to depnes of all ye to w∣nes castelles / & cytees of the worlde. In the whiche apereth the grete synne / & the grete blame of those the whiche them gouerne ylle in this mater what so euer maner it be in. As vnto the forme that is those wordes the whiche he ought to saye / he beho∣ueth to take hede vnto theym that be ordeyned of god & of holy chirche as well in caas of necessyte as of solempnyte. That is to knowe Ego baptiso¦te In nomīe patris et filij et spiritus sancti amen.De forma baptismi. And in englysshe. I baptyse the in the name of the fader & of the sone & of the holy goost. Or in other langage or wordes betokenynge the same sentence For one may baptyse in all maner of langages /
And it behoueth that the wordes & the doynge that is to put the water vpon the childe be holy in ony wyse togyder. That is to saye that before that he hath sayd all these wordes he haue begonne to put the water or before that he hath endeth to put the water he begynne the wordes / for otherwyse there is no baptyme. That is to knowe yf a man saye all these wordes & after put the water or fyrst en∣deth to put the water & after sayth these wordes. As to the entencyon / that is to knowe that at theDe intentio∣ne. lest that persone the whiche baptyseth ought to ha¦ue intencyon to do that / that our moder the holy chirche intendeth & cōmaūdeth to do & it may suf¦fyse suche generall intencyon / so that he byleueth the same or haue in his intencyon yt the sacramēt of baptem purefyeth man from all synne or tha these wordes afore sayd suffyse. That is I bapty∣se the in the name of the fader & of the sone & of the holy goost / that he saye not with that & of our lady & of saynt Johan or of thynge lyke he hath not than baptym / for the intencyon the whiche is of necessyte of the sacramēt is not good nor ryght∣full. Of other cases & diffycultees the whiche be in this mater sholde these curates & prechers somty∣me shewe in publysshynge for these dyuers & pyte∣ous cases the whiche by Ignoraunce may come in many places of crystendome. The seconde thynge pryncypally to be consydered in this mater is of ye forme & maner the whiche is moost comonly hol∣den in the holy chirche of Rome in baptysynge so∣lemply in the whiche I shall holde this maner or∣dre. Fyrst I shal declare what it is to saye exorciser
and cathecyser. Secondely I shal put the latyn as well of the ordynary as of the orysons & other thȳ¦ges soo as men vse in the chirche moost comonly. And thyrdely I shal put the subitaūce of the latyn afore sayd in englysshe & the significacion of that that is done & sayd after ye exposicyon of some do∣ctours in holy theology. As vnto ye fyrst that is to knowe that the exorcysyon & cathecysacyon oughtde exorcismo. to procede the baptem but for the good vnderstan¦dynge the whiche is exorcyser that is to be noted yt whan Adam & Eue vnto whome god had gyuen dominacyon of all the morlde disobeyed vnto god the deuyll toke power vpon theym & in lyke wyseGene. i.

But af∣ter yt Crystendome was moche augmented & mul¦teplyed the blessyd holy goost hath enspyred ye holy chirche of the maner to do it more certen & {pro}fyta¦ble.

And for so moche our blessyd god & lorde we the requyre that this creature of salte be made suche sacrament in the name of the blessyd trynyte that he may chasse the deuyll.

Take now the salt of true sapyence / to ye ende yt it may please god to gyue the grace for to come to the lyf eternall Amen.
HEre is to be noted as for the entent of thyn¦gesHer secundū gu∣lermū durau, afore sayd as for those that folowe the whiche in this solempnyte of exorcysm{us} / or of con∣iuracyon of the deuyll some thynges they make in operacyon wtout all only / the whiche thynges are not in the soule materyally. But they betoken thȳ¦ges spirytuell as in puttynge the salt in yt mouth of the childe / he puttynge of ye spotell of the preest in his nosetrylles & in his eeres / he makynge the crosse with the holy oyle in the brest & bytwene the sholders. Also after the baptem he maketh ye crosse with the holy crme vpon the childes heed / he put¦teth on hym afterwarde the whyte robe the which is called the crysome. And of the signifycacyon of all these thynges shall be sayd euery thynge in his ordre. These other thynges be / the whiche signifye & make that / that they signifye / & in these thyng{is} there is dede & worde as in the coniuracyon of the deuyll whan the preest vnto hym sayth. Cursed & dampned spiryte / departe then forth wt from this creature / as it is also the imposicyon of the hande & of other thynges that folowe. They sygnifye & make ryally in dede that / that these wordes sygni∣fye. And it so be mayster Guillyam duraūt it pre¦uethGuillerm {con}durādi in quarto. in his quart by reason & by auctoryte. His rea¦son is suche. The blyssed holy goost ye whiche may not fayle or bere fals wytnes / gouerneth & illumy¦neth the chirthe in all thynges / & syngulerly in the solempnyte & custome of the seuen sacramentes. Wherfore it behoueth to saye that these wordes & these dedes that man holdeth & kepeth in the custo¦me of the chirche in executynge these sacramentes
be not made for no thynge & with thynkynge / but ryally & truely make & sygnifye the thynges befo¦re ayd.  vnto that is ye auctoryte of saynt Au¦gustyn the whiche ayth that these lytell childern be blowed on & exorcysed by the preest to ye entent that they be put out & delyuered from the puyssaū¦ce of the deuyll / & to the entent that they haue not in theyr soules ony lettynge to receyue the grace of god & to be made and consecrated the temple of the holy goost. Rest than to see what sygnyfyeth vs the salte so nobly consecrated / and put in to the childes mouth. For the fyrst mrsell of his dyner is not oonly to moche salt / but as vnto the trouth it is but salt. And it is now manytested that it is not gyuen to hym for substaunce or reteccyon cor∣orell / but for some sygnyfycacyon spyrytuell. The whiche sygnyfycacyon vnto vs is gyuen for to vnderstande by the proprete naturell of salte / the whiche is moche more gretter and larger in foure maners. The fyrst is that the salt dryeth the erthe in suche a maner that she may not ony her∣bes gyue or brynge forth after the salte. The secon¦de is that it gyueth sauouor vnto the metes. The thyrde is that it keppeth the meetes from putre∣fyenge and from roynge. And the fourth that it is made of the water of the see by the force of fy∣re. The fyfth is that god cōmaunded vnto Moy∣ses that in all the sacryfyces the whiche he offred that he sholde put salt therto. And by these pro∣pretees vnto vs is fygured truely as wytnesseth the holy scrypture the noble vertue of sapyence and of dyscrecyon by the whiche man deserueth bytwe∣ne

fylthy & vnclene. By the baptem the soule is pure fyed & made clene from all ordure of synne. The water gyueth refrygeracyon. The baptem taketh & coleth the inclynacyon and the corrupcyon the whiche is abydynge in humayne nature for ye gylt of origynall synne / for yf two childer of lyke com¦plexion / of the whiche yt one sholde be baptysed & that other not. I put that he wende to be were they nourysshed togyder / he yt was not baptysed shalbe more inclyned to ylle & more harde in doctryne thē he baptysed. Also the water quenched & owted the thyrste. The baptem refeccyoneth the soule & kepeth it from dryenge & from deth. Also ye water causeth the erthe to bere & fructefye. The baptem causeth the soule to fructefye spyrytually in good werkes / in vertues & in meryt{is}. Also by ye baptem the soule receyued ye lyuery / the token / & ye caracter afore sayd. Also he receyued distinccyon with these paynems & not baptysed. Also he receyued augmē¦tacyon of grace & lyght of knowlege spirytuell / & is incorporat & vnyed with holy chirche the whiche is ye mystycall body of Jhesu cryst. Also he is quyte & assoyled of the obligacyon in the whiche euery persone not baptysed is boūden. Also by ye baptem is the yate of heuen opened. After these thyng{is} be∣fore sayd the preest maketh the crosse with the ho∣ly creme vpon ye forhede of hym that is baptysed / in namynge hym & makynge suche prayer.

Here is to be noted yt the holy creme is composed of bame & of oyle vnyed & sanctefyed by ye benediccion of the bysshop. By ye bame y• whiche kepeth all maner of flesshe from rottynge & frō corrupcyon / to vs is sig¦nifyed y• soule the whiche gyued lyf vnto ye body / & kepeth it frō rottynge durynge ye tyme yt it is vnyed wt the body. By ye oyle to vs is signifyed the body. And by ye bysshop vnto vs god is represented ye whi¦che these thyng{is} of so moche dyfference yt is ye body & ye soule hath vnyed & assembled & gyuen his e & benediccyon vnto humayne nature. And for so moche sayen these doctours yt a symple preest suppo¦synge yt he had baptysed ye childe sholde not sette yt crosse of ye holy creme in ye presence of ye bysshop / yf it were not by his specyall cōmaūdemēt / & yt is for the holynes of ye creme & of the mystery & of the be¦nediccyon the whiche by yt is signifyed. Also it is to be noted that this crosse made & gyuen vnto the newe crysten man is the seuenth crosse & the laste that is sette on his body / or the fourteneth in this mystery in acoūtynge these other seuen the whiche be made in ye exorcysacōn of the salte the whiche is put in his mouth. By ye salt the whiche vnto vs be tokeneth wysdome / we vnderstande consequently the soule / & so there be made seuē crosses as vnto ye body / & as many vnto the soule / & they be fourtene Forther more it is to be consydered yt it sygnifyed the nombre of seuen ye whithe betokened the crosse And vnto that sayth saynt Gregory yt by the nom¦bre
of seuen vniuersyte to vs is sygnifyed. For all thynges that god hath made be they corporell or spirytuell / may be brought & deuysed in seuen. Of these corporell there be seuen planetes vnto the bo¦dy celestyall the whiche haue▪ theyr influence puys∣saūce operacyon & gouernynge vpon these thyng{is} a lowe. Also there be seuen ages in all the worlde / seuenQui em̄ septē die∣bus ōne temp cō∣prehendit: recte septenario nume∣to vniuersitas de signat. Hec Gr. dayes in the weke & no mo / seuen sacramēt{is} in the holy chirche / seuen gyftes of the holy goost / seuen werkes of mercy / seuen deedly synnes. And also of other thyng{is} y• whiche may be brought vn∣to seuen / by y• whiche a man may well knowe yt by the nombre of seuen to vs is signifyed vnyuerlyte. Also by ye token of ye crosse in what so euer maner yt it be made / be it in wood / in stone / in golde & in syl¦uer or wt ye hande or otherwyse / ye passyon of yt bles¦syd Jh̄u cryst to vs betokened / by y• whiche he hath had victory of all his aduersaryes vnto his enmyes confusyon. Also hath rescuwed and delyuered hu∣mayne lygnage / broken ye yates of helle / & opened the realme of paradyse. And for to speke shortely / all ye goodnesses of ḡce of benediccōn & of glory pro¦ceden of ye depnesses of ye blessyd passyon / & therfor of good ryght all faythfull crysten men ought to receyue ye token of y• crosse for honour / for tryūphe / for it is ye shelde & defence ayenst all our aduersa∣ryes. That is to knowe ye worlde the deuyll / & our sensualyte or poryde / coueytous / & lechery. Wherfor in ye mystery of baptem ye newe knyght entryng in to y• batell of crystyente ayenst these thre aduersa∣ryes afore sayd / taketh & receyueth the soules / and the lyuerey of blessyd Jhesu cryste chyef duke and
capytayne of al them that ben chosen. By the whi¦che armes well kepte he shall haue knowlege de∣fence & vyctorye in all thynges / wherfore of good ryght it is sygned seuen tymes as vnto ye body & se¦uen as vnto the soule / wherof that of the creme is the last & the souerayne. For by that he is proprely called a crysten man / ye whiche is as moche to say as anoynted / or of god consecrated. And therfore whan these childer of these crysten men be put vn∣to scole for to lerne connynge / vnto them is gyuen for the begynnynge & for the fundacyon of all wy¦sedome / crystis crosse / for to shewe yt incōparyson of the knowlege of the crosse / is always to be vn∣derstande his passyon. All other scyences erthely or worldely is but foly / all noblenes as vylany / all rychesse as pouerte / all delytes be not but as byt∣ternesses / & temporall lyf the begynnynge of deth Afterwarde the preest gyueth vnto the childe the crysome aboue his heed vnto hym sayenge. Take now the whyte leuery the whiche is without spote the whiche thou mayst kepe and bere at the grete daye of Jugement / the whiche our lorde Jhesu cry¦ste shall holde / vnto whome be honour & glory in the worlde of worldes amen. ¶ Also vnto hym gy¦ueth the preest a taper brennynge in his ryght han¦de saynge vnto hym. Take now this lyght ye whi¦che is without reproche / kepe thy baptem / kepe thy cōmaūdementes / to the ende that whan our lorde shall come for to make these weddynges / wherof these promysses be made by this holy baptem thou them mayst receyue as the faythfull spouse of thy soule in ye company of all ye sayntes of paradyse /
in the whiche y• mayst lyue eternally in the worlde of worldes amen. By these thre thyng{is} done after the baptem / that is of the crysome / of the creme / & of the lyght be signifyed grete thynges spirituell / For by the creme receyued in tokē of the crosse the whiche is the propre token where the armes be of Jhesu cryst / & is signifyed yt he is named the crystē broder of Jhesu cryst in armes / & parte taker & en∣herytour wt hym in the realme of paradyse. AndNota. it is to be noted that auncyently foure maner of people all oonly be anoynted wt the holy vnccyon that is to knowe these kyng{is} / these knyght{is} / these preestes / & these prophet{is} / the whiche thynge is do¦ne in token and fygure of faythfull crysten men. The whiche anoynted with the holy creme may saye truely kyng{is} yf they gouerne truely the real∣me of theyr conscyence & the estate of theyr voca∣cyon / for yf they haue in this present batayll vic∣tory of the worlde / of the deuyll / & of theyr sensua¦lyte they shalbe crowned as noble kyng{is} & knygh¦tes / & so shall haue totall & peasyble possessyon of the realme of paradyse. Also they may be sayd sa∣cerdotales the whiche is as moche to saye as enry∣ched & ennobled with holy mysteryes. Now it is so that the crysten man the whiche hath thre noble vertues in the soule / that is fayth / hope / & charyte hath the gyftes of the holy goost / & is the habyta∣cyon & temple of all the holy trynyte / by the whi∣che he may well be named preest or sacerdotal. Al∣so prophetes is moche to saye as they that see and knowe thyng{is} to come. And the good crysten man by the lyght of fayth sayth & consydered the pay∣nes
of helle / by the whiche he shewed all ylle & all synne. Also he seeth & consydered the shortnes of this lyf & the grete glorye of paradyse / by the whi¦che he hasted & enforced hym to accomplysshe good werkes & merytoryous / by the whiche he may co∣me vnto so grete goodnes. And in accomplysshyn∣ge these two thynges / that is to flee ylle and to do good / he gyueth good example vnto his neygh∣bours / by the whiche he preched better than he the whiche is in the chayre & declared these holy wry∣tynges / whan the lyfe & the werkes of suche a pre∣chour ben contraryous to the cōmaūdemēt of god By the crysome is signifyed the beaute & the inno¦cencye of the soule / the whiche is annorned & enno∣bled with all vertues / as the noble spouse of Jhesu cryst. Also by that is signifyed the beaute and the do wars of the body after the resurreccyon / for it shall be more shynynge than the sonne. It sygny∣fyedFulge būt usti si∣cut sol in cōspectu¦de.

By the lyght the whiche ought to be in the hande / & not in the mouth or bytwene the feet is sygnyfyed the example of good werkes / by the whiche werke eue∣ry good crysten man ought to be lyght before the worlde. By the ryght hande often a man vnder∣standeth the good werkes. And therfore as after these holy mysteryes done & accōplysshed / the lytel childe is the childe of god & of the holy chirche / he wyll not it leue without kepynge & nourysshynge. For not withstandynge by the mercy of god he be clene from all synne / and replenysshed with all vertues & of beaute inestymable as vnto the soule. How be it by the Justyce of god he abydeth subget
vnto the body / vnto hungre / vnto thyrste / vnto col¦de / vnto heete / and vnto many dyuerse maners of sykenesses the whiche ben abydynge for to seche y• more gretter merytes in this worlde yf that it be not by our defaute. And lyke wyse as vnto the sou∣le / he abydeth subget vnto ignoraūce / vnto concu∣pyscence / & vnto malyce sooner than vnto good. By the whiche it is necessary to gyue hym to kepe and conduyte for to prouyde for these inconueny∣ences before sayd. And in as moche the godfader & godmoder ben pledges & maketh good for hym holy chirche them enioyned comenly / to prouyde hym as well vnto the necessyte of the body as of the soule.

But ryght fewe there be the whiche thynke on the soule in techynge them and makynge them to kepe the doctryne and the lyf of holy crystyente. But vnto the contrary vnto them they gyue all euyll exam∣ple. And in so moche that the childe is more incly∣ned to ylle than to good / notwithstandynge the gra¦ce of baptem as soone as he cometh to haue discre∣cyon & vsaūce of vndstandynge / & he fynded hȳ inLata est via q̄  cit ad perdition. the place to chose ye waye vnto helle or to paradyse

And therfore it behoueth yt one watche on them with grete desyre & dyscrecion to the ende that they be put in the ryght pathe &Ubi glosa Pauci¦sūt  iueniāt pau∣ciores  iuentā te∣neāt. paucissimi  in ea {pro}ficiant.

But how shewe the fader & the moder the good waye vnto the childe the whi¦che go themself by the ylle waye.

The answere. In all te werkes of god agay∣neThe answe nature humayne there is mercy and Justyce and euery of them is infynyte. Now is it so that by syn¦neNota q̄tuor mor∣tes.

That is to knowe vnto deth of gylte / vnto deth cyuyle the whiche is to be dampned or exyled from his herytage of his coun∣tree or to be in serage / vnto deth of nature ye whi¦che is separacyon of the body & of the soule / and vnto deth of helle eternall. By the mercy of god infynyte / & the merytees of his blessyd passyon we ben delyuered from two maner of dethes / that is from the deth of yt gylte of synne / & from eternall deth / by suche wyse that we shall kepe vnto Jhesu cryste our redemptour yt yt we haue hym promysed in baptem. But by the dyuyne Justyce & for our grete profyte we shall abyde subiectes vnto two o∣ther maner of dethes. That is vnto ye deth cyuyle. for we be out of paradyse terrestyall ye whiche was our herytage yf synne had not ben / & vnto deth of nature. From the whiche dethes the Justyce dyuyne vs sholde not delyuer / for in so doynge he vs had pryued by a meane for to purchace grete merytes / of the whiche the hyere shall be infynyte. For ofIn patiencia vrā possidebitis aīas vrās. Luce. xxii. as moche as we suffre the more in pacyence and for the loue of god in the exyle of this worlde / our rewarde shalbe ye greter in the realme of paradyse & so it apyreth yt by Justyce we ought to do penaūce
in this worlde. The werke of this artycle after the moralyte is to haue pacyence & makenes in aduer¦syte / be it syknes of body / pouerte / or losse of goo∣des or of frendes / fortune of tyme. Iniuryes / feble∣nesses or temptacyons  For of as moche that ony man suffred the more in this worlde in the estate of grace & in takynge it pacyently for the loue of god / of as moche he hath in hym the more grete token of the loue of god & of saluacyon. For as itQui vult venice pme abneget se∣metipsum & tollat crucē suā & sequat̄ me Mat. xvi. mar¦ci. viii. Luce. ix. hath ben before sayd. The crosse that is to vnder∣stande trybulacyon & aduersyte is the very token where ben the armes of the kynge Jhesus without the whiche there shall neuer persone enter in to ye royalme of paradyse. And in as moche that they ben the more playne & the more grete of as moche is a man sette in the royalme the more honorably & the more nere the kynge. Also the good crysten man sholde take his crosse & hym crucifye in lyke wyse as ye gospell sayth. And it is none other thyn¦ge to saye but that the crysten man sholde resyste and not folowe & obeye vnto the inclynacyons and mouynges of the sensualyte. And that vnto vs is sygnyfyed in that that we saye. Crucifixus. That is to saye that our lorde was crucyfyed for to gyue vs example to suffre & endure for the loue of hym with pacyence. And the poore synner ought not to dyspayre hym / how be it that the sensualyte com∣playned hym an inpacyent / & that he be inclyned & passōned to take vengeaūce / or to do a grete ma∣ny other ylles. So that reason hym holde ferme & stedfast in the fere & loue of god not beynge of con¦sente it for to breke in ferme sensualyte / for as to
suffre suche rebellyons of the sensualyte is not but mater to purchase meryte. Also ought y• good cry∣sten man to be deed & buryed with Jhesu cryst▪ the whiche is none other thynge to vnderstande but that he ought to mortifye his membres / that is hisMortificate m∣bra vestra. sensualyte in kepynge it vnder the rodde & dyscy∣plyne of reason his fyue wyttes of nature / that is to vnderstande the syght / the herynge / the tastyn∣ge / the sauorynge / & the touchynge. He ought also to haue mortefyed & quenched in hym the seculer lyf & worldely / & that is gyuen vs to vnderstande by that that is sayd. Mortuus et sepultus. Our lor¦de deyed in this worlde & was buryed. For otherwy¦se the fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche be∣reth not the fruyte of holy mortyfycacyon. ¶ Here foloweth the .v. artycle the whiche is suche DEscendit ad inferna. tercia die resurrexit a mortuis. That is to saye. I byleue yt Jhesu cryste descended in to helle. That is to wyte the soule vnyed with the persone of the very sone of god as before it hath ben expowned / and the thyr∣de daye arose. The werke of this artycle after the moralyte is that we sholde by holy and fructuous medytacyons descende in to helle durynge this pre¦sent lyf / to the entente that thyder we descende not after the deth by eternall dampnacyon. the whiche thynge our lorde vs wolde shewe. For before that he styed vnto the heuens he descended in to the helles The whiche medytacyons the good crysten man ought to make of the paynes of helle for to clȳme
vnto the heuens it shall be spoken in the last par¦tye of this boke. Also by this artycle we sholde kno¦we the mysery & ryght grete vnkyndnes of humay¦ne condycyon yt we see our lorde for the loue of vs descende in to helle / &  loue of hym we wyll not moūte in to paradyse. Also we sholde aryse frō helle / yt is from the estate of mortall synne on the thyrde daye / that is by contrycyon / confessyon / and satysfaccyon. Fyrst for the loue of god pryncypally Secondely for the desyre of the glorye of paradyse And thyrdely for to shewe ye grete paynes of helle & the tormentes that there ben for euer without en¦de. And therfore the fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche bereth not here this fruyte. ¶ Here foloweth the .vi. artycle. AScendit ad celos sedet ad dexterā dei pa∣tris ōnipotentis. That is to saye. I byleue that our lorde ascended in to heuen the .xl. daye af¦ter his resurreccyon & sette hym on the ryght hande of the fader. Here is to be noted yt how be it our ho¦ly fayth is of thyng{is} ye whiche furmoūten the puys¦saūce & capacyte of naturall vnderstandynge / how be it she conteyned not no thynge impossyble nor contrary vnto reason. And thefore we saye that y• sone of god descended from heuens by his blessyd incarnacyon & styed in to the heuens by his glory∣ous ascensyon / we sholde haue in vs suche dysere∣cyon yt we vnderstande yt to descende & to moūte as vnto the mutacyon of the place may not belonge vnto the diuinyte y• whiche is imeuable & infynyte
But we shall vnderstande that the descendynge is none other thynge to saye but hym to shewe & to present in our nature humayne. And in lyke wyse the moūtyng vnto y• heuens is as in regarde of our humanyte in the person  the sone of god the fa¦der / the whiche by the vertue dyuyne is lyfte vp a∣boue all the heuens / that is aboue all creatures. He sytteth on the ryght hande of god the fader / as vn¦to the dyuynyte it is none other thynge to vnder∣stande but that ye persone of god the sone is egall to god the fader in maieste / puyssaunce / bonte / wy¦sedom & diuinyte. As vnto the humanyte he setteth hym on the ryght hande of god the fader / that is to vnderstande that he is in rest gloryous after his ryght pyteous passyon. On the ryght hande / that is in all the souerayne hyghnesse of glorye and of benedyccyon that euer man may speke or thynke / & as the bonte and puyssaunce dyuyne may gyue. For truely Jhesu cryst very man in body & in soule resonable in vnyte of persone dyuyne is kynge of glorye & of myght egall vnto god the fader & is Juge of the quycke & of the deed. By the whiche it is well sayd he setteth hym on the ryght hande ofQui descēdit ipse ē  ascēdit su{per} oēs celos vt adipletes oia. Ad ephe. . god. For by the ryght hande in holy scrypture vn∣to vs is oftentymes sygnyfyed soueraynte of glo∣rye & of blessydnes in the whiche the blessyd Jhesu cryfte is in humanyte & in dyuynyte. The werke of this artycle after the moralyte is that the true catholyke the whiche stedfastly byleued these thyn¦ges before sayd / ought to haue his herte / his loue / and his desyres on hye / departed from the eithe and from these thynges benethe and transytorye.
That is to saye that he hath not his loue in pry∣de / in¶ nolite dsligere md ne{que} ea q̄ in mūdo sūt  svi ligit mūdū nō ē ca¦ttas pris i eo q oē qd ē i mūdo cō∣cupiscētia carnis ē & cupiscētia ou¦lo & supbia vite.

For no thynge that may be sayd may not better drawe loue / than dooth an other lo¦ue / and therfore he sayth in the gospell. Come vn∣to me all ye the whiche ben in laboure and in pay∣ne / as yf he wolde saye.

These worldely peo∣ple laboure for the worlde pryncypally / and these good crysten men laboure for the lyfe eternall. And therfore euery true crysten man beynge in the labours of this worlde sholde saye by the vertue of the fayth that that saynt Steuen sayd whan he laboured in the artycle of deth & whan he bare theUideo celos a{per}tos & filiū hoīs stantē a dextris tu dei Ac. vu. grete strokes of the harde stones.

Luce. xii he. & ap. x▪ &. xxii. how be it that he agayne sayth not vnto the expo∣stcyon before sayd. And that is suche / that our lor∣de shall come to Juge fyrste the quycke / that is at the Jugement partyculer the whiche is done at the houre of deth of euery man. For mayster Nycholas de lyra sayth in many cases in his doctryne that our lorde cometh vnto ye departynge of euery man
be he good or ylle. Also the pope Innocent sayth that these good men seen hym at the houre of deth vnto theyr grete Joye & consolacyon in example of a noble espouse the whiche sholde receyue his ryght well beloued & faychfull pouse retornynge from a moche ferre regyon.

And the fayth of this artycle is deed the whiche he¦re this fruyte the whiche fruyte is the fere of god & preparacyon to deye well bereth not. ¶ Here foloweth the .viij. artycle. CRedo in spiritum sanctum. That is to saye I byleue in the holy goost. For euery fayth∣full crysten man ought to byleue in one god or in one dyuynyte in thre persones / that is in the fader in the sone / and in the holy goost. And of this a man ought not for to doubte or for to knowe or curyously for to enquyre as afore hath ben sayd. for entendement create is not suffycyent ynough for to comprehende and to vnderstande the myste∣ryes of the blessyd trynyte. But alwayes in these thyng{is} yt he vndstanded he hath some rep̄sentacion
of the blessyd trynyte / for theris not so lytell a crea¦ture but that he hath / vnyte / veryte / & bonte. Also yf he haue admyracyon that one essence of deite be in thre persones of the whhe the one is not the other / as to merueyll h e may haue two natu∣res in one persone / that is in creature humayne ye whiche hath in hym nature corporell / & nature spi∣rytuall / that is body & soule / wherof the one is mor¦tall & the other īmortall in one self persone. Also euery thynge corpprall hath thre thynges / that is the length / the largenes / & the depnes. Also in all the worlde there is but thre maner thynges. The fyrst ben spirytuell all oonly / that is nature ange∣lyke. The seconde ben corporell all oonly / as the foure elementes. The thyrde ben thynges spiry∣tuall & corporall togyder / that is man & woman. Also in the soule / the whiche is vnto the ymage of the blessyd trynyte hath thre myghtes. That is to knowe mynde / vnderstandynge / & wyll / & is not but one soule in the trynyte / & the trynyte in vnyte I byleue than euery crysten man ye persone of the holy goost to be one dyuynyte / one puyssaūce / one maieste with these persones of the fader & of the sone / & that that make the one of these thre perso∣nes as in regarde of the creacyon & of the gouer∣nynge of all the worlde & to glorifye the good & to dampne the euyll is made of all these thre without dyfference. The werke of this artycle as vnto the moralyte is for to meruayll. For as sayth saynt Poule they in whome the holy goost enhabyted by grace habunden in dyuers gyftes. Some haue gra¦ce to speke well & wysely / some other haue vnder∣standynge
& knowlege of many thynges that man may not knowe but by the gyfte of the holy goost & of prophecye. Some other do myracles / some o∣ther suche merytes & vertues by humylyte charyte & mercy in the vertue of the holy goost / the whiche conuerted / moued / and teched & enbrached in loue these humayne bodyes the whiche dyspose them to receyue it & them gyued spirytuall lyf by the whi∣che they profyte in good werkes / they fyght & re∣syste the worlde & the deuyll & vnto theyr inclyna∣cyons sensualles.

So moche more excellently whan the holy goost is in the soule by grace he hȳ gyueth fyue wyttes spyrytuall / by the whiche the soule knoweth meruayllous thyng{is} of god & hym gyueth myght to walke in kepynge the cōmaūde∣mentesBeati īmaculati ī via  ambulāt in lege dnī.

By the whiche it apyreth that of good ryght they be called his cōmaūdementes the pathe & the waye by two reasons. The fyrst for as moche that by the obseruaūce of the cōmaūdemantes god co∣meth & descendeth in to vs in geuynge vs grace. The seconde for as moche as it is the meane by the whiche we go to hym in glorye. ¶Here foloweth the maledyccyons of them that trespassen the cōm̄aūdementes of god. THe maledyccyons of them that trespassenCaplm .iiij. the cōmaūdementes ben infynyte. How be it they may somwhat vnderstande by the opposy∣te of ye benedyccyons beforsayd. For yf they be not punysshed in this worlde temporally by the which punycyon they receyuen true correccyon they shall be punysshed of eternall dampnacyon. And vnto many it becometh that they be punysshed in this worlde and in the other. In this worlde in theyr lyne fals and accursyd the whiche gyueth vnto the fader and vnto the moder desolacyon and sorowe. Also these fruytes of the erthe decay and perysshe oftentymes by lyghtnynges and tempestes of the tyme. And that cometh oftentyme by the trans∣gressyon of the cōmaūdement{is}. Also they vse theyr
bestes where noman puttes ony. Also they falle in dyuerse aduentures of sykenesses as well spyry∣tuell as corporell. Also vnto them cometh warre / by the whiche they be pylled and destroyed wyues / wydowes / childern faderles and moderles / and mannes blood shedde. Also hongers mortalytees / and all other maledyccyons that may be sayd and thought. And all that cometh by the rebellyon that man doth vnto his creatour not kepynge his ho∣ly commaundementes / the whiche he hath gyuen vpon the payne of lesynge goodes meouable and herytages. By these goodes meouable is for to be vnderstande pryncypally the grace of god in this worlde. And by the herytage the realme of parady¦se. Also vpon the payne of lesynge of body and of soule and to be cōdempned vnto the gybet of helle. But symple people make here admyracyon for as moche as they see sensybly and more comenly that they the whiche kepe them worste or leste / they ha∣ue more of worldely prosperyte than they that ke∣pe them / by the whiche they be the lesse ferefull to offende god.

¶ Here foloweth of the cōmaūde∣mentes in partyculer. AS vnto the thyrde poynt the whiche is toCaplm. v. see of euery cōmaūdement in partyculer / it is to knowe that the fyrst cōmaundement is to byleue in god & to put in hym his trust & hym lo∣ue aboue all thynges in seruynge hym deuoutely. In this present cōmaundement be conteyned two thynges / that one is cōmaūded / & that other defen¦ded. By the whiche it is to be noted that where it is so that charyte is the ende & the goodnes & con∣summacyonFinis cepti ē ca∣ritas. Ad thi. . of all the lawe of god / it behoueth to saye that charyte is cōmaunded in euery of the .x. cōmaundementes / the whiche is shewed as well a∣yenst god as ayenst his neyghbour in many and dy¦uers operacyons after the dystynccyon of the com∣maūdementes as it apyreth here after. The thyn¦ge cōmaūded than pryncypally in the thre the fyrst cōmaundementes is charyte ayenst all the blessyd trynyte / the whiche charyte is shewed by humble adoracyon & seruyce all oonly due vnto the fader / vnto the sone / & vnto the holy goost. That adora∣cyon ought to be done of soule & of body / of soule he may not do it nor accomplysshe merytoryously yf he haue not true fayth / hope / & charyte. To the entente than that symple people may haue some knowlege of thse thre vertues without the whiche it is impossyble for to come vnto saluacyon it be∣houeth to saye some thynge in shorte & in generall And for as moche as I haue declared the noblesse and dygnyte of the fayth in the fyrste treatyse I
reste as now to see of charyte. Charyte is a nobleCaritas. vertue moder & nouryce and lyght of these other vertues / by the whiche man loued god aboue all thynges / & his neyghbour as hymself. That is to saye that for to wynne ony good create / be it ne∣uer so grete or for to kepe hym from the lesynge of it man sholde not do ayenst the wyll and cōmaū∣dement of god. For euery persone that kepeth it for the losse of ony thynge / or the gaynes trespassynge ony of the commaundementes of god / he hath no trewe charyte. And yf before that he synned mor∣tally he were in charyte / he it leseth all hole by the whiche losse he is gretely in dammage. For he the whiche was by the vertue of charyte the sone of god by adopcyon / is made the sone of the deuyll of helle by imitacyon and the sone of dampnacy∣on and of perdycyon. He the whiche was in beaute spyrytuall vnto the ymage and semblaunce of the blessyd trynyte is horryble and deformed as a spy∣ryte dampned. He the whiche hadde god the whi∣che is the good infynyte hath all loste in lesynge charyte. He the whiche was the broder of JhesuAmice quō hue in∣trasi no habēs ve¦stē nuptialē. Ma¦the. xxii. cryste enherytour of paradyse and of the holy an∣gelles honoured and praysed / is the seruaūt of the deuyll and of mortall synne / and vnto the deth eternall condempned yf by trewe penaunce he beDe{us} caritas ē &  maner i caritate i deo manet & deus in eo. Jo. iii. not releued. Charyte is the noble robe & lyght of the weddynges of paradyse wherof the soule the espouse of Jhesu cryste is anorned / & without the whiche man shalbe confusedly put out & departed from the company of all those yt be chosen / the whi¦che hath holden & kepte this boke in lyke wyse as
sayth saynt Johan. Who so hath charyte / is with god / & god with hym / and by the vertue & grace of this presence & vnyon of the soule with god & god with the soule cometh the lyf spyrytuall. For so asSicut aia est vita cor{per}is ita de{us} ē vi¦ta aie.

And therfore sayth our lorde in yt gospell he that loueth god & his neyghbour accom¦plysshed all the holy scrypture / & hȳ it suffysed vn∣to saluacyon / & by the consequens he yt offended charyte putteth his soule vnto dampnacōn. TheseA questyon. doctours make a questyon yf a man may well kno¦we of hymself / or of an other yf he haue true cha∣ryte. The answere is yt a man may not knowe byThe answer the waye of nature / but well by ye reuelacōn of god as haue had some holy persones The whiche thyn¦ge is not profytable or necessary of the comen la∣we / to thende that we be alwayes in fere & in me∣kenes. And therfore sayth holy scrypture no man knowed it / that is to knowe by certaynte humay∣ne / yf he be in the loue or in the drede of god. But ony may knowe by some correctours as Saynt Bernarde sayth. Fyrste whan the persone hath dyspleasure of his synnes & of his cursyd & wycked lyf for the loue of god. The seconde whan he hath
ferme purpose for to kepe hym from synne mor∣tallyImor dei nun{que} ē ociosus o{per}atur i magna si ē. grego. in tyme to come. The thyrde whan he fyn∣deth hymself redy & Joyefull in vsynge good wer∣kes. The fourth after some is whan a man here wylfully hereth the worde of god / for the gospell sayth that they the whiche ben of goddes partye he∣ren gladly to speke of hym. And it is a lyke Juge∣mentQui ex deo ē vba dei audit. Io. viii of them the whiche in redynge or in herynge thynges of deuocyon & proufytable vnto the soule fynde sauour & enioye them in theyr spyryte. This noble vertue of charyte shewed hym in these good crysten men without forth / he knelynge & Joynyn∣ge his handes in berynge honour & reuerence vnto the holy sacramentes vnto the relyques & ymages of sayntes / not oonly that a man ought to worshyp the ymages nor to haue hope in ye fayre more than in the foule or vyle. For that sholde be ydolatrye but a man ought to bere reuerence for the honour of the holy sayntes the whiche they represent / who me we sholde knowe for as moche as god theym hath approued by myracles / by vertues / & by holy lyf. Also we sholde bere honour & reuerence vnto the prelates of holy chirche the whiche ben the ad∣mynystratours of the sacramentes. And who soo doth the contrarye by pryde or by malyce is not the true childe of the holy chirche. The thynge defen∣ded in the fyrst cōmaūdement is pryde ayens god & all maner of ydolatrye. The synne of pryde isSuperbia. cōmytted in foure maners. The fyrst is whan the persone byleueth to haue the goodes of the grace of nature or of fortune of hymself & not of god. And that cometh whan the persone is vnkynde ayenst
god of the sayd goodes not yeldynge hym thankes & mercyes. The seconde maner of pryde is whanEusebi{us} in episto∣la de obitu Hiere. Quicū{que} excedit i indumēt{is} vel als mūdh{us} ornamēt su{per}flue & notabili∣ter peccat: {con}tra ca∣ritatē {pro}ximi dāna bilit & deū offēdit & mortaliter & nisi penitēdo se corre∣xerit & talia su{per}fiu a resecauerit: cū diabolo & angelis ei{us} in sēpiternū in ternū vadis. the persone byleued well to haue all goodnes of god / but he that vnderstanded that it is by his me¦rytes pryncypally / whiche thynge is outragyous & presumpcyon detestable ayenst god. The thyrde is in auaūtynge hymself to haue ye goodes spyrytuell or temporell the whiche man hath not / as yf it we¦re to haue connynge vertue or deuocyon. And in so doynge / it is arrogance / iactance / & ypocresye as vnto regarde of the goodes spyrytuell / and vayne glorye as vnto the regarde of the goodes outwarde As be the goodes of fortune. And that pryde is she¦wed in gownes in furres with sleuys with syde lap¦pes or plyted / in cuttynges dysgysed of dyuers fa∣cyons / some naked vnto the sholders or all moost vnto the pappes / in doublettes / in cotes / in gyrdel∣les / in chaynes / in rynges with precyous stones / ex∣cedynge & not apperteynynge vnto the estate of the persone / nor vnto the honeste of holy crystendome And there in he may haue so grete & notable exces & affeccyon so dysordynatly that it is dedely synne And that may come in all estates / be it grete lytel or meane. The fourth maner of pryde is / whan ye persone appetyted dysordynatly / to appere excellēt aboue these other / be it in connynge / in beaute / in strength / rychesse or other goodes. And of that pro∣cedeth errour / ambycyon / vayne glory / inobedyen∣ce vnto his souerayns / rebellyon / syngularyte / in abylymentes / in wordes / & in opynyons / partyna∣cyte / dyscordes / noyses / contencyons / debates / slaū∣dres / & dyuysyons. The whiche thynges somtyme
be mortall synne / or venyall / after the dyuersyte of the circūstances. As oftentymes & as many as pry¦de is cōmytted by delyberacyon & fully consented / it is dedely synne in foure maners beforsayd. And of all these thynges he ought to examen ye persone after his estate & his callynge / be he seculer or of re¦lygyon. Here foloweth of ydolatrye. Ydolatrye de∣fended in the fyrst cōmaundement is cōmytted in fyue maners. The fyrst is that of the paynems ye whiche worshyppe the deuylles. The seconde is of the fals Jewes the whiche yet abyden Jhesu cryste & receyuen the antecryst. The thyrde is of the sar∣rasyns the whiche worshyp Mahonde heretyke & dampned. The fourth is the fals ymagynacyon of these heretykes be they crysten men or other ye whi¦che ayen saye vnto y• fayth of holy chirche the whi¦che is gouerned of the holy goost. The fyfth is of these fals crysten men / & is cōmytted in thre ma∣ners / that is to knowe by pryde / by couetyse / & byHoc a quolʐ coli qd p̄eteris dgi¦tur. Jugustinus. Itē Ambro.

And so it foloweth / who that synned mortally loued not god his crea∣tour perfectly. And for as moche as the lecherous man loued to be honoured & praysed dysordynatly the couytous man loued his rychesse worldely / and the lecherous man his pleasure carnally / ayen the prohybycyon and defence of god his creatour / they make theyr god of these thynges before sayd. For soo as these doctours sayen / the thynge that ony man loued soueraynly / that thynge is his god. By the whiche it appyreth that the ydolatrye of these euyll crysten men prowde men / couytous
men / and lecherous men / is more to be dyspysed / than that of the paynems / and of sarrasyns the whiche well consyderen the hyghnes of the lawe of Jhesu cryst / & the vnkyndnes of these euyll and vnfaythfull crysten men. Take hede than the syn¦ner that wyll examen his conscyence in the whiche is pryncypally his loue / his thought & his desyres / and yf he fynde that there be ony thynge worldely accuse hym as a fals traytour vnkynde and an ydolatrer. Also in lyke wyse he ought to take hede yf he hath ben impacyente of the Jugementes of god / as of the deth of frendes / of the losse of goo∣des / of pouerte / of malyce / of defamynge / of war∣re / or of other trybulacyons. For as saynt Gregory sayth / there may not come ylle of payne in this worlde as ben these thynges abouesayd / where as it is by the wyll and ordynaunce of god. Now it is soo that of the ordynaunce and Jugement of god may no thynge procede but that it be good & well done. By the whiche it appyreth that who so mer∣uayled dysordynatly of a thynge well done / is none other thynge than to contrary & to take god & his operacyons / ordenaūces & Jugementes / the whiche thynge is blasfemynge horryble & detestable. Here than ought the persone to take hede of the synne of murmuracōn / of impacyence / & of dyspayre. Al¦so vpon this cōmaūdement he ought to examen hȳ of all fals byleues / as of sorceryes / of wrytynges / of caracters / of inuocacōns / of deuylles / of diuina∣cyons / of folysshe byleues / vnto ye regarde of the cō¦stellacōns in ye whiche ye childe was borne / of ye son∣ge or cryeng of ony byrdes or metyng of some best{is}
Also yf he be arested in ony dremes in byleuynge that for the dyuersyte of dremes to hym shal come Ioye or desolacyon. Also yf he put trust vnto these bokes reproued / as is the scyence the whiche is cal∣led of the arte inuocatoria or other / in these thyn∣ges there may be mortall synne after the qualyte of the persone & the malyce of the caas & in other dyuers maners the whiche sholde be to longe for to telle / as these doctours them distyncten & determen Also here the persone ought to take hede yf he ha∣ue made ony vowes the whiche by forgetfulnes / by neclygence or by malyce he hath trespassed. Also yf he hath made a vowe a thynge vnlefull to do / or in lettynge of more gretter good / as woman ye make vowes not to kembe them / or not to wasshe them / or not to spynne on some dayes / the whiche ben grete superstycyons & folysshe. And it is to be noted that these bysshoppes / or those vnto whome they haue gyuen auctoryte may chaūge the vowes of theyr subgectes for some good causes & reasona¦ble. Excepte the vowe of chastyte / of relygyon / of of pylgremage vnto saynt Iames / of Rome / & of Iherusalem / the whiche vowes aperteyne all oonly vnto the puyssaunce apostolycall with other yf it please hym them to retayne. Also it is to be noted that as oftentymes as the persone breketh his vo∣we without Iuste & resonable cause as oftentymes he synned mortally. An example / who so had auo∣wedNota. chastyte / & after maryed with intencyon to ac¦complysshe the werkes of maryage synned mortal¦ly in maryenge hym. Also the fyrste tyme that he accomplyssed the dede of maryage he synned mor∣tally
ayen. Also as oftentymes as he accomplys∣shed the dede of maryage by his request he synned ayen mortally. An other thynge it sholde be yf at the request of the partye she yeldeth the deuour of maryage ayen her wyll assoyled. Soo may a man saye of fastynges and other thynges that a man hath auouwed. ¶ Here foloweth the seconde cōmaundement the whiche is suche.Caplm. vi.

The thynge cōmaūded is to accomplysshe our vowes Iustely & lawfully / & to kepe the trouth of the fayth & our holy baptem / vnto the whiche we haue taken & receyued the name of Ihesu cryste or of a crysten man the whiche is a vayne thynge yf we accomplysshe not the werkes of a true crysten man / in kepynge fayth / trouth / & lawfull for the loue of god pryncypally. Of the trouth of ye fayth hath ben before sayd in the treatyse of baptem / wherfore of that vertue it suffysed as now. The thynge defended pryncypally is that a man shall not swere for no thynge / that the thynge the whi∣che is fals be true / or that the trouth be fals / for in that he is forsworne.

And of that abusyon of swerynge sayth the holy scrypture that he the whiche swereth of∣tentyme shall be fulfylled with iniquyte / & shall not longe abyde without the punysshement of god Vnto the transgressyon of that cōmaūdement ben brought the brekynge of vowes & of maryage / the reuelacyon of secretes of an other vnto his grete dāmage and preiudyce. Also in lyke wyse synnen they that swere to make a thynge the whiche is synne or Iniuste of hymself & yet they do it worse in it accomplysshynge. Here is defended pryde ayen god also as in the fyrst. And that is shortly as vn∣to the seconde cōmaūdement. ¶ Here foloweth the thyrde commaundement the whiche is suche.
THou shalt kepe the holy dayes in doyngeCaplm. vij. holy werkes / in the whiche vnto vs is some thynge cōmaūded & the other defended. The thyn¦ge cōmaunded is charyte the whiche is shewed in halowynge. Fyrst hymself in hatynge all dedely synne. And secondely in halowynge the solempny∣te of the holy sondaye & of other festes cōmaūded The whiche is done in reknowlegynge god of the benefytes of the creacyon by souerayne puyssaūce of the redempcyon / by his souerayne wysdome of glorye that he vs promysed / & that he vnto vs hath purchased by his souerayne boūte.

And without suche consyderacyon man may not haue true hope. The lyberalyte of god & the boūte ayen nature humay∣ne appyreth infynytly by that that is sayd in the treatyse of the artycles. But with this consydera∣cyon & lyberalyte of god it behoueth that we con∣syder
our lyf & our werkes. For yf the lyf be confer¦med vnto the cōmaūdementes of god / we ought to hope stedfastly that the Justyce dyuyne vs shall re¦warde after that it aperteyned vnto the lyberalyte of his dyuyne maieste. And yf our lyf & our wer∣kesCarissimi si cor no strū nō rep̄hende∣rit nos fiduciā ha∣bem{us} ad deū vt c∣d prtierim{us} acci∣piemus ab eo qm̄ mādata ei{us} custo∣dim{us} .1. 10. iii. ben other / that is to knowe that they be con∣trary vnto the cōmaūdementes of god / & vnto the vowe made vnto baptem / that sholde be presump¦cyon & not hope / to wene for to come vnto saluacy¦on. By hope a man hath myght & strength ayen the trybulacyons and aduersytees worldely / and bryngeth a man vnto saluacyon. Also it is to be noted that so as there is one fayth infused and put in the soule by the vertue of god. In lyke wyse the∣re is an other founde by study / doctryne / and pre∣dycacyons of holy scrypture. And also a man may saye after these doctours that he may well haue in the persone two maner of hopes and of charyte / that is for to knowe / infused / and purchased / and this suffysed as now of the thre vertues dyuyne / that is fayth / hope / and charyte.

Rancoure is to shewe su∣che indygnacyon by some taken outwarde. Pusil∣lanimyte is to flee the werke of coūsell & of per∣feccyon or fere to take laborous werkes. Vnclennes is a slouth & lachosnes to accomplysshe the cōmaū¦dementes of god. Euagacion of thought is to gy∣ue & occupye hymself with talkynges in folysshe & vayne langage / & to brynge hymselfe here & there vnprofytably or to chaūge his courage from one thynge vnto an other. Dyspayre is somtyme syn∣ne ayen ye holy goost / wherof there are .vi. maners contraryous vnto the .vi. operacyons the whiche the holy goost maketh in the soule the whiche is in the estate of grace. The fyrst operacyon is that he gyued hope of the mercy of god / & ayen that gra∣ce is proprely dyspayre as it was in Cayn & in Ju∣das. And thatt cometh whan the persone byleueth & holdeth that for penaunce / or for prayer that he doth / god wyll not pardon hym / the whiche thyn∣ge is ayen ye infynyte bonte & mercy of god. The seconde operacyon of the holy goost / is to gyue an
holy fere of god in the soule. And ayen that grace is presumpcyon the whiche is in suche wyse to pre¦sume of the mercy of god that ye persone despysed & mystaked his Justyce / as ben a maner of synners dulled the whiche answere vnto them that them re¦preuen that god hath not made them / for to haue them lost. The thyrde operacyon of the holy goost is to gyue & teche the holy trouth necessarye vnto saluacyon. And ayen that grace is impugnacyon of trouth the whiche is whan the persone of certay¦ne malyce ayen sayth vnto the trouth of the fayth & of the cōmaūdementes in dytynge hym to pro∣ue the contrarye vnto the trouth. The fourth ope∣racyon of the holy goost is to gyue ayde vnto the soule by grace dyuyne. And ayen that grace is a dyspleasure of spyrytuell goodnes & of the grace of his neyghbour in repugnynge by certayna ma∣lyce vnto the honour of god / and the vnyon of the membres of holy chirche. The fyfth operacyon is to gyue vnto the soule true correccyon of his syn∣nes. And ayen that grace is obstynacyon & purpo∣se neuer to repente hym of his synne & he is named fynally impenytent. The sixt operacyon of the ho¦ly goost is to haue a ferme purpose neuer to cōmyt¦te thynge that is contrary vnto the honour & holy wyll of god. And ayen this grace is obstinacyon & ferme purpose not to leue or departe hym from ye pleasure that he hath in his synnes / as pryde / coue¦tyse / & lecherye. And it is to be noted that these .vi. maner of synnes beforsayd be sayd inremyssyble / but not in suche wyse but that god may them well pardonne yf the synner wolde do penaunce. For
as saynt Austyn sayth / there was neuer so grete a synner / but that he ought to haue hope of his sal∣uacyon in as moche as god hym hath gyuen lyf. But they ben named inremyssybles / for as moche that full fewe arysen & with grete payne. And to ye entente that a man may lyghtly retorne & compre∣hende the .vi. graces of ye holy goost & the .vi. syn∣nes contraryous they be reputed in suche forme. Dyspayre ayen hope / presumpcyon ayen the fere of god / impugnacyon of the trouth ayen the kno∣wlege of ye trouth / dyspleasure of goodes spirytuell ayen ayde by the grace of god / beynge in purpose to do no penaūce ayen contrycyon of his synnes / beynge in purpose alwayes to contynue in synne / ayen ye purpose to absteyne hym. And this is shor∣tely as vnto the thyrde cōmaūdement. ¶Here foloweth the fourth commaundement the whiche is suche. THou shalt loue thy neyghbour as thyself / &Caplm. viij. pryncypally thy fader & thy moder. In this present cōmaūdement vnto vs is some thynge cō∣maūded / & the other defended. The thynge cōmaū¦ded is charytable to bere honour and reuerence & to do seruyce with herte & with worde vnto our so∣uerayns / and pryncypally vnto fader & vnto mo∣der / the whiche thynge ought to be vnderstande ge¦nerally & specyally. Specyally it ought to be vn∣derstande of the fader & of the moder naturall / al∣so of the spyrytuell / as ben the pope / the bysshop / and the curate. Generally they be vnderstande of
the kynge / of duke / of erle / of baron / of aūcyentes & of them that gyuen good example by theyr lyfe and doctryne & consequently they folowe that cō∣maūdement ayen all the sones and doughters of Adam & of Eue the whiche were our fyrst frendes we sholde honoure in theyr lygne / that is in our bredern & systern in nature hamayne. By the whi∣che it appyreth that in lykewyse as the thre ye fyrst cōmaūdementes of the fyrst table of the lawe ta∣ken vnto Moyses we sholde worshyppe duely by fayth / hope / & charyte ayen the fader / & the sone / & the holy goost. Also this fourth cōmaundement the whiche is the fyrst of the seconde table / contey∣ned in hym vertuously the .vij. werkes of mercy / of the whiche is made mencyon in thyrde partye of this present booke. It conteyned also these .vi. other cōmaūdementes ye whiche folowen / the whi∣che vnto vs be ordeyned duely ayen the vnyuersyte of our neyghbours / the whiche ordynaūce kepte & accomplysshed vnto vs ben necessarye / the foure vertues cardynalles / that is to knowe prudence / force / attemperaūce / & Justyce / the whiche techen and adressen hym & his neyghbour vertuously and morally. Prudence & force ben for to eshewe yre &Prudencia. enuye. Prudence & attemperance for to eshewe glo¦tony & lechery. Prudence & Justyce for to eshewe co¦uetyse. Prudence is a moche noble vertue the whi∣che dyscerned bytwene good & ylle / and the grete with the lytell / and the lytell ylle with the gretter. By the whiche also a man chesed the good & fleed the ylle. This vertue chesed more sooner the gret∣ter good than the lytell / for as nothynge dyscerned
well the whiche chesed not well. By the whiche itSapientia carnis mors ē. ad rom̄. ii. Nō ci ē ista sapiē∣tia desursū descen¦dēs errena alalis & diabolica. Ja. ii. is for to knowe that prudence consydered thre ma∣ner of goodes / & thre maner of ylles / that is to kno¦we the lytell the grete & ye souerayne. These lytell goodes ben they of this worlde. The grete ben they of the soule. And the souerayne ben they of glorye. They than the whiche haue prudence in the lyght of charyte chesen the goodes of the soule / as ben these noble & merytoryous vertues / by the whiche they come vnto souerayne goodes in glorye. But prudence carnall & worldely and deuyllesshe chesed the lytell goodes of this worlde / & lesed the soue∣rayne / & is brought vnto souerayne ylle of helle. Justyce is a noble vertue by the whiche a man gy¦uedJusticia. vnto euery man that that is his. That is to knowe in generall / vnto god obedyence / vnto his neyghbour innocence / vnto hymself clennes of con¦scyence. Innocence is to do nothynge vnto his ney∣ghbour that he wolde not vnto hymself to be done In lyke wyse as by Justyce a man doth well & ple∣sure vnto his neyghbour / by innocence a man ke∣peth hym from offendynge hym. Force is an otherFortitudo. vertue by the whiche a man vndertaketh to do or suffre for the loue of god these thynges stronge & harde. As yf it sholde be to do grete penaūce to en¦tre in to relygyon / to pardonne grete offences / to ouercome his propre inclynacyons / to suffre Iniu∣ryes & passyons. Attemperaūce is a noble vertue y•Tēperancia whiche putteth measure in all these other vertues. and without maner & attemperaūce no vertue is parfyte. Also attemperaūce gouerned the persone in his fyue wyttes of nature / & restrayneth & putteh
measure in all sensuall appetyte. And this is short¦ly of the foure vertues cardynalles. The thynge pryncypally defended in this cōmaūdement is pry¦de & rebellyon ayen our neyghbour / & specyally a∣yen our souerayns / in lykewyse as it hath ben sayd in the fyrst cōmaūdement.

And yf there be mortall exces they ben of god accursyd by sen∣tence of dyuyne scrypture. For fyrst they sholde dye & be stoned of all the people after the auncyent la¦we. Also they come comenly to grete pouerte and mysery by the Juste Jugement of god. Also they ben persecutours of theyr childern. Also they lese all good renowne & be in hatred with all the worl∣de. Also and furthermore they ben in gylte of the synne of the transgressyon of all the lawes / that is to knowe of nature / of dyuyne scrypture / and of lawe Canon / & the lawe Cyuyle / in the whiche la∣wes is cōmaūded & enioyned the honour of the fa¦der & of the moder. By the whiche it behoueth for to conclude that who so doth the contrary is worth of eternall dampnacyon. Also yf they do not theyr deuour ayen theyr frendes that ben deed they offen¦de this cōmaundement / and ben worthy of grete punycyon temporall & spyrytuall. Also those theQui nō dat {pro}pria loco & tp̄e dicet si∣bi in fine discede aledicte &c.

Also it is here wel to be noted that the childern owen vnto theyr frendes many thynges / that is to knowe loue of herte / honour in wordes / purucaunce of thynges necessarye / seruy∣ce and obedyence / supportacyon in theyr defautes and pacyently for to endure yf they gyuen or ma∣ke ony persecucyon / and he that doth the contrary may not be parfyte the obseruytour of this com∣maundement. ¶Here foloweth the .v. cōmaundement the whi∣che is suche. THou shalt slee no man / in this cōmaunde∣mentCaplm .ix. vnto vs is some thynge cōmaunded and the other defended. The thynge cōmaunded is charytably to socoure our neyghbour in kepyn∣ge hym vnto our power in place and in tyme that he renne not or falle not in ony of the foure ma∣ner of dethes the whiche folowen. For as for to co∣me vnto saluacyon it is not all oonly requyred ney¦ther to slee / bete / kylle / or do ony other dyspleasure vnto his neyghbour / but it behoueth of necessyte of the cōmaūdement of god to do vnto hym plea∣sure in tyme & in place in preseruynge his lyfe / & in defendynge hym from the deth. For we sholde not in ony maner wyse what soo euer yt it be / to be
Iniustely the cause of the deth of our neyghbour. As vnto the thynge defended is to be noted that there be foure maner of lyues / & by the consequent foure maner of dethes. For deth is none other thȳ¦ge than the separacyon of lyfe. And for as moche as there ben foure maner of lyues / in lyky wyse a man may fynde foure maner of dethes. The foure maner of lyf is lyf naturall / lyf in substaūce tem∣porall / lyf in helth corporall / lyf in renowne spiry∣tuall. The lyf naturall is vnyon of body & of sou∣le.Vita natura∣lis. Than vnto the lyterall sens / by this cōmaūde∣ment is pryncypally defended manslaughter / that is to be the causer / by dede / by coūsell / by cōmaūde¦ment / by wyll / or otherwyse of the deth of an other vnto thy wyttynge by wrath / or by ylle wyll / and wtout ordre of Justyce. Ayenst this cōmaūdement do these prynces & theyr counsellers the whiche by couetyse or tyrannye meouen warres & bataylles / the whiche they may not do Justely without fyue condycyons. That is to knowe Juste auctoryte / good & pyteous affeccyon in hym ye whiche is Ju∣ged / the whiche batayll and warre he ought to do. Good intencyon & certayne condycyon in hym or them the whiche putteth the warre in execucyon / & that they vnto whome he maketh warre be worthy of punycyon. Ayenst this cōmaūdement doo they the whiche by theyr couytousnes put them in war∣re / for they haue noo good & ryghtfull intencyon. Also the people of the chirche be not of condycyon that they sholde excercyse mortall warre / & to ma∣ke effusyon of humayne blood. For in so doynge they sholde be irreguler & indygne of ye saerament
of hym the whiche hath cōmaunded that a man sholde loue his enmyes. Also ayen this cōmaūde∣ment synne men & women be they in maryage or other wyse the whiche by theyr flesshely & dysordy∣nate indyscrecyon & cursyd goueruynge / or also by malyce / or vnto theyr wyttynge ben ye causers that a woman lefeth her fruyte & that it cometh forth deed. Also as vnto the lyf of substaūce temporall / Vita substan¦cialis. ayen that cōmaundement do those the whiche pyl¦len & stelen taken awaye or wtholde from an other for as moche as is in theym they take from theyr neyghbour the thynge the whiche vnto hym is ne∣cessarye & where with he sholde susteyne his lyfe / by the whiche as vnto that they be ye causers of his deth. And of this sholde well take hede these aduo¦cates worldely & grete pleders the whiche oftenty∣mes make the poore symple for to lese meouables and herytages as ben poore wydowes / childern fa¦derles and moderles & other. For suche theues pyl∣lers ryally may be sayd mordres in as moche as they stele and take awaye from the poore people theyr substaunce and goodes of the whiche they myght haue theyr lyuynge. Also they the whiche by defaute of charyte lete these poore people deye for hongre / or in pryson by defaute of theyr ayde / whan they may and sholde do it. Also as vnto theVita sanita∣tis corporis. lyf of helth corporell / ayen this commaundement do they the whiche stryuen and stryken ayenst the ordynaunce of Justyce in hurtynge ony persone / and in puttynge hym from his good helth. AlsoVita spiritua¦lis. as vnto the lyf spyrytuall ayen this commaunde∣ment done those the whiche hate theyr neyghbou∣res / or
the whiche by coueytousnes or of euyll dys∣posicyon desyre the deth of an other. For holy scryp¦ture sayth who so hated his neyghbour is a man kyller. Wherfore it is to be noted that manslaugh¦terQui odit frem suū homicida . i. io. iii is cōmytted somtyme in courage and wyll all oonly / and not as in dede outwarde. Somtyme it is cōmytted of dede and not of wyll. Somtyme of dede and of wyll togyder. An example of the fyrstNō licet nobis in∣terficere quem{quam}. Io .xviii. The Jewes by theyr Ire and enuye by counseyll and wordes put the sone of god the fader vnto deth without touchynge hym with theyr handes / so as it appyreth by the gospell / in that that they sayen it is not lefull vnto vs for to put no man to deth / in alledgynge theyr holynes and Justyce. And al∣wayes the blessyd sone of god sayd vnto Pylate / Those the whiche me haue betaken vnto the / Qui me tradidit tibi mai{us} peccatū habet. Io .xxix. that is for to vnderstande those bysshoppes / scry∣bes / and the pharysees / haue more greuously syn∣ned than thou. The whiche oftentymes hadde ma¦de shedde his precyous blood by the torment of fla¦gellacyon. By the whiche Ire and enuye may be so greuous that they may be compared vnto man kyllers. So ought a man vpon this commaunde∣ment to examen hym of his synnes the whiche fo¦lowen in a shorte declaracyon. And fyrst of enuye Enuye after saynt Gregory hath fyue braunches That is for to knowe / hatred of herte / susurracy∣on / detraccyon / for to enioye hym of ylle / and for to be sory of his neyghbours welfare. Susurracy∣on is for to speke cursyd langage by malyce for to put noyses in some persones. Detraccyon is for to speke cursyd langage for to take from his neygh∣bour
his good renowne or good name. And ryght often in these two maners there is deedly synne & dampnable / and suche people may not be assoyled without ferme purpose for to restore his neygh∣bour vnto his good name and fame. For as sayth holy scrypture. A good name is more worthe thanMeli{us} ē nomē b∣nū {quam} diuitie le. myllyons of golde & of syluer / and as oftentymes as he hath taken from ony man two pens or fyue shellynges he may not haue absolucyon without restytucyon of dede or in purpose. And for as mo∣che the counseyll of the wyse Salomon is / that as with detractours no man kepe company with wor¦des. For not all oonly to speke detraccyon or susur∣racyon by hate or by enuye of his neyghbour. But with that to prouoke or for to be the cause or hym for to reioyse that suche langage is spoken or wyl∣fully it hereth it is a grete synne and a dampnable And as sayth a glose vpon the margen of this wry¦tynge that by this synne of detraccyon well nygh all the worlde is dampned / and that we may con∣iecte. For I suppose that many confesse them of that synne / how be it they make no restytucyon. And for to see the remedye in that caas there ben many confessours vndyscrete in assoylynge to lygh¦tely. This fals and accursyd synne is cōmytte so∣me tyme in puttynge ylle on his neyghbour the whiche is not true / or whan it is true but by wordes a man it byleued / or whan it is ylle it is secrete a man it shewed ayenst the ordres of charyte / or so whan a man sayth that the thynge the whiche of hym is good hath be done in cursyd intencyon. So¦me tyme in holdynge his pease of the goodnes of
his neyghbour by enuye / and in all maners there may be deedly synne & dampnable / for it is ayenst charyte in takynge awaye or in mynysshynge the good name of his neyghbour. Of the whiche saythCurā habe de bo∣no noīe: hoc eī ma∣gis {per}manebit tibi {quam} mle magni pre¦ciosi thesauri. Ger xli. holy scrypture that euery man ought to haue gre∣te herte & desyre of his good renowne & name. For who so leseth good renowne leseth the loue of tho∣se the whiche hym loueth the whiche is incompa∣rable. Also by the occasyon to do many good dedes & so it is by suche caas many tyme of shame by the whiche he dysposed hym to all ylle. And vnto that it is trewely sayd that he hath more gretter payne for to be helyd of the wounde of the tonge than of the stroke of sworde. And this suffysed as now of the synne of enuye. Here foloweth of Ire. Ire is aDe ira. synne dysordynate to auenge hymselfe vpon ony persone by ony waye and maner ayenst reason and the ordynaunce of Justyce. And it is ayenst the lo∣ue and charyte that a man ought for to haue vn∣to his neyghbour / and by the consequens it is mor∣tall synne of the whiche proceden many braunches after as saynt Gregory sayth. That is to vnder∣stande / indygnacyon / ymagynacyon of hym to be auenged / clamour in wordes / blasfemynge ayenst god & his sayntes / debates & oppressyons. These dyuers maners of Ire may be also vndstande. For Ire may be shewed only in courage & in wyll wtout shewynge it outwarde. And these be the two fyrste braūches / yt is indignacōn & ymaginacōn to auen∣ge hȳ. Where suche Ire is not all oonly in ye wyll / but wt that it is shewed in wordes / & in this ben vn¦derstande the other two braūches / that is clamour
and blasphemynge of god & of his sayntes. A man may also ouer these cursyd courages & these wyc∣ked wordes procede vnto the dede / as to bete & to stryke / or to mysentreate in speche / & other dyuerse maners / & in that ben comprysed these two other membres / that is debat{is} & improperacions. And in all these braūches there may be dedely synne after the affectyon / delyberacyon / & other circūstaunces. Oftentymes also it is but venyall synne vnto the whiche dyfference he ought to take hede of the con¦scyence of the persone by the meane & aduysement of a sage confessour. Of this synne of yre proce∣deth somtyme derysyons / susurracōns / detraccōns & also to curse / the whiche thynges may be mortall synne or venyall synne after the rote & intencyon wherof they proceden. And for to kepe hym yt this passyon of yre procede not vnto mortall synne he ought to warne the persone in two maners after saynt Gregory. Fyrst in consyderynge ye Iniuryes as well of wyll as of worde done vnto god & vnto sayntes / the whiche thynges they haue suffred in grete pacyence. For they knowe well that he were impossyble to be saued ye whiche hath not pacyent∣ly endured. The seconde remedy is that god & his sayntes enduren more of vs without takynge ven¦geaūce of our synnes the whiche we can neuer do of our neyghbour / for ony Iniurye that we knowe to be done. And this is shortely as vnto the fyfth cōmaundement. ¶Here foloweth the .vi. cōmaundement the whi∣che is suche.
THou shalt not be lecherous. Here vnto vs is some thynge cōmaunded & that other de∣fended. The thynge the whiche vnto vs is cōmaū∣ded is charytable prudence by the whiche we haue purchased sobrenes and attemperaūce. By the ver¦tue of prudence we purposen the delytts spyrytual vnto the temporelles and carualles. By this ver∣tue of attemperaunce the creature reasonable ke∣peth hym from to moche drynke and from to mo∣che meete / and also from all dysordynaunce sen∣suall touchynge the synne of lecherye. The thynge defended ben two synnes mortall / that is glotony and lechery. The synne of glotony is cōmytted inDe gula. many maners. Fyrste in etynge at an houre not dewe without appetyte before that the meetes ta∣ken ben dygested / wherof cometh many syknesses the whiche greuen the body and the soule. Secon∣dely by to moche grete desyre for to haue bought precyous meetes the whiche some tyme perteyneth not vnto the estate of the persone. For for to make dyspence in meetes the whiche appertaynen not vnto the persone is a greuous synne. Thyrdely for to ete to haboundauntly by the whiche nature is greued / the whiche is consent with a lytell and complayneth hym of to moche. Fourthly not ke∣pyynge honest maner as for to ete to hastely / the whiche thynge is called deuourynge. And fyfthtly in the maner of the preparacyon of meetes with to moche grete herte / of saltes / of spyceryes / of de∣coccyons / and of confectures. Of that synne co∣men many cursyd bowes or braunches after saynt Gregory. That is to knowe gladnes dysordynat /
wordes carnall vnhoneste / exces of dyuers langa∣ges / vnclennes of body / blyndynge of the entende∣ment. In all these braunches may he haue so gre∣te exces yt he shall falle in dedely synne. Dronken∣nes may come in thre maners without synne / with venyall / and without mortall. An example of the fyrste. Some persone knoweth not the vertue of the wyne and hath grete thorste and drynked after his thorste / it may be that he shall be dronke. Se∣condely. I put caas that the persone knoweth the strength of of the wyne / how be it he weneth not yt it hym sholde surmoūte / for that he hath not ben acustomed / and it may be venyall synne all oonly Thyrdely it may happen that some knowen the myght of the wyne & by experyence of ye incōueny∣ent & yt he is acustomed to be dronken / but he loued better to obeye vnto his apetyte dysordynatly than to kepe hym from the inconuenyences / and than he synned mortally. For vnto his wyttynge he it proued of vsage of reason & greued his body & his soule / & hym dysposed to all ylle / in lyke wyse as a true sobre & abstynet dysposed hym vnto the grace of god & vnto the clerenes of ye intendement. And this is vnto the synne of glotony. THe synne of lechery hath seuen maners / That is for to knowe symple fornycacy∣on / auoutry / coynage / sacrylege / defloracion / vyo¦lacyon / and the synne of sodomyte or ayen nature Symple fornycacyon is bytwene two persones the whiche be not the one ne ye other wtin ye sacramēt of maryage / nor in ye estate of virgynyte / of lygnage /
of gossyprede / in holy ordres nor in the vowe of cha¦styte. Auoutry is whan the one or the other or both tweyne ben maryed with the other partye. In this whan the one or the other ben of lynage or of ony affynyte / or gossyprede. Sacrylege whan the one or the other ben in holy ordres / or haue made auo∣we solemply of chastyte. Defloracyon whan the o∣ne or the other or both tweyne be virgyns. Vyola∣cyon in rauysshynge whan by force & vyolence be she wydowe / virgyne / or maryed is knowen car∣nally. The synne ayenst nature & sodomyte is cō∣mytted in many maners. For the persone reasona∣ble ought to knowe that god & nature defended al maner of touchynges lecherously / in the whiche a man kepeth not the ordenaūce & the maner / & the partyes or membres the whiche ben requyred by reason for to receyue lygne / & so moche the wors it is / whan a man is dysordynate be it in maryage or other wyse in touchynge hymself or another / or beest by vylony & foule pleasure carnall. Who so is culpable of suche synnes may well ynough vnder∣stande his caas by this maner of speche. For other wyse as in generall this horryble synne ought not to be wryten nor openly preched. But the dyscrete confessour may well from the lytell vnto the more grete after the qualyte & circūstaunces of the syn∣ner come vnto the knowloge of the caas / & after to shewe vnto the synner the horryblenes of ye syn∣ne the whiche is so grete that he ought to be punys∣shed after the lawes for to brenne in the fyre / for as moche as this synne cryed afore god vengeaūce for of that cometh hongres / warres / mortalytees /
pestylences / & perdycyons of reames as wytnesseth these holy scryptures. By this synne pryncypally was the dyluuye in the tyme of Noe / & all the worl¦de deyed except. viij. persones. Also for these same synnes felle in to depnes Sodome and Gomorre & thre other Cytees. And now of late ben as ma∣ny of ylles comen / and cometh / & shall come that no man them may wryte or nombre. It happened also as wytnesseth saynt Gregorye / that the leche∣rous persone leseth the clerenes & lyght of vnder∣standynge / & so he is without constaunce / without consyderacyon takynge / without true hope of the delytes of paradyse / and in one affeccyon & loue dysordynate of this present worlde / & of hymself / for alwayes he wolde lyue in the stenche of his syn¦ne. By the whiche it happeneth often that suche le¦cherous people dyspayre them whan the houre co∣meth of theyr departynge / & so they goo vnto the deth eternall. And this is as vnto the synne of le∣cherye & for this the .vi. cōmaūdement. ¶ Here foloweth the .vij. cōmaundement the whi¦che is suche. THou shalt do no theeft. In this cōmaunde¦mentCaplm .xi. vnto vs is some thynge cōmaunded / and the other defended. The thynge cōmaunded is charytable prudence in the lyght of charyte / by the whiche we haue consyderacyon of the greate dyfference the whiche is bytwene the goodes erthe∣ly and the goodes of glorye. By this dyfferece and knowlege we dysprayse and repute as nought all
felycyte worldely in comparyson of the very bles∣sydnes. And in lyke wyse by this consyderacyon we ben enclyned & induced to do Justyce the whi∣che is none other thynge as now / but for to yelde vnto euery man that that vnto hym apperteyneth as it hath ben sayd before & shall be more playnly in spekynge of restytucyon. The thynge the whi∣che is defended by the cōmaūdement is the synneDe auaricia. of couetyse. Couetyse is an appetyte dysordynate of goodes transytorye & temporall what soo euer they be. This synne is cōmytted generally in thre maners / yt is to knowe in gettynge to moche bren∣nyngly / in retaynynge to streytely & in dyspendyn¦ge to scarsely. And for as moche sayth saynt Poule that the coueytous man is an ydolater & a seruy∣tour of the deuyll. Wherfore it is to be noted that a deuyll named Māmona made vnto the coueytous man. vi. cōmaūdementes. The fyrst is that he ke¦pe well his golde & his syluer or other goodes. The seconde is that he lese not in his handes. The thyrde is that he encrease them from daye to daye The fourth is that he gyue no thynge in almesse nor other wyse. The fyfth is that he lene not nor doo noo pleasure / for in soo doynge he putteth his goodes in peryll. The sixte is that he shall restray¦ne hymself & his housholde from meete & drynke for to spare his goodes. Of this synne cometh & procedeth seuen doughters or braunches after as sayth saynt Gregorye. That is for to vnderstan∣de treason / fraude / begylynge / periurynges / rauay¦ne / desyrous for to gete / hardynes of body ayenst the poore and many other euylles. Here is defen∣ded
all euyll marchaundyse / euyll laborynges and werkes to fayne hym in his Journey / and to selle fals ware for good. I put caas that the seller hath ben dysceyued in byenge them for good / for one dysceyued ought not an other for to dysceyue. Here is defended theeft / vsery / rauayne / symony / sacry∣lege / fals spekynge / fals swerynge / and generally all decepcyons openly or pryuely / by the whiche a man maketh the losse of an other his owne or els that a man wolde not reasonably vnto hym to be done. Also all contractes and other thynges in the whiche it behoueth▪ For to make restytucyon of the whiche shall be treated in partyculer in the fourth partye. And this is in generall and in short as vn¦to the .vij. cōmaundement. ¶ Here foloweth the .viij. cōmaundement the whi¦che is suche. THou shalt bere no fals wytnes. In this cō∣maundementCaplm .xij. vnto vs is some thynge com¦maunded / and the other defended. The thynge whiche is cōmaunded is the contrarye and the op∣posyte of that the whiche is defended. To bere fal¦se and cursyd langage is contrarye vnto charyte / the whiche we sholde haue ayenst our neyghbours By the whiche it appyreth that it vnto vs is com∣maunded to saye well to magnyfye and to exalte the good and the honour of our neyghbours and in praysynge god charytably in place and in ty∣me / the whiche thynge we accomplysshe by the ver∣tue of prudence & of force illumyned with charyte /
for so doynge & desyrynge the good & honour of our neyghbour to be our honour / in lyke wyse as requyreth the vertue & nature of charyte / the whi∣che is to loue his neyhbour as hymself / & the whi∣che maketh all goodes to be comyn. Than by good prudence we shall exalte & augment our welth & our neyghboures. And by that vertue of force we hym sholde purchase good and honour in berynge hym good wytnes in place & in tyme & in defen∣dynge hym to our power & his good renowne. And this is in short as vnto ye thynge cōmaūded. The thynge defended / is fals wytnes. That is to saye cursyd langage procedynge of Ire & of enuye / & in lyke wyse as Ire & enuye ben defended in the .vi. cōmaūdement pryncypally in as moche as the she∣we them by werke / in lyke wyse they ben defended in the .viij. in as moche as they it shewen by cursyd langage. For as a man may noye his his neygh∣bour in dede / in lykewyse a man may noye hym in worde. And they that may not of dede oftentymes they do it by cursyd langage / ye whiche is cōmytte in dyuers maners. For as sayen these doctours & the holy scryptures in the operacyon of the tonge is the deth or the lyf. And therfore wolde the bles∣sydIn manib{us} lingue more & vita. holy goost hym shewe & appyre in the lykenes of tonges of fyre for to gyue vnderstandynge that yf the tonge be not purged and gouerned of the holy goost / it is an harde thynge but that it be go∣uerned of a cursyd spyryte. That is the deuyll the whiche by the meane of the tonge serpentynously putteth all humayne lynage vnto perdycyon / and the whiche gouerneth and ledeth theym that ben
replete with Ire and enuye / and them aydeth with theyr tonges as with glaynes cuttynge. And ther∣foreLingua o glad us acutus. . sayth the Psalmyste / that the tonges of syn∣ners is the glayne of the deuyll / sharpe and full of venym. And after these doctours .xij. synnes proce∣den of the tonge / the whiche may be mortall or ve∣nyall after the dyuers circumstaunces and inten∣cyon of the synner / as ben blasphemynge / periu∣rynges / lesynges / boostynges / murmuracyons / de∣traccyons / wordes carnall and vnhoneste / folysshe langages / talkynges / Jangelynges / and many o∣ther euylles the whiche ben shewed / as wytnesseth the conscyence of suche people to be horryble and detestable. For as our lorde sayth by the wordes ofLoquela tua ma∣nifestum te facit. Mathei. xxvi. Qui de terra ē de terra lo. Io. ui. a persone a man may some what haue knowlege and Juge of the wyll and of the conscyence. Of de¦traccyon of dyuers maners for to lye and of fals wytnes in Jugement shall be spoken in the fourth partye. And this is in generall and in short as vn¦to the .viij. cōmaundement. ¶ Here foloweth the .ix. cōmaundement the whi∣che is suche. THou shalt not desyre an other mans wyf / AndCaplm .xiij. in lyke wyse the wyf sholde not desy∣re the man / that is to knowe by cursyd concupys∣cence. But well may the one the other desyre with out synne by good and Juste affeccyon of marya∣ge. In this present commaundement vnto vs is some thynge commaunded / and the other defen∣ded. The thynge commaunded is the vertue of
chastyte and clennes of spyryte and of wyll in the vertue of holy charyte / that is to knowe for the lo¦ue of god and of the saluacyon of our soules / the whiche vertue of charyte we sholde haue and pro∣cure as well in vs as in our neyghbours. And vn∣to that we may come by the vertue of prudence and of force after the maner of forme declared in the .vi. commaundement. The thynge defended in the sixte is all concupyscence by consent dyspo∣sed out of maryage. and I put caas yf that suche cursyd ylle wyll is not shewed outwarde in effecte neuerthelesse notwithstandynge yf it soo be / it is deedly synne. For as our lorde sayth in the gospellOs  viderit mu¦lierē ad cupiscen dū eā tam mecha∣tus ē in corde suo. Mathei. v. who so euer hath concupyscence carnall of the wo¦man / or the woman with the man with consente dysposed offended the commaundement of god. By the whiche it foloweth that all vnhoneste kys∣synges / touchynges / lokynges / wordes / lettres / gyf¦tes / promysses / abylymentes / countenaunces / and many other ylle cursyd dedes pryncypally for the entente for to drawe ony persone vnto the consent of concupyscence of the synne of lechery / it is de∣dely synne / for the wyll all oonly is deedly synne / as it is sayd. And therfore the wyll the whiche is shewed by ony of these tokens before sayd / it is more greuous than yf he abyde stedfast inwarde of the wyll. And this is in short as vnto the .ix. cō¦maundement. ¶ Here foloweth the .x. cōmaundement the whi∣che is suche.
THou shalt not desyre an other mānes goo∣desCaplm. xiiij. vnto his hurte & ayenst the ordynaūce of Justyce & of reason. In this present cōmaunde∣ment vnto vs is some thynge cōmaunded / & the o∣ther defended. The thynge cōmaūded is the vertue of lyberalyte ayenst our neyghbours. The whiche vertue is excercysed by the vertue of true prudence & of Justyce enformed with charyte / as it is sayd in the .vij. cōmaūdement. In this present cōmaū∣dement may be vnderstande the seuen werkes of mercy. To desyre than to gyue of his goodes by loue & by charyte vnto vs is here cōmaunded. And yf a man may not do it in werke / the good desyre of the wyll suffysed before god for to be gretely re∣warded / as the desyre for to do ylle is worthy to be dampned. The thynge defended is concupyscen∣ce & couetousnes of thynges temporell or the dam∣mage and preiudyce of an other. For in lyke wyse as in the fourth / in the fyfth / in the sixte / and in the seuenth commaundementes vnto vs is defended / for to do ylle / dysplesure / or vylony vnto our neygh¦bour by ony maner of operacyon. And in the .viij. vnto vs is defended the offence of wordes. In lyke wyse in the .ix. and also in the .x. vnto vs is de∣fended the cursyd wyll for to do vnto hym hurte / o vylony by concupyscence carnall or other wyse / In the whiche it appyreth clerely that who so euer hym wyll gouerne by the rule of the .x. commaun¦dementes / shall be well and Justely ordeyned as well ayenst god as ayenst his neyghbour / be it in dede / in worde / or in wyll. Also it appyreth that in euery commaundement be it affyrmatyf or elles
negatyf / there is some thynge commaunded / and the other defended. For god neuer cōmaunded for to do ony thynge but that he forbade the contrary nor not defended ony thynge but that he cōmaun∣ded his contrarye. ¶ Here foloweth the epylogacyon or short repety∣cyon of this seconde partye. FOr to vnderstande the better & retayne the∣seCaplm. xv. thynges beforesayd they ben recapyteled & enployed in suche maner. In the fyrst cōmaūde∣ment of the lawe is cōmaūded humble adoracyon of the dyuyne maieste / & ydolatrye defended & all pryde ayenst the maieste dyuyne. In the seconde / confessyon of the trouth in worde and in dede is cō¦maunded / and all periurynges and cursyd othes defended. In the thyrde / loue vnto the dyuyne boū¦te vnto vs is commaunded / and vndeuocyon and foulnes of spyryte vnto vs is forboden. And by su¦che wyse in accomplysshynge these thre commaun¦dementes we be ordeyned ayenst all the blessyd try∣nyte. For vnto the fader is attrybute dyuyne ma∣ieste / and vnto the sone infynyte veryte / and vnto the holy goost souerayne bounte. And therfore to the entent that we haue dysposycyon to byleue / to confesse / & to loue this blessyd trynyte the thre ver∣tues theologyes that is fayth / hope / & charyte / they ben create of god in the soule the whiche worthely receyueth the holy sacrament of baptem. Charyte for to loue god the fader / fayth for to gyue kno∣wlege and for to aduowe the trouth of god the
sone / and hope for to confesse hym in the boūte of the holy goost. In the fourth cōmaundement ho∣noure / reuerence / loue & pyte vnto vs be cōmaūded & pryncypally ayen fader & moder / & consequently ayenst euery creature humayne / & all rudenes cru∣elte / & vnfaythfulnes ayenst our neyghbours vn∣to vs is defended. In the fyfth swetnes & benyg∣nyte ayenst our neyghbours vnto vs is cōmaūded. In the sixte chastyte & clennes / in dede & in worde vnto vs is cōmaūded / and all lechery by ony ma∣ner what so euer it be vnto vs is defended. In the .vij. lyberalyte in departynge resonably the goo∣des of this worlde necessarye vnto our neyghbour is cōmaūded / and all rauayne & coueytousnes is enhabyte. In the .viij. trouth in wordes be it in Jugement or otherwyse vnto vs is cōmaūded / and lyenge / disceyuynge / defamynge / mockynge / or ab∣usynge vnto vs is defended. In the .ix. chastyte in thought / in desyre / & in poorenes of spyryte vnto vs is cōmaūded / & all foule thoughtes & carnall desyres vnto vs ben enterdyted & defended. In the .x. to delyre coueytously the goodes transytory vn∣to vs is defended / and good desyre of power for to accomplysshe the werkes of mercy in place and in tyme / that vnto vs shall be possyble / and of rea¦son vnto vs is cōmaunded. And by these. vij. the laste cōmaundementes we ben perfectly & Justely ordeyned ayenst our neyghbours in two maners / that is in kepynge vs from offendynge them / and in doynge vnto hym in place and in tyme pleasu∣re and seruyce. In these two poyntes / that is forDiuerte a malo & fac bonū. p̄s. xxxiii to knowe / to flee the euyll / and to do the good is
comprehended all parfeccyon of Justyce as saythMinus  mala n agere nisi etiā s{que} stude at & bonis o∣{per}ib{us} insudare Gre¦go. in sermone. holy scrypture. Kepe the from doynge ylle vnto thy neyghbours / and enforce the for to do vnto hym good and pleasure. For in lyke wyse as saynt Gre¦gory sayth. It suffysed nor for to seche saluacyon / not to cōmytte ony ylle nor synne / but it behoueth for to excercyse hym in good werkes in place andSi vis ad vitā in∣gredi serua māda a. Math. xix. Qui offenderit in vno fact{us} est oīm eus. Ia. ii. in tyme the whiche is of necessyte. Than he that wyll be saued / hym behoueth necessaryly for to ke∣pe all these .x. commaundementes. For god by his Justyce ordeyned may not dyspence nor doo other wyse. For he hath assented that who so wyll come vnto saluacyon / hym behoueth that he kepe and that he accomplysshe all these .x. commaundemen¦tes. For as saynt James sayth in his Conon. He that trespasseth one of these commaundementes synned mortally / and breketh all the lawe. Of the whiche brekynge Jhesus soucrayne vertue vs wyl∣leth for to kepe / and the true entendement of his lawe and of his holy cōmaundementes vs inspyre and them for to accomplysshe by true fayth / hope / and charyte / vnto the whiche alwaye laketh it / the fader / and the sone / and the holy goost vs ayde Amen. ¶After the declaracyon of the .x. cōmaundemen∣tes of god / here folowen the .v. cōmaundementes of holy chirche.
¶The fyue cōmaundementes of holy chirche. ¶On the sondayes thou shalt here masse and the festes of cōmaundement. ¶Of all thy synnes thou shalt be confessyd / at the leest one tyme of the yere. ¶And thy creatour thou shalt receyue / at Eester humbly. ¶These festes thou shalt halowe / that ben gyuen the in cōmaundement. ¶The foure embres vigyles thou shalt faste / and the lente entyerly.
OVer the .x. cōmaundementes of god beforeCaplm .xvi. wryten our moder holy chirche hath put to fyue.

Missus people be boūde after the forme & maner that ho∣ly chirche entendeth to bynde her subgectes. The fyrst is yt on the holy sondaye & other grete festes & solempnytees gyuen by cōmaūdement after dyuer syte of y• coūtre & of the dyoces euery man the whi∣che hath age & dyscrecyon ought to here masse en∣terly yf he haue no lettynge nor excusacōn reasona¦bleOis vtrius{que} sex{us} cū ad ānos discre∣tiōis {per}uenerit oia sua simul petā sal∣tē semel i āno fide lit {con}fiteat {pro}o sa∣cerdoti & iniunctā penitēciā sibi {pro}is vitib{us} studiat adi∣plere suscipiēs re∣uerēter ad min{us} i pascha eucharistie sacramentū &c. ex∣tra de pe. & re. ca. Omnis. by ye whiche of yt he may be excused. The secon∣de cōmaūdemēt is yt he ought to be confessed / at the lest one tyme of the yere vnto y• preest yt hath aucto∣ryte to assoyle hym / in lyke wyse as it apyred by ye statute & ordynaūce of holy chirche. To confesse hȳ many tymes in ye yere / as haue of good & holy cu∣stome many good & faythfull crysten men / it is of coūseyll & not of cōmaūdement / except some cases partyculers the whiche ben here after put & decla∣red in the treatyse of confessyon. The thyrde cō∣maūdement is that all persones the whiche hath wytte / age / & dyscrecyon competent after the Juge¦ment & good coūseyll of his curate or other confes¦sour ought to receyue ye holy sacrament of the aw∣ter at the tyme of Eester trewely confessed & repen¦taūt of all his synnes the whiche he hath cōmytte in his lyf / and of the whiche he may haue remem∣braūce after the fragylyte of intencyon humayne. The fourth cōmaūdement is to kepe the feestes yt be gyuen in cōmaūdement / in halowynge theym. And for to do it the better a man ought to cesse of all werkes of synne erthely and seruyle the whiche
may lette the spyryte to retorne vnto god / & vnto hymself in tyme and place as holy chirche hath or deyned. And it ought to be vnderstande / yf necessy∣te lfull hym enforce none other wyse. In lyke wy∣se it hath ben declared before in the thyrde cōmaū¦dement of the lawe. The fyfth cōmaundement of holy chirche is that euery persone the whiche hath passed the yeres of one and twenty ought for to faste foure tymes in the yere the Embrynge tyme.De quatuor tē{per}i∣b{us} habet di. lxxvi. ca Jeiuniū & ca. cō¦stituim & ca. de xl. di. v. ca. q̄dragesi∣ma.

Vnto these fyue cōmaundementes vs byndeth holy chir∣che vnto the whiche we sholde obeye as vnto god / For he hath sayd that they the whiche obeye vnto the prelates of holy chirche hym doth obeye / and they that them dysobeye hym dysobeyeth. By the the whiche it appyreth clerely ynough that they the whiche trespassen these cōmaundementes be∣fore sayd synnen mortally yf cause resonable them excuse not in all or in parte. ¶Here foloweth of two maner of lyues the whi∣che ben in holy chirche. That is to knowe of the lyf actyf and the lyf contemplatyf. AS wel for these thynges spoken as for the∣seCaplm. xvij. thynges the whiche folowen is well for to be noted that holy chirche is comprysed in two estates. That is to knowe in the lyf actyf and in
the lyf contemplatyf the whiche vnto vs ben well sygnyfyed by two women the doughters of one fa¦der & of one moder / that is Martha and Mary mawdelayne dwellynge in one house the whiche chose our blessyd sauyour Jhesu cryste for to lodge there and enhabyte. The lyfe actyfe is the lyfe as of them that ben worldely the whiche vnto vs is sygnyfyed by Martha / the whiche was desyrous to lodge our lorde and his apostles / and to aparell them and to gyue them refeccyon in betokenynge that they of the lyfe actyfe ought for to excercyse them in the werkes of mercy corporall. The lyfe contemplatyf is the lyf of holy relygyon / and that vnto vs is sygnyfyed by Mary mawdelayne the syster of Martha / the whiche was at the feet of our lorde herkenynge ryght swetely the ryght ho∣ly doctryne of our lorde the whiche is the brede and the refeccyon of the soule. By the whiche it appyreth that the lyf contemplatyf excedeth in va¦lour and in dygnyte the lyfe actyfe / in as moche as the soule is more noble than the body / and the werkes of mercy spyrytuall ben more noble than these werkes corporall. For in lyke wyse as the ex∣cercyse and occupacyon of the actyfe is ayenst the body. In lyke wyse the occupacyon of the lyf con∣templatyfe is pryncypally ayenst these necessytees and for the prouffyte of the soule. But not with∣standymge that the lyfe contemplatyfe is more hygher and more noble / she is not the lesse peryl∣lous. For as moche as the estate is more hygher / the falle or the defaute that a man there in may do is the more greuous. And therfore may a man
saye that euen in lyke wyse as the ryche worldely man of the lyfe actyfe is in payne and in thought for to gette and to augmente goodes temporall▪ fyrst for the necessyte of hymself and of his / and folowynge for to gyue and to departe vnto the po∣re in place and in tyme after good prudence and that is the commaundement of god vpon the pay¦ne of deedly synne / and by the consequent vpon the payne of dampnacyon. In lyke wyse the per∣sone relygyous and contemplatyfe consyderynge his pouerte and indygence spyrytuall and other necessytees without nombre as well in hymselfe as in his neyghbours enforced hym and laboured to socoure vnto the one and vnto the other / and of as moche as these dyuersytees as well corporall as spyrytuall ben the more gretter / of as moche gro∣weth the payne and the thought in y• soule of the trewe relygyous man charytable and contempla∣tyfe. Alas it is well vnderstande and consydered so many we see of the blynde / of meselles / the hal∣te / the lame / croke backed / foule and mysshapen / the whiche well vnderstandeth by the sykenesse of the body / and than that of the soule is moche mo¦re greuous and also moche more for to be play∣ned and redoubted than these sykenesses corpo∣rall in as moche as the soule is a more gretter thynge than the body. And as now vnto the pur∣pose who is more blynder than he the whiche gy¦ueth or that leseth paradyse for to purchase helle / Also who is more rotten or stynkynge / and detesta¦ble before god and before all the courte of heuen than ye myserable synner / swollen by pryde / rotten
foule / & stynkynge / by the synne of lecherye / wron∣ge / crockyd / & myshappes by the synne of couetyse of Je / & of enuye / & so of other synnes / in the whi∣che the soule is ordeyned as well ayenst god as a∣yenst his neyghbours / and also as broken and put out from the lygne & ordynaūce of nature. And for as moche he that loued his neyghbour as hymself & hym seeth spyrytually in suche aduersyte of syn∣ne dampnable the whiche is the waye & the danger of eternall dampnacyon may not haue in his spy∣ryte gladnes nor reste. But yt behoueth that of as moche as he loueth his neyghbours more or lesse / that of as moche / he is pyteous / heuy / and sorow∣full of the grete ylle and excessyue foly of his fren¦de. By the whiche appyreth the labour and pyte∣ous thoughtes of the true contemplatyf / the whi∣che seeth and consydereth all moost all the worlde out of the waye and go vnto perdycyon. It appy∣red more ouer that as well in the lyf actyf as in the lyf contemplatyf / he hath grete and peryllous la∣boure vnto whome well and merytoryously he wyl do his deuour / and that of good ryght / for payne thought and labour is the meane for to come vn∣to the reame / vnto the whiche these blessyd be co∣me in doynge hymself vyolence and by harde gre∣te and stronge trybulacyons. And this vyolence dooth the ryght trewe contemplatyf in hymblyn∣ge hymself truely & in repentynge hȳ & all his wer¦kes power and of no valoure. For yf ony goodesA dieds ohāi e celo{rum} vim pati & violenti ra¦pit illud. Math .x. there were founden he ought for to knowe verely that suche goodes cometh not of hymselfe but of the oonly bounte dyuyne the whiche is the fontay∣ne
of all perfeccyon / and in suche wyse humblyn∣ge hym truely he feleth in hymself all mysery and imperfeccyon there is grete vyolence specyally in those worldely people the whiche begynne for to do well / as it is for to make restytucyon vnto an o∣ther requyrynge pardonne / for to humble hym in ntrynge in to relygyon or in betakynge other tre∣we wayes of penaunce. For it is a thynge naturall vnto a creature reasonable for to desyre honour / glorye / and gladnes / pleasures / and all other excel∣lentes and perfeccyons as well of the partye of the body as of the soule▪ But suche is the condycyon of this valey of mysery the whiche by humylyte it behoueth to come vnto honour / for to be vyle and dysprayse voluntaryly it behoueth to come vnto the glorye the whiche is without ende. By contry∣cyon / sorowe / and pyte / dysease / compassyon / and mortyfycacyon / man hath purchased Joye / glad∣nes and lyf eternall. And so all other thynges that may be sayd or thought of the one the contrarye behoueth for to come vnto the other. For it is im∣possyble after the ordynaunce dyuyne for to haue paradyse in this worlde and in the other in comyn¦ge from Joyes / gladnesses / pleasures / and delytes worldely vnto the Joye and vnto the reame of pa∣radyse. By the whiche a man may well vnderstan¦de / as for to lyue he muste deye / for to haue Joye / he muste wepe to haue all goodnes for euer / hym behoueth for to renounce vnto hymself / that is vn¦to his sensualyte vnto his desyres worldely natu∣rall / and all other goodes wordely and temporall / and for to take and enbrace hertely holy pouerte of
spyryte aboue all the goodes worldely and tempo∣rall. And by these thynges beforsayd may a man clerely vnderstande the errour & foly of these worl∣dely pople the whiche with all theyr power sechen the felycyte worldely / for it is none other thynge to saye or to do but for to flee and renoūce vnto the beatytude eternall. Also may a man well vnder∣stande that this meruayllous mutacyon and wer∣ke of god whan the persone vayne and worldely hym conuerteth and retorneth for to take the waye of paradyse the whiche is penaunce / and that in so doynge hath grete vyolence as it is sayd. Also the persone contemplatyfe the whiche by the grace ofA Cagitta volante in die a negocio {per}∣ambulāte in tene∣bris eb cursu & de monio meridiano Psalmus. xc. god is trewely propred of all his desyres and plea¦sures vayne and worldely / ought soueraynly for to watche and for to kepe hym from the darte that the deuyll casteth subtylly / and ryght vnpyteously in the houre of myddaye / that is the synne of pre∣sumptuous thoughtes or vayne glorye that he bryn¦geth vnto the creature by the reason o holy estate of graces spirituell and good werkes the whiche of that maken a maner of lyght spyrytuall / and therfore they ben lykened vnto the houre of the myddaye / but oftentymes they ben the occasyon of pryde and of ruyne who is not ryght strongely armed with humylyte / and the whiche hath not before hym the bockeler of the f of god. And vn¦toBeda. that purpose sayth the honourable Beda / that for the grete gyftes / graces / and reuelacyons that god hath made vnto saynt Poule. He was fallen in pryde and in vayne glorye / notwithstandynge his grete and synguler scyence yf god hath not
letted the deuyll for to tempte hym moche horry∣bly / and that / yf that temptacyon had not be / by the whiche he was in fere and in mkenes he had ben fynably dampned. And therfore sayth well Isydore that the persone the whiche chaunged theIsidors. estate and lyfe from ylle vnto good / or from good vnto better / he ought soueraynly to take hede that the vayne glorye of his estate / of hie graces / and of his vertues make hym not falle more lower and more greuously than he was by his grete vyces & synnes. Also he sayth more ouer that for noblenes of estate / for connyge / for force / or other goodes of nature or of grace noo man ought for to truste in hymself or to gloryfye. For Lucyfer surmounted all erthely creatures in all gyftes and perfeccyons of nature / and neuertheles by his pryde and folys∣she thynkynge is torned and fallen in to eternall dampnacyon. Also Adam fauted moche greuously Salomon with his grete scyence. Dauyd with his holynes / sayn Peter with his hardenes and with his stedfastnes / many Heremytes and Relygyous of grete & excellent perfeccyon ben fynably fallen / and all comenly by folysshe thoughtes & presump¦cyon of theyr estate. And therfore sayth saynt Au∣stynAugustinus. that more it pleased vnto god the persone the whiche of synnes maketh humble confessyon than of hym the whiche of his graces & vertues hym gy¦ueth vnto pryde & presumpcyon. And this vnto vs is declared in the gospell by the example of the pub¦lycaneLuce. xviij. the whiche was a man mylcheuous and worldely / and of the pharysee of grete relygyon / of the whiche the synner publycane humbled hymself
before god in sayenge and cryenge that he was not worthy for to lyfte vp the face ayenst the sye / and the pharysee hym gloryfyed in bryngynge in to his mynde how oftentymes he fasted / he payed the demes / he gaue almesse and many other good dedes / by the whiche he Juged in hymself that he was moche better than these other / and that he resembled not vnto these synners worldely. And by suche pryde and boostynge he was by the sen∣tence of Jhesu cryste reproued and condampned / and the poore publycane by his contrycyon and hu¦mylyte approued and Justyfyed. ¶ Here folowen thre reasons by the whiche we may be enduced to fere and to mekenes. HOr to holde hym in fere and mekenes with¦outCaplm. xviij praysynge hymself or grauntynge vn∣to ony vayne glorye for the estate of perfeccyon / or ony other vertues or merytes. Here folowen thre reasons taken and drawen out of the booke of lyf of Jhesu cryste by the whiche well comprysed and vnderstande the spyryte deuoute and contempla∣tyfe may take grete meruayllous strength ayenst his enemye the deuyll his aduerarye and feruour to prouffyte from good vnto better. The fyrst rea¦son is that yf we consyder afte our lytell power the hyghnes infynyte of the dyuyne maieste / his wysdome / his bounte / his honour / and his puys∣saunce / and these other perfeccyons infynyte the whiche ben in god / by the whiche he is worthy to be honoured / serued / fered / and loued. We knowe
clerely that all that that we may do / saye / or thyn∣ke in regarde of these thynges abouesayd / is lesse tha nought / as is of our parte. And therfore to pryde hym for suche seruye or ony good werkes it is a grete folye / and after some thynges more gre∣ouser and vnto god more dyspleasure than the pryde of Lucyfer. The reason of good ryght is the fyrste for as moche as all our werkes ought to be done pryncypally for the honour and glorye of god. The seconde reason is that yf we consyder the mekenes of our lorde Jhesu cryst the Jniuyes and reproues / and the paynes & labours / and fynally the deth & ffusyon of his precyous blood / and how he hath all swetly borne & endured more than ony vnderstandynge creature may speke or thynke / and how all that he hath pryncypally endured to the entente that he may haue the lawe of our her∣es / for the whiche loue vnto vs yet he wyll gyue by his ryght abondaūt grace hymselfe / his glorye / and his reame. We see clerely that all our good werkes in comparyson of soo ryght grete & payn∣full passyon and of the grete goodes of glory / whe¦re in we truste ben lesse than nought. This reason of good ryght vnto the seconde / for as moche that she touche more hyer & incompreuable mater as these he whiche folowen / as is the passyon of Jhe∣su cryste and of the glorye of paradyse. The thyr∣ reason is that yf we consyder the innocence and the perfeccyon that we haue promysed and vowed vnto holy baptem / the whiche we sholde holde and kepe before god / as is his cōmaundement to loue hym with all our herte / with all our thought / and
with all our myght and vertues. Also our neygh∣bours as our selfe. And also that for to please our blessyd creatour we sholde be annorned with all vertues / as is fayth / hope / charyte / humylyte / pa∣cyence / obedyence / chastyte / and so of all other ma∣ner of vertues We fynde in a dystaunce / also as in∣fynyte and in the depe dyche of vnkyndenes and of all imperfeccyn. The fourth reason is that yf we consyder the grete graces and grete benefyces that god vnto vs hath done and doth contynually as well in generall as in partyculer / as well vnto the regarde of the body as of the soule. We see de∣rely that we ben acountable ayenst hym without our power hym to acquyte of as moche as he is a more gretter thynge and a more vaylable than we for whome he it is all gyueth the whiche thynge is infynyte. For he vnto vs hath gyuen his ymage and his semblaunce in our creacyon. God the fa∣der vs gyueth his oonly and his ryght dere sone na¦turall for our redempcyon. The whiche sone vs gyueth his ryght holy flesshe / his swete herte / and his ryght precyous blood for a ryght dygne and spyrytuall refeccyon. The blessyd holy goost also vnto vs gyueth his gyftes and his graces / and by spyrytuall infusyon. All the blessyd trynyte it pro∣mytteth for to gyue vnto vs eternall beatyfycacy∣on. And in recompense of suche thynges all our dede is as no thynge in the whiche it appyreth wel the folysshe presumpcyon of many peple the whi∣che wenen for to preuayle in grete thynges before god. The fyfth reason is that yf we consyder mo∣re ouer and in partyculer the honour / the Joye / the
noblenes and the ryches of paradyse / the whiche is without ende and without measure / as it is to see the blessyd trynyte thre persones in one essence of dyuynyte. To see in lyke wyse with our eyes cor∣porell the ryght holy humanyte of our sauyour Jhesus the whiche shall gyue vnto all his fayth∣full and gloryous chosen pleasaunte lokes / enbra∣synges and swete kyssynges. To see also the swe∣te virgyn Mary moder & quene of all chosen. To see also the gerarchyes heuenly and ordres of angel¦les. To see and vnderstande the vnyon of all the court celestyall. And how by charyte he is taken & the parfyte goodnes and glorye of that one is the welth and the loue of that other / for euery man that loued his neyghbour as hymself hym enioyed of the glorye of his neyghbours as of his owne / By this consyderacyon it appyreth clerely that that ony humayne creature may do for to come vn¦to suche a College and vnto suche honour is lesse than nought. The sixte reason is that we consy∣der profundely the grete dyfferent of a soule the whiche is in the estate of grace / vnto yt the whiche is in deedly synne. We see that that one is the doughter of god by grace and by adopcyon enhe∣rytour of paradyse / and the espouse of Jhesu cry∣ste the temple of the holy goost / sanctuary and the habytacle of all the blessyd trynyte / ryght fayre and ryght pleasaunte enorned and enryched with noble vertues more bryghter and more shynynge spyrytually than euer may do the sonne corporally But all the contrarye is it of the soule in mortall sȳne for she is ye doughter & seruytour by īuocacōn
of our goodly enemye the vessell the stynkynge de¦lytes & vanytees worldely / the temple of ydolatres deuyllesshe / the fals and vnfaythfull rybande the whiche hath broken the fayth & the maryage by∣twene her & the kynge of kynges Jhesus the sone of god the fader for to submytte her vnto the styn∣kynge lechery of ye mesell of deuyll angell apostat By the whiche she is vyle / horryble stynkynge mo¦re than ony carayne as well before god as before all the sayntes of paradyse. By the whiche it appy¦reth that we sholde moche enforce vs to seche ye one estate & to flee the other in as moche as they ben of dyfference. And in so doynge yf god gyue vs not ye grace / there is none the whiche worldely hym may thanke. The seuenth reason for to see and knowe our feblenes and lyfell valure / is in the consydera∣cyon of the lyf and of the vertues of holy faders / apostelles / martyres / confessours / & virgyns. Who where not of yron / or of stele / no more than we be who haue resyste vnto the temptacyons of the de∣uyll / matted and vaynquysshed theyr bodyes by meruayllous penaunce and abstynence / dyspray∣sed the worlde / & suffred martyrdoms terryble all oonly to thynke / haue purchased merytes / the fere and loue of god / holdynge and kepynge the waye of all holynes some in aege of theyr tendre youth / as these blessyd virgyns sayntes and martyrs. Ka∣theryne. Margarete. Annes. Barbare / and other without nombre in dyuers ages / estates / and voca¦cyons. And we the whiche haue theyr lyues by do∣ctryne & example & ye lyght of myracles yt god hath done for to approue ye holynes of theyr lyues. And
that the whiche is more we haue theyr aydes & in∣tercessyons how be it vnto vs they speke not. And notwithstandynge all these thyng{is} we ben laches. frowarde & brought lyghtly to falle & torne to im∣pacyence / in to murmuracyon / in to vnhope / & in to dyspayre. By the whiche appyreth well our ly∣tell fraylte & lytell valour in all these estates ye whi¦che at this daye ben vpon the erthe. That is the ye¦re a thousande & fyue hondred after the Incarna∣cyon & the yeres six thousande six hondred thre sco∣re & six that the worlde began after the conuocacy¦on of the Hebrewes & maner of nombre. The. viij reason is yt yf euery lynner sholde consyder the gre¦uousnes ye grete nombre & vnkyndenes of his syn∣nes & ye rygour of the Justyce dyuyne he sholde kno¦we clerely yt all the penaunce & all the seruyce ye he may do vnto god tyll vnto ye ende of the worlde in byenge ayen ye payne due vnto his synnes / it shol∣de be a thynge of lytell valour in comparyson of ye dette in ye whiche we be boūde for our sȳnes. The ix. reason is yt yf we consyder perfyte ye dyuers ma¦ners & occasyons the whiche in an hondred thou∣sande maners comen & proceden by successyon of tyme as well of ye partye of the worlde as of ye excu¦se of the deuyll & of ye fraylnes of our power & my¦serable condicyon / we sholde defye aboue all of our strength & our metes & vertues in retornynge vs aboue all vnto god by ye true hope yt euery true cry∣sten man ought to haue in god his creatour fon∣tayne & depnes of mercy & of all swetnes. The .x. reason is that yf we consyder the Jugement of god ryght Juste the whiche is done at the houre of deth
and how hym behoueth to yelde acoūpte of all the goodes yt we haue receyued ben they goodes of na∣ture / of fortune / or of grace / tyll vnto the laste far∣dynge & of all the tyme of our lyf tyll vnto the clo¦synge of the eye. In lyke wyse also the purenes of conscyence / the ornament of merytes & of vertues that we shall haue before god & the satysfaccyon of synnes yt other tymes we haue cōmytte / we shall see clerely yt our goodnes is a lytell thynge as vnto yt yt we myght haue done in comparyson of thyng{is} be∣forsayd / & ryght grete is our iperfeccyon. The .xi. reason for to holde vs in fere & in mekenes is that yf we consydre the shortnes of this lyf / the necessy¦te to deye / the incertayne of ye houre of a moment & of the estate we see clerely yt to lytell is the prepa¦racyon / the fere / & the dysposycyon the whiche shol de be in vs for to receyue suche auenture. The .xij. reason is that yf we consydre the sayenge of saynt Gregory / that is to vnderstande yt those the which wyll come vnto saluacōn sholde alwayes go from good vnto better / & moūte from vertue vnto vertue or elles they go behynde by slouth & neclygence / we see clerely that ryght lytell is the profyte / & ryght grete & peryllous our slouth & neclygence. The .xiij reason is that yf we consydre perfytly the grete & horryble paynes of helle / as vnto the oppresseth as vnto the dyuersyte vnto the multytude as well a∣yenst the body as ayenst the soule and the eternyte of them the whiche euery synner deserued in com∣myttynge mortall synne / we knowe that all the pe¦naunce that we haue done in tyme paste / and that we may doo tyll vnto the ende of the worlde / it is
a ryght lytell thynge / and also as no thynge yf we¦re not the meryte of the blessyd passyon in compa∣ryson of our synnes. Also we sholde enforce vs of body & of soule to holde suche lyf by the whiche we may escape ye paynes beforsayd ye whiche ben more greter than man may tell or thynke so as wytnes∣seth saynt Austyn. These .xiij. reasons ben noted & drawen out of ye boke of ye lyf of Jhesu cryst in gre∣te shortnes. For ye spyryte deuoute & contemplatyf vnto this proprete as we fewe wordes dyuyned / he can rede & vnderstande grete & meruayllous senten¦ces. And this is done by the ayde & vertue of ye holy goost / the whiche enumyned & lyfteth ye soule vp∣warde from the puyssaūces naturelles & hym ma∣keth to taste and to sauour the worde of god what so euer it be. For it is the meete spyrytuell the whi¦che gyueth nourysshynge / force / augmentacyon / and puyssaūce / vnto euery persone the whiche hath in hym the helte of grace. Also it is to be noted that the resolucyon / ende / and conclusyon of eue∣ry one of these .xiij. reasons aboue sayd is in two poyntes. The fyrst is to the ende that the persone the whiche this present aduysement well reded & de¦noutly studyed may in trewe humylyte haue clere knowlege of the lytelnes and imperfeccyon of all his werkes what so euer they be / by the whiche kno¦wlege he hym shall defende from all vayne glory and shall see cloely the grete foly and derkenes of ypocresye / vayne glorye / and folysshe though∣tes. The seconde poynt is yt the persone the whiche wyll here founde his medytacyon may & ought to take feruour & desyre to profyte in graces. in viues
in clymmynge from steyre to steyre without euer hym to contempte tyll vnto that that she may co∣me vnto the vysyon of god in the royalme of para¦dyse. The whiche by his blessyd grace vnto vs wyl gyue the fader / and the sone / and the holy goost / one god in trynyte of persones. ¶Here foloweth the thyrde partye of this booke in the whiche is made mencyon of the seuen wer∣kes of mercy and it conteyneth fyue chapytres. ¶The Prologue. AFter the treatyse of haptem / of the artycles of the fayth / & of the cōmaundementes of the lawe / with the seuen deedly synnes / here folo∣weth the .vij. werkes of mercy / & suche is the reason
of this ordre. For after saynt Gregory as moche asQuātū credis tm̄ s{per}as {quam}tū credis & spastm̄ diligis{quam}t̄ credis s{per}astm̄ dili∣gistm̄ oparis. gre. the persone hath of fayth & of hope / as moche and no more hath of charyte / and as moche as he hath of charyte / he hath of the werkes of mercy. That is to knowe / yf he haue lytell of charyte he hath lytell of good werkes. By the werkes than shal be knowen the fayth / the hope / and the charyte. For as it is sayd before / the fayth is deed the whiche bereth not the werkes of mercy. By the whiche it is for to knowe that mercy is a noble vertue by the whiche a man hath compassyon and pyte of his neyghbour and of his mysery and necessyte. For whan it is so that by the commaundement of god euery creature ought for to loue his neyghbour as hymself / it foloweth that the ylle of an other ought for to be the pyte and compassyon of a true crysten man obedyent vnto the cōmaundementes of god of nature. And for as moche as man is of two na¦tures / that is to knowe corporall and spyrytuall / in euery of these two partyes / he there may haue pouerte / sykenes / or other necessyte. There are two maners of mercyes / that is for to knowe corporell and spyrytuell. ¶Here foloweth the seuen werkes of mercy in ge∣nerall.Caplm mū THe werkes of mercy corporall ben compry∣sedA fructt{us} co{rum} co∣gnosceteos.

to do & accomplysshe the werkes of mercy corporel ayenst his neyghbour / a thynge of grete profyte / a thynge due / & a thynge necessary vnto saluacyon. Fyrst it is a thynge of grete profyte / for as wytnes¦seth the holy scrypture / in lyke wyse as the water quenched the fyre / in lyky wyse almesdede & mercy putteth awaye the synnes / nor it may not be done that the soule the whiche truely hath done mercy in this worlde gooth vnto payne & torment in the other. For god of mercy infynyte loued as well eue¦ry poore rrature humayne / the whiche hath pacy∣ence in his pouerte / mysery / or necessyte / where that the whiche vnto hym is done of goodes and of pleasure for the loue of hym and of charyte it is reputed for to be done vnto hymselfe. And god god the whiche defended the synne of vnkyndenes the whiche is not to knowe the goodnes and plea∣sure yt man hath receyued of an other / wyll graūt the good the whiche hath ben done for the loue of hym after as it apperteyned vnto his dyuyne ma∣ieste. And for that he promyseth mercy and the re∣alme of paradyse vnto all them the whiche accom¦plysshe the werkes of mercy / and dampnacyon e∣ternall the whiche in place and in tyme due them do not accomplysshe. By the whiche it appyreth that to excercyse hym in the werkes of mercy is a thynge of grete and inestymable prouffyte / and for to do the contrary it is the perdycyon of all good∣nes. Also it is a thynge oblygatorye / for all that that man may haue in this worlde / be it the bo∣dy / the soule / or the goodes worldely / he holdeth all of god / ben they temporell or spyrytuell. Who cō∣maundeth
vpon the payne of deth that a man do mercy vnto his neyghbour / for elles a man shall not fynde the mercy of god / without the whiche noEstote misericor∣des sicut p vester misericors ē. lu. vi creature may haue saluacyon. And here appyreth the excellent mercy and bounte infynyte of god a∣yenst nature humayne / vnto whome he gyueth the goodes worldely and temporall / by the whiche she may purchase the goodes of glorye the whiche ben eternall. But here may be demaunded of hym theA questyon. whiche hath desyre hym for to saue by what com∣maundement and by what lawe he is bounde for to do mercy / and in what maner he ought for to seche it. By the whiche it is for to vnderstande that for to do mercy it is commaunded in the lawe of nature / in the lawe dyuyne / and in the lawe Ca∣non. The lawe of nature commaunded for to lo∣ue his neyghbour / for naturally euery thynge lo∣ueth his semblable. Now it is so that yf true loueOē aial diligit si∣bi sile. Probatio dilectōis exhibitio est o{per}is. Eregori{us} Amice ad d ven¦sti. Mathei .xxvi. be in the herte / she is sheweth by werkes outwar∣de yf it be possyble / for elles there is no loue. Also the lawe dyuyne cōmaunded for to loue his neygh¦bour as hymselfe / and in that doynge promytteth god the lyf of glorye / and vnto them that do it not the deth eternall. The seuen werkes of mercy benNō mmini mala morte mortuū  l benter o{per}a pietas exercuit. hʐ ei mul¦tos ītercessores et īpossibile ē orōes multo{rum} n̄ exaudiri Amb. in li. de offi. vnderstande to be cōmaunded in the fourth com∣maundement the whiche is for to honour fader & moder. Also the lawe Canon cōmaunded to do so∣cour vnto thy neyghbour in necessyte / who so euer loued god loued that that loueth hym / and therfo∣re sayth a man comenly / he that loued me loued my hounde. Now is it so that god loued euery er∣thely persone / as it appyreth by the gospell the sa∣me
of his traytour Judas. Or elles he vnto hym he sholde not gyue lyfe beynge nor no substaunce and he sholde not tarye for to penaunce. By the whiche it behoueth for to conclude / that who so lo¦ueth not his neyghbour / loueth not god in lyke wyse as he commaundeth hym. But reste for to see whan and in what maner a man ought to ac∣complysshe the commaundement to do mercy vp∣on payne of deedly synne. By the whiche it is to be noted that whan ony persone hath of the goo∣des of this worlde after the necessyte of his estate and of his condycyon / and more ouer hath habon¦daunce of goodes of the whiche he it may well spa¦re and his neyghbour it requyre in his grete neces∣syteFi eliosinā pau∣{per}is ne defraudes.

In the whiche it appyreth clerely that the synne and the peryll of dampna∣cyon of them the whiche haue habondaūce of worl¦dely goodes / and they see from daye to daye grete multytude of poore people in trybulacyon & neces∣syte without yeldynge and payenge them that that they vnto them sholde by the ryght of nature and the commaundement of god / that is for to do vn∣toQuā difficile di∣ues itrabit regnū elo{rum}.

By the whi∣che Thobye replete with the holy goost / requyred
of god that he wolde not gyue hym in this worlde grete habondaūce of rychesses / but all oonly vnto the necessyte of this lyf. The whiche thynge is mo¦cheetit amor ∣mi {que}tū ipsa pecu∣ia crescit.

Reste than to see of e∣uery werke of mercy in partyculer. ¶Here foloweth of euery werke of mercy in par∣tyculer. THe fyrste werke of mercy / that is to gyueCaplm .ij. meete vnto hym the whiche is in necessyte / for without mete no man may lyue nor longe endu¦re. The seconde is to gyue drynke. for without dryn¦ke no man may dygeste nor conserue the helth of the body humayne / and it ought for to be vnder∣stande of them the whiche ben in pouerte / in sy∣kenes / in age / or other necessyte / wherfor they may not gette theyr lyuynge / and they haue none other the whiche vnto them mynystreth. Or of those the whiche haue auouwed pouerte euangelyke / and not of other the whiche may well gete theyr ly∣uynge / but by theyr slouth and trewandyse they wolde lyue of almesse without labour. The thyr∣de is for to cloth and to couer the poore humayne bodyes of his neyghbours. The fourth is for to gadre in to his hous these poore pylgrymes / and them the whiche haue not where for to harborowe them. The fyfth is by pyte and compassyon for
to vysyte the syke people in doynge vnto them ay∣de & consolacyon. The sixt is to ayde the poore pry¦soners to delyuer them & put them at lyberte. The seuenth is to burye them that ben deed / in dede or in wyll yf other is accomplysshe not. For the good wyll suffyseth before god / whan a man may not do it in werke outwarde / or that other the whiche hath more greter dysposycyon it putteth in execu∣cyon. ¶ Here foloweth the circūstaūces for to accomplys¦she the werkes of mercy merytoryously. IN that yt these werkes of mercy beforsaydCapm. iij. ben vnto god pleasaūt & merytoryous vnto saluacyon / they ought to be done Joyfully / chary∣tably / lyberally / and faythfully.

I haue hadde hongre and thorste and ye haue gyuen me meete and drynke / I haue ben a pylgryme and ye haue herborowed me. I had nede of clothes and ye haue clothed me.

And sythen that it is so that ye wolde not lodge me in your houses in the persone of my poore people. I ought not you nor wyll not lodge you in the royalme of pa∣radyse. And therfore go you with all the deuylles in to the fyre of helle eternall. And here is the sen∣tence and consummacyon of all the worlde and of the grete Jugement that all folke abydes. By the whiche sentence it apyreth that moche more noble more sure and more dygne is the estate of holy po∣uerte / or of lyfe contemplatyfe / than of rychesses worldely / the whiche is the lyfe actyfe. Also euery creature ought well to take hede in his herte yf he be poore ryche or meane. The poore by what tytle in what necessyte / and by what intencyon / he re∣quyreth and taketh almesse / for yf in beggynge he maketh hym poore or impotent for to wynne his lyuynge he synned ryght greuously as a theef and is boūde to make restytucyon. In the whiche it appyreth the theeft and dampnacyon of many
the which renne thrugh crystendom / y• which after men theyr lesynges and falsenes / that many ab∣bayes / chirches / hospytalles / colleges and monaste ryes that they namen may not be susteyned reedy∣fyed nor the poore people to be comforted without the almesdede of people / of whome they demaun∣den oftentymes for to enryche themself. The mea∣ne is he the whiche is neyther ryche nor poore / but all oonly hath his necessyte that he receyueth for suffysaunce. And he is in as grete surete as the ry∣che is in grete daunger. For to gyue vnduely it is a thynge of punycyon / and not to gyue what cha∣ryte it cōmaunded / and necessyte it requyred / it is ayenst god / and he synned / and this is as now vn∣to the werkes of mercy corporall. ¶Here foloweth the werkes of mercy spyrytuall. HEre foloweth of the werkes of mercy spy∣rytuellCaplm .iiij. of the whiche it is for to vnderstande that durynge this lyf there ben two estates / or two maner of lyues. That is the estate of the lyf actyf as ben people maryed or not maryed / ben they no∣blesse / burgeyses / marchaundes / labourers / or of ony oter crafte / of the whome the vocacyon and occupacyon ben in these thynges worldely and er∣thely. The other estate is of them of the lyfe con∣templatyfe / as ben the people of the chirche / and pryncypally relygyous men who sholde take hede vnto the seruyce of god / and vnto thynges spyry∣tuall
/ as well for them as for those of the lyf acty▪ By the meane of whome they be susteyned in theyr necessytees corporelles / that notwithstandynge it is ryght conuenyent that the one estate take par∣te with the other / for none ought for to be all oon∣ly actyue / but that he haue some thynge of the ly∣ue contemplatyue. And in lyke wyse the contem∣platyue hym ought for to excercyse in some occu∣pacyon corporell in place and in tyme after good dyscrecyon / and for as moche as the lyfe actyue is good / and also that the lyfe contemplatyue is mo∣che more better / he that myght perfaytly haue the∣se tweyne he sholde be ryght parfyte for the estate of this presente lyfe. But for to haue parfaytly these two thynges it is the synguler preuylege of the holy blessyd virgyn Mary and of Jhesu cryste her oonly sone in as moche as he is man. For two lyues vnto vs were full well sygnyfyed and fygu∣red in Martha and in Mary Mawdelayne / as it is sayd before / with the whiche women systers / and dwellers in one selfe house the blessyd JhesuIntrauit {us} qd dā castellsi.

And vnto this purpose weExemplum. rede suche an example. There was but late an holy heremyte excellent in contemplacōn / & in the exer∣cyte or vsynge of lyf spyrytuall / the whiche yt not wt standynge he coūseylled wt an other holy abbot tou¦chynge the dede of conscyence vnto hym declaryn∣ge yt he hath yet such pouerte & defaute of perfeccōn that whan he seeth the synnes & imperfeceyons of some of his crysten broder / he e hym myght well and Joyously receyue in his company. But ryght gladly he receyueth those in whome he knoweth grete goodnes & them he socoureth Joyously in theyr necessytees. And than the holy abbot seynge the imperfeccyon of hym the whiche sholde haue dyscrecyon of necessytees humayne & more to peyse the spyrytuelles than the corporelles / he began to wepe in sayenge. Alas wel we sholde ameruayle y• innocence of humayne bodyes / for ayenst the grete mercy of our neyghbours we ben dulled & auenged more cruelly than bestes. For hogges & other bestes & byrdes sayenge theyr semblable cryenge & in so∣me necessyte / them enforce to socour thē & to shewe them the sygne of compassyon. And therfore I an∣swere the vnto yt yt yu hast purposed vnto me y• in re¦ceyuynge Joyously the good {per}sone yu doost a lytell good / but yf yu receyue pyteously & in cōpassyon the poore synner in shewynge hȳ his saluacyon yu dost a more gretter almesdede in as moche as he is in
more greter necessyte than the good persone. He sholde be ryght dulle & full of grete cruelte ye whi∣che seeth his very broder almoost rotten of meselle∣ry deye & in anguysshe of hongre & of thorste / boū∣de & imprysoned in the pryson of his mortall ene∣myes yf he hym may ayde & conforte / & he hym le¦ued before he deyed without hauynge of hym pyte & compassyon. Now is it than so that mortall syn¦ne in the soule of our crysten broder is moche hor∣ryble mesellery & more greter pouerte & wretchyd∣nes than is the necessyte corporell before sayd. By the whiche it appyreth in what pyte & compassyon sholde be the whiche see from daye to daye so ma∣ny of synnes & so horryble as well in our self as in our broder crysten men. And therfore ought well to take hede euery creature in ryght of hymself the meane to acquyte hym in accomplysshynge ye wer∣kes of mercy spyrytuell / the whiche ben pryncypa∣ly seuen vnderstanden by the latyn that foloweth.

Ma∣the. vi. it appyreth by the gospell by the whiche our lorde sayth & promytted that yf we pardonne par∣fectly for the loue of hym vnto our neyghbours the offence that they haue cōmytted ayenst vs / he vnto vs pardonned the grete offences & infynyte that we haue done ayenst hym / as oftentymes & as ma¦ny as we trespassen his cōmaundement and it is that that we hym requere from daye to daye whan we saye our Pater noster.

In lyke wyse as for the loue of you we pardonne our neyghbours the lytell offences that they haue cōmytted ayenst vs / The peryll not to accomplysshe this werke and commaundement appyreth clerely by that / that Jhesu cryste sayth in the gospell that yf we par∣donne not with herte vnto those the whiche hath vs offended / god the fader shall neuer pardonne vs the grete offences that we vnto hym haue done.

For yt is not ayenst charyte / but there to is boūden he the whiche hath offended. The se∣conde maner of mercy is to correcte charytably the synnes and defautes that a man hath perceyued in his neyghbour. And for as moche as these synnes ben grete meruayllous and open in many people / who so euer desyred to do the commaundement of god and the saluacyon of his soule may make su∣che a questyon. That is to knowe whan & in whatA questyon. maner a man is bounde to correcte his neyghbour vpon ye payne of deedly synne / the answere. VntoThe answe that ther ben two maner of correccyons. The one is of necessyte of Justyce / the other of necessyte of charyte. Correccyon of Justyce apertayned alonely vnto them ye whiche hath ony prelacōn vpon a no∣ther / as is ye good man of the house in his house / the whiche may haue his wyfe / his childern / & his seruaūtes / vnto whome he sholde do correccyon af∣ter as it aperteyned vnto his Jurisdiccyon not all oonly by charyte / but wt yt by Justyce to the ende to
acquyte hym & to gyue example. Also these curat{is} these abbottes / bysshoppes / & other prelates ayenst theyr subgectes after as it apertayned vnto theyr Jurisdiccyon.

The seconde correccion ye whiche is of the necessyte of true charyte apertayned not all oonly vnto the prelates of holy chirche / or vnto these lor¦des erthely / but with y• vnto all them vnto whome god cōmaūded to loue theyr neyghbours as them self. And for as moche as euery man is boūde hym to repente & correcte of his owne propre synne / it foloweth yt he ye whiche is boūde to loue his neygh¦bour as hymself that he ought to do his power hȳ to correcte & amende / or elles there is not in hym true charyte / in lyke wyse as god commaunded vpon payne of deedly synne. But it is well to be noted that after as sayen these doctours of theo∣logye six condycyons ben requysyte before that a man synned mortally in not correctynge his ney∣ghbour / of the whiche thre ben in the regarde of hym the whiche ought for to correcte / and these other thre ben in regarde of hym the whiche ough¦te for be corrected. The fyrste is whan that he the whiche ought to corecte is certayne of ye synne of his neyghbour. for of sȳnes secrete a man is not
bounde so straytly. The seconde is that the correc∣cyon be swete or pyteous syns yt it ought to procede of charyte. The thyrde is yt there is none other vn∣to whome it appertayned more couenably for to correcte. For yf an other do it / it shall acquyte suf∣fycyently them the whiche elles had ben holden to correcte. The fyrst condycyon of the partye of the synner is that he haue in hym suche dysposycyon that a man may hope that for the correccyon he is the lesse worth / as it may be a persone dronken / a lecherous man / a man of grete turour or of obsty∣nate yt a man may not truste correccōn / than a mā ought to dyfferre & abyde the place tyme & oportu¦nyte to do it. For in suche caas suffysed pyte chary¦table & good wyll. The seconde condycyon is whe¦re the synne of hym that a man ought to corecte is mortall / or that is may be very semblable. For as for venyall synne a man is not bounde to correcte vpon the payne of deedly synne. But is boūde all oonly for to counseyll / and after good congruyte / and this gyueth well to vnderstande the gospell the whiche sayth. Correcte thy neyghbour / and yf by thy correccyon he be conuerted thou hast wonne hym. By the whiche it foloweth after as sayth saynt Gregory / that the synne wherof he hath ben corrected was mortall. For for a lytell synne a man is not loste and dampned. Also yf a man we∣re bounde for to correcte euery defaute / or feblenes venyell the whiche contynually is in many / full fewe it sholde sauour / and yf it were not that the transgressyon of that commaundement were in e∣uery dede of theyr conscyence. The thyrde condy∣cyon
that he there haue place tyme & oportunyte. Be it than so spoken and concluded. That who so euer knoweth ye mortall synne of his neyghbour & the peryll of his dampnacōn & hath place tyme & oportunyte for to correcte / & there is none other ye whiche dooth by oblygacyon or other wyse / & it is very lyke yt yf he were correcte & so he hȳ sholde a∣mende. Than and not elles a man is holden vp∣on the payne of deedly synne hym to aduyse swetly and charytably / for elles a man trespasseth the cō¦maundement of god & of nature / the whiche is to loue god his creatoure with all his herte abone all thynges / and in lyke wyse his neyghbour as hym∣selfe. Whan it is so than / that the moost grettestQui nō diligit fra¦trē suū quē videt. deū quē nō videt quō pōt diligere. 1. to. iiii. ca. Amor dei nun{quam} ē ociousus. o{per}at em̄ magna si est. si ve∣ro renuerit o{per}ari amor nō ē. hec gre mysery that may be in man is the estate of deedly synne / how may it than be that ony man loueth his neyghbour as hymself yf he socoure not hym vnto his power in suche necessyte. Also saynt John sayth in his Canon that he the whiche loueth not his neyghbour may not loue god faythfully / loue may not be hydde. For yf ony man haue true loue he shall shewe it in werkes by accomplysshynge the werkes of mercy in doynge thynges grete or lytell after the quantyte of his loue / in lyke wyse as wytnesseth saynt Gregory. And therfore he the whiche hath trewely the loue of god in his herte dyspayreth not lyghtely the correccyon of his neyghbour / and hym enforceth for to correcte hym in the vertue of the holy goost / the whiche may all thynges. The thyrde maner of mercy spyrytuell is to teche them the whiche ben ignoraunt / by the whiche techynge the soule is fedde with the brede
of holy doctryne. In lyke wyse as the body is nou¦rysshed and susteyned with meete corporell. And yf it be so than that for to gyue meete and drynke vnto the poore for the necessyte of the body god promytteth the royalme of paradyse. For by the more gretter reason he shall gyue his glorye vnto them the whiche for the loue of hym gyuen vnto the soules good and holy techynge. For of as mo∣cheMaior ē refecti mē {quam} vētris. u as the soule is more dygne than the body / of as moche the meete and the refeccyon spyrytuell is more noble than that of the body. Sythen it is so than that the moost partye of our neyghbours ben in languore of ignoraūce / & that the horryble famyne inuadeth all moost all the worlde for the defaute of brede spyrytuell / that is for to vnderstan¦de of holy doctryne / as it may be to saue hym the whiche hath scyence and knowlege of thynges the whiche apperteynen vnto the saluacyon of ye soule & seeth his neyghbour deye in languysshynge forEterne dnatis penā icurrit p̄ dica¦tor  semen diuini vbi nō sgit. xliiii. di. the defaute of this doctryne / certayne with grete payne may he be excused before god of the cōmaū¦dement to accomplysse mercy.

Mathei. v. of theyr offyce / as these prelates of holy chir¦che / and these prechours the whiche for suche vo∣cacyons they ben called the lyght of the worlde / and the salt of the erthe. For they gyuen lyght and techen the people symple and ignoraunt / and vnto theym gyuen good sauour and deuocyon in preseruynge them to theyr power from the stenche and corrupcyon of all synne by good example of lyf / by good doctryne and good exortacyon / and in
so doynge the holy fader of mercy vnto them pro∣mysed to make thē grete in ye reame of paradyse. Also curates / faders / and moders / godfaders / and godmoders / auncyent people / maysters of scole / and other ought them to acquyte ayenst theym of whome they haue charge / in techynge them / and repreuynge theym of theyr defautes after as it is sayd before in the mater of correccyon as well fra∣ternall as of Jurysdyccyon. The fourth maner of mercy spyrytuall is to recomforte them discomfor∣ted / & this werke is moche necessary. For by heuy∣nes & desolacyon oftymes a man falleth in to dys∣payre / & from dyspayre vnto eternall dampnacōn And therfore who so euer charytably conforted the dyscomforted he draweth hym backe from helle as moche as in hym is. The whiche thynge is as mo∣che pleasaūt vnto god / as moche as is ye grete loue of the whiche he loued his creature / for whome to saue & preserue from dampnacyon he hath wylled to deye. By ye whiche it foloweth yt to comforte the∣se dyscomforted is a werke of ryght excellent mery¦te before god. To coūseyll & to comforte is ye offy∣ce ryght synguler / as well of the blessyd Jhesu cryst as of the blessyd holy goost. By the whiche it apy∣reth that he the whiche accomplysshed not the wer¦ke of recomforte ye dyscomforted whan there is pla¦ce & tyme cōmytted as moche grete ylle as it is to do grete good merytoryous & pleasaūt vnto god. The fyfth maner of almesdede spyrytuall is to cō¦forteEgo rogabo prēm & aliū {per}aclitū da∣bit vobis. Io. xiiii Paraclit{us} aūt dē est qd consolator. & to enhardy those to do well the whiche ben weke in spyryte / many there ben the whiche done grete thynges vertuous and merytoryous / but by
the vyce & synne of pusyllanymyte or cowardyse / they are not vndertake to come vnto so grete good∣nes. Wherfor them to enhardy & them to gyue cou¦rage to do & vndertake these thynges the whiche ben vnto the glorye of god & of the saluacyon of theyr soules is the werke of moche grete charyte & moche pleasaunt and merytoryous before god & by the consequent the defaute of that to do and ac¦complysshe is moche peryllous and dyspleasaunt vnto god / & specyally in them vnto whome it ap∣pertayned by theyr offyce the estate & vocacyons to make stronge & exorte the comen people to do well as ben the people of the chirche / ben they prelates / curates / relygyous / or other. And whan it shal hap¦pen that they sholde as to make stronge susteyne & to ayde these other for to vndertake werkes me∣rytoryous in wekynge them & dyscouragynge / be it by theyr euyll example or otherwyse well nere al shall be lost & wasted.

For sythen it is so yt all the blood of Jhesu cryste had ben gyuen & shedde for the precyousnes of the soule the whiche is the ymage of the blessyd trynyte the temple & habytacyon of the holy goost the loue and the delytes of Jhesu cryste / and the whiche may come vnto the beatytude eternall of
paradyse / as may the true catholyke the seruaunt of Jhesu cryste seen & knowen without grete com∣passyon and without effusyon of teeres so noble a creature consecrated of god by the holy creame and the espouse of Jhesu cryste put and abandonned vnto the foule lykenes of deuylles / fylthy / vyle / and dysfygured by synne / some more than deuyl∣les / by the whiche the blood and passyon of Jhesu cryste ben moche more dyspraysed than the thynge foyled and troden vnder the feet of all maner of beestes. Alas more than a thousande tyme alas a∣las how thynke we to be faythfull vnto Jhesu cry¦ste & to see suche pyte & suche deluge of soules spe∣cyally crysten men wtout anguysshe & compassyon the whiche is no thynge yf it be not shewed in the werkes of mercy. The .vij. maner of almesdede spyrytuall is / to hydde / to couer / and to anguysshe the ylle and dyffame of his neyghbour / not to pu∣blysshe and shewe it by enuye or ony other cursyd entencyon. For sythen it is so that good renowne is a grete goodnes noble and spyrytuall / as how may it be done that ony man loueth god and his neyghbour yf he vnto hym yelde not and conser∣ue his good renowne in couerynge his synnes / his defautes and his fragylytees. Certes it is impos∣syble / and in as moche as the synne of our neygh∣bour is moche grete / of as meche haue we the mo∣re gretter mater for to accomplysshe ayenst hym the more gretter mercy / and for to haue ayenst god humylyte / fere / and loue / in byleuynge certaynely that neuer creature dyde synne so grete or detesta∣ble / but that we may do more gretter or semblable
yf god kepe vs not and the seruyce of these blessyd angeles. And in lyke wyse as of suche synne I shol de haue wyll it for to hydde. In lyke wyse euery man it ought to do ayen his neyghbour by very cō¦passyon and charyte. The .viij. maner of almesde de spyrytuall is to exhorte and meoue the good to prouffyte from good vnto better / in shewynge them that they them kepe to presume folysshly of theyr good werkes / of the whiche the honour and the glorye apperteyned all oonly vnto god. Also that they haue in fere and in hate the fauour and the prayse of the worldely people / the whiche often tymes taken and magnyfyen that the whiche god reproueth and punyssheth. Of suche fauours ma∣kethA sagita volāte in die a negotio {per}am bulante &c. p̄s. xc. oftentymes the deuyll his darte or his arowe the whiche he casteth in the mydde daye / that is the vayne glorye the whiche taken these grete foy∣les and full lytell well auysed of good werkes. Al∣so ben they aduysed that for ony lyf or penaūce of tyme passed they be not of all assured for to be per¦faytely acquyted before god. And therfore wat∣chen they vpon theyr warde in full grete fere and in humylyte / in bryngynge oftentymes to mynde the estate and the feruour from whens saynt Pe∣ter felle the whiche so pyteously forsoke his creato¦re. Also Dauyd. Salomon.

And comenly the rote and the foundacyon of theyr temptacyons hath ben to presume of themself / & to dysprayse poore synners
for one of the grettest temptacyons vnto people of deuocyon is to compare theyr lyf of penaūce / gre∣te / noble / and excellent vnto the pouerte & vnto the mysery & feblenes of theyr neyghbours the whiche ben in grete & horryble synnes. And by this meane felle and hym enpryded the pharysee of whome maked mencyon the holy texte of the gospell. But those the whiche ben taught & inspyred prouffy∣ten gretly vnto the occasyon of the synnes of theyr neyghbours. For of that they humble them vnto god / en knowlechynge that it is more greter gyfte of god to preserue ony from the fallynge vnto syn¦ne / than hym for to areyse after that he is fallen. And yf it be so that the lyf and the merytes of ma¦ny relygyous and other the whiche yet ben at this daye is a lytell thynge in comparyson of the lyfe and holynes of them beforsayd. Who oftentymes haue so gretely fayled / what is he the whiche ough¦te to truste in hymself or his merytes. The .ix. ma¦ner of almesdede spyrytuall is to gyue good coun∣seyll in thynges spyrytuell / & this werke is moche pleasaūt vnto god / and of grete meryte vnto them that it may do in confermynge hym vnto the bles¦sydVocab nomē ei{us} admirabilis {con}silia rius de{us} fortis &c. ysaie. ix. ca. Jhesu cryste / the whiche for his example and doctryne is named the tongue of greate counseyll. The gretenes of this werke and the meryte may be consydered in the hyghenes and dyffyculte of the cause of the Juge and of the partye aduersary. The cause is for to lese / or for to wynne parady∣se. The Juge is god almyghty / and all knowyn∣ge / by the whiche fals excusacyon / cautelles / cauyl¦lacyons / appellacyons / dylacyons / fere / fauours /
gyftes / or promysses / haue no place in this courte for to peruerte Justyce. The aduersarye is the de∣uyll of whome the malycyous cautell & to excuse his practyse and longe experyence surmounten all naturall intendement of humayne creature. And therfore whan a man seeth that the deuyll dyscey∣ued enmused and entysed the poore creature hu∣mayne for to dampne hym and for to make hym to lese paradyse / it is a moche excellent werke of charyte to counseyll hym the meane for to with∣stande the malyce of the deuyll / and hym for to ayde for to come to wynne and to possede so noble an herytage as is the royalme of paradyse. But euery intendement ought well for to haue in hym meruayllous pyte and compassyon of the moost grettest partye of them lyuynge the whiche an hon¦dred thousande tymes ben more dylygent to suche counseyll / to purchase or for to defende theyr ryght in twoo or thre feet of londe / of dwellynges / than they do for to purchase the royalme of paradyse / the whiche vnto theym apperteyned by true ryght of herytage. The whiche vnto vs hath playnely and ryght lawfully purchased our fader Jhesu cry¦ste. And of that folye hath other tymes founde the experyence the whiche foloweth. The yeres a thou¦sande foure hondred foure score and thre / a noble man of the royalme of Fraunce vnto his goostly fader reknowleged and confessed vpon the loyalte of his fayth that he pleated by thre yeres in the grande or grete assyse in the Cyte of Bourgeys for the ryght that belened to haue thre halfe pens of rente by the yere / and he was not yet at the fyne
nor ende of his cause / but he abode in doubte for to lese or to wynne / & he affermed that with his costes and his dyspenses as well of his moeuable as of his herytage / he hath taken the beste coun∣seyll that vnto hym was possyble for to fynde / and after the relacyon / and the whiche me semed very semblable / he myght haue made more than an hondred myles vpon londe. And a semblable thyn¦ge make many of other worldely people the whi∣che make not one myle nor yet halfe a myle for to seche one good coūseyll of conscyence. By the whi∣che it behoued for to conclude that cause of many done ylle is for that they renne from the grete and infynyte Justyce of Jhesu cryste. The .x. maner of almesdede is for to pacyfye and accorde them the whiche ben in dyscorde. And how be it it is grete this werke and merytoryous before god / it appy∣reth that it is for to vndo that that the deuyll hath done / and for to do that that Jhesu cryste is comen for to do in this worlde / and hath shewed by his example and commaundement for to do. The labour and operacyon of the deuyll is for to put noyses / debates / warres / and dyuysyons in all esta¦tes / for the whiche cometh pletynges / hates / deba∣tes / and oftentymes murdres / grete losse of goodes and of bodyes and of soules / for who that hated his neyghbour lesed god the whiche may not aby∣de but in the conscyence of hym the whiche hath peas with his neyghbour. And therfore whan our lorde was borne for to fyght and for to destroye the puyssaunce of the deuyll he dyde do crye with the sounde of trompettes of paradyse peas in erthe
And therfore of good ryght he is named kynge ofGloria in exil deo. & in terra pax hoib{us} bone volta¦tis. Luce .ii. Jherusalem and prynce of peas. By the whiche it appyreth that for to put peas and vnyte bytwene them the whiche ben at dyscorde debate or dyuy∣syon it is for to do as moche grete seruyce vnto the kynge of peas in hym prepayrynge the chambre and the habytacyon where he wyll enhabyte and reste / the whiche seruyce and offyce may not be do∣ne without grete retrybucyon. And by the contra∣rye for to put dyuysyon warre and debate bytwe∣ne ony persones is proprely the offyce of the de∣uyll and of his membres. And therfore sayth holySex sūt  odit d{us} & septimū detesta∣tur aia ei{us} {pro}uer. vi scrypture that there ben .vi. thynges that god ha∣teth moche / but the seuenth he hateth soueraynly. The fyrste of the sixe is pryde. For our lorde is of humylyte infynyte. The seconde is lyenge / for he is trought dyuyne. The thyrde is crudelyte / for he is swete / benygne / and mercyfull. The fourth is enuye / cautelle / or trechery / for he is bonte with∣out faynynge. The fyfth is vnfaythfulnes ayenst Justyce / for he is the Juge of Justyce infynyte. The sixte is fals wytnes the whiche is contrarye / as well vnto the trought as vnto charyte / but abo∣ue all these thynges before sayd he hath in hor∣rour or in hate hym the whiche soweth hatred de∣bate dyscorde and dyuysyon bytwene them the whi¦che ben and ought for be frendes / and therfore they the whiche ben peasyble of good ryght benBeati pacifici q fl dei vocab. math .v. trr sensa. Maledi guerr h su diaboli vocab. called in the gospell the childern of god. And by the contrarye may a man saye that they the whi∣che sowen hates / warres / dyscordes / dyuysyons / and debates that ben the childern of the deuyll of
helle. The .xi. maner of almesdede spyrytuall isNullū credi{us} ad salutē nisi deo i∣tāte veute. nullū iutat salutē suā isi deo adiuuāte o{per}ar. nullū nisi o∣antē auriliū {pro}me ter. her aug .li. de eccl. dogmati.

And this almesse prouffyteth vnto the body and vnto the soule in all maner necessyte. For by this almesse or ayde vnto his neyghbours hath purchased sapy∣ence / vertues / and merytes / and fynably the royal me of paradyse / the whiche noo man may haue and gete of hymselfe. By the whiche it behoueth that by humylyte and by prayer a man them re∣quyre of god / the whiche so for to do vs hath war∣ned. Where of sayth well the holy doctour saynt Austyn that noo maner man may come vnto sal∣uacyon yf that god calle hym not / nor noo maner of man may come yf that god ayde hym not / nor also he wyll not ayde hym yf that a man requyre it not. The whiche thynge is done by deuoute prayers / that is for to lyfte vp his herte vnto god by true fayth without ony maner of thynge or ar∣tycle for to doubte / that he is more puyssaunt for to gyue moche more gretter thynges than ony ma∣ner of man can thynke or demaunde. Also a man ought for to byleue stedfastly that wyll make his prayers auaylable the whiche is the fontayne and depnesse of mercy / of pyte / and of swetnesse infy∣fynyte / and he the whiche may not fayle nother lye. And alwayes sayth he in the gospell / that yf two or thre persones ben vnyed in good charyte / he them shall gyue that that they of hym requyre prouffytable for the glorye of god and for theyr saluacyon. If it than a thynge dygne moche holy and moche pleasaunt vnto god / as for to praye o∣ne for an other. For oftentymes god pardonned
the one by the request & supplycacyon of the other. In lyke wyse as it appyred by the holy scrypture / where god sayth vnto Moyses. Suffre me & I shal destroye this people for the synne of ydolatrye / asDimitte me vt ita sca furor me{us} cō∣tra eos & deie &c. & moyses n din∣sit q̄re de{us} nō dele¦uit. exo .xxxii. ca.

Also by the prayers of Danyel the people of god were delyuered from the captyuyte of Babylon. Also by the prayers of Danyd the aungell the whiche by the commaun∣dement of god put the people vnto deth and de∣struccōn incontynent cessyd. Also by the prayer of holy chirche / that is to knowe of those the whiche were baptysed. Saynt Peter was myraculously vnchayned and delyuered from pryson. For it is wryten in the dedes of the appostles that the chir∣che prayed for hym without cessynge / and it was fygured how that by the deuoute orysons of holy chirche poore synners the whiche them submytten vnto the sacramentes and prayers of them ben de¦lyuered from prysons and boundes of the deuyll of helle the whiche holdeth them bounden by the cordes of theyr synnes.

Saynt Poule receyued the syght the whiche he had loste and was baptysed. By the vertue of prayers these deuylles ben vaynquysshed / fortunes / sykenesses / warres / and pestylences cessen. By prayer these pa¦tryarkes / these prophetes / martyrs / and other sayn¦tes / haue chasyd these deuylles / helyd the syke / rey∣sed the deed / conuerted these ydolatrers. To praye for his enemyes is a thynge of grete perfeccyon /
and he foloweth Jhesu cryste the whiche in deyngeDūe ne statuas il∣lis hoc petm̄. actu. vii. prayed god the fader to pardonne them that made hym to deye / and in this folowed hym saynt Ste∣phen. And who so is well enlumyned he shall kno¦we clerely that euery good crysten man ought for to praye for them vnto hym done Iniurye as for them the whiche vnto hym gyuen mater to entre with Jhesu cryste in to the realme of paradyse / in to the whiche none may entre wtout trybulacyon. The .xij. maner of almesdede spyrytuell is to offreOportuit pati cri¦stū & sic utrare in gam suā. luce vlti. Item actuū .xiiii. Opʐ {per} multas tri∣bulatōes introire in regnū dei. or to make offrynge vnto god the fader the blessyd Jhesu cryste his sone wt the ryght holy sacrament of the awter / and this almesdede here surmounted syngulerly in two thynges / all these other good de∣des that may be sayd or thought / that is in dygny¦te & in generalyte. In dygnyte / for than is offred the very sone of god / vnto whome ben all the trea∣sours of the dyuynyte / and all goodes / ben they of nature / of grace / or of glorye. There is the brede / and the wyne / flesshe / and blood / the ryght holy re¦feccyon of crysten soules. Also this almesdede is ryght generall as well vnto ye quycke as vnto them that ben departed / for it is the pryce & the redemp∣cyon for an hondred worldes yf there were so many the whiche wolde vnto that submytte theyr fayth and theyr hope.

By this oblygacyon he is bro∣ken / the deuylles surmounted / the vertues purcha∣sed and gyuen / the holy goost sente / and the yate of paradyse opened / and by the werkes of the infy¦nyte mercy of the blessyd Jhesu cryste. Vnto who∣me be honour in the worlde of worldes. Amen. And this is as vnto the werkes of mercy. ¶Thus endeth the thyrde partye. ¶Here foloweth the fourth partye of this boke in the whiche is foūde ye maner hȳ well to confesse / & it conteyneth .xxx. chapytres. The whiche well stu¦dyed and put in practyse / may be the meane for to make a true and a parfyte confessyon. And by the consequent to haue absolucyon and remyssyon & specyally saluacyon with the company of fayth∣full crysten men.
EVery persone that wylled & desyred to make good examinacyon of his conscyence for en¦terly & perfectly hȳ to confesse he hȳ ought examy∣ne by the doctryne drawen in these thre partyes pre¦cedentes. That is to knowe of the artycles of the fayth. Of the cōmaundementes of the lawe. And of the werkes of mercy. For in these thre poyntes is conteyned the dede of the conscyence / by the whi¦che a man shall be fynably Juged vnto saluacion or vnto dampnacyon. And therfore to the entente that symple people may haue mater and doctryne of well & surely to examyne the dede of theyr con∣scyence / there shall be fyrst put some thynges gene¦rall touchynge the sacrament of confessyon. ¶Here folowen .iiij. reasons for to shewe yt yt Justy
fycacyon of one synner / is more greater thyng thā the creacyon of the worlde. AFter the sentence of gloryous saynt austen to reduce a synner from the estate of mor∣tall synne / vnto the estate of grace / is a more grea¦ter thynge after some consyderacyon / thanne was the creacyon of heuen and of erth / and that may a man shewe by foure reasons. The fyrst is / for the soule yewhiche is by his synne in ye estate of damp¦nacyon and perdycyon / is more noble and more dygne syngulerly / For as moche as he is create vn¦to the ymage of the blyssed trynyte / the whiche is not the sonne / the skye / and all the erth / by the whi¦che it foloweth that to brynge one suche creature from the estate of maledyccyon & of dampnacy∣on vnto saluacyon / and vnto the royalme of para¦dyse is a more greater thynge than is the creacyon of the thynges before sayd. The seconde is suche for as moche as god demaundeth not to be ayded vnto the creacyon of the soule / nor of all the world but he myght not nor wolde not vs reduce frome dedely synne vnto the estate of grace / without the ayde and consent of our free wyll. The thyrde rea¦sonQui fecit  ine te nō saluabit te si¦ne te. Augustinus is / For in the creacyon of the worlde god foūde no lettynge nor resystence / but vnto the Justyfyca∣cyon of the conscyence / the synne repugnethe vnto the grace of god: The fourth reason is / for whan god created all the worlde / he sayd that heuen and erthe be made / And at his sayenge and pleasure al was made and formed for too reduce oure soules frome synne vnto grace / he is excessyuely humyly∣ed
/ And by the space of two and thyrty yeres and thre monethes he hath endured fastynges / prayers paynes / swetynges. and labours / & hath ben boun¦de / spytte on / stryken / and crucyfyed / And fynally hath shedde all his precyous blode / And hath wyl¦led to dye on the crosse / And all that hath he done for to delyuer oure soules from synne / And for to brynge them vnto saluacyon. ¶ Here foloweth a profytable exortacyon for to do wylfully penaunce. A Man ought well to note that there is notCaplm .ii so greate a synner in the worlde but that he may recouer the grace of god / yf he wyll do that that is in hym / for god is of so greate pyte & mer∣cy that he may not fayle vnto his creatour the whi¦che doth that / yt in hym is / wherfore it is to kno∣we that by the lyght of reason naturall. And specy¦ally of that the whiche is ayded with fayth and en¦formed / That is to vnderstonde that the synner y• whiche is contrary and dyspleasaunt vnto all rea¦son / Also he may consyder the Justyce dyuyne / the whiche may not sufferre but ye synne were ponys¦shed / And of this consyderacyon / and comparysō of synne vnto the Justyce dyuyne the whiche is in fynyte / And by the consygnet to offende infyny∣tly by synne procedeth and comyth fere vnto ye crea¦tour reasonable culpable and subgecte vnto synne / But howe be it he ought not alwayes to abyde in that consyderacyon / for that sholde be meter hym
too dyspayre / As were Cayme / and Judas / But more ouer he ought to consyder / the bonte / pyte / & mercy the whiche ben in god infynyte / by the why¦che he abydeth the synner / and defferreth his deth to the ende that he may vse yf he wyll of the con∣syderacyon beforesayd and that he may do penaū¦ce / And of this consyderacyon of mercy comyth an hope agayn god our fader the whiche is fountay∣ne of mercye and of all consolacyon / And by the meane of these two thynges / That is to knowe fe¦re on that one partye / and hope on the other / co∣myth a purpose and desyre to do penaunce the whi¦che purpose comyth prȳcypally of god by a remor∣ce of conscyence that god gyueth vnto the persone / or by a lytell / and inclynacyon naturall or by a pre¦dycacyon / or by the counseyll of a gode confessour or by other vocacyon semblable / And thenne they the whiche dyspose them to receyue and obey vnto that inspyracyon receyuen true contrycyon of theyr synnes / And by the consyguent the grace of the ho¦ly gooste / But they the whiche it refusen in dyfer∣rynge from daye to daye / from month to month & from yere to yere makynge a defe eere / the whicheManda remd expecta reexpect modici hic modi∣cū ibi hic. xviii. ¦ror ill sed simi¦litudinē serpētis sicut aspidis sde et obturantis a∣es suas. p̄s. v. by so often tymes / And also contynually stryketh at the yate of theyr conscyence / yelde them vnkyn¦de & indygne of the loue of god & of his royalme / by the whiche they abyde in the temptacyon of the deuell Justely reseruyd vnto the fyre of hell.

The fyrst is illumynacyon of the soule for thre thynges / fyrste for the confessyon is not true yf the synner take no payne to thynke on his synnes / and to knowlege his defaute / and his blame / And therfore sayth a man comenly / he that loketh in a glasse seeth hym selfe well / and he that seeth hymself well / knoweth hymself well / And he that kneweth hymself well preyseth hymself lytell / And he that preyseth hym¦selfe lytell is a wyse man / Secondly for that / that the synner hym humbleth before the preest for the loue of god / some tyme the kynge the pope / before a poore chapelayne / by the which god hym geueth the lyght of grace / Thyrdly for the instructyon yt the good confessour geueth vnto the synner / for ma¦ny ymagen of venyall synne that it be mortall / or some tyme of mortall that it be venyall / or that it be no synne / The seconde fruyte is ye mercy of god of the whiche sayth saynt Barnardyne that god hath two courtes / That is to knowe the courte of mercy / And that other of Justyce / That of mercy is moche swete and gracyous in comparyson of yt of Justyce for foure reasons / The fyrste is for as moche as the Juge of this court is swete and amya¦ble ageyn the synner the whiche is culpable / The seconde for in this court a man byleueth withoute ony thynge agayne sayenge vnto culpable / The thyrde / for alwayes in this court is gyuen lyberte
and delyueraūce. And ther is neuer gyuen sentence of deth. The fourth for that / that he y• whiche had deserued the gybet of hell / is assured of the royal∣me of paradyse. Also for as moche that from the court of Justyce / a man may apele vnto the court of mercy durynge this present lyfe / and not after an example of dauyd of mary Maudelayn of saȳt peter / and many other synners. And also it coūsey¦leth saynt Austen / and many other holy scryptu∣res. The thyrde fruyte is that the synner is arysen from deth spyrytuall / vnto the lyfe of grace / For after that a man hath synned mortally / man may neuer retorne vnto grace / but by the meane of con¦fessyon / and how be it that he the which hath true contrycyon and dyspleasur / of his synnes / he is by that in the estate of grace before that he hath ma∣de actuell confessyon. Neuerthelesse it behoueth yt he haue purpose that to do in place and in tyme or elles he may not haue grace.

The .xii. fruyt is that the synnerItem oe .vii. i {per}sona confessoris dt. Da gloriā dn̄o deo israel & cōfit¦re at{que} in dica mi∣chi qd feceris &c. by his true confessyon geueth glory & praysynge to god / for that that he hym knowlegeth and confes∣seth a synner before god / and by the consequent he knowlegeth the Justyce dyuyne to be true / and in fallyble in the whiche he gyueth glory & praysynge vnto god vnto whome alonely it is due in heuen & in erth. ¶Here foloweth the dyfference of werkes done in synne or in the grace of god. AFter true confessyon the goode werkes theCaplm .iiii whiche before were deed / and without me∣ryte / ben lyuely & merytoryous / They the whiche ben done in the estate of grace / ben sayd to be loue¦ly for as moche that they shall be rewarded eternal¦ly / yf the persone be fynably saued / & yf after such good werkes he fall in to dedely synne. For y• why¦che afterwarde he doeth true penaunce / the meryte of those good werkes the whiche weren mortyfyed and effaced by reason of the sayd synne vnto hym is yelden and restored by the vertu of true penaūce. But so is it not of good werkes done in dedely fȳ∣ne / as shall be fastynges / almesdedys / prayers / or o¦ther goodnesses / for notwithstandynge that ye syn¦ner shall do penaunce and shall be fynably saued. he shall not be rewarded of meryte essencyall / for those werkes done in dedely synne. For they were neuer lyuely nor pleasaunt vnto god / and by the cō¦sequent they may not be araysed / by the whiche a
man may certaynly say that it is more worth vnto a persone for to gyue a peny in the estate of grace / or to fast one daye for the loue of god / than to gyue all the golde of the worlde in the estate of dedely sȳ¦ne / or to fast all the dayes of his lyfe / with brede & with water. In the whiche apereth a merueylous dyfferrence bytwene the estate of dedely synne and the estate of grace. But that not with stondynge where as the synner hath many of synnes of asmo¦che he hym ought to enforce to do good werkes for by that he is often preseruyd for to fall into other synnes also it hym dysposeth ableth to contynue in good werkes and lyfe vertuous / Also yf suche vnto hym haue ben enioyned by penaūce / it hym acquy¦teth of that penaunce / after the moost hole opyny∣on / Also he occupyeth the tyme fruytfully / & hym maketh som what takynge parte with these good persones / Also it auoydeth paynes temporall / the whiche oftymes comen by cause of synnes he deser¦ueth agayne the grete lyberalyte of god prosperyte & godes tēporall / also they letten ye deuyll yt he hath not so grete puyssaūce to noye ye synner also they re¦lesen ye paynes of hell or purgatory / y• is to knowe yt a man shall not beso moche punysshed as at such tyme yt a man shold do suche good dedes / he hath ben ydell / they prouoken the mercy dyuyne / for to gyue grace / by y• whiche a man may go from his sȳne / & yf suche persones be fynably saued he shall haue ioye eternall of those goodnesses done in the estate of dedely synne / not as suche nor soo greate as yf that he hadde theym done in the estate of gra¦ce. For good werkes that be done for ye loue of god
stere put and knocke at the yate of mercy dyuyne / after as it is sayd in the gospell / And this mater de¦clareth ryght a longe saynt Bernardyn in the thre score and foure sermon of the somme / the whiche is intytled de contracti{bus}. ¶Here foloweth .vi. reasons shewynge that no sin¦ner ne ought to tary hym to confesse. THe fyrst reason is / wherfore no man oughtCaplm .v. to tary hym to confesse is for the condycyon of synne / for it is lyke vnto fyre brēnynge the why¦che may not be quenched but by trewe cōfessyon in the whiche he ought to haue abundaunce of teerys at the leest spyrytuell the whiche ben sorowe and dyspleasure to haue offended god by synne / And in lyke wyse as he sholde be holden a fole the whiche seeth his house brennynge / and he it may remedye by the castynge on of water / and he nothynge wyl do / soo is it of them the whiche ben in dedely syn∣ne / and putteth not theyr dylygence to purge them by trewe confessyon. The seconde is for as moche that synne is a ryght perylous syknesse / and con∣fessyon is a ryght certayne medycyne and proufy∣table / by the whiche it apperyth that full fewe prey¦se the helthe of theyr soule / the whiche seeth hym selfe syke and nere deed / and fyndeth not the reme¦dyes to make hymself hole / The thyrde reason is for as moche as the dethe is nere the whiche in all places vs purseweth and there is no persone that may knowe ye houre / after the comen lawe ne the houre ne the day / the maner or how he ought to dye
And ryght often it happeneth that the deth taketh the synner / wherof he taketh no hede. And certayn yf ony knewe the daye of his deth / he sholde be mo¦re assured / than he that knoweth not the daye nor the hour. And euer more he the whiche knowyth yt he shall haue no more but one yere in this presente lyfe / he sholde aredy hym to dye well / and by true and entyre confessyon / in makynge restytucyon in requyrynge pardon / in pardonnynge. In the why¦che it apperyth clerely the grace begylynge and de¦cepcyon as well of the worlde as of the deuyll the whiche bryngeth a slepe the people in synne. The fourth reason is for that / that the synner is now in the mouth of the lyon of hell / the whiche in an hor¦ryble rayge desyreth hym to deuoure / from ye why∣che peryll he may be delyuerde by true confessyon. & not otherwyse. The fyfte reason is for y• / that ye synner by his synne hath lost ye godes spyrytuall ye godes of glory infynyte / & eternall / & with yt he lo¦seth his tyme / his body / & his soule / and y• that he doth as to purchase meryte essencyall / & all these godes before sayd may he recouer by true confessy∣on. But the deuyll of hell dosyth his eeres hȳ pro¦myttynge falsely & in greate treason yt he shal lyue longe / and that he shall amende by true confessyō & this hangynge cometh vpon the dethe. And thā many of these dōme people wolde them confesse & haue true repentaunce / the whiche cometh pryncy∣pally of ye grace of god / of y• whiche grace they ben indygne or vnworthy / for whan god thē called & ta¦ryed they haue refused to come / by ye whiche of go∣de ryght he theym refuseth in theyr necessyte / and
theym sendeth vnto the galowes of helle for theyr irreuerence and iniquyte / for of as moche that he them hath the more longely abyden of as moche ought they to be dampned the more greuously / &Nisi cōuersi ue¦tis gladiū suū v∣brauit arcū suū te tēdit et parauit il¦lū. p̄s .vii. therfore sayth well holy scrypture that god holdeth his bowe bent / and draweth agayne the synners ye whiche taryen them to confesse. The .vi. reason is as vnto the regarde of mercy / & swete pyte of oure saueour Jhesu cryst the which not alonely abydeth at the yate of oure conscyence. But with that / put∣tyth / knockyth / and callyth from daye to daye / yt is to knowe by inspyracyons of gode wylles / by pre¦dycacyons / by gyftes / and benyfyces / and somty∣me by syknesses / losses of godes / warres / and other flagellacyons. But in lyke wyse as the deuyll blȳ deth the synner / so he hym maketh to lose the herȳ¦ge of the vocacyon that oure lorde vnto hym ma∣keth. By ye whiche of gode ryght he vnto hym shal say at the deth / I haue called the & thou haste not wylled to come / Nowe thou callest me / and I the re¦cōmende vnto the deuyll. By these .vi. reasons ap∣peryth clerely the peryll the whiche is to defferre & longely abyde hym to confesse / for by yt many can not them confesse as in generall / for yt / that they ha¦ue forgoten ther synnes / ye whiche thynge may not be suffycyent excusacyō / whan neclygence & contēp¦te of theyr helth is cause of theyr ygnoraunce / and many doctours dowten ryghte greatly that suche confessyon is not suffycyent vnto saluasyon / andA questyon. vnto thatpurpose som maken a questyon / That is for to knowe yf that ony synner be bounde hym for too confesse in contynente after that he hathe
synned mortally / and that he hathe place and ty∣me and a chapelayne that hath power for to assoy∣le / The answere vnto that no man is bounde regu¦lerly / AndThe answer by the commaundement of holy chirche but one tyme in the yere / that is at tyme of ester / excepte in .v. cases / The fyrst is whan a man wyll receyue the holy sacrament of the awter / and that a man hath presbiterū idonium for to assoyle hym For as sayth a doctour named Rycardus de me∣dia vylla / suche a caas may be come that some the whiche hath comytted mortall synne / and hath the presence of ony preest non idoniū may receyue with out synne the holy sacrament of the awter with cō¦trycyon without other confessyon in attendynge / place and tyme / and confessoure more couenable / The seconde caas dependeth ynough of the fyrste that is for as moche as holy chirche commaūdeth that euery crysten man the whiche hath age com∣petent ought to receyue his creature at the tyme of Ester / by the whiche it foloweth that he oughte to be trewly confessed and repentaunce / The thyrde is whan suche persone shall be in the artycle of de∣the / and may haue place and oportunyte to make confessyon The fourth shall be whan ony hath su∣che synne of the whiche he may not be assoyled but of hym of whome he sholde haue the presence / of ye whiche presence is it semblable that he nor she shall not it recouere but of the yere / The fyfte shall be whan the conscyence of ony man hym prycketh or warneth / that he is holden hym to confesse incon∣tynent after that he hath cōmytted his synne mor∣tall / & that he hath oportunyte that to doo / for it is
ryght good coūseyll and sure so to do / as it it sayd before in the commaūdementes of holy chirche / al¦so another questyon / that is to knowe yf y• curateA questyon. be bounde to here the confessyons of his parysshyn¦ges as oftymes as they hym requyre. The answerThe answer he is holden of necessyte to here theyr confessyon whan they hym requyre at the tyme yt they be boun¦den them to confesse / by necessyte as is one tyme of the yere / after the cōmaundement of holy chirche / or in the artycle of deth / but yf it be more often or in other cases not necessary he shal not be boūdē of necessyte / but alonely of congruyte / as he the why∣che syngulerly ought to desyre theyr welth & theyr prouffyte / But alwayes whan he is requyred and he them wyll not or may not here / or vnto them as¦sygne not another confessour / than they haue ly∣cence for to prouyde of a confessour for that tyme / or for many tymes whan the as it shall requyre / & that confessour in lyke wyse hath power them to as¦soyle of the case as may the sayd curate also whan ony is in hate & dyscencyon with his neyghboure or wyll not doo dygne penaunce for his synnes / he is bounde to shewe it in secrete wyse / or byfore wyt∣nesse after as the case it requyreth. And yf by suche admonycyon he wyll not be corrected / he it oughte to renoūce vnto his souerayne / as is the bysshop of the dyoses / or vnto his offycyall / also he ought to praye for hym / and hym ought to recōmaunde vn∣to the prayers of his other parysshynges / and hym to name after good descressyon / & that it may be vnto his prouffyte / and vnto ye edifycacyon of his neyghbours / and whan he hath done suffycyently
these shynges before sayd. Than he may be excu∣sed before god / of the charge and of the gouernyng that he hath of the sayd parysshynges / & not other wyse / In lyke wyse as it appereth by the ryght & other holy scryptures. ¶Here foloweth the practyse that the confessoure ought to holde as well agayne hymself as agayne them that he confesseth. HOr as moch as the practyse and experyence without grete connynge ys somty me more prouff ytable than is the scyence without experyen¦ce. Here foloweth a ryght prouffytable insygnemēt of the practyse that the confessour ought to holde / as well for the saluacyon of his soule / as of them that he confesseth. Fyrst he ought to knowlege and fele in hymself / that the excusacyon of the offyce of the confessour may not be duely done nor accom∣plysshed / as vnto theffecte of the sacrament y• why¦che is to brynge agayne the synner from the estate of synne to ye grace of god / & from deth spyrytuall to lyfe spyrytuall / but alonely by the vertu & ayde of ye creatour where as it is so as for to iustefy these sȳners it is not lesse than ye creacyon of ye world / as it appereth before / By the whiche the confessoure ought well to examyne his conscyence in requyryn¦ge the ayde of the holy goost / For yf he were boūde from dedely synne he myght not vnto his saluacy on vnbynde the synner / yt he confesseth nor haue ye ayde / & knowlege the whiche vnto yt is necessary & in token of this thynge whan our lorde gaue vnto
his appostles the execusyon to confesse / he vnto thē sayd. Take & receyue the holy goost / they yt you as¦soyle shall be assoyled / And those that ye wyll not assoyle shall not be assoyled. & therfore sayen these doctours of theologie / ye they the whiche admynys∣tren solemly the holy sacramentes / as is ye baptem confessyon or other in the estate of dedely synne sȳ¦nen dedely. Also be ye confessour warned yt in suche mynystracyon he seche pryncypally ye honour & glo¦ry of god / & the prouffyte & saluacyon of soules / not ye preyse fauoure / or agayn temporall / or some other thynge sinistre not purposynge ye ryche vnto the poore / the wyse worldly man vnto these symple creatures / the fayre vnto the foule / the noble vnto them not noble / but by good & iuste cause for asmo¦che yt of one may come more grete good vnto holy chirche / or vnto the saluacyon of soules than of the other / for yf he haue poornesse of intencyon / hym it shall enayde. But otherwyse he shall be lyke vn to the candell y• brenneth in she wynge the waye vn¦to other / Also be he aduysed yt the admynystracy∣on of ye sacrament is meruayllous amonge other & grete dyffyculte / By the whiche he therin ought to procede demeurely dyscretly / & without preceptacy on in chastysynge / be it to here the synnes / to su∣che or to knytte satysfactyon and penaunce / for mo¦che better it is to examyne one or tweyne vnto sal∣uacyon / than twenty and foure noughtely. Also it is ryght expedyent specyally at this daye that whan these confessours haue the cases the why∣che with good cause were other tymes reserued
vnto the prelates for the correccyon of synners. for with grete payne may a man make ony fruyte in confessyon for the dyuersyte and habundaunce of grete and horryble synnes and of cases the whiche of them cometh as well in olde / as in yonge / as wel for the sentences of excomynȳg of restytucyons / of blasfemynges of ydolatryes & of other cases newe and in estymables the whiche neuer hath ben her¦de / or founde by scrypture / & the whiche ben at this daye founde and taken from synners by the syngu¦ler grace of god / and the meryte and good dylygen¦ce of confessours / and there ben foūde many sȳners that neuer wolde consent to be sent vnto the prela∣tes though that they sholde be euer without confes∣syon so as many sayen and affermen. By the why¦che it is not to be vnderstande / that / that the which other tymes hath ben ordayned for ye charyte / and saluacyon of soules / as ben the sacramentes and ordenaūces of holy chirche / ought to be kept vnto the preiudyce of the saluacyon of synners the why∣che thynges shall come whan the prelates the why¦che haue to answere of dede spyrytuall of theyr sub¦gectes they wyll not cōmytte theyr case and puys∣saunce in suche necessyte vnto chapelayns / wyse & dyscrete how be it that at this daye with grete pay∣ne there ben founde chapelayns suffycyent in all thynges vnto suche offyce by the which defaute ma¦ny of the poore synners go vnto dampnacyon / Al∣so ought the confessour subtylly aduyse the qualyte the offence and other dysposycyons of the synner / And then he ought to enquyre of the synnes of the whiche he may be culpable / and yf he perceyue that
the persone be yonge or other / ellys he is shamfase or to moche ferefull / he ought to shewe it swetely & affyably and there he ought to perswade from con¦fessyon / And how he sholde chese more soner to dye than euer to say or ony thynge declare of the synne the whiche vnto hym hath ben confessed. For it vn¦to hym hath ben tolde in as moche as he is the vp care of god pryncypally / and not as vnto a man / Also he ought to declare of as moche that he hym confesseth the more playnly / and the more longful¦ly / of as moche he shall loue hym the better. Also that by suche confessyon he is put out of the bon∣des of the deuyll / and auoydeth the paynes of helle and retorneth vnto Jhesu cryste for to lyue eternal¦ly. oftymes it happeneth that by suche Admonycy on man gyueth courage vnto the poore synners y• the deuyll of helle holdeth in fere to confesse them poorly & entyerly. And the confessour ought to la∣bour specyally agayne yonge people / or other sym∣ple persones and rude to tell theyr synnes. Fyrst in generall / and afterwarde moeuynge the ayde of ye holy goost he ought to dyscende vnto the partycu∣lers after that he shall haue the cause and occacy∣on by that the whiche is sayd in generall. And thē he may demaūde yf they wyll well that he them ex¦amyne to the ende that theyr confessyon may be ho¦le / & vnto theyr saluacyon in she wynge them that yf by ypocrysye or euyll thynkynge they saye not trouth in theyr confessyon they lye vnto god y• whi¦che all can and knoweth / and that suche confessy∣on sholde be more dampnable than merytoryous. and whanne that a man fyndeth ony suche symple
people the whiche promytten to say and to answe¦re truely and requyren & wyllyng that a man them examen / after that they haue sayd that / that they can / a man may not make a more brefe and sure expedycyon than by the commaundementes of god as shall be sayd here after. And a man ought to ad¦uertyse the synner that he answere not to haue do∣ne that thynge that he hath not done. As done ma¦ny the whiche answer yes syre vnto that / yt a man them demaundeth / be it trouth or lesynge / And for to knowe better to procede in suche interrogacyons the confessour ought to demaunde the estate of the persone yf he knowe it not. That is to knowe yf he be in the estate of maryage / or in the estate of the chirche / reguler / or seculer / clerke / or laye / noble / or not noble / prelate / or subiecte / and of other vocacy∣ons. And than he may forme his interrogacyons / after the synnes the whiche moost comenly aboun¦den in suche people / as vnto the people of the chirch of symony / of irregularyte / of sacrylege / of y• euyll dyspendynge of the patrymonye of Jhesu cryste / these ben the goodes of the chirche. Also of noble pe¦ple / and offycers of rauayn / vnto people marchaū¦des / offrandes / and of lyenges / vnto borges / vsury vnto yonge people / of temptacyons carnalles / and of touchynge dyshoneste and of the cyrcumstaun∣ces the whiche greuen moche▪ and of the maners and dyuers espyces / the whiche may be in one self synne and of the nomber. That is to knowe by hewe oftymes aman is fallen in to the same synne For the synner it ought to tell and confesse yf vnto
hym it be possyble / or as nere as vnto hym it may be very semblable. And so of other thynges / after the dyscrecyon / and medyfycacyon before sayd. by the whiche it appereth that the confessour ought to haue thre thynges / scyence cautelle / and dyscrecy∣on / scyence for to dyscerne the dyuersytees of the ma¦ner of synnes / cautelle for to enquyre / and to axe / questyons / dyscrecyon for to gyue and enioyne pe∣naunce / or ellys he hym dysposeth vnto grete peryl as well of his saluacyon as of them that he confes¦seth. Also he ought to warne hȳ that he confesseth that he name not / or acuse another persone thanne hymself yf the synne were not of suche condycyon that otherwyse it may not be sayd / or declared / & he ought not to dyscende to moche in partyculer in the cyrcumstaunces of synnes / and specyally of the synne of lechery / For of that may come the lettȳge of conscyence / as well in hymselfe / as in other or to moche grete shame vnto hym the whiche is confes¦sed / how be it a man may hym warne to declare his synne so parfytly that his conscyence grutche hym not afterwarde in that / that he hath not enty¦erly confessed hym / and with the cyrcumstaūces y• whiche weren of necessyte / and whan it cometh vn¦to the ende of the confessyon that the synner hath parfytly tolde and declared his synnes / by interro∣gacyons or other wyse / than the confessour oughte hym to shewe the errour / and the greuousnesse of his synnes. And also the grace that god vnto hym hath done in that / that he hath abyden hym to do penaunce / and hym to loue fynally in good purpo∣se yf vnto hym it be possyble / And in good hope of
the mercy of god / and for some case or ceason he may not hym assoyle / as for the case of excomynȳ¦ge / or that he wyll not pardonne / or seche pardonne or make restytucyon / or other cases he hym ought to counseyll the forme / and the manere to fynde his remedy / and hym to recōmaunde vnto the sa∣cred vyrgyn mary foūtayne of pyte / of mercy / and of doynge ony good dedys. For in soo doynge god hym shall the more soner helpe to fynde his reme∣dyes. Also yf y• confessour knoweth by ony sygnes or lokynges coniectures or by other waye that the synner sayeth not suffysauntly his synnes / he hym ought than to warne / not alonely one tyme but ma¦ny that yf he leue ony thynge vnto his wyttynge his confessyon is no confessyon and synneth gre∣uously. And hym ought to warne to go to another confessour / or to retorne to hym another tyme that he may haue other dyspocysyon. Also be the con∣fessour wyse and dyscrete / that he enioyne not pe∣naunce vnto the synner y• he wyll not receyue wyl∣fully and the whiche is very semblable that he shal accomplysshe shewynge hym that yf by forgytful / nesse or otherwyse / he it wyll not accomplysshe / af¦ter that / that he it excepteth and that he it may wel do he synneth greuously / and is bounden in suche case to confesse hym / Also neuer for synne secrete he ought not to gyue open penaunce. And those the whiche ben confessed ought to kepe them well that by mockery / malyce or other cursyd cause & thenne they shewe not the secrete of confessyon for in soo doynge they synne greuously / & yf ony persone hȳ
fele strongly roted in ony synne / he may be boun∣de after good dyscrecyon vnto soules payne tem∣porall / in case that he retorne vnto his synne / as is to swere without cause / of lechery / or of other syn¦ne / forDfie  pauci t  saluantur. p̄e a. it dixit ad illos con∣tēdite intrare per angustā port  dico vobis {quam} mul∣ti querēt itrare et non potuerūt. lu∣ce .xiii. somtyme many kepe theym well to retorne vnto synne / for fere of the losse of .x. shelynges / ye a peny or a halfe peny the whiche he kepeth not for the loue of god / how be it / it is a thynge pleasaunt vnto god whan the persone secheth the wayes and maners to correcte hym & to punysshe his synnes for to please god his creatour / but many ben blyn∣dyd in the knowlege of the loue of god of the gre¦uousnesse of synne and of the peryll of euyll custo∣me / of the payn of hell / and of the glory of parady¦seItem gre.

And therfore some what to vnderstonde the dyfference of synne / it is well to be noted that holy chirche hath two maner of cōmaundementes. The fyrst maner vnto vs is ordeyned duely as well agey¦ne god as agayne his neyghbour / And they ben na¦med the .x. commaundementes of the lawe / of the whiche hath ben treatyd before of the whiche it is to knowe that euery persone the which hath wytte age / and dyscressyon / and that by delyberacyon & fully consentynge or equyualent trespasseth ony of the .x. commaundementes synneth mortally / For he breketh charyte the whiche is the lyfe spyrytuall of the soule / and the meane to loue god and oure neyghbour / And he may not be excused by ygno∣raunce
/ for yf he doute in ony case partyculer tou∣chynge the commaundementes of god / he ought to be enformed by thē the whiche haue the fere of god and knowlege of the lawe / and not to put hym in ye peryll of transgressyon / and to synne mortally. for other wyse sayen these doctours of holy scrypture that suche a persone dyspyseth god and his salua∣cyon. The whiche thynge may not be in creatu∣re resonable without gylt of dedely synne. The se¦conde maner of the commaundementes ben ordy∣naunces and statutes humayne. As of prelates of holy chirche or other lordes the whiche may haue auctoryte to make lawes and ordynaunces yt these subiectes ought to kepe and accomplysshe after ye true intencyon of theyr souerayns. But the trans∣gressyon of suche ordynaūces shall not be alwayes dedely synne / yf it were not for the dyspysynge of them the whiche haue made the sayd ordynaunces or commaundement / or for to moche grete & nota¦ble exces in thynge the whiche of hymself is but ve¦nyall synne yf it were not the sayd exces or contēne¦ment.

OF the cases reserued vnto the bysshop / as well of ryght as of aūcyent custome there ben .ix. That is to knowe foure of ryght / and .v. of aun∣cyent custome. The fyrst is the synne by the which ony derke sholde be irryguler / the whiche may co∣me in four maners / fyrst whan ony man receyueth vnto his knowlege holy orders by symonye / & in suche case the pope and none other may dyspence. Secondely whan ony clerke receyueth holy orders selyngly as he the whiche is not of the dyoses nor hath not loue of his dyocesayn / suche is irryguler & yf the bysshop hath defended vpon payn of cursȳ¦ge y• none other dyoses receyue orders of hym than suche irryguler may be dyspenced / but of ye auctory

Fourthly whan ony preest acursyd of the grete curfynge suspended or enterdyted / syngeth masse in suche estate. The seconde case reserued to these byssoppes is of them the whiche brennen ma¦lycyously ony chirche / or there make the brekynge of ony dores / or the wyndowes of the vestry / of the walle / or of couerture / the whiche the bysshop may assoyle yf that before he them hath not denoūced / or made to denoūce cursynge / for yf it were so they may not be assoyled but of the auctoryte of ye pope The thyrde case of synne is / wherfore the penaūce ought to be ioyned alonely for synne grete / & horry¦ble they shall be dynulged as man slawghter & af¦ter the custome of some dyoses the synne of ye fren∣des by dyffaulte wherof theyr chyldern dyen perys∣shynge / or ben strangled in the bedde or otherwyse The fourth case reserued vnto the bysshoppes after the ryght is the synne by the which a man renneth in the sentence of cursynge / as to smyte a clerke ma¦lycyously not wrongfully / for than the absolucyon sholde aperteyne vnto the pope / other cases ther ben many of the whiche the confessour ought to be well aduysed & hȳ enforme desyrously as well by studye as by coūseyl & practyse of these lawers. The fyrst of the .v. cases of auncyent customes is homicide vo¦lūtary / the .ii. of those y• whiche falsen ye letters of ye pope / or wyttyngly vsen of suche letters false / the thyrde of them y• whiche breken y• lybertes of holy chirche / as those the whiche enforce the people of ye

prechours the whiche ben lawfully presented / noo man ought to doubte but that they may assoyle of all cases excepte these .ix. before sayd / the whiche ben reserued of ryght or of custome for gloses / or opiny¦ons dyuerses of doctours / they ought not to be re∣ceyued / ne to haue place in this mater / agayne the wyll and expresse declaracyon / of the holy syege ap¦postolycall.

Now is it so that the pope Benedic. the xi. and Eugeny the fourth they haue confermed the opynyon of Raymunde / the whiche putteth foure cases of ryght / and fyue of custome as it is sayd / & that that he hath wryten in the .vii. of the decretal∣les. That is to vnderstonde that these relygyous may not assoyle of cases reserued vnto these bys∣shoppes / that ought to be vnderstonde of them that ben reserued of ryght.

For the absolucyon of cursynge apperteyneth of ryght vnto these bysshop¦pes / excepte these the whiche ben reserued vnto the holy fader. Also it is well to be noted that the preste the whiche receyueth wyttyngly the persone acur∣sed of the grete cursynge to here the offyce of ye chir∣che or ony of the sacramentes / or sepulture ecclesy∣astycall synne mortally / and is suspended of all ad¦mynystracyon ecclesyastycall / and he is enterdyted

Also yf ony take parte with these excomunycate / in spekynge / or in etyng or in drynkynge / or in gretynge them / in dyspysȳ∣ge the prohybycyon of holy chirche / he synneth mor¦tally / & is acursyd of the lasse cursynge / of the why¦che sentence he may well be assoyled of his curate / yf of suche case he hath contrycyon suffycyent / and these doctours sayen that suche absolucyon / of the lasse excomunytate ought to procede the absolucyō sacramentall of other synnes vnder suche forme / Ego te absoluo a sentencia minoris excomunicaci¦onis siue minorum excomunicacionum / et hocsi sit plures Item eadem auctoritate / Ego absoluo te a peccatis tuis / In noe patris et fil et spiritus san¦ti amen) And the reason to holde this forme / is for as moche that they the whiche ben in some senten∣ce / be not parteners of the sacramentes of holy chir¦che / from whome the sacrament is enhybyt tyl vn¦to that / that they ben loused of the sayd sentence / In lyke wyse as it appereth by the ryght. Also it is to be noted yt some may well be assoyled of pay∣nes canonycalles / as ben excomunye / suspencyon / interdyte / or irrygularyte / without that / he were as¦soyled sacramentally / of his synnes / & of the one of the sayd paynes abydynge boūde / of other yf he were bounde of many / but so is it not of the abso∣lucyon sacramentall / In the whiche he behoueth to be assoyled of all his synnes / or of one / The cau∣ses and reasons wherfore a man may not comen with these that ben acursyd without ennynge in ye

I shall me remembre / & I shall thyn¦ke on my lyfe before the face of my god / in bytter¦nes and dyspleasure that I haue hym offended / & euery persone ought to put also grete dylygence &Recogitabo tibi ōs annos meos in amaritudine aie mee ysaie. xxxviii payne to remembre hym of all his synnes / for to haue dyspleasure as he sholde be for to thȳke a gre¦te gayne temporall / or as he sholde be to kepe him from losse / for yf by sloweth & neglygence to thyn¦ke of his synnes / he leueth one / or many with oute confessynge / and yf he dye in suche estate there is ex¦treme peryll of dampnacyon / A nother thynge it shall be whan he hathe done his delygence after ye debylyte / of stragylyte humayn to remembre hym of all his synnes / and▪ that notwithstondynge su∣che dylygence / he forgetteth one or many / for it is a conclucyon certayne that euery persone the why¦che doth that / that in hym is to remembre hym of his synnes for to haue dyspleasure / god hym shall gyue knowlege / or thē hym shall pardon as vnto
the peryll of dampnacyon eternall / In the whiche it appereth that no persone is dampned but by his owne defaute. The seconde thynge that y• synnerTanta ē offensa {quam}tus ē ille  offen ditur. arist. v. ethi ought to do before his confessyon is to haue dys∣pleasure of euery synne yt he hath cōmytted ageyn god his creatour / and he ought to be certayne that the offence of euery dedely synne / is as grete / as is the maieste and boūte of hym the whiche is pryncy¦pally offended / that is god the whiche is good in fynyte. The thyrde thyng is that the synner ought to haue purpose moeuynge the ayde of god neuer to cōmytte dedely synne / for in lyke wyse as he the whiche hath true contrycyon of his synnes pryncy¦pally for the loue of god and in purpose to confesse hym in place and in tyme dewe / and competent / is in the estate of grace / In lyke wyse by the contra∣ry / yf ony creature hadde done all the good dedys of the worlde / and neuer durynge his lyfe hath cō∣mytted dedely synne / other than to haue alonely intencyon to sȳne in tyme to come / he shall be forth with by that cursyd wyll in the estate of dedely syn¦ne and in the waye of dampnacyon. The fourth thynge is that the synner ought to make prayer to god his creatour / that he hym gyue to haue know∣lege of his synnes / and grace for to make confessy¦on the whiche vnto hym may be pleasaunt / & vn∣to the helth of his soule / prouffytable. ¶ Here foloweth of them the whiche may lawful¦ly assoyle as also of them the whiche may chose a confessour.
THe synner the whiche desyreth to do so ex∣cellentCaplm xii. a werke as is to puryfye hym from all synne by true confessyon and hym reduce vnto god his creatour / after these foure thynges before sayd done and accomplysshed / he ought to seche & chese a confessoure the whiche is suffycyent for to declare hym the dyffycultes of his cases / as many be of bequestes of vowes / of testamentes / of resty∣tucyons / of sentence of excomunycacyon of irrygu¦larytes / of suspensyons / or of interdytynges / and so of other agayne the cases the whiche oftymes is foūde in the dede of nscyence / For as saynt Aus∣ten sayeth / the synner sholde at the leste do for the lyfe and helth of his soule that / that he doth ryght dylygently for the helth of his body / nowe is it soo that they the whiche ben syke corporally / and prȳ∣cypally they that a man certefyeth to be in daūger of deth sechen the best medycyne and the moost ex∣perte that they may fynde for to recouer theyr hel∣the and for to escape the deth / by the whiche it appe¦reth y• the syke & hurte spyrytually of tymes of more than of a thousande mortall synnes / sholde be desy¦rous to fynde a good medycyne spyrytuall / for to eschewe the deth of helle the whiche is eternall / su¦che medycyne spyrytuall is a gostely fader or a cō∣fessour the whiche hath cunnynge suffycyent hym to examen of dyuers cases as it is sayd. Also that he hath Jurysdyccyon / and puyssaunce to assoyle the synner / for elles yf he haue not Jurysdyccyon & puyssaunce he synneth ryght greuously in y• assoy¦lynge / And also doethe he the whiche hathe with hym suche a folysshe chapelayn hym confessynge /
wyttyngly / and there he hath not the true absolu∣cyon. Also it is to be noted that vacabons the why¦che haue no resydence / marchaūtes the whiche ben out of theyr contree / pylgrymes or they the which passen the contree for to seche dwellynge may be as¦soyled of the curate of the parysshe in whome they haue deuocyon to confesse them / for in suche cases they ben of that parysshe where they abyde / as for to receyue the sacrament of confessyon / and abso∣lucyon of all these cases / of the whiche these cura∣tes may assoyle theyr subiectes / & by the consequēt these freres mynours or prechours the whiche law∣fully be presented vnto the bysshoppes / as yf it soo be that they haue of comen ryght in that power to assoyle / as haue these curates. Also in lyke wyse as the curate may assoyle his subiecte as well in hys parysshe as with out / In semblable wyse may doo these aboue sayd relegyons agayne them of the dio¦cyse where they haue be presented / otherwyse theyr preuylege shall be restaynt / the whiche thynge the ryght wyll not suffre / than whan the synner is dys¦posed as it is sayd / and he hath foūde a chapelay¦ne the whiche hath iurysdyccyon and power to as∣soyle / as sholde oure holy fader the pope the why∣che hath power pleanere and generall to assoyle all them of crystyente and of all cases without ony to be except / or the bysshop vpon all them of his bys∣shopryche of all cases except those the whiche ben reserued vnto the pope / or y• curate the whiche may assoyle his parysshynges of all cases the whiche be not reserued by ryght or by custome vnto the pope or vnto the bysshop / or vnto other preestes reguler /
or seculer / the whiche by cōmyssyon generall / or spe¦cyally / and auctoryte with lycence of the one of y• thre before sayd. That is to knowe of the pope of the bysshop / or of the curate / Also that the sayd sȳ¦ner hath loue or preuylege generall / or specyall to chese a confessour idoniū than he ought to tell and declare vnto y• confessour all his synnes euery one in pertyculer so as god vnto hym shall gyue know¦lege / and also the cyrcumstaunces the whiche may chaunge the synne in to dyuers maners. As in the synne of thefte a man ought to take hede yf he be culpable / of vseryes / of symonyes / of fals weygh∣tes / of mesures / of rauens or sacryleges / for they y• whiche wyttyngly and by malyce alonely accuse them alonely of thefte / and they haue cōmytted sa¦crylege / extorcyon / or vsery they be not well confes¦sed / but they synne mortally / In lyke wyse is it of the synne of lechery / for who so hym accuseth of for¦nycacyon / & hath cōmytted auoutry / or incest / de∣floracyon / or sacrylege / & so of these other espyces they be not confessed / & they synnen mortally / and therfore the persone the whiche is confessed ought to tell clerely his case / & yf he be sȳple y• confessour hȳ ought to declare his greef & hardnes of hys case ¶ Here folowen .x. poyntes by one of the whiche or many the confessyon may be no thynge / & also in∣struccyon for to examen well hym the whiche is in the sacrament of maryage. AFter these thynges before sayd the persone that wyll make good confessyon vnto the
helth of his souleought well to take hede vnto the¦se .x. poyntes that folowen / for by one of them / or by many y• cōfessyon may be no thynge. The fyrst is yt he be not in ye sentence of cursyng / for yf it we¦re so holy chirche hath no power hym to assoyle / of ony mortall synne / tyll vnto that / that he be loused For otherwyse he is not partener of the sacramen∣tes of holy chirche. The seconde poynt is yt the syn¦ner ought to take hede to make conscyence there it ought to be made / and not to make it where it ou¦ght not to be made. For by the defaute of these. i▪ poyntes / the confessyon may be nothynge / and oft tymes it happeneth vnto many that they make no conscyence / in the case of vseryes / of symonyes / of gyftes the whiche they make otherwyse than by ly¦berall loue. Also of cursyd wylles dysposed to syn∣ne mortall / whan they haue not put them in effect nor that they haue lefte that to do for the loue or fe¦re of god / but alonely for fere worldely or fere to∣be dampned / or elles that they haue not had place tyme & oportunyte / Also as not to haue cōplysshed the werkes of mercy in place & in tyme / as a man is boūde by the cōmaundement of god / and vpon the payne of dedely synne / ye whiche thynge is har¦de vnto symple people to vnderstonde but by y• dys¦crecyon & good aduysement of the cōfessours after the doctryne of the treatyse precedent of the wer∣kes of mercy. Also he hath no taught and correc∣ted them that a man is bounde to correcte in place and in tyme. Also whan a man oweth lawfully ony thynge / And that a man hath well power to pay it / and he vnto whome a man oweth it willeth
and requyreth to be payed / & the dettour hath not of Justyce excusacyon that he sholde not and may paye / than suche redeuable is contynually in the estate of dedely synne / and may not be assoyled yf he haue not wyll to acquyte hym as sone as he may And here appereth the culpe of many symple and ygnoraunt confessours the whiche of these cases & other semblables they do not make conscyence vn¦to them that they assoylen / who many and ofte ty¦mes owen to poore people / the whiche by the defau¦te of theyr payment ben gretely dāmaged / In the whiche case they be hlden to recompense theym / The thyrde poynt is that the synner ought to take hede that the confessyon be entyer / in leuynge no¦thynge to his wyttynge / or by defaute to doo that that is in hym / after as it hath ben sayd here befo¦re / for he that dooth not his deuoyre after as it is in the flagelyte humayne / and soo by his defaute forgoten one or many of his synnes / the whiche he ought to confesse all in partyculer / his confessyon is not hole / And in this poynt I make grete doub∣te of the confessyon of them the whiche by theyr de¦faute take no hede vnto the cōmaundementes of god / for to accōplysshe them / & for to kepe hȳ from synne & also hym to accuse & cōfesse of y• transgres¦syon of them the whiche they myght haue lerned & vnderstonde in one daye / or in tweyne for well and suffycyently them to confesse for euer all theyr lyfe. & for the more clerely to vnderstonde this peryll & this defaute a man may consyder ye persone y• whi¦che is of .xxx. yere / hath a. M. v. c. & thre score sōda¦yes in the whiche he hath ben defended all erthely
werkes that hym may lette to thynke on god and of his benefyces for to thanke hym. And also he ought to lerne these thynges necessary vnto his sou¦le and to thynke on his conscyence / and on his syn¦nes for to confesse hym worthely. And for as mo∣che as the more grete party of bodely people done yll theyr deuoure / on the sondayes and the othe feestes to thynke on theyr cōscyences / they can not be confessed as in generall where they sholde be cō¦fessed in partyculer yf he holde it not in theyr defau¦te. Nowe is it wryten as well in ryght as in reasō that none ought to haue prouffyte of his cryme & defaute / And therfore it excedeth myn vnderstan¦dynge & reason yf suche confessyons ben vylable be¦fore god / the whiche thynge I leue in the depnesses of Jugementes dyuyne. The fourth poynt that y• synner ought to take hede that he tell all that wher¦of he hath mynde vnto one confessour and not vn¦to tweyne or vnto many / for yf vnto his wytrynge he tll one parte vnto one / and parte vnto another malycyouslly he synneth mortally and he shall not be assoyled of the one ne of the other. But yf by ony case he were sent agayne vnto the souerayne / it shall suffyce to tell the case wherfore he hath ben sent agayne / so that he hath all tolde vnto the fyrst The fyfth poynt is that he ought to be aduysed parfytly yf he be redy to pardon with good herte / the yll wyll vnto them yt haue hym offended / For as sayth oure sauyour in y• euangelyste. yf we par∣don not vnto oure malefactours the rancour that we haue agayn thē god shal not pardon vs in lyke
wyse he that hath offended ony persone in worde or in dede / he oughte to requyre pardon in dede yf he be present or to be in ferme purpose that to do it  place and in tyme / whan he shall fynde oportuny¦te. The .vi. poynt as vnto regarde of people y• why¦che ben in maryage as in two poyntes. The fyrst is how they haue receyued the sacrament of marya¦ge. The seconde is of the maner how they ben go¦uerned / as vnto the fyrst it is to knowe that after the ordenaūce o holy chirche none may take in ma¦ryage his kynnesman / or his kynneswoman but that one of the party be at the leest at the fyght degre / of the whiche degrees / the broder and syster make ye fyrst / the chyldern y• whiche ben germaȳs make the seconde. The chylder of these germaȳs the whiche ben called remoued maketh the thyrde. And the chyldern of the remoued maketh the .iiii. And the remoued from the remoued maketh the fyfth / and he that is sayd y• fyfth may haue in ma¦ryage / her of the seconde of the thyrde / and of the fourth / and so consequently in lyne collaerall for neuer may ony haue in maryage hym / or her the whiche is in ryght lyne be it in assendynge / or dys¦cendynge / and yf ony be maryed wyttyngly wyth ony of his lygnage vnder the degrees before sayd / he synneth mortally / and more ouer he is acursyd And it is to be noted that by habycyon carnall in fornycacyon is caus of affynyte with all them of the lynage as well of the one parte as of the other in the same degre the whiche appertayne vno thē the whiche cōmytten suche fornycacyon / an exam∣ple. Thou conyt test fornycacyon with a womā
all hyr systers naturalles ben thy systers by affyny¦te / her neces ben thy neces / her germayns ben thy germayns. And so of other and a lyke thynge is it of the woman as in regarde of a fornycatour / & they may neuer mary with the frendes / of the one ne of the other / and yf they mary them wyttyngly they ben acursyd & they ought to be departed not∣withstondynge ony space of tyme / or of what soo euer lyne that he be comen from suche maryage a¦nother thynge it sholde be yf after the maryage le¦gytyme of some they haue company carnall / the woman of the kynred of her husbonde / or the hus∣bonde of the kynred of his wyfe / for the maryage shall not be departed. But the partye culpable fal¦leth in to suche inconuenyent that he may neuer re¦quyre the deuoyr of maryage / vnto the partye yf he be not fyrst dyspenced with / of the auctoryte of the pope but that he synne mortally. But the party the whiche is not culpable hym ought to yelde with the dyspleasaunce the whiche may fall in suche ca¦se / and than the partye culpable synneth not mor∣tally yf he haue not other dysordynaūce and so it is good counseyll that suche persone conspable suche is dyspensacyon of the pope for to eschew the peryl¦les the whiche may come by cause of suche lettynge Also he ought to take hede vnto the lygnage spyry¦tuall the whiche cometh amonge many persones by cause of the sacrament of baptem / or of confyr∣macyon / that is to knowe / bytwene the chylde bap¦tysed / and them the whiche holden / and bytwene these chyldern naturall ben they borne before or af¦ter / For the sone or the doughter of ony persone
may neuer be maryed / or marye with the chyldern naturalles of theyr godfader or godmoder but the godfaders and godmoders well may mary theyr other chyldern togyder / of whome the gossypred is not comen / many other cases he may haue by cau¦se of cognacyon legall / and of the affynyte yt men call Justyce dyshoneste openly / the whiche I passe by cause of shortnes. Also a man ought not to ma¦ry from the begynnynge of the aduent / tyll vnto ye vtas of the epephanie. Also from the septuagesime tyll vnto the vtas of Ester. Also from ye thre days before ye Assencyon tyll vnto the vtas of Pentecost And he yt dooth other wyse without dyspensacyon he synneth mortallly / and this is as vnto the fyrst poynt of the sacrament of maryage. ¶Here foloweth the examynacyon of the persone maryed. AS vnto the seconde poynt the whiche is of the gouernynge of the persone maryed in regarde of his sacrament of maryage / it is to vn∣derstonde that after as these doctours declaren the werke of maryage / may be accomplysshed in fyue maners / some tyme merytoryously / somtyme with out synne / somtyme with synne venyall / somtyme with suche cyrcūstaunces that these theologyens doubten of mortall or venyall / somtyme it is mor¦tall synne / fyrst the werke of maryage may be accō¦plysshed merytoryously whan ye one of ye partyes or both .ii. togyder ben in ye estate of grace / & theyr in∣tencyō is to haue lyne / or to yelde ye maryage ye one
with the other / or to eschewe the peryll of auoutry in hym or in her partye / and in kepynge the cyrcū∣staunces the whiche appertayne vnto the honeste of maryage / whan it is synne there is doute of mor¦tall / or venyall / the good and suffycyent confessour it may comprehende by the cyrcūstaunces of the de¦de / of the intencyon / and of the confessyon of peo∣ple maryed. But in seuen maners a man may syn¦ne mortally with her party after as declaren these doctours. The fyrst is suche whan the man also ye woman ben so moche dysordynate / that they wyl∣len by delyberacyon accomplysshe the werke of ma¦ryage / with party the whiche is not his by marya∣ge / and this case is here harde to Juge / as vnto iu¦gement humayn / But god the whiche is Juge of conscyence seeth clerely the troweth. The seconde case in the whiche he is in daunger of synne mortal is whan the one partye refuseth the other withoute excusacyon lefull. The thyrde case is whan ye man abused of his partye for to seche more greter plea∣sure carnall. The fourth whan the woman is not in dyspocysyon of her body that she sholde yelde the deuoyre of maryage and his partye the whiche hath of it knowlege is so moche vnresonable that he wyll not hym abstayn / than synneth he mortal¦ly after as sayen comenly these doctours / but the woman the whiche obeyeth agayne her wyll for to eschewe the daungers of incontynence / or other yl les the whiche may come in maryage synneth not The fyfth is whan these people maryed goo vnto theyr wyues in these grete festes / after as sayen so∣me doctours / how be it saynt Thomas sayeth the
synne is not mortall / and the deuoute doctour Bo∣nauenture / and also the doctour subtyle the scotte holden that opynyon / for the chirche he defendeth not the werke of maryage / in these feestes / but alo¦nely counseylleth that a man absteyn hym / to the ende that they be the better dysposed to praye vnto god / for of as moche as a man putteth the more his herte in pleasures carnalles / of as moche is a man the lesse dysposed to praye vnto god / and the more ferther frō his loue & they ought to make suche ab¦stynence of a comen assent / In lyke wyse as techeth saynt Poul / and yf the one of the sayd partyes wyll not absteyne the other partye there ought to obe ye without fermynge conscyence erronyous / as yf the partye beleueth that it were dedely synne to obeye in her partye in the dede of maryage in the tyme of grete solempnyte / and neuerthelesse that notwith¦standynge hym she obeyeth / than she synneth mor¦tally alonely / for as moche as she dooth contrary to her conscyence the whiche is erronyous to byle∣ue as to obeye in her partye in the sayd tyme is de∣dely synne. The .vi. whan the werke of maryage is commytted in place halowed / as is the chirche / or chirchyerde yf these partyes maryed may other∣wyse company togyders / and yf the case were kno¦wen / the chirche or chirchyarde sholde be reconsyled after the ryght. The seuenth is whan the woman is with chylde / and nere her tyme / and they haue by some experyence / or true semblable that the chylde may renne in ony peryll / & neuerthelesse by theyr incontynence they dyspose them vnto suche pareyl they synnen mortally after some doctours / and vn
to that purpose I haue founde other tymes a man maryed that by sorowe and remors of conscyence sought remedy and counseyll of that / that his wy¦fe hath hadde foure or fyue chyldern all deed fayr grete and well formed / the whiche knowe not the cause ne ye occasyon of ye dethe of y• sayd chyldern nor other cause they coude not Juge / vnder the Ju∣gement of god but theyr incontynence. for so as he sayd they absteyn them not for ony dysposycyon / or nerenesse of chyldynge that was the party / and so it appereth in many maners the estate / and ho∣neste of maryage is euyll kept of many people vy¦le and carnall the whiche oftymes there cōmytten the case of the bysshop and many wronges / of the which they make not ony conscyence nor make not ony confessyon / and oftymes god them ponyssheth in theyr lyue by as moche that they begete chyldern wronge / croked / lame / blynde / messelles / or fallyn¦ge on the grete yll. so as sayen these holy doctours and therfore a man sholde take hede and teche yō¦ge people of the honoure and reuerence / of the fere and of the obedyence that they ought to kepe in ye sacrament of maryage and how they sholde mary them pryncypally for the entencyon to haue lyne y• whiche may come vnto the holy seruyce of god / & of holy chirche. after ye example of yonge Thobye vnto whome the angell of god taught / that as wel he as his wyfe sarra them sholde absteyne from ye dede of maryage after theyr benedyccyon the espa¦ce of thre dayes and thre nyghtes / In the whiche ty¦me they sholde gyue them vnto holy orysons / and
so he dyde by the whiche he was delyuered from al pareyll and from the temptacyon of the deuyll the whiche hadde before strangled seuen husbondes y• whiche hadde espousyd the one after the other the sayd Sara / not alonely for the loue of lyne / and of the sacrament of maryage / but for the beaute of ye doughter and to accomplysshe theyr pleasures car¦nalles. And this doctryne and techynge haue kepte syns many good crysten men and well taught / of whome they ben founde in the greate benediccion of good lyne / of Joye / of consolacyon / and of lon∣ge lyfe. The seuenth poynt is that the confessyon is not merytoryous nor suffycyent / for to aske new¦ly the grace of god whan it is done pryncypally by custome / or for fere worldely / and not pryncypally for the loue of god / and of the saluacyon of ye soule the whiche thynge is done moost comenly / so as it may be comprehended and arguyde by the lyfe of the more parte the whiche with grete payne them represent one tyme in the yere and ryght late before theyr confessoure. The .viii. poynt is whan the sȳ¦ner hath no wyll nor ferme purpose / to ceas and to put ende in his synne / for the tyme to come / and to fle the occasyons of mortall synne. The .ix. is whā the synner cheseth vnto his wyttynge for his con∣fessour a symple chapelayne / the whiche is not suf∣fycyent nor idoniū / for to redresse the dede of his cō¦scyence / after the vocacyon and estate / of the why∣che the synner may be / or the whiche hath not po∣wer to assoyle. The .x. is whanne that the synner hathe forgoten by his neclygence his penaunce
enioyned / or elles he wyll not do it / be it to requyre pardonne / or to pardon / be it to restore another / to faste / or to make prayer / for in suche case the con∣fessyon is none / and ought to be withdrawen / and so it is good counseyll y• a man accomplysshe hys penaunce in the estate of grace / for in soo doynge he seheth grete meryte agayne god / and with that a man acquyteth hym of temporall payne. ¶ Here foloweth the practyse that he ought to hol∣de the whiche entyerly hym wyll confesse / and exa∣men after the order of the .x. commaundementes of the lawe after the mooste sure maner that there may be founde. WHo so euer wyll well and parfaytly examēCaplm xiiii. his conscyence in partyculer / he ought to rule hym after the .x. commaundementes of the lawe. For so as wytnesseth saynt Austen a man may not fynde a more certayne practyse to ex¦amen well his conscyence. Also sayth well saynt Gregorye that .x. commaundementes ben as ten myrrours / In the whiche the soule crystened may clerely see and knowe the fylth of his synne and of the dysordynaunce of his conscyence. Also sayth the ryall prophete Dauyd / I shall confesse me well and ryghtly for as moche as I haue lerned the ten commaūdementes of god / by the whiche it is well to be noted that no persone is bounde hym to con∣fesse regulerly and of necessyte but onely of dedely synne the whiche is not other thynge but the trans¦gressyon of ony of the .x. cōmaundementes in the
whiche ben defended the seuen deedly synnes / Al¦so there be conteyned the seuen werkes of mercy / & the trouth of the artycles of oure holy fayth. In y• whiche thynges that is to vnderstonde in the com¦maundementes of the lawe / in the artycles of the fayth / and in the seuen werkes of mercy is compre¦hended and cōteyned all the dede of the conscyence in lyke wyse as it hath ben sayd before / And ther∣fore who so euer wyll hym well examen and make parfyte & hole confessyon after these thynges sayd he ought to take hede how he hath kepte and accō∣plysshed the ten cōmaundementes of god / as well in the thynge cōmaunded that is in sechynge ver∣tues / and in accomplysshynge the werkes of mercy as also in the thynge defended / as ben the seuen de¦dely synnes. That is to know / pryde / enuy / wrath couetyse / glotonye / slouth / and lechery / In y• whi∣che seuen maner of synnes a man may falle often mortally and dampnably And somtyme venyall alonely / for it is to byleue that euery passyon or mo¦uynge of Ire / of enuy / of vayne glorye / and soo of other synnes before sayd ben alwayes deedly synne But whan suche passyons or wylles abyden in the termes of venyall synne / or that they exceden tyll vnto mortall synne. That thynge is ryght harde vnto Jugement humayne / and it is not possyble therin to gyue a rule generall suffycyent for to Ju¦ge of euery case inpartyculer / wheder it be mortall or venyall / after as it hath ben sayd before in the seuenth chapytre of this partye / and therfore as nowe I reste to see in partyculer some case after y•
ordre of the ten cōmaundementes. ¶Here foloweth of the fyrste commaundement. OUer these thynges sayd in the fyrste cōmaun¦dementCaplm .xv. he the whiche wyll well purge his cō∣scyence ought to take hede vnto these poyntes that folowen. Fyrste vnto the brekynge of his vowes / yf ony haue ben broken / as who sayth not carynge by dyspysynge and inobedyence agayne god / the whiche was lawfull to holde / and to accomplysshe it is dedely synne / yf a man cōmytte suche fraccy / on by delyberacyon / or equyualente after the rule put in the chapytre of the scyence that a confessour ought to haue the whiche oughte well to be noted for all these cases the whiche folowen in this ma∣ter of all the ten commaundementes. Also it is to be noted that for as moche that there hath ben ma¦de mencyon in the treatyse of the cōmaundemen / tes / of all the seuen deedly synnes.

The dyspensacyon or cōmutacyon of the vowe / of chastyte / of pylgrymage vnto Jhe∣rusalem / of Rome / of saynt James ben reserued to the pope.

the sone vnder the yeres of .xiiii. may not vowe / or entre in to relegyon of theyr owne auctoryte not withstondynge what dyscrecyon so euer they may haue. Also auowe is not oblygatory yf it be not made by delyberacyon and full consent. Also a wo¦man maryed may not vowe or obserue the vowe yt she hath made before the maryage yf her husbond wyll not so consent / and yf she hath auowed after or before the maryage / the husbonde her may ma∣ke it to leue without other dyspense / and withoute the synne of ye one or of the other / yf y• husbonde we¦re not ony tyme consentynge / The man may well vowe without lycence of his partye the whiche be not vnto the preiudyce of maryage. Also they the whiche vowen neuer to kembe them on the fryday or not to spynne on the satyrdaye / or other sembla¦bles superstytucyons ought to leue suche vowes symple and full of vanytees / But doo after the ordenaunce of theyr wyse and dyscrete confessour. and other holy faders.

The one is clerely open as that before sayd. The other is hyd and is com∣mytte in dyuers maners / yf that he hath bought
londes and possessyons for lytyll / and mynyssheth the pryce for as moche that the seller putteth in his bargayne that he may bye agayne his herytage wt in certayne tyme / he cōmytteth vsurye yf he rebate not that / that he hath receyued ouer the costes and layenges of ye sayd herytage / yf he sell many tymes the more harder / for that that he leneth in abay∣tynge his payment tyll vnto a certayne tyme / how be it some what he may sewe more specyally whan he loueth better to haue vpon the ower a lesse pry∣ce than to tarye / Also whan he hath bought certaȳ ware as corne / or wyne / the whiche ben yet for to gadre / and for as moche that he hath auauncyd yc payment he gyueth lesse than the thynge is worthe at the ower / or at the tyme that he it sholde receyue it is vsery. Also whan he leneth pryncypally for the intencyon to haue presentes / money / ayde / or other thynge temporall / it is vsurye / yf he hath be∣taken bestyall vnto haluys by suche condycyon / yt yf there happen mortallyte or other aduenture of losse / wherof he the whiche them taken is not the cause / neuertheles his catyll shal be euer more sauf and entyer / it is vsury / and for a rewle generall al¦wayes as in suche contractys / be it of shepe / of lā∣bes / of the hyre of oxen / or of other bestes that the one of the partyes maketh his pryce and paccyon in suche maner that he is assured to wynne or no∣thynge to lese what so euer that there happen / and the other partye abydeth in doubte and subiecte to the aduentures of fortune / suche cōtracte is agayn reason and agayne Justyce / but whan the exces of the one partye / or of the other is suche that with
greate payne he may be in losse / or in gayns soo yt they entende no fraude the one vnto the other. I put that euery of them awayte vnto his owne prof¦fyte / here is none vsurye / yf the procurer or tuter of ony faderles chyldern gyueth theyr fynaūce vn∣to vsury to the ende yt the sayd fynaūce vnto them shall prouffyte / and that by that meane / they were nourysshed or theyr maryages augmented / and also that poore marchaundes by suche meane that them myght auantage / that notwithstondynge / it sholde be deedly synne / and to the sayd procurou¦re / or tutour is bounde to restore the sayd vsurye in case yf they the whiche haue hadde the prouffyte / wyll not restore. In lyke wyse as they there ben pryncypally bounde. Also it is well to be noted yt many sellers and byers ben full of vsurye / before god and after good conscyence as well for the cause of the entencyon of the beynge / as also of the sellyn¦ge / the whiche alwayes semen to be lawfully solde after the forme of the contracte and of the wordes / as for example Martyn hath necessyte to fynde an hundreth crownes for to lene / but he seynge and knowynge that no man hym wyll do that pleasur he cometh vnto Petyr vnto hym she wynge his ne¦cessyte / by the whiche he is dysposed to selle hym. xl shelynges of rente vpon his herytage / by suche con¦dycyon that tyll vnto the terme of seuen yeres / as many tymes and as often that he shall yelde the somme lent / that is an hundreth crownes Peter is hounde hym to delyuer his herytage / In suche ca∣ses and semblables the intencyon and the condycy
ons of the seller and of the byer sholde be weyed & consydered for yf the seller hadde not intencyon yt these .xl. shelynges sholde abyde for euer vnto the byer / the whiche entencyon ye byer knoweth or vn∣to hym it is very semblable by some meane. Also of his party he wylled and desyred that the contrac¦te were made vnder the forme of sale / and not of wynnynge / vnto y• that without knowlege of vsu∣ry his hundreth crownes he may purchase vpon hym of suche contracte / and semblable may a man say that it is a wulfe couerde with a shepes skynne. That is to knowe  vsury the whiche cometh of wnnynge hyd specyally whan the seller was indy¦gent or nedy and a persone dygne of mercy. For in suche case the somme taken lened by cause of the sayd sale is suche that he sholde rebate as many ty¦mes and as often as the seller shall yelde his mo∣ney / In this mater to dyscende vnto all cases / con¦dycyons / and cyrcumstaunces in partyculer for to Juge certaynly that there is vsury / and deedly syn∣ne or venyall / it is a thynge ryght harde withoute the grace especyall of god / for the malycyous aua∣ryce of erthely people hath so many founde of eauil lacyons that with grete payne there may go out of the waye all the moost gretest and moost yllumy∣ned doctours / for the whiche cause I passe ouer frō my other cases partyculers. Also it is holden for a rule generall / as to lene money it may be done in fyue maners. The fyrste lyberally without ony in tencyon of ony retrybucyon corporall / or temporal ouer the somme gyuen / and that maner is good and charytable. Secondly with suche condycyon
that he the whiche receyueth that londe of money in marchaundysynge vnto the halfe of losse or of gayne / and suche contracte may well be made and he the whiche hath lente may receyue a more grea∣ter somme than he hath gyuen / But for the condy¦cyon of persones / or for the aduersyte of the inten∣cyon of auaryce▪ or of other / he there may haue let∣tynge.Nota Thyrdly in puttynge the chatell that is the somme gyuen in certaynte / and the gayn in certay¦ne / that is to vnderstande / that lese or wynne he y• whiche receyueth vnder suche forme / he shall yelde alwayes the sayd sōme / and yf he wynne ye bayllye takyth auantage / here is vsury manifeste. Fourth¦ly vnto the contrarye of this laste case. That is to vnderstande in puttynge the gayn in certayne and the chatell vnder incertayne / as for An example / I lene the an hondreth crownes wher with thou shalte marchaundyse at my pareyll with all the somme / by suche wyse that after a yere / or another erme thou shall yelde me syx crownes. or .x. or mo or lesse / and yf thou lese by fortune the sayd hon∣dreth crownes / vpon me it is al and yf it be sauyd he it shall yelde with the somme spoken / suche con¦tracte is full of vsury after the ryghte / the cause is suche for the hope that suche a lener hath more is more to wynne than lese. Fyfthly in puttynge the gayn / and chatell in certayne. as for an exam∣ple. I lene the an hundreth crownes by suche wy∣se that after the yere paste thou me shalte yelde an hondreth & .x. here is vsury manyfeste / vnto these v. maner to lene may be broughte all these other / But more ouer these doctours make a questyon yfA questyon.
it be lawfull in ony case to receyue ony thynge be¦cause of the lone. It is lawfull in fyue maners.The answ Fyrst a man may well receyue a thynge spyrytual as is the lone & the good grace of hym vnto who∣me he hath lente. Also yf of free wyll he gyueth o∣ny thynge or it may receyue / so that the lone hath not be made to suche intencyon. Secondely by rea∣son of dysdāmage / as yf the lone hath ben made vnder a certayne payne it for to yelde at a certay∣ne tyme / and that by the defaute of that for to do the lender were in dammage without ficcyon / in this caas he may for by cause of the dysdāmage take the sayd payne with his pryncypall yf that the sayd payne were not excessyue and vnreasona∣ble. Thyrdely by reason and cause of the doubte / vnto the whiche the lender is submysed / in lyke wyse as it appyreth in the seconde caas of the no∣table before sayd in lendynge vnto the halfe of losse or of gayns. Fourthely by reason of the dam∣mage that he renneth in the whiche lended / by cau∣se of the sayd redy. As for an example. At your gre¦te request I lende you an hondred crownes for a yere / in the whiche after god and good conscyen∣ce I shall be in dammage in the somme of ten or twenty crownes. Than yf he the whiche borowed seeth that it sholde be better vnto his prouffyte to take the sayd somme and to restore the dāmage of the lendynge he it may do / & the other it receyue o∣uer the pryncypall for to kepe hym / & to recompen¦se hym the dāmage. Fyfthtly by reason of the hyre of a thynge the whiche he may hyre / as oxen / hor∣ses / and other thynges that a man may receyue /
some tymes more in valour that they were at the tyme of the hyre / and with the hyre. But for to re¦ceyue more than a man hath lente in ony other maner wyse than here before hath ben sayd or do¦ne ayenst the cōmaundement and a man selleth the thynge imprecyable / and the whiche proprely may not be solde. That is to vnderstande the plea¦sure & the charyte that euery creature ought vnto his neyghbour / as well by ye lawe of nature as by the lawe of holy scrypture / the whiche lawes & all other ben they Canons or Cyuyles defenden ye syn¦ne of vsurye. Also yf ony gyne olde corne or other thynge semblable for to renewe it hauynge inten∣cyon pryncypall that the newe shall be more worth and elles he wolde not gyue it he cōmytted vsurye But yf he do that pryncypally to the intente that his thynge perysshe not / or for to do a pleasure vn¦to his neyghbour / or in trewe semblable doubte yf that the thynge be more worthy or lesse at the ty∣me that it shall be yelded agayne in suche a caas it is none vsurye. The payne of vsurers publys∣shed is suche that they ben excōmunycate of ryght wherfore the holy chirche defended that vnto suche there be not gyuen the precyous body of Jhesu cry¦ste. Also that theyr oblacyon be not receyued in the holy chirche. Also that after theyr deth theyr bo¦dyes ben cast in a voyde grounde and not receyued in the place holy and blessyd. For a man ought not to doubte but that the soules of theym the whiche deyen in suche estate ben dampned with the deuyl∣les in helle / wherfore the bodyes sholde not be put to reste with the faythfull crysten men. And yf in
theyr laste dayes they requyre penaunce they may not be assoyled / but in doynge yt yt in them is possy∣ble to restore all these vsuryes yt they haue receyued in all theyr lyf / & it suffysed not to be receyued vn∣to ye sacrament{is} of holy chirche / & assoyled to orden by theyr testament yt after theyr dethes these vsu∣ryes ben restored / but it behoued to dyspose moua∣ble & herytage tyll vnto ye somme the whiche may amoūte the sayd vsuryes & yf they vnto whome he ought to make restytucōn ben present hȳ behoued them to make full satysfaccion in yeldynge it all / be it by fynaūce maruell / by gage / or assygnacōn. And yf they ben absent ye Juge of ye court or his ly∣uetenaūt / or ye bysshop / deane / or curate sholden re∣present ye persones in receyuynge the sayd satysfac¦cyon & in caas yt mouables & herytag{is} suffyse not▪ as often it happened after yt they haue all layde mouables & herytages as it is sayd / they sholde re∣quyre mercy of god / of holy chirche / & of them vn∣to whome they ben redyuables / & than a man may them assoyle & not elles. For the testament that they make in ony maner wyse is of no valour nor effecte after the ryght. Vnto that peryll is boun∣den wyues / childern / neuewes / nyces / or enherytou∣res the whiche wyttyngly retaynen the goodes mo¦uables or herytages of vsurers the whiche haue not made in theyr lyf suffycyent restytucyon or sa∣tysfaccyon / and it ought to be restored yf that it be possyble / not all oonly the somme of that hath ben receyued by vsurye but with that the dāmage that they myght haue hadde by cause of theym the whiche haue payed the sayd vsuryes / by the
whiche it apyreth clerely that full fewe of vsurers escapen the deuyll. In lyke wyse also it appyreth the peryll of those y• whiche receyuen in theyr chir¦ches or chircheyerdes vnto sepulture the body of an vsurer / suche as hath ben spoken. For the pree∣stes the whiche do it wyttyngly ben excōmunycate ipso facto after the newe ryght. Also it is to be no∣ted that he the whiche taketh vnto vsurye for his grete necessyte of hym the whiche is an vsurer re∣nommed and is redy that for to do synned not in takynge vnto vsurye / but to take vnto vsurye for auaryce / or for to dyspende folysshely / or for to en∣duce ony to gyue vnto vsurye the whiche it hath not accustomed it is a synne moche greuous. And this is shortely as vnto the seconde poynt. ¶ Here foloweth of fraude and of decepcyon. AS vnto the thyrde poynt the whiche is of fraudes and of decepcyons the whiche is cōmytted of dyuers maners of people / and in dy∣uers maners the synner sholde take hede. Fyrste in dede of marchaundyse ouer the thynges sayd of vsurye / yf he hath done fraude by fals weygh∣tes or ony fals mesures or in the sellynge of ony fals thynge corrupte or meddled in affermynge that it is good and pure be it metalles / appoteca∣ryes / wyne / oyle / or ony other ware / by the whiche the byer is notably defrauded / it is deedly synne / syns in a lytell thynge it is venyall synne. How be it / it is well to be noted that yf ony man defrau∣de and dysceyued his neyghbour in a lytell thyn∣ge
/ that he hym wolde well dysceyue in a more greter thynge yf he myght suche synnen mortally. For god that seeth all weyeth more the good wyll than the werke withoutforth. If he hath frauded & reteyned taxes serches passages / or other imposicy¦ons made by the ordynaūce of Justyce it is deedly synne. Also yf people of seygnourye & of Justyce haue made prestes taxes & imposicyons by auary∣ce or tyrannye / & not for the comen wele it is mor¦tall synne. Also yf he hath falsed bookes of recey∣te / or other lettres vnto the notable dāmage of an other it is deedly synne. Also yf the marchaūt mar¦chaūdyse pryncypally for auaryce or for to encrea¦se his catell & not for to lyue honestly after his vo∣cacyon or for to ayde the poore / or for the welth of the comunalte / it is deedly synne / whan in suche gayns he putteth his pryncypall entente. Yf ony bye stuffe or ware in intencyon for to selle them a∣gayne more derer without chaungynge them in doynge with them ony crafte / as is the corne / or the wyne / not as it sholde be by the waye for to wryte / or of wood for to make ony crafte for to selle it / or without caryenge it from one regyon in to an other for the comon welth / but pryncypally secheth by suche maner to encrease his catell suche marchaundyse is vnlawfull / and there he may ha¦ue deedly synne after as sayth mayster Fraūces de maronis. Also yf they haue made paccyon bytwe∣ne them for to selle theyr ware rudely and at a pry¦ce not competent / by the whiche the comons be constayned for to bye it at theyr pryce / it is deedly synne. Also yf he be payed with one ware for an o∣ther
/ by the whiche that seynge he hath aboue ma¦de his owne / and mynysseth and hurteth the other mortally it is deedly synne. Also yf he hath payed symple people in fals moneye / it is fraude and de∣cepcyon and deedly synne. Also yf he hath vsed fla¦terynge speche and of swerynges / to selle indyffe∣rently at the daye of the feste cōmaunded / or in ha¦lowed place often there is deedly synne. Also yf he hath bought of robbers of theues / where that he byleued the thynge to be suche that it apperteyned vnto them Justely it is deedly synne. Also yf he hath ben the meane of ony cotracte that he byle∣ued to be vniuste / as of vsurye in byenge of hery∣tage / or in corsynge of hors / or in treatynge of ma¦ryage / seynge and knowynge the greuous dāmage of the one of the partyes it is deedly synne. By these thynges beforsayd of the vocacyon and estate of marchaundyse a man may applye vnto other la∣bourers & handcrafty men / ben they drapers / tay∣lers / cordeners / weuers / tauerners / bakers / pye ba∣kers / smethes / carpenters / massons / golsmithes / la¦bourers wt theyr armes / labourers of the erthe / for in euery vocacyon there may be fraude / trechery / & malyce in theyr werke / be it in weyght or mesure / in valour / in intencyon / or in these other circum∣staūces / yf god & purenes of conscyence ne them adresse. And therfore they sholde consyder theyr e∣state & occupacyons / as well by them as by the ayde of theyr confessour / & declare the fraudes that they knowen well to do / & to speke more subtylly y• no clerke by wrytynge may them declare / & they shold telle wheder they were for to leue suche maners of
fraudes or not / & it shewe & confesse playnly / for yf they haue intencyon to retorne in cōtynuynge theyr dysceyuable maners to vse / they ne ought to be as∣soyled. Also yf ony hym medle of offyce / or crafte the whiche he may not do without deedly synne / as to at house steues syde / to do seruyce vnto these vsurers / to meue warre the whiche is not Juste / to make these mixions wherwt women paynte theyr vysages / & so of other vocacyons suche ought not to be assoyled / yf they haue not wyll neuer for to retorne vnto the sayd offyce. Also people y• whiche geten by theyr Journeys & them faynen & sparen to werke / or y• whiche in euyll wyse done theyr wer¦ke / & yt notwithstandynge wyll be well payed they ben theues & boūde to make restytucyon. As for an example. They haue promysse of .xij. pens for the Journey / & I put yt a man thynketh it suffycyent / how be it after god & good cōscyence they gete not but .x. pens / for as moche as they do not theyr Jour¦neye lawfully they ben theues of .ij. pens vpon the Journeye ye which amoūted at the ende of the yere yt a man hath made .cc. suche Journeys ye somme of .xvi.  .viij. d. of the whiche somme they ought make restitucyon. And oftyme it happened by y• Ju¦gement of god yt vnto suche people theyr goodes en¦crease not nor yet profyten / but some them dyspen∣de in tauernes or vnto them cometh losses & dāma¦ges / by ye whiche they fallen in necessyte of pouerte & of no power to restore yt the whiche sholde be wel with reason. And by suche meane ben deceyued by the deuyll without nombre / & so to do he is ayded by confessours ignorauntes the whiche assoylen su
che people without them enioynynge restytucyon / or without the counsyll the whiche vpon that shol¦de be gyuen. ¶ Here foloweth of iniquyte or defaute of Justyce. AS vnto the .iiij. poynt the whiche is of ini∣quyte or Justyce / yt is of the defaute for to do & yelde Justyce & reason vnto his neyghbour the synner ought to take hede. And for as moche as to yelde / kepe / & to defende Justyce it aperteyned pryn¦cypally vnto y• prelates of holchirche / & vnto ye lor¦des erthely after as ye Jurisdiccōn of euery of them extended & consequētly vnto these Juges / aduocat{is}. proctours / notaryes / sergeaūtes / prentyses / & wyt∣nesses of euery of these estates & maners of perso∣nes some thynge it ought here to be shewed for to examen all well / and fyrst of the prelacyon & seyg¦noury ecclesyastycall. Yf he were irreguler / suspen∣de / excōmunycate / bygame / illegittinie / or cubina¦rie open & knowen / & by y• consequens suspende at the tyme & houre yt he receyued y• dygnyte / the cure / or prelacyon he synned mortally & is contynually in deedly sȳne / & in executynge his offyce cōmytted alwayes of newe deedly synne before ye dyspence & absolucōn. Yf he hath not ben elect canonly of the college or patrone vnto whome it apperteyned or hath be / receyued / & confermed of hym yt so to do hath power / or vnto yt is come by meanes forboden suche is called after ye ryght a wronge doer & theef and yf he hath not ony maner of puyssaunce or Jurysdyccyon for to dyspose / or to make offyce of
ony thynge temporall or spyrytuall aperteynynge vnto the offyce or benefyce he synned mortally as oftentymes as he hym endeuoured to excecute that the whiche aperteyned vnto the sayd offyce or bene¦fyce. Yf he hath made prayers by hymselfe or by other for to be chosen & receyued vnto the sayd of∣fyce he is a symonyacle / & yf he hath had paccyon or couenaūt the dyspence aperteyned vnto ye pope. & before y• dyspence he holdeth theuyshly the offyce or dygnyte. Yf he suffre & dyssymule ony grete ylle in his subgectes that he may after the ryght pur∣ge & correcte it is deedly synne. Yf he hath fauou∣red ony ayenst Justyce & vnto the dāmage of the o∣ther / yf he hath lost & wasted the goodes of ye chir∣che in folysshe vsages / yf he hath rebelled ayenst reason vnto his soueraynes. Also yf he hath ben neclygent to gete good & suffycyent counseyll for to seche Justyce / by the whiche defaute the partye hath ben in dāmage. In all these thynges it is de∣dely synne. Also yf he hath put offycers indygne or vnworthy specyally in cures of soules where a man them knoweth for suche & them may wtsaye law∣fully & repelle / & is neclygent that to do it is deedly synne. Also yf he hath suffred confessours ignoraū¦tes with grete peryll & dāmage of soules the whi∣che he may vndertake it is deedly synne. Where so∣me is indygne / or to moche ignoraūt apyreth in y• chapytre of y• scyence necessarye vnto a confessour Also yf he hath ben curyous & proude in buyldyn∣ges / in heyght / in horses / harneys / abyllyment{is} / in grete & peryllous dyspences vnto the grete dāma∣ge / as well of the chirche as of y• poore it is deedly
synne. Also yf he hath ben more curyous of the tem¦poralyte than of the spyrytualyte / after the exces moche or lytell it is mortall synne / or venyall. Also yf he hath lefte to lese the ryght & preuyleges of his prelacyon / or of the benefyce after as they apertey∣nen of ryght the neclygence may be mortall. Also yf he hath dyspensed vndyscretely by the whiche they be become recheles & vnthryfty / or by the con∣trarye haue ben to harde & inhumayne to dyspen∣se / & to puruye for the enfermetes of his subgec∣tes after the exces of moche or of lytell it is mortal synne or venyall. Also he ought to be the lyght & example vnto his subgectes in all thynges / in fe∣we wordes & of thynges prouffytable in quenchyn¦ge dyscordes / in reprouynge detraccyons or bacy∣tynge / grutchynges / fals reportes / mockeryes / & fo¦lysshe langages. Also he ought to be circonspect in all thynges / & specyally in holdynge secrete ye caas the whiche happened after as it is of ryght & of charyte. Also yt he be in fere of honour & of reueren¦ce the whiche vnto hym ben done by cause of his prelacyon / for of that with other thynges before sayd hym behoued to yelde acounte. Also of the cor¦reccyon the whiche vnto hym apperteyned by cau∣se of the offyce ouer the cōmune y• whiche he ought to do with all after the lawe of charyte / of the whi¦che had ben made mencyon before. Also he is boū¦de to pastoure his shepe as a good shepeherde by good doctryne & good example / & them to defende vnto his power from the wolues rauysshynge as ben prechours that prechen pryncypally for to go with theyr syluer or other goodes. Also of tyraūtes
and extorcyoners the whiche oftentymes them de∣uouren vnto the wyttynge & knowledge of prelates And here he may haue suche exces of neclygence with these other circumstaunces that it is mortall synne. For the prelate spyrytuall ought to be the fa¦der & defender of poore people / of children fader∣les & moderles / and also of wydowes / & ought to haue specyall herte on theyr causes. ¶ Here foloweth more in partyculer of bysshopes. AS vnto the fyfth poynt y• whiche is of bys∣shopes / it is to be noted ouer these thynges beforsayd in general touchynge ye estates of byssho¦pes yt he ought to take hede fyrst vnto ye forme & ma¦ner of his entre. For yf he be not entred regulerly as before hath ben sayd he is a theef / in lyke wyse as our lorde sayth in the gospell. If he hath gyuen holy ordres by symonye in secrete wyse he is suspen¦de alonely as vnto hȳ & is in mortall synne / & ly∣ke wyse those ye whiche so ben ordeyned ben suspen¦de & vnto them it behoued to seche dispence before yt they execute theyr offyces. If he hath gyuen holy ordres wyttyngly vnto them yt haue not age to de∣termyn in ryght it is deedly synne / for he may not dyspence at the sayd tyme. If he hath gyuen ordres wyttyngly vnto ony ye whiche hath not than the which sholde precede / or to gyue ordres in an other tyme than of ryght wtout ye dispence of ye pope it is deedly synne / & he y• whiche so hath ben ordeyned is supende. If he hath lefte ony thynge to do or to saye the whiche is of the essence of the sacrament
of holy ordres hym behoued all to go backe for as moche as in suche sacrament it is create of god / & gyueth a token spyrytuall named caractere. An o∣ther thynge it sholde be / yf he lefte a thynge the whiche sholde not be essencyall / how be it a man sholde supplye in these other ordres / yt the whiche is forgoten / & y• hāgynge the clerke so ordened shol not offyce / nor there ne may ignoraūce vycyous ex∣cuse suche defautes. Yf he hath not caused to make examen of the age / of the holy lyfe / of the scyence / & of other thynges y• whiche ben requysyte of ryght in them the whiche sholde be ordeyned it is deedly synne. For by suche defaute many indygne ben re∣ceyued & ordeyned vnto the grete preiudyce of sou∣les & of all ye holy chirche. Yf he hath ben neclygent to gyue the sacrament of confyrmacyon by y• whi∣che many be deed wtout suche sacrament / & the gre¦te good spyrytuall & caractere the whiche in suche sacrament is receyued / or yf in it gyuynge he hath not kepte the forme / the mater / & the place. That is to vnderstande in y• forhede / or wyttyngly it gy∣ueth two tymes vnto one self persone. Yf the very daye of the asshes he hath not consecrate the holy creme & other thynges in kepynge there the forme and ordynaunce of holy chirche / he there may haue deedly synne. Yf he hath not consecrate in place & in tyme chirches chircheyerdes & ornementes. Also abbotes & abbesses. Also in reconsylynge chirches & chircheyerdes. In all these thynges he may haue so grete defaute & dāmage spyrytuell that it shol∣de be deedly synne. Yf he hath prouyded of benefy∣ces / be it of cures of soules / or without cure / those
the whiche were notably indygne & it knoweth or sholde knowe it is deedly synne. And in lyke wyse in receyuyng them indygne as some present by au¦ctoryte of patronage. Yf he hath gyuen prebendes or other benefyc{is} vnto his kynnesmen pryncypally for by cause of lygnage & in them preferryng them vnto them yt ben more worth it is deedly synne. Yf he hath not prouyded vnto chirches of a rectour in tyme & in the maner yt is of ryght & well possyble / or yf he hath receyued vnto holy ordres without tytle suffysaūt / or hath not vysyted his dyocyse / as ryght and reason it ryquyred in prouydynge of confessours & other mynysters / in correctynge the defautes the whiche is done ayenst the sacramen∣tes / & the offyce dyuyne / and the vyces & sclaūdres of his clergye & of his subgectes. Also yf he hath not made punycyons & correccyons after ye discre∣cyon & charyte ordeyned vnto ye ryghtes / the dāma¦ge of ye soules / the sclaūdre & these other ylles y• whi¦che cometh by ye occasyon of the defaute of ye thyn¦ges before sayd vnto hym shall be imputed & mo∣che greuous the dede of conscyence. In lyke wyse as it is well shewed by ye fygure of ye aūcyent testa∣mēt in the .xxv. chapytre of nombres. For our lorde seeynge that none ne dyde correccyon in lyke wyse as it apperteyned vnto ylle & synnes the whiche reygnen in the people of god cōmaūded vnto Moy¦ses that all the prynces of the people sholde be han¦ged on hygh gybettes / and for the defaute of cor∣reccyon deyed in one daye. xxiiij. thousande men of the people of god. Also yf he hath founde newe exaccyons for to extorcyon gyftes / promysses / or
AS vnto the .vi. poynt the whiche is of cha∣nons / curates / & other benefyced / it is to be noted ouer these thynges beforsayd of symonye / & of the estate of prelacyon that all they the whiche receyuen offyce or benefyce in the whiche to execu∣te & gouerne they haue noo connynge competent / they synnen mortally after as sayth saynt Tho∣mas in the .xviij. distiction du quart.

And therfore sayth well saynt Austyn that grete seyg∣nourye is none other thynge but grete theftes and pyllers yf Justyce reygne not & gouerne. And for a conclusyon to put in this mater cometh vnto my purpose the questyon the whiche saynt Thomas made. That is to vnderstande yf he ye whiche doth ony thynge contraryous vnto Justyce synned mor∣tally. The answere. For as moche as Justyce ordey¦ned these creatures the one ayenst the other after that it is of reason in yeldynge to euery man that that vnto hym apperteyned / to do the contrarye wyttyngly it is ayenst the charyte of his neygh∣bour / & by the consequent mortall synne / & for as moche as paradyse is promysed vnto Juste men / these vnlawfull & vniuste dwellen in helle. ¶ Here foloweth of Juges be they of the chirche or of secularyte.

In that may he haue gylte & synne in thre ma¦ners. Fyrst for as moche as that to do he hath not puysaūce or cōmyssyon of the prynce / but all oonly hath power to Juge after the lawes and customes.

And of that opynyon holdeth mayster Fraūces de maronis / saynt Thomas / & Rycharde de villa noua. Some holden ye contrarye affermynge yt the Juge sholde sooner suffre deth than to gyue suche sentence. But I ne consente to ye fyrste opynyon in the cause pecuniarie / & to y• seconde in the cause of deth or of mutilacōn. For as for to lese ye goodes of fortune is oftyme to y• grete prouffyte of the soule / but y• holy scrypture whiche may not lye forbydeth symply the deth of hym ye whiche is innocent. In ly¦ke wyse as it appyred in Exodi. By these thynges beforsayd of prelates of prynces & of Juges appy∣red the trouth of the scrypture ye whiche sayth that
Jugement ryght meruayllos shall be gyuen vnto them y• whiche preceden. That is to vnderstande yf they kepe not ye lygne & the purete of Justyce & of equyte / & therfore they ought to fere & them humy¦le before god the Juge of Juges & hynge of kyng{is}. & euery creature as moche y• more as he hath ye mo¦re grete charyte of seygnourye & of Justyce. After as sayen these scryptures & holy doctrynes / & of yt to do hath gyuen example the blessyd sone of god the fader Jhesus nazarenus ordynarye Juge of the deed & the quyke. And therfore whan a man wolde take hym for to make & constytute hym kynge he fledde in to a moūtayne to praye vnto god the fa∣der / but whan man hym sought for to Juge & to put hym vnto deth he hym yelded & presented vn∣to the towne & vnto the place where he knowe wel that men hym sholde cause to deye. In lyke wyse as he wolde saye by an example that moche more Joyously sholde many receyue the deth than prela¦cyon / offyce / benefyce / or seygnourye. By the occa∣syon of seygnourye & of prelacyon cometh many tymes vnto them of suche estate foure ylles. In ly∣ke as it appyred by these scryptures. The fyrst is pryde and elacyon / by the whiche proude men of good ryght be compared vnto bestes. For of the thynge wherof he hym sholde humyle / he hym en∣haunced and enpryded. The seconde ylle is the oc∣casyonNoli ree fieriu¦der nis valeas vir¦tute irrūe inra¦tē ne forte extune seat faciē potēt. eccl. vii. gre Hoc si hoīes attēr ∣latōes nō airt of the more grete dampnacyon / for as it is sayd before the Jugement of those the whiche haue had prelacyon shalbe ryght strayte. The thyrde is  in receyuyng prelacōn he hȳ byndeth to answere & to yelde accompte of his synnes & of his subiect{is}
The fourth is the slaūder of his subiect{is} the whi∣che cometh whan ye Juge or the prelate gyueth not the correccōn & doctryne ye whiche aperteyned vnto the offyce or seygnourye. And therfore sayth well saynt Gregory yt yf these men resonable knowen ye charge the whiche is ye prelacyon they fere & neuer haue appetyte it to receyue / for as it apyred by the fygure the whiche is in the .xxv. chapytre of ye bokeIt{us} ds dixit ad moysē. tolle cūctos ipes ppl & sus∣pende eos tra so∣le in patibulis &c. occisi sunt. xxiiii.  oim Nume . xxv. ca. of nombres. xxiiij. thousande men of the pryncypal les of the people of god deyed in one daye for the defaute of good presydentes & of good correccyon. The whiche thynge was fygured of all those whi¦che after the example & doctryne of Jhesu cryst pre¦sumed in pryde & in abusynge of theyr vocatōn / in the whiche is reserued moche cruell dampnacyon. But also by the contrarye those the whiche in fere & humylyte there do that the whiche vnto them is possyble / after god and good ordre of Justyce they shalbe ryght excellently rewarded. And this suffy∣sed as now of the holy estate of prelacyon. ¶ Here foloweth of aduocat{is} / {pro}curours / notaryes. ben they in ye courte of the chirche or of secularyte.

If he hath sought dylacōns & cauyllacōns ayen ryght / or for to gyue costes & vexacōns to ye partye in the cause ye whiche was not Juste / yf he hath ap¦peled of Juste sentēs wyttȳgly. In al these case may he haue mortall synne.

Also to take or to gyue moneye for lycence for to leue ye lecture in ony daye of feest ye whiche is of ye cōmaūdement of the chirche it is symonye.

If he haue gy¦uen euyll example he ouggt to gyue good. Also he ought to praye for ye conuersacōn of ye persone yt he hath made to synne in recōmaūdynge hym or her vnto god & to these holy persones / for in suche case
a man hath more sooner stryken downe than rele∣ued. And saynt Austyn sayth yt he the whiche doth not his deuoure for to restore in y• caas & in the ma¦ner beforsayd may not haue remyssyon. If he hath dyffamed his neyghbour in puttynge on hȳ cryme whiche is not trewe he it ought to reuoke before y• persones to whome he hath tolde y• sayd cryme spe∣cyally / yf he byleue yt by his wordes they be sclaū∣drers of y• persone to whome he hath imposed y• cry¦me / & also yt he may do it conuenyently.

And saynt Gregorye sayth yt not∣wtstandynge that he ye whiche is accused openly of the thynge whiche is secrete he it may denye after the maner that suche caas vnto hym is imposed. How be it so he it ought to confesse & to make sa∣tysfaccyon / and so he ought to repayre the honour of the imposaūt vnto his power not in auowynge that he hath sayd trouth / for a man may well so∣me tyme holde his peas of the trouth / but not to telle a lye. But he may and sholde speke seme wor¦des sobre and couered / as in besechynge the herers that they be not euyll dysposed or euyll content of the imposaūt / for he ymagyned to haue power to proue cryme that he imposed. And for to abredge this mater it suffysed as now / for these grete and subtyle doctours with grete payne and dyffyculte determynen the mater of the myserable synne of fals & enuyous langage. But many confessours ta¦ken but lytell hede and therfore they put not the re¦medye and the restytucyon the whiche is necessarye & that proceded of theyr ignoraunce & of the synne of detraccyon the whiche is at this daye to moche comon. And therfore sayth well the holy scrypture that by the synne of fals langage almoost all the worlde perysshed / for with grete payne and also as of the lest parte of that is made trewe restytu∣cyon. These thynges beforsayd sholde be vnderstā¦de of cryme the whiche is a grete mortall synne / for yf ony man hath despysed his neyghboure by the whiche he myght be the lesse praysed / he hym
ought to prayse & honoure dyscretly as well ayenst hym as ayenst other. And this may suffyse for to repayre the dyspysynge that he vnto hym hath do ne before. ¶ Here foloweth of the restytucyon of goodes as vnto the body. AS vnto the restytucyon of the goodes of na¦ture is to be noted that some may be endā¦mage in his body in thre maners. The fyrste is whan a man taketh from hym his lyf. The secon¦de whan a man taketh from hym ony or many of his membres. The thyrde is in betynge hym & hur¦tynge wtout sleynge hym or wtout depryuynge hȳ from the vsage of his membres. Restytucyon for the deth of ony persone may not be foūde more su¦re or more certaynet han yt the which is ordeyned & taxed of god in these holy scryptures as well of the auncyent testament as of the newe. That is to vn¦derstande he the whiche hath done homycyde recey¦ue in gree & inpacyence the deth the whiche vnto hȳ shall be gyuen by Justyce. But yf suche penaunceOs  gladiā acce¦perint. gladio pe∣ibūt Math. xxvi. ca. vnto hȳ be not gyuen / or for as moche yt the dede is secrete / or for as moche yt he asketh his grace of the prynce the whiche vnto hym it may do & gyue. The moost certayne penaūce after that beforsayd shall be yt he amende his lyfe in desyrynge to deye for the fayth comonly ayenst these myscreaūtes / by suche dyscrecyon euermore yt he slee not hymself / or cause to be slayne vnto his wyttynge. For yf he so sholde do he sholde be the sleer of hymself. And in
caas that he take not suche penaūce as it is sayd / that in geuynge lyf for lyf neuer may he all holy be acquyte in this worlde / as vnto the payne deyte But well ayenst god as vnto the regarde of ye gyl∣te & not for to be fynally dampned. And yf the per¦sone were slayne of suche condycyon that he sustey¦ned & nourysshed fader & moder or childern or o∣ther housholde / the moder is holden yf vnto hym it be possyble them to susteyne & mary the dough∣ters & supplye as vnto that all other charges that the persone slayn susteyned after that it is well possyble in suche cas. In this dyffyculte of restytu¦cyon appyred the lytell oyscrecyon of many con∣fessours the whiche oftymes assoylen more lygh∣tly for the deth of a man than they sholde do for the deth of an hoūde or other beest in lykewyse as declared the Scotte in the .xv. dystynccyon of his quart. And than for as moche that wt grete payne may he bere so grete charge / it is there expedyent vnto saluacyon to take the deth in gree after the ordynaūce of Justyce. Restytucyon for the mayme of ony persone ought to be done after the exces of the sayd mayme the whiche is so named / for as mo¦che as ye persone maymed leseth all holy the vsage of some or of many of his membres. Also in sucheExtra de iniurii & dāno dato. ca. . restytucyon a man ought to consydre the state of persone endāmaged / for the poore labourer the whi¦che by that hath lost his hande sholde haue more grete harme than sholde a man gretely ryche. Also yf he lye in bedde the stryker ought for to paye the Journeys of the surgyne wt these other necessytees so as sayen the ryghtes / or elles the restytucyon is
not suffycyent. ¶ Here folowith the restytucyon for these thynges temporelles. AS vnto y• restytucōn for these thynges tem¦porelles / itNon furtū facies exodi. xx.

In lyke wyse to wholde frō an other ayenst ye good & ordy∣nate wyll of hȳ to whome ye thynge apperteyned it is mortall synne. By the whiche it foloweth yt du∣rynge the wyle in suche wyse to retayne from an o∣ther there is no power in heuen nor in erthe ye whi∣che hym may assoyle / for ye cōmaūdement{is} of god may not be chaūged or varyed by dyspensacyon or other wyse / by the whiche more ouer it appyred yt it is truely sayd & of good ryght. Yelde or hange whe¦re the deth of helle shall abyde. In this mater of restytucyon ye whiche is moche necessarye ben to see & to note foure thynges by ordre. The fyrst is whi¦che is he that ought to restore The seconde is what thynge he ought to restore. The thyrde is to whom he sholde restore. The fourth is whan a man ought to restore. ¶ Here foloweth of hym ye whiche ought to restore AS vnto the fyrst is to vndstande not alone¦lyVersus. Iussi siliū sen∣sus palpo recurs'. Par icās mut{us} n obstans nō ma¦nifestans. he ye whiche hath taken frō the other a∣yenst reason & Justyce is holden to restore / but wt yt many other maner of persones as he ye whiche ga∣ue

Also yf he hath gyuen coūseyll / comfort / ayde / defence / or yf he hath hydden y• thynge taken / stolen / or rauyshed wt these malefactours / or yt he hath taken gayns or parte vnto the sayd theeft he is holden to restore. Also yf he sholde prohybyte & may defende by the auctoryte of his offyce / as these lordes & prelat{is} to the regarde of theyr subiect{is} or theyr offyeers / or he the whiche sholde be lawfully requyred to saye the trouh of the theeft  wyll not it confesse. All these condycyons of persones be named flaterers & con∣senters / & euery of theym is holden to make hole re¦stytucyon / by suche wyse yt yf they were many & o∣ne restored all holy they ben all acquyted ayenst hȳ vnto whome ye dāmage hath ben done / as in regar¦de to make restytucōn / but euery of them is boūde vnto hȳ the whiche them hath acquyted of the por¦cyon the whiche vnto hym may apperteynen. ¶ Here foloweth what thynge ought to be restored AS vnto the seconde poynt ye which is whatSi videas futem currebas cū co et cū adulteris por∣tionē tuā ponebas hec fecisti & tacui. &c. p̄s. xlix. thynge ought to be restored / it is to be vnd¦stande that yf the thynge stolen is of suche condy∣cyon that it may bere fruyte as is londe / or beest{is} / it ought to be restored with the fruytes ouer the dā¦mages & other partes that myght haue ronne vn∣to hym vnto whome the sayd thynge apperteyned An other thynge it sholde be to haue purchased he rytages or possessyons with syluer stolen / for it shall suffyse to restore the somme of moneye with
the dāmages Justely estemed that he myght haue ronne in dāmage. ¶Here foloweth to whome he ought to make re∣stytucyon.

Some hath wylled to saye yt the resty∣tucyon of suche thynges to the partye incertayne / ought to be made by the ordynaūce of prelat{is} or o∣ther Justycyers. But saynt Thomas & the Scotte sayen that it is not of necessyte but it may be done by the good dyscrecyon of hym ye whiche is boūde to restore / be it by hymself or by other. Also it is to be noted that yf ony stele from a theef the thynge that he hath stolen a man it sholde restore vnto hȳ vnto whome it apperteyned of ryght or ye whiche it wtholdeth vnder ye forme of preste or of gage. Here foloweth whā a mā ought to make restytuōn
AS vnto the fourth the whiche is to kno∣we whan a man is holden to restore / it is to vnderstande that it is not lawfull to reteyne frō an other houre ne moment whan he vnto whome he ought to make restytucyon wolde Justely that yt sayd restytucyon vnto hym be made / & allo y• the withholder hath place / tyme & space / and puyssaū¦ce that to do / for it shall be well lawfull for some circūstaunces to dyfferre to make restytucyon / as whan he vnto whome it ought to be made wolde or sholde wyll after good reason that it be dyffer∣red / or for as moche that it sholde be vnto the grete preiudyce of the comen wele. As for example. He the whiche sholde be in the warre & in the seruyce of the kynge the whiche hath dystressed ony law∣full marchaunde of the sōme of an hondred crow∣nes the whiche may not be restored without sellyn¦ge hors & harneys of armes / by the whiche it shall be vnprouffytable vnto the welthe of the comon people / and that restytucyon may be occasyon of ryght grete ylle in all the royalme. For by the de∣faute of one nayle a man leseth a shoe / by a shoe an horse / by an horse a man / by a man a bataylle / by a bataylle a royalme. By the whiche it appy∣reth that the marchaunde sholde more loue that restytucyon were dyfferred for the greate comon welth than his owne wyll were accomplysshed for his lytell welth partyculer. And therfore in suche caas and other semblable he may well dyfferre re∣stytucyon with purpose to restore in place and in tyme. Also restytucyon may somtyme be vnto the grete peryll and dāmage of hym vnto whome it
is done / as the glayne to a man at the houre that by fury he wolde kylle an other. Also some may be of suche condycyon that yf he restored vpon ye hou∣re he sholde renne in grete shame or in grete dāma¦ge / & he vnto whome he sholde make restytucyon nothyng or lytel of profyte sholde haue. By ye whi¦che it appyred yt after charyte & reason he ought to attende place / tyme / & oportunyte in that that resty¦tucyon vnto hym be made after good charyte & rea¦son in lyke wyse as it apperteyned. By these thyn¦ges beforsayd appyred ynough yt yf the thynge wt∣holden hath ben taken secretly it ought to be yelde secretly / & as vnto hym ye whiche hath no power to restore vnto hym it suffysed vnto saluacyon to ha∣ue dyspleasure of the caas with purpose to yelde as many tymes & often as he shall haue oportunyte as it is sayd / & he may reteyne his necessyte corpo∣rell / as of drynke & of meete & of cloth not to lyue delycyously / or to holde grete estate & haboūdaūce of an other mannes goodes. If ony were in extre∣me necessyte / by the whiche he sholde take ony thyn¦ge fruytefully for to ayde hym in suche necessyte / he shall not be holden to yelde it / notwtstandynge that afterwarde he hath well the power / but yf he hath taken before suche necessyte in the whiche he falleth afterwarde durynge the tyme of that ne∣cessyte he shall not be holden to restore / but after∣warde yf he haue power than he shall be boūde to restore. If a woman maryed conceyue of an other than of her husbonde y• caas is stronge to remedye & of yt may come grete ylle & dāmage / as well vnto the husbonde as to ye very enherytours / by ye which
it foloweth that the woman may not recouer salua¦cyon yf she make not restytucyon. But of y• maner many grete theologyens & lawyers it determen dy¦uersely. The Scotte is of the opynyon that suche woman is not holden to declare herself neyther vn¦to her childe but it ought to shewe dyscretly / be it sone or doughter for to put hym in the estate of the chirche / and to leue the herytage vnto other / or yf she may not vnto that come and that she be ry∣che of meouables and of herytages she ought with out her to declare b testament or other wyse to re∣compense as moche the husbonde the whiche hath had the charge of the auoutrye as also the enhery∣tours after as she may goodly. Raymonde sayth that yf it were very semblable that suche infante fered and loued god and were persuasyble the mo∣der myght make suche processe / that is to vnder∣stande that before her confessour / the moder & the childe now hauynge age & dyscrecyon them shol∣de present / & that that the confessour make the chil¦de to swere that he shall holde secrete the thynge that he vnto hym wyll declare vnto the prouffyte of his soule. Also to make the moder to swere that she shall saye without ony malyce the trouth. And than these thyng{is} done y• sayd mod may well swe∣re yf she be well certayne yt the sayd infante is not of her husbonde / ye whiche thynge alwayes y• sayd infant is not boūde to byleue in suche maner yt by that he is boūde to forsake his herytage. But yf he it byleue & he it forsake he dooth well and me∣rytoryously. Other hath wylled to saye that yf the woman & the husbonde were of suche condycyons
that she were also as gouernouresse & that vnto hȳ were very semblable yt she hym sholde pacyfye than for the surete of conscyence she it myght declare & manyfeste / & more ouer to remedye y• caas for the best yt it sholde be possyble. By these thynges befo∣re sayd appyred as to gyue true & sure remedye in that caas it is a thynge ryght harde consyderynge the varyacōns of ye circūstaunces & the dyuerse con¦dycyons of the persones. Appyred also ye horrybyly te of ye synne of the brekynge of maryage & ye grete theeft & dampnacōn of manyybaudes men & wo¦men. If ony lette & draweth backe an other to en∣tre in to good relygyon approued wtout Juste cau∣se & resonable he synned mortally. If he do ony vy∣olence to the persone late entred in to religyon ouer the mortall synne he is excōmunycate & so is boūde to enduce that persone that he hath withdrawen & myscoūseylled / or other to entre in the sayd rely¦gyon and in caas that he may not make suche in∣duccyon / he there sholde entre hymself / yf he haue not lettynge suffycyent lawfull / for elles he ma∣keth not restytucyon suffycyent vnto relygyon. If he haue letted ony to come vnto benefyce of the chirche vnto maryage / vnto the purchase of hery∣tage / or of other thynge / & he that do pryncypally for to anoye hym / or pryncypally for his synguler prouffyte & wt yt in awaytynge to anoye an other / by suche condycōn yt he hath not done ye sayd lettyn¦ge but for to anoye an other he is boūde to restore after the arbytracyon of people of reason and of good conscyence. But yf he haue letted an other not by intencyon and wyll to anoye hym / but for
the prouffyte of hym / or of his / he is not in nothȳ¦ge holden to restore / for euery man may procure his prouffyte by wayes and meanes lawfull and ho∣neste / notwithstondynge by the occasyon of that cometh some lettynge in dāmage vnto his neygh / bour / yf he hath stolen a lytell hogge of ony lytell valour from the houre that he hym taketh and af∣terwarde hym nouryssheth tyll vnto the valoure of ony grete somme he is not holden in dede of con∣scyence for to restore but onely vnto the valour of the beste at the tyme that he hym toke / And alyke thynge it sholde be of a colte / or other beestes / or to haue helyd or nourysshed or elles to better the thyn¦ge stolen / or rauysshed / and by the thynge contrary yf the thynge stolen be impeyred / he ought it to re¦payre and so is holden of the dāmages the whiche may be comen vnto hym vnto whome aperteyneth the thynge stolen / for by cause of the sayd theft. /  Also yf suche thynge stolen perysshe by fortune or ellys yf it abyde alwayes he the whiche hath stolen is bounde yf he hath not done his deuoyre to offre restytucyon before that the thynge perysshe. The whiche restytucyon he that is endāmaged hath not wyll it to receyue / yf he hath boughte wyttyngly the thynge stolen / or rauysshed the whiche other wy¦se aperteyneth not vnto the seller / and hath inten¦cyon to bye it and retayne / for hym selfe / ouer the mortall synne he is holden it to restore vnto hym vnto whome apertayneth the thynge so bought / or vnto the inherytours / or vnto the poore as it hath ben sayd before without power to repute the pryse that he hath gyuen / but onely vnto hym the which
hym hath made suche sale. Also more ouer he is holden to kepe harmeles and warande hym vnto whome appertayneth the thynge stolen where soo euer that he become / but yf he it boughte in good intencyon / that is to knowe for to yelde it / and vn¦to that / that it were not all loste / he there may Just¦ly repute the somme gyuen or yelde alonely the sur¦plus that it may be worth / and yf he can not fyn¦de hym vnto whome suche thynge appertyneth / yt sōme of the surplus ought to be gyuen vnto the po∣re. but yf he hath bought thynge the whiche hath ben stolen / the whiche he byleueth to be of loyalte he is not holden it to restore tyll vnto that / that he be certefyed of the trouth / but after that he is duely certefyed / than he is holden it to restore / and that durynge the tyme that he byleueth that the thynge was of loyalte it peryssheth or were consumed in parte or in all / he is bounde to restore alonely the party with the fruytes that he hath in tyme that he byleued that the thynge was solde truely Also they that eten and drynken of the rauen of the thefte bē¦holden to restore vnto the estymacyon that they ha¦ue taken / excepte those the whiche ben in grete ne∣cessyte / and vnto whome it may be very semblable that it shall please well those vnto whome ye sayd thynge rauysshed or stolen appertayneth / as it shol¦de be prechers / or other the whiche entende to endu¦ce these theuys to amendement & vnto restytucyon also the wyse y• chyldren / & the seruaūtes of those the whiche haue all theyr goodes of thefte / as is that of vsury / of symony / or of rauen ben holdē to restore after the valour y• that they may haue of the
sayd thefte be it in drynke / meete / to hose / to cloth / or otherwyse / but onely in as moche as they haue laboured and take payne by ammonycion or other wyse that restytucyon were made vnto the partye Also yf with the goodes the whiche were euyll go¦ten / there hath some the whiche were truely goten / they may adresse theyr intencyon to lyue of those goodes / and not of the thefte / or they may lyue wt theyr laboure / or they sholde demaūde prouysyon of Justyce / & yf they may not lyue by ony of the wayes before sayd they sholde more sooner demaū¦de almes than to lyue of thefte / but alonely in the case of extreme necessyte.

OVer these thynges before sayd in the .viii. cō¦maundement the synner ought to take hede vnto these poyntes that folowen. The fyrste is of the synner lyenge. The seconde is of detraccyon. The thyrde is of adulacyon. The fourth is of pariurynge / As vto the fyrste it is to vnderstonde that there ben thre maner of lyenges as to speke ge¦nerally.Mēdaciū triplex est {per}nisiosū ocosū offici. sum. The fyrste is yt the whiche beryth noysaū¦ce vnto ony personel / and is alwayes mortall sȳne whan a man doth it wyttyngly for suche an entēte and is cōmytte in thre maners / of the whiche the fyrste is yll / The seconde is wors / The thyrde is worste of all. The fyrste is the lye by the whiche a man doth noysaūce vnto one / and doth prouffyte vnto another / The seconde is that by the whiche a man doth noysaunce vnto another without prouf¦fytynge another. The thyrde maner is that y• whi¦che is contrary vnto the holy fayth catholyque / as ben herytykes the whiche sowen errours and fals doctrynes somtyme for to come vnto theyr leche∣ryes / as those the whiche affermynge that symple fornycacyon is not mortall synne / or that the synne of lechery is not so grete / or so greuous In lyke wy¦se as sayth these holyscryptures / & these prechers / the whiche it cōdampnen / somtyme suche is com∣mytte by suche lyenge couetyse / As ben those the whiche prechen vnto ye sȳple people as for to gyue
some syluer / or other thynge temporall in takyng theyr indulgencis they purchasen theyr absolucōn a pena et aculpa in hydynge from them the trou∣the / and geuynge them to vnderstonde that by the vertue of the indulgence he is pardonned a pena & aculpa the whiche thynge is false / for the vertue of these indulgences may not be vnderstonde / but vnto the payne temporall / of those the whiche ben in the estate of grace and by the cōsequent without the gylte of mortall synne / and of suche prechers there ben at this daye without nombre thorowout crystyente / after as the gloryous saynt Petyr hath lately prenounced. The seconde maner of lyenge is that the whiche is done by dysporte / and is com∣mytte in two maners. The fyrste by dysordynate pleasure that a man taketh in tryfylles & talkyn∣ges. The seconde by a desyred dysordynate / and to please the herers rehersynge fables / or dysportes & in these two maners may he haue mortall synne / or venyall / after the cyrcumstaunces of the dysor∣denaunce and of the mater of whiche a man spe∣keth / or of the persones of the whiche a man spe∣keth / or vnto whome suche lyes ben tolde. The thyrde maner of lyenges is that by the whiche a man prouffyteth vnto ony persone in sauynge him his goodes temporall / as golde syluer or other thyn¦ge / or to chastyse his body / or his lyfe corporall. and it is to be noted yt for asmoche as to lye it is to saye some thȳge / & to byleue / or vnderstonde yt it is not so as a man sayth & affermeth / it is impossyble to lye wyttȳgly in ony maner wtout mortall synne or
venyall / the whiche thynge he sholde not do for to saue all those yt ben lyuynge. A man may some tyme hyde the trouth / but not to lye without grete synne / to saye false for dysportynge or for to prouf¦fyte vnto ony persone without noysaūce vnto ano∣ther it may be venyall synne in lay people and se∣culers. But with grete payne is lyenge in people of perfeccyon wtout mortall synne / as sayth Bona¦uenture & frācoys de marōnes vpon ye thyrde of y• sentences / of the whiche the reason is asmoche for sclandre of theyr neghbours / as for the perfeccyon of the estate of relegyon / by the whiche ryght desy¦rously euery relegyous ought to kepe hym from the tellynge of lesynges / yf it vnto hym be very sembla¦ble yt in so doynge he gyueth euyll example / & ma¦ter of sclandre / specyally vnto people feble and sel∣lers the whiche lyghtly maken of a lytell occasyon theyr euyll prouffyte / another thynge it is to go a backe with ony fable. The whiche as well in the intencyon of the saynge as in the maner / and vnto the purpose to speke it semeth well to be rehercyd for a fable / for in suche maner of lyenge is not pro¦prely to lye / for as to lye it is to speke agayne hys conscyence in gyuynge falsely to vnderstonde vnto the herers / and in the recytacyon of suthe fables where the speker wylleth for suche to be vnderston¦de it is not mortall synne after aynt Thomas / . mayster Alexandre and the Scot. Also in anotherIn quolibetis. place sayth saynt Thomas that a man may lye mortally / as well by wrytynge by abylemens by to¦kenes and by operacyon. as a man doth in wordes
For a man that is dōme may well synne mortally in his maner to lye / Also lyenge is pryncypally in speche / In lyke wyse symulacyon and fyccyon ben in operacyons / Ypocresye is one maner of symula¦cyonSimulata sātitas duplex ē ītquitas hie. & an. sup ip̄m.

For the holy scrypture reherseth of the holy patryarche Abraham that he counseylled his wyfe that she sholde saye vnto the Egypcyens that she was his syster / and in that doynge there was trouth hydde and trouth wrapped / for as mo∣che as she was his wyfe ryally / and his syster in na¦ture humayne / or also for as moche as aūcyently those of one selfe lygne as were Abraham and his wyfe callyd eche other brothers and systers / and in lyke maner to saye is founde in many other places of holy scryptures. Also a man fyndeth another maner of lyenge ye whiche may be called iactance &
is commytted in spekynge or ymagenynge of hym¦selfe more grete thynges than there is of goodnes of nobles / of prowesse / or of vertues and after the greuousnes of the circūstaunces / it is oftyme mor∣tall synne. Also to saye of hymselfe ony thynge of his feblesses and necessytes / or of his synnes / or to take vestemens of ab eccyon to ye ende that a man be renommed and reputed humble abiecte & grete thynge in merytes and deuocyons before god / the whiche thynge is not suche as a man it sheweth / yt may be mortall synne / and suche synne is named yronie / not that the whiche is of grāmare / by the whiche a man sayth one and gyueth to vnderston∣de the contrary / for the maner and for the purpose in the whiche a man speketh the wordes / as to saye alas that thou arte a good man / or thynge sembla¦ble / ye whiche is asmoche to saye that he is nothȳge worth / and there he may haue synne / yf suche thȳ∣geQui offenderit i vno fact{us} est oīm re{us}. ia. ii. be sayd malycyously / & for to de fame / another it sholde be yf for to repreue / or for to teche a man vsech in suche maner to speke / a man may more ouer doubte of a preest / or of another persone the whiche is in the estate of grace / and sayth his con∣fyteor in aduouynge that he is a synner / in dede in worde and in thought / and in all maner of synnes to knowe yf he saye trouth or lye / and yf he oughte so to assent / or otherwyse / The answere the preste speketh in the persone of all them that ben cryste∣nyd / in whome be it in one / or in another ben all maner of synnes / Also sayth saynt Austen / that in one only synne a man may truely consyder many synnes / For he that synneth mortally is a man kyl
ler / For asmoche as he putteth his soule the which is the doughter of god with all the blyssed trynyte by creacyon vnto deth spyrytuall. Also he cōmyt∣teth thefte or sacrylege for as moche that he taketh as well from god / as from the holy chirche ye thyn¦ge the whiche vnto them appertayneth agayne ye wyll of the souerayne lorde / That is to vnderston¦de hym selfe and the honoure and obedyence that he oweth vnto god. Also he cōmytteth baudrye & auorye for as moche as he gyueth and subdueth the soule / the whiche by the vetue of the passyon / and of holy baptem was the spouse of Jhesu crist vnto the rybaudrye and auowtry of soules. That is to vnderstonde of the ennemy of humayne lyg∣nage. Also he lyeth and breketh the fayth promy∣sed vnto baptesme and is apostate of the holy ca∣tholyque / & also of other synnes by suche maners spyrytually to vnderstonde that who so cōmytteth one mortall synne / he hym may knowe in all with out lye / after these thynges before sayd is to be no / ted that euery true crysten man ought to be veryta∣ble as well before god as before man. And also in his owne conscyence / in dedes / in wdes / and in abyllementes / and in his countenaūces / In lyke wyse as in all these thynges he may cōmytte lyen∣ge / fyccyon / and duplycyte / of the whiche thynges yf they ben come a man ought him to repente pur∣ge / & confesse / Also yf he hath ben called for to bere wytnes before a Justyce & he wyll not saye y• trouth the whiche vnto hym was demaunded / or to lye to his wyttynge vnto the dāmage of another / and in doynge irreuerence vnto the Justyce / ouer ye mortal

OVer these thynges spoken in the .ix. cōmaan¦dement the synner ought to take hede vntoCaplm. xxiii the poyntes the whiche folowen. That is o kno¦we yf he hath desyred by consentynge and delybe∣racyon to accomplysshe the synne of lechery / or yf he haue delyted in carnall thoughtes / and for to vn¦derstonde and well to Juge of suche wylles whan it is mortall synne / or alonely venyall / The why∣che thynge is ryght harde / it behoueth fyrste to vn∣derstonde thre thynges the whiche ben in vs deffe∣rences / The fyrst is sensualyte the whiche is none other thynge but the .v. wyttes of nature with theyr operacyons / as is the syght / the taste / the herynge / the smellynge / and the touchynge / In these fyue thynges we and these bestes ben comen / The secō∣de thynge the whiche is in vs / is the lawe porcyon of reason the whiche is a lyght of knowledge of our operacyons and dyscrecyon naturall of thynges sensybles in the whiche we surmoūt these bestes. /: The thyrde thynge is the souerayn porcyon of rea¦son the whiche is a lyght by y• whiche we haue dys¦posycyon to vnderstonde these thynges spyrytuall▪ dyuyne / and eternall / the whiche porcyon may be anormed of the noble vertu of the fayth catholyque and enformed of the trouth of the cōmaundemen∣tes of god / and than she may and ought to haue do mynacyon and rule as well the sensualyte / as the lawe porcyon of reason and all theyr operacyons / or yf there be defaute / or neclygence of the deuyll of hell allyed of the sensualyte / and of the monda∣nyte of this present lyfe putteth in oftymes the con¦cupyscence carnall and temporall by ye wyndowes
of the soules the whiche en the fyue wyttes of na∣ture before sayd / to the ende that the lawe porcyon of reason there taketh pleasure dysordenate / be it in drynke or meete / or melodye of soūdys / or in tow∣chynges / or other pleasures sensualles / and that she induceth the hyghe porcyan to gyue consente in su¦che pleasure dysordenate is dyspleasaūce vnto god after the forme that tho dayes / Eue presented vn to Adam the beaute of the apple / and the swetnes of the taste / vnto the whiche thynge he condysten∣dyd and consented agayne the cōmaundement of god by the whiche all humayne lygnage was dam¦ned / yf god by his mercy infynyte hadde not reme¦dyed. By Eue a man sholde vnderstonde as well the sensualyte / as the lawe frayle porcyon of rea∣son / and by Adam the souerayne porcyon & this is the foundacyon to vnderstonde whan these sȳnes y• whiche be cōmytted alonely in the wyll ben mortal or venyall for in the oonly pleasure of the sensua∣lyte / he may not haue mortall synne / But yf the pleasure of the thynge deffended / as is lechery thef¦te or propre vengeaūce cometh tyll vnto the lawe porcyon of reason and in that doynge aresteth and abydeth in hym there in delytynge before that so∣uerayne reason may or ought to haue suffycyente aduertyssement / it is venyall synne comenly / But yf souerayne reason is notally neclygente to repre∣ue and agayn saye suche pleasure dysordenate / by the whiche neclygence and defaute / the reason in∣warde abydeth and delyteth in y• sayd dysordenaū∣te / how be it that the accomplysshynge of the dede
hym dyspleaseth / and it agayne sayth / than is that mortall synne after the comen sentēce of doctours for hye porcyon of reason is in blame / for as mo∣che as she hath not ben inough dylygent to repre∣ue and to put out the peryllous pleasure the whiche was comen into the inwarde reason / & suche nec¦lygence may be named consentyngly by interpre∣tacyon / Bonauenture sayth in this mater that many suche thoughtes to be alonely venyall synne The whiche hath ben well Juged they ben mor∣tall synnes / wherfore in suche doubte a man hym ought delygently to examen and hym to confesse / as of mortall synne. for in all cases of conscyence / the whiche ben doubtous / a man is bounde to chese the moost sure partye. Also it is to be noted that oonly wyll fully determyned and dysposed to accō¦plysshe ony mortall synne / is mortall synne / & of suche condycyon / as hadde be the the synne / yf that it hadde ben accomplysshed by werke. As for an example / yf ony hadde wyll to haue company car∣nall of a vyrgyn he cōmytteth the synne of defflo / racyon / yf with ony of his kynred / it is inceste / yf with ony relegyous / it is sacrylege / and so vnto the synne of thefte and of other commaundementes But in that vnto suche dyfference that the synne the whiche abydeth alonely in the wyll is not pu∣nysshed / of the payne canon / or Cyuyle as sholde be the wyll with the dede / An example oonly wyl to bete a clerke / or to slee hym agayne the ordre of charyte suffyceth not for to renne in the sentence of excomunycacyon / or for to be reserued vnto ye pope
or vnto the bysshop / and therfore a symple curate hym may assoyle / and so of other case. Also it is to be notyd that yf ony persone hath wyll to accom∣plysshe mortall synne / suche wyll may be interrept and deuysed in many maners. Fyrste by wyll con¦traryous as is true contrycion and dyspleaser to haue hadde suche wyll / and after suche contrycion of newe retorneth vnto that cursyd wyll of synne. And than they ben two mortall synnes / in asmo∣che that suche wyll drowe backe in the maner spo∣ken. Secondly she may be interrupte by dyuerse thoughtes / and occupacyons woldly / as for to sle∣pe / to drynke / or to ete / or for to speke with other per¦sones / by suche wyse that as many tymes & often the temptacyon retorneth vnto the mynde the wyll is dysposed to accomplysshe the synne / and than af¦ter some doctours / they ben as many of mortall sȳ¦nes / as the sayd wyll hath ben interrupted oftymes Other wyll saye that it is but one mortall synne / of as moche the more greuous / as it hath ben by lō¦ge tyme contynued / and therfore the longe abydȳ¦ge / and frequentacyon / of suche temptacyon ought to be confessed / and dysclosed after that it is possy∣ble / vnto the fraylte of the mynde humayne / by su¦che maner that the confessour dyscrete may vnder∣stonde the multytude / or the greuousnes of suche synne / for ellys the confessyon sholde not be suffy∣cyent / for that that a man is bounde to tell all his synnes as vnto the nombre. Also yf suche cursyd wyll were applyed agayne many persones / agayn one / & after vnto another / they sholde be as many synnes mortalles as they sholde be of persones but
yf suche wyll be applyed vnto many persones by one oonely operacyon that sholde not be but one synne as to the operacyon of the wyll / but it shold be many as vnto oblygacyon of payne and vnto ye deformyte of synne / as for example. Some harlot seeth .vi. wymen / of the whiche the one is in wydo hode / the other in maryage / the other a vyrgyn / & so in other dyuers degrees / and that he hath hadde a wyll and consentynge to desyre to haue theyr cō∣pany carnall / vnto the regarde of one that sholde be auowtry / and vnto the other defloracōn and so of other dyuers degrees / And a man ought to vn∣derstonde these thynges spoken of cursyd wyll / as well of the concupyscence carnall defended in the ix. cōmaundementes as of the concupyscence of co∣uetyse defended in the .x. ¶ Here foloweth of the .x. cōmaundement.

Also more ouer it is to be noted that he the whiche endā∣mageth his neyghboure in a lytell thynge be it in byenge or in sellynge / or ellys he hym wolde endā∣mage gladly of a more gretter thȳge yf he myght

And therfore those ye which ben present at suche departyng sholde praye with the company of holy creatures the whiche ben presented for the poore creature the whiche is in the moost grete ne∣cessyte & dystresse yt euer vnto hȳ ▪may come in this worlde / and hym they sholden recomforte & enduce vnto hope in she wynge hym y• token of y• ryghtt py¦teous passyon of our blyssed sauyoure & redēptour Jhesu cryste / the whiche is the confusyon of deuyl∣les of helle in namynge hym / or make to speke the name of Jhesus / for thā it is no tyme to brynge vn¦to theyr mynde dettes restytucyons / or the grete ha¦tes and synnes / for that ought to haue be made be∣fore yt they were comē vnto suche extremyte of pay¦nes & of dyseases y• whiche than them holden in al partes.

Of the whiche punycyon it behoueth to see fyrste in generall and afterwarde more in espe¦cyall.

I shall re¦here ten paynes pryncypalles of the partye of the body and ten other of the partye of the soule. And euery of the twenty paynes is dyuysed in foure / & so there shall be foure and twenty paynes partycu¦lers taken of ye paynes infynyte and without nom∣bre that suffren and shall suffre euer without ende (these cursyd

THe fyrste is fyre ryght cruelly brēnynge. The seconde is colde soo moche fresynge. The thyrde grete cryes of dolour wtout ceassynge The fourth smoke the whiche may not in helle be lefte. The fyfth odoure and stynkynge moche horryble The syxte vysyon of deuylles terryble. The seuenth hungre tormentynge cruelly. The .viii. thruste y• which tormenteth in lyke wyse The .ix. grete shame and confusyon. The tenth in all his membres afflyccyon. THe fyrste payne is of fyre brennynge of the whiche it is to vnderstonde yt notwithston∣dynge yt the fyre of helle is a thynge corporall & of ye same nature as is yt of this world / how be it they dyfferen in foure thynges. The fyrste is in sharpe¦nes of hete / for it is more hote than is oures / of as moche as oures is more hoter than yt the whiche is paynted on a wall after as sayth saynt Austen the
whiche is none other thynge to vnderstonde but y• we be not suffycyent for to ymagen the excesse of ye fyre of helle in regarde and comparyson of oures. Of the whiche euer more we haue so meruaylous experyens that there is no metall / ne other thynge but that it melteth / brenneth / or altreth / and ther∣fore esmeruayll ye torment of the fyre of hell what it may be. The seconde dyfference of the fyre of helle / and of oures / is as vnto the hardenes for ou∣res is in beynge lesseth and consumeth his mater / but that of hell is eternall / and neuer lesseth / For for euer her mater shall endure▪ That is to vnder∣stonde the body and ye soule of dampned synners them holden alwayes in one maner. Thyrdly they dyfferen in lyght / for how be it that / that of helle is grete and brennynge euer more / y et it yeldeth no lyght the whiche is ony thynge plea saunt / but all the syght and lyght the whiche is in helle / it is for to torment greuously those yt ben dāpned. Fourth¦ly they dyfferen / for it conserueth in beynge ye thȳ∣ge that it brenneth and boyleth to chaunge in to as¦shes / or in to other nature. By these foure thynges appereth that none vnderstondynge is suffycyent to comprehende the horrybylyte of suche tormente. THe seconde payne is of water colde / & dyf∣fereth from that of this present worlde in foure thynges. The fyrste is oppresse of colde / for lyke wyse as the brennynge of the fyre of helle sur¦mounteth the brennynge of oures / euen so the col¦de in the other worlde surmounteth the colde in
this worlde by suche maner that yf the moost gre¦teste moūtayne of the worlde were of yren massyf and embrased as was euer stele for to forge / and it were put in the tormente of the ponde of yse in the coldenes of hell / it sholde be from parte to parte yse. also as in a moment. And therfore sayth well saynt Gregorye that suche colde is intollerable / & yf a man demaunde wherfore oure lorde sayth not as well in the gospell / departe you from me acur∣sed dampned and go ye in to the colde eternall as he sayth into the fyre eternall. The answere / for asomoche as the fyre amonge other elementes is y• moost actyf and the moost afflyctyf / therfore god vnto vs gyueth example of fyre more sooner than of the yse. I put that he it gyueth ynough to vnder¦stonde by other places of y• gospell / where he sayth that these dampned shall wepe and shall grynde theyr teeth for coldenes. The seconde dyfferēce of ye water of helle & of this worlde is for y• of hell ne¦uer chauffeth for ony thynge hote y• whiche vnto it may be gyuen / but euer more abydeth in one estate and degree of coldenes. The thyrde dyfference is that / yt of helle is euermore trouble full of stenche and incomparable erroure: The fourth dyfference is for that helle maketh not these dampned to dye but in lyke wyse as these fysshes lyuen in the wa∣ter in this worlde / so these dampned may not dye in the water in that worlde. THe thyrde payne is to crye & to braye in we¦pynge and in playnynge ye whiche torment
is the cause for foure thynges. Therfore as moche that the dampned knowen that they shall neuer se god / the whiche is the moost gretest payne of helle for these saued / or these dampned loue better to be in helle for euer / and to see god than to be in para¦dyse & see hym not yf suche thynge were possyble And in suche wyse yt none ne may speke nor thyn¦ke the melodye the whiche is made in paradyse as well of the blyssed angelles as of holy men and wo¦men yblyssed. In lyke wyse there is none that may declare the pyteous and horryble trye and howlyn¦ge the whiche is made in helle as well of deuylles / as of other dampned / And yf a man demaunde what they saye in cryenge. The answere. All the dampned cursen the creature. Also they curse togy¦ders / as theyr fader and moder / and the houre that they were begoten / that they were borne / and that they were put vnto nourysshynge / and those y• them sholde correcte and teche / and also those that haue ben the occasyon of theyr synnes / as the baude cur¦syd be the baude / and also of other occasyons in dy¦uers synnes. The seconde cause of the crye of them dampned is for the consyderacyon that they haue of the tyme of mercye the whiche is paste. In ye whi¦che they may do penaunce and purchase paradyse / The thyrde cause is of theyr crye for by cause of y• horryble paynes that they enduren. As we may cō¦sydere that yf an hundreth persones hadde euery of them one fote and one hande in the fyre or in the water sethynge without power to dye / what bruyt and what crye they sholde make / but that sholde be lesse than nothynge in comparyson of deuylles
and of other dampned / for they ben more than an hundreth thousande thousandes the whiche all-to∣gyders vnto them doeth noysaūce / and all in one thondre cryenge and brayen horrybly. The fourth reason of suche clamoure is for as moche that they bē dyspeyred for euer to haue remedy. A man may demaunde how that may be as after the Justyce dyuyne that for one oonly synne the whiche hath be so sone done and so lyghtly cōmytte a. soule the whiche hath ben of god so moche beloued the whi¦che vnto the ymage of hymself hath be made and fermed is dampned eternally vnto so grete depnes and confusyon of paynes and tormentes. The an¦swere may be made by the example of a byeng of an herytage the whiche is done in a lytell tyme & how be it he gyueth the ryght of possessyon in per¦petuyte. In lyke wyse the synner selleth his soule and the ryght that he hath vnto ye royalme of pa∣radyse in lytell whyle. By the whiche he is dysen∣heryte for euer / and vnto eternyte of paynes con∣dampned. Also a stroke is sone stryken wherof ye deth foloweth without euer to recouer the lyfe. Al∣so a man is anone fallen in to suche a dytche soo yt the arysynge is impossyble. The answere by rea∣sons the synners the whiche in theyr ende haue be foūde in synne mortall haue synne in eternyte for yf they hadde lyued in this worlde euer more hadde they contynued theyr sȳne. By the whiche of good ryghte they sholde haue payne without ende. Also after the deth the soule and the wyll ben innuua∣bles be it in good or in yll. And for as moche that the cursyd wyll of those that be dampned dureth &
perseuereth in her iniquyte she ought for euer more to abyde in paynes also the synne in the whiche ye dampned ben deed / is agayne the god of eternyte / By the whiche after Justyce eternall and infynyte the payne ought to be without ende. Also for a ly∣tell tyme of true penaunce / or of a good werke do∣ne in the estate of grace / god gyueth in eternyte y• royalme of paradyse / by the whiche Justyce it re∣quyreth that in lyke wyse / also for one oonly synne mortall of the whiche a man myght in lycell ty∣me do penaunce is gyuen payne eternall and of yt eternyte of paynes shall be spokē after more plaȳ¦ly. THe fourth payne is smoke.

THe fyfth payne is odour stynkynge and hor¦ryble cause of foure partes. The fyrste par¦tye shall be for as moche yt all the stynkynge thyn∣ges that euer were or euer shall be. Than shall be assembled and caste in to the dytche of helle. And a body humayne the whiche rotteth in a waye / or in a quarefoure of a towne without beynge buryed is so grete stynche specyally in the tyme of grete he¦te that suche stynche rotteth and enpoysoneth all ye enhabytances of a cyte. What may that be of the multytude of the bodyes of all the dampned / leche¦rous people ydolatres / and other without nombre the whiche shall be wors than roten in the fyre and in the smoke the whiche may not out of hell auoy¦de thynke who so can. The seconde payne shall be of sulfre embrased after as sayth holy scrypture. / The thyrde shall be of the flesshe humayne as it is sayd the whiche after the dyuersyte and greuous¦nes of synnes shall be stynkyng more or lesse / the fourth shall procede of the presence of deuylles of the stenche of whome god hath shewed many ex∣amples as it apereth in the legende of saynt Mar¦tyn y• whan they appered in this worlde they lefte astynche intollerable. THe syxte payne is of the vysyon of deuyllesvidētes turbabū more horribili & miserabuntur &c. Cap. v. the whiche causen vnto the dampned four maner of paynes. The fyrste is fere and tremblȳ∣ge / for yf a man fere moche to see / or to mete a dog¦ge / or a lyon enraged / or other creature foule / cruel and gastly / what may that be to see contynually all the deuylles / for a man fyndeth in wrytynge yt
yf ony persone mortall see one oonly in that fygu∣re that these dampned thē seen it sholde suffyce for to make hym dye / or for to be madde and to lese al his vnderstondynge. The seconde payne the which gyueth suche vysyon vnto the dampned is conty∣nuall reproche of synnes that they them haue ma∣de to acompte. The thyrde shall be flagellacyons and tormentes inexplycables it without ende or wt out releasynge. The fourth shall be that they shal foyle and threste all the dampned togyders and in more greter dystresse thā euer were stones in a wall or in other thynge by forceof engyne of pressures.

The seconde / for thynge the whiche is in helle hath not dysposycyon for to be satyfyed The thyrde for the remembraunce that they haue of the delyte that they were wonte to take for to ete The fourth for as moche that they knowe suche hongre shall neuer cease and soo they knowe well that these tormentes before sayd and those the whi¦che folowen ben come in nature humayne.

The fyrste for as moche that the dampned haue water presented of the whiche they may not taste.

The seconde by cause of the place the whiche is ryght vyle and ryght stynkyn∣ge. The thyrde for they shall be in seruytude of the ryght yll sauoure that is of ye deuylles and vn∣to the synnes the whiche they haue loued. The fourth for the companye / for euery of the damp∣ned hath partyculer payne for the presence & damp¦nacyon of the other / as well of deuylles as of the men and women. THe tenth payne of those that ben dampned is as vnto the touchynge / for all the partyes of the body of them dampned ben more tender as to be hurted and dyseased than they were in this worlde whan by botches and apostumes they were halfe oten and that notwithstondynge they shall haue agreuaunce of foure partyes. The fyrste shall be of the ponderosyte and collygacyon from the one membre vnto the other the whiche is of as moche grete greuaunce / as the helth and the good dysposycyon was the comforte and ayde of other membres in the present lyfe and more grete of as moche as the lyfe where ye estate to come excedeth in good or in yll that of this presēt lyfe. The ayde that the one membre doeth vnto the other may be knowen in consyderynge the operacyon and vsage
of euery membre in regarde of the other / as we see that the operacyon of the mouth is the cause of ye lyfe of all the other / soo of the eyes / soo of the fote / and of euery of the other membres secrete in asmo¦che that the sykenes and dystruccyon of the one is the dystruccyon of the other / And soo in lyke wyse may a man saye of the dolour the whiche is in eue¦ry membre of the dampned / for it is suffycyent vnto the deth of all these other yf deth corporall myght be in helle recouered / and so this may be vnderston¦de not aloonly of the membres of the body of na∣ture. but with that of the membres of the body mys¦tycall / that is to saye that yf ony• were in hell with out hauynge other payne than that / that he seeth and knoweth in his neyghbours he sholde suffre for to dye of as many dethes as there are of persones dampned in suche wyse that as many of membresAsserunt theologi  te  diciū ge  ab gner h torri itū t īstrumentū u. s oe. ergo a ▪ vel aforcior  diciū or r.

The seconde payne is for the touchynge of the place in the whiche they ben the whiche fyre enbraseth not aloonly by nature / but more ouer by operacyon dyuyne for that / that he is the instrument to excersyce the Iustyce of god. /: And for as moche that these operacyons dyuynes / & maryculousses ben moche more excellentes than those the whiche ben done symply after the cours of nature the embrasynge and the tormente of the fyre of helle excedeth the hete of all metalles mol∣ten the whiche may be ymagyned more excessyuely than herte may thynke. And therfore whan suche fyre is in the depnes of the herte / of bones / of syne∣wes / and of vaynes / of bloode and of

The thyrde payne is for the touchynge of other bodyes dampned and embrased as a man seeth sensybly that of as moche that there is moch wode in a fyre / of as moche it brenneth ye more strō¦gely / and therfore the fyre embrased in a towne isPoēs eos vt cliba nū ignis ī tp̄e vul∣tus tui. s. x. ryght peryllous for the multytude of the houses ye whiche ben togyders.

Also the taste / the smell / and ye touchyng ben in semblables varyacyons and innō¦brables paynes and tormentes. By the consydera∣cyon alonely of the paynes before sayd the whiche is a lytell thynge in comparyson of them the whi∣che folowen all vnderstondynge the whiche may vnto suche paynes come or hym kepe theder for to come sholde well in hymselfe conceyue on suche fe¦rechat / by that he hym enforce to do well / and all yll for to eschewe and fle / the whiche thynge is the ende vnto the which we entende in all the processe of this present boke. ¶ Here folowen in one maner of the generalyte of the paynes of the soule dampned. AFter y• forty paynes corporalles nombred and reherced before it behoueth some what to reherce of the paynes of the soule to the ende yt those the whiche wyll not or may not conceyue fere by the consyderacyon of the sayd paynes corporal¦les that for the spyrytualles they may come vnto the fere of the creature the whiche hath puyssaunce to dampne body and soule in helle / for the paynes spyrytualles ben more cruell and more to be doub∣tedEū timete  pōt {per} dee corp{us} & aiam i gehenam. of as moche that the soule is more greter thyng thā ye body / ye whiche cōparyson surmoūteth now the capacyte of vnderstondynge humayne in this (mater / and by
the consequent a man may not comprehende par∣fytly the paynes of the soule / for as it hath ben be∣fore sayd after saynt Austen they be moche more greter than a man may speke or thynke. And that notwitstondynge some thynge shall be here reher∣ced how be it that it be lytell / and fyrste in generall and secondly more in pertyculer. As vnto the fyrst it is to vnderstonde that vnto god the fader is gy∣uen puyssaunce infynyte / vnto god the sone sembla¦ble sapyence / and vnto the god the holy goost lyke bonte and buksōnes / and this blyssed trynyte one dyuynyte / one selfe essence / one maieste by his puys¦saunce / his sapyence and bonte to create soule rea∣sonable vnto his semblaūce / vnto his ymage / in gy¦uynge her mynde / vnderstondynge / and wyll in so hyghe degree of noblesse naturall that he vnto her hath gyuen fre choyse to do well or yll / soo that it shall procede of the free wyll / and yf she her wyll humble in yeldynge vnto god the obedyence and ye seruyce that she knoweth by reason naturall to be due vnto the creature / she her vnyeth with hym by grace beynge partener vnto the glorye of his dyuy¦nyte by so hygh excellence of dyuynyte that he her calleth the doughter of god / the espouse of Jhesu / cryste / and quene of paradyse. And she the whiche knoweth and may all thynges in god / And by the contrary whan so noble a creature her peruerteth contraryous and rebelle agayne god her creature ye whiche in suche wyse her hath autorysed endoned & ennobled and yt she wyll of her propre wyll agaȳ the cōmaundement and ordenaūce of her god crea¦tour and redemptour. The whiche thynge is agaȳ
all reason naturall. Than she supposeth vnto god her creatour / maketh of herselfe her god in presu∣mynge and sechynge dysordenatly in all thynges her propre honoure / her glorye / and her prayse / and for that / that suche god is nothynge folye and er∣roure / the poore soule myserable falleth & abydeth aduersary and contraryous vnto god the creatoure in whome is all goodnes and all puyssaunce infy∣nytly / and he oonly vnto whome is gyuen all ho∣noure. and therfore so as we see that derkenesses bē contraryes vnto lyght / beaute and honeste / vnto foulnes and vnto all fylth / pouerte / rychesse / helth syknes / the deth / vnto the lyfe and soo of all other thynges contraryous. In lyke wyse it behoueth to saye of the soule the whiche is contraryous and ad¦uersary vnto god And for as moche that in god as it is sayd / is puyssaunce / sapyence / bonte / beaute / rychesse / glorye / honoure / pleasures. delytes / lyfe / trouth / Justyce / equytes / swetnes / and all other per¦feccyons infynytly & without nombre / it foloweth well that in the soule the whiche by the abusyon of his propre wyll / is vnto hȳ contraryous in fermyn¦ge aduersarye and contraryous vnto the wyll dy∣uyne is all frowarde and the contrary of the thyn∣ges before sayd. That is to vnderstonde / debylyte and myserable feblenes / folye and cursydnes / hor∣ryble defermyte of foulnes / pouerte of all godenes so grete yt the deth / or to be adnychylate hym sholde seme to be for a grete good / mysery / & dyshonoure of all partes dyspleasaūce / dysease / paynes / and do lours without nombre & without mesure deth eter∣nall vnto hym is his partage and propre herytage
falsete / iniquyte / malyce / and suche crudelyte that he curseth god and all creatures in desyrynge that all the worlde were dampned as she notwithston∣dynge that she knoweth well that better with her it shall nothynge be but euer worse. And for asmo∣che yt she hath clere vnderstondynge of herselfe and that she knoweth & seeth her dysposycyon her dāp¦nacyon / & the ylles & the incōuenyētes before sayd & the whiche folowe wtout nōbre & without ende in the whiche is put & gyuen by her propre wyll. alsoCōmēducauerit liguas suaspre do lore & blasyhema∣uersit deū celi p̄ o loribus & vulneri bus suis. ao. xvi. she hath knowlege of ye goodes of the glorye that she hath loste by her defaute / And the whiche may neuer be recouered / and seeth that of all these ylles she oonly is the culpe and defaute / she hateth her¦selfe and curseth aboue all thynges. And in lyke wyse as she is dysordynatly loued she her selfe ha∣teth and of good ryght / and wolde she hadde neuer ben made but she may not haue ye thynge that she desyreth / who knoweth the foulnesand dyrte that she may not dryue a waye or wasshe her dyshonour that she may not recouer / her iniquyte that she may not correcte / her losse that she may not recouer / for the whiche thynges and for the greate rage in the whiche she is holden she byteth and eateth her han¦des and her tonge hath well to vnderstonde & she may not helselfe bere ne endure / wherfore there is none vnderstondynge tonge ne wrytynge by ye whi¦che a man may declare the payne and greuous ra¦ge of the dampned and this is as vnto the genera∣lyte of the paynes of hell of the partye of the sou∣le.
¶ Here foloweth of the ten paynes pryncypalles of the soule the whiche is dampned / and euery of thē dyuysed in foure. THe fyrst is of all glorye defayllynge. THe seconde remors wtout ende of cōscyence The thyrde Ire / rancure / and murmure. The fourth pryde and rebellyon harde. The fyfth of another mans welth cursyd enuy. The syxte is fere that moche men noyeth The .vii. payne is torment the whiche fayleth not. The .viii. is of all Joye defaute. The .ix. desyre of the deth ryght hydeous. The .x. is trybulacyon shamfull. THe fyrste payne is to be depryued from the glorye of paradyse / and for to vnderstonde some what the gretenes of this payne / it is well to be noted that as moche grete yll is the losse of someVisio dei totamer¦ces. gio. su{per} illud  ostē dāilli salutare meū.

Yf a man demaunde how moche the gre¦te yll of sykenes / a man may truely answere that it is as moche grete yll as helth is grete good for as moche as the sykenes is contraryous vnto helth. al¦so what yll is the deth / it is as moche grete yll as y• lyfe is grete good. In lyke wyse yf a man demaū∣de what yll is dampnacyon eternall / it is as moche grete yll as the glorye of paradyse is grete good. & for as moche that ye glorye of paradyse is more gre¦te good than the tormentes of payne sensytyue be¦fore sayd ben grete yll / it foloweth that the payne (of the dammage that these dampned soules
haue that is to be depreuyd from the beatytude eter¦nall is more grete yll than all the paynes corporal¦les before sayd. This payne of y• dōmage causeth foure greate and incōpreuables ylles vnto the dāp¦ned. The fyrste is to be depryued to see the blyssed trynyte the whiche is as moche grete yll / as god is grete good after as it is declared before / ymagen he that may and not I ye yll of suche losse & damp∣nacyon. And therfore sayth well saynt Austen that there is no saynt in paradyse but that loueth better to be in the fyre and tormentes of paynes and too see god than to be in the glorye of paradyse excepte to see good. The seconde yll is to de depreuyd from the cōsolacyon and glorye that the saued haue for the company & presente of blyssed angellys. The thyrde yll is to be depryued from ye Joye and glad¦nes that all sayntes haue for the presence the one of the other. The fourth yll is to be depryued from the contree and from the royalme of paradyse the whiche of good ryght is named the lande of lyfe / as this present worlde is well named the londe of deth. Wherfore it is to be notyd that as to lese a du∣che / or a royalme in this valee of mesery and of ye coūtre of deth and ryght peryllous to enhabyte / it is a thynge so moche ferefull and so moche playn¦nynge yt for to kepe hym from suche peryll / a man doeth armes / bataylles / assaultes / as ▪sholde euery man in the ryght of hymselfe to doo for to eschewe the losse of suche good as the royalme of paradyse. Wherof sayth saynt Gregorye that the leste of thePropter caritatē magnā hereditas illa oibus ē vna & singularis tota. saued haue entyerly and perfytly the possessyon of all paradyse / for charyte by the whiche a man lo∣ueth
his neyghbour as hymselfe maketh all go∣des to be comon specyally in the sayd royalme of paradyse. THe seconde payne of the partye of the soulevermis eo{rum} ō mo¦rietur. ysaie. vl. is named the worme or the remors of con∣scyence and a payne the whiche procedeth of clere knowlege the whiche than is in the soule / by ye whi∣che she knoweth she hadde ben saued yf she hadde wylled whan she sholde haue wylled to do the wer¦kes. Also she knoweth that in suche losse there is no recouer / and this vnto her is a dyspleaser incom¦preuable as we may see some what in this worlde of them the whiche by theyr defaute or neclygence. lesen a grete good that they ben in remors and in dyspleaser agayne themselfe / & this payne is aug∣mentedQuid {pro} fuit nobis su{per}bia aut diuicia rū iactāc  d no bis {con}tulit. ap̄. v. vnto the dampned of foure partes. The fyrste is of the mynde of all the synnes yt they euer dyde in theyr lyues / haue they be pardōned other tymes on this behalue or not / for in as moche that god them hath pardōned many synnes & by many tymes / of asmoche haue they be the more vnkynde to be retorned and fynally to dwelle in synnes. and whan they see the lytell pleaser / the prouffyte & the hardenes yt they haue had in sȳne & they felen the payne & knowen ye eternyte / thynke who so may ye rage in ye whiche they ben without ceasynge. The seconde is of the mynde that they haue of ye good dedes that he myght haue done in lytell tyme / as pe¦naūce & to purchase merytes and the royalme of pa¦radyse & that all is paste without euer there to haue remedy.

The whiche they hate soueraynly & vn∣to whome they may not resyste / in ony wyse flee / or escape. The fourth of the mynde of the goodes of grace that they haue other tymes hadde / or yt they myght haue hadde / of the whiche they haue loste ye meryte and retrybucyon the whiche was the vysyon of god and all the royalme and beatytude of para¦dyse. Also they haue clere knowlege of the bene∣fyce of the Incarnacyon of oure lorde and of his blyssed passyon / the whiche thynge vnto theym is as moche grete payne / as the loue and the benefyce was grete and incompreuable and vpon this yma∣gen profoundly euery creature after the grace that the swete Jhesus vnto hym shall gyue / for I am ynough certayne that none vnderstondynge create ne may it comprehende all playne.
THe thyrde payne of the soule is Ire / & ran∣cure incompreuable agayne foure thynges specyally. The fyrste is agayne the puyssaunce of god vnto the whiche they maye not resyste as yt is sayd / notwithstondynge that they it desyren so∣ueraynly & ben certayne to haue no power theder to come / by the whiche they ben in Ire intollerable. /: The seconde is agayne theyr mysery & dampna∣cyon in suche wyse yt euery of them is in sorowe & in anguysshe of his propre wyll & dōmage more or lesse after the colour & the dāmage. & for as moch y• the soule dampned hath clere knowlege of all her ylles she is enraged of an Ire without mesure. the thyrde is agayne the deuylles by y• temptacyon and suggestyon wherof they be comen vnto suche estate & also yt these tormentes ben wtout remedy. The fourth is agayne ye persones ye whiche other tymes haue consented vnto theyr synnes / or the which ha¦ue not done theyr deuour for to teche them / or cor¦recte & in regarde of this ye subieccyon agayn theyr prelates / ye chyldren agayne y• fader & moder / the harlotte agayne the harlotte / ben in suche a rage of Ire / that none may it thynke or wryte. THe fourth payne is pryde enuenumyd and they may not it auēge & it procedeth of. iiii partes. The fyrste is as vnto ye regarde of y• lorde¦shyp & dominacyon infynyte / & generall of y• crea¦ture & for asmoche yt the soule dāmpned it aduersa∣ry & cōtrarious vnto god she hath of asmoche grete dyspleaser of ye honour & domynacyō of ye creatu¦re as suche honour is excellent & grete. The secon
de is vnto the regarde of ye Justyce dyuyne / after y• whiche she her seeth aiuged vnto ye eternyte of ex∣cessyue paynes yt she feleth & endureth / & for asmo¦che yt she hath ben vniuste in vsurpynge glorye / ho¦nour / & the vsaūce of her propre wyll she is made & formed cōtraryous & aduersary of y• Justyce dyuy¦ne / by the whiche she abydeth Justely in ye obstyna¦cyon of her pryde / & by y• consequent of her tormēt wtout ende. The .iii. is vnto ye regarde of theyr pro¦pre wyll of ye whiche they haue made theyr god / & for y• / yt they haue loued suche god aboue all other thynges. & they hȳ se agayne ye cōtrary / & tormen∣ted wtout mesure / & as vnto ony maner of thyng de¦syred they may not come they ben in a se of anguys¦she torment. The .iiii. is vnto ye regarde of ye holy∣nes of vertues & of trouth yt she hath loste & to thē is cōtraryous / & alwayes seeth & knoweth yt trouth Justyce / & glorye arysen & ben taken frō theyr tor¦ment & from theyr payne by thē the whiche ben in paradyse / by the whiche she enrageth of dolour. THe fyfth payne of y• soule is of cruell enuy in regarde of four thȳges. The fyrste is of the bonte of god / for syns that she is contraryous vnto god as it is sayd / she hath in her the contrary of the proprytes and excellences the whiche ben in god. Now is it certayne that in god is pyte / swete∣nes / & mercy infynytly / by the whiche it foloweth that in the soule dampned there is enuy / crudelyte and anguysshe of all the goodnesses the whiche co¦me & proceden vnto creatures of the bonte. & mer¦cy of god. And for as moche that suche goodes
innumerables as well in nature āgelyque as in na¦ture humayne / as well in heuen as in erth the tor∣ment of y• enuy of those dampned may not be suf∣fycyently ymagyned. This tormēt is shewed som¦what of this present worlde in the torment yt these enuyous people suffren in the prosperyte of theyr neyghbours. The seconde is vnto the regarde of ye noblesse & excellence ye whiche is in nature angely∣que. The thyrde vnto the regarde of other blyssed men & women / for as it is grete and is shewed the mercy & bonte infynyte vnto ye saluacyon of y• mul¦tytude of the blyssed sayntes / of as moche is it gre¦te / and is multyplyed ye enrage of enuy of those y• ben dampned. The fourth is vnto ye regarde of ly¦tell chyldrē ye whiche ben deed in orygynall synne / The whiche shall be in ye fyre of hell wtout suffrȳ¦ge payne sensyble. In lyke wyse as sayth these doc¦tours & of yt company the which shall be ryght gre¦te / the dampned shall be affrayed for the crudelyte of theyr enuy vnto whome all welth shall be cōtra¦ryous as ynough it hath be shewed before. THe. vi. payne of ye soule is fere immuable in the whiche they were fyrste caste in to hell & cōdampned / for syns in helle there is no redēpcyon it behoueth to say yt they shall abyde in perpetuyte in ye degre of ye payne in ye whiche they ben fyrst cō¦dampned. this fere procedeth of foure thynges. the fyrste is vnto the regarde of ye Juge yt they knowē to be puyssaūte & of iustyce infynyte. Also they kno¦wen yt theyr iniquyte is incompreuable and damp∣nable and of suche comparyson and knowlege pro¦cedeth
fere seruyle inestymable and without euer to cease. The seconde is vnto the regarde of ye com¦pany of men and of women dampned / for it fau∣teth not to ymagen that they ben lesse ferefull in helle that they were on this halue / but more in as moche that they may more suffre of fere than they haue had on this halue. Now is it so that yf they had seen or mette one dampned on this halue they had had fere to haue ben madde / thynke than who that may vnto what thynge it may be in the other worlde / where these dampned fynen an hundreth thousande myllyons The thyrde is vnto y• regarde of deuylles / for in as moche that they haue not fe¦ryd vnto them to obeye in this worlde / it is ye good Justyce of god that they feren theyr presence / theyr lokes and theyr tormentes in helle eternally. This fere ouer that / that it is naturall it is grauyd after the Justyce dyuyne in forme and maner iudycyble The fourth is vnto the regarde of the grete & hor¦ryble paynes of hell / as for an example. Yf a man shew vnto ony in this present lyfe a water hote / or a metall molten and that a man hym certefye that he therin shall be put by Justyce / by the espace of a moneth or of a yere / he sholde haue moche greate drede & greate fere aduyse euery creature after that that he may ymagen the vnderstondynge of soules dampned the whiche be not in nothynge taryed / but more soner aboue all nature ayded and chosen to vnderstonde clerely as well the paynes corporal¦les as spyrytualles the whiche vnto them ben ma∣de redy vnto / to that thynke he that may.
THe seuenth payne of the soule dampned is certaynte yt neuer in suche payne there shall be ende / terme / respyte / or releasynge for four thȳ¦ges / The fyrste is for the reason of hym that she hath offended by her synne that is god the whiche is infynyte and eternall: The seconde is by reason of the nature of synne fynall / That is to vnder∣stonde he the whiche at thdeth is founde without true repentaūce. The thyrde is vnto the regarde of the Justyce dyuyne. But for as moche as of that eternyte of paynes due vnto euery synne mortall shall be a chapytrin the ende of thys mater / it is not as nowe necessarye other wyse to drawe these foure poyntes or payne / . THe eyght payne of the soule dampned is de¦faute of all consolacyon the whiche defau∣te vnto them cometh of foure partes / The fyrste is in the regarde of the dyuyne fountayne of Joye and of consolacyon / from the whiche the cursyd dampned ben put fer awaye and departed. By the whiche they ben fallen in to the contrarye partye / That is to vnderstonde in to the see and in to the depenesses of heuynesses and of all desolacyon. /: The seconde is in regarde of nature angelyque the whiche after god is the synguler consolacyon of na¦ture humayne specyally vnto the speryte / and for as moche that these dampned haue not obeyed vn¦to ye good inspyracyons of theyr holy angelles but more soner to ye suggestyōs of theyr gostly enemy
in stede of the kepyng and consolacyon angelyque they haue ye presence and the desolucyon inestyma∣ble of deuylles. The thyrde is in regarde of ye holy cōpany of those that ben blyssed / as is Jhesu cryste the vyrgyn Mary / and all those other holy sayntes of paradyse the whiche haue not in ony maner cō∣passyon of those that ben dampned / but they enyo¦ye in the crudelyte and eternyte of theyr tormentes the whiche thynge y• dampned seeth and knoweth By the whiche they ben inestymably tormented & dyscomforted. The fourth is vnto the regarde of the company of the dampned / for the one shal not haue compassyon of the other. By the whiche they curse eche other / and so shall be depryued from all cōpassyon / as well of those of paradyse / as of them of helle. nor in them selfe they may not in ony wyse haue it / but they it hate and curse pryncypally / for they ben the cause defayllynge of all / of all the tor∣mentes vnto the whiche the ben come. THe .ix. payne of the soule dampned is desy¦re to mowe dye vnto the whiche she may ne¦uer come. Of good ryght they may not fynde the deth in the other worlde the whiche haue refused ye lyfe on this behalue. By the whiche they desyren foure thynges / vnto the whiche they may not come The fyrste is that they wolde they hadde not ben create. The seconde that they myght be as nothȳ¦ge. The thyrde that they hadde not ben redemyd / The fourth that they sholde not aryse. For in lyke
wyse as these foure thynges ben greate glorye and gladnes vnto the blyssed. In lyke wyse it is anoy∣saunce and heuynes vnto those acursyd more than euer man may thynke. THe tenth payne of the soule dampned is cō∣fusyble retrybucōn for four thynges. The fyrste is for that / that the dampned ben certayne yt god the whiche is theyr aduersary seeth theyr con∣fusyble dampnayon / for in lyke wyse as to se god is eternall & perfyte retrybucyon vnto the blyssed / In lyke wyse to be seen of god in eternall dampna¦cyon is inestymable confusyon in all these damp∣ned & some what appereth the confusyon / of y• tor¦ment in this worlde / for a thefe hath shame to be seen & knowen in his theft of ony man notable. but soueraynly he sholde fere to be seen of hym y• whi∣che hȳ shall Juge. The seconde is for as moche yt the tormentes & the multytude & theyr greuys ben in y• clere vysyon & knowlege of god not aloonly / but wt hȳ & all the court celestyn / & in lyke wyse as y• glorye of the blyssed is gretely trurstyd by ye dāp∣nacyon of those acursyd. In lyke wyse y• dāpnaciō of those reproued is a grauyte inestymable by cause of y• knowlege of those y• ben saued. of y• maner of this syght no theologiē ne ought to doubte for they of paradyse see in god all ye thynges ye whiche ben to y• augmentacōn of theyr glorye / as bē y• tormētes of hell in lyke wyse as it hath ben sayd before. and shall be more playnly in y• chapytre of y• eternyte of y• paȳes internalles. Also yf ony make meruay¦le how it may be y• a chylde sauyd shall haue as gre
te Joye and as perfyte gladnes of the dampnacōn of his fader / and of his moder / or of the one of thē or the fader & the moder sauyd of the dampnacōn of theyr chylde & other frendes. The wyll of the sauyd is in suche wyse vnyed with the wyll dyuyne that all yt / that god wyll / is the Joye & the wyll ry∣ght parfyte of all the sauyd for yt / that god wolde or sholde wyll after the puyssaunce & Justyce vnto that dampnacyon & for as moche is it the wyll and glorye of all those yt ben chosen. The thyrde is of the lokes of one vpon another / for euery of theym shall see the synne & the conscyece / the one of the other / & for yt / that soule resonable notwtstondynge that she be dampned leseth not her propryte yt she had shame of her sȳne & of her confusyon she shal be in souerayne angre in herselfe & vnto the syght of all the worlde as well of the sauyd as of ye damp¦ned. The fourth is for asmoche as she seeth clerely the multytude of her synnes the grefe and the vn∣kyndenes that she hath commytted agayne ye crea∣tour / and so as the sauyd haue in themselfe a Joye & a gladnes of the good dedys yt they haue done in this worlde▪ In lyke wyse the dampned seynge all theyr synnes shall haue for euery synne partyculer shame and abhomynacyon & incompreuable cōfu¦syon. Now beholde who y• may what it shall be of all togyders / by these thynges before sayd it appe∣reth that there are .xl. paynes partyculers of y• par¦tye of the body & in lyke wyse as many of y• soule And so there ben foure score paynes partyculers in euery dampned in body & in soule / for as it is sayd
all the fyue wyttes of nature. That is the syght / y• herynge / the smellynge / the taste / & the touchynge Also the bones / the mary / the synewes / the vaynes the flesshe / the blode / the humours / & qualytes cor∣poralles shall be replenysshed with souerayne & in dycybles / dolours / & anguysshes. Also all y• puys∣saunces of the soule / as the mynde / y• vnderstondȳ¦ge / and the wyll / shall be in Ire / and in rancure / in pyrde & in rebellyon / in obstynacyon / & in profoun¦dyte of souerayne / eternall desolacyon / & of confu¦syons and so innōbrables that yf all y• see were yn ke for to wryte / and the skye and all the foure ale∣mentes parchement drawen in length / & all y• ton¦ges of the blessyd sesse not in an hondreth yeres to name & to nombre the partyculer paynes vnto the whiche is adiuged & condampned euery dampned a man myght not speke nor wryte in an hundreth thousande yere the paynes of one dampned aloon¦ly / for yf for euery yere that he shall be in helle he myght wepe one oonly tere / whan he hadde so mo¦che wepte that it amounteth all the see / yet sholde it not be but a maner to begynne his torment and his wepynge. Also yf he were a stone a thousande tymes more greater than all the erth and that there came a byrde / and from an hondreth thousand ye∣res vnto an hondreth thousande yeres and none of tener and for euery vyage he taketh and consu∣meth of the sayd stone also grete aloonly as is the tenth parte of a corne of whete. In suche wyse that in ten hondreth thousande yeres he had not ta¦ken of y• stone but ye moūtenaūce of a grayne of the
sayd corne and that god had made promesse to one dampned y• whan the sayd stone sholde be all eten and no sooner he sholde haue than y• glorye of pa∣radyse but in the releasynge of his payne / the sayd dāpned sholde be now lately dyschargyd of one of the horryble tormentes of hell yt is y• he sholde haue hope of y• tyme & of ye houre y• the stone sholde be al eeten / & that than he sholde haue some releasynge But alas alas & a. C. thousāde tymes alas / & whā shall y• be / And euer more all y• dampned ben depry¦ued & put from suche truste & from euery other ho¦pe or remedye / & ben certayne yt for euer withoute ende & eternally they shall be in payne & in the tor¦ment that they fele & endure / & this payne is dys∣payre / no creature it can suffycyently thynke. O hertes pyteous thynke profoūdly where shall beco∣me your aege & your tymes / thynke where is your loue & your vnderstondynge / thynke yf ye be in the waye of glorye / or of torment & ymagen that there are an hondreth myllyons in helle yt yf they had y• fourth parte of the halfe houre to do penaūce and to recouer mercy in suche wyse that it to do ye haue the dayes the monthes and the yeres they sholde do dylygence and suche penaunce the whiche there they shall neuer fynde / y• whiche thynge they shall neuer recouer. Alas thynke who that may / the we pynges / the waylynges / the lamentacyons / and ye complayntes that they make in sessybly in cursyn¦ge the houre that they were euer begoten / that euer they were borne of theyr moder / that euer they we¦re nourysshed and gyuen souke / they haue conty∣nually
in the mynde and in the vnderstondynge ye grete goodes that they haue loste. & the grete ylles in to ye whiche they ben come / by the whiche they may saye. Alas where is become ye tyme in y• why∣che we myght haue ben sauyd full lytell whyle ha¦ue endured our laughynges our playes / / & our ple¦surs of y• worlde. Alas what haue prouffyted vs ho¦nours / rychesses / & delytes / grete castelles / houses / dygnytes / offyces / all is paste more sooner than y• wynde & with s abydeth not but ye maledyccyon of god / mysery & torment / cursyd be ye houre yt we hadde not ben famysshed & deed more sooner thanMale dicetregisu & deo fuo. ysu. vii borne / we haue loste y• meryte of y• passyon / we ha¦ue loste paradyse & eternall benedyccyon / alas god wherfore haste thou vs create / cursyd be the creatu¦re of creatures / & the houre also of ye creacyon / well ben we acursyd & cōfoūded / we haue fere to crye to curse / & blaspheme ye one may not y• other comfort but well awaye may eche with other sorowe. O how moche is this horryble thynge cruell & to re∣doubte as to offende god & his cōmaūdementes to trespasse but to late it is hym to aduyse & repent. su¦che remors & other without nombre ben in y• songe of y• acursyd / of ye estate of whome & of theyr pay∣nes none ne may speke nor wryte playnly / in cōpa¦ryson of y• / that they suffre / but yt notwithstondȳ∣ge who y• well taketh hede & weyeth in his herte y• the whiche is sayd and reherced in this treatyse he shall conceyue fere yf euer by meane of wrytynge / or by other waye erthely he yt sholde conceyue and vnto that purpose is founde by scrypture that a yo
geler a man excessyuely worldely and of all vany∣te playnly named Fulques one tyme amonge other was layde in a fayre bedde softe & pleasaūte but he myght not slepe as he desyred & hym it ennoyed that the lyght of the daye came not vnto hym no sooner / not for to here masse / or ellys for to praye vnto god / but for to excercyse his folyes and his va¦nytes worldly. And he beynge in suche ennoysaūce thought in hymselfe profoūdly what ennoye and doloure he myght haue yf he were condāpned hym to holde and abyde in the bedde where he laye tyll vnto y• espace of two or of thre yeres wtout seynge other lyght / or persone / & conceyued in hymselfe yt for no sōme of golde / or of syluer / he wolde suffre to be comdampned vnto suche ennoye & suche tor∣ment. And afterwarde thought yet more profound¦ly what it myght be of those the whiche haue not done suffycyently penaunce on this behalue / by the whiche they ben Justely adiuged to be an hondreth yeres and some other more / & other lesse in tormen¦tes and in the sharpe fyre of purgatorye / the whi∣che is so harde and so anguysshous a thynge to be∣re & endure / yt none ne may it thynke / and moche he meruaylled of the payne / and of y• ennoye that they myght haue in awaytynge the daye of glad∣nes that they sholde be crowned in the royalme of paradyse & delyuered from all the paynes for euer without ende. But so as god wolde he thought mo¦re profoundly what it myght be of those the whi∣che ben in helle dampned in eternyte of tormentes who awayte not nor truste not for euer to haue so∣cours ne lyghtynge in ony space of dayes or of myl¦lyons
of yeres / and by this consyderacyon and thȳ kynge he conceyued suche fere / and so grete admy∣racyon that for his folysshe and cursyd lyfe he my¦ght not one tyme come vnto suche confusyon whe∣re incontynent he dysposed hȳ to leue his lyfe worl¦dely & ryght peryllous in cōsyderynge y• with gre∣te payne / and well late thynken these worldly peo¦ple of thynges y• whiche vnto them ben fynally for to come / & after in full fewe dayes lefte y• worlde & entred in to y• relegyon of cystoriencis in y• which he prouffyted so gretely in thynkynge on y• paynes of helle. the Joyes of paradyse & other holy medy∣tacyons / y• for his grete holynes & medytacyon and perfeccōn of good lyfe he was chosen ryght holely bysshop of tholouse / in y• whiche offyce & dygnyte he ended vnto y• glorye of god his dayes. By this example appereth clerely the grete prouffyte y• whi¦che came of holy medytacyon & to thynke on the paynes of helle & vnto the eternyte of theyr harde¦nes. And therfore to y• ende y• those y• whiche wyll studye in this present booke hauynge mater more haboūdantly offere & to esmeruayll y• eternyte of the sayd paynes of helle. Here foloweth a chapytre in y• whiche ben contayned many causes & reasons sheweth wherfore god punyssheth synne eternally. without euer there to haue an ende. ¶ Here foloweth the chapytre of y• causes & reasōs wherfore ye paynes of helle sholde be eternall. NOtwithstondynge that some thynge hath ben touched of the eternyte of paynes & tor¦mentes
of them reproued yet for the more greater admyracyon and also for to mete with folysshe sē¦tences & oppynyons yt the deuyll soweth amonge the hertes of many worldly people blynded & dow¦ed in theyr synnes. Here folowen many causes and reasons by the whiche it is euydently shewed y• the sayd paynes ought to be eternalles wtout euer there to haue releasynge / & pryncypally for thre reasons generalles. The fyrste is vnto ye regarde of y• con∣dycyon of mortall synne. The seconde vnto the re∣garde of the creatour the whiche is gloryous & eter¦nall. The thyrde is the consyderacyon of the vny∣uersall worlde. AS vnto the fyrste yt is of the consyderacōn of synne it is to vnderstonde yt for four rea∣sons Justyce dyuyne requyreth y• synne be punys∣shed in eternyte. The fyrste is for yt / that after all Jugement of reason / ye offence of sȳne ought to be wyed & punysshed after the dygnyte / grete / lytell or meane of hym the whiche is offended / for none ne may ymagen yt it were no grete offence to stryke vniustely a bysshop thā a symple chapelayne / or y• souerayn bysshop yt is y• pope thā another man of the chirche in lesse dygnyte. Now is it soo that by euery synne mortall god is offended soueraynly & as moche greuously as his maieste is dygne & infy¦nyte. By the whiche it foloweth that Justyce requy¦reth payne who answereth / & by the consequent in¦fynyte for euery mortall synne. The seconde rea∣son is for as moche that by mortall synne euery (creature is depryued from
welth eternall the whiche is god / and by suche wy¦se he hym submytteth vnto his oposyte / y• is damp nacyon eternall. The thyrde reason is for asmoche y• mortall synne depryueth y• creature from welth paste / present / & to come. The welth paste yt is the passyon of y• blyssed Jhesu cryste without ye whiche it were vnpossyble vnto all ye worlde to mowe eua¦de the bondes of y• deuyll / and euer more by mor∣tall synne a man hym depryueth from suche bene¦fyce. The good present yt is the meryte of holy chir¦che from the whiche the synner beynge as a syn∣ner is depryued & seueryd. The goodes to come yt ben the goodes of glorye y• whiche by good Justy∣ce sholde not be gyuen in ony wyse vnto those the whiche ben enemyes & aduersaryes vnto the crea∣toure as ben all those y• whiche fynally abyden in mortall synne. The fourth reason is for asmoche that mortall synne of his propre condycyon destro¦yeth all the good dedes of the creature y• whiche he cōmytted / for euery thynge destroyeth his contrary in as moche as is in hym / as it appereth of fyre & of water / of lyght and of derkenes / and so of other thynges contraryes. Now is it ynough certayne yt there is nothynge contraryous vnto the wyll dy∣uyne but oonly synne / and by the consequent syn∣ne destroyeth and putteth vnto nought as moche as is in hym the wyll dyuyne and so putteth all y• blyssed Trynyte vnto nothynge and in suche wy∣se he destroyeth all the worlde / as well the holy men & women of paradyse / as also all these other creatures / for it is Impossyble that creature may
be to haue enduryd but in that / that god hym hol¦deth and conserueth and yf god be dystroyed by sȳ¦ne the whiche aloonly vnto hym is contrary / euery creature is deed and destroyed in the deth of theIn iterno aūt s fitebi tibi quas dicerʐ null{us}. p̄. vi. I tē qr nō ifernus cōfitebit tibi ne{que} morslaudabit ten̄ expectabūt  descē dut ī lacūveritaē tuā. vsa. xxx viii. creatour. But it is a thynge impossyble ye god may not be / or to dye / by the whiche it foloweth & beho¦ueth yt synne be punysshed after ye puyssaūce / sapy¦ence & eternyte of his contrary yt is god / & yf it we¦re not done / there sholde be defaute of Justyce. and yf Justyce dyuyne and infynyte defayle / god shold defayle / Also the synner the whiche dyeth in mor∣tall synne / synneth in eternyte / for yf he alwayes hadde lyued / alwayes he hadde synned. And in as moche as that he endureth in synne / he oughte to endure punycyon. Also yf the sȳne the whiche euer endureth were not for euer punysshed / the Justyce penytyue sholde be to moche vnlawfully dyuynys¦shed and all trouth dyuyne defraudyd / ye anoyn∣tyd the whiche ben thynges to moche impossybles. Also as moche grete is the transgressyon / as y• gre¦te oblygacyon. Now is it trouth that euery creatu∣re is bounde to serue and honoure his creatour the whiche thynge he may not do the whiche is in de∣dely synne / but more sooner doth the contrary that is to knowe to blaspheme and to dyshonoure god. By the whiche he is the transgressour of the lawe dyuyne and of nature the whiche ben lawes eternal les. By the whiche it foloweth that suche trans∣gressyon ought to be punysshed eternally.
AS vnto the seconde poynt the whiche is in the comparyson of the synne / and of the creature agayne whome it is done / it is to vnder∣stonde that for foure reasons he ought to be punys¦shed eternally. The fyrste is for the grace that god hath done vnto the creature humayne / For of as moche as the grace / or the benefyce done vnto ony is grete / of as moche is greter the offence or the for fayte of hym the whiche is redeuable / or shall yel∣de accompte before hym whome he ought to serue & honoure / As for an example. The kynge gyueth a thousande pounde of rente vnto one knyght and vnto another an hundreth thousands pounde both tweyne offende and commytte treason agayne the kynge. Than it shall be Jugyd that the treason of hym the whiche hadde an hundreth thousande pounde is more greuous thanne is that of hym ye whiche hadde not but aloonly a thousande poun∣de / and therfore for as moche that an hundreth thousande pounde is more greater thynge thenne a thousande pounde aloonly. And vnto the pur∣pose god vnto vs hath gyuen the body and the sou¦le the whiche ben also as the two knyghtes / vnto the body he hath gyuen / syght / tastynge / smellyn∣ge and herynge / and so of other gyftes corporalles but vnto the soule he hath gyuen vnderstondynge mynde / and in creatynge her vnto his ymage and vnto his semblaunce in gyuynge vnto her hym the whiche is the good and tresour infynyte / and not (withstondynge that she
it forfayteth & cōmytteth treason as many tymes and as often as whan she her consenteth vnto de∣dely synne / for she withdraweth ye honoure the obe¦dyence / and the glory that she oweth vnto her crea∣toure by ye whiche it behoueth to saye y• as is moch grete the offence as was grete the benefyce / and for as moche that he was infynyte / also is the trans∣gressyon and punycyon infynyte by so ryght Justy¦ce that ony creature nedeth to doubte. The seconde reason is by cause of the iniury done vnto god in that / that the soule her consenteth vnto the gylte of mortall synne choseth and loueth better ony good create than she doeth her creatour. Now is it so y• bytwene the good creatyd what soo euer that it be & the good increatyd ye whiche is god vnto ye dystā¦ce infynyte & of as moche yt the good that a man choseth more sooner than a man doeth god is lytel the iniury is y• more grete as vnto the consyderacy on / by the whiche it appereth yt lecherous men and women the whiche maketh of they belly and of theyr pleasure of theyr sensualyte theyr god / and the couetyse men and women of theyr golde & of theyr syluer / & proude men and women of wynde of abusyon and of vayne glorye doeth horryble in iury vnto god & infynyte and may not abyde vn∣punysshed after as it vnto hym appertayneth that is to knowe infynytly / or elles he sholde not be the god of Justyce infynyte ye whiche is a thynge Im∣possyble. The thyrde reason is by cause of the maie¦ste dyuyne y• whiche hath be ynough shewed before That is to vnderstonde of asmoche that he ye whi¦che is offended / is of more grete noblesse / dygnyte
sapyence / Jurysdyccyon / and auctoryte / and of as moche that a man is more holden and bounde / of as moche is the offence agayne hym y• more greate And for as moche yt god is of maieste infynyte and yt the creature vnto hym is boūde infynytly That is to saye asmoche as she hath beynge / substaunce and other goodes / ben they of nature / of grace / or of fortune it foloweth clerely yt the offence of mor¦tall synne ought to be infynytly punysshed. The fourth reason is by cause of the Justyce dyuyne the whiche thynge he may also shewe / yf it appertay¦ne vnto ye Justyce & mercy dyuyne to rewarde the blessyd in eternyte of glorye / for ye obedyēce / honour & reuerence yt they haue done vnto theyr creatour in this worlde by yt same selfe Justyce it behoueth yt he punysshe eternally ye inobedyence / y• dyshonour & irreuerence yt these cursyd dampned haue done to god theyr creatour in this present lyfe. AS vnto y• thyrde poynt pryncypall & fynal the whiche is yt sȳne ought to be punysshed in eternyte after y• comparyson y• it hath vnto the vnyuersall worlde / it is to vnderstonde ye euery per sone of his propre nature & condycyon desyreth to come vnto welth eternall. & therfore ye soule ye whi¦che her consenteth vnto mortall synne / choseth so∣me good create / as ben honours / in proude people rychesses in couetyse people / delytes pleasurs car∣nalles vnto lecherous people / he constytuteth hys ende / and blyssednes in ye thynge yt he desyreth so∣ueraynly & all these thynges the whiche hym may
serue / be it god / the sayntes the angelles or other thynge for to come vnto suche ende / he them desy∣reth not but by the ende & felycyte before sayd and of suche people is there without nombre yt wolde ha¦ue in this worlde yt / that they desyre & neuer to see god or other blessydnes to haue. And for as moche yt in suche loue & suche desyre they ben foūde at the houre of deth / it is not agayne the inclynacyon na¦turall of the soule. That is to vnderstonde that she abydeth in her eternyte vnder the punycyon of the deceuable beatytude yt she hath chosen aboue god & agayne god / and this is for the fyrste reason of ye thyrde poynt ye whiche sheweth wherfore the puny cyon of the dampned ought to be eternall. The se¦conde reason hath ben lately touched before / for y• perfeccyon of the worlde vnyuersall requyreth that he there hath felycyte eternall / and this here is or∣dened by Justyce vnto them the whiche haue resys¦ted and foughten in this present lyfe agayne theyr sensualyte and propre wyll agayne the worlde andIn mēsurā cōtra mēsurā cā abiecta fuerit iudicabit dn̄s. ysa. xxvii. c.

And by that same selfe Justyce behoueth it that pu¦nycyon eternall be prepayred & reseruyd vnto them the whiche haue not wylled to fyght / but haue obe¦yed vnto theyr aduersaryes / and soo whan euery creature shall haue Juste retrybucyon after his nie¦rytes / or demerytes / all the worlde shall be in her perfeccyon / In the whiche he shall haue no more / as to adde / to mynysshe / or to varye / for it apper∣tayneth vnto the puyssaunce / sapyence and Justy¦ce dyuyne to conserue all thynges in theyr fynalle perfeccyons. The thyrde reason for the grete vtyly
te the whiche cometh of the eternyte and mysery of the dampned vnto the perfeccyon of the vnyuersall worlde / for fyrste god is feryd soueraynly. Also his commaundementes ben kepte the more humbly &Deo eī militat oē quod obstat. her ¦lexāder de halis. the more dylygently / and in so doynge a man pur¦chaseth fynally ferefylyale or chyldly meryte and saluacyon. And therfore to saye that the paynes of the dampned ben and ought to be eternall / it is no pyte / but souerayne iniquyte and manyfeste subuer¦cyon of the trouth of god conteyned and shewed in holy scryptures & all the destruccyon of oure holy fayth catholyque. The fourth reason of the eterny¦te of ye paynes of the dampned yt is for ye glorye of the creatour ye whiche is ye souerayne ende wherforeQui bona egert ibūt i vitā eternā.  vero malo i ign etnū. Hec ē fides catholica &c. hec a∣thana. i sym. all thynges ben create / made / formed / & ordeyned The whiche glorye shyneth & is shewed vnto all the worlde / grete noble & infynyte / in as moche yt y• multytude of ye dāpned & theyr paynes / dolours & tormentes ben grete innumerable & eternall. for in lyke wyse as the mercy infynyte of ye creatour is shewed / in ye grete beatytude or blessydnes of para∣dyse / so is manyfested ye Justyce by the eternyte of ye tormentes of y• dampmed / and of suche many∣festacyon of mercy and of Justyce cometh and ac¦cordeth a melodye of glorye wherof sayth holy scryp¦ture that a man ought to synge before god the ver¦sycle / or the songe of mercy and of Justyce. by the whiche we may vnderstonde & also it see in practy∣se yt melodye of musyque may not be perfyte yf the¦reMisericordiā & in diciuiu cārabo ivi domine. p̄s. be not parfeccyon of tenoure / and yf the tenoure were not eternall the melodye sholde not be eternal (In lyke wyse the
melodye of the glorye of the blessyd shall not haue tenour yf the paynes of the dampned were not eter¦nalle / I vnderstonde by the tenour of the gloryous melodye of paradyse the crye and the braye and horryble thondre of helle. By ye counter tenoure ye ioye & the gladnes of the blessed men & women of paradyse. By the florysshynge of that melodyous musyque I vnderstonde the Joye and exaltacyon and the gladnes angelyque the whiche incompreua¦ble and inenarrable / for she is not aloonly in ioye corporall but with that in the ees of the soule. In lyke wyse as it shall be drawen in the treatyse of the Joyes of paradyse / vnto the whiche vs wyll brynge and lede the swete Jesus vnto whome be al honoure and glorye with the fader and the holy goost. AMEN ¶ Here after foloweth the treatyse of the Joyes of paradyse and fyrste the prologue for the fyfth cha∣pytre.
AFter the treatyse of the paynes of helle here foloweth of the Joyes of paradyse by the consyderacyon of whome & mouynge the lyght of the holy fayth catholyque / the wyll / the desyre and the loue of herte humayne is drawe vpwarde / for in lyke wyse as by the consyderacyon of ye horryble paynes before wryten a man cometh vnto fere / gre¦te lytell / or meane / after as y• vnderstondynge and cōsyderacyon of those paynes / is grete or lytell. euen so in lyke wyse cometh a man for to loue and to de¦syre the Joyes of paradyse after that they ben con¦sydered moche or lytell of herte humayne wherof for to excercyse the loue and the desyre of herte hu
mayne for to purchase the glorye of paradyse some thynge I put that it be lytell is here after wryten fyrste in generall & secondly more in especyall. As vnto the fyrste it is to vnderstonde that after as sa¦ynt Austen sayth / a mortall man may not speke or ymagen the multytude the gretenes / and ye nobles of the Ioyes of paradyse / for they ben moche grea¦ter than tonge ne can tell / or herte ne may thynke There is founde souerayne pease without warre reste without labour / Ioye without sorow / infynyte rychesses / faythfulnes / yongth / and gladnes foun∣tayne of all goodes that vnderstondynge may thyn¦ke / or that herte may desyre / for the blessyd see god face to face / and all other thynges in god and god in them selfe. Also they see the humanyte of Ihe∣su cryste / they see the vyrgyn Mary / and all her ho¦ly company of the blessyd vyrgyns / of the whiche vysyon sayth saynt Austen and also saynt Grego¦rye that who so it sholde not haue but by the espace of one Iourney aloonly a man sholde for to purcha¦se suche good desprayse all ye rychesses / & honours pleasurs / and delytes that a mā myght haue in an hondreth myllyons of yeres in this present worlde and with that to suffre all the martyrdomes / an∣guysses and-orowes the whiche may be spoken or thought. That is to knowe for to come vnto gode for to mowe see in so lytell espace of tyme the bles∣sydnes the whiche is promysed vnto all the frendes of god to possede eternally. O blessyd very god eter¦nall / that these poore blynde worldly people may not suche meruaylles / here / rede / or vnderstonde so¦me what / for than may they cōprehende certaynly

And in lyke wyse ten of the body contraryes & opposytes vnto the paynes and tormentes of the dampned. / And euery of them shall be dyuysed in foure by the consyderacyon of the whiche Ioyes the espyryte hu¦mayne shall not be aloonly a slepe / but ryally de∣de and insensyble the whiche hym shall not moue by a feruent desyre for to come vnto welth incom∣parable. The whiche thynge is the pryncypall en∣de and intencyon of all the processe of this present booke. ¶ Here foloweth the ten pryncypall Ioyes of the partye of the soule. The fyrste of god ryght clere knowlege. The seconde the loue of all his puyssaunce. The thyrde with hym wtout ende to abyde. The fourth Ioye the whiche euer shall endure. The .v. of all welth ryght large haboūdance. The syxte grete honoure and grete reuerence. The .vii. beaute of y• soule meruaylous. The .viii. parfyte pease & gracyous. The .ix. refeccyon desyderable.
The tenth felycyte muaryable. THe fyrste Ioye of paradyse of the partye ofCaplm .vi. the soule is the clere vysyon of god and of all other thynges the whiche appertayne vnto the glorye of ye sauyd. Wherfore it is to be noted that ye blessyd shall haue thre maner of knowleges. The fyrste is named the knowlege in the clerenes of the myddaye the whiche is none other thynge to vn∣derstonde but to see ryght parfytly the essence dy∣uyne. The seconde is named the knowlege in the clerenes of the mornynge / that isto knowe all the creatures spyrytualles or corporalles in ye myrrour of the blessyd trynyte that is to vnderstonde in the blessyd sone of god vnto whome is graunted / sapy¦ence eternall. The thyrde is named the knowlege in the clerenes of the euentyde that is to knowe the creatures in theyr propre essences and natures. By the whiche appereth that this Ioye of the clere vy¦syon shall procede of foure partes. The fyrste shal be to se the dyuynyte the whiche neuer creature seeth in this mortall lyfe but in the lyght of the fayth than he hym shall shewe ryght clerely / and after as wytnesseth holy scrypture the soule shall be in suche wyse transumed in god that in her the which is vnto the ymage of the blessyd trynyte shall ap∣pere vnto all the worlde the souerayne puyssaunce sapyence / and boūte the whiche ben in god & shall be than semblaūte vnto god by grace dyuyne. who shall be more shynynge than is the sōne for her cle¦renes: Of this vysyon or knowlege the whiche is in compreuable as for this present lyfe cometh and
procedeth a loue the whiche is as moche grete as is that knowlege and of the loue & knowlege cometh and procedeth Ioye as moche grete as ben knowle¦ge & loue / & they ben inestymables. Also is the ioye whiche of it procedeth / & than whan the soule her shall see the doughter and the espouse of the kynge eternall enherytour and in ye ryall possessyon of the royalme of paradyse for euer eternally. Who may it thynke what Ioye she may haue / for in suche cō¦templacyon ye derkenes of my lytyll vnderstondyn¦ge defauteth. The seconde shall be vnto the blessyd cōpany of paradyse as well angelyque as humayn & of the gretenes & multytude of merytes of all the sayntes / the whiche thynge may be som what vnder stonde yf a man vnderstonde the perfeccyon of the charyte y• whiche is in paradyse. That is to vn∣derstonde y• euery of them loueth his neyghboure as hymselfe / to loue some thynge proprely / that is to wyll hym good / and hȳ to reioyse of his honour of his Ioye / of his blessydnes / of his rychesse / and of his wysdome / of his promesse and soo of other gyftes and perfeccyons as well of the partye of the body as of the partye of the soule. Wherfore it be∣houeth to conclude yt euery of them that ben blessyd hath partyculer Ioye of all the sauyd / of whome some may not be more blessyd / other lesse / & other egally. and for to haue mater of meruaylous con∣templacyon and ymagynacyon / and in lyke wyse is it royally where that one sauyd seeth & knoweth an hundreth thousande the whiche ben egall vnto hym in glorye it behoueth to saye yf he loue theyr welth as his owne that he hath an hundreth thou∣sande
tymes more grete Joye of theyr glorye than he hath of his owne propre and synguler / ymagen we secondly that he seeth & knoweth hondreth myl¦lyons of whome euery of them hath more of glory by the halfe than he hath / it behoueth to saye ye an hondreth myllyons of tymes in double / he hath mo¦re grete Joye of suche multytude of the sauyd than he hath of his synguler Joye. & yf mortall man we¦re neuer on this halue suffycyent for to nōbre or for to wryte ye glorye partyculer of ye leste sauyd / what may it be / what may a man saye of this present cō¦paryson vnto suche multytude of the sauyd. Also sayth & practyseth saynt Barnardyn yt euery of ye sayntes of paradyse hath more grete ioye of y• glo∣rye y• whiche is in ye blessed vyrgyn Mry than of his owne propre / & of yt that he may haue of all the courte celestyall aboue of her of asmoche as her me rytes & her graces exceden y• gyftes & the graces of all those y• ben chosen / In y• whiche dyfferrence of meryte a man may ryally ymagen as moche grete excesse as he may haue in y• circōferēce of ye skye in comparyson of  centre of the erth / for she is the na¦turall moder of god ye whiche pryuylege excedeth al the excellences y• a man may speke or thynke. also the wye that euery of ye sauyd the ryght holy huma¦nyte of Jhesu cryste is of asmoche the more greate as yt / that he hath of hymselfe of ye vyrgyn Mary and all the company of paradyse as ye gyftes and graces of Jhesu cryste exceden y• gyftes & merytes of all ye sauyd / the whiche excesse is infynyte for as moche yt suche a man that is to knowe Jhesu cryst is god egall vnto the fader and vnto the blessyd ho¦ly
goost in all maieste dyuyne and all these compa¦rysons before sayd of ye multyplycacyon of euery of the sauyd they ought to be vnderstonde as vnto the nombre & multytude of ye glorye and not asmo¦che or more parfytly to loue. That is to saye yt eue¦ry sauyd loueth more parfytly his propre & party∣culer glorye than he ne doeth yt of all the sauyd / & so he it ought to do by good charyte ye whiche begȳ¦neth vnto hymselfe but for asmoche yt charyte ma¦keth all thynges to be comon be it good / or yll / eue¦ry of the sauy hath accydentall Joye as well of ye multytude of the sauyd as of theyr merytes and of euery of them inpartyculer more or lesse after ye de∣grees of the glorye yt he seeth and knoweth and lo∣uech in euer of his neyghbours. Who may thynke and nombre this glorye or it fayne to comprayse & to esmeruayll. The thyrde maner of knowlege is that they shall see and knowe clerely all the syn¦nes greate and horryble that they haue commyt∣ted. And also they shall see the cautelles the subty¦lyteesCuimin{us} dimitti¦tur minus diligit. luce. vii. cap̄. and temptacyons deceuables that they ha∣ue escaped / were they of the worlde / or theyr propre sensualyte / or of the deuyll / and of as moche that they ben escaped / the more vyctoryously and from the more stronger bataylle and from more grea∣ter perylles / of as moche knowen they the more ayde and the mercy of god with oute the whiche they hadde hadde full lytell power for to resyste or them to releue after the byenge of the deth for the gylte culpe of synne and as moche as they knowe to haue hadde the more greate grace & ayde of godScim{us} qm̄ diligē∣tib{us} deū oia coope rātur i bonū rom̄. of as moche loue they hym the more & of as moche

The .iiii. maner of knowlege shall be yt they shall se & know the dampned the erroure & the multytude of theyrLetabitur iust{us} cū¦viderit vidictāma¦nus suas lauabit i sanguine pctōrie. {pro}s. lvii.

In ye whiche appereth yt neuer ye dāp¦ned ne cōmytte synne wherof he ne receyueth aug∣mentacyon of the glorye of euery of the sauyd. Al∣so it appereth that in lyke wyle as the augmentaci¦on of the glorye that they seen in y• sauyd / and that they receyuen the one of the other is incompreuable as it is sayd before. In lyke wyse is incompreuable the augmentacyon of the glorye the whiche cometh in the sauyd by the occasyon of the dampned and them seluen for as moche that there aren mo of ye dampned than of the sauyd. Also many the whiche
haue ben other tymes grete synners / as saynt poul saynt Mathewe / and mary Mawdelayn / shall see the grete and horryble tormentes yt they haue Ju∣stly deseruyd. The whiche they haue escaped by ye bonte & mercy of god / wherfore they ben the more embrased & sharpe in the loue of god / & by the con¦sequent it foloweth yt they haue the more grete de∣lectacyon & Joye of asmoche as the loue is ye more grete in lyke wyse as it is sayd. By these thynges before sayd well notyd appereth clerely that all thȳ¦ges ben reduced fynally vnto the glorye of god / for who so refuseth or hym yeldeth indygne of the gra¦ce & mercy of god / falleth & is reducyd vnder the Justyce / & of asmoche is the thynge dygne for to meruayll & for to prayse god in his Justyce infyny¦te as in his mercy / who may it thynke suche infy∣nyte & suche depnes of glorye. THe seconde Joye of the partye of the soule / is parfyte to loue ye whiche procedeth of. iiii thynges. The fyrste is god wherfore it is to be no∣tyd that reason & experyens vnto vs shewen that of as moche that some thynge is of more grete va∣loure / of as moche is it worthy to be the better belo¦ued / and of as moche that it is the better belouyd & desyred it is the more greate Joye for to haue the possessyon and the fruycyon. Now is it soo that in god is all bonte / sapyence / honoure / and noblesse / swetnes Joye and gladnes / and so of other perfec∣cyons infynytes the whiche may be desyred and lo∣ued.
By the whiche it behoueth to saye that all those y• whiche of suche & so grete goodes haue sure possessyon eternall they haue moche more greater Joye of hym / than of ony other thynge / of as mo¦che that god is more greate good than is all other good create. And syns he is all good and welth in fynyte it appereth clerely that he ought to be by lo∣ued infynytly aboue all other goodes the whiche may be spoken or thought. Now is it shewed that of loue cometh Joye and gladnes as grete as the lo¦ue may be. By the whiche it foloweth that the Jo¦ye that these blessyd haue / for the loue that they ha¦ue vnto god / in god / and of god is infynytly in in∣fynyte aboue all other Joyes that they may haue. / of ony other good create by suche maner that suche Joyous pleasurs and gladnesses that euer weren in persone or creature / or myghtebe / ben lesse thyn¦ge vnto the regarde of theym the whiche proceden of the lyuely fountayne of the blessyd Trynyte theme is a drope of water vnto the regarde of all the sees. The seconde thynge the whiche we shol∣de loue after god / that is oure seluen after the or¦denaunce of god and also of nature and of trewe charyte. And therfore for as moche that the sauyd seen that they haue purchased welth infynytly and euerlastynge withoutende / and that they ha∣ue done the thynge by the whiche they ben comen vnto the grace of god / and vnto the glorye of pa∣radyse they hym louen / and the goodes that they haue purchased as moche as they ben / and that
they haue purchased greate welth. For as mo∣che as they haue purchased welth infynyte and euerlastynge / as moche is grete theyr loue in them seluen and of theym seluen. And by the consequent as moche is greate theyr Joye and nombre / thyn¦ke it who that may. The thyrde thynge the whi¦che we sholde loue / that is that we sholde loue our neyghbours and the maner of the loue after god and holy scrypture is as our leluen and of this Jo¦ye it hath bentouched here before in the seconde ar¦tycle of the fyrste Joye. I put that it is another chynge to se and to vnderstonde the welth of hys neyghbour / and another thynge hym to loue / for the one procedeth of the vnderstondynge / and the other of the wyll / but for the comon rule it suffy∣seth as nowe that euery sauyd enioyeth hym of the welth and merytes of his neyghbours of as moche the more that they ben in the more grete nō∣bre and in the more hygh degre of merytes. By ye whiche it bhoueth for to saye that in lyke wyse as the vnderstondynge is full of the knowlege of the grete felycyte and also the beatytude of his neygh¦bours. And in lyke wyse is the wyll full of loue / of the whiche procedeth a Joye and a gladnes as moche greate as may be the knowlege and the lo∣ue. And for as moche that of god aloonly is kno∣wen the nombre of the chosen and the degree of all theyr Joyes and merytes. And also is y• glorye of cuery of them yt he hath vnto the regarde of ye loue of his neyghbour. The fourth thynge that we
sholde loue our owne bodyes / the whiche shall be than clere and shynynge more than the sonne of some moche of other lytell after theyr degre of ye glorye and of the merytes of the soule as it shall be sayd here after and syns it is so y• these worldly people haue pleasur & gladnes to see them clothed and enornyd with precyous clothes as golde & syl∣ke / & of dyuers & of many furres of wylde bestes the whiche abyllymentes may not longe endure wt out gadrynge of wormes and that they ne chaūge colour / what may be the Joye of the blessyd & the shynynge of the rube of inmortalyte y• whiche vnto them shall be gyuen & presentyd by the blessyd The su cryste the kynge of glorye for lyueray. The whi¦che they haue deseruyd in this present worlde / for that / yt they haue subduyd theyr sensualyte for to do penaunce who so may it compas. THe thyrde Joye of the partye of the soule / is to be sure and certayne that the glorye & the blessydnes in the whiche a man hym seeth andSpēs est certa er¦pectacio future be atitudiser dei gr̄a¦et bonis meritis redentibus pue∣niens hee magr̄ sē ēcia{rum}. xx vii. di. iii Penitē a agite ap {pro}piquabit reg∣nū eclo{rum}. mat. iiii.

The whiche promesse is wryten in ma¦ny places of the holy scrypture the whiche may ne¦uer lye / and by the whiche we may knowe some what the grete and mestymable dyfferrence of the poore and deceuable glorye worldly and of that the whiche is the very glorye eternall. For fyrste the glorye the whiche is worldly is in thynges outwar¦de and not alwayes in the soule / for many the whi¦che haue and poede the royalmes of the erth suf∣fren moche of ylles and of thought & of anguys∣shes in theyr conscyences and oftentymes they ben moche myserables and in pryson and bondes of y• enemye of helle by the grete and horryble mortall synnes / but those the whiche haue the glorye of paradyse ben and shall be in all euer gloryous in body and in soule. Also the glorye of the worlde is inperfyte / for he that moost hath the more he de∣fauteth / but that of paradyse is ryght parfyte with¦out ony indygence. Also that of the worlde endu∣reth not longe. Where is nowe the grete and noble kynge▪ Dauyd. Salamn. Arphazat. Ptholomee Naby godonoer. Ader and Charlemayne / & those other grete lnd kynges erthely y• whi∣che haue benlde / greate / gloryous / and puyssauntees and in rychesses / theyr glo∣rye h anone be passed. But so is it not of the glof the blessyd / for there is not so lytell a saynt in paradyse but that he hath more honour of prayse / of glorye / / and of rychesses than there
shall moūte in one man oonly all the glorye thatBeatitudo ē stat{us} om bono{rum} aggre∣gacōe fect{us}. hoe∣cius. euer was and shall be tyll vnto the ende of the worl¦de in all y• lyuers vpon erth. O how moche ought he to haue grete desyre / and grete hope the whiche infynytly is certayne for to come vnto so grete go∣de. The seconde cause of this certaynte / is for as moche as god and nature haue ordeyned that euery thynge the whiche is comen vnto his ende cesse his mouynge in receyuynge the perfeccyon the whiche appertayneth vnto the degre of his nature and of his condycyon. Now is it soo that the esperyte hu∣mayne create so nobly by puyssaunce dyuyne than is in the ende and consūmacyon whan it is vnyed with god as well by grace as by glorye / for in that he hath the accomplysshment of all his desyres & possessyon of goodes infynyte. By the whiche he may neuer other thynge appetyte / but abyde al∣wayes in suche stedfastnes of the beatytude euer∣lastynge. The thyrde cause of certaynte is for by cause of the estate of inmortalyte / For syns that spyryte create hath taken his body / vnto the whi∣che he hath naturall inclynacyon / and that he ha∣the deseruyd in this brefe and mortall lyfe for to come vnto the begynnynge of euery creature the whiche is god / it is Impossyble after the lawes / that haue ben instytute by the sapyence dyuyne vn¦to his creatures but that he abyde in the stedfastnes of the eternall vysyon of the blessyd trynyte. The fourth cause of this sure sted fastnes yf for the valu of the good / vnto the whiche these blessyd ben co∣me / that is god the whiche is the good infynyte. /
And more ouer the whiche is not Impossyble that a man may other thynge loue / but in hym and for hym. By the whiche as well the mynde as the vn∣derstondynge and wyll ben parfytly deyfyed and so there is parfyte certaynte of the beatytude eter∣nall without ony admyxicyon to put in of varya∣blyte / wherfore euery creature sholde take payne for to come vnto suche blessydnes eternall. THe fouth Ioye of the partye of the soule / Inebriabūtur ab vbertatedom tue & torrēte voluptat tue potabis eos. p̄s. xxxv. Osei hoies scire desiderāt. {pro}uerb. xxii. ca. Ead sentē∣cia hētur. i. math. Extrema gaudit luct{us} occupat. qui additsciēciā addit et dolorem. is a meruaylous and a grete exaltacyon & gladnes inuenerable the whiche causeth four thyn∣ges in the soule yblessyd. The fyrste is that by su¦che Ioye all thynges vnto hym ben put in Ioye. /: The seconde is that she fulfylleth and maketh dronke the wyll / for it is a thynge Impossyble but that the wyll of the blessyd be not all holly reple∣nysshed with gladnes. The thyrde is that notwith¦stondynge her excesse and abondaunce she shal not be in ennoye ne in anguysshe / but euer more softe / swete and pleasaunte. The fourth is that she par¦fyteth all the desyre as well of the vnderstondynge as of the wyll the whiche naturally desyren glad∣nesse and comynge. The whiche thynges may not be parfytly founde in this present worlde tran¦sytorye in lyke wyse as it appereth ynough by ex∣peryence / for all the gladnes worldly endeth and taketh his terme in anguysshe and in sorowe and a lyke thynge is it of comynge worldly and erthly the whiche better ought to be called folye than co∣mynge.
THe fyfth Ioye of the partye of the soule / is abondaunce of all goodes the whiche ben yelden them in the soule in foure partes. The fyr∣ste is of god the whiche is fountayne and depnesse of all goodes the whiche may neuer be spoken nor wryten / nor herte humayne ne may it thynke / and therfore he the whiche hath suche perfeccyon of goodes he hath all without that / that it vnto hym may ony thynge defayle / And he that hadde an hondreth thousande worldes and holde be pryue of this In the whiche is suche parfeccyon of godes he myght well saye that he hadde nothynge. The seconde is of hymselfe / for the soule yblessyd her possedeth in god in her souerayne perfeccyon of all his puyssaunces / and of his vertues / and mery∣tes. And therfore it is well sayd that who so put∣teth his herte aboue all in god he hath his herte / & so hath god / and he that it putteth in another pla∣ce he leseth his herte / and so leseth god. The thyr∣de is for the presence of the company as well of y• .ix. ordres of aungelles / as of the patryarches / ap∣postles / martyrs / confessours / and vyrgynes / and for the consummacyon of the charyte the whiche is in paradyse the welth of the one is the welth of the other in lyke wyse as it hath ben before sayd and declared. The fourth is for that that the go∣des before sayd ben all togyders not the one after the other / or the one withoute the other / and the soule chosen in hym and by hym the whiche is al / myghty / is soo vygoryous in all his puyssaunces that she may haue knowlege / loue and also grete
gladnes / as well of god / as of all the creatures / as well in euery of them in partyculer as of all togy∣ders for euery momemt / and for euer without ende By this it appereth that euery true crysten man hȳ sholde enforce to mowe come vnto suche goodes to suffre an hundreth thousande tymes y• deth ryght Ioyously yf it were possyble and god it sholde re∣quyre / but by his mercy he doeth it an hondreth. M tymes better chepe vnto the whiche the poore worl¦dely people haue ryght lytell regarde. THe syxte Ioye of the partye of the soule is honoure incomparable for foure thynges. The fyrste is for his deuocyon / deuocyon is asmo¦che to saye as dedycacyon / or to be ordeyned to ser∣ue god and hym prayse. And for as moche that ye soule yblessyd is ryght parfytly the temple of the blessyd trynyte / she is bayned in the lyght of the lo¦ue infynyte / and embrased with souerayne & ryght parfyte deuocyon. The seconde is for as moche y• she her seeth the doughter of god by true adopcyon and yf lordshyppes erthely and worldly is reputed thynge hygh dygne and honourable / as it sholde be to be the sone of an Erle / of a duke / or of a kyn¦ge / what may a man thynke of that spyrytuall & dyuyne lygnage / who may it thynke. The thyrde foloweth by the seconde / that is that by suche adop¦cyon she her seeth and knoweth the quene of para∣dyse / who may in suche honoure compas and thȳ¦ke / he hath mater ynoughe for to delaye. The
fourth / that is that not aloonly suche is the dough∣terEgo dixi dii estis filu excelsi omnes. s. lxxxi. and quene of paradyse / but with that she is ad¦uowed and reknowleged goddesse by partycypa∣cyon. By the whiche all the courte celestyall vnto her bereth reuerence with gretae honoure and of good ryght syns that god her solmoche honoureth and ryght excellently deyfyeth. THe seuenth Joye of the partye of the soule is beautefull of admyracyon in foure ma∣ners. The fyrste is in beaute of vnderstondynge / the whiche is the clere knowlege of god and also of his creatures / As it hath ben touched here befo∣re. The seconde knowlege is the beaute dyuyne the whiche illumyneth and maketh the soule glo∣ryous for to shyne an hondreth thousande tymes more than ye sonne The thyrde is y• beaute of noble vertues with the whiche the soule is innornyd / as sholde be a ryght ryche vestyment with grete mul¦tytude of golde and of precyous stones the whiche hath ben sette by a werkeman souerayne in shy∣nynge varyacyon of dyuers colours / for he the whi¦che hath innornyd the heuen with dyuerse bodyes shynynge and the erth with the erbes and the trees beynge grene / and the see and the ayre with fys∣shes and foules fleynge / floures and feders so dy∣uersely paynted and fygured that souerayne werke man hath inestymable paynted / and ennornyd his doughter / his loue / and his espouse / his trone and his reclynatorye. That is to vnderstonde the soule
gloryous and blessyd. The fourth is the compa∣ryson of ye foure vertues cardynales ye whiche than shall be in theyr souerayne operacyon. That is to vnderstonde / Justyce / force / prudence / and attem∣peraunce / shall holde the soule without ony resys∣tence in her operacyons agayne god / and agayne euery creature / for by the vertue of force the soule is vnyed with god / by Justyce she is subiecte vnto god / by prudence she cheseth to see god aboue all thynges / by attemperaunce she is not subiecte nor letted by ony mouynge of passyon the contrarye / yt is beaute and ordenaunce spyrytuall ne may not be shewed vnto vnderstondynge humayne for this presentlyfe but ryght lytell in comparyson of the trouth. THe eyght Joye of the partye of the soule is for the eternyte of her glorye the whiche is greate and incompreuable for foure thynges. The fyrste is for the presence and conformyte that she hath with god. The seconde for the company and amyable charyte that she hath with the aungelles and the aungelles with her. The thyrde for the vnyon and Joyous consyderacyon of her wyll wt the sayntes of paradyse / and all the sayntes with her. The fourth for the tranquylyte that she hath in herselfe by that / that she shall be sure and con∣fermed in the eternyte of her glorye and blessydnes and for as moche that all these thynges the which haue ben touched here before / it is not necessarye to prolonge this artycle.
THe nynth Joye of the partye of the soule isCredētes autē ex uavi leticia in narrabili & glorifi catareportates fi¦ē fideivē salutē aia{rum}. v. i{rum}. i. pe. i. c Aug. xxii. de ci. dei refeccyon ryght delectable for foure thyn∣ges. The fyrste is for as moche that than the spy¦ryte humayne is the souerayne consūmacyon of al perfeccyon of all delectacyon / and of all his desy∣res / and so is come vnto that / that he hadde before byleued and hoped / and vnto that vnto the whiche she neuer rechyd nor ouer come. The seconde for as moche that all payne / all labour / all thought / fynysshedDe ē ims deside∣rin{rum} t̄o{rum}  sine fi¦ne videbt̄. sie fasti dio amavit̄ sine fa tigaciōe laudabt̄. in this worlde hath no tryenge or reste but in glorye there is no thought / laboure / nor dys¦maye / but all to the contrary. That is to vnder∣stonde / peas / Joye / and consolacyon. The thyrde for that that the company is ryght delectable / As some what it appereth in persone of grete honoure fre and lyberall vnto whome it suffyseth not to ha¦ue in his hous aboūdantes and delycyous meetesO israel {quam} magna ē dom{us} dei & ingēs loc{us} possessiois ei{us} aruth. tercio. cap̄ yf he haue not company lyke. In lyke wyse is it of the soule yblessyd the whiche hath the kynge Jhe¦sus / and the quene the moder of god and the mu∣syque and melodye angelyque and all the prynces dukes / Countes / and barons / esquyres / ladyes / gē¦tylwomen without nombre the whiche all theym delyten ryghte Joyously in the beaute and in the noble vertues and merytes of the soule yblessyd. /: The fourth for that that the palays where suche feste is songen and suche dyner is inestymable gre¦te / pleasaunt / and ennornyd the whiche is the pro∣pre herytage of the soule gloryfyed after as holy / scrypture sayth. And yf it be so that in this lyfe mortall a man hath Joye / lotes and pryse for the (proprete or
possyon of a royalme or of a duchye what may her¦te humayne ymagen of the glorye the whiche ap∣perteyneth vnto the soule to haue the conquest of suche herytage. THe. x. Joye of the partye of the soule is bles¦sydnes without ony varyacyon or diminu∣cyon or imperfeccyon the whiche ben foūde in worl¦dely glorye. The fyrst admixcion of some thought for there was neuer soo gloryous a man erthely & worldely but that hath some defaute. Many be ry∣che the whiche haue no helth / these other ryche & in helth the whiche haue not beaute or they be not of all folke byloued / these other ryche hole & fayre but they haue not all that yt theyr herte desyreth / but in the glorye of paradyse there ne is defaute diminu∣cyon of beaute / of rychesse / of pleasure / of charyte / The seconde imperfeccyon of glorye worldely is aHō nat{us} de mulie∣re breu viuēs te repiet̄ multis me∣seriis. Job. xiii. maner of anoysaunce / for in wyne or in meete / in carnall delyte / in dysporte / in rychesses / or in what some euer other thynge that he may desyre comen fynally to anoysaūce & hath ben the lesse praysed / but in the delytes of paradyse is neuer foūde ony varyacyon / alwayes in loue without tydynges / al∣wayes begynneth euer more beloued / euer more de∣lectablesBreues dies hois sunt. Job. xiii. & pleasaūtes. The thyrde inperfeccyon of glorye worldely is that it may not endure / for lyf humayne & temporall is compared vnto a wynde / vnto the smoke / or the arowe the whiche is depar∣ted & shote with the bowe the whiche hath noo ta∣ryenge tyll vnto that yt she is in the marke aduysed and determyned of hym the whiche it shoteth / but
sensualyte / for that that it is submytte vnto the spi¦ryte after the ordre of reason. And therfore all the glorye of the body cometh of god by the meane of the soule. In lyke wyse as dampnacyon cometh vn to the soule by the meane of the body / & in suche wyse appyred the ordre of this treatyse & the an∣swere vnto the questyon. And therfore of the glo∣rye of the body & of his douers is now to treate fyr¦ste in generall & afterwarde more in especyall. As vnto the fyrste it is to vnderstande that the body gloryous hath foure pryncypales excellences that these theologyens callen the douers of the body / that is to knowe clerenes ryght delectable / impas∣sybylyte in enarrable / subtylyte inestymable / and agylyte incomparable. Also after saynt Ancelme / beaute / force / lyberte / helth / all other delytes & plea¦sures that may be spoken & ymagyned in regarde of the operacyon of the fyue wyttes of nature & of the place & of all other circonstaūces in lyke wyse as it appyred here after shall be in all the bodyes of the saued & in so ryght grete & inestymable ex∣cellence that ony tonge mortall is not suffycyent for to speke it / but for as moche as god excused the fragylyte humayne the whiche dooth that that in hym is / here foloweth in partyculer the .x. pryncy¦pall Joyes the whiche ben in euery body vnyed wt the soule gloryous. ¶ Here folowen the .x. Joyes of ye partye of ye body. The fyrste of the body excellent clerenes. The seconde perfecte inpassybylyte.
The thyrde subtylyte meruayllous. The fourth agylyte incompreuable. The fyfth celestyall habytacyon. The sixte moche delectable vysyon. The seuenth melodye ryght agreable. The eyght prayenge inestymable. The nyneth sauour and pleasaunt tastynge. The tenth the prayse of voyces wtout essynge. THe fyrste Joye of the partye of the body is clerenes the whiche may be compared vnto foure thynges. The fyrst is vnto the soule / for as moche that the soule shall be more dygne / more noble / & of more greter degree of meryte of as mo¦che vnto hym shall be yelden his body the more shynynge in the douaire of the clerenes of glorye / As for example. Who so taketh a lyght grete or ly tell & it sholde put in a lampe / or in another vessell of glasse / of as moche as the lyght sholde be theBenedicamus pa¦trē & filiū cū ō spi¦ritu laudem{us} & su∣{per}exaltem{us} ū in se¦cula. Dan̄. iii. more grete / the sayd glasse sholde be the more shy∣nynge. The seconde comparyson is vnto dyuerse partyes of the body / for a man ought not ymagen that the eyes & the face of the body gloryous aren in ony degree more clere and more shynynge than shall be the foot or the legge. The thyrde compa∣ryson is vnto these other bodyes gloryous / for in lyke wyse as we see yt the sonne & the mone & all ye sterres of ye skye haue one suche dyfference in theyr clerenes yt tweyne may not be foūde in all sembla∣bles / a lyke thynge is it of the bodyes of ye blessyd. The fourth comparyson of the good werkes done durynge the vnyon of the body and of the soule in
this mortall lyf / for the blessyd haue glorye & pray¦se of all the good werkes yt they euer dyde in this worlde for the loue of god weren they in the estate of grace or in mortall synne / how be it that in that there is grete dyfference in lyke wyse as it hath ben sayd before. By the whiche it appyred that a man may desyre to lyue longely for to amende his lyf / & for to excercyse hym in his good werkes / of the whiche a man may haue Joye & prayse without ende. The prayse of the good dedes done in the e∣state of mortall synne is a Joye accydentale the whiche cometh as well vnto the body as vnto the soule for as moche that they haue in some wyse di∣sposicyon & preparacyon to retorne vnto the estate of grace. Of that sayth Alexander of hales in his summe that the good werkes may be suche that durynge the tyme that a man is occupyed in them a man taryeth as for ony successyon of tyme the mortall synne is not aggrauate durynge the occu∣pacyon of those good werkes. Also saynt Bernar∣dyne in his treatyse de contractibus in the sermon lxiiij. the whiche thus begynneth. Ecce ego vobiscū¦sum &. recyteth twelue other prouffytes the whiche comen of good werkes done in mortall synne. Fyr¦ste they defenden the persone from some synnes in the whiche he sholde falle yf were not those good werkes. Also they dysposen the soule vnto other or semblables good werkes. Also they contynue the soule in lyf mortall & vertuous. Also those the whi¦che done theyr penaunce in suche estate of synne ben acquyte. Also they occupye the tyme in suche wyse that without those good werkes a man shol∣de
falle in to ydlenes or in to more grete ylle. Also they make the persone partener in the good dedes of his neyghbour. Also they letten many grete los∣ses & cursyd aduentures the whiche these synners haue deserued & augmenten the goodes temporels as ben helth of body / rychesse of golde & syluer / & of other possessyons / for the whiche goodes they shall haue honoure & glorye yf they ben one tyme sauyd. Also they letten the puyssaūce of theyr goo∣stly enemye the whiche had ye more grete occasyon to make th synner to falle in to temptacyon yf were not those good werkes. Also a man is not so moche punysshed in helle or in purgatorye as yf a man had ben ydell or occupyed in euyll werkes in the tyme that a man hath done those good dedes. Also they prouoken the bonte of the creatoure for to gyue grace vnto the synner to reknowlege his gylte & for to fynde mercy. By the whiche it beho∣ueth to saye that the body & the soule of the saued haue glorye accydentale for suche werkes how be it that they haue ben done in the estate of mortall synne. THe seconde Joye of the partye of the body is perfecte impassybylyte for foure thyn∣ges. The fyrst for he may not haue thynge in this worlde that vnto hym may be contraryous / be it withoutforth or within. The seconde for as moche as the body hath other tymes endured in as moche as mortall & passyble of as moche shall he be in the more hygh degree of Impassybylyte as before hath ben sayd that some shall be more clere than
other. The thyrde for as moche that all the par∣tyes of the body shall be egall in suche maner that yf he were in the fyre of helle where an hondred thousande glauyes ryght sharpe stryken agayne hym where he myght not in ony wyse suffre them. The fourth for as moche as the contemperacyon of the foure elementes of the whiche the body hu∣mayne is composed ben in theyr souerayne & ryght perfecte consūmacyon by ye whiche may neuer fall passyon / corrupcyon / ne alteracyon / & in suche wy∣se they abyden impassybles eternally. THe thyrde Joye of the partye of the body is subtylyte in foure maners. The fyrste / for suche body gloryous may be wt & wtin an other bo∣dy not gloryous in lyke wyse as the fyre the whiche is a thynge corporell may be by the waye of nature wtout & wtin in all the partyes of an yren on fyre & therfore yf by waye naturell suche penytracyon is done in a body not gloryous / it ought not to be ryght grete meruaylle yf it be done by puyssaunce dyuyne in the bodyes the whiche ben gloryfyed. The seconde for the body gloryous shall not beHec dicit thomas anglici in suo. iiii. with the body gloryous / for two bodyes gloryous for to be togydres repugne of good congruyte and vnto the ordre that the sapyence inyfynyte hath put in thynges treate. The thyrde / for the body gloryous shall be egally subtyle in all partes the whiche ought to be vnderstande as to thynke on an other body not gloryous / for the eye shall not fynde more of resystence than the fote or the hande & in lyke wyse of other membres / but neuerthelesse
the one membre shall be more subtyle or lesse after as it apperteyned vnto the disposicyon of the body humayne. The fourth is the body gloryous shall be & abyde in that degree of subtylte ye he hath de∣serued for euer wtout fyndynge ende & wtout fyndȳ¦ge resystence the whiche maketh lettynge vnto the wyll of ye soule but yt the body gloryous may be in a moment from ye heuen in the erthe & from ye erth in heuen / & from the one parte of heuen in ye other in lesse space of tyme than now it may be spoken vnderstande / or thought. THe fourth Joye of the partye of the body is agylyte in foure maners. The fyrst / for th body gloryous shall be aboue all obeyssaūce vnto the wyll of ye soule / & shall not lette it in no mane but yt she be incōtynent from one place in to an o∣therAug{us} xxii. de ci.  vbi volet spūs ibi protinus erit. as may be now our thought as soone ferre as nere. The seconde / for the body gloryous shall not haue more of disposicōn to descende than to ascen∣de / but all his propre inclynacyon shall be obeyed vnto the puyssaūce & wyll of the soule the whiche suche glorye vnto her hath pryncypally purchased in obeyenge vnto the creatoure. The thyrde for as moche as the body gloryous is not borne from one place in to an other for necessyte or indygence as we see in this worlde / but all oonly for the pleasu∣re & glorye of the soule / and therfore in no thynge that may be ymagyned the body gloryous ought not to lette or tarye the soule. The fourth for as moche as the body gloryous may not alonge hym from the presence of god / for in what soeuer place
that the body and the soule gloryous be borne al∣wayesIn ipso viuimus, mouemur & sum{us} eccle. xvii. they ben present & haue the clere vysyon of god. And so it appyred shortely of the foure douai∣res of the body that is claryte / impassybylyte / sub∣tylyte / & agylyte / the whiche ben of the hygh perfec¦cyonCorpus quod cor¦rumpit̄ aggrauat animam. that is in the leste of the gloryous that is or the whiche fynally shall be in glorye with ye blessyd that none entendement with holden & aggreued in body mortall ne may it comprehende / but euery creature in his owne ryght ought faythfully to la∣bour to the entent that he may fynally haue the experyence of suche meruaylle. THe fyfth Joye of the partye of the body is by cause of the habytacyon of y• heuen em∣peryall for foure thynges. That is to vnderstande for the beaute / for ye force & for the resonaūce. The beaute of heuen is suche & so grete that it may not be compared vnto no beaute erthely. The gretnes of the erthe is also as nothynge in regarde of the gretnes of heuen / force / Joye / & gladnes there pro∣ceden & habonden in all partyes in suche maner yt the fyue wyttes gloryous ben soueraynly replenys∣shed euery of them that that he appetyteth / that isCātate dn̄o canti∣cū nouū. p̄s. c. l.

The seconde for the presence of the gloryous quene the moder of god. The thyr¦de is in seenge the grete & innumerable company of the blessyd. The fourth is for the clerenes of the glorye the whiche is the shynynge of all sayntes assembled in one lyght. Thynke he yt may what
thynge it may be to see these thynges beforesayd / for no wrytynge ne may suffyse for to declare the one of them all oonly as it is / also that the clere∣nes of the lest body gloryous the whiche is or shall be fynally in paradyse shall be greter / than shall be the clerenes of the sonne yf she were. xiiij. ty∣mes more grete than she is now ones. O hertes humayns thynke than what may be ye clerenes of the precyous & ryght gloryous body of Ihesu cryste & of his blyssd & ryght dygne moder & also of o∣ther euery of them in his degree. But what may yt be of all togyder but oonly one depnes of Joye & of gladnes as moche grete as is yt lyght. And this is as vnto the fyfth Joye of the body. THe herynge shall be full of Joye & gladnes for foure thynges. The fyrst shall be for ye melody of ye voyce the whiche is & shall be herde in the glorye celestyall. The seconde for ye grete nom∣bre of them the whiche maken & gyuen suche me∣lodye / for there ben men & women / angelles & ar∣changelles in one accorde of dyuyne and celestyall musyke. The thyrde for by cause that the songe be foresayd prodeth of loue & of Joye infynyte. The fourth for the reason of hym vnto whome is ma∣de suche Joyous melodye / that is vnto all the bles∣syd trynyte the whiche gyueth so moche of good∣nes & so moche of honoure vnto all the company of the saued the whiche neuer may cesse to mag∣nyfye god and hym to prayse without noysaunce or beynge wery. And this is for the sixte Joye of the partye of the body.
