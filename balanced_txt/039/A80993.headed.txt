A PROCLAMATION Of His HIGHNESS (by and with the Advice of His Council) for putting in Execution the Laws against Transportation of Woolls, Wool-fels, Fullers-Earth, and other things. WHereas several Complaints have been made unto His Highness, That great quantities of Woolls, Wool-fels, and Fullers-Earth, are daily transported out of the Dominions of this Commonwealth into the Parts beyond the Seas, notwithstanding the many good and whole∣some Laws and Statutes heretofore made and provided (and yet it force) against the same, to the great inhauncing of the Rates and Prices of those Commodities, and the apparent hurt, detriment and prejudice of the State: And His Highness having taken the same into due con∣sideration, and (with the advice of His Council) weighing the evil consequences thereof, both to the Manufactures of this Nation; And also considering the prejudice that may happen to the Commonwealth in general, if some timely course be not taken for preventing the same: And whereas by several Acts, Statutes and Ordinances heretofore made, the transporting the same is prohibited under sundry great and severe penalties; and to the intent none may pretend ignorance of the same, as also to quicken His Highness Officers and Ministers, and others, to whom the excution of those Laws, so advantagious and necessary to the Publique, is intrusted, to do their duties therein, His Highness (by and with the advice of His Council) hath thought fit to publish this His Proclamation, letting all the People of this Commonwealth know, That His Highness shall expect and require a due and exact obedience to the Laws in that behalf made: And His Highness likewise signi∣fies His pleasure, That he intends a full and effectual prosecution against all offenders and transgressors against the said Laws, and that the utmost rigour and extremity thereof shall be required, without any hope of mitiga∣tion or moderation: And if any extremity shall happen to any one therein, his Highness shall account it Iustice,

And it is by the said Ordinance further Ordained, That if any Merchant, or any other person or persons should transport, or cause to be transported any of the said Earth or Clay, Wooll, Woollen-yarn, or Woollen Flox, or Wool-fells, contrary to the intent of the said Ordinance, That then he should be disabled for requiring any Debt or Accompt of any Fa∣ctor or others, for or concerning any Debt of Estate, properly belonging to such Merchant and Offender, to his own use. And that if any owner of the land where such Clay or Earth should be digged or gotten, should be privy unto, or know of such Transportation by any person or persons, and should not discover the same to some Iustice or Iusti∣ces of the Peace, within three moneths of such his knowledge, he should for every such offence forfeit Five hun∣dred pounds of lawful Money of England: And that if such Iustice of Peace to whom such discovery should be made, should not certifie the same under his Hand and Seal to the Barons of the Exchequer, or one of them, with∣in three Moneths following, he should for every such offence forfeit One hundred pounds of like lawful Money.
