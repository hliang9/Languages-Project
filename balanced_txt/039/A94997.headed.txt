A true copy of a Letter from divers Ministers about Colchester in the County of ESSEX, To the Assembly of Divines, against a TOLERATION. Reverend and Beloved Brethren, THe glory of God, the sense of the Churches miseries, the re∣membrance of our holy Covenant, the discharge of our con∣sciences to God, this present Age and future generations, have caused us in these few Lines to contend and witnesse together with our Brethren, against a Toleration of Independency, so much pleaded for, so much endeavoured; which sad Experience teacheth us for the present, and right Reason convinceth us, will prove for the fu∣ture, the Mother of Contention, the Root of Schism, the Back-door to Heresie, the Nullity of Church-government, the plain Breach of Co∣venant with God and Man, the very undoing of our several Congre∣gations and Ministeries, destructive to the peace and union of the King∣doms, and full of Scandal, if not dangerous to the other Reformed Churches. VVe further conceive in all humility, the several Reasons proposed by our dear Brethren of London in their affectionate Letter, to be so important and rational, that we subscribe unto them with our hearts, as to this also with our hands, with all due acknowledgement of your great zeal and patience in the Lords work. Our hearts are in∣gaged with you, our tears and prayers are for you, that a blessed Reformation may be endeavoured against an intolerable Toleration, remaining Your most affectionate Brethren in the Lord. From Colchester and the parts adjacent, Febr. 11. 1645. Subscribed with Seventy three hands. Printed at London by John Field. March 7. 1645.
