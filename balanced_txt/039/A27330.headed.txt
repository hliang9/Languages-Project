Two Congratulatory POEMS TO THEIR Most Sacred Majesties. THE FIRST, Occasioned on the Universal Hopes of all Loyal Persons for a PRINCE of WALES. THE SECOND, On the Happy BIRTH of the PRINCE. By Mrs. A. BEHN. The Second Edition. LONDON, Printed for Will. Canning, at his Shop in the Temple-Cloysters. 1688.
A CONGRATULATORY POEM TO HER MOST Sacred Majesty, &c. THE Mighty BLESSING is at last arriv'd; Heav'n has, at last, the Wond'rous WORK atchiev'd. Long did th' ALMIGHTY pause, and long debate; For MONARCHS are not fashion'd at a Heat.
So the first Nations, that were bless'd by Heaven, Had the Eternal WORD by Promise given. The Faithful did the Coming GOD believe, And ev'n that Faith alone had Pow'r to save. If Gods we may with Humane Things compare, (For Gods and Kings ally'd most nearly are) This is the Second Birth the World e'er knew, So long Expected, so much Wanted too. Like the first sacred Infant, this will come With Promise laden from the Blessed Womb, To call the wand'ring, scatter'd Nations home. Adoring PRINCES shall arrive from far, Inform'd by ANGELS, guided by his Star, The New-born Wonder to behold, and greet; And Kings shall offer Incense at his Feet.
Hail, Royal BOY! whose Coming is design'd To calm the Murmurs of all Humane Kind. On thy great Birth, Depending- Monarchs wait: From thee the Vniverse expects its Fate. This glorious PROSPECT, like the sacred Law, Stints factious Crouds, and keeps the World in awe; Breaks their consulted Measures, and o'erthrows All the Designs aspiring STATES propose; Arrests the Wheel, in spight of Fortune's Hand, And leaves the World's vast Bus'ness at a Stand. And you, bless'd QVEEN, to whom ALL HAIL belongs From Angels, rather than from Mortal Tongues; Whose Charms of Beauty, Wit and Vertue join'd To chuse you Second Bless'd of Woman-kind.
ALL HAIL,— O Sacred VESSEL, fraught with England's STORE; (A PRIZE more valu'd, ATLAS never bore;) Guard safe our TREASVRE to the wish'd for Shore. And you, Immortal Pow'rs, who have begun Your Noblest FABRICK; let your WORK go on: The Royal YOVTH with all those Charms adorn, The World adores in his bright MOTHER'S Form: His Soul, by his Illustrious SIRES, compleat: All Hero, all Resolv'd, Divinely Great. Where are ye, O ye once officious NINE, That on a Theam so glorious, and sublime, Your Voices are not turn'd to noblest Song? But, Oh! your Lutes are on the Willows hung: Your lov'd BRITANIA listens now no more; MARS frights her from the soft Castalian Shore;
Upon whose Banks, beneath your Shades, each Day, The ravish'd Nymph, charm'd with your Numbers, lay. But from your Groves the fickle Maid is gone. And all your boasted Harmony's undone. But once more tune your Lutes and Voices high; Your tenderest Strains, and noblest Numbers try: Raise those dejected Eyes, in Sorrow dress'd, And view the PROSPECT of the dawning East. A young APOLLO, rising from the Gloom, Dress'd in his Father's brightest Rays, shall come; (Dispersing all the baneful Mists of Night) And bless the Earth with New-created LIGHT; Make all the Face of Nature sweet and gay, Revive her Birth, and triumph o'er the Day. Beneath his Feet Eternal Spring shall spread, And blossom from the Lustre round his Head.
He the faint Muses shall a-new inspire, And from his Beams, kindle their useful Fire: His Right Hand Crowns, his Left shall Lawrels give; And POETS shall by Patron-PRINCES live: On all shall scatter Plenty, Joy and Peace, Unite the World, and make Dissention cease. And you, Dread Monarch! ne'er to be confin'd In any glorious Act you have design'd; Who, like wise Heaven, need but decree alone, And with the Thought, the mighty Task is done: Who for a stubborn Nation's Glory toil, And court her to be Great against her Will. When you esteem'd her worth your Royal Care, You gave her this last Blessing, of an HEIR. O happy KING! to whom a Son is born! What more can Fortune, Heaven, and You perform?
Behold, with Joy three prostrate Nations come: ALBION, HIBERNIA and old CALEDON Now join their Int'rests, and no more dispute, With sawcy Murmurs, who is Absolute; Since, from the Wonders of your Life, 'tis plain, You will, you shall, and must for ever Reign. FINIS.
A Congratulatory POEM TO THE King's Most Sacred Majesty, ON THE HAPPY BIRTH OF THE PRINCE of WALES. By Mrs. A. BEHN. The Second Edition. LONDON, Printed for Will. Canning, at his Shop in the Temple-Cloysters. 1688.
A CONGRATULATORY POEM TO THE King's Most Sacred Majesty, &c. JOY to the Greatest MONARCH of the Earth! As many Joys as this Illustrious BIRTH Has Elevated Hearts! As Endless too, As are the VOWS we Offer up for You. " Oh Happy KING! to whom a SON is Born! " What more cou'd Heaven for this B ss'd Land perform?
Long with Prophetick Fire, Resolv'd and Bold, Your Glorious FATE and FORTVNE I foretold. I saw the Stars that did attend Your REIGN, And how they Triumph'd o'er Great Charles's Wain. Far off I saw this HAPPY DAY Appear; This Jubilee, not known this Fifty Year. This Day fore told, (Great SIR!) that gives you more▪ Than even Your Glorious Virtues did before. No MONARCH's Birth was ever Usher'd in With Signs so Fortunate as this has been. TheTrinity Snnday. Holy Trinity his BIRTH-DAY claims, Who to the World their best Lov'd Blessing sends. Guarded he comes, in Triumph over FATE, And all the Shining HOST around him wait. Angels and Saints, that do his Train Adorn, In Hallelujahs Sing, A KING IS BORN! BlestSt. Mar∣garet's Day. MARGARET, Scotlands Royal Saint and Queen, The last Great Branch of all the Saxon Line,
Waits on this HAPPY BIRTH; and does Declare He, in her Right to Saxons, is the HEIR. n the Fam'd Room, by happy Fate brought forth, WhereCharles II. James II. Two Illustrious KINGS receiv'd their Birth. The LESSONS for This Day, by Chance Divine,The Mor∣ning Les∣son for the Day. Appear'd as they were Order'd by Design. The First, the Holy PROPHET did Unfold When he the Birth of the MESSIAH told. The Words are These;Matth. 3. 12. His Fan is in his Hand, And he shall throughly purge the Floor or Land, Gathering the Wheat into the Granary: Then all One FAITH, at least One SOVL shall be. " The ANGEL next the PATRIARCH did Inform,The Even∣ing Lesson, Gen. 18. 10. " That ISAAC, Chosen ISAAC, shou'd be Born. ASTROLOGERS Divine! that when the Sun Is Mounted to his Full Meridian,
'Tis Lucky to be Born; and does Portend Long Life, that can by no Misfortune end. This, in its Summer-Solstice views the Light, Breaks out, and makes our Longest Day more Bright. Methinks I hear the Belgick LION Roar, And Lash his Angry Tail against the Shoar. Inrag'd to hear a PRINCE OF WALES is Born: Whose BROWS his Boasted Laurels shall Adorn. Whose Angel FACE already does express His Foreign CONQVESTS, and Domestick PEACE. While in his Awful little EYES we Fin'd He's of the Brave, and the Forgiving KIND. All Joy Great QVEEN!—if to your Happy Store Our Grateful Pray'rs, and Wishes can add more. Your Blest DELIV'RANCE to Congratulate, The Adoring World is Prostrate at your Feet. Where TEARS of Joy, and Humble VERSE I lay Too mean a Trophy for this GLORIOVS DAY:
Inspir'd by Nothing but Prophetick Truth, They Boast no other Fire, no other Worth. Full of the JOY, no LINES Correct can write, My Pleasure's too Extream for Thought or Wit. Charm'd to Excess, alas! I strive in Vain, In Scanty VERSE my Transports to Explain Too Vast for Narrow NVMBERS to Contain. FINIS. On Wednesday next will be Published the most Ingenious, and long Expected History of Oroonoko: or, the Royal Slave. By Mrs. Behn.
