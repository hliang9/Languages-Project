WHere it is so that euery creature by the suffraunce of our lorde god is borne and ordeyned to be subgecte & thrall vnto ye stromes of fortune. And so in dyuerse & many sondry wyses man is plexed wt worldely aduersytees. Of the whiche I Anthonie wyde wylle Erle Ryuers sord Scales &c. Haue large¦ly & in many dyfferent maners haue had my parte & of them reueled by thenfinite grace & goodnes of our sayd lord thrugh ye mieane of ye medyatryce of mercy. Whiche grace euydently to me knowen & vnderstonde hath cōpelled me to sette apart all ingratytude. And drone me by reason & {con}scyence as fer as my wretched∣nes wolde suffyse to gyue therfore singuler loues and thākes & exorted me to dispose me recouerd lyfe to his seruyce in folowynge his lawes & cōmaūdementes & in satsfacyon & recōpēse of myn iniquytees & fawtes before done to seke & execute the werkes that myght be moost acceptable to hym & as fer as my fraylnes wolde suffre me I rested in that wyll & purpose. Du∣rynge that season I vnderstode the Iubyle & pardon to be atte the holy opostle saynt Iames in Spayne / whiche was the yere of grace .M.CCCC.lxxiij. Than I detremyned me to take that vyage & shyp∣ped from Southampton in the mometh of Iully the sayd yere / & so sayled from thens tyll I came in to the Spaynysshe see / there lackynye syght of all londes ye wynde beynge good & the wedder fayre. Thā for a re¦creacyon & passynge of tyme I had delyte and arte to rede some good hystorye / & amonge other there was that season in my company a worshypfull gentylman called Lowys de Bretaylles / whiche gretly delyted
hym in all vertuouse and honest thynges that sayde to me / he had there a boke that he trusted I sholde ly∣ke it ryght wel & brought it to me whiche boke I had neuer seen before & is called the saynges or dyctes of the philosophers. And as I vnderstande it was trās∣lated out of latyn in to frenishe by a worshypfull man called messyre Iehan destouteuille prouost of Parys whan I had redde and loked vpon it as I had tyme and space I gaue therto a very affeccyon yt in especy∣all be cause of the holsom & swete sayenges of the pay∣nes whiche is a gloryous fayre myrrour to all good crysten people to beholde and vnderstande ouer that a grete comforte to euery well dysposed soule. It spe∣keth also vnyuersally to example well and doctryne of all knyges / prynces and to people of euery estate. It laudes vertu and scyence. It blames vyces and igno¦raunce. And all be it I coude not at that season nor in all ye pylgremage tyme haue leyser to ouerse it well at my pleasure what for the disposycyon that be lon∣geth to a taker of the Iubylee & pardon. And also for the grete acqueyntaunce that I founde there of wor∣shypfull folkes. With whom it was syttynge I sholde kepe good and honest company / yet neuertheles it re∣sted styll in the desyrous fauour of my mynde enten∣dynge vetterly to take there with grete acqueyntaūce at some other conuenyent tyme. And so remanynge in that opinyon after suche season as it lysted the kyn∣ges grace commaunde me to gyue myn attendaunce vpon my lorde the prynce / and that I was in his ser∣uyce whan I had leyser I loked vpon the sayd boke At the laste concluded in my selfe to translate it in to the Englysshe tonge whiche in my Iugement was
not before. Thynkynge also full necessary to my sayd lorde the vnderstandynge therof / & leste I coude not at all tymes be so well occupyed or sholde fall in ydel∣nes / whan I myght now and than fell in hande wt all drewe both the sentence & the wordes as nyght as I coude. Neuertheles I haue seen and harde of other of the same bokes whiche dyfference & be of other ym¦portaunce / & therfore I drede that suche as sholde ly∣ste to rede the translacyon and haue very intellygen∣ce of ony of those bokes eyther in latyn or in frensshe sholde fynde errours in my werke / whiche I wolde not afferme by cause of the cōtrary / but alledge ye de∣faute to myn vnconnynge wt dyuersytees of the bokes humbly desyrynge the reformacyon therof with mȳ excuse / and the rather syn after my rudenes not expert in my maner folowed my copye and the groūd I had de to spoke vpon as here after ensiewys?
Sedechias SEdechias was the fyrst phylo∣sopher by whō thrught ye wyll and pleaser of our lorde god sapyence was vnderstande and lawes receyued. Whi∣che Sedechias sayde that euery creature of good by∣leue ought to haue in hym syxtē vertues. ¶ The fyrst vertue is to drede & knowe god & his aūgelles. ¶ The seconde vertue is to haue di¦screcyon to dyscerne ye good from the badde & to vse vertues & fle vyces. ¶ The thyrde vertues is to obeye ye kynges or prynces yt god hath ordeyned to reygne vpon hym & that haue lorde shyp and power vpon the people. The fourth vetue is to worshyp his fader & his moder. ¶ The fyfth ver∣tue is to do Iustely and truely to euery creature after his possibylyte. ¶ The sixthe vertue is to dystrybute his almes to ye poore people. ¶ The seuenthe vertue is to kepe & defende straungers & pylgrymes. ¶ The eyght vertue is to bynde & determyne hymselfe to ser∣ue our lorde god. ¶ The nynthe vertue is to eschewe fornycacion. ¶ The tenthe vertue is to haue pacyence ¶ The enleuenth vertue is to be stedfaste and true. ¶ The twelfthe is to be peasyble and attemperate & shamefast of synne. ¶ The thyrtenthe vertue is to lo∣ue Iustyce. ¶ The fourtenthe v{er}tue is to be lyberall &
not couetous. ¶ The fyftenthe vertue is to offre sa∣cryfyces to our lorde god almyghty for the benefyces & graces that he sheweth hym dayly. ¶ And syxten∣the vertue is to worshyp god almyghty and to put to hym holy in his proteccyon and defence for resistan̄ce of the infortunytes that dayly falles in this worlde ¶ The sayd Sedechias sayd that ryght as it apper∣teyneth to the people to be subgect & obeyssaunt to the royall maieste of theyr kynge or prynce ryght so it be houeth theyr kynge or prynce to entende dylygently to the wele and gouernaunce of his people / and rather to wyll the wele of them than his owne propre lucre for by simylytude ryght so is the kynge or the prynce with his people as the soule with ye body. ¶ And sayd yf a kynge or a prynce enforce hymselfe to gadre mo∣ney or tresor by subtyll exortacyon or other vndue mea¦nes he ought to knowe he dooth amys. For suche tre∣sor may not be gadred wtout the sequele be to his daun¦ger or depopulacyon of his realme or countre / & sayd Sedechias yf a kynge or a prynce be neclygēt & slouth¦full and take no hede to serche and enquyre the dispo∣syon & werkes of his enemyes thentent wyll and dede of his subgectes he shall not longe be in surete in his realme. ¶ And sayd the people is fortunate & happy that haue a good and a vertuous kynge or prynce dis∣crete and wyse in scyences. And moche are the people infortunate whanne ony of these thynges lacke in theyr kynge or prynce. ¶ And sayde yf a kynge or a prynce for slouth leue to do ony of lytel thynges yt hym ought & is ordeyned he sholde execute lyghtely after
he leueth gretter vndone and so consequently he may lese all ryght / as a lytell sekenesse or hurt without it be sone & well remedyed may cause the destruccyon of all the holy body. ¶ And sayd yf a kynge or a prynce byleue the fayre wordes and flatterynge of his ene∣myes hauynge no respecte to theyr werkes it is mer∣uayle but the sayd kynge or prynce therby sodaynly take harme. ¶ And sayde it aperteyneth to a kynge or a prynce to enforme his sone in vertue and scyence howe he shall gouerne his lande after hym howe he sholde be ryght wys to his people / howe he sholde lo∣ue & haunte his knyghtes not sufferynge them to vse to moche huntynge nor other ydelnes / but instructe them to haue good eloquence and to eschewe all vany∣tees. ¶ And sayd it appertyneth to a kynge or to a prynce. Yf he wyll haue ony nygh a seruaunt fyrste to knowe his guydyng and condycyons and how he go¦uerneth hymselfe in his house & amonge his felowes and yf he vnderstadde hym of good condycyon and gouernaunce hauynge pacyence in his aduersyte re∣teyne and take hym than hardely and elles to bewa∣re of hym. ¶ And sayd Sedechias yf thou gaue a ve¦ry true frende that loueth the well thou ought to ta∣ke hym more in thy loue and fauoure than ony of thy∣kynnesmen desyrynge thy deth for to haue the succes∣syons yf the goodes. ¶ And sayd communely euery resamblaūce delyteth other. ¶ And sayd he that wyll not be chastysed by fayre and swete wordes / ought
to he corrected by sharpe and harde correccyon. ¶ And sayd the gretest rychesse is satisfaccyon of the herte. ¶ And sayd he is not ryche to whome ryches lasteth not ne whan they may be lyghtly take away but the best ryches is that thynge that dureth perpetually. ¶ And sayd the obeystaunce done by loue is more fer∣me than that that is done by myght or drede. ¶ And sayd that experyence is a good chastyement. ¶ And sayd the lokynge vpon the begynnynge of the werke yf it be good gyueth hope to the endynge. ¶ And sayd that good renowme and fame is ryght profytable in this worlde ye dedes therof auayle in the other worlde ¶ And sayd it is better a man to holde his peas than specke moche to ony ignoraunt man & to be alone than to be accompayned with euyll people. ¶ And sayde whan a kynge or a prynce is euyll tatched and vycy∣ous better is to them that haue no knowlege of hym than to those that be grettest mayster in his house. ¶ And sayd better is a woman to be barayn than to bere an euyll dysposed or a wycked chylde. And sayd the companye of a poore wyle man is better than a ryche ignoraunt that weneth to be wyse by subtylte. ¶ And sayd he that offēded god his creatours by gre∣ter reason he fayleth tho other. ¶ And sayd by leue not in hym that sayd he loueth and knoweth trouthe and doth the contrary. ¶ And sayd the ignoraunt mē wyll not absteyne them from theyr sensualytes but loue theyr lyfe for theyr pleasaunce / what defence soo euer be made vnto them / ryght as chyldren enforce them selfe to ete swete thynges and the rather that they be charged ye contrary. But it is other wyse with wysemen for they loue theyr lyues but onely to doo
good dedys and to leue ydelnes and the delectacyons of this worlde. ¶ And sayd how many be compared ye werkes of them that entende the perfeccyon of the good thynges perpetuell to them that wyll put theyr delyces transytory. ¶ And sayd that the wyse men be¦re theyr greues and sorowes as they were swete vnto them knowynge theyr trouble pacyently take the en∣de therof shall be to theyr meryte. ¶ And sayd that it is profytable and good to do well to them that haue deserued it / and that is euyll done to do well to them that hath not deserued it. For all is lost that is gyuen vnto them ryght as the reyne falleth vpon the gra∣uell. ¶ And sayd he is happpy yt vseth his dayes in do¦ynge couenable thynges & taketh in this worlde but that / that is necessarye vnto hym and may not forbe∣re. Aplyenge hym selfe to doo good dedys and to leue the badde. ¶ And sayd a man ought not to be demed by his wordes but his werkes. For communely wor¦des ben vayn but by the dedes is knowen the harme or the prouffyt of euery thynge ¶ And sayd whā that almesse is distrybute to poore indygent people / it pro∣fyteth as a good medycyne couenably gyuen to them that be seke. But the almes gyuen to ye not indygent is as medycyne gyuen without cause. ¶ And sayd he is happy that wtdraweth his ere and his eye from all euyll thynges. ¶ And sayd the moost couenable dys∣pence that ony man may make in his lyfe it is that is sette in the seruyce of god and in good werke. ¶ And the seconde it that is spended in necessarye thynges that maye not be for borne as mete drynke clothynge & for remedyes ayenst sykenesse. ¶ And worst of all is that is dyspended in syn & euyll werke∴

One axed why he sayde so considerynge that he helde the opinyon yt a resonable soule myght not dye / he answered whan a resonable soule is conuerted to the nature of a beest wt out vse of reason all be it yt it be substaunce incorrupti∣ble yet is she reputed for deed for she leseth the intelle∣ctyf lyfe. He founde a yonge poore man syttynge vpon the see syde wepynge for ye aduersites of this world to whom he sayde dyspayre the not for yf yu werewt grete rychesse in the myddell of yonder see in grete danuger of thy body & of thy goodes yu wold wysshe ryght hert¦ly to be here wt onely thy lelfe saued / also & yf yu were prysoner & ye kepers wold sle the & take fro ye all yt euer yu haddest yu woldest be glad to haue onely the delyue∣raūce ypocras of thy body / the yon∣ge man answered yt he told hym trouth well than sayd sabyon vnto hym now thȳ∣ke thā that yu hast ben in all these daungers & hast esca∣ped them & arte now at thy free lyberte therfore holde the content wt the state that thou now standest in / & soo ye yonge man departed gre∣tely recomforted. yPocras was dyscy∣ple to esculapius the seconde whiche de∣stended
of blode royall / & he was the fyrste fynder of the art of physyke whiche he shewed & taught to his chyldren & commaunded it sholde not be lerned to ony straungers but onely from the fader to the sone & soo the sayd scyence to rest in them & commaunded yt they sholde dwell in the myddell habitacyon of grece in .iij. yle / & ypocras rested in the yle of Thau / and in the .ii. other Isles ye studye was lost in his dayes. The opy∣nyon of the fyrst Esculapius was that physyke sholde be vsed onely by experyence for it was neuer founden but onely therby. And so was it vsed .M.cccc. yere af∣ter that tyll an other physyen called Methyous whose opinyon was that experyence without reason was a daungerous thynge & so they vsed these two opyny∣ons .vij.C. yere tyll an other phisycyen came called Bramades / whiche dyspraysed ye experyence sayenge yt to many errours grewe therby & that in occupynge phisyke a man ought to vse reason onely not withstā∣dynge he had .iij. discyples whiche helde after hȳ .iij. dyuers opynyons. The one vsed experyence onyly the other reason onely. ye thyrde subtyll craftes & enchaū∣temētes. And so these .iij. weyes were vsed .vij.C. yere tyll that Plato came whiche taught dylygently the sayenges of his predecessours in his scyence & shewed that experyence onely was daūgerous & reason one∣ly coude not be suffycyent / & toke the bokes as well of subtyll crafte & enchauntement as those of onely rea∣son & brent them all but those that were of reason and experyence to gyder he reteyned & kept them & {con}maū∣ded that they sholde be vsed & after his dethe he lefte the crafte to .v. of his discyples. The fyrst to ordyene physyke to the body. The .ii. to boxe and to lette blode
The .iij. to hele woundes. The .iiij. to hele seke eyen. The .v. to kyntte & hele broken bones / and after this came Esculapius the .ii. whiche taught dilygently the dyuerse opynyons / and in especyall those of Plato / whiche he vsed and toke for moost true and resonable And he lefte after hym thre dyscyples that is to saye / ypocras & .ij. other whiche dyed & rested that scyen∣ce & craft onely in hym than rested ypocras alone per∣fyght in vertues in his dayes vsynge reason. ¶ The whiche ypocras seynge the crafte of physike in waye of {per}dicyon bycause all his felowes were dede / & that he was lefte onely in the yle of Than thought that he wolde for the moost profyt that the cratf therof we∣re shewed & taught not onely to his chyldren & kȳnes∣men / but generally to all that were apte to lerne it and dampned in that scyence dyuers thynges & added to certayn compylacyons in breue wordes. And cōmaū∣ded his two sones that were maysters of scyences yt they sholde shewe it generally for he sayd it was mo∣re couenable that it sholde be taught straungers able and apte to the lore than to his owne kynnesmen not disposed to lerne and as he ordeyned it was done & is vsed to this daye & in his lyfe he shewed it to dyuers straungers & made them expert therin takynge pro∣mysse of them to teche it further. It happed yt a kyn∣ke of Perse called Defour sent vnto ye kynge of thysle of thau called pylate prayeng hym to sende hym ypo∣cras & he wolde gyue hym .C. kyntalles yf golde / and than was ye lande of grece deuyded in many kyngdōs of ye whiche sōme gaue truage to the kynge of Perse And so dyd that of thau / the whiche bad ypocras go to yt sayd kynge of perse for to hele certayn pestylences

It was asked of hym a questyon of euyll & vyle thynges. To the whiche he answered no thynge. They asked hym wherfore he spake not. He sayde that scylence was ye answere of suche questy¦ons. ¶ And sayd this worlde is to no creature perpe∣tuall therfore then lette none dyfferre or delay to doo good thynges as longe as he may & namely that / yt he sholde wynne good renōmee therby. ¶ And sayde he that knoweth not trouth is rather lyke not to doo it than he that is enfourmed & taught therto. ¶ And sayd scyence is lyke a rote of a tre and operacyō is lyke the braunches & syence is lyke a thynge engendryng. And operacyon is lyke a thynge engendred. ¶ And sayde take a lytell of scyence at ones so that thou may ste kepe it and lerne more. For yf thou wylte take mo∣re at ones than they wytte may suffyse thou mayest lyghtly forgete all.
Pytagoras PYtagoras sayde ye it is a ryght bles∣sed and a noble thynge to serue god & to sauntefye his saynctes to dyspreyse the worlde to vse Iusty∣ce & of all vertues moost princypall is to absteyne hym from synne. And it is good to vse fastynges & studyes & to make hym to be beloued & it is good to haue scyence to vnder∣stande the trouth of thȳ∣ges / and to lerne it to the men & shewe it to the women he ordeyned also predy∣cacyons & to polysshe & enorne ye speche. ¶ And sayde ye soule is {per}petuall & couenable to receyue merytes & peynes he moderated soo his mete & his drynke ye he was at no tyme fatter nor lener than other he was a subtyll man & loued as well to do good to his frendes as to hym selfe / sayenge ye goodes of frendes ought to be comyn.

And whan pytagoras sat in his chayre he vsed in she wynge his doctrynes to say. Mesure your pathes & go the ryght waye & so shall ye go surely. Attempre you from couetyse and your good estate shall dure / vse Iustyce & ye shall be beloued & dredde / kepe not your body in grete delectacyons for and ye so doo ye shall not consusteyne the aduersytes that myght fall vnto you. And he sawe an olde man that was shamefast to lerne to whom he sayde. Scyence is better in age than in youth. ¶ And sayd yf thou wylt dyspreyse hȳ that thou hatest shewe not that thou art his enmye. ¶ And sayde a good kynge or prynce ought to thynke dylygentely to the state and guydyn of his lande / and ought to ouerse it as often as a good gardyner dothe his garden. ¶ And sayde it behoueth a kynge to gyue example hym selfe to kepe his lawes and se that his next kynnesmen and frendes do so after hym & it ap∣parteyneth not to a kynge to be proude nor to do after his owne wyll onely nor to ryde couertely / nor in no derke nyght but gladely shewe hym selfe open faced amonge his people and subiectes and conuenyently be conuersaunt amonge them without ouermoche famylyaryte.

It fortu∣ned his wyfe was decessed in a ferre countre & some axed hym yf there were ony dyfference to dye in theyr propre lande elles ferre frome thens. He answered whersomeuer one dye the waye to the other world is all lyke. ¶ And sayde to ayonge man that wolde not lerne in his yought / yf thou wyl not take payne to ler¦ne thou shalt haue payne to be lewde & vnconnynge. ¶ And sayd god loueth those that be dysobeysaunt to euyll temptacyon. ¶ And sayde good prayer is one of the best thynges that a man may present to god / yf yu axe hym ony bone lette thy werkes be agreable vn∣to hym∴ Dyogenes DYogenes other wy∣se called dogly by∣cause he had some cōdicyōs of a dogge & he was the wy¦sest man that was in his dayes. He dispraysed grete¦ly the worlde and laye in a tōne whiche he tourned for his auantage from the son¦ne and the wynde as it plea¦sed hym / & therin he rested where someuer the nyght fyll vpon hym he ete whan someuer he was hungred / were it by daye or by nyght in the strete or elles where without ony shame therof and was content with two gownes of wollen cloth in
the yere and so he lyued and gouerned hymselfe tyll his deth. Some asked hym why he was called dogly he sayde by cause I barke vpon the fooles and fawne vpon the wysemen. Alexandre the grete came vnto hym of whom he toke lytell regarde. He axed hȳ why he set so lytell by hym sayēge that he was so myghty a kynge and hadde no necessyte. He answered I haue nought to do nor set by hym that is bonde man to my thrall. Why sayd Alexandre am I so than. ye sayd dyo¦genes for I am lorde and maystre to all couetyse and holde her vnder my fete as my thrall and couetyse is thy maystresse and thou arte bounde vnto her and so art thou bounde to my thrall. Than sayd Alexander yf thou wylt axe me ony thynge of his worlde I wyll gyue it the. Dyogenes answered why shulde I aske the ony thynge whyles I am rycher than thou art for that lytell that I haue contenteth me better than all the grete quantyte yt thou hast satisfyeth the. I praye the stande out of my lyght and take not frome me that that thou mayest not gyue me. well sayd Alexander who shall bery the whan thou art deed / he that wyll not suffre the stenche of my caryen aboue the erthe. ¶ And the sayde Dyogenes sayd he is not parfytely good that doth but onely absteyne hym from euyll de∣dys. He sawe a yonge man of good and vertuouse dis∣posycyon whiche was euyl visaged to whom he sayd the goodnes and vertues that be in the gyue beaute in the face / & som asked hym whan it was tyme a mā to ete / he sayde whan he had appetyte & mete & yf he had none whan he myght gete it. And sayd it is good a mā kepe hym from the gyle of his ennemye and the
euyll of his frende. ¶ And sayde ryght as a man ape∣reth greter in a myst than in a clere wedder ryght so appereth more his vyce in his Ire than in his pacyen¦ce. ¶ And sayd to Alexandre thynke not thou arte the more worthy for thy beaute tresour and ryche araye but onely for thy lyberalyte & goodnesse. ¶ And sayde whan thou dispraysest a vyce in an other man loke yt thou vse it not thy selfe. ¶ And sayde whan thou seest a dogge leue his mayster and folowe the dryue hym awaye for ryght so wyll he leue the to go to a nother. He sawe a man that prayed god gyue hym sapyence to whom he sayde thy petycyon auayleth not without but fyrst thou payne thy selfe to lerne it. ¶ And sayde of all vertues of humanyte the gretter quantyte ther¦of is the better saue of wordes. ¶ And sayde it is not honest to gyue prasynge to a man of a thynge that he hath not deserued. ¶ He sawe a peyntour that was waxen a phisycyen to whom he sayd / thou knowest yt men myght se at the eye the fautes that thou dydest in chy crafte but now they may not be parceyued for they are hydde vnther the erthe. And he sawe ryght a fayre persone whiche was a foole / and than he sayd there is a fayre house & ryght and euyll honeste herbo¦rowed therin. He sawe a also foole sytte in a wyndowe and he sayde there sytteth a stone vpon a stone. One asked hym what was loue he sayd it was a sekenesse that grew of Idelnesse & for lacke of vertuouse exerci∣se. One asked hym what was rychesse he sayd abstey¦nynge fro couetyse. The sayd dyogenes was in a sea∣son feke and his frendes came to visyte hym sayenge dowte you not for your sekenesse come but of goddes wyll he answered therfore am I the more aferde. He
sawe an olde man that dyed his heyres to whome he sayde yu mayst well hyde thy with heres but not thyn age. ¶ And sayd it is more behouefull yu go to ye leche than the leche to the & semblably I say it of the leche of the soule. ¶ And sayde yf yu wylte correcte ony man shewe it not by vyolence but as the surgyen doth to ye seke that is to saye souftely and pacyently but & thou wylt correcte thy selfe dyspose the as ye hurt mā doth to ye leche. It was asked hym how a man myght ke∣pe hym from Ire he answered a man ought alwaye to haue in remēbraunce yt he can not all tymes be ser∣ued / but somtyme shall be fayn to do seruyce and also he shall not be alway obeyde but at somtyme he must obeyde / and therfore he shall not atte all tymes be suf∣fered in his wyll but that attesomtyme he must suf∣fre hauynge this in his mynde it sholde appease his Ire. And there came a gester a fore Alexander syttyng at his dyner whiche praysed hym outrageously & dy∣uerse herkened gretly therto the sayde Dyogenes be∣gan to ete faster than before some asked hym why he herkened not the fayre sayenges of the gester / he an∣swered I do more profytable than to herkene lesyn∣ger what is suche praysinge worth whan he is neuer the better therfore. ¶ And sayde yf thou talke with a straunger speke not to moche tyll thou haue fyrst ma∣de comparyson by twene connynge of his scyence and thyn and yf thou fynde thyn better that his speke the blodelyer and ellys holde thy paese and lerne at hym Dyuers delycyous persones blamed hym of his ma∣ner of lyuynge and he sayde it lyeth well in my pouer yf me lyst to lyue after your guyse but it is not in your pouer to lyue after my maner. And it was tolde hym
that certayn {per}sones had sayd euyll of hym in his ab∣sence / he answered it shall not hurt me though a man stryke at me & touche me not. ¶ And sayd it is a chur∣lysshe condycyon to answere dyshonestly & a noble con∣dycyon to answere pacyently. ¶ And sayd there is no gretter tresour than dyscrecyon and wytte nor gretter pouerte than Ignoraūce nor better frendesshyp than good condycyons / nor better guyder than is good for∣tune. ¶ And sayde sekenesse is the pryson of the body & sorowe is the pryson of the soule. There was a man of grete byrthe that rebuked hym to whom he sayde my blood & lygnage is enchaunsed by me and thyn is hurt and lowed by the. The sayde Diogenes was of lytell speche / & one asked hym why he spake no more he answered there was grete v{er}tues in a mānes eres There was a man sayd hym grete vylanye to whom he sayd noo worde / one asked hym why he answered not. He sayde I coude hym do noo greter dysworshyp than he doth hymselfe for he hath contrybued blamed vnto hym that hath not deserued it. One asked hym how he sholde trouble his enymyes he answereth en force thy selfe to be vertuous and good. And yf thou wolt that thy goodnes appered grete vnto straūgers repute to them thy selfe lytell. ¶ And sayd yf thou gy¦ue power to thy wyfe onely to trede vpon thy fote on the morowe she wolde trede vpon thy hede. And sayd cōpany of women is an harme that can not be esche∣wed. ¶ And sayde he that doth good for the goodnes of it onely ought not to drede before whome he dothe / nor for the praysynge ne blame therof. One asked hym whan he sholde knowe his frende. He sayd in ne∣cessyte. For in prosperyte euery man is frendely ther
was another man sayd vylanye vnto hym where at he toke none angre. It was asked hym why he was so pacyent he answered other he sayd soth or lyed / yf he haue sayd trouth Iought not to be angry and yet lesse yf he haue lyed. He sawe a man clatre so moche yt ther coude no body make hym hold his paes to whom he sayd frende thou hast two eres and but one tonge. Wherfore thou oughtest to herke double as moche as you spekest. He sawe a fayre yonge man the whiche dyde grete dylygence to lerne to whom he sayde ye do passynge well to make youre dedys resemble youre beatute∴ Socrates SOcrates in gre∣kes tonge is to say keper of Iustyce. he was maryed ayenst the custu∣me of that coūtre whiche was that good and ver∣tuous people shoulde be wedded to gyder to then∣tent that theyr lygnage myght gete better / but he wedded the worst wo∣man that was in all the lande & had .iii. chyldren by her. He loued and wor∣shypped sapyence so mo∣che yt it was a grete hynderaūce to all his successours for he wold not suffre his scyence to be wryten. ¶ And sayd that scyence was pure & clene wherfore it was co¦uenable she sholde be onely sette in mynde & corage & not in skynnes of deed beestes nor in no suche corrupte
thynge & therfore he made no bokes nor gaue no doc∣tryne to his dyscyples but onely by wordes of dyscy∣plyne. And that opynyon he helde of Tunyo whiche was his mayster for as the sayd Socrates beynge of tendre age / asked his mayster / why wyll ye not suffre me to wryte ye doctrynes that ye teche me. Tunyo an∣swered hym couetest thou more yt wyld beestes skyn∣nes to be worshypped with sapyence / than thengyne of a man. I sette the case that one mete the in yt wyld feld & aske the coūseyle vpon a questyon wete it good that thou sholdest say / lette me go home and ouer see my bokes fyrst it were more honest to haue recours to thy remembraunce & ther vpon & brefly to determy∣ne. It were so certamely sayde Socrates, well than reteyne it well in thyn mynde that thou shalt lerne / & put it not in the booke / in whiche opynyon the sayd so¦crates rested / he defended that noo man sholde wor∣shyppe false ydoles but wolde that all honour & wor∣shyp sholde be referred to the creatur of all thynges and for that opynyon he was condempned to deth by xij. Iuges of Athenes whiche ordeyned that he shold drynke certayn poysons wherof the kynge of yt coun∣tre was sory but he coude not reuoke the sencente he gaue hym as longe respyte of his Iugment as he coude. ¶ The sayd kynge had a shyp charge wt thyn¦ges that in certayn tymes sholde be offred in the tem∣ple to the Idoles he had a custume that he wolde gy∣ue no Iugement and especyally vpon mannes dethe tyll ye sayd shyppe were retorned to Athenes whiche was not yet come home. And vpon there commȳge ho¦me one of Socrates felawes called Inclytes told hȳ in the pryson yt the sayd shyp sholde come to the porte

Iūges they axed hȳ many doubtable questyōs thouchynge ye soule he an∣swered them as largely & as gladly as euer he dyde / wherof they merueylled to vse soo greate constaunce in a man so nyghe his deth one of his dyscyples called demon sayd Mayster I know well it is an harde thȳ¦ge to the for to shewe and teche vs in ye cas that thou now standest in and lackynge of thy lore is to vs a da∣mageous thynge for in this world hast thou no felow of good doctryne. Socrates answered spare not to enquyre of me what it pleaseth you / for it is to me a
grete pleasure. They axed hym questyons of the sou∣le whiche he answered. And after they axed hym of ye state of the worlde and composycyon of the elementes whiche also he answered ryght perfoūdely / & he sayd vnto them I trowe the houre of my deth approcheth nygh I wyl bayne me & make me clene in this world and saye myn orysons to thentent that I shal haue no payne after my deth / wherfore I praye you spare me for a whyle he entred in to a hous / & baygned hym & sayd his orysons / & thā called his wyf & his chyldren & gaue them many fayre doctrynes / & bad them pay∣ne them for to do good & adresse theyr soules to hym that all created / & than came one frome the Iuges to hym wt poyson to drynke & sayde. O Socrates thyn∣ke not that I am he yt maketh ye to deye / for I knowe thou arte the best man yt euer came in this lande but I am sent frome the Iuges for to sle the & here is the confeccyon that thou must drynke take it pacyētly sy∣then thou mayst not scape it. Socrates sayd I take it with good herte & knowe well thou art not gylty ther¦of & so dranke it. And whan his frendes saw that they made grete wepynge & lamentacyon wherof he bla∣med them saynge I haue sent awaye the women by¦cause they sholde not do as ye do. He wente a lytell fro them & sayd. O god haue mercy vpon me and anone his synewes shranke his fete wexed colde / & than he leyde hym downe / one of his dyscyples toke a bodde∣kyn and prycked hym in his feete and axed hym yf he felte ony thynge / and he sayde naye / than he prycked hym in his thyghes & axed hym yf he felt it he sayde naye. Anone the colde strake vp vnto his sydes than Socrates sayde whan the colde cometh vnto my hert
I must nedys dye. Than sayd Inclites O dere may∣ster well of sapyence & of scyence correct and theche vs yet whyle the speche lasteth. to whom he sayde I can none other wyse shewe you now dyenge than I haue done afore in my lyfe.

There was greater reuerence made to an other man than to hym wherfore one axed hym yf he had ony enuye there at. He answered yf he had more scyence than I / I wolde haue had enuye at hym or ellys not. ¶ And sayde sa∣pience & good renōme is not founde but in good perso∣nes wherfore they be better than the greate rychesse yt is founde in foule & euyll people. ¶ And sayd thy sou∣le ought to thynke well and thy body to helpe therto. ¶ And sayd that thou oughtest kepe secret in thy cou∣rage dyscouere it not to euery man. ¶ And sayde one vnto hym that sawe hym in a poore clothynge this is Platon not Socrates thus poorely arrayed yt gaue the lawes to the people of Athenes to whom he answered ye true lawe is not made by good arayement but by vertue / reason / & scyence. And sayd to his dysciples dispreyse ye deth & sēblably drede it. and sayde a wyse man ought to knowe what is his soule. PLaton is by īterpre∣tacyon as moche to saye as endeth or fulfylled and was of grece by his fa∣ders
syde he was of the noble Esculapius kynrede & by his moders syde of the kynrede of zalon that ordei∣ned dyuerse lawes as it is aboue sayde he dwelled wt Socrates the space of fyue yeres / and after the deth of the sayd Socrates he vnderstode yt in egypte were certayn of Pytagoras dyscyples to whom he went & profyted moche in lernynge with them he retorned than agayn to Athenes / & there he ordeyned two sco∣les & vsed laudable lyfe in doynge good werkes hel∣pynge and nouryshynge the nedy people. And they of Athenes wolde haue made hym theyr lorde. He refu∣sed it vtterly for as moche as he knewe them of bad & wycked condycyons and knewe well that coude not lyghtly chaūge theyr dysposycyons. And also he wyst well yf he shold correcte them lyke as it apperteyneth they wold serue hȳ as they dyd Socrates. The sayd Plato lyued .lxi. yeres a man of good discrecyon dispo∣sycyon & eyght pacyent & a grete gyuer of his goodes to poore men & to straungers. And he had many dysci∣ples amonge the whiche .ii. of them after his deth yt is to witte zenocrates & Aristoteles helde the scoles. And the sayd Platon dyd teche his sapyēce by allego∣rye to thentent that it sholde not be vnderstande but by wytty men And he lerned it of tymeo & of Socra∣tes / he made .vi. bokes & preched & taught the people that they sholde gyue graces and thankes to god for his goodnes and mercy / and for that he made them all egall in so moche that be a man neuer so myghty his power can no more thā yf he were a poore creature re∣syste ayenst deth semblably he bad and thanked god for the wytte yt he hath gyuen vnto man. ¶ And sayd ymage no thynge to be in hym but that is nedefull

And suche suf∣fysaunce is called Sapyence / the whiche ye ought to haue with the drede of god whiche is the key of good∣nesse / wherby ye may entre & atteyne to the good and true rychesse of this worlde leuynge to do all thynge that may cause hattered & euyll wyll for and ye wyst howe some thynges that ye loue and preyse are euyll and vyle / ye wolded haue them in more hattered than loue. ¶ And sayde dyrecte and amende your selfe and after labour to correcte other and yf ye do not ye shall be dampned. And I tel you ye thynge yt hath made me syluer / moost glad Is that I haue not set by golde ne for yf I had gadred grete tresour I sholde haue had many heuy thoughtes where I haue nowe Ioye & gladnes whiche encreaseth daylye in me in lernynge wysedom & for to lete you wete that golde and syluer are not good to be ouermoche set by. There is some contre that a lytell yuory or vnycorne bone is bought for a greate some of golde & in other places men take glasses bras and other suche thynges / for as moche golde. And therfore yf it were perfytely good of hym selfe he sholde be egally chosen & loued ouer all lyke as sapyence is chosen and loued in euery contre. ¶ And sayd enquere and seke to haue vertues and ye shall be saued / prayse no foule thynges & blame no thynge yt is laudable & trauayll you not for to wynne thynges that shall lyghtly be lost folowe after your good pre∣decessours arraye you with iustyce & clothe you with chastyte & so ye shall be happy & your werkes lauded ¶ And sayd custome is a greate thynge. ¶ And sayde
the wycked werkes dampne & destroye the good & ye byttrenesse of alloe tree dystroyeth the swetenesse of hony. ¶ And sayd a wyse man ought not to thȳke on his losses but ought to kepe well ye remenaunt of his good. ¶ And sayd he yt doth not for his frendes why∣le he may they wyll leue hȳ whan he shall haue moost nede to them. ¶ And he sayd that sapience is good for she can neuer be loste as other catalles & wordely goo∣des may. And it was axed hym where by a wyse mā myght be knowen / & he answered whan he wyll not be wroth of the Iniuryes that ben done vnto hym & reioyseth hym not whan mē preyse hym. And it was axed of hym howe men myght best be venged of theyr enemyes he answered for to be vertuous & to do good and noble dedys. ¶ And sayd to his dyscyples enforc you to gete scyences / by the whiche ye shall dyrecte your soules. And do your part for to kepe the lawe in suche wyse that your maker may be content with you And he saw a yonge man that had solde the lyuelode that was come to hym by successyon & he dyspende it amysse in grete dyuers & other mysrewle to whom he sayd the erthe eteth other men but thy selfe etest the erthe. And it was axed of hym why it is that tresour & scyence may not accorde to gyder and he answered & sayd that one thynge hole accōplysshed may not be deuyded. ¶ And sayd that he that trusteth in his for∣tune and is not somwhat besye & dylygent to labour in good werkes the good resorted frome hym as doth the arowe from the stone that it hath lyght vpon∴ ¶ And sayd he that techeth good to other and doth it not hym selfe. Is lyke to hym that lyghteth a candel to an other & goth hym selfe darkelynge. ¶ And sayd
a kynge ought not to be gretly preysed that reygneth onely but vpon his subiectes / but he ought to haue laude ye reygneth & hath lordshyp vpon his enemyes ¶ And sayde he that gadreth & assembleth moche syl∣uer ought not to be called ryche but he that dispēdeth it worshypfully and laudably. And some asked hym how one myght kepe hȳ from nede. And he answered yf men by ryche late hym lyue tēporatly & sobrely & yf they be poore lete thē labour dilygentely. Than some axed hym of how moche good a man ought to be con∣tent And he answered to haue so moche as he nedeth not to flater nor borowe of other.. ¶ And sayde to his dyscyples whan ye shall be wery of studyenge / sporte you ī redynge good storyes. ¶ And sayd that the wy∣se man ought not to coueyte the rychesses of his fren∣de lest he be hated and dyspreyse hym therfore. ¶ And sayd a lytell good is a greate thynge yf thou be cōtent there with. ¶ And sayde it is better and a more coue∣nable thynge to a kynge to remembre & se to the good gouernaūce of his people the space of a daye than for to daunce & sporte hym a hole yere. ¶ And sayde wer∣kes done by wysdome causeth knowledge of thynges & them dyscretly to dyscerue & werkes done by igno∣raunce is an vnknowē thynge tyll trouth stable & set them in theyr ryght waye & werkes done by lesynges is for to disordre good thynges and putte them out of theyr propre places. ¶ And sayd thou shalt neuer be paciēt whyle yu art couetous & it was asked hȳ how he myght haue lerned so moche wysdom he answere by¦cause I haue put more oyle ī my lāpe to studye by thā wyne in my cup. And it was axed of hym what mā is
moost couenable for to gouerne a towne / & he answe∣red he that can well gouerne hymselfe / & it was also axed of hym what man was moost worthy to be cal∣led wyse / & he answered he that taketh moost hede to good counseyll & casteth moost doubtes. ¶ And sayde that the vessels of gold be proued & knowen by theyr sowne yf they be broken or hole soo are men proued & knowen by theyr speche yf they be wyse or fooles / and It was axed hym whiche be the most ignoraūt men in theyr dedes / & he sayd suche as werke moost after theyr owne counseyll & that obeye to them selfe / and for defaunte of good aduysement dyspose them har∣dely to doo wycked dedes. And they axed hym whoo dooth moost wronge to hym selfe. And he sayd he that meketh hym to those that he ought not. ¶ And sayde the Ignoraunt people Iugeth lyghtly the fayrenes or the fylth yt they se outwarde / & the wyse mā iugeht by that yt they se of mannes condycyons. ¶ And sayd he fyndeth sapyence that seketh her by ye ryght waye and many erre bycause they seke her vnduely & bla∣me her without cause. ¶ And sayd he yt is ignoraunt of good sapience knoweth not hym selfe. And the per∣sone ye whiche knoweth not hymselfe is of all Igno∣rauntes the moost ignoraūt / and he is wyse that kno∣weth ignoraunce and he that knoweth it not is igno∣raunt. ¶ And sayd wrath ledeth shame in a lese.

Also whan men entende not to encreace the people to in habyte the lande. and also whan warre la∣steth longe therin. ¶ And sayde the ende of indygna∣cyon is to be ashamed of hymselfe And it was axed of hym how a wyse man coude be troubled / & he answe∣red whan he is compelled to tell the trouth of an vn∣knowen thynge to hym. ¶ And sayd whā thou shalte se a man of good disposycyon and full of perfeccyon thou ought to do after hym for couetyse is both weke & seke in hym to do after hym. ¶ And sayd dyspreyse not a lytell thȳge for it may encreace. ¶ And sayd bla∣me not nor rebuke a man whā he is wroth / for than yu mayst not dyrecte hym. ¶ And sayd be not glad of the euyll fortune of another / for thou knowest not how ye world may tourne ayenste the. ¶ And sayd stable thy wytte both at thy ryght hande & thy left & thou shalt be fre. ¶ And sayd there be .iii. thynges that doth me harme to se / that is to saye.

Also haue in mynde the place where thou shalte goo / the lordes & the seruaūtes shal be all lyke in the sayde place & that there may nother frende no foo hurte nor helpe the. And therfore lerne good scyences & discyplyne / for thou shalt not knowe whan thy departynge oute of this worlde shall be / & yet be certayn that amonges all the gyftes of god sa∣pyence is the moost excellent / she gyueth goodenes to the good people & {per}donneth to the wycked theyr wyc∣kednes thynke and haue in thy mynde contynually that thou haste to doo all / and trust not in ony thynges of his moeuable worlde be well ware that thou doo no foule dedys for no delectacyons nor wynnynges / and beware that for the variable pleafaunces of this
wicked worlde thou lese not the ioyfull & euerlastyng blysse. ¶ And sayde loue sapyence vnderstande & her∣ken the wysemen & be obeyssāt to thy lorde werke not but in due tyme & yet take hede how thou shalt do it / loke that thou saye no worde vnconuenyent / & be not proude for no rychesses / ne despeyre the not for none euyll fortunes be well disposed to all people & dispra∣se no man for his mekenes. ¶ And sayd that thou re∣putest no vyce in thy selfe blame not an other though he do it and thou ought not to dsyre to be preysed of vertues that be not in the / ne do no suche thynge that thou woldest blame or disprayse an other yf he dyd it thou must do suche thȳges as ben good & couenable though they be forboden the. ¶ And sayd a wyse mā ought to repute his errour grete & his good dedys ly∣tell. ¶ And sayde a folye is to cut the synnes and take awaye the euyll brāches therof & to leue within oure selfe ye couetyses & otehr wyckednesses. ¶ And sayde lyke as we kepe our selfe from ye multytude of metes for ye helth of our body we ought by a greate reason to absteyne vs fro vyces for the saluacyon of our soules. ¶ And sayde the that addeth to his gentylnesse nobles∣se with good maners and condicyons is worthy to be preysed & he that taketh & suffyseth hym onely with the gentylnesse that cometh to hym by his kynred wt¦out purchassynge ony other vertues ought not to be called good nor to be holde noble. ¶ And sayd yf thou fele thy selfe more true to the kynge than other ben & that thy wages ben lyke to theyrs or lesse / yet thou ought not to complayne therof for thyn are lastynge & so are not theyrs. ¶ And sayde yf ony haue enuye at the and by enuye sayth euyll of the sett not there by

Arystotell ARystotell by inter∣pretacyon in gre∣kes tonge is fulfylled or complete of goodnes / and he was sone to Nycho∣macus / the whiche was ryght c̄onynge in physy∣ke & a good physycyen & was borne in ye towne of stragre & he was of ye kyn¦red both by his faders sy∣de & by his moders syde of Esculapius of the whi∣che here before hath be∣made mencyon. For he was in his tyme the moost excellent and the best of all the grekes. And whan the sayd Arestotell was .viii. yere of age his fader put hym in the Cyte of Athe∣nes that than was called the Cyte of wysedome / and
there he lerned gramarye rethoryke and other bokes of poetrye and therm he studyed the space of .ix. yeres profytynge gretly therin. And in those dayes men set moche store by the foresayd scyences & was theyr opy¦nyon that it was the laddre to go vp in to all other scyences. ¶ And certayn other wysemen at the same tyme as Pytagoras and Pytoras and dyuers other reputed and helde the sayde scyences for noo scyence and dyd but mocke and scorne them that lerned them sayenge that suche scyence as gramarye Rethoryke and poetrye were not couenable to come to ony wys∣dom. And that gramayre is not but for to teche chyl∣dren poetrye but for to tell fables and to make lesyn∣ges Rethoryke for to speke fayre and in tremes. And whan Arystotell herde these wordes he had grete mer¦uayl therof and was gretly agreued with suche as helde the same opynyon & strenghted hym after his power to susteyne all manere of gramaryens the peo∣tes / and also the rethorycyeus. And sayde plenyly that sapyence canne not excuse her of the sayd scyen∣ces for reason is an Instrument of wytte as it appe∣reth openly that knowynge of ony thynge is to vse of reason. And this prerogatyue whiche god hath gyuē to men is ryght noble and worthy to thentente that amonges the men he sholde be holden for the moost noble and moost wyse that more vseth of reason∴ ¶ And that better and more couenable receyueth in his herte thynges and telleth them in place an tyme couenable and for as moche as sapyence is moost no∣ble of all other thynges she ought to be declared by the best reason and conuenable manere and by the
moost plesaunt and shorte wordes that can be done without errour or lettynge the sentence for yf the rea∣son be spoken parfytely the name of wysedom is lost therby / & so is the speker in fawte / and soo the herers resten in doubte of the sentence. And after that Ary∣stotell coude the scyences aboue sayd he lerned of pla∣to in a place called epydeme ethykes and the .iiii. scyē¦ces theologykes and that tyme he was .xvii. yere of age. And whan Platon went the seconde tyme in to Cecyle he lefte Arystotell in his place in ye sayde two∣ne of epydeme / in the whiche he taught the scyence & lerned it. And after the deth of Plato the kynge Phy∣lyppe of macedone sente for Arystotell whiche wente to hym in macedone / & there dwelled with hym du∣rynge his lyfe techynge contynually the sayd scyence and after the deth of kynge Philyppe reygned his so∣ne Alexandre the greate / and whan Alexandre depar∣ted from macedone for to go in to the countre and re∣gyon of dayse tho retourned Arystotell to Athenes & ther he dwelled .x. yeres studiēge tyll that he became a souerayn clerck / and a preste accused hym by enuye to the Cytezyns tellynge them that he worshypped not theyr ydolles lyke as other people dyd at that ty∣me / wherof Arystotell was aduertysed & hastely de∣parted fro Athenes & went in the towne of Setagy∣re where he was borne ferynge that they of Athenes wolde haue done to hym as they dyde to Socrates yf he had dwelled lenger with them. And he ordeyned a place in Setagyre where he held and kept the scoles gyuynge many good instruccyons to the people and occupeyd the tyme in good dedys and gaue greate al∣mesdedys to poore people & maryed many poore chyl∣dren
that were fader lesse and moder lesse. ¶ And he thaught benygnely all tho that wolde studye. What estate or nacyon that euer they were of / and edyfyed & buyled newe ayen the sayd eyte yf Setagyre & there in ordeyned lawes and gaue instruccyons to kynges and pryncis whiche they toke and kepte ryght reue∣rently. And after he dyed in the age of .lxiii. yeres they of Satagyre toke his bones and ryght worshypfully put them in a shryne where they helde theyr counseyll for his grete wytte / and also for the greate and feruent loue that they had to hym. And as oftentymes as they hadde to do ony grete mater for to haue the decla∣racyon therof the mē whiche were of counseyll wold go and stande as nyghe the sayd shryne where the bo∣nes were as they coude / for to haue knowlege of the trouth of theyr matere. And thus they dydde for to worshyp hym the more and theyr opynyons and ve∣ry trust were for onely beynge nyghe the sayd shryne theyr wyttes sholde be the better & theyr vnderstan∣dynge more pure and subtyll. ¶ And the sayd Arysto∣tell hadde in his tyme many kynges sones that were his discyples. And he made in his dayes well an hon∣dred bokes / of the whiche we haue now .xxviii. in lo∣gyke .viii. in nature / the booke of Ethykes / the booke of Polytykes / the booke of Metaphysyke that is na∣med theologyke / and the bookes of the wyttes of geo∣metrye. And Platon rebuked hym bycavse that he wrote his scyences in bookes / to whom he sayd in ex∣cusynge hym / that it is a thynge knowen & notyfyed ynoughe that all tho that loued scyence ought to do nothynge that sholde cause ye losse of her / and therfore
it is good to compose & make bokes by the whiche scy∣ence shal be lerned / and whan oure memorye shal fayll it shall be recouered by meane of bookes. For he that hateth scyence shall not profyte in it thought it be so that he se the bookes and beholde them yet shall he set not by it but departe wors and les wyse than he was afore. And I haue made and ordeyned my bookes in suche forme that the wysemen shall lyghtly and ease¦ly vnderstande them but the ignoraunt men shall ha∣ue but lytell auayle be them. ¶ And the sayde Arysto∣tell helde gladly in his hande an instrument of sterres ¶ And sayd to kynge Alexandre he that hath in this worlde good and laudable name and the grace of god ought to aske ne desyre none other thynge. ¶ And sayd thus to hym dyrecte thy selfe fyrst for yf thou be not Iuste how mayest thou well dyrecte thy people & yf thou be in errour thou canst neuer gouerne them well / for a poore man can not make an other ryche he that is dysworshypped can not worshyp an other / he that is ryght seble may not helpe an other / & so may not goodely ne well ony man dyrecte an other / but yf he dyrecte hym selfe fyrst. And therfore yf thou wyll take of the fylthes frome other clense thy selfe fyrst∴ Or elles thou shalte be as the leche that is seke & can not hele hym selfe & trauayleth to hele other that ha∣ue the same sekenesse. ¶ And sayd it is a grete chasty∣sement to the people to haue a ryght wys lorde / and it is a greate corrupcyon vnto them to haue a corrupt and mysruled kynge. ¶ And sayd kepe the fro couety∣se / for thou oughtest to thynke and remembre well
that it is not laudable thynke to haue rychesses ī this worlde and shame in the other seynge that this worl∣de is no more but onely a baytynge place for to go to the other worlde. ¶ And sayde yf thou wyll be ryche suffyse ye with suche as thou hast for he that hath not suffysaūce can neuer be ryche what goodes that euer he hath. ¶ And sayde yf it were so that by euyll doȳge it sholde fortune the to haue some good / and by well doynge to haue some harme / yet eschewe the euyll or ellys thou shalt be deceyued at last / and euer do well and at last thou shalt be remunered therfore. ¶ And sayd suche thynges as thou preyses vpō they self bla¦me it not vpon an other. And do noo thynge to other but as thou woldest it were done to the refrayne thyn owne wyll and hate not other men / be not enuyous and haue hym not in Indygnacyon that hath offen∣sed the for noo man can somtyme eschewe errour / be not couetous / for couetyse letteth the mannes reason and taketh away the knowlege of trouth. Do not vn∣conuenable werkes / take companye with wysemen & studye in theyr bookes. Fle lesynges / for the lyers ly∣en not but for vnknowynge of reason. And yf theyr soules the lest harme that can fall to a lyer is that no man bylyueth hym of no thynge that he sayd.

To whome he sayd. I haue herde the prayer that ye haue made for me besechynge to god that he wyll ste¦defaste the loue of me in your hertes and corages / & that by noo maner of delectacyon he suffre me to doo thynge ayenst your proufytes ne to my dysworshyp.

And after this Alexander made grete conquestes & whan he had conquered ynde he wente to a countre callyd bragman / the whiche whan they wyst of his comynge they sent many wysemē to hym whiche salewed hym and sayd. Syr Alexander thou haste no cause to werre vpon vs ne to be euyll wyllyn∣ge for we ben both poore and meke and we haue noo thynge but onely sapyence / the whiche yf thou wylt haue pray to god that he wyll gyue her to the.

And whan Alxean∣der herde theym say so he made all his Oost to tarye and with few of his knyghtes wēte within the sayd coūtre for to enquyre further of the trouth. And whan he entred within the same grounde he founde many poore folkes women & chyldre all naked gaderynge herbes in the feldes & he axed of them many questy∣ons to whiche they answered ryght wysely and than he bad them axe hym some thynge that myght do them good and to all theyr people & he wolde gyue it them gladly. And than they sayd syr we axe the none other thynge but that thou wylt gyue vs euerlaynge fe. Tyhan Allexander answered & sayd how myght
a man make other mennes lyues euerlastynge whan he may not lengthe his owne lyfe an houre / & that ye axe of me is in no mannes power that lyueth. Than they sayd to hym syth thou hast good knowleche ther¦of / wherfore trauaylest thou thy selfe to destroye all the worlde / and to gadre all the worldely tresours and wotest not whan thou must leue thē. Than Alexāder sayde to them I do not all these thynges that ye saye of myselfe / but god hath sente me thorught all ye worl∣de for to exalte & magnyfye his lawe and to destroye them that byleue not in hym. And somtyme Alexan∣der wente dysguysed vysytynge his lordes & enquy∣rynge of theyr dedys. And vpon a tyme he came in to a towne of his owne / & sawe two men of the same towne before a Iuge pletynge of the whiche one sayd to the Iuge. Syr Iuge I haue bought an hous of this man / and longe after I haue founde within the same a tresour within therthe whiche is not mȳ / & I haue offred to delyuer it to hym / & he hath refused it / wherfore syr I beseche the that he be cōpelled to take it / for as moche as he knoweth it is not myn for I ha¦ue no ryght therto. Than the Iuge cōmaunded his aduerse partye to answere to the same & than he sayd / syr Iuge that same tresour was neuer myn / but he hath edyfyed in that place that was before comyn to all them that wolde haue edyfyed therin / and therfore I haue no ryght to take it / & than they both requyred the Iuge that he wolde take it to hym selfe to whom he answered & sayde / sythen it is so as ye saye that ye haue no ryght to whom ye heritage hath longed & yet longeth where the tresour was foūde how shold I ha¦ue ony ryght therto that am but a straunger in ye caas
& neuer afore herde speke therof / ye wolde excuse you therof & gyue me ye charge of the tresour that is euyll do. Than he axed of hym that had founde the tresour whether he had ony chyldrē whiche answered he had a sone / & he axed that other in lyke wyse / & he sayd he had a doughter / than the Iuge sayd & Iuged yt a ma∣ryage sholde be made betwene them & that they shold haue ye tresour by yt meane. And whan Alexander her¦de this Iugement he had grete meruayl therof And sayd thus to the Iuge. I trow that there is not in all the worlde so ryght wyse ne so true a Iuge as yu arte & the Iuge that knewe hym not sayd & axed of hym whether ony Iuge wyll haue done other wyse ye cer∣taynly sayd Alexander in many landes / than ye Iuge hauynge grete meruayll therof axed of hym whether it rayned & ye sōne dyd shyne in tho landes as though he wolde haue sayd / that it was meruayl yt god shold sende ony lyght or rayne or other good thynges to thē that do not rygt & true Iustyce / and therof Alexander had gretter meruayll than before and sayd that there were but fewe suche people vpon erthe as they were in that lande. And as alexander wente out of ye lande he passed thrugh a cyte in whiche all ye houses of that cyte were of one heyghte and before the dore of euery hous was a grete pyte or graue in whiche cyte there was no Iuge / wherof he had grete maruayll & axed of the inhabitauntes therin wherfore suche thynges sholde serue the whiche answered hym a sayd. Fyrste for the outragyous heyght of houses loue & Iustyce can not be longe in a towne amonge the people & they sayd that the pytes or graues were theyr owne hou∣ses to whiche they sholde sone go to & there dwell vn∣tyll
the daye of Iugement / & as touchynge that they had no Iuge they sayd that they made good Iustyce of them selfe wherfore they neded no Iuge. Than Alexander departed from thē ryght well pleased / and afore his deth he wrote a lettre vnto his moder desy∣rynge her to make no sorowe for hym and soone after Alexander dyed and was put in a coffre of golde / and buryed in alysādre & he was borne thyder with grete reuerence by kynges prynces and other greate lordes that kept and sulfylled his testamēt as he had ordey∣ned. Than stert vp one of the gretest lordes of them that kept hym & sayd thus / they that neuer wepte for other kynges now ought to wepe for this same & tho that neuer hadde meruayll of aduersyte sholde now haue graete meruayll of the dethe of this kynge / and he desyred the other lordes that they sholde saye some good thynge for to cōforte the people that was gretly dysmayed and troubled for the deth of kynge Alexan∣der as for the dethe of the worthyest kynge that euer was. Than one of them sayd kynge Alexander was wont to kept golde and syluer / and now gold & syluer kepe hym. And he sayd it bycause of the chest that his body laye in whiche was of golde. And another sayd Alexander is departed from synnes and fylthes and now his soule is with the good soules whiche ben puryfyed. And another sayd Alexander was wnto to chastyse all men / and now he is chastysed. And an∣other sayd the kynges were wont to drede hym. And now the moost poorest man of all the worlde dredeth hym not. And than another sayd / yesterdaye all the erthe suffysed not to Alexander / and now the lengthe of his body suffyseth hym. And another
sayde Alexander myght here yesterdaye and noo body durst speke ayenst his wyll & now euery mā may spe∣ke and he hereth not. And another sayd the more that the state of kynge Alexander was gretter & more ex∣cellent the more is thoccasyon of his deth greuous & pytefull. Another sayde tho that sawe not yesterdaye Alexander fered hym gretely & now tho yt se hym fere hym not. Another sayd Alexander was he whose ene∣myes durst not come nere hȳ / & now his frendes dys∣preyse & wyll not se hym. And whan alexander began to reygne he was but .viij. yere of age / and he reygned xvii. yere of ye whiche he employed .ix. yeres in batayl & in conquerynge and .viii. yere he restyd hȳ visytynge the groundes & landes yt he had conquered / & he had victorye vpon .xxiii. mane of langages / & in two yeres he sought all thoryent & occydent, & the nombre of his knyghtes were commynly of his retenew / & at his wages .CCC.xiii. thousande without yomanrye and other men necessary to his warres. And he deyed in ye age of .xxxv. yeres & he was of sangweyn colour his face full of pockys. One of his eyen graye & yt other black / small & sharpe teth / vysage lyke a lyon / & was of grete strength & loued moche warres fro his chyld hode vnto his lyues ende. And he cōmaunded that the people sholde worshyp god & kepe them from synne. ¶ And sayd the worlde is not susteyned but comynly by scyence. & the realmes be not dyrected but by ye sa∣me / & all thynges be gouerned by reason. ¶ And sayd sapyence is messagyer of reason. And it befell yt Alexā∣der passed thrugh a towne wherin .viii. kynges had reygned afore / & he axed yf ony of theyr kynrede was alyue & they of the twone sayde ye / a sone of one of the
sayde kynges / & Alexander desyred to se hym / and the people sayd to Alexander that he was euer in ye chyr∣cheyerde. And Alexander wente to se hym / & axed of hym wherfore he abode so in the thyrcheyerde & why he wolde not take vpon hym suche estate as his fader had & his auncestres as other men doo seynge that it was the wyll of all the people. And the yonge chylde answered & sayd. O ryght boūteuous kynge I haue here a thȳg to do ye whiche whā I haue done it I shal do thy cōmaundement to whom than Alexāder axed what thȳge it was that he had to do there. And he an¦swered I am sechynge the bones of my fader & myn aūcestres kynges for to put them a part fro the other but I fynde them all so semblable that I can not kno∣we one from the other. Than sayd Alexander to hym Thou oughtest to acquyre worshyp in this worlde / & yf thou haddest good & stronge corage thou myghtest haue all thy faders good & of thy predecessours & all theyr honours. To whom ye yonge chylde answered and sayd I haue good herte. And alexāder axed hym wherin / & he sayd bycause that I haue founde lyfe wt out deth yougth without age / ryches without pouer∣te Ioye without trouble and helthe without sekenes. Certaynly sayd Alexander of all these thynges haue I none. Than sayd the chylde yf ye wyll haue them axe them of hym that hath them & he maye gyue thē & none other. Than alexander sayd that he hadde ne∣uer seen man of so grete dyscrecyon. Alexander vsed euery daye to be in a certayn place for to here the com∣playntes of euery body. And it was soo that vpon a daye onely that there came none to complane vnto hȳ and therfore he wolde not that daye sholde be put in ye
nombre of the dayes of his reygne & whan he was re∣dy to fyght with kynge dayre it was tolde hym that the same Dayre had wt hym more than .CCC. thou∣sand good fyghtȳge men. Wherto he answered & sayd a good cooke ought neuer to be abasshed to se in his kechyn many shepe amonge other bestes / & the patry∣arkes & prelates that were for that tyme came & sayd to hym god hath gyuē to the lordshyp vpon many re∣almes regyons & coūtres to thentente that thou shol∣dest haue many chyldren begoten of thy body for to haue the successyon of the same after thy deth & ther∣fore it were good yt thou sholdest haue many wyues. To whom he answered that it sholde torne hym to gret shame that had ouercome all the myghtyest men of the world for to be dyscomfyted by women. There came to hym a poore man well and wysely spekynge whiche was poorly arayed. To whō Alexander sayd I haue meruayl yt thy clothynge is not after thy spe∣che for there is bytwene them grete dyfference. Thā the poore man sayd. O myghty kynge I may of my selfe lerne to speke & to haue reason with me / and ye may resonably cloth me. Than Alexander made hym to be clothed wt one of his best gownes. ¶ Also there passed a theef byfore Alexander that was goynge to be hanged whiche sayd. O worthy kȳge saue my lyfe for I repente me sore of my mysdedes. Than Alexan∣der cōmaūded that he sholde be hanged whyle he had good repentaunce. ¶ Also vpon a tyme one axed of hym .x. pyeces of gold. To whom Alexander sayde / yu art not worthy to haue so moche / and he sayd to hym agayn. Syr yf I am not worthy to haue so moche yet are ye able to gyue it me. And Alexander axed of ary∣stotell
what thynge a good and a manly kynge ought contynuelly to do. And he answered that he ought to thynke euery nyght to the good gouernaunce of his people and the daye folowynge to put it in effecte. And it was axed of hym what thynge is moost delec∣table in conquerynge of landes and of countrees / and he sayde the moost delectacyon was to gyue largely and recompense them that haue done good seruyce to hym. ¶ And he axed of Arystotell by what meaae hy sholde be counseyled and he answered and sayde / ordeyne vpon the gouernement of thy housholde hym that haht many seruauntes and subgettes and can well rule and gouerne them / and make procurour & receyuour of thy money that hath grete lyuelode and spēdeth dyscretely and notably. ¶ And a patryarke axed of hym what he wolde do with so many men as he had. And he answered I that am lorde of them that ben great and myghty lordes maye well forbere to be lorde of theyr seruauntes. And there came two men before hym dyfferent of opynyons to whom he sayde. The sentence that shall please that one shall displease that other / and therfore consente ye to the trouth and that shall please you bothe. And it was axed of hym why he worshypped more his mayster thā his fader and he answered for as moche as I ha∣ue of my mayster euerlastȳge lyfe / and I haue of my fader lyfe but for a certaȳ tyme. And whā dayres dou¦ghters were taken it was tolde hȳ yt they were ryght fayre & therfore he wolde not se them ferynge to haue done ony dyshonest thynges sayenge that greate dys∣honour were vnto hym that had ouercome soo many notable & manly men in the bataylles yf he sholde be
ouercome by women beynge in his prysons. And it byfelle yt one made a longe sermon before hȳ whiche noyed moche to Alexāder wherfore he sayd the predi∣cacōn is not to be lauded yt endureth ouer the powre herkeners / but yt is good yt ēdureth after ye possybilyte of them yt hereth it. And it was axed of hȳ how men myght acquyre the loue of other men. and he answe∣red in doynge them good or elles at lest in doynge thē none harme. ¶ And sayd men somtyme throue better by theyr enemyes than by theyr frendes. And it was axed of hym how he myght be so myghty cōsyderȳge that he was so yonge of age / & he sayde for as moche as I haue trauayled to acquyre frendes and gyuē to myn enemyes & by this maner I haue power vpon them all. ¶ And sayd it is a grete losse to a man to lose his frendes & more than to lese his sone or his tresour ¶ And sayd the frendes that be acquyred by good de∣dys ben better than tho that ben acquyred by force / & vpon a tyme as Alexander wente to sporte hym pry∣uely certayn men beynge at a wyndowe keste water vpon hym wenynge that he had ben one of theyr fe∣lowes / & whan they saw that it was Alexander they were gretly aferd / & Alexāder bad them be not afred sayenge that they had wette none but hym that they thought to wete. And as arystotell taught many kȳ∣ges sones with Alexāder he axed ones of one of them what shalt thou gyue me whā yu shalt be a kynge the whiche sayd I shall make the my grete gouernour & in lyke wyse he axed of an other / whiche sayd I shall gyue to the halfe my realme. & than he axed of Alexan¦der / whiche answered hym thus Maystre enquere of me no this day vpon that that I haue to do to morow
for whan I shall fe yt I neuer saw I shal thynke that I neuer thought but yf I reygne as thou sayst than I shall doo as thou shalt se & thynke to be couenable / & than Arystotell sayd to hym / certaynly I wot well that thou shalte be a graete & a myghty kynge for thy face & thy nature sheweth it so. Alexander sayd to one that longe had ben his lyeutenaūt & had neuer rebu∣ked hym of no vyce I am nothynge pleased with thy seruyce. Why syr sayd his lyeutenaunt. Bycause sayd alexander yt I am a man as another & erre & haue er∣red many a tyme syth thou came in my seruyce and yu sawest neuer no fawte in me / therfore thou art not su¦che as I ought to haue to be my lieutenaūt for thou art not wyse yf thou hast seen & knowen my fawtes & not correcte me therof thou art not trewe to me. And he sayd reasō letteth not to acquyre scyence but slouth disprayseth it. And some axed of a wyseman called ny¦chomake what was the cause that mē obeyed so lygh¦tely to Alexander. And he sayd bycause that he was vertuous / that he had well kepte Iustyce / & had ben of good conuersacyon and of ryght excellent gouerne∣ment. And there were two men whiche axed euerych of them to haue to his wyfe ye doughter of a ryche mā of whiche two one was ryche & the other poore / & the fader gaue the doughter to the poore man / wherfore alexander axed of hym why he dyd so and he sayde by cause the ryche is ignoraunt & lyke to become a poore man / & ye poore is wyse & able to become a ryche man Alexander axed of a wyse philosopher by what mea∣ne the realme were well dyrected and holded in good estate / & he answered by obeysaūce of the people and the Iustyce of the kynge. And as alexander fought
ones in batayll many womē came in the same batayl ayenst hym than he withdrewe hym hastely & sayde to his mē yf he shold haue vyctory of this batayl whe¦re these women ben it were no worshyp to vs / and yf they had the victory than it were to vs a {per}petuall sha¦me wherfore we shall not fyght ayenst them whyle ye women ben there. ¶ And sayd it is a peryllous thyn∣ge a man to abyde so longe in the see that the storme & tempest come vpon hym ye may well departe duryng the fayre weder In lyke wyse it is of them that dwel in prynces & kynges houses. ¶ And sayd it is a foule thynge to a man to haue grete wordes without effect & it is a fayre thynge to hym that put his werkes be¦fore his wordes. ¶ And sayd ye greattest & moost lau∣dable lyberte that is to a man is to kepe hym fro coue¦tyse. And whan his fader commaunded hym that he sholde gladly here the cōmaundementes of his may∣ster. Tholome He sayde he wolde not onely here them but he wol¦de fulfyll them wt glad her∣te to his power. ¶ And sayd it is worse a mā to haue de∣faute of discrecyon than of rychesses. Tholom was a ryght wyseman & well vn¦derstanden & in especyall in foure scyences yt is to wytte geometrye / musike arysme¦tryke / & astrologye / and he made many good bokes a∣monge ye whiche one is cal∣led

And he ly∣ued .lxxviij. yere. ¶ And sayd he is wyse that dyspo∣seth his tongue to speke of god / & he yt knowketh hym not is the moost foole of all. ¶ And sayd he that is en∣clyned to his wyll is nygh to the Ire of god / & the ne∣rer yt a man approcheth the deth the more he ought to laboure and trauayll to do wel. ¶ And sayd sapyē∣ce abydeth no lenger in the hert of a foole than a fleyn∣ge thynge that maye not tarye in noo place. ¶ And sayd good wytte and good dyscrecyon ben felowes. ¶ And sayd a man of good sapyence can not dye / ne a man of good vnderstandynge can neuer be poore. ¶ And sayd sapyence is a tree that wexeth grene in ye hert & fructifyeth in the tonge. ¶ And sayd beware yt thou dispute not with hym that hath no knowlege ne gyue not thy counseyll but to hym that asketh it / ne tell not thy secret but to hym that can kepe it. ¶ And sayd he that wyll lyue well ought not to kepe in his herte all his aduersytees. ¶ And sayd the mayster of a greate house hath many melancolyes. ¶ And sayde speke wysely as well for thy selfe as for all other. ¶ And sayde yf thou mayst not eschewe somtyme to be wroth at lest lete not thy wrath last longe. ¶ And sayd the ertes of good people bē the castelles and for teresses of secretes. ¶ And sayd a man yt is not to be corrected by other men may surely correcte them of theyr fautes. ¶ And sayd he yt axed coūseyl of ye wyse
man and doth there after whether it turneth hym to good or to euyll he ought not to be blamed therof. ¶ And sayde it is better a kynge to dyrecte his people than to haue grete habondaūce of knyghtes. ¶ And sayd surete putteth a waye sorowe & fere empescheth gladnes. ¶ And sayde the wordes of god auaylen not to them that haue put all theyr herte to the worlde. ¶ And sayde it is to grete folye a mā to thynke moche on the thynge yt passeth his vnderstandynge. ¶ And sayd men ben of .ii. natures som wyll neuer be cōtent howbeit that they fynde ynough / & some other seke & fynde nothynge. ¶ And sayd men cause to acquere & gete money and money is the cause to acquere men. ¶ And sayd he of the whiche the scyence excedeth his wytte may be lykened to a feble shepherde that hath agrete heepe of sheep in his kepinge. ¶ And sayd he yt hath put all his entente to his flesshely delytes is mo∣re bounde than a keytyf. ¶ And sayd the hygher that a man is exalted in his lordshyp the more greuous it shall be to hym to fall fro the same. ¶ And sayd thou∣ght is the key of certaynete. ¶ And sayde the refuses of a nygard ben better than the largesses of a prody∣gall waster. ¶ And sayd thou canst do nothynge so ac¦ceptable to god as to do well to hȳ yt hath offēsed ayēst the. ¶ And sayd yf yu wyl be wyse be not in felowshyp wt foolys / but be euer in felowshyp wt them that ben wyser than thy selfe. ¶ And sayd the soule can not be deceyued vnto ye tyme yt ye body taketh his ende. And sayd folye is ye greatest enemy yt ony body may haue. ¶ And sayd good wyll is ye foūdemēt of all good wer∣kes & good werkes is ye messagyer in the other world ¶ And sayd he yt kepeth ye good opynyon & leueth the

Assaron ASsaron sayde that a kynge in his kȳg∣dome maye be dōmaged & hurted & specyally by fyue thynges / the fyrste is by to grete dryenesse / as to be .iii. yere without rayne / the se∣conde is by expēdynge mo∣re thā his lyuelode cometh to / ye thyrde is to vse to mo∣che women wyne & huntȳg the fourthe is to be of euyll maners & of wicked condy∣cyons & also to be to cruell & vengeable / the fyfte is to haue many enemyes. ¶ And sayd the moost notable maners and condycyons & the moost profytable is to be lyberall & true of his worde. ¶ And sayd he yt is ly∣beral may not lyue amisse. the true speker may not be shamed of his spekynge / the meke & lowly man can not he hated / the sobre man can not be seke / & he that well & dylygently vnderstondeth to his besynes may neuer repente therof / & bryngeth hym to good perfec∣cyon. ¶ And sayde / a kynge or a prynce ought not to trust them that dispreyse hym ne in hym that is coue¦tous in hym that is come from grete pouertye to gre∣te rychesses in hym from the whiche he hath takē the goodes & lordshyppes in hym that hath suffred ma∣my domages & hurtes for the royall mageste & ordy∣naūce / ne in hym that hath made ony alyaunce & pro∣mysse
with his enemyes and he ought to be well wa∣re that he gyue no power to none suche as tho aboue sayde. ¶ And sayde it is an impossyble thynge that the man may kepe hym from fallynge in some faute that is exalted with a kynge in graete magnyfycence without desert. ¶ And sayde whan a wyse prynce knoweth that ony of his men hath offensed agaynst hym he ought hastely to enquere the trouth of the dede / and the quantite of his trespas / and yf it be done wylfully or by ignoraunce / and also yf he was wont to do so / and yf he be lyke to fall therin agayne / and vpon euery of the same poyntes to remedye hastely. ¶ And sayde the kynges seruauntes ought to shewe in seruynge hym theyr good vertues theyr fayth the noblesse of theyr kynrede to thentente that the kynge may better knowe them and do to euery of them as he shall haue deserued. ¶ And sayde yf a kynge lo∣ueth and cheryssheth the vntrewe and wycked men as them that ben good and true he ought not to be called kynge for he is not lyke to reygne longe. ¶ And sayde yf the kynges coūseyllours his physycyen and his confessoure deleth with other thynges than lon∣geth to theyr offyces the kynge shall contynuelly be endommaged / seke of body and of the soule / and lyke to come to a foule ende. ¶ And sayde he that sayth trouthe to his leche / and he that counceylleth with his frende and telleth hym not the trouth of his coun∣seyll / he destruyeth hym selfe. ¶ And Assaron sayd a kynge sholde not commytte to an other the besynes that is necessary to hym selfe for to doo. ¶ And Assa∣ron sayde the moost secerte counseyll of the kynge is his conscyence and his good dedys is his best tresour
And of all men the trewest is the best and the best ry∣chesses ben they that be truely & duely goten. ¶ And sayd a kynge sholde commytte his besynesses to hym that he hath proued in faythe in wytte & in good go∣uernaunce and yf he may fynde noo suche take hym that hath euer be conuersaūt with wyse men. ¶ And sayd a wyse kynge of good vnderstandynge amēdeth and auayleth moche his counseyllours. ¶ And sayde whan a kynge of good dyscrecyon hath to do two ry∣ght hasty thynges he sholde begynne at the noblest and at the moost profytable. And yf they ben bothe two of estate begynne at that whiche may best be re∣couerde in tyme comynge. ¶ And he sayd yf a kynge be mercyfull his besynes shall go well his wysedom shall auayle hym in tyme comynge yf he be trewe his people shall reioyse with hym & yf he be iuste his rey∣ne shall endure. ¶ And he sayde kynges sholde gete good renomme and other men dygnytes by good me∣sure for outrageousnes is not endurynge. ¶ And he sayd it belongeth to conquerous kynges to sette & ke∣pe good Iustyce in theyr realmes & other lorshyppes goten and howbeit that it is a greuous thynge to cō∣quere them yet it is a more greuous & more chargea∣ble thynge to kepe them well. ¶ And he sayd he that is moost complete of wytte is he that knoweth hym selfe and that departed hym not from the obeysaunce of good for what maner occasyon that cometh to hym & that contynuelly thanketh hym for the goodes that he hath sent hym. ¶ And sayde that an euyll law and the loue of a shrewe lasteth noo lenger than the sha∣dowe of a cloud. ¶ And assaron sayd that a wyseman enforceth hym to fle and withdrawe frome harme.

Legmon LEgmon was bor∣ne in Ethyope & lerned his scyence in the lande of Asteyn in the ty∣me of kynge dauid ye pro∣phete / & was bought by∣a Iewe for an esclaue or bondmā for .xxx. marcke & his maystres maystre played gladly at dyse / & there ran byfore his may¦stres gate a ryuer / & on a tyme as his maystre and an other man playde at dyse / they leyde & set an owche to pledge that who of them loste a game sholde do the wyll of the wynner or he sholde drynke all the water that ran & passed afore his gate / so it happened that his maystre lost & that other cōmaunded hym yt he sholde do holy his commaundement & the loser an¦swered that he was redy to be at his iugement. Thā he sayd to hym / thou shalte gyue me all ye good yt thou hast of ony valewe or thou shalte drynke all the water
of this ryuer. And he that hath lost demaunded one∣ly respyte of one daye for tauyse hym / that other graū¦ted it to hym & thus he abode in his hous ryght pen∣sefe and full of tought how he myght escape fro this peryll / & as he was in this thought legmon his boū∣deman & seruaūt came home & brought vpō his neck a butchen of wood & salewed his mayster the whiche gaue hȳ no answer for the thought yt he was in / how be it he was acustomed for to raysone hym for ye good wordes that he founde in hym / & than legmon sayd to hym maystre who hath angred or greued the and he answered nothynge agayne / & legmon sayd mayster tell me the cause of this sorow & wo / for I shall lygh∣tely remedye it yf I may. And thā his mayster reher∣ced to hym all the fayte as is sayd afore. And thā leg∣mon sayd to hym that he sholde in no wyse abasshe hȳ for he wolde gyue hym good coūseyll. Thou shalt de∣maunde hym sayd he yf yu shalt drynke that the ryuer conteyneth now this present tyme / or elles all that ye shall renne & come cōtynuelly / & I wote well he shall saye that thou shall drynke all that it conteyneth now & whan he hath so sayd thou shalt say to hym that he stoppe and make the ryuer to stande without rennyn∣ge ony more & that thou arte redy to drynke it that it holdeth now & thus thou shalt wynne thy cause whā the mayster herde the counseyll of his boundman he was moche recomforted & in lyke wyse on the morne he sayd to hym that had wōne ye owche & in this wy∣se he escaped from the peryll. And fro than forthon he a franchysed legmon & made hym fre that afore was bounde & thrall & he dyde gyue hym moche good / and was reputed for ryght a wyse man. And one of his fe¦lowes
of tyme past mette hym on a tyme & demaun∣ded of hym arte thou not he that were wonte to kepe shepe wt me / & he answered yes / how sayd that other who hath set the in this estate. I shall tell ye sayd leg∣mon sayenge of trouth to be trewe & not tentend vpon vnprofytable thynges. And it was sayd a voys ap∣pered to hym whiche sayde to hym. Wylte thou be a grete lorde vpon the erthe / & he answered yf god wyll I wyll obeye hym but yf he wyll me gyue the choyse & my pleasure. I wyl peas. One axed hȳ wherfore he wolde not be a kynge / he answered yf I Iuge ryght¦fully I may not eschewe the hate of many men / & yf I dissimyle I shall withdrawe me fro the waye of pa¦radyse I had leuer haue in this worlde suffysaūce wt pouerte & wynne the blysse of that other worlde than for to lose to be hyghe reysed in this worlde. And Da∣uid was in a place where moche people spake a mon∣ge whom legmon was styll and he demaunded hym wherfore spekest not thou as other do. He answered bycause there is no word good but of god nor no good scylence but to thynke on god. ¶ And this Iewe that was mayster of legmon gaue hym moche good that whiche he dystrybuted in almesse / & lente it to poore nedy people wtoute vsure / & therfore god multyplyed his goodes gretely. And it is sayd he lefte all his ry∣chesses and made hym selfe a recluse in a temple soly∣tayrely vnto his deth / and there prechyd many fayre thynges & wysedomes to his sone. ¶ And sayde sone take abstynence & restreyne thy wyll for yf thou prey∣se the worlde and the dyuerse aduentures that dayly comen in doyenge offences in thynges defēded of god thou desyrest but deth / therfore enforce the to eschewe

he doth well & commaundeth other to do the same he defendeth euyll & kepeth hym selfe fro doynge it and that lyeth in his herte the tonge pronoūcheth and his dedys ben accordȳg to his wordes. ¶ Sone vnderstā¦de wysdom & exercyce the same without thynkynge on other thynges for whan thou haste goten it yu shalt be euer in Ioye & know that it is not goten but by de∣bonaryte & by good kepynge of the tongue for the ton∣gue is the dore of the almerye of sapiēce wherin euery man may well entre / yf it be not shette / and therfore men shold kepe wel the key / that is to saye the tongue more besili thā his gold or siluer. ¶ Sone lose not thȳ owne thynges for kepȳge of straūge thynges for thy propre thȳges ben thy goodes whiche thy soule shall bere with hym. And the rychesses yt shall abyde after thy dethe shall come to other mē. Sone honoure wyse¦dom and denye it not to them that desyre it & shewe it not to them that despayse it. Sone who yt hath mer∣cy on other shall haue mercy on hym selfe. Sone be yu content with that thou hast without coueytynge of ye goodes of other / or of that whiche thou knowest thou mayst not haue. Sone receyue pacyently the wordes of correccyon and of prechynge though they be hard & greuous. ¶ And he sayde ryght vnhappy is he yt he∣reth & vnderstandeth not / & yet he is more vnhappy that hereth & vnderstandeth and no thynge profyteth to hym. Sone accompanye ye with them that god lo∣ueth. Sone yelde thankynges to our lorde god of the goodes that he hath made the to receyue in humylyte & departe thē to those that be nedy. Sone yf thou ha∣ue done ony good yt ye semeth good / gyue no laude ne presynge to thy selfe therof. For yu wotest not yf god
be pleased with all or not. In euery werke is comyn∣ly some thynge euer contrary an the aduersary of the werke is proude hye thought. Sone coueyte not the delytes of this worlde but onely them that may ma∣ke the nygh to god. Sone truste thou veryly in god and loue them that obeye hym and haue them in hate that disobey hym. Sone there is no thynge more ac∣ceptable to god than good vnderstādynge and that is in ten condycyons. That is to wete in not preysynge hym selfe in well doynge in beynge content of thyn∣ges necessary to the lyfe to gyue of his goodes for god¦des sake / to wyll worshyp to hym selfe / to kepe hym selfe from doynge shamefull thynges In getynge scy¦ence and connynge all the dayes of his lyfe / to kepe hym selfe from angre. In gyuynge his loue to all thē that desyre it / and to repute hym selfe worst and the other better / for the men ben of two maners / some bē good and some ben bad / wherfore a man sholde hum∣ble and meke hym to both / to the good in prayēge god to make hym semblable and lyke to hym / to the euyll for as moche as it is not knowen whether his good∣nes is in hym hyd / and he wyll not shewe it by vayn∣glory and in doynge these thynges is a man reputed for sage and wyse. Sone worshyp god and praye hȳ that he wyll kepe the from hauynge an euyll wyfe / & he wyl teche & enforme her / for there is none other re∣medie. Sone shewe to other suche as thou hast lerned ne felawshyppe ye not with shrewes that thou be not one of them / and haue thou not affyaunce in the hous where ye people lyue this daye & deye to morow. So∣ne enhabyte thy selfe with the wysemen contynuelly For god enlumyneth theyr hertes by wordes of sa∣pyence
in suche wyse as the goodes vnder erthe ben moysted by rayne & with dewes. And some men saye yt Legmon is buryed in a twone called Carauall by∣twene ye mesquyte & ye marche. And ther ben buryed .lxx. prophetes that dyed after Legmon / ye whiche the chyldren of Israel kepte so longe in hostage that they dyed for hunger / & whā Legmō was nyght his deth he wepte sore & his sone axed hym why he wepte for fere of deth or for sorow that he had to leue the worlde he answered I wepe for none of tho two thynges but I wep by cause I haue a waye for to go frō whiche I sawe neuer man come agayne / & I bere but lytell vy∣tayll wt me & am charged wt many grete charges & I wote neuer whether I shall be aleged & discharged or no whan I shall come to thende of my way & he sayd to his sone. Sone thou oughtest to drede god & not o∣nely to be worshypped of men. Sone whan thou co∣mest in a place where shall be spokē of god abyde ther¦for yf thou be a fooll yu mayst be amended and become wyse yf thou be wyse yu shalte encrece thy wysedome / & yf god sende them ony good yu shalte haue thy parte. But & yf thou haunte places where god is not spoken of all the contrary shall happen to the. Sone be afrede of the vengeaunce of our lorde as moche as yu mayest & drede hym & consydre his ryght grete puyssaunce & myght. ¶ And sayd in lyke wyse as in gyuynge large¦ly a man maketh of his enemy his frende ryght so by pryde a mā maketh of his frende his enemy. ¶ And sayd the worde sheweth the wysedome of the mā and therfore ought a mā to be well auysed what he sayth ¶ And sayde a trewe man resteth in his trouth & the rewarde of a lyer is that he be not byleued of that he
reherceth. ¶ And sayd reherce ne tell no thynge to hȳ that wyll not byleue the ne demaunde not that thyn∣ge that thou wotest well shall not be graunted to the ne promyse no thynge but thou mayst and wylte hol∣de & kepe. ¶ And sayde thou oughtest aboue all thyn∣ge flee the companye of a lyer / and yf thou maye not eschewe his cōpanye at lest beware that chou byleue no thynge that he sayth. ¶ And sayde sone set the not in the hyest place / for it is better that thou be taken vp from the lowest place for to sytte in the hyest / than to be taken from the hyest and than be sette all bynethe. ¶ And sayd sone ones I commaunde the that thou drede god aboue all thynges for that thynge is ryght¦full and profytable to the and do so that all thy thou¦ghtes be alwaye in hym and thy wordes semblably / for the spekynge and thynkynge in god surmounteth all other wordes and thoughtes as he hym selfe sur∣mounteth all other creatures and therfore men ought to obeye hym / not withstandynge ony other thynge that they be cōstrayned to. Sone make thy oraysons and prayers duely to hym. For prayer is a shyp that is in the see / for yf she be good she shall be saufe and all that be therin / and yf she be euyll she shall perysse and all they that be therin. ¶ And sayde a man may lyghtly fynde his lyuynge and his necessytes in this world / whiche is a lytell durynge as to vs creatures but a man sholde purneye hym of thȳges necessaryes for to bere with hym whan he shall departe hens. ¶ And sayd how may a man make another to chaun¦ge his wyll that can not refrayne his owne wyl? ¶ And sayd goddes wyll is one of the goodes wher∣of god is seruyd and gladly to here thynges louable /
is to him agreable / and a curtoyse answer ought mo∣che to be preysed. yf thou behoueth to sende ony mes∣sage or legacyon sende a wyseman and yf thou mayst none fende go thy selfe. ¶ And sayd byleue not hym that lyeth to the of another man for he shall lye in lyke wyse to an other man of the. ¶ And sayd / it is more lyght to chaunge montaygnes from one place to ano∣ther than for to make hȳ vnderstande yt hath none en∣tendement. ¶ And sayd doo not that of whiche thou sholdest haue shame to se another do it. Two pacyen∣tes ben in this worlde of whiche one is he that seeth & endureth pacientely that he hateth and that other is to refrayne his wyll. There ben thre estates of men that ben knowen but in thre maners that is to wete ye pacyent is not knowen but in his aduersyte and in his Ire / ye valyaūt man is not knowen but in warre And the frendes be not knowen but in necessyte. Of all other maners and condycyons the worst is a man to be suspycyons of his frende and to dyscouer thyn∣ges secrete / to haue truste & affyaunce in euery man to speke ouermoche of thynges vnprofytable and to be in daunger of euyll people for couetyse of goodes temporall. ¶ And sayd the thought is ye myrour of ye man wherin he may beholde his beaute & his fylth. ¶ And he sayd beware and kepe the for to be suspecy∣ous for suspeccyon taketh away the loue fro the peo∣ple. wytte without doctryne is a tree without fruyte ¶ And sayd for to be ioyous and to salewe euery man gladly to be lyberall in gyuynge and receyuynge and to for gyue gladly his euyll wyll make a man to belo∣ued of eche body.
Anese ANeyse the philoso∣pher sayth. Whan men wexe olde theyr ver∣tues ben dispraysed and the ryche men ben more ferfull than poore men. ¶ And he sayde the noble deth is better than a vyle domina∣cyon. ¶ And sayde the most and grettest ewre or hap of a man is to haue a good fe∣lawe / nowe than accom∣panye the with good peo∣ple and thou shalte be one of them. One of the gret∣test vylonyes and iniquytes of the worlde is for to do vylonye vnto an impotent persone. ¶ And sayde yf thou hast done ony trespas or synne / repente the ano∣ne without abydynge vnto the morne. ¶ And he sayde thou oughtest to gyue hym thanke that doth ye good of what condycyon that he be of so that he do it lyberally and in good entente. ¶ And sayde he may not knowe ne apperceyue many thynges that canne not apperceyue ne knowe hym selfe. ¶ And sayde / yf thou wylt haue endurynge longe with an other put thy selfe in payne to enforme hym in good maners. ¶ And sayd yf a kynge be iuste and ryghtfull he shall seygnorie and be lorde ouer the corage of his people / yf he be other wyse though he be named for kynge yet wyll they haue theyr corages to another.
Sacdarge SAcdarge sayth yt ye werkes of this worlde ben adressed by two thynges / one is by scyence of whiche ye soule is adressed and that other is besenes of whiche the soule & ye body ben adres∣sed. ¶ And sayde men le∣ue for to do moche har∣me and euyll whan they doubte and fere our lorde. ¶ And sayde / noblesse of lygnage is moche coue∣nable to receyue scyēce ye entencyō of the man sholde be for to refrayne his cou∣rage frome fylth and foule thynges / for the good lyfe maketh the good renommee and causeth a good eude / he is ryght excellēt whiche is honorable in all his dis∣portes and of whom the wytte surmounteth the Ire ¶ He sayd let it suffyse to the to be soo wyse that thou canst doo well and kepe the from doynge euyll. Ther is no thynge soo euyll vnto a man as to be euyll endo∣ctryned / and in especyall whan he is yssued of noble and good lygnage. ¶ And sayd for to conne scyence it is a moche honourable and profytable thynge. For by it goodes of this worlde and of that other ben go∣ten. Awyse man wyll no thynge haue of his prynce but that whiche he hathe goten by sayenge trouth & by his good werkes. ¶ And sayd he is a good lorde yt taketh vpō hym payne to kepe his subgectes in suche wyse as he kepeth his owne body and that he be not
so rygorous and oppressynge that them behoueth to leue his lordshyp. And that also he be not to them so debonarye that they dyspyse his maundementes. ¶ And he sayd the moost curteys gyuer is he that gy¦ueth without axynge. ¶ And sayd In what someuer place thou be with thyn enemy be it in dysporte or o∣therwyse / make alwaye good watche on thy selfe / thought so be thou be strōger than he and myghtyer yet labour alwaye to make peas. ¶ And sayd in lyke wyse as it is grete payne to the body of a man to su∣steyne thynge that is impossyble to hym ryght so it is a greuous thynge to a wyseman for to teche a foole. ¶ And sayd a suspecyous man may neuer haue good lyfe. ¶ And sayd he is ryght ignoraunt and vnkynde that can not gyue thankynge for the goodnes that is done to him / but yet he is more vnkynde that denyeth it to other. ¶ And sayd he that demaundeth but rea∣son Thesylle is able to vaynquysse & ouercome his enemye. THesylle sayde / thou oughtest to loue bet∣ter the rude wordes that bē proufytable and true than the swete wordes that ben of deceyte and flaterynge. Some men put venym in swete drynkes & ye medecy∣nes that sonest heleth peo∣ple are bytter and of eull sa∣uoure. ¶ And sayde / it is a
foule thynge to be so curyous for the fedynge of the bo¦dy that it hurteth both it and the soule. ¶ And sayde as a shypmā taketh not the see without he seeth that he hath a couenable wynde / no more sholde a man dis∣pose hym to ony maner werkes without it were coue¦nable for the soule. ¶ And sayde thou oughtest to do that / that is moost profytable for the body and rather rhat / that is moost couenable for thy soule / and not to do the contrarye. ¶ And sayd he that can well coun∣seyll another ought to counseyll well hym selfe & ha∣ue remembraunce to the saluacyon of his soule for it is a greate vyce to a man to worshyppe and helpe an∣other and dysworshyppe and hurt hym selfe. ¶ And sayde as it becometh euyll a man that hath a foule & vnclene body to be clothed with cloth of golde or with cloth of sylke / ryght so it is a foule thȳge to haue gre∣te beaute of body and of vysage and be full of euyl wer¦kes. ¶ And sayde we ought by reason to kepe clenely our bodyes we are more specyally bounde to kepe ho∣nestly and well that that gyueth vs knowlege of our lorde god that is the wysedome of the soule and not to hurte or ouercome it with meetes or drynkes. And it was axed of hym how a man myght kepe hym from Ire. And he answered in remembrynge that it is im∣possyble yt he sholde alway be obeyed but that he must somtyme obeye and that he shall not alwaye cōmaun∣de but he shall be cōmaunded. And also that god seeth all thynge & yf he hath this in consyderacyō he sholde not longe be worthe. ¶ And he saw a grete fatte man to whom he sayd thou paynes the sore to breke ye wal¦les of thy pryson. ¶ And sayd whā thou shalt correcte nother shewe it not lyke hym that wold venge hym
of his enemy / but do as the physycyan that curioyse∣ly speketh to his pacyent. And whan thou shalt correc¦te thy selfe shewe the as the hurte man doth to his leche∴ Saynt Gregoyre SAynt Gregoyre sayd recommaunde to god the begynnȳge and the ende of all thy werkes. ¶ And sayde / studye and trauayll to knowe all thynges and reteyne and holde with the those that ben moost prou∣fytable. ¶ And sayde po¦uerte is euyll but rychesse is moche worse. ¶ And sayde be thou pacyent and & haue reasō in thy wrath & lygh thy selfe wt sapiēce ī ste¦de of candell / and presume not to be better than thou art but thynke thou art dedely / repute the for a straū∣ger and thou shalte worshyppe the straūgers. ¶ And sayd whan thy shyp shall be laden wt grete transquil∣lyte than yu oughtest fere to be drowned. ¶ And sayde man ought to receyue merely all that god sendeth thē ¶ And sayde the hattered of good men is better than the loue of euyll people. ¶ And sayde frequente and haunte the companyes of wysemen and not of the ry∣che. ¶ And sayde dysprayse not a lytell of good thyn∣ges for they may gretly encresse and amende. ¶ And sayde endure pacyently without takynge vengaun∣ce.
Galyen GAlyen was one of ye. viij. leches ryght ex∣cellet in medycyne / whiche were all .viij. su{per}latyf abo∣ue all other leches of ye whi∣che the fyrst was Esculapi{us} the seconde Gorius. the thyr¦de Mirius. the fourthe pro∣medines. the .v.

CCCC. volumes of bokes amonge whiche there ben viii. that ben studyed in fuche thynges as men desy∣re to lerne of the art of medicine / his fader was ryght dylygent to put hym to the scole and spended moche good vpon hym and sente hym in the countre of Asye in the cyte of Pargame Athenes Rome and Alexan∣drye for to fynde the best maysters / and there he ler∣ned phisyke / geometrye / gramarye / & other scyences / & he lerned phisyke of a woman called cleopatre whi∣che taught hym many good herbes and profytable to all maner of sykenesse / & he dwelled longe in Egypte for to knowe all these herbes / and longe after he dyed nyghe ye cyte of Escam fast by the grene see in ye mar∣ches of Egypte / & in his youthe he desyred gretely to knowe ye scyence demonstratyue & he was so enclyned to lerne it that whan he departed from the scole with
other chyldren his mynde was euer vpon that that his mayster had taught hȳ / wherof his felowes moc¦ked him & axed hym why he wolde not playe & sporte hym with them. To whom he sayd I take as grete pleasaunce to recorde my lesson as ye do youre playes wherof his sayd felawes had grete meruayll & sayde that his fader was happy to haue suche a chylde / & to put hym to the scole / that so well loued wysedome / his fader was a grete labourer / his graūt fader was a souerayn maystre carpenter / & his graunsyrs fader was an harper & meter of landes whiche is ye scyen∣ce of geometrye. Galyen was at Rome in the reygne of kynge Octauyen whiche reygned after Adryen & there he made a booke of anascomye and many other traytyes. Some say yt grete parte of his bookes were brent / and amonge them some of Arystotelles bookes wrytten with his hand & of Danagoras & of Andro∣mache / & a booke that he had made of tryacles for ve∣nyms / & thaught ye kynge of Grece to breke the hylles & fylle the valeyes & to make playne wayes in theyr countres & edyfyed cytees & closed them with bygge walles / & also to make ryueres renne trugh the two∣nes & in other places where nede was & to do al other thynges that were to the commyne profyt. And in those dayes they hadde more delectacyon & pleasaun∣ce to the good rule & gouernaunce of theyr lordeshyp than to the ease and pleasaūce of theyr owne bodyes. And theyr hertes were moche sette to haue good vni∣uersytees and scoles of grete clerkes and specyally in physyke. And also they ordeined in euery countre and regyon certayn folkes to gader herbes and to brynge them to the maystres of physyke for to preue them by
experyence. And the same herbes thus approued we∣re sent to the kynges closet & sealed with theyr seales to thentent that they sholde not be chaunged and than the kynges ordeyned them for seke folkes. ¶ And the sayd Galyen sayd wysdome can not profyte to a foole ne wytte to hym that vseth it not. ¶ And sayd heuy∣nesse cometh of the thynges passed & thought of thyn∣ges to come. ¶ And Galyen was foure score yere and vii. whā he sayd that many grete lordes be Ignoraūt whan they be more enclyned to haue fayre horses and ryche gownes & other Iewelles than to wynne good fame by good condycyons. ¶ And sayde ye physycyēs were wont to haue lordeshyp & to gouerne seke folkes & to cause them to do suche thynges as were moost ex¦pedyent and proufytable for theyr helth / and no seke man durst dysobeye his physycyen but shold be com∣pelled to obeye hym wherfore they were the soner re∣couered and hole / & now the leches ben subgectes to ye seke folkes / & be cōpelled to handell them easely and softly & gyue them swete drynkes though it auayleth them but lytell / & therfore is there the more sekenesse & lēger vnhelth. ¶ And sayd somtyme tho that were moost sobre in theyr metes and lest dranke wyne we∣re best byloued and moost praysed / & nowe the moost glottons / and tho that oftenest ben dronken are the moost sette by and the rather set at grete lordes bour∣des whiche gyueth euyll exāpell to other. ¶ And sayd thou mayest well instructe all men saue onely those that be withoute shame. ¶ And sayde / a man that knoweth well hym selfe hath power ynough to corre¦cte hym selfe. ¶ And sayde a man may loue hym selfe so moche that he is deceyued thereby for we se many
that wene and seme to be good and are contrary. ¶ And sayde he is iuste that may bothe doo ryght or wronge & yet kepe Iustyce. And he is wyse & dyscre∣te that knoweth that / that suffyseth to be knowen & that doth vertuousely to euery creature. ¶ And sayd lyke as a seke man desyreth not to departe frome his phisycyentyll he hath recouered his helth whiche he coude not do by hym selfe / in lyke wyse a man ought to desyre the company of a confessoure for the helth of his soule. ¶ And he saw a mā that was gretly made of and cherysshed with kynges for the strength of his body of whome he sayd parauenture I shall cause hȳ to repente it at laste∴ Protege IT was asked of one called Protege wher∣fore it was that one of his neyghbours made dye his here in blacke he answered bycause no man sholde aske to lerne sapyence of hym∴ ¶ And plures sayde the mo∣re good that a foole hath the more he is foole. And it was axed of one arystan whan it was good to lye with a woman he answered at all tymes whan a man wyll hurt enpayre & feble his body. And it was axed of Di¦mycrates wherby he knewe and perceyued best his wytte / he answered in that yt I thynke I vnderstan∣de
and knowe but lytell. ¶ And sayd / the wyseman that replyeth is better than the foole that accordeth to euery purpose. And there was a wysemā called azee that was a prysonner to whome his mayster axed of what kȳrede he was / he answered enquere not of my lygnage / but axe of my prudēce and connynge & was axed of a nother called Sygonce also prysoner of one that wolde haue bought hym wherto he was good & he answered to be delyuered. And an other axed of hȳ yf it were good that he sholde bye hym. To whom he answered I am nothynge worth but ye or some other bye me. And another sayd he dyspreyseth hym selfe that dispreyseth all other and gyueth hym selfe laude. And there was one that prayd god to kepe hym fro ye daunger of his frendes. And it was asked hym why he prayed not rather that god sholde kepe hym fro his enemyes than fro his frendes. And he answered for as moche as I may well kepe me frome mȳ enemies in whom I haue no truste / but I may not kepe me frome my frende whome that I truste. It was axed of a wiseman whiche be ye most noble worldely thyn∣ges. To whom he answered to loue sapience & to hate fooly not to be ashamed to lerne. ¶ And it was axed of Archasam whiche be the sciences that chyldren shold lerne. He answered those that cause them to hate igno∣raunce in theyr age. ¶ And it was asked of another / why he wolde haue noo syluer / & he answered for as moche as it come to men by fortune & is kepte by ny∣gardshyp & couetise & is often folyshely spent & to euyl vse. And another sayd the loue of a foole shall be more noysant to ye thā his hatered & there was a mā yt sayd to another I shall put my payn & dilygence to destroie
the. He answered & I shall enforce me to destroye thy malyce & appease thyn Ire. And ther came byfore a kynge thre wysemen the one was a greke the other a Iewe & the thyrde a sarazyn / of whome the sayd kyn¦ge desyred that eche of them wolde vtter some good & notable scyēce. Than the greke sayd / I may well cor∣recte and amende my thoughtes but not my wordes. Than ye Iewe sayd I haue meruayll of them yt sayd thynges preiudycyall where scylence were more pro∣fytable. And ye sarazyn sayd I am mayster ouer my worde or it be pronūced / but whan it is spoken I am seruaunt therto. ¶ And it was axed one of them who myght be called a kynge / & he answered he that is not subgcete to his owne wyll. ¶ And assaron sayde to an euyll payer that desyred to borow money of hym that he wolde lend hym none for he knoweth well that he coude not dysplease hym moche in refusynge the lone as in axynge him his payement agayne. ¶ And sayd the wysemen speke wt good delyberacyō / & the fooles speke without auysemēt. ¶ And teofrates sayd he is of good condycyon yt reporteth and sayth good of other folkes and kepeth secrete theyr defautes. And it was axed of discony what thynges were moost nycessary for a man to kepe hym out of other folkes daunger & he answered yf he be ryche to lyue moderatly & yf he be poore to labour dilygently. ¶ And Nicomake sayd ther is not so good a doctour as discrecyonne so good a precher as the tyme & he yt correcketh hym by other is ryght dylygent & well occupyed. And it is better to take example by other than other take it by hym. And thymetus sayd medle nor vndertake not with the go∣uernaunce of a oole / for he can not peyse nor conceyue
what good thou doost to hym / no more than an horse or other beestes take hede whether they charge hȳ wt golde or grauell.

Thenne my sayd lord desired me to ouersee it and where as I shold fynde faulte to correcte wherin I answered vn∣to his lordship that I coude not amēde it but yf I shol¦de so {pre}sume I might a paire it For it was ryght well and connyngly made and translated into ryght good and fayre englyshe / Notwythstondyng he wylled me to ouersee it and shewid me diuerse lettres myssyues sent from / Alisander to darius and / Aristotle and eche to other. Whiche lettres were lytyl appertenēt vnto to dictes & sayenges aforsayd for as moche as they spe∣cifye of other maters & also desired me that don to put ye sayd booke in emprinte. And thus obeȳg his request and comaūdement I haue put me in deuoir to ouerse this his said book & beheldē as nighe as I coude how It accordeth with thorigynal beyng in frensh. ¶ And I fynde nothynge discordaunt therin. Sauf onely in the dictes and sayenges of Socrates wherin I fyn∣de that my sayd lord hath left out certayn and diuerse conclusyons touchyng women wherof I meruaylle
that my sayd lord hath not wretō them ne what hath menyth him so to do. Ne what cause he hadde at that time. But I suppose that som fayr lady hath desireth hym to leue it out or his booke / Or ellys he was ame∣rous on somme noble lady / for whos loue he wold not sette yt in his booke. Or ellys for the very affeccyon loue and good wylle that he hath vnto all ladyes and Gentilwomen / he thought that Socrates spared the sothe. And wrote of women more than trouthe / whiche I can not thynke that so trewe a man and so noble a philozophre as Socrates was sholde wryte other wyse than trouthe / For If he had made fawte in wrytȳge of women he ought not ne shold not be be∣leuyd in his other dictes and sainges. But I apercey∣ue that my sayd lord knoweth verely that suche defau¦tes ben not had ne founden in the women borne and dwellynge in these parties ne Regyons of the world / Socrates was a Greke borē in a ferre contre frō hēs whiche cōtre is alle of other cōdicyōs thā this is And mē & womē of other nature they bē her in this contre. For I wotte well of what sōeuer condycyō women bē in Grece he womē of this cōtre bē righ good / wyse pleasant / humble / dyscrete / sobre / chaste obedyent to theyr husbondis / trewe / secrete stedfast euer besy / and neuer ydle / Attemperat in spekynge and vertuous in alle theyr werkis / or atte leste sholde be soo. For whi∣che causes so euident mi sayd lord as I suppose thou∣ghte it was not of necessyte to sette in his booke the sayengis of his / Auctor socrates touchynge women But for as moche as I had commandement of my sayde lorde to correcte and amende where as I sholde finde fawre and other finde I none saufe that he hath
lefte oute these dyctes and saynges of the women of Grece / therfore in accomplissynge his commaūdemēt for as moche as I am not in certayn wheder It was in my lordis copye or not / or ellys perauenture that ye wynde had blowe ouer the leef. At tyme of translacy∣on of his booke I purpose to wryte tho same saynges of that. Greke. Socrates / whiche wrote of tho women of Grece and nothinge of them of this Royal∣me / whom I suppose he neuer knewe. For yf he had I dare planly saie that he wolde haue reserued them in especial in his said dictes. Alway not presumȳg to put and sette them in my sayd lordes booke / but inten¦de aparte in the rehersesayll of the werkis humbly re¦quirynge all them that shall rede this lytyll rehersall that yf they fynde ony faulte tarecte it to. Socrates and not to me whiche writeth as here after foloweth. SOcrates sayde that women ben thappa∣raylles to catche men / but they take none but them that wyll be poure / or els them that knowe hem not / and he said that ther is none so grete empeshement vnto a man as Ignoraunce / and women. And he sawe a woman that bare fyre of whom he sayde that the hotter bare the colder. And he sawe a woman seke / of whome he sayd that the euill restith and dwellith with the euyl. And he sawe a woman brought to the Iustyce / and many of women folowed her wepynge / of whom he sayde the euyll ben sory and angry bycause the euyll shall perisshe. And he sawe a yonge mayde that ler∣ned to wrytte of whom he sayde that mē multypleith euyll vpon euyll. ¶ And he sayde that the Ignoraun∣ce of a man is knowen in thre thynges That is to we¦te
whan he hath no thought to vse reason. Whan he can not refrayne his couetyses. And whan he is go∣uerned by the counseyll of women in that he knoweth that they knowe not. ¶ And he sayd vnto his discy∣ples wyll ye that I ensygne and teche you howe ye shall mow escape fro all euyll and they answered ye & than he sayd to them. For what someuer thynge that it be kepe you and be well ware that ye obeye not to women. who answered to hym agayn & what sayest thou by our good moders and of our systers. He sayd to them. Suffyse you with that I haue sayd to you / for all ben semblable in malice. ¶ And he sayde who someuer wyll acquere & gete scyence late hym neuer put hym in the gouernaūce of a woman. And he saw a woman that made her fresshe and gaye to whome he sayd thou resemblest the fyere / for the more wode is leyde to ye fyere ye more wyll it brenne & the greter is the hete. And on a tyme one axed hym / what hym semed of women. He answered that the women resē∣ble vnto a tree called Edelfla whiche is the fayrest tree to beholde and that may be / but within it is full of ve¦nym. ¶ And they sayd to hym and demaunded wher¦fore he blamed so women / and that hym selfe had not comen in to this worlde ne none other men also with∣out them He answered / the woman is lyke vnto a tree named Chassoygne on whiche tree there ben many thynges sharpe and prickinge whiche hurt and pryc∣ke them that aproche vnto it / and yet neuer the lesse yt same tree bryngeth forth good dates and swete. And they demaunded hym why he fled frome the women and he answered for as moche as I see them flee and eschewe the good and comynly do euyll. And a womā
sayde to hym wylt thou haue ony other woman than me / and he answered to her. Arte thou not ashamed to offre thy selfe to hym yt demaūdeth nor desireth ye not. LO these ben the dictes & sayengis of the philo¦sophre Socrates whiche he wrote in his bok And for as moche as it is acordaunt / that his dictes & sayengis shold be had as wel as others therfore I ha¦ue sette it in thende of this book. And also somme per∣sones per auenture that haue red this bok in frensshe wold haue arette a gret defaute in me that I had not do my deuoir in visitinge and ouerseynge of mi lordes book acordynge to his desyre. And somme other also happely myght haue supposed / that Socrates hade wreton moche more euyll of women than here afore is specifyed wherfore in satisfyenge of all parties and also for excuse of the sayde sacrates I haue sette these sayd dictes & sayengis a parte in thende of this book / to thentent that yf my sayd lorde or ony other persone what someuer he or she be that shall rede or here it / yt yf they be not well plesyd with all that they with a penne race it out or ellys rente the leef out of the booke Humbly requyrynge and besechinge my sayd lorde to take no displaysir on me so presumyng but to pardone where as he shall fynde faulte / and that it plese hym to take ye labour of thenpryntynge in gre and thanke / whiche gladly I haue don mi diligence in thaccōplis∣shinge of his desire and cōmādemēt In whiche I am boūdē so to do for ye good reward yt I haue ryeseyued of his said lordship whō I beseche Almyghty god tē∣crece & to cōtin̄e ī his vertuous disposiciō ī this world And after this lyf to lyue euer lastȳgly in heuē. Amen
