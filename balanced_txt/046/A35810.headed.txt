The True Copy of a Paper delivered by the Lord De—to the Mayor of Darby, where he Quarter'd the One and Twentieth of November, 1688. WE the Nobility and Gentry of the Northern-Parts of England, (whose Names are here under written) being deeply sen∣sible of the Calamities that threaten these Kingdoms, do think it our Duty as Christians and good Subjects, to Endeavour, what in Us lies, the healing of our present Distractions, and pre∣venting greater; And as with grief we apprehend the sad Conse∣quences that may arise from the Landing of an Army in this Kingdom from Foraign Parts, So we cannot but deplore the Occasion given for it, by so many Invasions, made of late years, on our Religion and Laws. And whereas we cannot think of any other Expedient to compose our differences, and prevent effusion of Blood, then that which procured a Settlement in these Kingdoms after the late Civil Wars, the meeting and setting of a Parliament, freely and duly Chosen, We think our selves obliged, (as far as in us lies) to pro∣mote it; And the rather, because the Prince of Orange (as appears by His Declaration) is willing to submit His own Pretensions, and all other matters, to their Determination: We heartily wish, and humbly pray, That His Majesty would Consent to this Expedient, in order to a future Settlement; And hope that such a tempera∣ment may be thought of, as that the Army now on foot, may not give any interruption to the proceeding of a Parliament. But if to the great Misfortune and Ruine of these Kingdoms, it should prove otherwise, We further Declare, That we will to our utmost, defend the Protestant Religion, the Laws of the Kingdom, and the Rights and Liberties of the Subject. London, Printed for John Goodman, 1688.
