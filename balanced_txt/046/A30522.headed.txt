The Everlasting Gospel of Repentance and Remission of Sins, held forth, and declared, &c. OH IRELAND! the day of Gods visitation of Love and tender Mercy hath been upon thee, to try thee▪ and to prove thee; and the Lord would have gathered thy People into Covenant and Fellowship with himself, to live in Love, Unity and Peace, and the Lord would have made thy Inhabitants blessed, but they would not; but many have refused the Day of his Love, and they have neg∣lected his Loving-kindness, and have chosen their own wayes of Iniquity and Unrighteousness, rather than the way of Truth and Peace; though the Lord hath often smitten, and caused his Judgments to be known in the Land, and suffered great destructi∣on in dayes past, even Plague, Sword and Famine were sore up∣on thee, Have thy Inhabitants forgotten the dealings of the Lord towards thee? Are his Judgments and Mercies clean gone out of remembrance, which the Lord shewed in thee not many years since? And because of thy Iniquities and Transgressions, which were grown very great against God, he was angry with thee, and provoked against thee, and did give up thy Inhabitants to hard∣ness of heart, and cruelty of mind one against another, so that they were given up to destroy and cut off one another, and thou∣sands of them fel through the malice & wickedness of each others hearts and hands, and cruel Murders, Robberies, Treacheries, and a very great destruction was commited amongst thy People; and this was because Iniquity at that day was full, Pride and Op∣pression, Drunkenness and Whoredom, Double-dealing▪ and Preachery, and all manner of Unrighteousness was grown to the height, and therefore did the Lord suffer a very great Rebuke in the Land, and by Sword, Plague and Famine did he plead with thy Inhabitanas for some years together, even that he might humble thee and correct thee, and that thy People might turn un∣to him, and forsake their Iniquities: Oh! why hast thou forgot∣ten the dealings of the Lord, running into the same abominations!
for since the Lord stayed his Judgments, Iniquity is incre even as before; though the Lord hath given thee Rest and Peace for divers years, and healed thee of thy Sorrows and Miseries, and replenished thee with People, and this hast had Peace and Fulness for a good season, but yet thou hast not made a right use of these mercies as thou oughtest to have done; though the Lord hath shewed Love and Favour towards thee, in delivering of thee from thy former Troubles and Miseries, yet thou hast turned, to thy own hurt, his Blessings into a Curse, through thy abuse of them; and now through Rest, and Peace and Fulness, thy Inhabitants are corrupted and become abominably sinfull, and they have loaden themselves with transgressions, and heaped up wrath against the day of wrath, even wrathful matter for the wrath of God; and former Judgments and Mercies, seems to be both forgotten, many having abused them to their hurt, though the Lord intended them for their good, and thy Inhabitants are as before, many of them hardened in Iniquity, rather than turned from it; and they are turned into their old paths, and drinks of the same Cup of Abomi∣nations, and Pride, and Oppression, and all Unrighteousness in every part of it, is grown as high as ever it was in thee: Oh how doth Wickedness abound! Drunkenness, Wantonness, vain Plea∣sures, Envy, Wrath, Contention, Heart-burning, Covetousness and Earthly-mindedness, Double-dealing, False-heartedness, Idolatry and Hypocrisie, and all fruits of the Flesh, how do they abound in thee! even as high as ever before, as though thou hadst never felt Judgment, because of thy sins, and as though thou hadst never tasted of Mercy that thou shouldest live a better life; but both Judgment and Mercy by-past are neglected, and the re∣membrance of them worn out, and thou hast said in thy heart, We love this World, its Pleasures and Vanities, and after our wayes will we go. Oh Nation and Kingdom, this is thy condition, and thy present state; thou drinkest up Iniquity as an Ox drinketh water, and thou addest sin to sin, as if all thou couldst do were too little, and like as if thou wert appointed for no other end, but to commit sin; and thou hatest Reproof, and despisest Cor∣rection, and him that reproves thee, thou countest thy Enemy; for the whole pleasure of many of thy People is in sinning against
God: and thus thou thinkest to serve him with thy sins, and re∣quitest the Lord evil for his good towards thee, and his Judg∣ments and Mercies have no place in thy heart; Though yet thou hast been warned, for these divers years, that thy people should turn from their Inquities and serve the living God; Repentance and forsaking of sin hath been preached thorow thee, and warning hath been given of the Judgments of God that are to come: but hereof hast thou taken no notice as thou oughtest to have done, but thy Inhabitants have despised the Lords Servants, and perse∣cuted them, and thou hast held in derision and under great affli∣ctions the People of the Lord, and persecuted them for good Conscience-sake. And this is the fulfilling of Wickedness in thee, and the hight of thy Inhabitants Transgressions, in that they have persecuted such who have warned them, and despised the Lords Reproof, and would not hearken to the Advice of his People, but do alwayes reject the Message of Gods Light, which reproves People in their own Consciences because of Sin, that they should turn from it and be saved; this Message hath been proclaimed thorow the Land, even for some years together, wherein the Lord hath visit∣ed thee with his Love, that he might gather thy People, and con∣demn their Iniquities, and save their Souls; but thy People have rejected this Message, and would not be turned from their Idola∣trous wayes and worships, nor from the Hypocrisie of their ways, that they might be healed; but thy People have forsaken the li∣ving God, and rebelled against the Light, and the way of Peace they have refused, and turned their backs towards the Lord and not their face, and after Covetousness and the love of this World they have gone; though there hath been a great profession of Worship and Religion in thee, much Preaching and Praying, Sabbath-keeping and professed Church-fellowship, Ministry and Ordinances, and a Sect here of one sort, and there another, that have cryed, Lord, Lord, and have made a shew of Worships and Duties towards him, yet notwithstanding, Hypocrisie, False∣heartedness, Covetousness, Double-mindedness, and the spirit of Pride and Ambition, and vain Glory, have possessed the hearts of both Teachers and People, in all the false Sects and divers kinds of Religion; though they have had a shew, as if they were
the Lords People, and a pretence of Worship, and conformity of Church-fellowship, &c. yet their hearts have not been right before the Lord; but of these it may be said, even they have professed God with their mouths, and with their lips honoured him, and in the very time their hearts have gone after Covetous∣ness, and been far departed from the Lord; and though they have cryed, The Temple of the Lord, and we are the Church of Christ and Members of him, and have Gospel, and Ministry, and Ordinances; yet these people have walked in Pride and Arro∣gancy, and Covetousness, and their hearts have been Corrupted in the sight of the Most High, and all their Religion hath been but as the fig-leaves, by which they have sought to cover them∣selves, but it cannot be; For behold ye Professors and People of Ireland! God hath beheld your Hypocrisies, and the Deceitful∣ness of your hearts, and your nakedness doth appear; for though you have professed much of the Spirit, and Spiritual Things, yet you have walked in the Flesh, and brought forth the fruits there∣of, and your garments of feigned Prayers and Practices, and your profession of Church and Ordinances, will not cover nor hide you from the Wrath of the Lamb. Oh People of Ireland, many of you have been corrupted in your hearts, and polluted in your minds, and from the highest of you to the lowest, you are sound Transgressors against God, even from the Professor to the Porphane the Lord hath found no good fruit amongst you, well-pleasing to him, but four grapes and bit∣ter fruit have you brought forth, even fruit of a bad tast and loathsom smel unto the Lord; and now the Lord hath found you out in your wickedness, and the cry of your Iniquities call for Vengeance; for of you it may be said, Ah Nation laden with Iniquity! ah sinful People! a seed of Evil-doers, corrupted from the crown of the heal to the soal of the foot: these things are so, and they cannot be hid: But now the Lords purpose is to deal with thee, because of thy sins, seeing he is provoked against this Peo∣ple by their Iniquities, who have been disobedient to the living God; Therefore will he renew his Judgments of old, and with∣draw his Mercies, and he will plead with the People in his Ju∣stice: his Judgments are at the door, and he will punish the stout-hearted, and proud and arrogant, till they learn meekness
and humility; he will correct the Transgressors with his Rod of heavy Wrath, till they turn to him by Repentance; and all that will not bow and kiss the Son, and cease from evil, and learn to do well, they shall be broken and cut off and perish in his anger, and he will never heal them; even the Feller will come upon thy People, O Nation, who will hew down thy Cedars, and cut up thy strong Oaks; the Fanner is coming upon thee to sift thee, to preserve the good Grain, and to separate the Chaff into the fire; thy Strength will be made weak, and thy Crown will be toden down, and thy Beauty shall be marred, and all thy Glory and Might shall fade like a flower in that day, when the Lord of Hosts pleadeth with thee, and when he rewards thee for thy Wickedness, Then Wo unto thee, and unto all the Wicked and workers of Iniquity, and he will cause them to remember what they have done; thy Sins, O Nation, shall be set in order before thee, and thy Persecution of the Lords Servants shall be charged to thy account, and the Rod of Affliction shall reach close unto thee because thereof; and as thy Rulers have done to others, so shall it be done to them, into Captivity shall they go, and the Spoyler shall come upon the Land: for Iust is the Lord, and his Iudgments altogether equal; and though he be long-suffering and of great forbearance, yet he forgets not to plead with his Enemies, and to plague the Ungodly, nor to shew mercy to them that trust in him; And doubtles there is a Cup of Wrath prepared for the Wicked to drink, and it seemeth to be near, even a day of great Wrath & Tribulation upon Sinners and Transgressors, who have rejected the Lord, and despised his Reproofs, and would not re∣ceive the Message of the Light of the World, that they might be healed. Wherefore, Repeat, Repent all sorts of People, all Sinners and Transgressors, tremble before the Lord ye stout-hearted and re∣bellious Children; Wo unto ye unjust Rulers and Judges, that have exercised unjust Judgment in the Land, that have judged for Gifts and Rewards, and that have turned aside just Judge∣ment, Mercy and Truth, and that have persecuted the Innocent without just cause; Wo unto you that have been Oppressors of the Poor and Needy, ye that have not judged for the Lord as ye ought to have done, but have been ambitious and vain-glorious,
and puffed up in the flesh by high Titles and Places of Honour, ye that have exalted your selves above your Brethren, and sought Honour of Men, and loved the Honour of this World more than the Honour of God, Wo unto you; for the day of the Lords Judg∣ment is at hand, and an account of your Stewardship must you give: Ye that should have judged in Mercy, and Truth, and E∣quity, but have perverted just Judgment, and made the Innocent Offenders, and have not been a praise to them that do well, nor a terror to evil-doers as ye ought to have been; Wo unto you, and to the Oppressing and Falshearted Lawyers, and that Train, who have been greedy of Gain, and served your own Ends, and sought Riches to your selves, and the Cause of the Poor hath not been freely pleaded by you; Wo unto all ye that have made a Trade of doing Judgment and Justice, and have been exercised in the Laws for your own Ends, and not singly for the Lord; Tremble ye sons of Wickedness, ye that have exercised the Power of An∣tichrist and the Beast, for the Judgments of the Lord are at hand to be executed upon you. Wo unto you Great and Rich men, ye covetous and earthly Worldlings, ye that have made your selves rich by Oppression and grinding the faces of the Poor; that have got Gain by hard dea∣ling, and added Land to Land and Field to Field, and that have over-reached the Ignorant, and oppressed the Widows and Fa∣therless, and that have exercised Cruelty and hard dealing to your Tenants and Servants, and have laid heavy Yoaks upon such with whom you have dealt, and that have made your selves great and rich in the Earth by such means; Wo unto you, Misery is coming upon you, weep and howl, ye earthly greedy covetous Wretches of this World, who have sought Riches more than the Lord, and gotten Gain by Oppression and Over-reaching your Neighbours; your Riches so gotten shall never prosper nor be blessed to you, but shall be a Curse to you, and your Children and your Covetousness will God plague; Ye that have gotten Goods and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of your dayes: Wo unto you Carnal minds, all the treasures of them are cor∣ruptible, your Lands, Gold and Silver are fading treasures; the day of the Lords Judgments are at hand upon you, and the Rod of his Wrath will smite you, and ye shall have Poverty and Want
instead of Fulness and Excess, and ye shall have Leanness and Barrenness, and God will plead with you in the way of have sinned against him; The time of your Visitation draws near. Wo unto you Merchants, Traders, Buyers and Sellers, that have been double-dealers and double-tongu'd, and dealt deceit∣fully in your Commodities with your Neighbours; VVo unto ye that have got Gain by double-dealing, and by feigned and flatter∣ing speeches have beguiled one another, and sought to out-reach in your barganing every man his Brother! These things have ye done, O ye Covetous men, ye have even robbed the Poor by your craft and guileful dealing, by your smooth and flattering tongues; and if any amongst you could not use fraud, and dissemble, such have been your prey and scorn; and it's your use to discommend a Commodity when you buy it, and to praise it when you sell it; and ye make a fair outside to please the eye, and ye use multitude of words and fair speeches, and deceive the Simple, and get Gain by Oppression, Craft and Deceit: Wo unto you, Repent of this your sin; Cleanse your hearts, ye Sinners; and purifie your hearts, ye Double-minded: I charge you by the Lord, give over your double-dealing, and deceitfull merchandize; cease to lye and defraud, cease your flattery and feigned words, and speak the truth every one to his Neighbour, and come out of your Ini∣quities; use not a bad conscience any longer, for it's a fearfull Abomination against the Lord; but minde the Light of Christ in you, which will convince you in your Consciences of your naugh∣ty and sinful wayes, and that Light will exercise your Conscien∣ces to do the Truth, and speak the Truth to your Neighbour in all things, and this is blessed, and the Gain that is thereby got∣ten, is not a Curse; for ye ought in all your wayes to reverence the Lord and respect him, that he should lead you and guide you in your exercise of all earthly things: For the Earth is the Lords; and the Fulness thereof, and it ought to be exercised to his Glory; and there is sufficient in this Creation for all People, And there∣fore covet not earthly things one from another, neither oppress nor over-reach one another about them; neither treasure up earthly things, while the Poor want, for if ye do, ye hide your selves from your own slesh, laying field to field till there is no place for the Poor; and wo unto such, the Day of the Lord will
be upon you: but learn the Wisdom of God, how to be ordered, and how to order all things of this Creation, and be in unity and good agreement amongst your selves, and do not fall out nor strive, not contend nor envy one another about earthly things, but if ye have much, or if ye have little, be contented with what you have, and do not grind the hearts and consciences one of another to get earthly things, for they will fade and perish away; and seek not after that which perisheth, but after that which is unto eternal life; for the Day of the Lord is at hand, and his Judgments upon all Oppressors, Double-dealers and false hear∣ted Flatterers, that are covetous of earthly things. Wo unto all ye Drunkards and Swearers, Whoremongers and Prophane Persons, the Judgments of the Lord are upon you un∣awares; ye that destroy the Creation upon your Lusts, that are run into the Excess of Wine and Beer, and that cover it exces∣sively, and that drink till ye inflame your selves, and spend your time in it; ye are like the Beasts of the field, and like the Swine that wallows in filthiness; ye pervert the right use and end of the good Creatures of God, and spend them upon your lusts, and have not regard unto the living God; and one sin even begets another, Drunkenness begets Swearing, and Prophane words, and VVhoredom, and beastly Affections, and thus you adde sin to sin, and heap up one sin upon another, contrary to the Light in your own Consciences; and thus ye serve the Devil and Sa∣tan, committing Iniquity, with both hands, as it were, by Drun∣kenness and Swearing, and taking the Name of the Lord in vain, and Cursed Speaches, and falling out one with another; and your minds are erred from the Lord, and ye abuse your selves, and your own bodies, which were made for the Service of God, and not for Whoredom; and ye slay your own Souls by your own Iniquities, and many times provoke the Lord to destroy both soul and body: VVo unto you, the Plagues of God are your portion, and Misery your end here and hereafter; Repent of your Iniquities, and turn from them, lest the Lord find you in your Iniquities when he comes to Judgement; for if you conti∣nue in them you can never be pardoned, but you sin unto death, and the Lord will come upon you suddenly; for ye that follow Drunkenness and Prophaness you live contrary to the Light in
your own Consciences, and you sin against your knowledge, against that knowledge that God hath given you; and this is your greatest sin, even because ye do the things which ye know ye should not do, and the Light in your Consciences doth shew you, that these things are evil before you do them; but ye doing the things contrary to the Light in your own Consciences, this makes your crime heinous, and your sin unpardonable, if ye con∣tinue in Sin and Prophaness, contrary to the reproof of Gods Spirit in your own Consciences: VVherefore ye prophane per∣sons, cease to do evil, lest the Lords Judgments come upon you suddenly to your destruction, and the Lord smite you, and you never be healed. VVo unto all ye hypocritical and deceitful Professors of Reli∣gion, that hold the Truth in Unrighteousness, that have a talk and a shew of Religion, and that have the name of Church-members and of Worshippers of God, but are dead in sins and trespasses; ye that are Christians by name, but want the nature, who are wolves in sheeps cloathing, that have Christs words, the the Prophets and Apostles words, but want their Spirit and Life; VVo unto you, the Day of the Lord is at hand upon you, ye Hy∣pocrites, ye that serve God with your lips, and with your mouths profess much love, when as your hearts are full of Envie, Co∣vetousness and Earthly-mindedness; ye are the Apostate Chri∣stians, that have taken the Form of Godlinesse upon you, but want the Power; ye preach, and pray, and hear Sermons, and keep Sabbath-dayes, and perform Duties, but ye are not changed in your hearts, but the old nature is alive, and the old birth lives in you; and ye are unlike unto God in nature, and ye walk in the Flesh and not in the Spirit, and ye take Christs words and the Apostles words, and use your tongues, when God never spoke to you; O ye Hypocrites! ye have a name to live, but are dead, and ye think ye are Rich, when as ye are poor, miserable, blind and naked, and your souls are lean and want the Bread of Life, and ye have not put off the body of Sin, nor have you overcome your Souls enemies, but the burden of Sin lyes upon your Consciences, and Temptations overcome you daily; and though you say, ye have Faith in Christ, yet your hearts are not purified, but the Old Man, with his deeds, is yet alive, and the New Creature is not
brought forth in you, nor is Christ living in you, and speaking in you; the day of the Lord will come upon you, you false-hearted men, ye Apostate Christians, that hold the Profession of Truth, and Church, and Gospel, and Ministry in your unrighteous minds; your Sacrifices are not acceptable to God, nor your Offerings well-pleasing to him; for your hearts are not aright before him, and your Hypocrisie will God judge, and his Wrath will go out like fire to consume your glory, and God will cloath himself with Zeal, as with a Cloak, and with a Garment of Vengeance, and he will slay you with his Sword, and wound your Conscien∣ces with the Words of his Mouth, and your Religion will not save you, nor your Garment cover you from the Wrath of the Al∣mighty: Wo unto you, the Mighty Day of the Lord is at hand upon you, ye Earthly Professors, who would be heirs of two Kingdoms, who would enjoy God and this World too, and love its Vanities and Profits and Pleasures, and Honours, and live in strife and contention one with another about earthly things, and about your Religion too, and are not of one heart, and mind, and soul, but are strangers to the New Covenant of God, though you hear Sermons, and say a Form of Prayer, and keep Sabbaths and Lecture-dayes, and perform Ordinances and Duties, and yet your hearts are hard, and the body of Sin and Death lyes upon your Consciences, and you are not changed into the Divine Nature; this Religion will not save you, away with it all, it's of Antichrish, and his spirit leads you, while you walk in the Form of Godliness without the Power, the Lord will come upon you suddenly; therefore Repent ye of your Hypocrisies, and turn to the Spirit of God within you, hear its Reproofs, and obey it, and walk in the Spirit, and be ye Changed, or else you can ne∣ver be Saved. VVo, Wo unto all ye false Teachers and blind Leaders of the People, ye Diviners and false Prophets, and Day of the Lord is at hand upon-you; ye have deceived souls for dishonest gain, ye have run and were never sent of God, and ye have not pro∣fited the people at all, and ye have taken the name upon you of Ministers of Christ, when he never sent you forth; and you have kept a prating and preaching up and down, and run for Gifts, and Rewards, and Hire; ye have deceived the World, and the
Bloud of Souls rests upon you: O ye Generation of Serpents! poy∣son hath lodged under your tongues, your hearts have been rot∣ten, and your tongues feigned and full of flattery, and you have been as Canker-worms in the Earth, and have corrupted the whole World; Whom have not ye deceived by your Lyes and false Divinations? Whom have not you cryed Peace unto, if they would but give you Gifts, Money and Hire? What Form of Religion would not you take up for advantage to your selves? how often have you turned from one way to another? Oh ye false-hearted men, the God of Heaven will shew you no mercy; ye are the men that have made the Earth drunk with false faith, and false doctrines, and with contention and distention, some∣time preaching up one Government, sometimes another; and sometime being for one way of Worship, and sometimes for an∣other; Treachery hath lodged in your hearts above all others; ye have eaten up the sin of the People, and cryed Peace unto the Ungodly: Wo unto ye that have gone in Cain's way, that have bread Contention, Persecution, Strife and Emulation amongst People, and that have gone in Balaams way for Gifts and Re∣wards, and would do any great man a pleasure, and even curse the people for Money; ye have been such as all the holy Prophets cryed against, your fruits and works declares it; ye have sought for your Gain from your Quarter, and could never have enough, such as Isaiah cryed against, Chap. 56. and such as Micha cryed against, Micah 3. That preached for Hire, and divined for Money, and leaned upon the Lord, and cryed Peace to them that would give Money, and prepared War against them that would not: and these things have you done, some of ye Teachers and Priests, and ye have been blind Watchmen, and ye have been idle and lazy Shepherds, such as Ezekiel cryed against, Chap. 34. that ruled over people with Force and Cruelty, and killed them that were fed, and did not heal the diseased, nor strengthen the weak, but pusht with the horn at such as went astray from you; and idle and lazy Shepherds have you been, who have not sed the Flock with living food, but you have caused them to drink of the foul waters, and their souls are lean and barren under your Preach∣ing; Oh look into your Flocks, and see what fruit is brought forth by them, and what may be gathered from them; Oh the
abundance of Pride and Wickedness, of Ambition and Vain∣glory, and Covetousness, and the love of this World, lying and double-dealing, and all the fruits of the flesh, How do they abound amongst the flocks of your fold? who are in their fruits, and by their works not the Sheep of Christs Pasture, but are like Goats and VVolves under your Teaching; Can ye behold this and consider of it, and not be ashamed of the fruit of your wayes? VVhat have ye brought forth these many years? or what profit have the People received from you, who are yet in their sins, un∣turned from them, and not converted to God? whereby it ap∣pears you have run, and never were sent, because the People are not profited at all; and it grieves the heart of the Righteous to look into your Vineyards, and to see such bad fruit growing; you have been sloathfull Tillers, and have not sown the good Seed in the hearts of the People, but the Seed of Corruption brings forth fruit in them, and your Vineyards are like barren and untilled ground, that is unplowed and undigged, and unplanted with Trees of Righteousness: Oh ye have been unprofitable Vineyard-dressers, and ye have laboured for your selves, and not for the Lord, as is manifest; and ye have been idle and lazy, and the God of Heaven is weary of you, and the time is at hand he will pluck you up by the roots, and visit you with great destru∣ction, and your name shall be a Reproach amongst men; for ye have not sought the Lords honour, but your own; and ye have been changable in your wayes for your own advantages; ye have preached for filthy Lucre, and through Covetousness made mer∣chandize of People; and ye have traded with the Scriptures, and made a Trade of Preaching the Gospel; and ye have made Traf∣fick of the Souls of men: and these things have you done, and the Lord hath kept silence, and he hath forborn to smite you, and therefore have you been hardened the more in your Trans∣gressions, as though the Lord took no notice; and you have filled your hands with dishonest gain in your unrighteous wayes, and your sins are increased every day against the God of Heaven; you repent not when you are warned, but reject reproof, and go on without fear; ye are a company of proud men, heady and high-minded men, ambitious and self-seeking persons, even such as the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles marked forth for
Deceivers, and your fruits and works do prove it; ye have been covered with the Sheeps cloathing in your unrighteous natures, and your Iniquities are almost full, and the Lord will bring unre∣sistable destruction upon you; in a day when you cry, Peace, peace, then sudden destruction will come: Wo unto you, because of your Iniquities, the Earth is weary of you, which ye have corrupted through your false wayes, and the Kingdoms groan under your Oppressions, and the Earth will spue you out, and the People, whom you have deceived, shall rise up in Judgment against you; the dreadful Day of the Lord is at hand upon you, ye Apo∣states from the Life and Faith of Christ Jesus, for of that race you are, even of them Apostates that went out in the Apostles dayes, that went in Balaam's way, and Cain's way, for ye are of the spirit that kills and persecutes people about Worship and Sacrifices, and Religion, as Cain did; and ye go for Gifts and Rewards, even as Balaam did: These things are so, the Witness of God in your Consciences shall answer, and all People shall acknowledge the truth hereof in the day when God pleads with all the wicked. All People, Return and Repent of your Iniquities, the dreadful Day of the Lord is at hand, ye Sinners and Transgressors, ye hy∣pocritical Professors and prophane Persons, the Day of Venge∣ance is at hand: Whither will you fly, and where will you leave your glory? where will you seek a defence, or where can you be hid? the Mountains will not cover you, nor the Rocks will not fall upon you, the wrath of the Lamb you cannot escape, even the long-suffering of God will be turned into a flame of anger, and patience will be turned into sharp rebuke, the wrath of the Lamb will utterly smite you, and the Cup of Gods Indignation you must drink, all the Earth must tast of it, and the Wicked shall drink the dreggs; Wherefore all ye Inhabitants of the Earth forsake your Transgressions, that the Lord may not cut you off for ever, but let God arise to destroy your Iniquities, and to save your Souls, let him take vengeance upon your Inventions, that he may forgive you: Oh! why will you dye, why will you perish? the Lord would have you to return, that he might save you. And this is the day of your Visitation, the door of Mercy is yet
open for a little season, and the Lord yet calls unto you for a moment; but the time is at hand, that he who is filthy, shall be filthy still, and that determination shall be passed, Come, ye Bles∣sed, and, Go ye Cursed; the doleful sentence shall be pronounced to all workers of Iniquity, Into everlasting Burning must they de∣part, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, and shall not see the Countenance of the Lord to refresh their souls, but in the presence of the Lord, and of the Lamb, shall the Wicked be tormented: Where∣fore hear and tremble, all ye Transgressors that live and act con∣trary to your knowledge, and against the Witness of God in your own Consciences; and this is your great sin, for which the wrath of God cometh, not because you have acted in Ignorance and without knowledge, but because you have acted against the Light in your Consciences, and sinned against your knowledge, and done the things, which you knew were evil before you did them; and because hereof you are not to be excused, but the burden of your own sins and the guilt of them will fall heavy upon you in the Day of the Lord; For this is the Condemnation of the World, that Light is come into it, but you have loved Darknesse rather than Light, and followed evil deeds and loved them, and this contrary to the Light that is come into the world, and which hath enlightned your own Consciences. Certain Propositions of Faith laid down, which every one must believe, or else they cannot be saved. I. NOw none can be saved from the Wrath of the Lord but they who are saved from their Sins; for Sin brings the Wrath of God upon the Consciences of men, and Anguish upon Soul and Body; and who are not saved from Sin, cannot be saved from Wrath; for Wrath pursues the Guilty, and he that doth evil, sin lies at his door, and continual anguish upon his spirit because of sin, and the load and burden of the body of death op∣presseth his soul, and anger from God kindleth in his breast, because he hath sinned; and he knows he is
guy of Transgression, and the Lord wounds him in his Conscience, and no man in that state can speak peace un∣to him, nor can any save him from the Wrath of God, because he is not saved from his Sin, nor from the guilt of it; but his grief and burden is, because he hath sinned against the Light in his own Conscience: And therefore whosoever will be saved from Wrath, must be saved from Sin and Christ, must purifie his heart, and the Blood of the Lamb must sanctifie him, and his Conscience must be cleansed from the guilt of Transgression, and Christ must live in him, and he must live the life of Faith, which gives victory over all Sin, or else he cannot be saved with the Salvation of God eternally.

Again, Whosoever will be saved with the Salva∣tion of God, must own the Light of Christ Jesus in his own Conscience, and he must believe in this Light and walk in it, even the Light in his Conscience, that con∣vinces him, and checks him for his evil deeds, and that lets him see what sin he is guilty of; you must believe in this Light, and follow it, and depart from that, and for∣sake that Iniquity which it convinces you of, and do that Good which it moves your hearts unto, or else you can never be saved; for if your continue in evil-doing, con∣trary to the Light of Christ in your own Consciences, you are in a condemned condition, and you cannot be justified of the Lord, while you are accused by the Light within you, of such and such sins, and that you are guilty of them, and forsakes them not; for the God of Heaven condemneth and justifieth men according to the Witness of the Light in their own Consciences; for it is Gods Evidence, to bear witness for God, and to accuse or ex∣cuse every man in his sight, and according to its evidence, God justifieth or condemneth all the children of men.
III. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must be born again of the Seed of God, and must be changed and renewed in mind and heart, and spirit; and old things must pass away, and all things must be made new; and a new nature must live in you, and the Image of God must be brought forth, which is in Righteousness and true Holiness, which is like unto God; and this is the new Creation, which every one must witness to be wrought in them that ever enters into Gods Kingdom; For saith Christ, Except a man be born again he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God; for it is not a profession of Religion made with the lips, nor the pra∣ctises of Duties and Ordinances, taken on the performed in the old nature, and a holding of truth in unrighteousness; this is not the way of Salvation, but it is the regenerating and making like unto God, being his Image of Justice, Truth and Righteous∣ness; it is this in which men may be saved everlastingly. IV. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must receive the Spi∣rit of God, and it must dwell in them, even the Spirit of the Fa∣ther; and they must be taught by it, and led into all Truth, to do the Truth, and speak the Truth in all things; even the Spirit of Truth must be received, to teach and to lead in all the wayes of God; it alone must teach; and all the Hireling-Teachers of the world must be turned away from, by whom peoples souls have been deceived; all such as have run, and God never sent them; that have cryed up Teaching and Ministry, and through whom people have not received the Spirit of the Father; all such Teachers must he denyed, their Church and Ministry; and the Spirit of the Father must only teach and lead; and you must walk in the Spirit, and not after the Flesh; for if you walk after the Flesh, in the wayes and works of it, you are in the state of Condemnation, and not of Salvation; and the Spirit of God doth not teach you, but you are out of the New Covenant of God; in which Covenant all are taught of the Lord, and in Righteous∣ness are they established: the Spirit of God is put within them, and the Law of God is written in their hearts; and they need no man to teach them, but as the Spirit teacheth: and this is the New Covenant of Peace with God, into which all must come to witness this, or else they cannot be saved. V. Again, All that will be saved, must be sanctified, cleansed and purified from all unrighteousness, by the Spirit and Word
of God, whereby every heart must be made clean, and every conscience sprinkled with the Blood of the Lamb; and the body of Sin and Death must be put off, and the bondage of Corruption must be broken, and Iniquity must be forsaken, and turned from, and Sin must be judged in the flesh, and Purity, Holiness and Righteousness must live and reign in all that will be saved; and Sin and Transgression, and the guilt of it must be removed; and you must shew forth the Image of God in Holiness and Righte∣ousness; and must be pure, as he is pure, in kind and quality; and you must walk in Holiness and Righteousness, being freed from Corruption, and from the wayes of Sin and Death, being sanctified in Body, Mind and Spirit, by the Word of the Lord; and Sin must be blotted out, and Transgression must be covered, and Iniquity must be remembred no more, and in all things you must cease to do evil, and learn to do well, if ever you will be saved. VI. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must witness Christ re∣vealed in you, and He must live in you, and you must be fol∣lowers of him whithersoever he goes, and your Bodies must be the Temples of the living God, and God must walk in you and dwell in you, according to his promise; and he must be your King, your Judge and Law-giver, and Teacher, Father and Master, and he must be all in all unto you, even God the Fa∣ther who is blessed for ever; you must know him near you, and feel his presence in you, to be your joy, life and peace; and you must have fellowship with him in Spirit, and must worship him in Spirit, and by the Spirit, without respect of Dayes, Times or Places: Every one that will be saved must come into this, and witness it, for this is the way of the Salvation of God. VII. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must live in the power of Godliness, and must deny all Forms of Religion with∣out the Power; all Profession of Scriptures, Ordinances, Church-member-ship, Praying and Preaching, which is not in the Power of God, and by his Spirit, must be denyed, and that part that holds it, (that holds the Form of Godliness without the Power) must be crucified; and every one must come into the Power of the Spirit of God, and must witness that to work in them, to will and to do; and no more professing of the things of God, but as they are witnessed by the work of his Spirit in their hearts: you
must not hold Truth any longer in unrighteousness, nor make a profession of it in your unrighteous minds; no more talking of Justification and Redemption, nor of any of the matters of Gods Kingdom, but according as they are witnessed by the working of the Spirit of God in the heart; and every one must feel in him∣self the evidence and testimony of the Spirit of God to witness the Truth in his heart (or conscience) of what he professeth with his mouth. VIII. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must witness the Scriptures of Truth fulfilled in themselves: the things that they have read of without them, must be wrought within them, wrought in their hearts by the same Spirit as gave forth the Scriptures; they must passe through the same conditions as the holy men of God did; and the same truth that the Scriptures declare of, must be revealed in the heart, by the same Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures; and none must profess more than they do enjoy from God; and all flesh must be silent from speaking of the things of Gods Kingdom, which they have not seen, handled, tasted and felt, by the working of the Spirit of God in their Consciences: and this is to witness the Scriptures fulfilled, when you have experience of the same conditions, and of the same operations and manifestations which the Servants of the Lord passed through and had experience of; and so that you may speak what you have heard, and seen, and handled, and tasted of the Word of Life: All that will be saved must come to this, and witness it. IX. Again, Whosoever will be saved, must believe in Je∣sus Christ, and receive him; and they must take up his daily cross and follow him; and must know him to mortifie and cru∣cifie them to the world: and he must work the same things in you by his Spirit spiritually, as he wrought without you in his Person, or else you have no part in him, nor salvation by him: For it is not enough unto eternal life, only to believe that there was such a one as a Christ, and that he did and spoke such and such things at a distance without you; for many may make a be∣lief and a profession of this, and yet perish; but Him that was, of whom you read, without you, must you receive, and witness within you; and you must know Him as he was before Abraham was, and before the world was; and He himself by his Spi∣rit in you must give you the knowledge of Himself, what He
was before the beginning, what he is now, and what he shall for ever be. X. Again, Every one that will be saved, must come up out of the Apostacy into which all Christendom hath been fallen, and must come into the same Spirit, Life and Power as the Apostles were in, from which Life, spirit and Power, all Christendom have been Apostates, and they have held the words and practices of the Apostles without the same Life and Power, and made Sects, Churches and Ministers, but out of the same Life and Spirit as the holy men of God were in; and all that will be sa∣ved, must be restored and recovered into the same Spirit and Life in their Churches, Ministry and Ordinances, as the Apostles of Christ Jesus were in: and this is Restoration, when People come again into the same Life and Spirit of God, which the Apostate Christians have all wanted, and been in the Form of Ministry, Churches, Religion and Godliness, without the Power; And unto this is the Lord God restoring People, his Day is dawned, and his everlasting Light is risen, and his Name will be known in the Earth: And none can be saved with the salvation of God, but who believe, receive and understand these things. A general Objection answered. Object. 1. And whereas there is a great cry by some people of late, That there must be no more Private Meetings, but all People must come to Church (as they say) and that there must be no more Conventicles, &c. Answ. As for Conventicles, I understand you mean Meetings out of Publick Steeple-houses, and that there must be no private Meetings for Preaching and Prayer, but all People must be for∣ced to come to Publick Places of Worship. Now I say, if the Authority that is now set up, and hath the Power, doth exercise it self in this way; then the God of Heaven will be provoked against it, to overthrow it and confound it, if it proceed contrary to the End of just Rule and Authority ordained of God, which is for the punishment of them that do evil in things between man and man; but not to impose upon mens Consciences, in things relating to the Worship and Service of God: But the Lord God is wholly Judge in such matters, and not any man; and if
any men should erre in their minds concerning Faith and Do∣ctrine, and the Worship of God, that belongs to the Lord to pu∣nish, and not to any Earthly Authority. And what! must not the People of God come together to worship the Lord in Spirit and Truth? Must not People con∣veen together in this Age, as the People of God did in Ages past? Did not Christ many times preach in the Desert, and some∣times in a ship by the Sea-side, and sometimes on a Mountain, as you may read in the Scriptures? And did not he often preach unto the Pharisees, and sometimes to his Disciples, out of the publick Synagogues? And might not the Iews have called those Meetings, Conventicles, because they were not in their Publick Synagogues? And also, did not the Apostles and Saints, after the Resurrection of Christ, when they returned from Ierusalem, meet together privately? for they went into an Upper Room, and waited upon the Lord, and continued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication: And again, at another time, they were about an hundred and twenty in number, that were in one place to wait upon the Lord, and Peter preached unto them; and were these Meetings Conventicles, because they were not in a publick Synagogue, but in an Upper Chamber, and in a private place? And thus the Saints of old met together, as ye may read, Act. 1. and worshipped God in Spirit and in Truth, and prea∣ched and prayed; and must not the People of God now meet to∣gether to pray and wait upon the Lord, but they must be re∣proached with the name of Conventiclers, and threatned and pu∣nished for so doing? Oh how blind is this Generation, and how contrary to the true Christian Spirit in their practices! And did not Philip preach Jesus unto the Eunuch in a Chariot, as they went on the way? and this was not in a publick Synagogue, as in Act. 8. And did not Peter preach to Cornelius, with many others, in Cornelius his house? and this was a Meeting, and not in a Synagogue, Acts. 10. And did not the Apostles and Saints meet together in an Upper Chamber, where Paul preached until midnight amongst the Saints? Act. 20. and was this a Conventicle, and an unlawfull Meeting? Might not the Iews have said, this was an Unlawful Assembly, being in a Chamber, and not in a Publick Synagogue? And again, Did not Paul preach in his own Hired House for two whole years to∣gether,
and received all that came in unto him? Act. 28. And here were Private Meetings out of Publick Synagogues. But did the Iews threaten them, and inflict sufferings upon them, because they met in private houses, and would not come to their Syna∣gogues and Publick Worship? or did they reproach them with the name of Sectaries and Conventiclers, when they met together to wait upon the Lord, sometime in praying, and sometime in preaching? And thus you may see by many Examples, that the Saints and true Christian Churches in the dayes of old met to∣gether, sometime on Mountains, and sometime in Deserts, and sometime in Upper Chambers, and sometime in their own hired houses, and not in the publick Synagogues; but they were ga∣thered from the Temple and first Priesthood, and from the Wor∣ship which God had once commanded, which stood in outward things and Ordinances; and when they had received the sub∣stance, they denyed the shadows, types and figures, and did not uphold them any longer: And they were gathered by the preaching of the Gospel into the second and new Covenant, and they met together in private Houses, and upper Chambers, and by the Sea-side to preach and pray, and to worship the Lord▪ and we do not read that the Iews persecuted them for so doing: And will you that have the name of Christians persecute the People of God, though they meet together in private houses, and their own hired houses, and cannot come to your Temples and Steeple-houses? And will not you suffer such to meet together out of your Publick Places, but you will persecute them, and call them Hereticks, and such like? Is not this worse than ever the Iews did to the Apostles? And so you are out of the Example of the true Christians, who met together, and preached and prayed often, and not in a Synagogue or Publick Place; but you cry against them that do so, and threaten to persecute for it: and thus you shew your selves out of the true Christan Example, and in this you are worse than the Iews and more cruel, if you should perse∣cute People for meeting together to wait upon the Lord in their own houses, or in what place or time, as the Lord should move their hearts; but if you proceed in this way, and will not per∣mit the People of God to meet together in their own houses, and not in your Idol-Temples; then the Power of the Lord will confound you, and God will break you to pieces, and you will
feel his heavy Wrath upon your Consciences, and God will smite you with his Judgments inwardly and outwardly. Now for your restraining of people from one way of Worship, and forcing them to another, and compelling them about Religion by cruel Laws and Commandments of men; this is of Antichrist, for you to do, and of the Devil: for all forcing of People to this kind of Worship, and from another, and imposing upon their Consciences in matters of Gods Kingdom; this is also of Anti∣christ, and contrary to Christ and his VVay; for he won People by sound Doctrine, and by Love, and by a good Conversation; and so did his Disciples, for they never forced any by outward violence to their Worship, nor to their Church-government and Ordinances: but it was the practice of the Beast, and the Dra∣gon, that first forced People, and compelled them to worship, since the dayes of the Apostles, Rev. 13. It was Antichrist that first imposed upon People in the Ignorance of their Consciences, and contrary to their Consciences, by the Commandments of men, false Faith, false Worship, false Ministry, false Doctrine, and false Religions; so that now, if you should force any contrary to their Consciences, to your Steeple-houses, to hear and say your Form of Prayers, we shall say then you are Antichrist, and of the Devil, if so be you should endeavour to compel any, either against their Consciences, or in the Ignorance of their Consciences, to your way of Worship or Religion. Therefore take heed how you meddle in these things, lest God confound you: and as for us, we are the People of God, we fear his Name, and worship him, and cannot bow to the De∣vil; and we need not be forced to worship the Lord, for his Spi∣rit leads us into all Truth, and we need none of your outward Pre∣scriptions, or Form of Prayers, for the Spirit of God teach∣eth us in all these things, when, and where, and how we should worship the Lord God, who is a Spirit, and will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth, which is free, and not by outward force; and all the Worship that is otherwise, and not in the free Spirit of Christ, is of Great Babylon, whom the Lord will confound and destroy.
Another general Objection answered. Object. 2. Again, Whereas it is said by some, Now there must be no more private Preachers, Unlearned men, and men not Ordained must not now preach any more; Lay-persons must not be Preachers that are not so qualified, nor so and so ordained: and this is the pre∣sent talk among some people. Answ. To this I also answer, and say, VVo to them that would stop, or quench, or limit the Spirit of God in Sons or Daughters; for such are denyers of the Scriptures and the Power of God; and such bring guilt upon their own Consciences, and work fearful Abomination against God. And what, must not the Spirit of the Lord speak now, where it is, in this Age, as it did in the dayes of old, as you may read in the Scriptures? for, was not Elisha a Plow-man, and was not he called from the Plough, 1 King. 19. and became a Prophet of the Lord unto the House of Israel, and had the Spirit of Elijah poured upon him? and would not you have said he was a Lay-man, a Plow-man, un∣ordained, not fitting to preach, if you had lived in his dayes? And was not Amos called from following the Flock? who had been no Prophet, nor no Prophets son, but an Herds-man, Amos 7, 14, 15. and it was lawful for him to preach the Word of the Lord, though he was but an Herds-man, and had been no Prophet, nor Prophets son; which if he had lived in your dayes, you would have called him a Lay-man, an unfit person, unlearned, and one not ordained for the Ministry: and you, like Amaziah the wicked Priest of Bethel, would now quench the Spirit, as he would have done in Amos, who was a Trades-man, and such an one as you now call Lay-men, who are not (as you say) fitting to preach. And did not Christ Jesus himself chuse Fisher-men, and sent them forth to preach the Gospel? and such as were men of Trades, and unlearned in Books, as it is written, Act. 4. 13. When the Rulers saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived they were Unlearned, they marvelled; and these were Ministers of Christ, and preached the Everlasting Gospel, whom you would have called Lay-men, and men unfit to preach, had you lived in their dayes. And Paul himself by occupation was a Tent-maker, it is said, and he laboured with his hands, and yet
was a Preacher of the Gospel; and there are multitudes of Wit∣nesses in the Scriptures of these things, how that men of Trades, and unlearned in Letters and Books, and never were brought up at Schools and Colledges, but followed the Plough, and were keepers of Cattel, and some followed fishing; such as these in old time had the Spirit of God given them, and they preached the Gospel: And what if the Lord at this day give his Spirit to such as these, and send them forth to preach the Gospel, even to such as were brought up and educated (it may be) at Handy∣craft Trades, and are labouring-men, and are not learned at Schools and Colledges; will you limit the Lord, and quench his Spirit, and reproach his Wayes and Servants, and now call them Lay-persons, and say they are not fitting to preach? for they are not Learned nor Ordained, say you; and calling them Mechan∣nicks and private Preachers, and say, they must not now be ad∣mitted to preach the Gospel; and in this you deny the Scriptures, and the Example of the Saints in former Ages, and so neither know the Scriptures, nor the Spirit that gave them forth: though you say, you own the Scriptures, yet if the same things come to passe which they declare of, you deny them in this Age, and cry against such as Hereticks who witness the fulfilling of them; which shews you are of Antichrist, and that you quench the Spi∣rit in Sons and Daughters, which God hath promised in the New Covenant, that he would give and pour forth upon Sons and Daughters, and they shall prophesie: And are not we to look for these things now? VVhat, must not God's Promises be ful∣filled? must not an Herds-man now preach if the Word ofs the Lord come unto him? and must not Plow-men now speak of the things of God, if they have experience of them? and must not Fisher-men and Tent-makers bear witness to the Name of Christ, if they have received of his Spirit? And will you deny the Scriptures, which saith, As every one hath received the Spirit and the Gift, so let him administer the same one to another? 1 Pet. 4. or, do you say, None must have the Gift of the Spirit, but such as are brought up at Schools and Colledges? or, will you limit the Holy One to such and such men and wayes? Oh you are blind and ignorant, who would quench the Spirit of God, that it should not speak in these dayes, and thus you are denyers of the Scriptures: but God hath given of his Spirit, and spoken in
our hearts, and we must prophesie, and speak as the Spirit of God giveth utterance, as the Saints of old did, Act. 2. 4. Now for your way of making Ministers at Schools and Col∣ledges, and so quallifying them with Knowledge in the seven Sciences, as it is said, and ordaining them in that manner and way, as among Papists and Protestants hath been practised for Ages, this way of making Ministers, and sending of them forth; was never known among the Apostles; for they were not thus made and ordained, and sent to preach, nor was this way of making and sending forth Ministers, till the Spirit and Power of God was lost and forsaken by the Apostate Christians; and the Scriptures make no mention of such wayes, nor give no Ex∣ample for such things; and we cannot own any Religion, nor any practice thereof, but what we have Example for from the Saints of old before us: and we believe that it is generally of Antichrist, to invent and introduce such and such Practices for Religion towards God, and for the worship of him, for which there is no Example in all the Christian Churches in the Apo∣stles dayes; and we believe that way of making Ministers, and sending of them forth, which is not approvable by the Scrip∣tures, nor according to them, is of Antichrist, and not of God; neither can we own such Ministers nor their Ministry, who are not ordained of God, and according to the Scriptures: nor can we deny private Preachers nor their Ministry, as you call them, if they have received the Spirit of Christ, though they be not so learned outwardly, nor ordained according to what some may call the right way; but who are Ministers, made and sent of God, and have the Authority of his Spirit, such we own, and cannot deny; and such the Lord will bless with his Presence, to the confounding of all their Enemies. Concerning Settlement in a happy Government. Object. There hath been great Divisions and Distractions in these Nations for divers years; and in the midst of them the great cry hath been by many for Settlement and Peace, and for a quiet and happy Go∣vernment. Answ. These things hath the Lord suffered to come to pass in the world; even great Contentions, Divisions and Distractions, and much Changes of Government in these Kingdoms; And the
appearing cause of these things, hath been from the lust that hath warred in the Members, for from thence doth Wars and Strife arise; and many have been Ambitions, Vain-glorious, Self-seek∣ing and Covetous of the Honours and Pleasures of this VVorld; the lust and desire of these things hath possessed the minds of men, and induced them to envy and wrath one against another, and hath filled them with heart-burnings, and cruelty of mind, to the killing and destroying of one another, by Wars and Bloodsheds, and by Plots and Contrivances have sought how to extinguish one another from the Earth, that themselves might be exalted: and thus from the desires that have warred in mens minds, have Wars arisen against the persons of men, and among them: and this is the appearing cause of the Wars and Distractions that have been in these Nations; though the hidden cause (which hath not so appeared) hath been in God, and because of the wickedness of men, both high and low, and because of their Oppressions and Abominations, which have been many and great in the World; Therefore hath the God of Heaven been provoked in just Judge∣ment towards Rulers and People, to suffer men to destroy one another, and to execute Bloudsheds and Destructions one upon another; and he hath brought it to pass, in giving up men to the fulfilling of their cruel intents, which hath been hatched in their evil minds, every man against his Neighbour, and even because they have been departed out of his Counsel, and followed their own wicked wayes; and Justice, and Mercy, and Truth have been wanting amongst men in these Nations; so that this is the prin∣cipal cause wherefore the Lord God hath brought about and suf∣fered these Wars, Distractions, Confusions and Discords in these latter dayes; and out of the justness of Gods Judgments, because of the wickedness of men, have these things been. And now these Distractions and Confusions, and Discords amongst men can never wholly and truly cease to be, till Ini∣quity and Transgression be repented of, and turned from, which is the very cause wherefore God hath done and suffered these things, as I have said; and so men must cease from Oppression, from Cruelty, and from all Unrighteousness, and must turn to the Lord, and become cleansed from their sins, ere ever the Judge∣ments of the Lord be removed, and these Distractions, Wars and Confusions cease to be in these Lands; and till men become
meek and humble, and till they cease to seek Revenge one of an∣other; and till they cease all Oppression and Covetousness, In∣justice and Unmercifulness; and till they forsake their worldly Honour and high Titles, which puffs them up in Arrogancy and Ambition; and even till every man forsake his particular Ini∣quity; till all these things be, Distractions will not cease, nor shall Settlement, and Peace, and happy Government ever be: This is certainly so; for except the Cause be removed, the Effect can never cease: and there appears to be at this day as great (if not far more) Dissatisfactions in the minds of some People, than hath been heretofore; and it appears to be as far from Settle∣ment and true Peace in an happy Union in Government, as for many years; though it hath been expected by many, that we should have Peace and Settlement in Government, yet, behold, it cannot be; for there are Discontents and Murmurings in the minds of men, and Unsettlement in their spirits, and the Foun∣dation of a happy Government is not yet discovered unto many; nor do the people walk in the way of Peace, but Iniquity is a∣bounding, Oppression and Cruelty yet lives; Hard-heartedness and Envy, Pride and Ambition, are not yet cut down, neither in all the Governours, nor in the Governed: and this is not the way of Peace and true Settlement; but it is the way of Troubles and Distractions, and the very Foundation of greater Distracti∣ons and Wars, rather than of Settlement and happy Government: These things are so; and therefore true Peace and Settlement in good Agreement, who can expect? because the ground of Di∣stractions and Unsettlement is continued and increased, rather than abated and removed amongst many; and the true Founda∣tion of Peace and Settlement in happy Government, is not yet raised up amongst men; but because Injustice and Oppression are continued, therefore will God be provoked to bring Distracti∣ons, Wars and Tribulations upon the Kingdoms of all the World; and God will confound and dash in pieces, Powers, Authorities, Rulers, Nations and Peoples; and He will break one Potsherd against another, and overthrow one Mountain against another; and the hands of cruel men will God suffer to devour one ano∣ther; and ambitious and malicious hearts shall be suffered to finish one anothers end, because of their own wickedness: and therefore be not deceived; Blessedness in the Kingdoms of this
World can never be, except Iniquity and Transgression be de∣parted from; except Oppression and Hard-heartedness dye; and except the Foundation of War and Strife be removed, and the Foundation of Peace and happy Government be raised up amongst men. Again, True Peace and Settlement in good Government can never be, except the Lord alone be owned as Judge and Law-giver, and his righteous Laws to be executed in the Earth; that Justice and true Judgment may flow down, and all the contrary may be stopped and limitted by the just Laws of God; and all unjust and unequal Laws (made and established in the Ignorance of men) which have not been justly according to the Law of God, nor depended thereupon; such Laws must also be made void, judged and cast out, and the Law of God must enter: This must be accomplished, if ever true Settlement in a happy Peace be amongst us: the Laws must be changed, the unjust and unequal cast out, and just and equal Laws brought in▪ for because hereof, while unjust and unequal Laws have been executed in Judgment, therefore have we wanted Settlement and Peace in a happy Government, and the contrary hath been, and will con∣tinue till all unjust, unequal and oppressive Love be discon∣tinued. Again, If ever true Peace and Settlement in a happy Govern∣ment be amongst men▪ Governours, Rulers and Executors of the Law must be Iust persons and Righteous men, Men that fear God, and hate Covetousness, and that depart from every evil way; and all ambitious, self-seeking, and unjust men must be cast out, even all they that have sought themselves, and not the Lord, in their places of Trust; such as have perverted Justice and true Judgment for their own corrupted ends; and such as have been cruel and hard-hearted Oppressors; all such as these must be cast out, and the Law must not be committed to such to execute, nei∣ther must such sit in Judgement over the People; for because hereof, and while such men have ruled and governed, and exe∣cuted the Laws, no true Settlement in a Just Government, but the contrary hath been, even Distractions and Tribulations; and while such men do continue to rule and judge, and execute the Laws in any part of the world, we shall never have a happy Go∣vernment nor Settlement in it in this world; nor till Just men,
that have the Spirit of God, and sound Judgment, that are hum∣ble and meek, patient and merciful, and such as fear the Lord, and walk in his wayes, be called to rule and judge, and execute the Laws; and the Laws must be just and holy, and the Execu∣tors of them equal and upright men. Till these things be ac∣complished, a happy Settlement in this Worlds Kingdoms can never be, but God will dash one Mountain against another, and throw one Hill upon another; and he will give no Peace among the Kings of the Earth, but stain the Glory of all the Worlds Governments, till Truth and Righteousness come to reign, and till Just Laws be executed by Just men, and till Mercy and Ju∣stice, Truth and Equity flow forth abundantly. Therefore all Nations, you have been deceived while you have turned up and down, from one way and manner and kind of Go∣vernment to another, and from one sort of Governours to o∣thers: sometimes you have been for a Parliament; sometime for a Protector; and sometime for neither: from each of these to others you have changed, thinking to have Peace and Settlement in a happy Government; but it could not be: for there are continual Distractions until this day in the minds of men, and they are yet unsetled in their spirits; and there are Heart-burnings, and Envyings, and seeking of Revenge; and while these things are, nothing but Distractions and Tribulations; not Peace, but Troubles, even till these things be removed; And till we have just and equal Laws, according to the Law of God, established over us, and Just, and Holy, and Righteous men to execute them in Judgement upon us; and till we have Truth and Righteousness sit on the Throne; until this be, no true Settlement in a happy Government; but Distractions and Contentions, and woful Tribulations in the Kingdoms of the World, and amongst men; and this is certain, and according unto the Will of the Lord: and in the justness of his Judge∣ments these things come to passe; for it is Injustice and Op∣pressions, and want of Mercy and Truth, which is the Founda∣tion of Contentions and Distractions; and it is Justice and Equity, Truth and Righteousness, that is the only Foundation of Peace and Settlement, and a happy Government for a per∣petual continuance.
To all False Christia THere are many false wayes in the world, and many false kinds of Religions, and people are in much disagreement about their Church, Worship and Ministry; Papists are opposing the Protestents, and the Protestants the Papists; and there is a great contention in the World. But the Papists are in a wrong way, and so are the Protestants too; and their Religions are both false in many things; for whilst they profess Christ and Christianity, and make a shew of Righteousness in outward appearance, yet many of them live in sinful wayes, and bring forth the fruits of Iniquity against the living God, and Pride, Cheat∣ing, and Double-dealing, Covetousness and Envy, Drunkenness and Whore∣dom, and all Wickedness is abounding and brought forth, both by the Apostate Christians, though they cry up the Name of Christ, and the Profession of God∣liness, yet are they wicked in the sight of God, and they are not changed in heart and mind, nor do they know the New Birth; and all such are out of the right way, in the way of Errour, if they have the Form of Godliness, but want the Power; though they may have Masse, or say Common-prayer once a week, or oftner, yet all this is but Abomination and Deceit, whilst they pra∣ctise Iniquity, Hatred, Back biting, Lying, Drunkenness, and the like; they that act these things, the Plagues of God will be their portion, and Misery their end, and their Profession in Religion will not save them. The Day of the Lord is at hand, ye Hypocrites, ye false Christians, ye that profess God with your lips, and your hearts are far away: Therefore repent ye and tremble before the Lord, lest he smite you with Vengeance: and forsake your false Religions, both your Masse, and your Forms of Prayer; and be not Idolaters, in professing love in your mouthes, and honour with your lips, whilst your hearts are departed from the living God; and now come to learn the true Religion: Depart from all Iniquity, and do not lye, nor swear, nor be drunk, nor steal, nor murder, nor envy; but love the Lord with all your hearts, and your Neigh∣bour as your selves: And this is the true Religion, in which man may be saved, and live in Soberness, Meekness and Honesty, and speak every man Truth to his Neighbour, and live in love one with another, and be kind and gentle, and bring forth the fruits of the Spirit of God; Cease to do evil, and learn to do well, and depart from all Iniquity, and follow after Righteousness: This is true Religion, and in it you may be saved: this is the right way, all that walk in it shall have Peace and Blessing from God; and all that walk contrary, Damnation is their portion: Therefore you Papists and Protestants (so called) turn from your Hy∣pocrisie, and learn this way, and cease from your false worships, that are after the Forms and Traditions of men, and not after the Spirit of God; and learn to wor∣ship God in the Spirit, that you may be saved: You have a Light from Christ in your consciences, which lets you see what sins ye are guilty of, and it reproves you for your sin: If you beliee in the Light, and walk in it that is the right way, then you will deny what is evil, and follow what is good in your Cover∣sations, but if you follow what is evil, and act contrary to the Light in your Consciences, and repent nor. Vengeance in flames of fire will be your portion. This is the day of your Visitation, the Army of the Lamb is gone forth, and the Sword of the Spirit is drawn amongst them, that will wound your Conscien∣ces, and God will smite you with the words of his mouth, ye Rocks, and Hils, and Bryars and Thorns, and fruitless Trees, the God of Heaven will hew you to pieces, and pluck you up, and oast you into the fire to be consumed. Repons, for the Day of the Lord is at hand. THE END.
