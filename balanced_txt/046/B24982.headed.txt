J R GOD SAVE THE KING HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon surmounted by a crown and flanked by theTudor rose on one side and the Scottish thistle on the other HIS MAJESTIES GRACIOUS DECLARATION. JAMES R. OƲr Conduct has been such in all times, as ought to have persuaded the world▪ that we are firm, and constant to Our Resolutions: yet that easie People may not be abused by the Malice of Cra∣fty Wicked Men, We think fit to Declare, That Our Intentions are not changed since the Fourth of April 1687. when We Issued out Our De∣claration for Liberty of Conscience, in the following Terms. His Majesties Gracious Declaration to all His Loving Subjects, for Liberty of Conscience. JAMES R. IT having pleased Almighty God not only to bring Us to the Imperial Crown of these Kingdoms through the greatest difficul∣ties, but to preserve Us by a more than ordinary Providence up∣on the Throne of Our Royal Ancestors; there is nothing now that We so earnestly desire, as to Establish Our Government on such a Foundation, as may make Our Subjects happy, and unite them to Us by Inclination as well as Duty: Which We think can be done by no Means so effectually, as by Granting to them the free Exercise of their Religion for the Time to come, and add that to the perfect enjoyment of their Property, which has never been in any Case invaded by Us, since Our coming to the Crown; which being the two Things Men value most, shall ever be preserved in these Kingdoms, during Our Reign over them,
as the truest Methods of their Peace and Our Glory. We cannot but heartily wish, as it will easily be believed, that all the People of Our Dominions were Members of the Catholick Church; yet we humbly thank Almighty God, it is, and hath of long time been Our constant Sense and Opinion (which upon divers Occasions We have declared) that Conscience ought not to be constrained, nor People forced in mat∣ters of meer Religion: It has ever been directly contrary to Our Inclinati∣on, as We think it is to the Interest of Government, which it destroys by spoiling Trade, depopulating Countries, and discouraging Strangers; and finally, that it never obtained the End for which it was employed: And in this We are the more Confirmed by the Reflections We have made upon the Conduct of the four last Reigns. For after all the frequent and pres∣sing Endeavours that were used in each of them, to reduce this Kingdom to an exact Conformity in Religion, it is visible the Success has not an∣swered the Design, and that the Difficulty is invincible. We therefore out of Our Princely Care and Affection unto all Our Loving Subjects, that they may live at Ease and Quiet, and for the increase of Trade, and in∣couragement of Strangers, have thought fit by vertue of our Royal Pre∣rogative, to issue forth this Our Declaration of Indulgence; making no doubt of the Concurrence of Our Two Houses of Parliament, when We shall think it convenient for them to Meet. In the first Place We do declare, That We will Protect and Maintain Our Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and Clergy, and all other Our Subjects of the Church of England, in the free Exercise of their Religion, as by Law Established, and in the quiet and full Enjoyment of all their Possessi∣ons, without any Molestation or Disturbance whatsoever. We do likewise Declare, That it is Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That from henceforth the Execution of all and all manner of Penal Laws in Matters Ecclesiastical, for not coming to Church, or not Receiving the Sacrament, or for any other Non-conformity to the Religion Established, or for, or by Reason of the Exercise of Religion in any manner whatsoe∣ver, be immediately Suspended; And the further Execution of the said Penal Laws and every of them is hereby Suspended. And to the end that by the Liberty hereby granted, the Peace and Security of Our Government in the Practice thereof, may not be indan∣gered, We have thought fit, and do hereby straitly Charge and Command all Our Loving Subjects, That as We do freely give them Leave to Meet and Serve God after their own way and manner, be it in Private Houses or Places purposely Hired or Built for that use; so that they take especial care, that nothing be Preached or Taught amongst them which may any ways tend to Alienate the Hearts of Our People from Us or Our Government; And that their Meetings and Assemblies be peaceably, openly, and pub∣lickly held, and all Persons freely admitted to them; And that they do sig∣nifie and make known to some one or more of the next Justices of the Peace, what Place or Places they set apart for those uses. And that all Our Subjects may enjoy such their Religious Assem∣blies with greater Assurance and Protection, We have thought it requisite, and do hereby Command, That no Disturbance of any kind be made or given unto them, under Pain of Our Displeasure, and to be further pro∣ceeded against with the uttermost Severity.
And for as much as We are desirous to have the benefit of the Service of all Our Loving Subjects, which by the Law of Nature is inseparably annexed to, and inherent in Our Royal Person: And that none of Our Subjects may for the future be under any Discouragement or Disability, (who are otherwayes well inclined and fit to serve Us) by reason of some Oaths or Tests, that have been usually Administred on such Occasions: We do hereby further Declare, That it is Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That the Oaths commonly called, The Oaths of Supremacy and Allegi∣ance, and also the several Test and Declarations mentioned in the Acts of Parliament made in the 25th and 30th years of the Reign of Our late Royal Brother King Charles the Second, shall not at any time hereafter be required to be Taken, declaired, or subscribed by any Person or Persons whatsoever, who is or shall be Imployed in any Office or Place of Trust either Civil or Military, under Us or in Our Government. And We do further Declare it to be Our Pleasure and Intention from time to time here∣after, to Grant Our Royal Dispensations under Our Great Seal to all Our Loving Subjects so to be Imployed, who shall not take the said Oaths, or Subscribe or declare the said Tests or Declarations in the abovementioned Acts, and every of them. And to the end that all Our Loving Subjects may receive and enjoy the full Benefit and Advantage of Our Gracious Indulgence hereby intended, and may be Acquited and Discharg'd from all Pains, Penalties, Fore∣feitures, and Disabilities by them or any of them Incurr'd or Forefeited, or which they shall or may at any time hereafter be liable to, for or by reason of their Non-conformity, or the Exercise of their Religion, and from all Suits, Troubles, or Disturbances for the same: We do hereby give Our Free and Ample Pardon, unto all Non-conformists, Recusants, and other our Loving Subjects, for all Crimes and Things by them Com∣mited or done contrary to the Penal Laws formerly made, relating to Religion, and the Profession or Exercise thereof. Hereby Declaring, That this Our Royal Pardon and Indemnity shall be as good and effectual to all Intents and Purposes, as if every individual Person had been therein particularly nam'd, or had particular Pardons under our Great Seal, which We do likewise Declare, shall from time to time be Granted unto any Person or Persons desiring the same: Willing and Requiring Our Judges, Justices, and other Officers, to take Notice of and obey Our Royal Will and Pleasure herein before Declared. And although the Freedom and Assurance We have hereby given in relation to Religion and Property might be sufficient to remove from the Minds of Our Loving Subjects all Fears and Jealousies in relation to either; Yet We have thought fit further to Declare, That we will mantain them in all their Properties and Possessions, as well of Church and Aby-Lands, as in any other their Lands and Properties whatsoever. Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Fourth Day of April, 1687. In the Third Year of Our Reign.
EVer since We granted this Indulgence, We have made it our principal Care to see it preserved without Distinction; as we are encouraged to do daily by Multitudes of Addresses, and many o∣ther Assurances We receive from Our Subjects of all Perswasions, as Testimonies of their Satis∣faction and Duty; the Effects of which We doubt not but the next Parliament will pliainly shew; and that it will not be in vain that We have Resolved to use Our uttermost endeavours to Establish Liberty of Conscience on such just and equal Foundations, as will render it unalterable, and secure to all People the free Exercise of their Religion for ever; by which future Ages may reap the benefit of what is so undoub∣tedly for the General Good of the whole Kingdom. It is such a Security We desire without the burthen and constrain of Oaths and Tests, which have been unhappily made by some Govermnents, but could never Support any; nor should men be advanced by such means to Offices and Imployments, which ought to be the Reward of Services, Fidelity and Merit. We must conclude, That not only good Christi∣ans will joyn in this, but whoever is concerned for the encrease of the Wealth and Power of the Nation. It would perhaps prejudice some of our Neighbours, who might lose part of those vast advantages they now enjoy, if Liberty of Conscience were settled in these Kingdoms, which are above all others most ca∣pable of Improvements, and of commanding the Trade of the World: In pursuance of this great Work, We have been forced to make many Changes both of Civil and Military Officers throughout Our Do∣minions, not thinking any ought to be imployed in Our Service, who will not contribute towards the Establishing the Peace and Greatness of their Countrey, which We most earnestly desire, as unbyas'd Men may see by the whole Conduct of our Government, and by the Condition of our Fleet, and of Our Armies; which with good Management shall be constantly the same, and greater, if the Safety or Honour of the Nation require it. We recommend these Considerations to all Our Subjects, and that they will reflect on their present Ease and Happiness, how for above three Years that it has pleased God to permit us to Reign over these Kingdoms, We have not appeared to be that Prince, Our Enemies would have made the World afraid of. Our chief Aim having been not to be the Oppressor, but the Father of Our People; of which We can give no better Evidence, than by Conjuring them to lay aside all private Animosities as well as groundless Jealousies, and to choose such Members of Parliament as may do their part to finish what We have begun for the Advantage of the Monarchy, over which Almighty God hath placed Us, being resolved to call a Parliament that shall meet in November next, at furthest. Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Twenty seventh day of April, 1688, In the Fourth Year of Our Reign. By His Majesties special Command. HOLY-ROOD-HOUSE, Re-Printed by Mr. P. B.
