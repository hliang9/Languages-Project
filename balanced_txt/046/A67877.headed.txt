TO THE READER. THE late Learned Mr. H. Wharton, when he publish'd the History of the Troubles and Tryal of Arch-Bishop Laud, in the Year 1695, finding that all the Papers to be printed with that Work could not be brought within the compass of one Volume, reserv'd these for a Second Part: If God had pleas'd to continue his life, they had been publish'd much sooner, together with such an account of them as he would have thought necessary: But he was preven∣ted in so good a Work by that stubborn and incura∣ble Distemper of which he dyed. In his Last Will all the Manuscript Papers relating to Arch-Bishop Laud are order'd forthwith to be deliver'd to his Father, (the Reverend Mr. Edmund Wharton, now Rector of Saxlingham in Norfolk,) that so he might cause them to be transcrib'd, and fitted for the Press: In complyance therefore with that his dying Request, these Papers are now sent into the World.

Tenor autem Orationis Reverendissimi Domini Cancellarii sequitur in haec verba. NON expectatis, scio, Viri Literatissimi, cultissimi Academici, ut long a The Chancel∣or's Speech. vos aut comptâ Oratione excipiam. Fateor, Amor vester & Merita omnia possunt à me jure vendicare: Sed hinc àesuetudo perorandi, illinc stylus parùm rotundus, hinc lingua haesitans, illinc memoria febre non lassata modò, sed & penitùs exusta, mihi abundè impedimento sunt. Loquendum tamen mihi est, & in hâc Doctissimorum Coronâ, quâ cinctus sum: Loquendum; sed quàm laxo Stylo, parùm refert, quum vos in supplementum Oratorem, & gravem & dulcem, attulistis. Mihi non vacat esse tam diserto, nec facilè invenio, unde incipiam, adeó me distrahit dicendorum copia. Gratiae, scio, agendae sunt Vobis, & almae illi Academiae, quae corpore quodam abbreviato Vos estis. Et gratias ago, non  lingua mea promere didicit (exiles illae!) sed quas Cor vestrum ni∣mis in me propensum potest concipere. Magnum est, quod in me contulistis, Munus, verè magnum, & quo multi Heroës  dum fruebantur, non levi se honore auctos existimârunt: Nec mirum; cum in tam altum Parnassi locum ascendere, est omnia accipere, quae Musae dare possunt. Atque hic succurrit mihi Illustrissimus ille Heros, mihi nunquam sine Ho∣noris praefatione dicendus, cajus praesidio nuperrimè orbata est Academia.  Vobis & Patronus & Pater extitit: Patronus, Vos & Vestra pro posse (quod magnum fuit) defendendo; Pater, se & sua donando; nec vulgaria illa, sed quae haberi ullibi vix poterant, sumptu non parvo emit, ut daret. Notius est, quam ut Teste indigeat, nihil Ei magis charum fuisse, quam Salutem, Honorem, & Faelicitatem istius florentis Academiae. Decessit Ille sibi suo tempore; Nobis heu  cit ò decessit: Quem Rex serenis∣simus fidelissimum,  observantissimum, Ecclesia amicissimum, Acade∣mia beneficientissimum semper experta est. Ego, quum Eum à primo ferè in Au∣lam ingressu Maecenatem semper habui constantem & prudentissimum; nunc ve-Vestro munere ipsi succenturiatus sum. Onus eo gravius humeris meis impositum sentio, quòd Viro tam Claro, Vobis tam charo, Successor sim futurus. Sed quiescit Ille in suo & omnium Domino. Redeundum est; nam dum do∣leo Clarissimum Virum oculis ereptum nostris, paenè oblitus sum mei. Sed me∣mini dixisse me, magnum esse, quod in me contulistis, Munus sine dubio magnum; seipso tamen, modum rei si perpendamus, Majus. Contulistis e∣nim Cancellariatum Academiae vestrae ante hac, & saepius; sed semper Mag∣num in Magnos contulistis. Et Honor iste semper ascendebat, descendebat nun∣quam, usquedum nunc in me; nec solùm in me Minorem, sed & immerentem, sed & prorsus nescientem; addo etiam (non ut beneficio quicquam detraham, sed ut affectus vestros indicem) Nolentem, & contra meipsum omni conatu (Deum & conscientias quorundam astantium testor) molientem, descende∣bat. Amoris vestri impetus hic fuit; cui nunquam par ero, ut me in gre∣mium Matris meae Vestrae{que} reduceretis Quod Vobis faustum, precor, sit;  mihi non potest non esse pergratissimum, sic, & tam fervidis affectibus, ho∣norari.
Vnum tamen placuit vobis errorem, eum{que} magnam, (sicu t solet errare, quùm errat, Amor) Amori vestro immiscere; Ipsam nempe mei Electio∣nem. Nisi enim me augurium fallat, & sim falsus animi, meliùs multo con∣sultum foret Vobis & Academiae, fortasse & mihi, si hunc honoris, fateor, sed & invidiae cumulum, in alivs & fortiores humeros placuisset imponere. Quippe poterat Munere isto (quod hîc collocasse, quid aliud paenè est, quàm perdidisse?) Novus aliquis, & qui plus posset, Patronus conciliari. Ad me verò quod attinet, non indigebam his stimulis, qui, etiam ante hunc col∣latum honorem reputabam me quasi unum è Vobis: Nec erat quitquam intra sphoeram activitatis meae, ad quod praestandum sponte non fuerim paratissi∣mus. Adeò ut hoc tam ingenti Beneficio, actione quidem Amoris vinculo me vobis devinctum agnoscam, promptiore verò ad benefaciendum animo, non sentiam. Videtis, ut Amoris vestri sive error sive aestus, Navem Academiae guber∣nandam tradidit homini, cui benè Velle quidem adest, caeterùm nec Ars sup∣petit, nec Rudentes, nec Anchora satis firma. Quae spes ita{que} appellendi ad portum, si qua fortè oboriatur Tempestas? certe nulla; nisi Rex, pro innat â suâ erga Literas & Literatos bonitate, quam à Patre piissimae memorioe & Regum, dum vixit, doctissimo hausit, dignetur Ipse Maecenas  audire, & me sibi constituere sequestrem in iis, quoe ad Vos spectabunt; Imò nisi pro misericordiâ illâ, quoe est super omnia opera ejus, plusquam aliquid descendat à Rege Regum & Domino Dominantium, Ille, spero, quà est Pater Luminum à quo omne datum, quod bonum, aperiet oculos meos, ut videam, diriget gressus meos, ut sequar ea quae Academiae Matri meae, semper honorandae, & Vobis Confratribus meis utilissima, amplissima, honoratissima futura sunt. Reliquum est, ut Vos, Viri gravissimi, Seniores Israëlis nostri, (nam  Moses solus potuit omnia) humeros vestros unà mecum supponatis oneri. Et nisi it à faciatis, Deus bone! in quales quantas angustias me conjecistis? Sed videtur vel ipse Aspectus hic Academicus nescic quid boni mihi polliceri; eundem nempe Amorem, majorem, (si fieri potest) & non, ut anteà, er∣rantem, in exhibendo mihi auxilium, quod & Vos deceat, & me sublevet. Et certè, ipsa Academia (quâ nescio quid mihi charius esse potest) doctri∣nâ simul & moribus, pietate simul & sobrietate, pace simul & unitate, sit in omne aevum florentissima, in Vobis aequè ac in me situm erit. Acade∣mia enim tot ditata Collegiis, quot & qualibus vix dotata est quaelibet per Europam alia, non aliunde pejus audit, quàm ex fractà & jacente quasi Disciplinâ. Eam de postliminio restituite, reducite in gratiam vestram; & antiquam statim videbitis Academiae pulchritudinem. Ne{que} enim Anus haec canitie vener and a rugas novit contrahere, nisi prae moerore & anxie∣tate ob collapsam Disciplinam. Sunt, quae hic plura dicerem. Sed Dies serenus est; & talis, opto, sit Vobis & mihi. Nolo Diem hunc querelis obnubilare; quae ne tunc quidem sunt gratae, quùm forsan necessariae. Opto omnibus, singulis Vobis,  universo, salutem, serenitatem, quam nulla unquam nubila tempeslas, quae undi{que} perflare humana solet, aut abscondat aut .
Concludam cum Apostolo: De caetero, Fratres, Quaecun{que} sunt vera, quaecun{que} pudica, quaecun{que} justa, quaecun{que} Sancta, quaecun{que} ama∣bilia, quaecun{que} bona sunt: Addo, Quaecun{que} ad aedificationem Ecclesiae Christi, quacun{que} ad obedienl am erga Christium Domini, quaecun{que} ad pi∣etatem, & pacem populi Dei pertinent: Si qua virtus, si qua laus discipli∣nae; haec cogitate, haec agite ad unum Omnes. Et pax Dei, quae exuperat omnem sensum, custodiat corda vestra & intelligentias vestras in Christo Jesu ad vitam aeternam. Amen. So soon as I was admitted to the Chancellorship (which God know's I little expected) I thought it my Duty to reform the University, which was extremely sunk from all Discipline, and fallen into all Licentiousness: Insomuch that divers of the Governours there complained to me, that if remedy were not applied in time, there would scarce any face be left of a University. Hereupon I resolved within my self to set close to a Reformation. And though I understood most of the Defects of the University (as having lived there many years, and for divers of them a Governour): Yet the first thing I thought fit to do, was to lay Order taken for weekly Letters from the Vicechan∣cellour. a Command upon the Vicechancellour for the time being, that he should give me an account by Letters every week of all necessary Occurren∣ces which happened in the University, pertaining to Exercise or Man∣ners: with a Promise, that he should weekly, without fail, receive a Letter from me, expressing what I dislik'd or approv'd, and with Directions what should further be done for the good of That Place. This Course I constanly held, and found so much good by it, that I resolved, as often as I made a New Vice-Chancellour, to renew the like Charge, and to pursue it with like diligence. Which, when time serv'd, I did, and shall (God willing) so continue to do, as long as I shall live Chancellour of the University. The Statutes of the University had lain in a confused heap for some Concerning the making and settling the Sta∣tutes. Ages, and extremely imperfect in all kinds. The Reformation of the Abuses, which grew thereby, and the reducing of the Statutes into Order and Form, with the Addition of some New, for the neces∣sity of the Present times, had been often attempted, and particulary by Cardinal Woolsey and other Great Men in their several times; but was never brought to any perfection; nor indeed to any thing at all: But the business left, where it was first undertaken. I did ever foresee, that it was not possible to make a Reformation, or settle That Body, unless the Statutes were first perfected. And yet it was evident also, what great difficulties attended That work: For it had been twice undertaken during my own time in the University; and both times it came to nothing. At the Last time it was attempted, I was Named in Convocation one of the Delegates my self. By which means I had op∣portunity to see, where the difficulties and impediments lay, but was not then able to remove them. Afterwards coming to be Bishop of London, and finding my Lord the Earl of Pembrock much troubled at some unworthy proceedings There; I told him, he would never have remedy, until the Statutes of the University were reduced into a Body
and setled: And withal acquainted his Lordship, wherein the Diffi∣culties lay. Hereupon, at his entreaty, I set down, what way was to be taken and followed for effecting That work: And began at the na∣ming of the Delegacy below in Convocation. Which Delegacy was no sooner nam'd, and my Directions sent unto them, but my Lord of Pembroke died, and I was chosen Chancellour after him, and took up this work, where it was then left, and resolved to go on against all Difficulties, which were like to oppose me in the Body of that Univer∣sity: Which, being very sick, was desirous enough to be well, but not pleased with the sourness of the Cure. Besides, such Bodies never want Factions; and many There, that were willing enough to have a Cure, were not so well pleas'd, it should be wrought by my hand. But This and many other Difficulties I overcame with Care and Pa∣tience; and went on with the work. S. in Christo. AFter my hearty Commendations &c. I am given to understand, To Dr. Tolson the Vicechan∣cellour's De∣puty about two disorderly Sermons. that on Sunday last I was wellcomed into my Chancellourship of Oxford with two very ill Accidents, in either Sermon one. The first, I hear, was committed by one of Exeter College, who preach'd direct∣ly against all Reverence in Churches, and all Obeysance, or any devout gesture in or at the receiving of the Communion. And if this be true, belike we shall not kneel neither. The other, as I am informed, was by one Mr. Tucker of your own Col∣lege; who was not content only to justifie the Five Articles, common∣ly called Arminianism, but he would needs lay an Aspersion upon the Synod of Dort. In both which he hath directly gone against his Ma∣jesties both Proclamation and Instructions, prohibiting all men of all sorts for a time to preach either way concerning them; that so those unhappy Differences, likely to rend this Church, as well as others, might sleep first, and dye after. I know not, whether Mr. Vicechancellour did convent these men or no. If he did, your labour is past: If he did not, then I pray do you: and take two or three Doctors to you. I would not be too sour at my first coming-in: And yet I would not have Sermons of such ill example lead the way into my Government There. I hope, a strict Monition, that they run no more into these Errours, will serve the turn for this first time. But if you find, that it will not, then I pray go so much farther, as the carriage of the men and the merits of their cause shall require. I know, these Sermons were provided before I was Chancellour, but yet I know too, that the blame will fall on me more than upon another man, if such things as these pass without Censure. I pray, as you shew'd your Love to choose me, so be careful to maintain my honour in upholding the Peace and the Government of the Place. For God knows, what blustring may follow upon That unhappy accident of Mr. Tucker's.
Thus not doubting of your Care herein, I leave you to the Grace of God. And shall ever rest, LONDON House. May 7. 1630. Your very Loving Friend, GVIL. London. S. in Christo. AFter my hearty Commendations &c. your Deputy, Dr. Tolsen, To Dr. Frewin Vicechancel∣lor, about ob∣serving For∣malities. hath done very well in some Business in your absence, which I hope you will perfect. Now I have a little more Business for you, in which I must desire you to have a special Care. I am given to understand, that Formalities (which are in a sort the outward and visible Face of the University) are in a manner utterly decayed, not only abroad in the Streets, but also in the very Schools, Convocation and Congregation-houses, and at Latin Sermons: In somuch that strangers, which come thither, have scarce any external Mark, by which they may know they are in a University. If this go on, the University will lose ground every day both at home and abroad; and especially with his Majesty, who is a great Lover of Order and De∣cency in all Seminaries of good Learning. And he hath already given  strict charge to look both to this and other particulars in their several times. I pray therefore call the Heads of Colleges and Halls together with the Proctors, and read these Letters to them; and with my Love remembr'd to them all, let them know I am welcom'd into my Chan∣cellourship with many complaints from very great men. I hope, all are not true: And I hope, such as are, you and they will All in your several Houses joyn pains and hearty endeavous to see them rectifi'd, as I shall in due time severally propose them. At this time I think it necessary, the Heads should fairly bespeak their several Companies to fit themselves with Formalities fitting their Degrees, that when the Act comes, (God bless you with Health, that it may hold with honour and safety) the University may have Credit by looking like it self: And then I doubt not but it will be it self too. For it will not endure but to be, as it seems. And I desire you would bespeak your Companies fairly. Both, because I presume, most men There in their generous and liberal Education will be such lovers of Order, that they will run to the practice: And because I heartily desire, that as I am chosen Chancellour with a great deal of unexpected Love; so I may be enabled ever to Govern with a like measure of it. My heart ever was, and I hope ever shall be, set to do That Place all the good I can. And I shall take it for one of God's greatest Tempo∣ral
blessings upon me, if I may have your joint Concurrence to perfect the good I wish. And I will not doubt, but that you do so love and honour That our Venerable Mother, that you will cheerfully afford me This assistance. When you have made this Entrance for Formalities at the Act, (for which I now give time and warning) then the better to settle them, and all other Points of Government, I pray take care to go on with the Delegacy for the Statutes, that there may be a setled and a Known Body of them. My ever honoured Predecessour began That work with Care. I know, you will give me leave to pursue it to your good and His honour. In the next long Vacation it were happy, if that Body of Statutes might be finish'd. But whether it can or not, I hearti∣ly pray you against Michaelmas Term look the Register, and provide such Tables, as were wont to be published upon S. Mary's doors, for observance of the known Statutes, and that then you proceed to the execution of them accordingly. I know, you and the Governours There will pardon me this Care, when you shall know what lies upon me here, and what begins alrea∣dy to be expected from me by a most Gracious Prince, who is very Zelous of the honour of That Place. And this yet I shall promise and perform. I will not be sudden upon you, nor  with you in any your businesses Neither will I proceed in any thing, but that which shall promote the honour and good of your selves and That fa∣mous University. And in this way he that gives me best assistance shall be most welcome to me. So for this time I take my leave: Com∣mending you All to God's gracious Protection; and shall rest, May 28. 1630. Your very Loving Friend, GVIL. London. S. in Christo. AFter my hearty Commendations &c. This is the first Occa∣sion, My first Let∣ters to the Convocation. which I have had to trouble the Convocation. And before I begin with the Business, I think it very fit to give you all very hearty thanks for the great Love and undeserved Favour, which you would needs bestow upon me, quite beyond my Expectation, and cross to my desires. Yet since it hath pleased God so to dispose both of you and me in this business, I shall endeavour to the utmost of my power to answer your expectation, and to discharge the burden of this Honour to as much advantage of That Venerable Mother of my self and you, as the best understanding I have can lead me to. And whensoever any thing shall come to your knowledge, in which I may do That Body service, I hope you will not fail to acquaint me with it, and in such time as the opportunity of doing what is fit may not be lost. Else I
may be disenabled to serve you by your own default. But these are but Verbal Thanks; and I have desired to be as real as I might; and therefore shall trouble you with no more of this. The Business I am to acquaint you with is, to let you know, that A  in Christ Church given to the Hebrew Read∣er for ever. his Majesty did very graciously accept your Letter of Thanks for the  bestowed upon the Hebrew=Reader: Whose Patent I caused to be sent, and approved by you, before I would suffer the Seal to pass. And now it is pass't, and That Place so both enriched and honoured, I hope you will take care that the Reader thereof, as well as the rest, do the Duty of his Place. For the study of That Language is too much neglected, and not without the great prejudice both of That Uni∣versity and the Church. Since this, I have received from you the Book of Verses in honour of the Prince, which I have likewise delivered to his Majesty, with a full representation of your humble and dutiful Respects to his Ma∣jesty, and of your hearty Prayers both for himself and his Royal Poste∣rity: Which he, with all Grace and Favour accepted. I could hear∣tily have wish'd, the Book had been here any time of the last week, that it might have prevented the Christning. But howsoever, 'tis very welcome Now. It is not long, since I writ to Mr. Vicechancellour about some care The observing of Formalities. to be taken for Formalities, both against the Act, and so after to con∣tinue at Michaelmas Term. And I make no doubt, but all men will be willing to continue the honour of That Place, and in That kind. It is the Hedg and the Fence of those things, which are of far greater consequence. In those Letters I omitted one thing, which I think fit now to be remember'd. It is a great Abuse, and long continued against the Degree of a Master of Arts. I know, 'tis very fit, that That De∣gree, upon which the Orders of the University do so much rely, both in Convocations, Congregations, and elsewhere, should be had in more esteem than it is. But this can no ways so well be done, as by their due Obedience to Governours in their several Places, and by their own Valuing and Esteeming themselves above all Inferiours. And for my part, I shall do my best to keep up the price they set upon themselves. For 'tis a great dishonour to That Place, that in all Publick Assemblies, yea and when they meet in open street, Bachelours of Art, nay Boys, will not know their places. I hope, the Delegacy will so order the Statutes, which they have in hand (to the lasting honour of my most Worthy and Honourable Predecessour) as that the Degree of a Master of Arts shall hereafter be better esteemed in That Place; which is the only way to recover the ancient Credit of it Abroad. The last thing which I have at this time to recommend unto you, is, The not spoll∣ing of his Ma∣jesty's Game. that you would All be careful, that the University may stand right in his Majesties Good Opinion for not spoiling His Game. There was very lately a Complaint made to me about it: and I, fearing the worst, writ to the Vicechancellour: But he gave me so discreet and so sufficient an Answer, that I not only did, but had cause to think all
was well. Since this, I find that Complaint, or some other, hath gone farther. I heartily pray you therefore to take the best care you can, especially You, that are Governours and in Office, to look to the Abuses tho, and then with Gods assistance I will take care, that no man's sinister Report shall do you prejudice Here. Thus not doubting of the Love, and Affection, the Care, and the Moderation of any man for the Good and the Honour of That most noble Body; I leave you all to the Grace of God, and shall ever rest, To my very Loving Friends, the Vicechancellour, the Doctors, the Proctours, and the rest of the Convocation of the Vnivsierty of Oxford. Your very loving Friend and Chancellour, GVIL. London. S. in Christo. AFter my hearty Commendations &c. The time now draws on for Dr. Smith Warden of Wadham Col∣lege apopinted Vicechancel∣lour. the Nomination of a New Vicechancellour according to the Course held by my Honourable Predecessours in That famous University. In this little time, in which by your Favours I have had the Honour to Govern, I have found the present Vicechancellour Dr. Frewen so Careful and so Discrect in That buisy Place, that I should, though Dr. Smith. it were to his great pains, put him to the trouble of another year, were it not, that I consider, how full of able and sufficient men the University is for the Discharge of That Office. Besides, I have ever thought it most for the Honour and the Profit of the University, that the Governours there should have the pains and the experience of That Place divided amongst them. In which Resolution I shall still continue, till I shall receive better reason to the contrary, than I can give my self. For this present year therefore I have thought sit to lay the Burden of This Place upon Dr Smith, the Warden of Wadham College: And do so chuse him thereunto, as a Man whose Integrity and Abilities to Govern I have known and observed for divers years. These are therefore to Pray and Require you to Allow of this my Choice; and to give him your best Advice and Assis∣tance both in this and all other Business, which shall concern the Good and Honour of That famous University. And so I bid you heartily farewel; and rest, To my Loving  the Vicechancellour, the Doctors, the Proctours, and the rest of the Convocation of the Vniversity of Oxford. FULHAM-House. July 9. 1630. Your very Loving Friend and Chancellour, GVIL. London.

Reverendissimae vestrae Clementiae addictissimus, Johannes Morris. AGainst the beginning of your Term, and so for Direction of all the year, I shall be bold to give you these few Advertisements following, till the Statutes may be perfected. First, I pray keep it in memory with the Heads, that there be no Certain Adver∣tisements given the Vicechancel∣lour at Michael∣mas , Oc∣tob. 6: 1630. more Gowns made out of the ancient Fashion of the University. Secondly, That no Man have his Degree, till he hath done all his Exercise, under what pretence soever. Thirdly, That you admit none to Cumulate. Fourthly, That no man be suffer'd to proceed Bachelour of Divinity that is not Master of Arts, unless he have staid full 14 years, since his being Bachelour of Arts: nor any Bachelour of Law to be Bachelour of Divinity, unless he have spent as many years in the University, as he should have done, if he had gone the longer and the more chargeable way by the Arts. Last of all, You shall do very well to make Congregations fewer, and let them draw their busi∣ness
together, and not trouble the whole University and your self so often for every Boy's business. I pray, be strict in these; and if it be the cause, you have fewer Doctors the next year, the matter is not great. For if there be none for a year or two, there are enough already for a longer time. And for my part, I am as willing there should be none, as to have the University disordered by them. THis day I received a complaint from Oxford, concerning the Re∣straint, An Order De accumulandis Gradibus. Octob. 11. 1630. which I had advised should be put upon Dispensations, which were then grown too common in all kinds, to the great dis∣grace of the University. But in the consideration of this Point there arose some Debate concerning the Dispensatiens de accumulandis Gra∣dibus, by reason, that some were come to the University to Accumulate, which dwelt in remoter parts, and were now ready to do their Ex∣ercise, and could not be sent back without their Degrees, but it must needs tend to their great disreputation, charge, and prejudice. In re∣gard whereof there was earnest suit made to me by Dr. Prideaux, then the Kings Professour in Divinity, and by Mr. Bell, Esquire-Bedell in Arts, that this restraint de accumulandis Gradibus might not be sud∣denly put upon the University: but that there might be a Day pre∣fix'd and warning given, that so no man might be taken upon the suddain; As appears by Dr. Prideaux his Letter, which hereafter fol∣lows. In the mean time I presenty settled this Difficulty with such a moderate Restraint as in short time effected, what I intended, and presently took off all further muttering in the University. Right Reverend Father in God, ON Friday last Mr. Vice-Chancellour acquainted us amongst others Dr. Prideaux his Letter De Accumulandis Gradibus. with your Honours Advertisements, with your Dislike of Ac∣cumulating Degrees, which heretofore hath been too Customary. We must all acknowledge with Thankfulness your Fatherly Care, and Gods Blessing through your wisdom and vigilance, in reforming many things, which were out of frame. For my own part, I shall hold him an unworthy Member of This Place, that with all readi∣ness conforms not himself to such warrantable and fit Proposals; and should be loth, that any man be more forward than my self in per∣forming all due Obedience to my Superiours. But I trust, your Ho∣nour will not take amiss, if I interpose thus far: That sufficient No∣tice be first given of your Pleasure in this behalf, before execution be urged. I speak it to this purpose. Here is one Mr. Balye, an able Man both for Scholarship and Means, and his Majesties Chaplain, who upon supposal of Accumulating, as heretofore, hath ever since the Act been at great charge Here, and taken pains to perform his Exercise for his Degrees. This was before any intimation from your Lordship of stopping Accumulating: which if it presently take place, his hopes, travels, and expences are frustrated, and his return must be to his great
prejudice. He was a Fellow of Exeter College, of good esteem. There is one Mr. Hodges, a Fellow of Lincoln College, almost in the like case. Our humble suit is, that these Men, thus before engaged, may Pass with your Lordships Leave. Others, as your Wisdom shall think fit, may for the present have Notice given, that they expect not the like Easiness; Especially the Residents Here, whose negligence hath abu∣sed this Favour, meant rather, as I take it, to Strangers of worth, than to them. Of This I held it my Duty to inform your Honour, as de∣sirous to stand in your favourable Opinion with others under this your Government: Amongst whom I shall faithfully endeavour in Realities to express my self, Exon Coll. Octob. 11. 1630. Your Lordship's ready to be commanded, John Prideaux. S. in Christo. Worthy SIR, I Received Letters from you this week. They found me at home My Answer to Dr. Prideaux his Letter de accu∣mulandis gradi∣bus. under some Indisposition of body by reason of a Cold caught in my Court-Attendance. I thank you heartily for your Love, and expression of readiness to join in the necessary upholding of Govern∣ment in that famous University, whose flourishing shall ever be the first and at the highest in my desires. For the particular you mention de Accumulandis gradibus, I am not only content, but thank you for your Interposition: Because as my desire is to Propose nothing, but that which is Just and Honourable for that Place; so I am very willing to Propose it in such manner, as no man of quality may have just cause to except against. In my Indisposition (of which I am not yet free) I must crave your pardon to be Brief, and not write that over again, which I have written in that Point to Mr. Vicechancellour, who, I think, will call you and the rest of the Heads again, and read my Answer, which I make no doubt will settle this business. Yet this I must tell you, Mr. Balye (howsoever you write an honest and an able Gentleman) hath very far and more ways than one forgotten himself to Mr. Vice∣chancellour, and not spared me. For my part I pity his Passion, and shall pass it by, if Mr. Vicechancellour be satisfied. And this I do for his Father's sake, and in hope, that he will make this his Warning; else I would quickly make him know, that my Proposals there are far from Tricks to catch him or any others. You shall discharge your Love to his Father, and your Care of him very freely, if you shall chide him into better Temper.
The main of my Answer I hope you will expect from Mr. Vice∣chancellour, in regard of my present Weakness. And I shall end in a constant belief, that for the Government of the University, and all necessaries incident thereunto, I shall find you very ready and real, as you promise. For which, as I now give you thanks, so of it I shall be ready to give you testimony; and for it to shew you all such respects, as may be due, or fit from the Place I bear; and with as much Favour, as to any Governour in that place. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and shall rest, Fulham-House. Octob. 15. 1630. Your loving Friend, GVIL. London. I write you this with mine own hand. I pray hereafter be very careful of Concerning Act Questions. the Act-Questions. The late Question about the Sickness (though somewhat qualified from the first proposal) was very unreasonable, and some∣what else too. His Majesty took great distast at it, and commanded me to write to you about it. You were at that time gone into the West, and I for∣bare; and do now only give you this private Advertisement, which none knows, but your self: Not doubting but you will make good use of it, and such as is fit. IT seems there are but two rubbs appearing in this first Meeting. A Clause of my Letters to the Vicechan∣cellour de sus∣ceptione Gradûs Baccalur. in SS. Theologiâ. Octob. 15. 1630. The one about a Statute for nine years allowed (it seems) for men not Masters of Arts to be Bachelours in Divinity. I pray search, whe∣ther there be such a Statute or no. If there be not, I think it fit my Order should hold. If there be, I will not violate it; but think it very fit, it should be abrogated. For since seven years is required of a Master of Arts, and Resident in the University, where he may study; I think fourteen years is little enough for a Bachelour of Arts or Un∣der-graduate abroad, who as he went away young, and with less grounds of Learning; so his time being taken up in preaching, must needs be less able for Controversy-learning. And this is all I shall say for That. For Cumulation, I must needs profess, I never lik'd it. And it sup∣poses, De gradibus ac∣cumulandis. of and in it self, an unnecessary Delay of the first Degree, or a needless Hast of the Second. There are two things objected, which makes me take it into second consideration. The one is, that Univer∣sity Records have been search'd, and that time out of mind Cumulati∣ons have been admitted, yea and sometimes by a Statute, provided, that all Exercise for both Degrees were performed. I pray therefore, desire in my name so much patience of the Heads, as to have these Re∣cords viewed by all or some of them appointed thereto by your selves. And if you find it so, then I shall be contented to do, as hereafter fol∣lows. But give me leave to tell you by the way, That though I dislike Cumulations in themselves, yet I do it much more for that, which I
observed, when I was so happy, as to live among you. For then it was common (and some are yet living who Cumulated so) either quite to Dispense with the Exercise of Bachelour of Divinity, (which is the great and necessary exercise of the Town) or turn it but into a Sermon Neither of which I shall endure. The other is, that if I intend to hold the strictness of this Course, it might seem fit, that a time had been prefixt, before it be put in execu∣tion, that so no man might be taken upon the sudden, as Mr. Balye and Mr. Hodges are reported to be. To this, I must needs confess, that a long Custom, though never so bad, especially if time out of mind, should have a Warning-peal before 'its dissolution, and that no man should be struck on the sudden. My Answer therefore is, that either I did give warning at the last Act to the former worthy and careful Vicechancellour, or else very fulness of it in my thoughts thrust it out, and made me believe I had written it, if I have not. And which of these is true, my bad Memory will not ascertain me. Next therefore I think it very fit, there should be both a time prefixt, and notice given. Both which I shall thus far leave to your consideration. First then, because the Records are with you, I pray call the Heads, and view them touching this point of Cumulation. Then if you find the Wisdom of our Ancestors in former times, when Government was stricter, and Degrees not so frequent, to have allow'd them, I shall then leave you fairly to represent, what you find and think. Provided, that there be no Dispensation for any Exercise, the least, but that all be done as Statute requires. And provided likewise, that none be admitted to Cumulate upon any pretence, that are resident in the University, or that live within 30 miles, and may so come without great either trou∣ble or charge. And whatsoever you shall upon view of these Records by mutuas consent agree unto, I shall not without great reason vary from. And at this Meeting you may take it into deliberation, what is fit to be done for Mr. Balye and Mr. Hodges. For I have no will to prejudice any man upon a sudden. Neither did any man give me the least notice, that Mr. Balye liv'd at charge in town for that purpose. And for notice given, I know not what more can be done, than that Publication of it be in every College, that so they, which are abroad, may know by their Residing friends, what to trust to. GVIL. London. Right Reverend Father in God I deferr'd to answer your Lordships Letters, until Mr. Vicechancel∣lour Dr. Prideaux his Thanks, and an Answer to my former Letters. had acquainted us with your further Directions, to which it had reference. Nothing so much takes an ingenuous mind, as unde∣served Favours. For which I hold my self so obliged to your Honour, that, I trust, my future Expressions shall justisie my Thankfulness. This Bearet having occasions to see London, I thought the fittest to write
by, as being able to supply, by word of mouth, such circumstances, as I may chance to omit, and your Lordship be willing to be informed of. We are All bound to praise God, and to pray for the Continuance of Your Happiness, that so throughly set your thoughts to Reform that, which is amiss amongst us, and to recover that Lustre of the University which latter times had somewhat neglected. For Cumulations, I see not . what could be more deliberately set down, than your last Advertise∣ment. The Proceeding at nine years for Bachelours and sometimes Under-Graduates (howsoever in use heretofore by Custom and the hint of a Statute) in all reason at this time needs Reformation, especially the Case among Divines being now otherwise, than when that Indul∣gence was given. Fourteen years might well be required (as your Lordship intimates) in Supplicants of That condition. And if so they Pass, it may be held a Favour. Mr. Balye accounts himself made by your Lordship's Goodness. He hath been well chid, and acknowledg∣ed his folly to Mr. Vice-Chancellour, who, he hopes, is satisfied. That The Act Que∣stion. untoward Question the last Act was never approv'd by me, in those terms it pass'd, but I stand not to execute. Now I understand by your Loving and Fatherly Advertisement, what will be expected of me, I shall by God's Grace take a Care hereafter, that no such occa∣sion of Exception be given. Two things yet remain concerning my Place, which I make bold to tender also to your judicious consideration. The neglect of Divinity disputations for Term these five years last past, through tergiversations of the Actors. And the Proceeding of divers in Law of late, to the prejudice of Divinity. Mr. Thimble can inform you at full in both particulars. I am fearful to trespass further upon your weighty employments; But with my hearty prayer unto God for your health and happiness, rest, Exeter Coll. Octob. 25. 1630. Your Honour's most ready at Command, John Prideaux. Right Reverend Father in God, BY your last to me, and your Direction to Mr. Vice-Chancellour, Dr. Prideaux his Thanks and Acknowledge∣ment of the Justness of my Proceedings. which he lovingly imparted unto me, I have received that comfort of your undeserved respect and favour, which shall ever ty me to a thankful Acknowledgement. Yesterday Mr. Vice-Chancellour convented us concerning Term disputations. It took so well with all, that by a joint consent it was presently thought fit to second so reasona∣ble and seasonable a Proposal with immediate Execution. This was thought would make way, that when the time cometh, prefix'd by your Lordship, there would be no failing, and intimate to your favou∣rable Consideration, what concurrence there is amongst us in due Obe∣dience, where Directions are so Just, Judicious, and necessary. Con∣cernig
the late proceeding of Lawyers, we cannot desire more, than your Lordship resolves upon. In any thing, that my Assistance may be useful to Mr. Vice-Chancellour, or otherwise, I trust, my faithful endeavours shall make good, how unfeignedly I desire to shew my self, Exon. Coll. Novem. 24. 1630. Your Lordships Most ready at Command, John Prideaux. May it please your Lordship, IF it be not too boldly done of us to interrupt your Lordship's The Proctors of the Univer∣sity their Thanks con∣cerning Refor∣mation. greater Affairs, we should hope, that you would be pleas'd to ac∣cept with favour these few lines from us, which are, according to our humble Duty and Service, to congratulate your Lordship's honourable Reformation of the University, so well begun. We cannot, nor can any man else, dissemble it. The Corruption was gotten up high, and come to stand almost in praecipiti. Some medicinal hand was of neces∣sity, and that speedily to undertake the Cure. Which God (who well saw the weightiness of the work) would, should be no other than your Lordship's, though your Lordship would not. There were others more Powerful: Your Lordship would have been our Friend however. It would be envious, you were sickly, and the like. But the Infallible Eye saw you, and what it purposed to effect by you, whilst you walked thus under the Fig-trees (that we may so speak) and Covert of your excuses. Truly it was strange to see such backwardness at the Under∣taking, and yet now such Readiness and Skill in the Execution. We see it, and must with all gratefulness acknowledge, amongst your ma∣nifold and great Occasions both for Church and State, no pains spared, no opportunity omitted, either by Word or Letter, that may any way advance the business in hand. From this Zeal of your Lordship to Learning and the welfare of the University, there is no ingenious breast amongst us, but takes fire, and would be glad to be seen though amidst the dependance of so worthy an Enterprize. Our selves, in an inferi∣our Distance, are even angry with our selves, that we have not hither∣to signifi'd to your Lordship our forwardness in our Places. But now we assure your Lordship, as we have not been altogether negligent for the time past, so from henceforward to be industrious in what be∣longs to us, in taking notice of Formalities, in laying hands upon the reigns and liberty of Dispensations, and looking to the performance of other Duties. As for the point of Dispensations, and Proceeding of Ba∣chelours, which now draws on, somewhat it may seem to be out of the way of the Proctours. But it is so poor a thing to the Universal
good, that we would request your Lordship, not to entertain so much as a thought, that we make the least account of it. And since we un∣derstand your Lordship's Desire, we shall put on resolution to make stop of all manner of Dispensations (we mean for defect of time, or of that nature) and this without any mincing of the matter, or deriving the Cause or Envy farther, than our selves. Truly it would be a foul Shame for any, more for us, to be found either backward or luke∣warm to Good Order, when our Chancellour himself is seen to press so nobly for it. Besides the reward, that we may look for, that when in after-ages your Lordship's Honours shall be recorded, and this Reformation amongst the rest, I, and amongst the chiefest, (O it hath a Genius, and must live!) we also may claim to have our Names read for those, in the time and circuit of whose office so great a work was undertaken. Thus humbly craving Pardon for our boldness, we rest, Oxford. Nov. 29. 1630. At your Lordships Service To be commanded, Ralph Austen. Henry Stringer. Proctors of the University. About this time the Principality of St. Edmund's-Hall became Concerning the Principal of St. Edmund's Hall. void by the death of Dr. Rawlinson. And the Provost of Queen's College and the Fellows there made choice of Mr. Ayrie to succeed him. This Claim for the freedom of Election, and a Queen's-College Man to be elected, they had formerly made under the Chancellourship of the Lord Arch-Bishop Bancroft, who promised them very fair for the next avoydance, but prevailed with them to let his Nomination stand for Dr. Rawlinson. Now they write their Letters to me, and humbly besought me, that their Choice of Mr. Ayrie (who had been of their College) might stand. And withall they sent me up their Writings and Evidences which they had to shew, that the Right of Election of a Principal to the Hall aforesaid was in the Provost and Fellows of Queen's College, and not in the Chancellour of the University, as the rest of the Halls are. After much Debate and full Consideration taken, I writ to the Vice-Chancellour, as followeth. S. in Christo. Sir, I Have now at last with much ado got a little time to look over the To the Vice-Chancellour concerning the Choice of a Principal of St. Edmund's-Hall. Evidences which the Provost of Queen's College sent unto me concer∣ning their Right of the Choosing of the Principal of St. Edmund's-Hall. Upon view of the Deed from the University, (in which I find the Chancellour a Party) and of the other Disputes raised concerning this
business, when the Right Honourable the Earl of Dorset was Chancel∣lour, all which concluded for the Right of the College to Choose, I think their Right is unquestionable. And the rather, because I find, that the Right Honourable my late Predecessour, the Lord Steward upon view of these Writings, declared in a Letter of his, the Right to be in the College. And for that the Provost and Fellows of Queen's College have not only made this Claim to their Right of Choice, but have also from time to time made actual Choice of the several Principals succes∣sively, whensoever That Place hath been void, and have at this time made their humble suit unto me for Confirmation of their Right: I am very willing to preserve this their Right unto them: And do here∣by Pray and Require you, as my Deputy there, to give Mr. Ayrie, whom the Provost and Fellows have lately Chosen, Admission into the Principality of the said Hall, and all such Rights, as are thereunto belonging.

S. in Christo. Sir, THese are to Pray and Require you in his Majesties name, that a My Letters to the Vicechan∣cellour about the publishing of Mr. Page's Book concern∣ing Bowing at the Name of Jesus. Book lately Printed at Oxford, and made by Mr. Page of All Souls-College, be presently put to sale and published. It is, as I am inform'd, in defence of the Canon of the Church about Bowing at the name of JESUS, and modestly and well written. And his Majesty likes not, that a Book boldly and ignorantly written by Mr. Prinne against the Church, should take place, as the Churches Opinion a∣gainst her self, or as unable to be answered by the Church. If Mr. Page stick at your Commands, shew this Letter for your Warrant and his. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and shall ever rest, Fulham. June 22. Your Loving Friend, GVIL. London. The occasion of this Letter was, that Mr. Baker, Secretary to my Prede∣cessour, The occasion of the next foregoing Let∣ter. (who no doubt, was privy to the business) had written to Mr. Page touching the contrary; whose Letter here follows. Good Mr. Page, MY Lord of Canterbury is inform'd, that you are publishing a Mr. Baker's Letter to Mr. Page about the not publishing of his Book &c. In my Pre∣decessour's time. Treatise touching the Question of Bowing at the Name of JESUS, an Argument, wherein Mr. Widdowes foolishly, and Mr. Prinne scurrilously, have already, to the scandal and disquiet of the Church, exercised their Pens. His Grace hath formerly shew'd his dislike of them both, and hearing, that you take up the Bucklers in a Theme of so small necessity, and of so great heat and distemper, which will draw on new Replies, (for Prinne will not sit down, as an idle Spectatour) and beget bitterness and intestine contestations at home amongst our selves, he is much offended, that you do stickle and keep on foot such questions, which may better be spoiled and si∣lenced, than maintain'd and draw into sideings and partakings. And therefore I am wish'd to advise you to withdraw your self from these or the like domestick broils; and if your Treatise be at the Press, to give it a stop and check, and by no means to suffer the same to be divul∣ged. For if you do, notwithstanding this Admonition, proceed in the same intention of publishing it, you will repent you, and perhaps draw more on your self of trouble and discontent, than you will reap Credit or Advantage by the pursuance of so useless an Argument. If
you were out of your Cell, and saw the World abroad, you would not meddle with things of this nature, wherein the Governours and chief Pilots of the Church discern more harm and tempest to the Church, than you, that are unacquainted with Ecclesiastical Estate, and the well ordering of it, can any way by Speculation attain un∣to; no more, than a Scholar, that can read a Lecture of The∣orical Musick, is able to play on a Lute or a Viol by his Bookish Rules, and proportions of Sounds, which are there taught. I pray you to look hereunto, and say, that a Friend advised you. And put not your self on a Business, whereof you see but the Beginning. So with my Love remembred unto you, I rest, Lambeth. May. 31. 1631. Your very loving Friend Will. Baker. S. in Christo. Annus Cancel∣larii Secundus. AFter my hearty Commendations, &c. The year is now at an end Dr. (Smith con∣tinued Vice-Chancellour a Second year. of my Vice-Chancellour's Government. And when I look back upon it, I must needs acknowledge, he hath taken a great deal of pains, and shew'd himself a very discreet, able, and worthy Go∣vernour: And in all the passages of this year, I do not find, but that he hath given you all great satisfaction; especially, in his Care for Or∣der and Formalities; which, I hope, you will so far like, as that you will make it away to recover the Ancient Honour of that famous Uni∣versity in things of greater Consequence. And though the University be full of able and discreet Governours; (to whom we shall, God wil∣ling, hereafter commit this Office of Trust) yet because I have found Dr. Smith's great Care in this former year, and because the First year doth but enable his Experience the better to manage the Second; I am desirous to put him to this years pains also; And do therefore make choice of him to be my Vice-Chancellour for this year following. These are therefore to pray and require you to allow of this my Choice of Dr. Smith, and to give him the best Counsel and Assistance in all businesses, which may any way concern the Government and the Honour of that famous University. And so I bid you very heartily farewel, and rest, To my Loving Friends, the Vicechancellour, the Doctors, the Proctours, and the rest of the Convocation of the Vniversity of Oxford. Fulham. July 4. 1631. Your very loving Friend and Chancellour, GVIL. London.
S. in Christo. AFter my hearty Commendations, &c. I have made all the con∣venient My Letters sent with his Majesties to the University about Fees. July 4. 1631. speed I can, (as you well know) to have the Body of the Statutes of the University digested into Order, and made fit for present use, as occasions might be offer'd, and still heartily pray you for the quickning of that work. For by that Delay, which hath been made, a great inconvenience hath been like to arise to the prejudice of the Privileges of the University. For whereas I thought the Modera∣tion and ordering of Fees in the University, if any thing be amiss there∣in, might have staid, till that Body of Statutes had been drawn up, and then have been rectifi'd under the Head belonging to it; it seem's now far otherwise. For I find, that a Friend of the University's gave intimation to some Heads of Colleges of some things, which might be very prejudicial to your Privileges, if they did proceed. I knew his Majesty had given out a Commission to Examine Fees, and that the Commissioners were quick and strict; but I had never seen the Com∣mission; nor did I so much as dream, that the Universities were in∣cluded; or that his Majesty had any purpose, they should that way be look'd into. And therefore when Dr. Bancroft came unto me di∣rected by Mr. Vice-Chancellour and divers of the Heads of Houses upon the aforesaid information, to make search after the Commission, and privately to acquaint me with it, and to desire my Endeavour with his Majesty, that no foreign Commission might come in, to the pre∣judice of the University Privilege; I was much troubled at it. And the more, because I found, things had been so privately carry'd from the knowledge of the Chancellours of both Universities. But it fell out exceeding well, that I had notice of this business. For within few days after, my Lord of Holland, upon like Information, had speech with me about it. But his Majesties resolutions for proceeding put us both to seek what course to take, till at last we resolved to go Both together to him, and humbly to move him in the University's be∣half, that no Foreign Power might be sent to the prejudice of their Pri∣vileges. And after much Debate, his Majesty was at last very gra∣ciously pleass'd to grant our requests: Provided, that each University respectively would meet, and by themselves reform, whatsoever was found amiss in any Fees received and taken by any in the University, of what Office or Condition soever. And that this Reforma∣tion of Fees should be made according to the Letter and Tenour of his Commission. Hereupon he presently called for Mr. Secretary Cook, and commanded him to direct a Letter to the Chancellours of both the Universities, to give them Order for this business. Which Let∣ters of his Majesty you shall find here inclosed: And the like are alrea∣dy His Majesties Letters to be Register'd gone to Cambridge. And I must, and do pray and require you, that they be published according to Course, and Register'd, and Obey'd in all Points, as is fitting: Assuring you, that if this be not done, his Majesties Commissioners will reform whatsoever you do not. And
And for my part, I think 'tis happy we came so timely to the know∣ledg of it. For if the Commissioners had once entred upon it, it would have been a matter of far greater difficulty to take them off, than it was now to stay them. And certainly, if ever it be my hap to know That honourable Personage, that gave the first Information I shall give him hearty Thanks for his Love to the Universities. For this breach once made upon your Privileges might have laid open a wider gap in many other particulars of like nature. When you have Register'd these Letters of his Majesty, I must pray you to send the Original back to me. And for the Business it self, because his Majesty look's for a speedy reformation, the best Counsel I can give you is this: That the Delegates, which have the considera∣tion The Delegates to settle present∣ly the Business of Fees. of the Statutes now before them, may, by your direction and command, take the Head about Fees next into Consideration, and settle that business presently, that the other University may not out∣strip us in Obedience to his Majesty. Thus not doubting of your Care herein, nor of the University's con∣formity; and expecting as present remedy of this Abuse, as may be made, I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest, To my Loving Friends, the Vice-Chancellour, the Doctors, the Proctours, and the rest of the Convocation of the University of OXFORD. Fulham July 4. 1631. Your Loving Friend, and Chancellour, GVIL. London. The Tenor of the King's Letters Follow's, CHARLES R. RIGHT trusty, and Right well beloved Cousin and Counsellour, His Majesties Letters to me about the  of the . and Right Reverend Father in God, Right trusty and well∣beloved
Counsellour, We greet you well. We have long had a gracious Intendment for the good of our Subjects to rectifie the Proceedings of all Courts and other Places, as well within Liberties as without, in matter of their Fees and Duties which they Challenge. To this purpose We have granted a Commission to some Lords of our Privy Council and others, to Examine what they find amiss, that a remedy may be found for the Abuse, where and in whomsoever it is, and the Fees of all Officers, and Courts reduced to that which they were found to be allow'd in the Eleventh year of Queen Elizabeth of famous memory: And this Com∣mission we shall pursue, till we have setled those things with Honour and Justice to the great ease of all our Loving Subjects. Now whereas you, taking notice of this our Intendment to reduce the Fees of both our Universities, (where you are our Chancellours) as well as other pla∣ces to the same Standard, have made humble suit to Us, that this Com∣mission may not trench upon the Liberties granted to the Universities by our Royal Progenitors: These are first to let you know, that We will as carefully preserve the Rights and Privileges of our Vniversi∣ties, as We or our Progenitors have given or confirmed them: And then, that our further VVill and Pleasure is, that presently (to pre∣vent our Commission) you write expresly to your Deputy-Governours in either University, to VVill and Require them in Our Name, to recti∣fie and reduce all Fees given to Officers, Readers, Bedels, Registers, or others, for Degrees, or any thing else, to That quantity which they bore in the said Eleventh year of Queen Elizabeth. For the Abuse is great and burdensome unto them, which bring up their Sons in Learning: And We will remedy it by Our Commission, if you (according to your Places) do not see it remedy'd to our hands. And We are the more Careful for Our Universities; Because we have not forgotten, that Our Royal Father of ever blessed Memory gave Bountiful Gifts to supply divers wants There, which We assure Our self were not given, but with an intent, that when they were possessed, the Fees should lessen, at least return to that just proportion, to which we have limited them in our Commission. So We grant your Suit, not to break the Liberties of our Universities, by sending another Power upon them: But withal, We require you both, to send to our several Universities rsepectively, that VVe may have present Redress of this Abuse; and that a Table may be made according to the elevene th of Queen Elizabeth, and hung up in the Congregation, and in some convenient place in every College and Hall, that every man may know, what Fees he is to pay, and no man presume to take beyond the Al∣lowance in that Table, as he will answer it at his Peril: And we shall look
for an Accompt of this from you both respectively. Given under our Signet at To Our Right trusty and Right Wellbeloved Cousin and Counsellour, Henry Earl of Holland, Chancellour of Our University of Cambridg: And to the Right Reverend Father in God, Our Right Trusty and Welbeloved Counsellour, VVilliam Lord Bishop of London, Chancellour of our Uni∣versity of OXFORD.

Non sinis imponi nobis vim necessitatis, vel in iis etiam, quae ad nostrum spectant emolumentum: Sed aequè sanandi modo ac ipsi consulens sanitati, aut ea imperas, quae sponte volumus, aut prius velle fias ea, quae imperas: Ac tum demum, ubi voti ardor incaluit eundem Obsequii studio ingeminatum accendis, non segniùs, quam ventus secundo flamine proni impellit cursum fluenti. Liberalium amici Artium sub Feodorum onere, & graduum venalium caritate jam diu suspirarunt, diu tacuerunt.

Honori vestro devinctissima, Oxonien. Academia. July 26 1631. The first Stone of my Building at St. John Baptist's College was laid. NOW that this intended Good may come the fuller upon the My Building at S. John's University, a great help must come from you and your Successors, from time to time in That Office. And first, while the awe of this is upon them, you must call for the present performance of those things, which his Majesty enjoyned; especially, the present drawing A  of my Letters to the Vice-chancellour concerning Boots, Taverns, and the Kings Decla∣ration, &c. Sept. 23. 1631. This Letter was here placed out of order, to the end there might come nothing be∣tween the great Business which follows. up of the Statutes concerning Appeals, and of the standing Delegacy of the Heads of Colledges and Halls, to meet every week or every fort∣night at least, as well in Vacation as Term, both to consider of the present businesses of the University, and to prepare such things, as are fit for Convocation. Which Statutes of this Delegacy, and the Appeals were they once settled, would ease half of the business of the University, and repay all the pains that is or can be taken about them. Next, I pray call the Heads together, and give them warning concerning their several Companies, That no man of what degree soever (and therefore much less Youths) be suffered to go in Boots and Spurs together with their Gowns. And if any Head of a House permit it in his own College, whither my Authority reaches not, I shall complain where he will be unwilling to Answer. And for your self I pray and require you, that if any man be seen abroad with them in Town out of his College, you presently proceed against him according to such , as you have De  Scholastico, &c. And the like for haunting of Inns or Taverns, or other Drinking-Houses,  Masters of Arts, that should give younger Youths better ex∣ample. And that all Bachelours of Arts, as well  as o∣thers, Bachelors of  to uncover their heads when they meet their Supe∣riours in Degree or be in presence with them. receive a strict command by their several Governours, that while  any  they pass along the  or any publick place, they uncover their heads and do that reverence which beseems them, to any Doctor, Bachelour of Divinity, Master of Arts, or Bachelour of Law or , whom they shall meet or be in presence with. And that you proceed to the punishment of all such as fail in this kind. And  I pray acquaint Dr. Prideaux and Dr. , that I will look they shall read their several Lectures as the Statutes require. And if Dr. Prideaux and Dr. Fell to read their Le∣ctures accord∣ing to the Sta∣tutes. The keeping of his Majestys De∣claration urged: And to punish Offenders a∣gainst it. they read treatably, that their younger Auditors may observe by writ∣ing (if they please) one Lecture may be broken into many, to their own great , and the greater profit of them that hear them, and a Face of the University be kept in that particular. And last of all, these are strictly to require you, that since his Majesty hath so lately and fully ex∣prest himself for the keeping of his Declaration in all points, that you shew your self very careful in that particular, and that you proceed im∣partially against Delinquents any way, that neither one nor the
other may have cause to say, that you favour a Party. And you have great reason to be watchful in this, because you know it was objected against you at Woodstock in Dr. Potter's Case: which though it appeared palpa∣bly false, yet it may and ought to be a Summons to you to look warily to your self. And some eye it is fit you should bear towards me even in this particular, that my Government be not slandered by it. Septem. 23. 1631. GVIL. London. In this year there arose a great stir in the University by some factious The trouble∣some  ari∣sing in the  a∣gainst Govern∣ment. men, which laboured to disturb the Government both in their Ser∣mons and in Convocation, and by secret Plotings. Their profest aim was, to dissolve the Delegacy appointed for the ordering and settling of the Statutes, and to set the Proctours, in as cunning a way as they could, against the Chancellor, till they had almost brought all Disorder into the U niversity. How far they proceeded, and what issue their plots had, will appear in the Acts following. The Head of all these Tumultuous stirs was by violent presumptions conceived to be one whom it least became for his Coat-sake: And I shall spare his name, ra∣ther for his Coat than himself. Right Reverend, My Honourable Good Lord, I Have not hitherto troubled your Lordship with Letters of Informa∣tion Dr. Duppa's Letters to me concerning the late Disorders in Oxford. concerning any of our University-affairs, knowing into what sufficient hands you have committed the trust of them, from whence I imagine you receive a weekly account. But such hath been the height of our late Disorders both without and within the Pulpit, that should I not some way express, that I am troubled with it, I might be thought a very insensible Member of this Body, which you govern. For these late stirs are not of an Ordinary nature; but strike at the very Root of Government, which now lies bleeding. The Vicechancellor's d power is Questioned: The Proctours, that should assist him, receive the Appeals of Delinquents from him: The Delegates such, as are rather Parties than Judges. And I could wish this were all. But this Gangrene will spread farther. For the University by these means is likely to become the Seed-plot of Mutiners, to  both Church and Common-wealth with. But my comfort is, that the way of their own Choosing, the way of Appeal, (which it may be at first they did not think of) must at last end before his Sacred Majesty: For there is nothing left but the Voice of such a Power to allay this Storm. The whole University, though with several affections, stands now at Gaze: And the end of this Busi∣ness must either prove an awful peace, or the letting loose of all Confusion. My Duty to my King, my Love to Peace, and my respect to your Lordship hath commanded this Letter from me; which if you please to pardon, you will tread in the steps of your former goodness, and o∣blige
me to the continuance of my prayers for you, whom you shall ever find Ch. Ch. Aug. 1. 1631. Your Lordships most humble and true servant Brian Duppa. To the King's Most Excellent Majesty. The humble Petition of WILLIAM SMITH, Dr. of Divinity, and Vicechancellor of the Vniver∣sity of OXFORD. WHereas of late the Peace of your Majesties University of Oxford hath been much disturbed through the Sedicious practices of Dr. Smith, Vicechancellor, his Petition to the King against Ford's Sermon. some distemper'd Spirits, who have not only in their Sermons presum'd to handle divers points of Doctrin prohibited by your Majesties strait Command; but also by some not obscure passages have endeavoured to fasten the imputation of Apostacy and Back-sliding upon some Per∣sons of Eminent quality there and elsewhere: And whereas one Tho∣mas Foord, having in a late Sermon of his at S. Maries offended in that kind, was thereupon by your humble Petitioner (according to the Sta∣tutes of the University) convented, and required to exhibit a Copy of his Sermon: And upon his Refusal so to do, was therefore commanded to Prison: He likewise contrary to his Oath disobeying that command also: And Appealing from your Petitioner to the Congregation-house (which by the Statutes of the University, in that case of breach of Peace, he might not do): The Proctors notwithstanding (which should have assisted your Petitioner) received the Appeal, and the major part of the Delegates entertained it (to the wrong both of your humble Pe∣titioner and the Government of the University) and quitted the said Foord, as not guilty of the Perturbation of the Peace. And whereas up∣on this Sentence of theirs, your humble Petitioner finding himself ag∣grieved, appealed to the House of Convocation, through default of Appearance of a major part of Delegates appointed thereunto, your hum∣ble Petitioners Cause (being there deserted and let fall) is at lengh accord∣ing to the Statutes of the University, devolved into your sacred Maje∣sties hands: And whereas one Giles Thorne, by a scandalous Sermon of his lately preached in the same Place, hath likewise farther disturbed the Peace of the University, and more are like to follow (especially not wanting Abettors to give them encouragement) unless some speedy course be taken for prevention. The humble suit therefore of your Majesties poor Petitioner is, that out of your special Clemency always plentifully extended towards the
Church, and her Seminaries, your Majesty would be graciously pleased to take into your own Royal Consideration, the preservation of the Peace and Tranquillity of your University, and of the Autho∣rity of her Governours against the Practices of such, as under the co∣lour of Religion or Liberty oppugn both Church and Civil Govern∣ment: That so these Troubles of the University may have a present end by your Majesty's happy Coming so near it. And your humble Petitioner shall pray, &c. IN Dei nomine, Amen.

Humfridus Jones, Notarius Publicus. Upon this Petition and Appeal, his Majesty coming that year in The great Hear∣ing at Wood∣stock. progress to Woodstock, he resolved to hear the Cause Himself, and put an end to those Factious and Disorderly courses, which were grown too heady for any other Hand. And upon , Aug. 23. his Majesty, in the presence of all the Lords of his Counsel, which were with him (divers Heads of Colleges being also present) heard at large all Complaints and Grievances on either side: And concluded,
That both the Proctours should in the next Convocation resign their Offices, and Two other of the same Colleges be put in their Places: And that Thomas Ford of Magdalen-hall, Giles Thorne of Baliol College, and John Hodges of Exeter College, should be banish'd the University: And that Doctor Prideaux, Rector of Exeter College, and Dr. Wilkin∣son, Principal of Magdalen, should then and there receive, in the pre∣sence of the King and the Lords, a publick and sharp Reprehension for their misgovernment and countenancing the Factious Parties. The Lord Viscount Dorchester, then Principal Secretary of State, was com∣manded to deliver this Sentence from the King, which he did accor∣dingly, and gave the Reprehension as was enjoyned: The King him∣self then publickly Declaring, that Dr. Prideanx deserved to lose his Place more than any of the rest, but was content to spare him, partly because he had been His ancient Servant, and hoped he would look better to himself for the future, and partly because I intreated Favour for him. As for Francis Hide, who had been Proctor the former year, and was as mutinous as any of the rest, he was out of the University when the Summons came for their Appearance before the King, and so kept himself till the Hearing was past: Yet nevertheless so much appeared against him, as that afterwards he was glad to come in, and make his submission, that he might escape so. Then his Ma∣jesty commanded Secretary Dorchester to write a Letter for Him to Sign, and to be sent to the University, and in Convocation to require the performance of this Sentence in every particular. This Letter was written and sent accordingly; and the Tenor of it follows in haec verba. At WOODSTOCK, Aug. 23. 1631. CHARLES, R. TRusty and wellbeloved, We greet you well. Having at full His Majesties Letter sent to the University after the great Hearing at Woodstock, Aug. 24. 1631. length, and with good Deliberation, heard the Cause concer∣ning the late great Disorders and Disobedience to Government in That Our University of Oxford, and being moved by the greatness of the offences to Punish some persons according to their several Demerits, and to Order some things for the more settled and constant Government of That our University hereafter: Our Will and Pleasure is, That you forthwith upon the receipt hereof, call a Convocation for performing and registring these Our Sentences and Decrees, as followeth. And first, We pronounce your Appeal to be just, And return Tho. Forde, Thorne and Hodges ba∣nish'd the . Forde of Magdelane Hall, Giles Thorne of Baliol College, and William Hodges of Exeter College (whose Causes were likewise submitted unto Us) unto your power, And command you that forthwith they be all three Banish'd the University, according as your Statutes in that behalf require.
Secondly, Because the Proctours, which should have been Assistants The Proctours Bruche and Doughty to re∣sign their Of∣fice. to the Vicechancellour, and Helps for upholding of Authority and Go∣vernment, have most unworthily behaved themselves in countenancing all manner of Disobedience, in receiving Appeals in case of manifest perturbation and breach of Peace, and by their cunning practicing after these Appeals received, especially Thorne's, whose Contumacy was no∣torious, and his Sermon base: Therefore for them, Our Pleasure and Command is, as was yesterday delivered unto themselves, that they shall presently resign their Office in Convocation according to Course, as if their year had been fully expired, and the two Colleges, of which they are, may name two others to succeed in their Office the rest of the year, to be chosen and settled according to your late Statutes made in that behalf. And for the Execution of this, you are (as we have before order'd) presently to call a Convocation, and publish this Our Sentence, and pro∣ceed accordingly. Thirdly, For Francis Hyde of Christchureh, and Richard Hill of Brazen Nose, we require, that so soon as they return to Our Uni∣versity, Hyde and Hill to be warned at their Return to be in a rea∣diness to an∣swer to their several Charges you warn them to be in a readiness, and give notice to your Chancellour, when they are there, that they may be sent for to Answer such things as are laid against them: And when they are heard, they shall receive such Sentence, as the merits of their Cause deserve. Now for the things which we think fit to settle presently in That Government, they are these. First, VVe Command, that if the Vicechancellour for the time being Every man to give in a true Copy of his Sermon at the Demand of the Vicechancel∣lor and that u∣pon Oath. think fit to call for any Man's Sermon, which upon his own hearing, or complaint made by any other, seems offensive in any kind, the Party of what Degree soever he be, shall deliver a true and perfect Co∣py to the Vicechancellour upon Oath, which when he hath perused, he shall Convent him, if he find cause, either by the Statute of Le cester, (as it is call'd) or by the later Statute of the  Doctors, at the Vice∣chancellours choice, until at this New settling of your Statutes one entire and absolute Statute be made of Both. Secondly, That if the Vicechancellour find cause to Command any man Any man com∣manded to Prison by the Vicechancel∣lour, to submit to Prison, the Party so Commanded and sent by a Beadle, shall (for so the Statutes require) presently submit, and go quietly to Prison: And if they do not, That Refusal shall be as a Breach of the Peace, and not have any Appeal
Thirdly, We Command, that the Delegates, which at this present The Delegates commanded to draw up the first two Sta∣tutes concer∣ning Appeals before they Proceed. are in hand with the Statutes, make all the speed that possibly they can, for the finishing of that Great and Excellent Work; yet so as that present∣ly they lay all other Statutes aside, till they have drawn up two Perfect and sufficient Statutes for Causes of Appeal, the one in matters of Instance, and those things, that belong to the Chancellour's Court There; the other for all kind of Appeals in other Causes whatsoever; and that they keep as near to the ancient Statutes of our University as possibly they can, so as they may also meet with all the present Inconveniences. And likewise that they presently draw up the form of A weekly Meeting every Monday of the Heads of Col∣leges and Halls. another Statute for the weekly Meeting every Monday in Term and out of Term of all the Heads of Colleges and Halls, that shall be in Town, to consider of the Peace and Government of our University, as occasion, may arise: That so all things may be deliberately put (when there is Cause) to the Convocation according to such Directions, as we shall give to your Chancellour, from whom you shall receive them. And these Our Letters shall be your sufficient Warrant on this behalf. Given under Our Signet, at Our Honour of Woodstock the 24th day of August in the seventh year of Our Reign. 1631.

In this year was the Chappel at Queen's=College Wainscotted. Right Reverend, my most Honoured good Lord, HOW much I am bound to thank my good God, who in the midst of Mr. Hill's Let∣ter to me, how he was mislead by Dr. Pride∣aux in this bu∣siness. trouble hath so much blessed me with your Lordship's grace and favour to rowl my self upon. In confidence, that through these Clouds by your Lordship's goodness and mediation the Royal favour of my
most gracious and blessed Sovereign will shine upon me. Nemo pro∣ficiens erubescit, saith Tertul. No man is ashamed to relate the story of his offence, when he is come to himself, and begins to thrive in the way of a better opinion and judgment. It hath been my great grief and misery, but to be thought to be possessed with that damned Spirit of opposition, which in Publick exercise I have cryed down and con∣jured, or to give fire to any factious Spirit to rebel against Authority and the breath of Heaven. Omnis sermo ad forensem famam à domesticis emanat authoribus, saith the Orator. I know no malice can truly pre∣vent the Credit of my words. I thank my God, I have been often an occasion of Peace, and quietness within my College; Never was before engaged in any such mad affront, for which I shall ever condemn my self upon the Theater of my own Conscience, and suspect my Leaders. How easy a thing is it for some men in some eminent and leading places to give occasion to quiet and temperate Spirits to Rebel against their own Conscience and ingenuity! Therefore (saith St. Austin) might the Example of Cato have prevail∣ed much, when he slew himself, Non quia solus id fecerat, not because he alone had done so, Sed quia vir doctus & probus habebatur, but be∣cause he was esteemed to be a learned and an honest Man. Two glorious Titles, which touch and confine the hearts and affections of all good men, if they sometimes prove not false fires, to delude the World and cheat the weaker in their opinions. I must not much trespass upon your Lordship's many serious and weighty affairs. How glad∣ly would I enlarge and unbowel my self in any Style of true and hearty submission! Mihi fama posthac vilius constabit. So beseeching the continuance of your Lordship's favourable respect, and good opini∣on of me, I shall be ever bound to pray for your Lordship's prosperity and happiness. From Brazen-Nose Coll. in Oxon. Octob. 23. 1631. Your Lordship's most humble and devoted Servant, Rich. Hill. Right Reverend, and Right Honourable, IT hath added some degrees more to my Sorrows, that I have not Another Letter of Mr. Hill's to me about Dr. Prideaux. given your Lordship better satisfaction. As my Tongue hath been the true and even Pulse of my Heart, so my desire is my Pen should be the true and plain expression. True it is, that the Example of Dr. Prideaux, my Father (whom with Reverence I am to name) too much ruled within my breast. For I could not in any Charity believe, that he, who had been so often Vice-Chancellour, would any way seem to betray or mino∣rate the Authority and Power of that place. Besides (that every man may rather bear his own burthen) I confess that my own fancy doted
so much upon that late 8th Edict, mistaking it both in its end and la∣titude. For it is impossible that any one Decree can in it self be so round and full; as to meet so closely with all manner of Offenders in all circumstances and several Degrees of offences: much less seem any way to confine and bind the hands of authority from punishing accor∣ding to discretion, even by virtue also of that general statute of obedi∣ence, which sweetly runs through all, and indeed is the golden Chain or main tye and link of all. By this, may it please your good Lordship, there was no malice here, but Error, and such an Error, that begot both in my self and others a strange mad stupidity, that one among ten could not be able, or so happy upon the suddain to look up to that power which is the rule and perfection, the life and Crown of all. I beseech your Lord∣ship to set a period to these (amidst many other) the troubles of From Brazen Nose Coll. Oxon. Nov. 7th. 1631. Your Lordship's ever truly devoted Servant, Rich: Hill. Right Worthy Sir, YOU cannot but know, (tho' I think you have almost forgotten) Mr. Loyde's Letter to the Vice-Chancel lour. what high displeasure I am sallen into by my unfortunate atten∣dance and behaviour in a Del gacy. Had my intentions been really, as foul, as information hath derived them to be, I should not now dare to entreat your pardon. I had not lately durst so near to have approached unto so great Integrity, as to wait upon your most Hono∣rable Chancellour. His Lordship was pleased to vouchsafe me access; was pleased to acquaint me with the charge of my guilt. To whom when my eadeavoured excuses (for defence I thought not of) could not yeild satisfaction, His Lordship (as enclined to shew me favour) commanded me to signifie thus much to you, as also to intimate, that he did expect to hear from you, what satisfaction you should conceive fit to be given by me for so publick an Injury. Sir, you best know my offence, and so what punishment it merits, as also (which is my com∣fort) what kind best sorts with ingenuity. In what Condition I now stand, I am severely sensible; how to better it, I know not, Unless you shall vouchsafe by remitting those errours, which weakness of judgment (not strength of Faction or disaffection to Authority) engaged me in, to make me capable of favour. I humbly crave your pardon for so long interrupting your more serious employments, and shall wait for and submit unto whatsoever you shall be pleased to determine of, London, Nov. 13. 1631. Your Humble Servant, Francis Hyde,

Flexis ita{que} genibus, & animo officiosè devoto praedictus Mr. Hodges Sequentia legebat in scriptis manu suâ pro∣priâ consignata. Quorum tenor sequitur, & est talis. I William Hodges do freely and sincerely acknowledge before this Mr. Hodges his submission De∣cemb. 15. 1631. in Convocation. venerable Assembly of Convocation, that in a Sermon by me preach't in St Maries upon the 26th of June last past, I fell upon the delivery of those points, which by his Majesties Royal Injunctions were forbidden me to meddle withal, and therein I confess with hearty sorrow my great disobedience against his Sacred Majesty. Moreover I do likewise with hearty sorrow confess, that I did let fall some passages, that might be taken to the disparagement of the Government of the Church, in making erroneous and heretical opinions the way to preferment. All which, with the main current of my discourse might sound to sedition in the Ears of the present assembly: By this my great and inexcusable offence, I do freely acknowledge, that I have deserved the sharpest of Censures and severest of punishments; and therefore that his Royal Majesty hath justly rewarded me for the same, it being an offence of so high a nature. And I have nothing at all to plead, but the Royal Mercy of my gracious Sovereign for my restitution to this famous University. This my Confession and Submission I do most humbly tender to the favourable acceptance of this Venerable House, craving the Pardon of the University in general, so more especially, of
our most Honorable Chancellour, whom with all humility I beseech to present this my acknowledgement to his Majesties Sacred hand, as the pledge and ingagement both in present and for the future of my readiest obedience. William Hodges. I Thomas Hill, do freely and sincerely acknowledge before this Vene∣rable Mr. Hill's sub∣mission, Decem. 15. 1631. in Convocation. Assembly of Convocation, that in a Sermon lately by me preach't in St. Maries, I did let fall divers scandalous Speeches, partly in opposition to His Majesties Injunctions, by odious Justling toge∣ther the names of certain Factions in the Church, and imputing Pela∣gianisme and Popery to the one side: Partly in disparagement of the present Government of State and Church, by making foul and erro∣neous Opinions the readiest steps now-a-days to Preferment. As also in disparaging the whole Order of Bishops in point of Learning and Religion, making them favourers of unsound and erroneous Do∣ctrine, and disfavourers of sound Doctrine. As likewise in imputing to a great part of our Clergy only Politique and Lunatick Religi∣on: Besides private glances against particular Persons concerning some Speeches delivered in their late Sermons, in all which passages in my Sermon, I confess to have given just offence to the University, and to deserve the sharpest of Censures. Wherefore with all humble sub∣mission I beseech the whole University, represented in this Venerable House, to pass-by this my willful errour of undiscrect and misguided Zeal, and do faithfully promise henceforward to abstain from all such scandalous aspersions and intimations, as tending only to the disparage∣ment of the Church, and the Distraction and disquiet of the Univer∣sity. And this my Submission I humbly crave may be accepted, which I do here make willingly, and from my heart, with true sorrow for what is past. Thomas Hill. VVHEREAS, Upon Information given to his Majesty con∣cerning Mr.  submission. Misdemeanours of the Delegates in hearing and determining the Cause of Appeal, set on foot by Mr. Forde against Mr. Vice-Chancellour, his Majesty was pleased to give Order, that as soon as I came unto the University, notice should be given unto the Right Honourable and Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bp. of London, our Chancellour, that upon Examination of the business I might receive such Censure, as the merits of the Cause should deserve, and his Lordship upon my voluntary appearance, acknowledgement of my Errours, and humble submission to his Lordship, has been pleased to remit me back to the University, and hath ordered, that in the presence of Mr. Vice-Chancellour, and the Governours of Colleges and Halls, I should make the like Recognition of my Errors and offensive Carriage in that business. I with all humility and thankfulness acknowledge his Lordship's favour, and do freely and ingenuously confess, that in the
hearing of that Cause, I did declare my self in the maintenance of Mr. Ford's appeal with more Vehemency, than did become an indifferent man, not without disrespect to Mr Vice-Vhancellour, and some other Misdemeanours. For which inconsiderate Carriage I am very heartily sorry, and do humbly crave pardon of Mr. Vice-Chancellour and the University, and do seriously promise, that from henceforth I will avoid all partakings or factious endeavours against the quiet and Go∣vernment of the University, and as much as shall be in my power, will be assisting to the orderly proceedings of those, who are in autho∣rity, and set over me in this place, Francis Hyde. Right Honourable, and Right Reverend Father in God, VVIth all Humility let me beseech your Lordship amongst other Mr. Hodges his Letters os Thanks. faults of mine, to pardon this one of Presumption. And having sealed me a pardon for my boldness, I must again beseech your Honourable favour to entertain this the necessary Testimony and ten∣der of my heartiest thanks and most humble Service. Let all the World forget me, when I forget to be grateful, having been bless'd with as great a favour from your fatherly hands, as I could in reason or modestly sue for. The re enlivening of dying hopes, the seasonable re∣freshing of a whithering branch, the happy recovery of a man as low in present being of his decayed fortunes, as punishment and desert could set him; the work your Lordships, mine the benefit; my ex∣pressions may come below the greatness both of the Benefit I enjoy, and of the Favour I have received; but my Prayers and continual Devotions shall not. I shall make up in these the defects of the former, and in these I shall pray God to bless me so through the course of my Studies and Endcavours, as that I may be able to approve my self, From Exon. Coll. in Oxon. Febr. 22. Your Lordships in all thankfulness and faithful Service to be commanded, VVilliam Hodges. S. in Christo. AFter my hearty Commendations, &c. I am very sorry, that I have My Letters to the Convoca∣tion about the disorders in the Schools the last Lent. this Occasion to write to the University, which I love so well, that it cannot but trouble me to hear of any thing ill done in it. I have divers ways heard, what disorders and tumults have accompa∣nied the publick Disputations toward the end of the last Lent, to the
great scandal of the University, and tending to the breach of all Go∣vernment there. The noise of these great Disorders was like enough of it self to be heard far, and to add to this Unhappiness, these Misde∣meanours were then committed, when they might be seen by some, which meant not to conceal them. Insomuch that the report of them is come to his Majesties Ears, who is highly displeased with this ill carriage, and the more, because he thought the care and the pains, which he lately took to settle some breaches of Government there, would not so soon have been forgotten, as it seems to him they are. Upon this his Ma∣jesty hath directed his Princely Letters to me, and by them required me to look both to the punishment of these Distempers and the preventing of the like hereafter. According to these his Majesties Royal Com∣mands I do pray and require you, Mr. Vice-Chancellour, and the rest of the Governours to look carefully to your several Charges, both pub∣lick and private, not only for the Honour of the University, (which it seems by some is too much neglected) but also because I find his Ma∣jesty so resolved, that he will have a severe Course held against any Governours, as well as others, that shall be proved faulty. And that this may appear, I have sent you here his Majestie's Letters to me, which are to be read in open Convocation, that the whole University may know, how distasteful these Courses are to his Majesty, and how prejudicial they may be to your selves. And I do heartily pray you all, that hereafter, not only in Disputations, but upon all other Occurrences whatsoever, you uphold the Honour and Government of that Place, and spare no man, that shall be proved an Offender against either. And for my part, if nothing else will serve, I shall take the best course I can to see Justice done, and Example made, where there is cause; Neither can I go off from this opinion, That the younger sort would easily be reduced into better order, if all the Governours did that, which in Conscience and Duty they are bound unto. And I will hope, that all, whom this may any ways concern, will hereafter be careful of the good of the University, the honour of themselves, and their Credit with his Majesty, which certainly can neither be gained nor held by such breaches upon Government. So praying you to take care of these things, I leave you to Gods gracious protection, and shall ever rest, To my very Loving Friends, the Vice-Chancel∣lour, the Doctors, the Proctours, and the rest of the Convocation of the University of OXFORD.

The Tenor of the King's Letters to me here Follow's, CHARLES R. RIght trusty and well beloved Counsellour, and Right Reverend His Majestie's Letters to me about the Tu∣mults in Lent Disputations. Father in God, We greet you well. We had reason to expect, that our own Princely care and former admonitions had sufficiently re∣gulated that our Vniversity of Oxford, whereof you, as Our Chan∣cellour, have the Charge. Nevertheless We understand, that the late Lent Exercises in their Schooles have been carried in such disorder, that if at the instance of the Dean of Christ-Church, the Vice-Chan∣cellour had not excused the Bachellours of that House from answering in their turn, there had followed much mischeif, which Discretion of theirs we well approve. For tho' a Vertuous Emulation to whet the Industry of Scholars be not to be discouraged, yet it must always be governed, so as it may not proceed to Animosities and factious Contestat ions of young and hot heads, which will breed Combustion and publick distur∣bance in the end, if due prevention be not used. We therefore require you, not only to give present Order for suppression of these or the like Tu∣mults; but also to see, that the Authors be punished according to their deserts. And if upon due examination you find, that any Master of a College, or other Superiour, hath been Actor or Encourager herein, or hath not done his Duty in containing the Scholars from these Distempers. Let him know, that We shall hold him unworthy of that Trust, and will not spare to punish him as We shall see cause. Given at Our Palace at VVestminster this 12. day of April 1632. in the eighth year of Our Reign. To the Right Reverend Father in God, Our Right Trusty and Well-belo∣ved Counsellour William Lord Bi∣shop of London, Chancellour of Our University of OXFORD.

AFter my hearty Commendations &c. The time is now come Dr. Duppa Dean of Christ-Church chosen Vice-Chancellour. for the choice of a new Vice-Chancellour, for I have been bold to lay the pains of that place upon Dr. Smith these two years together. In the whole course of that his Government, he hath carried himself with a great deal of fidelity to the University, and a great deal of care and moderation in the managing of so many troublesome businesses, as have fallen in his time; yet notwithstanding these and his other abi∣lities for the discharge of that place, I am resolved to name another to you: both because among so many worthy and able men, as are with you, I would not pass by all the rest continually to overload any one. And because I am very desirous to divide the Experience, as well as the pains of that service among the Heads of Colleges, to the end there may still be some, that may be acquainted with the Burthen and weight of that Office, and able the better to assist such, as must newly enter upon it. At this time upon very due Consideration I have thought fit to name Dr. Duppa, Dean of Christ-Church, to be Vice-Chancellour for this year ensuing, whom I know to be a discreet, able, and worthy man for that place, and one, that will satisfie my Expecta∣tion and yours. These are therefore to pray and require you to allow of this my Nomination and Choice of Dr. Duppa, and to give him your best advice and assistance in all such Businesses, as may concern the good Government, and consequently the Honour of the University. So I bid you all heartily farewel, and rest, To my very loving Friends, the Do∣ctours, the Proctours, and the rest of the Convocation of the University of OXFORD. Fulham-House July 11.1632.

QVum Serenissimae Regiae Majestati visum fuerit publico Edicto An Order conceived in Oxford touch∣ing the Kings Declaration a∣bout the five Articles Feb. 9. 1631/2. cavere, ne quis in religionis materiâ quicquam contra literalem Articulorum sensum pro Concione & publicè definire audeat, Existant tamen nonnulli, qui, us{que} quo hoc Edictum extendi debeat, aut pro incomperto habeant, aut se ita habere simulent: Idcirco nos (quibus obedientiae praestan∣dae publicaeque pacis conservandae & demandatur Munus, & incumbit cura, quorum etiam plenis{que} Serenissimae Regiae Majestatis tum actis tum de hâc re consiliis Woodstochiae interesse concessum est) tam crassae & supinae igno∣rantiae
ansam praescindere volentes, sic pronunciamus: Quod, ut dissidiorum flam∣mam (circa quin{que} Articulos, quos vocant, inter Remonstrantes & contra Remon∣strantes contraversos) in exteris Regionibus accensam, & vicinit ate quadam ma∣li nostros etiam Penates jamjam corripientem, huic Edicto sanciendo occasionem praebuisse optimè perspectum habemus, ita tanquam praesentissimum Remedium huic incendio restringuendo, & ad contraversias praecipuè circa hos Articu∣los exortas, hoc Edictum extendendum esse judicamus: Quicun{que} igitur in his controversiis pro sententiâ suâ tuendâ publicè de industriâ tractet, teme∣rè affirmet, aut pertinaciter definiat; Quicun{que} etiam publicè & pro Conci∣one adversam opinioni suae sententiam Argumentis, & Consequentiis odiosè proscindat, aut in adversas sententias tuentium Nomina, aut famam con∣vitiis, calumniis, aut aliis quovismodo grassetur, eundem illum, tanquam violati Regii Edicti, Pacis{que} Publicae turbatae reum postulandum censemus.

SIR YOU have done very well in Hobbes's Business; and the motion A passage of my Letters touch∣ing the Order the Heads had conceived a∣bout the Five Articles. made by Dr. Pink to prevent pleading of ignorance, &c. was in it self very good and seasonable; and you did as fitly lay hold of it, and draw up the Order about it, as I see by the inclosed; yet never∣theless there is somewhat very considerable before you publish that Order: As first, that there are certain Incidents to some of those Five Articles, which all Men upon the hearing presume forbidden; Where∣as by this Order they will take themselves confined to the five express Articles only: And secondly it must be very well weighed, what pow∣er You or I have to interpret or make an Order upon a Declaration, set forth by the Authority of the King with the consent of his Bi∣shops; and I much doubt, it will not be warrantable. In the mean time it will be enough against the Plea of ignorance to declare upon all occasions the Five Articles controverted by the Remonstrants, are the Doctrines, for a time not to be meddled with, that the Factions, un∣happily spread amongst our Neighbours may not infect this our Church, or break the Peace of it. There is somewhat else considerable also, which I think not very fit to write. But to this, if you have any ex∣ception, you may return me what Answer you please. Feb. 15. GVIL. London.
S. in Christo. AFter my hearty Commendations, &c. Upon occasion of difference My Letters to the Convocati∣on about the Patent for Printing. between Lichfeild and Turner about their Printing, there was cause given me to look into your Charters, what power the Univer∣sity had for Printing, and how many Printers were allow'd unto you. Upon search I cannot find any Grant at all, so that Custom is the best Warrant you have for that Privilege. Your great Charter of Hen. VIII. hath no mention at all of it: But Cambridge, which had the like Charter, found that defect in it, and repaired to the King again, and obtained another particular Charter for Printing only; which is very large, and of great honour and benefit to that University. Where by the way give me leave to tell you, that they of Cambridge have been far more vigilant both to get and keep their Privileges, than you at Oxford have been, for they have gotten this and other of their Privileges confirmed by succeeding Princes, and I think some of them by Act of Parliament, which for Oxford hath not been done. Up∣on consideration of this I thought it very just and equal, that the two Universities should enjoy the same Privileges, especially for Printing. And when I had weighed all Circumstances, I adventured to move his Majesty on your behalf, who, according to his great and princely favour to the University, did most graciously grant it: The motives, which Iu∣sed were principally two, the one that you might enjoy this privilege for Learning equally with Cambridge; and the other, that having many excellent Manuscripts in your Library, you might in time here∣by be encouraged to publish some of them in Print, to the great ho∣nour of that Place, this Church and Kingdom. And now upon the Grant of the like Patent, I doubt not, but you will enter into some pro∣vident Consideration among your selves, how you may set the Press going, and do something worthy of this his Majesty's Favour, and that the World may see it is not granted unto you for nothing. This Patent I delivered according to appointment to Mr. Philip King who paid the Fees, and took order for the safe carrying of it down. But at that time there proved a happy Error in it, which occasioned the sending of it back to have it amended. That Slip was but in the miswriting of one word, which escaped them, whom (for want of Leisure my self) I set to compare it. The necessity to have this word mended, begat a desire to have a whole Clause added, contain∣ing a privilege of sole Printing such M. S. as you should set forth for a certain number of years. The more I thought of this Clause, the more I found it necessary, and therefore moved his Majesty again for this But when it was granted, Mr. Attorney (to whose care and love not only in this, but in divers other things the University is very much beholden) did not think it fit to have the former Patent recalled, that this might be added; for that would have been the same in charge
with a new Patent, being again to pass the King's hand, and all the Seals, but not in profit to you. Therefore after a great deal of debate, I resolved by advice to move his Majesty for a second Patent, which may recite the former, and be in the nature of a Confirmation of it, and then add all those many Clauses, which concern the sole Printing not only of M. SS. but of any other Books made, and Printed there, and against the importation of all such, as shall be reprinted beyond the Seas, as you will see more perfectly by the ampleness of the Patent it self. This being now finished, I here send you down both the Patents A second Pa∣tent procured, together, but with this proviso, of which you must be very careful. The Priviledge is given to you to name your three Printers; but after they are named and settled by Convocation, they may perchance for∣get themselves and you, and do some things prejudicial to the Honour or Profit of the University, the Right being then as in themselves, tho from you. For prevention of which Inconveniences, and divers others yet unseen, and that both for the present and for the time to come, I think it will be very requisite, First, that you confirm not either of the two Printers which you The Printer; not to be con∣firmed in their places till  some orders concerning them be  led. now have, in any of the Rights of these Patents till all Orders concer∣ning them be setled. Secondly, that you name as yet no third Prin∣ter, but keep the place empty, that you may get an able man, if it be possible for the Printing of Greek, when you shall be ready for it. Thirdly, that you settle some Orders of Agreement beforehand be∣tween your Printers, and your other Stationers there, which print not. Fourthly, that though your Patents be large, yet coming over the Heads of the King's Printers and other Stationers here in London, I shall advise you not to suffer any of your Printers as yet to print Bibles, Service-Books, Grammars, Primers, &c. (which caused the late and chargable Controversy betwixt Cambridge and them;) but let your Pri∣vilege settle a while, and gather strength quietly. Lastly, such Or∣ders, as shall be thought fit to be made for the limiting of your Prin∣ters, and keeping them in due obedience to the University upon all oc∣casions (which may be  advised on by you, that are upon the place) I think, may now very fitly be inserted into a Chapter by them∣selves among the Statutes, that so they may have the more binding Authority over them. And what else you may fittingly think of I leave to your selves. Mr. Mottershed, according to your direction, hath paid the Fees of this second Patent, as Mr. Philip King did of the first; but being a far larger Patent the Charge must needs rise higher. Yet I have gone the nearest way I could. As for the Bill of Charges, Mr. Mottershed will send it you down. I hope I shall not need to put you in mind of writing a very good Letter of Thanks to his Majesty, and I leave it to your Consideration, whether you will not think it fit to write to Mr. Attorney, who for the first Patent would take no Fees, and to Mr. Secretary Windebank, who put them to the King's hand, and ordered them to the Seals, and would take no Fee for either, which hath not a little lessened your Charges. So wishing, that these Patents may turn to the Honour and
Happiness of that place, I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest, To my very loving Friends, the Vice Chancellour, the Doctors, the Proctours, and the rest of the Con∣vocation of the University of OXFORD.

THis ensuing passage of my Letters I desire may be read to the A passage of my Letters to the Vice-Chancellour , &c. Heads at the next meeting, the rather because I know, and am sorry for it, that divers things concerning Form, especially in the younger sort are not in so good order, as some men would make me believe they are; and tho' you complain not much your self, yet I can hear by strangers, how the Market goes. For I am told by di∣vers, that tho' the Masters come very duly in Caps, which I am right glad to hear of; yet the younger sort, which should be most in awe, are least in order, and came not (divers of them) to St. Mary's in that Form, which they ought to do. Which Disorder of theirs cannot possibly be remedied, by the Care of the Vice-Chancellour only, be it never so great. But it must be done by the Heads in their several Colleges, who must either punish such, as they find faulty, or put up their Names to the Vice-Chancellour, that he may. I thought fit therefore now before my entrance upon this my long and tedious Jour∣ney, to desire you for the publick, and every Head of College and Hall in their several Houses respectively, to see that the Youth conform them∣selves to the publick Discipline of the University, that his Majesty, who is graciously sensible of all the defects of that Place, may at his return hear a good and true Report of things amended there; which, as it will much advantage the place it self, so will it also much advance the Reputation of the several Governours in his Majesty's good Opini∣on. And particularly I pray see, that none, Youth or other be suffered to go in Boots and Spurrs, or to wear their Hair undecently long, or with a Lock in the present fashion, or with flasht Dublets, or in any light or garish Colours. And if Noblemen will have their Sons court Concerning Noble Mens , their conforming themselves to the Discipline of the Univer∣sity. it too soon, and be more in, that is, out of fashion than the rest, the fault shall be their own, not mine: But under that Degree, I will have no Dispensation for any thing in this kind. And it were very well, if they to whose Trust they are committed, would fairly and seasona∣bly take some occasion (especially hereafter at their first coming) to acquaint the Lords, their Fathers, with the course of Discipline in the University, that their Sons may conform in every thing, as others do, during the time of their aboad there, which will teach them to know differences of places and orders betimes; and when they grow up to be Men it will make them look back upon that place with Honour to it, and Reputation to you. And of this and all other Particulars of like nature, I shall look for an Account from you, if God bless me with a safe Return. In the mean time I commend my Love heartily both to your self, and to all the Heads, and desire mutual Return of your Prayers, as you have mine daily. May 10. 1633. GVIL. London.
In this first year of Dr. Duppa's Vice-Chancellourship, the Dele∣gates An Order a∣bout hastning the New Sta∣tutes. were often called upon, both my self and him, to hast∣en the Statutes. But that Business went on very slowly. Hereupon I writ very often down to quicken them, and laid before them the necessity of that work, But little would be done, till I entreated two or three of the Delegates, of whom Mr. Peter Turner of Merton-Coll. was one, to set themselves more closely to the work. In this year the Wall about the Phisick Garden, which was divers Phisick Gar∣den. years in doing, was compleatly finish't. In this year the upper end of the Queens-College Chappel was floored Queen's-Col∣lege Chappel. with Marble. AFter my hearty Commendations, &c. I have put my Vice-Chan∣cellour Dr. Duppa con∣tinued Vice-Chancellour. a second year. to a great deal of Care and pains in this year of his Go∣vernment, which is now drawing to a happy end. And the more I consider, how discreetly and worthily he hath carried himself both towards me and towards the whole Body of the University, the more I am made doubtful whether I or you be most beholden to him. For my part, as I give him thanks for his pains past, and his vigi∣lance in that laborious Office: So at this time, being my self absent in remoter parts to do his Majesty such service, as I am commanded, I must needs think it very fit to leave the Government in his hands for the year ensuing, who hath managed it so exceeding well in the year, that is past. And I doubt not, but herein I give both the Heads of Houses, and that whole Body, very great satisfaction: Be∣cause I assure my self, the experience which he hath had will make him the better able for the year to come. And upon this Ground I do make choice of him to be my Vice-Chancellour for this year fol∣lowing. These are therefore to pray and require you to allow of this my Choice of Dr. Duppa, and to give him your best Counsel and assistance in all Business, which may any way concern the Government and the Honour of that famous University. And so I bid you very heartily Farewel, and rest, To my very loving Friends, the Vice-Chancellour, the Doctors, the Proctours, and the rest of the Convocation of the University of OXFORD.

AFter our hearty Commendations to your Lordship. There being A Letter to me from the Lords Com∣missioners for the Navy a∣bout the Uni∣versity Privi∣leges for Car∣riages. a great quantity of Timber to be carried out of his Majesty's Forrests of Shotover and Stowood, for the use of his Majesty's Navy, It pleased the Lords of his Majesty's Privy Counsel to appoint the Counties of Berks, Buckingham, and Oxon. to join in perfor∣mance of those Carriages for the better ease of that service, being more, than hitherto hath been known. And understanding, that it will be a great Delay and prejudice to this so important a service, if any persons shall be exempted, and yet being unwilling to press any thing, that may be misinterpreted, or trench on the Privileges of the Uni∣versity of Oxon. which divers (otherwise liable to this work) resort unto, to avoid this his Majesty's service. We pray your Lordship to take some course by such way, as you shall think fairest, and without prejudice to the Privileges of that University, that a Business of so much consequence, tending only to the publick and general good, and strengthning of the whole Kingdom, may (for the encouraging of other places neighbouring) be cheerfully performed by those, who live within the parts claiming to be exempt from any such Carriages. And we shall have a care, that they shall not henceforth be troubled on any particular or less important occasion, as tendering the good and advancement of the Vniversity and the Privileges thereof above any particular or private Respects. And so we bid your Lordship heartily farewel. From White-Hall this 15 day of August 1633. To the Right Reverend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of London Your Lordship's very loving Friends, Portland. Lindsey. Fran. Cottington. Fran. Windebank. At the Vespers upon the 6 of July Dr. Heylin,  of the Pro∣ceders, had these Questions following out of the 20th Article of the Certain passa∣ges utterd by Dr.  upon Dr. Hey∣lins Questions at the Vespers, on July 6. 1633. Church of England. Ecclesia authoritatem habet in fidei controversiis deter minandis. Ecclesia authoritatem habet interpretandi Sacras Scripturas. Ecclesia potestatem habet decernendi Ritus & Ceremonias. Upon these Questions Dr. Prideaux then Professour had these passa∣ges following, and were then offered to be avowed against him upon Oath, if need were; and it happened that the Queens-Almoner was present. The passages were these:
Ecclesia est mera Chimaera. Ecclesia nihil docet nec determinat. Controversiae omnes meliùs ad Academiam referri possunt, quam ad Ecclesiam. Docti homines in Academiis possunt determinare omnes Con∣troversias, etiam sepositis Episcopis. Upon an occasion of mentioning the absolute Decree, he brake into a great and long Discourse, that his Mouth was shut by Authority, else he would maintain that Truth contra omnes qui sunt in Vivis, which fetcht a great Hum from the Country Ministers, that were there, &c. These particulars by the Command of his Majesty I sent to Dr. Dr. Prideaun's answer to these particulars re∣ceived August 22 Ex. Act. 20. Prideaux, and received from him this answer following, and his Pro∣testation under his hand. Ecclesia authoritatem habet in fidei Controversiis determinandis. Ecclesia authoritatem habet interpretandi Sacras Scripturas. Ecclesia potestatem habet decernendi Ritus & Ceremonias. These Questions I approved, when they were brought unto me, and wished the Beadle, that brought them, to convey them to the Con∣gregation to be allowed according to Custom; conceiving them to be especially bent (according to the meaning of the Article cited) against Papal Vsurpations and Puritancial Innovations, which I detest, as much as any man, Whereby it appears, what I posi∣tively hold concerning the authority of the Church in all the propo∣sed Particulars, namely that which that 20th Article prescribeth, and not otherwise. Certain passages that came from Dr. Prideaux in the discussing of the Questions at Oxford. Ecclesia est mera Chimaera. Ecclesia nihil docet nec determinat. Controversiae omnes melius ad Academiam referri possunt, quàm ad Ecclesiam. Docti homines in Academiis possunt determinare omnes Controver∣sias, etiam sepositis Episcopis. The passages therefore imperfectly catched at by the Informer were no Positions of mine. For I detest them, as they are laid, for impious and ridiculous. But Oppositions according to my place, proposed for the further clearing of the truth, to which the Respon∣dent
was to give satisfaction; And the General Protestation I hope, takes off all, that can be laid against me in the particulars. Notwithstanding to touch on each of them, as they are laid. To the First, I never said the Church was Mera Chimaera, as it is, or hath a Being, and ought to be believed. But as the Respon∣dent by his Answer made it. In which I conceived him to swerve from the Article, whence his Questions were taken. To the Second, my Argument was to this purpose; Omnis actio ést Suppositorum vel Singularium; Ergo  in abstracto nil docet aut determinat, sed per hos aut illos Episcopos, Pastores, Doctores: As, Homo non disputat, sed Petrus & Johannes, &c. The third, and fourth may be well put together. My Prosecution was, That the Universities are eminent Parts and Seminaries of the Church, and had sitter opportunity to discuss Controversies, than di∣vers other Assemblies. Not by any means to determine them, but to prepare them for the determination of Ecclesiastical Assemblies, of Synods, Councils, Bishops, that have Superiour Authority, wherein they might do Service to the Church and those Superiours; not prescribing any thing unto them. As the debating of a thing by a learned Counsellour makes the easier Passage for the Benches Sentence. And this was urged only as Commodum, not as Necessarium. The QUEEN's ALMONER present. I am told no. For he departed, as they say, that were in the Seat with him, being tyred as it should seem by the tedious Pre∣face of the Respondent before the Disputations began: But be it so or otherwise, to what purpose this is interposed, I know not. Upon an occasion of mentioning the absolute Decree, he brake into a great and long Discourse, that his Mouth was shut by Authority; else he would maintain the truth contra omnes, qui sunt in vivis, which fetcht a great Hum from the Country Ministers that were there, &c. This Argument was unexpectly cast in by Mr. Smith of St. John's; but bent, as I took it, against somewhat I have written in that behalf; which the Respondent not endeavouring to clear, I was put upon it to shew, in what sense I took absolutum Decretum: Which indeed I said I was ready to maintain against any, as my Predecessors in that place had done. This was not in a long Discourse, as it is suggested, but in as short a Solution, as is usually brought in Schools to a Doubt on the bye. And from this I took off the Opponents farther proceeding in Obedience to Authority. Whereupon if a Hum succeeded, it was more than I used to take notice of. It
might be as well of dislike as approbation, and of other Auditors, as soon as Country Ministers: A Hiss I am sure was given before, when the Respondent excluded the King and Parliament from being parts of the Church. But I remember whose practice it is to be . I had rather bear and forbear, and end with this. PROTESTATION. THAT as I believe the Catholick Church in my Creed, so I Dr. . his Protestati∣on. Reverence this Church of England wherein I have had my Baptism and whole Breeding, as a most eminent Member of it. To the Doctrine and Discipline of this Church have I hitherto often subscribed, and by God's Grace constantly adhered; and resolve by the same assistance, according to my ability, (under his Majesty's Prote∣ction) faithfully to maintain against Papists, Puritans, or any other, that shall oppose it. The Prelacy of our Reverend Bishops in it I have ever defended in my Place to be jure Divino, which I dare say has been more often, and with greater pains taking, than most of those have done, who have receiv'd greater Encouragement from their Lordships. I desire nothing but the continuance of my vo∣cation in a peaceable Course, that after all my pains in the place of his Majesty's Professor almost for these 18 years together, my Sons especially be not countenanced in my declining Age to vilify and vex me. So shall I spend the remainder of my time in hearty Prayer for his Majesty, my only Master and Patron, for the Reverend Bishops, the State, and all his Majesty's Subjects, and Affairs, and continue my utmost Endeavours to do all faithful Service to the Church, where∣in I live. To whose Authority I ever have, and do hereby submit my self and Studies to be according to Gods word directed or cor∣rected. J. Prideaux.

Whereas by the Customs, Liberties and Privileges of this University of Oxon. by Kings and Queens of this Realm of England granted, My Proclama∣tion for a Toll∣gatherer in Oxford, &c. May 2. 1634. and by Acts of Parliament confirmed unto the said University, amongst other noble Privileges and Favours, the Clerkship of the Market within the said University, and the allowing, approving, and correcting of Weights and Measures, and the well ordering and govern∣ing the sd. Market for the benefit of the sd. University and the Buyers and Sellers therein, is granted and confirmed to the Chancellour, Masters, and Scholars of the said University of Oxon. and the Execution
thereof to the Chancellour or his Deputy, the Vice-Chancellour of of the said University for the time being: And whereas we find, that heretosore in our Predecessors times, there hath been a publick Offi∣cer by them assigned and appointed to look to the cleansing and keep∣ing sweet the Market Place, and to take the just and due Toll for the Measuring of Corn and Grain, and to keep true and equal Bushels, Pecks, and Half-Pecks, that there be no fraud committed between the Buyer and the Seller; which said Office hath of late times been discontinued; By reason whereof, as we are certainly informed, di∣vers Citizens of the City of Oxon. inhabiting in or near the said Corn-Market, have (of their own will without any approbation of us or our Vice-Chancellour) taken upon them to keep and set forth on Mar∣ket days publick Bushels and Measures for the measuring of Corn and Grain, and take Toll for the same without stint or Limitation, sometimes a Pint, sometimes a Pint and an half, and sometimes a Quart for the measuring of a Bushel, whereas the ancient and laudable due is but half a Wine Pint at the most for such measure. And also that divers Maltsters, Bakers, and Brewers do keep in their Private Houses two Bushels, a bigger wherewith to buy, and a lesser to sell, whereby the Country, that bring in their Corn and Grain to the said University, are deterred to furnish the said Market, in regard the measure of Grain will not hold out fully with the said great Bu∣shels. We therefore for the future prevention of the said Inconve∣niences, and for the better Government of the said Market, that there be no fraud used, Have given, granted, and confirmed, and do by these presents give, grant, and confirm, unto Christopher  val, Inhabitant within the said University of Oxon. Licence, power, and authority to keep and set forth every Market-Day in the place of the Corn-Market so many lawful Bushels and Measures by us, or our Christopher Di∣val chosen Tol-gatherer. Deputies to be allowed and sealed, as shall be sufficient for the Mea∣suring of the said Corn or Grain, so brought to be sold in the said Uni∣versity, and to take the due and lawful Toll for the same, (viz.) the Quantity of half a Wine Pint at the most in every Bushel, and not above: To have and to hold the said Office of keeping the said Bu∣thels and Measures, and receiving the Toll as aforesaid to him the said Christopher Dival (during his natural life) without the lett, trouble, hindrance, or denial of any the Inhabitants of the City and University of Oxon keeping Bushels as aforesaid or any other Person whatsoever. And we do also by these presents straitly prohibit and discharge all the Inhabitants of the University or City of Oxon. from keeping and setting forth any publick Bushel or other measure, and to receive any Toll or profit for the same: And also all Malsters, Bakers, and Brewers for keeping in their Houses any more than a lawful and sealed Bushel, by which they shall sell, as well as buy, Provided always, that the said Christopher Dival demean himself honestly, uprightly, and indifferently in the Exe∣cution of the said Office or place as aforesaid, and that he take a Cor∣poral Oath yearly before us, or our Deputy the Vice-Chancellour, to that effect and purpose, according to the Law, and the Use, Cus∣tom, and Privilege of the said University: And provided also, that the said Christopher Dival in Consideration of the Premises, do
take diligent care to view the Pitching, Paving, and Cleansing of the Streets within the said University, and to make known unto us or our Deputy, by whose fault and negligence the same is left undone, and also that twice every Week after the end of the said Market he cleanse and keep sweet, or cause to be cleansed and kept sweet the said Corn-Market Place, the Inhabitants there paying to the Scavinger as now they do for the same. In witness whereof We have to these Presents put our Hand and Seal, Dated the 2d. day of May, Anno Dom. 1634. And in the Tenth year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King Charles, of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c.

And to this end I require you, that are the Principal of the said Hall, to dispose of those Scholars, that are now under his Tuition to such other Tutors, who by their discreet and peaceable Carriage shew themselves freest from Faction; and not to suffer the same or any other to live under his Charge, or him to re∣ceive any Salary or Stipend from them. And this Censure you are presently to put in execution, by taking away his Scholars, and to take care, that no part of it hereafter be eluded. Of the performance of which, you are to stand accomptable to the Chancellor or his Vicechancellor whensoever you shall be called. After I had received Letters from the University of the 12. of Sept. An Order a∣bout the set∣ling of the Sta∣tutes, 12. Sep. 1633. 1633. which gave me the whole power to order and settle the Sta∣tutes, which had now hung long in the hands of the Delegates, though before they had put me to much pains, and the writ∣ing of many Letters both to call upon and direct the Delegates yet; now I set my self to it with so much the greater alacrity, because the University having in Convocation put the whole business into my Hands, I thought my self sure against all practice by faction or other∣wise. To the end therefore, that I might have no more Jealousie nor Crossing in the Business, I put the Review of all that had been done formerly by the Delegates, into the Hands of Mr. Peter Turner of Merton College, reserving to my self the last Consideration of all: By this means and God's Blessing upon my endeavours, I did at last not without a great deal of pains, get through this work, and settled the Statutes, as will after appear in its proper time and place.
In this Year the West-side of Vniversity College was new built University College. from the Ground. John Dunn of C. C.

AFter my very hearty Commendations, &c. I have laid the Dr. Pink ap∣pointed Vice∣chancellor. pains of tho Vicechancellorship now two years together upon Dr. Duppa, who hath discharged that place with extraordinary Care, as well for the good, as the honour of the University; and God hath blessed his Endeavours with very great success in those things which have fallen under his Charge both at home and abroad. And I dare be bold to affirm it to you in his behalf (and yet give him but the Testimony which he deserves) that he hath merited exceeding much both from my self and from you. Nevertheless I am not wil∣ling either to overload him,  to pass by so many able and worthy Men as that University (God be thanked) now hath for the supply of that place, and who I doubt not will in their several turns follow the good example of those who have gone worthily before them. At this time I have thought fit to name Dr. Pink, Warden of New Coll. to be Vicechancellor for this year ensuing, of whose Wisdom, Judgment, and Integrity, and all other Abilities, fit to fill that place, I have particular knowledge; and assurance for these divers years, and am very desirous to make him as well known to you as he is to my self: These are therefore to pray and require you to allow of this my nomination and choice of Dr. Pink to the Vice∣chancellorship, and to give him your best advice and assistance in all such things as may any ways concern the Honour and good Go∣vernment of the University. So I bid you all heartily farewell, and rest your loving Friend and Chancellor To my loving Friends the Vice∣chancellor, the Doctors, the Pro∣ctors, and the rest of the Convoca∣tion of the University of Oxford. W. CANT. Lambeth July 12. 1634. AFter my hearty Commendations, &c. The Statutes of the U∣niversity, My Letters to the Convocati∣on about pub∣lishing  Sta∣tutes, &c. so often and by so many undertaken and left again, are now by God's blessing, and the great pains of them, to whom that Care was committed, brought to perfection. This work, I hope,
God will so bless, as that it may much improve the Honour and good Government of that Place; a thing very necessary in this Age both for Church and Common Wealth, since so many young Gen∣tlemen and others of all Ranks and Conditions have their first breeding for the publick in that Seminary. To save the Purse of the University, and to gain time, it was thought fit rather to Print, than to transcribe so many Copies as might serve for the present necessary use of the University and the several Colleges and Halls respectively. And for my part I thought it expedient, that in every House they might have the Rule of the publick Government by them, and so see the way to their Duty: which being as much for their particular good, as the advance of the publick service, every man, I hope, will be most willing and ready to conform himself to that, which is requi∣red The Statutes to be publish'd for a years pro∣bation. of him. There is to be a great Ledger Book written out fair, which is to be the Authentick Copie under Seal, and to rest in Archivis, to be the future Judge of all Statutes, which may hereafter be corruptly either printed or transcribed. But before this be written, I hold it very expedient to put these Statutes (as they are now corrected and set in order) into practice and execution for the space of one whole year, to the end it may better appear, if any necessary thing have slipt the Care of my self, and those, whom the University trusted with me. For then if any such thing be discovered, it may easily be amended in the Margent, or otherwise of these printed Books. And after this experience made, the Authentick Copy may be written fair, without any Interlining or other Blemish, and so be a Rule to Posterity of greater Credit. These are therefore according to the power given unto me by an Act, with full Consent in Convocation, bearing Date in August, 1633. to declare and publish to the University and every Member thereof, that the Statutes now printed are and shall be the Statutes, by which that University shall be governed for this year en∣suing, that is, until the Feast of St. Michael the Arch-Angel, which shall be in the year of our Lord God 1635. reserving to my self Power, according to the Decree before mentioned, to add or alter that, which shall be fit, and take away from these Statutes or any of them that, which shall be found by this intervening Practice to be either unnecessa∣ry or incommodious for that Government. And then, (God willing) at or before that time I will discharge the Trust, which the Univer∣sity hath commended to me, and absolutely make a settlement of the Statutes for future times, even as long as it shall please God to bless them with use and continuance. And I account it not the least of God's Blessings upon my self, that he hath given me strength and ability to do this Service for my ancient Mother, the University, whom I have ever so much Honoured, and am still ready to serve. And thus much Comfort I can already give you, that his Majesty being made acquainted by me, that the work was finisht, exprest extraordinary contentment in it, and command∣ed me to let you know so much, and withal that he doubts not of your ready Obedience to them: Than which nothing can from  be more acceptable to him. Thus assuring my self, that you will all strive to yeild full Obedience to these your Statutes, which will be your own Honour as well
as the Universities, I leave you to God's blessed Protection, and rest, To my very Loving Friends, the Vice-Chancel∣lour, the Doctors, the Proctors, and the rest of the Convocation of the University of OXFORD.

S. in Christo. AFter my very hearty Commendations, &c. I have a good while since My Letters to the Convocati on concern∣ing the Book of the Statutes de∣livered to the King and Sir Kenelm Digby's Manuscrspts, &c. delivered the Book of your Statutes together with your Letters to his Sacred Majesty who was marvellously well pleased with both and commanded me at some convenient Leisure to let you know, how well he takes both the one and the other. And because the Letter you sent was very well written, after his Majesty had read it, I caused it to be fairly written in the spare Vellum at the beginning of the Book. Thus much I had signified to your self, and the whole Body of the Convocation about a Month since, had I not been hindred by two things, the one as troublesome to my self as the other will appear beneficial to you. That which was troublesome to my self was the great Business of the Term, which lay very heavy upon me, especially towards the end of it, and at the same time the Care which I took to de∣rive the benefit upon you. That which I know will be very benefi∣cial Manuscripts gi∣ven by Sir  Digby to the University to you is a parcel of Manuscripts which I have obtained for your Library from a very Learned and Noble Gentleman, Sir Kenelm Digby. These Manuscripts (many of them being very good) he hath been at the Charge to Bind up, and put his Arms fair upon them, and I think there are very few but so bound. With these he hath sent a Catalogue, but that (as himself tells me) is somewhat imperfect, his Man being indisposed for health, at the time when he made it. And whether the method of it will like you or fit the University I know not. But after the Books are compared with this, it will be very easy to make a perfect one by it. For my self I did not think it fit any way to meddle with them, but have left them in their several Trunks, as they were packed up by himself, and so sent them to you. Their number is 235. or thereabouts. Concerning the Manuscripts I am to give two Advertisements of Two Advertise∣ments of Sir Ken. Digby con∣cerning his Ma∣nuscripts to be observed. the Donors Will and Pleasure, which I must and do pray you to set∣tle in this present Convocation: The one is, that he will not subject these Manuscripts to the strictness of Sir Thomas Bodley's Statute, but will have Liberty given for any man of worth, that will be at the Pains and Charge to Print any of these Books, to have them out of the Library upon good Caution given, and to that purpose and no other. The Second is, that he will reserve Liberty to himself, during his natural Life, to borrow any of these Books out of the Library for his own private use, whensoever he shall ask them. And both of us desire the Books may be put into the Library with these two Cautions expresly mentioned, as the Act of Convocation was for the Books which my Lord Steward gave. This is all which I have for the present to trouble you with, for I presume I shall not need to put you in mind of writing a Letter of Thanks to Sir Kenelm Digby whose love thus and divers other ways express'd deserves it abundantly; so with my Prayers to Almighty
God to bless you to the honour of his Sacred Name, and the good of his Church, I leave you to his gracious Protection. To my very loving Friends, the Vice∣chancellor, the Doctors, the Pro∣ctours, and the rest of the Convoca∣tion of the University of Oxford. Decemb. 19. 1634. Your very loving Friend and Chancellor W.

E domo nostrae Congregationis Decemb. 24. 1634. Sanctitati vestrae Devotissima Acad. Oxon. At this time there was a Proposition made for setting the Poor on A Project to set the Poor of Oxford on work Decemb. 28. 1634. work at Oxford, by making New Stuffs and Drapery Ware, much after the fashion that the Dutch and Walloons use at Canter∣bury, Norwich, and other places. Divers Letters passed between me and the Vicechancellor and some other interessed men about it: But in Conclusion such difficulties appeared in the Business, that the whole project suddainly vanished, and came to nothing. And yet Mr. Escott of Wadham College, who very carefully, and certainly with a very good intention laboured in the Business, gave me this Answer following to such Doubts as I had made. And set down some other things very considerable in the business; And yet for all this that good intention fell to nothing. THE Doubts that you have made to me, I think in part be thus Mr. Escots an∣swer to certain of mine con∣cerning the Poor of Ox∣ford. Recep. March the 10. 1635. answered. To the First. The Man John Roberts of Yarmouth, and born there, is a man as I suppose, conformable; for I have heard him speak with dislike of some sactious Brethren of the Town of Yarmouth, and of some of this Town of Oxford. And he commends Mr. Brook the Minister of Yarmouth, and particularly for a Suit that he lately commenced in the High Commission against a factious Lecturer for preaching scandalously of the Blessed Virgin, &c. by reason of which Suit I suppose the said Minister and his Conformity is known to my Lord's Grace of Canterbury. To the Second. If this Man die, another may be had upon the same Terms: But if he live any time, he will make his own Sons, and o∣thers perfect in the Trade, that may supply the place after him. To the Third. I hope we shall not need to fear the making us a number of Poor by them, that shall be trained up in this Trade, because this Course encreaseth not the number of Poor, but only teaches them, whom it finds idle, and enables them to maintain themselves and their Families, if they have any; for it employs both Men, Women and Children; and where there be no Idlers, 'tis like there will not be many Beggars.
To the Fourth. I find not indeed that we have power to impose a Tax upon Ale-houses. To the Fifth. The Taxes and Levies now made by the Town for the Poor, (are by the Statute) to be employed and disposed of by the Overseers of the Poor, with the consent of two Justices of Peace, for the providing of Materials to set them to Work, and for the placing out of poor Children to honest Trades. Now if the Overseers of this Work be made Justices of Peace, I see not but they may have a hand in disposing of those Taxes, and convert as much of them as shall be fit to this use. However the University may by its own power tax all privileged men. There is a man of good Place in the Town (who is like to be a Benefactor to this Work) that thinks the Town, if the University go through with it, will willingly Bind themselves to a yearly Con∣tribution towards it, or else will undertake to maintain constantly a certain number of Children, which shall work there. But if none of these things be, I think there may be shewn a way, how the U∣niversity of its self, without the assistance of the Town, may be able to go on with this charitable Work, and provide for the maintaining and teaching Sixty poor Children the first year, and add to them 20 or 30 more every year perpetually; and yet so, that whatsoever any man shall contribute towards it, shall return to him within the com∣pass of the year with advantage. Which way may be this. There must be raised a Sum of Money, that shall issue out year∣ly for the maintaining of a certain number at work; suppose sixty or an hundred. This yearly Charge shall never increase, and yet the number to be maintained shall increase every year, thus; Suppose there be eighty to be maintained as Apprentices for seven years, at five pounds charge for every Child per annum. The first year, their Earnings will but answer their Spoilings. The second year, this Eighty will earn 120 l. which will take in twenty four Children more. The third year, the first eighty will earn 200 l. and the 24 taken in the 2d year will earn 36 l. in all 236 l. Out of which deduct to maintain the 24 taken in the second year 120 l. and there will remain 116 l. which will take in 23 more. The fourth year the first Eighty will earn 280 l. and the rest will earn so as to take in 30 more. The fifth year will take in 40 more, the sixth year 50. The seventh 40. The Eighth year, The first Eighty shall be manumitted, and yet there will be left at work 204. and there may be taken in 30 more.
The ninth year will manumit the 24, that were taken in the Se∣cond year, and there will be left at work 210. And so always a certain number will go off yearly, as they come in, and others will be taken in their room. If there be taken in but 60 the first year, there will be added the second year 20. the third year 16. the fourth year 20. the fifth 30. the sixth 40. and so onward as it is shewed before. If the Town contribute towards it, there may be taken in the first year 100. If the University go on alone, they may (besides the allowance of the Master and Overseers) take in 60, by raising through the University by the Pole 1 d. a Week upon every man, except poor Scholars; or by setting a certain Sum upon every College, to be raised, as it shall seem meet to the Governours. Now if any man think this 1 d. a Week to be a Burthen, I answer him thus: First, that upon the matter he doth not give any thing, but only lays out by the Week what within the Year will come in to him again, in the Buying of his Gowns, Suits, Stockings, &c. Neither is this a thing only in imagination, but it may easily be made to appear, that if things be well ordered, there shall be saved in some Stuffs 4 d. in some 6 d. in some 8 d. a Yard, in some more, in some less, as it is of higher or lower price, and in Stockings after the same proportion. Secondly, I think I may say, there is well nigh as much as this given every Week at Buttery-Hatches, and to Beggars in the Town, which by this means might be saved; for if a right course be taken there should not be seen a Beggar or an idle Person within the Pre∣cincts of the University. Thirdly, I believe, that my Lord Keeper,  Petitioned by the University, will easily be induced (in regard of the undertaking of this work,) to keep this University out of all Breves, which now come very frequently upon us, and that we shall be burthened with no Collections, save only some extraordinary ones, that shall first pass the Consent and approbation of my Lord our Chancellour. If this may perswade, that the Enterprize is feasible, it were good, that all the Dispatch were made in it, that may be, that the Work may begin with the Year, now at our Lady-Day. If the Overseers were made, they might travel in the perfecting of it, and enquire, what were the Causes of their first failings in Cambridge, and how they do now go through with it, as likewise what Course they take at Norwich, where this Trade hath a good while flourished, and so, that it leaves not (as I am informed) a Beg∣gar in the whole Country thereabouts.

The Repair and Beautisying of the Chappel of Saint Mary Mag∣dalane, Magdalane College. which began the Year before I was Chancellor, was com∣pleatly finished; as also another new Building of theirs towards the Waterside in this Year. In this Year Smith-gate was made passable for Coaches. Smith-gate. In this Year the Thames was brought up to Oxford, and made Na∣vigable Thames brought up to Oxford. for Barges. Henry Birkhead of Trinity College in Oxford was seduced by a Jesu∣ite, Henry Birkhead of Trinity Col. seduced by  Jesuite. and in May 1635. carried to St. Omers by one, who called him∣self by the name of Kemp, a Priest of that College of St. Omers: They took shipping at Dover, and there they were not so much as ask∣ed their Names by any Officer, nor ever tendred the Oath of Allegi∣ance: But I found means to get him back and settled him. AFter my hearty Commendations, &c. The time of the Year Dr. Pink conti∣nued  another year. puts me in mind that the Vicechancellor hath gone through a years Pains in that Government, and the place being so full of trouble, a Year may be thought a great space of time for any man to be exercised in it: Yet considering what experience is requisite for a Governour there, and in hope that the first Year's pains will make the labour of the second more easy, and especially weighing with my self, with what great sufficiency both for Integrity and Judgment the present Vicechancellor, Dr. Pink, hath carried himself in all the Businesses, which concerned the Honour of that University, both at Home and abroad; I have thought fit to continue him another Year in the Vice∣chancellorship; assuring my self that he will constantly go on, as he hath begun, which cannot but tend to his own Credit and Reputati∣on, as well as to the good Government of the University, and all those other happy Effects which attend upon a well settled Government, which is so necessary every where, but more especially in that Body. These are therefore not only to let you know that I do hereby nomi∣nate
and choose Dr. Pink to be my Vicechancellor for this Year fol∣lowing, but also to pray and require you to allow of this my Choice, and to give him all the Respects due to his Place, and all other help and assistance which shall be in your Power to give, and may be ne∣cessary for him to receive for his better Ease and Comfort in the Go∣vernment. Thus not doubting of your Readiness, and willing Obe∣dience herein, I leave both him and you all to the Grace of God, and rest July 10. 1635. Your very loving Friend and Chancellor W. CANT. ANother Business there is, which I think may be very well worthy your Consideration; and if you do not give it remedy (as I think A Branch of my Letters to my Lord of Winchester, con∣cerning New Coll. in Oxon. Feb. 2. 1635. it abundantly deserves) I do not know who either can or will. I have often wondred, why so many good Scholars came from Winchester to New College, and yet so few of them afterwards prove eminent Men: And while I lived in Oxford I thought upon divers things, that might be causes of it, and I believe true ones; but I have lately heard of another, which I think hath done and doth the College a great deal of harm, in the Breeding of their Young men. When they come from Winchester they are to be Probationers two Years, and then Fel∣lows. A man would think those two Years, and some Years after should be allowed to Logick, Philosophy, Mathematicks, and the like Grounds of Learning, the better to enable them to study Divi∣nity with Judgment: But I am of late accidentally come to know, that when the Probationers stand for their Fellowships, and are to be examined how they have profited; One chief thing in which they are examined is, how diligently they have read Calvin's Institutions; Concerning the Probatio∣ners of New Coll. their rea∣ding of Calvin's Institutions too soon. and are more strictly held to it, how they have profited in that, than almost in any kind of Learning besides. I do not deny but that Calvin's Institutions may profitably be read, and as one of their first Books for Divinity, when they are well grounded in other Learning; but to begin with it so soon, I am afraid doth not only hinder them from all grounds of Judicious Learning, but also too much possess their Judgments before they are able to judge, and makes many of them hu∣merous in, if not against the Church. For so many of them have prov∣ed in this latter Age, since my own memory in that University. Your Lordship is Visitor there, and I think you cannot do a better Deed, than to advise on a way, how to break this Business with the Warden who is a learned and discreet Man, and then think upon some  for it. For I am verily perswaded, it doth that College a great deal of harm. I do not hold it fit that your Lordship should fall upon this Business too suddainly. When the Warden comes next to the Election may be a sit time; nor would I have You
let it be known, that you have received this Information from me; but sure I am 'tis true, and needs a Remedy. February 2. 1635. W. CANT.

NON diu abhinc est, quo Literas Patentes Libertates avitas confir∣mantes My Letters to the Convoca∣tion, when the new Sta∣tutes were to be published. & conferentes Novas accepistis. Munus Regium erat; Cura autem mea. Nunc Statuta mitto. Illa vincula secum ducunt, sed accommoda, ne Libertates licentiam induerent, sed vobis grata. Non vel∣let enim Academia esse sine Fraeno, sed in ordinem redacta, ne amplius confusione & contradictionibus subditos oneraret; sed & antiquis valdè consona, (nisi ubi temporum ratio aliud exigit) ne quid novi videretur pa∣ti celeberrima simul & vetustissima Academia. Saepius tentatum hoc opus, & à Viris saeculis suis celeberrimis;
frustra tamen. Nec enim quidquam in hac re ad optatum sinem perduxe∣runt. Sed utrum Operis ipsius difficultas, an aliqua alia interventens remora obstiterit, planè nescio. Quo magis gratulor Academiae, & , quibus Miseratione Divinâ datum est opus hoc ad talem saltem perfectionem, redactum videre, qualem ferre solent Leges & Statuta, quae de quovis par∣ticulari cavere nequeunt. Nec Academioe tantum & vobis, sed & mihimetipsi gratulor, quod Sta∣tuta situ & pulvere tantùm non sepulta, in lucem redacta, & suis numeris titulis{que} distincta video. Multò magis tamen, quòd placuit Academiae in frequenti Convocatione (ne uno refragrante) rem totam ad me, Cu∣ram{que} meam referre, ut sub Incude med Statuta haec limarentur, & à me Confirmationem acciperent. Summa haec vestra Confidentia fuit, & certê gratias omnibus, singulis, ago summas, ob fidem mihi in re tantâ, ac tali jam liberaliter praestitam. Quâ in re certe non fidem,  nec spem vestram fefelli. Verum enim est, & ausim dicere, me summa cum aequitate, cum aequalitate pari omnia transegisses. Et potestatem à venerabili Domo mihi commissam it a moderatum, ut nihil prae oculis habuerim, nisi quod planè in publicum Ec∣clesiae & Academiae bonum cederet. Et hoc (Deum Testor) omnt affectione, partialitate, privato respectu praesentium temporum, personarum, locorum, officiorum qualiumcunque sepositis. Vnum superest non tacendum. Transmisi vobis Statuta, quae annum probationis suae apud vos complevere, jam ex usu illo in nonnullis, emen∣data, & pro potestate à vobis concessa, misi sub sigillis meo vestro{que} in debitâ Juris formâ confirmata. Quum ecce placuit Regi Serenissimo, Mu∣sis{que} vestris addictissimo, suam etiam superadjicere confirmationem manu Commissio∣ners sent by his Majesty a∣bout the pub∣lishing of the Statutes. propriâ & sigillo magno munitam: Quod Academiae honorem, moribus Dis∣ciplinam, Statutis reverentiam & firmitatem nequit non conferre.

Quin & Commissionarios misit suos, qui ob majorem negotii dignitatem, & Statuta haec exhiberent, & Collegiorum & Aula∣rum Praefectos Statutis sic exhibitis & confirmatis subscribere curarent. Reliquum postea erit, ut Statutis sic confirmatis Obedientia praestetur, qud nihil magis poterit augere Academiae splendorem. Et licet primo loco authoritas vestra Legis hasce condendas curavit, ea tamen natura legis est, ut semel condita, & promulgata, non alios tantum, sed & condentes liget. Huic Obedientiae, Reliquis{que} virtutibus quibus polletis, vos semper affines futuros spero, & ut tales sitis, supplicibus precibus se à summo Numine impetratum non dubitat.

These Letters were read in Convocation upon the 22 of June 1636. A Convocation on the 22 of June for the publishing of the new Sta∣tutes. wherein Mr. Secretary Cook made a weighty Speech fitting the occa∣sion; and so likewise did the Vice-Chancellour. Mr. Secretary's Speech follow's in haec verba. Reverend Vice-Chancellour, Doctors and Masters. YOU have heard with due respect and attention the Letters Mr. Secretary  Speech in Convocati∣on at the Pub∣lication of the new Statutes. brought by us to his Sacred Majesty; you have also heard in Conformity thereunto other Letters, sent from your most Reverend Chancellour, signifying his Majesty's Grace and Goodness in recom∣mending unto you this Volume of Statutes, which we now deliver, and you are to receive, as the Rules, by which you must be governed hereafter. You have also seen and heard the Confirmation and Establishment of these Statutes. First by his Majesties Royal Sig∣nature, and under the great Seal of his Kingdom: And respectively under the Hand and Seal of the Lord Arch-Bishop, both as Primate and Metropolitan of England, and as most worthy Chancellour of this University, whereby it is manifest, that these Laws and Ordinan∣ces are so established and ratified both by Sovereign and Subalternal Authority, Temporal and Spiritual, that nothing further can be required, but your ready acceptance and obedience, whereof I make no doubt. For (to do you right) you have already shewed so effe∣ctual Conformity; and at this present express such alacrity and for∣wardness, that I rather see cause to commend and encourage you, than to exhort and stir you up, or any way to importune you by any fur∣ther Speech; yet because there is generally in Man's nature a secret, curiosity and prejudice against all things, that appear extraodinary and new, especially when they impose any Duty, and require obedience at their hands; I must crave leave in discharge of my own Duty to satisfie those, which hereafter may be inquisitive into these Proceedings, to insist a little upon those principal Respects which demonstrate the full Authorization and absolute necessity of submission to these Laws. That which Commands in chief, and which no reason can with∣stand, is his Majesty's Sovereign Power, by which these Statutes (as you see) are both enacted and confirmed. Him we all acknowlege to be our supream Governour both of Church and Commonwealth, over all Causes and Persons; and to his Supremacy and Allegiance, we are all obliged by Oath. This then we must build upon, as an Axiom and fundamental Rule of Government, That all our Laws and Statutes are the King's Laws, and that none can be enacted, changed, or abrogated without him; so all Courts of Law or Equity are properly the King's Courts; all Justice therein administred, be it Civil or Martial, is the King's Justice; and no Pardon or Grace pro∣ceeds from any, but from the King: And as of Justice, so is he the Source of Honour; all Dignities, all Degrees, all Titles, Arms, and Orders come orignally from the King, as Branches from the Root. And not only particular Men and Families, but all Corporations, Societies, nay Counties, Provinces, and depending Kingdoms, have
all Corporations, Societies, nay Counties, Provinces, and depending Kingdoms have all their Jurisdictions and Governments established by him; and by him (for publick good) to be changed or dissolved. So his Power reacheth to Foreign Plantations, where he may erect Principalities, and make Laws for their good Government, which no man may disobey. And as in the temporal, so in the State Eccle∣siastical, his Regal Power by ancient Right extendeth to the erection of Bishopricks, Deanries, and Cathedral Churches, and to settle Orders for Government in all Churches, by the advice of his own , without any Concurrence of Forreign Usurping Power. But for Universities and Colleges, they are the Rights of Kings in a most peculiar manner. For all their Establishments, Endow∣ments, Priviledges and Orders by which they subsist and are main∣tained, are derived from Regal Power. And as it is your greatest Honour, so it is your greatest Safety, That now this Body of your Laws, as well as your Priviledges and Immunities, are established, ratified and confirmed by the King. And more I shall not need to say in this Point. In the next place you may consider for your incouragement to re∣ceive this great Favour and Benefit from his Majesty with ready and thankful Minds, that your Chancellor's worthy Care had a chief operation in advancing this great work; whose nearness to his Ma∣jesty in a place of that Eminency and sincere Conformity to his Or∣ders and Commands, and most watchful Care over that part of the Government which is committed to his Trust, inableth him to sup∣port, and may give you confidence to obey that which his Majesty re∣commendeth by so good a Hand, specially in Matters concerning the good Government of the Church or of the Schools. In the Church (whereof he is Primate and Metropolitan) his Pow∣er is very large, and his extraordinary endeavours in it deserve at least to be well understood. In former times, when Church-men  Rule, the greatest Prelates gave the first way to alienate Church Livings: Whereas this worthy Prelate maketh it his chief work to recover to the Church for the furtherance of God's Service what may be now restored. And what therein he hath effected under his Majesty's gracious and powerful Order, not England alone, but Scotland and Ireland can abundantly witness. Again, what help and relief he procureth dayly for Ministers oppressed by rich incroaching Neighbours or Patrons; what Collections and Contributions he ob∣taineth to re-edify, to repair and adorn Churches; and what great Structures are now in Hand, and much advanced by his Judgment, Care and Zeal in our most famous Monuments dedicated to God's service, we may behold with Joy, and future Ages will  to his Majesty's eternal Glory, by whose Power and Order all is performed, and to the Honour of our Country, and for encourage∣ment and example of those that shall succeed; who will acknow∣ledge with us, that this Man is indeed, as he is by his just stile, a most Reverend and Beneficial Father of the Church: And for this Uni∣versity
what better Evidence can be desired of his singular Love and Beneficence, than first that stately Building, whereby he hath made himself another Founder of that College, which bred him to this height of worth? And secondly, those many rare and exquisite Ma∣nuscripts and Authors, wherewith he hath replenished your renown∣ed publick Library? And if you add hereunto his constant Care to maintain you in all your Rights and Priviledges, and to assist you in your Preferments; And finally in collecting this great Volume of Or∣dinances for the present and further Government of this famous Uni∣versity. You have Monuments sufficient to eternize among you and all men his memory and desert. And this work is that, which now remaineth in the third place to be further stood upon. For 'tis not (as some may think) either a Rhapsody of overworn and unuseful Or∣dinances, nor yet an imposition of Novel Constitutions to serve the present Times; But our Royal Justinian by the Labour and Direction of this prudent person hath collected into a Pandect or Corpus juris Academici all the ancient approved Statutes, which in former times were scattered and so neglected. And tho many great Prelates have heretofore undertaken this Work, yet it ever miscarried, till the piercing Judgment and undefatigible Industry of this man took it in hand, and happily, as now you see, hath put you into possession of it, whereof the use can hardly be valued. For by these Rules, You, that are Governors, may know, what to command, and those, that are under you may know how to obey, and all may understand how to order their Behaviour, and their Studies, whereby they may become most profitable Members in the Church and Common-wealth, which is the main cause, why his Majesty requireth them so strictly to be obeyed. For let me speak freely out of that true affection which I bear to you all: Deceive not your selves with a vain opinion, that Kings and Princes give great Donations, Priviledges and Ho∣nours to their Schools and Universities for a popular Applause, or out of meer Bounty, or for honour, or for opinion of merit, by which the Art of Clergy-men transported them heretofore: But the very truth is, that all wise Princes respect the welfare of their Estates, and con∣sider, that Schools and Universities are (as in the Body) the noble and vital parts, which being vigorous and sound, send good Blood and active Spirits into the Veins and Arteries, which cause health and strength: Or if feeble or ill affected, corrupt all the Vital Powers; whereupon grow Diseases, and in the end death it self. What incon∣veniencies have grown in all Ages by the ill Government and Disor∣ders of Schools, your Books can inform you. And to come home to your selves, have not our late Parliaments complained? Nay hath not the Land exclaimed, that our great Schools of Virtue were be∣come Schools of Vice? This I mention unwillingly, but withal do most willingly tell you to your eternal praise, That fince it pleased his Majesty to take to heart a Reformation, and by advice of your never too often named Chancellor, sent you down some temporary Or∣ders, whereby to reduce you to some reasonable moderation, there∣upon by the Wisdom and Resolution of you the worthy Governours, and by the inclinable conformity of all the Students in general, it is now come to pass, that Scholars are no more found in Taverns or
Houses of Disorder, nor seen loytering in the Streets, or other places of Idleness or ill Example, but all contain themselves within the Walls of their Colleges, and in the Schools or publick Libraries: Wherein, I must confess, you have at length gotten the start, and by your Virtue and Merit have made this University, which before had no Paragon in any forreign Country, now to go beyond it self, and give a glorious Example to others not to stay behind. And if those temporary and unperfect Orders produced so good effect, what may now be expected from this Body of Laws and Sta∣tutes, so compleat and so digested, that no former Age did ever en∣joy the like? Thus you have understood how the Goodness of our great King, how the Care and respect of your Chancellor, and how the worth and substance of the work it self may forcibly induce you to congratulate your own Happiness. And therefore I might here forbear to trouble you any longer with a harsh interrupted Speech: but that I cannot omit to put you in mind of one thing, which I know you will hear with willingness and attention, because it tendeth chiefly to the ho∣nour of our God, and then by his power to the honour of our King; and thence to the comfort of every true hearted Subject who will rea∣dily acknowledg with Reverence and thankfulness the great blessings we now enjoy above all other Nations; I will tell you, but what I know: (for I speak within my Element) I have seen our neighbour∣ing Countries in great Prosperity and Renown, their Cities stately built and strongly fortified, with Walls raised up to Heaven, full of People, full of Trade, so full of peace and plenty, that they surfeited in all excess; but from hence they are since fallen, partly by the boundless Ambition of great Princes, partly by the Factions and Di∣visions in Religion; and generally by their Disorders, into such con∣dition, that men of great Honour sent in remote Employment, found whole Provinces so sack'd and depopulated, that in divers Journeys they incountred scarce a Man, and of those they found dead, some had Grass in their Mouths and Stomachs, and some were torn in pieces by Beasts and ravenous Fowls; and those that were alive had no o∣ther Care or Study than how to save themselves from Fire and Sword. In general there is such Desolation, that without a kind of Horror, the Horror thereof cannot be express'd. Now we by God's Blessing are in a better Case; we sit here in God's House thankful in true Devotion for this wonderful Favour towards us: We enjoy Peace and Plenty; we are like to those who resting in a Calm Haven behold the Shipwrack of others, wherein we have no part, save only in compassion to help them with our Prayers; which we all ought to do as interested in their sufferings, lest the like may fall on us. What then remaineth, but seriously to consider, how all these great Blessings are conferred upon us, not for our Merits, or for our more virtuous and Holy Lives, but only by God's favour to his true Religion: and under him by the happy Government of our Gracious King; which should confirm us all to a Constancy in
our Obedience, and to a ready subjection to all those Rules and Orders, which his Majesty shall prescribe for the Publick good. Wherein this general Admonition may fruitfully be applied to the Business now in hand, whereof I make no doubt. So I crave your pardon and your good acceptance of that, which I have rudely spoken, but with, a true affection to this whole Body, whereof (though I had my Education from another-Nurse) yet I had the Honour to be an Adopted Son, and (as I suppose) one of the ancientest that lives a∣mongst you at this day. It remaineth, that Mr Vice-Chancellour perform his part; and proceed to the Subscriptions and Depositions of you the Heads. John Coke.

Nullibi autem melius locari potest Rex, Mu∣sarum Patronus, quam apud vos & inter Musas; volo autem, ut in Claus∣tris illis, ubi Libri mei Manuscripti siti sunt, collocetur Caput hoc nun∣quam satis venerandum, ut in memoriam vestram revocet, cujus dignatione (sub Deo) factum est, ut illa, qualia qualia sunt, quae in vestram gratiam facta sunt, praestare possem; & ut veluti Inspector ibi stet, nequis Libros, quasi sub intuitu Regis positos ullo modo violare ausit. Nummi mihi novi sunt. Eâ in re Sancto Petro ferè aequalis sum: Coyns sent. Numismata tamen quaedam diuturnâ sollicitudine conquisivi. Acervum nolui vobis mittere, sic enim usui nulli sunt, nisi videre, & numerare ad studiosos pertineat. Redegt ita{que} , quae paravi in , eam{que} doctrinalem, ut per eandem ordinem Saeculorum, & temporum possitis uno quasi intuitu aspicere & per Reversa, ut vocantur, maximas quas{que} sum∣morum Imperatorum actiones, & temporum vices, & accidentia rerum publicarum planius videre, & per ea difficiliora quaedam Historicorum loca meliùs intelligere, & quando{que} de Historiarum Veritate etiam in rebus cog∣nitu necessariis judicare possitis. Numismata haec in quinc{que} Arculas distribui; in qualibet Arcula sunt mul∣tae pixides, quae particularium Numismatum cum Reversis Cellulae quasi & sedes sunt. Has, ubi Numismata non occurrunt, reperietis , sed ordi∣ne suo ita signatas, ut statim possitis invenire, & in iis Numismata repo∣nere, si forte vobis contingat illa acquirere, quae ipse non potui. Vbi autem Cellulae hae sua habent Numismata, locus tamen adhuc superest, ut alia ejusdem
Imperatoris, sed aliis cum reversis possitis ibidem recondere, si quando talia vobis obtinere dabitur. Arculas has quin{que} ita disposui. In primâ sunt Numismata Hebraica & Graeca, non omninò seriatim, sed secundum ordinem, quem Imperatores & Respublicae in antiquâ Graecid liberè ferre possent. In secundâ sunt Familiae Romanorum, è quibus summi illi viri, qui Rempublicam illam evexerunt in Imperium, prodiere. Et hae ordine alphabetico ponuntur, ut citi∣ùs omnibus occurrant, cum ordo vel dignitatis, vel antiquitatis, & diffici∣lior sit, & paucis cognitus, & fortè incertior. In tertiâ, & quartâ sunt Numismata Imperatorum à Julio Caesare ad modernum Imperatorem, & seriatim secundum vices & successiones suas. Sed tertia continet Romam Ethnicam à Julio Caesare ad Constantinum, unà cum Interfectoribus Julii, & aliis, qui licet legitimè Imperatores non fuerint, Nummos tamen cudêrunt. Quarta verò pari methodo Romam Christianam à Constantino Magno, ad Ferdinandum Romano-Germanicum Imperato∣rem nunc rerum potitum. In quintâ demum sunt Numismata Britannorum per omnes, quas subiere, temporum & fortunarum vices, sub Romanis, Saxonibus, Danis, Normannis, sub Heptarchiâ & Monarchiâ à Julio Cae∣sare Insulam hanc invadente, ad Pientissimum & Justissimum Principem, Carolum ejus nominis primum, nunc Regum pacatissimè moderantem: Qui diu floreat & serus in Coelum rediens, Sceptra tuta & faelicia suis re∣linquat. Quo melius haec omnia & vobis innotescant, & posteris, Librum para∣vi, in quo singulo ordine describerentur, quae in quin{que} praedictis Arculis contenta sunt; cum Notulis & Characteribus quibusdam, quibus scire potestis, quae Numismata in Arculis hisce reposita sunt, & quae adhuc desunt, quo diligentius ea indagare satagatis. Librum hunc prae aliis negotiis ad∣huc perficere non potui, saltem non limatius describere, qui unà cum aliis Manuscriptis in Bibliothecâ collocetur; ubi etiam Arculas sitas volo. Sed quamprimum supremam manum apposuero, eum vobis mittam omni Cura servandum.

These Buildings cost me the full, Sum of — The new Convocation House at the West end of the great Li∣brary, with an addition over it to the said Library, was begun to The new Con∣vocationHouse. be built in May 1634. and all the Stone Building was finisht in July 1636.
In this year were the Windows of Queen's-College Chappel glazed The Windows of Queen's Col. Chappel. with coloured Glass, compleatly finisht, which were begun in the year 1633. AFter my hearty Commendations &c. The Time will put both Dr. Baylie Pre∣sident of St. John's chosen Vice-Chancel lour. my self and you in mind, that I have troubled Dr. Pink with the Vice-Chancellourship now two Years together; and I must give him this Testimony, that his Care and Pains together with his Judg∣ment, in managing all business incident to that troublesom Office, hath not only been very great in it self, but hath equalled the best and most careful Endeavours of any his Predecessours. And as I give him hearty thanks for it, so is he much bound to God and my self with him, for the great Blessing with which he hath guided and supported all his Actions. And I cannot but profess unto you, that he hath deserved exceeding well, not of my self only, but of the whole University, and of every Man in particular, whose Sons have been bred there, during the time of this his Government. But for this Vigilancy and pains of his I must not overload him, but think upon some other worthy and able Man to succeed, that may, and will not take upon him the Office only, but go in the same way, into which he hath led him. And after some deliberation I have fixed my resolution upon Dr. Bailye, President of St. John's-Coll. and Dean of Sarum, upon whom I shall be for'cd to lay the greater burthen, if his Majesty hold his Gracious pur pose of Honouring the University with his Presence this present Year: And he will therefore need all the assistance, that either his Predecessours, and the rest of the Heads can give him. These are therefore to pray and require you to allow of this my Nomi∣nation and Choice of Dr. Baylie to the Vice-Chancellourship; and I will not doubt but that you will all afford him your best Advice, Coun∣sel and help, to the performance of all such things, as may any way concern the Honour and good Government of the University. So I bid you all heartily Farewel, and rest, To my very loving Friends, the Vice Chancellour, the Doctors, the Proctors, and the rest of the Con∣vocation of the University of OXFORD. Lambeth, July 12. 1636. Your very loving Friend and Chancellour, W. CANT.
S. in Christo. Sir, SInce I writ last to you, the Dean of Christ-Church came to me, My Letters to the Vice-Chan∣cellour about the settlement of the Plays in Oxford against his Majesties coming. and acquainted me with two things, which are very necessary you should both know and remedy. The one is, that the University seems to be unwilling to contri∣bute to the Charge of the Plays, which are to be at Christ-Church. Now this charge, as by reason of their Building, they are not able to bear alone; So I must needs acknowledge, there is no reason, that they should, whatever their ability be: For the King is to be enter∣tained by Oxford, not by Christ-Church. And that he lyes there, is but for the Conveniency of the place, where there are so many fairLodgings for the great Men to be about him. Indeed if Christ-Church men will say, they will have no Actors, but of their own House, let them bear the charge of their own Plays on God's name: But if they will take a∣ny good Actors from any other College or Hall, upon trial of their suffi∣ciency to be as good, or better than their own; then I see no reason in the World, but that the whole University should contribute to the Charge. And I pray see it ordered, and let your Successour follow you accordingly. The other is, that since the University must contribute to this The University to contribute to the Plays at Christ-Church. Charge, (for so it was done when King James came, and at the last coming of Queen Elizabeth, both within my own memory) I hold it very sit, that all the Materials of that Stage, which are now to be made new, and the Proscenium and such Apparel whatever it be, as is wholly made new, shall be laid up in some place fit for it; to which the Vice-Chancellour for the time being shall have one Key, and the The materials of the Plays to be safely laid up and kept. Dean of Christ-Church the other, that it may not be lost, as things of like nature and use have formerly been. And if any College or Hall shall at any time for any Play or Show that they are willing to set forth, need the use of any, or all of these things, it shall be as lawful, and free for them to have and to use them, as for Christ-Church; Provided that after the use, they do carefully restore them to the place whence they were taken. And to the end these things may be kept with the more safety and indifferency to the University, I think it very fit that an Inventory be made of them, and that one Copy thereof re∣main with them, at Christ-Church, and the other in such fit and con∣venient place, as the Vice Chancellour and the Heads shall agree on. For my part I think it fittest, that an Inventory should be kept in the
University Registry, that so you may not only have access to it, so My Letters concerning the business of the Plays to be registred. often as you shall have cause, but also leave it ready for direction in future times in like Cases of expence. And I think it not amiss, that these my Letters which concern the ordering of these Businesses, should be Registred also. And further, that the University may see, how the Money, which Four experi∣enced men to be appointed to look to the rates of the Ma∣teria's for the Plays. they allow towards these Charges is expended, I think it very requi∣site, that your self and the Heads should name three or four Men of good experience in those things, that may see at what Rates all things are bought and paid for: And an Accompt delivered in to the Vice-Chancellour and the Heads, at such time, as the Vice-Chan∣cellour, shall call for them. And also that, their Hands be set to both Copies of the above named Inventories. I have thought upon Dr. Fell, Dr. Sanders, and the Warden of Wadham, as very fit Men for this purpose; And if you and the Heads shall think it requisite to joyn any more to them, you may name whom you please. For the Play, which I intend shall be at St. John's, I will neither put the University nor the College to any Charge, but take it wholly upon my self. And in regard of the great trouble and Inconvenience, I shall thereby put upon that House, as also in regard it shall set out one of the Plays by it self, I think there is great reason in it, and do there∣fore expect it, that no Contribution should be required from St. John's towards the Plays at Christ-Church. And I pray let me have an Ac∣compt from you of the settlement of these things. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest, Croydon, July 15. 1636. Your loving Friend W. CANT, Reverendissime Cancellarie, TEnsis ad Coelum Palmis, contemplamur attoniti inexplebilem vestrum lar∣giendi Thanks from the University for setting up the Arabick Lecture. which I founded for my own time, (having not means to make it perpetual) in hope, that by Charity it may grow into perpetuity.

E Dome nostrae Congregat ionis Aug. 10, 1636. Sanctitatis vestrae humillima Cultrix, Oxon. Acad. THis year his Majesty and the Queen invited themselves to me Concerning my Entertain∣ment of the King at Oxford. to Oxford, and brought with them Charles, Prince Elector Palatine, and his Brother Prince Rupert, being both then in England. They came into Oxford at the end of this Summer's Progress on Mun∣day August 29. The Vice-Chancellour made a very good Speech unto them, where my self and the University met them, which was a mile, before they entred the Town. That Speech ended, they passed along I came into Oxford to make things ready for this entertain∣ment upon Thursday Au∣gust 25. I came in privately at Dinner hour, having sent most of my Ser∣vants thither the night be∣fore, and my self lay that night at my Ld. of Oxford's. by St. John's, where Mr. Tho. Atkinson made another Speech unto them very brief, and very much approved of by his Majesty afterwards to me. Within Christ-Church Gate, Mr. William Strode the University Orator entertained them with another Speech, which was well appro∣ved. Thence the King accompanied his Queen to her Lodging, and instantly returned, and went with all the Lords to the Cathedral. There after his Private Devotions ended, at the West Door Dr. Mor∣ris, one of the Prebendaries entertained him with another short Speech, which was well liked. And thence hisMajesty proceeded into the Quire, and heard Service. After Supper they were entertained with a Play at Christ-Church, which was very well penn'd, but yet did not take the Court so well. The next day being Tuesday, the King came to Ser∣vice August . soon after 8 in the Morning. It was at Christ-Church, and Mr. Thomas Brown being then Proctor, made an excellent Sermon, which gave great Content. The Sermon ended, The Prince Elector, and his Brother Prince Rupert, attended by many of the Lords, came to the Convocation-House, where the Place was full of University-Men, all in their Forms and Habits very orderly. And the two Princes with divers Lords, were pleased to be made Masters of Art; and the The two Prin∣ces names en∣tred in St. John's College. two Princes Names were by his Majesty's leave entred in St. John's College to do that House that Honour for my sake. In Convocation the Vice-Chancellour having first placed the Princes, and briefly exprest the cause of that Convocation, I made a short Speech, which here follows in haec verba.
Florentes Academici, & hoc tempore florentissimi quibus Caroli Regis & Pientissimi & Prudentissimi: simul{que} Mariae  Heroinae, Consortis suae charissimae, praesentiâ frui datur Nec eâ solum, sed & praesentiâ eximiae spei Principum, Nepotum M. Jacobi Sacratissimoe Memoriae Monarchae, & de Academia Literatis{que} omnibus optimè meriti; Principes hi sunt, & hoc Ti∣tulo, & suo, omni honoris genere dignissimi. Vos eos omni, quo , prosequimini. Quid expectatis ultrà, Academici? An ut ego Oraetorio in hoc Senatu fungar munere? At illud & memoria, curis simul & annis fracta, & lingua per se inculta, & desuetudine loquendi ; & praesens , quod ad alia festinat, omnino Prohibent. Nec Principes hi Preceresve illud à me expectant, Cui aliud satis jam incumbit negotium: & qui illis  in omnibus sum pollicitus. Breviter itaq: quod ad vos attinet, Principes, non Ortu magis quàm Virtutibus illustres. Non expectat à vobis Academia, ut possitis totam Entis prosunditatem exhaurire, ut sic sitis Artium Magistri, sed liceat dicere: Freta aetatis vestrae nondum transiistis. AEstus jam urgent juve∣niles. Hos discite superare fluctus, procellas has in auras redigere, & omnium insimul Artium Magistrieritis, & quid ni fortunoe? At{que} utinam nostrae potestatis esset, coecoe illi Deoe oculos dare, quibus virtutes vestras cerneret, & agnosceret jura. Et vos etiam Proceres, Principum horum Cultores, convocata hac Acade∣mia exultat videre, & non solum conferre gradus suos in vos gestit, quos omni honoris cultu veneratur: sed potiùs eos conferendo, honorem summum gradi∣bus suis quaerit; quod placeat Principibus hisce vobisq, Pannis suis (nam &  in purpura est) inaugurari. Floreat sic soepius Academia, & Nativis simul & Adoptivis Filiis gaudeat. Egregie Vice Cancellarie, ad Creatio∣nem & Admissionem simul pro Officio tuo descende. AFter this the Vice-Chancellour proceeded, made another short The 2 Princes and other Ho∣norable Per∣sons made Ma∣sters of Art. Speech, and after Creation and Admission of the Princes and and other Honourable Persons, ended the Convocation. That finisht, they all returned to Christ-Church to attend upon the King, (the Prin∣ces having formerly in the Morning seen some of the fair Colleges.) Then the Queen being not ready, the King with the Princes and the Nobles, my self also waiting upon him, went to the Library, where the King viewed the New Buildings and the Books, and was enter∣tained with a very neat Speech made by the Son of the Earl of Pembrook and Montgomery, then Lord Chamberlain. Then word was brought up, that the Queen was come. So the King went into the  to her, and they went away to St. John's to dinner, the Princes and Nobles attending them. When they were come to St. John's, they first viewed the New-Build∣ing, and that done, I attended them up the Library Stairs; where so soon as they began to ascend, the Musick began, and they had a
fine short Song fitted for them, as they ascended the Stairs. In the Library they were Welcomed to the College with a short Speech made by — — one of the Fellows. And Dinner being ready, they passed from the old into the new The King and Queen; Prince Elector, and Prince Rupert with other Ho∣norable Per∣sons feasted by me at . John's. Library, built by my self, where the King, the Queen, and the Prince Elector dined at one Table, which stood cross at the upper end. And Prince Rupert with all the Lords and Ladies present, which were very many, dined at a long Table in the same Room. All other several Tables, to the number of 13 besides these two, were disposed in several Chambers of the College, and had several Men appointed to attend them; and I thank God I had that happiness, that all things were in very good order, and that no man went out at the Gates, Courtier or other, but content; which was a Happiness quite beyond Expecta∣tion. When Dinner was ended, I attended the King and the Queen toge∣ther with the Nobles into several withdrawing Chambers, where they entertained themselves for the space of an hour. And in the mean time I caused the Windows of the Hall to be shut, the Candles lighted, and all things made ready for the Play to begin. When these things were fitted, I gave notice to the King, and the Queen, and attended them into the Hall, whither I had the happiness to bring them by a Way prepared from the President's Lodging to the Hall without any the least disturbance; And had the Hall kept as fresh and cool, that there was not any one person when the King and Queen came into it. The Princes, Nobles, and Ladies entred the same way with the King, and then presently another Door was opened below to fill the Hall with the better sort of Company, which being done, the Play was begun and Acted. The Plot was very good, and the Action. It was merry, and without offence, and so gave a great deal of content. In the middle of the Play, I ordered a short Ban∣quet for the King, the Queen, and the Lords. And the College was at that time so well furnisht, as that they did not borrow any one Actor from any College in Town. The Play ended, the King and the Queen went to Christ-Church, retired and supped privately, and about 8 a Clock, went into the Hall to see another Play, which was upon a piece of a Persian Story. It was very well penn'd and acted, and The latter Play at Christ Church acted over a∣gain by the Queen's Play∣ers at Hampton Court. the strangeness of the Persian Habits gave great Content; so that all Men came forth from it very well satisfied. And the Queen liked it so well, that she afterwards sent to me to have the Apparel sent to Hampton Court, that she might see her own Players act it over again, and see whether they could do it as well, as t'was done in the Univer∣sity. I caused the University to send both the Clothes, and the Per∣spectives of the Stage; and the Play was acted at Hampton Court in November following. And by all Men's confession the Players came short of the University Actors. Then I humbly desired of the King and the Queen, that neither the Play nor Cloathes, nor Stage might come into the Hands and use of the Common Players abroad, which was graciously granted.
But to return to Oxford. This Play being ended, all Men betook themselves to their rest, and upon Wednesday Morning August 31. about Eight of the Clock, my self with the Vice-Chancellor and the Doctors attended the coming forth of the King and Queen; and when they came, did our Duties to them. They were graciously pleased to give the University a great deal of thanks; and I for my self, and in the Name of the University, gave their Majesties all possible thanks for their great and gracious Patience and Acceptance of our Poor and mean Entertainment: So the King and the Queen went away very well pleased together. That Wednesday Night I entertained at St. John's, in the same Room where the King Dined the Day before, at the long Table, which was for the Lords, all the Heads of Colleges and Halls in the Town; and all the other Doctors, both the Proctors and some few Friends more, which I had employed in this time of Service; which gave the Uni∣versity a great deal of Content, being that which had never been done by any Chancellor before. I sat with them at Table, we were merry, and very glad that all things had so passed to the great satisfaction of the King, and the honour of that place. Upon Thursday, September, 1. I Dined privately with some few of my Friends: And after Dinner went to Cuddesden to my ancient Friend, my Lord the Bishop of Oxford's House, there I left my Stew∣ard, and some few of my Servants with him at Oxford to look to my. Plate, Linnen and other things, and to pay all Reckonings, that no Man might ask a Penny after we had left the Town; which was care∣fully done accordingly. Upon Friday, September 2. I lay at a house of Mr. Justice Jones's of Henley upon Thames, upon his earnest Invitation. And upon Saturday, September 3. (God be thanked) I returned sase home to my House at Croyden. The week after, my Steward and other Servants, which staid with him, came from Oxford to me; where the Care of my Servants, with God's Blessing upon it, was such, as that having borrowed all the King's Plate, which was in the Pro∣gress, and all my Lord Chamberlain's, and made use of all mine own, and hired some of my Gold-smith, I lost none, but only two Spoons which were of mine own Plate, and but little of my Linnen. My Retinue (being all of my own, when I went to this Enter∣tainment) were between 40 and 50 Horse; though I came private∣ly into Oxford, in regard of the nearness of the King and Queen, then at Woodstock. There was great store of Provision in all kinds sent me in towards this Entertainment; and yet (for I bare all the Charge of that Play, which was at St. John's, and suffered not that poor Col∣lege to be at a penny Loss or Charge in any thing) besides all these sendings in, the Entertainment cost me........
Salutem in Christo. SIR, THE Sickness of these Times, and my many other occasions, Novem. 26. My Letters to the Vice-chan∣cellor about the Service to be in Latin at the beginning of Terms, &c. made me forget to write to you before the beginning of Michael∣mas Term last, concerning the Sermon and Prayers usually had at St. Maries at the beginning of Terms, which were wont to be not so or∣derly as they should, nor with so good Example to other places at large in the Kingdom, as such a University should give. For, First, the Communion was Celebrated in the Body of the The Com∣munion to be Celebrated in the Chancel. Church, and not in the Chancel, which, tho' it be permitted in the Church of England in some cases of necessity, where there is a Mul∣titude of People; yet very undecent it is, and unfitting in that place, where so few, (the more the pity) use to communicate at these So∣lemn times. But this abuse I caused to be rectified in Dr. Duppa's time, and I hope neither you nor your Successors will suffer it to re∣turn again into the former Indecency. Secondly, tho' none do come to those Solemn Prayers and Sermons, but Scholars, and those too of the best Rank, yet to no small dishonour of that place, the Sermon is in Latin, and the Prayers in English: As if Latin Prayers were more unfit for a Learned Congregation, than a Latin Sermon. And the truth is, the thing is very absurd in it self, and contrary to the Directions given at the beginning of the Reformation of this Church; for in the Latin Service Books, which were first Printed in the beginning of Queen Elizabeth, there is an Express, both Direction and Charge, that notwithstanding the alter∣ing of the ordinary Form of Prayers throughout the whole Body of the Kingdom from Latin into English: Yet in the Universities such Prayers, unto which none, but they which were Learned did resort, should be in Latin. And for my part, I do much wonder, consider∣ing how Publick that Direction was, that the University at the be∣ginning of Terms should fall from this Ordinance, and so divide the Service and Sermon between Latin and English. Upon Consideration of this I acquainted His Majesty both with that Printed Direction of Queen Elizabeth, and with the Breach of it by the University at the beginning of Terms; whereupon His Ma∣jesty was pleased to give me in Charge to see this ordered, and to take a Course for a Remedy in the future, and that hereafter Service, Ser∣mon, and Communion, should be at all beginnings of Terms Uniform∣ly in Latin, since none resort to either, but such, as well understand it. These are therefore to pray and require You at some convenient Meeting of the Heads, to acquaint them with this Direction of His Majesty, and to take care, that both at the beginning of the next Term, and of all Terms following, the Service and Communion be in Latin, as well as the Sermon. And that such, as are not furnished,
may the better provide themselves of Service Books in Latin, so soon as conveniently they can, you shall do well to make it so much the sooner known to the Heads. And this I must not forget to tell you, that when I took this first into Consideration, it was thought fitting to put it into the University Statutes. But afterwards I considered, that since the Statutes were to remain to Posterity, it would lay no small Scandal upon these times, when they should see by the very Statute it self, what a stranger the University was to the Prayers of the Church in a Learned Language. And hereupon having first ac∣quainted His Majesty with this also, I thought it better to leave it out of the Statutes, and to reduce it to this privater way, which opinion of mine His Majesty was pleased graciously to Approve. Two things there are, which You and the Heads must take present The Vice∣chancellor and he that  with him at the Commu∣nion, to wear the Surplice. care for: The One is, that the Vice-chancellor, and he that helps him to execute, (whosoever he be) be in Surplices; but whether the Vice-chancellor will put on his Surplice, when he goes to the Communi∣on, or put it on at the first, and so read Service, and sit at the Ser∣mon in it, I leave to his own Judgment; but I like the latter better, and the Surplice must be under both the Habit and the Hood. The The Sing∣ing Men to answer in . Second is, that there must be care taken with the Singing Men, that they may answer the Litany and all other places of the Service, where they interpose, in Latin, which they may easily practice and be ready to perform at the beginning of the next Term; but if they cannot, the Litany must be sung, or answered by the Masters without the Or∣gan, till they can: for the main business to have all things in Latin must go on. So wishing you all Health and Happiness, and the U∣niversity that Honour, that belongs unto Her entire, I leave you to the Grace of God, and Rest I hope you take care that all Letters of My Letters to them con∣cerning busi∣ness of Impor∣tance to be Registred. mine, which concern Business of this or the like Nature, be Regi∣stred.

E Domo Convocationis Decem. 12. 1636. Vestro honori & Paternitati de∣vinctissima, Acad. Oxon. ARTICLES, Agreed upon, and Concluded the 16th.  of Agreement between the University of Oxon, and the Company of Mationers, Feb. 16. . of February, 1636. Between the Vice-chancellor, Pro∣ctors, and Heads of Houses in Oxford, and two of the Wardens, and some other of the Company of Stationers in LONDON. FIRST, the said Vice-chancellor and Heads do Covenant on their Part, that the University shall not suffer the Printers of Oxford, for Three Years next Ensuing, to Print the Latin Grammar, called Li∣lie, nor the Bible The Books are specified in the Order from the Coun∣cil to the Com∣pany of Stati∣oners., &c. Neither shall they Authorize or License any other under their Power, or by Vertue of their Privilege lately granted, to Print any of those otherwise, than as the Company of Sta∣tioners, and the Parties therein interessed shall permit.
Secondly, the said Vice-chancellor, and Heads do promise and under∣take, that an Order to this purpose reasonably agreed upon by the Council on both sides, shall be Ratified and Confirmed by Convocation under the University Seal, betwixt this present, and our Lady Day next ensuing. Thirdly, the Wardens above-named, and their Brethren of the Com∣pany do Covenant, and Grant to, and with the said Vice-chancellor, &c. That upon such an Order had, and obtained from Convocation under the Publick Seal of the University, the Company of Stationers shall under their Common Seal, firmly bind their Body and Company Year∣ly to pay 200 l. unto the said University, during the time expressed in the Order, by even and equal Portions: That is to say, 100 l. at our Lady Day, and an 100 l. at Michaelmas, beginning their first Payment at our Lady Day next. Fourthly, the Wardens above-named do undertake to obtain this Covenant likewise from their Company under Seal; That in Case the University of Cambridge, and the said Company shall agree in like manner, that the power of Printing such Books be there suspended, and that the said Company shall give a greater Sum Yearly unto the University of Cambridge in lieu thereof: That then the said Compa∣ny shall add such Sum or Sums unto the Sum formerly express'd of 200 l. as shall make the Portion or Portions of Money equal with that which is paid to Cambridge. And the said Sum well and truly paid un∣to the University of Oxon at such times by equal Portions, as are before specified. Lastly, It is intended, and the full meaning of both Parties is, that this course of suspending their Power by the University, and the Year∣ly payment of such a Sum by the Company of Stationers shall be re∣newed at the several ends of such Terms of three Years, in manner and from above specified; untill it shall be reasonably agreed on by both Par∣ties to relinquish the same. In Witness whereof the Parties above∣mentioned have interchangeably set to their Hands. Rich. Baylie, Vice-can. Oxon. Jo. Prideaux, Exon. Rector. Ro. Pincke, Cust. Coll. Novi. Phil. Parsons, Aulae Cerv. Princip. Tho. Walker, Coll. Univers. Magist. Tho. Brown, Procur. Senior.
Salutem in Christo. SIR, I Have received your Letters, by the Stationers, and with them The Copy of a part of my Letters to the  about the Sta∣tioners agree∣ment, and the reserving of the 200 l. Per Ann. for the settling of the Learned Press Feb. 24. a Copy of the Articles agreed upon between you. These Articles I can find no fault with; For certainly it will be more be∣nesicial to the University for the advance of a Learned Press to re∣ceive 200 l. a Year, than to print Grammars and Almanacks, &c. And more Honour too, when it shall appear, to what extraordinary good use you turn this Money. I have therefore directed them to my Coun∣cil to draw the Agreement upon these Articles in Form, and so to set∣tle the business; and they give good Reason why the fourth Article should be secured apart: But I like the Conclusion best of all; Name∣ly, That this Agreement may determine at the end of Three Years, if the University find it so sitting for them. For Cambridge, as I know not, what they will do in this business, so neither will I be forward to meddle with them, but leave them to use their Privilege in such sort, as themselves shall think best. True it is, that when Bishop Harsenet, one of their own, was so far from assisting, that he oppressed their Privilege, and disswaded me; yet I stuck close to them, and carryed their Business alone: Nevertheless, they shall never be able to go tell my Lord their Chancellor, that I of∣fer to force their Privilege in the least. Yet if any difference between Them and the Stationers come in publick, I shall moderate things ac∣cording to reason, as far as I can. Now in the mean time I shall require this of you, and your Succes∣sors, that this Money, which you yearly receive, may be kept safe, as a stock apart, and put to no other use, than the settling of a Learn∣ed Press; and I think it were not amiss, that some handsome Register-Book were bought, in which might be kept alone your Acts concern∣ing the Settlement of the Press aforesaid, and in another part of the Book all your Receipts, and all your Disbursements: And if you and the Heads like this Proposal of mine, I would then have you order it so by an Act of Convocation: And I will presently acquaint the King, what great good use we are like to make of the gracious Privilege he hath granted, least any other Man should tell him, we have basely sold it. Now to your other Letters. And first I pray, use any fit means The Doctors made at his Majesties late being at Ox∣ford either to pay 20 l. a Man, or to do their Exercise. And this to be Published in Convocation. by Letters or otherwise to send to the Doctors, that took their Degree at his Majesty's late being in Oxford, that each of them repair to the University, and perform their Exercise before the Act next ensuing, or pay their 20 l. a Man, according as was ordered at the time of their Presentation. I would likewise, you would let them know, that this 20 l. a Man shall be turn'd to no other use, than to the setting up of the Learned Press, that as many of them as mean well may be the for∣warder
to pay it. And further, I think it were not amiss to Publish this in Convocation, both that it may be known to what use I mean to put the Money, and withal, that their Friends may take notice, and send them word, if they will, that I am resolved so soon as the Act is over, to sue every Man in the Vice-chancellor's Court, that pays not his Money, if he have not done his Exercise, which I will most cer∣tainly do, without respect of Persons: And therefore it is fit, it should be made known as soon as may be. I pray the next Monday commend me to the Heads, and let them About . know, that I expect from them all, that their several Companies fre∣quent the Schools diligently, and behave themselves there orderly and peaceably; and I expect from your self and the Proctors, that the Schools be carefully look'd unto, and that the Disputations be quick and Scho∣lar-like, but not tumultuous: Your Predecessor kept them in very good order both his Years, and I hope you will not fall short; And I pray tell Proctor Brown, that whatever his brother Proctor do, I ex∣pect service from him. But my main Business of all is to put you in mind, that I have not Concerning the strict ob∣servation  the new . receved any account from you all this Year, how the new Statutes are put in Execution, and that not only for matter of Disputations, but for all things else: And the reason of this my Care to have an Account, is two-fold. First, If the Statutes fall into a neglect, and an half Performance now at their beginning, and in my own life-time, there will be no hope that ever they will recover it after; and so all that great and most useful Labour for the University will be lost: And I have all the reason in the world to prevent this inconvenience if I can. And these two Years of your Vice-chancellorship, the observation, or the not observation of them therein will be a great help or hindrance to the Statutes for ever. Therefore I pray, as ever I shall intreat any thing of you, take all the care you can in this great business, and give me an Account from time to time how it proceeds: And you shall do well to send for Doctor Turner, and desire him in my name to give you all the assistance he can, and you may shew if you will, how zea∣lously I have written to you about this Business. Secondly, Because I remember I have heard, that the former Pro∣ctors distasted something about the alteration of the Statute for Readers, and that since that time there hath been a transmission of that Distem∣per from Proctor to Proctor, which must needs do a great deal of harm, considering, how much they must be trusted with the Execu∣tion of the Statutes: Therefore I pray deal seriously with both the Proctors, but especially with Proctor Brown, and let him know, that he can give me no Content, if for the remainder of his time he be not careful of the Statutes, and their due performance. And at Easter, when the new Procters are chosen, I must desire you to look to them, if they do not look carefully to the Duty of their places, and in this particular especially. Besides, I hear a whispering from thence, that
during your short abode at Sarum in this Term-time, the Schools were scarce ever called so much as once. I pray God it may be found they have called the Schools at all since the Publication of the new Statutes. You shall do well to examin this, and by the answer which the Pro∣ctors give you, you will be able to discover something both of their di∣ligence and intentions; besides, it cannot be, but that Mr. Belle's death and a new and unexperienced Successor must needs give some hin∣drance to the Statutes which pertain to Service: But I hope this will be but a temporary inconvenience, and soon blown over by the dili∣gence of Mr. Gayton, and tell him I expect it. Besides, you shall do well to have a care of Noctivagation, and o∣ther A care to be had of Nocti∣vagation, &c. disorders, else you will quickly have the Distempers of the Night break out in the Day; and now the Spring comes on, if your self do not take some pains that way, I doubt the Proctors will be negligent enough, though of their negligence I can give no reason, unless it be because by the new Statutes the University is made half sharer in the Mulcts, which how small they are, will appear by their accounts. With a special Caution for the observation of the Statute for speak∣ing Speaking of Latin urged. Latin. Lambeth, Feb. 24. 1636/7. W. Cant. SIR, I Had almost forgotten a business to you of greater consequence To Dr. Pri∣deaux concern∣ing his review of Mr. Chil∣lingworths Answer, &c. March 3. than this, and I cannot well tell whether Mr. Vice-chancellor hath acquainted you with it or no; for I writ not unto him very expresly in the business, but now recalling it, I thought fit to write thus much to your self. You know, that Mr. Chillingworth is answering of a Book, that much concerns the Church of England; and I am very sorry, that the young Man hath given cause, why a more watchful eye should be held over him and his Writings. But since it is so, I would willingly desire this favour from you in the Church's Name, that you would be at the pains to read over this Tract, and see that it be put home in all Points against the Church of Rome, as the Cause requires. And I am confident Mr. Chillingworth will not be against your altering of any thing, that shall be found reasonable. And to the end, that all things may go on to the Honour of the Church of England, I have de∣sired Dr. Potter, (who is particularly concern'd in this business) so soon Books Li∣censed to the Press to have a form of Ap∣probation an∣nexed. as ever he is returned from London, to speak with you about it. And when all these Tryals are over, I would be content, that both this Book, and all others that shall be hereafter licensed in the University, have such an Imprimatur of the Licencer before it, as we use here above, which I shall leave to the Wisdom of the Vice-chancellor and the Heads. Lambeth, March, 3. 1636/7 W. Cant.
A Passage out of a Letter of the Vice∣chancellor's. THE University do now generally resent, that your Grace ob∣tained, The Bene∣fit from the Charter of Printing, and the Agree∣ment with the Stationers up∣on it, turned to the Learn∣ed Press. April. 10. and the King confirmed unto us the greatest Benefit that ever came to the Publick; and, God willing, no Man shall di∣sturb it, while I sit Vice-chancellor. My Answer to it. IT is a hard thing in this Age, to bring Men to understand the good that is done them; and therefore I am the more glad, that the University doth it, that so great a Benefit given them by such a King, may not only be received, but acknowledged by them, and the  Mr. , Coll. Oriel. Mr. Glisson, Coll. Trin. Memory of it delivered to Succession: And I shall hope that your Successors after you will keep it in that way, into which it is now put, unless they can find a better and more useful for the Learned Press. April 10. 1637. W. Cant. Mr. Vice-chancellor, THERE was an English Translation of a Book of Devotion, Concerning the calling in of the last En∣glish Transla∣tion of Bishop Sales his Book of Devotion. May 5. Written by Sales Bishop of Geneva, and Entitl'd, Praxis Spi∣ritualis sive Introductio ad vitam devotam, Licensed by Dr. Haywood, then my Chaplain, about the latter end of November last; but before it passed his hands, he first struck out divers things, wherein it varied from the Doctrin of our Church, and so passed it. But by the Pra∣ctice of one Burrowes (who is now found to be a Roman-Catholick) those Passages struck out by Dr. Haywood, were interlined afterwards, (as appears upon Examination before Mr. Attorney-General, and by the Manuscript Copy) and were printed according to Burrows's Falsifica∣tions. The Book being thus Printed, gave great and just offence, e∣specially to my self, who upon the first hearing of it, gave present Or∣der to Seize upon all the Copies, and to Burn them publickly in Smith∣field. Eleven or Twelve Hundred Copies were Seized and Burnt ac∣cordingly; buut it seems Two or Three Hundred of the Impression were dispersed before the Seizure. Now my desire is, that if any Co∣pies of this Translation be, or shall be sent to Oxford, you would call them in, and take such Order for the Suppressing of them there, as is here already taken. And so I commend you to God's Grace, and rest Lambeth, May 4. 1637. Your Loving Friend W. Cant.
SIR, YOU are now upon a very good way toward the setting up of Mar, 5. A Branch of my Letters to the  concern∣ing the Matri∣ces, Letters, and Composer for the  ss. a Learned Press; and I like your Proposal well to keep your Matrices, and your Letters, you have gotten, safe, and in the mean time to provide all other necessaries, that so you may be ready for that work: For since it hath pleased God so to bless me, as that I have procured you both Privilege and means for that work, I should be ve∣ry glad to see it begun in my own Life-time, if it raight be. And be∣cause the beginning of such a work will be very difficult, as also the procuring of a sussicient Composer, and Corrector for the Eastern Lan∣guages, you have done exceeding well to think of him at Leyden, and to get him over upon as good Terms as you can, and to give him an Annual Pension in the mean time, that he may not be tempted from your Service. So God speed you. I have sent you down by this Carrier my Book of the University My Book of  sent for the Library  to see their Daties. Statutes, which I give that the Library-keepers may read their own Duties in it; for having none, I doubt they keep neither old Statutes nor new, so well as they should. And it may be, if you and the rest of the Curators would look well to it, you might find many things there, out of order, and sit to be amended. And while I am upon this Argument of placing the Statute-Book in the publick Library, I pray acquaint the Heads at the next meeting, that I am informed, that the Concerning the keeping  the Statutes too close. Statute-Book in some private Colleges is kept up too close from them, whom it concerns; which is a great hindrance to the due Publication of the Statutes, and ministers occasion to many Men to pretend Igno∣rance, instead of shewing Obedience. I pray therefore commend my love to the Heads, and let them know, that I expect every Head of College and Hall, where there is a Library, to take care that the Book of Statutes be placed and chain'd in it, that it may be of free access to the Students in each Society; And that in such Halls, as have no Li∣brary, the Statute-Book be placed as safely, and yet as publickly as it can be. And further, I must and do require of every of the Heads, Additions to be inserted in∣the Statute∣book of every Col. and Hall. that all the Additions and Alterations made upon the Review of the Sta∣tutes be put into all and every Statute-Book which is kept within their several Governments. And I do require of you, Mr. Vice-chancellor, to see it done, and to give me an account of it. For it will be no great Labour to you at some convenient times to send for the Statute-Book of every College and Hall, and see whether it be done or no; and if the Additions should not be writ into every Book, it would cause one Col∣lege to be otherwise informed concerning their particular Statutes than others are, and so cause more frequent recourse to the Leidger-Book, than would otherwise be necessary, and perhaps breed other disseren∣ces also. I find that the Proctors of the last Year, and I doubt their Prede∣cessors Concerning the Proctors collecting the Mulcts. also, have been too negligent in Collecting the Mulcts; and it may be those that are new come in, will be negligent also, if you call not upon them betimes; I pray therefore commend me to them and
tell them, that I will expect their Performance in this particular, as well as their diligence in all things else; and that I hold it a very un∣worthy thing that out of a plausible popular humour to decline the En∣vy of any private Man, they should so far neglect their Duty to the Statutes and the Publick. And certainly if the Proctors go on in this way, and either wholly neglect it, or thrust it upon the Vice-chancellor, I shall not only take it very ill from them; but at the end of their Year, either I shall cause the Delegates not to pass their Accompts, till they have paid it themselves, or else sue both them and the Delinquents in the Vice-chancellor's Court for such Mulcts as are left by them uncol∣lected. And I pray let the Heads know, what I have Written in this Particular also. I have some more Manuscripts almost ready for you, but I would . willingly have some larger place made, and assign'd for them, either in the old Library, or in the new Additions to it; for I saw the last Summer, that the place, where they now are, would not hold all which I have sent already. And the sooner this place is provided, the better, for to prevent Casualties; I could be content, they were out of my Hands. Lambeth, May 5. 1637. W. Cant. SIR, I Would have you send for Mr. Brevin, and let him know not only A Branch of a Letter to the  concern∣ing Mr.  his Degree of Master, May 19. the difference of a Master of Art at Oxford and Samure, but the ill consequences also, which may follow upon it, in case he should have his Degree confirmed; and that I advise him to go the other way, and to stay half a Year, and so to be created Master, and that in the mean time I will speak with his Friends here: but certainly for ought appears to me yet, or is like to appear, I will never give way to the confirming of his Degree, things being at Samure, as you have report∣ed them. I like your Proposal very well for Mr. Cartwright, and am glad to  Mr. . hear that he is so Passing sit for the Greek, and every way else so well deserving for this or a better Place. I have not leisure to write a Let∣ter to the Heads, which may lie Leidger against that time; but I am very heartily willing to give my consent, that when the Voydance shall come, Mr. Cartwright may be the Successor, and to that end I give you free and full Power to move the Heads, or to do any other Act fitting, or conducent to the good success of this business. And so much I pray let Mr. Cartwright know, and withal give him thanks for his fair and respe∣ctive Letter to me. One thing is considerable, I take it, the Statute re∣quires that somewhat should be done with the Bedel of Law in relati∣on to the Learned Press; but my Memory does not hold it perfectly,
what it is; And therefore you shall do well to consider it. And now upon a suddain considering Gaytons sufficiency, tis come into my head to ask this Question! Why may not all three Esq Bedels joyn in the Learned Press, tho' perhaps but one of them need be the chief Manager: For ought I know, this may be very well worth your considering. I am very desirous to prevent Perjury by all means possible, and So much of the Statutes, as con cern manners or ex∣ercise, to be contracted in∣to a little Vo∣lume, and Printed for the Use of the Younger . therefore if you can tell how to order it, that so much of the Statute Book may be Printed; as may direct the younger sort in matter of Manners and Exercise: You shall do very well to take it into full Con∣sideration with the Heads; and then put it in practise accordingly. But I would have the Collection made to be Printed in a little Vo∣lume for the daily use of the Students that may desire it. In your last Passage, I think you are mistaken; for certainly the great Leidger-Book of the Statutes is to be placed in Archivis among the University Charters; and not in any Cubb of the Library, nor to be come at The  Book of Sta∣tutes to be  in . without more  than one: And for this (as I remember) there is a particular Statute. But howsoever, I will not have that Book trusted under any Library-Keeper's Key, and for the Statute-Book, which I sent down; You did well to leave it in the Cubbs, where it must re∣main, unless you can sind some other way to prevent the endeavour of the Dutch to transcribe it. Lambeth, May 19 1637. W. Cant. SIR, I Am very glad I put that to the question, concerning the joyning Part of a Letter to the Vice-chancellor concerning the ; Bedells, their assistance at the learned Press May 26. of the other two Bedells with the Law Bedel to assist at the Learn∣ed Press, considering that it jumps so well with your Care and Thoughts in the same kind: And yet, tho' I think their assistance may be very useful to that Work, it will certainly be necessary, that the Statute be observed, and the main Trust be lest upon the Law Bedel. For else you know between many Stools, what's like to go to Ground. But in∣deed if the University would set sadly to it, and bring in some Bat∣chelors of Art to be Yeomen-Bedels, which are well grounded and to∣wardly To bring in some Batche∣lors of Art to be Yeomen-Bedels to serve the Press. to serve that Press, as Composers, or otherwise it would in time be of excellent use. And they, which thrived well and did good service, might after be preferred to be Esq Bedels, and so that Press would ever train up able men for it self. And tho' there be time enough to think of this Business; yet certainly it would not be amiss, now while 'tis res integra, to Propose it (in general at least) to the Heads, that every man may have his eyes upon, and help to per∣fect so good a Business which yet I leave to your free Consideration.
I am glad the Divinity Disputations in course go on. I hope now Divinity Dis∣putations. that's master'd, other difficulties will be put the better over. But in any Case give continual Charge concerning the speaking of Latin. For Speaking of Latin urged a∣gain. if that be not followed, it will be a heavy business to many of the Younger sort, when they come to take their Degrees; and the time of four Years for the putting of that Statute in execution will draw on apace. When I read your Letters I was doubtful, in whom the Gift of The Clerk∣ship of St. Ma∣ry's and the be stowing of it. the Clerk-ship of St. Mary's was, till after considering how the Fees did rise, I conclude it must needs be in the University. And while I was reading your Letters, I did think to leave it wholly to your self, for which of your Men you pleased; but afterwards reading a Letter that came from Dr. Turner, he put some thoughts into my Head, that such a man might be chosen Clerk, as may be servicable to the Lear∣ned Press, either as a Founder of Letters, or as a Press-man in some inferiour Service. This is a very good consideration and timely put in; I pray therefore speak with Dr. Turner about it, and if such a man may be had in any Case, let him be chosen: But if otherwise it happen, that you must take a man at large, then I leave you free to take, which of your own men you please. Yet whosoever you make Clerk, I hold it very sit that the same man that is Clerk, may The Clerk of St. Mary's not to be Clock-keeper. not have the keeping of the Clock at St. Mary's to shorten Hours at his Pleasure, especially in Lent, to the great hindrance of those dis∣putations, and the disordering of the University in all Exercises. But I think very fit, that some honest man were taken into that service, that would not be so easily found, nor perhaps so ordinarily corrupted, as the Clerks use to be. And for this service of his, he may be allowed some small thing Yearly out of the Clerk's wages. I leave all this to your Consideration, but believe it as very a Trisle as it seems, it reaches very far into the Discipline of the University. May, 26. W. Cant. SIR, I Am very sorry you are to seek for men to answer in the Law A  to the Vice∣chancellor con∣cerning An∣swerers in the  and Phi∣sick Act. June 16. and Physick Act; and am very loth to give way to any, that want time to answer, and have that Exercise, stand for their Degree. Were it not better, that one of the Doctors should answer the rest, than to take his course? truely for my part I think it more honour for the University to have no proceeders in in either Faculty, than to be driven to this Exigent. And it were fit hereafter, you did a∣gree The procee∣ders in either Faculty topro∣vide his An∣swererhimself with the Doctors, that proceed to provide an Answerer, and not leave the University to provide one for them, and not to suffer the
Degree of any one Doctor to pass, till he were able to name, who should answer in that Faculty. I pray consider seriously of this with the Heads. Lambeth, June 16. 1637. W. Cant. SIR, FOR Mr. Crofts and his great Horses, he may carry them back A Passage of a Letter to the Vice-chan∣cellor for Mr. Crofts and his great Horses to depart Ox∣ford. if he please, as he brought them. For certainly it cannot be fit for the University, tho' the exercise in it self be exceeding commenda∣ble: For the Gentlemen there are most part too Young, and not strong enough; besides you cannot put that charge upon their Parents, with∣out their particular leave and directions; but this especially is consi∣derable, that where ever this Place of riding shall be, where one Scholar learns, you shall have 20 or 40 to look on, and there lose their time, so that upon the whole matter, that place shall be suller of Scho∣lars, than either Schools or Library. Therefore I pray give Mr. Crofts thanks fairly for his good intentions; but as thus advised, I cannot give way to his staying there to the purpose he intends; nor is it al∣together inconsiderable, that you shall suffer Scholars to fall into the old humour of going up and down in Boots and Spurs, and then have their excuse ready, that they are going to the Riding-house; and I Hereupon Mr. Crofts present∣ly left Oxsord. doubt not, but other inconveniences may be thought on, therefore I pray no admittance of him.

The time draws now on Dr. Baylie continued Vice∣chancellor a se∣cond Year. for the appointing another Vice-chancellor for the Year ensuing, that so the Government of that place may go orderly and peaceably on, as (God be thanked) it hath hitherto done. But when I consi∣der with what temper and moderation Dr. Baylie, Dean of Salisbury, hath carried himself in all Businesses, which went through his hands
in the Year past, and particularly in the manageing of the many and great businesses, which happened at his Majesties late being there, and what content he hath given the University; I am resolved according to the course, which I have usually held, to continue him Vice∣chancellor for the Year following. And tho' the trouble be great, which accompanys the due execution of that place; Yet I hope the for∣mer years experience, will make this ensueing Year seem less Burden∣some to him, and this my new choice of him which I now make, very welcome both to himself and you. These are therefore to pray and require You to allow of this my choice of Dr. Baylie, and to give him your best assistance in all such things as shall concern the Honour and good Government of that Uni∣versity, which not doubting but every of you will do, I leave you all to God's blessed Protection, and rest Lambeth, June, 30. 1637 Your very loving Friend and Chancellor, W. Cant. To my loving Friends the Vice-chancellor, the Doctors, the Proctors, and the rest of the Convocation of the Uni∣versity of Oxford. FOR your Act, Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites! In To the Vice∣chancellor con∣cerning the Act in the dan∣gerous time of infection June 30. plain English, keep an Act or keep none! Take it quite away, or defer it, do what you will, but I will not lye open to the Censure, that may pass upon it, either for the present omission, or for the con∣sequences of infection, which may follow upon it. You are many and wise, and upon the place, and therefore to your selves I leave it, with this caution, that at the first if you keep not the Act at the time, deferring will seem less to the World, than cutting off; but in the end it must come to the same thing, for I presume you will not keep a Winter Act: And for any thing that concerns your self in particu∣lar, that's not a matter considerable, for 'tis but a little Pains lost; and not so much, if you can tell how to lay a Speech in Pickle till the next Year.

SIR, I Understand, that Richard Bull one of the Yeomen Bedels is lately My Letters to the Vice∣chancelor in the behalf of William Ball for a Yeoman Bedel's Place.

And yet truely, tho' I leave all men that have suffrages free, I cannot but marvel, that there should not be a full concurrence of Voices for the choice of Wil∣liam Ball, Servant to your late Predecessor Dr. Puike. For to my know∣ledge he took a great deal of very good Pains in writing out the Leidger-Book of Statutes for the University. In which respect I for my part cannot but recommend him to the care both of the Heads and of the Masters assuring my self, that he will be a very serviceable man in that place, both for his Pen and otherwise, and therefore I do hereby pray you to do him the best Offices you can, that he may be He had the Place. chosen. So I leave you to God's blessed Protection, and rest Croydon July 14 1637. Your very loving Friend, VV. Cant. SIR, MR. Greaves of C.C.C. began to read the Arabick Lecture upon Wed∣nesday Mr. Greaves Deputy Ara∣bick-Reader. in Mr. Pocock's absence. 19 July? as Deputy to Mr. Pocock, to whom I gave leave to Travel to Constantinople and the Eastern parts for the better per∣fecting himself in the Arabick and Eastern Languages, and I allowed him the stipend of the Lecture towards his Travels. Concerning Mr. Brown and your Stationers, there is little more to A Passage of a Letter to the Vice-chan∣cellor concern∣ing Mr. Brown and the Statio∣ners July 28. be said. For the truth is, since Mr. Brown, buying at the first hand may sell as cheap as the Merchant, he will certainly draw all the Cu∣stom of the whole Town to himself. And certain it is, this would be a considerable benefit to the particular Students who are to buy; but it must be the utter undoing of all the other Booksellers about the Town, which again on the other side is more considerable, and that as well in regard of the Honour and Justice of the University, as of the Livelyhood of the men themselves and their Families. The truth is for ought as yet appears to me, Mr. Brown must not be suf∣fered to sell by retail for the reason aforesaid. And you were as good order it so your selves, as have it ordered above to your Hands; for I remember some two years since, there was a great Complaint brought to the Councel-Table, that some men in London would be both Mer∣chants of Cloth, and yet keep a Drapers-shop, and sell by retail; and it was over-ruled at the Board that they might use which they would
but that they might not use both. And I verily believe, if your Sta∣tioners complain thither, (as fear of undoing may make them do any thing) I shall be commanded to Order you in this Case of Mr. Brown after the same manner. Besides this, there is something considerable in the thing it self. For tho' it be true, that Mr. Brown in this way may, and no doubt will undersel your other Stationers, and so undo them, and enrich himself; Yet when they are all undone, may not he then, or any other, that shall succeed him in that way, raise the price of Books, under some pretence or other, and sell them as dear as the Sta∣tioners now do? It is therefore certainly a business of great Conside∣ration in it self, and in the Justice of the University, that so many Men and Families be not ruined, after they have served there for their Free∣dom, and Liberty for some Saving to particular Men. And for an Ex∣pedient in a middle way, I do not yet see, where it may be had; and certainly one way or other, the business must be settled, and the soon∣er the better. Croyden, July 28. 1637. W. Cant. Most Reverend Father in God, my very Honourable good Lord! I Had long since in my former Letters acquainted your Grace, accor∣ding Dr. Fell's Letter to me concerning the too great Number of Victualling-Houses in Ox∣ford. to your directions, with the particular mischief, that ariseth out of the multitude of Victualling-Houses in this place, but that I was informed that by your Grace's care, an Order was made, that no Ju∣stices should License Ale-Houses, but in open Sessions, and that the Num∣ber should not exceed Three and Twenty. But finding, that this ex∣cellent remedy taketh no good effect, I am once more bold to be trou∣blesome to your Grace, hoping, that by your Assistance and Favour, which is never wanting to us, we may in some measure amongst our selves correct this spreading evil. I know your Grace is very appre∣hensive of the Malignity of this desperate evil, the occasion of many's ruine amongst us, the Number of Victuallers being incredible, and like∣ly to grow continually. The Cure (I conceive) is not by punishing the immediate Delinquents, either by Imprisonment, according to the Statute 5 to Edw. 6. or by whipping by the Statute Primo Reg. Caroli, but (as I have learned by serving two Apprentiships) by Indicting the Brewer upon the Statute 4 to. Reg. Jacobi, who must pay 6 s. 8 d. for every Barrel he shall deliver into any Tap-House not Licenced. These Men are Solvendi, and if the Penalty be required, they will be soon weary of trading this way; and by this means, we stop the Current at the very Head and Fountain. I hope the Justices in the Town-Sessions will not hinder this good work, they having much encreased the
Number of the Burghers by renewing very lately their Commission, wherein Five of them are added, One being a Brewer, who neither by Law, or in Reason, should be a Judge in this kind, &c. At this time Dr. Fell sent me a List of Ale-Houses  in , 94. 94 Ale-Houses, which were un∣licenced within the City of Ox∣ford. Christ-Church, Oxford, August 15. 1637. Your Graces ever to be commanded in any service for the good of Church, or State Sam. Fell. Salutem in Christo. SIR, I Received your Letter concerning the great number and increase August 26. My  to Dr. , Letter con∣cerning a Number of Ale-Hoases unlicenced in Oxford. of Ale-house-keepers and Victuallers unlicenced in the University to the great dishonour of that place, and as great mischief to many young Students there. I thank you heartily for this care and pains, and do hereby assure you, that I will give you all the assistance I possibly can to cure this Malady: And if you find that neither the Order which I caused to be made, nor the other Remedies, which your self mention, will cure this business (as it seems to do) I pray acquaint Mr. Vice∣chancellor with these my Letters, and let him know, I would have him, your self, and the other Justices, to proceed upon the Statute 4 to. Jacobi, and make every Brewer pay 6 s. 8 d. for every Barrel he shall deliver into any Tap-house not Licenced. It seems by your Letter, that this Statute well followed, is a pro∣bable Remedy, and indeed I think it will go far, if it be well follow∣ed. I perceive, you have but one doubt against it; and that is, least you should find opposition from the Town-Justices, who (you say) have of late both renewed and enlarged their Commission by the Ad∣dition of Five, one of them being a Brewer. Will the University still sleep, while the Town slips these things upon them? I am sure, I once took order, that the Number of Town-Justices should not exceed those of the Vniversity, that so things might be carried with indifferency. And if they shall now oppose in this business of the Ale-houses, it will be a good occasion for me to move My Lord Keeper again to dissolve their Commission, which I will not fail to do, if they give me cause: So I pray proceed, and God's Blessing be upon your Endeavours, while I rest I trouble you with these Letters, because Mr. Vice∣chancellor was newly gone away from me with a whole Bundle of Instructions, just as your Letter came to me. W. . Croydon, August 26. 1637. Your very loving Friend W. Cant.
SIR, THough unknown, I have presumed to be so bold, as to solicite Letters from Oxford to Mr. Fish of Clarken∣well to convey two Youths be∣yond Sea. you in a Business, viz. to know, whether you could send over one or two, who for Religion sake, are desirous to be entered into some Order beyond the Seas, especially that of the Fratrum Minorum, or Je∣suites. So expecting your Answer, and unwilling to disclose my self, till I have it, I rest Mr. Fish brought me this Letter August 29. 1637. Direct your Answer as soon as you can, to one Richard Pully in St. John's College in Oxon. Yours, August 23. Superscribed thus: To his very Loving Friend, Mr. John Fish in Clarkenwell give These. Leave this at one Mr. Fish's at Doctors-Commons, to be delivered unto him. LONDON. Salutem in Christo. SIR, I Have yet received no Letter from you this Week, if I do, you My Letters to the Vice∣chancellor (Au∣gust 29. 1637.) sent presently away, for care to be had of this Business. shall have an Answer on Friday, if I have so much leisure. In the mean time I send you this inclosed, which came to my Hands this present Afternoon; I pray examine the business with all the Care and Industry you possibly can, as well for the discharge of your own Duty and Credit, as mine, in the Government of that place. And if there be such a Man as Pully here mentioned, be sure to make him fast, and examine him throughly touching all Particulars, that you shall think material for the Discovery of these unworthy Practices for the seducing of Youths in that University, or elsewhere, especially concerning the Author of this Letter, and what Youths have been dealt withal after this sort, either in that House or any other of the Town. And whe∣ther any Jesuits, or others, have lain hankering up and down there∣abouts, or be there at this present to that purpose, or any other as bad. In all which, I desire you to use the utmost diligence and discretion that you can, and let me have an Account with all convenient speed. So I leave you to God's Grace, and rest This falls out very unhappily, not only for the thing it self, which ought by all means to be prevented; but also for the Clamors, which the late Libellers have made, that there are great endeavours for reintroducing of Popery. Croydon, August 29. 1637. Your very loving Friend W. Cant.
SIR, I Am glad you found all in Health, and all things else so well at September, 1. 1637. A Pas∣sage of a Let∣ter to the Vice∣chancellor con∣cerning Mr. Greenwood of Brazen-nose, and the for∣met business concerning the Letter sent to Mr. Fish. your return; and yet I cannot but see, that both Factions would be busie there. Concerning the Popish Faction, I writ hastily to you to prevent a Danger, which I thought was Imminent, and God grant you may secure it! but in any case name not Fish, if you can possibly avoid it; but carry it as if the Letter were Intercepted, and be as care∣ful, as possibly you can. And concerning the Puritan, I see plainly, that Brazen-Nose hath some as bad, or worse than Cook was about four Years since. And that Greenwood, who Preach'd on Sunday last, is like to prove a peevish Man, which I am the more sorry for; because you write he is a good Master of his Pen, and therefore like to do the more harm. But since he hath so cunningly carried it, (for the Fashion is now to turn the Libellous part into a Prayer) I think the best way is to take no notice of it at all; but the more carefully to observe, what the Man doth in the University: For I would have no Man publickly call'd in Question, where a fair Answer may be given and taken, that the Peace both of the Church, and of that place may be preserved, as much as may be. And yet to confess my thoughts to you, I think Mr. Greenwood had in this business, a very Factious, and a Rancorous mean∣ing. When you have made all the use you can of the Let∣ter I sent you on Wednesday, take a Copy of it, and send me back the Original safe. September 1. 1637. W. Cant. SIR, UPon the receipt of your Grace's Letters on Wednesday, I instantly An Account from the Vice∣chancellor a∣bout the busi∣ness concern∣ing Pullin of St. Johns, Re∣ceived Sept. 5. in answer to my Letters on the Wednesday before. set a Spy upon Pullin, one of our Scholars of the House of two Years standing, sent to the Carrier for a view of all the Letters sent to St. Johns; none were directed to Pullin either on Thursday or Saturday: Neither did Pullin on Thursday, or ever since look towards the Carrier. On Friday morning, I took him coming from Prayers in the Quadran∣gle, where I might see how he behaved himself at Citation. I instant∣ly searched his Pockets, took his Keys of Study and Trunk from him, searched them (he staying in my Lodging) I looked over every Book and Paper; I found nothing that might give the least suspicion that he is inclined towards Popery. I examined his Chamber-fellows, what Company resorted to him; They protested they never saw any, be∣sides those of our own House, one or other to come unto him. I re∣turned to him, demanded what acquaintance he had in Town; he professed he knew none but one Isam of Christ-Church, who went Six
Weeks hence to his Friends in Ireland, and him he knew at Westmin∣ster-School, I cannot learn that Isam is inclined that way. I further questioned, whether he ever received Letters for any other since his coming to us; he vowed no, I shewed him the Letter directed to Fish, enquired whether he knew the Man or the Hand-writing, he vow∣ed no. Divers other Interrogatories I put him, but could not gather either from the matter or manner of his Answer the least ground of suspicion. I have diligently enquired of others, who might know I left him to the Vice∣chancellors dis∣posal, but withal to look well to him, and what Let∣ters came to him. him, but have not for which I might suspect him. Under charge he is, not to stir out of the College, nor to speak with any Stranger with∣out my leave upon pain of Expulsion, and thus he shall rest till your Grace shall free him. September, 4. 1637. SIR, SInce the finishing of your new Library will cost you a Thousand To the Vice∣chancellor con∣cerning the Addition to the new Li∣brary, Sept. 8. Pounds, I am heartily glad you have Seven Hundred Pounds in Chest towards it. I pray therefore acquaint the Heads, that I would have this work presently begun, (especially considering how long it will be in doing) that so the Learned Press may really and heartily be set upon; which I do desire to see on foot. The Act, that was put off from the usual time to the The Act ta∣ken away by reason of the Sickness. 7th. of October, was on Saturday the 9th. of Sep∣tember quite taken away from this Year, by rea∣son of the unreasonableness of the time, and the danger of the Sickness spread about the Country. Croyden, Sept. 8. 1637. W. Cant. SIR, YOU cannot carry too careful an Eye, either over Pullin or the To the Vice∣chancellor, Sept. 15. concern∣ing Knot's ha∣ving Mr. Chil∣lingworth's Book from the Press, sheet by sheet. rest; for certainly some are about that place to seduce as many as they can. And particularly Dr. Potter writes me word, that Knott is now in Oxford, (I would you could lay hold of him) and hath the Sheets from the Press, as they are done; and that he pays Five Shil∣lings for every Sheet, and that you are acquainted with this Rumor. I pray be very careful in this also, for I know the Jesuits are very cun∣ning at these tricks; but if you have no more hold of your Printers, than that the Press must lye thus open to their Corruption, I shall take a Sowrer Course, than perhaps is expected. For tho' perhaps they
go so cunningly to Work, as that I shall not be able to make a legal Proof of this soul Misdemeanour: Yet I find that Knott makes a more speedy Answer, than is otherwise possible, without such seeing of the Sheets, I shall take that for Proof enough, and proceed to Discommission your Printer, and suppress his Press. And I pray fail not to let him know so much from me. Croyden, Sept. 15 1637. VV. Cant. SIR, I Have received the Paper of Mr. Chillingworth's Reasons, why he A Passage of my Letters to the Vice-chan∣cellor Sept. 22. about Mr. Chillingworth's answering the second Part of Knott's Book. is so loath to meddle with the second part of Knott's Book, think∣ing the Answer to the first sufficient; and truely were all men that shall come to read his Book of his sufficiency, I would be of his Opi∣nion, especially supposing, that to be true which he gives for one of his reasons, namely, that there is nothing in the Second of any worth or moment, that is not a repetition of somewhat in the First. Upon all things laid together, I am somewhat divided in my thoughts, what to resolve in this business; yet thus far I dare resolve. First, I would not have the Answer farther delay'd which Mr. Chillingworth says he must needs do, and that for some Months, if he Answer the second Part. Secondly, If he Answer the first only, I would have him Print at the end of it those Reasons, which are fit to be publick why he does not Answer the second Part, and especially that Reason which he expresses, namely that the second Part contains almost nothing, but repetitions of the former. Thirdly, In the An∣swer of the first Part, I would quote to a Page where the same is re∣peated in the second Part, that so the World may take notice, that both Parts are answered in one. And Lastly, I would have him ac∣quaint Dr. Potter with as much, as may any way be fit, that so no dis∣content may arise between them. Croyden Sept. 22. 1637 W. Cant. SIR, DR. Fell is now with me, and returns to Oxford in the beginning of Letters to Dr. Shelden a∣bout Dr. Fell's resignation of the Marg. Lecture, and Dr. Lawrence succeeding him Novemb. 3. 1637. the next week. At his return, I would have you or Mr. Vice∣chancellor speak with him about his Resignation, which he hath promi∣sed me to make, both of his Lecture and Prebend of Worcester; and that so soon as their Worcester Audit is over, (which I take is this November) he having this Year an Office in that Church to be accountable
for. And when you have once spoken with him about it, You may then go on, and make the Business as sure as you can. When all is done, you must deal with Dr. Laurence to be very mindful of the waspishness of these times, and to be sure to read upon no argument, that may make any the least trouble in Church or Uni∣versity, which I shall in part lay upon your Care to look to; for so much as concerns Dr. Lawrence, so wishing you all health, &c. Lambeth, Nov. 3. 1637. Your very loving Friend, W. Cant.

College, and as glad that he wants but a quarter of a Year of full time to be Master of Art. I pray perswade with the Young man to stay, and then give him his Degree with as much Honour, as you please. And you may tell Dr.  the jealousies, which I have a∣gainst the making of a Precedent in the other way by incorporation, as the Case stands. And tho' the Marginal Statute indulge to the King's Subjects in his own Universities, yet that is nothing to Samure. Samure. And therefore certainly I shall not like that which is desired. I know nothing in the Statutes, that exempts a Pro-proctor from any Concerning the Care of the Proproctors and Masters of Schools for Exercise in Divinity. Exercise which lies upon him in the University, or a Master of the Schools from Exercise in Divinity. Therefore let Mr. Duncombe do his Exercise in God's name, for I will have no such precedent begun either against or without Statute; neither am I well pleased, that able men should be so willing to seek all occasions to shift off Exercise in Divinity.

The Title of the Book is, Statuta  è Corpore Statutorum Vniversitatis Oxoniensis, ut in promptu & ad manum sint, quae magis ad usum (praecipuè Juniorum) facere videntur. SIR, For Mr. Chudley, in the sense which I writ, and as you took it, To the Vice∣chancellor , Mr. Chudley's Dis∣pensation for a term to be made Master. the Example will be so full of danger, and the breach of Statute so vi∣olent against it, with a Nullo modo proponatur, & ne quisquam proponat sub poenà Banniconis, as that for my part, I shall never yield to it for him or any other. And therefore you did well, before you proposed any thing to the Heads, to acquaint me with those Barrs in Statute, and with the danger of the Consequence likely to fall very often in every Year wanting one Term, and no more. But in the end of your Letters, you tell me that young Chudley came to you, and exprest him∣self otherwise; namely for a present Creation. And this way (you say) expresses more present savour and respect to him, and is of less danger in the precedent for the future. The young Man ( seems) deserves
well, and the Princes Tutor hath been very earnest with me for him, Nevertheless I shall not in this way peremptorily appoint any thing, but leave him to you and the Heads to do whatsoever you shall think fittest; and with advice, rather to shew no favour, than to creat a Pre∣cedent, which may endanger the Statutes and the Government after. Of which I shall ever desire you to be tender and careful. Lambeth, Feb. 9. . W. Cant. A Strict Charge given to the Vice-chancellor and Proctors, to look . that the Lent Disputations be carefully performed, in a quick and Learned way, and without disorder. Lambeth, Feb. 12. . W. Cant. MR. Kilby of Lincoln-College made a Sermon, in which he brake Mr. Kilby censured for breach of the Five Articles, Feb. 12. . his Majesty's Declaration concerning the Five Articles; but he submitted himself, and his Censure stands upon Record. The Ser∣mon was Preach'd upon Tuesday the 30th. of January, and he was cen∣sured Feb. 12th. 1637/8. The Students of Christ-Church and Exeter, grew so unruly the last Out of a Let∣ter of the Vice∣chancellor, con∣cerning some disorders be∣tween Christ-Church and Exeter Coll. Men in the Schools in the second Week of  this Year . week, (the Masters interposing and wrangling in the Schools, and their Boys fighting out of School,) that I was forced to Command an absolute Cessation of all manner of Disputations betwixt the two Houses; and so they rest quiet ever since. Most Reverend! WE are Encouraged in the common favour, respectively vouch∣safed Letters from the University for the taking down of the Conduit at Car∣fax for a . by your Grace unto the University and City of Oxon, to present our common Grievances, and to appeal unto your Grace for a Redress, wherein we shall most willingly rest and settle. The Jurors consisting of Twelve Privileged, and Twelve Free men Empanell'd by the University to enquire after such Misdemeanours as are impleadable in a Court-Leet lately held in your Grace's Name, have presented with joynt Consent unto your Vice-chancellor the Conduit  in the Market-place at Carfax, as a Nuisance.
The Vice-chancellor (as opportunity was ministred) gave notice here∣of unto the Heads at their Monday Meeting, and assumed to deliver as much unto Mr. Mayor, adding his Request, that it might duly be con∣sidered, what was best to be resolved in this kind. We, whose names are here underwritten, have diliberated upon the Presentment, do freely assent to the Body thereof, and acknowledge the Conduit there placed to be a just Grievance. The Remedy is not so easily prescribed; neither should we happily so jointly concur in the amends, if we undertook to determine the same. Our Appeal unto your Grace is unanimous, both University and City, submitting our Accomodations unto your Grace's Resolution, most humbly beseeching your Grace to take this particular into Con∣sideration, and so to order the same, and dispose of it for the Good and Honour of the University and City, as you in your Wisdom shall think fittest. And what your Grace doth herein determine and pre∣scribe, we readily embrace: And by our best Endeavours (God wil∣ling) will promote the same; So taking humblest leave, we conti∣nue (justly bound) to pray for your Grace's Prosperity.

Martij ult. 1638. W. Cant. IN a Convocation on Wednesday, April 4. Mr. Masters was restor∣ed . Masters and  Re∣stored. to the University, who was banish'd thence in the Year 1632. for abusing some of the Heads the Year before in his Speech, as being then Terrae Filius. Mr. Wallup was likewise restored to his Degree of Master, who was degraded Ann. 1637. for his neglect of appearing at the Act kept on the 6th. and 7th. of October, by reason of the Sick∣ness that Year in divers places. I am glad, You and the Heads are sensible of the weakness of the Two Passa∣ges of my Let∣ter to the Vice∣chancellor, A∣pril 13. about strengthening the Schools. Schools in the point of their Timber, and certainly Dr. Hawley's Me∣mory will suffer in it, who was trusted with that Work. I am of O∣pinion (for ought appears to me yet) that no other way but Posts will secure the business, and there must be two Posts in every School, where there are more than one Beam. I know there are other devices which Carpenters may mention: But they are to me as great Eye-sores, as a Post can be, and yet will not secure the Work, for neither clamping with Iron, nor Bracers from the Wall to the Beams, or two half Posts close to each Wall, can secure the middle of the Beam, where the greatest weakness is, and whence the Danger will come. I am very glad to hear so well of the young Monk, that was; and About Mar∣tin Wescombe to be Master this next All. I pray let him have his Degree to be Master with all favour: For I do not see any inconveniency possible, by allowing any Man that time for his Degree, which he hath studiously spent in any other University. So let him be Master this Act, and God bless him. Lambeth, April 13. 1638. W. Cant. THis Week notice was given me of some Disorders of the Youn∣ger Notice of some disor∣ders of the Youth this Week against the Proctor with my An∣swer.  Mr.  of  Coll. Mr.  of . Coll. sort against Proctor Lawford (at the end of his Speech when he was to lay down his Office) in affronting him in the Convocation-House, and Stamping and Hissing him at St. Maries; and I returned the Vice-chancellor this Answer: That he should do well to vindicate the Proctor with severity. And if he could find the Principal Ring∣leader, to Banish him the University, and put some severe Punish∣ment upon the rest. In which if he did fail, we should have the
Youth break out oft into these Insolencies. And the Proctors dis∣heartned to do the Duties of their Places. April 13. W. Cant. SIR, YOur Judgment hath passed very right upon the Principal of April 27. 1638. Concerning Gilpin's Ex∣pulsion from Magdalen Hall. Magdalen Hall and Gilpin. And I plainly see, the business must be divided between them; and that Division I leave to you to make: Yet with this Caution that you suffer no man to escape unpunish't, for Incivility and Disrespect to his Governors; if the Complaint be justly made to You, and your assistance called for according to Statute. And on the other side, you shall do well to make the Precise part under∣stand (as you have occasion to deal with them) that they are not Pu∣nish't for their Conscience, But because they will never reform an erroneous Conscience, nor forbear Practising according to it, and that to the disturbance of Government. So the whole re-examination and future Settlement of that business I leave wholly to you. I thank you heartily for your discreet Prosecution of that Base Rio∣tous Concerning the Riotous Disorder a∣gainst Proctor Lawford. Business, when the Proctor gave over his Office, and am very sorry the Heads are so Ill advised, as to think the whipping of two or three Boys, is Punishment sharp enough for such an Offence. What you will do, I know not: But if I should come to the knowledge of the Principal Offenders, if you did not Banish them the University, I should try how far my Power would stretch. The truth is, if ex∣emplary Punishment be not laid upon some of them, it will be of more dangerous Consequence, than for ought I see, the Wisest of your Heads think on. Lambeth, April 27. 1638. W. Cant. SIR, I Did not settle the assembling of the Heads upon Mundays to the May 4. My dislike of the Punish∣ment resolved on by the Heads, for the late Disorder. end my Vice-chancellor should ask their leave, or be over-ruled by their advice for the Punishing of a Crime so Notorious and Pub∣lick as this Tumultuous Carriage at the late Resigning of the Proctor's Office was, and to deal freely with you, I am no way satisfied either with the Heads or Your self in this business: Not with the Heads,
because if they would not yield to Bannition, yet they should have or∣dered Upon this the  in his  May 7. . that he could not make full  against any, else he would have been more Se∣vere. it to publick Punishment; the Crime being so publick as it was. And the shame of a publick Punishment, would have wrought more both upon the Persons, and for the Example, than greater Smart in a private way. Besides I am sure enough that they, which have so un∣worthily smother'd this Punishment, will not be over severe in their Private Execution. Neither am I satisfied with You: For when you saw in what a disproportionable way to the Crime the Heads inclined to go, You should have told them plainly, and have performed it, That you would not yield to any such ending of the Business, till I were made acquainted with it, and had approved it, which I should never have done, but have brought the Offenders to some publick Shame or other. And indeed I am not a little troubled at this breach upon Government; which I ever perswaded my self, you would not have suffered. And I have much ado to hold my self from calling this Business to a more Publick reckoning, but that the disgrace both of the Heads and You must attend it. And I pray, let them know, how sensible I am of this great disservice to the University Government. Lambeth, May 4. 1638. W. Cant. SIR, FOR the business concerning Shurley, I have both thought upon May .  Cafe in Resi∣ding in the University, and having two  with Cure. it, and advised with others, and am clearly of Opinion, that the Statute, which gives leave to a Man's stay in the University, that is under 40 Years of age, doth not priviledge a Man that hath a Vi∣carage, and is sworn to Residence unless he be dispensed with∣all for Residence according to Law. But in Cafe of two Be∣nefices and one of them a Vicarage, and both with Cure, which is Shurley's Case, I think the Statute hath no meaning that a Man shall live absent from both under any University-Pretence whatsoever. And I believe, should the words of the Statute be doubtful, no man would inter∣pret them with such Prejudice against the Church. You shall therefore He hath o∣beyed and is  to  upon one of his . in God's name send Shurley home and not suffer him to live there, either to be so great a Scandal to the Church abroad or to give such an Ill Example in the University. And this I assure you, and so you shall let him know from me, That if he do not repair to his Resi∣dence, being call'd thereto by his Bishop, I will expel him the Uni∣versity; and then let him seek his Remedy by Statute, if he can: And I'le be as good as my word. And I do hereby require you to give me an Account how this business proceeds from time to time. Lambeth May Vlt. 1638. W. Cant.
SIR, I Pray instantly call a Congregation, and change the first Question An  &  in li∣turgia  â justam  Scandali Materiam? of the three appointed for the Act. They which proposed it to you, were inconsiderate bold Young Men. And so I pass them over for busie Fools, which can think there can be nothing in the State, but by and by it must be made an Act-question. And for your self, I do much wonder, where your Judgment was, when you could let pass such a Question, and not only in your Private Thoughts, but in Congregation, and that without consulting me about it. And this I'le tell you, I know divers in Oxford are discontented with it already, and they have reason: And so there's Justa Scandali Materia in taking the Question. And every Man sends his Friend up a Copy to London, and that I know will make a Noise here; And I make no doubt but it will come to the King's ears before Sunday that I can come to him. And tho' you do change the Question (as I command you to do presently) Yet there will not be wanting, which will say, That you would never have proposed this without me; and that certainly I com∣manded it to see how it would take. And that if it had taken well, it should have gone on: But that now I see it otherwise, I am content to disclaim it. In short, if the worst Enemy I have in the King∣dom had studied to do me a shrewd turn, they could not (as the times are) have found out a way more cunningly to have wounded me, than this, and I did not think it possible till now I see it, that you could have been so overseen in this business, as you are in proposing this Hereupon the Respoa∣dent and  were changed  upon the Receipt of these Let∣ters. Question in the Congregation, Me inconsulto. There's now no reme∣dy; but to call a Congregation, and change the Question which I once more require you to do presently. Lambeth June 7. 1638. W. Cant. SIR, FOR the main business of an Act or no Act, it seems you are re∣solv'd The Sup∣pressing of the Act or  it only, left to the choice of the Heads. upon the Negative; and I find you have considered the great Difficulty which attends this Resolution, and which lyes between the matter of Credit and Safety. 'Tis true, no Act, and you hazard your Reputation very far; and so much the more, because you have missed two Years together alrea∣dy. And 'tis as true, that so many places about you being infected, and that Cambrige men may flock thither, (tho' that place be touched) You have great reason to think of your safety; but for my own part I shall do as I did the last Year, that is, leave you to your own Judg∣ments, and prescribe nothing either for or against; With this, that I would have you remember, that the last Year the Act being put off very late, you lost your Reputation, and the Town was as full of
Strangers, as tho' an Act had been kept, and consequently the Dan∣ger The Sick∣ness encrea∣sing in all these neighbouring Parts the Act was supprest in Convocati∣tion on Thurs∣day the 28th of June, 1638. as great, but that it pleased God to bless you. And if it should happen now that the Act should be put off, and the Company come notwithstanding, and fill the Town, and (which God forbid) any danger follow, you will then incurr the Danger and lose the Credit. I write this only to put you in mind, how the Case stands, but will not command any alteration of that, which You and the Heads being up∣on the place shall think fittest for your selves and it. Word is now sent me that the New Con∣vocation house is finished. Croyden, June 25. 1638. W. Cant. After my hearty Commendations, &c. THE time puts me in mind of nameing unto you a new Vice∣chancellor. Dr. Frewen chosen my Vice∣chancellor. For the Dean of Sarum, Dr. Baylie, hath now undergone the pains and Care of that Place two Years together; and I shall not hold it fit without greater necessity, than I hope can befall me there, to over-burthen any man with more than two Years toge∣ther in that carefull and troublesome Office. Dr. Baylie for his time hath been very carefull to give both my self and You, as much satisfaction and content, as well may be expected in the Execution of such an Office: And hath taken a great deal of Pains to uphold the discipline, and increase the Stock of the University. So that he hath left a good example to his Successor in both kinds. And now I have made choice of Dr. Frewen, Dean of Gloucester, and President of Magdalen College to suc∣ceed him; who as he is every way very able and sufficient for the dis∣charge of that Place: So hath he this great advantage, that he hath been Vice-chancellor heretofore, tho' under another Chancellor of the University, and by that means is well acquainted with all those things, which are incident to the Office: And thereby will be easily able to master those things which would be difficult to another man's begin∣nings. And this falls out so much the better, because at Michaelmas, that great and beneficial Statute (give me leave to call it so) concer∣ning the Examination of those, that stand for Degrees, must begin to be put in Execution. And tho' I do not hear, that the Younger sort have been so careful to provide themselves by speaking Latin in their se∣veral Colleges, as I was to give them warning that they might; yet that shall put no stop upon me, but that I shall expect and require the Execution of the Statute.
These are therefore to let You know, that I do hereby nominate and choose Dr. Frewen to be my Vice-chancellor for the Year en∣sueing, and to pray and require You to allow of this my Choice, and to give him all the Respects due to his Place, and all other. Aid and Assistance by your Counsel or otherwise, which shall be requi∣site, the better to inable him in the discharge of the Office, which he now undertakes. Thus not doubting of your readiness, and willing obedience herein; I leave both him and you all to the Blessing of God, and rest, July 11. 1638. Your loving Friend, and Chancellor W. Cant. To my very loving Friends the Vice-chancellor, the Do∣ctors, the Proctors and the rest of the Convocation of the Vniversity of Oxford. I Have now no Business to you but only to pray you, that in this Aug. 3. 1638. To the Vice∣chancellor to look to Scho∣lars, for Ta∣verns, &c. Dead time of Vacation, You will be watchful that the Scholars spend not their time in Taverns and Ale-houses, and so help themselves to put on a Habit, which will not be fit to be worn in Term, nor at any other time. And you cannot do a greater Office in all the time of your Vice-chancellorship, than to hinder the growth of this Spread∣ing Evil, &c. Croyden, August 3. 1638. W. Cant. SIR, I Thank You heartily for your Care about the Taverns and the Aug. 10. For Care about Ale∣houses. frequenting of Ale-Houses, about which base places You cannot be too careful. For they are certainly the Bane of a great many young Men, which are sent to the Vniversity for better Purposes; and if you do not now and then give them a Night walk, they will easi∣ly deceive all your Care for the Day. To look to the Scholars at his Maje∣sty's coming to Woodstock by reason of my Absence, which was ne∣ver before since I was Chancellor. I Cannot be at Woodstock this Year when His Majesty comes, by reason of Business which the King himself hath laid upon me, and must be done at that time, or not at all. I am sorry it so falls out, but I have spoken with his Majesty, that my Absence may not hin∣der the wonted Grace which he shews to the Vniversity. I have likewise spoken to the Officers of the Houshold about Your Enter∣tainment
that Day. I have also sent to My Lord of Oxford to attend there in my Room. It will be time for you now at your Monday Meeting, to propose to the Heads the keeping of their several Com∣panies at Home, that they may not disturb the King's Game, nor otherwise offend the Court by their frequent going thither; of which I pray be very careful. Croyden, August 10. 1638. W. Cant. SIR, I Thank You for your Care to make a present stop of the use of pro∣hibited Aug. 17.1638. To the Vice∣chancellor a∣bout Gowns. The fault appeared to be the Tay∣lors only, and so I gave or∣der for Pun∣ishment. Gowns among the younger sort. But if you punish on∣ly the Taylors that made them, and not the Scholars that wear them, I doubt You will not easily remedy the Abuse, unless it appear to You, That the Taylors made them without the Scholars Appoint∣ment; then indeed the Scholars are Blameless, otherwise not. Croyden, August 17. 1638. W. Cant. IN this time of my Absence from Woodstock, things were carryed From the Vice-chancellor, Aug. 27.1638. well at Court by the Heads; and they had a very Gracious En∣tertainment there, and gave the King good Content, and were dis∣missed without Complaint against any Scholar for disturbing his Ma∣jesty's Game. SIR, FOR the Business concerning the placing of the Sons of the Lady To the Vice-chancellor, Sept. 20. con∣cerning the placing at St. Maries, the Sons of Earl's Daughters marryed to Knights. Lewis with the young Noble-men; I am sorry that they which are Suitors, have so much as one Precedent for it. But since 'tis so, I am glad that was before my time; for certainly I am not like to make a Second. And I pray do you consider what it may breed in the Issue, If all the Children of Noble-men's Daughters that are Marryed to Knights, shall challenge the same Privilege in the Vni∣versity, that the Sons of the Noble-men do, and with what Power and Discretion the University can give it, considering they have not the Privileges with Noble-men's Sons in any other part of the King∣dom besides, nor can you at present see what Constructions may be made of it above, it being upon the matter the giving of a Preceden∣cy. The Truth is, I would be very glad it were in my Power to gratifie that Honourable Lady without prejudice to the University, which I doubt in this Particular cannot be. And besides, I am per∣swaded this proceeds from the forwardness of Dr. Mansel and her Kinsman, Dr. Glenham, and not from her self; tho' if it did come
from her self, I cannot tell what other Answer to give; therefore I pray give them the fairest Denial you can. Croyden, Sept. 20. 1638. W. Cant. WHereas there is an Omission in the Statutes concerning the Ex∣amination Passages out of the Vice-chancel∣lor's Letters, with Answers to them. 1. Concer∣ning Exami∣nations in Term time. It needs not; the one being in Sta∣tute, the o∣ther being by Statute put into the Hands of the Proctors. 2. Concer∣ning Proctor Corbet of Mer∣ton-College, about his as∣sisting at the Communion at the begin∣ing of Term. of the younger sort before they take their Degrees, I advised the Vice-chancellor to consult the Heads for a supply of this defect in Statute, who did so, and sent me word that the Heads had Ordered, That all Regents should examine in their Course, those only excepted, who are dispensed with for their Absence by the Con∣gregation; and that every Candidate repulsed as insufficient by Ex∣aminers, should not be admitted to a second Examination in six Months after. To this I gave Answer, That they should do well in a Business of such Difficulty, and so unpleasing to the young Stu∣dents, and perhaps to the Regents also, to have this their Order con∣firmed in Convocation, unless they did find any thing in Statute to make such Order of their binding. To the Proctor of Merton-College, Mr. Corbet, I delivered your Grace's Advice, That he should do well to substitute some other to officiate for him at the Communion at the beginning of Terms, if the tenderness of his Conscience would not give him leave to conform to such seemly Gestures, as are thought fit to be used at that Service: His Answer was, That he did conform therein at the last Commu∣nion; the which, how true, my Predecessor now with your Grace, is best able to resolve you. I found him (I confess) more tractable than I expected; but since that time he is quite relapsed (the Fruit of his Friend's, Mr. Channell's Sermon, wherein among other the like passages he told us: That he that does more than Canon requires, is as great a Puritan, as he that does less.) By his last Discourse, I find him resolved neither to conform nor absent himself without Command, which I have assured him already is folly to expect. Yet to this pur∣pose, he desired me to send you this inclosed Petition; a Copy where∣of here follows, To the Right Reverend Father in God, William, by the Divine Providence, Lord Arch-Bishop of Canter∣bury; his Grace, the Honourable Chancellor of the Vniversity of Oxford. The Humble Petition of Edward Corbet, Proctor Corbet's Peti∣tion. one of the Proctors of the same Vni∣versity. WHereas your Petitioner was wish'd by Mr. Vice-chancellor in your Grace's Name, either to bow towards the Altar at the University Common Prayers, or to forbear to officiate. He humbly
sheweth your Grace, that from his Heart he Loveth and Honour∣eth the Church of England, and doth not only rigidly and carefully observe her Doctrine and Discipline, but would to the utmost of his weak power defend the same with his Pen or Blood. And there∣fore he humbly beseecheth your Grace, that if above and besides what is established, any thing be thought fit to be practis'd, your Grace would vouchsafe either to order and command him to do it, or else be pleased to leave him to that Liberty which our Religious King and Orthodox Church have allowed him, so should he pray for your long Life and happy Government in the Church. And to all this I gave the Vice-chancellor this Answer following. I Thank you for your discreet handling of Proctor Corbet. And first for the thing it self; I have received his Petition, and will not give him any Command, either to do, or desist, or to appoint a∣ny Substitute, but leave him, and let him do as it shall please God and himself. And secondly, for the manner of this his Refusal, I must tell you, that it is all one in substance, with the Petition which Mr. Channell himself delivered me about a Twelve Month since; and that since your late being with me, I have received an Answer Notwith∣standing this to your ; you shall give the Proctor no Answer at all from me. not much in effect differing from this Petition, from two or three Refractories in different Parts; and now your Predecessor tells me, that he being lately in his Visitation of his Peculiars belonging to his Deanery, had the same Answer given him, That they looked for a Command. By all which put together, I see the Faction have in∣formed themselves, and are agreed to make this Answer, To call for a Command, which from me they shall never have, till I may be warranted my self by publick Authority: But we find, that besides Articles and Canons and Rubricks, &c. the Church of Christ had ever certain Customs which prevailed in her Practice, and had no Canon for them; and if all such may be kickt out, you may bid farewel to all Decency and Order. In the mean time I will acquaint His Majesty with this Distemper growing, that the Blame may not be cast upon me. THere is an Abuse hath continued long, and is, I think, very fit . Every  to have a distinct Bell tolled to his Lecture. to be Remedied. It is, that when divers publick Lectures are at the same Hour in the University, One Bell (if I mistake not) hath been used to toll to all of them, by which means the Auditors to all Lectures take occasion to repair to the Schools, and when they come there, perhaps but one Lecturer reads, and then they cannot find their way back to their several Colleges, but spend their time as they should not. To prevent this, I pray communicate with the Heads, and make an Order, That a distinct Bell be tolled to every Lecture, that so the Auditors may know for what Lecture it is, and This is since ordered by the Heads and settled. apply themselves accordingly. And I think 'tis very fit, that the Professor intending to Read that Day, should give warning to the Clark for the tolling of his Bell. Lambeth, October 5. 1638. W. Cant.
ON Wednesday the 10th. of October, the Vice-chancellor and the The New Convocation-House in use. Octob. 10. Vniversity entred upon the use of their New Convocation-House, without any other Solemnity, than a solemn Speech of Bene∣from the Vice-chancellor. On the same Day the Examinations of  for Degrees be∣gan Examinati∣on for De∣grees. to be put in Execution according to the Statutes. WHen the Proctor saw that your Grace would not command Out of the Vice-chancel∣lor's Letter, Octob. 15.The Man∣ner of Proct∣or , Conformity.  Conformity in Gesture at the beginning of Term, he re∣quested me to require it; (pretending that my Predecessor had done so before me,) I refusing, he then proffered to conform of his own ac∣cord, but he either did it not at all, or did it so poorly, that it was scarce observable by them that were present. The Vice-chancellor could not observe it, by reason of his Officiating at the Communion: Howso∣ever this is gained upon him; That either he did conform and can∣not deny it to the Faction; Or else, that he is a gross Dissembler to the Vice-chancellor and the Authority born there. SIR, I AM informed by the Dean of Christ-Church of a shameful Non-Residence To the Vice-chancellor, Octob. 18. to send away Mr. Little and Mr. Verier to reside upon their several Benefices. practised by two Christ-Church Men, under the pretence of University Privilege; whereas such a foul Abuse is no way to be endured; one of them is Mr. Vereir, he had a Living given him by the University in Worceslershire 12 Years since. And he hath ever since (as I am informed) lived in the University, and spent that sa∣cred Revenue most prophanely. The other is one Mr. Little, and he hath had two Vicarages in Yorkshire these 7 Years, and hath per∣formed no Church-Duty upon either of them, but only that he makes a merry Journey once a Year into those Parts, and then returns again, and wastes the rest of his time in Oxford under pretence of Suits. It was time to take this , for the Vice-chan∣cellor sent me word, Octob. 22. that there is much de∣claiming at St. Maries a∣gainst Non-Presidents in general. Of which these give too just Cause. But it is no way probable, that both these Vicarages should be litigious 7 Years together. And howsoever, it will be a great Scandal and Dishonour to the University to have such shameful things as these countenanced under the Name of Privilege. I have written to the Dean to lead the way to you, and expel them out of Christ-Church if they have any Footing there; and therefore I do hereby Pray and Require You to proceed to Bannition against them in the University, if they do not presently repair to their Livings and reside there; of which I shall expect an Account from you. And hereupon I writ to my Lords of York and Worcester, to call these two Men to reside upon their several Benefices. The like Course shall you take with one Woodruff; I shall speak Woodruff's Non-Resist∣ence. first with Dr. Baylie about him, for the Monition was given him in his time. Lambeth, Octob. 18. 1638. W. Cant.
SIR, I Have written to my Lords, the Arch-bishop of York and Bi∣shop To the Vice-chancellor, Octob. 31. My Resolution a∣bout Non-Re∣sidents in ge∣neral. of Worcester to call Vereir and Little to Residence; and if the one have prevented that Call, and the other mean to do it, 'tis well. For I am resolved (and so you may signifie to the Heads at your next Meeting)  purge the University of all Non-Residents, which have not express Letter of Statute to relieve them, and bind my hands. And as for the Statute of the Realm, which had a great deal of Reason, upon which to ground it self, when 'twas made; but (God be thanked) by the Learnedness of the Age, hath little now; as I may not violate it, so neither will I suffer unworthy preten∣ces to abuse both the Church and it, if it lye in my Power to apply a Remedy to so gross an Abuse. And I pray, let the Heads know, that I would not have endured so gross Non-Residence (as I find Mr. Vereir and Mr. Little guilty of) to shelter it self in that University, had I sooner known of it, than now I came to do by a mere Acci∣dent. Lambeth, Octob. 31. 1638. W. Cant. SIR, IN this Case of Non-Residence, I pray require all the Heads of A Note to be brought in of all the Be∣neficed Men in every Col∣lege and Hall. Which was done accor∣dingly. Colleges and Halls to bring you in a Note of all Beneficed Men, which live under their Government: At what distance their Benefice is from the University, the value in the King's Books, and otherwise, (if they can learn it) how long they have held it. Lambeth, Novemb. 2. 1638. W. Cant. COncerning the Incorporation of the Guernsey Man mention'd, The Guern∣sey Man's In∣corporation. pag. 210. there hath at his humble Suit been a new Considerati∣on taken by the Vice-chancellor and the Heads for the Statutableness thereof. And it was found upon this Review, that the Statutes consi∣der'd two sorts of Men; The first are such as never have been Mem∣bers of our University or Cambridge. Of these treat the Statutes, the first, de Incorporatione, and seem to distinguish them into Aliens and Natives: The second sort are such as have been Students sometime in either of the Universities. As for the Natives (in which Number the Guernsey Man is) the Words of the Statutes are, — Quibus incorpo∣rari permittitur, Si tempore in Academiâ suâ requisitò, & praestitis prius Exercitiis, gradus susceperint. Upon which Words the Question was whether a Native having taken a Degree in a Foreign University, might call that Academiam suam, which is resolved by the use of the same Word, Suos twice in the same Paragraph, where it stands in∣definitely for any University, where either Foreigner or Native hath taken his Degree. As in this Form, — Vt admitatur ad eundem Gra∣dum,
&c. quibus ornatus est apud Suos. Whereupon it was judged by the Heads, that there was no Bar in Statute to exclude the Guernsey Man (he producing first Letters Testimonial of the University, where he proceeded, That he had spent as much time in his Studies there, as is required by the Orders of that University, and that he had per∣formed his Exercise) from the Benefit of Incorporation. Upon the same Ground, way was given for the Incorporation of one of the Sons of Sir Henry Vane, Comptroller of his Majestie's Mr. Vane incorporated Master. Houshold. To the most Reverend Father in God, the Lord Arch-bishop of Canterbury, Chancellor of the Vniversity of Oxford. The Humble Petition of the Inhabitants of Milton, Hasley, Petsworth, Lewk∣nor, A Petition against the  of Oxford for spoyling the High-ways by their too great Carria∣ges. &c. Humbly sheweth, THat the Petitioners have bestowed great Costs and Charges in repairing their High-ways, through their several Parishes, leading from the University of Oxford towards London; That the Car∣ryers of Oxford do carry such unreasonable Carriages, viz. sometimes 40, 50, or 60 Tun at a Load, by which means they do spoil the High-ways, that notwithstanding the Petitioners great and extraor∣dinary Charge in continual repairing of them, the ways are made al∣most unpassable. The Petitioners most humbly beseech your Grace to give Order that the said Carryers of Oxford may be restrained to such certain stint and reasonable weight of Carriages, especially in the Winter-time and foul Weather, as in your Grace's Wisdom shall seem , for the good of Travellers in the High-way, and ease of your Petitioners. And they (as in Duty,) &c. Upon this Petition, for redress of this Abuse, I writ to the Vice∣chancellor. SIR, I Here inclosed send you a Petition delivered this Week unto me, My Answer for redress of this abuse, directed to the Vice-chan cellor. concerning the High-ways towards London, and beyond our own Liberties. I have been the only Man that have kept up the Carryer to his four-wheeled Carriage for the University sake; but if this Pe∣tition be true, it will force me to take off my Hand, and then I know he must take off two of his Wheels; and that done, let him carry what Weight he can. I pray You and the Heads to take this into serious Consideration, and to think upon some Remedy. That which I ever thought on was not to go by the weight of his Carriage, for then he will be continually laying on more, and you are not able to watch him, but by the number of his Horses, which should not exceed five or six at most; and then himself will not dare to lay on more load
than his Horses can well draw through those bad ways; and if the Carriages be so great that he must use more Horses, let him use a second Cart, and divide his Team. If you can think upon a better way than this, I shall be glad of it, but You must prudently think upon some way for Remedy; for if it come to publick scanning at the Council-Table, or the Assizes, it will be ordered, whether you will or no, and perhaps in a sourer way, and not so agreeable to your Liberties, as this way it may be done. Lambeth, Nov. 23. 1638. W. Cant. I See good effects already of that Statute, which hath been most Out of Dr. Turner's Let∣ter to me (of Merton-Col∣lege) of the good Success of the new Statute, de Examinandis Candidat sent about  time. cryed down by those from whom I least expected it, the Statute de Examinandis Candidatis, and promise my self much more hereafter. I was present at one Examination, and was glad to hear both the Regents examine so sufficiently and discreetly, and the Candidates so ably and readily. I cannot believe that the ablest Proceeders in for∣mer times, if they had been examined upon the sudden, could have acquitted themselves better than these Candidates (such as I stum∣bled on by chance) did upon expectation of a certain unavoidable Examination. The moderation which your Grace prescribed to Mr. Vice-chancellor in the Execution of this Statute, hath set it very well on Foot, which if it had been pursued roughly at the beginning, would never have held, or else would have bred great Distempers in the University. For the Regents (who at the beginning of Term) kept out of the way, insomuch, that the Proctor of thirty of the Ju∣nior Regents could scarce meet with three Examiners, if they had been held up stiffly at first to the rigour of the Statute, and so infor∣ced some of them to lay open their own Infirmities or Disabilities, they would either have absented themselves quite, or else have made some desperate violent opposition against the Statute, and the Authori∣ty that should back it. But by this Moderation which Mr. Vice∣chancellor The Care and Modera∣tion of the Vice-chancellor herein. useth towards them, (conniving at some defects now and then, where they come short of the Statute) he hath won the Re∣gents so, as that they conform themselves in a good measure to the intent of the Statute. For they examine through all the Arts and Sciences, in which the Candidates are bound to have been Auditors, asking fundamental Questions in every one, not propounding studied Subtilties to gravel and discourage young Students. And when the Statute hath gotten head, (which many Men had fore-doomed, and therefore did not fit themselves for it against it should take place,) I doubt not but the Regents will rise to a higher pitch, and the Candidates likewise will come prepared for it. But that which will set a special Edge upon both, is Mr. Vice-chancellor's assiduous Pre∣sence at their Examinations, which I must confess looking to his for∣mer Solitude and Retiredness, I could never have expected from him.
There was Complaint made to me by his Majesty, of the great No more than 15 Doct∣ors to at∣tend His Ma∣jesty at Wood∣stock. number of Doctors, that usually resorted to Woodstock at his being there; whereupon to prevent this Abuse for the Future, I writ to the Vice-chancellor that they should lessen their Number, which was done accordingly; and in their Monday Meeting, on the 17th. of De∣cember, an Order was made by the Heads, That the number of Doct∣ors designed to attend His Majesty at Woodstock should not exceed Fifteen: That they should all go in wide sleeved Scarlet Gowns, (not in Habit and Hood) save only the Preacher, who during his Sermon should wear his Hood also; And further, That both the Proctors should go in their wide-sleeved Gowns too. And that it might the better appear what Doctors should go, It was likewise Ordered, That this Number should always a little before every His Majestie's resort to that Place, be chosen out of the Company of the Doctors there for the performance of that Service. Trusty and Well-beloved, &c. The King's Letters to Christ-Church for suppres∣sing their Westminster Supper, dated about the 20. of December. WE are informed that you have for some Years suffered a very ill Custom to continue in that our Collegiate Church; for whereas there are divers Scholars chosen to be Students of that House, and divers others, that live there as Commoners, but the greatest part of the Scholars are chosen from our School at Westminster; there is a Supper maintained Yearly, commonly called a Westminster Supper, at which all and only Westminster Scholars do meet. This Supper we hold to be a very ill Custom, and no way fit to be continued: For first, it is a thing not allowable in Government, that any party of Men should have a several Meeting, which is a direct way to Facti∣on and Combination, and it teacheth the rest of the Students in such a Society to bandy themselves together against the other, that they may not be thought to be neglected. Secondly, such a Meeting must needs cause more Expences than many Students are able to bear, es∣pecially in such chargeable times as these are. Thirdly, it gives an occasion of much Drinking and Riot, and consequently of all the bad effects which follow such excesses; besides no small disorder in leaving or keeping open the Gates of the College, for ingress and egress, for resort to that disorderly Meeting, at later Hours than are fit. And most usually to add to all this Disorder, this Supper must be kept upon a Friday-Night, against both the Canons of the Church and Laws of the Realm, and to the great Scandal of all sober Men that hear of it. These are therefore to Will and Require You, the Dean and Chap∣ter, to suppress that Supper or Meeting, by what Name soever it be called; and to call the Students together, and to command them in Our Name, that they presume not at any time hereafter to resort to∣gether to any such Meeting, either in the College or out of it; and to Register these our Letters among the Orders and Decrees for the Government of that Church, as You and every of You will answer it at your utmost Perils; and these our Letters We Will shall be bin∣ding, not only upon your Selves, but upon your Successors, that this ill and dangerous Custom may never rise up into Practice again, Given &c.
I Thank you heartily for calling for Arms of your Privileged Men, Out of my Letters to the Vice-chancellor for Privileged Men to pro∣vide Arms, January, 17th. and I pray be careful that they be ordered to the full as high as any Towns-Men of their Rank and Condition; and so they that love neither you nor your Liberties may not be able to take any Advan∣tage against you, either in regard of the Number, or the sufficiency of the Arms. And I pray see that this be done with all Care, and without any Partiality. Lambeth, Jan. 17. 1638/9. W. Cant. HEreupon the Vice-chancellor with other of the Heads charged 20 of their Privileged Men with Corslets, and 30 with Mus∣quets, which did almost equal the Train-Band of the City, though 20 Privi∣ledged Men charged with Corslets and 30 with Mus∣quets. the Priviledged Men were but an handful in respect of the other. From Oxford, January 28th. SIR, YOU had need be very careful of the University, for while none To the Vice-chanceller, Feb. 7. for watchfulness against the Jesuites. of you think of it, the Jesuits and their Instruments are busie thereabouts; and at this present they have seduced a young Youth of Exeter-College, I have forgotten his Name, but it begins with a His Name is Weale.

I have granted an Attachment against them, if they can light upon them before they take Shipping; as also against Cherriton, for that I hear is his Name, who seduced them. You had need be very careful in these Businesses, for else we shall very deser∣vedly hear ill of it. Lambeth, Feb. 7. 1638/9. W. Cant. SIR, I Am informed that the Masters, many of them sit bare at St. To the Vice∣chancellor, con∣cerning the Masters wear∣ing their Hats and Lawyers Gowns, and for him to look to them. Feb. 20. . I approve their sitting bare, so long as they go a∣long the Streets in their Caps, and keep Form, which the Vice-chan∣cellor assures me they do. Maries, having their Hats there, and not their Caps; rather chosing to sit bare, than to keep Form, and then so soon as they come out of the Church, they are quite out of Form all along the Streets. I am likewise told, that divers of the younger sort, and some Masters begin again to leave the wide-sleeved Gown apace, and take up that which they call the Lawyer's Gown. If both or either of these be, you had need look to it in time, before it gather Head. And if it be true for the Gowns, you must chide the Taylors that make them very severely, besides what you do to the Scholars. Lambeth, Feb. 20. . W. Cant.
SIR, I Pray take care of Lent, and the Disputations in their Beginnings, To the Vice-chancellor, Feb. ult. the forbidding of Set Coursing betwixt Col∣leges in Lent. and speak to the Heads of Houses at your next Meeting, that they warn their several Companies; that they keep Disputations at the Schools diligently, but very orderly and peaceably. And since I have now by many Years Experience observed, That coursing be∣tween one College and another is the great Mother of all Disorder, and that 'tis almost impossible to have decent and orderly Disputati∣ons, if that be permitted; These are to require You, That You suf∣fer no such Coursing at all under any Pretence. And farther, I would have you speak with the Principal of Brazen-Nose, that he would command their Cellar to be better looked to, that no strong and unruly Argument be drawn from that Topick-place. And I pray desire the Heads to be very careful, that the Disputations may be Scho∣like and peaceable. Lambeth, Feb. ult. . W. Cant. AT our Meeting on Monday last, 'twas ordered that from hence∣forth From the Vice-chancellor, March 4. Cir∣cuiting for Degrees to begin from the Schools. all Circuiting for Degrees shall begin from the Schools. We have now lest only the Friday Court in St. Marie's Church, and I hope that will not dwell there long. March 4. 1638/9. AN Order for the Lent Disputations, That no Batchelors be suf∣fered Batchelors Disputations in Lent.

Lambeth, March 29. 1639. W. Cant. LAst Week there arose a little Difference 'twixt the City and U∣niversity, but 'tis already composed. They required of all Privileged Inhabitants a Contribution towards the fitting out of their 15 Soldiers. I denyed it, Yet in the Close, That they might have no Colour to complain of our Coldness in a Business of such Impor∣tance; I gave way for the taxing of such priviledged Persons, (and such only) as exercise any kind of Merchandize amongst them. This (when they saw they could get no more) was accepted, and so the Quarrel ended. Oxford, St. Mary-Magdalen Coll. April 15. 1638/9. ABout the 20th. of April, I received Information how the New Statutes at Oxford were like to be eluded by divers Non-Resi∣dent young Men which resorted to Cambridge for their Degrees, which Information follows, in haec Verba.
HEaring that the new Statutes at Oxford permit none but those who totally reside and study there to take Degrees, and admit no Com∣putation of Terms, more than those wherein they were commorant there, so that many Discontinuers cannot in so short time proceed, as formerly there they might have done, and here with us they may yet, whereby many Batchelors of Arts of Oxford came this Year for their Degrees of Masters of Arts here, which this Year they could not obtain at Oxford, which I endeavoured to prevent, least Oxford should in a short time lose half their Proceeders, especially the Non∣continuers, for which I had no thanks here, because the Vice-chancel∣lor and Proctors lose Fees thereby, and the Colleges too; and there alledged to me that it was no prejudice to Oxford; for if it were, that University would have given publick Notice, or written to Cam∣bridge, &c. and that I had no particular Command from the Chan∣cellor so to do, whereby one Walter Crook, late of  College in Oxford, got out of Caius College Master of Arts, notwithstanding that I alledged it was a prejudice to the University of Oxford, for that he could not obtain that Degree there this Year; but the rest by op∣posing him publickly, did not put forward so much as for Incorpora∣tion, tho' in Town, except one Thomas Robins, Late of Corpus Christi Oxford; as I take it, a Batchelor of Arts and Curate, &c. whom I stayed, being accidentally in Capite Senatús twice or thrice, so that he is returned to his Cure with a heavy Heart, as I hear Crooke got out in the Head, when Dr. Eden attended Wiseman's Grace, for when I was in Capite, I stayed Crook, and gave that for my Reason. Yet I perceive, that if his Grace send not to the Vice-chancellor next Term, all will pass of any Degree, and few thereby will be left at Oxford, and the intent of their Statutes eluded by our Brethren, &c. Hereby I have procured many Frowns, and some Adversaries in Caius College for Crook's sake, and in St. John's for Robins, besides the Of∣ficers, &c. for all. Thus much I am bound in Duty to signifie to you, that it may presently be known to his Grace, whom I conceive it so nearly concerneth. Upon this Information I writ to the Vice-chancellor of Oxford, as followeth. SIR, I Have received Information from very good Hands, how our Sta∣tutes A Branch of my Letter (of April 25.) to the Vice∣chancellor up∣on this Infor∣mation. are not only like  eluded, but a great many Proceed∣ers which have Restraint put upon them by the Statutes, run to Cam∣bridge to take their Degrees there. And this I conceive will be a very great prejudice to the University, and to the Officers there. That you may the more fully understand all particulars, I send you part of the Letter, which gives you Information; but because the Hand is known, I desire you to lay it by you, and keep it for your own use. That which I would have you do for prevention in this Business is, I would have you presently now before your Journey, write a Letter to the Vice-chancellor of Cambridge, and therein tell him, that you hear of this slipping aside of Oxford Men without any leave of the Univer∣sity to take their Degrees at Cambridge, and thereby to elude our Sta∣tutes; then I would have you desire of him and the Heads, in the
Name of the University of Oxford, That no Man be suffered to take any Degree in Cambridge whatsoever, unless he bring the Consent of the University of Oxford under Seal; and you may promise the like Justice to them; in the end you may intimate if you please, that fin∣ding this Inconvenience you have acquainted me with it, but that you hope the University of Cambridge will be so careful, as that I shall not need to interpose in it, and I pray desire an Answer from him, that we may know what to trust to. April 25. 1639. W. Cant. SIR, I Pray receive this assurance from me, and I doubt not but the The Vice∣chancellor of Cambridge his Answer to Dr. Frewen's Let∣ter touching the Business aforesaid. Practice of our University will make it good, that according to your just desire, nothing shall pass here amongst us, either in this or any other way that may give the least interruption to the mutual A∣mity and Correspondence between the two Universities, &c. Cambridge, May 7th. 1639. Ra. Brownrigg. SIR, I Am informed that You give out, that after the University-Exami∣nation To Dr. Fell, Dean of Christ-Church, concerning his private Examinations after the pub∣lick. Dr. Fell hath assured. that there shall be no Examination in the Col∣lege hereafter but it shall preceed Ex∣aminations of the Uni∣versity. is past, You will have them examin'd again in the College, which is to put a Scorn and Disrepute upon the Regents for their Pains, and utterly to disparage the Examinations, as if you in Christ-Church were able to do more than the whole University in that point. And this to deal clearly with you, I neither may nor will endure. If you will examine your Students sufficiency, I like that well enough, do it in God's Name. But then do it before they come in publick to the University-Examination; for after that is once past, I will en∣dure none in any private College to prejudice it. And I pray take heed what you do in this and the like kind, that your Zeal to that, which is good, distemper us not; for if any Men be negligent, their Fault will not be well amended by your over-doing. I doubt not but you will take care of this, and give me Content. Lambeth, May 30. 1639. W. Cant. SIR, I AM informed that there is one Francius a Polonian or Transylva∣nian, To the Vice-chancellor concerning Adamus Fran∣cius. that is a desperate Socinian, and lives either in Oxford or Cambridge in a sly manner to pervert the younger sort; I pray do you be as watchful as you can, and make your Examination after him with as little noise as may be, but as much Care, &c. Lambeth, May 30. 1639. W. Cant.
And the like Advertisement at this time I sent to Cambridge also, Both the Vice-chancel∣lors sent me word that they could hear of no such Man for the present, but that they would en∣quire further after him. The Diffe∣rence be∣tween Proctor Fulham and Dr. Fell Dean of Christ-Church, in the case of Moore. concerning this Francius the Socinian. I Received a Complaint under the Hand of Mr. Edward Fulham of Christ-Church, and Proctor of the University, against Dr. Fell, which was sent me by the Vice-chancellor, in his Letters of June 3. at the intreaty of the Proctor. The occasion this, as it follows in the Proctor's own Relation, in haec verba: ON the 31st. of May about 8 at Night, Mr. Proctor Fulham witho ther Senior Masters of that House standing near the College-gate, observed amongst others coming out of the Town into the College in their Hats one Edward Moore with his Hat on; the rest, as soon as they came within the view of the Proctor, modestly put off their Hats, and endeavoured to hide them; but Moore passed boldly by the Proctor without moving his Hat, whereupon the Proctor call'd him back, and question'd him for wearing his Hat in the Town, tel∣ling him, that since he was in a fault, it would have better becom'd him to hide it, than to wear it on his Head. Moore clapping on his Hat, replied, that he was in the College. The Proctor twice or thrice admonish'd him to put off his Hat; but he refusing, and con∣testing with his Hat on, the Proctor (having before complained on a Scholar of the House that had affronted him in like manner, and be∣ing very much slighted, as he conceived with this Answer, That in such Cases he was to be considered there but as an ordinary Master of Arts,) gave him a gentle Box on the Ear; and the said Moor conti∣nuing in his Contumacy, was charged according to Statute by the Proctor to go to the Castle; but the said Moore went not, but re∣paired to Mr. Hide, being his Deputy-Tutor in the absence of Mr. Glisson to be advised. Mr. Hide brought Moore to Mr. Dean of Christ-Church, and complained of the Proctor as if he had done the Scholar wrong. Upon this Complaint, Mr. Dean sends for the Proctor to his Lodging, in the presence of Moore, and Mr. Hide condemns the Proctor, and justifies Moore, and very much rated and check'd the Proctor; telling him, that he had done more than he could justifie, and that he should have nothing to do in the College; and that if he meddled thus in the House, he would meddle with him: That he was not Dean of Christ-Church, nor should be. And (by way of De∣rision) asked him, why he questioned not him and other Doctors that passed by that way, for their Hats; adding, That he got no good Will by being so busie; and so warned the Proctor to appear before the Chapter next Morning at 9 of the Clock, to answer for what he had done, in the mean time allowed Moore all Liberty of Speech to inter∣pose and justifie his Fault. And Mr. Dean expresly told the Proctor, That Moore should not go to the Castle notwithstanding Command; and Mr. Hide (tho' sworn Pro-proctor) at the same time abbetting the said Moore told the Proctor he had done more than he could justisie in striking the said Moore, and that he ought not to go to the Castle upon his Command; using many other Words of Contestation and Reproach to the Proctor and his Authority. And Mr. Hide also said, That he had bid his Scholar not go to the Castle, but first go to Mr.
Dean to complain — Mr. Proctor hath observ'd and inform'd Mr. Dean as much, That the Gentlemen-Commoners sit in the Hall in Hats be∣fore him, bring them to the Church constantly, walk and stand under his Window, some in Boots, and most in Hats; and as the Proctor pas∣seth by, they stand to it, upon what Encouragement he knows not. Edw. Fulham, Procur. Sen. UPon this Information, I referred the Examination of the whole Business to Mr. Vice-chancellor, with a Charge, that in regard that Moore had broken the Statute of the University, (tho' he had then a little slipt by the Proctor into the College) he should commit him to the Castle in pursuance of the Proctor's Command, and to uphold his Authority, that it might not grow contemptible all the Year after in the University. And that then, if he found the Com∣plaint of the Proctor to be true, he should speak with the Heads, and see whether any fit Course could be taken for removing of Hide from the Pro-proctor-ship; and that he should cause Moore for his Fault and his Sawciness together to be publickly whipt in the Convocation House, or banish'd the University. And as for the Dean, I did re∣serve to my self what Check I would put upon him. And after the Proctor had made offer to justifie all this Complaint upon Oath, I writ to the Dean as followeth, SIR, I Have received two Letters from You the last Week and this, and My Letters to Dr. Fell a∣bout the a∣foresaid Busi∣ness. both concerning the Accident fallen out between you and Proctor Fulham in the case of Moore. In your last Letter, you tell me there is a lameness fallen upon you, (which I am sorry for) and had not that happened, you would have come and given me an Account of the Business at Lambeth; but had you come, you would utterly have lost your Labour. For I would have spent no time, having so little to run to waste, to hear one side only, where two are concerned. For the Business it self, I see you decline answering it to the Vice∣chanchellor, under pretence, that it was done within your Gates. But first, I would pray you to  that the Fault in question was done without your Gates, for it was for wearing a Hat in the Town. And howsoever, be the Cause what it will, I will not suffer any pri∣vate Governour to wrong a publick Officer in any kind whatsoever, but that he shall answer it to my Vice-chancellor if he do. For I well know, the Proctor will have little Credit abroad in the Streets, if he shall have Contempt put upon him at Home in his College. Se∣condly, your declining the Vice-chancellor in this manner, and your refusing to answer upon Oath, when the Proctor offers to justifie all his Complaint by Oath in every particular, makes me think the Proctor's Relation is true in every Circumstance; and if it be true both in Circumstance and Substance, tho' for Government sake, (which you have so slighted in the Proctor) I shall be unwilling to put any Sowerness upon you in publick; yet must I tell you, you have carried this Business like a sudden, hasty, and weak Man, and most
unlike a Man that understands Government. And should you go on with other things according to this, I shall have cause to repent some∣what. And assure your self, if I hear any more like this I shall easi∣ly know what I have to do. This to your self under Seal; so &c. Lambeth, June 22. 1639. W. Cant. THE Vice-chancellor in the mean time proceeded against Moore, but finding the Youth very Humble and Submissive, and but new come to the University, and the Proctor himself earnestly inter∣ceeding for him, took his private Submission, but enjoyned him pub∣lickly in Christ-Church Hall to deliver the Proctor an Epistle with an acknowledgment of his Fault, which was done accordingly. And for Hide, he was passed by, and was not Pro-Proctor this Year, but one Mr. William Cartwright of Corpus Christi had that place.

Two ignorant Batchelors re∣pelled by the Vice-chancellor from their Admission; They were of Glocester-Hall. from their Admission, which was a very wholsome Ex∣ample to uphold the Statute of Examination. But thereupon I writ to him, not to let it rest there, but to call in question those Ma∣sters that examined them, who went directly against their Oath, in giving Testimony to such ignorant Men, and desired him to be as careful as he could in this Business. And this Repulse was made in the view of the New Regents, who were then all there present to be admitted. For this his first Year the Vice-chancellor brought into the Univer∣sity 831 l. brought into the Universi∣ty Chest for this Year. Chest in ready Mony 831 l. 19 s. 2 d. all Deductions made; and repaid likewise to Sir Thomas Bodley's Stock the 500 l. borrowed thence for the Purchase of Land for the Anatomy-Lecture. And being so before-hand, he bought in the Annuity which they paid to one Giles for Ground, on which the Schools stand; the Annuity was Eight Annuity of 8 l. per Ann. bought in. Pounds per Annum, he paid for it 122 l. Memorandum, That the 500 l. above-mentioned was no part of the 831 l. which the Vice-chancellor brought in. So that now there remains in the University Chest at Corpus Christi almost 1000 l. and in Sir Thomas Bodley's Chest at the Schools 600 l. The Uni∣versity stock at present. and the Yearly Incomes of the University for the future may be pitcht upon a Medium at a Thousand Marks communibus annis. Other Vice∣chancellors brought in very fair Accompts, and some larger than this, but they were expended upon their Building according to Sir Thomas Bodley's Will, &c. W. Cant. After my Hearty Commendations, &c. THE Vice-chancellor which now is hath gone through the trou∣blesome Dr. Frewen continued Vice-chancellor a second year. Office of the Vice-chancellor-ship for the space of one whole Year, and this time of the Year puts me in mind thereof, which calls for a new Nomination and Election according to Course and Statute to be made. But tho' I proceed to a new Nomination,
yet I can no way hold it fit to nominate a New Vice-chancellor, but shall continue that Trouble and Pains to Dr. Frewen for one Year more. And this I hold necessary to do, not only for the great Integrity and Sufficiency with which he hath managed thatOffice for this Year past; but also in particular for the great Success with which God hath blessed him in putting that useful Statute of the Examination of Candidates into Practice, which must needs tend to the great Benefit and Honour of that University in all succeeding times. And I am very desirous to continue it in the same Hand, and under the same Care for another Year, to the end it may the better settle. These are therefore to let you know, that I do nominate and choose Dr. Frewen to be my Vice-chancellor for this Year ensuing. And do hereby pray and require You to allow of this my Choice, and to give him all due Respect and Assistance in all things necessary for that Go∣vernment. And thus not doubting of your Readiness and willing Obedience herein, I leave both himself and you to the Grace of God, and rest Your Loving Friend and Chancellor, W. Cant. POST-SCRIPT. THere is an Advertisement, which tho' I have given You Mr. Warning, given, that the Masters keep their Seats, whilest either any publick Letters are read, or so∣lemnSpeeches made in Con∣vocation. Vice-chancellor already in a private Letter, yet I thought now fit to mention it again in these publick Letters, that the whole Uni∣versity might the better take notice of it. There is I confess, an old but a very ill Custom continued in the Convocation-House; Name∣ly, that whensoever the Vice-chancellor or either of the Proctors have an occasion to read any publick Letters, or make any Solemn Speech to that Body; the Masters do all or most of them rise from their Seats and come and stand confusedly before him that speaks, expresly contrary to Statute, and taking off all Decency and Dignity from that place. 'Tis probable, That this might arise at first upon a desire to hear some Vice-chancellor or Proctor who had a lower Voice; but far better it is, that any such should be imperfectly heard, than the whole Order, Form and Dignity of a Convocation-House should be thereby lost. These are therefore to require every Member of that House to keep his Seat according to Statute, and not to stir or draw nearer the Vice-chancellor or Proctors upon any pretence of hearing, or any other whatsoever, and that they so continue in their Seats all the time of every several Convocation. And if any Man shall thus a∣gainst Statute presume to leave his Seat, and so either break the Or∣der, or disturb the Peace of the House, I do hereby require, that the Vice-chancellor command him to Prison, and give me Notice of his Name; and that he that is to speak proceed not on with his Speech, until the House shall continue settled in every part. And fur∣ther, No Man to enter the Convocation-House upon pain of Im∣prisonment, that is not a Member of that Body. I require the Vice-chancellor and Proctors for the Time being, and their Successors, to commit any Man to the Castle, that shall presume to come within the Convocation-House Door, that is not a Member of that Body. And I do require that these my Letters be Registred, that this Direction may be the better kept in Memory. Lambeth, July 10. 1639. W. Cant.
THE Vice-chancellor hearing of three poor Scholars, (two of Ex∣eter The Vice∣chancellor sent his Warrant for three Scholars, who had shewn College-plate in Town which  had batter'd together. College and the third of Christ-Church) that had shewed certain small pieces of Batter'd Plate in a Towns-man's House, sent his Warrant for them. But two fled, and the other came before him; where being not able to make any Defence, than by casting all upon them that appeared not, the Vice-chancellor expell'd him the University; whereby it is hoped the College-Plate for the future will be safer. July 22. 1639. THere was a great Inconveniency found in the Examinations of Fixt Seats for the Exa∣miners and the Candidates. such as came for Degrees; for the Examiners and the Exami∣ned could hardly be kept at a sitting distance in such a Throng of Au∣ditors; and being upon the same Level, it was therefore thought fit, both for the Ease and Reputation of the Examiners, and the publick discharge of that Business, that nothing might pass by whispering, That the Examiners should stand in the Seat appointed for the Na∣tural-Philosophy-Reader (that School being by Statute appointed for the place of the Examinations,) and another Seat be set up opposite for the Candidates, and a Seat upon one side for the Vice-chancellor and Proctors to sit whensoever they should please to come to the Exami∣nations. And this was done accordingly, that it might be ready a∣gainst Michaelmass-Term. September 11. 1639. W. Cant. SIR, THis next passage I shall desire you to communicate with the Heads, A Branch of my Letters (of Octob. 4.) to the Vice∣chancellor a∣bout the ob∣serving of Formalities. and let both them and the Proctors know, That I have been infor∣med that some Masters come to St. Maries, and stand or sit there bare in Sermon time, not out of any Devotion, but only to hide their Hats. The end why I write this to you is, because I doubt if you look not well to it at the beginning of Term, you will find a Breach upon that Decency of the University before you be aware; and the reason why I desire you to impart it to the Heads and the Proctors is, because I know the Work will be too heavy for you alone, if they shall not concur to give you their best assistance in their several Stations. These are therefore to pray and require every of them to look strictly to their several Charges, and to assist you in all things according to the Statutes in the University, in which if any Man shall fail, I shall take it so much the worse from him, as there is greater necessity to hold up good Order in the brokeness of these times. And further, I think it not amiss that you employ the omen-Beadles to look about the Church in Sermon time, and see who they are that in any cunning way offer to break the Statutes. I know this will be a work full of Envy to them; and therefore I think it may be very fit that you think of a Course how they may have profit by it, to sweeten their pains. And for my part, if you and the Heads shall find it so fit, I think it were not amiss, if out of the mulcts for those Offences some Proportion were given to them for their pains. But above all things, I desire you and the Proctors, and all else whom it may Concern, to continue your wonted Care of the Examinations, which will I hope prove a great Honour, and a greater advantage to the University. Lambeth, Octob. 4. 1639. W. Cant.
ONE Elzy, a busie Attorney of the King's-Bench, pleaded his Ex∣emption Elzy the At∣torney. in point of Debt from the Chancellor's Court; and brought a Writ out of the Court of King's-Bench. But at last found his Errour, and submitted, yet not till some of the Judges of that Court had in a manner declared themselves for the University Juris∣diction, as his Case stood. Octob. 12. 1639. W. Cant. THE Chandlers (two of that Company being Aldermen of the The Chandlers about the Price of Candles. City) took upon them to sell Candles at a Price above that which was set by the Vice-Chancellor: And being called to an Ac∣count, they at the first, and again, wilfully refused to submit. The Vice-Chancellor, by the advice of the Heads, was resolved to make the two Aldermen an Example for the rest: Namely, first to call them, and demand the Mulct due for their Offence: And if they refused to pay, then to call them into the Chancellor's-Court; and that if they appear'd not there, he would call a Convocation and discommune them. But at last, when they had thought better on't, they promised Sub∣mission. Octob. 4. 1639. W. Cant. YOUR Grace's Directions touching the raising of Seats for the A Passage out of the Vice-Chan∣cellor's Letters touching the Seats for the Examinations. Examiners and Candidates appear already to be very useful, and very much to advance the Examinations. On Thursday we began, when tho' the School full from one end to the other, yet all stood silent and attentive; and well they might; for the Actors on both sides per∣formed their Parts so well, that we met again in the Afternoon; and near three it was before that days Examinations were ended. Your Grace hath been sundry ways most munificent towards this Uni∣versity: Yet (without Flattery be it spoken) this one Statute is Your greatest Benefaction. Fear of Shame and Repulse prevailing more upon our Youth, than the severest Discipline of any private College whatsoever could have done. Octob. 13. 1639. A. Frewen.
COncerning the hour of your Vespers, I would have you to weigh A Passage of my Letters to Dr. Fell, D. of Christ Church, concerning a  made to him by the Students there, for the change of their hour of Vespers from four to five. well one main thing; which is, That as the Morning Service is every where to end by Twelve at farthest, so the Vespers never begin before Three, and end by Five. And this I take it is universal. And the reason of it (as I conceive) is, That the Prayers of the Church, howsoever different in place, might be jointly put up to God in all places at the same time. How sit it will be upon particular respects to vary such an universal Tradition, would be well thought on. As for the Hour which they say they shall gain to their Studies by this change, that works little upon me. For if Men be so studiously minded, that Hour may be taken, as well after Prayers as before. And Prayers coming between, will rather be a Relaxation to them than a hindrance. Besides, I cannot foresee what Example this may produce in other Cathedrals. And I would be very loath they should learn an ill Ex∣ample from the University. Therefore I pray think well of these and other Circumstances, before you make any change. Lambeth, Octob. 18. 1639. W. Cant. I Am informed, that under pretence of Printing a Greek Chro∣nologer Sir H.  Greek Letters in Turner the  hands. On Thursday . 13.  the Greek Let∣ters, and deli∣ver'd them by weight as  receiv'd them: there were  any wanting. He came very unwillingly . (one Malala) which Mr. Gregory of C. C. was preparing for the Press: Turner the Printer (I know not by what Commission) got into his Hands all Sir Henry Savil's Greek Letters amounting to a great number, some of them scarce worn. It was in Dr. Pinck's time. I pray speak with the Dr. about it, and call Turner to an Account be∣fore the Heads, what's become of them. I doubt Turner's Poverty and Knavery together hath made a riddance of them. I pray examine this Business thoroughly before the Heads, and let me have an Ac∣count when you have done. Lambeth, Octob. 18. 1639. W. Cant. SIR, I Would have you send me word in what state my Arabick Lecture To Mr. Thomas , of C. C. C. con∣cerning my  Lecture. Mr. Greaves was at this time Deputy-Reader to Mr. , who . stands at Oxford, on what days and hours of the days you read, and what Ordinances are made (if any be) by which you guide your self in that Business: And farther, I would have you set me down what Statutes may be necessary to govern that Lecture in the perpetu∣ating of it, in case it should please God to make me able to do it. I pray do this with as much convenient speed as you can, and privately without noise: So to God's Blessing and Protection, &c. Lambeth. F. omnium Sanctorum, 1639. W. Cant.
THE University of Oxford in the time of King Edw. III. had the The State of the Title of the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, for Licensing and Suppressing of , &c. And this a∣gainst the May∣or and Justices of the Town. This was drawn up by Council out of that which was shewed them by the Univer∣sity. sole keeping of the Assize of Bread and Drink in Oxford, and the Government and Correction of all manner of Victuallers, and Victualling and Tippling-Houses there. This Power continued in the University for about 200 Years with∣out Interruption, until the Statute of 5 & 6 Edw. 6. which gave power to two Justices of Peace in every Shire or City to License Ale-Houses; and ordained, That none should keep any Ale-House but such as should be so Licensed. By colour of this Statute (in regard there was therein no express saving of the Privileges of the University) the Mayor and Aldermen of Oxford, being Justices there, have Licensed Ale-Houses. The Chancellor of the University and his Vice-Chancellor, Com∣missary and Deputy at the time of the making of the said Statutes were Justices of Peace within the City. And the Privileges of both Universities were afterwards in 13 Eliz. confirmed by Act of Parlia∣ment; and in all Acts of Parliament since made touching Ale-Houses, the Correction and Punishment of all Ale-House-keepers and Tipplers in Ale-Houses in the University, is reserved solely to the Governor of the University. The University of Cambridge in the Fifth Year of King Richard II. had their Privileges by Parliament granted to them, such as the Uni∣versity of Oxford had, and no other. Yet when the Officers of the Town in the Sixth Year of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to License Ale-House, they were restrain'd by the Queen's Letter, and that Uni∣versity hath ever since quietly enjoy'd the Privileges of the sole Li∣censing of Ale-Houses. In the Book of Directions touching Ale-Houses, set forth 1608. His late Majesty declared, that the Officers of both Universities should have the Power of Licensing and ordering of Ale-Houses, and not the Officers or Justices of the Town. And His Majesty in his Charter of Confirmation of the Liberties of the University of Oxford in the Eleventh Year of his Reign, hath been graciously pleased to grant that no License shall be made to any Victualler or Ale-House-keeper, without the special assent of the Chancellor. There are now 300 Ale-Houses Licensed in Oxford, which occasion great Disorder in the University. It is therefore most humbly desired on the behalf of the said Uni∣versity, That his Majesty would be pleased by his gracious Letters to be directed to the Mayor and Commonalty of Oxford, to command them not to intermeddle in the Licensing of any Person to keep Ale-House or Tap-House within the Jurisdiction or Liberty of the said University or City of Oxford.
TRusty and Well-beloved, we Greet you well. We are informed His Majesty's  to con∣firm this Right for appointing of , &c. in the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor. that our University of Oxford had heretofore the Government Correction of all manner of Ale-House-keepers, Ale-Houses and Tippling-Houses within the Liberties thereof: And we were graciously pleased lately by our Letters Patents to grant to our said Uni∣versity, That no Ale-Houses without the special consent of the Chan∣cellor or Vice-Chancellor should be Licensed there. It seems strange to us (which we hear) that there should be now Three hundred Ale-Houses in Oxford: And we believe they would not have risen to that number, had the power of Licensing them rested only with the Vice-Chancellor and other Governors of our said University, as it doth in our University of Cambridge. We do therefore charge and require you, as you tender our Pleasure, and mean to enjoy the Liberties which you use under our Favour and Goodness, that you henceforth meddle not in the Licensing of any Person to keep Ale-Houses, Tap-Houses, or Victualling-Houses within the Jurisdiction or Liberty of the said University, and City of Oxford, but that you leave the same to the Vice-Chancellor and other Justices of Peace there, who are Members of the said University. Given at Westminster the 27th of October, 1639. To our Trusty and Well-beloved, the Mayor, Bailiffs, and Commo∣nalty of our City of Oxford. I sent away these Letters to the Vice-Chancellor upon Friday No∣vember 8th. W. Cant. UPON pretence that it was not in me alone to absolve the Chand∣lers, From the Vice-Chancel∣lor: The Sub∣mission of the Chandlers to the University. on Monday last I brought them to the Meeting of the Heads. Where having in the first Place pleaded Ignorance in excuse of their Contumacy, they then confessed openly, That it belonged to the Vice-Chancellor to regulate them in their Trade, and humbly be∣sought me to raise their Price. This done I dismissed them, caused the Register to make an Act of what had passed, and four days after (viz. on the first of November) granted their Request; so that I hope the University's Right in this particular is now settled for ever hereafter. Novemb. 4. 1639. A. Frewen. I Am informed by Mr. Lenthall, That for the Physick-Garden the From the Vice-Chancellor con∣cerning my . of Danby's gift of an 100 l. for the Physick-Garden. Earl of Danby intends to put his Heir, the Vice-Chancellor, the Dean of Christ-Church, and the President of St. Mary Magdalen-College in trust to see his promised 100 l. per Annum for ever hereafter im∣ployed as he shall direct. A. Frewen.
To this my Answer was as followeth: I Like the Earl of Danby's Business worse and worse; and the join∣ing My Answer to the foresaid Passage. of his Heir to those Heads you mention worst of all. For if he may not ever do, and have what he list, you shall have greater Imputations of Ingratitude thrown upon you than the thing is worth. And now I begin to believe you will have nothing settled till his Death. Lambeth, Novemb. 7. 1639. W. Cant. EVery Body speaks well of the Examinations. And tho' I would To the Vice-Chancellor for some of the Heads to be now and then at the Exami∣nations. not put any such Burthen upon the Heads of Houses, yet you should do very well if you could handsomly insinuate it to them, what an Advance it would be to the University in that Business, if now and then at their leisure some one or other of them would come thither, and sit with the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors to hear the Examina∣tions. But this I leave free to you and them. Lambeth, November 7. 1639. W. Cant. AT this time the Vice-Chancellor sent me word, that after they Charge given to the Library∣keepers by the Vice-Chancel∣lor and Visitors to look well to my Manu∣scripts and Coins. had visited Sir Thomas Bodley's great Library, they went to see my Books and Coins, and that having compared them with their Cata∣logue, they found all well and safe. But yet the Library-keepers had a great charge given them to look carefully to them, being they stood unchained, and the place where they stand almost hourly frequented by Strangers who come to see them. Novemb. 11. 1639. A. Frewen. My Answer to this was as followeth. SIR, I Thank you heartily for your Care of my Books. And I beseech My Answer to the Vice-Chan∣cellor's fore∣said Passage, touching the care to be  to my Manu∣scripts and Coins. you that the Library-keeper may be very watchful to look to them since they stand unchain'd. And I would to God the Place in the Li∣brary for them were once ready, that they might be set up safe; and and chained as the other Books are; and yet then, if there be not care taken, you may have some of the best and choisest Tractats cut out of the Covers and purloin'd, as hath been done in some other Libraries. Lambeth, Nov. 15. 1639. W. Cant.
WHilst I was at the Examinations on Saturday Novem. 16. there A Gent. un∣known came to hear the Examinations Nov. 16. 1639. came into the School a Stranger who seem'd to be of very good Quality; for he had three or four Servants attending him. There he sat a diligent Auditor for the space of an hour. Then went forth, and taking Horse at the Gate, vanish'd, without leaving any possibility of a discovery what he was; for there was not any Scholar seen in his Company; nor can I find that he did so much as stop at any Inn. What ever the ends of his coming were, he cannot but speak well of the Exer∣cise; for 'twas at that very time singularly well performed. Out of his Letters of Novem. 18. 1639. A. Frewen. My Judgment upon this was as follows. SIR, 'TIS a pretty Accident of the Gentleman's coming to hear the Ex∣aminations My Answer to the foresaid Passage. upon Saturday last: And I am heartily glad the Ex∣ercise was so good, and worthy his Audience. But as his coming was unexpected, and his departure sudden, so we must be contented to leave his Person unknown, unless some accident discover it. But what say you to this? May it be some Jesuit attended with three or four The Vice-Chan∣cellor sent me word that now the Heads were of the same Opinion. Novices, that came to see what this new Business is in the University? For why any Gentleman in the Kingdom should come and go in that fashion, without so much as saluting the Vice-Chancellor, being pre∣sent upon the place, I for my part cannot tell, nor do I believe any would so do. Lambeth, Novem. 20. 1639. W. Cant. IT is strongly presum'd that Mr. Bowden, a Divine of Trinity-College, A Passage out of the Vice-Chancellor's Letter Dec. 2. concerning Mr. Bowden of Trinity-College. hath drown'd himself. His Discontent (as their Vice-President informs me) arose from Contemplation of his Debts to the College, which he foresaw he should not be able to clear at their Audit. On Thursday Seven-night in the Morning he was met very early going to∣wards New-Parks, and hath not been seen since that time. A. Frewen. The like Passage I had from Dr. Baylie concerning Mr. Bowden, which follows. Mr. Baylie con∣cerning Mr. Bowden. He was found drown'd on Thurs. Dec. 12. 1639. at Kings Mills by Holy∣well. And the Co∣roners Inquest found him a distractedMan; and so indeed he was. ABout the beginning of the last Week one Mr. Bowden, Fellow of Trinity-College (whom they have suspected for craz'd heretofore) after the exchange of some cross words with the President in the Gate, betwixt 6 and 7 in the Morn, went out of the College, and cannot as yet (though diligently sought) be found. It is fear'd that he hath drowned himself. Decemb. 2. 1639. Ri. Baylie.
A Young Man, lately Commoner of Wadham-College and expelled An Informa∣tion from the Vice-Chancellor; touching two Fellows of Wadham-Coll. assaulted and wounded by a Commoner lately expell'd that House. thence, comes last Night to the Sign of the Greyhound; there he puts on a false Name, and under that disguise sends for two of the Fellows of that College (to whom he bore a grudge) to Sup with him. They come, he, seconded by another, whom he brought with him for that purpose, and Vizarded, meets them under our Grove-Wall; there they assaulted the naked Scholars and shrewdly wounded them. One of them is apprehended, and in the Castle, the other is fled, but known. Oxford, Dec. 2. 1639. A. Frewen. Whereupon I writ to the Vice-Chancellor, that he would be careful to do what might be done by Law for the vindicating of the two Fellows, and the great wrong done them. And that he that was known and fled might be taken. FOR your Court-Leet, if it be so expenceful as you mention, and To the Vice∣chancellor a∣bout settling Judge Jones's Order between the University and the City, concerning their Court-Leets, &c. of so little use, since the Vice-Chancellor can do all in his private Chamber without contradiction, which he can do in that Court, I shall not advise any frequent keeping of it. Yet since I writ last, my Lord of Berkshire, their Steward, hath been earnest with me, that the Articles of Agreement between the University and the Town might be settled according to Judge Jones his Order; and truly I think that were not amiss to take the offer while they are willing. For my now Lord of Berkshire presses me to move the Judge to  it: And as far as I remember the stop hath been in the Town it self, and neither in the University nor the Judge. And tho' their refusing of setting to their Hands were especially concerning the Court-Leet; yet I do not think but that all Orders may be agreed to, if they please, and that yet you need keep that Court no oftner than you think fit your selves. According as you write next to me, so shall I speak to the Judge about it. Lambeth, Decemb. 6. 1639. W. Cant. I Am sorry to hear that the Lady Margaret's Reader is so subject to Dr. Lawrence La. Margaret's Reader, to be dispens'd with for not Read∣ing, by reason of his Sickness and often Re∣lapses. Infirmities: And if he continue so weak and full of Relapses, I think you shall do well to dispense at least with his diligence the next Term, if he gather not strength in the Interim. For I would be loth so able and careful a Man should lose himself by taking so much Pains before he enjoy a confirm'd Health; which certainly is fit for you and the University to consider, especially since you write that he hath been almost every Week this Term at Death's Door. Lambeth, Decemb. 6. 1639. W. Cant.
ON Monday Nov. 18. the Vice-Chancellor sent his Majesty's, con∣cerning Concerning 300 Alehouses in Oxford, and the ordering of them ac∣cording to his Majesty's Let∣ters. Ale-Houses, to the Mayor and Aldermen. Upon the Receipt of them they consulted very privately, but yet it was easily known to be about the Contents of that Letter, because they enquired how many Ale-Houses were in every Parish. And this doubtless they did, to see if they could disprove the Information given to his Majesty, concerning the number of 300 Ale-Houses within the Town. But Dr. Fell, Dean of Christ-Church, who by my direction looked very narrow∣ly into the Business, made his Information good by the Testimony of the Ale-Brewer's Clerk, Servant to that College. And though this number be extremely too great; yet so long as Bakers and Brewers have the power of granting Licenses, no Man is like to be denied, that will take his Bread of the one, and his Ale of the other. The Vice-Chancellor presently gave me notice of all this, least the Town should inform the Earl of Berkshire their Steward, and perhaps untruly, and so possess him against the University: And it seems they did so. For my Lord meeting me at Court, spake with me about the business, and acknowledged from them but 160 Ale-Houses, and that most of these were Privileged Persons, and Licensed by the University, contrary to their own Promise and Undertaking at the open Sessions; but spake nothing of the procuring of the Letter it self, which I was very glad of, and  his Lordship, that I verily believed he was mis∣inform'd in all particulars, as I doubted not but it would plainly appear. In the mean time the Vice-Chancellor very discreetly went on to the The Order by which the Vice-Chancel∣lor proceeded in the . Reformation of this Scandal to the University; in which he proceed∣ed thus. First, That it might appear he aim'd at the good of the University, in the License which he drew up for the future, he makes it a Forfei∣ture of his Recognizance for any Ale-House-keeper to receive any Scholar into his House to drink and tipple there. Secondly, So soon as he had his full Proof that there were 300, he commanded the Constables of every Parish to bring in the Names of all such as sell Ale there. This Note he communicated with the Proctors, and turned out all such as in their several Night-Walks they had found to keep disorderly Houses. Thirdly, After this he sent the same Note to some of the most sub∣stantial and orderly Men in every Parish, and by their Advice struck out all those which had any Trade or other means to live by, that being a far fitter Course for them than Ale-House-keeping. Fourthly, To the end no cunning of the Town might be able to elude this, he deliver'd to the Ale-Brewers the Names of all such as are now Licensed, with a charge not to serve Ale to any other upon Pe∣nalty of paying the Mulct, which both the Statutes of the Realm and of the University inflict upon Offenders in that particular. And as for the Allegation which they made to my Lord the Earl of That almost all this vast number of Ale∣houses were Licens'd by the Mayor and the Town-Justices. Berkshire in their excuse, that proves utterly void. For 1st, The number of 300 at the least is fully proved. 2dly, Were it true that the most of these were Privileged Persons, that would not help them neither: For the greatest part, even of the Privileged Men, have been Licensed by themselves for their own Profit. 3dly, On the University part no Justice hath given allowance to any but the Vice-Chancellor only: Neither can
any License continue longer than for one Year. 4thly, The Vice-Chancel∣lor Vid. Dalton. p. 376, & 377. that now is, hath been in that Office a Year and an half, and in all this time hath not Licensed any one till now, that His Majesty's Letters Alderman Bos∣worth (as I have been since inform'd by very good hands) Licen∣sed 100 for his part, and tied them all to take their Beer of him. came down to settle that Power in me and the University, according to our antient Privileges in that behalf. 'Tis true, that some produced an∣tient Licenses subscribed by some of the Vice-Chancellor's Predecessors, as namely by Dr. Pinck and Dr. Baylie in their several Years respectively. But these, as they were out of Date, so were they very few, not exceed∣ing 20 in the whole number. By all which it appears manifestly, that almost all this Scandalous number of 300 were Licensed by the Mayor and the Town-Justices, and not by the University, as hath been suggested to my Lord their Steward. The Vice-Chancellor took for his Assistant in this Business Dr. Pinck, Warden of New-College, who had been Vice-Chancellor, and best under∣stood the State of the Town (tho' Dr. Fell had means to be best ac∣quainted All these Pas∣sages are col∣lected out of the Vice-Chan∣cellor's Letters to me of No∣vemb. 20. of Nov. 25. and of Decemb. 2. with the number of the Ale-Houses:) And for a beginning supprest 200 of the 300, and then found it impossible for the present to sink them lower, there being so many poor and indigent People amongst them, who have no other possible means of Subsistance. Among these appear'd a lamentable Spectacle: For the only Son of Mr. Braddell (who had for many Years together in my Memory been Principal of St. Mary's Hall, and lived well, but in too free a fashion) was now found to be one of this number; yet for some reasons the Vice-Chancellor refused to Li∣cense him among the rest, unless the Principal of Brazen-Nose, and the Provost of Oriel (which were of his Father's antient Acquaintance, and now pleaded for him) would become his Sureties; and so the Business stands at present. December 7. 1639. W. Cant. ARticles of Agreement 'twixt the University and City, being made by From the Vice-Chancellor con∣cerning an old Composition, 23 Eliz. which gives the Uni∣versity half the Amercements of the Court Leets. Justice Jones, 'twas on all hands thought fit that they should have a time of Probation before they were signed by Your Grace and their Steward. In this interim we found a Composition made Eliz. 23. where∣in it was accorded that the Amercements of our Leet (which the Judge had awarded wholly to the Town) should equally be divided 'twixt both Bodies. This when the Judge saw, he altered his Opinion in that par∣ticular, and order'd that the Composition should still stand in force. The Mayor, Recorder and Town-Clerk there present assented, but next day fell off, upon pretence that the Commonalty would not yield: And here we stick. They press to have the Judge's first Order confirm'd, which gives all the Amercements to them. We plead an antient Composition (seen since, and allow'd by the same Judge) which gives us half. Their own Recorder is ashamed of them, and hath sundry times complain'd to me of their peevishness and breach of Promise in this particular. If they be now in earnest (whereof I much doubt) we will give them a Meeting when they please, and once more try whether by a friendly Parly these Differences may be composed. Oxford, Decem. 9. 1639.

THE Earl of Danby sent last Week Outlandish Workmen to enter Outlandish Workmen sent by the Earl of Danby for the Physick-Gar∣den. upon the Physick-Garden. They were directed to the Dean of Christ-Church, Dr. Clayton, and my self. We have perused divers Models which they brought, and amongst them pitch'd upon one, which we think will be most proper for that place. December 9. 1639. A. Frewen. I Would have you at your next meeting acquaint the Heads, that the Warning gi∣ven for the Oxford Men to use the Prayer which the Ca∣non requires before the  at St.  Cross. The Vice-Chan∣cellor hath un∣dertaken this by his Letters of Dec. 16. 39. Oxford Men who came to preach at St. Paul's, do not so frequently use the Prayer which the Canon of the Church requires before their Ser∣mons, either in matter or form, as the Cambridge Men do. And there is more notice taken of it than I could wish there were: Therefore the Heads shall do very well to warn their several Companies concerning it. And I pray be you careful to see it observed there, and that will teach them to do it abroad. Lambeth, Decemb. 13. 1639. W. Cant. THere came a Letter this Week from Cambridge to my Chaplain, Dr. An Accumula∣tion desired at Cambridge by Mr. S. Wilkin∣son, once of Madg. Hall, Oxon. Dec. 20. Bray, in which I find that one Mr. Samuel Wilkinson, a Master of Art, sometimes of Magdalen-Hall, and now Parson or Vicar of Chelsey, came thither to be Doctor, and would accumulate. And this was cer∣tainly to elude our Statutes. Dr. Sterne, one of the Heads there, called for his Certificate from you according to the Letters which you lately sent to that University by my Direction: But he being able to shew none, save only a Ticket from Mr. French, the Register, was refused. I pray call French unto you, and examine what Tickets he uses to send in this kind, and by what Authority; and I pray put him to it close. For if he may do this, we may have Proceeders slip away from us, I know not how. As now it might have been, if Dr. Sterne had not been a very respectful Man to me. December 20. 1639. W. Cant. UPON this the Vice-Chancellor called Mr. French to an account, Out of the Vice-Chancel∣lor's Letter, Frenche's An∣swer concern∣ing the afore∣said Passage. who confessed that Wilkinson writ to him the last Vacation, to know what Year it was he proceeded Master; and little suspecting what use would be made of it, (and the less because it was about the middle of the great Vacation) he sent him a Note out of the Register, which was it he presented at Cambridge; but protests, that since the Vice-Chan∣cellor's coming in Office, he never gave more than that one Ticket. December 23. 1639. A. Frewen.
IN the interim hearing that Wilkinson had under-hand gotten a Recom∣mendation My Lord Hol∣land's Recom∣mendations of Wilkinson to Cambridge, and his Lordship's promise that . should keep the A∣greement made with Ox∣ford about Pro∣ceeders. from my Lord the Earl of Holland, Chancellor of Cambridge, and having occasion one day to meet with my Lord, I spake to his Lord∣ship about it; but my Lord remembred no such thing. Yet told me he would speak to his Secretary about the Business, and then give me a farther Account. Which the very next day he did; and confessed unto me that he had given him a Recommendation, but thought Wilkinson had come attested from the University. And withal his Lordship said, that the Reason which he gave him why he went to Cambridge for his Degree, was, because the Fees were greater in Oxford. Upon this his Lordship promised me that he would write to Cambridge, that the University should be very careful to keep the Agreement made with Oxford concorning De∣grees. Lambeth, Dec. 26. 1639. W. Cant. CHristmas-day falling upon a Wednesday this Year, the Mayor of Ox∣ford Out of the Vice-Chancel∣lor's Letter: The Mayor's proclaiming that there should be no Market for Christmas-day. stept in before the University Clerks, and proclaim'd no Market. This he did, grounding himself (as 'tis conceived) upon the strength of Justice Jones his Arbitration. In the which (tho' altogether beside the Question) he told the Vice-Chancellor, That he thought the Market be∣long'd to the City, tho' the Government of it to the University. The Vice-Chancellor doubted not but that he should be able to right the University in this particular. Dec. 23. 1639. A. Frewen. THE Violence of the Storm on St. John's Night threw down the The Battle∣ments of the School thrown down by the Wind. From the Vice-Chan∣cellor, Jan. 6. Battlements over the Room where Your Grace's Manuscripts are billited, but did no more hurt. Fearing that the Leads might be bruised, and a passage through them for the Rain made by the fall, I caused it to be throughly search'd, and presently repair'd; so that now the Books are out of all danger. Oxford, Jan. 6. . A. Frewen. One John George, Deputy-Register to old Mr. Jones, petitioned me for a Re∣version The Register∣ship of the Vice-Chancel∣lor's Court  for by John George. The Vice-Chancellor's Information concerning Jo: George, and the having of ne'er a Table of Fees to regulate that Court. Jan. 13. of the Registership it self of the Vice-Chancellor's Court: But I refused him, and writ to the Vice-Chancellor to know the Conditions of the Man; who sent me word as follows. HEartily glad I am that your Grace hath refused this John George for having a Reversion of Mr. Jones's Office. For he is a sawcy, insolent Companion. And should he once come to enjoy the Place in his own Right, 'tis likely, would prove insufferable. What yearly Rent he pays for his Deputation, or what he is to give for the Resignation, I cannot tell. Yet thus much I know, through the greediness of the Register and Pro∣ctors, the Court begins to hear ill, nor am I able to redress it so fully as I would, there being no Table of Fees whereby to regulate them. Oxford, Jan. 13. . A. Frewen.
UPON the Vice-Chancellor's mentioning to me the having no Table of Fees for the regulating of that Court, I writ to him to draw me up one, and send it me: And that then I would consult with the Doctors of the Arches, and some well experienced Proctors, what Fees might be fittest for such a Court, and send it him back perfected, to be confirmed in Convocation, if it be thought fit. Lambeth, Jan. 17. . W. Cant. ON Saturday Jan. 25. died Mr. Robert Burton of Christ-Church, who Certain Pas∣sages out of the Vice-Chan∣cellor's Letters of Jan. 27. Mr. Burton's Legacy. A Dunce of New-Inn. hath given 5 l. per Annum for ever to the University-Library, besides a considerable Number of Books, to be taken out of his Study. And be∣cause a Benefactor to the University, I was present at his Funeral. At our last Examinations we repulsed a Dunce of New-Inn, who was not able so much as to give us a difference betwixt Quisquis and Quis{que} though a Candidate to be Master of Arts. To put an end to the Town's snarling at us for taking from them the A Division in the Town a∣bout the Ale-Houses. power of Licensing Ale-Houses, I last Week cast them out a Bone, which hath set them at odds amongst themselves. Understanding that some sold Ale without my leave, I sent out a Warrant to the Officers in every Pa∣rish. They finding by it that their Poor should reap the Fruit of their Pains, readily obey, make a strict search, inform and press to have the Penalty exacted, which hath bred a strange Distemper amongst them. and a strange one it must be, that can disjoin them (as this hath done) in their feud against the University. Here follows the Copy of the Vice-Chancellor's Warrant. THESE are to require you and every of you, immediately upon Receipt hereof The Vice-Chancellor's Warrant. to make diligent Inquiry in your Parish after all and every Person and Persons, that do take upon them to sell Ale or Beer within your said Parish, besides them whose Names are under-written. And that you do certifie me who they are, and he ready to prove and justifie their selling without License, that I may exact there∣upon the Penalty of 20s. for the use of the Poor of your Parish, from each of them so offending. Also I require you to make diligent search (taking with you a Con∣stable) what quantity of Ale or Beer the said Persons have in their several Houses, and to inform me what Brewer or Brewers have served the same: That I may pu∣nish them according to the Law. Hereof fail you not, as you will answer the con∣trary at your Perils. Given, &c. Our University Coroner being last Week to sit upon the Body of a Privileged A Privileged Person drown∣ed. Person drowned near Christ-Church, sends his Warrant, (according as the Statute directs him) to the Constable of St. Olave's to warn a Jury: He presently consults the Mayor, and the Mayor the Town-Clerk, the City Oracle, and both instruct him to disobey, because by their Charter they are exempted from all Service without their Liberties, as this Place was, though yet within the Parish of St. Olave's; which forced us for the present to send into the Country for a Jury, The Town not warning a Ju∣ry at the com∣mand of the Coroner to warn one. which lost time, and cost trouble. Of the Legality of this their Plea we here are not able to judge; yet much suspect that no Exemption in any Charter reaches to Service of this Nature: But admit it to be legal, yet was it withal uncivil, and were not the Times as they are, I should e'er long make some of them smart for it. And on Friday last I brought one of their Bailists almost upon his Knees, for fur∣nishing an unlicensed Tippling-House with Beer. And easie 'twill be for a Vice-Chancellor, if he intend to correct them at any time invenire baculum. Oxford, Jan. 27. . A. Frewen.
AT this time I writ to the Vice-Chancellor to speak to the Heads Warning gi∣ven for order∣ly Disputati∣ons this Lent. before Lent begin, and to desire them, that they would be very careful of their several Companies, that the publick Disputations then may be quick and Scholar-like, and yet without Tumult. And this I left principally upon his Care to look to, calling the Proctors to his Assistance. I received a Letter this last Week from a Reverend Bishop in this Amesius and F. Hommius, Patrons for Presbyterial Government, reprinted at Oxford. Kingdom, in which he complains that Amesius and Festus Hommius (though I think before your time) have been Reprinted in the Uni∣versity. They are professed Friends to the Presbyterial Government. And though they may Speak and Print what they please at Leyden or Amsterdam, yet methinks 'tis a great Oversight to make them Speak by our selves and our Presses, especially in the Universities. For too many Men, in these broken Times, will be apt enough to say, That we allow and approve of that Doctrine, which we Print by Licence. I pray speak with the Printers; and let them know from me, that I will not allow them to Print any Book, though it hath been Printed before, without new leave from the Vice-Chancellor for the time be∣ing. And that if they do Print any thing without such leave, I will utterly suppress them. And I pray send me word in what Year of our Lord these two Books were Printed there. Lambeth, Feb. 7. . W. Cant. ON Sunday Morn at the beginning of Sermon a Fire kindled and A Fire in Je∣sus College-Lane. brake forth in Jesus College-Lane; it threatned some great dan∣ger, being begun among so many Thatch'd Houses. But (God be praised) the greatest danger was that of the burning and pulling down two or three Thatch'd Houses, and spoiling of poor Mens Sun∣day Cloths. Oxford, Feb. 10. . Ri. Baylie. THE University and the Parish of St. Mary's are agreed for the cast∣ing St. Mary's Bell and Steeple. of their broken Bell, and the Repair of their Steeple. They are to go halfs, which comes to 40 l.

LAST Week a Scholar of Trinity College was brought home hither A Scholar of Trinity College robbed and wounded. dangerously wounded by two Theives, who betwixt Wantage and Lamborne assaulted him, and there took from him his Money, and well-nigh his Life. For wounded as he was, they left him bound fast unto a Tree, where he almost Perished before any passed that way to relieve him. Feb. 17. . A. Frewen. THERE is one Ostendorpfe, a Dutch Man, who lives at or near Ostendorpfe, a Dutch-Man, not to be in∣corporated Doctor. the Bath. He is a very Empirick, or worse. He hath taken his Degree of Doctorship at Leyden, and (as I am credibly in∣formed) hath spoken heretofore very slightly of our Universities. His Practice hath been very dangerous and rash. And now I hear for his better Countenance, he hath a purpose to be incorporated at Oxford. But, I pray, be very careful, that it be not done upon any Pretence whatsoever; for the Man certainly is an ill Deserver. Lambeth, Feb. 19. . W. Cant. I Ever entertained a very fair Opinion of this Course for Examina∣tions, The Examina∣tions again ap∣proved. as apparently conducible unto the advancement of Learning among the Younger, and the preserving the same in Masters. But, I confess, the Course did not make so deep Impression, while I barely apprehended the same, as did the solemn Executions thereof, while it was let in at mine Eyes and Ears, being the last Week present with Mr. Vice-Chancellor, and other Heads at that Exercise. The Emi∣nency of the Places for the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors at the upper end, and the like on each side for the Examiners and the Examined,
make the Exercise passing solemn, and cannot but beget an extraor∣dinary Care in the Actors on both sides, to fit themselves unto this awful Tryal. For my own part, upon fuller Consideration, I take it to be the most absolute Course that ever was devised, for the ho∣nouring of the University: This single Course giving Life to the pri∣vate Pains of Tutors, and the publick Pains of Readers, making the Auditors diligent, if they come, which is for their Advan∣tage. And if not so, but that the Private and Publick be slack, it putteth them upon a diligent search otherwise to enable themselves, as Men concern'd, either to give a good Account, or to be left to publick Shame and Obloquy. Your Grace in this one Course hath compleated all that the Founders of Colleges and Le∣ctures intended. They intended the means to make Men Scholars; Your Grace applieth this Means, and effecteth it; I doubt not but Your Grace fully comprehended this, and have had the like Expres∣sions formerly presented unto you. Yet I trust the Repetition here∣of will not be ungrateful, in as much as this my late Apprehen∣sion of this singular Benefit may infer, that the sight and hearing of this Exercise, may in like manner work upon Men in succeeding times, and cause them deservedly to bless your Memory, who have so com∣pletely provided for this University, in this very particular, as that it may for ever carry the Face and Credit of an University. Oxford, Feb. 17. . Ri. Baylie. THE two great Days after Ash-Wednesday are always left out of The Examina∣tions and the Effect of them upon Proceed∣ers. Form for Curates, School-Masters, and such like, to answer up∣on, and much the Collectors have heretofore been press'd with their Importunities, which occasioned the Horse-Fair (as we term it) on those Days for the quicker riddance of them, but no such matter this Year. On Friday last there answered but one in all, such a strange Alteration have our Examinations wrought. Of the Two hundred Batchellors, that proceed, I dare say, that One hundred and eighty are Residents in the University. Whereas heretofore we were wont to have a third part at the least out of the Country. Thus it is with us now at Lent: And I expect by so much a greater change at the Act; by how much such Outliers, as should pretend then, will have been longer absent from the University. Oxford, Feb. 24. . A. Frewen.
Right Honourable and my singular good Lord, IT was objected unto me at my late being in London, by Persons Tavern haunt∣ing and over∣much Drink∣ing again com∣plained of. of good Quality, That our Universities of England were grown to that Corruption, especially of excessive Drinking, that many did Miscarry by the Liberty and ill Example which was given them there. Insomuch, that many to avoid the Danger, did send their Sons beyond Seas for their Education. Whereunto I made answer, That the Humours of Men are such in this Age, that Innocence and Perfection it self, being in Authority, could hardly avoid Calumny. That the Times are much better than heretofore they were; And that the Fault (if there were any) did much proceed from the Pa∣rents themselves, who think it a great Disparagement to their Sons, that they should be kept within the Limits of Discipline. Notwithstanding all which, and what else may justly be re∣plied, the serious Consideration of what was objected, hath caused me so much to forget mine own Unworthiness, as by my own Pen to intimate unto Your Grace, (what I have long time wished that some other would have done,) That the Liberty of resorting to Ta∣verns, and other Drinking-Houses, and the Excess committed there is such, as may give some occasion of Scandal, being dangerous to Youth, and shameful in others, who ought to be Examples of So∣briety and Virtue. Having upon this occasion enquired into Times past, since the happy Reformation of this University, I understand by credible Information, that Dr. Pinck by his personal visiting of suspected Places, left the University, in this respect, in better state than it is at this present. For me to write how dangerous the Re∣lapse into so loathsom and general a Disease may prove, were to forget my self, and my principal Intention, which was only to make known unto You this Defect, and thereby to do Service to this Place, and in part to express my Thankfulness to Your self for the much Favour vouchsafed unto me. From Oxford, Feb. 24. . This Information I had from a Master of Art in Oxford, whom I dare trust, but will not name: Whereupon I writ to the Vice-Chancellor as follows. I Received a Letter this Week from Oxford, from an ordinary plain To the Vice-Chancel.  the . Man, but a good Scholar, and very honest. And it troubles me more than any Letter I have received many a day. 'Tis true, I have heard of late from some Men of Quality here above, that the Uni∣versity
was Relapsing into a Drinking Humour, to its great Dishonour. But, I confess, I believed it not, because I had no Intimation of it from you. But this Letter comes from a Man that can have no Ends but Honesty, and the good of that Place. And because you shall see what he writes, I send you here a Copy of his Letter, and do earnestly beg of you, That you will forthwith set your self to punish all haunting of Taverns and Ale-Houses with all the strictness that may be, that the University, now advancing in Learning, may not sink in Manners, which will shame and destroy all. I am informed too from a very good, but another, Hand, That Care to be ta∣ken of the well Ordering and Educating Young Noble∣men. there is extream Liberty given and taken by Young Noblemen and Gentlemen of the better Sort in the University: That Tutors in most Colleges do only bestow a little Pains in Reading to them, if they will come at them, but use no Power of Government over them, or any restraint; as if they had nothing to do but only to Read to them. Besides, almost all of them are suffered to keep Horses. And by that means, when they are restrain'd from Taverns, and ill Com∣pany within the University, they ride forth to the Neighbouring Places, both to Drink and perhaps to do worse. I know you can∣not be blamed for the Neglect of Tutors in private Colleges: But, I pray, at your next meeting with the Heads, let them know what I have here written, and desire their Care for Amendment, if this Report be true. But true or false, I took it my Duty to let you know what is come to my Ears from some, who are perhaps too nearly inter∣ressed in it. Lambeth, 28th. of Feb. . W. Cant. IN the Business of the Examinations, you write thus: The Vice-Chancellor's To Dr. Baylie, about the A∣buse and Let∣ter aforesaid. Successors cannot be so wanting to themselves, and the common Good, as not to pursue so fair an Example. 'Tis true, it is a very fair Example: But can it not therefore chuse but be pur∣sued by the Successors? I pray tell me! Was not Dr. Pinck's Care for suppressing the Scholars haunting of Taverns and Ale-Houses a very fair Example? Were not you and Dr. Frewen his Successors? And have you two pursued his fair Example? I have this Reason to be∣lieve you have not. I have at this present received a Letter from Oxford, from a very private, but a very honest Hand; and with an Expression full of Grief, that the University is fallen again into that Drunken Relapse, in which it swam before Dr. Pinck's Vice-Chan∣cellorship. And I assure you, it troubles me very much, because this very Week I have heard also, That some Persons of Honour and Credit have lately spoken very much concerning this Relapse: Which yet I confess I did not believe till I received this Letter, which I
cannot distrust, knowing the Man which writ to be without Spleen or Ends. And I pray God send you Governours there to take better Care, or else all my Care will be lost. Lambeth, Feb. 28. . W. Cant. THE Information given up to Your Grace against me, hath The Vice-Chancellor's Reply concern∣ing the Abuse. been long expected; yet never less than at this time. For strange it is to me, That an encrease of Drunkards should follow up∣on a decrease of Ale-Houses. Had the Informer (who e'er he be) been with me in my dirty Night Walks this Winter, and sped as ill as I have done, his Eyes would not serve him so well to espy Faults where none are boldly; I dare say it, there seldom passes one Night in a whole Week, in which one of the Proctors, or my self, do not walk the Round. And divers times I have gone (as my Ser∣vants can witness) from one end of the Town to the other, after Christ-Church Bell hath tolled, and not found one Scholar, either in the Streets, or in any of the Four Taverns. Few Hours before the Re∣ceipt One of Trinity College com∣mitted. of Your Grace's Letters, I committed one of Trinity College to Prison for Disorder in the Night; but beside him, I have not, I pro∣test, of late met with any. — Yet, not to justifie our That their drunken good Fellow∣ship, beaten by the Vice-Chancellor out of Taverns and Ale-Houses, is crept into private Colleges. selves too far, there is, I confess, too much good Fellowship amongst us; but the Informer mislays it: 'Tis driven out of Town (as others besides my self observe) into our Private Colleges and Halls. There they can, and do debauch themselves more securely, being out of the reach of the Publick Magistrate: Yea, and of their own Gover∣nours too in some Houses, the more the pity. There have indeed (for which I am heartily sorry) one or two Dis∣asters lately happened here (for seldom they come A young Kinsman of mine, Mr. . Webbe, serving the Bishop of Oxon, was the Week before-barba∣rously abused by this Hull, upon lit∣tle or no Provocation, to the en∣dangering of his Life.

Hull is in the Castle; (for as I told the Dean) I know him to be a very Disorderly Man. Others suspected to have had a hand in that Barbarous Assault are upon Bail, and so shall continue a while; though a Mes∣senger from my Lord of Oxon yesterday brought me word, that the Party hurt is in the Judgment of his Chirurgions now past danger. Oxford, March 2. . A. Frewen.
SIR, HAVING received such a Letter, as I did the former Week, I What Course to be held for present Reme∣dy of this A∣buse in Col∣leges. could not but send you a Copy of it; and I am heartily glad it hath produced such an Answer from you: For now I see clearly, that you are not in the fault, and yet that he had cause to write the Let∣ter. For though Drunkenness and open good Fellowship be not in Ta∣verns and Ale-Houses; yet it seems, since your Vigilancy hath driven them thence, they are crept into Colleges and Halls; where, by your own Acknowledgment, they do more privately, and more securely debauch one another. So the Place is changed, but not the Disorder. And the University will be undone in Reputation, if private Colleges be made the Sinks of Disorder. In this case I know not whether to turn my self; And therefore I pray let the Heads know at your next Meeting, That if they do not look to this very strictly, I must betake my self to them for these home Disorders. And if there be not pre∣sent Remedy by their Care, I will my self  the King and the State with these foul Sufferances, and not stay till Great Men (who of late begin to open their Mouths apace) complain first of these great Enormities. For my own part I have done my utmost: And I do very well understand, what hurt this may bring to the University in such Times as these. But better some hurt, than that they should be quite undone. And I pray let the Heads know how sensible I am of these foul Disorders in private, and how the Publick comes to suffer by them. I thank you heartily for making the disorderly Fellow of Trinity-College Hull to be Pu∣nish'd. an Example. And for Hull, if my Kisman miscarry, I shall then expect what the Law will do to him; but if he escape, yet I hope, the Fact being so barbarous, and (for ought I yet hear) with∣out Provocation, you will take order, when he comes out of the Castle, to send him out of the University too by Bannition. As for those which, you say, are suspected to have a hand in this foul Busi∣ness, and are now under Bail, I leave you to do to them as proof shall rise against them. But, I confess, I never heard of more than Hull in the Business, till I read it in your Letters: And the more were in it, the worse the Business, for then (it seems) the Outrage was plotted. I perceive that the Complaint which I received, concerning the Care to be ta∣ken of the Young Earl of Downe, and o∣ther Young Noblemen. Young Earl of Downe, was not causless: And how strangely soever Dr. Fulham look upon the Business, I think it had been well some re∣straint had been put upon all the Quarrellers, so far forth, as they had appeared Guilty. For Young Noblemen, when they are in the University, must be kept to a Vniversity Life in some measure, or else their Example will spoil the rest. Lambeth, March 6. . W. Cant.
MR. Justice Jones gave the Vice-Chancellor Thanks openly on Judge Jones's approbation of the Reformati∣on of the Ale∣houses. the Bench at the last Assizes, for his Care and Pains in Re∣forming the Ale-Houses. Sir Francis Windebanke and Sir John Danvers, were on Monday Burgesses for the Parlia∣ment. March 9th. Sworn Burgesses of the Parliament for the University, with an unanimous Consent of the whole House. Our Nobility here are not kept in such awe (the more is the pity) The Misgo∣vernment of Noblemens  in Oxford. as those bred up at Cambridge. And here is one Causield, an Irish Lord's Son, who both Disorders Young Cau∣field of Exeter College. himself, and misleads others: I think it would be a good Office done to the University, to have him removed hence. Oxford, March 9. . A. Frewen. I Am sorry to hear that the Noblemens Sons, which are with you, My Charge concerning this. are not kept in so good Order as they should be. And more, that it should be confessed by you, that they are not kept in so good awe, as they are at Cambridge; for, I am sure, your Statutes are perfecter than theirs, and, I dare say, you have as much careful Assistance from me in all things, as Cambridge hath from their Chancellor. And this being undeniably true, the fault must needs be among your selves: And I protest unto you, I knew nothing of any of their Li∣berty misgiven or misused, till about a Fortnight since, that I writ to you about the Young Earl of Downe, and that now you write to me about Caufield, the Son of an Irish Lord. These are therefore to pray This Message of mine was delivered by the Vice-Chan∣cellor. and require you, at your next meeting with the Heads, to let them know, that I am very much scandalized at the Liberty which is given to these Young Men; and to require of them in whose Colleges or Halls any Noblemens Sons are, First, That they be as carefully held to all manner of Exercise, which they are able to perform, as any other whatsoever: And, Secondly, That they be kept in Obedience to all the Statutes within the several Houses respectively, as I hope your self will take care for their Observation of the Statutes of the Uni∣versity. 'Tis true, I would have a difference put between Noblemens Sons and others of meaner Condition; but that should be in an Honourable Usage of them, not in giving them any Liberty at their own hurt, and the Dishonour of the University. Now whether you will send for all these Young Men to the meeting of the Heads, that they may know what Charge I have given concerning them, I leave to your self, and that which you shall judge fittest upon the place. But I would have Young Caufield called, and his Tutour, and there
let it be told unto them, and the Head of the House in which he is, that if he mend not his Manners, he shall not stay there to corrupt others. And I do hereby require of you and them, That either they keep him in better Order, or presently send him away to his Friends: I have written to the Dean by this days Car∣rier. And if they do not do the one or the other, either you shall banish him the University, or I will. And to this end, I pray, send me up the Form of a Bannition to lie by me, and Caufield's Christian Name, that I may begin with him, if there be cause. And for the Young The Young Earl hath left the University. Earl of Downe, I have written to Dr. Fell to look better to him, or I will make him an Example also, let his Friends take it as they please. Lambeth, March 13. . W. Cant. MR. Sympson, a Senior Fellow of Trinity College, is by the Statutes The Degree of Doctorship de∣nied to Mr. Sympson of Tri∣nity Colleges of that House urged to proceed Doctor; or to resign. Their Visitor (as Doctor Potter tells me) hath herein been consulted, who finds only this way to relieve him, by having his Grace denied him in the University, their being a Clause in their Statute to that pur∣purpose, which I have seen. Hereupon they beg a Repulse of me, and shall grant it, if Your Grace think well of it. The Party is I gave way to the . poor, and so likely to draw more Disrepute on the Degree, than it can bring Honour to him. March 23. . A. Frewen. SIR, I Am inform'd there is an express Mulct set down in the Statute for The Proctors yearly to Ac∣compt for the  due to the University; from such Re∣gents as neg∣lect the Duties of their Re∣gency. each Regent to pay, that hath forfeited his Cautions in not ful∣filling the Duties belonging to his Regency, which are creating Ge∣nerals, moderating Quodlibets, examining of Candidates, and the like. These Mulcts (as far as I remember) are to be gathered by the Pro∣ctors, and all or some part of them to be accounted for by them to your self and the Delegates at the end of their Office. I do not re∣member that these Duties have been so well accounted for to the University as they ought to be; which as it is some Loss to that Body, so it is a great Encouragement to the Regents to be slack and careless in the Performance of all those Duties which belong unto them. Whereas, were they strictly called to an Account for them, you should have a far greater performance of all Duties than now
there is. These are therefore to pray and require you forthwith to acquaint the Proctors with what I have here written; and to require The  were startled at this Message, not looking for such an after-Reckoning. Dr. Frewen, March 30. them in my Name, That at their Accompts they present unto you before the Delegates a List subscribed by their Hands, of all such as have forfeited to the University any part of their Cautions, in not fulfilling the Duties aforesaid of their Regency. And farther, I think it fit, that you acquaint the Heads with this Business at your next Meeting, because I do not intend to lay this as a burthen upon the present Proctors only, (whose Diligence perhaps may have been as great as others before them) but do require that notice be taken, That I will have a strict Account of these things given up by all Proctors successively at the end of their Year. And you shall do well to let the succeeding Proctors know so much at the beginning of theirs. And I pray fail not to give me an Account of this Business. Lambeth, March 27. 1640. W. Cant. OUR Lent-Disputations are now (God be thanked) happily Lent-Dispn∣tations passed quietly. The Examina∣tions the cause of it. ended, without any the least Tumult or Disorder at any time. And this I cannot but impute principally to our Examinations, as one of the many good Fruits that spring from them. No Dunce can now invade the Degree; and about such heretofore our School Quar∣rels ever began. March 30. 1640 A. Frewen. BEING to begin my Journey this Day, last Night I walked round No Scholars found stirring in the Night, or at Taverns. the Town; when (though in the Streets the best part of the Night) though in all Quarters of the Town, at all Taverns, and many other Tippling-Houses besides, yet not in all that time, nor in any of these Places, did I meet with one Scholar, but returned home again with loss of my Labour, whereof I was heartily glad. The truth hereof I protest upon the Word of a Priest. Nor do I write this to boast of my own Diligence, but to furnish Your Grace with what to Answer, Procuratores, Mr. Allibond, è . Lincoln; Mr. Greaves, è Coll. Om. Ani∣marum. if need require, in this busie and inquisitive Time. Oxford, April 20. 1640. A. Frewen.
THE Vice-Chancellor having occasion of a Fortnight's Absence The Examina∣tions at a dead stand revived: from the University, found at his coming home the Examina∣tions at a dead stand, but he presently revived them again. And I sent him word, that by this it appeared to me that that great Busi∣ness would quickly fall to nothing, if the Vice-Chancellors for the fu∣ture did not take that prudent and vigilant Care, with which the pre∣sent Vice-Chancellor had setled it. Lambeth, May 14. 1640. W. Cant. I Am sorry that the Order of the Regents hath been any way di∣sturb'd Concerning the Examina∣tions. in relation to the Examinations; and I pray set it as right again as you can, before you leave your Office, that your Successors, by your Example and Instructions, may go on the next Year with the more Chearfulness and better Success. Lambeth, May 22. 1640. W. Cant. FOR Dr. Jackson's Sermons, if they offend against His Majesty's Dr. Jackson's Sermons, if they offend a∣gainst his Ma∣jesty's Declara∣tion, &c: Declaration, you must contrive the handsomest way you can for some delay: For certainly this is no time to Publish any thing that may give Offence, as that will certainly do, if it be so expresly a∣gainst His Majesty's Declaration as you write. And you cannot but see what snatching there is at my self, and that Vniversity. And if Dr. Jackson be not satisfied with such Excuses as you can make, then you shall do well to tell him, that I have lately written to you, that both in regard of the Duty which we owe to His Majesty, and the Peace of the Church, no Man should presume to Print any thing there which might break the Rule given in His Majesty's Declaration one way or other. And this I pray be very careful to observe, not only in the Person of Dr. Jackson, but of all Men else. Lambeth, May 22. 1640. W. Cant.
WE have an Inn in the High Street, called the Miter, which is Greene, a  Inn-Keep∣er at the Miter in Oxford. the general Rendezvouz of all the Recusants, not in this Shire only, but in the whole Kingdom, that have any Business to Oxford. Seldom are they there without some Scholars in their Company, up∣on pretence either of Alliance or Acquaintance, which have ever pas∣sed for warrantable Excuses at seasonable Hours. What they do there I cannot say; but yet the Concourse thither being great, and the Host a profess'd Papist, I somewhat doubt that the University may both hear ill for it, and suffer by it in the perversion of some of our Youth, if there be not some Course taken for prevention. Greene, the Host, is not of our Body, but a Townsman, and Licensed by them to keep an Inn: And his House hath a Back Gate towards Lincoln-College, where most of the Guests privately enter, and is near Neigh∣boured by many Recusants; there being, as I am informed, more of them in that little Parish of Allhallows (where his House stands) than in any two besides. I only give Your Grace the naked Relation, leaving it wholly to Your Wisdom to do what You shall think fittest. Oxon, June 1. 1640. A. Frewen. I Do not remember that ever I heard of Greene your Inn-Keeper by My Answer to the foresaid Passage. Allhallows-Church, either that he was a Recusant, or that there is such resort of Recusants to his House, not only out of that Shire, but from other Shires also, that have any Business to Oxford. And I like it much the worse, because there is such a private Back Way to the Inn as you mention; and were the Town as careful as they ought to be, they would not have Licensed such a Man to be an Inn-Keeper there. But since they take so little Care, I'll take the more. In my power it is not to discharge him from his Inn, but for the better Discharge of my own Duty, I have complained to the Lords about him. And I hope there will a Letter go from the Board to the Town to call for an Account of the whole Business. You need not take any notice of this, neither shall the Letters go as if you had given the Information: But I purpose to follow it close till all be done which may be done by Law. Lambeth, June 8. 1640. W. Cant.

THE Disputations in Quodlibets were, I confess, somewhat dis∣ordered Disputations in Quodlibets. the last Term, by reason of that Beadle's absence, to whom by Statute it solely belongs to warn the Regents in their Course. But now all goes on methodically again, according to Your Grace's desire. Oxon, June 8. 1640. A. Frewen. ON Monday last I convented the two Carriers before the Heads: The Oxford Carriers not to Travel with a∣bove six Hor∣ses, &c. And there to prevent future Clamour from the Country, en∣joined them not to Travel with above Six Horses in a Wagon, and to begin on this day Seven Night. W. Cant. I Like the Course very well which you have begun with your Car∣riers, to prevent the Clamour of the Country; for indeed the use of Carts with four Wheels cannot make such a spoil of the Highway as is made usually, if they do not overload them. And the extreme overloading of them is ventured on, because they may use as many Horses as they please. I am sorry to hear so many Soldiers take Oxford in their way; but Soldiers pas∣sing through the Town, and mutinying in their Drink. glad withal that you keep the Scholars so well from them, that all Disorders may be prevented, as you write they have hitherto been.

His wide-sleev'd Gown, Hat and Band lay on the Bank, but the rest of his Cloaths were upon him, which makes us much suspect that he wilfully cast away himself. The Crowners Inquest hath found him not Mentis compotem. And I hear from good Hands that he was much troubled in Mind, for which reason at the opening of his Study I mean to observe what Books he used most, Oxford, June 22. 1640. A. Frewen. ON June the 25th. 1640. I sent by Dr. Baylie, Dean of Sarum, The Arabick-Lecture settled for ever. and President of St. John Baptist's-College, the Conveyances for the perpetual Settling of the Arabick Lecture in Oxford, and the Sta∣tutes which I made for the due reading of it, and desired that those Statutes might by the Vice-Chancellor's care be transcribed into the Original Statute-Book, and the Conveyances also, according as he finds done with other Lectures given by other Benefactors to the Univer∣sity. As also for the transcribing of these Statutes into all other Sta∣tute-Books of the University respectively, that those which are bound to be Auditors, may know both their Times and their Duties. These Directions I sent by Dr. Baylie, but sent no Letter at this time to the the University, because of the hast which I made to have the Busi∣ness done, and to he out of my Hands in these broken Times, which gave me no leisure at all from more Publick Affairs to write unto them. As for the Evidences which belong to this Land, they are all in the Custody of the Town of Redding; to which Town I gave all my Land lying in Bray in Berkshire, of which this to the Arabick Lecture is not a full fifth part, and could not dismember the Evi∣dences; and therefore thought it fittest to leave them there, where
part of the Land was settled to other charitable Uses.  I have made the Vice-Chancellor for the time being, with some  Heads of Colleges, perpetual Visitors of that which I have done  : A Counterpart whereof remains in the Custody of the  and Fellows of St. John Baptist's College, of all which I gave  present Vice-Chancellor an Account: June 25th. 1640. W. Cant. Right Honourable, YOUR Letters of the Seventh of this June with all Humility The Mayor of Oxford's Letter to the Lords about Greene's Inn, with a Complaint a∣gainst the Uni∣versity, for in∣vading the Town Privi∣leges. we have received: And according to Your Lordships Commands therein, we have diligently enquired and informed our selves, and do find that some Guests, being Recusants, do resort to the Inn called the Miter, and that Greene named in Your Lordship's Letter, was pre∣sented at the last Sessions for a Popish Recusant; but not many Years since he was one of our Serjeants, and did then frequent the Church: And we finding that he Marrying the late Inn-holder's Widow of the said Inn, became Owner thereof during the Minority of his Son-in-Law; and by that means, it being an ancient Inn of the Inheritance of Lincoln-College, he keepeth the same Inn. And touching the Authority and Licensing the said Greene so to do, His Majesty's Letters were lately procured and sent to us, that we should not meddle in the Licensing of any Person to keep Ale-Houses, or Victualling-Houses, but that we should leave the same to the Vice-Chancellor and the Ju∣stices that were Members of the University. And under pretence of that Letter, when we in Obedience to His Majesty's Proclamation, and his Highness's Writ directed to us for the observing of Lent, at the beginning of the last Lent did by Warrant Summon the Victu∣allers of our own Body only to become bound to His Majesty accord∣ing to the said Proclamation, the Vice-Chancellor sent his Beadles to the Mayor, to tell him that the binding of Victuallers did belong to the Vice-Chancellor, and not to the Mayor: And thereupon the Vice-Chancellor presently made a Warrant to call all the Victuallers before him at another Place, one Hour before the time appointed in the Mayor's Warrant. And amongst others did take a Recognizance of the said Greene, but never certified the same Recognizance, not any other Recognizances to the Sessions according to the Law. And we make bold to certifie Your Lordships. That we have only the Name of Mayor and Magistrates, but the Vice-Chancellor, Doctors, and Proctors do interpose in the Town Affairs: That all our Liberties and Privileges are much lessened; that of late we had much ado to get Mayor and Bailiffs (there being so many that paid their Fines
to refuse) that the City was at last forced to refuse their Fines, and to compel them to take upon them the same Offices. Whereas here∣tofore when we enjoy'd our Liberties and Privileges, the same Places were much desired. And so hoping that, the Premisses considered, Your Lordships will not conceive us so careless therein, as in Your Lordships Letters is express'd, we humbly take leave, resting at Your Lordships Service. Oxon, 15 Junii, 1640. John Smith, Mayor. William Potter, Aldermen. John Sare, Aldermen. Henry Southam, Aldermen. Thomas Cooper, Aldermen. May it please Your good Lordship, ACcording to the Statute of Winchester, in the Thirteenth Year of The Mayor of Oxford's Letter to the Earl of Berks, their Steward, to shew to the Lords touch∣ing their Night Watch. the Reign of our late Sovereign Lord King Edward the First, and according to certain Orders and Directions publish'd by the Body of his Highness Privy-Council, 1630. A Watch was set by Mr. Mayor and his Brethren, with the Consent of the Vice-Chancellor (these Rebellious times requiring the same) part of which Watch, by reason of divers Inrodes and Inlets (besides the Gates of the City) were ap∣pointed by Mr. Mayor to walk about their several Wards and Liberties for the Safety thereof, and good Order; by which Watch straggling Soldiers and others have been taken, and we have been safe. But Mr. Proctors question the said Watch, and exact of them 40 s. a time for such their walking: And for Non-payment thereof threaten to sue them in the Vice-chancellor's Court, and send for these Watch-Men very often to their Chambers, and make them attend them there, and have imprison'd some of the Constables, and have laid hold of the Watch-Men, and taken some of them to the Prison Gates with an intent to Imprison them; and do say, that Mr. Mayor can∣not give them Power to go from the Gates of the said City. And for these Causes Mr. Mayor is forced to discharge the Watch; but the Watch in St. Thomas Parish (being the Entrance from Farrington, where the late Rebellion was) he did not discharge, and the last Night Proctor Allibond Imprisoned the Constable for setting the same Watch. All this we will prove to be true upon Oath, if it be deni∣ed: And therefore our humble Suit to Your Lordship is, That by Your good furtherance we may receive the Opinion of the Honou∣rable Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council, what shall be done in the Premisses; And whether Mr. Mayor shall be freed of all Danger for not setting a Watch in these troublesom Times or not. And so
craving Pardon for our so often troubling You, we remember our Humble Service to Your Lordship, and render many Thanks, always remaining Oxon, June 24. 1640. Your Lordship's to be commanded, John Smith, Mayor. William Potter, John Nixon, Thomas Smith, Leo. Bowman, John Sare, William Charles, Humphrey Whistler, Henry Southam, Martin Wright, Roger Griffin. Walter Cave, Bailiffs. William Poole, Bailiffs. SIR, THE Mayor of Oxford hath lately sent these two Letters above My Letters to the Vice-Chan∣cellor, touch∣ing these two Letters of the Mayor. written, one to the Lords of the Council, and the other to the Earl of Berks, to shew to the Lords. And I here send you the Co∣pies of them both. The Letter to the Lords is most concerning Greene and his Inn; in which I do desire you to make a clear and di∣stinct Answer to these Particulars following. As First, Whether this Inn be the Inheritance of Lincoln-College; and whether Greene is pos∣sessed of it by the Marriage of the Widow in the Right of his Son∣in-Law. And this the rather, because your first Information said, That the Town authorized him to keep this Inn. Secondly, You may see by this how angry they are about their Victuallers, where they directly charge you, That amongst others you took a Recognizance of the said Greene, but never certified the said Recognizance nor any other to the Sessions according to the Law: To which also it will be fit you give Answer. Thirdly, They say they have only the Name of Mayor and Magistrates; and speak in all the rest of their Letter, as if all the Town Privileges were invaded by the University. And here I would have you answer two things. The one, That they offer to invade the University Privileges, which I conceive is true. And the other, Whether so many as they mention did refuse the Offices of Mayor and Bailiffs this last Year. Their second Letter is only concerning their Night-Watch; in which I think there is a manifest invading of the Vniversity Privi∣lege: And Proctor Allibond is challenged by Name. But they have taken a very cunning rise for their Business; for they put it all upon their Care for a Watch, by reason of the Seditious Tumult at Far∣rington. There is great reason that Mr. Mayor should be freed from
all Danger about setting of a Watch, save only such as is his Duty to set; but the Lords will not give me their Opinion, till they have an Answer from the University how the Mayor's Watch and the Uni∣versity Privileges stand together. I pray therefore send a full An∣swer to this Particular especially. But I pray send your whole An∣swer in such fair Terms, as that I may shew it whole and entire to the Lords; but let the matter be as full home as you can. Lambeth, July 3. 1640. W. Cant. Most Reverend, IN the Name of the whole University, as well as in my own, I re∣turn The Vice-Chancellor's Answer to the two Letters of the Mayor of Oxford. Your Grace humble Thanks for the Notice which by Your last Letter You have been pleased to give me of a late Information preferred by this Town unto the Lords of the Council against us. To the several Branches whereof I will make bold to return a brief Answer, that it may the more fully appear unto Your Grace, how false in some, and groundless in all Particulars, the Complaint is. 'Tis true, That Green's House belongs to Lincoln-College, and that he now enjoys it by the Right of his Wife: But this makes it not to be an Inn, that must be done by License, which he must either have from the Town (as all other Inns as yet have) or else he hath none. For, confident I am that he hath not any from the Vniversity. By Virtue of His Majesty's late gracious Grant unto us, we License Ale-House-Keepers and Victuallers. Above which Rank (until better inform∣ed now by the Town) we conceived Inn-holders to be, and therefore meddled not with them. If Greene came in the throng at the begin∣ning of Lent to be bound by me from dressing of Flesh (the which I remember not) he came not called. For by my Warrant I then Summoned none but Privileged Persons, and such only of the Town as by the Power given the University by His Majesty had been al∣lowed by us. The Recognizance of those  Licensed, I confess, I returned not to the Quarter-Sessions, and that for this Reason: His Majesty by the fore-mention'd Letter was pleased to grant us the same Authority over Ale-Houses and Victuallers, which the University of Cambridge hath. No Recognizances are returned there: (whereof I am certain, for I sent thither purposely in November last to enquire.) And there∣fore none by us. The University there keeps them in its own Pow∣er, and so do we. The Town-Clerk (who Pen'd the Letter) does, I grant, by this means lose some petty Fees, which (the Poor Men now save in their Purses) he formerly had, whilest the power of
Licensing was in them. But this is a very weak Plea in a Business of such Consequence. Nor indeed are those Fees now considerable, we having already reduced those Ale-Houses to Five Score, which before were Three Hundred. A great number: And yet not to be marvelled at, when one Man, this Mayor's Father-in-Law, Bosworth a Brewer and Justice of the Town, was (as I have credibly been informed) in a very short time, the means of Licensing an Hundred for his part; upon Conditions (which tied them faster than their Recognizance to the King) that they should take all their Beer of him; nor did he stand single: Others they have who trod after him in the very same steps; which makes me wonder with what Face they can complain of the Loss of a Power which they so grosly abused. And yet more, I marvel at their Complaint against us for invading their Liberties, when themselves are so notoriously guilty of daily At∣tempts upon ours, without any colour at all of Right for their so doing. Witness their Intrusion into the Office of Clerk of the Market: Their Enquiries at their Leets touching the Cleansing and Paving of the Streets: Their refusing to be regulated by the Vice-Chancellor (as heretofore) touching the Price of their Candles: Arresting and Suing of Privileged Persons in their City Court: Taking of Felons Goods, and interrupting our Proctors in their Night Walk. Nor can I amongst these Grievances omit their present multiplying of Cottages, and Inmates in all Parts of the Town, in despight of the Inhibition to the contrary sent unto them by Letters from the Lords of the Council; whereof they have in a friendly manner been put in mind by the University, both at their Publick Sessions, and at other times. If the Mayors of Oxford have now (as is pretended) only the Title, not the Authority of the Place, they are the more to be bla∣med for being so ambitious of it: I presume Your Grace hath heard of the violent and drunken Competition that was between a Brewer and Baker at Michaelmas was Twelve Month; how many Days, and how much Beer was spent in the Canvass, to the no small Scandal of this Place, and disparagement of the Office, which was to be pro∣cured by such unworthy Means. In the issue the Brewer prevailed, and his Beer wrought so well with the Commoners the whole Year after, that by the strength thereof his Brother (the present Mayor) came to succeed him in the Place; That none either then or since have Fined for refusing the Office, either of Mayor or Bailiffs, though in their Letter they seem to pretend the contrary. The Mayor pretending the Statute of Edward the First for his Night-Watch, I did not oppose it; though I saw little use of it here, and knew this Place to be exempt by an Act Eliz. 13. which confirms all our Charters unto us, notwithstanding any Acts of Parliament what∣soever. That Statute appoints the Watch to stand at the Gates; where had they kept themselves, the Proctors had not questioned them. But when they took the boldness to walk the Streets to exa∣mine Scholars of all Conditions, to enter Houses, and search what
Company there, then they thought it high time to appear, and stand up in defence of their own Authority, and the Privilege of the University. Your Grace, having been Proctor long since, cannot but know that the Night Watch hath of old belonged to the University, and was so confirmed unto us, as our Right by the Lords, at an hear∣ing before them 'twixt the University and Town, 1612. Jacobi De∣cimo. Nor since then have the Townsmen disturb'd it at any time be∣fore now, when our unwillingness to trouble either Your Grace or the Lords of the Council with petty Complaints in these busie Times, hath so heartned them, that nothing will now satisfie them, unless they may trample our Charters under their Feet, and give Laws to them by whom they live. For the particular Passage 'twixt one of the Proctors and the Constable of St. Thomas Parish I am a Stranger, and therefore have sent Your Grace the sum of it under the Proctor's own Hand. A second Reason (omitted before through hast) for my not bring∣ing to the Quarter Sessions the Recognizances which I have taken of Victuallers and Ale-Houses, is this; because His Majesty hath by our Charter given to the University all the Fines, Amercements and Pro∣fits that accrue from them. Since I began to write, Greene hath been asked, and he makes Answer, That he keeps his Inn by virtue of a Licence from the Town; but an ancient one it is. Oxon, July 6. 1640. A. Frewen. WHereas it hath been suggested by Mr. Mayor of Oxon to the Proctor Alli∣bond's Answer to that which concerns him in the Mayor of Oxon's Let∣ter. Lord's of His Majesty's most Honourable Privy-Council, That I committed the Constable of St. Thomas Parish for setting his Watch, it is my humble Suit that the Honourable Board will be pleased to take notice, that he was committed for these Reasons following: First, For taking upon him (to the great Prejudice of the Privi∣vileges of the University) the Search of Houses. A thing not be∣longing to the Officers of the Town, but in Cases of Treason and Felony. Secondly, For an Outrage committed by his Watch upon one Wallis in his own Lodging; he himself being at the same time at the Door. Thirdly, For doing and suffering these things beyond the bound of his Walk.
For these Reasons above specified, I committed him to the Castle, yet so as a Delinquent, not as a Constable, I not being able to know his Office by his bare word without his Mace. Oxon, July 6. 1640. Peter Allibond, Proctor of the University of Oxon.

THERE was a Warrant respectively sent to the Vice-Chancellor The Council's Warrant for the Vice-Chan∣cellor and the Mayor. and the Mayor of Oxford, dated July the 10th. to require both of them, and the Proctor Allibond, to appear before the Lords of the Council the 22th. of this present July, to make Proof of what was alledged on either side against each other in the former Letters. Berkshire Soldiers, who were upon their March as far as Brackley, Berkshire Sol∣diers. recoyled back upon us yesterday, and were last Night our unwelcome Guests. Their Captains have been with me for Assistance according to the Proclamation, and are now busie in calling their scatter'd Forces together again. Oxford, Wednesday the 15th. of July, 1640. A. Frewen. At Whitehall the 22th. of July, 1640. The Order of the Council concerning the difference be∣tween the Vice-Chancellor and the Mayor. PRESENT The KING's MAJESTY. Lord Arch-Bishop of Cant. Lord Keeper, Lord Treasurer, Lord Privy Seal, Lord Duke of Lenox. Lord Marquis Hamilton. Lord Admiral, Earl of Berks, Earl of Holland, Earl of Traquare, Lord Goring, Lord Cottington, Mr. Treasurer, Mr. Secretary Windebanke, Sir Tho. Rowe. WHereas His Majesty (being present at the Board) did this day hear the Complaints of the Mayor, Recorder, and others of the City of Oxford expressed in two Letters, the one of the 15th of June to the Board, the other of the 4th. of June to the Earl of Berks, a Member of the Board, concerning their Liberties, in the Pre∣sence of the Vice-Chancellor, and other Doctors of the University, and Mr. Allibond, one of the Proctors, whom the said Complaint did concern.
After mature Debate it was ordered, That the University of Ox∣ford, according to his Majesty's Gracious Letter, shall have the sole Licensing of Victualling-Houses in that City and Suburbs, in like man∣ner as the University of Cambridge hath in the Town of Cambridge: And for that purpose it is ordered by His Majesty, with advice of the Board, That the Commission for the Peace in Oxford shall be renew∣ed, and the Vice-Chancellor only made of the Quorum. Secondly, for the Complaint of the Building of Cottages, it is ordered, That the Vice-Chancellor and the Mayor shall make several Certificates of all the new Cottages built within Twenty Years, and shall distin∣guish which of them have been built by Privileged Persons upon Col∣lege Lands, and which by Townsmen, and which by Privileged Per∣sons upon the Town Wast by their leave: Upon return of which Cer∣ficates their Lordships will give such farther Order therein as shall be fit. Thirdly, it was order'd, That his Majesty's Attorney and Sol∣licitor-General shall examine how the Orders, set down by Mr. Ju∣stice Jones for preventing of Disputes and Controversies between the University and City of Oxford, have been observed, and by whom there hath been any defailer therein admitted. Upon Certificate whereof their Lordships will take such Order as shall be fit for the due Observance of the same. Fourthly, it was ordered, That according to the Statute of Winchester, those to whom it belongeth ought to set Watches at the Gates of the City, according to the said Statute; and that the said Watch continue there, without walking of the Streets, or moving from their Station, except it be for the suppressing of any sudden Tumult, or other Malefactors, whereof there is not time to give notice to the Vice-Chancellor and the Proctors of the said Univer∣sity. Lastly, it is ordered, That the Constable committed to Prison shall be delivered, but not without paying of Fees. After my hearty Commendations, DR. Frewen hath now born the troublesom Office of the Vice-Chan∣cellorship Dr. Potter chosen my Vice-Chan∣cellor. of that University for the space of two whole Years, which is the time now usually given to execute that Office: And is certainly weight enough for any Man to bear so long. In the discharge of this Office he hath through the whole course of his time carried himself with great Care, Moderation and Prudence; and that as well in all Businesses which relate to the Town, as in those which look more immediately upon the University. And among other great Services perform'd by him, I cannot forbear to single out one, and here publickly to give him Thanks for it, even above the rest: And that is the great Pains he hath taken, and the singular Dexte∣rity which he hath used in bringing the Statutes concerning the Exa∣minations into Use and Settlement. Which Statute, I dare be bold to say, being continued and kept up in the same Vigour to which it is now raised by his Care and Providence, will be of such singular use
as that, for my part, I cannot easily tell whether it will be greater Honour or Benefit to that University; but sure I am, it will be the one by the other, if it be kept up to the Life, as I hope it shall be. Dr. Frewen's time being thus happily spent both for his own Ho∣nour, and the University's Good, the Care now lies upon me to name another, to take up that Burthen which he lays down, and to go in those steps which he hath trod out before him. And I thank God for it, there is such Choice of able Men in that Place for this Service, that I cannot be to seek whom to name unto it. But I have for the present thought upon Dr. Potter, Dean of Worcester, and Provost of Queen's-College, as a Man whom I know to be of great Integrity and Sufficiency for that Place, and of whose Care and Industry there∣in I am very confident. To him, together with the Office, I do more especially recommend the Care of the Examinations in point of Learning, and a most strict Watchfulness and Observance against all haunting of Taverns or any other Meetings, private or publick, which may any way help to suppress the base Sin of Drunkenness, the Mo∣ther or the Nurse of almost all other Distempers, which may bring Obloquy upon that Place. These are therefore to let you know, that I do hereby nominate and chuse Dr. Potter to be my Vice-Chancellor for this Year ensuing: And do hereby pray and require you to allow of this my Choice, and to give him all due Respect and Assistance in all things necessary for that Government, and more especially in the two Particulars above-named; that so Sobriety and good Manners as well as Learning may flourish in that Place. And thus not doubting of your readiness and willing Obedience herein, I leave both him and you to the Grace of God, and rest Lambeth, July 24. 1640. Your Loving Friend and Chancellor, W. Cant. AND for the future, I pray, let not the Town so much as begin Concerning Cottages. to lay the Foundation of any Cottage or any other House what∣soever in any Place, but send me word of it presently, that I may ac∣quaint the Lords with it, and command a stay. August 3. 1640. W. Cant.
UPON a late Warrant from the Deputy-Lieutenants the Mayor Another Breach of the Town's upon the Universi∣ty's Privilege, by taxing Coat and Conduct-Money upon Privileged Per∣sons, yea and upon some Do∣ctors of Phy∣sick. hath freshly pressed and set out ten new Soldiers. Coat and Con∣duct-Money for these in their several Parishes was taxed upon all Pri∣vileged Persons, not only Stationers, Apothecaries, that trade and use Merchandize (who are more liable) but upon Doctors, Clayton, Sanders, Bambridge, and all Physicians, upon Mr. Crosse our Beadle, on our Butlers, Manciples, Cooks, who are our immediate Servants, and deal not with any Trade. All profess themselves very willing to advance His Majesty's Service, especially in these base and broken Times. Yet they hope, by your Grace's Favour, to enjoy the benefit of that Privilege which, being anciently granted to our University, was of late confirmed by His Majesty's Charter, and is enjoy'd by the other University. At my intreaty all of them in a manner have paid; but their humble Suit unto Your Grace is, That hereafter their now Rea∣diness may not prejudice them, nor be drawn into Consequence. Oxford, Aug. 4. 1640. Chr. Potter. UPON the Death of Young Devall, whom I made Toll-gatherer James Penne nominated Toll-gatherer in Oxford, Sept. 4. in Oxford after his Father, I nominated James Penne, Manciple of St. John Baptist College to succeed him. This I did by the Advice of the Vice-Chancellor and some Heads, who thought him a very fit Person for that Place. And I farther order'd, That out of the Pro∣fits of the Place he should allow the Poor Widow of old Devall Year∣ly Ten Pounds. September 4. 1640. W. Cant. UPON Sunday last being Sept. 6. there were two Seditious Sermons Two Seditious Sermons by Mr. Johnson and Mr. Wil∣kinson. Preach'd at St. Mary's: The one in the Morning by Mr. John∣son of Magdalen-College, which was concerning Vniversal Grace, and contrary to His Majesty's Declaration in that behalf. The other in the Afternoon in a very bitter way against some Ceremonies of the Church, by Mr.  of Magdalen-Hall. The Vice-Chancellor gave me notice of these by his Letters of September 7th. with a Promise, that he would see them both Censured; and I writ back unto him that he should not fail to see it done, according to either of their Faults re∣spectively. Sept. 11. 1640. W. Cant.
THE Vice-Chancellor sends me farther word in his Letters of September 14th, That Wilkinson's Sermon was very Base and Fa∣ctious, and merely intended to make a Party for the Scots. Sept. 14. 1640. W. Cant. THE Vice-Chancellor according to this my Direction convented The Recanta∣tion enjoin'd to Mr. Johnson. both the Delinquents before the Heads; and, with their Con∣sent, enjoined them to submit, and make the Retractations follow∣ing, viz. Whereas I John Johnson, Fellow of Magdalen College, preaching at St. Mary's upon Sunday September 6th in the Forenoon, did unadvised∣ly throughout my Sermon insist upon the Proof of Vniversal Re∣demption and Vniversal Grace, not without some bitterness against the contrary Opinions, hereby disobeying the Declaration and Command of His Majesty, to the Disturbance of the Peace of the Church and of the University, I do hereby acknowledge my Offence, and my Sor∣row for it, humbly desiring, that this my Acknowledgment may be accepted: And I do promise for the time to come to conform my self in all humble Obedience to his His Majesty's said Declaration, and al∣ways to prefer the publick Quiet and Peace of the Church before any doubtful and disputable Opinion of mine own. Whereas I Henry Wilkinson, of Magdalen-Hall, preaching at Mr. Wilkinson's Recantation refused. St. Mary's upon Sunday September 6th in the Afternoon, did in several Passages of my Sermon uncharitably and indiscreetly glance at my Superiors, and other conformable Members of the Church of England, as at Men luke-warm and wanting Zeal, and inclining to favour Ro∣mish Superstitions and antient Heresies; and also did indirectly accuse the present Condition of this Church, as if it never fared worse with good Men, and as if Goodness were discountenanced, discouraged, and punished, &c. I do hereby unfeignedly confess my Errour, and my Sorrow for it: And I do also promise ever hereafter, both in my Sermons and Discourses in publick and in private, to carry my self with all Obedience and Conformity to the Publick Government, be∣ing careful to give no just Offence or Scandal to the Church, or my Superiours. Upon the tender of these two Submissions Johnson recanted accord∣ing Wilkinson su∣spended. to the Form, and so was dismissed; but Wilkinson obstinately refused, and so was suspended from all execution of this Priestly Fun∣ction within the University and Precincts thereof, according to the Statute, (Coram Praefectis) September 4th.
I am not willing by an over-strictness to fasten discouragement up-Desert; A Son of Dr. Fell's dispen∣sed with for one Term to proceed Bat∣chelor of Arts. and yet I cannot but fear on the other side what a loose hand may work, by giving an easie way to Dispensations: Therefore in this Case if the Young Youth of Christ-Church, whom you men∣tion, be of such known Desert, and that he wants but one Term, I shall leave him to your self and the Heads: Yet with my earnest and hearty desire, That you be very careful in all Dispensations. And I pray, now Term is beginning, be as careful for the upholding of all Exercises, and all Discipline there; and especially the Examinations and the Manners of the Younger Sort. For if any thing prove to be amiss in these broken Times, both you and I shall be sure to hear of it, and perhaps where we would not. Lambeth, October 7. 1640. W. Cant. SIR, IN the end of Dr. Frewen's second Year, he had observed how in Examinations to prevent Col∣lusion in them. A Branch of my Letters to the Vice-Chan∣cellor. the great and useful Business of the Examinations of Proceeders, there might be a Collusion; (though as yet he thought it was never practised:) He sent me word of it, and withal proposed this way of Remedy. The Collusion, which he feared might be, was by plot∣ting before-hand between the Examinants and the Candidates, which by which should be examined, and consequently each Candidate might easily know upon what Questions he should be examined, and provide accordingly. The Remedy which he proposed against this was, (and he practised it the last Term of his Office,) That the Candidates should be examined in such Order as the Prector should rank them in a Paper to be set up over the Seat (where the Examinants sit in the School) every day immediately before the Exercise begins. By this means the Candidates being uncertain where they should pitch, must either tamper with all three Examiners, or run a very great hazard of missing their end, if they should apply themselves but to one only. This Remedy I did then approve, and your Predecessor put it in pra∣ctice. And I desire you heartily to speak with him about it, and to pursue it with all Care and Diligence; and not to suffer that Exer∣cise, which will bring so much present Honour to the University, and so much future Benefit to the Church, either to  or to be abused by any Collusion whatsoever. Lambeth, October 16. 1640. W. Cant.
THE last Week I was present, and both the Proctors, at both the The Vice∣chancellor's Answer to this Passage about the Examina∣tions. Days of Examinations. The School was full; and the Inven∣tion will be of singular use for the encouragement of Studies, the honour of Learning, and the discountenancing of Ignorance. So that now the Church is more like to flourish with Peace, as well as Learning, when it shall be freed from those ignorant bold Bayerds, which first break into it by Symony, and after disorder it by Faction. I will therefore have an especial Eye to the Exercise, and either my self or the Proctors be usually there. Octob. 19. 1640. Chr. Potter, Vice-Chan.

Octob. 26. 1640. Chr. Potter. I Have already gather'd a pretty Purse of Mulcts from Taverns and such Places in my Night and Day Walks, and mean to continue the Course: Though I doubt not that some of our back Friends in Parliament will give us but little Thanks: Some there, perhaps many, rather desiring we should be guilty, that they might with more colour use us as they did the Monasteries. God preserve this miserable Na∣tion from Sacrilege and Atheism: To which I say Amen. I hang'd up last Week this fair and short Monition following at the Door of the Congregation; and it hath already brought in many Mi∣niver-Hoods, and will in short time prevail (I hope) with all, with∣out any word or murmur of Contradiction.

WIthin the Precincts of the University I cannot hear of any one A Search for Arms in Recu∣sants Houses. Convicted Recusant: Yet I am resolved to morrow to desire the Mayor to go along with me to view and search all Recusants Houses, what Munition or Arms they have. November 23. 1640. Ch. Potter. I Am very glad to hear from you, that you know of no Convicted Recusant in Oxford: Yet you shall do very well to make the Search
which you mention. It will be a very good Justification both of your self and the Place. November 27. 1640. W. Cant. IN our Visit (Mr. Mayor's and mine on Tuesday last) of our Recu∣sants Houses, we found nothing that was like to Arms, only in Mr. Napper's of Holy-Well, Furniture for one Light Horse, with which he is charged. In other Houses, (most of them poor, mean Persons, seven or eight in all) here a Pistol, and there a Sword rusty, and else∣where a Birding-Piece; so we are safe enough from them. God keep us from the Scots. In that View I found two Convicted: One here below East-Gate, a sorry labouring Mason. The other, one Mr. Hunt, by the Castle, a Stranger; staying here only a while in a House of his own, till he can find some Brewer to take it, being fit for that purpose, and standing void. November ult. 1640. Ch. Potter. I Thank you for your Pains in your Search for Arms among Recusants, and am glad you find all so safe, and them so unfurnish'd. As for Mr. Hunt, if he be a Stranger, the sooner the Town is rid of him, the better. For the Confirmation of your Endowments upon your Professors and Confirmation of the Lectu∣rers Endow∣ments by Par∣liament. Orators, you shall do well when the great Businesses are more over, (for till then it will not be intended) to move for Confirmation in Parliament. And in the mean time it may be very for you fit to pre∣pare a Bill by some good Council, which may contain them all in one, if it may be. It is true, you write that most Colleges have upon Christmas-day a Christmas-day's Morning Ser∣mon put to the Afternoon. Sermon and a Communion in their private Chapels, and by that means cannot come to the publick Sermon of the University at Christ-Church. And whereas you write farther, that some have wished, that in re∣gard of this the Morning Sermon for the University might be put off This was con∣cluded by a general con∣sent of the Heads, Decem. 7th. 1640. to the Afternoon (as it is upon Easter-day for the like occasion) I for my part think the motion very good, it being a day of Solemn Obser∣vation. Yet I would have it proposed to the Heads, and then that which you shall do by publick Consent shall very well satisfie me. Lambeth, Dec. 4. 1640. W. Cant.

The Vice-Chancellor, ac∣cording to the Command of the Committee for Religion in the House of Commons, sent up the Copy of Wilkinson's Sermon, and his Ex∣ceptions against it upon Tuesday December 8th, the time appointed for the Committee.

WHereas upon Enquiry made by Dr. Frewen, late Vice-Chancel∣lor No Universi∣ty-Man suspe∣cted of Pope∣ry. of Oxford, in two several Assemblies of the Heads of Hou∣ses there, none of them could inform him of any University-Man, whom he knew or probably suspected to be a Papist, or Popishly af∣fected: Notwithstanding which Care of the Governors, and clearness of the Vniversity, it could not be avoided but some Persons suggesti∣ons should be put up to the High Court of Parliament, as if Mass were ordinarily said in the University, and frequented by Vniversity-Men without any Controll of the Governors there. We therefore the present Vice-Chancellor and the Heads of Houses, for the better clearing of our University from such foul Imputations, have thought fit under our Hands to testifie, That we are so far from conniving at the Celebration of Mass here, or knowing of any such Matter, that we neither know, nor can probably suspect any Member of our University to be a Papist, or Popishly addicted.

MY Present Condition is not unknown to the whole World, yet by Resignation of the Chancel∣lorship, in a Letter to the University. few pitied or deplored; The righteous God best knows the Justice of my sufferings, on whom both in life and death I will ever depend: the last of which shall be unto me most welcome, in that my life is now burdensome unto me, my mind attended with variety of sad and grievous thoughts, my soul continually vexed with anxieties and troubles, groaning under the burden of a displeased Parliament, my name as∣persed and grosly abused by the multiplicity of Libellous Pamphlets, and my self debarred from wonted access to the best of Princes, and it is Vox Populi that I am Popishly affected. How earnest I have been in my Disputations, Exhortations, and otherwise to quench such sparks, lest they should become Coals, I hope after my death you will all acknowledge; yet in the midst of all my afflictions there is nothing more hath so nearly touched me as the remembrance of your free and joyful acceptance of me to be your Chancellor, and that I am now shut up from being able to doe you that Service which you might justly expect from me. When I first received this honour I intended to have carried it with me to my Grave; neither were my hopes any less, since the Parliament (called by his Majesties Royal Command) committed me to this Royal Prison. But sith (by reason of matters of greater con∣sequence yet in hand) the Parliament is pleased to procrastinate my Try∣al, I doe hereby as thankfully resign my Office of being Chancellor, as ever I received that Dignity, entreating you to Elect some Honourable Person, who upon all occasions may be ready to serve you; and I beseech God send you such an one as may do all things for his glory, and the furtherance of your most famous Vniversity. This is the continual Prayer of, Tower, June 28. 1641. Your dejected Friend and Chancellor, Being the last time I shall write so, W. Cant. FINIS.
AN ANSWER TO THE SPEECH OF The Right HONOURABLE WILLIAM Lord Viscount Say and Seal, &c. SPOKEN IN PARLIAMENT, Upon the BILL about BISHOPS POWER in CIVIL AFFAIRS, AND COURTS of JUDICATURE, Anno 1641. By the Most Reverend WILLIAM LAUD Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, Then Prisoner in the TOWER. Non apposui ultimam manum, W. CANT.
Arch-Bishop LAVD's ANSWER TO THE Lord SAY's SPEECH Against the BISHOPS. THIS Speech is said to have done the Bishops, their Calling, and their present Cause a great deal of harm, among the Gentry, and divers sober-minded Men: and therefore I did much wonder that so many learned Bishops, present in the House to hear it, should not, (some of them) being free and among their Books, so soon as it was printed, give it Answer, and stop the venom which it spits from poysoning, so many at least, as it's said to have done; especially that Bishop who stands named in the Margin, and against whom in particular the Speech was in part directed, should (as I conceive) to vindicate himself, as well as the Cause, have taken this task upon him. But since I see all Men si∣lent, and the Speech go away in triumph, as if it were unanswerable truth, though the Bill be now past, and the Bishops with their Votes cast out of the House, and from all Civil Employment, yet I thought it fit, if not necessary, to call this Speech to an account in every pas∣sage, and with all due respect approve what is just, and give the rest such an Answer as it deserves. And though you may think this An∣swer comes too late, as indeed it doth to remedy the present Evil, yet I have thought fit to go on with these my Endeavours, that if these miserable distracted times have an end (which I have no hope to live to see) the Errours of this Speech may appear, and the Bi∣shops perhaps recover their ancient Rights. If not (as I confess 'tis very hard in England) that yet the World may see how unjustly they suffer'd, and with what misguided Zeal this Lord hath fallen upon the Church, as indeed he hath done in all kinds. And I pray God something fall not therefore upon Him and His. The Speech then begins thus:
My Lords, I shall not need to begin as high as Adam in answer to what hath been drawn down from thence by a The Bishop of Lincoln. Bishop concerning this Question, for that which is pertinent to it, will only be what concerns Bishops, as they are Ministers of the Gospel: What was before, being of ano∣ther Nature, can give no Rule to this. Whether this Reverend Bishop, now Lord Arch-Bishop of York, did begin his Speech as high as Adam, I cannot tell, nor what proof he made after such beginning; for I was committed long before this Speech was made: but if he did bring it down from Adam, I think there may be good Reason for it. For it will appear, for the two thousand years before the Law, and for two thousand years more under the Law of Moses, that the Priests, especially the High and Chief Priests, did meddle in all the great Temporal Affairs, which fell out in their times. And first for the time before the Law, 'tis mani∣fest, and receiv'd by all Men, that the Sacerdotium  ante Legem, apud Colentes Deum, secundum hu∣manam determinationem, qui hanc dignitatem Primogenitis attribue∣bant. Tho. 1. 2. q. 103.  1. ad 3. Ante tempus veteris Legis non e∣rant determinati Ministri  cul∣tûs, sed dicitur, quod Primogeniti erant Sacerdotes, qui duplicem por∣tionem accipiebant. Tho. 2.2. q. 87. à 1. ad 3. And it is irresragably manifest by the Lord's Commands to Moses, that he should take the Levites instead of the First-born, Numb. 3. 45. Why in∣stead of the First-born, if the First-born did not perform the Publick Service of the Lord before that time? Primogeni∣tus, the First-born was Priest, and the First-born in the Prime and Leading Families, were as the Chief-Priests in their several Generations: and 'tis more than absurd to think that all these Prime Men in their several Families first, and Tribes after, being Priests, should be estranged from all their Civil and Temporal Affairs, and leave them in the hands of Younger and Weaker Men. And as be∣fore the Law there is no express Text for this their forbearance to help to manage Civil Affairs, so nei∣ther can there any sufficient Reason be given why they should abstain. Neither did they. For in∣stance, Abraham was a Priest, and a great one, for he was a Patriarch, Heb. 7. 4. And his Priesthood appears in that he was the first Minister of the Sacrament of Circumcision. Gen. 17. 23. and yet he managed his Family, and trained up his Servants in that which is most opposite to the Priestly Function, even for War. Nay took them, and went in Person against five Kings, and redeemed his Kinsman Lot by the Sword, Gen. 14. 14, 16. And Melchisedeck, who is expresly called the Priest of the high God, was King of Salem also: a Gen. 14. 18. Heb. 7. 1. King and a Priest too, so both capable by one Person. And as he received Tythes as a Priest, so no doubt can be made but he ordered and governed Civil Affairs as a King. Before these Noah was a Priest, and offered Sacrifice, Gen. 8. 20. and yet all the great care and trouble of building the Ark, and managing the preservation of the whole World, was committed to him by God himself, and under∣took by him, Gen. 6. Under the Law the Case comes under fuller and clearer Proof. And in the first entrance Moses himself was Saccrdos Sacerdotum, the Man that consecrated Aaron, Exod. 40. 13. and after reckon'd with  Levit. 8. 1. among the Priests of God, Psal. 99.6. and yet the whole Princely Jurisdiction resided in him all his days. But God commanded him
to settle the Priesthood upon Aaron, to teach the World that few Men's Abilities were fit for the Heighth of both those Places, since Moses himself was order'd to ordain Aaron, and divide the Burthen. After this division the High Priest did meddle in Civil Affairs, even the greatest, as well as Moses continued his Care of the Synagogue. In the numbering of the People for War, a thing of sole Imperial Cognisance, if any, Aaron was joined in Commission with Moses by God himself, to number them by their Armies; and they did it, Numb. 1. 3. 17. 44. In the ordering of the Standards and Ensigns of the Children of Israel in their removes from place to place, God's own Com∣mand came alike to Moses and Aaron, Numb. 2. 1, 2. the Silver Trumpets to call the Assemblies of the People together did belong to Moses, the People had nothing to do with them; nor might they tumultu∣ously assemble, but orderly, as the Sound of the Trumpets directed them; but the Priests, the Sons of Aaron were to sound them, Num. 10. 8, 9,11. And this Duty lay upon them as well when they went to War, as when they sacrificed. In the Survey of the Land of Promise Aaron was interessed as well as Moses: And this appears plainly, First, in that when the Spies (all save Joshua and Caleb) had brought up an evil Report upon the Land, the People fall into a Murmuring, and were as mad against Aaron as against Moses, Numb. 14. 2, 5. Secondly, because when the Land of Promise came to be divided among the Tribes, no Spiritual business was it, and yet in the Commission which Moses gave for the solemn Division of the Land, both to Reuben, Gad, and the half Tribe of Manasses on the one side of Jordan, and on the other side to the other Tribes, and to all the Princes of the several Tribes of Israel, Eleazar the Priest was first and principal, Numb. 32. 2, 28. & 34.17. even before Joshua himself: and that not only here during Moses his life, but even after, at the actual Division of the Land to every Tribe, though Joshua was then the Leader of the Peo∣ple, Josh. 19. 51. In the great Murmuring of the People at Kadesh, for want of Water, which was like enough to break out into an Insur∣rection, the Commission which God himself gave out to gather the Assembly together, and to satisfie the People with Water out of the Rock (a harder thing for Moses to do when he looks upon the Peo∣ple, than for God when he looks upon the Rock) went jointly to Moses and Aaron, Numb. 20. and they performed it accordingly. Thus far it went, and in all these great Particulars in Aaron's Life time; as if God would give a pattern in the first High Priest under the Law, what his Successours in some Cases might, and in some must do in great and Civil Affairs. And not so only, but to instruct the Successours of Moses also what value they should put upon Aaron and his Successours, if they will follow the way which God himself prescribed, and which hath been taken up and followed in all well govern'd Kingdoms, as well Christian as Heathen, till this very time that this ignorant boisterous Faction hath laboured to bear sway, as a They would have Clergy-Men not admitted, or very sparingly to Matters of State, contrary to the practice of all well govern'd Common-wealths and of our own till these late Years. Geo. Cranmer, Epist. to Mr. Hooker. p. 13. learned Country-Man of ours hath observed. And therefore though God set the pattern in Aaron, yet he continued it farther, to shew (as I conceive) that his Will was it should continue. For no sooner was Aaron dead, but his
Son Eleazar succeeded in all those great Civil employments, as well as in the Priesthood. For when the People of Israel were come into the plain of Moab near Jerico, and were ready to enter into the Land of Promise, God himself joyned Eleazar with Moses for the numbring of all the People that were found fit for War, which they were to expect at their entrance into Canaan, Numb. 26. 1, 3. In the difficult point of Inheritance for the Daughters of Zelophehad, when they came and demanded right of Moses, their demand was made to him and Eleazar, and the Princes of the Congregation, Numb. 27. 2. which they would not have done had not Eleazar had a Vote in that Judicature with Moses and the Princes. And no less than God himself commanded Moses to declare Joshua to be his Successour in the presence of the Congregation, Josh. 17. 4. And orders farther that Joshua shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, and that Eleazar shall ask Counsel for him after the Judgment of Vrim before the Lord. Numb. 27. 18, 19, 23. Now I would fain know of this Lord, whether Eleazar might give Joshua the Counsel which he asked of God for him. If he might not, why did God appoint him to ask it for Joshua? If he might, then he might give Counsel in Temporal Affairs, for so runs the Text about the War to be had with the Canaanites. At Eleazar's word they should go out, and at his word they should come in, both Joshua and all the Children of Israel. Phineas the Son of Eleazar, but Priest too, though not High Priest till after his Father's Death, was employed by Moses in the War against the Midianites, Numb. 31. 6. and the Trumpets put into his Hands. After the Victory over them, the Captains and the Spoil were brought to Moses, Eleazar, and the chief Fathers of the Con∣gregation to divide them, v. 12, 26. and an express Law ordained, that if there be a matter too hard for them in Judgment, (I pray mark it, 'tis between blood and blood, between plea and plea, between stroke and stroke; these are no Ecclesiastical Matters, I trow,) that they should go unto the Priests, the Levites, and to the Judges that shall be in those days, Deut. 17. 8, 9. and he that will not hearken unto the Priest and Judge shall die, v. 12. Was the Priest here excluded from all Tem∣poral affairs? Nay, was he excluded from any, when his Judgment was required between Blood and Blood? Nay, the Geneva Note adds here, Annot. in Deut. 17. 9. that the Judge was to give Sentence as the Priests counsel him by the Law of God; which gives the Priest a greater power than the Judge, since he was to follow the Priest's Direction, and Confer. with Hart, c. 6. Di∣vis. 2. p. 203. Dr. Ray∣nolds tells us very learnedly, that this Law was made to establish the highest Court of Judgment among that People, in which all harder Causes both Ecclesiastical and Civil should be determined without far∣ther Appeal. When the People made War and came nigh unto the Battle, the Priest was to approach and speak unto them; and when he had done, the Officers were to speak to them likewise; which must needs imply that the Priests which were present were not strangers to some at least of the Counsels of the War, Deut. 20. 2, 5. and the whole Law, the Judicial as well as the rest, was delivered by Moses, after he had written it, unto the Priests the Sons of Levi, and unto all the Elders of Israel, Deut. 31. 9. so was the Priest trusted with the Custody and in the discussing of the Law, and (as is before
mentioned.) Eleazar had his Hand in distributing the Land of Canaan to the several Tribes, as well as Joshua, and the other Elders of Israel, Josh. 14. 1. Nay though this were not ordinary and usual; yet Eli was so far trusted with and employed in Temporal Affairs, as that being High Priest, he was also Judge over Israel fourty Years, 1 Sam. 4. 18. and after him Samuel a Levite Judged Israel, and no Man better. Yea, and after the Captivity of Babylon also, for well near five Hundred Years, the Priesthood had the greatest Stroke in the Government; as under the Maccabees, and they did all that belonged unto them very worthily, and it pleased God to make that Family very victori∣ous. After Samuel, when that People had Kings to Govern them, in that great and most unnatural Conspiracy of Absalom against his Father David, in that great distress, Hushai was ordered by David to return and mix himself with the Counsels of Absalom, and to impart all things to Zadoc and Abiathar the Priests, that by them and their Sons, David might come to know what was useful or necessary for him to do, 1 Sam. 15. 27. 32. 35. and Hushai's making no scruple nor reply to this, makes it clear that Zadoc and Abiathar were formerly trusted with David's Counsels, and that Hushai had observ'd them to be prudent and secret. And when David was old, he called a kind of Parliament for the settling his Son Solomon in the Kingdom. To that great Assembly he gathered together all the Princes of Israel, with the Priests and the Levites, 1 Chron. 23. 1, 2. so far was he from turning their Votes out of the House of that great Consultation, that Six Thousand of them were by the Wisdom of that Senate made Offi∣cers and Judges throughout the Kingdom, v. 4. and this was done on both sides of Jordan in all businesses of the Lord, and in the Service of the King, 1 Chron. 26. 30, 32. In the beginning of Solomon's Reign, Abiathar the High Priest was in all the great Counsels of that State, but falling into the Treason of Adonijah, he was deprived by Solomon, and Zadock made High Priest in his Room, 1 King. 2. 27, 35. And when Jehosaphat repaired the decays of that State, he set the Priests and the Levites in their right places again, according to that Law in Deut. 17. 8, 9. and restored to them that Power in Judicature which was by God's appointment settled in them, 2 Chron. 19. 8. And that he had relation to that Law is manifest, because he pitches almost upon the same words, v. 10. as Conf. with Hart, c. 6. Di∣vis. 2. p. 203. Dr. Raynolds hath observed before me. And Jehoiada the High Priest was the preserver of Joash, the right Heir of the Crown, against the Usurpations of Athaliah; and when he had settled him in his Kingdom, though not without Force of Arms, and they also ordered by Jehoiada, 2 Chron. 23. 8. he was inward in his Counsels, and was ruled by him in his Mar∣riage, 2 Chron. 24. 2. and he died with this Testimony, that this young King did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, all the days wherein Jehoiada instructed him, 2 King. 12. But after his Death you may read what befel Joash, 2 Chron. 24. In all the Conduct of this People out of Egypt, in which many Temporal Businesses did occur, Aaron was joyned with Moses in and through all. Thou leadest thy People like sheep (saith the Prophet, Psal. 77.) by or in the Hand of Moses and Aaron. The Prophet David was a great Shepherd himself,
and knew very well what belonged to leading the People; and you see he is so far from separating Aaron from Moses in the great work of leading the People, that though they be two Persons, and have two distinct Powers, yet in regard the one is subordinate and sub∣servient to the other, they are reputed to have but one Hand in this great Work. And therefore in the Original, and in all the Transla∣tions which render it, 'tis said in Manu, not in Manibus, in the Hand, not in the Hands, of Moses and Aaron. So necessary did God in his Wisdom think it, that Aaron should be near about Moses in the Government of his People. And as the Priests and Levites were great Men in the great Sanhedrim at Jerusalem, so were two of them ever in all the lesser Sanhedrims in the several Cities of every Tribe, for so Oppidatim praesint septem viri probatae virtutis & justitiae cultores:  Magistratibus attribuantur duo Ministri de Tribu Levitica. Jo∣seph. l. 4. Antiq. c. 8. Josephus witnesses expresly, that two of them were ever allotted to each Magi∣stracy. Jeroboam's Sin it was, and a great one, to make the lowest of the People Priests, 1 King. 12. 13. and I pray God it be not the Sin of this Age to make the Priests the lowest of the People. So by this I think it appears, that nothing of like Antiquity can well be more clear, than that four thousand years before and under the Law, the Priests, especially the chief Priests did meddle in, and help manage the greatest Temporal Affairs. And this, as this Ho∣nourable Person cannot but know, so I presume he was willing warily to avoid. For he tells you he shall not need to begin so high. Not need? And why so? Why, it is because (saith he) the Question is only what concerns Bishops as they are Ministers of the Gospel, and that which was before being of another Nature can give no Rule to this. No Man doubts but this Question in Par∣liament belongs only to Bishops as they are Ministers of the Gospel, nay more particularly than so, as they are Ministers of the Gospel in the Church of England only. For either this must be said, or else granted it must be by this Honourable Lord, that the Parliament of England takes upon them to limit Episcopacy through all the Christian World, and to teach all States therein, what they are to do with their Bishops. And this were as bold a part for the English Parliament to do, as it is for a private English-man to censure the Parliament. And truly, for my own part, I cannot tell how to excuse the Parliament in this. For though in the Act Feb. 15. 1641/2. now past there be nothing enacted but that which concerns Bishops, and such as are in Holy Orders here, because their Power stretches no farther than this Kingdom, yet their Aim and their Judgment is general. And this appears by the Preface of that Act, which runs thus. Whereas Bishops, and other Persons in Holy Orders, ought not to be intangled with Secular Jurisdiction, &c. Ought not: Therefore in their Judgment 'tis Malum per se, a thing in it felf unlawful for any Man in Holy Orders to meddle in, or help manage Temporal Affairs. For though their words be, Ought not to be intangled (which as that word in∣tangled bears sense in English, and stands for an absolute hindring of them from the works of their own Calling, I grant as well as they) yet the Act proceeds generally to divest them of all Power and Jurisdiction in Civil Affairs, whether they be intangled with them or not.
But be it so, that this Question belongs to Bishops only as they are Ministers of the Gospel, yet why may not the Ancient Usage before the Law, and the Law of God Himself give a Rule to this? For sure, if they can give no Rule in this, then can they give no Rule to any thing else under the Gospel, that is not simply Moral in it self, as well as none to Prelates, and their assisting in Temporal Affairs. Which Opinion how many things it will disjoynt both in Church and State is not hard to see. First then, I shall endeavour to make it appear, that the practice of pious Men before the Law, and the Pre∣cept of the Law, can give a Rule to many things under the Gospel; and then I will examine how, and how far those things may be said to be of another Nature, which is the Reason given why they can give no Rule in this. For the First, that they can give a Rule, I hope it will appear very plainly. For in things that are Typical, the Type must praefigure the Antitype, and give a kind of Rule to make the Antitype known: Therefore in Typical things no Question is or can be made, but that the things which were under the Law can give a Rule to us Christi∣ans. Though this bold Proposition runs universally, without except∣ing things Typical or any other. Besides, the Priests had a hand in all Temporal Affairs, and in matters which were no way Typical, but meerly belonging to Order and Government, as appears by the Proofs before made. And therefore the Jews may be Precedents for Christians, which could not possibly be if they could give us no Rule. Nor is this any new Doctrine. For that ancient Commentary under the Name of St S. Ambros. in 1 Cor. 14.30. Traditio Syna∣gogae est quam nos vult secta∣ri. Ambrose tells us expresly, that that which is mentioned by St. Paul, 1 Cor. 14. 30. is a Custom of the Synagogue which he would have us to follow. And as this Doctrine is not new, so neither is it refused by later Writers, and some of them as Learned almost as this Lord. For that which was ordered, 1 Chron. 23. 30. that they should stand every Morning and Evening to thank and praise the Lord, is precedent enough to presume that the like is not against the Law of God. And Calv. in Act. 3. 1. Calvin speaks it out expresly. In regard (saith he) that God himself instituted that they should offer Sacrifice Morning and Evening, inde colligitur, it is thence collected plainly, that the Church cannot want a certain Discipline. So here the Jews Discipline gives an express Rule to us. And it is very learnedly and truly observed by a late Writer Her. Thorn. dike, Epistle to the Reader be∣fore his Tract of Religious Assemblies. of Ours. That there is no such Light to the true meaning of Scripture, as the Practice of matters contained in it under the Synagogue, and in the Church afterwards. Now what Light can we possibly receive from the Synagogue, if those things which were before can give no Rule to us? Besides, for ought I know of this Lord's Religion, he may brand all the Old Testament as deeply as the Manichees did of old, or go very near it, if it can give no Rule, and so be of no use to Christians. S. Aug. contra Faustum. St. Augustine was of another Mind through all his Books against Faustus the Manichee. And S. Aug. lib. 6. Confess. c. 4. Vete∣ra Scripta Legis & Prophetarum, tanquam Regulam dillgentissime com∣mendavit Ambrosius in popularibus Sermonibus. St. Ambrose most expresly, and very frequent∣ly recommended this, tanquam Regulam, as a Rule to the People. And in this very Case of Episco∣pacy, Clem. Ep. ad Corinth. p. 52, 53. Clemens Romanus tells us, There is a kind
of Parallel between Bishops, Presbyters and Dea∣cons, in the one, and High Priests, Priests and Le∣vites in the other Church. And Quod Aaron & filii , atque  in Templo fuerunt, hoc sibi Episcopi, Presbyteri atque Diaconi vendicant in Ecclesia. S. Hier. Ep. ad Evagr. St. Jerom speaks it out, that such as Aaron and his Sons, and the Tribe of Levi were in the Temple, the same are Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons in the Church of Christ. And this they might justly challenge to themselves, and make it a Rule. But 'tis time to proceed to other Particulars. In the Case of Tythes we find that they were due Jure Divino, by Divine Right, to the Priests under the Law, and some were paid before the Law, no Man doubts; but many will not grant that there is any Divine Right, commanding or ordering them to be paid to the Priests under the Gospel. Yet this is undeniable that Tythes have been paid to the Ministers under the Gospel, in all or most parts of Christendom, for many Hundreds of Years together; and God be thanked the Payment continues yet in some Places. What was it then, if not Divine Right, that gave the Rule to Christians for this kind of Pay∣ment, but the Practice before the Law and the Precept under it? Shall we say here, as this Lord doth, That what was before can give no Rule to this. Now God forbid. The whole Christian World thought otherwise. And whatsoever becomes of the Controversie about Tythes, yet this is certain, that the Ministers of the Gospel ought to have a liberal and free Maintenance. Men, whom they serve in and for Christ, must not open their Mouths too often to preach, and muzzle them whom they should feed. And the Rule for this is given by the Law, for it is written in the Law of Moses. Thou shall not muzzle the Mouth of the Ox that treads out the Corn. Doth God take care for Oxen, or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt this is written, 1 Cor. 9. 9. And yet how many of these Oxen are poorly shuted, and in a manner muzzel'd, is evident enough. How comes this to pass? How? Why surely, the Apostle St. Paul was utterly deceived here, ask my Lord else; for he proves this point of their Maintenance, because 'tis so written in the Law of Moses, whereas that Law which was before can give no Rule to this. Again, The Lord himself hath ordained (so saith St. Paul, v. 14.) that they which preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel. Not starve by the Gospel, but live upon it; live plentifully and decently. But by what Rule did the Lord himself proceed in this? If his Will had been his Rule, no Rule so strait, it could not but have been just. But St. Paul tells us there, v. 13. that God himself proceeded by another Rule, Do ye not know (saith he) that they which minister about Holy things, live of the things of the Temple, and they which wait on the Altar are partakers with the Altar? , — even so hath the Lord ordained. Just so: That as the Priests and Levites under the Law, did wait on the Altar and live by it, so must they who preach the Gospel, by the Gospel. Just so: Why then, how did the Priest under the Law live? 'Tis set down at large, Deut. 18. 1. Numb. 10. 9. and a very full Portion they had, so full as that they might have no Inheritance amongst their Brethren, the Lord's Portion which
was made theirs was so great, yet , so the Lord ordained for the Ministers of the Gospel. Press this a little farther and 'twill come to the quick. The Priests and Levites under the Law, besides their partaking with the Altar, had the Tythes of all duly paid them. Will not  reach to this too? If so, then 'tis clear in the Text, that the Lord himself ordained payment of Tythes to the Ministers of the Gospel. For the ordained that the Ministers of the Gospel, should live of the Gospel, , just as the Priests under the Law did of the Altar. I will not be peremtory in this sense of the Text, yet I would have it well considered. And howsoever, that a free and plentiful Certain Maintenance is the Ordinance of the Lord himself, is by this Text as clear as the Sun. Now this Lord should do well to tell St. Paul, that either he mistook the Lord's Ordinance, or if he did not, that then the Lord himself was mistaken in so ordaining for the Ministers of the Gospel, because what was before can give no Rule to this. Farther yet, you may see the Vanity, the Nothing of this bold As∣sertion in other particulars beside the Case of Tything. For if nei∣ther the State of Man before the Law, nor the Law it self can give any Rule in things of this kind, to us that live under the Gospel, then there is nothing in God's Law that can give a Rule to us, but that a Man may remove his Neighbour's Land-mark, he may lead the Blind out of the way, he may smite his Neighbour so it be secretly, he may marry in many Degrees of Consanguinity, and what may he not? For all these and many things more are prohibited only in the Law, Deut. 27. Levit. 18. But that going before can give no Rule to these. Now the Apostle tells us, 1 Cor. 10. 6, 11. That those things were our Examples, and written for our admonition. And he speaks of things before and under the Law. And more generally, Rom. 15. 4. Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning. Now, learn well and certainly we cannot, but by Rule; and therefore most manifest it is, that those things which were before, can give us Rules, whatsoever is here said to the con∣trary. Two things there are which work much with me, why this Lord should say that the things which were before and under the Law can give no Rule in this: And if not in this, then not in things like to this. The one is the Power which Kings have in their several Dominions over the external Government and Polity of the Church. The Apostle's Rule goes in the general only, Let every Soul be subject. Rom. 13. 1. But the Rule drawn down to particulars is from the the commended Practice of the Kings of Juda under the Law. Now if these can give us no Rule, then we have none at all brought down to particulars, wherein that Power consists. And here this Lord being a known Separatist from the Church of England (as appears most manifestly by another Speech of his Lordship's in Parliament, and printed with this) separates, I doubt, from her Do∣ctrine too, and will not, (could he speak out with safety) allow Kings any Power at all in Church Affairs, more than to be the Executioners to see the Orders of their Assemblyes executed, in such things as they need the Civil Sword. And therefore he doth
wisely in his generation, to say, That the things which were before can give no Rule in this. The other is, that there is of late a Name of Scorn fastned upon the Brethren of the Separation, and they are commonly called Round∣heads, from their Fashion of cutting close and rounding of their Hair: A Fashion used in It is  the Graecians did wear long Hair, and therefore Homer calls them , Ca∣pite  Achivos, L. 2. Iliad. And Eustathius,  upon that place, saith, they wear it long at other times, but cut it in the time of Sorrow. And Achil∣les and his Company. cut off their Hair, and cast it upon the dead Body of Patroclus to cover it. Homer. l. 23. Il. And at the Funerals of Achilles, the Graecians are said to shed warm Tears  — and to have cut their Hair. Homer. l. 24. Od. That the Romans wore their Hair long, is evident by Varro, who saith that Barbers were not known in Italy before the year 454, post U. C. About that time Tici∣nius Menas brought them in. Varro, L. 2. de Re Rust. c. ult. And that they did cut their Hair at Funerals, is plain in Andreas Tiraquel. — Romani in aliis luctibus quam funerum Capillum Barbantque promittebant. Annot. in Alex. ab Alex. l. 3. c. 7. But then they cut them. And when this rounding went , indeed it came some∣what near Baldness; which the Jews were likewise for∣bidden to make upon themselves for the Dead, Deut. 14. 1. & Jerem. 16. 6. And as this Rounding of the Head was sometimes a sign of superstitious sorrowing, so was it (with some difference) used as an esseminate and luxurious Fashion. And there∣fore Ganimedes were said , circumtondere. Dio. Chrysoft. Orat. 2. de Regno. And Harlots. After which manner they say Harlots were cut, . And that it was a kind of rounding the Head,  in Lexico, verbo . Which kind of rounding the Hair Tertullian mentions L. de Cultu Foeminatum, c. 8. and L. de Pallio, c. 4. he objects the use of it to his Carthaginians. And in some places, this rounding of the Head was a mark of Servitude and Vassallage, as among the ancient French, where the King only and the Heir apparent had Jus Capilitii, in token of his , and the rest were Circumtonsi. Selden, Praefat. to his Titles of Honour, Ex Cedreno. But whether our Round-heads do it for Superstition, or for Luxury, or out of any Base and Servile Condition, I cannot tell; though I think there need be little Question, but that many of them are guilty of all three, their  being not a Robe large enough to hide all of them; and some of their Conventicles have of late . Paganism in the times of their Mournings, and sad oc∣currences, as these seem to do, put∣ing on in outward shew at least a sowr Look and a more severe Carriage than other Men. This Fashion of Round∣ing the Head, God himself forbids his People to practise, the more to with∣draw from the Superstitions of the Gentiles. Ye shall not round the Corn∣ers of your Heads, Lev. 19. 27. This express Text of Scripture troubled the Brownists and the rest extreamly; and therefore this Lord being a great fa∣vourer of theirs, if not one himself, hath thought upon this way to ease their minds, and his own. For 'tis no matter for this Text, nor for their resembling Heathen Idolaters; they may round their Heads safely, since those things which were before can give no Rule in this. And I do not doubt but that if this World go on, the dear Sisters of these Rattle-heads will no longer keep silence in their Churches, or Conventicles, since the A∣postle surely is deceived, where he saith that Women are not permitted to speak in the Churches, because they are to be under Obedience, as also saith the Law, 1 Cor. 14. For the Law and those things which were before can give no Rule in this; and therefore they shall not need to go as high as Adam to answer this. They shall not need in this, nor we in that of Episcopacy, go so high as Adam. But yet we may if we will, for so high the Apostle goes in this place. And I thank this Lord for that Liberty (if he means so well) that though we need not go so high, yet we may if we list. And this is most certain, that any State Christian may receive all or as much of the Judicial Law of Moses as they please, and find fit for them; and as much of the Ceremonial as detracts not from Christ come in the Flesh. And since all Law is a Rule, this could not be done if those Laws being before could be no Rule to us. This is proof enough (as I conceive) that these things which were before, can give a Rule to us now under the Gospel. My Lord thinks not so, for this Reason, Because they are of another Nature.
Secondly, therefore the Reason comes to be examined. Wherein I shall weigh two things. First, Whether the Law of Moses and the Gospel of Christ are things of another Nature, and how far? And Secondly, Whether this be universally true, that among things of another Nature one cannot give a Rule to another. 1. For the first, I shall easily acknowledge a great deal of diffe∣rence between the Law and the Gospel. They differ in the Strictness of the Covenant made under either: They differ in the Sacraments and Sacramentals used in either: They differ in the Ex∣tent and Continuance of either: They differ in the Way and Power of justifying a Sinner; and perhaps in more things than these. And in these things in which they thus differ, and qua, as they so differ, the Law can give no Rule to Christians; but whether these diffe∣rences do make the Law and the Gospel things of quite another Na∣ture, (which are the words here used) I cannot but doubt a little. First, because more or less strictness doth not vary the Covenant in Nature though it doth in Grace; And so Arist. persues it. Impe∣rare & parere, non differunt secun∣dum Magis & Minus, quia differunt specie. Arist. L. 2. Polit. c. 8. for Magis & Minus non variant speciem, More or Less in any thing does not make a specifical Difference, and therefore not in Nature. And use of different Sacra∣ments do not make things to be of another Nature, where Res Sacra∣menti, the Substance of the Sacrament is one and the same. And so 'tis here. For one and the same Christ is the Substance of Circumcision and the Pascal Lamb, as well as of Baptism and the Eucharist. For our Fathers under the Law, did all cat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink of the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: And that Rock was Christ, 1 Cor. 10. 3, 4. And much less, can Extent or Continuance vary Nature: Not Extent; for Fire contained in a Chimny and spread miserably over a City, is one and the same in Nature. Not Continuance; for then a Father and his Son should not be of the same Nature, if the one live longer than the other. And as for the way and Power of Justifica∣tion, they difference the Law and the Gospel, not so much in their Nature as in their Relation to Christ, who alone is our Justification, 1 Cor. 1. 30. and was theirs also who lived under the Law, for both they and we, were and are justified by the same Faith in the same Christ. And this seems to me very plain in Scripture. For to this day (saith the Apostle) the Vail remains upon the Jews in the reading of the Old Testament, which Vail is done away in Christ, but we all with open Face behold as in a glass the Glory of the Lord, 2 Cor. 3. 14, 18. So one and the same Christ is in the Old Testament as well as in the New. Not so plainly; but there, though under a Vail. Now a Vail on and a Vail off, a dimmer and a clearer sight in and by the one than by the other, do in no case make the things of another Nature. Again; We find it expresly written Gal. 3. 24. That the Law was our School-master to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by Faith. Our School-master; therefore it must needs be able to give Rules unto us, or else it can never teach us. And the Rules it gives, are very good too, or else they can never bring us unto Christ, that we may be justified by Faith; which to do, St. Paul here tells us is the End
of the Law's Instruction. And this Instruction it could not so fully give, if this School-master were so of another Nature as that it could not give us a Rule in this. Besides, the Type and the Antitype, the Shadow and the Substance, howsoever they may be of another Nature if you look upon their Entity, yet in their Relative Nature, as Type and Antitype, Shadow and Substance, they are of the same Nature, and have mutual de∣pendence either upon other, and give Rules mutually either to other, and a Proof one of another. For a Man may take the measure of the Body by the Shadow, and of the Shadow by the Body. And so it is between the Law and the Gospel; the Sacrifices in the One, and Christ in the other. For the Law had but the Shadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things themselves, and therefore with those Sacrifices could make nothing perfect, Heb. 10. 1. But Christ is the Body it self, Col. 2. 17. And when he came into the World, he saith, Sacrifice and burnt Offering thou wouldest not have, but a Body hast thou given me, Heb. 10. 4. How shall this appear? How? Why, by the very Rules given in the Law. For so the Prophet tells us in the Person of Christ. In the volume of the Book it is written of me, Psal. 40. 7. Nay, so says Christ himself, St. Joh. 5. 46. Had ye believed Moses ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me. And to bring all home close to the present business; Christ, as God, of another Nature quite from Melchisedek, yet in Relation to the Priesthood, as Type and Antitype, not so; for Christ was Man also, and the one gave a kind of Rule to the other. For Christ was made a Priest after the order of Milchisedek, : Or as Mont. reads in the Margin Secundum Morem, according to the Form, Manner or Rule of Melchisedek's Priesthood. And as Melchisedek and Christ are Type and Antitype in their Priesthood, For those Priests served but to the Example, and to the Shadow, &c. But how hath he obtained a more excellent Ministery. Heb. 8. 5, 6. so the Priest∣hood of Aaron under the Law, was but a shadow of the Priesthood of Christ under the Gospel. And therefore the Priestood which is now, ought in all Privileges to exceed that under the Law, in as much as the Anti∣type and the Body is of more worth than the Type and the Shadow. I say, in all Privileges which are not appropiated by God himself to the Priesthood of the Law. 2. Secondly, It may be considered too, whether this be universally true; that among things which are of another Nature, one cannot give a Rule to another. For my own part, I doubt there is not Truth in the Rule, but instead of Truth a great deal of danger. And surely, if this be generally true, that that which was before (being of ano∣ther Nature) can give no Rule to this; that is, if that which was both before and under the Law concerning Priesthood can give no Rule, none at all, to the Ministery under the Gospel, then can it give no Rule in any thing else: Because the Law is as much of another Nature, in regard of other things, as of this. Nay, this very thing, the Priesthood, makes the Law to be of another Nature more than any thing else. And so the Apostle plainly, Heb. 7. 12. For the Priesthood being changed, made of Necessity a change also of the Law. But be this change, this other Nature what it will, if the Law can give no Rule at all in this (which again is directly con∣trary
to the Apostle 1. Cor. 9. 9, 13.) then can it no give Rule in any thing else pertaining to the Gospel. For the Reason if it be good, holds alike, 'tis of another Nature. Nay, yet farther, if this Reason be true, universally true, (as 'tis here given) then it reaches to, and thorough the whole Law. No part of it can give any Rule to Men, or things under the Gopsel. For if no Rule to things, then none to Men, who must do or leave undone; and if so, then the Moral Law can give no Rule to Men under the Gospel, more than the Ceremonial or the Judicial Law. For the whole Law was before the Gospel, and here said, without any distinction, to be of another Nature, and so unable to give a Rule. And for ought I know this zealous Lord may be of this Opinion. For this lewd Doctrine hath been somewhat common of late among his Favourites, that Moral Honesty is an Enemy to the Grace of Christ; that Harlots and debauched Persons are nearer to the Kingdom of God, than they which labor to shew themselves Moral Men, and the like. As if they went to teach the People to live lewdly, and to do evil that good may come thereof, whose Damnation the Apostle tells us is just, Rom. 3. 8. Whereas Christ came not to take away the Law, but to fulfill it for us, Mat. 5. 17. and in some measure to enable us to keep it also. And in the Gospel, when the Scribe told our Saviour, that to love God with all the Heart, and his Neighbour as himself, (up∣on which Commandments hang the whole Law, S. Mat. 22. 40.) was more than all burnt Sacrifices, our Saviour did not tell him that Harlots were nearer the Kingdom of God than he, or that this Law being of another Nature, could give him no Rule for his Life. But quite con∣trary, he told him for his Comfort, and the Comfort of Obedience, that he was not far from the Kingdom of God, S. Mar. 12. 34. And though this be bad enough, and will prove a fruitful Mother of all Libertinism and Prophaness, yet there is a greater danger behind. For if the Grace of Christ under the Gospel, be a discharge of the Moral Law, and disenable it to give a Rule, as being of another Nature, what shall become of God the Law-giver himself in all kinds? For he is quite of another Nature, eminently and infinitely exceed∣ing us, and whatsoever is, or can be naturally in us; yea or super∣naturally either. And what now? Shall not God himself being of another Nature give us any Rule in this or any thing else. I know this Lord will say, this is not his meaning. No truly, I hope it is not. But then this Lord if he will needs be writing and printing, should so express himself, as that he may not expose his words to such unsavory Consequences as (for ought I know) may justly be gathered from them. And let me tell him in the mean time, 'tis a dangerous thing to be so busie with the Law of God; and so without distinction, as he is, lest he intrench upon the Law-giver before he be aware. Howsoever, in this Proposition of his, that that which is before being of another Nature, can give no Rule to this, leaves him at a loss which way soever to turn himself. For since 'tis manifest by the Apostle in the places 1 Cor. 9. 9. 13, 14. Rom. 15.4. 1 Cor. 10.  11. before cited, that the Law of Moses which was before, doth give a Rule to divers things under the Gospel; this Lord of the Separation is at a loss every way. For if the Law and
that which was before be not of another Nature from this, then his Reason is false, which says it can give no Rule because 'tis of ano∣ther Nature, and so he is at a loss in that. And if it be of another Nature, yet it appears by the Apostle's practice, that for all that it can give a Rule in this. For that which can give the Apostle a Rule, can give a Rule to us: And so he is at a loss in the whole Proposi∣tion. For whether that which was before, be or be not of another Nature, yet it can give a Rule. I have been long upon this Passage, because I conceive the main Controversie hangs and turns upon this hinge. And if any Reader think it long or tedious, or be of this Lord's Mind, that he need not go so high for Proof, yet let him pardon me, who in this am quite of another Judgment. And for the pardon, I shall gratifie him, by being as brief as possibly I can in all that follows. Thus then this Lord proceeds: The Question which will lye before your Honours in passing this Bill, is not, Whether Episcopacy (I mean this Hierarchical Episco∣pacy which the World now holds forth to us) shall be taken away Root and Branch; but, Whether those exuberant and superfluous Branches, which draw away the Sapp from the Tree, and divert it from the right and proper use, whereby it becomes unfruitful, shall be cut off, as they use to pluck up Suckers from the Root. After this Lord had told us we need not go so high for the business, he comes now to state the present Question. Where he tells us what himself means by Episcopacy. Namely, Hierarchical Episcopacy, such as is properly and now commonly so called in the World. And this his Lordship adds because of that distinction made by Beza in his Tract de Triplici Episcopatu, Divino scilicet, Humano & Satanico. In which, what part Beza plays I will forbear to speak, but leave him and his Gall of bitterness to the Censure of the Learned. Sir Edw. Deering in his printed Speeches tells us, that others in milder . 16. p. 122. Language keep the same sense, and say there is Episcopus, Pastor, Praeses and Princeps. So in his account Episcopus, Princeps & Satani∣cus, is all one in milder terms. But the Truth is, that in the most learned and flourishing Ages of the Church, the Bishops were, and were called Principes, Chief and Prime, and Prince, if you will, in Church Affairs. For so Apices & Principes omnium. Optat. L. adv. Parm. Princeps Ecclesiae. S. Hilar. L. 8. de Trin. Prin. Greg. Nazianz. ascribit , Principatum, ad Re∣gimen Animarum Episcopo. Orat. 17. & 20. Quid aliud est Episcopus quam is qui omni Princi∣patu & Potestate superior est? in materia & gradu Re∣ligionis. Ignat. Ep. ad Trall. Principes Ecclesiae fiunt, &c. Opus imperf. in S. Matth. . 35. Principes futuros Ecclesiae Episcopos nominavit. S. Hier. in Esai. 6. 60. Optatus calls them the Chief, and Princes. And so likewise did divers others of the Fa∣thers, even the best learned and most devout. And this Title is given to Diocesan or Hierarchical Bishops, which doubtless these Fathers would neither have given nor taken, had Episcopus, Princeps and Satanicus been all one. Nor would Qued autem singulae Provinciae unum habebant in∣ter  Archiepiscopum, quod item in Nicena Synodo constituti sunt Patriarchae, qui essent Ordine. & Dignitate Archiepiscopis Superiores, id ad Discipli∣nae conservationem pertinebat. Calv. 4 Inst. E. 4.4. Calvin have taught us, that the Primitive Church had in eve∣ry Province among their Bishops one Arch-Bishop, and that in the Council of
Nice Patriarchs were appointed which should be in order and digni∣ty above Bishops, had he thought either such Bishops or Arch-Bishops to have been Satanical: And had Beza lived in those times, he would have been taught another Lesson. And the Truth is, Beza, when he wrote that Tract, had in that Argument either little Learning or no Honesty. But for this Lord, whether he means by Hierarchical Episcopacy, the same which Beza, I will not determine. He uses a Proper word and a Civil, and I will not purpose to force him into a worse meaning than he hath, or make him a worse Enemy to the Church (if worse he may be) than he is already. Though I cannot but doubt he is bathed in the same Tub. Having told us what he means by Episcopacy, he states the business thus: That the Question is not whether this Hierarchical Episcopacy shall be taken away Root and Branch. So then I hope this Lord will leave a Hierarchy (such as it shall be) in the Church. We shall not have it all laid level. We shall not have that Curse of Root and Branch (Job. 18, 16. for less it is not) laid upon us: Or at least not yet. But what shall follow in time, when this Bill hath us'd its edge, I know not. Well, if not Root and Branch taken away, what then? What? why, 'tis but whether those exuberant and superfluous Branches, which draw away the Sapp from the Tree, and divert it from the right and proper use, whereby it becomes unfruitful, shall be cut off, as they use to pluck up Suckers from the Root. This Lord seems to be a good Husbandman, but what he will prove in the Orchard or Garden of the Lord, I know not: For most true it is, that Suckers are to be plucked from the Root; and as true, that in the prime and great Vine, there are some Branches which bear no fruit, and our Saviour himself tells us, that they which are such, are to be taken a∣way, St. Joh. 15. 2. And therefore I can easily believe it that in Episcopacy, which is a far lower Vine, under and in the Service of Christ, and especially in the husbanding of it, there may be some such Branches as this Lord speaks of, which draw away Sapp and divert it, and make the Vine less fruitful; and no doubt but such Branches are to be cut off. So far I agree, and God forbid but I should. But then there are divers other Questions to be made and answered before this sharp Lord fall to cutting. As first, What Branches they be which are Exuberant and Superfluous (as this Lord is pleased to call them) What time is fittest to cut them off? Whe∣ther they be not such as with Pruning may be made fruitful? If not, then how near to the Body they are to be cut off? Whether this Lord may not be mistaken in the Branches which he thinks divert the Sapp? Whether a Company of Lay-Men without any Order or Ordinance from Christ, without any Example from the days of Christ, may, without the Church, take upon them to prune and order this Vine? For, whatever this Lord thinks in the over abundance of his own Sense, the Lord hath appointed Husbandmen to order and prune this Vine, and all the Branches of it, in his Church, without his Usurpation of their Office: And while he uses a Bill (which is too boisterous a Weapon for a Vine) instead of a Pruning-hook, the Church it self which is the Vine, which bears Episcopacy, may bleed to death in this Kingdom, before Men be aware of it. And
I am in great fear, if things go on as they are projected, that Reli∣gion is upon taking its leave of this Kingdom. But this Lord hath not quite done stating the Question, for he tells us next, That, The Question will be no more but this, Whether Bishops shall be re∣duced to what they were in their first advancement over the Pres∣byters (which although it were but a Humane device for the Remedy of Schism, yet were they in those times least offensive) or continue still with the addition of such things as their own Ambition, and the Ignorance and Superstition of succeeding times did add thereunto, and which are now continued for several Political Ends; things Heterogeneal and Inconsistent with their Calling and Function as they are Ministers of the Gospel, and thereupon such as ever have been, and ever will be hurtful to themselves, and make them hurtful to others in the times and places where they are continued. Here my Lord states the Question again. He did it before under the Metaphor of a Tree and the Branches. Here, that Men of narrow Comprehensions may not mistake him, he lays it down in plain Terms, and tells us, the Question is no more but this, Whether Bishops shall be reduced to what they were in their first advancement over the Presbyters? And you may be sure they shall be reduc'd if they once fall into the Hands of this Zealous Lord. Reduc'd out of doubt every way, if he may have his will, saving to that which they were in the Original, which his Lordship calls their first advancement over the Presbyters. For my own part, if it be thought fit to reduce the Christian Church to her first Beginnings, give us the same power, and use us with the same Reverence for our Works sake, as then our Predecessours were used, and reduce us in God's name when you will. But this Lord's Zeal burns quite another way. He tells us indeed, that the Question is no more, but whether Bishops shall be re∣duced to what they were in their first Advancement over the Pres∣byters; but he means nothing less than their reducement thither: and this is manifest out of his own next Words. For there he says, their first advancement was but a Humane Device for avoiding of Schism. But a Humane Device? Why first, our Saviour himself chose twelve Apostles out of the whole number of his Disciples, and made them Bishops, and advanced over the Presbyters, and all other believing Christians, and gave them the Name of Bishops as well as of Apostles; as appears, since that Name was given even to Judas also, as well as to the other Apostles, and to the other Apostles as well as to Judas, since Matthias was chosen by God himself, both into the Bishoprick and Apostleship of Judas, Acts 1. 20, 24, 25. Now that Christ himself did ordain the Apostles over the ordinary Disciples, Presbyters or others, is evident also in the very Text; for he chose them out of his S. Luke, 6. 13. . Disciples, S. Luk. 6. And to what end was this chusing out, if after this choise they remained no more than they were before? Nay, he chose them out with a special Ordination to a higher Function; as appears S. Mar. 3. where 'tis said, He ordained twelve that they should be with him; that is, in a higher and nearer Relation than the rest were. Nay more than so, the Word there used by S. Mark
is , he made them; he made them somewhat which before that making they were not; that is, Apostles and Bishops. Had they been such before, it could not have been said that he made them then. And our last Translation renders it very well, He Ordained them: so belike this Making was a new Ordination of them. And this appears farther by the choice of Matthias into the Apostleship of Judas: For Euseb. L. 1. Hist. c. 12. & L. 2. c. 1. Matthias was one of the Seventy when he was cho∣sen; and then this choice needed not, if the LXX had been before of equal Place and Calling with the Apostles. For as S. Jerome speaks, S. Hieron. Ep. ad Occan. he that is preferred, is preferr'd de Minori ad Majus, from a less and a lower, to a greater and a higher Degree. Now it is Traditio Vni∣versalis, the constant and universal Tradition of the whole Church of Christ, which is of greatest Autho∣rity next to Scripture it self, that Apud nos Apostolorum locum tenent Episcopi; apud eos (i. e. Moutani Sectatores) Episcopus tertius est. S. Hier. Ep. ad Marcel. adv. Montan. Patres missi sunt Apostoli, pro Apostolis filii nati sunt, ibi constituti sunt Episcopi. S. Aug. in Psal. 44. Sicut autem duodecim Apostolos forman Episcopo∣rum praemonstrare nemo est qui dubiter, sic & hos LXXII figuram Presbyterorum, i. e. secundi Ordinis Sacerdotium egessisse sciendum est. Beda in Luc. 10. Apostoli cognoverunt contentionem de Nomine E∣piscopatûs oboriturum, & ideo constituerunt praedictos, & cum consensu Universae Ecclesiae. Clem. Ep. 1. ad Corinth. p. 57. But I am prevented here by a Chaplain of mine,  Jer. Taylor, in his Book entituled Episcopacy Asserted; §. 10. Bi∣shops are Successors of the Apostles, and Presbyters made in resemblance of the LXX Disciples. And so the Institution of Christ himself (for so by this Lord's leave I shall ever take Epi∣scopacy to be) is made but a Humane Device to avoid Schism. But there hath been so much written of late to prove Episcopacy no Humane Device, that I will not trouble the Reader with any more of it here: only we are thus far beholding to this Lord, that he thinks Bishops were in those times least offensive; so belike in the Apostles times they were offensive, though less. And this makes me doubt, he thinks as much of the Apostles themselves, since they were so ambitious as to take on them Superiority over their Brethren, which this great Lord of the Separation, (for so he is) cannot endure, as being Antichristian, and therefore certainly (if he may have his Will) will reduce the Bishops farther yet, till they be of his Marring and not of Christ's Making. The other part of the Question stated by this Lord, is, Or whether the Bishops shall continue still with the additon of such things as their own Ambition, and the Ignorance and Superstition of succeeding times, did add unto them. I would my Lord had been pleased to tell us what those things are, which he says are thus added unto them. I should much the better have seen what his Lordship aims at, and been able to come up the closer to him. Now I must be forced to answer him in general. That there are many things of Honour and Profit, which Emperours and great Kings have conferred upon Bishops to the better Settlement of their Calling, and the great advancement of Christianity; and for which Bishops in all times and places, in which they have lived, have been both thankful and very serviceable. And I could give many instances in this Kingdom of such Services done by them, as this Lord and all his Posterity will never equal. But what things their own Ambition or the Ignorance and Superstition of succeeding times have added to them, I may know when this busie Lord is at leisure to tell me. In the mean time I doubt the
Piety and Devotion of these times is here miscalled Ignorance and Superstition, while the Knowledge of these times, in too many, is a running headlong into Sacrilege, as the best way to cure Superstition. But these things, what ever they be, his Lordship tells us, are now continued for several politick Ends. Yea, and with his Lordship's favour, for several and great Religious Ends too. But if they were con∣tinued for Politick Ends only, so the Policyes be good and befitting Christians, I know no Reason why they may not be continued. For, as for that which is here given by this Lord, 'tis either weak or false. He says these things are Heterogeneal to their Function, that's weak. For, 'tis not possible for any Priest, that is not Cloistered, to live so in the World, as to meddle with nothing that is Heterogeneal to their Function. And he says farther, that these things are inconsistent with their Function; and that's false. For if these things were simply inconsistent with Priesthood, God himself would never have made Ely both Priest and Judge in Israel: Nor should Bertram de Polit. Jud. c. 6. Six of each Tribe have been of the Sanhedrim, and so by Consequence Six of the Tribe of Levi; and so the High Priest might be always one, and a chief in that great Court, which had Cognizance of all things in that Government: And their Functions, as they are Ministers of the Gospel, is no more inconsistent with these things than the Levitical Preisthood was. For beside their Sacrificing, they were to read and expound the Law, as well as we the Gospel. For so it is expresly set down, Deut. 33. 10. They (that is, the Tribe of Levi,) shall teach Jacob thy Judgments, and Israel thy Laws. So that medling with Temporal Affairs was as great a Distraction to them from their Calling, as from ours; and as inconsistent with it, and so as hurtful to their Consciences and their Credits. And would God put all this upon them, which this Lord thinks so unlawful for us, if it were so indeed? But this Lord goes yet farther, and tells us, that these things are such as have ever been, and will ever be hurtful to themselves, and make them hurtful to others in the times and places where they are continued. Good God! what fools we poor Bishops are, as were also our Predecessours for many hundred years together, that neither they nor we could see and discern, what was and is hurtful to our selves, nor what then did, or yet doth make us hurtful to others, in times and places where they are continued to us? And surely, if my Lord means by this our medling in Civil Affairs, when our Prince calls us to it (as I believe he doth) I doubt his Lordship is much deceived. For certainly, if herein the Bishops do their Duties, as very many of them in several Kingdoms have plentifully done, they cannot hurt themselves by it; and to others, and the very Publick it self, it hath occasioned much good both in Church and State. But now my Lord will not only tell us what these things are, but he will prove it also that they are hurtful to us. And these things alone (says my Lord) this Bill takes away; that is, their Offices and Places in Courts of Judicature, and their Employ∣ment by Obligation of Office in Civil Affairs. I shall insist upon this to shew, First, how these things hurt themselves, and Secondly, how they have made and ever will make them hurtful to others.
These things then you see which are so hurtful and dangerous to Bishops themselves, and make them as hurtful to others, are their Offices, and Places in Courts of Judicature, and their Employment by Obligation of Office in Civil Affairs. Where, First, for Offices; I know no Bishop since the Reformation that hath been troubled with any, but only Dr. Juxon, when Bishop of London, was Lord High Treasurer of England, for about Five Years. And he was made when the King's Affairs were in a great strait; and, to my knowledge, he car∣ried so, that if he might have been left to himself, the King might have been preserved from most of those Difficulties, into which he after fell for want of Money. As all Kings shall be hazarded, more or less, in some time or other of their Reign, and much the more if their Purses be empty, and they forced to seek Aid from their Subjects. And this, as 'tis every where true, yet 'tis most true in England. As for Places in Courts of Judicature, the Bishops of England have ever sat all of them in Parliament, the highest Court, ever since Par∣liaments were in England. And whatsoever is now thought of them, they have in their several Generations done great Services there: And, as I conceive, it is not only fit but necessary they should have Votes in that great Court; howsoever the late Act hath shut them out; and that Act must in time be repealed, or it shall undoubtedly be worse for this Kingdom than yet it is. The Bishops sat in no other Courts, but the Star Chamber, and the High Commission. And of these the High Commission was most proper for them to sit, and see Sin pu∣nish'd: For no Causes were handled there but Ecclesiastical, and those such as were very heinous, either for the Crime it self, or the Per∣sons which committed it, being too great or too wilful to be ruled by the inferiour Jurisdictions. As for the Star Chamber, there were or∣dinarily but two Bishops present, and it was fit some should be there: For that Court was a mix'd Court of Law, Equity, Honour and Con∣science, and was compos'd of Persons accordingly from the very Original of that Court. For there were to be there two Judges to take care of the Laws, and two Bishops to look to the Conscience, and the rest Men of great Offices or Birth, or both, to preserve the Honour, and all of them together to maintain the Equity of the Court. So here were but two Bishops employ'd, and those only twice a Week in Term time. As for the Council Table that was never accounted a Court, yet as Matters Civil were heard and often ended there, so were some Ecclesiastical too. But the Bishops were little honoured with this Trouble since the Reformation: For many times no Bishop was of the Council-Table, and usually not above two. Once in King James's time I knew Three, and once Four, and that was was the highest, and but for a short time. And certainly the fewer the better, if this Lord can prove (that which he says he will in∣sist upon) that those things are hurtful to themselves, and make them hurtful to others. And to do this he proceeds; They themselves art hurt thereby in their Conscience and in their Credits. In their Conscience, by seeking and admitting things which
are inconsistent with that Function and Office which God hath set them apart unto. His Lordship begins with this, That the Bishops are hereby hurt both in their Consciences and their Credits. Two great hurts indeed, if by these things they be wounded in their Consciences towards God, and in their Credits before Men. But I am willing to hope these are not real but imaginary hurts, and that this Lord shall not be able to prove it otherwise: Yet I see he is resolved to labour it as much as he can. And first, he would prove that these things, and not the ambitious seeking of them only, but the very admitting of them, though offer'd, or in a manner laid upon some of them by the Supream Power, are hurtful to their Consciences, because they are inconsistent with the Function to which God hath set them apart. But I have proved al∣ready, that they are not inconsistent with that Function, and so there's an end of this Argument. For Bishops, without neglect of their Calling, may spend those few Hours required of them, in giving their assistance in and to the forenamed Civil Affairs. And 'tis well known that S. Augustin did both in great Perfection, so high up in the Primitive Church, and in that Great and Learned Age: For he S. Aug. Ep. 110. complains that he had nor Fore-noon, nor After-noon free, he was so held to it, Occupationibus Hominum, by the Businesses which Men brought to him; and he desires that he may ease himself in part upon him that was at his desire designed his Successor; to which the Peo∣ple expressed their great liking, by their Acclamation. And these Businesses he dispatch'd with that great Dexterity to most Mens content, Et  quidam causas suas saeculares apud nos finire , &c. S. Aug. Epist. 147. & Amb. L. 5. Epist. 33. that Men did not only bring their Secular Causes before him, but were very desi∣rous to have him determine them. Non  quaetere ab eo poteram quod volebam ficut volebam, secludentibus me ab ejus Aure & Ore Catervis Negotiorum hominum, quorum infirmitatibus serviebat. S. Aug. L. 6. Confess. c. 3. Similiter Zozomen. refert de Epiphanio, L. 6. Hist. c. 3. Et de Jacobo quodam, Theod. L. 2. Hist. c. 30. Et de Chrysostomo, Socrat. L. 7. Hist. c. 8. Et Constantinus communicabat cum Episcopis Con∣silia de Expeditione sua contra Persas. Euseb. L. 1. de Vita Constant. c. 35. And S. Ambrose was in greater Employment for Secular Affairs than S. Augustin was, for he was Bishop and Governour of Milan both at once; and was so full of this Employment, that S. Augustin, being then upon the Point of his Con∣version, complains he could not find him at so much leisure as he would. And this, besides many Bishops and Clergy-Men of great Note, who have been employ'd in great Embassics, and great Offices under Emperors and Kings, and discharged them with great Fidelity and Advantage to the Publick, and without detriment to the Church. And surely they would never have taken this Burthen upon them, had their Conscience been hurt by it, or had it been inconsistent with their Function, or absolutely against the ancient Canons of the Church, of which they were so conscientious and strict Observers. My Lord goes on to another Argument and tells us; They are separated unto a special Work, and Men must take heed how they mis-employ things dedicated, and set apart to the Service of
God. They are called to Preach the Gospel, and set apart to the Work of the Ministery; and the Apostle saith, Who is sufficient for these things? Shewing that this requireth the Whole Man: and all is too little. Therefore for them to seek or take other Offices, which shall require and tie them to employ their Time and Studies in the Affairs of this World, will draw a Guilt upon them, as being inconsistent with that which God doth call them, and set them apart unto. This is my Lord's next Argument: And truly I like the begin∣ning of it very well, and I pray God this Lord may be mindful of it when time may serve. For surely Men ought to take heed how they mis-employ Things dedicated and set apart to the Service of God. And therefore, as Ministers must not mis-employ their Per∣sons or their Times, which are dedicated to God and his Service; no more must Lay-Men take away and mis-employ the Church Re∣venues devoutly given, dedicated and set apart to maintain and hold up the Service of God, and to refresh Christ in his poor Mem∣bers upon Earth. And if ever a Scambling time come for the Church-Lands (as these Times hereafter must) I hope his Lordship will re∣member this Argument of his, and help to hold back the Violence from committing more Sacrilege, whereas too much lies heavy on the Kingdom already. The rest of the Argument will abide some Examination. First then, most true it is, that Bishops are called to Preach the Gospel, and set apart to that Work; but whether they be so set apart, as that what Necessity soever requires it, they may do nothing else but Study and Preach, is no great Question. For certainly, they may in Times of Persecution labour many ways for their Perservation, and in Times of Want for their Sustenance, and at all Times (if they be cal∣led to it) give their best Counsel and Advice for the publick Safety of the State as well as their own. Nor doth that of the Apostle, 2 Cor. 2. 16. Who is sufficient for these things? hinder this at all. For though this great Calling and Charge requires the whole Man, though all that the ablest Man can do in it, be too little (all things simply and exactly consider'd) yet he that saith here, None are sufficient for these things, (for so much the Question implieth) saith also in the very next Chapter, that God hath made him and others able Ministers of the New Testament, 2 Cor. 3. 6. and if able, then doubtless sufficient. And the Greek word is the same, , sufficient in the one place, and , made us sufficient in the other: Besides, it may be the sense of the Places will bear it; that no Man is sufficient for the Dignity of the Office, which brings with it the savour of Life or Death to all Men, and yet that many Men are made sufficient by God's Grace to per∣form this Office; that is, to bring both the one and the other. But howsoever, be the Office as high as it is, and be the Men never so sufficient, yet the Function is such as cannot be daily performed by the Priest for the Preaching part, nor attended by the People for their other necessary Employments of Life, which made the Wisdom of God himself command a Sabbath under the Law, and the Church
to settle the Lord's-Day, and other Holy-days under the Gospel, for the Publick Service and Worship of God, and the Instruction of the People. I say, in regard of this, a Bishop or a Priest who shall be judged fit for that Publick Service, may give Counsel in any Civil Af∣fairs, and take upon him (if not seek) any Office temporal, that may help and assist him in his Calling, and give him Credit and Counte∣nance to do the more good among his People, but not to the deser∣tion of his Spiritual Work. And this Lord is much deceived if he thinks all Offices do require and tie them to employ their Time and Studies in the Affairs of this World. If they be such Offices as do, I grant with him, that to take them (unless it be upon some urgent Necessity) may draw a Guilt upon them: But if they be such as Clergy-Men may easily execute in their empty Hours, without any great hindrance to their Calling, and perhaps with great Advantage to it, then, out of doubt, it can draw no Guilt upon them which take them. And this Lord in this Passage is very cunning: For, instead of speaking of Bishops having any thing to do in Civil Affairs, he speaks of nothing but taking of Offices. Now a Clergy-Man may many ways have to do in Temporal Affairs, without taking any set Office upon him, which shall not tie up his Time or his Studies to the Affairs of this World, as it seems this Lord would persuade the the World all do. Now that a Bishop or other Clergy-Man may lawfully meddle with some Temporal Affairs (always provided that he , implicatur. entangle not him∣self with them; for that indeed no Man doth that Wars for Christ as he ought, 2 Tim. 2. 4.) is, I think, very evident, not only by that which the Priests did, and might do under the Law; but also by that which was done after Christ, in the Apostle's time, and by some of them. To Study and Practise Physick is as much inconsistent with the Function of a Minister of the Gospel, as to Sit, Consult, and give Counsel in Civil Affairs: But St. Luke, though an Evangelist, continued his Profession, as appears Colos. 4. 14. where St. Paul says thus, Luke the beloved Physician greets you; where St. Paul would never have called him a Physician had he left off that Calling to at∣tend the Gospel only. And S. Paul himself, when he might have lived on the Gospel by the Lord's own Ordinance, 1 Cor. 9. would never have betaken himself to live by making of Tents, Acts 18. only for a Convenience (as I conceive) that he might work the more upon the People while he charged them not, if in so doing he had found it a hindrance to his Preaching the Gospel: And this Lord and others, who would not have Ministers meddle with Civil Af∣fairs, are content, not only to the Disgrace of the Ministery, but even of Religion it self, to hear Felt-makers, and Iron-mongers, and Gardiners, and Brewers, Clerks, and Coachmen preach God knows what Stuff, and countenance them in this Sacrilegious Presumption. Nay, and are never troubled that these Men have all their time taken up in the Affairs of the World, but rather say their Gifts are the greater, that they are able to do both. Out of doubt they hope that their Coachmen-Preachers shall hurry them to Heaven in some Fiery Chariot; and I my self in time might be brought to believe it too, did I not
see Phaeton setting the Christian World on fire, but no Elias there. Nor yet will S. Paul's Example any whit advantage them: For he was no ignorant Tradesman, but a learned Pharisee brought up under Gamaliel, Acts 22. And it was the Custom of their Doctors (as it is at this Day in Turkey, and many other places in the East.) to breed up their Scholars to a Trade as well as to the Knowledge of their Law; both that they might know the better how to spend their empty Hours honestly, and be able to get their Living should Neces∣sity overtake them. Now let these bold Men shew under what Ga∣maliel they were bred, and how they profited under him; or that they have S. Paul's Revelation as well as his Trade, and then I'll say more to them. But this Lord is very full in this Theam, and falls upon another Argument. In this respect (saith he) our Saviour hath expresly prohibited it, telling his Apostles that they should not Lord it over their Brethren, nor Exercise Jurisdiction over them, as was used in Civil Govern∣ments among the Heathen. They were called Gracious Lords, and exercised Jurisdiction, as Lords, over others; and sure they might lawfully do so. But to the Ministers of the Gospel our Saviour gives this Rule, It shall not be so done to you; if you strive for Great∣ness, he shall be Greatest that is the greatest Servant to the rest. Therefore in another place he saith, He that putteth his hand to the Plough, and looketh back to the things of this World, is not fit for the Kingdom of God; that is, the Preaching of the Gospel, as it is usually called. This Argument will be somewhat indeed, if it proves such as this Lord says it is. For he says that our Saviour hath expresly prohi∣bited it: and if it be so, there's an end of the Controversie. No Question but it is utterly unlawful if our Saviour prohibited it. But where is it that he hath done so? Where? Why 'tis where he tells his Apostles, that they should not Lord it over their Brethren. Not Lord it over their Brethren? that's true: Nor exercise Jurisdiction over them? that's false, if the Proposition be general; for then there can be no Order, no Government among Church-Men. And if it be particular, no such Jurisdiction as was used in Civil Government among the , then 'tis fit to weigh this place through and throughout. Well then! the Mother of Zebedee's Children desired of Christ for her two Sons, that the one might sit at his right hand, and the other at his left hand in his Kingdom, S. Matth. 20. 21. Where first it appears plainly, that this was not only a piece of Feminine Ambition, for her Sons made the suit as well as she; so S. Mark 10. 35. tells us; and they came with her when she made it. So St. Matth. 20. 20. And little doubt need be made but that they set their Mother on to move it, as may appear partly by our Saviour, who says nothing to the Mother, but first puts a Question to the Sons, which they answer, and then gives his Answer to them, Ver. 22, 23. which (I conceive) he would not have done, had not they been in the Business: And partly, because the other Ten Or were  with . ; disdained at the two Brethren for this, Ver. 24. Secondly, if it were here meant by
them, to sit at his right hand and at his left in his Kingdom in Heaven, as may be thought not altogether improbable by the Question Christ puts to them about his Baptism and his Cup, both preparatory to that Kingdom. And if it be so (and so some think it is) then this Text is applied by this Lord to no purpose, if it meddles nothing with Temporal Offices and Employments, but relates to the King∣dom of Heaven. But if they meant by this sitting at his right Hand and at his left, the honourable Places about him in his Earthly Kingdom, which the Apostles sometimes fancied he should here have, as some think, because of the other part of Christ's Answer, that the Princes of the Gentiles exercise Dominion over them, but it shall not be so amongst you, ver. 25, 26. Then the Answer is clear, that Christ did not here forbid them the taking of such Places upon them simply, but he forbids either an absolute independent Power; for so  signifies, which takes not away Superiority over others, so they be subject to the Prince and State. Or else the using of such Places after the Lordly and Tyrannous Manner of some Heathens. And the Geneva Divines in their Notes upon the Bible tell us, That the meaning of Christ's Answer to them in these words, to sit at my right hand at my left is not mine to give, ver. 23. is, that God the Fa∣ther Annot. in St. Matth. 20. 23. had not given him Charge to bestow Offices of Honour here, but to be an Example of Humility to all. So Christ came not then to give such Places; but here's no Prohibition for the Apostles to take them at their Hands who would give them for the good of the Church. And howsoever, if this place must be understood of Tem∣poral Honours and Employments, then it follows, that though these two Apostles had not those Seats, some other of them should. For Christ says plainly, That the sitting at his right Hand and at his left shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by his Father. So then it shall be given to some, and doubtless to some of the Apostles: Strangers should not be preferred before them. And 'tis all one to our present Business, which of the Apostles sat there, so some did, or were to do; and rather than yield this, his Lordship perhaps were better grant, that this is to be understood of another Kingdom, and that this Text meddles with no Temporal either Offices or Employ∣ments, but that by occasion of this our Saviour preaches Humility to them, yet so as still to keep up Authority and Government in the Church, to which he applies it. And for that other parallel Place, be ye not called Rabbi, S. Matth. 23. 8. that cannot prejudice all Juridiction in Men in Holy Orders; as if to meddle with it were forbidden by Christ, or, as if it were Antichristian, as now 'tis made; since it is plain that Christ there for∣bids neither the Title, nor the Preheminence, nor the Authority, but the Vain-glorious Affectation of it, ver. 5, 6. and that's a Sin indeed, no Man doubts. And it may be observed too, if this Lord pleases, that this Precept was given to the People too, as well as to the Disciples, ver, 1. and then, for ought I know, this Truth will come in as strongly to pull down Temporal Lords, as Bishops; and what will his Lordship say to that? As for that which is added by this Lord, If ye strive for Greatness, he shall be greatest who is the greatest Servant to the rest: Though the
words differ somewhat from the Text, yet my Lord must be content to hear, that there is a twofold Greatness; the one in God's account, and that's Greatness indeed: And so our Saviour means it here, that he is Greatest who is the greatest Servant to the rest, (if this Lord will needs read it so:) The other is in Man's account, when one Man hath Power and Superiority over another; and which was that which the Apostles affected. In which case, though our Saviour's Precept be, Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your Servant; that is, the more serviceable to you and the Church, the greater he is; yet these words (it shall not be so with you) do not deny this Authority or Greatness which one may have over another in the Church of Christ for the necessary Government thereof, though they neither do nor may Domineer over their Brethren. And therefore where St. Mat∣thew St. Matth. 20. 26, 27. reads it, he that will be, , great, and, , first among you; there St. Luke hath it, , greater, and, And St. Paul uses it for a Bi∣shop or Governor, Heb. 13. 1. , Chief or Lea∣der. St. Luke 22.26. Nor doth he say so as St. Matthew does, he that would be so, but, he that is, which argues clearly, that even in our Saviour's own account and Institution too, there was then, and should be after his Ascension greater and less, such as were to lead, and such as were to be led. No Parity, and yet no barbarous Lording; but orderly and Christian Governing in the Church. And this must needs be so, or else Christ lest his Church in a worse Condition, than this Lord ac∣knowledges the Civil Governments were among the Heathen, which he says might lawfully govern so. For I hope he will not say that even the Heathen might tyrannize. If this be not sufficient, this Lord puts us in mind that our Sa∣viour says in another place, That he which lays his hand to the Plough, and looks back to the things of this World, is not sit for the King∣dom of God; that is, the Preaching of the Gospel, as 'tis usually called, St. Luke 9. ult. Where, first, it may be doubted whether this laying of the hand to the Plough belong to the Ministers of the Gospel only, or to others also. For if it belongs to others as well as to them (though perhaps not so much) then no Christian, though he be not a Minister, may have to do with Worldly Affairs; and then we shall have a devout wise World quickly. Secondly, it may be doubted too whether this looking back be any kind of meddling at all with worldly Affairs, or such a meddling as shall so entangle the Husbandman that his Plough stands still, or so bewitches him, that he forsakes his Plough, that is, his Calling altogether. If it be no meddling at all, no Man can live; if it be no meddling, but that which entangles, then any Minister may meddle with Worldly Af∣fairs, so far and so long as he entangles not himself with them: And so far as to entangle himself, no Christian may meddle, that will live Godly in Christ Jesus. If this be not sufficient, this Lord will prove it e'er he hath done, for he goes on. To be thus withdrawn, by entangling themselves with the Affairs of this Life, by the Necessity and Duty of an Office receiv'd from Men, from the Discharge of that Office which God hath called them to, brings a Woe upon them. Woe unto me (saith the Apostle) if I
Preach not the Gospel. What doth he mean? If I Preach not once a Quarter, or once a Year in the King's Chapel? No. He himself interprets it, preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season; rebuke, exhort or instruct with all long-Suffering and Do∣ctrine. He that hath an Office must attend on his Office, especially this of the Ministery. I see my Lord will not mend his Terms, though they marr the Sense, and mislay the Question. For no Man says that which this Lord so often repeats; namely, that a Bishop or any other Clergy-Man may entangle himself with the Affairs of this Life (which yet may be with Covetousness and Voluptuous Living, as much or more than with being called to Council in Civil Affairs) by any Office re∣ceived from Man, from the discharge of that Office, which God hath called them unto. No! God forbid! this would bring a Woe upon them indeed. But since no Man says it, this Lord fights here with his own Shadow. For all that is said is this, that a Bishop being grown old and full of Experience, if the King, or the State in which he lives, thinks him for his Wisdom, Experience and Fidelity fit to be employed in Civil Councils or Affairs, be it with an Office or without, the Bishop may lawfully undertake this, so he be able to discharge it without deserting the Office which God and his Church have laid upon him. But if he takes it, and be not able to discharge both; or being able, doth loiter and not discharge them; either of these is Vitium Hominis, the fault of the Person, but the thing is lawful. As for the place of Scripture which his Lordship adds, I doubt his Lordship understands it not as the Apostle means it; for 'tis a Text very much abused by ignorant Zeal. For when he saith, Woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel, 1 Cor. 9. 16. what doth he mean? if he Preach not once a Quarter? No sure, that's too seldom. What then? if he Preach not once a Year in the King's Chapel? No sure, much less. For in those days there was no King in Corinth, nor any where else, that was Christian, to have a Chapel to Preach in. So this Lord might have let this Scorn alone, had it so pleased him. No; nor is it if a Man Prate not three or four times a Week in one of his Lordship's Independent Congregations, and then call it Preach∣ing: The Apostle knew no such Schismatical Conventicles. No sure, None of this. Why but what is this Preaching then, the neglect where∣of draws this Woe after it? This he tells you St. Paul interprets him∣self, 2 Tim. 4. 2. 'tis to Preach the Word. 'Tis indeed, and neither Schism nor Sedition, which are the common Themes of these Times. 'Tis to be instant in Preaching the Word, as God gives Ability and Opportunity; 'tis to be instant in season and out of season; that is, to take God's Opportunity rather than our own, and not Preach out of season only, as some of this Lord's great Favourites use to do; 'tis to rebuke, exhort and instruct with Knowledge and Gravity, and not spend Hours in idle and empty Discourses. And all this is to be done with all long-Suffering and Doctrine; and let the Clergy but study hard, and provide that their Doctrine be sound and good, and I will pass my word this Lord and his Friends shall take order
they shall do it with all the long Suffering that may be; and if they do not suffer enough, or not long enough, it shall not be his Fault, so dearly doth he love that they should Preach the Word. Nay, I must go farther yet. To preach the Word in this manner, is not only to go up into the Pulpit, and thence deliver wholsom and pious Instructions, and necessary and Christian Reproof, though this be, as the commendable, so the ordinary way of publick Preaching, that most at once may hear. For he may be said to Preach the Gospel, that any ways declares Christ , and informs the Un∣derstandings and Consciences of Men, for right Belief and true Obedience, be it privately or publickly; be it by word of Mouth or by Writing: and a Man may be seasonably instant this way sometimes, when in the publick way of Preaching he cannot. And if this be not so, how is it said of the Apostles, Acts 5. 42. that in the Temple and in every House, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus Christ, Acts. 20. 20. I have taught you publickly, and from House to House. And I believe some Bishops, whom this Lord in this passage is pleased to jeer at, have preached more and to more purpose, than any of his Lordship's Divinity-darlings. That which follows is true, that he which hath an Office, must wait upon his Office, Rom. 12. 7. and especially this of the Ministery; of which Office there the Apostle principally treats. But this again no Man denies. And yet by his Lordship's good leave, no Man is bound to starve by waiting upon his Office. He must wait upon it, that's true; but he must provide necessarys too, that he may be able to wait. Next this Lord tells us, The Practice of the Apostles is answerable to the Direction and Doctrine of our Saviour. There never was, nor will be, Men of so great Abilities and Gifts as they were endued withal, yet they thought it so inconsistent with their Calling, to take Places of Judi∣cature in Civil Matters, and Secular Affairs and Employments upon them, that they would not admit of the Care and Distraction that a business far more agreable to their Callings than these would cast upon them, and they give the Reason of it in the Sixth of the Acts, v. 2. It is not Reason that we should leave the Word of God, and serve Tables. There is no doubt but that the Practice of the Apostles was answer∣able to the Direction and Doctrine of our Saviour. And as certain∣ly true it is, that there never were, nor ever will be, Men of so great Abilities and Gifts, in Supernatural and Heavenly things especial∣ly, as they were endued withal. But how will this Lord prove, that they thought it a thing absolutely inconsistent with their Cal∣lings to meddle with Temporal or Civil Affairs. No one of them hath in any place of Scripture expressed so much. Against entan∣gling themselves with the World and the Affairs of it, I confess they have, but no more. Yet this Lord proves it thus: They would not admit of the Care and Distraction, that a business far more agreeable to their Calling than these would cast upon them. His Lordship means the Deacon's Office: And therefore surely they would not take these. But this Argument by his Lordship's leave is inconsequent:
For if any Offices or Employments, how agreeable soever to their Calling, bring with them such Care and Distraction as shall in a man∣ner quite take them off from Preaching the Gospel, the Apostles did not, and their Successours may not trouble themselves with them: When as yet the Apostles might, and their Successours may take on them other Employments, though in their Nature less agreeable to their Calling, if they be less distractive from it. Now the Deacon's Office (as it was then) brought more trouble upon them for the Poor and the Widows, than any Places of Judicature or Council do upon Clergy-men now. Which may appear by the very Reason they have given, and here remembred, that it was no Reason they should leave the Word of God and serve Tables. For there it is not said, that they might not at all meddle with the ordering of those Tables, but that it was not fit they should so meddle with them as  — leaving the word of God to attend them. And this to do no Man says is lawful now. But his Lordship presses this Argument yet farther. And again, when they had appointed them to choose Men fit for that business, they institute an Office rather for taking Care of the Poor, than they by it would be distracted from the principal Work of their Calling, and then shew how they ought to apply themselves: But we (say they) will give ourselves continually unto Prayer, and to the Ministery of the Word. Did the Apostles, Men of extraordi∣nary Gifis, think it unreasonable for them to be hinder'd from giving themselves continually to preaching the Word and Prayer, by taking care for the Tables of Poor Widows; and can Bishops now think it reasonable or lawful for them to contend for sitting at Council Tables, to govern States, to turn States-men instead of Churchmen, to sit in the highest Courts of Judicature, and to be employed in making Laws for Civil Polities and Government? It is true indeed that the Apostles appointed the Disciples to choose Men fit for that business, and that they did institute the Office of Deacons to take care of the Poor, rather than they would be di∣stracted from the principal Work of their Calling. But when was this done? When? Why not till the Disciples were multiplied; not till there arose Contentions between the Greeks and the Hebrews, that that their Widows were neglected in the daily Ministration, Acts 6. 1. Therefore till the Work grew so heavy, and the Contentions so warm, the Apostles themselves did order those Tables, and attend them too. Therefore the Work was not unlawful in its self for them, for then it had been Sin in them to do it at all at any time. For that which is simply evil in, and of it self, is ever so; therefore the most that can be made of this Example is, that it was lawful, very lawful and and charitable too, for the Apostles to take care of those Tables them∣selves; and they did it. For all the Provision for the Poor was brought and laid at the Apostles feet, Acts 4. 35. which doubtless would never have been done, had it been unlawful for the Apostles to order and to distribute it. But when they found the encreasing Burthen too heavy for both the one Work and the other, then,
though both were lawful, yet it was more expedient to leave the Tables than the Word of God, with which the World was then as little acquainted, as now 'tis full of; (and I pray God it be not full to a dangerous Surfeit.) Now this, as I conceive in Humility, states the Bishops Business: For to me it seems out of Question, that it is most lawful for Bishops to be conversant in all the Courts, Councils, and Places of Judicature, to which they have been called since the Reformation in the Church and State of England, till they find themselves, or be found unable to discharge the one Duty and the other. And then indeed I grant no serving of Tables, no nor Council Tables is to be preferred. But then you must not mea∣sure Preaching only by a formal going up into the Pulpit: For a Bishop (and such Occasions are often offer'd) may Preach the Go∣spel more publickly, and to far greater Edisication in a Court of Ju∣dicature, or at a Council Table, where great Men are met together to draw things to an Issue, than many Preachers in their several Charges can; and therefore to far more Advancement of the Gospel, than any one of his Lordship's Sect at a Tables end in his Lordship's Parlour, or in a Pulpit in his Independent Congregation, wheresoever it be. And when he hath said all that he can, or any Man else, this shall be found true, that there is not the like Necessity of Preaching the Gospel lying upon every Man in Holy Orders, now Christianity is spread and hath taken Root, as lay upon the Apostles and Aposto∣lical Men, when Christ and his Religion were Strangers to the whole World. And yet I speak not this to cast a Damp or Chilness upon any Man's Zeal or Diligence in that Work: No, God forbid! For, though I conceive there is not the same Necessity, yet a great Neces∣sity there is still, and ever will be, to hold  both the Verity and Devotion which attend Religion; and — Non  est Virtus, quam quaerere, parta tueri. So there may be as great Vertue in the Action, though perhaps not equal Necessity of it. Besides, Deacons were not Lay Men, but Men in Holy Orders, though inferiour to the Apostles; as appears by Stephen's under∣taking Acts . . Acts 8. 5. . Acts 6. 6. the Libertines and Cyrenians in the Cause of Christ; and Philip's Preaching of Christ in Samaria, and Baptizing. And if they were of the Seventy (as Epiphanius thinks they were, Haer.) then they were Presbyters before they had this Temporary Office (if such it were) put upon them. Therefore, if to meddle with these things were simply unlawful in themselves, or for Men in Holy Orders: Or, if all meddling with them were such a Distraction, as must needs make them leave the Preaching of the Gospel, then these Seventy might not discharge the Office to which they were chosen; and if this be so, then this Lord must needs infer that the Apo∣stles, and all which chose them, did sin in Instituting such Men to take care of the Tables, and to distract them from Preaching of the Word; which they thought unfit for themselves to do. And yet, I hope, my Lord will not say this in his privatest Conventicle. Nay, yet more; though this Care was delivered over to the Deacons in ordinary, yet Calvin tells us plainly, that in things of moment they Calvin in Acts 21. could do nothing — Nec quicquam — without the Authority of the Presbyters. So they meddled still.
Next this Lord shews, since the Apostles did not think fit to distract themselves with Business about these Tables, how they ought to ap∣ply themselves. And this he sets down in the Apostle's Words, Acts 6. 4. But we will give our selves continually to Prayer, and the Mini∣stery of the Word. And yet I hope this Lord doth not think the A∣postles by this word continually, meant to do nothing else but Pray and Preach: For if they did one of these two continually without any intermission, then they could do nothing else, which is most ap∣parently false. And indeed (which it seems this learned Lord con∣sidered not) this word continually is not in the Text. For in the Greek the word is , we will be constant and instant in Prayer and Ministration of the Word; which may and ought to be done, though neither of them continually; and which many of God's Servants have done, and yet meddled some way or other with tempo∣ral or worldly Affairs. The Argument is over: The rest of this Passage is this Lord's Rhe∣torick, which I shall answer as I repeat it. Did the Apostles (saith his Lordship) Men of extraordinary Gifts, think it unreasonable for them to be hindred from giving themselves continually to Preaching the Word and Prayer, by taking care of the Tables of the poor Widows? No; sure they they did not think it unreasonable; that is this Lord's word to make the present business of the Bishops more Odious, as if it were a∣gainst common Reason. But there's no such word in the Text. The word is, , it is not meet. Now many things may not be meet or comely, which yet are not altogether unreasonable: Nay, which at some times, and upon some occasions, may be meet and comely enough; nay, perhaps necessary for the very Gospel it self, and therefore no way unreasonable; howsoever at this time unfit for the Apostles, and worthily refused by them. Well; the Rhetorick goes on. Did the Apostles thus, and can the Bishops now think it reasonable or lawful for them? Yes, the Times and Circumstances being varied, and many things become fit which in some former Times were not, they can think it both reasonable and lawful, nay, necessary for some of them. What? To contend for sit∣ting at Council Tables? No; God forbid, perhaps not to sue for sit∣ting there, but certainly not to contend for it; but to sit there being called unto it, and to give their best Advice there, never unlawful, and oft-times necessary: And here let me tell this Lord by the way, that the Bishop which he hath sufficiently hated, was so far from con∣tending for this, that though he had that Honour given him by His Majesty to sit there many Years, yet I do here take it upon my Christiani∣ty and Truth, that he did never move His Majesty directly or indirect∣ly for that Honour, and was surprized with it as altogether unlook∣ed for, when His Majesty's Resolution therein was made known unto him. Nor ever did that Bishop take so much upon him, as a Justice∣ship of the Peace, or meddle with any Lay-Employment, save what the Laws and Customs of this Realm laid upon him in the High Com∣mission and the Star-Chamber, while those Courts were in being; and continued Preaching till he was Threescore and four, and then was taken off by Writing of his Book against Fisher the Jesuit, being then not able at those Years to continue both. And soon after the World
knows what trouble befel him, and in time they will know why too, I hope. Besides, the Care of Government, which is another part of a Bishop's Office, and a necessary one too, lay heavy upon him, in these Factious and broken Times especially. And whatsoever this Lord thinks of it, certainly, though Preaching may be more necessary for the first planting of a Church, yet Government is more noble and necessary too, where a Church is planted; as being that which must keep Preaching and all things else in order. And Preaching (as 'tis now used) hath as much need to be kept in order as any, even the greatest Extravagance that I know. Nor is this out of Christ's Com∣mission, Pasce Oves, John 21. 15. for the feeding of his Sheep. For a Shepherd must guide, govern, and defend his Sheep in the Pasture, as well as drive them to it. And he must see that their Pasture be not tainted too, or else they will not thrive upon it. And then he may be answerable for the Rot that falls among them. The Rhetorick goes farther yet. To contend for sitting at Council Tables to govern States. No, but yet to assist them being called by them. To have States-Men instead of Church-Men. No, but doing the Duty of Church-Men, to mingle pious Counsels with States-Mens Wisdom. To sit in the highest Courts of Judicature: And why not, in a Kingdom where the Laws and Customs require it? Not to be em∣ployed in making Laws for Civil Polities and Government. And I con∣ceive there is great Reason for this in the Kingdom of England, and greater since the Reformation than before. Great Reason, because the Bishops of England have been accounted, and truly been, grave and experienced Men, and far fitter to have Votes in Parliaments for the making of Laws, than many young Youths which are in either House: And because it is most fit in the making of Laws for a King∣dom, that some Divines should have Vote and Interest to see (as much as in them lies) that no Law pass, which may perhaps, though unseen to others, intrench upon Religion it self, or the Church. And I make no doubt but that these and the like Considerations settled it so in England, where Bishops have had their Votes in Parlia∣ments, and in making Laws, ever since there were Parliaments; yea, or any thing that resembled them in this Kingdom. And for my part, were I able to give no Reason at all why Bishops should have Votes in Parliament, yet I should in all Humility think that there was and is still some great Reason for it, since the Wisdom of the State hath successively in so many Ages thought it fit. And as there is great Reason they should have Votes in making Laws, so is there greater Reason for it since the Reformation than before. For before that time Clergy-Men were governed by the Church Canons and Constitutions, and the Common Laws of England had but little Power over them. Then in the Year 1532. the Clergy submitted; and an Act of Parliament was made upon it: So that ever since the Clergy of England, from the Highest to the Lowest, are as much sub∣ject to the Temporal Laws as any other Men, and therefore ought to have as free a Vote and Consent to the Laws which bind them, as other Subjects have. Yet so it is, that all Clergy-Men are and have long since been excluded from being Members of the House of Commons, and now the Bishops and their Votes, by this last Act, are cast out of
the Lord's House. By which it is at this Day come to pass, that by the Justice of England, as now it stands, no Clergy-Man hath a Con∣sent, by himself or his Proxy, to those Laws to which all of them are bound. In the mean time, before I pass from this Point, this Lord must give me leave to put him in mind of that which was openly spoken in both Houses; that the Reason why there was such a Clamour against the Bishops Votes was, because all or most of them Voted for the King, so that the potent Faction could not carry what they plea∣sed, especially in the Vpper House. And when some saw they could not have their Will to cast out their Votes fairly, the Rabble must come down again, and Clamour against their Votes; not without danger to some of their Persons. And come they did in Multitudes. But who procured their coming I know not, unless it were this Lord and his Followers. And notwithstanding this is as clear as the Sun, and was openly spoken in the House, that this was the true Cause only why they were so angry with the Bishops Votes; yet this most Godly and Religious Lord pretends here a far better Cause than this; namely, that they may, as they ought, carefully attend to the Preaching of the Word, and not be distracted from that great Work, by being troubled with these Worldly Affairs. And I make no doubt, but that the same Zeal will carry the same Men to the devout taking away the Bishops and the Church Lands, and perhaps the Parsons Tythes too, and put them to such Stipends as they shall think fit, that so they may Preach the Gospel freely, and not be drawn away with these Worldly Affairs from the prin∣cipal Work of that Function, Well! my Lord must give me leave here to Prophesie a little: and 'tis but this in short, Either the Bishops shall in few Years recover of this Hoarseness, and have their Honour and their Votes in Parliament again; or, before many Years be past, all Baseness, Barbarity and Confusion will go near to possess both this Church and Kingdom. But this Lord hath yet somewhat more to say; namely, that If they shall be thought fit to sit in such Places, and will undertake such Employments, they must not be there as ignorant Men, but must be knowing in Business of State; and understand the Rules and Laws of Government, and thereby both their Time and Studies must be ne∣cessarily diverted from that which God hath called them unto. And this surely is much more Vnlawful for them to admit of, than that which the Apostles rejected as a distraction unreasonable for them to be inter∣rupted by. Why but yet if they shall be thought fit to sit in such Places, and will undertake such Employments, what then? Why then they must not sit there as ignorant Men, but they must be knowing Men, and understand the Rules and Laws of Government. This is most true; and if any Man sit in those places as an Ignorant, 'tis an ill Choice that is made of him, and he doth not well that accepts them. But sure, if Bishops sit there as Ignorants, they are much to be blamed. For if they spend their younger Studies before they meddle with Divi∣nity,
as they may and ought, sure there is some great Defect in them, if they be not as knowing Men in the Rules of Government as most Noblemen or others are, who spend all their younger time in Hawking and Hunting, and somewhat else: And this younger time of theirs, if Bishops have spent as they ought, they may with a little Care and Observation, and without any great Diversion of their Time and Studies from that which God hath called them unto, perform those Places with great Knowledge and much Happiness to the States in which they serve, as hath formerly in this, and doth at present in other Neighbouring States appear. And for ought this Lord knows, if some Counsels had been followed, which some Bishops gave, neither the King, nor the State, nor the Church, had been in that ill Condition in which they now are. Nor are these Places more Unlawful for Bishops to admit of in these Times and Conditions of the Church, than that which the Apostles rejected as a Distraction, but not as an unreasonable one, in those Times and Beginnings of Christianity, as is proved before. But the Zeal of this Lord burns still, and as it hath fired him already out of the Church, and made him a Separatist; so it would now sire the Bishops out of the State, and make them Members of Antichrist. His Lordship goes on therefore, and as before he told us the Practice of the Apostles was answerable to the Doctrine of Christ, so here he tells us again; The Doctrine of the Apostles is agreeable to their Practice herein. For St. Paul, when he instructs Timothy for the Work of the Mini∣stery, presseth this Argument from the Example of a good Soldier: No Man that warreth entangleth himself with the Affairs of the World. The Doctrine of the Apostles is agreeable indeed to their Practice herein, and in all things else; and I would to God with all my Heart this Lord's Opinions were agreeable to either their Practice or their Doctrine; and then, I am sure, he would be a better Soldier for Christ, than this poor Church hath cause to believe he is. But his Lordship says that Paul when he instructs Timothy for the Work of the Ministery, presseth this Argument from the Example of a good 2 Tim. 2. 4. Soldier; That no Man that warreth, , entangles himself with the Affairs of the World. The word  signifies involvere & per∣miscere se, to involve and, as it were, throughly to mingle himself with that which he undertakes; to be so busied, ut extricare se non possit, that he cannot untwist himself out of the Employment: And I easily grant that no good Christian, much less any good Bishop, may so entangle himself with the World, as either to Desert his Calling, or to be so distracted from it, as not to do his Duty in it, Annot. ibid. But this bars not all meddling with it. For the Geneva Note upon that place says plainly, he may not extangle himself; no, not so much as with his Houshold and other ordinary Affairs. But then if he shall not meddle with, or take care of these at all, he may beg or starve, unless he have better Means than the Competency which this Devout Age thinks sufficient for the Ministery. Nay, which is more, he may by so doing fall under that heavy Sentence of the
Apostle, 1 Tim. 5. 8. That if he provide not for his own, he hath denied the Faith, and is worse than are Insidels. Nay, which is yet more, if all meddling with Temporal Affairs, all Care of the World be an Entanglement, the Clergy must needs be in a Perplexity whatsoever they do. For if they meddle with any Worldly Business, and en∣tangle themselves, they do that they ought not, 2 Tim. 2. 4. And if they do not meddle with Worldly Affairs, and so do not provide for their own; and provide they cannot without some meddling. Then, for sear of this Lord's sowr Divinity, that all meddling with is en∣tangling in them, they are worse than Infidels. Now a Perplexity which shall wrap a Man up in Sin which way soever he sets himself to Action, is so contrary to Divine Justice, as that no Law or Scrip∣ture of God can command it, nor any right Reason of Man ap∣prove it. But examining this Text farther I find two things more observa∣ble. The one, that the Soldier here, whose Example is the ground of this Argument, is not bound under Pain of any Sin, not to busie himself with the Affairs of this Life; but he doth it not (saith the Text) to the end he may please him whose Soldier he is. So then, if any Man, the better to please God, forbears this Employment, and his Conscience and Love to his Calling be his Motives so to do, he does well. But if another Man, who hath no scruple in himself, and finds he can do both without an Entanglement by the one to the prejudice of the other, and thereupon be so employ'd (for ought I know) he doth not sin. The other is, perhaps this Lord may find that St. Paul here in this place instructs Timothy, not so much for the Work of the Ministery (as here he affirms) as for the general Work of Christianity. For, Ver. 1. he exhorts to Constancy and Perseve∣rance, that he be strong in the Grace which is in Jesus Christ. And then this Argument falls upon other Christians as well as upon Ministers, though not so much. And then I hope this Lord, who is so careful for our Spiritual Warfare, will take some care of his own also; if the great care which he takes at this present for the Militia of the Kingdom entangles him not. But his Lordship is now come to con∣clude this Point. I conclude; That which by the Commandment of our Saviour, by the Practice and Doctrine of the Apostles, and I may add by the Canons of ancient Councils grounded thereupon, is prohibited to Ministers of the Gospel, and shewed to be such a distraction unto them from their Calling and Function, as will bring a Woe upon them, and is not rea∣sonable for them to admit of; if they shall notwithstanding entangle themselves withal, and enter into, it will bring a Guilt upon their Souls, and hurt them in respect of their Consciences. His Lordship is now come (so he tells us) to conclude this Point; and in this Conclusion he artificially sums up, and briefly, all his Arguments. I shall as briefly touch at my Answers before given, and stay upon nothing, unless I find somewhat new. This done, I shall wait upon him (for that's his desire Clergy-Men should) to the next Point.
And truly, I find nothing new in the folding up this Conclusion, but that he says, he may add that Ministers are prohibited from meddling with Wordly Affairs, by the Canons of Antient Councils grounded upon the Apostles Doctrine. The Church is much behold∣ing to this Lord that he will vouchsafe to name her Antient Coun∣cils: He doth not use to commit this Fault often, and yet lest he should sin too much in this kind, he doth but tell you that he may add these, but he adds them not. It may be he doubts, that if he should name those Canons, some sufficient Answer might be given them, and yet the Truth remain firm, that it is not only lawful, but fit and expedient in some times and cases, for Bishops to in∣termeddle with, and give Counsel in Temporal Affairs; and though this Lord names none, yet I will produce and examine such Canons and Antient Councils as I find, and see what they say in this business. The first I meet withal is — But here I find my self met with and prevented too, by a Book entituled Episcopacy asserted, made Episcopacy as∣serted §. 49. by a Chaplain of mine, Mr. Jer. Taylor, who hath learnedly looked into and answered such Canons of Councils as are most quick upon Bishops or other Clergy-Men for meddling much in Temporal Af∣fairs. And therefore thither I refer the Reader, being not willing to trouble him with saying over another Man's Lesson; only I shall examine such Councils (if any I find) which my Chaplain hath not met with or omitted. And the last that I meet with is the Conc. Sardi∣cens. edit.  apud Bion. To. 1. par. 1. p. 431. Council of Sardis; which though the last, is as high up in the Church as about the Year 347. And there was a Canon to restrain Prelats from their frequent resorts to the Court: Yet there are many Cases left at large in which they are permitted to use their own Judgment and Freedom. So that Canon seems to bring along with it rather Counsel than Command. And howsoever they are well left to their Liberty (as I conceive it) because to frequent the Court, as over-loving the place, is one thing; and to go thither, though often, when good Cause calls for them (be that Cause Spiritual or Temporal) is far from an Offence. For if it be Spiritual, they must go; that's their Office and Duty directly: And I see no Reason why the Physitians should be forbid to visit the places of greatest Sickness. This I am sure of, Euseb. de Vi∣ta Constant. L. 1. c. 35. Constantine the Great commanded the personal attendance of Bishops and other Clergy-Men in his Court. And if it be Tempo∣ral; they may go: that's their Duty by Consequence, especially, if they be called. For as their exemplary Piety may move much, so do I not yet know any designs of State, which are made the worse by Religion; or any Counsels of Princes hurt by being communi∣cated with Bishops, in whom doth, or should reside the Care of Religion and Religious Conversation. But perchance I have known some Counsels miscarry for want of this. The next is the first Conc. Car∣thag. 1. Can.  Council at Carthage, and there the Prohibi∣tion runs thus, They which are of the Clergy, non accedant ad Actus seu Administrationem, vel Procurationem domorum; which forbids (as I conceive it) this only, that they should not be Stewards of the Houses, or Bailiffs of the Lands of great Persons. And this may be both in regard of the great trouble belonging to such Places, and the hazard of Scandal which might arise, in case there should happen
any failure in such great Accounts. And in the Cod. Can. Eccl. Affric. Can. 16. Code of the African Councils it is thus read, non sint Conductores & Procuratores, nec  & inhonesto negotio, victum quaerant: which I think is the truer Reading. And then this Council doth not fordid all meddling in in Secular Affairs, but such as by their dishonest gain draw Scandal upon the Church: And there is great Reason such should be forbid∣den them. A third I meet withal, and that is the Council of Episcopi, Presbyteri & Diaconi de locis suis Negotiandi causâ non diseedant, nec  Provin∣cias quaestuosas  sectentur. Sane ad Victum suum conquirendum, aut Filium, aut Libertum, aut Mer∣cenarium, aut Amicum, aut  mittant: & si voluerint negoti∣ari intra Provinciam, negotientur. Conc. Eliberit. Can. 18. Eliberis about the Year of our Lord 306. where the Canon seems to be very strict against Clergy-Men's going to Markets and Fairs negotiandi causa, to make profit by negotiation; but require them to send their Son, their Friend or their Servant to do such business for them. And yet this Prohibi∣tion as strict as it seems, is not absolute, nor bind∣ing, farther than that they shall not pursue those matters of Gain out of their own Provinces; but if they will and think fit, they might for all this Canon negotiate, either for their neces∣sary maintenance or improvement of their Fortunes, so that they wan∣dred not abroad out of their own Province where they serve. In the mean time when all these, or any other Councils are duly weighed, and their meaning right taken, this will be the result of all; that neither Bishop nor other Clergy-Man might or may, by the Canons of Holy Church, ambitiously seek, or voluntarily of himself assume any Secular Engagement. And as they might not ambitiously seek great Temporal Employments, so might they not undertake any low or base ones for sordid and covetous ends. Nor might they relinquish their own Charge to spend their Strength in the assistance of a foreign one. But though they might not seek or voluntarily assume Secular Employment, Aut negotijs  se im∣miscere  pupillorum si forte Leges imponant in excusabilem cu∣ram, aut Civitatis Episcopus Ec∣clesiasticarum rerum solicitudinem habere praecipiat, aut Orphanorum & Viduarum, eorum qui sine  defensione sunt, ae personarum quae maxime indigent Ecclesiastico ad∣jutorio, & propter timorem Domini causa deposcat. Conc. Chalced. Act. 15. Can. 3. yet they might do any lawful thing impos'd on them by their Superiours. And so might the Bishop (who had no Superiour in his Province) if the Prince required his Service; or that he thought it necessary for the present State of the Church in which he liv'd: Balsamon. in Concil. Chalcedon. c. 3. p. 327. For if he might transmit his Power to those of the inferiour Clergy, no doubt but he might deal himself in such Civil Affairs, as are agreeable to the dignity of his Place and Calling: and generally the Bishop, or any other Clergy-Man, may and might by the ancient Canons of the Church be employed in any Action of Piety, though that Action be attended with Secular care and trouble. And this is without any strain at all collected out of that great and famous Council of Chalcedon, one of the four first General Councils, approved of highly throughout all Christendom, and with great reverence acknowledged in the Laws of this King∣dom. And therefore after the Canon of that Council had laid it down in general terms, that neither Bishop, Clerk, nor Monk, should farm Grounds, or immescere se, mix himself as it were with such Temporal Affairs, it adds some exceptions of like Nature to those by me expres∣sed, especially the last of them. And some of these will expound
the Canon of any Council which I have yet seen, that speaks most against Clergy-Mens embarking themselves in Secular Business. And therefore though this Lord would not, yet I have laid before you whatsoever is come to my Knowledge out of the Antient Councils; where by this last cited and great Council, his Lordship may see, that Bishops should meddle with and order some Temporal Affairs, as Per∣sons in that kind fitter to be trusted than other Men of what Rank or Condition soever; and therefore excepts from its own general Canon the Cases of Orphans and Widows, and the Estates of such Persons as most need Ecclesiastical help, or where any Cause in the fear of God requires it. In which Cases the Widows and the Fatherless have had much cause to bless God, when they have been referred to the Con∣science, Trust and Care of Bishops. But this were in a manner to make them Masters of the Wards or Guardians to them, which I know this Lord will not like by any means. It would come too near his Office; and then he would cry out indeed, that this was a greater Distraction of them from their Function to which God had called them, than that of the attending poor Widows Tables was to the Apostles: And yet he sees what some Canons of Antient Councils have decreed in this Case. Besides, we cannot have a better or a clearer Evidence of the true meaning of the Antient Canons than from the Practice of the Antient Fathers of the Church, who were strict and consciencious Observers of the Canons, and yet (as is before proved) meddled in many, and some the greatest Givil Affairs, being employ∣ed as Ambassadors from great Emperors and Kings: And Balsam. in Conc. Carthag∣prima, Can. 16. p. 328, 329. Balsamon observes, that whensoever it shall please the Prince to call any Bishops to such Employments, they neither are to be restrained by the afore∣said Canons, nor censured by them. I conclude this Point then, that Bishops are not prohibited to med∣dle with Civil publick Affairs, either by Christ's command, or by the Apostle's either Doctrine or Practice (though all their Practice doth not give an absolute Rule for all future Obedience as their Doctrine doth) and I may add not by Canons of Antient Councils (rightly un∣derstood) nor are all of them such Distractions as will bring a Woe upon Bishops or other Clergy-Men, though they meddle with them: I rather believe some things will be in a woful Case if they meddle not. And in some Cases there's all the Reason in the World they should be not only permitted, but some of them commanded to meddle; to the end that in all Consultations, especially the greatest, in Parliament, and at Council Table, it might be their care to see that Re∣ligion were kept upright in all; and that nothing by Practice or other∣wise pass, cum detrimento Religionis & Ecclesiae, with detriment to Re∣ligion or the Church, always provided that they do not so entangle themselves in any of these Affairs, as shall much prejudice their Fun∣ction; and this done, I know no Guilt that this meddling can bring upon their Souls, or hurt their Consciences. But this Lord having (as he thinks) concluded the contrary, proceeds now to the next Point, and says, that In the next place this meddling in Temporal Affairs doth  them, and strike them in their Credits; so far from Truth is that Po∣sition
which they desire to possess the World withal, that unless they may have those outward Trappings, or worldly Pomp added to the Mi∣nistery, that Calling will grow into Contempt and be despised. Good God! How Pious this Lord is, and what a careful Friend over the Church! First, he takes care the Bishops Consciences may not be hurt, and now he is as jealous over their Credits. But I doubt he is jealous over them amiss: For he is of Opinion, that meddling in Civil Affairs strikes them in their Credit; and he thinks farther, that the Position with which they would possess the World in this case is far from Truth. Let's examine this Position then, what it is, and what it works. The Position is, (as this Lord reports it) That un∣less they may have these outward Trappings, or worldly Pomp added to the Ministery, their Calling will grow into Contempt. First, there was never any Age in any Kingdom Christian, in which the Bishops were ridden with so much Scorn and Contempt as they are at this day in England; and this makes this Lord, though he be a very ordinary Horseman for any good Service, please himself with Trappings. Se∣condly, for the worldly Pomp which he means and expresses, the Train of that hath been long since cut short enough in England; and he that will not look upon the Bishops with an evil Eye must needs ac∣knowledge it. Well, but what then doth this Position work? Why they may not have these Trappings, there will follow Contempt upon their Calling; so he makes the Bishops say. Is this Lord of that Opi∣nion too? No sure; for he says, The Truth is, these things cast Contempt upon them in the Eyes of Men. They gain them Cap and Courtesie, but they have cast them out of the Consciences of Men; and the Reason is this, every thing is esteem∣ed as it is eminent in its own proper Excellency; the Eye in seeing, not in hearing; the Ear in hearing, not in speaking. The one would be rather monstrous than comely, the other is ever acceptable, being proper. So is it with them: their proper Excellency is Spiritual, the denial of the World, with the Pomps, and Preferments, and Employments there∣of. This they should teach and practice. Well then, the question is, Whether the Honour of Bishops and their Employments in Temporal Affairs, as they are at this day mo∣derated, in the Church and State of England, bring Contempt upon them and their Calling, as this Lord says; or help to keep off Con∣tempt, as he says the Bishops would possess the World. First, I am clear of Opinion that Solomon was almost as wife as this Lord thinks himself, and yet he says plainly, Eccles. 9. 16. That though Wis∣dom in its self be far better than Folly, yet the poor Man's Wisdom is despised, and his Words not heard. And we see in daily Experience, that a poor Minister's Words are as much slighted in the Pulpit, as a poor Man's in the Gate. And therefore these things which this Lord calls Trappings, are many times very necessary to keep off that Contempt and Despight which the boisterous Multitude, when their Sins are re∣proved, are apt to cast upon them. And whatsoever this Lord thinks, tis a great Credit and Support to the rest of the Clergy, and being
well used, a great advantage to their Calling, that the Bishops and other Eminent Men of the Clergy should have moderate Plenty for Means, and enjoy Honour and external Reputation; and though it be well known that the Church consider'd in Abstract, in and by its self only, is not promoted nor advanced by such Employ∣ments, yet, as she is considered in her Peregrination and Warfare, she gains by them great both Strength and Encouragement. Secondly, That which this Lord adds, that those things gain the Bishops Cap and Courtesie, but have cast them out of the Consciences of Men. 'Tis well that these things gain them that. For the Age is grown so churlish to that Calling, that I believe they would have very little of either, were it not for these things; as will too soon ap∣pear now this last Act of Parliament hath taken away their Trappings. As for that which follows next, that these things have cast them out of the Consciences of Men, that's not so: For in other Kingdoms that are Christian, and some Reformed as well as other, they have more Employment in Civil Affairs than with us, and yet are in high esteem in the Consciences of Men. But the Truth is, Schisin and Se∣paration have so torn Men from Clergy and Church, from God and Christ and all, that they have not only cast Bishops, but Religion too out of their Consciences, and their Consciences are thrown after, God knows whither. Now for the Reason which this Lord gives, he is quite wide in that also. For every thing is not esteemed as it is eminent in its own pro∣per Excellency (as he says it is): Indeed it ought to be so, but so it is not. For in the place before cited, Eccles. 9. 16. Wisdom is better than Folly, and is most eminent in its own proper Excellency, but is it always esteemed so? No sure; for the poor Man's Wisdom is de∣spised. There, however it ought to be esteemed for its proper Ex∣cellency, yet if it be found in a poor Subject, 'tis despised and ac∣counted as mean and vile as he is that hath it. And as for the Illu∣stration which his Lordship makes of this his Proposition, 'tis meerly fallacious. For Arguments drawn from Natural Things, which ever work constantly the same way, to Moral Things, which depend upon voluntary and mutable Agents, will seldom or never universally fol∣low: And therefore though it be true, that the Eye is esteemed for seeing, not hearing; and the Ear for hearing, not speaking; and should it be otherwise it would be rather monstrous than comely. That's true, because they are Agents determined ad unum, to that one Ope∣ration, and cannot possibly do the other; but then, by his Lordship's leave, so it is not with Bishops; for though their proper Excellency be indeed Spiritual, yet they may meddle with other things so long as they can observe the Apostle's Rule, 1 Cor. 7. 31. and use this World as if they used it not; that is, use it so long and so far as may help their Service of God, and cast it off when it shall hinder them. But this Lord thinks all use of these things, and Employments in them, to be unlawful for our Calling. And therefore he adds, That when they, contrary hereunto, seek after a worldly Excellency, like the great Men of the World; and to Rule and Domineer as they do, contrary to our Saviour's Precept, Vos autem non sic, But it shall not
be so amongst you: Instead of Honour and Esteem, they have brought upon themselves, in the Hearts of the People, that Contempt and  which they now lie under; and that justly and necessarily, because the World sees that they prefer a worldly Excellency, and run after it, and contend for it, before their own; which being Spiritual is far more ex∣cellent, and which being proper to the Ministery, is that alone which will put a Value and Esteem upon them that are of that Calling. All this which follows is but matter of Ampliation, to help ag∣gravate the business, and to make Bishops so hateful to other Men, as they are to himself. For I hope no Bishops of this Church do seek after worldly Excellency contrary to their Function; at least I know none that do: And they are far from being like the Great Men of the World. As to Ruling, 'tis proper enough to them, so far as Au∣thority is given, but Domineer they do not. This comes from this Lord's Spleen, not from their Practice: And by that time his Lord∣ship hath sat a while longer in the State, Men will find other manner of Domineering from him, than they found from the Bishops. Nor do they in their meddling with Civil Affairs in such sort as is now practised in England, go contrary to our Saviour's Precept, Vos autem non sic, It shall not be so amongst you, as I have proved before. Most true indeed it is, that the poor Bishops of this Church do now instead of Honour and Esteem lie under Contempt and Odium in the Hearts of the People. Of some, not of all; no nor either of the greater or the better part, for all the noise that hath been raised against them; and this Lord is much deceived to say they have brought it upon themselves. For it is but part of the Dirt which this Lord and his fellow Sectaries have most unchristian-like cast upon them: And this only to wrest their Votes out of Parliament, that now they are gone, they may the better compass their ends against Church and State, which God preserve against their Malice and Hy∣pocrisie. But this Lord says farther, That the Bishops have brought this Contempt upon themselves justly and necessarily. Now God for∣bid that it should be either; and his Lordship proves it but by saying the same thing over again, namely, because the World sees that they prefer a worldly Excellency, and run after it, and contend for it before their own. And surely if they do this, they are much to blame; but I believe the World sees it not, unless it be such of the World as look upon them with this Lord's Eyes, and that when they are at the worst too. And I verily persuade my self and I think upon very good grounds, that the present Bishops of this King∣dom, all or the most of them, are as far from any just tax in this or any other kind, as they have been in any former Times since the Reformation. 'Tis true, that their own Calling being Spiritual, is far more excellent; and I shall the better believe it, when I see this Lord and the rest value it so. For I have told his Lordship already, that every thing which is more excellent in its self, is not always so estee∣med by others: And though this Excellency be never so proper, yet by his good leave, it is not that alone which will put a value and esteem upon them and their Calling. There must be some outward helps to encourage, and countenance, and reward them too, or else
Flesh and Blood are so dull, that little will be done. And suppose this Religious Lord, and some few like himself, would value and esteem them for their Spiritual Calling only, yet what are these to so many as would  them? And yet to speak the Truth freely, I do not see this Lord, nor any of that Feather, put a value upon that Calling for the Spiritual Excellency only; for then all Ministers that do their Duty should be valued and esteemed by them, the Calling being alike Spiritual and alike Excellent in all: whereas the World sees they neither care for nor countenance any Ministers, but such as separate with them from the Church of England, or are so near to it, as that they are ready to step into an Independent Congregation, so soon as by the Artifice of this Lord and others, it may be made ready to receive them. Now this Lord having thus belaboured these two Points, that Bishops by meddling in Civil Affairs do hurt them∣selves in their Consciences and in their Credits; he proceeds to in∣struct us farther. And thus, As these things hurt themselves in their Consciences and Credits, so have they, and if they be continued, still will make them hurtful to others. The Reason is, because they break out of their own Orb and move irregularly. There is a Carse upon their leaving their own Place. My Lord is now come to his second general part of his Speech, and means to prove it if he can, that Bishops by any kind of med∣dling in Civil Affairs do not only hurt themselves in Conscience and in Credit, but also, if they continue in them, they will make them hurtful to others also. And that he may seem to say nothing with∣out a Reason, his Lordship tells us the Reason of this is, because they break out of their own Orb and move irregularly. But I conceive this Reason weak enough. For first (as is before proved) these Stars (to follow my Lord in his Metaphor) are not so fixed to their Orb of Preaching the Gospel, but that they may do other things also at other times, so this be not neglected. And therefore it will not fol∣low that all their Motions out of this Orb are irregular. Secondly, when they do thus move, they are not violently to break out of their Orb, but to sit still till Authority find cause to call any of them a little aside, to attend Civil Affairs, that they may proceed never the worse, and the Gospel the better. As for that Curse which this Lord speaks of, which follows upon their leaving of their own Place; I know of none, nor any leaving of their own Place. This I am sure of, whatever this Lord says, that many extraordinary Blestings and Successes have come both upon this Kingdom and other Nations, by Counsels given by Clergy-Men; and I pray God his Counsels, such as they have been, do not bring Dishonour, and a Curse to boot, upon this Church and Kingdom. But his Lordship goes on with his Metaphor, and argues very strongly by Similitudes; which hath but a Similitude of Argumentation. The Heavenly Bodies while they keep within their own Spheres give Light and Comfort to the World, but if they should break out and  from their regular and proper Motions, they would set the World on
So have these done. While they kept themselves to the Work of the Mi∣nistery alone, and gave themselves to Prayer and the Ministery of the Word, according to the Example of the Apostles, the World received the greatest Benefits from them; they were the Light and Life thereof. But when their Ambition cast them down like Stars from  to Earth, and they did grow once to be advanced above their Brethren; I do appeal to all who have been versed in the antient Ecclesiastical Hi∣story, or modern Histories, whether they have not been the common In∣condiaries of the Christian World, never ceasing from Contention one with another about the Precedency of their Sees and Churches, Excom∣municating one another, drawing Princes to be Parties with them, and thereby casting them into bloody Wars. This Argument is grounded upon si  ruat, if Heaven falls we shall get store of Larks. But Heaven cannot sall, and so 'tis here. The Heavenly Bodies while they keep within their own Spheres, give Light and Comfort to the World; but if they should break out, which is impossible, and fall from their Regular Motions, which cannot possibly be, they would set the World on fire; or perhaps drown it again (had not God promised the contrary) according as the Irre∣gular Motion bended. So have these done. Nay, not so with this Lord's leave. For First, Clergy-Men are not so fixed to their Orbs as those Heavenly Bodies are, but in themselves are free and voluntary Agents, which those Bodies are not. And Secondly, they may and ought as occasion is offered them, do many things in publick Civil Affairs, which may much advantage the Gospel of Christ, and they will never Fire the World by such attendance upon them; and they may and ought give themselves to Prayer and to the Ministery of the Word notwithstanding this: and they may be the same Benefits to the World of Light and Life as before. Yea, and I make no doubt, but that when this Lord and his Followers will be as liberal and devout as the Primitive Christians were, who sold their Land and  the Money, and laid it at the Apostles Feet, Acts 4. 37. to make a Stock for their and the Church's Wants, the Bishops will be well content to follow the Apostles Example, as far and as well as they can. But if the Bishops may meddle with no Temporal Affairs, ac∣cording to the Example of the Apostles; how came the Apostles to meddle with the Receiving first, and after with the Layings out of all this Money? For, say it was to be employed on charitable Actions, yet some Diversion more or less it must needs be to the Preaching of the Gospel. But since the Example and Practice of the Apostles is so often pressed by this Lord, I would willingly his Lordship should tell me (if he will make their Practice a Rule general and binding) why now among Christians all should not be common, as the Apostles and other Believers had it; and that no Man might say that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, Acts 4. 32. and then where is the Property of the Subject? And then why do we not go up and down and Preach at large, according to the Examples of the Apostles, and endure neither Division of Parishes nor Parish Churches? And why do we not receive the Communion after Supper, at 'tis well known Christ and his Apostles. did? Indeed, if any Bishops or other Clergy-Men
should become falling Stars from Heaven to Earth; especially if their Sin should be so like the Devil's as to cast themselves down by their own Ambition: That, as it makes the Fall heavy to them, so yet I must say to this Lord, that both Fall and Fault is the Person's; the Episcopal Office is not the cause of it, as is here charged by him. Nor did they become falling Stars so soon as they did once grow to be advanced above their Brethren, as this Lord insinuates it. For a∣mong the Apostles themselves there was a Chief in order, S. Luke 22. 26. and some were advanced to Dignity and Power above their Brethren, even in the Apostles Days; whom yet, I presume, this Lord will not be so ill advised as to call fallen Stars. As for the Appeal which he makes to all them who have been ver∣sed in Antient or Modern Ecclesiastical Histories; that's no great mat∣ter. For in all Histories you shall find great Men of all sorts doing what in Honour and Duty should not be done; and Ambition hath been the cause of very much of this, and Ambition sticks so close to Humane Nature, as that it follows it into all Professions and Estates of Men: And I would to God Clergy-Men had been freer from this Fault than Histories testifie they have. But this hath been but the fault of some; many Reverend Bishops in all Ages have been clear of it, and 'tis a personal Corruption in whomsoever it is, and cannot justly be charged upon the Calling, as this Lord lays it. Neither have the worst of them (some Popes of Rome excepted) been the common Incendiaries of the Christian World. But Incendiaries is grown a great word of late with this Lord; and some of the poor Bishops of Eng∣land have been made Incendiaries too by him and his Party. But might it please God to shew some token upon us for good, that they which hate us may see it, and be ashamed, Psalm 86. 17. there would be a full discovery who have been the Incendiaries indeed in these Troubles of England; and then I make no question but it will appear that this Lord flames as high and as dangerously as any Man living. But be∣hold (saith God) all ye that kindle a Fire, that compass your selves about with Sparks; walk in the light of your own Fire, and in the Sparks which your selves have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand, ye shall lie down in Sorrow, Isai. 50. 11. Next I pray be pleased to consider, how unworthily, and fallaciously withal, this Lord manages this Proof. For all this Discourse tends to prove it unlawful for Bishops to intermeddle in Secular Affairs; that so to do is hurtful to themselves in Conscience and in Credit, and to others also by this their irregular Motion. And this he proves by their never ceasing from Contention one with another, either about the Precedency of their Sees or Churches. They have indeed some, and sometimes, contended too eagerly for their Sees and Churches; but neither all, nor any that I know with a never-ceasing, but the Bishop of Rome for his Supremacy. And say this were so, yet these Contentions were about their own proper Places, not about Civil Af∣fairs, which now should lie before his Lordship in Proof; and there∣fore was no irregular Motion of theirs in regard of the Object, but only in regard of the manner. Nor were they out of their Orb for this, though faulty enough. The like is to be said for that which follows, their Excommunicating one another upon these Quarrels. As
for their drawing of Princes to be Parties with them, thereby casting them into bloody Wars; this hath seldom happened, and when∣ever it hath happened, some Church business or other hath unhap∣pily set it on, not their meddling in Temporal Affairs. But whatever caused it, the Crime of such misleading of Princes is very odious, and as hateful to me as it can be to his Lordship. But the Persons must bear their own Faults, and not the Calling; and, sure I am, this Lord would think me very wild, if I should charge the antient Barons Wars in England, upon his Lordship and the Honourable Barons now living. But howsoever by this 'tis plain, that this Lord would not only have the Bishops turned out of all Civil Employments, but out of their Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions also: They must have no Power nor Superiority there neither; their Sees must be laid as level as Parity can make them. For all these Mischiefs came on (saith he) as soon as they were once advanced above their Brethren. And one thing more I shall take occasion to say. Here's great Cla∣mour made against the Bishops, and their meddling in Civil Affairs; but what if the Presbytery do as much or more? Do they Sin too by breaking out of their Orb, and neglecting the Work of the Ministery? No, by no means: Only the Bishops are faulty. For do you think that Calvin would have taken on him the Umpirage, and composing of so many Civil Causes as he did order between Neighbours, if so great Sin had accompanied it? For he dealt in Ci∣vil Causes, and had Power to Omnes in Carcerem conjecti sunt, &c. Calvin. Epist. ad Fa∣rellum. inflict Civil Punish∣ments in his Consistory. For he committed divers to Prison for Dancing, and those not mean ones nei∣ther; and he Calvin. Epist. ad Viretum, fol. 373. Edit. 1575. arbitrated divers Causes; and in a great Controversie between the Senate of Geneva, and a Gentleman, he tells one Frumentius who laboured for a Reconciliation, that the Church of Geneva was not so destitute, but that Calvin. Epist. ad Farellum, sol. 384. Fratres mei (saith he) huic Provinciae subeundae pares futuri essent, some of his Brethren might have been fit for that Work. Belike he took it ill, that in such a Business, though meerly Civil, he and his Fellow-Ministers should be left out. And for matters in the Common∣wealth he had so great Power in the Senate, and with the People, that all things were carried as he pleased. And him∣self brags of it, that the Senatum esse nostrum. Calvin. ad Farellum, fol. 72. Populum esse nostrum. Calvin. ad Viretum, fol. 73. Senate was his and the People his. And to encrease his Strength, and make it more formidable, he brought in Fifty or more of the French his Country-men and Friends, and by his solicitation made them Free Denizons of the City; Calvin. Epist. ad Viret. sol. 163. of which and the Troubles thence arising he gave an account to Bullinger, Anno 1555. Or can you think that Beza would have taken upon him so much Secular Employment, had he thought it unlawful so to do? For where∣as in the Form of the Civil Government of that City, out of the Two hundred prime Men there was a perpetual Senate chosen of Sixty, as Bodin, l. 2. de Repub. c. 6. Bodin tells us; my worthy Predecessour Survey of the pretended Holy Discipline, c. 26. Arch-Bishop Bancroft assures me, Beza was one of these Threescore. And yet what a cry∣ing Sin is it grown in a Bishop to be honoured with a Seat at the
Council-Table? Besides this; when Geneva sent a solemn Embassie to Henry IV. of France, about the razing of a Fort which was built near their City by the Duke of Savoy, Thuan. Hist. Anno 1600. c. 125. Beza would needs go along to com∣mend that Spiritual Cause unto the King; and how far he dealt, and laid Grounds for others to deal in all such Civil Causes, as were but in Ordine ad Spiritualia, is manifest by Beza de Ex∣commun. p. 47. himself. And I am sure Lae∣sus proximus may reach into the Cognizance of almost all Civil Cau∣ses. Or can any Man imagine that so Religious a Man as Mr. Dam∣port, the late Parson of St. Stephen's in Coleman-street, would have done the like to no small hindrance to Westminster-Hall, had he thought that by this meddling he had hurt both his Conscience and his Credit, whereas (good Man) he fled into New-England to preserve both. Or, if Mr. Alexander Henderson would have come along with the Scottish Army into England, and been a Commissioner (as he was) in that whole Treaty, wherein many of their Acts of Parliament con∣cerning the Civil Government of that Kingdom were deliberated up∣on and confirm'd; if he had thought his so doing inconsistent with his Calling? Or that the Scots (being so Religious as they then were, even to the taking up of Arms against their King for Religion) would have suffered him to take that place upon him, so contrary to the command of Christ, and the Practice of the Apostles, if it had been so indeed? Or, would they have suffer'd their Preachers, which then attended their Commissioners at London, not only to meddle with, but to preach so much temporal Stuff as little belonged to the Purity of the Gospel, had they been of this Lord's Opinion? Surely, I cannot think it. But let the Bishops do but half so much, yea, though they be commanded to do that which these Men assume to themselves; and 'tis a venture but it shall prove Treason against the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, and an endeavouring to bring in an Arbitrary Go∣vernment. Well! I'll tell you a Tale. There's a Minister at this day in London, of great Note among the Faction, well esteem'd by this Lord and others of this Outcry against the Bishops Votes in Parliament, and their meddling in Civil Affairs; this Man (I'll spare his Name) being pressed by a Friend of his, how he came to be so eager against the Church, of which and her Government he had ever heretofore been an Upholder, and had Subscribed unto it, made this Answer; Thou art a Fool; thou knowest not what it is to be the Head of a Party. This Man is one of the great Masters of the present Reformation; and do you not think it far more inconsistent with his Ministerial Function to be in the Head of a turbulent Faction (to say the least of them) than for a Bishop to meddle in Civil Affairs? Yet such is the Reli∣gion of our Times. But 'tis no matter for all this; his Lordship hath yet more to say against the Ambition of the Prelates. For, Their Ambition and intermeddling with Secular Affairs and State Business, hath been the cause of shedding more Christian Blood than any thing else in the Christian World; and this no Man can deny that is versed in History. This is the same over and over again; saving that the Expression contains in it a vast Untruth. For they that are versed in History must
needs say 'tis a loud one, that Bishops meddling in Temporal Affairs hath been the cause of shedding more Christian Blood, than any thing else in the Christian World. What a happiness hath this Lord that his pale Meagerness cannot blush at such thing as this. Yea, but he will prove it here at home in this Kingdom. For, says he, We need not go out of our own Kingdom for Examples of their Insolency and Cruelty. When they had a dependency upon the Pope, and any footing thereby out of the Land, there were never any that carryed themselves with so much Scorn and Insolency towards the Princes of this Kingdom, as they have done. Two of them the Bishop that last spake hath named, but instances of many more may be given, whereof there would be no end. 'Tis true indeed we need not go out of our own Kingdom for Examples of their Insolency and Cruelty. For in so many Ages 'tis no wonder in any Kingdom to find some bad Examples, be it of Insolency, Cruelty or what you will: Especially in the midst of so much Prosperity as accompanied Clergy-Men in those times. But 'tis true too, that there are far more Examples of their Piety and Charity, would this Lord be pleased to remember the one with the other. As for their bad Examples his Lordship gives a Reason why not all, but some of them, carryed themselves with so much Scorn and Insolency towards their Princes, even with almost as much as this Lord and his Faction carry themselves at this day towards their mild and gracious King. And the Reason is a true one; it was their dependency upon the Pope, and their footing which thereby they had to subsist out of the Land: which may, and I hope will be a sufficient warning to his Majesty and his Successours, never to let in again a foreign Supream Power into any of his Dominions. For 'tis to have one State within, yet not dependent upon the other, which can never be with Safety or Quiet in any Kingdom: And I would have the World consider a little with what Insolency, and perhaps Disallegiance this Lord and his Round-head Crew would use their Kings, if they had but half so strong a foreign dependance as the Bishops then had, that dare use the most gracious of Kings as they do this present day. Two of these Insolent ones (this Lord says) the Bishop that last spake named. Lincoln stands in the Margin, by which it appears that Dr. John Williams then Bishop of Lincoln, and since Arch-Bishop of York, was the Man that named two; but because this Lord names them not, I know not who they are, and therefore can say nothing for or against them, but leave them to that Lord which censured them. As for that which follows, that the instances of many more may be given, whereof there would be no end. This is a piece of this Lord's loud Rhetorick, which can have no Truth in it, especially relating, as it doth, to this Kingdom only. But whereas this Lord said immediately before, that their med∣dling in State business hath been the cause of shedding more Christian Blood, than any thing else in the Christian World, and in the very next words falls upon the proof of it in this Kingdom; I must put him in mind that one Parliament in England, namely, that which most
irreligiously and trayterously deposed Richard II. was the cause of the effusion of more Christian Blood amongst us, than all the Bishops that ever were in this Kingdom. For that base and unjust Parliament was the cause of all the Civil Wars, those Bloody Wars which began in the Heir's time after the Usurpation of Henry IV. and ceas∣ed not till there were slain of the Royal Blood and of Nobles and the common People a Numberless Number: And I heartily beg it of God, that no disloyal Parliament may ever bring this Kingdom into the like distress. For our Neighbours are far stronger now than they were then, and what desolation it might bring upon us, God in Heaven knows. So this Lord may see, if he will, what a Parlia∣ment it self being misgoverned may do. But will his Lordship think it Reason to condemn all Parliaments because this, and some few more, have done what they should not do, as he here deals by Bishops? Sure he would not. But having done with the Bishops dependency on the Pope, he goes on and tells us farther, that Although the Pope be cast off, yet now there is another Inconvenience, no less prejudicial to the Kingdom, by their sitting in this House; and that is, they have such an absolute dependency upon the King, that they sit not there as free Men. I am heartily sorry to see this Lord thus far transported: The Pope is indeed cast off from domineering over King, Church, and State. But I am sorry to hear it from this Lord, that this other Inconvenience by Bishops sitting in the House of Parliament, is no less prejudicial to the Kingdom. Where, first I observe that this Lord accounts the Pope's ruling in this Kingdom, but a matter of inconvenience; for so his words imply. For that must be one In∣convenience, if the Bishops voting be the other; and I am sure the Laws both of this Church and State, make it far worse than an Incovenience. Had I said thus much, I had been a Papist out of Question. Secondly; I'll appeal to any prudent and moderate Pro∣testant in the Christian World, whether he can possibly think that the Bishops having Votes in the Parliaments of England can possibly be as great, or no less an Inconvenience, than the Pope's Supremacy here. And I believe this Lord when he thinks better of it, will wish these words unsaid. Well! but what then is this inconvenience that is so great? Why, my Lord tells us, 'tis because they have such an absolute dependency upon the King that they sit not there as free-Men. Where first, 'tis strange to me and my Reason, that any dependency on the King, be it never so absolute, can be possibly so great an Inconvenience to the King, as (that upon) an Independent foreign Power is; the King being sworn to the Laws, but the Pope being free, and (as he challenges) not only independent from, but superiour to, both King and Laws. Secondly, I conceive the Bishops dependency is no more absolute upon the King than is the dependence of other Honourable Members of that House, and that the Bishops sit there as absolute free-men as any others, not excepting his Lordship. And of this Belief I must be till the contrary shall be proved; which his Lordship goes thus about to do.
That which is requisite to Freedom is, to be void of Hopes and Fears; he that can lay down these is a Free-man, and will be so in this House: But for the Bishops, as the case stands with them, it is not likely they will lay aside their Hopes; greater Bishopricks being still in expectancy; and for their Fears they cannot lay them down, since their Places and Seats in Parliament are not invested in them by Blood, and so hereditary; but by annexation of a Barony to their Office, and depending upon that Office; so that they may be  of their Office, and thereby of their Places at the King's pleasure. My Lord's Philosophy is good enough; for to be void of Hopes and Fears is very requisite to Freedom, and he that can lay these down, is a Free-man, or may be if he will: But whether he will be so in that great House, I cannot so well tell. For though no Man can be free that is full charg'd with Hopes or Fears; yet there are some other things which collaterally work upon Men, and consequently take off their Freedom, almost as much as Hopes and Fears can do. Such are Consanguinity, Affinity, especially if the Wife bears any sway; private Friendship, and above all Faction. And therefore though I cannot think that every Man will be a Free-man in that House, that is void of Hopes and Fears, yet I believe he may if he will. Now I conceive that in all these collateral Stiflings of a Man's Freedom, the Lay Lords are by far less free than the Bishops are. Again, for the main bars of Freedom, Hopes and Fears, into which all the rest do some way or other fall, I do not yet see but that Bishops, even as the case stands with them, may be as free, and I hope are, in their Voting as Temporal Lords. For their Hopes, this Lord tells us 'tis not likely they will lay them aside, greater Bishopricks being still in expectancy. Truly, I do not know why a deserving Bishop may not in due time hope for a better Bishoprick; and yet retain that Freedom which becomes him in Parliament, as well as any Noble-man may be Noble and Free in that great Court, and yet have moderated Hopes of being called to some great Office, or to the Council-table, or some honourable and profitable Embassage, or some Knighthood of the Garter; of all, or some of which, there is still expectancy. Lay your Hand on your Heart, my Lord, and examine your self. As for Fears, his Lordship tells us roundly the Bishops cannot lay them down. Cannot? Are all the Bishops such poor Spirits; But why can they not? Why, because their Places in Parliament are not hereditary, but by annexation of a Barony to their Office, and depending upon it; so that they may be deprived of their Office, and thereby of their Place at the King's pleasure. First; I believe the Bishops gave their Votes in Parliament as freely to their Con∣science and Judgment as this Lord or any other. Secondly; If any of them for Fear or any other motive have given their Votes un∣worthily; I doubt not but many Honourable Lords have at some time or other forgot themselves and born the Bishops company: though in this I commend neither. Thirdly; I know some Bishops who had rather lose not their Baronies only, but their Bishopricks also, than Vote so unworthily as this Lord would make the World
believe they have done. Lastly, it is true their Seat in Parliament depends on their Barony, their Barony on their Office; and if they be deprived of their Office, both Barony and Seat in Parliament are gone. But I hope my Lord will not say we live under a Tyrant; and then I will say Bishops are not deprivable of their Office, and consequently not of the rest, at the Kings Pleasure. But this Lord proceeds into a farther Amplification: And to whet his inveterate Malice against the King, says as follows. Nay, They do not so much as sit here, dum bene se gesserint, as the Judges now by your Lordships Petition to the King have their Places granted them, but at Will and Pleasure; and therefore as they were all excluded by Edward the First, as long as he pleased, and Laws made excluso Clero, so may they be by any King at his Pleasure in like man∣ner. They must needs therefore be in an absolute dependency upon the Crown, and thereby at Devotion for their Votes, which how prejudicial it hath been, and will be to this House, I need not say. If I could wonder at any thing which this Lord doth or says in such Arguments as these, when his Heart is up against the Clergy, I should wonder at this. For if he will not suppose the King's Govern∣ment to be Tyrannical, the Bishops have their Places during Life, and cannot justly be put out of them, unless their Miscarriage be such as shall merit a Deprivation. And therefore, by this Lord's good leave, they have as good a Tenure as the Judges is of a Quamdiu bene se gesserint. And this they have without their Lordships Petition to the King, as his Lordship tells us was fain to be made for the Judges, there∣by galling the King for giving some Patents to the Judges during Plea∣sure; which, as the Case stood with them, whether he had Reason to do or not, I will not dispute. So that manifest it is, that the Bishops do not hold their Bishopricks at the King's Will and Pleasure, and consequently neither their Baronies nor their Places in Parlia∣ment. And I would have my Lord consider, whether all the Noblemen that sit in that House, by Blood and Inheritance, be not in the same Condition upon the matter with the Bishops. For as Bishops may commit Crimes worthy Deprivation, and so consequently lose their Votes in Parliament; so are there some Crimes also which Noblemen may commit (God preserve them from them) which may consequent∣ly void all their Rights in Parliament, yea, and taint their Blood too. And as for the Bishops Baronies, they are not at the King's Will and Pleasure neither: For they hold their Baronies from the Crown indeed, but by so long Prescription as will preserve them from any Disseisure at Will and Pleasure of the King. So if they merit not Deprivation by Law and Justice, their Baronies are safe, and that by as good Right, and far antienter Descent, than any the antientest No∣bleman of England can plead for himself. For Edward the First, he was a brave Prince, and is of glorious Memory, and respected the Dutifulness of his Clergy very Royally. As for the Acts of Parliament made in his Time, and the Time of his Royal Successor Edward the Third, I conceive nothing can be gather∣ed
out of the Titles or Prefaces of those Acts, against either the Bi∣shops presence at, or their Voting to those Laws, by any Prohibition of Exclusion of them, by those famous Kings. For though the Sta∣tute of Carlisle, 35 Edw. I. not Printed, be recited in the Statute Et Similiter in the Statute of 27 Ed. 3. and 38 Ed. 3. both of Provisces. 25 Edw. III. of Provisoes, and says, that by the Assent of the Earls, Barons, and other Nobles, and all the Commonalty, at their Instances and Requests in the said full Parliament, it was ordained. &c. with∣out any mention at all of the Prelates; yet it is more than probable, that the Prelates were Summoned to, and present at these Parliaments. For first, it appears expresly that the Statute of the Staple, 27 Edw. III. made in the same Parliament with the Statute of Provisoes, that the Prelates were Assembled and Present there: And I rather think that in all these Statutes of Provisoes (being professedly made against the Liberty and Jurisdiction of the Pope, in those Times challenged in this Kingdom, to whose Power the Bishops were then Subject) they voluntarily chose to be absent, rather than endanger themselves to the Pope, if they Voted for such Laws; or offend the King and the State, if they Voted against them. But these Laws were not made excluso Clero, and that as long as the King pleased (as this Lord affirms) and this is very plain in the Statute it self of 38 Edw. III. For in the last Chapter of that Statute, though the Prelates be omitted in the Pre∣amble, yet there 'tis expresly said, That the King, the Prelates, the Dukes, Earls and Barons, &c. So here was not exclusion of the Bi∣shops by the King, but their own voluntary Absence, which made those kind of Laws pass without them. As for the Parliament at Carlisle, I conceive the Books are misprint∣ed, and a common Errour risen by it. For that Parliament was held Anno 35 Edw. I. and was the first of Provisoes; and as appears in the Records, the Prelates were present. Rotulo . 25 Ed. 1. M. 6. . But in 25 Edw. I. the Parlia∣ment was Summoned to London, and the Bishops called to it. And there was M. 25 Dorso. another Summons to Salisbury in the same Roll, to which the Prelates were not called. But this, I conceive, was a Summons of the King's Great Council only, and not of a Parliament, the Com∣mons not being called any more than the Prelates: Nor were there any other Summons, 25 Edw. I. but these two. That which his Lordship infers upon this, is, that therefore the Bishops are in abso∣lute dependency upon the Crown; which is manifestly untrue, since they cannot be outed at Will and Pleasure, but for Demerit only; and that may fall upon Temporal Lords as well as Bishops. And therefore neither are they at Devotion for their Votes; and there∣fore, in true Construction, no Prejudice can come by them to that Honourable House. And I pray God their casting out be not more prejudicial both to State and Church than I am willing to forespeak. After this his Lordship tells us what he hath done in this great Argu∣ment, saying, I have now shewed your Lordships how hurtful to themselves and o∣thers these things, which the Bill would take away, have been. I will only Answer some Objections which I have met withal, and then crave your Pardon for troubling you so long.
His Lordship tells us he hath shewed how hurtful these things are both to the Bishops and others, which this Bill would hew down; and out of his Zeal and Love to the Church he hath gone farther than any Man in this Argument; yet I conceive he hath not shewed what he thinks he hath. 'Tis true, he hath strongly laboured it, but I hope it will appear he hath not master'd it. I shall now see how he Answers such Objections, as his Lordship says he hath met with. And the First Objection is, his Lordship says, 1. That they have been very Antient. 2. That they are Established by Law. 3. That it may be an Infringement to the House of Peers, for the House of Commons to send up a Bill to take away some of their Members. To these three the Answer will be easie. I know not how easie the Answer will be, but these must needs be hard Times for Bishops, if neither Antiquity can fence them against Novelty, nor Law defend them against Violence, nor fear of weak∣ning the House of Peers preserve them against the Eagerness of the House of Commons; and that in the very House of Peers it self. Let us see then and consider how easie the Answer will be to these, and how sufficient also. To the First. Antiquity is no good Plea; for that which is by Ex∣perience found hurtful, the longer it hath done hurt, the more cause there is now to remove it, that it may do no more. Besides, other Irregula∣rities are as antient which have been thought fit to be redressed; and this is not so antient, but that it may truly be said, Non fuit sic ab initio. This Answer may be easie enough; but sure 'tis not sufficient: Nor do I wonder that Antiquity is no good Plea in this Lord's account; for he is such an Enemy to it, that he will have his very Religion new. If any thing be antient it smells of Antichrist. Yea, but if it be found hurtful, the longer it hath done hurt, the more cause to remove it. That's true; if it be hurtful in and of it self; so is not this. If it does hurt constantly or frequently; else you must cast out the Lay Lords Votes too, and his Lordship's with the rest. For out of all doubt their Votes do hurt sometimes, and it may be more often and more dange∣rously than the Bishops Votes: And when this Lord shall be pleased to tell us what those other Irregularities are, which are as antient and yet redressed, I will consider of them, and then either grant or deny. In the mean time, I think it hath been proved that it is no Irregularity for a Bishop that is called to it by Supreme Authority, to give Coun∣sel, or otherwise to meddle in Civil Affairs, so as it take him not quite off from his Calling. And for his Lordship's Close, That this is not so antient, but that it may be truly said, Non fuit sic ab initio; his Lordship is much deceived. For that Speech of our Saviour's, St. Matthew 19. 8. is spoken of Marriage which was instituted in Pa∣radise, and therefore ab initio, from the beginning, must there be taken from the Creation, or from the Institution of Marriage soon after
it. But I hope his Lordship means it not so here, to put it off that Bishops had not Votes in the Parliaments of England from the Creati∣on: For then no question but it may be truly said, Non fuit sic ab initio. But if his Lordship, or any other, will apply this Speech to any thing else, which hath not its beginning so high, he must then refer his Words and meaning to that time, in which that thing he speaks of took its beginning; as is this particular to the beginning of Parlia∣ments in this Kingdom. And then, under Favour of this Lord, the voting of Bishops in Parliament is so antient that it cannot be truly said, Non fuit sic ab initio: For so far as this Kingdom hath any Re∣cords to shew, Clergy-Men both Bishops and Abbots, had free and full Votes in Parliament; so full, as that in the first Parliament of which we have any certain Records, which was in the Forty and ninth Year of Henry the Third, there was Summoned by the King to Vote in Parliament, One hundred and twenty Bishops, Abbots and Priors, and but Twenty three Lay-Lords. Now there were but Twenty six Bi∣shops in all, and the Lords being multiplied (to the unspeakable Pre∣judice of the Crown) into above One hundred, besides many of their young Sons called by Writ in their Father's Life-time, have ei∣ther found or made a troubled time, to cast the Bishops and their Votes out of the House. 2. To the Objection for being Established by Law, his Lordship says, The Law-makers have the same Power and the same Charge to alter old Laws inconvenient, as to make new that are necessary. The Law-makers have indeed the same Power in them, and the same Charge upon them, that their Predecessors in former Times had; and there's no question but old Laws may be Abrogated and new ones made: But this Lord, who seems to be well versed in the Rules and Laws of Government (which the poor Bishops understand not) can∣not but know that it's a dangerous thing to be often changing of the Laws; especially such as have been antient, and where the old is not inconvenient, nor the new necessary; which is the true State of this Business, whatever this Lord thinks. 3. And for the Third Objection, the Privileges of the House, this Lord says, it can be no Breach of them. For either Estate may propose to the other by way of Bill, what they conceive to be for publick Good, and they have Power respectively of accepting or refusing. This is an easie Answer indeed, and very true. For either Estate in Parliament may propose to the other by way of Bill, and they have Power respectively of accepting or refusing; and there is no Breach of Privilege in all this. But this easie Answer comes not home. For how my Lord understands this Objection, I know not; it seems as if it did reach only to the external Breach of some Privilege, but I con∣ceive they which made the Objection meant much more. As name∣ly, that by this Bill there was an aim in the Commons to weaken the Lords House, and by making their Votes fewer, to be the better able to work them to their own Ends in future Businesses. So the Argu∣ment
is of equal, if not greater strength against the Lord's yielding to the Bill to the Iufringement of their own strength, than to the Commons proposing it, and there is no doubt but that the Commons might propose their Bill without Breach of Privilege; but whether the Lords might grant it without impairing their own strength, I leave the future Times, which shall see the Success of this Act of Parlia∣ment, to judge of the Wisdom of it, which I shall not presume to do. I thought his Lordship had now done, but he tells us, 4. There are two other Objections which may seem to have more force; but they will receive satisfactory Answers. The one is, that if they may remove Bishops, they may as well next time remove Barons and Earls. This Lord confesses the two Arguments following are of more force, but he says they will receive satisfactory Answers. And it may be so. But what Answers soever they may receive, yet I doubt whether those which that Lord gives be such: For to this of taking away of Barons and Earls next, his Lordship Answers two things. First he says, The Reason is not the same; the one sitting by an Honour invested in their Blood and Hereditary, which though it be in the King alone to grant, yet being once granted he cannot take away. The other sitting by a Barony depending upon an Office, which may be taken away; for if they be deprived of their Office, they sit not. To this there have been enough said before, yet that it may fully appear this Reason is not Satisfactory, this Lord should do well to know, or rather to remember, for I think he knows it already, that though these great Lords have and hold their Places in Parliament by Blood and Inheritance, and the Bishops by Baronies depending upon their Office; yet the King, which gives alone, can no more justly or lawfully alone away their Office without their Demerit, and that in a legal way, than he can take away Noblemens Honours. And there∣fore, for ought is yet said, their Cases are not so much alike as his Lordship would have them seem. In this indeed they differ somewhat, that Bishops may be deprived upon more Crimes, than those are for which Earls and Barons may lose their Honours; but neither of them can be justly done by the King's Will and Pleasure only. But Se∣condly, for farther Answer this Lord tells us, The Bishops sitting there is not so essential. For Laws have been, and may be made, they being all excluded; but it can never be shewed that ever there were Laws made by the King and them, the Lords and Earls excluded. This Reason is as little satisfactory to me as the former. For cer∣tainly, according to Law and Prescription of Hundreds of Years, the Bishops sitting in that House is as essential as the Lords. And this about the Laws made without them, is built only upon some difficult emergent Cases, from which they desired to be exempt and free themselves: Not from any constraint of the State; nor from any
Opinion of the King, Peers or People, that it was fit to make Laws without them. But to this we have given an Answer before. But this Objection of taking away the Earls and Barons next, strikes (as I conceive) another way at the Lord's House, than either of those Answers or Reasons seem to meet with. And perhaps this Lord him∣self is willing to pass it by, if he does see it; and 'tis thus. The House of Commons sees and knows well enough, that should they bring up a Bill open, and with a bare edge to take away the Votes from the Lords, it could not possibly be endured by either King or Peers. Therefore the Bill which may come to take them away next, and which may be meant in this Objection, may be a Bill to make one House of both, and set them altogether, under the pretence of grea∣ter Unity, and more free and quick dispatch of all Business, all Mes∣sages and Conferences, and breach of Correspondencies, and Diffe∣rences happening between the Two Houses, while they are Two, being by this means taken away. And this I am sure hath been much spoken of since this Parliament began, and may with far more ease be next compassed now the Bishops are thrust out; both because there are fewer in the Lord's House to help to cast out such a Bill, and because the Commons House, which would willingly receive the Lords in among them, would never admit the Bishops into their House. So that both ways this is made far more easie to Pass. And, should this happen, I would fain know of this Lord, wherein this Objection would fail, that they might the next time remove the Barons and the Earls. Not remove them from making Laws (as his Lordship speaks of it) but remove them into the House of Commons, where their Votes shall be swallow'd up among the many, and might be quite over∣master'd, though they should not all Agree and Vote one way. For then the meanest Commoner in that House would have his Vote as great as the greatest Earls. Whereas now in their own House being distinct, though all the House of Commons agree upon a Bill, or any thing else; the Lords may, if they see Reason, alter or reject it. So that if hereafter they be reduced to one House, I make no question but their Votes are gone next after the Bishops. And if his Lordship shall think this an impossible Supposition; let him know, it is not half so impossible, as that which he made before, of the Heavenly Bodies breaking out of their own Spheres. But we are now come to the last Objection, the other of the two, which his Lordship says are stronger. And, 5. The other Objection is this, That this Bill alters the Foundation of this House; and Innovations, which shake Foundations, are dan∣gerous. And truly this Objection seems to me very strong; but perhaps that is by reason of my Weakness; for my Lord tells us before, that it is capable of a satisfactory Answer; and here his Lordship gives two for failing. I Answer, First, That if there should be an Errour in the Founda∣tion, when it shall be found, and the Master-Builders be met together,
they may, nay, they ought rather to amend it, than to suffer it to run on still to the prejudice and danger of the whole Structure. This Answer, whatever this Lord thinks of it, is not satisfactory; and the thing will be full of danger, whensoever it shall be put to trial. For Foundations are seldom meddled withal but with great hazard, and a Fundamental Errour in a Kingdom is born with more Safety to the whole than it can be taken away. And this happens partly because among the many Subjects of a Kingdom there are different Judgments, and as different Affections; whence it follows, that all Men are not of Opinion, that that which is called an Er∣rour in the Foundation, is so indeed: Nor do the Affections of all Men dislike it, nay perhaps the greater, perhaps the better part will approve it. In this Case, if the Master-Builders fall to mend∣ing of this somewhat boisterously, may they not rend all in pieces, to fall about their own Ears, and other Mens? And partly, because the Master-Builders which are to meet to repair the decays of the State, though in all Ages they have the same Authority to make Laws, yet they have not in all Ages the same Skill and Wisdom, for the making or the mending of them. Whence it follows, that even the Master-Builders themselves may mistake, and call that the Errour, which is indeed a great part of the Strength of the Foun∣dation: And so by tampering to mend that which is better already, endanger the shaking, if not the fall, of the whole Structure, which they would labour to preserve. And I pray God Posterity do not find it, that even the Master-Builders which are now met, be not so deceived, and with as ill Success, in casting the Bishops Votes out of the House, under the Name of an Errour in the Foundation. But if this Answer satisfie not, his Lordship may hope his next will. For, Secondly; he says This is not Fundamental to this House. For it hath stood without them, and done all that appertains to the Power thereof without them, yea, they being wholly : and that which hath been done for a time at the King's pleasure, may be done with as little danger for a longer time; and when it appears to the fit, and for publick good, not only mahy, but ought to be done altogether by the Supreme Power. It seems this Lord distrusts his former Answer about mending Fun damental Errours in a State, and therefore here he denies that Bi∣shops and their Votes are Fundamental to the Lords House. But I doubt his Lordship is mistaken in this. For that is Fundamental in any Court, which in that Court is first laid and settled, upon which all the future Structure is raised. Now in the Lords House of Parliament, the Bishops Votes were laid at the very first, as well as the Votes of the Lords Temporal. Nay, with a Precedency both in Place and Number, and all the Ordinances and Powers of that great Court have equally proceeded from the Votes of the Bishops and the Lords: and therefore for ought which yet appears to me, either the Lords Vote are not Fundamental to that House, or the Bishops are.
But his Lordship proves they are not Fundamental to that House, because that House hath stood without them. But weakly enough, God knows, like a House whose Foundations are shaken upon one side, and because that House hath done all that appertains to the Power of it without them. It may be so. But I doubt whether it did all that ap∣pertains to the Wisdom of it without them. For this relation again to that Parliament under Edward the First, from which, his Lordship says Bishops were excluded; and we know that Parliament is called In∣doctum Parliamentum, the unlearned Parliament: For all the Lawyers were excluded from that Parliament as well as the Clergy-Men. And therefore were this Lord indifferent, he might argue that Lawyers Votes are not Fundamental in the Commons House; which is true, tho' no way convenient, rather than that Bishops Votes are not Fundamen∣tal in the Lords House; which is utterly against all Truth and Con∣venience. But his Lordship's Tooth is so sharp, and so black against that Order, that he snaps at them upon all, and upon no Occasion, and would invenom them had he Power. To make this seem the better, his Lordship ends this Speech with a piece of Philosophy, which I cannot approve neither. For he says, That which hath been done for a time at the King's Pleasure, may be done with as little danger for a longer time. For First, this Propo∣sition is unsound in it self: For many Cases may happen, in which divers things may be done for a Prince's Pleasure once, or for a time, and with no great danger; which continued or often repeated, will be full of danger, and perhaps not endured by the Subject. Secondly, I am confident, let the Tables be but turned from a Bishop to a Lay-Man, and this Lord shall eat his own Proposition. For in∣stance; in another Parliament, and in a time generally received to be as good as that of Edward the First, in Queen Elizabeth's time, and within my own Memory, Mr. Peter Wentworth moved in the House of Commons to have an Heir apparent declared for the better and securer Peace of the Kingdom in After-times. The Queen, for her meer Will and Pleasure (for that which he did was no Offence against Law) took him either out of the House, or so soon as he came out of the House, clap'd him up in the Tower, where he lay till his Death. What will this Lord say to this? Will he say this was done once at the Prince's Pleasure? Why then I return his Proposition upon him, and tell him, that that which was done once at one Prince's Pleasure, may be done oftner at other Prince's Pleasure with as little danger. Or will this Lord say this was not done at the Queen's Pleasure, but but she might justly and legally do so? Then other Princes of this Realm having the same Power residing in them, may do by other Parliament Men, as she did with this Gentleman. And which soever of the two he shall say, King Charles had as good Right, and with as little Breach of Parliament-Privilege, to demand the Six Men which by his Attorney he had accused of Treason, as that great Queen had to lay hold on Mr. Wentworth. Since I had written this, the Observer steps in and tells us, That a Observations upon some of His Majesty's late Answers, p. 7. meer Example (though of Queen Elizabeth) is no Law; for some of her Actions were retracted: and that yet without question Queen Eli∣zabeth might do that which a Prince less beloved could never have
done. 'Tis true, that a meer Example is not a Law, and yet the Par∣liaments of England, even in that happy Queen's Time, were not apt to bear Examples against Law; and if that she did were not against Law, that's as much as I ask. For then neither is that against Law which King Charles did upon a far higher Accusation, than could be charged against Mr. Wentworth. 'Tis true again, that Queen Eliza∣beth might do that which a Prince less beloved could not have done; that is, she might do that with safety, which a Prince less beloved could not do, that is, not do with safety. But whatsoever is lawful for one Prince to do, is as lawful for another; though perhaps not so expedient, in regard of what will be well or ill taken by the People. But otherwise the Peoples Affection to the Prince can be no Rule nor Measure of the Princes Justice to the People. I will be bold to give him another Instance. King Charles demand∣ed Ship-Money all over the Kingdom: Either he did this justly and legally for the Defence of himself and the Publick; or he did it at his Will and Pleasure, thinking that an honourable and fit way of De∣fence. I am sure this Lord will not say he did it legally, for his Vote concurred to the condemning of it in Parliament: And if he say he did it at his own Will and Pleasure, then I would fain know of his Lordship, whether this which was done for a time at the King's Plea∣sure, may be done with as little danger to the Liberty of the Subject, and the Property of his Goods, for a longer time, and so be conti∣nued on the Subject? And if he says it may, why did he Vote against it as a thing dangerous? And if he says it may not, then he must Condemn his own Proposition. For he cannot but see, that that which is once done, or done for a short time at a Prince's Will and Pleasure, cannot be often repeated or continued, but with far greater danger than it was once done. Though for the thing it self, if it were not legal, I am sorry it is not made so. For it would be, under God, the greatest Honour and Security that this Nation ever had: Whereas now the Tugging which falls out between the King's Power, and the Peoples Liberty, will in time (unless God's infinite Mercy prevents it) do that in this Kingdom, which I abhor to think on. This Lord goes on yet and tells us, That that which hath been so done for a time, when it appears to be fit and for publick Good, not only may, but ought to be done altogether by the Supream Power. So then here this is his Lordship's Doctrine, that that which was once done at a Prince's Will and Pleasure, when it shall appear to be fit, and for the publick Good (as he supposeth here the taking away of Bishops Votes to be) it not only may, but ought to be done altogether by the Supream Power, as now that is done by Act of Parliament. Not only may, but ought! Soft a little; His Lordship had the same Phrase immediately before. Why but, First, every thing that is fit, ought not by and by to be made up into a Law: For fitness may vary very often, which Laws should not. Secondly, Every thing that is for the publick Good, is not by and by to be made up into a Law. For many things in Times of Difficulty and Exigency may be for publick Good, which in some other Times may be hurtful, and there∣fore not to be generally bound within a Law. And if his Lordship shall say, as here he doth, that they ought to be done altogether, and
be made up into a Law by the Supream Power, but fitted only to such Times; under his Lordship's Favour, that ought not to be neither. For let such a Law be made, and he that is once Master of the Times, will have the Law ready to serve his turn and theirs, whether the Times bear the like Necessity or not. And since every thing that is fit, and is for publick Good, ought not by and by, without more Experience of it, to be made up into a Law; then much less that which appears so; yea, though it appear never so evidently; yea, and to the wisest Parliament that ever sat. 'Tis true, they may make such a thing into a Law, and 'tis fit for the most part so to do; but to say they ought to do it, is more than I can believe. For no Parliament is or can be so wise as to be infal∣lible, and no Evidence can be so apparent unto them in those things of infinite variety for the publick Good, and in which is so much uncertainty; but that they may both piously and prudently forbear the making of some of them into a Law if they please. But no Man may forbear that which he ought to do, when he ought to do it: And till that time comes, he ought not. This Lord hath now done, and so have I: And I shall end with my Prayers to God, that this Act of Parliament now made to cast the Bishops and their Votes out of the Parliament, how fit soever it seems, and how much soever it appears to this Lord to be for the publick Good, do not turn to the decay of Religion, and the great Damage and Detriment of King and Peers, of Church and State. Amen.
A SPEECH Delivered in the STAR-CHAMBER, On Wednesday the Fourteenth of June, 1637. AT THE CENSURE OF J. Bastwick, H. Burton, and W. Prinn; CONCERNING Pretended Innovations IN THE CHURCH.By the Most Reverend Father in GOD, WILLIAM LAUD, Then Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterbury.
TO HIS MOST Sacred Majesty, CHARLES, By the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &c. Most Gracious and Dread Sovereign, I Had no purpose to come in Print, but Your Majesty com∣mands it, and I obey. Most sorry I am for the Occasion that induced me to speak, and that since hath moved You to command me to Print. Nor am I ignorant that many things, while they are spoken and pass by the Ear but once, give great Content; which when they come to the Eyes of Men, and their often Scanning, may lie open to some Exceptions. This may fall to my Lot in this particular, and very easily, considering my many Diversions, and the little time I could snatch from other Imployment to attend this. Yet chuse I rather to obey Your Majesty, than to Sacrifice to mine own Privacy and Content. Since then this Speech uttered in publick in the Star-Cham∣ber, must now come to be more publick in Print; I humbly desire Your Sacred Majesty to Protect me, and it, from the undeserved Calumny of those Men, whose Mouths are spears and arrows, and their Tongues a sharp sword, Psal. 57. 4. Though as the wise Man speaks, their foolish Mouths have already called for their own stripes, and their Lips (and Pens) been a snare for their Souls, Prov. 18. 6, 7. The Occasion which led me to this Speech is known. There have of late been divers Libels spread against the Prelates of this Church. And they have not been more bitter, which is the Shame of these raging Waves, than they are utterly . 13. false, which is Our Happiness. But I must humbly beseech Your Majesty to consider, That 'tis not We only, that is, the
Bishops, that are struck at, but, through our sides, Your Ma∣jesty, Your Honour, Your Safety, Your Religion, is im∣peached. For what Safety can You expect, if You loose the Hearts of Your People? And how can You retain their Hearts, if You change their Religion into Superstition? And what Honour can You hope for, either present, or derivative to Po∣sterity, if You attend Your Government no better than to suffer Your Prelates to put this Change upon You? And what Ma∣jesty can any Prince retain, if he lose his Honour and his People? God be thanked 'tis in all Points otherwise with You: For God hath blessed You with a Religious Heart, and not subject to Change. And he hath filled You with Honour in the Eyes of Your People: And by their Love and Dutifulness He hath made You safe. So that Your Majesty is upheld, and Your Crown flourishing in the Eyes of Christendom. And God forbid any Libellous Blast at Home from the Tongues or Pens of a few, should shrivel up any growth of these. We have received, and daily do receive from God, many and great Blessings by You: And I hope they are not many that are unthankful to You, or to God for You. And that there should be none in a Populous Nation, even Enemies to their own Happiness, cannot be expected. Yet I shall desire even these to call themselves to an Account, and to remember, that Blasphemy against God, and slandering the Footsteps of his Anointed, are joined together, Psal. 89. For Psal. 89. v. 50. Wherewith thine Enemies hath Blasphemed Thee, and slandered the Footsteps of thine A∣nointed. he that Blasphemes God, will never stick at the Slander of his Prince; and he that gives himself the liberty to Slander his Prince, will quickly ascend to the next Highest, and Blaspheme God. But then, as I desire them to remember, so I do most hum∣bly beseech Your Majesty to account with Your self too: And not to measure Your Peoples Love by the Vnworthiness of those few. For a Loyal and Obedient People You have, and such as will spare nor Livelihood, nor Life, to do You Service; and are joyed at the Heart to see the Moderation of Your Go∣vernment, and Your Constancy to maintain Religion, and Your Piety in Exampling it. And as I thus beseech You for Your People in General, so do I particularly for the Three Professions which have a little suffer'd in these Three most Notorious Libellers Persons.
And first for my own Profession, I humbly beg of Your Majesty to think Mr. Burton hath not in this many Followers, and am heartily sorry he would needs lead. The best is, Your Majesty knows what made his Rancour swell; I'll say no more. And for the Law, I truly Honour it with my Heart, and believe Mr. Prynn may seek all the Inns of Court, (and with a Candle too if he will) and scarce find such a Malevolent as himself against State and Church. And because he hath so frequently thrust mistaken Law into these Pamphlets, to wrong the Governors of the Church, and abuse your good and well∣minded People, and makes Burton and Bastwick utter Law which, God knows, they understand not, (for I doubt his Pen is in all the Pamphlets) I do humbly, in the Church's Name desire of Your Majesty, that it may be resolved by all the Reverend Judges of England, and then published by Your Majesty, That our keeping Courts, and issuing Process in our own Names, and the like Exceptions formerly taken, and now renewed, are not against the Laws of the Realm, (as 'tis most certain they are not) that so the Church-Govern∣nors may go on chearfully in their Duty, and the Peoples Minds be quieted by this Assurance, that neither the Law, nor their Liberty, as Subjects, is thereby infringed. And for Physick, the Profession is honourable, and safe; and I know the Professors of it will remember that, Corpus Humanum, Man's Body, is that, about which their Art is con∣versant, not Corpus Ecclesiasticum, or Politicum, the Body of the Church, State, or Commonwealth. Bastwick only hath been bold that way. But the Proverb in the Gospel, in the St. Luke 4. 23. Fourth of St. Luke is all I'll say to him, Medice, cura teip∣sum, Physician, heal thy self. And yet let me tell Your Ma∣jesty, I believe he hath gained more by making the Church a Patient, than by all the Patients he ever had beside. Sir, both my self, and my Brethren have been very course∣ly used by the Tongues and Pens of these Men, yet shall I never give Your Majesty any sow'r Counsel; I shall rather manifie Your Clemency, that proceeded with these Offenders in a Court of Mercy as well as Justice: Since (as the Re∣verend Judges then declared) You might have justly called the Offenders into another Court, and put them to it in a way
that might have exacted their Lives, for their stirring (as much as in them lay) of Mutiny and Sedition. Yet this I shall be bold to say, and Your Majesty may con∣sider of it in Your Wisdom, That one way of Government is not always either fit or safe, when the Humours of the People are in a continual Change: Especially, when such Men as these shall work upon Your People, and labour to infuse into them such malignant Principles, to introduce a Parity in the Church or Commonwealth. Et si non satis sua sponte in∣saniant, instigare, And to spur on such among them as are too sharply set already: And by this means make and prepare all Advantages for the Roman Party to scorn Vs, and pervert Them. I pray God bless Your Majesty, Your Royal Consort, and Your hopeful Posterity, that You may Live in Happi∣ness; Govern with Wisdom; Support Your People by Ju∣stice; Relieve them by Mercy; Defend them by Power and Success; And Guide them in the true Religion by Your Laws and most Religious Example, all the long and lasting Days of Your Life: Which are and shall be the daily Prayers of Your Sacred Majesty's most Loyal Subject, and Most Dutiful Servant, as most bound, W. Cant.
Arch-Bishop LAVD's SPEECH AT THE CENSURE OF J. Bastwick, H. Burton, and W. Prinn. My LORDS, I Shall not need to speak of the infamous Course of Libelling in any kind: Nor of the Punishment of it, which in some Cases was Capital by the Imperial Laws; as appears, Cod. l. 9. T. 36. Nor how patiently some great Men, very great Men indeed, have born Animo civili (that's Sueton. his word In Jul. c. 75.) laceratam existi∣mationem, The tearing and rending of their Credit and Reputation, with a gentle, nay, a generous Mind. But of all Libels, they are most odius which pretend Religion: As if that of all things did desire to be defended by a Mouth that is like an open Sepulchre, or by a Pen that is made of a sick and a loath∣som Quill. There were Times when Persecutions were great in the Church, even to exceed Barbarity it self: Did any Martyr or Confessor, in those Times, Libel the Governours? Surely no; not one of them to my best Remembrance: yet these complain of Persecution without all shew of cause; and in the mean time Libel and Rail without all measure. So little of kin are they to those which suffer for Christ, or the least part of Christian Religion. My Lords, It is not every Man's Spirit to hold up against the Ve∣nome which Libellers spit. For S. Ambrose, who was a stout and a worthy Prelate, tells us, not that himself, but that a far greater Man than he, that's King David, had found out (so it seems in his Judg∣ment 'twas no matter of ordinary Ability) Grande inventum, a great and mighty Invention, how to swallow and put off those bitter Con∣tumilies of the Tongue In Apol. 1. David. c. 6.: And those of the Pen are no whit less, and spread farther. And it was a great one indeed, and well beseemed the greatness of David. But I think it will be far better for me to look upward, and practise it, than to look downward, and discourse upon it.
In the mean time I shall remember what an Antient, under the name of S. Hierom, tells me *, Indignum est & praeposterum, 'Tis un∣worthy Ad Ocean. de Ferend. Opprob. in it self, and preposterous in demeanour for a Man to be asha∣med for doing good, because other Men glory in speaking ill. And I can say it clearly and truly, as in the presence of God, I have done nothing, as a Prelate, to the uttermost of what I am conscious, but with a single Heart, and with a sincere Intention for the good Govern∣ment and Honour of the Church, and the maintenance of the Orthodox Truth and Religion of Christ, professed, established, and maintained in this Church of England. For my Care of this Church, the reducing of it into Order, the up∣holding of the external Worship of God in it, and the setling of it to the Rules of its first Reformation, are the Causes (and the sole Causes, whatever are pretended) of all this malicious Storm, which hath lowred so black upon me, and some of my Brethren. And in the mean time, they which are the only, or the chief Innovators of the Christian World, having nothing say, accuse us of Innovation; They themselves and their Complices in the mean time being the greatest Innovators that the Christian World hath almost ever known. I deny not but others have spread more dangerous Errors in the Church of Christ; but no Men, in any Age of it, have been more guilty of Innovation then they, while themselves cry out against it: Quis tulerit Gracchos? And I said well, Quis tulerit Gracchos? For 'tis most apparent to any Man that will not wink, that the Intention of these Men, and their Abettors, was and is to raise a Sedition, being as great Incen∣diaries in the State (where they get Power) as they have ever been in the Church; Novatian himself hardly greater. Our main Crime is (would they all speak out, as some of them do) Burton's Apol. p. 110. that we are Bishops; were we not so, some of us might be as passable as other Men. And a great trouble 'tis to them, that we maintain that our Calling of Bishops is Jure Divino, by Divine Right: Of this I have said enough, and in this place, in Leighton's Case, nor will I repeat. Only this I will say, and abide by it, that the Calling of Bishops is Jure Divino, by Divine Right, tho' not all Adjuncts to their Calling. And this I say in as direct opposition to the Church of Rome, as to the Puritan Humour. And I say farther, that from the Apostles times, in all Ages, in all Places, the Church of Christ was governed by Bishops: And Lay-Elders never heard of, till Calvin's new-fangled Device at Geneva. Now this is made by these Men, as if it were Contra Regem, against the King, in Right or in Power. But that's a meer ignorant shift; for our being Bishops, Jure Divino, by Divine Right, takes nothing from the King's Right or Power over us. For though our Office be from God and Christ immediately, yet may we not exercise that Power, either of Order or Jurisdiction, but as God hath appointed us, that is, not in His Majesty's, or any Chri∣stian King's Kingdoms, but by and under the Power of the King gi∣ven us so to do. And were this a good Argument against us, as Bishops, it must needs be good against Priests and Ministers too; for themselves grant that
their Calling is Jure Divino, by Divine Right; and yet I hope they will not say, that to be Priests and Ministers is against the King, or any his Royal Prerogatives. Next, Suppose our Callings, as Bishops, could not be made good Jure Divino, by Divine Right, yet Jure Ecclesiastico, by Ecclesiastical Right, it cannot be denied. And here in England the Bishops are con∣firmed, both in their Power and Means, by Act of Parliament. So that here we stand in as good Case as the present Laws of the Realm can make us. And so we must stand till the Laws shall be repealed by the same Power that made them. Now then, suppose we had no other string to hold by (I say sup∣pose this, but I grant it not) yet no Man can Libel against our Calling (as these Men do) be it in Pulpit, Print or otherwise, but he Libels against the King and the State, by whose Laws we are establi∣shed. Therefore, all these Libels, so far forth as they are against our Calling, are against the King and the Law, and can have no other purpose, than to stir up Sedition among the People. If these Men had any other Intention, or if they had any Christian or charitable desire to reform any thing amiss; why did they not modestly Petition his Majesty about it, that in his Princely Wisdom he might set all things right, in a Just and Orderly manner? But this was neither their Intention nor Way. For one clamours out of his Pulpit, and all of them from the Press, and in a most virulent and unchristian manner set themselves to make a Heat among the People; and so by Mutiny, to effect that which by Law they cannot; and by most false and unjust Calumnies to defame both our Callings and Persons. But for my Part, as I pity their Rage, so I heartily pray God to forgive their Malice. No Nation hath ever appeared more jealous of Religion, than the People of England have ever been. And their Zeal to God's Glory hath been, and at this day is a great honour to them. But this Zeal of theirs, hath not been at all times and in all Persons, alike guided by knowledge. Now Zeal, as it is of excellent use, where it sees its way; so it is very dangerous company, where it goes on in the You may see it in the Examplé of S. Paul him∣self, whose ve∣ry zeal in the darkness of his Vnderstanding, which he then had, made him persecute Christ and his Church, Act. 22. 3, 4. And he was very dange∣rous company then; for he breath'd out threatnings against the Disciples, Act. 9. 1. So true is that of Saint Greg. Naz. Orat. 21. Zelus Iracundiam acuit: All Zeal puts an edge to Anger it self: And that must needs be dangerous in the dark. dark: And these Men knowing the Disposition of the People, have laboured nothing more, than to misinform their knowledge, and misguide their Zeal, and so to fire that into a Sedition, in hope that they whom they causlesly hate, might miscarry in it. For the main scope of these Libels is to kindle a Jealousie in Mens Minds, that there are some great Plots in Hand, dangerous Plots (so Page 5. says Mr. Burton expresly) to change the Orthodox Religion established in England; and to bring in, I know not what, Romish Superstition in the room of it. As if the external decent worship of God could not be upheld in this Kingdom, without bringing in of Popery. Now by this Art of theirs, give me leave to tell you that the King is most desperately abused and wounded in the Minds of his People, and the Prelates shamefully.
The King most desparately: For there is not a more cunning trick in the World, to withdraw the Peoples Hearts from their Sovereign, than to persuade them that he is changing true Religion, and a∣bout to bring in gross Superstition upon them. Aud the Prelates shamefully: For they are charged to seduce, and lay the Plot, and be the Instruments. For his Majesty first. This I know, and upon this occasion take it my Duty to speak: There is no Prince in Christendom more sincere in his Religion, nor more constant to it, than the King. And he gave such a Testimony of this at his being in Spain, as I much doubt whether the best of that Faction durst have done half so much as his Majesty did, in the Face of that Kingdom. And this you, my Lord, the Earl of Holland, and other Persons of Honour, were Eye and Ear Witnesses of, having the happiness to attend Him there. And at this day, as his Majesty (by God's great Blessing both on him and us) knows more, so is he more settled and more confirmed, both in the Truth of the Religion here established, and in Resolution to maintain it. And for the Prelates; I assure my self, they cannot be so base, as to live Prelates in the Church of England, and labour to bring in the Superstitions of the Church of Rome upon themselves and it. And if any should be so foul, I do not only leave him to God's Judgment, but (if these Libellers, or any other, can disdover that his base and irreligious falshood) to shame also, and severe Punishment from the State: And in any just way, no Man's Hand shall be more, or sooner against him, than mine shall be. And for my self, to pass by all the scandalous reproacbes, which they have most injuriously cast upon me, I shall say this only. First, I know of no Plot, nor purpose of altering the Religion established. Secondly, I have ever been far from attempting any thing that may truly be said to tend that way in the least degree: And to these two, I here offer my Oath. Thirdly, If the King had a mind to change Religion, (which I know he hath not, and God forbid he should ever have) he must seek for other Instruments. For as basely as these Men conceive of me, yet I thank God, I know my Duty well, both to God and the King: And I know that all the Duty I owe to the King, is under God. And my great happiness it is (though not mine alone, but your Lordships and all his Subjects with me) that we live under a Gracious and a Religious King, that will ever give us leave to serve God first, and Him next. But were the days otherwise, I thank Christ for it, I yet know not how to serve any Man against the Truth of God, and I hope I shall never learn it. But to return to the business; what is their Art to make the World believe a change of Religion is endeavoured? What? Why forsooth, they say, there are great Innovations brought in by the Prelates, and such as tend to the advancing of Popery. Now that the Vanity and Falshood of this may appear, I shall humbly defire your Lordships to give me leave to recite briefly all the Innovations charged upon us, be they of less or greater Moment,
and as briestly to answer them. And then you shall clearly see, whe∣ther any cause hath been given of these unsavory Libels; and with∣all, whether there be any shew of cause to fear a change of Religi∣on. And I will take these great pretended Innovations in order, as I meet with them. First, I begin with the News from Ipswich. Where the First Page.  Innovation is, that the last Years Fast was enjoyned to be without Sermons in London, the Suburbs, and other infected Places, contrary to the Orders for other Fasts in former times: Whereas Sermons are the only means to humble Men, &c. To this I say First. That an after-Age may without Offence, learn to avoid any visible Inconvenience observed in the former. And there was visible Inconvenience observed in Mens former flocking to Sermons in Infected Places. Secondly, This was no particular Act of Prelates; but the business was debated at the Council-Table, being a matter of State, as well as of Religion. And it was concluded for no Sermons in those Infected Places, upon this Reason, that Infected Persons or Families, known in their own Parishes, might not take occasion upon those by-days to run to other Churches where they were not known, as many use to do, to hear some humorons Men Preach; For on the Sundays, when they better kept their own Churches: The Danger is not so great altogether. Nor Thirdly, is that true, that Sermons are the Only means to humble Men. For though the Preaching of God's Word, where it is performed according to his Ordinance, be a great means of many good Effects in the Souls of Men; Yet no Sermons are the only means to humble Men. And some of their Sermons are fitter a great deal for other Operations: Namely, to stir up Sedition, as you may see by Mr. ; for this his printed Libel was a Ser∣mon first, and a Libel too. And 'tis the best part of a Fast to ab∣stain from such Sermons. 2. The Second Innovation is, Page.  That Wednesday was appointed for the Fast-day, and that this was done with this Intention, by the Example of this Fast without Preaching, to suppress all the Wednesday Lectures in London. To this I answer First, That the appointing of Wednesday for the Fast-day was no Innovation. For it was the day in the last Fast be∣fore this: And I my self remember it so, above forty years since more than once. Secondly, If there be any Innovation in it, the Prelates named not the day; my Lord Keeper, I must appeal to your Lordship: The day was first named by your Lordship, as the usual and fit∣test day. And yet I dare say, and swear too, that your Lordship had no aim to bring in Popery; nor to suppress all, or any the Wednesday Lectures in London. Besides, these Men live to see the Fast ended, and no one Wednesday Lecture suppressed.
3. The Third Innovation Page. 3 is, that the Prayer for seasonable weather was purged out of this last Fast-Book, which was (say they) one cause of Ship-wrecks and tempestuous weather. To this I say, First in the General; this Fast-Book, and all that have formerly been made, have been both made and published by the command of the King, in whose sole Power it is to call a Fast. And the Arch-Bishop and Bishops to whom the ordering of the Book is committed, have power under the King, to put in, or leave out, whatsoever they think fit for the present Occasion; as their Predecessors have ever done before them. Provided that nothing be In contrary to the Doctrine or Discipline of the Church of England And this may serve in the General for all Alterations, in that or any other Fast-Book, or Books of Devotion upon any particular Occasions, which may and ought to vary with several times, and we may, and do, and will justifie, under his Majestys Power, all such Alterations made therein. Secondly, For the particular. When this last-Book was set out, the weather was very seasonable. And it is not the custom of the Church, nor fit in it self to pray for seasonable weather when we have it, but when we want it. When the former Book was set out, the weather was extreme ill, and the Harvest in Danger; Now the Harvest was in, and the weather good. Thirdly,  most inconsequent to say, that the leaving that Prayer out of the Book of Devotions, caused the Shipwrecks and the Tempests which followed. And as bold they are with God Almighty, in saying it was the cause: For sure I am, God never told them that was the cause. And if God never revealed it, they cannot come to know it; yet had the Bishops been Prophets, and foreseen these Accidents, they would certainly have prayed against them. Fourthly, Had any Minister found it necessary to use this Prayer at any one time during the Fast, he might with ease and without Danger, have supplied that want, by using that Prayer to the same purpose, which is in the Ordinary Liturgy. Fifthly, I humbly desire your Lordships to weigh well the Consequence of this great and dangerous Innovation. The Prayer for fair wea∣ther was left out of the Book for the Fast; Therefore the Prelates intend to bring in Popery. An excellent Consequence, were there any shew of Reason in it. 4 The Fourth Innovation Page. 3. is, That there is one very useful Collect left out, and a Clause omitted in another. To this I answer First, As before; It was lawful for us to alter what we thought fit. And Secondly, Since that Collect made mention of Preaching, and the Act of State forbad Sermons on the Fast-days in infected Places, we thought it fit, in pursuance of that Order, to leave out that Collect.
And Thirdly, For the branch in the other, which is the first Collect, though God did deliver our  out of Romish Superstition, yet (God be blessed for it) we were never in. And therefore that clause being  expressed, we thought fit to pass it over. 5. The Fifth Innovation Page. 3. is, That in the sixth Order for the Fast, there is a passage left out concerning the abuse of Fasting in relation to Merit. To this I answer. That he to whom the ordering of that Book to the Press was committed, did therefore leave it out; because in this Age and Kingdom there is little Opinion of Meriting by Fasting. Nay, on the contray, the Contempt and Scorn of all Fasting (save what humorous Men call for of themselves) is so rank, that it would grieve any Christian Man to see the necessary Orders of the Church concerning Fasting, both in Lent and at other set times, so vilified as they are. 6. The Sixth Innovation Page. 3. is, That the Lady Elizabeth and her Prin∣cely Children are dashed (that's their phrase) out of the new Collect, whereas they were in  Collect of the former Book. For this First, The Author of the News knows full well that they are left out of the Collect in the latter Editions of the Com∣mon Prayer-Book, as well as in the Book for the Fast. And this was done according to the Course of the Church, which ordinarily names none in the Prayer but the Right Line descending. Yet this was not done till the King himself commanded it; as I have to shew under his Majesty's Hand. Secondly, I beseech your Lordships to consider, what must be the Consequence here: The Queen of Bohemia and her Children are left out of the Collect, therefore the Prelates intend to bring in Popery; For that (you know) they say, is the end of all these Innovations. Now if this be the end and the Consequence, truly the Libellers have done very dutifully to the King, to poyson his People with this con∣ceit; that the Lady Elizabeth and her Children would keep Popery out of this Kingdom, but the King and his Children will not. And many as good Offices as these have they done the King quite thorow these Libels, and quite thorow his Kingdoms. For My part, I honour the Queen of Bohemia, and her Line, as much as any Man whatsoever, and shall be as ready to serve them, but I know not how to depart from my Allegiance, as I doubt these Men have done. 7. The Seventh Innovation Page. 3. is, That these words (who art the Father of thine Elect and of their Seed) are changed in the Preface of that Collect, which is for the Prince and the King's Children. And with a most spiteful inference, that this was done by the Prelates to ex∣clude the King's Children out of the number of God's Elect. And they call it an intolerable Impiety and horrid Treason. To this I answer, First, That this Alteration was made in my Predecessor's time, before I had any Authority to meddle with these things farther than I was called upon by him
Secondly, This is not therefore to lay any  upon my Predeces∣sor; for he did in that but his Duty: For his Majesty acknowledges it was done by his special Direction, as having then no Children to pray for. And Thirdly, This Collect could not be very old, for it had no being in the Common Prayer Book all Queen Elizabeth's time, she ha∣ving no Issue. The Truth is, it was made at the coming in of King James; and must of necessity be changed over and over again pro ratione Tem∣porum, as Times and Persons vary. And this is the Intolerable Impie∣ty, and horrid Treason they charge upon Vs. In this Method the Innovations are set down in the News from Ipswich. But then in Mr. Burion's News from Friday-street (called his Apology) they are in another Order, and more are added. There∣fore with your Lordship's leave I will not repeal any of these, but go on to the rest, which Mr. Burton adds. 8. The eighth Innovation Burton's Apo∣logy, pag. 2. is, That in the Epistle the Sunday before Ea∣ster, we have put out In, and made it At the Name of Jesus every knee shall bow; which Alteration, he saith, is directly against the Act of Parliament. Here give me leave to tell you, 'tis At the Name of Jesus, in the late Learned Translation made in King James his time. About which many Learned Men of best note in the Kingdom were imployed, be∣sides some Prelates. But to this I Answer: First, 'Tis true, the Common Prayer Book was confirmed by Act of Parliament, and so all things contained in it, at the passing of that Act. But I hope if any thing were false Printed then, the Parliament did not intend to pass those slips for current. Secondly, I am not of Opinion, that if one word be put in for another, so they bear both the same Sense, that there is any great matter done against the Act of Parliament. Thirdly, This can make no Innovation. For In the Name, and At the Name of Jesus, can make no Essential Difference here. And Mr. Pryn (whose Darling business it hath long been to cry down the Honour due to the Son of God, at the mentioning of his saving Name Jesus) knows the Grammar Rule well, In a Place or at a Place, &c. Fourthly, If there were any Errour in the change of In into At; I do here solemnly protest to you, I know not how it came: For authority from the Prelates, the Printers had none; and such a word is easily changed in such a negligent Press as we have in England. Or if any al∣tered it purposely, for ought I know, they did it to gratifie the Preciser sort. For therein they followed the Geneva Translation, and Printed at Geneva, 1557 In Octavo.. where the words are, At the Name of Jesus. And that is 94 years ago; and therefore no Innovation made by us. Fifthly, This I find in the Queen's Injunctions Injunction 52., without either word In or At. Whensoever the Name of Jesus shall be in any Lesson, Sermon, or otherwise pronounced in the Church ('tis injoyned) that due Reve∣rence be made of all Persons, Young and Old, with lowliness of Coursy and uncovering of the Heads of the Men-kind, as thereunto doth neces∣sarily belong, and heretofore hath been accustomed. So here's necessity laid upon it, and custom for it, and both expressed by Authority in the very beginning of the Reformation; and is therefore no Innovation now.
9. The Ninth Innovation Page. 3. is, That two places are changed in the Prayers set forth for the Fifth of November: And ordered to be read (they say) by Act of Parliament. The first place is ohanged thus, from Root out that Babylomish and Antichristian Sect, which say of , &c. Into this form of Words; Root out that Babylonish and Antichristian Sect (of them) which say, &c. The second place went thus in the old: Cut off these Workers of Iniquity, whose Religion is Rebellion. But in the Book Printed 1635, 'tis thus altered; Cut  those Workers of Iniquity, who turn Religion into Rebellion, &c. To this I say, First, 'Tis a notorious Vntruth, that this Book was ordered to be Read by Act of Parliament. The Act of Parliament indeed is Printed before it; and therein is a Command for Prayers and Thanks∣givings every Fifth of November; but not one Word or Syllable for the Form of Prayer: That's left to the Church; therefore here's no Innovation against that Act of Parliament. Secondly, The Alteration first mentioned, that is, That Sect, or That Sect of ; if of so small Consequence, as 'tis not worth the speak∣ing of: Besides, if there be any thing of moment in it, 'tis answer∣ed in the next. Thirdly, Both for that and the second place, which seems of more moment; and so for the rest not only in that Book, but that other also for His Majesty's Coronation; His Majesty expresly commanded Me to make the Alterations, and see them Printed. And here are both the Books with His Majesty's Warrant to each of them. So that herein I conceive I did not offend, unless it were that I gave not these Men no∣tice of it, or asked them leave to obey the King. Against this there can be but two Objections, should Malice it self go to work. The one is, That I moved His Majesty to command the Change. And the other, That now, when I saw my self challeng'd for it, I procured His Majesty's Hand for my security. To these I Answer clearly, First, That I did not move the King, directly or indirectly, to make this Change. And Secondly, That I had His Majesty's Hand to the Book, not now, but then, and before ever I caused them to be Printed; as now they are. And that both these are true, I here again freely offer my self to my Oath. And yet Fourthly, That you may see His Gracious Majesty used not his Power only in commanding this Change; but his Wisdom also; I shall adventure to give you my Reasons, such as they are, why this Alte∣ration was most fit, if not necessary. My first Reason is, In the Litany in Henry VIII. his time It was put into the Litany of Hen. VIII.'s time, as appears in his Primer, with his Injunction before it.: and also under Edward VI. And 'tis in both the Service Books of Edw. VI. both that which was Printed 1549, and in that which was after, Anno 1552. there was this Clause: From the Tyranny of the Bishop of Rome, and all his detestable Enormities, from all false Do∣ctrine, &c. Good Lord deliver us. But in the Litany in Queen Elizabeth's time this Clause about the Pope was left out, and it seems of purpose, for avoiding of Scandal: And yet the Prelates for that not accounted Innovators, or Introducers of Popery. Now 'tis a far greater Scandal to call their Religion Rebellion, than 'tis to call thir chief Bishop Tyrant.
And this Reason is drawn from Scandal, which must ever be avoid∣ed as much as it may. My second Reason is, That the Learned make but Three Religions to have been of old in the World, Paganisns, Judaism, and Christia∣nity. And now they have added a Fourth, which is Turcism, and is an absurd mixture of the other Three. Now if this ground of theirs be true (as 'tis generally received) perhaps it will be of dangerous Consequence sadly to avow, that the  Religion is . That some Opinions of theirs teach Rebellion, that's apparently true, the other would be thought on, to say no more. And this Reason well weighed, is taken from the very Foundations of Religion it self. My third Reason is, Because if you make their Religion to be Re∣bellion, then you make their Religion and Rebellion to be all one. And that is against the ground both of State and the Law. For when di∣vers Romish Priests and Jesaits have deservedly suffered Death for Treason, is it not the constant and just Profession of the State, that they never put any Man to Death for Religion, but for Rebellion and Treason only? Doth not the State truly affirm, That there was never any Law made against the Life of a Papist, quatenus a Papist only? And is not all this stark false, if their very Religion be Rebellion? For if their Religion be Rebellion, it is not only false, but impossible, that the same Man in the same Act should suffer for his Rebellion, and not for his Religion. And this King James of ever blessed Memory understood passing well, when (in his Premonition to all Christian Monarchs Pag. 336.) he saith, I do constantly  that no Papist either in my time, or in the time of the late , ever died for his Conscience. Therefore he did not think their very Religion was Rebellion: Though this Clause passed through Inadvertency in his time. And this Reason is grounded both upon the Practice and the Justice of the Law. Which of these Reasons, or whether any other better, were in His Majesty's Thoughts, when he commanded the Alteration of this Clause, I know not. But I took it my Duty to lay it before you, that the King had not only Power, but Reason to command it. 10. The Tenth Innovation Pag. 3. is, That the Prayer for the Navy is  out of the late Book for the Fast. To this I say, There is great Reason it should. For the King had no declared Enemy then, nor (God be thanked) hath he now.  had he then any Navy at Sea. For almost all the Ships were come in before the Fast-Book was set out. But howsoever, an excellent Consequence it is, if you mark it; The Prayer for the Navy was left out of the Book for the Fast, therefore by that, and such like Innovations, the Prelates intend to bring in Popery. Indeed, if that were a piece of the Prelates Plots to bring in Popery from beyond Sea, then they were mightily overseen that they left out the Prayer for the Navy. But else what Reason or Con∣sequence is in it, I know not, unless perhaps Mr. Burton intended to befriend Dr. Bastwick, and in the Navy bring hither the Whore of Babylon to be ready for his Christening, as he most prophanely Scoffs.
Well: I pray GOD the time come not upon this Kingdom, in which it will be found, that no one thing hath advanced or ushered in Popery so fast, as the gross Absurdities even in the Worship of God, which these Men, and their like, maintain, both in Opinion and Practice. 11. The Eleventh Innovation Page 105. is, The Reading of the Second Service at the Communion-Table, or the Altar. To this, First, I can truly say, That since my own Memory, this was in use in very many Places, as being most proper (for those Prayers are then read which both precede and follow the Communi∣on,) and by little and little this antient Custom was altered, and in those Places first, where the Emissaries of this Faction came to Preach. And now if any in Authority offer to reduce it, this antient Course of the Church is by and by called an Innovation. Secondly, With this the Rubricks of the Common-Prayer Book agree: For the first Rubrick after the Communion tells us, that upon Holy-Days, though there be no Communion, yet all else that's appointed at the Communion shall be read. Shall be read? That's true, but where? Why, the last  before the Communion tells us, That the Priest, standing at the North-side of the Holy Table, shall say the Lord's Prayer, with that which follows. So that not only the Communion, but the Prayers which accompany the Communion (which are commonly called the Second Service) are to be read at the Communion Table. Therefore if this be an Innovation, 'tis made by the Rubrick, not by the Prelates; And Mr. Burton's Scoff, that this Second Service must be served in for Dainties Page 105. [Then the Se∣cond Service, as Dainties, must be said there.], savours too much of Belly and Prophanation. 12. One think sticks much in their Stomachs, and they call it an Innovation Page 105. too. And that is Bowing, or doing Reverence at our first coming into the Church, or at our nearer Approaches to the Holy Table, or the Altar, (call it whether you will) in which they will needs have it, That we Worship the Holy Table, or God knows what. To this I Answer: First, That God forbid we should Worship any thing but GOD Himself. Secondly, That if to Worship GOD when we enter into his House, or approach his Altar, be an Innovation, 'tis a very old one. For Moses did Reverence at the very Door of the Tabernacle, Numb. 20. 6. Hezekiah, and all that were present with him, when they had made an end of offering, bowed and worshipped, (2 Chron. 29. 29.) Da∣vid calls the People to it with a Venite, O come let us Worship, and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker, (Psal. 95. 6.) And in all these Places (I pray mark it) 'tis bodily Worship. Nor can they say, That this was Judaical Worship, and now not to be . For long before Judaism began, Bethel, the House of GOD, was a place of Reverence, (Gen. 28. 17, &c.) Therefore , Of, and To GOD. And after Judaical Worship ended, Venite, Adoremus, as far up wards as there is any track of a Liturgy, was the Introitus of the Priest, all the Latine Church over.
And in the daily Prayers of the Church of England, this was retain'd at the Reformation; and that Psalm, in which is Venite, Adoremus, is commanded to begin the Morning Service every Day. And for ought I know, the Priest may as well leave out the Venite, as the Adoremus; the calling the People to their Duty, as the Duty it self, when they are come. Therefore even according to the Service-Book of the Church of Eng∣land, the Priest and the People both are call'd upon, for external and bodily Reverence and Worship of GOD in his Church. Therefore they which do it, do not Innovate. And yet the Government is so mode∣rate, (God grant it be not too loose therewhile) that no Man is con∣strained, no Man questioned, only religiously called upon, Venite, Ado∣remus, Come, let us Worship. For my own part, I take my self bound to Worship with Body as well as in Soul, when ever I come where God is Worshipped. And were this Kingdom such as would allow no Holy Table standing in its proper place, (and such places some there are) yet I would Worship God when I came into His House. And were the times such, as should beat down Chur∣ches, and all the curious carved Work thereof, with Axes and Hammers, as in Psal. 74. 6. (and such Times have been) yet would I Worship in what place soever I came to Pray, tho there were not so much as a Stone laid for Bethel. But this is the misery, 'tis Superstition now adays for any Man to come with more Reverence into a Church, than a Tinker and his Bitch come into an Ale-house; the Comparison is too homely, but my just Indignation at the Prophaneness of the Times, makes me speak it. And you my Honourable Lords of the Garter, in your great Solem∣nities, you do your Reverence, and to Almighty God, I doubt not, but yet it is versus Altare, towards his Altar, as the greatest place of God's Residence upon Earth. (I say the greatest, yea greater than the Pulpit. For there 'tis Hoc est Corpus meum, This is my Body: But in the Pulpit 'tis at most but Hoc est Verbum meum, This is my Word. And a greater Reverence (no doubt) is due to the Body, than to the Word of our Lord. And so, in Relation, answerably to the Throne where his Body is usually present, than to the Seat whence his Word useth to be proclainted. And God hold it there, at His Word; for, as too ma∣ny Men use the matter, 'tis Hoc est Verbum Diaboli, This is the Word of the Devil, in too many places. Witness Sedition, and the like to it.) And this Reverence ye do when ye enter the Chapel, and when you approach nearer to Offer. And this is no Innovation, for you are bound to it by your Order, and that's not New. And Idolatry it is not, to Worship God towards His Holy Table; For if it had been Idolatry, I presume, Queen Elizabeth and King James would not have practised it, no not in those Solemnities. And being not Idolatry, but true Divine Worship, You will, I hope, give a poor Priest leave to Worship God, as Your selves do: For if it be God's Wor∣ship, I ought to do it as well as You: And if it be Idolatry, You ought not to do it more than I. I say again, I hope a poor Priest may Worship God with as lowly Reverence as you do, since you are bound by your Order, and by your Oath, according to a Constitution of Henry the Fifth, (as appears In Libro Nigro Windesoriensi, p. .) to give due Honour and Reverence, Domino Deo, & Altari ejus, in mo∣dum
Virorum Ecclesiasticorum; That is, to the Lord your God, and to his Altar (for there is a Reverence due to that too, though such as comes far short of Divine Worship) and this in the manner as Ecclesi∣astical Persons both Worship and do Reverence. The Story which led in this Decree is this: King Henry the Fifth, that Noble and Victorious Prince, returning gloriously out of France, sat at this Solemnity; and finding the Knights of the Order scarce bow to God, or but slightly, and then bow towards Him and His Seat, startled at it (being a Prince then grown as Religious, as he was before Victo∣rious) and after asking the Reason; for till then the Knights of the Order never bowed toward the King or his Seat; the Duke of Bedford answer'd, it was setled by a Chapter Act three Years before. Hereupon that Great King replied. No, I'll none of this, till you the Knights do it satis bene, well enough, and with due performance to Almighty GOD. And hereupon the forenamed Act proceeded, that they should do this Duty to Almighty GOD, not slightly, but ad modum Virorum Ecclesiasti∣corum, as low, as well, as decently, as Clergy-Men use to do it. Now if you will turn this off, and say, it was the Superstition of that Age so to do; Bishop Jewell will come in to help me there. For where Harding names divers Ceremonies, and particularly howing themselves, and adoring at the Sacrament, I say, adoring At the Sacrament, not ado∣ring the Sacrament; there Bishop Jewell (that Learned, Painful and Reverend Prelate) approves all, both the Kneeling and the Bowing, and the Standing up at the Gospel (which as antient as it is in the Church, and a common Custom, is yet fondly made another of their In∣novations:) And farther, the Bishop adds, B. Jewell's Reply to Hard∣ing's Answer, Art. 3. Div. 29. That they are all commen∣dable Gestures, and tokens of Devotion, so long as the People understand what they mean, and apply them unto GOD. Now with us the People did ever understand them fully, and apply them to GOD, and to none but GOD, till these Factious Spirits, and their like, to the great dis∣service of GOD and His Church, went about to persuade them that they are Superstitious, if not Idolatrous Gestures: As they make every thing else to be, where GOD is not served slovenly. 13. The Thirteenth Innovation Page. 4, 5; 105. is, The placing of the Holy Table Altar∣wise, at the upper end of the Chancel, that is, the setting of it North and South, and placing a Rail before it, to keep it from Prophanation, which Mr. Burton says, is done to advance and usher in Popery. To this I Answer, That 'tis no Popery to set a Rail to keep Prophana∣tion from that Holy Table; nor is it any Innovation to place it at the upper end of the Chancel as the Altar stood. And this appears both by the Practice, and by the Command and Canon of the Church of England. First, By the Practice of the Church of England. For in the King's Royal Chapels, and divers Cathedrals, the Holy Table hath ever since the Reformation stood at the upper end of the Quire, with the large or full side towards the People. And though it stood in most Parish Churches the other way, yet whe∣ther there be not more reason, the Parish Churches should be made con∣formable to the Cathedral and Mother Churches, than the Cathedrals to them,  leave to any reasonable Man to judge. And yet here is nothing done, either by violence or command, to take
off the Indifferency of the standing of the Holy Table either way, but only by laying it fairly before Men, how fit it is there should be Order and Vniformity; I say still reserving the Indifferency of the standing. But howsoever I would fain know, how any discreet moderate Man dares say, that the placing of the Holy Table Altar-wise (since they will  call it so) is done either to advance to usher in Popery? For did Queen Elizabeth banish Popery, and yet did she all along her Reign from first to last leave the Communion Table so standing in her own Chapel Royal, in St. Paul's and Westmidster, and other places; and all this of  to  on usher in that Popery which she had driven out? since her Death have two Gracious Kings kept out Popery all their , and yet  the Holy Table standing, as it did in the Queen's time, and all of purpose to advance or usher in Popery which they kept out? what's the matter? May the Holy Table stand this way in the  Chapel, or Cathedrals, or Bishops Chapels, and not elsewhere? , if it be decent and fit for God's Service, it may stand so (if  please) in any Church. But if it advance or usher in any  and Popery, it ought to stand so in none. Not hath any King's Chapel any Prerogative (if that may be call'd one!) above any ordinary Church to dis-serve God in, by any Superstitious  Where, give me leave to tell you, that the King and his   most , and with Scorn abused, in the last Leaf of Mr.  Appeal, for such it is. , This appears by the Canon or Rule of the Church of  too, for 'tis plain in the last Injunction of the Queen, That the Holy Table ought to stand at the upper end of the Quire, North and South, or Altar-wise. For the words of the Queen's Injunctions are these. The Holy Table in every Church (mark it I pray, not in the Royal  or Cathedrals only, but in every Church) shall be decently made, and set in the place where the Altar stood. Now the Altar stood at the upper end of the Quire, North and South, as appears before by the  of the Church. And there to set it otherwise, is to set it cross the place, not In the place where the Altar stood: and so, Stulti dum vit ant vitia — weak Men, as these Libellers are, run into one Superstition while they would avoid another; For they run upon the Superstition of the Cross. while they seek to avoid the Superstition of the Altar. So you see here's neither Popery nor Innovation in all the Practice of Queen Elizabeth, or since. These words of the Injunction are so plain, as that they can admit of no shift. And give me leave to tell you, That a very learned Prelate of this Church, and one whom I think these Men will not accuse, as a Man like to advance or usher in Popery, is of the same Opinion: 'Tis my Lord the Bishop of Salisbury. Some difference was lately rising about placing the Communion-Table in a Parish Church of his Diocese. The Bishop, careful to prevent all Disorder, sends his Injunction under his Hand and Seal to the Curate May 17. 1637. and Church-Wardens, to settle that business: In which he hath these two Passages remarkable. I have seen and read the Order. The first Passage is this; By the Injunction of Queen Elizabeth (saith he) and by Can. 82. under King James, the Communion Tables should ordinarily be set and stand with the side to the East Wall of the Chancel.
Therefore this is , since there is Injunction and Canon for it. The other  this, 'Tis Ignorance (saith that learned Bishop) to think that the  of the Holy Table there, relishes of Popery. Therefore, if it do not to much as relish of Popery, it can neither ad∣vance it, nor usher it in.  therefore this is a most odious Slander and Scandal cast upon So here's enough  for   and Rule of the Church of Eng∣land since the .   that time, both in this and other Churches of , in the  and West ordinarily, the Holy Table or Altar stood so:  this Mr. Burton says little. But the Lincolnshire Minister comes in to play the Puritan for that. Concerning which Book ( in my way) and the Nameless Author of it, I shall only  these two things. The one is, that the  from the first word to the  in the Book; for he  on him both for the Name and for the placing of the Holy Table, and the like, to prove, that Generally and Vniversally, and Ordinarily in the whole Catholick Church, both East and West, the Holy Table did not stand at the upper end of the Quire or Chancel. And this he must prove, or he doth nothing. Now when he comes to make his Proofs, they are almost all of them particular, few or none general and concludent; for he neither brings Testimonies out of the General and received Rituals of the Ea∣steru and Western Churches, nor of Fathers and Histories of the Church, which speak in General terms of all, but where they speak of particu∣lar Churches only. So that suppose the most that can be, that is, suppose his Quotations be all truly alledged, and true too in the sense that the Minister takes them, (though in very truth, the , most of them, are neither truly al∣ledged, nor sensed) yet they  but exceptions of, and exemptions from the general Practice. And you know both in Law and Reason, Ex∣ceptio firmat Regulam in non . So that upon the sudden I am not able to resolve, whether this Minister hath done more wrong to himself or his Readers, for he hath abused both. The other is, that in the Judgment of very many learned Men, which have perused this Book, the Author is clearly conceived to want a great deal of that learning, to which he pretends; or  to have written this Book wholly and resolvedly against both his Science and his Conscience. And for my own part, I am  of Opinion, this Book was thrust now to the Press, both to  these Libellers, and, as much as in him lay, to fire both Church and State. And tho I wonder not at the , yet I should wonder at the Bishop of the Diocese (a Man of Learning and Experience) that he should give Testimony to such a Business, and in such Times as these. And once more, before I leave the  Table, Name and Thing, give me leave to put you in mind, that there is no danger at all in the Altar, Name or Thing. For at the   the Reformation, tho' there were a Law for the taking down  Altars, and setting up of Holy Tables in the room of ; yet  places the Altars were not suddenly removed.  Queen in her Injunction to this? Why she says, That there  of great moment in this, sa∣ving Injunct. ultim. for Vniformity, and the  of the Law in that behalf. Therefore for any danger or  was in the Altars, Name or
Thing, they might even then have been left standing, but for Vnifor∣mity, and the Imitation of the Law. But howsoever, it follows in the same Injunction, That when the Al∣tar is taken down, the Holy Table shall be set In (not cross) the place where the Altar stood: which (as is aforesaid) must needs be Altar-wise. 14. The Fourteenth and the last Innovation comes with a mighty Charge, and 'tis taken out of an Epistle to the Temporal Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council. Of which Epistle we got one Sheet, and so (for ought I yet know) that Impression staid: In that Sheet is this Charge; the words are. The Prelates, to justifie their Proceedings, have forged a new Article of Re∣ligion, brought from Rome (which gives them full power to alter the Do∣ctrine and Discipline of our Church at a Blow (as they interpret it) and have foisted it (such is their Language) into the beginning of the 20th Article of our Church. And this is in the last Edition of the Articles, Anno 1628. in affront of His Majesty's Declaration before them, &c. The Clause (which they they say is forged by us) is this, The Church (that is, the Bishops, as they expound it) hath Power to Decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Authority in matter of Faith. (The word is Con∣troversies of Faith, by their leave.) This Clause (say they) is a For∣gery fit to be Examined, and deeply Censured in the Star-Chamber. For 'tis not to be found in the Latin or English Articles of Edward VI. or Queen Elizabeth, ratified by Parliament. And then in the Margent thus, If to Forge a Will or Writing be cen∣surable in the Star-Chamber, which is but a wrong to a private Man; how much more the Forgery of an Article of Religion, to wrong the whole Church, and overturn Religion, which concerns all our Souls? This is a heavy Charge, my Lords; but I thank God the Answer's easie. And truly I grant, that to Forge an Article of Religion in whole or in part, and then to thrust it upon the Church, is a most hainous Crime, far worse than the Forging of a Deed. And is certainly very deeply Censurable in this Court. And I would have humbly besought you, that a deep Censure might have been laid upon it, but that this Sheet was found after, and so is not annext to the Information, nor in Judgment at this present before you. But then, my Lords, I must tell you, I hope to make it as clear as the Day, that this Forgery was not, that this Clause mentioned was added by the Prelates to the Article, to gain Power to the Church, and so to serve our turns. But that that Clause in the beginning of the Article was by these Men, or at least by some of their Faction, rased out, and this to weaken the just Power of the Church to serve their turns. They say (to justifie their Charge) that this Clause is not to be found in the Articles, English or Latin, of either Edw. VI. or Q. Elizabeth. I answer: The Articles of Edw. VI. and those made under Q. Eliza∣beth differ very much. And those of Edw. VI. are not now binding. So whether the Clause be In or Out of them, 'tis not much material. But for the Articles of the Church of England, made in the Queen's time, and now in force, that this Clause for the Power of the Church to De∣cree Ceremonies, and to have Authority in Controversies of Faith, should not be found in English or Latin Copies till the Year 1628. that it was set forth with the King's Declaration before it, is to me a Miracle; but your Lordships shall see the Falshood and Boldness of these Men.
What? Is this Affirmative Clause in no Copy, English or Latin till the Year 1628? Strange: Why, my Lords, I have a Copy of the Articles in English of the Year 1612, and of the Year 1605, and of the Year 1593, and in Latin of the Year 1563, which was one of the first Printed Copies, if not the first of all. For the Articles were agreed on but the Nine and twentieth day of January  1563. And in all these, this Affirmative Clause for the Churches Power is in. And is not this strange boldness then to abuse the World, and falsely to say 'tis in no Copy when I my self, out of my own store am able to shew it into so many, and so antiently. But My Lord's, I shall make it plainer yet: For 'tis not fit concern∣ing an Article of Religion, and an Article of such Consequence for the Order, Truth, and Peace of this Church, you should rely upon my Copys, be they never so many or never so ancient. Therefore I sent to the Publick Records in my Office, and here under my Officers Hand, who is a Publick Notary, is returned me the Twen∣tieth Article with this Affirmative Clause in it. And there is also the whole Body of the Articles to be seen. By this your Lordships see how free the Prelates are from Forging this part of the Article. Now let these Men quit themselves and their Faction, as they can, for their Index Expurgatorins and their foul Ra∣sure in leaving out this part of the Article. For to leave out of an Article is as great a Crime as to put in; And a Main Rasure is as Cen∣surable in this Court as a Forgery. Why, But then my Lords; what is this Mystery of Iniquity? Truly, I cannot certainly tell, but as far as I can I'll tell you. The Articles you see were fully, and fairly agreed to and subscribed in the Year 1563. But after this, in the Year 1571, there were some that refused to subscribe, but why they did so, is not recorded. Whe∣ther it were about this Article or any other I know not. But in Fact this is Manifest, that in that Year 1571, the Articles were Printed both in Latin and English, and this Clause for the Church left out of both. And certainly, this could not be done, but by the malicious cunning of that Opposite Faction. And though I shall spare dead Men's Names where I have not certainty; Yet if you be pleased to look back and consider who they were that Governed businesses in 1571, and rid the Church almost at their pleasure; And how potent the Ancestors, these Libellers began then to grow, you will think it no hard matter to have the Articles Printed, and this Clause left out. And yet 'tis plain, That, after the stir about Subscription in the Year 1571, the Articles were setled and subscribed unto at last, as in the Year 1562, with this Clause in them for the Church: For looking far∣ther into the Records which are in mine own Hands, I have found the Book of 1563 subscribed by all the Lower House of Convocation, in this very Year of Contradiction, 1571, Dr. John Elmar (who was after Lord Bishop of London) being there Prolocutor: Alexander Nowel Dean of St. Paul's, having been Prolocutor in 1563, and yet living and present and subscribing in 1571. Therefore, I do here openly in the Star-Chamber charge upon that pure Sect this foul Corruption of falsifying the Articles of the Church of England; let them take it off as they can. I have now done, and 'tis time I should, with the Innovations charg∣ed upon the Prelates, and fit to be answered here.
Some few more there are, but they belong to matter of Doctrine, which shall presently be answered, Justo Volumine, at large, to satis∣fie all Well-Minded People. But when Mr. Burton's Book which is the Main one, is answered (I mean his Book no this Railing) neither Prynn, nor Bastwick; nor any Attendants upon Rabshakeh, shall by me or my care be answered. If this Court find not a way to stop these Libellers Mouths and Pens, for me they shall rail on till they be weary. Yet one thing more, I beseech you, give me leave to add. 'Tis Mr. Burton's Charge Page 175. upon the Prelates. That the Censures formerly laid upon Malefactors, are now put upon God's Ministers for their Vertue and Piety. A heavy charge this too. But if he or any Man else can shew that any Man hath been punished in the High Commission, or elsewhere, by the Prelates, for Vertue and Piety, there is all the Reason in the World we should be severely punished our selves. But the Truth is, the Vertue and Piety for which these Ministers are punished, is for Preaching Schism and Sedition, many of their Sermons being as bad as their Libels, As Burton's Libell was one of his Sermons first. But whether this stuff have any Affinity with Vertue and Piety, I submit to any Christian Reader. And yet Mr. Burton is so confident of his Innocency, even in this Cause wherein he hath so fouly carryed himself, that he breaks forth into these words, Page 7. I never so much as once dreamed, that Impiety and Impudency it self, in such a Christian State as this is, and under such a graci∣ous Prince, durst ever thus publickly have called me in Question, and that upon the open Stage, &c. You see the boldness of the Man, and in as bad a Cause, as (I think) in this kind ever any Man had. I shall end all with a passage out of S. Cyprian, Lib. 1. Ep. 3. when he, then Bishop of Carthage, was bitterly railed upon by a pack of Schismaticks, his answer was, and 'tis now mine; They have railed both bitterly and falsly upon me, and yet non oportet me paria cum illis facere, it becomes not me to answer them with the like either Levities or Revilings, but to speak and write that only which becomes Sacerdotem Dei, a Priest of God. Neither shall I in this give way (though I have been extremely vili∣fied) to either Grief or Passion to speak, remembring that of the Psal∣mist, Psal. 37. 8. Fret not thy self, else shalt thou be moved to do Evil. Neither yet, by God's Grace, shall the Reproaches of such Men as these make me faint or start aside, either from the Right-way in matter of practice (they are S. Cyprian's words again Ib. p. 10.) or, a certa Regula, from the certain Rule of Faith. And since in former times, some spared not to call the Master of the House, Beelzebub, how much more will they be bold with them of his Houshould, as it is in St. Matthew 10. 25. And so bold have these Men been; but the next words of our Saviour are, Fear them not. I humbly crave Pardon of your Lordships for this my necessary length, and give you all hearty thanks for your Noble Patience, and your Just and Honowable Censure upon these Men, and your unani∣mous dislike of them, and defence of the Church. But because the business hath some Reflexion upon my self, I shall forbear to censure them, and leave them to God's Mercy and the King's Justice. FINIS.
