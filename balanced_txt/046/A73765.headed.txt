Good Newes to Christendome. Sent to a Venetian in Ligorne, from a Merchant in ALEXANDRIA. Discouering a wonderfull and strange Apparition, visibly seene for many dayes togither in Arabia, ouer the place, where the supposed Tombe of MAHOMET (the Turkish Prophet) is inclosed: By which the learned Arabians prognosticate the Reducing & Calling of the great Turke to Christianitie. With many other notable Accidents: But the most remarkable is the miraculous rayning of Bloud about ROME.

THE TRANSLATOR to the Reader. Gentle Reader: I Confesse vnto you, when this let∣ter came first into my hand; which was about the 20 of De∣cember, brought as it should seeme by some of the last Vene∣tian company, I read it as a thing according to the Italian phrase, trouata or bugiarda; and christned it with this opinion, that it could march in no other rancke of veritie, then amongst our selues the Sussex Serpent, the German Ghosts, and the great Armie met in Tar¦tarie marching by the Caspian shore ouer Taurus, all which of my owne knowledge came out of the shop of invention, and were beholding more to deuise, then ei∣ther religion or discretion: so that in a manner I dis∣claimed the translating of it, and put it from me with a kinde of contracted brow: but in truth there were cer∣taine
reasons, which got the masterie ouer my Iudgment, and kept that a while predominant against further pre∣sumption. First, the difficultie of the stile, being my self a very poore Linguist. For had not the pulling hooke of Florios Dictionarie brought many words neerer vnto me, they had all passed for strangers, and those which you haue, meerely come from the apprehension of the sen∣tence in the coherence of the matter, rather then the par∣ticular signification of the words by themselues. Se∣condly, the time, wherein we liue, not like that concise Historiographer Cornelius Tacitus, who spake what he thought, and wrote what he spake; but we as soldiers vnder good Commanders, who must simply obey, and though neuer so wise, dispute not a word by way of con∣testation with the busines imposed. Thirdly, a priuate conference with some Italians, who only put it off with a shrug of the shoulder, when any thing is distasting vn∣to them: although some of them went further, and cryed out aloud, as their manner is, Cancro and Cazzo when they dislike a thing. Last of all, my owne poore affaires, which haue busied me otherwise, and out of the rules of moralitie tyed me to the preuention of wants, and that intolerable and insupportable vexation to depend vpon any mans bountie. For questionles Friendship now adaies is but like a fire from a painted cloth, which for all the braue show reflecteth no warmth: so that I may
well conclude with the Dutchman, he neuer fared worse then when he wisht for his dinner: notwithstanding all these reasons, and some thing else more pleasantly enfor∣ced, the importunitie of my freinds, and that same auri sacra fames, got the vpper hand of nicitie, and not on∣ly put the booke into my hand, but extracted this poore revolution out of a barren spring, which more and more I confesse opened her selfe from my owne affection to the matter and poore experience of certaine repinings euen amongst the Turks themselues, against the long pro∣traction of Mahomets returne, being now full 40 yeere elapsed beyond their owne account, and his promise to bring them glad tidings of a new Paradice: and in truth when I considered those excellent praedictions of Scrip∣ture, that Antichrist shall not only be discouered, but euen punished in this world; that the Iewes should be recalled, and all apparantly to be seene before that doome of doomes, and scourge of incredulitie, the terror of the last iudgement, I cast vp a new account for the entertaining this relation, and rancked it thus in the maniple of my endeuors, which though it troupe with a file or two, yet according to the straitnes of the passage may serue the turne, as well as a greater Armie, or stronger forces. Accept it then, good Reader, and if you be not curious concerning the fullnes of truth, and infallibilitie of the matter; you may make this bulrush of noueltie hold vp
your head in the calmer waters of securitie, that you sink not ouer head and eares into pride, contempt, and care∣lesnes. First, considering God hath such a worke to bring to passe, and he will finish it in his due time. Secondly, that although the Vrim and the Thummim cease, and miracles are very sparing; yet the heauens declare the glory of God, and many fearefull accidents haue bin prefigured by apparition. Thirdly, that therefore the heauens burne first to light vs the way to repentance, and seeing there must come a dissolution of all things, to prepare our hearts to put confidence in nothing: Fourth∣ly, and that we be not so stupefied, as not to admire the Apocalyps of hidden mysteries, but verily belieue there is something to be done, which we cannot apprehend by reason. Last of all, to continue our holy duties, especi∣ally priuate prayers, and contrition, which shall so molli∣fie our hard hearts, that they shall make the lifting vp of our hands as incense, and by way of pro∣pitiation moue God to continue his mercies, and auert his iudgments from vs.
TO THE MAGNIFI∣CENT SIGNIOR ALUISO CANDIDO, of the familie of Mori∣sini, resident at LEGORNE, as Gouer∣nor of the Venetian Factorie there. Right worthy: ACcording to the trust re∣posed in me, I made my commorance in Allex∣andria, all the while the goods were vnloding out of the Castor & Pol∣lux of Leuca: wherein I receiued those balles of silke, and roules of gold, for which I presently trucked with Eleazar Bedly the Iew, dwelling in
the Semiter streete of the tribe of Isachar, and re∣ceiued in sultaneses and vncut stones, what I thought correspondent to the value, all which I haue returned vnto you by my booke of ac∣counts, vnder the trust of Bartholomeo Ioco the Florentine, who standeth charged & is accoun∣table for the same: the greater stuffs and chests of glasses are entred into the blancks of the cu∣stome-house, and you shall receiue the bill of Beniamin Hely the Iew, who is chiefe farmer vn∣der the Bashâ for the same: and so when I had thus ordered your businesse with some cheere∣full confidence, that you should receiue 4. for one; I tooke the opportunitie of a Turkish Car∣misall, and went presently to Cayro: we tooke the middle streame: for you must know, that Nilus brancheth out with 7. heads into the midland sea, & hauing a pleasant wind North∣west and by north, quickly saluted the riuer in her fulnesse, which without controuersie had driuen vs backe with the swiftnesse of his cur∣rent, had not the goodnesse of our sailes coun∣terchecked the violence of his speede, so that we made three daies iorney of this passage and although I doe not accustome to fill vp a pri∣uate letter with publike discourses, either con∣cerning
Topography or Poligraphy, yet cannot I o∣uer passe an accident that happened vnto vs the second day: For a little a fore noone we heard a great cry among the reedes, and wondring what it was, we might well perceiue it was no∣thing but a crocadile howling ouer a woman, whom it had caught? as if a heard of wolues had bin comming downe the mountaine to barke at the moone. And truly Good Sir, it is strange to relate, how rauenous and fell in de∣sires these creatures are of women, and will hunt them extreamely by the sent, imitating the Allegators of Guinea, neuer to show their bodies till they can obteine their pray: yea such is their manner, that they will passe by children and men, and take onely the oportunitie to surprise the women, whom they will strip as hansom∣ly of their apparell, after they haue brought them to their nests, as if they had bin taught a kind of cunning not to be combred with their sluttishness: yet must I not let passe this secret of nature, that they commonly vse to pinch the necke and head so at the first, that the mise∣rable wretch left to a pray findeth a curtesie in the dispatch of her life, for otherwise it were a thousand deaths to be so long a dying, consi∣dering
she is three howres a howling ouer the body, before she deuoure it, of which yet how rauenous so euer she be, she leaues the head on∣ly vntouched, but after she hath done howling, she eates, after eating she weepes, after weeping she sleepes, & then, they are many times slaine, and their young ones stolne from them: this was the voice we heard, and within an hower after we met a boat of Aegiptians, who came to seeke the woman, and discouered vnto vs, that she was a poore mans wife, that had beene to gather reedes that morning with her husband, and by reason of some displeasure, thought to be reuenged by sequestring her selfe, and so was surprised by the serpent, as a warning to o∣ther women, not to make euery small vnkind∣ness, the author of a lumpish countenance, or a sullen heart: the next day we aproached the great Citie, of which to talke neuer so little, would make my letter to great, and besides you haue bin in these parts your selfe, & make dai∣ly vse of most vberant relations, & remarkable circumstances. It was not long ere I prepared my lodging, nor long ere Signior Stephano Del∣phino came vnto me, who finding more conue∣niency in mine then his owne, quickly setled
himselfe to beare me company, nor long ere the great Carauan troup of marchants ariued from Ormus, who came the next way ouer Ara∣bia with 600. Camels, and 200. Arabian horse for their Conuoy, whose intertainement for 5. weekes cost the Merchants 3000. Checkinoes a∣mongst them: they onely taried a day and a night to make themselues drunke; which they may quickly doe. For though the wine of Pa∣lestina, which we much vented here, be reasona∣ble good, yet as if they would pleasure Bacchus with an vnsatiate desire to cellebrate his Orgies, they intermingled the berries of Aethiopia, whose fulsome iuyce doe rather intoxicate the braine, then quench the thirst: The next day they de∣parted, and the next day I singled out the com∣panie, to finde what Italians were amongst them: For in a word I neuer saw so many stran∣gers in one iourney and agreeing so well toge∣ther, the report of it was pleasant, but when I heard it from their owne mouthes, it added both delight & contētmēt, I could both name the parties and the places of their aboad. But because I aime at another marke I will not vn∣furnish my quiuer to spend a rouing shaft to no purpose, but in a word, here were many of my
acquaintance, amongst whome only Siluano Gritti and Bartholomeo Caponi with two friers, one an Augustine, another of the order of Serui, lodged in the same house with vs: They spent three daies in rest, and rested the night very soundly, yet the friers were many times iang∣ling, and so angred Signior Stephano, that ouer-passionate one night he bad the deuill take them, whether they crossed themselues or no: the darkness interdicted my discouerie, but I will be sworne, I heard them thump their breasts to my bed, and I intreated my Gent: to let them alone. Oh, said the Mendicant frier, lit∣tle do you know the disceptation betweene vs, and lesse may we instruct you in it, till a fitter opportunity. For we haue such a strange sto∣ry to discourse vpon, as will spend a day in the Epitome, and make all Europe to wonder in the exemplification. Truly good Sir, the very Emphasis of his words amased me, and the ouer desire of in∣struction led me presently to the way of vigi∣lancy, and I sat vp in my bed, as if I meant to heare a tale indeede, had not Signior Stephano made me also the subiect of his anger, and bad me go out of the bed, if I was so womanish and
idle, that I could not tarry til day light, to heare a lying tale of a frier. Till this the Augustine frier was silent, but now in some distemperature raised his passion, as high as euer Signior Stephanoes was, telling him to his face, it was spoke like a Lutherane, and Heretick, to lay any such imputation on men of their qualitie, religious obseruants, and father-confessors. For they made a conscience of tel∣ling an vntruth, and acknowledged it more then a Veniall sin to countenance a lie through the credit of any religious order: well; said Sig∣nior Stephano if you will not lie in your words, yet I pray you lie still in your beds, and it shall be part of my penance, to acknowledge mine error, and make a retractation of offending you: This answere made way to the sedation of this vnquietnesse, and so we gaue ouer our parlee, and made some vse of a mornings sleepe. The next day the friers of themselues remem∣bring their Matutine howers, after deuotion was ouerpassed, came voluntarilie into our chamber, and with a small preamble of pacifi∣cation preuailed so much with my compani∣on, (who by this time was as desirous of the
nouelty, as my selfe) that we arose, and because they would not bee interrupted in their dis∣course, we made a short repast together, and so locking the dore to vs, attended the poore Men∣dicant; who thus began. My Brother and I about the tenth of September, embarked our selues from Ormus, and came to Catara, where the Christian Carauan was almost ready for their voyage to Cayro, but before I proceed any further, I will be plaine to tell you the occasion of our going thither; 1. partly for Curiosity; 2. partly for Deuotion; 3. partly for Wealth. 1. First, for curiosity, the desire of acquain∣taince with forraigne Countries, and the wil∣lingnesse to put the Practique in the other scale against the Theory; or, if you please, to make our superficiall reading the sweeter by industrious experience, taught vs the way to conceiue, that all Countries might be nationall to a wise man. 2. Secondly, concerning Deuotion, hauing long since heard, that the Persians in this place condiscended euen against the rule of their Al∣choran, to communicate with certaine Portingall Friers, about the Verity of both Religions, wee
thought it not amisse to put it to the triall, whe∣ther we might attaine to such a meritorious act as the Conuersion of a Mahumetane. 3. Thirdly, concerning Wealth, at the end of August there is a generall fishing for Pearle, by reason that the Oysters in this hot moneth re∣sort to the shore, and as if nature had taught them to breathe for aire, they gape, as it were in sholes, and then the fishers, and such as are appointed for this purpose, throw little peble∣stones into their mouthes, and so keepe them from closing againe; and thus are their Pearles kindly taken out, and knowne to be full ripe by their colour. For you must consider the Pearles growe as the meat in bignes, and yeeld great plentie being soft, but afterwards most worth of estimation, as she is Orientall, the shell makes that we call Mother of Pearle, and in the same they are ranked together like teeth in ones mouth, as if they were couched in a bed of purpose; sometimes 15. or 16. in a shell, onely the Vnion hath his name of being alone, and I thinke is priuiledged with extraordinary great∣nesse by being alone: Now at euery draught (or if you will, course of separation) they haue a custome by way of gratuitie, to giue to such
religious men as are resident amongst them, to some more, somelesse, according as affection shall induce them, so that for my part such as they are, I haue 500. to shew you: at Catara we had diuers camels, that came from Iafu and Ca∣tiffa: and within three daies according to their custome 200. Arabian horsse came from Zoar and Cazape: there was one principall Aga and 4. vnder Captaines, and so in seuerall companies we prepared for the great desert of Elact, passing such mountaines and strange woods, that the voiage alone were worthy the description; in regard we found snow in greater aboundance, then is in mount Senese, & so many wild beasts both on the mountaines, and in the woodes, that we lay not one night without a hedge of fier, & in seuerall companies we made a show as it were of a burning campe, and both Lions and Tigers came to see, what we did, though they durst not approach, we made thirty daies of this trauell, and ere we came to Mecha had only sight of 3. Townes, for whose sake we fetched a great compass, although the pretence was to auoide the hugest hills, and so we went from Catara to Lagana to Salata and Gacha: from thence loding our camells with many skinnes
and teeth of beasts, as we vnloded them of our prouision, we came in good time to Mecha. I cannot call it a city because it is vnwalled, nor a village, because it hath 8000. houses in it, nor rich because the opulent merchant lies at Liden a port towne vpon the red sea, some 50. Italian mile from Mecha, nor poore because it is so po∣pulous, for the resort of so many thousand strangers that come hither to view the tombe of Mahomet, in which (as I my selfe was) they are all deceiued: for although he was borne heere, and hath Charactered with his Fame one of the gloriousest stories in the world, yet was he not buried heere, but by a strange policie translated ouer a great desert, to Medina Talnabi, where at this hower is both his Temple and his Sepulcher; by the way you come to the pretty towne of Tacine: & howsoeuer any man presumes of his own cunning, & better intelli∣gence, yet from what coast soeuer he comes, he must go to Mecha first, and their receiue a ticket from the Beglerbeag; for which he paies halfe a florence ducket, ere he can be admitted into the Conuoy for Medina: a littell apprehension brought vs to the knowledge of these things, and so by generall consent, my brother and I
to cure our vnderstanding the better, which was almost vlcerated with strāge variety both of report and historie, went thither in person about the end of September, to be beholding to our owne experience against opinion: But be∣fore we came thither, we met with many pas∣sengers, as it were distracted with feare, and when we came found all the country confoun∣ded at a vision or apparition, which had lasted for a fortnight, and so continuing: 7. daies longer, affrightted the people, and the rather because no man durst interpret the same, or could in∣deede be beholding to discouery for the truth; only one of the Deruices, astonished them with a sudden boldnesse, and because heere were ma∣ny of the race of Mahomet, and some Doctors of the law, who repugning the oratory, rather be∣leeued Naturalls and Lunaticks, whom indeede they immagine extraordinarily inspired with a Supernaturall Spirit. the poore Preest was much offensiue in his discourse to them all; so they conspired against him, and put him to death, by which occasion heere are Foure remarka∣ble things to be considered, 1. First the vision it selfe. 2. Secondly his oration, 3. Thirdly the man∣ner of his execution. 4. Fourthly what a Der∣uice is.
Concerning the vision about the 20. of Septem∣ber, there happened so great a tempest, that there was as it were a sencible darknesse about mid∣night, so fearefull a thunder, that those, which were asleepe were a wakened at the same, and those which were awake, besides themselues: at last a voice like lightning made a strange rup∣ture, and with Significant Arabian Characters so o∣pened the thicke cloudes, and dispelled the va∣powres that with a kinde of stench, & suffoca∣ting smoke the darknes departed, & the people heard, and the rest read it to this purpose, O why will yee beleeue in lies? For when the storme was appeased, and that the serene ellement presen∣ted herselfe to their veiwe, they might easily read these words in the firmament. Some two howres after betweene to and three in the mor∣ning, there appeared a woman all in white com∣passed with the beames of the Sunne, her counte∣nance was amiable and cheerefull, and she held in her hand a written booke: she had no soo∣ner mounted out of the North west and by West, to her full height and radiance, but round a∣bout the East, and Sowth many armies of Turkes, Persians, Arabians, Moores and such like appeared, rancked as it were with martiall discipline, and
ready to charge vpon her, but shee with an vn∣daunted courage, kept her standing, and vsed no other meanes, but only opened the booke, at the sight whereof the whole army fled, and presently all the lamps about Mahomets tombe were extinguished. For as soone as euer the apparision or vision vanished, which was com∣monly an hower before Sunne rising, a pleasant murmuring wind was heard, to whose erupti∣on they imputed the putting out of the lampes. For you must vnderstand, that though the windowes of the temple, were dooble barrd with iron, and richly guilt, well glazed and cu∣riously cemented, yet the storme came vpon them with such impetuositie, that neither glass nor iron withstood the violence: the Temple, itselfe is verie high, made with a rotunde and cu∣be fashion, it hath manie galleries, yet none so neere in approch, as to discouer, how the Tombe is fastned: only the common opinion is, that it is made of steele, and by cunning im∣posture placed in the Center of the Church, vnder a great Adamant, whose vertue attracted it to the top, this the lamps shew plainely, that ther hangs such a coffin: For 3000. lampes continu∣ally, night and day make a most resplendant
show about the galleries, but yet how the cof∣fin is fastned, doe not discouer: onely my bro∣ther and I learnt thus much, that the coffin is indeede most cunningly mortised into the roofe, and hath nothing in it, but the first Al∣cheron originally writ by Sergius a monck, of the first order that euer was, which contracted with him; who liued to see the people appre∣hend, that the Angells had drawne him to hea∣uen, and kept his monument with their conti∣nuall guard about it: The monck indeed bu∣ried the body iust vnder the place, and liued so long, that he saw this position of the religion ratefied, that it was Capitall for any man to dis∣pute of the veritie of the storie: The ancient pilgrims I meane Turks of Maho∣mets race, who after they haue visited this place neuer cut their haire, were much exanima∣ted, and so exasperated at this accident, that they wrecked their anger vpon the poore Priest, who, for his plaine dealing paid for all. 2. This is the Second thing considerable: For his discourse tended to this purpose: Aya∣ma Horranda: which is as much as Honourable troope of auditors, who knowes not but the
God, that made the heauen and earth by his instrument, our Prophet Mahomet, hath chosen vs of all the nations of the world to be his se∣cret people, and for this purpose raised the great Othoman to expatiate his power, and en∣large the Turkish Empire: For the world had neuer but three true religions, euery one of which had three principall Prophets: First God chose the Iewes, and wrought wonders for them in Aegipt, and Canaan vnder the conduct of that same Prophet Moises; who prescribed them a law, which had both bles∣sings and cursings, wherein questionlesse, if they had held the beame of integrity vp aright, no doubt he would haue bin as an inpregnable wall of brasse about them, and terrified their enemies with an hedge of fier; as they vse a∣gainst beasts in the wildernesse: but when neither promises nor threatnings, blessings nor iudgements, prosperity, nor aduersity, could keepe these people close to their maker, but they proued obstinate and rebellious, yea such refractary delinquents, that they denied their God, and committed Idolatrie in despight, and made their sonns goe through the fier (an ex∣orbitant deuice of the Deuill: then God not on∣ly
gaue them ouer to diuers captiuities, but at last extirped them and dissipated them ouer the earth, like chaffe before the winde, so that by lamentable experience we see, they haue now neither King, nor Preest, nor law, nor kingdome, nor gouernment, nor city, nor any countrey of their owne; notwithstanding God would not be vnfurnished of seruitors, but pre∣sently raised a new Prophet who taught the reli∣gion of Christianity, and which is a wonder to relate: For all they crucified this good man, & condemned him for a deceiuer of the people, neither taken with the piety of his life, nor ap∣prehending the greatnesse of his miracles, nei∣ther wondring at his person, nor admitting of his doctrine, yet after he was dead the very re∣port of a few fisher men, made that impression into the harts of the people, that the mightiest Emperors and kings of the world, vailed their bo∣nets to his very title, and laied their crownes downe, to be commanded by his ministers; But it should seeme they grew as corrupt as the Iewes, falling into a maine devision of their Church, with the distinction of East and west: erecting most grosely Idolatry againe, with set∣ting vp of images, and a nomber of most gew∣gaw
foppish ceremonies, besides corruption of life and personall falts in many impious brea∣ches of their law, so that God was weary of them to, and not only sent divisions amongst them, but forsooke them in the midst of their violent race to gormandize and ease, lashing their sides with the whipps of forraine people, and dispossessing them of their chiefest cities Ierusalem and Constantinople to the contristation of their hearts, and irrecouerable vexation of their soules: yet still is God the gouernour of the world, and prouides himselfe of another Prophet and people, raising our great Mahomet, & giuing way to our nation to open the store∣house of his wonders to all the world, and to hold the victorie of many nations the stronger vnto vs, with an vnvanquishable arme, so that no doubt we shall thriue with a perpetuitie, if we can serue this God aright, and take warning by the relapse of others, not to degenerate from the people of God indeede, but obserue them with the same faith and trust, as they are com∣mitted vnto vs. But alas I tremble to speake it, what haue we done, and what haue we seene, wee haue transgressed in euery point, and from a premeditated wilfulnesse abrogated our first
constitutions, so that God is not only angry, but hath manifested it by wonderfull signes & tokens, keeping back our Prophet from vs, who as you know prefixed a time to returne, with the full consummation of all happinesse to his people, so that full 40. yeares are elapsed be∣yond his limitation, and our account, where∣vpon this fearefull vision is a prediction of great troubles and alteration: For either doth the opening of the booke in the womans hand portend our manifest faling away, from the first scope and intent of our law, whereat as ashamed the whole armed multitude departed, confounded with the guil∣tinesse of their owne consciences: or else it sig∣nifies some other booke, in which we haue not yet redd, and against which neither force nor pollicy (as it should seeme) shall preuaile. so that to speake with an vndanted confidence of mercy from my God for telling the truth; I am a fraide our religion will be proued adulte∣rate, & our Prophet discouered for Collusion, & an∣other brought from the touchstone of truth, for the purer mettaile, & so this Christ that they talke of, shall shine as glorious as the sunne & set vp his name with euerlasting eternity.
Till this, the company were silent, but when they heard him so audatious, they cried out vp∣on this blasphemy, and taking aduantage of their law, which makes all blasphemy Capitall, they presently condemned him by a definitiue sentence, and acquainting the Beglerbeag with all the occurrences, had both his consent and warrant to put him to death. 3. This is the third remarkable thing, which I proposed, because he died not the ordinary death amongst them, which is commonly ei∣ther to tie about his necke a huge stone or pel∣let, & so cast him into the sea; or else to strangle him with a string made of sinues, like our bow∣stringes, for which executions certaine mutes are alwaies ready, who cast it ouer his head with a riding knot, and so two pulling one way, and two another, quickly thrattle him, & many times with the violēce euen sūder the wine pipe in twaine: but they tooke him by the way of torturing, & striping of him gaue him first the Corbatch, which was 100. blowes on the soles of his feet, with a flat leuer euen to the dra∣ing of bloud, the poore man stil crying out on the woman that opened the booke. Then they tooke a Bulls pizell, and beat him all ouer to
the cracking of his sinewes, last of all they laid, him vpon a wheele, and with an Indian sword made of sinewes halfe an inch thick, a full yard long, a handfull broad, onely it encreased to∣ward the point like a fishes taile, brake his bones all to peeces, the Preest crying to the last gasp O thou woman with the booke saue me, and so yeelded vp his soule, no man knew to whome: nor indeede how to demeane them∣selues: For the same instant was a fearefull tem∣pest, and the Beglerbeag by the consent of the Muftie dispatched certaine of the Spahies to the port of Sidon, that so they might acquaint the Emperor at Constantinople with all these occurren∣ces the sooner. 4, The Fourth thing considerable was the explication of this order of Deruices, who are more significantly called Turners, they are of the lowest degree and strictest order amongst them, much like our Capuchines, they liue in con∣templation, and seeme rauished with the appre∣hension of the ioyes of paradise. For they preach nothing but abstinence, and with the Platonist inferr the immortality of the soule: on the daie of solemnity, which is our friday, they meete all together in one quadrant, or if you
will some rotunda, which is gallered round a∣bout for the people to be sequestred in the hea∣ring and viewing their ceremonies, which on this day commonly last three houres: the prin∣cipall of these Preests, all the rest sitting crosse legd in the quadrant, raiseth vp himselfe vnto a certaine pulpit, before which, such as haue beene pilgrims at Mecha with shagg and long haire are seated, and on a desk lie their bookes, both of Persian and Arabian character: thus ad∣uanced for the better accommodating his speech to the auditory, he preacheth an hower, and euer as he names the God that giues them bread, a murmuring silence much like our cu∣stome at the name of Iesu, is heard amongst the people with low bending of their bodies, but not a word spoken. After his discourse certaine musick begins, and a song of thanksgiuing is distinctly pronounced, which finished, the Preest, that preacht comes into the quadrant a∣mongst the rest, and leadeth a kinde of mea∣sures, with a soft and sober gate; according to the modulent sound of the musick, going fast∣er, and faster, as the musique increaseth, they continuing in the gesture, of looking vp to heauen, and holding vp their hands, till they
turne round as fast as they can, which lasteth a full quarter of an hower, so that either by faint∣nesse or by custome, they fall downe flat vpon the ground, being all in a swet, & so lie grouel∣ing, til they haue recouered their former breath & strength, certaine officers in the mean while casting mātels ouer them, least they catch cold: this turning hath foure diuisions, and lasteth a full houre, but time ouercommeth all things, and so this solemnitie receiueth her period, on∣ly the Priest, that preacht, returneth backe a∣gaine to his pulpit, and after another song, blesseth the companie, who presently depart. But you must vnderstand, that no man out of the galleries hath his shoes on, nor in any of their Mosques, though they passe but through. Besides, they are of great account, and some of the fantastiques amongst them, will vndertake to interpret dreames and visions, and as we say, tell fortunes: they commonly discouer the strange gesture of naturals and lunaticks, who are vnmocked, vnhurt amongst the people, and so reuerenced with the better sort, that they verily beleeue some inspiration and ex∣traordinarie infused spirit belongs vnto them.
After the Priests execution, and that the whole country grew tumultuous through the intricatenes and fearefull disputing of this Vi∣sion, my brother and I, to preuent further dan∣ger, hasted to Cayro, and in good time, as you saw, came orderly with the Carauan, onely the last night there hapned this disceptation be∣tweene vs: that the opening of the booke in the Vision must needs signifie our Bible; to which my hastines inferred, not by way of con∣tradiction, but by diuersitie of argument, that then surely we doe ill to shut the booke, that the people may not read; which my Augustine brother plainely told mee was schismaticall. For the booke might be opened to the Clergie, though not to the Laitie: whereupon I repli∣ed, then belike the Laitie must know no other, then what we relate vnto them: great reason too (said my brother) the letter is death to ig∣norant men, and it is sufficient for such as re∣maine in other callings, to vnderstand no more, then properly belongs to their saluation: I still opposed, whereby our conference grew to vnkindnes, and so resteth, till a fitter oppor∣tunitie for the deciding. Well said Signior Stephano, agree as well as you
can; but to this I agree, that as I am much a∣mased at your discourse, so I am resolued, that this presageth the conuersion of the Turks to Christianitie; therefore let vs haste home into Italie, and there we shall know what to trust vnto, or at least both secure our selues from the confusions of these Kingdomes, and be able to furnish our vnderstanding with a better cer∣taintie of these ambiguities. I told them I would accompanie them to Alexandria, but I could yet passe no further, till I had receiued letters from Florence for my discharge: and so we ordred our affaires accordingly, and com∣ming with the streame, tooke the next arme of the riuer, which led vs to the Port. But good Signior, one noueltie begets ano∣ther, at our setling our selues, we found that the day before, there was arriued the Archbishop of Rhodes, confined into Aegypt by the Bashaw, euen in a manner vpon the like occasion, as the Deruice Preist was executed about Mecha: yet there was suggested against him the deliuering of certaine prisoners, whom they call by the name of slaues; amongst whom, diuers Knights of Malta so ouercame the priuate re∣gard of himselfe, that in meere commiseration
and some happy remembrance of the place, wherein he liued, he aduentured his owne life for their freedome; all which I learned out of a discourse of his owne, as the Friers brought vs into his presence, and we gaue attention vn∣to his grauitie and orderly relation of his busi∣nes: but before I enter vpon the particulars of his discourse, I must remoue certaine blocks of contradiction, and make my way cleare from absurditie, and that rough manner of dis∣puting by Questions, according to a prouerbe, that a foole may aske a Question, that all the wise men in the world cannot resolue. 1. First then you must know, that al∣though the Turke haue conquered Greece, and some parts of Hungarie, yet he admitteth the toleration of any religion, so that they contri∣bute his customes, and acknowledge his supe∣rioritie, he is contented to leaue them to their owne establishments; so that the Greeke Church doe publikely maintaine their ceremo∣nies, and the Roman Catholicks haue by them∣selues a Church by the name of Francks, euen in Constantinople, or if you will, in the Vines of Pera, or Galata, chuse you whether: yea when the couetous Patriarcke of Constantinople would
haue farmed his place to the Iewes, the Viceer did not permit the same, but by way of punish∣ment, confinde him to Zio, from whence with a beliall spirit, he in a monstrous contumacie went to Mosko, and about the yeare 1588. re∣signed that title to the Archbishop there, & for 100000. peeces of gold, invested him with the absolute Primacie of the Patriarck of the Greek Church: but see the iust iudgment of God, ere he had passed quite through Moldauia, certaine Ianisaries set vpon him, and not onely tooke away his gold, but bereaued him of his life. 2. Secondly, you must consider, that a∣mong the Turkes in taking of prisoners, they haue no distinction of persons, but in their ransome accounting all slaues, and confining them to the Gallies with an ignominious robe, shauing them, and marking them on some parts of their flesh. 3. Thirdly, that this famous towne, and harbour, and Iland of Rhodes was remarkable for two things. 1. First, for a Colossus of brasse, which boasted of great antiquitie, and was in∣deed a man in absolute proportion stradling ouer the hauen, betweene whose legs, a ship with full sailes, top and top gallant, might en∣ter,
so that when the Turke surprised this place, he laded 1500 Camels with the rubbish of this one monument, whereby most of his great Ordinance were cast, which be now in the Tapinare, the office of his Artillerie; and whereas you shall read that S. Paul writ to the Colossians, it was no other then the inhabitants of Rhodes. 2. Secondly, that after the Knights Templars were dissolued, there arose a new or∣der to supply that place, called S. Iohns of Ierusa∣lem, who when the Turks conquered Siria and Palestina, were of so great reuenew in Europe, that for many yeares, they both expulsed the Saracens, and held wars with these new Ma∣humetanes: till at last the high decider of controuersies submitted them to alteration, and both their Monasterie and their Palace were pulled in peeces, by those barbarous hands, that neither spared Ierusalem, nor the wonderment of the world, the Temple of Dia∣na in Ephesus, falsified by some stories vpon Herostratus, who to perpetuate to himselfe a name of villanie, set it on fire. 4. Last of all, that howeuer the Alchoran position, of not disputing of their religion, sealed vp as it were the lauishnes of mens tongues from going at
large, yet will they heare strangers in ciuill op∣position, and euen the strictest arguments, that may conculcate and beat downe their new in∣uentions: but this seldome happens, because either they learning none but the Persian or Syriack language, few men vnderstanding theirs, can dispute with them. But now to the Archbishop. After the Friers had ouerpassed the ceremo∣nies of gratification, & amplified the discourse of there trauell with the circumstances of the vision, the Archbishop replied: your newes hath no way got any hand of my admiration. For it hath beene long since frequent amongst vs, and vpon another report of the troubles in Europe, especially that it rained a whole day bloud into Tiber, and that three sunns were seene in full radiance ouer the citie of Rome, ma∣ny Greeke preests resorted vnto me to Rhodes with an impressed cheerefulnesse, as if our Church were already re-established in the first forme of the primitiue patterne: nor passed it thus amongst our selues; but the Bashaw sent for me in all hast, and not only demanded my opinion of these things, but made meanes to certaine doctors of their law to enter into fur∣ther
disputation with me, I told them plainely, that the originall of Mahomet was a meere de∣uise, which they might easily perceiue by the assotiation of Sergius one of our moncks. For if he had beene a Prophet of God, he would que∣stionlesse neuer haue intermingled any deui∣ses of man: then againe for his prefixed time of returning, it was a thing neuer heard nor red of, that any one returned from the dead, nor shall euer rise, till the last dissolution, and there∣fore how much are you beholding to that God which you doe now worship, that hath from heauen discouered vnto you in a vision what you must trust vnto in these latter times, & if you be not stupified with obstinacy, & remain more stony hearted then euer the Iewes were, that crucified the Sauiour of the world, now are glad tidings brought vnto you: For the wo∣man, which appeared is questionlesse the Church of God compassed about with a Sunne, representing the sonne of righteousnesse, euen Christ the Sauiour of mankind, without whom no flesh can come to happinesse; the booke in her hand is questionlesse the scriptures, and the opening of it, prefigureth the searching and contemplation of the secrets: but whereas so
great an army stil fled, as she opened the booke, how can any thing be personated by it, but that both Persians, Moores, and your selues, will be ashamed and abashed to conceiue in what a sottish ignorance and senceless blindnesse, you haue beene so many yeares detained, therefore embrace the truth, and returne to Christianity, which will bring you into the direct path of saluation, and in the end the glorious king∣dome of heauen. Why replied one of the Doc∣tors, Iewish Doctors. how can this be? your prophet was but a man, as ours was, and for inuentions of men your religion exceeds, and farre exceedes those fanaticall impositions, as you terme them that euer Mahomet gaue vs. But among all as the Iewes haue often told you, there be three or foure such strange things in your religion, that it is impossible for an ho∣nest resolution to apprehend, that God would be serued so foppishly, and childishly: First the erecting of Images: did God cast away the Iewes, & as I haue heard, cursed Ieroboams calues, yea rent the kingdome from your great Salo∣mon, and all because he gaue way to the Idols of his wiues, and will you hauē vs be so entangled againe, as to heap vp vengeance for so foule
an absurdidie on our owne heads? Beleeue it, it will neuer be and it is impossible. 2. Secondly your prophanation of the Sab∣both. Doe we or the Iewes buy and sell as you doe? labour and trauell, eat and gurmandize, gamboll and play, dance, and sing and com∣mit such abuses on that day, as if all the weeke were tied into one bundell, and then set open to florish her expences. 3. Thirdly your dispensations with sinne and selling of indulgences for mony: O God! is God a receiuer of money? or what conceit haue you to thinke, that he that is all loue and mercy, will be corrupted with reward, or brought about with mercenary bribes? 4. Last of all your sumptuous liues, and ex∣cesse of vanity, wherein your Cardinals goe be∣yond greater princes, and shame indeede their profession with vnsanctified superfluitie: I name no more because, I know these be vn an∣swerable and not capable of the distinction of personall falts. With that I replied, although these might be all well excused with circumstantiall infirmi∣ties, and apologicall inferences, that the maine points of saluations are held amongst them,
yet you know, we haue opposed Rome in these things, and not only returned the pride of their supremacy vpon their heads, but discouered their tirannous vsurpation of our rights. For Christianity began in Antioche and the Greekes were the first receiuers of the truth, long before the Latines, therefore belieue it without fur∣ther disputing, vnless we had time to ouer look Ptolemeis library of 200000. bookes, both Rome shall be disrobed, Antichrist discouered, & the riuer of Tiber flow with bloud, as this the rayning of bloud prefigureth, and Mahometh himselfe proued an impostor, so that both Iewes and Turks doe what you can, and say what you list, shall be taken into our fold, and set downe in the accounts of Gods sheepe, and the Christi∣an flock of Christ. When I had made an end of my speech, I protest I cannot tell; whether I left them to the extremity of rage or laughter: For they were so farr from approouing my words, that they cri∣ed out it was pitty such a fellow should liue, & so the Bashaw to shew himselfe a true maintai∣ner of the Othoman glory, committed me to pri∣son, where I remained, vntill such time as their came a new enforcement against me, for hid∣ing
out of the way certaine knights of Malta, slaues, and taken by their gallies in a florentine ship as supposed to ioyne with the pyrates, that had proiected the surprising of Scanderon: but the Bashaw willing to saue my life, as much af∣fecting these gray haires, my former demea∣nor, and that outward proportion I carry, ship∣ped me from Rhodes to Alex: and hath confined me an exile to Aegipt, with licence to liue in Cayro as I list. Hence arose a new contention betweene the Friers and himselfe, about the Popes suprema∣cie, & the augmentation of the Clergies pow∣er from the donation of Princes, and the suffra∣ges of generall Councels, but the Archbishop quickly cut them of, and told them plainely, that the Italian Bishop was but an vsurper, and he made no doubt but the raining of bloud in∣to Tyber prefigured the destruction of Rome, & the shining of the Sunns an hereafter mani∣festation of greater truth: For fellowes, saith he, you know, that our Iohn, Patriarch of Constantino∣ple beganne these tumors of ambition, against whom your Bishop of Rome, called the Great Gregorie opposed, assuring him that any assump∣tion of such an vniuersal title was antichristian
but what followed: the destruction of Phocas and Mauritius the Emperors of the East, and the horrible combination of Bonifacius in the West, which your Bishops can relate, as for your Arrian faction; what a wonder was shown in the world, when our poore Athanasius for op∣posing 700. Bishops, was condemned for an Heretick, had not our blessed Emperor inter∣dicted the sentence, and sauing him, by a vision sent for him to priuate conference, wherein the spirit made him so great a workmaster, that he confirmed the Emperor in his faith, and made that Creed, which is so famous, for the con∣uersion of Europe: as for your Images, who knowes not, that the Councells of Nice, and Constance were contradictory about it, and at last a sentence preuailed for their ouerthrow, and so could I proceed to the ouerthrow of the rest, but that I will haue no further wrangling, therefore hast you into Italie and mark but the reuolution of times, and what I by way of pre∣diction haue spoken: For on my soule both Iewes and Turks shall turne to Christianitie, and Rome your babilonish Rome, shall beset on fire, to the terror of all the world, that haue wished well to the great strumpet, who hath
made the Kings of the earth drunke with the cup of her abomination. With this the com∣pany deuided themselues. The Arch-Bishop prepared for Cayro: the Friers and the rest for Florence, and I setled awhile in Alexandria, from whence hauing so conuenient a messenger I thought it my dutie to acquaint you with these occurrences, wherein if I haue somewhat ex∣tended the limits of a letter, I craue your par∣don and hope you will conceiue, that my good will ouercame discretion; and so I commit my selfe to your care for my dispach, and in all hu∣militie.

❧ The Translators Epilogue. WHat I haue done, you now both see & read. For it cannot be recalled, nor do I meane to make any apology, though it be but like a spiders cobweb, fit for nothing but sweeping away, least I proue like the cour∣tier, that leaped reasonable well vpon the sud∣daine taking him in his bootes, but when he thought to put them of, and make apparent his further dexterity and strength, he came far short, and thus you shall read of Protogenes pencell, that hauing made an arteficiall dogge and comming to finish it, with the muzsled haire about his chaps, he still misliked it, and wiped it away, till at last casting his pencell from him in a rage, he effected that by chance, which all his art was defectiue in: For applica∣tion I haue now done a thing as we say, ex im∣prouiso, not caring to what vse the reader puts it to, so I haue my owne ends: yet as I heare, it will be likt, whether I will or no, and is meerely a tricke of blind fortune to out-face both good endeauours, and true scholership: For let me neuer be trusted, if euer so hood-winckt a
bayard aduentured before on so hard a stile, and durst publish it as a worke, either wor∣thy the viewing, or censuring. The obsti∣nate Papist will storme, and the pedanticall humorist will sweare, if not sweat: the censorious traueller will smile, the nouelist will buy it, though it were a lye; and he that liues by an Almanack will suppose, there may be something in it for direction; the yong man may affect it, being himselfe not solid enough for a Critick; and some old men may be yong enough to entertaine it: The free-hearted Gen∣tleman will say, it was well done to affright idlenes with some endeuors; and the man of grauitie and learning will conclude it a deuise to get money. To get money; what as this world goes? In the name of Couetousnes, who would care for money? when euery mans dores are open to the hungry belly, euery na∣ked soule clothed, euery empty purse filled, nay a man cannot looke sadly, but his friend will aske him, what he ayleth; and if want be the cause, send him a gratuitie the next morning; when our yong Ladies will leaue off their tiers, painting, and fethers to bestow it on poore Schollers, and a man shall no sooner character
a booke with a Moecenas, but the Lord will send all ouer the towne to looke him out, and not trouble him to waite vpon him: when the mo∣ney shall be spared, that was wont to be spent vpon Barbers, panders, and whores, and equal∣ly diuided amongst men of well-deseruing. In a word, when olde acquaintance will stay his Caroch in the streets to speake to his decayed frend; and when he comes home to negotiate with him, will send for him vp without excu∣ses, though he be in bed with his Lady. Not∣withstanding all this, considering my disa∣strous improuidence, and dogged humor to snarle at the basenes of men indeed; I was glad it got money: For if the worst fall; I shall be able while it last to pay for my dinner, and preuent the cutting my throat, in expecting to be sent for else-where: yet good Reader, in way of ciuilitie, I would it could get you some∣what too; that is, if you cannot beleeue it as truth, yet to make that vse of it, as if it were true; and then shall you know, there is but one way to happines, and all the praedictions, pro∣phesies, visions, apparitions, Comets, invnda∣tions, stormes, tempests, famine, warre, altera∣tion,
and subuersion of Kingdomes, with all the cabinet of of mysteries, tend to this end, that proemium and poena be the mastring curbs of the world: that is, that God hath a Magazin of iudg∣ments to inflict on the obstinate sinner with punishments; and a store-house of mercy to support the penitent soule with comfort. FINIS.
