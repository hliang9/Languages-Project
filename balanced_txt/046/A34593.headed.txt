A DISCOVERSE OF The life of the most Il∣lustrious PRINCE HENRY late PRINCE of Wales. IN this most Illustrious PRINCE, may most cleerlybee discerned, that Gods judgements are onely knowne to himselfe, and his thoughts and determi∣nations unsearchable: For having so framed and fashioned him, as his most rare parts in youth gave so ma∣ny presages of his becomming to his divine Majesty, (from whom he received them) an honour and glory, to the world a won∣der, and to the people of these Kingdomes
an exceeding happinesse; yet was hee plea∣sed in the spring of his yeares, and of the hope had of him, to take him to himself, and to deprive the world of him, neither could of his short life (so farre as the eyes of man could discerne) the reasons grow either out of neglect, or want of performance of du∣ties to God, or of obedience to his Parents, the observance of which Commandement, onely hath the enlarging of time upon this earth annexed unto it: for in the first, it cannot bee denyed but hee was ex∣ceedingly observant, never failing to sacrifice unto God the first of his acti∣ons, to continue in them with all demon∣stration of reverence, without any diversion or distraction; to cherish such as in whom he found ability to teach, and piety to ex∣presse in life the fruits of their doctrine, to resolve so far to become immutable in the Religion hee professed, as long before his end with solemne protestations, he vowed that he would never joine in marriage with a wife of a different faith, & had besides a de∣termination (if longer he had lived) to have made choice of a Chapleine of his owne, a man in yeares, grave in Divinity, rare∣ly learned, and of great discretion, ex∣perience
and wisdome, by whose ad∣vice in all matters, spirituall and tending to the rectifying of his Soule, hee in∣tended to have received a continuall di∣rection. Of the second, to speake not by heresay, but of mine owne knowledge (howsoever some moaths and mice of Court in that time, not enemies to him in particular) but maligners of true vertue, and only friends to their own ambitions and desires, to possesse the eares & opinions of Princes, had in that particular traduced him: So true and sincere he was both in profession, and execution of all duties and obedience, and bare so natu∣rall and filiall a reverence and respect to the King his Father, as although sometimes out of his owne inclination, or the incitation and encouragement of others, hee repaired to the Court and moved the King in some things, either concerning the Common∣wealth, his own particular interest, or that of others; yet with the least word, coun∣tenance or signe given him of his Majesties disallowance, hee would instantly desist from further pursuite of it, and returne ei∣ther with satisfaction in regard that hee un∣derstood
it to be disagreeing with his Ma∣jesties pleasures, or with such a resolved patience, as he neither in word nor worke gave so much as any semblance of being displeased or discontented: Nay, which is more, sotruly was hee affected to the plea∣sing and satisfying of the King his Father in all things, as some good time before his death, hee made unto my selfe a solemne protestation, that to the end he might not in any thing ee either displeasing or give the least distaste unto his Majesty, hee would from thenceforth utterly remove his thoughts from all affaires whatsoever, that should not particularly concerne himselfe, his owne estate, or the government of his houshold. In this discourse of that memorable Prince, I will for beare to speake of his in∣fancy or youngest yeares, (although I have heard by such as did then attend him) the same did most presage his ensuing ver∣tues. My purpose and desire is to deliver to hing but verities knowne to my selfe, not things received by tradition from o∣thers.
In the first spring of his yeare of under∣standing, the King his father committed un∣to him the disposing of the Lands and Re∣venues assigned to him, and the government of his houshold; for the administration whereof, his Majesty appointed unto him certaine especiall Officers; in the number of whom (my selfe being not long before re∣turned out of Spaine, where I served the King divers yeares as his Ambassadour) was constituted Treasurer of his house. The place gave me occasion continually to attend him, and the especiall favour that I after found with him, not onely meanes to observe his actions, but to become par∣ticularly acquainted with the most of his thoughts. My first step into his favour and especiall trust, grew out of that which with some o∣ther Princes would have cast mee downe either into perpetuall disgrace, or at least into a temporary distaste and dislike, hard∣ly recoverable; I so much admired his ju∣dicious parts in so unripe an age, and dis∣cerned in him so great a will to know, and
so Noble and rare a disposition to give eare to advertisements, as out of the duty of my place, and extraordinary affection to him∣selfe, taking hold of some fit occasion and opportunity, I adventured to make proofe whether he would endure advice or adver∣tisement reprehensive. Young Princes left to their owne wills, and great men that are set upon the highest stage of worldly greatnesse, and lulled in the lap of fortune, doe rarely endure a re∣proving voice, especially from those of a lower forme. I take the occasion from a then generall supposall, or at least, suspition of a little too much streightnesse of his hand in rewar∣ding and of some errors in his actions, but did so tenderly tread upon those grounds, and with so retiring a foote, as occasioned a discovery from himselfe of desire to re∣ceive and have a full sight of them, before I pulled off the maske wherewith I had covered them. In conclusion, I delivered them in substance plainly, but in words soft and respective,
(as to such a Prince became me) Kings and Princes being to bee treated with, with words of silke not of iron. To the first, he gave answers satisfactorily. To the other, excusively. But what were the fruits succeeding to his ever enduring honour, Truth enforceth me to publish, that I ever after in mine own particular, found my selfe exceedingly en∣greated in his favour, and that those few things that were erred became reformed. To this so rare a disposition, which being by a Prince entertained, cannot but make him both scient of the Offices appertaining to his high estate, and in time also, as good as great, which in one borne to go∣verne, of all things is the most desireable, is to be added another vertue in one of Re∣gall power, as valuble, and not much lesse necessary: So very close hee was and faith∣full a keeper of whatsoever secret was dis∣closed unto him, as it was never knowne to any, that ever hee discovered any one word in that kinde delivered unto him.
Apt he was to heare and desirous to re∣ceive advertisements and advises, by any in whom he descerned knowledge gained by learning, or abilities wonne out of time, and experience to give them, neither did he take them in Transitu: As in the old Testa∣ment they celebrated the Passeover, nor as a man receiveth his cloake to put about him, not within him; but gave both time to the deliverers to relate them, and lea∣sure to himselfe to consider and digest them. Counsells are to be chewed not swallow∣ed, he would therefore unrip every seame of them by interrogations used by himself, and receive reasons and resolutions by those that offered them, untill by mature debate and consultation, (which are the true foiles that give cleernesse and assurednesse to counsells) he had both perfected and made them sollid and fit for his use whensoever occasion should be offered. In the government of his houshold in yeares so very young, hee gave examples imitable to all other Princes.
His family was ample, as that which consisted of few lesse then five hundred, many of them young Gentlemen, borne to great fortunes, in the prime of their years when their passions and appetites were most strong, and their powers and experiences to temper and subject them to reason most weake, his judgement, his grave and Princely aspect, gave temper to them all, his very eye served for a commandement, and more and better service have I noted to be done by the very lookes of him, then by sharpe reprehensions of some other Prin∣ces: If any questions or quarrells were mo∣ved amongst his servants, he would give a stoppe and stay to them, at the very begin∣ning by referring them to some such of his principall Officers, as hee thought to bee most scient in matters of that nature, and best did know to give just compensation to the inured, and reproofe to them that should be found to have offered the wrong; so as in so numerous a family there was not so much as any blows given, or any counte∣nance of quarrell or debate betweene any.
Plenty and magnificence were the things that in his house he especially affected, but not without such a temper as might agree with the rules of frugality and moderation; he caused to bee set downe in writing unto him the several heads of al his annuall char∣ges, the ordinary expence of his house and his stables, the charge of his apparrell and wardrobe, his rewards and all such o∣ther thinges, as yearly were to bee issued out of his coffers, and comparing them with his annuall revenue, did so judiciously fashion and proportion them by shortning what he found superfluous, and encreasing what was wanting and too short in any of them, as hee reduced them to a certainty, and such as his revenues would well de∣fray, besides a yearly spare of some thou∣sands of pounds which hee reserved for a store or treasure to be ready for all events and occasions accidentall. By giving of which so good and solid foundation and order unto his state, hee delivered himself from all necessity of be∣comming rigid or strait to his Tenants, ei∣ther by any unmeasurable improving their
Farmes or their Fines, or seeking or ta∣king advantage of any their forfeitures, and became also unnecessited to take the benefit that both law and right afforded unto him, of such as had in time of former Princes purchased lands appertaining to his Dutchy of Cornewall, which could not by Law be alienated from the same, to whom out of his Princely bounty and gracious compassion, upon resuming of them, hee gave some reasonable satisfaction. The banquets and feasts that any time he made, his desire was, should be magnifi∣cient and agreeing with his Princely digni∣ty, yet not without an especiall eye and care had that nothing should bee spent in disorder, or the charge made greater through the want of providence, or well managing by his officers; in those hee ever affected the demonstration of a Princely greatnesse, and that all things should passe with decency and decorum, and without all rudenesse, noise or disorder. In any thing either committed or per∣mitted unto him by the King his Father, concerning the State and defence of the
Kingdome, exceeding willing, sedulous and carefull hee ever shewed himselfe, to performe all offices and duties understan∣dingly, and with much circumspection. His Highnesse during his a∣bode in that place, lay at Mr. Legats house, then Clarke of the Chequer. He was once sent by his Majesty to take view of the Navy at Chatham, whither my selfe waited upon him and observed how great his desire was not onely to see with his owne eyes every particular Ship, but to inable himselfe by conference and consultation with the best experienced of his Majesties Officers of the Navy, in the fashion and fabricature of the Ships, to un∣derstand their strengths and the forme of their sailing, to take knowledge of such as were then perfited and fitted for present service, and which defective, and in what several parts, to the end there might instant∣ly be order given for the repairing of them; he also very perticularly enformed himselfe of their severall equipages and furnitures, went in person to take an exact view of them and of his Majesties store for that pur∣pose, and would not bee satisfied without understanding the speciall uses of every of those things, and of all other that tended to make them serviceable and usefull, what
further in yeares more ripe was in Navall affaires, wherein consisted the principall strength, honour and advantage of this Kingdome, to be expected of him, may ea∣sily be discerned by his will, his diligence, his understanding and Princely courage, shewed upon occasion of discourse, delivered unto him by a servant of his own, concerning a Navall warre with Spaine, whensoever that King shall give cause of a publicke hostility. To publish particulars agrees not with the rules of State, but two especiall thinges being propounded, which were the prepa∣ration of a Navy, consisting of a certaine number of Ships to bee sent into the West Indies, and another to attend the coasts of Spaine to prohibit all entry or issue of Ships either into or out of the same. Admirable it was in one of yeares so young, to heare what interrogations he used of every particularity of that designe, of the feisiblenesse and of the difficulties of every branch of it, how hee insisted upon every doubt, untill by the best experienced & practised both in Sea services & in Navi∣gation,
with reasons and demonstrations he became fully satisfied, & that done, how nar∣rowly & neerly he searched into every knot, both of the honour and utility, and of the danger & charge that an attempt of that na∣ture would draw with it, & ceased not untill he understood every particular of the same, and especially the yeerly charge which that whole expedition would amount unto; which having found so very reasonable, and the hopes so great, and all doubts so well resolved, to shew the valour of his owne heart, hee openly protested to such as were present, that should the King his Father bee pleased upon any future occasion to breake with Spaine, himselfe (if so it should agree with his Majesties pleasure) would in person become the executor of that Noble attempt for the West Indies. In persons private it may suffice to bee Religious, honest and just within them∣selves. To Princes and men constituted in high places, it behoveth to bee also givers of good example to others.
Inferiours and Subjects cast their eyes more upon what Princes doe, then upon what they command, their examples with them are of more force then any Law of letters. This became to this Prince so great a motive, as hee thought not fit to lose any houres of the life that upon this earth were appointed unto him, but so to bestow them, as they might not onely become profi∣table to himselfe, but imitable and ex∣emplary to others He so distributed the day by dividing his houres into the service of God, to the apting himselfe to the office hee was borne unto, both in government Civill and Mili∣tary, and to necessary exercises and recrea∣tions, as no part of it could bee said to bee in vaine bestowed; to inable his know∣ledge in government civill, he read Histo∣ries, the knowledge of things passed con∣ducing much to resolution in things pre∣seat, and to prevention of those to come.
In the military, hee added thereunto the Mathematicks study of Cosmography, and had one that instructed him in the matter and forme of fortifications. For practice, hee used in a manner dai∣ly to ride and manage great horses, with which hee had his stables most excellently furnished, oftimes to runne at the Ring and sometimes at Tilt, both which he so well and dexterously performed, and with so great a comelinesse, as in those his first yeares, he became second to no Prince in Christendome, and to many that practised with him much superiour. His other exercises were dancing, lea∣ping, and in times of yeare fit for it learning to swimme, at sometimes walking fast and farre, to accustome and enable himselfe to make a long march when time should re∣quire it; but most of all at Tennis play, wherein, to speake the truth, which in all things I especially affect, hee neither obser∣ved moderation, nor what appertained to his dignity and person, continuing oftimes his play for the space of three or foure
houres, and the same in his shirt, rather be∣comming an Artisan then a Prince, who in things of that nature are onely to affect comelinesse, or rather a kinde of carelesse∣nesse in shew, to make their activities seeme the more naturall, then a laborious and toiling industry. Of this and of his diet, wherein he shew∣ed too much inclination to excessive eating of fruits, he was as in al other things content to heare advice, but in these two particulars not to follow it. To other play or gaming, hee shewed himself not much inclined, yet would some∣times play at Obesse at Biliors and at Cards, but so very Nobly and like himselfe, as plainly shewed his use of it to bee onely for recreation, not for appetite of gaine; for whether he wonne or lost, his countenance was ever the same, and for the most part, greater appearance of mirth in him when he was in losse, then when hee wonne, thereby plainly demonstrating both his judgement in adventuring no more then what he made no regard of if he lost it: and his Princely magnanimity and temper in
suffering no passion or alteration to take hold of him through any crossenesse of Cards or chance. In some young Gentlemen whom he af∣fected, he seemed to mislike too much dis∣position to play, and did not onely disad∣vise them from it, but gave unto some of them matter of value to become bound to leave the use of it; for pleasure hee tooke them all as it were in passage without sem∣blance, either to desire them, or at least to have a will to dwell in them. The pleasure of the flesh, especially which is most incident to young yeares, and by Princes rarely avoidable, whose fancies and affections, are commonly as vehement as their persons and powers are great; and therefore most like to fall themselves, and give occasion of falling to others, although some in those times, there were that taking measure of him by the yard wand of their owne unbridled appetities, were pleased o∣therwise to conceive and report of him, yet my selfe having beene present at great feasts made in his house, whereunto hee invited the most beautifull and specious Ladies of
the Court and City, could neither then dis∣cover by his behaviour, his eies or his coun∣tenance, any shew of singular or especiall fancy to any, or at any other time such loosenesse either in words or action, as whereupon in justice or reason to ground any such opinion of him. But rather thus with truth and assured∣nesse to determine, that were he not himself chaste in his inward thoughts, yet did hee with so incomparable judgement and tem∣per cover them, as to just and judicious eies they gave no true occasion to suspect him. It is true, that to take a wife though hee shewed no vehement desire, yet he demon∣strated a good inclination. Marriages were propounded and offered for him in Spaine, in the time that my selfe there served, who had from the King his Father commission to treate it, but finding that the overture there, grew rather out of a desire to winne time to advance their owne designes, then with true intention to per∣forme it, in regard of the difference of Re∣ligion, I for my part gave end to that
negotiation in a manner so soone as I be∣gan it. After my returne from thence and entry into his Highnesse service, like motions were made both by Florence and Savoy: But those not conforming with what in alliances with Princes of his greatnesse, either in encrease or equality of Honour or Utility, or for strength and surety of estate was especially to be regarded. That of Spaine was upon a new over∣ture, made by the Ambassadour of the King there, againe entertained and com∣mitted by his Majesty here, to be treated of by his Ambassadour, who in that Court succeeded me. But after some protractions used there, it was upon the first opening, found to have come too late, that Princesse for whom the Treaty was intended, being the eldest daughter of that King, and the onely who in yeares was fit for him, being formerly promised to the French King that now is.
Lastly, there grew a proposition for a daughter of France, wherein his Highnesse having as in duty it became him, submitted and reserved himselfe to the King his Fa∣ther, the same was not proceeded in, to any effect. In this Noble Prince was to be observed a singular integrity and cleernesse of thoughts; hee had a true Kingly dispositi∣on, and so farre from being induced to piece up the skinne of the Lion, with that of the Fox, as above all things hee hated flattery and dissimulation. A Noble man in those times, in the highest favour with the King his Father, wrote unto him by the especiall comman∣dement of his Majesty, a letter wherein he recommended unto him a matter of very great consequence to bee instantly answe∣red unto, and in his subscription used these words, Yours before all the world.
This answer his Highnesse committed unto me, who having written it, did also set down some words of favour to the Noble man to precede his Highnesse Signature; the letter it selfe hee read, and having considered it, allowed it wholly without alteration. Onely in regard of the words of subscri∣ption, notwithstanding the great haste that he made of the dispatch, hee commanded me, it should be new written and those left out, and notwithstanding all the reasons that I used to the contrary, would by no meanes bee perswaded to suffer it so to passe, saying, that he to whom he wrote had untruly and unfaithfully dealt with him, and that his hand should never affirme that his heart thought not. This Prince as he was no coverer of his thoughts where he had just cause of dislike, so would he also to those he trusted, hee acknowne of his love to such as hee affe∣cted.
Of the titular Nobility of this Kingdome upon occasion offered, he would expresse himselfe best to love and esteeme such as were most anciently descended, and most nobly and honestly disposed, when some∣times also he would not forbeare by name to particulate. His Highnesse brother our now So∣veraigne then Duke of Yorke, and his sister since that time Queene of Bohemia he entirely loved; yet must I confesse at sometimes by a kinde of rough play and dalliance with the one, and a semblance of contradicting the other, in what he descer∣ned her to desire, he tooke a pleasure in gi∣ving both to the one and the other, some cause in those their so tender yeares to make proofe of their patiences. To say the truth, such were both those excellent Princes, their owne rare parts and most sweet dispositions, as had there beene none other attractive of bloud or nature would to them have enforced his love and best affection.
He gave also in the administration & go∣vernment of his own particular estate, much presage of what hee would have become if he had lived to possesse the Diademe. At such times as hee attended the King his father to houses of remove, or in pro∣gresse, hee would not endure that carriages or provisions, should bee taken for him without full contentment given to the par∣ties. In removes to his owne houses in like manner. Nay so carefull he was that none by him, or any of his traine should bee either preju∣diced or annoyed; as whensoever he went a hawking, before harvest ended, he would take care that none should passe through the corne, and to give them example, would himselfe ride rather a furlong about, truly and judiciously conceiving that to Prin∣ces there is no surer fortresse then that of hearts, and that those once had and setled, the rest of what they possesse is at their commandment.
Of his disposition to justice, hee gave al∣so upon all occasions much proofe and de∣monstration. Hee would never either condemne or censure any man unheard or undefended, retaining in his memory that notable ex∣ample given to Princes by God himselfe, whose divine knowledge both of workes and thoughts, needing no informers; yet after Adams fall, would neither censure him nor his Eve without hearing what ei∣ther of them could say in their own defence. This I could demonstrate by divers par∣ticulars, as also of his being misericordious after offence acknowledged, should not a long discourse seem unproportionable to so short a life. It is true, that he was of an high minde, and knew well how to keepe his distance, which indeed he did to all, neither admit∣ting a neere or full approach either to his power or his secrets.
Hee oftimes protested that neither fan∣tasie nor flattery should move him to con∣ferre upon any a superlative place in his fa∣vour, but would to the uttermost of his understanding, measure unto all according to the merit of their services, as holding it not just to yeeld unto affections, or rather second respects, that which is onely due to vertue and deservings. That remunerative hee was of services, and considerative of those that deserved and and needed. A most memorable and imitable ex∣ample hee gave before his death, ha∣ving to divers of his servants, who longest had served, and in whom hee noted want, given by severall Patents sent unto them, Pensions during life, to the value of eleven or twelve hundred pounds by yeare, and that without all mediation and intreaty by others, and at a time when themselves did least expect it.
To conclude of this Prince, did hee not all thinges well? The fault is rather to bee imputed to those that in yeares so un∣ripe, by their advice should have assisted him and lined out his wayes, then to any want of will or Religious and Princely disposition in himselfe. He was of a comely personage, of indiffe∣rent stature, well and streight limmed, and strongly proportioned, his countenance and aspect inclining in those his young yeares to gravity and shew of Majesty. His judgement so farre beyond what his age could promise, as it was truly ad∣mirable. His speech slow and somewhat impedi∣mented, rather as I conceive, by custome and a long imitation of some that did first instruct him, then by any defect in nature, as appeared by much amendment of the same.
After that he had beene advised to a more often exercise of it, by using at home a∣mongst his owne servants, first short dis∣courses, and after longer as he should finde himselfe inabled. Yet would he oftimes say of himselfe that he had the most unserviceable tongue of any man living. Towards the latter part of his time, so well became forraine Princes by their Am∣bassadours informed of his rare parts, as the adverse to this Kingdome beganne to feare and redoubt him, and the well affected and confederated to love and entertaine great hopes of him. But God seeing it good to bestow ano∣ther Crowne upon him, excelling all that on earth was to be had or hoped. After some five dayes sicknesse endu∣red with patience, and as often recognition of his faith, his hopes and his appeales to Gods mercy, as his infirmity which affli∣cted
him altogether in his head would pos∣sibly permit. He yeelded up the Ghost at Saint Iames next Westminster, and was interred at Westminster, where his body now re∣steth. I wish it were in my power to raise such a monument unto his fame, as might eternise it unto all posterities. FINIS.
