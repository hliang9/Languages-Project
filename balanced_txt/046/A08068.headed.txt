THE CONFESSION of faith of certayn Eng∣lish people, living in exile, in the Low countreyes. Together with a brief note of the special heads of those things wherin we differ frō the Church of Englād. 2 Cor. 4, 13. We beleev: therefore have we spoken. Harmony of Confess. in the pre∣face set before it, in the Name of the French & Belgick Churches. The Prelates & Priests alway cry out, that we are Hereticks, Schismaticks, and Sectaryes. How∣beit let them know that the crime of Heresy is not to be imputed to them whose faith doth whol∣ly rely vpon most sure grounds of the Scripture; That they are not Schismaticks, who entierly cleave to the true Church of God, such as the Prophets & Apostles do describe vnto vs; Nor they to be coūted Sectaryes, who embrace the truth of God which is one and alwayes like it self. Reprinted in the yeare. 1607.
To the reverend and learned men, Students of holy Scripture, in the Christian Vniversities, of Leyden in Holland, of Sanct∣andrewes in Scotland, of Heidelberg, Ge∣neva, and other the like famous schooles of learning in the Low countreys. Scotland, Germany, & France. The English people exiled, in the Low coū∣treys, wish grace and peace in Iesus Christ. THis true Confession of our fayth, in our iudgment wholly agreable to the sacred Scri∣pture, we here exhibit vnto al to be discussed: and vnto you (reverend Sirs) we dedicate it for two causes. First, for that we know you are able in respect of your singular knowledg in the Scrip∣tures, and hope you are willing in respect of your syncere piety, to convince our errours by the light of Gods word, if any where we erre out of the way. Secondly, that this testimony of Christian faith, if you also fynd it to agree with the word of truth, may by you be approved, eyther in silence or by writing, as you shal think best. It may be, we shal be thought very bold, that being despised of all, yet doubted not to sollicite you so many and so great learned men. But this we did, partly at the request of others to whom we would not deny it; partly with desire
to have the truth through your help more de∣fended & furder spread abroad; partly constrey∣ned by our exile & other calamities almost in∣finite; partly also moved with love of our na∣tive countrey, and of these wherein now we live and others else where; wishing that al may walk with a right foot to the truth of ehe Gsspel, & praying daily vnto God, that the great work of restoring religion & the Church decayed, which he hath happily begun in these latter tymes, by our Gracious Soveraigne and the other Princes of these countreyes & ages (his servants) he would fully accomplish, to the glorie of his name & ternal salvation in Christ of his elect in al places of the earth. Touching the causes which moved vs to pu∣blish this Confession of faith, & to forsake the Church of Eugland as now it standeth, we have truly & as briefly as we could related them, in the Preface to the Reader, hereafter following: & therefore thought here to omit the repetition of them. The Lord Iesus alway pre∣serve you & your Vniversityes to the prayse of his name, the ornament of good learning, th propagation & maintenance of his pure Religion. From Amsterdam in the low countreyes. The yeare of the last patience of the saints, 1598.
❧The preface to the Christian Reader. IT may seem strange vnto thee (Christian Reader) that any of the Englysh nation should for the truth of the Gospell be for∣ced to forsake their native country, & live in exile, especially in these dayes when the Gospel seemeth to have free passage & flo∣rish in that land. And for this cause have our exile ben hardly thought of by many, and evil spoken of by some, who know not (as it seemeth) eyther the trew estate of the Church of England, or causes of our forsa∣king and separation from the same, but hea∣ring this sect (as they call it) to be every where spoken against,Act. 28 2 have (without all fur∣ther search) accounted and divulged vs as heretickes, or Schismatickes at the least. Yea some (and such as worst might) have sought the increase of our afflictions, even here also if they could: which thing they have both secretly and openly attempted. This hath Sathan added vnto all our for∣mer sorrowes, envying that we should have rest in any part of the inhabited world, and therfore ceaseth not to make warre with the remnant of the womans seed,Rev,  which keep the com∣cōmaundements
of, God and the testimony of Iesus Christ.al. 105. , 14. But the Lord that brought his former Israel out of Egypt & when they walked about from nation to nation, from one Kingdome to an other people, suffered no man to do them wrong, but reproved Kinges for their sakes: the same Lord yet liveth to mainteyn the right of his afflicted servantes, whō he hath severed, and dayly gathereth out of the world,Pet. 2, 9. to be vnto himself a chosen genera∣tion, a royal priesthood,Psal. 46, 1 a peculiar people & Isra∣ell of God: He is our hope and strength and help in troubles ready to be found, he will hyde vs vnder his winges, and vnder his feathers we shall be sure, vntill these mise∣ries be overpast. And though we could for our partes wel have borne this rebuke of Christ in silence, aud left our cause to him who iudgeth iust∣ly al the children of men: yet for the ma∣nifestation & clearing of the truth of God from reproches of men, and for the bring∣ing others together with our selves to the same knowledg and fellowship off the Gos∣pel, we have thought it needfull & our duty to make knowen vnto the world, our vn∣feyned fayth in God, and loyall obedience towards our Prince and all Governers set over vs in the Lord, together with the reasons of our leaving the Ministery worship and Church of England. Which are not (as they pretend) for some few faultes & cor∣corruptions
remayning, such as we acknow∣ledg may be found in the perfectest Church on earth: Neyther count wee it lawfull for any member to forsake the fellowship off the Church for blemishes and imper∣fections, which every one according to his calling should studiously seek to cure, and to exspect and further it, vntill eyther there follow redresse or the disease be gro∣we incureable,Rev. 2. 5. & the candlestick be moved out of the place. But we having through Gods mercy learned to discerne betwixr2 Cor. 6. 1. ▪ 15. &c Psa. 94. 20. the true worship of God & the Antichristiā lei∣tourgy; the true ministery of Christ & An∣tichristiā prelacy;2 Thes. 2. 3. the ordināces of Christs testament & Popish canons: have also lear∣ned to leavePs. 37. 2▪ Ier. 51. 6. the evill & choose the good, to forsake Babell the land of our captivitie, & get vs vnto Sion the mount of the Lordes ho∣lynes,Rev. 18. 4. & 14. 1. and place where his honour dwelleth. But first we desire thee, good Reader, to vnderstand, and mynd that we have not in any dislyke of the Civill estate and po∣litick government in that Common wealth, which we much like and love, separated our selves from that Church: Neyther have we shaken of our alleageance and dutifull obedyence to our Soveraigne PRINCE, the honorable Counsellers, and other Magistrates set over vs, but have alwayes and still do reverēce love and obey them every one in the Lord, opposing our selves
against all enemyes forreigne or domesti∣cal: against all invasions, insurrections, trea∣sons or conspiracies by whomsoever inten∣ded against the Prince and the State, and are ready to adventure our lives in their de∣fence, if need require. Neither have our greatest adversaryes ever ben able to at∣taint vs of the least disloyalty in this regard. And though now we be exiled, yet do we dayly pray & wil for the preservation peace & prosperity of our Soveraigne Prince & al the dominions of that kingdome. And whereas we have been accused of intrusion into the Magistrates office, as going about our selves to reforme the abuses in that land, it is a mere malicious calumnie, which our adversaries have forged out of their own hart.Neh. 6. 6. 7. . We have alwayes both by word & practise shewed the contrary, ney∣ther ever attempted or purposed any such thing: but have endevored thus only to re∣forme our selves and our lives according to the rule of Gods word, by absteyning from al evill & keeping the cōmandements of Iesus: leaving the suppressing and cast∣ing out of those remnants of Idolatry, vnto the Magistrates, to whom it belongeth. And further we testify by these presents vnto all men, & desyre them to take know∣ledg heerof, that we have not forsaken any poynt of the true Ancient Catholicke and Apostolike fayth professed in our land: but
hold the same groundes of Christian religi∣on with them stil, agreeing lykewise here∣in, with the Dutch,Harmon. of Confes. Scottish, Germane, French, Helvetian, and al other Christian reformed Churches round about vs, whose Confessions published, we cal to witnes our agreement with them, in matters of greatest moment, being conferred with these Articles of our sayth following. The thinges then onely a∣gainst which we contend, & which we mis∣like in the Eglish parish assemblies, are ma∣ny reliqus of that mn of synne (whom they pretend to have abandoned) yet re∣teyned among them, and with a high hand maynteyned, vpholden, and imposed. The particulers whereof (being almost infinite) cannot wel of vs be set down, and would be tedious and yrksome to thee (good Rea∣der:) But the principal heads we wil truely relate, and that o briefly as in so large and confuse a subject we can. First, in the planting and constituting of their Church (at the beginning of Queen Elizabets reigne) they receyved at once into the body of that Church, as mēbers, the whole land, which generally then stood for the most part professed Papists, who had revolted from the profession, which they made in the dayes of King Edward of happy memory, and shed much blood of many Christian Martyrs in Queen Maryes dayes. This people yet standing in this
fearful sinful state, in Idolatry, blyndnes, su∣perstition, and all manner wickednes, with∣out any professed repentance, and without the meanes thereof, namely the preaching of the word going before, were by force & authority of Law only compelled, and to∣gether received into the bosome and body of the Church, their seed baptised, them∣selves receved and compelled to the Lords supper, had this ministery and service (which now they vse) inioyned & set over thē, and ever synce they and their seed re∣mayne in this estate, being all but one bo∣dy commonly called the Church of England. Here are none exempted or excluded, be they never so prophane or wretched, no A∣theist, adulterer, thief, or murderer, no ly∣er, perjurer, Witch or conjurer, &c▪ al are one fellowship, one body, one Church. Now let the law of God be looked into, and there wilbe found, that such persons1 Pet. 2. 5. Ier. 51. 26. are not fit stones for the Lords spiritual howse, no meet members for Christs glorious bo∣dy. None of yearesAct. 2. 38. 40. 41. and 8. 36. 37. & 15 9. Ioh 10. 3. 4 5. Esa. 35. 8. 9. may be received in∣to the Church without fre professed fayth repentance and submission vnto the Gospel of Christ & his heavenly ordinances. Ney∣ther mayIoh. 15. 2. 5. Mat. 18. 15. 17 Lev. 13. 46. Num. 4. 13. any contynew there longer then they bring forth the fruyts of fayth, walk∣ing as becommeth the Gospell of Christ. Christ IesusIohn. 15. 19. & 17. 14. 16 Mat. 3. 12. Lev. 20. 24. 6. 1 Iohn. 4. 5. 6. hath called & severed his ser∣vants out of and from the world. How
then should this confused and mixed peo∣ple be esteemed the orderly gathered true planted and right constituted Church of God? Secondly, as they have reteyned the whole rout of the popish multitude without any distinctiō, for mēbers of their Church▪ so have they set over them (as reason was) the same popish Clergie & Prelacy, which they receved from the Romish Apostasie, and this day is to be found in the popish Churches:About forty ecclesiasticall popish offices are at this day in the Church of England, ne∣ver a one ap∣pointed by Christ in his Testament. to witt, Archbs, Primates, Bbs. Metropolitanes, Suffraganes, Archdeacōs, Deanes, Chauncellors, Commissaries, and the rest of that rable, which rule and govern these as∣semblyes according to the Popish Canons, Rites, and Customes. These have the power and aucthoritie in their hands to set forth Injunctions, to make and depose Ministers, to excommunicate both Priests and people, which they do very exquisitly, if they yeeld not vnto them their due homage and obe∣dience. These have both Ecclesiastical and Civil aucthoritie, to reigne as Princes in the Church and live as Lords in the Common wealth, to punish, imprison, and persecute even to death al that dare but once mutter against their vnlawfull proceedings. Of these Prelates tyranny cruelty & vnlawful aucthoritie, the better sort both of prea∣chers and people have cryed out, and long tyme sued vnto the Prince and Parlament
to have them removed out of the Church as beig the lymmes of Antichrist. But not prevayling. they are now content (fo avoyding of the crosse of Christ) to submit themselves & their soules to this Antichristian Hierarchie, and beare the sinful yok and burthen of their traditions, and to receive and carry about the dreadful and dtestable marke of the Beast vpon them. Thirdly, the inferiour ministery of tha Church, consisteth of Priests, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, hired preachers or Lecturers, with Clerks and other like Officers, which have received their offices callings and aucthoritie from their forenamed Lords the Prelates to whom they sweare their canonical obedi∣ence, and promise to performe it with al reverence and submission. Their office i to read over the service book & Bbs Decrees thereby to worship God,With what words and rites, in what habit and ges∣ture, these things are to be done, they are taught in their Rubrik. to marry, to bury, to church women, to visit the sick, give him the Sacrament, and forgive him al his sinnes: & if their livings or benefices (as they are called) amount to a certeine sūme of money in the Princes booke, then must they preach, or get some other to preach for them fower sermons in a yeare in their parish. Where also must be noted that the most part of these Priests are vt∣terly vnlearned, and cannot preach at all: whereby it commeth to passe that most of the people are as blynd as they were in the
dark dayes of popery. These Ministers generally, aswel preachers as other, live in feare & servitude vnder their foresaid Lords the Bbs. For as without their licence writ∣ten and sealed they cannot preach, so vp∣on their displeasure and for not obeying their injunctions, they are many tymes sus∣pended, degraded, and if they will not be ruled, put in prison: so that sundry of thē have ben suspended and imprisoned for preaching against the Prelats, not subscri∣bing to their devised Articles and Booke of cō∣mon prayer, not wearing the sqare cap and surplice, not reading the service booke, & be tyed to the same, not coming to the Bbs courts, visitations, inquisitions, &c. tyll now of late being wearyed with these trou∣bles, they give place to their tyranny, and are content to conforme themselves, and yeeld their canonical obedience according to their oath, eeping now silence, yea going back, bearing & bolstering the things which heretofore by word and wryting they stood against, so long as there was any hope that the Prince & Counsel would have heakened vnto them, and put these adversary Prelats out of the Church. Fourthly, for administratiō, which is by Law imposed vpon all both Clergie and Laitie, (for so they distinguish them) they have gathered their Service book verbatim out of the Masse book, turning out of Latine
into English the Suffrages, Prayers, Let any Collects, &c. (leaving out some of the gross pointes therin) keping still the old fashio of Psalmes, Chapters, Pistles, Gospell versicles, respondes, also T Deum, Benedtus, Magnificat, Nunc dimittis, Our Father Lord have mercy vpon vs, The Lord be wi you, O Lord open thw my lyps, Glory to God high, Lyft vp your harts, O come let vs reioyc Glory be to the Father, Quicunque vult, & These doe they read dayly morninge an evening all the yeare long in their priest vestures, Surplice, cope, &c. some the saye, and some they sing, having in the Cathedrall Churches, the Organs, Querters, singing men and boyes, as in tymes pa in popey.Some of them in certaine English books set forth, have reckned above 100. popish corruptiōs yet reteyned in this Church. Many popish errors yet remayn in that book, which their own preacher have noted, & found fault with. There a they prescribed what prayers to read ov the dead, over the con & grasse, some time in the yeare. By it are they injoyned keep their holy dayes to their Lady ( they cal her) to all Saincts and Angel to all Christs Apostles, (except Paul a Barnabas) whose eyes they are cōmande to fast, as also their Lent & Ember day besides frydayes and saturdayes throug out the whole year. By this book are t Ministers instructed how to marry, wi the signe of the Ring, &c. to baptise the hallowed Font, with signe of
crosse, with Godfathers and Godmothers, asking the child whether it wil forsake the devil and all his works, &c. to mi∣nister also their other sacrament or com∣munion to the people kneling, as when in popery they received their maker, the words of Christs institution altered, and others in stead of them taken out of the popes portuis, with innumerable such like enormities and fopperies wherewith it swarmeth. And this is all the worship and service which many parishes have v∣sually, except peradventure some writ∣ten Homilies which the vnlearned Priests read vnto them. This service must first be read, and hath the preeminence, even on the Lords dayes, before any preaching, yea before the Bible it self. He that can read this book distinctly, is fit ynough with them to be a Preist, yea many that have ben Artificers, as Shoemakers, Taylers, Weavers, Porters, &c, and without any giftes or knowledg at all, save only to read English, have ben and are admitted, & to this day maynteyned by the Prelats in the Ministerie. To these Churches Ministers & Service must all the people there come every daye, yea though they hav in the next parish a Prea∣cher, and in their own a dumb vnlearned Priest, yet are they all tyed to their owne Church and Minister, and must at the
least twise a yeare, receve the Sacramēt at his hāds. If they refuse this, or do not ordinarily come to their parish Church, thē are they sūmoned, excōmunicated, & impri∣soned tyl they become obedient▪ In this bō∣dage are our countrymen there held vnder their Priests and Prelats: and such as by the word of God witnes against and con∣demne these abhominations, they hate, punish, put to death, and persecute out of the Land. Who now in whom any spark of true light is. cannot playnly perceive this their Ministery worship and Church to be false & adulterate? Doth Christs eternall testa∣ment ordeyn and approve of such popish Lordes and Prelats to reigne over his Church? Are these, those Christian Bishops that isRom. 12. 1. Cor. 12. Eph. 4. 11. 12 13. Pastors, Teachers, and Elders, which he hath set in his Church and over his owne people vnto the ende of the world? Or can those Preachers which are thus created and deposed by, thus sworne and obedient vnto their spiri∣tuall Lordes, be deemed true Teachers of the Gospell of Christ lawfully called and ordeyned to that Ministerye? Is that their English Masse theIoh. 4. 24. Mat. 15. 9. trew & spirituall wor∣ship of God according to his owne wil? We are taught in the scripturesDeut. 6. 4. 5 Mat. 16. 6.  Cor. 6. 14. 15. Psal. 106. 34. 35. 36. that there can be no agrement made betwixt Christ and Antichrist, betwixt the Lawes
of God and mens traditions; that the ser∣vants of Iesus may not submitt vnto or re∣ceive the marke of that Beast, neyther drinke of the cup of the whore of Ba∣bylons fornications, or buy any of her wares; but mustIudo. vers. 3. contend for the maynte∣nance of that saith which was once gyven vnto the saincts, keeping their souls and bo∣dyes pure frō Antichristiā pollutions, touch∣ing 2 Cor. 6. 17. Eph. 5. 11. no vnclean thing, nor having any fel∣lowship with the vnfruteful works of dark∣nes, leastRev. 18. 4. & 14. 10, 11. by partaking with their synnes they receve also of their plagues, & drynck of the wyne of the wrath of God, & be tormented in fyre and brimstone, before the holy Angels and before the Lamb for evermore. If Christ be God, let vs follow him: but if the Pope be God, what shall we say? Why have we left him, his Church and ministery, his worship & jurisdiction, or what halting and mocking with the Lord is this,Mat. 6. 24. to put away the Popes per∣son, 2 Kin. 16. 10, 11, 12. Revl. 13. 12. 14. 15. and reteyne his Prelacy and Ministe∣ry, his Lawes, Traditions and Canons, his worship & service: or at the least to frame vnto our selves a worship Ministery and Church after the patterne and mould of the Apostasy of Rome? which what other thing is it, then to make an Image of that wild beast, and force men to worship it? Thus seest thow briefely (good Christi∣an Reader) the thinges which we mislike
in the Church of England, and for which we have separated our selves as God com∣maundeth. . 51. 6. Mi 2. 10. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 17. To all these, if we were a∣mongst them, should we be forced to submitt our bodyes & soules, or els suffer violence at the handes of the Prelats,. 40. & end our lives by violent death or most miserable imprisonment, as many of our brethren before vs have done. For so great is the malice and power of those Romysh Priests, that they persecute vnto death such as speak against them: and such poor Christians as they cast into their noysome prysons, can seldome or never get out (except with shipwrack of conscience) vn∣til they be caryed forth vpon the Bere. Neyther is there any care taken for their relief in this case: but being cast into pry∣son, there they are deteyned without any alloweance of meat or money for their mayntenance, be their want and poverty never so great. If they have any thing of their own, there they are driven to spend it vp: if they have nothing, there they are left by the Prelates to feed on the ayre. And that they may more readily be sterved, or weakened in the truth, they are cōmonly shut vp in close pryson, their frends & acquayntance being not suffred to come at them: Nay even their wives & children being kept and debarred from them by the tyranny of these bloody Pre∣lats
and their Instruments: whose hard harts and vnnaturall cruelty, if thou did∣dest vnderstand (gentle Reader) as many of vs haue felt and to this day yet feel, it would make thy hart to bleed, considering their vnmercyfull and barbarous dealing. And how many soules haue perished in their prisons through miserable vsage, how many have ben put to death, and how many banished, though we could to their eter∣nall infamy relate to all the world, yet wil we not blaze abroad their acts (for we take no delight in laying opē their shame) but mourne for them in secret, cōmitting our cause to God that judgeth justly, kno∣wing that he that maketh inquisition for blood remembreth it,Psal. 9. 12. and will not forget the com∣plaint of the poore. And thou (Christian Reader) vouch safe to remember vnto God in thy prayers such as yet remayne in bandes and pryson amongest them for the testimony of Iesus,Heb. 13. 3. enduring a hard sight of afflictions, and having the sentence of death in them selves, are like (if the Lord send not vnexspected deliverance) there to end their dayes. Concerning our selves, who through the mercy of God have found a place of rest in this land, for which benefyt we are alwayes and every where humbly thankfull: we desyre (Christian Reader) thy charitable and Christian opinion of
and holy prayers vnto God for vs, whose kingdome we seek, whose ordinances we desire to establish and obey: protesting with good consciences, that it is the truth of his Gospel only for which we strive a∣gainst those cursed reliques of Antichristian apostasie: vnto which we dare in no wise submit our selves, no not for a moment. For if it be not lawfull for Christians at this day to reteyn the ceremonyes of Mo∣ses Law together with the Gospel, as the Passeover, Circumcision, the Priesthood, Sacri∣fices, &c.Gal. 4. 4. 5. 6. &. 5. 1. 2. Heb. 8. & 9. & 10. chap. which yet were once cōmanded by God himself: how can we think it tollerable to observe the odious ceremo∣nies of Antichrist, or submit our selves to his lawes, Priesthood, Hierarchie, & traditions, which the Lord never allowed, & which never entred into his heart: yea which he hath so severely forbidden, with fearfull judgments threatned vnto all that shal so do. But because we have ben very grievously slaundred in our owne nation, and the bruit thereoff hath followed vs vnto this land, whereby we have ben hardly deemed of by many without cause, we have ben forced at length to publysh this brief but true Confession of our fayth, for the clearing of our selves from sclaunder, and satisfying of many who desired to knowe the thinges we hold. Wherein if in any thing we erre
(as who is so perfit that he erreth not) we crave (good Reader) thy Christian bro∣therly censure and information, promising alwayes (through the grace of God) to yeild vnto the truth when it shall be further shewed vs, and leave our errors when by the light of his word they shalbe reproved. In lyke manner it shall be thy par and duty to acknowledge and submytt vnto the truth, by whomsoever it is professed, looking alwayes rather to the preciousnes of the treasure it self then to the base∣nes of the vessels which conteyne it,2. Cor. 4.  or the infirmities of those that witnes the same: in whose mortall bodyes thow shalt see nothing but the markes and dying of our Lord Iesus Christ.Iam. 2. . But hold not thy fayth in respect of mens persons, neyther be thow moved at the evyl reports which have ben raised of vs. Here hast thow the trew summe of our Christian saith: try al thinges by the true light of Gods word: and if thou shalt reap any profit by these our labours, give God the glory, and remember vs vnto him in thy prayers. Farewell in Christ Iesus. 1596.

Finally the dispensations which they vse for Plurali∣ty of benefices, licences of Non residen∣cy, Licences to mary and eat flesh (both which with them are on certain dayes & tymes forbidden, &c,) These, we say, are
sufficient proofes of the former assertion, the particulars therin being duly exami∣ned by & compared to the rules of Christs Testament. Not to speak here, of their pri∣vate Baptisme, of the signe of the Crosse vsed in Baptisme, of questions propoun∣ded to the infants, of the Priests surplice, prayer over the dead at buriall, kneeling at the Lords supper, and other the like po∣pish corruptions, almost infinite, reteyned and allowed among them.

Tributes, Customes, and all other such lawfull & accustomed dutyes, ought willingly and orderly to be payed and performed: Our lands, goods, and bodyes, to be submitted in the Lord to the Magistrates pleasure. And the Ma∣gistrates themselves every way to be ac∣knowledged, reverenced, and obeyed ac∣cording to godlines, not because of wrath onely but also for conscience sake: And finally, all men so to be estemed and re∣garded, as is due and meet for their place, age, estate and condition.

XLIIII. And thus, we labour to giue vnto God yt which is Gods & vnto Cesar that which is Cesars, and vnto all men, that which be∣longeth vnto them: Endevoring our selves to have alwayes a cleare conscience to∣wards God and towards men: And ha∣ving hope in God that the resurrection of the dead shalbe of the just vnto life, & of the vnjust vnto condemnation, ever∣lasting. Now if any take this to be he∣resie, then do we with the Apostle freely confesse that after the way which they call heresie, we worship God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, beleeving all things that are written in the Law and in the Prophets and Apostles: and what∣soever is according to this rule of truth published in our owne countrey or hol∣den by any reformed Churches in their Confessions abroad in the world. We do also reiect and detest all straunge and he∣retical opinions & doctrines of all Hereticks both old and new whatsoever.

Finally, whereas we are much slaun∣dered and traduced as if we denyed or misliked that forme of prayer commonly called the Lords prayer: we thought it need∣ful here also cōcerning it to make known, that we beleev and acknowledg it to be a most absolute and most excellent forme of prayer, such as no men nor Angels can set downe the like. And that it was taught and appointed by our Lord Iesus Christ, not that we should be tyed to the vse of those very words, but that we should according to that rule make all our re∣quests and thankesgiving vnto God, for∣asmuch as it is a perfect forme & patterne, conteining in it plaine & sufficient dire∣ctions of prayer, for all occasions & neces∣sities, that have ben, are, or shalbe, to the Church of God, or any member therof, to the end of the world.

¶The heads of the differences between vs and the Church of England as it standeth at this day, con∣cerning divers corruptions of An∣tichrist yet remayning among them. I. THat Christ the Lord hath by his last Testament given to his Church, and set therein, sufficient ordinary Offices, with the maner of calling or Entrance, Works, and Main∣tenance, for the administration of his holy things, and for the sufficient ordinary instru∣ction guydance & service of his Church, to the end of the world. 2. That every particular Church hath like & full interest & power to enioy and practise all the ordinances of Christ given by him to his Church to be observed therein perpetually. 3. That a true visible Church, is a com∣pany of people called and separated from the world by the word of God, and ioyned to∣gether by voluntarie profession of the faith of
Christ, in the fellowship of the Gospell. And that therefore no prophane persons, vnbeleevers or wicked livers, may be received reteyned or c̄pelled to be members in the Church of Christ, which is his body; God having in all ages appointed & made a separation of his people from the world, before the Law, vnder the Law, & now in the tyme of the Gospel. 4. That discreet, faithfull, & able men (though not yet in office of Ministerie) may preach the Gospell and whole truth of God, that men being first brought to knowledg, & con∣verted to the Lord, may then be ioyned toge∣ther in holy comunion with Christ our head and one with another. 5. That being thus ioyned, every Church hath power in Christ to chuse and take vnto themselves meet and sufficient persons, into the Offices and functions of Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons and Helpers, as those which Christ hath appointed in his Testament, for the fee∣ding, governing, serving, & building vp of his Church. And that no Antichristian Hie∣rarchie or ministerie, of Popes. Arch-bishops,
Lord bishops, Suffraganes, Deanes, Arch-dea∣cons, Chauncellors, Parsons, Vicars, Priests, Dumb-ministers, or any such like, may be set over the Spouse & Church of Christ, nor reteined therein. 6. That the Ministers aforesaid being lawfully called by the Church where they are to administer, ought to continew in their fun∣ctions according to Gods ordinance, and care∣fully to fed the flock of Christ cōmitted vnto them, being not inioyned or suffred to beare Civil offices withall, neither burthened with the execution of Civil affaires, as the celebra∣tion of mariage, buying the dead &c. which things belong aswel to those without as with∣in the Church. 7. That the due maintenance of the Of∣ficers aforesayd, should be of the free and vo∣luntarie contribution of the Church, that accor∣ding to Christs ordinance, they which preach the Gospel may live of the Gospel: and not by Popish Lordships and livings, or Iewish Tithes & Offerings. And that therefore the Lands & other like revenewes of the Prelats & Cler∣gie
yet remayning (being still also baits to al∣lure the Iesuites & Seminaries into the Land, & incitements vnto them to plot & prosecute their woonted evil courses, in hope to enioy them in tyme to come) may and ought to be taken away, & converted to better vse, as those of the Abbeyes & Nunneries have been heretofore by the Princes power and authority, to the honor of God & great good of the Reālme. 8. That al particular Churches ought to be so constituted, as having their own peculiar Offi∣cers, the whole body of every Church may meet together in one place, & ioyntly perform their duties to God & one towards another. And that the censures of admonition and excommunicatiō should in due maner be executed, for sinne, con∣victed, & obstinatly stood in. This power also to be in the body of the Church whereof the parties so offending & persisting are members. 9. That the Church is not to be governed by Popish Canons, Courts, Classes, Customes, or any humane inventions, but by the Lawes & rules which Christ hath appointed in his Testament. That no Apocrypha writings, but only the Ca∣nical
scriptures are to be vsed in the Church. And that the Lord is to be worshipped and called v∣pon in spirit & truth, according to that forme of praier given by the Lord Iesus, Mat. 6. & after the Leitourgie of his own Testament, not by any other framed or imposed by men, much lesse by one translated from the Popish , as the Book of common praier &c. 10. That the Sacraments, being seales of Gods covenant, ought to be administred onely to the faithful, & Baptisme to their seed or those vnder their government. And that according to the simplicitie of the Gospel, without any Po∣pish or other abuses, in either Sacrament. 11. That the Church is not to be vrged to the observation of dayes & tymes, Iewish or Po∣pish, save only to sanctify the Lords day: Neyther to be laden in thinges indifferent, with rites & ceremonies, Whatsoever invented by men; but that christian libertie may be retened: And what God hath left fee, none to make bound. 12. That al monuments of Idolatry in gar∣ments or any other things, al Temples, Altars, Chappels, & other places dedicated heertofore
by the Heathèns or Antichristians to their fa worship, ought by aucthoritie to be rased & bolished, not suffered to remayne, for nourish∣ing superstition, much lesse imploied to the tr worship of God. 13. That Popish degrees in Theologie, i forcement to single life in Colledges, abuse the study of prophane heathen Writers, w other like corruptions in Schooles & Academi should be removed & redressed, that so th may be the welsprings &  series of true lea¦ning & godlines. 14. Finally that all Churches & peop (without exception) are bound in Religion on¦ly to receive & submit vnto that constitution Ministerie, Worship, & order, which Christ Lord & King hath appovnted vnto his Churc & not to any other devised by Man whatsoeve Let him that readeth, consider.
