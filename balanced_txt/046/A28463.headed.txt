Fragmenta Antiquitatis. ANTIENT TENURES OF LAND, And Jocular CUSTOMS Of some MANNORS· Made publick for the di∣version of some, and in∣struction of others. By T.B. of the Inner-Temple Esquire. —Neque semper Arcum tendit Apollo. Hor. LONDON, Printed by the Assigns of Richard and Edward Atkins, Esquires. For Abel Roper, at the Sun, Tho. Basset, at the George, and Christopher Wilkinson, at the Black-Boy, all in Fleetstreet, 1679.
TO THE READER. WHilst I was perusing many of our both publick & private Records for other ends, I thought a small Collection of some remarkable Te∣nures of Land and unusual Customs of some Mannours might not be unaccep∣table to the Studious, who when weary with poring upon Littletons Tenures, and his Learned Commentator, might relax are fibulam by recurring to these, and smile at the inoffensive mirth both of our Kings in former times, and Lords of Mannours, in creating them; some of which I confess are since, con∣verted into a Rent, having a modo ar∣rentatur enter'd in the Record, others are by length of time disused, and o∣thers
yet remain in force: As not long since I had the curiosity to ask an old Officer in the Exchequer, whether he ever remembred any Herring Pies paid to the King for the Mannour of Carle∣ton in Norfolk? yes, very well, an∣swered he, for we had some of them in Court among us here last Term, Nor does the late Act of Parliament, for taking away all Tenures by Knight-service and Capite, extend to the dis∣charging the honorary Services of Grand Serjeanty, other than of Wardship, Mariage, &c. but are left standing on their old foundation by a particular Proviso in that Act.Stat. 12. Car. 2. ca. 24. Neither are these kind of Tenures unusual in other Countries▪ for we read of a Queen of Hungary, who upon her Death-bed bequeathed the City and Pro∣vince of Altenburg to one of the Lords of her Court, upon condition that he and his successors should always keep a certain number of Peacocks, in defect whereof the Territory should revert to the Crown. My first intention was to render all the Records in English; but upon se∣cond thoughts, I judge the original words would be more acceptable both to
the Learned and Learner; and for the help of the latter, have explained (to the best of my skill) those of any diffi∣culty, at least as many of them as I could, for some I believe may pose the ablest Glossographer now living; as Warocks, Muta deynectorum Canum, Heymectis, Cyppos, Berbiagium, Cha∣curos, Sensas, Muta vini & Gruna Vini, &c. Or, to speak more truly, I took them as I found them, some out of the very Records, others extracted thence, and translated to my hand; for I was not willing to spend very much time in rem levem, as Sir Henry Spel∣man words it, upon a liike occasion. And yet, as light as the subject may seem to be, I am very well informed, that Atturney General Noy had, a little be∣fore his Death, bespoke a Copy of all the Tenures by Serjeanty, remaining up∣on Record; 'tis like he judg'd them use∣ful, or divertising, or both. I have purposely omitted, or but rare∣ly mentioned, those more common Te∣nures, whereby the owner was obliged to deliver yearly into the Exchequer, a Mew'd Sparhawk, a pair of Spurs, Gloves or the like, of which kind I met with many, and held them not for
my purpose, which was to take in none but what were in some respect or other remarkable. Nor must I forget to advertise the Reader, that the names of divers Man∣nours and places here mentioned are written otherwise now, than they were of old, which the knowing in each County will easily reconcile: And, how∣ever others may like of this Essay, some Gentlemen of Antient descent, I pre∣sume, will be well enough pleased to see their Ancestors names thus revived and transmitted from our seldom seen Re∣cords to a more publick Register. No∣thing of this nature, having to my knowledge been ever till now, made publick. And I will be bold to say, the Studious in Law-latin and Record-learning shall not any where find so much singular of that kind collected in so small a Volume. Lege, Ride, Disce. Tho. Blount.

Dy∣mock (to whom the Court of Claymes had ad∣judged
the Office of the Kings Champion) en∣tred Westminster-Hall on a goodly white Courser armed at all points in rich armour, and having a Plume of blew Feathers in his Helm, he there made a stand for some time, and then advanced in manner following, way being made for him by the Knight Marshal, First two Trumpets, The Serjeant Trumpeter, The Serjeant at Arms, An Esquire carrying a Target, having the Champions own Arms depicted thereon.

that he ought not to enjoy the same, here is his Champion, who saith that he lieth, and is a false Traitor, being ready in person to combate with him, and in this Quarrel will adventure his life against him, on what day soever he shall be appointed. Thereupon the Champion threw down his Gantlet, which lying some small time, and no body taking it up, it was delivered unto him again by York-Herald. Then all advanced for∣ward until the Champion came to the middle of the Hall, where York-Herald made the like Procla∣mation, and the Gantlet was again thrown down and after some time returned to the Champion, who advanced to the foot of the ascending steps to the state, and at the top of the steps the said Herald proclaimed the Challenge the third time, whereupon the Champion threw down his Gantlet again, which no body taking up, it was finally delivered to him. This being done, the Earl of Pembroke and Mongomery, with Viscount Montagu, and the Lord Paget his Assistants, presented on the knee to the King a Guilt Cup with a Cover full of wine, who drank to his Champion, and by the said Earl sent him the Cup, who, after three Reverences, drank it all off, went a little backward, and so departed the Hall, taking the Cup for his Fee, according as had been adjudged him by the Court of Claims.

For the keeping of which Forest and Farm they ought to have all the rights and appurte∣nances here under written. All Foresters in Fee of the said Forest shall be attendant and answerable to them, as to the chief Forester of the said Forest, and they ought to have the Horse and furniture, Saddle, Bridle, Sword and Horn of such Foresters in Fee; when they dye. And they ought to have their Estovers of Housebote and Haybote through the whole Bail aforesaid; and all amerciaments for de∣faults made at the Court of the Forest; and all Pleas of Hares;Hcymed∣is. q. Nets, — Badgers, Fox∣es,
Wyldcats, and Partridges; And all Amercia∣ments for the escapes of wild beasts, and for dead wood in the whole year, except in the fence month (which was from fifteen dayes before Midsommer day to fifteen dayes after) and was also called Tempus de Foyneson; because the Dear did then fawn, or bring forth their young; & to have all their Cattle, except Sheep and Goats, during the whole year quit of Herbage, and their Hogs quit of Paunage for the whole year, except in the Fence moneth; and they ought to have the Estrays of the whole Forest, and the Amerciaments for expedita∣ting Dogs, and Airys of Sparhawks, Honey and Nuts and Hipps through the whole Forest after every Regard there made:q.

And they ought to have on the said Farm, whatsoever is thrown down by the wynd, except Wood, which belongs to our Lord the King. And This Retropaunage I suppose is the latter or after Paunage; for Paunage be∣gins at Michaelmas and ends at Saint Martyns, in which time the Beech Mast and Acorns are ripe and fall. And Retropaunage begins at St. Mar∣tyns and ends at Candlemass in which time Hipps and Hawes and such like Berries yeild some nutriment to Swyne and Poultry.

Coringham.Hist. of St. Pauls. by Sir W. Dugdale In the Third year of King Edward the First Sir William le Baud Knight made a signal Grant to the Dean and Canons of St. Pauls Lon∣don, of a Doe yearly on the feast of the Conver∣sion of Saint Paul, and of a fat Buck upon the Commemoration of the same Saint, to be of∣fered at the high Altar in St. Pauls by the said Sir William and his household-family, and then to be distributed among the Canons resident; which said Doe and Buck were so given by him in lieu of 22 acres of Land lying within the Lordship of Westlee in Com. Essex, belonging to the said Canons and by them granted to him and his heyrs to be enclosed within his Park of Coringham. But about the certain time and formality in offering the said Buck and Doe there growing afterwards some dispute, Sir Walter le Baud Knight son and heyr of the said Sir William, by his Deed dated on the Ides of July, 30 Edward 1. for the health of his Soul and of his Progenitors and heyrs, confirm∣ed his said Fathers Grant and obliged himself and his heyrs, his Lands and Tenements, That every year for ever on the day of the Con∣version of St. Paul, there should be a good fat Doe, brought by one of his fitting Servants and not the whole family, at the hour of Procession, and through the midst thereof, and offer'd at the High Altar, without exacting any thing for the said service of the Dean and Canons. And on the day of the Commemoration of St.
Paul in Summer, a fat Buck by some such Servant, attended with as many of the Family as had heretofore been usual, and so carryed through the midst of the Procession, and of∣fer'd at the high Altar; the said Dean and Canons, after the Offering thus performed, giving, by the hands of their Chamberlain, one shilling to the persons bringing the Buck for their entertainment. And to this grant were witnesses Sir Nicholas de Wokyndon, Sir Richard de la Rokele, Sir Thomas de Mande∣vyle, Sir John de Rocheford Knights, with divers others. [The reception of which Doe and Buck was till Queen Elizabeths days so∣lemnly performed at the steps of the Quire by the Canons of St. Pauls, attired in their sacred Vestments and wearing Garlands of Flowers on their heads; and the horns of the Buck carri∣ed on the top of a Spear in Procession round about within the body of the Church with a gr noise of horn blowers,Camd. in Midelsex. as the lear∣ned Camden, upon his own view of both, af∣firmes.

These are the Rights which belong to Ro∣bert Fitz-Walter, Castellan of London, Lord of Wodeham, in the City of London: That is to say, that the said Robert and his heirs ought to be and are cheif Banner-bearers of London in Fee, for the Castelry, which he and his An∣cestors have of Baynards Castle in the said City. In the time of war the said Robert and his heirs ought to serve the City, in manner hereafter written. That the said Robert ought to come armed upon his Horse of service, with twenty men at Armes mounted upon Horses harnessed with Mail or with Iron, even to the great door of the Minster of St. Paul, with a Banner of his Armes displayed before him. And when he is come to the great door of the said Minster, mounted and armd as afore∣said, then ought the Mayor of London with all his Sheriffs and Aldermen, to come on foot ar∣med,
out of the Minster of St. Paul, to the said door, with his Banner in his hand, and the Banner ought to be Gules, an Image of St. Paul d'or, the feet, hands and head Argent, with a sword Argent in the hand of the said I∣mage. And as soon as the said Robert shall see the Mayor, and his Sheriffs and Aldermen coming on foot out of the said Minster armed with this Banner, he, or his heirs, who shall perform this service to the City, shall dismount his Horse and salute the Mayor, as his Companion and shall say to him, Sir Mayor I am come to do my service, which I owe to the City. And the May∣or, Sheriffs and Aldermen shall say, we allow you here as our Banner-bearer of this City in Fee, this Banner of the City to carry and govern to your power, to the Honour and profit of our Ci∣ty. And the said Robert and his heirs shall take the Banner in his hand: And the Mayor and Sheriffs of the said City shall follow him to the door, and present him with a Horse of xx l. price; which Horse shall have a Saddle garnish∣ed with the Arms of the said Robert and cove∣red with a Sendal of the same Armes; and shall deliver xx l. sterling to the Chamberlain of the said Robert, for his charges of that day. And the said Robert shall mount the Horse, which the Mayor then presented him, with the Banner in his hand, and as soon as he is moun∣ted, he shall desire the Mayor forthwith to cause a Marshall to be chosen out of the Host of the City of London. And as soon as the Mar∣shall
is chosen, the said Robert shall command the Mayor and his Burgesses of the City, to cause the common Signal to be sounded through the City, that all the Communalty may follow the Banner of St. Paul (carried before them by the said Roberts own hand) to Algate, to which the said Robert and the Mayor shall as∣sent. If it so happen, that the said Robert shall march out of the City, then he shall choose two of the most sage persons out of every Ward of the City, to take care how it may best be guarded in his absence; and this Council shall be held in the Priory of the Trinity, near Aldgate. And before every Town or Castle which the Army of London shall beseige, if he continue a year about the seige, the said Robert ought to have from the Commons of London, one hundred shillings for his pains, and no more. These are the Rights which the said Robert ought to have in London in the time of War.These are the Rights appertaining to Robert le Fitz-Walter and his heirs, in London in time of Peace. That is to say; that the said Robert hath a Soke in the City of London, viz. from the Wall of the Canonry of St. Paul as a man goes down by the Boe∣house. Bracine of St. Paul to the Thames and so to the side of the Mill which stands on the water that runs down by Fleet-Bridge, and thence by London Walls round about the Friers Preachers, to Ludgate: And so returns by the
back of the said Friers House, to the corner of the said Canons Wall of St. Paul. That is to say, all the Parish of the Church of St. St. An∣drew Wardrobe. Andrew which is in the gift of his Ancestors, by the said Seignory. The said Robert hath also apppendant to this Soke, all these things here under written: That he ought to have a Sokeman of his own choice, provided he be of the Sokemanry. And if any of the Sokemanry shall be impleaded in the Guild Hall for any matter which touches not the bo∣dy of the Mayor for the time being, or any She∣riff of the said City, it shall be lawful for the Sokeman of the Sokemanry of the said Robert le Fitz-Walter, to demand the Court of the said Robert le Fitz-Walter. And the Mayor and Citizens of London ought to grant him to have his Court, in which his Judgment ought to be agreeable to that of the Guild-Hall. If any thief shall be taken In his Soke, he ought to have his flocks and impri∣sonment in his Soke, and from thence he shall be carried to the Guild-Hall before the Mayor, to receive his Judgment, which ought there to be given; but the Judgment shall not be pronounced, untill he come in the Court of the said Robert and in his Franchise. And the Judgment shall be such; If he have deserved death for Treason, he ought to be tied to a Pil∣lar which stands in the Thames at Wood-wharf, whereunto Water-men tye their Barges or Boats, and there continue two Floods and two Ebbs of the Water. And if he be condemned for a common Larcin, he ought to be hangd at
the These Elms stood near smith∣feild and were the place of Executi∣on, before Tyburn had that Office. Elms, and there suffer his Judgment, as other common Thieves. Also the said Robert and his heirs have a great honour, in holding so great a Franchise in the said City, where the Mayor and Citizens ought to doe him right; that is to say, that when the Mayor is minded to hold a great Council, he ought to call the said Robert or his heirs, to be of his Council, and of the said Cities Coun∣cil: And the said Robert ought to be sworn of the Cities Council, against all people; save the King of England and his heirs. And when the said Robert shall come to the Hustings at the Guild-Hall of the said City, the Mayor or his Deputy ought to rise to him, and then place him by him. And whilst he is in the Guild-Hall, all Judgments ought to be pro∣nounced by his mouth, according to the Re∣cord of the Recorders of the Guild-Hall. And all the Waifs which shall happen, whilst he is there, he ought to give to the Bailifs of the City, or to whom he pleases, by advice of the Mayor of the said City.

Every Native or Villain (which were such as we now call husband∣men) paid each a Cock and a Hen, besides a small Rent in Money, for a Tost and one Bovat of Land, held of the Priory of Thur∣garton.

The Natives were likewise bound to give three Plowdays each, and every plow was to be allowed four boon-loaves, and to harrow three dayes, and every harrower was allowed a brown loaf and two herrings a day. Likewise all the Natives and Cotagers were to reap every other day in harvest, the first day every two were to have one brown loaf and two Toillects, the second day, two brown loaves and one Toillect, and afterwards every two men to have every day three brown loaves. And on the day of the great Bidrepe, which was called the Priors Boon, every Native was to find three Workmen and Cottager one. Every of the said Natives were to make carriage from the forain Granges thrice a year, each with one Horse, and every time to have a Miche or white loaf; And all the Reapers in Harvest which were called Hallewimen were to eat in the Hall one day in Christmas, or afterwards at the discretion of the Celerer. Likewise every Naif or she Villain that took a husband or com∣mitted fornication paid Marchet, for redemp∣tion of her blood, 5 s. 4 d. and the Daugh∣ter of a Cottager paid but half a Marchet.

Here I am, riding upon a black Ram, Like a Whore as I am; And for my Crincum Crancum, Have lost my Bincum bancum; And for my Tailes game, Am brought to this worldly shame.

The Steward and Suiters whisper to each other, and have no Candles, nor any Pen and Ink, but supply that office with a Coal; And he that ows suit or service thereto and appears not, forfeits to the Lord double his Rent every hour he is absent.

Coleshill. They have an antient Custom at Coleshill in the County of Warwick, that if the young∣men of the Town can catch a Hare, and bring it to the Parson of the Parish before ten of the clock on Easter-monday, the Parson is bound to give them a Calves head and a hundred of Eggs for their Breakfast, and a groat in money. Fiskerton and Moreton. The Custom was here,Reg. Pr∣rat. de Thurgar∣ton. for the Natives and Cottagers to Plow and Harrow for the Lord, and to work one Boon-day for him every week in Harvest, when every two workmen had three Boon-loaves with Companage allowed them. Each Customary Tenant in Fiskerton and Moreton (in Com. Not.) one day in the year found a man to cleanse the Dam of Fisker∣ton Mill. Si quis Braciatrix braciaverit Cere∣visiam, if any Alewife brewed Ale to sell, she was bound to satisfy the Lord for Tolsester. If any Native or Cottager sold a Male Youngling after it was weaned, he paid 4 d. to the Lord as a Fine; Or killed a Swine above a year old he paid the Lord one Peny, which was called Thistletac. Every she Native that married or committed Fornication, paid pro redemptione sanguinis, 5 s. 4 d. to the Lord which was in lieu of marcheta mulierum, which whether from Mark a Horse in the old Gallique (implying the obscene signification of equitare) as Mr. Sel∣den
thinks, or from Marca, the sum of money, by which it was afterwards commonly redeem∣ed, I cannot determine. Stanlake. At Stanlake in the County of Oxford the Mi∣nister of the Parish in his Procession in Rogation week,Nat. Hist. of Ox. sh. fo. 203. reads a Gospel at a Barrels head in the Cellar of the Chequer Inne in that Town, where some say there was formerly an Hermitage: Others, that there was antiently a Cross, at which they read a Gospel in former times, o∣ver which now the House and particularly the Cellar being built, they are forced to continue the Custom in manner as above. Burford. About the year 750,Ibid. fo. 348. a Battel was fought near Burford in Oxford-shire, perhaps on the place still called Battle-Edge, west of the Town to∣wards Ʋpton, between Cuthred or Cuthbert a Tributary King of the West Saxons, and Ethel∣bald King of Mercia, whose insupportable Ex∣actions the former King not being able to en∣dure, he came into the Field against Ethelbald, met and overthrew him there, winning his Banner whereon was depicted a Golden Dragon, in memory of which Victory, the Custom (yet within memory) of making a Dragon yearly and carrying it up and down the Town in great jollity on Midsomer Eve, to which they added the Picture of a Giant, was in all likelyhood first instituted.
Ensham. It has been the Custom at Ensham in Oxford¦shire, for the Towns people on Whit-Monday,Nat. Hist. of Ox. sh. to cut down and bring away (where-ever the Church-Wardens pleased to mark it out, by gi∣ving the first Chop) as much timber as could be drawn by mens hands into the Abby-yard, whence if they could draw it out again, not∣withstanding all the impediments could be given by the servants of the Abby, and since that by the Family of the Lord, it was then their own, and went in part at least to the reparation of their Church: And by this Custom, as some will have it, they hold both their Lammas and Michaelmas Common.

Lodebrook. Ex. Antiq. Rentali ejusd. Man.In the Mannor of Lodebrook in the County of Warwic, whereof the Catesbyes were hereto∣fore Lords, each Tenant paid I know not what this Swarf-money may signify, unless it were miswritten for Warth-money, or Ward-money. Swarf-money year∣ly, which was one peny half-peny; It must be paid (says the Rental) before the rising of the Sun, the party must go thrice about the Cross, and say, The Swarf-Money, and then take wit∣ness, and lay it in the hole; And when he hath so done, he must look well that his witness do not deceive him, for if it be not paid, he giveth a great forfeiture, thirty shillings and a white Bull. Chester. In the time of King John,Sir Pet. Lyc. Hist. Antiqui∣ties of Chesshire. Randle the third sirnamed Blundevil Earl of Chester, having ma∣ny Conflicts with the Welch was at last di∣stressed by them and forced to retreat to the Ca∣stle of Rothelent in Flint shire, where they be∣sieged him, who presently sent to his Constable of Chester, Roger Lacy, sirnamed Hell for his fiery spirit, that he would come with all speed and bring what forces he could for his relief. Ro∣ger having gathered a tumultuous rout of Fidlers Players, Coblers and other debauched persons both men and Women out of the City of Chester
(for 'twas then the Fair there) marched im∣mediately with them towards the besieged Earl. The Welch, perceiving a great multitude com∣ing, raised the siege and fled. The Earl, com∣ing back with his Constable to Chester, gave him power over all the Fidlers and Shoemakers of Chester in reward and memory of this service. The Constable reteined to himself and his heirs the authority and donation of the Shoemakers, but John his Son conferred the Authority over the Lechers and Whores on his Steward, which then was Dutton of Dutton, by this his deed. Sciant praesentes & futuri, quod ego Johannes Constabularius Cestriae, dedi & concessi & hac praesenti Carta confirmavi Hugoni de Dutton & haeredibus suis Magistratum omnium Leccatorum & Meretricum totius Cestershiriae, sicut liberius illum magistratum teneo de Comite. Salvo jure meo mihi & heredibus meis. Hiis testibus — Though this original Grant makes no menti∣on of giving Rule over Fidlers and Minstrels, yet ancient Custom has now reduced it onely to the Minstrelsey; for probably the Rout which the Constable brought to the Rescue of the Earl, were debauched persons drinking with their Sweethearts in the Fair, the Fidlers that atten∣ded them and such loose persons as he could get. Anno 14-Hen 7. a Quo Waranto was brought against Laurence Dutton of Dutton Esquire,Inter Pla∣cita apud cestriam. 14 H. 7. to shew why he claimed all the Minstrels of Che∣shire and the City of Chester, to appear before him at Chester yearly on the Feast of Saint John Baptist, and to give him at the said Feast quatuor Lagenas Vini & unam Lanceam. i. Four Fla∣gons
of wine and a Lance, and also every Min∣strel then to pay him four pence halfpeny, and why he claimed from every Whore in Chesshire and the City of Chester (Officium suum exercen∣te) four pence yearly at the said feast, &c. Whereunto he pleaded prescription. The heirs of this Hugh de Dutton enjoy the same power and Authority over the Minstrelsy of Cheshire even to this day, and keep a Court every year upon the Feast of Saint John Baptist at Chester, being the Fair day, where all the Min∣strels of the County and City do attend and play before the Lord of Dutton upon their several In∣struments: He or his Deputy then riding through the City, thus attended to the Church of St. John, many Gentlemen of the County accompanying him, and one walking before him in a Surcoat of his Arms, depicted upon Taffata; And after Divine Service ended holds his Court in the City, where he or his Steward renews the old Licences granted to the Minstrels, and gives such new ones as he thinks fit, under the Hand and Seal of himself or his Steward, none pre∣suming to exercise that faculty there without it. But now this Dominion or priviledge is by a Daughter and heir of Thomas Dutton devolved to the Lord Gerard of Gerards Bromley in Staf∣fordshhire. And whereas by the Statute of 39 Eliz▪ Fid∣lers are declared to be Rogues,Stat. 39. Eliz. cap. 4. yet by a special Proviso therein those in Chesshire, Licenced by Dutton of Dutton, are exempted from that in∣famous Title, in respect of this his ancient Cu∣stome and priviledge.

And is so unusuall a Custom, that perhaps it may be hard to find the like elsewhere in England. Honington. Inq. per H. Nott.The Tenants of the Mannor of Honington in the County of Warwic were by antient Custom to perform several services to the Lord every o∣ther day from Midsummer to Michaelmas. To pay six shillings, and eight pence yearly for main∣tenance of the Lords Corn-Cart, and none of them to sell his Horse-Colt without licence from the Lord. Hampton.

Dunmow. The Custome of the Priory of Dunmow in the County of Essex was such,Reg. Prio∣rat. it. de Dun∣mow. That if any person from any part of England came thither, and humbly kneeled on two stones at the Church∣door (which are yet to be seen) and solemnly took the ensuing Oath before the Prior and Con∣vent, he might demand of them a Gamon or Flitch of Bacon, You shall swear by the Custom of our Confession, That you never made any Nuptial transgression, Since you were married to your wife, By household brawles, or contentious strife; Or otherwise in bed or at board Offended each other in deed or in word, Or since the Parish Clerk said Amen Wished your selves unmarried agen; Or in a twelve moneth and a day Repented not in thought any way;
But continued true and in desire, As when you joyned hands in holy Quire. If to these conditions, without all fear, Of your own accord you will freely swear, A Gamon of Bacon you shall receive, And bear it hence with love and good leave; For this is our custom at Dunmow well known, Though the sport be ours, the Bacon's your own. It appeareth in an old Register of this Priory, That Richard Wright of Badesnorth in Nor∣folk, in the 23 of Henry the sixth, when John Canon was Prior, that Steven Samuel of Little Easton in Essex 7o Edward 4. when Roger Rulcot was Prior▪ And that Thomas Lee of Coxal in Essex 2 Hen. 8. when John Taylor was Prior, demanded their Bacon, upon the terms abovesaid, and received it accordingly.

The Earl of Devon. is Prior. all the Musicians within the Honour are to repair to the Bailiffs House in Tutbury, where the Steward of the Court (who is usually a noble man) and rhe Woodmaster or his Lieutenant are to meet them, from whence they goe to the Church in this order, I two wind Musicians as Trumpets or long Pipes, then four string Mu∣sicians, two and two, all playing: then the Steward of the Court or his deputy and the Bai∣liff of the Mannor, deputed by the Earl of De∣von. the King of Musick going between them: After whom the four Stewards of Musick, each with a white Wand in his hand, and the rest of the company follow in order. At the Church the Vicar of Tutbury for the time being reads the service of the day, for which every Musician pays him a peny; Then all goe from the Church to the Castle in manner as be∣fore, Where the Steward takes his place upon
the Bench in Court, assisted with the Bailiff and Woodmaster, the King of Musick sitting between them, to see that every minstrel within the Honor, being call'd and making default, be presented and amerced by the Jury, which Amercements are collected by the Stewards of Musick, who accompt the one Moity to his Ma∣jesties Auditor, the other they retein themselves for their pains in collecting them. When the King, Steward and the rest are so fate, the Steward commands an Oyez to be made three times by one of the Musicians, as Crier of the Court, that all Minstrels within the Honor, residing in the Counties of Stafford, Der∣by, Nottingham Leicester or Warwick, do appear to do their suit and service, on such pain and peril as the Court shall inflict for their default, Essoynes nevertheless are allowed, in excuse of defaulters, upon good reason shewed. After which all the said Minstrels are called by a Sute-roll, as Suitors are in a Court Leet, And then two Juries are empanelled of the chief Minstrells, by the Stewards of Musick, each Jury consisting of 12, which are returned into the Court, where the Steward swears them; The form of their oath is the same which is gi∣ven in a Court-Leet, only in a Leet the Jury swear to keep the Kings Counsel, their fellows and their own, in this to keep the King of Mu∣sicks Counsel, their fellows and their own. The better to inform the Jurors of their duty the Steward gives them a charge, in commen∣dation of the antient Science of Musick, shewing what admirable effects it has produced, what
Kings and Noble persons have been Professors of it, what manner of persons the Professors ought to be, and to admonish them to choose skilful and good men to be Officers for the year ensu∣ing. The Officers chosen by the Jurjes are one King and three Stewards of Musick, the fourth is chosen by the Steward of the Court, the King is chosen one year out of the Minstrells of Stafford shire, and the next year out of those of Derby shire. The Steward of the Court issues out Warrants to the Stewards of Musick in their several di∣stricts, by virtue whereof they are to distrain and levy in any City, Town Corporate or o∣ther place within the Honor, all such fines and Amerciaments as are imposed by the Juries on any Minstrel for offences committed against the dignity and honor of the profession; The one Moity of which Fines the Stewards account for at the next Audit, the other they retain them∣selves. As soon as the Charge is given an Oyez is made, with a Proclamation, that if any per∣son can inform the Court of any offence com∣mitted by any Minstrel within the said Honor, since the last Court, which is against the honor of his profession, let them come forth and they shall be heard. Then the Juries withdraw to consider of the points of the Charge, and the old Stewards of Musick bring into the Court a Treat of Wine, Ale and Cakes, and at the same time some Minstrels are appointed to en∣tertain the Company in Court with some merry
Airs. After which the Juries present one to be King for the year ensuing, who takes his oath to keep up all the dignities of that Noble Science &c. Then the old King ariseth from his place, resigning it and his white Wand to the new King, to whom he also drinks a glass of wine & bids him joy of his honour; And the old Stew∣ards do the like to the new, which done the Court adjourns to a certain hour after noon, and all return back in the same order they came to the Castle, to a place where the old King, at his own cost, prepares a dinner for the new King, Steward of the Court, Bailiff, Stewards of musick and the Jurymen. After dinner all the Minstrels repair to the Priory Gate in Tutbury; without any manner of weapons, attending the turning out of the Bull, which the Bailiff of the Mannor is obliged to provide, and is there to have the tips of his horns sawed off, his ears and tail cut off, his body smeared all over with Soap, and his nose blown full of beaten Pepper. Then the Steward causes Proclamation to be made, That all manner of persons, except Minstrels, shall give way to the Bull, and not come within forty foot of him at their own peril, nor hinder the Minstrels in their pursuit of him. After which proclamation the Priors Bailiff turns out the Bull among the Minstrels, and if any of them can cut off a piece of his Skin before he runs into Derby shire, then he is the King of Musicks Bull: But if the Bull get into Derby shire sound and uncut, he is the Lord Priors again. If the Bull be taken and a piece of him cut off,
then he is brought to the Bailiffs house and there collered and roped, and so brought to the bull∣ring in the highstreet in Tutbury, and there bai∣ted with Dogs, the first course in honour of the King of Musick, tha second in honour of the Prior, the third for the Town, and if more, for divertisement of the spectators; and after he is baited, the King may dispose of him as he plea∣ses. This usage is of late perverted, the young men of Stafford and Derby shires contend with cudgels about a yard long, the one party to drive the Bull into Derby shire, the other to keep him in Stafford shire, in which contest ma∣ny heads are often broken. [The King of Mu∣sick and the Bailiff have also of late compounded, the Bailiff giving the King five Nobles in lieu of his right to the Bull, and then sends him to the Earl of Devons Mannor of Hardwick to be fed and given to the Poor at Christmas.] FINIS.
