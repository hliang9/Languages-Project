And whereas it is found by experience that To∣lerating and Conniving at Papists keéping Schools or Instructing Youth in Literature, is one great reason of many of the Natives of this Kingdom continuing ignorant of the Principles of True Re∣ligion, and Strangers to the Scriptures, and of their neglecting to conform themselves to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, and of their not using the English Habit and Language, to the great prejudice of the Publick-Weal thereof.

Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That one Act of Parliament made in the Twenty eighth Year of the Reign of the Late King Henry the Eighth, Called, An Act for the English Order, Ha∣bit and Language, whereby it is among other things Enacted & Provided, That every Incumbent of each
Parish within this Kingdom, shall keép or cause to be kept within the Place, Territory or Parish where he shall have Preheminence, Rule, Benefice or Pro∣motion a School to Learn English: And also one other Act made in the Twelfth Year of the Reign of the Late Queén Elizabeth, Intituled, An Act for the Erection of Free-Schools, whereby it is Enacted and Provided, That a publick Latin Freé-School shall be constantly maintained and kept within each Diocess of this Kingdom, which have general∣ly beén maintained and kept, but have not had the desired Effect by reason of such Irish Popish Schools, being too much Connived at, and all other Acts and Statutes now in Force in this Realm concerning Schools, shall from henceforth be strictly Observed and put in Execution according to the good Intent and Design of the same, and for the more Effectu∣al doing thereof the Iustices of His Majesties Court of Kings-Bench each Term, and the Iudg∣es of Assize in their Respective Circuits, and the Iustices of Peace in their General Sessions of Peace are Required to give this and the said for∣mer Acts in Charge from time to time to the seve∣ral Grand-Iuries to be then Impannelled and Charged, and to be very Circumspect in seéing the same put in due Execution.
