The True English Prophet: OR, ENGLANDS Happiness A Hundred Years Hence, To a New Play-House Tune. Licensed according to Order. I. COme chear up your Hearts, Boys, & all hands to Work, We'll be Happy and Blest, spight of Devil and Turk; Our Land you must know, we shall one day see flow With that dear Milk and Honey, Call'd Plenty and Money, If we can but a little with Patience dispence, Those Blest Days will be Ours all a Hundred Year's hence, II. By that time our Foes will be all Dead and Rotten, Our Quarrels all hush't, and our Troubles forgotten; His Gout, Stone and Pox, will have then done the work Of Europes Old Blood-hound, The most Christian Turk: For Lucifer waits his New Reign to Commence, And all long before a Hundred Years hence. III. Our Taxes we'll heartily pay in our Turns, Count it which way you please, for our Heads or our Horns We shall see that blest Day, when we ne're shall be poor, If our Wives have not sent us To Heav'n long before. Peace, Blessing, and Plenty, their Smiles will dispence At furthest within one poor Hundred Years hence. IV. And what, tho' thus long we have mourn'd the sad wants Of a Glass of good Bourdeaux, and Cup of fine Nants, We then shall have Wine, and Brandy most certain, A Quart for a Shilling, And Two-pence a Quartern; For the Generous French will that Favour dispence, If we happen to live but a Hundred Years hence. V. 'Tis true, no great store of Coin we can boast, Our Wealth and our Silver, alas, are Rid Post; But what, though the Clippers and Coiners have snip'd it, And o're the Herring-Pond The Wars they have whipp'd it, We shall role in Mill'd Crowns, Pounds, Shillings & Pence, If we live and do well but a Hundred Years hence. VI. In a Hundred Years time, how the World we shall settle, VVe shall certainly then have quite mended our Kettle, Our Disputes and our Titles, will then be Adjusted, And Monsieur by that time Perhaps may be trusted: Then England to France her smiles shall dispence In a General Peace a Hundred Years hence. VII. In Wedding, and Bedding, and Gossiping Rates. Tho' we now pay for Kissing, and getting of Brats; Our Grandsons will lay the young Girls on their Back. In the fear of the Lord, And without fear of Tax; Without Socket-Money, or Christning Expence, Take up the Smock Cheaper a Hundred Years hence. VIII. And what tho' our Citizens honest good People, In hopes of a New, and a swinging Paul's Steeple, Stand Gaping to see it Rise higher and higher; Whilst we Raise by our Coals What we Lost by our Fire, With that small yearly Rent they'll easily dispence: For Pauls will be Built in a Hundred Years hence, IX. Nay, the Bank Bills that Swagger'd so high, tho' of lat They're Dwindled to Twenty per Century Rebate, If you'll stay but a while, and be but so Civil To wait but till Knavery Is gone to the Devil; By that time they'll hold up their Heads, and speak sen If you can but have Patience t' a Hundred Years hence. X. The City will, then make their Orphans all Rich, Have pay'd off their Bedlam-Score, Mum-Glass and Dit Oar Casements and Windows, that now pay their Light; And all to the making Our Silver more Bright; Will Crown with full Glory our Shillings and Pence: For our Mint will Shine out a Hundred Years hence. XI. But now, without Rallying or Joque, lets agree, To pay our Great Caesar our Hand, Heart and Knee; The Heroe, whose Sword for our Liberty Draws, Who faces Blood, Danger, And Death in Our Cause; Some few Months, we hope, will his warm Beams dispe, And our Heirs Bless his Name a Hundred Years hence.
