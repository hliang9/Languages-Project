What you will. INDVCTION. Before the Musicke sounds for the Acte: Enter Atticus, Doricus, & Phylomuse, they sit a good while on the Stage before the Can∣dles are lighted, talking together, & on suddeine Doricus speakes. Enter Tier-man with lights. Dor. O Fie some lights, sirs fie, let there be no deeds of dark∣nesse done among vs.—I so, so, pree thee Tyer-man set Sineor Snuffe a fier, he's a chollerick Gentleman, he will take Pepper in the nose instantly, feare not, fore Heauen I wonder they tollerate him so nere the Stage. Phy. Faith Doricus, thy braine boiles, keele it, keele it, or all the fatt's in the fire: in the name of Phoebus, what merry Genius haunts thee to day, thy lips play with Feathers. Dor. Troth they should pick straws before they should be idle, Atti, But why, but why doost thou wonder they dare suffer Snuffe so neere the Stage? Dor. O well recald, marry Sir sineor Snuffe, Mounsieur Mew, and Caualiero Blirt, are three of the most to bee fear'd Auditors that euer— Phy. Pish for shame, stint thy idle chatte. Dor. Nay dreame what-so-ere your fantasie swimmes on Phylomuse, I protest in the loue you haue procured mee to beare your friend the Author, I am vehemently fearefull, this three∣fold halter of contempt that choakes the breath of witte, these aforesaid tria sunt omnia, Knights of the Meaw will sitt heauie on the skirtes of his Sceanes, if— Phy. If what? beleeue it Doricus his spirit, Is higher blouded then to quake and pant At the report of Skoffes Artillery; Shall he be creast-falne, if some looser braine, In flux of witte vnciuely befilth His slight composures? shall his bosome faint If drunken Censure belch out sower breath, From Hatreds surfet on his labours front? Nay say some halfe a dozen rancorous breasts Should plant them-selues on purpose to discharge
Impostum'd malice on his latest Sceane Shall his resolue be struck through with the blirt, Of a goose breath? What imperfect borne? What short liu'd Meteor? what cold harted Snow Would melt in dolor? cloud his mudded eyes Sinck downe his iawes, if that some iuicles husk Some boundlesse ignorance should on sudden shoote His grosse knob'd burbolt, with thats not so good, Mew, blirt, ha, ha, light Chaffy stuff? Why gentle spirits what loose wauing fane? What any thing would thus be skru'd about With each slight touch of od Phantasmatas? No let the feeble palseid lamer ioynts, Leane on opinions crutches, let the— Dor. Nay, nay, nay, Heauens my hope, I cannot smoth this straine, Witts death I cannot, what a leaprous humor Breaks from ranke swelling of these bubbling wits? Now out vp-pont: I wonder what tite braine: Wrung in this custome to mainetaine Contempt Gainst common Censure: to giue stiffe counter buffes To crack rude skorne euen on the very face Of better audience. Slight ist not odious, Why harke you honest, honest Phylomuse (You that indeauor to indeere our thoughts, To the composers spirit) hold this firme: Musike and Poetry were first approu'd By common scence; and that which pleased most, Held most allowed passe: not rules of Art Were shapt to pleasure, not pleasure to your rules, Thinke you if that his sceanes tooke stampe in mint Of three or foure deem'd most iuditious, It must inforce the world to currant them That you must spit defiance on dislike? Now as I loue the light were I to passe Through publick verdit, I should feare my forme Least ought I offerd were vnsquard or warp'd, " The more we know, the more we know we want " What Bayard boulder then the ignorant?
" Beleeue me Phylomuse: ifaith thou must " The best best seale of wit, is wits distrust. Phy. Nay gentle Doricus. Dor. Ile here no more of him, nay and your friend the Au∣thor, the composer: the What you will: seemes so faire in his owne glasse, so straight in his owne measure that hee talkes once of squinting Critickes, drunken Censure, splay-footed Opinion, iui∣cles huskes, I ha done with him, I ha done with him. Phy. Pew nay then — Dor. As if any such vnsanctified stuffe could finde a beeing monge these ingenuous breasts. Atti Come, let passe, let passe, lers see what stuffe must cloath our eares: what's the plaies name? Phy. What you will. Dor. 1st Commedy, Tragedy, Pastorall, Morall, Nocturnal or Historie. Phy. Faith perfectly neither, but euen What you will, a slight toye, lightly composed, to swiftly finisht, ill plotted, worse writ∣ten, I feare me worst acted, and indeed What you will. Dor. Why I like this vaine well now. At. Come, wee straine the spectators patience in delaying their expected delightes. Lets place our selues within the Cur∣taines, for good faith the Stage is so very little we shall wrong the generall eye els very much. Phy. If youle stay but a little Ile accompany you, I haue in∣gag'd my selfe to the Author to giue a kind of inductiue speech to his Commedy. At. Away: you neglect your selfe, a gentleman — Phy. Tut I haue vow'd it, I am double charg'd, go of as't twil, Ile set fire to it. Dor. Ile not stand it, may chance recoile, and be not stuff'd with salte-peeter, well marke the report, marke the report. Phy. Nay pree thee stay, slid the female presence; the Gente∣letza; the women will put me out. Dor. And they striue to put thee out, doe thou indeuor to put them. Atti. In good faith if they put thee out of countenance; put thou them out of patience; & hew their eares with hacking im∣perfect vtterance.
Dor. Goe stand to it, shew thy selfe a tale man of thy tongue, make an honest legge, put off thy Cap with discreete carriage: and so we leaue thee to the kinde Gentlemen, and most respec∣ted Auditors. Exeunt, remanet tantum Phylomusus. PROLOGVS. NOR labours hee the fauor of the rude, Nor offers sops vnto the Stigian Dogge To force a scilence in his viperous toungs: Nor cares he to insinuate the grace, Of loath'd detraction, nor persues the loue Of the nice Criticks of this squeamish age, Nor striues he to beare vp with euery saile Of floting Censure: nor once dreads or care's What enuious hand his guiltles Muse hath struck, " Sweet breath from tainted stomacks who can suck: But to the faire proportion'd loues of witte, To the iust skale of euen paized thoughts: To those that know the pangs of bringing forth A perfect feature: to their gentle mindes, That can as soone slight of, as finde a blemish, To those as vmbly lowe as to their feete I am oblig'd to bend: to those his Muse, Makes solemne honour, for their wish'd delight: He vowes industrious sweat shall pale his cheeke, But heele glose vp sleeke obiects for their eyes: For those he is asham'd, his best's too badd, A silly subiect too too simply cladd Is all his present, all his ready pay, For many many debts. Giue further day Ile giue a Prouerbe, Sufferance giueth ease: So you may once be pai'd, we once may please. Exit.
ACT. 1. SCAE. 1. Enter Quadratus, Phylus following him with a lute, a Page going before Quadratus with a torch. Phy. O O I beseech you Sir reclaime his wits, My masters mad, starke mad, alasse for loue, Qua. For loue? nay and he be not mad for hate, Tis amiable fortune; I tell thee youth Right rare and geason: strang? mad for loue, O show me him Ile giue him reasons straight. So forcible so all inuincible, That it shall drag loue out: run mad for loue? What mortally exsistes, on which our hearts Should be inamored with such passion? For loue? come Phylus; come Ile haung his fate, In steed of loue Ile make him mad for hate. But troth say what straines his madnesse of? Phy. Phantasticall. Qua. Immure him, skonce him, barrecadoe him int, Phantasticall mad, thrice blessed heart; Why harke good Phylus: (o that thy narrow sence, Could but containe me now) all that exsists, Takes valuation from oppinion: A giddy minion now: pish, thy tast is dull, And canst not rellish me, come wher's Iacomo. Enter Iacomo vnbraced and careles drest' Phy. Looke where he coms: O map of boundles wo! Iaco. You gleame is day, darknes, sleepe and feare, Dreames, and the vgly visions of the night Are beate to hell by the bright palme of light, Now romes the swaine and whissells vp the morne: Deepe Silence breakes: all things start vp with light, Only my hart, that endles night and day, Lies bed-red, crippeld by coy Lucea, Qua. There's a straine law.
Nay now I seee hee's madde most palpable, He speakes like a player, hah! poeticall. Iaco. The wanton spring lyes dallying with the earth, And powers fresh bloud in her decayed vaines, Looke how the new sapt branches are in childe With tender infants, how the Sunne drawes out, And shapes their moysture into thousand formes Of sprouting buddes, all things that show or breath, Are now instaur'd, sauing my wretched brest, That is eternally congeald with Ice Of froz'd, dispaire. O Celia, coy, to nice. Qua. Still saunce question mad? Iaco. O where doth Piety and Pitty rest? Qua. Fetch cordes he's irrecouerable, mad, ranke madde, He calls for strange Chymeras, fictions That haue no being since the curse of death Was throwne on man: Pitty and Piety, Whole daine conuerse with them? alas vaine head, Pitty and Piety are long since dead. Iaco. Ruine to Chaunce, and all that striue to stand, Like swolne Colosses on her tottering Base. Fortune is blinde— Qua. You lye, you lye, None but a mad man would terme Fortune blind, How can shee see to wound desert so right? Iust in the speeding place: to girt leud browes With honord wreath; ha? Fortune blinde? away, How can she hud-winkt then so rightly see, To starue rich worth and glut iniquitie? Iaco. O Loue! Qua. Loue? hang loue, It is the abiect out-cast of the world, Hate all things, hate the world, thy selfe, all men, Hate knowledge, striue not to be ouer-wise, ,,It drew distruction into Paradise, Hate Honor, Vertue, they are baites, That tice mens hopes to sadder fates, Hate beautie, euery ballad-monger,
Can cry his idle soppish humor Hate riches, wealthes a flattering Iacke, A dors to face, mewes hind thy backe. He that is poore is firmely sped, He neuer shall be flattered▪ All thinges are error, durt and nothing, Or pant with want or gorg'd to lothing, Loue onely hate, affect no higher Then praise of heauen, wine, a fire. Suck vp thy daies in silent breath, When their snuffs out come Sinior death. Now Sir adieu runne mad and twilt, The worst is this my rimes but spilt. Iaco Thy rimes are spilt who would not run ranke mad, To see a wandring French man riuall, nay Out-strip my sute. He kist my Celias cheeke, Qua. Why man I saw my dog euen kisse thy Celias lippes, Iaco. To morrow morne they goe to wed, Qua. Well then I know. Whether to morrow night they goe. Iaco. Say quick. Qua To bed Iaco. I will inuoke the triple Heccate, Make charmes as potent as the breath of Fate, But Ile confound the match, Qua Nay then good day, And you be coniuring once Ile slink away, Exit Quadratus. Iaco. Boy could not Orpheus make the stones to daunce? Phy, Yes Sir. Iaco. Bir Lady a sweete touch: did he not bring Euridice out of hell with his lute. Phy So they say Sir, Iaco. And thou chanst bring Celias head out of the window with thy Lute, well hazard thy breath: looke Sir heares a ditty. Tis fouly writ slight wit cross'd here and there, But where thou findst a blot, their fall a teare. The Song. Fie peace, peace, peace, it hath no passion int.
O melt thy breath in fluent softer tunes That euery note may seeme to tricle downe Like sad distilling teares and make: O God That I were but a Poet now t'expresse my thoughts Or a Musitian but to sing my thoughts Or any thing but what I am, sing't ore once more My greefes a boundles sea that hath no shore. Hee Singes and is answered, from aboue a Willow garland is floung downe and the songe ceaseth. Is this my fauor? am I crown'd with skorne? Then thus I manumit my slau'd condition. Celia but heare me execrate thy loue. By heauen that once was consious of my loue By all that is that knowes my all was thine I will perseu with detestation. Thawart without stretched vehemence of hate Thy wished Hymen: I will craze my braine But all disceauer all: thy hopes vnite What rage so violent as loue turn'd spight? Enter Randolfo and Andrea with a supplication reading. Ra. Humbly complayning kissing the hands of your excelence your pore orators Randolfo and Andrea beseecheth forbidding of the dis∣honord match of their Neece Celia Widdow to their Brother— O twill do, twill do, it can not chuse but doe. And What should one say what should one do now; vmph If she do match with you same wandring knight Shee's but vndone, her estimation, wealth — Iaco. Nay sir her estimations mounted vp She shall be Ladi'd and sweete Madam'd now. Ran. Be Ladi'd ha, ha, O could she but recaule The honord Port of her deceased loue; But thinke whose wife she was, God wot no knights But one (that title of) was euen a Prince A Sultane Sollyman: thrice was he made In dangerous armes Venice prouidetore. An. He was a Marchant, but so bounteous Valiant, wise, learned, all so absolute That naughts, was valewed praisfull excellent
But in it was he most praisfull excellent. Iaco. O I shall nere forget how he went cloath'd He would maintaine't a base ill vs'd fashion To bind a Marchant to the sullen habit Of precise black, cheefly in Venice state. Where Marchants guilt the top And therefore should you haue him passe the bridge Vp the Rialto like a soldier (As still hee stood a Potestate at sea) Ran. In a black beuer felt, ash colour plaine A Florentine cloth of siluer Ierkin, sleeues White satten cut on tinsell, then long stocke. Iaco. French paines imbroder'd, Gold-smithes worke, O God! Me thinkes I see him now how he would walke: With what a iolly presence he would pace Round the Rialto. Well hee's soone forgot A straggling sir in his rich bed must sleepe Which if I can not crosse▪ Ile curse and weepe. Shall I be plaine as Truth, I loue your Sister My education birth and wealth deserues her I haue no crosse, no rub to stop my sute But Lauardur's a knight, that strikes all mute. An. I ther's the diuill, she must be Ladi'd now. Iaco. O ill nurs'd custome no soner is the wealthy Marchant dead His wife left great in faire possessions But giddie rumor graspes it twixt his teeth And shakes it bout our eares. Then thether flock A rout of crased fortunes whose crakt states Gape to be sodderd vp by the rich masse Of the deceased labores, and now and then The troupe of I beseech and I protest And beleeue it sweete, is mix'd with too or three Hopefull, well stockt, neat clothed Cytizens Ran. But as we see the sonne of a Diuine Seldome proues Preacher, or a Lawiers sonne Rarely a pleader, (for they striue to Run A various fortune from their Auncestors) So tis right geason for the Marchantes widow,
To be the Cytizens lou'd second spouse. Iaco. Variety of obiectes please vs still One dish though nere so cookt doth quickly fill. When diuerse cates the pallats scence delight And with fresh fast creates new appetite Therefore my widdow she casheers the blackes For sweares turnes of the furd-gownes, and suruaies The bedrowle of her sutors thinkes and thinkes, And straight her questing thoughts springs vp a knight, Haue after then a maine the gam's a foote The match clapt vp, tut tis the knight must do't. Ran. Then must my pretty peate be Fan'd and Coach'd. Iaco Muffd Mask'd and Ladied, with my more then most sweete Madam, But how long doth this perfume of sweete Madam last? Faith tis but a wash sent. My Riotous sir Beginnes to crack Gestes on his Ladies front, Touches her new stampt gentry, takes a glut Keepes out, abandons home, and spends and spends Till stock be melted, then sir takes vp heere Takes vp there, till no where ought is left. Then for the Low-countries, hay for the French And so (to make vp rime) god night sweete wench. Ran. By blessednesse weele stop this fatall lot. Iaco. But how▪ but how? Ran. Why stay lets thinke a plot. An. Was not Albano Beletzo honorable rich? Ran. Not peer'd in Venice, for birth, fortune loue. An. Tis skarce three monthes since fortune gaue him dead. Ran. In the blacke fight in the Venetian gulfe. An. You hold a truth. Ran. Now what a gigglet is this Celia? An. To match so suddaine so vnworthely? Ran. Why she might haue — An. Who might not Celia haue? The passionate mamord Iacomo. Iaco. The passionate mamord Iacomo. An. Of honord linage, and not meanly rich.
Ran. The sprightfull Piso, the great Florentine, Aurelius Tuber. And. And to leaue these all, And wed a wandring Knight Sir Lauerdure, A God knowes what? Ran. Brother she shall not, shal our blood be moungreld with the corruption of a stragling French? And. Saint Marke she shall not, Iaco. She shall not fathers by; our brother soules. Ran. Good day. Iaco. Wish me good day? it stands in idle stead, My Celias lost, all my good daies are dead. The Cornets sound a florish. Harke Lorenzo Celso the loose Venice Duke, Is going to bed▪ tis now a forward morne Fore he take rest. O strange transformed sight, When Princes make night day the day there night. And Come weele peticion him, Iaco. Away away, He skornes all plaints makes iest of serious sute. Ran. Fall out as't twill I am resolued to do't. The Cornets sound. Enter the Duke coppled with a Lady, two cooples more with them, the men hauing tobacco pipes in their hands, the woemen sitt, they daunce a round. The Petition is deliuered vp by Ran∣dolfo, the Duke lightes his tobacco pipe with it and goes out dauncing. Ran. Saint Marke Saint Marke. Iaco. Did not I tell you, loose no more rich time, What can one get but mier from a swine? And. Lets worke a crosse, weele fame it all aboute The French mans gelded. Ran. O thats absolute. Iaco. Fie ont away, she knowes to well tis false, I feare it to well. No no I hau't will strongly doe't, Who knowes Francisco Soranza? Ran. Pish, pish, why what of him? Iaco. Is he not wondrous like your decea'sd kinsman Albano.
And. Exceedingly the strangest neerly like In voice, in gesture face in— Ran. Nay he hath Albanos imperfection too, And stuttes when he is vehemently mou'd. Iaco. Obserue me then, him would I haue disguis'd, Most perfect like Albano: giuing out, Albano sau'd by swimming (as in faith 'Tis knowne he swome most strangely) rumor him, This morne arriu'd in Venice, heere to lurke As hauing heard the for-ward Nuptials, T'obserue his wifes most infamous lewd hast And to reuenge— Ran. I hau't, I hau't, I hau't, 'twill be inuincible. Iaco. By this meanes now some little time we catch, For better hopes at least disturbe the match. And. Ile to Francisco. Ran. Brother Adrian You haue our brothers picture, shape him to it. And. Precise in each but Tassell, feare it not. Ran. Saint Marke then prosper once, our hopefull plot. Iaco. Good soules, good day, I haue not slept last night, Ile take a nap, then pell mell broach all spight. Exeunt. ACTVS 2. SCENA. 1.

But O to marke you thing Sweate to vnite acquaintance to his friend, Labour his praises and indeere his worth With titles all as formally trickt forth, As the Cap of a Dedicatorie Epistle, Then sir to view Lampatho, he protests, Protests and vowes, such suddeine heate of loue, That O twere warmth inough of mirth to drie, The stintlesse teares of old Heraclitus Make Nyobe to laugh.

No sir should discreete Mastigophoros Or the deere spirit acute Canaidus (That Aretine; that most of me belou'd Who in the rich esteeme I prize his soule I terme my selfe) should these once menace me Or curbe, my humors with well gouern'd check I should with most industrious regard, Obserue abstaine, and curbe my skipping lightnesse But when an arrogant od impudent, A blushles fore-head only out of scence.

I can not tell, tis now growne fashion, Whats out of railyng's out of fashion: A man can skarce put on a tuckt vp cap A button'd frizado sute, skarce eate good meate, Anchoues, cauiare, but hee's Satyred And term'd Phantasticall: by the muddy spawne Of slymie Neughtes, when troth, Phantasticknesse, That which the naturall Sophysters tearme Phantusia incomplexa, is a function Euen of the bright immortal part of man. It is the common passe, the sacred dore, Vnto the priue chamber of the soule That bar'd nought passeth past the baser Court: Of outward scence by it th'inamorate, Most liuely thinkes he sees the absent beauties Of his lou'd mistres. By it we shape a new creation, Of things as yet vnborne, by it wee feede:

When thou hast meanes be Phantasticall and sociable; goe to, heres my hand and you want fortie shillings I am your Maecenas though not Atauis Edite regibus. Lam. Why content and I protest— Qua. Ile no protest. Lam. Well and I doe not leaue these fopperies doe not lend me fortie shillings, & ther's my hand, I imbrace you, loue you, nay adore thee, for by the iuice of worm-woode, thou hast a
bitter braine. Qu. You Simplicius? woult leaue that staring fellow Admiratiō, and Adoration of thy acquaintance wilt. A skorne out tis odi∣ous, too eager a defence argues a strong opposition, & to vehe∣ment a praise, drawes a suspition of others worthy disparige∣ment. Set tapers to bright day, it ill befittes Good wines can vent themselues, and not good wittes. Sym. Good truth I loue you, and with the grace of Heauen, Ile be very ciuell and — Qua. Phantasticall.

They are mine owne, no gleaned Poetry, My fashions knowne, out rime takt as you list: A fico, for the sower browd Zoilist. Musick, Tobacco, Sack and Sleepe, The tide of Sorrow backward keepe.
If thou art sad at others fate, Riuo drinke deepe giue care the mate, On vs the end of time is come, Fond feare of that we cannot shun, Whilst quickest sence doth freshly last, Clip time aboute, hug pleasure fast. The Sisters rauell out our twine, He that knows littl's most deuine. Error deludes; whole beate this hence, Naughtes knowne but by exterior sence, Let glory blason others deede, My bloud then breath craues better meede, Let twattling fame cheatd others rest, I am no dish for Rumors feast. Let honor others hope abuse, Ile nothing haue so nought will loose: Ile striue to be nor great nor smale, To liue nor die, fate helmeth all, When I can breath no longer then, Heauen take all, there put Amen. How ist, how ist? Lau. Faith so, so, telamant, quelamant, as't please Oppinion to currant it. Qua. Why then via letts walke, Lau. I must giue notice to an od pedant as wee passe of my nuptials, I vse him for he is abscure and shal marry vs in priuate, I haue many enemies but secresie is the best euasion from enuie. Qua Holds it to morrow? Lau. I firme absolute, Lam. Ile say amen if the Priest be mute. Qua. Epythalamiums will I singe my chucke, Go on, spend freely, out on drosse tis muck. Exeunt

Things onely fleshly sencitiue, an Oxe or Horse, They liue and eate, and sleepe, and drinke, and die And are not toucht with recollections Of things ore-past or staggerd infant doubtes Of things succeeding: but leaue the manly beastes, And giue but pence a peece to haue a sight: Of beastly man now. Sym. What so Lampatho, good truth I will not pay your Or∣dinary if you come not. Lam. Dost thou heare that voice.

Hippo water, Anaximenes ayre, Aristoxenus Musicke; Critias I know not what, A company of odde phrenetici Did eate my youth, and when I crept abroad, Finding my numnesse in this nimble age, I fell a railing, but now soft and slow, I know, I know naught, but I naught do know, What shall I doe, what plot, what course persew? Qua. Why turne a Temporist, row with the tide, Pursew the cut, the fashion of the age, Well heer's my Schollers course, first get a Schoole, And then a ten-pound Cure, keepe both, then buy, (Stay marry, I marry) then a farme or so, Serue God and Mammon, to the Diuill goe, Affect some sect, I 'tis the sect is it, So thou canst seeme 'tis held the pretious wit: And O if thou canst get some higher seate, Where thou maist sell your holy portion, (Which charitable prouidence ordained In sacred bountie for a blessed vse) Alien the gleabe, intaile it to thy loines, Intombe it in thy graue Past resurrection to his natiue vse.

Well my sceane is long. All within. Quadratus. Qua.

Adrean his doublet and band, Randolfo his cloake and staffe▪ they cloath Francisco, whilst Bydet creepes in and obserues them. Much of of this done whilst the Acte is playing. Fran. For God-sake remember to take speciall markes of me, or you will nere be able to know me. Adri. Why man? Fra. Why good faith I scarce know my selfe already me thinks I should remember to forget my selfe, now I am so shining braue. Indeed Francisco was alwayes a sweete youth, for I am a Persumer, but thus braue? I am an alien to it, would you make mee like the drownd Albano, must I bear't mainly vp, must I bee hee. Ran. What els man? O what else? Iaco. I warrant you giue him but faire riche cloathes, Hee can bee tane, reputed any thing, Apparail's growne a God and goes more neate, Makes men of ragges, which straight he beares aloft, Like patcht vp scar-Crowes to affright the rout Of the Idolatrous vulgar, that worship Images,
Stand aw'd and bare-skalp't at the glosse of silkes, Which like the glorious Aiax of Lincolnes Inne, (Suruai'd with wonder by me when I lay, Factor in London:) lappes vp naught but filth And excrements, that beare the shape of men, Whose in-side euery day would peck and teare, But that vaine skar-crow cloathes intreates forbeare. Fran, You would haue me take vpon me Albano, A valiant gallant Venetian Burgomasco, Well my beard, my feather, short sword and my oth Shall doo't feare not. What I know a number By the sole warrant of a Lapy-beard, A raine beate plume, and a good chop filling oth, With an odde French shrugge, and by the Lotd or so, Ha leapt into sweete Captaine with such ease, As you would-feart not, Ile gage my heart Ile do't, How sits my Hat, ha, Iack doth my feather wagge. Iaco. Me thinkes now in the common sence of fashion, Thou shouldst grow proud, and like a fore-horse view, None but before-hand gallants, as for sides▪ And those that ranke in equall file with thee, Studdy a faint salute, giue a strange eye, But as to those in rere-ward O be blind, The world wants eyes, it cannot see behind. Fran. Where is the strumpet, where's the hot vain'd French, Liues not Albano, hath Celia so forgot, Albanos loue, that she must forth-with wed, A runne-about▪ a skipping French-man— Iaco. Now you must grow in heate and stut. Fran. An odde phantasma, a beggar, a Sir, a who who who what you will, a straggling go go go gunds, f f f f fut— Adrian. Passing like him, passing like him, O 'twill strike all dead. Pan. I am rauished 'twill be peerles exquisite, Let him go out instantly. Iaco. O not till twy-light, meane time Ile prop vp The tottering Rumor of Albanos skape. And safe arriuall, it begins to spread,
If this plot liue Frenchman thy hopes are dead. Exeunt. Bydet. And if it liue strike of this little head. Exit. Enter Albano with Slip his Page. Alba. Can it be? ist possible? ist within the bounds of faith? O vilany. Slip The clapper of Rumor strikes on both sides ringing out the French knight is in firme possessiō of my Misteris your wife. Alba. Ist possible I should be dead so soone? In her affectes, how long ist since our shipprack? Slip. Faith I haue little arithmatique in me, yet I remember the storme made mee cast vp perfectly the whole sum of all I had receiu'd, three daies before I was liquord soundly my guts were rinc'd for the heauens: I looke as pale euer since as if I had tane the diet this spring. Alba. But how long ist since our ship-wrack? Slip. Mary since wee were hung by the heeles on the batch of Cycily to make a iayle deliuery of the sea in our mawes tis iust three monthes: shall I speake like a Poet? Thrice hath the horned mone. Alba. Talke not of hornes. O Celia how oft (When thou hast lay'd thy cheeke vppon my breast And with laciuious petulancy sew'd. For Hymeneall dalliance marriage rightes) O then how oft with passionate protestes And zealous vowes hast thou oblig'd thy loue, In dateles bands vnto Albanos breast? Then did I but mention second Marriage With what a bitter hate would she inuaigh Gainst retaild wedlockes. O would she lispe If you should die, (then would she slide a teare, And with a wanton languishment in-twist Her hands) O God and you should die. Marry? Could I loue life; my deare Albano dead Should any Prince possesse his widdowes bed? And now see, see, I am but rumord drown'd. Slip. Sheele make you Prince, your worship must be crown'd O master you know the woman is the weaker creature,
She must haue a prop: the maide is the brittle mettell Her head is quickly crackt: the wife is queasie stomackt She must be fed with nouelties; but then whats your widdowe, Custome is a second nature, I say no more but think you the rest. Alba. If loue be holy, if that mistery, Of co-vnited hearts be sacrament? If the vnbounded goodnesse haue infus'd. A sacred ardor if a mutuall loue Into our Speties, of those amorous ioyes, Those sweetes of life, those comfortes euen in death Spring from a cause aboue our reasones reach? If that cleere flame deduce his heate from heauen? Tis like his cause's eternall alwaies one As is th' instiller of deuinest loue Vnchangd by time immortall mauger death. But O tis growne a figment: loue a iest: A commick Poesie: the soule of man is rotten Euen to the core no sound affection. Our loue is hollow vaulted, stands on proppes, Of circumstance, profit or ambitious hopes. The other tissue Gowne or Chaine of pearle Makes my coy minx to nussell twixt the breastes Of her lull'd husband, tother Carkanet, Deflowres that Ladies bed: one hundred more Marries that loath'd blowze, one ten pound oddes In promis'd ioynture makes the hard palm'd sire, Inforce his daughters tender lippes to start At the sharpe touch of some loath'd stubbed beard, The first pure time the golden age is fled, Heauen knowes I lie tis now the age of gold, For it all marreth and euen virtues sold. Slip. Master will you trust me and Ile. Alba Yes boy Ile trust thee, babes & fooles ile trust But seruants faith, wiues loue, or femalls lust, A vsurer and the diuill sooner. Now were I dead, Me thinkes I see a huff-cap swaggering sir, Pawning my plate, my iewells, morgage? Nay Selling out right the purchace of my browes,
Whilst my poore fatherlesse leane totterd sonne, My gentries reliques, my houses onely prop, Is saw'd a sunder, lyes forlorne, all bleake, Vnto the griefes of sharpe Necessities, Whilst his father in law, his father in Diuell, or d d d d Diuill, f f f father, Or who who who who; What you will, When is the marriage morne? Slip. Euen next rising sonne. Alba. Good, good, good, go to my brother Adrian, Tell him Ile lurck, stay, tell him Ile lurck, stay, Now is Albanos marriage bed new hung With fresh rich Curtaines, now are my valence vp, Imbost with orient Pearle, my Gransires gift, Now are the Lawne sheetes fum'd with Vyolets, To fresh the pawld lasciuious appetite, Now worke the Cookes, the pastry sweates with slaues, The March-panes glitter, now now the musitions Houer with nimble stickes ore squeaking crowds, Ticling the dryed guttes of a Mewing Catt, The Taylors, Starchers, Semsters, Butchers, Pulterors, Mercers, all, all, all, now now now, none thinke a mee, the f f f French is te f f f fine man, de p p p pock man, de— Slip.

Bydet. Our selfe will giue them their charge, Now let mee stroake my beard and I had it, & speake wisely if I knew how: most vnconsionable, honest little, or little honest good subiects, informe our person of your seuerall qualities and of the pre∣iudice that is foisted vppon you that our selfe may peruew, pre∣uent, and preoccupie the pustulent dangers incident to all your cases. Doit. Here is a petition exhibited of the particuler greeuan∣ces of each sort of pages. Bydet. We will vouchsafe in this our publike session to per∣use them, pleaseth your excellent wagship to bee informed that the deuision of pages is tripartite (tripartite) or three fold, of pages, some be Court pages, others Ordinary gallants pages, & the third-apple squiers, basket-bearers or pages of the placket, with the last we will proceede first, stand forth page of the plac∣ket, what is your mistres? Slip. A kinde of puritane. Byd. How liue you? Slip. Miserably cōplayning to your crack-ship though we haue light Mistresses we are made the Children and seruants of dark∣nes, what prophane vse we are put to, al these gallants more fee∣lingly know then we can liuely expresse, it is to be comiserated
and by your royall insight onely to bee preuented that a male Mounkey and the diminutiue of a man should bee Synonima & no scence. Though wee are the drosse of your subiects, yet be∣ing a kinde of page, let vs finde your Celsitude kind and respec∣tiue of our time-fortunes and birthes abuse, and so in the name of our whole tribe of emptie basket-bearers, I kisse your little hands. Bidet. Your case is dangerous and almost desperat stand forth ordinary gallants page, what is the nature of your Master? Noose. He eates well and right slouenly, and when the dice fauor him goes in good cloathes, and scowers his pinke collour silk stockings: whē he hath any mony he beares his crownes, whē he hath none I carry his purse, he cheates well, sweares better, but swaggers in a wantons Chamber admirably, hee loues his boy and the rump of a cram'd Capon, and this summer hath a passing thrifty humor to bottle ale: as contemptuous as Lucifer, as arrogant as ignorāce can make him, as libidinous as Priapus, hee keepes mee as his adamant to draw mettell after to his lodging, I curle his perriwig, painte his cheekes, perfume his breath, I am his froterer or rubber in a Hot-house, the prop of his lies, the bearer of his fals dice, and yet for all this like the Persian Louse that eates byting, and byting eates, so I say si∣thing and sithing say my end is to paste vp a Si quis my Masters fortunes are forc'd to cashere me and so six to one I fall to be a Pippin squire. Hic finis priami, this is the end of pick pockets. Bydet. Stand forth Court-page, thou lokest pale and wan. Trip. Most ridiculous Emperor. Bydet. O say no more, I know thy miseryes, what betwixt thy Lady, her Gentlewoman and thy Masters late gaming thou maist looke pale. I know thy miseries and I condole thy calami∣ties, thou art borne well, bred ill, but diest worst of al, thy bloud most commonly gentle, thy youth ordinaryly idle, and thy age to often miserable. When thy first sute is fresh, thy cheekes cleere of Court soiles, and thy Lord falne out with his Lady, so longe may be heele chuck thee vnder the chin, call thee good pretty ape and giue thee a scrap from his owne trencher, but after he neuer beholds thee, but when thou squierst him with a torch to a wantons sheetes, or lightes his Tobacco pipe. Neuer
vseth thee but as his pander neuer, regardeth thee but as an idle bur that stickst vpon the nap of his fortune, and so naked thou camst into the world and naked thou must returne; whom serue you. Holy. A foole. Bydet. Thou art my happiest subiect, the seruice of a foole is the onely blessedst slauery that euer put on a chaine and a blew cote, they know not what nor for what they giue, but so they giue tis good, so it be good they giue: fortunes are ordain'd for fooles, as fooles are for fortune, to play with all not to vse, hath hee taken an oth of alleagiance is hee of our brother∣hood yet? Holy. Not yet right venerable Honorificac cac cac cacuminos Bidet: but as little an infant as I am I will, and with the grace of wit I will deserue it. Bydet. You must performe a valorous Vertuous, and religi∣ous exploit first in desert of your order. Holyf. What ist? Byd. Couzen thy master, hee is a foole, and was created for men of wit such as thy selfe to make vse of. Holy. Such as my selfe. Nay faith for wit I think for my age or so, but on, sir. Bidet. That thou maist the easier purge him of superfluous bloud I will discribe thy Maisters constitution, he loues and is beloued of himselfe and one more; his dog. There is a company of vnbrac'd vntrussd, rutters in the towne, that crinkle in the hammes swearing their flesh is their onely lyuing, and when they haue any crownes, cry god a marcy Mol, and shrugging let the Cockholds pay fort: intimating that their maintenance flowes from the wantonnesse of Merchants wiues, when introth the plaine troth is, the plaine and the stand, or the plaine stand and deliuer, deliuers them all their lyuing. These comrades haue perswaded thy Maister that ther's no way to redeeme his peach collour satten sute from pawne but by the loue of a Cyti∣zens wife, hee beleeues it, they slout him he feedes them, and now tis our honest and religious meditation that hee feede vs.
Holyfernes Puppi. Holy. Pippo and shall please you. Bydet. Pippo tis our will and pleasure thou sute thy selfe like a Marchants wife, leaue the managing of the sequence vnto our prudence. Holy. Or vnto our Prudence truly shee is a very witty wench and hath a stammell petticote with three gards for the nonce; but for your Marchants wife alas I am to little, speake to small, go to gingerly, by my troth I feare I shall looke to faire. Bydet. Our maiesty dismounteth, and wee put of our great∣nesse, and now my little knaues I am plaine Crack, as I am Bos∣phoros Carmelidon Honorificacuminos Bydet I am imperious: ho∣nor sparckles in mine eyes; but as I am Crack I wil conuay cros∣bite and cheat vpon Simplicius, I will feed, satiat and fill your panches: replenish, stuff or furnish your purses, wee will laugh when others weepe, sing when others sith, feede when others starue, and be drunke when others are sober, this my charge at the loose, as you loue our brother-hood, auoide true speech square dice, small liquor, and aboue all, those to vngentleman∣like protestations of indeede and verely, and so gentle Appollo touch thy nimble string our sceane is donne yet fore wee cease wee sing.

How pree-thee in a play? come, come, be sosiable In priuate seuerance from societie, Here leapes a vaine of bloud inflam'd with loue, Mounting to pleasure, all adict to mirth, Thoult read a Satyre or a Sonnet now, Clagging their ayery humor with— Lam. Lamp oyle, watch Candles, Rug-gownes & small iuice, Thin commons, foure a clock rising, I renounce you all, Now may I ternally abandon meat Rust fustie you which most imbrac'd disuse, You a made me an Asse, thus shapt my lot, I am a meere Scholler, that is a meere sot. Qua. Come then Lampe, ile powre fresh Oyle into thee, Apply thy spirit that it may nimbly turne, Vnto the habit, fashion of the age, Ile make thee man the Scholler, inable thy behauiour, Apt for the intertaine of any presence: Ile turne thee gallant, first thou shalt haue a Mistresse, How is thy spirit rais'd to yonder beauty? She with the sanguine cheeke, the dimpled chinne, The pretty amorous smile that clips her lips, And dallyes bought her cheeke— Shee with the speaking eye, That castes out beames as ardent as those flakes, Which sing'd the world by rash braind Phaeton, She with the lip, O lips! she for whose sake, A man could finde in his heart to in-hell himselfe, There's more Philosophy, more theoremes, More demonstrations, all inuincible, More cleare diuinity drawne on her cheeke,
Then in all volumes tedious paraphase, Of musty eld, O who would staggering doubt, The soules eternity, seeing it hath Of heauenly beauty, but to case it vp, Who would distrust a supreame existence, Able to confound when it can creale, Such heauen on earth able to intrance, Amaze: O I 'tis prouidence, not chance. Lam. Now by the front of Ioue me thinks her eye Shootes more spirit in me, O beautie feminine! How powerfull art thou, what deepe magick lyes Within the circle of thy speaking eyes. Qua. Why now could I eate thee, thou doost please mine ap∣petite, I can disist thee, God made thee a good foole, and happy and ignorant, and amarous, and riche and fraile, and a Satyrist, and an Essayest, and sleepy, and proud, and indeed a foole and then thou shalt bee sure of all these. Doe but scorne her shee is thine owne, accost her carelesly, and her eye promiseth shee will be bound to the good abbearing. Celia. Now sister Meletza doost marke their craft, some strag∣gling thoughts transport thy attentiuenesse from his discourse, wast Iacomos or our brothers plot? Lauer. Both, both, sweete Lady, my Page heard all, we mette the roague, so like Albano, I beat the roague. Sim. I but when you were gone the roague beat me. Lau. Now take my counsell, listen. Melet. A pretty youth, a pretty well shapt youth, a good leg, a very good eye, a sweete ingenious face, and I warrant a good witte, nay which is more, if hee bee poore I assure my soule hee is chaste and honest, good faith I fancy, I fancie him, I and I may chance, well Ile thinke the rest. Qua. I say bee carelesse still, court her without complement take spirit. Lauer. Wert not a pleasing ieast for me to cloath Another rascall like Albano, say And rumor him return'd without all deceit,
Would not beget errors most ridiculous. Qua. Meletza bella belletza, Madonna, bella bella genteletza pree-thee kisse this initiated gallant. Melet. How would it please you I should respect yee. Lamp. As any thing, What you will as nothing. Melet. As nothing, how will you valew my loue. Lamp. Why iust as you respect me, as nothing, for out of no∣thing, nothing is bred, so nothing shall not beget any-thing, any-thing bring nothing, nothing bring any-thing, any-thing & nothing shal be What you will, my speach mounting to the valieu of my selfe which is. Melet. What sweete— Lamp. Your nothing light as your selfe scencelesse as your sex, and iust as you would ha me, nothing. Melet.

Beleeue it youth slow speech, swift loue doth often shrowd. Lamp. My soul's intranc'd your fauor doth transport, My scence past scence, by your adored graces, I doat, am rapt. Melet. Nay if you fall to passion and past scence, My breasts no harbor for your loue, go packe, hence. Qua. Vds fut thou gull, thou inkie scholler, ha, thou whore∣son fop, Wilt not thou clappe into our fashion'd gallantry, Couldst not be proud and skornfull, loofe and vaine Gods my hearts obiect, what a plague is this: My soul's intraunc'd, fut couldst not clip and kisse, My soul's intraunc'd, ten thousand crownes at least Lost lost, my soul's intraunc'd, loues life O beast!

Still these same bauling pipes, sound softer straines Slumber our scence, tut these are vulger straines, Cannot your trembling wiers throw a chaine Of powerfull rapture bout our mazed scence Why is our chaire thus cushion'd tapistry Why is our bed tired with wanton sportes? Why are we cloath'd in glistring attiers, If common bloudes can heare, can, feele, Can sit as soft, lie as lasciuious Stut all as rich as the greatest Potentate, Soule, and you cannot feast my thrifting eares With aught but what the lip of common berth can tast, Take all away your labors idly wast What sport for night.

Cato grantes that I am sure, for he was valiant, and ho∣nest, which an Epicure nere was, and a coward neuer will be. Qua. Then Cato holdes a distinct notion, Of indiuiduall actions after death: This being argu'd his resolue maintaines, A true magnanimous spirit should giue vp durt To durt, and with his owne flesh dead his flesh, Fore chance should force it crouch vnto his foe: To kill ones selfe some I, some hold it no, O these are pointes would intice away ones soule: To breakes indenture of base prentisage, Enter Francisco.

Exeunt. Deo op:  gratias. FINIS.
