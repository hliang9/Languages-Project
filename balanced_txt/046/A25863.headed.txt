AN ACCOUNT Of the Produce of The Glass-Duty. BY the Commissioners Account for Receiving the said Duties, the Gross Duty appears, from Michaelmas, 1695, to the Seventeenth of November, 1696, to be l. 17642 s. 1 d. 5 Out of which must be Deducted, For Charges of Collecting the Duty as by their own Account— l. 2766 s. 3 d. 4   For Debentures at London, according to the Commissioners of the Customhouse's Account l. 840 s. 5 d. 8   For Debentures at Bristol, according to the said Commissioners Account— l. 2976 s. 0 d. 0   For Debentures at New Castle and Sheels— l. 1020 s. 0 d. 0   For prompt Payment allowed by the Com∣missioners of Glass-Duties Account l. 167 s. 4 d. 1     l. 7769 s. 13 d. 1     l. 9872 s. 8 d. 4 And out of the above-said Sum will be drawn back for Glass that will be Exported out of the Stock now on the Makers Hands, which hath paid the Duty, and is included in the above-said Sum at least 700 l. and with an Addition of 10000 dozen of Bottles more to be made, which will pay but 500 l. to the Crown, will answer all Demands for Glass un∣til Lady-day next; so that adding the 500 l. to the above 9872 l. 8 s. 4 d. and then deducting 700 l. for the Glass that will be Shipt off; and also 1000 l.for the Charge of Collecting from the 17 of November last, to Lady-day next, there will remain but 8672 l. 8 s. 4 d. for a Year and a half. Which for One Year is but 5781 l. 12 s. 3 d. Which Sum of 5781 l. 12 s. 3 d. is more then any following year can be supposed to produce. In as much as it had not been possible for the Glass Masters to have worked so long as they have, had it not been, that they had the oppor∣tunity of Old Cliped Money to carry on their Works, pay Servants Wa∣ges, and the Duty. And that putting out their Fires is Contrivance, as the Commissioners Insinuate, will appear only Contrivance in them and other Officers to continue their Salaries; when considered that the Masters have continued their Works so long, that want of Demand for Goods, forced them to put out their Fires; having such a Stock by them, as with a small Ad∣dition, will serve all demands to Lady-day next, as by account.
