HIs most Excellent Maiestie, taking knowledge of a Declaration of Remon∣strance, drawne and penned by some Committees of the Commons House of the late dissolued Parliament, and intended to haue beene preferred by them to His Maiestie, wherein are contained many things, which tend much to the dishonour of His now Maiestie, and of His late Maiestie, His Royall Father of euer blessed memorie, deceased; and whereby, through the sides of a Peere of this Realme, they wound the honour of their Soueraignes, Whereof His Maiestie being sensible, hath refused to admit the presenting thereof vnto Him: And whereas He vnderstandeth, that some of the mem∣bers of that House, ill affected to His seruice, to vent their owne passions against that Peere, at whom they specially aymed, & to prepossesse the world with an ill opinion of him, before his Cause were heard in a Judicial way, whereunto it was referred, haue beforehand willingly & purposely published and scattered Copies of that intended Declaration or Remonstrance, & therby haue en∣deauoured to detract much from the reputation of their Soueraigne, which in their allegiance to His Highnesse ought to haue beene deere and tender vnto them. His Maiestie therefore, for the re∣pressing of such an insufferable wrong vnto Himselfe, which might otherwise be of ill consequence, Doth straitly charge and command, vpon paine of His indignation and high Displeasure, all per∣sons, of what degree, quality, or condition soeuer, who haue, or at any time heereafter shall haue any Copie or Notes of the said Declaration or Remonstrance, intended to bee preferred vnto His Maiestie, as aforesaid, or shall come to the view thereof, forthwith, vpon publication of this Our Pleasure, to burne the same, that the memorie thereof may be vtterly abolished, and neuer giue occasion to His Maiestie, to renew the remembrance of that, which out of His Grace and Good∣nesse He would gladly forget: And if at any time heereafter any Copie or Notes of the said Decla∣ration or Remonstrance shall be found, or knowne to be in the hands or custodie of any of His sub∣iects, and not burnt, or caused to be burnt by them, as aforesaid; His Maiestie doth hereby declare, and publish His Royall Pleasure and Resolution to be, That He will proceed against all such of∣fenders and wilfull contemners of this His Royall Commandement, with that seueritie, which by the Law, or by His Prerogatiue Royall, He any wayes may iustly doe; and further, that His Maiestie will esteeme of all such, as persons ill affected both to His Person and gouernement. Giuen at His Maiesties Palace of Westminster the sixteenth day of Iune, in the second yeere of His Maiesties Reigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland. God saue the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by BONHAM NORTON and IOHN BILL, Printers to the Kings most Excellent MAIESTIE. M.DC.XXVI.
