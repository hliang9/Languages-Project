TO THE Courteous Peruser Of Our New Recreations. THere being not more men then minds, humours, and delights; every one having his judgment agreeable to his fancy; it is not to be wondred, that some should be legentes, & negligentes, Readers and slighters of these Recrea∣ions; some commending one thing, ome another: Est operae precium tota tellure peritos Offendisse duos, quorum mens consona lauder, Atque affirmet idem. It is a work worthy the labour, to find ut two men within this vast and spaci∣us Globe of the Earth, which may hink and speak the same things. Not∣withstanding
the Author considerin with himself how the world havin surfeited (usque ad nauseam) even o the abundance of Angels food, to th slighting, not only of the hony and hony comb, but of Marrow, and Manna, th Cornucopia and plenty of divine Wr¦tings: and how the most, taking ple¦sure in vain Pamphlets, Poesies, Pla books, and the like, (O saecula tricis d¦dita plebeis, insanâ agitata phrenesi have not only dulled many sharp wit but diverted hard Students from the goodly purposes; therefore at some v¦cant minutes, he strained his Inventio to the accomplishing of that whi herein for a Novelty is offered a tendered unto thee. It is not for hims that thus far he waded into the dep of hidden Curiosities, but for thy sa (Courteous Reader,) that he might these New and pleasant Recreatio take up some of thy vacant hours, al¦nate thy thoughts from vanities meer
sinful, or sports that by accident prove snares and evil; and to afford Lords and Ladies, Gentlemen, Gentlewomen, and young Schollars, as new Experi∣ments, so matters of merriment and contentment. It hath been observed by the Poet, that Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci. The prick and praise is gained from all by mixing things pleasing with profi∣table. The Author having been care∣full of both, this Work may happily be courteously entertained by some, and find demerited commendation. How ever, if Industry meet with Ingenuity, he cannot (I hope) be much condemned. The variation of the sixty Numbers in the twenty one Pages, marked with the Letters of the Alphabet, have not been less then one and twenty times sixty, viz. 1260 times varyed, where∣in may appear some pains, and patience in pursuing the transposition without
wearisomness, wherein the Author hath endeavored, , (according to the Proverb) to make somewhat of nothing, much of little. Huc, huc pervigiles curae, assiduique labores contendunt.— Having bent his study and assiduity to level at this mark, if he strike the white, and declare the truth in all things; Huc quaeso, Nardine, oculos, huc dirige mentem. Afford the same I pray thee, the as∣pect of a sweet and favorable counte∣nance. So Farewell. Thine, whiles he is his own, NICHOLAS HUNT.
A general Explanation of the use of the several Chapters in the first Book. WHen you would find out any Conclusion grounded on the former Chapters, as to know what King was thought upon in your minde, have recourse unto the first Chapter. To tell any Nobleman, Knight-Baronet, or Knight his name, and title of honour, then the party must be re∣ferred to the second Chapter: so of all other Experiments. What is said of the use of one Chapter, must be un∣derstood of all throughout the whole first Book. An Example for the understanding of the first Chapter. Suppose that your friend do think in his mind upon the name of one of the Princes of England, & you are to divine
and tell him what Prince or Princess he thought upon. Then open the Book at the first Chapter, and bid your friend think upon any name throughout the whole first Chapter: for example; sup∣pose it to be Queen Anne, page the first; on the left side you shall find 146. which sheweth that she was the wife of the 146 Prince or King, in the order of succession, namely of K. James: thus Aurelius is found to be the 9 Prince, Brute the first, Will. the Conqueror the 123. &c. Admit now that William the Conq. e thought upon, which is found in page 3. under the governing letter G, and the number 37 right against the Conqueror. That which you are to keep in mind, is only the page from whence the name of the party thought upon is taken, which here is 3. bid the party thinking to keep well in his mind the number right against the name, namely 37. then refer him to the page
marked with the letter G, at the top thereof (towards the end of this first Book) bid him to seek this number under one of the 4 Quarters, noted by the letters, K.L.I.H. Having found it, demand in which quarter it is: If he say in the third quarter, noted by the letter I, then refer him to the page I (at the top thereof) and bid him the second time seek the number so kept in mind: which being found again, de∣mand in which of the said quarters it is; if he say in the second quarter, marked with the letter D, there at D count the Alphabet over the numbers, and say, 54. A. 52. B. 53. C. 37. D. The letter D falling on 37. you may safely conclude, that 37 was the number kept in mind; seek this 37 in the third page, whence it was taken, and on the left hand you shall find William the Conqueror, who was the man thought upon.
How by the second Chapter you may tell a Noble man his Name, and Title of Honour, though you never knew him, nor saw him before. 1. Note, that the name of any of the greater or lesser Nobility is to be sought by the Sir-name, and not by the Christian-name. 2. If the name be found in the se∣cond Chapter (by the Alphabet) you may certainly tell him both his name, and title of honour, thus: 3. The party having found out his name, bid him to keep in mind the number which stands by the side of it; you your self must keep in mind the page, and also the letter which governs the said page: as for example; M go∣verns from 1 to 15. R governs from 16 to 30. G governs from 31 to 45. and B from 46 to 60.
Admit that Robert Lord Dormore, Earl of Carnarvan, demand his name of you, and you know him not, bid his Lordship by his Sirname to find out both Christian and Sirname, (the names being alphabetically disposed;) Robert L. Dormore, Earl of Carnarvan, being found, on the left hand the 24 page, bid his Honour to keep in mind the number which stands by the side of his Honours name, which being 20, (un∣known to you,) keep you in mind the four and twentieth page, whence the name was taken, and likewise the go∣verning letter of the said page, which is R. Then refer his Lordship to the Page of Numbers Transposed, or Va∣ried, marked at the top with the letter R, and bid him there to seek the num∣ber, (20) kept in mind, which being found, demand in which quarter it is: if it be said, in the third quarter, go∣verned by the letter T. Then bid his
Honour to seek the said number in the page governed by the letter T, at the top of the said page; which being found, demand the second time in which of the four quarters it be found: if it be answered, in the first quarter, go∣verned by the letter C, say the Alphabet over the said numbers; for C being the third letter in the Alphabet, will end on the third number of the first line, viz. on 20. giving you to understand, that 20 was the number first kept in mind: Seek this number secretly in the 24. page. from whence it was taken, and you shall find Robert L. Dormore, E. of Carnarvan, &c. How by the seventh Chapter, to tell any man his Christian-name, though you never saw him before. Let him enter into the seventh Chap∣ter, and seek his Christian-name by the Alphabetical letter thereof; suppose
it to be Meredith, which is found in the 97 Page, under the governing let∣ter G, which you that are to divine must keep well in minde; then bid him to think upon the number which is placed right against his name, which here is 35; turn you the Book unto the Numbers Transposed, or Varied, in the page G; under the page G bid your friend to seek for the number (35) kept in mind, which being found, demand in which of the four quar∣ters it is, and he will say in the third, governed by the letter I; therefore refer him the second time to seek the same number (35) kept in mind, under the page I: it being found, de∣mand the second time in which of the quarters it is; if it be said in the first, governed by the letter F, there count your Alphabet over the numbers, and say, A. 40. B. 39. C. 41. D. 42. E. 44. F. 35. F falling on 35, you may safe∣ly conclude, that 35 was the number
kept in mind: seek this 35 in the 97 page, whence it was taken, and right against the same you shall find the name of your friend, viz. Meredith. So do in all other Experiments, ac∣cording to all the varieties spe∣cified throughout the Chapters of the whole first Book.

The Second BOOK Of Arithmetical RECREATIONS. CAP. 1. Proposition. A Number thought and dou∣bled, after certain numbers added, to tell one, without asking any question, the Re∣mains of the work. Bid one to think a thought, and double the same, and then add any one, or many numbers, which may at last make an even number, which done, bid him cast away one half of
the total, and from the half remaining, to cast away the first thought, one half of the number or numbers added in un∣to the work will always remain. Example 1. Let the thought be 17 Double the same, it is 34 To this add 20 You have in all 54 From which cast away half, and the remains is 27 Cast away the first thought, 17 The remains will be 10, which is the half of twenty, added in to the work.
Example 2. Let your thought be 150 Double your thought, you have 300 Then add in * 40 And unto it * 17 And moreover * 9 * Which are by your self to be kept in mind, and the last number added must always make the former even, that you may take one half thereof, which will be equal to the remains of your work, &c. (which making 66 half of 66, viz. 33 will remain) The total of the thought doubled, and the 40. and 17. and 9. added in, is 366 Cast away one half of the total, the remains is 183 Cast away the first thought 150 The remains is 33 Which is half of the 66 added in un∣to the work.
Example 3. A. Thought   15 Doubled   30 Numbers added in 5 24 8 11 The total is   54 Cast away half, there resteth   27 Cast away your first thought,   15 The remains is   12 B. Thought   29 Doubled   58 Numbers added in 10 40 12 18 The total is   98 Cast away half, there resteth   49 Cast away your first thought   29 The remains is   20
C. Thought   175 Doubled   350 Numbers added in 17 84 18 49 The total is   434 Cast away half, and there resteth   217 Cast away your first thought   175 The remains is   42 Under A remaineth 12, which is the half of 24, the total of 5. 8. 11. added into the work. Under B resteth 20. which is half of 10. 12. and 18. or 40. added into the second work. Under C remaineth 42. which is half of 17. 18. 49. or 84. added in unto the third work. Thus you see that what number so∣ever may be thought, one half of the number or numbers added into the work, will always remain at last.
CAP. 2. To find out a number thought, or kept in mind. Proposition 1. A Thought doubled, and multiplied by 5, if from the product you cut off the figure, or rather the cipher in the first place, the remains on your left hand will be your thought. Example 1. Thought 49 49 doubled is 98 98 multiplied by 5, is 490 Cut off the cipher in the first place, 49(0 49, The remains shall be your thought.
Example 2. Thought 179 Doubled is 358 Multiplied by 5. The product is 1790 Demand the total, which being gi∣ven, it is 1790. cut off in your mind the Cipher, 179 (0, the remains shall be your thought. A second way to find out a number thought. Proposition 2. A thought doubled, and 5 added thereto, and the total multiplied by 5, if you cut off the figure in the first place, and take 2 from the remains, you shall at last come to your thought.
Example. The thought is 97 Doubled 194 5 added makes 199 Multiplied by 5, the total is 995 Demand the total, which here is 995, which being given unto you, cut off in your mind the 5 in the first place, it stands thus, 99. take 2 from 99, there resteth 97, your first thought. A third way to find out a number thought. Proposition 3. A thought doubled, and four added thereto, the total hereof multiplied by 5, and 12 added thereunto; If from the total (given unto you) you shall sub∣tract in your mind 32, and cut off the Cipher in the first place, the remains on your left hand will be your thought.
Example. Thought 377 Doubled 754 4 added makes 758 This multiplied by 5, is 3790 12 added, makes the total 3802 Subtract always 32 Resteth 377(0 Which demanded, and the Cipher cut off, give 377 for your thought. A fourth way to find out a number thought, the thought being even. Proposition. A thought trebled, (it being even) cast away one half, and treble the other half: Look how many times 9 you have in the product, so many times 2 shall be the number of your thought.
Example. Thought 18 Trebled is 54 Cast away half, then it is 27 This half trebled is 81 Demand the product, or total, which being 81; part the same by 9, your quotient will be 9, which multiplied by 2, giveth the number of your first thought, viz. 18. A fift way to find out an odd number thought. Proposition. An odd number being thought, and trebled, the product being also odd, keep one in mind: If you cast away the greater half, and treble the lesser, and divide the product (given you) by 9, the quotient doubled, and an unite ad∣ded (for the 1 kept in mind) the total will be your first thought.
Example. Thought is 157 Multiplied by 3. The product is odd, 471 Cast away one half, there is 235 ½ Multiplied by 3, it is 705 Demand the product, which being 705, and given unto you, divide the same by 9, the Quotient is 78, which multiplied by 2, and an unite added, the product is 157, your thought. A sixth way to find out a number thought. Proposition. Treble the number thought, then de∣mand whether it be even or odd: If it be answered odd, add an unite, and keep 1 in mind; then cast away half: treble this half, and demand whether it be even or odd: if it be odd the se∣cond
time, add an Unit, and keep two in mind: If it be odd both the first and second time, keep three in mind: Cast away one half, then demand the total remaining, every nine in the remains giveth 4 for your thought. Example. Thought 29 Trebled is 87 Keep 1 in mind, and add 1. 88 Cast away half, then it is 44 This half trebled is 132 Half whereof is 66 Demand the total, which being gi∣ven, divide the same by 9, you have for your Quotient 7. which multiplied by 4, and an Unit added, because it was odd the first time, maketh 29 for your thought.
Example 2. Let your thought be 34 Trebled, you have 102 Demand whether it be even or odd; if even, cast away half, it is 51 Treble this half, as three times 51 is 153 Demand the second time if it be even or odd: If it be answered, odd, add an Unit to make it even, and keep two in mind, it is 154: from which cst away half, the remains is 77. Demand the total remaining, which being 77, and given unto you, divide the same in your mind, or otherwise by help of your pen, the Quotient will be 8. Multiply the sme by 4, (because every 9 giveth 4) and add thereto 2, be∣cause it was odd the second time, the product will be 34, your thought.
A seventh way to find out a number thought. Proposition. A thought doubled, and 4 added thereto, and the whole multiplied by 5, and 12 added to this total; if from the same you subtract 32, (every article of the remains, or) one tenth, giveth an unite of the number thought. Example. Suppose the thought 85 Double the same it is 170 Add 4 thereto it is 174 Which multiplied by 5, is 870 Add 12 to this product, and it is, 882 Demand what the total is: if it be said, 882, subtract in your mind 32, the remains is 850. then from the re∣mains take one tenth, or cut off a figure, you have 85 for your thought.
An eighth way to find out a number thought. A thought trebled, and an unite ad∣ded thereto, if it be odd the first time, (for odd the first time keep one in mind) and the half thereof trebled again: If you divine the product by 9, the Quo∣tient doubled, and an unite added there∣to, bringeth forth your first thought. Example. Let the number thought be 55 Which trebled is 165 Demand whether it be even or odd, which here is odd, therefore keep one in mind, and bid the party that thinketh to add 1 to the same, which maketh 166: and from the same to cast away half, the rest is 83 Secondly, bid him treble this half, it is 249.
Demand the total, which given is 249. Divide the same in your mind, or otherwise, by 9. the Quotient is 27. Which doubled, and an Unit added thereto, (because it was odd the first time) the total will be 55, your thought. Example 2. An even thought, 468 Trebled, it is 1404 Cast away half, it is 702 This half trebled is 2106 The Explanation. The thought is 468, which trebled is 1404, half whereof is 702. This half 702 being trebled (as before) is 2106. Demand the total: answer will be made, 2106. Part the same by 9, the Quotient will be 234. which doubled giveth your first thought.
A nineth way to finde out a number thought. 1. An odd number. Proposition. Let a thought be trebled, and if it be odd, an Unit added thereto; and for the Unit added, keep one in your mind; then cast away one half from the whole, &c. And secondly, treble this half, and if it be odd, add an Unit thereto, keeping two in minde; and cast away one half from the whole: Demanding the To∣tal or product, which given you, if you part or divide the same by 9, the quoti∣ent multiplyed by 4, and for odd the first time one added to the product, and for odd the second time two added to the product; and for odd both first and second time, three being added to the product, the Total at last will be your Thought.
Example. Let your thought be an odd number, 235; this trebled is 705: demand if it be even or odd, the answer is odd, put one to it, and keep one in minde, the total is 706: cast away half, the re∣mains is 353. Secondly, bid the party thinking to treble this half, it is 1059. Demand if it be even or odd, the answer wil be, odd; therefore put one thereto, and keep two in minde, it is 1060, an even number; bid him then to cast away half, the remains is 530. Demand what the whole comes un∣to, or how many nines can be given in the same, which being 58, (for 1/9 of 530, is 58, and 8 remaining, which is of no value) multiply in your minde this 58 by 4, and for odd, both first and second time, add in 3, the product will be 235, your first thought.
Example 2. of an even number. Thought 76 Trebled 228. Even. 1. One half is 114 That half trebled is 342. Even. 2. One half of that is 171 1/9 of 171 is 19 19 multiplyed by 4, giveth 76, your first thought. A tenth way to finde out a number thought, without asking any que∣stion. Bid one to think a number, and there∣to to put one half thereof, which he cannot do (as being odd) let him add the greater half to his thought, and for the same keep 3 in minde, to be sub∣tracted from the whole, or the product, at last. Secondly, To the former thought, and the half thereof added thereto, let
the party thinking add one half of the Total again, which if he cannot do, it being odd the second time, keep two in your minde to be at last subtracted, and add the greater half to this To∣tal. Thirdly, Bid the party to double his first Thought, and take it out of the whole sum, and cast away half, one half from the remains, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times, or more, until you bring him to an Unit, of which he cannot take half. But when he cannot take half, as of 9; bid him cast away one, and then reject half, it is 4, half of 4 is 2, and half of 2 is 1, an Unit. To finde the Dividend, or number divided, ascend in your minde after the order of Geometrical Progression, as here: Divisions. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. Progression numbers. 1024. 512. 256. 128. 64. 32. 16. 8. 4. 2.
If you take half four times, until you come to an Unit, the number of Pro∣gression thus parted by 2 was 16. For half of 16 is 8, half of 8 is 4, half of 4 is 2, half of 2 is 1. Note. Multiply this your Dividend by 4, the product shall be your Thought. Exception. But if your Thought was odd, that you could not take half of it at the first, subtract 3 from this Product, and the rest will be your Thought. Finding an odd half the second time, keep 2 in minde to be subtracted, as be∣fore. If the first and the second time you meet with odd halfs, keep five in minde, to be subtracted from the product of your Dividend multiplyed by 4, (as a∣fore is declared) the remains will be your Thought.
Example 1. Of an odd number thought, wherein falleth out no odd half. Let the number thought be 64 Half as much added is 32 The total is 96 Half as much added, is 48 The Total is 144 Double the Thought 64, it is 128 Subtract the same from 144 The remains for Dividend is 16 Cast away half, it is 8 Cast away half, it is 4 Cast away half, it is 2 Cast away half, it is 1 Here are four Divisions by 2. or you cast away half four times: there∣fore reckon the Divisions contrariwise, upwards, and count the first 2, the se∣cond 4, the third 8, the fourth 16, &c. so are you fallen upon your number di∣vided, called the Dividend, that is to
say, 16. Multiply in your minde this 16 by 4, the product will be your num∣ber thought, viz. 64. Example 2. Of an odd number thought, wherein is an odd half the first time. Let the number thought be 37 Add half as much the first time, which because you cannot, keep three in mind, and add the greater half unto it, which is 19 The Total will be 56 Add the second time 28, which add∣ed to 56, is in all 84 Double your Thought, and subtract: the Thought doubled is 74 74 subtracted from 84, resteth 10 (This 10 is your Dividend.) Bid the party that thought cast away half, the remains is 5. Bid him cast a∣way half again; the answer will be
he cannot: Then bid him cast away an Unit, and keep one in minde: (this U∣nit in your minde must be added in a∣gain in the right and proper place to finde out the Dividend) and after that cast away half: as half of 4 (one being rejected) is 2. Bid him cast away half again the third time, and the remains will be 1, an Unit. Now if you bid him cast away half again, he will answer, that he cannot do it, because he is come to an Unit, which being rejected, the remains will be a cipher: now you are to cast away half but until you come to an Unit. But when in casting away half you meet with an odd number before you come to an Unit, keep well in your minde in which of the Divisions it hap∣pened to be odd, whether the first, se∣cond, third, fourth, or fifth. Here it was in the first. For half of 10 was 5; which falling out to be odd, you did necessarily cast away one, and the re∣mains
was 4 to divide by 2, or to cast a∣way half therefrom. Example. 10. half 10 is 5, odd; reject 1, half 5 is 2; half 2 is 1. The Divisions are you see 3: there∣fore ascend upwards by Geometrical Progression, thus: 2. 5. 10. (and not as before, 2. 4. 8.) otherwise you can∣not come to the true Dividend, which was 10. Wherefore from 2 proceed in your minde to 4, where falling out for∣merly odd, add the Unit cast away, you have 5; which doubled, giveth precise∣ly your Dividend, 10. Multiply this Dividend in your mind by 4, the product is 40, from which subtract 3 kept in minde at the first (be∣cause you met with an odd half) the remains will be 37, your Thought.
Example 3. Of an odd number thought, wherein are odd halfs both times. Let your thought be 107 Add ½ as much unto it, if you can∣not, add the greater half 54, and keep in minde 3: the Total of both is 161 Add half as much unto it, if not, add the greater half 81, and keep in minde 2: The Total of both is 244 Your Thought doubled is 214, which subtracted, resteth 28, the Dividend. 1 Cast away half, there resteth 14 2 Cast away half, there resteth 7 3 Cast away half. Answer, I cannot, because it is odd. I reply, you must cast away an Unit, and then cast away half, it is 3 4 Cast away half: Answer, I can∣not. Reply, Cast away 1, and then cast away half, rest 1 The divisions are four. Now because at the two last Divisions you rejected
an Unit before you could cast away half, therefore you must add them in a∣gain thus, saying in your minde, not 2. 4. 8. 16. &c. but 3, where your Unit is again added in, then 7, where your other Unit is again added in; then 14, and last of all 28; so are you fallen up∣on the right Dividend. Multiply the same by 4, saying, 4 times 28 is 112. Subtract 3 for the first odd half, and 2 for the second odd half, which 5 you kept in minde for the two odd halfs, and say, 5 from 112, there resteth 107, your thought. Example 4. Compare it with Example 1. Of an even thought, wherein both halfs fall out likewise even. Suppose the Thought to be 256 Half added, is 128 The Total is 384 Half of 384 is 192
The Total 576 Thought doubled 512 Subtracted, resteth 64. your Dividend. The partitions are 6, all even. 1 Cast away half, it is 32 2 Cast away half, it is 16 3 Cast away half, it is 8 4 Cast away half, it is 4 5 Cast away half, it is 2 6 Cast away half, it is 1 Proceed therefore thus, saying in your minde, 2. 4. 8. 16. 32. 64. Order of ascent to finde out your Di∣vidend. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Number of Divisions. The Dividend being found to be 64, multiply the same by 4, it is 256, your Thought. Example 5. Of an odd number thought, wherein both the halfs fall out odd. A number thought, is 15. The grea∣ter half added is 8, and keep 3 in minde.
The Total is 23 The greater half is 12 Add and keep 2 in minde. The Total is 35 The Thought doubled is 30 Subtract, rested 5 for Dividend. Cast away half: I cannot; but I cast away an Vnit, the remains is 4. Cast a∣way half of 4, the remains is 2. Cast a∣way half, the remains is 1. The Partitions or Divisions being two, ascend in your minde thus; 2. 4. Hereunto add the Vnit rejected at the first, you have 5 for your Dividend. 5 Your Dividend multiplyed by 4, giveth 20; from which subtract 3 and 2, which is 5 (because you met with two odd halfs, and added in two grea∣ter halfs, and for the first kept three in minde, and for the second 2, which maketh 5) which taken from 20, the remains will be 15, your Thought.
CAP. 3. Any number being thought, after two multiplications, and two divisions, to tell what number will fall out in the Quotient. Proposition 1. A Number thought, and multiplyed by 6; this product divided by 3, the quotient multiplyed by 10, or a ci∣pher added thereunto: If you divide the same by 5, and the quotient hereof di∣vide again by the first Thought, there will always remain the number 4 in your quotient. Example 1. The Thought 18. Multiplyed by 6, the product is 108. One third part 36. 10
Example 2. Thought 397 Multiplyed by 6, is 2382 ⅓ 794. 0   ⅕ is 1588.   Proposition 2. A number multiplyed by 4, and the product hereof divided by 2. This quo∣tient multiplyed by 6, and divided by 4: this quotient parted by the first Thought, giveth in the last quotient the number 3. Or a number doubled, and six times increased, one fourth of the product parted by the first Thought, giveth 3 in your last quotient, as before.
Example 1. The Thought is 9 Four times 9, is 36 Half of 36, is 18 Six times 18, is 108 One fourth of 108, is 27 Which divide by 9, your Thought, giveth in the quotient 3. Example 2. Thought 375 Multiplyed by 4, is 1500 Cast away half 750 750 Multiplyed by 6. The product is 4500 One fourth part whereof is 1125 your Dividend, which parted by 375 your Thought, giveth 3 in the quoti∣ent.
Proposition 3. A Cypher added to a number thought; the Total cut off half, and a Cypher again added thereto, one fifth deducted, and one tenth subtracted from the remains, produceth precisely your first Thought. Example. Thought 17 A Cypher added 170 Half deducted 85 A Cypher added 850 One fifth subtracted 170 One tenth of 170 is your Thought. One tenth of 17 | 0 is 17.
CAP. 4. Gold and Silver being exchanged, or shifted from hand to hand, to divine in which hand is the Gold, and which the Silver. THe number for Gold, let it be an even number, admit 4. The number for the Silver, suppose it to be 3, an odd number. Proposition. The number of the piece in the right hand multiplyed by 3; and the number of the piece in the left hand multiplyed by 4, let both be added together. The Total of both being 1 Even. Resolution. 1. The thing of best value is in the righ hand. Gold in the right hand. Silver in the left. 2 Odd. 2. The thing of worst value is in the right hand. Silver in the right hand. Gold in the left hand.
CAP. 5. TWo names being written in two peeces of paper, and the one being put into the right hand, the other into the left, to tell what name is in the one hand, and what in the other. Admit the two names to be John and Thomas; the number for John to be 4, and the number for Thomas to be 5. Proposition. The number of the name in the right hand multiplyed by 3, and the number of the name in the left hand multiplyed by 4: If the Total added be 1 Even. Resolution. John in the right hand. Thomas in the left. 2 Odd. Thomas in the right hand. John in the left.
CAP. 6. Six Counters or Table-men placed in a Circle, and any one touched, to di∣vine which it was. Proposition. THe Counters placed in order thus, add 7 to the number of   1.   2.   6. 3.   5.   4.   the Counter touched, then be∣gin at the Counter touched, and call it an Vnit more then it stands for, and tell on from the right hand to the left, until you come to the total number; where it ends you shall finde the number first touched. Example. Admit D the   1A   B2   6F C3   5E   D4   fourth Counter to be touched, add 7 to the number of the said Counter, the Total is 11. Begin at D, and count it an Vnit more then it is, tell on by C. B. A. F. E.
until you end with the number 11. you shall finde it to fall on D, (the number 4) where you began at first. You may therefore conclude, that D was the Counter touched. Count D 5, C 6, B 7, A 8, F 9, E 10, then 11 will rest on D, where you began. Beginning at any of these 7 Letters or Counters, and reckoning A the 2, B the 3, C the 4, D the 5, E the 6, F the 7, count backwards to the number of 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13.   2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 8 A. F. E. D. C. B. A.   3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 9 B. A. F. E. D. C. B.   4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10 10 C. B. A. F. E. D. C.   5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11 11 D. C. B. A. F. E. D.   6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 12 E. D. C. B. A. F. E.   7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 13 F. E. D. C. B. A. F.
CAP. 7. Two persons thinking two numbers, the one an even number, and the other an odd number, to divine and tell who thought the one, and who the other. BId the first man to double his Thought, and the second man to treble his, then to add both numbers to∣gether. Then bid the one of them ast away half; which if he can do, the To∣tal is even, otherwise odd. 1 Even. The Total being Even, The first man thought odd. The second man thought even. 2 Odd. The Total being odd, The first man thought even. The second man thought odd.
Example. 1 Man. 2 Man. Thought 15. 24 Doubled, is 30. Trebled, is 72 30 and 72 added together, is 102 The Total is even, because half may be cast away. The Total being Even, the conclusi∣on is, the first man thought odd, and the second man thought even, &c. 1 Man. 2 Man. Thought 34. Thought 45 Doubled, is 68. Trebled, is 135 Add 68, and the Total of both is 2013. Cast away half. Answer, I cannot. The Total therefore is odd. The To∣tal being odd, the Conclusion is, the first man thought Even, the second man thought odd. Four men thinking on four Digit numbers, (which are from 1 to 9) to
tell what the first, second, third, and fourth man thought. This conclusion findeth out any num∣ber thought, under 10000. Four persons standing in rank, admit the first think 8, the second 7, the third 6, and the fourth 5. Let the first man double the number of his Thought, and add 5 thereto, then multiply the whole by 5, and add 10 to the product, noting the Total. Bid the second man demand of the first man his total number, which being given him, let him add unto the same his Thought, and give the Total to the third man. Then bid the third man to affix or set his Thought by the number given him, and put it one place towards the right hand, and give the Total thereof to the fourth man. Last of all, bid the fourth man set his Thought thereby, a place yet to the right hand, in the first place, and add
the number of 25 unto it; that done, demand of him the total number, which being given you, subtract out of it 3525 the number remaining will discover the four mens thoughts. The Digit on the left hand sheweth the first mans thought; the next Digit towards the right hand is for the se∣cond mans thought; the figure in the second place representeth the third mans thought, and the figure in the first place giveth the fourth mans thought. Example. 1. The first mans thought 8, which being doubled is 16, and 5 added there∣to is 21, which multiplied by 5 is 105. Whereunto add 10, the whole is 115 2. Secondly, let the second man add in 7 (his thought) it stands thus, 122 3. Let the third man set his thought a place to the right hand thus, 122, 6
4. Let the fourth man place his thought a place yet to the right hand thus: 1226. 5 Also bid him add in 25, and it ma∣keth 12290 Demand the total, it is 12290 Which being given you, deduct 3525 The remains will be 8765 Ans. The first man thought 8, the second man thought 7, the third man thought 6, the fourth man 5. Example. First mans thought 8 Doubled is 16. and 5 added 21. Mul∣tiplied by 5, is 105, and 10 added in is 115 Second mans thought added in is 7 The total is 122 Third and fourth mans thought set thereby, 122. 6. 5 25 Added, makes 12290 Subtract 3525 Particular thoughts, 8. 7. 6. 5 Of the 4 Men, 1. 2. 3. 4

Admit him whom in your order you shall make the fifth person wear the Ring upon his right hand, or first hand, and upon his fore-finger with the Mer∣chant, and the third joynt, (which count from the nayl to the hand, 1. 2. 3.) &c. First, Bid one that standeth by to double the number of the person, then to add 5 thereto, and multiply the whole by 5, and to the product to add 10 more, as also the number of the hand, 1 for the right hand, and 2 for the left.
Secondly, Bid him to set by this pro∣duct, the number of the finger, viz. in the first place. Thirdly, Bid him to set the number of the joynt, one place yet to the right hand, and add thereto the number 25. Demand the whole number, which being given, deduct out of the same 3525, the remains will shew the num∣ber of the person, hand, finger, joynt. Example 1.

CAP. 11. To place the 9 Digits in such wise, as every three of them may make 15 eight several ways. MAke 9 pricks by 3 in rank, and 3 in file. . 3 4 . . . . 5 . . . . . . . . . . Take ⅓ of 15, and place it in the middest, 4 in the right corner above, and 3 in the middest a∣bove. These three numbers thus placed will make all the rest. Example. 4 and 3 is 7, and 8 maketh 15: place 8 against 4 and 3, in the left angle or corner. 4 and 5 is 9, and 6 ma∣keth 8 3 4 1 5 9 6 7 2 15: place 6 against 4 and 5, in the left cor∣ner beneath.
8 and 5 is 13, and 2 is 15: place 2 against 8 and 5 in the right corner be∣neath. 8 and 6 is 14, and 1 maketh 15: place one between 8 and 6. 3 and 5 is 8, and 7 maketh 15: place 7 under 3 and 5. 4 and 2 is 6, and 9 maketh 15: place 9 on the right side, in the middest be∣tween 4 and 2. Thus have you made 15 eight ways of nine Numbers. Fifteen 8 ways of the 9 Digits. The 8 Variations. 8 3 4. 1 5 9. 6 7 2. Rank or brest. 8 1 6. 3 5 7. 4 9 2.

CAP. 12. Three numbers being given, 20. 24. and 28. to make a square of them, 9 in a Rank. A General having gotten a Noble man Prisoner, commanded a Guard of 9 Souldiers in a Squadron to wait upon his person, as here: The first Square of 24 Men. 3 3 3   3 O 3 The 1 figure 3 3 3   How four being deducted, with 20 men to make the like figure of 9 in rank, and 9 in file. Four of this Guard desire leave of their General to be absent for a few days; whereupon the General reply∣ed, That unless they could make 9 men
still in a rank to safe-guard the Prisoner, they could have no leave granted unto them. If that be all, we shall (said these 24 Souldiers) leave a sufficient Guard of 9 in a rank. They placed the residue (20 in number) thus, as in this second figure. The second Square of 20 Men. 4 1 4 1 O 1 4 1 4 How 8 men being added in unto the for∣mer figure, with 28 men to make only a Square of 9 men in Rank, and 9 men in File, as before. Over a few days these 4 Souldiers returned; and as they travelled, met with other 4. which lacking service, desired them to be a means unto their General that they might be admitted into fellowship and service with them.
They replyed, That their General had a Squadron of 9 men already, and they being 4 more might only be admitted; but 4 more (as these strangers made) could not come within the Squadron. The 4 strange Souldiers ranked them∣selves with the 24 thus, and so were admitted. The third Square of 28 Men. 2 5 2 5 0 5 2 5 2 CAP. 13. Thirty men being placed in a Circle, 15 of one kind, and 15 of another, to save the one half, and reject the other, casting away every ninth Number. SUppose 30 Malefactors are to be executed for Piracy, 15 Christians, and 15 Turks, and the Sheriff hath pow∣er to save one half, but must execute every ninth man.
Quest. How shall he place them in such order and rank, as that he may ex∣ecute the Turks, and preserve alive the Christians? Answ. By the order of the five Vowels in this Latin Verse: Populeam virgā mater regina tenebat. Vowels a. e. i. o. u. Order of the Vowels 1 2 3 4 5 Those whom he would save he must begin with, and rank them thus. To cast away every ninth Number. Po 4 Christians. pu 5 Turks. le 2 Christians. am 1 Turk.

0 Character of the Christians. 1 Character of the Turks. Their order, or manner of Ranking. Begin at A, and tell on to B, casting away every ninth, until you have gone over them all, and cancld the Turks, thus, . How by the Verse following you may cast away every tenth number. There being 15 of one sort, and 15 of another. Suppose them Apples and Nut-shels, to place them in length, or circular∣wise, and take up the tenth as they are placed, and reserve the Apples for your self, &c. To reject and cast out the Nut-shels
by every tenth number, beginning with the Apples, make use of the Verse fol∣lowing. Rex 2 00 Apples. Pa 1 1 Shells. phi 3 000 Apples. cum 5 11111 Shells. Gen 2 00 Apples. te 2 11 Shells. Bo 4 0000 Apples. na 1 1 Shells. dat 1 0 Apples. Sig 3 111 Shells. na 1 0 Apples. Se 2 11 Shells. re 2 00 Apples. na. 1 1 Shells. Every tenth rejected, 15 remain, that is to say, the 15 Apples, represented by the 1-5 Ciphers; as followeth:

EMpty A into B, B into C, C into A, B into C, A into B, B into C: So in B (the measure of 5 Pints) there will remain 4 Pints. Then empty C into A, and C will have nothing, but A will likewise have 4 Pints. CAP. 15. To find out the hour any one should think in his mind either to rise, or to go to rest.
letters A-M displayed in a counter-clockwise diamond shape, with A in the twelve o'clock position A B C D E F G H I K L M THis Circle divided into 12 equal parts, by the Letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, signifieth, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, the hours of the Artificial Day, from Sun-rising to Sun-setting; also the twelve hours of the Day, and the 12 hours of the Night, the Natural Day. A, signifieth 1 a clock, B, 2 a clock, C, 3 of the clock, G, 7 of the clock, H, 8 of the clock, and M, 12 of the clock.
N. O. desires to know the hour he shall think in his minde to go to his rest. Bid him to think upon the hour, which suppose to be a 11, then to point upon one of these 12 Letters, where he will begin to make his account: Sup∣pose he shall say at G; which from A, is the seventh hour. Add 13 to the number which G doth represent, viz. 7, the total will be 20. Say then unto N. O. that he must begin at G, and tell from G towards A, reckoning round about until he rest upon the number of 20, calling G the number next to that he thinks in his minde to take his rest; viz. 12, F 13, E 14, D 15, C 16, B 17, A 18, M 19, L 20. 20 ending at L, and L representing the 11 hour, you may safely conclude that N. O. thought to take his rest at 11 of the clock at night.
Letters representing the 12 hours of Day and Night. Letters. A Hours represented. 1 Numbers to reckon unto. 14 B 2 15 C 3 16 D 4 17 E 5 18 F 6 19 G 7 20 H 8 21 I 9 22 K 10 23 L 11 24 M 12 25 Beginning to count from A to M, and from 1 to 12, Tell on from the right hand towards the left, from K to G, from G to A, M, L, K, &c. Resting at these Numbers (from 14 to 25) you shall by the Letter which you rest on, finde the hour of Day or Night, which it representeth in this Table, un∣der the title of Hours represented. Example. Ending on A, the first hour was thought upon: ending on B, the second hour: ending on C, and reckoning 16, from your thought, you shall fall on a Letter between A and M, which sup∣pose I, it represents 9 in the Table,
K 10 of the clock, L 11 of the clock, and M 12 of the clock, &c. CAP. 16. Magnetical Experiments. How by the Magnet, or Loadstone, to give vertue to a Knife to take up a Needle. WHet or glase the Knife to make it clean and bright, to receive the vertue of the stone, which being capped, draw your Knife softly on the North Cap (which is the strongest) from the Haft to the Point, on both sides thereof, as also on the back and edg, it hath drawn vertue and efficacy from the Magnet; so that if you lay a Needle to the point of your Knife, or cast it into a glass or cup of any liquor, it will demonstrate the attractive power thereof, by holding it at the point, like a new Lover that is loath to depart.
To take away the attractive vertue from any Knife touched with the Magnet. Cut Onyons or Garlick therewith: Or thrust the Knife upon the point of the stone that is contrary to that which it was touched withall: as if the North cap gave vertue, the South cap or end will take it away: or if the South first gave vertue, the North point will take it off again, by sliding your Knife soft∣ly upon the contrary cap, from the point of the Knife towards the haft, &c. To make a Needle of a Sun-Dyal to fly up and down circularly. Hold the Sun-Dyal or Compass level with the Horizon, apply the North or South point to the Sun-Dyal, holding it over the same: as you move your hand round, so will the Needle fol∣low
the Loadstone in your hand. Apply the South end of your stone to the Needle of the Sun-Dyal, touched with the North point, and it will fly a∣way: so the North end of the stone will make the South end of the Needle to shift it self from the touch or em∣bracement thereof. How by help of the Magnet to cause two Knives to turn round upon the point of a Needle, or sharp Bodkin. Prepare two Knives somewhat neer of an equal weight, that the one may counterpoyze the other: cut a small stick, about an inch and half in length, and make the one end blunt, and the o∣ther sharp, or small at the point, and four-square; fasten one of your Knives points in the blunt end of your stick, and fasten the other in like manner in the opposite or contrary side, and put the harfts of your Knives so far in, as by
putting the sharp end of the stick on a Needles point, or Bodkin, your Knives being poyzed, cannot fall. Put them inward or outward, until by practise you shall perceive them to incline almost to a level with the Hori∣zon: for then are they aptest by vertue of the Magnets vertue to be drawn a∣bout upon their center, the Needle. If you keep the Magnet within your Handkerchiff in your hand, so that it do not appear, the experiment will seem the more illustrious and rare. When the Knives are thus fixed to the sides of the stick, you may put the point of the sharp end of the stick on the brim of a Glass full of Beer, or wine, and the Knives will not fall, or fail to shew you a Conclusion somewhat strange. To make two Needles run at Tilt in a Bason of Water. Cut two small Corks four-square, a∣bout
the thickness of a quill, thrust the first Needle through the one, and the se∣cond Needle through the other Cork; and let both Corks be alike: Touch the point of one Needle with the North end of the Loadstone, and the other Needles point with the South end of the stone: Cast them (thus touched by the Mag∣net) into the Bason of water, they will, though slowly at the first, march on somewhat furiously at the last, and most exactly strike point against point. CAP. 17. To cause three Knives, being placed triangular-wise, to bear up a Glass full of water or wine, so that never a point of the 3 Knives shall touch the table, nor the glass fall, or totter. 1. TAke up one Knife in your left hand, with the edg towards your right.
2. Take up another in your right hand with the edg toward the left, holding with your left hand them both immove∣able. 3. Take up the third Knife in your right hand, with the point towards you, and the edg directed to the left hand. 4. Let the first Knife rest upon this third, and this third be above the se∣cond, resting upon the same; the three Knives thus placed, will represent a Tri∣angle. Place the glass of liquor upon them, they will stand firmly, the hafts being not to be lifted up by the weight of your hand on the points of the Knives. CAP. 18. To cause water (contrary to the na∣ture thereof) to ascend. PRepare a Bason with a pynt of wa∣ter in it, or thereabouts, then take
an earthen Pot or Jug with a round bel∣ly (fittest for this service) and light a peece of paper, cast it into the Jug fla∣ming, then turn quickly the mouth of the Jug downward, and set it on the midst of the Bason of water; it will suck up all the water, if it be not more then it can receive and contain within the belly thereof. CAP. 19. To carry a Jug or earthen Pot, stick∣ing without any thing unto the palm of your hand. TAke a peece of paper, set it on fire, and cast it flaming into the mouth of the Jug, presently clap the palm of your hand on the mouth of the said Jug or Pot, not hollow, but plain and smooth; the Jug will not fall from your hand, but you may walk many paces, and carry the same sticking unto
the palm of your hand, unless by vio∣lence you pluck it away. CAP. 20. To break a stick placed on the brims of two glasses, and not break the glasses. PLace the glasses on a smooth stone of an equal height, and put the stick upon them; then take a batton or cud∣gel, and therewith strike upon the midst of the stick perpendicularly, or down-right: so may you break the stick, and not hurt the glasses. CAP. 21. Secrets of Writing, &c. How Letters written in paper are one∣ly apparent by casting dust thereon. DIssolve Goats fat with a little gum of the Turpentine tree, rub the
paper with this liquor, and wash it o∣ver, and so keep it a while; then when you will declare your minde therein un∣to any one, put the paper (washed o∣ver with this fat) on the Table, take a sharp peece of Iron or steel, or a pen made thereof, and write your minde in letters and words on the back-side of the paper, the signs or letters of fat will be imprinted on the Table: send this, which being intercepted, will neither by fire nor water be visible, but by cast∣ing thereon the dust of the Earth, &c. To make white Letters to appear on a black peece of paper. Beat both the yolk and white of an Egg well together, until it be liquid like writing Ink, write your minde therewith on paper, suffering it to dry; then wash over your paper with some black colour, such as Printers Ink is, and put it by until both be dry. Then take
your Knife and scrape over the super∣ficis of the paper, the letters formerly written will come forth, and whites appear in their room. To write in parchment, and the letters not to be seen, &c. As soon as you have written in parch∣ment, hold it to a candle, or the heat of the fire, and it will shrivel together, and run into it self in such wise, as not a word scarce can be read: when you would have it legible, put it in a wet or moyst place, or sprinkle it gently with water, and it will extend in length again. To write Letters, or Characters, that will soon vanish. Take aquavitae, and Charcole, or the gum of Camphire burnt to a coal, and write therewith, the powder of a
Touchstone will rub it clean out. 2. Take thin filings of steel, and bring them to powder, grinding upon a Marble stone with aquafortis, where∣unto add a little liquid pitch, or the gum of the Turpentine Tree burnt to powder, to make it the more black, write herewith, and in time it will van∣ish and go out. How invisible Letters over a while will be visible. Write on Copper with the juice of an Orenge, over a while the Letters will appear green. To get out and deface the writings or blots upon parchment. Take a pensil and wash the place or the parchment with aquafortis, and the Ink will come out.
To make an old writing appear fair. Take galls and boyl them in wine, and wash the writing therewith. To take the impression of any Seal. Melt a little Brimstone, casting in some Ceruse or white Lead, put this mixture on the Seal, strengthening it with a small peece of paper, a little big∣ger then the impression is; being cold, take it off, and you shall finde the print of the Seal thereon. How to write a Letter secretly, that cannot easily be discovered or suspected. 1. Write your minde at large on one side of the paper with common Ink, and on the other side with milk, that which you would have secret; and
when you would make the same legi∣ble, hold that side which is written with Ink to the fire, and the milky let∣ters will shew blewish on the other side. 2. Rule two papers of one bigness with lines of an equal distance, make the one full of glass-windows, through which you must write your minde up∣on the second paper, then fill up the spaces with some other words at your pleasure: but if all were made to hang together in good sence, it would carry the less suspicion.

CAP. 22. Of Pythagorus Schollars. PYthagorus being asked what num∣ber of Schollars he had, answered, That half of them studied Mathema∣ticks, the fourth part Physick, the se∣venth part Rhetorick, and besides he had 3 women: Now judg you, saith he, how many Schollars I have. Answer. He had in all 28, the half of which is 14, the quarter of which is 7, and the seventh part of which is 41 which 14, 7 and 4 makes 25, and the other 3, to make up the 28, were the 3 women.
Of the Mule and the Ass. IT happened, that the Mule and the Ass upon a day making a voyage, each of them carried a barrel full of Wine: Now the lazy Ass felt her self over-loaden, complained and bowed under her burthen; which the Mule seeing, said unto her, being angry (for it was in the time when beasts spake) Thou great Ass, wherefore complainest thou? If I had but only one measure of that which thou carriest, I should be loaden twice as much as thou art; and if I should give a measure of my loading to thee, yet my burthen would be as much as thine. Now how many measures did each of them carry? Answer. The Mule did carry 7 measures, and the Ass 5 measures: for if the Mule had one of the measures of the Asses loading, then the Mule would have 8
measures, which is double to 4; and giving one to the Ass, each of them would have equal burthens, to wit, 6 measures a peece. Of the Dyal upon the fingers and the hand. IS it not a commodity very agreeable, when one is in the field, or in some Village, without any other Dyal, to see only by the hand what of the clock it is, which gives it very near, and may be practised by the left hand in this manner. Take a straw, or like thing, of the length of the Index, or the second fin∣ger, hold this straw very right between the thumb and the right finger, then stretch forth the hand, and turn your back and the palm of your hand to∣wards the Sun, so that the shadow of
the muscle which is under the thumb touch the line of life, which is between the middle of the two other greatlines, which is seen in the palm of the hand; this done, the end of the shadow will shew what of the clock it is: for at the end of the great finger it is 7 in the morning, or 5 in the evening; at the end of the ring finger it is 8 in the morning, or 4 in the evening; at the end of the little finger, or first joynt, it is 9 in the morning, or 3 in the after∣noon; 10 and 2 at the second joynt, 11 and 1 at the third joynt, and midday in the line following, which comes from the end of the Index. Of three Women that sold Apples. THree Women, A, B, C, carryed Apples to a Market to sell, A had 20, B 30, and C 40; they sold as many
for a peny the one as the other, and brought home one as much mony as an∣other, how could this be? The Answer to the Problem is easie; as suppose at the beginning of the mar∣ket A sold her Apples at 1 peny an Ap∣ple, and sold but 2, which was 2 pence, and so she had 18 left: but B sold 17, which was 17 pence, and so had 13 left; C sold 32, which was 32 pence, and so had 8 Apples left: Then A said she would not sell her Apples so cheap, but would sell them for 3 pence a peece, which she did, and so her Apples came to 54 pence; and B having left but 13 Apples, sold them at the same rate, which came to 39 pence: And lastly, C had but 8 Apples, which at the same rate came to 24 pence. These sums of mony which each others before recei∣ved come to 56 pence, and so much each one received, and so consequently brought home one as much as another.
Of three Men that bought Wine. THree men bought a quantity of Wine, each payd alike, and each was to have alike; it happened at the last partition that there was 21 barrels, of which 7 were full, 7 half full, and 7 empty: how must they share the wine and vessels, that each have as many ves∣sels one as another, and as much wine one as another? This may be answered two ways as followeth, and these numbers, 2, 2, 3, or 3, 3, 1, may serve for direction, and signifies that the first person ought to have 3 barrels full, and as many empty ones, and one which is half full, so he shall have 7 vessels, and 3 barrels and a half of liquor; and one of the other shall in like manner have as muc, so there will remain for the third man 1 barrel full, 5 which are half full, and 1 empty, and so every one shall have alike
both in vessels and wine. And gene∣rally to answer such Questions, divide the number of vessels by the number of persons, and if the Quotient be not an entire number, the Question is impossi∣ble; but when it is an entire number, there must be made as many parts as there are 3 persons, seeing that each part then the half of the said Quotient; as dividing 21 by 3, there comes 7 for the Quotient, which may be parted in these 3 parts, 2, 2, 3, or 3, 3, 1, each of which being less then half of 7. How to make water in a glass seem to boyl and sparkle. TAke a glass near full of water, or other liquor, and setting one hand upon the foot of it to hold it fast, turn slightly one of the fingers of your other hand upon the brim, or edg of the glass,
having before privately wet your finger, and so passing softly on with your fin∣ger in pressing a little: for then first the glass will begin to make a noise: secondly, the parts of the glass will sen∣sibly appear to tremble, with notable rarification, and condensation: thirdly, the water will shake, seem to boyl: fourthly, it will cast it self out of the glass, and leap out by small drops, with great astonishment to the standers by, if they be ignorant of the cause of it, which is only in the rarification of the parts of the glass, occasioned by the motion and pressure of the finger. Of the Play at Nine Pins. YOu will scarce beleeve, that with one Boul, and at one blow, playing freely, one may strike down all the nine Pins at once: yet from Mathematical
Principles it is easie to be demonstrated, that if the hand of him that plays was so well assured by experience, as reason induceth one thereto, one might at one blow strike down all the nine Pins, or at least 7 or 8, or such a number as one pleaseth. For they are but 9 in all, disposed or placed in a perfect square, having three every way: Let us suppose then that a good Player beginning to play at 1, somewhat low, should so strike it, that it should strike down the Pins 2 and 5, and these might in their violence strike down the Pins 3, 6 and 9, and the Boul being in motion may strike down the Pins 4 and 7, which 4 Pin may strike the Pin 8, and so all the nine Pins may be striken down at once.
Any Numbers under 10 being thought upon, to finde what Numbers they were. LEt the first number be doubled, and unto it add 5, and multiply that sum by 5, and add to it 10, and the next number thought upon: Multiply this same again by 10, and add to it the next number, and so proceed. Now if the last sum be told, mark if one number was thought upon, then substract 35 from it, and the first figure in the place of Tens is the Number thought upon. If he thought upon two figures, then substract 35 also, and the 2 also, the said 35 from the last sum, and the two figures that remain are the numbers thought upon. If he thought upon 3 figures, then substract 350, and then the 3 first figures are the numbers thought upon, &c.
Example. If one thought upon these figures, 5. 7. 9. 6. Double the first, which is 5, and it makes 10, to which add 5, it makes 15; This 15 multiplyed by 5, makes 75. To this 75 add 10, it makes 85. To this 85 add the next number, viz. 7, it makes 92. This 92 multiplyed by 10, makes 920, to which add the next figure, viz. 9, it makes 929. This multiplyed by 10, makes 9290. To which add 6, being the last number, it makes 9296. From which substract 3500, and there resteth 5796, the four numbers thought upon. Now because in the figures 9296, the tw last numbers are like the two thought upon; to avoyd suspicion bid him add 12, o any number to it, and then it will not be so open: As for ex∣amp, the 12 being added to 9296, it maks 9308; from which if you sub∣stract
3512, there will remain 5796, the four figures thought upon, as be∣fore. How many Changes in Bells may be easily told. SEt down 1, and under 1 set down 2; Then multiply 1 by 2, it is 2; that is 2 Changes in two Bells: Then set down 3 under 2, and multiply 2 by 3, it is 6: So there is 6 Changes in 3 Bells. Do thus: 1 2 3 6 4 24 Then put down 4 under 6, thus: Multiply 6 by 4, and it is 24. So there is 24 Changes in 4 Bells. 120 Changes in 5 Bells. 720 in 6 Bells. 5040 in 7 Bells.
40320 in 8 Bells. 362880 in 9 Bells. 3628800 in 10 Bells. The Changes in 3 Bells stand thus. 1 2 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 2 1 Here is 6 Chan∣ges in three Bells.
