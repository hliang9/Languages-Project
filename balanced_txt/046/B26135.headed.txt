Be it Enacted by the Right Honourable the Lord Maior and the Aldermen his Brethren, and the Commons in this Common Council assembled, and by Autho∣rity of the same, That the former Act made by this Court the fifth day of September in the year of our Lord, One thousand six hundred seventy and two, concerning the Regulation of the Publick Markets of this City, and every Article and Clause therein be repealed, and the same are hereby repealed, and that the Rules, Orders and Directions hereafter prescribed be duly observed by all persons that are or may be concerned therein. And first, whereas by former Acts of Common Council, the Sale of Beef hath been restrained and appointed to be only in Leaden-Hall; which if now observed, would be very inconvenient to the Inhabitants of this City, in regard the late Butchery of the Stocks and St. Nicolas Shambles, which heretofore furnished with Beef and other FleshVictuals, those parts of the City, are now removed and otherwise disposed of, according to the Directions of a late Act of Parliament. Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every Country Butcher and Butchers, Poulterer and Poulterers, Country Farmers, Victuallers, Laders or Kidders (except such Butchers and Poulterers as do or shall keep any Butchers or Poulterers Shop or Shops within the City of London or Liberties thereof, or within two Miles distance of the same) may from and after the Publication of this Act, use, occupy and employ such Standings, Stalls or Places in each respective Market as shall be provided for them, by and with the Consent and Dire∣ction of the respective Collectors, only for the time being, of each respective Market, and there sell, utter and put to open shew or sale his; her or their Beef, Mutton, Veal, Lamb, Pork, Bacon and other Butchery or Poultry Wares, or other Country Provisions, upon such days of the week, and at such times, and in such manner as is herein after expressed and no otherwise, viz. Vpon Mundays, Wednesdays and Fridays weekly; from Six of the clock in the Morning until Eight of the clock in the Evening of the same days; and upon every Saturday from Six of the clock in the Morning until Ten of the clock at Night, for so long time only as he, she or they shall furnish the said Markets, Stalls, Standings and Places with wholsom Flesh, Victual and other Provisions, in his, her or their own right, and not as Servant or Servants, or otherwise, in be∣half of any others, any thing in any former Act of Common Council, or any other Law, Custom or Vsage of this City contained, to the con∣trary thereof in any wise notwithstanding. Provided always, that it shall not be lawful for any Butcher or Poulterer, who doth inhabit or reside within the City of London or Liberties thereof, or within two miles distance of the same, to sell, utter, put or expose to open shew or sale, any Butchery or Poultry Wares, or other Provisions whatsoever, in any of the said respective Markets, upon any Friday throughout the year, upon pein that every such Butcher or Poul∣terer, for every time he, she or they shall sell, utter, put or expose to open shew or sale any Butchery or Poultry Wares in any of the said Markets upon any Friday in any week throughout the year, shall for every such Offence forfeit and pay the sum of Ten shillings. And to the end the respective hours aforesaid may be the better known and observed in the said Markets, Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Market-Bell in each respective Market shall ring thrice every Market-day, (that is to say) the first Ringing of the Market-Bell to be at Six of the clock in the Morning, for all House-keepers and others who are no Retailers of Victual, to buy in their Provisions: And the second Ringing of the said Bell to be at Ten of the clock in the Forenoon of every such Market-day, for giving notice for all such as are Re∣tailers and Traders of this City, who buy to sell again, then to enter into any of the said Markets and not before, and there to buy and carry away such Provisions as they want or stand in need of: And the third and last Ringing of the said Bell, for raising the said Markets, to be at Eight of the Clock in the Evening of the same day, except on Saturdays, and then the last Ringing of the aforesaid Bell for raising the Market, to be at Ten of the clock of the same night. And if any Butcher or Butchers, Poulterer or Poulterers, Victuallers, Country-Farmer, Lader, Kidder, or other person whatsoever shall sell, put or expose to open shew or sale any manner of Butchery or Poultry Wares or other Provisions in the said Markets or any of them before the Ringing of the Bell at the aforesaid Hour of Six in the morning, such Offender or Offenders shall be proceeded against as Fore-stallers of the Market, as by the Law in that case is directed and appointed. And if any Butcher, Poulterer, Victualler, Country-Farmer, Lader, Kidder or other person or persons whatsoever, shall sell and put or expose to open shew or sale any Butchery, Poultry Wares, or other Provisions, in any of the said Markets, after the Ringing of the Bell at the said several hours in the Evening respectively, and shall not then depart from and quit the said respective Market, such Offender or Offenders shall for every such Offence forfeit and pay the sum of Twenty shillings. And if any Retailer or Trader in this City, who buy to sell again, do come into any of the said Markets to buy or cause to be bought, or carry away or cause to be carried away, any of the Provisions brought into the Market to be sold, to his, her or their respective Hou∣ses or Shops, before the Ringing of the Bell at Ten of the clock in the Forenoon aforesaid, such Offender or Offenders shall for every such Offence forfeit and pay Forty shillings: The Markets being most principally intended for the Benefit and Advantage of House-keepers and others; who buy for their own use to be spent in their Families, and may provide for themselves in the morning at the best hand, and pay moderate Rates for their Provisions.
And forasmuch as it hath been found by great experience, that the bringing in of Victuals and other Provisions into the Common Markets of this City in the Evening of the Market-days, under pretence of supplying the said Markets, hath been a great hinderance to the well ordering of the said Markets, and occasioned the undue vending of unwholsom Victuals, to the great prejudice of this City: Be it Enacted by the Au∣thority aforesaid, That from and after the Publication of this Act, no Butcher, Poulterer, Country-Farmer, Lader, Kidder or other person or persons whatsoever, shall upon the Saturday in any week throughout the year, bring into any of the said Markets any manner of Flesh-meat or other Victuals or Provisions to be sold, after Three of the Clock in the Afternoon of the same day, upon pein that every such Offender or Of∣fenders shall for every such Offence forfeit and pay the sum of Twenty shillings.
