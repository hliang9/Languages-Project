THE MILITARY GARDEN, OR INSTRVCTIONS FOR ALL YOVNG SOVLDIERS AND SVCH WHO ARE DISPOSED TO LEARNE, AND HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MILITARIE DISCIPLINE. Wherein are set downe the conditions and qualities which are required in every severall officer of a private company. Observed and set in order according to the best Military practise by IAMES ACHESONE Gentleman at Armes, Burges of EDINBVRGH. EDINBVRGH Printed by IOHN WREITTOUN Anno DOM. 1629. Cum privilegio REGALI.
TO THE RIGHT VER∣TVOVS AND WORSHIPFVL DAVID AKENHEAD, PROVEST, IOHN SINCLAIRE, ARCHBALD TOD, EDWARD FORKER, ALEXANDER HERIOT BALLIES; IOHN MAKNATH Dane of Guild; DAVID MAKALL Treasurer: and to all the remnant of the Councell of the Towne of EDINBVRGH. RIght vertuous and worthshipfull, having by your direction trained vp and practized in the milita∣rie discipline, the youth of this most flourishing Towne, and now for the common good being to publish to the World those precepts which I had privatlie taught all them that would learne of mee; I thought I could not more deservedly present the fruites of my laboures to any than vnto that Towne to which I was so much oblished, and to you which were so carefull to haue your Burgesses made able, as well for Warre as Peace. As the Governour of this World hath apointed Life and Death, Summer and Winter, Day and Night, and almost given evrie thing a contrarie, so hath hee made Peace and Warre to haue an interchanging course on the face of this earth. Though Peace bee alwayes to bee de∣sired, yet Warre is to bee provided for, and the youth when it should fall forth (for the chasticement of People) is to be trai∣ned
therevnto. All civill lawes and orders, if there were no defence prepared to maintaine them, were no better than beau∣tifull Pallaces destitute of Roofes to hold out the violence of storme. What haue the most peacefull Comonwealths beene without trained Souldiers, but a pray to some stronger? It is set downe as a blemish in Constantin the great, that at the de∣sire of some (too peacefull) subjects, hee cassired the auncient Legions, and in them overthrew the Militarie discipline of Rome, leaving a breach for barbarous nations to invade the Empyre; not considering how lawes, justice, subjects, and the whole Bodie of the estate lie vnder the protection of Armes, as by a mighty forteresse. cap.  25. Salomon in tyme of Peace prepared armes and cha∣riots: None dare doe wrong to that nation which they know it ready prepared,Chron. 2. cap. 1. 14. cap. 9. 25. and promptlie furnished for Warre. If GOD shall moue the posteritie to continue this noble exercise, which yee in this tyme haue so happelie begunne, there are faire hopes, that as this Towne is the chiefe of this laend, so shall it be farr: aboue many, and equall if not exceed the braue number of Soul∣deours, that haue with losse of tyme and blood followed the Warres in forraine partes of the earth. To which they may bee stirred vp, if there were some plot of ground alloted to bee a militarie Garden for the training vp of the rude youth: which the Kings M. desired most earnestlie to be done, knowing how the youth of Scotland is not inferiour to any living in courage: To which worthie purpose I found the most and best of the com∣mons most willing and well affected. By this meanes, of weake citi∣zens yee shall haue strong, of timorous couragious, of idle labo∣rious, and for a People which scarce are able to sustaine a de∣sensiue Warre against invaders, a Nation reddie to offend any stranger kingdomes abroad. Thus hoping yee will accepte of this tractise with the same minde that it is presented vnto you, I pray Almightie GOD to prospere, and make ever flowrish this Towne with a race of such Worthie and Vertuous Magistrats and Councellours as yee are, which now this present yeere governe it. Yours ever to command. IAMES ACHESONE.
THE MILITARIE GARDEN. AS naturall things are conserved by comelie dis∣position, so ARTE which followeth nature is most maintained by the same: Confusion is the mother of mischiefe, and nothing can be strong where disorder is admitted either to giue coun∣sell or to command. So long every common∣wealth and pollicie hath beene able to stand, as it hath found Citizens submit themselues to the authoritie of the lawes and the power of Magistrats; and so long may wee hope to haue happie successe in the exercise of Armes, as these who professe to follow the same, shall bee readie and willing to keepe that station wherein their merits hath placed them: but that it may bee knowne what is required of every one in his office, I shall touch alittle their severall dueties accor∣ding to the order and place they carry; first, A CAPTAINE. A Captaine should consider that he hath the charge of mens liues committed to his hands over the which hee should watch, least any of them bee lost vnder his conduct either by rashnesse or want of knowledge, which should bee more easilie performed if skilfull and sufficient men were chosen to beare rule, and such as either had passed▪ or at least did vnderstand the degrees of all the inferiour officers, whereby
hee may bee able to discharge a place of such importance, that hee may presentlie redresse any thing amisse, and giue in∣instructions, and orders vpon every new accident, either in marching, encamping, or fighting, what the said officers haue to doe, for no man is able to teach that which he hath not himselfe before learned: for if hee haue not experience (by his ignorance) a whole company may be overthrowne, hee must diligentlie vse his Souldiers to the often vsing of their armes, which shall bee more profitable vnto them than the asistance of the Physitians, for dayly practise and exercise makes them both perfite and healthfull, and at last victori∣ous in the fields in tyme of battell. LEIVETENANT. HEE that is elected vnto this office, ought to bee a man of great experience, fidelitie, and valour, who in the ab∣sence of his Captaine carryeth his place, charge, and com∣mand, vnto whom the Souldiers and vnder officers are to obey for the tyme, as vnto the Captaine himselfe. His place of March, his Captaine being present, is in the reare of the Company, but in retiring or marching out of the Field, hee is to march in the Front, and the Captaine in the Reare. THE HANDSIGNE. THE Handsigne is the foundation of the Company, where∣in consisteth the honour and reputation of the Captaine and Souldiers, hee ought not onely to bee a good Souldier, bold and valiant, but as neere as may bee the Captaines equall, in valour, discretion, and counsell. His place of march is vpon the head of the Pickes, the same place hee must obserue in set Battells, but rather be∣tuixt the third and fourth Rankes.
THE SERGEANT. IN this officer consisteth the principall partes of the ob∣servation of military discipline, and for that the execu∣tion of the supperiour officers orders, and commands, doe concerne his charge and duety, it importeth that hee bee a skillfull and valiant Souldier, and well experienced in Mili∣tary discipline, yea of so great importance, that more to∣lerable it were for all the officers of the company (were it the Captaine himselfe) to bee vnskilled men and of little ex∣perience, rather than the Sergeant, who of necessitie ought to bee an expert Souldier, and of great spirit and diligence. Hee is to ranke the Souldiers as hee shall thinke good, not suffering them to contend or fall out amongst themselues for the Front or best places. THE CORPORALL. AS hee is a degree aboue the privat Souldier, so ought he in skill, let no man that is a Souldier, seeke to come to preferment in any office in the Field, except hee know him∣selfe fit to discharge the same, or els hee shall become a laughingstock to others, and be contemned of all men, as he justlie deserues, that taketh vpon him more than hee is able to performe. I thought to haue written more at large of every officer but for brevities sake I haue but onely touched every one apart, hoping God-willing my selfe to showe it more at large by my selfe vnto them in exercise which I hope will worke more in them than writting. So wishing all to take this in good part, not set foorth for the well experimented Souldier, but for such as yet haue not tasted thereof. Heereafter followeth how a Company should march, as lykewayes the severall words of Commands for ex∣ercising a Company, with their reasons.

The words for the Musquet. The Musquet shouldered.The po∣sturs of the Mus∣quet. 1. Sinke your Musquet.Charge. 2 Handell your Musquet with your right hand. 3 Vnshoulder your Musquet and hold her vp. 4 Fall backe with your right leg and hand. 5 Bring your rest to your Musquet. 6 Ioyne both in your left hand. 7 Hold your Musquet mouth over your leaders right shoulder. 8 Open your pan with right finger and thumb. 9 Take your pryming wyre and clense your touchholl. 10 Blow your pan. 11 Morse with powder. 12 Clese your pan. 13 Grip the but-end of your Musquet and rest with your right hand and shake off the loose powder. 14 Bring about your Musquet to your left syde. 15 Discharge your measure into your barrell. 16 Draw foorth your scrow or ramming sticke with the middle finger and thumb of the right hand. 17 Shorten the same at your right pappe within a handfull. 18 Ram in your powlder, furring, and bullet. 19 Draw foorth your scrow and shorten it as before. 20 Put vp your scrow in its place. 21 Recover your Musquet and hold it vp with your left hand. 22 Take it bee the butt hard at the pan and shoulder it. 23 Your rest being in your left hand with your thumb vpon it aboue the butt. 24 Sinke your Musquet.Discharge. 25 Handell your Musquet. 26 Vnshoulder your Musquet. 27 Hold vp your Musquet. 28 Bring your rest to your Musquet.
29 Ioyne both in your left hand. 30 Take foorth your match with the finger and thumb of the right hand. 31 Blow your match vnder your right arme. 32 Cocke your match. 33 Try your match to your pan. 34 Guard your pan with the first two fingers of the right hand and the thumb at the backe of the pan. 35 Blow your match againe. 36 Take off your pan. 37 Present your Musquet vpon your rest, your left foote being at the rest vpon the ground. 38 Giue fire. 39 Fall off either be the right or left hand, as the Command is given. 40 In going off take foorth your match, and returne it in your left hand againe, betwixt your little finger and middle finger, or in both, having two ends lighted. In service all this being learned and practi∣sed in exercise, there is but only three words of Command, viz. make red∣die. 2. present. 3. giue fire. The postures of the Picke. Your Picke lying vpon the ground going to list it vp. 1 PVt your toe of your right foote first to it. 2 Then your right hand with your thumb at the but-end of it. 3 In lifting step forward with your left foote and left hand and so lift it vp. 4 Then your Picke is mounted.
5 Ordour your Picke at 3. 6 Mount your Picke at 3. 7 Shoulder your Picke at 3. 8 Mount your Picke at 3. 9 Port your Picke at 1. 10 Traile your Picke at 4. 11 Cheeke your Picke at 1▪ 12 Recover your Picke at 4. 13 Port your Picke at 1. 14 Mount your Picke at 3. 15 Sinke your Picke at 1. The but-end being at halfefoote to the ground. 16 Hold your Picke vpon your right shoulder with your right hand, and your thumb vpon your shoulder, the palme of your hand vp, and your foure fingers lying aboue the Picke. 17 Vpon a long march and vpon double distance in rankes, you may carry your Picke levill vpon your shoulder but not so comely as sinked. 18 Your Picke being ordoured at close ordour the but-end of it must bee betwixt your feete, holding the same with your left hand, being ready to present to charge horse, and your right hand to draw your sword, setting forward your left foote laying your Picke, and left hand vpon your left knee the butt being close at the right foote and your sword in your right hand. 19 Your Picke being ordered at open ordour your feete must bee a foote a sundrie and your Picke in your right hand, with thumb vp, and the Picke a foote from your right foote. 20 Your Picke being ordered at order your feete may be close at halfe a foote, and the butt of your Picke at the toe of your right foote a little distance from it. When you come to vnderstand distances of Rankes and strings these Will bee more clearer.
AS for the presenting and charging of your Picke when wee come to the exercising of the Pickes, the whole forme shall bee showne God willing, which can not be done but by practise and vse of exercise. The first principall in Military instructions, bindeth every one that myndes to practise in Military discipline, after the handling of his armes, to vnderstand the severall soundes of the Drumme, without the which no Souldier is able to knowe his commanders pleasure when to march, charge or make a retreat &c. for when the commanders voyce can not ex∣tend to the hearing of the company, the Drumme denunceth and expresseth the same. The soundes especially to bee learned are these. viz. A Gathering. A March. A Troupe. A Charge. A Retreat &c. THE second principall is to knowe how to offend and and defend after the learning of his Armes, the readiest and easiest way with skill. The third principall to be learned, is the distance and or∣der of standing and marching that is to bee observed be∣tweene strings and ranks, which is a speciall poynt of disci∣pline, some make fiue sort, but I content mee onlie with three most in vse. Distance in Strings. Order is three foote. Open order is six foote. Close order is a foote and halfe.
Distance in Ranks. Order is six foote. Open order is tuelue foote. Close order is three foote. Great is the necessitie of the learning of this principall, for if order and perfect forme be not observed, it can be tearmed no other thing but a disordered company. In the next place, let the Souldier know how to distin∣guish betwixt every severall place in the company, as follow∣eth. The Front. The Front is alwayes where the faces of the company are directed all one way. The Reare. The Reare is ever where the backes of the whole com∣pany are turned. A String. A String is a sequence of men standing one behind ano∣ther, back to bellie, and consisteth commonlie of 10, or 8, or sometyme 6 depth. A Ranke. A Ranke is a raw of men, standing one by another, shoul∣der to shoulder, their faces being directed all one way. Leaders of Strings. Leaders of Strings are these that are in the first ranke; e∣very one in the same ranke is a leader of a string. Bringers vp. Bringers vp, these that are in the last ranke are called bringers vp, every one being a bringer vp of a string. Reare division, half strings, or sixt rank, all these three names may bee given to this division. The Leaders of the reare division are the sixt ranke, if their bee ten depth, if but eight, the fift ranke. Also this di∣vision is called by some middle-men, but the most sure be∣ing
what depth they will, reare division separats best, and is soone knowne. The wing. The wing is the side of the company from the front to the reare, the right side being called the right wing, and the left side the left wing. Heereafter followeth certaine ge∣nerall observations. Let every Souldier know that in marching they are to follow their leaders in strings, as also keepe even with their right hand man, which is their leader in ranke, the like must bee done vpon a stand, to stand right after their leaders in string, and ranke even with their right hand man in ranke, observing true distance and forme according vnto such order as shall bee enjoyned by the commander. Let the Pickeman know that in a march hee must alwayes shoulder his picke, either just or sinking, as the word shall be given; and comming thorow any port or gate, hee is to port his pick, vpon a troupe hee must carry his picke moun∣ted, and vpon a stand let him alwayes set downe or order his picke, vnlesse he haue command to the contrary. Let the Pickeman further know and obserue that in charging (being ten depth) half the ranks or front division are to charge or present their pickes, the other half or reare division are to carry their pickes mounted or ported over the heads of their leaders, that they bee no hinderance to them, either in char∣ging or in retiring. Obserue likewayes that when they present standing to fall backe with the right foote, and marching to present the left foote being stopped fordward. The Musquetier must obserue vpon a march to shoulder his Musquet, and carry the rest in his right hand except he prepare to giue fire, then is he bound to carry his rest in his left hand: the like also in a troupe, but in a stand let him
ever rest his musquet, except he haue command to the contrary. In exercising of the company, first cause the bodie to stand in good order, and being in such order as they are enjoyned to, let them face to the right or left hand, and so looke vpon them round, seing them stand right in strings, and ranks. Ten ranks and fiue strings face them to either hand, and then their is as many strings as ranks were before; the strings being become ranks, and the ranks being converted into strings. When you double your strings to any hand, by doubling of ranks to the contrary hand, they are brought to their first forme: likewayes having doubled ranks to any hand, by doubling of strings to the contrary hand, they become to their first order, or as they were. Now the next for the fift principall shall bee expressed, the most vsuall words of command, especially vsed in the ex∣ercising of a company, with the reasons thereof, which e∣very Souldier must bee well acquented with all, otherwayes they can never rise vnto any preferment. The words of Command following. 1. Strings double to the right. Doubling of strings to the right is after this manner, the vtmost string moveth not, but standeth fast: the next string vnto the right string moveth into the right string, so that of ten in deepe it is now become twentie, accordingly every se∣cond string moveth into their next string on their right hand. 2. Strings double to the left. The left string must stand fast, and every second string is to moue into their next string on their left hand. The vse. Thus you strengthen your wings. 3. Ranks double to the right. In doubling of ranks you must know the formost ranke stands fast, the second moveth into the first, to the right
hand (for that is commounlie first done in exercising) the third ranke standeth fast, the fourth moveth into the thrid, and so of the rest, every second ranke moveth into the ranke before them, that of fiue in ranke they are doubled and become ten in ranke. 4. Ranks double to the left. Doubling of ranks to the left, every second ranke moveth, passing vp by their leaders left hand, and so stand in the ranke with them, beginning at the front first, and so take it one from another. Note that in doubling to any hand, in going to your first order that you fall out with the con∣trare foote. The vse. Thus you strengthen your front. 5. Strings close Being in open order, the word is strings close without nameing to any hand, which is thus performed, the two middle leaders close first, the one to the right, the other to the left, till they are in the distance commanded, the rest of of the company to take their distance from them, on either wing closing to the middle leaders. 6. Strings close to the right. The right hand string moveth not but standeth fast, all the rest close to the right string, taking their distance one from another, from the right hand. 7. Strings close to the left. Strings closing to the left, then the left string stands fast, the rest of the strings close, and take their distance from the left hand. Their is great vse in closing of strings for many causes. 8. Strings close to the right and left by division. Strings closing to the right and left by division, the one half of the strings close to the right string, the other half to
the left string, leaving a space betweene, which is done vpon some speciall vse best knowne to the Commander. 9. Strings open. Being in close order, the word is, strings open (not na∣ming to whether hand) and is thus to bee done, the mid∣dle leaders presse vpon their wingers, first taking the distance commanded, having then opened both wayes, the rest of the company on both wings take their distance from them. 10. Strings open to the right. The left string is not to moue but standeth fast, the next to the left string first taketh the distance, pressing vpon the right, vntill the distance commanded bee obtained, the rest of the strings doe the like pressing vpon their right, still o∣pening by the righ vntill they haue all done it. 11. Strings open to the left. The right string standeth fast, the rest open to the left, still pressing vpon their left string vntill they are all in di∣stance commanded. This word of command is ever given to that hand where there is most ground, or fittest ground for conveniencie. 12. Ranks close from the front to the Reare. After this manner, the reare (or last ranke) moveth not but standeth fast, the rest of the ranks fall backe to the reare. 13. Ranks close from the reare to the front. To doe this, the first ranke moveth not, but standeth fast, all the rest of the ranks close vp, taking their distance commanded, ranke after ranke from the front, (or first rank) the second ranke to the front beginning first, the rest con∣sequently one after another, till all haue done it. 14. Ranks open from the front to the reare. The first ranke moveth not, the rest of the ranks fall
backe, till they haue gained the ground to the distance com∣manded, then stand, the second ranke taketh the distance first, the rest in like manner one from another, vntill they haue all effected it. 15. Ranks open from the reare to the front. Which is thus done, all the body advanceth ford-ward, the last ranke onely standeth fast, the second to the last ta∣keth the distance first, then the rest advancing fordward till they haue done it. 16. Strings and ranks close. The whole body being at open order, the word is strings and ranks close, to doe the which your middle leaders of strings close first, the rest of the strings close to them, the ranks close all vp to the front, or the first ranke to such distance as is commanded. 17. Strings and ranks open. The whole body being close in ranke and string, the word is, strings and ranks open after this maner: the mid∣dle leaders of strings open, and take the distance first, the rest of the strings on either wing from them, the ranks fall backe, the second to the front taketh the distance first, the rest in like maner from the front to the reare backwards. 18. Strings countermarch and maintaine ground. To countermarch and maintaine ground, the leaders of every string, having turned to the hand directed (which is specially to bee observed) passe thorow the company, their followers march vp to the leaders ground, making the same good, then turne and passe thorow the company after their leaders, till they haue all done the same. 19. Countermarch and lose ground. To countermarch and lose ground, the leaders of everie string, turne to the hand directed, passing thorow the com∣pany,
the followers moue not till their leaders are passed by them, then they turne and passe after their leaders, the ranks doe the same one after another, not moving till their leaders are passed by them, then they turne in the same ground. By countermarch the reare may become the front, in the same ground that the front stood in, having brought them vp, and face about. Note. The strings must bee in their open or∣der when they countermarch. 20. Rankes countermarch from the right to the left. The right hand man passeth betweene the first and second ranke, all the rest of the same ranke follow, the right hand man of the second ranke passeth betweene the second and third ranks, passing to the left wing the rest of the ranke follow him, all the rest of the ranks doe the like, bringing the right to the left. 21. Ranks countermarch from the left vnto the right. The left hand man of every ranke turneth first, passing to the right, all the ranke followeth him, the rest of the ranks doe the like, so bringing the left wing to the right. This is done vpon some politick respect of the comman∣der to change the wing, doubting the courage of the one by the other, or otherwayes best knowne to the Commander. 22. Strings ranke 3. 5. 7. or 9. The right hand string first executs the same, advancing fordward, and fall in ranke to such number as shall bee en∣joined, the next string doeth the like, advancing fordward fall in ranke after the former string, the rest of the strings keepe the same forme and order, vnto they are all ranked. 23. Strings ranke 3. 5. or 7. The left string first advanceth, falling in ranke, the rest of
the strings obserue the like forme, till the words of com∣mand bee fully executed. 24. Ranks ranke 4. 6 or 8. The first ranke executeth the same beginning at the right hand man, the first ranke having ended, the right hand man of the second ranke beginneth, the rest of the ranks doe the like, till all haue done it. 25. Ranks ranke 2. 4 or 6. The left hand man first beginneth heere, the rest of the ranks joyne with him, making so many in ranke as shall be commanded, every ranke passing vp till they haue all done it. 26. Ranks string to the right. The right hand man of every ranke stirreth not, but the next to the right hand man falleth behind his right hand man: the rest of the ranks follow: all the ranks doe the same, falling behind their right hand man, making one string of the whole company. 27. Ranks string to the left. Every left hand man stands fast, the rest fall behind one another to the left hand, and so are converted into one string. The vse. Thus you giue a strong charge vpon the wing by facing to any hand: this serveth also for a narrow passage, to doe this let the ranks bee in open order, and the strings in close order. 28. Ranks turne to the right. The right hand man turneth in the same ground he stands, not moving foorth of the same: the rest of the same ranke turneth altogether and become all aboue him, the left hand man being vppermost, all the ranks doe this. 29. Ranks turne to the left. The left hand man turneth in the same ground he stands in, the rest become all aboue him, the right hand man being vppermost, all the ranks doe this.
The vse. By this you may giue a charge by either wing very easily. Note. To performe this easily and shortly, let the strings be in their close order, and the ranks in such open order as shall be requisit according to the number of men in ranke. 30. Ranks and strings turne to the right, the great turne. This word of command is spoken to the whole body, know that the right hand man moveth not but alittle and slowlie, the left wing somewhat faster, but all the whole body together till such tyme as the left wing bee brought about, and then halt, their faces being all one way. 31. The great turne to the left. Then the left hand man moveth but litle and slowly, all the rest of the body turne together, the right wing being brought to the left. 32. The great turne right about to the reare. The right hand man moveth but little and slowlie, as it is said before, vntill his face be at the reare, then standeth. 33. The great turne left a∣bout to the reare. The like doeth the left hand man as the right did before, vntill all bee turned. The vse. Thus the front is brought to either of the wings, or to the reare, being strongest and best armed. Note. For turning of this great turne, the whole body must bee at their close order, both in ranks and strings. 34. Reare division, half strings, sixt ranke, or middle-men double the front to the right.
I haue showed you before of these four words of com∣mand, but tend all to one purpose. Therefore I say reare division double the front to the right, the leaders of this division are according to the deep∣nesse, the just half of the number, and they passe vp every man of the ranke by the right hand of his leader, vntill they haue all done, and then stand in the front or first ranke, the next ranke followeth and standeth in the second ranke, and so the rest, till all haue done it. 35. Reare division double the front to the left. The leaders of this division or first ranke of it passeth vp vpon the left hand of their leaders vnto the front or first ranke of the front, and so consequently all the rest, vntill all bee doubled. The vse. There is a speciall vse of this motion, for by this the same order in distance of ranks is still observed, which can not bee in doubling of ranks. The second vse. Againe they bring sufficient men into the front and reare. The third vse. Thirdly it maketh the company to show faire vpon a march thorow a Citie, or place of note, for faces to any hand being thus doubled and then march, and you shall bee brauely winged. 36. Reare division double the front to the right and left by division. The reare division divide themselues, the one halfe of them face to the right hand, the other halfe face to the left hand, then march out both to the wing of the company, then face againe to the right and left, then march vp to the front, and stand there.
The vse.Thus the front is doubled on either wing, and the same distance betweene strings and ranks still observed. 37. Reare division double the front to the right enteare. The reare division face to the right hand altogether, then march foorth, then face to the left hand and march vp to the front, joyning ranke by ranke and their stand. 38. Reare division double the front to the left enteare The reare division face to the left and then passe out, then face to the right and march vp to the front, joyning ranke by ranke to the wing and stand. The vse. Thus the front is enlarged by such wing as the comman∣der thinkes fitt, and shall bee most vsefull. 39. Bringers vp double the front to the right. The last ranke (as formerly is showne) are bringers vp▪ who passe thorow the body by the right hand to the front, and there stand the second to the reare, follow the bringers vp, and stand in the second ranke to the front, and so the rest till they haue all done it. 40. Bringers vp double the front to the left. The last ranke passeth vp by their leaders left hand to the first ranke and their stand, the second ranke to the reare fol∣low and stand in the second ranke to the front, all the ranks doe the like vntill they haue all done it. The vse. This is another maner of doubling the front, and not the worst: for by this, their is sufficient men brought to the front to the strengthning of the same. By this word of command you may alter the front, and bring the reare to the front, by causing the reare or last
ranke which are bringers vp to passe thorow the company▪ the rest of the ranks following them. 41. Ranks string by inversion. After this maner the whole body standing in open order, especiall in ranks, one half of the ranks fall into the right string the other half into the left hand string, becomming two strings onely, wherein you must note that the two vt∣termost strings, which are called the right and left hand strings, they stand fast, the rest of the strings invert to them. The vse. This serues for the avoyding of cannon shot vpon the maine body, or for a gaird for some great commander to passe thorow, it is vsed also at the lodging of the Handseigne. 42 To your first order, or as you were. These words are words which bring the company to their first station or order: after everie motion foresaid wee say, either to your first order, or els as you were, which tends both to one vse. But because I vse this first word in my owne practise, I would wish all those that vseth this booke to follow it, so that there bee no diversitie. To your first order. This word of command is often vsed to perfect the body after doubling of ranks or strings, when the reare division hath doubled the front, or bringers vp haue doubled the front, after ranks turning the great turne, ranks stringing ei∣ther by conversion or inversion, and at other tymes to bring them to their first forme. The vse. The vse of this is so necessarie, that when the company can not vnderstand by any other word of command, they can more easily fall to their first order. There bee diverse other words of command generally to bee observed by the whole company in tyme of service,
or vpon any suddaine assault to cause face to any hand, or charge to any hand. The company standing in battell orderly, both in ranks and strings, and true distance in both the words of exercising are these, viz. Faces to the right. To your first order. Faces to the left. To your first order. Faces right about to the reare. To your first order. Faces left about to the reare. To your first order. PRESENTING. Present to the right. To your first order. Present to the left. To your first order. Present right about to the reare. To your first order. Present left about to the reare. To your first order. Faces to the right and left by division. To your first order. Faces to the front and reare by division. To your first order. PRESENTING. Present to the right and left by division. To your first order. Present to the front and reare by division. To your first order. There is diverse sorts of exercising of Musquetiers by themselues apart, which cannot well bee set downe but in action. The first is to winne ground vpon the enemie. The second is to lose ground, or making a retreate, and
yet offend the enemie. The third is, in marching by the enemie, and discharging vpon them by strings as they march. The fourth sort is by divyding the front and reare by di∣visions, six foote distant, and marching away by the enemie, and discharging vpon them halfe strings, the first halfe string marching thorow the division from the right to the left: the second halfe string discharging vpon the enemie, and fal∣ling by the reare or last ranke vnto the left halfe string. The fift sort is by divyding the right and left division six foote distant one from another, the first halfe rankes dischar∣ging vpon the enemie, and falling off from the right hand vnto the reare, the one halfe ranke falleth off by the right division to the reare, the left division falleth downe thorow betweene the divisions vpon the right hand vnto the reare. For brevities sake I deferre all or most kynds of frames and motions, vntill I come to the practise and exercise my selfe, which Godwilling wil be more profitable to the young Souldier, than many tables of motions, which are hinderance to the mynd. Heeretofore I haue set foorth briefly and shortly the due∣ties and partes that everie particular officer ought to bee en∣dued with, that hee may bee found qualified for the fulfil∣ling of his place, and discharging the commandement he hath over a private company. Now my discourse draweth mee a little higher to the heads, and chiefest officers in an army, by whom the whole body of the inferior companies are to bee directed; for as the senses of our body haue residence in the head to governe the rest of the body, and the sense of touching and feeing onely is spred abroad thorow the rest of the parts thereof, that every particular member may haue functions for the execution of these offices wherevnto they are appoynted by nature, even so it is in the body of an armie, from whose chiftane, as from the head should bee
deryved all sort of sense, and in the rest of the inferior mem∣bers should bee found a ready obedience to bee disposed vpon according to the influence and government that hee shall thinke most expedient: Now as the health and good order of the body depend so vpon the constitution of the head, that if it bee distempered, or the senses troubled, the actions of the whole man are of that same kynd confuted and perverted, so the proceedings of an army receaue their beginning and successe, according to the sense and vnderstan∣ding of those who governe therein, and therefore I haue thought it expedient to speake alittle of them lykewayes, that everie one at his first entrie into a campe may know how all things ought to bee rightlie governed, and to whom hee ought obedience if any thing should fall amisse, so that from the lowest degree to the highest they bee not ignorant how the rule of perfection may be aymed at and obteined. THE GENERALL. THE highest office of all is that of a Generall, who as hee is aboue the rest in authoritie and power, so ought hee not only to know perfectly the dueties of every officer, but also to excell them all in religion, wisedome, experience, policie, gravitie, secrecie, counsell, modestie, temperance, va∣lour, magnanimitie, vigilancie, care constancie, liberalitie, and resolution, with all other good partes incident to a perfect man of warre: and how much all these good parts, and ma∣ny more ought to bee in the personage elected to this high and carefull dignitie, you may easily conceaue and gather, be∣cause hee is set over the rest, to the end that he being their chiftane and head, may not onely know how to governe them both in actions, but also in his vertuous lyfe and car∣riage bee a paterne, light, and lanterne vnto the whole numbers of the companies to imitate, for it is an old pro∣verb,
such master such man, such Generall such officers and followers: for commonly a wise, valiant and vertuous gene∣rall will chuse wise valiant, and vertuous captaines and offi∣cers: good and vertuous captaines will as neere as they can chuse good, honest, sober, and vertuous officers vnder them, intertaine their Souldiers with good and faire speeches, to command with all allurements to bring them to the due forme of martiall discipline. THE CROWNER. THE Crowners place and office is to be commander over the Captaines, and all other inferior officers of his regi∣ment, having jurisdiction and dominion over them all, where∣by may bee inferred and gathered the parts and qualities which ought to bee in him, and the great skill and experi∣ence in warre, as one who ought to exceede them all, for to know how to command, rule, and governe them with pru∣dencie, and valour: And forasmuch as in many occurrants and occasions growing and presented in warre hee should know to performe the parts and office of a generall, being alone with the companies of his owne regiment, as when his generall commands him to the batterie, or seige of any fort or citie, or to defend any fort or towne, or to warre in any open campania, to giue battell to the enemie, to make incursions, to retire and withdraw skirmishers, to frame brigs over rivers, to fortifie himselfe in campe, to conduct artillirie, and many other peeces of service to bee performed in him, he is greatly to respect and honour his generall, o∣beying and performing his commands and orders with great care and diligence, as hee would bee obeyed himselfe and reverenced by his Captaines and other officers of his re∣giment.
THE SERGEANT MAIOR. HIS office is to bee the generall minister or officer of a whole regiment of sundrie companyes, and superinten∣dent of all the Sergeants of the same, by whose hand and industrie, the crowner doth giue the orders convenient to the due governement of his regiment; as in marching, en∣camping imbattelling, and in such other matters concerning heerevnto, whereby may bee gathered the parts, the quli∣ties, the valour, the great skill, experience, and great dili∣gence which ought to bee in him, who is chosen to this degree of office, being of such importance: the Ser∣geant majors office is of much higher degree than a∣ny ordinarie Captiane; for every Captaine doe receaue his di∣rections from the Sergeant major, and the Sergeant major from the Crowner or Generall if hee bee in place: the or∣dinarie place where the Crowner marcheth is in the Van∣gard, and so the Sergeant major being his officer, by whom hee sendeth his commands vnto the Captaines. Leiuetennents, Handseignes, and Sergeants, and other   alwayes to bee neere vnto his person, for   major is guide of the battell. Admonitions for a  Souldier HAving said somewhat concerni he conditions and qualities which are required in  severall officer of a privat company. Now let vs see  maner of men are worthy the name of Souldiers. First the Souldier of all men  the feare of God before his eyes, to haue a cleare , & to be of honest conversation, least in runing vp  hee fall into hell-fire.
Secondly hee that loveth right and Iustice, is sitte to bee the defender of the same. Thirdly hee that pitieth the poore and afflicted, is a meete man to succour his country and towne against the violence of oppressours. Fourthly hee that tendereth the wedow and fatherlesse▪ he that delyteth to see vertue floorish in his country, honour ad∣vanced, faith and equitie to abyde in every fellowship. Fiftly hee that hateth covetousnesse, thift, extortion, mur∣ther, fornication, idlenesse; and drunkennesse, these and such like men are fit to bee, and beare the name of Souldiers or mar∣tialists. For the first foundation and vse of armes was erected of necessitie to restraine and represse the disorders of lewd and wicked men, and to settle and establish peace and justice v∣pon earth, so then as the armed hoast is the remedie to chastice and represse the offences of others, it is convenient that the same hoast bee free from the like offences, and every vice in a Souldier ought to bee strongly bridled, and punished with extremitie.

Heere is placed the handling of Picke and Musquet, with your left hand because there is sundrie of this Towne who are left handed and de∣sirous to learne to handle both Pickes and Musquets therewith. The postures of the Picke. Your Picke lying vpon the ground going to lift it vp. 1 PVt your toe of your left foote first to it. 2 Then your left hand with your thumb at the but-end of it. 3 In lifting step forward with your right foote, and right hand and so lift it vp. 4 Then your Picke is mounted. 5 Ordour your Picke at 3. Moion. 6 Mount your Picke at 3. Moion. 7 Shoulder your Picke at 3. Moion. Which must bee done this way, first fall backe with your left foote and your left hand, receaving your Picke vpon your left shoulder, so you step vp againe with your left foote vpon your station to the right foote. 8 Mounte your Picke at 3. 9 Port your Picke at 1. 10 Traile your Picke at 4. 11 Cheeke your Picke at 1. 12 Recover your Picke at 4. 13 Port your Picke at 1. 14 Shoulder your Picke at 3. 15 Sinke your Picke, putting the but-end of it within halfe foot to the ground. 16 Hold your Picke vpon your left shoulder with your left hand, and your thumb vpon your shoulder, the palme of your hand vp

The words for the handling of the Musquet for a left handed man. The po∣sturs of the Mus∣quet.

A Souldiers resolution to brauo Souldiers. GEntlemen and braue Souldiers, having now ended all that I haue thought expedient to be set downe by writ for the present touching this matter, what amisse and error I haue herein committed, I yeelde the same to bee considred and reformed by the wisdome of those, whose experience, au∣thoritie, and good indevour may bee answerable to the per∣formance thereof: Desiring that the same may bee deemed as proceeding from a Souldier, who more of zeale than of any desire to offend, not to instruct the expert Souldier, but to indevour my selfe by the observations to make knowne my goodwill and wishes I haue conceaved, to set forward the vnexpert and vnskilled sort, which if I haue obtained, it is the hight of all my desires, and I shall esteeme this a full recompence of my travell, if I perceaue this discourse of the rudiments of Martiall affairs, to bee gratiously accepted, though it be roughlie drawne, as it were with the Picke and Musquet of a Souldier, and no trimmed with the delicate pen of an orator, for I haue ever judged it more becomming a Souldier to vtter himselfe by workes than by wordes, and in effect, as I shall doe declare the affection and readinesse I haue To doe you better service.
