THE HUMBLE REPRESENTATION AND Petition of the General Coun∣cil of the Officers of the Armies of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Wednesday 6th. April 1659. Ordered by the General Council of the Officers of the Armies of England, Scotland and Ireland, That this Representation and Petition be forthwith Printed and published. Philip Carterred Judge Advocate. LONDON, Printed by Henry Hills, one of His Highness the Lord Protectors Printers, 1659.
To His Highness Richard Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Dominions and Territories thereun∣to belonging. The humble Representation and Petition of the General Council of the Officers of the Armies of England, Scotland, and Ireland. HAving as Members of the Army often Solemnly declared not with∣out appeales to God for our since∣rity therein, That We did ingage in Judgement and Conscience for the just Rights and Liberties, Civil and Religi∣ous of our Countreys, and not as a Mercenary Army, Had we not been very jealous of our re∣putation, and Carefull to avoid Suspicion, which our many Adversaries have endeavoured to bring upon us, as if we were apt to intermed∣dle with matters not relating to an Army; We had before this time made joynt and Pub∣lique application to your Highness, therein set∣ting
forth what imediately concerns our selves, with respect to the crying necessities of the Ar∣mies, for want of pay; And withal to have ma∣nifested our fervent desires, that our good Cause in the behalf of these Nations, might have recei∣ved renewed strength and Countinance from Your Highness and this present Parliament. But Your Highness is our witness how peace∣ably, how silently we have suffered as to what concerns the Armies wants; Or what might otherwise become us in the behalf of these Nati∣ons to have laid before Your Highness. Yea we have been silent so long, that we fear it has been a disadvantage to our Cause, and bred (though we hope groundless) jealousies of us in many of our friends: And until we, and all that is dear to us, the Interest we have so long contend∣ed for, is in danger to be lost; to the utter ruine and subversion of Your Highness, together with the peace and welfare of these Nations. But being now, under the fense of imminent dangers and necessities, awakened, and also finding that Your Highness, by the sitting of this Parliament, is in a capacity to provide against the approaching danger; and upon consultation with each other, and communicating what has come to our knowledge of publick concern∣ment, and the present state of the Armies, ha∣ving unanimously agreed it to be our duty to God, to Your Highness, and our fidelity to our Countrey, Submissively, and as becomes us in our Stations, to make our application to Your Highness:
We hope it will not be interpreted an interru∣ption to any other publick Concernments under consideration; and do therefore in a deep sence of Misery and Judgement threatned, and pur∣suance of our Duty, in all humility, Represent, That the good old Cause against Tyranny and intolerable oppression in matters Civil and Re∣ligious, whereupon we first ingaged, and unto which the Lord hath in such a continued Series of Providence given so signal a Testimony, and for the carrying on whereof there hath been such a plentiful powring forth of Treasure, Prayers, Tears, and Blood during the late War (in the difficulties and dangers whereof, we also, the living Monuments of Patience, and Mercy, have had our shares) is very frequently and Pub∣lickly derided and reproached, and the inpla∣cable Adversaries thereof promise themselves to be so far in possession and Masters thereof, that they begin to appear every where visible a∣mongst us, and to mix themselves in the midsts of those places where that Cause was wont to receive its chiefest Countinance and shelter. Many old Cavaliers and Officers under the late King and Charls Stewart his Son, having lately transported themselves out of Flanders and other places into this Nation, have their frequent meetings in and neer the City of London. Those who also served under the late King, and such as have alwayes shewed themselves dis-affected to that famous long Parliament, and
ever since to the Cause and interrest of this Com∣monwealth, and seek the ruine of this present Government, have their frequent meetings in se∣veral Countries of this Nation; grow very in∣solent, offer many affronts and assaults to such as have been, and are faithful servants to this Commonwealth. Papers are scattered up and down, contein∣ing Lists of Eminent Assertors of the publick Interrest of this Nation, such as were the actual Tryers of the late King, and by whom he was brought to condign punishment, as if they were designed and marked out for destruction. Encouragement is taken for the prosecution of several Well affected persons, and Suites commenced against them at the Common Law, for matters by them transacted as Souldiers, by command from their Superiours, in order to the safety and security of the Nations. The famous Actions of the Parliament, His late Highness, of blessed memory, and the Army in and since the year 1648. vilified and evil spo∣ken of; particular persons frequently daring to speak against the Authority of Parliaments, and to call all their proceedings, and of such as act∣ed in obedience to them, illegal and unwarran∣table. So that upon the whole we evidently see there is but even a step betwixt the Publick Cause of these Nations, wherein we have been so signal∣ly blessed and owned of God and good men, and the death thereof; and that it is nor likely to
expire without a sure presage of the sad Funerals of the deer and never to be enough valued Peace of these our native Countries. And that our enemies may want nothing that can strengthen their hopes, it so happens, that the Armies are already under great extremities for want of Pay, and notwithstanding their con∣dition hath been represented, yet no effectual remedy hath been applied; our Enemies may hope discontent will be the more easily raised, if the Armies should unavoidably be necessitated upon Free Quarter. Divisions in the Armies have been attempt∣ed and well neer effected, when their wants have not been like to what is now upon them: The Officers purses being generally emptied by their Loanes to the Souldiers, their credits to the Victulars extended to the utmost; The poor Souldier sometimes inforced to sell his expected Pay much under the value thereof, for ready money to buy bread; and the great and unu∣sual Mortality of Horses in the Army (inso∣much that many Troopers have been forced to buy twice over) having brought the Horse of this Army under exceeding great extremi∣ties: And as by these means the adversaries to the Peace, Settlement, Prosperity, Civil and Re∣ligious Liberty of these Nations, are grown ve∣ry confident and high in their expectations and attempts (as we are perswaded ready to betake themselves to their Armes again) so likewise
many friends thereof are exceedingly discoura∣ged. We cannot but bewail our own great failings and turnings aside, and wherein soever we have back-sliden we have cause, and desire to take shame to our selves. And do therefore for the strengthning of Your Highness and Parliament; For the Revi∣ving the hearts of our Faithful friends, and the vindication of our own integrity against all cen∣sures and jealousies, assert; That we are now, as ever, equally indeared to our good old Cause, and utter Enemies to all Ty∣ranny, Oppression, and Disturbance of the Publick Peace under what pretences soever: And through the Lords assistance resolved, whilest our lives and present capacities are con∣tinued to us, to stand by and assist Your High∣ness and Parliament, in the plucking the wicked out of their places wheresoever they may be dis∣covered, either amongst our selves, or any o∣ther places of trust; The Reformation of Law and Manners so frequently declared for, and so earnestly expected by all sober unbiassed men. Opening the course of Justice, and Bowels of Mercy, incouraging the wayes of holiness, and putting a stop to the inundation of Malignancy and Profaneness. All which, as it hath been in Duty and Faith∣fulness by us represented, so we humbly pray, That Your Highness taking into Your serious consideration, the sad condition of the Armies,
and danger of the Nations, both from the great want of Pay, and Activity of our common E∣nemy, will be pleased to Represent these things which we have herein laid before Your High∣ness, to the Parliament, with our Humble De∣sire and Prayer, that a speedy Supply be made for the Armies, that their past Arrear may be satisfied, and care taken for their constant fu∣ture Pay, so long as it shall be thought fit to con∣tinue them; as also that satisfaction be given to the Militia Forces, and that there may be such a Publick Asserting of our good old Cause, and Ju∣stification and confirmation of all proceedings in Prosecution and Maintenance thereof, and Declaration against its Enemies, as may for the future deter all persons from Speaking or Attempting any thing to the prejudice there∣of, or of the persons that have Acted in Prose∣cution of it, and afford present security to the Civil and Religious Rights and Liberties of these Nations, and the Peace thereof; And that the Liberty of Good and Well-affected People, in repairing with Freedome to their Meetings for the Worship of God, (of late much Violated by Inditing and Imprisoning many of their Persons) may be still Asserted and Vindicated.
The Printer to the READER. Courteous Reader, THis Representation was agreed on and Signed by all the Officers both Great and Small, that are in or near London, not one dissenting, whose names should have been herewith Printed, but that they could not be written our in time: It was likewise presented to His Highness the 6th of April, 1659. by the Right Honourable the Lord Charles Fleetwood, attended with the rest of the General Council of Officers, and was most graciously accepted by His Highness, who expressed himself with much affection towards both it and them.
