The Prologue. MOst Sacred Majesty, whose great deserts, Thy subject England; nay, the world admires: Which heav'n grant still increase: O may your praise, Multiplying with your hours, your fame still raise. Embrace your Councel: Love, with Faith them guide, That both as one bench by the others side; So may your life pass on, and run so even, That your firm zeal plant you a Throne in Heaven: Where smiling Angels shall your guardians be, From blemisht Traitours, stain'd with perjurie. And as the Night's inferiour to the Day, So be all earthly Regions to your sway. Be as the Sun to Day, the Day to Night, For from your beams Europe shall borrow light: Mirth drown your bosome, fair Delight your mind, And may our pastime your contentment finde. Exit.

A most pleasant Comedy of Mucedorus the Kings Son of Valentia, and Amadine the Kings Daughter of Aragon. Enter Comedy joyfully, with a Garland of Bays on her head. WHy so thus do I hope to please; Musick revives, and mirth is tolerable: Comedy play thy part and please; Make merry them that come to joy with thee: Joy then Good Gentiles, I hope to make you laugh; Sound forth Bellona's silver tuned strings; Time fits us well, the day and place is ours. Enter Envy, his arms naked, besmeared with blood. Envy. Nay stay minion, stay, there lies a block; What all on mirth? Ile interrupt your tale, And mix your musick with a Tragick end. Comedy. What monstruous ugly nag is this, That dares controul the pleasures of our will? Vaunt churlish Cur, besmear'd with gory blood, That seem'st to check the blossom of Delight, And still the sound of sweet Bellona's breath: Blush monster, blush, and post away with shame, That seekst disturbance of a Goddess name. Envy. Post hence thy self thou counterchecking Trull, I will possess this habit spight of thee, And gain the glory of this wished Port. Ile thunder musick shall appale the Nymphs, And make them shiver their clattering strings, Flying for succour to their Danish Caves. Sound Drums within, and cry, Stab, Stab. Hearken, thou shalt hear noise Shall fill the air with shrilling sound,
And thunder musick to the Gods above: Mars shall himself breath down A peerless crown upon brave Envies head, And raise his chival with a lasting fame: In this brave musick Envy takes delight, Where I may see them wallow in their blood, To spurn at Arms and Legs quite shivered off, And hear the cries of many thousands slain: How lik'st thou this my Trull? 'tis sport alone for me. Com. Vaunt bloody Cur, nurst up with Tygers sap, That so dost quail a womans mind: Comedy is mild, gentle, willing for to please, And seeks to gain the love of all estates; Delighting in mirth, mixt all with lovely tales, And bringeth things with treble joy to pass. Thou bloody, envious, disdainer of mens joys; Whose name is fraught with bloody stratagems. Delights in nothing but in spoil and death, Where thou mayst trample in their lukewarm blood, And grasp their hearts within thy cursed paws: Yet vail thy mind, revenge thee not on me, A silly woman begs it at thy hands; Give me the leave to utter out my Play. Forbear this place, I humbly crave thee hence, And mix not death 'mongst pleasing Comedies, That treats nought else but pleasure and delight: If any spark of humane rests in thee, Forbear, be gone, tender the suit of me. Envy. Why so I will; forbearance shall be such, As treble death shall cross thee with despight, And make thee mourn where most thou joyest, Turning thy mirth into a deadly dole, Whirling thy pleasures with a peal of death, And drench thy methods in a sea of blood; Thus will I do: Thus shall I bear with thee, And more, to vex thee with a deeper spight, I will with threats of blood begin the play, Favouring thee with Envy and with Hate.
Com. Then ugly monster do thy worst, I will defend them in despight of thee: And though thou thinkest with Tragick fme To prove my Play unto my great disgrace▪ I force it not, I scorn what thou canst do▪ Ile grace it so, thy self shall it confess, From Tragick stuff, to be a pleasant Comedie. Envy. Why then Comedy send the Actors forth, And I will cross the first step of their Trade, Making them fear the very dart of death. Com. And Ile defend them mangre all thy spight; So ugly fiend farewell till time shall serve, That we may meet to parley for the best. Envy. Content Comedy, Ile go spread my branch, And scattered blossoms from mine envious Tree, Shall prove two Monsters spoiling of their joys. Exit. Sound. Enter, Mucedorus, and Anselmo his friend. Muc. Anselmo? Ansel. My Lord and friend, Whose dear affections bosome with my he, And keep their domination in one Orb; Whence near disloyalty shall root it forth, But faith plant firmer in your choise respect. Muce. Mcuh blame were mine if I should other deem, Nor can coy fortune contrary allow: But my Anselmo, loth I am to say I must enstrange that friend∣ship: Misconsture not, 'tis from the Realm, not thee: Though Lands part bodies, Hearts keep company: Thou know'st that I imparted often have Private raltions with my Royall Syre Had, as concerning beauteous Amadine, Rich Aragons bright Jewell: whose face (some say) That blooming Lillies never shone so gay: Excelling not excel'd; yet lest report Does mangle Verity, boasting of what is not Wing'd with Desire, thither Ile straight repair, And be my fortunes at my thoughts are, fair. Ansel. Will you forsake Valentia? leave the Court?
Absent you from the eye of Soveraignty, Do not sweet Prince, adventure on that task, Since danger lurks each where, he won from it. Muce. Desist dissawsion, My Resolution brooks no battery, Therefore if thou retain thy wonted form, Assist what I intend▪ Ansel. Your miss will breed a blemish in the Court, And throw a frosty dew upon that beard, Whose front Valentia stoops to. Muce. If thou my welfare tender, then no more; Let Loves strong Magick charm thy triviall phrase, Wasted as vainly as to gripe the Sun: Augment not then more answer; lock thy lips, Unless thy wisdom sre me with disguise, According to my purpose. Ansel. That action craves no councels, Since what you rightly are, will more commnd, Th best usurped shape. Muce. Thou still art opposite in disposition. A more obscure servile habiliment Beseems this enterprise. Ansel. Then like a Florentine or Mountebanke. Muc. 'Tis much too tedious, I dislike thy judgement, My mind is grafted on an humbler stock. Ansel. Within my closset does there hang a Cassock, Though base the weed is, 'twas a Shepherds, Which I presented in Lord Julius Mask. Muce. That my Anselmo, and none else but that, Mask Mucedorus from the vulgar view: That habite suits my mind, fetch me that weed. Exit Anselmo. Better then Kings have not disdain'd that state, And much inferiour, to obtain their mate. Enter Anselmo with a Shepherds coat. So, let our respect command thy secrecie, At once a brief farewell, Delay to Lovers is a second Hell. Exit. Mucedorus.
Ansel. Prosperitie fore-run thee: Auckward chance, Never be neighbour to thy wishes venture, Content and Fame advance thee. Ever thrive, And glory thy mortality survive. Enter Mouse, with a bottle of hay. Mouse. O horrible terrible! Was ever poor Gentleman so scar'd out of his seven senses? A Bear? Nay sure it cannot be a Bear, but some Devil in a Bears doublet: for a Bear could never have had that agility to have frighted me. Well, Ile see my father hang'd before Ile serve his Horse any more: Well, Ile carry home my bottle of hay, and for once make my fa∣thers Horse turn Puritan, and observe Fasting days, for he gets not a bit. But soft, this way she followed me, therefore Ile take the other path, and because Ile be sure to have an eye to her, I will shake hands with some foolish Creditor, and make every step backward. As he goes backward, the Bear comes in, and he tumbles over her, and runs away, and leaves his bottle of hay behind him. Enter Segasto running, and Amadine after him, being Pursued with a Bear. Seg. O flie Madam, flie, or else we are but dead. Ama. Help Segasto, help, help sweet Segasto, or else I die. Segasto runs away. Segast. Alas Madam there is no way but flight. Then haste and save your self. Ama. Why then I dye. Ah help me in distress. Enter Mucedorus like a Shepherd, with a sword drawn, and a Bears head in his hand. Muce. Stay Lady, stay, and be no more dismaid, That cruel beast most merciless and fell, Affrighted many with his hard pursues, Prying from place to place to find his prey, Prolonging thus his life by others death: His carkass now lies headless void of breath. Ama. That foul deformed Monster, is he dead? Muce. Assure your self thereof, behold his head.
Which if it please you Lady to accept, With willing heart I yield it to your Majestie. Ama. Thanks worthy Shepherd, thanks a thousand times. This gift assure thy sef contents me more, Than greatest bounty of a mighty Prince, Although he were the Monarch of the world. Muce. Most gratious Goddess, more than mortal wight, Your heavenly hue of right imports no less, Most glad am I, in that it was my chance To undertake this enterprise in hand, Which doth so greatly glad our princely mind. Ama No Goddess (Shepherd) but a mortall wight, A mortall wight distressed as thou seest; My father here is King of Aragon, I Amadine his only drughter am, And after him sole air unto the Crown: Now whereas it is my fathers will, To marrie me unto Segasto, One whose wealth through Fathers former usury, Is known to be no less then wonderfull; We both of custome oftentimes did use, (Leaving the Court) to walk within the fields For recreation, especially the Spring, In that it yields great store of rare delights: And passing further then our wonted walks, Scarce entered within these luckless woods, But right before us down a steepfall hill, A monstrous ugly Bear did hie him fast To meet us both: I faint to tell the rest. Good Shepherd but suppose the gastly looks, The hideous fears, the hundred thousand woes Which at this instant Amadine sustain'd. Muce. Yet worthy Princess let thy sorrow cease, And let this sight your former joys revive. Ama. Believe me Shepherd, so it doth no less. Muce Long may they last unto your hearts content, But tell me Lady, what is become of him? Segasto cal'd; what is become of him?
Ama. I know not I, that know the powers divine, But God grant this, that sweet Segasto live. Muce. Yet hard hearted he in such a case, So cowardly to save him  by flight, And leave so brave a Princess to the spoil. Ama. Well Shepherd, for thy worthy valour tried, Endangering thy self to set me free, Unrecompenced sure thou shalt not be: In Court thy courage shall be plainly known, Throughout the Kingdom will I spread thy name, To thy renoun and never dying fame: And that thy courage may be better known, Bear thou the head of this most monstrous beast, In open sight to every Courtiers view: So will the King my father thee reward. Come let's away, and guard me to the Court. Muce. With all my heart. Exeunt. Enter Segasto solus. Segast. When heaps of harms do hover over head, Tis time as then (some say) to look about, And of ensuing harms to chuse the least, But hard, yea hapless is that wretches chance, Luckless his lot, and caitiff-like accurst, At whose proceedings Fortune ever frowns: My self I mean most subject unto thrall: For I, the more I seek to shun the worst, The more by proof I finde my self accurst. Ere whiles assaulted with an ugly Bear, Fair Amadine in company all alone, Forthwith by flight I thought to save my self, Leaving my Amadine unto her shifts: For death it was for to resist the Bear, And death no less of Amadines harms to hear. Accursed I, in lingring life thus long: In living thus, each minute of an hour Doth pierce my heart with darts of thousand deaths: If she by flight her fury doth escape, What will she think?
Will she not say, yea flatlie to my face, Accusing me of meer disloyaltie. A trusty friend is tried in time of need But I, when she in danger was of death, And needed me, and cried, Segasto help, I turn'd my back and quicklie ran away, Unworthy I to bear this vital breath, But what, what need those plaints? If Amadine do live, then happy I, She will in time forgive and so forget: Amadine is merciful, not Iuno like, In harmful hearts to harbour hatred long. Enter Mouse the Clown running, crying clubs. Mou. Clubs, Prongs; Pitchforks, Bills: O help, A Bear, a Bear, a Bear. Seg. Still Bears, and nothing but Bears. Tell me sirrah where she is. Clow. O sir, she is run down the woods, I saw her white head, and her white belly. Segast. Thou talkst of wonders, to tell me of white Bears. But sirrah, didst thou ever see any such? Clow. No faith, I never saw any such: But I remember my fathers words, He bad me take heed I was not caught with the white Bear. Segast. A lamentable tale no doubt. Clow. Ile tell you what sir, as I was going a field to serve my fathers great Horse, and carried a bottle of hay upon my head: Now do you see sir, I fast hudwinkt that I should see nothing, I perceiving the Bear coming, I threw my hay into the hedge, and ran away. Segast. What from nothing? Clow. I warrant you yes, I saw something: for there was two load of thorns besides my bottle of hay, and that made three. Segast. But tell me sirrah: the Bear that thou didst see, Did she not bear a bucket on her arm? Clow. Ha, ha, ha, I never saw a Bear go a milking in all my life. But hark you sir, I did not look so high as her arm, I saw nothing but her white head, and her white belly.
Segast. But tell me sirrah: where dost thou dwell? Clow. Why do you not know me? Segast. Why no, how should I know thee? Clow. Why then you know no body, and you know not me; I tell you sir, I am goodman Rats Son of the next parish over the hill. Segast. Goodman Rats son, whats thy name? Clow. Why I am very neer kin unto him. Segast. I think so, but whats thy name? Clow. My name? I have a very pretty name. Ile tell you what my name is, my name is Mouse. Segast. What plain Mouse? Clow. I plain Mouse, without either wlt or guard. But do you hear sir, I am a very young Mouse, for my tail is scarce grown out yet; look here else. Segast. But I pray you who gave you that name? Clow. Faith Sir, I know not that, but if you would fain know ask my fathers great Horse, for he hath been half a year lon∣ger with my father than I have been. Segast. This seems to be a merry fellow, I care not if I take him home with me: Mirth is a comfort to a troubled mind. A merry man a merry Master makes. How saist thou sirrah, wilt thou dwell with me? Clow. Nay soft sir, two words to a bargain. Pray what Oc∣cupation are you? Segast. No Occupation, I live upon my lands. Clow. Your lands? away, yea are no Master for me. Why, do you think that I am so mad to go to seek my living in the lands among the stones, bryers, and bushes, and tear my holy day apparel? not I by your leave. Segast. Why, I do not mean thou shalt. Clow. How then? Seg. Why thou shalt be my man and wait on me at Court: Clow. Whats that? Segast. Where the King lies. Clow. What is that King, a man or a woman? Segast. A man as thou art. Clow. As I am: Hark you sir, pray you what kin is he to goodman King of our parish the Church warden?
Segast. No kin to him, he is the King of the whole Land. Clow. King of the whole Land! I never saw him. Seg. If thou wilt dwel with me thou shalt see him every day. Clo. Shall I go home again to be torn in pieces with Bears? No not I, I will go home and put on a clean shirt, and then go drown my self. Seg. Thou shalt not need, if thou wilt dwell with me, thou shalt want nothing. Clo. Shall I not? then heres my hand, Ile dwell with you: And harky on sir, now you have entertained me, Ile tell you what I can do, I can keep my tongue from picking and steal∣ing, and my hands from lying and slandering I warrant you as well as ever you had any man in your life. Segast. Now will I to Court with sorrowful heart, rounded with doubts: If Amadine do live, then happy I; yea happy I if Amadine do live. Enter the King with a young prisoner, Amadine, Tremelio, with Collin and Counsellors. King. Now brave Lords, our wars are brought to end, Our foes the foil, and we in safetie rest: It us behoves to use such clemency in peace, As valour in the wars; Tis as great honour to be bountiful at home, As conquerors in the field. Therefore my Lords, the more to my content, Your liking, and our Countries safeguard, We are dispos'd in Marriage for to give Our Daughter unto Lord Segasto here, Who shall succeed the Diadem after me, And reign hereafter as I tofore have done, Your sole and lawful King of Aragon. What say you Lordlings like you of my advice? Col. An't please your Majestie, we do not only allow of your Higness pleasure, but also vow faithfullie in what we may, to further it. King. Thanks good my Lords, if long Adrastus live, He will it l require your courtesies. Tremelio, in recompence of thy late valour done,
Take unto thee the Catelone a Prince, Lately our prisoner taken in the wars: Be thou his keeper, his ransome shall be thine: Wee'll think of it when leisure shall afford: Mean while do use him well, his father is a King. Tre. Thanks to your Majestie, his usage shall be such, As he thereat shall have no cause to grutch. Exit. King. Then march we on to Court, and rest our wearied limbs. But Collin, I have a tale in secret fit for thee, When thou shalt hear a watch-word from thy King, Think then some weighty matter is at hand, That highly shall concern our state, Then Collin look thou be not far from me, And for thy service thou to fore hast done, Thy truth and valour prov'd in every point, I shall with bounties thee enlarge therefore, So guard us to the Court. Col. What so my Soveraign doth command me do, With willing minde I gladly yeeld consent. Exeunt. Enter Segasto, and the Clown, with weapons about him. Seg. Tell me sirrah, how do you like your weapons? Clow. O very well, very well, they keep my sides warm. Seg. They keep the dogs from your shins well, do they not? Clow. How, keep the dogs from my shins? I would scorn but my shins should keep the dogs from them. Segast. Well Sirrah, leaving idle talk, tell me, Dost thou know Captain Tremelios chamber? Clow. I very well, it hath a door. Segast. I think so, for so hath every chamber: But dost thou know the man? Clow. I forsooth, he hath a nose on his face. Seg. Why s:o hath every one. Clo. Thats more then I know. Seg. But dost thou remember the Captain that was here with the King that brought the young Prince prisoner? Clow. O very well. Segast. Go to him, and bid him come unto me: Tell him I have a matter in secret to impart to him. Clow. I will Master, what's his name?
Segast. Why Captain Tremelio. Clow. O, the meal-man; I know him very well, He brings meal every Saturday; But hark you Master, Must I bid him come to you, or must you come to him? Segast. No sirrah, he must come to me. Clow. Hark you Master, if he be not at home, What shall I do then? Segast. Why then leave word with some of his folks. Clow. O Master if there be no body within, I will leave word with his dog. Segast. Why can his dog speak? Clow. I cannot tell, wherefore doth he keep his chamber else? Segast. To keep out such knaves as thou art. Clow. Nay by Lady then go your self. Segast. You will go sir, will you not? Clow. Yes marry will I▪ O tis come to my head: And he be not within, Ile bring his chamber to you. Segast. What, will you pluck down the Kings house? Clow. No by Lady, Ile know the price of it first. Master, it is such a hard name I have forgotten it again: I pray you tell me his name. Segast. I tell thee Captain Tremelio. Clow. O Captain treble knave, Captain treble knave. Enter Tremelio. Tre. How now sirrah, dost thou call me? Clow. You must come to my Master. Captain treble knave. Tre. My Lord Segast. did you send for me? Segast. I did Tremelio, Sirrah, about your business. Clow. I marry, whats that, can you tell? Segast. No not well. Clo. Marry then I can, straight to the Kitchin-dresser to John the Cook, and get me a good piece of Bief and Brewis, and then to the Buttery hatch to Thomas the Butler for a Jack of Beer: and there for an hour Ile so belabour my self, and there∣fore I pray you call me not till you think I have done, I pray you good Master. Exit. Segast. Well Sir, away. Tremelio. This it is, thou knowest the valour of Segasto.
Spread through all the kingdom of Aragon, And such as have found triumph and favours, Never daunted at any time: but now a Shepherd, Admired in Court for worthiness, And Segastoes honour laid aside: My will therefore is this, that thou dost finde some means to work the Shepherds death: I know thy strength sufficient to perform my desire, and to love no otherwise then to revenge my injuries. Tre. It is not the frowns of a Shepherd that Tremelio fears: Therefore account it accomplish'd what I take in hand. Segast. Thanks good Tremelio, and assure thy self, What I promise, that I will perform. Tre. Thanks good my Lord: And in good time: See where he cometh; stand by awhile, And you shall see me put in practise your intended drift. Have at thee Swain, if that I hit thee right. Enter Mucedorus. Muce. Vild Coward, so without cause to strike a man: Turn Coward, turn: now strike and do thy worst. Mucedorus killeth him. Segast. Hold Shepherd, hold, spare him, kill him not: Accursed villain, tell me, what hast thou done? Ah Tremelio, Trusty Tremelio, I sorrow for thy death, And since that thou living didst prove faithful to Segasto, So Segasto now living will honour the dead Corps of Tremelio with revenge. Blood-thirsty villain, born and bred in merciless murder, Tell me, how durst thou be so bold, As once to lay thy hands upon the least of mine? Assure thy self, thou shalt be us'd according to the Law. Muce. Segasto cease, these threats are needless, Accuse me not of murder, that have done nothing But in mine own defence. Segast. Nay Shepherd, reason not with me, Ile manifest thy fact unto the King; Whose doom will be thy death, as thou deservest. What hoe: Mouse come away.
Enter Mouse. Clow. Why how now? what's the matter? I thought you would be calling before I had done. Segast. Come help away with my friend. Clow. Why, is he drunk? can he not stand on his feet? Segast. No, he is not drunk, he is slain. Clow. Flain? No by Lady, he is not flain. Segast. He is kill'd I tell thee. Clow. What do yo use to kill your friends? I will serve you no longer. Segast. I tell thee the Shepherd killed him. Clow. O did he so? But Master, I will have all his apparell if I carry him away. Segast. Why so thou shalt. Clow. Come then I will help: Mass Master I think his mo∣ther sung looby to him, he is so heavy. Exeunt. Muce. Behold the fickle state of man, always mutable, ne∣ver at one. Sometime we feed our fancies with the sweet of our desires: Sometimes again, we feel the heat of extream miseries. Now am I in favour about the Court and Country, To morrow those favours will turn to frowns. To day I live revenged on my foe, To morrow I die, my foe revenged on me. Exit. Enter Bremo a wild man. Bremo. No passenger this morning? what not one? A chance that seldom doth befall, What, not one? Then lie thou there, And rest thy self til I have further need: Now Bremo sith thy leasure so affords, An endless thing, who knows not Bremoes strength, Who like a King commands within these woods? The Bear, the Boar dare not abide his sight, But haste away to save themselvess by flight. The Chrystal waters in the bubling brooks, When I come by do swiftly slide away, And claps themselves in closets under banks, Afraid to look bold Bremo in the face. The aged Oaks at Bremoes breath do bow, And all things else are still at my command.
Else what would I? Rend them in pieces, and pluck them from the earth, And each way else I would revenge myself. Why, who comes here? with whom dare I not fight? Who fights with me and doth not die the death? Not one. What favour shews this sturdy stick to those That here within these woods are combatants with me? Why, death, and nothing else but present death. With restless rage I wander through these woods, No creature here, but feareth Bremoes force: Man, woman, child, beast, and bird, And every thing that doth approach my sight, Are forst to fall, if Bremo once do frown. Come, Cudgel come, my partner in my spoils: For here I see this day it will not be, But when it falls that I encounter any, One pat sufficeth for to work my will. What, comes not one? then lets be gone, A time will serve when we shall better speed. Exit. Enter the King, Segasto, the Shepherd, & the Clown, with others. King. Shepherd, thou staft heard thine accusers, Murther is laid to thy charge: What canst thou say? thou hast deserved death. Muce. Dread Soveraign, I must needs confess, I slew this Captain in my own defence, Not of any malice, but by chance: But mine accuser hath a further meaning. Segast. Words will not here prevail. I seek for justice, and justice craves his death. King. Shepherd, thine own confession hath condemned thee; Sirrah, take him away, and do him to execution straight. Clo. So he shall, I warrant him: But do you hear Master King? he is kin to a Monky, His neck is bigger then his head. Seg. Come sirrah, away with him, And hang him about the middle. Clo. Yes forsooth, I warrant you, come you sirrah: A, so like a sheep-biter a looks.
Enter Amadine, and a Boy with a Bears head. Ama. Dread Soveraign, and wel beloved sir, On bended knee I crave the life of this condemned Shepherd, which heretofore preserved the life of thy sometime distressed daughter. King. Preserved the life of my sometime distressed daughter! How can that be? I never knew the time Wherein was thou distrest: I never knew the day But that I have maintained thy estate, As best beseem'd the daughter of a King. I never saw the Shepherd until now. How comes it then that he preserv'd thy life? Ama. Once walking with Segasto in the woods, Further then our accustomed manner was, Right before us down a steep fall hill, A monstrous ugly Bear did hie him fast To meet us both: now whether this be true, I refer it to the credit of Segasto. Seg. Most true an't like your Majesty. King. How then? Ama. The Bear being eager to obtain his prey, Made forward to us with an open mouth, As if he meant to swallow us both at once: The sight whereof did make us both to dread; But specially your daughter Amadine, Who, for I saw no succour incident But in Segastoes valour, I grew desperate: And he most coward-like began to fly. Left me distrest to be devour'd of him, How say you Segasto, is it not true? King. His silence verifies it to be true: what then? Ama. Then I amaz'd, distressed all alone, Did hie me fast, to scape that ugly Bear, But all in vain; for why he reached after me, And hardly I did oft escape his paws. Till at the length this Shepherd came, And brought to me his head. Come hither boy, lo here it is, which I do present unto your Majesty. King. The slaughter of this Bear deserves great fame.
Segast. The slaughter of a man deserves great blame. King. Indeed occasion oftentimes so falls out. Segast. Tremelio in the wars (O King) preserved thee. Ama. the Shepherd in the woods (O King) preserved me. Segast. Tremelio fought when many men did yield. Ama. So would the Shepherd had he been in field. Clow. So would my master, had he not run away. Segast. Tremelio's force sav'd thousands from the foe, Ama. The Shepherds force hath many thousand moe. Clow. Aye Shipsticks nothing else. King. Segasto cease to accuse the Shepherd, His worthiness deserves a recompence; All we are bound to do the Shepherd good. Shepherd, whereas it was my sentence thou shouldst die, So shall my sentence stand, for thou shalt die. Segast. Thanks to your Magestie. King. But soft Segasto, not for this offence▪ Long maist thou live; and when the Sisters shall decree, To cut in twain the twisted thred of life, Then let him die, for this I set him free, And for thy valour I will honour thee. Ama. Thanks to your Majestie. King. Come daughter, let us now depart to honour the wor∣thy valour of the Shepherd, with our rewards. Exeunt. Clow. O Master, hear you, you have made a fresh hand now, I thought you would beshrow you: what will you do now? You have lost me a good occupation by this means: Faith Master now I cannot hang the shepherd, I pray you let me take pains to hang you, It is but half an hours exercise. Segast. You are still in your knavery, But sith I cannot have his life, I will procure his banishment for ever: Come on sirrah. Clow. Yes forsooth I come. Laugh at him I pray you. Exeunt. Enter Mucedorus solus. Muce. From Amadine, and from her Fathers Court, With gold and silver and with rich rewards, Flowing from the banks of gold and treasures:
More may I boast and say: but I Was never Shepherd in such dignitie. Enter the Messenger and the Clown. Mes. All hail worthy Shepherd. Clo. All rain lousie Shepherd. Muce. Welcome my friends, from whence come you? Mes. The King and Amadine greet thee well, And after greeting done, bids thee depart the Court; Shepherd be gone. Clow. Shepherd take Law-legs: fly away Shepherd. Muce. Whose words are these? came these from Amadine? Mes. I, from Amadine. Clow. Aye from Amadine. Muce. Ah luckless fortune, worse then Phaetons tale, My former bliss is now become my bale. Clow. What, wilt thou poyson thy self? Muce. My former heaven is now become my hell. Clo. The worst Ale-house that ever I came in, in all my life. Muce. What shall I do? Clow. Even go hang thy self. Muce. Can Amadine so churlishly command, To bannish the Shepherd from her fathers Court? Mes. What should Shepherds do in the Court? Clow. What should Shepherds do among us; Have not we Lords enough on us in the Court? Muce. Why, Shepherds are men, and Kings are no more. Mes. Shepherds are men, and masters over their flocks. Clow. That's a lie, who payes them their wages then? Mes. Well, you are alwayes interrupting of me: But you were best to look to him, lest you hang for him when he is gone. Exit. The Clown sings. Clow. And you shall hang for company, For leaving me alone. Shepherd stand forth and hear my sentence. Shepherd be gone within three days, in pain of my displeasure, Shepherd be gone, Shepherd be gone, be gone, be gone, be gone. Shepheard, Shepherd, Shepherd. Muce. And must I go? and must I needs depart?
Ye goodly Groves, partakers of my songs, In time before when fortune did not frown, Pour forth your plaints, and wail awhile with me; And thou bright Sun, the comfort of my cold, Hide, hide thy face and leave me comfortless; Ye wholsome herbs and sweet smelling savours; Yea each thing else prolonging life of man, Change, change your wonted course, That I wanting your aid, in wofull sort may die. Enter Amadine and Ariena her maid. Ama. Ariena, if any body ask for me, Make some excuse till I return. Ari. What and Segasto call? Ama. Do you the like to him, I mean not to stay long. Exit. Muce. This voice so sweet my pining spirit revives. Ama. Shepherd well me, tell me how thou dost. Muc. I linger life, yet wish for speedy death. Ama. Shepherd, although thy banishment already he de∣creed, and all against my will, yet Amadine— Muce. Ah Amadine, to hear of banishment is death: I double death to me: but since I must depart, one thing I crave. Ama. Say on with all my heart. Muce. That in absence either far or near, You honour me as servant to your name. Ama. Not so. Muc. And why? Ama. I honour thee at Soveraign of my heart. Muc. A Shpeherd and a Soveraign, nothing like. Ama. Yet like enough where there is no dislike, Muce. Yet great dislike, or else no banishment. Ama. Shepherd it is only Segasto that procures thy banish∣ment. Muce. Unworthy wights are more in jealousie. Ama. Would God they would free thee from banishment, Or likewise banish me. Muce. Amen I say, to have your company. Ama. Well Shepherd, sith thou sufferest thus for my sake, VVith thee in exile also let me live, On this condition Shepherd thou canst love. Muce. No longer love, no longer let me live.
Am. Of late I loved one indeed, but now I love none but on∣ly thee, Mu. Thanks worthy Princess: I burn likewise, Yet smother up the blast: I dare not promise what I may perform. Ama. Well Shepherd, hark what I shall say, I vvill return unto my fathers Court, There for to provide me of much necessaries As for my journey I shall think most fit. This being done, I will return to thee; Do thou therefore appoint the place Where we may meet▪ Muce. Down in the valley where I slew the Bear, And there doth grow a fair broad branched beech That overshades a well, so who comes first, Let them abide the happy meeting of it both. How like you this? Ama. I like in well. Muce Now if you please, you may appoint the time. Ama. Full three hours hence, God willing I will return. Muce. The thanks that Paris gave the Grecian Queen, The like doth Mucedorus yield. Ama. Then Mucedorus for three hours farewell. Exit, Muce Your departure Lady breeds a privy pain. Exit. Enter Segastus solus. Segast. 'Tis well Segasto, that thou hast thy will▪ Should such a Shepherd, such a simple Swain as he, Eclipse thy credit famous thorow the Court? No, ply Segasto, ply, let it not in Aragon be said, A Shepherd hath Segastoes honour won. Enter Mouse the Clown, calling his Master. Clow. What, hoe Master, will you come away? Segast. Will you come hither, I pray you, what is the matter? Clow▪ Why, is it not past eleven of the clock? Seg. How then sir? Clow. I pray you come away to dinner. Seg. I pray you come hither. Clow. Here's such a do with you, will you never come? Seg. I pray you sir, what news of the message I sent you about? Clow. I tell you all the Messes be on the Table already.
There wants not so much as a mess of Mustard, half an hour ago. Seg. Come sir, your mind is all upon your belly, You have forgotten what I bid you do. Clo. Faith, I know nothing but you bad me go to breakfast. Seg. Was that all? Clo. Faith I have forgotten it, the very scent of the meat hath made me forget it quite. Seg. You have forgotten the Arrand I bid you do. Clo. What Arrand, an arrant knave, or an arrant whore? Seg. Why thou knave, did I not bid thee banish the Shepherd. Clo. O the Shepherds Bastard. Seg. I tell thee the Shepherds Banishment. Col. I tell you the Shepherds Bastard shall be well kept, Ile look to it my self: but I pray you come away to dinner. Seg. Then you will not tell me whether you have banished him or no? Clo. Why I cannot say banishment if you would give me a thousand pounds to say so. Seg. Why you whorsen slave, have you forgotten that I sent you and another to drive away the Shepherd? Clo. What an Ass are you? here's a stir indeed: Her's Message, Arrant, Banishment, and I cannot tell what. Seg. I pray you sir, shall I know whether you have drove him away? Clo. Faith I think I have, and you will not believe me, ask my staff. Seg. Why can thy staff tell? Clo. Why he was with me too. Seg. Then happy I, that have obtain'd my will. Clo. And happier I if you would go to dinner. Seg. Come sirrah, follow me. Clo. I warrant you I will not lose an inch of you now you are going to dinner: I promise you I thought seven years be∣fore I could get him away. Enter Amadine sola. Ama. God grant my long delay procures no harm For this my tarrying frustrate my pretence: My Mucedorus surely stays for me,
And thinks me over-long, at length I come, My present promise to perform; Ah what a thing is firm unfained love! What is it which true love dares not attempt? My father he may make, but I must match: Segasto loves, but Amadine must like Where likes her best: compulsion is a thrall? No, no, the hearty choice is all in all. The Shepherds vertue Amadine esteems. But what, methinks the Shepherd is not come; I muse at that, the hour is at hand. Well here Ile rest till Mucedorus come. She sits down. Enter Bremo, looking about hastily, takes hold on her. Bre. A happy prey; now Bremo feed on flesh: Dainties Bremo, dainties thy hungry paunch to fill; Now glut thy greedy guts with lukewarm blood: Come fight with me, I long to see thee dead. Ama. How can she fight that weapons cannot wield? Bre. What canst not fight? then lie thee down and die. Ama. What must I die? Bre. What needs these words? I thirst to suck thy blood. Ama. Yet pitty me, and let me live awhile. Bre. No pitty I, Ile feed upon thy flesh, And tear thy body peece-meal joynt by joynt. Am. Ah now I want my Shepherds company. Bre. Ile crush thy bones between two Oaken trees. Am. Hast Shepherd, hast, or else thou com'st too late. Bre. Ile suck the sweetness from thy marrow-bones. Ama. Ah spare, ah spare to shed my guiltless blood. Bre. With this my Bat I will beat out thy brains; Down, down I say, postrate thy self upon the ground. Ama. Then Mucedorus farewell, my hoped joys farewell; Yea farewell life, and welcome present death. She kneels. To thee, O God, I yield my dying ghost. Bre. Now Bremo, play thy part. How now? what sudden chance is this? My limbs do tremble, and my sinews shake,
My unweakned Arms have lost their former force: Ah Bremo, Bremo, what a foil hadst thou, That yet at no time was afraid, To dare the greatest Gods to fight with thee, He strikes. And now wants strength for one down driving blow? Ah how my courage fails when I should strike! Some new-come spirit abiding in my brest, Saith, spare her Bremo, spare her, do not kill: Shall I spare her that never spared any? To it Bremo, to it; say again: I cannot wield my weapon in my hand, Me thinks I should not strike so fair a one: I think her beauty hath bewitcht my force, Or else with me altred natures course. Ay woman, wilt thou live in woods with me? Ama. Fain would I live, yet loth to live in woods. Br. Thou shalt not choose, it shall be as I say, And therefore follow me. Exeunt. Enter Mucedorus solus. Muce. It was my will an hour ago and more, As was my promise for to make return; But other business hindred my pretence. It is a world to see, when men appoints, And purposely on certain things decrees, How many things may hinder his intent: What one would wish, the same is farthest off, But yet th' appointed time cannot be past, Nor hath her presence yet prevented me: Well here Ile stay, and expect her coming. They cry within, hold him, hold him. Some one or other is pursu'd no doubt. Perhaps some search for me, tis good to doubt the worst: Therefore Ile be gone. Exit. Cry within, hold him, hold him. Enter Mouse the Clown, with a Pot. Clo. Hold him, hold him, hold him: here's, a stir indeed; here came hu after the Crier; & I was set close at mother Nips house,
and there I called for three pots of Ale, as tis the manner of us Courtiers; Now sirrah, I had taken the maidenhead of two of them, and as I was lifting up the third to my mouth, there came, hold him, hold him: now I could not tell whom to catch hold on, but I am sure I caught one, perchance a may be in this pot; Well Ile see, mass I cannot see him yet; well Ile look a little further; mass he is a little slave if he be here: why heres no body; all this is well yet. But if the old Trot should come for her pot, I marry theres the matter: but I care not, Ile face her out, and call her old rusty, dusty, musty, fusty, crusty Firebrand, and worse then all that, and so face her out of her pot: but soft, here she comes. Enter the old woman. Old. Come you knave; wheres my pot you knave? Clo. Go look your pot, come not to me for your pot, twere good for you. Old. Thou liest thou knave, thou hast my pot. Clo. You ly and you say it, I your pot? Ile know what Ile say. Old. What wilt thou say? Clo. But say I have it and thou darest. Old. Why thou knave, thou hast not only my pot, but my drink unpaid for. Clo. You ly like an old▪ I will not say whore. Old. Dost thou call me whore? Ile cap thee for my pot. Clo. Cap me and thou darest; Search me whether I have it or no. She searcheth him, and he drinketh over her head, and casteth down the pot, she stumbleth at it: and then they fall together by the ears: she takes up her pot and runs out. Enter Segasto. Seg. How now sirrah, whats the matter? Clo. O flies Master, flies. Seg. Flies, where are they? Clo. O here Master, all about your face. Seg. Why thou liest, I think thou act mad. Clo. Why master I have kild a dungcart full at the least. Seg. Go to sirrah, leave this idle talk, give ear to me Clo. How, give you one of my ears▪
Not an you were ten masters. Seg. Why sir, I pray you give ear to my words. Clo. I tell you I will not be made a Curtal for no mans plea∣sure. Seg. I tell thee attend what I say, Go thy ways straight and rear the whole town. Clo. How, rear the whole town? even go your self, it is more than I can do: VVhy, do you think I can rear a town, that can scarce rear a pot of Ale to my head, I should rear a town, should I not? Seg. Go to the Constable and make a privie search, For the Shepherd is run away with the Kings daughter. Clo. How? is the Shepherd run away with the Kings daugh∣ter, or is the Kings daughter run away with the Shepherd? Seg. I cannot tell, but they are both gone together. Clo. VVhat a fool is she to run away with the Shepherd; why I think I am a little handsomer man then the Shepherd my self; but tell me Master, must I make a privie search, or search in the privie? Seg. Why doest thou think they will be there? Clo. I Cannot tell. Seg. Well then search every where, Leave no place unsearcht for them. Clo. Oh now I am in office: now will I to that old Firebrands house, and will not leave one place unsearched: Nay, Ile to the Ale-stand, and drink so long as I can stand; and when I have done, Ile let out all the rest, to see if he be not hid in the Barel; and if I find him not there, Ile to the Cupbord, Ile not leave one corner of her house unsearcht, ifaith ye old Crust, Ile be with you now. Exit. Sound Musicke. Enter thee King of Valentia, Anselmo, Roderigo, Lord Barachius, with others. King Va. Enough of musick, it but adds to torment, Delights to vexed Spirits are as dates Set to a sick man, which rather cloy then comfort: Let me intreat you to intreat no more. Musick ceaseth. Rod. Let your strings sleep, have done there: King Va. Mirth to a soul disturb'd, are Embers turn'd,
Which suddain gleam with molestation, But sooner lose their sight for't, Tis gold bestow'd upon a Rioter, Which not relieves but murthers him. Tis a drugg given to the healthful, Which infects, not cures. How can a Father that hath lost his Son, A Prince both wise, vertuous, and valiant, Take pleasure in the idle acts of Time? No, no, till Mucedorus I shall see again, All joy is comfortless, all pleasure pain. Ans. Your Son (my Lord) is well. King. Va. I prethee speak that thrice. Ansel. The Prince your Son is safe. King. Va. O where Anselmo? surfet me with that. Ans. In Aragon, my Liege, and at his parting, Bound my secrecie, By his affections love not to disclose it: But care of him, and pitty of your age Makes my tongue blab what my brest vow'd, concealment. Kinng Va. Thou not decievest me, I ever thought thee what I finde thee now, An upright loyal man. But what desire, or young-fed humor Nurst within his brain, Drew him so privatelie to Aragon? Ans. A forcing Adamant, Love mixt with fear and doubtful jealousie, Whether report gilded a worthless Trunk, Or Amadine deserved her high extolment. King Va. See our provision be in readiness, Collect us followers of the comliest hue For our chief guardians, we will thither wend; The Christal eye of Heaven shall not thrice wink, Nor the green Flood six times his shoulders turn, Till vve salute the Aragonian King. Musick speak loudly novv, the season's apt, For former dolours are in pleasures wrapt. Exeunt.
Enter Mucedorus to disguise himself. Mu. Now Mucedorus, whither wilt thou go? Home to thy father to thy native soil, Or trie some long abode within these woods? Well I will hence depart and hie me home, What hie me home said I? that may not be: In Amadine rests my felicitie. Then Mucedorus do as thou didst decree, Attire thee Hermite-like within these Groves: Walk often to the Beech, and view the Well, Make settles there, and seat thy self thereon: And when thou feel'st thy self to be a thirst, Then drink a hearty draught to Amadine, No doubt she thinks on thee, And will one day come pledge thee at this Well. Come habit, thou art fit for me: He disguiseth himself. No Shepherd now, an Hermite must I be: Methinks this fits me very well; Now must I learn to bear a walking staff, And exercise some gravity withall. Enter the Clown. Clo. Heres through the woods, and through the woods, To look out a Shepherd, and a stray Kings daughter: But soft, who have we here? what art thou? Mu. I am an Hermite. Clo. An Emmet, I never saw such a big Emmet in all my life before. Mu. I tell you sir, I am an Hermite, One that leads a solitary life within these woods. Clo. O I know thee now; thou art he that eats up all the Hips and Haws: we could not have one piece of fat Bacon for thee all this year. Mu. Thou dost mistake me: But I pray thee tell me, whom dost thou seek in these woods? Clo. What do I seek? for a stray Kings daughter, Run away with a Shepherd. Mu. A stray Kings daughter, run away with a Shepherd, Wherefore, canst thou tell?
Clo. Yes that I can, 'tis this; my Master and Amadine walk∣ing one day abroad, neerer these woods then they were used (about what I cannot tell) but towards them comes running a great Bear. Now my Master plad the man, and ran away, and Amadine crying after him: now sir, come, me a Shepherd, and he strikes off the Bears head, now whether the Bear were dead before or no I cannot tell, for bring twenty Bears before me, and binde their hands and feet, and Ile kill them all: now ever since Amadine hath been in love with the Shepherd, and for good will she is even run away with the Shepherd. Mu. What maner of man was he? canst describe him to me? Clo. Scribe him, ay I warrant you that I can; a was a little, low, broad, tall, narrow, big, well favoured fellow, a jerkin of white cloth, and buttons of the same cloth. Muc. Thou describest him well, but if I chance to see any such, pray you where shall I finde you, or whats your name? Clo. My name is called Master Mouse. Muc. O Master Mouse, I pray you what office might you bear in the Court? Clo. Marry sir, I am Rusher of the Stable. Muc. Oh, Usher of the Table. Clo. Nay, I say Rusher, and Ile prove mine Office good: for look you sir, when any comes from under the Sea, or so, and a dog chance to blow his nose backward, then with a whip I give him the good time of the day, and strow Rushes present∣ly, therefore I am a Rusher: a high Office I promise ye. Muc. But where shall I finde you in the Court? Clo. Why, where it is best being, either in the Kitchin eat∣ing, or in the Butterie drinking: but if you come, I will pro∣vide for thee a piece of Beef and Brewes knuckle deep in fat: pray you take pains, remember Master Mouse. Exit. Muc. Ay sir, I warrant I will not forget you. Ah Amadine, what should become of her? Whither shouldst thou go so long unknown? With watch and ward each passage is beset, So that she cannot long escape unknown. Doubtless, she hath lost her self within these woods, And wandering to and fro, she seeks the Well,
Which yet she cannot find, therefore will I seek her out. Exit. Enter Bremo and Amadine. Bre. Amadine, how like you Bremo and his woods? Ama. As like the woods of Bremoes crueltie: Though I were dumb and could not answer him, The beasts themselves would with relenting tears Bewail thy savage and inhumane deeds. Bre. My love why dost thou murmur to thy self? Speak louder, for thy Bremo hears thee not. Ama. My Bremo, no, the Shepherd is my Love. Bre. Have I not sav'd thee from sudden death. Given thee leave to live that thou mightest love, And dost thou whet me on to crueltie? Come kiss me (sweet) for all my favours past. Ama. I may not Bremo, therefore pardon me. Bre. See how she flies away from me, I will follow and give attend to her. Denie my Love? A worm of Beautie, I will chastise thee: come, come, Prepare thy head upon the block. Ama. O spare me Bremo, love should limit life. Not to be made a murtherer of himself. If thou wilt glut thy loving heart with blood, Encounter with the Lion or the Bear, And like a Wolf, prey not upon a Lamb. Bre. Why then dost thou repine at me? If thou wilt love me, thou shalt be my Queen, Ile crown thee with a chaplet made of Ivory, And make the Rose and Lilly wait on thee: Ile rend the burley branches from the Oak, To shadow thee from burning Sun. The Trees shall spread themselves where thou dost go, And as they spread, Ile trace along with thee. Ama. You may, for who bu you? Bre. Thou shalt berfed with Qails and Partridges, With Black-birds, Larks, Thrushes, and Nightingales. Thy drink shall be goats-milk, and Chrystal water, Distilling from the Fountains and the clearest Springs:
And all the dainties that the woods afford, Ile freely give thee to obtain thy love. Ama. You may, for who but you? Bre. The day Ile spend to recreate my love, With all the pleasures that I can devise: And in the night Ile be thy bedfellow, And lovingly embrace thee in my arms. Ama. One may, so may not you. Bre. The Satyrs and the wood-Nymphs shall attend on thee, And lull thee asleep with musick sound, And in the morning when thou dost awake, The Lark shall sing good morrow to my Queen, And whilst he sings Ile kiss mine Amadine. Ama. You may, for who but you? Bre. When thou art up, the wood-lanes shall be strewed With violets, Cowslips, and sweet Marigolds, For thee to trample and to tread upon: And I will teach thee how to kill the Dear, To chase the Hart, and how to rouze the Roe, If thou wilt live to love and honour me. Ama. You may for who but you? Enter Mucedorus. Bremo. Welcome sir, an hour ago I lookt for such a guest, Be merry wench, weel have a frolick feast, Here's flesh enough for to suffice us both, Say sirrah, wilt thou fight, or dost thou mean to die? Muce. I want a weapon▪ how can I fight? Bre. Thou want'st a weapon, why then thou yieldst to die? Muce. I say not so, I do not yield to die. Bre. Thou shalt not chuse, I long to see thee dead. Ama. Yet spare him Bremo, spare him. Bre. Away, I say I will not spare him. Muce. Yet give me leave to speak. Bre. Thou shalt not speak. Ama. Yet give him leave to speak for my sake. Bre. Speak on, but be not over-long. Muce. In time of yore, when men-like bruitish beasts Did lead their lives in loathsome Cells and Woods,
And wholy gave themselves to witless will: A rude unruly rout, then man to man became A present prey; then might prevailed, The weakest went to wals; Right was unknown, for wrong was all in all. As men thus lived in their great outrage, Behold one Orpheus came (as Poets tell) And them from rudeness unto reason brought, Who led by reason soon forsook the woods, In stead of Caves they built them Castles strong, Cities and Towns were founded by them then: Glad were they, they found such ease, And in the end they grew to perfect Amitie. Weighing their former wickedness, They tearm'd the time wherein they lived then, A golden age, a good golden age. New Bremo (for so heard I thee call'd) If men which lived tofore as thou dost now, Wild in woods, addicted all to spoil, Returned were by worthy Orpheus means: Let me (like Orpheus) cause thee to return From murther, blood-shed, and like cruelties. What should we fight before we have a cause? No, lets live and love together faithfully: Ile fight for thee. Bre. Fight for me, or die: or fight or else thou diest. Ama. Hold Bremo, hold. Bre. Away I say, thou troublest me. Ama. You promised me to make me Queen. Bre. I did, I mean no less. Ama. You promised that I should have my will. Bre. I did, I mean no less. Ama. Then save the Hermites life, for he may save us both. Bre. At thy request Ile save him, but never any after him Say Hermite, what canst thou do? Muce. Ile wait on thee, sometime upon thy Queen, Such service shalt thou shortly have as Bremo never had. Exeunt.
Enter Segasto, the Clown, and Rumbelo. Segast. Come sirs, what shall I never have you find out A∣madine and the Shepherd? Clow. I have been thorow the woods, and thorow the woods, and could see nothing but an Emmet. Rum. Why I see a thousand Emmets, thou meanest a little one. Clow. Nay, that Emmet that I saw was bigger then thou art. Rum. Bigger then I? what a fool have you to your man? I pray you Master turn him away. Segast. But dost thou hear, was he not a man? Clow. I think he was, for he said he did lead a salt-sellers life round about the woods. Seg. Thou wouldst say a solitarie life about the wood. Clow. I think it was indeed. Rum. I thought what a fool thou art. Clow. Thou art a wise man: why he did nothing but sleep since he went. Seg. But tell me Mouse, how did he go? Clo. In a white Gown, and a white hat on his head, And a staff in his hand. Seg. I thought so, he was an Hermite, that walked a solitarie life in the woods. Well, get you to dinner, and after, never leave seeking till you bring some news of them, or Ile hang you both. Exit. Clow. How now Rumbelo, what shall we do now? Rum. Faith Ile whom to dinner, and afterwards to sleep. Clow▪ Why then thou wilt be hanged. Rum. Faith I care not, for I know I shall never find them: Well, Ile once more abroad; and if I cannot find them, Ile never come home again. Clow. I tell thee what Rumbelo, thou shalt go in at one end of the wood, and I at the other, and we will both meet together in the midst. Rum. Content, lets away to dinner. Exeunt. Enter Mucedorus solus. Muce. Unknown to any, here within these woods, With bloody Bremo do I lead my life; The Monster he doth murder all he meets,
He spareth none, and none doth him escape: Who would continue, who but onely I, In such a cruel cut-throats company? Yet Amadine is there, how can I chuse? Ah silly soul, how oftentimes she sits, And sighs, and calls, Come Shepherd, come: Sweet Mucedorus come set me free, When Mucedorus (Peasant) stands her by; But here she comes: What news fair Lady, As you walk these woods? Enter Amadine. Ama. Ah Hermite, none but bad, And such as thou knowest. Muce. How do you like your Bremo and his woods? Ama. Not my Bremo, nor his Bremo woods. Muce. And why not yours? methinks he loves you well. Ama. I like not him, his love to me is nothing worth. Muce. Lady, in this methinks you offer wrong, To hate the man that ever loves you best. Ama. Ah Hermite, I take no pleasure in his love, Neither doth Bremo like me best. Muce. Pardon my boldness, fair Lady, sith we both May safely talk now out of Bremoes sight, Unfold to me, if you please, the full discourse, How, when, and why you came into these woods, And fell into this bloody butchers hands. Ama. Hermite I wil: Of late a worthy Shepherd I did love. Muce. A Shepherd (Lady) sure a man unfit to match with you. Ama. Hermite, this is true: and when we had— Muce. Stay there, the wild man comes, Refer the rest until another time. Enter Bremo. Bre. What secret tale is this? what whispering have we here? Villain, I charge thee tell thy tale again. Muce. If needs I must, lo here it is again. When as we both had lost the sight of thee, It griev'd us both, but specially thy Queen, Who in thy absence evers fears the worst, Lest some mischance befall your Royal Grace.
Shall my sweet Bremo wander through the wood, Toil to and fro, for to redress my want, Hazard his life, and all to cherish me? I like not this quoth she: And thereupon crave to know of me, If I could teach her handle weapons well. My answer was, I had small skill therein: But gladsome (mighty King) to learn of thee: And this was all. Bre. Wast so? none can mislike of this: Ile teach you both to fight, but first my Queen begin, Here take this weapon, see how thou canst use it. Ama. This is too big, I cannot wield it in mine arm. Bre. Is't so? wee'l have a knotty Crab-tree staff for thee; But sirrah, tell me, what saiest? Muce. With all my heart I willing am to learn. Bre. Then take my staff and see how thou canst wield it. Muce. First teach me to how hold it in mine hand. Bre. Thou holdest it well; look how he doth, Thou mayest the sooner learn. Muce. Next tell how, and when 'tis best to strike. Bre. 'Tis best to strike when time doth serve, Tis best to lose no time. Muce. Then now or never it is time to strike. Bre. And when thou strikest, be sure to hit the head. Muce. The head? Bre. The very head. Muce. Then have at thine. He strikes him down dead. So, lie there and die, a death (no doubt) according to desert, Or else a worse, as thou deservest worse. Ama. It glads my heart this Tyrants death to see. Muce. Now Lady it remains in you To end the tale you lately had begun, Being interrupted by this wicked wight: You said you loved a Shepherd. Ama. I, so I do, and none but onely him: And will do still as long as life shall last. Muce. But tell me Lady, sith I set you free,
What course of life do you intend to take? Ama. I will disguised wander thorow the world, Till I have found him out. Muce. How if you find your Shepherd in these woods? Ama. Ah! none so happy then as Amadine. He discloseth himself. Muce. In tract of time a man may alter much: Say Lady, do you know your Shepherd well? Ama. My Mucedorus, hath he set me free? Muce. He hath set thee free. Ama. And liv'd so long unknown to Amadine? Muce. Ay that's a question whereof you may not be re∣solved: You know that I am banisht from the Court, I know likewise each passage is beset, So that we cannot long escape unknown, Therefore my will is this, that we return, Right thorow the thickets to the wild mans Cave, And there a while live on his provision, Untill the search and narrow watch be past: This is my councel, and I like it best. Ama. I think the very same. Muce. Come let's be gone. The Clown searcheth, and fals over the wild man, and so caries him away. Clow. Nay soft sir, are you here? abot on you I was like to be hang'd for not finding of you: We would borrow a certain stray Kings daughter of you, A wench, a wench sir, we would have. Muce. A wench of me? Ile make thee eat my sword. Clow. O Lord, nay, and you are so lusty, Ile call a cooling-card for you: O Master, Master, come away quickly. Enter Segasto. Segast. What's the matter? Clow. Look, Amadine and the Shepherd▪ O brave. Seg. What minion, have I found you out? Clow. Nay that's a lye, I found her out my self. Seg. Thou gadding huswife, what cause hadst thou To gad abroad?
When as thou knowest our wedding day so nigh? Ama. Not so Segasto, no such thing in hand: Shew your assurance, then Ile answer you. Segast. Thy fathers promise my assurance is. Ama. But what he promis'd he hath not perform'd. Segast. It rests in thee for to perform the same. Ama. Not I. Segast. And why? Ama. So is my will, and therefore even no. Clow. Master with a none, none so. Segast. Ah wicked villain, art thou here? Muce. What need these words? weigh them not. Segast. We weigh them not, proud Shepherd I scorn thy company. Clow. Weel not have a corner of thy company. Muce. I scorn not thee, nor yet the least of thine. Clo. That's a lie, a would have kild me with his pugs-nando. Segast. This stoutness Amadine contents me not. Ama. Then seek another that may you better please. Muce. Well Amadine it only rests in thee, Without delay to make thy choise of three: There stands Segasto, a second here, There stands the third: now make thy choice. Clow. A Lord at the least I am. Ama. My choice is made, for I will none but thee. Segast. A worthy mate (no doubt) for such a wife. Muce. And Amadine, why wilt thou none but me? I cannot keep thee as thy father did; I have no Lands for to maintain thy state: Moreover, if thou mean to be my wife, Commonly this must be thy use, To bed at midnight, up at four, Drudge all day, and trudge from place to place, Whereby our daily victuall for to win; And last of all, which is the worst of all, No Princess then, but a plain Shepherds wife. Clow. Then God gee you good morrow goody Shepherd. Ama. It shall not need if Amadine do live, Thou shalt be crowned King of Aragon.
Clow. O Master laugh, when he is a King, Ile be a Queen. Muc. Then know that which neretofore was known: I am no Shepherd, no Aragonion I, But born of Royal blood: my Father's of Valentia King, My Mother Queen; who for thy sacred sake Took this hard task in hand. Ama. Ah how I joy my fortune is so good. Segast. Well now I see Segasto shall not speed, But Mucedorus, I as much do joy To see thee here within our Court of Aragon, As if a kingdom had befaln me this time: I with my heart surrender her to thee. He gives her to him. And look what Right to Amadine I have. Clow. What barns door, and born where my Father was Constable? a bots on thee, how dost thou? Muc. Thanks Segasto, but you leveld at the Crown. Clow. Master, bear this and bear all. Segast. Why so sirrah? Clow. He saies you take a goose by the Crown. Segast. Go too sirrah; away, post you to the King, Whose heart is fraught with careful doubts, Glad him up, and tell him these good news, And we will follow as fast as we may. Clow. I go Master, I run Master. Exeunt. Enter the King and Collin. King. Break heart, and end my pallid woes, My Amadine, the comfort of my life; How can I joy except she were in sight? Her absence breeds great sorrow to my soul, And with a thunder breaks my heart in twain. Collin. Forbear those passions gentle King, And you shall see twill turn unto the best, And bring your soul to quiet and to joy. King. Such joy as death, I do assure me that, And nought but death, except of her I hear, And that with speed, I cannot sigh thus long: But what a tumult do I hear within?
They cry within, Joy and happiness. Collin. I hear a noise of over-passing joy Within the Court: my Lord be of good comfort, And here comes one in hast. Enter the Clown running. Clow. A King, a King. Col. Why how now sirrah, what's the matter? Clow. O 'tis news for a King, tis worth mony. King. Why sirrah, thou shalt have silver and gold if it be good. Clow. O 'tis good, 'tis good Amadine. King. O what of her? tell me, and I will make thee a knight. Clow. How a Spright, no by Lady, I will not be a Spright. Master get you away, if I be a Spright, I shall be so lean I shall make you all afraid. Col. Then (Sot) the King means to make thee a Gentleman. Clow. Why I shall want parrell. King. Thou shalt want for nothing. Clow. Then stand away, strike up thy self, here they come. Enter Segasto, Mucedorus, and Amadine. Ama. My gracious Father, pardon thy disloyall daughter. King. What, do mine eyes behold my daughter Amadine? Rise up daughter, and let these embracing arms Shew some token of thy Fathers joy, Which ever since thy departure hath languished in sorrow. Ama. Dear Father, never were your sorrows Greater than my griefs: Never you so desolate as I comfortless: Yet nevertheless knowing my self To be the cause of both, on bended knees I humbly crave your pardon. King. Ile pardon thee (dear daughter) but as for him. Ama. Ay Father, what of him? King. As sure as I am King, and wear the Crown, Ile be reveng'd on that accursed wretch. Muc. Yet worthy Prince, work not thy will in wrath, shew favour. King. I, such favour as thou deservest. Muc. I do deserve the daughter of a King. King. Oh impudent! A Shepherd and so insolent.
Muc. No Shepherd I, but a worthy Prince. King. In fair conceit, not princely born. Muc. Yes Princely born, my Father is a King, My Mother a Queen, and of Valentia both. King. What Mucedorus, welcome to our Court, What cause hadst thou to come to me disguis'd? Muc. No cause to fear, I caused no offence; But this, desiring thy daughters vertues for to see, Disguis'd my self from out my Fathers Court, Unknown to any in secret I did rest, And passed many troubles near to death: So hath your daughter my partaker been. As you shall know hereafter more at large: Desiring you, you will give her to me, Even as mine own, and Soveraign of my life, Then shall I think my travels all well spent. King. With all my heart, but this, Segasto claims my promise made tofore, That he should have her as his only Wife, Before my Councel when he came from war. Segasto, may I crave thee let it pass, And give Amadine as Wife to Mucedorus? Segast. With all my heart, were it a far greater thing, And what I may to furnish up their rites, With pleasing sports and pastimes you shall see. King. Thanks good Segasto, I will think of this. Muc. Thanks good my Lord, and whilst I live, Account of me in what I can or may. Ama. Good Segasto, these great courtesies Shall not be forgot. Clow. Why hark you Master, bones what have you done? What, given away the wench you made me take such pains for? You are wise indeed. Mass and I had known of that, I would have had her my self: faith Master now we may go to breakfast with a wood-cock-pie. Segast. Go too sirrah▪ you were best to leave this knaverie. King. Come on my Lords, lets now to Court, Where we may finish up the joyfullest day
That ever hapt to a distressed King: Were but thy Father the Valentia Lord, Present in view of this combined knot. A shout within: Enter Messenger. What shout was that? Mes. My Lord the great Ʋalentia King, Newly arriv'd, intreats your presence. Muc. My Father? King Ara. Prepared welcoms give him entertainment; A happier Planet never raign'd then that Which governs at this hour. Sound. Enter the King of Valentia, Anselmo, Roderigo, Brachius, with others: The King runs and embraceth his Son. King Val. Rise honour of my age, food to my rest: Condemn not (mighty King of Aragon) My rude behaviour, so compell'd by nature, That manners stood unknowledged. King Ara. What we have to recite would tedious prove By declaration, therefore in and feast, To morrow the performance shall explain What words conceal: till then Drums speak, Bells ring▪ Give plausive welcoms to our brother King. Sound Drums and Trumpets. Exeunt omnes. Enter Comedy and Envy. Com. How now Envy; what blushest thou already? Peep forth, hide not thy head with shame, But with courage praise a womans deeds; Thy threats were vain, thou could'st do me no hurt, Although thou seemd'st to cross me with despight, I overwhelm'd and turn'd upside down thy blocks, And made thy self to stumble at the same. Envy. Though stumbled, yet not over-thrown, Thou canst not draw my head to mildness: Yet must I needs confess thou hast done well, And plaid thy part with mirth and pleasant glee: Say all this; yet canst thou not conquer me, Although this time thou hast got, Yet not the conquest neither.
A double revenge another time Ile have. Com. Envy spit thy gall; Plot, work, contrive, create new fallacies, Teem from thy womb each minute a black Traitor, Whose blood and thoughts have twins conception: Study to act deeds yet unchronicled, Cast native monsters in the moulds of men; Case vicious devils under sancted robes; Vnhasp the wicket where all perjuries roost, And swarm this ball with treasons, do thy worst, Thou canst not (hell-hound) cross my stear too night, Nor blinde that glory where I wish delight. Envy. I can, I will. Com. Nefarious Hag begin, And let us tugg till one the mastery win. Envy. Comedy, thou art a shallow Goose, Ile overthrow thee in thine own intent, And make thy fall my Comick merriment. Com. Thy policy wants gravity, thou art too weak; Speak friend, as how? Envy. Why thus, From my foul study will I hoist a wretch, A lean and hungry meager Canibal, whose jaws swell to his eyes with chewing malice; And him Ile make a Poet. Com. Whats that to the purpose? Envy. This scrambling Raven with his needy beard, Will I whet on to write a Comedy; Wherein shall be compos'd dark sentences, Pleasing to factious brains; And every otherwhere place me a Iest, Whose high abuse shall more torment then blows. Then I my self (quicker then lightning) Will flye me to the puissant Magistrate, And waiting with a trencher at his back, In midst of jollity rehearse those gauls (With some additions) so lately vented in your Theater; He on this cannot but make complaint
To our great danger, or at least restraint. Com. Ha, ha, ha, I laugh to hear thy folly: This is a trap for boys, not men, nor such, Especially deceitful in their doings, Whose staid discretion rules their purposes: I and my faction do eschew those vices: But see, O see, the weary Sun for rest, Hath lain his golden compass to the West, Where he perpetual bide, and ever shine, As Davids off-spring in his happy Clime. Stoop Envy, stoop, bow to the earth with me, Lets beg our pardon on our bended knee. They kneel. Envy. My power hath lost her might, Envies date's expired. And I amazed am. Fall down and quake. Com. Glorious and wise Arch-Caesar on this earth, At whose appearance Envie's strucken dumb, And all bad things cease operation: Vouchsafe to pardon our unwilling errour, So late presented to your gracious view, And weel endeavour with excess of pain, To please your senses in a choiser strain. Thus we commit you to the arms of night, Whose spangled carkass would for your delight, Strive to excell the day: be blessed then, Who other wishes, let him never speak. Envy. Amen. To Fame and Honour we commend your rest, Live still more happy, every hour more blest. FINIS.
