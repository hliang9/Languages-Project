LONDON, Feb. 25. Printed for R. Wood. 1643. 1642
A TRUE RELATION of a great overthrow given to the Ca∣valiers in Gloucestershire on Munday last by Sir WILLIAM WALLER, at a towne called Padsworth, how there were six score of the Cavaliers killed on the place, most of them being Gentlemen of quality, and chiefe Commanders in the Kings Army. With a true description of the manner of the fight, and what forces were on both sides, with many other remarkable Passages concerning the same. IT is not unknown to this Kingdome, that it hath pleased God in a wonderfull man∣ner to prosper the endeavours of a wor∣thy Member of the House of Commons (and a Commander under his Excellency the Earl of Essex) Sir William Waller, who when Co∣lonell Goring had possest himselfe of one of the
strongest Forts in this Kingdome, the town of Ports∣mouth, with all the Ordnance, Armes and Ammuni∣tion therein, the said Sir William Waller was the chie∣fest instrument under God to regain that Fort, and to force the said Colonell Goreing to yeeld up the town for the King and Parliament after he had betrayed the same, and had full possession thereof, and that without any losse on the Parliaments side, which towne hath ever since been preserved in peace and quiet, and is well fortified, and in a good posture of defence for the King and Parliament. After that it pleased God to make the said Sir WILLIAM WALLER the chiefe Agent in taking of Farnham Castle, which was also possessed by the Cavaliers, where he took a∣bout six score of them, and sent them up to London, and fortified it for the King and Parliament: and in this place since I have begun to speak of those great victories which he hath obtained, I should injure his person by concealing a great part of his me∣rits, if I should give a period to my discourse before I relate somthing of the businesse at Chichester in Sussex, and his late successe in the County of Gloucester: And in the first place, because it was formerly acted and first
mentioned, give me leave to speak a word or two of that great businesse of the taking of Chichester; for when the town was betray∣ed to the force and violence of the Cavaliers; and by the treachery of the high Sheriffe of that County, they had not onely the strength of the town, both of Armes, Ammunition and money, but had gotten a strong garrison into the same, and did either turn out of the town all the well-affected persons in the same, or kept them in such awe and subjecti∣on, that they durst not stir either on the one side, or other, the said Sir WILLIAM WAL∣LER being imployed by the Parliament up∣on that designe, with divers other worthy and deserving Gentlemen, and a considera∣ble number of horse and foot after a short time of siege laid against the said towne, he quickly forced his entrance, took many of the Gentlemen and Cavaliers which were in the towne prisoners, and sent them likewise up to LONDON, and thereby setled the peace of that City, which hath continued to this day. But because I have spoken of
great store of Prisoners which have been taken at too places before mentioned least there should be any misunderstanding in this particular it is not imperti∣nent to my present discourse to let the courteous Reader know that these prisoners are not all still in custody (though some of the chiefe of them are) for presently after they were brought up to London, the common souldiers were discharged, neither were they dragged along to London through the dirt, coupled together like doggs, as the prisoners which the Cavaliers took at Cicester in Gloucester-shire were, but they were brought to town in a faire way with∣out any hurt to the meanest of them, and within a day or two they were released, and money given to every one of them to carry him into his own Countrey, and during the time of their imprisonment they were not denied any thing that was fit and necessary for their present subsistance, every common Troper that upon any cause hath been committed to custody by the Parliament (though he were of the Kings Army) is allowed five pence per diem: it were to be wished that the like care were taken for those that were of the Parliaments side which have been taken perisoners and carryed to Oxford, where (as it is very credibly informed, being Captains and other officers) they are allowed but five farthings a day, and a prohibition that no other reliefe should be brought to them, or any friend visit them (which is not parctised at London) and sometimes they are one day or two without that petty allowance too. But to returne to my intended purpose, which is to
declare to the people (both for the glory of God and the greater honor of this noble gentleman) the good and happie successe of that valiant souldier, and worthy instrument of the common wealth and whole Kingdome, Sir William Waller, who hath great ex∣perience and knowledge in military affaires, and ac∣compainted with good successe, upon information of the Cavaliers being entred Gloucestershire, and tak∣ing the town of Cicester, he was designed to goe with some considerable forces into that County to relieve them against the oppression of that unwelcome Army which was gotten in upon them: And because of the present necessity that County was in and the great expectation they had of his comming thither he hast∣ed that expectation and march that way with a same lesse strength then otherwise he would have had with him, for 4. peeces of Ordinance which he should have carryed down into that County as it is informed, and many of the forces which were designed for that ser∣vice are as yet no further then Gilford or Farnham, yet it is reported and as a truth that the said Sir William Waller, being marched with some small force into Gloucestershire to a little town called Padsworth, having not one ful Regiment, was about Munday last assulted by the Kings forces, there being at least sixteen hun∣dred of them, which being discovered by Sir William Wallers scouts, he presently prepared for their com∣ing, and finding himself very much too weake for to encounter with the enemy upon an ordinary manner of fighting, he caused all his men to stand in battalia, and discharge upon the enemy at once, upon the word
given, which being done, at the first onset of the enemy there was about 80. of them slayn, which slaughter on a suddaine put them in such a fright, that they presently retreated back, and before they could be brought up again Sir Willirm Wallers men had charged the second time, and gave them the same en∣tertainment as they had before, killing 40. more of them, and forced them to another retreat, after which they sent for a parley, but the night approaching there could be no more done that day, and in the night the enemy fled to his owne Quarters (as they say neer un-Gloucester) and it is no doubt but in a short time that County will be settled in peace, notwithstanding the great distractions which are now amongst them by means of the Cavaliers. It is also informed that most of those forces which at this time came against the said Sir William, were gentlemen, and prime Commanders, and that they fled away as aforesaid, leaving their dead Corpes behind them, one whereof is reported to be a younger bro∣ther to the Duke of Lenox, his second brother the L. Aubery being killed at the battell in Keynton field. FINIS.
