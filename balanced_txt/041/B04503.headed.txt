THE Nobe Mans Generous Kindness, OR, The Country-Mans Unexpected Happiness. Giving a true Account of a Nobleman, who taking notice of the Poor Man's Industrious Care and pains for the maintaining of his Charge, which was seven small Children, meeting him upon a day, Discoursed with him, and inviting him and his Wife, with his Children, home to his House, and accordingly bestowâˆ£ed upon him a Farm of Thirty Acres of Land, to be continued to him and his Heirs for ever. To the Tune of, The two English Travellers. This may be printed, R. P. A Noble Man liv'd near a Village of late, Hard by a poor Thresher, whose charge it was great He had seven Children, & most of them small, And none but his Labour to keep them withal. He er was given to Idle and Lurk, This Noble Man seeing go daily to Work: His Flail, with his bag and his bottle of Beer, As cheerful as those that had hundreds a year. Thus careful and constant each morning he went To his dayly Labour with joy and content, So jocond and jolly, both Whistle and Sing, As blith and as brisk as a Bird in the Spring. One morning this Noble Man taking his Walk, He met with this Poor Man, and freely did talk; He asked him many a Question at large, Familiarly talking concerning his Charge. Thou hast many Children I very well know, Thy Labour is hard, and thy Wages is low, And yet thou art cheerful; I pray tell me true, How you do maintain them so well as you do. I carefully carry home all that I Earn, Now daily experience by this I do learn; That though it is possible we may live poor, We still keep a ravenous Woolf from the door. I Reap and I Mow, and I Harrow and Sow, Sometimes I to Hedging and Ditching do go: No work comes amiss, for I Thresh and I Plow, Thus I ear my Bread by the sweat of my Brow. My Wife she is willing to pull in the Yoak, We live like two Lambs, and we never provoke Each other, but like to the labouring Ant, We do our endeavour to keep us from want. And when I come home from my Labour at night, To my Wife and Children, in whom I delight, To hear them come round me with tatling noise, Now these are the Riches that poor men enjoys. Though I am as weary as weary may be, The youngest I commonly dance on my Knee: I find that Content is an absolute Feast, I've never repin'd at my Charge in the least. The Noble Man hearing then what he did say, Was pleas'd, and invited him home the next day: His Wife and his Children he charg'd them to bring In token of favour, he gave him a Ring. Then thanked his Honour, and taking his leave, He went to his Wife, who would hardly believe, But that this strange story himself he might raise, Yet seeing the Ring she was then in a maze. Betimes in the morning the good Wife arose, And made them all fine with the best of their Close. The good Man and Wife, with his Children small, They then was to Dine at the Noble Man's Hall. But when they came there, as the truth doth report, All things was prepar'd in a plentiful sort: And they at the Noble Mans Table did Dine, With all sorts of of Dainties, with plenty of VVine: All this being over, he soon let him know, VVhat he then intended on him to bestow: A Farm, with full thirty good Acres of Land And gave him the Writings then with his own hand Because thou wast careful and good to thy wife, I'le make thy days happy the rest of thy life It shall be for ever to thee and thy Heir, For why, I beheld thy Industrious Care. No tongue then was able in full to express, The depth of their joy, and their true thankfulness, With many a Courtsie and Bow to the ground, But such Noble Men there is few to be found. FINIS.
