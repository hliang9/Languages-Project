THE CASE OF The Officers, Ministers and At∣tendants of his Majesty's late Descent Train of Artillery, Commanded by Sir Martin Beckman. HIs Majesty, by Warrant under his Royal Sign Manual, bearing date the 28th of February, 1691/2, was graci∣ously pleas'd to constitute and appoint them to be in their respective Stations in the said Train; and they accordingly serv'd in Flanders in the Army commanded by the the then Duke of Leinster, until October 1692, at which time they were re-manded into England, and paid until the last of that month. By Order of the Principal Officers of his Majesty's Ordnance, they gave constant attendance at the Tower, and were muster'd from time to time, until the last day of March 1693, rendring an account of the several places of their abode, and were re∣strain'd from being absent without leave, that they might con∣tinually be in a readiness, in case his Majesty's Service shou'd at any time require their immediate appearance. They have not yet receiv'd any Allowance or Pay for their Service the said five Months, from the first of November 1692, to the last of March 1693, notwithstanding several Foreigners, who were upon the same foot and establishment, have been fully paid and clear'd the same, as appears by divers Warrants directed to the Earl of Ranelagh for that purpose, the Copies of which they can produce. Several of them, in performing the Duty of their Attendance, and for want of Pay, were compell'd to contract Debts, which are very urgent upon them, and for which some are now lying in Prison, to the great detriment of themselves and Families; which they may justly attribute to their not duly receiving their Pay, and by being confin'd by such attendance from following other lawful Occupations, whereby they might have earn'd subsistance.
