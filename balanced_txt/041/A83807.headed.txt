A Publike DECLARATION and PROTESTATION of the secured and secluded Members of the House of Commons; Against the treasonable and illegall late Acts and proceedings of some few Confederate Members of that dead House, since their forcible Exclusion, 13. Febr. 1648. WE the secured and secluded Members of the late House of Commons, taking into our sad and serious Considerations the late dangerous, desperate & treasonable proceedings of some few Members of that House (not amounting to a full eighth part of the House if divided into ten) who confederating with the Officers and General Councel of the Army, have forcibly detained and secluded us (against the Honour, Freedome, and Priviledges of Parliament) from Sitting and Voting freely with them, for the better setling of the Kingdomes peace; and contrary to their Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy, their Protestation, the Solemne League and Covenant, and sundry Declarations and Remonstrances of both Houses, to His late Murdered MAJESTY, His Heires, and Successours, the whole Kingdomes of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and to all foraigne States and Nations (since our exclusion and forced absence from their Counsels, by reason of the Armies force) most presumptuously arrogated and usurped to themselves the Title of, The supreme Authority of this Kingdome: and by colour and pretence there∣of, have wickedly and audaciously presumed, without and against our privities or consents, and against the unanimous Vote of the House of Peers, to erect a High Court of Justice (as they terme it) though never any Court themselves, to Arraigne and Condemne His Majesty against the lawes of God, and the municipall Lawes of the Realme: which Court (consisting for the most part of such partiall and engaged Persons who had for∣merly vowed His Majesties destruction, and sought His bloud) most illegally and unjustly refused to admit of His Majesties just Reasons and exceptions against their usurped Iurisdiction; and without any lawfull Authority or Proofe against Him, or legall Triall, presumed most trayte∣rously and impiously to Condemne and Murder Him: and since that, have likewise presumed to Trie and Arraigne some Peers, and others Free Subjects of this Realme for their Lives, contrary to Magna Charta, the Petition of Right, the Lawes of the Land, and the Liberty of the Subjects, to the great enslaving and endangering of the lives and liberties of all the Free People of England. And whereas the said confederated Commons, have likewise tyrannically and audaciously presumed contrary to their Oathes and Engagements aforesaid, to take upon them, to make Acts of Parliament (as they terme them) without our privity or assents, or the joynt consent of the King and House of Lords, contrary to the Use and Priviledges of Parliament and known Laws of the Land, and by pretext thereof have trayterously and wickedly endeavoured to Dis-inherit the Illustrious CHARLES Prince of Wales, next Heire to the Crowne, and actuall KING of Eng∣land, Scotland, France and Ireland, immediately after His said Royall Fathers barbarous Murther, by right of descent; and proclaimed it Trea∣son, for any Person to Proclaime Him KING; (whereas it is High Treason in them thus to prohibit His proclaiming) and have likewise trayte∣rously and impudently encroached a Tyrannicall and lawlesse Power to themselves to vote downe our auntient Kingly and Monarchicall Govern∣ment, & the House of Peers; and to make a New Great Seale of England without the King's Portraicture or Stile, & to alter the antient Regall and legall stile of Writs, and Proceedings in the Courts of Iustice; and to create New Iudges, and Commissioners of the Great Seale, and to dispense with their Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, and to prescribe New Oaths unto them contrary to Law, (though they have no Authority by any Law, Statute, or Custome to administer or injoyne an Oath to any man) and thereby have trayterously attempted to alter the fundamentall Laws and Government of this Kingdome, and to subvert the freedome, priviledges and beeing of Parliaments; for which Treasons, Strafford and Canterbury (though lesse criminall) lost their Heads this last Parliament, by some of their owne prosecutions, and the judgment of both Houses. We in discharge of our respective duties and obligations both to God, the King, our owne Consciences, our bleeding dying Kingdomes, and the severall Counties, Cities and Burroughs for which we serve, doe by this present Writing, in our owne Names, and in the Names of all the Counties, Cities, and Burroughs which We represented in Parliament, publickly declare and solemnly protest before the all-seeing God, the whole Kingdomes of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the world, that we doe from the bottome of our hearts abominate, renounce and disclaime all the said pretended Acts, Votes, and proceedings of the said confederate Members, (acted under the Armies power against our Consents) as treasonable, wicked, illegall, unparliamentary, tyrannicall, and pernitious both to the King, Parliament, Kingdomes, and all the free borne People of this Realme; extreamly disadvantagious and dishonourable to our Nation, scandalous to our Religion, and meer for∣cible Usurpations, and Nullities void in Law to all intents and purposes; which we, and all the Free-men of this Kingdome, and all the King∣domes and Dominions thereto belonging, are bound openly to disavow, oppugne, and resist as such, with our purses, armes, lives, to the last drop of our blouds; and to which, neither We, nor any other can, ought, or dare to submit or assent in the least degree, without incurring the guilt of High Treason, and the highest perjury, infamy & disloyalty. And in case the said Confederates shall not speedily retract, & desist from those their treasonable practises, and tyrannical usurpations; (which We cordially desire and entreat them by all obligations of love and respect they have to God, Religion, their King, Country, & Posterity timely to do.) We do hereby denounce & declare them to be Traytors & publike Enemies both to the King and Kingdome, and shall esteem and prosecute them, with all their wilfull Adherents, and voluntary Assistants as such; and endeavour to bring them to speedy and condigne Punishment, according to the Solemne League and Covenant; wherein, We trust the whole Kingdome, all those for whom We serve, and the Lord of Hosts himself to whom We have sworne and lifted up our hands, hearts, and fervent prayers will be aiding and assisting to us, and all our Brethren of Scotland & Ireland who are united & conjoyned with us in Covenant to our God, and Allegiance to our Soveraigne King CHARLES the Second, Who (we trust) will make good all His destroyed Fathers Conces∣sions which really concerne our peace, or safety, and secure us against all force and tyranny of our Fellow-subjects; who now, contrary to their Trusts and former Engagements, endeavour by the meer power of that Sword, which was purposely raised for the protection of our Persons, Government, Religion, Lawes, Liberties, the KING'S Royall Person and Posterity, and the Priviledges of Paaliament) to Lord it over Us at their pleasure, and enthrall and enslave Us to their armed violence, and lawlesse martiall Wills; which we can no longer tolerate nor undergoe, after so long fruitlesse and abused patience in hope of their repentance. FINIS.
