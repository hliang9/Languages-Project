A Relation of the victory, which the Sweads have had against the King of Den∣markes Forces in Jutland, As wee have it by Letters of good credit, from Hamborough, da∣ted, Jan. 16 & 19. WHat successe the Swedes have had in the King of Den∣marks Dominions, you have heard of it heretofore, I must acquaint you now with a further progress they have made. The Swedish Generall Major Coningsmarck having quartered for a time in the Bishopricke of Hildesheim, is now drawing with his forces into the Bishoprick of Bremen, the Bishop, who is second sonne to the King of Denmarke, being fled from Bremerfend to Stoad, the Swedish forces go on in taking one place after another to Hol∣stein and Iutland, and eing all under con∣tribution, till frost came, y  of the marsh grounds,
possessed themselves thereof, yet was with∣out blows, the peasants in the place called Wilster, had laid two Sconces upon the pas∣sage, which were assaulted by the Swedish forces, whom they of Gluekstatt, under∣standing, sent out a Captain with 100 men to assist them, but comming too late, the Swedes being Master of the first Sconce, the souldiers retired to the other Sconce, to join with them that kept it, but contrary to ex∣pectation, they finde that place forsaken by the peasants, so they in good time shifted for themselves, but were taken short, their Lievtenant slaine: This day also wee have news, that the Swedish forces have made themselves master of Ditmarsh, there being some 150 peasants slain, 300 taken prisoners, and some 200 fouldiers, that did assist them, have taken service under the Swedes: Wee have likewise newes this day, that the 600 leuied horse of the King of Denmark, which lay in Iutland, having joyned with the Gen∣try of the Country and Sleswyck being to∣gether strong 1600 horse, and foure compa∣nies of leavied foot are wholly routed by the Swedes, at a place called Colding, the chiefe
commander taken prisoner, together with eight captains more, and 400 slaine in the place, in so much that the King of Denmark will lose now all on this side the Beldt, and Gluekstatt will run now a great hazard. Wee We have also news from Sweden by a ship, that came in eight dayes from thence to Lu∣beck, that they have confiscated all Deanish goods in that Kingdome, and that Gustavus Horn was marchlng with an army of 20000 men into Schoven, which lyes on the other side of Denmark, insomuch that the King of Denmark will shortly be forced to say fare∣well Sound, but they that are good Danish say, that Commissioners of both Kingdoms are to meet the 15 present at Colmar, to ac∣commodate matters.
A COPY OF A LETTER sent by his Excellencie the Swedish Generall Torstensohn to Generall Major Mortagne, bearing date in the head Quarter Mid∣dlefart Sconce, the 14 of Jan. 1644. MY expedition against the Danish horse, I have communicated unto you in my last letter, where∣upon I presently advan∣ced and sate before the Campe, which they had pitched here, into which the Danish horsemen had retired, which having left there behind them their horses went in boats over the water, in the Campe a considerable number both of leaied souldi∣ers, and of the Peasants was drawn to∣gether, and for three or four dayes toge∣ther
I caused the Campe fiercely to hee battered with the Cannons, meanwhile the Danish RIX MARSHALL ANERTW BILL who was then there, betooke himselfe with the Cannons, Co∣lours, chiefest Officers, and the least part of the Common Souldiers to Mit∣tlefahrt leaving behinde him in the Campe the most part of the Souldiers, to∣gether with some Captains and under Officers: But when this day I advanced with the main strength of my Forces to∣wards it, and the Forces that lay in the Sconce, saw the strength of my Forces, they threw away their armes, and came running out of the Camp to meet us, in∣somuch that the most High God shewed us that favour, that together with a great part of the Horsmen; we took also 4500 foot (amongst which were a 1000 leavied Souldiers, which tooke all service under
us) without any losse, onely some few were wounded, amongst which was an Ensigne but the Peasants, which were mounted by the Gentry, were stript by some of our naked Souldiers, and turned home, some of them freely desired to serve under us; being now the Danish Forces are here by for the most part ruinated, and this Country freed and cleered, that by Gods assistance We need not to fear them, that on this side they will do us any hurt, for which fundamentall blovv vvee ought to give hearty thanks unto God Almightie, The Regiments are novv gone to their quarters, vvhich I thought to communi∣cate unto you, &c. FINIS.
