The Doubting Virgin, AND The Constant Youngman. Observe what here is put in Print, All you that do love merriment: It's for Young-Men and Maids also, Stay and hear 't o're before you go. Tune of, The Repriev'd Captive, By Tobias Brown. OH my dearest do not slight me, for my Love to thee is true, There is none but thee can right me, never change me for a new: You intrude me, and delude me, I think you cannot it deny, Now you leave me and deceive me, but can show no reason why. I wonder young-men are so crossful, since Virgins are so full of Love? That makes Maids to be bashful, thinking how young men will prove But if in proving they were loving, as they formerly pretend; Then how neatly and compleatly should we live till Life doth end. The Mans Answer. Oh my dear, why dost thou doubt me, that to thee I'le prove unkind I think my self not well without thee, thou art always in my mind; If I do leave thee or deceive thee, then I wish nothing may thrive, For let never my endeavour prosper whilst I am alive. THou art she whom I love dearly, what can any man say more, This is my mind I speak it freely, I never said so much before: Then sweet believe me, for it did grieve me to hear the moan my Love did make, My dearest Love i'le constant prove, or beleive no man for my sake. The Maids Answer. My dear, what can there be expected, whilst that we on earth de dwell, Let not true love be neglectted, then will every thing do well, This my speeches, though we have riches my sweet heart I you call, For all the mony my dear honey, true love is the best of all. Suppose that we had all the treasure that's in England to be seen, Or if that we had all the pleasure that belongeth to a Queen: Observe my speeches, I mean the riches that upon some men do fall, For all their pleasure, and their treasure; true love is the best of all. The Man. Why do you use such expression, unto me who am your own, My heart you have in your possession, unto you it is well known; Pray never doubt it, nor pause about it, my deatest love 'tis thou art she, Water shall burn, and wind ne'r turn, if that I prove false to thee, This full glass I hope to drink it, in remembrance of my dear, Happy is the hour I think it, that I met my true love here; Now in pleasure without measure, we will pass the time away, Come my sweet heart we'l kiss and part, for now we can no longer stay. So they parted for that instant, they both then were firm and true, If all young people were so constant, what need there be so much ado, There needs no weeping, nor lost sleeping if they did in love agree, Nor no shaking, nor heart breaking, pray observe this thing from me. FINIS. Printed for P. Brooksby at the Golden-Ball in Pye-Corner.
