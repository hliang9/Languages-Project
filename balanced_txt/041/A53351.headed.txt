On the DEATH of Sir Tho. Armstrong; IN ANSWER TO A LATE Treasonous LIBEL Dispers'd by the Factious. THou Monster Armstrong, cou'd thy Soul return But a few Minutes from her Sulph'rous Urn, To see the Joys that Loyal men imploy, At thy deserv'd, tho' Fatal Destiny: It wou'd (if possible) thy Pain increase, And add new Tortures to Hell's Miseries: Hadst thou still Safe been in thy Trayt'rous Flight, Thou hadst not come up to this wicked height; For th' Treasons that Thou Living did'st intend, Thou ne'r repent'st of at thy Fatal End: Just thus dy'd Peters, Harrison and Pride, Much better Catiline and Cethegus dy'd. If we shou'd tell how much he is too blame, 'Twould for a Volumn, be a Copious Theme: If once (if true) he Loyal were, 'tis all In his whole Life, that we can Virtuous call: But we have too much reason to believe, That even Then he did his King deceive; And so did never Change, was still a Rogue, Still Courting whatsoever Power in Vogue: And now his Quarters, most deserv'dly stand As Scare-Crows to the rest o'th' Factious Band;
The Peaceful Grave to this day ne'r contain'd, A Carcas like to His with Treason stain'd. But sure his Monstrous Spirit 'gain is risen Out of the dismal hole of Hells dark son, Has got a short Reprieve, and now Indicts All that this Horrid Impious Villain Writes: Nothing but Hells Dear Imp cou'd e'er devise, Such Horrid Treasons, Monstrous Blasphemies, Cou'd e'er rake up that Holy Marlyrs, Dust, Of our First Sacred Charles, the Good, the Just: Be Judge just Heaven, judge all on Earth below, Judge, and then tell me, if you er're cou'd shew One Vicious Act in the whole Blessed Reign Of that most Sacred Prince, by Traytors slain: And if into your Memory you call The true Idaea of the Original, You'll find in's Sons, he Copy'd is as True, As e'er in Imitation Titian drew: Our Sacred Charles is so averse to Blood, That (if he any Fault have) he's too Good, Shews too much Mercy to his Harden'd Foes, That wou'd Himself and Progeny Depose: Can the most Brazen'd Face o'th Factious Crew In Royal JAMES the least Injustice shew? No, tis their Grievance that the World Proclaims, No Truer Friend, no Juster man than JAMES: What Subjects then can e'r refuse t'obey, The Just and equal Poise of Charles's Sway? We need not (Rebels) on you Vengeance call, God lets the Rod of Justice on You fall; The Heavenly Wisdom all your Actions saw Your Preach of Faith, o'th Kings, and of his Law Since each of you is become Heavens Foe, Heavenâ–ªs Justice does the Punishment bestow. Prined and Sold by Nath. Thompson at the Entrance into the Old-Spring-Garden near Charing-Cross, 1684.
