For the Honourable VVilliam Lenthall Esquire, Speaker of the Honourable House of Commons. SIR, I Hope you Received my Letters concern∣ing the Battell; since that time the Army hath layen before Bridgewater, giving them Alarms day and night: There is in the Town above 30. pieces of Ordnance, whereof one is a Demy-Canon, another carries 32. pound bullet, strongly Fortified, deep Trenches; yet our Souldiers have their Bobbins in readi∣nesse, and were in hopes last night to have Stormed; a few dayes will starve them; good prize within. The Governour and his Lady, Sir Hugh Windham, his Son, Sir Iohn Digby, Sir Fr. Courtney, Tho. Elliot sore wounded, &c. A Convoy is gone for the Treasure at Lyme, it will much comfort the Souldier who de∣serves it well the Country suffers by the want of it: Goring is fled to Barstable, the Club-men being more terrible to him then
our Army, giving him Alarms, and disarm∣ing his men in Devonshire, as the Club-men of Somersetshire did: Hopton is fled to Ex∣eter, for France if he can; Sir Io: Staangewayes, and Sir Francis Dorrington fled into Wales; they see their condition desperate, and I hope shall do it every day more and more. Iuly 15. 1645. I am Sir your Servant. Our Ships in the River at Bri∣stoll, mightily terrifies the Enemy. I have sent you a List of the Offi∣cers taken; you will see 30 Regi∣ments in a manner broken, all Gorings best Horse were spoiled at this bout.

Common Souldiers taken 1200. whereof 500. have taken the Covenant and taken up Armes, being first ap∣proved by Mr. Ash, and Mr. Moor, Members of the Parliament. The inclosures being many, abundance of the Foot escaped and got to the club-men, who disarmed them, and gave them leave to go to their homes; they dis∣armed 300. at one time, Horse and Foot. Our men were so eager on the pursuit, that they left the prisoners to themselves to march back to the Ar∣my, who escaping, made the number fall short of that was assured they were of. There is in Bridgewater about 30. piece of Ordnance, 1000. Souldiers Welch and Townsmen, moated a∣bout, water deep, having the benefit of the Tide. FINIS.
