First deliuered in seuerall Sermons, and now published to the glory of God, and for the further benefit of his Church. By PETER BARKER, Preacher of Gods Word, at Stowre Paine, in Dorsetshire. Psal. 19. 7. The Law of the Lord is perfit, conuerting the soule; the testimony of the Lord is sure, and giueth wisdome vnto the simple. Esay. 8. 10. To the Law and to the Testimony. Printed at London for Roger Iackson, and are to be sold at his shop neer the great Conduit in Fleet-street, 1624.
To the Right worshipfull the Deane and Canons of the Cathedrall Church of Sarum, his very good Patrons. RIght Worshipfull, when contrary to my custome, I had penned these Sermons, I could not at first determine whether If I should smother them in my deske, or send them out into the common light: I should let them pe∣rish as soone as they were brought forth, happily some would endite me of closenes; If I should suffer the world to take a view of them, others would condemne me for profusion; especially seeing that this age being furnished with Bookes euen to satietie and surfet, may say of the Priests, as Bezaleel of the people; The people bring too much, and more then enough for the vse of the Tabernacle, Ex. 36. 5. But while I was thus musing, at last I resolued rather to presse then to suppresse them, and now they lay open to all censures: If your Worships shal thinke I sound from my emptines, yet blame me no more then you wil the ful handed, which commonly are most sparing: herein mine owne heart sometime endited a good matter, then with the spider did I weaue my webbe out of my owne breast: at other times my tongue was the pen of other Writers; then with the Bee did I ga∣ther hony out of the flowers, yet so as with the Dogge at the Riuer Ni∣lus I neuer did but touch and goe, lappe, and away, and being desirous to be rather Scriptor then Exscriptor, a water-spring then a leaden spout, did in gleaning commonly, make others mine owne for forme by many alterations. If your Worshps shal marke these my poore pains with your starres, you shall encourage mee the second time to put pen to paper; but if with your spits, your dislike shall driue me to a non plus, my second Sermons shall neuer stand in white sheetes, and so referring my selfe and my labour to your charitable censures: I rest your Worships in all duty and true affection P. Barker.

THE PREFACE vpon the ten Commandements. IN the first age of the world from Adam to Mo∣ses, men had no other guide to conduct them for the carriage of their liues, then the Law of Nature, which Saint Paul calleth Rom. 2. 1 a Law writ∣ten in the heart, and others ius gentium the law of nations, because all Nations had some glimpse of knowledge by it: but great things are not seen in the darke, nor little things in the common light, but in the sun beames the least mote may be discerned, so in the darknesse of nature great sins were little seene, and therefore the hea∣then thought simple fornication to be no sinne, but this the literall sense of the Law condemned. But the motions of the heart are discerned by the Law spiritually vnderstood, and therefore men being as young schollers, which cannot frame their letters without a Copy, God gaue them a Law written as a mould wherein to cast all their thoughts a touchstone wher∣by to try all their words, the Beame of the Sanctuary, where∣vpon all their actions should be ballanced, all their workes weighed, a written warrant without which a good man dare doe nothing, and with which what dare he not? This is the Morall Law contained in the tenne Commandements, vnto which this is the Preface, like the forefront of the Sanctuary like the sound of a trumpet before some weighty proclamation, a fore∣runner of the law, as Iohn of the Gospell with letters of com∣mendation.

GOd spake these words: 1 In other parts of the Bible God vsed other mens mouthes, Luc. 1. 70 he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, and 2 Pet. 1. 21 holy men of God spake as they were mooued by the holy Ghost: 2 he vsed other mens pens, there were Scribes which were the pens of Gods owne finger, as there were  so , 2 Chr. 24 11. mens Scribs called Notaries, Ier. 36. 10 Secretaries, 2 Reg. 18. 18. Recorders, and Ier. 8. 8. Gods Scribes whose office was to write the words of the Lord and to expound it; but in deliuering this law, God spake himselfe. The Decalogue was the immediate word of his owne mouth, he did Ex. 31. 18 write himselfe, he made his owne pen publike Notary of his tongue, his owne finger was the pen, so that we may say as the Inchaunters of Aegypt in another case, Ex. 8. 19. Digitus Dei est hic, this is the finger of God. This double dignity in speaking and writing, which the law hath aboue other scripture, teacheth vs to lend a most attentiu eare vnto it. The holy Ghost commends vnto vs some scriptures as more excellent then other, in respect of our vse or seuerall necessities, by remarkable notes, either in the beginning of the speach,
as Mat. 1. 23 behold, which marke of attention is as the ringing of a Bell before the sermon, or in the end of the speach as Ps. 3. 2.  Selah, which is a postcript, and teacheth vs to looke backe and in this case to be like Gen. 19. 26. Lots wife, who turned backe and looked behind her. Sometime the holy Ghost writeth more artificially then at other times as Psal. 111. 112. 119. some psalmes, and the Lamentations of Ieremy are written in an Alphabeticall order to note their dignity, and helpe the memory. Sometime the holy Ghost giueth some scripture a name aboue other names, as Dauid calleth the 120 Psalme and 14 Psalmes following, songs of Degrees, not for that the Leuites did raise the tune in singing those Psalmes, for these and other Psalmes had the like tune, nor yet because they were sung on the stayers of the temple, for Salomon built the temple after those Psalmes were stiled by that name, but because (as a learned writer of our time hath well obserued) they were excellent Psalmes of a higher degree, and more speciall vse. But neither note, nor name, nor any thing else can commend vnto vs any especiall scripture, whereby to moue attention so much as this which is superlatiue to them all, God deliuered the law with his owne mouth, God did write it with his owne fin∣ger, so that he might say for the one as Ioseph to his brethren; Gē. 45. 12 Beholde, your eyes doe see that mine owne mouth speaketh to you: and for the other, as Paul to Philemon, Philem. 19 I haue written this with mine owne hand. 2. God is a Iudge, his Law is a Charge, and when the Iudge doth giue the Charge, euery man is ready to harken to it. 3. There is an interchangeable speach betwixt God and vs, we speake vnto God in prayer and thankesgiuing, he spea∣keth to vs, by the audible sound of his word, or secret voice of his Spirit; we cry vnto God that he would heare vs, that our prayers may goe vp, and his mercy may come downe, that God and our prayers may meete together in heauen, Ioh. 4. 7. as Christ and the woman at Iacobs well, and God interchangeably crieth to vs that we would heare him: the voice that descended from heauen gaue nothing else in charge but this: Mat. 17. 5. heare him: as though other duties were comprised in hearing, and Christ
speake of hearing, when he told Martha, Luc. 10. 32. one thing was necessa∣ry, as though other necessities were to giue place vnto it. Pro. i. 24. 28. He that stoppeth his eares when God speaketh, shall speake himselfe and not be heard. Therefore be not like hounds, which haue their eares hanging towards the earth, by reason whereof the sound and voice cannot so soone enter; much lesse be like the deafe adder, Psal. 58. 4 which stoppeth her eares, but be like the little birds which peirk vp their heads when the dam doth bring them meat, and be ready to say with Samuel when God speaketh, 1 Sam. 3. 10. speake Lord thy seruant heareth. Secondly God speaketh. Therefore wash away the dregs of sinne before you come to heare, as the adder slips of her skin as the Eagle casts her bill, as blind Bartimeus the legger threwy Mar. 10. 50. away his cloke before he came vnto Christ. Es. 55. 1. Come to the waters and drinke, but be like the Serpent, who when he comes to drinke, first spues vp his poison. Gods law is pure, and will aske pure and cleane vessels wherein to keepe it; it is new wine, and will not be put into old stinking bottels: Ps. 119. 105. Gods word is a Lanterne and light, sinne is a curtaine drawne ouer the heart, which hideth and eclipseth the light from shining vnto you, and therfore first Iam. 1. 27. lay apart all filthinesse and superfluity of maliciousnesse, and then receiue with meeknesse the word that is graffed in you which is able to saue your soules. Thirdly, God speaketh: therefore heare with reuerence. If a Proclamation come from the King, we vncouer our heads to harken to it: when Iud. 3. 20. Ehud told Eglon, he had a message from God, he arose from his throne: Deu. 31. 26. The Arke wherein the law was put Ex. 25. 11 14. was within and without ouerlaid with pure gold. It was carried vpon barres that the Leuites might not touch it, that so the maiesty and dignity might breed in the people reuerence: when the Arke came from the Philistims, the Bethlemites recei∣ued it with great gladnesse, but vsing it with little reuerence, 1 Sam. 6, 19. it caused the destruction of many. It was not giuen in charge to the Elders of Israel to teach the people as it was to the Leuites, yet when the law was deliuered to the sonnes of Leui, Deu. 31. 9 it was also deliuered to the Elders, and they were ioyned as assistants with them,
that it might be the more reuerently regarded of the peo∣ple. If wee heare the law as Sarah did the message of the Angell, Gē. 18. 12 who laughed when shee heard it, or as Pharaoh did the message sent vnto him from God concerning the deliue∣rance of Israell, Ex. 5. 2. who blasphemed when he had heard it, or as Iehoiakim did the rowle which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Ieremy, er. 36. 23 who cut it in peeces with a penne-knife, and burnt it when hee had heard it, if wee can dispute and talke of it as though our tongues did runne vpon pattens, if we cast it behind vs Ps. 50. 17. as the vngodly in the fiftieth Psalme, then the excessiue reuerence of the Iewes shall condemne our de∣fect, who at this day heare and reade, keepe and vse the law of God with all reuerence, they neuer lay any other booke vpon the Bible; they wash their hands before they touch it, they will not sit vpon the bench where it li∣eth, as often as they open or shut it, they vse to kisse it. Fourthly, God speaketh therefore beleeue. That men might get credit to their lawes they were repor∣ted to bee inspired by the Gods at Rome, at Athens and o∣ther places, the Heathen gods were lying gods and dying gods, but God who gaue this law is trueth and life, and his law like himselfe, vera est, viua est, sana est, plana est, what he speaketh passeth by indenture, by couenant, by oath, before good witnesses, signed with the finger of the holy Ghost, and sealed with the bloud of the Sonne. 2. If inferiour persons speake they perswade by reason, knowing they haue no authority to giue them credit: Ex. 4. 1. They will not beleeue mee (saith Moses) they will say the Lord hath not appeared vnto thee, therefore the Lord tels him, hee shall haue a testimoniall, hee shall haue euidence to shew, the miracles which he worketh shall proue his commission: but Kings and Princes of their meere authority looke to be belee∣ued, here God speaketh 1 Tim. 6. 15. who is King of Kings, take the word of a King for it. 3. Ipse dixit, among Pythagoras schollers went current, if their master said it, it was enough, they set vp their rest, and shall not we that are schollers of Christ, giue the like credit to
our master in heauen? Beleeue when he saith he will visit, be∣leeue when he saith he will shew mercy. Neither doth the An∣gell vse any other argument to confirme the women in the re∣surrection then this, Mat. 28. 7 Loe I haue told you. Lastly, God speaketh. The law is his word, and therefore it must not goe in at one eare, and out at another, it must not be as musicke, which once ended there is no more remem∣brance of it, or as vntimely fruit, which perisheth as soone as it is brought forth: if it were of no reckoning, it were no matter, if it went as it came, if it were of little moment, it were no mat∣ter though it went no further then the outward eare, then the porters lodge; but it is purer then gold, yea then much fine gold, Mat. 13. 46. it is a pretious pearle, and therefore must be kept vn∣der locke and key in the closet of the heart, Col. 3. 16 it must dwell in vs, we must be like Iacob; Gē. 37. 11 who noted the saying, and like Mary, Luc. 2. 51 who kept all the sayings in her heart. If we can say as Iob in another case, Iob 16. 2. We haue often heard such a thing, and doe not incorporate it, and keepe it in vs, we shall receiue the same checke which the Iewes did, Io. 5. 38. His word haue yee not abiding in you. God spake all these words. When God would blesse the peo∣ple which kept his law, and curse the disobedient, Deut. 27. 12. &c. six Tribes should stand vpon mount Gerizhim to blesse, and six vpon mount Eball to curse, and the people should not be left out, for they should answer and say, So be it: In setting downe the Articles of our faith, it hath been held as a traditi∣on that Peter began, and afterwards euery Apostle added his Article, and therefore called the Apostles Creede, but in deli∣uering the Law, God was not one of six, nor one of twelue, he had no copertner but spake all himselfe as, Iams 2 11 He that said thou shalt not commit adultry, said also, thou shalt not kill, and so of the rest. If God spake all, then we must heare all, obey all. The Iewes could be content to heare Steuen, till he touched the dis∣ease; Noli me tangere, Act 7. 54 but then they gnashed at him with their teeth: to heare Paul, till he deliuered words which stood not with their liking, then they said, Act. 2. 22 Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not meet that hee should liue. The blasphemer who armes himselfe to strike the Lord with some deadly
wound can happily be content to heare the first, to heare the se∣cond commandement, but if God will speake further, he shall haue better leaue to hold his peace, if he will write further in the first table, he will be ready to cry manum de tabula, harpe no more on that string, vntoothsome is that truth, which trea∣deth downe his owne likings. The Adulterer waiteth for the twilight, and commonly faulteth in the darke, and because the seuenth commandement doth light him a candle, he doth not willingly giue it the hearing: and so of the rest, if any one commandement doth crosse the paths of our speciall delights, would wrest vs in tune, would call the eye of the soule home to it selfe, and make vs see a glimpse of that we would not, we can no more away with it, then the owle can with the sunshine, or then the frantick man can with him that bindeth him: Heb. 11. 25. Sin it selfe is sweet, but the checke of sin is bitter, and no commande∣ment gratious that is a censure of that iniquity we delight in, but God that speaketh all bids vs Deu 12. 28. heare all. Secondly: God spake all, therefore we must obey all. The breach of one commandement is enough to stanch the bloud of the dying Lord: he that is hurt may as well die of one mortall wound as of an hundred: the least forfeit forfeiteth the whole lease, the least leaking may drowne the ship, and Mat. 5. 19 he that shall breake one of these least commandements and teach men so, he shall be called the least in the Kingdome of heauen. This meeteth with those which can be content to abandon many sins, to obserue some commandements, but they haue a beloued sinne, and for that they will dispense with them∣selues, it is their darling and shall liue and die with them: Mar. 6. 20 Herod had many good motions, he feared Iohn, knowing that he was a iust man and an holy and reuerenced him, and when he heard him, he did many things and heard him gladly, but he will not leaue his brother Philips wife, say he what he will, in that he will not dance after Iohn Baptists pipe, but rather giue Iohns head to the dancing damsell, whordome is his delight, and he will haue a gappe for his incest. 2 King. 5. 17. 18. Naaman protesteth that he will doe seruice to no other God saue to the Lord: but yet he must needs be present at the seruice of Idols, and herein the Lord be mercifull vnto thy ser∣uant, who carries an vpright soule in a prostrate body: but what
is this, but as if the wife should say vnto her husband, hus∣band you shall haue my heart, but I pray beare with mee, if you take my body in bed with another man. The Israelites destroyed the Cittizens of Hay, but faedg Iosh. 8. 23 the King aliue, we can be content to stay many sins, to nip them on the head, and as if we had marshall law in our hand, when we see them cōdemned, presently proceede to execution, but we saue the King aliue and fauour some principall sin in our selues. The whoremonger saith, forgiue me the sweet sinne of lasciuiousnesse, if I come into the sinne of vsery, God then spears me not: but this is to be like Benhadad who recouers ofh 2 King. 8. 10. one disease, and presently dies of another. The cunning fisher vseth not one baite for all fishes, nor alwaies the same baite for the same fish, but as he sees the fish will bite so he baits his hooke, so Satan tempteth not all men to one sinne, nor alwaies the same man to the same sinne, but applyeth himselfe euery way, as he seeth euery man giuen ei∣ther by inclination of nature or condition of life, Some bite at pleasures, and he taketh them with the i daughters of Moab,Nū. 25. 1. other gape at riches, and to catch them he baites his hooke Luk. 14. 18. 19. with a Farme or with Oxen, 2 King. 5. 22. or a talent of siluer, other post for preferment as fast as Iehu hasted forth his chariot, 2 King. 9 20. he droe as if he had been mad: & if they may climbe vp to honor they care not though they climbe,  Sam. 14 as Ionathan and his armour bearer did to the Garison of the Philistines by the raggednesse of the rokes, he shewes to these some honorable place that is void, so he tooke Siluester the second, he by the diuels helpe got to be Pope on this condition, that after his death he should be his: Satan hath the length of euery mans foote, and then he fits him, thus vncleannesse is the sinne of one man, couetous∣nesse of another, ambition of a third, these they fauour, but God who spake all these words, forbiddeth all sinnes against his words, and therefore all must be eschewed, and Saint Paul will haue vs take a purgation which may ridde vs of all sinne, 1 Cor. 5. 7 purge out the old leauen, and make vs cast vp all corruption, as Christ when he cast out one diuell cast out all, Luc. 8. 33 euen a whole legion together. Indeed Princes vpon speciall occasions dispense with some of their subiects for penall statutes, as for example, fish-daies
are commanded to be obserued by a Statute 2. Ed. 6. 19. 5 Eliz. 5. vnder a sub pana, that the Tribe of Zabulon, Gē. 49.  which dwels by the Sea side might haue maintenance, Neh 13. 16. that Tyrus and such as liue vpon nauigation might haue vtterance for their commodi∣ties, that there may be maintenance of store, for Num. 11. 21. 22. what abun∣dance of flesh will a multitude consume in one moneth, that God▪ Gen. 1: who created the fishes of the sea, and Gen. 9. 2 gaue man an in∣terest therein, Ps. 10. 25. might haue praises as well for sea as land, but yet all persons which by notorious sicknesse shalbe enforced for the recouery of their health to eate flesh for the time of their sicknes, shall haue a licence to eate flesh vpon the daies for∣bidden, but God who spake all these words, binds vs all to all in generall, binds vs all to all in particular. Therefore the Pope is to blame two waies, 1. In leauing out one commandement, 2. In dispensing with other, and as the Papists when they put in print Origens worke vpon Iohn, left quite out the sixt Chapter, for feare it should reproue their errour touching the communion, so doe they omit in their prayer bookes, and catechismes the second commande∣ment, because it is sharpe and rips the heart-string of the Church of Rome, and to fill vp the number of ten, they deuide the tenth into two, and this hath been an vsuall custume among them, if they meete with any thing, that thwarts the grounds of Popery, they labour with some cunning glosse, as with a wrest to make it tune to the key thereof, if the glosse will not helpe (which many times is viperina, and eats out the bowels of the text) if no shift of Descant will serue the turne, then with the dash of a pen as with a spunge they blot it out cleane, and cut the knot which they cannot vntie: thus in keeping backe part, Act. 5. 2. as Ananias and Saphira, they are pickers of their ma∣sters treasure, and very theeues, which suppresse the markes whereby they may be knowne, least they should be taken, like the diuell in the Gospell, who when he tempteth Christ, pre∣sumption comes like a diuine, and brings the Psalter with him, but in alledging the psalme, he as subtile as the Cranes, who flying ouer the hill Taurus which is full of Eagles, cary stones in their mouthes, least their voice bewray them, concealeth these words; they shall keepe thee in all thy waies, because theyz Ps. 91. 11. made against him, the waies to which he tempted, being none
of Christs waies, and like the painter which Plutarch speaketh of, who when hee had drawne a hen in very badde pro∣portion, chased away the liuing hens from his shoppe win∣dow, lest his euill workmanship should be perceiued, but it fareth with them as it did with the painter in Queene Maries times, whom when he had painted King Henry the eight in har∣nesse, with a sword in the one hand, and a booke in the other, whereupon was written verbum Dei, the Bishop of Winchester sent for him, and after many reuiling words, commanded him to wipe out the booke and verbum Dei too, the painter because he would be sure to wipe out both cleane, wiped away a peece of the hand withall: and the Papists while they wipe out ver∣bum Dei, and take away what they please out of the word of God, haue wiped out their hand too, they cannot so much preuaile with men, seeing their leger de maine, as otherwise they might, no by this and the like meanes not onely their arme is shortened 1 Sam. 2. 31. like Elyes arme, but the very legs of their holy father the Pope are broken, Io. 19. 32 like the legs of the theeues, which were crucified with Christ. King Henry the eight broke his right leg of rents and reuenewes, whereas before that time his legs were strong like the legs of the image in Nebuchadnezars dreame, because many patrimonies went downe his throat, and by the foisted name of Peters patrimony, he deuoured the natu∣rall inheritance of secular Princes, whereas before that time his kitchin full of gridyrons and caldrons to broyle and boyle soules, was like an yron mill, which consumes all the wood in a country, and all the flouds in England did runne into his sea. King Edward the sixt broke his left leg, of Idolatrous seruice, when the temple was well purged, Images burned, when many papists shipt ouer their trinkets, and packt away their paltry; but our late Q. Elizabeth of famous memory crushed his head, Iud. 9. 53 like the woman who cast a peece of a milstone vpon the head of Abimelch, and brake his braine-pan. Secondly, if God spake all, and all must be obeyed, then is the Pope to blame to dispense with the law, or any part of it, yet hee alloweth of curtizans (who pay tribute for licence to be common whores, the Auditor of his Exchequer excommunicating those, which keepe not touch in bringing it in;) neither is onely fornication finable in Rome, and a good
alable kind of sinne, but very incest it selfe, for the Pope permitteth the brother to marry his wne brothers wife, and the vncle his sisters daughter. Neither dispenseth he with the breach of the seuenth Com∣mandement alone, but if hee bee displeaseed with the King, as he was with King Iohn, then against the fifth Commande∣ment hee assoileth Earles, Barons, Knights, and all other manner of men of their homages, seruices, and fealties that they should doe vnto him, commanding vnder paine of his great cuise, that no man should obey him, keepe him com∣pany, eate or drinke or talke with him, forbidding his owne houshold to doe him any kind of seruice, either at bed, or at boord, in Church, hall, or stable: But what need I speake of this or that particular Commandement, when the Cano∣nists say, he may dispense with the lawes of God and sinnes of men, that hee may dispense against the law of God, a∣against the law of Nature, against Saint Paul the Apostle, against the old, against the new, against all the Comman∣dements of the old and new Testament: May I not say vn∣to him as Moses to Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Nū. 16. 7 ye take too much vpon you, ye sonnes of Leui. But I proceed being indeede more desirous to lead men in the road way, then to shew them the turnings, or point at them that wander out of the way. I am the Lord thy God: Iudg. 14. 14. In Sampsons riddle, out of the strong came sweetnesse, hony out of the Lyons belly, here is a medely of the name according to Sampsons riddle, both of strong and sweet: the Lord, see how strong God is: thy God; taste and see how sweet the Lord is: hee is forter suauis, and suauiter fortis, there is a sweet entercourse of both, that both the one and the other might winne obedience to the law. I am the Lord: God hath a Lordship in heauen, where he hath good seruants; in hell where hee hath bad, in earth where hee hath both: hee is not a God of heauen alone, as the Poets feined Iupiter, not of hell alone, as they fained Pluto, nor of earth alone, as 1 King. 20 23. the Aramites spake, as though there were gods of the mountaines, and gods of the vallies, but of all.
The Pope, though he hath but some angle, not all the cor∣ners of the earth, though he is but as a foxe in a hole, yet the Papists say as much of him, as God saith here of himselfe: his discreet Doctors say, he is potestate maximus, bonitate optimus, which Epithites in former times were proper to God, who was called, Deus Optimus Maximus. Others say, he is not wholy God, nor wholy man, and this was true in Pope Ioane, they speake righter then they are aware, for she was a wo∣man: but a Canonist saith plainly, onr Lord God the Pope, and the Pope (as Bishop Iewell reporteth) was content to suffer one of his parasites to say vnto him in the late Counsell of La∣teran, Thou art another God on earth, and he weareth a triple crowne, either because he would vsurpe the Antichristian pow∣er ouer the three diuisions of the world, Europe, Asia, and Affricke; or else for that he would be a Lord of heauen, where he may Canonize Saints of hell, where he may free soules out of Purgatory, of the earth, where he may bind and loose, set vp and put downe at his pleasure, and because happily you will not beleeue their owne bare words, you shall heare how they bring scripture for it, Ps. 8. 6. he hath put all things in subiection vnder his feet, the beasts of the field .i. men liuing on the earth, the fishes in the sea .i. soules in Purgatory, the foules of the ayre .i. the soules of the blessed, risum teneatis? this would make Hera∣clitus himselfe, who alwaies wept to fall a laughing, it were present remedy against all his teares. But in earnest, if the Pope cannot doe this, why doe they attribute so much vnto him: if he can, what can God doe more? he can say no more in generall tearmes to shew his power and dominion, to shew his mercy and goodnes then this, I am the Lord thy God. A Lord whose title is alike to all places, and therefore in∣ordinate quarunt Io. 8. 19. vbi est, quia vbique est, the Pharisees should not aske where he is? but where is he not? he is a circle whose centre is no where, and circumference euery where; he filleth all things, not that they containe him, but rather that he con∣tains them; he is whole in all things, and all things in him, and as he beareth vp heauen and earth, and yet is not burdened, so he filleth heauen and earth, and yet is not inclosed. Heauen is his chamber of presence, there he is by glory, the heart of his
elect is his preuy chamber, there he is by grace, and though he be farre off from the thoughts of the wicked, yet is he not away, for where he is absent by grace, there is he present by vengeance. The argument then is this, I am the Lord, therefore you that are seruants must obey: Mat. 8. 8. I say to my seruant doe this, and he doth it: It is Grrans obseruation. The other Apostles call Christ Mat. 26. 22. 25. Lord, because they meant to obey him, but Iudas doth not so, because he had shaken off the yoke of obedience: they say , but he : howsoeuer it come to passe that our Gene∣ua translation in English make no difference in the title. Luc. 19. 3. 8. Zacheus desired to see Iesus, because he needed a sauiour, by and by he called him Lord, as though he were at his beck to doe his will. The whole order of nature is nought else then a proofe of the obdience, which all creatures both aboue and beneath yeeld vnto the Lord, the Iob 37. 12. Raine, Winde, and Stormes execute that he commandeth: Mat. 8. 27 The Sea obey him, when he stilleth the raging waues thereof, when he treads vpon it, as his freehold, Mat. 14. 25. when it is so stiffe, that he may walke vpon it. Luc 5. 6. 7 The inhabitants of the sea obey him, when they come thicke and three-fold into Simons net. The earth obey Ioh. 11. 43 him, when he bids Lazarus come forth. The heauens obey him, Act. 1. 9. when it openeth and receiueth him into glory. This is sufficient eui∣dence to condemne vs, and shall set a glosse on our rebellion, if we which haue sense, wit, and reason, shall disobey, if the heart of our heart, and the inmost concauity thereof, which is made to containe vitall breath, be not filled vp with subiecti∣on to the will of the Lord, that we can say euery one of vs, thy law is within my heart. The Lord thy God: the Lord of all by right of possion, the Lord God by right of ereation, but the Lord thy God O Is∣raell by ight of speciall election, for thou art separated from other Conntries as Es. 20. 6. an Ile from other lands. 1 Pet. 2. 25. God is a Bishop, and Mat 28. 19. he giues his Apostles a commission to visit all other Diocesses of the world, but Israel was a Pe∣culiar, and this Luc. 1. 68 he visited in his owne person, Deut. 7. 6 others were as the Commnos of the world, these as Gods owne inclosure: Other nations like wilde beasts wandred among mountaines,
woods and deserts, these as his owne flocke hee receiued into his folde, Hos. 11. 3. 4. Hee ledde Ephraim as one should beare them in his armes, hee ledde them with cords of a man euen with bands of loue: They which voluntarily come into any Kings dominion, euen by the common law of Nations are subiects to that King, Gē. 46. 6 Iacob and his family goe into Egypt, yet God giues them a priui∣ledge, calling in Israel his sonne and Ex. 4. 22. his first borne. At the first, before the couenant God made with Abraham, one person was not more respected then another, but as soone as it was said, Gen. 17. 7 I will bee thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee, the Church was diuided from other nations, no otherwise then light was from darkenesse in the first creation, but as in the time of Brutus (sic paris componere magna solemus) Bri∣taine was but one Monarchy, which after him was diuided into three Kingdomes, till our gratious King Iames pulled downe the partition wall, and ioyned not onely Roses but Realmes together; so the people of the world before the couenant, being of one and the same condition, and all alike vnder one God, were afterwards diuided into Iewes and Gentiles, and one much more respected then the other, till Christ the Prince of peace came, who breaking downe the wall of partition made, an vni∣on, made of Iewes and Gentiles one people, so that Rō. 2. 29 he is not now a God of the Iewes alone, but of the Gentiles also: and the Greeks may as well say Christ, as the Hebrews Iesus: the one Rō. 8. 15 , as well as the other Abba, and this, that God is our God, is the se∣cond argument here vsed to allure vs to obedience: Gen. 27. 12. Iacob is afraid to abuse old Isaac, because he is his father: Gē. 39. 8 Ioseph will not consent to the inticements of his mistrisse, because Putifar is his good master; and we must be afraid to offend, because we haue a good Father, a good Master, a good God: if we wan∣der out of the way and go astray from his Commandements, turning aside to the right hand, or to the left he may iustly chal∣lenge vs, and say▪ I am thy God, thy God, why hast thou forsaken mee? 1 King. 12 . The gray-headed Counsellors in Israell which had stood before Salomon while he yet liued, told Rehoboam his sonne, If thou speake kind words vnto this people this day, they will bee thy ser∣uants for euer: God speaketh kinde words vnto vs this day, I am the Lord, I am thy God, and therefore wee must not bee
seruants vnto sinne, but in a resolute detestation, whipping that bad merchant out of the temple of our heart, be his ser∣uants for euer. Which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt: Egypt was a land full of superstition: it honoured diuels, it honoured men, it honoured beasts, it honoured plants, what thing was it, but it was to them a God? and therefore this was a great fauour of God to be deliuered out of it: Nature hath ingrafted in eue∣ry creature to loue the place where it tooke birth and begin∣ning: Ecc. 1. 7. The Riuers goe to the Sea from whence they came: Gen. 8. 9 The Doue returned to the Arke, from whence shee came forth: 1 King 11 22. Hadad lacketh nothing with Pharaoh, yet in any case will goe into his owne Country; but yet if Caldea the place of Abrahams natiuity serueth strange gods, then the Lord saith vnto him, Gē. 12. 1 Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy kin∣dred, and from thy fathers house: and Ioshua Iosh. 24 2 reckoneth this among the great blessings of God, that God brought him from thence, and Gen. 11. 31. Terah his father an old man, weake and broken, hauing no commandement from God to goe with his son, which might haue seemed tollerable excuses, if he had abode behind yet when he knowes the place accursed for idolatry, from which his sonmust depart, he beares him company, the contagion of spirituall diseases, being as the lepers sore, dan∣gerous to them that dwell neere it, and therefore the holy Ghost Ier. 51 6. wisheth vs to goe out of Babylon, and looking be∣hinde vs, see whether wee haue left it vpon our backes: Bee not seperated from the company of good men, thou maiest participate of their goodnesse, as an impe grafted into a stocke participates of the influence and vertue of the roote, so that it withers not, but waxeth green and greater: if there bee Moses and Elias good company, good doctrine, good example, good report make choice of those places, and say with Peter, Mat. 17. 4▪ It is good to bee heere: but bee not like the Swine, who had rather bee tumbling in the mire, then laid in the cleanest places, come not neere stinking carrion, except thou haue the winde of it. But let vs take a little further view of this peoples idolatry, and then come to our selues. The Egyptians were such as Saint Paul speaketh of, Rō. 1 23. They
1 turned the glory of the incorruptible God, to the similitude of the image of a corruptible man, and 2. of birds, and 3. foure-footed beasts, and 4. of creeping things. 1 Of a corruptible man, they deified their King Axis. 2 Of birds, they worshipped the Hawke and Ebi, for that he destroyed the serpents which came out of Libia into Egypt, very hurtfull to their Country. 3 Of foure-footed beasts, they worshipped an Oxe, a Dogge, a Cat, and a Swine, for the inuention of tillage, which he shewed them, by rooting vp the ground with his groine. 4 Of creeping things, they worshipped the Crocodyll, and some Ichneumon, now called a mouse of Indie, who killeth the Cro∣codyll, for when the Crocodyll gapeth, he creepeth into his body, and eating his bowels, slaieth him: they had so many gods, that a man had need to haue made a Catalogue of them, as Vano did of the Romish gods, for feare (as he said) they should stray away: It may be this land had not the like variety of ima∣ges, but that here were canonized many new gods, both he Saints and she Saints, none can deny; men thought God could not attend to so many things at once, and therefore seuerall offices were committed to seuerall Saints, and they dealt out the vertues belonged to God: Saint Cornelis was an excellent Saint to keepe men from the falling sicknesse: Saint Apolline as excellent to helpe men of the toothach, these were not so good for men, but other were as good for beasts, as Saint An∣tony for Swine. If men did heare that some blocke-idoll did sweate, did speake, did weepe, did smile, did shift it selfe from place to place, would not their bare feet carry them thither with an offering? what repaire was there to our Lady of Walsingam, our Lady of Wilsdon, the same Lady but distinguished by the place, as Baal was a common name to many Idols, but distin∣guished Num. 22. 41. & 25. 3. by the high places and hilles wherein it was worship∣ped: but did God bring vs out of this land when it was infe∣cted with superstition, surely he shewed this fauour to many of our predecessors, who counted themselues happy, if while those Mariana tempora continued, they might goe to Geneua, to Strasbourg, and other religious places, whereas many many, which kept their station, did sticke ad ignem inclusiue, the father
with the sonne, the husband with the wife, the mother with the new borne, no not borne infant, for in the Ile of Garnesye the belly of Perotine Massey bursting asunder by vehemency of the flame, the child with which shee was great, fell into the fire, and eft soone being taken out by one W. House, was againe by the censure of the Prouost and Bailiffe cast into the fire, so that this child baptized in his owne bloud, both at once began and ended a Martyr: but God hath shewed a farre greater fauour to vs, then to those which auoided the land, for many of them might say, as Paul of himselfe, Night and dayt 2 Cor. 11 25. 26. 27. haue I been in the deepe sea: in iorneying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of mine owne nation, in perils among the Gentiles, in perils in the citty, in perils in the wildernesse, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren, in wearinesse and painfulnesse, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakednesse. But we without this trauaile, without this trouble, with∣out this danger are freed from superstition: God hath not brought vs out of an idolatrous land, but hath taken idolatry out of the land, and we continuing still in our natiue Coun∣try, he hath cleansed it, hauing swept idolatry and superstiti∣on from it: he cast that Dagon of Rome downe to the ground, when in the daies of King Henry the eight, the Pope lost his su∣premacy, when that King would sit no longer, as in the distin∣guishing at Paris, to pay the minstrels wages, when England, which before that time was counted the Popes Asse, did now cast his rider: he cut off his head and his hands, when in the daies of King Edward the sixt, men might not prostrate them∣selues before Saints seuerall shrines, nor prouoke God with high places, nor sacrifice vnto Baalim, and burne incense to images, but must take away their fornications out of their sight, and their adulteries from betweene their breasts: onely the stumpe of Dagon is left (a few recusants which our mighty King Iames by the helpe of God will sooner cast out, then it shall recouer it first wounds, & those disordered members, the Papists are now but as parts of an adder cut asunder, which may retaine some life for a time, but neuer by the grace of God shall in this land grow into a body againe: Now if the Pro∣phet Ieremy blameth the Iewes, for that they said not, Ier. 2. 6. Where
is the Lord that brought vs vp out of the land of Egypt, much more will he condemne our silence, if we doe not open our lips and shew forth the praises of God, who hath taken the superstition of Egypt out of our land. If this was a blessing of God vpon Israell, to bee brought out of Egypt, because there the Egyptians entitle  creatures to the honour of the creator, and gaue God for companions not men alone, but fowles of the ayre, and beasts of the field; they then are much to be blamed, who being bred and borne, and brought vp in that Country void of idolatry, in a Country which burne their images with fire, ouerthrow their altars, cut downe their groues, pluck downe their high places, and beaking in peeces the Calfe of Samaria will make no mention of it with ther lips, yet leauing this their country, conuey them∣selues into Egypt, into places which bringing in Idols put God and his truth out of doores, who with a wicked eye ha∣sting to riches, and coueting an euill couetousnesse, and being desirous to loade themselues with thicke clay, or vpon a dis∣contented humour, or to get them a name contrary to the com∣mandement of God, Amos 5. 5. seeke Bethell, when it is Bethauen, enter into Gilgall, and goe to Beersheba. Ioh. 4. 9. The Iewes would not meddle with the Samaritaus, and this law among them was like the decree of the Persian King that altred not, He that eates a Samaritans bread, bee as he that eats swines flesh: and on the otherside, the Samaritans would not conuerse with the Iewes, no if one of them had but toucht a Iew, he would haue thoughi himselfe the worse, till he had throwne himselfe into the water cloathes and all: The cleane and the leprous will not dwell together, nor the tame beasts keepe with the wilde. What shall we say then of such, as being▪ separated from idolatrous wine, will seeke to ioyne them∣selues vnto her againe. when God is not serued and worshipped aright, they forget what Paul taught Tim first by pre∣cept;  Tim. 6. 5 from such separate thy selfe: and then by  when Act. 19. 8. 9. he departed from Ephesus, after the way of God  spoken off before the multitude: Heb. 11. 24. Moses left Pharaohs Court, and had rather wander in the wildernesse, then be conciled to su∣perstitious Egypt then fall againe, what shall we say of such as being separated from idolaters, will seeke to ioyne themselues
to them? Paul saith, 1 Cor. 1 14. Fly from idolatry: then how are they to blame that flye to it, to places full of it, Which seate them∣selues there, and seing their gaines come in, set their hearts at rest, and say this is my rest, here will I dwell, I haue a de∣light in it: to be short, if thou now makest thy abode in Idola∣trous Egypt, which is stained with it owne workes, and goes a whoring whit it owne inuentions, which boweth it knees vn∣to Baall, and kisseth him with it mouth, say not as Peter of an other place, Mat. 17. 4. it is good to be here, but Mat. 9. 5. arise and walke: as Christ saith to the palsie man, and thinke thou hearest the voice of the Lord speaking to thee, as the Bridegrome to the Spouse, Chron. 2 10. 13. Arise my loue, my faire one and come thy way: if thou art come out of Egypt, out of a place where thy fathers worshipped strange gods, say not with Hobab, Num. 10. 30. I will againe to my Country and my kinred: but thinke thou hearest the vioce of the Lord speaking to thee as Salomon to Pharaohs daughter, Forget thine owne people, and thy fathers house: say not with the Israelites, when they arei Ps. 45. 10. come to the borders of Caanan, Num. 14 4. wee will returne againe into Egypt: but say with Ephraim. Hos. 14. 9 what haue we to doe any more with Idols? Be not like Orphah who being in her way to Bethlehem, Ru. 1. 15 goeth backe againe to her gods, nor like the ships, Ps. 107. 26. which goe vp to the heauen, and downe agoine to the deepe, nor like swine, 1 Pet. 2. 22. which being washed turne againe to the muddle and to the mire. Out of the house of bondage: Nimrod was a tyrannicall oppres∣sor, an oppressing tyrant, his cruelty was such, that (as hated both of God and man) it grew into a prouerbe, Gē. 10. 9. Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord: hunting hath snares and nets, and death at the last, but —Gaudeto Nimrod, vincit te crimine Pharaoh. Pharaoh thou hast not walked after Nimrods waies, nor done af∣ter his his oppression, but as though his hunting had been a ve∣ry little thing, ou hast been more cruell then hee, his cruel∣ty was not heard off in the day of thy oppression, hee hath not vsed halfe thy tyranny, but thou hast exceeded him, iustified him, comforted him, and made his cruelty mercy; but when God diee, that Israell his first borne was calamitatis fa∣bula, infalicitatis tabula, that it could not breath from it first crosse in body, but it must feele a worse in losse of children, the
cruell commands did come from the King like Iobs messen∣gers, Iob 1. no sooner one had told his tale, but another stepped in, Ps. 42. 7. as one departs, calleth another, then Hos. 11. 1. out of Egypt God cal∣led his sonne, Ps. 105. 26. then sent hee Moses his seruant to be a deliue∣rer, to bring Israell out of Egypt, Deu. 4. 20. out of the yron furnace, out of miserable slauery, out of the house of bondage, Ps. 81. 6. then did God withdrawe his shoulder from the burden, and his hand did leaue the pots, so that the Israelites might say of their former miseries, Ioh. 8. as the Adultresse of her accusers, they are all gon: The Doctrins are two. 1. Many cloudy daies goe ouer the heads of the godly, and Iob 22. 11. abundance of waters couer them. 2. Ps. 3. 3. God is the lifter vp of their heads, and 2 Sam. 22 17. drawes them out of many waters. God ioynes these two together; Deut. 32. 39. I kill and giue life: I wound, and I make whole: so doth Hannah in her songe, 1 Sam. 2. 6 the Lord killeth and maketh aliue, bringeth downe to the graue, and raiseth vp: and Eli∣phaz in his reproofe, Iob. 5. 18. 19. he maketh the wound, and bindeth it vp: he smi∣teth, and his hands make whole, he shall deliuer thee in six troubles, and in the seuenth the euill shall not touch thee. In the first Gods hand is heauy, in the second his mercy is plentifull: In the first the sun is shadowed with clouds, in the second it shineth out bright: in the first Es. 8. 17. God turneth his backe vpon Israell, and hides his face from the house of Iacob, in the second he Ex. 2. 25. looketh vpon the children of Israell, and hath respect vnto them: In the first Ps. 10. 1. God standeth farre off, in the second Phil. 4. 5. the Lord is euen at hand. But lest I should seeme with Abraham Gē. 18. 1 to sit still in the tent dore, giue me leaue to goe a little further into the house of bondage and make priuy search what I can finde by the going in, by the going out of Israell. God brought Israell into the yron furnace, to shew that Iob 23 10. the righteous must passe through afflictions, as gold passeth through the fire. Gods children are as 1 Pet. 2. 5. liuely stones to make a spiritual house, & therefore must be hewed, must be beaten, must be polished, as were 1 King. 6 7. the stones that serued for Salomons temple, at the Quarries side. Mat. 8. 27 The ship whereinto Christ entred with his disciples was so tossed with wind and waues, as if it would haue been ouer∣whelmed.
The fruitfull tree is beaten, whereas we meddle not with that, which being fruitlesse is reserued for the fire: Christ be∣gan to vs of a most bitter cup, but hee did not drinke it off, for hee said, Mat. 26. 39. Let this cuppe passe, they that are his, must pledge him of it: it was the saying of a good martyr, when we learned A. B. C. our lesson was Christs Crosse, the Crosse is the worke-house in which God frames his seruants like to his sonne: Gods children are as well called 2 Tim. 2. 3. souldiers to shew what they must suffer as Mat. 20. 8 labourers to shew what they must doe. Wee are to God as the aple of his eye, no part of man more tender then the eye, yet when it is sore or dimme wee put sharpe pouders or waters in it, to eate ont the webbe, pearle or blindnesse of it: nay there is no greater temptation, then not to bee tempted, no sharper whippe, then not to bee scourged of God: Ezec. 16. 24. I will cease and bee no more angry saith the Lord; God is then most angry (saith Bernard) when hee is not angry, this pitty is beyond all wrath: There are two punish∣ments of God vpon Israell, because they went a whoring from vnder their God: Hos. 4. 13. 14. the first punishment is sinne by sinne, when God turns malum culpa into malum poenae, your daughters shalbe harlots, and your spouses shalbe whores. The second punishment is want of punishment, and this is a greater then that, I will not vi∣sit your daughters when they are harlots, nor your spouses when they are whores: The vine waxeth wilde, if it be neuer cut, the sea would be infected and stincke if it were not troubled with the winds: the crosse is a fyer to consume the refuse metall, a file to take away the rust of the soule, a purgation to expell corrupt humours, a rodde which falling vpon stony hearts causeth them to bring forth teares, Num. 20. 11. as the waters gushed out when Mo∣ses with his rodde smote the stony rocke: Iob 16. 15. 16. when God rayned Iob with a rough byt, he stooped vnder his hand and vttered signes of repentance. The vse of this doctrine is manifold: First in respect of the agent, it abateth the edge of euery crosse to consider, it comes from the hand of God, the child is content to beare with his father who brings him vp, though he be rough to him, though he visit his offences with the rodde and his sinne which scour∣ges: God is our father y and brings vs vp as children, if he nur∣tureth
vs, Deu 8. 5 as a father nurtureth his sonne, as it is in Deutrono∣my, and 2 Sam. 7. 14. chastneth vs with the rodde of men, as it is in Samuell, this consideration doth relish the griefe, Ex. 15. 25 as the tree cast into the spring seasoned the bitternesse of the waters it is my father let him doe what seemed him good. The Oxe is without vnderstanding, yet knoweth his owner,c Esa. 1. 3. and holdeth downe his hornes, and boweth his necke to beare the yoke that hee doth put vpon him. If a strainger strike the sauage beasts, they teare him in peeces, but if their keeper smite them, they grudge not, Iob 7. 20 & Gen. 28 15. God is the keeper of men, this is armour of proofe, and will ward the blow of euery repining thought, and breaking the stroake of euery crosse, will saue the heart, when the body suffers to consider, my Keeper smites mee. God is a phisition, and knoweth what is better for vs then we for our selues, nothing displeaseth the patient that pleaseth the Phisition. Blowes of our equals we hardly digest, but will secke to put in practise, whatsoeuer desire of reuenge doth put into our heads, but wee neuer storme at a blow from a Prince, God is a Prince, a King of Kings, if he strikes, this doth moderate the stroake, and must make vs incounter the griefe with strength of resolution. Againe in respect of the patients: Afflictions must not make vs thinke, God loues vs the lesse, when we see his first born and best beloued in greatest calamitie. God made Iob a by-word of the people, that is so afflicted him, that all the world talked of him, and therefore he speaketh of astonishment, Iob 17. 6. 8. righteous shalbe astonied at this, as if they did imagine, God had turned his backe, and respected not his children, that hee would not thinke on worldly things, or passe how men liued, but he concludeth, the righteous will hold their way, and consider that God in his wisdome doth punish both the good and the bad, and in very deed there could bee no shew of patience, if God did still grant his seruants a patent of exemption and a priuiledge, and alwaies suspend the effects from their causes (for if they haue not open, yet at lest they haue secret sinnes) and stay the streames of waters, that they should neuer couer them: what victory can there bee where there is no fight? what grace can be giuen to ouercome, where
there is no temptation of the flesh? and what patience, where there neuer is crosse? besides, how could it bee knowne that God deliuers his children out of troubles, as he doth here out of bondage, if they neuer were in them? how should they know what it were to call vpon God, and to feele his good∣nesse towards them? therefore he punisheth both, though hee smiteth the wicked with his fist, the godly with the palme of his hand, though he Esa. 30. 28. fanneth those wtih the fanne of vanity to driue them to nothing, Mat 3. 12 these with his wheat fanne to cleanse them, though his punishments be Ex. 11. 1. plagues, Gen. 4. 11 curses, and destructions vpon the one, Ps. 89. 32 corrections, chastisements and roddes on the other. An other vse is this, let no man at any time so fixe his minde vpon his prosperous estate, as to resolute himselfe, it shall neuer change for the sunne-shined bright vpon Iacob Gen. 47. when he with his family came into Egypt, when his posterity were multi∣plyed and were exceeding mighty, but it waxed dimme when Ex. 1. 7. 8. 9. a King arose that knew not Ioseph: the sea at full tide ebbed, the calme continued not long without a storme, and all the sailes hoised gaue vantage to a tempest, therefore the heathen painted fortune with feete and wings because shee comes run∣ning and goes flying. Iob said Iob. 29. 18. I shall die in my nest, not drea∣ming of any trouble: and Dauid in his prosperity said, Ps. 30. 6. I shall neuer bee moued: but both these reckoned without their host, and therefore might reckon twice, God did hide his face and they were both troubled; if God dealeth thus with those that are his, what may either the better sort promise to themselues, or the euill not feare? he that is mounted on high knowes not how soone he may fall from the toppe to the foote of the hill: Est. 7. 10 Haman at least was as high on his own gallowes, as at first he was high in the Kings fauour. Daniel is no sooner made Ruler ouer the Gouernours, but by vertue of an Act made against him, Deu. 6. 16 he is cast into the Ly∣ons den: Ioseph from the degree of honour which hee had in Egypt, is Gen. 39. 20. taken and cast into prison, and that without baile or mainprise, (Ps. 105. 18. for they held his feete in the flocks, and hee was lai inyrons) with an intent, that from thence hee might be drawne vnto death: and for the womankind she that is now Nmi, vpon suddaine accidents which by Gods prouidence
may fall out, may say, Ru. 1. 20. call mee not Naomi, but call mee Mara, for God hath giuen mee much bitternesse, and falling into the widowes misery, may change her name to the likenesse of her lot: In a word, if God send health, wealth, and liberty, Deu. 12. 7. reioyce, but bee not drunke with it, doe not so rest thy selfe on these present benefits, that thou thinke the case cannot alter, and if it alter, be not impatient of a change, but say with Paul, Phil. 4. 11 12. I haue learned in whatsoeuer state I am therewith to be content, I can be aba∣sed and I can abunde, euery where in all things: I am instructed both to full, and to be hungry, and to abounde and to haue want. Lastly, because afflictions will make their way vpon vs, and campe about our tabernacle; it is a good course to make them present in conceit, before God sends them in euent: In resolued minds it taketh away the smart of euils to attend their comming, Nam leuius ledit quicquid prauidimus ante. foreseene mischeiefes hurt not so much, as they which come vn∣looked for. One cause why troubles are so combersome and grieuous, is because they happen to vnwilling minds, and therefore not onely carry the crosse, but Mat. 16. 24. take it vp, that is, suffer willing∣ly, and voluntarily beare what thou canst not auoide: another cause is, that they happen to vnwitting minds, therefore in a calme forest a storme, forecast the worst of all euents, pre∣uent them in thought, they will bee halfe digested before they come, speake with crosses (which thou accountest thy enemies) in the gate, meet them, as Gē. 19. 6 Lot did the Sodomites, before they came into his house: incounter them, as 1 Mac. 12. 25. Ionathan did his ene∣mies before they came into his country. But I proceede to the second generall doctrine, which is this. Ps. 4. 1. God setteth his children at liberty when they are in di∣stresse, as here hee bringeth Israell out of the house of bon∣dage. As he deliuereth from euils by preuention, in euils by susten∣tation, so out of euils by giuing issue, when hauing punished, he giues a Quietus est. The Sun shadowed with clouds within a while shineth out bright.
Ps. 107. 28. The mariners which abide the stormes of the sea, are with∣in a while brought to their desired hauen: Mat. 8, 25 Christ did awake when the ship was like to be couered with waues, and Mat. 14. 31. tooke Peter by the hand when hee was almost vnder water: Ex. 3. 2. The Bush burned, but it was not consumed: God eclipseth the good to shew that their light was but borrowed, but their light shall returne, whereas the candle of the wicked shalbe put out: The Whale Ion. 1. 17: which swallowed vp Ionas in the deepe sea, Ion. 2. 10 cast him out vpon the drie land: If a sheepe run from his fellowes, the shepheard sets his dogge after it, not to kill it, but bring it in againe, God deales with vs as a shepeheard with his sheepe, when we goe astray, pouerty, sicknesse, dearth, imprisonment, bondage, are his dogs which hee sendeth to bring vs againe to the sheepefolde, which done he cals in his dogs againe: Saint Paul saith, 2 Cor. 1. 10. he hath deliuered, doth deliuer, and will deliuer out of dangers, speaking of the time past, present and to come to assure vs that God who did giue doth giue, and will giue an entrance, did giue, doth giue, and will giue an issue, and is pre∣paring an issue while the crosse prepareth vs. Esa. 51. 71 Tribulation is called a cup to shew the measure of it, wee shall haue but a cup of affliction, and it shall passe from vs as the Act. 28. 3. viper which leapt vpon Pauls hand, leapt of againe. If any obiect and say, experience shewes the contrary, for we see many children of God can no sooner breath from one crosse, but they feele an other, & as though one of their troubles hatched another, a plurality and tot quot, like waues fall one on an others necke, neither is there an end of their euils before God put an end to their liues. The answer is this: the disposition of some children is such, that they are neuer well, but when they are vnder the rodde, whereas if others of a little better nature should but see it con∣tinually, they would be quite out of heart: wouldest thou haue thy father take away the rodde, and thou hast still a curst heart? wouldest thou haue the iudge cease from holding thee on the racke, and thou wilt not yet confesse thy faults? thou art full of corruption, and happely canst not bee well purged with a single clister, wilt thou blame the Phisition if continuing his medecine hee giue thee a stronger purgation? Thy fault is not
single, and wilt thou blame God if hee double or treble his stripes? he is not as a waspe, which hauing once stunge, stings no more, he stingeth yet more, But Ps. 78. 32 when Israell sinneth yet more, hee stingeth yet more: besides, if God smite the hard heart againe and againe many drops of remorse may be wrong from it, Nū. 20. 11 as the waters gushed out, when Moses smote the rocke twice, which came not forth, when he did but hold his rodde ouer it, know therefore that Gods promises of deliue∣rance from troubles, and so all temporall blessings are hypothe∣ticall, if they stand with his glory & our good, these two are as the hinges of a door to turn forward or backward the promise. The vse of this is in all our afflictions, to waite patiently vpon the Lord, and hope in him, to say with the sweet singer of Israell, o yet my soule keepeth silence vnto God, of him commeth my saluation. A man that wadeth through a strong streame, sets his eye Ps. 26. 1. steadily on the firme land, and is not dismaid because he sees the place of his arriuall, so Gods children patiently passe through an Ocean of troubles, when they lift vp their eyes, and marking Gods goodnesse, foresee their deliuerance, though it may bee as Abraham saw the day of Christ, a farre off: they suffer, but pa∣tience keepeth them from being ouercomme, they neuer sinke vnder the burden of their crosses, because they lay hand on Gods promise, and hold by his goodnesse. In Musicke we beare with changes and breathes, with pau∣ses and discords, because wee know the Musition will make all fall into a good concorde. We grudge not to go through a peece of foule way, if the way be afterward pleasant, and our iourney nigh at an end. If we may haue a ioyfull haruest, we are content with a wet spring, content to sow in teares, so wee may reape in ioy: therefore take vp the crosse, and though God adde still to the sardle, stand vp still, bee like the palme-tree inclinata resurgit, presse it downe with weight, yet mounting vp, in time it drawes it on high, be like the Bullrush, flectitur non frangitur vndis, the waues may bow, but not breake it, in misery shew foorth the fruit of patience, as spice sends foorth it sauour when it is beaten, and Camamile it sent when it is troden on, as the Rose yeelds sweete water when it is di∣stilled,
as the Grape doth yeeld it iuce when it commeth to the presse, hope euen against hope, vphold thy minde a∣gainst the rage of mayne afflictions, for let them bee like those of Israell, many in number great in weight, grieuous in circumstancec nay long in continuance as we thinke, yet in ve∣ry deed, a very little while, and they are all gone, and there∣fore resolue with Iob, Iob 14. 14. all the daies of thine appointed time to waite vntill thy change come. Againe, this that God bringeth out of bondage, and hauing pressed vs, refresheth vs, and looking on our tri∣bulation hath compassion on our gronings, must cause vs to giue thanks to God for his holy remembrance to sacrifice vnto him with the voyce of thankesgiuing, to binde the sacrifice with cords, euen vnto the hornes of the Altar, this vse would Moses haue the Israelites make of their deliue∣rance:q Deut. 6. 12. & 26. 10. Beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the land, &c. Three things Christ commended in the Samaritans; First, their readinesse to beleeue: Iohn disciples were hard of beliefe, and therefore he teacheth them both by words, Mat. 11. 3 Goe tell Iohn what yee haue heard, and by works, tell him what you haue seene: but he knew the woman of Samaria would beleeue him on his bare word Ioh. 4. 26 therefore he doth but tell her what he was, and that therefore she did aske him, and many other of rhe Samaritans not abiding to haue their minds suspended in vn∣certainties, but hating, doubting where they should be resolute beleued in him, many vpon the report of the woman, many moe because of his owne word. The second thing commended in them is their piety & com∣passion, for wheras Luc. 10. 31. the priest and Leuits passing by the woun∣ded man, did but gaze on him, Behold, but not consider, Lam. 1. 12. both which the holy Ghost aduised, the Samaritan looked vpon him, with the eye of the body, and looked into him with the eye of the minde, and as though he had as much grieued to see his di∣stresse, as if himselfe had felt some part of the misery, he is a di∣ligent seruant vnto him. The third thing is, the acknowledging of a benefit, for when the rest went away speeders not thankers, Ln. 17. 15 the Samari∣tan
when hee saw he was cleansed turned backe, and with a loud voice praised God, as there was in God the course and discent of his grace, so was there in him the recourse & tide of thankes∣giuing, God shewed his benefit to him by donation in clensing him, the Samaritan by declaration in praising him, Gods was a reall the Samaritans a verball shewing both patent, Gods was a voluntary kindnes to him, his a necessary duty to God, & therefore he will not hide his deliuerance in the earth, and con∣ceale a blessing in his bosome, he will not take without giuing, but his praysing God with a loud voice is a grace for grace, great thankes for a great cure, and a new song for a new salue, and this was the least recompence he did owe, & the greatest he could pay, and a sacrifice that pleased God better then a bul∣locke, which hath hornes and hoofes to powre riuers of pray∣ses out of his lips for a sea of Gods blessings vpon him, which clensed him from his leprofie, as well as the waters of Israell did Naaman, when he had washed in Iorden.y 2 King. 5 14. God would not saue his people Israell Ex. 23. 32 conuerse or enter any league with the Egyptians, the generall reason was this, lest they should bee plunged in their superstitions, but a spe∣ciall reason was, because he would haue them mindfull of their deliuerance out of Egypt, and from the house of bondage, which conuersing with them might cause them to forget: and there∣fore though a weake people, when other nations like vultu∣res seeke to prey vpon them, nay seeke aide of straingers, yea though they be bad yet this was not Esa. 30. 2 permitted to Israell, and for them to ioyne in league with the Egyptians, was as much Eze. 23 3 as if the whore should hunt after the whore-master, and commit fornication with him: God registers vs vpon his hand, that the remembrance of vs might bee alwaies present with him, and Ex. 13. 9. wee must register him vpon our hands, that the re∣membrance of him might be alwaies present with vs. The hea∣then hauing trauailed the seas, and escaped the danger, were wont in token of thanks to sacrifice part of their gaine, to that God which they supposed had deliuered them: Gen. 7. 2 More cleane then vncleane beasts were preserued in the Arke: Gen. 22. 12. 13. Abraham spyeth a Ram behind him caught him by the hornes in a bush after the Angell had said, lay not thine hand vpon the childe, Mo∣sesf Ex. 10. 9.
said vnto Pharaoh f wee will goe with our sheepe, and with our cat∣tle: all this was done, that there might be sacrifices of thanks∣giuing at hand to offer to God, for escaping the danger of the floud, for his mercy comming inter pontem & fontem, betwixt the bridge and the brooke, inter gladium & ingulum, betwixt the knife and the throate: when Abraham lifted vp his hand to haue killed his sonne, for escaping the cruelty of Pharaoh, when they were brought out of the land of Ham, and once a yeere, and that was in september, Leu. 23. 42. the Israelits must dwell in tents seuen daies, that they might better remember their preseruation in the wildernesse. But the Prophet Mulachie may charge vs as well, as hee did the Iewes, both with the forgetfulnesse of our owne sinnes, for they said, Mar. 1. 6. & 2. 17. & 3. 8. 13. Wherein haue wee blasphemed thee? i Wherein haue wee wearied thee? k Wherein haue wee spoyled thee? l What haue wee spoken against thee?) as also of Gods bles∣sings, for they said, Mal. 1. 2. Wherein hast thou loued vs? Wee are like Lts daughters, who quickly put out of their mind, as well their owne deliuerance, as the destruction of Sodome, and when they were gone with their father from Zoar to the mountaine, Gen. 19. 33. committed such incest, as they might seeme to haue beene carried to a land, where all things were forgot∣ten: In this wee resemble Abraham, who said the second time of his wife, Gē. 20. 2. shee was his sister, as though hee neuer remembred Gods former punishent vpon Pharaoh, or his owne deliuerance from danger: Surely saith Iacob, God is inp Gen. 28. 16. this place, and I was not aware, and God is among vs, and many times takes away his hand from vs, whereas hee did hold our noses to the grind-stone, and wee are not aware, we thinke not of it: in extremities wee vow and promise faire, but being deliuered, wee forget the griefe of our misery, and comfort of our deliuerance: Gods blessings goe round about earthly men, and they are no more moued then the earth, which hath the circumference carried about it, and it selfe standeth still: giue mee leaue to instance in two par∣ticular deliuerances, one of the body, another of the soule, first from the gunpouder treason, though a match should haue gone to the working of it, yet a treason matchlesse for exam∣ple
for it is of the first impression, neuer before seene or al∣lowed, nameles for vglynes, or at least it hath no name adaquatum, sufficient to expresse it, the name of Legion comes nearest to it, Mar. 5. 9. it had in it so many murderous spirits, which cared not though their friends did fall so as their foes might dye withall. Which regarded not either safety of the King, or of the Coun∣trey, of the Queene, or of the Prince, but would haue swept a∣way both Moses, and Aaron, Prelate and Potentate, Priest, and people, high and low, one with another, haue killed the young ones with the damme, and haue made Acheldama a field of bloud both of Church and common wealth. But when the proud did thus rise vp against vs, and the assemblies of wicked men did seeke after our soules, 2 Cor. 1. 9. 10. when wee receiued as the Apostle speaketh of his owne dangers the sentence of death, then God, who raiseth the dead, deliuered vs from so great a death, kept all our bones, that not one of them was broken: he to whom the shieldes of the world belong couered vs, and with his fauour compassed vs as with a shield, he, who standeth about his people as the mountaines stand about Ieru∣salem, deliuered our soules from the lowest graue, as for those traytors which willingly drew to sinne, against their will were drawne to payne, God was terrible out of his holy places, they did drinke of the wrath of the King, and of the the state, which brought them to naught, as the rockes repell, breake, and consume into froath the boysterous waues, which beate against them conantia frangere frangunt; so let thine ene∣mies perish O Lord, but they that loue thy name, let them be as the Sunne, when it riseth in its might, and let the land haue peace Nestrs yeares. As Iob spake of his words, so say I of this great worke of Iob. 19. 24. God in preseruing vs? Oh that it were written, oh that it were writ∣ten, euen in a booke, and grauen with an yron pen, in leade or in stone for euer, that it might be a signe vnto vs vpon our hands, and a remembrance betweene our eyes, that it might be bound vpon the heart and goe downe into the bowels of the belly, but it is almost forgotten as a dead man out of minde, buryed in obliuion as Christ was buryed in the
earth, and in very deede we deale with all our preseruati∣ons. They are so many as Salomon did with the brasse of the Temple, 2 King. 7. 47. it was so much, he weighed it not, but if Moses will haue the Ex. 12. 42. Israelites, keepe the night holy in which they were brought out of Aegipt, and bids them Ex. 13. 3. remember that day in which they came out of the house of bondage, then remember and keepe holy the day of this deliuerance and say. This is the day which the Lord hath made we will reioyce and be glad in it: If you be silent, rowse vp one another with the fower lepers, which being deliuered from death, when they were in the middest of it, 2. Kin. 7 9 sayd one to another, this is a day of good tydings, we doe not well to hold our peace. Come to the deliuerance of the soule from the tyranny of Satan, the thraldome of finne, and the very gulfe of hell, for the diuell is a Pharaoh, the world is an Aegypt, subiection to Satan, is a bondage: but Christ is our Moses, who hauing con∣quered sinne, death, and hell, hath wrought our deliuerance: 1. Sam. 17 34. when Dauid the youngest sonne of Iesse kept sheepe, there came a Lyou and a Beare, and tooke a sheepe out of the flocke, but he went out after them, slue them both, and tooke away the sheepe though they rose against him: our Sauiour Christ not the youngest, but Rom. 8. 29. first begotten of his brethren is the true shepheard, who watcheth ouer his flocke Luc 2. 8. like the shepheard of Bethlem, there came a Loyn 1. Pet. 5. 8. that roaring Lyon, which go∣eth about seeking to deuour vs, and a Bears Pro. 28. 15. like that hungry beare in the Prouerbes of Salomon, and Dan. 7. 5. like that beare in Daniels vision which deuoured much flesh, and tooke not one sheepe but the whole flocke, but the shepheard following tooke them out of his mouth: As for the bondage and thral∣dome of sinne, by nature it reigneth in our mortall bodyes, it hath gotten such a iurisdiction ouer vs, as Iulius Caesar had ouer the Senate Perpetuam dictaturam we obey it in the lusts thereof, and fall from sinne to finne, as Gally slaues fall to rowing when they are fast chayned, but God who is aboue Nature rescueth vs from our oppressors, and wee that wee ser∣uants vnto sinne, getting the maistry, breake the yoake of iniquitie from our necke, we breake it bandes a sunder and cast away it cordes from vs, we withdraw our mindes from the
yoke and bondage of those naturall perturbations, that are in vs, God hath set our feete at large, and hauing broken the bounds of our yoke made vs goe vpright, sauing, hauing been long vsed to fetters, wee halt a little after they are taken from vs: and though wee beare about in our bodies the remnants of sinne, yet sinne doth not domineire, it is not so insolent against the spirit as it was, nor keepes it vnder with so strong a hand,Gen. 16. 5. 6. nor with the seruant Hagar any longer set it foote in the necke of her-mistresse, but is beaten out of doores, when shee begins to ouer-rule; Mat. 8. 9. wee are Centurions ouer our affections, and in all the regenerate, that is true, Gen. 25. 23. the elder shall serue the younger; for the flesh is subiect to grace though it pricketh, it is not vnto death, it doth not grow cankerous, it is not like the stinging of an Aspe, which, let Art or Nature diuise what plaisters it can to helpe it, is incu∣rable, for Christ hauing blunted the sting, it cannot enter into the inward parts of the soule to destroy it. 1 Sam. 18 6. If the daughters of Ierusalem, when Dauid returned from the warre and the slaughter of the Philistine, came out singing and dancing in token of ioy, and thankesgiuing for the victo∣ry; then let all true Christians, what little reckoning soeuer they haue heretofore made of freedome from spirituall ene∣mies, from their heart tell forth their deliuerance, and say with Paul, 1 Cor. 15 57. thankes bee to God, which hath giuen vs victory, through Iesus Chist our Lord; and no sooner mention with Paul their de∣liuerance from this present euill world and corrupt life with∣out Christ, but presently breaking out into the praise of God, say with him: Gal. 1. 4. 5 to him bee glory for euer and euer, Amen. Lastly, one vse more that God will haue the Israelites make of their deliuerance is this, to learne thereby to serue him, and be stirred vp to the obedience of his Law: when Ioshua had distilled this and other blessings of God vpon his people, the Quintessence that he wringeth out is this; Ios. 24. 14. ver. 17. 18. Feare the Lord and serue him, and in consideration of this freedome they giue their honest words to serue the Lord, and keeping touch are men of their words all the daies of Ioshua, and all the daies of the Elders that ouerliued Ioshua. The note is this. The more God doth free vs from misery, the more wee
should submit our selues to his will: but it fareth with vs, as with the snake, who being frozen lyeth quiet and still, but waxing warme stirreth and stingeth: Pharaoh so long as hee is vnder the crosse, will not haue Israell vnder his rodde, but promiseth their departure, but farewell paine, farewell pro∣mise; deliuerance makes him forget, what punishment promi∣sed. 2 King. 8 8. Benhadad King of Aram, in his sicknesse commanded Ely∣sha the Prophet to be honoured, 2 King. 6. 13. whom in his health he would haue killed, what was the cause that Ier. 48. 11 Moab was setled on the lees of their sinnes, but this; they liued at rest, and were not powred like other nations from vessell to vessell? The Moone the fuller it is, the further it is remoued from the Sun. The tree is neuer so much subiect to hurtfull winds, as when it blossometh, Segetem nimia sternit vbertas, Rami onere pra∣muntur: too much rancknes makes corne lye downe, boughes are broken with their owne burden. The horse too well cheri∣shed doth often cast his rider; Hos. 13. 6 as in their pastures; so was Israell filled, and when they were filled their heart was exalted, and Deut. 32. 15. when he waxed fat, he spurned with his heele, when hee was fat and grosse, and laden with fatnesse, hee forsooke God that made him, and regarded not the strong God of his saluation: when Nebucaduezar Deut. 4. 31. had been bound seuen yeers prentise to the crosse, he knew from whom his Kingdome came, and ho∣noured him that liueth for euer: in a word, aduersity can teach vs more of God and our selues in one weeke, then we can learn of prosperity all our life long. Man cannot manage a prospe∣rous estate, but if he be of great power he forgets God, if he a∣bounds in pleasure, he forgets himselfe, whereas God would haue our freedome from affliction, to be a hand to lead vs, and a foot to carry vs to the remembrance of him, and obedience to his law, that we might say, now thou hast set vs at liberty, we will run the way of thy commandements, and now thou hast set our feet in a large roome, as it is in Michas, Mic. 4. 5. we will walke in the name of the Lord our God for euer and euer. If Israell must, Gē. 5. 22. like Henoh walke with God, conforme themselues to the obedience of his law, and Gē. 6. 22. like Noah, doe according to all that he commandeth euen so doe, because hee deliuered them from ondage, which was grieuous to the bo∣dy, then must wee entertaine obedience, determine to keepe
his word, and by obseruing his will, get him honour, because he hath redeemed vs by Christ from the bondage of sin, which was grieuos to the soule, which went ouer our heads, and was like a sore burden, too heauy for vs to beare. This, as Saint Paul writeth to Titus, Tit. 2. 12. must teach vs to deny vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to liue soberly, righteous∣ly, and godly in this present world: this (as Luc. 1. 74 it is in the song of Zachary) was the end of our redemption, that wee should serue God without feare, in holinesse and righteousnesse, all the daies of our life.
AN EXPOSITION Of the ten Commandements. COncerning the tenne Commandements, this is generall to them all▪ euery one hath an Iniunction and a Prohibition: that which enioyneth vs to any vertue, for∣biddeth the contrary vice: that which forbiddeth any vice, enioyneth the con∣trary vertue: The first fiue haue speci∣all reasons annexed to them, to bind vs to obedience: the first foure make the first Table, and compre∣hend that duty wee owe vnto God, of which, The first Commandement containeth the inward worship of God, in these words; Exod. 20. 3. Thou shalt haue no other Gods before mee. The Iniunction, Thou shalt haue one God. The Prohibition, Thou shalt haue but one. THe reason in these words, Before mee: as if the Lord should say, the seruice which I will and require by vertue of this precept, resteth in the soule, you may dissemble with men, you may set vp Idols in your heart, and conceale it from them, for I haue walled in the heart, and mans eyes cannot be let into it: but deceiue not your selues, see you doe it not, for I know the Anatomy of the heart, and can gage the very bot∣tome of the thoughts: your doings are not behind my backe,
but before mee, before my face, in my sight, I am all eye, all hand, all eare, all foot, I see, worke, heare all, and am euery where, I view all things as one, and each one thing as all, being whole together without diuision, change, or abatement. Thus you see the streames into which this fountaine diuides it selfe, now come to the waters and drinke, raste of euery one as they pre∣sent themselues in order to your view. Wee must haue one God, and he must be Dauids God, Ps. 31. 14 I said vnto the, e Lord, thou art my God: this God shall be our God vnto death: therfore we must 1. loue him aboue all, 2. feare him a∣boue all, 3. trust in him aboue all, for whatsoeuer we loue feare or trust in most, that is a god to vs; for the first, loue him aboue all, our Sauiour Christ said vnto Peter three seuerall times, Ioh. 21. 13. Si∣mon Ioanna, louest thou mee, that his three-folde confession might wipe away the shame of his three-fold deniall, or as Ber∣nardc Mat. 26. 70. saith, to teach thee that thou must loue God plus quam tuos, tua, te, more then thy kinred, more then thy substance, more then thy selfe. 1. More then thy kinred: Great is the loue of children towards their parents, it was a strange thing, that Sarah Gen. 18. 11. old Sarah when it ceased to be with her after the manner of women & 21. 7. should giue children sucke, it was as strange that a childe should giue sucke to the parents, yet Moses witnesseth the one, & the French Academy reports the other; for when a father was condemned to die of famine, his daughter gaue him sucke with her owne breasts, which being made known to the Magistrates, she obtai∣ned pardon for her fathers life: here was loue, much like the na∣turall loue of the Storke, which feeds the dam when shee is old, because the dam did feed her when she was young: greater is the loue of parents towards their children, magis discendit quā ascen∣dit amor, of the children the Poet said, filius ante diē patrios inquirit in annos; but the parents praied & offred to the gods to preserue their children, that they might ouer liue them, & therfore called superstitiosi: the child is many times sicke of the father, and weeps because his father liues so long, whereas the father is ready to dye, for sorrow that his child doth dye so soone. When Iacob supposed verily that his sonne Ioseph was dead, he would not be comforted; but said, Gen. 37 35. surely I will goe downe into the grane vnto my sonne mourning, and Dauid shewing his fatherly affection,
when hee heard of the death of Absolon, wept as hee went, and thus hee said; 2 Sam. 18 33. O my sonne Absolon, my sonne, my sonne Absolon, would God I had died for thee, o Absolon my sonne, my sonne: but this notwithstanding, if our parents, if our chil∣dren stand betwixt vs and our God, wee must not regard them, nay in this case our holy carelesnesse must make them our footsteps. God is loue, and he that dwelleth in loue dwelleth in God, and God in him; yet loue it selfe speakes of hate in this respect, and exhorts it: Ln. 14. 26 If any man come to me, & hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, hee can not be my disciple: in this case odium in suos is pietas in Deum, and if they lye in his way, as he is going to God, he must tread and tram∣ple them vnder his feet, & for loue vnto God forget his blood, as Gen. 29. 18. Iacob forsooke his kinred, for loue he had vnto Rachell. This serueth to reproue the father, which maketh a God of his child, as father Hely did, he himself was a good man, but his children of disposition vnlike himself, the white Halciones hatch black young ones, & Esa. 5. 2. the vine in Esay brings forth wild grapes: these children were young twigs, that liked not vnder the old tree, weeds that waxed out of measure noysome, and fruit vpon which a bad aire falling, it did quicklie rotte, and fall from the tree; and because their cockering father doting on them, gaue them but light admonition for heauy sins, and smalll 1. Sam. 2. 23. 24. 29. rebuke for great offences, (Why doe you such things? for of all this people I heare euill reports of you: doe no more my sonnes, for it is no good report I heare) hee is said to honour his children more then God: on the other side, it serueth to reproue the child which maketh a god of his father, Elisha was somewhat faulty this way, who being too much wedded to his parents, would first go 1 King. 19. 20. kisse his father and mother, when he was called to the seruice of God: more blameable was that disciple, who be∣ing called to follow Christ, would stay, till his father was dead; Mat. 8. 21 Master suffer me first to goe and bury my father: when the mat∣ter respecteth faith and religion, and seruing of God; Mat. 23. 9 call no man your father vpon earth, (which should haue superiority ouer your faith, or hinder you when God calleth) for there is but one, your Father which is in heauen. 2. Loue God plus quam tua, more then thy substance: we may
roue a riches, but God must bee our standing marke: Crates, otherwise a wise man, in this was reckoned but a Philosophi∣call foole, to throw his mony into the sea, with these words, Ego te mergam, ne mergar à te, I will drowne thee, lest thou shouldest drowne mee. The Cappuchines are but Hypocrites, who neither take nor touch siluer, but start backe when it is offered as Ex. 4. 3. Moses did from his rodde, when it was turned to a serpent: the prodigall man is blame-worthy, who comming to his wealth before he comes to his wits, runneth beyond his pale, and liuing without compasse, maketh his owne hands his executors, and his owne eyes his ouerseers; supposing he onely knoweth the value of the world, and that others ouerprise it: wee may haue riches, as the Egyptians had their bondmen for vse onely, and vse them as trauellers doe their third legge, to helpe them along to their iourneies end: but the immoderate loue of them must be left to the heathen, which know no other heauen: os homini sublime dedit, whereas other creatures looke downewards to the ground, God hath giuen man a contrary countenance, that hee might looke vp vnto him, and hath placed the earth vnder his feet, to teach him, hee must not set his heart vpon it: his chiefe affection must not be set on goods, but God who giueth them: God is the true Bread, goods as the crums that fall vnder the table, God as an habitation to rest in, goods as a thorow-fae to passe by; mony is a prisoner, wee keepe it vnder locke and key, let it not be lord ouer vs, make it out master, we condemne our selues to our owne; gallies make it our God, (Col. 3. 5. couetous∣nesse is idolatry) we set vp an idoll in our hearts. Phil. 3. 8. Paul esteemed all things as dung to win Christ, esteeme not wee lightly of God to win all things besides. Mat. 19. 27. The Disci∣ples forsooke all things and followed him, doe not we forsake him, and follow all things besides: lose God for gaine wee lose a golden hooke for a silly fish. Weigh God lighter then the world, wee are deceitfull vp∣on the ballance: let wealth seeme better in our sight then God from whom it comes, 1 Sam. 11 2. Nahash putteth out our right eyes, and bringeth shame vpon vs. Loue the world better then wee loue God, wee loue an harlot better then our owne spouse; and therefore as Hosea
aduiseth Israell, wee Hos. 2. 2. must take away our adulteries from be∣tweene our breasts. This serueth to reproue those which make gold their hope, and say to the wedge of gold, thou art my confidence, who set vp a new God for the old vpstart Mammon for the Anci∣ent of daies, as treason set vp a new King 2 Sam. 16. 8. Absolon, for old King Dauid: which make the world bird-lime, with which they so belime their affections, that they cannot ascend vpward, who hang their gold on their soules, which like the weights of a clocke, drawes them to the earth, which no Alchimist can draw out of their hearts, though it may be abstracted out of the earth; who for loue of gold, bury it, though euen then they haue themselues one foote in the graue, who are Ps. 76. 5. viri diuitiarum, men friches, not possessors of them as lords, but possessed of them as seruants; who contrary to this commandement, doe greatest homage to that, which should bee their basest drudge: such are those stall-fed beasts in the Gospell, which are so Luc. 14. 18. yo∣ked to their oxen, and harnessed to their farmes, that being sent for, will not come to the supper, they are fettered with the things of this life, and so manacled, they entertaine this World as a Queene, and let it so rule in their hearts, that the messenger may goe as he came, and might haue had better thanks to haue held his peace; such a one was the young man, forward at first, as though he would haue been a disciple of Christ, but when it comes to poenam damni, that hee must lose some thing, that there must bee a parting blow betwixt him and his riches, then hee takes his vltimum vale, Mat. 19. 22. and goes away sorrowfull, that (as the Disciples said of another thing) was Ioh. 6. 60 a hard saying, he could not indure it: such a one was Demas, 2 Tim. 4. 10. who to embrace this present world, bids Paul adieu: but loue God as this commandement enioyneth, taste and see how sweet he is, earthly things as playn dishes will be vnplea∣sant to vs; let heauen become our obiect, the earth will be∣come our abiect; long we after the water of life, wee little re∣gard the water at Iacobs well, oh 4 28 but with the woman of Sama∣ria, downe goes the pitcher, Mat. 14. 51. with the young man, away goes clothing, Mat. 4. 20 22. with the disciples, away goes ship and nets, the loue of them, though not the vse; wee will not linger about earthly vanities, we will not beat our braines and weary our
selues in pursuit of the chase of this world, superfluous desire of hauing, shall not gnaue our hearts, these glowing vanities shall not sticke so fast vnto vs, wee will not thirst after them, to get them with the losse of the loue of God, and with the salue of our owne soules. Or loue God plus quam tua, more then thy delights and pleasures, Ioh. 2. 16 this followes the loue of the world: where the world is our God, our deuotion is pleasure and delight, whenh Mat. 4. 8. Satan the subtile sophister would bring our Sauiour Christ to an absurd conclusion, he presseth both the premises together, diui∣tias & delitias, hee should haue Power and glory, the world & the pleasures which it did affoord, not but that there are iust delights, which haue their warrants and their tearmes, and therefore as one being asked, whether a wise man might not eate sweet & delicate meate, answered, yes, except God made bees onely for fooles; so if it were asked, whether a good man may not vse pleasures, it may be answered, yes, except God made the choise commodities of the earth onely for the wic∣ked: I will instance but in one kind of pleasure, which we call pastime or recreation. There are as well generous delights as ingenius studies, and one of them must giue sweetnesse to the other, diuers while they haue been so precise, that they haue thought they might not delight in any sport, at last haue been so out of heart, that they delighted nothing: but be acquainted with the quality, let not sports be base, let them not be lawles, draw not occasion of delight from such pastimes, as we should draw occasion of repentance, thinke not the time well spent, when we refresh our selues in setting creatures together by the eares, sith this was bred by mans fall, by our owne fault. Be acquainted with the measure, bend a bow too much, it will breake, lose it too much, it will be a slugge, bend the mind, but doe not breake it, slake it, but do not loosen it: Bee acquainted with the due and lawfull times, make not play an occupation, let it neither be a vocation (for God would haue man labour in Paradise, and he said, fast and pray, not feast and play) nor yet an auocation from God: Lastly Be acquainted with good carriage in it, on the one side let it be as voide of rage, as full of relaxation, fall not out with heauen, if thou art crost with an vnseasonable showre, as though God did thee wrong, if hee
did not shine at thine appointed time, on the other side, ioy not to much, if thou beholdest the Sunne when it shineth in his brightnes: for by this ouer much delight, thou makest a god of thy recreation, these be lists and landmarkes, within which we must bound the procession of our sports, and in the licence of our desires wee must not remoue, wee must not ouergoe them. 3 Loue God Plus quam te, more then thy selfe. First, more then thy belly to pamper it, or Secondly, more then thy life to saue it. Wee are detters to the flesh, to prouide things neces∣sariei Rom. 8. 12 for it, but not to liue after it: Mat. 6. 34 He that will not haue vs carefull will not haue vs carelesse: It is a vertue to haue a care of the body, their is one extreame in defect, when pinching and sparing Col. 2. 23. we haue it in no estimation to satisfie the neede there∣of, an other in excesse, when Rom. 13. 14. we make prouision for the flesh to satisfie the lust of it. On the one side we must not so weaken our bodyes, that we become vnprofitable, and not able to doe seruice in Church or common-wealth, on the other side not so pamper our paunches, not so barrell vp Gods Creatures in our bellyes, not so mast our selues like Hogges of Epicures heard, that we may saue to doe seruice onely to our bellyes. On the one side we must not be caught vp in a whirlepoole, touch not, tast not, nor on the other side sincke in a quickesand, 1 Cor. 15. 32. let vs eate and drinke for to morrow we shall die: on the on side, we must prouide that our teeth be not cleane and white for want of foode; on the other side take heede they be not furred with excesse: This flesh of ours is ill inclined, keepe it vnder that it may be obedient to the spirit abstinence is a certaine brime and pickle, to preserue it, that wormes and stench doe not breede in it, but pinch it not to much for then we wrong the body, glut it not to much for then we pine the soule; In a word if our kitchin be our shrine, if our cooke be our Priest, if our Table be our AlterPhil. 3. 19. if our belley be our god as the Apostle speaketh, then transgresse we this Commandement, which forbiddeth vs to haue any more then one god. This serueth to reprooue those which make their belly an Idoll, which by nature is a place of excrements: The bruit
beasts take onely that foode, which Nature requireth for their maintenance, euen the Lyon, which of all beastes is most raue∣nous and greedy of prey, whose appetite cannot be stanched, without great superfluitie of nourishment, contents himselfe for two or three dayes, after he hath once satisfied himselfe; to blame were the Agrigentines, who builded, as though they should liue euer, did eate, as though they should euer dye: to blame was Philoxenus, who (as Catullus wished all his body were nose, that he might spend all his time in sweete smelles,) wished he had a necke as long as a Crane that he might take more de∣light in meates and drinkes: to blame was that monster of the world Heliogabolus, who was serued at one supper with 60. Ostriches, and neuer serued two dayes with one kinde of meate, who neare the sea neuer vsed fish, far from the sea, nothing but fish: to blame are all Epicures, whose senses are their guides, and Purueyors, whose appetites are their stewardes who stuffe, themselues like wooll-packes, who, whereas they should bee like Antes, and Bees, the wisest creatures, and abound rather in pectore vbi est animus, quam in ventre vbi est stercus, resemble Philo∣poemenes Army, which had neither head, nor feete, but whole belley, and being like the Locusts which hath but one gutt, haue al their body in belly, whose bellyes may be sayd rich, for they haue great comminges in, whose throates are open Sepul∣chers, for the fat morsells and gobbets, which they ury in their stomackes more then nature requireth, doe there rotte, putrifie and stinke, as dead carcases in the graue, who making but one meale a day, begin early in the morning and holde out till late in the night, who cramme their bellyes, and fat them∣selues like boares, till they be brawned, and haue as Elyphaz, speaketh Iob. 15. 2 collopes in their flankes: If the Pagans were to blame which made them gods of Siluer, gods of Golde, gods of Marble, then how blame-worthy are they, which hauing a greedy gutt, a sweete tooth, and veluet mouth, make their best beloued god shew holy, sacrifising vnto it whatsoeuer they can rap and rend, and whereas they should be filled, with the Holy Ghost, farce their bodyes though they starue their soules, and if they follow Christ, they doe it as they in the Gos∣pell Ioh. 6. 26. more for loaues then for loue. Or loue God Plus quam te, more then thy life: Our liues are
neare and deare vnto vs, herein the diuell who was a lyer from the beginning sayd truely, Iob. 6. 26 skin for skin, and all that a man hath will be giue for his life: & though the desperate man many times weary out his life dyes a dogges death, making his own hands his executioners, though better men then he, lying sicke vpon their bed in extremity of their payne, haue intreated death to release them though some malefactors laughing on their hang∣man iest away their last breath, yet naturally we shrinke at the thought of dissolued, and would turne our backes when death shewes vs his face. The Papists in time of ignorance were content to be at cost to set vp Idolatry, happely with theEx. 32. 3. Israelites, they would not spare their earings, and 1 Kin. 18. 19. with Iezabell would harbour a crue of trencher Chaplaynes for the seruice of Baall, againe in their blinde zeale would macerate their bodyes, whipp themselues, goe in sackcloath, and fast till they were as hungry as a Church∣mouse, but I neuer read of any that went so farre as the Pro∣phets of Baall. 1 Kin. 18. 28. to cut themselues with Knues, and Launces, till the bloud gusht out vpon them, but yet more then that, vt serues vitam, ferrum patieris et ignem. Men will be content to be launced, yea and seared to, for the preseruarion of their liues: bondage is bitterEx. 2. 23. the childrē of Israell sighed, & cryed, & made a mone for their seruitude, but when they thought their freedome would cost them their liues in the wildernes, they wish they had endured it, & the Gibenites thinke they haue great fauour shewed them of the Israelites, if they spare their liues, though they make them bondmen Ios. 9. 23. hew∣ers of wood, and drawers of water, for the house of the Lord, for the vse of the Tabernacle, and Temple, when it should be builded. A man is hardly brought to alter his religion he mak∣eth such a league with it as Elisha with Elyas, 2 Kin. 2. 2 I will not leaue thee, he will not reele from faith to faith like a drunken man from post to piller, or as an vnskilfull builder misliking his owne doings, he will not be still pulling downe, that he is still setting vp, on the one side Constantine will not consent to haue images, though therefore his mother Irene, takes him and pulles out his eyes, he tryeth the spirits, and retayning the good in a resolute courage throweth Iezabell out at the window: On the other side that holy man (for so they call him) in the 2. counsell of
Nice will not leaue worshipping of our Lady though, if he will doe it, the diuell promiseth by his honesty, hee will no longer tempt or trouble him: yet all this notwithstanding Ios. 9. 9. idolaters in Ioshua to saue their liues, pretend to honour God and receiue his religion: but if death & all the torments which can be deuised should stand betwixt vs and our God in our iourney to heauen, this Commandement enioyneth vs to passe them all, rather then giue ouer our loue vnto God, for whose sake Esay is content to be killed with a Sawe, Ieremie with stones, Amos with an yron barre, Daniell to be throwne into the Lyons den, these were but Originalls, there followed Coun∣terpaines which agreed with them, Ignatius, Polycarpus, Irenaeus, and others suffered not death without a Copy, without an ex∣ample, Paul was content to lose his head, Bartholomew his skin, Luke to be hanged on an Olyue-tree, Steuen to be vnder a heape of many stones, and as our Sauiour Christ sayd to Peter and Andrew Mat. 4. 19 follow mee, so they followed him (though not Passibus aequis) in his life though not with like innocency, in his death though not with like constancy, these pledged their pre∣decessors in the cup of afflictions, and began to their successors, and amongst other to our English Martyres, who in this time of Queene Mary did sticke ad iguem, and to shew they loued God more then their liues were content to goe to him, with Elias in a fiery chariot, not doubting but that same mantle, that same body, which they should leaue behinde them, should at the resurrection of the iust be restored in a more Glorious sort: the former Martyres stood in the forefront of the battayle, and therefore 2 Sam. 11. 15. like Vriah receiued the first in counter & violence of their enemies, the latter like old beaten souldiers won the field in the rereward▪ all of them, when they could not go the white way to God in time of peace to shew they preferred Gods loue before their owne liues, were content to goe the red way in time of persecution. This serueth to reproue those, which can bee contented to follow Christ in a calme, but being Mat. 8. 27 vnlike the disciples, will giue him ouer in a troublesome sea: who are forward at first, but if they perceiue they shall be prickt for martyres, shrinke backe as snailes, which putting forth their hornes, being a little pricked pull them againe, who being crased vessels will
not hold, but breake in peeces when they come to the furnace, like the aples, which as men write, grow about Sodome and Gomorrah, pleasant to behold, buts vanishing into soote or smoke, as soone as a man put his teeth to them, or like the Christall which seemes a precious stone, till it comes to the ha∣mering, such are they, which forsake Christ, because they will not giue their flesh for him, as they in the Gospell Ioh. 6. 66 forsooke Christ, because hee said, he would giue his flesh for them, who when the sunne of tribulation scorcheth hot, are Mat. 13. 5. 6. like the seede, which fell vpon stony ground, which sprung vp, but when the sunn rose vp, parched, and for lacke of rooting with∣red away, vnlike the Egels young ones, who looke directly against the face of the sunne, and indure the perching beames thereof, whereby the Egle which carryeth them vp to make triall, whether they are naturall Egles or bastardly branches, acknowledgeth them as her owne, which otherwise shee would extrude out of her nest. Indeed Gods Church is made stockfish, and goes along by weeping crosse, Gē. 25. 22 Iacob cannot be quiet for Esay, no not in his mothers wombe, Mat. 2. 16 Herod turns his rage vpon the poore in∣fants of Bethlehem, when his malice cannot dispatch Christ himselfe. Luc. 13. 34. Our Sauiour compares himselfe to a Hen, and his Church vnto chickens, because Herod plaies the foxe, and lyes in waite for them. The Kites and birds of cruell kind deale hardly with the little, Mat 13. 32. which build their nests in the branches of the little mustard seed. Gen. 4 8. A thorne of his owne blood trou∣bles Abell. Ex. 2. 15. Phaaroh seeks for Moses to slay him. Ioh. 21. 18. Peter must bee bound, and led whither hee would not, in respect of flesh and blood, which is vnwilling to this sacrifice, not in respect of the inner man and of the spirit, Act. 5.  for he went away reioy∣cing when he was whipped: but when the persecutors tho∣rough their beastly crueltie and tyger-like tyranny haue sought to racke & rent the babes of Christs spouse, and like curdogs with their teeth to teare the lambs of Gods pasture, euen then life hath not been deere vnto the Saiuts, in respect of his loue. Reade we the Acts and Monuments of the Church, wee shall find, that Saunders tooke the stake whereunto he should be chained in his armes, and kissing it said; welcome the crosse of Christ, welcome euerlasting life, and being faste∣ned
to the stake and fier put to him, full sweetly he slept in the Lord: and Doctor Taylor, comming to the place of his execu∣tion, thanked God, that he was euen at home. Carolus, according to his name, was carelesse of his body in this respect, and thirsting after the cup of Martirdome, had it last filled vp to the hard brimme, Alas, saith he, I lie Ioh. 5. 5. like the lame man at the pooles side by Salomons porch, and euery man goes into the place of health before me, but God will ap∣point me one, one day to put me in, these and a thousand be∣sides. These were good grapes, and feared not the presse, were good gold, and feared not the fire, were good corne, and fea∣red not the flayle, or grindging of their bodies, with the teeth of the wilde beasts, they desired to hold life with Christ, and therefore feared not death for Christ, and if some of them thorough infirmity of the flesh, haue a little yeelded to their enemies, and stained their cheeks with blushes of recantation, yet like valiant souldiers after flying did againe fight, and not giue ouer the field, till they had finisht their course, reioycing, that the sentence of death did send them sooner to heauen, then the course of nature would haue done, and that their aduer∣faries did helpe them to euerlasting blisse, by their speedy dis∣patch. The next duty to loue, enioyned by this commandement is seare, Loue, and feare, are sweetely tempered together in the hearts of the faithfull, they loue God fearefully, they feare God louingly, whereas the vngodly feare him slauishly with∣out loue, and therefore are said to Iob 18. 14 goe to the King of feare. The godly know God to be a mercifull father, therefore they loue him, they know him to bee a powerfull Lord, therefore with Iob r they are strucken in feare to stand in awe of his Ma∣iesty,q Iob. 23. 15. Dauid makes a sweet coniunction of both: Psal. 5. 7. I will come vnto thee in the multitude of thy mercies, there is the first: and in feare will I worshippe towards thy holy temple, there is the second: Loue without feare makes vs presume, feare without loue makes vs dispaire, therefore as in God mercy and truth are met together, so in the godly, loue and feare doe kisse each other: by the first, they reioyce according to the ioy in haruest, as men reioyce, when they diuide a spoile, their mouth is filled
with laughter, and their tongues with ioy: in respect of the second they say with Iob, Iob 23. 15 I am troubled at his presence, and in considering it, I am affraid of him: In respect of both the Pro∣phet saith, Ps. 2. 11. serue the Lord with feare, and reioyce vnto him with re∣uerence: both concurre in the godly in their iourney to heauen, as they did in the woman Mat. 28. 8. who departed from the sepulchre, with feare and great ioy. Mat. 22. 7. The Scripture compareth God vnto a King, and Goran hath obserued foure things commendable in a King; the greatnesse of his power, the depth of his wisdome, the se∣uerity of his iustice, the serenity of his mercy: such a King is God▪ of great power, Quantus Deus est, qui deos facit? he is not shaken with feare, for  Sam. 1. 3 he is the Lord of hosts, he is not sedu∣ced by error, for he is wisdome it selfe, he is not corrupted with affection, for he is iustice it selfe, hee is not subuerted by fury, for he is mercy it selfe, accidents in others are essences in him: we must reuerence him for the first, heare him for the second, feare him for the third, and loue him for the fourth: In the Gospell the Mat. 25. 15. Talents are deliuered, the charge is giuen, the account is taken: The deliuery to one fiue, to another two, to another one, sheweth that God bestoweth gifts and graces on his seruants in seuerall measures, one shall haue an Ephah full, which containeth ten pottles, an other shall haue but an omer full, Ex. 16. 36 which is but the tenth part of the Ephah: The charge, occupie till I come, teacheth vs to vse those gifts and graces to Gods glory, and the benefit of his Church: the account, that he comes and reckones with them, foresheweth that hee will one day say to vs, as the rich man to his steward, Luc. 16. 2 Giue an ac∣count of thy stewarshippe: Wee must loue him, because as a good God he deliuers his talents, feare him, because as a iust iudge he will take an account: The Prophet Es. 8. 12. 1 3. Esay exhorting vs to this feare, doth first dehort vs from two sorts of feare, which hinder it. First, feare not those things which the wicked feae. Secondly, feare not the wicked themselues: and now I am entred into so large a field, that in it I may easily leese my selfe, but my speech shall drawe it selfe vp within some few of their feares, which my charity serues me to particularize. First, the wicked are brought in feare where no feare is, they frame to themselues feares out of their owne imaginati∣ons: and as Iud. 9. 36. Zebul said to Gaal, The shadow of the mountaines
seeme men vnto thee, so are they many times afraid of a shadow: which makes their hare to stand vpright, their bodies to shake, their hearts to throb, their senses to faile, and wits to faint, it is said of Antenor allied to Priamus King of Troy, that hee would either haue a target borne ouer his head, or close his coche on euery side, whensoeuer he went out of his house: he did feare as a sparrow out of Egypt, and as a doue out of the land of Ashur. Mar. 8. 24 The blind man in the Gospell, when hee be∣gan to recouer sight, thought trees to bee men: so it is writ∣ten of the Burgundians, that expecting a battle, they thought longe thistles were launces, their eye was a false glasse which did not represent things vnto them in their right proportion. God doth send a faintnesse into the hearts of the wicked, in the land of their enemies, Leu. 26. 36. and the sound of a leafe shaken, shall chase them, and they shall flie, as flying from a sword, and they shall fall, no man pursuing them, so that, as he saith in Mar∣tiall; Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare, Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te. I do not loue thee, but I cannot tell, why I doe not loue thee and as the malecontent Antipodes euer contradicting will not walke in the beatē path of the Church, yet cannot tell why they seeke by pathes, so those are brought in feare, yet cannot tell why they are afraid, in Arithmeticke of nothing comes nothing yet they feare where no feare is: What neede I speake of Car∣dinall Crescentius, who feared that, which indeed neuer was, nor neuer had any but a fancyed being, for while he was busie about writing letters to Rome against the Protestants, Act. 8. 2. as Saul was to haue letters written to Damascus, for persecuting the Christians, vpon a sudaine he did thinke verily, that the Di∣uell walking in his chamber, like a great masty curre, at last coucht vnder his table, and this conceit he did finde so vnspor∣table for waight, that let his friends comfort him what they might, his Phisitions counsell him what they could, in a me∣lancholy humour hee died comfortles. The superstitious man deserues not so much to bee spoken of, as to bee laughed at, with disdain, who intending to take his iourney for feare alters his minde. if he stumbleth at the threshold at his setting out of doors, who utending to take his dinner, for feare alters his
colour, if the salt fall towards him, and is as much afraid of that fall, as of the eleuation of a Comet, which hee thinketh alwaies to presage some fatall and finall ruine: if any of these fearefull or foolish conceits call at the goodmans doore, hee vseth them as passengers with slight respect, they shall not lodge with him, but away they shall, as Posts vpon the spurre. Another thing that the wicked feare is, the constellation of the starres, and as in time past they did attribute a certaine power to the planets, to worke in men good or bad effects, so at this day Astrologers make Calenders, which are full of good and bad aspects, Saturne they say, is a terrible, Venus a milde Planet, and so of the rest: and as they thought men and their af∣faires were gouerned by the Sunne, and Moone, and Starres, and influence of the heauens, and therefore called them, Ier. 44. 17 the Queene of heauen, and burnt incense vnto her, and powred out drinke offerings vnto her, supposing plenty and scarsity, health and sicknesse, weale and woe came by her: so doe the superstitious in our times following, Astrologers, which (are as Oecolampadius saith) the greatest of all Impostors (an Impostor is a Coniurer, Iuggler, or cony-catcher) worships these heauen∣ly bodyes, supposing mankinde is ruled by them, and there∣fore when they fall sicke, the starres are their counsellers they take their Calender, if they finde it an euill day, when their sicknesse began, their soule is powred out vpon them, they perswade themselues, that they shall not onely bee weakened, and sore broken, that their health shall passe away as a cloud, but that they shall goe the way of all the earth, that the graue shall be their house, and they shall make their bed in the darke, and the worme shall feele their sweetnesse, and therefore ma∣king their wils, take their leaue of all the world: but if it bee a good day, they doubt not, but all sicknesse shalbe taken away from them, health shall bee vnto their nauell, and marow to their bones, that their flesh shall bee as fresh as a childs, and returne as in the daies of their youth. But the Prophet Esay derideth such as these are, saying, Esay. 47. 13. Let now the Astrologers, the Starre-gasers, and Prognosticators stand vp and saue thee; not that he condemneth Astronomy, for it is good to know the course of the heauens, the rising and setting of the starres, Gē. 1. 14 which
God appointed to giue light, and to make difference of times and seasons, but vtterly disliketh Astrology, whereby men will vndertake to know things which are to come, and attri∣bute the operation in the elements to the starres, which be∣longeth to God, who made the starres, Ps. 147. 4 and calleth them all by their names, which serueth to no vse, but to delude the people, and contrary to this commandement, to bring them from depending onely on God. Wee must not feare this feare, and as our Sauiour Christ dehorting vs from carking care, saith, Mat. 6. 31 32. take no thought, saying, what shall wee eate, or what shall we drinke? or wherewith shall we bee clothed? vsing this argument, after all these things doe the Gentiles seeke, so the Lord in the prophecy of Ieremy, by the like reason dehorteth from this feare, saying, Ier. 10. 2. Learne not the way of the heathen, and be not affraid for the signes of heauen, though the heathen be afraid of such. Moreouer the wicked feare rumors, when it was noysed that there was borne Iesus King of the Iewes, Mat. 2. 2. 3. King Herod was troubled, and all Ierusalem with him: their hearts were mo∣ued as the trees of the forest by the winde, rottennesse entred into their bones, and they trembled in themselues: so Es. 7. 2. when it was told the house of Dauid, that Aram was ioyned with Ephra∣im, the soule of the King and his people was pressed downe, feare and trembling did come vpon them, an horrible feare did couer them. God hateth this feare, and therefore will haue his people, Ier. 51. 46 goe out of the midst of Babell, lest their hearts should faint, and they feare the rumor, should be heard in the land concerning the taking of Babell, for the newes came the first yeere, the siege came the second yeere, and it was taken in the third: and Ps. 112. 7. a good man will not bee afraid of any euill ti∣dings, for his heart is fixed, and beleeueth in the Lord: he is well grounded, and therefore like Mount Sion he cannot bee remo∣ued, but standeth fast for euer, the feare of God doth ballance his heart, and therefore hee floateth steadily, blowe what winde it will, he sailes to the porte. A fourth feare disliked, is feare of disgrace, which many times maketh not onely the wicked, but euen good men backward in performing their duty: this was one cause why Ionas was vnwilling to go to Niniuh, and preach vnto it the preaching that God bad him, Ion. 3. 3. Yet forty daies and Niniuh shalbe
uerthrowne; for he did not onely despaire of successe, being out of hope, that the children of Ashur would turne to the Lord, when the children of Israell would not repent; but feare of reproch did trouble him more, when considering there was in God Ion. 4. 2. great kindnesse, and Ps. 63. 3. louing kindnesse; which simples com∣pounded make great louing kindnesse in God, considering he was not onely of long suffering before hee inflicteth punish∣ment, but penitent in the stay and intermission of it; hee thought he should be counted a false prophet, that would bee a reprofe vnto him, he should bee a prouerbe and a common talke among the people, and therefore flyeth to Tarshis, say∣ing in effect with Moses, Ex. 4. 13. sende by the hand of him whom thou shouldest send. This feare of disgrace began to worke vpon Paul, when God called him to preach to the Gentiles, Act. 22. 1 They know, saith he, that I prisoned and beate in eery Synagogue them, that beleeued in thee: & now if I shall preach thee, whom before I per∣secuted, what will they say? they will say, that I weaue and vn∣weaue like Penelope, & being as variable in my practises as Pro∣teus in hs shapes, set vp one day, to pull downe another; that I am changed as the Moon, which neuer viewes vs twice with the same face: thus because he would not suffer contempt he seek∣eth couert, would stop Gods mouth vpon good termes, allead∣ging a plea, to put off the office which he was to execute. To come to our selues, I am perswaded that among vs many pa∣pists on the left hand, many schismatikes on the right hand (be∣twixt which two the Church & liturgy of the Church is cruci∣fied, Mat. 2. 38. as our Sauior Christ between the two malefactors) would be brought to the tabernacles of peace, and follow the truth in loue, where it not for this that they thinke, they should bee a reproach vnto their neighbours, a scorne and derision to them that are round about them, haue I been thus long a Recusant, thinkes some Papists, haue I thus many yeeres held these and these opinions, and shall I now staine my cheeks with the blushes of recantation, and not second my beginnings with sutable proceedings? shall a Retraxit be entred against me, as against the person plaintife, when he commeth into the court where his plea is, and saith he will not proceede? what will men say? they will say▪ that I am a wauering weathercoke, a reede shaken to and fro with the winde, that I am so light,
that I had need to haue lead tyed to my heeles, lest euery wind should blow me away, that I ebbe and flow, that I haue one mind sitting, another standing: in a word, this fact of mine will be so deepely died in Crimson, that time in all my time will neuer weare out the colour, in consideration hereof, he takes vnto him a whores fore-head (as it is in Ier. 3. 3. Ieremy) and will not blush, and & 8. 12. puts vpon him a brow of brasse, and will not be ashamed: Againe, on the other side, many a schismaticke would loue peace, as well as he seemes to loue truth, being an Hebrew, he would not smite an Hebrew, and counting it a miserable praise to be a witty disturber, would cast a good liking vpon receiued truthes, and returne to the bosome of the Church, like the doue to the Arke with leaues of Oliue in his mouth, were it not for this, what will men say? they will say, I am like the wind which continueth not long in one quarter, that following the common streame, I respect profit, that as the diuided tongues of the multitude agree not each with another, so I doe not agree with my selfe, I shalbe a by-word of the people, and as a tabret before them, I shalbe their song and their talke, my soule shalbe filled too full of the mocking of the wealthy, and despightfulnesse of the proud; such a blot of infamy wil be brought to my name, as neuer will be wiped out. In consideration hereof, hee holds on, his bones shall bee full with the sinnes of his youth, and hauing before published the priuate conecits hee had in his breast, will still continue to vent them by word or writing, to the disturbance of the common peace: but the feare of God must so take vp our hearts, and keepe such residence therein, that the feare of rebuke, reproch, and disgrace must not possesse them to dismay vs, according to that in Esay, Esay 51. 7 feare ye not the reproch of men: neither be ye afraide of their rebukes. But besides these, there are other two feares more trouble∣some then all the rest: the first is terrour of conscience, when the sinne of the wicked doth testifie to their faces, when God doth send his plagues vppon their hearts, and they knowing all the wickednes whereunto their hearts are priuie, see Gods iustice following them at the hard heeles, when recor∣ding with exceeding great griefe that which they did with ouer-great delight, their hearts ake and euery ioynt tremble,
when they feele sinne stirring in them as it were some liuing thing crawling in their bodyes, and gnawing vppon their hearts: This, this is the feare which when it hath taken pos∣session of the heart, excludeth the feare of God required by this commandement, this wringing, this torment, and gnaw∣ing of bad consciences that torment malefactors, are the onely three Faryes feyned by Poets to dwell in hell, and to be nayles in the heart, not but that a man may sinne, yet not haue a pre∣sent feeling of sinne: for hee may haue a spirituall Palsey, a numnesse, yea dumbnes of Conscience; conscience as a foule Glasse will not so soone represent his sinne vnto him, and hee being cordis sui fugitivus, dares not so much as view his filthy soule, but is like the Elephant, which seekes to drinke of pud∣dle water, lest that which is cleare might shew him his de∣formed face, quo peius se habet minus sentit, he is like a sicke man, who in his sleepe feeles not his paine, like one Dionisius into whose belly, though they thrust needles to let out his fat, yet by reason of his grossenes, he felt them not; like Maryners, who accustomed to the sea, perceiue not the stinke of it: He is dead, smite him, yet he feeles it not; he is naked, yet view him, hee is not ashamed; he is deafe, hammer on him, he answeres not, his conscience is of proofe, able to repell good admonitions, he hath long sucked poyson, and being nourished with it, now he perceiues it not: tell him of a reckoning, hee is so far in debt that hee will not giue it the hearing; bid him search his woundes, durus est hic serm, they are so deepe, he had rather suffer them to fester: admonish him to take a view of his life past, his eyes are at home in a box: hee hath made a couenant with death and hell, the diuell is at secret peace with him: hee will not heare his conscience when it would counsell him to be at peace with God, and at war with sin, if by crying lowd; for audience it growes troublesome, he is ready to endite it for a common barrettor, Gen. 4. 17. with Cayn hee can cast away care, with Gen 25. 34. Esau he can eate and drinke, rise vp and goe his way, but tranquillitas ista tempestas est▪ this calme continues not long with∣out a storme, Iob. 27. 20. fearefulnes shall ouertake him as a rape of waters, & 15. 24. and preuaile against him as a King ready to the battell: Conscience is a booke, and God hath giuen euery man one to carry in his bosome, which though hee be vnwilling to open, yet at last he
must needes vnclaspe it, it is a monitor, and at last it will complaine, it is a watch, and at last it will giue warning: it is our Domesticall Chaplaine, & wil not alwayes stop his mouth, bur cry out of the fullnes and foulenes of iniquitie, of the ripe∣nes and rottennes of sinne, let a man haue so large and able a gorge that he can swallow and digest sinne as the Estridge doth yon, and vpon digestion sleepe, and with Epimenides take a nappe of 47. yeares long, yet many times euen in sleeping, Conscience which he would restrayne and imprison will put him in minde of his sinne. Richard the third that vsurper, who to haue the Crowne set on his owne head, put his two innocent Nephewes to death, did thinke in his sleepe, he did see diuers images like torrible diuels pulling and haling at him, not suffering him to rest, he did take the sword, and did perish with the sword, at last 1 Kin.▪ 32. like Ioab because he smt two men more righteous then him, with the sword of his enemy, but at first like Goliah 1. Sam. 17 51. with a sword of his owne, with the stabbing and launcing of his owne heart, what an hell did he feele in himselfe; how did his guilty con∣science gall him, what an inward worme and fire did gnawe and burne his heart; what heart-bytings did sting him in spight of his teeth, when his thoughts afforded him not sleepe, whe his sleepe afforded him not rest? who woare out many wak∣ing houres, when a man would haue thought his senses had beene fettered in the bands of rest. The good man falles on sleepe with sweet Meditations, and sayth with Dauid l haue IPsa. 63. 7. not remembred thee in my bed? Therefore Pro. 3. 24 when he sleepeth he shall not be affraid, when he sleepeth, his sleepe shalbe sweete; but the wicked imagineth mischeife on his bed, Pro. 4. 16 he cannot sleepe except he hath done euill, his sleepe departeth, except he cause some to fall, therefore God will punish him on his bed, sleepe shall depart from his eyes, or if he suffer his eyes to sleepe, or his eye-lydes to slumber, or the temples of his head to take rest, if his senses be tyed vp, his sinnes are loose, and representing themselues vnto him in most vgly shape doe af∣fright him with hellish and terrible dreames, Esa. 57. 1. there is no peace to the wicked sayth my God▪ the trouble of his minde is not inferiour to the raging of the Ocean Sea: A seruant that is wearyed with ouer much worke can fly from his maister and be at rest,
but a seruant of sinne whither shall he fly, he carryes with him, a bad conscience whither soeuer he goeth, because whither so∣euer he goeth he cannot goe from himselfe, his friendes doe waite vpon him, are within him, and are as partes of himselfe when his soule departes from his body, his conscience will not depart from his soule, nor his sinne from his conscience. He that is deepely wrapped in vseries bands, can hardely sleep, therefore Octauian the Emperour commanded, that the pillow of a certaine souldier, which died in great dett should be bought for him, to whom when answer was made, that it was a base pillow and nothing worth: buy it notwithstanding saith hee, for it hath some vertue in it to cause sleepe, that he that was so so much indetted could sleepe vpon it, and therefore when cares come vpon me, I will lay it vnder my head. But what pillow can he quietly rest himselfe vpon, who is more intangled in his owne bandes then any can be in the Vsurers? he knowes his tongue, his handes and all the members of his body are bound to the good abearing, he knowes his soule is in body bound with them, he knowes he hath broken the good beha∣uiour when by lying, and killing, and stealing, and whoring, he hath broken out, he feares he shalbe taken vpon an execuu∣tion that it wilbe sayd to him, as to the rich man, Luc. 12. 20. they will fetch away thy soule from thee, hins ille lachrima now is he woun∣ded at the very heart, and strocke in a marueilous great feare of Gods heauy vengeance to be powred out vpon him, now is he like Es. 57. 20 the raging Sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast vp myre and dirt: now is he as a man lying in a portall, or neare vnto it, who can take no rest for any long season▪ by reason of commers and goers, in and out by it, or that are still knocking at it to haue it opened: his sinne lyeth at the doore of his heart, and when the fire of concupiscence hath consumed all the seruants of sinne the senses, the will, and affections, the conscience alone remain∣eth vnburned, and sayth as Iobes messenger Iob. 1. 6. I onely am escaped alone to tell thee: and if in the beginning his conscience doth not say to him as Peter to Christ, Mat. 16. 22. looke to thy selfe: if it be not as 1. Sam. 20. 20. Ionathans arrowes shot to giue warning, if this light be not borne before him that he doe not stumble vpon iniquitie, in the end it will follow him with Hue and cry, and when he hath finished his sinne, this light shalbe borne after him, and volens
hee shall looke vpon it, whether hee will or no: let him muffle his conscience for a time as Gen. 38. 15. Thamar muffled her face, let it goe meerely like the Winde-mill with the gale of selfe∣lking, yet at last he shalbe sure it will article against him, and set before him the things that he hath done. Cleopatra Queene of Egypt may sucke out the poyson of Aspes, left Augustus Csar should carry her to Rome in token of triumph, and so dye sleeping: but if Satan triumpheth ouer the wicked, who drinke iniquitie like water, and haue the poyson of Aspes vnder their lippes, they roare and cry like the swine, which thinkes hee is neuer taken but to be slaine; let them eate and drinke, and be mery, cheae themselues as though all the world were their minstrell. O how short is this Hillary Tearme, or in very deed, no Hillary Tearme at all, for euen in laughing the heart is sor∣rowfull, though no body knowes where the shooe wringes but he that weares it; this their iollity is but dissembled, like that of the theefe, who may set the best side outward, and reuell and sport, as though he tooke no thought, but he hath a sad re∣membrance, within he hath conscience to accuse him, memo∣ry to beare witnesse against him, reason to iudge, and feare to condemne him, without, a locke on the doore, boltes on his legges, a brand in his hand, and his necke in suspence; I deny not, but that the best men know their iniquitie, and their sinne is euer before them, but within a while, God doth make them heare of ioy and gladnes, that the bones which he had broken might reioyce: wickednesse is as Zac. 5. 8. a talent of lead, and the best men are pressed vnder it as a Cart is pressed that is full of sheaues; and though no element is burdenous in the proper place of the ele∣ment, for example, the water though it might annoy vs other∣wise, yet would not offend vs with burden, though we were in the bottome of it, but a small vessell full, taken from thence, and layd on our shoulders, would be heauy; so sinne, though it seemes not a burden in the will of man, wherein the region and element of sinne is, yet bring it from it house and home, con∣uent it before reason, examine it, see the plagues due to it, then shall we see the weight of it and say, Psa. 38. 4 my sinnes are gone ouer my head, and are like a sore burden, too heauy for me to beare: but though the good man doth thus labour and be heauy loden, yet within a while he repaireth to God, and Ioh. 13. 23. with the Disciple, whom Iesus
loued, leaueth, as it were in his masters bosome, and approcheth to God, as Act. 8. 29. Phillip to the Chariot that he might be eased, and is eased by drawing the circumference of Gods promises to the center of his heart. Dauid was the sweet singer of Israell, yet in his Psalmes we heare many notes which iarre vnpleasantly, and are quite out of tune, as, Psa. 38. 3 there is no rest in my bones by reason of my sinne; and 8. I haue roared for the very disquietnes of my heart: but God doth put Psa. 40. 3. a new song in his mouth, and there follow notes of a better sound, as this. Psa. 51. 8 Thou shalt make me heare of ioy and gladnes, that the bones which thou hast broken, may reioyce: Ion. 2. 4. I am cast away out of thy fight, saith Ionas, here Act. 20. 9 with Eutychus, you may take him vp dead: but I will looke againe toward thy holy Temple, here you may see him with Gen. 45. 27. Iacob to reuiue, Luc. 7. 15 with the young man to sit vp and speake; Mat. 9. 7. with the palsey man to arise & walke. Rom. 7. 24. O wretched man that I am, sayth Paul, herein consideration of his infirmitie setting vp sayles of discomfort, hee is ready to runne vpon dangerous shelues: but I thanke God thorough Iesus Christ our Lord, this is a breath of faith, which comming stopes his course, and standing as a rudder in the sentence, turnes it quite another way, but as for the vngodly, it is not so with them, when they hit vpon discord, they neuer fall into a good concord: when they fall, they fall away, Prolapsi, id est, prosus lapsi, they fall like the Elephant, who being downe, riseth not againe, 1. Sam. 4. 18. they fall backward with Heli and can haue no helpe of their hands, in a word, this feare and terrour of conscience, in the godly lasteth but for a time and they are deliuered from it, in the wicked it abideth alwayes and they are deuoured by it: to the one God giues the thred of grace to bring them out of the laberinth of a troubled mind: the sense of sinne sendes the other headlong, Mat. 8. 32 as the diuels the heard of swyne, to the lake of disperation, feare in the one Psa. 114. 3. like Iorden is driuen backe, in the other like 2. Kin. 5. 27. the leprosie of Gehezi it cleaeth fast for euer, of all feares, feare not this feare, it is most opposite to the true feare of God, which this Commandement requireth. Lastly the wicked feare death and that because they neuer feared God in their life, they carnally feare to dye, they hellishly feare to be dead, the in∣tollerable payne in the very act of dissolution causeth the first, the conceit that they shalbe euer dying causeth the second. A
good man lookes death in the face, and goeth out couragiously to meete it with a smile, and taking it by the hand before it taketh him, doth at once welcome and contemne it, he know∣eth that 1. Cor. 15 56. the sting of death is sinne, and that Christ hauing pul∣led it out calles it droane to it face; 1. Cor. 15 55. O death where is thy sting: and therefore he is like the Swan, which by a naturall instinct finisheth his life with ioy and singing. —vbi fata vocant, vdis abiectus in herbis Ad vada Maandri concinit albus olor. but to the wicked, it is a death to thinke vpon death, when they consider on the one side, what euill they haue done, and on the other side, what euill they shall suffer; on the one side, what bad stewards they haue been, on the other side, what recko∣ning they shall make at the audit: they cry loath to depart, and are still willing like slaues to be chained to their gallyes, and are as vnwilling to goe out of life as Gen. 19. 16. Lt out of Sodom, and and are pulled from the earth with more violence, then 1. Kin. 2. 28. Ioab from the hornes of the Alter. But if the feare of God possesseth our hearts, then are wee voyde and empty of this and all other base feares, according to the admonition of Esay, Esa. 8. 12 wee feare not the feare of the wicked. And secondly wee feare not the wicked men themselues according to that of our Sauiour Christ, Mat. 10. 28. feare not them that kill the body, & Iustinus Martyre sayd: the persecutors could only kil, they could not ill, much like that of Petus concerning Nero, occidere me potest, ldere vero non potest: they haue no more power ouer the soule, then Satan had ouer Iobs, and can hurt the soule no more, then he which cutteth a garment hurteth the body, for the body is the garment of the soule. Iacob Gen. 31. 3 when God bids him leaue Padan Aram, and goe againe to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan, hath a wolfe by the eares, which he can neither hold, nor let goe without danger: if he disobeyes, he hath God against him, if he obeyes, his brother Esau comes against him, but the feare of God as the stronger yron driues out the feare of man as the weaker naye. Gods Commandement is of more force to make him obey, then present perill to make him afrayd, he fear∣eth God more then man, whose life is in his breath, whose breath is in his nosthriles; Saint Laurence feared not his persecutors, who speake to the Emperour who caused
him to bee tormented on a fiery gridyron on this wise. This side is now rosted enough; turne vp O tyrant great: Assay whither rosted or raw, thou thinkest better meate. Apollonia feared not her persecutors, who for confessing the faith of Christ, had all her teeth pulled out of her head: (Here∣vpon I suppose it came that Apolline, was the Saint for the Tooth-ach) & when the Tyrant threatned to burne her, except she would blaspheame Christ, she breaking from the Officers willingly leapt into the fire. I commend her constant courage: but set no Rosemary branch vpon her fact, for when our Saui, our Christ sayth to Peter, Ioh. 21. 18. another shall binde thee and leade thee whither thou wouldest not, he teacheth, that wee must suffer of an∣other, not of our selues; we must not lay violent handes by no meanes vpon our owne bodyes. In latter times Latimer feared not his persecutors for—timr addidit alas, feare would force flight. But he hauing forewarning six houres before, that a Pursiuant, was comming downe to call him vp to London, there after examination to be clapt in the Towre, and con∣demned, was so far from flying, that in that time he prouided himselfe, that he might be ready to ride with the Messenger: all these knew that if they be blessed that dye in the Lord; then much more blessed are they that dye in the Lord; and for the Lord, they knew that Christ did forsake his father, heauen and all to come vnto them, & they would forsake their friends, earth & al to come vnto him. Their enemies being more weary in tor∣menting them, then they of the torments, which seemed▪ more harsh to the beholders then to themselues, who did endure them: they were not afraid though ten thousand of people did beset them round about, who could but kill the body, but they feared him who hauing killed the body was able to cast both body and soule into hell according to the charge which Christ giueth, Luc. 12. 5. feare him, which he doubleth, yea I say vnto you feare him, hammering vpon vs againe, and againe, because nay les the of∣tener they are smitten, the deeper they peirce. The last thing required by this commandement is to trust in God, which followeth the feare of God, as we see in Exo∣dus, Ex. 14. 31 the people feared the Lord, and beleeued the Lord: Abraham beleeued the Lord, when he promised him the land of Canaan, though he had not in it the bredth of a foote, his faith was as
sure as his sense, that which was to come many yeeres after was as present with him, as if he had taken liuery and season, and present possession. Hee beleeued God, when he promised to multiply his seed as the starres of heauen, when as yet he had no child, himselfe was strucken in yeeres; and his wife past child-bearing, though God, who is aboue nature, hauing giuen him a sonne: Gē. 22 bad him offer him vp for a burnt offring, he submitteth his reason to faith, not his faith vnto reason, hee beleeueth that which reason cannot comprehend. Iacob resting on Gods promise, with an heroicall minde declareth the land of Canaan to beed Gen. 49. his, whereas at most he had in it but a place of buriall, and that by intreaty, and lying sicke, but on a base couch, as though he had been some mighty Monarch; deuideth the land by will to his seuerall sonnes; hee beleeued that God who had pro∣mised, was able to performe, hee beleeued Gods prouidence, whereby he did foresee his power, whereby hee could effect, and therefore against all logicke hee holds the conclusion in spight of the premises. This serueth to reproue those which di∣strust Gods promises, which distrust his prouidence, which distrust hie power, for the first, Palaam the lyer was inforced to acknowledge that Num. 23. 19. God was true, and euery man a lyer, therefore the Psalmist compareth his words Ps. 12. 6. to siluer, seuen times fined, wherein is neither drosse nor superfluity, and saith, Ps. 62. 11 God spake once two things there are Power and Iudge∣ment in God, as if he should say, God needs not to repeate his words to giue assurance, as Pharohs dreame Gen. 41. 32. was doubled because it should surely come to passe, for if there were but one syllable of his truth, it were all one, as if there were a great volume: Iob therefore distrusting Gods faithfulnesse, speaketh as a man not well in his wits, when he would haue God Iob 17. 3. lay downe a gage, or put in a pledge or surety with him. Concerning his prouidence, as a man hath a care ouer his whole family generally, but more particularly ouer his wife and children; so God hath a care generally of all his crea∣tures, as creation was the mother to bring them forth, so his prouidence is the nurse to bring them vp; the first sets vp the frame of the house; the second keeps it in reparations; but hee hath an aspeciall care of the Church his spouse, his prouidence
houereth ouer it, Ex. 25. 20 as the wings of the Cherubins ouer the mercy seate, he sets his prouidence betweene it, & all hurts, that might oppresse it, as Ex. 14. 20 the pillar of the cloud was set betweene the hoasts, that no harme might befall vnto Israell. 2 Sā. 24. 1. Dauid therfore was to blame to number his people, as distrusting Gods proui∣dence, & trusting in the multitude of his strong men it: was not a fault to number the people, if it had bin Ex. 30. 12 towards the taxati∣on of the Tabernacle, Num. 1. 2 o for the warre; but to number them as Dauid did, either for curiosity to know, or vaine glory to boast, or for a distrust in Gods prouidence; this was it that brought in the plague. Concerning Gods power, Ex. 4. 3. Moses rod turned into a serpent, doth not speake, yet cryeth with a lowd voice, Luc. 18. 27. that which is impossible with man, is possible with God: who but hee could turne the Ioh. 2. 9. pots of water into wine? who but hee could Ex. 7. 19. turne riuers of water into bloud? Act. 12. 13 who but hee could plague one man by lyce and wormes? who Ex. 8. 17 but hee could plage all Egypt with these vermine? who but hee could Gen. 19. 11. blind one city? who but hee Ex. 10. 23 could blind all Egypt. Let no man doubt of his power, when he hath assurance of his will, to God nothing is wonderfull, because he knoweth all things, nothing impos∣sible, because hee can doe all things, nothing hard, because he can doe all things with his will, and therefore Iob 42. 2 Iob hauing spoken of his power, speaketh of his thoughts: as Caluin saith, to teach that his power and will are things inseparable, his mind and hand agre together, the one to determine, the other to bring to passe. Therefore the Israelites are to blame to distrust his might, Ps. 78. 19 can God prepare a table in the wildernes? but twice to blame, for that contrary to their owne experience, they limitted the holy one of Israell. Hee smote the stony rocke indeed, that the waters gushed out, and the streames ouerflowed, can he giue bread also, or prepare flesh for his people? How incredulous were they, when the re∣petition of former blessings could not breed an expectation of future hopes? hee shot somewhat neere the marke, that said, Rhetoricke was the art of perswading, for many times truth it selfe being deliuered by one that hath been slow of speach, slow of tongue and of vncircumcised lips, hath not had so much likelyhood of truth, as falshood hath had by meanes of good vtterance. A poore man complained to the King, that such a
man (naming a Lawyer) had taken away his Cow from him; I will heare (saith the King) what he will say to the matter, nay saith the poore man, if you heare him speake, then haue I surely lost my Cow indeed; he thought that smooth speach and cleanly carriage was as a golden chaine, which comming from the Lawyers tongue would fasten to the Kings eares, to per∣swade and leade him whither hee would. It is worthy the obseruation, what Socrates said before the Iudges in his owne defence, touching his accusers; my Lords (saith he) I know not how you haue been affected with mine accusers eloquence, while you heard them speake, for mine owne part, I assure you, that I, whom it toucheth most, was almost drawne to be∣leeue, that all they said, though against my selfe, was true, when they scarsely vttered one word of truth; but let Rheto∣ricke doe the best it can, no ornament can bee so good an ar∣gument as experience. Experience teacheth that, which Rhe∣toricke was neuer able to perswade, it teacheth by effect that, which wee neuer would comprehend by discourse, Ex. 7. 15. God bad Moses take his rodde with him, when hee should turne the riuer Nilus into bloud, that hereby remembring the former, he need not doubt, but God was able to worke an other mi∣racle. 1 Sam. 17. 34. Dauid gathereth strength to goe against Goliah, because he had experience of deliuerance from the Lyon and the Beare. Experience is a faithfull mans proofe, instances his remon∣strations, but the Iewes speake of Gods power by experience, they instance in what particular his power did appeare; yet chayne his hands, and curbe his might, as though he which had giuen them bread and water of affliction, could not as well giue them bread, as hee had done water for their consolation. The reason of all this distrust is, because wee stand reasoning with God, how shall this be done? thou foole wilt thou mea∣sure Gods power by that thou perceiuest, or make thy con∣clusion by the slender meanes thou seest. Iud. 1. 13 Othoniell for yeeres the youngest, for authority the least, for wealth the poorest of all his brethren, takes the City: 1 Cor. 1. 27. God hath chosen the weake things of the world to confounde the mighty: say not with Gideon, Iudg. 6. 15. 16. I am of a poore family, and secondly, I am the least in my fathers house, whereby then
shall I saue Israell out of the hands of the Midianites? I will be with thee, saith the Lord, Iud. 7. 20 and the sword of the Lord and of Gi∣deon goe together. Say not with Moses, Ex. 3. 11. & 4. 10. 11 who am I, that I should goe vnto Pharaoh? i I am not eloquent, neither at any time haue been; for who hath giuen the mouth to man, or who hath made the dumme to speake? but bee like Luc. 19. 4 Zachee who being low of stature, fulfilled the want of Nature by ascending vp∣ward. 1 Sam. 14 13. Ionathan, and his armour-bearer goe vp against the Phili∣stins, Ecce do gladij: what, but two swords against so many? satis est, it is enough; the weakenesse of God is stronger then men: A great multitude follow Christ, because they see his mi∣racles,m 1 Cor. 1 25. but where shall wee haue bread for such a multitude? Io. 6. 5. 9 there is a little boy here, which hath fiue barley loaues and two fishes, but what are they among so many? what, they are enough, and more then enough. God can make a little of the meanes to goe farre in operation, and cause Mat. 15: 34. & 14 17. &c. more baskets full to bee then taken vp, when hee doth feede the greater number with the fewer loaues and fewer fishes. Leuit. 26 26. hee that can breake the staffe of bread, that Hos 9. 2. the floore and wine presse shall not feed vs, euen Ps. 17. 14 hee can also fill our bellyes with his hid treasure: I speake not this, as though wee should neglect the meanes, for though Ps. 147. 9 God feedeth the young rauens that call on him, yet no ordinary feeding with∣out sowing, Mat. 6. 28 though God cloathe the lilly of the field, yet no ordinary cloathing without spinning. Man cannot helpe himself without God, God wil not ordinarily help man without himself: Rhahab is perswaded, that God will deliuer the spies that went to view Iericho from danger; but yet Ios. 2. 6. 16. she hideth them, and bids them goe to the mountaine and hide themselues three daies, lest the pursuers take them. Mardocheus and the Iewes rest on God but yet vse meanes for deliuerance, for after prayer Est. . 1. 2 hee hasteth to the Court: Act 27. 31 Paul will haue the Mariners cut the ropes and cast Ancres and yet knowes there shalbe no losse of any mans life, and in the great tempest when Ionas fled away from the presence of the Lord to preuent the ship wracke there is Ion. 1. 5. as well the labour of the Mariners in casting the wares out of the ship to lighten it, as their feruent prayers to saue it. As for those heretickes Bednini among the Saracens, which affirme that all things happen by desteny, and therefore goe to battell
vnarmed, saying, death cannot be eschewed, they and the like would be vsed as Zeno vsed his seruant, who when he alledged for himselfe, it was his desteny to steale, as though that should haue excused his theft, tolde his seruant, it was his desteny to be punished, and therefore he must expect no fauour: If we suf∣fer euill, we must as well looke to the iustice of God, who suf∣fereth, as to the malice of man, which offereth the wrong, else shall we be impatient, and byting the stone neglect him that threw it. So if we expect good, we must as well looke to the meanes to procure it, as to God who giueth it, else shall wee be terre invtile pondus, and by doing nothing come to nothing, as though we were very theeues to our owne estates. As on the one side we must not neglect the meanes, so on the other side we must not be to much tyed to them, for then contrary to this commandement, we make the meanes a god, as they which Hab. 1. 16 sacrifice to their net and burne Incense to their yarne: this was the fault of Israel, they trusted to much to the Egyptians to whom they vsed to fly in their dangers, which the Prophet disswadeth, saying, Esay. 31. 3 the Egyptians are men, and not God, Ier. 17. 5. cursing the man that puts his trust in man, for though they may Psa. 146. 3. be honorable as Princes, yet are they borne sinfull, sonnes of men, borne weake, there is no helpe in them, borne mortall, their breath departeth. Againe they trusted to much in Esay. 31. 1 Horses, but Psa. 33. 16 a Horse is a vaine thing to saue a man, neither can he deliuer any man by his great strength, and therefore when they repent Palinodiam Canunt, saying, Hos. 14. 4 Ashur shall not saue vs, neither will we ride vpon Horses, meaning they will leaue of all vaine trust and confi∣dence in Horse and man. Ioh. 4. 8. Our Sauiour Christ sendes his Disciples to buy meate, therefore vse meanes, Psa. 78. 30 but the Israelites dyed while the flesh was in their mouthes therefore fetter not the grace of God vnto it: 2. Kin. 20. 7. Esay will haue a lumpe of dry figges layd on Ezechias boyle to recouer him therefore vse meanes: but 2. Cro. 16 12. Asa dyeth for all the Phisitians that are about him, therefore trust not to much to meanes. Iob. 5. 7. Man is borne to labour, and God hath giuen him a hand, (which he hath not any beast) to worke withall, he hath giuen him vnderstanding to direct it, he will haue no ciphers in his Arithmeticke Mat. 20, 6. none standing idle in his Vineyard, to
get his liuing he will haue euery man sweat his browes, or sweat his braines, therefore vse meanes, but let a man weare his body out with violence, goe out vnto his worke vntill the euening, yea encroach vpon the night for time, and say with Ia∣cob, Gen. 31. 40. I was in the day consumed with heate, and with frost in the night, and my sleepe departed from mine eyes: yet Ps. 127. 2, except God blesse his labour he shall find it is but vaine to rise vp early, and to late take rest, therefore rely not on the meanes. In our owne profession, 1. Tim. 4. 13. 15. euery man to his study, Sermons must not come forth as vntimely fruit, from vncircumcised lippes, therefore vse meanes; but if God blesse not our studies, we may fish all day, Luc. 5. 5. as Peter fished all night, and take nothing, we cannot n the point aright, except God giue winde to our sayles, we shall be as barren and childles as Sarah. (I speake as Paul, 1. Cor. 4. 15. I haue begotten you in Christ Iesus) before God blessed her: All the Apostles tooke payne, but Act. 2. 46. it was God that added to the Church such as should be saued. God without secondary causes can worke what he list, The ruler saith, Ioh. 4. 49 Sir, goe downe before my sonne dye, is no greater then Marthaes, Ioh. 11. 21. Lord if thou hadst beene heere, my brother had not beene dead; greater is the faith of the Centurion, who beleeueth Dei dicere is facere Mat. 8. 8. maister, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come vn∣der my roofe: but speake the word only and my seruant shalbe healed. Greater the faith of the Leaper, who beleeueth that Gods will is a worke, Mat. 8. 2. maister if thou wilt thou canst make me cleane. In the booke of Genesis, Gen. 19. 22. haste thee, & saue thee in Zoar, I can doe nothing till thou be come thither: Non possum facere, not that it passeth his power, but that it is contrary to his nature, this impossibility proceedes not of infirmitie, but of might and Maiesty, for what he purposeth in his minde, he can effect and execute without let, without meanes: But meanes without God can neuer worke, therefore vse good meanes but rest not in them as in God, so rest on God, that our confidence in him doe not ex∣clude our taking paine, yet so take paine vpon trust in him, that our indeauours neuer be perplexed. Before me: A tyrants owne will goes for a law, without regard of right or reason: Sic volo, sic iubeo, stet pro ratione voluntas. When Constantius, would haue Paulinus, Lucifer, and other
Bishops subscribe against Athanasius, and communicate with the Arrianes, he yeelded no other reason but this; Quod ego v∣lo, pro Canone sit, doe as I bid you, or get you hence into ba∣nishment. Thus he made a stawking horse of his owne will, but in God (in whom things cannot be deuided, one from an∣other) righteousnes is linked with his will, when he sheweth his will, right is seene to goe with it; his word agrees with his intention, because he is truth, his worke with his word, because he is power: his will with his equitie, because he is right. When he sheweth his law, vnto Iacob his statute, and ordinance vnto Israell, reason is seene to goe with it: as in this place, see you haue no other Gods but me that brought you out of the land of Egipt, out of the house of bondage, for if you set vp an idol in your hearts, and sacrifice your soules vnto it, howsoeuer you may conceale this iniquitie from men, yet it is open and mani∣fest to me, who haue made a window into the heart; though I reserue it vnder locke and key for mine owne view. Before me: we doe good as before God, not caring who sees vs, wee doe good with a witnes, and wish it might be on re∣cord, but we doe ill as behinde God; for we hide and cloake our sinnes, and dawbe them ouer with some whorish com∣plexion, as our Gen. 3. 7. first parents with Fig-tree leaues did couer their nakednes. But Heb. 12. 29. God is a consuming fire and in his pre∣sence all couers, all false coloures, all Poppean paintinges of these pictes doe soone fall away, Io. 1. 2. the wickednes of the Niniuits comes vp before God: Eccl. 8. 13 they feared not before God, if our heart be not perfit with the Lord, but deuided, this wrong in parting his right among other is before God. 1. Cor. 2. 11. No man knoweth what is in man but the spirit of man that is in him: Momus, who controuled all the gods without exception blamed Ʋulcan, for that he did not set a grate at mans breast; that others might pry into his thoughts, yet Luc. 9. 55 a man knowes not his owne spirit except hee doth examine it, but let him examine it, yea double his exa∣mination, as the Apostle doth 2. Cor. 13 5. double his exhortation, yet when he hath done all, and sifted what he can, his spirit is not so manifest to himselfe as it is vnto God, and therefore Dauid con∣fessing, that Psa. 13. 29 God knoweth euery mans thoughts long before they enter into his minde, desireth God Psa. 19. 12 to cleanse him euen from his secret faults, he could not vnderstand his owne faults,
but confesseth that God is well acquainted with those sinnes in the inmost concauity of the heart, vnto which hee him∣selfe was but astranger. The mind of man goeth vp to the heauens, goeth downe to the deepe, entreth into a thousand places without remo∣uing, the light of the sunne cannot bee shut vp in any place, but sheddeth it selfe into all places, and is present with all things: wee see in essence and presence, if the creature bee in so many places, where shall the creator not bee? if there bee such light in the one, what light shall bee in the other: in the father of lights: in respect of whom the sunne it selfe is but a snuffe. God is as Giges, when hee had turned the head of his ring to the palme of his hand, he is seene of none, and ouerseeth all: wee see God but in a glasse, saculum est speculum, this glasse was cleere before the fall, but now Cor. 13. 12 wee see through a glasse dar∣kely, but God seeth vs in open light, ex antica facie, as well as ex postico tergo: ad intra, as well as ad extra, the thoughts of our hearts, as well as the words of our lippes, and workes of our hands. Ionah, Ion. 1. 2. Arise and goe to Niniueh that great City, and cry against it; but Ionah knoweth that the iustice and mercy of God, like the Ioh. 20. 4 two disciples run together, and that his mercy out-runs his iustice, as the other disciple did out-run Peter, and came first to the sepulchre: and therefore thinking, that when Iustice and mercy had a while striued together, as Gē. 25. 22 Esau and Iacob in Rebeccaes wombe, mercy at length (to the cracking of his credit) would get the vpper hand; therfore he is bound for Tarsus, and imbarking himselfe in a ship intendeth to crosse the seas, hoping that a fauourable winde will send him a short cut, but howso∣euer his hope was frustrated in the latter, yet his opinion did not deceiue him in the former: for when Iustice would haue preuailed, mercy did put in, and sped herselfe to the rescue, herewithall. Ionas being at dagger drawing, saith, Ion. 4. 2. was not this my word, when I was yet in my country? Ionah it was not thy word, it was but thy thought, this thought was locked and closed vp in thy heart, as in a priuy chamber, it had not yet gone out at the doore of thy lips, and vented it selfe by words to other mens eares, thy tongue had not yet beene a publike notary of thy heart, nor thy mouth a messenger of thy minde,
or a vocall interpretor of that, which thou hadst contriued; why then doest thou say, was not this my word; when as yet thy tongue was hid in thy heart? on the one side I would not haue the tongue tyed, or haue the put a gagge in thy mouth; or hide thy sinnes either by negation as Selomns curtizan; Pro. 30. 20. who wipeth her mouth, and it is not shee: or extinuation, as to say as Lot of Zoar, Gē. 19. 20 is it not a little one? or Iustification, as the Iewes,s Ioh. 8. 48 say wee not well, that thou art a Samaritan and hast a Diuell. Sinne is a bad bloud, and let confession be the opening of a vaine to let it out, let the mouth bee as that gate in Ierusalem, Neh. 3. 14 thorough which all the filth in the City was carryed out; but on the o∣ther side, wilt thouly accusing thy selfe of that, whereof thou art not guilty, make thy selfe worse then thou art: shall other mens tongues licke their owne sores, as Luc. 16. 21. the dogs doe La∣zarus, and shall thy tongue sting thy selfe, and make a sore when none is. Why wilt thou bee such a Cipher and cutter of thy selfe? is not enough for thee to haue some venome in thy stomacke, when thou wishest, that God would rather ouer∣throwx Ion. 4. 3. the City, then that thy credit should bee empaired in sparing it; but thou must also affirme to the slandering of thy selfe, that like a madde dogge, thou diddest lay out a vene∣mous tongue? but I condemne not thy discretion; thou spa∣kest to God, to whom thy thought is a word, for he to whom darknesse and light are both alike, seeth the very entrailes of the soule, the very heart of the heart as cleerely, as he vnder∣stands the language of the tongue, and speach of the lips; Nay sometime, as in prayer, a thought is a cry, and a cry, but a still voice, for such may it bee, that God will turne away his eare, and hee will neuer heare it: Why doth the holy Ghost charge the Scribes with speaking slander, when they did but thinke, Christ did blaspheme, in saying to the palsie man, Mat 9. 3. Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee: it was within themselues; how was it then a saying? this is a kinde of solecisme, and being like vnto false Latine, seemeth to haue much incongruity: the heart is a scabbard, wherein the thought is sheathed: it is not a word, till the tongue, as a hand doth draw it forth: the heart was a ci∣sterne, which held this poysoned licour, it was not a word, except the tongue as a pipe had sent it out. The tongues then of the Scribes, not being busied about this blaspheming, but cō∣cealing
what they thought: why doth the holy Ghost say, they said it? was it because he would clippe the credit of the Scribes, and by this meanes make them lighter esteemed? that be farre from him, God forbid, that the righteous God should finde fault, because he would depraue, because he would disgrace, or sacke any mans name: Iob 24. 12. hee doth not charge men with folly, when they deserue it, and will he charge them, when they de∣serue it not? that bee farre from him. But the reason is this, because the thought and the voice are equally audible to him, that heareth without eares: because hee that made the heart and the tongue, the reines, and the lippes vnderstands the language of both, of all alike. Because hee is as neere to the speach of the thought, as voice of the mouth: And there∣fore I shut vp this Doctrine with that excellent saying of Saint Augustine: God is a light which no other light can see, a brightnesse, which no other brightnesse beholdeth; a light which darkeneth all othet lights; a brightnesse which blin∣deth all outward sight: a light of whom commeth all light: a brightnesse in comparison whereof all other brightnes, is but dimnes: a light vnto whom all darknesse is light, and all dimnes bright: a light which no blindnesse can ouershadow, no mist can dimme, no let can foreclose, no shadow keepe of, which enlightneth all things wholy, together at once, and euer: Thus much of the Doctrine, gathered from the Argument, vsed in this place; that therefore wee must not withdrawe our hearts from God, to set them vpon strange Gods; because our inside as well as our outside is before him: full before his face. But as they which haue blemishes in their eyes, thinke the sky to bee ouer cloudy; so some, when the Prince of this world hath blinded their eyes, (as the Rauen strikes out the sheeps eye, as Iudg 16. 21. the Philistims boared out Sampsons eyes, as 1 Mach. 1 23. Antiochus took away the candle-sticke for the light of the Temple) thinke, that God is couered with clouds, Esay. 29. 15. that there is a mist before his eyes, so that hee cannot gage into the bottome of the thoughts. Why (say they) did God, when hee would ouer∣throw Sodome, and breake the gall of Gommorhas heart, and powre the cuppe of his wrath vpon Admah, and Zeboim; why did hee say, Gen. 18. 21. hee would first goe downe, and see, whether
they had committed crying sinnes, before hee rained fire and brimstone vpon them from heauen; if his insight were such, as hee did vnderstand the thoughts long before? For resolution whereof wee must consider, that God speaketh  after the manner of vpright iudges, who sift the cause and sound the depth of the matter, before they send a plague vpon male∣factors: whereout as the Prophet speaketh, they shall not bee able to plucke their necks. Vniust Iudges sitting in Caiphasd Mic. 2. 3. seate, Mat. 26. 66 first giue the sentence, then aske the opinion what o∣ther thinke. The Captaine peruerting all equity, Act. 22. 24 commandeth Paul to bee scourged and examined; here is , the cart be∣fore the horse, iustice turned topsie turuy, Captaine, is this souldiour like to wound a man vpon his backe? is it iustice like, to throw away the ballance, that Iustice holdeth in her hand: to sit and iudge according to the law: this is the Magistates duty; but to command one to bee stricken contrary to the law, before hee bee examined, this is tyranny: wilt thou haue an archer shoote right, before hee sees the marke: why doest thou thus turne iudgement into gall, and the fruit of righteousnesse into wormewood. God doth not take this course, but Amos 7. 8. he sets his line before hee heweth with his axe, and our Sauiour Christ speaketh first of the accusation, then of the condemnation, Io. 8. 10 wo∣man where are thine accusers, hath no man condemned thee? God will spend his plagues vpon the wicked, and bestow his arrowes on them, hee will speake vnto them in his wrath, and vexe them in his sore displeasure: vpon the Sodomites, hee will raine snares, fire and brimstone, this shall bee their portion to drinke, he will make them like a fiery ouen in time of his wrath, but to shew that his hand shall not take hold on this iudgement, before his eye hath taken view of the inditement: hee saith, I will goe downe and see: and still obserue this in the will of the Lord, he neuer makes his hands executors: but first he makes his eyes the ouerseers, and this is that which is in the Prophet Amos, Amos 9. 8 the eyes of the Lord God, are vpon the sinfull Kingdome, and I will de∣stroy it cleane out of the earth. But againe, if God doth spread his eyes vpon all, and Iob 25. 3 as Bildad saith his light doth arise vpon them, if he bee like Miner∣ua, who was so portrayed by the cunning Painter Amulis,
that which way soeuer on cast his eye, she alwayes looked on him, Iob. 1. 7. why doth he aske Satan from whence hee came? Why, Gen. 44. 19. will not you giue Ioseph leaue, to aske his brethren that which he knoweth already. Our Sauiour Christ knoweth that the blind mans suite, is for recouery of his sight, but yet asketh, Luc. 18. 41. what wilt thou that I doe vnto thee: First that the blind man might be the more stirred vp to pray, as one loath to loose audience for want of speaking out. Secondly that the Miracle in restoring sight might appeare the greater, when the infirmitie was made knowne by his owne confession. Thirdly that the standers by might be edified by his putting vp so discreete a Petition, Lastly to shew that God will haue as well Mat. 6. 8. the calues of the lippes, as calues of the heart, and though being wisdome Rom. 8. 29. he knoweth our neede, and being mercy heareth our very groanes, yet will haue both heart and tongue to pay tribute, though the prayer be neuer so short a Briefe, neuer so little a Current of speach. For a great Ocean of matter Elisha to Gehezi, whence commest thou Gehezi? not but that Elisha knew that he had followed after. Naaman, for 2. Kin. 5. 25. 26. went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned againe from his Chariot to meete thee. But that the answere of Gehezi might shew vs the equitie of the punish∣ment which was inflicted on him, not only for running after Naaman, not only for taking Talents and garments, but for lye and all: so the Lord sayd vnto Satan: Iob. 1. 7. whence comest thou? Not but that he knew from whence he came; but that the answere of Satan, I come from compassing the earth too and fro, and from walk∣ing in it, might teach vs the nature of Satan, 1. Pet. 5. 8. who goeth a∣bout like a roaring Lyon seeking whom he may deuour. And as the Panther so hateth man that he setteth vpon the image of man and teares it in pieces, so Satan, when he cannot set vpon God, sets vpon man the image of God. Againe Iob. 1. 12. Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, not that hee went out of Gods sight, but that he hasted to speede his commission. Againe Iob. 22. 12. is not God on high in heauen: not that he is in∣closed in the heauens, but because there is such a marke of his Maiesty and glory. Againe, Gen. 28. 16. surely God is in this place, not that he is not in another place, but there he sheweth a plaine euidence of his presence.
Againe Gen. 13. 13. I am the God of Bethel: not that he is Anchored in those narrow straights, but that he might put Iacob in remem∣brance of the promise, that there was made vnto him. For if he can truely say in Plautus vbi sum, ibi non sum, vbi non sum ibi a∣nimus est. If 2. Kin. 5. 26. Elishaes spirit goes with Gehezi if 1. Cor. 5. 3. Saint Paul absent from the Corinthians in body, was present with them in spirit; much more shall God, (I speake now of the second person in Trinity) who is gone hence & absent in his humanity, be in his Diuine nature present with all things as one, and with each thing as all to the end of the world. God then is cleare from misty cloudes and cloudy mistes which the vngodly say, doe dazle his eyes, that he cannot see. The Doctrine remaineth true God is as one that watcheth to spy what we doe, he keep∣eth watch and ward ouer vs, day and night, marketh all our walkes, all our talkes as a continuall ouerseer, and therefore Iob calleth the Lord, Iob. 7. 20 the Keeper of men: and indeed he is the Lord Keeper, who whither we consider him as he is in the hea∣uen that same Starre-chamber, or in the conscience, as in the Chancery, to doe equitie, hath our sinnes as a seale against vs borne and layd before him, and though he hold his tongue, Ps. 50. 21 (which maketh vs to thinke that he is euen such a one as our selues) yet when he sees his time, he will reproue vs; and set before vs the things which we haue done. The vse of this Doctrine is manifold, First it serueth for the comfort of such as are oppressed, let mens hearts be as hard as brasse, and as the nether Mil-stone, let oppressors be, os. 5. 1. as a snare on Mizpha, and a net spred vpon Tabor, let gaine be their godly∣nes, fraud and violence their direct way to wealth, let them coyne their money on poore mens skines, & wring the sponges of poore people into their owne purses: Let them not watch and prey, but watch to pray, let them like great fishes deuour the small, and be nibling on euery baite, though Mat. 17. 27. like Saint Pe∣ters fish their mouthes be full of gold, let them when they should Ex. 23. 4. deale well with their enemies Asse; make their friends Asses and send them a begging, let them when they Mat. 25. 36. should cloath the naked, strip those that are cloathed, and when they Deu. 27. 17. should let stand still the marke of the Land, take away house and land both, this as it is a terror to the oppressors, so a com∣fort to the oppressed, to consider, that all this is before God:
it is sap in the Vine in the winter of affliction, a golden sheild in the hand, which breakes the stroake of all oppression, to con∣sider that Gods eyes are open, and he doth as well behold them which doe the wrong, as them which suffer it: Act. 7. 3 I haue seene, I haue seene the affliction of my people, doubling his sight, because he did behold and consider, looke vpon with the outward eye of his countenance, looke into it with the inward eye of compassi∣on. And this did season the bitternes of the bondage of Israel, as Ex. 15. 2. the Tree which Moses cast into the spring of Marah did season the bitternes of the waters, and in the captiuity of Babilon this was a combe of hony in the Lyons belly, a sawce to make the sower sweet, when Israel should consider that though they were taken away from their countrey, they could not be taken away from God, whose title was a like to all places though they had gone vp into heauen, or downe into hell, or dwelt in the vtter. most parts of the sea. Secondly this serueth for our instruction, it is a prouocation to vertue, to consider that though man mindeth not our good deedes, yet God vieweth them, though there were no reward for well doing, yet virtus per se, and the testimony of a mans owne conscience were sufficient to moue him to good, but there is a greater testimony, for God is greater then the conscience, and seeth all, and Mat. 6. 6. he that seeth in secret will reward openly. Againe it is a bridle to pull vs backe from much vngodlynes, what sinne is it but might goe a begging for want of seruice, if we did thorowly see that Gods eye were vpon it. The Adulter∣er that layes wait at the doore of his neighbour, and delighteh in a strange woman, and transgressing the boundes of honesty yeelds his flesh to the seruice of Venus, would make this sinne a Mittimus, would not moyle his body in filth and infection, no not in the darke, as though he could closely conuey his sinne vnder a Canopy, if he did thoroughly bethinke himselfe that to God darknes and light were both alike. Rash censure would restraine their verdict, if they consider, they entred vpon the possession and freehold of God whose consistory is in the heart. Hypocrysie and guilded piety should haue a pasport, if wee thought that God did search narrowly the very inward and hidden pith of the roote, the feare of God would stand at the doore of the heart, and not suffer the close idolatry forbidden
in this precept to haue an entrance if we marke that God saith here, it is before me, open in my sight. In a word what one sinne should finde entertainement with vs, if we thoroughly weighed this, that not only the conscience which is a thousand witnesses. But God who is a thousand consciences did still ouer-looke vs, the one as an accuser to lay to our charge, against which there is no exception, the other as a Iudge to giue sentence, from whom there is no appeale who hath his name  of  to see, because the very graue is naked before him. Neither is he such a God as the heathen fained their bifronted Iaxus, to whom they dedicated the first moneth of the yeare, setting him out with two faces, with the one looking back to the yeare past, with the other looking for∣ward to the yeare to com: for if he did only see such sinnes as were but a yeare old, we neede neuer pray with Dauid Psa. 25. 7 forgiue me the sinnes of my youth, then such sinnes as we had a yeare out∣liued, being like our common Almanackes out of date at the yeares end, should be cast behind his backe, and we might hane a pardon by course, or be quit by Proclamation, for who should lay any thing to our charge, when God against whom we haue offended, had forgotten, but therefore we must auoyde sinnes of youth, sinnes of age, sinnes of dotage past present and to come, because they are all before him, Reu. 1. 8. who is the ancient of dayes α and ω the beginning and the end the first and the last. If we meete with bad debtters, yet happely vpon good tearmes, such as the debtter vseth in the Gospell, Mat. 18. 26. haue patience with mee, and I will pay thee all: we are content to beare with them, and to suffer them to delay the payment, but if thorough breaking many dayes we dispaire of the debt, wee eyther let them goe vpon some easie composition, or dismissing them for want of abilitie we burne their bandes, but it is not thus with God, wee are debters to him, and he must be satisfied, the band is written, signed, sealed, yea forfeited and broken, he calleth vpon vs to take some order with him, he knocketh at the doore of our eares by his word, and hauing a patience beyond all patience, sends his Bayliffes to warne before he doth arrest, a sound of woe be∣fore we, but if the debt be not discharged, he doth not burne the band, but still our sinnes are before him, not sinnes of the yeare past, or sinnes of the yeare to come, but sinnes wherein
we were conceiued, sinnes which shall lye downe with vs in the dust, they all remaine scored vp, and being registred in his booke of accounts, stand in Record; for without satisfaction, there is no remission, the onely remedy we haue is to repaire to Christ for a quittance, to begge of him a Quietus est, to shew God a generall release vpon his satisfaction of the det, desi∣ring, that it would please him, in him to be well pleased. The second Commandement. Exod. 20. 4. 5. 6. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image, nor the likenes of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath: or in the water vnder the earth. Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them: For I the Lord thy God, am a iealous God, and visit the sins of the Fathers vpon the Children, vnto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and shew mercy vnto thousands to them that loue me and keepe my Commandements. IT was a saying of the Orator Demosthe∣nes, non modo scripta, but if it were possi∣ble, sculpta etiam loqueretur: for mine owne part I cannot speake scripta, in print (as they say) for the forme of my words, (nor prune my syllables, mince my words, martiall my phrases, and graue my speach with paintings: let bad spokesmen doe this; who being sent to wooe for God, doe speake for themselues; onely my care is, that too rude and carelesse words doe not slubber vp good matter, and vnhansome cloathes mishape a good body:) but I must needs speake sculpta: for the substance of my matter, speake of that which is carued, of that which is grauen, of that which is painted, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image, nor the likenes, &c. in which words, the prohibition forbiddeth vs false∣ly to worship the true God, or giue his true worship to a false God; condemning such, as are stained with their own workes, and goe a whoring with their owne inuentions.
The Iniunction requireth vs to worshippe one true and e∣uerlasting God, in sincerity and truth as he hath prescribed in his word; commending such as kisse the sonne, and washing their hands in innocency, doe compasse his altar. Tereasons to make vs bow our necks to this yoke are two. The first is taken from Gods loue vnto vs, I the Lord thy God a a italous God: as if the Lord should say, my heart did cleaue vnto thee, my soule did long for thee, I did kisse thee with the kisses of my mouth, I entred into a couenant with thee and thou becamest mine, neither can I in any case abide, that thou shouldest be vnto any other, therefore let me bee as a bun∣dle of mirrhe vnto thee, let mee and none other lie betweene thy breastes. The second is taken from the loue of man to his posterity, visiting the sinnes of the Fathers vpon the Children, &c. As if the Lord should say; if you loue your children, which are flesh of your flesh, bone of your bones, deuided peeces of your owne bodies, and liuely pictures of your selues, then doe not say to the worke of your hands, yee are our gods; but serue me with gladnes, and offer to me the sacrifice of righteousnesse, for my song is iudgement and mercy, my visitation is like checker∣worke, blacke and white, they which dishonour me shall come to shame they and theirs, their children, and their childrens children, but those that honor me, I will honour them, and their posterity for euer more. The hand of this Commandement leadeth mee to consider: First the manner in deliuering it, then the matter contained in it, each of these hauing such variety of notes, worthy to bee obserued, that plenty it selfe making mee poore: I know not where to beginne, but let my first Obseruation in the manner of deliuery be this: Our nature is very subiect and prone to this sinne of Idolatry. Wee are very ready to erect vp altars vnto Baal, and to hold vp our hands to a strange God, for otherwise this com∣mandement might haue been as short, as that which went be∣fore, or that which followeth after; and the Lord needed not haue giuen a double charge, or haue made a double fence hadge, and ditch to keepe vs within bounds, that wee transgres∣sed not: for this cause Ieremy compareth Israell Ier. 2. 20. 23. 24. to a run-about
harlot, because she multiplied her fornication, and could not be satisfied: s to a swift Dromedary, because shee did run more swiftly, then a horse to the superstition of other Nations: t to a wild Asse, because shee could not bee wearied or made tame. One sin of Israell was couetousnes, Hab. 1. 15 they tooke vp all with the angle, they catched it in their net, and gathered it in their yarne: they loued siluer and were not satisfied with siluer, whatsoeuer their measure held, it was still capable of more, but to set vp idoatry; they are content to part not with their siluer onely, but with their gold also, though they be farre fetcht and deare bought, euen with the aduenture of their owne liues, Ier. 10. 9 Siluer plates are brought from arshis, and gold from Vphaz, for the worke of the workeman▪ and the hands of the founder. But this mettall was not yet tryed and fined, but remained in a rude lumpe, and so it was a smaller matter to depart with it, and therefore more then so, Iud. 17. 4 Michahs mother toke two hundred shikels of siluer, and gaue them to the founder, who made thereof a grauen and molten image; and more then so: In Exodus the women (though women commonly loue to braue it more then men, and to attire themselues more, trimly then stands with their husbands state, to whom it is death to goe from their iewels) are content to strip themselues of that, which is most deare vn∣to them to make a golden Calfe. Ex. 32. 2. Pluck off (saith Aaron, here∣by thinking to restraine themselues from sinne, especially con∣sidering, Ex. 30. 13 their taxation lately past, and the displeasure that might arise vnto the husbands from their wiues in time to come) the eare-rings, the golden earerings, (which to weare was, and yet is the faion in the east Countries) which are in the eares of your wiues, of your sonnes, and of your daughters: and bring them to mee: stay there Aaron, goe no further, neuer adde, that you wilt make an Image of them, for thou hast already said enough, and more then enough, for the women like an ar∣row out of a bow, or a bowle down a hill without commoning hasten about the businesse, beeing ready to fulfill thy demande before thou hast ended thy words; and to bid the husbands plucke the eare rings was more then needed, for they them∣selues plucke them from themselues, and bring them to thee: if Aaron hadbut said, bring mee some gold, though not wrought, a man woudl haue thought it had beene as good as
a supersedea to their idolatrous petition: if but a little siluer be demanded of vs, to buy a Bible, make a pulpit, repaire a Church, or prouide any thing fit for Gods seruice, wee play Mat. 19. 22. the young man in the Gospell: and if we cannot possibly slip the coller, we goe away sorrowfull: but to make an image the women bring gold, wrought gold, Iewels of gold, and and though they loue to be in the fashion, yet put themselues out of fashion, to fashion an Idoll. What great affection and loue doth Nature worke in pa∣rents towards their children, being liuely pictures and wel∣king images of themselues? How neere went this saying to A∣brahams heart, Cast out the bond woman and her sonne; hee knew that the promised seed should come of his sonne Isaac. Gen. 21. 11. yet this thing was grieuous in his sight; because of his sonne. Iacob supposing that Ioseph had been dead, vowed to mourne for him all his life long, Gen. 37. 35. I will goe downe to the graue to my sonne mourning: but hea∣ring of his welfare, the text saith, that (as though hee had been as good as dead before) Gen. 45. 27. the spirit of Iacob reuiued. Necessity is a sore weapon, and what a plague is this, when God doth not helpe men with the barne, or the wine-presse, when they must cut vp nettles by the bushes, and Iuniper roots must bee their meat: when God giues cleannesse of teeth in all their Cities, and scarsenesse of bread in all their habitations: yet when God called for a famine on the land, and destroyed the prouision of bread, Iacob had rather remaine hungry and thirsty, and haue his soule faint in him, Gen. 42. 38. then part with Beniamin his sonne to fet prouision, supposing it would bee to the danger of his life. Moses sheweth, that when his mother Iochebed was not able to keepe him any longer then three moneths from the ty∣ranny of Pharaoh, shee committing him to the prouidence of God, Ex. 2. 3. dawbed an Arke made of reed, with slime and pitch, and put it into the water: not mentioning any thing that Amram his father did in the husines, because he was so ouercome with griefe, that he could not doe any thing: for as luctus loquitur, le∣es, ingentse stupent, sorrowes in their mediocrities speake, but in their extemities are silent. so in their mediocrities they worke; but in extremities sit downe and let all alone. When Agamemnon must offer vp but his daughter Ithigeni only, though happily not his only daughter, such as was the
Iudg. 11 34. sacrifice of Iphtah, the paintr sets him out with his face coue∣red, because he could not sufficiently expresse his sorrowfull countenance, neyther (though the teares stole downe his cheekes) could the sighes, which brake from the center of his heart, be discouered by the map of his looke; Therefore when his colours would not serue to expresse that he meant, hee sha∣dowed him with a Veyle. But so ready were the Iewes to this sinne of Idolatry, 1. Kin. 11. 5. that in honor of Moloch, alias Milcon, the Idol of the Almmonites, they not only cast out one sonne with Abraham, expose one sonne o danger with Iacob, sacrifice one daughter with Agamemnon: but 2. Kin. 23. 10. burned and sacrificed many of their children both sonnes and daughters, though they had Leu. 18. 21. a straight Commandement to the contrary, yea and that Leu. 20. . 5. vnder a grieuous payne, no lesse then death: which God would inflict, though man should wincke at it, and to the end nature might not moue them to compassion, when they should heare the pittifull cry of their children, they had instruments of Mu∣sicke, and sounding of Bells to drowne their wofull noyse and lamentation. It is a shame for any one to take away that which of right be∣longeth to another, a shame for the father  to bring vp a Childe with crooked nayles, and for a husband to match with a wife that is as light on finger as Asahel on foot; 2 Sam. 2. 18. as light as a wilde Roe: yet Rahel not regarding her owne shame, the shame that might arise to her father Laban, and to her husband Iacob, nor the displeasure that she might incur of them both, is so adicted to superstition that Gen. 31. 19. she steales away her fathers Idols. To come vnto ourselues, a man may say of vs, as Saint Paul of the Athenians, Act 17. 23. I perceiue that in all things you are too super∣stitious: What great cost in former times haue great men be∣stowed in building of Abbeys, and Cels of superstition, and that in the fat of the land: What free liberties did they grant them, with how large priuiledge and possessions did they en∣dowe them, and though men did not really with the Iewes offer their sonnes and daughters vnto diuels, yet did they in very deede delicate them to the seruice of images: though with Rahel they did not steale away false gods, yet did their Priests steale away the hearts of the people, and entring vpon the right
of the almighty rob, the true God of his honour. What pilgrimages did men make farre and nigh to Saintes seuerall shrines; when the Bull of Pope Clement 6. giuen out An. 1350. for his yeare of Iubiley bellowed thus; No paine of hell shall touch any, which for deuotion sake take their Peregrination to the holy City, what a number of calues flocked to Rome? fiue thou∣sand Peregrines did euery day goe in and out at the gates of the City: Neither did this superstition rest onely in the common sort of people▪ but King Henry 2. went on Pilgrimage to Tho∣mas Beckets Tombe, Edward the first escaping a danger, (it was the fall of a mighty stone from a Vawte directly ouer the place where hee sat playing at Chesse with one of his souldiers, which place, hauing no occasion giuen, hee but euen then had voyded) in stead of honoring the liuing Lord for his great de∣liuerance, goes on Pilgrimage to our Lady at Walsingham. that this hot deuotion in man might not wax colde, there was many times a vow made, the more to kindle it, a vow did set a tor and ouerseer ouer the will to keepe it from going backe, and indeed was an entring into band to performe it: such was the vow of Queene Blanch, who when Lewes the French King her sonne was sicke, as it was thought, vnto death, vowed in the person of her sonne: that if the Lord would visit him with health, he should visit his Sepulcher, & there solemne∣ly giue thankes, in the land which hee had sanctified with his bloud. But let this suffice to haue spoken of the prone inclinati∣on of man to this sinne of Idolatry, for loue whereof he spare∣eth no cost, he spareth no trauayle, but goes his Pilgrimage to Caunterbury, to Yorke, to Beuerly, to Karligton, to Wilsdon, yea beyond sea to Compostella, to Ierusalem, to Rome, euen thither should his bare feet carry him with an offring. This forwardnes in our predecessors, to honor Idols, in the time of darknes, and blinde ignorance, shall condemne our backwardnes for the true seruice of God in these sun-shining dayes of the Gospell; they had zeale without knowledge, with∣out learning, and therefore were blind: we haue knowledge without zeale, without discretion, and therefore are pur-blind: they had cause to wring their hands and take vp an howling, that they did know so little, we haue cause to rent our hearts, and 2. Sam. 13 91. with Tamar clasping our hands vpon our heads to goe to
crying, to cry as a woman trauailing, or as one laboring of her first child, because we haue known so much to so little pur∣pose. This knowledge is but contristans, because wee run with our eyes open to sinne. Wee may be ashamed to put on that loose, and tattered gar∣ment in the day, which they with lesse shame did weare in the night, Our defects are so much the greater, by how much wee haue better meanes to supply our wants: Mat. 11. 20. therefore were the Iewes worse, then the Gentiles, because these onely trans∣gressed the law of Nature: but they the law of Nature, of Mo∣ses, of grace; therefore were they worse, because they might haue been better. This possibility gaue height to their sinne: in a word, let vs not who haue the bright light of the Gospell, come short in zeale of those which had but the dim candle-light of Nature; let vs not, who haue the law of God in our mother tongue, pointing more directy to the true God; then any fin∣ger to the dyall, haue our motions kindled with lesse true zeale then theirs were igne fatuo, which had the booke of God but clasped vp in an vnknowne language; let vs not, who haue knowledge, and can speake diuers tongues, bee to seeke in the language of Canaan; be to seeke to sing the songs of Sion: di∣uine notes of Halleluiah, and glory to God in the highest. Know∣ledge without zeale is a lame sacrifice, zeale without know∣ledge is a blind sacrifice: Mal. 1. 8. Malachy will haue neither offred to God; therefore let them not like Ioh. 20. 4 the two Disciples, Peter and Iohn, or 2 Sam. 18 21. the two Messengers, which Ioab sent to carry Dauid tidings of his deliuerance, one out-run the other; but as the two Luc. 24. 13. Disciples when they went to Emmaus, goe together, arme in arme like man and wife, cheeke by ioul as Hippocrates twines, if one be lacking, there will want a ronge of Iacobs ladder, it will be too short to reach vnto heauen. Or the likenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath; or in the water vnder the earth: Ex malis moribus bona'leges natae sunt, bad diseases haue giuen occasion of good remedies in that; therefore God forbids not onely images in generall, but so many sorts in particular; (some in heauen, as birds that flie in the firmament of heauen, the Sun and Moone, and Sarres, the whole hoast of heauen: some in earth, as the similitude of
men and beasts, and creeping things, some in the sea, as the likenesse of fishes): I note that to be true which the Lord spea∣keth, according to the number of thy Cities were thy Gods O Iudah,y Ier. 11. 13 and according to the number of the streets of Ierusalem haue yee set vp altars of confusion. The minde of man is a glasse, so long as a glasse remaineth whole, there is but one face of him, which looketh in it, repre∣sented backe againe; but if it bee once crackt or broken; let but one man looke in it, there appeares so many faces, as there be crases: so is it with the minde of man, as long as it conti∣nued sound and whole, there shined in it but the image of one true God; but when by a fall it once lost this integrity, then it receiued sundry images, and Gods maiesty was disgui∣sed by variety of Idols. But yet I doe not reade of any open idolatry before the floud, but after the floud, it entred euen into the posterity of Sem; for Ioshua said vnto all the Tribes of Israell, that their fa∣thers, Ios. 24. 2 euen Terah the father of Abraham, serued other gods, the threds of this sinne did thy draw so bigge and so long, that they made them cords of vanity; they did wreath these cords till they became cart-rops of iniquity; busying themselues in their owne dreames and doting fancies, till God caused them to be carried away captiue vnto Babilon. But after the captiuity Israel said; Hos. 14. 9. what haue I to doe any more with Idols; Hos. 2. 7. I will goe and returne to my first husband, I will not play the harlot, and be to any other, neither did they change the house of God into a shop of Idolatry; no when the Roman Emperours would haue thrust images vpon them, they chose rather to die a thousand times, then lay Gods honour open to the spoile of creatures: neither could they euer bee brought to admit into their Temple the Standard of the Ro∣mans: neither was there found any pensill, relike, or image in their temple; 1 Mac. 1. 23. neither when Antiochus Epiphanes sackt it for co∣uetousnesse, or when Pompey spared it for reuerence; nay they were so farre from worshipping the worke of mens hands, that they would not admit painter or caruer into their City. But all this while among the Gentiles, Idolatry did lift vp her head, till the Apostles came, who cryed out vpon it, down with it, downe with it euen to the ground, then such as God
had added to his Church that they might bee saued; put away the strange Gods that were among them, ouerthrew their al∣tars, broake their images in peeces, cut downe their groues, destroyed all their pictures, pluckt downe all their high places, broake downe their pillers, and burnt their images with fire. But in processe of time (for if the diuell bee cast out, he is dis∣contented, and saith; Mat. 12. 44. I will returne into mine house from whence I came) God was againe put out of doores, and his house chan∣ged into an idolatrous shop. For about the yeere of our Lord 490. Gregory the first, (the worst of all the 63. Bishops of Rome, that went before him, and the best of all the 175. that follow∣ed, since him;) though he vtterly condemned the worshipping of images; yet thought it not amisse, to haue them in Chur∣ches, as necessary Alphabets for lay men, and good shep∣heards Kalenders. The diuell now hauing gotten an inch would take an ell, and hauing gotten in his head, like a subtile serpent, made his whole body follow after; for when the Emperours of the East, and the Popes of Rome were at daggers drawing, they, to put downe images, these, to vpholde them, so mighti∣ly grew the power of the Popes, that they preuailed: then mens hearts were not perfit with the Lord, they went a who∣ring after their owne eyes, looking to other gods; they said to the wood awake, and to the dumbe stone, stand vp; they asked counsell of their stocks, and their staffe taught them, they had many altars to sinne, and villany was seen in their houses: I would spend no further pilgrimage in this walke, but that so many seuerall gods present themselues vnto my view: which if I should goe about to number, they should bee more then I am able to expresse. To omit therefore the Persians, which had as many gods, as there were Starres in the sky, and fires on the earth, the Greekes, which had as many gods, as they had fan∣cies, the Romanes, which canonized so many new gods, as their Senate would alow: to omit this infinite variety, there were twelue principall gods: Iuno, Ʋesta, Minerua, Ceres, Diana, Ʋenus, Mars, Mercurius, Iupiter, Neptune, Vulcanus, Apollo. To these were added Saturne, lest he might seeme to be wrong∣ed, since his sonne Iupiter was a god, and his mother Vesta was a goddesse, and also Bacchus, because being a hot fellow hee
might make some fray: seeing Cres was one goddesse, and Venus was another: herein Europ were gods for particular Countreys; S. Iames for Spaine, S. Dennis for Fraunce, S. Patricke for Ireland, S. George for England, & in England were gods for particular Citties, S. William of Yorke, S. Thomas of Caunterbury, and Bonauenture. (but it is a venture if you find any good in it) in his Ladyes Psalter, makes the Virgin Mary as good a Goddesse, as Iehouah is a God in Dauids Psalter; he Lord, she Lady, he our Patron, she our Patro∣nesse, he the King, she the Queene of heauen: there were gods for particular Parishes, S. Stephen for one, S. Nicholas for another, S. Eustan &c. yea particular houses (for how low will not this sinne creepe) had their Lares and Penates, their Houshold gods, gods which were thought to belong to euery seuerall person, thus did they giue God as many companions, as there were Saints some∣times sainted those, which neuer were, but had only a fancyed be∣ing. The reliques of Saints being as it were feathers of these same birdes, were birdes of the same feather, and as much abused to idolatry as were the Saints themselues, commanded to be wor∣shipped in Germany in the time of Pope Gregory the second. There was anciently in the time of Popery a relique sunday so∣lemnely kept in diuers places of this land, in which this was a∣custome in some Church, where were many Ministers; (for I know not how generall the custome was) they did beare in their hands about a procession on that day euery one a relique; as Bishop Bec∣kets Ratchet, S. Georges his dagger, or the like trash: Which the Sexten was wont to deliuer to them, and to be sure none should be without his relique, after the Sexten, came the Verger downe from the high Altar, with a relique in his hand, asking this questi∣on, who lackes a relique? I will not speake heere of our Ladyes milke, of the bloud at Hayles, of good King Henry his spurre, nor of the nayles▪ which nayled Christ to the Crosse, which I maruaile they should be so idolatrously worshipped being instruments in the death of Christ▪ I let passe licre sundry other creatures, as Wax, Water, Oyle, Salt, Incense, Pilgrimstaues, and I know not how many beside; which after exocismes, hallowingrs, consecra∣tions, and blessings ouer them, were made Idoles: and thought to be of more  & power then they were by their owne proper nature, though  alteration and change in them, but a word or  and Crosses and then I proceed.
The publicke, the priuate, the trentall and dirge Masses forged in the Popes shop, and as they are now, but some of his youngest daughters are whelpes of the same hare: in which they worship∣ped an Idoll Cake, as Israell did an Idoll Calfe; they first worship∣ped the sacrament, and then offred it vp as a sacrifice for remission of sinnes, they carryed it about in Gold and Siluer to be worship∣ped, & shewed it to the people, attributing great vertue to it, for it deliuered (as they taught) ex opere operato, by the deed once done quick and dead a pana et culpa from the punishment and the fault. By vertue thereof they did apply the merits and passion of Christ to whom they pleased them, & what could be more derogatory to this Commandement, or more preiudiciall to the bloud of Christ, to his bloud, I say, which euery man must apply to himselfe by his owne beleeuing, not the Priest or any other Parson apply to an other by any worke doing. What disease was there in man or beast, against which this (as they would perswade the people) was not a remedy: By this, if any man went beyond sea, they pro∣mised to him prosperous Nauigation, if he kept home, it would safely keepe him from dangers, and sufficiently defend him from all bugs; And therefore when danger was towards Becket, for his misdeameanors against the King, his friends counsayled him to haue a Masse in the honor of S. Stephen, to keepe him frō the hands of his enemies: who accordingly addressed himselfe to his Masse with all solemnity, thinking thereby to charme away all euils. In a word they would haue this idolatrous perswasion confirmed, that it did merit release of all calamities, it merited gayne and lucre in common trafficke, it merited wharsoeuer the carefull heart of man could desire. Concerning the Crosse, Popery made it as great an Idoll, as the Masse, and attributed no lesse vertue to it, by this, if any went to warre, they hoped for protection, and expected victory. What creeping to Crosses vpon bare feete was then vsed in the time of Popery too long it were to number vp their particular superstition in this kinde. These our forefathers liued in a thick mist, in the darknes of Egypt, Ex. 10 21 a darkenes that might be felt, and as Gen. 29. 23. Laban deceiued Ia∣cob in the night, bringing him Leah, which was bleare-eyed in stead of Rahell, who was beautifull and faire; so Satan in the time of ignorance presented vnto them many fowle false gods in stead of the true God which is beautifull out of his holy places: S. Paul
maketh ignorance the mother, and superstition the daughter, when he saith to the men of Athenes; Act. 17. 22 23. In all things yee are too super∣stitious: for in your Altar was written vnto the vnknowne God: but to our vnderstanding which was deafe and dumbe God hath sayd Ephata, be thou opened 1. Sam. 14 27. with Ionathan, we haue tasted a little hony & our eyes are opened: God hath taken from our eyes the skales of ignorance by the finger of the holy Ghost Act. 9. 17. as hee did from Pauls eyes by the hands of Ananiaes▪ and therefore wee must thanke God, who as he commanded 2. Cor. 4. 6. light to shine out of darkenesse 1. Pet. 2. 9 so hath called vs out of darkenesse into his maruailous light. Secondly take heede we doe not (as it is in Iob) Iob. 5. 14. meete with darkenesse in the day time, and grope at noone day as in the night. It is a plague not to see Gods will, but to see, and yet willingly winke, brings a plague without all remedy or compassion. Thou shalt not bow downe to them nor worship them. It seldome times falleth out, but where there are Images in a land, there is also the worshiping of those images: & therefore in the Prophet Esay one followeth in the necke of the other, Esay 2. 8. their land was full of Idolls: then, they worshipped the worke of their owne handes, which their owne fingers had made; our nature is as ready to superstition as wood to take fire, and therefore God hauing mentioned the making of Images and their variety, pre∣sently mentioneth the bowing downe vnto them and worship∣ping them. Pope Stephen the 3. maintaining Idolatry of Images in Christian temples, aduanced their veneration, commanding them to be incensed; here in England were they not wont, to wipe their handes vpon the images, and then to stroke them ouer their faces, as though there had been great vertue in touch∣ing the pictures: did they not rub their beades & hand-ketchers vpon them, light candles to them, aske pardon and helpe of them, did not a company of Pilgrimes licke and kisse a white Lady made of Alabaster in Windesor, whicn image was mor∣trest in a wall behind the high Altar. In the second yeere of Queene Mary, when Bishop Boner, erected the Roode at Pauls, did they not annoint it with Oyle in diuers places, and after the annointing, creepe vnto it and kisse it: did not the whole Quyer in honour thereof sing, Te Deum, and ring out the Bels: and that images might haue the more veneration: this was a fashion beyond sea, as Archbishop
Arundell affirmeth in the examination of Thorpe, when the image-maker should carue, cast or paint an image, hee should goe to a Priest and shriue him as cleane, as if he should then die, hee should take penance, vow to fast and pray, and goe on pil∣grimage; but especially hee should pray the Priest to pray for him, that hee might haue grace to make a faire and deuout image, and therefore considering this abuse, 1 King. 6 27. God would not haue the Cherubins seene, but onely of the high Priest: and Saint Iohn saith, 1 Ioh. 5. 21. Keepe your selues from Idols. The last words of a friend are commonly best remembred: they are Iohns last words in his generall Epistle, like an vltimum vale, and a postscript, Babes kep your selues from Idols: and therefore in reformed Chur∣ches they haue beene abolished: Constontine Emperour of Con∣stantinople, abrogated and pluckt downe images set vp in Tem∣ples; the noble and valiant Zisca conquering in Bohemia, would not suffer any image or idoll to be in the Churches: they were throwne downe at Basill, about the yeere of our Lord 1528, and vpon Ash-wednesday that yeere, all the wooden images there were giuen to the poore of the City to burne: but when they could not agree in deuiding the prey, they being burnt all together in nine great heaps, vpon that Ash-wednes∣day, were consumed to ashes. At the same time or very little before, were they put downe within all the Dominion of Zu∣ricke, though the Bishop of Constance writing to the Senate, what he could in their defence, did stand for their standing. In∣deed Luther much misliked Carolostadius, for stirring vp the people, to cast downe images in Wittenberge, not that he would vphold them; but that he would not haue the people run before the Magistrate, and doe it by force, and considering the time (for Pope Adrian the 6. had then written to the States of Ger∣many, inciting them against Luther, as a fautor of tumults, and supplantor of obedience) hee could doe no lesse to checke this Adrian, then finde fault with proceedings which were without order and authority of the higher powers. Here in England King Henry the 8. Anno 1538, abolished by Iniunction the most notable stockes of Idolatry, as the images of Walsin∣gham, Ipswich, Worcester, Wilsdon, and the like; Afterward downe went their reliquies, shrines, couerings of shrines, writings, and monuments of fained miracles, as being allurements to super∣stition;
downe went the Masse, and downe went the Roodes. But hauing been long in this Laberinth of superstition, and taken view of the manner how it is here set downe, my clew of thred guides me now to the matter; and will bring me out a∣gaine into my accustomed walke. First, therefore for the matter, this commandement mee∣teth with such as make puppets, to counterfait God or any idols for his seruice. Secondly, with such as entring vpon Gods right, are libe∣rall in bestowing his glory vpon them. For the first; when God deliuered his law, Deut. 4. 12. the people saw no similitude, but onely heard the voice of the words, lest if they had seene a similitude, they should goe about to make a resemblance; the fire indeed was a signe of Gods pre∣sence, but such a signe as might testifie vnto them, that his glory was incomprehensible, and therefore might restraine them from making his similitude, which would rather shew the basenesse of their fancy, then resemble the brightnesse of his glory. Iupiter and Mercury were the gods of the Greekes, but when their painters would draw the image of Iupiter in a Table, they were still mending it, but neuer ending it: saying, herein they shewed him to bee a god, for that they might begin to paint, but could not perfit him: Zeuxis about to paint Iune tooke a veiw of the Virgins in Agrigentine; but singled out fiue, por∣traying that which he saw most commendable in any one, but when hee would drawe Venus, hee had before him fifty faire virgins of Sparta, and yet said, fifty more fayrer then they, were not sufficient to counterfeit that goddesse. Therefore when his art could not shadow her, he drew in a Table a faire Tem∣ple, with the doores open, and Venus going in, so as the behol∣ders could perceiue but her backe, if these could not fet out sufficiently, that which was but flesh and bloud, though they had so many helpes to further them, whereunto shall we liken the spirituall God, or what similitude shall we set vp vnto him, Tim. 19. 16. who dwelleth in vnaprochable light, Ex. 33. 23. whose backe parts on∣ly euen Moses himselfe was but permitted to behold: Ioh. 4. 24 God is a spirit, and must bee worshipped in spirit and truth, and therefore wee must haue our mindes thinking on him, not our
eies gazing on his image. False representations to metamor∣phise God, are called Idols, and what is an Idoll? 1 Cor. 8. 4 An Idoll is nothing, there is one note of shame and disgrace, it is worse then nothing: it Deut. 27. 15. is abomination, it is worse then abomina∣tion: 1 Cor. 10 20. it is a diuell: let the Papists therefore (as they did in their common prayer bookes in the Raigne of Queene Mary) figure the image of the Trinity with three faces, let them figure, as in many Church-windowes the Father like an old man, with a long gray beard and a furred robe; his Sonne sitting by him, with a Doue betweene them: those men doe but feed their eies and adore the pictures with dis-honor of God, and iniury to his diuine nature, and is no likenes of God, but onely an imagi∣nation of man.b 1 King. 5 13. Salomon, when hee would build the materiall Temple, ap∣pointed sufficient workemen to lay the foundation, and set vp the whole frame; so when our Sauiour Christ for framing his spirituall Temple, which is his Church; culled out such as were necessary for the bulding of it: Eph. 4. 1 gaue some to be Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Euangelists, and some Pastors, and Tea∣thers: he doth not in this numeration so much as mention ei∣ther Engrauers in stone, Caruers in wood, Painters on walles, or workers in Mettall; therefore let Demetrius the Siluer-smith stand back, let Alexander the Copper-smith beare him company. —procul hinc Zenxis procul esto Licippus. Let not Zeuxis come here with his pensill, nor Licippus with his tooles these may serue for some good vse in ciuill imploiments, but are but cyphers, and must goe for naught in this Arith∣methick. Their cunning workemanship may beguile men, as pigeons were beguiled by the counterfeit, and flew to pigeons painted in the shop, as birds were beguiled by Zeuxis painted grapes; as Zeuxis himselfe was beguiled by Parrhasius painted sheet. The God of heauē seeth without eyes, heareth without eares, walketh without feet, speaketh without mouth; but the gods ofd Ps. 115.  the heathen haue eyes and see not, eares and heare not, feet and walke not, neither speake they thorough their throate: and as the painter may paint a flowre with fresh colour, but not with sweet sa∣uour with this motto: no further then colours; so the Caruer may draw out an image, but not make it draw in the breath with
this motto, no further then fashion. But such was the cunning of the craftests men, the craft of the Priests, the simplicity of the people, that men did thinke, they did see, did heare, did goe, did speake; and therefore in Elyas time, 1 King. 18 26. they called on the name of Baal: saying, O Baal heare vs, and cryed loude as though he had slept and must bee awaked. And in the time of King Henry the eight, when these idolatrous stocks were bro∣ken in peeces, the false iuglings were found out; and the en∣gines espied, which made their eies to open and role about, and other parts of their bodie to stirre; Oh but they bee lay mens books, and where as the Bible to them that cannot reade is as a sealed letter, images be letters patents, they lie open to euery one, are written in folio, that standing a farre off they may reade, they are great capitall letters that running men may reade God, and the very sight of them doth stirre vp a maruai∣lous deuotion in men, women, and children. Indeed this was the cause why Gregory the first, condemning their adoration, yet allowed their presence in Churches tanquam essent memoracu∣la, & rudium literae, as though in them dumbe lectures were read vnto the people, and they might spell God in them. And more then so, Concilium Cenonense agreed on this, that we might learne more in a short while by an image, then by long study and trauaile in the Scriptures; but against these I oppose Ionas, and Habakuk, as of greater authority, of which Ionas saith, Ion. 4. 8. They are lying vanities, not onely for that they proceed from the fa∣ther of lies, but for that, as Habakuck saith, Hab. 2. 18 they teach lies, tea∣ching vs to take the creature for the Creator: a thing of nothing, for that which is infinite; teaching vs to hope where nothing is to be expected. But Idolators grace their Idols with glorious titles, as to say to one, Esay. 44. 17. Thou art my God: Es. 41. 29. whereas it is nothing but wind and confusion: to another thou art my helper, whereas there is no helpe in it, whereas they are all such gods as Virgill saith, Aeneas brought from Troy, which hee calleth vanquisht: —victosque Penates: But let it be granted, that images are lay-mens bookes, yet because they are not allowed but prohibited; who dare print them for the seruice of God, or who dare keepe them contrary to Proclamation, and not rather say of them, as Iudah of
Thamar: Gen. 38. 24. bring ye her forth, and let her bee burnt. Let God him∣selfe appointe how he will be serued, let it be mans part to be ruled by his direction. I reade of a great man, I thinke it was Manlius, who sending his sonne to warre against his enemy, gaue him a com∣mission, by vertue whereof hee was charged what to doe; when and where to set vpon the enemy; but the sonne espying ad∣uantage as he thought, and seeing hope of conquest, if he did borrow a point of the commission, was bold to follow his owne course, and indeed got the victory: but returning home, and expecting great commendation, after his cause was deci∣ded at Rome; he was put to execution. I may erre in some cir∣cumstance for want of memory, but I know, this is the sub∣stance of the story; now our life is a war-faring vpon earth, three mighty campes enuiron vs, the World, the Flesh, and the Infernall forces; if the Greekes bee gone, there is a Sinon within that, will betray them the place; God hath set downe a law, and prescribed vs how wee shall fight, and vn∣der whose colours; he will be our Generall: wee must fight vnder his banner, to serue vnder him in Baptisme: we tooke our presse-mony, if now we seeke many inuentions, and fol∣low other colours, though they bee such, as in our opinion might helpe vs to the obtaining of the victory; yet are we pu∣nishable for breach of obedience. God will not allow these bookes, no not for lay-men, he allows no other books, but the golden booke of grace, Ioh. 5. 39 Search the Scriptures, for they are they which testifie of mee: and the godly booke of Nature, which is bound vp in the three large volumes; 1. the heauens, Ps. 19 1 for they declare the glory of God. 2. The earth, for Ps. 33. 5. that is full of the good∣nesse of the Lord. 3. The sea, Ps. 104. 25. for therein are things creeping innu∣merable, both small and great beasts: Hee that cannot reade in the first, cannot chuse but read in the second, though it were but once printed and neuer since translated; yet all Nations, Lan∣guages, & Tongues must needs read in it; therein euery creature is a letter, euery day a line, euery night a new leafe, neither can any manmetry, any Carpenters chips, any sacred blocks, or puppets of wood, which euery boy can make, after he hath been a while apprentise with a caruer in wood, put vs more in minde of God.
If we would enter into due consideration, then the won∣derfull frame of mans body created by God, in which the bones are the timber-worke, the head is the vpper lodging, the eies as windowes, the eie-lids as casemēts; the browes as pent∣houses, the eares as watch-towers, the mouth as a doore to take in that which shall vpholde the building, and keepe it in reparations, the stomacke as a kitching to dresse that which is conueied into it: the guts and baser parts as gutters and sinkes belonging to the house, compare now this workeman∣ship with that of an image, and happily in the one wee may commende the cunning of the crafts-man; but we doe not mar∣uaile much at his worke, for that we know an other his crafts master, can doe the like, can hew, can carue, can polish, and varnish as well as he. But consider man in whose framing, God is the principall agent, our carnall parents but instru∣ments, and that in framing the baser part onely, that is the body, not the more principall part, which is the soule; for that God created without them; consider that man is not onely a little world, as the world is a great man, but an Epitome; both of God, who is a spirit, and the world, which is a body. Then though we be not like Phauorinus, who maruailed at nothing in the world besides man, at nothing in man besides his minde, (Ps. 139. 14. for wonderfull are thy workes O God, Ps. 104. 24. in wisdome hast thou made them all) yet as most astonished at this worke, which is as Gods text, and all other creatures commentaries vpon it, wee say who is like vnto thee O Lord? none can doe as thou doest. But say, Images are books, and say further, that they are seene and allowed, and that they come forth cum gratia & pri∣uilegio; yet books serue onely to be reade, if they be kneeled vnto and worshipped, if we vow vnto them or bow vnto them, then are they made Idols, and why shall they not then bee bro∣ken in peeces. And indeed so prone we are to idolatry, that our nature is occupied and fixed on those things, which lie before our eyes, rather then on those which are not seene: and then our inward wits bee most feruent, when our outward senses bee least troubled, and therefore let true religion labour as much to take away these blockish books which are so much a∣bused, and which doe so much steale away our hearts, as Pa∣pistry tooke paine to pull away English books, and (thrusting
on Christians for a benefit, which the Esay. 28. 11. Lord laid on the Iewes for a punishment) to ouershadow with mists and darknes the sunshine of the word, making it appeare like sack-cloth, which seene, read, and preached, is able to carue the true image of God in our hearts. I speake not this, as though images and pictures might not be made, to represent man, or any other creature; but we must not make them to our selues, or set them vp for any deuotion to worship God by them. The beginning of Images, was nimius amor amicorum, nimi∣us timor tirannorum; too much loue of friends: and so Ninus King of Assyria; some 2055 yeares before Christs incarnation: caused the image of his disceased father Belus to be drawne; thereby to keepe his countenance better in remembrance; so Xenophanes, among the Egyptians; after his sonne was dead, caused his image to be made for his comfort; and so farre the image is tollerable. But when that which at first was taken only for solace, grew at length vnto holynes, and the seruants tho∣rough flattery adorned it with garlands, and in continuance of time worshipped it as God; then was neither it, nor the like suf∣ferable, but to be plucked downe; as 2. Kin. 18. 4. Ezechias to his great commendation broke in peeces the brasen serpent; though it were commanded to be set vp by God, when the people burnt Incense vnto it, God is the Lord, that is his name, Esa. 42. 8 his glory he will not giue to another, nor his prayse to grauen images, and this brings me into the second part of my subdiuision, to wit, we must not be liberall of another bodyes goods in giuing Gods glory to others. Thou shalt not bow downe to them nor worship them, they must neither haue , nor , neither the greatest, nor the least honour, we must neither ow the body nor bend the soule vnto them: In Elyas time, God acknowledged none for his, but 1. Kin. 19. 18. they which bowed not the knee to Baall; and did not kisse him with their mouthes. 2. Kin. 5. 18. Naaman confesseth this a fault, that he should bow himselfe in the house of Rymmon, and cryes God mercy for that hee shall fall into it: Dan. 3. 18 The three children Sidrach, Misach, and Abednego, will not vse any reuerence with bodily gesture in falling downe and worshipping the golden image which Nabucadnezzar set vp.
The image of a Prince, is then honoured when his person is absent, but a man doth not turne to and worship the image in presence of the Prince: Now God filleth all places, and wee may say of euery place as Iacob of Bethell, Gen. 28. 16. Surely the Lord is in this place, and therefore let his image alone. The workeman is euer better then the worke, as, Heb. 3. 3. hee that buildeth the house, hath more honour then the house: now Psa. 13. 5. 15 the images of the eathen; are siluer and gold euen the worke of mens handes: Ba. 6. 45. Carpenters, and Golde-smithes, make them, neither be they any other thing; but euen what the workeman will make them, neither is there any grace in the image that comes not from the Caruer. If now the workeman be better then his worke, which he graceth or disgraceth at his pleasure; and no man boweth to the workeman, why then should they kneele to the worke of his handes? If any handy worke were to be worshipped, it were the worke of Gods handes; eyther man, Psa. 8. 6. 5 for he hath put all things vnder his feete, or Angels for he hath made them superiours to man: But Peter Act. 10. 25 tooke vp Cornelius when he fell downe at his feete, and shewed to much reuerence as though Peter had been a God, and Act. 14. 14. Barnabas and Paul renting their clothes, tooke vp the men of Lystra more roundly, when they heard they would doe sacrifice vnto them, and the Angell sayd vnto Iohn; Reu. 19. 10. See thou doe it not, when he fell before his feet to worship him: The di∣uell indeed would purchase at a great price, that which men and Angels refuse, being giuen vnto them, and as Caffrani a people in India, worship diuels in most terrible figure; beleeuing that they are permitted of God to punish or spare them at their pleasure: And as in China they put the diuels picture before a sicke man, that he may learne to know him in another world, and take him for his friend, so the diuell would haue Christ, fall downe and worship him, and to bring this to passe; he makes him large offers: (but he cuts large thongs in another mans hyde) he promiseth him Kingdomes, to see if an omnia dabo; will bring him on his knees: Mat. 4. 9. All these will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me, of which wordes Gorran saith pretily, Bene dicitur, (cadens adoraberis) quia nunquam sine casu diabolus adoratur, he saith well, when he saith if thou wilt fall downe and worship mee, for the diuell is neuer worshipped without a shamefull fall: Heathen men did reuerence the Sunne and the Moone and the
Starres. But God, (Gen. 1. 16. though these were his creatures) Deu. 4 19 will not allow them any part of his worship, the Sun is a seruant, the Moone is an hand-mayde, the Starres are made for mans vse? What is more vnseemly then that the sonnes of God should worship the Sun which is the seruant of the whole world? If we may not worship the creatures themselues, which are Gods handy worke, much lesse may we serue the shadowes of those creatures, prepared by art to resemble the Creator; Neither their matter, which make the best of it, is Ex. 20. 23 but golde and siluer, neither the forme which is but the skill and draught of the Crafts-man: say there may be an historicall vse in payn∣ting the images, as the West Church vsed images as Ornaments and Monuments for the ruder sort thereby to learne the liues and death of ancient and vndoubted Martyres, yet is it no piety to worship the picture, say it may be vsed for remem∣brance, for religion it may not. Deu. 19. 14. It was a great fault to re∣moue the land-marke, Deu. 27. 17. there is a curse vpon him that doth it, but they which transgresse the boundes of their duty in seruing Idols, Hos. 5. 10 are like them that remoue the marke, and though a stone might be set vp to bounde ground from ground, yet if a∣ny imagery were wrought in it, if it were consecrated, if men putting religion in it, worshipped God in the stone, Leu. 26. 1. then it was forbidden: God is a husband, the Church is his spouse, the one must performe that office in faith, which the other in flesh, the desire of the woman must be to her husband, the appetite of the Church must be vnto God: when Serapion in time of perse∣cution for feare of death offered sacrifice to an Idoll, the faithful being there with offended put him out of the congregation, and gaue him ouer to Satan; If sedition arise among any people, and the contagion thereof spred it selfe far and nigh, only the ring∣leaders and chiefe doers are punished, but if inhabitants of at Deu. 13. 13. Citie be drawne to idolatry all the inhabitants must be slaine with the sword, and though women are the weaker vessels, and therefore more to be borne withall, yet in this case Deu. 17. 5. the woman as well as men must dye the death. God would not suffer the Iewes to make themselues any other King to rule ouer them, then such a one Deu. 17. 15. as should come out of the bosome of the Church, that true religion might be maintained among them: The Israelites must bring their offring
to the doore of the Tabernacle, Leu. 17. 6. 7. and the Priest onely must of∣fer the beasts, that this way the people might be bridled; that they did not lay themselues open to diuels. Nū. 33. 4 God did execute his iudgements vpon the Gods of Egypt, which maketh for the commendation of true religion, lest the children of Israell should encline to the superstition of other na∣tions. The Countrey, and the house of Laban was stuffed with su∣perstition, God therefore saith vnto Iacob Gen. 31. 13. I am the God of Be∣thel, to teach him to walke religiously in the midst of an idola∣trous generation. If it should be said, God is in this world, we being carnall would fasten him to a pillar or mountaine, and therefore that we might passe beyond our fantasies Iob. 22. 12 Elypbaz saith, that God dwelleth in heauen. Ios. 24. 15 Ioshua bids Israell make choise of him, whom they will serue; and shewes his owne resolution, that if afterward they should follow Idols, it might turne to their shame; since they had bound themselues, to serue the Lord with their owne consent. The distrustful man preferring his fiue wits, before the foure Euangelists, will not beleeue God vpon his word, and there∣fore Iob. 17. 3 God must get some other creditor, except hee leaue a pawne with him, but the Idolater is worse then hee, for the one doth not honor God, but the other sets vp an other God against him. A fountaine hath water in it selfe, and hath no need to re∣ceiue it from other, but giues it to other: a cesterne hath no water of it selfe, but remaineth empty, except there bee some brought vnto it from some other place: A fountaine from whence water springeth naturally is not dried vp, but let o∣ther drinke of it, yet it still sendeth out little streames; but take water out of a cesterne or pit, the more yee take, the lesse it hath, and at length it will be cleane empty. A fountaine still sendeth forth fresh water and healthfull, but let cisterne or pit∣water stand a while, it stinkes and is vnwholsome, God is a fountaine of liuing waters, Ier. 2. 10. 11. &c. Idols are pittes euen broken pittes that can holde no water, God therefore maruaileth, as at a thing that was neuer seene before, that his people should change
the one for the other, and in stead of him, serue Idols which did not profit them, but turned to their owne decay. Nū. 35. 2 When the other Tribes had their portion, each Tribe by it selfe, the Leuits were scattered in the land, that keeping watch and ward, they might see that no superstition crept in a∣mong the people. God would haue all the Inhabitants of the land of Canaan rooted out. One reason was lest Israell ioyning with them, might depriue themselues of the lawfull inheritance, which God had appointed for them. An other reason, lest those in∣credulous Nations the Amorites, Canaanites, the Hittites, and the rest should pollute the land: but a principall reason was, Ex. 34. 11 lest they should allure the elect people of God to the worship of false Gods, and to the busying of themselues in their doting fancyes. This serueth to rebuke the Papacy, which euen from the Alpha to the Omega thereof, is nothing but errour and supersti∣tion: it serueth to reproue Iulian, who ordained that no Chri∣stian might take degree in Schoole, keepe lecture, read any art, or be admitted to study, vnlesse he did worship the Idols: to reproue wicked Hest. 3. 9. Haman, who in a manner offereth all his goods to satisfie his lusts, and vphold Idolatry, when he would not haue giuen a dodkin to the seruice of God: To reproue some people of Affricke, who worship that which they meet first in the morning; supposing the same for that day to be their God: to reproue the Assyrians, who worshipped as many gods as they had Townes: To reproue the Persians, who had as many gods as there were Starres in the skie: to reproue Alex∣ander, who hauing subdued the Persians made men worship him as god: to reproue the Saracens, who sacrifice in mount Mecha to Abraham, Isaac, and Saint Thomas: to reproue the Aegyptians, who besides their other gods, deified their King Apis, forbidding all men vpon paine of death, to say he was a man: to reproue that Councell of the Greekes at Frankeford, who said, that he, that feareth God, adoreth an image as hee would the Sonne of God, with that worship which is due to the Originall: to reproue Orphey, Homer, and Hosiodus, who first brought gods into Greece, and did set downe their peti∣grees in writing, giuing them names and sir-names, and ap∣pointing
them honours at their pleasures. Againe on the contrariside, this serueth for the commenda∣tion of Iacob, Gē. 35. 4. who in token of detestation buried the Idols vnder an Oake, for the commendation of Moses, Ex. 32. 20 who grounde the golden Calfe vnto pouder; for the commendation of Py∣thagoras, who condemned Orphy, Homer, and Hesiodus, for their so damnable diuices; for commendation of Charles K. of France, who aboue 800 yeeres agoe called a great Synod of the Bishops of France, Italy, and Germany at Frankeford, where the second generall Councell of Nice, which two yeeres be∣fore decreed it lawfull to worship images, was reiected and re∣fured; for commendation of that Synod in Greece, where 330 Bishops at Constantinople condemned reuerencing of images. Zac. 10. 2 For they speake vanity, and Ion. 2. 8. they that waite vpon lying vani∣ties, forsake their owne mercy; and therefore Ex. 23. 24 God will haue them vtterly ouerthrowne, and will not haue vs serue them, ei∣ther in praying to them, in Canonizing them, or swearing by them; not in praying to them, for when the faithfull speake the best they can for themselues without boasting, they say, Ps. 24. 20 they haue not held vp their hands to a strange God, and how could the heathen blaspheme the true God more, then to wor∣ship false gods with prayer, when they had dedicated their Temples vnto them, and to say, as they did to Iupiter, Whe∣ther thou bee god or goddesse, wee call vpon thee? Oh but experience sheweth, that prayers vnto images haue beene happy for suc∣cesse, and haue been so farre from comming weeping home, that they haue laden our heads with a blessing, they haue been as a key to open the locke, when God hath shut out his mer∣cies from vs; yea but they are but fabulous legends which the papists alledge in this kind. Indeed I read, that in the time of King Henry the fixt, there came from Barwicke to Saint Albones a begger with his wife, both affirming that he was borne blind, and being warned in a dreame to seeke Saint Albon for his eyes, he was as he said; come thither, the Saint at first lent but a deafe eare to his prayers, but at length at his shrine hee recouered his sight, a miracle was solemnely ronge; Te Deum song, and what more talked off in all the Towne then this miracle? What say you now, is it not well done to bestow some part of our time in a
set course of prayer to Saints, to bee clyents to them, that they may be helpers to vs? I answer, bad dealing hath many times steps whereby it may be traced out. Iulius Caesar conueied 3000 pound weight of pure gold out of the Treasury in Rome, and laid in the like weight of copper gilded, but this was bewraied by the touch: Lysander pickt a great summe of gold, out of the bottome of a bagge (for the mouth was sealed) and sewed it skilfully vp againe, but this theft was discouered by a Bille still remaining in the bagge: this begger plaid the dissembling roague, and his dis∣simulation was espied by his owne confession: for Duke Hum∣frey, then Lord Protector going about to perswade him, that he could not see, the beggar, to proue his sight good, told him the names of all the colours that could be shewed him, which he could not haue done, except hee had knowne them before (though hee might see the colours were diuers) no more then the names of all the men that he should sodainly see. If such vertue be in the Saints, as they fabulously suppose, then in perplexity, what need the superstitious man vse old wiues, and Starres for his Counsellers, he may aske counsell of of the Saints, as Hos. 4. 12 Israell did at their stockes, and at their stickes? in danger, what need his night spell? the Saints may bee his garde; in sicknesse, what need he charmes? the Saints may be his phisitions: what need hee Paracelsian characters for his tooth each? a word to Saint Apolline is present reme∣dy: then what need hollowed waxe as an Antidote against all euils, when seuerall Saints can in counter seuerall euils; if men doe but pray vnto them? nae then let ordinary meanes for any griefe bee set apart, let not him that is troubled with the falling sicknesse, vse any longer to eate the flowers of Ro∣semary, crums of rye bread, and hony meddled well together, for Saint Cornelis (though he carries a recept but for one cure) can helpe that euill, if hee doth but pray vnto him. But these are all but fopperies, and wicked superstition, haue any of these, which promise great helpe, approued their skill to their credulous patients? I say of them, as Iob doth of his friends; Iob. 16. 2 Miserable comforters are yee all, they know not, what particular miseries men vpon earth are intan∣gled and clogged with, how then can they cure them? but
say, that some sicke and diseased haue recouered after pray∣ers made vnto Saints (as Lewis the French King, beeing so sicke, that some supposed hee was dead, after prayers made by the Bishoppe of Paris and others there present, and af∣ter Queene Blanch his mother had blessed him, with a peece of the holy Crosse; began with a sigh to plucke too his armes and legges, and so stretching himselfe began to speake.) I say againe haue not many sicke mended with their phisicke in their pocket? I know where a sicke patient sent to a phisi∣tion for his councell, the phisition wrote downe a Recipe in a peece of paper, and sent him word hee must take that to doe him good: the simple Patient hearing hee must take that, not thinking of the contents, did eate vp the paper, and shorte∣ly recouered his health, but what was it that wrought his re∣couery, was it his Receit? or was it not rather his conceit? or was it not rather strength of nature in the Patient: (though I know a conceit may doe much) rather then any vertue in the one or in the other, so it may bee some haue mended af∣ter they haue been at Saints shrines, but hath this come to passe by vertue in the Saint, or not rather by the power of God, who healeth all our infirmities; I know a Saint many times had the thankes. And as that man in the Gospell wasr Ioh. 7. 23 to offer vp vnto God euery member he had, because hee had made him euery whit whole, so men were commonly wont to offer eares of waxe to the Saint, who (as they supposed) cu∣red the eares, eyes of waxe to the Saint that cured the eyes, feete of waxe the Saint that cured the feete, though it bee onely God, who giueth medecine to heale the sicknesses, and ease the griefe 2 Cor. 1. 4. who is ready to comfort vs in all tribu∣lation, and not the Saints, whom therefore we must not wor∣ship with any adoration. If they cannot helpe the body, much lesse can they cure thet Mat. 4. 2▪ soule to cure this our Sauiour Christ vsed sundry sorts of medi∣cines, as dyet, in his forty daies fast, Electuary, Mat. . 26. in giuing his bo∣dy and bloud at his last supper; Sweat, Luc. 22. 44. which like droppes of bloud trickled downe to the ground, Potion, Mat. 27. 48. when they gaue him vineger to drinke mingled with gall, Ioh 19. 34. letting blond, when they peirced his hands and his feet, and when Longinus, thrust a speare into his side, and strocke his heart veyne, by his natiuity,
he made himselfe in case able to worke this cure, by circumcisi∣on he entred bond for it, by bloud at his passion he performed it. Bloud is a great comfort to nature, and hasteth thither where is most neede of succour, when a man blusheth, it goes to the face, when he is afraide to dye it goes from the face to the heart to comfort the heart, because it is distressed, and when we which are members of Christ were as good as dead, it came from the head to the members, for Reuel . 5 he washed vs in his bloud, and therefore the Church of God may be called Aceldama, be∣cause it is a field purchased by the bloud of Christ, and there∣fore we pray his bloud be on vs and our children, not as the Iewes prayed, Mat. 27. 25. his bloud be vppon vs to reuenge it, but his bloud Reu. 1. 5. be vppon vs to wash vs, 1. Pet. 1. 19. to redeeme vs, Heb. 9. 14 to sancti∣fie vs. Leuit▪ 25. 10. The yeare of Iubily was a figure of Luc. 4. 19 that acceptable yeare, and Mala. 4. 2 the Sonne of righteousnes reioycing as a Gyant to run his course caused this yeare, by him the brightnes of heauen is opened vnto vs as the light of the day is conueyed vnto vs by the Sun in the firmament. He was that Doue which after the floud of our sinnes brought a branch of Olyue, that is peace, andi Gen. 8. 1 mercy to the Arke, that is the Church, in the euening and end of the world. The world is a sea, death is a hooke, Christ is that fish, Mat. 17. 27. in whose mouth was found a peece the price of our redemption, the tribute is payde and wee are de∣liuered, Num. 16. 48. Aaron stood betwixt the liuing and the dead, Moses be∣twixt God and the people, and 1. Tim.  5. Christ is a mediator betwixt God and vs: A mediator, one that dealeth priuately for vs, he is more then so, 1. Ioh. 2. 1 an aduocate, one that comes to the barre in our cause; 2. Cor. 5. 19. he is a reconcilation, one that in such sort dealeth betwixt God and vs, that he will not punish vs, he is more then so, 1. Io. 2. 2. he is a propitiation, one that dealeth so with God for vs, that he will reward vs, this latter is more then the former, for King Dauid is appeased toward Absolon by meanes of Ioa, af∣ter he had slaine his brother Ammon, but 2. Sam. 14 24. 33. yet let him see my face no more there is reconciliation, but in the end he commeth to the King and r the King kisseth him, there is propitiation: as he is a mediator an aduocate, a reconciliation, and propitiation; so is he our only mediator, or only aduocate, our only recon∣ciliation,
our only propitiation, he is the only high Priest which entred before the Arke, where was the signe of Gods presence, when all other were forbid to come neare, the Heb. 7. 23 one Priest who by Heb. 10. 12. one sacrifice Heb. 9. 28 once offered, hath reconciled God to vs. And vs to know the originall cause of our death and damnation we must not range, beyond the fall of the first Adam, for by him sinne entred into the world and death, by the meanes of sinne, so to find our recouery we must not seeke elsewhere then in the second Adam Christ Iesus, for thorough him saluation is conuey∣ed from the Father to all his liuing members, as through the veynes, life is conueyed from the heart to all the vitall parts. Ioh. 14. 6. He is the way, the Kings high way to heauen, we haue no whi∣ther to goe but to him, nor no other way but by him, no man can ascend but by him that did discend, Gen. 28. 12. he is Iacobs ladder, there is no other hy whom we can goe vp vnto God, no build∣ing without this stone, no perfume without this balme, no Pa∣adise without this tree, no God without this Christ, no entrance nto heauen without this dore, no sauing from the floud without this Arke; he is the only Luc. 10. Samaritan that powreth in Oyle to cure our woundes, the only rocke Gen. 35. 14. which Iacob an∣nointed with Oyle, and erected vp for a title of peace betweene God and men, the only vessell full of Oyle, wherewith, 2. Kin. 4. 7 with the widdow we must all pay our debts. Mat. 1. 25 Iesus is his name, Act. 4. 12. and there is no other name vnder heauen whereby we can be saued, and therefore he is not only called a sauiour but Luc. 2. 30 saluati∣on it selfe, because he is the only Sauiour, as for Saints they are no such sauiours as can cure our euils in body, their letting bloud cannot ease the plurisie of our soules, and therefore as that man in the Gospell was to worship Christ because Ioh. 7. 23. he had made him whole euery whit, so on the other side are not wee to worship Saints because they can not make vs whole any whit. The Church of Rome then is to be reproued, which wor∣shipp the Virgine Mary their Patronesse and Protectresse, desiring her to exhibit to them the breast of her grace (great babes▪ to sucke our Ladyes breast) attributing their happy estate to the helpe of her medecine, acknowledging themselues seruants of her owne inheritance and of her peculiar dowre, much such stuffe may we find in the Catholicke Primer called
our Ladyes mattens, & in our Ladyes Psalter made by Bonae∣ture, to be sayd and song in the praise and seruice of our Lady, which make her an aduocate pray for the people, intreate for the Cler∣gie, make intercession for the deuout woman-kinde. Which make her not only blessed her selfe but a giuer of blessednes to others, not a vessell but a fountaine a mother of grace & mercy: Neither shall the Virgin be alone in this seruice, but other Saints shall beare her company, as Saint Nicholas, grant by his merits and prayers we may be deliuered from the fire of hell: as Mary Magdalen: Let her purchase for vs the blisse euerlasting: And as Pilate mingled the bloud of the Galileans with their owne sacrifice, that is killed them while they were sacrificing, and so mingled their bloud and the bloud of the beasts together, so they make their mix∣tures and their medleyes, mingling the bloud of Christ and of their Saints one with another as Beckets bloud, Tuper Thome (sanguinem, quem pro te impendit Fac nos Christe, scandere, quo Thomas ascendit. Thou by the bloud of Thomas (speaking of Thomas Becket) which he for thee did spend, Make vs, Christ to clime, whether Thomas did assend. Thus doe they extenuate the worthines of Christs death, in that they supply the weakenes thereof with the prayers and bloud of their Saints, but as wax and water cannot meete together; so Christ and any thing with Christ cannot meet in the saluati∣on of man; the bloud of Saints defaceth the bloud of our Saui∣our, & the impression of their prayers dasheth out the inscripti∣on of Christ. As for the Saints themselues the Virgine confesseth her Sauiour, and therefore acknowledgeth her selfe a sinner,s Luc. 1. 47. si peccatrix, non depreatrix, qu egebat, non agebat adocatum. Mary Magdale stood behind Christ weeping; she wept, this was ang Lu. 7. 38. acknowledging of her fault, and now she would, that her eyes at which sinne had entred as at a window, might now let it out as at a doore: shee stood behind him, as though shee thought her selfe not worthy to behold him; and againe behind him, that God through Christ might looke vpon her, shall now any stand behind her a sinner, that God thorough her may looke vpon them, or they thorough her may looke vpon God? as for the bloud of Saints, the heart bloud of the best of them could not merit for themselues, and therefore could no more wash
vs from our sins, then 2 King. 5 14. other waters besides Iorden could cleanse the leprosie of Naaman. And therefore hunt not Mar. 5. 2. 3. with the mad Cadarn the graues of the dead, as they did Thomas Beckets tombe, seeke not among the Saints departed for mediators of redemption, no not of intercession. God did not send the King of Gerar, to Noah or any of the dead Fathers, but to A∣braham then aliue and present, Gē. 20. 7. hee shall pray for thee: Indeed Brusierd saith, if wee pray to Saints departed, they, as stricken with some compassion, may say the like to God for vs, as in the Gospell they did for the Canaanite, send her away, for shee cryes after vs: but I answere, if the Saints should haue a feeling of our miseries, then little Mat. 5. 23 would be their ease, small would be their rest, and heauen would be no hauen of happines. An other saith, No man comes to an earthly Prince without ma∣king meanes to some that are about him: but I answer, God respecteth not one person more then an other, and therfore one need not an Atturney, rather then an other to speake vnto God, and therefore dashe out that subscription; which Antonnus saith was vsed in his time, where Saint Paul and Frier Domi∣nicke were painted together, vnder the Image of Saint Paul was written; Per hunc itur ad Christum: vnder the other, sed magis per istum: the like story wee read of King Oswy, who ta∣king vp the matter about celebrating Easter betwixt the East-Churches, which receiued their rite of Saint Iohn, and the West-Church which receiued theirs of Saint Peter, iudged with the West-Church, that is, the Church of Rome, lest (as he said) gainsaying Peter the porter, none should open when hee came to heauen gate, if he were displeased that kept the keys. The prodigall Child did vse no other meanes to come into his fathers house, but Luc. 15. 20. hee himselfe did come to his fa∣ther. As we are not to worship Saints in praying vnto them, so not giuing that honour vnto them, which belongs onely vnto God: vnder the Law God appointed the Iewes three seue∣ralln De. 16. 9. Feasts, the Passeouer, Pentecost, and the Feast of Taber∣nacles; the first in remembrance that God spared their houses, when he slew the first-borne of the Agyptians: the second in remembrance, that God gaue them his Law, 50 daies after their departing out of Aegypt: the third in remembrance that
they dwelt vnder tents and tabernacles forty yeeres in the wil∣dernesse: but after the Idolaters forged Feasts of their owne heads, 1 King. 1 32. as Ieroboam made a new holy day, in honour of the Calues which he had set vp at Dan and Bethel. Vnder the Go∣spell we celebrate Easter, Whit-sunday and other festial daies, the first in remembrance of the death & resurrection of Christ; the second in remembrance of the sending of the holy Ghost, quod abeuntem Christum non amisimus, & vntem Spirit possi∣demus: other holy dayes of Saints wee keepe to the hoour of Christ, and not of them, as the Anuntiation of the virgin, in remembrance that Christ was then conceiued in her wombe; the Purification, in remembrance that Christ was then presen∣ted in the Temple: Saint Peters day as proper to Christ profes∣sed by Peters mouth, Ma. 16. 16. Thou art Christ the Sonne of the liuing God: Saint Iohns day proper to Christ published by his writing, and so of the rest, whose holy daies our Churh doth most piouslyq Io. 21. 24 and religiously bind vs to obserue: but after this, especially within this 500. yeares, the Pope that great god maker of Rome coyned a great number of new holy daies, as the Feast of the Conception of the virgin Mary, which when the Fran∣ciscan or gray Fryers had newly found out in remembrance that she was conceiued without originall sinne, was establish∣ed by Sixtus the fourth, who sent forth his decree, comman∣ding all men to solemnize the said Feast, himselfe adding at the end of her, Aue, & bnedicta sit Anna matertua, de qu sin macula, tua processit caro virginea, and to stoppe the mouthes of the Dominicke or black Fryers, who (taking side with Peter Lombard, Tho. Aquinas, Bernard, Bonauenture, and other Schoole Doctors) taught that it was heresie to affirme that shee was conceiued without guilt of originall sinne, they said, her flesh might well proceede without this infection, for shee was not conceied as others were, and therefore they made a picture of Iachim and Anna kissing, by which kisse Anna was concei∣ued with the virgin Mary. I omi here the feast of her Natiuity, brought in by Innocent the fourth, the Feast of her Assumption, brought in by Leo the fourth, the Feast of Corpus Christi, ordained and confirmed by Clement the fift, who assigned indulgences to those that heard the seruice thereof.
For besides these, that great Saint-maker shrined a rable of blind Saints of his owne creating, prescribing the same to be vniuersally receiued in the whole world, and binging them as holy children of Rome, into his Romish Calender, some with a Fe∣stum duplex, some with a Festum simplex, and celebrating his dou∣ble and simple feasted Saints. He commonly appointed a vigill before them, that they might as well bee honored with a fast, as with a feast; but what were they, that hee did thus digni∣fie, that did fid such place or fauour with him, that they should be canonized and deified, and being set downe in red or blacke colours: should be called vpon for gifts and graces, and be worshipped for Aduocat and Mediators? were they not commonly some Popes, or some rich Bishops, or some fat Abbots, or some blind Fryers, Monks or Nuns, some builders of Monasteries, or such as had stood for the dignities and li∣berties of the papists Church. What made Innocent the third to Saint Fryer Dominicke and confirme his order of Preaching Fryers, but that dreaming that the Church of Lateran was rea∣dy to fall, Dominicke with his shoulders did vnderprop it? why was Thomas Becket, fifty yeeres after his death taken vp and shrined for a new Saint, made of an old rebell; but that hee died for the ambitious liberties of the holy Church? had not that deformed Gilbert of Smpringham in Lincolneshire, erected many Monasteries 13 to the dossen, he had neuer been numbred in the Catalogue of Saints, neither would Pepe Innocent him∣selfe haue made that blasphemous Collect in his honour, where∣in he prayeth that we being succoured by his suffrages may be deliuered from all diseases of our soules. I will not here rehearse any more particulars, lest the rea∣der should blame me as much, for stuffing my paper with this route, rifraffe and rablement of Saints, as I doe find fault with the Pope, for placing them in his Calender. Hee that will know more, may find them dispersed in Pantaleons Chronogra∣phie, and in the Acts and Monuments of the Church, onely this: the yeere was cumbred with so many idle holy daies, and the Calenders with so many raskall Saints, some of them as good as euer were they, that put Christ to death; that Simon I slip (though hee were made▪ Arch-bishop of Canterbury, by the Pope, to wit, by Clement the sixt) by his letters patent dire∣cted
to all Persons and Vicars within his Prouince, straitly charged them and their Parishioners vnder paine of Excommu∣nication, that they should not abstaine from bodily labour vpon certaine Saints daies, which before were wont to be hal∣lowed and consecrated to vnthrifty idlenesse, afterward were more put downe by Iniunction, in the Raigne of King Henry the eight. Concerning those therefore that are departed, let our re∣membrance of them shortly depart after them: Varr thinketh that death was called Iethum , that is, forgetfulnes, because they which haue now forgotten all the world, should soone be forgotten of the world: on the one side, if they were bad, doe not so much as bring forth thy teares vpon them, they of the Kings stocke, in the Prophet Ieremy, shall not la∣ment Iehoakim; saying, Ier. 22. 18 Ah my brother, neither shall they mourne for him, saying, ah Lord, or ah, his glory, let him that liues without loue, dye without teares, without piety, except we say, it was pity, he died no sooner. Againe if their liues were black, doe not we paint their sepulchers with white colours: yet withall, if any good inch were in them, disdaine wee as much to derogate any thing from them, as we would scorne to robbe an Hospital: set not thy foote on a carcasse, scourge not a dead man, fight not with a shadow; bee not like the dogs, which bite the stones cast at them, when they cannot touch those that hurt them. The Papist findeth in his Masse to pray for the dead, but not to play vpon them; fie vpon Pope Stephen the sixt, whose lightning being kindled against the dead, tooke vp the Carkasse of his predecessor Formosus out of the graue, brought it to iudgement before a Councell of Bishops, spoiled it of all Papall robes, cloathed it with a lay∣mans garments, endited it, arraigned it, condemned it, cut off three fingers of it, and cast it into the Riuer. On the other side, if they which are diseased were good men, take vp a lit∣tle while Dauids Lamentation for Ionathan, weepe with Saint Ambrose, both because they are gone before thee to glory, and because the Church hath lost such labourers in the vineyard; but let sadnes bewray rather a tender then deiected minde, and let the felicity wherein they are now placed exchange the sorrow of thy losse into reioycing of their gaine, commending
the vertues that were in them, breake a boxe of spikenarde a∣mong others, and fill their eares with some part of that sweet perfume which they left behind them, praise thē when as good sea men they are come to the hauen, when as good warriours they are come to the triumph: lastly if thou hast Phil. 4. 8. 9. learned and re∣ceiued & heard, and seen in them, (that I may vse the Apostles words) any thing that is true, honest iust pure, pertaining to loue, and of good report, praise God for it; thinke on it, and imitate it in thy selfe, follow their good cts in thy liuing, as they followed Christ in their liues: Honoramus eos charitate non seruitute, saith Saint Augustine, giue therefore vnto the Saints thy teares, giue them their praise, giue them the honour of imitation, lesse thou canst not giue, more thou maiest not, and more doe they not desire, No∣lut enim fic honorari a nobis &c. Lastly wee are not to communicate Gods worship with Saints in swearing by them, for herein we make them not so much lower then God, as God hath made vs lower then Angels: hereby wee confesse their wisdome, their iustice, their pow∣er; see all this in one oath of the Romaines, among whom this was a custome, he that swore, held in his hand a stone, say∣ing: The City with the gods thereof being safe, so Iupiter cast mee out of it, if I deceiue willingly, as I cast from mee this stone. Heere they attribute vnto Iupiter wisdome, acknowled∣ging that he seeth the secret conceit of the heart, their deceit, and whither their deceit be a willing deceit; 2. power, that he can, and 3. iustice that hee will punish their periury, if they sweare not in truth: and therefore God threatneth, that they shall fall, and neuer raise vp againe (which was 1 Sam. 4. 18. old Hely his fall): Amos 8. 14. which sweare by the sinne of Samaria, that is, by the Idols, which the Samaritans worshipped and that say, thy God, O Dan liueth, and he will cut off them, Zep. 1. 5. which sweare by the Lord, and sweare by Malcham; neither might the Iudge admit an oath,y Ios 23.  that any should take by their Idols. Nae the holy Ghost will not haue vs giue so much honour to them, as to mention them with our lippes, and therefore it is probable that Ios. 18. 14 Ki∣riath Baal▪ was called Kiriath-Iearim, that the name of the Idoll might be forgotten and not honoured so much, as with the naming of it, and Socrates in despght of those Heathen
gods did sweare by an Oake, a Goate, a Dogge, as though hee denied lesse godhead to be in those gods then in the least crea∣tures. This serueth to reproue the Turke, whose oath is this, I sweare by God the maker of heauen and earth, and the 4. Historiograpers of Euangelicall Histories, and by the 8000 Prophets that came from heauen, and by our mighty god Mahomet, aboue all other to be worshipped; and by the spirits of my father and Grand∣father, & by this my saced and imperiall head. It serueth to re∣proue Chstans, who by their oathes lay open Gods honour to the spoyle of creatures, and (though it be a thing forbidden by flat statute) beautifie and set our the Saints with the orna∣ments of his name. Let not therefore the name of Saints waite vpon our wores, to serue where our humour shall place them, let vs not fill our mouthes with them, as though the sentence were not full, if they were left out, let not Oathes by Saint An. by Saint Mary, by Saint George, or other fly at all aduen∣tures and waite at the heeles of euery word; these and other oathes are but custome in the elder sort, imitation in the younger sort, brauery in the rich, necessitie in the poore, no pleasure in them, no profit of them, and sinnes cloathed with no delight or gaine are lesse excuseable euen in the sight of men. As weare not to impart Gods worship with Saints, so not with reliques of Saints, which Clement the 5. thought were to be bad in the highest veneration; Heb. 11. 22. Ioseph gaue commandement of his bones, and Gen. 50. 25. lying on his death bed tooke an oath of the chil∣dren of Israell to carry his bones with them out of Egypt, least (as Chrysostome saith) the Egyptians remembring the goodc Deu. 34. 6 things he had done should vse the good mans body to an occa∣sion of Idolatry, God buryed Moses body the Iewes knew not where, one reason was, left they should bring his carkeis into the land of Canaan, from which he was excluded by the iudge∣ment of God; another reason was that by this meanes, he might meete with all and preuent their superstition, for therefore (saith D. Raynolds) it may be thought, that the diuell, when he did striue with Michaell about the body of Moses, did striue that his body might be reuealed to the Iewes, that thereby they might haue occasion to commit idolatry: when a miracle was wrought at the martyring of Policarpus, the Centuion would
not haue his body deuided, least the remnants of the dead corpes should be worshipped of the people: Indeed if that were true that the bones of Siluester the 2. did cōmonly ratle in his tombe before the death of Popes, (for this they say the rat∣ling of his bones doth portend) then there were some reason why they should be esteemed, but his bones are vsed like Dice, made of womens bones to cozen a man, and no such ratling indeed, and therefore let this ratling lye be buryed with them. The Israelites must reserue nothing of the Paschall lambe, lestd Ex. 12. 10 they should mixe that holy banquet with their daily bread, 2. lest the sight of raw flesh might make it lesse esteemed, 3. lest any superstition might creepe in by reseruing the reliques, and therefore the very bones must be burnt, and more then so, Ex. 32. 20 Moses tooke the sinne of Israell and the calfe which they had made, and grounde it to powder, and strowed it vpon the wa∣ter, and made the children of Israell drinke of it, both in despight of their idolatry, and that there might remaine no monument thereof, lest they which were most giuen to superstition might gather together the reliques. This serueth to reproue such, as while they liue, appoint or obserue any festiuall day in honour of reliques, as Pope Innocent, who ordeyned the feast of the holy speare, and of the holy nayles; and though we doe well to obserue the seuenth day, that thereby we may learne to rest from sin that day, and make the rest of the weeke sutable to the same, yet to make more reckoning of one Sabboth then another in regard of reliques, and to haue our Gaudees and feasts on relique Sunday, as they call it, cannot be without sent of superstition: Againe it reprou∣eth such, as when they dye thinke reliques will helpe them the sooner to heauen: as those which are of this minde, that if they be buryed in a Gray Fryers frocke, the third part of their sinnes shall be forgiuen them, which dignity was indeed granted by a Bull to that religion. But neuer thinke that these, nor Saint Peters Cope or his other vestiments can be a quittance for our debts, they are pallium breue, not talaris tunica, a short cloake, not a gowne long enough to hide our sinnes, only the coate of Christ without seame can couer them all: Esa. 43. 25. I, euen I, am he that putteth away thine iniquities for mine owne sake, where euen as God excludeth all other motiues, when he saith for mine owne sake, so
he excludeth all other meanes when he saith, I, and that with an ingemination, euen I doe it. He hath grace, if we sinne, Eph. 2. 7. riches of grace if our sinnes be great, exceeding riches of grace, if they be many: 1. Tim. 1. 13. mercy for Paul, for he did it ignorantly, Psa. 51. 1. great mercy for Dauid, for he sinned willingly, he can pardon, for his mercy is omnipotent, he will pardon, for his omnipotency is meryfull, as for reliques they come short of his mercy that remitteth sinnes, and come not neere the value of that ransome, which was payd for them. The Masse, wherein is consecration, transubstantiation, missall oblation, and adoration, is a great Idoll, and should haue as little worship as these reliques; much vertue (as I haue already shewed) was attributed to it, whereas in very deed there was no vertue in it, it could not so much as defend it sa∣crificer who in some place of this land in the reigne of Queene Mary was beset with Swordes and Bucklers, lest hee should be disturbed in his missall sacrifice, to blame also therefore were they which did flye to it for succour: neither did men thinke it only present helpe for themselues, but if their pigges were sicke, they had a Masse called the Masse of Saint Anthony to ridde them from their diseases, another for their Hennes that were sicke and lost: againe to blame were men to vse it for the conuersion of those which were thought heretickes, as did Anthony Kechin Bishop of Landaffe in Queene Maryes dayes: to vse it for deliuering of soules out of purgatory as did Odilo Abbot of Cluniake, who thought that his Masses had deliuered diuers soules from thence, saying more ouer that he did heare the voices and la∣mentations of diuels crying out, for that the soules were taken from them by the Masses & Dirges funerall: by reason where∣of Pope Iohn the 19: brought in the feast of all soules. Againe to blame were they to vse it, and offer it vp as a sacrifice for remis∣sion of sinnes for the quicke and for the dead: Besides to blame was Vrban the 4. to appoint festum Eucharistia in honor of it: last∣ly to blame were all they, who did vse to sweare so often by it, that custome being almost turned into nature, they could scarse leaue it, if all these were to be blamed, then when the Masse with the appurtenances thereof (by reason of Masse-priests) preasing vpon vs Gen. 19. 9. as the Sodomites vpon Lot shall goe about to breake vp the doore of our hearts, and stepping in shall labour
to haue some part of Gods honour, say as l Lt to his sonnes. GetGen. 19. 14. you out of this place; what portion haue yee with the God of Iacob? To your tents, yee cursed broode of an adultrous and Antichristian generation. The Crosse in time of superstition was made as great an Idoll as the Masse, and comes likewise within the compasse of this prohibition, Thou shalt not bow downe to them nor worship them; I will not heere mention one halfe of the miracles which I haue read, were wrought by it: only this, in the Catholicke Primer called our Ladyes mattens, we read this of Saint Laurence, Saint Laurence the Deacon did worke a good worke, for by vertue of the holy Crosse he gaue sight to the blinde &c. But here by the way▪ I will ouerthrow the Catholicke at his own weapon, & 2. Sam. 23. 21. with Benaiah slay the Egyptian with his owne speare, for how could Saint Laurence giue sight by vertue of the Crosse, when as he was dead many yeares before the Crosse was found, for Laurence, Claudius See∣rus, Crescentius, Hippolytus and Romanus were made Martyres, Anno 265. or a little before, and Saint Helen the mother of Constantine first (as they say) found the Crosse Anno 325. which was 60. yeares after he was dead. Besides Ioh. 9. 32 neuer any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blinde besides Christ, therefore could not Laurence doe it by the Crosse, to blame therefore were the Papists to worship the Crosse in praying to it and saying. O God which hast ascended thy most holy Crosse, and giuen light to the darkenes of the world, vouchsafe by the vertue of thy Crosse, to illumine, visit, and comfort both our hearts and bodyes: And againe. All hayle, O crosse, our onely hope, in this time of the passion. Increase thou iustice to the godly, and giue to siners pardon. To blame were they which did appoint festiuall dayes for the celebration of it, as Pope Eusebius, who is sayd to ordayne the feast of the inuention of the Crosse, though it was not found, as some say, till Siluesters time; the next Pope after him, and Ho∣norius the 1. who ordeyned the exaltation of the Crosse to be celebrated, both it feastes, were, and yet are among vs called the two holy Rde dayes; Lastly they are to blame that sweare by it, Ier. 5. 7. for how shall God spare vs for this, if we forsake him, and sweare by Idols, by the Masse, by the Crosse, by them that are no gods? But as some are to blame in attributing to
much vnto the Crosse, so other are to blame in detracting too much from it. Theodosius went too much on the one hand, and was too superstitious, when gathering a Councell together, hee made a Law, that no man should make a crosse vpon the ground, or vpon a marble, or any stone which should bee laid vpon the ground; lest men should perhaps tread vpon it with their feet. The Turke went too much on the other hand, who when he had taken the City of Constantinople, and found there in the high Temple of Sophia the image of the Crucifix, wri∣ting this superscription vpon the head of it, hic est Christianorum Deus, i. the God of the Christians, gaue it to his souldiers to be scorned, and commanding it to be carried through all his Army with a trumpet, made euery man in most contumelious sort to spit at it. In medio tutissimus ibis, it is good to keepe the midway betwixt these two, like Sir Iohn Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, who being asked what honour hee would doe to the holy Crosse, answered (as it is in his examination set downe by Master Fox) if it were his, he would lay it vp honestly, he would only doe it this honour, hee would make it cleane and lay it vp safe: and concerning other Idols, as on the one side there was a fault in Marcellina (whom therefore Irenaus, Epi∣phanius, and Augustine reckoned and detested as an Hereticke) to haue images in her closet, to set garlands on their heads, and burne incense to them: So on the other side there was a fault in the Iewes, who forbad theirs to drinke of that foun∣taine, whose water spowteth out of the image of man or wo∣man, lest that bowing down their head to the water-pipe▪ they should seem to worshp the image, & therefore, they say, Mar∣dochee would not bow his knee before Haman, lost he might seem to worship an image; for they fable, that Haman wore a certaine golden picture about his necke. On this side there was a fault in the Pharisees, the great Masters of Israell, and such as excelled the rest for Piety, for they (as Doctor Hall in a Sermon at Pauls Crosse) taught their disciples, that if in their trauaile an Image were in the way, to fetch about some other way, if they must needs goe that way, to run, if a thorne should light in their foot neere the place, not to kneele▪ but to sitdown and pull it out, lest they should seeme to giue it reue∣rence. The meane is sweetest melody, too much of the best is euil
and excesse in vertue vice, it is no good signe if Nilus ouer∣flow lesse then 12 cubits, or more then 18; there is a measure for Manna, gather not to much, gather not too little; run past the goale, thou art accounted rash, run but halfe way, thou art accounted slowe: goe too much on the one side, thou returnest into Aegypt, goe to farre on the other, thou art carried away to Babilon, the counter poize of the heart is framed by God, like an euen and iust paire of Ballance, turne not therefore to the right hand or to the left: spit not at the Crucifix with the Turke, kneele not to it with the Papists, the one with Zachee is to low, and therefore Luc. 19. 4 must climbe vp, the other with the same Zachee is to high, and therefore must come downe, or else Christ will neuer dine at his house. I will not speake here of their fire, waterincense, wax, bread, wine, the Church, the altar, the Church-yard, Ashes, Belles, Copes, Palmes, Oyle, Candles, Salt, and such like things, which blessed or hallowed were had in too too much estimati∣on, for that then exceeding great vertue was supposed to bee in them, especially in holy-water, which Steucus (as Bishop Iewell affirmeth of him in his Apology) said we did well to hallow with salt and prayers, that by the sprinkling thereof our sins may be forgiuen: neither was it onely auaileable for the soule, but the water of Canterbury like a certaine Panacea, could heale all diseases, as feauers, fistula, gowte, tooth-ach, palsie, consumption, falling sicknes, leprosie, head-ach, broken armes, maimed legs, swelling throtes, with infinite other, like as a cunning smith with one key should open all manner of locks. I need not striue to put downe these, they are so weake that they fall of themselues, ad the miracles wrought by them were said to bee so many, that they loose their owne credit: onely a word or two for confutation of that which is alledged in defence of Idols, and then an end of the Prohibi∣tion. In the Prophet Hosea, Hos. 4. 17 Ephraim is ioyned to Idols: let him alone: if we must let him alone, why then doe you blame those that keep the statutes of Omry, & all the manner of the house of Ahab which sacrifice to Baalim, which haue borne Siccuth their King, & Chilum their Images, & the starre of their Gods, which they made to themselues? I answer, the liberty that the Pro∣phet
Hose giueth vs a permission with indignation, as if a fa∣ther should say to his graceles sonne, when hee seeth that hee hath shaken hands with hell, and standing at defyance with goodnesse proclaimeth open warre to his soule, and will not reclaime himselfe by good admonition, but runs riot like a lawles and awles person, euery day faster then other, because the diuell driues him, sirrha, run your race, take your swinge, sape thy felfe in thy sinnes, giue head to thy lusts, still dance after the diuels pipe, I will warne thee no more, I will let thee alone, see what will come thereof at the last? the like speach concerning the same sinne is that of the Lord: Eze. 20. 39. Goe you and serue euery one his I doll, seeing that yee will not obey mee: the like is that of Salomon, concerning an other sinne: Ec. 11. . Reioyce, o young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth, walke in the waies of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: the like is that of the Angell, concerning all sinne: Reu. 22. 11. hee that is vniust; let him bee vniust still, and hee that is filthy, let him bee filthy still: otherwise when the Lord speaketh simply & plainly he blameth Israell, for that they Ps. 106. 28. ioyned themselues to Baal-Peor, like the arbarian Tyrants, which bound the bodies of the li∣uing to the bodies of the dead, till they rotted together. Againe some say, they worship God in their hearts, though they haue images, the better to stirre vp deuotion, though they kisse these images and bow downe to them, yet they bee not so sottish, but they know, they are but stocks and stones, and therefore as the Grecians said, they would not worship images, lest they should seeme to agree with the Romane Church, but yet they would adore pictures, or rather as Fredericke the Emperour, when he prostrated himselfe in such sort before Alexander the third, that the proud Pope troad vp∣on his necke; said, non tibi sed Petro: I doe not this honour to thee, but to Peter. So say they when they prostrate themselues before an image, non imagini sed Deo, they doe not this honour to the Image, but to God: but this is as if the wife should say, she loues her husband in her heart, but she will haue another man in her house, shee will keepe company with other men▪ when he is abroad, shee will set her eyes vpon them, she will embrace them, but this shee doth not for any loue to them, but that by them, shee might better remember her husband, but this
is to bee like Clodia, who to excuse her incest said, she did com∣pany with Metellus as with an husband, but with Clodius, as with a brother. Thus though euery string be out of tune, yet the Musicke shall not sound amisse, but as Asinus is Asinus, quan∣quam aurea gestit insignia, so this whore is a whore, though shee set neuer so faire a glosse vpon her sinne, and varnish her lewd∣nesse, and in very deed, howsoeuer men sooth themselues in this sinne, yet are they so sottish, that as the Prophet saith, Esa. 2. 8. they worship the worke of their owne hands, with an ingeminati∣on which their owne fingers haue made: otherwise why did they forbid (ne Sanctorum imagines confringantur) the breaking of images, inflicting a greater punishment vpon him that should breake an Image, then vpon him that should rent and teare God in peeces with his carrion and stinking mouth? Why was one Rochus, a caruer of Images, borne in Brabant, bur∣ned at Saint Lucas in Spaine Anno 1545. when he did but take vp a chisell, and dashing it vpon the image of our Lady, did ble∣mish her face; though hee alledged for himselfe, it was his owne worke, and if the workemanship disliked him, what had any man to doe with it? Why were they so wood and so testy with Testwood Anno 1544, as to threaten to kill him, and therefore drew vpon him, and that in the Church at Windsore, but that he vp with his hand in which he had a key, and smiting down a border about an Alablaster Image, which the glance chanced to breake off the nose. When Thomas Bec∣kets Image was set vp at Mercers Chappell in London, in Queen Maries time, Anno 1555, why was there such a great reward promised by Proclamation to him, which could bring newes, who broke away first his two blessing fingers, and afterward struck off his head, but that this and the other images were prized at a greater valew, then they deserued to bee estee∣med. The word of God is comprised in the Bible, yet some∣times the paper thereof is wasted, sometimes for that the trans∣lation disliketh vs, sometimes for that it is old and worne, and this we doe without any exclamation, but let one breake or burne an Image that is worm-eaten by reason of age, or for that it hath been abused: Iam faces, iam saxa volant, furor arma ministrat.
Men rage, as though not a stocke or stone, but a true Saint of flesh and bone should be cast in the fire, which argueth, that they are to much addicted to the image it selfe, and haue it into high a veneration: but what need I light a candle in the sunshine, doe not they themselues write that the image and Crosse of Christ ought to be worshipped with the same honour that is done vnto God; doe they not say, when we salute the Crosse that procured vs life, we doe well to sing, thy Crosse, Lord doe we adore the speare which opened thy sacred and life-giuing side, doe we adore, and that you may not meruaile that men are so farre gone as in such sort to forget themselues, doe you not see that many a man, though he hath a wife like Sarah, of whom Abraham sayd, Gen. 12. 11. thou art a fayre woman to looke vpon, and Gen. 26. 7. like Rebecca beautifull to the eye, yet this notwithstanding, will goe vp to the bed of a deformed harlot, in whose moulding, nature did neuer bestow the like cunning: on the other side, doth not many a woman, though she hath an husband like Ab∣solon, 2. Sam. 14 25. in whom was no blemish, whose personage may seeme to haue stolen away all that nature was able to bestow, this notwithstanding, doth shee not many times couple her selfe with another man, whose countenance, proportion of body, and qualities of minde, are no waies answerable to her owne husbands? If it be thus in man and wife, then maruaile the lesse at this, that the Church of Rome Ier 2. 12. should change her glory, like the Reu. 2. 4. Church of Ephesus, should for∣sake her first loue, and casting off the God of her salua∣tion (who as the spouse saith Can. 1. 15 is beautifull and plea∣sant, fairer then the children of men) should looke to other gods, goe a whoring after them, couple her selfe with them, and breaking her faith like a filthy strumpet, bow to Baall Peor, and separate her selfe to that shame: but let this suffice to haue spoken of the prohibition and negatiue part of this commandement, now to the Iniunction. Men reape as great displeasure by omission of dutie, as com∣mission of iniquity, he is as honest a man that doth nothing at all, as he is a good Archer that neuer shootes at all; & therefore we must not only passe a secret vow in the soule constantly to refraine from Idolatry; but also to performe true and Canoni∣call obedience to God: we must bow downe vnto God, and
glorifie him in our members; we must worship him, and therefore glorifie him in our spirits, God made body and soule therefore 1. Cor. 6. 20. they are Gods, therefore both must pay tribute. Religion is outward, Rom 12. 1 I beseech you therefore by the mercyes of God, that you offer vp your bodyes, religion is inward: and therefore sursum cor∣da, Pro. 23. 26. my sonne giue me thy heart, giue God the heart and the hand, the minde and the mouth, the faith and the feet. This condemneth those that will bow but not worship; Se∣condly those that will worship but not bow; Thirdly those that will neither bow nor worship, and approueth only such as knowing God hath ioyned those two together 2. Cro. 29 29. 30. according to the practise of Prince, Priest, and people will not put them a sunder. The first sort are hypocrites, who will bow their knees, ducke like Fryers, cast vp their eyes, cast forth their hands, but Nemo tam prope proculque Deo, Mat. 15. 8 they drawe neare, and yet are farre off, they are all for sight, nothing for substance, the substance of their hearts is not answerable to the show of their gestures, like Stage Players they represent the persons of those they are not, acting religious parts, but doing nothing else but play de∣uotion, and indeed are little better then diuels wrapt vp in . Sam. 28 14. Samuels mantle, hot meteors shooting, yet shewing like starrs, hauing fowle soules and faire liueries. Let these Gospellers or Gospel-spillers, shaming goodnes by seeming good, Esa. 1. 15. stretch out their hands, God will hide his eyes from them; let them paynt and trim, plaister and white-lime, and as smothly as they can dawbe on this faire complexion, God shall smite these whited wales: God forgiue them their holynes, and grant they may carry themselues, in an honest and simple truth, free from affectation of seeming that they are not, and giue them as well good affections as good gestures, as well a good text as a good glosse, as well the fruites of piety as the blossomes of the knees, and leaues of the lippes. The second sort are a base kinde of carelesse Christians, which regard not how irreuerently they performe the duties of pietie, Iud. 3. 20 with Eglon they will neuer arise to heare the word of God, 2. am. 6. 20. with Dauid they will not be bare headed before the Arke, Mat. 18. 20. with the seruant that feared they will not fall downe, when they pray they care not for kneeling, as subiects to their Prince
nor standing as seruants before their Master, and while they would auoyde the hypocrisie of seeming holy by humbling themselues, they neglect and cast off all care of such comely gestures as might stirre vp deuotion: neuer suffring the inward affection of their soule to appeare by any outward carriage of the body Gen. 17. 3 Abraham fell on his face and worshipped, Act. 7 60 Stephen kneeled downe, Luc. 18. 13. The publican stood a farre off, the first is as he that kisseth the feet of the Lord, the second as hee that kisseth his hand, the third as he that kisseth his mouth, all these gestures are found in one Mary Magdalen, first Luc 7. 38. she went to his feet for the remission of her owne sinnes, then Ioh. 11. 32 to his knees for the raysing of her brother Lazarus, then to his mouth Mat. 26. 7 when shee powred the oyntment vpon his head: indeed when Ioshua fell to the earth and prayed, the Lord said vnto him, Ios. 7. 10. Get thee vp, wherefore lyest thou thus vpon thy face? But it is not for that hee misliked the gesture of his body, but for that hee condemned the excesse of his sorrow, as if he should say, why is thy spirit thus long in perplexity within thee, why is thy heart within thee desolate, why doest thou rowle thy selfe in the dust, and make lamentation like the Dragons, and mourne as the Ostriches, why doest thou forget to eate thy bread? thou hast lyen long and too long vpon the ground to make intercession for Israell, get thee vp, lye no longer, another meanes must bee vsed to turne away my wrath, that I doe not suffer my whole displeasure to arise: otherwise though prayer be the substance, yet gesture is a kind of formality to set it forth, and must waite vpon it, Iudit. 13. 10. as Iudiths hand-mayde doth vpon her Mistresse, when she goeth vnto her prayer. The third sort which neither bow nor worship are playne Atheists, which haue no feeling of Gods loue, no feeling of his feare, whose hardned hearts are as a peece of dead flesh to mat∣ter of religion: Our Sauiour Christ in his Sermon, vpon the mountaine would teach vs to pray priuatly, for there is Mat. 6. 6. 7. Oras in the singular number, and to pray publickely, for there is Oratis in the plurall number, but this man regardes neither priuate nor publicke seruice of God, you shall neuer blame his hypocrisie, for he is so farre from standing in the corners of the street to pray, so farre from saluting one of the pillers of the great Church on one knee, that he neuer worships God with
body or soule in Church or in chamber, or any other place whatsoeuer whether he should pray with the Protestants to∣wards the East, with the Iewes towards the West, with the Saracens towards the South, whether prostrate with Ahraham, kneeling with Stephen, or standing with the Publican, be questi∣ons that neuer trouble his braine: when Gregory Bishop of Rome sent Austen the Monke into this land in the Saxons time to bring this Nation out of darknes into light, Austen consulted with Gregory what forme of diuine seruice he should commend to the Saxons; Gregory willed him to binde himselfe neither to the forme of Rome, Millan, French, or any other Church, but the best and pikedst things to chuse out of all Churches, and them to induce and deliuer to the English: but this man would saue Austen a labour in consulting, and Gregory in resoluing, no ser∣uice is accpeted with him, no religion; Lucian is his olde Testa∣ment, Machiauell is his new: he saith with the Sadduces Mat. 22. 23. there is no resurrection, Act. 23. 8 neither Angell nor spirit, he hath said in his heart, there is no God, no iudgement, no hell, no heauen, this one thing he hath, whereof let him reioyce, he will commit no solecisme in Gods seruice, and be sure that his prayer, Est. 7. 7. 8 like that of Haman, shall neuer be turned into sinne; he is a great deale worse then Agrippa, Act. 26. 28. for hee was almost perswaded to be a Christian, worse then Protagoras, for he did but doubt, de dijt vtrum sint non ausim affirmare, worse then the superstitious man, for better to haue many gos then to haue no god, as bad as the diuell, but that he hath a body; nay in this worse then the diuels, Iac. 2. 19. for they belieue and tremble, Luc. 4. 34 and acknowledge the holy one of God. The fourth sort which (according as they are enioyned by this commandement) bow downe vnto God and worship him, are Ioh. 1. 47 with Nathaniell true Israelites indeed, Ps. 105. 1. which sing vnto God, and therefore they giue him the tongue, sing heartily, and therefore they giue him their soules, fall downe and kneele be∣fore their maker, and therefore they giue him their hands and knees, and with Iacob they will vse some corporall seruice, Gen. 47. 31. who therefore leaned on his staffe and worshipped God, when hee was not able to kneele or stand; if their heart doe beleeue, they say with the young man, Mat. 19. 20. what lacke I yet, their mouth shall con∣fesse their eyes shall waite, their eares shall hearken, their heads
shall be bare, their hands shall be lifted vp, their knees shall bend and Camell themselues before God, they serue God with all their soule, therefore God shall haue all that is within them, they serue God with all their might, therefore God shall haue all that is without them, the former is the substance, the latter is a kind of formality to set it forth; to conclude this point ther∣fore: Ps. 25. 1. Sit cordis intentio, sit manuum extentio, with Dauid lift vp thy soule vnto God, Ex. 17. 11. with Moses holde vp thy hands the preparing of the heart and stretching out of the hands are in Iob Iob. 11. 13 ioyned by God, let them not therefore be sundred in man. I am the Lord thy God: In the fourth yeare of King Richard the 2. when the Rebells had assembled themselues together to the number of more then three score thousand, hauing for their Captaines Wat Tiler and Iack Strawe; the King came in amongst them at a day and place appointed, and speaking vnto them in gentle sort said: Sirs, what ayleth you, ye shall haue no Captaine but me, I, am and will be your King and Captaine be you therefore quiet. In like manner when the heart of Israell was not perfit with the Lord, when the house of Iacob did not giue God his due glory, but following other Gods rebelled against him: when they esteemed that Idoll Sicnth as their King, and tooke vp the Ta∣bernacle of Moloch, when all the people walked euery one in the name of his god, then God came downe amongst them Ex. 19. 11 at his appointed time and place, and giuing them good words said, heare O Israell, what ayleth you, yee shall haue no God but me, yee shall not ioyne your selues to Baal-Peer, nor subiect your selues to your god Remphan nor eepe the statutes of Omri, I am the Lord your God, therefore cleaue vnto me, serue me with gladnes, wash your hands in innocency and so compasse mine altar. The first argument then here vsed to induce obedience, is the loue of God, and this that he saith, thy God, atgueth the contract and marriage betwixt God and his Church according to that in Ezechiell, Eze. 16. 8 I sweare vnto thee, and entred into couenant with thee, and thou becamest mine; God was not ashamed to be called their God, he was as an husband, the Israelites as his spouse, his soule longed for them, his heart did cleaue vnto them, his se∣cret was with them, his beautie was vpon them, his light shined vpon their heads, he did lift vp vpon them the light of his countenance; he did hide them vnder the shadow of his
wings, he did couer them all the day long, vnder his armes they were for euer, he did endow them, and say, all that I haue is thine, goods of grace re, goods of glory spe, the first in present posessi∣on, the second in future assurance. The loue of this Bridegrome to his spouse shall appeare the greater, if we consider her estate and qualitie, first for estate. Men in their matches commonly respect the mending of their meanes, and will looke to this that in tying themselues fast, they doe not vndoe themselues; this makes many roue at a marke wth their thoughts, which is beyond the pitch of their bowe: like 2. Kin. 14. 9. the thistle which in the parable would haue the Cedars daughter maryed to his sonne: but in this match God which is as a Cedar in Lebanon maryeth himselfe vnto a thistle, tantus tantillos, so great a God, so small a worme, as Iacob, he did not therefore respect his owne good, when he made choyse of his Church, that would not enrich him, if there be any good in vs, Ps. 16. 2. our wel-doing extendeth not to him, but he aymed at the good of his spouse, that he might make her free which was bound vnto Satan, for euen in our law, if a freeman marry a bond-wo∣man, she is made free, because her husband and she are one per∣son, and if he doth make her free, then is she free indeed. Againe men in their matches haue an eye to the qualities of those, to whom they intend to contract themselues, whether they be (caeteris paribus) of a milde and gentle disposition, least as meates of contrary qualities digest not well together, so they should be alwayes one sicke of the other. In our land, the Guardein in chiualry shall not mary his Warde in chiualry to one that is vnequall to him, as a bondwoman, the 2. to one that is lame, or the 3. deformed, or the 4. hath some horrible dis∣ease as Leprosie, or the 5. to a woman that is past child-bear∣ing, for it is disparagement, but God ioyned himselfe to Israell when she was bond, for sinne reigned in her, when shee was lame, for Ioshua takes her vp for halting, when she was deformed and Eze. 16. 6. Polluted in her owne bloud, when shee was diseased, for from the sole of the foote vnto the crowne of the head, there was no wholet Esa. 1. 6. part in her, when shee brought forth nothing but sinne vnto death, when Shechem would marry Dinah Iacobs daughter, her brother said Gen. 34. 14. they might not giue their sister to a man vncir∣cumcised, but God espoused Israell, when she was of an vn∣circumcised
heart and lips, and wedded her, which wanted a wedding garment, tantus tantillos, tales, so great so righteous a God made choise of a spouse, betwixt whom whether we re∣spect estate or qualitie, there was great inaequalitie, Iacob louedx Gen. 29. 17. Rachell more then Leah, he had some reason, she was more beau∣tifull, but that God should praefer Iacobs sonnes before the rest of the world, he had no reason but his owne good will, Gen. 34: 25. for two of them Simeon and Leui were treacherous and bloudy men, and the eldest Ruben came not behinde them in another kinde of iniquitie: Gen. 35. 22. for he went and lay with Bilhah his fathers concubine, and what dignity could be in him, who went vp to his fathers bed and defiled it? The rest, they and theirs were a Ps. 78. 8. froward & crooked generation, a generation that set not their hearts a∣right, whose spirit cleaued not stedfastly vnto God, & as Mount Sion was not better then other Mountaines, but more noble be∣cause it pleased God to dwell there, so the Iewes were no better then other, till God vouchsafed to make them his people, be∣cause he had a fauour vnto them, because his good pleasure was such. And this is that which our Sauiour Christ saith, Ioh. 15. 16 yee haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you: he chose them first by predestination, and afterward by calling and culling them out from the rest, but then did they also chuse him by consenting to that calling: of both these mutuall choices doth Moses speake, of the on, Deu. 26. 17. 18. thou hast set vp the Lord this day to be thy God: of the other, the Lord hath set thee vp this day to be a precious people vnto him: now out of this that hath been spoken, conclude as the Iewes did, when they saw manifest tokens of Christs affection Ioh. 11. 36. to Lazarus they sayd see how he loued him, so when you consider the premisses, and see the disparagement, say, see how he loued her, see how great affection he bare to his Church. 1. Io. 4. 9. This must teach vs first, to loue him, because he loued vs first, loue must be reciprocall, and therefore the Bridegroome and the spouse, in that sweete marriage song call one another Lone; secondly, it must teach vs to keepe vs only to him so long as we liue, for if while the husband liueth, the wife shall Rom. 7. 2▪ take another man, she shalbe called an adultresse. Neither doth wife admit any plurality when she is construed with one husband, and therefore it was a kinde of Solacisme when Lamech said, beare ye wines of Lamech, neither doth husband admit any
plurality, when he is construed with one wife, now neither must vnus or vna haue a plurall number, socium de te nesciunt: GodMal. 2. 15. had aboundance of spirit, and might haue made two for one, but he made but one, one man for one woman, one woman for one man, & as the woman hath not power ouer her owne body, either to deny it to her owne husband, or to yeeld it to another man, so neither hath the spouse of Christ: yee are not your owne:1 Cor. 6. 20 for yee are bought for a price, therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your spirit: for they are Gods. we must therefore acquaint our selues with God, as for Idols they are called strange gods, as the harlot is called a strange woman, because they should beMal. 2. 11. Pro. 7. 5. strangers to vs and we should be strangers to them. It is good for me (saith the Psalmographer) to keepe meePsa. 73. 28. fast to God, for there is a nearer coniunction betwixt God and vs then betwixt man and wife, for man and wife are one flesh:Gen 2. 4. but he that is ioyned to the Lord is one spirit: if therefore a wife may1. Cor. 6. 7 not forsake the guide of her youth, and forget the couenant of her God, if her holy dayes must not be feasts of quicunque vult, if she must not turne to vncleannes from her husband, much lesse, may Gods spouse breake her faith, and giuing God sundry companions, bestow his glory on them, she must not bow her knees to Baal, nor kisse him with her mouth. A iealous God: some men being better husbands then Christi∣ans, and better bawdes then husbands, can be content to be panders to their owne beds, Nicholas (the same as most menAct. 6. 5. thinke which was one of the seauen deacons) being blamed for iealousie, brought his wife, who was faire to looke vpon, among all the disciples, giuing free leaue to all that would to vse her, of him came the heretickes called Nicolaite, who held that wiues should be common, whose workes the Church of Ephesus hatedReu. 2. 6. to their great commendation: Abraham is not much displeased that the fountaines be not his only, but the strangers among whō he is, and therefore giues his wife this counsell, say, I prayGen. 12. 13. thee, that thou art my sister, that I may fare well for thy sake: nay his owne silence and his owne wordes are the cause that shee is taken into Pharaohs house to be his wife, for Pharaoh blameth him both for the one, and for the other: for his silence, why saidst thou not, shee was thy wife? for his speach, why saidst thou she was thy sister: hauing great cause to expostulate the matter
with him; for hereupon if God had not kept Pharaoh, PharaohGen. 20. 2. had kept Abrahams wife: neither did he leaue by this, but as though this sinne had been glued to him, and that he did cleane as fast vnto it, as it vnto him, hee stumbles the second time at the same stone: and though a sonne should not iumpe in euery foot-steppe of his good father, and keepe the same pase, and turning in all points as hee doth: (for ego & pater meus in the Oeconomicks is no good plea) though God registers the sinne of the father, not for imitation, but admo∣nition of the sonne, and though the father repents the ill hee did, that the sonne might not doe that which hee repented) yet Isaac the sonne of Abraham, as though God in setting downe his fathers fall had said, tu quoque fac simile, treads in his fathers steps, though hee did tread too much outward, the imitation of his fathers euill did aequall the example, or rather exceed it, as much as the imitation of his fathers goodGen. 26. 7. came short of the paterne. I know the hope of faring well, and the danger which Abraham and Isaac foresaw to bee towards them in strange Countries, if by this meanes they had not preuented it, doth some thing extenuate their fact and may seeme to patronize it: but now a dayes there bee diuers wittals, who though there bee little hope of profit, lesse feare of perill can bee content that their owne bosoms should bee false to them, that others like fed Horses, as the Prophet speaketh, should eye after theirIer. 5. 8. Exod. 8. 3. Gē. 49 14. 1 King. 22. 11. wies, and croke in their Chambers like the frogs of Aegypt; they themselues being but cloakes for the raine, while they smother the fault: the blessing of Issachar bee vpon them let Zidchiah doe the best hee can for them: let these Caf∣frani still father the crale, and with the wood-culuers or filly hedge sparrowes hatch and bring vp, that which cuckows lay in their neasts. Others of a more honest disposition thinke, no iniury on earth can paralell this wrong: they thinke this, that others should haue the same coniunction with their wiues in wicked∣nesse, which they haue in holinesse, and by the appointment of God to bee one of the greatest punishments inflicted by God or man: by God, for it is the first of the two pu∣nishments, when God did gather his lappe full of plagues
to powre vpon Israell for their idolatry: Your daughters shalbeHos 4. 13. harlots, and your spouses shalbe whoors by man; for it was the say∣ing of a great man, when diuers gaue their verdict what iudge∣ment it were best to execute vpon a notable malefactor brought before them, one saying hee should bee whipt at an horse taile, an other that he should be hanged, no, saith hee, I will punish him worse then so, I will marry him to a whore. Men of good minds, and such as haue care of their credits, thinke that if other men should vse their wiues more familiarly then honesty requireth, that if other should gage the vessels, and they should drinke the lees, that if other should gather the grapes, (they should gleane the vine, that if other should haue the entertainement of husbands with their wiues, and they should see the staffe stand at their doores: this staine they thinke to be the greatest blemish that might be to their reputa∣tion, and a reproche which neuer could be put away, & as the woman for her part doth stomacke the matter, when her hus∣band, hauing a wise of his owne, is sicke of a plurisie: And therefore Olympias the mother of Alexander the Great (thoughGen. 16. 3 Sarah for want of children gaue her seruant Hagar into her husbands bosome) wrote vnto her sonne, that he should not ac∣cording to his custome, call himselfe the sonne of Iupiter, lest in so doing Iuno the wife of Iupiter might enuie her, and take displeasure: so on the other side, the husband especially if hee be iealous, cannot digest this villany: Iealousie is the rage of a man, therefore will hee not spare in the day of vengeance; he willPro. 6. 34. seeke his death that doth abuse his wife, and diuorce his wife, that takes her pleasure in dalliance with another man: now God is a iealous God, an husband that cannot abide a partner in his loue, and therefore wee cannot wrong him more, or dishonour him more, then by going aftet other gods, and coupling our selues to them: nae his name is Iealous, andEx. 34 14. thererefore in any case he cannot away with a Riuall, and there∣fore forsaking all other, we must keepe our selues only to him, so long as we both shall liue. A good wife, though her husband be not iealous, yet will giue him her hand, her heart, and her body, but if she know him iealous, she will not giue him the least cause of suspition, either by talking of others, or walking with others; so the spouse
of Christ, though her Lord were not a iealous God, yet ha∣uing betrothed her self to him, and receiued pledges of his loue, should delight in him and none other: but considering hee is iealous, shee should haue a greater care to retaine and keepe all her senses chast, to obserue all loyalty and faithfulnesse, she should not (according to the precept of Moses and promiseEx. 23. 13. of Daaid) not so much as make mention of other gods withPs. 16. 4. her lips: But making protestation (as they in the Psalme) that she hath not forgotten, the name of her God, should reckon o∣therPs. 44. 20. gods such strangers to her, as though shee knew not their names, neither should they euer bee heard out of her mouth, much lesse should she euer come to Gilgall, or goe vp to Betha∣uen, desire oakes and chuse gardens, bow herselfe and humble her selfe, doe shamefully and follow her louers. Ʋisiting the sinne of the fathers vpon the children: A good man hates iniquity, not so much for the danger of it, as the indig∣nation, but feare keepes backe the bad man, when hee fore∣sees the danger, if he run into it: A galley-slaue fals to rowing, for he sees himselfe fast chained, and knowes he shall be surelyEx. 8. 8. & 10. 17. beaten, if he row not. Pharaoh becomes somewhat tractable, but punishment driues him to it. Balaam boweth and giuethNū. 22. 31. 34. good words, but danger is towards him. O derunt peccare mali formidine paa. As God therefore hath compassion of some, so others heeIude. 22. saues with feare, in this place he hath salt in his speach, and puts a wedge of yron into knotty wood: God will wrestle with the wicked, with them and theirs, not vsing his right hand of mercy, as he did with Iacob, when he supported him:Gē. 32. 24. but his left hand of iustice, as Iacob did with Esau, when heeGē. 25 27. supplanted him, and if he punish the posterity of wicked Ido∣laters, how great then and terrible shall their owne destructi∣on be, when their issue shall perish thorough their default. Visit: Almighty God the Bishop of our soules goes his vi∣sitation, he inquires of faults, and thoroughly sifts them out,1 Pet. 2. 25 then ministers the quantity of the punishment, according to the quality of the offence, this is the right visitation. Among vs are some visitations, non morum sed nummorum visitationes: But God visits not the purse, but visits the sinne, he will not spare the poore for pitty, nor the rich for bribes, hee will not
commute the penance, or respect any externall thing, whither it be comelines of body excellency of wit, nobility of stocke, antiquity of descent, the soule that sinneth shall die, and there isRō. 2. 11. no respect of persons. The sinne of the Fathers vpon the children: Men are dull vpon the spurre, and doe not easily bend when God bids them bow, therefore God threatneth to extend his rigour to their poste∣rity, hee will lay vp the sorrow of the father for his children: butIob. 21. 19. doth this stand with the iustice of God to punish the childe for the fathers offence? how then is the Scripture true, eueryGal. 6. 5. man shall beare his owne burden? how is the prouerbe true, euery fat shall stand on his owne bottome? if it be so, let that prouerbe which was out of date be renewed againe, the fathers haue eatenEze. 18. 2. sowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge. The Ciuill law (to fetch this point from our first originall) saith, Partus sequitur ventrem, the birth followes the wombe, that is, the child shall be as the mother, if shee be free, her child shall bee free, though shee marry a bond-man; and according to the lawes of the Realme, the child shall be as the father, but when father and mother are bond both, as ours are, then there is no question but the children are bond. The whelps of wolues though they can doe no hurt with hunting, yet already doe sport themselues in biting and delight in bloud: the brood of serpents (like the disciples of the Pharisees yonger in yeeres,Mat. 22. 16 but like in malice) are shorter in stature, but aequall in poy∣son, and who will blame him, that shall kill these whelpes and destroy the young serpents, though they haue yet no strength to hurt and cast forth their poyson? non prius nati quam damnati. And though children being young bring forth no bad fruit in the boughs, yet are they infected at the roote, but leaue this originall and goe on, if the father be a traitor to his Prince, doe you maruaile, if his children doe smart for it: if the hus∣band hath publike notice of his wiues adultry, shall hee not giue her a publike discharge? shall he smother the fault, which shee is not ashamed to set abroach? the disease of marriage is adultry, and the medecine is deuorcement: shall he put away the mother, and retaine her children, which he knoweth to bee an adulterous generation: now God is the husband of his Church, he marryed Israell to himselfe, but she in ioyning herHos. 4. 12.
selfe to Idols went a whoring from vnder her God, God there∣foreHos. 4. 12. Esa. 50. 1. forsakes her, and giues her a bill of diuorcement, and there∣fore if her children feele the smart, God bids them reason the case with their mother and not lay the blame vpon him; pleadeHos. 2. 2. with your mother, with an ingemination, pleade with her: A∣gaine God may punish the sinne of the parents on the Children, yet the cause of punishment may be in themselues, as if any be∣ing sicke of the plague, infect other and they dye, euery one of them is said to dye of his owne plague: God will not haue this prouerbe vsed in Israell, the fathers haue eaten sowre grapes &Eze. 18. 3. the Childrens teeth are set on edge, but if they eate sowre grapes as their fathers did, no maruaile though their teeth be set on edge. When God takes away his grace, they eate sowre grapes, and drinke their owne poyson, then are they as shippes cast vpon the rockes, dashed in pieces, or sunke in the sandes, when God not giuing them his grace they want all their tackling, then are they as a house which falles of it selfe, because God as a Samp∣son,Iud. 16. 29. hath withdrawen the pillers, then are they as olde lame men, which sinke of themselues when God will not lend them his grace, as a staffe to vpholde them. This God doth visit the iniquitie of the fathers on their Children, not by taking away any thing they had, but because he will not supply that they wanted, & this is no iniustice in God; for euery good gift com∣meth from him, grace is his, he may giue it to whom hee will, he may withold it from whom he please, it is lawfull for him to doe with his owne what he list: and hee many times with∣holdesMat. 20. 15 it from the Childe, when he considers the sinne of the father, and for that the father ran further and further into wickednes, he giues ouer the Children, so that they sell them∣selues to worke wickednes, that filling vp the the iniquitie of the fathers, they might haue their punishment cast into their bosome. And this is that wich Hosee saith concerning Israell, be∣causeHos. 2. 5. the mother played the harlot, and shee that conceiuedHos. 4. 13. them did shamefully: therefore their daughters shalbe harlots, that they might be punished for their owne faults, but mediate∣ly for the sinne of their parents which caused God to giue ouer their of-spring, that so they might giue head to their lusts, and bring a speedy destruction vpon themselues. This must teach both parents and children, each of them a
seuerall lesson, Parents to haue a greater care then other of dis∣charging their duty to God, for the neglect hereof brings a plague on themselues and on those which come out of their loynes, and if God accomplish not his iudgements assoone as a sinne is committed, hee can well worke them vpon the of∣spring of such as seeme to haue escaped his hand: I haue seene saith Eliphaz the foolish well rooted, and suddenly I cursed his habitati∣on, saying▪ his Children shall be farre from saluation, and they shall beIob. 5. 3. 4. destroyed in the gate: iudgement shall finde out the Children, though happely sometime it passe by the father: his bloud be onMat. 27. 25 vs and on our Children say the Iewes, to Pylate concerning the bloud of Christ, cruenti plane genitores (saith Saint Augustine) qui ante facti sunt paricide quam parentes. O cruell fathers which were paracides before they were parents: but though this wish had not been, yet this cruell crying sinne had come home to their Childrens doores, and been powred into their bosomes. Wee haue a prouerbe, happy is the Childe, when the father goes to the diuell, for example, the father not so much as rouing at God, makes the world his standing marke, he neuer thinkes of compassing heauen, but as Satan came from compassing the earth to and fro and from walking in it; so hee will compasse earthly things for him and his, and hauing the greedy worme vnder his tongue with Esops Dogge, would ingrosse the world for himselfe and his issue, now no way comes amisse to wealth, vsury, extortion, oppression, sacriledge, swearing, lying, sub∣telty, as porters shall bring in his gaine, now poore Naboth shall not hold his owne, because Ahab is sicke of his Vineyarde: like enough such a father goes to the diuell, but how is his Childe happy? you will say, because he shall gather all these riches which his father raked together, yet I say not happy, for many times we see there comes a sonne, that is as good with a forke as his father with a rake, as good a spendall, as his father get∣all, and scorning to thinke of the troubles and sighes of his fa∣ther in heaping vp his goods, consumes the fat of his prede∣cessors in few yeares, as the leane Kyne did eate vp the fat in Pharaohs dreame. Of all goods these may most truely be calledGen. 41. 4. moueable, for like larkes they fall to the ground faster then euer they mounted vp, and like cloudes neuer rest till they fall as they climed: Iob speaketh as though the wicked, when they
set vp their houses by pilling and poling, and rake other mens goods by hooke and by crooke, did but make a stacke of wood, and then commeth a sparke of Gods wrath and makes an endIob. 15. 34. of all: if therefore parents will be happy in themselues, happy in their posterity, let them loue God, keepe innocency & do thePsa. 37. 37. thing that is iust, for that shal bring a man peace at the last, thatPsa. 112. 2. shall bring Gods blessing vpon their children: the generation of the righteous shal be blessed when the vngodly shall perish, they shal see it. Secondly Children may heere learne to pray to God, not on∣ly to hide their owne sinnes in his woundes, to bury their owne offences in his death, to crosse their accompts and forget them al, but to pray further as in the Letany; Remember not Lord the of∣fences of our forefathers: not that we must pray for the dead, while we liue we must take an obligation of our selues, daily to pray for other, and commend each other to God by interchangeable prayers, but when men are dead, he that prayes for the good, does wrong to the good, he that prayes for the bad cannot mend him or helpe him with prayers. We allow not the sacrifices made for soules, nor those feralia dedicated to the infernal gods, that they might be pacified with those that are departed, hap∣pely some will say, were I not better pray for them, then to say, the diuell goe with them, as good a reason, as if a theefe being blamed for robbing a man vpon Shooters hill, or in Stangate hole, should reply and say, were I not better robbe him, then kill him, of euils euery one is to be auoyded. But thus farre wee pray, that God would not remember the sinnes of our forefa∣thers to visit them vpon vs who doe succeede them, for becauseDan. 9. 16. of our sinnes, and for the iniquities of our fathers God will set his face against vs, and let in one punishment or other vpon vs. Of those which hate me: they which transgresse the law of God, especiall they which lay his chiefe honour open to the spoyle of creatures, hate God and desire to spoyle him of his gouernement: Qui diligit meretricem, odit sponsam suam, hee that loues an harlot hates his owne spouse: and on the other side she that loues an other man, hates her own husband: now IdolatersHo. 2. 5. 13 Nu. 15. 39. play the harlots, and doe shamefully, and say, I will goe after my louers, they follow their louers, goe a whoring after their owneHo. 3. 1. & 4 17. eyes, looke to other gods and are ioyned to Idols, therefore may they well be sayd to hate God.
The effects doe sufficiently shew forth this hatred, for the bringers in of Idols, put God and his truth out of doores, andIudg. 11. 7. thereupon doth Iephtha proue that his brethren did hate him, because they did expell him out of his fathers house: Againe when men are out of loue with any thing they care not how lit∣tle while they keepe it, eyther they will sell it, as Iosephs brethren solde him to the Ishmaelites, or change it, as Israell did the or∣dinances:Gen. 37 28 Esa. 24. 5. now Idolaters make an exchange of God, & though no Nation euer changed their God, which yet are no gods, yet they change their glory. Therefore doe they hate God, because GodIer. 2. 11. hateth all them that worke wickednes. 1. Their God who made themPsa. 5. 5. glorious. This must teach Idolaters not to flatter themselues in their sinne, and to thinke they doe God good seruice, and loue him as well as the best; and therefore haue his image to shew their deuotion, for God saith they hate him. Secondly this teacheth, that we are not to giue Papists the commendation of good honest men, and to binde their religion as a crowne vnto them, for they be such as hate God, and lift vp their hands against him: therefore we must say with Dauid: IPsa. 31. 6. hate them that holde of superstitious vanities▪ and I hate them that hatePsa. 139. 21 thee, I hate them right sore as though they were mine enemies, or at leastwise we must be like the Phisition, which loues the patient and hates his disease. 2. Therefore we must haue no fellowship or ioyne in any league of frendship with them, for therefore in the olde Testament, Iehu takes vp Iehosaphat for that he would2. Cro. 12. 2 helpe the wicked, and loue them that hted the Lord; and in theMat. 9. 14. new Testament the Disciples of Iohn are blameable who ioyned themselues with the Pharisees, whom Christ condemned: who hated Christ, and sought to intangle him in his words. 3. Wee must not contract marriages with them, giue our daughters to them, or take their daughters to vs, as adultry is a cause of di∣uorce, so should Idolatry be a cause of restraint, and should hin∣der it as well as the other doth seperate it: when the birds assem∣bled themselues in Parlament there was a Decree past, that the Eagle for breeding of fairer birds, should ioyne in marriag with the Ostrich, whereupon he makes suite vnto her, but hauing been a while in her company, and perceiuing she did eate yron, and steele, and deuoure that which he could not abide, he gaue off his suite, so on the one side, if there be any externall thing, as anti∣quity
of discent, great kinred, much alliance, great wealth, many friends, good hope of raising, the house that should moue Prote∣stants to match in the houses of Papists and to graffe in their stocke; let them consider againe on the other side, that they bee haters of God, procurers of the Kings euill, hard-hearted, flagella Reipublicae, flabella seditionis, that they would deuoure a whole Parlament-house, and could well digest it, if Ierusalem were made an heape of stones. And shewing mercy vnto thousands of them that loue me, and keepe my Commandements. Our Sauiour Christ saith to Martha, thou artLuc. 10 41 troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary, so wee are troubled about many things; some about their farmes, someLuc. 14. 18 about their oxen, some about their wiues; all these in the beginning of Ecclesiastes, are vanity of vanities, and all vanity,Eccl. 1. 2. but one thing is ncssary▪ and that is in the end of Ecclesia∣stes,Ec. 12 13. feare God and keepe his Commandements: but here the Lord doth not say feare, but loue mee, and keepe my Commande∣ments, to shew that all the duty wee performe to God must proceede from loue: the law (saith Saint Paul) is not giuen to1 Tim. 1. 9 the righteous man, either to condemne him, or to compell him, for he will doe good of a good affection, without further con∣straint. God will haue the Israelits▪ bring offerings, for the ma∣kingEx. 25. 2. of the Tabernacle, but hee will not straine vpon any, but euery one shall giue as his heart doth encourage him, andEx. 35 21 as his spirit doth make him willing: Sonne, goe and worke todayMat. 21. 28 in my vineyard: vineyard, therefore a fit place; to day, therefore a fit time; sonne, therefore a fit person, for he will goe with good will, as readily as Samuell comes at a call, Here am I,1 Sam. 3. 5 not that thou compelledst mee, but, here am I, for you calledstEx. 8. 25. mee. The obedience of the wicked is wrested from them, as was Pharaohs, and their good deeds are spoiled in the wor∣king, as many a good tale is mard in the telling; but the god∣ly yeeld freely to obedience for loue, are not haled and drag∣ged by force, my heart is ready saith Dauid, with an ingemina∣tion,Ps. 57. 7. my heart is ready, ready for aduersity, ready for pro∣sperity, ready to bee humbled, ready to be exalted, ready to doe whatsoeuer thou commandest. This must teach vs to take heede wee doe not good things amisse that is true of the Canon Lawyers, God loues ad∣uerbs
better then adiectiues: not quam bonum, but quam bene;Luc. 18. 4. and therefore a good deed must be well done: Iustice readily, and therefore fye vpon the vniust Iudge; Almes willingly for2 Cor. 9. 7. grudging, like Colloquintida spoiles the whole potte of pot∣tage. A good mind cannot free a man from offence, when2 Sam. 6. 6. he doth ill; and therefore Vzzah doth ill to put his hand vnto the Arke: but a bad mind may make a man sin in doing good, and therfore Iudas was not without great fault in saluting ChristMat. 26. 49 to betray him. First therefore, we must looke what wee doe for the matter, to know this wee must aske counsell at the mouth of the Lord, his word must bee a touch-stone to try our actions, and the standard from which wee must not de∣part. Secondly, we must looke how we doe it for the manner, whither of loue or of feare, of a cheerefull or grudging mind; and to know this, wee must consult with our owne hearts, with Moses put our hands into our bosomes, rip vp our con∣sciences,Ex. 4. 6. take our soules to taske, and with the possessed re∣turne vnto our owne house, virtus uolentium nulla est. He thatLuc. 8. 39. doth good against his will, doth ill; God will haue vs volun∣tary men, good deeds must not be wrung out of vs, as ver∣iuyce out of the crabs when they are pressed, nor beaten outEx. 17. 6. of vs, as waters came out of the rocke, when Moses smote it with his rod, but they must sweetly flowe from vs, as riuersIoh. 7. 38. from the fountaine. The seruice we doe to our neighbours is not accepted with God, except it proceede from loue; If I giue all that I haue to feed the poore (saith the Apostle) and haue not1 Cor. 13. 3 loue, it profiteth me nothing: If I giue, and not lend, which is not so great liberality, mine owne (which I haue) not another mans; for many rob Peter and pay Paul, build Almes-houses with the superfluity of their vsury, make Hospitals with rac∣king their rents, inclosing of commons, with that which they haue gotten by briberie, oppression, and extorting from other, which indeed is not their owne: againe if I giue not a part but all, at the onely hearing whereof the young manMat. 19. 22 shrunke backe and went away sorrowfull, not to the rich but to the poore, for that were but to cast water into the sea: if I did all this to feed them, and as you would say to put life into them, when they were ready to perish for want of suste∣nance, yet all this notwithstanding, if loue be lacking, there
is wanting the best flowre in the garden, without which the rest yeeld no sweet smelling sauour to God: so likewise God accepteth no seruice we doe vnto himselfe, except loue as in this place like a Gentleman Vsher doth go before it, and there∣fore Saint Paul wisheth vs to offer vp our bodies a quicke sa∣crifice vnto God, quicke not onely because wee must offerRom. 12. 1. them quickely, against those which say of the temple of theirHag. 1. 2. bodies, as the Iewes of the Temple of Ierusalem, it is not yet time to build the Temple of the Lord, but because that which is quicke doth loue to be stirring, is ready and willing to moue of it selfe. And keepe my Commandements: Loue and obedience areGē. 38. 30. twins, and one followes the other, as Zarah came after Pha∣rez out of Tamars wombe; mixe the one with the other, and then is compounded the cup of saluation. This maketh against Hypocrites and proud boasters, which will inable themselues with their tongues, and say they loue God, but there is no such matter, for then would their out∣ward workes beare witnesse of their inward affection: Gods spirit worketh in a spirituall man, and makes him bring forth fruits of loue: as nature worketh in a naturall man, whose loue doth creepe where it cannot goe, and inclosed (as wee see in Ioseph) shineth as a candle thorough the chinkers.Gē. 43 34. The Angell put on the shape of man, that Manoah mightIud. 13. 1 see him, and loue must put on obedience, that the world may see it; Gideon must haue none to bee his souldiers, but such asIud. 7. 6. 7 vse as well their hand as their tongue; let no man therefore glory more to bee a linguist then a realist. The Church is a widdow, for as shee is called a mother, because shee bringeth forth children to God, and nourceth them with the milke, which streame out of her two breasts, the Old and New Te∣stament, as shee is called a virgin, because she keepeth the faith, the faith of Christ sound and whole, as shee is called a bride, because Christ did marry her to himselfe: so is shee called a widdow, because her husband is ascended into heauen, there sitting at the right hand of Maiesty, which here liued at the left hand of aduersity, and her loue and obedience are like the two mites, which the widdow threw into the treasuryLuc. 21. 1. more accepted of God, then the gifts which the rich threw in
of their superfluity, here they goe hand in hand, and neuer must be put asunder. Yee are my friends (saith our Sauiour Christ) if yee doe what∣soeuerIoh. 15. 14 I command you: as for others which doe not that which he commandeth, which will not waite vpon him, and con∣forme themselues to his obdedience, which will not study to acquit their duties, and by obseruing his will get him honour, they are but retainers, and doe onely weare his liuery for a countenance, and God is so farre from accepting them as his friends, that he will neuer, either by fauour or wages owe them for his seruants. Shew mercy: The vpper region of the ayre is calme, Euery liuing creature the more powre it hath by nature, the more prone it is to mercy; the Lyon the prince of all the rest, spareth those that are prostrate, the king of bees wants a sting, now God who sitteth aboue the heauens, is high aboue all gods, of greatest powre; because the powers that are, are ordained by him:Rom. 13. 1 cuius iussu nascuntur homines, eius iussu constituuntur Principes (saith Irenaeus) & inde illis potestas, vnde spiritus, saith Tertullian; hee that giues birth and breath, giues might and maiesty, and therefore of greatest mercy, because of his power: where∣fore Dauid hauing mentioned his wonders doubleth his gracePs. 111. 4. and mercy, for he is mercifull in his wonders, and wonderfull in his mercies. It is Gods property to shew pitty and fauour, hee is best acquainted with it; but to punish is a strange thing to him, his worke, his strange worke, his Act, his strange Act: andEsa. 28. 21. therefore when he visits iniquity, hee is said, to goe out of his place: God doth in this place set downe his goodnesse, I theEsa. 26. 21. Lord thy God: then his iustice, visiting the iniquities: but as though he had not so well liked the left hand way, hee turns againe on the right hand, saying, he will shew mercy, and not suffer the sunne to set in a cloud: but what needs mercy, when a man loues God, and keeps his Commandements? shall not such a man haue a reward as due debt? Steuen Gardiner Bi∣shop of Winchester, in the Raigne of King Edward the sixt, ha∣uing many Articles laid against him, stood much vpon his in∣nocency, saying, hee had neither offended Law, Statute, Act, or Proclamation, thinking he had so little need of mercy, that very Iustice would relieue him; but in conclusion, being asked
by the Lord Chancellor, whither he would not desire the King to bee his good Lord, and accept his pardon, alas my Lord (quoth he) I haue not so forgotten my selfe, but I will on my knees desire the King to bee good to mee: so let a mans innocency be such, that no body can say, blacke is his eye: let him be as iust as Iob 1. 1. Iob, who was many an ace before Gardiner) one that feared God, and eschued euill; who intending to make protestation of his vprightnes saith, he hath not dealt amisse towards men; for there is no wickednesse in his hands, and secondly hath performed his duty to God, for Iob 16. 17 his prayer is pure, let his desires be good, and his deeds answerable to his desires, yet hee may beare a part in that song of mercy, Ps. 51. 7 Asperge me Domine: and the best lambe should abide the slaughter, except the Ramme were sacrificed that Gen. 22. 13. Isaac might be saued, if wee loued God with all our heart, with all our soule, with all our strength, and our neighbour as our selues, then might wee challenge a reward at Gods hands, as though salation stood on our merits not Gods mercies, but we doe it but in part, and therefore not in so great a measure as we ought, and therefore had need of mercy. If we could say indeed vnto God, as the elder sonne vnto his father, neuer Luc. 15. 29. brake I at any time thy com∣mandement, and as the young man vnto Christ, Mat. 19. 20. I haue ob∣serued all these things from my youth; If we could fulfill the law in euery point, then vpon discharge of debt, euery one might call for an acquittance, aske for a quietus est, and say further, Luc. 15. 12. giue me the portion, which to me belongeth; but wee keepe it no further forth then God by his spirit doth in able vs, and in ma∣ny things wee sinne all, and therefore had need of mercy: Ʋe ho∣minum vitae, quantumuis laudabili, si remota misericordia iudicetur; though I were iust, saith Iob 9. 15 Iob, Yet could I not answere, but I would make supplication to my Iudge: Iob 10. 15. If I haue done wickedly, woe vnto mee: if I haue done righteously, I will not lift vp mine head. Rō. 7. 19. Saint Paul speaking of his life confesseth his infirmities, that the good that he would doe, he did not, and the euill that hee would not doe, that he did; that his flesh was insolent against the spirit, and kept it vnder with a strong hand, that his will like another Eue, was still prouoking him to reach after the forbidden fruit: that his nature was rotten in the roote, so that when he should be lifted vp to heauen, with the wings of
grace; he was kept downe with the leaden lumpe of the old man; like a bird which would fly vpward, but is kept backe by a string tyed at her legge; but hee carried himselfe so faith∣fully; so vprightly in his office, that hee could not onely say, which of you can rebuke me of sinne, but he seeing further in∣to himselfe then another man could, did truely say; I know nothing 1 Cor 4. 4 by my selfe, hee disposed the secrets of God, his sound was heard like Ex. 28. 33. Aarons belles, he did cry downe sinne in earnest, made Moses and Christ to meet on the Luc. 10. 30. 34. Mount, preached the law, which like the theeues woundeth, then sets abroach the Gospell, which like the Samaritan salueth, that the wounded conscience might drinke of the water. But what of all this? shall he, or can hee glory in it, or challenge any thing for it? noe 1 Cor. 4. 4. I know (saith he) nothing by my selfe, yet am I not hereby iu∣stified, for God, who seeth further into vs, then we can into our selues, (for hee is greater then the conscience) spyeth imper∣fections in our best workes, and in very deed, the best men haue some let, spot, or want, euen in their very deuotions: goe to prayer, when the best men haue prayed, they had need to pray againe, that God would forgiue the faults in their prayers; and therefore there is an Angell that powreth sweet odours into the prayers of the Saints, to shew that they yeeld no sweet sauour to God, without fauour in Christ: Goe to loue, Reu. 8. 3. Peter loued much, but yet hee did fault in his loue, when hee heard of the passion, as he did afterward fall fromb Mat. 16. 22. his loue, when the passion was hard at hand. We desire to bec Luc. 22. 57. but conformable to the Angels, Mat. 6. 10. (They will be done in earth, as it is in heauen) but the Angels are not without blemish in his sight; and though there were no other thing, yet the very corruption of our flesh it selfe doth infect that, which of it selfe is pure as a muddie ground doth the cleane water, and as an vnsauery caske doth the good wine that is put into it. This serueth to condemne such, as relie vpon their owne merits, especially such, as thinke Gods law too strait for their holinesse; stand for supererogation aboue law, supposing they are so farre from need of mercy, that they haue satis∣factions to spare for others, ouer and aboue their owne dis∣charge; for when the Lord saith, he will shew mercy to the best, he insinuateth Luc. 17. 10 that when wee haue done all wee can, we are
vnprofitable seruants; and that reward is giuen not according to our deserts, but according to the worthines of him that doth bestow it: our merit is the mercy of the Lord, and as long as God is manifold in mercies, man is manifold of de∣serts: indeed we are ready to stand too much vpon our good actions, and therefore the Psalmographer teacheth vs to speake twice against our selues; Ps. 115. 1. Not vnto vs, O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue the praise: A good man doth that for which hee came, not so as hee can boast, but so as God ac∣cepts it, while he pardons his weaknes, so that our righteous∣nes consists rather in forgiuenes of our sinnes, then perfection of our vertues, and when God rewardeth vs, hee recompenseth vs according to his owne honour, not according to the basenes of our owne hearts, or the estimation wee haue of our owne worth. Againe this serueth, for the comfort of those, which are de∣termined to keepe the word of God, which enforce them∣selues to obey it, and to walke in the name of the Lord their God for euer, yet grone vnder the burden of their sinnes, and when they would doe good, euill is present with them, cals at their doors, craues entertainement, and of force will bee their tennant; I say this is their comfort to know, that God will shew mercy, si faciunt pracepta, etsi non perficiunt, if they keepe his commandements in truth, though they fulfill them not in perfection: God accepteth that, which his children doe willingly though weakely, he takes the will for the worke, and measuring the deed by the desire, and the desire by since∣rity, will shew mercy, hee will shew it, it shall appeare and shine, as Saint Tit. 2. 11. Paul speaketh of the grace of God, as if the Lord had reared it vp in the midst of the firmament like the sun, that all the world might see it. To thousands: The Lord is mercifull and righteous, and our God is full of compassion: Ps. 116. 5 I the Lord thy God, here the Lord is mer∣cifull: visiting the sinnes, here he is righteous: shewing mercy to thousands, here our God is full of compassion: visiting sins to the third and fourth generation, not that he confines himselfe to three or foure discents, for when he had executed venge∣ance vpon the posterity of Ham; to the sixt and seuenth gene∣ration; yet his wrath was not turned away, but his hand was
stretched out still; and shewing mercy to thousands; not that hee ties himselfe to any set number, but making comparison of iustice and grace, he sheweth that hee is more prone to mer∣cy, and that this mercy doth outgoe his iustice, as that other Discipel did out run Ioh. 20. 4 Peter, as they posted to the sepulchre. Iu∣stice is Gods left hand, mercy is his right, now God is right∣handed, he vseth his right hand more then his left, therefore that is the greater of the two: if his wrath like Nilus hath ouer∣flowed a while, at last like the flouds in Ex. 15. 8. Exodus, it stands still as an heape; or else like Iorden, it is driuen backe; or is like the waters about Ierusalem, which might be dryed vp withl Ps. 1 14. 3 the tramplings of an army: Es. 37. 25 but his mercy is as the fountaine of the gardens, Can. 4. 15 a Well of liuing waters, and the springs of Leba∣non the one, like the garments of the Gibeonites, worne outo Ios. 9. 13. in a few discents, the other like the Deu. 29 5 garments of the Israelites in the wildernesse, which did not weare; the one like the wings of the Eagle in Dan. 7. 4. Daniels vision, pluckt off, the otherr 1 King. 6 27. like the winges of the Cherubims, neuer pulled in but euer stretched forth, the one like 2 King. 4. 6. the widdowes Oyle which ran a while, and then ceased, the other like Ps. 133. 2 Aarons oyle, for as that rested not on Aarons head, but ran downe vpon his beard, and went down to the very skirts of his garments. So Gods mercy resteth not on the head, on the good father, but discendeth to his children, to the next generation, and so along still to the lowest borders of his religious issue. Gods mercy died not with Abraham, but stretched it selfe to his righteous seed, from generation to generation: as the kindnesse of the Athe∣nians to that same good and iust Aristides dyed not with him, but extended it selfe to his posterity, for when hee died so poore, that he left not to bury him according to his place and desert, they respecting his children, gaue his sonne Lysima∣chus one hundred Minas, that is 240. pounds, and married his daughters at the charge of the City. This serueth first, for the comfort of those good parents, which haue a great charge of children, and small meanes to leaue them, who doe not see the riuers, and flouds, and streames of hony and butter themselues, whose children inhe∣riting the wind, are like enough to be filled with pouerty, this I say, is a comfort to thinke, that though they cannot make
their sonnes and daughters plenteous in goods, though their hand did not get much, though they did not heape vp riches for them, though they did not lay vp golde for dust, and the golde of Ophir as the flints of the Riuer; yet they shall leaue them the blessing of God, his mercy shall discend to them, which is as Maryes, the better part and shall not be taken away from them, which will make that lit∣tle which they haue, like the 2. Kin. 4. 6 widdowes Oyle, to increase or raise them vp friends to supply their want, as it did Boaz vnto Ruth: or teach them euery one to say to his heart from a contented minde, Ru. 2. 8. this is my lot appointed by God, this little that I haue sufficeth and therefore I will not so often say with the multitude, who will shew vs any good? as pray with Dauid, Psa. 4. 6. Lord, lift vp the light of thy counte∣nance vpon vs. Againe on the other side, this serueth for the comfort of good children, which discend of poore parents, but yet of such as feare God and eschew euill; to thinke that though their fathers substance was not great, though he was not fatte in the earth, though there were no riches and treasures in his house, though his Tabernacle did not flourish, though hee could not bequeath vnto them Cattle, siluer, golde, sheepe or beeues, because he had but according to his necessitie, that which others haue in aboundance & superfluitie: yet he 1. Tim. 6. 6. had the riches of the soule, godlines, which the Scripture calleth great riches, he was not plunged in the superstitions of Popery, nor would euer say to the wood awake, or to Ex. 3. 2. the dumb stone stand vp, he was a temple of God, Gods spirit dwelt in him. And therefore though the world did frowne vpon him, yet the blessing of God, and the good will of him that dwelt in the bush did come vpon his head, I now will follow his steppes, and be such a perfect patterne of his best parts, that hee that sees the suruiuor may know the disceased, and then I know though I cannot haue the world at will, yet I likewise shall haue Gods blessing some other waies, and the extent of his mercyes will reach vnto me and mine, from one generation to another. Againe this doth win our hearts vnto Gd▪ if not in pietie yet in good nature, how was Mephboshth bound vnto King
Dauid, that he would looke vpon such a b dead dogge as he was and shew him mercy, and so great fauour for Ionathan his fathers sake, how much more are good children bound vnto God, who shewes mercy to them for their fathers sake and to their children after them: who is constant in his fauours, who giues no period to his goodnes, where there is a true concurrence, whose promises are without conculsion, whose mercyes are sayd euerlasting, because when they begin they haue no end, whose former fauours are patterns of his future blessings, and an earnest penny layd in hand, to assure that which is to come, the foote of whose blessings on the father, are still treading on the heeles of the childe. Lastly to conclude this Commandement, as Dauid wishing a curse vpon his enemies, sayth, Psa. 109. 14. Let the wickednes of his fathers be had in remembrance with the Lord, and let not the sinne of his mo∣ther be done away, so on the other side let vs wishing a blessing vpon our selues, as it were tie God to it by putting him in re∣membrance of his mercyes to our good predecessors: So doth Salomon at the end of his prayer, 2. Cro. 6. 42. Remember the mercyes to Da∣uid thy seruant: Salomon had many times desired God to haue mercy on his people, and vsed diuers arguments to perswade him to it, but reserued the strongest, (Ioh. 2. 10. as the gouernour of the feast did the best wine vntill the last,) to the shutting vp of his prayer, that like a postscript it might not be forgotten: and Ethan the Ezrahite seeing the desolation of Dauids King∣dome meruailes much that hee could not see the streame of Gods mercyes run on still as it had begun, Psa. 89. 49. Lord where are thy former mercyes, which thou swearest vnto Dauid in thy truth. As therefore the Lacedemonians, crauing ayde of the Atheni∣ans, did not once mention the good that they the Lacedemoni∣ans had done for them, but only the kindnes which they and their predecessors had receiued from them; so in crauing any thing of God, let vs not alledge our merits, for if we doe well, Psa. 16. 2. our well doing extendeth not to him, but the blessings that we and our forefathers haue receiued at his hands, as to say, O Lord thou didest neuer pull in thy hand from rewarding our fathers, or holde it out empty, but didest still teach what thou wouldest doe, by what thou hadest done, be still like olde Isaac, blesse where thou hast blessed, let thy fauours to them
be an obligation, and binde thee to watch to doe vs good, though thou didest giue, yet thy store was not abated, when they had the most, they did leaue no lesse behinde, thou be∣ing infinite canst not admit of any diminution, let thy good∣nes, which is without lymit, stretch and streame from them to vs and ours for euermore. The third Commandement. Exod. 20. 7. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vame: for the Lord will not hold him guiltles, that taketh his name in vaine. THE tongue is a little member, but it is an vnrulya Ia. 5. 5. 8. 6. euill, full of deadly poyson: fire and water are two good seruants, but two bad masters, the tongue is fire, a good seruant, if we ouer-rule it, a bad master if it ouer-rule vs; the best dish for Gods seruice, if it be well seasoned with salt, the worst, if it stinkes and be corrupt, and therefore in this Commandement God would binde the tongue to the good abearing, 1 Kin. 2 36. and as Salomon doth to Shemei, set downe boundes to lymit it, that it transgresse not: here therefore first we haue a hedge, secondly a binder: the hedge first keepes out the beastly prophanation of Gods name that it enters not into vs, secondly keepes vs within the groundes of Gods glory, that wee haue a care to hal∣low his name according to the first petition of the Lords prayer. Gods name is prophan∣ed in Wordes in oathes swearing idlely, when there is noe vse of an oath. without oathes forswearing villanously, when wee make it serue for an vnlawfull vse, thereby to bring a wicked pur∣pose to passe. Deedes OVr Sauiour Christ to teach vs to auoide oathes, euen the Mat. 9. least idle oathes setteth downe first his precept, sweare
not at all, then his patterne for as the Angell to confirme the two Maryes in the faith of the resurrection vseth these words, Mat. 28. 7 Loe, I haue tolde you: so doth he in other cases the like wordes, as, if it were not so, I would haue tolde you: Againe Ioh. 14. 2. I tell you the truth, how often doe we heare him speaking thus. Verely, ve∣rely I say vnto you, or vsing the like protestations, thus both the lesson of his lippes, and practise of his lesson must reach vs that we suffer not oathes to fly at all aduentures, and waite on our words and talke of no importance, to serue where our humour shall place them, that we defile not our tongues with swear∣ing at randome, with an oath at the end of euery word: But let mens throates be open sepulchers and by swearing cast vp a stinking sauour into the nostrells of God, yet they cloake them with excuses as Gen. 27. 16. Rebeccah did couer the smooth of Iacobs necke with the skinnes of the Kiddes of the Goates. 1 I sweare truely saith one, this is a salue for his sore not to heale it but to hide it. 2 I shall not be beleeued without an oath saith another, here is another whorish complexion dawbed on, that this sinne might not appeare in it owne colours. 3 I meane no body any hurt saith a third, but being vsed to let fall an oath now and then, it droppes from me with other words, before I am aware, this is his figge-leafe. 4 I doe not vse oathes of sound saith the fourth, but now and then a petty trifling oath; that is nothing, thats not to be stood vpon. Thus sinne is not without a shift, and it is a desperate fault that hath no plea, as it is a course wooll that will take no dye, but plead not, this sinne is past all sufficient excuse able to beare it out; Mar. 10. 50. with the beggar cast away this cloake, this wrinkle will not be hidden, and howsoeuer you boulster this crompt shoul∣der, yet it is a blemish. To the first sort: say the oath be true: truth is but one circumstance belonging to an oath: Ier. 4. 2. thou shalt sweare, the Lord liueth in truth, in iudgement, and in righteousnes, in truth, and therefore away with a false oath, 2. in iudgement and therefore away with a rash oath, in righteousnes and there∣fore away with an vnlawfull oath: say the oath with which we sport our selues be not false: yet it may be idle, otiosum est, quod caret ratione iuste necessitatis, aut intentione piae vtilitatis, Mat. 12. 36. and if we
shall giue accompt for idle wordes, shall not idle oathes be called to a reckoning: shall not an Item for idle swearing bee put in the counting booke, when idle speach is not without an Item? but doe they alwaies sweare truely, who suffer oathes to run alwayes in their mouthes, and tosse them like tennis∣bals, vp and downe at their tongues end? some grauell or mudde passeth away with much water, some lyes with much talke, and false oathes vpon lyes, & no maruaile if he that swea∣reth often, doth too often forsweare himselfe, nay a mar∣uaile, if he doth not, how can he keepe any faith or truth in him, that sweares it out continually, hee sweares it all away. To the second sort, he that trusts thee, will beleeue thee without an oath, he hath experience of thy fidelity, and knoweth that neither feare nor loue, gaine nor losse, can make thee eate thy word, and as Ioh. 19. 22 Pilate saith Quod scripsi, scripsi, so an honest man, Quod dixi, dixi, that which he hath said, he hath said, as though he speaketh once Mat. 5. 37 and twice, yea yea, nay nay, as though his word were a double bond, his yea is his oath, his word his obligation, his saying as currant as his coyne, so strong that substantiuelike it can stand by it selfe, and needs no oath to vnderprop it: but on the other side, he that beleeues thee not, the more thou swearest, the more hee mistrusts thee, thou hast so often broken the head of truth, and crackt thy credit, that thou art become bankerout, be∣come like a bad hound, who hath so often spent his mouth vp∣on no sent, that now the rest of the hounds will lend no lon∣ger eare vnto him, hee hath been ouerseene with credulity dammaged by thy disapointment, thon hast said Promitto did signifie to promise, and not to pay, and therefore he will leane no longer vpon a broken staffe, hee will trust thee vpon thy obligation, not vpon thy oath, vpon thy parchment, not vp∣on thy prattlement, hee will beleeue annulo, not animo, know∣ing thou more regardest thy seale, then thy soule. Iuras? credit minus, nou iuras? credere non vult. He will not beleeue thee if thou swearest not, he will lesse beleeue if thou swearest; hee will not take thy beare word, much lesse will he take it, if it come couered with an oath; but say thou meanest to deale honestly and truely, yet thou
meetetst with some men, with whom thy yea and nay will take no place, whereas thy oath would carry the matter. In this case preferre Gods honour, before thine owne credit, Jet rather the incredulous suspect thee without a case, then God condemne thee for transgression. To the third sort, which writh and wreath like snakes to hide this sinne, vnder the couert of custome: I say it is true, euery sinne looks for continuall entertainement, where it hath once gotten an haunt, as humours fall towards their old issue. We are not weaned from vsuall euils, for custome hardens the heart, and stiffens the necke, and seareth the conscience; it is a waterstreame carrying vs away, and wee had rather follow the course of the streame, then row against it: assoone shall a man learne to leaue his mother tongue, as an vsuall oath, it is faex in dolio, cleaueth fast vnto vs, and is almost turned into nature: the single corde is soone snapt a sunder, the double worke is like to hold out, Ec. 4 12. but a three-fold cod is not easily broken. Sinne is single in the thought, doubled in the worke, and trebled in custome, it begins in the buds of infirmity, creepeth to the twigs of negligence, and the slender twigge becomes a stately tree, and that which at first with the hands might easily be pluckt vp, being ouertaken by custome, groweth to a stowt tree of contempt, and will hardly afterward with an axe be cut downe, being readier to breake then to bend, to any good instruction: Gen. 42. 15. 16. Ioseph accustoming himselfe to the oathes of Aegypt, sweares againe and againe, and if we goe about to repell an accustomed sinne, the diuell doth vexe vs with solliciting, and say to vs, as the people to Pilate: Mar. 19. 8 Doe as thou hast euer done? But it is therefore safely done, because it is done commonly? shall we account this a good plea, wee haue so often vsed our tongues to swearing, that now we cannot leaue it; this is so farre from excusing vs, that the plea is as bad as the fault, for oathes are precious, and things precious through common vse lose their estimation: neither will it excuse vs any more, when we shall come to be arreigned before the iudgement seate of God, then that Apo∣logy would the theefe, who being indited, desired the Iudge he might escape vnpunished, for stealing was his custome from his youth, and now he could not leaue it, to whom the
Iudge replyed, it was his custome to giue iudgement against such malefactors; and therefore he must be condemned: let therefore little by little good custome, shake off and pluck vp that, which euill costume hath brought in and ingrafted, and the more deepely it is rooted in vs, the more paine let vs take to root it vp, and doe the best we can to crosse this and euery bad custome, yea though we cannot turne the streame, yet let vs swimme against it. To the fourth sort, which say they doe not curse God, nor choppe his heart in peeces, nor throwing his name to the ground, tread and trample it vnder their feet, they doe not like madde dogs fly in their masters face; indeed they deny not, but that they vse small oathes as, faith, troth, masse, crosse, or the like, and what matter is it, if they be so prodi∣gall of these trifling oathes, that they pawne them for euery trifle at euery word? To these I say; Our nature is such, that we say of a great sinne, as Lot of the City Zoar, Gen. 19. 20. is it not a lit∣tle one? and as when wee haue sinned, the diuell shewes vs one of his two false glasses, wherein he maketh our sinne ap∣peare so great, that it cannot be forgiuen: so before wee haue sinned he shewes the other glasse, making the sinne ap∣peare little, and the punishment none at all, the case being thus; no maruaile though we thinke we haue yeelded much if we acknowledge a beame to be a mote, an hainous offence to be a crime, or a crime to be an errour: but howsoeuer men flatter themselues, yet thse petty oathes are great faults, and to be refused in our talke, as poyson in our meat, he that shall giue his fatih, and lay his truth in pawne, pawneth whatso∣euer is most precious in his soule, and hee that sweares by the Masse, is as he that sweares by Zeph. 1. 5 Malcham, against whom God will stretch out his hand to cut him off. Our Sauiour Christ forbids them all by flatte statute, Mat. 5. 34 sweare not at all, men∣tioning certaine oathes vsuall among the Iewes, neither by hea∣uen, or earth; including in them all naturall creatures, or Ie∣rusalem, including all artificiall; I like his wit well, but giue him no other commendation, who sitting at a churles table, but yet an vnbidden guest, would bee still swearing, by this meate, by this bread, by this cheese, by this drinke, that thereby he might take occasion to eate and drinke with him, for it con∣firmes
the matter, if a man takes downe that, by which hee sweareth, insomuch as his host, weary of such a guest wished him to leaue off his swearing. Our Sauiour Christ dehorts vs from these small cōmon oathes, because they haue a bad begin∣ning, Mat. 5. 37 whatsoeuer is more then yea yea, nay nay, commeth of euill; proceeds from an inward, and secret corruption, whereby the diuell tempts vs, and Saint Ia. 5. 12. Iames disswades vs from them, because they haue as bad an end, and will haue men refraine them, lest they fall into condemnation: if no excuses are strong enough to vphold these kind of oathes, which men reckon are of no reckoning; then I need not to take paine to put downe blasphemous oathes, for being a heauy burden, they fall of themselues. To blame therefore are those dogs, which make no bones in tearing Gods name, who cast vp their chil∣dren to God, as though he were their vnderling, as an angry and fumish master giues his seruant a buffet with his fist. The common gamester, if he be on the loosing side, will make his tongue run as fast against God, as Cards, Dice, and bowles doe run against him, he will rent and teare his name, as a draper rasheth out a peece of cloath to the buyer, his oathes like hail-shot shall flye vp and downe the roome, where hee hath his losse. Let a man taking these iniuries done vnto Christ as his owne wrongs (for Christ tooke all our sins vp∣on him) tell him of his blaspheming, let him goe about to bring home this Asse from going further astray, as the law prouided we should our neighbours Asse: let him crosse himu Ex. 23. 4 in his swearing, all this is but losse of diligence, there is no possibility of reformation, perswasions are in vaine, better suffer him in his fury, then minister aduice, his wound by med∣ling with it, is made the greater, and like hot water by stir∣ring, it casteth vp the more fume; say to wrest the strings of his tongue in tune, they will snappe and breake vpon you, this old bottle will breake with new wine, the more you rub him, the more will this gald horse kicke, the more you touch him, the more will this toad swell, the more you meddle with him, the more will this serpent gather poyson in his throate, and in his head to vomit out, goe about to coole him, you shall but adde to his fire, and increase his heate, as the water doth the heate in lime, and the smithes forge, for he hath sworne
he will sweare it out, and fill vp his periods with oathes of sound: goe to the profane swaggerer, as he seldome thinkes vpon God but in time of affliction, (for the crosse-house is his schoole-house his aduersity his vniuersity, his rew his hearbe of grace) so he will seldome name him but in his oathes, of which he will vpon small occasion shoote such chaine-shot, that you would thinke he would make the windowes of heauen to shake & totter. The souldiers put Christ to death, but did not breakex Ioh. 19. 33. a bone of him, but these gallants crucifying to themselues againe the Sonne of God breake his bones, diuide him into bones, handes, feete, bloud, heart, sides, curse and ban and champe him in their mouthes. I reade of an adultresse wife, who hauing had three sonnes, tolde her husband vpon her death-bed, that she had turned to euill and committed a trespasse against him, that hauing for∣gotten the couenant of her God, other men had bowed downe vpon her, and of her three children, one onely was his, and so dyed without further discouery, this father, desirous that the sonne begotten of his owne body might inherit his land and goods, making his last Will, intreated his exequetors to vse the best meanes they could to try out which of the three was his naturall sonne, and vnto him he bequeathed his land and all that he had; these exequetors, not like many other, which like vultures prey on the dead, and as the Phenix doe rise on others ashes, tolde the children that their fathers Will was doubtfull, the land little, the goods not great, and deuided, what were they among so many? The best way was to try by hap hazard, which of them should haue all: Whereupon set∣ting vp the dead corpes against a tree they deliuered to euery of them a Bowe and Arrowes, telling them, that he that could shoote nearest the fathers heart, should carry the whole, the two bastards in whom was neuer kindled any sparke of naturall affection, drew to the head and shot with good will at the heart, but the third did feele nature so working in him, that he refused so vnnaturall a fact, whereupon the wise and trusty Exequetors, iudging him to be the true sonne, deliuered vnto him his fathers legacy, according to that saying; —Legum seruanda fides, suprema voluntas quod mandat fierique iubet paerere necesse est.
Now if blaspheming swearers shall prepare their Bowes and make ready their Arrowes within the quiuer; that they may not priuiely, but openly shoote at God, if they arme them∣selues to stricke him with some deadly wound; and letting their oathes as arrowes fly, pierce the honour of the most highest, it is an argument they are bastards and not sonnes, and therefore Iob. 39. 37. with Iob we must either lay our handes vpon our mouthes, and with Dauid keepe Psa. 39. 1. our mouthes as it were with a bridle, or else set the feare of God as a Porter at the doore of our lippes to examine our wordes before they goe out. But as the Lord hauing shewed the Prophet Ez. 8. 8. Ezechiell, the abomi∣nations of the Children of Israell, bad him digge in the wall, and he should see yet greater abominations which they did; so though you haue already seene the abomination of the pro∣fane man in blaspheming God▪ Yet digge deeper, and diue further into the wordes of his mouth, and you shall see greater abominations; you shall haue a man vow to doe mischiefe, and then strengthen himselfe in his sinne by an oath, and then hee thinkes he must not goe backe, for he takes his oath to be an entrance into band to performe his vow. Such was the Ios. 9. 15. oath of the Princes in a case of pitty, and the oath of those forty men and vpwards in a case of cruelty; but it is a great fault to make such a rash Act. 23. 12. vowe, and therefore men should recall it, and be∣ing sorry for it, draw water out of their hearts and power it out before the Lord: but to performe it because of their oath is a double fault, for by this doing they make as though God did patronize their sinne, and as though he did approue of it. It was a fault in Mar. 6. 22. 23. Herod to promise the dauncing damsell whatsoeuer she asked, euen to the halfe of his Kingdome, but to adde an oath and grant her request, because of his oath, and thereupon to send and behead Iohn Baptist (for it was his head which she desired) did double his fault: Gen. 49. 5 As Simeon & Leui were brethren in euill, so subtelty and cruelty sisters in sin were combined in that vsurper Richard the 3. subtelty tooke order for the time, place, and meanes, when, where, and how the Lord Hastings should be brought to loose his head, cruelty hastely vndertooke the Act and gaue the stroke but to behead him, not vpon any iust cause, without examination, without any stay after his ap∣prehension, because of his oath, (for hee had sworne that hee
would not dyne, till he did see his head from his shoulders, was a fault far greater then would haue been the breach of his vn∣lawfull oath: In Lattin an oath is iusiurandum, ius must go before iurandum, & when that which thou swearest is lawfull and right, then pedem hinc ne discesseris, be sure thou abide by it, else thou runnest into pariury which is an especiall fault forbidden in this Commandement. Leu. 9. 12 Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe: An oath hath beene alwaies holden as most religious Gen. 21. 23. Abimelech tooke no other band of Abraham, for assurance that hee should deale well with him and his children after him then his owne oath. Ios. 9. 4. &c. The Gibeonites thought themselues safe enough, when Ioshua and the Princes of the congregation had sworne vnto them to saue their liues, though the oath was wrested from them by subtelty; in the warre betwixt Rome and Carthage when the Carthaginians had taken Regulus a worthy Romane prisoner, they, vpon his oath onely to returne againe, sent him home to Rome on a message, which when he had performed, he returned backe againe a prisoner to Carthage, according to the faith he plighted. Their owne faith were the best pledges that the Em∣perour Charles, and King Frauncis the first layd in pledge, when they made their leagues, the one with the Souldian of Persia, the other with the Turke. Pharaoh did neuer sweare that Iacob should be buryed in the land of Canaan, when he dyed in Egypt, but he thinkes it a foule fault, if he should keepe Ioseph (who liued in his Dominion) from keeping touch with his father; and therefore saith vnto him, Gen. 50. 6 Goe vp and bury thy father, as hee made thee to sweare: Act 7. 16. The other Patriarkes as well as Ioseph were remoued into Sychen and put in their Sepulchers, Ex. 13. 19 but there is an especiall mention made of Iosephs bones, because of the oath, for Ioseph dying in Egypt, made the children of Israll sweare, that they should carry his bones thence: Gen. 50. 25. God who is called a witnes, is called a reuenger if we make no conscience of an oath: Rom. 1. 9 God chalengeth the children of Israell 2. Cor. 1. 23. because they had forsaken him, and sworne by them that are no gods, Ier. 5. 7. and threatneth that they shall fall and neuer rise vp againe, which sweare by the sinne of Samaria, Amo. 8. 14. that is by the Idoles there wor∣shipped. Yet is it a greater offence to sweare q by the true God falsely, then by a false god truely, for he cares not to of∣fend God, who abuseth his name to colour his lying, but he that
shall doe this in an open assembly, when a matter shall come to try all before a Iudge betwixt party and party, is offensiue to three persons. 1. Deo, quem peierando contemnit, 2. iudici, quem∣mentiendo fallit, 3. innocenti, quem falsus testis laedit to God, of whom he makes no reckoning, for as though he were a Knight of the post, he brings him at a call to witnes a lye at his pleasure, 2. to the Iudge, for he binding his lye with an oath, causeth the Iury to bring in a wrong verdict, and thereupon the Iudge to giue an vniust iudgement, 3. to the party innocent, for he robbes him of that which of right belongeth to him, and so is as well guilty of iniury, as periury, and if it were better r for a manMat. 18. 6 to haue a milstone hanged about his necke and be drowned in the depth of the sea then offend one little one, then what iudgement remaineth, for him which offendeth great ones, God in heauen that great Iudge, the indge in earth, that little god. Deu. 27. 17. If there be a curse for him that remoueth the marke of the land, then how is he ac∣cursed which by a false oath shall take away house and land, Mat. 25. 43. if there be a curse against those which cloath not the naked, what shall become of those which by their periury strippe those that are cloathed, Ex. 23. 4. if we must deale well with our enemies Asse, how ill doe they▪ deale which vpon their oath giuing in a false euidence, shall make himselfe an Asse and send him a begging: A man is knowne to be his fathers sonne by his manner of go∣ing, they say, he hath his fathers gate or going, Ep. 5. 2. why walke in loue, as he hath loued vs: 2. by following his fathers quali∣ties, 1. Pet. 1. 16. Be ye holy as I am holy. 3. By his speach now, God hath sworne in his Psa. 8 9. 35. holynes and will not lye, and therefore let a false oath neuer defile our breath, let this poyson neuer infect our heart or touch our tongue. As Gods name is profaned, when the rod of pride being in mens mouthes, they strike God and despight him with their oathes, so againe this may be done in speach without an oath, as first when we profane his word, or any thing which his word speaketh of him, and againe when we doe so slightly speake of his workes, that there by no glory is gotten to his name. Gods word is profaned, when profane men vndertake to meddle with it, and to be pratling of it, for now there is a ring of gold in a swines snowt and a pretious pearle muzled vp and downe in the myre; this serueth to reproue bad ministers, for if they
shalbe like bad minstrels, which sing one thing and play an other, not consonant to that they sing; if like Shepheards they shall haue a good voice, with which they acquaint their flocke, but not feet as good guides to goe before them, if extrinsecally they take heed to their flockes, but not intrin∣secally to themselues, as the Act. 20. 28. Apostle aduiseth; then doe they dishonour God and his word, for in respect of God, they make him like a goate which is fed with leaues, that is, with words, and in respect of his word, they clippe the cre∣dit of it, for they would not haue beleeued (as it is in the Lamen∣tations) that the aduersary and the enemy should haue entred into the gates of Ierusalem, for the sinnes of her Prophets, and iniquities ofb Lam. 4. 12 13. her Priests. This made a madde fellow desire a bad-liuing preacher to teach him a nearer way to heauen, then that which he had pointed out in his sermons; for he did not thinke that to be the nearest way, for that he did not goe that way him∣selfe; this made Origen to giue full scope to his eyes to bring forth flouds of teares, for after hee had committed a grieuous offence; comming into an open assembly gathered together to heare the word of God, and seeing none present to ex∣pound it, he steps vp into the pulpit, and being vnprouided, did thinke to speake of that text, which after hee had opened his Bible, should first present it selfe to his view: now the place of Scripture which he light vpō was this: vnto the vngodly,c Ps. 50. 16 17. said God, why doest thou preach my law and takest my couenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest to bee reformed, and hast cast my words behind thee? Whereupon calling his sinne to remembrance, and saying within himselfe truely, that Gen. 27. 20. which Iacob said vntrue∣ly to his father Isaac, concerning the venison, the Lord God hath brought this text to my hand, and therefore did I find it so quickly; surely the holy Ghost had a finger in it, and would haue me keepe my mouth, as it were vvith a bridle, be∣cause I haue sinned against heauen; he clasped his booke, this rebuke did breake his heart, and he was full of heauinesse, his spirit vvas in perplexity vvithin him, and his heart vvithin him was desolate, his tongue did cleaue to the roofe of his mouth, and did comment vpon the Text onely vvith sighes and teares. Secondly this serueth to reproue such people as vvill bee
talking of Scripture, and haue the pure vvord of God in their mouthes, vvhen as yet they are not washed from their filthy∣nesse, Ex. 19. 10 God would not deliuer his law before the people did sanctifie themselues, will God haue them sanctified before they heare it, and will hee haue the vnsanctified busie their tongues about it. The word of God is cleane, and desireth to come out of a cleane vessell: Mat. 9. 17 it is new wine, and would not be out poored out of old bottles; it is good seed, and would spring out of such, as haue broken vp their fallowed ground.g Tit. 1. 15. To the pure are all things pure, but to them that are defiled, and vnbeleeuing, is nothing pure, but they pollute that, whichh Hag. 2. 13. in it self is pure and cleane: As the polluted person did the sacri∣fices, for therefore were the sacrifices called vncleane, as being vncleane in themselues, as Mat. 1. 7. the blind, or broken, or maimed, or hauing a wen, or skiray, or scabbed, or else offered by vncleane persons, andk Leu. 22. 22. by such as had mindes & consciences polluted; circumcise ther∣fore the heart, as the Eagle casts her bill, and the adder slipsl Deu. 10. 16. off her old skin, 1 Cor. 5. 7. purge out the old leauen; as the serpent spues vp his poison, cast away the old man, Mar. 10. 50. as the begger did his old cloke, when he was to speake vnto Christ: Deu. 6. 7. then talke of the word of God, when thou tarriest in thy house, and as thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest downe, and when thou risest vp, otherwise thy good words are but splen∣dida peceata, and thy lewd life, as a bad string, bringes thy good words, as sweet musicke, our of all tune, they are an abomination to God, he cannot suffer them, his soule ha∣teth them, they are a burden vnto him, and he is weary to beare them. Againe Gods word is prophaned, when men abuse it to charmes or any sorcery whatsoeuer, when hauing lost any thing, they will haue a siue and a paire of shieres, then by repeating a certaine place of Scripture (which I will not re∣peate, for let no man know that knowes it not;) they thinke to find out the finder, when hauing the tooth-ach, or being forespoken, or prickt with a thorne will haue a Paracelsian character, or a blessing, or Pater noster, said for their cure. Colloquintida ranke poison, did make good nourishable meatep 2 King. 4. 41. for the Prophet, but these men on the other side, with good food doe poison themselues.
As Gods word is prophaned, when we turne it to a bad vse, so also, when wee make no good vse of it, the speaking of Gods mercies, should restraine vs from sinne, as the very name of a father, did Gen. 27. 12. Iacob from subtlety and lying, till Re∣beccah his mother did egge and draw him to it, and as the speaking of a good Gē. 39. 8. master did Ioseph from adultery, when his mistrisse spake vnto him day by day to commit it: the speak∣ing of Gods correction of other should be a direction for vs, and paternes pensiled out to vs; not that we should insult ouer them, but aliena insania fruentes, consult against our owne misery, if we can speake of others woes, and not grow wise, if we cannot take a pearle out of the serpent, or a good stone out of the toads head, or gather with the Bee sweet hony out of the bitter weeds, if we doe not draw the better, when we see one horse whipt in the teame, if we cannot make vse of their death, by whose life a man could reape no benefit: If we can read or speake of Gods iudgements on 1 King. 22 34. Ahab and 2 King. 9. 33. Ieza∣bell, and yet gine our selues to oppression, if reade or speake of his proceeding against Act. 5. 5. 10. Anaias and Saphira, and yet giue our selues to lying, if we doe not set a memorandum on his pu∣nishments and marke his spitts with our starres, if we reade them and there an end; if we bring them forth of our mouthes as vntimely fruit, which dieth assoone as it is borne, then doe we prophane the word, and so take Gods name in vaine, and may be taxed with the vngodly to whom God said, Ps. 50. 17 thou hast cast my word behind thee, quoties legis, toties negligis, thou doest no sooner getit, but thou doest forget it. This as it serueth to condemne the negligent and carelesse, so most of all, such as make a mocke of Gods word, and will not beleeue it; and secondly, such as make a iest of his word, and delight to make themselues merry with it. The first sort are they, which sitting in the seate of the scornefull contemne the word, and tead religion vnder their feet; of whom Dauid complaineth, when he saith, the proudy Ps. 119. 51. had him exceedingly in derision, because hee studied the law of God, whom 2 Pet. 3.  Peter chargeth with this, that they said, where it the promise of his comming? they said because the world had continued so long, it should still continue as it had done with∣out alteration, and as when Gē. 19. 14 Lot said vnto his sonnes in law,
Arise get you out of this place, for the Lord will destroy the City, see∣med to them, as though hee had mocked; so tell these of the iudgement day, they say, there is no such matter, they bee but words, and words are but winde, where is it? let it draw nigh, that we may see it: and though it were so that others should perish, yet there shall no harme happen vnto vs, Wee haue made a couenant with death, and with hell are wee at agreement, though a scourge run ouer and passe thorough, it shall not b Es. 28. 15 come at vs. The second sort are they, which make the word of God their minstrell, which sport themselues with scripture, and thinke no other mirth so cordiall vnto them, such a one was he, who, as though he had been borne with inke in his mouth, did so soone foule his paper with Pruritanus. Lastly Gods word is profaned, when wee will hurt the truth, which is done many wayes: First when we maime the sentences, as the diuell, when he alledged the 91 Psalme, cuts off these words, Mat. 4. 6. to keepe thee in all thy waies; and the Pope, who when Christ saith, Mat. 26. 27. drinke yee all of this, scrapes out all, and regards not all, but saith the Priest shall drinke for all. Secondly, when wee adde vnto the word, as the Iewes did traditions, by which they Mat. 15. 6 made the commandement of God of no authority, as for example, the law was, no leper might come into the Temple; the tradition of the Pharisees was, that if they vncouered the roofe of the Temple and let him downe, as the porters vncouered the roofe of the house, Mar. 2. 4. and let downe the palsie man and set him before Iesus, this was no trespasse, no transgression: whereas the Le. 13. 46 truth was, that no leper should be in the Temple, whither he did come in, were brought in, or were let downe, and therefore though Vzziah did come cleane into the Temple, yet when God did stricke him for vsurping the Priests office, and when the leprosie did rise vp in his forehead, Azariah 2 Chr. 26 19. 20. the chiefe Priest, with all their Priests caused him hastely to depart thence, and he was euen compel∣led to goe out, because the Lord had smitten him. Thirdly, when wee alter some word in it, as Alcumists would change the substance of Mettals, like them who take Mat. 27. 46. 47. Ely, for Elias, and as they, who to get honour to the virgine
Mary, in stead of hee translate, shee Gen. 3. 15. shall breake thy head, as they which in our Ladyes Psalter (for so they tearme it) attribute that vnto the Virgine, which the holy Ghost doth attribute to the Father and the Sonne, and as they, which thinking men are not so subiect to sinne, as though they were bond-slaues of Satan, translate prone vnto euill, in stead of euill, when the Scripture saith, the Gen. 8. 21 imagination of mans heart is euill, euen from his youth: there is a worme Clerus, which destroyes and marres Honycombes, and the popish Clerus is like vnto it, which would this way cor∣rupt the word, which is sweeter then hony and the hony combe. Fourthly when we will seeke all the corners of our wits, to colour the Scriptures, because wee thinke that men would otherwise reiect and condemne them, as for example, the Scrip∣ture saith, election is of grace, now say some, if it were so, then God should be an accepter of persons, therefore they thinke to helpe it thus, God chose some because they would be ready to receiue his grace, and so they compose the matter like those, who when they see the Papists doe attribute to much vnto workes, and the Protestants, according to the Scriptures, say, wee are saued by faith, will as men in∣different steppe in, and make a meane betwixt them, say∣ing, faith is the chiefe Piller: Iob takes vp his friends for their too much kindenesse in this case, Iob. 13. 7. 8. &c. will yee speake wick∣edly for Gods defence, and talke deceitfully for his case? and tells them that if they contend for God, and make a lye for him, as one lyeth for a man (for bad cases may be so well handled that they may bleare the eyes of men) they nei∣ther conceiue his Maiesty, nor yet know their owne in∣firmity, and therefore may be laughed at, as Elihu in the person of God mocketh Iob. 34. 31. Iob, if I see not, teach thou me, if I haue done wickedly, I will doe no more, as if hee should say, let me know where I haue done amisse, and I will be ready to mend it: God likes not those nor will euer thanke them for their kindenes, which will lend him false colours, hee will breake those false glasses which doe not represent his owne face. To conclude this point, we hurt the truth, when we adulte∣rate
the sense of Scripture, and change the meaning of it, when we take a wrest to make the tune sound to our key, when as though we had the winde in a bagge, we make it blow with oursayles; when we make it the hindge, and rudder, to turne all about as we please: when we fit it to our fancies, imitating Scyron and Procstes, who fitted the passengers to the bedd of brasse, which they had framed to their owne bignes, if they were to long for the bedd, they cut of their legges for catching cold, if to short they rackt them at length, like those which set Pauls Epistles on the tenters, and would make them walke a mile or two further for their fancyes, then euer the holy Ghost meant to goe, such are they which inuent viperous glosses to eate out the bowels of a text, as quirking heades haue found waies to eate out the meaning of good lawes, which in stead of naturall milke, which the Church giueth out of her two breasts the Old and New Testament, inforce out the bloud of violent interpretation: as he Pro. 30. 33. which wringeth his nose causeth bloud to come out, as this is done at other times so then, when we vn∣derstand plainely that which is spoken by a figure, and contra∣riwise, figuratiuely that which is to be taken in the literall sense, for the first the Pharisees did wrong to the law, who fol∣lowing the bare words defrauded the meaning, & the more they bound themselues to the shew of the letter, the further they were from the truth: As for example Deu. 6. 8. Thou shalt binde the com∣mandements for a signe vpon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets betweene thine eyes, hereby God commanded the meditation and practise of his law, but hereupon the Pharisees got two lists, skroles or peeces of parchment, and therein they wrote the two tables, putting one on their left armes next their hearts, and binding the other to their browes, (which custome the Iewes obserue to this day) and then they thought they might well say with the seruant, Luc. 14. 22. Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded: againe, beware of Mar. 8. 15 the leauen of the Pharisees, and of the leauen of Herod: hereby Christ meant the corrurpt doctrine of the Phari∣sees, the adultery, incest, vnlawfull vowes, swearing, dis∣simulation, and cruelty of Herod; but the Disciples (for in∣deed at that time they had forgotten to take bread) sayd, it was because they had no bread, these are like those simple men, who if they should heare vs say, deuorem hominem,
would by and by gather that we would turne Cannibals, or like the foolish patient who eates vp the paper, when the Phisition bids him take the Recipe, that he prescribed vnto him. For the second, as we must not take that plainely, which is spoken by a figure, for many times the sense of the Scrip∣ture, is against the shew of words, and the shew of vvords a∣gainst the trut: so on the other side, wee must not vnder∣stand that figuratiuely, which is to bee taken in the literall sense; for then we wrest the rule of truth: for example, our Sauiour Christ saith vnto Peter, Lu. 5. 4. launch out into the deepe, and make a draught, here is a Text, say some, to proue that Peters successour, which they say is the Pope, shall catch the great fish of Constantines donation, for they faine that Constantine the great, gaue vnto the Bishops of Rome, the Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction ouer all, but both Ecclesiasticall and Politicall ouer the west parts of the world, and this they say was meant, when he bad Peter launch out, whereas by such gathering, they reape that, which the holy Ghost sowed not; Not but that one text may haue two senses, literall, which the very words vnderstood aright doe import, misticall, when they conteyne a deeper mistery, but the misticall is not knowne to be the meaning, except God himselfe reueales it, for example, Deu. 25. 4 thou shalt not muzell the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne: this is plaine, the cattle that worke must eate, but this litterall sense is but chaffe, the misticall is the corne, and with the Apostles we must Mat. 12. plucke the eares of corne, and rubbe them with our handes. In the first Iacobs roddes are couered with rindes, in the second they are in part pilled, Saint Paul shewes vs the corne, and takes the pilles from it, when he saith, 1. Cor. 9. 9 doth God take care for Oxen? Nay he had a further reach in it, to teach that they who sow spirituall things should reape carnall things: A∣gaine, Ex. 12 4 yee shall not breake a bone of the Paseball lambe, here is a bone, and there is marrow in it, the first is the outward shell, but Saint Iohn Ioh. 19. 6. expoundes this of Christs bones, there is the in∣ward kernell. The first is the foote of Gen. 28. 12. Iacobs ladder next the earth, the second is the top of the ladder reaching to heauen; in the first thy mother and thy brethren stand without, O Christ, and cannot finde thee: in the second with the Disciples they are within, and leane vpon thy bosome, and therefore the first
of these senses must call for the second, as one depth calleth an other. If we goe no further then the' first, with Abrahamsc Gē. 22. 5 seruants we stay with the Asse, that is our foolishnesse at the foot of the hill, but if we goe to the second, with Abraham vve goe vp to the mount, and Eze. 1. 16 with Ezchiell see a wheele in a wheele, the wine of the spirit in the dregs of the letter, but yet withall, we must take heed, wee goe not to a mysticall sense, except we haue the word for our warrant, for Mat. 2. 9. the wise men went no further, then they vvere guided by the starre, and the starre no further then Christ, if vvee straine a text too high, we must know the note aboue Ela is a iarring note, and makes a discord in the Harmony, and if we climbe with Duns his ladder, we may be sure, vve cannot come downe with∣out a fall, if we wrest the truth, vve wrong the truth, and so prophane the word, and contrary to this commandement take the name of God in vaine. As Gods name is profaned, vvhen his vvord is profaned, so likewise, vvhen vve profane any thing which his vvord spea∣keth of him, for as Bishop Latimer vpon the first petition of the Lords prayer, Whatsoeuer is spoken of God in his word, that is his name. First therefore if we profane his bare titles, and abuse his name vnto lying, as Iacob did, vvhen he said vnto Isaac, Gen. 27: 20. the Lord thy God brought it, that is, the venison to my hand, if wee abuse it to coniuring, as the Act. 19. 13 Exorcists, who tooke in hand, to name ouer them, which had euill spirits the name of the Lord Iesus, saying, Wee adiure you by Iesus, whom Paul prea∣cheth: If we abuse it to cursing, as when wee say, God con∣founde me, or God plague him, if we abuse it to blessing, as when we say, God speed you, if we see men working of mischiefe, as though we did make our selues accessary, and as though God would patroniz that wickednesse, they had in hand, and would further their worke, if wee abuse it to colour any im∣pious practise, as doth the Pope in the beginning of his in∣struments, and therefore it became a common by-word among the Germaines, In omine Dei ineipit omne malum, all mischiefe begins in Gods name, then doe we profane his glo∣rious name. Againe, when we profane his properties, as his mercy,
his iustice, his power, his prouidence, First his mercy, if we abuse it, and take thereby occasion to sinne, making it a pack-horse to beare the burden of our sinnes; when we doe not onely hope, but as though hope were out of his wits, we presume, and say, let vs continue in sinne, that grace may a bounde; wee are not vnder the law; but vnder grace, Secondly, His iustice, when we being vncharitable in our censures, condemne it of cruelty, and therefore challenge nothing, in the bloud royall of the valiant conquerour of the Tribe of Iudah; Mat. 8. 32 but suffer the diuell to driue vs head-long, as he did the heard of swine, to the lake of desperation. Thirdly, His power, when we abase it to the state of our infirmities, as the Iewes, who breaking his arme short off, brake out into these words, Ps. 78. 19 Can he prepare a table in the wil∣dernesse, or prouide flesh for his people: Fourthly, His prouidence, when men say, God lets the world goe at hauocke, and though his prouidence bee the nurse to bring all things vp; as his power is the mother to bring all things forth, and thoug the one keepes all things in repa∣rations, as the other sets vp their frame, yet they say, things here below are ruled by haphazard; the heauens med∣dle not with earthly things, Fortune swaies all, though they paint her blind, yet they thinke shee can guide the vniforme order that is in the world, and in all the parts thereof, though they paint her standing on a bowle, and turning with euery winde; yet they thinke shee can rule and welde others how∣soeuer shee be vnconstant and carried away her selfe: Te faciunt fortuna, deam coelo{que} locarunt. Thus while men like beastly Epicures hold this fantasie, that God sitteth in heauen idlely and at ease, and will neuer en∣comber and trouble himselfe with the rule of the world, while they had rather make a false God of Fortune, then acknow∣ledge the truth of Gods prouidence, they attribute vnto God eyes without sight, eares without hearing, might with∣out minde, minde without reason, will without goodnesse, yea, and a God head without properties peculiar to a god∣head, and while they speake vainely of the appurtenances, they take his name in vaine.
Againe Gods name is profaned, when men slightly passe ouer the wonderfull workes that he hath done; if we regard not the workes of the Lord, and the operation of his hands, but speake of them, as if the frequence thereof caused neglect, if we doe not say vnto God Ps. 66. 3. How terrible art thou in thy workes, but make but little reckoning of them, because common cu∣stome hath inured vs to them, then we take his name in vaine. This serueth to reproue those which will not stampe this character, Ecce, euen vpon those workes of God, which are triuiall, as if seeing but a spiders webbe they doe not say, what a wonderfull worke of God is this, that such a simple creature should weaue such nets out of it owne bowels; or seeing but the hony combes, doe not say, what a strange thing is this, that the most cunning Geometrician cannot obserue a iuster proportion in any thing he doth by art, then these silly bees do by nature in the platforme of their buildings: but especially it serueth to reproue such, as will seeke out naturall reasons, of Gods immediate and supernaturall workes, with whom, Mat. 11. 4 Goe tell Iohn what you haue seene, is no sufficient argument to proue the Messias, for they will fetch a reason euen of extraordina∣ry euents, be they neuer so strange, or else conclude, it is but their ignorance of the cause, there is a reason, though their wits be so shallowe, they cannot sound it. Lastly as the name of God is profaned by our words, so by our workes, when speaking like Angels wee liue like diuels, when aliud proponentes, aliud supponentes, like Lillies we be faire in shew and foule in sent, Rō. 2. 24 for now like the Iewes we giue occasion that the name of God is blasphemed; This serueth to condemne such Gospellers' as are Gospelspillers, these blots of goodnes, which vse religion for a fashon, or as a cloake in the raine which they lay away in the house, for others are backeward in drawing nigh vnto God, when they see the lewde liues of such, as make such faire protestations, that a man would thinke, they would run vpon God for haste; let not therefore thy life be like siluer drosse ouer-layd vpon a potsheard, let not thy outside be lambes wooll, and thy inside fox furre, let not thy staple be fine, and thy liuer so corrupt that it putrifie the flesh, if thou speakest of the name of God, and thy good life doth not speake for thee, thy simulata sanctitas, thy counterfait holynes is
double vngodlinesse, for in naming God thou defilest his name, and causest others to say, loe this is the man that acteth so high a part; I like not these fellowes which haue Iacobs voice, which speake as though nothing but Gospell could drop from them; for you see how, as though they had Esaus hands, they bee rough in their dealings, they leane vpon the Lord, and say as they in Michas, Mi. 3. 11. Is not the Lord among vs, and yet they turne aside by their crooked wayes: thus they which shame goodnesse by seeming good, and cause Religion to bee lesse regarded, run with full saile into the breach of this Commandement; but let this suffice, to haue spoken of this hedge or fence extrinsecally, so farre forth as it keepeth out such beasts, as would profane the name of God, now a word or two of it intrinsecally, as it keepeth vs with∣in the grounds of Gods glory, that we haue a care to get glo∣ry to his name. A sinner sits in sinne by consent, lyes in it by working it, sleeps in it by custome, euery one of these must arise, and not arise onely; but as it was said to the palsie man, Luc. 5. 23 Arise and walke: wee arise by eschewing euill, wee walke by doing good, we purchase no greater displeasure by committing ini∣quity, then omitting of duty. The Mat. 25. 26. 45. slothfull seruant, and they on the left hand, are endited and condemned for sinnes of omission, and therefore as this Commandement chargeth vs, that we doe not dishonour God by committing sinne: So on the other side, it warneth vs to glorifie God in giuing, and getting him honour, by our words and deeds, and first in our words by our oathes, for as God, who is the truth not deceiuing cannot be more dishonoured, then when he is cal∣led to witnesse a lye, for in this case the holy Ghost vseth the word, defiling: Leu. 19. 12 Yee shall not sweare by my name falsely, neither shalt thou defile the name of thy God: so can he not be more honou∣red, then when he is produced to testifie a truth and therefore Gods seruice, and a lawfull oath are coupled togither when the holy Ghost saith, Deu. 6. 13 Thou shalt serue him, and sweare by his name: this condemneth the Heretickes Cathari, which affir∣med that it was not lawfull for a Christian man to sweare for any cause at any time, but because one iarring string is enough to bring a whole noise of musicke out of tune, let vs
see here what strings wee must harpe vpon, to make a sweet concorde. First the persons that sweare must bee such as feare God, and eschew euill, for Moses the Captaine of the Israelites pla∣ceth Deu. 6. 13 fearing God, and eschewing euill seruing him in the fore∣warde, the swearing by his name in the rereward, and Saint Paul as though he liked well this mustering of Moses, mentio∣neth the true seruice, he doth vnto God, when hee cals him to witnesse, Rō. 1. 9. God is my witnesse, whom I serue in my spirit: Iob. 16. 17 16. 19. and Iob vseth the like kinde of trayning, when in Marshalling hee first sets out the integrity of his life, then, my witnesse is in the hea∣uin, and my record is on high: the mouth of other, which mag∣nifying themselues vse to say, God is priuy to my heart, he knowes my care, when as yet they are but hypocrites, and full of infection should be stopped, as the lips of the leper, were couered Leuit. 13. 45. according to the law, and if they come publikely to depose, a good Magistrate should rebuke them, as Christ did the vncleane spirit, saying; Mar. 1. 25 holde thy peace and come out. Secondly they must not in this case be voluntary men, but stay for a call, as Abrahams seruant did, whom his masterz Gō. 24. 3 caused to sweare, for a mans forwardnesse in offering him∣selfe brings great suspition, that he is prodigall of his credit, and of his soules health. Thirdly the person called to witnes, must bee the God of heauen and earth, for by him doth Abraham minister an oath, Gē. 24. 3 I will make thee sweare by the Lord, and Ieremy com∣mands it, Ier. 4. 2. thou shalt sweare, the Lord liueth, and therefore the Aegyptians were to blame, to sweare by the life of their King, the Scythians by his throne, and Nouatus, who ministring the Communion to the people, vsed to sweare them by that, they had in their hand, that is, the Sacrament, as the Papists did by their Masse, and by their other Idols; but hee that sweares by Malcham, and that shall say. Am. 8. 14. thy God O Dan li∣ueth, robbeth God of his honour, and giueth too much vnto an Idoll, attributing vnto it wisdome to see into the breast, and power to punish him that shall binde his lye with an oath, and rewarde him that shall sweare in truth, in iudgement, and in righteousnesse, As there are rules for the persons, so for the matter, it must
be a knowne truth, for a man must not sweare that which is false, and he knowes it false, nor that which is true, if he thinkes it false, nor that which is false though he thinkes it true, for a wise man lookes or he leape, Ec. 2. 14 his eyes are in his head, & 5. 1. he is not rash with his mouth, & 10. 2. his heart is at his right hand. Againe we must not produce the name of God, in matters of no moment, but in such as shall be of great importance, marri∣age is a weighty matter, and if a man will not vndoe himselfe, when he tyes himsele fast, if he seekes a godly seede, he must ioyne himselfe with such a wife as is not seperated from God, for men doe not Mat. 7. 16 gather grapes of thornes or figges of thistles, there fore Abraham sweares his seruant in a matter of marriage, that he shall not take a wife for his sonne among the Idolaters, but in a Gen. 24 3 godly family: it is a shame to plaintife and defendant, and a dishonour done to a great man to produce him, either ad testifi∣candum or respondendum in a matter, that is not worth the speaking of, much more shamefull is it for a man to dishonour the great God in calling him out of heauen, and making him waite in matters of no weight, to serue where his humour shall place him: let therefore other meanes, Ex. 18. 22. as inferiour Officers, end smaller causes, but let God haue his glory, as another Moses, in determining doubtfull matters, when they shall be of great importance. As we must bring glory to God by our oathes, so by our speach, without oath first in speaking of his word, when leauing the booke that is clasped vp to the Lambe and the Trinitie; our tongues are occupyed in his statutes, so as on the one side God shall not haue cause to complaine on vs, as of the Iewes, Hos. 8. 12. I haue written vnto them the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing, & on the other side man shall haue cause to giue vs the cōmendation, which S. Luc. 24. 15 Luke doth the two disciples going to Emmaus, who as they went did not busie their tongues about slandering or vaine words, but talked of the death and resur∣rection of Christ. Secondly in speaking  his nature, of his name, as Dauid naming  glory, Psa. 50. 1 the Lord, euen the most mighty  two is∣ciples naming Iesus  Luc. 24. 19. of Nazareth a Prophet mighty in
we speake of Kings, we make their names glorious, when the 1. Cro. 29 26. Scripture mentioneth the death of King Dauid, it maketh fower wheeles whereon the height of his honour did run, Da∣uid had reigned ouer all Israell super totum Israelem, super, there∣fore he was a superiour, 2. he reigned, therefore hee was a principall superiour, 3. not a superiour or King of an infamous Kingdome, as Ogge the King of Basan, but ouer Israell, a Countrey which if God Ios. 12. 24 had fashioned the world like a Ring, as he did like a Globe, might haue been the Gemme of it, 4. not Regulus ouer part of the Kingdome as the one and thirtie Kings before Dauids time, 1. Kin. 12. 17. 20. and Rehoboam and Ieroboam, who suc∣ceeded his sonne Salomon, and parted the Kingdome, or as the three sonnes of Brute, among whom their father parted this Iland, or as one of the seauen Kings which were in England in the reigne of the Saxons, but an absolute Monarch, super totum ouer all Israell: so when we speake of our gratious King Iames either in our priuate instruments, or in his Letters Patents, we make him glorious in his Titles, Iames by the grace of God of Eng∣land, Scotland, France and Ireland King defender of the faith &c. so in styling a noble man we doe not derogate from his honour in barring or abasing his titles, and shall we not then make his name glorious, who is King of Kings, God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, as to fay with Abraham, Gen. 24. 3. the Lord God of the heauen, and God of the earth: the King of Israell, Iudge among the heathen, Lord of hostes with addition of euery other stile whatsoeuer, by which the Scripture doth set out his glory: so likewise must we glorifie God in speaking of his nature and properties, as of his mercy, to say, there is mercy with God, that he might be feared, there is iustice in God, for he rewardeth euery man ac∣cording to his workes: power and vengeance belong vnto God, for he is a consuming fire, by which he takes away all the vngodly of the earth like drosse, as hee did the Sodomites: there is prouidence and great louing kindnes in God, by which the Lyons, being sauage beasts, became men in humanity to∣wards Dan. 6. 22 13. Daniell, when men, which are kind by nature, became sauage beasts in cruelty against him: by which the flame was martyred with spending her heat, when the three Dan. 3. 25 children, as so many Salamanders, were in the fire: Againe we must set out the glory of God, in declaring his wonderfull workes,
euen before the sonnes of men, for if the builders of Babell did thinke to make themselues famous by making the Tower; shallGen. 11. 4. not God get him a name by the workes of his hands? now all the workes of God are wrapped vp in three large volumes; the heauens, the earth, and the sea, the heauens declare the gloryPsa. 19. 1. of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy worke, what a thing is this, that the Sun should reioyce as a Gyant to runPsa. 19. 5. Iosh. 10. 13. his course, and againe, that it should stand still as in the dayes of Ioshua, goe backe as in the dayes of Ezechias, and beingEsay. 38. 8. Luc. 23. 45 euer bright, should lose it light as at the passion of Christ? The earth is full of the goodnes of the Lord; what a thing is this,Psa. 33. 5. that it being founded vpon the seas, and prepared vpon thePsa. 24. 2. Iob. 38. 5. floudes, and being poysed in the iust proportion by line and measure, should abide stedfast, when the high mountaines, which doe as it were imbosse the earth, may seeme able to shake it, ouersway it and tumble it into the sea. They that goe downe to the sea in shippes see the wondersPsa. 107. 23 of God in the deepe, is not the Whale a wonder in nature, thatPsa. 104. 26. takes his pastime in it? is not the ship it selfe an artificiall wonder, that Merchandize should goe frō countery to countery in such a woodden conueyance, if we doe not speake of these and all his other workes (for his name is stamped vpon them all) to his glory, we doe in speach, though we sweare not, take his name in vaine, as God must win glory by our words, so by our deedes, when being transformed into the image ofMat. 17. 4. Christ, we shine before other like lights, as the face of Christ, when he was trasfigured on the Mount did shine like the Sun; therefore mindes and soules are likened vnto Lampes, because we should shine each vnto other, superiours to in feriours, in being talking lawes and walking Statutes, inferiours to supe∣riours, in being like the tree in Genesis, faire to looke vpon,Gen. 3. 6. 1. Pe. 3. 1. euery one oweth good example as a due tribute, that God may haue the glory due to his name, and thus much of this fence or hedge both ad extra and ad intra, as farre forth as it keepe out beasts, and keepe the good Christian within the boundes of Gods glory. The binder of this hedge is the rodde of Gods Iudgements, the Lord will not hold him guiltles that taketh his name in vaine. The sinne of the blasphemy hath been so odious, that euen
ciuill authority hath set sharpe censures vpon it, Henry the first and Maximilian the Emperour, set fines vpon their heads, which should open their mouthes to sweare vainely, the grea∣test fines vpon the greatest persons, as being not onely guilty of the sinne it selfe, but of the bad example they gaue vnto other. Ludouicke, commonly called Saint Lewis, caused the lips of blasphemers, to be seared with an hot yron: Philip the French King did punish this sinne of blasphemy with death, yea though it were committed in a Tauerne, where many wise men many times forget themselues. But if any did binde two sinnes together by binding a lye with an oath, few nations had any pitty on him. The Aegyp∣tians did strike of his head, because thereby faith and truth a∣mong men might be decayed; in this case the Scithian did suf∣fer death, and he that made proofe of periury should haue his goods. The like did Philip an Earle of Flanders, decree for the precinct of his dominion, King Edmond before the Conquest, (as Gregory the 9. in another place) gathered a Councell at London, where he made this law, that periurers should be sepa∣rated from the company of God, and our law (as I haue read) is, that if a false verdict giuen by twelue men bee found, the twelue men be attainted, and their iudgement shalbe the same that is appointed for petty treason, their medowes shalbe ared vp, their houses broken downe, their woods turned vp, and all their lands and tenemets forfaited to the King: but lawes of men are like cobwebs, little flies hang fast, great flies breake forth. But let men winke at this sinne of blasphemy, of periury, and suffer it to goe scot-free, yet God will not put it vp so, the the periurer sinneth against God, and who shall pleade for him. It is reported in the Acts and Monuments of the Church, and Mr. Foxe takes the story out of Eusebius, that when Narcis∣sus, a good Bishop of Ierusalem, intended to accuse three nota∣ble malefactors of their misdemeanors, they (dealing as that lewd husband, who hauing disordered himselfe abroad, lost his mony at dice, and wasted his goods, and now thinking his wife would be in his toppe, comes home and begins to chide first) thought to preuent his accusations by accusing him first,
and laying a grieuous crime to his charge, and to get credit to their accusation, each of them bound it with their seuerall oathes; one wishing to be consumed with fire, if it were not true: an other to die of some grieuous disease, the third to loose both his eies; Narcissus seeing three to one was oddes gaue place; but what became of these periured fellowes: the first was consumed by casulaty, of a sparke of fire, he, his fami∣ly, and all that he had: the second was taken with a strange sicknesse from top to the toe, which brought him to a mi∣serable end, the third seeing Gods iudgements vpon his bre∣thren in euill▪ confessed the fault, for which he continually shed such abundance of teares, that he wept out his eyes. In latter time within the memory of man, the eleuenth of February, Anno 1575, A certaine woman (her name was Anne Aueries) forswearing her selfe at a shop in woodstreet of London, praying God shee might sinke where shee stood, if shee had not paid for the wares shee tooke, fell downe pre∣sently speachles, and with horrible stincke died. Thirdly this serueth for our instruction, to teach vs to sift our words, to let them be prius ratione, quam prolatione, prius ad limam, quam ad linguam; for the tongue is placed neare vnder the braine and vnderstanding parte, as at the feet of her school∣master, that it might not run before the wit, and the heart is counsailor to the tongue, that it might haue a good guide aboue and beneath: sport thy selfe with oathes, thou makest sport with Iud. 17. 30 Sampson who will pull the house about thy eares: set thy selfe against heauen, and curse God: thou dealest with fire, which will burne all that touch it, Heb. 1. 7 he maketh his An∣gels a flame, & 12. 29. and himselfe is a consuming fire; hold vp a staffe, the dogge is afraid, here God holds vp his rod, here a Lyon roareth in the forrest, and who will not bee afraid, here is a snare set, and he will not take it vp, vntill he takes the blas∣phemer in it. Againe this serueth for confutation of such, as make no reckoning of an oath, as Lysader, who being charged with the breach of the league, whereunto he was sworne in Miletus, answered, tush, we may goe beyond men and beguile them with oathes, as with aples and trifles, we traine and deceiue little children: againe such, as though they thinke they must
keepe touch with others: yet they thinke, they may breake their oath with Infidels, as Thyestes in the Poet, Ego vero fidem neque ded infidel cuquam, neque do: as though Gods Maiesty did depend on mens deserts, and they might abuse his name to wrong those, which do not giue God his right, 3. such as hood themselues with Hypocrisie, who haue a double heart, whose hearts and tongues are not made of the same flesh, who vse congruity in thought; but in word commit solecisme, whose mouthes belye their hearts, as their fingers belye their mouthes, who harken to Gregory the 13. who sending cer∣taine tokens to such as were to be reconciled to him, did set downe in them this goodly poesie, fili, da mihi cor & sufficit: such a one was he which said, iuraui lingua, mentem iniuratā gero, I meane as truely, as a man vpon his death-bed, though I speake as falsely, as one that maketh Almanacks. 4. Such as patronize this sinne with some cunning shift, as that Cap∣taine, who hauing made a truce for certaine daies, brake out in the night, saying that truce was made for daies, and not for nights. And that Romane Souldier, who being taken pri∣soner by the Carthaginians, & dismissed by Hannihall, vpon oath giuen to returne againe to the Campe, craftely lest his sword behind him, and being gone a little way, returned backe to the campe to fetch his sword, and now thinking he had per∣formed his oath, neuer meant to come there againe: but the Romanes sent him backe againe, as a periured person, for that they thought an oath was so to be performed, as he, to whom the oath was made, did vnderstand the promise. Lastly this maketh against the Pope, who dispenseth with an oath, yea with the oath of allegeance, which Subiects make vnto their Prince; the law of God bridles the hands from working trea∣son, n touch not mine annointed: of our selues wee forbeare toPs. 105. 15 touch that which is annointed, but if a Caueat be put in, wee are the more wary: in these words are both these, touch not mine annointed: It bridles the mouth that we speake not ill of the King, Ex. 22. 28 thou shalt not speake euill of the Ruler of thy people: It binds the heart not to imagine euill against him, Ec. 10. 20 Curse not the King, no not in thy thought, for the foule of the hea∣uen shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall declare the matter: If the eye of Inquisition could extend so farre, the
Common law would punish treason in the very heart, the Ci∣uill law punisheth with death, euen the very thought of bring∣ing the Prince into any feare or danger, if it can any way be sifted out, when Hest. 2. 21 the two Ennuches Bigthan, and Teresh were attainted, there was no more put in the inditement then this, they meant to lay hands on King Ahassuerus, their meaning be∣ing found by inquisition, they were both hanged on a tree. In the French Academy I read of a Gentleman of Normandy, who confessed to a Franciscan Fryer, that he once was minded to haue killed King Francis the first, but afterward was angry with himselfe, that such a treacherous thought should enter the doore of his heart: the Gray Fryer gaue him absolution, but yet went and discouered the matter to the King, who sent the Gentleman to the Parlament of Paris, there to bee tryed, where hee was by common consent condemned to die, and afterward put to execution. A man would thinke here were binders enough to tye Subiects to true obedience, when the law of God bindeth, the law of man bindeth, when feare of punishment bindeth: but besides these their owne oath bin∣deth, which makes the corde more then threefold, that is not easily broken; yet the Pope saith, breake these bonds a sun∣der, and cast away these cords from you, compasse or imagine the death of your King, leuy warre against him, adhere to his enemies, giue them aide or comfort within or without the Realme, I will discharge you of your oath and fealty, I will licence you to withdraw your oath of allegiance to take armes against him, yea to lay violent hands vpon him, occi∣dite or excidite, kill him, or ill him, deponite a thron, or exponite pe∣riculo, depose him from his throne, or expose him to danger, thus an oath or any other thing to the contrary notwithstan∣ding, subiects shall haue law to lift vp their heeles against their head, vnder whose feete they should lay downe their liues. But I may say vnto the Pope in this case, as Moses to the Rebels, Nū. 16. 7. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, Yee take to much vpon you yee sonnes of Leuy: and as they in the Gospell, but more iustly, Mat. 2. 2 By what authority doest thou these things? and who gaue thee this authority: thou hast no commission to dis∣pense with an oath, no power to discharge a man of it, thou blasphemest in saying, thou wilt free him that breakes it, Mar. . 1 Who
can forgiue sins but God onely? though thou perdon, God will pu∣nish, though thou doest promise faire, God will pay home, and condemne him as guilty, that taketh his name in vaine. The fourth Commandement. Exodus 20. 8. 9. 10. 11. Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabbath day: Sixe daies thou shalt labour, and doe all that thou hast to doe: but the seauenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt doe no manner of worke, thou and thy sonne, and thy daughter, thy man-seruant, and thy maid-seruant, thy attell▪ and the stranger that is within thy gates. For in six daies the Lord made heauen and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seauenth day. Whererefore the Lord blessed the seauenth day, and hallowed it. IT is written of the Lacedemonians, that by cōmon ex∣ercise they could behaue thēselues souldier like in the campe, but knew not how to vse the time of peace, so many haue stil to husband their busines, & to trade in their crafts and occupations on the working daies, but are to seeke how to vse the Sabbath a time of rest; & therefore God in this cōmandement would teach vs a lesson, with which cōmon vse is not acquainted, Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it holy. The words containe, 1. A charge. 2. Seuerall reasons to induce vs to put the charge in execution. In the charge wee are to consider, 1. The matter giuen in charge. 2. The persons to whom the charge is giuen. The matter giuen in charge is, to hallow the Sabboth, which consisteth, 1. In resting from our owne workes. 2. In labouring in the seruice of God. The persons to whō the charge is giuen, are either Superiors, and they more priuate, as Parents & Masters, More publicke, as Magistrates, Or Inferiours, whither they be home bred, as children thy sonne or thy daughter. seruants thy man-seruant, thy maid-seruant. or forenners the stranger that is within thy gates. The reasons to induce vs to execute this charge are
1. Gods bounteous liberality, in giuing six daies for dispatch of our owne busines. 2. Iustice which should be in man, in giuing euery one his due, it is Gods day. 3. Gods owne patterne, he resteth the seuenth day. 4. The benefits that ensue vpon obseruing it, that is the blessing of God, he blessed &c. In it thou shalt doe no manner of worke: there be opera, fortunae, ulp naturae: workes of our calling, workes of sinne, and workes of nature, from the first we must abstain the seuenth day, from the second, euery day, from the third, not by cōpulsion on any day. Deu. 5. 14 God would haue all our Cattell rest, by name the Oxe, and the Asse, I say in this, as Saint Paul in an other case, doth God take care for Oxen? had God respect properly to the cattel, or doth he not speake it rather for vs, to teach vs to rest on the seuenth day, on which the cattel cannot be imployed in any labour without the seruice of man? 2. Sam. 7. 2. Dauids care was not to dwell in a house of Cedar trees, whiles the Arke of God remained within the curtaines? Luc. 7. and Iairus is as much commended for building a Synagogue, as others in their couetous humours are blamed for demolishing Churches, leauing nothing but rude heapes of stone; but though this be a worke of so great commendation, yet in the law is a Caueat put in, that such a good worke be not performed on the Ex. 31. 13 Sabbath day, or any thing then taken in hand, that belongs to the Tabernacle: Mat. 26. 13. The good worke of Mary Magdalen, in powring a box of oyntment on the head of Christ, shall be spoken of for a memoriall of her vnto the worlds end; so on the other side the with-holding of her oyntment on the Sabbath day is set downe to her commendation, that though she and the other Mar. 16. 1 Mary Iames his mother had prepared sweete oyntments to annoint the dead body of Christ, yet they came not to the Sepulcher till the Sabbath was past, but rested that day accor∣ding to the Luc 23. 56. Commandement. Here-upon Cantus a King of this land, not full 32. yeares before the conquest, ordeyned that fayres, Courts, and world∣ly workes on that day should be forborne, and in the 4. yeare of King Henry the 2. the common Councell of London, de∣creed, that nothing should be bought or sould within the liber∣ties of that Citie, and that no artificer or handy crafts-man
should bring his wares or workes to any person to be worne or occupied on that day, for by this meanes they thought the day to be profaned. Two sorts of people are here to be blamed, the first are they which ouer keepe it as the Iewes which are too nice and too strickt in obseruing this day, and therefore if a man were sicke or diseased they thought that vpon this day meanes might not be Ioh. 7. 23.  vsed for his recouery; for Christ chargeth them with this, that they were angry with him for that hee had made a man whole on the Sabbath day: yea the i Pharisees, in reputati∣onAct. 23. 8. greater then the Sadducees, and sounder in beleefe, the Act. 26. 5 most exact sort, and comming nearest to the law; began to picke a quarrell with Act. 22. 1 Christ, for that his Disciples being hungry did Mat. 12. plucke the eares of corne on the Sabbath day: they find no fault for plucking the eares, for this the law permitted,n Den. 23. 25. but to plucke them on the Sabbath day this they thought a point next the worst, nay more then so, if a house were on fire, they thought on this day they might not fetch water to quench the fire, if a vessell did run out, they thought on this day they might not stop it, and as in Prester Iohns Countrey they which receiue the Sacrament may not so much as spitte, till the Sun set, so the Iewes thought that on this day no body might in pub∣licke scratch where it itched. Lu. 14. 5. If an Oxe or an Asse did fall into any pitte, it was lawfull to plucke him out on the Sabbath day, then what an asse was that Iewe, that would not be pluckt out of a stinking pit which he fell into vpon the Sabbath day. But the Iewes went not so farr on the right hand in ouer∣keeping it, but we some of vs in our practise goe as far on the left hand in vnder-keeping it: we doe not so cast to dispatch that we haue to doe in the sixe dayes, but we reserue vntill the seuenth matters which we thinke to be of smaller importance, the Farmer will not now yoake his Oxen or set his Plough for∣ward, but he will saddle his Horse, and speede himselfe to busines abroad: the craftes-man will not be seene to keepe his shop-windowes open, but he can follow his occupation close∣ly within doores, as though God did not see him: but aboue all other the superstitious Sea-faring man deserues most blame, who occupying his busines in great waters, and saying the
better day the better lucke, will neuer set to sea but on a Sun∣day, and so runnes with full sayle into the breach of this Com∣mandement. Againe as we must rest from workes of our vocation; so from workes which are an auocation from God, and this is that which the Apostle saith, he that is entred into his rest Heb. 4. 10 hath also ceased from his owne workes as God did from his, figures of this resting from sinne was the land of Canaan called a rest because Israell ceased from the bondage of Egypt, from trauaile in the Wildernes from feare of enemies that rose vp against them: againe the resting the seuenth weeke, the seuenth moneth, the seuenth yeare, the seuen times seuenth yeare, which was the yeare of Iubilye, and this seuenth day should be as salt to draw out our inward corruption, to fet and consume and eate out the concupiscence of the whole man: the Iewes might not carry a burden thorough the gates of the Citie on the Sabbath day. Ier. 17. 27. Sinne is a burden, and lyeth vpon the heart it must not on this day enter into the soule thorough the gates of the senses: the flesh is troublesome, our passions are vnquiet, na∣turally al that is within vs al that is without vs rebelleth against the spirit, on this day haue a care that they may be cut off, which trouble you: Qui quiescit, quiescat (for so it is in the old translati∣on: Englished in the Geneua, thus, Eze. 3. 27 he that leaueth off, let him leaue) so let him that resteth from the labour of the body, rest from the sinne of the soule, but our Tauernes in townes Alehouses in countrey, the Kings high waies abroad, our owne streetes at home, doe too truely witnes that the diuell hath more seruice on the seuenth day then all the sixe dayes besides, whereas the Prophet Esay would haue vs on this day to haue an eye to our thoughts, words and deeds when he faith, Esa. 58. 3 not doing thine owne waies, nor seeking thine owne will, nor speaking a vaine word: and this is to celebrate a feast vnto the Lord, when neither the soule is vexed inwardly with the slauish workes of sinne, nor out∣wardly with the seruile workes of the world: not that wee should haue a care to refraine sinne this day, and being careles let goe the bridle to iniquitie all the weeke after, for what were it to rest from sinne the seuenth day, and afterward to run ryot, then to rest our selues and our horse a while, that after∣wards we might ride out of the way with fuller course? but an
especiall regard is to be had to this time, which if we ryot out, we may assure our selues that God will sue vs vpon an action of wast, then must one day teach another, this day, the weeke day, that so we may serue God in righteousnes, and holynes all the dayes of our life. As vpon this day we must rest from workes of our calling, and from workes of sinne, so we must set our selues to another taske, keepe it holy, dedicate it wholy to the seruice of God; to rest from our labours onely is to keepe it idlely, and all this while the Asse at the cribbe keepes as good a Sabbath as wee, to rest from sinne onely is to keepe it by halues, and therefore we must goe one step further, consecrate it as glorious vnto the Lord, Esa. 58. 13 call the Sabbath a delight, and delight in the Lord: Not but that we should study to acquit our duties to God on other dayes, and by obseruing his word get him honour, but whereas Num. 28. 9. vnder the law a single sacrifice was appointed for other dayes, two lambes were commanded to be offered on the Sabbath, to shew that on that day men should double their de∣uotion & vnder the Gospell, our Sauiour Christ wrought more miracles on the Sabbath and feast dayes, then vpon any other dayes besides: what religious exercises are to be performed this day, we may learne out of seuerall places in Scipture, especial∣ly out of two Psalmes: the 92. Psalme, for of all the Psalmes that is the only Psalme which beares the title: a Psalme or song for the Sabbath day, as being vsed euery Sabbath by the Leuites, when the congregation was assembled together; and the 95. Psalme which in the liturgy of our Church, wee reade euery Sabbath day before the seuerall Psalmes, which in thirty dayes are appointed to be said or soung in the congrega∣tion. First therefore earely in the morning we must prepare and make our selues fit to receiue the word: Gods word is a lanterne vn∣to our feete, and a light vnto our pathes, but it cannot shine vnto vs, if sinne as a curtaine be drawne ouer our hearts; it is seede, good seede, but cannot prosper if it be sowne among thornes: it is water to wash vs, and therefore we must slip off our sinnes, as we slip off our cloathes when wee goe into the Bath and this is that which Saint Iames saith x lay apart all filthi∣nes, and superfluity of maliciousnes and recieue with meckenes the word that is graffed in you.
Secondly hauing prepared our selues wee must repaire to the Church, and come before his presence: the prodigall child saith Luc. 15. 17. In my fathers house is bread enough: this is our fathers house, in which it pleaseth him to dwell: here is the spirituall Manna to refresh the soule, here is the poole Bethesda, inz Ioh. 5. 2. which the Riuers of life doe spring forth to heale the bro∣ken-hearted, and quench the thirst of these which long after them. Thirdly repairing to the Church, as Christ to Ioh. 4. 6. Iacobs Well, We must bring our pitchers with vs, our mindes and medita∣tions, vessels with which we must receiue the liquour of life; we must not be like Serpents, which haue their bodies in the water, and their heads out of the water, nor we our bodies in the Church, and our heads out of the Church: sleepe not here with Act. 20. 9 Eutychus, as though this house were a nest for dormise, let not thy eies goe a whoring in it, as though thou wouldest make a stewes of it: sit not for a cypher, as though bare hearing were all, both duty and fruit of thy Religion, but let thy eares be open to good aduice, let not thy heart and re∣solution bee shut against it, if thy regard in hearing bee not answerable to thy care in speaking, thou maiest come to Church, and returne without returning to God, and art but as the Salamander, which liues in the fire, and is not made hot with the fire. Fourthly, hauing brought our vessels with vs, euery man must gather Nū. 11. 6 his Gomer full, and take heed he be not crop∣sicke, as the Israelites, which loathed Manna; but still hunge∣ring and thirsting after righteousnes, tarry out the whole ser∣uice, this is that, which is commended in Luc. 2. 42 Ioseph; and Mary, they came to the Temple with the first and went away with the last, doe not therefore touch and goe, sippe and away, but tarry the peace of God, take the Priests benediction, and vale∣diction with you, it is like the blessing of Nū. 6. 24 Aaron, which God commanded, and all the people tarried for. Hauing thus gathered with the Bees the sweet of heauen∣ly flowers, we must by meditation worke our hony-combes within our hiues: Ez. 1. the doore of the inner court shut six daies, must now be opened; the meate, which by speaking was set before vs in a dish, must now by meditation concocct and di∣gest
in the stomacke, and with the cleane beasts chewing theh Act. 17. 11 Cudde wee must still finde a sweetnesse in that wee haue re∣ceiued; When once we begin to bee cloyed with our owne company, I meane with our inward selfe talke, then are wee with the men of Berea to vse conference, for they, when they had heard the word with all readines, tooke their Bibles that that they might trye the truth, of that which was spoken, and laying their heads together, like bundles of sticks, might kin∣dle one an other. Hauing vsed these good meanes of hearing, meditation and conference, we are to pray vnto God, that his word may bring forth in vs the fruit of good liuing, that the worme of security, and contempt may not eate vp the fruit; that God would still water our soules with the dew of heauen in this life, that hereafter we may be translated as glorious plants into his Paradise: I omit here other religious exercises of this day, as the partaking of the Sacraments, collection for the poore saints of God, visitation of the sicke, the sacrifice of thanksgiuing, and also the meditation of the workes of God, the consideration whereof, the forenamed Psalmesi Ps. 92. 4. & 95. 5. would teach vs to be one speciall vse of the Sabbath day, and now I proceed in order of my diuision to the persons to whom the charge is giuen. Thou, that is, thou that art a father or mother, and hast vnder thee son or daughter: thou that art a master or mistrisse, and hast vnder thee man-seruant, or maid-seruant: thou that art a Magistrate, and hast vnder thee proselites and people of an other nation, thou and thou, & thou must haue a care to hallow the Sabbath: and here that in this ranke, they which are Su∣periours haue the first charge; my note is this, that they must begin to their Inferiours, like an Alarum, and be Ier. 50. 8 like the hee Goates before the flocke: they must not be like Mat. 2. 8. Herod, who bade the wise men, Goe search diligently for the childe, and then he would lagge after and worship; but like Gē. 33. 3 Iacob who sets himselfe for most; like Iosh. 24. 15. Ioshua I and mine house will serue the Lord; and Hest. 4. 16 Hester, I and my maides will doe the same: Inferiours giuing more credit to their eies, then to their eares, doe ra∣ther imitate the workes they see their Superious doe, then the words they heare them speake, their deeds are copies, their
copies rules, their rules the shortest cut of teaching, their good lesson neuer doth so much good, as their good life: they are the great wheeles of a clocke, which turne the lesser weeles the same way; they are pillers, Nū. 9. 17 when the piller stood still, Israel stood still, when that went they went, and in the booke of Iudges,q Iud. 16. 29. when the pillers of the house went downe, downe went all; the other parts are distempered, if the head be sicke, if the eye be darke, all the body is full of darknes, and then must the Sunne needs be set in the valleyes, when it doth not shine on the mountaines: And therefore as Caesar neuer said to his soul∣diers, ite, but venite, so should not the housholder say to his family, nor the great man, to those of smaller accompt, goe to Church and hallow the Sabbath, but himselfe be primum mobile, and say; O come let vs goe vnto the house of the Lord; O come let vs sing vnto the Lord, for then doth the breach of this Commandement lift vp the head, when it seeth the sinne and slacknes of those which are aboue them: and in this case well may the inferiour say to those which are aboue them, as the daughter of the crabbe-fish to her mother crabbe, who swim∣ming her selfe backward, (for such is the property of the Crabbe) bade her young one swimme straight forward, to whom shee answered, prae I, sequar, mother goe you first, and I will follow after. Againe, as they which are aboue other, must be a good ex∣ample to others, so must they see, that they which are vnder them follow it, their good example is a bladder, they must see, that they which are vnder them doe swimme by it, that their good life be a glasse for them, and a lead-starre to direct their course; for if thou art a father, it is thy sonne or thy daughter, if a master, he is thy seruant, if a Magistrate, though the stranger within thy gates be not thine, yet is he now with∣in thy liberty, within thy iurisdiction; and therefore Neh. 13. 16. Nehe∣miah carried a hand ouer the Merchant strangers that propha∣ned the Sabbath day: concerning children and seruants, as the Apostle speaking of the children of God saith, Yee are nots 1 Cor. 6. 19. your owne, you are bought with a price, so say I of children and seruants they are not their owne, they are bought with a price, though not with so great a price, as the price of bloud, hous∣holders are not more their owne, then their families are theirs:
now a man must haue a care of that which is his owne, that which Saint Paul saith particularly to Timothy, 1 Tim. 6. 20. serua depositū, will stretch further, a man must haue a care to keepe that which is committed vnto him, therefore Iob 1. 5. Iob offered sacrifice, for his sonnes; first to shew his watchfulnesse, secondly to shew he held himselfe blame-worthy before God, if they had offen∣ded: and the Pharisees most blasphemous are ready to cast this in Christ his teeth, and censure him for it, that his Dis∣ciples in their imaginations were not well ordered: u Thy Dis∣ciples doe that which is not lawfull to doe on the Sabbath day: Mat. 12. 2 thy Disciples fast not: Mat. 15. 2 thy Disciples wash not: the vice of the chil∣dreny Mar. 2. 18 reflect vpon the parents, the sinne of the seruants is the masters reproch, concerning strangers, as the Israelites dwel∣ling among the Aegyptians learned many ill things of them, so on the other side strangers of an other Nation dwelling among vs, must learne good things of vs, and being pecus erraticum, must heare the voice of good shepheards, and be inforced to follow good Gouernours, when they shall see steps before them worthy of their traching. Indeed strangers are further from vs then our sonnes, then our seruants, then our owne Countrymen, but yet are they nearer then beasts, and though they cannot all say, haue we not Abraham to our Father, yet let all goe vp the streame vntill they come to the Fountaines head, they may all say as in Malachy, Mal. 2. 10 haue wee not all one father, hath not one God made vs? but the law prouided, that a man should haue a care of beasts, Ex. 21. 33 of an Oxe or an Asse that it fall not into a pit, shall we then suffer strangers to run headlong to the pit of destru∣ction? the Ex. 23. 4 law prouided, that if a man met an Oxe or an Asse going astray, he should bring him backe againe, shall we not then reduce strangers, when we see them wandring in the broad way, that leadeth vnto death. Besides where is our zeale, if dishonour done vnto God, by any be he neuer such a stranger doth not eate vs vp, and grieue vs as much as if a worme were gnawing on our hear? men are charie of their owne honesty, and cannot indure that any, no not a stranger should wound it, and shall they be careles, if strangers shall put Gods honour to shame and reproach? A good man is grieued, when being in a strange Country hee
shall see God dishonoured, as Paul in Act. 17. 1. Athens, and shall he suf∣fer with quietnes strangers to dishonour God in his owne countrey? If therefore thou being Alderman or any other Ma∣gistrate hast a stranger within thy warde or liberty, yea, though he doth ouer-see thy busines as thine owne eye, or pro∣cure things necessary as thine owne hand, yet if hee doth of∣fend thee, or cause thy bloud to rise by dishonouring God and profaning his Sabbath, haue a plucke at him, or with our Sa∣uiour Christ bestirre thy selfe with a whip, or at least-wise, seeing him dead in trespasses and sinnes, without any hope of quickening, thou being zealous, be like the sea, which will not suffer in it the carcasses of those which are dead, but casts them on shore. Againe as superiours being the foremen in this charge, are thereby taught to begin to others in the obseruation of this day, so in that inferiours are also put in the charge, though subordi∣nate, they are to learne to conforme themselues, and be rea∣dy of themselues, to follow the patterne set before them, to take true stitches out of those samplers, and to say in this, as Gen. 3. 14. Iacob in another case, pracedat dominus, ego paulatim sequar, and as Iob. 23.  Iob, my foote hath followed his steppes: his way haue I kept, and haue not declined: when thy betters beare the lantorne of Gods word, if thou wilt be out of danger, follow them that carry the light, when thou seest their good carriage, doe thou there∣by better thine owne: tu quoque fac simile, Luc. 10. 37. goe and doe thou like∣wise. Nay more then so, because thou art within this charge, though thy superiours faile in the premisses, yet doe thou hold them, liue not now by example but by law, and know that I and my father is no good plea for the sonne, I and my master no good plea for the seruant, I and the gouernour, no good plea for the stranger, that which God saith vnto one, he saith vnto all: euery one shall beare his owne burden, euery fat shall stand on his owne bottome: the excuse will not goe for currant to say I did follow my parents, I did humour my master or dame, the Magistrate did so as well as I: the soule that sinneth shall dye, and there is no respect of persons. Six dayes shalt thou labour. The labouring hand is the staple of the land, and raiseth vp the pillers of it, without which the cordes of the common wealth would soone be loosed, for
our good therefore, God hath giuen vs six dayes to labour, that by taking paine in them we might liue by the sweete of our owne sweat, were it not then great vnkindnes in vs, if we would not allow him the seuenth day? Six dayes. This Commandement doth neither respect our labouring six dayes, (for these first foure precepts enioyne vs such duties as we must performe vnto God) neither yet our ease and rest on the seuenth day; for the substance of the Com∣mandement is the seruice of God, the rest is but an accident that cannot be separated from it, not but that wee must take paine, for standing water soone stinketh, and what are idle persons but a colder earth moulded with standing water? When the housholder saith Mat. 20. 6 why stand yee here all the day idle? He heapeth vp many reasons to induce vs to labour in the Vine∣yard: First, why? as if he should say, you haue no reason to it, it was at the first Gods ordinance, Gen. 2. 15 to haue man take paine, Gen. 3. 19 afterward it was enioyned as a punishment for sinne, Iob. 5. 7. now man is borne vnto trauaile, as the sparkes fly vpward, and while hee giues himselfe to sloth and idlenes the diuell takes his free ease on him, as on a cushion: God called Dauid Psa. 78. 7. to feede Israel, when he was following the Ewes great with young, not when he lay idle vnder an hill, besides what are the effects of idlenes, but either theft, for the slothfull like drones liue by the hony gathered by the Bees, and like vultures prey on carcasses they killed not, one beates the bush and they catch the bird, they sucke the bloud of other men, and become as fat as body-lice by eating vp others brewesse: they tost themselues at their neighbours fire, and keepe no warmth in their owne chimneis, other mens labours are in their houses, they drinke the waters of others cisternes, & of the riuers out of the middest of others welles, or else adultery, for the minde is apt to all vnclean∣nes, 2. Sam. 11. 2. when the man is idle; the minde being voyde of exer∣cise the man is voyde of honesty. Queritur Aegystus, quare sit factus Adulter: in pomptu causa est, desidiosus erat. Besides it weareth strength as rust doth yron, and ouer-much rest makes men not more fit, but lesse willing to take payne, againe the slothfull hand maketh poore, hereby Ecc. 10. 18 the roofe of the house goeth to decay by the idlenes of the handes the house dropeth
thorough: by doing nothing men come to nothing, and enter in∣to the playne high way to Needome, and when a man will be of no calling, he shall be sure that pouerty or beggery will find a calling to arrest him; and therefore in the time of Cat Censorius, when any would be a Citizen of Rome, this questi∣on was not demanded, whence or what hee was, but only they tooke his hands betweene theirs, and if they felt them soft and smooth, they presently as an idle vagabonde gaue him a mittimus, but if hard and knotty they forthwith ad∣mitted him to dwell in their Citie: And if a malefactor were apprehended, whose handes were labouring handes, his punishment should be mitigated though his crime were grie∣uous, but if idle hands, a seuere punishment should be in∣flicted for a small offence: therefore the Lacedemonians would haue labour and sweat, hunger and thirst as the best spices to season their pottage, therefore the anci∣ents paynted the image of vertue girded, therefore God gaue the Israelites but a short time to gather them Manna, for when the Ex. 16. 21 heate of the Sun came, it was melted: therefore might the housholder well say, why stand yee here all the day idle. The elements moue, the heauens turne, the wormes creepe, the fishes swime, the birdes flye, why stand yee idle another reason that the housholder vseth is, the strength and abilitie of those, to whom he speaketh, why stand yee, as if he should say were it so that you were criples or impotent, and not otherwise pro∣uided for, you might lye with Lazarus at the rich mans gate, I would not hasten you forward to worke, but you haue the powers of your bodyes, are lusty and strong why stand yee idle: Pro. 30. 25. the Antes are feeble, the pismires a people not strong, yet are they diligent at their worke, and will you that are strong be negligent? Draco (but his lawes for their cruelty are sayd to be written with bloud) depriued them of life, which would not labour for their liuing: the drones of Hetruria like vnprofitable bees, entring into the hyue and consuming the hony, were expelled from others and reputed as vagabonds, were condemned to ex∣ile, and dealt withall much like as Philip King of Macedonia dealt with two of his bad subiects, he made one of them runne out of the countrey, and the other driue him. In other places they haue had Stafford law, and at Bridewell in our land whip∣ping
cheere, and in the 23. yeare of Edward the 3, there was a statute made that no man vnder paine of imprisonmēt should giue any almesse to any sturdy beggers, that necessity might cōpell them to get their bread with the sweet of their browes. The housholders third reason to induce vs to labour is ta∣ken from the place, here, why stand yee heere idle, heauen is a place of rest, let the world tosse how it list, our rest is pitch∣ed alost, and we shalbe as the Gen. 8. 4 Arke, which when the floud ceased did rest on the mountaine: Hell is a place of torment, there bee heauy fines but no recoueries, they deale in this Court vpon the capias, Mal. 22. 13. take him away, and cast him into vtter darkenes, vpon babeas corpus binde him hand and foote, vpon the Gē. 3. 24 Ne exeat regnum, the gates are kept from egresse, as the gates of Paradise were warded from entrance, though we haue a writ de homine replegiando, directed to the sheriffe to cause a man to be repleued, when he is in prison, yet here is no re∣pleuie, no flying to a Court of conscience for reliefe, no iud∣gement reuersed by writ of errour: This world is a place of labour, where we must weare our bodies, and still be doing some thing, that God may not find vs idle when he commeth, and the diuell may finde vs busie, when he tempteth, and there∣fore stand not idle heere. The fourth reason is drawne from the time: Worke whileu Ioh. 9. 4. it is day, the night commeth when no man can worke: therefore stand not idle in the day time, if thou hast let slip part of the day, if thou hast not sowne thy seed in the morning, yet in the euening let not thy hand rest, stand not all day idle, nulla dies sine liea, if thou sufferest one day to passe without draw∣ing some line, thou maiest say, diem amisimus amici, and hast lost that which cannot be recouered, and called backe againe: on the one side be not an idle person, who being an vnprofi∣table peece of earth, will not doe all that he hath to doe, on the other side bee not too curious in thy worke, but see when a thing is well done, and doe not more then all, hate both these extreames doing nothing, and doing more then need to no purpose, keepe the meane, labour six daies, and doe all, leaue nothing till the seuenth day then to be dispatched, do not more then all, yet doe all, for sufficient vnto the seuenth day is the trauaile thereof.
The seuenth day is the Sabbath of th Lord thy God: wee must giue to euery one that which belongeth vnto him: the seuenth day belongeth to God, therefore we must giue it vnto him: the minor proposition is in the text, the maior in Mathew, Mat. 22 21. and it is an axiome that goes currant without contradiction: Iusti∣tia suum cuique tribuit, whosoeuer therefore conuerteth to any profane vse that which is consecrated to God, robbeth God of his due, and takes his right from him: for example, you shall see this in these three things, the Temple, Tithes, the time of the Sabbath; in the Temple thus, it is Gods house, there faithfull men inhabit, Angels frequent, God himselfe is pre∣sent, it is , the Kings court and greatest Princesse Pa∣lace: and because those merchants in the Gospell did buy and sell in it, they are called theeues, not such theeues as are com∣missioners on Salisbury plaine, which by mistaking a word, take vp such purses as fall in the lapse, for want of sufficient defence, but Den theeues, Mat. 21. 13. my house shalbe called the house of prayer, but yee haue made it a Den of theeues, you haue crept into my right, made a false entry vpon my freehold as great a blot doth cleaue vnto your hands, as if the wildernes had giuen you and your children foode. Againe Tithes and offerings, are appointed and dedicated to the seruice of God, and therefore they which with Dan. 5. 3. Baltha∣zar carrowse in the bowles of the Temple, and the Merchants, which breaking into the Church take away that, which is the Ministers maintenance, & let them sterue at the altar, that serue at the altar, are as bad as the theeues which Christ whipt out of the Temple, and would crucifie Christ again for his coate, God makes them no better then theeues, when he saith, Mal. 8. 3. you haue rob∣bed me, or you haue spoiled me in Tithes & Offerings: so likewise the eternall God, who made time, who Gen. 1. 3. brought light out of dark∣nes, who put difference betwixt day and night, betwixt day and day, consecrated the Sabbath to his seruice, and therefore it is sacriledge to take it vp for our owne vse, for what is sacri∣lgium, but sacrildium, a profaning of that which is holy? Mat. 22. 21. giue therefore as vnto Caesar, the things which are Csars, so vnto God the things which are Gods: giue him the calues of thy lips, the roote of thy heart, the first fruit of thy age, the tenth of thy substance, the seuenth of thy time.
But for so much as six daies are common to all men, and God hath his seuenth seuerall to himselfe, as his owne in∣closure; it would be knowne (that God might haue his due time) which of the seuen is the day that he claimes as his owne speciall right and interest. The Iewes according to Gods institution set apart the Sat∣terday for the seruice of God, and that which wee call Sun∣day was their Luc. 24. 1 first day of the weeke, this they did in remem∣brance of the creation, celebrating that day to giue credit to the greatest worke that euer was before, but as the benefit of Israels deliuerance from the captiuity of Babylon was so great, that it abolished the remembrance of her deliuerance from Aegypt: Ier. 16. 14 It shall no more bee said, The Lord liueth, which brought vp the children of Israell out of the Land of Aegypt, but the Lord liueth, that brought vp the children of Israell from the Land of the North: So the benefit of our deliuerance from the capti∣uity of Sathan, and the rising of Christ from finishing the worke of our redemption was so great, that in respect of this, other benefits are forgotten, this shineth as the Sunne among the lesser starres; and therefore God did change the day, and put it off from that day he did lay in the graue, till the day when by rising againe, he did ouercome death and ope∣ned vnto vs the gate of euerlasting life. And to shew the al∣teration, the Apostles gaue this day the name of Re. 1. 10. the Lords day, Act. 20. 7. they themselues kept it, and 1 Cor. 16. 1. ordained that the Churches in their time should obserue it: this is indeed a day of good tidings: We doe not well if we hold our peace, this is indeed the day which the Lord hath made, we must reioyce and be glad in it, this is indeed a day like that night in Exo∣dusi Ex. 12. 42 to be kept holy vnto the Lord, that day of the Lord, which all of vs must keepe throughout our generations. Great was the worke of creation, and therefore wee must now mount vpward with the wings of nature, greater was the worke of redemption, and therefore we must now soare aloft with the wings of grace; It cost more to redeeme vs then make vs, for in our creation, Ps. 148. 5. dixit, & factum est, hee spake the word, and it was done, but in our redemption he spake, and did, and suffered many things, hee created the world in six daies, but in restoring man hee laboured more
then thirty yeeres: In creating vs he gaue vs our selues, in redeeming vs he gaue himselfe for vs, so that how much he is greater then we, so much is this day greater then that, and more worthily to be obserued in regard of redemption, then that in remembrance of creation, not now to bee altered any more, because there can bee no greater worke then this of re∣demption, nor can so well deserue an cce in the beginning, or Selah in the end to be stamped vpon it. For in six dayes, &c. and rested the seuenth: Longum itr per praecepta breue per exempla, to teach by praecept is tedious, but by example but a short cut: All the people cut downe eueryl Iud. 9. 49. man his bough, when they saw Abimelech cut downe boughs of trees and bare them on his shoulder, to set the holde of the Shechemites on fire: Reason should rule, and to shew that it should beare sway it lodgeth in the midst of the braine, the highest part of the frame of man, but when reason cannot perswade, example will moe; all the reason that Origen did beate into Alexander Seuerus could not so soone perswade him; that Christ was the Sonne of God, as the example of Origen: And the Christians keepe holy the Sabboth day, here is the pre∣cept which should binde vs, especially seeing there is a me∣morandum set vpon it, but if this cannot inforce obedience, yet yeeld to reason, God gaue you six daies for your owne seruice, iudge then whither you are not to blame, if you grudge him the seuenth: if this hedge will not hold you in, ee further whether this be stronger, it is his owne day, giue him his due, if you yet breake thorough take God himselfe for an example, and let this yoake you, that he finishing his worke in six daies (his worke of creation not of preseruation) re∣sted the seuenth: In that God prescribing a law is himselfe an vnprinted statute, and maketh his owne doing a commenta∣ry vpon that he prescribeth, my note is this, that they which teach other, must as well instruct them vita as verbo, bee as well lamps shining, as voices crying, knowing that the Act. 2. 3. holy Ghost discended not in the likenes of tongues alone, or fyre alone, but in the likenes of fiery tongues, and then doe they make themselues Nū. 0. 1. two trumpets, when they lift vp their voice as a trumpet, their life as a trumpet. The vse is this, to trace God by this fragrant odour, and
sweete sent: let the resting on the seuenth day descend from God vnto man, as the oyntment runnes downe from the head by the beard to the border of the garment: he rested, Leuell at this marke, let him be the white whereat you ayme, the streight line to correct that which is crooked, a spectacle from whence you may draw your impression, a Sterne to guide you, and like Bees see you follow your King: if you could take exception against him this reason were weake to perswade, but he is absolutely perfect Mat. 5. 48 be yee perfit, as your father which is in heauen is perfit: say you are singular, and the world on this day doe the diuell most seruice, yet imitate this president Luc. 6. 40 whosoeuer will be a perfit Disciple shall be as his Maister: he rested, here is a thred which reacheth from God vnto man, from the beginning to the end of the way, follow it, you can∣not erre, ne in domo Dedali no not in the laberinth of the world, he rested, follow him, though not passibus aequis, though not in aequalitie yet in qualitie, as fast as you can, and as farre as you may, let him be Doctor, and Ductor, let the example of him that sits aboue the cloudes, di∣rect you, Ex. 13. 21 as the cloude did the children of Israell in their passage towards the land of Canaan, still remembring this that he makes but a bad peece of worke that regardes not his patterne. The Lord blessed the seuenth day, eyther hee thought ho∣nourably of it, for wee are well conceited of that wee blesse, and therefore Laban calles Abrahams seruant, he Gen. 24. 31. Bles∣sed of the Lord, or else hee bestoweth a blessing on them which obserue it: and here wee are to consider that as God giuing a charge to obserue all his Commandements in gene∣rall, bids vs here in the very entrance especially remem∣ber this, much like as if a father should charge his sonne to performe many seuerall duties, but commendeth one vnto him aboue the rest, which hee telles him hee must not forget, so promising his blessing to those which ob∣serue his statutes and keepe his lawes in generall, doth here in the end especially mention a blessing on this, as though God had a greater care to binde vs to the obser∣uing of this Commandement, then any one of the rest. 1. Sam. 2. 22. God had an especiall care of his Temple that it should
not be profaned, & therefore it aggrauated the faults of Esa. 53. 7. Elies sonnes that they abused themselues at the doore of the Taber∣nacle, and therefore our Sauiour Christ, though for meekenes compared to a sheepe, though he gaue precepts of sufferance, Mat. 5. 39 yet when his fathers house was made an house of Marchan∣dize, Ioh. 2. 15. he bestirred himselfe with his whip, but God had not a greater care of his Sanctuary, then of his Sabbath, of the place of his seruice, then of the time when he would be serued; and therefore in the law they are ioyned together Leu. 19. 30. yee shall keepe my Sabbaths and reuerence my sanctuary, now if the Israelites say to Ioshua, Ios. 1. 16. all that thou hast commanded vs, wee will doe, if the Rulers and Elders say to Iehu, 2. Kin. 10. 5. wee are thy ser∣uants, and will doe all that thou shalt bid vs, much more then must wee that are the seruants of God, be at his becke to doe his will, and encline our hearts to keepe all his lawes, but especially that law, which hee shall giue in especiall charge. Blessed the seuenth day: Ioh. 2. 10 The gouernour of the feast telles the the Bridegrome that he kept the best wine till the last, so here the gouernour of all the world, and the Bridegrome of his spouse the Church, reserueth the best and strongest motiue till the last, that if the rest should faile, this might fasten obedience vpon vs: Gen 27. 8 What meanes did Rebeccah vse, nay what meanes did she notse to get a blessing for her sonne Iacob? how did Esau weepe and howle for the blessing of olde Isaac. Gen. 27. 34. Blesse me euen me also my father: hast thou not reserued a blessing for me, hast thou but one blessing my father, blesse me euen me also my father: Hee will not let his father rest before he blesseth him, no more then Gen. 32. 26. Iacob will let the Angell goe before hee blesseth him, he will not leaue him, till he fastens vpon him with his prayers, as the 2 Kin 4. 27. Shunamite vpon Elysha with her hands: here is a blessing not of an earthly but of an heauenly Father, not for our children only, but for our selues also, if we hallow the Sabbath, as God hallowed it, that is appointed it to be kept holy, wee shall drinke of the cup of Gods blessings, and our posterity shall pledge vs. Ex. 16. 27 Some of the people of Israel went out on the se∣uenth day contr y to the Commandement of God to gather Manna but foud nothing, so let men disobey this law, pro∣fane this day, and trade in their callings, when they haue cast
vp their accompts, they shall finde they get nothing: Luc. 5. 5. Peter fisheth all night & catcheth nothing, for Christ is not with him, so they may labour and take pay ne all this day, but gaine no∣thing, for God is not with them. The superstitious seafaring man runnes not the point aright, for neuer setting to sea, but on a Sunday, God will not giue winde to his sayles, and though the winde be a benefit to sayling, yet God conuerteth it to a plague as he did in the prophesie Ion. 1. 4. of Ionas for another fault: say he is brought to the hauen where he would be and his ship well fraught, yet his gaines shall melt as butter against the Sun, and in the end he shall finde he put his wages into a broken bagge. In a word, let euery one that disobeyes this law looke for nothing, but the curse of God, or if hee hath a blessing, let him looke that God will curse that blessing, if hee hath a wife, he shall be afflicted by the wife of his bosome, who should be his helper, if he hath fruit of his body, he shall be afflicted by his sonne, who should be the staffe of his age, if he hath fruit of his ground, God will breake the staffe of his bread, his Manna shall stinke, and he shall finde Colloquintida a bitter hearb in the pottage: but if we haue a care of the Sab∣bath to sanctifie it, the blessings of God shall ouer-take vs, and one shall binde him to giue another, God will not pull in his hand from rewarding or hold it out empty, and as he is skilfull in dirigendo, because he is a perfect Master, pittifull in corrigendo, because he is a louing Father so will he be bountifull in Porrigen∣do, because he giues what he will without abatement of his store, he will display the banners of his fauour, and vnlocke the closet of his benefits, wee shall haue priuatiue blessings which consiste in deliuering vs from euill, we shall haue posi∣tiue blessings which consiste in doing vs good, some in possessi∣on, some in expectation, some in act, some in hope, corporall, spirituall, temporall, eternall, his grace shall preuent vs, & his mercy shall follow vs all the dayes of our liues. Let therefore the end of the sixt day be a bound to ou busines, like the bound on the Ex. 19. 12 Mount, which the people must not passe, like the riuer, which Shemei 1. Kin. 2. 37 must not goe beyond, an Herculis columna, wherein is guen non vltra, no further then thus: let nothing draw our busines without the gates, within which God hath confined it, let not now worldly affayres looke in at our win∣dowes,
if our couetous affections would be to bold, let reli∣gion ouer-rule them, curb them, put them to a non plus, and with checke and frowne keepe them vnder, goe no further, then we are led by this law, as the wise men went no further then they were guided by the starre; let our Omer be filled the sixt day, then set we downe our rest, and gather now no more Manna for refreshing the body, till the seuenth day be past, neuer set vpon that day which God hath set apart for himselfe, let our trading stand still, when it is come to the Lords day, as Mat. 2. 5. the Starre when it came vnto Christ, so God shall blesse vs, and saue vs, and shew the light of his countenance vpon vs, which shall shine more and more vntill it be perfect day, vntill we celebrate an euerlasting Sabbath, and finde continuall rest in Christ Iesus, to whom with the Father and the holy Ghost, three persons and one God, be all glory, power, Praise and Dominion now and for euer. Amen. The fift Commandement. Exod, 20. 12. Honour thy father and mother, that thy daies may be long in the land, which the Lord thy God giueth thee. ON two Commandements, hang the whole law and thea Mat. 22. 40. ver. 37. Prophets. The first, thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soule, and with all thy minde, on this hangeth the first table of the law, as vpon a great nayle of the Sanctuary. The second is like vnto this, thou shalt loue thy neighbourver. 39. as thy selfe, on this hanges the second table, as on another nayle fastned in the holy place: When the loue of God doth carry vs along toward the hauen of happines, we take a good course, as when one riuer runeth towards the Ocean, it goes as it should, but when this doth meete with the loue of our neighbour, as one riuer meeteth with another then there is a current indeed, and we set forward with a maine streame to a sea of blessednes: and therefore as Act. 2. 2. the holy Ghost was giuen from heauen, that we should loue God, so was it giuen on earth,
that we should loue men, and therefore the Scripture maketh 1 Tim. 2. 2 godlynes and honesty to meete together, Luc. 1. 75 holynes and righte∣ousnesse to kisse each other, or rather weaues them together, as o▪ 19. 23: the coate of Christ without seame, that they might not be put a sunder, both of them make vp one perfect paire of com∣passes, which can take the true latitude of a Christian heart, the first like the top of Iacobs ladder reacheth to heauen, thef Gē. 28. 12 second like the foote of the ladder rests on the earth, or rather walkes about in a perfect circle of all such duties, as one of vs owe vnto another: by the first we walke in reuerent regard of all that duty wee owe to Gods Maiesty: by the second in simplicity we serue our brethren, and yeeld to euery callings se∣uerall person, that duty which belongeth vnto him. The first of these I haue already with the helpe of God pas∣sed ouer, to the second I am to set forward at this time, God againe giue winde to may sayles, that I may run the point aright, and let my words be not only like Peters Angle, Mat. 27. which cast into the sea tooke a fish, but like Peters net, Luc. 5. 6. which let downe to make a draught, inclosed a great multitude of fishes. Honour thy father: The words rest your eares on these two heads. 1. A charge, Honor thy father tēporall, as the father of the house, as thy father by Nature, Office, countrey thy betters in place, thy Elders in yeeres, Spirituall, thy Pastor and Minister, which begets thee to God by the immortall seede of his word. 2. A motiue to induce vs to har∣ken to the charge. i. a promise of long life, that thy daies may be long, pleasant and fruitfull habitation, in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee. HOnour thy father▪ A duty so necessary, that Philo the Iew placed this fift Commandement; in the first Ta∣ble, as though wee had not performed our whole
duty to the God of heauen, except wee gaue the honour heere required, to Parents, to Magistrates, to all such as represent the person of God vpon earth. Frst therefore ho∣nour thy father, thy naturall father, because thou art 2 man: Heb. 12.  God indeed is the father of Spirits: and therefore called Num. 16 22. the God of the spirit, of all flesh, and though he made all his workes in six dayes and then rested; yet this resting was from workes of a new kinde, ot of the same kinde, for he that Gē▪ . 7. breathed in the first mans ace breath of life, so that hee was a liuing soule, doth still after a wonderfull manner create the soule in the infusion of it, and infuseth it in creating it; but goe to the flesh, he vseth our parents as instruments of the worke, and they are meanes in framing that part, and therefore should children yeeld honour vnto them. The Scripture vseth diuers Arguments, to draw vs on to the performance of this duty, as the care which parents haue of their children good education, of which the Apostle spea∣keth, when he saith; Eph. 6.  Bring them vp in instruction and informa∣tion of the Lord, bring them vp, this respecteth meate, drinke, and apparell, parents are not like the Rauen which forsakes her young, till they are of colour like vnto her selfe, nor yet like the Kite, which grieueth to see her young in good plight: In∣deed we read of parents, which haue cast out their children, whom the wolues haue nourished, which though it bee not true, yet hath a semblance of truth, for wolues may become fathers, fathers haue become wolues; but these are such as Saint Paul brandeth with this marke, Rō. 1. 30. 1. without naturall affection, but by nature parents, seruant depositum, keepe that which God hath giuen them, and haue a care to preserue the tender bud of their decaying stocke, Againe they bring them vp in instruction, this respecteth ciuility and good manners, nurture helpes nature forward, and though among Iacobs sonnes foure were borne of his maides, et Iacob did so instruct his younger sonnes borne of the lawfull mothers, that they gaue place to their eler bre∣thren,g Gen. 43. 33. the eldest sat according to his age, and the youngest according to his youth. Thirdly, they bring them vp in the information of the Lord, this respecteth the feare of God, they seeke as much to fa∣shion
their mindes to goodnesse, as they are carefull for the comely behauiour of their bodies: Better not borne, then not brought vp, better not brought vp, then not taught, better not taught, then not taught the feare of the Lord: and there∣fore the Apostle ioynes them together, bring them vp in instru∣ction and information of the Lord: but say parents are backward in performing these duties, yet children should be forward in giuing this honour, and though there were no other reason, yet this must be sufficient to driue them to it, they are their parents, by them they are brought into the world, by their meanes they haue their being, without them they had not been: and if Mar. 12. 2 the Lord of the vineyard sent to the husband∣men for the fruit thereof, because he planted it, 1 Cor. 9. 7 for who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit: then euen in this respect (for the Philosopher said, se plantare hominem) should children pay to their parents, that fruit which this Comman∣dement, as a Collect or goes to gather from them: and this is that which Salomon saith, Pro. 23. 22. 25. obey thy father, that hath begotten thee, and dispise not thy mother, when shee is old, thy mother that beare thee. This honour consisteth, 1. in reuerencing their persons, 2. obeying their precepts, 3. in relieuing their wants. For the first, when Heb. 12. 9 the Apostle speaketh of the fathers of our bodies, he speaketh also of giuing reuerence: Among the Lacedemonians, the arrogancy, and saucines of a child, was the cause that one of the Ephories, (men of great place and authority among them) published the law of testaments, by which it was lawfull for euery man to appoint whom he would to be his heyre. And among the Romaines, when the father was dead, the child was not admitted to pleade his fathers will by way of action, but onely by way of request, speaking very humbly, and reuerently of his disceased father, leauing the whole matter to the Iudges discretion, this serued to bind children to haue their parents in greater reuerence and estimation. This reue∣rence must shew it selfe in word and in gesture, in word by speaking submissiuely, and reuerently vnto our parents, as the prodigall child doth vnto his father, who hauing drawne much of his patrimony through his throate, and spent the rest among harlots, so that now he became fellow commoner
with swine; vseth all reuerence in his words; 1. When hee attacheth himselfe, and brings himselfe into his fathers pre∣sence, Luc. 15. 18. I will rise and goe to my father. 2. When hee indites himselfe, Father, I haue sinned against heauen, and against thee. 3. When he iudgeth himselfe, I am no more worthy to be called thy sonne: such a reuerent submission, is an Adamant to draw the heart of an hard-hearted father, and Gen. 32. 24. wrasleth with him according to the pollicy of Iacob, it winneth by yeelding, and the lower it stoopeth towards the ground, the more ad∣uantage doth it get to obtaine a blessing. Salomon, though he were a King, yet speaketh to his mother with great re∣uerence, for when shee is to make a petition to him, he saith vnto her, Aske on my mother, for I will not say thee nay, he that builded the Temple, was himselfe a true temple of God builtg 1 K. 2. 20 with a low roofe, and therefore he disdained not his mother, but giueth her so good words, that shee that beare him might reioyce. This reuerence is shewed in gesture, by vncouering the head, bending the knee, and giuing place; it is written of Thanu a Stoicke Philosopher, that though for his deserts, he was made Consull and chiefe Ruler of the City, yet meeting his father at a banquet, gaue him the highest roome saying, natu∣raeleges in conuiuio debere obseruari, sicut in praetorio ciuiles, in place of iudgement let the order of the Ciuill law be obserued, but at a place of merriment, let the law of nature goe before it. How reuerently did the foresaid Salomon, carry himselfe in his gesture toward his mother, when shee came to desire a Request of him, 1 K. 2. 19. the King rose to meete her, and bowed himselfe vnto her, and sate downe on his throne, and he caused a seate to bee set for the Kings mother, and shee sate at his right hand: this hee did in token of reuerence, and to giue good example to other; neither let the child count this any disgrace, for now it is true that Aristotle saith, honor est in honorante non in honorato, and the more we abase our selues before our parents, the more we increase in honour both before God and men; and the Ps. 128. 3 chil∣dren which like olyue branches stand round about the table shine, like the seuen starres, which goe about the pole brighter then the rest. c Cursed then be Canaan, cursed be Ham, and the wicked
nation of the Canaanites that proceed of him, for when his fa∣ther ouercome with wine was vncouered, (for drunken po∣ters keepe open gates) in the midst of his tent, hee had no re∣uerence as Shem and Iapheth, but in token of derision and con∣tempt tolde it his brethren, let Adoniahes bad carriage against his father King Dauid, be still remembred to his euerlasting shame, for when his ather is growne old, he gets a gard to set forth his estate, and exalting himselfe saith, Kin. 1. 5 I will be King. So did the sonne of King Henry th second. for when his father ioyned him with him as King, and at his coronation renounc∣ing the name of a King for that day, did as Sewer serue at the table, my father, saith he, is not dishonoured in attending on me, for I am both a King and a Queenes sonne, and so is not he: Euilmerodach, (as the Hebrewes report) went further then thus, for he vsing his father Nabuadnezzar, very irreuerently after he was dead, drew his body out of the graue, burnt it to ashes, parted the ashes, put them in foure seuerall purses, bound them to foure Aegles neckes, and caused them to flye to the foure quarters of the world. The Scites a barbarous people, yet held the very Sepulchers of their fathers in great reuerence, in so much that when Darius seeing them flye before him, would know how far they would flye, they answered, to our fathers Sepulchers, vnto which when thou shalt approach, O King Darius, thou shalt see wee set not so much by the life of the liuing, as bones of the dead. What an euill sonne then was this Euil∣merodach, who himselfe would worke that cruelty the like whereof the Barbarians to dye for it would not suffer their enemies so much as to attempt? But I pro∣ceed. The second point of honour required in children is to obey their parents precepts, and to suffer themselues to be led and guided by them, in matters of marriage men are commonly carried by affections, their choise is not so much led by vertue and religion, as by gaine or pleasure, their flesh sleepeth not, while their wines are chufing, as Adam slept while his wife was Gen. 2. 21 making; this makes them like those, whom they soone mislike againe, and to take wiues, as men doe flowers, which they cast away, when they are once withered: but Isaac in match∣ing
himselfe is well content to be at his fathers disposition, for otherwise Gen. 24. 3. Abraham had reckoned without his host, whē he sent his seruant to take a wife vnto his sonne Isaac, and the seruant would haue cast a doubt of Isaac as well as of Rebecca, but he sayd onely what if the woman will not come with me? he makes no question of Isaac, for he saw before, Geu. 22. 6. how obediently he went with his father to the Altar, though he saw no burnt offring, he perceiued that he shewed no semblance of dislike, though hee saw no reason of the thing commanded. Mordecai was not father, but in stead of a father to Easter, yet being made Queene, Est. 2. 20. she was obedient to him that had brought her vp. This serueth to reproue. First those children, which shaking off their fathers yoake, slatly deny their obedience. Secondly those which promise fayre, but are slacke in performing, pat∣ternes of both these, we haue in the Gospell by Saint Mathew; for of the two sonnes, which the father bids goe worke in his Vineyard, Mat. 21▪ 28. the elder sayd, I will not, yee afterward he repeuted himselfe and went, the younger sayd, I will sir, yet he went not: in the one is a deed without shew, in the other a shew without deede, worse are they, in whom is neither deede nor shew of obedience; such were those graceles waggestringes in Terence, Clitipho and Clinia, of which the first, when his father Chremes giues him good counsell, to wit, that he should not giue him∣selfe to Wine and women, that he should resist the beginning of euill, for that by continuance it gathereth more strength and more, and will hatch if her eggs in time be not broken, O saith he, Quam iniqui sunt patres in omnes adolescentes iudices, qui aequum esse censent nos iam a pueris ilico nasi sens &c. is not this a prety matter, that our fathers would haue vs in our dotage, before we are past our nonage, shall not we take our swinge, as well as they did, when they were of our yeares the crafty old fox, telles me now that I should make vse of other mens harmes, ne ille haud sit quam mihi nun surdo narrat fabulam, I wis little wots he what a deafe eare I lend to all his talke, let him say what he will, I will doe as I list: here is true patterne of a child past grace, to whom truth is vntoothsome, because it treadeth downe his owne likeing, to him I send other chil∣dren to schoole, but as that cunning Musition, who set his
schollers to an ignorant and homely minstrell, but before hee sent them out, he bad them take this lesson with them, see you shunne your masters doings, the matter of his songs, the man∣ner of his playing, his lessons, his fingring is naught, so when you see graceles Clitipho pensiled out vnto you, see you follow not his floting iumpe not in his steps, he treades too much out∣ward, and will not be vnderlayde, yet make this vse of such carrions, gather hony out of their weedes, by their enormi∣ties learne to correct your owne, otherwise goe ye not after them, fashion not your selues like vnto them, be not as 1. Sam 2. 25. Hophni and Phinehas the sonnes of Eli, for they obeyed not the voice of their father, therefore 1. 5. 4. 11. the Lord slew them: harken rather what Saint Paul saith, Eph. 6. 1. Children obey your parents, but hee ad∣deth; in the Lord, obey your parents in the Lord, for parents loose their right to be obeyed when they command against God. Luc. 2. 51 ver. 29. Our Sauiour Christ went downe with his parents to Naza∣reth, and was subiect to them, but yet preferreth his dutie to God before any dutie to them, and therefore he saith, Heb. 12. 9 knew yee not that I must goe about my fathers busines? Wee haue fathers of our bodyes, and of them we haue esse naturae, our being in Na∣ture, we haue a father of our spirit, and of him wee haue esse gratiae, of the one our being, of the other our well being; both these we call father, we obey both, so long as they both inioyne the same duties, but when they command contraries, and he whose sonne thou art by nature, will haue superioritie ouer thy faith, and lye in thy way as thou art going to God, in this case Mat. 23. 9 call no man your father vpon the earth, for their is but one, your father, which is in heauen: now goe from thy father as Gen. 12. 1 Abraham from his fathers house, now Luc. 14. 26 hate thy father, as charitie it selfe doth exhort, now let thy holy carelesnes make thy father thy footestep. The third thing wherein this honour of children consisteth, is in supplying their parents wants, if they be in case able to re∣lieue them, to raise their fathers out of the dust, when they are impouerished and fallen in decay, and cannot see the riuers, nor the floudes and streames of hony and butter; this doth very nature teach, for we see that all boughes doe incline and bend themselues toward the roote, from which they tooke their originall, and more then so in sommer time receiuing from the
roote leaues and flowers and fruite, doe in winter time let them fall againe to the fatting and nourishing of the roote: The Storkes, (and Pliny writeth the same of the birds Meropes,) doe feed their▪ dammes when they are old, because their dammes did feed them when they were young; if Nature worketh thus in creatures which haue life without sense, and sense without reason, shall not Nature and grace doe the like in children, which besides life and sense, haue a reasonable soule? The good nature of Ioseph, shall be remembred to his great com∣mendation, Gen 6. 29. 31. who after that for honours sake he had gone to meete his father comming into Egyt, had his next care that hee might dwell in the land of Goshen, the fatt of the Countrey: and the naturall affection of that daughter shall not be forgot∣ten, who seeing her father had his iudgement to be famished, and that none might be suffred to bring him meate, did giue him sucke with her owne breasts: On the other side to blame were the Iewes, who disanulled this law, for it is written in their Talmud, a man is bound to honour his father and mother, vnlesse he did vow the contrary, and ac∣cordingly Hubaldus, as Gratian noteth in the decretals, would not helpe his mother in her neede, for he had vowed he would not: too blame were the scribes and Pharisees, whom our Sa∣uiour Christ reproueth for this, that they dispensed with children which neglected their parents though they stood in need of their supportation, so as they would giue (as they vse to say) to the Church, Mar. 7. 11 as though the commandement did not rather driue them to their parents care, then to the Priests Corban. In a word to blame are all such children as be∣ing fat vpon earth, and seeing their Tabernacles to florish, are ashamed of their parents when they are filled with pouertie, when Opus, and Vsus, knocks at their doores, when they are brought to a morsell of bread, and drinking of the beggars dish tast the smart of needy want: which without all pittie and compassion will suffer them still to goe to the fountaine for their best cellar, to the ground for their bed, to the gate for their bread, to the brokers shop▪ or I know not whose wardrob for cloathes, to couer the nakednes of their bodyes, these I say, because they will not raise their parents out of the dust, and lift them vp from the dung-hill, run into the breach of this com∣mandement,
honour thy father, and thy mother: The mother is the weaker sex, and commonly most doteth vpon her children, which maketh her looke for lesse honour, and them lesse to esteeme her, therefore there is expresse mention made of the mother, honour thy mother, and Deu. 21. 18. Moses speaketh of harkening both to the voyce of the father, and voyce of the mother, to shew it is as well the mothers dutie to instruct her children, as it is the childrens part to submit themselues, as well to the one as to the other; nay more then so in Leuitius, the mother hath the Bedels seniority, and though she be the iunior yet hath the first place, Leu. 19. 3 yee shall feare euery man his mother and his father, that none might take exceptions against his mother, or thinke himselfe exempted from her iurisdiction. This serueth to reproue such sonnes as, being without natu∣rall affection, are ready to hold their mothers short, when the Church-yard hath the length of their fathers bodyes, such as empayring their mothers true titles, are ready to turne them out of doores; such beastes are like young Kites, who when their dammes haue hatcht them, taken payne and gone about the campe with much danger to bring them meate to feede them, doe not withstanding, when they are growne strong, beate them with their wings, will not suffer them to eate of their prey, but with their bill and with their wings expell them from their nest. I neede not speake here against Parricides, there are few Christians growne so barbarous, except some moth, which destroyes the cloth wherein it bred, or some few vermin, which eate into the flesh wherof they came, or some Salamander, which being a long while nourished in the sire, at last quencheth it, or some worme, which being bred at the foote of the tree, and growing with it, at last killes it, or some frozen snake in Aesop, which intoxicateth and infecteth him with poyson, who warmed her in his bosome: such a monster in nature was Nero, who caused his owne mother Agrippina, to be slaine and ript open, that he might see the place where he lay in her; little bet∣ter were the Bactrians, among whom was such in humanitie, that when there parents, were sicke or old, they threw them to dogges to teare them in peeces: Caspij a people in Tarti nourished dogges of purpose to doe the like peece of seruice,
here in England in the daies of persecution, I know not whether I should more cry out of the cruelty of the persecutors, in com∣manding children to set fire to their parents, (which in the reigne of Henry the 7. 1506. one Ioane Clarke the only daugh∣ter of William Tilsworth, and afterward the children of Iohn Scriener, were enioyned to doe with their owne hands) or of the vnnaturall fact of the children in obeying this cruell com∣mand. Iacobs children though they were not guilty of this sinne by committing the fact, yet might haue been somewhat charged with it, for omitting that comfort which they might haue mi∣istred to their father, for when Iacob saw his sonne Iosephs ati-coloured coate all imbrued with bloud, he was euen at deaths doore and sayd, Gen. 37. 33. it is my sonnes coate, a wicked beast hath deuoured him: Ioseph is surely torne in peeces, whereupon hee rent his clothes, put sackcloth about his loynes, would goe downe into the graue vnto his sonne mourning, and mourne for him as long as he liued, yet none of them sayd, be of good cheere, thy sonne Ioseph liueth, this coate was but dipped in the bloud of a Kid, the worst that hath befallen thy son is this, he is solde to the Ishmalites: but nature it selfe doth so much ab∣horre the sin of parricide, that me thinkes I haue a Supersedeas to meddle no more with it. If you would know the reason why children run into the breach of this Cōmadement is the turning of the cōmandement topsie turuy, for therefore the sonne doth not honour his father, because the father doth honour his son, that is, doth not correct them but cocker them, for therefore is 1. Sam. 2. 29. Ely said to honour his sonnes, because he gaue them but light rebukes for heauie sinnes, and the quantitie of the punnishment was not answereable to the qualitie of the offence: Heb. 12. 9 wee haue had the fathers of our bodyes (saith the Apostle) which corrected vs, and we gaue them reuerence; first he speaketh of correction, and then of reuerence, as though reuerence would not fol∣low except correction as an vsher did goe before it, what was it that caused Adoniah to deale so treacherously with his father, as to vsurpe the Kingdome but this, 1. Kin. 1. 5. 6. his father would not dis∣please him from his childhood, to say, why hast thou done so? will you keepe meate well sauoured, yet will yee neur salt it, will you haue sprigges sprout well, and yet will yee neuer loppe them?
can children haue list in age to liue as they should, and yet you giue them libertie in youth to liue as they list? cast away cor∣rection, the childe becommeth rude, as Ex. 4 3. Moses rodde cast from him turned to aserpent, but bring it forth it makes him bring forth good fruite, as Num. 17. 7. 8. Aarons rodde layd forth brought forth buddes, brought forth blossomes, and bare ripe almondes: there∣fore say not the rodde causeth blewnes, chiding discourageth, breaking is violent, the yoake is heauie, but with the birch bend children in youth like the birch, least you bewayle them in age, for their wilfull irreuerence and stubborne disobedi∣ence: you parents many times iarre and snarre, you men and wiues sometime bestow blowes each on other, leaue off, re∣serue them for your children, they will doe your sonnes and daughters more good: correct them, make them know them∣selues, they will be a ioy to your hearts, they will be your glory, and as the Apostle speaking of the faithfull saith, Heb. 11. 16. God was not ashamed of them to be called their God, so you neede not be ashamed of them to be called their father, but let them run riot and take their owne swinge, dote vpon them and dis∣please them not, they will grieue your hearts, and assure your selues that so many sorrowes shall afflict you as a due punnish∣ment in age, (if 1. Sam. 4. 18. with Elie you doe not breake your neckes before) as you suffered vices in them, in their youth they wil proue like a generation of vipers, which rend and teare their mothers sides, and the dishonour which they will doe vnto you, will be as a sword passing thorough your hearts: thus hauing stept a little aside to shew the cause of childrens disobedience, I re∣turne to the charge. Honour thy father, that is thy master for he is paterfamilias, the father of his houshold, and therefore 2. Kin. 5. 13. Naamans seruants call their Master father: and on the other side the Master (as Mat. 8. 6. the Centurion) calles his seruant sonne, for the word  signifieth sonne as well as seruant, and we may say of seruants, God hath made them little lower then sonnes, as Dauid said of man, Psal. 8. 5. thou hast made him a little lower then Angels, but a little lower, and God accounting seruants as sonnes saith, Col. 3. 24 they shall receiue the reward of the inheritance. The Master hath a care of his seruant to giue them meate in due season, and though he doth not say by and by when his ser∣uant
commeth from the field, Luc. 17. 7. 8. Goe and sit downe at table, yet afterward he saith, eate thou and drinke thou. Ad Pro. 31. 15 the wise and worthy woman for her part riseth while it is yet night and giueth the portion to her housholde, and the ordinary to her maydes, if God doth visit the seruants with sickenes, the Master doth not shut his doores vpon them or send them to an hospitall, but keep∣ing them in sickenesse vseth the best meanes he can for their re∣couery, 1. Sam. 30 13. not dealing as the Amalekite, who left his seruant because he fell sicke, but like the good Centurion, who com∣ming vnto Christ in the behalfe of his seruant saith, Mat. 8. 6. Master, my seruant lyeth sicke at home of the palsie and is grieuously payned, but speake the word only and my seruant shall be healed. Againe he al∣loweth them lawfull times of honest recreation, and will not weare them to the backe, as though they were made for no∣thing but his seruitude: he will pay them their wages at their time concluded on, and not find or frame excuses to discarde them empty, in a word he will so vse them, that if opportunitie serue, they shall feele the sweetnes of their seruice, and his bounty: In regard of the soule, he is a Seraphim to kindle their zeale, and reckoning his seruants as much his, as hee is his owne, hath a care that they walke with their God, and doe not transgresse the limits of honesty, like that noble man, who had for his Impresse, two bundles of ripe Millet bound together with this Motto, seruari et seruare meum est, for the nature of the Millet, is both to garde it self from all corruption, & also to preserue from putrifying those things which lye neare it: thus doth the good Master, and therefore his seruants honour him, but if he should be of a contrary disposition, Psa. 123. 2. yet the eies of ser∣uants, must looke to the hands of their Masters, and the eyes of a mayden to the hand of her Mistresse, a good seruant must be subiect to his bad Master, as farre forth as he may doe him seruice with cleane hands and with an honest heart, and this is that which Saint Peter wisheth, when hee saith that seruantsd 1. Pet. . 8. should be subiect not only to good and courteous Masters, but also to the froward, for then a cleane napkin doth wipe a fowle mouth. This honour consisteth in reuerence, in token whereof 2. Sam. 9. 11. Ziba doth acknowledge, Dauid his Lord, and himselfe his seruant: in obedience, in witnesse whereof the Centurion saith, Mat. 8 9. I say
tomy seruant, doe this and hee doth it in diligence, and therefore Gen. 2 54. Abrahams seruant, when he nath suffered his eies to sleepe and his eie-lids to slumber, and the temples of his head to take a little rest, will not for all intreaties admit for any longer stay, but like an arrow out of a bow hasteth to dispatch the bu∣sinesse whereabouts his master sent him: in faithfulnesse, which caused Gē. 24. 33 Abrahams seruant to preferre his masters bu∣sinesse before his owne necessity, which made Gē. 39. 9 Ioseph true to his master, notwithstanding the inticements of his mistrisse, which maketh many seruants hazarde their own liues for their masters safety. This serueth to condemne such seruants, as will be haile fellow well met with their masters, secondly, such as being bid to doe any thing will giue their master leaue to doe it him∣selfe, or at least murmur and grumble, reason the matter and answere againe; Thirdly, eye seruants, which will doe good seruice, but yet no longer then their masters eye is vpon them, such a one is that seruant in the Gospell, who Mat. 24. 49. in his masters absence doth reuell and take on, as though hee would throw the house out at the window; such a seruant did that fat man meete withall, who being asked, why be∣ing fat hee did ride vpon leane horse, answered, I feede my selfe, but trust my man to feede my horse: Fourthly, such as are treacherous to their masters, and by discouering them, or their secrets doe bring them into danger; but here a question may be moued, how farre forth a master or his secrets may be concealed. We read in Chronicles, that when Richard the third that vsurper did pursue the Duke of Buckingham to put him to death, for tyrants vse to cut downe the staires by which they climbe vp: the Duke in extremity did flie for succour to one Banaster his seruant, vpon whom hee had bestowed great meanes to enrich him: Banaster very carefully conueied him into a Cops, adioyning to his mansions house and there preserued him, but within a while there is proclamation made, that whosoeuer can reueale where the Dnke is, if he bee a bond∣man he shall be infranchised and made free, if a free-man, he shall haue a generall pardon, and bee rewarded with a thou∣sand
pounds, hereupon Banaster, either for feare of danger, which might ensue, if he did conceale him, or hope of gaine which he thought to receiue, if he did reueale him, bewray∣ed where his master was, whereupon he was apprehended, examined and executed: he that writeth this story doth much condemne Banaster as one that betrayed his master, and there∣fore the iudgements of God did follow him, and his as long as he liued, for shortly after his sonne and haire waxed madde, and died in a bores stye: 2. his eldest daughter of an excellent beauty was sodainly strucken with a fowle leapery: 3. his se∣cond sonne became lame and very deformed in his limmes: 4. his younger sonne was drowned in a shallow puddle: 5. he himself in his old age was arraigned and found guilty of a murther, and had been hanged had he not been saued by his Clergy: 6. where he looked for a thousand pounds King Ri∣chard gaue him not one farthing, but as much disliking his doing, said, he that would be false to so good a master would neuer be true vnto any: but let this suffice to haue spoken of the honour due vnto the father of the house, whither he bee Pater or Paterfamilias a father by nature, or a father by office for the good ordring and training vp of those, which are committed to his charge. Besides fathers of the house, which the Philosophers call Oeconomicall, there are fathers of the country, or cōmon wealth called political land these are first our betters in place, as Kings, and all that are in authority: concerning Kings the Scripture calleth them Esa. 49. 23. nourishing fathers, we must therefore honour them, and willingly bend our necks to be subiect to them. The Scripture inforceth this honour by diuers reasons; First from Gods ordinance, Rō. 13. 1. the powers that are, are ordained of God, inde illis potestas vnde spiritus, Pro. 8. 15 by me Kings raigne (saith Wisdome) and Princes decree iustice. Gen. 1. 2 In the beginning the earth was without forme, void, and darkenes was vpon the deepe. Ante mare & terras, & quod tegit omnia coelum; Ʋnus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe: Quem dixere Chaos, rudis indigesta{que} moles. Now lest the body of the common wealth should bee like the confused Chaos, when hight and depth, light and darknesse were mingled together, God ordained a power, a right of
rule and gouernement, which superiours haue ouer inferiours, a King ouer subiects, there is some shew of this superiority and subiection in things without life: for in musicke, which consists in voyce and sounds, the counter-tenor seemes to com∣mand ouer the base, and oyle doth swimme aboue other li∣quours, in things without reason, for in the earth the Lyon is President among the beasts, the Eagle among the birds, in the salt and fresh waters, the Whale rules in the sea, the Pike in the pooles: and man to whom God hath giuen life, sense, and reason rules ouer all: Hee hath put all things in subiection vn∣dera Ps. 8. 6. his feet, but the King aboue other men as the head aboue the members, the Cedar among the trees, the Sunne among the Starres, and God himselfe among the Angels, this is Gods ordinance, which to crosse is to warre against God, and there∣fore on the one side, Pro. 28. 2 because of transgression, the lande hath many Princes; But Non bene cum socijs regna venus{que} manent, and that which is the same with it, Nec regna socium ferre nec tedae sciunt, Loue and Lordshippe can abide no fellowshippe: many master Pilots when euery one desires to hold the rudder hinder one another, and therefore the common wealth where many will rule, except it be subordinatly, one vnder another; is like Plinies Amphisbaena, a serpent which had an head at each end of her body, and while both striue which should be the master head, the body is toyled miserably, and in the end rent and torne both sometime: on the other side no King is a iudgement, for then the Esa. 3. 6. Prophet sheweth, there followeth confusion, when euery one refuseth to be a Gouernour: and one cause of great disorder, which was among the people of God is noted to bee this; Iud. 17. 6 in those daies there was no King in Is∣raell, and it is noted as a iust wonder that Pro. 30. 27. the grashoppers haue no King, yet they goe forth by bands: for the body of the common wealth which wants a chiefe Rulr is like the body of Poliphe∣mus without an eie, and in such a state men are as fishes Hab. 1. 14 which deuoure one another: to blame therefore are the seditious A∣nabaptists, who liking best an Anarchy like vntamed horses lift vp their heeles against gouernement, but whatsoeuer they teach yet in their rebellion, popular aequality was so burden∣some vnto them, that contrary to their owne doctrine they
had Iohn Mathew to their captaine, & Iohn Alyed to their head, and amongst their diuels, Beel-zebub the chiefe of diuels: I speake not here against free States, which are ruled in com∣mon, not by one Prince, but by the best men, or by the whole people, yet euen amongst these one had the preeminence, as the Consull at Rome for his moneth, the prouost at Athens, each of them  for their weeke, each  for his day, but this I say to the commendation of a Monarchy, that whereas no Aristocraticall or popular estate hath lasted longer then sixe hundred yeares, and few so long many Monarchies haue continued twice as long in the same estate, neither doth any gouernement draw so neere to nature as this herein, be∣cause God hath ordained the King to haue the supremacy, therefore the subiects must honour him: and secondly honour him, because he appointeteh iudges and Magistrates vnder him, 1 Pet. 2. 14. for the punnishment of euill doers, and prayse of them that doe well: for the punnishment of euill doers, and therefore as they carry a ballance in one hand, so doe they beare a sword in the other, with the one they iustly weigh litigious and con∣trouersed causes, with the other they punnish malefactors, and maintayne the innocent, they are phisitions of the com∣mon wealth, and minister Potions to rid out distemperate humors, for the wicked are as it were the oppression of nature, the surcharge and surfit of the stomacke, which cannot be eased, except such inhabitants be spued out of it: if any bad member be bred in the body of the common wealth they cut him off, as surgeons cut off certaine limmes in the body, which are infe∣ctious—ne pars sincera trahatur: if bad members come from other places as Seminaries, and Iesuites, doe from Rome, they be like the bird Ibis, which destroyeth the serpents which come out of Libia into Aegypt, very hurtfull to their Country: Aaron and his sonnes doe consecrate their hands to God in the holy slaughter of sinne, but when Aarons vrim and Thummim will doe no good, then comes Moses with his rodde and staffe, when the tongue cannot perswade, the rodde doth compell, and when the sword of the spirit meetes with such yron harts, that it enters not, but is rebated, then doth the arme of the Magistrates bruise them with a rodde of yron, and breake them in peeces like a potters vessell.
As the Magistrate is the Comet of the guilty, so is he the refuge of the innocent, his seate is a shelter to such as are op∣pressed, and a sanctuary to all that are distressed; his breast is an Ocean, whereinto the cares of priuate men doe empty themselues, which when he hath receiued, he pre∣sently seeketh to ease them by repressing the violence of such as doe vexe them, and as though there were a writ directed to him from God, much like a fieri facias, he goes about to right those that are wronged: Neither doth a good King alwaies this by Deputies alone, but as though he had receiued an Im∣presse from God, much like the Rowle of Eze. 2. 9. Ezechiell, with this motto of Moses, Num. 11 12. carry them in thy bosome: he himselfe is a guarde vnto his subiects, against catterpillers and cormo∣rants, and bastards fawcons. It is written to the commendation of Marcus Aurelius, that diuiding the houres of the day for the businesse of his Em∣pire, hee allotted one houre to heare the complaints of the grieued, the suits of poore men and widdowes wanting iu∣stice, and that two daies in the weeke; hee would walke a∣broad to see if any person would speake with him, or make complaint vnto him; On the other side, it is written to the discommendation of other persons, that they admitted not those Est. 4. 2. which by their apparell did testifie their mourning. Thus you see the good milke, which Kings as nurces send forth in the streames of iustice, pitty, and compassion: Saint Paul setting out the blessings which we reape by meanes of good Kings, mentioneth especially these three, 1 Tim. 2. 2 Peace, Godlines, and honesty, each of these is a great blessing, peace, whither wee respect deliuerance from enemies abroad, for therefore was Arabia called faelix, because the people liuing in continuall peace, had their townes vnwalled: or whither we respect quiet from discorde at home, it is well with Bees when they make a noyse in their hiues, but it is well with men, when they be at quiet in the cōmon wealth, happy is this land of ours, which hath receiued this benefit by good Princes, hap∣py be the remembrance of King Henry the 7. who ioyned the Roses, the Houses of Yorke and Lancaster together, and so freed it from ciuill dissention: and before that time happy bee the remembrance of King Henry the 2. in subduing Wales vnto
England, though this was done Armorum strepit, but since that time, still twice happy be the remembrance of our gra∣cious King Iames, who with quietnes hath pulled downe the wall of partition betwixt England and Scotland, and hauing come ouer on this side Iorden, hath planted the Tribes of his Is∣raell and people on both sides the Riuers, thus the Riuers goe againe vnto the Sea, and the doue is returned with an Olyue branch in her mouth to the Arke from whence she came forth; and we hope that all three peoples shall long and long, yea for euer dwell in the Tabernacle of peace, and in sure dwellings, and in safe resting places, for their peace sing Te Deum in the highest note, when many other Nations cry Miserere in a mournefull voyce, since the same continent containes them all, the same Kingdome and gouernement rules them all, the same Religion instructs them all, since these three most sure bonds, naturall, ciuill, and religious, knits them all togither, which hath been twisted by our mighty Monarch, and there∣fore surely like to hold out for euer, E 4. 12. a three fold corde is not easi∣ly broken. The second benefit mentioned by the Apostle is Godlines: A good Prince like Canutus before the conquest makes lawes by counsell of his sages, binding his subiects one rule of Chri∣stian Religion, well and aduisedly to hold, not giuing coun∣tenance, either to Iewish, Turkish, Greekish, or Popish Re∣ligion, though all these stand for competition of truth, but onely to the Reformed, driuing his subiects as a good sheep∣heard his sheepe altogither to greene pastures, not dispen∣cing with any, since none are exempted by God, denying a tolleration, either to the cause of Papists, lest it should in∣fect the persons, or to the persons lest it should credit the cause. The third benefit is Honesty: A good Prince hath a care that there be iust and honest dealing betwixt man and man, that he which hath much, setting honesty aside, doth not tyrannize ouer him that hath little, that the fat cow doth not deuoure the leane, and the full eare eate vp the poorer corne, that one doth not by fraude take away anothers land, or by vio∣lence hold that, which is none of his, or conuert other mens goods to his vse: in a word, that men doe not liue like beasts;
but honestly and vprightly one with another: these three I say are great blessings, which we enioy vnder good Princes, and the want of any one of them is a great blemish in a com∣mon wealth, peace without godlines is but security, godli∣nes without honesty, is but hypocrisie, honestie without godlines is but paganisme, and a glistering sinne, neither godlines nor honesty without peace can well bee maintained: Godlines is the summe of the first Table, honesty the Summe of the second, peace an happy manner of enioying them both. Lastly honour the King, for God himselfe honoureth him, in stiling him by his name, for as Patriarch and Prince haue interchangeable names (for the Hitites called Abraham the Patriarch a Prince, thou art a Prince of God among vs: andf Gen. 23. 6 to make euen Peter calleth Dauid the Prince, Patriarke, Act. 2. 29 I may boldly speake vnto you of the Patriarke Dauid) so God and the King haue interchangeably borrowed names; Ps. 20. 9. God is a King in heauen, the King is a God on earth, herein honouring the King, in giuing him his owne name, as Iacob honoured Iosephsb Ps. 82. 6. sonnes, when he said, Gen. 48. 16. Let my name be named vpon them: now as the people honour him, whom the King doth honour, (in token whereof they cryed before Ioseph Gē. 41. 43 Abrech, that is ten∣der father, in token whereof Haman brought Mordocai on horsebacke, after he had arayed him in royall apparel through the streets of the City, and proclaimed before him, (Thuse Hest. 6. 11 shall it be done to the man, whom the King will honour) so must they much more honour the King, whom God doth honour. This honour consists not onely in reuerence, in regard whereof it was not lawfull so much as to laugh in the Court of the Areopagites, and euen the Romaine Censors disgraded a Burgesse for yawning too wide in their presence, not onely in allegiance, which is as well pledged vnto him by the obli∣gation of an oath, as it is due vnto him by bonds of Nature, not onely in feare, in token of all which three, God hath giuen Princes three speciall ensignes of honour, Ps. 21. 3. a Crowne of gold for their sublimity, for which they must bee reuerenced, Eze. 19. 11. a Scepter of righteousnesse for gouernement, for which they must be obeyed; Rō. 13. 4 a Sword for vengeance, for which they must be feared; but especialy, it consisteth in seruing him with
our goods for his maintenance, and with our liues for his de∣fense: with our goods for his maintenance, and therefore though our Sauior Christ wrought many miracles, yet he ne∣uer wrought any about honor or mony; but that about tribute,b Mat 17. rather then that should goe vndischarged, hee commanded a fish to pay it: for this cause Christ doth not say, date, but Mar. 22. 12. reddite, quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari, and Saint Paul saith, Rō. 13. 6 yee pay tribute, as though it were a due debt, and therefore wee must be willing to discharge it. Secondly, this honour to the King must shew it selfe, in seruing him with our liues for his desense: The Bees in their common wealth haue a King, whose pallace they frame as faire in shew, as strong in substance, if they finde him fall, they establish him againe in his throne with all duty, with all deuotion, they garde him continually for feare hee should miscary, for loue he should not. The people 2 S. 18. 3 in the second booke of Samuel would not haue the least hurt befall King Da∣uid, and therefore when they went to warre would not suffer him, though he were forward in offering himselfe, to goe forth with them, but they would put their liues in hazard to saue him harmeles. This serueth to teach euery subiect to doe the best he can for his Princes safegarde, he that is in the place of coun∣saile by all the waies of wisdome, he that is in the seate of iu∣stice, by due & iust execution of the law, he that is in the Priests office by bowing his knees and lifting vp his hands: and not onely this, but to goe further, and say to his King as Peter to Christ, Mat. 26. 35. I will ieoparde my life for thy sake, and though I should die with thee, yet I will not deny thee. Againe this serueth to con∣demne those, who are so farre from putting themselues in ieopardy for their King, that they will aduenture their liues to make him away, as Brutus and Cassius, who slew Caesar in the Senate house, as Simon the Monke who first dranke him∣selfe of the Wassall bowle into which he had conueyed the ve∣nome of a toade, that he might poyson King Iohn, at the Abby of Swinestead. This in latter time condemneth the Pope, who promised earthly and heauenly recompence to Parry for offe∣ring his seruice to kill Queene Elizabeth. It condemneth Do∣ctor Allen, who taught that Princes might be violently hand∣led, deposed from their throne or exposed to danger. It con∣demneth
the Iesuites, who celebrate them as Martyres, who lost their liues in the North, for bearing armes against the Queene. I conclude therefore this point of honour, with that say∣ing of Saint Paul; Rō. 13. 1. Let euery soule submit himselfe to the higher powers: euery one, without respect of persons, not euery body, but euery soule, with respect to a willing minde, to high∣er powers without exception against their qualities, which maketh against the priests in Hildebrands time, who taught the people that they owe no subiection to euill Kings, and though they haue sworne fidelity, they must not performe it, nor yet be accounted periurers for holding against their King; but whatsoeuer they are that beare rule, wee must submit our selues, their will must bee done, aut à nobis, aut de nobis, of vs, or on vs; when their lawes agree with Gods, then wee must be agents, when they are dissonant, then wee must bee patients, if Kings entring vpon Gods freehold will broach a new Gospell, or coyne another Creede, they must not bee obeyed therein, Dan 3. 18 Be it knowne vnto thee O King, (say the three children Sidrah, Misach, and Abednego) that we will not serue thy gods, nor worship the golden Image, which thou hast set vp. He that obeyes a wicked command, is as much to blame, as he that doth enioyne it, yet must we submit our selues to the punish∣ment which shall be laid vpon vs, for that we obey not, know∣ing that bad Kings are tempters, and we must receiue our try∣all with patience. An other sort of Fathers to whom honour is due, are our el∣ders in yeeres, for the Apostle teaching Timothy, how hee should behaue himselfe in rebuking all degrees, calleth them fathers; 1 T. 5. 1. 2 Exhort an elder as a Father, the younger men as Brethren, the elder women as Mothers, the younger as Si∣sters. This the Prophet Esay noteth to bee a signe of ex∣treame confusion; Esa. 3. 5. when the children shall presume against the ancient, and the vile against the honourable, and there fore Leu. 19. 32. Moses giues in charge to rise vp before the horehead, and honour the person of the old man: In token of this honor at Rome the younger sort were wont to leade the elder sort home. Magna fuit quondam capitis reuerentia cani, Inque suo praetio rugasenilis erat.
how were they wont to reuerence a man that had ouerliued the taste of his pallat, the sight of his eyes, the haire of his head, the teeth of his gummes, on whose forehead was figured the mappe of age, in the furrowes of whose face appeared the calenders of death: but sape nigrum cor est, caput album. Some are in their nonage for affections when they are in their dotage for yeares, and are such as Plutarch saith of Sar∣danapalus, 1. Tim. 5. 6. and Paul of a widdow liuing in pleasure, they are dead while they liue, such as Seneca saith of an old man, non ille tam diu vixit sed tam diu fuit, as though being altogether vnprofitable hee had out liued himselfe, told three or foure-score yeares and then dyed, these haue but barely age, and therefore but one step vnto honour, but if they be like flowers, which haue their rootes perfect, when themselues are withering, if with roses they keepe a sweet sauour though they loose their colour, if with the Sun they giue greatest glimpse at their going down, if they be so pregnant and ready to giue counsell, as if many yeares were gone backe againe in the course of their dayes, like 2. Kin. 20 11. the houres vpon Ahaz Diall, if their siluer haires con∣teyning great experience haue more certaine skill then youn∣ger heades Iob. 15. 10. as Elyphaz argueth they haue, if they giue a good example of sobrietie, honesty, discretion, soundnes in faith, in loue and in patience Tit. 2. 2. as Paul saith they should if they haue not only senectutem bonam, but bonum senectutis, the fruites of piety, when the haruest of their yeares is come, then honour them in giuing reuerence Leu. 19. 32. as God commandeth, in giuing eare to them as Iob. 32. 4 Elihu to his ancients, in taking patternes from them, and bettring our owne carriage by following their steps, let them haue all the honour that may be according to the resi∣due of the Poet saying. —sed quibus album Et caput et cor est, sint in honore senes. Now concerning spirituall fathers, these are Pastors and Ministers, which worke in vs our regeneration and new birth, in which respect Paul saith to the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 4. 15. ye haue not ma∣ny fathers, for in Christ Iesus I haue begotten you thorough the Gos∣pell,c Gal. 4 1 and therefore he calleth the Galathians his little children of whom he trauailed in birth againe till Christ were formed in them: honour therefore these fathers first in regard of their cal∣ling,
Mala. 2. 7 for the Priest is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts, not a common Embassador, but legatus a latere, 1. Cor. 4. 1. a disposer of the secrets of God, and as Nicodemus said vnto Iesus, Ioh. 3. 2. Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher sent of God, so they are first Rabbies for their learning, hauing been Doctorum discipuli, before they come to be imperitorum magistri, and sate at Gamaliels feete, before they warmed Moses chayre, they haue not like lapwings run away with some part of their shell on their heads, but stayed at Ie∣richo till their beards were growne and had their Nunc dimittis in the Vniuersity, before they came to exuultemus in the Coun∣trey: Secondly they are sent of God for their license, and their commission is sealed, when Christ saith to his Disciples Mat. 28. 19. goe teach all nations: now hee that contemneth the Embassador despiseth him that sent him, 2. Sam. 10 6. Dauid accompted the abuse of∣fred to his messengers as a dishonour done vnto himselfe, and therefore our Sauiour Christ saith, Luc. 10. 16. hee that despiseth you, despiseth me, and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me: Againe honour them in regard of their message, they bring tydings of saluation, and Rom. 10. 15. how beautifull are the feete that is the comming of them which bring glad tydings of peace, and bring glad tydings of good things? I say not, but they may preach the law, but then they goe plus vltra, they set abroach the Gospell and make the wounded conscience drinke of the water, they may bring their hearers to the brinke of hell, but withall they tell them, they may stand fast in Christ Iesus and looke in, not so much as with a little thrust driuing them downe, whom they see to stand on narrow footing: their message is to tell those that are terrified by the law, that they must accompt Moses as an excomunicate person: to let them heare, like Iohn, Reu. 14. 2. the voice of musicke after the voice of thunder, and 1. Kin. 19. 11. with Elias a soft and still voice after a mighty strong winde which rent the mountaines, and brake the rockes before the Lord, to vn∣binde the chaines of those which are held prisoners, Io. 11. 44. to loose Lazarus and let him goe, in a word with the Gen. 8. 11. Doue to bring an Olyue branch to the Arke when the floud is ceased. Now the first thing wherein this honour consisteth is in ha∣uing the Minister in reuerent regard and estimation, as the Apostle aduiseth, saying, 1. Thes. 5. 1. I beseech you brethren, know them that labour among you, and that are ouer you in the Lord, &c. There is
an hireling, enters in by the doore, but regardes not the sheepe, yet tolerate the hireling, there is a thiefe, which enters not by the doore, and comes to destroy, beware of the thiefe, there is the good shepheard, which entreth in by the doore, and careth for the sheepe, know such a one, account of him, and haue him in singular loue for his workes sake. In the old Testament why Ex. 9. 42 doth God appoint a place to parley with the Priest? why doth God entring them into commons,c eu. 6. 16 make them as his fellow commoners? Nu. 3. 12 why doth he compare them to the first borne, and Num. 27. appoint that the Prince should aske counsell of God, by the mouth of the Priest? why wouldf Le. 21. 67 he not haue the least spot of dishonesty in their houses? why doth he manifest by a miracle, that he is the author of the priest-hood? why (when he would brand the Israelites with a marke of greatest reproch) doth he say, Hos. 4. 4. Thy people are as they which rebuke the Priest? One speciall reason of all this is, be∣cause the Priest should be priced and accounted off by man, as he is esteemed by God: and here letting passe the Prophets, which are called 1 K. 13. 1 men of God, which are said to bee of Gods Am. 3. 7. priuy counsell, which are counted 2 Ki. 5. 8. the glory of Israell: why in the new Testament, are the Ministers called 1 Cor. 3. 9 Gods labo∣rers? why is their 1 Th. 5. 20 preaching called prophecying? why are the hearers said to sit at their feete? one speciall reason was this, to adde more honour vnto them, and make you receiue them with reuerence. To let passe Scripture, had it not been to make the very name of a Priest venerable, they would not in former ages haue chosen their Priests out of their Philosophers, and their Kings out of their Priests: I speake this to the shame of such proude and arrogant Squires, which thinke so basely of their Minister, that he is not worthy so much as to waite vpon their trencher, to the shame of all Atheists, which make as much reckoning of their Ministers as the Aegyptians did of their shep∣heards, Geu 46. 34. euery sheep keeper was an abomination to the Aegyp∣tians: to the shame of all such, as like the dogge will bite the stone in stead of him that threw it, and like Iob 1. 15. the diuell will smite Iobs seruants, when he cannot smite Iob himselfe: The Iewes could say of Christ, Mat. 13. 55. is not this the Carpenters sonne, is not his mother called Mary, are not such and such his brethren and
sisters, so the Gentiles can be content to know their Ministers in the basenes of their birth, in the poorenes of their kindred, in the smalenes of their liuings, in whatsoeuer may any way disgrace them, they will not know them in the worthinesse of their calling, in the weight of their message, in any thing which may make to adde vnto their commendation: God did giue honour to the builders of his materiall Tabernacle in calling them by name, doe not you then dishonour the builders of hisd Ex. 35. 30 spirituall Temple, in calling them out of their name, as 2. Kin. 2. 23. the children called Elisha baldehead neither doe by mistaking a word in stead of Sir, giue them the Sirrha, you know that in re∣spect of themselues they haue a commission from God, & that he who hath a commission from a Prince, be he neuer so meane a seruant, yet excelles the very Nobles in those things where∣unto his commission reacheth, you know againe in respect of your selues, were it not for their Ministrey, you were like Turkes and infidels, neuer shipt with Christ in Baptisme while you are infants, that afterward, you might sayle with him in the pinisse of the Church, and at last anchor in the hauen of happines, you could neuer partake the sacrament of Christs body which should strengthen you in your iourney to heauen, 1 Kin. 19. 6. 8. as Elias hauing eaten the baken cake walked to the mount of God: were it not for their Ministry, you liued in adultery, and had the same comiunction with harlots in wickednes, which now being husbands you haue with your lawfull wiues in ma∣trimony, and by the appointment of God: were it not for their ministrey, your children now lawfully begotten, were illegiti∣mate, were base and therefore euen by the law of the land ex∣cluded from inheritance, happely you thinke I take too much payne in rowling this stone, but considering your contempt, lesse I cannot speake, and presupposing that with Sisyph I shall spend my strength in vaine, more I will not. A second point of this honour is to harken to them and yeeld obedience to their Doctrine: Iob speaking of his glory, saithg Iob. 29. 21. men gaue eare vnto him, and waited, and held their tongue at his counsell, in this respect 2. Cor. 1. 44. Paul esteemed the Corinthians his glory, for that as Gods sheepe hauing an eare-marke they listened vnto him, and therefore he saith, though other 2. Cor. 3.  haue neede of letters of recommendation, yet he needed not, for
when men should heare of their faith, which by his meanes was wrought in them, when they became teachable, this was sufficient certificate for him, there should neede no other epistle, no other hand and seale, they themselues were wal∣king pasports, they themselues were his epistles, letters te∣stimoniall, & the very seale of his Apostleship, whom therefore 1. Cor. 9. 2. he calleth his reioycing: and as on the one side detrimentum pecoris, est ignominia Pastoris, for what greater dishonour can there be to the Minister, then when men shall say, he hath been in such or such a Parish, these ten, twenty, or thirty yeeres, yet his parishioners haue neede of milke, they are vnacquainted with the first rudiments of Christian Religion, they know not what they must doe to be saued, surely he hath not chalked them out the way to heauen, or else there is some great fault in him, God doth not blesse his labours, he spends his strength for nothing, he runs in vaine, without the fruit of that he ran for. So on the other side, the profit of the people is the praise of the Pastor: when men say of him & his flocke, as they did of Octauius and the walles of Rome, for what commendation was this to Octaius, that comming into Rome and finding walles of bricke, at his departing hee left walles of marble, so what honour is this to the Minister, that comming into a Parish, and finding hearts of stone, at his de∣parture like a cunning Alcumist he leaues hearts of flesh, that finding the inhabitants like Luc. 15. 13. the prodigall child a farre off, like Luc. 15  the lost sheepe strayed out of Gods inclosures, into Sa∣tans common; not onely by whisteling, but by crying vnto them, he hath brought them againe to the sheepe-fold: that finding them following the world, the flesh, and the diuell, he hath made them Antipodes, and caused them to run contrary courses to other men: this I say is an especiall point of honour, when people are bettred by their Pastors doctrine, when their words kindle with faith, and vtter with zeale, 1. Sam. 17 49. like the stone out of Dauids sling hath strake the sinne and sinner at the heart, when being before vnprofitable trees, they are now filled with the spirit, and beare fruite on euery bough, and on euery branch. This serueth to condemne such, as Ru. 2. 17. with Ruth will not gleane the eares of corne, with the laborours in Gods haruest, let fall,
which come to Church for fashion sake, or to saue the penalty of the statute, or to finde some Recipe to procure a sleepe, which like Ex. 5. 2. Pharaoh will not harken vnto Moses, though he comes with a message from God, which Es. 53. 1. will not beleeue the Pro∣phets though they speake in the name of God: Luc. 16. 30. which like the rich man makes no reckoning of Moses and the Prophets, which Gen. 19. 14. like Lots sone in lawes, count the denouncing of parti∣cular iudgements but a mockage, and 2 Pet. 3. 4 the generall iudgement but a fable: but especially it condemneth such as resist the truth, 2. Tim. 3. 8. as Iannes and Iambres withstood Moses, such as persecute their preaching which was Alexanders fault, of whom Paul complayning saith, 2. Tim. 4. 15. he withstood our preaching sore, not our person, which had been a breach of charitie, but our preaching, which was a direct offence against piety: it commendeth onely such as get honour to their teachers, by receiuing with meeke∣nes the word that is grafted in them, Ia. 1. 21. which is able to saue their soules. The third thing, wherein this honour consists, is in giuing maintenance, and this must be pro, and contra; first in supply∣ing things necessary for the maintenance of their liues; se∣condly, in replying words necessary to maintaine their credit, when the lewder sort shall goe about to take their good name from them: Concerning the first, before the law, euen in superstitious places as in Egypt, when the famine was great, the Priests Gen. 47. 22. had an Ordinary of Pharaoh, and did eate their Ordi∣nary, which Pharaoh gaue them: If Idolatry fed her Priests, let not the Gospell sterue her Ministers; in Nū. 18. 21. time of the law, God gaue the Leuites all the tenth in Israell, for an inheritance for their seruice, which they serued in the Tabernacle of the con∣gregation, after the law, Saint Paul gaue as strict a charge for tithes as euer Moses did, and therefore he vseth  emphatically. Gal. 6. 6. Let him that is taught in the word, make him that hath taught him pertaker of all his goodes. But some say Act. 18. 3. Paul wrought with his hands, true, but it was to winne Disciples, which otherwise he was not likely to haue gotten, since at that time, false Apostles preached freely to win the fauour of the people. Other say the Apostles were poore, I say these haue the de∣uotion of Iudas, Ioh. 12. 6. who was a theefe, and bare the bagge. Another
saith, he takes no paine, he is lazy, tongue tyed, he is like Ba∣laams Asse, which neuer opened his mouth to speake, but it was a wonder to heare him: but I say tithes are layd forth by publique law, and publique orders must not be priuately altred: A fourth saith, I reape no profit by him, but goe in∣to the Church as an Aethipian into the Bath, who comes out as blacke as he went in: this should as much discourage him from preaching as thee from praying, what a griefe is this vnto him, that his tongue should be the pen of a ready wri∣ter, and thy heart like paper oyled which will not receiue the print of the pen, that his talke should droppe vpon thee, and thou Iud. 6. 40 like Gideous fleece remaine dry: Mar. 14. 68. yet the cocke doth crow, though Peter still denies his Master, and Act. 12. 26 Peter knocketh still, though the damell doth not open vnto him, and Luc. 5. 4. launch∣eth out into the deepe, though he hath laboured all night and taken nothing. Non est in medico, semper releuetur vt ager. Yet the Phisitian hath his fee, though the sicke patient neuer recouers health, for the Lu. 8. 43. diseased woman spent all she had vpon Phisitians yet was neuer the better, 1. Cor. 3. 8 euery man receiueth his wages accor∣ding to his labour, secundum laborem (saith a learned fryer) non secundum prouentum and therefore Paul saith, 1. Cor. 15. 10. I laboured more then they all, not profited more then they all: thus hauing remoued the blockes which some haue stumbled at, when they were going to pay their due tithes, goe on the common rode way. You that are Patrons, be not like the worme Ioh. 4. 7. that smot the gourd, nor like mothes bred out of the ruines of the Church, regard not more Haram domesticam, quam Aram domi∣nicam, doe not crop and girdle the Ministers maintenance, be not such foxes as eate vp sheepe and shepheards both, deale not as Dionisius, who comming to the Church gaue linsey wolsey for golde, for siluer coates, doe not praise learning and lt it goe naked, let not Cleanthes a painefull student grinde, and that for sustenance sake, sucke not as though you were the Pro. 30. 15. two daughters of the horseleach the bloud which your fore-farhers put into the veynes of the Church, despoile not that which they clothed, be not merchants of soules, pull not the forbidden aple, and cleaue not like caterpillers to the fruites of the Church, reduce not tithes to stipends and almes, be not
like Iud 17. 10. Micha in allowing wages, make not your selues golden Patrons by presenting woodden Priests, doe not take sacrum de sacro, and so with Dan. 5. 3. Belthazar carowse in the bowles of the Temple, nor yet sacrum de non sacro, and so rob the Church of her endowments and possessions, say not with William Rufus Church bread is sweete bread, doe not with Iulian the Apostata, take away the Ministers maintenance pretending conscience, for that to much liuing was a burden vnto them and hindrance to their Ministry; but let that heroicall minde be in you that was in Dauid, 2. Sam. 23.  17. who would not drinke of the water that was brought vnto him, because it was fetcht with the venture of bloud, make your best preferment rewards of worth, and 1. Kin. 3. 7. deliuer the whole childe to the true mother: You that are parishoners, Gē. 14. 20. with Abraham giue your Melchizedeek tithe of all, you are the Vineyard of the Lord, let your Leuites eate of your grapes, you Luc. 12. 32. are the flocke of Christ, like good sheepe giue downe your milke, that your pastor who feedes you may taste of it, 1. Cor. 9 9 starue not the Oxe which treades out the corne, least you bring a famine of the bread of life. The Pharisee saith Luc. 18. 12. I giue tithe of all that euer I possesse, doe not you come short of him who comes short of heauen: you that are Ministers, be not contenti∣ous in small matters, but in great wronges, be not too much patient, to the hurt of the Church, Ios. 21. 1. the chiefe of the Leuites demanded their due, when they were not thought of, but by great ouer sight were passed ouer in Luc. 10. 7. the diuision; the workeman is worthy of his hyre, and there∣fore looke for your penny, when you haue laboured in the Vineyard, and require that allowance which is made ouer vnto you as a deede of gift by this commandement. The second kinde of maintenance is in standing for the Mini∣sters good name, when bad men shall broch false rumours of him, and ill will disperse spightfull narrations to disgrace his worth by malice; when the Mar. 12. 2 Pharisees did thinke the Disciples faulty they come and tell their Master, when the Master, Mat. 9. 11. they tell the Disciples, the lynes of Satan boldly open their mouthes with a conceipt of impunitie to speake their pleasure of the Mi∣nister in his absence, setting their tongues to sound nothing but detraction and slanders, croking like frogges in the fen till
he come neare them, but Christ, though he stoppes not the Pharisees mouthes from speaking ill, yet he opens his mouth to reproue them, and to make an apologie for his Disciples, in such a case Rom 16. 4 Aquila and Priscilla stand for Paul, though they doe it with dangering of their owne liues: In the law, Ex. 23. 1. thou shalt not receiue a false tale of any much lesse of thy Minister, thou must not be a nurse of his ill fame▪ but let the reporter see in thy face, that he hath no roome in thy heart, he that opens his mouth to detraction is a theefe, he that opens his eares to entertaine it, is a receiuer, both of them carry the diuell with them, the one in his tongue, the other in his eares: we haue a saying, and it is true, their would not be so many theeues, if there were not so many receiuers, so there would not so many rob the re∣nowne of their Minister, and clip his cridit to make him lighter esteemed, were it not that the heares open their eares to re∣ceiue, and suffer vntrue and malicious reports to get credit among them. To conclude this point therefore, let not the eare be an open Sepulcher, therein to bury thy Ministers good name, but let thy mouth be open to reproue those, which like madd dogges, lay out their venemous tongus and hasten to byte it with their teeth; neither thy selfe pare his estimation, as 2. Sam. 10 4. Hanun did the garments of Dauids Embassadors, neither giue way to such as carry his durt on their tongues, as though their mouthes were Neh. 3. 14 the doung-gate, thorough which the filth in Ierusalem was carryed forth, speake thou well of him alwayes, if it may be done with truth, if it cannot, then lay thy hand vpon thy mouth, and of the two rather harken to him, which in censuring the Ministers makes a bad one good by par∣tiality, and smothes his vnworthines by fauour, then to him which makes a good one euill by malice, and doth disgrace him by enuy: for men will not willingly taste of the fruite, when it shall be sayd, a bad tree did beare it. Thus you see what the honour is which this commandement requireth, you see who the fathers are which haue a charter for it, to each of which we giue the more honour the better patternes they haue been of vertue, not so much honouring them, whose wit hath contriued a plot of preferment, as them, whose worth hath been a stirrup to raise thē out of the dust. There are other; which set in foote for this honour, but their title to it is like that
clayme, which the harlot layde vnto the childe, 1. Kin. 3. 23. who, when she had ouerlayde her owne sonne, made challendge to that which was none of hers, the first and worst of these are they, which being fathers of mischiefe, lordes of misrule, and no∣table in some kinde of villany, as though they were gallant fellowes glory in their sinne, and will, like wartes and swel∣lings in the body, be aboue other, such a one was Nouellius Tricongius, who looked for an honourable place, for that he was able to drinke three pottles of wine together with one breath, and true it is, that in recompence of this good seruice, the Emperour Tiberius made him Proconsull. Other, though not so full of vice, yet as voyde of vertue, being tainted with ambition, seeke the greatest dignities: In warre we honour such as will not turne backes vpon the ene∣my, nor niggardly grudge their bloud when God or their Countrey call for it; such a one as Leonides was, to whom, when his souldiers, as being dismaide, sayd, that the shot of the enemies arrowes was so thicke, that it couered the Sun, then said he, let vs fight in the shade: but Comineus vpon the battle of Montlebery saith, that euen those, which shewed them∣selues most dastardes and cowardes, not only sought after great offices, but also did obteyne them, some, saith hee, lost their offices for running away, which were bestowed on other, that fledde ten leagues further. Thus many times both empty vessels swime aloft, and rotten posts are guilt with adulterate golde, the worst weedes spring vp brauest, & when the twines doe striue in Rebeccaes wombe, Gē. 25. 25 the worst commeth forth and hath the first place: I wish I could not exemply this in some few of our owne coate, of our owne calling, who though they know themselues fitter implements for the belfrey, then to open Gods booke in the pew, or in the Pulpet, though they see men of excellent parts content themselues with a low sayle, and shrowding themselues in willing secresie, like good corne le in the bottome of the heape, till they are called forth of their chosen obscurity, yet doe they put themselues forth before their time, doe iustle for great places doe holde out their cap to eceiue the almes of fortune complaining, if they (Ex. 9. 10. like the ashes sprinkled toward heauen, when God sent botches and sores on man and beastes) be not lift a loft, if they be crossed
or defeated, or brought to a losse in the heate of their chase, Dan. 2. 31 with Nabucadnezzar they dreame of great Images, Dan. 4. 8. of great and strong trees, Gen. 41. 2. 5. with Pharaoh of fatte kine and full eares, the imaginations of their sleepe shew what their dispo∣sition is when they are awake: Iud. 9 15 with the bramble in the para∣ble they will be aboue other trees, 1. Sam 14 13. with Ionathan and his armour bearer they will climbe vp, though it be by the ragged∣nes of the rockes: with the Pro. 30. 28. spider in the Prouerbes, they will ake holde with their handes, and be in Kings pallaces: but while they seeke the greatest dignities they finde the greatest shame, and like Apes when they be clyming they doe the more shew their deformities, for before, some few knew their insufficiency, but now being importunate to be eminent, all the world may see, that they haue pride matched with their vnworthines: but howsoeuer, honour, if it rise not of mens owne worth, of their vertues and knowledge is falsely giuen, is wrongfully taken, and therefore the heathen building a Temple to honour did in such sort adioyne vnto it a temple to vertue, that a man could not possibly get into that, but he must of necessitie passe thorough this. An other sort of chaffe that will be aboue the corne is gather∣good, a man who hauing been good, with a rake and scraped much mucke together, now steps in, and would be garnished with whole poundes of honour, though hee hath scarse one dramme of honesty, hereupon he shoulders for a title, he seekes Knight-hood praece et praetio, he hath Hares feete to goe vp the hill, he posteth for pompe and frothy ostentation, as fast as Iehu hasted forth his Charet, 2. Kin. 9. 20. he draue as if he had been madde: he hath proiected a plotte to rise, he seekes his rising with im∣portunitie, with seruile flattery, with cleauing like a burre to some great mans coate, rather then he will returne voyde of a title? And indeed, it many times so falles out, that his wealth procures him honour, as well as his oppression, his vsury procured him wealth, this is also a solecisme and like false Latine, for honour and substance doe not agree together, except substance hath some other adiect vnto it, we set not so much by the vessell as by the liquor that is in it, not so much by the chest as by the treasure it conteineth, not so much by a man for his outward goods as inward goods, and therefore let wealth and worth goe together, let goods and goodnes kisse each other.
The last sort which would haue their share in this honour, and whose plea seemeth best for it, are they, which discend of more noble bloud then other, and can fetch their pedigree fur∣thest off, but euen these must know, that they are not to stand on the greatnes and antiquitie of their race, if they lacke ver∣tue, whereof greatnes tooke her beginning: Beatus Ludoni∣cus being asked, what honourable surname should be giuen vnto him, demanded againe, from whence it was, that he had greatest nobility, and when some sayd, of his Predeces∣sors, others of his birth place, I doe not remember, saith he, that euer I had greater honour, then when I became a Christi∣an, and this was at Pissiacum, and therefore will I be called Ludouicus de Pissiaco. and so he was, he thought no birth to a new birth in Christ, no parentage to that of hauing God to his father. Doe we reckon of the wine that runneth on the lees, because it was drawne out of the same peece, the neate wine was, doe we reckon of muddy water, though it came from a cleere spring, shall we, with the Israelites, bow to a molten calfe, because it was made of golden earings? It was the say∣ing of old English Chaucer, to doe the gentle deedes, that makes the gentleman: gentry without vertue is bloud indeede, but bloud without sewet, bloud without sinewes, bloud is but the bo∣dy of gentility, excellency, of vertue is the soule, that without this is a body without a soule, and without honour falles downe in the dust: and therefore, when Hermodius a noble man borne, imbraided the valiant Captaine Iphicrates, for that he was but a shoomakers sonne, my bloud, sayd Iphicrates, taketh beginning at me, and thy bloud at thee now taketh her farewell: be the birth neuer so base, yet honesty and vertue is free from disgrace, be the birth neuer so great, yet dishonesty and vice is subiect to dishonour. To conclude therefore if thou be noble by thy birth, proue not ignoble either by bad vices of thine owne, or lewde deuises of other, take thy great birth to be an obligation of great vertue, suite thy behauiour vnto it, and inoble thy parentage with pietie, and since true honour must come of thy selfe, and not of other, worke out thine owne glory, and stand not on what thou wouldest borrow of thy predecessors: If thou reach not the goodnes of those which gaue the outward glory, know it is
thy pride to be transported with a vaine name▪ if thou doest not as much honour thy house with the glory of thy vertues, as thy house hath honoured thee with the title of thy degree; know thou art but as a wodn knife put into an empty sheath, to help fill vp the place, when that if good mettle is lost, and can no more be found: if thou dost not learne Patrizare, and let thy fahers vertue meete with thy bloud, know thou art but as a painted fire which may become the wall, but giues no light to the beholder, nay know further that the greater the honour of thy father was, the greater is thy blemish and reproach, if thou come short of thy fathers vertue, for now art thou guilty of neglecting so good a President. They that are noble, will haue their retayners seeke the wor∣ship of their estates in the seruice of them, then let themselues seeke the honour of their estates in the seruice of God, and be as carefull to get true honour by seruing him, as their follow∣ers to receiue ciuill worship by seruing them. That thy dayes may be long: Gen. 32. 26. Iacob would not let the Angell goe before he blessed him: nor the Lord part with this com∣mandement, before it leaues a blessing behinde vpon them which doe obserue it; so that the entrance into this second table Ex 12. 7. like the doore posts of the Israelites hath a blessing vpon it: Eph. 6. 2. Saint Paul calleth this the first Command-ment with promise, not but that the second Commandement, hath a generall pro∣mise of mercy for the generall seruice of God: but this is the first, that hath a particular promise made vnto them, which performe the particular duties which it requireth: and second∣ly the first, not that a second followeth with any expresse pro∣mise, for first hath not alwaies relation to a second thing Rom . 8. as we may see in the Epistle to the Romaines, and theefore Heluidius argument, is false to proue the virgine Mar had a second sonne, because the Holy Ghost saith, Mat. 1. 25 she brought forth her first begotten sonne and called his name Iesus: and a Commande∣ment with promise, not that God doth binde himselfe that they which honour their parents shall alwaies liue long, for Gods promises of temporall blessings are Hypotheticae an goe with condition sometime expressed, sometime suppressed, which condition is as an oare in a boate, or sterne of a ship, and turnes the promise another way. The first thing therefore
which here I obserue is that long life is to be reckoned among the blessings of God: It was a blessing of God vpon Israel that being in the wildernes 40. yeares Deu. 29. 5 their garments did not weare Ios. 9. 5. as the garments of the Gibeonites, so if in many yeares some mens strength weares not, their senses doe not decay, their bodys, which are as the garments of their soules, hold out longer then other mens, as though with the Eagle they did renew their youth, and God did adde certaine yeares vnto their dayes. Esa. 37. 5. as he did vnto Ezechias, this is a great blessing of God. Men are full of holes and take water at a thousand breaches, some goe away by sikenes, some by violence, some by famine some by fulnes, sometime death Mat. 2. 16 is in the cradle, 2. Kin. 4. 40. sometime in the pot, sometime in the cup, therefore Iob doth not say the graue, but the graues were prepared for him, to shew that he was besiedged with many deaths, & that he had but one life among a number of deaths which were ready for him: now if death, which seeketh for vs euery houre & in euery place, be long be∣fore it finde vs, if hauing an habeas corpus, he will not serue his processe, till our yeares be as many ages, and we are satisfied with long life, if when our life hangeth in the ballance and there is but a step betweene vs and death, if we be continually as one trauelling with childe, if we walke thorough the valley of the shadow of death, and our soule be alwaies in our hand, yet we multiply our dayes as the sand, and euen like Sa∣lamanders liue long in the fire, this is a blessing of God. Some enter no sooner into life but they are at the brinke of death, receiuing at once their wel-come and their farewell, their lampe it wasted assoone as lighted, and their life at an ebbe before the tyde be full, others like flowers are gathered while they be fresh, and being like a sentence interrupted be∣fore a period, begin like some summer fruite to rotte assoone as they are ripe, death writes them Dan. 5. 3. as he did the Chaldean ty∣rant a letter of Summaunce to appeare that night before him: It is a curse of God vpon the bloud-thirsty and deceitfull man, Ps. 55. 23 he shall not liue out halfe his dayes, it was a punishment of God vp∣on Elie for cockering his sonnes and vpon his sonnes for their disobedience, 1. Sam. 2. 32. 33. the multitude of thine house shall dye when they be men, there shall not be an olde man in thine house for euer: it was
a plague of God vpon Israel that though they brought vp their children, Hos. 9. 12 yet God would depriue them from being men: a plague vpon the wicked, Iob. 36. 14. that their soule doth dye in youth, Iob. 22. 16 that they are cutte off before their time Gen. 38. 7. like Er and Onan as not worthy to liue vpon the earth; and on the other side it is Gods blessing, if he increase, the length of our dayes and yeares of our life, if we multiply our dayes as the sand, if death demande not his due, till the crowes feete be in our eyes, if we dye Iob. 42. 17. with Iob being olde and full of dayes, and goe to our graue in a full age, Iob. 5. 26. as a ricke of corne commeth in good season into the barne. This serueth first to confute that heathen who said, optimum est non nasci, proximum quam cito aboleri, the best thing is neuer to be borne, and the second best is to dye quickely, for though this life be ouer spread with sinnes and cares and crosses, which like a filthy morphew make it lothsome to all iudicious eyes, yet all these are but accidentall, life it selfe is a blessing, and the longer we liue, the more experience we haue of Gods fa∣uour, a greater loathing of the sinnes which our youth deligh∣ted in, and larger time of repentance. Againe this teacheth that we must not hasten forward the end of our dayes, and bring our selues out of breath before our race be ended, for this is to throttle and choake the blessing of God, let therefore the thred of thy life be drawne out by Lachesis till  be sent to cut it in sunder: let not the spirit resigne ouer it borrowed mansion, till naturall moisture of it selfe doth soake away, till like a Sise or wax candle it be con∣sumed to the socket, and the last drop of moisture quencheth the last sparke of glory, surrender not thy selfe when a conceit takes thee, let the landlord take it at his pleasure, doe not like a coward run away, but then depart in peace, when God saith, returne againe thou sonne of Adam, and then willingly pay tribute to Nature, when of themselues the naturall passages doe close together: like an empty bagge neither loue this life for delights in it, Ec. 1. 2. for vanitie of vanities and all is vanitie, yet loue it to serue God in it, neither hate this life for the miseries of it, yet hate it so far forth as it keepes thee in subiection to sinne. Againe come not presumptuously into places, where some
bodies are contagiously sicke, lest thou loose this blessing, and come vntimely to thy graue, come not within the lists of destruction, if Gen. 19. 20. with Lot thou canst haue a Zoar to saue thy selfe, fly as much from him, whose disease would infect thy bloud, as from him whose cruelty would spill it. Lastly bestow cost as long as thou maiest, to continue this blessing by vpholding this ruinous house of thine, it is against the course of Nature, and a way to tempt the very God of Na∣ture wilfully to hinder our health, or not seeke meanes to con∣tinue it, or to recouer it, God sendeth seuerall diseases, and hath appointed seueral Medicines as remeies to incounter thē, therefore honour the Phisition & Es. 38. 21 with Ezechias lay a plaister vpon the boyle: say not man hath his set period as well as the sea it boundes, which it cannot passe; say not, life and death is not in our owne handes, for some seeke death in misery, yet finde it not, others meete with it at feasts and gaudees, where they would fainest forget it, say not when the glasse is run doe what wee can, wee can stay no longer, and the clocke will stricke when the minites be past, say not, let death seke vs, yet it shall not finde vs till our time be come, and therefore a∣way with Phisicke, what shall meanes doe? for then a ope vpon thee, try euery knife, eate Colloquintida thy belly full, freqent places where the ayre about thee doth infect, and where the breath of one body is poyson to another, but in matter of hope, where the end is not knowne 2. Chr. 16 12. vse meanes with Asa, though thou rely not vpon them though many times they auaile not. Daies: though some mens liues be long, yet the Lord saith not, long yeares, long monethes, but long dayes, and Da∣uid measueth their length not by a goade or an ell, but by an hand, Ps. 39. 5. thou hast made my dayes as it were a span long, to shew how shorst this long life is, and howsoeuer we patch and peece these poore cottages of ours, yet they will come in manus domini and shortly fall into the Lords handes: Let old men in their arithmeticke, deduct their night (for sleepe which is like vnto death, being the customer of mans life, taxeth the nights to his owne vse) and they shall finde halfe their time stricken off at one blow. let them deduct their prime dayes, for Ec. 11. 10▪ childehood and youth are vanitie, another part is cut off, let them de∣duct
the dayes of sortow, which are rather to be tearmed death then life, and all their daies are gone, for life and misery are twines Hipocrates twines, borne together and dye together: The Lacedemonian in Plutarch hearing the Nighttingale sing sweetly▪ tooke her into his hand, and hauing stripped her of her feathers sayd tantum vox, she was nothing but voyce, such is the life of him that can sing the merriest note; if you strip it of sickenes, strip it of cares, strip it of sorrow: Gen. 5. 27. Mthusalh liued longest of all our forefathers, yet he liued not a thou∣sand yeares, but grant he had, yet a 2. Pet. 3. 8 thousand yeares to God are but as one day, but we, who commonly exceede not three∣score yeares and ten, liue not an houre to that day, and there∣fore Salomon as though our dayes were not worthy the title of time, mentioned not a time to liue, but Ec. 3. 2. a time to be borne, and a time to dye, as though death did bor∣der vpon life, as though our cradle did stand in our graue. Hee sayd something to the purpose, which sayd that life was smoake or the shadow of smoake, or the dreame of the shadow of smoake, but I say of him, as one sayd of ano∣ther, in another case, non dixit vt est, dixit vt potnit, hee made life as short as hee coul, no so short as hee should: hee shot nearer the marke who being demaned what life was, made an answere answereles, for he presently turned his backe and went his way, and indeede we fetch but here a turne, and God saith Ps. 90. 3. returne againe, our mortall life is but a liuing death, the ath receiues vs like a kinde mother into her entralls, when we haue a while troden her vnder foote, and all our time in respect of eternitie is shorter then the time betweene the drink∣ing of the emlocke and death of him that drinkes it, mine Ps. 39. 5. age is euen as nothing in comparison of thee (saith the Prophet) and euery man liuing is altogether vanitie. First therefore affect not a kinde of eternitie here vpon earth; old men as they are children for simplicitie, so would they be for yeares. Lysicrates in his old age dyed his white haires blacke, that he might see young still: The Num. 32. 5. children of Ruben and Gad, hauing much cattle, requested Moses leading the people toward the land of promise, that they might be left in the land of Gilead, and not goe ouer Iorden, so carnall men hauing many beastly affections, and worldly men whose
portion is in this life; say as Peter when Christ was transfigu∣red Mat. 17. 4 it is good to be here, and therefore with th Gadits, Num. 23. goe to building, and make their prison as strong as they can, but when they haue done what may be done, yet within a few daies, like the spider and her webbe, wherein shee thought to haue lodged as in her freehold, they shall bee swept away, their daies shall soone suffer eclipse, the night will come when their candle shall be put out, and they shall goe to their long home, though many times against their will, Gē 19. 26. as Lots wife went out of Sodome, as Luc. 16. 3. the vniust Steward went out of his office; though with the Crabbe they goe backward from death, and are pulled from life with more violence 1 K. 2. 28 then Ioab from the hornes of the Altar. Secondly, haue this life in contempt euen for this that it lasteth not; Mat. 20. 6 Here wee may not stand still, here wee can not rest, Re. 14. 13 that is reserued to another life, 1 Pet. 2. 11 here we are pilgrims and strangers, and therefore not in our Countrey to rest our selues, but in our iourney to walke our selues; if wee feele any pleasure, it is soone dashed with some mishappe, and like a calme continues not long without a storme, nay our sweet is tempered with sowre, and we finde a mixture of both; but say that our life were a Paradise, our ioyes exquisite, and our pleasures without composition, yet how can wee sing our songes in a strange land? how can this but coole our delight, and make vs lesse esteeme it, to consider our life is short, our delight vanish, and though we spend our time in pleasure, yet sodainly we goe downe to the graue. Thirdly, we haue here no abiding place, therefore seeke the place where we shall haue Heb 9. 15 a perpetuity, rather then this from whence wee must shortly goe of necessity, respect that where we shall haue an euerlasting habitation, rather then this, where like freshmen, we haue but as it were a yeere of pro∣bation. In purchasing you regard not so much three liues as the fee simple, not so much a lease determinable by yeeres, as land which goe to you and your heires for euer, then set not so much by this life, which shall vanish away like a scrolle, as by that where you shall receiue the charter of an euerlasting being, not so much by this day in which the sunne setteth, as by that day which knoweth no euentide, nor hath any sunne
going downe, where thou shalt haue no more Sunne to shinee Esa. 60. 19 20. by day, nor Moone by night, where the Lord shall bee thine euerlasting light, and thy God, thy glory. Thy daies. The day to come 1 Pet. 3. 10 is the day of the Lord, but the dayes present h are our dayes: A man reckones of thatg Ps. 90. 12 which is his owne, though it be but of small value, and hee of great ability, Naball a man of great possessions and excee∣ding mighty, yet reckones of his bread and other small com∣modities, 1 Sam. 25. 2. 11. Shall I take my bread, and my water, and my flesh, and giue vnto men whom I know not whence they bee? but if it bee dainty then wee set the more by it, as the poore man did by that 2 Sa. 12. 3. one little sheepe which he had bought in Nathans parable, but if further, we can neuer recouer it, if once it be gone from vs, then how great is our griefe to leaue it or loose it. Now time is ours, Luc. 19. 42. this day and nihil nostrum nisi tempus, nothing so pro∣perly ours as is time, it is also rare and dainty, for where∣as of other things a man may haue Iob i. 2. 3 many at one time, he can haue but one time at once, and if this be once past, behinde Ec. . 5. 6. 7. there is no holdfast to pull it backe againe: The Sunne and the wind and the riuers, all these three returne to their places: In the three parables, Luc. 15. 6 9. 31. the man doth finde his lost sheepe, the woman her lost groate, the father his lost sonne, but losse of time comes neuer againe, but is like a bird let flie at large out of the hand, or a word, which babled out cannot be recalled: If wee haue but a short time to enioy any thing, we take all the benefit we can reape in that time, as if a lease bee shortly out of date, we rip vp the grounds, eate vp the grasse, cut downe the copses, and take all the liberty the lease will af∣ford. Certaine hawkes in colder countries are most eager and earnest to take their prey, when the day light there is of least continuance, euen Re. 12. 1 the diuell him selfe is most busie, because he hath but a short time. Now time is ours, and it is but a short time we haue, he that is young may thinke he is old enough to die, he that is strucken in yeeres sees his set period before him, and may thinke himselfe too old to liue longer, the palme tree is full of blomes, the mappe of age is figured on his forehead, the calenders of death appeare in the fur∣rowes of his face, the graue doth call him saying, it is high time to depart this life, to come away and dwell in it, and
therefore take the benefit of this hot time, Ier. 4. 4. brake vp your fallow groundes, and sow not among the thornes be circum∣cisedb Deu. 0. 16. to the Lord, and take away the fore-skinnes of your hearts, let vnquit passions, and ambitious desires be crucifi∣ed Mat. 2 38 like the two theeues, and euen in this sense, let them Gal. 5. 12 be cut off that trouble you The wicked slippe no time to worke wic∣kdnesse, Io 2. 5 as wil le Asses in the wildernesse they goe forth to their businesse: it is now no good argument, they are not drunken,f Act 2. 15. since it is but the third houre of the day, for Esa. 5. 11. they rise vp early to fol∣lowa . 23. 2. drunkenesse: Balaam posteth for a bribe: Luc. 16. 5 the vniust steward hasteneth to make friends of the vnrighteous Mammon: be you as wise in your generatiō, Ex, 16. 21 gather Manna in the morning, steppe into the water Ioh 5. 7. with the criple, while health may bee recouered, open while Christ Reu. 3. 20 knocketh; Mat. 23. 37. gather your selues vnder the hen while shee clocketh; with Luc. 19. 5 Zache come quicke∣ly when Christ calleth, at this present instant change your hearts,  Cor. 6. 2 now is the accepted time, and now knoweth no morrow, Ioh. 9. 4. worke while it is day, euery day lay vp some∣what for the last, take order with death before it serues you with an execution, take hold on time as it commeth, and catch it by the forelockes: seeke Christ Mat. 28. 1 with Mary the first day of the weeke, and first houre of the day, chase not away good houres to bad purpose, sit not at the Alehouse and see the race of an houre glasse, vse not time with the slothfull, but gaine by the expense of time, when it steales from you, let it carry with it some witnesse of the passage in that you haue in it made your election sure, and would not hazarde the saluation of your soules, vpon the doubtfull euent of your finall repentance: they are your daies, say not we will doe with our owne what we list, but spend them and end them in God. In the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee: Long life is a blessing, which God giueth to obedient children, but hast thou but one blessing my father? Yes surely thou blessest when thou hast blessed, and therefore thou giuest Israel a fuitfull land also, the land of Canaan Ex. 3. 17. a land that floweth with milke and hon, so that thou hast Gen. 27. 3. blessed Iacob, and therfore hee shall bee blessed: Eph. 2. . thou art rich in mercy: mercy, there is the compassion of thy nature: rich, there is the abundance, Luc. 8. 1 thou giuest after thou hast giuen, as a spring runneth after it hath runne:
Ps. 100. 5 thy mercy is euerlasting, and thy goodnesse is without conclusion: Frst thou giuest breath that thy dayes may be long, then thou giuest bread in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee, here is a blessing vpon a blessing, as though one of thy mercyes did binde thee to giue another, as though former be∣nefits, were an earnest lay de to assure vs of those which are to come, as though thou wouldest shew what thou wilt doe by what thou hast done: The Oyle ceaseth not as long as there areb 2. Kin. 4. 6 vessels to receiue it, and thy mercy lasteth as long as there is a true concurrence, as long as there is no let in vs to hinder the apprehension: O Lord make our praise and thankes an∣swereable to thy goodnes, that as thy goodnes is without end, so there may be no period to our praise, but that we may still say, Ps 41. 13. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel world without end. So be it, euen so be it. Giueth: not that the Israelits should haue this land in present possession, for they did not enter vpon it till the daies of Ioshua, in whose time God cast out other nations and planted them in, but he speaketh in the present tense for the certaintie, of per∣formance: God forgiues vs our debts and when we sue out our pardon, Rom. 8. 33. hee acquits vs by proclamation, and crosseth our accompts here, that hereafter we may haue our Quietus est: and he is as true a debter to pay, as he is mercifull creditor to forgiue, and doth reckon that his promise doth as much indebt him to vs, as mens loue or desert doe indebt vs to them; first therefore O Israel here is a land made ouer vnto thee, and the grant is good, for that it cōmeth from the right Landlord, the Lord: and it is gratious for that it commeth not from a stranger but from thy God: the Lord is thy God, and therefore thou shalt haue it cum gratia et priuilegio, 1o. cum gratia thou shalt not pur∣chase it, or pay a fine or rent for it, but it shalbe passed ouer to thee by a deed of gift, thy God giueth. 2o. thou shalt haue it cum priuilegio, there shall be no ioint tenants or copartners to hold it with thee, but thou shalt haue it solely and wholy to thy selfe. The Lord, misdoubt not thy state: thy God looke to haue it with all fauour: giueth: doubt not of thy freedome: the: feare not any that now keepe the possession. The Lord thy God giueth: The diuels mouth doth run ouer, when shewing Christ all the Kingdomes of the world he saith,
Luc. 4. 6. All these are mine and to whom soeuer I will I giue the power and glory of them: if thou therefore wilt worship e, they shall be all thine: for, first for his claime he is like the franticke man, who standing on the sea shore, thought all the shippes that passed by to be his owne, or he doth but dreame he hath them, like him, who sleeping thought he held in his hands two staues, and waking did thinke verely they should be two crocier staues; and there∣fore presently prepared himselfe, tooke horse and posted for two Bishoprickes, not doubting but he should be presently in∣stalled, but his horse casting him, himselfe turned to be criple, and his crociers to be critches: God is the Lord of all by right, the diuell but by vsurpation: the Scripture stileth him f prince of darkenes, he shewes himselfe like the Poet Accius, who being but a dwarfe, made himselfe an image as if he had been one of the sonnes of Anac: indeede he may Iob. 1. 7. compasse the earth too and fro and walke in it, Ps. 24. 1. but the earth is the Lords and all that therein is, the compasse of the round world, and they that dwell there∣in. Secondly for his gift, howsoeuer like the Persians he may boast of golden mountaines, yet there neuer comes so much as a mouse forth, he is like that man, who bequeathed great Legacyes though himselfe were as poore as Iob, did inherit the winde and tasted the smart of bitter want: it is God, the fa∣ther, Sonne and Holy Ghost, who are the fountaine, the conduit and cisterne of all that we haue, and therefore Saint Paul saith, Rom. 11. 36. of him, thorough him and for him are all things. The Lord giueth: we hold that we haue in Capite: Gen. 41. 56. no corne in Egypt in time of famine but comes from Ioseph: Gen. 2. 8. Adam was brought into Pa∣radise not made in Paradise, and still man comes more nakede Iob 121. into the world, then Gen. 32. 10. Iacob did to Laban, when he brought but his staffe with him; and therefore we must not steale the bene∣fits we haue from the goodnes of God, to father them on for∣tune, on Nature, on our owne wit and industrey, vpon some sained God, as the heathen did vpon Mars, if in warre they had the vpper hand, vpon Minerua if they had wisedome, vp∣on Mercury, if their busines had speedy dispatch, for 1. Cor. 12 11. all these worketh on and the selfe same spirit, but we must giue God his due glory, in stripping our selues naked, and making an Inuen∣tory of all that we haue, we must make so many Items of receipt as they are blessings bestowed vpon vs.
Giueth: from aboue commeth all that we haue for the mat∣ter, and it commeth as a gift for the manner: Ps. 44. 3. The Israelites gat not the land in possession thorough their owne sword, neither was it their owne arme that helped them, but thy right hand, O God, and thine arme and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a fa∣uour vnto them. First therefore lift not vp thine horne on high, and speake not with a stiffe necke, be not the more puffed vp with pride, for that thou hast greater endowments and possessions then other, for 1. Cor. 4. 7. what hast thou that thou hast not receiued, if thou hast receiued it, why reioycest thou as though thou hadst not receiued it? it is a Na∣bals speach, my bread, my water, my flesh, for who hath ought that is not Gods, 1. Sam. 25 11. bonatua be donasua? We say indeede, our Mat. 6. 11 daily bread, but lest it should be thought to be pulled downe by weight of merit not powred downe by gift of grace we say, giue vs, and therefore Iob in the Catalogue of his vertues re∣hearseth this among the rest, he did Iob. 31: 25. not reioyce when his sub∣stance was great, nor beheld the Sun when it shined, or the Moone walking in her brightnes, he knew he was but a wea∣ther sheepe, vpon whom the shepheard had bestowed a Bell more then vpon the rest of the flocke, and therefore he would not cast his nose into the winde, and carry his crest the higher for any outward prosperitie that hee did enioy. Secondly that thou hast is giuen thee, therefore dispose of it to the good of thy neighbour, be like the Moone which let∣eth her light shine vnto the world, which is giuen by the ouer∣shining of the Sun vpon her. It is written of Alexander Bishop of Lincolne Quod nondum dederit, nondum secredit habere, He thought he had it not himselfe, if another were not the better for it, neither thinke that thine owne state wilbe em∣payred by relieuing other, for it is written, 2. Cor. 9. 9 he hath sparsed a, broad & giuen to the poore:   remaineth for euer, that is, he shall haue to giue of continuance, the flowers hurt not their owne fruit, though they yeeld hony to the painfull Bee; The Sun looseth not it light, though it lendeth light vnto the Moone, nor he in conclusion hurts his estate, whose hand is not to close for others neede, nor to open for his owne, Lu. 6. 38 giue there is a precept, and it shall be giuen you, there it is backt with a promise
or giue, there we are bound, and it shall be giuen you, there is a counter-band to saue vs harmeles: God giues vs a bill of his hand, or enters into band, and becomes surety that we shall be payd with aduantage. Thirdly that which thou hast is giuen, therefore giue thankes, if God withdraw the light of his countenance it is for our try∣all, if hee letteth it to shine vpon vs it is to cause a re∣flection of thankes: A dutifull tenant that thinkes to hold his liuing or buy a further estate, will pay his rent, and sometime bring his Lord a present; we are tenants to God, and if wee will hold that we haue, we must doe him seruice and homage, we must pay him yearely our hourely rent, gratiarum actio est initatio ad plus dandum, this praise may cause him to open his hand, and fill vs with blessings▪ be therefore like the solide bo∣dy which hath a reflexe of heate, where the Sun doth extend the beames of light, and though we haue euen yron hearts, yet let his graces like an Adamant draw them vnto him, draw duti from vs. Lastly that which thou hast is giuen, therefore be patient, if God impouerish thee when thou art rich, abate thee if thou hast much, and pull thee downe if thou art aloft. Iob. 1. 21. Iob imputed no vnreasonable dealing vnto God, though he bereaued him in a minute of all that he had in his life, but is content that God should dispose of that which he had put into his hands: we hould that we haue of God not in feesimple, that he should pretend no more title to them, for though he puts vs in possession, he puts not himselfe out of possession, he is Lord royall still & true owner of all, he is the maker of all, this word maker impor∣teth, he hath made all things in such sort, that it is meete all power and soueraigne Dominion should remaine to himselfe, we are tenants advolntate dmini, Copy holders at the will of the Lord, grudge we not therefore if God visit our estates, but goe lightly away with an easie burden. The land which the Lord thy God giueth thee: When Abrahab Gen. 12. the father of the faithfull, first set foote in the land of Canaan, he had not in it the breadth of a foote, but within a while, such was his humble and gentle carriage, he got the fauour of the Hittites, Gen. 23. 6. 0. bought a field and possession of Ephron, and all the people confirmed the sale: after that not a field, but a whole
countrey not by purchase but by gift Ios. 14. & 15. was allotted to the sons of Abraha, and distributed among the Tribes: Ps. 115. 16 the earth God hath giuen to the children of men, Ps. 105. 1 but this pleasant and plentifull part of the earth did he giue vnto Israel, as a particu∣lar inclosure out of the commons of the whole world, and therefore it is compared Esa. 20. 6 to an Ile, because Israel was separa∣ted from other countries, as an Ile from other lands: & as Gen. 43. 34. Ben∣iamin had his mease by himselfe, so (according Num. 23. 9. to Balaams pro∣phecy) the people did dwell by themselues, & were not recko∣ned among the nations: Ierusalem was walled about, and Ioh▪ 4. 9. the Iewes did not meddle with the Samaritans: but after (according to the Zac. 2. 4. prophecy of Zachary) Eph. 2. 14 the partition wall was broken downe, and the Church of Christ dispersed farre and nigh, Gal. 6. 16 is called, the Israel of God, which shall enter into his rest, and Mat. 8. 11 sit downe with Abraham Isaac and Iacob, in the Kingdome of heauen: where∣of this land of Canaan was a type and figure, whether hee bring vs that made vs, for his Sonne Iesus Christ his sake, to whom with the Father and the holy Ghost, be giuen all honour and glory for euer. The sixt Commandement. Exod. 20. 13. Thou shalt not kill. IT is true, which the father of lyes saith in the booke of Iob, Iob 2. 4. Skin for skin, and all that euer a man hath will he gen for his lfe. Mens mindes are shut in their chests, as dead bodies are buried in coffins, they are interred in the Glgatha of this world, as moles are intombed in their hils; yet set a man neuer so much by his wealth, he will giue his goods for the ransome of his life▪ more then so, men pre∣ferre their liberty before their riches, for say fetters bee of gold, yet is the seruitude no lesse miserable, though it be more glorious, but to saue their liues the Ios. 9. 23. Gbonites are content to loose their liberty, and neuer to bee freed from being bond∣men. Since therefore life is so precious, God in this comman∣dement takes order for the life of man; first forbidding all
cruelty, which might take it away, then inioyning vs to vse the best meanes we may to preserue it. The negligent Pastor, the seditious Hereticke, which slay the soues of men, and so destroy the life spirituall, the detra∣cting , whose tongue as sharpe as the quilles of a Porcupin, wounde the good name of his neighbour, and so destroy the life ciuill; with bare mentioning I pass ouer, sup∣posing that other commandements leade me a nearer way in∣to these fieldes, only the malicious murderer, who laies waite for bloud, and so destroies the life naturall, shall be the subiect of my speach, for the hand of this text doth leade me to him, and therefore God assisting me, I will spend this daies exercise in this walke. There are some sinnes as more hainous then other, which are said to cry vnto God for vengeance, as the sinne of the So∣domites Gē 8. 20. mentioned in the Epistle to the Rō. 1. 24. Roaines: the sinne of oppressors, Ia. 5. 4▪ which keepe backe the hire of the labourers: the sinne of murther, for G 4. 10. the voice of bloud doth cry vnto God: the wounds opening and bleeding in the presence of the murderer doe after a sort cry and say, Lord how long? how long wilt thou cease to be auenged? euen Iob 24. 12 the soule of the slaine doth cry out, and therefore when the seruants were slaine, which were messengers sent to inuite the guests vnto the wed∣ding, God is not said to see it, as he doth this and other sinnes, but Mat. 22. 7 when the King heard it, hee was wroth: Gē. 4. 11. The earth opens her mouth to receiue the bloud of the slaine, Esa. 26. 2 but the earth shall dislose her blod, and shall no more hide her slaine, the bloud which shee hath drunke, shee shall againe cast out, that it may cry against those, which spared not to dislodge the soules of innocents form their harmeles bodies. A man cannot water the earth with his brothers bloud, but he wrongeth God, for Gen. 9▪ 6 in the image of God did e make man: he therefore that batheth his sword in the pretious life of man, razeth Csrs picture, and breakes in peeces the Kings broade Seale. The G 3. 17 earth was cursed for sinne, but Gen. 4. 12 the first murderer did loose of that blessing which remained vnto it. Gen. 4 15 God would not haue Kain slain, not that he fauoured the murder, but to shew how he detested the shedding of bloud,
when he would not haue a hand stretched out against him, who had committed such outrage against▪ the person of his owne brother. The Lord did forbid the eating of bloud, Leu. 17. 13. euen the bloud of the least bird, the eating of flesh Gen. 9 4. which died of it selfe, or which was strangled, because the bloud was in it. Leu. 23. 28. Hee would not haue the damme and young killed both in one day: and though Deu. 14. 21. strangers had a larger Patent for eating of flesh then the people of God, yet the flesh of an Oxe that had go∣red any man or woman to death might not be eaten, noe not of strangers. All these prohibitions tended to this end to teach, that we must not lay waite for blould, that we must not deuoure mens soules like Lyons, and teare them in peeces, that we must not bee like wolues in the euening; eating vp our brethren, as if we would eate bread, nor swallow them vp quicke, like a graue, euen whole as those that goe down into the pitte. Againe the Num. 19. 11. the Lord did command, that hee which had touched the dead body of any man, as being vncleane should purifie himselfe: the like should he doe Num▪ 31. 19. which had killed any person, euen him or her whom to saue aliue had beene sinne: Gen 9 7 he commandeth the preseruation of seede, Deu. 20. 10. and comman∣deth euen in warre to be mindfull of pitty; all these Iniun∣ctions tended to this end, to teach vs the more to detest the shedding of bloud, and to shew that violence which is hurtfull in all things is horrible in life. God in all ages seuerely punished this finne, to shew hee would haue no man breake the prison, and let the soule out, but he that did inclose it: before the law was giuen vnto Mo∣ses, God enacted this statute, Gen. 9 6 who so sheddeth mans bloud, by man shall his bloud be shed. The Ex. 21. 12 Law was life for life: a law neuer repealed, for it standeth in effect in the last booke of the Bible; Ap. 13. 10 if any kill with a sword, hee must bee killed by a sword: If a man did smite his ser∣uant that he died vnder his hand, though among the Romanes such a master went free, because he bought his seruant with his money, yet because the life is more worth then money, God will not free him, Ex. 21. 20▪ puniendo punietur, hee shall be surely pu∣nished.
If men did striue and hurt a woman with childe, though there were no intent to kill, either the mother or the child, Ex. 21. 22. yet if death followed, life should be paid for life. A man would thinke, it had been no great matter, if he had killed a theefe, that should come and vndermine his house, or breake it vppe, but yet if this were done in the day time, by the iudiciall law of Moses, Ex. 22. 2. hee that did it must dye for it. Deu. 21. 1 If one were found slaine in the field, and he not knowne that committed the murther, the next City should beare the blame, should offer sacrifice, protest before God that they were cleere of that fact, desire God to be mercifull to them, and not lay innocent bloud vnto their charge. If a man did not lay waite for bloud, but had Ex. 21. 14. killed any vnawares, he might take Sanctuary, and flie to the Altar, but if he had killed any wilfully, the holynes of the place should not defend him, and therefore Salomon biddeth Benaiah to smite Iab, because he smote two men more righteous and bet∣ter then he, and slew them with the sword, though 1 Kin. 2. 28 Ioab had caught hold on the hornes of the Altar. God would take vengeance on Gen. 9. 5. beasts generally, for the life of man, particularly Ex. 21. 28 the goaring Oxe that killed any should be stoned to death, to shew that beastly minded man should not goe vnpunished, who sheds his brothers bloud like water, who oppresseth him round about for his soule, and causeth his head to goe downe to the graue with bloud. The lawes of other Nations, as well as Gods lawe to the Iewes, doe meete with this sinne, and cutting them off from other men, rewards them to their face, to bring them to destru∣ction, which lift vp their hands against other to destroy them: To let passe forraigne Countries, in our land if a man did run into a premunire, he should be put out of the Kings protecti∣on, his lands, goods, and cattles forfaited to the King, but yet there was a law made Eliz 1o. against such as should slea euen such a man, as was attainted in premunire. King Richard the first, making orders for sea-faring men ordained, that if one slew an other on the shippe-boarde, he should be bound to the dead body, and throwne into the sea, if on the land, he
should be bound to him, and buried with him quicke. The land is clensed of the bloud that is shed in it, by the bloud of him that shed it, and therefore the statute law takes away all mur∣derers like drosse walking more stubbornly, and taking grea∣ter vengeance on those, which shall imbrue their hands in the bloud of them, to whom by nature or duty they are most bound; by nature, as if a woman since her husband and shee are one flesh, shall kill her husband, shee shall be accounted a paricide by the Ciuill law, and by the Statute of the land a trai∣tor, and be punished accordingly: by duty, as if a seruant kill his master, it is petie treason, if one kill any Iudge sitting in his place, it is high treason; and such a man shall drinke more depely of the cuppe of vengeance, but let one say a man bee he neuer so meane feloniously, his least punishment is suspen∣sion, his death-bed is the gallowes, say he doth escape, and be not taken, then the Towne where the murder is commit∣ted, shalbe amerced: say, the matter be compounded, yet God himselfe will take the matter into his owne hand, his ven∣geance by iustice shall waite his destruction that doth commit it, he will euen set his face against the person, and will cut him off from among his people, for sometime he stirreth vp Gen 6. 9. some other man, to shed the bloud of him, thar sheddeth bloud, and therefore Gē. 4. 14 Cain is afraid, that euery man that findeth him, will slay him. That valiant Hercules did cast Dimedes King of Thrace, who fedde his horse with mens flesh, to horses to bee deuoured: Perillus was inforced to make tryall, how his bra∣sen Bull would roare, and when the Tyrant Phalaris had bur∣ned many in it, his owne Citizens falling vpon him, put him into the same Bull, and made him end his life with like kinde of death. It is remarkable how the Duke of Burgundy, dealt with a murderer, A cruell minded man had taken a noble man pri∣soner, his wife whose heart did cleaue vnto her husband, was an earnest suiter for his life, that no hand might be vpon him; to put him to death, the cut-throate answered; if he might goe vp to her bed, imbrace her bosome, take his fill of loue and his pleasure in dalliance, he would set her husband at liber∣ty, shee thought it were as death to her, to breake her faith plighted in marriage, yet so great was her loue, that shee did
deliberate, and first craued leaue to confer with her husband, who, though this thing were grieuous vnto him, because of his wife, yet gaue her leaue, that he might haue his deliuerance, the deed done, and this varlet hauing lyen with her fleshly, and vsed her at his pleasure, he notwithstanding the next day chopt off her husbands head, and sent it vnto her, whereupon shee complained to the Duke, who sent for him, compelled him to marry her, that so she might challenge a right in his possessions, and then causing him to drinke of the same cup, cut off his head. It is true that the Psalmist saith, Ps. 5 5. 23 the bloud∣thirsty man shall not liue out halfe his daies, one dies fettered in prison, another scalded in the brothel house, many in warre, when the land of the enemies doth eate them, & licke them vp as an Oxe lieketh vp grasse of the field, when their enemies chase them, as Bees vse to doe, so that they cannot stand in the day of battaile, but their carcasses fall to the earth and can∣not escape: thus the roaring of the Lyon, the voyce of the Lyo∣nesse, and the teeth of the Lyons whelpes are broken. This made Rebecah, speaking of Esau and Iacob, to say, Gen. 27. 45. Why should I be depriued of you both in one day? not thinking that Iacob being of a gentle disposition would rise vp against his brother Esau, and so they kill one another, but her meaning was, that if Iacob did not auoid the countrey, Esau conside∣ring that Iacob had the birthright and the blessing, would kill him: then some iudgement of God would light vpon Esau for his vnnaturall fact, to roote him out of the lande of the liuing: Mercifull men are taken away many times, because Heb. 11. 38. the worldc Esa. 57. 1. is not worthy of them, but cruell and bloud-thirsty men, be∣cause they are vnworthy to liue in the world. But say their daies are prolonged, and like Serpents and Salamanders they liue long, yet are they killed with a sword of their owne, as 1. Sam. 17. 51. Goliah was: the remembrance of their cruell fact wounds them at the very heart, and strikes them in a maruailous feare of Gods great vengeance to be powred vpon them: and where∣as good men dwell safely, be quiet from feare of euill, and haue their delight in the multitude of peace, God sends his plagues vpon murderous mens hearts, their sinne lieth at the doore, they know their iniquity, and their sinne is euer before them, their hearts know the bitternes of their soules, euen in laugh∣ing
their hearts are sorrowfull, their sinne doth testifie to their faces, their inuentions beset them about, their casting downe is in the midst of them, affliction and anguish doe make them afraid, and preuaile against them, as a King ready to battaile: euen the wickedest men, and they which seeme to be tou∣ched with nothing, hauing once slaine them whom they hated most of all other, doe presently after the deed done feele heart∣bitings which sting them inspight of their teeth, and hold them as it were vpon the racke, by making them feele, that God sets himselfe against them as an enemy. When Mariamne Herods wife, was vniustly made away by her husband, shee seemed euery night to trouble him, and wake him out of sleepe, pinching and tormenting him in such a wrekefull sort, as he could not take his rest or ease at any time. Theoricus vniustly slew Symmachus a noble man, but be∣ing at supper, he saw (as he imagined) the visage of Symma∣chus in a fishes head, whereupon such a trembling did come vpon him, and such a feare did take hold on his flesh, that his strength being dried vp like a pot sheard, his tongue cleauing to his iawes, his heart powred out, his soule cast downe, his eies kept waking, his bones cut in sunder, he neuer after en∣ioyed good houre: thus doth Gods iustice follow these mer∣ciles men at the hard heeles, they feele their sinne stirring in them, as it were some liuing thing crawling in their bodies, and gnawing vpon their hearts, which make them cry out of the foulenes of their sinne, and carry torments and vexati∣ons against themselues, vntill their dying day. As therefore the Pythagorians went too much on the one hand, exceeding into too much pitty, when they thought no liuing creature might be eaten, and the Manichees, who go∣ing further then thus, would eate no egges, imagining that when they be broken, their life or soule passeth from them, and more then so, would not allow the cutting of hearbes or trees, or plucking ought from them, for that hauing life and feeling, as they thought, they did by this meanes suffer griefe paine and smart: so they goe too much on the other hand, which will not suffer the twist of mans life to twine out, but cut it off before the clue be ended, herein the chiefe offenders (because
euery man is neerest to himselfe) are they, which but cher them∣selues, who will not abide in the station, in which God hath placed them, till he call them backe againe, but send the soule from the sentinell, wherein shee is placed in this body, without the leaue of her Captaine, whose calamities cause them to leaue life, and cowardly run away, who suffer shipwracke by taking a shorter cut to their iourneys end: these are worse then beasts, who sometimes goare one another, but neuer rage against themselues; such a one was Iudas, who, when the betraying of the innocent bloud lay heauy vpon his heart, chose rather to aduenture vpon the future paines hee feared, then indure the present horrour hee felt, Mat. 27. 5 and therefore like a fish he leapt out of the pan into the flame. The funerall of the couetous man is many times wilfull, for in the extremi∣ty of his couetous folly, hee dispatcheth himselfe when corne is cheape, hee hangs vp himselfe for the fall of the market. Lawes haue prouided death for Theeues, for Trai∣tors, and other notable malefactors, but sometime they can finde little opportunity of execution, for these lewde persons preuent the time, sometime by peece, sometime by poyson, sometime by dagge, sometime by dagger: some∣time they make a cutlers shoppe of their owne bellyes, some∣time they choake themselues with a little neck-weede, one way or other, they desperately sunder their soules from their bodyes, and conclude their owne shamefull confu∣sion. There are other, who though they are not guilty of their owne death, by laying violent hands vpon themselues, yet by other vnlawfull meanes they cast themselues out of the world, and hasten forward their owne daies. The glutton digs his owne graue with his teeth, for life is a lampe, excesse in meate doth shorten the one, as too much oyle doth extinguish the other: Intemperate gulliguts turning that into occasion of death, which was giuen for preseruation of life, neuer liue long, neuer liue well, plures periere crapula quam gladi: Cooks haue prouided as bad weapons as Cutlers, for all turns to bad humour, that transcends the due proportion of nourish∣ment. Epicures are as desperate as souldiers, and meate kils
as many as the musket, the glutton therefore as he is hatefull to God, loathsome to man, so is hee hurtfull to himselfe in hastening his owne death. Againe the drunkard layes himselfe in his graue before he be dead, and is as stinking carrion more then halfe rotten aboue the ground: The cup killes as many as the Canon, and there∣fore challenging professors drinke themselues out of health, while they drinke to the health of their friends. Vna salus sanis nullam potare salutem: Non est in pota vera salute salu. Vnlawfull desires doe wast the strength of adulterers, as the flame consumeth the tallow: they themselues, like candle∣flies, venture so neare the fire that they burne themselues, their harlots like horse leaches sucke out their best bloud, euen their heart bloud: howsoeuer their sinne delighteth, yet nothing sooner at an end in it selfe, nothing sooner maketh an end of them, and sticking by them when all their friends forsake them, causeth a short life and most shamefull death. Lastly the enuious man doth murder himselfe, for being as sory for another mans prosperitie, as his owne aduersitie, he lets goe the bridle to his cursed affection, which like a fretting canker doth Pro. 14. 30. eate vp his body, dry vp his bloud, and rotteth his bones: This man is not like the maide whom Auicen speaketh of, who feeding and nourshiing her selfe with poy∣son, was her selfe healthy, yet infected other with her vene∣mous breath, but like the serpent Porhpyrius, which is full of poyson, but wanting teeth hurts none but himselfe, like the lit∣tle flyes, who while they would put out the candle, burne themselues, they burne themselues with the fire of their owne heart as Aetna consumed it selfe, and Leu. 10. 1 as Nadab and Abih were consumed with the fire of their owne censors: Malitia procedit ex te (saith Saint Augustine) et quem prius vastat nisi te? quo profundit ramum ledit, vbi radicem habet non ledit? Equidem dico, quod malitia tua, vt alteri non noceat, fieri potest, vt autem tibi non noceat, fieri non potest: the effect is this, malice drinketh the most part of it own venome: The snake in the Apologue licked off her owne tongue, when thinking nothing should haue teeth but her selfe, she would haue licked the file plaine which shee found with teeth at the smiths forge: Act. 2. 38 The viper, which
leapt vpon Pauls hand with an intent to hurt him, fell her selfe into the fire and perished: Saint Paul therefore bringing in these sinnes by the brace, Rom. 13. 12. 13. gluttony and drunkennes, Chambering and wantonnes, strife and enuying wisheth vs to cast them all away calling them workes of darkenes, both because they proceede from the Prince of darkenes, and also leade the way to vtter darkenes, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth. Others though they seeke not their own death or wilfully hinder their owne health, yet other mens bloud they shed like water, and will not spare their soules from death bur take them away: either secretly: thus did Dauid make the sword ap∣proach to Vriah, 2. Sam. 11 15. in causing him to be set in the forefront of the battaile, that he might abide the first incounter and violence of the enemie, that the enemie might persecute his soule and take it, and treade his life downe vpon the earth: thus did 1. Kin. 21. 10. 11. Iezabell compasse Naboth round about to take away his soule, for thorough her meanes the men of the Citie laide to his charge things that he knew not, and suborned witnesses, brought him within compasse of treason: some openly water the earth with bloud, and their hands are vpon their brethren to put them to death, and as among ciuill men, it is but a word and a writ, so among swaggering cauilleirs, it is but a word and a wound. A sinne so much against nature, that I would forbeare further speach of it, were it not that their are some which stand for the bloudy vse of single combats, either to determine a publicke warre, or to make triall of a priuate right: First say they, warre is vtrim{que} triste, euen victory many times is like a golden fish∣hooke, which lost or broken cannot be paide for with that it taketh, therefore 2. Kin. 14. 8 Amaziah King of Iudah sends to Iehoash King of Israel, saying, come let vs see one another in the face: as if he should say let common bloudshed be preuented, let one sword not many try the matter, why should we destroy one anothers Citties, let thou and I (1. Sam. 17 41. like Dauid and Goliah) fight hand to hand, better one man perish then many people suffer, but Iehoash returned him a scornefull answere, comparing him∣selfe to a Cedar in Lebanon, and Amaziah to a thistle, which the wilde beasts in Lebanon trodde vnder foote: and in very deede why should one Champions necke and shoulders beare all the heads of a common wealth? say he doth vanquish, yet what
boldnes is it to hazard her? say he be vanquished, what bolde wrong doth hee to lose her? neuer therefore cast vpon two hands the tryall of a iust warre, which doth concerne a whole State. Againe what is the valour of the man to the right of his cause, whether it be to title of inheritance, when the matter is doubtfull and demurred, or the righting of his name, when it is traduced, indeede the positiue lawes of diuers nations al∣lowed this kinde of triall, when the truth was not knowne: but is therefore the title good, because the man is more valiant and skilfull? When Robert Bishop of Sarisbury in the reigne of Ed∣ward the 3. sued William de Montacute, Earle of Sarisbury for the Castle of old Sarum, or as some say, Sherburne, the Earle answered, that he would defend his right by a Combat, where∣vpon at a day appointed the Bishop brought forth his Champi∣on to the barres, cloathed in a white garment, downe to the midst of the legge, and vpon it he had a souldiers cloake, in which were drawne out the Bishops armes, him followed a souldier bearing a staffe, and a youth with a Tergat, forth∣with the Earle brought his Champion forth by rhe hand, clad in like manner, him followed two souldiers bearing white staus, when now these 2. Champions were ready to enter the listes, they were bid to stand backe and stay till men did measure their weapons, while this was in doing suddenly came the Kings letters commanding them to differ the matter till ano∣ther time, while this pause was made, the matter was com∣pounded and the Earle contented vpon the receipt of 2500 markes, to depart with his right in the Castle to the Bishop and his successors for euer, but say the combat had been fought, might not he, who had had the right been kept short at the staues end, and might not the hand of him that had offered wrong haue been in the necke of his aduersary: Neither was Richard the vsurper a more lawfull King, because his Champi∣on after his challenge triumphed with his cup of gold. Againe another saith I am falsely accused, and now by a Duell I will proue my selfe innocent: In the 6. yeare of Richard the 2. Sir Iohn Ausly Knight defendant held a battaile with one Garcon Appellant, wherein the Knight hauing the vpper hand forced his enemy to yeeld vnto him: whereupon Garco
was presently drawne to the place of execution, and there hanged for his false accusation: but is this a good consequent: the Knight did smite his enemy, get the mastery, had his lust sa∣tisfied vpon his accuser, therefore he was wronged, and cleare of the fact whereof hee was accused. On the other side, in the 24. yeare of Henry the 6. an Armourers Seruant of Lon∣don appeached his Master of treason, who offered to be tryed by battaile: Smithfield was the place appointed for the fight, in which the Seruant did ouercome the Master, whereupon as sufficiently proued guilty, his body was drawne to Tyburne and there hanged and beheaded: might not here the Seruant though he were guilty insult in the conquest, and the Master, though he were guiltles lye bleeding in the combat, especially since his friends (as the Cronicle reporteth) brought him so much Malmesey and Aqua-vitae before the fight to comfort him, that both wit and strength were taken from him. Stultus ab euentu, facta notanda putat. This kinde of triall is like the searching out of the truth by lots, lots might and may be vsed for diuiding seuerall mens right, so Ishua, diuided the land of Canaan among the Tribes Ios. 14. 2 by lott; or for appointing officers, as they Act. 1. 26. chose an A∣postle by lot to succeede in Iudas place, but to vse them to the finding out of any secret thing, except it be by the commande∣ment of God, who this way would Ios. 7. 18. haue Achas theft found out, is but meere foolery, and a great tempting of God. For though God Ion. 1. 7. in the prophesie of Ionah did order the lots, which the Mariners cast, in such sort that they found out the party, for whose cause euill was vpon them, which was done both that Ionas might be brought forth who fled from the pre∣sence of God, and that the Mariners moued by this example might giue off their superstition, yet what certaintie is there in lots & what building vpon them, when we see that Est. 3. 7. Haman (who cast a lot from day to day, from moneth to moneth be∣ginning at the first vnto the last to finde out which might be the luckyest dayes to roote out the Iewes) found them to be most Est. 9. 1. &c. dolefull dayes to him and his, which by lot were perswaded to be most fortunate: & on the contrary side, the same dayes so ioy∣full to the Iewes, that they might say, these are the dayes which the Lord hath made, we will rioyce and be glad in them, and
therefore they kept the very same daies festiuall, they and their seed through many generations: and indeed a man can no sooner finde out any thing vnknowne by lot, by combat, then he can Iudge of soundes by taste, and therefore those Countryes, which in the times of vnciuill ignorance tollera∣ted a tryall by battaile, doe now dislike it, and therefore haue repealed those lawes which did allow it, euen at this day the barbarous Turkes burne single combattants in the side with hotte coales of fire: I will not here spend time to answere those, which thinke it a staine to their credit, and a disgrace to their name, if they shall not answere those, which haue sent them the length of their swords, and from whom they haue receiued proude challenges: onely this I say, men of great va∣lure haue reiected challenges, which haue proceeded from them, who haue had more heart then braine, more head then wit, without any blemish to their reputation: but say that some will count thee a coward, yet non quid alij, sed quid tu de te: feare not so much shame as sinne, loue good name, but yet as an hand-maide of vertue, woe and court common fame no further then it followeth vpon honest courses, and thinke thy selfe but base, if thou shouldest depend on vulgar breath: ne∣uer hazarde thy life for thy name, neuer kill an other man to be accounted a gallant man of thy hands; this name shall not so much delight thee, as thy conscience shall gall thee, memo∣ry afflict thee, repentance vexe thee, perplexity torment thee, when the deed done thou shalt see thy selfe cited before Gods iudgement seate euery houre, when thy heart knowing the bitternesse of thy soule shall tell thee, that thou hast neglected thy soule, endangered thy body, hurt thy children, brought a blemish to thy posterity, which in the next generation shall not be put out. Indeed we read of spirituall Duels, for in the Mat. 4. 3. Scriptures we haue the Prince of peace, and Prince of this world comba∣tinga 1 Sam. 1 41. together, the Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah is encountred (as Dauid with the Giant) by the roaring Lyon that seeketh to deuoure vs. Againe wee haue the Mat. 15. 22. Cananitish woman wrastling with Christ, as Gen. 32. 24. Iacob with the Angell, and fastening vpon him with her prayers, as the Shunamite vpon Elisha with herd 2 Kin. 4. 27
hands. In the first Christ did vanquish, and make the diuell auoide by casting in his face scriptum est. In the second he is ouercome, for with excellent wrestlings, the Cananite wre∣sled with Christ, and got the vpperhand: euery good Chri∣stian must fight those fights; and therefore for the first, the Church of God is called Militant: In Baptisme we receiue our prest money, and in the Eph. 6. 11 Ephesians there is a proclamation ad arma: neither doth a crowne remaine to any at the last, but to such as first can say with Paul, 2 Tim. 4. 7 I haue fought a good fight, he is lured to the crowne, that is allured to the combat: and there∣fore the holy Ghost setting out the compleat armour of a Chri∣stian, doth not mention a backe Curete, c to shew he should ne∣uer flye and turne his backe vpon his enemy, but be like An∣droclid, whom, when a souldier did deride him, because be∣ing lame, he went vnto the warre, answered merrily, he came to fight, and not to run away. For the second we must wrastle and combat with God by our prayers, and not leaue till we ouercome him, who is in∣uincible: if we want any thing, leaue him not, our importun∣ty cannot be too great, our impatience cannot offend his pa∣tience, beate vpon him still like the Mat. 15. 23. 24. Cananite, who stands to it though she had many repulses, though Christ first neglects her, then denies her, then reprocheth her: be like the a widdow, Luc. 18. 5 who will not leaue the vniust Iudge, though at first he lend her but a dease eare: be like the blindman, who made the Sunne of righteousnes, (Ios. 10. 13 which stayed that Sun in the dayes of Ioshua which reioyceth as a Gyant to run his course) Lu. 18. 40 to stand still, till his sight was restored: If we indure punishment his anger is a speare, leaue him not, till our prayers breake it in peeces, his iudgement is a sword, leaue him not till wee make him put vp his sword into his sheath: praiers haue power with God, and are of such force, that when he intends to pu∣nish a nation, Ier. 11. 14 he forbids his Prophets to pray, lest he should alter his minde and so be ouercome: these are the combats commanded, commended by God: as for other duels vnder what habit soeuer they may be shrouded, and what glasse soeuer may be set vpon them, if their vizors be taken off: they will appeare to be flat against this statute, not that a man in defence of himselfe, when he can giue no further ground, may
with an vnwilling willingnes smite with the sword, for now necessity doth bind him to strike, and he seeks not so much an others death, as the safegarde of his owne life. Neither doth this Commandement shorten the Magi∣strates arme, for Rom. 13. 4 he beares not the sword inuaine, and when Ioh. 18. 11 priuate men must put vp their swords into their sheathes, he must vn sheath his sword, as the dreadfull instrument of di∣uine reuenge, and hating mercifull iniustice must throw pitty ouer barre, in this respect more willing to be reputed a busie Iustice then quiet Gentleman: to restraine Iustice is to support sine, and not to correct is to consent to the crime: nay he he is so farre from breaking this Commandement by drawing out his sword, that he is guilty of the breach of it, if hee draw it not, neither is it so great a fault to kill a Lambe out of the flocke, as to let a wolfe goe free, Qui parcit Lupo macta gregm, hee that forgiues the bad, doth wrong the good. Hemingius maketh mention of a fellon, who was indited of seuen murders▪ while the Iudge was studying what grie∣uous punishment should be inflicted vpon such a bloudy vil∣aine; an Aduocate steps to the barre, and pleading for him, proued that the Iudge was guilty of six of the murders, for that the fellon was not put to death for his first offence: there∣fore let not Iudges, which are appointed of God to prosecute the wicked with the sword, drawne for fauour keepe it cleane from bloud, let it neither surfet of bloud through cruelty, nor yet rust for want of vse through partiality; let them bee as ready to execute a rebell, as defend an innocent, let them cut off those limmes, which lacke bloud and life, and hurt other parts of the body, let them roote out the wicked, lest the haruest of weedy nature be ouer plenteous, when they sit at the bench: let euery one of them lay aside the personage of a friend, if their nearest kinred, their greatest acquaintance come vnder tryall, let them say, I know you not, especially let them not pardon such as offend often, lest they fall to fur∣ther boldnesse, and sinnes vnpunished become exemplary. Neither is this Commandement a Barre to lawfull warre, for when men are ripe or rather rotten in sinne, so that the stinch of their iniquity ascendeth vp vnto heauen: God sen∣deth many times a forraigne power as a vultur to prey vpon
such carrions, and saith, Ez. 14. 17. sword, goe through the land. The Lord will hisse, Esa. 7. 18 for the flyes of Aegypt, and for the Be of Assiria to destroy Israel: and it is a iudgement, Esa. 3. 2. when God doth take away the man of warre, and Captaine of fifty, and yet Esa. 9. 5: euery battell of the warriour is with noyse, and with tumbling of garments in blond: and therefore when the warre is iust, and Gods cause is in hand, be prest and ready to come forth to helpe the Lord, to helpe the Lord against the mighty, breake the arme of the wicked, breake their hornes, break their barres, destroy all their munitions, as Hos. 10. 14. Shalman destroyed Arbel in the day of battaile; let the horsemen lift vp both the bright sword and glistering speare, let the foot-men bend their bowes, and make ready their arrowes vpon the string, let them presse forward with their boy strous billes and peircing pikes: let not Gilead abide beyond Iordan, nor Dan re∣maine in shippes, nor Asher sit on the Sea shore, let the people offer themselues willingly, let them all come as a whirle-winde to scatter Gods enemies, and cry downe with them, downe with them, euen to the ground: this may they doe any thing in this Commaudement notwith∣standing it. Thou shalt not kill: Mens lawes extende but to the out∣warde man, condemning him onely as guilty of murther, who pollutes and defiles his hands in an others bloud: The Pharisees and best expounders of the law, did but bite a∣bout the barke of this law, not enter into the marrow of it, but the law is spirituall  AND  are of great affi∣nity, and therefore our Sauiour Christ telles vs, that this Commandement doth binde the heart and the tongue, as well as the hands to the good abearing, the heart condem∣ning him of the breach of it, who is angry with his brother. Anger is a malitious desire of reuenge, and will exercise the armes of the strong, and tongues of the weake; it is a sinne that lyeth grinding in the entralles, and perswa∣ding reason to dissemble and the party wronged to bee a∣uenged, and if it sinde no vent the heart will cleaue a∣sunder, as the waters vndermine when they cannot ouer∣flow: the angrie and malicions man (for anger and ma∣lice differ but in time, and as old new wine) cannot
igest nor cast vp the least displeasure, but will bee vio∣lent in pursuite of small indignities, and vse what meanes hee can to put in practise that which desire of reuenge doth put into his head: A sinne directly against God, for hee that reuengeth, steps into Gods chaire of estate, and takes the sword out of his hand, who saith, Rom. 12 19. vengeance is mine. A sinne against a mans owne selfe, not only for losse of pa∣tience, but for that the remembrance or requitall of a wrong doth many times hurt as much as the receipt of it: how many haue been seene to lye dead, because they would not take the Lye? how many had their bloud seene, because they would not haue their backes seene? The Bee might keepe her stinge still, and not liue a drone, did shee not in her anger imploy it to enuenome the flesh of him that puts her from him, it is safer to forget an iniury or smother it, then goe about to auenge, it euery reuenge giueth occasion of new cruelties, & therefore one saith, if thine enemy be little, let him alone, and thou doest him a fauour, but if he be great, let him alone, and thou doest fauour thy selfe: it is good counsell therefore which the Holy Ghost giueth, Rom. 12. 19. giue place to wrath. Dum furor in cursu est, currenti cede furori, Neither looke so much on him that doth thee wrong, as on God who suffreth him, and raiseth vp an enemy as a scourge to chastise thy faults, and know that if any wrong can conquer thee, thou hast not conquered thy selfe. Againe this Comman∣dement tyes vp the tongue, so that reproachfull and contumeli∣ous words goe not out at the doores of our lippes, as Mat. 5. 22 Racha thou foole, or like words of disgrace, which chollericke men shoote forth, when anger hath inflamed their hearts, and made their mouthes hotter then Dan. 3. 19 Nabucadnezzars Ouen, when it is made seauen times hotter then it is wont; not but that a man may be angry when Gods cause is in hand, with aduised speach and in a seasonable time, as was Ex. 32. 19 Moses, Nu. 25. 8. Phinehes and Ioh. 2. 15 Christ himselfe, impatience in Gods iniuries is as com∣mendable, as patience is laudable in our owne wrongs, and they whose bloud doth not rise when they heare God rent and torne in peeces with carrion and stinking mouthes, are as much to blame as they, who prodigall of their bloud, doe point the field to reuenge a disgracefull word against themselues, nor yet
but that a man may vtter some contumelious word, so it be by way of aduice to direct or correct, for Paul Gal. 3. 1. called the Galathi∣ans fooles Luc. 13. 32. Christ, Herod a foxe, euen let thy friends see, that thou louest them by thy approbation, and that thou louest not their faults by such sharpe reproofes; otherwise that curse will light vpon thee, which did vpon the in habitants of Meroz, which came not forth Iud. 5. 23. to helpe the Lord, to helpe the Lord against the mighty: alwaies see that sharpe words which proceed of some heate come not of any hate, except it be of the sinne thou see committed. Michaell the Archangell, when he said vnto Satan, Iud 9. the Lord rebuke thee, would teach vs not to auenge our selues by euill speaking, but refer the matter to God: when it was tolde Aristotle, that one rayled on him behinde his backe, when I am away (saith he) let him beate me too. When one asked Octauian the Emperour, why doing good to all men, he suffered some to murmur against him, he answered, he that hath made Rome free from enemies, hath also set at libertie the tongues of malicious men. The answere of Beza to a Spanish Iesuite is worth the obseruation, worthy the imitation, the Iesuite, saith he, disputing about the Eucharist called vs (this is in an Epistle which he writeth to Caluin) vulpes, et serpentes, et simias, Foxes and Serpents and Apes: my answere was this, non magis nos credere quam transubstantiationem, we did no more beleeue this, then we did transubstantiation: this man was made of a mettle more flexible then hard, his shoulders were broad enough to beare the foule words were offered vnto him, he was like the waters of Siloe, at the foote of Sion Esa. 8 6. which run softly, he made but small noyse though he heard great words, whose example may teach vs not to be so light as to be moued with the breath of mans mouth so shall we be aboue Nature, while wee seeme below ourselues. Lastly as this Commandement tyes vp the tongue, that it burst not forth into words, before a conceiuing spirit hath de∣liuered them, that it be not like Gunpowder, which touched with the least sparke will instantly be in the face, so it sets a watch before the eyes, that they doe not sparkle with rage, that the browes be not bent, as if anger had there plowed the fur∣rowes of her wrath, it keepes our countenance that we doe not
swell like toades, when they be touched, it bindeth other mem∣bers of the body from all froward disposition whatsoeuer: if our bloud boy leth at the heart, as brimstone at the match, if our perturbations boyle our hearts into brine, and eate the moisture out of our flesh, if Gen. 4. 6. Cains countenance be cast downe, that he doth lowerlooke his brother Abel, if they Mat. 27. 30. 39. spit vpon Christ, bow their knees, and doe him reuerence, if they who goe by at his passion wagge their heads, if the Iewes A.▪ 7. 5. gnash vpon Steuen with their teeth: if the tyrant that martyred Saint Laurence stamp and stare, rampe and fare as one out of his wits, if his eyes glow, his teeth grinde like an hell-hound, his mouth foome like a boare, if any, naso suspendit, as it is in the prouerbe, or medium ostendit digitum which Marciall calles im∣pudicum. These & euery one of these, though their sinne growes to no further height, are guiltie of the breach of this Comman∣dement, when the minde and members of the body be thus out of tune, men are like a troubled spring, wherein if a man looke thinking to behold the image of a man, he can see no part of his right composition, in this case men make themselues fooles, which otherwise are not, and shew themselues fooles which are so, did I say fooles? nay very beasts, and the diuels are againe entered into a heard of swine, when some being glut∣tons feede greedily, some being thankelesse, looke not vp to God the giuer of goodnes no more then the swine to the tree from whence their acornes come, when some being couetous are still moyling & rooting in the earth, when some being an∣gry are still foming by malice: be therefore neither chafed in the minde as a beare robbed of her whelpes in the field, neither let anger be in the eyes, looke not with a sower countenance, with Num. 24. 10. angry Balak doe not smite thy hands together, let thy carriage be courteous, and thy dealing without disdaine, be amiable and affable to all, looke for an answere, a contemptu∣ous carriage of the body is a preparatiue to hatred, and murder which this Commandement forbiddeth. Thou shalt not kill: As men must not bath their butcherly swords in the precious life of man, nor compasse them about to take away their soules; so on the other side the soules of men (to 1. Sam. 26. 21. vse Saules words vnto Dauid) being pretious in our eyes, and their liues much set by, must carefully be preserued
to this end God commanded that he Deu. 22. 8 which builded a new house, (houses then were so builded that men might walke vp∣on them, as . Sā. 11. 2. Dauid did vpon the roofe of the Kings Pal∣lace) should make a battelment on the roofe lest he did lay bloud vpon his house, if any fell from thence: againe Deu. 20. 10. that before warre, their should goe a Proclamation of peace, againe that if a Seruant did fly from his Master not for any theft, whoredome or notable offence, but because his Master was cruell, Deu. 23. 15. he to whom he did fly should be as his sanctuary, and he should not deliuer him to his Master: but what neede further proofe hereof when we see that God commanded Ex. 23. 5. to helpe vp our enemies Asse, if he did lye vnder his burden. First therefore our owne liues must be deere vnto vs, and our bodyes being ruinous houses must haue cost bestowed on them, to keepe them tenentable and in good reparations, and therefore miserable minded men are much to blame, who spare not their bodyes, but pinch and defraud them of due nourish∣ment, whereby they so dry their braine that they soone bring their dayes to an end: The Apostle Paul as he will not haue men take thought for the flesh Rom. 13. 14. to fulfill the lusts of it: so he blam∣eth those Col. 2. 23. which haue not the body in any estimation to sa∣tisfie the neede of it, and therefore he biddeth Timothie, 1. Tim. 5. 23. hee should drinke no longer water, but vse a little wine for his stomackes sake, and his often infirmities: Againe some Schollers are too blame who surfet of immoderate study, neglecting their bo∣dyes to satisfie their mindes, when their weakenes checkes them, and their bodyes controle them, they should not affect so much knowledge, but debarre themselues of their chosen felicitie, hauing more respect to the health of the body, then wealth in the braine. Againe we must carefully looke to the safety of our brothren, that their dayes may be long in the land, that fulfilling the number of their yeares, they may goe to the graue in a full age. Mat. 15. 22. The Cananite is carefull for her sicke daughter, Ioh. 4. 47. the ruler for his sicke sonne, the Mat. 8. 5. Centurion for his sicke Seruant: Luc. 10. 33. the Sa∣maritan for the wounded stranger, Mat. 4. 24 the multitude for all sicke people, that were taken with diuers diseases and gripings, and them that were possessed with diuels, and those which were lunatike, and those that had the Palsey: Pompey, when there was a great dearth in
Rome, hauing prouided store of corne abroad shipped the same intending presently to relieue the hungry and thirsty, whose soule fainted in them, and while the mariners were backward in hoysing sayle, by reason of a tempest, he himselfe being ve∣r forward first entred, vsing these words, , it were better for vs to dye, then not set forward, pre∣ferring the reliefe of many before the safety of a few. Nature hath ingraffed in beasts without reason, a care to preserue one anothers life; and therefore Harts swimming ouer great Ri∣uers, when they goe to rut in some Iles, place the strongest formost, the second staies his necke on the backe of the first, the third on the second, so all to the last: and the first being weary, an other takes his place, thus (like Act. 27. 44 Paules company on boards and certaine peeces of the shippe) they come all safe to lande: that there may be this care one of anothers wel∣fare, we must loue one another, for where loue is not, men are so farre from seeking to preserue life, that they seeke to take it away: Amos 5. 10. they hated him (saith the Prophet) that rebuked in the gate: Es. 29. 21 they tooke him in a snare (saith another Prophet) which reproued them in the gate: Gen. 27. 41. If Esau hateth Iacob, hee will make reckoning to kill him: Gen. 37. 18. If Iosephs brethren hate Ioseph, they will lay their heads together to slay him, malice would dis∣patch him whom it hateth, and therefore Saint Paul recko∣ning vp a bedrowle of sinnes against charity, Gal. 5. 20 begins with hatred, and ends with murder, for the one by degrees and steps, riseth vp to that cruell height of iniquity: but where loue is, there is compassion: when our brethren vndergoe any losse or any crosse, if they are set as a marke to shoote at, and hunted as a Lyon, if the arrowes of the Almighty are in them, and the venome thereof doth drinke vp their spirits, if we loue them, they doe not more feele the burden of their misery, then we are grieued to see their distresse: neither are we onely fel∣low commoners with them in their sufferings, but are as a∣ctiue in kindnesse, as passiue in a sensible feeling of their sor∣row, we are not in stile, but indeed serui sernorum Dei, and therefore if God visit any with sicknesse, so that either with the 2 K. 4. 19 Shunamites sonne they cry out, my head▪ my head▪ or with, Asa,a 2 Mac. 9. 5. my feete, my feete, or with 2 Chr. 16. 12. Antiochus, my bowels, my bowels, if Mat. 8. 14 with Peters wiues mother they complaine of a feuer, with
the Mat. 8. 5. Centurions seruant of a palsey, if diseases bereaue them of their appetite, so that they surfet of the very smell, nay of the very sight, nay of the very thought of the best dishes, if sicknesse bereaue them of rest, so that they weary themselues with changing sides, and counting the lingring houres, thinke that the sunne stands still, Ios. 10. 13 as it did in the daies of Ioshua, or 2 K. 20 11 goe backe, as it did in the daies of Ezechias; if we loue them, we will with the Mat. 8. 5 Centurion goe and speake for them: Mat. 2. 4. with the Porters we will for their recouery set too our helping hands. Rise, while it is yet darke, not put out our candle by night, we will girde our loynes and strengthen our hands to good: Againe if they be oppressed, so that great men with their ta∣lones and pawes catch at them, prey vpon them, make ha∣uocke of all they haue, and like the sea, making a rupture leaue neither land nor house nor trees, but play sweepe-stake, if we loue them, we not onely grieue to see charity, (which in Christs daies was waxen cold, and in Basils daies was dried vp) to be now quite dead, to see how much more cunning men are in substraction then diuision; but wee are painfull to helpe them, and so willing, that no paine can weare vs, wee vse all good meanes we can to deliuer them from their op∣pressors, Esa. 1. 15. whose hands are full of blond, whose hearts are as hard as yron, and as the nether milstone, who thinking themselues ill seated while they dwell by neighbours, depo∣pulate Parishes, and being caterpillers and cormorants of the earth, like whales of the sea, swallow vp quicke other lit∣tle fishes, who like Lyons deuoure other beasts, like Kites seaze, plume and prey vpon other birds, like greedy wol∣ues deuoure all, and are indeed like the Asses iaw-bone Iud. 15. 15 with which Sampson flew a thousand men. Againe, if they suffer want of things necessary, so that being hungry and thirsty their soule faint in them, if we loue them, our plenty shall sup∣ply their penury, according to our abllity, we will fulfill their want, as riuers fill vp the empty places as they passe by, loue will driue vs to compassion, and compassion to reliefe, and therefore to conclude, by loue be linked one to an other, as by faith you are vnited to God, Ex. 26. 6. like the crtaines of the Ta∣bernacle, be twisted and knit together, be alwaies paying this debt, yet thinke you are debters still, put on this liuery
coate, Ioh. 13. 35. whereby you are knowne to be the seruants of God, Rō. 13. 8. this is the complement of the law, Ioh. 13. 34 the supplement of the Gospell, the fulfilling of this Commandement, Thou shalt not kill. The seuenth Commandement. Exod. 20. 14, Thou shalt not commit Adultery. CHildren and the fruit of the wombe, are an heri∣tage and gift that commeth of the Lord; but be∣ausea Ps. 127. 3. Mal. 2. 15 God sought c a Godly seede, such as should be borne in lawfull wedlocke; in this Commande∣ment he or biddeth vs to run vpon the rockes of vncleannes, & so make shipwracke of all honest behauiour, and comman∣deth vs to keepe our selues chaste, as vndefiled members of Christs body: This is (as the Apostle speaketh) to possesse our vessels in holines and honour, and not in the lust of concupis∣cence, euen as the Gentiles, which knew not God.1 Thos. 4. 4. Saint Paul maketh the breach of this Commandement to branch it selfe into these parts, Adultery, Frnication, vncleannes, wantnnes; on each of which I must be resident in this discourse,Gal. 5. 19. as they present themselues in order to your view. Adultery is the infringing of the faith plighted in mar∣riage, when the husband shall turne to euill, and commit a trespasse against his wife or the wife shall turn to euill & com∣mit a trespasse against her husband, for Adulterium is quasi ad al∣teriusGen. 49. 4. torum, the going vp to anothers bed, as Iacob saith of Reu∣ben, when man and wife forgetting their faith plighted one to another shall turne to vncleannes one from another: A sinne worse then simple fornication, for herein is a breach of coue∣nant, herein is an intrusion of the base borne into the inheri∣tance or possessions of the children, which are lawfully begot∣ten):Deu. 23. 22 29. and therefore by the law a sorer punishment was infli∣cted vpon it, for the Adulterer was put to death, and the fornicator to his fine. If a rich man steale, men thinke he deserues to bee puni∣shed,
seuen times more then the poore man, who stealeth to satisfie his neede, when he is hungry, for he hauing meanes to maintaine himselfe is without excuse. In Nathans parable Dauid sets his face against the man, and thinkes him worthy to be cut off from among his people, who hauing many Sheepe2 Sam. 12. and Oxen, tooke the poore mans Sheepe to dresse for his stranger: if lust doth lodge whithin the married mans breast and the vehemency of affection would perswade him to folly, God hath giuen him a wife, good meanes, and a lawfull re∣medy to cause euill to depart from his flesh, now if such a one embrace the bosome of a stranger, and will haue the same con∣iunction with an harlot in wickednesse, which he might haue with his lawful wife in holines, & by the appointemēt of God, this man, or rather this beast is like a rich theefe which stealeth. If a man falsefie a couenant in bargaining, either by sub∣ornation of witnesses, or conueying vnder hand some secret title, it may bee made a Starre-Chamber matter: marriage is Mal. 2. 14 a couenant betwixt man and wife, Pro. 2. 17 a couenant of God, a couenant made before God and his Congregation, where∣by man and wife promise to keepe themselues one to an other, and to no other, so long as they both shall liue: If now either of them shall breake their faith and troth thus plighted, what can be pleaded in their defence? what but bloud can expiate this sinne? therefore Iudah, c though there was little honesty in his fact, yet desired not the company of an other woman, tillGē. 38. 12 his owne wife had yeelded vp her spirit, and gone the way of all flesh. maketh protestatiō of his innocency in this respect, defi∣ring God, that if he be guilty this way, his wife might be made a slae, and other men might d bow downe vpon her. The beasts by nature make difference betwixt these sins, for they say thatIob 31. 9. the Lyon, if he meetes with an Adulterer, knowes him, sets vp∣on him, and teares him in peees, not vsing the like rage against single fornicators: It is written of the Storke, that whereso∣euer he flyes, he comes in no neast but his owne, and if any of their company leauing his owne mate, ioyneth with any other, all the rest fall vpon him, beate him, and plucke his fea∣thers from him. This condemneth the Nicholaitaes, a sect of Hereticks,
which held that wiues should be common, who tooke their beginning from Nicholas one of the seuen Deacons, for he be∣ing blamed for ielousie, brought forth his beautifull wife a∣mong all the Disciples, saying who so would, should vse her:Reu. 2. 6. the holy Ghost commendeth the Church of Ephesus for dislik∣ing this sect. Againe this condemneth the Anabaptists who treading in the steps of the Nicholaitans argue thus, all things should be common, therefore wiues, but one writeth of them that they be like the fox in the fable, who hauing lost her tayle, would haue all the foxes cut off theirs, that so her pri∣uate shame might be the lesse, when the calamitie was com∣mon to them all. In a word, it condemneth all such as being hot as an Ouen, like fedde horses ney, euery one after his neigh∣bors wife, who delighting in dallyance and looking on strange women croake in the Chambers like the frogges of Egypt. Yet what fault so common as this, it may be said of some Cities (I would it were proper to Cities) as it was sometime of Rome, vrbs est iam tota lupanar: the whole Citie is nothing else but a common stewes men holde it the safest way to drinke of a couered cup, and whereas Plato held, all things should be common but wiues (Clemens the first did not except them) now nothing so common as they, many are become like Cuccoes, which lay their egges in other birds nestes, Seruants are not now of Iosephs minde, who was backward in yeelding to hisGen. 39. 12 Mistresse, though she caught him by his garment, saying sleepe with me: considering the time is short, they which haue wiues should be1. Cor. 7. 29. as though they had none: but now they which haue no wiues be as though they had wiues, such a one was he who bragging of the villany he had done, and happely more then he had done, would say, that though he were neuer marryed, yet he had two or three or foure wiues: Onan would not raise vp seede toGen. 38. 9. another man, and therefore sinned as much as a woman, which destroyes the fruit of her body, but now men, laying waite at their neighbours doore, are ready to raise vp seede to other men, let therefore wedlocke be chaste, let the window of the Arke be shut, that the waters of the floud doe not enter into it: God hath set bounds to the sea, and said here shall stay thy rag∣ing waues, so hath he made the wife a bounde for mans raging affection: and when man is ioyned to a woman in marriage he
must thinke he is at a non plus, and learne to direct humors to their right courses and draw the floud of affections to their owne chanell: The wife is a vine, and the husband must bindesa. 128. 3. his affection to her, as Iudah tye his Asse vnto the Vine. In theGen. 49. 11 Arke were no more men, then women, no more women then men, foure for foure, that each might learne to content himselfe with one, and it is worth the obseruation, that when they en∣ter into the Arke, the holy Ghost putteth the men by them∣selues, and women by themselues: as Noah and his sonnes: No∣ahsGen. 7. 7. 13 wife and his sonnes wiues: to shew that when iudgement is toward, they which haue wiues should be as though they had none, that they may giue themselues vnto prayer: but when they goe out of the Arke, God ioynes them together, goe forth of the Arke, thou and thy wife: thy sonnes and thy sonnes wiues with thee to shew that when iudgement is past they must come toge∣ther againe, that Satan tempt them not for their incontinency,1. Cor. 7. 5. but this note came but in by the way, and shall not carry me so far out of the way, but I will keepe my selfe resident vpon my Text: let euery man haue his wife saith Saint Paul, his wife,1. Cor. 7. 2. not his concubine, his wife, not his wiues, and they two, not they three, shall be one flesh: to shew that none must be sicke of a Plu∣risie,Edh. 5. 31. or be like the diuell which sowed another mans ground:Mat. 13. 25 if God had dispensed with any, it is like Kings should haue had this priuiledge, that they might haue had an heire of their owne body to succeede them, when their owne, wiues went childles: but euen Kings come within the compasse of this pro∣hibition, neither shall any of them take him many wiues: whenDe. 17. 17 a man seeth his flesh grow prowde and boyleth vnto lust, of necessitie he must take a wife, or else fall, but if he fall hauing taken a wie, he is like a Pilot, which suffereth shipwracke, when he is come to the hauen, or like Lots wife which is cast away though she hath escaped out of Sodome and might haue been saued in Zar. It was therefore a good answere which aGen. 19. 29 married woman in Lacedemonia, made to a young man who de∣sired her company, young man, quoth she, I would grant that thou askest, were it mine to grant, but that which thou de∣mandest, while I was single, was my parents, they had a care to preserue it, now I am married, it is my husbands, only hee must haue it: it was as good which the Lady Gray made vnto
King Edward the 4, the first of our English Kings, who mar∣ried a subiect: for when he, being enamored of her, would haue proceeded further, she hearing of a mariage concluded for him in France, and of a precontract with the Lady Lucy, plainely tolde him, she knew her selfe too simple to be his wife, and thought her selfe to good to be his concubine: The exam∣ple of Alexander is worth the remembrance who hauing con∣quered Darius, and alwaies hauing in his host the wife of the same Darius, would after he had once seene her beautie, neuer after haue her once come in his presence, saying, it would be a great shame to him, who had conquered the husband, now to be subdued by the wife. It is written of the Parthians, that they forbid their wiues not only to conuerse with men, but not so much as to talke with them, or cast an eye vpon them, yet they themselues marching vnder Venus banner, will haue many wiues, but this is as much as if they should bid them fight a∣gainst enemies, fight against pleasures, to which they would yeeld themselues: the man is the head of the woman, the head1. Cor. 11. 3 should goe before, the members follow after, if the woman liue more chastly then the man, the house is out of order, and the head doth hang downeward. The meanes to keepe chastitie is loue betwixt man and wife, for as hee, which loues an harlot hates his wife, so hee which loues his wife hates an harlot, and therefore Salomon dehorting from the strange woman, wisheth vs to reioyce with the wife ofPro. 5. 8. 18 19. our youth, and delight in her loue continually: this loue is armour of proofe, and will not suffer vnchast thoughts to enter into the heart: First therefore knit hearts before you strike hands, first be heart fasted, then hand fasted, first chose your loue, then loue your choise, like the bridegrome and the spouse in the Canticles. call one another loue: therefore the husband the first yeare hee was married was freed from the warre, thatDeu. 24. 5. loue might grow vp as the water cresses, little by little but with a deepe roote, where this is in the man another womans person shall not be the prison of his heart, nor lodge within his breast, his eyes shall not looke vpon strange women, nor his flesh yeeld to the seruice of Venus: where this is in the wo∣man she girdeth her loynes with strength, her heart is not de∣ceiued by a man, where this is wanting in man or woman, they
are ready to embrace the bosome of strangers, to ouerflowe the bankes of chastitie, to set fire to their honesty, to violate the rites of matrimony, and set forth marriage to all rproach and villany: for though they dwell together in one house, yet are they like two poysons in one stomacke, one is sicke of another like Eles in the pot which would faine be out, like Spaiels coupled, which hale, one one way, another another way, and if they goe any time quietly together, it is because they cannot goe a sunder, and though matrimony be a con∣iunction, yet in such it is a coniunction disinuctiue, as are ioyn∣ed in body, but disioyned in affection: hereupon it comes to passe that some in these dayes are as ready to venture their liues for a common wench, as other in former times, haue been forward to hazard them for the common-wealth: hereupon it comes to passe that man and wife, alledging some foule plea to clowt vp their foule play seeke to be separated one from the other: those whom God hath ioyned together man should not put a sunder, the woman is bound by the law to the man whileRom. 7. 2. he liueth: and on the other side, the man to the woman: Kings are bound with these chaines and Nobles with these linkes of yron, but when man and wife loue not, they will not be tyed with this tackling, they breake these bonds a sunder, & cast a∣way these cordes frō them, the hart of the husband must cleaue to his wife, the heart of the wife must cleaue to her husband: the wife is the glory of the man, euery man loueth his glory: they two are one flesh, & as God at first made two of one by resoluti∣on,Gen. 2. 22. so marriage makes one of two by composition: they are two boughes of one tree, & together beare one fruite, as a sience taken from one tree and grafted in another stocke, and as children are a mans selfe multiplyed, so the wife is a mans selfe diuided: Adam saith she is flesh of my flesh, if any man hatethGen. 2. 23. his owne flesh, he is carried to Bedlem, and is like 1. Kin. 18. 28. the Ba∣alits which wounded their owne bodyes, Leu. 19. 28. contrary to the Commandement; Man had his make made of his owne flesh, and so had no creature beside, and therefore man should exceed all other creatures in the loue of his make: and therefore Darius aforesaid, when Alexander the great had ouercome him, yet shewed himselfe stoute and inuincible, till he vnderstood his wife was taken prisoner, at hearing whereof his heart did melt,
his knees did smite together, sorrow was in all his loynes, be∣ing more grieued for her imprisonment, then losse of his owne liberty, victory, credit and estimation. Againe, concerning the woman, shee was taken out of the side of man neere the heart, when she was first made, and when shee is married, there is a ring put by her husband on the fourth finger of her left hand, where there is a veine which goes to the heart, to teach their to loue him from the heart. The Chronicle stores vs with a cluster of many singular ex∣amples of this loue: some for loue to her husbands haue been content to hazard their estate as: Some haue been content to leaue their Countrey, when Lntulus Crustelio was banished into Sicily, Sulpicia followedGen. 12. her husband, like Sarah, for when Abraham by Gods comman∣dement left his Countrey, shee without commandement left her Countrey also: as if shee should say to her husband, as Ruth to Naomi, whither thou goest, I will g, and where thou dwel∣lest,Ruth. 1. 16. 17. I will dwell, where thou diest, I will die, and there will I bee buried, the Lord doe so to mee and more also, if ought but death de∣part thee and mee. Some haue been content to loose their goods, to loose their good name, to loose their liues. When Guel∣fus and other Noble men with their wiues were taken priso∣ners, after a siege in the Castle of Winsberg, the women hauing leaue to goe away, and carry with them, whatsoeuer they could beare on their shoulders, they leauing all other things, tooke vp their husbands, and away they went. A woman (as we read in the Acts and Monuments) defa∣med herselfe to deliuer her innocent husband, it was Calaway a Gold-smith in London, who should haue been cast away, had it not been for his wife, for he being indited of a crime, which was death by the law, and might not haue the benefit of his clergy, because hee had married a widow (for the law was that Bigamus might not haue his booke, and he was accoun∣ted bigamus, who had been twise married himselfe, or else had married a woman, whose former husband was dead) his wife came forth before the Iudges and deposed, that shee neuer was married to him that was accounted her first husband, but li∣ued in adultery with him. When Nero condemned Seneca to
dye, he gaue him leaue to chuse what death he would dye, whereupon he caused his veines to be opened in a Bath, his wife Paulina of her owne accorde did the like, choosing ra∣ther to dye with him, then liue without him. I cannot omit one example of an English Queene, and that is Eleonor wife to King Edward the first, for when he going to the holy Land was wounded by a Morian with a sword so enuenomed, that art and medecine could not cure him, this good & louing wife with her owne mouth, did day by day sucke and drawe out the venemous humour, and without hurting herselfe helped her husband, cured and closed his wound, in remembrance of whose great affection, King Edward did build her many mo∣numents. A second breach of this law, and branch to bee cut off is Fornication, which though it be not so great sinne as Adulte∣ry, as I haue already proued, yet flye Fornication: for these1 Cor. 6. 18 things are common to both these sinnes, a diseased body, a damned soule, a poore purse, a shamefull name, a wronging of posterity, and of the party with whom the folly is commit∣ted: For the first, these finne against their owne bodies, wa∣sting their strength in pleasure, as the flame consumeth the candle, and therefore are like Sparrowes, which Aristotle saith, doe therefore liue but a short time, because of their common copulation: they procure to themselues such infecti∣ous diseases, as will hasten their death, and such as will sticke by them, when their best friends giue them ouer. Concerning their soules, Saint Paul excludeth them from1 Cor. 9. 6 the Kingdome of heauen; as he will haue them separated from1 Cor. 5. 9 11. 13. the company of men vpon earth. Concerning their estate, pouerty commeth vpon them as one that trauaileth by the way, and necessity like an armed man: this sinne is purgatory to the purse, though it be para∣dise to the desires, Danae doth then like Iupiter, when he comes vnto her in the forme of a showre of golden rayne, and there∣fore the Poet saith; Nuda Venus picta est, nudi pinguntur amores: Nam quos nuda capit, nudos dimittat, oportet. How soone had the prodigall childe consumed his portion,Luc. 15. 14 when once he light among harlots; but you will say, this
sinne may bring a meane man to pouerty, and a poore man to beggery, but great ones may wallow in this sinne, and yet their estate neuer be empaired, nay women are like enough to gaine by the trade, for they be receiuers, with Mat. 26. 15. Iudas they are at their Quantum dabis? as if their louers bring any thing, they are welcome, if any of them say with Peter, Act. 3. 6. Siluer andf Gen 38. 16. gold haue I none, ibit for as, there is no entertainement for him,f Thamar. the string of their hearts reach to the pulse of their hands, and must be rubbed with gold. Concerning Name, men haue a care of their credit, and would haue a good reputation among men, next to the ap∣probation of God and the testimony of a good conscience, for if a mans name be once tainted with iust reproch, postea nullus erit, but is like a garment, which once rent is like to be torne on euery nayle; now he that committeth adultery with a woman looseth his name, a bad report is his portion while he liueth, a bad heyre when he is dead, and such a one as shall outline all his posterity, his reproach shall neuer be put away: andro. 6. 33. it were well, if onely he himselfe did pay for it, but this is not all, but euen the children vnlawfully begotten doe feele the smart of it; for first the staine remaineth to them, and ba∣stardy is their blemish, then which, what can be a greater, and therefore when the holy Ghost would brande the Israelites with a marke of greatest reproch, he cals them the seede ofEsa. 51. 3. the Adulterer, and of the whore: Againe parents are not so care∣full of the good education of such children, their birth is not so base, but their bringing vp is as base as their birth, such fathers care not, though with the Israelites they offer such sonnes and daughters vnto diuels, they haue no care to cor∣rect them, they care not though they haue their swinge, though it be in an halter, and therefore the Lord compareth those, whom he corrects not vnto bastards, If yee be withoutHeb. 12. 8. correction, then are yee bastards and not sonnes: besides all this the Iewish law doth not allow such children the same priuiledges, which it doth those, which are lawfully begotten, for first they were not called to places of publicke gouernement, either in Church or common wealth; and secondly, they were excluded from inheritance: and therefore when Iphthas brethren were come to age, they thrust out Iphtah (the onely base borne in
the Scripture which wee reade of came to good, and hee is set downe lest bastards should despaire, and none but he, lest parents should presume) and said vnto him, thou shalt not inherit inIud 11. 2. our fathers house, for thou art the sonne of a strange woman. A wise traueler when he cometh to his Inne, though many plesant dishes be presented to his sight, yet he forbeareth them in consideration of the price: we are here trauelers towards Ierusalem which is aboue, this world is but a baiting place to goe to another, here the harlot saith, as in the Prouerbes, I haue Peace offrings: meate at home to make good chere, I haue deck∣edPro. 7. 14 my bed with ornaments, &c. Come let vs take our fill of loue vntill the morning, let vs take our pleasure in dalliance: all this founds well, but taste of her cates and delicates, and how hard is the reckoning? the body must pay for it, for howsoeuer Dalilah speakes faire, yet in the end shee bereaues Sampson ofIud. 16. 19. his strenghth, of his sight and of himselfe: and yet the shot is not paide, but thy soule must goe to the reckoning, for thou postest to hell on the backe of vnciuill pleasures, if thou think∣est that now all is discharged, thou reckonest without thy host and therefore must reckon twice, thy goods must goe to the paiment. This sinne maketh euen the couetous man prodigall, as thy goods so thy good name must make vp the shot: & when thou thinkest all is discharged, there comes an after reckoning, and thy posterity must pay it, thy bastardly generation, & the children wich are not yet fashioned in their mothers wombe▪ I had rather want a little hony, then thus be stung with the pai∣ment, I like not the Scorpion, which goeth ouer the body ve∣ry smothily, but stingeth with the tayle, nor yet the gnats, which making musicke about the eares, doe euermore sting or they part, nor yet such pleasures, as like tragedies haue as bitter ends, as they haue sweete beginnings. When that famous or rather infamous harlot Lais demanded of Demo∣sthenes a round summe of money for one nights lodging, hee gaue off his suite with these words, Nolo tanti emere poenitentiam, I will not buy repentance so deare: If one single coarde was strong enough, to drawe Demosthenes from fleshlie delights, then what shall a threefold coarde doe vs, nay a coarde which is fiue times doubled? When the mother of Lemuel would disswade him from giuing his
strength vnto women, she puts him in minde that he is a manPor. 31. 2. 1. Cor. 6. 20. of worth: Wee are men of worth, bought with a price, but if we yeeld to fleshly delights, we shew our selues base, pleasures, they say, are for the body and the body for the soule, and there∣fore if this sinne reigne in vs we are become seruants to our seruants seruant. And therefore the lawe of Nature, before the lawe of God was written, did punish this sinne with death, Iudah, when he heard his daughter Tamar had played the harlot, and with playing the harlot was with childe, gaue this sentence, bringGen. 38. 24. her forth, and let her be burnt. The Aegyptians cut off the womans nose, and the mens members, Augustus Casar permitted the father to kil his daugh∣ter taken in adultery, Canutus a Danish King in this land did banish them. Tenedius a King in another land did cut them in sunder with an axe: Lex Iulia and the lawe of Romulus, did put them to death, and therefore the Pope is to blame, who al∣loweth of Courtisans, which pay tribute for licence to be com∣men whores: Much to be misliked was that iudgement giuen against Theodora in the 7. persecution of the primitiue Church, who because she refused to doe sacrifice to the Idols, was therefore condemned to the stewes, though by the pollicie of Dydimus a Christian, who came and tooke on him her apparrell, and sent her out in his, shee kept her selfe chaste: let the Church, which is a Virgine married to Christ keepe one faith, and let all that are married one to another keepe the same office in flesh, which the Church keepeth in faith, let young men with Ioseph striue manfully to subdue this sinneCen. 39. 9. knowing that chastity is grace to the body, beautie to the soule and peace to the desires. A third sinne which the Apostle reckons among the workes of the flesh is vncleannes, which is a generall word compre∣hending the two former sinnes and stretcheth yet further, con∣demning the sinne of the Sodomites when man with man workes filthines. and therefore to blame was Sixtus the 4. who built a costly Stewes in Rome appointing it to be both maseuline and feminine, making a gaine of that most beastly sinne, giuing the whole familie of the Cardinall of Saint Luce free leaue in Iune, Iuly and August to vse that sinne for committing whereof God
reigned vpon Sodome and Gomorah fire and brimstome fromen. 19. 24 heauen, A bird of the same feather was Iohn Casus Archbishop of Beneuentane, the Popes Legate to the Venetians, who magni∣fied this sinne not in word alone, but commended the same in writing: but as Phoion did thinke he had spoken somewhat a∣misse, because the common sort commended his Oration: so thinke the worse of this sinne, because such lewde persons giue it such allowance and so great commendation. Buggery with beasts is another sinne comprehended vnder this vncleannes a sinne so hated of God, that the innocentLeu. 20. 15. and harmeles beast should dye as well as the party that com∣mitted the fact: Other sinnes of like sort, which nature doth abhorte and chaste eares will not willingly heare, the very thought whereof woundeth the heart with horrour, I purpose∣ly passe ouer, and come to the last branch which is wantonnes, and this is either inward or outward, inward in the heart, for he that lusteth after a woman hath committed adultery with herMat. 5. 28. already in his heart, and God did punish the resolution Gen. 12. 17 in Pha∣raoh and Gen. 20. 3 Abimelech though neither of them had come nigh vnto Abrahams wife: we haue a saying: thought is free: but the Apostle saith, I had not knowne that lust had been sinne, except theRom. 7. 7. law had said, thou shalt not lust: I know this sinne shrowdes it selfe vnder the habit of vertue, and as cleanlynes doth couer pride, thirst doth couer couetousnes, so the conueyance is not cleanely, except the outside of loue doth couer the inside of lust, thus the diuell will not shew vs sinne in it right colours, but with the spider weaues a fine webbe to hang the fly with∣all, and with Alcibiades imbroyders a curtaine with Lyons and Eagles to couer his pictures of Owles and Apes: but we must take the visour from this sinne, that it may appeare as it is, re∣iect it though it comes with a maske, giue it no counteuance though vnder a good colour it would insinuate it selfe: The best weeding is to plucke vp the rootes, lust is the roote of sin, which bringeth forth a bitter fruite, the holy Ghost will not suffer aDeu. 29. 18 roote that springeth forth Gall and Wormewood, but will haue it weeded out: When the trees did see that yron milles consumed them so fast, they layd their heads together and concluded vp∣on this, they would not lend to any axe so much as an helfe, we are as trees, Gods iudgements an axe, our sinnes yeel matter
sufficient to cut vs downe, conclude vpon this not to yeeld so much as a thought, it is as easie to quench the flame of Aetna, as the thoughs set on fie by affection. Outward wantonnes is either in the body or the appurte∣nances, in the body, when the eye is wanton, the eare is wanton, the tongue is wanton, or when there is a wanton carriage of the whole body: The wanton eyes like Iacobs sheepe, too firmlyGen. 30. 39. fixed vpon beautifull obiects, make the affections bring forth spotted fruite: the eyes of Putiphars wife caused her to step a∣wry, vrit{que} videndo famina for glauncing forth their beames on Iosephs beautie, they made their reflexion on her heart withGen. 39 7. hot burning lust: sight is set downe as the originall both ofGen. 34. 2. 2. Sam. 11. Shechems and Dauids fall, the foolish eye like the spider gathers poyson of the best flowers, as the wise eye like the Bee gathers hony of the worst weedes. Ʋt vidi, vt perij, vt me malus abstulit error. And therefore when there were some who seemed to haue compassion vpon a one eyed man, he tolde them, he had lost one of his enemies, a very theefe which would haue stolne a∣way his heart; an Ienall makes it a wonder, that a certaien man who wanted both his eyes should be addicted to this sinne. Qui nunquam visae flagrabat amore puella. For true is the prouerbe, , lust creepes in at the window of this sense, as the enemy at the gates of Ierusalem, and pickes the locke of the strongest heart:Lam. 4. 12. Iob. 31. 1. therefore with Iob, we must make a couenant with our eyes, since Crce will inchaunt all that beholde her, hauing faculty at∣tractiue with the Ieate, and retentiue with the Diamond, whose face is like a glasse, wherein while the Lakes gaze, they are taken in the day net. Againe a wanton eare lettes in lust: The Basilike or Coca∣tricePro. 7. is so venomous, that he slayeth with his sight: the Syrens sing so sweetly, that they allure all that lend them their eaes, to come vnto them, as Venus is a Basiliske, and men must shut their eyes, and not gaze at her, least they perish, so is shee a Syren, and men must stop their eares at her melody, like Vlisses souldiers, or the deafe Adder which refuseth to heare the voice of the Charmer, charme he neuer so wisely: the care must be like a srue which keeping in the good seede casteth
out the dust and iuory, and if with the draw-net in the Gospell, it hath taken all manner of things, with the men in that place, it must keepe the good as in a vessell and cast the bad away. A wanton tongue either in reading or in common talking, is another corde, which draweth on adultery, and a passage whereby it enters into the heart, euill speach corrupt good manners,1. Cor. 15. 33. what contents the tongue, to that consent the heart, & therfore if in reading any booke we meete with, any thing which may make way for this sinne, we must passe by it, as the Priest andLuc. 10. 31. Leuit by the wounded man, or deale as the Israelites with theDeu. 21. 1. captiue woman, pare away that which is superfluous lest we be like the Prodigall Child, who desired to be refreshed with the huskes that the swine did eate. As for wanton wordes, refuse them as much in thy talke, as poyson in thy meate: how foule a fault is it to be like the duckes, which still haue their billes in the mire? if thy tongue would faine run ouer, with Iob, lay thy hand vpon thy mouth, be like Dauid, who, as he desired to be a doore-keeper in GodsPsa. 141. 3. house, so desired God to be a doore-keeper in his house: Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and keepe the doore of my lippes. I will not speake heere of a wanton hand, either in writing or being worse imployed only it grieueth me, to see the best wits, lose themselues in the vainest follyes, to see good Clarkes serue Venus in Mineroues rayment to see great schollers long in trauaile, to be in fine deliuered of some lewde and idle phansie: to see Ouid spill much art in his booke de arte amandi, for which Augustus banished him, as knowing that young mindes would thereby be stirred vp vnto wantonnes: As the members of the body seuerally, may be arraigned and found guilty of this trans∣gression, so iointly together they may be indited for it, when there is a wanton carriage of the whole body at the same time,Psa. 3. 16. such as the daughters of Zion vsed who walked with stretched out neckes, and with wandring eyes, walking and minsing as they went, and making a tinkling with their feete: such as Dauncers commonly vse, and therefore Diogenes being asked what he thought of dauncing answered, the better, the worse, as though he thought the best dauncers the worst men: Chrysostome seemeth to dislke dauncing, we reade, saith he, of Ioh. 2. 1. a marriage feast, Mat. 22. 11. of mar∣riage garments, of Mat. 25. 7. Virgins going before with lampes, but of dauncing at marriages, saith he we reade not, as though hee
though it had not a iust warrant, because it wanted expresse mention. Now wantonnes in the appurtenances, and things belon∣ging to the body, shewes it selfe in wanton apparel, and strange diet, both these are instruments to strike vp a dance for adul∣tery: apparell whether wee consider the cost or the fashion: the cost, and therefore Lysander would not suffer his daughters to weare gorgeous attire; saying it would not make them so comely as common. Men therefore are to blame, which haue the cunning, that they can turne two or three hunderd acres of ground, into two or three trunkes of apparell, who to set ou themselues gorgeously sell away their land so long by the yarde, that they leaue not for themselues a foote; who can as easily carry many Oakes and Woods on their backes, a as1 Sa 1.  Golih carried in his hand a speare, as bigge as a weauers beame: to blame are women, who tire not themselues as holy women in times past, b who trusted in God, and were subect1 Pe. 3. 5 Esa. 3 1. to their husbands; but like the c daughters of Zon, must haue too much variety, and cloth their flesh like the Raine-bowe with garments of diuers colours. Not but that men of degree and calling may weare sumptuous habits according to the cu∣stome of the Country, and honour of their place, as in Kings houses d they weare soft rayment without reproofe; but whenMat. 11. . Luc. 16. 19 men beyond their degree and place must like the e rich man be cloathed in purple for ostentation, and fine linnen for delecta∣tion: when they must haue their faced and defaced garments, when they must apparell their apparell with ruffes on ruffes, laces on laces, cuts on cuts, when they must haue pearles to adorne the body, though the soule be robbed of her Iewels, when they must haue rich ornaments, not so much for vse and profit, as for a bragge, and to serue other mens eyes, this, this is lyable to reproofe, and they which put on this light attire, cannot lightly put on honest and chaste conuersation. Now for the fashion, attire is as strange in fashion, as the Gyants were monstrous in nature: and Adam was not so much ashamed of his nakednesse, as now men may be of their cloath∣ing: Honesty first inuented the seemely garment, to couer our vnseemely parts; Necessity the profitable garment, to defend vs from the iniury of the weather, but riches and riot did
find out the precious, which vanity did fashion to her tricke: & howsoeuer this land hath giuen other nations the foile, yet they haue giuen vs the fashion, the pride of all Countreys sits in our skirts, the follies of all Nations are fallen vpon vs, if there be a new toy or a new fashion, men, but especially wo∣men be sicke of the fashions, and neuer well till they haue it, though some of them with their fashions grow cleane out of fashion. But, ad quid perditio hac? whereto serueth this waste? there is no building to that, which is made without hands, no ioy to a quiet conscience, no cloathing to the righteous∣nes of Christ, put on therefore the Lord Iesus Christ, and letRom. 13. 14 not vnchaste behauiour shew it selfe in the gawdines of attire, what are silkes, but the excrements of wormes? what is gold, but the dregges of the earth? what are precious stones, but the rubble of the sea? compound thy garment of all these, and make it of the best fashion, yet art thou not clothed like g the lillyes of the field. Nature hath cladde beasts with an hayreMat. 6. 29. skin, and fowles with feathers, but man, because he is indu∣ed with reason, it brings forth naked, leauing his couering to good discretion, let apparell therefore be such, as shall not so much satisfie a curious eye, as beare witnes of a sober and chaste minde. Now for Diet, a full belly makes a foule heart: gluttony and drunkenes lead the dance, chambering and wantones fol∣low forthwith, fulnesse of bread bredde vneleannes in the Sodo∣mites:Rom. 13. 13 Ez. 16. 49. when the mouth is a tunnell, the throat a winepipe, the belly a barrell filled to the full, whoredome workes out: the rankest weeds grow out of the fattest soyle: and therefore as the b Apostle Saint Paul speaking of purity, speaketh first of2 Cor. 6. 6 Ier. 5. 7. 8. fasting, so the Prophet i Ieremy speaking of impurity and vn∣cleannes, speaketh first of feeding to the full: The body is a seathing pot, concupiscence is a fire, plentifull and costly diet doth kindle the fire: Venus in vinis: Venus warmes herselfe at the signe of the Iuie bush, and sine Cerere & Baccho friget Venus, not but that Paul and his acquaintance may meete at the mar∣ket of k Appins, and at the three tauernes▪, for as we may eateAct. 28. 15. 1 Cor. 10. 5. whatsoeuer l is sold in the shambles (though Pythagoras would eate of no liuing creature: as Essei people of Palestine would neuer eate Pigeons) and as the disciples might eate and drinke what∣soeuer
was et before them, ordinary and common victuals,Luc. 10. 7. so God hath giuen m wine to make glad the heart of man, and oyle to make him a cheerefull countenance: onely weePs. 104. 19 must take heed wee bee not irregulares gulares, and making the corps a cloake-bagge, and the gut a gulfe abuse Gods good gifts, and take thereby occasion to sinne. The eight Commandement. Exod. 20. 15. Thou shalt not steale. AMong other reasons why God would haue hisLeu. 11. 1. people Israel, abstaine from fowles liuing vpon prey, this was one, to teach them, they should not prey one vpon another, they should not take away one anothers goods, and feede themselues by offending him, who feedeth all: This is also the marke at which this Commandement doth leuell: which forbiddeth vs to haue vncs vngues, to be light fingered, to in∣crease that which is not our owne, by putting our hands to our neighbours goods; and secondly, inioyneth vs to content our selues with our owne estate, to get our owne liuing with our sweat, and as much as we may, to procure the good and the welfare one of another. Two sorts of men liue vpon prey, the first more publike, and these are they, which prey vpon Church or common wealth: vpon the Church, these are either grubbing Patrons of benefices, and their sacrilegious brokers, who robbe the Clarke whom they intend to present, or else greedy Parisho∣ners, who spoiling the Lord in Tithes and offerings, rubbe the Clarke presented: the first of these resembles the horse∣leach, Pro. 30 15 which cryes, giue, giue, resembles Iudas, who saith, Mat. 26. 15. what will yee giue, resembles the diuell, who saith, Mat. 4. 9 all these will I giue, if: and before matters be concluded Magus must offer money, the purse must pay for it, or else the wings of the benefice must be clipped: Tithes must be compounded for, or else abated, the palmer worme must haue his part, the grashopper his part, the canker worme his part, the cater∣piller
her part, and all that remaine shall be but Reliquiae Dana∣um at{que} immitis Achyllis; and the quotum shall consist in a great number of small Tithes: the Clarke shall haue a Camels skin stuft with straw: a great Canon that giues a monstrous cracke and shootes but paper, with Ixion he must imbrace a cloud for Inno, and with Narcissus make much of a shadow in stead of a water Nimph: he shall haue the shell when Ichnewmon hath suckt out the egge of the Crocodill, or the shelles of the Oyster, when the Latron hath had the flesh of the fish: small matters like the skabbard shall remaine vntoucht, when thunder hath destroyed the sword. The Statute of Mortmaine prouided they should giue no more to the Church, and therefore like Moses it cried Hoe, but tempora mutantur, & nos mutantur in illi. These latter times haue seene the springs of bounty like Ior∣den turned backe, which heretofore did run fresh and fast into the Church. Our fathers fore-fathers put too much bloud into the Churches veines, succeeding ages for her good, that it might not dye of a plurisie; let it bloud in the swelling veine of her excesse, these times are so farre from stopping the issue, that they prick it still and suffer it to bleed to death. The Aegyptians dealt hardely with the Israelites, when they tooke away their straw, and so doe these Gipcies, which take away the corne, and allow nothing but straw: they are sicke of the dropsie, and a cup as big as a Church will scarse satisfie it; so they may bee golden Patrons, they care not though they present leaden or wooden Priests, they are content with Michaes Priests, so they may haue them for Michaes wages, they preferre euen light angels before An∣gels of light, and care not how little reckoning the Clarke bee, so they may sell their presentation at a great price, they doe not so much regard aram dominicam, as haram domesticans, these are not Papistae but Rapistae, Merchants broken into the Church, a great deale more intollerable, then those which Christ whipt out of the Temple: This sacriledge is theft in the highest degree, in reuenging whereof Act. 5. 3. Peter vseth his key, in mentioning whereof, Rom. 2. 2. Paul maketh it a match or ouermatch for idolatry, and indeed, if couetousnesse, bee
Idolatry, and theft the daughter of couetousnes, and sacriledge the eldest daughter of theft, then he that committeh sacriledge may be sayd an Idolater: besides he is a meanes of Idolatry in bringing in ignorance and superstition, and though there be great fault in the Clarke, for he should say, by the grace of God I am that I am, not by my smooth tongue, not by my great friends, not by my bribing purse, yet Sacriledge is a beame in respect of this mote, and though the beame and mote must both be cast out, yet Mat. 7. 5. first cast out the beame Mat. 2. 12. though sellers and buyers must both be cast out of the Temple, yet the sellers haue the first place: and therefore ye Patrons, be no longer Pyrats of the Church, neither mangle nor sell that liberall al∣lowance that is committed to your trurst, doe not vnder colour of taking away the superfluity, leaue to little for the necessitie of the Minister, be somewhat more friendly to the Church then the East winde to the fruits of the eath, doe not 1. Kin. 14. 17. with Reho∣boham giue her sheilds of brasse for her sheilds of golde, make her not a marke to shoote at, pull not still the forbidden fruite, despoyle not the Church which your fathers clothed, rob her not of her possessions and endowments, let not your Leuits pur∣chase your Cures, let him haue his penny that labours in the Vineyarde, the false prophets made a spoyle of you, doe not you make a spoyle of the true, if you are merchants of soules, you are enemies of religion, you consume the zeale of Gods house, and are harbingers to take vp Chambers for the diuell. Againe the Parishoners which with-hold their tithe are sayd to robbe or spoyle Mal. 3. 8. 10. the Lord in tithes and offrings: God as he will haue the seuenth of your time, so he will haue the tenth of your liuing, Moses giues a strict charge for this in the Old Testament, and Gal. 6. 6. Paul as strict in the New: The Minister is borne for the good of many, and many for the good of him to Minister to him temporall things, as hee to them spiritu∣all, and therefore doe not yee like Caterpillers cleaue to the fruites of the Church, say truely with the Pharisee Luc. 18. 12 I giue tithe of all that euer I possesse, and giue it with a wil∣ling minde. Others like greedy cormorants and fawcons seaze, and plume and prey vpon the common wealth, such are they who
make a priuate gaine of that which should be for the publike good, such as depopulating Parishes thinke themselues ill seated, when they dwell by neighbours, such as grating vpon poore trades with hard ingrossing, to get much wealth, put in hazard all their credit and estimation: euen Tully a heathen Phi∣losopher, in his third booke of offices, thought this pulling, this catching and snatching from other did ouerthrow common societie, and that the whole body must then needes be weake and perish, when euery part thereof did thinke it might be strong, if it had conueyed to it selfe the strength of the next liues, but let this suffice to haue spoken of publike theft, either in spoyling Church or common wealth: there is a more priuate theft, when a man is a theefe to himselfe, or to his neighbour or to both, to himselfe, either to his body or his goods, to his body, when he doth not minister to it thigs necessary, but will be alwaies indebted to his backe and to his belly, and so as he may haue his purse full, he cares not though he keepe his backe bare and belly thinne, and cares not how poore he liue, so as he may dye rich. The good man hauing nothing is Lord of all things, l habet mina, quia habet habentem omina, he hath all2. Cor. 6. 10. things because he hath the Lord of all things, the father the most ancient of dayes filleth his memory, the sonne the wis∣dome of the father filleth his vnderstanding, the holy Ghost the comforter filleth his will: on the other side the miserable man hath all things, yet of all he hath, he hath nothing, he is good to none but worst to himselfe: he is like the Cornish-chough, which will steale a peece of money and hiding it in some hole, will neuer helpe her selfe with it afterward, vnlike the deluer of the earth, for he with his matocke drawes reliefe and nouriture out of the earth, but this man hides that in the earth, which should be a meanes  nourish and relieue him, if he wants any thing his spirit is troubled with restles thoughts to get it, if he hath any thing, he comforts not himselfe with it, but accompts it lost that he bestowes vpon himselfe, he is afraid hee should hinder himselfe of a chicke, if he should but eate an egge, and thinkes himselfe halfe vndone, if he makes a good meale on his owne trencher: this is an euill, which Salomon saw vnder the sun and it is much among men: m A man to whom God hath giuenM. Eec. 6. 1 riches and treasure and honour, and he wanteth nothing for his soule of
all that it desireth, but God giueth him not power to eate thereof: the body is a seruant, let it feele the sweet of it sweat, let it haue which is sufficient for quantitie, and wholsome for qualitie. let a Ecc. 2. 24 & 3. 22. man eate and drinke and delight his soule with the profit of his labour, and know that there is nothing better then that a man should reioyce in his affaires, Againe a man may be a theefe to himselfe in his estate, either when he shall foolishly hazard his goods for others, as in rash and vnaduised suerty ship, or else when he shall prodigally waste them vpon himselfe vpon backe, belly, or building, these three b b b; like the daughters of the Horse leach sucke out the very bloud of many a mans substan: The Prophet Hosee speaking of the destruction, that the Assyrans and Babilonians, should bring vpon Israell, saith Hos. 7. 9. strangers deuour their strength: so still strangers deuour mens strength: strange apparell, strange dyet, and strange building impayre many particular mens estates, and take their puses from them: strange apparell, when a mans attire shall be more worth then himselfe, and change of garments shall couer a thred-bare purse: strange dyet, when frugality is not the purse-bearer and hunger the cooke which assignes the dyet, when men haue veluet mouthes and sweet teeth, which must be furred with excesse of meate and drinke, when making their senses their purueyours, and appetite their stewards, they draw their goods thorough their throates. whose purses may be sayd poore for the great going out, while their bellyes may be sayd rich for the great comming in: strange building pickes a mans purse making some like the builder in the Gospell, who began to build, but was not able to make an end, others to leaue their houses desolate, for they spew out the owner, so that they are like the slothfull mans Vineyard: Pro. 24 3. 1 the nettle possesses the pleasant places of their siluer, the thorne is in their Tabernacles, and grasse groweth at the doores, or if they be re∣sident on their houses, they keepe but few fires in many chimneyes, the smoake comes all out at one hole, and though a man may see them a farre of, yet they cannot smell them nigh hand, bread and beefe is turned into stones: the stately rofe, the costly parements, the curious workemanship, hath chased away hospitaliie, robbed the purse, and brought it into a con∣sumption not to be recouered.
Of those which put their hands to their neighbours goods, some are notorious theeues, as on Shooters hill or in Stangate hole, which take vp such purses as fall in the laps for want of suffici∣ent defense, some whereof are like the Owle, which preyes in the darke, who turning the order of Nature vpside downe, watch the night and sleepe the day, others like the Kite prey in the light both sorts watch for a man: and as fowlers take birdes, so are they Hos. 6. 9. a snare on Mizpha, and a not spred vpon Tabor: God to shew that he would not haue any man spoyled of that which was his, tooke order that the wife should not marry to a stranger, if her first husband dyed childles: that if a man had builded an house, Deu. 20. 5 planted a Vineyard, betrothed a wife, he should not goe to warre, till he first had had the vse of them all: that the father when he dyed, should not giue to one sonne, that which of right belongeth to another: he should not giue away the inheritance from the first borne, though happe∣ly he bare more affection to one of his younger sonnes, except6. 7. he had iust cause to doe it: as Iacob had, who therefore set his eldest sonne Deu. 21. 6 Ruben besides the cushion, because he went vp to his fathers bed to defile, it if God would not suffer the father to dispose of that which was his owne, much lesse will he haue on mans goods to be at anothers disposition: and therefore when Gen. 49. a prigging fellow sayd to Demosthenes (who tooke him vp short for fingring that which was none of his own) nescieba quod h tuum esset: I did not thinke it had been yours: Demosthenes well replyed, at tuum non esse satis sciebas, but thou knewest well enough it was none of thine, & therfore hand off, thou shouldest let it alone: neither let any say, God commanded the Israelites to rob the Aegyptians, for Gods commadement against his lawe is no warrant for any to breake the lawe. Besides the com∣mon Gailebirds which are limefingred, and spoyle them that passe by peaceably, as though they returned from the warre, there are others which rob men priuily and more closely in∣crease that which is not theirs: I will not speake here of the Lawyer, who is little better then a theefe, if his hand be open to receiue a fee, and his mouth be shut, when he should speake in his Clyents cause, nor yet of the Phisition, who is little better then a theefe, if of purpose hee keepes his Patient low, that he may be still in request nor of the Minister, who if he
enters not in by the oore into the sheepe-fold, if he takes the  and feeds not the flocke, is a theefe and a robber: I come to those, who though they haue no calling, can make an oc∣cuption of close theft, either in taking from other that which they haue, or keeping backe that which they should haue: in the first ranke is the vsurer, who breeding money of money, to the third and fourth generation proues like the butlers boxe, which at last drawes all the counters to it. The Ca∣non law makes this man a theefe, and therefore doth not one∣ly excommunicate him, detaine him from the Sacraments, de∣ny him buriall, but makes his will, no will, as though his goods were not his owne: and therefore when an vsurer asked a prodigall man, when hee would leaue spending; I will then, saith he, leaue wasting that, which is mine owne, when thou doest giue off stealing from others. Saint Luke makes this man worse then other sinners, when hee saith, Luc. 6. 3 Sin∣ners lende to sinners to receiue the like: but these to receiue more. The ancient law of the Romames makes him worse then other theeues, therefore whereas it enioyned theeues to r∣store double, the vsuer should restore fourefold. The He∣brewes make him a biting theefe, who gnaweth the debter to the very bones, yea the most roothles vsury hath sharpe gummes, which bite as sore as an old dogge, or an hungry flie, and vnder shew of licking whole suckes out the heart bloud, and therefore when on a time the bill and bondes of vserers (for these men turne their estate into obli∣gations) were at Athens all heaped together in the market place, and burnt before their faces, Alcibiades laughing, said, he neuer saw a clearer or purer fire. There is a spiritu∣allb Mat. 25. vsury, God deliuers his talents hee lets out his gifts and lookes for increase, and we must pay it, he is nuer needy yet delighteth to gaine, neur couetous yet he demandeth vsu∣ry: and Bornardine thought a man might let his money to vse without offerce, but it was when he let it out to such, as were neuer able to returne the principall, as for other vsurers, one saith, they are the very vermine of the earth, whom God ne∣uer made, but when the floud ceased, they rose vp a other vrmine of the slme of the earth, and euer since held by in∣trusion.
But what saith the vsurer? the law of the land will allow ten of the hundred: therefore you doe not well to inueigh a∣gainst it: first concerning the argument, the law of the Lord, not of the lande, must be the square of our liues, else are wee like the Iewes, who when they would crucifie Christ, said, Ioh. 19. 7 Wee haue a law, and by our law hee ought to die: Now concerning the Proposition, the law is wronged, for it alloweth not ten for lone of an hundred, but punisheth him which extorteth more, neither shal a man by law recouer ten, if he put it in suite but forfet his principall, if he compound for more then ten. Another saith: I may let or lend other things, and take rent, or haue for the lone, and why not for my money? the reason is not alike: for other things are the worse for wearing, not the money, as good current money must bee returned as was let out: Againe though a man let out other things, yet is he Lord of them still, so is not the of his money, after that he hath parted with it: againe other things yeeld a commodity of their owne nature, so doth not money, the labour and tra∣uaile of him which borrowes it, brings in all the profit; Lastly, if a man let other things, the borrower doth not beare the losse if they miscarry, except it be by his default, as for example, the sea makes a rupture into a peece of ground, the lessor, who owes the ground shall beare the losse, the lessee who rents the ground shall not be constrained to it. A man lets a Horse, which falleth sicke and dieth, if the owner knowes there was no fault in the borrower, the borrower Ex. 22. 15 shal not make it good for it was an hired thing, and went for his hire, but let mo∣ney miscarry any way: he that lends it will looke it should be repaide. An other saith, it is lawfull to giue vse, ergo to take it: rhis Argument is as weake as the rest: A true man may deliuer his purse, as many times he doth to saue his life, or preuent a fur∣ther mischiefe, this doth not proue it lawfull for a theefe to de∣mande or to take his purse. A man may suffer wrong, is it therefore lawfull to doe wrong? Saint Paul commands the 1 Cor. 6. 7 8. one, and condemnes the other: doe not therefore let money, sell not time for price, make not a gaine of vncharitable cha∣rity free not a man from one band and wrappe him in many;
1. be not worse then a Iew, one Iew will not take vse of another; be not like b Iosephs brethren, who comforted theird Gen. 37. 35. father, yet caused his woe, nor the Iuy, which killeth by culling, nor the Aspe, which with his sting casteth a man in∣to a pleasant sweet sleepe, but disperseth his venemous infe∣ction into euery member of the body to the losse of life: bee not a legall theefe, doe not breede money of money, assoone as it hath any being, set it not to beget more, like the hare, which while shee brings vp one, bringes forth an other, and conceiueth an other young after her first conception, lay not this heauy burden vpon thy brethren, much lesse looke for a secret gratuity besides the maine interest: vsury is a trade too easie to be honest, the bane of charity, and very death of life, and therefore as other Nations did punish this sinne, some with Zachees restitution, as the Romaines, some with banish∣ment as the Lacedemonians, some with burning bands, as the Athenians so God mentioning the cruelty of Ierusalem, in ta∣kinge Ez. 22. 12 13. vsury and the increase, like a man in a rage imites his hands together, that they may be sure, hee will bee auenged of it. There are other Takers which Iob ranketh among theeues, and of these he sets those in the forewarde, which take away a mans land, not onely such as doe this vnder colour of law, as  Ki. 21. 16 Ahab tooke away Naboths vineyard, but such as by displa∣cing boundes, incroach one vpon anothers ground: ome, saith he, Iob 24. 2. remoue the landmarkes, that rob the flockes and feede thereof: God who set bounds to the Sea appointed boundes betwixt land and land: what a care God had of vpright dea∣ling, herein we see by the curse vpon them, which would set in or out the bounde at their pleasure, f Cursed bee hee that re∣moueth his neighbours marke: what a care man had hereof, we seeg Deu. 27. 17. by the lawes and constitutions made for this purpose; for not onely the Canon law taketh order for perambulations, but there is a writ in England de perambulatione facienda. Euen among the heathen there was an Idoll or god Terminus, whom they supposed to haue the preeminence ouer boundes of lands, to him they dedicated a Temple, which alwaies had a hole in the roofe, to shew the bounds of land should not bee couered or hid, and besides this, they were wont, as Siculus Flaccus
saith, to put vnder bounds either ashes or coales, or potsheards or broken glasses, or burnt bones or lime or plaister; and there∣fore Mr. Cambden in his Britannia is of this minde, that a cer∣taine little hill or barrow neere Lilborre in Northhamptonshire, was some bound, for that when men digged into it, vpon a con∣ceit to finde great riches, in stead of gold they found coales, & exijt ridiculus mus, and he is rather induced to be of this opi∣nion, for that Saint Augustine writing of coales saith: Nonne miranda res est, &c. is it not a strange thing that coales, which are so weake, that they are broken with the least stroake, and crushed in peeces, if you doe but treade vpon them, should nothwithstanding neuer be worne out in any age, which was the cause that they which set vp bounds, were wont to put coa∣les vnder them, for if a troublesome fellow, saith Saint Augu∣stine, should rise vp in succeeding ages, and standing in conten∣tion should say, that the bound set vp, were not the true bound, he might be conuinced hereby, when by digging they found coales vnder it: that we run not into this fault, we must remember the Prouerbes, Feede within thy teather, cut within thy leather. There are others who breake this Commandement by ta∣king pledges when cruell couetous misers will take for pled∣ges those things, with which poore men get their liuing, or which they cannot lacke without danger of life and health: the first of these Iob laieth to the charge of the wicked, Deu. 24. 6 17. they lead a∣way the Asse of the fatherlesse, and take the widowes Oxe to pledge: with the latter Elyphaz, though most vntruely, chargethIob 24. 3. Iob himselfe, Thou hast taken the pledge from thy brother forIob. 31. 19 20. naught, and spoyled the cloathes of the naked: this was one of theIob 22. 6. transgressions of Israel, for which God would not turne to it: Amos 2. they lay downe vpon cloathes laid to pledge by euery Altar: First they take any thing, not hauing respect to the neces∣sity of the party that parteth from it, whereas by the lawn Deu. 24 10. 11. they should stay the deliuerance, and take that which might best be spared: Secondly Ex. 22. 26 they lay downe vpon it: and so keepe it longer then the law will allow: Thirdly, they vse it as their owne, and that publikely, euen in their solemne Feasts: this is a kinde of theft, of which this Commandement doth make restraint.
Others breake this lawe by taking and making vnlawfull gaine in bargaining: as the buyer, when to haue a thing vnder value, will say, Pro. 20. 14. it is naught, it is naught but when he cōmeth home, be praiseth his penny worth: the seller, when to fetch the buyer off, will lade him with deepe and vnseasonable prices, when he will make him pay deere for dayes, when hee will conceale the fault of that he selleth, when with faire wordes, false measures, light weights, forsworne valuations, adulterate wares he shall empty his purse to fill vp his owne: to auoide this fault we must vse that simplicitie and plainenes in buying and selling which was betweene Gen. 23. 15. 16. Ephron and Abraham: for the one in few words tells the true value what the thing is worth, and the other, letting passe the vaine wordes and idle othes, which commonly passe betweene vs in the like ex∣changes, presently tenders the money. This is another kinde of theft when a man shall keepe hacke that which of right belongeth to another, as when he shall deny vnto his Leu. 6. 2. 3. neighbour that which was taken him to keepe, or that which was put to him of trust, or that which he hath found, or that which is strayed into his ground or that which he hath gained by false reckoning, or that which is worse, when hee shall keepe backe the wages of his hyred seruant, for this is one of the foure sinnes which cry to God for vengeance. Clamitat in calum Gen. 4. 10 vox sanguinis, Gen. 18. 21. et Sodemorum, Ex. 2 23. Vox oppressorum: Ia. 5,  merces retenta laborum. And it is worth the obseruation, that God is neuer called the Lord of Hostes in the New Testament, but when Saint Iawes makes metion of this sinne, to shew that, though hee may winke at many other sinnes, yet to be avenged of this, hee will awake as a man out of sleepe and as a Gyant refreshed with Wine. I will not speake here of bad Exequu∣tors, which keepe backe the right from poore Orphants, which neuer knew the price of their father, who (when they should be∣come the heyres of the fathers affection, and the burden of his cares, when they should bring vp his children in instruction and information of the Lord, and deliuer them their portions in due season) neuer regard with what licour they season them: like Vultures they prey vpon the dead, and as the Phanix rise on others ashes: these and the like thefts, though they
may be comitted closely, and the world takes not like notice of these den theeues▪ as it doth of those which as wilde Asses in the Wildernes goe forth to their busines & rise early for a prey; yet God will reproue them, & set before them the things which they haue done: God & a good conscience detesteth close euils: Moses and the Craftsmen might haue made a priuie gaine of such offrings as the people would haue brought for the Taber∣nacle, but this they thought no good and honest course, and therefore, when they saw that the people offered themselues willingly and their hands had ministred enough, and more then enough, they sayd not still, as those rulers in Hosee Hos. 4. bring yee: nor cryed as the daughters of the Horseleach▪ in the Prouerbs Pro. 30. 15. 16. giue giue: they were not like the graue, the barren wombe, the earth & the fire which neuer say, it is enough though they might closely haue licked their owne fingers with the ouerplus but on the contrary side, they cryed Ex. 36. 6. Hoe, and caused pro∣clamation to be made, that neither man nor woman should prepare any more worke for the oblation of the sanctuary: so the people were stayed from offering: they sayd in effect, as the Lord to the Angell in another case 2. Sam. 24 16. it is sufficient, hold now thy hand: and now I hold my tongue from further speach of this vice, and come to those who are both theeues to themselues & to others, and these are the idle loyterer and common gamster. The loy∣terer saith Pro 6. 10. a little sleepe, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleepe: in the shortest dayes he will haue the Sun witnes of his rysing, louing to keepe his bed warme, not so much for will to sleepe, as vnwillingnes to dresse himselfe, but Salomon telles his fortune k the sleeper shall be cloathed with ragges: by doing no∣thing, he brings himselfe to nothing: thus is he a theefe to his owne estate, who getteh naught, as much as the spendall who wasteth all: In like manner he doth rob others while hee liues by the sweet of others sweat: this would Paul insinuate when he would haue those which worke 2. Tim. 3. 12. not at all, to worke with quietnes and eate their owne bread: as if he should say, they which worke not, eate not their owne bread, but eate vp other mens stoare, as the Drones the Bees hony, Gen. 42. 7. and the seuen thinne eares, the seuen full eares of corne, let euery one therefore walke diligent∣ly in the vocation whereunto he is called: euery one must be a factor, occupie till I come, man is borne vnto labour, therefore
nulladies sinelinea: let the trades-man keepe his shop, the seaman his ship, let the dresser of the Vineyard say I will digge about it, let the shepheard follow the Ewes great with young, let the husbandman sweat his browes, the scholler his braines, let euery one goe forth vnto his labour vntill the euening and if necessitie compell, encroach vpon the night for time, let la∣bour and sweat, hunger and thirst be spices to season and relish our meates: if we be dumbe shewes on Gods stage, false lights in his house, blankes in his Kalender, cyphers in his Arithme∣ticke, mutes in his Grammer, idle in his Vineyard, if worke be the greatest torment we can dreame off, we rob our selues we rob others, and doe as much loose the cordes of the com∣mon-wealth as they which take payne, raise vp the pillers of it: if we will take rest or recreate our selues, we must as well mea∣sure our case as our payne: Christ permitteth his Disciples to ease themselues, but limiteth the permission Mar. 6. 35 Rest a∣while. The common gamster is also a bird of this feather, and there∣fore Salomon reading his desteny saith, Pro. 21. 17 he that loueth pastime shall be a poore man: a sweet tooth and veluet mouth make some begger-bare: disease or pennery is the best end of aduletrers, and a gamesome hand doth assoone impouerish a man, as a lickerous tongue or a wanton eye, but some will say they picke out a prety liuing by play, indeed they cannot vse a fitter tearme, for now they picke and prey vpon others, but let them cast their accompt and in the end they shall finde, that they put their winnings into a broken bagge, and may say of such gettings as Nabucadnezzar did of his dreame. I had a dreame, but Dan. 2. 8 the thing is gone from me, and of all goods they which are thus gotten may be sayd moueable, for that they are like the cloudes which fall as they climbed, and therefore make not an occupation of play and pastime, God in the beginning did not make man for disport, who would haue him worke in his Paradise, and when men were multiplied vpon the earth, he neuer sayd, feast and play, but fast and pray, and though thou maiest sometime recreate thy selfe, (for a bow to much bended may breake) yet make not an habit, no not of generous delights, much lesse of base disports: make not an habit of Card-play: make not a habit of Dice-play, thou shalt picke
thine owne or anothers purse, thou shalt hurt thy conscience, lose thy time, looke ou pale with feare to lose, or be ouer∣hot with desire to win, thou shalt fret and fume, disquiet thy selfe, make thy heart shake within thee, and rage as if thou wet bit with a madde dogge, and therefore if thou hast been to much addicted to this vanitie, leaue off, and know for a surety that the best cast at Dice is to cast them quite a∣way. I speake not here of a greedy desire of other mens goods which the Scripture comprehendeth vnder theft, and there∣fore though Iudas did not steale yet because he would haue had the price of the oyntment come o his bagge, he is accompted Ioh. 12. 6 noe better then a theefe, and therefore let euery man cleanse himselfe of this sinne, and drawe gold out of the heart, as cunning Alcumists drawe it out of the earth, and now I drawe to an end of the prohibition, and come to the iniunction which is the second streame that issueth from this fountaine, and a bough into which this law doth branch it selfe. The first vertue therefore which this Commandement re∣quireth is contentation: we must learne with Paul in what estate soeuer we are therewith to be content, if wee susteyne want, we must not by vnlawfull meanes seeke to enrich our selues, but beare pouertie with patience: A rich man which looseth that he hath is not so happy, as he that hath nothing to loose: againe, the blessings that pouertie brings, ouermatch the euils and discommocities that come with it: say a poore mans fare is homely, yet it is wholesome, and better relished to him then dainties to the rich, because it is sawced with hunger which is a better spice then the other hath, optimum cibs condimentum fames and an Onyon pleaseth him better then an Oliue, say his loging is not soft, yet his sleepe is sound, say his apparell be plaine, yet it keepeth out colde, say he labours and takes pay n. yet his life is quiet, his mirth is free, hee is witkout feare, without care, without suspition: say he drinkes no Wine not strong drinke, now he is not troubled with the Gowte, say he doth not barrell vp in his belly that variety of Gods creatures which other de, now he doth not urfet with excesse: we are here trauailers to the spirituall Canaan Gen. 28. 20. and with Iacob must be content, if God giue vs bread to cate, and
cloathes to put on. We are here as on a sea, and must be con∣tent, if we haue but water enough to carry the shippe: Why should we desire other mens goods, and seeke to get them by hooke and by crooke, seeing we shall carry with vs at last no∣thing but our winding sheete; why should we encroach vpon other mens land, and seeke quouis iure, quauis iniuria, to ioyne land to land, since at last we shall haue but each of vs seuen foote of earth? God hath cast euery mans lot, if the lot doth not fall to one in so good a ground, as it doth vnto another, or in so plentifull manner, yet seeke not to better it by entring vpon another mans right, but be content with the portion which is allotted, for as the greatest euils are beneath our sinnes, so the least fauours are aboue our deserts. The second vertue required is restitution: The best thing is to doe no man wrong, and the second best is, to make him amends: and therefore the law required restitution of stolen goods, whither a man had stolen Ex. 22. 1. either great beasts of the hearde, or small beasts of the flocke, neither did it onely compell him to make restitution, which had robbed another, Ex. 22. 5. but him also which had any way damnified his neighbour, and not him onely which had damnified another, but him al∣so,r Ex. 21. 33 which had any way been a cause of his impouerishing: and if you will haue all; take nine together in these two old verses, Iussio, consilium, consensus, palpo, recursus: Participans, mutus, non obstans, non manifestans. A good man cannot take taste in goods wrongfully got∣ten, it takes away the contentment of the thing, to thinke when, and by what meanes he came to it, and though Gen. 43. 21 Ia∣cobs sonnes were not faulty this way, yet they could not bee quiet, till they had carried backe the money, which they found in their sackes mouthes: therefore Gen. 12. 9 Pharaoh restoreth Abra∣ham his wife, therefore Luc. 19. 8 Zachee righteth those, whom he had wronged, and repaieth them with the vsury, which he him∣selfe would not take. Diseases of the body are healed by contraries, so are the soares of the minde, couetousnesse by liberality, whoredome by chastity, oppression by restitution, this is as the Prophet speaketh anDan. 4. 24 healing of the errour, neither is there any other way
to cure it according to that saying: Non tollitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum. Wrong offered is an impostume, contritum pricks it, confes∣sum lets out the filth, restitution laieth on the plaister, this is vnica tabula post naufragium, the onely board whereby with Act. 27. 44 Pauls company wee escape shipwracke: this is that which Theodorie told a Baily of his, who like the Luc. 16. 6 vniust Steward had made an vnlawfull gaine of his masters goods: A serpent, saith he, finding a viole full of wine, went in at the mouth of the glasse, and suckt it vp, and now being all belly and stuft like a Tun he could not get out: the owner of the glasse com∣ming, and seeing what was done, thus he saith, miser, euome quod hausists, &c. thou art now in a pitifull case, the way to get out and saue thy selfe is, to cast vp which thou hast suckt vp, and therefore as the chaines did fall from Peters hands, and then hea Act. 12. 7. came out of prison: so let the chaines of couetousnesse with which our hands and hearts are bound fast fall from vs, then shall we make free restitution: But as euery one is not a good archer, which can draw a strong bow, which hath a faire loose, which can shoote farre, for all this a man may doe, and yet not shoot neere the marke, so a mans hands may restore his sub∣stance, yet his hands may misse the marke, and his good deed be like a good tale marred in the telling, and therefore as Paul takes the Christian before his race and giues him this watch∣word,q 1 Cor. 9. 24. so runne: so that this good deed may be well done, that a man may doe iustum iuste, let me tell him to whom, and when he must restore. Some restore ill gotten goods, but as though they had mi∣staken the party, they rappe at the wrong doore: Iudas when Mat. 26. 48. he had wronged Christ did not make him amends, but resto∣res the mony to the Temple, some vtterly spoile and vndoe their neighbours, by vsury, by extortion, by racking of rents, by inclosing of commons, and then with the superfluity of their sinne, they will build an Almes-house, and if they haue spoiled many and made them beggers, now they will keepe some, & relieue them with the plaisters of their bounty: but as if one wrong vs, we do not seeke to right our selues vpon ano∣ther, for then we take the wrong sowe by the eare, and are much like the foole, which smites his next fellow, so if wee
wrong any, we must right the party wronged, else we rob Peter and pay Paul: Iustice goeth before mercy, and as iustice giuesd Mi. 6. 8. of it owne, so it giues euery one his owne, it giues it (accordinge Leu. 6. 5. the Commandement) vnto him to whom it pertaineth. Others will make restitution, but they will linger like Lot,f Gē. 19 16 they will doe it in their last will and testament. I knew a man, who among other legacies gaue two thousand pounds to sa∣tisfie those, which could make any iust proof that he had wrong∣ed them, better late then neuer, but better soone then thus late, gratia, quae tarda est, ingrata est gratia, restitution after death is lead, in sicknes is siluer, but in health is gold, and therefore with Zachee make present pay, in this case let our owne handsg Luc. 19. 8 be our exequutors, and before we die, let vs see this wil proued before our face, propotioning our restitution at least, accor∣ding to the wrong we offered, else are we deceitfull vpon the ballance, and false balances are an abomination vnto the Lord, but a perfit weight pleaseth him. Herein we must obserue the measure of tantum quantum, and obseruing the times toties quoties, deli∣uer a tot quot: and as Peter Pro. 11. 1 Mar. 14 68. who denied thrice, Io. 21. 15 confesseth thrice as Paul Act. 26. 11 who persecuted more then they all, 1 Cor. 15 10. laboured more then they all, and as  Cro. 33. 12. Manasses made the prison of Babi∣lon run with teares, 2 K. 21. 16 who had caused the streets in Ierusalem to flow with bloud, Luc. 7. 38 as Mary who sinned much wept much, so they which haue robbed often, must restore often, and they which haue done much wrong, must make much satisfaction; this is the reuenge of a Christian, which a Sain Paul speakethh 2 Co. 7. 11 of, this is according to Iohn Baptists counsell, to bring forth fruitesb Mat 3. 8. worthy amendement of life; this is as Daniel speaketh, to breake ofc D 2 24 our sinnes by righteousnes; this is not to goe the same way weee Mat 2. 12 came (according to the  13 9 charge giuen to the man of God) but with the wise Men to returne into our Countrey another way.
The ninth Commandement. Exod. 20. 16. Thou shalt not beare false witnes against thy neighbour. THe Philosopher said, that man is  a little world in the great, and the holy Ghost saith, that the tongue is a great world in the little: Ia. 3. 6. A world of wickednes, an vnruly euill, full of deadly poison to go∣uerne this world, and to rule this vnruly euill, as nature hath fenced it in with a double barre, so the law hath made for it a bitte and a bridle, by setting downe a double re∣straint: A bitte, thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in∣uaine: therefore let not thy tongue rent and teare God in pee∣ces, or cast vp choler against his Maiesty: A bridle in this place, Thoushalt not beare false witnes against thy neighbour: there∣fore sit not & speake against thy brother, poysen him not with the venemous sting of thy tongue, whet not thy tongue like a sword, nor shoote for thy ar owes bitter words. Thou shalt not beare, &c. As Abraham sinned both by his speach, and by his silence, and therefore Pharaoh expostulating the matter with him, blames him for both, for his speach, Gen. 12. 18. 19. why saidest thou (speaking of Sarah thy wife) shee is my sister: for his silence, wherefore diddest thou not tell mee, that shee was thy wife? so doe men transgresse this law, both by speach and by silence: by speach publikely or priuately, publikely when in open assem∣blies, or at Iudgement seates a child of Beliall shall come forth, and giue false euidence, an vnconscionable Counsellor shall plead and further a bad case, a Iury shall passe a wrong verdict. The giuer in of false euidence, because he cuts the throate of all good proceedings, and is the beginner and first cause of turning Iustice topsie turuy, worthily deserueth the first place. This man slaieth as much with his tongue, as the bloud∣sucker with his sword, and therefore the holy Ghost couples hem together in the Prohibition, Thou shalt keepe thee farre from
a false matter, and Ex. 23. 7 shalt not slay the innocent and the righteous: The two wicked men that witnessed against Naboth in the presence ofi Kin 21. 13 the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the King, they were the men that cast him, for vpon their false accusation hee was stoned to death. God to restraine this sinne would haue those to execute the punishment, which did bring the accusation, for many mens tongues are a two dged sword, and some will wound him with their words, whom they dare not touch with their fingers, and therefore if any did accuse any man of such or such a crime, the law did bid them take heed what they did, for if their tongues did cast any man, their hands should execute the punishment: If they cahrged any man with Idola∣try, because the Idolater must be put to death, Deu. 17. 7 their hands shall be first vpon him to kill him, and then the hands of all the people:l Ioh 8. 7. If they accused any of adultery, they like the accusers in • the Gospell, should throw the first stone. 2. The punishment which the law of God inflicted on this sinne, is sufficient to restraine it, for hee which did falsely ac∣cuse another of any crime, should indure the punishment,m Deu. 19. 19. which the other should haue incurred, if hee had been found guilty, as if hee accused any of adultery, if the party accu∣sed could bee proued cleere, the accuser (because adultery was death by the law) should dye himselfe, which iudge∣ment wee see executed vpon the two Elders in the Story of Susanna; God will not suffer this sinne to goe vnpunished, and therefore, though Haman, who oppressed the innocentn Est 3. 8. . Iewes with false accusations and lies, that they might bee rooted out and destroied, was not for those vniust and slan∣derous speaches put to death, yet was hee oppressed him∣selfe and falsely accused of a fact which deserueth the Gib∣bet: for his intent was not to force the Queene, when hee fell downe at her beds feet or couch whereon shee sate, but to make supplication for his life, when he saw the mischiefe was towards him, howbeit the King taking and making the matter worse then hee meant it, will hee (saith the King) Est. 7. 8. force the Queene also before mee in the house? marry hange him: so they couered Hamans face and hanged him on the tree, that he had prae∣pared for Mordecai.
3 Whereas a man may deale against his neighbour two manner of wayes, either by way of denuntiation and telling him of his fault and in this case one man is sufficient, Mat. 18. 15. 16. if thy bro∣ther trespasse against thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him: or else by way of accusation, and in this case there must be two at the least, neither should one Deu 17. 6 witnes be sufficient to con∣demne a man, or rise against Deu. 19. 15. him for any trespasse or for any sinne, or for any fult he offended in, but two or three should concurre together, tha euery one might be circumspect what testimo∣ny he gaue, least any one should be found a false witnes, if, as at the passion of Christ, the witnesses agreed not together: let not therefore thē which are produced as witnesses in any kinde of trialls, by periury sinne against God in dispising his pre∣sence, sinne against man by taking away his life, his goods, or good name, sinne against the Iury, by leading them into by pathes out of the Kings high way, nor sinne against the Iudge in deluding him with falsehood and lyes, but without hope of gaine or feare of punishment, without fauour on the right hand, or malice on the left hand, let euery one speake the truth from his heart: sell not the truth like Iudas, deride not the truth, like the theefe on the left hand, testifie not against it, as the Iewes at the passion of Christ, neither conceale it, as did the keepers of the Sepulcher being corrupted with money, but speake the truth and nothing but the truth, refraining thy tongue from euill, and thy lippes that they speake noe guile. That Lawyer who pleades a bad cause, and knowes it to be a had cause, is the second person who runnes into the publicke breach of this Commandement, neither is there any great odes betwixt do∣ing of a wrong and maintaining it, and therefore the Scrip∣ture condemneth as well s him that shall put his hand with theEx. 23. 1. wicked, as him that shall giue a false report. The Lawyer should be a true glasse, and by him should iudge and Iury see the truth of the cause, as it is, but if with his smooth tongue and good vtterance he makes falsehood haue ore shew of truth then truth it selfe, hee is a Christall glasse, which howsoeuer il fauoured  man be will shew a faire face: I speake in the honour of good pleading, where by meere Nar∣rations, men vnfolde the equitie of the cause, when truth strip∣ping her selfe naked comes to the barre, this is a thing most
honorable, but false glasses and glosses varnishing and gar∣nishing, false bodyes and counterfeit colours are staynes and blemishes: I speake not against plausible speach, let men mar∣tiall their wordes the sooner to ouerthrow a badde cause and to win the truth, but let not a rotten cottage be well hanged: let a faire body haue a well fashioned garment, smooth thy selfe at Tullies glasse, speake not onely scripta, but sculpta, make not a good cause harh to the hearers by slubbering it vp in rude & careles wordes, but neuer set a good coate on a mishapen, body neuer garnish a ragged house with faire paintings, if the cause be bad, let not thy speach be full of florishes, like the first let∣ter of a Patent to better it, seeke not to leade Iudge or Iurors out of the way with a golden chayne, which comes from thy tongue to their eares, let thy eloquence, Rhethoricke and Art of perswading serue onely for Clyents of truth. Againe the Iurors publickely breake this law, when they being corrupted shall giue vp a false Verdict, when they doe not enquire diligently of the fact, and truely relate to the Iudges what they finde that they may doe Iustice and Iudgement, (Iudices n. apud no iuris solum, non facti sunt iudices, Iudges with vs doe not so much en∣quire of the fa whether such a thing were done, as set downe the law, what the fact deserueth, if it were done: to refraine this sinne, euen the law of our land doth punish it with great seueritie, for if but one Iurour in any inquest shall take money of one party or the other to giue his verdict, there lyes a Writ against him called Dcies tantum, and he shall pay ten times as much as he receiued, but if a false verdict giuen by twelue men be found, the 12. men be attaint & their iudgement shall. be this, their Medowes shall be ared vp, their houses broken downe, their Woods turned vp, and all their Lands and Te∣ements forfaited to the King. Lastly, Iudges they must heare and consider, and then after giue sentence because they represent Gods owne person: Be wise now therefore O yee Kinges, be learned yee that are Iudges of the earth, let your skill in discerning be answerable to your power in commanding: put on iustice let it couer you, let iudg∣ment be your robe and crowne▪ though the mater be knowne, yet let the party offending come to his answere that other may hear an feare, D. . 21. Ioshua examines Achan & will haue him con∣fesse that which he knoweth already, if the matter be doubt∣full,
commandement of God is, Deu. 13. 14. thou shalt seeke and make search, and enquire diligently: this was Iobs practise Iob. 29. 16. when I knew not the cause I sought it out diligently, God the Iudge of all the world would teach particular Iudges of seuerall circuits to prefer con∣sideration before conclusion, when he saith Gen. 18. 21. I will goe downe and see. In the law if a man were suspected to haue the Leprosie he should be sht Leu. 13. 4. vp seuen dayes, and the Priest shold view him againe and againe before he gaue iudgement, a lucky tra∣ueler sets not forth while it is yet darke, but stayes till the day Starre appeares Ecc. 18. 18. get thee righteousnes (saith the sonne of Sirach) before thou come to iudgement, learne before thou speake, giue not a certaine sentence in a doubtfull matter, Cor. 4. 5. iudge nothing before the time: before the time, either collatae potestatis or cognitae veritatis: say one man doth accuse yet the matter may be doubtfull, Ptiphar cannot be excused, who vpon the accusation of his wife cast Ioseph his true and faithfull seruant into prison▪ nor yet Assuerus, who decreed against the Iewes vpon the accusation of wicked Haman: say many doe accuse, yet thou shalt not Ex. 23. 2. a∣gree in a controuersie to decline after many and ouerthrow the truth Elihues anger was kindled against Iobs three friendes Iob 3. . 11. 12. Eliphaz Bildad and Zophar, because they could not finde an answere and yet condemned Iob: Behold saith he, I did waite vpon your wordes and harkened to your knowledge, whiles you sought out reasons, yea, when I had considered you, loe there ws none of you that reproued Iob nor answered his wordes. As Elihu is to be commended in this, that he heard all parties, as Kin. 3. 16. Salomon did the two harlots, and then blamed the accusers, who would condemne a man yet could not answere him, so Pilate is to be condemned, who did not oppose himselfe against the accusers of Christ, but to please the people condemned the innocent, for though he sought meanes to deliuer Christ, first by comparing him with Barrabas, secondly by delaying the sentence, thirdly by pronouncing him guiltles, what Ma. 15. 12. 14. euil hath he done yet because the high Priests ac∣cused him, the Elders did witnes many things against him, the people cryed out for iudgement, he forgot to put on righte∣ousnes on the right hand or on the left, in that against his owne conscience, he loosed the wicked and condemned the innocent. Sometime there is no euidence, yet many times the party but suspected is guiltie, in this case wise Salomon found out the truth by making shew of diuiding the liuing childe: I read of a
Iudge, who hauing sundry persons conuented before him, a∣mong whom it was well knowne, that one must needs be guil∣tie of a murder that was committed, and yet no sufficient proofe to conuince any one; laid his hand on euery ones heart, and at last found him guilty, whose heart did butte and pant more then the rest, for an accusing conscience did worke some distemper within him: I know this is no sufficient argu∣ment to condemne any man, except it be a meanes to wring from him his owne confession, yet is it as strong to argue a man guilty, as that in Tully, to proue the two young men guiltlesse of a murder committed in their chamber, because they were found quietly asleepe in the morning: Now as a man may be guilty, though there be no sufficient proofe to conuince him: so he may be guiltlesse, though euidence be brought a∣gainst him: false witnesses may rise vp, and lay to his charge things that he knowes not: and therefore let Iudges heare and consider, and giue sentence: let them try the spirits of accu∣sers, whither they be of God or no; happily they may be of the same spirit that Iames and Iohn were, who desired venge∣ance,Luc. 9. 54. Mat. 26. 59. and with the high Priests, may rather seeke to put a man to death, then desire to haue the truth knowne: let them be like the Grecians, who when they were vged to giue ouer∣hasty sentence, answered, Patres suos apud Antipodes solem non vidisse, sed semper expectasse donec & ipsis oriretur. Life is pre∣tious,1 Kin. 2. 18. &c. all that a man hath will he giue for his life, pull not men from it with violence, as Ioab from the hornes of the Altar: cut not off the limmes, except it bee well knowne they lacke bloud and life, as you would say, and also hurt other parts of the body. Againe, this Commandement is broken by speach priuat∣ly, when men either shall report the truth to a bad end, as those malicious flatterers, which come and accuse the Iewes of ingratitude and rebellion, or else report that which is false,Dan. 3.  either of themselues (when they shall too much magnifie themselues, and boast of those gifts they haue not, or on the other side too much vilifie themselues, and extenuate the gifts they haue) or of others, when they shall disgrace worth by
malice, or smoothe and grace vnworthinesse by flattery, ∣uour or affection: the Prophet Esay dislikes both sorts, as wellEsa. 5. 20. condemning those, which speake euill of good, as those which speake good of euill: the first sort which speake euill of good, are lyers and slaunderers, of which some robbe the renowne of the dead, other sacke the good name of the liuing: the first sort are like Hyenae that woluish beast, which vntombes the bodies of the dead, that he may feed himselfe with putrified flesh like the dogs, not the dogs which did like the sores of Lazarus to heale them, but the dogs which did eat Iezabel byLuc. 16. 21. 1 King. 9. 35. the walls of Israell, and like the Rauen who hauing found the dead carkasse doth rest vpon it, such a one gaue occasion of the prouerbe , because they are the scourge of the dead, while they delight to die their tongues in their bloud: on the one side therefore paint not the Sepulchre of the deceased with false colours, in giuing him that tribute which belongs not vnto him; make him not white as snow, that was as blacke as the blacke Horse in the Reuelation, as now and then a blackReu. 6. 5. prophet, will for a blacke gowne, on the other side, bury that with him which was blame-worthy, repeat it not either to blot the name of the dead, or disgrace his kindred he left be∣hinde him: much lesse make his good euill, by setting thy foot on his carkasse. Others sacke the good name of those which be aliue Ier. 9. 3. they bend their tongues like their bowes for lyes, Psal. 11. 2 Then they make ready their arrowes vpon the string Psa. 120. 3. euen mighty and sharpe arrowes, which will pierce like the quills of a Porcupine, these they shoot sometime against those that are present as Eliphaz doth against Iob: thus and thus thou hast done, Iob. 22. 6. Thou hast ta∣ken the pledge from thy brother for nought, and spoyled the clothes of the naked, &c. Sometime against the absent, as Hae∣man in his Oration against the Iewes, who lets his tongue run too much at liberty, that they might be rooted out to auoide this sinne; let the accuser with the wise Man, affirme no moreHs. 3. 8. then he knowes; with the good man, no more then standeth with charity, but if his tongue like the clacket of a Mill will still be wagging, if he doth what he can to grinde to
powder the good name of his neighbours; let the accused learne to make this vse of an enemie, so to liue, as no credit shall be giuen vnto him. They which make euill good, are either the inferiour sort which smooth vnworthinesse by flattery, whose tongs are wil∣ling slaues to other mens eares, and so as they may speak that which can please, much regard not how little truth is in their words: such were those parasites who did gather about Herod when he made an Oration, and as though nothing proceeded from him vnworthy of admiration Act. 12. 22. gaue a shoute, saying, the voice of God and not of man: There Math. 9. 23. were Minstrels about the dead maid, so let great men be dead in trespasses and sins, yet shal they haue Trumpetors to sound out their commendation: the very spots of Cato were beauty, and if any obiected drun∣kennesse vnto him, Citius efficeret crimen honestum, quam tur∣pm Catonem: to auoide this sinne, praise not euery action as good, nor the best too much, and in presence. As the meaner sort soothe & smoothe, and with Nephthali,Gen. 49. 21. giue goodly words, blessing with their mouthes those whom God accurseth, so the richer sort for fauour & affection will be heraulds to blaze the praise of those which deserue it not, & so are foūd false witnesses. God forbid (saith Iob to his friends, when he knew them faulty) Iob 27. 5. that I should iustifie you: so should euery great man say, when he is sollicited to speake or write in a bad mans cause: God forbid that I should iustifie the wicked, I were as much to blame to iustifie the wicked, as to con∣demne the innocent, I will testifie the truth, Iob 27. 3. 4 so long as my breath is in me, and: he spirit of God in my nostrels, my lips sure∣ly shall speake no wickednesse, and my tongue shall vtter no de∣ceit. And thus much of the breach of this commandement by speach, it is broken by silence, either in suffering, when wee shall lend our eares without reproofe to those which shall giue false report, either of our selues, or of others, or secondly in do∣ing, when (though our voice be not heard) we shall vilifie our neighbour either outwardly by our gesture, or inwardly in our heart. Men giue false report of vs two contrary wayes, either by vntrue commendation, or vniust accusation: the first sort are
flatterers, which will commend in vs those qualities wee haue not, or too much extoll those we haue, which will commend all our actions as good, and the best with wondring interiecti∣ons, which will make vs beleeue wee know not our owne worth, & blesse themselues with both their hands, if any thing proceede from vs worthy, but meane commendation: Wee must not giue eare to these claw-backs, but stop their passage, and bend our browes vpon excessiue praise, neuer courting it otherwise then it followes vpon good courses. There be three speciall reasons which should moue vs to open our lips, and re∣proue these kinde of persons: some of them leuell at their owne profit, their Art is nothing but delightfull cousenage; the Fox in the Fable commendeth the Crow, to see if he can make him open his mouth and let fall the prey; these men will spend their tongues to maintaine their teeth; they are Moathes which will cate out a liberall mans coate, Vines which will creepe to the stakes that stand by them, not for loue to the stakes, but to vp∣hold themselues; therefore Antishenes would say, it were bet∣ter for a man to fall among Rauens then among flatterers, for Rauens will eate none but the dead, but these will eate out a man while he is aliue. Some of them intend mischiefe, as the Pharisies, who like Barge-men looke one way when they rowe another, who vn∣der enticing baites haue entangling hookes, who in propound∣ing a question to Christ concerning paying tribute, giue him great commendation that they may the sooner entangle him inMath. 22. 16. his answere. Iosephs words to his brethren were rough, but his meaning was smooth, hee caried a brotherly affection to∣wardsGen. 42. 7. them, but these mens words are soft as oyle, when they be very swords: this fawning hypocrisie, this Court holy wa∣ter, this dishonest ciuility, this base merchandize of words is nothing but gilded treason, carrying vs vp as they in the Syna∣gogue did Christ to the top of the hill, to throw vs downeuc. 4. 29. headlong: therefore Diogenes being asked what beast biteth sorest, answered, of wilde beasts, a back-biter; of tame beasts, a flatterer; he is like the luie, which killeth with culling. Lastly, all of them make vs forget our selues, for pride sea∣aeth vpon vs, when we are commended through flattery, as
the two Elders did on Susanna, when she was annointed with oyle: therefore one saith, if they among whom thou liuest, doe not commend thee, when thou deseruest well, they are in fault, but if they commend thee, thou art in danger, for men are blowne vp with praise, as it were with Gunpowder: the peo∣ple in saying, after Herod had ended his Oration, Nec vox ho∣minem sonat, committed verball symonie; so Herod depen∣ding on vulgar breath, was too well conceited of himselfe, and robbing God of his honour, committed sacriledge, therefore he was eaten of wormes, and gaue vp the ghost. This flatteryAct. 12. 22. 23. what can it not? therefore Alexander the great, though at first he delighted in those which said hee was filius Iouis, yet being wounded with an Arrow at the siege of a Citie, hee re∣garded no longer the false colours of adulation, with which others are tickled to death; therefore Canutus, a King of this Land, about thirty yeares before the conquest, did breake that false glasse, which presented him a face not his owne; for when as one, to sooth him vp, tolde him, hee was as God, and all things were at his beck and commaund, he caused his Chayre of estate to be brought to the Sea shore at Southampton, and as the water flowed, thus he said, Tu me  ditionis es, &c. Thou art vnder my dominion, neuer any one who disobeyed me, went scot-free▪ I charge thee enter no further on my land, presume not to wet the robes or any member of me thy Lord & Master. The Sea notwithstanding keeping it course, without doing any reuerence, wet the Kings feete: whereupon he giuing backe, said, The Lord is God, and him onely doe windes and Sea obey: and after to know what hee was, hee would giue no credence to other. Thus if within thy selfe thou doest not be∣hold thy selfe; if thou, who art most priuy, and shouldst be least partiall to thine owne worth, restest on others commen∣dation, and standest not on thine owne bottome, if thou canst be silent when others flatter with their tongue, and feed thee with the winde, thou consentest with those which against this law by flattery beare false witnes. Contrary to these are another sort, whose tongues are euer walking in the track of vniust accusations. Iob would not be silent in this case, for if he had held his tongue, it would haue
bin thought he had bin euen such a one as they said; therefore when Elyphaz charged him with cruelty, iniustice, and op∣pression, that he had spoiled the cloathes of the naked, that he had not giuen to the weary water to drinke, that he had with∣drawne bread from the hungry, Iob 22, 6. 7. Iob cleares himselfe, and saith, he did not eate his morsels alone, the fatherlesse did eate thereof, that the loynes of those which wanted clothing, blessed him, because they were couered with the fleece of his sheepe: so when Iob 3. 17. 20 Festus said of Paul, Thou art besides thy selfe, much learning doth make thee madde. Paul is as ready to make his Salue, as Festus is to giue the wound: I am not mad Act. 26. 25. O noble Festus (saith he) but I speake the words of truth and sobernesse. Christ was a Lyon and a Lambe, so is euery Christian, patient as a Lambe to suffer in his innocency, bolde as a Lyon to plead and defend it, not a Lyon in his conuersation, nor sheepish when slaundered; he sets his foot by his, that shall wrongfully accuse him: when his accusers, as busie as Flyes, will light, where there is no sore, his tongue shall be a flap to fray them away, and now is his speach powdred with salt. Indeed Mary was accused three seuerall times. Luc. 7. 39. The Pharisie accused her of presumption that being a sinner she would touch Christ: Luc. 10. 40. Se∣condly, Martha accused her of idlenesse, that she suffered her to serue alone: Thirdly, Ioh. 12. 5. Iudas accused her of prodigality, that she wasted the oyntment: shee was alwayes patient, and put vp all, she knew her selfe a stranger euen at home, and let the dogges of the world barke at her, she was a woman, and would be seene and not heard, her sex required the more si∣lence, besides her Sauiour did at all times answere for her, ac∣cording to that saying in another case: Exod. 14. 14 The Lord shall fight for you therefore holde you your peace. Againe, if any wrong other, by scandalous imputation, and open, their mouthes boldly to sound out detraction and slaun∣der, as some will sit and speake against their Brother, andPsal. 50. 20. slaunder their owne Mother Son; we sin by silence, if we doe not with courage beare out the accused, whom we know then Innocent, and therefore when Peter heard that the Apostles were accused of Drunkennesse as being full of new Wine, his spirit was hote within him; and while he was musing, the fire
kindled, and at last he spake with his Tongue. Act. 2. 15. These are not Drunken, as yee suppose, since it is but the third houre of the day, &c. If a malicious man be giuen to traduce a mans name, we cannot stop his mouth from speaking ill, yet must we open our mouthes to reproue him, else lending him a willing eare wee consent with him, and haue beene partakers with the backbiter, bearing the Diuell as much in our eares as the other in his tongue, hrting our neighbour as well by receiuing as the other by giuing out and dispersing spitefull narrations, and therefore this giuing forth and receiuing, in the Law are cou∣pled together, or rather meete in one word, Exod. 23. 1. Thou shalt not report or receiue a false tale: You will blame a Thiefe for stealing, and will not you blame him that receiueth stollen goods? Were there no Receiuers there would be no Theeues: You will blame a man that robbes one of his▪ good name, and will you not blame him that opens his eares to take in the theft? There would not be so many to broach false rumours, were it not that they see they please other mens taste: yee will blame him that robbes God of his honour, else the Curse will come vpon you which doth vpon the men of Meroz, because they came not foorth Iudg. 5. 23. to hepe the Lord, to helpe the Lord a∣gainst the mighty: blame him likewise which wrongeth man by false report, winke not at his folly, smother not his fault; doe not swallow it, doe not digest it; reproue such a man, tell him his owne; there is little difference Faueas ne scelus an illud faias, if the Backbiter shall see by thy face, that hee hath a roome in thy heart, thou art an abetter of euill, a Pander to his sinne, a good Nurse of ill fame, a Wolfe to thy Brother, and in a word, possessed with a dumbe Diuell. Againe, other breake this Commandement by silence, either outwardly in their gesture, when indeed they doe not scourge with their Tongue, nor speake wordes like the prickings of a Sword, when they doe not digge vp euill, neither is there in their lippes like burning fire, but though they shoote not out the venemous sting of their Tongue, yet they nippe men by their gesture, and spit out their venome by the malicious car∣riage of their bodies, the Prophet complaineth of such, Psal. 22. 13 They
gaped vpon me with their mouthes as it were a ramping and roaring Lyon, Psal. 35. 15. making mowes at me and ceased not, such were they Math. 27. 39 which wagged their heades as they passed by at the Passion of Christ, and before that Ioh. 13. 18. Iudas who lift vp his heele against Christ, and after that the Iewes Act. 7. 54. who gnashed at Stephen with their teeth, if wee shall hisse or point at any with our finger, or shake our heades against them without a∣ny offence or fault of theirs, we disgrace them with this kinde of gesture, and are a kinde of false witnesses while we make them vile in other mens eyes: or else we breake this Law in∣wardly in our heart, when though we neither whet our tongue like a Sword, and shoot for our Arrowes bitter wordes, though we shoote not out the venemous sting of a reproachfull ge∣sture, yet we haue a hard conceit of our neighbour, when he deserues it not: Abraham faulted this way when he thought the Aegiptians would haue killed him, if they did but know that Gen. 12. 11. Sarah was his wife: So did Iosephs Brethren, who though they saw that Ioseph was made of a mettall not so hard as flexible, though he let all their iniuries goe as they came, though he would not goe beyond the word of the Lord, but render them good, when they had rendred him euill, yet when their Father was dead as though before that he made but small noyse as the waters of Sil at the foote of Sion, because he was vnwilling to trouble or grieue the Old man, they thought he would deale more roughly with them, and pay them againe all the euill, that they had done vnto him: So Gen 50. 15. Pharaoh, though he had no cause to distrust the Israelites, yet heeExod. 1. 10. thought they would watch a time, and set themselues against him when they could finde opportunity to re∣bell.Math. 9. 3. So the blasphemous Scribes slaundered our Sauiour, because he said hee had authority on earth to forgiue sinnes, but their malice against Christ caused them to take all his say∣ings, all his doings with the left hand; whereas if wee haue loue, all our constructions are full of charity and fauour: and if any thing be spoken which may carie a double sence, our glosse shall not corrupt the Text, we wll make a good expo∣sition, if we haue but a good disposition.
The tenth Commandement. Exod. 20. 17. Thou shalt not covet thy Neighbours house, &c. THis Commandement is as the Sun-beame, in which the least mote may be discerned; Paul had not knowne lust had beene sinne, except this Commandement had said, Thou shalt not lust; it plucks vp euery roote, that it bring not forth Gall or Wormewood, it breakes the Egge, that sinne hatch not, with the Physitian it takes the Viper in the springe, and present∣ly cuts it in peeces, it shutteth vp euery vaine thought, as in an Ephah, and casteth a Talent of Lead vpon the mouth of it, it speakes with our enemies in the gate, and with Lot, will not suffer them to enter, it stoppeth not the water-course, but dry∣eth vp the fountaines head, it killeth the first begotten of the De∣uill, & slayes Goliah by hitting him on the forehead: in a word, it is a sword which cuts asunder the heart strings of euery fleting imagination, though we yeeld no consent, or cast & plod how to bring it into act. The things forbidden vs to couet, are set out Parti∣cularly as that wch our neigh∣bour hath at home his house. his hous∣hold his wife. his ser∣uants man∣seruāt. maide. abroad, his Oxe. his Asse. Generally any thing that is his. Thou shalt not couet.] The other Commandements will not let Satan haue a chamber to dwell in the heart, this thrusts him out as soone as he lookes in at the doore, and therefore the word v∣sed is inceptivum, to shew that the very first motion is sinne, though no consent be yeelded, though it conceiues not, though
it passeth away like Lightning, which oritur, moritus, is but a flash and away, though like a Post vpon the spurre, it stayeth not to drinke at the doore, though presently we giue it ouer, as the Phy∣sitian doth his Patient, when he lyes a dying. Here we see the perfection of Gods law, here neede no statute of Addition to keepe man within the compasse of his duty: Lawes of men looke but into wordes, or prune onely the outrage of euill actions, at most they punish but the intent, & neuer that, except it be con∣fessed, as the Parliament of Paris put a Gentleman of Norman∣die to death, for that he confessed to a Franciscan Fryer, he was once minded to haue killed King Francis the 2. And therefore Senca sayd, Quam agusta est innocentia ad legem bonum esse; it is but halfe a mans honetie to be no better then the Law maketh him, but the Law of God cuts in sunder as well the cordes of va∣nitie, as cart-ropes of iniquitie, and is not onely seuere against the actions of ull, but against the affections, condemning eue∣ry idle thought, though it be concealed within vs, though it make not so long abode with vs, as the small flyes doe by the ri∣uer Hipanis, which are bred in the morning, are in their full strength at noone, and gone at night but though they be but as a Diuedapper, which peereth vp and is downe againe in a mo∣ment, though they be but as a dreame, not Gen. 41. 8 Pharaohs dreame, which he could remember to tell his Wise-men the next mor∣ning, but Dan. 2. 5. Nabuchadnezzars dreame, which he had presently forgotten. This teacheth vs to humble our selues before God, not relying on our owne worth, but Gods mercy: A good man happily may say for the fact, as the elder sonne, Luc. 15. 29 neuer brake I at any time thy Commandement; or as Paul, 1 Cor. 4. 4. I know nothing by my selfe. And for his wordes, happily he may say with Dauid, Psal. 39. 1. I kept my mouth as it were with a bridle, and so with Iob, Iob. 2. 10. not sinne with his lippes: but who can say My heart is cleane, that, though filled with the holy Ghost, hath it blemishes, as the full Moone it darke spottes, therefore Dauid hauing spoken of the righteous∣nesse of the Law, cryeth out, Ps. 19. 12. Who can tell how oft he offendeth: O cleanse thou me from my secret faults Iob. 23. 4.. Iob is ouerseene when he speaketh as though a righteous man might plead with God, and make his farthing good siluer; his friends tell him in effect, all he fayth is but prittle prattle, and if God should enter into iudg∣ment with him, who did thinke so well of himselfe, he were not
able to abide it, for though it were so that he had brought forth no euill fruits in the boughes, yet God might cut him downe, because he was faultie at the roote. Thy neighbours house. Not naming house first, because we should set more by the house, then by the wife, for God repeating this commandement Deu. 5. 21 in Deuteronomy, and setting downe all things according to their due estimatiō, puts the wife in the first place, Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wife, neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours house: but here for orders sake, he sets downe first contineus, then contentum, first the house, then the housholder, and in very deede, though a wife be prior honore, and more to be esteemed, yet a house is prior tempore, and first to be prouided, neither will a wise man take a wife before he hath a house, though some be so vndiscreete, that when they be single, they thinke they lacke nothing but a wife, and when they haue a wife, they lacke an house and all things besides. House. God in his Law would not allow that a man should take for a Pledge any thing in the house, which was necessary for sustentation of life & health Deu. 24. 6.: for this is to kill the borrow∣er, he doth but change the kinde of death, as if one should be in danger to be hanged with his owne handes, one should come and vntie the rope, but yet cut his throate; if we must not take such a Pledge in the house, much lesse the house it selfe. If a man did meete his enemies Asse going astray Exo. 23. 4., he should bring him home to him againe, then must he not make his neighbour an Asse, turne him out of house and home and send him a begging. This condemneth such as neuer thinke themselues well seated while they dwell by neighbours, and therefore depopulate Pa∣rishes, as though they would dwell alone vpon the earth. Zophar shewing how Cormorants deuoure other, sayth, Iob. 20. 19 they spoyle houses which they builded not. As if he should say, their predeces∣sors had a care to set vp houses, and were glad to haue their poore Tenants dwell by them, but their posteritie, a preposte∣rous and pitiles generation, doe pull downe their houses, with downe with them, downe with them euen to the ground: Iob speaketh of such as Iob. 3. 14. builded themselues desolate places: not onely meaning such as builded in barren places, to get them a name, nor such as hauing builded houses, did leaue them desolate, but such as by pulling downe neighbour houses did dwell alone,
like master-Hares, which are of this propertie, that if there be a bucke or a female which keepe one quarter commonly toge∣ther, they will not suffer any but their owne young to sit by them, or abide neare them. This hath beene noted as a great fault in our Nation, and therefore Goropius thinketh the Eng∣lish men were called Angli, because they were good Anglers, and had skill to lay diuers bayts, when they fished for other mens li∣uings: which though it be not true (for therefore were we cal∣led Angli, of a people so called, which came in with the Saxons, who were numerosissimi and fortissimi, more for number, and stronger for power, then the rest) yet hath it a semblance of truth, for men draw vnto them other mens liuings by hooke & by crooke, and deuoure houses, euen widowes houses, as great fish deuoure the small: the fault and cause hereof in Sr Thomas Moores Vtopia is layd vpon sheepe, which (as it is there sayd) were wont to be Mites & exiguo ali, gentle, and contented with a little foode, but now are so great feeders, and so vnruly, that (as it followeth) they eate vp men, fieldes, houses, and lay whole Villages wast: insomuch, as some market Towne in our Country doe take their names of the abundance of Cattell, as, Shipston, and Kineton in Warwickshire, in or by the vale of Redhorse. I know it is a great blessing of God when sheepe doe bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets, for wooll is the staple of the land, and one meanes to raise vp the pillers of it, but are not children a greater blessing? the Prophet stam∣peth this blessing with an Ps. 127. 3. Ecce, loe, children and the fruite of the wombe are an heritage and gift that commeth of the Lord. In the Ca∣talogue of Deu. 28. 4 Blessings, the fruit of the body is set before the fruit of the cattle, and the divell tempting Iob. 1. 16. 19. Iob by degrees, each temptation being greater then other, takes away the sheepe b∣fore the seruants, and feruants before the children, is not man (saith our Saviour Christ much) Mat. 12. 12 better then a sheepe: doth not the honour and strength of the King and the kingdome consist in the multitude of subiects, let sheep therfore haue their coates and their foldes, but while sheepe are penned in, let not men and children be penned out, let sheepe haue their pasture, let Exod. 3. 1. Moses feede the sheepe of lethro: let Gen. 29. 10. Iacob roll the stone from the wells mouth and water the flocke, but let sheepe rather be as much abho∣mination
to vs as Gen. 46. 34. shepheards to the Egiptians, let a man rather nourish but one kowe and two sheepe, then so many flockes, as he cannot feede, except he pull downe neighbours houses, and ioyning land to land to feede them, giue men as sheepe to be eaten vp. The people vnder Moses charge were so many, that Moses sayth, shall the sheepe and the beeues be slaine to feedeNum. 11. 22 them: as if he should say, there are men enough to eate them vp all, and shall now the sheepe be so many that they shall eate vp the people. Hee that doth but dreame of his neighbours li∣uing, and thinkes his owne habitation would be more pleasant or profitable, if he could once winde out him that dwels neare him, though he presently nips this imagination as the frost the forward springs, though he stops this stone at the top of the hill before it be in a violent course, though he suffers not consent to hearten that which he doth imagine, nor his will resolue vpon it, yet is he guiltie of the breach of this law, and therefore (to conclude this point) never say when thou seest any thing faire or commodious, as men commonly doe, I would this were mine, but if thou be readie to draw any thing thou seest to an occasion of offending, stopp there as Iob. 31. 7. Iob did, whose steppe turned not out of the way, whose heart did not walke after his eye, but when it would be gadding, whither it should not, he did presently daunt it with dislike. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife. Our adversaries the Papists who take away the second commandement, because it cuts a sunder the hart-strings of their superstition, to fill vp the number of Ten, devide this commandement into two, so that thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house, shall be the ninth, and this concerning the wife &c. shall be the tenth, but Saint Paul confteth them, who speaking of the law in generall saith, o theRom. 7. 12. law is holy: and of that which forbiddeth concupiscence in par∣ticular makes it but one cōmandement,  with an empha∣sis is holy. iust and good. Not covet thy neighbous wife: The greatest iniurie and indeede a wrong not to be paralleled vpon earth, is when the man shall breake the faith plighted to his wife, or the woman bee false to her owne bosome, God punished this sinne in Gē. 12. 17. Pharoh, and Gen. 20. 3 A∣bimelech, though God kept them that they came not nigh Abra∣hamsc Gen. 39. 9 wife, and therefore when Putiphar committed all that hee
had into Iosephs hand, he barred him of his wife, and in this case Xenophon was put to his non plus, for being asked if his neighbour had a better house then he, whose he had rather haue, his or his owne? he answered, his: if he had a fairer horse then he, whose had he rather haue? he answered, his: if he had a better or fairer wife then he, whose had he rather haue? hic Xenophon ipse tacuit: at this Xenophon was silent: a man must hold his owne wife for bet∣ter for worse, so long as they both shall liue: corrupt affections like Eue lie in our bosome, and will seduce vs: vnruly motions are to our vnderstanding as Dalilah to Sampson, they burne within vs as brimstone at the match, let this law draw out the burning venome of those fiery serpents that lurke in our hearts: if a man bee vpon a horse that flingeth and kicketh, and doth what hee can to run ouer all the field, the cunning rider will reine him vp) and bring him to a good pace, so a good Chri∣stian will ouer-master his passions, and suppresse them, when they are miscarried to rebell, he will direct humors to their right courses, and draw the flood of affections into their owne cha∣nell. Wife: In that God setting downe the houshold, goods, and chattles and all that a man hath, put the wife in the first place, I note that to be true which Salomon saith Pro. 31 10 the price of a vertuous woman is farre aboue the pearles: which teacheth first the husband to loue his wife more then any earthly thing: when Alexander had ouercome Darius, Darius seemed little to regard his estima∣tion, if he were to die, he seemed little to regard his life, but when he heard his wife was taken prisoner, hincillae lacrimae, then his eyes did spout forth teares, as the conduit waters, each teare did ouertake other, he did ouerweepe his weeping, and sighes did breake from the center of his heart, as fast as the teares stoale downe his cheekes: againe it teacheth that of all other things a man should not wrong his neighbour in his wife, as the wife of Hieron was acquainted with no bodies breath, but her husbands, for when he (his enemie casting in his teeth his stinking breath) blamed his wife, who neuer told him of it, she desired him not to thinke the worse of her, for shee thought euery mans breath had smelt like vnto his: so on the other side, should the husband be acquainted with no bodies breath, but his wiues: she for her part must be as the Marigold, which of all the Plants opens
onely to the Sunne: let not him for his part be as the sed horse, eigh after his neighbours wife, and croake in the chamber like the froggs of Egipt, his eyes must be eyes of Adamant, which will turne onely to one point, let not his be wandring eyes, let him not make the faces of other mens wiues like glasses, which the Larke-taker hath in his day net, least while like the birds he gaze too much, he be taken in the net: it is set downe as one of 2 Sam. 11 4. Davids greatest faults, that suffering lust to enter in at the win∣dowes of his eyes he gaue way to his sinne, till he did lie with the wife of Vriah, and therefore set not the thoughts on fire by af∣fection, much lesse follow the lusts of the flesh, much lesse ful∣fill the lust of the flesh, much lesse prouoke the lust of the flesh, but put the axe of Gods iudgments to the roote of wanton na∣ture and cut it off, circumcise the foreskin of the hart, that is the true circumcision, in the spirit not in the letter, whose praise is not of men but of God. Nor his manservant nor his mayde: As well Salomon the diuine, as Aristotle and other Humane Philosophers in their Oeconomicks, set downe not the wife and seruants onely, but the children also; and God commanding to hallow the sabbth sayth, in it thouc Exo. 20 10 shalt not doe any worke, thou nor thy sonne, nor thy daughter, thy man∣servant, nor thy maide: a question then may here be asked, why sonnes and daughters are not mentioned as well as the wife, the manseruant and the maide: the reason I take to bee this: men are addicted either to their pleasure or their profit: Pleasure, like yre, inchanteth the minde, transformeth men into swine, and mastereth reason with sensualitie, neither was it a greater mi∣racle to see the three children walke vntoucht in the midst of the fiery furnace, then to see, how Ioseph held his body short of plea∣sures in the present prouocation, therefore couet not thy neigh∣bours wife, was a necessary precept: againe for profit, it is true which the Apostle sayth, Phil. 2. 21 All seeke their owne, and therefore like Martha they are Luke 10. 0. cumbred with much busines, & are so farre from serving one another Gal. 5. 13. by loue, as the Apostle aduiseth, that as though they did enue that another should haue a better servant then they, they are readie to lay baites to draw him to them, and therefore it was not without neede, to say thou shalt not couet thy neighbours seruant: but children are a charge to him that keepe them, must be led into wholsome pastures, because they
be Gods lambes, watred because they be the seed-plot of hea∣uen, they must be kept cleane, because they be Gods vessels, and kept in, that after flowers of youth, may follow fruits of good liuing they haue no list in age to liue as they should, which haue libertie in youth to liue as they list, because men are loth to take this care and this charge, therefore they neuer couet other mens children, nay they will hardly be intreated to take another mans sonne or his daughter, nay let a father giue money with his child that another may take him, but as his apprentise, yet hardly wil he take him and teach him the trade of his way, and bring him vp in instruction and information of the Lord: in a word there∣fore as well sonnes as seruants are commanded to keepe holy the Sabbath, because both sorts are readie to transgresse it, but none are forbidden to couet sonnes, as they are to couet seruants, be∣cause that without a prohibition men are readie to obserue it. Manseruant nor his maide: As God hath made the seruants lower then the wife, so he hath here giuen them place before the Oxe or the Asse, which must teach the master to make more reckoning of his seruants, then of any Cattell he keepeth: he must haue an especiall care of their bodies, and of their soules; of their bodies in sicknesse, and in health, in sicknesse not to let Gods visitation be an excuse to discarde them, that so they may lye at Lu. 16. 20. the gate with Lazarus, but with the good Mat. 8. 6. Centurion, let them lye at home with them, and seeke the best meanes they can to recouer them: in health, not to lay more on them then they are able to beare, for a good man is Pro. 12. 10 mercifull to his beast much more to his brother: 2. with the good housholder to giue them their penny which labour in the Vineyard: 3. with the good housewife to giue Mat. 20. 9. the portion to Pro. 31. 15 their seruants, and ordinary to their maydes: As he is carefull for their bodies, so he must labour to fashion their mindes to goodnesse. Iob. 11. 14 Zophar telleth Iob, it is not enough for him to serue God in his owne person, but he must see that no wickednesse dwell in his Tabernacle: and therefore Dauid had a care to haue Ps. 101. 4. his houshold well reformed, and the care of Iohn for his Disciples was at libertie when he himselfe was bound in the prison: the reason that the Master should haue this Mat. 11. 1. care is very good, for as it is here sayde, they are his seruants: and in deede, Masters are not more their owne, then their seruants are theirs, and therefore the faults of the Familie reflect vpon
them, and the sinnes of their seruants are their reproach. Againe, they of the family because they are seruants must serue, must with the labourers in the vineyard beare the burden and heate of thep Mat. 20. 12 day, and when necessity requires, not suffer their eyes to sleepe, nor eye-lids to slumber, but with Iacob incroach vpon the nightq Gen. 31. 40. for him, they must not be like the seruant in the Gospell, whor Mat. 24. 49. playes Rex, as though he would throw the house out at window, but like those, which are vnder the Centurion, which goe whens Mat. 8. 9. he bids them goe, come, when he bids them come, which doe this or that when he bids them doe it, neither must they be ser∣uants onely, but men and not beasts, mayds and not strumpets, there be many that will not eate the bread of idlenes, but eate the labour and fruit of their hands, who diligently & willingly put their singers to their masters businesse, who knowing they are borne to labour, as the sparkes flye vpward, rise vp early & late take rest, gird their loynes, and strengthen their hands to work, but there is more force in one vice they haue, to disgrace all their paines, then in all their paines to maintaine that vice. Nor his Oxe nor his Asse. He hath made a good steppe to per∣fection that can say with Samuel 1 Sam. 12 3. whose Oxe haue I taken, or whose Asse haue I taken: but he that can say thus, may yet say with the yong man, Mat. 19. 21 what lacke I yet, & with Elizabeth he hath 1 Kin. 19. 7 a further iourney to goe: for the law of God is of such perfecti∣on, that it not onely bindes the hand to the good abearing, that it take not, but the heart that it couet not, condemning , though the motion dies in the conception, and the graue preventeth the cradle. Nor any thing that is his. The holy Ghost in the Epistle to the Romanes, hauing expressed many Cōmandements of the second Table, which forbid speciall sinnes by name, at last comes in as it were with a statute of Additions, which cuts off all in generall, Rō. 13. 9. If there be any other Commandement, it is briefely comprehended in this saying, euen in this; Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe: so if God hath not set downe euery particular thing in this Com∣mandement by expresse name, which we are forbidden to couet, it is briefely comprehended in this saying, namely; Thou shalt not couet any thing that is his. Some will say, I desire not my neigh∣bours house, but he hath a peece of land bordering vpon my ground, I would that were mine, but this is forbidden by flat sta∣tute,
Deu. 5. 21 for Moses repeating the Law, sayth, Thou shalt not desire thy neighbours house, his field. And Mic. 2. 2. Micah chargeth Israel with this, they covet fieldes: and 1. Ki. 21. 1. Ahab is much blamed for that he was sicke of Naboths vineyard, which lay neere to his house: but were it not expressely forbidden, yet it came within the reach of this addition, Thou shalt not covet any thing that is his. Another sayth, I covet not my neighbours wife, happily he thinkes he hath too much wife of his owne, as that young man, who at first was in hand with his father to giue him two wiues, his father because of his importunity, gaue him one in hand, promising at the yeers end to giue him another, but when the yeare was expired, he told his father, he had wife enough, and did finde compact in a little flesh a great number of bones, too hard to digest, and if o∣ther mens were like vnto his, they were all molten out of that salt piller into which Lots wife was transformed: neither doth he happily couet any seruant of his house, but fayne he would haue some of his houshold-stuffe, his goods or chattels; but Paul, who sayth, Be followers of me, doth patterne against this, Act. 20. 33 I haue, sayth he, coveted no mans siluer, nor gold, nor apparell; but were there no particular example or law to the contrary, yet this prohibiti∣on meets with it, Thou shalt not covet any thing that is his: Our na∣ture is readie to find a starting hole to get out, when we haue of∣fended: sinnes and shifts are borne at a birth, we will haue a salue for euery sore, as he that sels Anchusam or Orchanet, complexion for euery face: Saul sayth, 1 Sam. 15. 13. I haue kept the Commandement of the Lord: Mat. 25. 44. they on the left hand say, they haue ministred vnto Christ, though they neglected his members: and were it not for this closing vp, some would say with the elder sonne, Luc 15. 29 at no time brake I thy Commandement: therfore to prevent all pleas, the law sayth, he hath transgressed that coveteth not onely this thing or that thing, but any thing that his neighbour hath: it is his, therefore hand of, that thou doe not take it: it is his, therefore heart of, that thou doe not couet it. Is his. There be some things in which man hath a propertie, which maketh against , & communitie of the Anabap∣tists, and in deede, if all things were common, what vse could there be of charitie, which the second Table requireth? How could the Common-wealth endure, who would labour & take payne, if mens goods were mingled altogether, if there were not
meum and tuum: indeed in the primitiue Church, Act. 2. 44. the Disciples had all things common, but this communitie stretched no fur∣ther then to the releefe of those that wanted: for wheras in these times, men are giuen to hoard vp, and like dogs deuoure, what they can catch, and gape continually for more, so that this is true, Some all, some neuer a whit; (and this, they say, is good in pol∣licie, lest equality should breed confusion, as if there must needs be equalitie, if there were not so great inequalitie) in those times it was other wise, for many (as Act. 4. 36. Ioses is set downe by name, as though he deserued better this way then the rest) when they saw how hard the world went with the poorer sort, would re∣lieue them with their yearely revennewes, if that were not e∣nough, they would sell some part of their possessions, and mo∣derately relieue the necessitie of other, according as they sawe their want, not that all did this, that were accounted Christians, or that they which did it were compelled to it, for Act. 5. 4. Peter telleth Ananias, that before he sould his possession, it was his, and after it was solde, it was in his owne power, he neede not haue solde it, or put his money to the common vse) or that S. Luke would vrge vs to take the very same stitches out of their Samplers, and yet, as the inequalitie is divelish, where one is readie to dye for want of meate, another is killed with surfet and excesse, so that equalitie is alwayes commendable, where the plentie of one supplyes the penury of another: When Dauid stands in need of succour, Nabal is too churlish to stand vpon this, 1 Sam. 25 11. My bread, and my water, and my flesh. In these times rich men would haue all waters fall into their sea, & yet their sea is not full; in those times Aarons oyle rested not on his head, but ranne downe vpon his beard, & went down to the very skirts of his clothing. Againe, it is a common saying, which Tully, in his first booke De legibus, fathers vpon Pythagoras, others vpon Plato, , all things should be common among friends; What then should there be no inclosures, should no man haue any thing priuate to himselfe? Aristotle 2o Politicorum, expounds the saying thus, That should be common for vse, which is proper to possesse, so that which is one mans quo ad , should be other mens quo ad ; and indeede, as Ioseph said to his mistresse, My master hath not kept any Gen. 39. 9 thing from me, but onely thee, because thou art his wife; so should no man keepe from other that he hath, but vpon
reasonable tearmes let him haue according to his necessitie, the vse of it, except it be the wife, because she is his wife, and this is a vertue enioyned by this commandement, for as we must con∣tent our selues with our owne estate, which is a preseruatiue a∣gainst coveting that which is another mans, so must wee haue a desire to do our neighbour good, which is a preparatiue to helpe him with that which is our owne. Exo. 17. 12 Aaron and Hur lent Moses their hands, when he was weary in holding vp his hands: Luc. 5. 7. Peters partners helped him with their Nets, when his owne Net was broken; a good man as he is no mans enemy, so is he not more his owne, then another mans friend; thus the Moone receiuing light from the Sunne, lets it shine vnto the world; thus the true lights of the firmament are still in motiō for the good of others, thus the hart receiuing spirits from the liver, doth minister them to the brayne, and the brayne to other parts of the body. Nature hath taught the Deere to helpe one another in swimming; the Cranes one another in flying; one stone beares vp another in buildings contriued by art; nothing is made for it selfe; and no∣thing is good vnto vs, except we communicate the same good vnto others, and therefore the Gal. 5. 13. Scripture will haue vs seruants to all, and God bindes vs vnto it by force, and drawes vs as it were by the hayre of the head, in distributing to sundry persons different graces, that they might mutually succour and inter∣changeably helpe one another. Of the three 1 Cor. 13 Sisters which ne∣uer part from one anothers sides, faith lookes to God and his Word, hope to his gift and reward, charitie to the profit and commoditie one of another: God make our charitie like the lampe of the Ex. 27. 20 Tabernacle, which alwayes burned, and the fire of the Altar which neuer went out; make our hope as the piller of fire, which guided Israel to the land of Ex. 13. 21. Canaan; increase our faith till we receiue the end of our faith, even the 1 Pet. 1. 9. saluation of our soules, thorough Iesus Christ our Lord, to whom with the Father, and the holy Ghost, three persons and one euerliuing God, be giuen all honour and glory, power, prayse, & dominion, both now and for euer, AMEN. FINIS.
