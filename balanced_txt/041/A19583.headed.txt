A HANDFVL: OR Rather a Heartfull of holy meditations and Prayers. Gathered out of certaine ancient Manuscripts, written 300 yeares ago, or more. By WILLIAM CRASHAW Batchelour of Diuinity, and Preacher at the Temple.
TO THE RIGHT HO∣NOVRABLE LORD: HENRY THE Noble Earle of NORTH∣HAMPTON, Lord priuy Seale, Lord Warden of the Cinc{que} Ports, and one of his Maiesties Honourable priuy Counsell. RIGHT Honoura∣ble, our Aduersa∣ries amongst their many obiections against vs and our Religion, vse this
for one, that if wee refuse their Church, and con∣demne their faith, wee con∣demne to hell all our fore∣fathers. But it followeth not: for in such fundamental points as necessarily con∣cerne saluation, as mat∣ter of merit, and meanes of Iustification, &c. our fa∣thers in former times were not of the Romish faith, but of our Religion: excluding, disclayming, & renouncing all their owne merits, and cleauing only to Gods mer∣cy, and the merits of Iesus Christ for their saluation. This was the faith of the an∣cient Church, &c. SaintBasillius in homel in Psal. 114. Basil saith. Eternall rest re∣maines
for them which haue fought a good fight in this world, yet not for the merit of their workes, but through the rich mercies of God, in whom they trust. Saint Hillary saith, ourHillarius in Psal. 51. workes suffice not to merit eternall life, but our hope is in the mercy of God for e∣uer and euer. Saint Augustine saith,Augustinus concione 1 in Psal. 70. Tua peccata sunt, merita Dei sunt: supplici∣um tibi debe∣tur, et cum praemium ve∣nerit sua dona coronabit non tua merita. Sin is ours, Merit is Gods: Punishments are our due, but if rewardes come, God crownes his owne gifts, not our merites. Gregory moral lib. 9. ca. 14.Saint Gregory (a Pope) saith, If I doe well, I shall haue eternall life, not by my merits but Gods mercy.
And long after euen inBernardus sermone. 15. in Psal. 90. the darkest times; deuote Bernard saith, A mans whole merit is to put the whole af∣fiance of his heart in him, that hath saued the whole man, and therfore in another place he concludes, My me∣rit is the mercy of the Lord. All these Bellarmine can∣notSermone 61. in Cant. meri∣tum meum miseratio do∣mini. deny, and himselfe pro∣duceth some of them or all, but shapes such answeres to them, as it would satisfye an indifferent man euen to read him in that pont. And this was not the faithBellar. to. 4. lib. 5. de lust. cap. 6. of the principall Fathers on∣ly, but by the mercy of God, it was deriued euen vnto the inferiour, and vul∣gar
sort, not of the Cleargy alone, but euen of the Laity also. If the monuments of elder ages were extant & vncorrup¦ted, it is more thē maruailous how cleerly this truth would shine: that our forefathers were not damned, though they beleeued, not as doth the present Romish Church: Nay further that they were saued by the same faith by which wee are at this day, though they were misled by some errours, and nusled in some superstitions; for which (being sinnes of in∣firmity, or rather of igno∣rance) we hope the Lord was mercifull vnto them, know∣ing
that euen Dauid him∣selfe cried to God to clensePsal. 19. him from his secret sinnes. But such hath beene the craft and malice of Popish policy, that partly the oldest bookes are embezilled and extinguished, and those that remaine are so altered cor∣rupted and depraued from that they were, that there now remaines not one of many of the testimonies, which the former ages yeel∣ded to this truth. Notwithstanding the prouidence of God hath not failed his Church: for (do what they could) yet he who said the gates of hellMath. 16. should not preuaile against the
true faith, hath taken order in spight of all plots to the contrary, that so many testi∣monies shall be preserued, as shall sufficiently witnesse to the world that our faith flourished in former ages. My purpose is (if the Lord will) to gather vp such Antiquities though they be scattered and almost lost in these old worme eaten Ma∣nuscripts wherein they lye buried, which as Gods pro∣uidence hath deliuered from the force and fury of the in∣quisitors fire, so it is al Chri∣stians duties to preserue them to posterity. I haue here begun with a Handfull, or rather a Hartfull
of holy prayers & meditati∣ons worthy to be worne in the hand, and borne in the heart of euery Christian, by which it may euidently ap∣peare that the faith and Re∣ligion of the former ages, foure & fiue hundred yeares ago, was euen the same by which we looke to bee saued at this day. Let this haue leaue (right Honorable) to come abroad out of the corners of obscu∣rity, into publicke view, in the light & lustre of your re∣nowned name, who are knowne to bee a reuerencer of Antiquity, a Mecaenas of learning, a practiser of piety, an enemy to the idolatry,
superstitions, ambitious pra∣ctises, traiterous deuices, and Machiauellian plots of Ie∣suites: and a detester of such especially, who vnder a pretence of Religion, doe cloake and conuey impieties against God, and against his annointed. The God of heauen con∣firme that blessed worke of his in your Lordship more & more, to the glory of his name, the benefite of this Realme, and to your owne saluation in Christ Iesus: So praieth Your Lordships deuoted in Christ, W. CRASHAW.

De Deo Patre, pia, & ortho∣doxa Confessio. A , & , Deus, Hely, Hely, Deus meus. Cuius virtus, totum posse: Cuius sensus: totum nosse. Cuius esse, summum bonum: Cuius opus, quicquid bonum. Super cuncta▪ subter cuncta: Extra cuncta, intra cuncta. Super cuncta, nec elatus, Subter cuncta, nec substratus.
Extra cuncta, nec exculsus, Intra cuncta, nec inclusus. Super totus, presidendo, Subter totus, stustinendo. Extra totus complectendo, Intra totus es implendo. Super nullo sustentaris, Subter nullo fatigaris. Extra nusquam dilataris, Intra nunquam coarctaris. Mundum mouens non moueris, Locum tenens non teneris.
Tempus mutans, non mutaris, Vaga firmans non vagaris. Vis externa vel necesse, Non alternat tuum esse. Heri nostrum cras & pridem, Semper tibi nunc & idem. Tuum decus hodiernum, Indiuisum sempiternum. Tu hoc totum prouidisti, Totum simul perfecisti. Ad exemplar summae mentis, Formam praebens elementis.
De Iesu Christo Deo & homine Confessio orthodoxa. NAte patri Coaequalis, Patri consubstantialis: Patris splendor & figura. Factor factus creatura. Carnem nostraminduisti, Causam nostram suscepisti. Sempiternus temporalis, Moriturus immortalis. Verus homo, verus Deus, Impermixtus homo Deus.
Patri compar Deitate, Minor carnis veritate. Hic assumptus est in Deum; Nec consumptus propter Deum: Non conuersus hîc in carnem, Nec minutus propter carnem. Deus pater tantum Dei, Virgo mater sed & Dei. In tam noua ligatura, Sic vtra{que} stat natura Ʋt conseruet quicquid erat, Facta quiddam quod non erat.
Noster iste mediator, Iste noster Cogislator. Circumcitus, Baptizatus, Crucifixis, tumulatus: Obdormiuit & descendit, Resurrexit & ascendit. Sic ad caelos eleuatus, Iudicabit iudicatus.
De eodem. QƲem nobis voluit Diuina potentia Natum, Quem natum suafecerunt, Miracula Notum. Quem notum plebeia Cruci Vult concio Fixum. Quem{que} crucifixum, Ʋoluit pia turba Sepultum, Hunc Natum, Notum, fixum, Terra{que} sepultum. Sustulit in summum, Diuina potentia Coelum.
De Sancto Spiritu Confessio Or∣thodoxa. PAracletus increatus, Ne{que} factus, ne{que} natus. Patri compar filio{que}, Sic procedit ab vtro{que}. Ne sit minor potestate, Vel discrotus qualitate. Quanti illi, tantus iste, Quales illi, talis iste. Ex qui illi, ex tunc iste, Quantum illi, tantum iste.
Pater alter sed gignendo. Natus alter, sed nascendo, Flamen ab his pracedendo, Tres sunt vnum subsistendo. Quis{que} trium plenus Deus, Non tres tamen Dij, sed Deus. In hoc Deo, Deo vero, Tres & vnum asseuero. Dans  vnitatem, Et personis trinitatem. In personis nulla prior, Nulla maior, nulla minor.
Ʋna{que} semper ipsa, Sic est constans at{que} fixa. Vt nec in se varietur, Nec in vllam transmutetur.
Conclusio cum deuotis∣sima Precatione. HAec est fides orthodoxa, Non hic error siue noxa. Sicut dico. sic & credo, Nec in prauam partem cedo. Inde veni bone Deus, Ne desperem quamuis reus. Reus mortis non despero, Sed in morte vitam quaero. Quo te placeam non pretendo, Nisi fidem quam defendo.
Fidem vides hac imploro, Leua fascem quo laboro. Per hoc sacrum cataplasma, Conualescat agrum plasma. Extra portem iam delatum, Iamiam faetens, tumulatum. Vitta ligat, lapis vrget, Sed si iubes, hic resurget: Iube, lapis reuoluetur, Iube, vitta disrumpetur. Exiturus nescit mor as, Si tu clamas, Exi for as.
In hoe Salo mea Ratis, Infestatur à Pyratis. Hinc assultus, inde fluctus, Hinc & inde mors & luctus. Sed tu bone Nauta veni, Post me ventos mare leni. Fac abscedant hi pyratae, Duc ad portum salua Rate. In faecunda mea ficus, Cuius ramus, ramus siccus. Incidetur, incendetur, Si promulgas quod meretur.
Sed hoc anno dimittatur, Stercoretur fodiatur. Quod sinec dum respondebit, Flens haec dico, tunc ardebit. Vetus hostis in me furit, Aquis mersat flammis vrit. Inde languens & afflictus, Tibi soli sum relictus. Vt hic hostis euanescat, Vt infirmus conualescat. Tu virtutem ieiunandi, Des infirmo, des orandi.
Per hac duo (Christo teste) Liberabor ab hoc peste. Ab hoc peste solue mentem, Fac deuotum, penitentem. Da timorem quo proiecto, De salute nil coniecto: Da spem, fidem, charitatem, Da discretam pietatem, Da contemptum terrenorum, Appetitum supernorum. Totum Deus in te spero, Deus es, te totum quaero.
Tu laus mea, meum bonum, Mea cuncta tuum donum. Tu solamen in labore, Medicamen in languere. Tu in luctu mea lyra, Tu lenimen es in ira. Tu in arcto liberator, Tu in lapsu releuator. Mecum perstas in labore, Spem conseruas in dolore. Si quis laedit tu rependis, Si minatur tu defendis.
Quod est anceps tu dissoluis, Quod tegendum tu inuoluis. Tu intrare me non sinas, Infernales officinas. Vbi maeror, vbi metus, vbi faetor, vbi fletus. Vbi probra deteguntur, Vbi rei confunduntur: Vbi tortor semper caedens: Ʋbi vermis semper edens: Vbi totum hoe perenne, Procul sit haec mors gehennae.
Me reccptet Syon illa, Syon Dauid vrbs tranquilla. Cuius faber Auctor lucis, Cuius portae, lignum Crucis: Cuius claues lingua Iesu, Cuius ciues sine metu: Cuius muri lapis viuus Cuius custos rex festiuus: In hac vrbe lux solemnis: Ver aeternum, pax perennis: In hac odor implens Caelos, In hac semper dulce melos:
Non est ibi corruptela, Non defectus, non quaerela▪ Non minuti, non deformes, Omnes Christo sunt conformes. Vrbs caelestis, vrbs beata, Supra petram collocata: Ʋrbs in portu satis tuto. De longinquo te saluto: Te saluto, te suspiro, Te affecto, te requiro, Quantum tui gratulentur? Quam festiue conuiuentur?
Quis affectus eos stringat? Aut quae gemam muros pingat? Quis chalcedon, quis Iacincthus? Norunt illi qui sunt intus, In plateis huius vrbis, Sociatus pijs turbis. Cum Iob, Moses, & Elia, Pium cantem alleluiah. Amen.
Meditatio pijssima, de hominis miseria, et Dei miserecordia, vna cum deuota precatione. Vt Iucundas, Ceruus vndas, Estuans desiderat: Sic ad Deum, Fontem verum, Mens fidelis properat, Sicut ciui, Fortis viui Prebent refrigerium: Ita menti, Sitienti Deus est remedium.
Quantis bonis, super bonis, eruos tuos domine: sese laedit, qui recedit A superno lumine. Vitam laetam & quietam, Qui te quaerit reperit, sed laborem & dolorem, Metit qui te deserit. Pacem donas, & coronas, His qui tecum militant: Cunctalaeta sine meta, His qui tecum habitant.
Heu quam vana Mens humana, Lusione falleris? Cum te curis, Nocituris, Imprudenter ingeris. Cur non caues, Lapsus graues, Quos persuadet proditor? Nec affectas Vias rectas, Quas ostendit conditor. Resipiscas at{que} discas Cuius sis originis: Ʋbi degis, cuius legis, Cuius sis & ordinis,
Ne te spenes, Sed discernes Ho mo gemma regia: Te perpende & attende Qua sis factus gratia. Recordare, Quis, & quare Sis a deo conditus: Cuius haeres. Nunc maneres. Si fuisses subditus. O Mortalis, Quantis malis Meruisti affici Cum Auctori, & doctori Noluisti subijci.
Sed maiores Sunt dolores, Infernalis carceris Quo mittendus Et torquendus, Es, si male vixeris. Cui mundus, Est iucundus, Suam perdit animam: Prore leui, At{que} breui, Vitam perdit optimā. Ergo caue, Ne tam suaue Iugū spernens domini: Et abiecta Legerecta, Seruias libidini.
Si sint plagae, Curam age Vt curentur citius: Ne secrescant Et putrescant, Pergas in deterius. Ne desperes, Nam cohaeres, Christi esse poteris: Si carnales, Quantum vales, Affectus excluseris. Si formidas, Ne diffidas, Sed medelam postula: Noxam plange, Corpus ange, Dilue piacula.
Siviuorum, Et funclorum, Christum times Iudicem: Debes scire, Quod perire, Non vult suum supplicem. Preces funde, pectus tunde, Flendo cor humilia: Penitenti, Et gementi. Non negatur venia. Exorando, Et laudando, Iesum Christum memora: Nam delere Potest vere, Quaecun{que} facinora.
Et si quando, Te temptando Durus serpens laeserit: Suspiranti, Et oranti, Iesus Christus aderit: Quod si forte Mortis portae, Te vicinum senseris, Crede tamen, Quod iuuamen, Per eum receperis, Hunc require Qui lenire Solet corda tristium: Certus esto Quod est presto, Votis se precantium.
Ipse multos, iam sepultos Fecit reuiuiscere; Hic auersos, Et subuersos Potest Deo iungere, Ipsum ama, Ad hunc clama, Mentem tuam eleuae Ʋt sustentet, Et presentet. Te ad caeli gaudia. Ipsum Cole Ʋt de mole Criminum te liberet: Hunc appella Ne procella Vitiorum superet.
Ipsum posco, Quem cognosco, Posse prorsus omnia: Vt euellat, Et repellat, Cuncta quae sunt noxia. Ipse donet, Ʋt quod monet Eius verbum faciam: Ʋt finita, Carnis vita, Laetus hunc aspiciam: Pater Deus, Fili Deus, Deus alma charitas, Per eterna, Nos guberna, Secla, Deus Trinitas.
An Orthodoxall Confession of God the Father. FIrst and last one God diuine, All mens God as well as mine. In thy vertue all things framing, In thy knowledge all containing. In thine essence chiefest good, Working all what e're is good. All supporting, all excelling, Without all, yet in all dwelling. All supporting vndeiected, All excelling vnaffected.
Without all, yet not excluded, In all, neuer yet included. Ouer all in Domination, Vnder all in sustentation. Comprehending all without thee, Filling all things round about thee. Nothing vnder thee can raise thee, Nought aboue thee can debase thee. Nought without giues thee dimension, Nought within giues thee extension. Mouing all, thy selfe abiding, Placed without circumscribing.
Changing time, thy selfe most stable, Varying all, Inuariable. Force, necessity, nor art, Alter thee in any part. Time past, present, and to come, Are one with thee, both all and some. All the glory now thou hast. Vndiminisht aye must last. Onely thou art all foreseeing, Onely giuing all their being. As thy wisedome did foreshow, Thou framd'st the elements below.
A holy and orthodoxall Confes∣sion of God the Son, Iesus Christ the Sauiour of Mankind. SOnne, thy Fathers peere in all, with him Consubstantiall. His figure and his splendor pure, Creator, made a creature. Thou our humane flesh putst on, Thou our cause hast vndergon. Temporall, yet time defying, Euer liuing, yet once dying. God and man without illusion, Both in one without confusion.
Thy Fathers like in Deity, But not in fleshlie verity. God humanity assuming, The same preseruing, not consuming The Godhead in this vnion yet, Of his Godhead lost no whit. God to God, and not to'th other▪ Was Father, but Mary to both was mo∣ther Thus both natures kept their station, In this wonderous Combination. Preseruing in the Essence true What was, and thence producing new.
This our Mediator is, Our leader to the land of blisse. Circumcis'd babtis'd by Iohn, Suffered, buried, and vpon, The third day: whence he had descended, He rose, and so to heauen ascended. Whence he shall come, when time doth cal (Tho Iudg'd himselfe) to iudge vs all.
Of Christ againe. HE whom Gods power for mankind would haue borne, whom borne his miracles proclaimed haue, Who thus proclaim'd vpon a crosse was torne, To whom thus torne, the godly buriall gaue: This borne, proclaimed, torne Entombed King, God power againe, to heauenly blisse did bring:
A true and orthodoxall Confession of the holy Ghost. SPirit vncreated euer, Neuer made, begotten neuer. From the persons two proceeding, Full their equall, not exceeding. Not preferring them in Deity, Nor seuerall from them in quality. In quantity all three combine, In quality alike Diuine. With the Father and the Sunne, Neuer ending nor begun.
One is Father, for he begot, The Sonne one borne, all men wot From these the spirit proceeds alone, Thus one is three, and three are one. Each of these is God truly, Yet still but one, and not Gods three But in this Deity, I asseuer, A Trinity vnited euer. In the substance is full vnity, In the persons perfect Trinity: But, in these that I haue reckoned, None in power is first or second.
But allas one we must adore, Fixed and firme for euermore. Nor in selfe for euer changed, Nor from it selfe at all estranged.
The conclusion with a deuour and holy prayer. THis is Christian faith vnfained, Orthodoxall, true, vnstained: As I teach all vnderstand; Yeelding vnto neither hand. And in this my soules defence, Reiect me not for mine offence: Though deaths slaue, yet desperation I fly, in death, to seeke saluation I haue no meane, thy loue to gaine, But this faith which I maintaine
This thou seest, nor will I cease, By this to beg for a release. Let this sacred salue be bound, Vppon my sores to make them sound. Though man be carried forth, and lying In his graue, and putrifying: Bound and hid from mortall eyes, Yet if thou bid, he must arise: At thy will the graue will open At thy will his bounds are broken. And forth he comes, without delay; If thou but once bid come away:
In this sea of dread and doubt, My poore barke is tost about; With stormes and pirates farre and wide, Death and woes on euery side. Come thou steeresman euer blest, Calme these winds, that me molest: Chase these ruthlesse Pyrates hence, And shew me some safe residence. My tree is fruitlesse, dry and dead, All the bowes are withered. Downe it must, and to the fire If desert haue his due hire.
But spare it (Lord) another yeare, With manuring it may beare. If it then, be dead and dry, Burne it, alas, what remedy. Mine old foe assaults me sore, With fire and water, more and more. Poore I, of all my strength bereft, Onely vnto thee am left. That my foe may hence be chased, And I from ruines clawes released. Lord vouchsafe me euery day, Strength to fast, and faith to pray.
These two meanes thy selfe hast taught, To bring temptations force to nought. Lord free my soule from sinnes infection, By repentances direction. Be thy feare in me abiding My soule to true saluation guiding Grant me faith (Lord) hope and loue Zeale of heauen and things aboue Tcach me prize the world at nought, On thy blisse be all my thought. All my hopes on thee I found, In whom all good things abound.
Thou art all my dignity, All I haue I haue from thee. Thou art my comfort in distresse, Thou art my cure, in heauinesse Thou art my musicke in my sadnesse, Thou art my medicine in my madnesse Thou my freedome from my thrall, Thou my rayser from my fall. In my labour thou releiues me, Thou reformes what euer grieues me. All my wrongs thy hand reuengeth, And from hurt my soule defendeth
Thou my deepest doubts reuealest, Thou my secret faults concealest. Oh doe thou stay my feete from treading In paths to hell and horror leading: Where eternall torment dwels, With feares, & teares & loathsome smels. Where mans deepest shame is sounded, And the guilty still confounded. Where the scourge for euer beateth, And the worme that alwaies eateth. Where all those endlesse do remaine, Lord preserue vs from this paine.
In Syon lodge me (Lord) for pitty Syon Dauids kingly Cittie. Built by him that's only good, Whose gates are of the crosses wood. Whose keies are Christs vndoubted word, Whose dwellers feare none but the Lord. Whose wals are stone, strong, quicke and bright, Whose keeper is the Lord of light. Here the light doth neuer cease Endlesse spring and endlesse peace Here is musicke, heauen filling, Swetnesse euermore distilling.
Here is neither spot nor taint, No defect, nor no complaint. No man crooked, great nor small, But to Christ conformed all. Blessed towne, diuinely graced, On a rocke so strongly placed. Seated sure from feare of warre: I salute thy wals from farre. Thee I see, and thee I long for, Thee I seeke, and thee I groane for. O what ioy thy dwellers tast, All in pleasures first and last?
What full enioying blisse Diuine? What Iewels on thy wals do shine? Rubie, Iacincth, Chalcedon, Knowne to them within alone. In this glorious Company In the streetes of Syon, I With Iob, Moses, and Eliah, Will sing the heauenly Alleluiah Amen.
A holy meditation of mans mi sery, and Gods mercy, together with a deuout prayer. VVIth longing cheere, The thirsty Deere. do seeke the brooke: In such a kind, The faithful minde, For God doth looke. And as the springs, Refreshment brings, in drought and sweat, So God doth coole, The thirsty soule in all her heate.
O Lord what floods of glorious goods, dost thou bestow, On those that be thine, blest is he that well doth know Eternall blisse, His guerdon is that Iesus maketh His rest, but he Reapes mysery that him forsaketh. Thou makest them glorious And victorious, Who serue thee well In endlesse ioy From all annoy with thee they dwell.
But oh Humanity, With how great vanity, art thou betost? To dote in care, On things that are, so quickly lost? Why dost thou yeeld, And leaue the field, to sinnes inuasions? Not well respecting, But ill reiecting, thy Gods perswasions? Open thine eies, And well aduise, of whence thou art: Thy life, thy birth, Thy state, thy worth, obserue each part.
From carelesnesse Thy selfe still blesse, O man Gods Iewell: How he placed thee, And graced thee obserue and view well. To what intent, Hath God thee sent, obserue with care: To whom (but pride Drew thee aside) thou hadst bene heyre. O mortall sonne, Affliction is thy due hire: That broke the band Of Gods commande, through vaine desire.
But oh take heed, Those paines exceed, that rule in hell: Whose fire so cruell, Hath those for fuell, that liue not well. The man that ioyes In worldly toyes, his soule orethrowes: Respecting nought, What Christ hath bought full deere God knowes. Then neuer grudge, If God thee iudge, his yoke to beare: Let not lust draw, Thee from his law, But hold it deere.
And soone apply His remedy, vnto thy sore: Least it increase, To worse disease, and plague thee more. Doe not dispaire, Thou maist be heire, with Christ in ioy: By casting out, Corruptions roote, thy soules annoy. Still feare thou must, But not distrust, and beg thy cure: For errours weepe, Thy body keepe lowly and pure:
If to thy feare, Thy iudge appeare with angry face: Know he will loose, Not one of those, that beg his grace. Pray without rest, And knock thy brest, humble thy minde: All that bewaile, Their errours fraile, haue pardon sign'd. And do not spare, In hymme and prayer, Iesus to praise: For mercy still, Is at his will, at all assayes.
And when the diuell, The Prince of euill, attempteth thee, Then if thou pray Christ will not stay to set thee free. All be thou were, To death most neere, yet still be sure: And vnderstand That his high hand, containes thy cure. Be he thy quest, That giues all rest, from restlesse woes: Who so adore, And him implore, shall come to those,
For many an one, Dead long agon, hath he reuiued: And saued more That were before of grace depriued, Be all thy loue, On God aboue, Lift vp thy spirit: That thou maist tast The Saints repast, through his sole merit. And honour him, That he from sinne, may thee deliuer, That sinnes increase In thee may cease, in prayer perseuer.
On him I call, That all in all hath in his power: Against all harme, Be he myne arme my shield my towre. And this liues length Vouchsafe vs strength to keepe his hest: That at our end Wee may ascend, To endlesse rest. Amen.
Here followeth the means and manner how our forefathers in the time of Po∣pery prepared themselues and others to dye, consisting first of the confession of their faith, and secondly of the prayers which were made by them, & for them in their last sicknesse, by which it may appeare that though they were misled by the crafty Romish Clergy, in diuers er∣rours and superstions, yet in the great point of the meanes of saluation, they were of our religion and were saued by it.
INterrogationes quae fieri debent morituris dum ad∣huc vsum rationis habent, & loquendi, vt si quis minus dispo∣situs fuerit ad moriendum, de me∣liori informetur at{que} in eodem con∣fortetur. Illae autem interrogationes debent fieri, fecundum Anselmum Episcopum hoc modo, Primos queratur sic. Frater 1 laetaris quod in fide Christi morieris. Ille respondet, Etiam. Frater 2 penitet te non tam bene vixisse sicut debuisses? Respondeat etiam.
Frater, habes animum emendan∣di si spatium viuendi haberes? Respon. Etiam. Frater credis te non posse nisi per Christi mortem saluari? Resp. Etiam. Credis quod prote mortuus est Dominus Iesus Christus fillius Dei? Resp. Etiam, Agis ei gratias ex toto corde de hoc. Respo. Etiam. Age ergo ei (dum superest in te anima) semper gratias, & in hac so∣la morte, fiduciam tuam constitue: in nulla alia re fiduciam habe, huic mortite totum committe, hac sola te totum contege: totum immisce
te in hac morte, totum confige, in hac morte te totum inuolue. Et si dominus Deus voluerit tu iu∣dicare, dic, Domine, mortem Do∣mini mei Iesu Christi obijcio inter me & iudiciū tuum aliter tecum non contendam. Et si tibi dixerit Deus, quia pec∣cator es. dic, Domine mortem Domini mei Iesu Christi pono inter te & peccata mea: si dixerit tibi quod meruisti damnationem, dic: Domine, mortem Domini mei Iesu Christi obtendo inter te, & mala merita mea, Ipsum{que}, & dignissimae, passionis meritum offero pro me∣rito quod ego debuissem habere, & (heu) hon habeo: Si dixerit deus quod tibi est iratus,
die, Domine mortem Domini mei Iesu Christi pono inter me & iram tuam. Deinde dicat ter, In manus tuas Domine commendo spiritum meum, et si id ipsum non potest loqui dicat conuentus vel astantes, In ma∣nus tuas domine commendamus spi∣ritum eius. Et securus moritur, nec videbit mortem in eternum. Et in alio vetusto codice. SEquntur signa sex quibus homo potest confidere de salute. 1 Si credit ea quae sunt Christi∣anae fidei quantum ad omnia ab Ec∣clesia determinata.
2 Si gaudet & laetetur quod in fide Christi morietur. 3 Si cognoscat se grauiter De∣um offendisse. 4 Si dolet se tam grauiter De∣um offendisse. 5 Si proponit a peccatis abstine∣re si vixerit. 6 Si credit & sperat venire ad salutē aeternam non proprijs meritis, sed Iesu Christi. Et dicit Anselmus quod hae sex questiones proponi debent homi∣ni costituto in mortis articulo, & addit. Deinde dicatur infirmo: si Sa∣than tibi obijciat aliquid, opponas merita Christi inter te & ipsū, & his peractis sine dubio saluabitur.
Ista consolatio & preparatio ad mortem, in vetustis codicibus ascribitur Anselmo, qui vixit ante annos 500, in ipsa adulta fere ae∣tate Papismi. Si vero dubitaret quis, quomodo patres nostri in hisce posterioribus, multo{que} pe∣ioribus temporibus salutem ae∣ternā possent adipisci, grassante Papismo & vigente potestate tenebrarum. Respondeo eandem fere pre∣parationem, & intterrogationes fuisse in vsu & aestimatione, In densissimis Papismi tenebris: pessimo nimirum illo tempore Concilij Constantiensis ante an∣nos nimirum 200. sic enim repe∣rio scriptum in alio vetusto codi∣ce, multis abhinc annis descripto.
Omnis Christianus siue se∣cularis, fiue regularis modo sub∣sequenti de sua salute in∣quirendus et infor∣mandus est. 1 CRedis omnes principales ar∣ticulos fidei, & insuper toti sacrae Scripturae per omnia, secun∣dum sanctorum Catholicorum & orthodoxorum, sanctae Ecclesiae do∣ctorum expositionem & detestatis omnes hereses & errores at{que} super∣stitiones, ab Ecclesia reprobatas: ac laetaris insuper quod in fide Christi, ac vnitate matris Eccelsiae, ac obedi∣entia morieris? 2 Cognoscis te Creatorem tuum saepe & multipliciter, at{que} grauiter offendisse.
3 Doles ex toto corde de omni∣bus peccatis contra Dei maiestatem amorem & benignitatem, de malis commissis & bonis omissis, & grati∣as neglectis, non solum timore mor∣tis conturbatus, vel paenae cuiuscū{que} sed magis ex amore Dei? 4 Petis frater omnibus istis ve∣niam a Iesu Christo, optans per illum cor tuum illuminari ad cognitionem obliquorum, vt de illis valeas speci∣aliter paenitere? 5 Proponis te vereaciter velle emē∣dare si supervixeris, et nunquā plus mortaliter peccare scienter, sed
potius omnia quanticunque chara dimittere imo etiam vitam carna∣lem perdere antequam Deum plus velles offendere. 6 Rogas insuper Deum vt det tibi gratiam hoc propositum continu∣andi & non recidiuandi. 7 Indulges, ex toto corde, omnibus qui vnquam aliquid nocumentum verbo, vel facto tibi intulerunt, vel aliquo modo offenderunt, ob amorem & venerationem Domini tui Iesu Christi, a quo & tu veniam speras▪ Petis etiam fideliter indulgeri & remitti tibi ab ijs quos tu offendisti quouis modo? 8 Vis ablata restitui integraliter in quantū teneris iuxta tuarum fa∣cultatum valorem etiam vs{que} ad omnium bonorum tuorum cssionem inclusiue, vbi alias, satisfactio fieri non valeret?
9 Credis quod parte mortuus sit Christus & quod aliter saluari non potes, nisi per meritum passionis Domini nostri Iesu Christi: & agis etiam de hoc Deo gratias ex corde, quantum valeas. Quicun{que} autem ad praedictas interrogationes ex conscientia bo∣na, & fide non ficta, vere poterit affirmatiue respondere, satis eui∣dens argumentum salutis habet, si sic decesserit, quod de numero sal∣uandorum erit.
QVestions to bee pro∣pounded to sicke per∣sons, whilst they haue the vse of reason, and power to speake, to the end that if any be not so well disposed to dye, he may bee better infor∣med and prepared. And the questions be these, according to Anselme the reuerend Bishop. 1 Let him be asked thus, Brother dost thou reioyce that thou shalt dye in the faith of Christ? Ans. I do. 2 Brother, dost thou sorrow and grieue, for that thou hast not liued so well as thou oughtest? The answere, I do
Brother: hast thou a hearty purpose to liue better, if God giue thee time to liue? Ans. I haue. Brother dost thou beleeue that thou cannot be saued, but by the death of Christ? Ans. I do. Dost thou beleeue that Iesus Christ the Sonne of God dyed for thee? Ans. I do. Dost thou giue thankes to God therefore from thy whole heart? Ans. I do. Well then good brother, whilst thy soule is yet in thy body giue him hearty thankes▪ and settle all thy assurance vpon his death alone: haue no confidence in any thing else: trust thy selfe wholly to his passion: couer thy selfe wholly with it, fasten thy whole
selfe on his crosse: cast thy whole selfe into this sea. And if thy Lord God say hee will iudge thee; answere thou, Lord I obiect the death of my Lord Iesus Christ betwixt me & thy iudgement, otherwise I will not contend with thee. And if God say to thee thou art a sinner, answer: Lord it is so, but I set the death of my Lord Iesus Christ betwixt thee & my sinnes: If hee say that thou hast deserued damnation, answer. It is true Lord, but I place the death and merits of my Lord Iesus Christ betwixt thee and my ill deseruings: and I offer vp him & the most worthy merites of his passion, for the merits which I should haue had, but (alas) haue not. If the Lord say further that he is angry with thee, answere
him, Lord thou hast cause, but I set the death and suffrings of my Lord Iesus Christ, betwixt thy wrath and my soule. Then let him say thrise: Lord into thy hands I commend my spi∣rit. And if he be so weake hee cannot, then let the company who stand by say, Lord into thy hands we commend his soule. He that doth thus is safe and secure, for, he shall neuer tast of eternall death. Also in another old booke I find this written. THese be the six signes vpon which a man may rest confi∣dent of his saluation. 1 If he beleeue the Articles of Christian faith, as many as are determined by the Churche.
2 If he reioyce to dye in the faith of Christ. 3 If hee know that hee hath grieuously offended God. 4 If he bee heartily sorry for it. 5 If he resolue to forsake his sinnes, if God giue him life. 6 If he hope and beleeue to come to eternall saluation, not by his owne merits, but by the merits of Iesus Christ. And Anselme saith that these six questions are to bee asked of euery one at the time of his death, and saith further thus. Then say to the sicke person: if Sathan obiect any thing against thee, oppose thou the merits of Christ betwixt thee and him: and thus without all doubt hee shall be saued.
This consolation of the sicke and preparation to their death is in an∣cient Copies ascribed to Anselme, who liued more then 500 yeares a∣goe, euen when Popery was almost growne to perfect age: Now if any man make question how our fathers were saued in these later and worse times, when Popery preuailed in a greater measure; I answere that e∣uen almost the same preparation, and same questions, were vsed long after Anselme, euen in the deepest darke∣nesse of Popery: For in the most euill time about the Councell of Con∣stance, some two hundred years ago, Thus I finde it written in ancient Booke, and it is ascribed to Gerson.
Euery Christian whether se∣cular or regular is thus to be exa∣mined and informed in his sicknesse touching his saluation. 1 DOest thou beleeue all the principal articles of faith, and all that is contained in the whole body of holy Scripture, according to the exposition of the Catholicke and orthodoxall Doctors of the holy Church: and dost thou detest all heresies and errours and superstitions, con∣demned or reproued by the Church: and art thou glad that thou dyest in the faith of Christ, and vnity and obedience of thy Mother the Church. 2 Doest thou know and con∣fesse that thou hast many wayes and grieuously offended thy God and Creator.
3 Dost thou sorrow from thy whole heart for all thy sins com∣mitted against Gods Maiesty his loue and mercy, art thou truely sorrowful for the euils that thou hast committed, and the good that thou hast omitted, and the grace thou hast neglected, and art thou agreiued, not so much for feare of death, or any punish∣ment, as for that loue which thou oughtest to beare towards God? 4 Doest thou beg pardon for all these thy sins of Iesus Christ, desiring that by him thy heart may be enlightned, truely to see and know thy sins, that so thou maist particularly and more seri∣ously repent of them? 5 Doest thou propound and resolue truly to amend thy life (if so be thou liue) and neuer here∣after to sinne so againe, but ra∣ther
to loose any thing how deere soeuer vnto thee, yea euen life it selfe, then to offend thy God againe? 6 Doest thou also desire of God, grace to continue in this purpose, that thou maist not fall againe? 7 Doest thou forgiue from thy whole heart all that haue done thee any wrong in word or deed, for the loue of Christ Iesus thy Lord and Sauiour, and as thou hopest for pardon from him: and doest thou hartily de∣sire to bee forgiuen of all men, whom thou hast any way offen∣ded? 8 Wilt thou that there be ful restitution made according to thy power, yea though it should extend to thy whole estate, if o∣therwise there cannot bee satis∣faction made?
9 Doest thou beleeue that Christ dyed for thee, and that thou canst bee saued no other∣wise but by the merites of Iesus Christ: and doest thou giue God thankes for this from thy whole heart as much as thou art able. And whosoeuer can giue true answere to these questions affirmatiuely, out of a good conscience and faith not fay∣ned; It is an euident and suf∣ficient testimony of saluati∣on, and let him not doubt but if he so depart, hee is one of them that shall be saued.
Behold heere good Reader our Religion practised in the most misty times of Popery: behold heere the true, holy, Catholike and ancient way to heauen: Namely, By Christ and his merits alone. Heere is no tru∣sting on mans merits, either our own or others: Here is no mention of Ag∣nus deis, or Wodden Crucifixes, He is not bid to trust in the prayers, suffrages, requiems, dirges, Mas∣ses, Trentals, or other obsequies that shall be sayd for him after his depar∣ture. He is sent to no Angell, no nor to the Virgin Mary, for matter of Saluation: Nay all are excluded, & Christs death alone, euen it alone, is made the meanes of his Saluation, And the makers heereof were so re∣solute, and zealous in this point, that they vse such variety of words, as though they could not sufficiently ex∣presse the excellency and the nece∣cessity of cleauing to Christ alone
in the matter of saluation. And if any man suspect that this is but deuised by vs, and falsely fathered vpon Antiquity, let him know that not onely we haue the an∣cient Copies, whose age will speake for themselues, but euen the better sort of Papists, that be learned, doe know this well enough. A learned Papist of this ageGasper v∣lenbergius. in lib. de Causis. Cau∣sa 14. pag. 462. editio∣nis Colon. 1589. writeth, that in a Church in Co∣laine this very booke is extant (Manuscript) and that hee hath seene it, and that this manner of comforting the sicke was vsed in for∣mer ages, and confesseth that it con∣taines the very treasure & kernel of Christian Religion, and saith fur∣ther that this manner was vsed not in Germany onely, but ouer all the Christian world: Indeed to the Ie∣suits I confesse, this is held a ridicu∣lous manner of comforting the sicke, (such a spirit possesseth them:)
Thus doth Gretzer their Champi∣on, flout vs Lutherans (as he cals vs) for thus doing. The Lutherans (saith hee) doIae. Gretze∣rus in refutat Leyseri de histor. Ord. Iesuit. thus comfort their sick. Relicks, Crucifixes, Agnus deis, and such matters are but dead things, and nothing worth, the Scripture hath not a word of them: it is therefore very vngodly to trust in them; but God is our hope, and God is our strength trust in him, &c. On this wise fashion do these godly comforters comfort their sicke persons. Thus in the Iesuites iudgement it is but a seely course to trust in Gods mercy, and Christs merits, in points of saluation: Hereby it may be discerned of what spirit they are. But let them mocke vs, as long as with vs they mocke the Scriptures, Antiquity, and the better sort of their owne side, for we appeale to this that
hath bene said, whether this manner of comforting the sicke were not in vse long before Luther was borne: Now if any obiect that in the same bookes there is mention of the Crucifixe, and that it is appointed to be in the presence of the sicke per∣son: I answere it is true, but not that he should worship it, (as now the Ie∣suits teach, and all the approuedGregori. de valent. Gret∣zerus, Vas∣quez. Romish writers) but that it may put him in mind of Christ, which though it be a needlesse superstition, yet is it not that impiety and idolatrie, which now at this day is practised & main∣tained in the Romish Church, and my purpose is not to discharge those times, nor our forefathers in those times of errours, and superstitions, but of the idolatrie, impietie, and blasphemy of the present Church of Rome. And the same answer is al∣so to bee giuen to another obiection. That in the same booke there are
praiers to the Saints and Angels: It is so, and from that errour those ages cannot bee cleered: but with all let vs still obserue that those praiers are not to helpe them in matters of saluation, (as are many blasphemous praiers now vsuall in Popery:) and that sin in those mistie times (being a sinne of ignorance) no doubt was pardoned vnto them in the mercy of God, seeing that for their reconcilia∣tion with God, and eternall salua∣tion, they beleeued to attaine it one∣ly by the merits and passion of Iesus Christ. But let not vs feed on their infirmities, but louingly passe by them, and let this content and com∣fort vs, that their meanes of salua∣tion which they vsed and trusted vn∣to, is the same with ours at this day: for better testimony whereof, let vs set downe some of their praiers, be∣ing such as the best Christian may vse at this day with much comfort.
Certaine Praiers vsed by our Fore-fathers in the darkest times of Popery, in the time of a mans sicke∣nesse: some to bee made for the sicke, and some by the sicke person: gathered out of the same ancient books. When the sicke person feeles his strength to faile, then let him commend his soule to God in this Praier.
O summa Deitas, immensa, cle∣mentissima, at{que} gloriosissima Trini∣tas, summa dilectio, amor & chari∣tas, miserere mei miserrimi peccato∣ris: tibi enim commendo spiritum meum. Deus meus pijssimus, pater miserecordiarum, miserecordiam fac huic pauperculae Creaturae, & in vltima necessitate mea succurreiam Domine indigenti animae, & desola∣tae, vt non a canibus infernalibus de∣uoretur. O dulcissime, & amantissime Domine Iesu Christi, fili Dei viui, ob honorem, & virtutem beatissimae passionis, iube me recepi inter nume∣rum electorum tuorum:
Saluator & Redemptor meus, reddo me totū tibi: vt me non renuas â venia, nec repellas à gloria tua. At ô Domine Iesu Christe, paradisum tuum postulo, non ob valorem meri∣torum meorū, cum sum puluis & ci∣nis, & peccator miserrimus sed in virtute & efficacia, tuae sanctissimae passionis, per quam me miserimū re∣dimere voluisti, & mihi paradisum tuo pretioso sanguine emere digna∣tus es. Igitur per illam amaritudi∣nem quam pro me sustinere voluisti in Cruce, maxime in illa hora quan∣do sanctissima anima tua egressa est de corpore tuo, miserere animae meae in egressu suo.
Deinde dicat pluries diripuisti Domine vincula mea, tibi sacrifica∣bo hostiam laudis. Deinde cum ipse visum loquelae amiserit, orationes sequentes dicantur super infirmum laborantem ab aliquo presentium, si ad∣huc superuiuit. QVaesumus, miserecors pater, se∣cundum multitudinem mise∣rationum tuarum, respice propitius super hunc famulū tuum, fratrem nostrum, remissionem omnium pecca∣torum suorum tota cordis confessione poscentem: Exaudi deprecantes, & renoua in eo, pijssime pater, quicquid in eo terrena fragilitate corruptum
est, vel quicquid Diabolica fraude violatum est, & vnitati corporis Ec∣clesiae membrum redemptionis con∣grega. Miserere Domine gemituū suorum, miserere lachrimarum eius, & in habentem fiduciam nisi in mi∣serecordia tua ad tuae reconciliatio∣nis sacrameutum admitte. In ma∣nus igitur in extinguibilis miserecor∣diae tuae, pater sanctissime, cōmende∣mus spiritum famuli tui fratris no∣stri, secundū magnitudinem amoris quo se anima filij tui sanctissima in cruce tibi cōmendabit supplicater de∣precantes quatenus per illā inestima∣bilē diuinitatē quam tua diuina bo∣nitas in se totā traxit illam sanctis∣siman
animam, vt in hora vltima famuli tui, fratris nostri, suscipias in eodem amore spiritum eius. Et tu dulcissime redemptor, pijssi∣me Iesu, per illam lacrimabilem vo∣cem quam moriturus emisisti, cum pro nobis doloribus & laboribus pas∣sionis adeo consumptus es, vt te dere∣lictum à patre clamabas. Ne longe facias à famule tuo, fratre nostro, auxilium tuae miserationis in hora & in momento afflictionis animae suae prae defectione & consumptione spi∣rit us te inuocare in extrema hora mortis scire non valente: sed per tri∣umphum sanctae crucis & per salu∣tem
salutiferae passionis & amoro∣sae mortis tuae, cogitade eo cogitationes pacis, & nō afflictonis sed miserecor∣dissimae miserationis & cōsolationis: & libera eam de omnibus angustijs, erue eam a a tormentis sibi deputatis & perduc eam in requiē aeternum: O Domine Iesu Christe, qui redemisti nos precioso sanguine tuo, scribe in anima huius famuli tui vulnera tua pretioso sanguine tuo, vt discat in eis legere tuum dolorem & tuum a∣morem: dolorem contra omnes dolo∣res & paenas quas pro peccatis suis se timet meruisse: Amorem vt vnia∣tur tibi amore inuisibili, quo a te & omnibus electis tuis, nunquam possit in aeternum seperari:
Et fac cum Domine Iesu Christs participem sacratissimae incarnationis passionis, resurrectionis & ascenti∣onis tuae: fac eum participem sacrati∣ssimorū mysteriorum & sacramen∣torum tuorum: Fac eam participem omnium orationum ac benefactorum quae fuerunt in Ecclesia sancta tua. Fac eam participem omnium bene∣dictionum, gratiarum, & gaudio∣rum ominum electorum tuorum, ab initio mundi, & concede vt cum his omnibus in tuo conspectu gaudeat in aeternum: Domine qui orasti pro nobis in monte Oliueti, obsecra∣mus te vt multitudinē sanguinis et sudoris quem prae angustia tua copio∣sissime pro nobis effudisti, ostendere digneris & offerre deo patri omnipo∣tenti contra multitudinem omnium
peccatorum huius famuli tui fratris nostri, & libera cum in hac hora mortis suae ab omnibus paenis & an∣gustijs quas pro peccatis fuis timet se meruisse; salua animam eius in hac hora exitus sui, et aperi ei Ianuam vitae, & fact eam gaudere cum san∣ctis in gloria aeterna, per tua merita Domine Iesu Christe, qui cum Deo patre, & spiritu Sancto viuis & reg-Deus in secula. Cum autem eius vires deficient & animam emissurum videa∣tur, commendetur anima per aliquem astantium, hoc mo∣do.
Commendatio animae morientis. COmmendo te omnipotenti Deo (charissime frater) et ei, cuius es creatura committo: proficiscere anima Christiana de hoc misero mundo. In nomine Patris omni∣potentis qui te creauit. In nomi∣ne Iesu Christi filij eius qui pro te passus est. In nomine Spiritus San∣cti, qul in te fusus est. Egrediente aute animatua de corpore, splendi∣dus Angelorum caetus tibi occurrat, & omnium sanctorum caetus te ac∣cipiat:
appareat tibi mitis, & cle∣mens, Iesus Christus, qui inter assis∣tentes sibi te iugiter interesse de∣cernat, vt locus tuus in pace sit, & habitatio tua in Hierusalem coele∣sti: Ignores omnino quid horret in tenebris, quid stridet in flammis, quid cruciat in tormentis. Cedat ti∣bi nequissimus Sathan cum satelliti∣bus suis: nec in aduentu suo te vincat, sedcoram angelis dei contremiscat as in aterna noctis chaos immane diffu∣giat: at exurget Deus & dissipentur omnes inimici eius, sicut deficit fu∣mus ita deficiant. Iusti autem exul∣tentur,
& exultent in conspectu Dei: Confundantur igitur & erubescant ante te tar tareae legiones & ministri satanae iter tuum impedire non au∣deāt: Liberet te à cruciatu Christus qui pro te mori dignatus est, & con∣stituet te Christus filius Dei inter paradisi sui amena & semper viren∣tia, & i am inter oues suos verus te ille pastor agnoscat. Ille ab omni∣bus peccatis tuis absoluat, at{que} ad dextram in electorum suorum sorte te constituat, vt redemptorem tuum facie ad faciam videas & cōstitutum
agmina beatorum contemplationis diuinae gaudio potiaris in secula sae∣culonum. Amen.
Certaine Praiers vsed by our Fore-fathers in the darkest times of Popery, in the time of a mans sicke∣nesse: some to bee made for the sicke, and some by the sicke person: gathered out of the same ancient books. When the sicke person feeles his strength to faile, then let him commend his soule to God in this Praier.
O Most high and soueraigne God whose goodnesse and mercie is infinite: ô most glori∣ous Trinity, which art loue, and mercie, and goodnesse it selfe, haue mercy on me most misera∣ble sinner, for vnto thee, and vn∣to thy hands I commend my spirit: ô Lord, my most louing God, & father of mercies, shew thy mercy on me thy poore cre∣ature, and forsake mee not in my last neede, but stand with me Lord, and helpe my succourlesse soule, saue my poore and deso∣late soule, that it bee not deuou∣red of the infernall dogges. O most louing Lord, & sweet Sauiour Iesus Christ, the sonne of the liuing God, I beseech thee for the honor, and by the vertue of thy most blessed passion com∣mand that I may be receiued in∣to
the number of thy Saints, and seruants. O my Sauiour & my Redeemer I here yeeld vp my selfe wholly to thee, O grant mee thy grace and thy glory, vochsafe me par∣don of my sin, and giue me a por∣tion of thy glory. But ô my deere Lord, I chalenge not a place in heauen for any worthines of my owne merits, for I am but dust & ashes, & a most wretched finner: but for the vertue of thy most blessed passiō, by which thou did∣dest vouchsafe to redeeme mee miserable man, and to purchase heauē for me, euen with the price of thy precious bloud. I beseech thee therefore by thy most bles∣sed, & bitter passion, which thou sustainedst on the Crosse for me, especially in that houre whē thy blessed soule did leaue the body, that thou wouldest haue mercy on my poore soule at the time of my departure.
Then let him lift vp his heart with ioy and thanksgiuing, and say, Lord thou hast broken my bonds, therefore I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise. After, if his weaknesse grow so that hee loose the vse of his speech, let some of the by-stan∣ders say these prayers follow∣ing ouer him, or more if he liue so long. MErcifull God and Father wee beseech thee for the multitudes of thy mercies, look fauourably vpon this thy seruant (our deere brother) who with true and hearty confession seeks pardon of all his sinnes at the hand of thy mercies, O Lord heare vs for him, and we beseech thee for him, most holy father, to renew in his heart what euer is
corrupted by the frailty of his flesh, and restore that grace which the wily and malicious e∣nemy the diuell hath stolne out of his soule: O Lord recall him to the vnity of thy Church; in∣graft him into the body of thy soule. O Lord take pitty of the sighes and sobbes of his soule, and groanes of his heart, o Lord looke vpon his teares, gather them in thy bottle, and be good to him, who hath no hope, com∣fort nor confidence, but in thy mercy, and seale vp the assurance of his reconciliation with thee. O most holy Father we humbly commend the soule of this thy seruant, and our brother into the hands of thy vnmeasureable mercies, humbly beseeching thee, according to the greatnesse of that loue in which the blessed soule of thy sonne did commend
it selfe into thy holy hands, that for the worthinesse of that infi∣nite loue of thine, in which thou didst receiue that holy soule vn∣to thy selfe, thou wouldst vouch∣safe in this our brothers last houre, to receiue his poore soule also and make it partaker of the same loue. And thou most sweete Sauiour and most mercifull Lord Iesus, thou that dying on the crosse was so pressed with anguish and torments for vs, as made thee sound out that pittiful voyce vn∣to thy Father: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, we be∣seech thee estrange not thy selfe, and turne not away thy face frō thy seruant our brother, now in the houre of his soules affliction, when his strength faileth, and his spirits are so spent that he cannot cal vpon theee: heare vs O Lord:
heare vs for him, and for that thy glo∣rious victory in which thou didst tri∣umph on the crosse, & for thy preti∣ous passion and bitter death thinke of him the thoughts of mercy and not of iustice: shed thy mercies in his soule & speak cōfortably to his conscience, deliuer his soule out of all spirituall distresse, saue him frō the tormēts due vnto his deseruings, & bring him, for thy own merits sake, to eternal rest. O Lod Iesus Christ which didst redeem vs with thy precious bloud, write with thine own bloud, in the soule, and in∣graue thy wounds in the heart of this thy seruant, that in thē he may see & read thy doleful suffrings & thy sweet loue: thy sufferings that they may be effectual to rasome him frō those sor∣rows & torments which he hath meri∣ted by his sins: thy loue that it may v∣nite his heart to thee, in inuisible & in∣separable bonds, so as he may neuer be seperated frō, thee nor thy Saints, for euer and euer.
And Lord Iesus Christ we be∣seech thee make his soule parta∣ker of all the merits of thy most sacred incarnation, passion, re∣surrection, and ascention. Make him pertaker of the vertue of thy most blessed sacraments, and all thy holy mysteries. Make him pertaker of all the praiers & good deedes done in thy whole Church. Make him pertaker of al the blessings, graces, and com∣forts of all thy elect, and grant that with them all he may liue in thy presence for euermore. O Lord which powred out thy prayer for vs on the mount Oli∣uet, and sweat water and bloud, wee beseech thee, let that preci∣ous bloud of thine, which thou didst so aboundantly poure out for our saluation, let it bee pre∣sented and offered to thy father to stand against the multitude of
of the sinnes of this thy seruant, our brother: Lord be with him at his last houre, and then deliuer him from the anguish and tor∣ments which for his sins he may iustly feare: Graciously receiue his soule in the houre of his de∣parture: open the gate of hea∣uen vnto him, and giue him a portion with thy Saints in glory, for thy owne most glorious me∣rite, O Lord Iesus Christ, who with God the Father, and the holy Ghost, liuest and raignest one God for euermore, Amen. And when the sicke mans strength beginnes to faile, and the soule is ready to depart: then let the soule be commended to God by one of the by-standers on this manner.
The Commendation of the soule to be said at a mans death. I Heere commend thee to Al∣mighty God most deere bro∣ther, and I commit thee to him whose creature thou art. Go forth therefore O Christian soule, get thee gone out of this filthy world, go forth in the name of the Almighty Father who created thee, in the name of Iesus Christ, who dyed for thee, in the name of the holy Ghost who hath bene poured out vpon thee: And when thou (happy soule) art deliuered out of the prison of the body, the glorious quire of heauenly Angels meet thee, and the company of all ho∣ly Saintes entertaine thee: the lo∣uing
countenance and cheereful face of Iesus Christ shine vpon thee, a mercifull Iudge bee hee vnto thee, that thou maist haue sentence to sit for euer amongst his Saints, on his right hand: thy dwellings be in peace, and thy saluation in the heauenly Ierusa∣lem for euermore, farr be it from thee euer to feele or know how horrible the darknesse, how ter∣rible the flames, and how intol∣lerable the torments of hell are, Sathan and all his hellish guard be they confounded at thy pre∣sence, and if hee dare set vpon thee, victory and triumph be on thy side, shame and trembling fall vpon him from the presence of Gods Angels, and be hee ba∣nished into the blacke mists, and confused chaos of eternall dark∣nesse. But let the Lord arise and let his enemies be scattered, and
as the smoake vanisheth, so let them flye away. But let the iust be exalted and reioyce in the presence of the Lord: let the in∣fernall legions not dare to touch theee, nor all Sathans helhounds presume to hinder thee, and hee who disdained not to dye for thee, be hee thy Sauiour and de∣liuerer from all spirituall vexati∣on. Be the gates of paradise o∣pen vnto thee, & thy Christ giue thee thy place and mansion in the same. And he that is the true Pastor, and great Sheepeheard of the Sheepe acknowledge thee for one of his true Sheepe, and receiue thee into his fold, Iesus Christ absolue thee from all thy sins, and place thee on his right hand among his elect, that there thou maist see thy Redeemer face to face, & in the society of bles∣sed
sed soules maist enioy the com∣forts of heauenly cōtemplation, and the blessed vision of God, for euer and euer. Amen.
To the Reader. SEe, Christian bro∣ther, how in the worst times they were prepared to die, and commen∣ded to God: if the ancient books did not proclaime this truth, some would not be∣leeue but that they had been made in this latter time. But seeing the truth cannot be de∣nied, I desire thee with me to obserue these few collecti∣ons arising out of due consi∣deration of the premisses.
1. Heere is answere to that great question, how our fore∣fathers were saued, euen by the same faith as we are at this day. 2. How truly Christ perfor∣med his promise, namely, that the gates of hell should not preuaile against the true faith, for so we see that in the vilest times this Faith hath beene preserued. 3. Obserue how here is no touch, nor once mention of Purgatory, nor of any thing to be done for their good af∣ter this life. 4. Here is no relation to a∣ny pardons or indulgences from the Pope. 5. Here is no necessity laid
downe of sending for a Priest to bring his Hoste, and his Pix, and his holy water, and his Taper: These matters, it seemes, are rather comman∣ded & pressed vpon the peo∣ple by the Romish Cleargie▪ then much regarded by the wiser, and godlier sort of our forefathers: neither are they commanded to stay till the Priest come, but (saith the booke) let these prayers bee said, and the Commendation of his soule, by one of the by∣standers. Lastly, let it bee obserued, that in all these prayers and commendations, and questi∣ons (and these saith the booke are all that be of necessity to
be said) here is not one smack of Popish idolarry, or super∣stition. In these respects I haue thought it no needlesse la∣bour to communicate these to thee (deere brother,) I know there be store of godly prayers and meditations al∣ready extant. But these are of a special vse more then others and are venerable for their antiquity. And are to be the more welcome, because God preserued thē in the hands of our very enemies. And thogh they were mingled with o∣ther things not so good, yetHieronym. ad Laetum. Grandis prudentiae est aurum in luto quaere∣re. let vs know as S. Hierome tels vs, that it is no small point of wisdome, to seeke out
gold out of mire and clay. Make vse of these, and helpe mee with thy prayers, and thou shalt shortly (if God permit) bee perta∣ker of more. FINIS.
