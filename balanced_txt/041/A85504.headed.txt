A TRVE RELATION Out of IRELAND, Of All The Passages, and Overthrowes Given to the REBELS, from the 1 of Iune untill the 10 of July, 1642. Sent in a Letter from Captaine IOHN GOWER, And Ordered to be Printed. London, Printed for Richard Best, 164.
Sir, I May be bold to assume thus much to my selfe, that I have not ommitted any occasion wherein I might serve you according to your commands, I have for∣merly sent you the relation, the good service my Lord of Inchiquin hath done to the state, and this Coun∣try; Ever since our arrivall he hath commanded in chiefe as Ge∣nerall of these Forces by being vice President to his Father in Law during the time of his long sicknesse, in which service I'may mo∣destly say he hath expressed himselfe, the only Terror to our Ene∣mies, the greatest comfort to the Kings good Subjects, and the most absolute (next under God, and your cares) protector of this Pro∣vince; for no man can more certainly relate (his continuall care of our distessed, and beleagur'd friends, his nightly excursitions and in∣cursions upon the enemies quarters, his extraordinary Sedulity in procuring spies, and intelligencers in all parts of the enemies Countries) then my selfe, who had the honor to be imployed in some of these expeditions; but what will now happen unto us we are both ignorant, and have just cause to feare, for the Lord President is now departed this World, and our Enemy hopes, and we feare, an alteration of our chiefe Commanders, for we cannot hope for any in his place, so fit for it as he is himselfe, he being acquainted both with the condition of the people, speaking their own language, and so knowing in the Country, that he is of the whole Army the best guide himselfe, I will not detract from any of our ancient Of∣ficers here, for we have Sir William Oagle, Sir Charles Vava∣ur, Sir John Paulet, very gallant men and old Souldiers, and so have expressed themselves in these affaires, but I am of that opi∣nion,
that they doe finde this kind of service something new to them, for our chiefest expeditions come by camisadoes in the night, or suddn surprislls upon some certaine intelligences of the ene∣mies rells, which seldome happens, but my Lords spies doe discover, and it hath hitherto prooved to the ruine of all, or most of them, as did appeare in the busines with Sir Edward Fitz∣harris, and the overthrow which he gave to the Lord Roch, and the Quonds, and in our last conflict where we got the victory  thousand five hundred Te, and Horse, with about six hundred and fifty of ours, where we slue foure hundred of the enemy, tooke five Colours, some prioners, all their baggage, and many armes, as the relation here inclosed doth further expresse. The former of these expeditions were absolutely his own, and in this later Sir William Oagle, and Sir John Paulet, with part of their Regiments were with him; yet if I doe ascribe that likewise to him, it is no more then their own act, because this I must speake of mine own knowledge, That when we stood in batalia opposite to the Enemy, they seeing the number of the Enemy so far exceeding ours, they were unwilling to consent that we should fight, and told my Lord that they would doe their Offices as Colonells, but the act should be his own, upon which my Lord commanded to charge, and got the victory without the losse of two men, nor doe I imagine but that these Co∣lonells advised my Lord very well, considering what service they had formerly been in, where one Army equally armed, equally valiant had fought: this ods of number had been dangerous to us, but my Lord by his intelligence, certainly knew all the proceed∣ings of their Army, how they were Arm'd, how strong in foot, how in horse, and was very certaine that we farr exceeded them in the strength of the horse, which was the maine ground that made him in my hearing give this reason why he would fight, that with the strength of his horse and the largenesse off the plaine he was able to releeve the foote and bring them off when he pleased. This relation I onely make to conduce to that I formerly saide, that though we have many brave Commanders yet I conceive I cannot detract from any of them in supposing him the most fit man for this warre. I hope and I make no question but you shall heare, that we shall goe for∣wards a pace in our victories so long as he that now commands doth continue in his place, for he hath wrought his intendments almost
to a full ripeness considering the small forces that we have, being not able to march two thousand into the field, But thus I will conclude with you, and value my Iudgment accordingly in other things if it doe not happen according to my sence, that the alteration of our chiefe Officer be not the greatest Remorah to our proceedings that can hap∣pen, but I question not if that greedy beast Ambition be not amongst us, our Colonels and great Officers will Petition you for that which we the inferiour officers, and the rest of the Armie so much desire: I have my selfe had my share in all these businesses, it was my fortune to take a Leiutenant prisoner in the last he is able to pay enough for his ans if I might beit, but I beleeve he will be hanged ere you receive this Letter: if I have done any thing more then ordina∣ry you shall have the relation from Your Servant Iohn Gower Donaroyall Iuly 3. 1642.
THE OCCURRENCES Inclosed in the letter aforesaid. THe Lord Inchiquin marched over the mountaines with his troopes and 80 footmen to pillage the Country, and tooke some Castles that would annoy us, but in his returne, Sir Edward Fitz-harris came downe with his Army and way-laid them, so my Lord fell upon them, beat them out of their holdes, slew about one hundred and forty of them, and came safe home with his prey without the losse of one man. Vpon holy thursday our forces marched into the L. Roch his Country: but the Quondames who are notable rebels, and the Lord Roch had heard of his comming and were drawne into battalia, but my Lord fell upon them, routed them, and kil∣led betwixt two and three hundred, and brought away the prey home safe. The weeke after Whit sunday Sir Charles V∣saur with his regiment, and Captaine Gepsons troop beleagured a place called Drumaneeue, and battered it the first day, with 2 peeces of ordnance, made a breach in the Wall of the Court, and entred the breach with the souldiers, but were beaten off it with the losse of five or six men: the wall being hollow, the e∣nemie sets fire on it, so that they could not assault there any more: next day my Lord appointed me to wait on him thither, where they had drawne their approches to the gate, but those guns would not bite: so that they were constrained to send to Corke to fetch a greater, which came in two or three dayes, so they battered it all that day, all the next, and in conclusion took it by composition, that they should depart with their lives and
their cloathes on their backes. The next day my Lord sent me with forty horses through the Roch his Country, into the Quon∣dams where we saw the enemy, tooke away their cowes, sheepe, and horses, so we brought them all home safe, they never once offering to assault or hinder us: within two dayes my Lord In∣chiquin drew the horse and foot together and sate downe before the Lord Roch his Castle, and battered it all that day and that night, the next day they begd quarter, which my Lord denyed. I was sent with my Lords troope to pillage round about, I brought above a thousand sheep and three hundred cattell: that night our troop was commanded to lie at the foot of the moun∣tain to stop any reliefe from comming to the Castle we lay there two nights, which hath bred a great sicknesse amongst them I brought out of Yorkeshire, all this whole night and day the Castle was battered and no quarter would be given them, untill such time as newes was brought, that the enemy was gathered together and fallen upon our quarters at Dona-royall, so that we were forced to give them quarter, and turne them out of the Castle with their lives, and to haste to our owne Towne, which we did, we tooke great store of Corne, many Arms, and much other provision in the Castle, there were seven or eight hundred people in it besides old women and children, who fled into the mountaines, where we shall be sure to have them the next Castle we take, and then they may certainely expect a generall hang∣ing. The 27 of Iune about 12 of the clocke at night my Lord Inchiquin sent me out with forty horse and fifty foot to releive Liscarroll and Newmarket, which I did, and drove the Cattle away from the Castle Anno and beat 300 of their men from the prey and came safe home. Vpon Saint Peters Eve, my Lord Inchiquin received intelligence that eighteen colours were come from the county of Limbrick, and were set down before a place called Castle Dodd, in the hands of one Master Munck a friend unto our Army, and a good subiect, my Lord as he hath beene alwayes ready to relieve such, advised with Sir William Oagle and Sir Iohn Paulet, who suddainly concluded to march: which wee did betwixt eleaven and twelve a clocke that night, and found them not there, but heard they were gone: unto a place called New towne alias Shaudrum, in the County of Cork, from
whence they intended the next night with other forces to fall on our quarters according to their pretence: they had heard of our comming by that time we marched toward them, for most of our neighbours here are Traytors, in the same condition with the rebels, wee found them at the end of a Champiane in Battalia, a little bog being betweene them and us, the troopes iust behind them, and under the towne a great morosse and wood: we presented them battaile, but they immediately drew out of the plaine into the lanes, and the a soresaid townes, so that our horse could no way helpe us or offend them, upon which we drew up the musquetiers, who disputed the businesse with them, for an houre, untill such time as the horse found out a little way through the wood & incompassed the enemie round, which as soone as they perceived, they retreated, but in such, disorder, that our horse having some convenient ground to charge them, fell upon them, and so absolutely routed then whole body; the businesse after that was nothing, but the execu∣tion I beleeve was as great as any hath beene since these warrs began: the number could not be certainely knowne, because the execution was so dispersed, & the enemie throwing downe their weapons and running, gave us encouragement to fight disbanded, so that the slaughter was over all the fields, both bogs and ditches; the generall vote is, that there were slaine about foure or five hundred men, but if you will have my opi∣nion, having the command of the horse that day, and saw what were slaine, both by the horse and foote, there was slaine six hundred; we tooke sive colours, some prisoners, where∣of I tooke my selfe a Lieuetenant prisoner, we tooke all their baggage, and many armes, two daies after this battle my Lord President died, and without question poysoned by the popish Doctors. Yours Iohn Gower.
