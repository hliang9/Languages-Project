A Letter from Sir IOHN HOTHAM to Master Speaker of the Honourable House of Commons. SIR, I Am very sorry, I have this unhappy occasion to write to you, which is Sir Hugh Cholmleys Revolt; who has of late taken a Commission from the King, for the forces hee had raised by authority of Parlia∣ment, & for the Castle of Scarborough; It seems he thought at first to have carried it so closely, as to have (before I perceived) retired all hee had in this Towne, and for that purpose sent Captaine Bushell with a Ship and seven peeces of Ordnance in her; But as God would have it, I had the night before a secret intelligence sent me of it, and so have the Ship and Ordnance sure: And thereupon instantly dispatched a Catch to Captaine Haddock, and our Ships that ride Northward to give them notice of it, lest little suspecting his revolt they might put into that Haven and be entrapped, and my Catch being at Sea well mann'd and having in her four small Guns, met with a Scarborough Ship and Ammunition going from the Parliament to him, which was three pieces of Ordinance, twenty barrels of powder, forty Carabines, some Pi∣stols and Swords, and two great Fats of Match, all which they seised upon, and brought hither, and it shall, God willing, be better employed. Captain Bushell protests deeply his innocency, and more then that he was to bring back some of Sir Hughs things from Hull, he knew not any thing of the businesse, and sweares to mee hee will doe his utmost service for you. Most of Sir Hughs Officers, and a very great many both of his horse and foot have forsaken him, and are now at Hull with mee: Sir Thomas Nortcliff, a son in law of mine came from him to mee yesternight with thirty good horse, and tels me he hopes, the rest will follow his Captaine, Lievtenant Vanderhurst came with him. Cap∣tain Ledgard a Kinsman of mine, that I sent from hence, hath likewise left him: But Lievtenant Colonell Alured was the first that consented to joyn with him in this bad action. Thus have I truly related to you by my first opportunity, the whole progresse of this unfortunate attempt wherein hee hath utterly lost himself, but God be blest, done your businesse no prejudice.
The two Dutchmen are exceeding gallant men, and have done you very good service, the ones name is Froome, the other Vanderhurst; I have in your name, assured them of your constant respect to all fidelity. Sir, there shall no oppor∣tunity of doing the House service scape mee; and since I sent Captaine Bushell thither, hee has performed his Trust gallantly, imprisoned one Iames Cholmley, whom Sir Hugh had left there; and seized upon the Castle. I sent my Catch with more Souldiers to relieve him, and twenty pound to the Souldiers in the Castle to drink. Sir, I ever remayne your most humble Servant, Iohn Hotham. SIR, ALthough I cannot but believe you have already heard of the rendring the Castle of Scarborough, by Sir Hugh Cholmley to the Cavaliers, yet because (it may be) some may be desi∣rous to be satisfied how it comes to passe that a Fort of that strength should be put into another hand without bloud, to give you & al the world satisfactiō in that particular, I have addressed these unto you being my old friend and acquain∣tance, and blame me not (I beseech you) if in doing it I exceed the bounds of a Letter, for I desire to set forth all the circumstances according to truth, and when I have so done let the blame stick where it is, I hope my selfe and other the Officers who quitted the employment, shall appeare to be honest men, and to have done nothing but what was fit for those who had a care of the publick, as well as their own private interests. Upon Friday the tenth of March (as I take it) Sir Hugh Cholmley, to whose trust the Castle was commited by Parliament, and by him to me in his absence came to Scarborough from Beverley, whither upon the taking of Stamford bridge by the Enemy, he was retreated from Malton (it being conceived not tenable, as the Enemies forces then lay.) I dare not say that at his return thi∣ther, he had any intention to betray the Castle, for the very next day, hee call'd my selfe and the rest of his Officers to consult touching the putting of
forces into the Castle of Pickering, and the breaking downe Yeddingham, and How bridges for the preservation of Pickeringlythe which all of us concei∣ved to be very necessary, and for that purpose Captaine Froom, a German, who commanded his owne troope, Sir Tho: Nortcliffe with his troop of Dra∣gooners, and another troop of Dragooners commanded by one Lievtenant Strangways (Medley the Captaine being formerly taken prisoner at Yarum) were sent abroad, but by the way they found the Enemy was got before them, and had possessed themselves of Pickering Towne and Castle with some other Towns not far distant, and had placed divers Musquetiers at How bridge (be∣ing the most considerable) for the securing of that passage against us: So that it was utterly impossible for them without certain ruine, or at least extream dan∣ger to effect that they were sent for. Yet falling happily upon some of the Ene∣mies forces at Thornton, who were newly come thither from plundring Sir Iohn Hotham and his Tenants at Fyling they resolved to charge them, which accord∣ingly they did, not surprizing them in their quarters, as was falsly suggested by the other party: for Captain Froom, caused a Pistoll to be discharged at the Town end, and a Drum to be beat a quarter of a mile ere he came to the Towne, by which the Enemy had the alarme, and put themselves in a posture of defence, but God gave the victory to us, and delivered into our hands one and twenty prisoners, of which one was a Serjeant Major, another a Captain, a 3d. a Lievte∣nant, two Cornets, with one of their Colours two Quarter-masters, three Cor∣porals, a Trumpeter and a Farrier, the rest were common Troopers, there being at that time two or three Troops more of the Enemy within 12 score (who had not the spirit to assist their fellows) and neere upon 500 more within a mile or two, which occasioned our men (having intelligence of it) not to prosecute that successe so fully as otherwise they would if the Enemy had been further di∣stant: These prisoners were brought to Scarborough, where they were used with all humanity (wherein it must be acknowledged, hee hath not been a∣wanting to any he hath heretofore taken; notwithstanding the cruell usage of his men which were taken at Yarum: After some time letters passed betwixt him, Collonel Goring and others, and upon one day two Trumpets came to Scar∣borough, the one from Collonell Goring at Yorke, the other from Sir Francis Mackworth at Thornton where the forementioned conflict was, and where the Enemy at that time lay quartered. My selfe and others were made believe these Trumpets came for exchange of Prisoners; though I confesse I wonde∣red much two Trumpets should come from two places at one time for one and the same businesse; Yet such was my respect unto him, and my confidence in
his fidelity, that I soone answered my selfe, with this that it might well be, and so, said nothing of it to any man. I doe not know what the contents of those Letters were, but after that, I found, he would at severall times advance the Kings and the Earle of Newcastles Forces, exceedingly undervaluing those under the command of the Earle of Essex and the Lord Fairfax, hee often affirmed hee was sleighted by the Parliament, to whom he had severall times written for sup∣plies, but could never obtain them in that measure that hee desired. What his intentions were in it whither to sound my fidelity, or for some other end I know not, but I indeavoured to give him as satisfactory an answer as I could, yet did not all this time imagine or conceit that he intended any way to defraud the trust concreded to him by the Parliament. Mr. James Cholmely his kinsman (whose sonne serves the Earle of Craw∣ford, and who I feare hath had too great an influence upon him in this busines) was afterward (as I imagine) sent to Yorke about the effecting of this fine de∣signe, though at his returne he gave it out with many deep protestations that riding into the Country about some businesse, hee was made prisoner by the Enemy about 6 miles from Scarborough, and carryed to Yorke, from whence by means of some friend and acquaintance he there meet with, hee said, he had happily escaped. On Munday the 20. of March Sir Hugh Cholmley rid early abroad with one servant onely, and lest I should suspect something, sent one to me, to tell me he was gone to meet Sir John Hotham, that they might consult touching the send∣ing of Forces to him for clearing that side of the Countreys: but he desired if any asked for him, I should say he was gone to Whitby his owne house to take care for the preservation of it and the Towne, which had formerly made good expressions of fidelity to the King and Parliament. I expected he would have returned at night, but finding he did not, wondered at it, yet feared no change, because I suspected nothing, conceiving the place of meeting with Sir John Hotham, and the length of the consultation might very well retard his returne till the next day. He then returned and told me, hee had stayd the night before at Ganton (a friends house to us both being 6 miles from Scar∣borough) which because I knew nothing to the contrary, nor dreamed of any falsity, I did easily beleeve. On Thursday morning he sent Captaine Browne Bushell to Hull with a small Ship, which he and I, and some others had newly set forth to restraine provisions for going to Newcastle, with directions to bring from thence certain money and other things which lay there for him, but I was neither made acquainted with his going by Sir Hugh nor suspected
any ill intentions for delivery of the Castle untill Friday betwixt 7 and 8 of the clock at night that he sent for me up into the Castle (where he lay) and after some discourse fell to magnifie the Kings forces, and at last told me plainly he was at Yorke on Munday before with the Queen, that he resolved to hold the Castle for the King, and by Commission from him, and that hee intended the next day so to declare himselfe, asking me my resolution concerning it. I told him, he gave me very short warning; Yet I hoped (although I conceived he had dealt very ill with me being his neere kinsman, and whom hee had inga∣ged in the same service with him) to capitulate touching the rendring of the Castle without making me acquainted before hand with it that I might pro∣vide for my owne safety) he would give me leave to use my conscience, which he said he was willing to doe; I then desired him I might have liberty to passe to Hull with my wife and children, and that I might have a note from him to that purpose, which he promised to doe; and further, that if I were taken by the way, he would procure my inlargement. I spake to him further con∣cerning his breach of trust, and told him what a dishonour it would bee to himselfe, and what a staine to his posterity thus to violate it, and would glad∣ly have perswaded him to have continued faithfull, offering to goe post my selfe to London for him and to labour to obtaine such conditions for him from the Parliament, as he should approve and like of; But he answered he was in∣gaged and resolved to performe what hee had promised, and so I left him, and presently went into the Town to consult with a friend what course to run, but he not being within, I returned to my owne house. About ten of the clocke at night I received letters from Hull, by which I had notice of his resolution, together with a packet to himselfe from Sir Iohn Hotham, which because I con∣ceived there might be in it some good advice, and for that I was desirous hee should consult with his pillow about it, I was very carefull to see delivered, and therefore sent one of my servants up with it to the Castle. It seemes the Letters were of another effect then I suspected, for Sir Iohn Hotham having notice of his resolution to render the Castle, and conceiving Captaine Bushell was by him imployed to Hull with no good intent, and not knowing whi∣ther he might comply with him or not in that bad action, had made stay of Captain Bushell, and the Ship, and thereof gave him notice by those letters. He wisht my man to tell me I should come to him to the Castle in the morning, which accordingly I did; He told mee what Sir Iohn Hotham had done to Bushell and that he must stay mee in lieu of him till hee were delivered, yet promised to protect mee from violence, and that I should not receive the least
prejudice, and upon my faith given not to stirre without his licence, he was content I should walke at liberty. I presently dispatcht a messenger to Hull to give Sir Iohn Hotham notice of these proceedings, and indeavoured my selfe in the mean time to get my goods on Shipboard, that I might take an opportu∣nity of getting my Family and them away (if it might bee) though I stayed behinde my selfe. After my departure he sent for Sir Thomas Norcliffe, Cap∣taine Froom, Captaine Vanderhurst a Dutchman, who commanded his Foot company, and other his Officers to whom hee imparted his resolution. Sir Thomas Norcliffe so much misliked the businesse, that he presently departed to Hull, Froom told him he would be ready to serve him in an honest way, but never used to bee of the Traytours company, Vanderhurst and some others tooke time to deliberate. About nine of the clocke Froom, Vanderhurst with about 8 or 9. troopers came to my house to advise with me what was to bee done; We debated the businesse, and truly the Souldiers were very ill pleased that he dealt so with us, and showed themselves very forward to have mar∣ched up to the Castle, and have made him prisoner. The men were all stran∣gers to me, and two of them to this Kingdome, and therefore I held it no great discretion to discover my selfe too far unto them whose hearts I knew not, nor whither some of them might not be sent by him to sift and circumvent me, and it may be, if I had shewed my self extreme forward in it, some of them might have been jealous of me, because I was his kinsman: I returned this answer; That for my owne part I would adventure my skin in the quarrell as freely as any man, but as for attempting to surprize the Castle, I could not assent unto it for these reasons; It was a place of great strength, and advantage to him that was then within it, The Inhabytants of the Towne were extreme malignant, wee had not felt the pulse of the Souldiers, nor knew how they stood affected, nor what the Gunners intended to do, who were the men must do much of the businesse if it came to action (three of which were but newly brought in by him, and one or two of those three had formerly borne part in a mutiny which was made against one in the Towne by some ill affected persons for which I had punisht them, and therefore had the lesse reason to trust them.) But besides all this, I told them there was a powerfull enemy at hand (or at least within call) from whom we must expect certaine ruine if wee should show our selves, and not goe through with the businesse as wee desired. As we were thus debating the businesse, comes one in and informes us, that there were two Troopes of horse at the Townes end, which quite spoyled all our bu∣sinesse, for although the report was grounded upon a mistake, either of some
Market people who were then comming to the Market, or else of Sir Thomas Norcliffes Dragoones, many of which went that day from Scarborough after their Captaine, yet because it was not without probability, it caused us to breake off our discourse, and this was the very reason why wee did nothing, for it could not sinke into our heads that any man of discretion should bee so impudent as to betray a Fort, and have no power of the Enemy to joyne with him in case he should find opposition within, especially when the chiefe Officers had not bin formerly consulted with, nor their affections tryed, nor any party made amongst the Souldiers, to make that good which was intended. After this I had severall thoughts what to do. It grieved mee to see the Castle thus lost, but I was jealous of my power to helpe it: Many things came into my mind, and a great conflict I had in my selfe touching the point of assassi∣nation, and whither in point of conscience, it were lawfull without any by-ends of ones own to kill an Enemy to God and his Countrey, as my heart told me he was, and so taking him away in this sin, send him in all probabi∣lity to Hell. At last I resolved in dubits, optimum est sequi tutiorem partem, and therefore chused rather to watch an opportunity, if I could to make him prisoner, To which purpose I went up to the Castle, I conferred with severall Souldiers, whom I found cordiall to the Cause, yet fearfull to ingage themselves without good force to back them. I spoke with an Officer who must be name∣lesse, who seemed much to lament the Colonels Apostacy, and desired of me to know what was to be done; I asked him if he would be honest, he protested he would, I wished him then to clap to my Lievtenant (whom he had corrup∣ted, and who then stood like Cerberus keeping hell gates) as I would to the Colonell, and wee would make them both prisoners. Hee askt mee touching the affections of the Souldiers, I told him I was confident, they were right and would stick to us; so downe we went to the Guard together, to see the number of them, and to prepare them before hand for our intended designe: Just as wee were going downe came the Colonell, and three or foure of his servants armed with Pistols, so that wee were forced to breake off our communication, and went along with him: As we came by the Guard he stayed and told the souldiers what he intended, but protested hee aymed at no∣thing, but the peace of the Country and obedience to the King, I hearing that answered I hoped we had not bin in a way of rebellion all this time. At which word hee catched mee by the hand and calling for halfe a score musket∣tires said he would teach me to rule my tongue: I told him if he hangd me I must and would speake having so good reason for it, and so was I carryed guarded with his servants and those Muskettiers to his house where I remained
till upon setling of both our hot bloud, he was content to let me goe, with my wife, children, and goods to Hull, upon my promise first made to procure Sir Iohn Hotham to inlarge Captaine Bushell within two dayes, or else returne to Scarborough within that time, which I assured him I would do; and therupon had his licence to depart that night by sea for Hull. On Munday I there arrived and that day obtained Bushels inlargement who the next day returned to Scar∣borough, but never got any thankes for it from him who seemed so tender over him as you shall heare afterwards. Captaine Froom, and Captaine Vanderhurst followed me with almost all the troope, and divers of the foot souldiers who now serve under me at Hull, where by Sir Iohn Hotham I am againe put into imployment as are also the other two Captaines, Froom being made Captaine of the troup hee brought with him and Vanderhust his Lievtenant according to their owne desires. And thus Sir, you have all the particular circumstances of this bad action; let me begge your patience but a little and you shall have the second part of the story, which I hope will give both your selfe and all honest men better satisfaction. Captain Bushell (though Cozen German to the Collonell) did so little ap∣prove of his kinsmans ways that he made many protestations ere he went from Hull to recover the Castle thus perfidiously lost. It fell out happily that Mr. Iames Cholmley a man of no great experience was made Captain of the Castle and Henry Bushell (who is Captain Bushells Brother) his lievtenant. The two brothers conferre together and at twelve of the Clock at night, on Thurs∣day last the Captain with 4 more was let in by his brother, who had prepared the Souldiers (ready enough to revolt from that side they liked not) with Beere and Tobacco, he acquainting the souldiers with his intentions, they promised to stick to him, the sergeant who commanded the guard was layd hold on, the Gunners were next surprized; but swore fidelity, there was nothing left now but to get the Tower, a place of great strength where the Captaine was lodged, and in which all the amunition and provisions for the Castle were layd. For the effecting hereof the Serjeant was caused to knock at the gate and to tell the keeper of the Magazin who came to know what was the matter that there was an alarme in the Town and that the souldiers must be furnisht with powder and shott, Credit being given hereunto and the gate opened Bushell entred with his souldiers, commanded the delivery of the keyes and thereby became Ma∣ster of the Castle without one drop of bloud spilt on either side and in it of the new made Captain, and the next morning of one Captain Sunderland and some other Cavaliers who were come to rejoyce with their new gotten freind. And thus the Castle of Scarbrough which both in my owne and the opinion of
many being well and sufficiently provided is able to oppose an army of 10000 men was twice taken in one weeke: first by treachery, and afterwards by ho∣nest policy, and is now in the hands of Captain Bushell, who vowes to hold it for the King and Parliament, and sooner to blow up the fabrick then that ever it should come into the hands of the Cavaliers: This day he writ Let∣ters to Sir Iohn Hotham for assistance, which he hath taken care to be sent to him to morrow morning. I hope the Parliament will thinke of him that recovered it, and give him such requitall as shall incourage both him and all o∣thers to adhere and stick close unto them: I will trouble you no further at pre∣sent being weary with writing, If I may receive any letters from you the next week here at Hull, I shall be willing to hold Intelligence with you, and to let you know the passages of the North. However, Sir, I assure you none is more truly yours, then Hull Good-friday 1643. Your affectionate friend and servant. FINIS.
