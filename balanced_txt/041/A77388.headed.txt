A brief account of the GRAMMAR-LECTƲRE, in Kings-Head Court near the Theater Royal, Drury-Lane; Where Children are with great ease and speed perfectly taught the Latine Tongue, without being slavishly put to needless torture, or endless trouble; and nothing is demanded for their Teaching, or for Books, till the busi∣ness is Performed. WHereas divers Gentlemen, Citi∣zens, and others, call frequent∣ly upon us, and either finde us not within, or at least so bu∣sie, as that we have not time to satisfie them about our Method &c. Concern∣ing which they enquire: We have caused this rude and unpolisht Sheet to be Printed, to which we refer them, and all others, at present, for sa∣tisfaction; which shall be given them as briefly, as plainly, and as fully, as the good old Axiome, Artis est celare Artem, will permit; for a secret which hath cost us almost 30. Years Study, and the perusal of all Authors whatsoever that have
writ on this subject, is not to be too far disco∣vered to every body. They may be pleased therefore to understand, that we are not over eagerly desirous of too many Scholars at once, Paucis contenti audito∣ribus, taking but few at a time, and with our good will receiving none who are deeply inga∣ged in other Schooles; our design being to do good to Man-kind in general, and at the same time to do no harm to any particular Individu∣al, by taking away his Scholars, or reflecting up∣on his way of Teaching, or the like. Next, as for the Childrens coming but once or twice a Week, which some (who are great admirers of, and servants to blind custome) will not bear with; they may please to take notice, that if need be, they may come oftner; thrice, four times, five times, six times a Week; but their coming will be only a needless trouble to themselves and us; for we can with the same labour give them enough to ruminate upon for half a Week, as for half a Day: In short, if Pa∣rents send their Children any whether to learn, let them send them thither where they shall be well taught, whether they stay a long time, or not (that's all one;) but if they send them only to be kept out of harms way so long, there are enough old Women, or ordinary mean Pedants, who will do their business for two pence a Week. As for the Price, that is reasonable, only alter∣ing
as the capacity of the Learner is quicker or slower; there being more or less pains to be ta∣ken with him accordingly. Then as for the Method, they may please to know, that this business (so much wondred at, and thought impossible to be done, yet) is re∣ally performed by these means, First, By bringing the Grammer-Rules and Authors to the capacity of the Learners, and not screwing and forcing their capacity to them. Secondly, By teaching every particular Youth singly by himself (for certainty's sake) all the Rules and Intrigues of the Language. Thirdly, By giving them full liberty, as to the time and place of studying; they hear the Lecture in few words, and then ruminate upon it when they will, and where they will, in the morning or afternoon, at home, or in the fields; but stay not to hinder one another by noise, childish fooleries, or the like. Fourthly, By using them with all possible gentleness and lenity; there are no Rodds marching up and down the room, to fright them, and keep them in fear and bondage, all the while they are present; Such fear and dread necessarily hindering their effe∣ctual tending of their business, the removal thereof, on the other side, must much further their proficiency.
As to the First, 'Twere easie to prove most of the Rules, which are commonly taught Children, to be as hard to understand, as any Logick, or Metaphysick Lecture at Oxford, and the Authors put into their hands at first dash, to be as difficult as any they ever meet with afterwards; now how senseless and irra∣tional this is, let any man judge: Those who have gone about to make new Grammers, they have only affronted the Canon, and ren∣dred things hard and difficult before, more hard and more difficult: And why Irregular words must needs be pickt out to be the Ex∣amples of the Declensions and Conjugations; and why the Grammer Rules, and Memorial Verses, should be in Latine, which Language the Youth or Child is supposed not yet to un∣derstand, Wise persons cannot yet discover the reason: Give Children easie Rules, and easie Books, and then something will be done; but if we must for ever , and because Youth have all along been taught in a dull blundering way, therefore they must be taught so still; Knowing men will doubt, which is most to be pittied, the folly of the Teacher, or the misfortune of the Learner. As for the Second, Children when entred into any School, are commonly put into some Class with others, and there take the same Part that others do, and the same Lesson that
others do; and if they understand it, so; if not, there is no provision made for their help; Some things they learn over half a score times, other things they learn not at all, or not so perfectly as to un∣derstand them; whereas (alas!) every Learner should be taught the Fundamentalls by himself, and not take them by chance; for at that rate it may so happen, as that he may not attain them all his life; Give him the whole Scheme in his head, and then he will be able to goe on vigorously, comfort∣ably and effectually, to make himself by degrees Master of the Language. As to the Third, Children are children, and will be playing childish tricks, and hinder one another while together, not only by noise, but also by wag∣gish gestures and actions; to avoid which, they are to be together as little while as is possible, while they learn any thing; Indeed when they exercise them∣selves in talking and discoursing Latine, that is ano∣her case, and we have our times to let them come, and also stay together long enough for that purpose. For the Fourth, Something we shall add as to that Head likewise, though modesty will not permit us to speak what we could; Ingenuous Youths should not be punisht in such a dis-ingenuous manner as the cu∣stome is in most Schools, especially for no cause in the world, as commonly they are; Delerant reges, ple∣ctuntur Achivi, the fault is sometimes in the Teacher, sometimes in the way of teaching; but the poor chil∣dren they are beaten for not understanding that, which 'twas impossible they should undrestand, ha∣ving
not been told it at all (it may be) or at least not in that manner as for them to comprehend it: 'Tis true, we know there are divers most excellent, ingenuous, discreet and learned persons, who do use their Schollars in a noble and ingenuous way; only for fear of a thing call'd , they have not yet entred upon the Right Easie and Speedy way of teaching, which we much wonder at; (these mens persons we love and respect, nay we highly esteem and honour them; and should any line here written reflect upon, or endamage them in the least, we would recant all we have said, and give over this whole bu∣siness:) Others there are also of a lower sphere, good, industrious, honest men, who bring up their Schollars in a kind and gentle way, and make no more use of their power of correction than just needs must; (these are to be commended and encouraged, and withall, shewn the right way of instructing Youth:) But in too many places we are sure 'tis otherwise; Children be∣ing taken and beaten most barbarously, they know not why, or wherefore, nor never shall; We have often seen innocent, ingenuous, industrious Youths, when they have taken pains, as it had been for their lives, and studied all day and all night, till 2, or 3, a Clock in the morning, yet next day they have been scourged 10, 16, 20, lashes, when no reason could possibly be assigned, why they should be so inhumanely used; and therefore the reason indeed, was only and meerly be∣cause the roguy leacherous Paedagogue had a mind to whip them: Now of all Cruelties, Leacherous cruelty is the worst, and woe to them who fall under it; But
of this, as also of the Rogueries of some flustering Pedants, the World shall hear more at large ere long both in Prose and Verse; for, as some extravagant Persons have one way of satisfying their lusts, others other ways: So Some School-Masters on the Boyes breeches Curry their own heat and itches. Hudibr. We are verily perswaded, and have good and firme grounds to believe, that many take up that Calling, and continue in it to their old age, for that power's sake which is most unjustly allowed them of corre∣cting their Scholars, when and how they please; Now what a sad thing it is for the same Person that de∣lights in the execution, to be both Judge and Exe∣cutioner, we need not say; To tell you what we think however, and what wiser Men than we think like∣wise, 'twere far better that Learning perisht out of the Earth, than such horrid cruelties should be per∣mitted, as are daily exercised in divers places; it would make your hair stand an end, and your very heart bleed (how hardy soever you are) to be a Spe∣ctator of what is done in that way, we know where. The common Objection to all that hath been dis∣coursed upon this head, is, That Children will not learn without being beaten, and that soundly too sometimes; To which we return this Answer, That if it be meant Universally, it is a down-right falshood; there being many Children who really love ingenuity, love their Book, and will do whatsoever is set them to do with a words speaking; but if indeed it be
meant of some particulars, it must be granted to be true; but then such of whom 'tis true, were better be set to some other employment, and not be put al∣most a third part of their lives to continual slavery; for, to be kept always poring upon Books, which they hate, and to groan every day under the Birch, is in our opinion little better; and he at the Oare or Mines, is far the happier of the two: Some Parents indeed will have their Children to School; they will subject them to the humour of the Teacher, to be lasht, Ad libitum plagosi Orbilij, just as those poor de∣luded Heathen of old, they would sacrifice their ten∣der Infants to Moloch, and other Devils; we know not whether the Children have cause to thank them; nay, we know hundreds who do not thank them, but afterwards in their riper years make them wish with akeing hearts, they had followed the Poets advice, Praeconem facias vel Architectum. This brief Account we desire all parties con∣cern'd, to accept of at present for their own ease and ours: And if any ignorant pragmatical Person finde fault with any thing here writ, truly we value it not; If any serious understanding Gentlemen be offended at any passage, we presume upon their pardon, at long run, there being no just cause of offence given in the least; We having wronged no body at all, but only in a noble and generous way (with some pains and more cost) done our endeavour to have our English Youth no more abused, and the World no longer cheated.
