OVERTURE Regulating the Breadth and Length of LINNEN: To His Grace JAMES Duke of QUEENSBERRY Marquiss of Drumfries-Shire, Earl of Drumlanrick, and Sancher, &c. His Majesty's High Com∣missioner to the Parliament of SCOTLAND, and Most Ho∣nourable Estates of Parliament. EDINBƲRGH, Printed by John Reid, 1700.
AN OVERTURE, Annent Regulating the BREADTH and LENGTH of LINNEN. To His Grace JAMES Duke of QƲEENSBERRY, His Ma∣jesty's High Commissioners to the Parliament of SCOT∣LAND, and Most Honour∣able Estates of Parliament. THE Sovereign Governour of the Universe, and inexhaust∣able Fountain of all Perfecti∣on, has been pleased to Cloath Your Grace with a Considerable Ray of His Power and Greatness; For∣asmuch as, you Represent the Person and Authority of one of the most August,
Magnanimous and Potent Monarchs in the World; which is a Dignity no less be∣coming so Great a Personage. Descend∣ed of so Illustrious Progenitors, whose Magnanimous and Heroick perform∣ance make up a considerable part of our Histories; than the Moderation, Affi∣bility and other singular Accomplish∣ments of your Person, from whence we expect such special Acts of your Bene∣volence, Goodness and Prudence, in your Conduct on this Occasion, as may be lasting Blessings to this poor Nation, and Emblam your Name to Posterity; For as 'tis the property of the Fountain of all Goodness to take pleasure in Acts of Goodness and Bounty, so it is the Glory and Happiness of Mortals to i∣mitate Him as much as possible, and the greater they are in Power and Au∣thority so much more are they Capable of Acts of Benovolence; And your Grace being now in so Eminent a Sta∣tion, has a fair Opportunity of doing much towards the Wellfare and pros∣perity
of this Kingdom, and there∣by to add a Gem to the Diadems of Glo∣ry purchased by your Ancestors, and E∣ternize your Name to following Gene∣rations. And you the Honourable Estates of Parliament from all Corners of the King∣dom being now Assembled, cannot but be well acquainted, and sensibly touch∣ed with the present Circumstances thereof, and consequently understand how to Regulate Matters, so as the present miseries of the same may be in a great Measure removed; Wherefore it may seem presumptious for a Person in my Circumstances to offer any thing to your Wisdomes Consideration for that end. Nevertheless when 'tis con∣sidered, that a Finger or a Toe may be as sensibly affected with the Distemper of the Body as one Eye or Arm, and that a Mean Person may discry some∣thing worthy to be noticed by the Greatest, which through the Multipli∣city of other important Affairs, may
be by them overlook'd; your Wisdom will Construct favourably of this un∣dertaking, especially seing the sole Mo∣tive hereunto inducing me, can bea no other Interpretation then my hearty desires to see the prosperity of this poo Nation, being exceedingly concerned to behold the distressed Condition it is in at present, and has formerly expres∣sed my good wishes for the publick Good, not only to the hazard, but to the loss of my ALL, as is not altogethe unknown to some of the Honourable Members of this August Assembly, of which I might give a hint, if Your Wise∣doms would have the patience to hear, & the Goodness to notice, both as to what I did in the Equipment of Men for his Majesty's Service, about the time of his Accession to the Throne, and other Services; As well as the Expence I have been at of late, in forming some Over∣tures into writing, and puting the same to the Press, meerly for the Publick Good, which tho it be but small, is
much to a poor Man, and two Mi from a poor Widaw is accounted great∣er Charity, than much Treasure from the Rich. But that I may come to the Matter purposed, and be no farther tideous by a prolix Introduction; I humbly con∣ceive it were not unworthy of your Wis∣doms Consideration, to think on some means for Regulating the Breadth and Length of our Linnen, which at present is so irregular, and for the most part so narrow, that it doth in a great Measure marr Traffick, and is unfit for many uses. The Length of our Linnen is com∣monly from 7 or 8 ellns to 10 or 12 a Piece, as many of them, with odd ha Yairds as of an even Measure, and these too often made up by tareing of an hand∣breadth or two off one that is over, to make up another that is short; And the Breadth from an Eln to 3 Quarters of an Eln so that when the same is of∣ered to Sale in any place except England
and Ireland, where the Merchants are prety well acquainted with those irre∣gular Measures, scace will a Mer∣chant give more for the longest than the shortest Piece, or for the Broad than the narrow, being unacquainted with Calculating such irregular Measures, all other Nations making each sort of their Linnen at a certain Length and Breadth, as we may lee by the Musel∣lines, Cambricks, and Calegoes, &c. Imported, each sort or species of these being of a certain Length and Breadth, on which the Merchant relyes without Measuring, buying the same by the Piece. But when our Linnen is offered to Sale in Forreign Parts, the Pieces be∣ing so irregular, there is no Barganing that way. Perhaps without farther Tryal, some may object, that already a Law is made for Regulating the Breadth and Length of Linnen, but the puting of it in practice was found incommodious and Grieve∣ous, for as much as, many of the Wea∣vers
not having furniture for wor∣ng Cloth of that breadth could not mply, and honest People having eir Webs seized upon that account, de Complaint to their Landlords, epresenting that the Price of their nnen being only that which was al∣ted for paying of their Rent, with∣t which they could not make pay∣ent, and the same being taken from m, because not of the Dementions scribed by Law. The Landlords erposed, and by their Remonstrances vailed to make this Law of no effect. Notwithstanding of all which. I shall with Submission) make it appear, t the breadth and length may be gulated with little or no difficulty,  in the first place, shall shew some siderable advantages of making the he of a fixed length and breadth, viz, welve elns long, and one broad. so t when the same is offered to Sale, erchants will easily know how to buy y the peice, without troubling them∣selves
to calculat irregular Measure is now commonly in use: But the gr set advantage is in the breadth,  Our narrow Linnen being unfit for m uses (needless to be Repeated) reason of its narrowness, is in a man meerly bought by the Merchants a Linnen Drepers of England to sort their course Linnens, and is alm wholly applyed for the use of Boys  Children; And the meanest sort Persons of riper years, who cont themselves with it, allenerally for  cheapness of the same; Forasmuch they can buy three elns near three ∣ters and an half Broad, as cheap as  elns of that which is eln Broad, of  like fineness. This being Matter of Fact, can be otherwise proven than by the Te∣imony of Merchants and others, a quainted in that matter, to whose D termination I refer it; And in the me time shall make it appear, that the is no such Difference in the proportion
Yearn, of which each is made, as the Price, as is above hinted; For sup∣se the narrow Cloth were but three arters Broad, the Yearn which would  four elns of the one would be three  the other, whereas oft times the arrow Cloth is three quarters and an lf in Breadth, the Yearn which makes ght elns of this, would be seven of  eln Broad; But that I may come aret to the true Breadth, and that hich will very near hold in all Nar∣w Linnen, is three quarters and about e third part of an quarrer of an eln, his also I refer to the Judgement and etermination of all acquainted in that ffair; And here I fix the Breadth in eneral, and from thence shol Calcul∣ite the Difference, adhereing alwise  my first Assertion. Viz. That Lin∣n of an eln Broad, will give a third more than that of the Ordinar Breadth, at is to say, if the Narrow give 10 ence, the Broad will give 15, and if e Narrow give 12, the other will
give 18 at least, &c. Whatever Price is of, yea, I may affirm that 12 d. Clo Narrow, wil of the same fineness give  d. if eln Broad, even tho it were an in less; Nevertheless I shall reckon t the Difference, as 18 to 12, and pr ceed to Calculate the Difference of t Proportion of Yearn, of which ea is made, which being as 10 to 12, for  elns of Cloath at 3 Quarters and thi part of a quarter, doth exactly agr to ten ells of one eln in Breadth. Th Price of 12 ells Narrow is 12 Shillin and the Price of ten elns eln Broad,  15 Shillings, according to the form Supposition, which is one 4th pa more than what it would give of th odinar Breadth. Perhaps some may say, if there w such Difference in the Price of th Broad? and Narrow Cloth, why doth not People make all their Linnen el Broad. If this objection be sustaine 100 such may be brought in, As fo instance, if the Datch who leave some
hundreds of miles from our Coasts, find profit in sending Busses hither to the Her∣ing Fishing: How comes it to pass that our own People who need loss little or no Time in going to and coming from the the place where the Herrings are to be Caught; And in the time of Storm or Tempest may be Livering and Repacking of their Herrings ashore, when the other  Oblieged to ly by. And can mantain ishers and Other Persons imployed for alting and Packing, &c. at easier rates than the Dutch can, Doth not find it their Interest to Apply themselves to such  profitable Labour? together with many uch Queries, to which no Answer can be given; Besides the Folly and Ignorance of these who neglect it: Nevertheless I shal give two Reasons why I judge people eglect to make their Cloath eln broad; The first is, From a Fault in the VVeav∣ers, who usually exact twice as much for working Linnen of an eln Broad as for that which is Narrow of the same Finness; The Reasons they give
for this unreasonable price, Are, tha they not being usually Employed t work Cloath of that Breadth, The want Reeds, and other Furniture fit  working the same; And when they a oblieged to provide such Furniture up on special Occasions, they ndeavour t make the profit of their Labour Re∣compence that Expence; They like wife say, that Cloth of this Breadt requiring the extending of their Arm∣surther than Ordinar, to drive throug the Shuttle, they are thereby muc Fatigued, tho others who mak a daily practice of Working Cloth  that Breadth, find themselves no way thereby Incommoded, as I have hea from several of themselves. And ha farther declared, that they would scar Reckon any Difference between Work∣ing Cloth of an eln Broad, and tha which is near one Quarter Narrower However it be, this Extravagant pric for Working, being a sensible Deburs∣ment to the Employer, and most of People
or having Judgement to Calculate ex∣ctly the Difference of the price of their Broad and Narrow Linnen, with Re∣pect to the quantity of Yearn, of which it is Composed, Generally believing that whatever the Price of the Broad may exceed that of the Narrow, a proporti∣nable quantity of Yearn is required of he one more than the other, and if here be any odds at all, the double rice of Working the Brodest, doth at ast cast the Ballance. The other Reason is, Merchants not nding Broad Cloth ordinarly in the ercats, lay their Account with buying at which is Narrow, and in a manner Confine themselves to such sorts of Lin∣n as they can usually find; And on e other hand, the Linnen Drepers in England, which are in a manner the sole Merchants for that Comodity, laying their Account with no other sorts of innen from this Countrey, than what they have hitherto been in use to get om hence, do provide themselves in
these sorts of course Linnen from Ham∣burg, and other Foreign Places, which we cannot affoord, and buy ou Linne only to sort themselves with some Nar∣row for the use of Boys and Children and the Meaner sort of People. Now upon the former Supposition (which I hope all known in that affai will grant) that two elns of eln Broa Cloth, will yield as much Money, a three of the Common Breadth, provid∣ed they are both of alike Fineness, a has been shewed, one fourth part more Money may be had for the same quanti∣ty of Yarn, which would be 12 Elns Nar∣row if it were made Broad, that is to say 100 lib: Sterling worth Narrow Cloth, would be worth 125 llb: had the same Yearn been made in Linnen of an El Broad. And some think the whole Lin∣nen Cloth Exported from this Kingdom yearly, may be between 2 and 300000 lib. Sterling in value; but let us restrict it only to 200000, the same being made in Broad Cloth would yeild
250000 lib. But because it may be al∣ledged, that some of our Linnen is actually Eln Broad, and Consequently will yeild no more than it doth at pre∣sent, tho the rest were made of the same Breadth likewise; For this I shall allow a 5th part to be deduced offe 50000 lib: supposed to be produced by mak∣ing all our Linnen Eln Broad, more than what it yeilds at present; so the profit hereby arising will be but 40000 lib. yearly, yet when tis considered, that the English and Forreign Customs are exacted by the Eln; not only so much of these Customs will be saved as the Broad Cloth doth exceed the Nar∣row in proportion, which is ath part, but likewise the value of the Broad being a 3d part more than the Narrow according to the number of elns; Whatever the Broad Cloth is bet∣ter than the Narrow bulk, for bulk, (which has been already reckoned,) one 4th part of the value of the Narrow; So much of the Capital Sk payeth
neither Custom nor any other Charg which will at least over-balance, that can be deduced upon Accoun the Broad Cloth at presented expor so that 50000 lib: will still be m more yearly than it now yeilds. To clear this a little further, I sh suppose a Merchant to buy 1200  of Linnen of the ordinar Breadth, 12 sh. per eln, and a thousand elns Broad, at 18 Pence per eln, the Yet of which they are made being alike both, consequently there's no Differe in the bulk or Weight of both parc the Expence of Carriage or Transpo∣tion, and other Charges will be a  in both parcels, save only that of C∣ome, which is exacted by the eln,  in this the Goods of the least val bear the greatest Expence, Viz.  being entered at any Custome Of in England, the Narrow Cloth p 2400 Pence, and the Broad only t Thousand, or if the duty be less more, doth not weaken it the Argume his only being supposed for a Dem∣stration,
(as is likewise the value of the whole Lennen exported) grant him to Sell the Narrow at 15 sh: the Broad at an equi∣volent advance, will yield 22 Pence half penny per eln. Off 75 l. 2 d. per eln being deduced for Custom, (as for other Charges 'tis needless to reckon, seing 'tis only in this, the Broad and Narrow Cloth differ) there remains 65 Lib: which cost at first buying 60, where∣fore the whole profit made of this par∣cel is 5 lib: Whereas the 1000 elns of Broad Cloth at 22 d. half penny per , yeilds 93 l: 13 sh 4 d, from whence deduce 2000 Pence of Custom▪ which is 8 lib: 6 sh. 8 d. there remains 85 lib: 8 sh: 4 d. from which Substract 75 lib: which was the price given for it t first, there remains 10 lib. 8 sh. 4 d. which is 5 lib. 8 sh. 4 d. more profit than what the other parcel doth produce, so much more doth this parcel give Abroad han the other, which because it stands the Merchant dearer than the parcel of Nar∣ow, cannot be Reckoned all Gain to him;
because heought to have profitproportio∣able to his Stock bestowed, yet it is a clear Gain to the Kingdom, for out of thi parcel of Yarn which would hav been but 1200 elns of Narrow Linne and would have vielded no more tha what is Reckoned in the other parcel Yet the same being made in Cloth o an eln Breadth, yields to the Selle here 15 lib: more then it would hav done in Narrow, besides 5 lib: 8 sh. 4  Abroad to the Merchant, the Expenc of Customs being deduced of both from whence 'tis plain that a quantity of Yarn which would make 60 Lib▪ worth of Narrow Linnen, will yield 8 lib; 8 sh: 4 d. when made in Broad, thu the Saving of part of Forreign Customs and the other advantages arising from making of Our Linnen eln Broad, will do more than Compence all that was deduced upon account of a 5th. part o our Linnen, being granted to be e Broad, And for that Reason could b no farther in that Respect improven.
But besides all this, there would be great Advantage many ways by making of our Linnen of a fixed Length, because we could then fell it to Advantage in Forreign Parts, and get in Exchange these Goods at first hand, which we oft times buy at the second with ready Money; neither would we need to de∣end so much upon England for vend∣ing of it, which is without doubt, out Wisdom, seeing they are taking all pos∣sible measures to discourage our Lin∣nen Trade, not only by encouraging Linnen Manufactures in Ireland (which are already come a great length,) and utting off our Traffick thither by im∣ppsing an Exorbitant Duty upon Lin∣nen Imported to that Kingdom, But al∣to have laid an Additional Imposition upon our Linnen Imported to England, and are at present supplied in a great Measure with Course Linnen Yarn from eland, which formerly they used to get from hence, for making of Buttons Gimps and Busines, &c. From a
which it may be easily perceived, that the Regulating of the Breadth and Length of Linnen is very necessary and Con∣venient: But in respect it falls ofte out, that good Laws are not punctually put in Execution; It will be necessary that your Wisdoms do not only Reviv former Laws Determining the Breadt and Length of Linnen, but also that ef∣fectual Measures may be taken for put∣ing the same in Execution, and for tha end, with all humility, I shall offer th following Overtures. First, That there be timely warning given at the Merkat-Crosses an Church-Doors, so that the Weave may have full time to work out all th Webs that they have already Warpe before the Act begin to be put in Ex∣cution, so that they may have no pre∣text of making Narrow Cloth after th time perfixt. Secondly, A Month or six Weeks be∣fore this Law begin to take Effect,  the Heritors or Chief Farmers in ever
Paroch be appointed to Meet and Con∣descend on some of their Number to take a Cirquiet through their several Quarters, to see whether the Weavers have provided Reeds and other Furni∣ture fit for working of Eln Broad Lin∣nen, and where they find any Reeds, Hiddles or Shafts for Working of Lin∣nen, that are not of such a Length as may work Cloth of an Eln Broad, let the same be siezed, burnt and destroy∣ed. Thirdly, At every Brugh Royal and Merkat-Town, let there be a Person appointed fot taking Inspection of all Cloth offered to Sale, and to put a mark or stamp on each Piece which is of the Dementions prescribed, and all Cloth that is offered to Sale without this mark, to be siezed without respect of Persons, the Owner to Forfeit the Cloth, and the Weaver that Wrought it, to loss the price of Working, and the party to have Reparation of him, if the same is already paid.
Fourthly, That there be some p∣sons impowred by the Government, break open all Packs of Linnen offe to be Exported, and if any Cloth  found therein not marked by some the said Persons for that end appoint to seize and Confiscat the same. And further, perhaps it may not improper, in part to determine the pri of Working or Weaving en road Li∣nen; Forasmuchas, the Unreasona exaction of Weavers is no smal hind∣ance to the Working of Broad Clot upon the pretences above mentioned. If therefore it should be ordained th Weavers should exact no more  Working of eln Broad Cloth, than th used to do, for the like quantity of Y in Narrow, and Bailies of Burghs, a Justices of Peace to determine wh any Contriversy shall happen. This  be no ways Unreasonable, for no rea can be given, shewing that three elns eln Broad Cloth will require more Labo than to work 4 Elns 3 Quarters Broa
but one might rather think that 3 Elns of Broad Cloth would require least abour. Neither will it be any consi∣erable Hardship for Weavers to make Utensils for working Linnen of this Breadth, for there will be no need of making of it altogether new, their Reeds and Hedles can be lengthned with great ase, & no other Furniture will need to be changed, the Frame of their Looms being generally, if not all of them, fit for working Cloth above an eln broad. Having thus far laid before your Grace, and the Honourable Estates of arliament. what I humbly conceive may be useful as to the Regulating of e Breadth and Length of Linnen, I all with all Humility put you Wisdoms  mind of a small Treatise, Entituled, e Undoubted Art of Thriving, which offered to you a your former meet∣ing in May last, Wherein I hope is made ar, that this Nation may be greatly riched, by raising a Fund of Credit, nd the great Dislty of Circulating otes  Hazard of Vitiation  removed, I hope
all other Objections may be easily ∣pelled; Yea, I humbly conceive all ∣terial Objections are in the Book it  so enervated, that the perusal of t same will be Sufficent to convince ye Wisdoms, of the great advantage th may thereby ensue to the Nation: N vertheles, for as much as. I have hea two things objected against the said p∣ject, of which I took no special notice the said Tretise. I shall now make a sh reply to each of them. The first is, How is the Nation se∣ed, that so many of these Notes sh be canceled every year as is propose or what security has every Person th may come to have right to the sa Notes, that the said project shall  fail, and every man sustain the loss as much as the value of the Not in his possession amount to, wh ever a subsequent Parliament shall fi this project inconvenient? To this I answer, that for every No or percel of Notes that are given o the managers or Commissioners apoi∣ed for that end, are to receive go
Security from the party to whom they are given out, that he or they shall be furthcoming to the value, with interest so long as the same remains unpayed, and to take the Sufficiency of the Secu∣rity upon their own Hazard; So if e∣ver the Parliament should think the cit∣culation of the said Notes inconvenient there are Sufficient Funds for paying all persons in specie, what Notes are in their Honds; But any who pleases to Consider the Calculation of the expence of Circulating the said Notes, as it is made in the said Treatise, will plainly see, that the expence of Management comes not to above a Tenth part of the interest of the Notes, and therefore this Objection can never take place. The other Objection is, That if such a Project should be promoted, it would be very prejudicial to the Bank, for as much as, these Notes would be transmit∣ted from hand to hand, and supply the Room of Bank Notes. With Submission to your Wisdoms, I cannot Homologat such an Opinion, having alwise looked upon the Scar∣city,
and not the plenty  Money, as prejudical to a Ba For the Bank and the Project propose in the said Treatise are intended for qu different Ends, and serve for quite diffe∣rent Uses. The Bank being intend for receiving Money in specie from Tr∣ding Persons, and delivering out Not to them for their Conveniencie, it being easier for 'em to Exchange a few Paper than to tell over vast Summs of Money in which they are Subject to  overseen at Receipt or Delivery, bot as to the Quantity and Quality. And on the other hand, the Bank is ready Fund to answer the pressing occ sions of Merchants or others, who a thereby presently provided with wha Sums they please for a short time, upo good Security, so that there is no nee for them to keep Summs of Money by them, but may bestow it whenever they can do it to advantage, seing they may depend upon the Bank for Money to satisfie their Creditors at a Choak. B the design of these Notes proposed a
t supplying every one who can give fficient Security, either by Morgages  otherwise, with what Sums they want  Traffick with or imploy in Manufa∣tures, thereby to be improven so as the orrower may make profit to himself, besides the Interest, which he is obliged to pay to the Managers of the National tock proposed, and herein I should willingly oblige the Bank, that no per∣on Borrowing from the said Managers, should be permitted to Repay it till he keept the same a Year, two or three at cast, for it is not the interest of the said office to lend Money for a short time; t that I may Prosecute this a little ather, the promoting of a National Stock in the Terms proposed, will ex∣ceedingly advance the Bank, for not only may the Proprietars of it, receive  much benefit by taking in, and ving out of the National Stock Notes, as they would do of the like alue of Gold or Silver, if the same were immediatly produced; But if they should think that Merchants and Fact∣ors
having these Notes transmitted them, would not trouble themselves give in these to the Bank, and take  Bank Notes, yet such as have Mo∣lying by them, (for so I call these Note and cannot immediatly bestow it to ad∣vantage or secure it in good Hands, w be satisfied to give it in to the Ban till they find how to dispose of it, a on the other hand, others upon press occasions will borrow the same to sat∣fie their Creditors at a Junctur; And fa∣ther these Notes will gradually decre so that in 25 years they will be all Ca∣cel'd, and as much Silver or Gold C in their Room, meerly by the Annu∣rents payed to the National Stock ∣fice, even besides a third part allow for Expence of Management, and oth Contingencys, and what is made  the improvement of those who are t Borrowers: From all which 'tis m evident, the Nation cannot but be gre∣ly Enriched, and as Money encreas the Bank must proportionably be adva∣ced, otherwise the Bank of Engla should be of less value than the Ba of Scotland, and the Bank of Amsterd
than either. And if I might ask a Que∣tion at our Bankes, I could be satis∣ed to know whether they have more ain by a dozen or 20 Merchants, and onsiderable Trading Men in Edin∣burgh, or by 100 or 200 meaner sort of Shop- keepers and Pedlers, and if they say the first, I would fain know why the last might not advance their Inter∣est proportionable to their Number, if they were as rich, of which they would seem to be afrayed, when they speak a∣gainst the project proposed. If it were not for swelling this to too large a pro∣portion, I might add several things to shew the Groundlessness, (not to say Rediculousness) of our Bankers objection. To conclude, I shall be no fatther edious to your Grace & the Honourable Estates, save only to put you in mind, that in the foresaid Treatise, besides the project for raising a Fund of Credit, there are several things proposed for im∣provement of Manufactures, providing for the Poor, and several other things, which I hope may not be altogether un∣worthy of your Thoughts; as likewise
an Overture for Suppressing of Vice a Idleness, which I gave in by it self most of the Honourable Members Parliament; Wherein I humbly rep∣sent, that the Eecting of an Office each Burgh, and in each Parish in t Country, for Recording the Names of a Inhabitants, and Certificats of those w remove from one place to another; a that some honest Men may be appoint to Visit each family therein Monthly, a to make report to the said Office, ea in his respective Bounds, whether the be any Persons residing there, who ca not give satisfying Accounts of the selves, to the intent they may be de with according to their Merit,  which if your Wisdoms think fit to co∣sider, I hope you will find seve things proposed, which may be of go use. That you may with unanim and Concord proceed, and Act in th Session of Parliament as with one sho∣der, in promoving the wellfare of th poor Nation, shall be the earnest Pra∣ers of Your Grace, Lordships and Honours  Humble and Obediant Servant Ja: Donaldson
