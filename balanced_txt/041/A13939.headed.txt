Englande may wayle that euer it came here. ¶ For our wastynge wretchednes / that wades so depe. In our wanton werynge / of clothes to torne To wyldenes & wrathe / the worlde taketh moost kepe.

As tyrauntes and traytours / toyllous in moote Tyll they be tryed out is there no boote And trysed to baratrum / tossed in fere. Englande shall wayle / that euer it came here.
¶ O galaunt vpon galaunt / & o thou galaunt gaye And thou ruskyn galaunt / that pouerte doth menace For all thy warrocked hoode / and thy proude araye And thy parrocked pouche / that thou so fast doest brace. Thou busyest the / to counterfet Lucyfers trace. Thynke not to longe / or thou dwell with hym there For the cursed ensample / that thou shewest here: ¶ So many barefote people / & so fewe good lyuers Hath no man sene / syth the worlde began So many styroppes / and so fewe good chyuallers And so many braynles / that lytell good can Men arayed as women / and woman as man This causeth deth / & that all thynge is so dere Englande maye wayle / that euer it came here ¶ So moche rychesse and araye / and so moche nede So many bedes borue / and so lytell deuocyon So moche fasrynge for hungre / and so lytell nede So moche paynted worshyp / and so lytell reason I trowe no man hath sene / in this regyon Our synne asketh vengeaunce / I am in grete fere. In shorte tyme we shall wayle / that euer it came here. ¶ Howe many poyntes were they nowe a dayes And yet a good poynte / amōge them were harde to fynde Daggers of vengeaunce / redy to make frayes. With longe taters downe to the ars behynde Tryppynge wt small shankes / as lyght as lefe on lynde. To make it toughe & fresshe / as it were the newe yere Englande may wayle that euer it came here
¶ So many purfled garmentes / furred wt non sequitur With so many penyles purses / hath no man sawe. Small gyrdynge in the waste / wt all theyr other mustur That we go all backewarde / from hyghe to lawe Y• florysshynge mede of our welth / we haue begō to mawe But we beseche god / amende vs another yere Or elles we shall wayle that euer it came here ¶ Our women are dyspoyled / & gyue them to wantones Our men with cloutes / at theyr brest lyke a pye Our women haue debated / with shamefastnes And our men with vnclennes / it I shall not lye O englande thou mayst wepe with Ieromye Seynge the people thus ledde by the ere. Englande maye wayle that euer it came here. ¶ Our women in theyr parte / laboure as they may In theyr aray with chere and countenaunce Our men on theyr syde make them fresshe and gay And laboure to purchace / womens pleasaunce Thus bytwene bothe groweth moche myschaunce Eche seketh synne as dothe appere. Englande may wayle / that euer it came here. ¶ Our galauntes lyue / in lustes as beestes. Maynteynours of quarelles / and vnthryftynes. Our shameles women with theyr hyghe crestes Extorcyon / robbery / and our vngentylnes. Prelatis necligēce lordis rauayn & marchaūtis deceytes These asketh vengeaunce / this lesson must ye lere Elles shall ye wayle / that euer it came here.
¶ Beholde these dayes / the people of our nacyon. Are charged with synne / and gouerned by folye. Howe nede wyll compell vs / by transmygracyon With very wo / dryue vnto Babylonye. O englande / where is nowe thy glorye That somtyme shone / thrughe the worlde so clere. Well mayst thou wayle / that euer this sorowe came here. ¶ All people laboure of this newe dysguysynge. In forgynge theyr fantasyes / to maynteyne pryde. He is nowe wysest / that can moost of deuysynge Good makynge of a man is nowe layde on syde This newe araye is brought vp / in this lande so wyde And yet for all that it may not last a yere Englande may wayle that euer it came here ¶ Beholde the rolled heddes / stuffed with flockes. The newe broched doublettes / open at the brestes Stuffed with pectoll / of theyr loues smockes. Theyr gownes and theyr cotes / shredde all in lystes So many cappes as now be / & so fewe good preestes I can not reken halfe the route of theyr marde gere. Englonde may wayle that euer it came here. ¶ These galauntes / vse also full abhomynacyon. Theyr typpettes be wrythen / lyfe to a chayne. And they go haltered in them / as horse in the stable It is a peryllous pronostycacyon certayne For synfull soules / shall be bounde in payne Hande and fote in perpetuall fyre. They shall curse the tyme / that euer it came here.
¶ All these newe bulwarkes / they were at theyr knees They laboure sore in theyr wyttes / fantasyes to fynde No man holdeth hym contente / with his degrees Pryde goth before / and shame cometh behynde Alas that Englysshe men / sholde be so blynde So moche sorowe amonge vs and so lytell fere We may wayle the tyme that euer it came here ¶ Forget not lyghtly / howe many straungers. Haue entred this kyngdome / and kepte the possessyon. Fyue tymes / as wryteth olde cronycles And chaunged our tunges / in sondry dyuysyon. O elergy / praye for our Englysshe nacyon That god for his mercy / of this synne make vs clere Elles we shall wayle / that euer it came here ¶ Effectually pray god / for his reformacyon. Of welth / manhode / and of marchaundyse. And tresoury of peas / that Cryst in his passyon Lefte bytwene god and man / whan he sholde dye. The comynalte in loue / conserue perseuerauntlye With charyte bothe hyghe and lowe to Ioyne in fere In voydynge of synne that tourmenteth vs here ¶ O englonde / remembre thyne olde sadnes Praye god thou maye reioyce / thyne olde felycyte Exyle pryde and releue to thy goodnes For synne hath consumed / this worldes humanyte That thou may resore / agayne to thy gladnes And his blessyd moder / as this lande is her dowere For we haue cause to wayle that euer it came here ¶ Thus endeth this galaunt.
¶ Here begynneth the maryage of London Stone and the fayre pusell the bosse of Byllyngesgate. HErken vnto me / bothe lowde and styll And to this matter / laye to your eere And of your aduyse & also your good wyll Of this lytell prosses / yt after doth appere.

And nowe is dysposed / to be man and wyfe Helpe thē with your charyte / to bye theyr weddynge gere For they be bothe naked / & not worth an halfpeny knyfe. ¶ To you theyr names / I wyll declare If ye knowe ony Impedymente. The one is the bosse of Byllyngesgate of beaute so fayre. And the other London Stone / curtes and gente This is theyr purpose and hole entente To be maryed / as soone as they maye He that wolde let them I wolde he were shente It wolde do you good to se them daunce and playe. ¶ For now ye grete loue / yt is bytwene them twayne. And neyther of them loked other in the face. London Stone answered / full wysely agayne. Where is no loue / there lacketh grace But euyll tunges is so vnmylde And of late hath sayd / in a place where they dydemete ow the Besie of byllyngesgate / hath had a chylde. By the well with two buckettes in bysshop gate strete. ¶ It were able to make ony woman wepe To be so deedly belyed as is the good Bosse. The man is in synnes depe That robbeth her so of her good lose
For to his soule it is daungerouse. Thus sayth London Stone / of prudence so wyse He that in sclaunder / ony wyll dysclose. Of the deuylles rewarde / he shall not mysse ¶ Therfore let my wyfe and me alone. For by my study and wakynge many a nyght. I knowe by the sterres / that shone by the moone. That fayre Bosse / hooly was in my syght And that to my nature / she sholde be coequall. And remayne as my fere / euer in my syght. By the purueyaunce / of the goddes Imperyall To my comforte shynynge as the sterres bryght ¶ Wherfore I beseche you / in humble wyse To reporte the beste in euery place And saye no worse / than maye be to your prayse. Whiche Iupyter had ordeyned of his grete grace Longe or that we came in to this towne For our comforte / and for our solace. As man and wyfe by dyuyne prouysyowne Therfore are we greed to remayne in this place. ¶ Syth the goddes aboue / hath destyned them so. Let vs be mery and thynke howe they daunce For it is a goodly couple of them two. For in theyr behauoure / was neuer founde varyaunce As knoweth all that here be present Whiche brynge the herers / to lyfe eternall. Where god is regnynge permanent Amonge his aungelles celestyall ¶ Finis.
