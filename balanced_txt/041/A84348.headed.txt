A BRIEF OF THE STATE OF THE CASE OF WALTER ELFORDS COMPLAINT Against Sr SACKVILE CROW, which is to be reported to the PARLIAMENT. THE English Factory at Smyrna in Asia being divi∣ded, in December, 1643. some of the party dis∣affected to the Parliament, secretly and under∣hand informed Sr. Sackvile Crow, then Embassador at Constantinople, that Elford had concealed a licentious dis∣course or dispute had between two English men at his Table, concerning the Parliament, and the late King; which in truth he not only reproved, but timely revea∣led: whereupon Sr. Sackvile like an Inquisitor concea∣ling (as he does to this day) the Accusers names and the Accusation, causes Elford to be closely imprisoned 30. months (even till news came of the Parliaments victo∣rious successes) mean time he was put by the exercise of his profession as a Factor, whereby he (before that restraint) gained above 1000 li. per annum. That being not litterally discharged from prison, but only verbally enlarged, the said Elford for fear of anew relaps into restraint, hastily departed from Smyrna, lea∣ving his af fairs there in a confusion, in so much, that he is now necessitated to repair thither to put them in order. Now it is observable, that had not the Parliament then prevailed, Elford (notwithstanding his innocency) had been sent into England as a Malefactor and Trai∣tor, to answer this imposed and feigned crime, where∣with the said Sr Sackvile by his Warrant of restraint had most injuriously stigmatized him.
