AN EPISTLE To be Read In all the ASSEMBLIES OF THE RIGHTEOUS. From G. F. Printed in the year 1666.
An Epistle to be read in all the Assem∣blies of the Righteous. ALL my dear Friends every where, live in the Noble Seed CHRIST JESUS the Saviour and the Anointed One, and the Righteous Holy One, that your Minds, Hearts, Souls, Spirits and Bodies may be Righteous, living in the Righteousness of Christ Jesus in all Love, Virtue, Truth and Ho∣liness, without which none can see God: for the Lord loveth the Righteous, and the Righteous be in Peace, and all workers of Iniquity shall stop their mouths: The Throne of Iniquity must down, and the Chamber of Imaginary in every heart; for the Lord must have the heart, for it is his offering and sacrifice: all lips must be pure, and hands clean, that confess the Lord Jesus Christ, and all tongues and eyes single to God and one another; and all mind the Lord's business in the Truth, and to be given up to him, and in it, serving the Lord God in newness of life; that all your feet may be guided in the way of peace, and to walk upright before the Lord in his way, which is Christ Jesus the Light, which is perfect. This is the way of the Just, which is a shining Light; and in this Way (Christ the Light) is the living God well pleased with you. And you that grow rich in the World in earthly things, who have had a stir∣ring in you formerly in the service of God, take heed lest your minds run into your outward businesses, about outward things, and there∣in be lifted up above the good and just Spirit, and so leave the service of the Lord and his business, in minding your own: for out∣ward riches, and the things of this World, will pass away with the outward riches therein, for they have wings; but the Word of the Lord, which lives and abides, and endures for ever, will remain. Labour for the riches of it, for that will indure with you; and seek the Kingdom of God, which will never have an end, that stands in Righteousness and in Holiness, in which you have joy and peace in
the holy Ghost; then all outward things will follow, which is be∣low; so that in Righteousness, Holiness and Truth, as just men and holy men, and men fearing God, and as righteous men, Sons and Servants and Children of God, you may all live, in all Righteous∣ness, Holiness, Pureness, Truth, Justice and Equity, in all manner of life and conversation; so that your conversations may shine as lights of the World, knowing that all unrighteousness, uncleanness, unholiness, unjustice, untruth and impurity is not of God, but is out of the Kingdom of God; and likewise all Cheaters and Cozeners, who do enrich themselves by falshood; and all Drunkards, Adul∣terers, Whoremongers, Fornicators, Murderers, Idolaters and Ly∣ars, these works and workers are out of the Kingdom of God and his Power, and they be of their father the Devil, who is out of the Truth; and therefore in the Truth live, which the Devil and his works are out of; and that Truth makes you free: in which Truth and Spirit is God worshipped. All violent doers, cursed speakers and swearers be out of the Truth and the Command of Christ Jesus; and therefore live you in the Love of God, in which you may be sensible of his Mercies, in which Love you live, in the pure humi∣lity which you learn of Christ Jesus: for presumption is learned of Adam in the sall, of the Serpent that brought him into the fall, where all the defilement is, and the prophaneness: being in the Whoredom from God, where all manner of Whoredom and Un∣cleanness is, and Deceit and Falshood, the Lyar and all sin and un∣righteousness and transgression: and this is comprehended all in Adam and Eve in the fall, and his sons and daughters, with the Serpent that brought them into the fall, whose head Christ comes to bruise, that is, to break his power and strength, and to crush him to pieces; that is, to destroy him and his works. And Christ is pure, the holy One that doth this, the Righteous One, the Sancti∣fied One, and in him live, the second Adam that never fell; then shall you come to know a state, that will never fall, with me, in that which is first and last; for Christ that sanctifies; he who is pure, sanctifies the impure; he who never fell, sanctifieth and washeth them that be in the fall; he who never transgressed, re∣deems out of transgression; he who never sinned, redeems out of sin, and makes an end of it; and he who never trespassed, comes
to forgive trespasses, and blot them out: and every one that comes to witness this forgiveness by him, who have been the trespassers against God, they cannot but forgive men their trespasses against them, as they come into the Kingdom of Glory and Life, where the Lord hath his Glory. O the Glory of the Lord which lasteth for ever! And Glory, Glory be to him for ever, whose everlasting Glory and Life and Power shines over all, and spreads it self, and puts forth it self over all. O Friends, let Righteousness slow amongst you all, Truth and Equity, Uprightness and Holiness, which becomes the House of God; and live in the holy Order of the Life, Spirit and Power of the everlasting God. Keep in the Faith that works by Love, that parisieth your hearts, the mystery of which is held in a pure Con∣science; which Faith brings you to have access to God, and gives you victory over that which separates you from God. This is that by which you subdue Mountains, and quench the fiery darts of Sa∣tan, and overcome him withal; and in this you have all pure uni∣ty; and you edifie and build up in the holy Faith the Gift of God; and this is that which is to be contended for, which is the same that was once delivered to the Saints. O live in the pure Hope, which purisies you as he is pure; which Hope is Christ, who was before the Hypocrites hope was, who both (him and his hope) are impure; and so feel Christ your Hope, which anchors your immortal soul, that stayes it in all waves, storms and tempests, and is sure and safe in all weathers, CHRIST, who is the same to day as he was yesterday, so no new thing; for he is the Rock of Ages, who was before Ages, who is the Corner Stone, and also the first and last; who will crush and bruise to pieces all giddy wandring and unstablished spirits, and confound them who are cunning, and hunt before the Lord; for the Lord should go before them, he should be the Guide; for they that hunt before him, will not have the Lord to be their Guide who is the same to day as he was yesterday, and so for ever; for Adam and Eve did not abide in their possession, nor Cain, nor Core, nor Ba∣laam; see what came upon them, and what was their end. And likewise the Jews did not abide in the possession of the Law of God, which was just and holy. And also the Apostatized Christians have gone from Christ, and did not abide in him, who is the same to day,
yesterday, and for ever, therefore they are gone into so many wayes, and seek after so many new wayes, and run into so many fables; as though Christ who is obeyed one day, should not be obeyed next day: and this is disobedient Cain, wandring in the Land of Nod, smiting at Abel, who obeys Him who is the same to day as be was yesterday, and so for ever; yea, a Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World: who reigns over that nature that hath slain him, and will reign till he hath put all under his Feet. And therefore, Friends, in Christ live, and in him walk, hear, obey and follow, who is the same to day as he was yesterday, and so for ever. And so you that are the true Believers, who are past from death, and sin that brought it, and the Devil the Author of it, and are come to the Life of Christ Jesus, who (as I said before) is the same to day as he was yesterday, if your belief stands in him that is the first and last, the fame to day, yesterday, and for ever. And this is the Believer that is born of God, the immortal Birth; and this Birth is he that overcomes the World, that doth not sin, and keeps himself, be∣cause he is born of God, and the Seed of God remains in him; and hereby the Children of God, and the true Believers are manifest from the false believers and children of the Devil. He that doth Righteousness is of God; he that doth not Righteousness, is not of God. Therefore you that feel the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus to have put down the law of sin and death in you, that Authority, or putting it down; be ye ordered by the Law of the Spirit of Life that is in Christ Jesus, which makes you free from the Law of sin and death: So in this Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus have you fellowship, order, rule and government in the Law of Life, and in the Law of Peace that gives Victory, which Christ Jesus is the Au∣thor of, who renews you up into the Righteousness and Holiness in the Image of God, out of the Unrighteousness and Unholiness and the image of Satan. Here the Lord hath the glory, and Christ your holy Redeemer and Saviour is confest, to the glory of God. So wait that you may all sit down in Christ, who is the first and the last, and the Image of God and Wisdom of God; that by his Wisdom, which is pure, righteous and holy, you may come to order all things to God's glory. Now Adam fell from that state God placed him in; and in the
fall, Adams sons and Daughters fall from way to way of their own. But for Man and Woman to come out of all the National Wayes, Religions, Churches, Worships, Fellowships and Teachers, to the state that Adam and Eve was in before they fell, and before all those ways, before-mentioned, were; that's a state of danger, where he may fall again: but, to come to Christs stature, and to Him before the World began, who is First and Last, Beginning and Ending, such shall know a state that will never fall. For Adams state before he fell, was above all the earthly and worldly-wise and knowing, and their dark Understandings and perverse Ways, which their perverse Spirits leads into; where all manner of uncleanness, unrighteous∣ness, falsities, puffing up, and pride, and all the crooked, rough, cross ways, and the Mountains of Sin, who are become graves for the Just, and prisons for the Spirit. Adams state before he fell, is beyond all this, who fell into this; but Christ that never fell, is a state beyond Adam, and he is to be heard and followed, that never fell; and in him are People to sit down, who is the Rest and Peace and Life, who destroyeth the Devil and his Works, and makes an end of Sin, together with ungodliness and unrighteousness; which hath dishonoured God; so bruiseth the Head of the Serpent, and breaks his power, and crusheth him to pieces, that the Seed Christ may rise in all, which honoureth the Father. Now this being ma∣nifest and known in all, then the Lamb is known to have the Vi∣ctory, which hath been slain from the foundation of the World; and then in the Seed you come to know your Election before the World began. And here the Lord's Words are fulfilled, his Glory he will not give to another, who destroyeth that that took the Glory it self, which brings up that Noble Seed and Plant in Man which gives the Glory to God. And here as you live in the Seed Christ Jesus, your Election you know before the World began, and Re∣probation since the World began. For Core, Cain, Ishel, Esau, Sodom and Egypt spiritual and temporal, have been since the World began. For Egypt is Thraldom, Bondage, and Anguish and Dark∣ness, and Sodom is Whores, and Cain disobeyed the Voice of God, and Core gainsaid the Law; and whosoever seels all this nature in them, they are Vessels of Wrath; and let thm not complain and say, Why hast thou made me thus? For there are Vessels of Honour,
and Vessels of Dishonour; Vessels of Mercy, and Vessels of Wrath: and it is not in him that willeth and runneth, but in God that sheweth Mercy. Now Esau, the first birth, signifieth a Worker: Jacob is the second birth, signifieth a Supplanter; and when Jacob hath sup∣planted Esau the first birth, prophane nature, Jacob is called Israel, that is as much as to say, Thou hast power with God now. So where the Election is risen, and hath put down Cain, Core, Egypt, Sodom, the first birth slain, which brought all the Wrath into his Vessel, and the old Bottle broken: here is a new Bottle that holdeth the new Wine, and Vessels of Honour, and Vessels of Mercy in the Election, before the World began; And you have all things made new, a New Heaven, and a New Earth. And all Friends that be in any manner of Sufferings, Imprisonments, or Banishments, for Christ and his Truths sake, live in Christ, and sit down in him, in whom you have all peace, life, virtue and rest in Christ Jesus, who was before all that was that makes to suffer, and will remain when it's all gone; and was the First and Last, the Beginning and Ending, the same to day, yesterday and for ever; In Him sit down and live, that doth not change; Then your Religion doth not change, your Worship doth not change, your Way doth not change: for Christ being your Way, who is the same to day, yesterday, and for ever, and your Fellowship and Uni∣ty and Community doth not change, being with the Father who doth not change, but is the same from everlasting to everlasting: And they whose Religion, Fellowship and Worship changes and gads a∣bout, and changeth their ways, are fickle, and have itching ears af∣ter the ways that change from Christ that doth not change, who is the Way, the same to day as he was yesterday, to be walked in. And all Friends that be in any Temptations or Troubles, look at Christ who bruiseth the Serpents head, your Adversary, your Enemy, your Troer, your Tempter, your Defiler, your Accuser, the wicked one, fear him not, but look at Christ Jesus that bruiseth his Head, breaketh his Power and Strength, and crusheth him to pieces; in Christ you have Peace, which was before the Devil was; reign in him, Christ Jesus, who is your Light, and Life, and Salvation; and fear God, and give ory, glory to him for ever; for this Serpent the Enemy, the Adversary, the Devil, the Wicked One, the Dragon,
the Acorser, the Tempter, he tempted Christ to the Creatures, to the Glory of the World, to worship him, to destroy himself; but Christ bruiseth his Head, breaks his power and strength, and crusheth him to pieces, and destroyeth him and his Works; so in him live and rejoyce, in whom you have peace, and life, and dominion, in him who was before the Serpent was, the first and the last, the same to day, yesterday and for ever. Ah my dear Friends and Brethren every where, The Power of the Lord God that is over all, live in, that you may feel a Unity and Fellowship in the Power of the Lord God: that through that Power of the Lord God, you may all come to be Heirs of the Power of an endless Life; through which you may inherit Eternity, or in∣habit Eternity, and so to feel Life Eternal abiding in you, which the Minslayer hath not Eternal Life abiding in him; that is, he that envies his Brother: So all the Persecutors that envy their Brethren, have not Eternal Life abiding in them: Under this all the Persecutors about Church, Religion, Worship, Faith, Ministry and Fellowships, envious Persons, having not Eternal Life abiding in them, are comprehended. Therefore you all feel this Eternal Life abiding in you; And he that hath the Son of God, hath Life-Eternal in him: And so in this Eternal Life, you have an Eternal-Fellowship with God and his Son, and with one another. And in this the Law of Life that is in Jesus Christ, passeth sentence on the Law of Sin and Death in every man and woman, and brings it to the execution. Through which Law of Life Righteousness flows and runs down as a stream, and also Justice and Truth. Here by this Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus (mark, in Christ Jesus) you come to know the Lambs Throne, and the Throne of Iniquity thrown down, its mouth stopped, and the Chambers of Imaginary thrown down, and the Houshold of God raised up; The fruitless Trees thrown down, and the Plant of God raised up, which is of his own planting, a Tree of Righteousness, whose Fruit is unto Ho∣liness, whose end is everlasting Life. So mark here the fruits of this Tree, and the end of this Tree: by this you distinguish man's planting, and then mans plucking up; and God's building you all distinguish from man's building; and man's plucking down, and
man's gathering together, you that are gathered in the Name of JESUS distinguish, and their scattering: Oh therefore be valiant for the Truth, which you are come to the knowledge of, and worship God in that Truth that the Devil is out of, and abides not in; this makes you free from the Devil and his works, that be out of Truth. Here in this Worship, in the Truth, and in the Spirit, the li∣ving God, who is a Spirit, the God of all Truth, he hath his glo∣ry and his honour from the Spirit of the Lord in every heart: and so keep in the Spirit and Truth and Power of the Everlasting God, who is from everlasting to everlasting, that you may know him Lord of the Earth, and of Heaven, and of the Heaven of Heavens, Ru∣ling and Reigning, whose eye is over all his Works, that you may glorifie him in his Power and Spirit, and serve him in the New-Life; which will keep you over all mens Fables, and Devices, Whimsies and Imaginations, out of all Janglings and vain Dis∣putes of men of corrupt minds; and so for you all to live in that which is the same to day as was yesterday, Christ Jesus, the Power of God, and the Seed of Life, and Word which was in the beginning; so no new thing, but that which was and is to all Eternity: Let your Fellowship be in that, and your Unity and Communion be in that; for this is seen by the Eternal Eye, the Eternal Unity, and the Eternal God. So hear his Voice every one of you that speaks from Heaven, whose Voice shakes the Earth, and not the Earth only, but Heaven also. The Heaven signifies Joys: So all the false joys, the lifted-up joys, or exalted joy, and joys in vain-glory, and joys in the World, or any outward thing or creature, and men or women: His Voice that speaks from Heaven, shakes the Earth and the Heaven; and this must be shaken and removed, both the Heavens and the Earth, before that do appear that can never be shaken, the Noble Royal Seed, elect and precious, before the World began, being Heirs of Him, come to inherit Him. In Him you shall know that which cannot be shaken, and there is the true Joy, the standing Joy, in that which is from everlasting to everlasting, who is the beginning and ending. Here is not any either listed up or fallen down to despair. So I say, hear his Voice, harden not your hearts: for not hearing the Voice, you harden your hearts, and then you provoke God to wrath and sore displeasure. Let him have your ear
that speaks from Heaven, till you come to observe his Counsel, tea∣ching Instruction and Direction for all the Prophets and holy men of God: and the Apostles were attentive and obedient to this hea∣venly Voice, who witnessed to the Truth, who had a witness in Heaven also; and such declared forth the glorious Truth which they had from the Inctructions of the Almighty, as you may read throughout the Scriptures, what glorious Expressions and weighty Truths they declared, whose ears were attentive to Him that spoke from Heaven, and how also they declared against them that stopped their ears, and closed their eyes, and hardened their hearts: For such whose ear is not attentive to the heavenly Voice, but to the earth∣ly; and so if the earthly, and the sin and evil have the ear, it will fill it with that which is bad, and harden the heart, and choak the good; therefore the Lord must have the ear, who is the Ruler of Heaven and Earth. And as your ears are attentive to the Lord's Voice that is from Heaven, Iniquities mouth is stopped in you, the Throne of Iniquity is thrown down in you, that is the wicked spirit and power where Iniquity sits, and the chambers of Imaginary are thrown down in you, where all thoughts & imaginations are. As the ear is attentive to the Voice of him that speaketh from Heaven, you will come to the Throne of the Lamb, which is the Power, who hath the Victory and the Dominion, that all may live there in the ever∣lasting Power of God, that goes over all deceit; which was before deceit and darkness was; and alway feel a growing in the Power of the Lord God, that is universal and everlasting; that you may be all Heirs of the Power of an endless Life, and come to inherit it and possess it, and sit down in the possession of the same; that every ones lot may fall in the Land of the Living, where the Lord hath his glory and his honour for ever and ever. O the Glory, Glory of the Lord, that spreads it self over all! and here you have his savour, and can taste your meat in the Power of the Lord God, feed∣ing upon every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, having every ear attentive to his Voice. In this you grow up in the Life that is Eternal. THE END.
