The Young-Mans Complaint for The Loss of his Mistris. Young-men you see my Fortune is such, I have lost my Love by loving her too much: My fortune's bad as other Young mens be, Read but these Lines, and you shall Plainly see: I being bashful, she was something coy, I have lost my Love, which should have been my joy. To an Excellent New Tune, I have lost my dear Mistris. COme hearken Apollo my pittiful groan, Of all loyal Lovers that is left here alone; I'le fight for my true Love though Mars be my Foe, For I've lost my dear Mistris by being too Slow. How Lovers are often tormented in mind when as their own sweet-hearts proves to them unkind Though many that hears me the same would forgoe, I have lost my dear Mistris by being too Slow. I would I had ne'r seen her, that I had ne'r been, That I for her Love now sorrow have seen: But my heart it with sorrow my senses or'e-go, That i've lost my dear Mistris by being too Slow. When as we were Children we loved most dear, But now of that Love I am never the near: My heart is so sad and oppressed with woe, That i've lost my dear Mistris by being too Slow. When unto years elder our Youth did it spring, Then to Complementing I straight did begin: Yet bashfulness daunted and shamed me so, That I lost my dear Mistris by being too Slow. Quoth I my dear Honey though I cannot wooe, Yet slight me not for it for loving of you: Intirely I Love thee, the truth it is so, Then do not refuse me by being too Slow. At Fairs and at Markets you know it right well, hat I in your Company still did excel: Neither car'd I for Money nor time it is so, Then let me not loose you by being too Slow. But she gave me Denial and bid me be gone, For all I lamented and to her made moan, aying, I would not have you any more to do so, For you have lost me plainly by being too Slow. The Maidens Answer. THough company together long time we have kept. One another, my mind and my heart is set, Though one not so handsom as your self must go Away with me, and leave you by being too slow. You are young and youthful, and may be may have A mind on a woman, but do not deceive Your self any more by neglecting it so, For you have lost me plainly by being too slow. I would have been married before now e're long, At fourteen in truth I could wish't had been done: If thou'd willing been then to Church with me go, You need not have lost me by being too slow. But you did neglect your time sore in that case, For a woman can tarry but while time doth last: For at fourteen she is ripe, there is few but doth know So you fool'd your self then by being too slow. So adieu to you young-men, you hear how it is, And all the frail ways how my fortune I miss: But it shall be a warning unto me I trow, That i'le never lose more by being too slow. O Cupid thy Arrows are tip'd with pure Gold, And it strikes me quite thorow when thee I behold; But like to Amintas, I made my Moan so, When I lost my dear Mistris by being too slow. But like to Leander i'le mourn for my love, Through new lands & countries, & constant i'le prove I'le Drink and i'le Fuddle 'gainst who dares say no, Since I've lost my dear Mistris, by being too Slow. You Godesses assist my Fortune being such, For I have lost my Sweet-heart by Loving too much: But it shall ne'r fret me although it be so, That I have lost my Sweet-heart by being too slow. Good Cupid assist me that now I may mend, And cause my heart strong to continue to th'end: And go along with me I will bear thy Bow, So Cupid but hit them that they'l with me go. So Young-men if that they stand, you must strike, Not one way in forty that more they will like: That they'l call you honey and with you will go, And love you most dearly for useing them so. FINIS.
