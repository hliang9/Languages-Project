His Majesties Speech to the Maior, Aldermen, and Commonalty of the Citie of Oxford. Mr. MAIOR, IT being in this City, whereof you are under Us, the immediate Gover∣nour, We should think it fit to deli∣ver Our intentions to you in the first place, but that the affaires for which We caused both you and these wor∣thy Gentlemen to be summoned, tends to one purpose and effect, and therefore in common Wee shall give notice to you of Our desires, which surely (so good a confi∣dence have We of your loyalty to Us and Our Cause) We shall not be readier to propound to you then you to will be prompt to accomplish. But would heaven had been pleased to have so disposed of the businesse of this Our Kingdome, that We had never had any cause to make these Propositions to you; Wee should rather then have indevoured to have augmented your estates by Our bounty, then have any wayes diminished them by Our necessity. But there is no resisting
the Divine pleasure, whose judgements are inscrutable, and who for Our offences, and the sins of Our people, hath been pleased to inflict on this Our late happy Land, all the mi∣series which can arise from a civill war, then which no grea∣ter can be contingent to mankind▪ for to behold brothers killing brothers, fathers their children, and children their fa∣thers; to se the honest and well gotten goods of divers sub∣stantiall men of Our Kingdome taken violently from them, and by their fellow-subjects, acquain and friends; to view houses and townships fired and plundered, certainly are spectacles of as much horror and pity as can be presen∣ted, to dazle, and, as it were, make men sicken at the eyes by reviewing such lamentable objects, and all these in this Our Kingdome are daily conspicuous, which is now so much more wretched and unfortunate, by how much it hath been in times past, happy and flourishing, war and tumult being the more dreadfull and oppressive to Our Subjects, because they have beene rarely, and not these many yeeres seene among them, peace having so long been the Genius of this Island, whereas in the Low-countries and Germany, where the people are inured and habituated to military troubles, they indure them with even a naturall patience; as birds, who from the nest taken and put into Cages, sing there as cheerefully as if they were at libertie; those oppressions by custome being made tolerable to them, which to Our Subjects appeare insufferable. And We may justly protest to you, Gentlemen, We are more afflicted at the sufferings of Our people, then forty for Our particular grievances, though surely but few Kings of th or any Christian Kingdome whatsoever hath under∣gone the like disgraces and afflictions that Our See hath one: First affronted at Our owne Palace, and driven away from thence, and consequently from Our Parliament which th given life to all these ruines) by a multitude even of the est sort or Our owne Subjects, since which time We have  Our Magazines seised on and imployed against Our
Selfe, Our Navie detained from Us; nay, We Our selfe de∣nyed entrance into Our owne townes, unlesse Wee would contract Our traine to the appointment of Our Subjects; witnesse Sir Iohn Hothams usage to Us at Hall; and besides, Wee have undergone many wants of the due appertain∣ments to Majesty, both in Our house-keeping and other wayes, being reduced to more exigents then divers private men; many of Our meniall servants refusing to give their attendance on Us, and We, in a mockery of fortune, forced to goe from place to place to beg assistance and reliefe from Our owne Subjects. But God in his good time will give an end to these troubles: in the interim, We must as well as We can, provide for Our defence, and the safety of those who depend upon Us: Our Parliament and Wee cannot yet be reconciled, though for Our part We should beg no other happinesse of heaven, no greater benefit in this life, then to have all differences attoned betwixt Us; for whilest we are at this variance, whosoever are gainers (which certainly are but ew) We are sure to be loser: Wee lose Our Roy∣alty in losing those additaments and supportments which should sustaine it, being debarred the benefit of Our Ex∣chequer revenues and custome; Wee lose Our strength in the losse of our Subjects (the strength of Kings) and Wee lose that which is more pretious to Us then all things else, Our peace and quiet of mind, never free from cogitati∣ons of Our peoples injuries and Our owne sufferings; so that We are even growne old in the vigour of Our yeeres by this continuall perplexity of care and troubles, which when they will arrive to a happy conclusion puts Our augury to Judge, though no indevour of Ours shall in any wise be wanting that may speedily terminate the mi∣sery of these distractions: But in the meane time Our Par∣liament hath of Us infinite advantages; they abound in money to pay their army with, whilest Ours are  to maintaine themselves (as it were in charitie to Our ser∣vice)
at their owne cost and expence; the Parliament having daily brought into Guildhall for their use (as Wee are surely informed) plate, money; and other conside∣rable aids of horses subscribed for, not onely from all parts of the populous and wealthie City of London, but also from divers of the adjoyning Counties, as Hertford, Essex, and such like; so that they cheerefully may undertake these warrs, having so long a stocke of coyne to sup∣port them. A sad and unhappy accident it is for Us, that Our owne Subjects should with such willingnesse part with their estates, nay, lives against their Soveraigne: And surely, should these fatall wars (which heaven avert) con∣tinue long, the very money which is in the power and at the dispose of the Parliament would sustaine them a∣gainst Us, and be a maine blow to Our Cause, We having already made what shifts We can possible with Our honour for the advancement of monies for these our wars, & yet are We neither so well furnished as Our occasions require, nor can they last long without some new supplyes. The cause then why We sent for you, Mr. Mayor and your Brethren, & for you Gentlemed, the High Sheriffes and Justices of this and the neighbouring Countie, was to let you have a true understanding of Our urgent necessities, that by the know∣ledge of them you might be excited as much as in you lyes, to endevour Our reliefe, which Wee conjecture you may effect to some proportionable quantitie of money, if you Mr. Mayor and your Brethren, will summon together all the able men and heads of your Citie, and to them plainly infer the wants of Us their Soveraigne, and induce as much as in you lyes (according to the example of the Citizens of London, for the use of the Parliament) to contribute everie man what money, plate, or horses, his abilitie can spare to furnish Our occasions with, yet Wee would not have you mistake Us in this matter, nor lay this as an injunction upon
your Citizens, which We only intended to intreat from them as the testimony of their loves; for that were to invert and alter the state of Our meaning quite, and it would give a large cause to them, who without any reason at all, forge occasions to scandalize Our proceedings, to exclaime that where the King could not borrow money by faire meanes, there He took it by force, as divers have already untruly re∣ported of Us; for never will We of a King, the Protectour and Defender, turne the robber and destroyer of our good Subjects: No, let everie man, as the Israelites in the wil∣dernesse to the building the Ark of the Testament, offr with a willing mind what hee pleases; neither directly or indirectly, by force or threatning language, fright mens con∣tribution out of them: not that Wee did ever intend to re∣ceive as a gift, what Wee intend only as a loane, and will with all integritie, on our Royall word, see honestly re∣paid to the uttermost farthing, and We hope our good Sub∣jects here will as soon take our Royall word for their securi∣tie, as they at London have done, the publike faith for those vast and almost incredible sums, which have been raised for the maintenance of the Parliaments Forces: We are confi∣dent We shall pay as honestly as they shall ever bee paid there, though Wee are not altogether so wealthy. God in his good time will restore Us to our owne, and then Wee shall have meanes sufficient to pay all our debts. This is all, Mr. Mayor, Wee have at this present to say to your selfe and Brethren: And what is spoken to the Gen∣tlemen, Wee would have you conceive is uttered to you; Wee would desire you our two Sheriffes of our Counties of Oxford and Berks, and you the Justices of Peace of our said Counties, to intimate our said request to all the Gentlemen of abilitie, and Yeomen of our said Counties, our wants are perspicuous and obvious to your understandings. Nor can there be a more noble addition to the honour of your loyal∣ties, than that posteritie shall report of you, that you relieved your King in his necessitie. And for our after resentment
and remembrance of your fidelitie and courtesie to U Leave that to Us, to think and determine of. And last of all, Wee request both you Master Mayor, an you Gentlemen, to be as speedy as you can in the pursuit o this businesse; and so returne Us your answer. It will bee the last time We shall trouble you in this nature. Wee verily beleeve; for Wee hope a speedy reconciliation betwixt Us and our High Court of Parliament will give an nd to these wofull distractions, in an happie peace; and then Wee shall take care to repay these moneys, and provide for all our peoples well-fare. FINIS.
