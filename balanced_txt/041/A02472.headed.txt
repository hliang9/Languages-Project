LONDON: Printed for Thomas Archer, and are to be solde at his Shop in Popes-head-Palace. 1613.
Winter) and hauing past them, at last after he had trauelled sixe Moneths together, he arriued safely at Constantinople: Where, vpon the first day of May, 1612 he had audience giuen him by the great Emperour of the Turkes, to the great honour and reputation of the Netherland Prouinces; and of the States ge∣nerall of the same: The Solemnitie whereof was in this manner performed. The Ambassadour was conuayed vnto the great Turkes Court by Saphiler Aga, the chiefe Comman∣der of all the Turkes Horse-men: and Siaus Bassa, principall of all the Gentlemen in the Turkes Court; accompanied with an hundred Siausers all on Horse-backe, in such and the same manner, as they vse to fetch and conuay the Ambassadours of the greatest Monarches and Kings that are, vnto his Court. The Ambassadour hauing encreased his Traine with some Netherlanders as then resident in Constantinople, by reason that at the same time, there lay diuers Netherland-ships before the towne: and besides them, with some that were his good friends, both inhabitants, and others of other Nati∣ons, whom he before had knowne: whereby the ho∣nour of the Netherlands was preserued, to the great contentment not onely of the Turke himselfe, but also of all the Bassas of his Court. The olde Captaine Bassa, for a signe and token of great affection and honour, caused the Ambassadour to ride vpon his owne best Horse, which was most sumptuously sadled & brideled, wherin the Turkes, aboue all other Nations, doe specially shew their pride & power. And so in great solemnitie the afore∣said Siausers, or the great Turkes Gentlemen, richly
clad and apparelled in Cassockes of cloath of Gold, Veluet, and Sattin, tode two and two before him: after them followed their Seruants, and some Ianit∣sers afoote, with two Dragomans, or Interpreters, on horse-backe: after them followed the Ambassadour, accompanied on each side, by the afore-said Saphiler Aga, and Siaus Bassa, and his owne followers, who as Gentlemen, (after the manner there) doe also kisse the great Turkes hand, and in that manner rode with a great applause and concourse of people to the Serralio, or Palace of the great Turke. In this manner entering into the first gate of the Serralio, Siaus Bassa left the Ambassadour, and rode forward before him to certifie the Bassas of his com∣ming. In this first Gate there stood about 60. Capit∣sers, or great Turkes Porters, with their Captaine, for a watch. Then approching to the second gate of the Serralio, the Ambassadour lighted from his horse, and was led in thereat by the arme, by Peichijs Bassa, principal of the Pages, apparelled all in gold, whose office is to conduct all Ambassadours vnto the pre∣sence of the great Turke: before this Gate there stood about 100. Capitsers, with 4. Captaines for a Guard, & within the gate, were about 300. Soubassas, which are Captaines of the Ianitsaries, each hauing a long white feather, like a Peacocks feather, on their heads. There all the Bassas lighted off from their horses, and went on foote to the Diuano (which is the Counsell-Chamber) wherein all the Bassas, with the principall Visier (representing the great Turkes Person) foure dayes euery weeke giue open audience to all sutors, and determine all causes of the whole Empyre.
Hauing past through this Gate, on the one side of two long Galleries, supported with Marble Pil∣lars, there stood Ianitsarie Aga, the chiefe Commander of all the Ianitsaries, and of all the foot-men of Turky, with 10000. Ianitsaries: and on the other side, Saphiler Agas, the chiefe Commander of the horse-men, with 2000. Saphers, or horsemen, who altogether bowing downe their heads after the Turkish manner, with great reuerence, saluted the Ambassadour, he doing the like vnto them. There met him the Kihaia, or Commander of all the Capitsers, and Siaus Bassa, both of them being great Personages: they two led him into the Diuano, going before him with two long staues or wands of siluer and gilt ouer, richly appa∣relled in cloath of Gold, which is the greatest ho∣nour that can there be done to any man in the great Turkes Court. In the Diuano sate the Cahimachan, with all the Vesier Bassas, who are chiefe and principall Counsel∣lers to the great Turke. Opposite ouer against the Cahimachan, there was a stoole set for the Ambassa∣dour. On his right side (which by the Turkes is held to be the vnworthiest, as being vnder the sword of another) sate Mahomet Bassa▪ Admirall of Turky, betrothed to the great Turkes eldest Daughter, Da∣hut Bassa, marryed to the great Turkes Aunt, Ioseph Bassa, Chelil Bassa, and Nischanzi Bassa, marryed to the great Turkes Niece, whose office is to set the great Turkes name to all Letters Pattents, and publike Instruments that are granted and sent out by him. On the other side of Cahimachan (a resonable or in∣different space being left) sate the two Cadileschers, or chiefe Iudges of the whole Realme of Turky, and
on a seate alone the great Treasoror, being a Vesier also. Ouer against him, in a chamber, apart, there sate about 300. Secretaries or Clarkes of the Tre∣sory, each of them being Auditors of a seuerall Pro∣uince, and vnder them their Clarkes. The Ambassadour hauing for a while spoken and conferred with the Bassas, there was foure round sil∣uer tables brought in whereof one was set between the Ambassadour and the Cahimachan the second be∣fore the other Bassas: the third before the Cadileschers and the Treasoror, and the fourth before the Nischanzi Bassa and his company: and there they were feasted in sumptuous manner, with many sorts of meate, serued in great porceline dishes, setting but one dish downe at once after the Dutch manner. The Am∣bassadour eating with the Cahimachan, Captaine Bassa, and Dahut Bassa. In the middle of dinner, each of the Bassas, and the Ambassadour dranke Sorbetta, in dishes of gold, which is a kinde of drinke made of Water, Suger, and iuyce of Lemonds, mixed with Amber and Muske: whereof they dranke but once, & no more: for the Turkes are very sober drinkers, and the great Lords vse to drinke no wine. The Mutpac Emini, or the great Turkes chiefe Cooke, hauing vnder him aboue 2000. Cookes and officers in the Kitchin, stood to serue at the table, and below him stood about 100. Teschnegers, or waiters, all with Cassockes of cloath of golde, setting the meate vpon the tables, and seruing at them. Of them the Beies, that is the Gouernors of townes, and Barons are made. The Cahimachan gaue the Ambassadour the first cut of euery dish of meate, meane time the Gentle∣men
many precious Stones, all the Chamber being han∣ged about with most costly Hangings, embrodered and imbossed with Gold, the ground being Crim∣sen Veluet: the top thereof framed like a round tabernacle, all couered ouer with Golde, with di∣uers kindes of workes therein: this Chamber (be∣ing not very great) (when it is decked and hanged richly for to giue audience to any Ambassadour) is esteemed and valued to be worth tenne hundred thousand Hungarian Duckets, in English money, at seauen shillings a Ducket, 350000 pounds. When the Ambassadour came before the great Turke, one of the Capitser Bassas tooke vp the skirt of the Turkes Gowne, which the Ambassadour stooping downe, kist: and then hauing done the ac∣customed reuerence vnto his Maiestie, two of the Capitser Bassas led him backward to the side of the Chamber, where in the side of the wall there is a eae furnished with rich Hangings and Cushins, but it is not the manner that any Ambassadour doth sit downe in the Turkes presence. The two Ca∣pitser Bassas stood still by the Ambassadour, then the Dragoman was led before the great Turke, and brought backeward againe by the Ambassadour, and after them the twelue Gentlemen orderly one after another: that done, the first Visier or Cahi∣machan, read a Petition before the great Turke, thereby briefly beseeching his Maiestie, gratiously to vouchsafe audience vnto the Ambassadour. After that, the Ambassadour made an Oration in Latine, which by the Dragoman was presently interpreted in Turkish speech: and to when the Ambassadour had deliuered his Letters of credit,
together with the propositions afore-said in wri∣ting in a Bag of cloath of gold, according to their accustomed manner, by his Interpreter, to the Ca∣himachan, he was led out of the Chamber againe, doing the accustomed honour and reuerence vnto the great Turke, going backewards as afore-said, without any answer m he Turke himselfe, or any of his Bassas, it  not their manner nor cu∣stome to doe it: and t went out with a great num∣ber of Courtiers and Officers, vntill he came out of the gate aforesaid, on both sides saluting Ianitser Aga, and Saphiler Aga, being by them, and the Ianit∣saries and Saphilers likewise saluted as before. It is to be wondered at, that in the Turkes Court, when they sit in Counsell which is ordinarily foure dayes in a weeke, there assembleth at the least 30000. men, all in pay and wages vnder the great Turke, be∣sides the Bassas, who stand there so quietly, and with so great silence, that in a manner they shew to be so many Images, without life or soule. The Ambassadour with his traine, being on horse-backe againe, they were led a little aside (as the manner in that Country is) to see the Court and traine of the great Turke passe along before them, partly to honour the Ambassadours, and part∣ly to shew the great Turkes Power. And first, all the Ianitsaries about 10000. in number, with a great noyse came out of the gate, and marcht before him, well apparelled, but without weapons. Then fol∣lowed 500 Solachijs, or Bulucbassis, which are Cor∣porals and other Officers of the Ianitsaries: then a∣bout 500 Soubassis, with long white feathers vpon their heads, which are Captaines among others.
Then on Horse-backe followed Stampol Aga, being the chiefe of all the Samoglanes, which are certaine young men and Children, which are giuen to the great Turke tribute: then the Perchimalgis, Ianigse∣ris, Iagischijs, the Clarke of the Ianitsaries: Solach Bassas, Commander of the Solachijs: Tagerschij Bassa, chiefe Hunter to the great Turke: the Chahagraby, or Lieutenant to Ianitser Aga, and his Substitute. Then on foote followed 200. Soubassis, and then Ia∣nitser Aga himselfe, Commander ouer all the Ianitsa∣ries: after him followed 100. Menegesians, all with Girdles of Siluer about one of their hands, which also are Ianitsaries, and each of them carry a Torch before the Aga, when hee goeth the round by night through Constantinople, as all the great Visiers and Bassas night by night are bound in person to goe the round, to preuent an such as seeke to doe any hurt or mischiefe, each of them hauing an Executioner with them, to punish all those that they finde doing any hurt or wickednesse, or that are in the streetes, according to the desert and merit of their offences, eyther by present death or otherwise. All the great Turkes Court hauing in this manner passed along before the Ambassadour; hee was againe conducted vnto his Lodging as aforesaid, and for a further ho∣nour, there was by the Bassas sent vnto him, two Pei∣chijs, or Pages, belonging to the great Turke, wea∣ring siluer and gilt Hats whereof there are alwayes a great many going about the great Turkes Horse, who although they are not accustomed to waite vp∣on any other man, no not vpon the great Visier Bassa, yet they followed the Ambassadour, on eyther side of him as hee was on horse-backe, till hee came to
his Lodging. For this Amitie and Friendship made betweene the great Turke and the vnited Nether∣lands, all the Turkes in generall much reioyced, so that as then it seemed to be a day of triumph, and from that time forward when the said League was first begunne to be made, they beganne to treate a∣bout the releasing of the Netherlands out of captiui∣tie, as also touching negotiation and traffique, to the which and, now already commandement is sent by the great Turke into Barbary, and other places, to declare the Peace made betweene the Netherlands and the said great Turke, and to command them, that from thence forth the Netherlands shall by them be holden and esteemed to be his Friends. This Treatie with the great Turke (for the which the Lord be praised) concluded and agreed vpon, with the greatest honour and reputation of the Nether∣lands that may be deuised, being made and signed with the great Turkes owne hand, and with his Oath thereunto annexed, was deliuered vnto the Ambassadour, vpon the sixteenth day of Iuly last past, being by him before for the space of sixe dayes perused, read, and in all defectiue places corrected and amended, in the presence of certaine men that vnderstood the Turkish Language, and were reque∣sted thereunto by the said Ambassadour. By which meanes the Netherlanders haue obtai∣ned the best and surest Priuiledges in Turky, that euer heretofore haue to any Nation beene granted: for whatsoeuer the French-men, English-men, and Ve∣nitians in generall, or any of them in particular, by the Turkes speciall fauour and grace, haue obtay∣ned of him, it is all specially set downe in their re∣capitulation,
amitie and friendship, were presented vnto Vs. The con∣tents and substance whereof were, that vnderstanding the Maiesticalnesse of Our Royall and Princely State, you were moued and incited to seeke for Our intire Friend∣ship and good will: and to shew your great desires there∣vnto, haue endeuoured your selues to the same end to write vnto Vs, and to make an Accord and Friendship with Vs, which might alwayes be holden and obserued, declaring that your wils and desires haue alwayes beene good and great in that respect, to seeke and craue Friend∣ship at Our Imperiall hands; and to shew and declare your good affections vnto Vs in like sort, and in the same man∣ner as other Kings haue done, which with Vs haue entered into League and Friendship; desiring to be holden and ac∣counted among the numher of those Kings that are Our Friends: and that Wee would grant vnto you Our Let∣ters of agreement and consent therein, in such manner as Wee haue giuen the same to other Kings of Christen∣dome. Which that it may be done with sinceritie and truth, together with other things which you further de∣sire and require at Our hands; (whereof the Contents being imparted vnto Our Royall Councill, and hauing fully and wholy vnderstood your wils and meanings) We ef our Imperiall Grace and Fauour haue abundantly gran∣ted and giuen vnto you by Our Letters Pattents, not one∣ly the same Priuiledges and Liberties which Wee haue in times past imparted to the Kings afore-said, according to your owne desires, but ouer and besides the same, much more then you eyther haue sought or desired by your Let∣ters of Vs, which with Our owne hands, Wee haue by Our Letters Pattens confirmed, and giuen commande∣ment from Our Maiestie, that in all places and Countries of Our Empyre, wherein any of your Country-men and
Subiects shall be knowne and found to be Slaues they shall be freely set at libertie, according to the Contents of Our said Letters Pattents of Amitie, Peace, and Friendship. Further Wee giue you to vnderstand, that your afore∣said Ambassadour hath with great honour and modestie, as also with great care and diligence, performed and done his dutie and seruice in his said Ambassage whereof hee was sent by you, in all things hauing obtained the bene∣fit of Our Friendship; and in good manner and fashion hath performed the same: and when he came before Vs, was permitted by word of mouth to speake and pro∣nounce the Message and Commission by you giuen vnto him, to be deliuered vnto Vs, which Wee hauing vnder∣stood, as also well liked, allowed, and accepted of, together with the Presents by you sent, and deliuered by him vnto Vs, (and which We will keepe in Our owne presence and continuall sight) hauing receiued the same, as also the said Ambassadour, with great Loue and Friendship. The auncient custome of Our Maiestie is, that all Our gates of grace, fauour, and good will, shall stand continually open for all, and vnto all men, and at all times; but especially to those that come vnto Vs with so great a desire of faith∣full Friendship, to whom it is requisite to shew and impart all honour and good will that possible may be. Therefore Wee say, that you hauing receiued these Our Letters, from thence-forth (as it is requisite) Wee looke and de∣sire that you shall hold and obserue the Treatie and Friend∣ship made by you with Vs, perpetually; according to your owne Letters and Offers sent vnto Vs, and in the like man∣ner and forme, as the Kings of England and France Our Friends, long time vnto this day haue held and maintai∣ned the like Friendship and Amitie. Which Wee hope you will doe in all points according to your Promises,
and that our Friendship may continue and hold firme and stable, Our desire is that you should from time to time eertifie vs, by Letters, of your estates and healths, and Wee for Our part, will not faile to fulfill and accomplish all whatsoeuer shall tend vnto your good and welfare, with all fauour and grace, as neare as Wee can: and promise you further, that our good will and friendship shall not cease continually to encrease towards you, for your good, and from good to better; whereof We would not haue you to doubt.

And therewithall his Imperiall Maiestie hath commanded that wee should set downe and record the Articles of agree∣ment and vnite on both parts, according to your de∣sires, and also to make and send you a Letter in his owne Name. And I also for my part, as your good friend, haue written this Letter; which, with his Maiesties, wee send vnto your Honours, wishing that by Gods grace, and in an happy and prosperous houre, the perfect Amitie and Friendship knit betweene vs, may in like sort long con∣tinue, which with all my heart I desire: for it is most sure and certaine that the supreame Lord of the noble house of Ottomans, and the Imperator of all other Rulers and
Lords in the World, our most Puisant Lord and King, is so truely vnited in fast and firme Friendship with your Honours, that from henceforth all the Fauours and Ho∣nours that may proceede and be imparted from his Im∣periall hands, vnto his Friends and Well-willers, shall be giuen and shewed vnto you, as by the Capitulation and agreement set downe and recorded he hath fully ma∣nifested and recorded, in such manner that all promises, and conditions, made and specified to be graunted vnto on his behalfe, within his Kingdomes and Dominions, shall be truely and faithfully obserued, fulfilled and kept. And my selfe your good friend, in like manner, will not faile to shew you all the honour and respect that may be, and will by no meanes endure that the least hurt or wrong whatsoeuer, shall be done vnto your Honours, (in your Subiects or Vassals) within these our Countries, for that the Word and Promise of our most righteous and ho∣nourable King, (whom God preserue) is for euer firme and stable, and most powerfull, in regard that his Ma∣iesties minde hath beene, and is alwayes addicted vnto peace and quietnesse, and specially desireth that his peo∣ple should liue in vnitie and peace, that vnder the shadow of his Imperiall Maiestie, they may so liue happily and at hearts ease. And seeing that the Lord of all the world hath granted you so great fauour and happy fortune to be vnited and ioyned in friendship, loue, and amitie with so puisant great and magnanimious a King, replenished with benignitie, grace, mercy, and compassion, as our Empe∣rour is: It is most certaine, and you may assure your selues thereof, that his Commandements and promises are firme and most sure, and that there shall be no contra∣rietie found therein, and assure your selues for certaine, that it shall not faile in any manner in regard that his
be a meanes to procure the welfare of all Gods creatures, to their euerlasting benefit and good. Wee for a conclu∣sion say, that if on our side, all the Articles of agreement and Amitie, set downe and specified in the Treatie con∣cerning vs, and also all that which on your sides is promi∣sed, concerning the peace, in your Letters, be well per∣formed, maintained, and kept, according to the inward and affectionate friendship shewed and proffered by you with heart and good will; that so in time to come, all our affaires may the longer and the better haue good and hap∣py successe, wee hope and trust in GOD that in all the parts of the World, where Kings and Princes raigne, and shall heare and vnderstand of the Friendship and Peace made betweene vs, those that are our Friends will reioyce thereat, and such as with-stand the same shall feele the smart thereof. God bring this our proceeding to good end, and for your good and prosperitie. Concerning your Ambassadour afore-said, whom wee must commend, we say, that not onely touching his Am∣bassage, but also in all the rest of the things belonging to matter of Estate, both in generall and perticular, hee hath done and performed the same with as much care and diligence as in him possible was, sparing no labour, tra∣uaile, nor care, neyther in place nor matter, nor in any of his proceedings omitted any thing whatsoeuer, which he knew, or by any meanes perceiued, to be needfull or ne∣cessarie to be propounded or moued, to bring these af∣faires to a good end. And specially comming into the pre∣sence of our most Puisant Emperour, (whom God pre∣serue) hee appeared there before him, with such honoura∣ble behauiour, grace, and curtesie, that it pleased his Ma∣iestie exceeding well, and moued him thereby to take great pleasure and contentment in him: and in all his
actions hath so behaued himselfe, that more could not haue beene done, not required at his hands concerning his charge. And to conclude, such a personage as hee (in the Superlatiue degree,) is fit to be an Ambassadour: in such sort, that all the Lord Visiers, my fellowes, and the rest of the Lords of the Emperours Court wondred there∣at, and said that such a man that should deale in publike affaires, ought to be such a one, as he shewed himselfe vn∣to vs to be: being altogether in great admiration to see his manner of proceedings in all his affaires, and for that cause, being so well pleased and contented with his beha∣uiour, were well content that hee should haue daily ac∣cesse vnto his Maiesties Court. Your Honours shall doe well to esteeme much of him, for that a man of his de∣serts and qualities meriteth to be preferred. Thus hauing at this time, no more to say (hauing made a true relation of all that hath here beene done and past) but onely to wish health and long prosperitie vnto your Honours: wee leaue to trouble you.

For that the great Turke will shew your Honours such friendship, that in his Empire of Turky neyther you, nor any of your Ships, shall neede to feare any hurt or harme to be done vnto you in any thing whatsoeuer. To conclude, wee all together will continue your perfect friends, and be friends to your friends, and foes to your foes: and the further that you proceede therein, so much the more shall the benefit of his Maiesties fauours be seene, and your aduantage procured thereby, and in this matter which by you hath beene sought, all fauour and Friendship afford vnto you, although that in this point it is not vnknowne vnto you, how many aduersaries you haue had, who by all meanes and wayes possible, haue sought to hinder your proceedings herein, and to diuert it, that it might take no effect. Therefore as I haue said, seeing that your enemies haue wrought thus secretly against you, it is great reason, that this League and Contract should be surely made, and ac∣cording
to your Letters, the Articles haue beene set downe, certifying you, that all shall be done as you de∣sire: and with all wee thinke that it was great reason that this peace should be established, and therefore our most puisant Emperour hath beene content gratiously to ac∣cept of your Friendship, and according to your Letters, the afore-said Priuiledges haue beene granted vnto vs: and that in all things whatsoeuer past concerning them, there hath nothing beene omitted that was requisite to be put in according to your desires. And for your Am∣bassadour Cornelius Haga, whom your Honours sent hi∣ther, hee hath performed his charge in that respect (in the Superlatiue degree:) and with great grace and ho∣nour gone through therewith, and hath executed the same with as much diligence as possible he might. Where∣fore I must needes say, that such a man as he is, deser∣ueth as well to be made an Ambassadour, as any one whatsoeuer of his degree, being of that Iudgement that hee is: the reason is, for that whatsoeuer hee hath done concerning this businesse of yours, hee hath done it ef∣fectually, and therefore it is requisite, that you take care, that no scandall may hereafter be procured thereby vnto you, and before all things to doe your endeuours that this Peace may continue firme and stable, for that it is euery way profitable and good for your Honours, and your townes. And vpon condition that your Honors shall keepe and firmely hold this Treatie, wee also will endeuour our selues to maintaine and vphold the same for euer: for our great and most Puisant Emperour (whom God preserue) is a courteous Prince, and exceeding gratious, and shew∣eth all the grace and fauour that he can vnto his friends, being an Emperour of great Honour and Maiestie, whose custome is alwayes to doe well.
The Conclusion therefore of our Letter is, that what∣soeuer hath beene concluded touching this peace, you will take care to performe it to your powers. Moses Ieru∣salmi a Iew, hath beene a great furtherer of your affaires, as much as in him lay, and hath made mee acquainted with all your proceedings. Peace be with you all. THE SVBSCRIPTION. By him that executeth the Commandements that are sent forth to be done for the honor and authoritie of the Puisant and most Princely house of Ottomans, Mehemet the Sonne of G. Saalteldin. God haue mercy vpon vs all. FINIS.
