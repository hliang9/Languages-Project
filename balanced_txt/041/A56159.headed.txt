The Stationer to the Reader. Reader, I Have with much importunity (after many deni∣als) obtained and published a perfect Cata∣logue of all Printed Books and Papers of Se∣veral Subjects, Kinds (besides many other Treatises yet Un-published) written by William Prynne of Lincolns-Inne, Esquire; not out of any vain glorious Ostentation of the Authors indefatigable industry, and manifold good services to this Church, Kingdom, Parliaments, and our Kings themselves (whose Rights and Liberties he hath alwaies Vindi∣cated, upon every Emergent occasion, against all Oppo∣sites and Underminers, to the losse of his own Liberty, Estate, and Hazzard of his Life, without the least thought of recompence or reward) but for these two principall Reasons. First, To free the Author from those old & new Spurious Impostures which have been injuriously
fathered on him by Walker the Ironmonger, Saun∣derson, and sundry other Imposters, to his Dishonor, and the Readers Delusion. Secondly, To prevent all Imperfect Catalogues, and to discover what Copies of his have been published by Erronious Manuscripts, varying from the Ori∣ginal, without his knowledge, (by some who aimed more at their own private benefit, then the publick) his only end in compiling all these ensuing Treatises, being only Gods glory, the publick good of our Church, State, King, Kingdom, and preservation of our Re∣ligion, Laws, Liberties, Properties, Government and Parliaments Privileges, against all Underminers of them by force or fraud, not any private gain, he freely giving his Copies to those who Printed them; and dis∣bursing above one hundred pounds out of his own purse, to publish and disperse sundry of these Treatises and Papers for His Majesties and the Parliaments ser∣vice, and his Countries publick good, when none durst undertake to print them, for fear of utter ruine, by U∣surping, Arbitrary, tyrannical Civil and Military pow∣ers. If thou reap any Information, Consolation, Reformation or Edification by any of these Publi∣cations, let the Author enjoy thy Prayers and just Respects, and his Stationer thy Custom.
