A KEY TO THE CABINET OF THE PARLIAMENT, BY THEIR REMEMBRANCER. Printed in the Year, 1648.
A KEY TO THE CABINET OF THE PARLIAMENT, By their Remembrancer. NOw since it is my fate to take upon me this office; I thinke it not amisse if I be∣gin to shew the manner of their com∣ming in to that (once) renowned House. First, they bring with them a Certifi∣cate from the Sheriff of the County, or Bayliff of the Burrough, for what place they serve; and this they produce to the Clerke of the House of Commons, or his under-Clerkes, who then procure a Commissioner to give them the two Oathes, viz. the Oath of Allegiance, and the Oath of Supremacy, so paying their Fees are admitted into the House: Let them remember what great obeysances they had use to make to the Chaire, which shewes that they are but persons put in trust by their Country to make Intercession by an awfull Complyance with their King; and they were no sooner set there, but they fell on with such Gigantine blowes, as that they made even Majesty it self afraid of their passionate fury,In the first week of their sitting, that worthy Gent: Sir Thomas Jer∣mine said unto the Pages that were playing the wags upon the staires, Boyes be ye tempe∣ate this will prove a whip∣ping Parlia∣ment. and then cun∣ningly
and fauningly glose and Court their Country Masters, and if any quarrels arose in respect of Elections (as indeed there were very many, and tis observable the most factious among them all, and I wish they were not the greater part of the House) they ordinarily referred the debate to a Com∣mittee of Priviledges, where after a great deale of doe the party most fit for their turnes right or wrong commonly car∣ryed it, a thing not out of fashion stil, or else there could not be so many of the Army get in, some of them such inconsiderate fellows, both in indowments of minds, and fortunes, that its no wonder we see no better daies nor more accomodation: for tis observable that the chief sticklers in all these grand de∣signes, are for the most part men who have been forward Committee men in the Country, to raise and extort monies from their fellow Subjects; or else Souldiers of fortune, that for their cruell murdering, plundering, and robbing, have been cho∣sen by the industry of their Jesuited Priests, as Peters, the late Saltmarsh, Dell, and others, who upon the taking in of any Towne that send Members to the Parliament, if it were a hun∣dred miles off, Peters would not saile to be there; and be sure to fall in with all the Faction of that place: and by Prea∣ching and seducing them, obtaineth such a one to serve as may be most fit to promote their ambitious party. Then Peters comes riding up to the Towne in all haste, happy are they that first met with him, is called into the House, and tels them of his good service, and of their successe, and they with a bounti∣full hand bestow upon him 100. l. at a time: (Liberall Masters, that can tell how to cut large thongs out of other mens hides) and Ile undertake that by his roguery in those wayes, he has gotten in these distracted times Thousands of pounds, which he cannot deny no more then he may the distracting of a poor woman at the English house in Roterdam; who while he was Preacher there to the English Congregation, Preached such close Doctrine into this woman, that out of the sense of that abominable sin, she did despaire and fell madde, to her ever∣lasting shame; and then this Rogue ran away thence, and so
for New England, then to Ireland, then to England againe: for there's not a part either beyond Seas, or at home, where the Anabaptisticall faction raignes but he has influence upon very highly, and so propagates the seed of the Saints, that he is a meere Stallion to the Sisters, and I thinke you'l acknow∣ledge him a fit Chaplain for such a Parliament as now we have, for be there any State Baudry to do, be it to make a marriage between both Houses and the City (as he himself cals it) Oh how he bestirs himself, Christ Church can scarce hold him, there we must have a whole herd of Citizens so formally gathered together in their Gownes, lifting up the yolkes of their eyes in an hypocriticall posture of Devotion, a man would blesse himself to see so much vilainy harboured in such a house as that is, which was consecrated for Divine worship; to be thus made a Theater to act and mold the State villanies 'as hell it selfe can invent; and then forsooth the Parliament Members, and the Major, Aldermen and Citizens, must feast together at the poor common Citizens charge: there must be no healthes, no, these are but shooing hornes to drunkennesse, but feed and taste abominably of the creature, then throwing the glasses and pots up and downe the room, and laughing and fooling like so many Gypsies or Mummers, and by and by at a Grace halfe an hower long, and then a Psalme, after that an Exhortation which must be fraighted with malitious and Trayterous ingredients for the de-throning of the King, or keeping Him from comming home. So that we can have no peace, and then bethinking themselves of such a rich Malig∣nant or the like, who is not so forward in Gods cause, how they may bring them unto a Committee of Examinations at Westmin∣ster, and then to Cambden house and so to Goldsmiths Hall; and tell me are not these fine kind of Holly-dayes? and have not they reason to suppresse all Holly-dayes instituted formerly by the Church for the service of God, and for some refresh∣ment to young people? What need is there of any Playes? will not these serve well enough, especially when they have got∣ten Hillyar Swansted the Player to be one? I dare say these
sorts of meetings have cost the City since this blessed time of Reformation at the least 2000. l. at severall times. But if the Citizens entertaine the King but once in halfe a score years at the most; if He doth not grant them what they list, He shall be sure to be told of it in a publique Declaration, as He was served the last meat they publickly gave Him: Oh how cour∣teous were they to Him when He came to Guild-Hall to de∣mand the Members, were they not ready to pull him in pieces out of His Coach? did not Bard and Browne in Cheapside, Mainwaring that broken Rascall, Ven that cruell Tyger that hath eaten up Windsor, it is unspeakeable what wrong he hath done the Inhabitants of that Towne; besides the irreparable prejudice to the Kings Royall Castle there, and was there not some reason thinke you, for such kind of vermine as these to make all this stir? was it not known how all these fellows were ready to fall into Newgate or some other Gaole either for debt or other nefarious Crimes? and have they not been well rewarded for these their good affections? did not Main∣waring receive large rewards, when besides Colonel of a Re∣giment of Red-coates at the beginning, was made Ticket-ma∣ster? worth the best part of a 1000. l. per annum, which lasted for severall years, then a place in the Custom-house, after that another place at Dover, yet for all this, this Religious Gentle∣man lyes a prisoner in Execution for above 10000. l. debt in the Kings Bench; his conscience not permitting him to pay his debts, saying, he holdeth not himself bound to pay his debts out of the monies he hath gotten in the times of War; have you heard of such arch knavery? view but the rest of them, there's Browne, must have his Coach, and truely a Cart would better become him, he and Bard were partners, commonly called Horse-stealers, I meane Horse Lysters, marke these fellowes, how glorious they are; how they glitter in apparrell; what houses they dwell in, while other moderate men sit downe by extreame losse, finding themselves much exhausted of their Estates, and still must expect to bleed as often as our Grand Chyrurgions at Westminster please to open their veines.
And now I hold it fit to remember the Parliament, how at the beginning a little before these Wars, that they or some of them imployed Mr. John Lilburne, and others at Wapping and other places thereabout to stir up the Seamen, and madde multitude to come up to Westminster and abuse the King in his owne house, using such base language as no private man (much lesse the person of so gracious a Prince) could endure: this is that which begot all the misery, this made the King forsake the Parliament when his life was in such hazard: here begun our evil daies: I had not mentioned this had it not layen so much in my way, and had I not known that Mr. Lilburne him∣selfe has spoken it, and will justifie it when they dare to que∣stion him. From hence proceeds a deadnesse of Trade; Shops shut up on purpose to enrage the poorer sort of people, and all must be then construed as if the King had a mind to over∣throw the Parliament; Straffords head they had hurried off before; the manner of that proceeding against him hath been spoken already by others. Then let me tell them at Westminster how they laid aside all private businesses, here they begun to shut up the Com∣mittee of Grievances when they had received thousands of Petitions, (no where reliefable but by a Parliament) and de∣ny it (if they can) how many times since that they have opened and shut this Committee, as if it were good manners to play at boe peepe with their fellow Subjects in the administration of justice, and how many Chairemen have they made since that; causing continuall attendance to the vast charge and un∣supportable burthen of the Common-wealth. Their Grand Committee of Religion they then shut, & set up another in the roome, which they call a Committee of Plundering Ministers, & well may you call it so, for there was never such Plundering, Robbing, and ruineing of so many Orthodoxe Divines in the greatest persecution that I ever read of, and why all this but because they would not take the Covenant, and become invol∣ved in their Trayterous State net, perjuring themselves, and dishonouring and destroying the face and beauty of that re∣verend
Government, which no Church in Christendome could (before they laid on their Sacrilegious hands) in any measure parallel: I tremble they dare to remember how many of these poor Ministers have heen wracked by their Serjeants at Armes, putting their Deputies to worke to haunt these men, who al∣though for the most part are more mercifull then their selves, yet they allow them no fees but what they are forced to ex∣tort from these poor Gentlemen, while they sell, give or di∣spose of their livings for their owne ends, and is it not their fashion to countenance all the complaints, let them come from never so meane and evill bred Raschals, where upon the bare averment of two such like fellows, they out them of their Be∣nefices, and what do they with these Livings, do not they en∣quire after the worth of them, & then bestow them upon such who can best advance their cause? do not they Cloath their mock Synod of Divines with these stolne garments, and give the best unto such as can promote their cause? so that dulnesse and profanenesse in a great measure abounds: have they not by this meanes, by the setting up of these thunderbolts, cheated the people out of their Allegiance, and taught them more he∣reticall Seditious principles then ever was heard of? we need not talke any more of John of Layden, the Anabaptists of Munster, New-England, or Amsterdam, they maintaine one Minister John Goodwin in Colemanstreet, who of his Congre∣gation (as he cals it) can hold forth such new principles, or rather indeed old heresies, and broach them in every Sermon that for ought I see he is able to cudgle all your Assembly into as much silence as your new Vice-Chancell or of Cambridge was in the other day,Hill Master of Trinity Col∣ledge. who being to preach a Sermon in St. Maries, and having named his Text and talked a while was not able to go forward, nor backward, and so came down, and the Novices mist that dayes portion, which perhaps might have poysoned them for the time of all their ages. And is it not their custome when they are at a stand that their State Charriot wants wheeles, to set these fellowes at worke, as they did by your London Ministers at Sion Colledge, on Tuesday last
past where the maine matter in charge to them was that they must the next Sunday be sure to admire the Parliaments wise∣dom, their great care in the preserving our Liberties, their great bounty in giving the City a new Militia, the restoring of the Aldermen from the Tower, and to glew the two factions to∣gether against the Royall party, and you Mr. Alderman Cul∣ham, are not you a pretty pidgeon to whine so pig-like in your severall Petitions, acknowledging your errors at first, and so was spared from going to the Tower, which indeed was too much honour for you, to be so neere to the society of so many Heroes, so many gallant men; who for their love to their King and Country lye there and laugh at them; whom you fall upon your knees to: and are not you a very foole to buy your Liberty so deare as you did? when had you but staid a little, two or three Counties Petitions had struck off the shackles, and the Prison doores had opened to you; Oh what a harmony will there be on Sunday next amongst the Godly Ministers all of one tune, that will be a day indeed, and in faith if that daies worke do not take, their condition will abate very much, their supercilious lookes will be humbled: they will be glad to hear their fellow Subjects without Petitions, I say without Petitions that must be stuft with such particulars as may most conduce to their ends, which they call the peace and welfare of the Kingdome; for if there be any thing that savours of any regard to the King, Oh how mad they are, they grin, how they stinke like Polecats in a Gyn; your blood boyles, your hearts prick you, your Consciences accuse you, their nefarious Villanies flye in their faces, what a terrour is the Law to them? Thinke you not that all men well in their wits laugh at them to see how they eat their words, how they Vote and un-Vote, constant to no one principle they ever de∣clared, and are they not every day inventing some new Jigge or other to make the poor swaines dance after, and when they have pumpt their selves drye, Oh how convenient a thing it is that they have a Fast, and their Pulpies and their Presses admire their unwearied and indefatigable paines, Oh what
Balsome, what Oyle is this to their tender consciences; if this be not true, why are we told on it so often by their Mer∣curies and Stage-players, for indeed we need not any more Stage-playes, we thanke them for suppressing them, they save us money; for Ile undertake we can laugh as heartily at Fox∣ley, Peters, and others of their godly Ministers, as ever we did at Cane at the Red Bull, Tom: Pollard in the humorous Lieute∣nant, Robins the Changeling, or any humorist of them all. And now let me cast about and see what kind of instruments they imploy to doe their businesse, are not the Committee men in the severall Counties of the Kingdome of their owne setting up? are they not the fire-brands of all the people in the Kingdome? who have they not Cheated, Robbed, Impri∣soned, or Plundered, if they could be but guessed to be any whit Loyall? Nay Ile put it further, have they not dealt so by their owne friends, those that have contributed to their shirts to serve them? are not the people ready to cut the Committee mens throats, and if they did, do you imagine any honest man would be sorry? have not they for these actions occasioned all our late and present fears? have not the Parliament while now heard of their insolency? were they never told of it? surely yes, by thousands: but it is just that at length their hearts should be troubled; for I wonder who (if honest, truely Religious, fearing God and his Anointed) that have escaped their Clawes; and now I thinke it not amisse if I tell you of a true story of that particular Committee of Kent, which is as followeth: Francis Owens a Merchant Stranger of London, about this time four years having received at Maid∣stone in Kent the summe of 200. l. in Silver, and comming to the Crowne Inne at Rochester, to refresh himself and horse: The Committee was as it seemes then and there sitting he a stranger borne, and scarce able to speake any English at all, the Committee would needs know of him where he had this money; he Answered them as well as he could speake, at Maidstone, but desired them that some one of them would speake to him in French, they answered him nothing, (yet Ile
be deposed there were hardly six of sixteen of the Committee but could speake it, and I thinke old Sir Henry Vane that was then there is not to be excused) they got out of him by his in∣nocency that he had received this money of one Turner; which Turner as it seemed was then a servant to the Lord Ten∣ham & a Papist, and was Imprisoned at Maidstone for Recusan∣cy, upon this apprehension, the Committee would suggest that this money was the money of the Lord Tenham (who was then in France, and a Cathoilke, but went to Travaile with leave, and so a Delinquent no more then by the knowne Law) and would sequester the money, and so very fairely tooke him into a withdrawing roome with three Musketteers, they sear∣ched him for more money, Captaine Lee one of them said, its probable you have gold about you as well as so much silver, they then pulled off his doublet, searched under his shirt, un∣der his armes, the coller of his doublet, between his leggs, may they search't all places about him, I cannot civilly name the places, but never Midwifes could be more private; they tooke away from him his Watch, and very bountifully allow∣ed him seven or eight shillings, which was in his little pocket to carry him home, and so with many jears and scornes let him goe. There was then of that Committee many of those that are the grand Authors of this Combustion, as Blunt, Lee, Weldon, Lucey, Godfrey Walsingham, and many more, who I have now forgotten. By this very one act you may perceive what a deale of hu∣manity there is amongst these fellows, what strange and dan∣gerous businesses might have ensued upon this, when a stranger and a Merchant cannot at noone day go about his businesse, but he must be Robbed of his money, by them that would be thought the great preservers of the Common Interest, and might have made very dangerous fractures abroad in other parts, had not this Gentleman been a patient man; if you de∣sire to know the truth hereof, the party dwelleth in St. Tho∣mas the Apostles parish, and is every day upon the Exchange. Three years and more he was out of his money, made severall
journeys for a year & a halfs time to Westminster, sollicited all the Clerkes, and made all the friends his money could pur∣chase to be righted in this busines, procured honest Sir Simon D'ewes, to move it in the House, shewed two severall Affida∣vits made in Chancery, besides Mr. Owens owne, touching the propriety: The Deputy Lieutenants, as Captaine Lee, and Sir Thomas Washingham was then by, (as the Devill would have it) and opposed Noble Sir Simon, and that snarling Cur Sir Henry Mildmay, perceiving that the House were well plea∣sed that Owens must be cheated out of his money; began to question Sir Simon for moving on the behalfe of a Papist; a base and mungrell fellow who has no more Religion then a Redshanks in him, nor so much humanity; wherer's thy Reli∣gion Sirrah, thou Jewell of Traytors? Thou that betrayest thy Master our gratious King every day; thou that art the perfectest villaine above all the rest of the Covent, where was your Religion when you were found — with one of your Maids? remember how your wife scratch't your face, and you durst not shew your head for a moneths time in the House of Commons, but he is so base that my pen cannot speake him: But Ile leave it to you my Country men, if you are not in a miserable condition, when your lives and fortunes are under the disposall of such men as these are. Awake, awake, why sleep you? remember how they govern, even as the great Turke doth; even by force, by an Army, nay but they were so just, I may safely avow that since they hunted the King away from White-hall, there hath been more horrid acti∣ons committed by them, then have been by the Turkes in their Empire for the space of forty years, 'tis not unknowne un∣to Merchants what a strickt course they take there with those that attempt to violate the honour of the grand Seigniour, the bowstring, smothering, boreing through the nose, striking off heads, quick worke there, yet here we have a company of Saints that point-blanke dare declare against the Person and Government of the King: but see the book Intituled the Re∣gall Apology answering their Declaration, I say see how they
are bassled, how their impostures are unfolded and refuted; behold their hellish mallice to their dread Soveraigne, com∣pare the Answer with the Declaration, and then if thy consci∣ence be not convinced, I must say, thou art blind; thy heart is hardened, thy God thou hast not served, his holy spirit (I am afraid) thou hast rejected; but if thou shalt satisfie thy selfe herein, Oh then what canst thou thinke of these men; how canst thou account them, are they a people fit to com∣mand thee, lay thy hand upon thy heart, and thinke whether ever English men thus suffered under such inferiour men, having nothing to countenance these kind of actions more then the word Parliament; looke ye Citizens about ye, see how at Sea they desert them, no lesse then ten of His Majesties owne Ships have delared for Him, and three Castles in the Downes Likewise, see how the poor Welch have strugled their share and continue still; see Kent their Loyalty, I wish they had more discretion then to meddle without a head, a Com∣mander in Chiefe, a wise company of sollid Soldiers for a Councell of War would do well; behold Essex although be∣trayed and retarded by Warwick, and by Sir William Hicks, and Sir William Martin (since run away) yet are the Royall party up still, and are at the least this day 5000. of them, 2000. Horse, remember Yarmouth, and Norfolke, you will quickly hear of them; behold how pettily they keep the Committee in Essex still in prison, now let them Vote themselves out, as they had wont to Vote their neighbours out of their moneyes, goods, and fortunes: Remember Cambridge shire horse, and their motions, Sir Lewis Dives in Huntingdon shire, a 1000 Horse under him, and Kimbolton Castle to boot, Lincolne De∣clare for the King, and a goodly and brave Army in the North, under the Command of those two brave twins of true Che∣valry Sir Marmaduke Langdale, and Sir Thomas Glenham, & if you stir not now I shall ere long tell you your own as well as I have the foresaid Saints, and know Ile be your Remem∣brancer too by Will: Pullens leave, and shall tell you more truth at once, then he shall in a whole year for his fee, (al∣though
though he thirsts so much after the morning Lectures.) The ship the Antilop being summoned (whereof Bowin is Captaine) by the Earl of Warwick at Portsmouth, the Cap∣taine came a shoare, and while Warwick was treating and se∣ducing him with the Ordinance of Indempnity, the Ship went into the Downes and Declared for the King. Three small Ships at Portsmouth secured, by the E. of Warwick, Severall ships a∣broad suspected to joyne, with the revolted ships. The Kings party incite them to it, and expect Letters of Mart from the Duke of Yorke to take Merchants good, and ships; and my Lord saies he's come into these parts to try whether he can doe more service then he could doe there, being the half way to the Downes. FINIS.
