The Case of several of the Band of Gentlemen Pensioners, and Band of Yeomen of the Guard, Servants to King Charles the Se∣cond, humbly offer'd to the Honourable House of Commons. THAT the Parliament in the late Reign, by an Im∣position upon Tobacco and Sugar, raised a Summ of Money for paying the Wages or Sallaries due to the Servants of the late King Charles the Second. That there were several Payments made in the late King's Reign, but a great part of the said Salleries or Wages remain'd unpaid; but since their present Majesties happy Ac∣cession to the Crown, that Fund was appropriated, all ex∣cept Sixty Thousand Pounds to other Uses, which Sixty Thousand Pounds fell short of Payment of what was inten∣ded to be paid the said Servants by the former Act. That there is also due to your Petitioners, several Wages and Sallaries from his late Majesty King James, all which appears in the Account annext to the said Petition; And whereas your Petitioners, and many others in the same Im∣ployments, in the present Reign are turned out of their places which they purchased, to the ruine of many Families, without receiving what was and is still due and oweing to them, though they never were charged with any inqualifi∣cation, or other matter or thing which in any wise did or doth render them uncapable for the Offices or Employments they were in. The equity of all which is humbly offer'd to the Consideration of this Honourable House.
