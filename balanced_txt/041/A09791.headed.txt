¶Tho. wyatis translatyon of Plutarckes boke / of the Quyete of mynde.
¶To the reder. It shall seme harde vnto the parauen∣ture gentyll reder / this trāslation / what for shorte maner of speche / and what for dyuers straunge names in the storyes. As for the shortnesse aduyse it wele and it shalbe the plesaunter / whan thou vn∣derstandest it. As for the straūge names stycke nat ī them / for who that can take no frute in it / without he knowe clerely euery tale that is here touched / I wolde he shulde nat rede this boke. Farewell.
¶To the most excellent and most vtuous princes Katheryn / quene of Englande and of Fraunce &c. encrese & contynuaunce of moche helth and honour. The boke of Fraūces Petrarch / of the remedy of yll fortune / at the cōmaunde∣ment of your highnesse / I assayd / as my power wolde serue me / to make into our englyss. And after I had made a profe of nyne or ten Dialogues / the labour be¦gan to seme tedious / by su{per}fluous often rehersyng of one thyng. which tho {per}a∣uenture in the latyn shalbe laudable / by plentuous diuersite of the spekyng of it (for I wyll nat that my iugement shall disalowe in any thyng so aproued an au¦ctour) yet for lacke of suche diuersyte in our tong / it shulde want a great dele of the grace. Altho / as me semeth / and as sayth this Plutarch / the plentuousnesse and faire diuersyte of lāgage / shulde nat so moch be desyred in suche thynges / as the frutes of the aduertysmentes of thē / whiche in my opinyon / this sayde Plu∣tarch hath handsomly gadred togyder / without tedyousnesse of length / contay∣nīg
the hole effect / of that your hyghnes desyred of Petrarch in his lytell boke / which he wrate to one of his frendes / of the Quiete of mynde / nerawhyt erryng from the purpose of the sayd Petrarch. which I haue made now of late ī to our tong nat p̄cisely (I cōfesse) wtout errour as one shulde haue done that had ben of perfite lernyng / but after my rudenesse / seking rather the profite of the sentence than the nature of the wordes. but how¦soeuer it be / if it may please your hygh∣nesse to accept it / it shall nat onely be a defence for the symplenesse of the boke / agaynst ouer busy serchers of other mē∣nes act{is} / whan the good wyll shall haue the alowance of so vertuous a iugemēt / but also corage to the symple endeuour of this hande / towarde better ent̄prises. And tho the smalnesse of the present be great / in respecte of that / that accordeth to your exellence / the sentence parauen∣ture shall nat be moche vnacceptable / if it greue nat your grace to marke it after your accustomed wysdome. Pleseth thā your hyghnesse to pardone thouerbold∣nesse of your moost humble slaue / where he presenteth you / for the good lucke of
this newe yere / with this his symple la∣bour / and with as moch quiete of mynde as this boke pretendeth / alwayes pray∣eng god to sende you thonorable desyre of your vertuous hert. At Alyngton the last day of Decembre. M.D.xxvij. your most hūble subiect and slaue / Tho. wyat. ¶Of the Quiete of mynde. I receyued very late thy letter / wherin thou exhortes me that I shulde write sō¦thyng vnto the of the quietnesse of mīde and of those thynges / in Timeus / that thou thynkest nedeth more exquisite de∣claration. Trewly / where as Eros my frēde was redy to sayle towardes Rome and I had receyued hastely of Fūdanus the honest man the letters / & I had nat therfore leysar to apply me to that that thou desyredest / as I wolde haue done / nor agayne coude I suffre the man to be seen sent fro me with empty handes / cer¦teyn chosen thynges I haue taken forth of the quietnesse of mynde / out of the co¦mētaris that somtyme I made. And (as I thynke) ī such declaration thou sekes
nat the delicacy of sayeng / and the piked delight of spech / and thou hast consyde∣ratyon onely of some doctryne / to be as helpe for the lyfe to be ordred. & I iuge it very well doone / that where thou hast great priualte with princes / & that nat in cōmen thing{is} / & that ī the glori of ma¦ters of iugemēt / no man is afore the / yet for all that thou dasyst nat folysshly at the fawnyng of glory / that wōders and exaltes the / as doth Merops in the tra∣gedy. Oftimes also thou remēbrest that thou hast herde / that sore toos are nat e∣sed with gorgious showes / nor the whit thlowe with a ring / nor the hedach with a crowne. For to what purpose is thuse of money for the eschewyng of the sicke¦nesse of the mynde / or for the easy & sure passage of lyfe? Or wherto serueth the vse of glorie / or among courtiers appa∣rēce? Onelesse that they to whom these thyng{is} chaūce / can wisely vse thē whan they haue them: and agayne whan they want thē / ouer suffre the desyres of thē. and what any other thyng is that / than reason accustomed and fore thought / to restrayne quickly / & nat to suffre to stray the apasionate parte of the mynde / wan¦tyng
reason / whan it breketh forth / and to suffre it to forbeare whan it is ouer∣twharted / with assayling affections. Therfore / as Xenophon bad men in pro∣sperous thynges chefely to remēbre the goddes / and to worshyp them than best / that whan case required with bet hope what so euer they nede they myght aske of thē / therby contented and mercyfull. So those princyples that are most mete for to apese troubles / must be taken and receyued afore hande / onely of thē that are hole mynded / that long afore prepa∣red / they may be long moost profytable. For lyke as feyrs dogges ragyng at eue¦ry voyce / yet at one voyce that they are vsed to and knowe / they apese thē selfe. So the wood affections of the mynde / it is no lytel busynesse to order and apese / Onlesse the princyples for that purpose vsed / be familier and redy at hande / that may clerely appese them / whan they are troubled and mued. Fardermore / they that are of opinyon nat to do many thin¦ges / nor uatly nor opēly / for the quiet passyng of lyfe. These first of all wyll make vnto vs / quyetnesse of mynde of a dere price / as to be bought / with slug∣gardy
and slouthfulnesse / and as tho he were sicke / they warne euery man / as it were with this worde / lye still wretch in thy bed. Trewly where as it is an hurt∣full medicin to the body that deedly slug¦gardy / nerawhit better phisicien for the sickenesse and trouble of the mynde / is slouth and tendernesse / & faynt hert for∣saker of frendes / kyn / and countrey. Be∣sydes that it is false / that vnacyfe men lede a quiete lyfe / for els it must be that the lyfe of women were more quietous than that of men / as they that syt wat∣chyng at home / occupied ī huswifely oc∣cupatiōs. And yet whan somoch / as the north wynde can nat trouble the yonge maydens / as Hesiodus saith / the diseses of the mynde / the troubles / the passyon of an yll thought / by ielousy / su{per}sticion / ambicyon / and vayne glorie / wherof no man can attayne the nōbre / crepe neuer∣thelesse / in to the house of their occupa∣cion. Laertes lyueng twenty yeres ī the coūtrey (as it is said) only with an olde woman to serue hym of his meate and drinke / fled from his countrey and prin∣cely paleys / & had neuertheles sadnesse and frownyng debate in cōpany. what
if that same / nothyng to do / hath trou∣bled many from the ryght order of the mynde? as sayth Homere by Achylles / that he sat amonge the shippes folowīg his ire / with ferme purpose / flyeng from the fight / & the worthy counsayls of the nobles and the people / and dyuertīg the name of men vnactyfe / he fayleth in his hert / and agayne streyght he seketh the batails / and stereth him selfe ī the cruell stryffes of Mars. Therfore / whan he coude nat suffre hym selfe to wyther ī y∣delnesse / he sayth angerly / I sytte lyke a deed lumpe of erthe / as the keper of the shippes. Nor yet Epycure the alower of voluptousnesse / is nat their auctor / that are outher ambitious or desirous of glo¦ry by nature / that they shulde gyue thē to ydelnesse / but vnto the gouernaūce of cōmynaltees / as nature ledeth them. for men that are borne to busynesse / can nat suffre with euyn and vntroubled mynde to be deued / of that they most desyred: Altho lyke a fole / he calleth them to a cō¦mon welth / that can nat holde them self from it / and nat rather thē that ar mete for the rule of it. Nor trewly the suretie and trouble of the mynde / ought nat to
be measured / with multytude or scarsty of businesses. For to ouerslip honest thī¦ges / is no lesse displesaunt & troublous than (as we haue afore said) to do foule thynges. But thē also that haue chosen one maner of life to be voyd frō trouble / as some do the life of these husbādmen / some of syngle men / and some of kyng{is}. Menander warneth with these wordes / that they erre far (as they say) out of the way. I thynke o Phania that these rich men that nede nat to make eschange for gayne / nor to playne in the night / nor in turnyng them vp and downe / to say of∣ten alas / slepe the swete and soft slepes. but whan he came and {per}ceyued the rych men / as well as the nedy to be troubled / it is no marueyle / {quod} he / they ar of kyn & both borne at a burthen / lyfe & trouble. for it is the felowe of voluptuous lyfe / & of that brought vp by nede it encreseth. And trewly / as fearfull and sicke folke out of a lytell bote lepe in to a gret shyp and from thens agayne in to a galy / thī¦kyng euer to be better / tyll they {per}ceyue them selfe nothyng the nere / & (as who sayth) clene done / as they that cary the coler and fearfulnesse euerywhere with
them / so to take another & another kynd of lyfe / can nat delyuer the mynde from cōbre and troubles / such as ar vnknow∣lege of thynges / vnconsydred auenture / nouther to know nor to can vse a ryght thynges present / for a mater that is hap¦pened. These thynges trouble the riche aswell as the nedy / and vexeth with sad¦nesse the syngle men as well as the ma∣ryed. And for these causes / many that thinke moch welth is ī opyn places / can nat suffre a secrete restfull lyfe. for these selfe same causes / it repenteth many / of that they haue begon / that with gret la¦bour haue thrust thē self in to the cour∣tes of kynges. It is an vnplesaūt thing of sicke men / as Ion sayth / for the wyfe troubleth thē / they blame the phecisyen they be angry with the bed / ye and their frende noyeth them visytyng them / and agayne departyng displeaseth them. Af¦ter that whan the disese forsaketh them and that by returned tēpre helth cometh makyng althyng mery and plesaunt / so that he on the ton day that coud nat bro¦ke an egge nor fyne bred / on the next day eteth hūgerly whetī bred & cresses. such effect & strēgth is there in resonīg / for to
chaūge eche purpose of lyf / for the hap¦py passyng of the same. Alexāder whan he herde Anaxarchus argue that there were infynite worldes / it is said that he wept / and whan his frendes asked hym what thing had happened hī to be wept for. Is it nat to be wept for / {quod} he / syns they say there be infynte worldes / & we are nat yet lorde of one? Crates cōtrary¦wyse / wearyng an olde cloke lyned with sport and laughter / as in holydayes tyll his last. Agayne to Agamemno it was greuous that he ruled so many / whā he sayd / Thou shalt knowe Attrides Aga∣mēnon / whom aboue all men Iupiter ex¦erciseth and troubleth with labours. Diogines / whan he was on the stone to be solde / he scoffed wt the crier that shuld auaunce the sale / and whan he bad hym aryse / he wolde nat / sayeng at the laste / what if thou shuldest haue solde a fissh? And Sorates in his bond{is} dyd dispute of wisdome among his pursuers. Lo on the othersyde / Pheton clymyng in to he¦uin / optayning wepīgly / that his father shulde take hym his chare and his horse to rule. Trewly as a showe may be wre∣sted to the facion of a dyuers foote / but
nat the fote lykewise to the facion of the wrested show / So do the passions of the thought make eche maner of life that is offred thē conformable & like to thē self / nor vnto thē that haue chosē the best lyf custōe maketh it nat plesaūt / as sōe say / but rather wisdō maketh the best life to be also most plesāt. Therfore the well of surete of the mīde / sprīging ī our self / let vs assay to make most pure & clere / that those thing{is} that gyue vs foren thing{is} & chaūceable / we may make mete & accor∣dīg / in suffrīg with gret vprightnesse of the mynde. For trewly it accordeth nat to be wroth agayn thynges that chaūce amisse. for our angre nothyng {per}tayneth to them. but he that can amend by craft yll chaūces / he trely doth more lauda∣bly. Therfore Plato compareth mānes lyfe with the dyse / in the which the best cast is to be of the dyser desyred moost. but how soeuer it happen / there shuld be a ware hede / that he vse ryght that that the chaunce gyueth / wherof it is to par∣ceyue that the tone is nat in our power / that is the chaunce of the dyse / the other is / if we be wyse / that we take with euyn mīde / that that chaūce gyueth / & to gyue to eche of thē his place / that that which
chaūceth well / may be most profyte / and that lest hurt that happeth ouertwhart¦ly. But vnconnyng men / and ignoraunt howe to lede their lyfe lyke sickely men / that can nother suffre hte nor colde / as in {pro}speryte they are with an hye forhed outragious / kepyng no measure. so are they in aduersyte / with knyt & bent bro∣wes fouly distempred. So are they trou¦bled of both / or rather ī both / of thē self / and lykewise in those that are taken for good thyng{is}. Theodorus that was cal¦led Athens / was often wont to say / hat he reched wordes to his herers with his right hāde / & they toke them with their lyft hande. Foles oftentymes whan for¦tune offreth her ryght hande / vncomely turnyng them selfe / set her on their lyft hande. wyse men do better / that lyke as bees make hony a right swete thīg / out of drie tyme / an herbe of very byt tast / so of very vnhandsome thynges / oft ty∣mes they chuse out some handsome and prefytable thynges to thē. which thing wolde be moche thought on / & laboured with great exercyse of the mynde. For as he that cast a stone at a froward dog / whan he mist the dogge / and hit his step
mother vnware / It is nat moch amysse {quod} he. So may we mende and turne ano¦ther way fortune / whan she chaūceth o∣therwyse than we wolde. Diogynes by∣cause of his exyle / left his coūtre / it was nat so greatly yll / for it gaue hym occa∣syon of lernyng philosophy. Zenon of Citius that had but one shyp / whan he herd that it was perished / the maryners the marchandise / and (as they say) eue∣ry crom / Fortune / {quod} he / thou doest very wel with me / that driues me to myn old cloke / and to the porche of philosophy. what therfore shall let vs / that we may nat folowe them? Thou art fallen from some rule or authorite / thou shalt lyue ī the countre. Aplyeng thy priuate busy∣nesse / with great compasse assayeng to auaunce thy selfe in the princes fauour thou art refused / thou shalt lyue surely euery where / with no busynesse layd vn¦to the. Agayne thou art tāgled with ma¦ny cares and busynesses / warme water doth nat cheryssh so moch / tendre mem∣bres (as sayth Pyndarus) as honours and glory ioyned with power / doth ma∣ke labour swete / and suffrable. But som offēce dothe trouble the / of backbityng /
of enuy / or nouhhty sclaūdre / the best re∣medy is with the muses / or in som place of leruyng to suffre ouer / as it happened vnto Plato / as in a cruel tempest / whan he was taken ī to the fauour of Deny s Therfore it is of no lytell effecte / for the quietnesse of mynd / diligently to marke noble and famous men / if they haue suf¦fred any lyke thyng / by those same cau∣ses / as by example / want of children ma¦keth the sad / Loke on the Romayn kyn¦ges / of whom neuer a one dieng / left his reigne to his childe. Pouerte / thou can¦nat suffre wt euyn mynde / who than had¦dest thou leuer be of al the Boetians / ra¦ther than Epaminōdas / or of al the Ro¦mayns / than Fabricius? But sette case thy wyfe be nat chast / knowest thou nat thepygram of Agys in Delphos? Hast thou nat herde how Alcibyades defyled Time a his wife / and how she was wont to name the childe that she bare / priuely to her maydēs / Alcibiades? yet that let¦ted nat Agys / to be a very worthy and a noble man / no more thā vnchast dough∣ter of Stylphon dyd let hym to lyue the merylyst of all the philosophers of his tyme. whiche shame whan Wetrocles
layde vnto hym / is it my faut or my don his? {quod} he / thy doughts {quod} thother / but hy misfortune / howe can that be? {quod} he / are nat fautes fallynges? yes {quod} tother / and fallynges / are nat they also the er∣rours / of them that they are the fallyn∣ges of? trewe {quod} thother / and what be er¦rours? are they nat the mysfortunes of them / that they be errours of? with such a soft & resonīg pesable spech he taught the vayn checkis of the dogged man / to be but triflyng arking{is}. Lo now / there are many / whom nat onely the vyces of their frendes and kynsfolke / doth vexe / but in godd{is} name / they also of their en¦mys. for scoldyng / angre / enuy / folies / & combrous riualytees ar the foulyst spot¦tes of thē that they be in. yet they trou∣ble foles / like as the angre of neighbors or thiportunat famyliers / or the nough¦ty wyttes of seruaūtes / wherwithall I thynke thou be oftymes incued. And as it is in Sophocles / the phisiciens wassh away the bytter coler / with a bytter me∣dicyn / so thou (nat as aparteyneth the) agayn their diseses / and yll affectiōs of the mynde / art angry / and answerest thē with lyke sowernesse of the mynde / whi¦the
thynges that thou doest / a nat me∣ued with gode & thrifty maners / as most metest instrumētes / but for the most {quod}e with sharpe and frowarde condicions. & truly for to correct these thynges / whan it is more than thou canst do / o is it nat esy by any meanes. So that if thou cāst vse these thynges whan they growe / no nother wise than these surgiēs vse their sharpe scrapynge instrumentes / than if thou vse them thus / beryng alway with the / as case requireth / softnesse and me∣sure / truely thou shalt no more vexe thy self / with others wantones & foly / than thou shalt be gladded with the cōsciens of thyne owne affection. for thou shalte thīke they do it nat without a cause / no more than dogges whan they barke / do naughtly of their nature. or els folowīg such wekenesse and feblenesse of mynde / if thou care nat to be troubled wt others ylles / they shall disceyue the wrechedly / dayly suckyng vp many troubles / flow∣ing vnto the / as tho thou saest in a low bottome. what? many philosophers ha¦ue reproued pyte / with which we ar me∣ued in beholdyng mesurable men / thyn∣king that it is thooffice of a good man to
socour neyghbours / that be oppressed in misery / & nat to be sor therwith / or with slackesse of a low mynde / to gyue place to fortune. ye / and that that euery man wyll say is more / they wolde nat suffre vs / if we parceyue our self to haue done amysse / or to be of naughty mynd / ther∣fore to be troubled in our thought / & to be sory / for without sorinesse / such thyn¦ges shuld be mended / whiche whan it is thus / consyder well / how beestly it is to suffre our self to be any thyng wrath or angry / if they that we haue delt with all do nat gentylly & kyndly with vs. Tru∣ly I feare me my frende / leest the loue of our self disceyue vs / nor the frowardnes of yll speche vexeth so moch the mynde / as we prefer it ouer moche deseruyng of our selues / for vehemently / as it were wt dasyng / to be affectionate to certeyn thī∣ges / and vncomely to desyre and folowe them / or agayn to be agaynst them & ab¦horre them / no marueyle if these bringe stryues and offences among men / whan diuers men take it diuersly / outher these to be taken from them / or that they are fallen in to the other / but if any man / as chaunce requireth / vseth hym selfe with
measure to be aplyable / which way so e∣uer he turneth hym / he surely lerneth / wt handsome esynesse to haunt the cōpany of men. Nowe lette vs take our purpose that we left of the self thinges / lykewise as to them that ar sycke of agewes / all thynges tasted / semeth strait / bitter / and lothsome / tyll they haue sene other take the same thynges / without any token o vnplesaunt sauour / whiche they lothly haue cast vp / where at laste they ley the faut in themself & in the sickenesse / and nat in the mete or drinke. So we / if we consyder other that vse with great vp∣rightnesse of the mynde and mery chere / that that we passe nat without playnt∣full heuynesse / must nedes leaue to be so angre with the selfe thynges. But truly for to kepe constancy of mynde in aduer¦site / it is of great effect / nat to forgete wt a wynkyng eye (as they say) those thyn¦ges that sōtyme hath happened hapely vnto vs / as we wolde haue wysshed / and with due medlyng to way the {pro}sperous thynges / with euery yll chaunce. But where / as wear wont to turne our eyes / that be dased with beholding bright thī¦ges / vnto fresh and grene colours / for to
refressh them / contrary wyse / we tourne our mynde to heuy thyng{is} / and by force cōstrayne it to the remembraunce of thī¦ges most of repentaunce / and we pull it away agayn the wyll of it / from agrea∣ble and suffrable thinges. And here I re¦mēbre I may bring in metely / that that ones was spoken to a busy felowe / med∣lyng in that that partayned nothyng to hym / what the myschefe vngracious fe∣lowe / thou sest other mēnes vices with kytes eyes / & thyn own thou lett{is} passe / with wynkynge owles eyes? To what purpose good man doest thou cōsyder so diligently thy harmes / & renewes them alwayes with busy remembraunce (and hast no regarde to that welfulnesse that is present? And like as these surgen box¦inges suckes out of the flessh the worste blode / so doest thou / all the worst of thy thynges / gader in to thy selfe / ra whit better than Chius the marchaunt / that where he solde moch wyne of the best / he gadred to hym selfe / the sower and deed wyne. whose seruaunt whan he ran a∣way from hym / and one asked hym for what cause he forsoke his mayster / aun∣swered / for bycause whan he had good
thynges in his handes / he sought for il. Many lyke vnto hym forsakyng swete drinkes / gyue them self to sharpe & byt∣ter drīkes. So dyd nat Aristyppus lene vnto the heuy balaunce of harme / but re¦ched hym selfe to the lyghter. He whan he had lost a pleasaūt maner / asked of one of them that shewed them self most sory and āgry for his fortune. Knowest thou nat / {quod} he / that thou hast but one lytell house / and I haue yet thre good fermes left me? yes {quod} thother. Than shulde I / {quod} he / rather be sory for thy fortune? for it is lyke madnesse to be sory for thyng{is} lost / nat reioysīg in thīges that be safe. And as lytell chyldren / whā one hath ta¦ken from them one tryfle among many / castyng away al the rest / they wepe and crye. so lykewise we troubled by fortune in one thyng cōplayning and lamētyng make all other thynges to vs vnprofy∣table. But one wyll say / what haue we? ye / rather what haue we nat? He hath glorie / he a house / another a wyfe as he wolde wysshe / and he a faithfull frende. Antipater of Tarsis dyeng / whan he re¦kened on his fyngers / the thynges that he had had in his life / he forgate nat the
good se passage / that he had out Cilicia to Athens. & pardy / these cōmon & light thinges ar nat to be passed / and there is cōsyderacion to be had of them / that we lyue / that we are in helth / that we se the sonne / that we haue no warre nor rebel∣lyon / that the grounde is erable / & that the see may be sayled with litell labour. ye / and for the last / that we haue lyberte to speke and to holde our tong / to be bu∣sy & ydell. Truely the possession of these thynges / shall gyue vnto vs / a plentous mater of quietyng the mynde / if we fa∣sten in our mynde thimage of the absēce and of the desyres of them / therby war∣nyng our selfes (how helth is moch desy¦red of sicke men / peace of them that are combred with warre / how moch desyred vnto a streyer abrode / and vnto an vnno¦ble man is glory / and toptayne suche a name in such a cyte. agayne how disple∣saunt it is / to lese it whan thou hast it. And yet I thynke nat / that any of these thīges or like shuld be so gret / & to be de¦syred / that whan it is lost / nothīg shalbe safe. for it shuld be nowhit more estemed for that it leueth to be. Nor they shulde nat be possessed / as so worthy thynges /
nor kept with such busynesse / watching busely / leest we be spoyled of them as so precious thiges / that we shulde therfore set lyght / and nat regarde thynges that we haue safe / as tryfles. for these wolde be vsed / and the frute taken of thē with gladnesse / most for that cause / that whā chaunce happeneth / we may suffre more pesably and temperatly / the losse of thē. But trewly / as Archesilaus sayd / some thynke it a great thing / with diligent in tent of mynde and of eyes / to beholde o∣thers enditynges / pyctures and ymag{is} / exquisitely / as they come to their hādes and they nat regardyng their owne life / tho they that behold others chaunces / & loke vpon hym that hath many consyde¦rations & aduertysmentes / and they nat vnplesaūt / lyke these adultrers / that lo∣thyng their owne wyues / folowe other mennes / erre (as the prouerbe sayth) all the worlde out of the waye. For it ma∣keth moche towarde the constaunt state of the mynde. first to esteme hym selfe / & his own thinges / and the particulers of one / if nat / at the lest to tourne thyntent from consyderacion of courser thynges / at as the cōmon sort of menlin dyuers
maner to wonder on th / whom fortune hath exalted to the heyght of thynges / whan she lysted to sport. as by example / they that are in prison thinke bondmen happy that are losed / they them that be free / they that be free thynke them that haue the lawe of cyties in their handes happy / and they riche men / & riche folke prouostes & gouernours / and they kyn∣ges / and at the last kynges / the goddes / whom (I had nye said) it irketh also of their godheed / outcept they myght haue power of thunder and lightning / so that where they cā nat be euyn with their su¦periours / they can nat (as they say) rest with in their bondes. I care nat for the goodes of riche Gygis / {quod} Thasius / nor yet I wondre greatly at them / nor I en∣uy the marueylous workes of the god∣des / nor yet gape I gretly after any kīg¦dome / for fer fer are these thīges frō my eyes / said this Thasius. Lo now cōtra¦riwyse suche another as Chius / or ano∣ther Galates or Bithynus / nat content that he hath gotten glory & may stership among the cytezins / but on goddes na∣me he must aske pleyningly to be a sena¦tour / whan thou hast gyuen him that he
must be prouost / and sette case that thou graunt him that / than must he be cōsull and whan at last thou hast put to that / all is nat worth a pes / outcept he be {pro}∣nounced the first. And what other thing I pray the is this / but in gadrīg causes of vnkyndnesse agayne fortune / to tour∣ment hym self / and hym selfe {per}petually to punish him self? Truly a man well as¦sured of his mynde / tho one or other of mortall people (where as we ar sixe. C. tymes / hundred thousande seers of the son / and chyldren of the erth) passe hym in glory of name / or habundaunce of ry∣ches / sytteth nat abiect or lamentable wt wringyng handes (as they say) but ra∣ther where he seeth hym self better hād∣led / thā an infynite multitude of vndone men / as often as he cometh abrode / he re∣ioyseth in his fortune. In the assays of Olympias / there was no vyctour that might refuse to medle with who so euer came fyrst / hauynge no lyberte to chuse his matche. In our lyfe the state of thin¦ges gyueth lyberte to eche man / that cō¦pareth hym self & his fortune / with ma∣ny / & with the fortune of many / to haue an hye and an vpright mynde / & to make
hym therby to be seen and wōdred at to other / rather than him self to wonder at other / so that he be nat so folysshe to cō∣pare hym to Briarcus or to Hercules. So whan thou marueylinge / seest some great man caryed in a lytter / lette down thyn eyes / & loke vpon the berers ther∣of. Agayn whan thou shalt wonder on Xerxes / as very happy / whan he passed the strait{is} of Hellespont / with a brigge shapt of shyppe wood / behold also them / some their noses & some their eres smyt¦ten of and māgled / by reason of the brig broken / with shakyng of the furour of the sees rage / brekyng in by Athon / and beleue that they prayse with great com¦mendacion / the and thy fortune. Socra∣tes whan one of his frendes tolde hym / that all thyng was dere in the town / for wyne of Chia was at a pounde / and pur¦ple at thre pounde / and hony at .v. shyl∣lynges the gallon / toke him by the hāde and ledde him in to the meyle house / it is solde / {quod} he / for an halpeny the halfe bus¦shell / therfore vtell is good chepe. from thens he brought hī ī to the oyle house / it is solde / {quod} he / for two brasse pens two gallons / al thyng than is nat dere ī the
towne. So lykewise we / if we here any man say that our fortune is bare & wret¦ched / for that we haue nouther the con∣sulship nor other maistershippe / we may say vnto hym / that our fortune is fayre and goodly / and that we go nat frō dore to dore / and that among porters and be¦rers / we wery vs nat with burdens / nor like flatterers / are cōstrained to be as pa¦rasites to princes. Altho (for we ar now come to that madnesse / that eche of our lyues hangeth vpon other mens / more than our own / and that our nature is so altred / in to a certeyn vnkynde and enuy¦ous affectyon / nat so moch to glad ī our owne / as to be troubled with other fol∣kes welthes) if thou loke nat only vpon those wonders / and famous thynges in them / whom thou wenest very blessed / & (as they say) in Iouis lap / but the curtē & the fayr trauers drawen / lettyng passe their glory and vtter apparēce / if aswell thou loke with in them / thou shalt truly fynde many inward{is} / sower & troblous. Pyttacus / whom the sure fame noyseth to haue ben endewed with wysdome / for¦titude / and iustyce / whan he was cherīg¦gest{is} that he had / it is sayd his wyfe cāe
and angerly ouerthrew the table / wher∣with whan he sawe his gestes abasshed eche of you / {quod} he / is troubled with some yll / I am in this state alway very well. This man that was demed abrode to be very happy / whan so euer he entred his threshold / he semed to be a wretch / I say nat that he was one / where his wyf had all and ruled prīcely / where oftimes & al¦way he neded to fyght with her. Many thynges do trouble you / nohyng dothe trouble me. Many such lyke thinges do cleue vnto glory / vnto riches / ye and vn∣to a kyngdome. but truely of the igno∣rant multytude vn{per}ceyued / for the pōpe is drawen / behynde the which those thī¦ges lye hyddē. Happy Attrides glory of grekes / eueriwhere mylde fortune the fa¦uoureth / whyle she exalteth her chylde. This vtward blyssednesse to be compa∣sed with wepyns / horse / and armes / let vs here lykewise / the repentyng voice of an yll troubled mynde / cryeng agaynst suche excesse of glory. Mighty Iupiter hath tāgled me with greuous chaūces / & ī another place. O happy & blessed that ferre out of danger / vnnoble / and vnglo¦rious / haue assed their lyues. By these
and such lyke declaracions / it may be sē¦sably parceyned / the playntfull vnquiet¦nesse of the mīde / scoldyng with fortune and casting away it self with wodring at other / & to ryse for top sse it self / and the owne thynges. For of trouth it bre∣keth marueylously the constant & quyet state of the mynde / with hyer entent to stryue aboue the power to get any thing as to sayle with gretter sayles than pro¦porcion / as whan hope shyneth neuer so lytell / {pro}mysing folisshly vnto our selfes vnmesurable and great thynges / & than whan chaunce foloweth nat / we accuse wicked fortune and our desteny / whā ra¦ther we shulde dam our selfes of foly / as it were to be angry wt fortune / that thou cast nat shote an arowe with a plou / or hūt an hare with an oxe / and that some cruell god shulde be agaynst them / that with vayn indeuour / hunt an hart with a dragge net / and nat that they attempt to do those impossibilytes / by their own madnesse and folysshnesse. Surely the cause of this errour / is the noughti loue of our self. For men / ouermoch deseruīg of them self / where as with great stryfe they alowe them selfe best / enhaunced wt
pride / leaue nothyng vnassayd. For it is nat ynough vnto them to be ryche & elo∣quent / and amonge mery & gladsome fe∣stes. but that they must be famyliers of princes and in auctorite / but that they must haue the best horse & the best dogg{is} and (if god wyll) the best cockerels and quayles / or els they can nat be quiete in theie mynde. Denys thelder thought it nat ynough to be the grettest tyraunt in his tyme / but yuell content also / that he was nat so good as the poete Phyloxe∣nus in poetry / and as Plato in the cft of resonyng / meued with yre / him he put in to a dōgion / and thother he solde / and banysshed in to Aeginas. So did nat A∣lexandre / that where he was greatly me¦ued with Brison / with whom he stroe in swyftnesse of the chart / with delibera¦cion emed plesaunt / forberyng his own right. Therfore Homere spake it very well by Achylles / such a one as was nō among the grekes in batayle / and after he sayth / but there were other that were more eloquent. Megabysus of Pera on a tyme whan he came in to Appelles shop / he began to bable I wot nat what of the craft of payntyng. Appelles that
coude nat suffre his folyes / afore / {quod} he / that thou shewedest thy self wt thy wor∣des / I had a good opinyon in the / by rea¦son of thy golde & purple / auaūcyg thy silence / now the prētises and boyes that grinde me my colours / do mocke thy ba∣blynge. There is that thyke that the Stoyik philosophers do mocke vs / ī dis¦cribyng a wise man af their facion / nat only to be wise / iust / and strong / but also an oratour / an emperour / a poete / ye & a kyng. and they are nat ashamed to as∣cribe all these names vnto him / altho if they {per}ceyu them self in dispeyre of thē / they are alway il content / which how it accordeth with reason / they may se whā that they knowe the goddes contented / eche with his godheed to be satisfied / as to be called Enyalius / that hath aucto∣rite ouer the furour of bataylc / another Mantous / that is ouer {pro}phecies. ano∣her Cerdous / that is ruler of lucre. So that in Homere / Iupiter forbyddeth to Uenus werly maters / as nothyng {per}tey∣nyng to her / & byddeth her to take hede to mariage maters. Besydes this / som∣thynges of thē that seme to vs to be de∣syred / accorde nat togider of their owne
nature / as by example. He that desyres the study of sayeng & of lernyng / he must be quiete and without busynesse / agayn auctorites and familyarite with prīces ar wont to make busynesses / & to bring often cōbraunces. Plētous vse of wyne and flessh / maketh a man strong & migh¦ty / and the mynde frayler and weker. A∣gayn / vnmesurable diligence to encrese / or busy trouble for to kepe / agreeth for the gadring of riches. A tother syde / con¦tempt & dispisyng / is a great instrument for the beginnyng of philosophy / and al¦most the first and chefyst exercyse of it. So al thinges is nat for euery man / but he that wyll obey the poesy of Appollo / must first knowe him self / and so take ad¦uyse of his owne nature / & as she ledeth to take an order of lyfe / rather than pas∣syng from one to another / to force & con¦strayn his nature. An horse for the cart / an oxe is mete for the plowe / after a ship that sayleth / a dolphin is mete to swym / and to hunt the bore a cirse dogge. So that if one be troubled / for that a migh∣ty lyon may nat be norisshed ī a womās lappe / as well as a lytell whelpe / surely he is a gret fole. And he is neawhit wy¦ser /
that wyll write of the worlde & seke the nature of thynges / both after Empe¦doclis facion or Platos / or Democritus togider / or to lye with a riche old womā / as Euphorion / and to be lyke those that were wont to bāket late with Alexādre / as Medius / and thinke it vncomely and scant to be suffred / outcept he may by ri∣ches be as notable as Ismenia / & by ver¦tue / as noble as Epaminōda. Ronners whan they haue their game / are content that wrestlers haue their reward / if thou haue gotton / sayth Solon / the towne of Sparta / order it with lawes & decrees. we wyll nat chaūge wt you / saith the sāe man / vtue for riches / syns thone is our owne & stable / & riches is but chauncea∣ble / & passeth frō one to another. Stra∣to whan he herde that Menedemus had more scolers than he. Lo / {quod} he / is it nat to be marueyled / if many had rather be wasshed than perfumed? Aristotle wri∣tyng to Antipater / it is mete saith he / to be as glorious for Alexander / and to be consydred / nat onely to raigne ouer ma∣ny people / but also to haue beside other / a right opinyon of godly thing{is} / so that they that vnder this maner / calle their
glad thynges glorious / and nat so lytell to be estemed / they wt out doute shall nat be troubled / with wondring at straunge thynges. yet now whan none of vs sees a vyne beare fygges / nor an olyue beare grapes / we braule with our selfe neuer∣thelesse / and with vngentyll gredynesse oppresse our selfes / & are so wery of our selfes / outcept we may attayne to the hy¦est degre / both of richmen and of lerned men / both at home & in the wrres / both of philosophers and of warryers / ye and bothe of flaterers & of them that by tru∣sty and free playnesse / are knowen to be true / and at last / bothe of nygard{is} & wa∣sters. Altho that we se nature to tech vs marueylusly. For as it is sene by nature dyuers beestes to feed for their lyuēg dy¦uersly / nor that she wolde that all shuld be norisshed with sedes or with flesshe / or with rotes / but as they are dyuers to ete dyuers meates / so hath the same na∣ture gyuen to mankynde dyuers orders of lyueng / as pasturyng / plowyng / fou∣lyng / and fysshīg. we must therfore eche of vs chuse that / that we knowe is most metest for vs / and with all our endeuoir gyue vs to that / & to parte from the pos¦session
of that that we parceyue partey∣neth to another / or elles it is to no pur∣pose that Hesiodus sayd. The potter en¦uyeth the potter / and ouer the smythes craft his felowe is enuious. Truly now men are nat ledde with enuy of the craft or order of their felowes / but riche men with enuy of lerned men / nobles of riche men / men of lawe / of deceyuers / and of players and of tomblers / and at the last / free and noble men of auncient famyles dasyng for wonder at the good fortunes of men of bondage in the courtes of kyn¦ges / while they thīke that all their own fortunes are to be lothed / they trouble them self / & with no lytell cure of mynde kyll them selfe. Surely that euery man hath cofrs & receytes / and as who saith springes / of surety & trouble in his own thought / and Homers tonnes of good & yll / nat as he said ī Iouis dore / but with in his own mynde / the dyuersite of men proueth gretly / whom we se by affectiōs of the myde to be diuersly tempred. for foles let good thynges passe tho they be present / and regarde them nat whā they perisshe / so moche doth their thoughtes gape gredily after thynges to come. Cō¦trariwyse /
men of wyt with sharpe remē¦braunce / reducyng them self to thynges that be present / make those thīges that yet are nat / to be at hand. For that that is at hande and present / offring it self to be taken ī on onely instant / after that vn¦remembred / semeth vnto foles nother to be ours / nor to partein to vs. and as the roper that is paynted in Plutos house / as moche as he dyd wreth out of his bas¦ket in to his rope / he suffred folisshly an asse that stode by hym to ete / no nother∣wyse doth the vnkynde & slouthfull for∣gettinge of many / settyng asyde the cō∣modites of thīges past / the worthy do dedes / the noble actes / the plesant ydel∣nesse / the mery and gladsome cōpany / & forgettyng and scrapyng out all the de∣lyte of the lyfe / suffreth nat their lyfe to be all one facyoned and weued togyder  with the thinges past & the thynges pre¦sent / deuyding yesterdayes lif from that of to day / & that from that of to morow / althyng do they make vndo / with the weryng out of their remēbraunce. True¦ly they that ī the scoles of philosophers toke away encresynges of bodyes / as va¦nisshing substaūce by wast / they only in
their wordes made eche of vs / another & another than our selues. But they that contayn nat thynges passed / as tho me∣mory failed / nor again remēbreth them / they do nat now in wordes / but in very dede / make them selfe dayly more nedy & more voyde / gapyng alwayes on to mo∣rowe / as tho thinges of last yere / of late / & of yesterday / {per}teyned nothīg to thē / & as tho thei had neuer chaūced vnto thē. So that the constant state of the mynd / by this maner is troubled. And euyn as flyes slyp of whā they crepe vpon smoth glasses / & in rough & rugged places thei cleue esely / so men slyding frō gladsome and plesant thinges / holde fast the remē¦braūce of heuy thynges. And lyke as at Olinthus / ther is a place they say / wher in these horned flies be taken / and whan they be ī / they can nat get out again / but a great whyle flyeng vp and down with in / makyng many circles in vayne / they dye at last. so men enwrapped in the re∣membraūce of ylles / can neuer after get forth nor get socour. Therfore as payn∣ters are wont in tables to vnderlay dym colours to the eyes / and to enlyne and draw faire and bright colours vpon thē
so shulde men in their owne myndes / all heuy and darke chaūces / ouercouer and ouerthrowe with glorious & faire chaū¦ces / worthy to be remembred. for thīges past can nat clerely be fordone / nor be a∣gayne afterwarde / by man onely. For so variable / dyuers and reboūdable / is the tune of this worlde / as of an harpe / nor in mortall thynges / is there any thynge that is pure / clere / & symple. But as mu¦syke standeth by hye and lowe soundes / and grāmer by letters / vowels & mutes / and that he is nat a musycien or a gra∣marien / whom eitherlyke of these dothe offende / but he that can vse them & tem∣per thē most accordingly / no notherwise it semeth / that he wisely hath stablished his lyfe / that most dyuers chaunces con¦trary among thē self / hath lerned to mī∣gle hansomly / wayeng prosperite with aduersite. for clerely to set aparte / good or yll / mortall comodite wyll nat suffre / but it behoueth to make a temper with both / if we wyll determyn right of these thynges. It is nat therfore accordyng / in the tone of these to playne / & faynting in the mynde / to fall down as it were vn¦der to heuy a burden / but the power and
thīpression of euery worst chaūce / to re∣pulse with the remēbraūce of better thī¦ges / alwayes wrappīg vp discomodites in comodites / as it were in a napkyn / to make the tenour of the hole lyfe / made & gadered with prosperites & aduersytes / as a certayne accorde / tēpred with con∣nyng reason. And truly / nat as Menan∣der thought / a man hath as soone as he is borne / a good spirite / as begynner of his lyfe & techer of right lyueng / but ra∣ther as Empedocles thought / two spyri¦tes of diuers cōdition / to whō he giueth dyuers & many names dothe receyue vs assone as we cōe ī to the light / frō thens¦forth gyuen vnto thē / as it were almost by right of seruice. He said that our ge∣neration did receyue the seed{is} of al these affectiōs / & that therfore the draught of our lyfe was nat euyn and leuell / but ra¦ther brackish & sower / & therfore the wi∣se man shuld haue the best thīges in his desyre / & loke for the worst / & in the tēper of thē bothe vse of neither {per}te to moche. Nor yet shall he cōe plesantly to to mo∣rowe / as Epicurus saith / that wt gret de¦batyng douteth whyder he shall lyue to it / but riches / glory / power / & authorite /
gladeth & reioyseth such men most / that with cōtrary thīges a totherside / if case happē / can be as gode & as vpright. For truly vehemēt appetit of any thīg / hath alway fere his felow of lesīg it / that dul¦leth the gladnes / & maketh it more to be desyred / as whā flame is resisted wt gret wind. whō truly reson hath taught assu¦redly & vnferfully thus to say to fortun / if thou gyue it I shalbe rizt glad / if thou take it agayn / I shalbe indifferent. this mā that can thus vse hī self / wtout mar∣ueyle / must ned{is} vse thīges that happen plesantly / and nat be pulled from thens with feare of that losse rennynge in the thought. Anaxagoras whan he herde that his sonne was deed / I knewe {quod} he / whan I begote hī that he shuld dye / & I haue suffred ouer that awaytīg. this af¦fection of Anaxagoras / is asmoch to be folowed of vs / as wōdred at. Surely we may stay forthwt ech misfortun / I knew I had slypy riches / nat nayled with sixe peny nayl / as they say in my possession / and that I had them / but to vse thē. I knewe well inough that they that gaue me power / myght also take it from me. I knewe that my wyfe was wyse / but
that she was also a woman  and for the last I knew that my frende was a man / that is to say / a lyuely thyng redy of na∣ture to be depraued / as Plato oft sayde. Truely he that compareth thus the rea¦sōs of his affections / & byldeth him such rāpers of reason / if ought happen other wise than he wold / or ouerthwartly / yet is it nat to him sodayn / and where as he neuer admitteth those cōmen thīges I wolde neuer haue went it / I was ī grete hope / I neuer thought it wold be thus / there truely dothe he fordo the vneuyn∣nesse of a stertynge or glytteriug hert / & of one that was troubled and meued / he maketh forwith to him self / one pesable and constant. Carneades was wont to warne men most in prosperite of aduer∣site / for that euery sodain thīges nature is to be receyued all with grutchynge of the mynde / & as a maner meltyng. How great aparte is nowe Macedony / of the romayn Empyre? yet Perses whan he lost it / nat onely accused fortune wt foule complayntes / but semed also to dyuers / most infortunate & wretched of all men. Loke on tother syde / Emilius whan he had ouercom him / partyng from the coū¦trey /
gyueng place in the lordship of the see and of the lande to the right succes∣sour / was receyued with the garlandes / and reioysynges of all men / and in the sa¦crifice extolled vnto heuē with praises / and nat vndeserued / but most deserued. For he remembred hym self to haue got¦ten a chaunceable kyngdome / the to ther¦by vnwened and vnforthought chaunce was put frome the height of his kyng∣dome. Me thīketh Homer techeth with a proper example / how moch more hurt¦full those thynges are that stryke soden¦ly. Ulies at his returne home / wept at the sodeyne dethe of his dog / and nat to his wyfe that sat by him and wepte. for in cōmyng / consydringe the wepynge y∣mage of his wyfe / he had subdued the af¦fection that els now wolde haue broken out / and by former shittyng of the mīde / had reduced it in to his own power / and was troubled with the vnforethought deth of the dogge / for that in the sodeyn thinge he had no space / to let the power of his affection. to cōclude shortly / thyn¦ges that chaūce agaynst our myndes / ar scant & herdly suffred / partly by nature / and partly we se thei ar greuous / by cor¦rupt
custome and naughty opinion / and they be the most parte. it is of gret effect against thē / to haue at hāde this sentēce of Menāder. Thou hast suffred no gret grefe / onles thou make it so thy self / for what toucheth it the / if it nother streyne thy flessh / nor reche to thy soule / as by ex¦ample / thunnoblenesse of thy father / the adultry of thy moder / the dignite of the first place taken from the / the reward of thy victory bereft the / what {per}teyn these thynges to the? for truely tho these thī¦ges happen / it shuld nat let the in thy bo¦dy nor in thy mynd to be well / ye & right well. Agaīst these thing{is} that by nature doth sōthing offend / as siknesses / hurt{is} / & dethis of kinsfolke / this must be set. a∣las / wherfore alas? for we haue suffred nothīg / that {per}teyneth nat to man to suf¦fre. For there is no speche that soner re∣buketh thaffectionate {per}te of the mynde / whā it is drawen ouertwhartly with af¦fectiōs / & whan it snatcheth the byt of re¦son ī the teth / thā that that warneth vs of our comen & naturall necessites / vnto whiche necessite man is borue / & entan∣gled as the body groweth / whiche shall gyue vnto stryuing fortune / a knot / sure
of all other thinges / that ar most chefe & grettest. They say Demetrius whan he sacked the town of Megarēsis asked of Stylpo if any of his godes was taken frō him? to whom he answered. I sawe no body take away myn / for wher as for¦tune hath suffred / all her thīges to be ta¦ken frō her / yet haue we no such thīges ī vs / as nother the grek{is} cā do nor suffre. it is nat therfore mete so moch to forsak nature / as hauyng no strēgth nor suffe∣raūce / to matche fortunes violēce. wher as we knowe rightwell / that that / that ī man may be hurt with fortune / is but a lytell / and the worst parte of vs frayle & ouerthrowen with euery impression / by deynte tendernesse / and that we our self haue the power ouer the better partes / wherin be set those grettest & good thin∣ges / as in an vnslypper place / and where also true glory / leruīges / & studys {per}tay∣nīg to vtue haue their beīg / nother mor¦tall nor byreueable by no strēgth. thus I say / knowīg our selfes of vnuyncible mīde / for trustīg to our self{is} / it becometh vs to be assured agayn thīges to come / & to saye that to fortune / that Socrates faynīg did say by Auitus & Melitus his accusers / truly {quod} he / to the iug{is} Auytus
and Melitus may slee me / but to do me hurt or displeasure / they can nat. for tho fortune might ouerthrow hym with dy¦uers sicknesses / take frō him his riches or accuse hym to a tyrant / or to the peo∣ple / yet might she nat truely make hym yll / or faynt herted / or fearfull / or altred of his mynde / or els make hym malicy∣ous / but onely a good man / endued with manlynesse and corage of the mynde / & at a worde she might nat bereue him the right order of the mynde / whiche truely profiteth more to man / for the ledyng of the lyfe / than the craft of sayling / for to passe the sees. For the maryner be he ne¦uer so cōning / can nat by any meanes re¦dresse the fury of the water / nor repulse the assaut of the feirce wynde / no more than get a hauen where he wolde / whan so euer he wolde retourne from the see. No / nor this cometh nat to him by craft that whan he is taken with tempest / cō¦stantly and vnferfully to handle the ne∣cessite / herto it helph nat / that whilst he dispayreth nat / for place for his craft / ta¦kyng ī the sayle / driueth as he may with the tēpest / the coward now sitteth down with wrīging hādes from all this gee /
& whyle the mast is drowned with force of winde / he shaketh with trēbling fere. but in a wyse man / an ordred mīde with the body brīgeth faire wether / that is to say with contynence / and tempre of fode and labour / wipyng away the causes of sicknesse / and if there be any outwarde cause of trouble / in the whiche a mans mynde is ron / as ī the roky flates / with quicke pullynge vp the sayle yarde (as Asclepiades saith) it passeth ouer. And if so be it enrese and growe more than can be socourd or suffred by man / the ha¦uen is nat fer of / and there resteth to the to swym out of the body / as out of the ship boote / whan it wyll holde no more. Truly foles / nat so moche for the desyre of lyfe / as for the feare of dethe / hangīg on the body cleue fast with claspyng hā¦des / no notherwise than Ulixes dyd hāg on the wylde figge tree / whan he feared the russhing of the horelpole Caribdis / whom Homer saith / was so nere taken in the see of Sycill / that he coud nother stoppe by reason of the wynde that sho∣ued hym / nor yet get out / so dyd that let him / and as tho he held the wolfe by the eres / as the prouerbe saith / coud nother
hold the ire / for werynesse & discomodite of the chaūce / nor let it go for fere of the dredfull pyll. But if any māneuer so ly∣tell cōsyder / the nature of our soule / and doth recken with hym selfe / the passage from the state of this lyfe to be to a bet∣ter / or at the lest to no worse / by deth tru¦ly he hath alredy / no lytell forderaunce for his iourney / that is to saye / the con∣tempt of deth. For who that / what with valyaunt vertue / whiche is the properte and peculyarite of man / and what with ordrīg assuredly the mynde / agaynst for rayne and straunge thinges / whiche cōe besyde nature / mightely to ouerthrowe our proper thynges / may lyue so plesāt∣ly / that he may say / I may go / I may go my way surely at the first tym / with the good leue of god / whan I wyll / whan I pray the / other greuous or cōbrous / or troublous thyng can happen vnto him? Of trouth / what soeuer he is that saith this worde / I haue preuented the / o for∣tune / and all thy entres were they neuer so streyte I haue stopte / this man nat wt berres / nor nayles / nor byldinges hath coraged and strēgthed hym selfe / but ra¦ther with decrees of philosophy / and ru¦les
of wisemen / whiche also be open & so redy for euery mā / that they nede but on¦ly the takynge. Nor we may nat take a∣way byleue in those thynges / that haue ben left to our remembraunce of our el∣ders / nor dispeyre in nothyng of thē / as tho thei were nat possible to be folowd / but as it is mete to loke vpon them / and to marueyle moche of them / as it were by grace wondringe of them / so must we make our selfes / by confyrmynge vs to their folowing lyklihodes of them / that by beginnynges set in small thynges / as sayeng gretter and gretter / we may pro∣fite to the hyest. But we must diligently loke / that we put nat the thoughtes of these thinges out of our mynd / nor that we let to tourne oft these thinges in our thought / and (as they say) to thinke on them with all our hert. Nor this busy∣nesse endeth no gret labour (for as a cer¦teyn swetnesse of the mynde / noyeth vs and hath taught vs with slouthful and vnexercised tendernesse / and hauntynge most prone thynges of lest busynesse / by an naughty fauour hath taught it selfe / out of vndelightsome thynges / to turne it selfe to eche plesant thyng / so lykwise
if any man vse to fayne in his mynd / the ymages of sicknesse / of labour / of exyle / & to gader vnto him the strēgthes of his reason / to discus diligently eche by hym selfe. this man / this / sall without fayle se that those thynges / for the most part / ar vayn and dispiable / that seme heuy / ferefull / and horrible / and to say trouth / threten more with their loke / than they do in the departyng But many abhorre that worde of Menander / that any man a lyue may nat glorie / in ayeng / this I wyll nat suffre. for that they knowe nat what it aueyleth for to auoyde heuines / to thynke and to vse to beholde fortune / with vnagreable and firs eyes / and nat to lee to tendre thoughtes / and trifling delytes / and norisshmentes of esy lyfe / ry¦syng at euery lytell hope / and fallyng at euery lytell thyng. Altho it may be thus answered to Menander. It can no wyse¦e sayde / whye I lyue this I wyll nat suffre / lette it be so / but this I may saye whyle I lyue / this I wyll nat do / I wyl nat lye / I wyll vse no crafty deceites for to compasse men / I wyll nat begyle / I wyll nat disceitfully lye in an ayte. this syns it is in vs / it is a great helpe to thē
that lyfte them selfe vp to the surety of mynde / in which maner lyke as botches be in the body / so is a naughty consciēce in the soule / as that that leueth repen∣taunce / busely prickyng and pulling the mīde. For where all other heuinesses ar wont to be taken away by reason / onely this repentaunce it selfe prouoketh by shame / as one that byteh and gnaweth hym self. And truely / as they that shake of a cold ague / or burne of an hote ague / ar more sharply and feruently vexed thā they that suffre the same thynges / of vt∣warde colde or hete. so casuall and chaū¦ceable thynges / haue more blunter heuy¦nesses / as outwarde and forayn thīges. And this thing / no body is to blame for me but my self / which is wont to be plai¦nynly cried / whan an offence is done / ma¦keth the hurt tha  greuous of it selfe / more greuous / and driueth it in de{per}. So nouther gorgiousnesse of buylding / nor weight of golde / nor noblenesse of kyn / nor greatnesse of empire / nor eloquēce & fayre spekyng / brinketh so moche clere∣nesse of lyfe / and so plesant quietnes / as bringeth a mynde discouered from trou∣ble of busynesse / lyueng (as they say) wt
hym selfe ferre from yll aduyse. whiche hauyng the well of lyfe (I mean yt & condicions / from whiche cōmendable de¦des do sprīg) clere and vntroubled / shall bring forth all his ded{is} / mery & vpright as it were with an heuenly grace / by the remembraūce wherof / he is feed with a more certeyn / than Pyndarus hope / no∣rishmēt (as he sayth) of old age. And as Carneades was wont to say / the swete fyrres tho they be cutte or pulled vp by the rotes / they kepe a swete sauour a lō¦ge whyle / truely in the mynde of a wyse man / honest dedes do euer leue a certeyn fresshe and plesaunt remēbraunce. with the whiche remembraunce that same in¦warde gladnesse springeth by a cōtynu¦all ryuer / as who saithe bering frute / to the great shame of their errour / that so lamētably blame this lyfe / sayeng it is a cōgregation of ylles / and a certeyn re∣sort of outlawes / in to the whiche onely the soules that be banyshed from aboue be put. I reken that worde of Diogines worthy remembraunce / whiche he sayd / whan he sawe a straūger in Lacedemo∣na / curiously pyking hym selfe agayn a holyday. what {quod} he / is nat euery day ho¦lyday
with a good man? yes and if we be wyse most gladsom holiday. For this worlde is a certeyne most holy temple / & most mete for god / in to this temple man is admytted whan he is borne / nat to be holde karuyn ymages wantyng senses / but the son / the mone / & the sterres / from whiche cometh mouyng / & the first prin¦ciples of lyfe / whiche prouidēce hath gy¦uen vnto vs to beholde / that they shulde be sensyble ymages and folowynges of intelligible thynges / as Plato saith. be sydes these / the flodes that bring forthe alwayes newe waters / and the erth pro∣ducyng fode / bothe vnto trees & vnto all kynde of bestes. with this goodlynesse & prospecte begynnyng truely our lyfe / it must be full of surety and of ouerspred gladsōnesse / nor  ar nat to be loked for of vs / Saturn festes / or Bacchus festes / or Myneruas festes / as many do that receyue these and such other festes with great awaytīge / gladsomnesse and sporte / in whiche they may more lyberal¦ly / glad them self with bought laughter gyueng wages vnto mynstrels and tom¦blers for their minde sake. And what is more vncomly / than that in suche plays
we syt with suche pertynax sylence do∣yn nothing els (as they say) (for there is no mā that lamēteth or wepeth / whā he seith Pythia begyn / no more than he is hūgry after the feest) and those good¦lynesses wherof god hym selfe is auctor vnto vs / and in maner player / with lamē¦tyng and sowernesse of mynde / ledyng a dolorous lyfe / we defile and make soro¦full. And yet most vnsely is this / whan we delyte in orgaynes played and soun∣ded / and in lytell byrdes songes / and be∣holde gladly the beest{is} playng and daū∣syng / and agayne ar offended with their frowarde noyse and their cruell lokes / yet neuerthelesse seyng our owne lyues sadde and heuy / frownyng / & ouerthro∣wen with most troublous affectiōs and tangled busynesse nd cures / and dri∣uen with vntempeesse / that nat on∣ly we can nat gette vs some lyberte and space to take our brethe / but nother here also other exhortyng vs to it. To whose warnynges with clere and opyn cares / if we wolde gyue hede / we shulde vse thī¦ges present as they come without any blame / and shulde rest with the plesaunt remembraunce of thynges past / and at
the last we shulde drawe towarde thyn∣ges to come / vnferefully and assu¦redly / with sure and glad some shyning hope. Thende. ¶ Imprinted at London in Fletestrete by Richarde Pynson / printer to the kynges moo noble grace. ¶ Cum priuilegio.
