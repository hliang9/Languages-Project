THE BISHOPS Last Vote in PARLIAMENT. OR, Their Supersedeas from both Houses, in February, 1641. Who are now wished to attend their Flocke, seeing they have time and leasure. Or if they will to preach in the Tower. Tempora Mutantur. Lodon, Printed for Iohn Thomas, 1641.
Good Night to the Lord Bishops. WHat gone my Lords, clean outed, hath an exit now at last passed upon the Myter, though with much adoe: Why God be thanked for it, and ne∣ver send us worser newes, Now you are eased of your Lordships, wee hope that you will be better acquainted with the familiar and Christian terme of brother, and seeing yee are dismissed of Temporall, (knowing that you hold it not onely a great shame, but a great sinne to be idle) we trust to find you more frequent in your spirituall charge and Pastorall employment, the execution whereof would be questionlesse more consonant to reason, more agreeable to the minds of all good men, and more acceptable to your Master that should be, (and as I hope for hereaf∣ter you will better take him to be) Iesus Christ. Who for his part we all know never gave order, never allowed greatnesse in his, save such as pro∣ceedeth from contemptaion and annihilation of a mans owne selfe, which indeed is the onely great∣nesse greatly, yea; onely respected of him, and which if he sees not in his immediate servants, (viz.) his Ministers, they shall be very small with
him how great soever they may be either in their owne dazling eyes, or in these of worldly men: Good (Mr. Bishops, for my Lord is gone now) let me be bold to tell you that which I suppose some of you know already (though for all I dare not undertake their Bishopricks farre in re∣venue surpassing, their knowledge in actu, did you ever observe that creatures living in two Elements, were never beloved, but ever hanted & pursued by either the Beast or Fowle, solely ap∣propiated vnto one or the other Element nature loues no division in place, not the God of Na∣ture in employments, are not the Otter, the Bea∣ver the soe eshewed, hated, shunned, and fled from by all Fish and Fire of the Sea, are they not sought or watched for, and laide in wait for, by all creatures on land, Dread they not these, feare they not those, are they in peace in the Water; are they quiet on Shore, nor flocke they nor sort they together in flockes, or companies as all o∣ther creatures that onely challenge unto them∣selves one Element or continuall reside and stay, neither are they not termed Animalia Soliuaga, creatures wandring alone, and that may bid a pox of their Companie? Marry are they, what may the reason of this be, it is apparent, divided in na∣ture, divided in disposition out of a covetous de∣sire to share in commons with all other setled & determinate creatures in respect of Station, they utterly loose them in love and affection, would it had not been your fortune or rather faults, that the world had not had so just an occasion and
ground to note you, like to the fore-named beasts in the quality of your Function, for then sure∣ly it would never have proved to you, as all other creatures did to them in them, in the matter of disaffection, nothing about you that you wore for matter of habit, nothing that you taught for matter of habit, nothing that you taught for mat∣ter of beliefe or Doctrine, nothing that you did for matter of employment and action, none to whom you did belong in matter of service & du∣ty, but savoured, yea stunke of an Otter, Beaver, or Soyle, viz. of a strange sundred Hocus Pecus, Hodge Podge, incongruus ridictionus, monstrous ex∣orbitancie, and now let us first by leave examine your Lincie Wolsey habit; that is Mag-pie like white and blacke, making shew of more clean∣nesse without then ever by good action could ap∣peare of innocency within, next a cap God blesse upon your heads, and that must have as many cor∣ners as a Cushion, or else the fats in the fire, for each corner forsooth points at a Cardinals vertue, doubt it not, as certainely as the Sea-mans Card doth at the foure Cardinall Winds, though upon triall made, your pericranium will be found as guiltlesse of their knowledge, as your lives and doings are of the practice (except I crie you mercie good gaffer Bishops) your Cap-cor∣ners may poynt at the foure Cardinall Vertues of Rome, there perhaps he poynts right, for some of you within these late dayes have beene sound as well proceeded in the Cardinall Vertue of Pride, in the Cardinall Vertue of Coveteousnes,
and in the cardinall Vertue of detestable Sloth and Idlenes, (to say nothing of the cardinall Vertue of Superstition, because if I should name more cardinall Vertues then the cap hath cor∣ners) I say with these cardinall vertues you are as ably endowed, as any cardiuall in the conclave at Rome whatsoever, now for your Doctrine, if that was not composed of two Elements let the world judge, for what was the scope of your discourse whensoever you were pleased to stand halfe an houre in the Pulpit, but this that a man might live as safe in the Water as on shore, in the pud∣dles of the Roman Superstition, as on the firme ground of Gods Gospell, you were luke-warme forsooth, betweene the cold Papist, and the hot Zealous Protestant (who you in your temporizing temperate discretion are pleased to call Puritane) and are therefore vomited out of the mouth of Christ, and out of the respect of all good men; your imployment was part for Heaven, and your Master, Christ, when you had nothing else to doe, partly for Earth and your Master the King, whome I must needs say you served a great deale better then Christ, for truly to give you your due you plyed his service, but some thinke your owne under his Skirts, both in the Starre-Chamber, and the High-Commission excee∣ding well, but it was both with reservation and expectation that the King should ply you with fat Benefices, great Bishopricks, high Honours, for no man must conceive that you must plie for nothing, you plide the King in what you thought
fitting, the King must comply with you forsooth in what you please, but now the World is come about, it is day all abroade although it is night with you, there be some others (of whom you lit∣tle dreamt some two or three yeares agoe) that have plide you now (somewhat to your easel must confesse, though not to your content) and as they have plide and served your pompous Titles and Temporall Votes in Parliament, with Courts and Iurisdictions with a Writ of Ease, for wee trust they will distribute your inclosed ast meanes and unmeasurable Revenues with a Writ of con∣scionable division; for to come to the matter, if you are so well skill'd in the Scripture, as both your age and place requires, how dare you gape after earthly Titles, when Christ your master (whome now I hope you will heare seeing you can better tend it) commands you plainly, bee yea not called Lords? and tell his Disciples (whose successours you would faine be in Dignity, but not in paines) that though it was so among the Heathen yet it should not bee so with them, you must needs equall Potentates and Kings, you are personae mixta, you are, no no the Parliament hath contriued you out of that opinion now, you were, and you had somewhat to doe about Hea∣ven, and more upon Earth (divisum Officium) but fee the Power and efficacie of a Parliament, they have made you all to mind Heavenly things, yea although it be against your will, to be short good Bishops, mind that calling for which all good men will mind you, thinke no more of ser∣ving
two masters, least you be beloved of neither, hunt no more after earthly imployments and preferments, least at length you have no place neither in one nor other, follow my councell, in so doing you may in time gaine something that you have lost, but be that cannot be content to come out of the Tower and preach as his Bre∣theren doe, let him for my part stay there still, or if hee will needs have the Title of Lord, let him quit the Kingdome and trudge Tiber, if he will to Tiburne, no question wee shall soone have an onester man in his place who will be content with such dignity, as it hath pleased Christ to give him. FINIS.
