THe Loue in her Seruice / is an Origi∣nall or Begining of all good and vp∣right Lyfe.

Ther shall noman likewyse remayne stand∣ing in thesame Iudgment / that resisteth the Loue, and dispeth her Seruice. For the Esa. 40. a. 60.62. a.

A groundly Instruction, wherin the Difference betwixt God / the Fa∣ther, and his Sonne / the Lorde Iesus Christ, is declared / according to the spirituall and heauenly Vn∣derstanding. Holy Father, this is the euerlasting Lyfe: That they knowe Thee / that thou only art very true God, and Him whom thou hast sent / Iesus Christ. Iohn. 17. Ther was demaunded by a Louer of the Trueth, and an Instruction desyered / touching the Difference betwixt God / the Father, and his Sonne / the Lorde Iesus Christ. And ther-vppon is answered
by HN / in wryting {reversed ;}according to the Declaring of the spirituall and heauenly Trueth; this Instruction heeraftter fol∣lowing. The First Chapter. I Haue thus-long deferred forto answer thee thy Demaunde in wryting {reversed ;}which thou Be∣loued Brother desyredst of mee / when I was last with thee; because of certen Matters that were needfull for me first-of-al to further. Wher-through I {reversed ;}by that occasion; haue not {reversed ;}hetherto; had conuenient tyme to ac∣complish thesame. 2. But I haue not for-al-that / forgotten thy Demaunde, nor through Slothfulnes / neglected to wryte vnto thee: neither do I de∣syre in any-wyse / to deny thee thy Request: but am alwayes wel-willing to witnes thesame vnto thee {reversed ;}according to that Vnderstanding which the Lorde giueth vnto mee; so much as it is profitable for thee to Edification. Not∣withstanding, I am burdened in my Heart / because I haue promysed {reversed ;}vppon thy De∣maunde; to wryte thee an Answere. 3. But not that the Grounde of the Matter
{reversed ;}about the which thou hast questyoned with mee· and desyred of mee / to answer thesame in wryting; is so hard or profound-of-vnderstand∣ing / to answere. O No: but because that the Vnderstanding of thesame Mynde / is so vt∣terly vnknowe Math. 11. c 13. b Iohn. 14. b. Ephe. 3. a. before all Sence of the Flesh. 4. Yea, how naked and bare soeuer the Scrip∣ture sheweth it / according to the Mynde of the Spirit / yet can it not for-al-that / be vnder∣stood 1. Cor. 2. b. nor conceaued by Flesh and Blood / Vn∣les the Man must first {reversed ;}according to the Coun∣sayle of the Scripture; be turned into another Mynde. 5. SEing now that the Scripture of the  Apostles of Christ / is spirituall, Iohn. 5. . 6. g. and witnesseth of Spirit and Lyfe: and that the Man {reversed ;}which readeth ye Testymonyes ther∣of / in the Letter; standeth captiued with a Fleshly Mynde / vnder Rom. 7. . the Sinne and his owne Good-thinking: and so taketh vppon Him {reversed ;}out of thesame Mynde of the Flesh and his owne Good-thinking; to vnderstande the Mynde of God out of the Letter / 1. Cor. 2. b. So can He not doutles bring it to-pas. For his Fleshly Sences and good-thinking Thoughts / do surely stretch no farder / but likewyse to such an Intelligence or Knowledg of the Fleshly Vn∣derstanding. 6. For-that-cause also / the Mynde of Man doth not {reversed ;}out of the Letter of the Scripture; vnderstand nor comprehende the Mynde of God / rightly: By-meanes-wherof / ther is
likewyse now at this present daye (like as cam-to-pas also in tymes-past / among Ier. 26. b. 28. a. b. 29. c. d. Math. 12. c. 23. b. c. d. 26.27. the world∣ly Wyse and Scriptur-learnedones) much Contention, Variance, and Controuersie / founde among the Children of Men / who do contende about Thatt which they themselues vnderstād not: and wil seeme to knowe Thatt / which according to the Mynde of their Vnder∣standing {reversed ;}wherin they are comprehended; is not to be knowen nor Vnderstood. 7. THe whilst now that the ritch bountifull God {reversed ;}out of the Loue of his Grace / vndeserued; giueth vnto Vs {reversed ;}in 1. Cor. 2. b. our inward Mynde; another Spirit for to discerne and to vnderstand with-al / 1 Cor. 1.2. b which is nor of Flesh and Blood. nor-yet mynded according to the earthly and fleshly Wisdom of this Worlde, nor according to ye Prudence of ye Ingeniousnes of ye worldly Wyse and of the cōtentions Scrip∣tur-learned or those of famous Schooles / Therfore do we perceaue / that it is perill∣ous to wryt-ouer vnto any man / of the Se∣cretnes of God Ephe. 3. a. and Christ: And that ther∣fore / we do dayly beare a Care or a Suspicion / whether Those that aske after the Vnderstand∣ing of the godly Trueth / do not desyre to knowe thesame Act. 17. c. out of Curyousnes or Sensualitee, or Iohn. 8. b. to iudg it according to their Good-thinking. 8. Therfore it is daungerous in this perillous Tyme / to discouer or to wryt-ouer the ground∣ly Depthes Rom. 11. d. of the godly Wisdom / vnto any∣man / because that we do now fynde many
Men that do aske / to thend to knowe much / Yea they seeke many Knowledges / wherby to vnderstand, and to iudg the godly Things / out of their Sharpwitednes or Industry. And thatt lyketh all those well / which haue no Lust to doo the Lordes Will. For therin lyeth the olde Roote Gen. 3. b. Rom 5. b. of Adam, wherout the disobe∣dient Knowledg springeth or cometh-foorth. 9. But to Iohn. 8 c. submitt themselues obediently to the Requyring of the gracious Woord of the godly Wisdom· and to the right Seruice of the Loue of Iesu Christ / also to cleaue vnto ye liueing God / in his godly Nature or Beeing / Exo. 20. . Deut. 5. a. and to serue, to prayse, and to honour Him / as He is a God / in his Christ / thatt lyketh fewe or none. Yet is thesame the newe Fruit of the Planting of Iesu Christ, wher-vnto the Scripture poynteth vs / which neither the Math. 11. c. Iohn. 14 c. 1. Cor 1.2. b Worlde nor her Wyse or Scriptur-learnedones do vnderstand, nor-yet conceaue the Mynde. For they knowe not thesame. 10. ALthough I do thus rehearse these  things / my Beloued: and that my Carefulnes standeth to such a Suspicion tow∣ards Many / Yet do I notwithstanding hope and trust somwhat better of thee / as that thou art more inclyned to vnderstand the Will and Mynde of God / to the intent to 1. Pet. 5. a. submitt thy∣self obediently ther-vnto / to thy Saluation, and to the Ephe. 1. b. Laude and Prayse of the godly Glory: and so to beleeue the liueing God and his Christ· to inclyne vnto Him· and to be∣com
2. Pet. 1. a. partaker of his Beeing / then for to knowe much therof / according to the Pleasure of thyne Owne-mynde. 11. Therfore also I wil not think it tedious vnto me to answer thy Demaunde / with Dil∣ligence / out of feruent Loue / If haply God would vouchsafe {reversed ;}through my small Seruice; to open EPhe. 1. c. thyne Vnderstanding, and {reversed ;}through his Increase or Blessing; to endow thee in thy Spirit / with his Grace, and to stirr-vp thy Heart to a pure Mynde towards God, and towards his Loue in Iesu Christ. The II. Chap. THus was then thy saying vnto me {reversed ;}as I remember; that the Woord which ye Apostles of Christ do wryte / was darke or incomprehensible for thee to vnderstande. namely, Rom. 1. a. 1 Cor. 1. a. 2. Cor. 1. a. Gal. 1. Ephe. 1. God our Father, and the Lorde Iesu Christ. And that in certen Places / Christ {reversed ;}in steed of the Sonne; is also vttered-forth for a Father and God. 2. Forasmuch as thy Vnderstanding suppos∣ed that ther-was nomore but Deut. 32. d. Esa. 44. a. 4 b. 46. b. 1. Cor. 8. a. One God (as it is also true) therfore was thy Demaunde thus vnto mee / wherof thou requyredst an An∣swer in Wryting: Seing now that ther-is no∣more but One God / wherfore is He then pro∣nouced-forth in two-maner of States? The which seemeth {reversed ;}according to the sounde of the
Scripture; as though the Apostles published Two Gods. 3. Veryly, the Difference of this Matter {reversed ;}wherof thou desyerest the Instruction; could not likewyse Iohn. 6. d. c. 7. c. 8. b. c. certen Iewes in tymes-past con∣ceaue according to their Vnderstanding out of the Flesh / Yea, thesame is yet also rightly vn∣derstood of Feawe. Yet do many perswade them selues notwithstanding {reversed ;}because that they in historical-maner / are mynded after the New-testament; that they haue thorowly-well conceaued the Vnderstanding of this Mat∣tier: and do for-that-cause perswade them∣selues / that they do farr exceede and excell the Iewes: supposeing that they haue the Fayth and the Saluation. and that the Iewes re∣mayne by the Workes of the Lawe. Now this passed-ouer, we wil proceede to further the Intent of our Matter. 4. VEryly, as we haue spoken before / of God / the Father / and the Lorde / Ie∣su  Christ, these are hard things before the Man / for to search-out the Vnderstanding of them / in his Knowledg, if he do not knowe God and Christ and the true Righteousnes of the godly Beeing / in Himself / but imagineth of God and Christ / without Him / and so goeth-on according to his owne Good-think∣ing / without the Administration of the true Light and his Loue. Yea, it is Math. 11. c. 13 b. 19. c. Iohn. 14. . vnpossible {reversed ;}after that maner; to vnderstand the right Mynde cleerly. And although likewyse / He
woulde search-out all the Knowledg of the Worlde, yet is it all in vayne / for to vnder∣stande thesame. 5. Although the Man shoulde imagine of the∣same Mynde / in the deepest-grounde of his Reason, yet can he not doutles {reversed ;}with any-man∣er of Prudence of the Flesh; conceaue that Vn∣derstanding. For it is an Vnderstanding / Esa. 57.66. b Sap 1 a. Math. 11. d. that ryseth not vpp in the Knowledg· but to the Lowely and Poore of Spirit▪ namely, in the Beleefe of the holy and gracious Woord / vn∣der the Obedience of the Loue. 6. For God / the Father, the Lorde / Iesus Christ, nor-yet the true Light of the godly Wysdom / shall Sap. 1. a. . Cor. 2. b. not be knowen / out of the Blood or Will of Man, nor out of any deepe Searching with the Knowledg. For God is a Iohn. 4 c. Spirit, a verytrue Light, Iohn. 1. a. 8. b. 9. a. 11. c. 12. c. 14. a. and an euerlast∣ing Lyfe: which God also / is not knowen▪ seene, nor vnderstood / but in his owne Spi∣rit, and in his true Light and godly Beeing. 7. SEing then that the only God / is 1. Iohn. 1. a. a verytrue Light / that no Darknesses do knowe nor beholde: and is not to be know∣en nor behealde / but in his Psal. 36. Light / ther∣fore is not Hee knowen likewyse / but by Those that do Heare and beleeue his gracious Woord, and that submitt them obediently Iohn . d. vn∣der the Requyring of thesame Woord and Will: and so do carry the Image 1. Cor. 15. c Ephe. 4. c. of his godly Bee∣ing, or do beholde thesame 2. Pet. 1. c. in their Spirit / as a Pattern of God, and hope theron / through
Fayth. And the Spirit of thosesame obedient Humbleones / is the Spirit that giueth respect to the seruiceable Testimonyes of the holy Spi∣rit of Loue / to thend to be Ioh. 15.17  Ephe. 3. c. incorporated to the lyke Beeing of God [namely, the Brightnes of the Cleernes of the godly Beeing / the vp∣right Righteousnes Ephe. 4. c. and Holynes that God esteemeth]. and then to knowe God the Father and his Sonne Iesu Christ / rightly and ac∣cording to the Trueth / and to vnderstand the Iohn. 17. a. Math. 13. b. Secretnes of the Kingdom of God and Christ. 8. But seing now that the Man is gon-back  or falne-away Gen. 3. a. Deut. 32. c. from his God, and from this pure Beawty and Cleernes of the godly Bee∣ing· and Rom. 1. c. Ephe 4. b. estrainged from the Vnderstanding of the Wysdom of Iesu Christ / therfore is he also becom disinherited of this Cleernes or Brightnes of the godly Light / and hath nei∣ther knowen the Father nor his Sonne ؛the Lorde Iesus Christ{punctel}. By meanes of which E∣straingin / He hath not borne or carryed in his Spirit / 1. Cor. 15. g.

WHen the almighty God {reversed ;}who is full of Wisdom and Righteousnes; had finished Gen. 1. a Heauen and Earth, and all their Gar∣nishing / then did He also create Him a Man / Gen. 1. c. 2. a.

Heer-through was God in the Begining {reversed ;}as a Light of Lyfe; of one-substance with the manly Creatures. And out of his like Beeing in the manly Creatures / God Gen. 2. c. brought-forth the Memory, for a good and holy Vnderstand∣ing / Because that his lyke Beeing shoulde not be alone in the manly Creatures. but that the Memory shoulde {reversed ;}in all good and holy Vnder∣standing; be an Helpe Glas. 1▪ or Ayde to the like Bee∣ing of the Godhead in the manly Creatures / to all Peace and Concord, and to all Loue and Welfare vppon Earth. 4.

Which Memory / in thosame manly Creatures [namely, being in their right Estate] is likewyse a Light / of the true Light, and a Lyfe / of the true Lyfe: and that altogether / to Peace and Righteous∣nes vppon Earth. 5. This / in the foremer Kingdom / was Gods Glory in his manly Creatures / whom He had chosen to himself / to thend that they
shoulde 1.

BEholde: Thatsame true and like Bee∣ing of God, which is flowed or borne out of the eternall and liueing Godhead / is the First-borne 1. Cor. 15. c.

Wher-vpon this present Letter is writ∣ten by HN / out of an Inclynation of the Loue: very profitable and needfull to the Vnderstanding therof / for all those that hope vpon God· vpon Christ· and vpon their Saluation / To thend that they may vnderstand which is the right Grounde of the Beleefe in Iesu Christ / wherthrough one is iustifyed from the Sinne / for to be in-that-sort / reconciled with God in a newe Lyfe, according to the Scripture. The First Chap. FOrasmuch as I haue alwayes founde my self willingly-bent to do thee Seruice / my be∣loued Brother. so do I also still fynde my self redy-pre∣pared therto. namely, in thatt wherin I may be seruiceable vnto thee / to a Guyding into the holy Vnderstanding / To thend yt thou {reversed ;}if God vouchsafe thesame; moughtest {reversed ;}through my small Seruice; be a little furthered to the good Knowledg in God and his Christ.
2. But seing I am alwayes carefull, and do stand in feare to wryte much of the deepe Groundes of the Rom. 11. ▪ secret Knowledges of God and Christ / so am I alwayes carefull / lest that thesame (if we should wryte boldly therof) mought thrust-back anyone from Vs and our godly Doctrine, or offende him therby: or that anyone shoulde desyre to glory or to boste therin / as in a Knowledg of the Flesh. and not before althings or with his whole Heart / to be par∣taker in the Spirit / 2 Pet. 1. a. of the Beeing wherof we do wryte or witnes. 3. For albeit that we do knowe well {reversed ;}accord∣ing to the Comprehention of our Natural-rea∣son; that ther is a God, a Christ, and a holy Gost / and so do talke of Them: and yet do not {reversed ;}through that Knowledg; beleeue, serue, nor loue thesame God / as He is a God, and his Christ / as He is a Christ, and the holy Gost / as He is an holy Gost / nor-yet desyre to be∣com partakers of his Beeing: but to liue in a Rom. 1.  Ephe. 4. b. strainge Beeing / which is none of Gods Bee∣ing, and to cleaue-vnto thesame / So is then the Knowledg of the holy Secretnes of God / more hurtfull then furdersom vnto vs. For if we knowe in what Foorme or Beeing / that ther is a God: and yet do not honour nor serue Him / as He is a God: but haue a Lust to the Contrary-beeing vnto God / Then is thatsame to a Mat. 25. c. Luk. 12. c more-greeuous Condemnation vnto vs.
4. SEing now that I {reversed ;}through the Light; do beholde these Perills / so am I like∣wyse carefull therin / to wryte of the Secrets of God / before Many. And if thou lookest with me into the Perils / then knowe I well / that thou wilt not disalow me in my Carefulnes. For I haue much-more delyte in the Obeying of the Requyring of the Seruice of Loue / and whear Gods Beeing, Light, or vpright Righteousnes / doth euenso then ryse-vp in Esa. 58. b. Power / in the inward Man / then whear as men do with Speakable-woords {reversed ;}out of the Knowledg; talke much of the Secretnes of God / according to the outward Maner. 5. Thou also knowest partly my Conuersa∣tion / in what sort it was with thee, and how fearfully touching many Woords / I haue be∣haued myself with thee: shewing thee / that the Math. 13. Secretnes of the Kingdom of God or Christ / consisteth not 1 Cor. 2 a. in the Multitude of Woords, nor in the Ritches of the Knowledg / Because that thou shouldest not suffer thyself to be be∣witched by Anyman with outward or strainge Woords or Sayings of plentiful-store of Lan∣guages / as to let thyne Heart committ Whor∣dom therwith. But that thou moughtest haue a much-more regard vnto the Power of God, and vnto the vpright Righteousnes that God worketh through the Ministration of his gra∣cious Woord and Seruice of Loue / in ye Spi∣rit of the inward Man / to thend for to liue vp∣rightly therin / with a meeke-mynded Spirit.
For a meekemynded Psal. . b Esa. 57. b 61. a. 66. a Spirit {reversed ;}which hath his Proceeding obediently / according to the Re∣quyring of the Lords Woord; is very precious and acceptable before God. 6. And although that we do {reversed ;}in thesame Spi∣rit;  go-on in Scilence / as touching the out∣ward Maner, and are poore of Spirit in Tongues or Languages / Yet is not for-al-that / the Ritchnes of the spirituall and heauen∣ly Knowledg of God▪ euer-the-lesse among Vs. but rather the greater: And thesame, and all Thatt which is of God and Christ / do we esteeme very Iob. 28. b. Psal. 19 b. Pro. 3 b 8 b Sap. 7. b. precious / Yea much worthyer then all the Ritches or costly Treasures of this Worlde: for thatsame {reversed ;}of worthynes-part; excelleth it all. For which Occasion / we let our Woordes be feawe / because that thesame which we speake / may not proceede out of the Know∣ledg. but out of the 1. Cor 2. a. b Power of God, and out of the Trueth of Iesu Christ. 7. And in thesame Speech of ye godly Things / we do also take-heede with Foresightfulnes {reversed ;}so much as we may therin; of the Looseones of Heart / to thend that ther be not one godly Saying of the precious secret Wisdom / spo∣ken-out in Vayne. O / how Eccli. 14.25 Ieam. 5 ahappy is hee / that falleth not in his Tongue, and whose Woordes Col. 4. a. are tempered with Salt. 8. NOw this being omitted. I reioyce me doutles / of the, and of the Commu∣nialte  that is with thee: and I hope to reioyce me yet more with the / with greater Ioye, by
meanes of the Answere vnto mee / that I haue hearde from thee / As that yee altogether / are wel-mynded to Thatt which is the Beeing it∣self / wherof the Scripture witnesseth {reversed ;}as per∣sonally; of God, of Christ, and of the holy Gost. Which Beeing {reversed ;}for those that be par∣takers therof; are the secret Treasures and Math. 13 c heauenly Ritches of God / wherof the Worlde· the ritch Scriptur-learnedones· nor the Good-thinking-wyse {reversed ;}with all their deep-groundly Knowledg; do neither knowe nor vnderstand Math. 11 c 1. Cor. 2. a. anything-at-al. 9. It is true, they haue the Scripture of the godly Witnesses: wher-through they suppose to be wyse and vnderstanding. But seing they giue not their Vnderstanding captiue vnder the Obedience of the Loue of Iesu Christ, and com Iohn. 5. not euenso to the Beeing / wherof the Scripture speaketh, nor-yet beleeue theron / Iohn, 7. d as the Scripture sayth / So is-ther likewyse no Light, nor Trueth, nor-yet Spirit nor Beeing of God / among them / and they also do neither knowe nor Math. 22 c. 1. Tim 1. a vnderstande Thatt which they themselues speake therof. 10. But the God of Lyfe {reversed ;}Ephe. 2 a who is ritch of Mercie; hath {reversed ;}out of his harty Loue; Ephe. 1. a 2. a 3. a.

For thesame Light that shyneth now vnto Vs / out of the heauenly Trueth / 1. Ioh 1. a. is the euerlasting Lyfe, which was with the Father / in the Begining: and it is Psal. 45. a Heb. 1. a. the Mercie-seate of the godly Maiestee, which continueth from euerlasting to euerlasting: Euen-as I likewyse haue talked with thee of thesame / when I was last with thee. The II. Chap FOrasmuch then as thy Request was vnto me at that tyme / to wryte  thee an Instruction of the Mediation of Iesu Christ after the Spirit: and how thesame cometh-to-pas in vs / Rom. 3.  2.

God is all in all / Therfore wil I open a little of thesame vnto thee: and I hope also to satisfy the well with this Instruction. 2. Inasmuch then as I haue partly marked thyne Inclynation to the holy and spirituall Vnderstanding of the vpright Righteousnes / therfore can I not of Natures-part omitt / but must witnes vnto the of thatt which thou de∣syrest at my handes / also reueale the Ephe 3. a Mistery of Christ / and make-knowen vnto thee / thatt which is hidden Rom. 15. c Ephe. 1 a 3 a Col. 1. c. before the Worlde and all her Wyseones / and discribe it vnto thee in wryting / accordingly as the Lorde illuminat∣eth myne Vnderstanding therto, and as it may be profitable for thee to Edifycation. 3. THer is testifyed in the Scripture {reversed ;}the which according to the Spirit / is also verytrue; that God is Iohn 4. c. 2 Cor. 3. b. a Spirit▪ and a 1 Iohn. 1. a very∣true Light / with whom no Darknesses or Sinnes are mingled. But seeing that the Man is falne Gen. 3. a Esa. 59. b. into a strainge Contrary-beeing vnto God, and goeth-on and liueth therin / So is he likewyse Ephe. 4 b. Col. 1. c estrainged from God and from his Light: and walketh according to the Flesh or Outward, and according to the Requyring and Desyres of the Foreskinne of his vncir∣cumcised Heart / and not according to the Spi∣rit, or according to the Requyring of the godly Beeing: and so He Psal. 82. a Ephe. 5. a walketh in the vngodly Beeing of the Darknesses: and thatsame vn∣godly Beeing of the Darknesses Rom. 1. c. Ephe 4. b. hath blynded his Heart. And thatt veryly is the Sinne, Esa. 59. a.
which seperateth the Man from his God: and it is the Ephe 2 b Middle-wal / as an Enimitee be∣twixt God and the Man. By meanes of which Middle-wall / both God and the Man / are growen into two Parts, and are partially-mynded against eahother. Yet ought they both {reversed ;}God and the Man; to be Iohn. 17.   Ephe. 5. d One, like as it was Gen. . . in the Begining. 4. SEing now therfore that they are deuid∣ed {reversed ;}either of them in his owne Mynde; Gal. 5. b. against each-other / so is God {reversed ;}Iohn. 4. c. 2 Cor. 3. b. who is a Spirit; spirituall and mynded to all vpright Righteousnes / against the Mynde of the Man: and the Man {reversed ;}who is Gen. 6. .

But seing that the Dark∣nes / the sinfull Flesh or vngodly Beeing / is growen betwixt God and the Man / as a Fore∣skinne Esa. 59.  Ephe. 2. or Middle-wall, and as an Enimitee: and that God / is spiritually mynded, and the vncircumcised Man / fleshly mynded / accord∣ing to the Mynde of his Foreskinne of the sin∣full Flesh / Therfore doth not the Rom  1 Cor▪  Man vn∣derstande the spirituall Mynde of God the Fa∣ther,
neither-yet knowe the good Will of God / that loueth him to Saluation: and he beleeu∣eth not God in his Woord nor Seruice: but he beleeueth the Darknesses which haue inclosed him: and following thosesame Lustes Ephe. 4. b of Er∣rour / he goeth-back: and so sinneth dayly against the Father.

The Beleefe / 1. Cor. 2. a. Ephe. 1. c. 3. c Phil. 3. c. is the Power, as mighty to bring-to-light all Good / ther-through. 11. This Power / is the Deede or the Worke of all Good, and Phil 2. b. the Accomplishment of all the Workes of God. 12. BEholde: Such a Spirit or Beeing /  is the true God / of whom the Scripture speaketh, and vnto whom the Man ought to turne him. For Hee ؛thesame God{punctel} is the right Father, who {reversed ;}out of himself and through the like Beeing of his Godhead; hath made en. 1. a. Psal. 3. a. Iohn. 1. a. Ephe. 3. a. all that is anything. And all his Psal. 19. a. 9. a. 97. a. Rom. 1 c.

This euerlasting God, seing that He hath made Pro. 8. b. Iohn. 1. . all that is anything / through his like Beeing (for that thesame like Beeing / shoulde
he Heb. 1. . an Heire in all Things) hath also in the Begining / foormed Gen. . c. Sap. 2. c. Thatsame ؛his very-like Beeing in the Man: And so hath God made and ordayned euery-thing Eccli. 39. ▪ well / through his godly Beeing.

For in noman els but in thatsame only  Christ, Iohn. 1. is the Lyfe. Which Lyfe / is a Light of Men: and that Light shyneth in the Dark∣nesses: and the Darknesses haue not compre∣hended it. 16. Thatsame is a verytrue Light, Iohn 8. b. which lighteth all Men / through his Coming into this Worlde: and He was in the Worlde, and the Worlde was made through Him, but the Worlde knew Him not. 17. He came into his Owne, and his Owne receaued Him not. But so many as receaued Him / to them gaue He the Power to be Chil∣dren
of God. namely, Those that beleeued on his Name / which are not borne of Blood, nor of the Will of the Flesh, nor-yet of the Will of Man / but of God. The IIII. Chap.

FOr-that-cause / be not thou offended at the Workes of God / with his Saincts. nor-yet at the Contempt which I suffer and beare at the handes of many false Hearts, and good-thinking Wyseones and Scriptur-learn∣ed: But note that the Lorde Psal 4 a. leadeth his Ho∣lyones wonderfully: and how that God Psal. 129. b.

In which horrible 1 Tim. 4. a. 2. Tim. 3. a. 2. Pet 2. a. 3. a. and daingerous Tyme / all Errours, Misunderstandings, and all Spi∣rits of the false Light / do now exceedingly beare-swaye.

The Ende of which corrupt ignorant Knowledg {reversed ;}which is an Hor∣rour to think vpon; is com before the Lorde. 3. Seing then that all manly Vnderstanding is so vtterly corrupted / with so many-maner of false Knowledges / therfore is-ther likewyse no∣thing but all Wo and Misery at-hande.

But now when Esa. 60.

6. Now {reversed ;}thatt being omitted; I wil {reversed ;}in breefe-maner; answer thy Letter / like-as thou doest Request / euen according to thatt Sight wher∣with I looke into it. Consider thou on the Mynde of the Vnderstanding. The II. Chap. THou wrytest vnto me / that thy  desyre and Longing hath bin to talke with me by Woord-of-mouth: and that partly / because ther was a Man at thy Howse / that shoulde seeme to haue tolde thee wonderful-things of Mee: That is to saye / that I was quitt of that which is Myne, and had geeuen it all ouer: and that I {reversed ;}acknow∣ledging all thesame to be as Dirt; sought Grace, Help, and Comfort / in the Outward-things: and desyred to be subiect ther-vnto▪ The which {reversed ;}as thou wrytest; was an Admira∣tion vnto thee: and that thou couldest not be∣leeue it. 2. Thou Beloued, looke rightly into the Trueth of this Matter. For whear no Distinc∣tion is witnessed / as that one distincteth not the Things wherof he speaketh / with Sensiblenes of Woords, but speaketh them foorth only with Boasting and Pryde and out of Partia∣tee or Dispyte / So is theare likewyse / the right Difference hardly to be conceaued / by those that heare thesame. 3. It is true nodout / that it hath gon won∣derfully
with Mee. For thatt which is happen∣ed vnto mee / is also wonderfull to myself Psal. 118. c. in myne owne Eyes. But to be quitt of all thatt which was Myne {reversed ;}which was myne owne / and not the Lordes, and had captiued me; / af∣ter thatt haue I doutles had a great Longing: and haue alwayes {reversed ;}seing I haue loued the Righteousnes; bent my self goodwillingly / to giue-ouer Math. 16. b. 19. c. and to forsake it all / so farr-foorth as I coulde knowe it· and obtayne the Grace before God therto. but not the holy Vnder∣standing / which is com vnto me out of the liueing Godhead / vnder the Obedience of the Loue. Of the which (as I suppose) hee happ∣ly that hath tolde thee of this Matter / hath not distinctly vnderstood the Grounde therof / in his Secretnes, and therfore hath not tolde thesame rightly vnto thee. but as his good-thinking Mynde did iudg it / according to his owne Conceaueing. 4. Because of this wrong Iudgment and of the false Reporte, I am partly constrayned to witnes thatsame apparantly vnto thee / which is happened vnto mee: and do confesse before thee, and before all those that loue the Trueth / that I {reversed ;}from that Tyme-foorth that I sought Gods Righteousnes; haue looked-into and esteemed thatt which was Myne {reversed ;}so much as I sawe into it; and all thatt which I knewe that was not Gods / for Phil. 3. a. Dirt. and likewyse longed with Desyre / for to be quitt of it. as al∣so haue laboured ther-after in tymes-past /
with Ignorance, and without any Diffe∣rence. 5. But the God of Heauen / who is ritch of vpright Vnderstanding and godly Wisdom / hath looked vpon me with mercifull Eyes / in myne Ignorance: and caused me {reversed ;}through his Grace: to see-into myne Ignorance, and into my vntymely or vnfruitfull Zeale. And so by the Discerning of myne owne Ignorance / I also sawe into the vayne Race, Rom. 10. a. Gal. 4. b. and the igno∣rant Zeale of many Men, wherin they sought the Saluation. 6. Now when I sawe into all this, and hop∣ed dayly vpon Gods Mercie, and vpon the Coming of his Math. 6. b. Luk. 11.17. c Kingdom / then did the God of Heauen illuminate my Heart / with his Cleer∣nes: and the Luk. 17. Rom. 14. b. Apo. 12.21. . Kingdom of God in his perfect Beawty and Garnishing / came from on High into my Sight, and I behelde in the Spirit / Gods most-pure Beeing, the Mostholy of the true Tabernacle of God and Christ, and the most-vpright louely Lyfe of Peace / in the which / I {reversed ;}with the Beholding therof; reioyc∣ed me to-exceedingly: and thought not once / that ther mought yet som Vnpeaceablenes lye hidden. 7. When I now reioyced my self so wholly  heerin, I did sett all thatt which I had hated / quyte and cleane out of the Thoughts of my Soule: and ther stoode likewyse no Horrour nor Perrill before myne Eyes: For I had all my respect Fig. 1.2.4.  vppon the Kingdom of the per∣fect
Beawty and of the vpright louely Lyfe and Peace. 8. But now when I loued Caut. 5.4.5 thissame as my Best-beloued, I made none accounte of al myne Enemyes: neither had I also any Feare that-ther shoulde be anything that coulde hurt me. 9. But in this my Boldnes / myne Enemyes were subtill and crafty: and played or dallyed with me as my Freends, and were very freend∣ly vnto me. Wher-with they deceaued mee, and trayterously tooke me captiue, wherof I was not aware. The III. Chap. BVt when I now was wel-at-quy∣et in all thissame, and mistrusted no Deceit nor any Falshod in myne Ene∣myes / Psal. 32. b. c. 33. a. which were dayly conuersant with me according to the Flesh, and which were also my Freendes according to the Flesh / then did the Sleepe in the meane tyme / take-holde of me: and I rested boldly with them / as with my Freendes. 2. Thewhiles now I yet slept, and that the Night was com-on er-euer I awaked / so bounde they me very-fast / Psal. 40. b. with strong Bandes, and brought me whether they woulde. 3. But now when I was awakened-vp from my Sleepe, and opened myne Eyes / then was it altogether darke in the Place whear
they had brought me: and I knew not whear I was, neither-yet knew the Place whear I founde myself. 4. I likewyse sawe no Beawty nor Lyfe of Peace / in thesame Place: For thatt was then hidden from me, or I was brought out of it / in my Sleepe: but I sawe that those which seemed to be my Freendes / had turned Psal. 8. b. them∣selues about against me / as Enemyes. 5. Then was I sore greeued, and wofull of Heart: and I missed the sweete Waters which I before-tyme had tasted out of the liueing Fountayne. And in my Suffering and Wo∣fulnes / my Refreshing was with bitter Waters. 6. And the heauenly Beeing of the liueing Godhead {reversed ;}wherout the louely Deaw and the Ioyful-oyle came vnto me in tymes-past; did I wel remember: but thatt was to my greater Greefe. For I coulde not fynde thesame. But an hellish horrible Beeing / shone-about me / wherin I behealde nothing-els but Wo, Sor∣row, and Misery. And round-about me / it was full of horrible Enemyes: and eueryone sought after my Lyfe / for to deuoure me. And those that before / seemed to be my Iob. 19. b. Psal. 38 b Freendes / did also rage all at me / like hellish Doggs: and crying-out their owne Wickednes / they did eueryone Apo. 12. accuse me. and that I was full of Vnrighteousnes or Wickednes, and must be damned in the euerlasting Payne of the hellish Fyre.
7. Against all these Accusers {reversed ;}myne Ene∣myes; I coulde nothing-at-al resist: For I was bounde with their Bandes. 8. But when I was aware that I was bounde by them, then I lamented sore ouer my Bandes / because that I {reversed ;}by reason therof▪ mought not smyte-doune myne Enemyes. For I was kindled with Wrath towards them / because I had shewed them nothing but Freendshipp, and that they recompenced it me with Euell. 9. But when-as I {reversed ;}in my Sorrow; thought vpon the Light and Lyfe of Peace / which I myssed, then was I out-of-measure sorrow∣full. And then cryed I to the Lorde, and my Lamentacion and Complaynt was heard farr-abroade among the People. 10. I wrote also my Moorning-songs, and ther went-out from me / a dolefull Dittee: but ther came none that did release me from my Bandes / wherin I was trayterously bounde. 11. Somm now lamented my Case: and I was also by Somm / mocked and laughed-at and many grew offended at me, and spake all Euell of me, and brought-vpp many euell Bruits of me, wherwith they falsly belyed me. And whearsoeuer I went or stoode / thear did myne Enemyes incompas Psal. 22.8. b. 109. a. me, and were still rounde-about me. 12. But when I founde myself without Com∣fort / in this Forsaken-estate / then sought I
agayne Cant 4.5. and asked in euery Waye / after the∣same louely Beeing of Gods heauenly Beawty / which I {reversed ;}in Cleernes and Righteousnes; had both seene and loued. The One tolde me this, the Other poynted me on Thatt: but noman satisfyed myne Vnderstanding. For I had seene greater and more-gloryous things / then those wherof was tolde me and wherunto I was poynted. Therfore likewyse I founde nowhere any Refreshing nor Comfort: For I founde not Thatt which I had seene before, and loued with my Heart. 13. Beholde, after thissame louely and true Beeing of God / haue I sought in myne Extre∣mitee / to thend to be released by thesame / from my Bandes and wicked Enemyes, and to be subiect to thesame Beeing / if I mought ob∣tayne that Grace. I haue also asked after it / of Mē, to see if happly I coulde fynde it among Any-people: and haue dilligently sought the Wayes that leade therunto / To thend that I (for to inherite euenso the Lyfe of Peace) mought haue com agayne into the right Path, and that myne Enemyes mought be rooted-out· and thatt recompenced them / which they had Psal. 2. a. 62. b. Ier. 17. b. Lamen. . g. deserued on mee. 14. THou Beloued: Vnderstande now heer∣out / which it is that I haue accounted for Dirt, and what hath bin my Seeking and  Desyre. For which such afflicted Seruants of the Lorde {reversed ;}which do loue the vpright Bee∣ing / with all their Hearts; I do alwayes make
Supplication and Prayer vnto the Lorde: and do saye out of all my Soule: 15. O Lorde, breake-asunder the Bandes of the Vngodly I beseeche thee: and vouchsafe to giue Strength vnto thyne inclyned Seruants / to raigne with thee ouer all their Enemyes. 16. O God, let thy Seruants go ouer them, and tread vppon them with Esa. 41. c. Mich. 7. b. their Feete / like Lome / To thend that they may euenso {reversed ;}with thy Wisdom and Foresightfulnes; enter boldly into thy Loue ؛thy Paradise of Lyfe{punctel} for to possesse ye worthy and restfull Lande of Peace, and the holy Citee Ierusalem / Ier. 30. b. c. Zach. 1. b buylded anew vppon her olde Foundation, wheron thou {reversed ;}O God; hast in tymes-past foreseene to buylde thesame / for that thy Psal. 51. b Esa. 56. a. Mal. 3. a. Offering may be made thear, and thy Laude-song of Sion, be soung thear for euermore. and not in Babylon, nor in the North Landes / euen-as thou {reversed ;}O God; hast Ier 3.16. b 23. a. Mich. 4.5. b forespoken thesame by thy Pro∣phets. The IIII. Chap. FArdermore thou writest vnto me / that thy Longing was for to talke with Mee thy self / because that the∣same which I had written vnto thee / made thee so exceedingly to wonder, and was beyonde thyne Vnderstanding: and for that I complayned me of the Accusers / because they complayned on Me and accused me so falsly be∣fore
the Iudgment / for to be condemned and rooted-out. 2. Thissame seemeth that it hath bin a Won∣der vnto thee / because (as thou wrytest) such a Light and Knowledg was risen-vp vnto Me before. And fardermore: When thou then re∣memberest the Songs that I haue made, thou sayest vnto Me / demaunding: Had the Spirit quyt forsaken thee / in thy Forsaken-estate? Oh, what shall I saye! I must keepe-silence heerof, inasmuch as I haue neuer founde my∣self in such great Forsakennes. 3. O Thou Beloued / If thou hadst consi∣dered well on the Psal. 22. a. Math. 27. c. Forsakennes of Christ, and on the Forsakennes of all his Saincts / who do follow-after Him in the For∣sakennes of his Crosse / Then wouldest thou not haue wondered. For euenso sayth the holy Scripture vnto vs likewyse / Act. 14. that we must enter into the Kingdom of God / thorow much Tribulation and Affliction. 4. For such-a-matter (if we suffer-out the∣same with Patience) is the Death Rom. 6 c. Phil. 2. a. of the Crosse of Christ, wherby we be planted into Christ (as the Scripture sayth) with the lyke Death. Wher-through we do also inherit with Christ [namely, in the secōde Birth from the Death] the godly Ritches of God the Father / in the euerlasting Lyfe, and be worthy to raigne vp∣pon the Earth / Apo. 5. b. with Christ and all his Saincts.
5. But touching ye Complayning ouer myne Accusers / I haue sufficiently distincted vnto thee before. But let not my Tribulation and Calamytee cause thee to wonder: For inas∣much as it neuer happened vnto thee / therfore is it all doutles whatsoeuer thou hearest therof / the strainger before thyne Eares. 6. But like as thy Longing hath bin towards Mee / so haue I in-like-maner / longed after thee / for to talke with thee of this Matter: but it is not so com-to-pas. Notwithstanding / I hope the Lorde shall once bring vs together / so wil I then vtter-foorth my Heart alittle with thee / of all that is chaunced vnto mee. For I fynde very-feawe of those / with whom I dare be bolde or openhearted. 7. But thou knowest from the begining / the Course of my Zeale to the Righteousnes: euen-as I do thyne also: and I haue neuer kept my Mynde secret from thee. nor-yet thou thyne / from Mee. Seing then y• thou hast alwayes bin openhearted with mee / therfore am I like∣wyse / the-bolder to talke with thee of althings. 8. Howbeit / if the Mynde of certen Vnder∣standings or of somme Sentences had remayn∣ed hidden from many Ignorantones / it had bin good for them / because that the Ignorant∣ones do seeke nothing-els but their Selfnes. But doutles, whatsoeuer doth not in al-poynts / giue-ouer itself obediently vnder the gracious Woord and his Seruice of Loue / thatsame doth alwayes turne itself out either
to the one syde or to the other / for to follow-after the Rom. . c. Lusts of his Errour. 9. For-that-cause, seing it is now knowen  vnto vs / that the Disobedientones to the holy Woord, and the Ignorant and Lyghtmynded∣ones / are alwayes mynded to Errour / Ther∣fore let vs vse Foresightfulnes in all our Woords: and so before all Things / couet after the 1. Cor. 14. c. Loue. and drawe the Deuoutones / vn∣der the Loues Obedience. 10. Whosoeuer then do submitt them vnder the Obedience of the Loue· cleaue vnto the Loue in her Seruice / with all their Hearts· and {reversed ;}with naked Hearts; wholly giue-ouer themselues {reversed ;}in the Comunialtee of Saincts; to the Howse of Loue / to all Concord, and to the 1. Pet. 1. b. c. Obeying of the gracious Woord / To Those shall men {reversed ;}in all Loue; disclose the Math. 13. b. Se∣cretnes of the holy Vnderstandings and of the Kingdom of the God of Heauens / To thend that Gods secret Ritches, and the Vnderstand∣ings of his holy Wisdom / may be knowen to the Obeyers of his Woord / in the Nature or Beeing of his Loue. For veryly, the Diso∣beyers of the Woord, as also the self-seeking Ignorantones, and those that think them∣selues to be wyse or skilfull / They Iohn. . . iudg the secret Mynde of the Loue and of the Kingdom of God / cleane-contrary in euery-behalf. 11. And if-so-be then that they stande not  submitted obediently {reversed ;}with all their Hearts; vnder the Woord of Information / according
to the Pro. 1.2.3.4. Eccli. 4.8. b Counsayle of the Wisdom / so do they then {reversed ;}with Misunderstanding; take euery thing quyt contrary / according to their owne good-thinking Mynde of the earthly Wisdom: and do therin corrupt themselues, and like∣wyse all their Vnderstanding / through their Self-seeking and fleshly Lusts and Desyres. 12. Therfore let the Wisdom be esteemed more-precious / then anything that may be imagined in the Worlde: For ther is nothing in the Worlde / to be compared Pro. 3 b. 8. b Sap. 8. a. to the Wisdom and to her secret Treasures. 13. Inasmuch now {reversed ;}thou Beloued; as that thou knowest thissame / therfore be thou in-any-wyse farr from the Mockers / which walke according to their Rom. 1. c owne Desyres: and be a Strainger to the Lyghtemyndedones: and auoyde thou from all those which do seeke on∣ly the earthly Things. Heer-vppon let vs al∣wayes think / in thissame euell and perrilous Tyme. The V. Chap. THou wrytest also vnto me / that thy Sight is / that thou doest not so knowe God / as that He shoulde still deale rygorously with his People, like∣as He hath don in the olde Testament, euen as ther standeth written. 2. I haue not doutles written vnto thee / that God hath dealt rygorously with mee. but that
his Enemyes (as is also before rehearsed) haue dealt rygorously with me / with Crueltee and Accusation, euen as they haue likewyse shewed in Psal. 42.44. b. 69 b  102 b. 109. e. Math 26.27. Act 22 23. tymes-past / on Christ and his Saincts. 3. These woulde gladly haue satisfyed their Lust on me / to my Destruction: Of whom I had written vnto thee / that I hoped to see my Desyre on myne Enemyes and Accusers. namely, that they / all those that accused me, and woulde gladly haue seene my Destruction; shoulde be iudged into the Condemnation themselues. 4. Looke into the matter rightly: For euen∣so  soundeth the Letter that I haue written vnto thee. and not that God dealeth rygorous∣ly with his People / neither hath He also at any tyme {reversed ;}as neither now presently nor-yet in the olde Testament; dealt rygorously· but al∣wayes graciously with them: but I haue bin constrayned by myne Enemyes {reversed ;}for my Sinnes cause; to suffer my Punishment for a certen∣tyme / like as the Lordes People also / in the olde Testament / were constrayned by their Enemyes {reversed ;}of whom they were captiued; to suffer-out their Punishment / for their Sinnes cause. For, for their Sinnes cause / the holy Citee Ierusalem, 4. Reg. 2. 2. Par. 36. Ier. 5. and the Temple of the Lorde were layd-waste / and they lead-away captiue, and very-sore punished / vnder the Power of Babel. 5. But after thatt / when they obtayned the Grace agayne before their God, Ier. 32. Zach. 8. and that their
Harts were cleansed / both from the Sinne and the sinfull Desyres / they were brought agayne out of the strainge Nations / to their owne Lande and Heritage, and to the holy Citee Ie∣rusalem / the which {reversed ;}and also the Temple of the Lorde; was buylded 1 Esd. 3. Ezech. 40. Agg. 1.2. Zach. 2.4.6. agayne anew / in thesame Tyme, for to offer holy Gifts and Of∣ferings euen-thear vnto their God / that are delytfull vnto Him: the which they coulde not doo among the strainge People, nor in forrayne Landes: neither coulde they likewyse sing Psal. 137. a. their Songs of Sion / in their Captiuitee in Babilon: but they must thear beare their Con∣tempt / for their Sinnes cause. 6. Consider well of the Mynde, and looke into the Images of the olde Testament / ac∣cording to the Spirit, and according to the Trueth: and how that it shall all now that is set-foorth Ezo. 25. c. Act 7. c. Heb. 8. a. image-lyke in the Olde-testament / be Math. 5. b. accomplished in the true Beeing. Besydes-this / so consider also / how that God hath neuer dealt rygorously with his People: and Psal. 13.6. how that his Goodnes endureth for euer. The VI. Chap. BUt thou wrytest: Hath He not taken on him the manly Nature, and therin geeuen vs a Promyse: in such-sort / as that his Sonne shoulde performe or satisfy all for vs? And for those that rightly vnderstande it / He hath per∣formed
it all / according as thou Vnderstandest the matter. 2. OH! Heer-vpon mought I take occa∣sion to wryte much / because ther is so much and many-kyndes of Misunderstand∣ing risen-vpp out of such Sentences or Iudg∣ments. But I hope well of the best Vnder∣standing / in thee: Neuerthelesse / with doubt. 3. It is true: Hee which is all that is ؛the God of Glory{punctel} hath {reversed ;}in Christ; taken on him the Phil. 2. a. Heb. 2. b. manly Nature, and geeuen vs a Pro∣myse therin: but thatsame is don with Dif∣ference. 4. Therfore looke into the Scripture / ac∣cording to the Mynde of the Wisdom. and not according to the Vnderstanding of the earthly and fleshly Myndes. 5. For God taketh not on him / the Seede of  the Heathen, nor the Nature of the Vncircum∣cisedones. but / Heb. 2. b. the Seede of Abraham, which beareth in him / the Couenant of Gods Cir∣cumcision: and in thatt Seede Gen. 12.21 b 22. b. 26. a Act. 3. c. Gal. 3. a. b is the Promyse of Saluation, or the Blessing of all Genera∣tions of the Earth / geeuen. 6. And euenthus hath the Seede of Abra∣ham the Promyse / to possesse the Gen. 12.17. Psal. 105. b. Lande of Canaan [namely, the Kurnell or the Heart of the Heathen] as an Heritage / for euer. For inasmuch as Abraham beleeued / therfore is he likewyse chosen of God / Gen. 17. a. Rom. 4. b. to be a Father of Fayth: and called out of the Heathen or Vn∣circumcision / into the Couenant of Gods Cir∣cumcision:
and euenthus in his Fayth and in his Seede / is the Promyse made, to the Bless∣ing of all Generations of the Earth. 7. Which Promyse standeth-firme for euer / in the Woord of Lyfe, and in the Fathers of the Couenant: Wherout also all Gods Pro∣phets haue had their cleere Sight and Testy∣mony of the Trueth, and Esa. 40.60.62. Ier. 13. a. 30. a. 31.33. so haue prophecied Luk. 1.8. 1. Pet 1. b. on the Establishing of the Promyses. 8. Beholde, this Promyse (euen as God had  spoken to the Fathers of the Couenant· Act. 30. and by the Mouth of all his holy Prophets) is sealed, confirmed, or established on the Stock of Iuda Math. 1. Luk. .1.2. b. the Sonne of Iacob / wherout Da∣uid is borne. From whom / Gen. 49. b. the Rodd is not taken, nor a Master from his Feete / till that the Iust com: For to Him shall the People inclyne, and obtayne their Saluation in Him, according to the Promyses. 9. This Iustone (consider wel of the Vnder∣standing) is the Sap. 7. c. . Cor. 4. a. Col 1. b. very-lyke Beeing of God the almighty Father: And Hee {reversed ;}in his Birth out of the liueing Godhead according to the Spi∣rit, Rom 1. a. 1. Tim. 3. c▪ and out of the Seede of Dauid accord∣ing to the Flesh; is verytruly the Sonne of God and Man, and the true Sauiour Luk. 2. b. Phil. 3. c. 1. Tim. 4. c. of Men / to the Blessing of all Generations of the Earth, according to the Promyses. 10. Therfore also hath the Power of God named Luk. 1.  2. c Him Iesus: and He is by his Dis∣ciples / published among all People / Act. 2.3 4.5. &c. to be a Christ which saueth.
11. Beholde, this vpright and true Beeing of God the Father (which according to the Flesh / is Esa. 53. a b. Sap. 2. b. Math. 27. mocked, contemned, and killed by the Children of the wicked Worlde, and by her Wyse and Scriptur-learnedones) woulde God {reversed ;}according to his Promyses and the Af∣firmation of his Prophets; that the Man shoulde carry 1. Cor. 15. c or beare / to his owne Blessing, and to the Honour of God, and to the Prayse of his holy Name. And not the Sinne / Sap. 2. c. Iohn. 3. . that very-like Beeing of the Diuell. 12. With which vngodly or lyke Beeing of the Diuell, and also with Offenciuenes and wicked Imaginations / many Men do runne-on: and so do suppose {reversed ;}through their corrupt Vnderstanding and vngodly Beeing; to be saued for-al-that▪ they do likewyse com∣fort Ier 8  themselues with Lyes, and saye / Christ hath performed it all: and so they continue go∣ing-on in Ier. 4.  . a. their Sinnes and Abhominations or wicked Imaginations. 13. AH beloued, Consider I pray thee / of such a great Misunderstanding / that is flatt against all the Preaching of the holy Gospel of Christ. For the Scripture of the holy Gospel mentioneth and witnesseth cleer∣ly vnto vs / that Christ is obediently gon-before Phil. 2. a. 1. Pet. 2.4. . vs / in the Death of the Crosse / to thend that wee likewyse shoulde follow-after Christ therin / to ye Mortifying, Col. 2. or to a Con∣sumeing of our Sinnes and of all vngodly Bee∣ing [the which is the true Burnt-offering]:
as also shoulde be incorporated vnto Him / with his lyke Rom 6. a. Phil. 3. b. Death, and euenso to the Establish∣ing of the gloryous Name of God {reversed ;}according to his Promyses; shoulde becom saued. Ther∣on likewyse do all Gods Prophets witnes. 14. And if thou doest consider rightly from the Begining of the Promyses of God / till vn∣to their Ende or Fulfilling in the Saluation / Then shalt thou perceaue / that we be informed and taught with the Promyses of God, and with the Figures Rom. 3.4. Gal. 3.4. Heb 7.8.9.10. and Seruices of the Lawe / to the Fayth of Iesu Christ and the Seruice therof, and to the Requyring of the Preaching of the holy Gospel. And so foorth from the Seruice of the Fayth of Christ and of the ho∣ly Gospel / till vnto the Iohan. 13. d. 14. c. 15. b Loue and her Ser∣uice: And thesame is the Perfection, Rom. 13. b. 1. Cor. 13. a. Gal. 5. b. Col. 3. b. 1. Timo. 1. a and the Establishing or Fulfilling of the Promyses of God and Christ. 15. Therfore is the Seruice of Loue / the Ve∣ry-last and Most-holy / wherin Math. 22. d. it is all ful∣filled / whatsoeuer is written of the Righteous∣nes of the Lawe, and of Christ and his Be∣leeuers. For in the Loue and in her Children / God Apo. 21. is all in all, and the Kingdom of the God of Heauens with his Glory. 16. BEholde, This true Beeing of God the Father (like as is sayde therof) is the Stone that is layde in Sion / Esa. 28. b Act. 4. b. 1. Pet. 2. a. for to trust vpon it: wherof ther is also written: Esa. 59 c. Rom. 11. . He shall com out of Sion / which shall put-awaye the vngodly Beeing from Iacob.
17. And thatt is the seconde Testament {reversed ;}the which is the gracious Woord; Ier. 31. d. Rom. 11. e. Heb. 8.10. b that is pro∣mysed to the Howse of Israel and to the Howse of Iuda / in the last tyme: For then shall the Punishment for their Sinnes / be ended: and their Sinnes shall God nomore remember. For in thatt Daye {reversed ;}Iohn. 12. d. wherin the Sonne of Man is exalted; shall ye Sonne of Man drawe it all vnto Him, seing that the Inheritance doutles appertayneth vnto Him. 18. In this-self-same {reversed ;}which is the very-likie and true Beeing of God the Father; stand∣eth the Blotting-out Act. 4. b 10 c Heb. 1. a and Cleansing of our Sinnes / through Fayth, euen as is written of Him. 19. To be incorporated vnto Him with the  Spirit / is veryly the right Satisfaction of the Sonne of Promyse / the right Heb. 5. . Heyre of all god∣ly Goodes. 20. Of Him hath likewyse Esaias witnessed / whear he sayth: Esa 9. c. A Childe or an Heyre is borne vnto vs: a Sonne is geeuen vnto vs: whose Dominion is vppon his Shoulders / and He is called / Wonderfull, Counsayle, Power, Gyant, euerlasting Father, a peaceable Prince, for that his Dominion may be great, and no nde of the Peace / vppon the Seate of Dauid and his Kingdom. 21. Him hath God sett to be an  Heyre ouer all Things: Through Whom / He hath also made  the Worlde: and He maketh the  Cleans∣ing of our Sinnes / through Himself: and euen∣thus
standeth his Satisfaction according to the Promyses, like-as is written of Him. and not according to Mans Good-thinking or Imagination. The VII. Chap. THou wrytest likewyse vnto mee / that it is wel knowen vnto mee / that God hath created all Things / each-one according to his Kynde: in uch-sort, that all Creatures haue their Nature or Kynde / wherin they liue / and cannot trans∣gresse / and that thou doest also half cal-to-mynde / that thou hast heard it so of mee. 2. It is true / that all Creatures are created Gen. . according to their Kynde: and that each-one hath his Ordinance / according to his Kynde, which {reversed ;}of Natures-part; it cannot trans∣gresse. 3. Whatsoeuer now is incorporated vnto his owne Nature, and is not turned ther-out nor estrainged ther-from, but bydeth ther-in / thatt liueth then in his vpright  Nature, Bee∣ing, and Kynde / wherin it is created and wher∣to it is ordayned or foreseene of God. 4. COnsider {reversed ;}thou Beloued; God hath created all earthly Creatures, and ioyned each-one to his lyke / according to his Nature and Kynde. 5. After thesame maner also / the Creature of the Manhod: but the inward Man / hath
God created to Himself, and ordayned him to be a Leui. 26. b Ier. 31.  Iohn. 14. c. Apo. 21.  Dwelling for his Glory. 6. And God woulde not that this inward Man / shoulde be subiect to the outward creat∣ed or to the vayne Things, nor cleaue vnto them to a Bondage / to thend that the great Name of the almighty God / shoulde alwayes and euerlastingly byde sealed and stand-fast in the inward Man. 7. God hath likewyse foormed the Gen 1. c. Sap. 2 c very-like Beeing of his inuisible and liueing Godhead / in the inward Man / because that the Man shoulde liue according to the Requyring of his vpright Beeing, to the Laude and Prayse of his godly Maiestee. 8. Beholde and vnderstande: Thissame Bee∣ing  of God and Christ / is the Mans Nature and Kynde / according to the inward Man / wherunto he is created by God· and chosen through Iesus Christ, as also ordayned ther∣unto / to thend that he shoulde euenso haue all his Ioye, Delyte, and Lyfe / in thesame God∣head· and remayne incorporated to the Sap. 1. b. Im∣mortalitee of the euerlasting Lyfe. 9. To liue in thissame godly Nature and Kynde / is the vpright Nature and Kynde of the Man, as is sayde: And thatt is the Com∣maundement of God and the Lawe of the Lorde / which is geeuen or appoynted Him: and it is likewyse Gods Math. 3. . 17. a. 2. Pet. 1. b. Pleasure that the Man shoulde liue therin for euer. 10. This Commaundement, Lawe, Will,
Nature, and Kynde / can noman {reversed ;}of his Na∣tures-part; breake. but he may I graunt {reversed ;}ac∣cording to the Lusts of his owne Thoughtes, and according to the Lusts of his Transgres∣sion of the Ordinance of the Lorde; stepp out of Gen. 3. a it, and fall from thesame, or estrainge him∣self ther-from: euen-as we now do euidently or apparantly fynde that it is so com-to-pas with the Man / and that he perisheth therin / if he repent not. 11. For he hath forsaken the Ier. 2. b. Fountayne of his Lyfe, and is becom subiect to the deadly Things: and so hath mingled himself with the corruptible Mortalitee: By which meanes / all Destruction raigneth ouer the vnrepentant Man: and the vnmeasurable lying Beeing hath corrupted his Vnderstanding / with the Knowledg. and so hath stolen from him the vp∣right Mynde of his God: in such-sort, that hee for-that-cause knoweth or vnderstandeth too-to-little of his godly Nature and Kynde. Thissame is the Mans Fall, and his Deepe-sinking vnder the Sinne: and thatt is the vn∣godly Nature / against Gods Loue and Na∣ture, and agaynst the Loue and Nature of the Man. 12. In which vngodly Nature and corrupt Beeing / the Man cannot 1. Cor. 2. b taste the Ioye of the euerlasting Lyfe / which is godly, heauenly, and spirituall. For in the vngodly Nature / he is generally Iohn. 8. e nothing but deuilish and fleshly Rom. 8. a. mynded: and euenso tasteth only the Earthly,
and not the Heauenly / and so {reversed ;}out of his Good-thinking; taketh on Him thatt which is one with his Rom. 1. c. Ephe. 4. b owne Sensualitee, and not thatt which is one with the Outflowing of the Trueth of God / vnder the Obedience of the Loue. The VIII. Chap. BVt according as thou wrytest /  thou knowest not what thou shalt saye of ye outward Man. But it seemeth / yt thou demaunding of mee / sayest: Is not hee likewyse a seruiceable Instrumēt to his God / in thatt Nature wherunto he is created. 2. It is true: Hee is likewyse a seruiceable Instrument to his God▪ namely, in thatt Na∣ture {reversed ;}whether it be then the godly or the vngod∣ly; to the which he is subiect: like-as thesame is sufficiently rehearsed and distincted vnto thee before. 3. Therfore haue regarde vnto the Woord: and vse a Difference betwixt the inwarde and the outward Man. and in what an vpright Estate / the outward Man is likewyse a ser∣uiceable Instrument to his God. namely, in his vpright Foorme or Estate / as is sayde. 4. But without his vpright Foorme or E∣state / the Man {reversed ;}for his Sinnes cause; is like vnto a marred Instrument, Sap. 2. c.

Thissame hath the kingly Prophet Dauid rightly looked-into / when he saw-into the Mans Fall, Psal. 51. a and acknowledged his Sinnes or Transgression: wher-through he lamented his Sinnes and Corruption / in many Afflic∣tions and Sorrowes. and that he was like vn∣to a marred Instrument. 6. Euenso haue likewyse the Prophets and Men of God / lamented thissame eueryone / Esa. 33.59. a Ier 10 a 14 c Dan. 9. a. b when they saw-into the Fall of Men. namely, the Fall from their God. The IX. Chap. FArdermore, thou wrytest vnto mee / that thy Vnderstanding or Con∣eaueing is / that Christ is the Headd of vs all, and so must haue many Members: and that euery Member is seruice∣able to his Headd / in his Kynde. 2. Erre not heerin in-any-wyse / thou Belou∣ed. Many do saye indeede / out of a lying and vngodly Beeing / Christ is our Headd: wher∣as doutles the deuilish Nature ؛that Antichrist or Childe of the Deuill{punctel} is their Headd, and they / his Members. but not / out of the Crea∣tion of God, but out of the false Beeing Iohn. 8. Ephe . a. of the Deuill: the which they haue take-on will∣ingly {reversed ;}according to their owne Pleasure; as a Contrary-beeing vnto God, and do carry or beare thesame / as a Contrary-nature to their vpright Nature or Kynde.
3. Veryly, such are swallowed-vpp by the earthly Corruptiblenes, in whom all Blynd∣nes and Vnbeleef Ephe. 2.  hath is Worke. 4. Therfore also / they are all mynded accord∣ing to the comon Course of the wicked Worlde. and not according to the Nature of the Loue / the heauenly Trueth of God. 5. NOw seemeth it likewyse {reversed ;}according to  thy wryting; that thou wilt not excuse the Flesh of his Sinne / Because that much innocent Blood is sheadd {reversed ;}through thesame; with his Knowledg and misunderstanding Wisdom. 6. Ah, looke-into the matter of fellowship / according to the Trueth: How shoulde I pray thee / the innocent Blood be sheadd, and liue so wholly in all Wrong and Contrarynes / tho∣rough the Flesh and his Wisdom? Vnles that it were estrainged from his right Headd· sub∣iect to the Contrary-nature vnto God / wher∣of the Deuill is the Headd· and incorporated and seruiceable to thesame / as a Fellow-mem∣ber of Antichrist / the Deuils Childe: and that euenso the Deuill gouerned ouer him, who vseth the Flesh {reversed ;}as his seruiceable Instrument; to the Iniquitee / according to his Will. 7. So long then as any Flesh / is {reversed ;}with his Will; inclyned to the Iniquitee, and doth not beleeue to be iustifed or released Rom. 3 8. a Gal. 2. b. from the Sinne / through Christ / So hath it not Christ to be his Headd: nor he is not in all his Nature, Beeing, and Kynde / natured nor
mynded Rom. . a according to Gods Beeing and Na∣ture: vnles it were so that the Man had {reversed ;}with Good willingnes; turned him to God and his Righteousnes, and did vpright Math. 3. a.

BVt / that Flesh and Blood may not possesse 1. Cor. 25. f. the Kingdom of God (as thou wrytest) thatt is right nodout: Flesh and Blood hath no Inheritance nor Dominion or Lordshipp in the Kingdom of God. For Flesh and Blood ؛that earthly Beeing{punctel} is in his right Ordinance / the Esa. 66. a Act 7. c. Bench for the Lordes Feete: ouer the which / the Kingdom of God beareth his Dominion, and Christ / his Glory. 9. Of which Glory / the Members of Christ haue spoken in tymes-past (when-as the Lyfe of God or Christ was com vnto them / for to possesse them, and to be incorporated with them) saying and testifying: Iohn. 1. b The Woord is incarnated or becom Flesh, and dwelt among vs. Wherthrough they sawe his Glory, euen a Glory of the only borne Sonne of the Father / full of Grace and Trueth. 10. Beholde: This Glory of Christ / was the Kingdom Luk. 17. c. of God inwardly in them: the which had inherited them for a Possession / as
his Heritage: and their Spirit also / thatsame. and not / Flesh and Blood. 11. Consider well of the Mynde that I wryte vnto thee: and vnderstande the Resolu∣tion of my Vnderstanding: and Iohn. 7. . iudg with a right Iudgment. The X. Chap. THou sayest likewyse / out of the  Wryting of Ecclesiastes, Eccle. 12. a how that euery Thing must returne agayne / from whence it is com. Thatt which is out of God / shall returne thether agayne: and thatt which is of the Earth / shall be Earth agayne. 2. Oh {reversed ;}alas; heer-out is much Misunder∣standing taken-on: and many do runne-on in that sort / with this one Sentence, and haue no Discerning nor Consideration / to what ende the Sentence soundeth, nor wherto the whole Scripture stretcheth. And wil nodout {reversed ;}out of ther owne Good-thinking; include the Mynde of God {reversed ;}which they vnderstand not; in this one Sentence of the Scripture. And out of thesame they iudg euenthus: Let them liue how they wil liue, when they dye / their Spirit shall com agayne to God, and thr Body to the Earth. 3. Heerwithall do the lightmynded Hearts deceaue themselues, who haue no Lust to Gods Righteousnes: and yet for-al-that do
rest perswaded / that their Spirit {reversed ;}which is vngodded or not of God; shall com to God. 4. No {reversed ;}Beloued; No. God wil none of the wicked Spirits: but He putteth them away, and poynteth them from Him / Math. 25.  into the Con∣demnation of the hellish Fyer, which is pre∣pared for the Deuill and all wicked Spirits. 5. FOr-that-cause {reversed ;}thou Beloued; looke rightly into the Alteration of the Man. and in what maner / the Spirit of God which God hath formed in the Man; cometh to God. 6. For if it were so / that the Spirit of God {reversed ;}which God hath formed in the Man; shoulde alwayes vppon the Earth / remayne estraing∣ed or seperated from God, and from the Mans Beeing: and that the Man shoulde not {reversed ;}vppon the Earth; be incorporated to thesame / for an euerlasting Assurance Rom. 8. b of the Inheritance of Christ and of the Kingdom of the God of Heauens / in the eternall Lyfe: and so {reversed ;}with∣out Vniting Eqhe. 4. c. with the Mans Beeing / in Righteousnes; shoulde go to the Incorporat∣ing vnto his God first / when-as the Creature were passed-thorow the naturall Death / Who coulde then I pray thee / witnes and publish vppon the Earth / the Glory of God and the Powers of his Goodnes / to the Blessing and Sluation of the Man· and be seruiceable to the Man / to an Incorporating to thesame Goodnes of God? 7. Therfore haue now in consideration / how,
and wherin the Fulnes of the Mynde of the Scriptures concisteth: and whether that the Vnderstanding of God be wholly declared in the Man / when-as he so taketh vnto him one Sentence out of the Scripture / according to his Good-thinking, and so goeth-on therwith / without Discerning of the godly Wisdom: and doth not once consider / wherto that one Sentence serueth, from whence it proceedeth, nor to what ende it stretcheth. 8. Euenthus {reversed ;}thou Beloued; let vs consider  rightly on the Mynde of the Scriptures: Standeth-ther not written also / Sap. 1. . that the Wisdom dwelleth not in a Body that is subiect vnto Sinne? Therfore cannot likewyse an vn∣godded Man· nor-yet one that remayneth without the Comunialtee of the Family of Loue / iudg one Sentence of the holy Scrip∣ture / rightly according to the Trueth, nor-yet out of the Wisdom. 9. But wheras Ecclesiastes speaketh Eccle. 12. a. of the Earth and of God: as that each-one that is Earthly and of God / goeth to his owne Incorporating / Therof I wil aske thee som∣what: 10. When now this Alteration cometh-to-pas with the Man, shall then the Nature of the Iniquite haue his Possession with the Man, or be mingled with him as an Heyre? Or shall he be thrust-out with the Vnfreeone? Gen. 21. b Gal. 4. . I do veryly suppose / Yea, according to the Promyses. For beholde:
11. Wil not God inhabite his Tabernacle 2. Cor. 6. b or Temple alone: and dryue-out of it / all Esa. 35.52. a. Apoc. 21. c. that is vncleane, or that defyleth the Howse of the Lorde? Is not the Heauen also / his Seate. and Esa 66  Act. 7. c. the Earth / the Bench for his Feete? 12. BEholde, to this Glory of God, and for that thesame shoulde raigne ouer the Man / is the Man chosen: and likewyse in his Fall / called and bidden therunto agayne / by Christ / Because that he shoulde serue and liue-vnto his God only / in all Luk. 1.8. Righteousnes and not cleaue-vnto the wicked Spirit▪ nor-yet iudg thesame for the Spirit of God: through the which / he keepeth God, as also his good Spirit / out of his Dwelling. 13. And whosoeuer then / through his Good-thinking, and through his wicked Spirit or vngodly Beeing / keepeth the God of Lyfe out of his Dwelling, and with a false Opinion or with an Enuyousnes towards any Man / doth comfort or quyet himself therin / Hee doth willingly giue-ouer himself to the Curssing and perpetuall Condemnation. 14. For what other Dwelling for God / wil anyman imagine I pray thee: or what other Tabernacle or Temple of God / wil anyman make 2. Pa. 6. d Esa. 66. a Act. 7. e. {reversed ;}wherin God wil dwell; but the Man / Iob. 14. b. Psal. 138. a. that Worke of his Hande? For thatt is the Lordes Lust, Pro. 8. d. Iohn. 14. d. for to dwell therin / with his vpright Beeing or Christ. But most-tymes (when the Lorde mooueth the Man ther-to /
by his Ministers) the Man remayneth cap∣tiued vnto his owne Knowledg, and so deny∣eth to yeelde himself Ier. 7. c 16 b 27.29. b & Act 7. c. 17 c to thesame Grace of the Lorde: so that most-tymes / ther-are Feawe that suffer themselues to be prepared for an Habitation of God, the which is greatly to be lamented. 15. THerfore I saye vnto thee veryly (like  as all Gods Prophets and Holy∣ones haue also witnessed:) God dwelleth not in Tabernacles or Temples Act. 7.17. . that are made with Mens Handes. but in the Worke of his owne Hande. For looke into the matter: 16. Wherin hath God {reversed ;}I pray thee; euer had a Pleasure to dwell {reversed ;}for to be aswell vppon Earth as in Heauen; Leuit 26 Pro. 8. d. 2. Cor. 6 b Apo. 21. a but in the Man, whom He himself hath made? And to what Temple or Tabernacle hath He had a Lust to haue it cleansed from the Idoles· and from all vngod∣ly Beeing, but to the Man / wherby to be God and the Lorde alone / in him. 17. Consider: Are not these the Esa. 4. a 6 61. b 62. a 2. Pet 3. b. Apo. 21. .. Promyses / that God wil inhabite the Earth {reversed ;}or the Man of the Earth; in Righteousnes? 18. Yea, euen in the Man / wil Hee {reversed ;}through his gracious Woord and Seruice of Loue; distinct and deuid-a sunder / the Earthly / from the Heauenly / To thend that euenso in the Mans Inwardnes / Thatt which is of God / may com to Eccle. 12.  God / in the heauenly Beeing. and the Earthly / to his earthly Beeing: And He himself ؛the God of Heauen{punctel} Esa. 60. . c Apo. 2. . wil in this
sort haue his Dwelling  in the Mans In∣wardnes / with his godly Beeing, and shyne in him euerlastingly with his Cleernes / as a Day-light from Heauen, and euenso lighten the Earth with Righteousnes. And thatt is the Newe Heauen Esa. 65.66 b 2 Pet. 3. b. Apo. 21. a and the Newe Earth / in which the Righteousnes dwelleth: and they are now coming to all Beleeuers of Christ / which do submitt them obediently vnder the Loue and her Seruice / to the Cleansing from their Sinnes, according to the Pro∣myses. The XI. Chap. THou wrytest moreouer boldly vnto me / that thou hast no God whom thou needest still to feare yt He shoulde vse Rygorousnes with thee: neither doest thou also {reversed ;}as thou wrytest; desyre to haue any such Lorde. 2. I knowe not wel what I shall saye heer∣vpon: but my Conceaueing is / that thou vn∣derstandest not rightly the Feare of God, nor-yet his Rygorousnes, nor his Kyndnes. 3. For / to feare God / Psal. 111. b. Pro. 1. a. 9. b Eccli. 1. b is a costly Treasure / because that therout springeth the holy Wis∣dom. For the Feare of God Pro. 16. a Eccli. 7. c dryueth-out the Sinne. 4. She is a Worke full of all Vertue / a Fore∣sightfulnes / to a good Protection from the Destruction: and begetteth in the Man / a
good Vnderstanding / to a Guyding-in of him to the vpright Lyfe. 5. But to knowe and to loue God in his god∣ly  Nature and Beeing / Sap. 15. a thatt is perfect Righ∣teousnes: and this Perfection in the Loue / 1 Iohn. 4. b dryueth-out Feare: wherthrough the Man doth euenso then / fulfill the Requyring of the Lawe of Moses and of the Fayth of Iesu Christ, and loueth God with all his Heart, and all Men as himself. 6. Therfore ther-is likewyse no Feare of God anymore needfull to such a Man / which hath inherited the Perfection in the Loue. For God dwelleth in him: and thesame Gods Spi∣rit Iohn. 16. b. leadeth him into all Trueth: and declareth all things vnto him. 7. The Man now being a Dwelling for God / in all his Inwardnes 1. Cor. 3.6 b 2 Cor. 6. b. {reversed ;}in whom / God with his Christ and Spirit / liueth and work∣eth; he hath no cause to be afrayde of God nor of his Rygorousnes: For Col. 3 b the Loue is the Bande of their Vnitee. namely, the Godhead with the Manhod. Therfore also the Man needeth not to feare: For all his Nature, Bee∣ing, and Disposition / is like vnto God him∣self / who suffereth his Math. 5. d. Sunne of Righteousnes to shyne ouer Good and Badd. 8. And if now it be so with thee likewyse, then hast thou wonne the Crowne 4. Esd 2. c. Iam 1. a. Apo. 2. b. of Lyfe: and all Ignorance is swallowed-vp in thee. 9. But now it appeereth by thy Woords {reversed ;}ac∣cording to the sounde of thy wryting; that thou
art not yet com heerunto. For thou desyrest yet Releasment from thy former Ignorance: and wishest that it had his Going-vnder in thee: or that it were quyt out of thee, that thou moughtest then reioyce thee aright. 10. Thou Beloued, looke once rightly into thyself: and let thy Bosting be accordingly. For consider: So long as the Man beholdeth his Ignorance and his Enemyes / which do raigne ouer him besydes God and his Doc∣trine or Requyring / so is it meete doutles / that the Man shoulde feare God· inclyne vnto Him and his Requyring· and submitt him obedient∣ly vnder the Ministration of his gracious Woord and Seruice of Loue / to thend that God may be his Headd Psa 27 47. a 96. a b 97. a 99. a. and King· and his Protecter and Helper / against his Enemyes: and that his Enemyes mought euenso {reversed ;}tho∣rough the Power of his God; go-vnder, or com-to-nothing: and that Math. 25. d. God only mought {reversed ;}with his Wisdom or Vnderstanding; heare the Dominion in him, or obtayne thesame against them. The XII. Chap. FArdermore / thou sayest {reversed ;}by thy wryting; that thou must yet suffer thy Brother Esau, seing he is still to-mighty for thee. 2. I knowe not whether I do well vnder∣stande thy Mynde in this Matter / or no / be∣cause
that thou hast heer-to-fore written so franckly vnto me / of thy Deliuerance and Freedom. And yet now thou wrytest of the Power of Esau / ouer thee: and that thou must yet suffer him / seing he is to-mighty for thee. 3. Ah {reversed ;}Beloued; looke rightly into the mat∣ter I pray thee / whether the Procreation of Esau and Iacob / be also com-to-pas with thee / according to the Trueth. For I saye vn∣to thee veryly: With whomsoeuer Esau and Iacob are brought-foorth out of Isaac / the Sede of Promyse / thear cannot Esau doo anything against Iacob: For Iacob is much-to-prudent for him. 4. Howbeit, whear Esau and Iacob are not brought-foorth / thear are they not present likewyse: and the Man also is vtterly vnac∣quaynted with the Vnderstanding therof. For-that-cause ther is likewyse no Power vsed with him / neither by Esau nor-yet by Iacob: but they are all vayne Things / whatsoeuer he per∣swadeth himself to knowe or to feele therof. 5. For both these [namely, Esau and Ia∣cob] are of one Father, Gen. 25. . and of one Moo∣ther: and are also conceaued both at-once in their Moothers Wombe. But the Birth {reversed ;}wherin they make-manifest themselues, and seperate themselues asunder; cometh-to-pas / the One before the Other: of the which now Esau hath the Fore-going, and after-that / Iacob / who is made Gen. 27. . a Lorde ouer Esau, and
an Heyre in the Promyses of his Fathers. Therfore consider now of the Vnderstanding touching Esau and Iacob: 6. Must not Esau eare the Yoke of Iacob▪ and not Iacob / the Yoke of Esau? 7. Hath not Esau also the Promyse {reversed ;}to com-to-pas at his tyme; Gen. 27. c. that he shall lay-off the Yoke of his Brother, and shake it from his Nerk? Esau hath not deceaued or begyled Ia∣cob. but Iacob / Esau.Gen. 25· d. 27. d. And so are the Pro∣myses of God established on Iacob / who is likewyse named Gen. 32. . Israel: and he became a Lorde ouer Esau, who was also named Edom. 8. Therfore is Esau likewyse / figured-foorth or figuratiuely resembled vnto vs / 4. Esd. 6. b. for the first or fore-going Worlde / in like-manerRom. 5. b. Adam also. and Iacob / for thatt which is to-com / and so likewyse / Christ. 9. Because now this Secreat is great / ther∣fore heare a cleere Similitude, wherwith the Birth of Esau and Iacob is vttered-foorth. 10. IN ye Begining / God created Gen. 1. Heauen and Earth at-once: but when the Heauen and the Earth were seperated a-sun∣der / then went the Heauen / aboue the Earth. And then did God sett a great Light and Cleernes / in the Heauen: and it was also hang∣ed with Clowdes, Deawe, and Rayne / wher∣through Hee {reversed ;}to the Welfare of the Earth; garnished the Earth, and made it fruitfull / to bring-foorth all good Fruits.
11. Thatsame now which hath the Fore∣going with the Man / out of the Begetting of the Seede of Promyse, and is first seene / thatt is a naturall Bodye: but thatt which is to Com, or thatt which is last seene / is a spiri∣tuall Bodye: Yet out of one Conception or Begetting. 12. For if we haue out of God / 1. Cor. 15. .a naturall Bodye / then haue we likewyse out of Him / a spirituall Bodye: But the Naturall / which hath the Fore-going to thatt which the Seede of Promyse requyreth / is the Image of ye Spi∣rituall, or of the seconde Generation according to the Spirit, which accomplisheth the Requyr∣ing of the Seede of Promyse. 13. If wee now / haue euenso likewyse / borne the Image of the earthly or naturall Man / 1. Cor. 15. . then shall we also veryly / beare the right Image of the heauenly or spirituall Man. 14. Gather-out the Mynde, and compre∣hende Vnderstanding: The fore-going King∣dom / is the Image of the Beawty and Loue∣lynes of Thatt which is to com. 15. Thatt which goeth before / hath procur∣ed to itself / the Death or the Mortalitee: it  shoulde also haue remayned deadly or mortall / if Thatt which is following / had not {reversed ;}to a Safemaking; appeered ouer it. 16. In which true Beeing / the Death with her Destruction / passeth-away: wherin then likewyse / her Death or Mortalitee / is losened or rent, and her Destruction / swallowed-vpp /
euen-as the Prophet Ozeas hath forespoken thesame: Oze. 13. b. O Death, I was thy Death: O Hell, I was thy Sting. Wherof also Paul hath sayde: When 1. Rom. 15 f the Corruptible / shall put-on the Incorruptible, and the Mortall / the Immortalitee / Then is the fore-mencioned Woord fulfilled: as that the Death is swal∣lowed-vpp in Victory. O Death / whear is now thy Sting, or thy deadly Worke? O Hell / whear is now thy Victory? For the Esa. 25 a. Death is swallowed-vpp by the Lyfe: wher-through / the Hell loseth her Victory. 17. Euenthus is likewyse the Enimitee risen-vp in Esau: but swallowed-vpp by Iacob. by Adam is the Death com into the Worlde: Rom. 5. b 1. Cor. 15. b but by Christ / the Lyfe, to the Conquering of the Death. 18. In the first Creation or Generation / the Earth was waste and empty, and it was darke vppon the Deepe. Gen. 1. and after ye God sayd: Let it be Light, and it was Light. And God be∣healde the Light for Good: And by thesame Light / the Garnishing and the Beawty of the Kingdom was seene, to a gloryous Name of the almighty God, who hath prepared him all thesame. The XIII. Chap. EArdermore thou sayest: Oh (think I somtymes▪) how earnestly is the lost Sheepe of the Howse of Israel sought-for! Notwithstanding, of the
Meaning therof (as thou wrytest) thou know∣est not whether thou hast a right Discerning / or no. And therfore thou desyrest of mee that I would wryte somwhat vnto thee of that Matter / according to my Discerning. 2. O Thou Beloued, the Secret of this Matter is very great / according to my Discerning. Neuertheles / I wil {reversed ;}accord∣ing to thy Request; disclose a little vnto thee of my Sight touching the Meaning therof: For I cannot hyde it from thee. Haue thou a regard on the Meaning: 3. The Howse of Israel / is the Stock of Ia∣cob: which Iacob / is the Second Kingdom of the former Beawty, which surmounteth all Power and Glory. Beholde and consider of thatt which is rehearsed before of Supra. 1. Adam and Christ, of the Earthly and Heauenly, and of Esau and Iacob. So marke then: 4. When now Esau and Iacob were borne, and a little growen-vpp together in Vnder∣standing / then did Iacob▪ ouercom Esau {reversed ;}his Brother; with Prudence and with Deceipt:Gen. 27. c. d and so with Prudence / he gott the Kingdom of Promyse, and became an Elder and a Fa∣ther in the Couenant of the God of his Fa∣thers / Isaac and Abraham. 5. Heerin he also deceaued Isaac his Father / through the Counsayle of Rebecca his Moo∣ther: Gen. 27 a. b and so is becom an Heyre in the Pro∣myses of his Fathers. Therfore he is rightly called Iacob: Gen. 27. d. which Name sig∣nifyeth
vnto vs / A Deceauer, or a Sup∣presser. 6. Now when Iacob was becom a Lorde ouer his Brother Esau: and had receaued the Blessing of the Promyses of his Fathers / Then did he not only loue the Inheritance of the Promyses: but much-more the God of his Fathers. And God Mal. 1. a. Rom. 9. b had likewyse a Pleasure in Iacob. Which God of his Fathers / ap∣peered also vnto him, and hath sealed or esta∣blished the Promyses vppon Iacob: so Gen. 28. b. c that Iacob sawe nothing-els vppon the Place / but the Howse of God. 7. After-that / Iacob wrestled Gen. 32. c. with God: and leaft Him not (although the Daye came-on) before He had blessed him: and so he ouer∣came God likewyse / to his Will. 8. Now when Iacob was com to such Pow∣er and Lordshipp with God / God asked him his Name. He answered God, and sayde / that he was called Iacob. But God gaue him the Name / that he shoulde be called Israel / Gen 32. c. Be∣cause that he had strouen with God and Man, and kept the Victory. And Israel signifyeth vnto vs / A Gods Lorder, or One that lordeth with God, or preuayleth. 9. According to this-very Name, hath God also named his owne Name. For like as God named himself after the Name of Abraham and Isaac / his Fathers, euenso did He likewyse name himself a God of Israel: that is / a God of those that lorde or preuayle with God / vnder
whom Esau standeth seruiceably submitted, and yet is no Heyre in the Testaments of God. 10. Beholde, Thissame / which is the second Birth or Procreation after Esau, and which {reversed ;}in his Ouercoming; is by God / named Israel, is veryly the true and right Howse of Israel. And all that be borne ther-out / are the Lambes and Sheepe of the Howse of Israel. 11. Veryly, thesame Sheepe that is lost or strayed from this Howse (vnderstande the Meaning rightly) is the SheepeMath. 10. . 18. b. Luk. 15. a. that is sought with earnest Loue / to thend that the Promyses that are made to the Fathers / shoulde be esta∣blished on thesame. For God wil also be a God and Sheapheard of ye lost strayed Sheepe of the Howse of Israel: and bringing thesame agayne to his Esa. 56. a Eze. 37. c. Iohn. 10. b Folde / He wil likewyse be a God and a Sheapheard vnto his Seede / euen for euermore. 12. And if thou now hast rightly vnderstood  thissame / then looke-vpon the whole Genera∣tion of Iuda, and the Remnant of the People of Iacob. and how that thosesame, together with the Generations of Men (inasmuch as they are estrainged from their right Stock: namely, from the Fellow-lording with God) are the right lost or erring Sheepe of the Howse o Israel. Then agayne, looke-vpon the Tes∣tament Esa. 4.41. &c. Ier 30.31.32 33. Eze. 34.35.36.37. of Promyse / that is promysed to the Howse of Israel and to the Howse of Iuda: and how God hath sworne vnto them / that
Hee is their Heritage: also Deut. 4. c 32. a Psal. 28.47 a how that they all / are Gods Heritage. 13. Beholde {reversed ;}thou Beloued; Thesesame / Israel and Iuda that are heere rehearsed vnto thee / are the right Heyres and Act. 3. c. Children of the Testament in the Promyses of their Fathers, wherin God wil establish them / in the last Tyme. 14. To which Heritage {reversed ;}according to the Promyses; the Heathen are {reversed ;}by Gods Grace; sa. 42. a 49. . . 1 d. Iohn. 8 b. Act 13. c called and bidden / To thend that they {reversed ;}as Fellow-heyres of the Howse of Israel; shoulde liue and raigne with Israel, and Israels God / in the true Circumcision / which God hath fet or ordayned betwixt Him and Abraham and his Seede / Gen. 17. a for an euerlasting Couenant, and that-ther shoulde be nomore but one God. namely, among the Iewes and Heathen. 15. Beholde, this Grace is chaunced to the Heathen: howbeit / not as those that are borne of the Howse of Israel: but that are called ther∣to by Gods Grace / because that the Heathen shoulde euenso {reversed ;}by Gods Grace / out of the Be∣leefe in Iesus Christ; be likewyse the Seede of Abraham / in Righteousnes and Holynes Luk. 1. phe. 4. c. that pleaseth God, and shoulde possesse the Ci∣tizenshipp in Ierusalem / according to the Promyses. 16. Lo, heer-vnto is the Man {reversed ;}which is so wholly lost or estrainged from this Dominion with God or Howse of Israel; sought and call∣ed with earnest Loue / for that he shoulde com
to the Heritage of God and Christ, which is the Health and Saluation of his Soule, as also liue with God, and that the God of Israel / shoulde likewyse be his God. 17. Consider now / thou Beloued: Heer-vp∣pon (as I haue rehearsed vnto thee) standeth my Sight / touching the lost Sheepe of the Howse of Isarel / that is sought with great Dilligence / by the Lorde and his Ministers / for to bring him Math. 10. a. 1 b. Lu. 15 a. Iohn. 10 b. agayne to his right Sheepe∣folde. The XIIII. Chap. MOreouer, thou wrytest vnto me /  how that thou hadst wel hoped that the whole Worlde shoulde once be cleansed from all her Blyndnes and Ignorance: so that the Song Allelu-ia / mought {reversed ;}with Ioye; be soung heere generally. 2. Thatsame is still all my Hope and Long∣ing: but the Esa. 65. b. 2 Pet. 3 b. Cleansing of the Worlde, and the Reioycing Apo. 19 a of the godly Men / cometh not to pas according to Mans Good-thinking: but according to the Lords Woord and his Pro∣myses / namely / through the Crosse of Christ, wherthrough the Man {reversed ;}in the Cleansing of his Sinnes; becometh altogether humbled and abased· and begotten Iohn.  a. Rom. a. Tit. 3. a agayne or a-newe / out of thesame Death of the Crosse· and made alyue Rom. 5.. a. 1. Cor. 15. c. in Christ. 3. For like as the Golde is purifyed in the
Furnace of the Golde-smith, or thorowly-tryed to fyne Golde / Sap. 3. a. Eccli 2. a. so is the Man likewyse cleansed in the Furnace of the Humiliation of the Crosse of Christ. 4. Out of which Humiliation / the Man com∣eth to the Obedience of God and Christ, of whom he learneth the Humilitee Math. 11. d. and Meeknes of Heart. 5. In which Humilitee and Meeknes of Heart / the Man is blessed and anoynted with the Oyle of Loue: That is, with the holy Gost / in all Goodnes and Louelynes. 6. Beholde, this goeth first ouer the Hows∣holde of God, who in their Cleansing from the Sinne / do Rom. 6. b. 1. Pet. 2. follow-after Christ / in his Death of the Crosse / vnder the Obedience of the Loue: and after-that {reversed ;}in their Makeing-alyue in Iesu Christ; cometh the Ende 1. Cor. 15. c. ouer the Worlde. For so hath it pleased God / to cleanse the Worlde Ephe. 2. b. Col. . c through the Crosse, and to saue the Man, according to the Scripture. 7. Whosoeuer now therfore taketh Math. 16. c. Luk. 14. c. his Crosse vppon him / in the Obedience to the gra∣cious Woord and his Requyring: also {reversed ;}in the Beleefe; followeth-after Christ ؛the Godly∣nes{punctel} vnder the Obedience of the Loue: and so learneth the Humilitee, and the Vertue to the Math. 11. c. Meeknes / Hee likewyse ouercometh the Worlde: and the Saluation cometh vnto him with Ioye. 8. And a Man that is altogether cleansed from the Worlde and from all vnprofitable
and corruptible Things [namely, by the Bap∣tisme Rom. 6. . Col. 2. b. in the Death of Christ, which is the right Fount Tit 3. b. of Regeneration] hee singeth in his right tyme {reversed ;}according to the Trueh; that Tob. 13. . Song / Allelu-ia: Which signifyeth vnto vs / Laude the Lorde. 9. Beholde, thatsame (as I haue heere re∣hearsed vnto thee) is my Sight / touching the Cleansing of the Worlde, and the Reioyceing of the Righteous / in the last tyme. But how∣soeuer the Lorde appoynteth it / let it so content vs in any-wyse. The XV. Chap. ACcording to thy Request {reversed ;}thou Be∣loued;  I haue heere {reversed ;}as in breef-ma∣ner; written a little vnto thee / how my Mynde standeth, or how I am mynded. 2. I knowe not also any Light Iohn. 1. . of Lyfe / but the 2. Cor. 4. . Col. 1. b. Heb. 1. . inuisible true Beeing / the gloryous and louely Lyfe of the liueing Godhead: wher-vp∣pon likewyse my Hope standeth, euen-as wee haue also talked therof in tymes-past. 3. I seeke not likewyse neither haue sought (since that tyme forth / that we spake last to∣gether) any Saluation of the Soule / in any Outward-thing: but {reversed ;}through the Beleefe in Iesu Christ, and through the Loue and her Seruice; I withdrawe my Mynde from all
what is outward, and which is drawing me to Corruption. 4. Heer-vnto doth my Soule bende itself / so much as I may in the Lorde: and I do loue the inuisible Beeing of God / to thend that my inward Mynde should in nowyse stand bounde to the vayne Creatednes: but that my Spirit mought euenso / liue in the Spirit of the true and liueing Beeing. namely / according to the Nature of Christ, Iohn. 13. d. 15. b 1. Iohn. 3. c. who directeth or poynt∣eth vs vnto the Loue ؛the vnchaingable God∣head{punctel}. 5. But thatt Seruice which hath his Mini∣tration to thesame Loue / for the Saluations sake of Men, and requyreth all Orderlynes and Reasonablenes / wil I not dispise, nor-yet in any-case forsake: but wil {reversed ;}so much as the Lorde enableth me therto; further, mayntayne, and minister thesame to the Saluation of Men / inasmuch as the Lorde hath chosen Mee ther-vnto. 6. Oh / that God woulde graunt / that the Seruice of Loue mought flourish without Hinderance; and that euenso the right Vnder∣standing of the Wisdom mought com-to-light / vnder the Obedience of the Loue! For to the louely Lyfe in the Loue / Gen 1.2. Sap. 1. b. 2. c is the Man created, like as is witnessed and administred out of the Seruice of Loue: and therfore is also my Soule inclyned to thesame Seruice / to thend that Ephe. 4. . the Vnite of Heart mought be in ye Loue / among all Louers of the Trueth.
7. Beholde, yet at this present / thus stand∣eth my Mynde: and I likewyse knowe not yet any better, neither haue I also mett with any better. 8. BVt it seemeth now {reversed ;}by thy Wryt∣ing; as though thou hast heard by Somme / that I shoulde be outwardly mynd∣ed (as are Somme whom thou namest vnto mee) O No / thou Beloued: My Heart, Mynde, and Being standeth not grounded vppon any outward Thing / neither do I also desyre to cleaue-vnto and to vse anything that is Outward / which leadeth-away Rom. 1. . Heb. 3. b. from the liueing God and his Righteousnes. 9. But though I now {reversed ;}for the Vnitees sake in the Loue; shoulde conuersate myself with Somme that were yet outwardly mynded, or did yet sett their Confidence vppon any Flesh / yet doth not their weake Grounde concerne mee. But I haue for-that-cause / a lyke-loue towards them / when they cannot attayne vn∣to the inuisible Trueth any farder, and desyre to haue Conuersation peaceably with Mee / and yet for-al-that I do not contemne the Outward. 10. I woulde also willingly leaue them free  in their weake Grounde / if I mought by-that-meanes / conuersate myself in the Vnitee of the Loue / with those that are zealous to the good Beeing, or that are Louers of Vertue, of Wis∣dom, and of Vnderstanding: let them be then / whosoeuer or of what Grounde of Fayth and
Opinion soeuer they bee: if the Loue Col 3. b. were our Bande and Concord· and that we conuersated ourselues with each-other therin: as also woulde willingly heare one-another / through Loue: and that-ther were in-that-sort a good Incly∣nation to the Trueth / among vs all / Then shoulde the right Vnderstanding com-to-light nodout, and the vayne Vnderstanding, toge∣ther with all euell Imaginations and Blas∣pheamings, vanish-away of themselues or con∣sume to nothing. 11. For, to deale in the Loue / with such as are adioyned to the Loue / were more accept∣able vnto mee, also much-more delytfull and ioyfull / then with those that haue no Lust▪ Will, nor Desyre to the good Beeing of the Loue, and wil in-that-maner conuersate them∣selues with mee. 12. For though anyone of the goodwilling Hearts / shoulde {reversed ;}by reason of his small Vnder∣standing; trust yet vpon som Outward-thing yet if he haue a Lust to God and his Righte∣ousnes, and is no Blaspheamer nor Contem∣ner towards another / then cometh thatt Va∣nitee to an Ende doutles / in the Vnderstand∣ing. Therfore men ought not to contemne anyone for the outward Seruices or Ordinan∣ces cause. 13. For it is much better, and much-more acceptable before God / to loue the good Bee∣ing / through som Outward-thing / then to cleaue vnto the Worlde or to the vayne and vn∣profitable
Things / through the Affection to the Worldly outward Things: the Eccli. 15. b. Rom. 1. c Ephe. 4. c. which nodout is altogether strainge from God and his Trueth. and therfore likewyse ther-are Many now / which dispyse the outward Ser∣uices or Ordinances· speaking much Reproche of euery-one· also blaspheaming and with Falshod defameing the Ministers therof: but in that they bynde their Hearts vnto their owne Creatures, or vnto som other outward Things / thatt wil they not once consider. 14. And thesame Estrainging from God and his Trueth {reversed ;}through the Affection to the worldly and outward Things; do we now {reversed ;}alas; fynde among many Men / who do also very franckly bost themselues / that they are not snared by any Man, nor with out∣ward Seruices or Ceremonyes: and so do per∣swade themselues / that therfore they are not outwardly mynded Gal. 4. a. Col 2. c. like those that seeke Righ∣teousnes in outward Things. 15. Yeas assuredly: and yet much-more and worse: For they suffer themselues to be cap∣tiued Rom 1. c. Ephe. 2. a 4. c. with the earthly Things of this Worlde: and {reversed ;}their Hearts growing vayne therthrough, and turning-away themselues from the Lust to the Guyding into the Righ∣teousnes; they hang their Vnderstanding and Mynde on thosesame, and on their owne Good-thinking: so that they for-that-cause / do vt∣terly lose all Lust or Zeale to the vpright Bee∣ing of God, and becom cleaueing to the earth∣ly
corruptible Things; and euenso do quyt cor∣rupt their Vnderstanding. 16. Seing then that they are corrupted in their Vnderstanding / therfore seeke they like∣wyse {reversed ;}according to their owne Pleasures; to liue to the corruptible Things / for a Recrea∣tion of their Hearts: and in no-wyse desyre to be leadd into the true Lyfe / through Gods Ordinance. For the godly Things are as deadd vnto them. and the Seruices of the holy Woord, and to shewe Obedience therin {reversed ;}wher∣with the Man is assisted to the godly Know∣ledg; are as though they had no Signifycation: which thing I commend not. 17. For my Heart hath much-more Affec∣tion to those that with Ignorance / do seeke God and his Righteousnes, and that shewe Obedience therin / then to those that with Vn∣derstanding / do estrainge them from God and his Seruice, and are strainge and disobe∣dient vnto all Righteousnes / according to the Requyring of the holy Woord of the holy Spirit and Seruice of Loue, and so do liue after ther owne Mynde Ier 7. c. 23. b. 18. b and Good-thinking. The XVI. Chap. FOr this cause / my Beloued {reversed ;}as is before sayde; and for that I do now fynde Many / which {reversed ;}according to their owne Good-thinking; do liue
in all Disobedience / against the Requyring of the holy Woord, and which bost them falsly of the Vnderstanding of the spirituall and hea∣uenly Things: and so {reversed ;}leaueing-vnto or loue∣ing the Worlde and the corruptible Things· or the Following of the false Libertynes; de∣syre to conuersate or to haue fellowshipp with mee: and for more such-like things cause, and for that I do neither seeke nor desyre any such matter / I haue indeuoured myself to be con∣uersant with certen zealous Hearts: To thend that I in my Zeale / mought not haue my Course with the Vnwillingones {reversed ;}which take-on a false Freedom / to seperate themselues from the Requyring of the Seruice of Loue, and cleaue to the earthly corruptible Things; but with the Good-willingones to the Righ∣teousnes: and that the Vnderstanding of the godly Trueth and of the peaceable Loue / mought {reversed ;}by that Meanes; beare-swaye a∣mong the Louers of the vpright Vnderstand∣ing / which do loue the Treasures of Wis∣dom, and the Obedience to the Requyring of the Seruice of Loue / aboue Golde and Siluer, Po. 8. . Sap. 7 a. and aboue all what is in the Worlde. 2. For whosoeuer loueth the Wisdom or  the holy Vnderstanding, and the Obedience to the Requyring of her Seruice of Loue / aboue all earthly Things / and doth not con∣temne, enuye, nor blaspheame anyone / that also laboureth ther-after with Ignorance / To him Pro. 8 . Sap. 6 b. 7.  Math. 7. . wil likewyse the Wisdom or holy
Vnderstanding / appeere: But whos loueth anything aboue the Wisdom / or whoso con∣temneth and blaspheameth anyman / in his Zeale to the Righteousnes, and seperateth himself from him / is not wyse: neither shall hee also fynde, vnderstande, nor inherite the Wisdom. For the Wisdom is much-to-noble, to-honorable of Lynage, Pro. 8. a. b. Sap 7 a. b. Eccl. 24. b. and to-precious / for to ioyne or shewe herself vnto those / yt do not loue her with all their Hearts / aboue all Things. 3. Oh {reversed ;}alas; I fynde too-feawe of those which loue the Wisdom aboue all things. But let it go how it will / with the Wysdom and the vpright Righteousnes, the Man doth in-any-case take good heede to the earthly Things / which doutles are nomore to be es∣teemed then as Phil. 3. b. Dirt / in comparyson to the Preciousnes or Worthynes of the Wisdom and Righteousnes of God. 4. Vnderstande now {reversed ;}thou Beloued; wher∣fore I haue indeuoured myself to haue my Conuersation in Freedom / with those whom thou wel knowest, and also with others more. namely, for the Wisdom and the Righ∣teousnes sake, as is before rehearsed, and as I wil yet partly rehearse vnto thee / because that thy Heart shoulde in-nowyse doubt that I haue sought or liked anything-els / but the Vertues of the vpright and true inui∣sible Beeing.
5. For in all Things and Dealings that I  haue has with them / this hath bin all my Grounde and Intent / for to heare-ouer their Vnderstanding and Wisdom / vnder the Obe∣dience of the Loue· to question with them· and to answere agayne / To thend that we mought therby becom agreeable, or concord∣able 1 or. 1. a Phil. 2. a. mynded / in the Loue and in the Vnder∣standing, and to the vpright Righteousnes / and that we shoulde not take or construe anything of each-other / to the worst: but I haue not yet vsed thesame Course among them, nor-yet the Speeche that tendeth ther∣unto. 6. I haue not yet lykewyse bin in any Com∣munialtee among them / wherby to deale boldly with them: But the Lorde do with vs according to his Will, and thatt which serueth most vnto Peace, and to the Vnitee of Heart in the Loue. 7. O Thou Beloued / Although I haue {reversed ;}out of Loue; submitted myself heerunto among Somme, wherby to informe the Louers of the Trueth / to all Vnitee in the Loue, and so haue not contemned nor blas∣pheamed the Outward / Yet am I not ther∣fore outwardly mynded: but this do I veryly acknowledg, that it is much-more Pleasure vnto mee / to deale with the Loue of the Wis∣dom, and to talke therof / among those that loue the Loue and the Wisdom / because that the Righteousnes appeereth vnto Such; then
to inherit all the Ritches and Pleasures of this Worlde: or to deale among those which loue the earthly Things or their owne Good-thinking / aboue the Wisdom, and aboue the Vnitee of Heart in the Loue / and so to dis∣semble with Men / as though all were in∣ward and heauenly Things that they loue / wher-with they deceaue both themselues and other moe / which heare them, and do seduce them from the true Seruices that leade to the Lyfe. 8. And like-as thou wrytest / that it is vnpossible for thee to cause thyne Eyes and thy Heart to hope / as to waight for Deliuer∣ance through any outward Things: euen∣so is thesame likewyse vnpossible for mee. Yea, although it were so that I woulde do it / yet coulde I not. For the Light of the heauenly Trueth {reversed ;}wherwith God hath illu∣minated 1. Cor. 4 a. my Heart / out of his holy Heauen; is an Against-shyning vnto mee / against thesame. But the Ministration of the Good / by the godded Men or Olde-fathers in the Famyly of Loue / is awayes very profit∣able, and a good Preparation to the Deli∣uering of the Man from his Rom. 7. c Bandes of the Sinne. and that men haue familyer bro∣therly Conuersation together to that ende / is also very louely, and likewyse great∣ly edyfying to the Vnitee of Heart in the Loue.
9. Beholde {reversed ;}thou Beloued; like-as I haue heere written vnto thee in naked and bare maner / Euenso standeth my Mynde: and I hope not to forsake thesame / till I haue founde or gotten all what I seek-for, and desyre a∣mong the Louers of the Trueth. The Lorde graunt me Mercy: and doo∣with mee / according to his Will. Amen. Fare-well: and behaue thyself vp∣rightly. Heere-with I do thee heartly greete, In the Lyfe of the Loue most-sweete. The Ende of the Sixt Epistle.
Our Heart / is the Minde of God most-hie. Our Beeing amiable / as the sweete Lillie. Our Faithfulnes / Loue / and Trueth vpright▪ Is Gods Light / Life / and Cleernes bright.

The First Chapter. OUt of the Incly∣nation of the Loue / I HN do wish a good Peace and Saluation / vn∣to the Communialtee of Saincts of the Howse of the Loue of Iesu Christ, and vnto all good-willing Hearts / that for the Glory of Gods sake / do submit them obedient∣ly vnder the Loue, and mayntayne her Ser∣uice / to Esa. 65. b 2.

Mar. 16. b. in ye Worlde / by ye Christ of God / for a Gospel of the Kingdom, and as is written therof / may now in the last tyme / be fulfilled Luk. 18. d. or accomplished / through ye Loue, according to the Promyses. 2. Happy are all those Esa. 25.30. b that long after the∣same, and {reversed ;}for the Glory of God and his Loues sake; do Math. 10. d. 16. Mar. 8. d.

Cor. 15. c. and so be all in all: and no Flesh to account anything 1. Cor. 1. d. of itself anymore.
3. FOrasmuch then as 1. Cor. 25. . 1. Tim 1 b. Mercy is chaunced  vnto Mee {reversed ;}out of Grace; through the Loue of God the Father: and that the God of Lyfe hath permitted the Light of his Cleer∣nes to shyne in my 2. Cor. 4. b.

For to that ende is the Seruice of the Woord vnder the Obedience of the Loue / com-foorth Ephe. 1. b. {reversed ;}to the Laude and Prayse of the godly Glory; for to defende the supreame God in his Honour {reversed ;}because that all thatt which belongeth vnto Him / may be gee∣uen agayne vnto Him, and be drawen vnder Him; and not to excuse any Flesh of Sinne therin, nor-yet {reversed ;}for any Loue of the Fleshes cause; to couer any Flesh / in his Shame: but to discouer thesame naked and bare. namely / all his Whordom, Ier 5. b 7. b 8 14. b 23 c. 1. Tim. 1. b. Adultery, Theeuery, and Killing or Murdering, together with all his false Witnessings, and Esa. 1. a 5. c. 52. a. Mar. 3. Blaspheamy against God and all Gods Holyones. 4. For thus sayth the holy Spirit of Loue, whose Daye Esa. 66. b. Mal. 4 a. burneth like a Cresset-of-flame∣ing-fyer against all his Enemyes: Looke vp∣on yourselues, and consider of your Vnchasti∣tee, and of the Vncleannes and Eze. 24. b. Math. 15.23. . Wickednes of your Hearts, and what yee all are by Na∣ture / O all thou Flesh that art borne of Adam.
Wherwithal {reversed ;}I pray you; or by what Kynde of Righteousnes, or Vnderstanding of Wis∣dom / wil ye iudg the vpright Wisdom or the holy Spirit of Loue, and accuse his Mini∣sters? And wherwith {reversed ;}I pray you; wil ye ex∣cuse or defende yourselues / that ye shoulde not all {reversed ;}how prudent-wyse soeuer ye bee; com to Shame before the Iudgment-seate of the Christ of my God? which Daye of his Iudg∣ment / doth now breake-thorow, and his Coming approcheth Math. 24. c. like a Morning-starr out of the East or Rysing-of-the-sunne: and is seene like ye Lightening / into ye West or Going-downe therof: Whose Lighting / maketh-ma∣nifest all Flesh of the Darknes {reversed ;}in his Vn∣cleannes; through the Coming of his Beawty∣ful-cleernes. The II. Chap. O All thou Flesh of the falne Adam, wherin wilt thou now excuse Rom. 2. thyself before the righteous Iudg, as to be vngilty in anything / wherin thou condemnest another? Therfore beholde and consider: The Iudgment of God in his Ius∣tice / is sett before thee, and thy Sinne or Of∣fence / made naked and bare before thyne Eyes / how that thou art faulty and wrong in euery∣thing: not only in thatt which is manifestly euell or wrong: Esa. 64. c. Math. 23. a. b Rom. 10. a 1. Cor. 1. b. c Col. 2. b.  but also in all thy Wisdom, Holynes, and Righteousnes.
2. Therfore com ye all foorth hether / before the cleere Iudgment or Daye Math. 25 d. Rom. 14 b. 2. Cor. 5. b. of the Sentence of God: make-manifest yourselues eueryone / before his Maiestee, and let your inward Na∣kednes appeere: But what auayleth it, ther shall none be Psal. 14.53 a Rom 3. a founde cleae / No not One righ∣teous. but all / full of Spotts and Wrinckles. 3. Seing then that all of you {reversed ;}which are borne of the sinful Flesh of Adam; are Psal 51. a. vn∣cleane and vnrighteous, and haue nothing-at-all in your Members / that is like vnto the Beawty of the Bryde of Christ / So doth-ther not then likewyse any Iudgment belong vnto you, neither-yet to giue Sentence of the godly Things. Or-els do ye think to sitt vp∣pon the Seate of the Iustice of God / with your Iniustice, and so to pronounce-foorth the Iudgment? Or do ye still think / that yee can iudg right in any Matters? Veryly / I vtter∣ly deny it: for all sinful Flesh in his Vanitee / is false Psal 116. b. Rom. 3. a. and lying. Therfore it belongeth not to him / to iudg anything: but to be iudged him∣self / by the Iudgment of God / to thend that the Vnrighteous / may receaue the Iudgment of their Vnrighteousnes. Math. 13.25. d Rom. 2. a 2 Tess. 1 a. and the Righteous / the Iudgment of their Righteousnes / Because that it may euenso be witnessed / that God only Psal 116. b Iohn. 3 d. Rom. 3. a. Apo 19. a b. is righteous in his Iudgment. 4. Thus sayth the holy Spirit of Loue: I  haue to deale with thee / O all thou Flesh / that art borne of the falne Adam▪ and likewyse with you all that wil excuse or defende that∣same.
For this is the righteous Iudgment of my God / ouer you: that ye all are Rom. 2. a. resistant against the Kyndnes of the highest God. Who wil now I pray you / iustify or excuse himself against thesame. For according to your owne inclyned Mynde / ye haue all doutles fleshed yourselues with the Deuill: and so are incor∣porated to all Euell and Wickednes: wher∣through ye haue eueryone {reversed ;}how prudent-wyse soeuer ye be; Apo. 17. b. fought against God and the Lambe / with your owne Wisdom or Good-thinking. and o haue troden-downe the Loue∣ing-kyndnes of God in yourselues / with Feete· shedd the Blood of the Righteous· and accounted the holy Blood of the true Testa∣ment of the Lorde Iesu Christ / for Heb. 10. f. vncleane: shutt ye Glory of God quyt out of your Hearts: and so are becom replenished Math. 23. c with all Vnrigh∣teousnes, Wickednes, Maliciousnes, Mock∣ing, and Blaspheamy. 5.

Beholde, This false Iudgment proceed∣ing  out of the Wisdom of the Flesh, and out of the crafty and wicked Sight / is com before the Eares of the supreame God: Gen. 6. a. and thesame hath greeued Him. For-that-cause hath He now in the last tyme {reversed ;}or in this Oldnes of the tyme; taken the righteous Iudgment vnto himself / against all lying Flesh, Psal. 96.98. a. for to iudg with Righteousnes vppon the Earth: namely, vnto the Good / to a Reward of all Good: Rom. 2. a. but vnto the Euell / to a Reward of all Euell and Wickednes.

Com and let yourselues be seene in the Light: But what auayleth it / ye shall all now be made-manifest before thesame Iudgment / what ye are. For all your Nakednes {reversed ;}although ye think to couer yourselues; becometh theare layd-bare: and ye cannot also with all your owne Power / Psal. 76.130. Mala. 3. a. Apo. 6. b byde-standing against the ver∣tuous Nature of the Loue. 2. Beholde, such a Glistering of Cleernes hath the Loue in her Beawty and Righteous∣nes / that no Vncleaneone can {reversed ;}with Ioye; endure with her nor with her Comunialtee. For his Wickednes or Craftynes is manifest ther-against, euen-like as it doth also appeere with Many now in this present Daye. Ther∣fore hath likewyse no Flesh of the falne Adam / any pleasure therin: Wherby it is knowen and manifest / Esa. 40. a 1. Pet. 1. c. how vayne all Flesh of Adam is / in all his Knowledg, Sight, and Wisdom. 3. Who wil now I pray you / defende the sin∣full Flesh any longer / to a Couering of his crafty Nature? Who wil▪ I saye; excuse it / in his Subtil-wylynes? For ther dwelleth Gen. 6 a 8. c Ier. 17. b. Math 15.23 b Rom. 7. c no Good-thing in it: but nodout / all Hypocrisie and Deceit.
4. Truly / it shall not be excused / before the  Spirit of Lyfe, neither-yet can men also ex∣cuse thesame before Mee / wherby I shoulde alow it in any Thing (let it then appeere as good or holy as it will): but that it is Rom. 3. d. false and lying / in euery-poynt, and can witnes no Trueth / of any godly Things. 5. Seing now that the Deceit of the sinfull Flesh, with all his Inclynacion according to his owne Sensualitee / is {reversed ;}euen in Experience by the Deede and Trueth; becom knowe vnto Mee / through the Light / So cannot I like∣wyse for-that-cause / trust any Flesh of Sinne, neither-yet beleeue nor alow any Iudgment Deut. 1. b. Iohn. 7. c 8. b that it iudgeth according to the Sight of his owne Eyes, or according to the Hearing of his owne Eares: but am altogether against the∣same, as that it is wrong in all his Iudg∣ments that are according to the Sight of the Eyes, or Hearing of the Eares / and iudgeth Gods Trueth falsly and out of the Lye: and I do also testifye against all Iudgment of the sinfull Flesh / that it vseth all his Industry and Prudence / Phil. 2. c. to the preferment of his Selfnes, and euenso iudgeth to his Self-seeking· 6. Beholde / so false, lying, and deceitfull· and so full of Dissimulation and Hypocrisie / it is in all his Dooing and Leaueing. Not only in that {reversed ;}which hath an euell showe: but cheefly in thatt wherwith it wil showe itself {reversed ;}with a Shyne of holy Speeches; to be holy and vp∣right, and wherin it wilbe alowed.
7. To conclude, ther is nothing but Psal. 14. a. 58. a. 116. b. Rom. 3. a. b. Lyes and Falshod / in all Flesh of the falne Adam, and in all what is borne out of the sinfull Flesh, and that hath no Lust to performe the Re∣quyring of the gracious Woord of the Lorde: and whatsoeuer it witnesseth, affirmeth, or speaketh / is all to the Couering of his Crafty∣nes, and false Selfnes: let it iustifye or cleere itself then / somuch as it will: let it transforme his Countenance to be so woful-hearted / as it will: let it sobb, let it sigh or lament then / so∣much as it will: let it speake then so sweete or flatteringly / as it will: let it testify then his Sight and Hearing / so perfectly as it will: let it also be then so vnderstanding or skilfull / touch∣ing ye new Birth· the Loue· the Trueth· and ye Secretnes of God or of the heauenly Things / as it will {reversed ;}if it be not obediently mynded to the Requyring of the gracious Woord and his Seruice; So is it doutles all false, and nothing but Poyson that it speweth-foorth against the vpright Lyfe of the Soule / wherby to Iohn. 10. a. kill and to spoyle the Peace of the Soule, Rom. 16. b. and to rende ye Concord of the Goodwillingones tow∣wards the Loue. The IIII. Chap. THerfore / O ye young Children / which are borne out of the Seruice of Loue and out of her Spirit / to the God of Lyfe / to the Lande of his
Glory / together with ye Disciples and on-coming Men / in the holy Vnderstanding of the gracious Woord of the Lorde / Beware of all sinfull and lying Flesh of Adam, and of all Myndes that take-part with thesame, Rom. . . Gal.   Col . . or which do excuse, defende, or alow thesame in his Vanitee and Falshod / To thend that ye do not committ Whordom therwith, nor-yet becom spoyled of the Peace / which ye do inhe∣rit vnder the Obedience of the Loue. 2. For all sinfull Flesh / dealeth in Couered∣nes and Craftynes / with his Lyes and De∣ceit: and those that cleaue-vnto thesame, and defende or excuse it for anything that is Vp∣right / Act. 7. f. are all Traytors and Imaginers-of-euell towards the vpright vncorrupt Good / which cometh-forth or is witnessed out of the Loue / to an Vnitee of Heart / in the Loue. 3. Therfore be mistrustfull towards all sin∣full  Flesh / as also towards all vnregenerated Men / which turne them away from the Obe∣dience to the Requyring of the Seruice of Loue / beleeue not the Very-best of them / much-lesse / those whom ye knowe to turne-away them∣selues from vs and our Doctrine vnder the Obedience of the Loue,1. Iohn 2. . and to stand-vpp against the Loue and her Seruice, and to vse their Hypocrisie / towards the Comunial∣tee of Saincts in the Loue. For no Flesh that is borne of the falne Adam; Psal. 143. a▪ Rom. 3  shalbe ounde righteous / when it is iudged according to the Trueth.
4. For-that-cause let noman com-before mee with any Mynde of the Flesh, for to excuse the sinfull Flesh / how lamentable or wofull soeuer it maketh itself, or how holy and vnderstand∣ing soeuer it appeereth. 5. Oh, let noman tell me any good or vertue / of the lying Flesh, nor-yet of the vnregenerat∣ed Man / which seperateth himself from the Loue and her Seruice: but let eueryone take-heede in the Spirit / to the true spirituall Iohn. 3. b. Birth of the Children of God, which cometh out of Heauen / to the Beleeuers of the holy Woord of the Spirit of Loue / vnder the Obedience of the Loue: which spirituall heauenly Children of God / are full of all Goodnes and Vertue· and of-one-mynde with Vs / to all Concorde in the Seruice of Loue. 6. Therfore Math. 24. c. Mark. 13. c. Luk. 17. c. beleeue no Men of the Earth / which com vnto you out of yt Flesh and Blood of Sinne, and are without the Famyly of Loue: but beleeue the Men of God / which com vnto you out of the Seruice of Loue, and which descend-doune to you Iohn 1.3. d. 2. Pet. 1. b. 1. Iohn. 1. a. from Heauen / who / are Spirit and Lyfe, and haue had their Rest in the Bosom of the Almighty Father / till vnto this last Tyme. And from thence do they {reversed ;}in the Obedience of the Loue; com agayne now with their God / in Glory, Esa. 3. b. Iude. 1. b for to bring the Iudgment {reversed ;}with Righteousnes; ouer the Worlde. 7. Beholde, thatsame Iohn. 12. d. Iudgment is now kept against all sinfull Flesh. For Hee which
iudgeth righteously / hath sett himself vppon his gloryous Iudgment-seate: Math. 24. d, 25. d. 2. Tess. 1. a. Iude. 1. b And all his Saincts com with Him / in great multytudes of Hosts, for to possesse the Earth with Righ∣teousnes. For it is geeuen vnto them Math. 11. c. 28 b Lu. 10. d. Iohn . d by that God / who hath made it all. 8. For the Prayer Apo. 6. b of the Saincts is now  hearde, and their God cometh to take Venge∣ance / to a Righteousnes Psa 96.98 a Apo. 19. a vppon the Earth, euen-as is written therof / because that the Will of God the Father / may be don vppon Math. 6.26. c. the Earth likeas it is in Heauen, and that his vpright Beeing with his Saincts / may also beare-swaye thear· the Scripture Math. 26. f. Luk. 24. ebecom ful∣filled· and that God may bee all 1. Cor. 15. , in all, ac∣cording to the Promyses. 9. Beholde, Thatt is Gods Glory, and the righteous Iudgment of my God. Who wil open his Mouth / to speake against thesame? lest he com to shame / in his Tongue. 10. Therfore shut-too your Mouth / with a Bitt, Psal. 39. a. Luk. 3. a. that ye fall not through your Tongue: but Esa. 30. b. in Stilnes / take-heede vnto God, who appeereth and cometh Iude. 1. b. on the Earth with all his Saincts / in great Glory, euen-as is writ∣ten therof. The V. Chap. WHat hath God to doo with you, or what careth Hee for your Wayl∣ing and Lamenting / O ye flattering Tongues, or all yee that wil excuse
or defende the Flesh of Sinne? For beholde, the Lorde shall in thissame Light of the Loue / shame you all in Psal. 5 a Math. 25. d. his Beholding: and his mighty Hande of Iustice / shall stand ouer you / to a Suppressing of you / till that ye be con∣founded, and remayne confounded for euer∣more. 2. True it is, I haue heard a mighty Crye with a great Lamentation and Waylling / vp∣pon the Earth / wher-through / I was al∣most mooued to Compassion. But I went a∣little neerer to that Howling and Lamenting. And lo / when I considered theron, It was the Flesh of Sinne / that wayled and lament∣ed excedingly / Apo. 18. b because that his Worthynes mought be nomore of Value, and for that it was nomore esteemed, nor coulde gett any Prayse or Honour anymore, and that God with his Saincts / did only gett the Glory. 3. But when I vnderstood the Lamenting and Wayling / then was I not mooued to Compassion ouer ye lamenting Flesh of Sinne / as to fauour or defende thesame / in his sinfull Lusts and vnchast Desyres. For it was mynded against God / in all his Lamenting and Wayling: but my Heart was compassion∣ably-bent with the Godhead. For looking-vpon the Falshod and Deceipt of the sinfull Flesh / I hoped to reioyce me in Gods Glory: and so myne Affection stood-bent with the God of Lyfe / to thend that his Glory mought breake-thorow / ouer the Darknesses of Men.
And I coulde not bemoue the Generation of the euel-willing Men / in their Howling and Weeping, because they did not repent. For all their Howling and Weeping was / because they mought nomore vse their Vnrighteousnes and their Pleasure of Whordom and Theeuery / according to their owne Will. And to leaue thesame / was their Payne and Greef which they suffered. 4. Beholde, thatt is the Reward of the Vn∣godly / wherin they now at the last / be punish∣ed, according to the Woord of our Lord and God. For all Vngodlyons shalbe punished Sap. 11.12. . Apo. 18.  in their owne Wickednes / wherin they haue liued / according to their owne Lusts. 5. Do ye Vnderstand this well / O ye La∣menters and Defenders of the Sinful-flesh? Ye do lament the Flesh greatly / in his Wayl∣ing, because it fayleth him in his Will or Lusts: but ye do not aboue-al / lament the Goodnes of God, which hath bin forced to suffer from the begining Apo. 15. a of the Worlde / for the Resistan∣ces cause of the sinfull Flesh. 6. O Ye foolish Lamenters, yee which saye  to the Flesh, and to those which {reversed ;}ac∣cording to ye Flesh; seeke nothing Phil 2. , but their Self∣nes: Oh, how are ye burdened against your owne Myndes and Vnderstandings / and what a matter haue ye to beare, to endure or to suffer! Oh, ye cannot do it: and it goeth altogether euell with you doutles / because ye may not vse your Sensualitee and your Lusts /
in Freedom: Ah, cast from you all Burden∣ings / that com vppon you against the Flesh / as also the Seruice of Loue / which is against you in all your Myndes of the Flesh: and take not thosame Burdenings on you: but take-heede to the Sap. 2. . Lusts of your Flesh, and leade your Lyfe according to the maner of the Worlde / for your Peaces cause, and so liue in Freedom / concordablely. 7. Beholde, such things do the Enemyes Phil. 3. b. of the true Crosse of Christ speake: wherwith they shewe how well they are contented that the Man shoulde liue in a false Freedom and in a false Concord: and that Christ ؛the Goodnes of God the Father{punctel} shoulde still suf∣fer, Rom 6. a.

Yet do these Lamenters of the Flesh not∣withstanding / talke likewyse somtymes / of the Suffering or Crosse of Christ / euenas the Knowledg prefigureth thesame vnto them: but to follow-after Christ obediently therin, and to be partakers Rom. 6. a Phil. 3. b. of his Resurrection in themselues / to a new Lyfe of their Mynde / thatt do they forsake / because they seeke their

And whosoeuer is in the Loue, and standeth submitted to her Seruice / to shewe Obedience / in him ther-is no Euell, Wickednes, nor Craftynes. 4. But if anyman do imagine any Wicked∣nes  or Euell therof: and that the Wickednes doth euenso gett place in his Heart / against the Loue and her Seruice / Hee veryly is an Adul∣terer,Math. 5. . and committeth Adultry with the Euell, against the pure Wedlock of the vpright Loue. 5.

And thatsame is likewyse the Cause / why the secret Bread of the holy Woord / doth not oftentymes serue for eueryones Stomack. 10. For one may fynde many Men / for  whom it is much more profitable and better at-the-first / to receaue good Medecine out of the holy Woord / for their vnsounde Sto∣macks cause, then any strong Meate / to thend that their Stomacks mought be cleansed therby· and accustomed vnto Bread agayne. 11. Whosoeuer then is com alittle vnto Health, and is yet but weake and tender / to him ther serueth nothing-els at the first / but to receaue Hony 1. Cor. 3. a Heb. . b. 1. Pet. 1. a and Milke / out of the holy Woord, to a Sustayning of him in his Weaknes. For he cannot as-yet endure strong Meate. 12. But when Strength cometh vnto him, and that he can beare the Weaknes of his Neighbour / so doth. it then serue him very-well / to receaue of the ecet Bread of the holy Woord / for a Foode of the strong Lyfe / that he may yet growe stronger· and haue the Iohn. 10. a. Lyfe in Fulnes: and that nothing may hurt Mr. 16. b Luk. 10.  nor lett him for to liue.
The II. Chap. THis wryte I vnto thee {reversed ;}my Be∣loued; because thou shouldest not stum∣ble or growe-offended at our Littlenes or Childishnes, nor at the Seeming of our Foolishnes / in the Ministration of the holy Woord, nor-yet at our mostholy Ser∣uice of Loue / because it is 1. Cor. 1. b.  playne· and not ac∣cording to the Course of the Wisdom of this Worlde· nor of the Scripture-learned. 2. Notwithstanding, although our Seruice of Loue be playne / yet is it vnto vs / a godly Seruice in the Woord of Lyfe. Which Ser∣uice / wee {reversed ;}out of Courtesie 2. Cor. 4. a. Tit. 3. a and a good Con∣science; do minister in the Woord of Lyfe ▪vnder the Obedience of the Loue; to euery∣ones Welfare and Health of his Soule. name∣ly, 1. Cor▪ 1. b. c vnto all and ouer all those that beleeue theron. 3. For truly, in all this our mostholy Ser∣uice of Loue / we do not follow-after the Wye of the Worlde / in their Wisdom, nor-yet the high-bosting Scripture-learned / in their Knowledg, nor any Chosen-spiritualtee / in their Holynes, nor any taken-on God-ser∣uices / in their Controuersie: but we witnes the Wisdom that auayleth before God, which seemeth to be a 1. Cor. . b Foolishnes before their Eyes / and do make-manifest the vpright Righteous∣nes and Holynes which God esteemeth: which
seemeth before the Eyes of the Worlde, and before all her Hipocrits, fayned Holyons, and Scripture-learned / to be Esa. 15.  Sp. 2. b. 5.  nothing but Sinne, Vnrighteousnes, or Seduceing. 4. For in all thissame / all Hipocrites, fayned  Holyons, and Wyse or Scripture-learned ones of the Worlde / haue {reversed ;}through the Be∣witching of their Hearts; accounted the Dark∣nes / Esa 5 c. 5.  59. b for Light, and the Light / for Dark∣nes / and grounded all thier Vnderstanding / vppon their Knowledg / in the Darknes: and so haue intangled themselues in many-maner of Prudencies / through their owne Know∣ledg: and brought the whole Worlde euery∣wheare / into so many erring Blyndnesses: in-such-sort, that for-that-aue / all Vnder∣standing of Men / hath corrupted Gen. 6.  his Waye, euen-like as all Flesh did / in the tyme of Noe. Therfore is also their Destruction com hard-by. 5. And seing now that we haue founde-out in the Deede and Trueth / that all manly Vn∣derstanding hath corrupted his Waye in the Knowledg / So do we likewyse {reversed ;}through the Light of the eternall Trueth; beholde a great Wo and Greefe among Many: Ez 7. b Luk 19..  the which is coming euerywhear ouer the Children of Men. And thatt is the great Destruction ouer the manly Generacion / in the Last tyme. 6. For the Destruction hath taken-holde of them, and shall make-vp itself to a Destruction
among them, and fall vppon them all speede∣ly. namely, because that their noble Vnder∣standing / hath forsaken Det. 32.  the liueing Beeing of God· and intangled itself with so many-kyndes of ignorant Knowledg or Good-think∣ing: so that the Children of Men haue ther∣through / plucked I 23. f. g a heauy Burden vppon their owne Necks / to their Destruction. Which Burden also / they shall not be able to beare nor accomplish; but must perish therin. 7. Heerwithal goeth the Man burthened, combered, and greeued / and cannot fynde theMath. 11. d Refreshing of his Soule / in the Knowledg of his corrupt Vnderstanding, although he not∣withstanding seeketh it therin. He thinketh to fynde the Lyfe / in the Knowledg of his cor∣rupt Vnderstanding: but thesame Knowledg / Gen 3. a is nothing-els but to a Death and Condem∣nation vnto him. But the Lyfe in the Loue / is the Saluation and Peace. 8. Seing now that the Worlde standeth com∣prehended 1. Iohn. 5. c. in the Destruction of the ignorant Knowledg: the which she doth neither see nor marke / so is therfore the Affection of our Heart / ouer all thoe and vnto all those / which do see or knowe the Destruction ouer them∣selues, and which desyre our Seruice / to the∣obtayning of a godly Knowledg / wherby to be partakers 2. Pet▪ 1.  of the godly Beeing of the Loue: and which seeke their Preseruation with vs / in the Loue. 9. For vnto those afflicted Hearts / do we
shewe our Seruice 2. Cor. . ▪ Tit. 3. a courteously / witnessing vnto them / the Passage to the Lyfe: Wher∣with we do meete or com-before them with a good Conscience, against their corrupt Vnder∣standing or euell Conscience: and so do reache∣out the Hande vnto them / to a Guyding of them into our Comunialtee of Loue and of the good Vnderstanding / To thend that they mought therby / be drawen out of the dam∣nabl Esa 47.  Apo 1. b Plagues of the vnbeleeueing and insen∣sible Worlde· and to an Health in their Soules / wherby to serue and to liue-vnto our Luk. 1. g God {reversed ;}with Them; concordably / vnder the Obedi∣ence of the Loue {reversed ;}with a cleane or vndefyled Conscience; in all Loue / as being free or vn∣bounde from all Diuisions or Schysmes, and vnbewitched from all chosen and coun∣terfeyt God-seruices and false Holynesses. The III. Chap. BEholde {reversed ;}my Beloued; this haue  I written for the Answering of thy Letter / as meeting with thee, and giueing thee to vnderstande therwith∣al / how erring-blynde the Children of Men are growne in these last Tymes. Not only the Worlde / that liueth in Wyldnes and in Bruit∣ish-sort: but cheefly / those that haue chosen them som God-seruices, Righteousnesses, and Holynesses / through the Knowledg of their wne corrupt Vnderstanding, or haue coun∣terfeited
them according to the Prefiguration of the Letter: wherthrough Many of them haue made vnto themselues / a wicked and naughty Conscience, by the which / they suffer themselues to be iudged / out of the Darknes: and so do Isa. 2. a Ir. . b feare and serue those Gods which they themselues haue made. 2. And although they be somtymes rebuked by their euell and darke Conscience / yet be not the Darknesses made-manifest in them for-al-that, neither becom they also any Light: For they cannot / because that their euell and darke Conscience (although it be esteemed for Light and Trueth) is Darknes and Lyes itself. Therfore it is a certayne Testiony / that such a Conscience is vntrue / and doth neither iudg right, nor rebuke to Amendment. 3. But God Iohn. 1. a. 5. c. 14. a which is the Light and Lyfe itself / is much greater 1. Iohn. 3. c in Power / then the darke Conscience. For He himself / doth {reversed ;}tho∣rough his Light and Seruice of Loue; seper∣ate in vs / the Light / 2. Cor. 4. a from the Darknesses, and so Iohn. 17 c. sainctifyeth his Name / in vs: and sheweth that He himself / is the Lorde and the right 2. Tim. 4. b A▪ 10. f and true Iudg / in our Consciences. 4. Therfore shoulde not the Man take any Iudgment vpon him / out of his darke Vn∣derstanding or euell Conscience, although the euell Conscience wil seeme to execute the Iudg∣ment / out of the Darknesses: But alwayes to long after som better thing, and to sett the Comfort of his Hope Rom. 15. a. vppon thatt which
God hath promysed. namely, vppon the Light of Lyfe / administred in the Seruice of Loue / for that he mought euen so by the God of Lyfe {reversed ;}Ephe. 1. a whose Hand-worke he is; be accept∣ed and receaued in the Seruice of Loue / to a Nourtering with Righteousnes: and so mought {reversed ;}to his Saluation; take-heede to the Rebuke and to the nourterable Information / mini∣stred by the Light. namely, through the Ser∣uice of the holy Woord / vnder the Obedience of the Loue. For in that sort doth God rebuke and Pro. 3. b Heb. 12. a nourter euery Sonne / whom He accept∣eth or receaueth. 5. Whatsoeuer then is so rebuked by the Iohn. 3. c Ephe 5. b Light, thatt is manifest: and whatsoeuer is manifest, thatt is Light: and we vnderstande or knowe / that the Rebuke by the Day-light of the Righteousnes of God / is very profit∣able and good for vs / to Amendment and to Saluation. 6. For God Deut 32. d 1. Reg. 2. a Sap. 16 b Tob. 13 a killeth, and maketh alyue a∣gayne / because He woulde euenso by his Kill∣ing / depryue the 1 Cor. 15. f 2. Timo 1. b Heb. 2 b Death of her Power. 7. He leadeth into Hell, 1. Reg. 2. a Tob. 1.  and leadeth ther∣out agayne / because He woulde euenso / rende the Kingdom of Hell· and depryue the Hell of her Victory: shewing that Hee only is the Lorde, and hath the Power ouer the Death and Hell. 8. Beholde, thatt is the Iudgment of the Righteousnes of God, and the Coming of the Lorde Iesu Christ / to our Preseruation, and
to the Saluation of vs / which hope vpon God and Christ / for that the Death and the Hell / shoulde nomore haue any Dominion ouer vs: but that the Lorde only / mought {reversed ;}as our God and King; raigne ouer vs· and wee {reversed ;}as his People; to serue Him Luk. 1. g in Righteousnes and Holynes / to his Prayse and Glory, and to our Ioye. 9. Whersoeuer then / God doth {reversed ;}through his Light and Seruice of Loue; execute the Iudg∣ment [namely, as a Death to the Death / Oze. 13. b . Cor. 15. f and as a Sting to the Hell / to a Conquering both of the Death and of the Hell] euen-theare is put-on the Incorruption / the Lyfe of the euerlasting Immortalitee / to thend that the Scripture shoulde be fulfilled in the Woord of Lyfe / which God hath spoken in tymes-past by Ozeas / his holy Prophet: O Oze· 13. b 1. Cor 15. f Death, I was thy Death. O Hell, I was thy Sting. 10. Heerin haue we to prayse our God, for that Hee {reversed ;}through his Light and Seruice of Loue; prepareth vs the Victory against the Death and Hell. For those are 1. Cor. 15 a the last Ene∣myes of the Lyfe / from the which / God wil cleanse vs / according to his Promyses. 11. For the Daye or Light of the Lorde / in his Seruice of Loue and righteous Iudgmēt / is like vnto the Gold-smithes Furnace, and like the Sope of a Laundresse. Beholde, the Furnace of the Gold-smith / Mal. 3. a purifyeth the Golde in the Fyre. The Sope of a Laundresse /
cleanseth the Clothes in the Water. Euenso is the Man cleansed also in the Pro. 17.27. . Sap. 3. a Eccli. 2.  Furnace of Hu∣miliation / in the Daye or Light of the Lorde. 12. NOw this passed-ouer. I reioyce me  for thy Thankes, for yt thou {reversed ;}as thou wrytest; art not a-little taught and informed / by the little Booke that we haue sent vnto thee. Of the which thou wrytest-ouer vnto mee / that thou vnderstandest som of the Sentences which thou hast read therin. 13. But {reversed ;}my Beloued; learne to haue a con∣sideration / betwixt a godded and an vngod∣ded Man: and iudg thou accordingly. For in that Place whear a godded Man standeth, in such a State of thesame Beeing / an no vn∣godded Man holde himself, nor-yet be so. And though that he woulde so, or if that anyone shoulde mooue him thertoo, hee did vnwyse∣ly. For an vngodded Man hath no Sub∣stance / wherwith he can stand submitted vn∣to God. He hath Rom. 7. b. the Will I graunt: but ther-is neither the Power nor he Accomplish∣ment / with him. The IIII. Chap. THerfore ought not the Man to  take-on any-thing / neither Submis∣sion, nor Vnsubmission. If he be estrainged in the Absent-beeing from
God, and that he knoweth his Estrainging / yet doth not the Knowledg bring with-it any Submission vnto him / in the Beeing of the Estrainging from his God. 2. Yea, how submitted soeuer he wil seeme to behaue himself / yet is it doutles no Submis∣sion: but an Vnsubmission. For the Longing resteth not / Psa 42· a. for to com to the Beholding of God: and thesame Vnsubmission is vpright and good. And now when the Man is com to the Beeing of his God / by the Obedience to the Seruice of Loue, and knoweth that same in his Beholding / as a Light of Lyfe / Then doth that Beeing / bring-forth the Submission itself. For God is with him, and Psal. 16. b is alwayes in his Beholding. 3. If he be in the Kingdom of Heauen / then is God thear also with him: If he be in the Hell / then is he thear well and safe: For God is Psa. 139. a thear likewyse with him. If he go-about to-and-fro with the Creatures / then is God thear in like-maner with him. And in such an Estate / the Man is euerywhear and in all poynts / submitted vnto his God. 4. For God is alwayes with him Psal. 16. b at his Right-hand: and his euer-liueing Beeing / is also a Light still / in his Beholding: Ther∣fore he feareth not. And euenso in the true Beeing / the Submission is vpright and good. And whosoeuer taketh-on another Submis∣sion, or if that anyman shoulde think to con∣tent himself with another Submission / with∣out
the true Beeing: and so hunteth-after the Submission / he shall not fynde the right Sub∣mission. 5. Wherfore, because that we shoulde not  comfort ourselues with the Vanitee nor with any foolish Submission / the Scripture teach∣eth vs thus: Esa. 55· a. Seeke the Lorde / whylst He is to be founde: Call to Him / whyles He is neer-by. I wil be founde (sayth the Lorde / by the Prophet Ieremy) when ye Ier. 29. b seeke me with all your Hearts. 6. To thesame doth Peter also exhort the Bretheren of Fayth: 2. Pet. 1. b. We haue (sayth he) a sure propheticall Woord, and ye do well that ye haue regarde ther-vnto / as vnto a Light / which shyneth in a darke Corner / till the Daye breake, and the Morning-light ryse-vp in your Hearts. 7. BEholde, These Doctrines, and more such like / do all teache the Vnsubmis∣sion / thewhyles one is yet in the Absent-beeing from God / because that the Longing towards our God {reversed ;}in Longsufferance; shoulde not ceasse. Therfore noman hath the right Sub∣mission, neither is also the Submission pro∣mysed to anyman / in the Estrainging from his God: but only in Gods Beeing / the Light of Lyfe. 8. But thewhyles we do yet walke vppon  the Earth in the Absent-beeing from God / like Geasts 1. Par 29 d Psal. 39 c. 1. Pet. 2. b. Heb. 11. c. and Pilgrimes / so haue we our Comfort {reversed ;}Rom. 15. a in a firme Hope; vpon the Pro∣myses
of God / through his gracious Woord, and do credite God / that He is true in his Woord and Promyses: and do Rom. 8. c Tit. 2. waight euen∣so with Patience / vpon the Coming of the Lorde Iesu Christ. Whose Coming / com∣eth with Light and Cleernes, and with the Fulnes of Lyfe. And so in an assured Hope on the Appeering of Christ {reversed ;}who is coming vnto vs in the Spirit; we haue our Consola∣tion 1. Tess. 4. b. Heb. 10.  with each-other / thewhyles the deadly Things haue yet captiued vs: and so we 1. Cor. 11. c. confesse the Suffering and Death of Christ / for our Sinnes cause. And euenthus through Fayth / we becom armed likewyse with the∣same 1. Pet. 4. a Mynde of the Suffering and Death of Christ, for to be planted into Rom. 6. a Him with the like Death / vnder the Obedience of the Loue. 9. And wee which be in-that-sort planted into Christ / with the like Death / do wayte for Him to com Rom. 8. b Tit. 2. a with a Gloryousnes of Lyfe / ouer the Death / wherby to make vs {reversed ;}which suffer with Him; alyue Rom. 6.8. 2.

And thatt is the Gospel of the King∣dom,
Math. 28. c Mar. 16. b Rom. 10. b. Apo. 14. which is published in all the Worlde / now in the last tyme, according to the Pro∣myses. The V. Chap. FArdermore {reversed ;}my Beloued; thou  wrytest vnto me / that the Hell in pro∣cesse of tyme / vanisheth-away in thee: but the Hauen cometh not agayne in the Place of the Hell. In which state (as thou wrytest) thou canst not well somtymes stand submitted, and yet of-right-it ought to be so, like-as thou perswadest thyself or rememberest / that thou shouldest haue learned and vnder∣stood it so of mee. 2. For which Cause sake / thou makest an hearty Request vnto me {reversed ;}by Wryting; to in∣forme thee therof: and demaundest of me ther∣with, and deyerest an Answer ther-vpon / how I haue behaued myself in the Passing∣ouer or Wading-thorow thesame, for that thou moughtest likewyse follow-after mee. 3. Veryly, I cannot answere thee according to thy Request / how I haue alwayes behaued myself / in the Making-vp of the euell Con∣science and erring Ignorance in the Dark∣nesses. But to shew-forth Heb. 10. c Iam. 5. Patience / in our Affliction, thatt is profitable and good for vs all: and to haue a firme Hope vpon God / in our Tryall or Temptation.
4. For veryly / the Tyme cometh, and is com / that the Iudgments of the euell Con∣science / shall all be seene and knowen / for Darknesses, and not for Light· for Lyes / and not for Trueth. In like-maner / it shall also be seene and knowen / that the Hell Sap. 1 b. and Condemnation {reversed ;}which ryseth out of the vn∣measurable lying Beeing, or maketh-vp itself ther-out; are all Lyes and corruptible. For none of all these euell Things / wherwith the Man is Sap. 11. bpunished in Darknes {reversed ;}for his Sinnes cause; hath God Sap. 1 b. made. Therfore it is all / Death and Lyes / whatsoeuer is not Hee himself, neither-yet that Hee hath made. For all what God hath made / Gen. 1 a. Sap. 1 b Eccli. 40. a is good: and is euerywhitt / Lyfe and Trueth, to the Blessing and Ioye of the Man. 5. But if-o-be now that thou doest not knowe or see all these euell Things {reversed ;}which do tempt or besett the Man; to be Lyes and Darknesses / then art thou yet much-to-weake / for one to talke anything with thee of the Trueth. and as-yet to-ignorant of the Trueth / for to vnderstand anything therof, or to com∣prehende anything of the Light of Lyfe. 6. But seing that these euell Things {reversed ;}which are all Lyes and Darknes; do captiue vs, and bewitch our Hearts: and that we haue ac∣counted of them to be somwhat / therfore haue they brought vs to Suffering and Greefe: and do likewyse seeme vnto vs to be somwhat / so long as we do beleeue the Lyes and Dark∣nesses.
But in this Tribulation and Heauynes {reversed ;}in the tyme of our Temptation; let vs shew∣forth Eccli. 2. . Iam. 5. a Patience / in the Hope of Deliuerance. And thatt is it wherof I haue comoned with thee: But not so playnly as I do now wryte thesame vnto thee. 7. Now for to be altogether deliuered Iohn. . Rom. 7.8. b or  made-free from these euell Thinges / which are risen-vp in thee, and haue captiued thee / for that thy Soule may escape the Perills / into the which she is brought / through thy defyled Conscience / So is-ther nothing more profitable or furdersom for thee to the Lyfe / then that thou shouldest forsake the dark Ob∣iect / vnder whom thyne Vnderstanding hath stoode captiue: the which thou hast beleeued / to the Wounding of thy Soule: and so {reversed ;}giue∣ing thyne Vnderstanding wholly and altoge∣ther 2.

This Wisdom {reversed ;}seing it is of God; Sap. 7· c Iam. 3. b. is also ▪ courteous, and freendly: For it is the true Christ of God, the liueing Woord of the Father, and the euerlasting Lyfe. 4. Beholde, this is the Lyfe that was with God the Father / from the Begining: Gen 1 a. Psal 33. a Pro 8. c Sap. 1. b Iohn. 1. a. tho∣rough the which / God hath made all Things: and without thesame / God hath made no∣thing / that is any-what. 5. This Lyfe Iohn. 1. d. is for a Light of Men / to thend that the Man shoulde liue the Lyfe / that proceedeth Rom. 6. a 1 Pet 4. a out of God. And this Lyfe is in Vs: Iohn 1. a and we are made through thesame, and grounded or sett ther-vppon / as vppon a liueing Woord Esa. 40. b 1. Pet. 1. c that continueth for euer: And to thesame Woord in his Seruice / we be all called and bidden / because that we shoulde euenso through his Seruice / beleeue theron. 6. Thissame was in the Worlde also, Iohn. 1. b Heb. 1. a and the Worlde was made by thesame: but the Worlde knew it not. 7. Thissame Woord or Lyfe / doth likewyse beare euery-thing / Heb 1. a with the Beeing of his Power: and maketh the Ephe. 1. a. Cleansing of our Sinnes / through Himself.
8. Beholde, by thatsame hath Gen. 1.  God made all Things well / in the Begining: and ther was nothing made in the Begining / of all that God had made / but it was all good. And God did also beholde it all for good. 9. And so from the Begining / ther was no  euell nor dmnable Thing / with the Lyfe that is of God: and this Lyfe was vniforme {reversed ;}as one like Beeing; Gen 1. c Sap. 2. c Eccli. 17. a with the Godhead. And in Beholding it / ther was no Difference: For it was in euery-poynt / godded with God: and so in the Begining / ther was no∣thing-els but one God, one Light, and one Lyfe. 10. Out of this Lyfe / did God bring-foorth the Memory or Vnderstanding, Gen. 1. b  to be an Help to the Lyfe / to thend that euery-thing shoulde be handled and gouerned well and or∣derly / by the Memory or Vnderstanding· and by the Lyfe / wher-out God had brought the Memory. Therfore did likewyse the Lyfe / inclyne to the Vnderstanding, and cleaue vnto her: for she was a Light / of his Light, and a Lyfe / of his Lyfe. Therfore was she also the Most-beawtyfull and the Most-delytfulone to the louely Lyfe. 11. Thewhiles that this Vnderstanding / turned-not-out or fel-not-away from the Life: but did alwayes stand-firme in the Lyfe / for Gen. . b  an Help to the Lyfe / so was-ther Ioye and Peace with God and the Man: and ther was no Diuision or Middle-wall / betwixt God
and the Man: neither had the Vnderstanding any other Knowledg / but that she liued to the Lyfe, and stood obedient / to the Seruice and Welfare of the Lyfe, and to the Rest and Peace of all Generations of the Earth. 12. Beholde, this was the former Kingdom of God / full of all pure Beawty / wherin God {reversed ;}before the Man fel-away from Him; was knowen / as a Iohn. 1. b Lorde in his Glory: and the Math. 24. a Act. 1. a Setting-vp of thesame Kingdom agayne / those are the Promyses of God the Father. namely, to establish thesame / through his Loue and her Seruice / in the last tyme. 13. But when the Memory or Vnderstand∣ing turned-away from the Lyfe, taking-vpon-her to knowe somthing / that was not the Lyfe itself, nor that stood grounded in the Lyfe, neither-yet was for an Help vnto the Lyfe / Then did the Vnderstanding mingle herself with thatt which was nothing, or which God had not made: and thatt was the Euell / against the Good, the Lye / agaynst the Trueth, and the Death / against the Lyfe. And thus did the Vnderstanding committ Adultry, and she was inflamed with the know∣ing of somthing without the Lyfe. And she became subiect to the Vanitee or Thatt which was nothing: and then was the Transgression brought-to-pas, and the Sinne was in-that-sort brought-forth / Iohn 6.  17 2.

And now when the Man was estrainged  from the Beholding of his God / then was the Lyfe also / nomore for a Light to the Vn∣derstanding: for the Darknesses had Exo. 10. c Psal 105. c Sap 17. a captiu∣ed her: and ye Lyfe and Trueth was vnknow∣en / by reason of the Darknesses: and so the Death Sap. 2. c Rom. 5. c. gott the Vpper-hande. 16. The Deuill or the Contrary-nature to God / tooke the Vnderstanding captiue in his Bandes: and thus did the Kigdom of Death, of the Deuill, and of Hell / gett his Foorme in the Man / and increased in Preuayling.

But veryly, the Seruices and Ceremonyes of ye Vnchristians and of ye Straingers / which are Rom. 1. c Ephe. 4. . darkened in their Vnderstanding, and estrainged from ye Light of Lyfe (let them then take-on thosame out of their owne Imagina∣tiō, or out of their Knowledg which they frame out of the Letter) all those do we account vn∣profitable and in vayne / Yea, for an harmfull Institution, and for an arrogant Ier. 5. b  a. 14 b. 23 c Presump∣tion against Gods Commaundement.

But if thou bist yet vnsatisfyed in anything, then giue him to vnderstand of the Matter, and aske his resolusion therof. And if thou bist not satisfyed so in thyn Vnderstanding, thē wryte∣ouer the Matter vnto mee. I proffer myself alwayes {reversed ;}out of an Inclynation of Loue; to doo thee Seruice.

For wee are nomore but Iohn. 1. a. witnesses of the true Beeing of the Loue / which we minister vnto you / and 1. Cor. 4. . 2. Cor. 6. a.

MY intyrely beloued Freendes and Bretheren in the Loue of Iesu Christ, Vouchsafe for this tyme / to be con∣tent with this my harty Exhortation and small Seruice: and ensue or performe first-of-al / thatt which is heald-foorth before you Math  a.

Esa. 66. b. of the Milke of our Breasts, and eaten of one Bread with vs. 4. Therfore are wee likewyse dayly carefull ouer you, like vnto a naturall Moother that alwayes beareth a Care ouer her Children / for to prouide thatt with Dilligence / which is needfull for them. 5. If now the naturall Moothers haue such a Care ouer their naturall Children / shall not then the spirituall Moothers / now in these perillous Tymes / beare much-more a godly Care dayly ouer their spirituall Children of Sion / Esa. 66. a. which they beare to the God of Lyfe / for to bring-them-up in all Health and Godly∣nes / to their full Age / vnhindered? Yes no∣dout. For veryly / the spirituall Procreation, and the spirituall or inward Mootherly-loue / doth farr exceede the naturall. It is verytrue. 6. For-that-cause {reversed ;}ye Beloued; inclyne not to the earthly and Rom. 6.12.  corruptible Beeing: but suffer yourselues to be nourished and taught by the Seruice of Loue▪ and through thesame / drawe-away Rom. 13. b Gal. 5. b. 1.

For after the Sounde of the seauen Trum∣pets / the greate Voyces in Heauen became saying: Apo. 12. .

Seing then that many Heartes do com before vs now / with Deceipt (notwithstand∣ing / I hope otherwyse of thee) and that wee by-that-occasion / do not willingly wryte vn∣aduisedly or vnforesightfully vnto anyman that desyereth it of vs / Therfore woulde we gladly at the first / heare to what ende Those that seeke any Seruice at our Handes / do de∣syre our Seruice / 2. Cor. 5. . 1. Tess. . b. which proceedeth out of Gods Counsayle and Wisdom. 6. And besydes thatt / because I coulde not vnderstande thy Mynde or Intent / by the Message that was don vnto me by Mouth / therfore haue I refrayned from wryting vnto thee at that tyme: but did by him returne Mes∣sage vnto thee / by woord-of-mouth / that I woulde com to thee about Sainte Martines-tyde / for to talke with thee myself by Mouth. 7. But because ther is now somwhat-els  com vnto me / which hath hindered me from coming to thee / therfore haue I heere now by this Bearer / written the Cause vnto thee / why I did omitt to wryte vnto thee at that tyme. 8. But I hope that thou wilt not be offend∣ed heerby. nor-yet think / that my Will is ther∣fore to forsake the Seruice of the holy Woord / wherunto the God of Lyfe hath Gal. 1 b. Ephe 1. b 3.  1 Timo. 1. a. elected Mee / through his Loue / for to assist, and to be ser∣uiceable vnto my Neighbour / toward the∣same Loue of God the Father [namely, to the Needy, Esa▪ 58. a. or Poore of Spirit, and to the
Broken or Psalm 34 b 51. b. 147, a Esa. 57. b. Striken of Heart] Or-yet tha I woulde not vouchsafe to wryte vnto thee. 9. O No {reversed ;}thou Beloued; my Heart or Mynde standeth not so bent / as to forsake the Good and his Seruice: or that I shoulde not vouchsafe to serue eueryone ther-with: but I stande alwayes good-willingly bent therto. For I do not serue nor labour for myself only: Eccli. 24. d. 33. c. but likewyse for all Those that loue and desyre Informacion. The II. Chap. HOwbeit {reversed ;}my Beloued; I woulde doutles very-gladly haue spoken with thee by Mouth myself / if the tyme woulde haue serued therto / Because that I haue heard by Somme / that thou art not well content or satisfied with the sincere Wisdom or Vnderstanding / which is com vnto vs Littleones and Lowely-hearts / Sap. 6. b. Iam 3. b. out of Heauen / from the Right-hande of God, and which we do minister vnto the Children of Men / to their Saluacion: but makest many Woordes vpon it / for that thou wouldest iudg the godly Wisdom and holy Vnderstanding / according to thyne owne Imaginacion, and so to withstande thesame / according to thy good-thinking Iudgment: wherwith thou Rom. 16. b. 2 Cor. 11. a. stealest-away the Simplicitee in Christ, as also the true Obedience to the Loue, and to the Requyring of her Seruice / from the Hearts of
the Simple: and {reversed ;}euen in Contempt towards the Trueth of God; gloryest and commendest thyself therin. 2. O thou Beloued, if thou perseuerest heer∣in / then wil it fal-out greeuous vnto the / to withstande the Mouth of God, and the Grace of his Loue / wherwith God presenteth thee and all Men / Luk. 24. c. Rom. 2 a. Act. 17. d. to a Repentance for their Sinnes. 3. Therfore do I exhort thee {reversed ;}out of the boun∣teous  Loue of God; to thy Preseruacion and Saluacion / sett not thyself against the Trueth of God, nor apply not thy Natural-reason and Prudence therunto: but turne thee from the euell Acts of thy Lipps and Toung: and submitt thyself humbly with vs {reversed ;}euen 1. Pet. 5 a. Iam. 4 a. with a simple Heart; vnder the Obedience of the Loue / so shalt thou fynde Grace before God. 4. But if-so-be thou desyrest larger Instruc∣tion of anything / then thse Wrytings which proceede-out from vs / do witnes vnto thee: or if Those that com vnto thee from Vs / do not satisfy thee / in thyne Vndestanding / Yet do not therfore reiect anything: but aske after the right Distinction. And when thou hast in∣quyred after the right Grounde of the Trueth of our godly Testimonyes / then vnderstande likewyse the Mattier first rightly {reversed ;}according to the Trueth; er-euer thou dispise or speak-a∣gainst anything of the holy Testimonyes of the Trueth.
5. If then ther be any Sentence to-secret be∣fore thee: or if thou want anything / then wryte-ouer thesame boldly vnto mee / as one that loueth Eccli 6. d. 8. a. the Informacion, and desyereth the cleere Instruction of the Math 13▪ b. Secretnes of the Trueth. I hope thou shalt alwayes fynde me seruiceable / for to assist thee to the Vnitee in the Loue, and to liue concordably with thee / in the vpright Vnderstanding. 6. If now thou giue thyself heerunto, and doest euenso / then wil I {reversed ;}through the Grace that is shewed on mee; most-groundly instruct thee, and also shewe thee with Sensible-rea∣son / that we haue no want of anything / in our Seruice of Loue: but do / out of the Cleer∣nes of God {reversed ;}2.

Waye or Course that leadeth to the Lfe, wherof thou wil seeme to saye much with Misunderstanding / as being vnexpert in the Matter. 7. But if now it be vnknowen or to-darke before anyman, as that our Gospel {reversed ;}which we publish vnder the Obedience of the Loue / out of the highest Cleernes of God / 2. Cor. 3. b. from the vncouered Face of Christ; be to-couered or to-secret for him / 2 Cor. 4. a Then veryly is it hidden to those / which with the vnbeleeueing Mynde of this Worlde / do not beleeue nor vnder∣stande the Trueth of God: also before all those / which perswade Pro. 3, b. Esa. . c. themselues that they
wyse, and for-that-cause / are not subiect to the sincere Doctrine of the Loue. The III. Chap. FOrasmuch now then / as that the  Seruice of Gods Loue / is {reversed ;}by Gods Grace; com vnto Mee, and comitted Gal. 1. d. 1.

Apo. 21 a wherin God wil dwell, liue, and walke; and the true God-seruice in thesame. namely, for to distinct the Forefrunt of the true Tabernacle of God {reversed ;}wherin the vpright Circumcision cometh-to-pas / which is Ier. 4. a. Rom 2. c. Phil. 3. a. Col. 2. b. according to the Requyring of the Obedience of the Lawe of the Lorde; from the Heathenshipp or Vncircumcision: the Holy {reversed ;}wherein the vpright Baptisme cometh-to-pas / which is Rom. 6. a.

vnto God, and which is profitable to his Saluation. 2. But first-of-al / the Man ought to take-heede what the gracious Seruice of Loue and of the holy and gracious Woord requyreth of him / in his Heathenshipp or Vncircumcision / to his Saluacion: For by thesame Seruice of the gracious Woord in the Vncircumcision / God calleth or requyreth the Man {reversed ;}with his true Promyses of Saluacion, and assured Graunt of eternall Lyfe; out of the Gen. 22. a. Heathen∣shipp or Vncircumcision / to the Good-wil∣lingnes to the Entrance into his Sainctuary: and so then the Man (if he becom good-wil∣ling to the Obeying of the Calling of ye Lorde, and hath a regarde vnto ye gracious 2 Pet. 1. c. Woord) is drawen or leadd out of the Heathenshipp / into the Forefrunt of the true Sainctuary or Tabernacle of God, and to the Departure out of the Sinne, and to the Entrance into the godly Lyfe. And thesame Departure out of the Heathenshipp, and Entrance into the Sainctuary / is the Seruice or the Requyring of the holy Woorde / in the Heathenshipp or Vncircumcision. 3. But the Seruice or the Requyring of the holy Woord / in the Forefrunt or Entrance into the godly Lyfe, is the Rom. 2. c. Phil. 3. a. Col. 2. b. Circumcision of the Heart / in the Feare of God [namely, Col. 2. b. the Laying-away of the Sinne in the Flesh.] Which Forefrunts Entrance {reversed ;}and to shewe Obedience therin / according to the Lawe of
the Lorde; is the right Math. 7. b. Luk. 13. c. Waye and the first Stepp / that leadeth the Man {reversed ;}out of the Heathenshipp; to the Entrance into the Sainc∣tuary of God, and into the godly Lyfe of Christ. And so out of the Forefrunt of the Tabernacle of God and the Seruice of the∣same / the Man is leadd into the true Holy of the Tabernacle of God, or vpright Beleefe of Iesu Christ. 4. The Seruice or the Requyring of the holy Woord in the Holy, or Beleefe of Iesu Christ / is the Putting-on or Iohn. 6. f. Receaueing of the Body of Iesu Chrst, and so to dye vnto the Sinne / 1 Pet. 2. c. 4. a. in the Following of Christ in his Death of the Crosse: and Rom. 6. a.

Forgiuenes and Burying of the Sinne, and to an euerlasting Rom. 5. a. Heb. 9. b. Reconcilment with God the Father. 5. Which vpright Offering and his Fulfil∣ling  in the Following of Christ in the holy: and so to lay-away and to buy the Sinne / through the Death of the Crosse of Christ
(as to be planted into Christ / with the like Death in the Holy, or to be baptised Rom. 6. a. Col. 2. b. in-that-maner / in his Death) the Man oweth vnto God the Father. For thatt is the right Rom. 3. c. Ephe 1. . Heb. 9.6. Forgiuenes of Sinnes, the true Conquering of the Death, the godly Iustifycation, Rom. 8. a Heb. 9.10 b. and the Satisfaction of Christ with the Manhod / through his Suffering and Death of the Crosse: wherthrough the Vayle Math. 27. betwixt the Holy and ye Mostholy / is put-away from the Man. And so he is leadd out of the Holy of the Tabernacle of God, and his Seruice of the true Offering / into the Mostholy of the Taber∣nacle of God, or into ye vpright 1. Cor. 13. b Col. 3. b. Loue of God the Father. namely, into the Perfection or Accomplishment of all the Workes of God, and into the Fulnes of all ye spirituall and hea∣uenly Goodes. 6. But the Seruice or the Requyring of the holy Woord in the Mostholy [namely, in the Loue of God the Father, or Perfection of all the Workes of God] is / to declare the true Resurrection with Christ, and to publish the∣same for a Gospel or ioyfull Message of the Kingdom of God and Christ: and that the euerlasting Lyfe / is to be inherited Eph. 1.2. . Col. 1.2.3. a therin, as also ye spirituall and heauenly Goodes of Christ and of his Father / in the heauenly Beeing. And thatt is the true Seting-vp of the Perfec∣tion, and the Declaring of the Kingdom of the God of Heauens / in his Glory, for a righteous Iudgment of God vppon the Earth.

The Thirtenth Epistle. Loueing Infor∣macions vnto a Louer of the Trueth / which before-tyme was a Blaspheamer of the Seruice of Loue and the Ministers therof: and af∣terward {reversed ;}with great Sorrow for his Sinne; turned him to thesame Seruice / for to shewe Obedience therin.

The First Chapter. FOrasmuch {reversed ;}thou Beloued; as I haue receaued thy Salutaci∣on and Wryting / written vnto mee (wherin thou doest expresse / yt thou hast wholly turned thy self to ye Good / with all thy Sences and Thoughts: and art wel-mynded with Mee / to the Ephe. 4. a. Vnitee of Heart in the Loue, to the Peace, and to the Righteousnes) So haue I indeuoured me with Dilligence of my Heart / for to perceaue to what ende thy Mynde and Intent mought stretch in thissame: or which is the Cheefest-thing that thou seekest or intendest therwith. 2. If-so-be now that I do fynde in the Deede and Trueth / that thy whole Heart, Intent, and Mynde / doth (as thou wrytest) stande-mynded with Mee / to the Loue / that euerlast∣ing and inuisible heauenly Good: Then wil I not also be mistrustfull towards thee, nor-yet conceaue otherwyse of thee / then thou wrytest. but wil hope all good of thee. 3. But forasmuch now as that almost all Flesh of the earthly Manhod is captiued with secret Craftynes / which itself oftentymes seeth not: also / that it seeketh in althings / himself, or his owne Phil. 2. c. Benefite / in what Humiltee and
Holynes soeuer it turneth or giueth-ouer Esa. 58.59.  Col, 2. b. c. itself vnto: and that all his Conuersion is nothing-els oftentymes / but an Inclynation to his owne Sensualitee / according to his owne Plea∣sure / Therfore haue I doutles to consider well theron, and to vse a great Circumspection to the things that the Man giueth-foorth of him∣self: and likewyse for to perceaue out of what Grounde of the Heart / the Mans Conuersion, or his Mynde to the Good / cometh-to-pas, or out of what Intent he calleth Thatt the Good / wherunto he turneth him. namely, whether ye thesame which he turneth him vnto / do Rom. 6. b.  a. 13. b. Gal. 5. b. delyte him according to the Flesh of Sinne, and ac∣cording to his fleshly Will: or whether that he turne-away himself from all what is a De∣lyte vnto the Flesh, and so hath a psal. 40. Desyre with all his Heart / to doo the Lordes Will. 4. For-that-cause {reversed ;}thou Beloued; inasmuch now as all snfull Flesh is generally {reversed ;}in his Conuersion; so Gen 6 ▪ self-chooseing, and is also of∣tentymes / founde deceitfull therin / Therfore cannot I so simply beleeue nor trust thee / at the first / because yt I may yet perhapps haue som Suspicion / whether that thy Conuersion may proceede out of a Rom. 8. a. 13. b. Delyte of the Flesh / or no, and therfore cannot continue stedfast with thee. Notwithstanding / by thy Wryting / I hope the Best of thee. 5. But seing that it is all Pro. 11. b. vnstedfast / what∣soeuer is taken-on out of the Pleasure of the sinfull Flesh / therfore must I needes wryte
vnto thee of thesame, and of my Mistrust that I haue towards it. For doutles I can trust no Flesh of Sinne, nor anything that the Man inclyneth-vnto / according to the Mocions or Pleasures of the Flesh / as to thinck that his Humilitee and Lowelynes or Littlenes / is so wholly inclyned to the Loue of God the Fa∣ther / with an vpright Heart / as his Woordes and Wrytings do import. Also / none of those things can perswade me to trust firmly theron / that it shalbe found euen so in the Deede. 6. Notwithstanding, although I do mistrust the Man / according to the Inclynacion of his Flesh, and do not so simply beleeue him at the first / yet do I wel vouchsafe vnto him with all my Heart / all the Good wherof he bosteth him. Yea, I woulde also that he had obtayn∣ed such Mercy at the hands of the highest God / as his Woordes do speake-of, or as his  Wrytings do import. 7. But veryly, all whatsoeuer is testifyed, enterprysed, or begonne / out of the Will and Pleasure of the Flesh / without the Spirit of God, or without our Mostholy Seruice of Loue. or whatsoeuer is beleeued, accepted, and deuised / out of anymans Doctrine and Counsayle / that standeth not wholly submitted to the holy Spirit of Loue and his Seruice (let it be then in the accomplishing, erecting, or obeying of what Holynes or Righteousnes so∣euer it be) therin shall noman {reversed ;}whosoeuer he be; be able to continue stedfast: but they must all
needes be varyable and com to shame therin. 8. For seing it procedeth out of the Flesh of Lyes / Rom. 7. b. c▪ 8. a. . Cor. 3. a. therfore also is not the Power to the vpright Righteousnes and Holynes / with thesame: but it is only with the highest God: Which God / bringeth or sendeth his Power / Ephe. 3. b. Phil. 2. b. 3. c Col 1. c. vnto his Beleeuers or Holyones / that heare his Woord, and giue-ouer themselues with all their Hearts / vnto Obedience vnder the Spi∣rit of the Loue of Christ, and to the mostholy Godseriuce of thesame. 9. Vnder which vpright Seruice and godly Righteousnes / God doth not fauour any Flesch, as to honour thesame with any fleshly Righteousnes or Holynes / 1 Cor 1. c. for that it shoulde in nowyse bost itself of his owne Goodnes. The II. Chap. SEing then that ther belongeth no  Honour to the Flesh of Sinne / ther∣fore doth God likewyse now in his gloryous Daye of ye Coming of Christ bring all sinfull 1. Cor. 1. c. Flesh to shame {reversed ;}in the Purpose of his owne Holynes or Righteousnes through the Seruice of his Loue; and sheweth that Hee ؛the Lorde{punctel} is the vpright Righteousnes of the true Lyfe, and the Loue itself. Which God / permitteth not himself to be approched vnto nor reconciled / in his Righteousnes (let it be then by what meanes it wil) Psal 5.24 a Esa 33. b. Heb. 12. c. but only by his owne vertuous Beeing, and godly Nature, or Spirit of Loue.
2. But this doth the Flesh dislyke-of: for-that-cause also / it hath no pleasure in the God of Heauen, nor in his Glory, nor-yet in the Iudgment of his Righteousnes. For ther-through it fyndeth itself altogether vayne and weake / before God and his Trueth. also vt∣terly Iob. 9.  b. c Psal. 126. b. Rom. 3. a. vnrighteous, false, and lying / in his owne Iudgment. 3. And the Flesh, or the Wisdom proceding out of the Flesh / doth likewyse growe-offen∣ded at the true Light of God {reversed ;}the which not∣withstanding / is Christ / 1. Iohn. 4. c the Sauiour of all the Worlde himself; because that all his Flesh∣es owne-proper Righteousnes Col. 2. b. c. and self-chosen Holynes and Wisdom / auayleth not with the true Light, neither-yet is it esteemed as to make any account therof. 4. But seing now that the Flesh of Sinne / woulde so fayne haue Prayse or Honour for his Holynes, Wisdom, or Righteousnes / therfore doth it seeke thesame among the Children of Men / in diuers maners. By which occasion / ther is so many Diuisions of chosen Holynes / growne euerywhear Rom. 10. a. Gal. 3 a. 4. b Col. 2. b c. in the Worlde or among the Children of Men. 5. But Gods Saints {reversed ;}which dwell in Hea∣uen; shall laugh the Flesh of Sinne to-scorne / with his foolish Bewitching, and with all the Hipocrisy of his forged Holynes. For the Man hath therthrough forsaken the louely Righte∣ousnes of the vpright Lyfe in the Peace. and {reversed ;}with his owne Righteousnes; plucked much
Stryfe and Controuersy vppon his owne Neck. 6. He hath also lest to giue Ier. 2. . Rom. 1.  to the God of Lyfe his Honour / Iohn. 5.  that belongeth only vnto Him. and hath sought and defended his owne Honour. Therfore hath he likewyse dealt with so many Wickednesses, and Killings or Mur∣derings. By which occasion / he cannot also vnderstande or conceaue any-thing-at-all Math. 23. Rom. 10.  of the vpright Righteousnes which auayleth be∣fore God, which notwithstanding / bringeth-the Loue and the Peace vnto him. 7. Seing then that the Man {reversed ;}in his Igno∣rance;  is thus vtterly Gen. 6. a.  Rom. 1. . Eph. 4. b. corrupted / through the Bewitching of the sinfull Flesh, and hath geeuen a great Respect vnto his owne good-thinking Knowledg / so hath he likewyse turn∣ed all his Dilligence towards thesame / to Rom. 10. a. set-vp his owne Righteousnes / according to the Goodthinking of his Knowledg. and hath generally had a pleasure in his owne Workes. 8. But thatt God which liueth for euer, and is my God / shall now in thissame Daye Math. 24. d 25. d. 26. g. 2. Timo. 1. b {reversed ;}through the Appeering of Christ in his Glo∣ry; bring all Flesh of Sinne 1. Cor 1. c. to shame / in his owne Wisdom and made Holynes. In which Daye of the gloryous Cleernes of God / God wil iudg Psal. 96. b. Act. 17. d. the Circuit of the Earth / with Righ∣teousnes. 9. Therfore shall now likewyse in thissame Daye / all Generacions of the Earth {reversed ;}which sett their Confidence vppon their owne Wis∣dom,
Righteousnes, and Holynes of the sin∣full Flesh; Esa. 13. a. Ioel. 1.2. Sap. 5. a. Lu 21. c Apo. 18. b. chowle and weepe. For Gods Doctrine / serueing to the Entrance into the true christian Lyfe / shall appeere vnto them / to an Offenciuenes· his Righteousnes / to Sinne· his Lyfe / to a Death· and his Salua∣cion / to a Condemnacion. 10. Although I wryte thus vnto thee / thou Beloued: and do not regarde any Flesh of Sinne / in his owne Righteousnes / yet do I account this of great value / that all Flesh with all his earthly Beeing / do lay-downe itself on his right Place [namely, Psal. 110. a. Heb. 1.10. b. to be a Bench for the Lordes Feete] and so submitt itself to the Requyring of the Spirit of the Loue of Christ / to thend that the God of Lyfe may gett the Dominion Esa 24. c. Sap. 3. b. ouer him / with his vpright Righteousnes. 11. I do also wel vouchsafe vnto thee with all my Heart / to haue obtayned all that thou louest / out of the vertuous Nature 1. Cor. 13. of the Loue: and do likewyse hope that thy Heart standeth-mynded / euen according as thou wrytest. Wherby also it shall not be greeuous vnto me / to conceaue the Best of thee: and that thy Wryting proceedeth not out of thyself, nor out of any prudent Counsayle of the Flesh. but out of a Sap 1. a. Ephe. 6. a. Col 3. c. single Heart / through the Mercy of God, wherwith God hath pittied thee / to the Lande of his Glory, and to our Ioye in the Vnitee of Heart / for that we may lyue toge∣ther
in the vpright and louely Beeing of Iesu Christ. 12. But if now it be Flesh, or if it proceede out of the fleshly Beeing / then shall it surely Iob 14. a. chainge and be vnconstant, and vanish-away vnder the Hande: and my Spirit {reversed ;}which is the Lordes; shall not bynde itself vnto the Fleshes Beeing. 13. And if it be Spirit, or if it proceede out of the Beeing of the true Spirit of Loue / then shall it likewyse continue, and remayne con∣stant with thee. and all myne Inclynacion / shall stande affected to thy godly Will. For thatt be farre from me / that my Heart, Mynde, and Soule / shoulde mynde or af∣fect anything-els / but only the spirituall and true heauenly Good, and those that with mee / do loue only the Heauenly, and are godly of will. 14. Therfore also perswade thyself thorowly  {reversed ;}thou Beloued; that my Mynde and all the Inclynacion of my Will (although I do con∣uersate myself with Many outwardly) is in∣clyned only to Those that are wel-mynded to the Spirituall and Heauenly, and are godly of Will: and that my Heart and Spirit desyr∣eth to haue Fellowship with none other / but those that with all their Hearts and Soules / do giue-ouer themselues to all Obedience of the Loue, and so do stande wel-mynded to all Concorde with the Spirit of Loue and our Comunialtee.

For many false Spirits and deceit∣full Knowledges / Math 24 a. 1. Iohn. 4. a 2. Iohn. 1. a. 2. Pet. 2. a. do now go-foorth / for to deceaue all Hearts of Men / that stande mynded on the earthly and fleshly Things. 2. For-that-cause haue a Discerning heerin. For if the Spirit, or the Imaginacion of the Knowledg which is borne or brought-foorth in thee / be spirituall, and that thesame do proceede out of the godly Wisdom of the true Light / Rom. 8. a Gal 5. b. Then wil it veryly be altogether against the Flesh and the Workes of the Flesh. and wil chasten, crucify, and kill the Flesh Rom. 13. b. Gal. 5. c. Col. 3. a. 2 Pet. 2. b. with his Lusts and Desyres. 3. But if the Spirit and Fruit or the Imagi∣nacion of the Knowledg / be fleshly, and that it proceede out of the Wisdom of the Flesh / then wil thesame likewyse make-manifest itself with the Workes of the Flesh / to the Lusts of Er∣rour / Gal. 6. b. that stretch to Destruction: also be vt∣terly 2. Timo. 3. a against the Spirit of Godlynes, and the Counsayle of the Wisdom: and wil likewyse desyre to suppresse and to kill or destroye / all what cometh before her in her Heart and Thoughts / touching the godly Wisdom of the Seruice of Loue.

For to that ende haue we obtayned the mostholy Office or Seruice of Loue: but not from ourselues, nor from Men. but from Gal. 1. b.

Guydes / that yse-vp ther-out with their false Spirits and contencious Knowledges: and ouer all those that cleaue vnto thesame / the Iudgment of God goeth righteously, to the Confusion of them all, and Math. 25. to their Con∣demnacion in the hellish Fyer. For God wil now in his Daye of Loue / condemne the wick∣ed Worlde, with all her Wyseones, Adherents, and Louers. 6. Yea assuredly, now cometh the Lorde {reversed ;}out of his holy Heauen; Esa. 29 a. Ecli. 13. b. Luk. 17. Apo. 4. a. 8 a. with Lightenings and Thunders, and with a forsible Noyze of Wyndes: wherat the Earth shall Psal. 77 b. Esa. 13. b. Agg. 2. a. feare and tremble: and thatsame shall fall vppon all false Spirits and wicked Hearts / to their Destruc∣tion. Yea, now in thissame Daye of Loue / the Lorde wil mooue the Heb. 12. d. Earth, and it shall be forced to quake at his Thunders. And so the Lorde wil then make an Esa 10. c. Ende of all ye Fals∣hod of the Earth. 7. For now in thissame Daye of Loue / the Eccli. 16. b. 2. Pet. 3. b. Elements shall melt with the Heate of his Lightening. and the Lordes Thunder-boltes shall fall very greeuously vppon the Pate of all arrogāt Heartes, Self-wyseones, and all false Witnesses. Yea, all those that be touched ther∣with / shall nodout make-manifest themselues, and let it appeere / that they are touched, and are not of the Loues Nature. 8. But Saluation and Peace / cometh to the Lowely and Humble of Heart / Rom. 12. b. 1. or. 3. b. which are not wyse in themselues, but do submitt them
humbly vnder the Loue and her Seruice: also do take-heede to the Doctrine and Informa∣cion of thesame, and indeuour them obedient∣ly therunto: and do seeke no Pleasure nor Ioye without God and his Seruice of Loue, nor-yet in the Worlde, nor in the Flesh: but on∣ly Esa. 61. b. Luk. 2. c. in God their Saluacion. For it shall go-well with them, and in the Iudgment of God / they shall obtayne their Preseruacion or Sal∣uacion. 9. For in the Iudgment of God, when the Thunder-clapps do fall vppon the Arrogant and Self-wyseones / to their Destruction / then shall the holy Spirit of Lyfe / fall vppon the Littleones, and the Electedones of God / that haue humbly submitted them vnder the Obedience of the Loue / to their Preser∣uacion: and shalbe Num 11. c.

Act 2. b. poored-forth vppon them {reversed ;}with all Louelynes; out of the euerlasting Lyfe and heauenly Beeing / Iohn. 4.7. b like floweing Waters of Lyfe: and so shall then likewyse / Ioel. 3. c. Milke and Hony, and liueing Water of the holy Spirit of Loue / flowe among them. 10. Haue you all a regarde heerunto / ye good-willing Hearts and Louers of the Trueth. For Gods Iudgment / Esa. 11. a. Iohn. 7.8. b is not ac∣cording to the Sight of Mens Eyes, nor ac∣cording to their Knowledg (although notwith∣standing they do perswade themselues som∣tymes / that they knowe it well, and are assu∣red of the Mattier of it) but only according to the Trueth.
The II. Chap. FOrasmuch then as such a Day∣light {reversed ;}the which is the true Iudg∣ment of God; is {reversed ;}by Gods Grace; appeered vnto vs out of Heauen· and the gracious Woord of Lyfe vnder the Obedi∣ence of the Loue / geeuen vs to minister in the∣same Light / to the Saluacion of the People / Therfore were it also very right and conueni∣ent / that they shoulde giue eare vnto vs therin: and that noman shoulde so peruersly looke-into or construe the Workes of the Lorde / which He bringeth to light by vs Little and Elected∣ones of God. For veryly / thatt which wee speake and wryte, and bring-foorth, or set-out  vnder the Obedience of the Loue; to the serue∣ing of all Louers of the Trueth / is not our owne Worke, nor-yet our Indighting nor Wryting: but the Ier. 31 d. Ezech. 36. c 1 Cor. 2. a. 2. Tess. 1.2. b. Worke of the Lorde / which He himself wryteth according to his owne Mynd, Spirit, and Will / and with his owne Finger. 2. And whatsoeuerthen the Lorde himself bringeth-foorth / thatt do wee acknowledg to be good and vpright: And although it be look∣ed-on and iudged for Ignorance or to be foo∣lish / before the Children of Men, or before all those that account themselues wyse / Yet do wee confesse and shewe ther-against / that Gods Ignorance and his Foolishnes / is 1. Cor. 1.3. b wyser,
and procureth more Fruits of Righteousnes vppon the Earth / then all the Ingenious-witt of Mens Prudencie. 3. Therfore we regarde not how Men {reversed ;}out  of the Knowledg of their corrupt Vnderstand∣ing; do 1. Cor. 4 a. iudg Vs and the Seruice of Loue / which we minister. For it is well knowen vn∣to vs doutles / that all the Iudgments that the Man {reversed ;}out of his Ingenious-witt; iudg∣eth of the Wisdom and Workes of God / are false and Lyes: Psal. 116. b. Rom. 3. a. and that God with his Saintes / is only true / in his Iudgment. 4. And forasmuch as wee now in thissame Daye of Loue / are appeered before the Iudg∣ment-seate of Christ, and do carry the righ∣teous Iudgment of God in our Hearts / ther∣fore can no outlandish Men, nor any Estraing∣edones or Fallers from the Seruice of Loue / iudg vs / although they woulde neuer-so-fayne. For how shoulde they {reversed ;}I pray you; be able to iudg vs rightly / inasmuch as they cannot see vs? 5. Forasmuch then as they do Exo. 33. c. Iohn 5.14. b. 1. Iohn. 3.4. b not see the liueing God / in the Maiestee of his Glory / therfore can they not likewyse see Vs. For Wee, together with all the Holyones of God / do liue and tryumph vniformly with God / in his Glory, Esa. 3. b. Sap. 3. b. Math. 19 c. 25. d. 1. Cor. 6. a. Iude. . b. and do with Him / iudg the Worlde / with Righteousnes and Trueth / vnder the Obedience of his Loue. 6. Therfore also the Children of Men {reversed ;}that are without our Comunialtee or without the
Famyly of Loue; do vnderstande nothing-at-al {reversed ;}according to their Iudgment; of our holy Vnderstanding / which we suck out of the  Breastes of the Loue. 7. Veryly / therin do we acknowledg the Goodnes of God towards vs / that none of the foremencioned Men can ether see or iudg vs. But He himself / 1. Cor. 4. a. the true God of the Liueing {reversed ;}who is a God with vs; iudgeth euery thing by Vs, and his heauenly and spirituall Wis∣dom: and we vnderstande that his Iudgment is true. 8. If anyman then haue a Lust to doo the Will of the Lorde: also to be a Disciple of the Loue / in ye Schoole of Christ: and to vnder∣stande the secret Iudgment of God / let him go-out, or seperate his Heart / 1. Cor. 3. b. from all the Wisdom of the Worlde: and so com to our Comunialtee, and to the Wisdom that we shall showe him / vnder the Obedience of the Loue. 9. He being com to our Comunialtee vnder the Obedience of the Loue / so let him {reversed ;}for the Loue and her holy Vnderstandings cause; for∣sake Math. 10. d. 16. c. Mark. 8. d. Lud. 9.14. c himself, and all his Industry, Wisdom and Knowledg: and so haue regarde to ye Ser∣uice  of Loue / what it requyreth. 10. Now when-as he forsaketh himself for the Loues cause, and hath wholly geeuen-ouer himself to the Wisdom and to the holy Vnderstanding of the Loue / for to be obedient to thesame: and so taketh-heede to the Doc∣trine
of the Loue / in our Schoole of the chris∣tian Doctrine (not as a Iudg of thesame Doc∣trine, but as a Disciple / which is content to be informed and taught by the Doctrine of the holy Spirit of Loue) Then shall he Math. 13. b. well vn∣derstande the right Mynde of the Secretnes of the Loue, and the secret Iudgment of God. as also well perceaue / that God hath distinct∣ed and declared euery-thing wysely and vnder∣standably / with vs. and shall in-nowyse be able to see nor fynde / that-ther-is any Fault in our Wrytings and Ministracion of the Woord. as likewyse very-easely perceaue / that we do apparantly shewe the Submission, the Trueth, and the Patience / each-one in his right Place, and according to his right Order. in like-maner / the Beleefe, the Loue, and eue∣ry-thing {reversed ;}each-one in his; whatsoeuer serueth the Man to his Saluacion. 11. For how shoulde wee possible shewe any∣thing contrary or vnrightly / out of the Testi∣monyes of God, inasmuch as they stande so cleere and vpright before vs / in our Sight, and that God is Deu. 8 b. Phil 2. b. Ephe. 3. c. Heb 13 c. the Worker, and the Bringer-foorth of thosame Testimonyes him∣self? The III. Chap. BVt, Albeit now that anyone of  the vnrenewed Men / do yet for-the-present-tyme {reversed ;}by reason of his Inge∣nious-witt or Blyndnes of Heart;
looke peruersly into the Loueing-kyndnes of God, and the vpright Vnderstanding {reversed ;}wit∣nessed out of Gods mostholy Seruice of Loue; or construe it to the worst / yet is not the Worke of God, nor the vpright Vnderstand∣ing {reversed ;}which we bring-foorth out of God; per∣uerse for-al-that: neither-yet is God, nor Wee {reversed ;}his Ministers; to be blamed / for such a per∣uerse Sight: but hee which {reversed ;}out of his peruerse Math. 5.6. c 18. a. Sight; Iudgeth falsly. 2. For if the Earth {reversed ;}which doutles is altoge∣ther blynde and ignorant in the Arte or Worke of the Potter; do iudg a Esa. 2.45. b. Rom. 9. c. Potters Worke wrong / then is it no-dout greatly to be blam∣ed, because that it knoweth not the Honorabl∣est / from the Dishonorablest, nor the Fore∣most / from the Hindmost, nor-yet any of the Workmasters Tooles. For-that-cause also / it knoweth not how to distinct them rightly. 3. Euenso is likewyse the earthly Man to be blamed / that iudgeth the Worke of the Lorde peruersly / because that he seeth so purblyndly: and therfore he Esa. 59. a. 2. Pet. 1. b. gropeth or coniectereth after it / like a Blynd-body: or-els {reversed ;}out of the Pur∣blyndnes of his Sight; he iudgeth the Hind∣most / for the Foremost, and the Foremost / for the Hindmost, the Wagon / for the Horsses, and the Horsses / for ye Wagon, and Men / for Trees. And so through his Ignorance / he also nameth the Carpenters Tooles contrary∣ly. For like as the Sight and Discerning of
the Man is peruerse, euenso is also his Iudg∣ment. 4. Seing then that his Eyes are not cleere, and Ier. 4. a. . b Math. 6. . 7. a. Luk. 6. c. 11. d. Act. 7. f. 1. Iohn. 2. b that his Eares are thick, and that his Body is yet darke: and that therfore he be∣holdeth not the Sunne of Righteousnes: nei∣ther-yet standeth in thatt Place whear she giue∣eth her Cleernes: but is altogether a Straun∣ger therfrom / Therfore doth he neither knowe nor vnderstand anything-at-all of the Cleer∣nes of the Sunne. For-that-cause he can∣not also iudg in the Light, nor according to the Trueth. 5. Now when an illuminated Man {reversed ;}with the Cleernes of his Eyes; seeth into the Trueth of God: and that he likewyse witnesseth of the Beawtyfulnes of the Daye-light of ye Sunne: also giueth such high Honour and Prayse vnto thesame Light: and therfore testifyeth / that no vncleere Eyes, Math. 6. c. nor darke Bodyes / haue Iohn 5. d. euer seene or knowen such a gloryous Light / in his Cleernes: and that then thosame Testi∣monyes do com before the Eyes and Eares of the earthly Man, Pro. 3. a. Esa. 5 c. Rom. 1.12. b. 1. Cor. 3. b. who thinketh himself to be wyse, or to be illuminated / through his Know∣ledg / So doth then thatt earthly or self-wyse Man suppose {reversed ;}according to the Imaginacion of the Knowledg or false Light; that the illu∣minated Man / doth not testify rightly of the Cleernes of the true Light of God. 6. Therfore, because that the vnilluminated  Man / seeth so poreblyndly, and cannot see nor
endure Gods Light / in his Eyes, he iudgeth {reversed ;}out of the false Light / that hath captiued his Heart; the illuminated Vnderstanding / to be wrong. 7. Then when an illuminated Man / testify∣eth of the Loue of God, and of the Spirit of thesame▪ and that eueryone ought to submitt them obediently ther-vnder: and then when thosame Testimonies do com before the Eares of those ▪ that looke vppon the Flesh, and not vppon the Spirit / Then do they iudg the Loue▪ and the Loues Spirit and Requyring / vppon an outward Man, euen as though the outward Man himself / requyred the Obe∣dience and Loue, and {reversed ;}according to the Flesh▪ named himself / the Spirit of Loue, or tooke Gods Dignitee vpon him. 8. Therfore veryly, a fleshly or earthly Man {reversed ;}that liueth without the Seruice of Loue / ac∣cording to his owne Goodthinking; is altoge∣ther false, Psal. 116. b. Rom. 3. a. lying, and ignorant [namely / in godly Things] in all his Sightes, Know∣ledges, and Iudgments. The IIII. Chap. BEholde, my beloued Hearts in the Loue: This coulde I not hyde from you / To thend that ye may be∣ware of the false Iudgments of the deuided Men. and for that ye shoulde not ouer-reache yourselues / in iudging anything rashly.
For-that-cause let eueryone let the Iudgment alone, and gett first a Apo 3. c. cleere Sight, and a pure Soule / in the Loue / That he be not iudged be∣fore the Iudgment-seate of Christ (before the which we stande) for a false Iudg. 2. Oh! How well is he mynded / that iudgeth not, and that construeth and accepteth all in good part / that is witnessed or spoken to him / vnto good: and so walketh in stillnes, and keepeth his Mouth / Psal. 3. . as if ther hung a Lock before it, that he lye not: and which falleth not  through his Tongue. 3. Therfore canst thou not excuse thyself /  Man, Ro  whosoeuer thou bist that iudgest. For wherin thou iudgest another / therin condem∣nest thou thy self, inasmuch as thou thyself act gilty in thatt / wherin thou iudgest another. 4. By diuers of these false Iudgers / am I greatly impugned: so that I haue had great cause geeuen me by Many / to wryte against them: but thatt haue I not vsed hetherto {reversed ;}as against any Person or Company perticulerly; nor named them by Name. but haue witnessed generally / the Ignorance of the Blaspheamers and Resisters of the Loue▪ and made it knowen to the Vnderstandingones. 5. Forasmuch then as our Seruice hath his  Ministracion vnpartially / through the Loue / therfore is it not also our Vce / to wryte against anyman perticulerly {reversed ;}as by any name of Per∣son and Company; nor-yet to disprayse, or to prayse them / by their Names: but to shewe
generally {reversed ;}according as the vnpartiall Seruice of Loue requyreth it; what is Good or Euell for eueryone: and wherin the Man hath Right or Wrong: and that altogether out of God, 2. Cor. 3. a. and not out of ourselues. 6. For the Lorde himself {reversed ;}as a righteous and vnpartiall God; hath {reversed ;}according to his Pro∣myses; made his Iudgment / Esa 28. b. a Measure-lyne, and his Righteousnes / a Ballance / among vs. Therfore wee do neither receaue nor-yet giue-foorth anything / vnles we do measure it all vnpartially / with the Measure-lyne of the Iudgment of God: and weigh it all likewyse according to his Value / Eccl. 21. c. 28. d. in the Ballance of the Righteousnes of God. 7. Oh! That yee all did so likewyse, and ac∣cording to thesame maner / stoode concordably and vnpartially mynded with vs / vnder the Obedience of the Loue: and that euen so euery∣one did first learne {reversed ;}vnder the Obedience of the Loue; to keepe-scilence, and then to speake rightly: also learned first to suffer Wrong, and so to knowe therby / thatt which is Right / er-euer he gaue any Sentence of the Right / to thend that he mought speake according to the Trueth, and iudg Iohn 7. c. rightly: As likewyse learn∣ed first / to endure 2. Cor. 6. a. Shame, Dishonour, and Dispising / with Christ, and therby to knowe Gods Honour / er-euer he tooke-vpon-him to defende Gods honour, and to alow himsef to be right in his Iudgment. Consider effec∣tually heeron.
8. SEing then that the many-maner of  Perills {reversed ;}growing by the Iudgments of Men; are knowne vnto vs / therfore do wee {reversed ;}with this small Instruction; exhort all Lo∣uers of the Trueth / that noman vndertake or set-forward himself to iudg / 1. Co. 4. ▪ before the tyme, nor-yet speake to-soone: but that eueryone do first {reversed ;}vnder the Obedience of the Loue; becom Luk. 14. c. a Distiple of Christ: and so Ephe. 4. b. Col. 1. b. 1. Pet. 2. a. growe-vp in the holy Woord of the Spirit of ye Loue of Christ / to the Age of the holy Vnderstanding of Christ. 9. Then when he is becom a Christian or an Elder of Christ / in ye holy Vnderstanding / so can he then likewyse {reversed ;}through his new Birth; iudg rightly / Sap. 3. a. Math. 19.  1. Cor. 6. a. with Christ, and with all the Saintes of God / but otherwyse / all his Iudgments are false. 10. If anyman be now (as is before sayde) becom a Disciple in the holy Vnderstanding of Christ / vnder the Obedience of the Loue, and so {reversed ;}euen vnto the Regeneracion; be growen an Elder therin / Hee shall then well vnderstande the Elders in the holy Vnderstanding, or the Ministers of the holy Woord in the Famyly of Loue / in their secret Wisdom: and in no-wyse stryue nor contende {reversed ;}with his Vnderstanding; against the Elders in the Loue of Iesu Christ / which do minister the Woord of Lyfe vnder the Obedience of the Loue: but shall likewyse himself {reversed ;}as an vnderstanding Elder with the auncient Elders; informe the Disciples of the

But to the Disciples it is sayde: Math. 7. a. Lu. 6. d. Iudg not, and resist Math. 5. d. Mom 12. b. 1. Tess. 5. b. not also the Wicked. 12. Therfore sayth the Age of the Man Christ / to the Disciples: Math. 11. c. Learne of Mee: for I am humble and meeke of Heart. The V. Chap. TAke this effectually to heart, all yee that perswade yourselues / that ye are com to the Age of the Man Christ / by meanes of the Knowledg: and looke well into yourselues / whether that yee like∣wyse / haue (in maner as is before sayde) bin Luk. 14. c.

But if it haue not gon so with you / then take not vpon you also / to iudg any godly Matters, nor to defende Gods Honour, nor-yet to teache anyman: but be content to be

If wee now do in that maner / growe-vp peaceably in all Loue and Righteousnes / then shall the contencious and deuided Esa. 21. a. Ier 51. a▪ Apo. 14.18. a.

to the Loue. For ther-is nothing wyser nor more prudent / then the Loue. 6. Therfore is the Loue in her Follishnes / much godlyer to heare and to beleeue / then all the Wisdom of this Worlde. 7. For-that-cause it hath likewyse so pleas∣ed God / to bring-foorth his Wisdom / 1.

For in-that-sort wil God now in the last tyme / bring his Kingdom vnto his Saints and Electedones: and they shall raigne Apo. 21. b. vppon the Earth. 8. But all Self-wyseones, and all those that growe offended at the out-flowing Woord of the Lorde, and at his Seruice of Loue: and wil therfore out of their euell Hearts / contende or dispute against thesame· and make Rom. 16. c.

For the Lorde is Psal. 34. a. freendly vnto all those that loue Him, also faythfull and true vnto all those that haue a Delyte and Plea∣sure in the Wayes of his Loue. 3. But to the Dispisers of his Loue / which do arrogantly contemne, blaspheame, and re∣sist his Will / He is as Indignacion Eccli 5. a. and

But whosoeuer doth wilfully contemne the Lorde and the Righteousnes of his louely Beeing, and inclyneth to the Worlde or to his owne Good-thinking / hee shall beare his Iudgment / whosoeuer he bee. 10. Inasmuch then {reversed ;}ye Deerly-beloued; as that wee haue now{reversed ;} vnder the Obedience of the Loue; sett our Hope / towards God, and our Beleefe / towards his Saluacion / Ther∣fore let vs now likewyse{reversed ;} through the Seruice of the holy Spirit of Loue; take a Heb. 5. a. cheerfull Passage {reversed ;}in Iesu Christ; to God the Father, and to his gloryous and louely Maiestee. and not regarde the Temptacions of the wicked Worlde and of our Resisters. 11.

And although it seemeth to be a small or simple Wisdom / yet is it a Wisdom that is Math. 11. c 13. b. secret before all Self-wyse and Good-thinking-ones / for to com therunto. 4. Therfore is the simple Wisdom of God {reversed ;}that is obtayned in the Obeying of the Loue; a Wisdom / wherwith the Wyfe, the Scrip∣ture-learned, and the Great-knowers in this
Worlde / Esa. 29. b 1. Cor. 1. b. be made ashamed, and caught in their Wysdom. 5.

BEholde and consider / ye Beloued: In the Begining / Gen 1. c when God had made al-things well / then was the Lorde / a Lorde of his Kingdom, and a God of his
Workes. Ther was not also in his Kingdom, nor-yet in all his Workes / any-more then one God, and one Man: and they were One, and had in all respects / one Kynde, Beeing, and Nature: And so {reversed ;}at thatt tyme; God was all what the Man was, and the Man all what God was. 4. And when God looked vpon the Man / Gen 1. c. Sap 2 c. Eccli. 17. a. whom He had created according to the like Be∣ing of his Godhead, and with whom He was manned / then looked He vpon himself, as the∣same Cleernes of his liueing Godhead / vni∣forme with the Manhod. 5. Beholde, thus vniforme with the true Beeing of God / was the Man in the Begin∣ing: and this was all one Beeing / the Man and God. And so God behealde Gen. 1 d. his Worke which He had made / that it was Good. 6. And when the Man likewyse behealde his God / with whom he was godded / then sawe he {reversed ;}in thesame Cleernes of his God; the noble and pure Cleernes of his Manhod / vniforme with the Godhead, and perfect in all Vertues and Beawty▪ namely, according to all the Frome and Beeing of thesame Godhead. Lo, this was likewyse all One / Iohn 17 c. Ephe 2 b God and the Man. 7. Seing now that These {reversed ;}God and the Man; were One / so was-ther likewyse no∣more but one Kingdom / in Heauen, nor vp∣pon Earth: and thatt was the Kingdom of the God of Heauens, and the euerlasting Lyfe /
which had his perfect Beawty and Cleernes both vppon the Earth and in Heauen / with the Man, and in the Man. And ther-was nowheare any Sap. 1. c. Kingdom of Hell, nor Death, nor-yet any Vnrighteousnes / neither in Hea∣uen nor vppon Earth. For God had made all Things good and well / which He had made: and also created him nomore but one Man, who was as God himself. And God blessed this Man: and hath sayde vnto him / that he shoulde growe or increase him, re∣plenish Gen. 1. c. the Earth, and bring it vnder him. 8. Also God gaue no other Customs, Rytes, Lawes, nor Commaundements vnto the Man / in the Begining / but to liue with Ioye and an Gen. 2. b vncouered Heart / in the naked or vn∣couered Cleernes of his God, and likewyse to walke alwayes naked or vncouered / before Him: and that he shoulde euenso beholde all the Workes of God / for good / and not for euell· knowe nothing but Good / and not any Euell· and taste or feele nothing-els but Lyfe / and not any Death· Saluation / and not any Condemnacion. The II. Chap. BEholde: Thatt woulde God, and  that thesame shoulde continue in that maner and euerlastingly with the Man / to thend that his Kingdom
[namely, the Man / with the Godhead] shoulde {reversed ;}as one only peaceable Kingdom / in all Louelynes; beare en. . c. d the Dominion ouer the vniuersall Earth / to the Welfare of all Crea∣tures. 2. But as-soone as the Man turned-away the Sight of his Eyes / from his God, and looked vppon himself: and so turned-vnto and loued himself / thē perceaued he that he was not altogether the highest Godhead himself· but with the Godhead / a Man also, Gen 3 a. and became tempted to the Knowledg of Good and Euell, for to bee ther-through in euery-respect / as God himself. 3. When the Man had geeuen-ouer himself ther-vnto· and taken-on such a Fruit / of the Knowledg of Good and Euell / then came Blyndnes ouer him, Gen. 3. a. and he estrainged or se∣perated himself from the louely Cleernes of his God. By meanes wherof / he coulde not en∣dure the Woord or the Voyce of his God· nor appeere before Him / with his naked Manhod: but was Gen. 3. b. ashamed before God / of his naked Manhod. 4. He coulde not also beholde, nor conceaue any other Light or Cleernes / but thatt which he framed to himself / out of the Knowledg of Good and Euell: or, euen-as thesame Know∣ledg imagined it in him. The which was all Ignorance and Darknes: and was alwayes to a more Leading-awaye or Estrainging of
the Man from his God, who is the Iohn 1. a 8. b. 9. . 12.  euerlast∣ing Light and the true Wisdom. 5. He fealt likewyse no other Lyfe of Righte∣ousnes, nor Peace or Rest in his Conscience / but thatt which he himself forged and tooke-on out of the Knowledg of Good and Euell. The which was all wrong, and nothing but Sinne, Death, and Vnrestfulnes. 6. He knew not also any other God, King∣dom of Heauens, nor Saluacion / but such as he prefigured vnto himself / through thesame forenamed Knowledg / which the Man him∣self had taken-on. The which was nothing-els / but the Deuill himself· the Kingdom of Hell· and the euerlasting Condemnacion. Sap. 1. . whom / God woulde not that they shoulde bee vppon the Earth. 7. And euenthus did the Darknes and the Deuill ؛ Iohn. . c. the Father of Lyes{punctel} as also the King∣dom of Hell {reversed ;}as a deadly and damnable Bee∣ing; gett a Foorme in the Man: and so be∣came the Man, and all what was borne of him / Gen. . b. Rom. 5. b. 1 Gor 15 c. subiect to the Death and all Destructi∣on: and he gott in that maner / the Ier. 17. a. craftiest Heart / aboue all the Beastes vppon Earth / by which meanes / the whole Worlde is growne so Eccli. 37. . full of Falshod. 8. COnsider well now {reversed ;}ye goodwilling Hearts; what a destructionable Heri∣tage the Generacions of Men haue inherited / through the Knowledg of Adam: wherthrough the Man (who is created by God / for to be

Which Destruction of the harmfull Knowledg / we may now easely perceaue / through the Cleer∣nes of thissame Daye, and through the Declar∣ing of the Seruice of Loue / if we haue regarde theron: and that cheefly eueryone in him∣self. 9.

He is entered into the Knowledg of Men, and hath founde the much knowing Wisdom, together with her Scripture-learnednes / false and lying / in all what she knewe. 11. This false Knowledg (inasmuch as she 1 Cor 1 b vnderstood not the Trueth of God rightly / by all her Wisdom nor Scripture-learnednes) hath Christ Math 23. rebuked. also brought-in a true Knowledg / besydes thesame, and taken 2 Cor 1. a cap∣tiue

FArdermore {reversed ;}my beloued Freends in the Loue; I must yer wryte a little vnto you / for the necessitees-cause of this present Tyme. Which Tyme is now full of Perills / 2. Timo. 3. a 2. Pe. 2. a. to the Hurt of the Soule, and to the Hinderance of our Ser∣uice of Loue, which is the vpright and true God-seruice / that reacheth to the euerlasting Lyfe. 2. Therfore looke sharply to it: O Yea {reversed ;}ye Deerly-beloued; looke sharply to it in any∣wyse: and haue alwayes a watchfull Eye / with a cleere Sight. For this saye I vnto
you / out of a liueing Sight of the Trueth, that it behoueth vs now to haue a sharpe Circum∣spection / in our mostholy Seruice of Loue, and for the crafty Subtiltees cause of the Flesh (which we {reversed ;}alas; do fynde to abounde) not to beleeue anyone to-simply at the first, nor-yet to trust the On-commers or Disciples {reversed ;}which giue themselues to our Seruice of the Woord; to-much at the first, as to thinke that they are so altogether playne and vpright· simple and deuout / as they make showe for. 3. Although likewyse that they do loueingly  adioyne vnto vs, and make a fayer Showe / as if all their Lust were bent towards the Woord of Lyfe / Yet do not for-al-that ac∣cept them 1. Timo. 5.  ouer-hastyly / for vpright Brothers or Sisters in our holy Comunialtee, as to giue any such respect vnto them at thesame instant / for to talke or to deale with them {reversed ;}like-as with the Elders; touching all the Secretnes of the heauenly Kingdom: but let them {reversed ;}for a tyme; Col. 1. b. 1. Pet 2. a. growe-vp among you / in the Woord, and shewe faythfull 1. Pet. 1. b c Obedience in all what the Woord {reversed ;}vnder the Obedience of the Loue; re∣quyreth: and then if thesame do appeere in thē / ye shall well perceaue therby / whether they al∣so desyre with vs / to liue the vpright Beeing of Iesu Christ / in all Loue and Concord. For in the Tryall {reversed ;}when-as they be chastenably in∣formed with the holy Woord· and taught to the Obedience of the Requyring of the Woord / and must beare Reproche, 1. Cor. 6. b. Blaspheaming,

But in all this / loue you them / to their Saluacion and Preseruacion: and carry al∣wayes a fauourable Heart of Loue towards them, and marke whether that they do also in∣tende the vpright Beeing of the Loue / with all their Hearts / or no: and so do neither seeke, loue, nor desyre anything-els at our handes / but to liue the vertuous Nature of the Loue, to walke therin, and to growe-vp Ephe. 4. b. to be Elders in the holy Vnder standing of the gracious Woord. 5. Therfore / for to marke thessame now / ye shall let them {reversed ;}in the Growing-vp to the Old∣nes of the holy Vnderstanding; conuersae thē∣selues among you in stillnes for a certen tyme, and haue a circumspect regarde vnto them / whether they likewyse are Math. 2. c. faythfull in the Woord: and so marke what is the Cheefest-thing that they seeke and desyre at our handes / in the Seruice of the holy Woord: 1. Cor. 10. c. Phil. 2. c. whether it be their Owne-selfnes, or whether that they de∣syre to serue the God of Lyfe / in his Loue. If you haue in-this-maner a regarde heerun∣to, ye shall soone perceaue / whether it be Flesh / or Spirit· Earthly / or Heauenly· and Cor∣ruptible / or Euerlasting, that they Gal. 3 . seeke or de∣syre at our handes. 6· Seing then that the Tymes are now dain∣gerous,
wherin we perceaue and fynde so many and sundry-sorts of Wylynes and Subtiltees of the Flesh / therfore be you also carefull or sus∣piceous at the first (yet hopeing of som better) whether ther mought be likewyse any Subtil∣tee or Deceit / in the on-coming Desciples, or whether they mought not seeke or desyre any∣thing-els besydes the gracious Woord and Seruice of Loue, as namely / the Honour and Gal. . b. 1.

Looke and consider aduisedly heeron: for  thesame shall ye for-the-most-parte / fynde euen so among many On-commers: and that also many wicked Generacions or corrupt Na∣tures of Men {reversed ;}although they talke of the Loue; do meane nor thinke or intende nothing-els among vs. Therfore many likewyse wil see nothing-els / but according to the 1.

But wheare we haue founde it with Ma∣ny, as that the on-coming Disciples / do {reversed ;}with all their Hearts; 1. Pet. 5. a.

For verryly, such a Man / who doth in that sort {reversed ;}in the gracious Woord and Seruice
of Loue; seeke and intende the Nature of God / with all his Heart (although he were yet laden with many Sinnes) is a Iohn. 1. c. right Isralite, a Sonne or Daughter of Abraham Iohn. . . Rom. 9. a.

Cor. 7. b. lament, nor moorne ther-ouer: but go-on arrogantly and carelesly with ympenitent Heartes / like those that shewe no Sorrow nor Amendment touching the Sinne, and so do make no Difference betwixt the Freendshipp with the Worlde / and the Freendshipp with the Famyly of Loue: All thosesame / seeke no∣thing-els
but their Selfnes, and thatt which concerneth the Flesh / Phil. 2. c. and not the Lorde, nor the Righteousnes of his gracious Woord. 5. And such Deut. 9. o. Ier. 4. b. Act 7. f. Vncircumcised of Heart, which also are vncircumcised of Lippes and Toung: Yea, such goodthinking Spirits, 2. Timo. 3. 2. Pet 2. b.

Eccli 17. exhort them to som better thing: or informe them with a better Loue to the righteous Bee∣ing, hoping if the Lorde vouchsafe thesame / that they mought once be mooued vnto Repen∣tance for their Sinnes. 6. Forthatcause reiect them not: 2. Tess. 3 b. nor hate not anyone / what Sinners soeuer they bee: but 1. Tess. 5. b. Heb. 3.10. c exhort you still one-another to Amend∣ment: and carry alwayes an Heart of Loue / for to drawe the strayed Sinners out of their Sinnes, and to leade them Pro. 3.4. b. into the Path of the vpright Lyfe / to thend that they mought obtayne a godly Lyfe / vnder the Obedience of the Loue.

Forasmuch then as the Loue doth make-manifest herself so vprightly and loueingly / in her Seruice, and hath no pleasure in those 1.

Keepe a good watch in-any-wyse towards the Seperatedones, which do alwayes bring-in much Questioning and Contencion about the Knowledg / and do not first-of-all / giue themselues to the Doctrine of the Seruice of Loue, nor to Pro. 28.

Which louely Beeing / is the Head-somme of all Wisdom and Knowledg. Haue a sharpe regarde heer-vnto / for that the Kingdom of Loue may increase in all Concord, and be spread-abroade. 5. Therfore let not your Hearts stande-af∣fected vnto Any / but those that seeke Ephe. 4. a.

And although it be knowen vnto me / that  ye do also partly with mee / see into the Differ∣ence of thatt wherof I wryte vnto you / yet am I notwithstanding constrayned / to wryte, and to present thissame vnto you / To thend that ye shoulde alwayes be myndfull / not to put to-much trust at the first / in the on-coming Dis∣ciples / which inclyne vnto vs in the Seruice of Loue, as to declare all the Misteryes of God / among them. 1 Cor 2. . but well among those that are growing-vp with vs obediently / in the holy and godly Testimonyes of the Spirit of Loue / to the Ephe 4 b Agednes of the holy Vnderstanding: and those which we fynde faythfull therin /
