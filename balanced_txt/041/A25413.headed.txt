A SUMMARIE VIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT BOTH OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT: WHEREBY The Episcopall Government of Christs Church is vindicated: Out Of the rude Draughts of LANCELOT ANDREWES, late Bishop of Winchester. Whereunto is prefixed (as a Preamble to the whole) a Discovery of the Causes of the continuance of these Contentions touching Church-government: out of the fragments of RICHARD HOOKER, OXFORD, Printed by LEON LICHFIELD, Anno Dom, 1641.
The causes of the continuance of these Contentions concerning Church-Government. COntention ariseth, either through er∣rour in mens judgements, or else disor∣der in their affections. 1. When contention doth grow by errour in judgement; it ceaseth not till men by instruction come to see wherein they erre, and what it is that did deceive them. Without this, there is neither policy nor punishment that can e∣stablish peace in the Church. The Moscovian Emperour, being weary of the in∣finite strifes and contentions amongst Preachers, and by their occasion amongst others, forbad preaching utterly throughout all his Dominions; and in stead thereof commanded certain Sermons of the Greeke and Latine Fathers to bee translated, and them to be read in publique assemblies, without adding a word
of their owne thereunto upon paine of death. Hee thought by this politique devise to bring them to a∣greement, or at least to cover their disagreement. But so bad a policy was no fit salve for so great a soare. We may think perhaps, that punishment would have beene more effectuall to that purpose. For neither did Solomon speak without book in saying, that when folly is bound up in the heart of a child, the Prov. 32. 15. rod of correction must drive it out; and experience doth shew that when errour hath once disquieted the minds of men and made them restlesse, if they doe not feare they will terrify. Neither hath it re∣pented the Church at any time to have used the rod in moderate severity for the speedier reclaiming of men from error, and the reuniing such as by schisme have sundred themselves. But we find by triall, that as being taught and not terrified, they shut their eares against the word of truth and sooth themselves in that wherewith custome or sinister persuasion hath inured them: so contrariwise, if they be terrifyed and not taught, their punishment doth not commonly worke their amendment. As Moses therefore, so likewise Aaron; as Zeruba∣bel, so Iehoshua; as the Prince which hath laboured by the Scepter of righteousnesse and sword of justice to end strife, so the Prophets which with the booke and doctrine of salvation have soundly and wisely endeavoured to instruct the ignorant in those litigi∣ous points wherewith the Church is now troubled: whether by preaching, as Apolloes among the Iewes;
or by disputing, as Paul at Athens; or by writing, as the learned in their severall times and ages hereto∣fore; or by conferring in Synods and Councells, as Peter, Iames, and others at Ierusalem; or by any the like allowable and laudable meanes; their praise is 2. Cor. 8.18. worthily in the Gospell, and their portion in that pro∣mise which God hath made by his Prophets, They Dan. 12.3. that turne many unto righteousnesse shall shine as the starres for ever and ever. I say, whosoever have soundly and wisely endeavoured by those meanes to reclaime the ignorant from their errour, and to make peace. Want of sound proceeding in Church controver∣sies hath made many more stiffe in errour now then before. Want of wise and discreet dealing, hath much hin∣dred the peace of the Church. It may bee thought, and is, that Arius had never raised those tempestu∣ous stormes which we read he did; if Alexander, the first that withstood the Arrians heresy, had born himselfe with greater moderation, and been lesse ea∣ger in so good a cause. Sulpitius Severus doth note as much in the dealings of Idacius against the favou∣rers of Priscillian, when that heresy was but green and new sprung up. For by overmuch vehemency a∣gainst Iactantius and his mates, a sparke was made a fame: insomuch that thereby the seditious wax∣ed rather more fierce then lesse troublesome. In mat∣ters of so great moment, whereupon the peace or disturbance of the Church is knowne to depend, if
there were in us that reverend care which should be; it is not possible wee should either speak at any time without feare, or ever write but with a trembling hand. Doe they consider whereabout they goe, or what it is they have in hand; who taking upon them the causes of God, deale only or chiefly against the persons of men? We cannot altogether excuse our selves in this respect, whose home controversies and debates at this day, although I trust they be as the strife of Paul with Barnabas and not with Elymas; yet because there is a truth, which on the one side being unknown hath caused contention, I doe wish it had pleased Al∣mighty God, that in sifting it out, those offences had not grown, which I had rather bewaile with secret teares then publick speech. Neverthelesse as some sort of people is reported to have bred a detestation of drunkennesse in their children by presenting the deformity thereof in ser∣vants: so it may come to passe (I wish it might) that we beholding more foule deformity in the face and countenance of a common adversary, shall be indu∣ced to correct some smaller blemishes in our owne. Yee are not ignorant of the Demaunds, Motives, Cen∣sures, Apologies, Defences, and other writings which our great enemies have published under colour of seeking peace; promising to bring nothing but reason and evident remonstrance of truth. But who seeth not how full gorged they are with virulent, slnde∣rous and immodest speeches, tending much to the
disgrace, to the disproofe nothing of that cause which they endeavour to overthrow? Will you speake Iob. 13 7. wickedly for Gods defence? saith Iob. Will you dipp your tongues in gall and your pennes in blood, when yee write and speak in his cause? Is the truth confir∣med, are men convicted of their errour when they are upbrayded with the miseries of their condition and estate? When their understanding, wit and know∣ledge is depressed? When suspitions and rumours, without respect how true or how false, are objected to diminish their credit and estimation in the world? Is it likely that Invectives, Epigrammes, Dialogues, Epistles, Libells, loden with contumelies and crimi∣nations, should bee the meanes to procure peace? Surely they which doe take this course, the way of Rom 3.17. peace they have not knowne. If they did but once enter into a stayed consideration with themselves what they doe; no doubt they would give over and resolve with Iob. Behold I am vile, what shall I answer? I will Iob. 40.4, 5. lay my hand upon my mouth. If I have spoken once amisse, I will speak no more; or if twice, I will proceed no further. II. But how sober and how sound soever our pro∣ceedings be in these causes; all is in vaine which wee doe to abate the errours of men, except their unruly affections be bridled. Selfe-love, vaine-glory, impa∣tience, pride, pertinacy, these are the bane of our peace. And these are not conquered or cast out, but by prayer. Pray for Ierusalem; and your prayer shall
cause the hills to bring forth peace: peace shall distill Psal. 72.3, 6. and come downe like the raine upon the mowen grasse, and as the showers that water the earth. We have used all other meanes, and behold wee are frustrate, wee have laboured in vaine. In disputations; whether it be because men are ashamed to acknowledge their er∣rours before many witnesses, or because extempo∣rality doth exclude mature and ripe advise without which the truth cannot soundly and throughly bee demonstrated, or because the fervor of contention doth so disturbe mens understanding, that they can∣not sincerely and effectually judge: in Books and Ser∣mons; whether it be because we doe speak and write with too little advise, or because you doe heare and read with too much prejudice: in all humane means wch have hitherto been used to procure peace; whe∣ther it be because our dealings have been too fee∣ble, or the minds of men with whom we have dealt too too implacable, or whatsoever the cause or cau∣ses have been: for as much as wee see that as yet wee faile in our desires, yea the wayes which we take to be most likely to make peace, doe but move strife; O that we would now hold our tongues, leave conten∣ding with men, and have our talke and treaty of peace with God. We have spoken and written enough of peace: there is no way left but this one; Pray for the Psal. 122.6. peace of Ierusalem.
THE FORME OF GOVERNMENT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT: And first, under MOSES. THE Common-wealth of ISRAEL was considered, either as Personall, containing all the whole people, not a man left: or Represen∣tative; in the Estate, Tribes, Cities; whose daughters the Townes adjacent are called. I. The Estate had ever one Governour, 1. Moses. 2. Iosua. 3. Iudges. 4. Kings. 5. Tirshathaes, [or, Vice-royes, Ezra. 2. 63.] with whom were joyned the LXX. Elders.
II. The Tribes had every one their Prince,  Phylarcha. (Num. 2.) with whom were joyned the chiefe of the families,  Patriar∣chae. (Num. 1.4.) III. The Cities had each likewise their Ruler. (Iud. 9.30.1. King. 22.26. 2. King. 23.8.) with whom were joyned the Elders or Ancients. (Ruth. 4.2. Ezr. 10.14.) These last, not before they came into Canaan, [and were setled in their Cities.] It appeareth, that Moses sometime consulted only with  (the heads of the Tribes;) and then one Trumpet only sounded: (Num. 10.4.) in some other causes with the  (the Congregati∣on;) and then both Trumpets called. (Num. 10.3.) The highest BENCH or Iudgement, for causes of greatest difficultie, was that of the LXX. who at the first, were the Fathers of each familie that came down to Egypt. (Gen. 46.) which number did after that remaine; (Exod. 24.1, 9.) and was at last by God himselfe so appointed. (Num. 11.16.) See 2. Chron. 19.8. The inferiour BENCHES, for matters of lesse im∣portance, were erected by Iethroes advice of Rulers of Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties, Tithings. Exod. 18. 21, 26. and after established by Gods approbation. (Deut. 16.18.)
In every City (as Antiquit. l. 4. c. 8. Iosephus saith) were seven Iud∣ges; and for each Iudge, two Levites: which made to∣gether the Bench of each City. The forme of the Ecclesiastical government under MOSES. THe Priesthood was setled in the Tribe of Levi by God. Levi had three sons: Cohath, Gershon, and Merari. Of these, the line of Cohath was preferred before the rest. From him descended four Families: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Vzziel. Of these the stock of Amram was made chiefe. He had two sons: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was by God appointed High Priest. So that there came to be foure distinctions of Levits: 1. Aaron, as chiefe. 2. Cohath. 3. Gershon. 4. Merari. The Commonwealth of Israel was at the begin∣ning in the desert a Camp. In the midst whereof the Arke and Tabernacle were pitched: and according to the four Coasts whereof, they quartered themselves; on every side three Tribes.
On the East side:Iudah. Issachar Zabulon, On the South side:Reuben. Simeon. Gad. On the West side:Ephraim. Manasses. Ben∣jamin. On the North side:Dan. Aser. Napthali. Num. 2. v. 3. 10. 18. 25. These foure Quarters were committted to those foure Divisions of Levits: The East quarter, toAaron, and his fa∣mily. The South quarter, toThe Cohathites. The West quarter, toThe Gershonits. The North quarter, toThe Merarits. Num. 3. vers. 38. 29. 23. 35. Who lodged among them, and took charge of them, as of their severall Wards. But there was not a parity in these foure: for 1. Aarons family, which bare the Ark it selfe, was chiefe. 2. Cohaths, which bare the Tabernacle and vessels, next. 3. Gershons, which bare the veile and hangings of the Court, third. 4. Meraries, which bare the Pillars and Posts, last. Neither were all the Levits of each of these seve∣rall houses equall; but God ordeined a superiority a∣mong them: Over the Priests,Eleazar. Over the Cohathits,Elizaphan. Over the Gershonits,Eliasaph. Over the Merarits, Zuriel. Num. 3. v. 30. 24. 35.
Whom he termeth Nesiim, that is, Prelats or Su∣periors. No more did he permit these foure to be equals among themselves: but appointed Ithamar (Exod. 38.21.) to command over Eliasaph, with his Gershonits. (Num. 4.28.) Zuriel, with his Merarits. (Num. 4.33.) Eleazar (Num. 4.16.) to have jurisdictio over His own Fa∣mily. Elizaphan, with his Co∣hathites. Yea he maketh not Eleazar and Ithamar to be ab∣solute equals: but giveth Eleazar preeminence over Ithamar; and therefore termeth him Nasi Nesiim, Princeps Principum or Praelatus Praelatorum. (Num. 3.32.) And all these under Aaron the High Priest. So that, 1. Aaron was the High Priest. 2. Under him Eleazar: who, as hee had his peculiar charge to look unto, so was he generally to rule both Ithamars jurisdi∣ction and his owne. 3. Under him Ithamar, over two families. 4. Under him the three Prelats. 5. Under each of them, their severall chiefe
Fathers ( as they are termed Exod. 6.25.) under Elizaphan foure, un∣der Eliasaph two, under Zuriel two. (Num. 3.18, &c.) 6. Under these, the severall persons of their kindreds. This is here worth the noting, that albeit it bee granted that Aaron was the type of Christ, and so we forbeare to take any argument from him: yet Elea∣zar (who was no type, nor ever so deemed by any writer) will serve sufficiently to shew such superiori∣ty as is pleaded for; that is, a personall jurisdiction in one man resiant over the heads or rulers of diverse charges. The forme of government under JOSHUA. THe Common-wealth being changed from the ambulatory form into a setled estate in the Cities of Canaan: as before, the Levits were divided accord∣ing to the severall Quarters of the Camp; so now were they sorted into the severall territories of the Tribes. So God commanded; Num. 35.2, 8. The lot fell so, that the foure partitions of the XII. Tribes were not the same, as when they camped be∣fore together; but after another sort. For the Tribes of 1. Iuda, Simeon and Benjamin made the first Quarter.
2. Ephraim, Dan, and halfe of Manasses the second. 3. Issachar, Asher, Napthali, and the other halfe of Manasses the third. 4. Zebulun, Reuben, and Gad the fourth. Now in these foure; 1. The charge or oversight of the first was com∣mitted to Aaron and his family: and they had therein assigned to them XIII. Cities. in Iudah and Simeon, IX. and in Benjamin, IV. (Ios. 21.9, 10, &c.) 2. Of the second, the care was committed to the fa∣mily of the Cohathits: and they had assigned to them X. Cities. in Ephraim, IV. in Dan, IV. and in the halfe of Manasses, II. (Ios. 21.20.) 3. The third was committed to the family of Ger∣shon: and they had therein assigned to them XIII. Cities. in Issachar, IV. in Asher, IV. in Naphtali, III. in the other halfe of Manasses, II. (Ios. 21.27.) 4. The oversight of the fourth partition was com∣mitted to the Merarits: and they had therein assigned to them XII. Cities. in Zebulun, IV. in Reuben, IV. in Gad, IV. (Ios. 21.34.) These were in all, XLVIII. Cities: whereof the chiefe (as may appeare) were Cities set on Hills; and all so situate, in such proportion and distance, as that they most equally parted their Tribe among them, to performe unto them their duties of attendance
and instruction. Further, there were in Ioshuahs time added, by the decree of the Princes, the Nethinims of the people of Gibeon; for the lowest ministeries, and for the ser∣vice of the Levits. (Ios. 9.27.) So that now the order was thus: 1. Eleazar. 2. Phineas. 3. Abisua. 4. The three Nesiims. 5. The Rase Aboth, [or, Heads of the Fami∣lies.] 6. The Levits. 7. The Nethinims. If this power and superiority was necessary, when all the People and Priests were within one Trench, e∣ven within the view of Aarons eye: much more in Ca∣naan, when they were scattered abroad in divers Ci∣ties farre distant, was the retaining of it more then necessary. The forme of Government under DAVID. ALbeit in Sauls government small regard was had to the Church: yet David found at his comming a superiority amongst them. For besides the Priests, hee found six Princes or Rulers over six families of the Levits. (1. Chron. 15.5, 6, &c.)
Vrielover Cohath. Asajahover Merari. Ioelover Gershon. Shemajahover Elizaphan. Elielover Hebron. Amminadabover Vzziel. Likewise between the two Priests an inequality: one Abiathar, attending the Ark at Ierusalem, the higher function; the other, Zadok, the Tabernacle at Gibeon. (2. Sam. 20.25.1. Chron, 16.37, 39.) But after the Ark was brought back; he set a most exquisite order among the Levits: and that by Sa∣muels direction; 1. Chron. 9.22. So that he is there reckoned as a new Founder. Of them he made six orders: 1. Chron. 23. 1. Priests, 24000. vers. 4. 2. Ministers of Priests 3. Iudges, 6000. vers. 4. 4. Officers, 5. Singers, 4000. verse. 5. 6. Porters, 4000. 1. Of Priests, Zadok was the chiefe of the family of Eleazar; and Ahimelech the second, of the family of Ithamar. (1. Chron-24.3.) Under these were XXIIII. other Courses. Of the posteritie of Eleazar, XVI. Ithamar, VIII. 1. Chr. 24.4. Which XXIIII. are called (in the 5. verse)
Rulers of the Sanctuary and Rulers of the House of God: and to whom the learned In∣terpreters thinke the XXIIII. Elders, Apocal. 4.4. have relation. II. Of Levits that ministred to the Priests in their function, likewise XXIIII. Courses; out of the IX. VIII. families, the Heads of whom are set downe in 1. Chron. 23.6. and 24.20. Over all which, Jehdeiah was chiefe. III. Of Iudges, that sate for causes aswell of God as the King, there were appointed: 1. On this side Iordan, upwards toward the River; Ashhabiah the Hebronite. (1. Chr. 26.30.) 2. On this side Iordan, downwards towards the Sea; Chenaniah the Isharite. (1. Chr. 26.29.) 3. Beyond Iordan, over the two Tribes and the halfe; Ierijah the chiefe of the Hebro∣nites. (1. Chron. 26.31.) IIII. Of Officers. Scribes. Shemaiah. (1. Chron. 24.6.) Seraiaeh. (2. Sam. 8.17.) Shevah. (2. Sam. 20.25.) Scribes of the Levits. (1. Chron. 24.6.) Temple. (2. King. 22.3. Ier. 36.10) People. (Mat. 2.4.) King. (2. King. 12.10.) V. Of the Singers likewise he set XXIV courses: over which he placed three chiefe, out of the three
families. (1. Chron. 15.17. & 25.2, 3, 4.) Out of Cohath; Heman Samuels nephew. (1. Chr. 6.33) Gershon; Asaph. (1. Chron. 6.39.) Merari; Ethan or Ieduthun. 1. Chron. 6.44. Of these, Heman was the Chiefe. (1. Ch. 25.5) Vnder these were diverse others. (1. Chr. 15.18. VI. Of Porters, who were divided into the Keepers of the watch of the Temple: (Mat. 27.65. Psal. 134.1.) who were placed on each quarter of the Tabernacle. (1. Chr. 26.13, 14, &c.) On the East side VI. over whom was She∣lemiah. South IIII. (for the Tabernacle II. and II. for Asuppim) over whō was Obed. West IIII. over whom was Hosa. North IIII. over whom was Ze∣chariah. Over all these it seemeth Benajah, the son of Iehoiada the Priest, was the chiefe. (1. Chron, 27.5.) Treasu∣rers: for the Revenues of the house of God (1. Ch. 26.20.) for Things dedicated by vow; Shelomith. 1. Chron. 26.26.) Cohath; Shebuel of Moses of∣spring. Gershon; Iehiel. Merari; Ahiah.
Over all the Porters was Chenaniah. (1. Chr. 26.29. & 15.22, 27.) It is to be remembred that, beside Zadok the High Priest and Ahimelech (the second) we finde mention of Hashabiah the son of Kemuel chiefe of the whole Tribe of Levi. (1. Chron. 27.17.) So that there was One over the Ark; Zadok. The second over the Tabernacle; Ahimelech. The third over the Tribe; Hashabiah. As over the Levits Ministers; Iehdeiah. Iudges; Chasabiah. Officers; Shemaiah. Singers; Heman. Porters; Chenaniah, or Benaiah. Agreeable to this forme we read that under Iosias there were three: that is, Hilkiah, Zachariah, and Ie∣hiel: (2. Chron. 35.8.) and that the Levits had six o∣ver them. (2. Chron. 35.9.) Againe under Zedekiah; that there were carried in∣to Captivity Seraiah [the chief Priest] and Zepha∣niah [the second Priest.] 2. King. 25.18. Likewise under Ezekiah, at the provision for the Levits portions, there were ten of the Levits; over whom was Cononiah and Shimei: and so Kore over the voluntary offrings; and six Levits under him. (2. Chron. 31.12, 13. &c.)
The forme of government under NEHEMIAH: OF whom and Esdras it is recorded, that they did all according to Moses institution. (Ezr. 6.18. Nehem. 10.34, 36.) There was then Eliashib.Nehem. 3.1. Seraiah.11.11. Zabdiel.11.14. The Courses were then but XXII. (Neh. 12.12.) There was then Vzzi. (Neh. 11.22.) Iezrahiah. (Neh. 12.42.) Shallum. (1. Chron. 9.17.) Under Zabdiel, at his hand Adaiah. Nehem. 11. ver. 12, 13. Amasai. Nehem. 11. ver. 12, 13. Vnder Vzzi Shemaiah. Neh. 11.15, 16. Shabbethai. Neh. 11.15, 16. Iozabad. Neh. 11.15, 16. Vnder Iezrahiah Mattaniah. Neh. 11.17. Bakbukiah. Neh. 11.17. Abda. Neh. 11.17. Vnder Shallum Akkub. 1. Chron. 9.17. Nehem. 11.19. Talmon. 1. Chron. 9.17. Nehem. 11.19. So that there was 1. The High Priest. 2. The second & third, Overseers of the Priests. 3. The Princes of the Priests. 4. The Priests. 5. The Overseer of the Levits.
6. The Princes of the Levits. 7. The Levits. 8. The Heads of the Nethinims. 9. The Nethi∣nims: of the Gibeonits. 9. The Nethi∣nims: of Salomons servants. [A briefe Recapitulation of the degrees obser∣ved under the government of the Old Te∣stament: with an accommodation thereof unto the New.] Out of these we gather this Forme to have been. I. Moses: [in whom was] the supreme jurisdicti∣on, to visit Aaron. (Num. 3.10.) II. Aaron: the High Priest. (Levit. 21.20. Num. 35.28. Nehem. 3.1.) Head. (2. Chron. 19.11.) Prince of the house of God. (1. Chron. 9.11) III. Eleazar: the second. (2. King. 25.18.) Prelate of Prelats. (Num. 3.22.) Chiefe Overseer, or Bishop (Ier. 20.1.) At his hand, Ithamar. IV. Prince of the Tribe. (1. Chron. 27.17.) V. Elizaphan. Eliasaph. Zuriel. Prelats. (Num. 3.24, &c.) Overseers or Bishops. (Neh. 11.14, 22.) VI. [In] the XXIV. Courses set by David; The Princes of the Priests. (Ezr. 8.29.)
The Princes of God. 1. Chr. 24.5. The Princes of the Sanctuary. 1. Chr. 24.5. Elders of the Priests. (Ierem. 19.1. 2. King. 19.1.) Heads of the Families.  (Nehem. 12.12.) Chiefe Priests. (Act. 19.14.) VII. The Priests themselves: Whether at Ierusalem; or in the Countrey townes. (2. Chron. 31.19.) VIII. The Overseer of the Levits. (Nehem. 11.22.) IX. The Princes of the Levits. (1. Chron. 15.5. 2. Chron. 35.9. Nehem. 12.22.) X. The Head of the Levits Officers. The Scribe. The Singers. (1. Chro. 16.5. Neh. 12.42.) The Porters. (1. Chron. 9.17. & 15.22.) The Treasurers. (1. Chron. 26.24, 2. Chr. 31.12.) [XI. The Levits themselves.] XII. The Chief of the Nethinims. (Nehem. 11.21.) XIII. The Nethi∣nims: of the Gibeonits. (Ios. 9.21.) Salomons servants. (1. King. 9. 21. Nehem. 7.60.) It is not only requisite that things be done, and that they be diligently done (against sloth;) but that they be done continually, and constantly. To this end it is, that God appoints Overseers: 1. To urge others, if they be slack. (2. Chron. 24.5. & 34.13.) 2 To keep them in course, if they be well. (2. Chr.
29.5. and 31.12. and 34.12, 13.) 3. To punish, if any be defective. (Ierem. 29.26.) For which, A power of Commanding was in the High Priest. (1. Chron. 23.8, 18. and 24.6. and 31.13.) A power Iudiciall, if they transgressed: (Deut: 17. 9. Zach: 3.7. Ezech: 44.24. Under paine of death. (Deut: 17.12.) Punishment in Prison, and in the Stocks: (Ier: 29.26.) in the Gate of Benjamin. (Ier: 20.2.) Officers to Cite and Arrest: (Ioh. 7.32. Act: 5.18.) This Corporall. To suspend from the Function: (Ezr: 2.62.) To excommunicate. (Ezr: 10.8. Ioh. 9.22. and 12.) 42. and 16.2.) [This Spirituall.] Why may not the like be, [for the government of the Church:] There is alleaged one only stop. That the High Priest was a figure of Christ: who being now come in the flesh, the figure ceaseth, & no argument thence to be drawne. [For Answer whereunto, we are to consider; that] I. This is the Anabaptists only shift. That we are to have no Warres: for the warres of the Iewes were but figures of our spirituall Battell. No Magistrate: for their Magistrates were but figures of our Mini∣sters, Pastors, and Doctors. and, all by Christs com∣ming abolished.
II. Christ, being as well King as Priest, was as well fore-resembled by the Kings then, as by the High Priest. So that if his comming take away the one Type, it must also the other. If it be said, there was in the King somewhat else beside the represen∣tation: the like is and may bee truely said of the High Priest. And that some such thing there was, it is plaine by S. Paul, who yeelded his obedience to the High Priest; appearing before him, and acknowledg∣ing him a Governour of the People (Act. 23.5.) & that, after the Type was expired. Which had been meerely unlawfull; if there had not remained in him some∣what besides the Figure. III. There is no necessity we should presse Aa∣ron. For Eleazar being Princeps Principum, that is, ha∣ving a superiour authoritie over the Superiours of the Levits [in Aarons life time] was never by any [in this point] reputed a Type of Christ. So that though Aaron be accounted such; yet Eleazar will serve our purpose. As also, 2. Chron. 35.8. we read of three at once: one only of which was the High Priest, and a Type of Christ; the rest were not. Let them answer then to the other twaine, who were Rulers or Chiefe over the House of God. Why it may bee. I. Out of Dic Ecclesiae, [the New Reformers] ell us, we are to fetch our pattern from the Iewes: and therefore it seemes they are of opinion, that one forme may serve both us and them.
II. Except there should be such a fashion of Go∣vernment, consisting of inequality: I see not in the New Testament, how any could perish in that contra∣diction of Core, which S. Iude affirmeth. For his plea was for equalitie; and against the preferring of Aaron aboue the rest. III. The Ancient Fathers seem to be of minde, that the same Forme should serve both. So thinketh S. Cyprian, l. 3. ep. 9. ad Rogatianum. So S. Hierom, ep. 85. ad Evagrium. Traditiones Apostolicae sumptae sunt de Veteri Testamento. & ad Nepotianum, de vitâ Clericorum. So St Leo. It a veteris Testamenti sacramenta di∣stinxit; ut quaedam ex iis, sicut erant condita, E∣vangelicae eruditioni profutura decerperet: ut quae dudùm fuerant consuetudines Iudaicae, fierent ob∣servantiae Christianae. So Rabanus, de Institutione Clericorum, l. 1. c. 6. They ground this their opinion upon that they see, 1. That the Synagogue is called a Type or sha∣dow, and the Church the very image of the thing. (Heb. 10.1.) 2. That God himselfe saith of the Christian Church under the Gentiles; that he will take of the Gentiles, and make them Priests and Levits to him∣selfe. (Esai. 66.21.) there calling our Presbyters and Deacons by those Legall names.
3. That there is an agreement, in the Numbers: XII. Num. 1.16. and Luk. 9.1. LXX. Num. 11.16. & Luk: 10.1. Names: Angel. Malach. 2.7. and Revel. 1.10. And their often enterchange and indifferent using of Priest or Presbyter, Levite or Deacon, sheweth they presumed a correspence & agreement between them. [Thus then] Aaron [should be answerable unto] Christ. Eleazar [should be answerable unto] Archbishop. Princes of Priests [should be answerable unto] Bishops. Priests [should be answerable unto] Presbyters. Princes of Levits [should be answerable unto] Archdeacons. Levits [should be answerable unto] Deacons. Nethinims [should be answerable unto] Clerks and Sextons. THE FORME OF CHURCH-GOVERNMENT in the New Testament: and first in the dayes of our Saviour CHRIST. I. THe whole ministery of the New Testa∣ment was at the first invested in Christalone.
He is termed our Apostle. (Hebr. 3.1.) Prophet. (Deut. 18.15. Act. 3. 22.) Evangelist. (Esai. 41.27.) Bishop. (1. Pet. 2.25.) Doctor. (Mat. 23.10.) Diaconus. (Rom. 15.8.) II. When the Harvest was great, (Matth. 9.38.) that his personall presence could not attend all; he took unto him XII. Apostles: as the XII. Patriarchs, or XII. Exod. 15.27. Num. 33.9. Fountaines (as S. Ierom) or the XII. Princes of the Tribes. (Num. 1.) Gathering his Disciples, (Matth. 10.1.) Choosing out of them (Luk. 6.13.) Whom he would; (Mark. 3.13.) Called them to him, (Luk. 6.13.) Made them, (Mark. 3.13.) Named them Apostles. (Luk. 6.13.) These he began to send: (Mark. 6.7.) Gave them in charge, (Mat. 10.1. and 11.1.) To preach the Gospell. (Luk. 9.2.) To Heal. (Matth. 10.1. Luk. 9.2.) To cast out Devills. (Matth. 10.1.) Gave them power, (Mat. 10.1. Luk. 9.2.) To take maintenance, (Matth. 10.10.) To shake of the dust for a witnesse. (Matth. 10.14.) So he sent them. (Matth. 10.5. Luk. 9.1.) They went and preached. (Luk. 9.6.)
They returned, and made relationwhat they had done. taught. Mark. 6.30. III. After this, when the Harvest grew so great as that the XII. sufficed not all; (Luk. 10.1, 2.) hee took unto him other LXX. (as the 70. Palme-trees, Num. 33.9. the Fathers of Families, Gen. 46. the Elders. Num. 11) These he Declared: (Luk. 10.1.) Sent by two and two into every City and place, whither he himselfe would come. lb. Gave them power, as to the Apostles, to Take maintenance. (Luk. 10.7.) Shake off the dust. (Luk. 10.11.) Heale the sick. Luk. 10.9. Preach. Luk. 10.9. Tread upon Serpents and Scorpions, and over all the power of the Ene∣my. (Luk. 10.19) These two Orders (as me thinketh) S. Paul, Ephes. 3.5. doth comprehend under the name of Apostles and Prophets; by the LXX. understanding Prophets: as usually next to the Apostles he placeth Prophets ever. (1. Cor. 12.28. Ephes. 4.11.) None ofthe Fathers ever doubted, that these two were two severall Orders or Sorts: nor that the Apo∣stles were superiour to the LXX. It appeareth also, that [the Apostles] had in them power to forbid to preach: (Luk. 9.49.) and that Matthias was exalted from the other Order to the Apostleship.
This was then the Order, while Christ was upon the Earth. I. Christ himselfe. II. The XII. (whose successours were Bishops.) III. The LXX. (whose successours were Priests.) IV. The faithfull people or Disciples: of whom 500. and more are mentioned, in 1. Corinth. 15. 6. and CXX. in Act. 1.15. [The forme of government, used in the time of the APOSTLES.] Albeit Christ saith, the people were as Sheep with∣out a Shepheard: (Matth. 9. 38.) yet he tearmeth his Apostles Haruest men, not Shepheards. For while he was in person on Earth; himselfe only was the Shep∣heard, and they but Arietes gregis. But at his depar∣ture he maketh them Shepheards: (Iohn 21.15.) as they likewise at theirs. (1. Pet. 5.2. Act. 20.28) Of the APOSTLES themselves: and first, of their Name. Shelicha, which is the Syrian name, was the title of certaine Legats or Commissioners sent from the High Priest, to visit the Iewes and their Synagogues which were dispersed in other Countries; with au∣thority to redresse things amisse. , among the Greekes, were Officers of great credit: as by Herodotus and Demosthenes ap∣peareth. Secondly, of their Forme; what it is. Not to have been with Christ all his time. (Acts
1.21.) So were others moe. Not to be sent immediately of Christ. (Gal. 1.1.) So were the LXX. (Luk. 10.) Not to be limited to no one place. (Matth. 28. 19.) So were others (Luk. 24.33, 50.) And S. Iames went no whither. Not to be inspired of God; so that they did not erre. So were Marke and Luke. Not to plant Churches. So did Philip the Evan∣gelist. (Act. 8.5.) Not to work signes and miracles. So did Stephen (Acts 6.8.) and Philip. (Acts 8.6.) But over and above these, and with these, that emi∣nent Authority or Iurisdiction which they had o∣ver all; not only joyntly together, but every one by himselfe: I. Of imposing hands in Ordination. (Acts 6.6.) Confirmatiō. (Act 8.17, 18.) II. Of Commanding. (the word of the Bench. Acts 4.18. and 5.28.) 1. Thess. 4.11.2. Thess. 3.6, 12. Philem. 8. Coloss. 4.10.1. Cor. 14.37.2. Peter 3.2. Titus 1.5.1. Cor. 7.6, 17. and 11.34. & 16.1. III. Of Countermanding. (Luke 9.49. Acts 15.24.1. Tim. 2.12.) IV. Of Censuring. (1. Cor. 4.21.2. Cor. 13.10. Gal. 5.12.1. Tim. 1.20.1. Cor. 5.5, 11.2. Thess. 3.14. Matth. 16.19. with 18.18. and Iohn 20.23.) In this power it is, that the Bishops succeed the Apo∣stles. Irenae. lib. 3. cap. 3. Tertull. de Praescript. Cy∣prian. ad Florent. 3.9. Epiphan. Haeres. 27. (Romae

Ecclesiast. in Petro & Iacobo. Ambros: in 1. Corinth: 11. (de Angelis:) & in Ephes. 4. (Apostoli. Angeli sunt.) OF DEACONS. AT the beginning, the whole weight of the Churches affayres lay upon the Apostles. The distribution as well of the Sacrament. (Act. 2. 42.) as of the Oblations. (Act. 4.35.) The Ordination. (Acts 6.6.) The Government. (Acts 5.3.) [But] upon occasion of the Greeks complaint, whose widowes were not duly regarded in the dayly ministration (which was as well of the Sacrament, as of the Oblations: otherwise the Apostles would not have left out [the mention of] the Sacrament, in Acts 6.4.) they transferred that part upon the VII. [Deacons.] whom they had ordayned for distributi∣on [of the Sacrament,] not for Consecration. Act. 6.1. Tim. 3.12, 13. Iustin. Apolog. 2. Ignatius ad Heronem. Tertull: de Baptismo.

OF EVANGELISTS. THey grew upon occasion of the scattering of the Disciples by means of the persecution after the death of S. Stephen. (Acts 11.19.) Of which num∣ber S. Philip is reckoned: (Acts 21.8.) and diverse others. (Acts 11.19.) of whom Eusebius maketh mention, lib. 3. cap. 37. and lib. 5. cap. 10. Upon these was transferred that part of the Apo∣stles function, which consisted in preaching from place to place. OF PRIESTS. VVHen the Churches were in some sort plan∣ted by the preaching of the Apostles, Pro∣phets, and Evangelists: that they might be continu∣ally watered, and have a standing attendance; the A∣postles ordained Priests by imposition of hands in e∣very Church. (Acts 14.23. and 11.30. and 21.18.) And they made choyce of the word , rather then of the word  (more in use with the Greeks:) because it includeth an Embassie, and that chiefly of Reconciliation. which is the , ex∣pressed by S. Paul, in 2. Corinth. 5.20. (with Luke 14.32.)
OF BISHOPS. LAst of all, that the Churches thus planted and watered, might so continue, the Apostles ordai∣ned Overseers, to have a generall care over the Chur∣ches, in stead of themselves who first had the same, which is called , Acts 15.36. and containeth in it, as a strengthning or establishing that which is alrea∣dy well; (Acts 14.22. and 15.41. Revel: 3. 2.) so a rectifying or redressing, if ought be defective or a∣misse. (Tit: 1.5.) These are called, Acts 20.28.  in the Syrian, that is, Episcopi. by S. Iohn, Revel. 1.20. the Angells of the Churches. [These were set over others, both to rule and teach.] 1. Tim: 5.17. 1. Pet: 5.2. Upon these was transferred the chiefe part of the Apostolick function: The Oversight of the Church. Power of Commanding, Correcting, Ordaining. The occasion which caused the Apostles to ap∣point Bishops, [besides the patterne in the time of the Law,] seemeth to have been schismes. Such as were in the Churches of Rome. Rom. 16.17. Corinth. 1. Cor. 1.11. [and 3.3, 4.]
Galatia. Gal. 5.12. Ephesus. Ephes. 4.2, 3. Philippi. Phil. 4.2. Colossi. Coloss. 3. 13. Thessalonica. 2. Thess. 3.11. The Hebrews. Hebr. 13.9. Iam. 3.1. For which S. Cyprian, S. Hierome and all the Fa∣thers, take the respect to one Governour to be an e∣speciall remedy. [for which also see] Calvin. Instit. lib. 4. cap. 4. §. 2. This power even in the Apostles time was neces∣sary. Act. 5.5, 15. 13. 11. 2. 11. 10. 46. 14. 11. 8. 13. 5.11, 13. For God chargeth not his Church with super∣fluous burdens. Yet had they such graces (as power of healing, doing signes, sundry languages, &c.) that they of all other might seem best able to want it. For by these graces they purchased both admiration and terrour sufficient for crediting their bare word in the whole Church. If necessary then in their times, that were so furni∣shed: much more in the ages ensuing, when all those graces ceased, and no meanes but it to keep things in order. So that, were it not apparant to have been in the Apostles: yet the necessity of the times follow∣ing, destitute of these helps, might enforce it. Seeing then God hath no lesse care for the propaga∣tion and continuance of his Church, then for the first setling or planting of it: (Eph. 4. 13.) it must needs follow, that this power was not personall in the Apo∣stles, as tyed to them only, but a power given to the Church; and in them for their times resident (but not
ending with them, as temporary) but common to the ages after and continuing (to whom it was more needfull then to them) to represse schisme and to re∣medy other abuses. So that the very same power at this day remai∣neth in the Church; and shall to the Worlds end. Of the PERSONS,[that exe∣cuted these Offices.] I. ALbeit the Commission were generall over all Nations, which was given to the XII. yet was that generality only by permission, not expresse man∣datory. Else should they have sinned that went not through all Nations. Therefore howsoever the Commission was to all Nations: yet was it left to their discretion, how and in what sort they would dispose themselves, as the Holy Ghost should direct them. So that the partition, Gal. 2. 9. betwixt S. Peter and S. Paul, was lawfull and good, and no wayes de∣rogatory to Ite, praedicate. [Goe, teach all nations.] Further, the Ecclesiasticall History doth testify, that they parted the Coasts and Countries of the world among them by common advise: and so seve∣red themselves; Peter, to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia. Iohn, to Asia, Parthia. Andrew, to Scythia, [Pontus] Euxinus and By∣zantium.
Philip, to upper Asia, and to Hierapolis. Thomas, to India, Persia and the Magi. Bartholmew, to Armenia, Lycaonia, India i∣terior. Matthew, to Aethiopia. Simeon, to Mesopotamia, Persia, Aegypt, A∣frique, Britany. Thaddaeus, to Arabia, Idumaea, Mesopotamia. Matthias, to Aethiopia. II. Againe, albeit their preaching was for the most ambulatory: yet doe the same Histories witnesse, that having setled Religion, and brought the Church to some stay; toward their end they betook themselves to residence in some one place, diverse of them. as, S. Iames at Ierusalem. (Euseb. lib. 2. cap. 1. Epi∣phan. haer. 66. Hierome.) S. Iohn at Ephesus. (Euseb. lib. 3. cap. 26. Tertul∣lian. lib. 4. contra Marcion. Hierome.) S. Peter, first at Antioch; and after at Rome. Which places were more especially accompted their Sees: and the Churches themselves, after a more especiall manner, were called Apostolick. Sedes Apostolorum. Augustin. epist. 42. Ecclesiae Apostolicae, Tertullian. III. Thirdly, it is also plaine, that the Apostles chose unto them as Helpers () divers, who were com∣panions with them in their journies, ministred unto them, & supplyed their absence in diverse Churches, when they themselves were occasioned to depart.
Such were: Apollos. (Act. 19.1. 1. Cor. 3.6.) Aquila. (Rom. 16.3.) Archippus. (Philem. 2. Colos. 4. 17.) Aristarchus. (Act. 20.4.) Clemens. (Phil. 4.3.) Crescens. (2. Tim. 4.10.) Demetrius. (3. Iohn. 12.) Epaphras. (Colos. 4.12. & 1.7. & Philem. 24.) Epaphroditus. (Ph. 2.23.) Epaenetus. (Rom. 16.5.) Erastus. (Act. 19.22.) Gaius. (Act. 20.4.) Iesus Iustus. (Col. 4.11.) Iohn Mark. (Act. 13.5. & 15.37. & Philem. 24.) Lucas. (Philem. 24. Col. 4.14.) Secundus. (Act. 20.4.) Silvanus. (1. Pet. 5. 12. 1. Thess. 1. 1. 2. Thess. 1.1.) Sopater. (Act. 20.4.) Sosthenes. (1. Cor. 1.1.) Stephanas. (1. Cor. 16. 15.) Timotheus. (Act. 19.22. & 20.4.) Titus. (2. Cor. 8.23.) Trophimus. (Act. 20.4.) Tychicus. (Act. 20.4.) Vrbanus. (Rom. 16.9.) Of whom, Eusebius, lib. 3. Hist. cap. 4. Euthy∣mius, in tertium Iohannis; Isidorus, de Patrib. and Dorothei Synopsis. To two of these, Timothy and Titus, the one at Ephesus the other at Crete, (Euseb. lib. 3. cap. 4.) the Apostles imparted their owne Commission, while they yet lived, even the chiefe authority they had. To appoint Priests. (Tit. 1.5. & Hieron. in eum locū. To ordaine them by imposition of hands. (1. Tim. 5.22. 2. Tim. 2.2.) To keep safe and preserve the Depositum. (1. Tim.
6.14, 20.2. Tim. 1.14.) To command not to teach other things. (1. Tim. 1.3. Tit. 3.9.2. Tim. 2.16.) To receive Accusations. (1. Tim. 5.19, 21.) To redresse or correct things amisse. (Tit. 1.5.) To reject young Widowes. (1. Tim. 5.11.) [To censure Hereticks and disordered persons, Tit: 1.11. and] 3.10.1. Tim: 6.5.2. Tim. 3.5. And these, after the Apostles deceased, succeeded them in their charge of Government, which was or∣dinary, successive and perpetuall: their extraordinary guifts of miracles and tongues ceasing with them. [So] Irenaeus, lib. 3. cap. 3. Quos & successores relin∣quebant; suum ipsorum locum Magisterii tradentes. [Of the promiscuous use of their NAMES.] These were they whom posterity called Bishops. But in the beginning, regard was not had to distin∣ction of Names. The authority and power was ever di∣stinct: the name not restrained, either in This, or O∣ther. The Apostles were called Priests or Seniors. (1. Pet. 5.1.) Deacons or Ministers. (1. Cor. 3.5.) Teachers or Doctors. (1. Tim. 2.7.) Bishops or Overseers. (Acts 1.20.) Prophets. (Acts 13.1. Revel. 22.9.) Evangelists. (1. Cor. 9.16.)
The name of Apostle was enlarged, and made com∣mon to more then the XII. To Barnabas. (Act. 14.4, 14..) Andronicus. (Rom. 16.7.) Epaphroditus. (Phil. 2. 25.) Titus and others. (2. Cor. 8.23.) Timothy. (Hieron in Cant. Chr. Euseb.) The Priests were called Prophets. (1. Cor. 14.32.) Bishops. (Philip. 1.1. Tit. 1.7.) So Chrysostom, in Philip. 1.[Quid hoc? an unius civitatis multi erant episcopi? Nequaquàm: sed Presbyteros isto nomine appellavit. Tune e∣nim nomina adhuc erant communia.] Hierome: Hîc episcopos Presbyteros intelligimus; non enim in unâ urbe plures Episcopi esse potu∣issent. Theodoret: Non fieri quidem poterat, ut multi E∣piscopi essent unius civitat is pastores; quo fit, ut essent soli Presbyteri, quos vocavit Episcopos. & in 1. Tim. 3. Eosdem olim vocabant Episcopos & Presbyteros: eos autem qui nunc vocantur Episcopi, nominabant Apostolos. Oecumnius: Non quòd in unâ civitate multi es∣sent Episcopi, &c. For in the Apostles absence in Churches new planted, the oversight was in them; till the Apostles ordai∣ned and sent them a Bishop, either by reason of some schisme or for other causes. The Bishops (as the Ecclesiasticall History recoun∣teth
them) were called Apostles. (Philip. 2.25.) Evangelists. (2. Tim. 4.5.) Diaconi. (1. Tim. 4.6.) Priests. (1. Tim. 5.17.) [For it is plaine by the epistle of Irenaeus to Victor, in] Eusebius, lib. 5. cap. 26. that they at the begin∣ning were called Priests, that in very truth and pro∣priety of speech were Bishops. And by Theodoret [in 1. Tim. 3.] that they which were Bishops, were at the first called Apostles. The name , saith Suidas, was given [by the Athenians to them which were sent to oversee the Cities that were under their jurisdiction. . Suid. in .] The name Episcopus was given among the Romans to him, qui praeerat pani & vaenalibus ad victum quo∣tidianum. ff. de munerib. & honorib. Cicero, ad Atticum lib. 7. epist. 10. Vult me Pom∣peius esse, quem tota haec Campania & maritima ora ha∣beat Episcopum. The name in Hebrew  Gen. 41.34. see∣meth to have relation to the second use. for they were such as had charge of the graine laying up, and selling under Ioseph.
[The necessary use of the BISHOPS office, and the charge commit∣ted to him.] The party, who in the New Testament is called E∣piscopus, is in the Old called  (Psal. 109.8. with Act. 1.20.) In a house or familie, it is first affirmed of Ioseph, Gen. 39.4, who had the oversight and government of the rest of the servants. In a house there may be many servants, which have places of charge: but there is one that hath the charge of all; that is, Oeconomus, the Steward. So doe the Apostles terme thēselves. (1. Cor. 4.1.) and their office. (1. Cor. 9.17.) and their successours the Bishops. (Tit. 1.7.) Vid. Hilar. in Matth. 24.45. In a flock, the Pastour. (Ioh. 21.15. Act. 20.28. Mat. Vid. iero∣nym. epist. 4. ad Rusticum (cap. 6.) & epist. 8. ad Evagrium. 25.32.1. Pet. 5.2. Ephes. 4.11.) In a Camp, the Captaine. (Matth. 2.6. Hebr. 13.7, 17, 24.) In a ship, the Governour: (1. Cor. 12.28.) under whom others. (Act. 13.5.) In the Common-wealth, they be such as are set over Officers, to hasten them forward, and see they doe their duties. as in 2. Chron. 34.12. and 31. 13. Nehem. 11.22. and 12.42. So that, what a Steward is in a house,
a Pastour in a flock, a Captaine in a Camp, a Master in a ship, a Surveiour in an office: That is a Bishop in the Ministerie. Upon him lieth, [to take care of the Churches un∣der him.] 2. Cor. 11.28. Philip. 2.20.1. Pet. 5.2. Concil. Antiochen. can. 9. [and for that end to visit them.] Act. 9.32. and 15.36. [and to be ob∣servant] Of that which is Well and orderly; [to confirme it.] Act. 15.41. Revel. 3.2. Otherwise; [to redresse it.] Tit. 1.5. To him was committed; 1. Authority of ordeyning: (Tit. 1.5.) and so of begetting Fathers. (Epiph. haeres. 75.) See Ambrose, Theodoret and Oecumenius, in 1. Timoth. 3. Damasus, epist. 3. Hierome, epist. 85. ad Evagr. Leo, epist. 88. Concil. Ancyran. can. 12. al. 13. For though S. Paul should mention a Companic with him at the ordeyning of Timothie: (1. Tim. 4.14.) yet it followeth not, but that he onely was the Ordeyner. No more, then that Christ is the onely Iudge: although the XII. shall sit with him on Thrones. (Luc. 22.30.) II. Authority of enjoyning or forbidding. (1. Tim. 1.3. Ignat. ad Magnesian. Cyprian. epist. 39.) III. Authority of holding Courts, and receiving accusations. (1. Tim. 5.19.1. Cor. 5.12. Revel. 2.2. Augustin. de opere monachor. cap. 29.) IV. Authority of correcting. (1. Tim. 1.3. Tit.
1.5. Hieron. contra Lucifer. cap. 4. & epist. 53. ad Ri∣parium. Cyprian. ep. 38. ad Rogatianum.) V. Authority of appointing Fas. (Tertullian advers. Psychicos.) FINIS.
