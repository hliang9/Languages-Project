Oxford Riddle. THere dwells a People on the Earth, That reckons true Alleagiance Treason, That makes sad Warre a holy mirth, Calls madnesse Zeale, and nonsence Reason; That findes no Freedome but in slavery, That makes Lyes truth, Religion Knavery, That Rob and Cheat with yea and nay, Riddle me, Riddle me, what are they? That hate the flesh, yet firke their Dames, That make Kings great by curbing Crownes, That quench the fire, by kindling flmes, That settle Peace, by Plundring Townes, That govern with implicite Votes, That stablish truth, by cutting throats, That kisse their Master, and betray, Riddle me, riddle me, who are they? That make Heaven speake by their Commission, That stop Gods Peace, and boast his power, That teach bold Blasphemy and Sedition, And pray high Treason by the houre,
