In this cyte is the palays and sege of the grete Chane in a full fayre place & grete of whyche the walles about is two myle / & within that are many fayre places & in the gardeyne of that palays is a ryghte grete hyll on the whiche is an other palays / and i s the fayrest that may be founde in ony plade / and all a∣boute y• hylle are many trees berynge dyuers fruy∣tes / & aboute that hylle is a grete dyche / and there nere are many vyuers on eche syde / and in those are many wylde foules that he may take & go not out of the palays: Within the halle of that palays are
xxiiij. pylers of golde / and all the walles are coue∣red with ryche skynnes of beestes that men calle pauters. Those are fayre beestes and well smellyn¦ge & of the smell of the skynnes one euyll smelle may come to the palays / those skynnes are as reed as blode / & they shyne so agayne the sonne y• vne∣thes may en beholde them / and en prayse those skynnes as moche as it were colde. In myddes of that palays is a place made yt they call the moun∣ture for the grete Chane that is well made with precyous stones & grete perles hangynge aboute / & at the four corners of that mountour are four ned¦ders of golde / & vnder that mountour & aboue are conduytes of beuerage that they drynke in the em∣perours courte. And the halle of that palays is ry∣chely dyghte & well / And fyrste at the ouer ende of the hall is the throne of the Emperoure ryght hye where he sytteth at mete at a tabe ye is well bordu¦red with golde / & that bordure is full of precyous stones & grete perles / and the greces on the whiche he gooth vp are of dyuerse precyous stones bordred wt golde. At the left syde of his throne is the syege of his wyfe a degre lower than he sytteth & that is of Iasper bordured with golde / & the syege of his se¦conde wyfe is a degree lower than the fyrste & that is also of good Iasper bordured with golde / and the syege of the thyrde wyfe is a degree lower than the seconde / for alwaye he hath thre wyues with hym where soeuer he is / besyde thyse wyues on the
same syde sytteth other ladyes of his kynne echone lower than other as they are of degree / & all those that are wedded haue a counterfayte of a mannes fote vpon theyr hedes a cubyte longe & al made wt precyous stones / and aboue they are made with shy¦nynge feders of pecockes or suche other in token ȳ∣ge that they are subgeccyon of man and vnder mē fote / and they that are not wedded haue none su∣che. And on the ryght syde of the Emperoure syt∣teth fyrste his sone that shall be Emperoure after hym / and he sytteth also a degree lower than̄e the Emperoure in suche maner of seges as the Empe¦roure sytteth / & by hym sytteth other lordes of his kynne echone lower than other as they are of de∣gre.

And vnder the Emperours table sytteth foure clerkes at his fete that wryteth al yt the Emperour sayth be it good or ylle. And at grete festes aboue the Empe∣rours table & all other tables in the halle is a vy∣e made of fyne golde y• gooth all aboute the hall & it hath many braūches of grapes lyke to grapes of the vyne / some are white / some are yelowe / so∣me reed / some grene / and some blacke / all the reed are of rubyes of cremas or alabaūce / the whyte are of crystale or byrall / the yelowe are of topaces / the grene are of emeraudes & crysolytes / & the blacke

And ye shall vnderstande y• my felowe & I was in sou∣dy with hym .xvi. monethes agayne the kynge of Mancy vpon whome he made warre / & the cause was for we had so grete desyre to se the nobley of his courte yf it were suche as we herde speke of / & forsoth we foūde it more rycher & solempne than euer we herde speke of / & we sholde neuer haue by¦leude it had we not seen it / but ye shall vnderstan∣de y• mete & drynke is more honest amonge vs than it is in those coūtrees / for all the comons ete vpon skynnes of beestes on theyr knees & ete but flesshe of all maner bestes / & whan they haue all eten they wype theyr hondes in theyr skyrtes & they ete but ones on the daye & ete but lytell brede / but the esta∣te of the lordes is full nobley & full rychely.
¶Wherfore that the Emperuor of Cathay is cal¦led the grete Chane. ca.lxviij. ANd ye shall wete why he is called the gre∣te Chane / ye wote well that all the worlde was destroyed with Noes flood but Noe & his wyf & his childern. Noe had thre sones Sen Cham and Iapheth. Cham was he yt sawe his faders baloc∣kes naked whan he slepte & scorned it / and therfore was he cursyd / and Iapheth couered it agayne. Thyse thre brethern had all the londe. Cham to∣ke the best parte eestwarde y• is called Asia. Sem toke Affryke / & Iapheth to Europe. Cham was the myghtyest & rychest of his brethern / & of hym are come the paynem folke & dyuers maner of men of the yles / some hedles / & other men dysfygured / & for this Cham the Emperour there called hym Cham & lorde of all. But ye shal vnderstande that the Emperour of Cathay is called Chane & not Cham / and for this cause it is not longe gone yt all Tartary was in subgeccyon & thrall to other na∣cyons about / & they were made herdemen to kepe beestes / & amonge theym was .vij. lynages or kyn∣des / the fyrst was called Tartary ye is the best / the seconde lynage is called Tanghot / the thyrde Eu¦race / the fourthe Valayre / the fyfthe Semoth / the sixth Menchy / the seuenth Sobeth. Thyse are all holdynge of the grete Chane of Cathay. Now it befell so yt in the fyrst lynage was an olde man &
he was not ryche & men calle hȳ Changyus. This man laye & slepte on a nyght in his bedde / & there came to hym a knyght all whyte syttynge vpon a whyte hors & sayd to hym. Chane slepest thou / god that is almyghty sente me to the / & it is his wyll y• thou saye to the .vij. lynages yt thou shalt be theyr Emperour / for ye shall conquere all the londes y• are about you & they shall be in your subgeccyon as ye haue be in theyrs. And whan morowe came he rose up & sayd it to the .vij. lynages / and they scorned hym & sayd he was a fole. And the nyght after the same knyght came to the .vij. lynages & badde theym of goddes behalf to make Changyus theyr Emperour & they sholde be out of all subgec¦cyon. And on the morowe they chose Changyus to Emperour & dyde hym all worshyp yt they myght do & called hym Chane as the whyte knyght cal∣led hym / and they sayd they wolde do as he badde theym. Than he made many statutes & lawes the whiche he called Ysakan. The fyrste statute was that they sholde be obedyent to god almyghty / & byleue y• he sholde delyuer theym out of thraldom / & y• they sholde calle on hȳ in all theyr werkes. An other statute was that all men y• myght bere armes sholde be nombred & to eche .x. sholde be a mayster & to an hondred a mayster / & to a thousande a may¦ster. Than he cōmaūded to all the grettest & pryn¦cypalest of the .vij. lynages that they sholde for∣sake all that they hadde in herytage or lordshyp /
and that they sholde holde theym payed of that he wolde gyue theym of his grace / and they dyde so And also he badde theym y• eche man sholde bryn∣ge his eldest sone before hym and slee his owne so∣ne with his owne handes and smyte of theyr heedes and as soone they dyde his byddynge. And whan he sawe they made no lettynge of yt he badde theym do / than badde he theym folowe his baner / & than he put in subgeccyon all the londes about hym. ¶How the grete Chane was hydde vnder a tree & so scaped his enmyes by cause of a byrde. ca.lxix. ANd it befelle on a daye that the Chane ro¦de with a fewe men to se the londe that he hadde wonne & he mette with a grete multytude of his enmyes and there he was cast downe of his hors and his hors slayne. And whan his men sawe hym at the erthe they wende he had be deed / & fled and the enmyes folowed after / and whan he sawe his enmyes were ferre he hydde hym in a busshe. for the wood was thycke there / and whan they were come agayn fro the chass they wente to seke amon¦ge the wood yf ony were hydde there / & they foūde many. And as they came to ye place where he was they sawe a byrde sytte vpon a tree the whiche byr¦de men calle an oule / & than sayd they y• there was no man for that byrde sate there & so wente they a∣waye / & thus was the Chane saued fro deth / & so
he wente awaye on a nyght to his owne men whi¦che were gladde of his comynge. And fro that ty∣me hyderwardes men of that coūtree haue do gre¦te worshyp to that byrde & for that cause they wor¦shyp that byrde aboue all the byrdes of the worlde And than he assembled all his men & rode vpon his enemyes & destroyed theym. And whan he had wonne all the londes that were about hym he het∣de them in subgeccyon. And whan the Chane had wonne all the londes to mount Belyan / the whyte knyght come to hym in a vysyon agayne & sayd vnto hym. Chane the wyll of god is that thou pas¦se the moūt Belyan and thou shalt wynne many londes / & for thou shalt fynde no passage go thou to moūt Belyan that is vpon the see syde & knele ix. tymes theron agaynst the eest in the worshyp of god & he shall shewe the a waye how thou shalt passe / & the Chane dyde so / and anone the see that touched the hylle withdrowe hym and shewed hym a fayre waye of .ix. foot brood bytwene the hylle and the see / and so he passed ryght well with all his men and than he wanne the londe of Cathay that is the moost londe and the grettest of all the worlde / and for those .ix. knelynges & the .ix. foot of waye the Chane and the men of Tartary haue the nombre of .ix. in grete worshyp. ¶Of the grete Chanes letters and the wrytynge aboute his seale. ca.lxx.
ANd whan he had wonne the londe of Ca∣thay he deyed & than regned after Cytho¦co the eldest sone of Chane / and his other broders wente to wynne theym londes in other coūtrees / & they wanne the londe of Pruysse & of Russy / and they dyde calle themself Chane / but he of Cathay is the grete Chane and the grettest lorde of all the worlde / & so he called hȳ in his letters & sayth th{us}. Chan fili{us} dei excelsi vniuersā terrā colenciū sūm{us} im{per}ator & dn̄s dominātiū. That is to say. Chane goddes sone Emperour of all those yt tylle all the londe & lorde of all lordes. And the wrytynge abo∣ue his grete seale is. Deus in celo et chan su{per} terrā ei{us} fortitudo oīm hoīm im{per}atoris sigillū. That is to saye God in heuen Chane vpon erthe his streng¦the the seale of themperour of all men. And y• wry∣tynge about his preuy seale is. Dei fortitudo oīm hoīm ī{per}atoris sigillū. That is to saye. The streng¦the of god seale of the Emperour of all men. And all yf it be so yt they be not crysten yet themperour and the Tartaryns byleue in god almyghty. ¶Of the gouernaunce of the courte of the grete Chane. ca.lxxi. NOw haue I tolde you why he is called the grete Chane. Now shall I telle you of the gouernynge of his courte whan they make grete festes / & he keped four pryncypall festes in the ye∣re /
the fyrst is of his byrth / the seconde whan he is borne to the Temple to be circūcysed / the thyrde is of his ydols whan they begynne to speke / and the fourth whan the ydoll begynneth fyrst to do myra¦cles / & at those tymes he hath men well arrayed by thousandes and by hondredes / & echone wote well what he shall do. For there is fyrst ordeyned foure thousande ryche barons & myghty for to ordeyne the feest & to serue themperour / & all thyse barons haue crownes of golde well dyght with precyous stones & perles / and they are cladde in clothes of golde and camathas as rychely as they may be ma¦de / & they may well haue suche clothes for they are there of lesse pryce than wollen cloth is here. And thyse four thousande barons are departed in four partyes / & eche company is clad in dyuerse colour ryght rychely / & whan ye fyrst thousande is passed & hath shewed theym / than come the seconde thou¦sande / & than the thyrde thousande / and than the fourth & none of theym speketh a worde. And on one syde of themperours table sytteth many phy∣losophres of many scyences / some of astronomy / nygromancy / geometry / pyromacy / & other many scyences / & some haue before theym astrolabes of golde or of precyous stones full of sonde or of co∣les brennynge / some haue orloges well dyght & ry¦chely & other many Instrumentes after theyr scyen¦ces / & at a certayne houre whan they se tyme they saye to men ye stande before theym make peas / and

And ye shall vnderstande yt men dyght no thynge / clothes / bre∣de / drynke / nor none suche thynges to themperour but at certayne houres that the phylosophres telle & yf ony man reyse warre ayenst that Emperour in what countree so it be thyse phylophres wote it soone & tell the Emperour or his counseyll / and he sendeth men thyder for he hath many men. And
he hath many men to kepe byrdes as garfaukons sperhaukes / faucons / gentyls / laners / sacres / po¦pyniayes that are spekynge & many other .x. thou∣sande olyfaūtes / baboynes / marmosettes & other / & he hath euer about hym many physycyens more than two hondred that are crysten men and .xx. sa¦rasyns / but trusteth more in crysten men than in sarasyns. And there is in that coūtree many ba¦rons & other seruaūtes that are crysten & conuer∣ted to the good fayth thorugh prechynge of good crysten men that dwelle there / but there are many that wyll not that men wete that they are crysten. ¶Of the grete rychesse of this Emperour and of his dyspendynge. ca.lxxij. THis Emperour is a grete lorde for he may dyspende what he wyll without nombre / by cause he spended nother syluer nother golde / & he made no money but of leder or shynnes / and this same money gooth thorugh all his londe / and of the syluer and golde buylded he his palays. And he hath in his chambre a pyler of golde in the whiche is a Ruby and a carbuncle of a foot longe the whiche lyghteth all his chambre by nyght / and he hath many other prycyous stones & rubyes but this is the moost. This Emperour dwelleth in the somer towardes the North in a cyte that men calle Saydus and there it is colde ynough / and in the
wynter he dwelleth in a cyte that men calle Cama∣lache and there it is ryght hote / but for the moost parte is he to Cadon that is not ferre thens. ¶Of the ordynaūce of the lordes of themperour whan he rydeth from one coūtree to an other or to warre. ca.lxxiij. ANd whan this grete Chane shall ryde frō one coūtree to an other they ordeyne four hoostes of people / of whiche the fyrste gooth before a dayes Iourney / for yt hoost lyeth at euen where the Emperour shall lye on the morowe / & there is plene of vytayls. And an other hoost cometh at yt ryght syde of hym and an other at the lyfte syde / & in eche hoost is moche folke. And than cometh ye fourth hoost behynde hȳ a bowe drawght / & there is more men in than in ony of the other. And ye shal vnderstande that the Emperour rydeth on no hors but whan he wyll go to ony secrete place with a pryue meyne where he wyll not be knowen / but he rydeth in a charyotte with four wheles / & there vpon is a chambre made of a tree that men calle lignū aloes that cometh out of Paradyse terrestre & that chambre is couered with plates of fyne gol¦de and precyous stones & perles / and four olyfaū∣tes & foure oxen all whyte gone there in. And fyue or sixe grete lordes ryden about hym so that none other men shall come nere hym but yf the Empe∣rour
calle ony. And in that same maner with cha¦ryotte & suche hoostes rydeth the Empresse by an other syde / & the Emperours eldest sone on the sa¦me aray / and they haue so moche people that it is a grete meruayll for to se. ¶How the Empyre of the grete Chane is depar∣ted in to .xij. prouynces / and how that they do cast ensence in the fyre where the grete Chane passeth thorugh the cytees and townes in worshyp of the Emperour. ca.lxxiiij. THe londe of the grete Chane is departed in .xij. prouynces / & eche prouynce hath more than two thousande cytees & townes. Also whan themperour rydeth thrugh the coūtree / & he passeth thrugh cytees & townes / eche man maketh a fyre before his hous & casteth therin ensence and other thynges yt gyue good smell to themperour. And yf ony men of relygyon yt are crysten dwelle nere as themperour cometh they mete hym with processyon with a crosse & holy water / & they synge Veni crea¦tor spiritus with a loude voyce. And whan he see theym come he cōmaundeth the lordes yt ryde nere hym to make waye yt the relygyous men may co∣me to hym / & whan he se that crosse he doth of his hatte that is made of precyous stones & grete per∣les / & yt hatte is so ryche that it is meruayle to telle and than he enclyned to the crosse. And the prelate
of the relygyous men sayth orysons before hym & gyueth hym the benyson with the crosse / & he encly¦neth to the benyson full deuoutly / & than the same prelate gyueth hym some fruyte of the nombre of ix. in a plate of golde as peres or apples or other fruyte / & than the Emperour taketh one therof & the other he gyueth to his lordes / for the maner is suche there that no straūge man shall come before themperour, but he gyue hym somwhat after the olde lawe that sayth. Non accedat in spectu meo inanis. That is too saye. No man come in to my syght ydle. And than the Emperour byddeth thyse relygyous men yt they shall go forth so that men of his hoost defoule theȳ not. And those relygyous men that dwelle where the Empresse or the Em∣perours sone cometh do in the same maner. ¶How that the grete Chane is the myghtyest lor¦de of all the worlde. ca.lxxv. THis grete Chane is the myghtyest lorde of the worlde / for prester Iohan is not so gre¦te a lorde as he / ne the Soudan of Babylon ne the Emperour of Persy. In his londe a man hath an hondred wyues / & some .xl. some more some lesse / & they take of theyr kynne to wyues all saue theyr systers of theyr moders / but theyr systers of theyr faders other wyues they take also / & they take al∣so well theyr stepmoder yf theyr fader be deed / and

They haue plente of al ma¦ner of bestes saue swyne & forsothe they wyll none & they beleue well in god yt made all thynge & yet haue they ydolles of golde & syluer / & to those ydols they offre theyr fyrst mylke of theyr bestes. Yet of other maners of this countree ca.lxxvi. THis Emperour the grete Chane hath thre wynes / & ye pryncypall wyfe was preester Ios doughter. And the people of this countree begynne too do all theyr thynges in the newe mo∣ne / and they worshyp moche the sonne & the mone those men ryde comunely without spores / and they holde it grete synne too breke a bone with an other & to cast mylke on the erthe or other lycoure yt men may drynke. And the moost synne that they may doos to pysse in theyr houses there they dwell / and he that pysseth in his house shall be slayne / and of those synnes they shryue them to theyr prestes / and for theyr penaunce they shal gyue syluer / & the pla¦ce where they haue pyssed shall be halowed / or els may no man come there. And whan they haue do theyr penaunce they shall passe thrugh a fayr fyre or two too make theym clene of theyr synnes. And
they haue eten they wype theyr handes vpon theyr shyrtes for they haue noo table clothes but it be ry∣ghte grete lordes / & whan they haue all eten they put theyr dysshes or doublers not wasshen in y• pot or caudron with flesshe that is lefte whan they ha∣ue eten vnto they wyll ete an other tyme / and ryche men drȳke mylke of mares or asses or other bestes & other beuerage y• is made of mylke & water to∣gyder for they haue neyther wyne ne ale.

And yf he bydde that ony he slayne he shall be slayne / And they answere all with one voyce / all that ye bydde shall be done. Than sayth y• Emperour fro nowe forth my wordes shall cutte as my werde / & than they sette hym in a chayr & crowne hym / and than all the good townes theraboute sende to him presentes so moche that he shal haue more than .C Camels laden with olde & syluer besyde other Ie¦wlles yt he shall haue of lordes of precyous stones & golde wtout nombre / & hors & ryche clothes of ca∣macs & tartaryns and suche other. ¶What coūtrees & kyngdoms lye next to ye londe of Cathay & the frontes therof. ca.lxxix. THis londe of Cathay is in Asye the depe / & this same londe marcheth towarde y• west vpon the kyngedom of Sery the whiche was som¦tyme to one of the thre kynges that wente to seke our lorde in Bethleem / and all those yt come of his kynne are crysten. Thyse men of Tartary drynke no wyne. In the londe of Corosaym that is at the north syde of Cathay is ryght grete plente of good but no wyne / the whiche hath at the eest syde a gre¦te wyldernesse that lasteth more than an hondred Iourneys / and the best cyte of that londe is called
Corosaym & therafter is the londe soo called / and men of this londe are good warryoures & hardy / & therby is the kyngdom of Comayn / this is ye moost & the gretest kyngedom of the worlde / but it is not all Inhabyte / for in one place of that londe is soo grete colde yt noo man may dwell there for colde / & in an her place is grete hete that no man may dwelle there / & there are soo many feyghes that a man wote not on what syde he may torne hym / & in this londe are but fewe trees berynge fruyte. In this londe men lye in tentes & they brenne dounge of bestes for defaute of wood. This londe dyscen∣deth towarde Pruyse & Rossy / and thorugh this lō¦de renneth the ryuer Echell yt is one of the greteste ryuers in the worlde / & it is frosen soo harde euery yere that men fyght thervpon in grete batayles on horse / and fote men more than hondred thousan∣des at ones. And a lytell fro that ryuer is the grete see of Occean that they call Maure / and bytwene this Maure & Caspye is a full strayte passage too go towarde Ynde & therfore kynge Alexander dy∣de make there a cyte that men calle Alexander for to kepe that passage / soo that noo man may passe but yf he haue leue / and nowe is that cyte called Porte de fear / and the pryncypall cyte of Comayn is called sarachys / this is one of y• thre wayes to go in to Ynde / but thrugh this waye may not many men goo but yf it be in wynter. and this passage is called Berbent.

The other is the kyngdom of Persy
& lasteth fro the ryuer of Physon vnto the grete Ar¦mony / & northwarde vnto y• see of Caspy / & south¦warde to the londe of Ynde / & this is a full plente¦uous coūtre & good / and in this londe are thre prȳ¦cypall cytees.

And neuertheles men of the con̄tree thereby saye that they may somtyme here therin the voyce of men & hors whynynge & cockes crowe & they wote well that men dwell there / but they wote not what maner of men / and they saye this darkenesse came thrughe myracle of god that he dyde for crysten men there. For there was a wyc¦ked Emperour that was of Poy / & he was called Saures & he pursued somtyme all crysten men too destroye / & dyde them make sacryfyce to theyr false goddes / and in that countree dwelled many crysten men the whiche lefte all theyr goodes & catelles & rychesse & wolde go in to Grece / & whan they were all in a grete ayn yt is called Megon y• Emperou¦re & his men came to sle y• crysten men / and than y• crysten men al set them vpon theyr knees & prayed

Who so gooth fro Cathay to Ynde. the hyghe & the lowe he shall go thrughe a kyngdom y• men call Cadissen & is a grete londe / there groweth a maner of fruyte as it were gourdes / & whan it is rype men cutte it ason¦der & men fynde therin a beest as it were of flesshe of bone & bloode as it were a lytell lambe without wolle & men ete the beest & the fruyte also and that is a grete meruayl. Neuertheles I sayd to them yt I helde that for no mernayle / for I sayd y• in my coū¦tree are trees that bere fruyte that become byrdes fleynge & they are good to ete / & that y• falleth in water lyued / & tthat that falleth on the erthe deyed & they had grete meruayle of this. In this londe & mani other about there are trees that bere clowes
and nutmygges & canell and many other spyces. And there are vynes that bere so grete grapes that a stronge man shall haue ynoughe to do to bere a cluster of the grapes. In that same londe are the hylles of Caspye that men call Vber / and amonge those hylles are the Iewes of the .x. kyndes enclo∣sed within that men calle Gog and Magog and they may not come out on no syde. There was en¦closed .xxij. kyng{is} with theyr folke y• dwelled bytwe¦ne the hylles of  kynge Alexander cha∣sed theym thyder amonge those hylles / for he tru∣sted for to haue enclosed theym there thorugh wr∣kynge of men but he myght not / & whan he sawe that he mt not he prayed to god that he wolde fulfyll tha he had begonne / & god herde his prayer & enclosed the hylles togyder so yt the Iewes dwell
there as they were locked in / & there is hylles all about them hat at the one syde / & there is the see of Caspye. And some men myght aske / there is a see on one syde why go they not out there / for there to answere I that all yf it be called a see it is noo se / but a stange stondynge amonge hylles / ad it is the gretest stange of all the world / and yf they wente ouer the see they wote not where for too aryue / for they can noo speche but theyr owne. And ye shall vnderstande that the Iewes haue no lawe of theyr owne lawe in all the worlde / but they that dwelle in those hylles / and yet they paye trybute for theyr londe to the quene of Armony. And somtyme it is so that some of the Iewes goo ouer the hylles / but any men may not passe there too gyder for the hylles are so grete & hyghe. Neuerthelesse men saye in that countree there by that in the tyme of Ante∣cryst they shall doo moche harme to crysten men & therfore all the Iewes that dwelle in dyuerse par∣tyes of the worlde lerne for too speke Ebrewe / fo they hope that the Iewes that dwelle amonge the hylles aforesayd shal coe out of the hylles & they speke all Ebrewe & not ell / and than shall thyse Iewes speke Ebrewe to theym & leede theym in to crystendome for to destroye crysten men. For thyse Iewes saye they wote by theyr prophecyes yt those Iewes that are amōge those hylles of Caspy shall come out & crysten men shall be in theyr bgeccōn as they be vnder crysten men. And yf ye wyll wte
how they shall fynde the passage out as I haue vn¦derstande I shall telle you. In tyme of Antecryste a foxe shall make his denne in the same place whe¦re kynge Alexander dyde make the gates & he shall dygge in the erthe so longe tyll he perce it thorugh vnto that he come amonge the Iewes. And whan they se this foxe they shall haue grete meruayle of hym / for they sawe neuer suche beest / for other beestes haue they amonge theym many / and they shall chase this foxe & pursue hym vnto that he be fledde agayne in to his hole that he came fro. And than shall they dygge after as he wente vnto they come to the gates yt Alexander dyde make of grefe stones well dyght with syment / & they shall breke thyse gates & so shall they fynde the yssue. ¶Of the londe of Bactry and of many gryffons and other beestes. ca.lxxxv. FRom this londe men shall go vnto the lon¦de of Bactry where are many wycked men and fell. In that londe are trees yt bere wolle as it were shepe of whiche they make cloth. In this londe are many Ypotaynes that dwelle somtyme on londe / somtyme on water & are halfe man and halfe hors / & they ete not but men whan they may gete theym. In this londe are many gryffons mo¦re than in other places / & some saye they haue the body before as an agle & behynde as a lyon / and
they saye soth for they are made so / but the gryffon hath a body gretter than .viij. lyons and gretter & stalworthyer than an hondred egles. For certaynly he wyll bere to his nest fleynge an hors and a man vpon his backe or two oxen yocked samen as they go at plough / for he hath longe nayles on his feet and grete as it were hornes o oxen / and of those they make cuppes there to drynke of / and of his rybbes they make bowes to shote. ¶Of the waye for to go to prester Iohans londe whiche is Emperour of Ynde. ca.lxxxvi. FRo this londe of Bactry men goo many a dayes Iourney to the londe of prester Iohn that is a grete Emperour of Ynde / and men calle his londe the yle of Pantoxore. This Emperour prester Iohan holdeth grete londe & many good cytees & good townes in his kyngdom / many gre¦te yles & large. For this londe of Ynde is all depar¦ted in yles by cause of grete flodes that come out of Paradyse / & also in the see are many grete yles The best cyte that is in the yle of Pantoxore is cal¦led Nyse / for that is a noble cyte and ryche. Prester Iohan hath vnder hym many kyngee & many dy¦uerse people / and his londe is good and ryche but not so ryche as the londe of the grete Chane / for marchauntes come not so moche thyder as they do in to the londe of the grete Chane for it is to lon¦ge
a waye. And also they fynde in the yle of Ca∣thay all that they haue nede of / as spycery clothes of golde and other rychesse. And all yf they myght haue better chepe in the londe of preester Iohan than in the londe of Cathay and more fyner / ne∣uertheles they wolde lette it for the longe waye & grete peyls in the see / for there are many places in the see where are grete Roches of a stone that is called adamande / the whiche of his owne kyn∣de draweth to hym yron / and for as moche that there sholde passe no shyp that had nayles of yron for it sholde drawe it to hym / therfore they dare not wende in to that countree with shyppes for dre¦de of adamandes. I wente ones in that see and sa∣we as longe as it had ben a grete yle of trees and stockes and braunches growynge / and the shyp∣man sayd to me that those was of grete shyppes that were dwellynge there thorugh the vertue of the adamandes and of thynges that were in the shyppes were those trees sprongen and waxen / and suche Roches are there many in dyuerse places of that see and therfore dare no shypman passe that waye. And an other also that they drede the longe waye / and therfore they goo moost all to Cathay and that is nerer vnto theym. And yet is it not so nere but theym behoueth fro Venys or fro Geene be in see towarde Cathay .xi. or .xij. monethes. The londe of prester Iohn is longe & marchaūtes passe thyder thorugh the londe of Persy and come vnto
a Cyte that men calle Hermes / for a phylosophre that men called hermes foūded it / & they passe an arme of the see & come to an other cyte that men calle Saboth & there fynde they all marchaūdyses & popyniayes as grete plente as larkes in our coun¦tree. In this countree is lytell whete or barley and therfore they ete ryse and mylke & chese and other fruytes. This Emperour prester Iohan weddeth comonly the doughter of the grete Chane and the grete Chane his doughter. In the londe of prester Iohn is many dyuerse thynges & many precous stones so grete & so large that they make of theym vessels platers & cuppes and many other thynges of whiche it were to longe to telle / but som what of his lawe & of his fayth shall I telle you. ¶Of the fayth & byleue of prester Iohan / but he hath not all ye full byleue as we haue. ca.lxxxvij. THis Emperour prester Iohan is crysten & a grete parte of his londe also / but they ha¦ue not all the artycles of our fayth / but they byle¦ue well in the fader & the sone and the holy goost and they are full deuoute & true one to an other / & they make no force of catell / and he hath vnder hym .lxxij. prouynces & coūtrees and in echone is a kynge / & those kynges haue other kynges vnder theym. And in this londe are many meruayles / for in that londe is the grauelly see y• is of sonde & of
grauel & no droppe of water / and it ebbeth and flo∣weth with ryght grete wawes as an other see doth and it is neuer styll ne neuer in rest & no man may passe that londe beyonde it. And all yf it so be that there is no water in yt see / yet men may fȳde there in ryght good fysshe & of other facyon and shape than is in ony other sees / and also they are of full good sauour & swete and good to ete. And at thre Iourneys fro that see are grete hylles thrugh whi¦che renneth a grete flood that cometh fro Parady se and it is full of precyous stones and no drope of water / & it renneth with grete wawes in to the gra¦uelly see. And this flood renneth thre dayes in the weke so fast & stereth grete stones of the rockes wt hym that make moche noyse / & as soone as they come in to the grauelly see they are nomore seen / & in those thre dayes whan it renneth thus no man dare come in it / but the other dayes men may goo therin where they wyll. And also beyonde y• flood towarde the wyldernesse is a grete playne also sn¦dy & grauelly amonge hylles / and in yt playne gro we trees that at the rysynge of the sonne eche daye begynne to growe / & so grewe they to myddaye & bere fruytes but no man dare ete of that fruyte / for it is a maner of yron▪ and after myddaye it torned agayne in to the ethe / so yt whan the sonne gooth downe it is no thynge seen / & so doth it euery daye And there is in yt wyldernesse many wylde men wt hornes on theyr heedes & ryght hydeous / and they
speke not but grunt as swyne. And in that coūtree are many popyniayes that they calle in theyr lan¦gage pystak & they speke thrugh theyr owne kyn∣de as apertly as a man / & those that speke well ha¦ue longe tonges & large & on euery foot fyue toos▪ there are some that haue but thre toos and tho sa∣me speke nought or very lyteli. ¶How the Emperour preester Iohan whan he gooth to batayll hath thre crosses borne before hym of fyne golde. ca.lxxxviij.

Iaspye and crystall & well boūde with golde and perles & other maner of stones / and he had made a conduyte vnder the erthe so yt whan he wolde the walles ranne somtyme with mylke somtyme with wyne somtyme with hony / & this place is called Paradyse. And whan ony yonge bachelere of that countree knyght or squyer cometh to hym for sola∣ce & dysporte / he ledeth hym in to his Paradyse & sheweth vnto hym all thyse dyuerse thynges / & dy¦uerse songes of byrdes and also of his damoysels and his welles / and he dyde stryke dyuerse Instru∣mentes of musyke in an hyghe toure that myght be seen & sayd those were aungels of god / and that plac was Paradyse that god hath graūted to tho¦se that byleued whan he sayd.

And than this ryche man dyde thyse men drynke a maner of dryn¦ke of whiche they were dronken & he sayd to them yf they wolde deye for his sake that whan they we¦re deed they sholde come in to his Paradyse / an they sholde be of the age of those maydens & shol∣de dwelle alwaye with theym / and he sholde put theym in a fayre Paradyse where they sholde se god in his Ioye & in his mageste / and than they graunted to do what he wolde / and he badde them go & slee suche a lorde or a man of the coūtre that he was wroth with / & that they sholde haue no dre¦de of no man / and yf they were slayne themselfe
for his sake he sholde put theym in his Paradyse whan they were deed. And so wente those bache∣lers to slee grete lordes of the countree / and were slayne themselfe in hope to haue that Paradyse / & thus he was auenged of his enemyes thorugh his deserte. And whan ryche men of the countree per∣ceyued this malyce and cautele & the wyll of this Catolonabes they gadred theym togyder & assay∣led the castell and slewe hym and destroyed all his goodes and his fayre places & rychesse that were in his Paradyse / the place of the walles is there yet and some other thȳges / but yt rychesse is not there and it is not longe ago syth he was destroyed. ¶Of a meruaylous vale that is besyde the ryuer of Physon. ca.lxxxxi.

There is a vale bytwene two hylles & that is foure myle longe / and some men calle it the valay enchaunted / some the valey of deuyles / some the valey peryllous / & in that valey are ma∣ny tempestes and a grete noyse and hydeous euery daye and nyght / and somtyme as it were a noyse of Taburynes of akers and of trompettes as it were at a grete feest. This valey is all full of de∣uylles & hath ben alwaye / & men saye there yt it is an entre to helle. In this valey is moche golde and
syluer / wherfore many crysten men & other go thy der for couetyse of that golde & syluer / but fewe of theym come out agayne for they are anone stran∣gled with deuylles / & in myddes of that vale vpon a roche is a vysage & the heed of a fende bodyly ryght hydeous & dredefull to se / & there is no thyn¦ge seen but the heed to the sholders / but there is no crysten man in the worlde no other soo hardy that he ne sholde haue grete drede for to beholde it / for he beholdeth eche man so sharpely & so felly / & his eyen are so sterynge & so sprenkelynge as fyre, and he chaungeth so often his coūtenaūce that no man dare come nere for all the worlde / and out of his mouth & his nose cometh grete plente of fyre of dy¦uerse colours / & somtyme is the fyre so stynkynge that no man may suffre it / but alwaye a good cry∣sten man & that is stable in the fayth may go there in without harme yf they shryue theym well and blysse theym with the token of the crosse than shall the deuylles haue no power of theym. And ye shall vnderstande yt whan my felowes & I were in tha valey we had full grete thought yf we sholde put our bodyes in auenture to go thrugh it / & some of my felowes accorded therto / & some wolde not ac∣corde therto / & there was in our company two fre∣res mynours of Lombardy & they sayd yf ony of vs wolde go in they wolde also / as they had sayd so vpon truste of theym we sayd that we wolde go and we dyde synge a masse & we were shryuen &

ANd beyonde that valey is a grete yle whe∣re people are as grete as geaūtes of .xxviij. foot or .xxx. foot longe / & they haue no clothynge

An o∣ther yle is there northwarde where are many yil & felle women & they haue precyous stones in theyr eyen / & they haue suche kynde yt yf they beholde o∣ny man with wrath they slee theym of the behol∣dynge as the baselyske doth. An other yle is there of fayre folke & good where the custome is suche yt the fyrst nyght yt they are wedded they take a cer∣tayne man that is ordeyned therfore & do hym lye by theyr wyues to haue theyr maydenhede & they gyue hym grete rewarde for his trauayle / & those men are called Gadlybyryem / for men of y• coūtr holde it a grete thynge to make a woman no may¦den / & yf it be so yt the husbonde fynde her a may¦den the next nyght after / for perauenture he that laye by her was dronken or for ony other cause the husbonde shall playne of hym to the lawe that he hath not done his deuoure / & he shall greuously be punysshed & chastysed / but after y• fyrst nyght they kepe theyr wyues well y• ther speke not with those men / & I asked what was the cause why they had
that custome / & they sayd somtyme men laye with theyr wyues fyrst & none other & theyr wyues had serpentes in theyr bodyes & stonged theyr husbonde on theyr yerde & theyr bodyes & so was many man slayne / & therfore had they yt custome to lete other men haue theyr maydenhede for drede of the deth & thus they suffre theym to assaye the passage or they put theym vnto auenture. ¶Of women whiche make grete sorowe as theyr childern are borne and grete Ioye whan they a deed. ca.lxxxxiii. ANd other yle there is where women make grete sorowe whan theyr childern are born & whan they are deed they make grete Ioye & cast theym in a grete fyre & brenne theym / & they yt loue well theyr husbondes whan they are deed they cast theym in a fyre to brenne also / for they saye yt fyre shall make theym clene of all fylth & vyces & they shall be clene in an other wolde / & the cause why they wepe whan theyr childern are born & yt they ma¦ke Ioye at theyr deth / they saye, a childe whan he is borne cometh in to this worlde to haue trauayle & sorowe & heuyne / & whan they are deed they go to paradyse where yuers are of mylke & hony and there is lyf & Ioye & plente of goodes without tra¦uayle and sorowe. In this yle they make theyr kynges by chesynge / and they chee hym not for

Thyse serpentes slee men & ete theym wypēde & they haue no tonge. In this coūtree & many other men cast sede of cotton & so∣we it ech yere & it groweth as it were smalle trees and they berecotton. In Araby is many byrdes / that some men call Gyrsantes that is a full fayre beest and is hygher than a grete courser or a stede but his necke is nere .xx cubytes longe / & his crou∣pe and his tayle is lyke an herte / and he may loke o¦uer an hygh house / & there is many camylyons yt is a lytell beest & he eteth ne drynketh neuer / and he chaungeth often his coloure / for somtyme he is of one coloure & somtyme of an other / & he may chaū¦ge

And there is many other maner of bestes of whome it were to longe for too wryte all. ¶Of an other ylonde where in dwelleth full good people and true. ca.lxxxxv. THere is an other ylonde good and grete and plenteuous where are good men and true & of goodly lyfe after theyr fayth / and all yf they be not crysten. Neuertheles of kynde they are full of good vertues & they fle all vyces and all synne and malyce / for they are not enuyous ne proude ne co∣uytous ne lecherous ne glotenous / and they do not vnto an other man but that they wolde he dyde too them / & they fulfyll the .x. cōmaundementes / and they make no force of rychesse ne of hauynge / and they swere not but saye ye & naye / for they saye he that wereth he wyll dysceyue his neyghbour / and some men call this the yle of Bragamen / & some calle it the londe of fayth / & thorughe it renneth a
grete ryuer that men calle Thebe / and generally all men in those yles & other thereby are truer and ryghtwyser than are in other coūtrees. In this yle are no theues ne murderers ne comune woman ne beggers / and for as moche they are so true and so good that there is no tempest ne thonder ne warre ne hunge ne other trybulacyons / & thus it semeth well that god loued theym well & is well payde of theyr trouth & theyr dedes / and they byleue in god that made all thynge & hym they worshyp & they ly¦ue so ordynatly in mete & drynke yt they lyue ryght longe / & many of theym deye without sykenesse yt kynde faylleth them for aege. ¶How kynge Alexander sent his men thyder for to wynne that londe. ca.lxxxxvi ANd kynge Alexander somtyme sente his men to wynne that londe. And they sente hym lettres that sayd thus. What behoueth a man to haue all the worlde y• is not contente there with / thou shalte fynde no thynge in vs why thou shol∣dest make warre vpon vs / for we haue no rychesse ne tresoure / and all the goodes & catell of our coun¦tree are comune / our metes that we ete are oure ry∣chesse. And in stede of tresoure of golde & syluer we make our tresoure peas & accorde of loue / and we haue nought but a cloth vpon our bodyes / our wy¦ues are not arrayed rychely too pleasynge / for we
holde it a grete fooly a man to dyghe his body to make it to seme fayrer than god made it. We haue ben euermore in peas tyll now that thou wylte dys¦heryte vs. We haue a kynge amonge vs not for ne∣de of the lawe ne to deme no man / fo  are no trespassours amonge vs but all on ( to be obedyent to hym / and soo mayste  not take from vs but our good peas. And whan kynge Alex¦ander sawe this lettre / hȳ thought al thus yt he shol¦de do to moche harme yf he troubled them & sent to theym y• they sholde kepe well theyr good maners & haue no drede of hym. ¶Of an other ylonde where also dwelleth good pe¦ople in & is called Synople. ca.lxxxxvij. THan is there an other ylonde that is called Synople where in also are good people & trewe and full of good fayth / and they are moche lyke in theyr lyuynge to the men before sayd / and they go all naked. And in to that ylonde came kyn¦ge Alexander. And whan that he sawe theyr good faythe and trouthe and theyr good byleue / he sayd that he sholde doo to theym noo harme / and badde theym aske of hym rychesse and nought elles and they sholde haue it. And they answered that they hadde ryches ynoughe whan they hadde mete and drynke to susteyne theyr bodyes / and they sayd also that rychesse of this worlde is nought worth but yf
it were so that he myght graunte theym that they sholde neuer deye that wolde they praye hym. And Alexander sayd y• myght he not do for he was de∣dely and sholde dey as they sholde. Than sayd they why art yu so proude & wolde wynne all the worlde & haue in thy subgeccyon as it were a god & yu hast no terme of thy lyf / and yu wylt haue all rychesse of the worlde the whiche shall forsake the or yu forsa∣ke it / & yu shalt bere no thynge with the / but it shal dwelle to other / but as yu was borne naked so shalt yu be done in erthe. And Alexander was gretly asto¦nyed of this answere / & yf it be so y• they haue not the artycles of our fayth / neuertheles I byleue that god loueth theym well & theyr good entencyon & yt he taketh theyr seruyce to gree as he dyde of Iob yt was a paynym the whiche he helde for his true seruaūt & many other. I byleue well yt god loueth all those y• loue hym & serue hym mekely & truly & yt despyse the vayne glorye of the worlde as thyse en do & as Iob dyde / and therfore sayd our lor¦de thorugh the mouth of Ysaye the prophete thus. Ponā eis multiplices leges meas. That is to saye I shall put to theym my lawes in many maners / & the gospell sayth thus. Alias oues habeo que nō sūtex hoc ouili. That is to saye. I haue other she pe y• are not of this folde / and there to accordeth the vysyon that Saynt Peter sawe at Iaffe how the angell came fro heuen & brought with hym of all maner of beestes as serpentes & foules in all maner
and sayd to saynt Peter. Take & ete. And saȳt Pe¦ter answered. I ete neuer of vnclene beste. And the aūgell sayd to hym. Non das īn. unda q̄deus mū¦dauit. That is to saye. Calle thou not those thyn∣ges vnclene that god hath clensed. This was do∣ne in token that men sholde not haue many men in despyte for theyr dyuerse lawes / for we wote neuer whome god loueth and whome god hateth. ¶Of other two yles yt one is called Pytan wherin be lytel men yt ete no mete / and in that other yle are the men all rough of fethers. ca.lxxxxviii. THere is an other yle that men callle Pytan men of this londe tylle no londe for they ete nought / & they are smale men but not so smale as Pygmeens. Thyse men lyue with smell of wyl de apples / & whan they go ferre out of the countree they bere apples wt theym / for anone as they lese y• sauour of apples they deye / they are not resonable but as it were bestes. And there is an other yle whe¦re the people are all fethers but the face & the pal∣mes of theyr hondes. Thyse men go as well aboue these as on the londe & they ete flesshe & fysshe all rawe.

In this londe is many olyfaū¦tes all whyte & blewe without nombre / and vny∣cornes and lyons of many maners. Many other yles are in the londe of prestes Iohan that were to longe to telle & moche rychesse and nobley of pre∣cyous stones in grete plente. I byleue that we haue herde saye why this Emperous is called preester Iohan / but for those that wote it not I shall saye There was somtyme an Emperour that was a noble prynce & doughty / and he had many crysten knyghtes with hym / and the Emperour thought he wolde see the maner of seruyce in crysten chir∣ches & than was chirches of crystendom in Turky Surry & Tartary Ierusalem Palestyn Araby & Alapy & all the londes of Egypt. And this Empe¦rour came with a crysten knyght in to a chirche of Egypt & it was on a saterdaye after Wytsondaye whan the bysshop made ordres / and he behelde the
seruyce & he asked of the knyght what folke those sholde be yt stode before the bysshop / & the knyght sayd they sholde be preestes & he sayd he wolde no more be called kynge ne Emperour but preest & he wolde haue the name of hym yt came fyrst out of the preestes / & he was called Iohan & so haue all the Emperours sythen be called preester Iohan. In that londe are many crysten men of good fayth & good lawe / and they haue preestes to synge masse and they make y• sacrament as men of Grece do but they saye not so many thynges as or prestes do for they saye not but yt the apostles sayd as saȳt Peter & saynt Thomas and other apostles whan they ange masse & sayd Pater n. And the wordes with the whiche goddes body is sacred / we haue many addycyons of popes that haue ben ordeyned of whiche men of those coūtrees knowe not. ¶Of a grete ylonde and kyngedom called Ta∣probane. ca.C.
