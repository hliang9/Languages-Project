Knavery in all Trades. Or, the Coffee-House. ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Froth, Rasy, and Smoake. Froth. I Have made an escape as hard as one of Iupiters to see thee, Rasy; The heat of our morning business is over; and now my Stomack's more raw and cold then the weather; therefore prithee one half Pint of the best, if thou lov'st me. Rasy. I know thy meaning, thou shalt have it Lad in a pint Pot. Exit. Smoake. An honst Rogue I warrant him. Froth. Here can I drink at any time a Pint of Sack would make a Cat speak Greek or Hebrew for a Groat.
Smoake. 'T must be thy Grandams groat, then. Froth. A good plain Harry, or a Besses do'st, or any Coyne will tantamount to four-pence. Smoake. How, man? Froth. True man; there's an Art in't will puzel all the Poets and Legerdemane—men living. A friend in a corner is as good as a penny in a man's Purse, I need say no more. Smoake. 'Tis good, to be acquainted with such a friend. Froth. Creep e're you go; deserve him first, every man is not Froth, I nick you there; one courtesie requires another, so much for that, ka me, ka thee. Enter Rasy. Rasy. Score a pint of White-Wine in the Rose there. Smoake. White-Wine! we call'd for Sack. Froth. Pass by his Ignorance; friend hast thou a Pallat? here's to thee. Smoake. By all the Wares in my Master's shop, and my Mistresses Compter too, excellent Sack. Rasy. Hold your peace, cannot you fare well, but you must cry Roast-meat? Froth. This Smoak is such a vapour. Smoake. Are you for a Pipe? I have right speciall in my Box. Froth. Would choak a Dog I warrant it. Smoake. The best Spain affords I promise you. Froth. I care not if I take a whiffe,—what say'st thou Rasy? Rasy. I dare not, 'tis too soon, come, mind your drinking, one Quart more, that's pint a piece, and we have done. Froth. Gramercy, honest Rasy; and so have at thee. Smoake. Bring a Light, and Pipes too. Rasy. Well, I shall. Exit Rasy. Froth. Now sirrah, say I've brought you acquainted with a trusty Trojan, one that does prize his friend, that's such as I am, that scornes to be behind hand in requital. If thou wilt be of our Society, then study that. Smoake. By this hand thou know'st I am as prodigall of my Master's Goods as another can be of his; If I can serve Rasy in any thing relates to our Trade he shall command me. Froth. why, that's well said; I'le tell him so.
Smoak. Pray do, I warrant him a witty fellow: I like his way of scoring White-Wine for Sack, 'tis ingenious, & undiscoverable. Froth. Unless the Master come into the Room, and smell into the Pot. Smoak. That's but a hazard, and care must mannage it. Froth. Thou dost inspect well. Smoak. I am not ignorant of good fellowship Froth; and have been at the like sport in the City, when the visible Pint of Sack has past the Barr, and the merry quart Bottle by cleanely convey∣ance brought in the Breeches, & dedicated to good fellows; & now & then (as the house fills, and Company resolv'd to stay,) a Quart scor'd in the Crown and brought to us in the Myter, for which the elevated Gentlemen pay, and we pass upon Paroll, that is, to return again, and be merry upon the like accompt; and these are kindnesses I meet withall. Froth. And how dost thou requite 'em. Smoak. Know Froth, I hate to be ingrate, I will not boast my doing; but while my master has Rasons, Currans, Figs, Sugar, Nutmeg, Cloves, all sorts of Spices and Tobacco, they shall march in Pounds and Ounces to my friends, Lads. Enter Rasey. Froth. Thou wilt deserve us then; come sprightly Rasey, we thirst for thee. Rasey. As I'm a Christian the bst Gentlemen comes to the house tasts not better; and so my love to you. Froth. Thou dost well, here's one that would be one of us, and though I say it an intelligible puppy, one will come to hand upon a good occasion; Mr. Pepper's man the Grocer. Rasey. How do you call him Gynney? Froth. No Smoak, or what you will, but certainly his proper name is Smoaker, for that the Pipe is ne're out of his mouth; how∣ever he's good natur'd, and true hearted. Rasey. The fitter for our Company. Froth. He swears he is so ta'ne with thine, thou shalt not want any thing his Masters Shop affords. Rasey. I thank ye, Froth knows me well enough. Froth. And thou know'st me well enough Rasey: Rasey. I Rogue, we are brothers.
Smoak. I hope you will intitle me too, and if you want a fourth man, I'le bring one that is true blew, an Oyle-man's Apprentice, who shall furnish you better, and with more variety then he that cryes your Olives, your Capers, your Samphire, your Barbaries, your Cowcumbers, your Anchoves, and your new Pickl'd Oy∣sters, and cost you nothing. Froth. By all means let's know him. Smoak. A kind soul, and will spend his Money freely too. Rasey. Or else he does nothing,—will he Game. Smoak. I never try'd him. Froth. Now thou talk'st of Gaming, what's become of the lit∣tle Dapper Clark, how does he hold out? Rasey. Pox take him, he won four pound of me but t'other day, I hope to retreive it. Smoak. Thou hast only drawn him in. Rasey. No, hang him, were he as good at Clerkship as he is at Gaming, he'd get more Money then his Hide could carry. Smoak. Is he so good at it. Rasey. It is his prayers and his daily bread; and yet I know sometimes he wants a dinner, but that is when his Mint is broke and he wants recruting; for the best of Gamsters does not al∣wayes winne, and then the Rogue will spend high when he has it, Whores a little, and keepes himself neat and trim, fit for good Company. Smoak. By this hand Rasey, now we are Brothers (for I will be so whether thou wilt or no) if thou beest excellent at that sport, I will bring thee acquainted with such a young fry of Apprentices thou shalt want for no Commodities. Froth. By this hand I'le go snip, and so shalt thou. Rasey. Agreed, agreed. Smoak. Why should not we four that is our brother Oyleman, (as yet unknown to you,) our brother Vintner here, our brother Tapster, and Ego my own self, brother to all, love one ano∣ther? the Drapery, and the Mercery Pedees comply to cheat their Masters in gross, to please their Concubines, ('twere Porter like to say Whors,) & we never cheat our Masters but in parcels to please our selves and keep up merry Society, and for ought I know our
Masters are greater Cheats then we are, what say you Brothers. Rasey. A learned speech, you have hit right,— within, why Rasey. I come, I come; the truth on't is I could say something as to our own calling, as to Balme and Shamlee, the merry mixtures, stumings, and sophistications, but it is an ill Bird defiles its own Nest they say; and truly I think it not necessary for a man to discover the adulterations and deceits in his own Calling. Froth. Though we can say something as to our Callings too, 'tis wisdome to hold our peace, the truth on't is, Cheating like the Wandring Iew is every where; but of all cheats I hate your Coffee-House cheat. Rasey. Why a Turk's as bad as a Iew, if not worse. Smoak. For my part I think they are principl'd alike. Rasey. But the vanity of our Nation is such, that rather then we shall cheat'em they'l bring in the divel to do't. Smoak. A Song in three parts, the Iew, the Turk, and the Devil. Froth. Troth Rasey some of your quality are serv'd in their kind, and suffer for their own sinnes, what had they to do to take anothers calling upon them, to sell Ale in silver Tankerds, ordered with Sugar, and a nick name, and sell it for 6d. a Pint, half pint? and then Beer put into a Rhenish Wine Cask and sold for March Beer, strew'd with a little Sugar at a groat a Tankerd, and all to cozen the poor Victualler. Rasey. That my Master was never guilty of. call within Rasey. Froth. I do not say he was. Rasey. I am coming,—howe're I have a plaguy spleen at the Coffee-House that cheats us all. Smoak. No, he cheats not us, we furnish him with Tobacco, and he payes honestly, but still he is but a Turk as the Song goes. Rasey. Would I could meet with some Poet that would handle the Humours of the Coffee-House a little, as I'm a Christian I'd be civil to him. Froth. I know one, Rasey, that does love thee dearly; I must confess he cares not much for me, yet he will take his mornings draught in Ale, to please his company, but Sack is his best mistress, Coffee he abhominates.
Rasey. Prithee bring him hither. Call within, why Rasey. Froth. He has been here, and thou canst not but know him. Rasey. I come, I come,—I am more call'd upon, then any ser∣vant in the house; look you there's my Groat,—pay at the Barr, I'le take the Quart-pot down into the Cellar. Froth. Here's our two Groats, prithee do thee pay the Reckoning. Rasey. I will. Smoak. Deer Rasey I am thy humble servant, by this hand when next we meet I will requite this kindness. Froth. You Rogue I must have a pound of Verina's, for a friend in the mean time. Smoak. Thou shalt have it. Froth. Come go to our house and't shan't cost thee a farthing stay all day. Smoak. I dare not do that. Exeunt. ACT I. SCENE II. Enter Mahoone and his Maid.

Wife. Hang you Raskall. Exeunt severally. ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Hunt-Cliffe, and Mrs. Sweet-Lips. HVnt-Cliffe. How now, where's thy Husband? Sweet-Lips. Gone into the City. Hunt-Cliffe. How has he look'd on thee since he Trapan'd us at Epsome, prithee? Sweet-Lips. With the same eyes he did before, and as lovingly faith la, only sometimes he'l tell me jestingly 'twas a wild frolique in me; and so it was indeed, we might have been far more securely merry neerer hand. Hunt-Cliffe. Do'st think he is not Jealouse? Sweet-Lips. If he be, he shewes it not.
Hunt-Cliffe. How does he speak of me? Sweet-Lips. Very well faith La; he thinks you a right honest man, and shall not loose a penny by ye, he had rather trust you then a hundred Courtiers. Hunt-Cliffe. I believe him, 'tis safer to trust one Man then a Hundred. What wilt thou drink this morning? Sweet-Lips. Any thing. Hunt-Cliffe. A Cup of Hypocras, 'twill warme thee within Wench; come kiss me, poor Rogue dost not want a Course this morning? claps her Cheeks. Sweet-Lips. You talk wildly, you have not slept to night well certainly. Who's at Barr there? within anon, anon. Rasey bring a Cup of Hypocras for Mr. Hunt-Cliffe enter Rasey. here, and make a Toast. Rasey. I shall forsooth. Exit Rasey. Sweet-Lips. I hope dear Hunt-Cliffe you are no friend unto the Coffee-House. Hunt-Cliffe. I hate the Liquor perfectly, give me the Sack, it breeds good Blood. Sweet-Lips. The other is a dryer, a monstrous dryer, and the greatest enemy unto th'affaires relate unto our Sex that can be; if you love me you must hate that, my Husband is too much ad∣dicted to't. Hunt-Cliffe. Let fools, and Sots affect it, Wisemen sleight it. Enter Compound. Compound. Oh Squire Hunt-Cliffe, how fares your body? Hunt-Cliffe. It will fare better by and by, we wait for Wine. Enter Rasey with the Wine and Toast. Sweet-Lips. But new come in I protest my Dear—look thee, the Wine is not toucht yet. Hunt-Cliffe. Come, here's to thee, 'tis Hypocras man. Compound. I care not, I've newly drank Coffee. Hunt-Cliffe. What? an enemy to thy own Calling! Compound. Some two or three hours hence I'm for you: Hunt-Cliffe. I shall Sup here to Night. Sweet-Lips. And welcome too, Sir. Hunt-Cliffe. Some friends of mine are newly come to Town, I am oblig'd to Treat.
Sweet-Lips. What will you have provided sir? Hunt-Cliffe. A douzen of Cocks, and half a douzen of Teale, as many Partridges, and a couple of Pullets, will do the business. Sweet-Lips. They shall be ready sir. Hunt-Cliffe. Twixt six and seven. Compound. I like not things that run at six and sevens. Hunt-Cliffe. I prithee fail me not. Compound. You have my Wife's word for't sir. Hunt-Cliffe. I must to Court about some special business; add this Wine to my Accompt. Exit Hunt-Cliffe. Compound. So—to your Accompt! I think you'l make no Accompt on't, still scoring: I never saw a penny of his Money. Sweet-Lips. He brings good Company to the House, my Dear: Compound. And alwayes scores his part o'th Reckoning; a pretious purchase, what will begot at last by such a Customer? prithee wilt hold out? Sweet-Lips. He'l pay thee all my Dear, I'le warrant it. Compound. Nay, then I'm in a likelihood indeed to be well paid, if you be his Security. Sweet-Lips. Not so neither my Dear; his Money he sayes will come up very shortly. Compound. It has been long a coming, and the truth is, would I could see't once, I have small mind to trust him longer. Sweet-Lips. As you please for that my Dear; but take my word the Gentleman's a very civil Gentleman. Compound. I wish he prove so. Exeunt. Enter Mrs. Fraile, and Smoak. Mrs. Fraile. What, does you Master think to Coope me up in his Counter? faith sir no, he takes his pleasure, and I'le take mine; let him look to his Comodities himself, I have other Comodities in Town to look after beside his, and as I take it a great deal better: if he calls for me when he comes in, tell him I'm gone to see my sister Touchstone. Smoak. I shall forsooth. Mrs. Fraile. And I pray keep you the house, though your shoos be made of running Leather. Smoak. Yes, yes. Exit.
Enter Mrs. Olive. Fraile. Sister Olive, how dost thou do? Olive. I came purposely to see you. Fraile. Wilt go along with me to th' Play? Olive. No, no, I dare not. Fraile. How dare not! art thou a fool, I'd fain see whether my Husband could bring me to that pass or not, I believe I should break his heart first. Olive. Oh fie, do not say so. Fraile. I protest I should, why, woman we were not born to be their slaves, 'tis our selves make our selves so. Olive. You talk merrily. Fraile. And so might'st thou, had'st thou not been a fool; thy own good nature first subjected thee; and now thy Husband keepes thee at a Beck; thou wert an humble Worme and he'l tread on thee, spurn thee to nothing, triumph in his Tyrany, and thou remaine a Mome, a suffering Idiot. Olive. You wrong my Husband there, he scornes to beat me. Fraile. But he does worse, he pinches back or belly; or else thy Purss I'm sure'on't; he'l not spare thee a penny to buy Pepins or scarce Pinns. Olive. He's somewhat wary I confess, but not so bad, as you would make him. Fraile. There's our sister Touchstone the Goldsmith's Wife, she leades a life as merry as the day is long. Olive. The happier she; and yet you do not hear me com∣plain, I am contented. Fraile. So are patient fooles; but women that have wit, are not so tame: if thou wilt see a Play it shall cost thee nothing, I'le warrant thee a Ticket, sh'as a friend, a Player, a pretty fellow that at any time will pleasure her, and her friends too. Olive. I do not love to buy my pastime at so dear a rate. Fraile. How like an Asse thou talk'st, 'tis wonderous pritty to have a Player hand us into the House; and when the Play is done out to the Tavern, where we are merry, Laugh untill we tickle. Olive. Without your Husbands! Fraile. Or we were worse then mad; yet now and then Touch∣stone,
himself comes to us, an easie natur'd man, full of beliefe, dare trust the Player and his wife together, even in the Bed he is so fond of both. Olive. Oh fie upon't, there will no good come on't. Fraile. And if her friend take her to Finsbury, (as now and then we must go see our Cosen supposed living somewhere,) she leaves word, and he perhaps soberly followes after, and if she's gone from thence, or never was there, she is prepar'd with an ex∣cuse for either, 'gainst she comes home; your Players are huge witty and fit a Woman for that purpose rarely; which the good man does hugg with eager credit, and gives his friend thanks for the care he had of his dear wife. This is the fruit of Tickets; now if you'l see a Play, be one of us, we'l find you Tickets and your Husband too. Olive. I am not grown so desperate I thank you, nor you I hope, although you talk so wildly. Fraile. Is mirth term'd wildness then? prithee turn Recluse, shut thy self up in shop, and stinck a Moneth, then come abroad to ayre thy self, and see who will indure thy Company; what, deny to see a Play? refuse a noble Ticket? tha'rt Earth already, doubtless. Olive. 'T makes no matter, you'l ticket it so long that at the last I fear you'l come behind hand in your Reckoning; I'le trouble you no more sweet Mistress Fraile. Exit. Fraile. 'Tis not desir'd, good Robin Wisdomes Daughter. The Baggage though has toucht me to the quick; pox take the Recko∣ning, would it might miscarry, but if it be, here's one I'm sure concern'd in't. Enter Hunt-Cliffe. Hunt-Cliffe. What talking to thy self? Fraile. A thing came in my head that did direct my eyes down to my Belly, but let that pass—methinks y'are mighty smug as though you came but lately from your dear beloved Sweet-Lips. Hunt-Cliffe. Now thou vexest me; I must confess she courts me with as eager an appetite as ever, but I slight her, the thought of thee drawes all my faculties unto their proper center thy dear Bosome; but why so trim art thou for walking, love? Fraile. I am invited by a friend of mine, a sprightly jovial Girle, one I call sister, to see a Play.
Hunt-Cliffe. I prithee what's her Name? Fraile. One that is not in your List I promise you; fie Hunt-Cliffe fie, will you ne're leave enquiring after new Faces, where's the love to me you seem so much to glorifie your self in? Hunt-Cliffe. Dost thou distrust my love, dear heart, my soul and all that do belong to't are thy Vassals: the Light's not con∣stanter unto the day, then I to thee, and dost thou doubt me dearest? Fraile. Nay, nay, with her I dare adventure thee, she is my friend, I know she will not wrong me, besides she has a friend some say dare fight, and he a strict eye carries over her. Hunt-Cliffe. So let him; thou art my Hysperides. But hear thee is my Band and half shirts done? Fraile. They'l be brought home within a day or two. Will you go with us to the Play? Hunt-Cliffe. If you command me, but you know my stock is low, my Moneys will not come to Town this moneth yet, and I hate when I'm frolique to be scanted. Fraile. I have a Piece; doubtless she'l bring another to serve her friend; and that will do't I warrant thee. Hunt-Cliffe. Well I'm thy servant still. Exeunt: Enter Smoak and Samphire. Smoak. What wind drove thee this way? Samphire. The breath of my Mistresses commands, I am sent to a Customer with these two Barells of Anchoves. Smoak. When wilt thou remember me: Samphire. Oh—for thy friends Rasey and Froth. Smoak. I you Rogue did you not promise it. Samphire. And will perform't I vow with the first opportunity— where's thy Mistress? I need not ask for thy Master, I know where he is, he and mine are at the old sport, the merry game. Smoak. And my Mistress is at hers by this time or I'm mistaken, she'l not be one of the last couple in Hell I warrant her. Samphire. A shrew'd woman able to break a man's back if he had no other wayes to do't, but I've a Mistress so far from those wayes, she is as modest, as loving, and as carefull a wife as any in the City; when he has been out all night and perhaps lost twenty
or thirty pound at Dice, she takes no notice on't, but bids him wel∣come home i'th morning with all the sweet words she can devise, gives him a Cawdle, has him to bed, and there he sleeps till three or four a Clock i'th afternoon, & then he's ready for the sport agen. Smoak. A brave woman, mirour of Patience. Samphire. Nay, I've o're heard him swear unto himself, he fear'd he should be damn'd for wronging so good a wife, and by this hand the very thought of her sets me into a trembling; when I'm a∣bout to steal Oyle, Oysters, Anchoves, or any other Comodity to pleasure a friend, but when I consider that it cannot last, and he must break if he holds on his course, I then take hardy grace and make me friends of the unrighteous Mammon. Smoak. Let me not live if't ben't the wisest course, I promise you I practice it, I find my Master draw one part of the house his way, and my Mistress drawes another part her way; and if I (lying in the Shop) don't draw another part my way, let the Rafters of the house fall upon my head. Samphire. I like that well, there is but one way to that Wood, a false Key, my friend. Smoak. I hope thou dost not think me unprovided of such an Engine. Samphire. We shall be brothers by and by, how could I else (my Mistress being so over—vigilant,) accomodate my friends and my self too, and send Time merrily about his business. Smoak. Froth has the same trick too, and so has Rasey (but not a word but mum I charge thee Samphire,) we can keep at our Randevouze from one till five i'th morning, and enter the Tene∣ments with such security as though we had been Tenents there all night. Samphire. When shall we meet? Smoak. I'le give thee notice. Samphire. shall we not drink together? Smoak. A Cup or two at the next door, I'le get a friend to take care of my Shop the while, and call me if need be—Remember Rogue your promise to my friends. Samphire. Pugh, we'l talk of that by and by. Exeunt.
Enter Subtler, Complyance delivered (as in the Barr,) and Froth attending. Subtler. I protest I never knew such bad Trading in my life. Froth. Every one complaines sir, except the Coffee-Houses, and they are never empty. Subtler. They are some hinderance indeed, especially in a mor∣ning, but we have Interlopers neerer us, God bless us from a Gun; each paltry Coachman, Butler, or Cast-serving-man now set up the Victualling Trade; the time has been, we have not had a Room empty before this time o'th day, that Company (as one may say) have sat on one anothers Lap. Complyance. And many turn'd away too, sweet heart, which we would willingly now entertain: Subtler. Pox take their Receptacles, how do they fill, below? Froth. ut thinly truly sir, take one time with another I believe our Custome is as great as theirs. Subtler. I think not, Froth; I do not find it so in my Accompts, and yet I understand not any reason why Gentlemen should for∣sake my house, I never was wanting in my due respects and regard towards them, and have endeavoured to please all Companyes, and distast none. Complyance. That has been my care too sweet heart. Froth. Some men think themselves bound to come alwaies to one house, and love to see the fashion of others, you know sir new Brooms sweep clean; and new Comers promise much to Customers. Subtler. And performe as little after a while; but I have been civil to many, not only trusted 'em with my Comodities, but lent 'em money out of my Purss, which is not yet discharg'd; methinks Gentlemen (as they are Gentlemen) (I name no man,) should think of such civilities, I see 'em daily frequent those places, (though they think they dance in Tenibris) and could take a course that would not please 'em, but I had rather (and 'twould be part of satisfaction to me) enjoy 'em at my house as formerly, for I owe much civility to a Gentleman, and 'twould go 'gainst the hair for me to trouble 'em. Complyance. Yet Gentlemen should do like Gentlemen. Subtler. That's true sweet heart, but every like is not the same.
D'ye see how they flock in yonder? I protest if we have no better Trading, I shall never leave thee money enough when I am dead, to be marry'd in thy white Sattin Gown to another, as thy Pre∣decessor was; no, no, Hercules then supported but one victual∣ling house, and now he has three. Watches. More Company—they are past the Gun—and the Crown—they come hither now I warrant ye—welcome Gentlemen. Enter two or three Gentlemen. 1. Gent. Give us that when we are going Complyance.

Enter 2. or 3. more: Subtler. Here are more sweet heart—welcome Gentlemen—why where are you there? shew these Enter Servant. Gentlemen a Room. Complyance. What will you please to have Gentlemen? 1. Gent. How—what say you! a couple of Chickins. 2. Gent. I, I. Complyance. What Bread Gentlemen? 1. Gent. No Brick; Manchet, and fresh Beer. Complyance. You shall Gentlemen, will you please to walk in? Enter two or three Clerks. Exeunt. 1. Clerk. Mr. Subtler how d'ye? Subtler. The better to see you all well Gentlemen—where are you there—does no man hear me? shew these Gentlemen a Room. Enter Froth.

That I'le promise you Gentlemen—will you walk in? Enter two or three more. Exeunt. Subtler. Here are more Compay sweet heart. Complyance. I hope thou hast complain'd without a cause, it may prove a good Morning.
Subtler. Happy be lucky—where are you there? shew these Gentlemen a Room. Enter Servant. Complyance. What will you please to have? First. A Role, and a Cup of your best Ale. Second. Bring me a single pot of Purle. Complyance. You shall, you shall. Exeunt. The Scene is drawn. ACT the Third. Enter Pepper and Pickle. Pepper. HE has pickl'd you. Pickle. And pepper'd you (my friend) or I'm mistaken. Pepper. A pox take all ill luck, who brought him to us? Pickle. The Devil upon Dun's back I think, I'm sure I've lost seven pound. Pepper. And I'm not much behind thee, dost think he did not put the slirr, upon us were his Dice right? Pickle. Right for his purpose doubtless. Pepper. I know not, but as I could guess he play'd the square. Pickle. And we the Coxcombs, now could I hang my self to think upon the Carke and care my Olive takes at home. Pepper. I shall not fret my neck for that matter, for I have one as careless as thine is carefull, and faith we are well met; if I chance to eat a Spider I hope thou'lt visit my Carcase in the Grave, ycliped Ludgate; there are as merry Worms as heart can wish boy. Pickle. Be no Lillyan Rogue, Predict not; I fear my Stars e're long will direct me that way, if I become thy fellow Collegiate once. A short life and a merry life we'l cry; in the mean time let's tope a Pint at the Rose and so march home. Exeunt. Ener two or three Gentlemen. Gent. Tom, wilt drink a Glass of Wine, or Break-fast with us? 2 Gent. Neit her. I am but just come from the Coffee-House, and must not drink, nor eat till Dinner time.
3 Gent. An imposition ridiculous! and he's but shallow brain'd inclines to keep it. 2 Gent. That's your opinion, but I find it otherwise: If I abstain not some few houres, it will not Operate effectually. 3 Gent. Dares the Turks Bill avouch that Language! he has stollen it from Salvator Winter the grand Operator; tell him I'le justify't. 1 Gent. Did'st not mind his words? a said he must abstain, or 'twould not do: his Body's then beholding more to Abstinence then to the Liquor; and I will maintain't a Cup of Ale-berry, or Warme-Broth exhibited to his small Guts, observing lesser time then now he foolishly prescribes himself, shall actuate in all parts of his Body, and do his business better. 3 Gent. Abandon it. A currish cynicall Drink; I am perswaded the first Inventer was Diogenes Canes, an utter Enemy to sweet Society. 1. Gent. It is suppos'd (and credited by most) the Berry grew upon a Bramble, neer the River Stix, and the Devil to congratulate his Coze the Turk, after a mighty slaughter, made on the Christians, sent a graft of it to Turkey, where it since hath spread it self, and like to Locus over-run the Country; That it being grown both troublesome, and loathsome, the Turk (to ridd his Country of't) Transports it, and sends it by the basest of his People, with a large sale of most Non-sensicall virtue, to vend it 'mongst the Christians, and so poyson 'em. 3 Gent. Much probabillity in't, believe me, Tom; for look but on the colour of the Liquor, and if it don't resemble Stix in self, ne're trust Complexions, nor believe old Poets;
and then the Scent on't does conclude it came from old Gehenna, Lucifers deep Furnace, a stench to stifle virtue and good manners. 2. Gent. A learned Lecture! 1 Gent. Nay, 'tis most pernitious unto the brain, it fires the Pericranium, disorders all the faculties, presents Ideas most delusive; Treason, Murder, (the hand helpes to ambition) twins of villany: Brutus ('tis thought) drank heartily of it when he design'd the death of Royal Caesar; and Cataline Caroust it with more greediness, then th' blood of slaves; The Fryar that murder'd Harry the Fourth of France drank of it; Vaux and Noll (the last grand Conspirator) tost it up and made no bones on't: (Treason went down merrily.) It is a drink fit for dark Lanthorn men, but such as love their reason, and the light, will walk our way (boy) drink good Sack, and laugh. 2 Gent. Prithee let me go, do not bayt me thus. 1 Gent. As I'm a friend to goodness, 'tis my fear (if thou continu'st longer in thy error) thou'st be detected in some Pamphlet, for an Idiot, but a man of far design. I would not have Treason lurke under this thin hide of thine, for there the danger lies, or Caesar speaks untruth, (with Reverence.) 2 Gent. All this won't do. 3 Gent. But mark the folly, Tom, of you Coffee-House hunters you pretend it does preserve your health, keepes you alive better then the Juice of Linum vite, or Aqua-Mirabilis; when (for prbatum) thee was hang'd last Sessions a pretious Pick-pocket that drank it frequently, and with the like observance, as thou dst; and yet you see, mortus est, nay, I am confident, that had'st thou brought a Gallon on't to th' Gallowes,
and made him drink it, 'twould not have sav'd his life: where rests the virtue of your Horse-pond-Liquor then? 2 Gent. Well, well, this noice converts me not nor will I drink with ye. 1 Gent. Go hang thy self Iew; better Company will. There will be ten Pound offer'd ere't be long, to bring some Traytor in, and I hope to find thee. 2 Gent. Pugh, if that be all do your worst. 3 Gent. Farwell burnt bread and pudle water. Exeunt severally. The Coffee-House discovered; three or four Tables set forth, on which are placed small Wax-Lights, Pipes, and Diurnalls. Enter Mahoone triming up the Tables, his Man ordering the Fire-pots and China Cups, his Wife in the Barr, his Maid imployed about the Chocolet. Mahoone. Vat be you doing dere, hore, shade? Maid.

What speakes the Diurnal? third. It sayes the Turk will be here within this Moneth. fourth. We were told that a Moneth ago, and he's not come yet: but what other Newes d'ye hear. fifth. The Roguish Boyes at Westminster ('tis said) cry Doxyes twelve a penny. Sixth. They are cheaper then shotten Herrings then. first. Or Rotten Apples. second. Pox on't, few on 'em e're were sound at Core. seventh. What Tom, art thou there? hang me if I saw thee. second. Nor I thee, Harry how dost do? seventh. Much at one, how does Trading walk. second.

Company at second Table. first. Why Gentlemen, look you, the thing is this, if he come on that side, why then you know he comes not on the other side, but put case he should devide his Army and march both wayes, then you know who can keep him back. second. What does the fellow mean? first. I know what I know, and there's an end, if he Land at Dover once he'l be in England presently. Company. Ha, ha, ha. first. Why Gentlemen 'tis no laughing matter, I know what I know, few words are best; for certain the greatest part of his Army was seen on Calice Sands four Nights ago, though the Di∣urnal mention it not, yet it is as prodigious for ought you know as the late great Whale. third. Gentlemen, has any of you seen the Play of Harry the eight? fourth. Many years ago I did. fifth. And so did I. third. 'Tis rarely set forth, they say. first.

Did you not know Benfield, and Swautted? fifth. Did I not know 'em? yes, and hum'd them off a hun∣dred times. fourth. But did you know Mat Smith, Elis Worth, and Fowler at the Fortune? fifth. Yes, and I will tell you by a good token; Fowler you
know was appointed for the Conquering parts, and it being given out he was to play the Part of a great Captain and mighty Warri∣our, drew much Company; the Play began, and ended with his Valour; but at the end of the Fourth Act he laid so heavily a∣bout him, that some Mutes who stood for Souldiers, fell down as they were dead e're he had toucht their trembling Targets; so he brandisht his Sword & made his Exit; ne're minding to bring off his dead men; which they perceiving, crauld into the Tyreing house, at which, Fowler grew angry, and told 'em, Dogs you should have laine there till you had been fetcht off; and so they crauld out a∣gain, which gave the People such an occasion of Laughter, they cry'd that again that again, that again. fourth. I but what d'ye call him was the man; he plaid the devil in Doctor Faustus, and a fellow in the Gallery throwing a Tobacco-Pipe at him; I hope to see thee (quoth He) e're long as bad as I am, what's that quoth the fellow? the Son of a Whore quoth He. Omnes. Ha, ha, ha. first. You talk of your Players, I am for the Fencers, there are none living now like old Bradshaw, old Batty, Chatterton, and Ned Gibs. fifth.

And so did I, then there was Will the Labourer and Will the Pewterer, that were hang'd—O they were nimble men. fourth.

The sport that I have seen in Lincolnes-Inn-fields, and Moore-fields—did you not know little Dick that kept the Ring? first. What the old fellow? he and I has crackt many a Cup to∣gether; I was a Gamster too in those dayes, I lov'd to raise a Cudgell, and try a fall, as I did my Dinner. fourth. And so did I, I did so pay a Butcher at Bradshawes School once,—I came up to him thus—He rises, & extending his Arme hits the Person sets next him in the mouth second. What do you mean by this, sir?
fourth. I was but shewing how I came on. second. I promise you wer't in another place you should not come off so, sir. first. He meant no harme, only to shew his skill. second. Let him do't some where else. first. The place is as free for us, as 'tis for you, sir, for our money. fourth. Nay if the Gentleman be angry, let him turn the Buckles of his Girdle behind him. third. Come, you do not well, first to give an Offence, and then to justifie your self in't! Mahoone. Vat be dat? vat be dere? hoe make a de noyse, make a de devell, no stay in my Owse begar, take you de varning a dat. fourth. Well, well, we have done. Bring us some more Coffee. first. And Chocolet.

I'm glad on't, but alas, sir, 'tis to them. but a meer Flea bite in comparison, to such a loss on our side; they can spare thirty or forty Thousand and ne're shrink for't. third. With favour, I should think it were good Policy, and I presume much Honour to our Nation, if twenty Thousand men well Disciplin'd, were sent to his Dominions and there plagu'd him, 'twould gore him to the Guts, and make him draw his Army homewards with a pouring vengeance. second. O sir, 'twould cost a world of Money, that, and we are poor; I must confess 'twould be a brave exploit, and fill the mouth of Fame. But it cannot be. first. Pray why, sir? second. Why for many Reasons Sir, as the case stands now we have a Gang of Fellowes would change Sides with them, and among friends we should generally make better Turkes then Christians. third. He cannot be a perfect English man, that to promote his Countryes Honour would not sell halfe his Patrimony. first. It were a shame the Frenchmen should take such an Honour from Us. second.

I'faith sir no, what goods I have I'le keep; and they'l keep me, if not something else will. Pepper.

Ha, ha, ha, weep, for what? for seeking to preserve my self against the storm is coming? let Ludgate be thy Grave and pe∣rish there, I'le be Fraile still, and take my pleasure. Pepper.

And now and then when he does get old Gold, he gives it me to hoord; that at this time I praise my Starrs I have I think far more then will discharge your Debt. Hunt-Cliffe. What of all this? Sweet-Lips. And here they are, which I (to save your Credit) have rob'd my Cabinet of; not thinking any thing too dear for thee, with whom I have entrusted my very self. Hunt-Cliffe. Well, what then?

Hunt-Cliffe. Oh my poor Rogue. Sweet-Lips. None will deny thee Silver on 'em, but be sure they be laid safe, or I'm undone for ever. Hunt-Cliffe. Dost thou fear me? have I a Soul? Sweet-L.
