A LETTER FROM A Gentleman in Germany, touching the Discovery OF A Strange Murder, Committed there, by a Person OF QUALITY, UPON A Lustfull FRYER: For endeavouring to Corrupt his LADY. Being A Translation. LONDON, Printed by G. C. for the Author. 1684.
A LETTER FROM A Gentleman in Germany, touching the Discovery OF A Strange Murder. Sir, HAving nothing further of News, more than what I communicat to you in my Last; I thought fit in order to the Maintenance of the Correspond∣ence between us, to give you the following Relation: Which for the Stranegness thereof, I Question not but will meet with a suitable Reception. A Gentleman of Quality In the Neighbourhood of Vienna, having in the late War Signaliz'd himself in the defence of the said Town, during the time of his Ser∣vice, he recieved an accidental Shot from the Enemies Battery, that Disabled him from the further Engageing
himself in that War. Whereupon, this Noble Gentleman retired himself further up in the Country; where he had a Lady of such Beauty as attracted the Eyes of ll Men: Who residing with her Husband, in a seat of  near adjoyning to a Convent, which this Gentleman h formerly Built; and allowing Maintenance to an Abbot and 12 Fryers: It hap'ned that 2 Fryers one called Father Constantine, and the other Father Conrade, who were at continual Variance and Enmity to each other, and could by no Means be Reconciled; inso∣much, that the whole Covent took particular notice thereof: And it being the Daily Custom of this Gentle∣man and his Lady, who intended a Life of Devocion to resort to Prayers every Morning, the Lady being of an Affable and Courteous Disposition: this good Behaviour of hers, bred an uncivil Boldness in Father Constantine, so that she never came near the Cloyster, but he was still attending her with Bows, Cringes and Complements, and she suspecting nothing, returned him Thanks: which so far Encouraged the Fryer, that he resolved at last to Write to her, and therein discover his Passion; which accordingly he did; and with much Difficulty conveyed the same to the Ladys Hand: Who being much Surprised that such Lacivi∣ousness should proceed from one that Vowed and pro∣fess'd Chastity, was resolved to Discover the same to her Lord, which she had no sooner done, but he began to Repent him of his former Charity, in regard of this so great Ingratitude: yet meditateing Revenge, he ordered his Lady to Write in Answer to this Letter, that she was very Compassionate of his Love; and that such a Night her Husband being to go to Court, he should be admitted, and Lodge according to his desire.
The Fryer received the Letter with extreame Joy, and accordingly observing the Hour, he was admitted by the Lady her self,) and Conveyed into a private Cham∣ber: Where he was no sooner entred, but in came the Gentleman with a Servant or two in great Fury, with∣out giving him the least time to call to the House or Hea∣ven, they Strangled the Lustfull Fryer, and left him Dead upon the Place: Which was no sooner done, but the Gentleman began to consider the Horror and Danger of the Fact, both as to his Life and Estate; and after several Projects, he at last concluded with his Servants to have the Body Conveyed back into the Monastry, being divided from his own House only by a Stone-Wall; and finding a Ladder hard by, one of the Servants mounts it with the Fryer upon his Back, and sits with him awhile on the Wall, then drawing up the Ladder, and letting it down on the other side, he descends into the Convent, where spying the House of Office, he sets the Body thereon, as upright as possible, and so leaves it, and Conveys himself over the Wall again, but for hast forgot the Ladder, and tells his Master how he had disposed the Fryer; at which being better Satisfied, they retired to Bed, the matter being concealed from the rest of the Family, being fast a Sleep: But so it hapned, that as soon as the Servant got over the Wall, Father Conrade being troubled with a Loos∣ness, hasts down to the House of Office, where by the Light of the Moon, he percieved Fryer Constantine, his old Adversary, got upon the Seat before him, who the louder he call'd, seemed the less to Hear; whereat thinking this pretended Deafness was out of Spite to Vex him, he snatches up a Brick-bat, and striking him on the Breast, down tumbles Fryer Constantine, without
Life or Motion; which Conrade seeing, thought at first to raise him up, but after many Trials finding him to be stone Dead, he believed he had Kill'd him; and be∣gan to Consult with himself what he should do in this case, the Gates were fast Locked, and flie for his Life he could not: But as sudden Extremity sometimes meet sudden Shifts, he spying the Ladder against the Wall, presently apprehends what had been Whispered of Fryer Constantines Love to the Lady, and lifting him upon his Shoulder, by the help of the Ladder conveyed him into the Gentlemans Porch, and there left him; Conveying himself into the Monastry the same way he came, being not in the least Suspected. In the mean while the Gentleman being troubled in his Conscience, could not Sleep, but calling up one of Servants bids him listen to the Walls of the Monastry, which as he was about to do, passing the Porch, he spies Father Constantine siting upright upon the Bench; at which being greatly amazed, he run back and acquain∣ted his Master therewith; who no less Surprized, could not believe the same, till he went down and became Eye Witness thereof; and being extreamly concerned, reflected on himself that Murder was a Crying Sin, and was seldom or never Concealed; yet recolecting his Memory, he resolved to try a Desperate Adventure, and put the Discovery upon Chance: And remembring he had an old Stallion in the Stable that had served him in the War, and likewise a Rusty Suit of Armor in his Armory; this he commands instantly to be brought with a Case of Rusty Pistols and a Launce; the Horse was Imediately made Ready, and the Dead Fryer mounted and bound fast to the Saddle; thus like a compleat Knight they turn'd him out of the Gate to
try his Adventures. Whilst these things were thus fit∣ting, Fryer Conrade in the Monastry was no less perplex∣ed in his Mind than the Gentleman about the Murder; and much Dreading the strictness of the Law, sum∣mond his Wits about him how to escape with his Life, which he thus Concluded: remembring there was in the Convent a Mare that was employed to carry Corn to and from a Mill about half a Mile from the Monastry, and being somewhat Fat, and doubting his Foot-man∣ship, he thought it was better to trust to 4 Legs than 2; whereupon he calls up the Baker that had charge of the Beast, and tells him he understood there was some Meal to be fetched that Morning from the Mill, which was Grinded by that time; and therefore if he would let him have the Mare, he would fetch it home for him, and save him the Trouble: The Fellow being glad of the Offer, caused the Back-Gate to be Opened, out of which the Fryer Rid, just at the same time when the Gentleman and his Servant had turn'd out Fryer Constantine, to seek his Fortune as aforesaid. Where∣upon the Horse presently scents the Mare, and Gallops after her, but Fryer Conrade looking back, was amazed to see an Armed Knight follow him; but much more when by the Light of the Moon and the Beaver flying up, he percieved it was Fryer Constantine that was thus Armed; and thereupon flies as fast as he could: but after him, or rather after the Mare Speeds the Horse: A great Noise there was, and Fryer Conrades ill Fate led him into a certain Turn-again-Lane, where he was overtaken by the Stone-Horse, who covered the Mare; which caused a great Noise, and Fryer Conrades Con∣science thereupon Accusing him, he cries out Guilty of Murder; at the Noise whereof the People gat out of
their Beds and run into the Street; where Fryer Con∣rade Confess'd the Horrid and Unhumane Act he had done, in Murdering one of his Convent; which was look'd upon as a Judgment from Heaven, and believed from the former Grudge between them. Whereupon Fryer Constantine was Dismounted and carried to his Grave, and Fryer Conrade was committed to Prison, Arraigned and Condemned; but before Execution, the Gentleman posts to the Emperour, and made his Con∣fession of the whole Fact: Whereupon in respect of his former Service he was Pardoned by the Emperour; and Fryer Conrade Acquitted. Thus Sir, you have the particulars of this Comical Tragedy; if I may so term it: Which I hope may Divert you, as it has done us in this Neighbour-hood. And in my next, I hope to give you an account of the Surrender of Buda: The Duke of Lorrain being great∣ly Enforced by the accession of the Bavarian Troops, which hath Encouraged his Army to a Wonder. This is all at present, with my Service to your Self and Lady, I remain Your humble Servant Abraham Vandenberg. September the 11th. 1684. FINIS.
