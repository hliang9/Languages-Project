KENTISH Long-tayles AND Essex Calves: Or, the Copie of a LETTER Sent from a Gentleman of the Army to a friend in the West, containing a com∣pendious Relation of the late Tray∣terous insurrections in the said COUNTIES. Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum. Printed at London for R. M. 1648.
SIR, IF I mistake not, the Kentish-men were up in Rebellion before you went last from hence, and therefore you may expect to be advertised of the issue and event of that businesse, six or eight thousand of those Rebels were imbodied upon Black-Hearth, which is within two or three miles of Christen∣dome, (for Kent is commonly said to be out of Christendome,) and certainly if they had been good Christians, they would never have had thoughts of such a Diabolicall attempt; many of them were well armed, and good Horse as well as Foote among them, and two small Field-Pee∣ces, which were mounted in Debtford, where their Head-Quarters were for one or two nights, the Generall sent a Party of Horse under com∣mand of Colonel Whaley, upon whose Alarm and approach the enemy removed from Debtford, Black-Hearth and Greenwich, (leaving there two Field-Peeces behind them,) unto Dartford, and from thence were chased to Rochester, many of them being taken prisoners and slaine in the flight, and the Major of that place in safe Custo∣dy,
that City being also ingaged, and now redu∣ced. Our Forces compassed the Countrey, where the Rivers were most fordable, and other passes most accessable, (for the enemy had used much skil in obstructing many of the nearest passages) at last our Forces encountred them again at Maidston, a chiefe Towne in that County, where they dis∣puted their entrance with the enemy, in a very fierce and hot manner, for the greatest part of one very wet night, killing many, and taking many prisoners; at last they all dispersed and fled away, leaving their Armes and Horses, and our Forces to be Masters of the Town. Quis clades illius noctis quis funera fando Explicit, aut potuit lachrymis equare labores? This place and that part of the County so set∣led, the Generall marched to Canterbury, where two or three thousand more of the Kentishmen and Inhabitants, had put themselves in a warlike posture against the Parliaments Forces. Within some few dayes by the wisedome and valour of the Generall and his Army, Canterbury was taken in upon mercifull Articles assented to and sub∣scribed by his Excellency: whilst these things were acting, the enemy had besieged Dover-Castle, and possessed themselves of two or three other little
Castles, not far from that, the General sent a party to relieve the same, and it is effectually performed, so that this County is in a manner totally reduced, only the small Castles before mentioned, stand out, and are beleagured by so considerable a party, as (by Gods blessing) there will be a good and speedy ac∣count thereof: In this action, most of the chiefest of the Gentlemen of the County were ingaged, many of them with 13. or 1400. more were taken Prisoners, and 200. at the least slaine, and great store of Horses Armes and Ammunition taken. At the first appearance of this Action, there were some contest amongst the Gentlemen, who should be their Generall or Commander in chiefe of their Forces, at last they pitcht upon one Esquire Hales, (a bird that hath good feathers to pluck) and o∣ther Gentlemen of the County had their parts in this insurrection, as Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels, Majors, Captains, &c. but their splendor continu∣ed but a short time, for the sudden appearance of the super-annuated Lord Goring eclipsed their lustre, the supream Command being devolved on him, which he manfully maintained till he was well beaten out of the County, and forced to take soyle like a hurt Deer; At the Isle of Dogges, he lan∣ded with as many as he could get to runne away with him, but some was so hasty to follow their
Leader, that Charon mistaking the landing place, (being a dark night) wafted them over into the land of darknesse, saw them rebaptized in Thamisis, and there left them to feast the Inhabitants of that Elementary Region, and there I also leave them till the Resurrection, and by that time they may be changed into Sharks, or Cod-fishes, to be served up at Pluto's Table, when he invites their Generalissimo to dinner. This Lord is called the Earle of Nor∣wich, and from hence some conceit that his un∣quiet spirit had a Transmigration into the Butchers of Norwich, which occasioned the late Tumult there; It had been well for these Counties of Kent and Essex if this their Earle had been then amongst some of those brutish Cut-throats, though I think he had no hand in the Papists Powder-Plot: This great Generall with his flying Army hath now put himselfe amongst a herd of Essex Claves, and hath been so closely hunted by the Generals Buck∣hounds, (who had the scent of them at least a mile off,) that at the first onset, he and his Beasts of prey quitted Bow-Bridg with the losse of some men, the taking of some Prisoners, and relmquishing two great Peeces planted upon the said Bridg; With∣out further dispute (not daring to make a Halt at Burnt-wood as being too hot for them,) they made a running retreat to Chelmesford, hoping to do
wonders by the helpe of the Earle of Warwick his plundered Armory.) The fortunate and valiant Ge∣nerall with a considerable number of his Forces are in hot pursuit of them, not doubting but by Gods assistance his Excellencies Sword will overtake those unnaturall blood-suckers, whose grand designe hath been to imbark this kingdom in a second bloody War from which the Lord deliver us. Some of the Mem∣bers of the House of Commons, and others of the Committee of that County, these besotted Essexi∣ans have taken prisoners, set a guard upon them, and use them very harshly, as is said; but the House of Commons have given directions to their noble Gi∣deon, that if any force shall be offered to the said Gen∣tlemen by the enemy, that then he shall give no quarter to any of them. Our best intelligence assures us, that Goring and his dampned crew for their plundring and outragious deportments, are deserted by multitudes of the Essex men, and thousands risen up against them, crying unanimously, We are deceived, we are deceived; and so indeed they are, rendring themselves by their in∣considerate ingaging with them (and that upon seve∣rall and distinct interests, as witlesse as their Country man Walthams-Calfe, that went 9 miles to suck a Bull. How unhappy are these men that have not grace to acquiesse in the mercy of God who preserved them
all this while from plunderings and many other mise∣ries which other Counties have groaned under, and now at the last they have called in the roaring Gorin∣gy to dispoyle them of all their wealth and riches that the sufferings of many wasted Counties did transferre to them; Oh ye brainsick Bleaters, Who hath bewitched you? The rest of the infatuated White Faces of that County (who yet stand to it as if they resolved to inforce their own destruction) have now chosen one Sir Charles Lucas (a younger Brother of Lucus. England) to be their Generall, and its very probable that in a very short time he will lose himselfe and all his Desperadoes in a wood, and the Generals Mirmi∣dons will hew them down Pell-mell with their Bil∣boe's, whoe's the Asse then Sir, who? This day about noone one Colonel Humphreyes brought intelligence to the House of Commons, that his Excellency and the Enemy were engaged yester∣day about three or foure a clock in the afternoone, that Goring and his Hell-hounds, were then impoun∣ded in Colchester, the Generall then preparing to storme that Towne; No Replevin will lye in this case, and therefore those Rebels must now stand to the judgement of the Sword, the justice whereof, I hope we shall heare of before to morrow night. By my next I hope to acquaint you that the di∣stempers
of this county are well allayed and setled, as those of Kent, In the interim, let this Narrative suffice to raise up your Spirits, and confirm you in aconstant dependancy upon the Lord of Hosts, who fights the battailes of his servants, but beware of relying too much upon an Arme of flesh, give all the glory to God, and on him cast all your confidence; I shall insist no further but subscribe, Your, London 14 June 1648. FINIS.
