THE CASE OF John Degrave, Francis Minshall and others, Owners of the Seven Sail of Ships taken up in July, 1697. by the Commissioners of the Transport. Humbly presented to the Honourable House of Commons, That the Transport did endeavour to hire Ships to carry Provisions to Newfoundland, but it being so late in the Year were generally refused because it was so extreamly dangerous to undertake; They would not run the hazard of their Shipping and Men in so difficult an Undertaking. THAT the said Degrave and Minshall with others, who understood the Country and Dangers thereof, being informed that the said Country must needs perish except they were supplied, did conclude amongst themselves to run all Dangers whatever to perform so great a Service as they found that would be to His MAJESTY and GOVERNMENT; and so forthwith did Contract with the Transport to perform the same, and did agree to be paid out of that Years Funds; so that then their Ships did proceed accordingly, tho' when they came on the Coast, it being so late in the Year, they underwent great hardships and losses both in the Rigging and Sails, and other Inconveniencies both to Men and Ships; so that in Seven Sail but Four could attain to the Relief thereof; and yet notwithstanding this Service was faithâˆ£fully performed with so great a difficulty and loss, and to be paid out of the Funds as aforesaid, there is no satisfaction as yet received by the Performers thereof, altho' the Accompts are settled, made up and allowed by the Transport. All which is Humbly submitted to the Consideration of this Honourable House.
