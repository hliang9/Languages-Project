THE PETITION AND REMONSTRANCE OF THE GOVERNOƲR And Company of Merchants of London trading to the East Indies, exhibited to the Right Honourable the Lords and Com∣mons, in the High Court of Par∣liament assembled. DEƲS INDICA East India Company coat of arms London Printed for Nicholas Bourne. 1641.
THE HUMBLE REMONSTRANCE OF Those Reasons which the Gover∣nour and Company of Merchants of London trading to the East-India, doe make upon the Quaeres that are annexed unto their Petiti∣on, exhibited in the Honourable House of COMMONS, assembled in PARLIAMENT. And First, Whether it doth not much increase the strength of the Kingdom with ma∣riners, Warlike Shipping, Ammuniti∣on, and all necessary Arts-men there∣unto belonging.
Whether it doth not greatly increase the generall Traffique of the King∣dome, not onely as it is a very ample Trade of it selfe betweene England and the Indies; but also as it is an ample Staple or Magazine of ma∣ny rich Indian wares to send from hence into other forraigne Coun∣tries. THE Trade to the East Indies some few yeares past, when we had warre with the Portugals, did imploy fifteene thousand tunnes of Shipping all at once, either going or comming, or Trading there from Port to Port; but since (upon good experience) we find that so great a charge is neither necessarie for our defence; nor comportable by the benefit of the Traffique, un∣till some further Discoveries may be made in China, or else-where, as is hoped: Neverthelesse (according to the present times) there may be imployed and maintained eight thousand tunnes of great and warlike Shipping, besides two thou∣sands tunnes more here in the Kingdome continu∣ally repayring for the next supply of those Voya∣ges.
THis Trade as it is thus great in it selfe; so doth it yet further enlarge our Traffique and strength, by furnishing this Kingdome with all sorts of Indian wares, not onely for our owne use, but more especially for the necessary wants of forraigne Nations, which hath greatly encreased the number of our Warlike Ships, to export them from hence into Turkie, Italy, the East Countries, and other places: For proofe whereof we instance some former-times, when wee have brought into England above eight thousand bagges of Pepper from the In∣dies in one year (and may do so againe if the Trade subsist) Where this Kingdome doth not consume above one thousand and three hundred bagges per annum at the most; So the rest are transported into forraigne Countries; and the like may be said for Callicoes, Indigo, and some other Indian Wares. ALl which additions of shipping unto our for∣mer strength by Sea before this Trade began, doe imploy many of his Majesties subjects in sun∣dry Arts to build and repaire the said ships, toge∣ther with the making of Ordnance, Muskets, Pow∣der, Shot, Swords, Pikes, Cordage, Canvas, and o∣ther necessary Amunitions and provisions thereun∣to belonging; besides a multitude of Mariners, whereof many of them are shipped from hence. Land-men or such as were not formerly used to the Seas, but are bred and made good Mariners by these Voyages, which otherwise at home (being with∣out Arts or maintainance) are a heavy burthen to their friends and Country.
ANd if it be objected, that this great encrease of shipping which is here declared, is not alwayes in the Kingdome upon occasion of service, the an∣swer is. That neither are the shippes of any other Merchants heere at home, but some are going, some are comming, and ever the least part are in the King∣dome; yet still wheresoever they are, his Majesties subjects have by them their imployment and main∣tenance, and the Kingdome aswell as the East-India Company have had their service: For how famous are their exploits to all Nations? How many rich Carracks have they suncke and spoyled? How ma∣ny assaults of Spanish Gallions have they withstood and foyled? What slaughter of their souldiers, sacke of their Townes, subversion of their trades, and such like honourable actions have they perfor∣med? and all with little losse of ships or men? It would require a large discourse, to declare the par∣ticulars: Neither doth the East-India Company commonly want two thousand Tuns of shipping or more heere in the Kingdome, which are either in building or repayring, together with all their Ord∣nance and other Warlike furniture, besides their store-houses and Dock-yards, plentifully provided with Timber, Plancke, Cordage, Powder, shot, and many other necessary Ammunitions both for them∣selves, and oftentimes to help others with such pro∣visions as cannot elsewhere be found for money in this Kingdome.
THere is yet one common Objection, but it is so weake that it scarse deserves an answer, which is, that this East-India Trade destroyes our ship∣ping and Marriners, when cleane contrary to this we have already shewed the great encrease of both, and if men dye in these long voyages, and ships by length of time be layd up, either here or in the In∣dies, yet what's all this but natures course? and that which happens here at home in our neerest Trades, although with farre lesse noyse and notice; How many brave Commanders have we bred from meane degree? (whereof divers are still in our service) some at this present are found worthy good places in his Majesties Navie, others (being growne rich) doe either keepe at home, or follow shorter voya∣ges; but leaving these advantages wee doe answer all with this, that whatsoever is pretended in the decay of shipping or death of men, yet notwithstanding the Kingdome, by this trade hath obtained no lesse in∣crease or cleare addition both of the one and the other, which continually subsist and are in action, then is before declared. Whether it doth not increase the generall stocke and wealth of the Kingdome. Whether it be not a meanes to save the particular Sub∣jects much money yearly in their ordinary expences upon all sorts of Indian wares. Whether it doth not much increase his Majesties Customes and Imposts in the yearely revenue. VVhether it is not a good meanes to improve the price
of Lands, Woolls, Tynne, Iron, Lead, and other the Wealth. native commodities of this Kingdome. VVhether the King and the Kingdome (also) have not gotten much by this Trade, even in these late disastrous times, when the Adventurers have lost great mat∣ters. HEre wee have five Quaeres which must be all proved severally, the first is generall, where∣in wee must consider how the whole King∣dome may be inriched by our Commerce with strangers, the which to performe, although it hath one & the same rule in all the particular places of the Trade, yet is not every Country alike profitable to this Common-wealth, for the remotest Traffique is alwayes most beneficiall to the publique Stocke, The places of our remotest Traffique are most profita∣ble to the Common-wealth. the example may be framed thus. Suppose we there∣fore, that Pepper were constantly worth 2. shillings the pound here in England, if wee should then fetch the same from Holland the Merchant may pay there to the stranger twenty pence the pound out of this Kingdomes stocke, and gaine well by the bargaine, but if he fetch this Pepper from the East-Indies, hee cannot give there above five pence the pound at the most to obtaine the like gaine, when all charges are considered; which doth sufficiently shew the great advantage we have to buy our wares in those remote Countries, not onely for that part alone which wee spend and consume, but especially for that great quantity which from hence wee transport yearely into other Countries to be sold at higher price then
it is worth here in England; Whereby it is plaine, We may grow rich in Trade by the Stocke of other Na∣tions. that we make a farre greater Stocke by gaine upon these Indian Commodities, then those Nations doe where they grow; and to whom they properly ap∣pertaine, as being the naturall wealth of their Coun∣tries: neither is there lesse honour and judgement by getting riches in this manner, upon the Stocke of other Nations, then by an industrious encrease of our owne meanes, especially whe this latter is ad∣vanced by the benefit of the former, as we have found in the East-Indies by sale of much of our Cloth, Cloth and Lead vented in the East-Indies. Lead; and other native Commodities, the vent whereof doth daily encrease in those Countries, which formerly had no use of our Wares, but for the better understanding of that which hath beene said, we must not forget to distinguish betweene the gaine of the Kingdome, and the profit of the Mer∣chant. A distinction betweene the gaine of the Kingdome, and the profit of the Mer∣chant. For although the Kingdome pay no more for this Pepper then is before supposed, nor for any o∣ther Commodity bought in forraigne parts, more then the stranger receiveth from us for the same; yet the Merchant payeth not onely that price, but also the fraight, ensurance, interest, custome, impost, and many other charges which are exceeding great in these long Voyages; but yet all these in the King∣domes account are but commutations among our selves, and no privation of the publique stocke, they remaine still in the Kingdome.
NOw concerning that which every particular subject of the Realme saveth in his ordinary expence of Indian Wares, it is manifest that heretofore when we brought Indico from Turky, that sort was ordinarily sold here for seven shillings the pound or more, which now we sell for five shillings the pound and under, Pepper then ordinarily at three shillings and three shillings foure pence the pound, which now is sold by the East-India Compa∣ny The Hollan∣ders in grossing of Cloves, Ma¦ces, and Nut∣megs, have made them exceeding deare. for 18. pence the pound, with long time also gi∣ven therewith for payment, and so likewise of divers other wares: but for Cloves, Maces, & Nutmegs, they are at very dear prices, because the Hollanders having expelled our people from the Ilands of the Moluccoes, Banda, & Amboina, do still keep us by force from the trade of those Spices: In which wares when we enjoy∣ed the freedome in the Indies that unto us belongeth, we sold those Spices at two rates: But as the Dutch have raised the price of these Commodities, so would they much more inhaunce them and all other the rich Wares of those Countries, if wee should abandon or be basely driven from the Trade. THe next Quaere needes but little proofe, for who can truely say that his Majesties Cu∣stomes and Impost are not multiplyed, when the Traffique of this Kingdome is so much encrea∣sed: onely this we will affirme, that if the Trade to the East-Indies were so well encouraged that it might be effectually followed, it would yearly bring to his Majesties Coffers much more then now it doth.
THe next Quaere Concernes the Kingdome neerely, for it is no small worth to improve the price of Lands, which never hath not can be done, (to the common benefit) but by the pros∣perous successe of our forraigne trade, the Ballance whereof is the onely meanes and rule of our trea∣sure: The ballance of our for∣raigne trade is the true rule of our treasure. that is to say, when either by issuing out of the Realme yearely a greater value in Wares then wee consume of forraigne Commodities we grow rich, or by spending more of Strangers goods then we sell them of our owne, wee are impoverished; For the first of these courses doth bring in the mony which we have, the last will carry it away againe when wee have got it. It is a true saying, that plenty or scar∣sity of money makes all things deare or cheape in a Common-wealth, but it is necessary to distinguish the seeming plenties of money from that which onely is substantiall and able to performe the work; For there are divers wayes and meanes to procure plenty of money into a Kingdome, (for a short time) which doe not therefore inrich, but rather impoverish the same, by the severall inconveniencies which ever accompany such alterations. FOr first, if we should melt downe our Plate in∣to Coyne, which suits not with the Majesty of so great a Kingdome, except in cases of great extre∣mity, it would cause plenty of money for a time, yet should we be nothing the richer, but rather this Treasure being thus altered, is made the more apter
to be carried out of the Kingdome, if we exceed our meanes by excesse in forraigne wares, or maintaine a War by Sea or Land, where we doe not feed and cloath the Souldier, and supply the armies with our owne native provisions; by which disorders our Treasure will soone be exhausted, for it is not the Merchants exchange by bills that can prevent the last of these evills, as some have supposed. A∣gaine if we thinke to bring in store of money by suffering forraigne Coynes to passe currant heere at higher rates then their intrinsicke value, compa∣red with our standard; or by debasing, or by in∣haunsing our owne monies (as some men have pro∣jected) all these actions bring their severall inconve∣niences, and notable ruines, as well to the King, as to his Subjects, of which we omit to enlarge, (be∣cause it is not much pertinent to our cause in hand) but rather admitting that by these courses, plentie of money might be brought into the Realme, yet should we be nothing the richer, neither can such treasure (so gotten) long remaine with us, for, whe∣ther Treasure which cannot long remaine with us. it be the stranger or the English Merchant that brings in this money, it must ever be done up∣on a valuable consideration, either for wares carried out already, or after to be exported, which helpes us nothing except the evill occasions of excesse or War aforenamed be removed, which will exhaust our treasure; for otherwise, the money that one man bringeth in for gaine, an other shall be forced to carry out for necessity, because there shall ever be a necessity to ballance our account with Strangers,
although it should be done with great losse upon the rate of the money which is exported, and perill or consiscations also, if it be intercepted by the Law, for necessity orgaine will ever find some means to violate such Lawes. BUt if it should be objected that the price of our Lands are not improved onely by Treasure gai∣ned in our forraigne Trade, but also by a great in∣crease of people, whether they be natives or stran∣gers, The great in∣crease of stran∣gers inhabi∣ting here, doth impoverish this Kingdome, and begger our poore by de∣priving them of their Arts and manufa∣ctures, raysing the price of corne, victuals Rents, and the like. or both: The answer is, that the first of these wayes doth performe it to the (common benefit) and the latter to the inriching of the Landlords onely by a manifest impoverishing of the King∣dome: For our experience in one particular doth teach us, that of late yeares we are growne so popu∣lous, that we can spare no corne to transport into forraigne Countries, but sell it all here to serve our owne wants at deare rates, which formerly when it was much cheaper imployed many ships and mar∣riners to export it unto strangers, and thereby re∣turned us store of Treasure, which great benefit to the Kingdome is now lost. And as hereby the ex∣portation of our native Commodities is much di∣minished, so our consumption of forraigne Wares is asmuch increased, which is a double meanes to impoverish this Kingdome.
THe businesse then is briefly thus, that as the treasure which is brought into the Realme by the ballance of our forraigne trade, is that money which onely doth abide with us, and by which we Treasure that doth remaine with us inrich us, and doth improve our Lands. are inriched, so by this plenty of money thus got∣ten (and no otherwise) doe our lands improve, for when the Merchant hath a good dispatch beyond the Seas, for his Cloath, and other our native wares, he doth presently returne to buy up the greater quanti∣ty which raiseth the price of Woolls, and other commodities, which doth improve the Land-lords rents, as the Leases expire dayly; and also by this meanes money being gained and brought more a∣boundantly into this Kingdome, it doth inable ma∣ny men to buy Lands which must make them the dearer: but if our forraigne Trade come to a stop or declination by neglect at home, or injuries abroad, whereby the Merchants are impoverished, and so the Wares of the Realme lesse issued, then do all the said benefits cease, and our Lands fall of price dayly: whereupon we conclude, that as the flourishing e∣state of our generall Trade is the onely meanes to make our Lands improve, so the particular Trade to the East-Indies, is a principall instrument therein, because (as we have already proved) it hath so much increased the Traffique of this Kingdome.
THe next Quaere seemes to be a mystery which many of our Adventures doe not well un∣derstand, for (say they) how can the King∣dome gaine by this Trade, when wee who are the members thereof, have lost so grievously? they doe not well discerne that their private losse may be far lesse in proportion, then the publique benefit, as we shall instance some examples to make the businesse plaine. IN the course of forraigne Trade, there be three Three degrees of gaine in for∣raigne Trade. sorts or degrees of gain, the first, that of the Com∣mon-wealth, which may be done when the Merchant (who is principall agent therein) shall loose. The se∣cond is the gaine of the Merchant, which he doth sometimes justly and worthily effect, although the Common-wealth be a looser. The third is the gaine of the King, whereof he is ever certaine even when the Common-wealth and the Merchant shall be both loosers. COncerning the first of these, we have alreadie sufficiently shewed the waies and meanes where∣by the Common-wealth may be inriched in the course of Trade, by the ballance of the same, when excesses are avoyded: therefore it is needlesse here to make any further repetition: onely wee doe in this place affirme that such happinesse may be in the Common-wealth, when the Merchant for his
particular shall have no occasion to rejoyce. As for example, suppose the East-India Company should send out one hundred thousand pounds in Wares or money into the East-Indies, and receive home for the same, the full value of three hundred thou∣sand pounds, hereby it is evident that this part of the publique stocke is trebled, and yet we may bold∣ly say, that which we can well prove, that our said Company of Merchants shall be loosers by such an adventure, if the returnes be made in Spice, Indico, Callicoes, Benjamin, refined Salt-Peter, Cotton-yarne, and such other bulkey wares in their severall proportions, according to their vent & use in these parts of Europe: for the freight of shipping, the in∣surance of the Adventnre, the charges of Factors abroad, and Officers at home, the forbearance of the Stocke, his Majesties custome and imposts, with other petty charges incident, will bee above two hundred thousand pounds, which being added to the principall produceth losse, and thus we see that not onely the Kingdome, but also the KING The King and Kingdome may get by Trade; even when the Merchant loseth. may get very much, even when the Merchant not∣withstanding shall loose in his proportion, which giveth good occasion here to consider how much more the Realme is inriched by this Trade, when all things psse so happily that the Merchant is a gayner also together with the KING and King∣dome.
BUt for the better explaning of that which hath beene already alledged, wee must understand that if the said hundred thousand pounds should be trebled by the returne of so much Silkes and o∣ther fine Wares out of the Indies, then the Mer∣chant likewise should receive good gaine by such an adventure; and the reason is, because this great wealth would require but five hundred tunne of shipping to lade and bring home the same, which is but a very small charge in respect of foure thousand tunnes of shipping, which would be re∣quired to lade home the like value in the bulkie Commodities of Spice and the like, which are afore-written. THe second sort of gaine in the course of trade is, when the Merchant by his laudable endea∣vours may both bring in and carry out Wares to his advantage, by buying them and selling them to good profit, which is the end of his labours: Yet neverthelesse, the Common-wealth shall de∣cline and grow poore by a disorder in the people, when through pride and other excesses they doe consume more forraigne Ware in value, then the wealth of the Kingdome can satisfie and pay by the exportation of our owne Commodities, which is the very quality of an unthrift, who spends beyond his meanes.
THe third sort of gaine is the Kings, who is ever sure to get by Trade, when both the Common-wealth and the Merchant shall loose severally, as a∣fore-written; or joyntly, as it may and doth some∣times happen when the Merchants successe is bad, and when our Commodities are over ballanced by forraigne Wares consumed: but if such disorders be not prevented, his Majesty in the end shall be the greatest looser, when his Subjects be impove∣rished. Whether it be not a meanes greatly to weaken the King of Spaine and his Subjects, and to exhaust their Trea∣sure. Whether it be not a meanes to Counterpoize the Hollanders swelling-greatnesse by Trade, and to keepe them from being absolute Lords of the Seas, if they may drive us out of this rich Traffique, as they have long endea∣voured to performe.
THe safetie of the Kingdome consists not onely in i'ts owne strength and wealth, but also in the laudable and lawfull per∣formance of those things which will wea∣ken and impoverish such powerfull Princes, as either are, or may become our Enemies; A∣mongst which we will now ranke the Spaniard in the first place, who being euabled by the pow∣er of his Indian Treasure, not onely to keepe in subjection many goodly States and Provin∣ces in Italy, the Low-Countries, and elsewhere, (which otherwise would soone fall from his o∣beyfance) but also by a continuall Warre ta∣king his advantages, doth still enlarge his Do∣minions, ayming at nothing more then Mon∣archy by this plenty of his money, which are the very synewes of his strength, that lye so far dispersed into so many Countries, yet hereby united, and his wants supplyed both for Warre and peace in a plentifull manner from all the part of Christendome, which are therefore pertakers of his Treasure by a necessitie of com∣merce, Spanish Trea∣sure is exhau∣sted by ane∣cessity of com∣merce. Wherein the Spanish policie hath ever indeavoured to prevent all other Nations the most it could; For, finding Spaine to bee too poore and barren to supply it selfe and the WEST-INDIES, with those varieties of forraigne Wares, whereof they stand in need, they knew well that when their native Commodities
come short to this purpose, then their monies must serve to make up the reckoning whereupon they found incredible advantage by adding the Traffique of the East-Indies Spanish poli∣cie and pro∣fit in the East India Trade. to the Treasure of the West: For the last of these being imployed in the first they stored themselves infinitely with rich Wares, to barter with all the parts of Christendome for their Commodities, and so furnishing their owne necessities, prevented others for carrying away their monies, which in poynt of State they hold lesse dangerous to impart to the re∣mote Indians then to their neighbour Princes, least it should too much inable them to resist (if not offend) their Enemies: And this Spanish policie against others is the more re∣markeable being done likewise so much to their owne advantage; For, every Ryall of Eight which they sent to the East-Indies; brought home so much Wares, as saved them the disbursing of six Royalls of Eight here in EUROPE (at the least) to their neighbours; especially in those times when that Trade was onely in their hands: But now this great pro∣fit is fayled, and the mischiefe removed by the English and Dutch, who partake in those East-India Trades as amply as the Spanish Subjects. IT is further to be considered that besides the disability of the Spanyard, by their na∣tive
Commodities to provie forraigne wares for their necessities (whereby they are forced to supply their wants with money) they have likewise that Canker of warre which doth in∣finitly exhaust their Treasure and disperse it Spanish Trea∣sure is exhau∣sted by Warre. into Christendome even to their Enemies, part by reprisall, but especially thorough a ne∣cessary maintenance of those Armies which are composed of many strangers, and lye so farre remote that they cannot feed, Cloath, or otherwise provide them out of their owne native meanes and provisions, but must re∣ceive this reliefe from other Nations: which The effects of different wars concerning Treasure. kind of warre is farre different to that which a Prince maketh upon his owne confines, or in his Navies by sea, where the souldier receiving monies for his wages must everie day deliver it out againe for his necessities, whereby the Treasure remaines still in the King∣dome, although it be exhausted from the King, but we see that the Spanyard (trusting in the power of his Treasure) undertakes Warres in Germanie and other remote places which would soone begger the richest Kingdome in Christendome of all their money, the want whereof would presently disorder and bring the Armies to confusion, as it falleth out some∣times with Spaine it selfe (who hath the foun∣taine of money) when either it is stopt in the passage by the force of their Enemies, or drawne out faster then it flowes by their owne
occasions; whereby also we often see that Gold and Silver is so scarse in Spaine, that they are forced to use base coppr money, to the great confusion of their Trade in want of supplies, and not without the undoing also of many of their owne people. BUt now that wee have seene the occasi∣ons by which the Spanish Treasure is dis∣persed into so many places of the world; it is The Spanish treasure which is exhausted either by com∣merce or warre, doth all come in the end into the generall Com∣merce of di∣vers Nations. needfull likewise to discover, how and in what proportion each Countrie doth partake of these monies: For wee find that Turkie, and divers other Nations have great plenty thereof, although they drive no Trade with Spaine, which seemes to contradict the former reason, where we say that this Treasure is ob∣tained by a necessitie of Commerce; but to cleare this point we must know, that all Na∣tions (who have no Mines of their owne) are inriched with Gold and Silver by one and the same meanes, which is already shewed to be the ballance of their forraigne trades, & this is not strictly tyed to be done in those Coun∣tries where the fountaine of Treasure is, but rather with such order and observations in the Trade and against excesse as are prescribed: for suppose England by Commerce with Spaine may get and bring home five hundred thou∣sand Ryalls of Eight yearely, yet if wee loose as much by our Trade in Turkie, and there∣fore
carry the money thither, it is not then the English, but the Turkes who have got this Treasure; although they have no Trade with Spaine, from whence it was first brought. A∣gaine if England having thus lost with Turkie, doe notwithstanding gaine twice asmuch by France, Italy, and other members of her gene∣rall Trade, then will there remaine five hun∣dred thousand Ryalls of Eight cleare gaines by the ballance of the same; and this com∣parison holds betweene all other Nations, both for the manner of getting, and the pro∣portion that is yearely gotten. But yet if a question should be made, whether all Nations get Treasure, and Spaine onely loose it▪ wee answer no; for some Countries by Warre or by excesse doe loose that which they had gotten, aswell as Spaine by Warre and want of Wares doth loose that which was its owne. ANd so much shall suffice to shew, that to partake in the Trade of the East-In∣dies, doth not onely weaken Spaniards Navi∣gation and strengthen our owne; but also to impeach him in this rich Trade, doth mighti∣ly exhaust his Treasure and increase our mo∣nies.
HAving done with the powerfull Spa∣niard, we must now say something of our professed friends, the Hol∣landers, who of late yeares are become a The Hollan∣ders greatnesse by Trade. flourishing People, Wealthy and strong, both by Sea and Land, by nothing else but Trade; and yet we know that they have little in their owne Countrie wherewithall to Trade; but wee must not therefore ima∣gine, that so great a building is either rai∣sed or can stand without a strong founda∣tion, which these industrious men wanting meanes in their owne Land, doe find out rich Mines in his Majesties Seas; Golden Mines wee may terme them, for so the Lords States themselves doe call them, and The Hollan∣ders best foun∣dation is the English Fi∣shing. thus also in their publicke Proclamations, which they have set forth in all occasions for the better preservation of this Fishing, a trea∣sure it is (indeed) inestimable, and an imploy∣ment most profitable: From hence originally proceeds the increase and maintenance of their People, their flourishing Arts, their private wealth, their publicke Treasure, the multitude of their Ships which fetch materials, to build ships, the swarmes of their small Vessels which catch Fish, to lade their great Ship which Trade with Fish; the proceed whereof doth furnish them with all their wants of forraigne Wares, and makes them all rich in Treasure; with which Treasure they doe also enlarge
their Trade into all the quarters of the world, whereby they are become the Magaznes for England, France, Spaine, Turkie, and other places, for Corne, Cordage, Ordnance, Powder, Shot, Ships, Wines, Fruits, Canvas, and many others, besides the rich Wares from the East and West-Indies, ser∣ving each Countrie according to their severall wants and occasions: In which course of Trade, they are not lesse industrious to sup∣plant others (especially the English) then they are careful to strengthen themselves with more then ordinarie diligence; for they know well, that, Trade hath raysed their fortune, and doth feed their Hopes; We desire not here to aggravate their Actions against us in the East Indies, for they are already too well knowne to all the world, but wee rather with patience expect the meanes of our satisfaction and fu∣ture safetie; wherein we doubt not of his Ma∣jesties most gracious favours and resolutions so well begun, and in so good away to settle & support a Trade of such great consequence; the which if the Hollanders might soly enjoy (as they endeavour) they would (by the power If our Trade to the East In¦dies should fall our other best Trades will fall with in. thereof) soone make themselves Masters (also) of our other best Trades into the Strights, and bee the onely Merchants even of our Cloath and other native Commodities into those Countries, as they are already possessed of the Exportation of (almost) all our Her∣rings,
Pilchards, and New-land Fish, to the maintenance of their Shipping and decay of ours, which is the more considerable because it may be wished, that Corn, & Victuals, might be exported, onely in English Shipping, but the Hollanders are diligent observers of such occasions as may give them advantage; they know well how to worke their owne ends in all places where they come; and as they have infi∣nitly prevailed in the augmentation of their Trade by the declination of other Nations, so they ayme at nothing more now then to weaken the English in their Trafficke, for we onely are their Corrivals, able to keepe them from the absolute Dominion of the Seas, wherein we may hope ever to prevaile, if we loose not the power we possesse, and the rich Trades, which wee have so well disco∣vered.
Whether it be not the best meanes wee have to en∣crease the Treasure or Money of this Kingdome. THis position is so contrarie to the common opinion, that it will require strong Arguments, to main∣taine and prove it, before it will be accepted, especially of the multitude, who bitterly ex∣claime when they see any Monies carried out of the Realme; affirming thereupon that wee have absolutely lost so much Treasure, being an Act against the long continued Lawes of this Kingdome, and that many other places, nay, Spaine it selfe (which is the fountaine of Money) forbids the Exportation thereof, some cases onely excepted. To all which wee might answer, that Venice, Florence, Genoa, Savoy, Mar∣cellis, Turkie, the Low-Countries, and divers o∣ther places permits it, their people applaudes it, and find great benefit by it; but all this makes a noyse and proves nothing: Wee must therefore come to those reasons which con∣cerne the businesse in question. FIrst, therefore wee will take that for gran∣ted which none will deny us, that we have
no other meanes to get Treasure but by For∣raigne We have no Treasure but by Trade. Trade, for Mines we have none which doe afford it, and how this Money is gotten in the mannaging of our said Trade, we have al∣ready shewed, that it is done By making our Com∣modities which are Exported, to over-ballance in Value the forraigne Wares which we consume; so that it resteth onely to shew how our monies may be added to our Commodities, and being joyntly exported may so much the more en∣crease our Treasure. ANd here we will suppose, that our yearely consumption of forraigne wares is to the valew of twenty hundred thousand pounds, and our exportations to exceed that two hun∣dred thousand pounds, which summe we may A neere esti∣mation of our yearely expor∣tations and importations, as they have bin found by good inquiry. thereupon affirme is brought to us in Treasure to ballance the accompt; but now if we adde three hundred thousand pounds more in ready mony unto our former exportation in wares, what profit can we have (will some men say) although by this meanes we should bring in so much ready mony more then we did before, seeing that we have carried out the like valew. TO this the answer is, that when we have prepared our exportations of wares, and sent out asmuch of every thing as wee can
spare or vent abroad; it is not therefore said, that then we should adde our money thereun∣to to fetch in the more money immediately, but rather first to inlarge our Trade therewith, by inabling us to bring in more forrain wares, which being sent out againe into the places of their consume, they will in due time much in∣crease our Treasure, for although in this man∣ner we doe yearely multiply our importations to the maintenance of more shipping and Mar∣riners, improvement of his Majesties Customs & other benefits, yet our consumption of those forraigne wares is no more then it was before: so that all the said increase of cōmodities brought in by the meanes of our ready mony sent out as is afore written, doth in the end become an ex∣portation unto us of a farre greater value then our said monies were, which is proved by three severall examples following. FIrst, we will suppose that one hundred thou∣sand pounds sterling being sent in our ship∣ping into the East Countries, will buy there one hundred thousand quarters of wheat cleare of all charges aboard the ships, which being af∣ter brought into England and housed, to export the same at the best time for vent thereof in Spaine, or Italy it cannot yeeld lesse in those parts then two hundred thousand pounds to make the Merchant but a faver, yet by this rec∣koning we see the Kingdome hath doubled that Treasure.
AGaine this profit will be far greater when we Trade thus with our money in remote The trade to the East Indies (in its propor∣tion) is the best trade and meanes wee have to in∣crease our Treasure. Countries, as for example, if we send one hun∣dred thousand pounds into the East-Indies to buy Pepper there and bring it hither, and from hence send it for Italy or Turky, it must yeeld five hundred thousand pounds at least in those places, in regard of the excessive charge which the Merchant disburseth in those long voya∣ges in shipping, wages, victuals, insuirance, in∣terest, customes, imposts, and the like: all which charges notwithstanding the King and the King∣dome gets. And we may here observe, that as the publike profit by forraigne Trade is the onely meanes whereby we gaine our Treasure: So this Trade to the East-Indies (in its pro∣portion) doth far excell all others. THe third example is, where the voyages are short and the wares rich, which there∣fore will not imploy much shipping, the pro∣fit to the Kingdome wilbe far lesse; as when an other hundred thousand pounds shall be im∣ployed in Turky, in raw silkes, and brought hi∣ther to be after transported from hence into France, the Low-Countries, or Germany, the Mer∣chant shall have good gaine although he sell it there for one hundred and fifty thousand pounds: and thus take the voyages all together in their Medium, the ready monies exported wil be returned unto us neer trebled. But if any man will yet object that these returnes come to
us in wares, and not really in monies as they were issued out. THe answer is, (keeping our first ground) that if our consumption of forraign wares be no more yearely then is already supposed, and that our exportations be so mightily en∣creased by this manner of Trading with ready money as is before declared: it is not then pos∣sible (in the course of trade) but that all the o∣ver-ballance or difference should returne either in money or in such wares as we must export againe; which as is already plainely shewed, will be still a greater meanes to increase our Trea∣sure: For it is in the stocke of a Kingdome, as in the estates of private men, who having store of wares, doe not therefore say that they will not venture out, or trade with their money, (for this were ridiculous) but doe also turne that into wares, whereby they multiply their money; and so by a continuall and orderly change of one into the other grow rich, and when they please, turne all their estates into Treasure, for they that have wares cannot want money, and therefore the former objection is not considerable: for what begot the monies which we sent out, but our wares? NEither is it said that money is the life of Trade, as if it could not subsist or passe currant without the same; for we know that there was great Trading by way of Commuta∣tion or Barter, when there was little Money
stirring in the world. The Italians and some o∣ther Nations have such remedies against this want, that it can neither decay nor hinder their Trade, for they transferre Bils of Debt, and have other wayes whereby they assigne their Credits from one to an other daily for very great summes with ease and satisfaction by Writing onely, whilst in the meane time, the Masse of Treasure which gave foundation, to those Credits is imployed in forraine Trade as a merchandize, which doth much increase Money inlar∣geth Trade, and Trade in∣creaseth mo∣ney. their trafficke. It is not therefore the keeping of our Money in the Kingdome, which makes a quicke and ample trade, but the necessity and use of our Wares in forraigne Countries, and our want of their Commodities which cau∣seth the Vent and consumption on all sides. WEe must not here forget the practise of the great Duke of Tuscany in his Port of Leghorne, which of late yeares from a poore towne is become a faire City, and one of the most famous places for trade in Christendom, by the resort of many Nations, but most espe∣cially by the English and Dutch with Mer∣chandize to a very great valew yearely, and yet it is worthy observation that the multitude of Ships and wares which come thither, have lit∣tle or no meanes to make their returnes from thence, but onely in ready money, which they may, and doe carry away freely at all times and without Custome, and such charges to the in∣credible
advantage, of the said Duke of Tusca∣ny and his Subjects, who are much inriched by the continuall great concourse of Merchants, from all the States of the neighbour Princes, bringing them plenty of money daily to sup∣ply their wants of the said wares. And thus we see that the Current of Merchandise which carries away their Treasure, becomes a flow∣ing streame to fill them againe in a greater measure with money. THe example of this growing greatnesse, hath lately moved the Duke of Savoy, pub∣lickely to declare his Princely resolution to all Nations, offering them many priviledges and immunities, that shall come to Trade in his free Port of Vila Franca, and especially a liberty to carry away ready monies for all the Wares they bring, or other occasions: and yet we know that neither in Tuscany or Savoy, are any Mines or monies more then they have and doe daily get by Trade; but they know like∣wise that if we yearely bring them wares (al∣though for a very great valew) the money will immediately follow, for, let no man doubt but that money must ever attend on Merchandize, for they goe together: and it is worthy the no∣ting that those Princes are content to part with their treasure only to enjoy the trade of the wares which are brought them, for which (to encourage the Merchant) they take no Cu∣stome; whereas we by sending out our money
doe gaine the imployment of our shipping, the Trade of the wares, and the profit of the Cu∣stoms which is a treble benefit. THere is yet an objection or two as weake as all the rest: The first is that if we trade with our money, we shall issue out the lesse wares, as if a man should say, those Countries which heretofore had occasion to consume our Cloath, Lead, Tynne, Iron, Fish, and the like, shall now make use of our monies in the place of those necessaries, which to affirme were most absurd, or that the Merchant had not rather carry out wares (by which there is ever some gaines expected) then to export mo∣ney, which is still but the same without any encrease. BUt on the contrary there are many Coun∣tries which may yeeld us very large and profitable Trafficke for our money, that o∣therwise afford us no trade at all because they have no use of our wares, as namely the East-Indies for one, in the first beginning thereof al∣though since by industry in our Commerce with those Nations we have brought them into the use of much of our Cloath, Lead, and o∣ther things, which is a good addition to the former vent of our Commodities. AGaine, some men have alledged that those Countries which permit money to be carried out, doe it, because they have few or no wares to trade withall: but we have great store
of Commodities, and therefore their action ought not to be our example. TO this the answer is briefly; That if wee have such a quantity of wares, as doth fully provide us of all things needfull from beyond the Seas, why should we then doubt that our monies sent out in trade must not necessarily come back again in Treasure, together with the great gains which it may procure in such man∣ner as is before set down? and on the other side if those Nations which send out their monies, do it because they have few wares of their owne; how come they then to have so much treasure as we ever see in those places, which suffer it free∣ly to be exported at all times and by whom so ever. We answer even by trading with their monies: For by what other means can they get it, having no mines of Gold or Silver? THus may wee plainely see, that when this waighty businesse is duely considered in its end (as all our humaine actions ought well Our humane actions ought especially to be considered in their ends. to be weighed) it is found much contrary to that which most men esteeme thereof, because they search no further then the beginning of this worke, which mis-informes their judge∣ments and leads them into errour: For if wee onely behold the actions of the Husbandman in the seed time, when he caseth away much good corne into the ground, we will rather ac∣count him a mad man then a Husbandman: but when we consider his labours in the Har∣vest,
which is the end of his indeavours; We find the worth and plentifull increase of his a∣ctions. Whether it be not an honour sutable to the Majestie of so great a King and Kingdome. WE have endeavoured upon all the former Quaeres to be as briefe as conveniently we might without obscurity, & now upon this last poynt there will be no occasion at all to inlarge; for when it shall be found that the trade to the East-Indies is so good a meanes to increase our strength, wealth, safety, & treasure, and that those discoveries have spread his Ma∣jesties fame into Persia, Iapan, China, the Domi∣nions of the great Magull, and many other re∣mote Nations of the Easterne world, there will be no deniall, but that these great blessings are so precious and honorable both to the King and his Kingdomes, that they ought to be pre∣served with our best endeavours against the strongest opposition. And for conclusion the East-India Compa∣nie doe humbly declare unto your Lordships and the honorable House of Commons, that they have not made their Petition and this Re∣monstrance for their own private ends, but for the publike good; And even so having perfor∣med their duties, they hope it shall be their sufficient discharge in all future times concer∣ning the Suppressing or Supporting of the said Trade.
