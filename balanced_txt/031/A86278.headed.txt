An Apologue for an Epilogue. I Shall here tel you what Rosie Crucians are, and that Moses was their Father, and he was ; some say they were of the order of Elias, some say the Disci∣ples of Ezekiel, others define them to be ; i.e. The Officers of the Generalissimo of the world, that are as the eyes and cares of the great King, seeing & hearing all things; they are Seraphically illuminated, as Moses was according to this order of the Elements, earth refin'd to water, water to air, air to fire; so of a man to be one of the Heroes of a Heros, a Daemon, or good ge∣nius, of a genius, a partaker of Divine things, and a com∣panion of the holy company of unbodied souls and im∣mortall Angels, and according to their vehicles, a ver∣satile life, turning themselves Proteus-like into any shape. But there is yet arguments to procure Mr. Walfoord, and T. Williams, Rosie Crucians by election, and that is the miracles that were done by them, in any sight; for it should seeme Rosie Crucians were not only initiated into the Mosaicall Theory, but have arrived also to the power of working miracles as Moses, Elias, Ezekiel and the succeeding Prophets did, as being transported where they please, as Habakkuk was from Jewry to Babylon or as Philip after he had baptized the Enuch to Arotus, and one of these went from me to a friend of mine in Devon∣shire, and came and brought me an answer to London the same day, which is four dayes journey, they taught
me excellent predictions of Astrologie, and earthquakes; they slack the plague in Cityes; they silence the violent winds and tempests; they calme the rage of the Sea and rivers; they walk in the Air, they frustrate the Malicious aspect of Witches; they cure all diseases; I desired one of these to tell me whether my complexion were capable of the society of my good Genius? when I see you again, said he, I will tell you (which is) (when he pleases to come to me, for I know not where to go to him) when I saw him then he said Ye should pray to God, for a good and holy man can offer no grea∣ter nor more acceptable sacrifice to God, then the obla∣tion of himself, his soul. He said also that the good Genii are as the benigne eyes of God, running to and fro in the world, with love and pitty beholding the innocent endeavours of harm∣less and single hearted men, ever ready to do them good, and to help them; and at his going away he bid me be∣ware of my seeming friends who would do me all the hurt they could, and cause the Governors of the Nati∣ons to be angry with me, and set bounds to my liberty, which truly hapned to me, as they did indeed: ma∣ny things more he told me before we parted, but I shall not name them here. For this Rosie Crucian Physick or Medicines, I happily and unexpectedly light upon in Arabia, which will prove a restauration of health to all that are afflicted wh that sickness, which we ordinarily cal natural, & all other diseases, as the Gour, Dropsie, Leprosie and falling sick∣ness; and these men may be said to have no small in∣sight in the body, and that Walfoord, Williams, and o∣thers of the Fraternity now living, may bear up in the same likely Equipage, with those noble Divine spirits their predecessors, though the unskilfullness in men commonly acknowledge more of supernaturall assistance
in hot unsetled fancies, and perplexed melancholy, then in the calme and distinct use of reason; yet for mine own part, but not without submission to better judge∣ments, I looke upon these Rosie Crucians above all men truly inspired, and more than any that professed or pre∣tended themselves so, this sixteen hundred yeares, and I am ravished with admiration of their miracles and transcendent mechanicall inventions, for the salving the Phaenomena in the world; I may without offence therefore compare them with Bezaliel and Aholiab, those skilfull and cunning workers of the tabernacle, who, as Moses testifies, were filled with the spirit of God, and therefore were of an excellent understanding to find out all manner of curious work. Nor is it any more argument, that these Rosie Cruci∣ans are not inspired, because they do not say they are; then that others are inspired, because they say they are; which to me is no argument at all; but the suppression of what so hapned, would argue much more sobriety & modesty; whenas the profession of it with sober men, would be suspected of some peice of melancholy and distraction, especially in these things, where the grand pleasure is the evidence and exercise of reason, not a bare beliefe, or an ineffable sense of life, in respect whereof there is no true christian but he is inspired; but if any more zealous pretender to prudence and righte∣ousness, wanting either leasure or ability to examine these Rosie Crucian Medicines to the bottom shall not∣withstanding either condemn them or admire them; he hath unbecommingly and indiscreetly vetered out of his own sphere, and I cannot acquit him of injustice or folly: Nor am I a Rosie Crucian, nor do I speake of spite, or hope of gain, or for any such matter; there is no cause, God knows, I envie no man, be he what he will be, I am no physitian, never was, nor never mean to be: what I am it
makes no matter as to my profession. Lastly, these holy and good men would have me know that the greatest sweet and perfection of a vertuous soul, is the kindly accomplishment of her own nature, in true wisdom and divine love; and these miraculus things that are done by them are, that that worth and knowledge that is in them may be taken notice of, and that God thereby may be glorified whose witnesses they are; but no other happiness accrues to them from this, but that hereby they may be in a better capacity of makeing o∣thers happy, From my house in Spittle fields next door to the red Lyon this 10. of May, 1658.

A New METHOD OF Rosie Crucian Physick. CHAP. I. Of the Accurate Structure of Mans body. I Admire the goodness of God towards us in the frame and structure of our bodies, the admi∣rable Artifice whereof, Galen, though a Na∣turalist, was so taken with, that he could not but adjudge the honor of a hymn to the wise Creator of it. The continuance of the whole, and every particular, is so evident an Argument of exquisite skill in the Maker, that if I should pursue all that sutes to my pur∣pose, it would amount to too large (yet an entire) Volume. I shall therefore write all that is needful to be known by all men, leaving the rest to be supply'd by Anatomists: And I think there is no man that hath any skill in that Art, but will confess, the more diligently and accurately the frame of our body is examined, it is found the more exquisitely conforma∣ble to our Reason, Judgement, and Desire; so that supposing
the same matter that our bodies are made of, if it had been in our own power to have made our selves, we should have fram'd our selves no otherwise then we are: To instance in some particulars; As in our Eyes, the Number, the Scituati∣on, the Fabrick of them is such, that we can excogitate no∣thing to be added thereto, or to be altered, either for their beauty, safety, or usefulness; but as for their beauty, I have trea∣ted largely of it in my youthful merry Poems, & now am not minded to transcribe my tender nice subject, and couple it with my severer stile; I will onely note how safely they are guarded, and fitly framed out for the use they are intended: The Brow and the Nose saves them from harder strokes; but such a curious part as the Eye being necessarily liable to mis∣chief from smallest matters, the sweat of the Forehead is fenced off by those two Wreaths of Hair which we call the Eye-brows; and the Eye-lids are fortified with little stiff bri∣stles, as with Pallisadoes, against the assault of Flyes and Gnats, and such-like bold Animalcula; besides, the upper-lid presently claps down, and is as good a Fence as a Port-Cullis against the importunity of the Enemy; which is done also e∣very night, whether there be any present assault or no, as if nature kept Garrison in this Acropolis of mans body, the Head, and look'd that such Laws should be duly observed, as were most for his safety. And now for the use of the Eye, which is sight, it is evi∣dent that this Organ is so exquisitely framed for that pur∣pose, that not the least curiosity can be added: For first, the Humor and Tunicles are purely transparent to let in light, and colours unfould, and unsophisticated by any inward tin∣cture. And then again, the parts of the Eye are made con∣vex, that there might be a direction of many raies coming from one point of the object, unto one point answerable in the bottom of the eye; to which purpose the Chrystalline hu∣mor is of great moment, and without which, the sight would be very obscure and weak. Thirdly, The Tunica uvea hath a Musculous Power, and can dilate and contract that round hole in it which is called the Pupil of the Eye, for the better moderating the transmission of light. Fourthly, The inside
of the uvea is blacked like the Wall of a Tennis-Court, the raies falling upon the Retina again; for such a repercussi∣on would make the sight more confused. Fifthly, The Ta∣nica Arachnoides, which invellops the Chrystalline Humour, by vertue of its Processus Ciliaros, can thrust forward, or draw back that precious useful part of the Eye, as the nearness or distance of the objects shall require. Sixthly and lastly, The Tunica Retina is white, for the better and more true recepti∣on of the species of things, (as they ordinarily call them) as white paper is fittest to receive those Images into a dark room; and the eye is already so perfect, that I believe it is not needful to speak any more thereof; we being able to move our head upwards and downwards, and on every side, might have unawares thought our selves sufficiently well provided for; but Nature hath added Muscles also to the Eyes, that no perfection might be wanting; for we have oft occasion to move our Eyes, our Heads being unmoved, as in reading, and viewing more particularly any object set be∣fore us; and that this may be done with more ease and ac∣curacy, she hath furnished that Organ with no lesse then six several Muscles; and indeed, this framing of Muscles, not onely in the Eye, but in the whole body, is admirable; for is it not a wonder that even all our flesh should be so handsom∣ly formed and contrived into distinct pieces, whose rise and insertions should be with such advantage that they do serve to move some part of the body or other? and that the parts of our body are not moved onely so conveniently as wil serve us to walk and subsist by, but that they are able to move e∣very way imaginable that will advantage us; for we can fling out Legs and Arms upwards and downwards, backwards, forwards, and round, as they that spin, or would spread a Mole-hill with their feet. To say nothing of Respiration, the constriction of the Diaphragme for the keeping down the Guts, and so enlarging the Thorax, that the Lungs may have play, and the assistance of the inward intercostal Muscles in deep suspirations, when we take more large gulps of air to cool our heart over-charged with love or sorrow; nor of the curious Fabrick of the Lainix, so well fitted with Muscles for
the modulation of the Voice, tunable speech, and delicious singing: You may adde to these the notable contrivance of the Heart, its two ventricles, and its many valvulae, so fram'd and scituated, as is most fit for the reception and transmissi∣on of the blood, and it's sent thence away warm to comfort and cherish the rest of the body; for which purpose also the valvulae in the veins are made. But we see by experience that joy and grief proceed not in all men from the same causes, and that men differ very much in the constitution of the body, whereby that which help∣eth and furthereth vital constitution in one, and is therefore delightful, hindereth & crosseth it in another, and therefore causeth grief. The difference therefore of Wits, hath its origi∣nal from the different passions, & from the ends to which the appetite leadeth them. As for that difference which ariseth from sickness, and such accidental distempers, I have appoin∣ted them for the second Part of this Book, and therefore I omit the same as impertinent to this place, and consider it onely in such as have their health, perfection of body, and Organs well disposed. CHAP. II. Of the perfection of the Body, and then of the Nature of the Sen∣ses; of Delight, Pain, Love, Hatred, sensual Delight, and Pains of the Body, Joy, and Grief. OTher things I have to say, but I will rather insist upon such things as are easie ahd intelligible even to Idiots, or such Physicians that are no wiser, who if they can but tell the Joints of their hands, or know the use of their teeth, they may easily discover it was Counsel, not Chance, that created them; and if they but understand these natural Medecines I have prepared in this Book for their example, they will know that they shall be cured of all Diseases without pain, or any great cost; and Love, not Money, was it that made me under∣take this Task. Now of the well-fram'd parts of our bo∣dy,
I would know why we have three joints in our Legs and Arms, as also in our fingers, but that it was much better then having but two or four? And why are our fore-teeth sharp, like Chizzels, to cut, but our inward teeth broad, to grind? but this is more exquisite then having them all sharp, or all broad, or the fore-teeth broad, and the other sharp; but we might have made a hard shift to have lived, though in that worser condition. Again, Why are the Teeth so luckily pla∣ced? or rather, Why are there not Teeth in other bones as well as in the Jaw-bones, for they might have been as capa∣ble as these. But the reason is, Nothing is done foollshly, nor in vain. I will shew you how to prolong life, and to return from age to youth; and how to change, alter, and amend the state of the body; but that I intend in a Treatise entituled The Wise Mans Crown: To keep the body in perfect health is my present de∣sign, and to cure all Diseases without reward; for there is a Divine Providence that orders all things. Again, (to say nothing of the inward curiosity of the Ear) Why is that outward frame of it, but that it is certainly known that it's for the better∣ing of our hearing? I might add, That Nature hath made the hind-most parts of our body (which we sit upon) most fleshy, as providing for our ease, making us a Natural Cushion, as well as for Instruments of Motion for our Thighs and Legs; she hath made the hinder part of the Head more strong, as being otherwise unfenced against falls and other casualties. She hath made the Back∣bon of several Vertebrae, as being more fit to bend, more tough, and less in danger of breaking then if they were all one intire bone, without those gristly Junctures. She hath strengthened our fingers and toes with Nailes, whereas she might have sent out that substance at the end of the first and second Joints, which had not been so handsom and useful, nay, rather somewhat troublesome and hurtful. And lastly, She hath made all bones devoid of sense, because they were to bear the weight of themselves, and of the whole body; and therefore if they had had sense, our life had been painful con∣tinually, and dolorous.
And now I have considered the fitness of the parts of mans bodie for the good of the whole, let me but consider briefly his sences and his nature, and then I intend more solidly to demonstrate the cause of all Diseases, and with that the Cure, because I intend a Method of Rosie Crucian Physick, promi∣sed in my way to Blisse. By our several Organs, we have se∣veral Conceptions of several qualities in the objects; for by sight we have a conception or image composed of colour and figure, which is all the notice and knowledge the object im∣parteth to us of its nature, by the excellency of the eye. By Hearing we have a conception called Sound, which is all the knowledge we have of the quality of the object from the Ear: And so the rest of the Sences are also conceptions of several qualities or natures of their objects. Because the Image in vision consisting of colour and shape, is the knowledge we have of the qualities of the object of that Sence, it is no hard matter for a man to fall into this o∣pinion, That the same colour & shape are the very qualities themselves; and for the same cause that sound & noise are the qualities of a piece of Canon or Culvering charged with sulphurous Powder, fired, or of the Air: And this opinion hath been so long received, that the contrary must needs ap∣pear a great Paradox. The same qualities are easier in a bell; and yet the introduction of species visible and intelligible, (which is necessary for the maintenance of that opinion) passing to and fro from the object, is worse then any Para∣dox, as being a plain impossibility. I shall therefore endea∣vor to make plain these points. That the subject wherein colour and image are inherent; is not the object or thing seen. That there is nothing (really) which we call an Image or Colour. That the said Image, or Colour, is but an apparation unto us of the motion, agitation, or alteration, which the object worketh in the brain, or spirits, or some internal substance of the Head. That as in vision, so also in conceptions that arise from the other senses, the subject of their inherence is not the object, but the continent.
That conceptions and apparitions are nothing really, but motion in some internal substance of the Head; which mo∣tion not stopping there, of necessity must there either help, or hinder the motion which is called Vital; when it helpeth it is called Delight, Contentment or Pleasure, which is no∣thing really but motion about the heart, as conception is nothing but motion in the head; and the objects that cause it are called Pleasant, or Delightful; and the same Delight, with reference to the object is called Love; but when such motion weakneth or hindreth the vital motion, then it is called Pain, and in re∣lation to that which causeth it, Hatred. There are two sorts of pleasures, whereof one seemeth to affect the corporeal Organ of the sence, and that I call sensual, the greatest part whereof is that by which we are invited to give continuance to our species; and the next by which a man is invited to meat, for preservation of his indi∣vidual person. The other sort of Delight is not particular∣ly any part of the body, and is called The Delight of the mind, & is that which we call Joy. Likewise of pains, some affect the body, and are therefore called The pains of the body; and some not, and those are called grief. CHAP. III. Of the nature of the Soul of Man, whether she be a meer Modi∣fication of the body, or a Substance really distinct; and then whe∣ther corporeal, or incorporeal, and of the temper of the bodie. HEre I am forced to speak what I have in my Familiar Spirit, and it is not impertinent to my purpose; there∣fore if we say that the soul is a meer modification of the body, the soul then is but one universal faculty of the body, or a many faculties put together; and those operations which are usually attributed unto the soul, must of necessity be attributed un∣to the body: I demand therefore, To what in the body will you attribute spontaneous motion? I understand thereby a pow∣er
in our selves of wagging, or holding still most of the parts of our body, as our hand suppose, or little finger: If you will say that it is nothing but the immission of the spirits into such and such Muscles, I would gladly know what does immit these spirits, and direct them so curiously; is it themselves? or the brains? or that particular piece of the brain they call the Pine-Kernel? What ever it be, that which doth thus immit them, and direct them, must have Animad∣version; and the same that hath Animadversion, hath Memory and Reason also: Now I would know whether the spirits them∣selves be capable of Animadversion, Memory, and Reason; for it indeed seems altogether impossible; for these animal spirits are nothing else but matter very thin and liquid, whose na∣ture consists in this, that all the particles of it be in motion, and being loose from one another, frigge and play up and down according to the measure and manner of agitation in them. I therefore demand which of these particles in these so ma∣ny loosly moving one from another, hath Animadversion in it? if you say that they all put together have; I appeal to him that thus answers, how unlikely it is that that should have Animadversion that is so utterly uncapable of Memory, and consequently, of Reason; for it is impossible to conceive memory competible to such a subject, as it is how to write Characters in the Water, or in the Wind. If you say the Brain immits and directs these spirits; how can that so freely and spontaneously move it self, or another, that hath no Muscles? Besides Doctor Culpepper tells you that though the Brain be the instrument of sence, yet it hath no sense at all of it self; how then can that that hath no sence di∣rect thus spontaneously and arbitrariously, the animal spirits in to any part of the body? an Act that plainly requires deter∣minate sense and perception: But let the Physicians and Anato∣mists conclude what they will, I shall, I think, little lesse then demonstrate that the brains have no sence; for the same in us that hath sence, hath likewise animadversion; and that which hath animadversion in us, hath also a faculty of free and arbi∣trarious Fancy and Reason.
Let us now consider the nature of the brain, and see how com∣petible those alterations are to such a subject; verily if we take a right view of this Laxe pith or marrow in mans head, neither our sence nor understanding can discover any thing more in this sub∣stance that can pretend to such noble operations, as free imagi∣nation and sagacious collections of Reason, then we can discern in a lump of fat, or a pot of honey; for this loose pulpe that is thus wrapped up within our Cranium, is but a spongie and porous bo∣dy, and pervious, not onely to the animal spirits, but also to more Juice and Liquor; else it could not well be nourished, at least it could not be so soft and moistned by drunkenness and excess, as to make the understanding inept and sottish in its operations. Wherefore I now demand, in this soft substance which we call the brain, whose softness implies that it is in some measure li∣quid, and liquidity implies a several motion of loosened parts; in what part or parcel thereof does Fancy, Reason, and Animad∣version lie? In this laxe consistence that lies like a Net, all on heaps in the water; I demand, In what Knot, Loope, or Interval thereof, does this faculty of free Fancy, and active Reason reside? I believe not a Doctor in England, nay, not Dr. Culpepper himself, were he alive, nor his men, Doctor Freeman, and the rest, can as∣sign me any; and if any will say, in all together; they must say that the whole brain is figured into this or that representation, which would cancel memory, and take away all capacity of there being any distinct notes and places for the several species of things there presented. But if they will say there is in every part of the brain this power of Animadversion and Fancy, they are to remember that the brain is in some measure a liquid body, and we must enquire how these loose parts understand one anothers several Animadversions and notions; and if they could (which is yet very unconceivable) yet if they could from hence do any thing toward the immission and direction of the animal spirits in∣to this or that part of the body, they must do it by knowing one anothers minds, and by a ioint contention of strength, as when many men at once, the word being given when they weigh An∣chor, put their strength together for the moving of that Massie body, that the single strength of one could not deal with; but this is to make the several particles of the brain so many indivi∣dual
persons; a fitter object for laughter, then the least measure of belief. Besides, how come these many Animadversions to seem but one to us, our mind being these, as is supposed? Or why if the fi∣guration of one part of the brain be communicated to all the rest, does not the same object seem situated both behind us, and before us, above, and beneath, on the right hand and on the left; and every way as the impress of the object is reflected against all the parts of the brains? but there appearing to us but one animadversion, and one sight of things, it is a sufficient Argument that there is but one; or if there be many, that they are not mutually communicated from the parts one to another, and therefore there can be no such joint endeavor towards one design; whence it is manifest, that the brains cannot immit or di∣rect these animal spirits into what part of the body they please. CHAP. IV. Of Spontaneous Motion; of the External Phaenomena; of the nature of the Essence of the Soul her self, what it is, and whether it be cor∣poreal, or incorporeal. NOW I must tell you, that the brain hath no sence, & there∣fore cannot impress spontaneously any motion on the ani∣mal spirits; it is no slight Argument that some being dissected, have been found without brains; and this I saw, a Captain in Chrisley, in Arabia that was accidentally kill'd by an Alcade, and an Arabian, the story is pleasant, but not pertinent to our pur∣pose; but this man had nothing but a limpid water in his head instead of brains, and the brains generally are easily dissolvable into a watery consistence, which agrees with what I intimated before. Now I appeal to any free Judge, how likely these liquid particles are to approve themselves of that nature and power, as to be able by erecting and knitting themselves together for a moment of time, to bear themselves so, as with one joint con∣tention of strength, to cause an arbitrarious obligation of
the spirits into this or that determinate part of the body; but the absurdity of this I have sufficiently insinuated already. The Nerves, I mean the Marrow of them, which is of the same substance with the brain, have no sence, as is demonstrated from a Catalepse, or Catchus; but I will not accumulate Argu∣ments in a matter so palpable. As for that little sprunt piece of the brain which they call the Conacion, that this should be the very substance, whose natural faculty it is to move it self, and by its motion and nods to determine the course of the spirits into this or that part of the body, seems to me no less foolish and fabulous then the Storie of this entituled Doctor Freeman, so much commended by ignorantly innocent people: If you heard but the magnificent storie that is told of the little lurking Mushrome, how it does not onely hear and see, but imagines, rea∣sons, commands the whole fabrick of the body more dexterously then an Indian Boy does an Elephant: what an acute Logician, subtile Geometrician, prudent Statesman, skilful Physician, and pro∣found Philosopher he is! and then afterwards by dissection you discover this worker of miracles to be nothing but a poor silly contemptible Knob, or Protuberancy, consisting of a thin Mem∣brane, containing a little pulpous matter, much of the same na∣ture with the rest of the Brain, Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici? Would you not sooner laugh at it, then go about to confute it? and truly I may the better laugh it now, having already con∣futed it in what I have afore merrily argued concerning the rest of the Brain. I shall therefore make bold to conclude, That the impress of Spontaneous Motion is neither from the animal spirits, nor from the Brain, &c. therefore that those operations that are usually attributed unto the soul, are really incompetible to any part of the body; and therefore, as in the last Chapter I hinted, I say, That the soul is not a meer modification of the body, but a sub∣stance distinct therefrom. Now we are to enquire, Whether this substance distinct from what we ordinarily call the body, be also it self a Corporeal Sub∣stance, or whether it be incorporeal? If you say that it is a cor∣poreal substance, you can understand no other then matter
more subtile and tenuious then the animal spirits themselves, mingled with them, and dispersed through the vessels and porosi∣ties of the body; for there can be no penetration of dimensi∣ons: But I need no new arguments to confute this fond conceit; for what I said of the animal spirits before, is applicable with all ease and fitness to this present case; and let it be sufficient that I advertise you so much, and so be excused from the repeating of the same things over again. It remains therefore that we conclude, That that which im∣presses Spontaneous Motion upon the body or more immediate∣ly upon the animal spirits: That which imagines, remembers, and reasons, is an immaterial substance, distinct from the body, which uses the animal spirits and the brain for Instruments in such and such operations. And thus we have found a spirit in a pro∣per notion and signification, that hath apparently these facul∣ties in it, it can both understand and move corporeal mat∣ter. And now this prize that we have won will prove for our de∣sign in this new Method of Physick and Philosophy of very great consequence; for it is obvious here to observe that the soul of man is as it were  a compendious statue of the Deity; her substance is a solid Essigies of God; and therefore as with ease we consider the substance and motion of the vast Heavens on a little Sphere, or Globe, so we may with like facility contemplate the nature of the Almighty in this little Model of God, the soul of Man, enlarging to Infinity what we observe in our selves when we transfer it unto God, as we do imagine these Circles which we view on the Globe, to be vastly bigger while we fancy them as described in the heavens. Wherefore we being assured of this, That there is a spiritual substance in our selves, in which both these properties do reside, viz. of the understanding, and of moving the corporeal matter; let us but enlarge our minds so as to conceive as well as we can of a spiritual substance that is able to move & actuate all matter whatsoever, never so far extended, and after what way & manner soever it please, and that it hath not onely the knowledge of this or that particular thing, but a distinct and plenary cognizance of all things; and we have indeed a very competent apprehen∣sion
of the nature of the eternal and invisible God, who like the soul of man, does not indeed fall under sence, but does every∣where operate so, that his person is easily to be gathered from what is discovered by our outward sences. CHAP. V. Of Plants; that the meer motion of the matter may do something, yet it will not amount to the production of Plants. That it is no botch in Nature that some Phaenomena be the results of Motion, others of substantial forms. That beauty is not a meer fancy, and that the beauty and vertue of Plants is an Argument that they are made for the use of our bodies from an intellectual princi∣ple. HOW weak is Man if you consider his nature, what faculties he hath, and in what order he is in respect of the rest of the creatures? And indeed, though his body be but weak and dis∣arm'd, yet his inward abilities of Reason, and artificial contri∣vance, is admirable, both for finding out those secret Medicines which God prepared for the use of Man in the Bowels of the Earth, of Plants and Minerals. And first of Vegetables, where I shall touch onely these four heads, their form and beauty, their seed, their signatures, and their great use, as well for medicines as sustenance; and that we may the better understand the advantage we have in this closer contem∣plation of the works of nature, we are in the first place to take notice of the condition of the substance, which we call matter, how fluid and slippery, and undeterminate it is of it self; or if it be hard, how unfit it is to be changed into any thing else; and therefore all things rot into a moisture before any thing can be generated of them, as we soften the wax before we set on the seal. Now therefore, unless we will be foolish, as because the uni∣form motion of the Air, or some more subtil corporeal Element, may so equally compress or bear against the parts of a little vaporous moisture, as to form it into round drops (as we see in the dew, and other experiments) and therefore because this
more rude and general motion can do something, to conclude that it does all things; We must in all reason confess that there is an eternal Mind and Vertue, whereof the matter is thus use∣fully formed and changed. But meer rude and undirected motion, because naturally it will have some kind of results, that therefore it will reach to such as plainly imply a wise contrivance of counsel, is so ridiculous a Sophism, as I have already intimated, that it is more fit to impose upon the inconsiderate souls of fool & children, then upon men of Mature Reason, and well exercised in Philosophy, or the grave and well practised, seraphically illuminated Rosie Crucians. Admit that Rain, and Snow, and Wind, and Hail, and Ice, and Thunder, and Lightning, and a Star I mention for example, that may be let in amongst Meteors, by some called Hellens-star, and is well known at Sea; I have seen it melt Copper Vessels a-board a ship; it cometh of an heap of such vapors as are carryed by violent cross Winds up from the Earth; and such like Meteors may be the pro∣ducts of heat and cold, or of the motion and rest of certain small particles of the matter; yet that the useful and beautiful contri∣vance of the Branches, Flowers, and Fruits of Plants should be so too, (to say nothing yet of Minerals, and the bodies of men) is as ridiculous and supine a collection, as to infer, That because meer heat and cold does soften and harden Wax, and puts it in∣to some shape or other, that therefore this meer heat and cold, or Motion and Rest, without any Art and Direction, made the Silver Seal too, and graved upon it so curiously some Coate of Arms, or the shape of some Bird or Beast, as an Eagle, a Lyon, &c. nay indeed this inference is more tolerable far then the o∣ther, these effects of Art being more easie, and less noble then those other of nature. Nor is it any deficiency at all in the Works of Nature, that some particular Phaenomena be but the easie results of that general motion communicated unto the matter from God; others the effects of more curious contrivance, or of the Divine Ar, or Reason, (for such are the , the Rationes Seminales) incorporated in the Matter, especially the Matter it self being in some sort vital, else it would not continue the motion that it is put upon, when it is occasionally this or the other way mo∣ved;
and besides the Nature of God being the most perfect ful∣ness of life that is possibly conceiveable, it is very congruous that this outmost and remotest shadow of himself, be some way, though but obscurely vital: Wherefore things falling off by degrees from the highest perfection, it will be no uneven or un∣proportionable step, if descending from the top of this utmost Creation, Man, in whom there is a more fine conception, or re∣flexive Reason, which hangs on, as every man hath so much experience as to have seen the Sun, and other visible objects by reflexion in the Water and Glasses; and this as yet shall be all I will say for this reason; I will give you more then I promised in the Contents, by four propositions concerning the nature of conceptions, and they shall be proved; and also of the main de∣ception of sence, that Colour and Image may be there where the thing seen is not: But because it may be said, That notwithstan∣ding the Image in the Water be not in the object, but a thing meerly phantastical, yet there may be colours really in the thing it self, I will urge further this experience, That divers times men see directly the same object double, as two Candles for one, which may happen from distemper, or otherwise without distemper if a man will; the Organs being either in their right temper, or equally distempered, the colours and images in two such characters of the same thing, cannot be inherent therein, be∣cause the thing seen cannot be in two places. One of these Images therefore is not inherent in the Object but the seeing, the Organs of the sight are then in equal temper or distemper, the one of them is no more inherent then the o∣ther, and consequently, neither of them both are in the Objects, which is the first proposition mentioned in the precedent num∣ber. Secondly, that the Image of any thing by reflexion in a glass, or water, or the like, is not any thing in, or behind the glass, or in, or under the Water, every man may grant to himself; which is the second proposition of Des Cartes. For thirdly We are to consider, first, That every great agitation or concussion of the brain (as it happeneth from a stroke, especially if the stroke be upon the eye) whereby the Optick Nerve suffereth a∣ny great violence, there appeareth before the Eyes a certain
light, which light is nothing without, but an apparition onely; all that is real being the concussion or motion of the parts of the Nerve; from which experience we may conclude, That ap∣parition of light is really nothing but motion within. If there∣fore from Lucid bodies there can be derived motion, so as to affect the Optick Nerve in such manner as is proper thereunto, there will follow an Image of light some-where in that line by which the motion was last derived to the eye, that is to say, In the object, if we look directly on it, and in the Glass or Wa∣ter, when we look upon it in the line of reflexion, which in effect is the third proposition, namely, That image and colour is but an apparition to us of that motion, agitation, or alteration, which the object worketh in the brain or spirits, or some inter∣nal substance in the head. But that from all lucid, shining, and illuminate bodies, there is a motion produced to the eye, and thorow the eye, to the Op∣tick Nerve and so into the Brain, by which the apparition of light or colour is effected, is not hard to prove. And first, it is evident that the Fire, the onely lucid body here upon Earth, worketh by motion equally every way, insomuch as the motion thereof stopped or inclosed, it is presently extinguished, and no more fire. And further, That that motion whereby the fire worketh, is dilation and contraction of it self alternately, com∣monly called Scintillation, or glowing, is manifest also by expe∣rience; from such motion in the fire must needs arise a rejection, or casting from it self off that part of the medium which is con∣tiguous to it, whereby that part also rejecteth the next, and so successively one part beateth back another to the very eye, and in the same manner the exteriour part of the eye presseth the interiour, (the Laws of refraction still observed.) Now the interior coat of the eye is nothing else but a piece of the Optick Nerve, and therefore the motion is still continued thereby into the Brain, and by resistance or re-action of the Brain, is also a rebound into the Optick Nerve again, which we not conceiving as motion or rebound from within, do think it is without, and call it Light, as hath been already shewed by the experience of a stroake: We have no reason to doubt that the Fountain of Light, the Sun, worketh by any other ways then the Fire, at least
in this matter; and thus all vision hath its original from such mo∣tion as is here described; for where there is no light, there is no sight; and therefore colour must be the same thing with light, as being the effect of the lucid bodies, their difference being one∣ly this, That when the light cometh directly from the Fountain to the eye, or indirectly by reflexion from clean and polite bo∣dies, and such as have not any polite bodies, and such as have not any particular motion internal to alter it, we call it light; but when it cometh to the eye by reflexion from uneven, rough, and course bodies, or such as are affected with internal motion of their own that may alter it, then we call it Colour; colour and light differing onely in this, that the one is pure, and the other perturbed light; by that which hath been said, not onely the truth of the third proposition, but also the whole manner of producing light and colour, is apparent. As colour is not inherent in the object, but an effect thereof upon us, caused by such motion in the object as hath been descri∣bed; so neither is sound in the thing we hear, but in our selves; one manifest sign thereof, is, That as man may see, so also he may hear double & trebble by multiplication of Ecchoes, which Ecchoes are sounds as well as the Original; and not being in one and the same place, cannot be inherent in the body that maketh them; nothing can make any thing which is not in it self; the Clapper of a Bell hath no sound in it, but motion, and maketh motion in the internal parts of the Bell; so the Bell hath motion and not sound, that imparteth motion to the air; and the aire hath motion, but not sound; the air imparteth motion by the ear and nerve unto the Brain; and the Brain hath motion, but not sound; from the Brain it reboundeth back into the Nerves outward, and thence it becommeth an Apparition without, which we call sound; And to proceed to the rest of the sences, it is apparent enough, that the smell and taste of the same thing are not the same to every man, and therefore are not in the thing smelt or tasted, but in the men; so likewise the heat we feel from the fire is manifestly in us, and is quite different from the heat which is in the fire; for our heat is pleasure or pain, according as it is great or moderate; but in the cool there is no such thing: By this the last is proved, viz. that as in vision,
so also in Conceptions that arise from other senses, the subject of their inherence is not in the object, but in the Sentinent; And from hence also it followeth that whatsoever accidents or qualities our sences make us think there be in the world, they be not there, but are seeming and apparitions only; the things that really are in the world without us, are those motions by which these seemings are caused; and this is the great deception of sence, which also is to be by sence corrected: for as sence telleth me when I see directly, that the colour seemeth to be in the object; so also sence telleth me when I see by reflection, that colour is in the object. But now I am out of the way from the outward Creation of Man, in whom there is a princi∣ple of more fine and reflexive reason, which hangs on, though not in that manner, in the more perfect kinde of Brutes, as sence also (loth to be curbed with too narrow compass) layes hold upon some kinde of plants, as in those sundry sorts of Zoo∣phyta, but in the rest there are no further footsteps discovered of an animadversive forme abiding in them; yet there be the effects of an inadvertent forme () of materiated or incorporated Art or seminal Reason; I say it is no uneven jot to pass from the more faint and obscure example of Sperma∣tical life, to the more Considerable effects of general Motion in Mineralls, Metalls, nor yet to say any thing of the Medicines extracted, mortified, fixt, dissolv'd and incorporated with their proper Veagles, because we have intended it our last business to return to Mineralls, Mettals, and sundry Meteors, whose easie and rude shapes have no need of any particular principle of life, or Spermatical form distinct from the rest, or motion of the particles of the matter. But there is that curiosity of form and beauty in the more noble kinde of Plants, bearing such a sutableness and harmony with the more refined sence and sagacity of the soul of Man, that he cannot choose (his intellectual touch being so sweetly gratified by what it deprehends in such like objects,) but ac∣knowledge that some hidden cause much a-kin to his own nature that is intellectual, is the contriver and perfecter of these so pleasant spectacles in the world. Nor is it at all to the purpose to object that this business of
Beauty and comeliness of proportion is but a conceit, because some men acknowledge no such thing, and all things are alike handsome to them, who yet notwithstanding have the use of their eyes as well as other folks; for I say, this rather makes for what we aim at, that Pulchritudo is conveyed indeed by the outward sences unto the soul, but a more intellectual faculty is that which relishes it; as an Astrologicall, or better, a Geometricall Scheam is let in by the eyes, but the Demonstration is discern'd by Reason: And therefore it is more rational to af∣firm, that some intellectual principle was the Author of this Pulchritude of things, then that they should be thus fashion'd without the help of that principle: And to say there is no such thing as Pulchritude, and some say, there is no way to felici∣ty; The first, I answer, is because some mens souls are so dull and stupid. And the second is that they never knew The way to bliss, The first cannot relish all objects alike in that respect; The se∣cond knows not Happiness, nor the way to long life, nor the means to Health, nor how to return from Age to Youth, &c. which is as absurd and groundless as to conclude there is no such thing as Reason and Demonstration, because a natural fool cannot reach unto it. But that there is such a thing as The way to Bliss, Long life, and a certain way to Health, not as yet known in Eng∣land, I will demonstrate in a Treatise by it self; The way to Health I shall shew you anon in this book, the rest in another Part, as I promised you. Now that there is such a thing as Beauty, and that it is ac∣knowledged by the whole generations of men, to be in Trees, flowers and fruits, and the adorning of buildings in all Ages, is an example, and undenyable testimony; for what is more and ordinary with them then taking in flowers and fruitage for the garnishing of their work? Besides I appeal to any man that is not sunk into so forlorne a pitch of Degeneracy; that he is as stupid to these things as the basest of Beasts, whether for exam∣ple, a rightly cut Tetraerum, cube or Icosadrum, have no more pulchritude in them, then any rude broken sone lying in the field or high-wayes; Or to name other solid Figures which though they be not regular properly so called, yet have a setled Idea, & Nature, as a Cone, Sphere, or Cylinder, whether the sight of these
do not gratifie the mindes of men more, and pretend to more elegancy of shape, then those rude cuttings or chippings of free-stone that fall from the Masons hands, and serve for nothing but to fill up the middle of the wall, and so to be hid from the eyes of Man for their ugliness: And it is observable, That if Nature shape any thing neer this Geometrical accuracy, that we take no∣tice of it with much content and pleasure, as if it be but exactly round, as there be abundance of such stones upon Mesque, a hill in Arabia, I have seen them there, or ordinarily Quinquan∣gular, or have the sides but parallels, though the Angles be une∣qual, as is seen in some little stones, and in a kinde of Alablaster found here in England, and other pretty stones found upon Bulverton-hill neer Sidmouth in Devonshire; and neer Stratford upon Avon, and in Tyms Grove at Colton in Warwickeshire, are found such stones that grow naturally carved with various works, some with Roses, others with Lyons, Eagles, and all manner of delightfull works; These stones I say, gratifie our sight, as having a nearer cognation with the soul of man that is rational and intellectual, and therefore is well pleased when it meets with any outward object that fits and agrees with those congenite Ideas her own nature is furnished with: For Symme∣metry, Equality, and Correspondency of parts, is the discernment of Reason, not the object of Sence, as I have in another place proved. Now therefore it being evident, that there is such a thing as Beauty, Symmetry and Comeliness of proportion, (to say nothing of the delightful mixture of colours, and that this is the proper object of the Understanding and Reason; for these things be not taken notice of by the Beasts) I think I may safely inferre, that whatsoever is the first and principal cause of changing the fluid and undeterminated Matter into shapes so comely and symmetrical, as we see in flowers and trees, is an understanding Principle, and knowes both the nature of man, and of those objects he offers to his sight in this outward and visible world, and would have man search and finde out those secrets by the which he might keep his body in health many hundreds of years, and at last find the way to Bliss; for these things cannot come by chance, or by a Multiranious attempt of the parts of the matter
upon themselves, for then it were likely that the species of things though some might hit right, yet most would be maim∣ed and ridiculous; but now there is not any ineptitude in any thing which is a sign that the fluidnesse of the matter is guided and determined by the overpowering counsel of an eternall mind. If it were not needlesse, I might instance in sundry kinds of flowers herbs and trees; but these objects being so obvious, and every mans fancy being brauched with the remembrance of Roses, Marigolds, Gelliflowers, Pionies, Tulips, Pausies, Primroses, the leaves and clusters of the Vine &c. Of all which you must con∣fess that there is in them beauty and symetry, and use in Physick, and gratefull proportion; I hold it superfluity to weary you with any longer induction, but shall pass on to those considera∣tions behind, of their seed, signaure and usefullness, and shall pass through them very briefly, and then I shall come to minerall Medicines, these observables being very necessary first to be known by way of an Introduction, and as ordinary and easily Intelligible.
CHAP. VI. Of the Seeds and Signatures of Plants, and wherefore GOD made them. EVery plant hath its seed; Rosie Crucians therefore say there are secret Mysteries lye hidden in them, which should be our delight to find out; for Divine Providence made all good for the use of man: And this being no necessary result of the mo∣tion of the matter, as the whole contrivance of the plant indeed is not; and it being of great consequence that they have Seed for the continuance of propagation of their whole Species, and for the gratifying of mans Art also, industry and necessitie, (for much of Husbandry and Gardening lies in this) it cannot but be the Act of Counsel to furnish the several kinds of Plants with their Seeds, especially the Earth being of such a nature that though at first for a while it might bring forth all manner of Plantts, (as some will have it also to have brought forth all kinds of Animals) yet at last it would grow so sluggish, that without the advantage of those small compendious principles of gene∣ration, the Grain of Seed would yeild no such births, no more then a Pump grown dry will yeild any Water, unless you pour a little Water into it first, and then for so many Basons full, you may fetch up as many Tankards full. Nor is it material to object that stinking Weeds, and poy∣sonous Plants bear Seed too, as well as the most pleasant and use∣ful; for even those stinking Weeds, and poysonous Plants have their use in Rosie Crucian Physick, as you shall know hereafter; be∣sides our common Physick-Mongers often use them as their Fan∣cy guides them, grounded upon no other reason then woful and deadly experience; sometimes the industry of man is exercised by them to weed them out where they are hurtful, which reasons if they seeme fleight, let us but consider, that if hu∣mane industry had nothing to conflict and struggle with, the fire of mans spirit would behalf extinguished in the flesh, and then we shall acknowledge that that which I have alledged is not so contemptible nor invalid. But secondly, Who knows but it is so with poysonous Plants, as vulgarly is fancyed concerning Toads, and other poysonous
Serpents that lick the Venom from off the Earth? So poyso∣nous Plants may well draw to them all the Maligne Juice and nourishment, that the other may be more pure and defae∣cate, as there are Recepticles in the body of man, and Emuncto∣ries to drain them of superfluous Choler and Melancholy, &c. Lastly, It is very well known by them that know any thing in Nature and Physick, That those Herbs that the rude and igno∣rant would call Weeds, are the materials of very soveraign Me∣dicines, that Aconitum Hyemale, or Winter Wolfs bain, that other∣wise is rank poyson, is reported to prevail mightily against the biting of Vipers, Scorpions, and mad dogs, which Sir Christo∣pher Heydon assenteth unto; and that that plant that bears death in the very Name of it, Solanum Lethiferum, prevents death by procuring sleep, if it be ayplyed in a Fever; nor are those things to be deemed uprofitable, say the Rosie Crucians, whose use our heavy ignorance will not let us understand; but they will teach us as followeth. We come now to the signatures of plants, which indeed re∣spects us more properly and adaequately then the other, and is a Key (as Rosie Crucians say) to enter man into the knowledge and use of the Treasures of nature; I demand therefore, Whether it be not a very easie and Genuine inference from the observing that several herbs are marked with some mark or sign that intimates their vertue, what they are good for; and there being such a creature as man in the World that can read & understand these signs and characters, hence to collect that the Author both of man and them, knew the nature of them both; and besides di∣vine providence would onely initiate and enter mankind in the useful knowledge of her Treasures by the Seraphical illumina∣ted Rosie Crucians, leaving the rest to employ the vulgar that they might not be idle; for the Theater of the World is an ex∣ercise of mans wit, and therefore all things are in some measure obscure and intricate; that the sedulity of that divine spark, the soul of man, may have matter of conquest and triumph, when he hath done bravely by a superadvenient assistance of God. But that there be some plants that bear a very evident signa∣ture of their nature and use, for example, Capillus veneris, Poli∣trichon, or Maiden-hair; the Lye in which it is sodden or infus'd,
is good to wash the head, and make the hair grow in those places that are bare; the decoction of Quinces, which are a downey and hairy Fruit, is accounted good for the fetching again hair that hath been fallen by the French Pox; the Leaf of Balm and Al∣leluia, or Wood-Sorrel, as also the roots of Anthora, represent the heart in figure, and are Cordiacal. Walnuts beare the whole signature of the head; the outward green Cortex answers to the Pericranium, and a Salt made of it is singular good for Wounds in that part, as the Kernel is good for the Brains, which it resembles. Vmbelicus Veneris is powerful to provoke lust, as Doctor Culpep∣per affirms; as also your several sorts of Satyrions, which have the evident resemblance of the genetal parts upon them; Aron especially, and all your Orchisses, that they have given Names unto, from some beast or other, as Cynosorchis, Orchis Miodes, Tragorchis, &c. the last whereof notoriorious for its Goatish smell, and Tufts not unlike the Beard of that Lecherous Ani∣mal, is of all the rest the most powerful incentive to lust. The Leaves of Hypericon are very thick pricked, or pointed with little holes, and it is a singular good Wound-herb, as use∣ful also for de-obstructing the pores of the body. Scorpioides, Echium, or Scorpions grasse, is like the crooked Tayle of a Scorpion; and Ophioglossum, or Adders Tongue, hath a very plain and perfect resemblance of the Tongue of a Serpent; as also Ophioscorodon of the intire head and upper-parts of the body; and these are all held very good against poyson, and the biting of Serpents; and generally all such plants as are speckled with spots like the Skins of Vipers, or other venemous creatures, are known to be good against the stings or bitings of them, and are powerful objects against poyson. Thus did divine providence by natural Hieroglyphicks, read short Lectures to the rude wit of vulgar man; others of the Se∣raphically illuminated Fraternity, being entred, and sufficiently experienced of these, found out the rest, it being very reasona∣ble that other herbs that had not such signatures, might be ve∣ry good for Medicinal uses, as well as they that had. Rosie Crucians have quickned and actuated their Phlegmatick natures to more frequent and effectual venery; for their long
lives health, & youthfulness, shews they were not very fiery, to say nothing of their happinesse, riches, wisdom and vertue, because I have in my Treatise of The way to blisse, spoken of it largely. CHAP. VII. Of the usefulnesse of Plants, and of the Works of God. YOu shal now briefly take notice of the usefulnes & profitable∣ness of plants both for Physick and Food, and then pass on to the consideration of the inspired Rosie Crucians, what their Medicines are: As for the common uses of Plants, Herbals teach you something; but I refer you to the singular Medicines of Rosie Crucians in my Book of The way to bliss for the salvation of your health, Animals know as much by instinct and nature; and that which is most observable here, is this, That brute Beasts know as much as many Physicians do that are taught by Herbals onely; and these deny the power of God in the Works of Na∣ture, and the power of Nature in the skill of man, that it should be impossible to make Trees bear fruit in December, and Apple-trees to grow to blossom, and bear Apples contrary to kind in March. Beasts have knowledge in the vertue of Plants as well as men, for the Toad being overcharged with the poyson of the Spider, (as is well known) hath recourse to the Plantane-Leaf. The Weasel when she is to encounter the Serpent, arms her self with eating of Rue. The Dog when he is sick at the stomack, knows his cure, falls to his grass, vomits, and is well. The Swallows make use of Celandine, the Lennet of Euphragia for the repair∣ing of their sight. And the Ass when he is oppressed with melan∣choly, eats of the Herb Asplenium, or Miltwast & so eases himself of the swelling of the spleen. The Raven makes use of Cinquefoyle for the prolongation of his life to somtimes six or sevenhundred years; and therefore I think it is that the Rosie Crucians prescribe the oyle of Ravens, Swallows, and Harts for the use of man to annoint himself, to continue his flesh and well-complexioned body from wrinkles and lameness; and Dictamnum Cretense is much used, as I told you in my Wise mans Crown; Cretian Ditta∣ny cures Wounds of what nature soever.
Which thing I conceive no obscure indigation of provi∣dence; for they doing that by instinct and Nature, which men who have free Reason cannot but acknowledge to be very pertinent and fitting, nay such that the skilfullest Physici∣an will approve and allow; and these creatures having no such reason and skill themselves as to turn Physicians, it must needs be concluded by vertue of that principle that contrived them, and made them of that Nature they are, enabled them also to do these things. Let us now consider the Fruits of the Trees, where I think it will appear very manifestly, That there was one worker of Mira∣cles, and inspirer of Rosie Crucians; I might now reach out to Exortick-Plants, such as the Cinamon-Tree, the Balsome-Tree, and the Tree that bears the Nutmeg, invelopped the Mace; as also the famous Indian Nut-Tree, which at once (as the Rosie Cru∣cians say) affords almost all the necessaries of life; for if they cut but the Twigs at Evening, there is a plentiful and pleasant Juice comes out, which they receive into Bottles, and drink in∣stead of Wine, and out of which they extract such an Aquae Vitae as is very soveraign against all manner of sicknesses, the branches and boughs they make their Houses of, and the body of the tree being very spongy within, though hard without, they easily contrive into the frame and use of their Canoes, or boats. the Kernel of the Nut serves them for bread and meat, and the Shells for Cups to drink in; and indeed they are not meer empty Cups, for there is found a delicious cooling milk in them; be∣sides there is a kind of hemp that incloses the Nut, of which they make Ropes and Cables, and of the finest of it, Sayles for their ships; and the Leaves are so hard and sharp pointed, that they easily make Needles or Bodkins of them for stitching their Sayles, and for other necessary purposes; and that Providence may shew her self benigne as well as wise, this so notable a Plant is not restrain'd to one coast of the World as the East-Indies, but is found in Affrica, Arabia, and in all the Islands of the West-Indies, as Hispaniola, Cuba, where our men are victorers; and several other places of the new-found World. But I thought fit to insist upon these things by way of intro∣duction, but to contain my self within the compass of such
objects as are necessary for our knowledge, and familiarly and ordinarily before our eyes, that we may the better (these things understood) take occasion from thence to demonstrate the Ro∣sie Crucian way to health, and their ordinary Medicines which to us are not as yet known. CHAP. IX. The Rosie Crucian way how to get health; The causes why we eat food; Of the first nature of the World; A measure of raw and tem∣perate meat, and the cause of the fiery, and soummy Gall and needless muddy bowels the melt; nature careless of making the reins of Urine drawers, drinkless animals have none at all; how to clense your self from these idle Bowels and avoid all diseases. DO you not consider the weaknesse of man, what faculties he hath, and in what order he is in respect of the rest of the creatures; Rosie Crucians observe though his body be weake and disarmed, yet his inward abilities of reason, and artificiall contrivance is admirable; he is much given to search out the Medicinall virtues of Plants, Wights, and Mineralls, and hath found out those that were of so present and great con∣sequence as to be Antidotes against poyson that would so quickly have dispatched mankind, it were good for us to de∣monstrate the Rosie Crucian Medicines, now our land is afflict∣ed with a sickness called the new disease, of which all sorts dye, with∣out remedy, for none as yet have prescribed a Medicine, for young men that desire to live, and for old men that wish for health, without which no life is sweet and savory, then let us bend our selves to cure our brethren first, and endeavour to shew the means (besides the commmon Collegian Doctors drenches, or Culpepers way, how every man may get and keep his health, that is something strange but a vowed truth; the consent & equall (I mean agreeable to kind) temper & dulling our four first beginnings, the staff of our bodies, for if this knot be
broken, & they loos towards their former liberty, they wax proud and strong, and fight, for their nature is together by the ears, and put us to pain, and lets the rule of nature, and this they call the disease. Then to handle one at once as our manner is, and will keep our custom still, to keep our health and body in temper, seems no such matter to me as the world would make it, even plain∣ly impossible, when I know all the wayes and entries to let in diseases and distempers of the body, may by small heed be stoped and fenced. Wee must needs draw breath and eat meat; for the cause I shall speake of it in its place; and as this is not all clear and agreeable, so nature hath her leavings; and again labour and rest are needful, and perhaps we cannot chuse but be moved in mind with joy, greife, fear, hope, and such like passions, though the Stoick deny necessity, saith Des Carte. By so many wayes and gats diseases may enter, if they be not well watced and looked unto, which may be done in reason, and hath been done often, as they assure us that have lived long without all disease and sicknesses, as Iohn Harding relates of a Minister called Iohn Macklaine to have con∣tinued for these fourscore years last past together in health, & af∣ter his hair, teeth, eys & flesh renued, & became yong again, & such like stories are to be found enough if we might stay to seek them; some are contented for all but air and meat, but these say they have often seeds of diseases lye hid in them unable to be fore∣seen or prevented, as we find those meats that make the finest shew, (as Wine and Sugar) and such enticeing baites, to have hid in them most hateful diseases and dregs in the bottom; so the air when it seems the best and highest, yet is sometimes infected and poysoned with venemous breath sent out and thrust into it either from below or from the scars of Hea∣ven, and as the cause is hidden and unknown to us, so the hurt impossible to be avoyed and prevented. If I list to let my speech run at large, especialy in o∣ther mens grounds, I could finde that that Division is false, first, (to come to meat anon) and then if it were
true, yet the cause of that infection not unable to be foreseen and warded; but I am so sorry for the fault above, that I can the better take heed hereafter; yet methinks it is a grief to hear the harmless and glorious divine things above so defaced with stan∣der, and no man makes answer for them. Gentle Reader, be pleased to stay a little; If the Stars have no light, and so no power but from the Sun, that most wholsome and prosperous creature, then they hurt him most wrongfully, and reprove themselves very rightly. And again, if they be but a piece of the finer part; and first nature, as it were, of the World, as I have shewed in my Book of the The Wise Mans Crown, then they be the wholsomest things in the World; so far be they from poysoned slander: And so let their Lights be ne∣ver so grosly mingled in their meetings, and thereby that state of the Weather changed suddenly, and from thence our bodie's troubled and turned into Diseases, because they were not prepared and made ready for it, yet the things are good and prosperous; and by knowledge of Astrology, or influ∣ences of the Planets, and races of the stars, we may prepare our selves, and prevent all, if we cannot have that happiness to con∣verse with our Guardian Genius. Now for lower reflexion, it is not worth the answering when there is so much waste ground in the World; then let us pass over to that other Breach; may we not shun the leaving baits in our Dyet, and take such meat as is most temperate and near our Nature, and then dress the same after the most kindly and wholsome manner, seasoning it well with labour, mirth and sleep? And to be plain, I have shewed in another Treatise of mine, entituled, The way to blisse, so much noted by our Writers, what a jewel of health it were to use all raw & temperate meat, or be∣caus we be wise & vertuous, and this Dyet would perhaps change our Nature of fire, but like Philosophers, a quite contrary way; taking the best, when as none is lost, and leaving the worst, which is that we now take, a Way I say, to strip of all grossness and foulness of bodies, the only hurt of themselves, and is the Food of all Diseases. I will tell you another way which you will think strange, but you shall find it true; if the meat be temperate, as I bid you
chuse it, there is no hurt can come thereby, (if you keep mea∣sure in your selves) save from your leavings; these in so clear a Dyet first will be very few; but if you would be ruled by my Counsel which Nature taught me, those few should never hurt you. Of all the Leavings in the body, there are three which the li∣ver maketh most troublesome unto us, (for the rest are easily dispatched) a light and easie, or rather a fiery (as some call) Choller; a cold and heavy mud, called Melancholly; and the third is Vrine, which I wil treat of in the next Chapter but those two the worser, and this fault is not in themselves, but all by reason of the needless and hurtful bowels in our bodies, (as the Seeds-man useth to sow good and bad together) which being of the same kind and quality with those humors, do draw and pul them stil unto them (as all other parts and things do) for their Food and nourishment and so by the narrow passages to and fro, their greediness in pulling and holding, and a hundred such means, subject to great mischances, have brought in as many mischiefs, whereas Nature the great expeller of her unlike, and Enemies, if she had free choice and liberty, would otherwise with case, and without hurt, expel those Leavings, especially so small a number of the better sort in so clean a Dyet; nay, set the ma∣lice of those parts, (those parts are Melt-Gall, and Reins) if there be not sufficient store of other soul meat at hand, like a poysoned or a purging Medicine, they use to draw good Juices, and to make Food of them; what is not manifested in this chap∣ter, shall methodically be demonstrated in the ensuing, for I in∣tend to be serious in this part of my Book, and will shew you what Nature taught me.
CHAP. X. Rosie Crucian Medicines made plain by examples, and those are a∣bove controlement; That the wet Sun-beams declare some fine and forrain fatness to nourish mankind. How to live twenty yeers without Food, as many creatures do. Vse and Custom a second Nature: The Bird called Manuda Diaoa, and the singing Dog, and Camelian that never eat food. An experienced Medicine, and how to apply it, Paracelse, and the Rosie Crucian new Art of Healing. OF Aristotle it is reported, That he is the witty Spye of Na∣ture, and as if he had been made in this matter, he shews the need and use of the greater Entralls and Bowels of Wights, and saith very truly and wisely, The Heart and Liver as the spring of Life and Food, to be needful for all VVights, adding to the hot∣ter one, the Brain to cool, and the Lights to clense the Heat, stay∣ing there as if he thought the other three unprofitable; nay for one of them in the same Book, (I say) telling the stories of the Hart and Camel, and giving the reason why they be both so swift, healthful, long-liv'd and other good properties above the rest enfeoffed, vouched in plain tearms, the want of the fiery and scummy Gall, as a great Enemy to them, for the Melt that muddy Bowel, that it may be left out as needless in the bodies of the better creatures. The Meadows near Cortinae and Mugga∣dore declare when by a strange and hidden vertue they bereave the Beasts thereof that graze upon them of it; the Herb is called Asplenium; as I told you in the preceding Chapters, nay, that the Milt is not onely idle, but hurtful, which all experience, even in our selves hath taught it. The Turks light Footmen, (I say, which I know not by what example unless it were the want of the same in the Camel, ma∣king the Beast able to travel an hundred miles a day, and so without drink fifteen dayes together) being in their childhood purged of their Milt, prove thereby the most light, swift, sound and lasting Footmen in the World.
As for the veins of Urine-drawers, as drinkless creatures have none at all, so some men have but one of them, as if nature pas∣sed not to make any at all; if we could forbear our drink (as these Beasts do by kinde, and some men by custom) we might the better spare them, and avoid many mischiefs in our bo∣dies. Therefore the odd man, Paracelsus, I know not by what light, if not of the Rosie Cross, (cast in I think from seraphical illumination) not onely sees these faults, but also finds wayes to amend them, and to cut the mischiefs off all these three noy∣some parts, not with any yeilding Craft, but with Rosie Cruci∣an divine kind of Healing, with Aurum protabile, &c. so that to avoid all diseases that spring of the Leavings, take of Aurum potabile, one ounce; one pound of the Oyle of Ravens; two pound of Miltwast, or Asplenium; a handful of Cinkefoyle, of Dictamnum Cretense, Ophioglossum and Scorpioides, Echium, of each a like quantity, and observe the Ascendent, and his Lord; and the Moon, and Lord of the sixt, at your discretion, and take the quantity of a Walnut every night and morning, and anoynt the face & hands, & (if you wil) the rest of the body: Ro∣sie Crucians have other healing and yeilding Medicines, you shall know them in their places; this is such an experienced Medicine, that you know where to find it; I need not shew you to put out the sway and power of these idle bowels, or perhaps it should not need, and in a stock that easeth our clean Dyet Nature her self as she doth in those Meadows by other creatures would also quite raze and dispatch them within a few generations.
But I will go further, Hear a Rosie Crucian new and unheard of opinion, and yet let not your judgement run, before you see good reason; What if we could fast for ever, and live without all food? might not all hurt and danger of meat be then forestalled? if other Creatures, whose life hangeth upon the same hold, by the sufferance, nay by the commandement of God and Nature, do last for ever, there is no Reason but the same common Nature will at last suffer it in us; Let us see. And to step over the Came∣lion, because it is a Cold and bloodless Creature; what say we to a Bird, which is an hot and perfect one? a bird in the Molucco Islands, Manuda Diaca by name, that hath no feet at all, no more then an ordinary fish, as Mr. Moore saith, and I have seen her; the bigness of her body and bill, as likewise the form of them, is much what of a Swallows, but the spreading out of her wings and Tail has no less compass then an Eagles; she lives and breeds in the Aire, born up by the force of wind with more ease then Archytas his Dove, and comes not near the earth but for her Burial; for the largeness and lightness of her wings and tail sustain her without Lassitude, and the laying of her Egges and brooding of her young is upon the back of the Male, which is made hollow, as also the breast of the Female, for the more easie incubation, taking no other food, as alas how should she? then there is found: but whe∣ther she lives meerly of the dew of Heaven, or of flies and such like insects, I leave to others to dispute. Nay, have you not heard of the Little Dog in the West Indies, which singeth so sweetly all the night long, neither night nor day eating any thing? But there be examples in our kind as well, then it is certain above controlment: Sir Christopher Heydon saith there is a Mouthless and so a meatless people or kind of men about the head of Ganges, which liveth by the breath of their Nostrils, except when they take a far journey, they mend their Diet with the smell of flowers: and lest you may think I lean upon bare Authorities without the stay of reason, all the matter rests upon this reason I told you before, that our life lay in the hand (beside a little exercise) of two like meats, one for the Soul and Natural heat which is within us, and the finest and first moisture in our body, the others is without any meat, of the same Temper with our body as near as may be; to uphold the frame and building of
the same which I said to be a fine Aiery and Fiery flame. And we are now grown so out of order, and so much estranged from our Etherial first Moisture and the life of God, that we creep downward towards the Earth through diseases, before we can reach the Life of the Vehicle; within sixscore years we dye, and are hidden from the sensible approch of renewing life. CHAP. XI. Of Nature and her medicines experienced by Rosie Crucians, and of the occult virtue of Mysteries; of the healing and consuming medi∣cines and of their use; of the Gout, Leprosie, Dropsie and Falling Sickness, &c. NOW the Aire it self, especially when it is ever more as the wet Sunbeams declare, so sprinkled with some Fine for∣raign fatness, may seem sufficient food to nourish the finer part of our Frame, wherein the temper of mankind, and his life (touching that point) standeth, which is as much as any meat can do to life, (for it is not fed by common food, as I said above) though not enough for strength, because the grosser, sounder, and tougher parts wherein the strength lyeth, shall want food in this Dyet, and fail no doubt greatly, yet life shall last still, as long as Aire and first moisture holds, in my opinion: or if we think that so spare a Diet, we may mend it (as the mouthless people do) with smell of Flowers: or rather, as we know Nature is able to draw Aire and other food which she desireth through the skin into all places of the body; so if she had meat applyed to the stomach, she would no doubt satisfie herself that way most finely, without the heap of hurts let in at the broad and common gates, as we see by example for Drink, that all the while we sit in Water we shall never thirst▪ And for meat, I have heard Rosie Crucians say, by applying of wine in this sort they fasted without all hunger for two years together. And in like manner I have experienced this, and fasted two dayes when I first studied the nature of the Guardian Genii: But if that would not serve the turn, and we must needs receive in
meat at the common gate, yet we may let it pass no further then the gate, and make the stomach in the mouth, which is the use of some Rosie Crucians when they are Seraphically illuminated; and to provide enough for life and strength, and a great deal bet∣ter for our health, then we do, because the clearer part alone should be received, And moreover I say, for the clear dispatch of that our ordinary trouble and anoyance which your reverence will not suffer me to name, although I might among Physicians, but they know my meaning: But it shall not need to steal shifts and holds if you will believe the Rosie Crucians, that we may easily fast all our life (though it be three hundred years together) without all kind of meat, and so cut off all doubts and dangers of diseases thereof springing; and for my own part, I know some that have fasted and lived in the holy orders of the Fraternity without all food ten years space together. What need we say more? if you be both so hard of belief, and dull of sight, and reports of good Authors, nor my own experience will sink into you, nor yet can you see the light of reason shining before you, take here a few of ordinary matters in the life and use of men, and weigh one with another; is it not as common in use, and indeed needful, to spit, and avoid another nameless leaving? and to Drink but to sleep especially? If some of these, nay all may be spared, why not our meat also? let us see a little, and by example, because Reason is both too long and too open to cavil. To leave drink, which many have all their lives left; Elizabeth Drewe, a Devonshire Gentlewoman, is reported never to have spat, nor the whole Indian Nation. Sr. Iohn Heydon saith, he knew one that kept the nameless matter forty daies together. And although this answereth not the question, yet it sheweth the truth of the for∣mer Holy Story, for if in so foul and gross a thing as dyet is, he could so long want it, why not these men for ever, in so clear and fine adiet, almost empty and void of all leavings? For the gros∣ser sort, which make up this foul and shameful one we left be∣fore, as you heard, and the finer in the passage from the Stomach through the former Gates were drawn all away to the Liver, as the like is ever in us and voided otherwaies. To close up all, I was at Sea with one that slept not one wink for these three years last past, and Mr. Iohn Knotsford is a Witness to this truth, and Capt. Windsor.
And thus we see these strange things fall our in proof, but how I cannot stand to shew: First, nature suffers them, then use and cu∣stome another Nature brings them in, yet we may well beleeve the like in this matter of meat we have in hand; For as the Bear (according to the guise of many Beasts that lurk in Winter) fasteth fourty daies, so Eugenius Theodidactus, the reported Rosie-Crucian tells of a Scottish young man, David Zeamons, that waited on him, that by use brought himself to fast three daies together, which by use might have been three hundred as well, if he had ordered himself thereafter by slow and creeping custome, as Captain Copeland calls it, and by such means as I set down be∣fore. So we see, I say, great wordly wonders prove plain and easie truths in the sight of Wisdome: you have read of the won∣derful works of God in the Acourate Structure of mans Body, of his Soul, of his Senses, of Plants, of Minerals; and Rosie Crucian medicine shall be that which I will insist upon, and that by the means aforesaid (where are more than one, if this like them not, they may take another) it is possible for all men by kind and custome to keep their health for ever: Let us come to the next point, that is, aswell to be recovered if it were lost, and that all diseases may be cured. This is a point much harder then the first, even so beset and stopt with all kind of lets and incumbran∣ces, that a man can scarce tell which way to set his foot forwards. First appears Aesculapius, Hippocrates, and Plato, the chief among the Grecians, bearing in hand sundry diseases of both kinds (both come by descent, and gotten by purchase) hopeless and past reco∣very, and giving over the men that owe them, for troublesome to themselves and to the Commonwealth: Then you may see Galen, and his soft and fine Company with him, and that follow these are Gerard and Riverius, and Culpepper, and these with a long train of hedge-Doctours; and among these stands Freeman, with Caterers, and Cooks, laden after them with all kind of dain∣ty Druggs, stand forth and Cry, they have these many ages de∣voured heaps of Books, and took endless pains in searching out the Nature of single Medicines, and making mixtures of the same, and yet could hardly cure some Agues, and other less diseases; But for the four great diseases, viz. the Gout, Leprosie, Dropsie,
Falling Sickness, they could never heal them, and have therefore for Oracles set them down incurable. CHAP. XII. That the knowledge and vertue of Medicines are secretly hid from vulgar understanding: how they may be gotten: and of what lies couched in the Oil of Bodies: of the use, and how to fetch it out by Skill, the Haven of Medicine. VVHat is left to be done in this Matter? what shall we set against the weight of so many great mens Authori∣ties? Equally put them in the Ballance, as we have done hither∣to, and weigh them with truth and reason: But where shall we find it? say they; As it is every where, as Mr. Hobbs said, drowned in the deep, so in this matter it is scattered all about, and largely spread withall; for there be three things, and every one full of under-Branches, belonging to the Rosie Crucian Art and way of Healing; The first is knowledge of the Diseases, the second the re∣medies against them, and the third of the Appliance of the remedies, all which should be traversed in this Methodical mysterious Treatise: but it shall not need I hope, nay we must take heed how we enter into so long and large a race, in so short and narrow a compass of time appointed, especially being never run before by any man but our self, not one of the wise Egyptians, nor our Ancestours, the holy Company of Moses and Elias, whose steps we strive to follow, and their successours; for when they have once hit the mark they have shot at, and gotten the great and general Medicine Caput mortuum A. P. curing with ease all diseases, they think it straight enough, and an empty and needless Labour, as it is indeed, to trouble themselves and their Children with large Rules about innumerable Signs and Causes of infinite diseases, and about other small particulars in appliance. Neither would I have you set Sendivogius, Paracelse, and their heirs upon me, and say they have taken great and goodly pains in this field; you will then force me to speak my thoughts.
Though these men, (to let Philalethes, Vaughan, and Culpepper, Varlet, Freeman, and other Pretenders, with some Schollars goe, as too young and childish yet,) by great light of Wit wherewith they flowed, and by long proling both with eies, ears, and hands, in the mysteries of Egypt, saw and performed many of the Rosie Crucian deep secrets, yea and there got most of their worldly praise, although I think a number feigned, yet Paracelse his new Art and Rules of Healing are not good in my opinion; For first, against the example of the Rosie crucians, from whom he had recei∣ved all things, and then in despight and disgrace of Galen, for mis∣calling his Countrymen, as you have heard, but chiefly carryed away with a mad and raging desire of Fame and Honour, which Culpepper alwaies despised, yet the Starres favoured him, when I assisted to set up that new, famous and strange work of Physick, now well known and practised, which Paracelse when he took in hand, a man unfit to do it, to pull down and raze the old Work, and to set up our new experienced secret, which he could never do all his life. Then we see how it is performed, he sets down some false rules, some wast, idle, and some wanting, and all unconstant, dis∣ordered, and unlearned; when he doth well (as he doth sometime) he doth no more then was done before him, and brings in the same thing disguised with new, odd, cross, and unheard of names, such as may move wonder at the first, but when they be scanned, Laughter, as Mr. Moor saith of Eugenius Philalethes his like de∣vises in his Aula Lucis Adamica Magica & Euphrates, and others of his Welch Philosophie. And that I doe not slander them where there is no cause, I could prove, if this place would admit a Volume. Wherefore let us follow the true and right Rosie Cru∣cians, as easily you may know them by their actions, if ever you fortune to see them and be acquainted with them; and leave Paracelse, and the rest in this ill matter, and Light and Apish, as he makes it; and why should we spend all our care and thought about a small matter? you have a good Medicine and remedy a∣gainst diseases, when old wives in the Countrey, and some good Women, amongst other Dr. Culpeppers late wife, and Simple men, on our side (I mean Simple in respect of the Grecian sub∣tilties about nothing) when these people have healed most, nay,
even all diseases, and with which womanish Medicines indeed, the German Doctour (let us give him his due praise) hath quite slain the Grecian Physick, and here done much for mankind, by describing and dispatching our close and secret enemie, which under colour of friendship and fighting against our enemies hath this long time betrayed us and done us much mischief; which thing one of their best Captains of their State, Fernell by name, after he had been a while in Egypt, began to smell at last, and began to repent himself of all his former pains (which we know were great) bestowed in that kind of Healing, saying it to be but words, and the whole force and weight of this Art to lean upon the knowledge and vertues of Medicines, secretly hid and couch∣ed in the midst and oyl of bodies, to be fetched out and gotten by the skilful means of Alchymists; even so of that Art, which is so much condemned of his fellows before and since him, have fled and do daily flie from the daily toil and trouble of their fruitless and barren dead Sea: Now let us shift our Sailes, and flie further too, I hope of wind and tide and all; which we have. But let us mount up to the main-mast top of our Knowledge, and see if we can describe the Haven of Rosie Crucian Medicines, and see what marks it hath, and how it differs from other Creeks adjoining, lest at our journeys end we miss, with more shame and grief, and suffer shipwrack. A medicine is that which kills the face of that which hurts us; and this it doth many waies, and yet also to one end (which is is the end of all doing and working as I said before) for his food and sustenance.
CHAP. XIII. Medicines against Witchcraft, and to cure those that are afflicted thereby, although their bodies be possessed with evill spirits, that cause them to vomit up Needles, Thimbles, Pots, Glasses, Hair, and shreds of cloth, which by the Divil were conveyed into the bo∣dy. That Winds and Tempests are raised by Witches upon meer ceremonies of Medicines, and of poysons; with the examples also of other supernatural effects of unclean spirits, and of imaginati∣on. How to cure a Witch, and to take away her power. A Servant of God and Secretary of Nature, must be well advised of what he writes, especially in this age, and of this matter (viz.) of the Rosie Crucian Physick, lest he should, as I said before, fail in this design, and so it may be a shame that he should be reproved, by the pretenders to those wise truths he alone hath opened to publick view; then let us come again and sort our speeches. A Medicine heals us, and kills our enemie, either by dulling or consuming it; for when it meets with a contrary of even strength (as when oyl and poyson &c. joyn) then in strength they neither eat up nor destroy one another, but both are dulled and weakned, and make one heavy thing which nature casteth out for an unlike and unkindly dead thing, which they call an excrement, or (Lea∣ving;) but in case it be of more strength and power then our ene∣mie, then it quite destroyes, devours, and turns him into his own nature. And this consumer is either like the thing that hurts us, in which sort even as every herb of sundry qualities draws and feeds upon his own juice in a Garden; so one Poyson doth cure another, and all purging and drawing things do heal us, and all Rosie Crucians hid and Divine properties do work by plain reason; or else it is unlike and contrary to their custome; after which manner as dry sticks, and Tow, and vinegar quench wild fire, or other Fat Fires, before water, whose fatness feeds it, for the strong contrary quality quelling and eating up the weaker; so doth any cold and dry thing as Bolearminick, Terra Lemnia, &c. cure a Rotten poyson: and so are a great number of cures done; which
onely course, in a word, the Rosie Crucians use for Physick, and not indeed without good success; we heard even now of two hinderances of healing, which our common Physicians did take unawares, and Paracelse pretends to have found out before me, gave any hint to the World of our experienced inventions, of Gold dissolved and made potable, being incorporated with its proper Veyle, which we now use by the name of Aurum potabile; but Paracelse straieth much in the making of it, and knows it not no more than that tattered Doctor Freeman, so shamefully called a∣mongst Physicians: Whither in their poisons, on the other side, when they think all cures thereby performed. Now when the Consuming Medicines have done their duties, Nature expells them for poison and unlike strange things, accor∣ding to the Rosie Crucian Axiomata, as well as the Grecian Rules, because all their Medicines were not approved by the Fraternity, and were by their confession such: But if they had either thought of the dulling nourisher, which as I told you, takes the nature of the leaving or excrement, or had known the Rosie Crucian whol∣some Medicine, they would have made another reckoning; But let them go, and us see out in time towards the Haven of Health, If the Art of Healing be nothing but destroying hurtful things, And their stronger enemies (but equality will sometimes serve the turn) or likes together; and the world be full of both these kinds of Creatures, following the nature of their Parents of four beginnings, which are as we see, some like, and some con∣trary one to another. Then sure the Rosie Crucian Art of Healing is not (as some may say) impossible, truly it wanteth nothing, but a man well skilled in the Nature of things, A servant of God, and Secreta∣ry of Nature by name; for (I think) I need not put in a Physici∣an, to know what other part the Causes of the diseases, which must be known and matched, because as Sr. Christopher Heydon the Seraphically Illuminated Rosie Crucian, and learned Astrologer, well saith, He that knoweth the changes and chances of things in the great World, may soon find them in the Little. But our nought-Healing Bill-men, that daub Medicines upon every Wall and Post, and some Leaches, will step in, and say, diseases are in some so great, and in all so many, and mans wit is
so weak and shallow, and the Medicines so hid and drowned in the deep of Nature, that it is not possible to find them all; or if they were found, to apply them with such discretion as Nature might abide those poisoned Fraies and Battels within her. And again, admit all this untrue, yet there be some diseases sent from Witchcraft and Sorcery, and other means which have their cause, and so their Cure. I have read of som that have vomited uppieces of Cloth with Pins stuck in them, Nails, Needles, & such like stuff; and this is ingested into the Stomach, by the prestigious Sleights of Witches; Others I have seen vomit up Hair, Glass, Iron, and pieces of Wood with Pins stuck in it; anothers Corps was dissected, and ripping up the Ventricle, there they found the Cause of the dis∣ease, which was a round piece of Wood, four Knives, some even and sharp, others were indented like a Saw. Others do Miracles by casting Flint-stones behind their Backs towards the West, or striking a River with Broom, or flinging of Sand in the Air, the stirring of Urine in a hole in the ground, or boyling of Hogges Bristles in a pot; some by whispering some words in the Ear of an horse or wild Stagg, could direct him a journey according to their own desire. But what are these things available? to gather Clouds, and to cover the Air with darkness, and then to make the ground smoke with peals of Hail and Rain, and make the Air terrible with frequent Light∣ning and ratling Claps of Thunder: But this is from the power of the Divel (as some fancy) which he hath in his Kingdome of the Air. For the Remedy of these mischiefs, I have seen a man was present, when some have vomited up Needles, Thimbles, Shreds of Cloth, pieces of Pots, Glass, Hair; another would suffer him∣self for money to be run thorow with a sword when I was not there, but it appeared to me a Fable. I have seen a Rosie Crucian Physi∣cian cure these afflicted People. But if you will say, There is a touchstone whereby we may discerne the truth of Metals, but that there is nothing whereby we may discover the truth of Mi∣racles recorded every where in History. But I answer there is, and that is this: First, If what is recorded was avouched by such persons, who had no end nor interest in avouching such things. Secondly, if there were many eye-witnesses of the same matter.
Thirdly and lastly, If these things which are so strange and mi∣raculous leave any sensible effects behind them; Though I will not acknowledge that all those Stories are false that want these Conditions, yet I dare affirme that it is meer Humour and Sul∣lenness in a man to reject the Truth, of those that hear them: For it is to believe nothing but what he seeth himself, from whence it will follow, That he is to read nothing of History, for there is neither Pleasure nor any usefulnesse, if it deserve no Be∣lief. Another Remedy for these Supernatural diseases, is, Let one watch the party Suspected, when they go home to their house, and presently after, before any body goe into the house after him or her, let one pull a handful of the Thatch, or a Tyle that is o∣ver the Door, and if it be a Tyle, make a good Fire, and heat it red hot therein, setting a Trivet over it; then take the parties Water, if it be a Man, Woman, or Child, and poure it upon the red hot Tyle, upon one side first, and then on the other, and a∣gain put the Tyle into the Fire, and make it extremely hot, turn∣ing it ever and anon, and let no body come into the house in the mean time. If they be Cattle that are bewitched, take some of the Hair of every one of them, and mix the Hair in fair water, or wet it well, and then lay it under the Tyle, the Trevet standing over the Tyle, make a lusty fire, turne your Tyle oft upon the Hair, and stir up the Hair ever and anon; after you have done this by the space of a quarter of an hour; let the fire alone, and when the Ashes are cold, bury them in the ground towards that quar∣ter of Heaven where the suspected Witch lives; this Mr. Lilly saith he hath experienced. If the Witch live where there is no Tyle, but Thatch, then take a great handful thereof, and wet it in the parties Water, or else in common Water mixed with some Salt, then lay it in the Fire, so that it may molter and smother by degrees, and in a long time: setting a Trivet over it. Or else take two new Horse-shooes, heat them red hot, and nail one of them on the Threshold of the Door, but quench the other in the Urine of the party so bewitched, then set the Urine over the fire, and put the Horse-shooe in it, set∣ting a Tryvet over the Pipkin or Pan wherein the Urine is; make
the urine boil with a little salt put into it, and the Horse nailes, until its almost consumed, viz. the Urine; what is not boiled fully away pour into the fire: Keep your Hors-shoe and Nails in a clean Cloth or Paper, and do likewise three several times; the operati∣on will be far more effectual if you do these things at the very change or full Moon, or at the very hour of the first or second Quarter. If they be Cattel, you must mix the hair of their Tails with the Thatch, and moisten them being well bound together, and so let them be a long time in the fire consuming. You have heard the Cause of some of these diseases, and have heard the Cure by Sympathie also; but these are without the compass of Nature, and so let them pass with our fickle standing, which is daily and hourely so beset with destinies, that a man can warrant nothing. Truly destinies are so deep and bottomless, (to return straight Homer-like upon them, and therefore it were best indeed to let them goe, and the applying of the Medicines with them) The rather because the other, (I mean the former) is so slight a matter to a discreet Physician, such a one as is pointed out by their old and famous Leader Hippocrates, who both in this and all other duties of his Art made such speed, and so far passed all his fellowes (as none since, which is a good time, could ever overtake him) no nor yet come so neer as to keep the sight of him, whom they had in chase and followed. Then for those Supernatural causes, which I shall not stand here to search (for so they are called) if they flow from unclean and wicked Spirits (as some think) they are not the Stuff of the things that hurt us, though somtimes they dwell in and possess the body, but windy matters, much like unto those fierce and sud∣den changes of the Weather, proceeding from the Influences of the Planets and fixed Stars, and working the like effects in mens bodies, so that sith the nearest cause is Natural, let the rest be what they will, and the Cure be done by Natural means, as we see by experience amongst us: And therefore E. A. that pretends this, and puts the fault in the Faith of the wicked, which is a thing as far above Nature, yet holds its Cure with a Natural Medicine, which we call a Quintessence.
Although I am not willing, that sometimes this sickness is such as he bids us sometimes withstand it with another as strong a belief set against it, but for my part, I cannot reach it with my conceit (let deeper heads then mine or the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, Doctor Owen, think upon it) how these beliefs and imagi∣nations, and other parts and powers of the soul or mind of man, can so flye out of their own kingdome, and Reigne over a forraign body, when we know the Soul and minde is so fast bound in the bo∣dy indurance, and so like to be, untill it be the great pleasure of the Omnipotent and the Omnissent God, the chief good, who hath committed them, to let them loose at once, and set them full at Liberty; and this may be disputed with Grace and knowledge on my part; Let this man therefore buzze against my knowledge, which he would have to be more then Grace, I appeal to the Naturall faculties of any free judge, whether there be not as much Grace in me as there is honesty in him: All men censure as they like of Stories; so let them pass amongst old wives tales for me, we will severely follow our task. That if the effect do not cease which the object hath wrought upon the Brain, so soon as ever by turning aside of the Organs the object ceaseth to work (viz.) though the sence be past; As the stroke of a stone, a blast of wind, puts standing water into Motion, and it doth not presently give over moving as soon as the wind ceaseth, or the Stone setleth: so the Image or Conception remaineth, but more obscure, while we are awake, because some object or other continually plyeth and solli∣citeth our eyes and ears, keepeth the mind in a stronger Motion, whereby the weaker doth not easily appear. And this obscure conception is that we call Phantasie, or Imagination; Imagination being (to define it) conception remaining, and by little and little decaying from and after the act of sense, &c. If some of these dis∣eases spring, as Mr. Moore, Doctor Culpeper, and some others hold, and with good reason, from neither of both these two roots named, but from a foul and venomous breath, sent forth from a poysoned temper of the Witches body, through the windiness of hatefull eyes: For Thought fashioneth the blood and Spirits almost at his pleasure; then all the causes being ordinary, and agreeing to the course of Nature, they may be cured and put to flight by the same course and means; which opinion, if you please to bear
with my tarrying, it is worth the handling, taketh hold upon this reason, because (as Rosie Crucians do witness) some beasts of ranker venome, do witch and hurt after the same manner; as an old Toad by stedfast view, not onely prevails, but benums a Weasell, but kills a young child. And by the same means the Bever hunts the little fish, and takes his prey: But most fiercely and mischie∣ously of all creatures in the world, the two monsters in kind, the Cockatrice and Apoblepas: again, for that the eye of a menstruous woman (as all report) doth spot the glass which it beholdeth; and moreover Eugenius Theodidactus, in the wisemans Crown, telleth of many folk that through a poysoned prerogative, which a monstrous Mark of a double-sighted eye gave unto them, were able to bewitch to death all those upon whom that eye was angerly and surely set and fastned; but chiefly because we see them that use this wicked trade, to be by kind of a muddy and Earthlike com∣plexion and nature, brought by age, as they be most commonly long life, and gross diet, to the pitch of melancholy, that is, to a cold and most dry nature in the world. For certain proof whereof, bring one of them out of that beast∣like life, brought unto merry company, and fed full with dainty Diet, and within twenty days, as hath by a Rosie Crucian been tried a truth, the whole state and nature of her body will be so changed, as it shall not suffer her to bewitch and hurt again; as you may read in my Familiar Spirit or Guardian Genius.
CHAP. XIV. The Naturall effects of Medicine: the force and power of mineralls in diseases; with examples also that every disease-breeder hath the cure or remedy in it: examples that poyson prepared cures poy∣soned people: Rosie Crucian Arts: the virtue and power of the Planets and heavenly Stars poured through the influence of the moon upon the Lower Creatures: of Hot Stomachs: of the Etherial first moisture of of man: examples also of Rosie Crucian Natural and supernaturall cures: of the understanding of these experienced truths by the wit of man: of Paracelsus and Culpeper. LEt us come to the next and chiefest point; And there we must not say for shame, that these helps and remedies lye hid in nature, too far for the wit of man to find, unless we will accuse our own sloth and dulness: For nature hath brought them forth and laid them open aswel as the Poysons and hurtful things, or else she were very cross and ill-willing to him for whose sake it seems she doth all things. Nay further (as Mr. Hobs saith) her good will is such, as she hath not only laid them open, but given us wayes to come by them, and means of speech, hands and wit also, far above all o∣ther living creatures. And yet she hath not left us so, but lest by chance we might go wide and miss them, to shew her mother∣ly love and affection towards us, she hath guided (as Mr. Moor saith) many witless Beasts, even by common sense, unto their speedy helps and remdies in their diseases: That we by the plainness and shame of the example (as Mr. Gadbury wisely saith) might be taught and moved to seek out the mysterious truths of nature in Celestial bodies, as wel as beasts that seek and find us Medicines helpful in the like diseases, for our Terrestial Taberna∣cle. As to name a few not unworthy meaning; she maketh the beast Hippotamus in time of his fulness and fatness to go to a reed, and by rubbing a vain to let himself blood, and to stop it again by laying mud upon it; A sick dog to seek an Herb and purge him∣self; and the bear to do the same after his long fast in Winter; she leads the Panther, when he is poysoned, to her foul and nameless
leaving; and the Tortoyse, after he hath eat a Viper, to Summer Savery: And the Hedg-hog is so good a natural Astronomer, that he fortifies his hole against foul weather; the Hog will gather Moss and straw to cover himself a little before it rains; The dog knows the influence of Mars when he doth sleep by the fire, and will not go out a dores when he is in any evil position: and many such like examples hath nature laid before us for our instruction; by which at last wise Plato, Philo, Apollonius, Pythagoras, and pain∣ful men of Greece, as they themselves report, be they Elias or E∣lisha, from whom the order of the Rosie Cross came, (as some say) or else as others will have it, from Moses, or Ezekiel, or whoso∣ever, and by laying reason and further proof together, first made the Art and rules of Healing, to know whence diseases came, and how to recover them. And then seeking all about for remedies to serve each turne, by little and little they matched the most part of the lesser rank with single Medicines, and the greater ones they doubled and coupled many together, insomuch as at last, which was in Hippocrates time, they were able to heal all (saving four,) of the greatest and deepest diseases, the Gout, the Dropsie, the Leprosie, the Falling sickness; which are now healed by the Rosie Crucians onely. But this race is below the Seraphically illuminated Fraternity: now not a Physician that is lined with Plush in England, Spain, Germany, or France; but holds that Long-life, Health, Youth, not attainable, they there∣fore with one consent, amongst the other four, call them impos∣sible. But to come to the point; what wrong this was both to skill and nature, they do easily see and laugh at, which know that in this labour, they did not onely oversee and skip the Minerals, the stoutest helps in the whole store-house of Nature (although they could dig them out well enough to other and worser uses) but also, which is in all, did let the Rosie Crucian skill of preparing Medicines, whereby weak things are made almighty, quite es∣cape them. Wherefore to make up the Rosie Crucian Art of healing, and to make it able (as they say) to help and cure all diseases came in, or rather went before them, into mans body; The Egyptians in great savour too with nature both for their soil and bringing up,
so notably commended above all nations, (having for example, to move and teach them even the great weight of the world as Sr. Iohn Heydon saith) for wits to devise, and bodies to put in pra∣ctise. Whereby in short time they unfolded the knot why the Mine∣rals were of greatest force and power against diseases; and soon after, which was a divine light, and in-sight, they perceived the huge labour of seeking such a huge sort of singles and mixtures to be vain and empty, and pittiful among wisemen. Because first, there is nothing hurtful and a breeder of disease, but it hath the heal and remedy for the same about him: For the wings and feet of Cantharides, the Fruit of the Root Bezar, the Ashes of Scorpions, Toads, and Vipers; and divers other stron∣ger poysons, both by nature and skill drest and prepared, do cure and heal their own and all other Poysons; nay as all stronger likes do cure their likes throughout the whole world of diseases, even so when a man hath found out the thing that hurts him, he may by easie skill mingle and break the temper of the same further; that is, make it able to eat up and consume it self as ea∣sily, without any further doubt, toil and labour; But especially because there is no one thing in the world, take what you will, that hath not the vertues of the Planets arrested and fastened upon it, and also of the qualities thereof within it self, that is not as good as all, and may serve instead of all, and that is not able to cure all diseases; which thing weighed, and with discourse of wit and reason fully reached, they went to practise, and by the like sharpness of wit, they found out the kindly and ready way to dress and make fit these three kinds of Medicines aforesaid, which contain all the Art of healing, all the rest are but wast words and grievous toyl, to tire a world of wits about a bootless matter, as saith Des Cartes. But especially they rested in the last, which is enough alone, and yet not without great forecast, to chuse one of the best, and that the very best of all, for their ease in dressing. Though Dr. Culpeper of late was not content with this, but ran through the rest, aswell to spite his enemies, the Colledge of Physicians, as to make himself famous in Taverns and Alehouses, as Paracelse in his time did▪ whose steps he strove to follow against the rule of Rosie Crucian wisdom and vertue;
and the example of his ancestors. But hath every thing all the vertues and influences taken from the Planets and Stars by the Moon, to the earth; That is, all the curing and healing power of all the things in the world? very well you must remember that I proved above all the vertues and powers of heaven, poured down through the Influence of the Moon, upon these lower creatures, to be nothing else (as Captain George Wharton truly saith) but one self same life and Soul, and heaven∣ly heat in all things, And again, that all diseases flow from di∣stemper, and as it were discord of the Natural consent of the bo∣dy; then that thing which is endued with store of life, and with exact and perfect temperateness, seated upon both a subtile and strong body, (which the thing in the bottom is) able alone by subduing his weaker enemies, those distempered diseases, by strengthening his fellow life, Aurum Potabile, in our bodies. And lastly, by orderly binding together the frame that was slipt out of order, to do as much as all the powers and forces of all the Plants, Weights, and minerals in the world, that is, to put to flight all trouble of diseases, and restore the body to perfect health and quierness. But how is all this done? we talk of high things, and huddle up too many great matters together. It were good for us to work them out distinctly; when this Aurum Potabile we speak of, and strong tempered medicines, slip into the stomach, it stayes no long digestion, being already digested, nor look for any ordinary passages to be opened unto it, but as soon as it is raised out of sleep by his fellow, the natural heat, by and by he flyes our, and skowers about, as fast as the Dolphine after his prey, or as nature her self, whom Mr. Booker, as I take it (saith) to pierce bounds, and all to the purpose, that is to seek his like food, and sustenance, whereby to preserve his state and being, which is the purpose of all things in the world, as was said above. Now there is nothing so like and neer a perfect temperature in the world, as the Etherial first moisture in man; But what this is, you may read in my book entituled  Ventus mag∣nus. This is best and most in the heart, the root of life, then thither it hyeth and preyeth upon that part first, and that is the cause why
it presently restoreth a man half dead, and as it were, pulls him out of the throat of death; then it runs to the rest all about, in∣creasing by that means the natural heat, and first moisture of eve∣ry part of the body; when this is done, he turns upon the parts themselves, and by encountring with them in the same sort, according to his might, feeds upon them, and brings them a certain way towards his own nature, even so far as we will by our usage suffer; for if we take it with measure and discretion, it will bring our body to a middle mean and state, between his own exact temperature and the distemper of disea∣ses, even a better state then ever it had before; if we use it out of measure, it takes us up too high, and too near his own nature, and makes us unmeet for the deeds of the duties of an earthly life. But in the mean while in the midst of this work, we must know that by his exceeding heat and subtleness which is gotten by Ro∣sie Crucian skill, and which make up the strength above all things, it divides and scatters, like smoke before the wind, all distempe∣red and hurtful things, and if they cannot be reconciled and tur∣ned to goodness, nature throws them out as dead, and unfruitful leavings. But how do we talk, (as Mr William Tub the Astrological Fen∣cer saith) so much of exact and perfect temper, when by the verdict of all the Quest in these cases there is no such thing found in nature, but in heaven onely? neither heard you me say that it floated aloft, but was sunk to the bottom of all nature; notwithstanding by a true and Holy Rosie Crucian to be sounded and weighed up. For as heaven was once a gross and distempered lump (as I told you in my book of the nature and dignity of An∣gels) by the divine art of God that ordered all things (as you have read in the Introductory part of this book,) refined and sun∣dred away round to the place and nature where it now standeth; even so one of our gross bodies here below, being a piece of the same lump also, and all one with that which Heaven once was, may by the like art and cunning be refined and parted from all his distempered dross and foul drossiness, and brought into a Hea∣venly nature of the best and goodliest thing in Heaven: And yet you must not take me as though I would have  wit of man, which is bt a spark of the divine g
in my book called Ventus Ingens) to be able to reach the excellen∣cy of his work, and to make so great perfection; if he do but shadow it, and make a Counterfeit, that is, if he reach not so far as to make all things, but to mend a few by this his Hea∣ven, all is well, it is as much as I can look for at the hand of any man that is not a Rosie Crucian. Now is the time to rest a little, and pray for the good use and practice of those that shall read our writing. CHAP. XV. Of the Rosie Crucian Sun, or Spiritual Oyl. Of the Divine Works of God not yet observed. How we make Aether. Examples of Me∣dicines Rosie Crucian and Grecian. Of Poison. Of the Superna∣tural Miracles of the Rosie Crucians, with obedience to Reason. Another Medicine of Supernatural effect. Of the power and se∣cret skill of Nature. How to dissolve Minerals: And how to pre∣pare them for Mens Bodies. EUgenius Theodidactus hath shewed you this Heaven, Nay this Sun of ours, which is nought else, as I told you in one of my books of Astrologie, but an Oyl full of heavenly Spirits, and yet in Quality of his body just, even and natural, fine and piercing, close and lasting, able as well to rule this little World, as Mr. Thomas Heydon saith, the great Sun is able to governe the great World. But what is he, saies Mr. Iohn Cleeveland, that can see this Di∣vine Art and Way, whereby God made his great and mighty work, viz:  as I shewed in my Book, intituled, Moses speech to God, upon the second chapter of Genesis? or if he saw it, learne and match it by imitation? I answer, None but Rosie Crucians, to whom I am a friend, and they God hath enlightned and unseal∣ed their eyes, they have found the way lying open in all places, and in all Natural changes, they see them pass and travel, I say still, the course that Heydon calls soft and witty, that is, kindly sepa∣ration: and if he be not swift and rash as many, such as Thomas
Vaughan and Street, but will have sober patience, his own skill and labour will be but little if he please; for Nature her self very kindly will in her due time performe all, and even all that hea∣venly workmanship be easily performed; and yet I mean not so but that Art must accompany and attend upon Nature (though with no great pains and skill) both forward and backward in this Journey (Doctour French knows my meaning, so doth Doctour Owen, if his angry Censure will suffer his Natural judgement) until he come to his wished rest, and to the top of all perfe∣ction. If you perceive not, consider the way whereby we made our Ether in our book abovenamed, and matched our own first moi∣sture, a thing Etherial, I say, and almost Temperate; mark what I say, there is a further end in the matter, hold on the same means whereby you came so far through The wise mans Crown, and are gone so far in the Way to bliss, which is that I spake of, and you may reach it. Then you see the way to cure all diseases by the third way of Egyptian healing, which they doe, and we may well call it the E∣gyptians Heaven, and yet it is a way far beneath the Rosie Crucian Art of Healing, as we shall shew hereafter. But if they will not yeeld yet to reason, but mutter stil Tho∣mas Street-like, that these Heavenly Medicines of ours are very high for the reach of mens silly wits, here strowed below upon the ground for other lesser and baser uses, and that no man since the first man, or if I will say Moses, was the first, that first found out these inventions as they call them, after Adam; and that none but the successors of Moses have been ever yet known to have found and wrought the same; I will not stand to beat reason into such giddy-braindmen, but go to the other two waies of healing, which the Egyptians found out and used, and called the first Mineral Me∣dicines, and these Moses taught the children of Israel in the val∣ley of mount Sinai, when he took the Golden Calf which he had made, and calcined it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and in∣corporated it with a Solar Veagle, and made the children of Israel drink Aurum potabile. And the next mysteries and secrets, as may appear by Riverius his speaking of Rosie Crucian Secrets, we fitly may call this second,
kind, because that is too large a Name (if it be lawful for us as well as for all other Learned men, where a fit word wants to make a new) we may do well I say to call it a Cure it self, because it is by that way of healing, whereby every self same thing further broken may cure it self; and this inward and hidden thing as they say, the outward and apparent by the course of kind, whereby the stronger like eates up in triall and consumes the weaker. If this leave be once granted, we will borrow a little more for the other two likewise, because their names, are not pertinent to our purpose, and call that Heaven a Cure-all, for so it doth, and the next a Cure-the Great, because the Order of the Rosie Crucians is alwayes to match the greater and more stubborn sort of diseases with the Stout and mighty minerals, and the rest with those hidden cure-themselves, or at least in the lower rank of lighter diseases, with their likes, onely raw, as the Grecians use them, without any curious dressing. Let us draw nearer a conclusion of the matter; because Grecians themselves are able, and our English Physicians that learn of them, to cure the lighter sort of diseases, and to heal all but the four aforesaid, we will leave the rest for them, and so let this second kind of healing go called our hidden cure themselves, and bend all our batteries against these four which they call incurable, and see how by force of our Mineral Medicines, they may be cured: we see the Poysoned spirits and breaths of venomous things, with what force they work upon our bodies, things in Nature set against them, and how they consume them; If you do not see by imagination, reason with your selves, if not remember those above named, that killed with their sight; Hear one or two more that work the same by touch as violently. The Hare-fish, a most cold and dry creature (to omit that she maketh a mans head ake by sight) if you touch her aloof onely with a staffe, that her veno∣mous breath may go straight and round unto you, you die pre∣sently. The root Baazam in Palestine, as Pythagoras writes, kills the man that handleth it, and therefore they used to make a dog pull it up (as Ben. Iohnson saith) who thereby died imediately. To come into the body; that costly poyson Mr. Linacre talks of, that is in Nubia, and one grain kills a man out of hand yet stay but a quarter of an hours working, and that one grain divided will
overcome ten men; I hope you doubt not but these mighty poysons if they were like in Nature to the four great diseases, and by little and little to be born by Nature, and set upon them, would be able easily, by their great strength to devour and consume them; or else sure such heaps of poyson as the Physicians give us would not dwell so long within us, but would put out life in a moment. Now what are these poysoned Vapours, but most cold and dry bo∣dies, wrought and broken up by naturall mingling, unto great fineness and subtileness, by this peircing swiftly all about, and by these contrary qualities overcoming? Then let us take the stout∣est Minerals, such as are called Middle Minerals by Rosie Crucians, or hard juices by Mr. Berkenhead (to leave the Metals for a better purpose) be they poysons, as G. Agricola saith, but what they be I care not, and after we have by meer working, cleansed them and stripped them of their cloggs and hinderances, broken and raised them to a fine substance, then match them with their likes, the hurtfull things in our bodies, shall they not let all the rest alone, and straightway cleave to their fellows, as well as a purging medi∣cines, and so devour and draw them out by little and little? If there be no likes, I grant they will as well as that, fall upon their enemies, or good juices, and feed upon them. Then what do you doubt is not a Mineral body far better? And therefore if it be raised to as great a fineness, much stronger in working then the gentle and loose temper of a wight or plant: wherefore these our Mineral Medicines, and some other fore∣mentioned Medicines, and cure the great, as we call them, shall in any reason, work more violently upon their likes, then the natu∣ral poysons of Wights and Plants do upon their contraries, both be∣cause the like doth more easily yield then the contrary, and for that the lighter here is the stronger. But if you cannot see these things by the light of mind, open your eyes, and cast them a little into the School of Alchimy, into the lesser and lower school, I mean of Germans, and you shall see the Schollars, especially the masters, by stripping the Minerals, and lifting up their properties, but a few degrees, to work wonders; as to name three or four, by quenching the Loadstone in the oyl of Iron, his proper food, they make him ten times stronger, able to pull a nail out of a post, &c. And by this natural pattern they make
Artificial drawers, not for Iron onely, but for all other things, yea and some so mighty, as they will lift up an Ox from the ground, and rent the arm of a Tree from the body, as Mr. Comer doth witness; who reporteth again that he saw a flesh-drawer, that pulled up 100 weight of flesh, and a mans eye out of his head, and his Lights up into his Throat and choaked him. They make binders also to glew two pieces of Iron together, as fast as the Smith can joyn them To be short they make eaters also, that will consume Iron stones or any hard thing to nought in a mo∣ment; they dissolve Gold into an oyle; they Fix Mercury with the smoke of Brimstone, and make many rare devises of it; And all these wonders and many more they do by certain reason: I could tell you, if I could stand about it. In the mean time con∣sider, if these or any other such like Minerals were raised higher, and led to the top of their fineness and subtleness, and matched with their like companions, or with their contraries, if you will, those great diseases in our bodies, what stirrs they would make a∣mong them, how easily they would hew them, pierce, divide, waste, and consume them? But you mus alwayes have a special regard, that the Medicines be not liker our natures, then the na∣ture of the thing that hurts us; for then they would first fall up∣on us, and let the diseases alone, which heed is easily taken in minerals, things very far off our nature, saith Des Cartes. And with these experience the wonderful vertue of the oyl and water of Tobacco wise men I have known do miracles with it. What is to be said more in these matters? I think nothing, un∣less through the countenance of an idle opinion that reigns a∣mong them, they dare flye to the last, and of all other the most slender shelter, and deny our ability to break, tame and handle as we list, such stout and stubborn bodies: (what) because you know not how to do it, will you fashion all men by your mould? wise men would first look into the power and strength of skill and nature, and see what they can do and measure it thereby, and not by their own weakness; there shall you understand, that there is nothing in nature so strong and stubborn, but it hath its match at least, if not his overmatch in Nature, such is the nature of mans body, of his Soul of signatures of Plants, of mettals, and minerals, and other things also.
But admit somewhat weaker as Herbs and Plants, &c. yet this, if he get the help of a wisemans Art unto him, shall quickly wax great and mend in strength and be able easily to overcome, that other; mark how the dregs of Vinegar, a thing sprung out from a weak beginning, and it self as weak as water, is able if it be but once distilled, to make stouter things then minerals even mettals themselves, all but silver and gold, to yield and melt down to his own waterish nature, nay which is more then Mild-dew of Hea∣ven, as Mr. Cooks the Vicar calls it, wrought first by the Bee that cunning beast, and then, twice or thrice by the distiller, distilled will do the same, you may judge with your self, what not onely these, but other fiercer and sharper things, as Salts, &c. more like to do upon Minerals; and by the way consider, if such mild things as wine and honey, so meanly prepared, are able to sub∣due in that sort the most stiffe and tough things in the world, so minerals cheaper then Aurum Potabile, in their highest degree of dignity would cure the stoutest disease (being prepared fitly) that can grow in our bodies. Now let us sit and take our rest a little and then we will conclude our Rosie Crucian Medicines.
CHAP. XVI. How the Rosie Crucians make a Chirurgeons instrument; that it shall pierce through any part of the whole body, without sense or feeling, and sound the depth of a wound. The difference of Common Physi∣cians Raw, Blunt, and herby medicines, and Rosie Crucians: What a Physician ought to be, what they ought to learn, and what they ought to practise, and then I shall love them of the order of the Rosie Cross. BUt I wear away time in vain, to speak so much about tis matter; and yet sith all are not of like Capacity, I will adde one yet familiar example; when a Surgeon goeth about to search a wound that is deep, if he thrust at it with a Butchers prick he would move Laughter; let him take a Thorwe, and it wil pierce somewhat prettily; but to do it throughly, and at his pleasure he will use, (though to the great grief of his Patient) a fine and long instrument of Mettal. But a right Surgeon the common ones are but Butchers, such a one as is a Physician, and Astrologer, nay a Rosie Crucian also, would touch his Instrument, with a Load∣stone, that is commonly found, to make it pierce throughout the body without all sense or feeling; Even so good Physicians such an one, as the Lord Marques of Worcester had, whom he taught many fine inventions: he told me of a Golden ball that this Lord made, that let him throw it into a River or Pool, it would arise a∣again from the bottom at what hour he pleased. This noble Mar∣ques shewed me a key of the lock, that would tell him who touch∣ed it. Nay if it fortuned to be pickt he could know who did it, and what was taken away (before their faces) and many rare things I have seen this princely Philosopher do, which his excellency was pleased to shew me; such as these are hard to be found in this Go∣vernment, where none of these can live without great envie. If one of these Rosie Crucians be to encounter with our greatest ene∣mies, these four we speak of, he would not I hope, if he were a true Rosie Crucian be so mad as to thrust at them with the Raw and
blunt Herby Medicines such as Dr. Scarborough, prescribe, no nor although they be sharpened by Iacob Heydon, by plain di∣stillations: neither would he, I think for pitty, sting the poor pa∣tieni with Eugenius Philalethes Martyrdome of rude and rank Minerals, and unless they were made into a fine clean natural and temperate quality, which would work mightily, and destroy either of these four great diseases, Leprosie, Gout, Dropsie, and Falling sickness: but feed, Comfort, or at least not offend, and hurt his patient; they labour in vain that practise otherwise. These are the medecines which I onely use, and which a good and wise Physician ought onely to seek and follow, and if he cannot find it, let him use the cure themselves. But such a thing as this; I say, brought to this equality, and fineness of frame and temper, (were it at the first, wight, plant or mineral) was it which our father and founder Moses, (the chief of the Rosie Cross) said is like to Hea∣ven, and the strength of all strengths piercing and subduing all things. This was it that warranted his Sons the rosie Crucians to avow so stoutly, that Art was long and Life short, and all diseases cura∣ble, when Hippocrates the Father of Common Physicians, was dri∣ven by the infirmity and endless matter of his weak body, and envious mind tinctured with Covetousness, and fickle Medicines, to cry to Rosie Crucians, but they would not hear such hard-heart∣ed Fellows, nor give him long Life, he said therefore that Art was long, and Life was short. And whereas he and his off-spring were fain to leave many diseased helpless, to the great shame of Art and Plague of mankind, is it any marvel when as they prick at them (as I said) with a Butchers-prick? Nay, see what they do by their practice, they be so far from all help and comfort to the Patient in greatest danger, that they increase his wiser eys many waies, except the great easer of all pain, and their common Me∣dicine Death, be quickly administred: First, they make the Pati∣ent suffer the punishment due to their own slothful Idleness, bur∣dening his stomach with that labour of loosnening and sundering the Fine from the Gross, which they should before have taken in∣to their Glasses: and then by doing these often, they clean tire his feeble Nature (as it would tire a horse) when as by stripping the foul and gross stuff, that dulls the working, and reteining the
Vertue in a narrow strong body, they might doe as much at one time as they doe now in twenty, and because their Medicines applyed are of smaller power and weaker than the things that hurt us, they feed nourish and strengthen the disease and sickness, but for all this if some of this company and side of Leeches have been and are yet sometimes able to heal all diseases in our body (though with much ado, as you have heard) save the four named remediless, yea and those aswell in their spring as before their ripeness, as they themselves report. Is there any Proportion in Geometry? Let the College of Physicians lay measures why the Rosie Crucian mighty Medicines which I call Cure-the-greats, pas∣sing these in power, as much as the ripeness of a disease is above the Spring, shall not overmatch the ripe as well as the green Dis∣eases: Wherefore there be no doubts left, but this plainly true, That albeit the Grecians is weak and halting in this kind of heal∣ing, yet is the Egyptian, or (as now they terme it) the Paracel∣sians and Mineral skill sufficient to cure all diseases: Then I have paid the whole summe of my promise, touching the second means and helps to Bliss and Happiness, which is Life and Health. Before I close, I think it very meet, while the time and place very fitly serveth, to do a good deed, and this shall be my intent to admonish and exhort the Grecian Leaches, and their Scholars the English, Spanish, and French Physicians, whom if they follow Hippocrates, Plato, Pythagoras, and his fellows, I love for their Learning, and pitty for their misleading others (although it be grievous, I know to old Scholars, wone in a kind of Learning, to unlearne all as it were and begin again, for their own Credit and Virtue, yea and profit sake also, if they esteem that best, to leave those Gilded Pills and Sugred Baits, and all other crafty snares, wherewith the World hath been so long caught and so long tormented, and to seek this onely heavenly Society; as (to you that are learned) easily may temper your selves, and be acquainted with the ready, true, plain and certain way of Heal∣ing diseases. I think in former time they were not greatly to be blamed and accused but of dulness and weakness of understan∣ding, in not applying and seeing this perfection, and supplying of all their wants; but since they have been so often warned not
with words only, but with examples of Learned men, Matheo∣lus Fernelius, Severinus Danus, Philo Iudaeus, Diodorus Siculus, and other such like which have and doe revolt, and flie away from them daily, yea and by the certain deeds of Paracelse, it were im∣qity to sit still: Well, few words will serve to wise and vertuous Physicians, such as are of themselves forward. But there is another, and I am afraid, the greater sort, less ho∣nest, more Idle and Covetous, full of windy Pride and Words, but empty of all good learning, and they are no friends to Rosie Crucians, nor they to them, and these no gentle warning of any, no though a Rosie Crucian himself should come and bring Truth her self along with him in person, would prevail: who care not it seems if half mankind should perish for want of help and succour, rather then lose their gains; And which not onely speak foully but write foolishly, against this overflourishing vertue, but also like the giddy people of my time, where they catch the State, ba∣nish the men that hold and possess it; whereas if it were a good Commonwealth (quoth Aristotle) the matter would be so far from Banishment or Imprisonment, as they would esteem such a man as well as the Laws (for he is himself a Law) exempt from all obedience, and judge him worthy to be followed and obeyed as a perpetual King. This untowardness and crookedness in men causod all our Al∣healing Ancestors the Rosie Crucians from time to time, never to abide their Sentence, but to the great hurt and loss of mankind go into willing Banishment, you have established a kind of Govern∣ment among you (to pursue the same, like a little —) wherein you rule alone over the weak and sorry subjects of mens Bodies, then their health and safety you ought to seek onely, besides e∣nough to maintain a contented estate also, which Plato allowes his Governours, and not profit only (that were Tyranny) both for humanity and Religion sake, for to omit Religion, which they do lightly omit, if a Physitian begin once to make a prey of men, he is not onely no man, but a most Fierce and cruell Beast, not fit to be compared and matched and matched any where, if you seek all over the world as with the mishapen monster of India, which Aristotle describes, and calls Martichora, which being by nature or custome, I know not whe∣ther,
very greedy upon mans flesh, is with manifold and won∣derful helpes furnished, and armed unto it. First with a face like a Man, a voice like a Trumpet, two fit things to allure and call him in) and then if he flye, with the swiftness of an Hart to overtake him, he darts like a Porcupine, to wound him afar of; and with the tail of a Scorpion, as it were a poysoned shaft, near hand to sting him: furthermore, lest all this might not serve, by occasion of Armour, he hath feet like a Lion, fiercely and cruelly to tear him, and three rowes of teeth, on each Chap for the in devouring. Apply you and the Apothecarries, the rest your selves, in secret for my part, as I am not a Rosie Crucian, so I am as well as they, sorry to see evil done. And I am loath to speak evil of it, and sure were not the great grief and envy I do bear; and alwayes did, to see desert trodden down by such unworthiness, and some little hopes I have to hear of the amendment, and so of the return of the truth, and good men out of banishment and im∣prisonment, you should have found me in Westminster-Hall: as I have been an Atturny in Terme time, and mean to continue my practise there so long as I live, except in the Vacation, which I intend to spend in Chimical and Rosie Crucian Medicines for the good of honest plain meaning men and my self Eugenius Theodidactus. But some may ask what I mean by R. C. the Ceremonie is an Ebony Cross, flourished and deckt with Roses of Gold, the Cross typisies Christs sufferings upon the Cross for our sins, the Roses of Gold shew the Glory and Beauty of his Resurrection from death to life. And this is carried to Mesque, Cascle, Apamia, Chaulatean Virissa Caunuch, Mount Calvery, Haran and Mount Sinai, where they meet when they please and make Resolution of all their Actions, and then disperse themselves abroad, taking their plea∣sure alwayes in one of these places, where they resolve also all questions of whatsoever hath been done, is done, or shall be done in the world, from the beginning to the end thereof. And these are the men are called Rosie Crucians. FINIS.
