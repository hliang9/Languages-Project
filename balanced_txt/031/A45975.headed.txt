AN ACT FOR THE Better Execution Of His MAjESTIES Gracious Declarati∣on for the Settlement of his Kingdom of Ireland, and satisfaction of the several Interests of Adventurers, Souldiers, and other his Subjects there. WHEREAS an unnatural Insurrection did break forth against your Majesties Roy∣al Father of ever blessed Me∣mory, his Crown and Digni∣ty, in this Your Majesties Kingdome of Ireland, upon the 23. of October in the year of our Lord God 1641. and manifest it self by the murther and destructions of many thousands of your said Majesties good and loy∣al Subjects; which after∣wards universally spreading and diffusing it self over the whole Kingdome, settled into, and became a formed, and almost National Rebellion of the Irish Papists
against Your Royal Father of blessed Memory, his Crown and Dignity, to the destruction of the English and Prote∣stants inhabiting in Ireland, the which Irish Papists being represented in a General assembly chosen by themselves, and acting by a Council called by them, The Supream Council of the Confederate Roman Catholicks of Ireland, did first assume, usurp and exercise the power of Life and Death, make Peace and War, levy and coyn Money, and many other Acts of Soveraign Authority, treat∣ing with forreign Princes and Potentates for their Govern∣ment and Protection, and afterwards acted under a forreign Authority, by all the said ways disowning and rejecting your Royal Father, and your Majesties undoubted Right to this Kingdom, even whilest they treacherously used his and your Majesties Names in the outward forms of their Proceed∣ings, withall impiously seeming by words and shows to swear even unto that which by the whole series of their deeds they denied; and moreover presuming to pretend his late Ma∣jesties most Sacred Authority, even for their worst actions, all which they did (amongst other their evil designs) to frighten his good Protestant Subjects from their loyalty, to blast his Majesties Honor, and to widen the breach between his said Majesty and his seduced Subjects in England: The which ends by their said wicked stratagems they did too succes∣fully and mischievously effect: And whereas Almighty God hath given your Majesty, by and through your said English and Protestant Subjects absolute Victory and Conquest over the said Irish Popish Rebels and enemies, so as they, their Lives, Liberties and Estates are now wholly at your Maje∣sties disposition by the Laws of this Kingdom. And where∣as several of your Majesties Subjects, by whom, as instru∣ments, the said Rebels were totally subdued, did in the time of your Majesties absence beyond the Seas, for supply of the then pressing necessities, and to prevent the further desolation of this your Majesties Kingdom, enquire into the Authors, Contrivers and Abettors of the said Rebellion and War, and after much deliberation among themselves, and advice from others had thereupon, did dispossess such of the said Popish Irish Rebels of their Lands, Tenements and Heredita∣ments, as they found guilty of, and to have been engaged in the said Rebellion or War aforementioned, and did withall distribute and set out the said Lands to be possessed by sundry persons, their Agents and Tenants, who by advancing of their Moneys and Goods, or by hazarding of their Lives, had contributed unto the said Conquest, or who had been otherwise useful, as having served or suffered in the suppression of the
said Rebellion and War; and whereas several of your Ma∣jesties Protestant Subjects as soon as with much difficulty and hazard they had gotten the power of this Kingdom into their hands, did according to their bounden duty, with all hu∣mility and chearfulness invite your Majesty into this your Kingdom, with a faithful engagement to serve your Maje∣sty with their Lives and Estates; and afterwards when your Sacred Majesty their Soveraign Lord and King by your Gracious Letters from Breda, bearing date the 4/14 day of A∣pril, in the Twelfth Year of your Majesties Reign, intimated your Royal Intentions of returning to the exercise of your Regal Authority, they with others of your Majesties Prote∣stant Subjects did readily and dutifully yield up themselves and the said subdued people, with this your Kingdom of Ire∣land unto your Majesties absolute obedience and disposition, who thereupon after many Moneths Consideration, and the publick hearing of all parties concerned in, and pretending to Lands and Estates in this your Majesties Kingdom, as also after the receiving and weighing of expedient upon ex∣pedient in order to an universal accommodation and final settlement, did at length in your Princely Wisdom, Grace and Iustice set forth a Declaration, bearing date the 30. day of November, in the Twelfth year of your Majesties Reign, with several Explanations and Instructions relating there∣unto, expressing your Royal pleasure concerning the People and Territories of this your Majesties said Kingdom, De∣claring it likewise to be your pleasure, That all the parti∣culars in the said Declaration mentioned, should be effectu∣ally recommended unto your Majesties chief Governor or Go∣vernors, Privy Council and Parliament in this Kingdom for the establishing the same by Law. Now We the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, having well weighed and considered the nature of the Rebellion and War above mentioned, together with the Causes thereof, and Motives thereunto, and with what Industry and Malice the Regal Authority, the Brittish Interest, and Protestant Reli∣gion, were pursued and endeavoured to be eradicated, and be∣ing withal very sensible of the vast expense of Blood and Treasure, and of the unspeakable sufferings which the Brittish and Protestants, as well several times heretofore as of late, have undergone, to reduce this your Majesties Kingdom to a perfect obedience unto the Crown of England, do most thank∣fully acknowledge, accept and admire your Sacred Majesties Wisdom, Grace and Iustice towards all Interests in that your Majesties said Gracious Declaration and Instructions
expressed: And forasmuch as the Rapines, Depredations and Massacres committed by the said Irish and Popish Re∣bels & Enemies, are not only well known to this present Par∣liament, but are notorious to the whole World; notwith∣standing the many means and artifices which for many years together, have been used to murther such witnesses, suppress such evidences, and also to vitiate and imbezle such Records and Testimonies, as might prove the same against particular persons; and lastly, for that the said Rebels since their throw∣ing off your Royal Fathers and your Majesties Government, are become subdued and conquered enemies, and have justly forfeited all their Rights, Titles and Estates in this King∣dom: It is therefore Enacted, and be it Enacted by your most Excellent Majesty, with the consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority thereof, That all Honors, Manors, Castles, Houses, Places, Lands, Tenements and Here∣ditaments, Right, Title, Service, Chiefry, Vse, Trust, Condi∣tion, Fee, Rent-Charge, Chattels real, Mortgage, Right of Redemption of any Mortgages, Recognizance, Iudgements, Forfeitures, Extent, Right of Action, Right of Entry, Sta∣tute, or any other Estate of what nature or kind soever, in all and every the Counties, Baronies, Cities, Towns Corporate and walled Towns in this Kingdom, which at any time from and after the said 23. day of October in the year of our Lord 1641. were seized or sequestred into the hands, or to the use of his late Majesty King Charles the First, or of your most Gra∣cious Majesty that now is, or otherwise disposed of, distribu∣ted, set out, or set apart by reason of, or upon account of the said Rebellion or War, or which were allotted, assigned, gi∣ven, granted, ordered, distributed, disposed, demised, set out or set apart, to or for any person or persons use or uses, for Adven∣tures, Arrears, Reprizals or otherwise, or whereof his late Majesty, or your Majesty that now is, or any Adventurer, Souldier, reprizal person, or others respectively had and re∣ceived the Rent, Issue or Profits, by reason or upon account of the said Rebellion or War, or whereof the Adventurers, Officers, or Souldiers now or formerly of the English Army in this Kingdom, or transplanted or transplantable persons, or any of them, or their or any of their Heir, Heirs or Assignes, or any other person or persons whatsoever upon account of the said Rebellion or War, were in seizin, possession or occu∣pation by themselves, their Tenants, Agents or Assigns, on the Seventh day of May, 1659: or which were assigned, gi∣ven, granted, laid out, set apart, or reserved for or towards the satisfaction of any the said Adventurers, Souldiers or o∣ther
persons, for or in consideration of any money or provisions advanced, lent or furnished, or for Arrears of pay, or in com∣pensation of any Service or reputed Services, or other ac∣count whatsoever, or reserved or mentioned to be reserved, for or in order to a Reprisal or Reprisals for such Incumbran∣ces as then were, now are, or shall be adjudged due to any per∣son or persons out of the said Lands, Tenements or Heredi∣taments, or for any other use, intent or purpose whatsoever, or whereof any Custodiam, Lease for year or years, or other Disposition or Grant whatsoever hath been made, or unto which your Royal Father or your Majesty that now is, are any ways entituled by reason of, or upon account of the said Rebellion or War, or which are wrongfully detained or con∣cealed by any person or persons whatsoever, as also all Chan∣teries, and all Manors, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Tythes, Pensions, Portions, and other Hereditaments or things what∣soever, belonging to them or any of them, which were in the seizin, possession or occupation, and out of which any Rent, Duty, Tenure, or other Service was reserved of any person or persons, who by the Qualifications in this Act shall not be adjudged innocent persons; as also all Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments belonging to any Ecclesiastical person or persons, in his or their politick capacity, and that have for∣merly by them or any of them been let in Fee-farm, the right whereof, or Title thereunto, or Interest therein was in any person or persons, his or their Heirs or Assigns, who by the Qualifications in this Act expressed, shall not be adjudged in∣nocent persons; as also all Leases that have been made by any Ecclesiastical persons, of any Lands, Tenements or He∣reditaments belonging unto them in their politick capacity, to any person or persons, their Executors, Administra∣tors or Assigns, who by the Qualifications in this Act expres∣sed, shall not be adjudged innocent persons; as also all Im∣propriations or appropriate Tythes belonging to any person or persons, his or their Heirs, Executors, Administrators or Assigns, who by the Qualifications in this present Act expres∣sed, shall not be adjudged innocent, are, and shall be, and are hereby declared, deemed and adjudged as from the said 23. day of October, 1641. forfeited and to have been forfeited to your Majesty, your Heirs and Successors; and they hereby are from the said 23. day of October 1641. vested and settled in the real and actual possession and seizin of your Majesty, your Heirs and Successors, without any Office or Inquisition there∣of found, or hereafter to be found, notwithstanding that the persons who were the former Proprietors or reputed Proprie∣tors of the said Estates, or any of them, are not hereby, or
have not been heretofore attainted for, and by reason of the said most hainous and unnatural Rebellion and War. Provided, That this Act shall not extend to the avoiding of any Contract, Conveyance, Assurance or disposition of, for or concerning any of the said forfeited Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments made since the 23. day of October, 1641. by any Protestant Adventurer or Souldier, or other person of, or from such persons whose Estates if they had not so, as aforesaid, disposed them, would have been confirmed unto them by the Rules in this Act herein after limited or appointed, nor to the avoiding of any Contract for Lands in Connaught or Clare, set out by virtue of Decrees made by Protestants, or others that purchased any Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments from persons transplanted into the Province of Connaught or County of Clare, or their Assignes, nor to intitle your Ma∣jesty to the mean Profits of any of the said forfetied Castles, Manors, Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments since the 23. of Oct. 1641. allotted, assigned, enjoyed or set out to any Adventurer for adventures, or to Souldiers for arrears, to persons trans∣planted into the Province of Connaught or County of Clare, or their Assignes, or let by the late Vsurpers for yearly Rents, or granted by the late usurped powers, & confirmed by your Ma∣jesties said Declaration of the 30. of November 1660. and by this present Act, other than such of the Rents reserved on the premisses, as were not paid to the late Vsurpers, or to your Majesty, since your Majesties happy restauration, but are yet in arrear and unpaid, and other than forfeited Lands, Tene∣ments or Hereditaments concealed. Provided also, That this Act or any thing therein con∣tained, shall not be deemed, construed or taken to forfeit, or vest in your Majesty, your Heirs and Successors, any Honors, Manors, Castles, Houses, Places, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments or Chattels real whatsoever, in all, every or any of the Counties, Baronies, Cities, Towns, Corporate, and walled Towns in this Kingdom on the 23. day of Octo∣ber 1641. belonging in Possession, Reversion or Remainder unto the Vniversity of Dublin, or to any Archbishop, Bishop, Dean, Prebend, Dean and Chapter, or other Ecclesiastical person or persons in his or their politick capacity, or to any other Col∣lege, Hospital, Church Collegiate or Parochial, or to the Church-wardens and Parishioners of any Parish-Church for the use of the said Church, or to any Guild, Corporation, or Fraternity Ecclesiastical or Lay, or to any Parson, Rector, or Vicar of any Parish-Church, or to the most Reverend Father in God, John Lord Arch-Bishop of Armagh, Primate and Metropolitan of all Ireland, or to James Duke of Ormond,

His Majesties GRACIOUS DECLARATION FOR The Settlement of His Kingdome of Ireland, and satisfaction of the several Interests of Ad∣venturers, Souldiers, and other His Sub∣jects there. CHarles the Second, by the Grace of God King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defen∣der of the Faith, &c. To all Our loving Sub∣jects of Our Kingdome of Ireland, of what degree or quality soever, Greeting: It having pleased Almighty God out of his great mercy and compassion to∣wards Vs, and all Our Subjects, to restore Vs in so won∣derful a manner to each other, and with so wonderful cir∣cumstances of affection and confidence in each other, as must for ever fill Our Hearts (if We are in any degree sensi∣ble of such Blessings) with an humble and grateful ac∣knowledgement of the Obligation We owe to His Divine Providence, That he would vouchsafe to work that miracle for Vs himself, which no endeavours of Our own could bring to pass: We think it agreable to the just sense We have, and ought to have of the good affection of all Our good Subjects, who have contributed so much in bringing this unspeakable Blessing upon Vs & themselves, that We acknowledge that our good Subjects in Our Kingdome of Ireland have born a very good part in procuring this happiness, that they were early in their dutiful Addresses to Vs, and made the same professions
of a resolution to return to their Duty and Obedience to Vs, during the time of Our being beyond the Seas, which they have since so eminently made good, and put in practise: How∣ever it was not easy for us to make any publick Declaration with reference to that Our Kingdome, there being many dif∣ficulties, in the providing for, and complying with the seve∣ral Interests and Pretences there, which We were bound in Honour and Iustice in some degree to take care of, and which were different from the difficulties We were to contend with in this Kingdome: We well knew the Acts of Parliament which had formerly past for the security of the Adventurers in that Kingdom, & had heard of the proceedings which had been thereupon, by which very many Officers, Souldiers, and o∣thers, as well of this, as that Our Kingdome, were in pos∣session of a great part of the Lands of that Our Kingdom, and of whose Interests we resolve to be very careful. We well remember the Cessation, and the Peace which Our Royal Father of blessed Memory had been forced during the late troubles to make with the Irish Subjects of that Our Kingdome, and by which he was compelled to give them a full pardon for what they had before done amiss upon their return to their Duty, and their promise of giving his Majesty a vi∣gorous assistance, and that from that time divers persons of Honour and Quality had not (that We know or have heard of) swerved from their Allegiance towards him or Vs. We could not forget the Peace that Our self was afterwards ne∣cessitated to make with Our said Subjects, in the time when they who wickedly Vsurped the Authority in this Kingdome, had erected that Odious Court for the taking away of the Life of Our dear Father; And then no body can wonder that we were desirous, though upon difficult conditions, to get such an Vnited power of Our own Subjects, as might have been able, with Gods blessing, to have prevented that infamous and horrible Parricide. And therefore We could not but hold Our self obliged to perform what we owe by that Peace, to those who had honestly and faithfuly performed what they had promised to Vs, though We and they were miserably disappointed of the effect of those promises, by an unhappy part of them which foolishly forfeited all the Grace which they might have expected from Vs. And in the last place, We did and must alwayes remember the great affection a considerable part of that Nation exprest to Vs, during the time of Our being beyond the Seas, when with all cheerfulnes and obedience they received & submitted to Our Orders, and betook themselves to that service which We dire∣cted as most convenient and behoofeful at that time to Vs,
though attended with inconveniencie enough to themselves: Which demeanour of theirs, cannot but be thought very wor∣thy of Our Protection, Iustice and Favour: And yet all these important considerations and obligations appeared so many contradictions to the present Interest of Our good Sub∣jects in that Our Kingdome, who had at this time likewise merited very much from Vs, and for whose security and ad∣vantage We held Our self obliged, to provide as well as for their Indempnity, and so the good Settlement of that Our Kingdome appeared much the more difficult unto Vs, and even lessened and abated much of that joy of heart We found Our self possessed with, for the great blessings We enjoy in the peace and quiet of this our Kingdome of England. But We raised Our spirits again with the comfortable as∣surance that God who had wrought so much for Vs in England would graciously bring his Work to the same perfection in Ire∣land, & not suffer Our good Subjects to weep in the one King∣dome, whilest they rejoyced in the other: And Our satisfacti∣on was much increased, when upon conference with seve∣ral of Our good Subjects (of that Nation) of Quality and Interest, who were concerned both as Souldiers and Adven∣turers, We found that they had a due sense of the Obligations which say upon Our Honour and Iustice; and were very willing, that We should comply with both, and that the Foundations of the Peace and Security of that Kingdom should be raised upon Our discharge of those Obligations; and after they had spent much time amongst others, who were as much, or more con∣cerned than themselves, they freely consented to such conclu∣sions as to Our understanding may reasonably take with all just Interests: And We cannot doubt but that all who have merited from Vs, will confess that We have been so far from being failing to them, that We have as well provided for them, as after so great Troubles and Confusions, and after such blessed Circumstances of Our Restauraton, they could reason∣ably expect, and that they will patiently wait for further in∣stances of Our Favour and Kindness towards them, from the Peace, Vnity, and Settlement of that Kingdome, and from their contributing to it by a full submission to these Our determinations herein, and hereafter more particularly ex∣pressed and declared. And therefore in the first place, in Order to a Settlement of that Interest claimed by the Adventurers, although the pre∣sent Estates and Possessions they enjoy, if they were examined by the strict Letter of the Law, would prove very defective and invalid, as being no wayes pursuant to those Acts of Parlia∣ment
upon which they pretend to be founded, but rather seem to be a structure upon their subsequent assent, both to different Mediums and Ends, than the observance of those: Yet We being alwayes more ready to consult (where the prejudice can only reflect upon Our self) with Our natural inclinations to mercy (We praise God We can say so) than with the po∣sitive Reason of Law: We do hereby declare, That all the Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, of which all or a∣ny of the Adventurers were possessed the Seventh day of May, One thousand Six hundred Fifty nine, having been allotted or set out to them, or enjoyed by them as Adventurers in sa∣tisfaction of, and for their Adventures, shall be confirmed and made good to them, their Heirs, and Assigns for ever, with allowance or correction of the Admeasurement, according to the Tenor & Directions of the respective Acts of Parliament of XVII and XVIII Caroli, as to English or Plantation Mea∣sure; except as is hereafter excepted: and that the defici∣ent Adventurer, either in part or in whole, shall be satisfied out of the Moiety of the Counties of Limrick, Tipperary, and Waterford, in the Province of Munster, the Kings County, the Queens County, and the Counties of East-Meath and West-Meath, in the Province of Leinster, and the Counties of Down, Antrim, and Armagh, in the Province of Ulster, not yet set out to the said Adventurers; as also the Forfeited Lands in the County of Lowth, (except the Barony of Atherdee in the said County) and said Province of Leinster, such Adventu∣rers claiming and making their difficiencies appear before the First day of May next: and in case the said Lands so for supply of deficiencies set forth, shall not be sufficient, We will appoint some other convenient Forfeited Lands for their satis∣faction, so that all their deficiencies shall speedily be sup∣plied. And whereas the Officers and Souldiers now of Our Army in Ireland, and that have been formerly of the Army in Ire∣land, have had also Lands set out to them respectively, in sa∣tisfrction of their arrears of Pay for their Service in that Our Kingdome, and are accordingly possest of the same by former pretended Orders and Powers then in being: And although the incompetency of such Powers may justly ren∣der such Possessions and Estates liable to question, to Our ve∣ry great advantage, if We should measure such advantage, rather by the increase of Our Revenue, then by the free and unbounded influence of Our Mercy and Favour: Yet in re∣gard of Our Letter to General Monk from Breda, in the Twelfth Year of Our Reign, and of Our several Declarati∣one and Proclamations concerning the Army, and of the full
assurance of the forwardness and readiness of the said Army, and loving Subjects in Ireland to contribute, as in Duty bound, all that in them lay for Our Restauration, We are pleased of Our special Grace and Favour to Declare, and do hereby Declare, That all Officers and Souldiers, their Heirs, and Assigns, who have been, and are of the said Ar∣my in Ireland, and to whom Lands have been given out in sa∣tisfaction of their Arrears for their Service in that Our King∣dome, and have by the general Convention of Ireland, or by a∣ny other publick Act declared submission and obedience to Vs, according to Our said Declaration of the 4/14 of April last, da∣ted at Breda, shall enjoy their respective Estates conferred on them for their Arrears, for Service in the Kingdome of Ire∣land, according to their respective Possessions on the said Se∣venth Day of May, One thousand Six hundred Fifty nine, in full satisfaction of all such Arrears, for which Lands were set out to them respectively as aforesaid; so that they, and e∣very of them, having received an equal proportion with others in the like case, are, and shall be for ever barred from deman∣ding or receiving any further satisfaction therefore, although they had allowance but for Thirteen shillings in the Pound, or thereabouts. Excepting alwayes out of all such Settle∣ments to the said Adventurers and Souldiers, all and every such Estate, and Estates, wherein, or in procuring whereof, a∣ny Bribery, Forgery, Perjury, Subornation of Witnes∣ses hath been used or practised, as also such part of any Estate hereby declared to be setled as aforesaid, which by false or un∣due Admeasurement hath been set forth, such Offence and Crime being discovered before the Twentieth day of Decem∣ber, One Thousand Six hundred Sixty one. Excepting al∣so the Estate of all and every such person, or persons, that is, or are excepted in one Act past this present Parliament at Westminster, Entituled, An Act of Free and General Pardon, Indempnity, and Oblivion. Excepting also all such Lands as are commonly called Church-Lands, whether the same belong to Arch-Bishops, Bishops, or other Ecclesiastical per∣sons whatsoever, that have been set out to Adventurers, Souldiers, or others: Neither shall this extend to give any benefit to such person or persons, as have, or shall by any o∣vert Act proveably done, or to be done by him, or them, subse∣quent to Our Restauration, endeavour the disturbance of the publick Peace, or have manifested any aversion to Our Re∣stauration and Government, it being but very reasonable that the Abusers of so much Mercy held forth by Vs, should not be partakers thereof. And excepting all such Estates, statutes, Mortgages, Iudgements, Leases, Lands, Tenements,
and Hereditaments, and other profits and advantages, which have been decreed to any of Our Subjects by the respective Courts of Claims, and Court of Exchequer in Ireland, and the said Decrees not since reversed, although the premis∣ses are yet possest, or witheld from those who have obtained the said Decrees by Adventurers, Souldiers, or others, to whom the same were set out, who are to be reprized in like manner as others provided for by this Declaration. And whereas several legal Incumbrances do, and may rest upon the Lands set out to Adventurers and Souldiers as a∣foresaid, We are pleased further graciously to declare, That the said Adventurers and Souldiers shall receive satisfaction out of the forfeited Lands in the County of Kildare, saving the Lands and Estate of Christopher Eustace, commonly cal∣led Mad-Eustace, in the said County, or elsewhere, which it is Our Will and Pleasure be forthwith restored to him and his Heirs, for all Statutes, Recognizances, Iudgements, Mortgages, Dowers, Ioyntures, Lease for Life, or Lives, or for Years, Rent-Charge, or other such Incumbrances charged on their Estates, such Incumbrances being made ap∣pear by the 22. of October, 1661. before such as shall be there∣unto Commissioned with all convenient speed after this De∣claration. Being sensible, That several Officers who were engaged in Our Service in Ireland, and eminently acted and suffered therein, have by the partiality and injustice of the Powers then in being, received no satisfaction for the same, We are therefore further pleased graciously to declare, That all Com∣missioned Officers, their Heirs, or Assigns, who were in Re∣giments, Troops, or Companies, raised in Ireland, or transported out of England, and served Our Royal Father, or Our Self in the Wars in Ireland, at any time before the Fifth of June, 1649. other then those who have received Lands or Money, for their pay due unto them since the Fifth Day of June, 1649. shall be satisfied their respective personal Arrears out of the particulars following, viz. Out of the forfeited Lands, Tenements, and Heredita∣ments, undisposed of to Adventurers or Souldiers, in the Counties of Wickloe, Longford, Leytrim, and Donnegal: Out of all the Forfeited Lands, Tenements, and Heredita∣ments, undisposed of in the Province of Connaught and County of Clare, lying within one mile of the River Shanon, (or of the Sea) commonly called the Mile-Line: Out of all the Houses and Tenements Forfeited in Ireland, in the seve∣ral Walled Towns and Corporations, and Lands thereunto belonging, not already set out to the Adventurers or Soul∣diers
in satisfaction of Adventures and Arrears, satisfacti∣on being first made to such Protestants, who on Leases, or Contracts for Leases, have built or repaired Houses, or plan∣ted Orchards or Gardens, except the Houses, Tenements, and Hereditaments, in the Town of Wexford, already set out un∣to Martin Noel, and John Arthur, and now in their possession, which shall be confirmed to them, their Heirs and Assigns, out of the benefit arising from the Redemption of Mortga∣ges, Statutes, Staples, and Iudgements, where the Lands are not already disposed of to Adventurers or Souldiers. Ex∣cepting alwayes hereout such Mortgages, Statutes, Iudge∣ments, as any Forfeiting persons of Ireland hath, or had on the Estate of James Lord Marquess of Ormond, Lord Steward of Our Houshold, or the Lady Marchioness his Wife, out of one Years Rent and Profits of the Lands set out to the Offi∣cers and Souldiers for their Arrears in the Year 1653. And likewise of the Army now in being, according as those respe∣ctive said Estates yielded in the Year 1659. As also out of one year and a halfs Rent, and Profits arising out of the Lands for the Arrears of those Officers and Souldiers who were ordered, or received satisfaction for their said Arrears, in the Years, 1655, 1656, and 1657. according as the Estates yielded in the Year 1659. And it is further Declared, That all Commissioned Offi∣cers before One thousand Six hundred Forty nine, who have had no satisfaction in Lands, or otherwise, set out to them for Services, since One thousand Six hundred Forty nine, shall be immediately, out of the whole Security, that is a∣bove assigned for satisfaction of Arrears before One thousand six hundred Forty nine, satisfied Twelve shillings Six pence in the Pound of what is due to them: And then the remai∣ning part of all the said respective Securities to be equally divided amongst all and every the said Commissioned Offi∣cers, who have any Arrears due for Services in Ireland, be∣fore One thousand Six hundred Forty nine: All which Rents above said and profits, shall be paid in such way and manner, as shall be by Vs appointed: And also the said Houses, Lands, and Tenements, distributed and set out in such way and manner, as we shall appoint for the ends and uses aforesaid, the said Years Rent to be paid in the space of Two Years by even and equal proportions, half yearly; And the said Year and a halfs Rent in three years, by even and equal porti∣ons half yearly: For which Service, as also for stating the Arrears of the Commissioned Officers aforesaid, not yet sta∣ted, fit persons shall be speedily by Vs Authorized. All which said Arrears, so to be stated, shall be stated before
the Twenty nineth day of September, One thousand Six hundred Sixty one: And the several particulars for the a∣bove security for Officers, serving before One thousand Six hundred Forty nine, shall be immediately put out of Charge in Our Court of Exchequer: Whereof Our Chief Baron, and other Our Ministers of the said Court, are hereby requi∣red to take notice, and put the same in execution according∣ly. And the said Securities are hereby committed and in∣trusted into the hands of such persons for the uses aforesaid, As the Duke of Albermarle, General of all Our Armies, and the Lord Marquess of Ormond, Lord Steward of Our Houshold, by Vs hereby thereunto Authorized shal appoint, to be by them Let and set for the best advantage, and to the ends afore∣said: And they are also to Assign sit and convenient Sala∣ries for such persons as shall be imployed therein, The said Salaries to be assigned unto them out of the Profits of the said Securities. That such Protestants, whose Estates have been given out for satisfaction of Adventurers or Souldiers, or otherwise dis∣posed of to any other persons, shall be forthwith restored to their former Estates, and a Reprizal of equal Value, Worth, and Purchase forthwith Assigned to such Adventurers or Soul∣diers, as shall be removed out of their said Estates. Provi∣ded no person or persons shall have the benefit hereof, who were in the Rebellion before the Fifteenth of September, One thousand Six hundred Forty and three, and have taken out Decrees for Lands in the Province of Connaught, or County of Clare, in recompence of their former Estates. And that such Adventurer, Souldier, or other persons, who have been, or shall be removed from the Estate of James Lord Marquess of Ormond, Lord Steward of Our Houshold, for what he pos∣sest therefore for Adventure or Arrears, shall be Reprized in the County of Catherlaugh for the same; every person so to be re∣moved shall not be accomptable for the Profits he received, whilest he or they enjoyed such Estates. Provided alwayes, That this Our Declaration, or any thing or matter therein contained, shall not extend to any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, which James Lord Marquess of Ormond, Lord Steward of Our Houshold, or any of his Ancestors, Ba∣rons of Arckloe, Viscounts of Thurles, or Earles of Ormond, or Ossory, did at any time heretofore Mortgage, Grant, or Demise unto any person or persons in Fee, Fee-Farm, Fee-Tail, for Life or for Years, or for any other Estate or Inte∣rest; nor to any Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, held of the said James Lord Marquess of Ormond, mediately or immediately, as of any of his Manors, whereby the For∣feited,
or Forfeitable Interest of any person or persons, in such Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, as aforesaid, may be set∣led in any Adventurer, Souldier, or any person whatsoever, o∣ther than the said James Marquess of Ormond and his Heirs: Provided that this shall not extend to any of the Lands held of James Marquess of Ormond, or the Lady Marchioness his Wife, as of any their Manors; but that all such Lands shall be held of the said James, and the Lady Marchioness, and their Heirs, by the same Tenure, and at the same Rents and Services as heretofore, any thing in this Our Declaration to the contrary contained notwithstanding. And whereas the Earl of Inchequin hath been dispossessed of his Estate, for his eminent Service, and adhering unto Vs, and is now by Act of Parliament ordered to be restored to his said Estate, We are graciously pleased hereby further to De∣clare, That he be accordingly restored to his said Estate, and that such who shall thereby e removed, and are justly capable of reprize, that they shall be reprized, as others in lke cases are to be reprised. And whereas we understand, that by the te u∣surped Powers, during the Distempers of these Ti several Irish Proprietors of the Popish Religion, have been dispossessed of their Estates, meerly for being Papists, and have shed out Decrees, and are possessed of Lands in the Province of Con∣naught, and County of Clare, in compensation of their for∣mer Estates, which being an Act of their own, We might without any injustice deny to relieve them in, yet so willing We are that any Interest intituling in self to Equitable mer∣cy mght not be disappointed, that We declare, That all in∣nocent Papists, being such as shall prove themselves to have been Faithful and Loyal unto, and never acted against Our Royal Father or Our Self, since the two and twentieth day of October, One thousand six hundred forty one, though they have sued out Decrees, and are possessed of Lands in the Pro∣vince of Connaught, or County of Clare, in lieu of their for∣mer Estates, shall notwithstanding be restored to their said Estates by the second of May, One thousand six hundred Sixty one; Provided that the said Lands in Connaught and Clare so allotted to the said Papists, be restored unto Vs to Reprise others, or for satisfaction of such Irish Proprietors thereof, so far as this Declaration excludes them not; or if the said Lands in Connaught and Clare, or any part thereof, have been sold by any such Papist, that the said Papist out of his Estate, to which he is to be restored, shall pay the Pur∣chase-Money to the said Purchaser, his Heirs, or Assigns; and whosoever either by Reprize or Restauration shall enjoy the said Lands, shall make satisfaction to the said Purcha∣ser,
for all necessary Reparations and Improvements upon the said Lands, before he be admitted to the possession of them; Provided also, That whatsoever Adventurer or Souldier that shall be removed from his present possession, to make room for any such Papist, shall forthwith have a Reprize of e∣qual value, worth and purchase, in other Forfeited Lands. Provided alwayes, That whereas the Corporations of Ire∣land are now planted with English, who have considerably im∣proved at their own Charges, and brought Trade and Ma∣nufacture into that Our Kingdom, and by their Settlment there do not a little contribute to the Peace and Settlement of that Country, the disturbing or removal of which English would in many respects be very prejudicial; That all such of the Popish Religion, of any Corporations in Ireland, who have been for Publick security dispossessed of their Estates, within any Corporation, shall be forthwith Reprized in For∣feited Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, neer the said Corporations, to the full Value, Worth, and Purchase of such Estate, as he was dispossest of within such Corporation; And that particularly the Popish Inhabitants of Cork, Youg∣hall, and Kingsale, shall have undisposed Forfeited Lands set out to them in the Baronies of Barrimore and Muskerry in the County of Cork, according to their respective Decrees past in that behalf; Provided that in the case of innocent Papists within the said respective Corporations, that were dispossessed as aforesaid, it shall remain in His Majesties Power to grant restitution in like manner, as is provided in the case of other innocent Papists. We are also graciously pleased, that the Lands and Hou∣ses set out to any person or persons, for satisfaction of any Mo∣ney lent, or publick Debts incurred for Provisions, Armes, or Ammunition, furnished for support of Our Army in Ire∣land, in the beginning of the Rebellion, shall be and remain disposeable for the satisfaction of such of the said Debts, and Debentures for such Debts, as upon examination of the re∣spective Cases shall appear most deserving consideration and satisfaction, in such proportions as shall be thought most equal and just. We are likewise graciously pleased to declare, That the Lands set out to George Duke of Albermarle, Captain General of Our Armies of England, Scotland and Ireland, for his Ar∣rears and Service in Ireland, as also the Lands being for Ar∣rears purchased by him, and whereof he is now possessed; and the Lands setled upon Roger Earl of Orrery, Charles Earl of Mountrath, Richard Lord Baron of Caloony, Chidley Coote, and Thomas Coote Esquires; the Relict and Heirs of Sir
Simon Harcourt, Sir William Penn, and the Relict and Chil∣dren of Col. George Cook, Sir Theophilus Jones, Sir. George Ayscough, and the Orphans of Colonel Owen O Connelly, for their Service and Sufferings in the War of Ireland, As al∣so the Lands set out to Richard Urial, and Thomas Crostthwart; of One hundred Pounds per annum; As also all such Lands; Tenements, and Hereditaments, as Arthur Lord Viscount of Valentia, hath purchased from any persons in actual possessi∣on thereof, by virtue of any Grant, Order or disposition of the late Vsurped Powers, or any of them, shall be setled and confirmed unto them, their Heirs and Assigns respectively: And also that Lands be set out to Major George Rawdoh in satisfaction of Debentures, due to him for Arrears and Pro∣visions furnished for Ireland; Provided alwayes, and We do hereby declare, that it is not Our intention thereby to weaken or avoid the Iust and Legal Citie of any Person, that is restoreable by this Our Declaration; But that if any of the said Estates shall be accordingly restored to the former Proprietor, that then a Reprize of equal Value, Worth, and Purchase, shall forthwith be assigned in lieu thereof. And as We cannot but with extraordinary sadness of heart remember, and even at present behold the desolate and distra∣cted condition, that Our Kingdome of Ireland hath been, and is reduced unto, by the unnatural Insurrection, begun in the Year One thousand Six hundred Forty one, and conse∣quently abhor and detest the Contrivers and obstinate Pro∣moters of the same against Vs, Our Crown and Dignity: So We cannot upon the considerations formerly exprest in this Our Declaration, deny all Iust and Reasonable Provi∣sion that may stand with the present Iuncture of Our Affairs unto such of the Irish Nation, who not onely gave early Evi∣dences of their Repentance for their Crimes, but also perse∣vered in their Loyalty to Vs and Our Commands: And that as near as We can, Our Iustice and Our Mercy, in ac∣commodating this Interest might not justle each other, We are in a different manner to consider of such of them as are justly Entituled to the Benefit of those Articles of Peace formerly mentioned, and such who did not submit unto the same, or after a submission, made a departue from the same, which two latter sorts, have justly forfeited that Favour which otherwise they might have received. We are also further to consider of those who embraced the said Articles, and submit∣ted to the said Peace without any Apostacy in a different noti∣on, as of those who remained in that Our Kingdome, who su∣ed out Decrees and received Lands, in satisfaction of their an∣cient Estates, and those who being Transported into Forreign
parts, through many difficulties, Vnited, Rendevouzed, and served under Our Obedience: So that upon these consi∣derations, We think fit and declare, and accordingly do declare, That as to those who imbraced the said Articles, and submit∣ted to the said Peace, and constantly adhered thereunto, and remaining at home, sued out Decrees, and obtained pos∣session of Lands in the Province of Connaught, or County of Clare, that they are to stand bound by them, and not to be re∣lieved against their own Act, who contented themselves to enjoy a part of satisfaction for their own, rather than to at∣tend our Restitution, or submit themselves to Our Com∣mand in Forreign parts as others did; And yet if the condi∣tions of those seem hard, they can no more reasonably expect that We should further relieve them, than Our friends in England and Ireland can expect that we should pay back to them all the Moneys they were compelled in the evil Times to pay for their Compositions; which they would have avoided, had it been in their power. And in case any justly Entituled to the said Peace, have, ob∣tained Decrees for Lands in the Province of Connaught, or County of Clare, in lieu of their former Estate, and have not been possest of lands according to such their respective De∣crees, We further declare, That if by the First day of No∣vember, One thousand Six hundred Sixty one, they shall not be possest of such Decreed lands, they shall immediately after the said day he otherwise satisfied for the same. And as to those who continued with Vs, or served faith∣fully under Our Ensignes beyond the Seas, We think fit, and accordingly declare, That they shall be restored to their former Estates, if they by themselves, or Agents Authorised by them, have not prosecuted and obtained Decrees and lands in the Province of Connaught or County of Clare, in compensation of their former Estates, a Reprize being first assigned, and le∣gally set out of the remaining Forfeited lands undisposed of, to such Adventurer or Souldier, or other person before na∣med, of equal Value, Worth and Purchase to the Estate, out of which, such Adventurer or Souldier, or other person aforesaid, shall be so removed; Yet so, that if any Charge, Debt, or other legal incumbrance have been due upon, or out of any such lands, so to be restored, which by law or good Con∣science ought to be discharged by the party so to be restored, And that the said Charges, Debts, or Incumbrances, have been discharged or satisfied by the party, his Heirs or Assigns, from whom such lands are now to be Reprized, that such persons, their Heirs or Assignes may, and shall hold the said lands until they are satisfied, and contented of and for
the same: And that none of the persons so to be removed, shall be accountable for the Rents or Profits of the Estates out of which they shall be so removed, which Rents and Pro∣fits, and Arrears of Rents, they are respectively to receive until they are possest of other Estates as aforesaid, as also rea∣sonable consideration for reparations of Houses, and other necessary improvements made, and to be seen upon the pre∣misses, wherein like regard is to be had to the respective Te∣nants and Lessees for their Improvements, but where the Landlord took Fine, he is to be accountable for the same, to∣wards satisfaction for their Improvements who paid the said Fine: And lest such Restorations and Reprizes, if not speedily effected, might be attended with many prejudi∣ces, to all parties concerned therein, We declare that the farthest time for accomplishing thereof, shall be by the Three and Twentieth day of October, One thousand Six hundred Sixty and one. And whereas divers persons, for most of whom a general provision is made by this Our Declaration, have for Reasons known unto Vs, in an especial manner merited Our Grace and Favour; particularly the Earl of Clanricard, the Earl of Westmeath, the Earl of Fingal, the Earl of Clancartie, the Lord Viscount Gormanstown, the Lord Viscount Mountgar∣ret, the Lord Viscount Dillon, the Lord Viscount Taaffe, the Lord Viscount Ikerryn, the Lord Viscount Nettervill, the Lord Viscount Galmoy, the Lord Viscount Mayo, the Lord Baron of Dunboyn, the Lord Baron of Trimletstown, the Lord Baron of Dunsany, the Lord Baron of Vpper Ossory, the Lord Ber∣mingham, Baron of Arthunry, the Lord Baron of Strabane, Colonel Richard Butler, Sir George Hamilton Knight and Baronet, Sir Richard Barnewel Baronet, Sir.

And though some, not sensible of the great perplexities We have laboured under, to reconcile these Iarring Interests, may infer, That where We judge persons sitting to be restored to their Estates, yet the limitation of a previous Reprizal may Eclipse much of Our Grace: To this We say, That the laying of the Foundations is not now before Vs, when We might design the Model of the Structure answerable to Our own thoughts; And how hard it would be, that the English after so many expensive difficulties in Suits of Law, and finding several Officers in Order to get the present possession they enjoy: And that after so many thousands of Families, who have sold their Interests in England, have transported and settled themselves in Ireland, and have made great im∣provements in Buildings and otherwise, should in the In∣terval of these accommodations (Reprisal not being first pro∣vided for) be dispossessed of their Houses and their Stocks
(the sole subsistance of them and their Families) exposed to certainty of loss (though greater inconveniencies We pretermit) may easily be judged: To this We might adde, That since the persons of the Irish, for whom we do hereby in∣tend satisfaction, are such who have been abroad with Vs, who probably being not furnished with Stock and other Pro∣visions, may with less inconveniencies wait for a Reprizal, than to dispossess others, especially since we are fully assured that a very short time may and will Assign them their respec∣tive Reprizals, there being so good and large a proportion of undisposed Forfeited lands in Our Power reserved for this purpose, and We doubt not but the persons most concerned in this supposed prejudice, throughly weighing these inconveni∣encies, and that they will be but of a short duration, and how great and reasonable a dissatisfaction a contrary acting in Vs will produce, will acquiesce therein, & by such a forbearance lay the Foundation of a good Vnderstanding between themselves & those other their fellow-subjects who are to be settled with them in that Our Kingdome. And least any Ambiguity or contro∣versy might arise for precedency in restitution to their former Rights, We do Declare, That first all innocent Protestants, and those persons termed innocent Papists, (who never took out any Decree, or had lands assigned to them in Con∣naught or Clare) be first restored. In the next place, That those innocent Protestants and Papists, who took out Decrees, and had lands allotted to them in pursuance thereof in Con∣naught or Clare shall be restored. And that such transplanted persons as shall be dispossest of their Decreed Estates in Con∣naught or Clare, by virtue of this Our Declaration, shall be Reprized out of other Forfeited lands of equal value, worth, and purchase in the said Province of Connaught, or County of Clare, or elsewhere, before they be dispossest of their said E∣states. And that then such of the Irish Papists who constant∣ly served under Our Ensigns abroad, having right to the Ar∣ticles of Peace, are to be restored, of which if any dispute shall be of their Capacity of Priviledge herein, We shall by further intimation of Our pleasure to Our Chief Governour or Governours in that Our Kingdome, and Council there, give a final Resolve and Determination therein. Yet this is alwayes so to be understood, That whatsoever person or persons in the next precedent Qualifications shall find any part of his or their Estates, not already disposed, or not de∣signed to be disposed to the ends aforesaid, exprest in this Our Declaration, That such person or persons, their Heirs, or Assigns, shall be respectively restored to his or their said Estates. And We further declare, That in respect many have con∣tracted
very just Debts for furnishing Armes, Ammunition, and other necessary provisions for carrying on the War in Ire∣land, before One thousand Six hundred Forty nine, for which they have given security, and so made themselves liable to suit and hazard, which in all equity ought to be provided for; That after such Reprizals made as aforesaid, satisfaction shall be set forth out of the remaining lands in Our disposal, to such persons, their Heirs and Assigns. And We are graciously pleased further to Declare, That every Adventurer and Souldier, their Heirs and Assigns, set∣led in lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, as aforesaid; And every person restored unto, or Reprized for his Estate, as is formerly mentioned, shall pay unto Vs, Our Heires and Successors yearly for ever, the Rents following, viz. For eve∣ry Acre in the Province of Leinster Three pence: For every Acre in the Province of Munster Two pence Farthing: For every Acre in the Province of Connaught One penny Half pen∣ny; And for every Acre in the Province of Ulster One penny, accounting as to the payment of the said Rent only, One hundred and Sixty Pearches to the Acre, and Sixteen Foot and a half to the Pearch. And all such as receive satisfaction for their Arrears out of the Houses and Tenements in the several corporations in Ireland, one shilling six pence yearly out of eve∣ry Twenty shillings Rent, so that the Rent formerly reserved on such Estates so to be restored, exceed not the Rent hereby re∣served. But if the said Rent formerly reserved do exceed the Rent hereby to be reserved, the said former Rent only shall be paid, and the said Estates respectively shall be discharged from payment of the Rent or Rents hereby reserved. And it is Our further pleasure, and We do hereby declare, That all Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments thus settled and to be settled upon Adventurers, shall be held of Vs, Our Heirs and Successors in Free and common Soccage, as in the Sta∣tute of the Seventeenth Caroli is limited and appointed; And that all Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments setled or to be setled on the Souldiers who are out of the said Act, and not provided for by it, shall be held of Vs, Our Heirs and Suc∣cessors by Knights service, in Capite. All other particulars above mentioned being fully effected, we trust through the goodness of God, that that near ruined Kingdom will be restored to peace & plenty. And that by such sig∣nal evidences of our justice, favor, & mercy, the wicked will be de∣terred from their wickedness, & the good encouraged & confirmed in resolutions of loyalty towards us, and peace among one ano∣ther. And as in this Our Declaration, we have made choice of those means, which in Our Wisdome and Iudgement We
have esteemed most conducible to the Quiet and Settlement of that Our Kingdome, so We esteem it necessary further to de∣clare, That it is Our firm intention forthwith to call a Par∣liament in that Our Kingdom, and effectually to recommend unto Our Chief Governour or Governours, Privy Council, and Our said Parliament, the establishing by Laws there, all the particulars mentioned in this Our Declaration, and such others as shall be found necessary for the good of Our People there; and after such Bills are past, that then an Act of Free and General Pardon, Indempnity and Oblivon, shall be granted to all Our Subjects of and in Ireland, notorious Mur∣derers only excepted. And because We are too credibly assured, That in the De∣crees and Iudgements given for Forfeited lands in the Pro∣vince of Connaught and County of Clare, much injustice and fraud hath been used, We shall recommend the whole review of that business to Our Chief Governour or Governours for the time being, and Our Privy Council and Commissioners or some of them, to the end, that whatever irregularity shall be found in those proceedings may by their Care and Wisdome be rectified, and the Iust part thereof confirmed. As also, that a suitable Act for Ireland for confirming Iudicial pro∣ceedings there in the four Courts, may be there past; And a∣nother Act for ratifying all Decrees and Iudgements in the Court of Claims, and Exchequer of Dublin, and the Claims of Our Protestant Subjects of Ireland, that so all Our Sub∣jects being legally setled and confirmed in their lives, proper∣ties and Estates, they may without fear for the Future be∣take themselves to mend the Ruines and Desolations of so long and bloody War, and live in comfort and unity. And We more than hope that by Our thus proceeding, the World will believe nothing of Our own Advantage can come in com∣petition with the Peace and Good of Our Subjects; for We reserve little to Our Self but the satisfaction of contenting all Interests, at the price of freely parting with almost all the great Forfeitures vested in Vs by Law in that Our Kingdom: And if by this Indulgence We shall attain that desired end, it will be much more considerable unto Vs, than the rate at which We purchase it. And We further Declare, That whereas several of the Adventurers and Souldiers having made a thankful estima∣tion of our grace and favour expressed by this our Declaration, in settling them in a peaceable possession and right of what they enjoy, by Our waving those many advantages devolved upon us by law, have voluntarily exprest their own willingness and confidence of the forwardness of all the rest of their Brethren,
in contributing One half years full value of the profits ari∣sing of the said lands as aforesaid, set out for their respe∣ctive Adventures and Arrears, to be paid in One year, to∣wards the Relief and Reparations of the losses of such as We shall judge have most eminently acted for, and suffered with Vs; And that several of the Adventurers having expressed their own willingness, and confidence of the forwardness of the rest of the Adventurers to bestow upon Vs as a further evidence of that thankfulness, in consideration of Our Grace and Favour in the aforesaid Settlement, One other half years Rent more of full value to be paid in One other year: We can∣not but declare Our Acceptance of such their free and kinde offer; and when a Bill shall be tendred unto Vs upon the ac∣compt, and for the ends aforesaid, it shall be received by Vs as graciously as such an evidence of their affection and respect doth deserve. And We do lastly declare, That Protestant Plantations shall be settled, Corporations created, Churches erected, Main∣tenance for Preaching Ministers provided, within the limits and precincts of the land so to be settled on the Adventurers and Souldiers, in such manner as by the Commissioners to be nominated and directed by Vs, shall be set down. Provided always, That this Our Declaration shall not extend to any person or persons who have had any hand in the plotting and contriving the Surprisal of Our Castle of Dub∣lin, in the year One thousand six hundred forty one; nor to any person or persons that sate as Iudges in the pretended High Court of Iustice upon the life of Our Royal Father of blessed memory, or who sentenced Him, or signed or sealed the War∣rant for Execution, or who were of the Guard of Halbertiers, assisting to put the Bloody Sentence of Death in Execution upon the 30. of January, One thousand six hundred forty & eight. Provided lastly, and it is hereby declared, That this De∣claration, or any thing therein contained, shall not extend to confirm the disposition or setting out to any Adventurer, Sol∣dier, or other person, any of the Lands, Tenements or Here∣ditaments, belonging before the 23. of October 1641. to any City, or Sea-Town Incorporated, but that the same shall be and remain in Our own hands to be restored to such of the said Corporations as shall be found fit for that Our Grace and Fa∣vour; and the Adventurers, Souldiers or others, who have any of the said Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments set out unto them, shall be Reprized in like manner as is provided for them in other cases, by this Declaration. Given at Our Court at Whitehall the 30. day of November 1660. In the Twelfth Year of Our Reign.

C. R. WHEREAS by Our said Declaration of the thir∣tieth of November, One thousand six hundred and sixty, We have made provision for the Settlement of Our Kingdome of Ireland, and Satisfaction of the several Interests of Adventurers, Souldiers and others Our Sub∣jects there, which we are minded to put in effectual Execution: We have therefore hereby nominated you, or any five or more of you, whereof two of the persons following to be alwayes present, (viz.) Our Trusty and Right well beloved Cousin and Counsellour Arthur Lord Viscount Valentia, Our Vice-Treasurer and General Receiver of Our said Realm, Our Trusty and well beloved Counsellour Sir James Barry, James Donelan Esq and John Bysse Esq Sir James Ware, Our At∣turney, and Solicitor General, Our Commissioners for the putting in Execution the matters and things therein contain∣ed, according to the Tenor of these following Instructions. You are to cast up the whole Debt and Demand of the Ad∣venturers, as well those that are satisfied, as those that are in part or in whole deficient, as also all the forfeited Lands assigned to, or for the said Adventurers, according to the Sur∣vey commonly called Doctor Petty's Down Admeasurement: And the said Demands and Lands you are to compare toge∣ther, and what the said Lands fall short of satisfying the said Adventurers, according to the Rates, Measures and Propor∣tions, of which all or any of the Adventurers were possessed the Seventh of May One thousand six hundred fifty nine, so much of the forfeited Lands in the County of Lowth in the Province of Leinster, (except the Barony of Atherdee) you are to set apart for satisfaction of the said Adventurers; And if the said forfeited Lands shall fall short of satisfying the said Adventurers, you are then to add the forfeited Lands undis∣posed by Our said Declaration, in the County of Catherlogh; And if those shall fall short; then the Lands remaining undis∣posed of in the County of Kildare, to supply all the said Adven∣turers deficiencies; And if those Lands fall short, then you are apart other forfeited Lands in some convenient place for the end aforesaid. And in order to the more particular apportioning or dividing the said Lands amongst the said Adventurers, and satisfying their deficiencies, & ascertaining their respective proportions, You are to cause publick Proclamation to be made within the
respective Counties, Cities, Baronies, and places in Ireland, thereby directing each Adventurer, his Assignee or Assignees, or his or their Agent or Agents, sufficiently authorized, that hath received any satisfaction in Land for his Adventure, with∣in forty dayes after such Proclamation, to deliver unto you in writing under his Hand and Seal a particular of the Houses, Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments possessed by him, to∣gether with the content or number of Acres both profitable and unprofitable, in each Town-Land, Village, Balybo, or Quar∣ter of Land, as the same were admeasured to him, or for his use, and in the Right of whom he claimeth such Adventure. And if such Adventure be for Houses in any city, such Adven∣turer is to deliver in, not onely the particular Houses, Tene∣ments and Hereditaments by him possessed, but also the va∣lue of them respectively, as set out to him, or any other for his use. And if any Adventurer, or the Assignee or Assignees of such Adventurers as aforesaid, shall neglect to return a Certificate as above-said, or shall wittingly make and deliver a false Certificate of the sums he was to be satisfied, according to the several Acts past in the Parliament begun at Westminster the third day of November, in the year of Our Lord One thou∣sand six hundred and Forty, and in the sixteenth Year of the Reign of Our Royal Father, entituled, An Act for the speedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in his Majesties Kingdom of Ireland, to their due obedience to his Majesty and the Crown of England; An Act for adding unto, and explaining of certain clauses in another Act made this Parliament, intituled, An Act for the speedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in his Maje∣sties Kingdom of Ireland, to their due obedience to his Majesty and the Crown of England; An Act for the further advancement of an effectual and speedy reduction of the Rebels in Ireland to the obedience of his Majesty and the Crown of England; An Act for a speedy Contribution and Loan towards the relief of his Majesties distressed Subjects of the Kingdom of Ireland; An Act to enable Corporations and Bodies Politick to participate of the benefit of an Act lately passed, intituled, An Act for the speedy and effectual reducing of the Rebels in his Majesties Kingdom of Ireland, to their due obedience to his Majesty and the Crown of England: Or shall neglect to return a Certificate as aforesaid, or wil∣lingly make and deliver a false Certificate of the Town-Lands, Villages, Balyboes, Quarters, or other Denominations of Land assigned or given out for satisfaction of the said Debt or Demand, or of the content or number of Acres, according as the same was set out to him or them, such Adventurer, or his Assignee shall forfeit for three years the Rents and Profits
that such Houses, Lands, Tenements, Hereditaments shall yeild, that he shall so omit to certifie, or that he shall not right∣ly certifie; such Forfeiture to be one Moyety to Vs, and the other to be for and towards the defraying the charges in exe∣cuting this Our Commission. Provided, a Discovery be made thereof before the three and twentieth of October One Thousand Six Hundred Sixty Three. That such of the said Adventurers and Souldiers as have taken Surveys of their Lands, do at or before the nine and twentieth day of September One thousand six hundred sixty two, bring in to you the said Surveys or Duplicates thereof, together with the Field-Books, (if in their possessions) the which you are carefully and exactly to compare with the Sur∣veys taken by Order of the late pretended Powers; And if you shall find any considerable difference between the said Sur∣veys, you are to ascertain such Adventurers and Souldiers possessions by such of the Surveys as shall appear most for Our advantage, and furtherance of this Service. Yet so, that if such Adventurer or Souldier shall think himself aggrie∣ved thereat, You shall appoint one or more sworn Surveyors to re-survey the said Lands in question, such Surveyor re∣turning his Field-Book to some other sworn Surveyor, to examine, cast up, and make up the same, such Adventurer or Souldier paying the said Surveyor for their said work, and in the mean such Adventurer and Souldier to be continued in possession according to the Survey which shall appear as aforesaid, most for Our Advantage: and if any one shall with∣out cause complain, and obtain a re-survey, he shall, as a pe∣nalty for so doing, forfeit so much land as he claims to want, and shall not be found wanting. And if any suggestion or in∣formation shall be made to the Lord Lieutenant, or other Chief Governour or Governours of Ireland for the time being, That profitable lands are held and possessed as unprofitable, the same shall be inquired of by a Iury, and such lands as were sur∣veyed and set out to Adventurers and Souldiers, or their Assigns, as unprofitable, and shall by such inquiry be found profitable, shall be re-assumed to supply Deficiencies, or make Reprisals. Out of which said Certificates and Sur∣veys, and by such other lawful ways and means as you shall think fit, you are to make up Books of what is due to each Adventurer, and to ascertain the possession of such to whom lands are assigned, therein expressing who was the former Proprietor who forfeited the same the three and twentieth of October One thousand six hundred forty one, or since; the Town-land, Village, Balyboe, Quarter, or other Denomina∣tion
of Land, the content, or number of Acres, the Parish, Barony, County and Province, in which such Lands do lye respectively; and where you shall find any Adventurer or his Assign to have more Lands than will satisfie his Adven∣ture, and that such Adventurer be in any other place deficient, or shall buy the Right of any deficient Adventurer, that such Over-plus Lands shall be assigned unto him towards satisfa∣ction of such deficiencies: and having brought things to this certainty, you are to set out Lands to the deficient Adventu∣rer in such way as shall be most indifferent and impartial, and pursuant to the Acts of Parliament. Whereas We have been graciously pleased to appoint the Forfeited Lands in the County of Kildare, for satisfaction of Incumbrances on the Estates of Adventurers and Souldi∣ers, according to Our said Declaration; in the satisfying thereof, you are to observe these following Directions, viz. To examine in the Books and Records of the late Court of Claims, or Exchequer, or other Courts, what Decrees or Iudgements were passed and allowed to be satisfied out of the Estates of the said Adventurers and Souldiers, the Adventurer and Souldier claiming satisfaction for such In∣cumbrance, shall make it appear that the said Decreed Lands are set out unto him as part of his lot, and he thereby Enti∣tuled to the Reprize for the said Incumbrance. If such Incum∣brance be by Mortgage, Statute Staple, Iudgement, Re∣cognizance, or of any sum of Money on the payment whereof the Land so Incumbred is to be free and discharged, you are then to set out Lands in the said County of Kildare, for satis∣faction of the said Incumbrance after the rate of Ten years purchase to be ascertained by inquiry, in way and manner, as is hereafter directed for the Reprize of such Adventurers and Souldiers as shall be removed from off their present Estates, or according to such other particular Directions, as you shall receive herein from Vs, or from Our Chief Governour or Go∣vernours and Council of that Our Kingdome for the time be∣ing, agreable to Our said Declaration: If such Incum∣brance be a Rent-charge or Yearly Rent, issuing or payable out of the Estates of the said Adventurers or Souldiers for e∣ver, or for years, or for life, You are then to put a Rate or Value on such Rent-charge, not exceeding Ten years Pur∣chase, for an Estate for ever, or Six years Purchase if for life, or for any term under Ten years, or Seven years Purchase if for Two lives, or any term above Ten years and under Twenty one years, or Eight years purchase for any term a∣bove Twenty one years, and under Thirty one years, and Nine years Purchase for all above Thirty one years, which
shall be satisfied out of the said Forfeited lands in the said County of Kildare, after the Rate afore-going. If such In∣cumbrance be by Lease or Leases for term of years, or for life or lives, you shall, as is before directed, inquire after the da∣mage such Adventurer or Souldier sustains by virtue of such Lease; and if the said term shall not exceed seven years, or the damage be not one third part of the full value of the said Lands set out to him, you shall not assign any recompence or Reprize; but if such damage be for above Seven years, or above one third part of the profits of such Estate, satisfaction is to be given in way and manner as in the preceding In∣structions is directed: The which Lands being thus set out, allotted and distributed to the said Adventurers, and Reprized to the said Adventurers and Souldiers, you are to give unto them respectively a Certificate of what Lands are so set out unto them, with the number of acres, Denominations of the said Lands, the Parish, Barony and County such Lands are in, and who Forfeited the same; which Certificate the said Adventurers & Souldiers are forthwith to Record in Our Court of Exchequer, upon which Our said Court is to give Order to Our respective Sheriffs to put the said Adventurers and Souldiers, their Assigns or Agents, into the possession of such Lands so allotted, divided, and set out, or reprized, as aforesaid. Whereas by Our said Declaration the Estates of every per∣son or persons that sate as Iudges in the pretended High Court of Iustice, upon the Life of Our Royal Father of bles∣sed Memory, or who Sentenced him, or who Signed or Sea∣led the Warrant for Execution, or who were of the Guard of Halberteers, assisting to put the Bloody Sentence of Death in execution upon the Thirtieth of January, One thousand Six hundred Forty eight, are not confirmed: You are therefore to inquire what Estates any of the said persons had, and to return Certificates thereof into Our Court of Exche∣quer, which Court is hereby required to sieze the same to Our use, and for the increase of Our Revenue, except so much of the same lands, Tenements and Hereditaments lately be∣longing to John Cook, as by Our Letters of the Twenty fourth of November last was granted by Vs to Sir George Lane Knight, for his faithful Service, which it is Our will and pleasure shall be confirmed to him, his Heirs and As∣signs accordingly; and that all proceedings necessary for the finding Our Title thereunto, and to the lands, Tenements and Hereditaments of Philip Hoare of Kilsalchan in the same letter to the said Sir George Lane granted, be speedily made by Our Officers and Ministers intrusted in that behalf, and
that thereupon letters Patents be past thereof, or of any o∣ther Forfeited Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments gi∣ven or granted by Our said letters in lieu thereof under Our Great Seal of Ireland; to the said Sir George Lane, his Heirs and Assignes, according to the direction of Our said letters, in the most large, favourable, and benigne accepta∣tion thereof. You are by the best way and means you can to in∣quire after all Forged Debentures, or Bills on which any lands have been set out, either to Adventurers or Souldiers, and forthwith certifie such Forgeries into Our Court of Ex∣chequer, that such persons may be proceeded against according to law: The like you are to do after the E∣states of such as have procured or obtained the possession of any Estate by Perjury, Bribery, or Subornation of Witnesses, or false, or undue admeasurement to Our prejudice, To the end such Estate or Estates so unjustly obtained may be seized, according to the Tenor of Our said Declaration. And whereas many being conscious of their own guilt or e∣vil intentions, with respect to the most heinous Rebellion begun the Three and Twentieth of October, One thousand Six hundred Forty and One, have made private Settlements of their Estates, and many of Our Protestant Subjects ha∣ving formerly Mortgaged their Houses, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, unto such as have Forfeited the same in these evil and unsetled Times, have notwithstanding entred upon and keep possession of Our Right, You are therefore in the best way and manner you can to make a Discovery of all such or any other concealments to Our prejudice; In Order whereunto, Our Officers in Our Four Courts of Dublin, or in the Office for Probat of Wills, are required to be aiding and assisting to you herein, and from time to time to search after such matters or things as you shall judge for Our Ser∣vice, to inquire after and to attend you with such Records as you shall judge needful. Whereas by Our said Declaration several innocent Pro∣testants and Papists are to be restored to their Estates, and a Reprize of equal value, worth and purchase is to be assigned to such Adventurers and Souldiers, and other persons as do possesse the same; in the doing thereof, you are to observe these following directions, viz. Not to restore any as an innocent Papist, that at, or before the Cessation, which was made upon the Fifteenth day of Sep∣tember, One thousand Six hundred Forty and three, were of the Rebels party, nor any who being of ful Age and sound Memory, enjoyed their Estates Real or Personal, in the Re∣bells Quarters: Provided that where any Citizen or In∣habitant
of the City of Cork, or of the Town of Youghal, or a∣ny other person or persons were not permitted to live in the English Quarters, but were expelled from thence, and driven into the Quarters of the Rebels, that than and in such case such inhabiting in those Quarters, and there receiving any benefit of their Estates, shall not be construed or adjudged any bar or impeachment of their Innocence; nor such as entred into the Roman-Catholick Confederacy, at any time before the Articles of Peace concluded, One thousand Six hundred Forty and eight; nor such as at any time adhered to the Nun∣cioes, or Clergies party, or Papal power, in opposition to the Kings Authority; nor such as have been Excommunicated for adhering to the Kings Authority, and afterwards owned their Offences for so doing, and were relaxed thereupon from their Excommunication; nor such who derived their Titles to their Estates from any who dyed guilty of any the aforemen∣tioned Crimes, nor such as pleaded the Articles of Peace for their Estates, nor such as being in the Quarters which were under the authority of Our Royal Father, or Our Self held correspondency with, or gave Intelligence to such as were then in opposition against Our said Royal Father, or Our Self in Ireland; nor such as before any of the Peaces in One thousand Six hundred Forty and six, or One thousand Six hundred Forty and Eight sate in any of the Confederate Roman-Catho∣lick Assemblies or Councils, or acted upon any Commissions or Powers derived from them, or any of them; nor such as im∣powered Agents or Commissioners to treat with any Forreign Papal power beyond Seas, for bringing into Ireland Forreign Forces, or were persons which acted in such Negotiations; nor such persons as have been Wood-kernes or Tories before the Marquess of Clanrickards leaving the Government of that Kingdome. You are to take care that the Adventurers and Souldiers in the Possessions of the Estates of any innocent Protestant or Papist restored to his said Estate by Our said Declaration, be forthwith Reprized as in Our said Declaration is directed, therein observing the signification of Our pleasure in Our said Declaration, for the Reprizing such as shall be removed from the Estates of innocent Protestants or Papists at the time they shall be so removed. In the next place you are to take care, That the Adventu∣rers, Souldiers, or other persons possessed of any of the E∣state or Estates of such persons, to whom we have by Our said Declaration assigned a particular favour, and are in a distinct Branch thereof by name expressed, be Reprized as in Our said Declaration is directed; and the said persons re∣stored
to their former Estates from the time that such Adven∣turers or Souldiers shall be so Reprized; observing alwayes the further cautions and provisions in Our said Declaration expressed, referring to the said persons restauration: If any who by Our said Declaration are to be restored to their former Estates, have or shall without Order molest, disturb, or un∣quiet any of the Adventurers, Souldiers, or other persons in the possession of their respective Estates, or for the mean profits thereof contrary to what is directed and provided for in Our said Declaration, such person or persons untill they shall surcease such disturbance, or having taken possession, shall re∣deliver the same to the person so dispossessed, and account and satisfie unto him the Damages sustained thereby, shall have no benefit of the Grace and Favour held forth by Our said De∣claration to him or them respectively: And in case any per∣son or persons that hath so disturbed or dispossessed any Adven∣turer or Souldier, or their Assigns of any Houses, Lands or Tenements, formerly Assigned for Adventurers or Arrears, and by such Adventurers or Souldiers quietly enjoyed shall not as aforesaid quietly resign the possession of such Lands to such Adventurers or Souldiers, or their Assigns: That you do then forthwith give Order to Our respective Sheriffs to put such Adventurers, Souldiers, or their As∣signs into quiet possession of such Estates, which Orders of yours Our said respective Sheriffs are hereby required strictly to observe accordingly. Provided nevertheless, That where such person or persons so dispossessed and to be restored to his or their former estates by the next preceding instruction, shall be contented to submit to a reprize; that in such cases you are forthwith to set out lands in some convenient place for the Reprizing him or them accor∣dingly; You are to take care that all that by Our said Decla∣ration are to be restored to their former Estates, do before such restauration to their said Estates, under their Hands and Seals exhibit unto you the ground upon which he or they claim the benefit of Our said Declaration, and a particular of their respective Estates; in which, you are to take care that they claim no other Lands than what did rightfully belong to them, and was in their Real possession the Two and Twen∣tieth day of October, One thousand Six hundred Forty and one. And if any one so to be restored shall make a claim that he or they are not Entituled unto, or make and deliver unto you a false particular of his said Estate, and therein include other Lands than what he or they so Entituled unto and possessed of as aforesaid, or having to any Irish Papist or person
excepted from confirmation of his Estate in Our said Declara∣tion, Morgaged or otherwise incumbred his or their said E∣states, either before the said Two and twentieth of October, One thousand Six hundred Forty and one, or since that day, or have sold the same to any such Irish Papist or excepted person, and shall not particularly express the same in the said parti∣cular so to be delivered; in all such cases, such person or persons offending herein, for such offence shall forfeit the full value of the Land so endeavoured to be gained out of any other Lands to be restored to him by vertue of Our said Declaration: You are forthwith to Reprize such Adventurers, Souldiers, and other persons, who are now in the possession of the Estate of the Earl of Clancarty; As also to satisfie Erasmus Smith Esq his deficiency, as an Adventurer in some convenient Forfeit∣ed Lands in the County of Lowth, that he may be better ina∣bled and incouraged to answer those publick pious Vses in in∣corporating Five Free-Schools within that Our Kingdome, for which he hath petitioned for Our License, and to Reprize him the said Erasmus Smith such Lands now or lately in his possessi∣on that are restored or restorable to the former Proprietors: And to accept from Peter Wallis Esq a surrender of the great Island near Ross in the County of Wexford, and Reprise him the same in the County of Cork on the Lands now in the said Peter Wallis his possession, not exceeding the yearly value of what the said Island may be set for. And to the end you may the more readily proceed in Repri∣zing such as in Our said Declaration are to be Reprized, be∣ing to be removed from off the Estate of any person or per∣sons to be restored to their former Estates, you are forthwith to make up Books of all the Forfeited undisposed Lands in Ire∣land, and not before Assigned for satisfaction of the deficient Adventurers, or Reprizing the Adventurers and Souldiers, the Incumbrances on their Estates, in which you are careful∣ly to set down all the Forfeited Lands in the County of Cather∣lagh by themselves, and all the Forfeited Lands in the Baro∣nies of Barrimore and Muskry by themselves; the one being ap∣ppinted for the Reprizal of such as are removed from ost the Estate of James Lord Marquess of Ormond, Lord Steward of Our Houshold, and the other to satisfie Decrees of the innocent Papists inhabitants of Cork, Youghal, and Kingsale; In the doing whereof, you are to appoint what quarter or point of the said County of Catherlagh, and the said Baronies of Bar∣rimore and Muskry to begin withal, and accordingly to make up the said Book or Catalogue of the said Lands, by way of contiguity, with as much indifferency and impartiality as may be.
And to the end the said Adventurers and Souldiers so to be removed, may be reprised with all indifferency, as in Our said Declaration is directed; Where We appoint not a parti∣cular Reprize, You shall forthwith nominate and appoint fit and indifferent persons in each Corporation, County, and Place in Ireland, where any of the said Estates are, to exa∣mine upon Oath, and by all other good Wayes and Means, the value of such Estates, and the Improvements made there∣on, and to return a Certificate thereof under their hands and seals to you accordingly, in due form, therein distinguishing the Value of such Estate from the Improvements made there∣on by the said persons to be removed, The same to be return∣ed unto You by a short time to be by You limited, upon re∣turn whereof you are by like Wayes and Means to inquire of the Value of some other Forfeited Lands, not already disposed of, and forthwith assigne the same to such Adventurers, Soul∣diers, or other persons so to be removed, as in Our said De∣claration is expressed, taking care to reserve the Forfeited lands in the County of Dublin, till all other Forfeited Lands be disposed of, unless we shall otherwise direct, to the end such of the Inhabitants of any Corporation as have been remo∣ved for security, may be Reprized as far as Our Declaration provides for his or their Estates in such Corporation, in some convenient place near such Corporations. You are to take care that the undisposed Forfeited Lands near such Corporations, be preserved to reprize such Inhabi∣tants, except the Lands near Cork, Youghal and Kinsale, for which Lands are assigned as aforesaid. You are to prepare an exact List of the respective Adventu∣rers, Souldiers, and others removed from off the Estate of James Lord Marquess of Ormond, Lord Steward of Our Houshold, by themselves; And another of such of the Inha∣bitants of the said Town of Cork, Youghal and Kinsale, whose Decrees for Lands are by Our said Declaration to be satis∣fied, and to appoint how the said Adventurers, Souldiers, or other persons and Inhabitants aforesaid, shall be reprized re∣spectively; and accordingly so much of the Lands in the said County of Catherlagh as will suffice, shall be set out to the said Adventurers and souldiers removed from off the Lord Marquess of Ormonds Estate, as aforesaid; and so much in like manner of the said Baronies of Barrimore and Muskry as will suffice, set out to the Inhabitants aforesaid. Whereas We have been graciously pleased to make provision for the Satisfaction of the Personal Arrears of such Prote∣stant Officers who served in Our Kingdom of Ireland at any time from the three and twentieth of October One thousand
six hundred forty & one, as by the partiality of the Times have received no satisfaction for their Service before the Fifth of June One thousand Six Hundred Forty Nine, and for the stating the Arrears of such of them as have not had their Ar∣rears stated, as in Our Declaration of the Thirtieth of No∣vember One Thousand Six Hundred and Sixty, is provided for. You, or any five or more of you, as aforesaid, are there∣fore to observe and follow therein these Instructions follow∣ing: Viz. You shall state the Accompts or Arrears of such Commissi∣oned Officers, or their Assigns, as are not stated, for their own Personal Service in Ireland: During the time of their Service, every such Commissioned Officer whose Accompts You shall so state, shall evidence his being an Officer, and his Quality, either by his Commission or Commissions, or by Muster-Rolls, or by the Certificates of two or more Commis∣sioned Officers, whereof one to be a Field-Officer, such Cer∣tificate to be under the Hands and Seals of such Officers. Every such Officer whose Accompts You shall state, shall exhibit unto You, under his own Hand and Seal, the State of his own Accompt, therein expressing the time of his Service, the money or pay received, the Regiment, Troop, Company, or Garison, or Service in which he served, and what he de∣mands, as due to him for his said Service. If any Officer shall knowingly produce a false or counterfeit Certificate, thereby attempting to mis-guide You in the sta∣ting his Arrears, such person producing such false Certificate, and also the person giving the same, shall forfeit their respe∣ctive Arrears, and all Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments to be set out to such Officer for his Arrears. You shall allow the Accompts of such Officers but according to their Commissions and Establishment of Pay allowed by Our Royal Father, or by both Houses of the Parliament at Westminster, begun in the Sixteenth year of Our late Royal Fathers Reign: For which Accompts, or Arrears so stated. You are to give unto every such Officer, or his Assigns, one or more Debentures under Your Hands and Seals, for the re∣spective sums that shall be due to him or them, to be satisfied out of the Securities appointed by Our said Declaration, for such Officers aforesaid, that served in Ireland within the time aforesaid. If any Obstruction or Difficulty shall happen in stating the Accompts of the said Officers, not hereby provided against, You are from time to time in all such cases to certifie the same to our Chief Governour or Governours for the time being, and our Privy Council in Ireland, who are hereby authorized
to set down, and in Writing give unto you such further Rules and Directions therein, as to them shall seem meet, the which you are hereby required to observe. In order to the ascertaining the Rents, as well payable by the Adventurers as by the Officers and Souldiers now or late of the Army in Ireland, toward the present satisfaction of Arrears and other Vses in Our said Declaration expressed, You shall nominate and appoint fit persons to be imployed in the respective Counties, Baronies, Cities and places in Ire∣land, where any Houses, Lands Tenements or Heredita∣ments are already disposed of, either to Adventurers or Soul∣diers, or other persons, with fitting instructions unto them to prepare a particular and distinct Rent-Roll of what the same did yield above all Reprizes for the year One thousand six hundred Fifty nine, the which within a certain time to be li∣mited and appointed, are to be returned unto you: And if any mistake shall happen to be in the said Rent-Roll so retur∣ned, you are to amend the same in such way and manner as shall be just, therein distinguishing the Houses, Lands, Te∣nements and Hereditaments set out to the Adventurers from those set out to Souldiers, and those of the Souldiers now of Our Army in Ireland, or disbanded in the year One thou∣sand Six hundred Fifty three, from those Souldiers for∣merly of the Army in Ireland, who received satisfaction for their Arrears in the years One thousand Six hundred Fifty five, One thousand Six hundred Fifty six, One thousand six hundred and Fifty seven, which Rent-Rolls are fairly to be ingrossed. And in case Our chief Governour or Governours for the time being in Ireland, shall judge it for Our Service, he or they shall Order the issuing forth Commissions under Our Great Seal of that our Kingdom of Ireland, for the ends and to the persons so to be nominated and appointed as afore∣said, That in order to the discovering the full value of the premisses, every such Adventurer, Officer or Souldier, or other person, the confirmation of whose Estates, is held forth by Our said Declaration, shall within Forty dayes after pub∣lick notice by you to be given, deliver in Writing under his Hand and Seal to the persons to be imployed in the respective Counties, Baronies, Cities and Places, a particular of their Estates, with the respective Names of their Tenants, and the Rents they were to pay in the said year One thou∣sand Six hundred Fifty nine; and the respective Tenants to every such adventurer, Souldier, or other person, shall also deliver to the said persons a particular of the Lands and Te∣nements held by them, with the Names of the Land-lords,
and the Rent they were to pay for the said year One Thousand Six hundred Fifty Nine. That if any adventurer, Officer or Souldier, or other persons so returning the Value and Profits of his said Estate, shall fail to return the full value thereof, or any part thereof, that for such Offence, he shall forfeit half a years Rent of the Estate so concealed, one fourth part to the person discovering the same, and the other three parts towards the Relief and Support of such as have suffered for Our Royal Father, or Our self; And for the better Discovery of the Truth in the premisses, Our Chancellour of Ireland for the time being, is hereby authorized and required to issue forth Commissions from time to time, as occasion shall require, to impower and Autho∣rize you, or such as shall be by the Chief Governour or Gover∣nours of that Our Kingdom for the time being, and Our Council there nominated thereunto in the respective Counties, Baronies, Cities and Places, as aforesaid, to administer an Oath or Oaths, as often as it shall be needful. And You, and such as shall be imployed as aforesaid shall, as often as occasion shall require, send for Persons, Leases, Pa∣pers and Records that any way tend to the Discovery of the full Value of the said Estates, or any other matter or thing hereby committed to your trust, and then you are to return Duplicates fairly ingrossed under your hands and Seals, or the Hands and Seals of the major part of you, of the aforesaid Rents, and to such persons as we shall nominate to be the Receivers of the several Rents and sums of mony payable by Our said Declaration, and also to Our said Vice-Treasurer and Receiver General. You are also to prepare a particular of all the Forfeited Houses, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments within the Counties of Wicklow, Longford, Leitrim and Donegal, as al∣so of the forfeited Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments not already disposed of, in the Province of Connought and County of Clare, lying and being within a Mile of the River of Shan∣non, or of the Sea, commonly called the Mile-Line, and with∣in any Corporation in Ireland (except as in Our said Declara∣tion is excepted) and by Inquest or other lawful means put a reasonable and just value on all and every the said Houses, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, first deducting what shall be made appear to have been laid out by any Person on Leases or Contracts for Leases in any Corporation, in build∣ing or improving Houses, or in planting Orchards, or Gar∣dens, all which said Improvements shall be ascertained in a moderate way, either by the Surveys formerly taken of them, or that shall hereafter be taken, where you shall see cause to ap∣point the same.
That you do with all possible speed prepare an Accompt of the Personal Arrears of such Officers or their Assigns, ser∣ving before the said Fifth day of June One Thousand Six Hundred Forty Nine, and who have not received any lands or moneys in satisfaction for their Arrears, before or since the said Fifth day of June One thousand Six Hundred Forty Nine, as also an Estimate of the respective Securities appoint∣ed by our said Declaration for satisfying the said Arrears. In Order whereunto, you are to value the Houses, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments at eight years purchase, de∣ducting the value of such Improvements as shall appear, as a∣foresaid, to have been made on Houses, Orchards, or Gardens; And if by the said Estimate you shall find the said Security will not extend to satisfie twelve shillings & six pence in every pound of the said arrears, you are to proportion the said satisfaction ac∣cording to the said Security with equality & indifferencie; You shall then expose all such Houses, Lands, Tenements and Here∣ditaments to sale, first giving publick notice of the time & place of such sale, to the end that all persons concerned may give their attendance; In which sale, You are to make special provision that such Officer or Officers, or their Assignes, who shall so purchase any of the said Houses, Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments within any Corporation, do enter Security before you grant to him or them any Certificate, as is hereaf∣ter directed, to satisfie such as by vertue of any Lease or Con∣tract for Lease, have built or improved any house, or planted a∣ny Orchard or Garden, either in money, or else by granting un∣to such person or persons a Lease or Leases of the premisses at a Rent proportionable to the said Improvements; and that if any Controversie shall happen therein, the same shall be deter∣mined by You, or such as the Chief Governour or Governours of that Our Kingdom for the time being, and Our Council there shall appoint upon the place, to hear and determine the same. You are to sell all the said Houses, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments publikly, and at the time and place appointed to such person or persons who will give most for the same, which being sold, You shall forthwith enter such Sales in Books for that purpose to be prepared and provided. Nevertheless that no such sale shall be good or allowed, where the purchase shall not amount unto eight years purchase, or upwards, according to the Rates set by you on such Houses, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, Deductions or Allowance being made for the improvements as aforesaid. Provided alwayes, that there be for every Twenty Shil∣lings that such House, Orchard, or Garden-plot is worth, to be
let, Eighteeen pence yearly reserved to Vs, Our Heirs and Successours for ever; And you are to return Duplicates of Our said Books to Our Vice-Treasurer and Receiver-Gene∣ral: You are to take care that all such Officers who shall purchase any of the said Houses, Lands, Tenements or He∣reditaments, do within Fourteen dayes after the Contract or Bargain for the same, deliver up unto you so many Deben∣tures as such Purchase doth amount unto, which Debentures you shall cancel; and if any thing remain above the Pur∣chase-Money, give unto them others for the remaining part not satisfied, the which Debentures so delivered upon the said Purchase, shall at the making of the Contract be fairly entred in books for that purpose to be kept: And if any such Pur∣chaser or Purchasers shall fail so to deliver up Debentures according to his Purchase as aforesaid, such Sale or Purchase shall not be good or allowed unto such Purchaser or Purcha∣sers, nor such Officers Debentures admitted in any other Purchase. Provided alwayes, That where any Purchaser shall pur∣chase with Money, he shall pay down one fifth part of the Money at the making the said Contract, and the remaining part within Eight and twenty dayes; and failing of the said payment within Eight and twenty dayes, he shall forfeit the said Fifth part paid, and the Purchase shall be void; and the Money so paid in Purchase shall be towards satisfaction of the Arrears of the said Officers: The said Purchase being fully perfected in manner as aforesaid, you are to give unto such purchaser or purchasers, a Certificate of the particulars thereof, which Certificate such persons shall forthwith Record in Our Surveyor Generals Office, whereupon Our Court of Exchequer shall forthwith grant an Order for the quiet posses∣sion of the Premisses. For your more full information, as well of the particulars aforesaid, as in the Value, Worth, Quan∣tity, Quality, Scituation of such Houses, Lands, Tene∣ments and Hereditaments so to be sold, you are to have re∣course to the Surveyes taken of them; and where you shall suspect such Surveys faulty, you are to appoint fit persons to Re-survey and Certifie the same unto you. Whereas the Corporation of Bandon-Bridge having former∣ly issued several sums of Money and Provisions, for the Pay and Support of the Army in Ireland, to whom in considerati∣on of the said Moneys and Provisions, Lands have been as∣signed and set out, upon the Receipt of which Lands they have delivered up their Vouchers, you are therefore to exa∣mine what Lands have been assigned and set out to them, and to settle so much thereof upon the said Corporation as shall a∣mount
unto the clear yearly value of One hundred pound by the year: You are also to take care that the Lands set out to Susanna Bastick and her Children be accordingly confirmed to them. And whereas We have by Our said Declaration assigned the benefit arising from the Redemption of Mortgages, Sta∣tute Staples, and Iudgements, where the Lands are not al∣ready disposed of to Adventurers or Souldiers, for and to¦wards the satisfaction of such Officers who received no satis∣faction for their Arrears before the Fifth day of June One thou∣sand Six hundred Forty nine, you are therein to observe these following Directions: You are to have recourse to the Records of the late Court of Claimes and Our Court of Exchequer, or other Courts, the better to ascertain your knowledge what Lands were so in∣cumbred; as also, if you shall see cause, you are to make in∣quiry in all places within Our Kingdom of Ireland, for the Discovery of such Mortgages, Statute Staples, Iudgments, and other Incumbrances: And after such particular know∣ledge of the premises obtained on the remaining term, you are to make a just Estimate according to the Rates currant of what the Fee-simple of such Lands, Tenements and Heredi∣taments, lying under the said Incumbrances are worth, al∣wayes deducting the Moneys to be paid in order to discharge the said Incumbrance, and the same particularly and distinct∣ly to enter into one or more Books fitted for that purpose; and if the person Entituled to the Incumbrance will pay what the Land amounts to in value above the Moneys payable in dis∣charge of the said Incumbrance, then such person is to have the absolute Estate of the said Lands legally setled to him and his Heirs; But if such person shall refuse to pay the said O∣ver-plus, then if any Officer interested in the said Security, will purchase any part thereof, he shall after discharge of the Incumbrance out of the common Stock of the said Security enjoy the same as far as his Debenture, or so much thereof as he shall place thereupon shall reach: And for such part of the benefit arising out of such Incumbred Lands, which shall not be purchased by any Officer as aforesaid, it shall be put to Sale, and the Moneyes by such Sales shall be for the satisfa∣ction, as is in Our Declaration expressed. And whereas We have assigned a years Rent, and a year and a halfs Rent payable by the Souldiery in Ireland, to∣wards the satisfaction of such as in our said Declaration are expressed; you are therefore to take care that the said Moneys and Rents be paid unto such persons as We shall particularly appoint to receive the same, who are hereby Authorized and
impowered from time to time by Proclamation or otherwise, to cause publick notice to be given to the respective Adventurers, Souldiers, and others, who are to pay the said moneys of the manner & place for payment thereof; And if any Adventurer, Souldier or other person shall refuse or neglect to pay his or their moneys in way or manner, and at the place so to be ap∣pointed; the Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments of such person so failing, shall be seized into Our Hands, and so con∣tinue for Security and Satisfaction of the said several Rents. And the said Souldiers are to pay the said moneys unto such persons as We shall appoint to collect and receive the same, who are to pay over the same unto Our Right Trusty and well Beloved Cousin and Councellour Arthur Lord Viscount Valentia, Our Vice-Treasurer of that Our Kingdom, who is hereby required to issue forth the same according to such Warrants or Orders as he shall from time to time receive from any five or more of You, as aforesaid, for and towards the Satisfaction of the aforesaid Arrears: And to the end Our said Vice-Treasurer may know what sums of Money he is to receive, all Acquittances given by those appointed to collect and receive as aforesaid, are to be entered and signed by the several Officers of the Exchequer in the accustomed man∣ner for Acquittances. You are also from time to time to take a perfect Accompt from such persons so to be imployed, of all the particular Re∣ceipts & payments relating to the premisses, which Accompts so taken are to be kept in a fair Book, and returned into Our Court of Exchequer, that so they may be ready to be produced for the Satisfaction of such as may be concerned there∣in. Before you admit any Deventure of any Officer who hath Arrears satisfied since June, One Thousand Six Hundred Forty Nine, You shall satisfie such whose Arrears You shall state, and such whose arrears are stated, and have not received Satisfaction for their Service before or since June, One Thou∣sand Six Hundred Forty Nine, twelve Shillings and six Pence in every Pound of their said arrears, and then out of the remaining Security, as far as it will extend, you are to satis∣fie the remaining part of the arrears of such as hereby are to receive twelve Shillings and six pence in the pound, as also the arrears due before One Thousand Six Hundred Forty Nine, of such who have received satisfaction for their arrears due since One Thousand Six Hundred Forty Nine; and this to be done without any Priority or Distinction in an equal pro∣portion; after that you have first made up the Deficiency of those who have been satisfied in part since One Thousand Six
Hundred Forty Nine, but have not yet Lands set out to them to the full of that proportion which they were to have had at the time when the rest of the Lands were set out unto them and others as aforesaid: We having by Our said Declaration as∣signed the Forfeited Houses, Lands, Tenements and Heredi∣taments, not already disposed of, within any Corporation in Ireland, or in the Counties of Wicklow, Longford, Leitrim and Donegal, and within a mile of the River Shannon, com∣monly called or known by the name of Mile-Line, for satisfa∣ction of such Officers who served Our Royal Father, or Our Self in Ireland, before the Fifth of June, One Thousand Six Hundred Forty Nine, as in Our Declaration is directed. In Order thereunto Our Court of Exchequer in Ireland is hereby authorized and required to put the premisses out of Charge from the Three and Twentieth of October, last past, without Fee or other Charge for the same. And towards the carrying on the work hereby appointed, and all the contingent Charges thereof, the moneys received by Major William Cadowgan, and others, for the Rents of the Counties of Wicklow, Leitrim, Longford and Donegal, and for the Lands in Connaught and Clare, commonly known or called by the name of Mile-Line, for several years last past, shall be paid into the Hands of such persons as we shall, as a∣foresaid, appoint to receive the moneys payable by the Adven∣turers or Souldiers, and the accompts thereof forthwith de∣livered unto you: The which accompts you are hereby requi∣red to Audit and Examine. All the Rents and Profits of the Houses, Lands, Tene∣ments and Hereditaments by Our said Declaration appoint∣ed for Satisfaction of the said Officers before the Fifth of June, One Thousand Six Hundred Forty Nine, until the same be sold, as is before directed, shall be paid into the Hands of such persons as we shall appoint as aforesaid, to collect and receive the same, for the Ends and Vses above mentioned, as also towards the Satisfaction of such persons as are to receive Satisfaction for their Improvements in building or repair∣ing Houses, planting Orchards or Gardens: All which said moneys shall be paid by Warrant from You, or any five or more of you aforesaid, directed to Our said Vice-Treasurer, for the Ends and Vses aforesaid. Whereas several Lands have been set out for satisfaction of Money lent, or publick Debts incurred for Provisions, Arms and Ammunition, furnished before the year One thou∣sand Six hundred Forty four, the which Lands so set out We have by Our said Declaration reserved for that purpose; and to the end the persons to whom the said Lands are so set
out may receive satisfaction for their said Moneys and Provi∣sions, according to the Tenor of Our said Declaration, you are to compute the Money that ought to have been paid for the said Provision, Arms and Ammunition, together with the In∣terest for the same, unto the time the said Lands were set out, after the rate of 6. pounds per centum per annum: You shall in∣quire of the Value of the said Lands what improvements there are made since they were set out, what worth to be sold when set out at the rate of Ten years purchase, and who now in possession, and under what Title. You shall assign so much of the said Lands so set out, as ac∣cording to Ten years purchase, the aforesaid Money for the said provision, &c. with the Interest thereof as aforesaid will amount unto, first deducting the Improvements made on the premisses since they were set out as aforesaid. And whereas James Duke of Ormond, Lord Steward of Our Household, together with Sir Philip Percivall and Sir George Lane Knights, and also others at the instance and re∣quest of the said Duke of Ormond, became bound for certain Moneys lent, and publick Debts incurred for Provision, Arms and Amunition, and furnished and delivered in Provisions and other Necessaries, in Order to the carrying on of the War in that Our Kingdom, whereby they have made themselves, their Heirs, Executors and Administrators, ly∣able to Suit, Hazard and Loss, if not provided for, and sa∣tisfaction set out for the same, which in all equity ought to be done, you are therefore required forthwith to set out Forfeited Lands in the Counties of Kildare and Dublin, or one of them, for satisfaction of the said Debts, Provisions, and other ne∣cessaries, according to the last fore-going Rules; and that in the mean time neither the said Duke of Ormond, nor any other bound for the said Debts at his instance and request, their Heirs, Executors, or Admistrators, be sued, molested, or troubled for, or concerning the same; And if any of the said Lands already set, or which shall be set out be restored to for∣mer Proprietors, you are forthwith to assign other Lands of equal Value, Worth and Purchase in lieu thereof: You are likewise after the same rate of Ten years purchase to assign & set out some convenient Forfeited lands unto Major George Rayden, in satisfaction of Debentures for Arrears and Mo∣neys paid by him for Provisions furnished as aforesaid, and for which no satisfaction as yet hath been assigned, as also to Do∣ctor William Petty, for his deficient Debentures according to the direction of Our Letter of the Second of January, One thousand Six hundred and sixty. Whereas there is a Rent payable to Vs out of every Acre
of Land assigned, or to be assigned to any Adventurer, Soul∣dier, or other person, as by Our Declaration appears in order to the ascertaining thereof, you are to observe these following directions, viz. Where there is no certain Record of the Lands assigned or set out to the Souldiers or other persons, so that the Rent pay∣able to Vs cannot be ascertained; in all such cases you are to cause Proclamation to be made, and Certificates to be re∣turned of all such respective Possessions, Debentures and Debts for which the said Lands were set out to them in way and manner, as by Our aforesaid Instructions is directed, with respect unto the Method to be observed concerning the Lands assigned unto the Adventurers, wherein you are ex∣presly to distinguish betwixt what Lands are set out for satis∣faction of Arrears grown due in England, from what is set out for satisfaction of Arrears grown due in Ireland; you are out of the said Certificates and out of the Surveys and Books of Debentures, or Books of Distributions or Subdivisions of Lands to any Office or place in Ireland, forthwith to cause fair Books to be made up, of all the Houses, Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, set out to the Adventurers, Souldiers, and other persons whose Estates are confirmed by Our said Declaration, together with the Rents and Profits payable unto Vs according to Our said Declaration by such Adventu∣rers, Souldiers and others: And you are carefully and exactly to reduce the measure of such Lands as were set out by Plantation-measure, of Twenty one Foot to the Pearch, and One hundred and Sixty Pearches to the Acre, to Sixteen Foot and an half to the Pearch, and One hundred and Sixty Pearches to the Acre, and accordingly to ascertain the Rent payable to Vs, the which you are likewise to do of all the E∣states we are graciously pleased to restore unto any Papist, whose Estates were formerly disposed of, or remained undispo∣sed of in Our Hands. Provided such Estates did not formerly pay unto Our Roy∣al Father a greater Rent, in which case the said greater Rent is to be reserved and paid to Vs for the Future; which Books so made up, you are to lodge as Our Court of Exche∣quer shall direct, with some Officer of Our Revenue, that the Rents may be given in Charge: And that no prejudice may be to Vs, or uncertainty in Our Revenue, You are also to prepare Duplicates of the said Books to be kept in the Office of Our Chief Remembrancer and Treasurers Remembran∣cer. And whereas in the Execution hereof it will be necessary to imploy several persons, for the inquiry into, and preparing
several matters hereby committed to your Trust, you are therefore hereby Authorized and Impowered from time to time to nominate and appoint such person or persons as you shall finde necessary for Our Service herein, unto whom Our Chancellor for the time being for that Our Kingdom, is here∣by required and authorized to grant One or more Commissions under Our Great Seal of that Our Kingdom for the purposes aforesaid. And whereas We have by Our said Declaration provided that Protestant Plantations shall be setled, Corporations created, Churches erected, Maintenance for Preaching Mi∣nisters provided, within the limits and precincts of the Lands to be setled on the Adventurers and Souldiers, the same being subject to many intricacies and of universal concernment to that Our Kingdome: We do therefore refer the whole consi∣deration thereof unto Our Parliament for their Advice therein. And you are hereby strictly required to take special care, that the Decrees and the Estates in Lands set out in satisfaction of the same in the Province of Connaught and County of Clare, to any Transplanted or Transplantable person, and purcha∣sed from them, or any of them, by Charles Earl of Mountrath, John Lord Baron of Kingstown, Richard Lord Coot Baron of Coloony, Carey Dillon Esq Sir George Bingham Baronet, Sir Oliver St. George Knight and Baronet, Sir John Cole Baronet, Sir James Shaen Knight, Major Arthur Gore, Sir George St. George, Sir James Cuffe, John Eyres Esquire, Henry Waddington Esq Captain Robert Parks, Captain Ro∣bert Morgan, and Captain Owen Lloyd, be confirmed unto them, and every of them, their Heirs and Assigns respective∣ly; they paying one full years Value of the Profits of such E∣states to Vs, Our Heirs and Successors, in two years space in such manner, and for such Vses as in Our late Declaration is offered to be contributed by the Adventurers and Souldi∣ers and accepted by Vs, and that they be not removed from a∣ny such Estates in Lands they have so purchased by virtue of such Decrees, untill they be duely reprized out of other Forfei∣ted Lands of equal Value, Worth and Purchase, in the said Province of Connaught or County of Clare, or elsewhere, as in Our said Declaration is directed for Adventurers and Souldiers. Provided that this shall not be construed to confirm the De∣cree of any person for so much thereof as was obtained by in∣justice, fraud, irregularity or oppression in the proceedings; but especially of any person who had no Right nor Title by the Rules given for making those Decrees to the Estate; in
compensation whereof such Decree was granted, if the same shall be made appear unto you before the Five and Twentieth day of March, One Thousand Six hundred Sixty and Three; And in such case it is Our pleasure that any of the aforesaid persons who hath purchased Lands upon any such insufficient Decree, shall or may place some other unsatisfied or reprizable Decree upon such Lands. Provided also, That this Clause shall not extend to confirm unto the said persons any Lands that are restorable by Our Declaration to the former Proprietors, Reprizals being given in lieu thereof, as in the Declaration is appointed. Provided also, That such Transplanted Persons who be∣ing within Rules of Reprizal have been removed from the Lands to which they have been transplanted without any Re∣prize therefore first given, be forthwith Reprized in the first place, and before all other Reprizable persons. And that the Lands set out unto Sir Thomas Herbert, and Benjamin Worsley Esq for their Salaries in Ireland, in relati∣on to their Imployments about the Satisfaction of the Soul∣diery in stating their Arrears, or surveying or setting out Lands, be confirmed unto them, and their Heirs and Assigns, severally and respectively. And if the said Lands, or any part thereof, shall be restored to the former Proprietors, That a Reprize be forthwith assigned and set out unto them, their Heirs and Assignes severally and respectively, in lieu thereof, in like manner as is provided for such Adventurers and Souldiers as shall be removed from off their present Estates. And whereas some Ambiguity or Doubt may arise under what Qualifications such persons may be comprehended, who submitted unto Our Articles of Peace, and inviolably obser∣ved the same, yet neither attended Vs in Forreign Parts, nor sued out Decrees for Lands in Connaught or County of Clare: You are in order to their Settlement to proceed in the same way and method, as by Our Declaration is held forth for those that submitted to Our Articles, and inviolably observed the same, and attended Vs in Forreign parts. And for the better quieting, setling and securing the seve∣ral persons, and their Interests for whom provision is made in Our said Declaration and Instructions, and this present Act, the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Deputy, Lords Iustices, or their Chief Governour or Governours of that Our Kingdom for the time being, upon Certificate signed by you, or any Five, or more of you as aforesaid, expressing the Name or Names of such persons, the quality of their Estates, the number of A∣cres, the Barony, County, and Province in which such E∣states
are, and the ents reservable; as also the Tenure and Services, are hereby authorized and required upon request by the person or persons so concerned, to cause effectual Let∣ters Patents under the Great Seal of that Our Kingdome, to be passed in the usual manner, of such Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments to the persons aforesaid, by advice of Our Learned Council in the Law, for that Our Kingdom, or some of them, as the case shall require, without expecting any fur∣ther Letters, or Warrants from Our Self, and for so doing these Our Directions shall be to them, and every of them their sufficient Warrant and Discharge. And whereas we, not apprehending that we should arrive at a Settlement of Our Kingdom of Ireland, so soon and with so general Satisfaction to all Interests, as we have done, did upon the petitions of several persons asserting their Innocence, grant Our Letters for the re-possessing such Petitioners of their former Estates, or any part thereof, which Letters may possibly not answer to Our said Declaration and Instructions, which now We look upon as the positive and fundamental Rule for the Settlement of that Our Kingdome, the Chief Governour and Governours of that Our Kingdom for the time being, and Our Privy Council there, are therefore in execu∣ting the contents of such Our Letters to observe the same as they shall fall under Our several Rules in Our said Declara∣tion, and agreeable to the same, and as in these Our Instru∣ctions are more particularly expressed, and not other∣wise. For your pains and labour herein, and for the pains and la∣bour of such Sub-Commissioners as you shall imploy as afore∣said, We do hereby authorize you to ask, demand and receive from every Adventurer, Souldier, or other persons, his or their Heirs or Assigns, now in possession, or to be put in pos∣session of any Houses, Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments, one penny for every Acre of land, as admeasured, assigned, or set out to him or them, for ascertaining their respective posses∣sions; and likewise for every one to be reprized an Estate worth Twenty Pounds per annum, the sum of Ten Shillings, and after the same Rate, for greater or smaller Reprizes, and for every Certificate for Lands to be possessed, the sum of Ten Shillings, and one penny in the pound for every Debenture that shall be satisfied by you, and for the Clerks and Officers to be imployed by you, and the contingent Charges relating thereunto, that the same be paid out of the moneys that shall be received of the Rents due and payable out of the Securities appointed for the Officers before One Thousand Six Hundred Forty and Nine.
In the ascertaining, stating and setling of any sum or sums of Money, Debentures, Certificates, or Decrees for Arrears, Adventures, publick Debts, Reprizes, or other allowed Interests pursuant unto Our said Declaration: You are to strike off and deduct all Fractions of odd Pounds, Shil∣lings, and Pence, and likewise in the ascertaining and setting out of the respective Proportions of Lands, which shall be set∣led or granted in satisfaction of any of the aforesaid Interests: You are to strike off and deduct all Fractions of odd Acres, Roods, and Pearches, taking care that there be not above the one hundred part of any such sum or sums of Money or proportions of Lands, respectively deducted from any one per∣son without his own consent, and that you do keep an exact and particular accompt of all the said Deductions in Money or Lands, and cause the same to be satisfied as intirely as may be in such convenient proportions, and in such places as the chief Governour or Governours of Our said Kingdom for the time being shall appoint, which proportions are to be reserved to be disposed of unto such use or uses as We, Our Heirs, or Successors shall appoint. The aforesaid Adventurers and Souldiers being satisfied, and the Reprizes made, and the several business finished, as before is directed, you are to deliver up your Books not before in these Instructions otherwise disposed of, unto Our Auditor General of that Our Kingdome of Ireland, and Duplicates of the same to Our Surveyor General, in their Offices to re∣main as of Record. In the management of which said Trust, you are from time to time, as the case shall require, to give an accompt to Our Chief Governour or Governours for the time being, and Our Council in Ireland, of your Proceedings, and to observe and follow such further directions as you shall from time to time receive from Vs, or from them pursuant to this Act. And for the more due and impartial execution of Our said Declaration and these Instructions, it is Our will and plea∣sure, That no Commissioner or other person imployed, acting in this Service shall till the Work be finished purchase by themselves or others in their behalf, or to their Vse, or in Trust for them or any of them, any of the Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, that are to be setled, confirmed, reprized, or restored by virtue of Our said Declaration, but shall before they enter upon this Trust respectively give in Lists under their Hands of such Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, as they are Intituled to, or possest of, to the Lord Lieutenant, or other Chief Governour or Governours, and Council for the time being, who are to take care for the observing this in∣struction.
And you are hereby further required, to Reprize John Lord Viscount Massareene and his Heirs, with an Estate of like yearly Rent in the Province of Leinster, to that of which he stands seized in the Barony of Dunluce, in the County of An∣trim, and to cause Our Letters dated the Eighteenth day of December, One thousand six hundred and Sixty, and the Fourteenth of August, One thousand Six hundred Sixty and one, to be put into speedy execution for the full satisfaction of the said Lord Massareene to all intents and purposes; which being done, you are then to cause the said Estate whereof the said Lord Massareene is seized in the Barony aforesaid, to be delivered to Daniel O Neil Groom of Our Bed-Chamber, in sa∣tisfaction for an Incumbrance of a much greater value where∣with the Barony of Dunluce set out to the Adventurers stands charged for the behoof of the said Daniel O Neil.
