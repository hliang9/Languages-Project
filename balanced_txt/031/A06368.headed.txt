A declaration made and published by the King of France, whereby the Princes, Dukes, and Barons therein named, are all proclay∣med Traytors, if within one moneth after the publication thereof they doe not ceasse from armes, and personally present them∣selues vnto his Maiestie. Published the 6. of August, 1620. Stylo nouo. LEWES, By the grace of God, King of France and Nauarre, To all men to whom these presents shall come, greeting. If since the time that We were invested with, and haue vnder-taken the gouern∣ment of this State, We had failed in any thing, either in regard of the Queene Our most ho∣nourable Lady and Mother, or in respect of the Princes & noble Personages of Our King∣dome, We would with more patience receiue and beare the troubles which therein at this present are stirred vp and raysed against Vs. But calling to mind such accidents as are for∣merly past, and considering what fruit the fa∣uours, graces, and benefits, by Vs so liberally imparted vnto those, who at this day trouble Vs: Wee cannot so soone bewaile Our hard
fortune, as also that of all France in generall, but Wee must withall accuse and vtterly con∣demne the small consideration of those, that reward Vs euill for good. For all men know, that presently vpon Our acceptation and en∣trance into the administration of publike af∣faires, Our first care was to deliuer the Princes and great Persons of Our Realme from the op∣pression and trouble wherein they were, and to speake truth, from vtter ruine and destruc∣tion, which then was like to fall vpon them; and drew them neare vnto Our person: and nothing but the emulation and iealousies that was then betweene them, hindred them from being of Our Councell, and priuie to the con∣duction and ordering of Our Princely affaires. Touching the Queene our most Princely Lady and Mother, Wee gaue and yeelded vnto her all that honor which the state of things at that time might beare, and procured the meanes to make her enioy all contentments that shee could wish or desire. After that when she had withdrawne her selfe from Blois to Angou∣lesme, there to frame a publike complaint, be∣cause (as shee said) shee was hindred from the enioying of Our presence, although for Our owne parts Wee were much offended at the behauiours of those that were her assistants, and had power sufficient to punish their inso∣lencies, We were content for her satisfaction
to grant her all whatsoeuer shee desired, the Townes, Forts, and gouernments which shee would choose, such mony as shee required to haue; and not onely were pleased, that shee should reside neare vnto Vs, but did so instant∣ly seeke it of her, that then at that time shee came to Vs to Tours, with such and so great cōfidence, that We were wholly out of doubt that nothing in subsequent time would alter her minde. Wee likewise, for her sake, pardo∣ned those that had ayded and assisted her, and made diuers of them Captaines of Our guard, which before had abandoned Vs to follow her. After We had effected all that, which We had promised vnto her, with long patience Wee expected, but could not see those of her part performe that whereunto they were bound: and yet for all that, Wee abstayned not from gratifying her in all things that shee desired and required at Our hands, not only in respect of her selfe, but also of those that held with her; as also continually to cause diuers great Personages and men of qualitie to visite her, and instantly solicited her to come neare vnto Vs, so farre, that being aduertised that cer∣tayne malicious spirits, made her beleeue, that Our desire therein was cleane contrary to the outward shew We made: to giue her more as∣surance both of Our intent & the respect that We beare vnto her, We set forward to meete
her in the middle way, at such time as she had promised to come; and are perswaded, that if therein shee had only beene ruled by her selfe, and her owne good disposition, Wee should not haue fayled at this present of a great con∣solation, and our Realme of an entire and as∣sured tranquilitie. But vnmeasurable ambition which prouoketh the spirits of many great Personages in Our Realme, that fill their heads with discontentments, and makes them weary of ease and quietnesse, hath beene the cause that disagreeing among themselues, touching their owne particular affaires, they haue in ge∣neral plotted together to effect some nouelties in the State: and to trouble Our Realme, vpon and vnder the same pretences, which all those that formerly attempted the same haue practi∣sed. And because they were perswaded that the person of Our said Lady and Mother in her respect, might better cloake, disguise, and strengthen these disseings; there is no man∣ner of artificiall practises wherewith they haue not serued their turnes, to put distrust into her breast, to alter her good intentions, and to perswade her that shee had wrong done vn∣to her, if shee had not an absolute authoritie giuen her in Our Realme. And although the euill (which therein maketh Vs too much feele her ouer-great facilitie) toucheth Vs to the quicke, yet Wee hold her excuseable, being
perswaded, that not many spirits in the world are able to withstand and resist so many, conti∣nuall, and damnable inuentions. And although We heare her name vsed in all places, and her signature and seale euen throughout all Our Prouinces, to authorize that which is preten∣ded against Vs, yet We cannot be perswaded but that her heart is wholly alienated from the same, and her soule altogether innocent. But for that, at the pursuit of the complaints that are made in her name throughout all Our Realme, and of the protestations to reforme Our State, Wee haue seene Our Cousin the Duke of Mayen withdraw himselfe from Our Court, without taking leaue of Vs; the Duke de Vandosme Our naturall brother follow af∣ter him, Our Cousin the Duke de Longueville being sent for to come vnto Vs, refuseth to do it; Our Cousin the Duke de Nemours gone from Vs in the night-time. And since that (which most grieueth Vs) Our deare and lo∣uing Cousin the Earle of Soissons, and Our Cousin his mother, likewise gone from Our Court by night, then when We were vpon the point to honour him with the mariage of Our sister: Which also was seconded by Our natu∣rall brother the great Prior of France; and soone after were aduertised that all of them were gone to Our said Lady and Mother, to∣gether with the Dukes de Rets, de la Trimo∣ville,
de Rohan, and de Rohanois, and the a∣gents of the said Dukes de Mayen and Esper∣non, to take order to leuy armes, & to giue a beginning to the execution of their deseignes: We vnderstood, that as soone as they had se∣duced all Our Regiments, to put them into Metz, they intended therewith to disarme all the inhabitants thereof. Wee were presently informed of negotiations made with stran∣gers, to cause them to enter into Our Realme, that the greatest part of the Nobilitie of Our Prouinces are practised withall, the souldiers seduced, prouisions of armes and munitions made, deseignes agreed vpon to bee put in practise against certayne Townes, and Forts, Our money taken and stayed in the Receits of Xainctes, Saint Iohn, Fontenay, Angiers, Chinon, and other places: Commissions deli∣uered out (whereof some fell into Our hands) to leuy foote and horse-men, garrisons put in∣to Our Townes, Craon besieged and taken. And that which touched Vs nearest of all, was, to vnderstand that Our Duchy of Normandie was like wholly to be lost, whereby Wee per∣ceiued that Our good Citie of Paris would by that meanes be brought to a miserable and pi∣tifull estate. Preferring the good of Our Sub∣iects before Our owne life, onely taking Our Guard with Vs, We went presently to Roane, from whence the Duke de Longueville (a∣bashed
at Our resolution) withdrew himselfe, and gaue Vs meanes to assure that towne from the spoile, which without doubt, it had endu∣red, if Wee had not come thither; as it was publikely declared vnto Vs by Our Court of Parliament in the same Towne, at such time as We there sate in the seate of Iustice. After that, hauing within two dayes reassured the state of that Towne, and seised vpon the old Palace, We went to Caen, where We entred into the Castle, & made trenches close to the walls, in such manner that those that were be∣sieged within it, perceiued themselues to bee out of all hope of any ayde, and yet ceased not insolently to shoot at Vs, at such time as they knew that We were gone to visit the trenches: which neuerthelesse, withdrew Vs not from v∣sing mercy and clemency towards them, and so much the rather, because they made their excuses, that they were commanded by Our said Lady Mother, to hold the place strong a∣gainst Vs: alwayes desiring more and more to witnesse and shew Our patience, and the re∣spect that Wee had vnto her. Since that Wee reduced the Townes of Alençon, Vernevil, Dreux, and la Ferte-Bernard, vnder Our obe∣dience. And now, for that Wee vnderstand that the Armie that is in the field, vnder the borrowed name of Our said Lady Mother, hath besieged and taken the Towne of la Fle∣sche,
wherein the hart of Our late most Prince∣ly Lord and Father is buried, and marcheth forward to besiege the Towne of Mans, Wee draw Our Armie thither to deliuer it from the siege which it feareth, and to withdraw the o∣ther out of the hands of insolent souldiers, who hauing violated the fidelity which they owe vnto Vs, may well violate the respect which they owe to the memory, and to the ashes of Our said Lord and Father. But before Wee march forward, to employ Our iust and necessary armes, to suppresse the audacious∣nesse of those that haue taken and beare armes against Vs, intruding vpon Our authority, and seeke to inuade Our Prouinces: Our desire is, that euery man should manifestly know and vnderstand Our intent, and make those that offend Vs, see that the greatnes of their faults (although most extreme) cannot attayne to the height of Our clemency, if they would haue recourse thereunto; and that neglecting the same, We will and pretend to make them suffer and feele the rigour which the Lawes and Ordinances of Our Realme haue decreed against them. Therefore, We make it knowne that after We had taken order about these af∣faires, by the aduice of Our Councell, consi∣sting of Our most deare and onely louing bro∣ther the Duke of Aniou, Our most deare and beloued Cousin the Prince of Conde, first
Prince of Our bloud, together with diuers Cardinalls, Dukes, Peeres, Officers of Our Crowne, and principall Lords of Our said Councell; by their aduice, We haue decreed and signified, and by these presents decree and signifie, that touching the Queene Our said Lady and Mother, We doe not beleeue, nei∣ther can be perswaded, that shee hath forgot∣ten the amity and loue which nature bindeth her to beare vnto Vs, and the memorie of Our said Lord and Father exacteth from her: and which Wee haue sought to deserue at her hands. And although it should fall out, that shee should vse other comportments towards Vs then shee ought to doe, We are determi∣ned with religious patience to endure them, and that when Our Army approcheth neare vnto that which is assembled in her name, We will not employ Our forces to any other end, then to deliuer her out of the hands of those, who to the preiudice of Vs and our Realme, captiuate her spirits, and her will; and to with∣stand the effecting of those desseignes which they haue for the ruine of Our state. Touching Our Cousin the Earle of Soissons, and Our Cousin the Countesse his Mother, the Dukes de Vandosme, the great Prior of France, the Dukes de Longueville, de Nemours, de May∣en, d'Espernon, de Rets, de la Trimoville, de Rohan, de Rohanois, the Marshall de Bois
Dauphin, the Earle de Candale, the Marquis de la Valette, the Archbishop of Tholose, and others the Officers of Our Crowne, We en∣ioyne and most expresly command them, to leaue off their Armes, and to surcease from all acts of hostilitie against Our subiects; to leaue all leagues and confederacies, as well within as without Our Realmes, and within one mo∣neth next after ensuing the Publication of these presents, to come personally vnto Vs, thereby to giue vs more and better assurance: which doing, We will remit all crimes and of∣fences by them done vnto Vs, in this last com∣motion, promising to receiue them againe in∣to Our fauour, and giue such assurance there∣of by writing, as they shall thinke necessary for the same: likewise commanding all others that haue taken their parts, and vnder the name of Our said Lady and Mother haue borne armes, and consequently, vsed acts of hostility, or o∣therwise, that haue made themselues culpable towards Vs, that if they withdraw themselues from the said armes, and before the nearest Iudges that shall be vnto them, declare, that they willingly withdraw themselues from the said party, league, and association, they shall be acquitted and discharged by vertue of these presents, and neuer be troubled nor molested for the same: and fayling to doe it, & to accept of this Our present pardon, within the said
time, which being once past, for the present as well as then, We haue and by these presents doe declare al the said Princes, Dukes, Peeres, and Officers of Our Crowne aforesaid, and o∣thers, of what quality, state, and condition so∣euer they be, which haue directly or indirectly beene participants in the said associations, pro∣ceedings, practises, leuies, bearing of armes, & acts aforesaid, mentioned, to be guiltie of high treason, & perturbers of the cōmon peace and quietnesse of Our Realme, and thereby to haue incurred the forfeiture of all honors, gouern∣ments, dignities, offices, benefices, seises, lands, and Signiouries whatsoeuer they hold of Vs, to be revnited to Our Crowne. And for the better declaration and execution of the paynes imposed vpon, and set downe against such crimes, by the Lawes and Ordinances of Our Realme, We will that all Our Iudges shal proceed orderly against them and their poste∣rities, in euery place, where the knowledge thereof is brought vnto them. And therefore command Our louing and faithfull Counsel∣lors of Our Courts of Parliament, Bailifes, Stewards, Iudges, or their Lieutenants, and all others Our Iustices and Officers, to whom particularly it shall or may appertayne, to cause these Our present Letters of Declarati∣on to be read, published, and registred, and from point to point exactly to execute, keepe,
and inuiolably obserue the same, according to the tenour and forme thereof, charging Our Attourneyes generall and their Substitutes, to make all pursuites, and to vse all diligence therein according to the tenour of their Offi∣ces, for such is Our pleasure: In witnesse whereof, We haue caused Our Seale to be set to these presents.
