A TESTIMONY Against the False TEACHERS OF THIS GENERATION By one who is come from under them, unto the true Teacher and shepherd of the soul. THirty years (or more) I was a hearer of the Priests, while I did see that they had an end more then to the glory of God; they turned their coats when they saw that tythes should be taken from them; then did I leave them when I saw that, then did I see that they were not the Ministers of God, but they were hirelings & false tea∣chers, & remains so to this day, & leads the people into captivity, and preaches peace to them so long as they will put into their mouths, and tells them they can never be free from sin in this life; but when I came to be lighted with the light of Jesus Christ, I saw another thing, (though before I had run from it as others do, but) then it brought thought, word, and deed to judgement, and all that had been done to that day, and it let me see that Priests and people were professing the Saints words, & out of the life & pow∣er of the Saints; it let me see all sects and judgements of men, all
out of the life and power of God, Anabaptists, and o∣thers, a teaching people, and need to be taught themselves, so as I came to be obedient, and the old bottle to be broke, the new Wine came to be poured in: Now the Scripture was given to the Scribes & Pharisees in parables; now to come to read your selves with the light of Christ Jesus, you will witness the Scripture true, it wil be no more a parable to you, as you come to let the Witness of Jesus Christ arise in you, you shall be made a new by the power of the pure spirit of the Son of God, it will teach you to deny all ungodliness, you shall need go to no man to be taught, it wil bring you out of all the wayes of the World, fashions, customs, and traditions, and the Worldly-Worships, and out of all their ways, into the one way, to be led by the spirit of the Son of God; none comes at the Father, but whom is lead by the spirit of his Son; who∣ever believes in him, he gives them power to be sons and daugh∣ters of God, no more bond-men, but made free-men, & free-wo∣men, living obedient unto his command, to that measure made manifest to us, all outward things done away & by his power are made new, & born again: Now by this Power our blind eyes comes to be opened, and our deaf ears to hear, and our hearts comes to understand the things belonging unto our peace; and as we are faithful and obedient, we come to see our selves, and to see what acts for God, and what acts against him; and as this Work goes forward, we cannot submit to the will of man, but to the will of God; Christ was counted a deceiver when he was upon the earth, so was Paul and Silas, so are the Lords Prophets now: Christ was called Beelzebub, the Prince of the Devils, and Christ is our ex∣ample, to the measure of him I direct you: You say, you believe in Christ, and remains in darkness, and so you are lyars; for them that believes in Christ, and comes into obedience to him, they receive power from him to overcome uncleanness, and therefore you are seen to profess Christ with your lips, & your hearts far from him; you are seen in your fallen estate, alienated from the Lord, for the Lord speaks no peace to the wicked: Who comes to be Witnesses for the Lord, witness his Word as sharp as a two-edged Sword, and as a flame of fire that burns up all that stands against him. This is the truth of the Lord God to you all where ever this comes; you can read this Work is to be done in the Scriptures
without you; Christ saith, Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal life, and they are them that testifies of me, but ye will not come unto me that ye may have life; but profess what you will of the Scriptures without you, until you come to be obedient to the light of Christ Jesus within you, the Scripture cannot you know; and as you become obedient to the light of Christ, you will come into the life and power which gave them forth, and to witness the Scripture true, and it will be no more a parable to you, for this is the day of the Lords power, it is he that searcheth the heart, and tryeth the reins, (I witness it) he leaves no corner unsearch't; he is come to look for fruit, that tree that does not bring fruit unto God, is to be hewed down; he is gathering his people together, and building them up upon his holy Mountain, Christ Jesus the Son of God: To you which are of the World, I write this, that the Lord would gather you, but you refuse to be gathered by him no further then your own will; Therefore I warn you in the fear of the Lord, as you prize your everlasting peace with him, to be∣come obedient to the Witness of the Lord within you; but this you cannot know in your fallen Wisdom; therefore I warn you to let the time past that you have spent in your pride, in your vain glory, & vain sporting your selvs be sufficient, & be obedient to the Light of Christ Jesus within you, that you may no more be diso∣bedient, but obedient, that you may no longer be professors, but to possess with them that are come to be servants of God, & lives in obedience to him every day, and is able, and knows the great in∣comes of the love of God, and knows their daylie bread from him who sits upon the Throne at the right hand of his Father. This am I eternally moved to write to you all, therefoee search & try your hearts with the light of Christ Jesus, & prize your everlast∣ing peace wth him: In Adam all men fel; but God so loved the world he gave his onely begotten Son for a ransom for our sins, that whoever believed in him, (in the second Adam) comes to witness the old Adams state before he fel, if you would but let that light of Christ arise which shines in your dark hearts, & read your selvs wth it, it would open the hidden treasure of the everlasting Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which has been hid from many generati∣ons by the dark power of Satan. Truth shall stand though Gog and Magog doe resist it.
Hear the Word of the Lord ye Priests of England, ye that call your selves Ministers of Christ, (yet falsly) thus saith the Lord, Wo unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter my flock, saith the Lord; ye scatter and thrust out my flock, & look not upon them; therefore now will I visit the wickedness of your imaginations, saith the Lord, & I will gather together the remnant of my flock from all lands, and will bring them again to their folds, that they may grow and encrease; I will set shepherds also over them, which shall feed them, & there shall none of them be lost, saith the Lord. Now mark and consider ye Priests of England, is not this your own condition? Are not you scattering the people abroad, as it were, sowing pillows under their elbows, in telling them that there is no perfection in this life, and though they continue in sin, yet when they dye they shall be saved by the death of Christ? When as in the least measure you have not brought them to that which is the first step to know Christ by, which is the light of Christ mani∣fest within them; so you (as it were) thrust them away from the knowledge of Christ, deceiving them, telling them that that which is a true Witness of Christ within them, is but the light of nature, or something of a little value, which I bear a testimony for, will lead them into the way of truth, and so to the true knowledge of Christ Jesus. I have seen (saith the Lord) also among the Prophets, foul adultery, and presumptuous yes, they take the most shameful men by the hand, flattering them, so that they cannot return from their wickedness. Now mark and consider, is not this your condition? If any of the servants of the Lord be sent with a Message from the Lord to the people, and any wicked man lay violent hands upon them, you do as it were take them by the hand, and join with them in impri∣soning them, and whipping them, stocking them, stoning them, & despiteful using them, declaring to the people that they are sedu∣cers, deceivers, Jesuits, deluders, vomiting out most falsly all man∣ner of lyes against them, so that you keep the people that they cannot return from their wickedness. Therefore dear friends and people, turn your minds to that of Christ within you, which ma∣keth known unto you all the evil of your doings, whereof I am a Witness to this day; and as you come to mind it, it will shew you the intents and secrets of your hearts, & bring to light the works
which are not wrought in God; and turn away from these dumb shepherds, which no longer then you are putting into their mouths, will speak to you; and consider what you have profited by them, how many of you have been under their Ministry, some thirty, some forty years, some more, some less, but what can you witness (as in the presence of God) you have profited by them? Therefore thus saith the Lord, I have not sent these prophets, and yet they run; I have not spoken to them, and yet they preached; but if they had continued in my counsel, they had opened to my people my words, and they had turned my people from their evil wayes, and wicked imagina∣tions. Therefore, dear friends, consider how many thousands have been followers of them these many years, and still continues in their evil ways, and wicked imaginations; therefore thus saith the Lord, Hear not the word of the prophets that preach unto you, and de∣ceive you, truly they teach you vanity, for they speak the meaning of their own hearts, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. Consider I pray you, do not the Priests of England at this day speak divinations of their own brain, taking other mens lines, & spea∣king from them their own thoughts, not witnessing (in the least) the life and power of those that spake those words? Therefore in love to your souls do I warn you to turn to the Witness of Christ within you, which will guide you into the way of truth, which will bring you to the Father; for saith Christ, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me: So now here is set before you the way to God; here (I say) is set before you life and death. Thus saith the Lord God which gathered toge∣ther the scattered people, I will bring yet another Congregation to him; Come all ye Beasts of the field, that ye may devour, all the beasts of the wood; for his watchmen are all blind, they have altogether no understan∣ding, they are all dumb dogs, not being able to bark; they are sleepy, sluggish are they, and lye snorting, the shepherds have no understanding, but every man turneth his own way, every one after his own covetousness with all his power. Therefore friends & people, consider in the fear of the Lord, (I speak in love to your souls) Is not this the condition of the Priests of England at this day? Are they not covetous? Do they not preach for hire? Do they not seek for large preferments? Do they not leave their flock, and go from one place to another for larger revenues? Do they not seek for gain from their quar∣ters,
and if you do not give them, do they not prepare prisons for you? Therefore thus saith the Lord, The righteous perisheth, and no man regardeth it in his heart; godly people are taken away, and no man considereth it: Therefore thus saith the Lord, Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye dye? As I live, I do not desire the death of a sinner; heark∣en diligently unto me, for lo (saith the Lord) I will teach you wisely. And now I have a Word to you of the baptized Churches, you that say you are the Churches of Christ, and none but you, take heed, and do not go forth in imitations of the Apostles, into wash∣ings and dippings, and breaking of bread, and laying on of hands, not having the same call which the Apostles had; but come down to the Witness of God within you, and there see with the light of Christ within you, whether you be baptized your selves with Christs Baptism, vvhich is with the Holy Ghost and vvith fire; see vvithin you if you have passed through the fire vvhich John speaks of; Verily (saith John) I baptize with water, but there comes one after me which will baptize with the holy Ghost, and with fire, (vvhich is Christs baptism.) So I say, Come to see your selves first baptized vvith Christ's baptism, before you go forth to baptize others; For verily (saith Christ) I will not be worshipped in Temples made with hands, neither with any outward observations, but he that worships me, shall worship in spirit and in truth, for my dwelling is amongst the sons of men. I desire every one that reads this, to read with the light of Christ within them; for many false things are cast upon the children of light for beating their testimony for the Lord Jesus Christ, having nothing justly to lay to their charge; let all sober people vvhich cometh to read this, judge of it, whether these who falsly accuse the upright and innocent, be not shut out from the kingdom of God, yea or nay, when Christ saith, He will judge every one ac∣cording to the deeds done in the body, whether good or evil; I warn you in the fea and dread of the Lord, That you let the time satisfie which you have spent in your pride, & wicked words and actions against the pure spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ for it vvill not satisfie him, that you say, you know him, and with your lips profess him, and denies him in his works, and in his wayes; ye are found in false accusing, lying, and slandering, and with all manner of unclean Words, Works, and Actions; for them that
bears their testimony for him & against unclean spirits, are made by his power to declare against them where ever they come; they reckon us as Hereticks, but it is little to us, for reproaches are our riches; but it is none but them vvho are of that generation which called the Master of the house Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils, vvhich are found in the evil practices now; but this is the day of the Lords power vvherein light is come into the World, but men loves darkness rather then light, because their deeds are evil; They will not come to me that they may have life, that their deeds (which are evil) may be judged, and such as are acted in the light, justified, and they reconciled unto me, saith Christ. And vve that are the children of the Lord, do bear our testimony that this is the day vvhich the Lord vvill pour out his spirit upon all flesh, his sons and daughters shall prophesie; and this is the day vvherein he is manifesting his povver amongst the sons of men, and maketh knovvn his mind to his sons, and to his daughters. Therefore fear and tremble before the Lord all ye that live in the World vvithout a God, What vvill ye do in the day of your calamity, vvhen the Lord God shall come to call you to judgement, to give account for vvhat you have done in the flesh, vvhether it be good or evil? Therefore hear the Word of the Lord all you that make a mock of the Lord, and of his appearance; thus saith the Lord, Thus long have I ever holden out mine hands to an unfaithful people that go not the right way, but after their own imaginations, to a people that is ever defying me to my face; if thou comest nigh them, they say, Touch me not, for I am holyer then thou; all these men, when I am angry, shall be turned into smoke and fire that shall burn them for ever; behold it is written before my face, saith the Lord, and shall not be forgotten, but recompenced; I will reward it to them into their bosoms, I mean your misdeeds, and the mis∣deeds of your fathers together, saith the Lord; but I will take a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah, one to take possession of my hill, my cho∣sen shall possess it, and my servants shall dwell there, therefore will I number you to the sword, that ye shall be destred all together, for that when I called, ye gave me no answer; when I spake, ye hearkened not to me, but did wickedness before me, and those ing that leased me not; therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shll eat, but ye shall have hunger; Behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall have thirst; behold, my servants shall be merry, but ye shall be
confounded; behold, my servants shall rejoice for very quietuess of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and complain for vexation of minde; your name shall ye leave accursed among my chosen; for God shall slay you, and call his servants by another Name; whoso rejoiceth upon earth, shall rejoice in the Lord, the true God; for the old afflicti∣ons shall be forgotten, and taken away out of my sight; for lo, I shall make a new heaven, and a new earth, and as for the old, they shall ne∣ver more be thought upon, nor kept in mind; but the Lord saith, Be glad, and evermore rejoice for the things that I shall do; for why, behold I will make a joyful Hierusalem, and his people joyful; yea I my self will rejoyce with Hierusalem, and be glad with my people, and the voice of weeping and wailing shall not be heard in her from thenceforth; they shall build houses, and dwell in them; they shall not build, and another possess; they shall plant Vinyards, and eat of the fruit of them; they shall not plant, and another eat; but the life of my people shall be like a tree, and mine elect shall still enjoy the work of their hands, they shall not labour in vain, nor beget with trouble, for they are the high blessed seed of the Lord, & their fruits are with them; and it shall be, ere ever they call, I will answer them; while they are but yet thinking how to speak, I will hear them; the Wolfe and the Lamb shall feed together, and the Lyon shall eat hay like the Bullock, but Earth shall be they pents meat; the shall no manstay nor hurt one another in all my holy ill, saith the Lord. Therefore in the  of the Lord, come down to his witness within you, all you who are abroad wandering up and down, seek∣ing rest from the mothes of men, and climbing up to heaven to your own wills; and  the spirit of truth, which is the spirit of the living God; bu I say, Woe unto all those who stands in opposition against thspirit of truth; I say, eternally woe, and plagues, and misery a from the Lord God will come upon all those that opposeth the Son of God in his appearance; there∣fore I say, repent repent, repent, while the door of mercy is open unto you lest ye ut out; for without stands dogs; whoremon∣gers; adulterers,  all that tells lies; therfore, I say, let this be a warning to you  from the Lord; least you have your portion amongst the hyptes, where is weeping, and wailing, and gna∣shing of teeth for ever. This is from one who is a witness to the everlasting Truth, Margaret Abbtt. THE END
