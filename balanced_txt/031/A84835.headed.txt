A VVARNING FROM THE LORD TO THE POPE; And to all His Train of Idolatries: WITH A Discovery of his false Imitations, and Likenesses, and Traditional Inventions, which is not the Power of God. AND A Testimony against his Foundation, to the over∣throw of the whole Building: and a Witness by the Spirit of God a∣gainst his Dead-Worship of Dead Idols; and the false Imitation of false Crosses, which is not the power of God un∣to salvation, but delusion unto damnation.

By a Lover of Souls, G. F. LONDON; Printed for Giles Calvert, at the Black-spread-Eagle, neer the West-end of Pauls, 1656.
All you that do rejoyce in the Flesh, and glory in it, and not in the Cross of Christ, which is the power of God; which power of God overthrows the flesh, which they rejoyce in, and glorying a∣riseth out of, which flesh imitates a Cross, and in it glories, and bowes down to it, which is o∣verthrown with the Cross of Christ, the power of God; the power of God throwes down all dead Crosses, and that which sets them up, and that which bowes dovvn to them. THe Papish foundation is that which is from the Light; and out of that ariseth all the likenesses and images, and that is it which worships Names, which is out from the Light, which Light from Christ Jesus the Foundation doth come: And that is it which puts bread and wine for the body and blood of Christ, which is out from the Light of Christ, in the transgression, out from the Light, and that will-murther: All people, Priests and Teach∣ers, that be from the Light, and out of it, and it doth not own, be in the same ground and nature, though one colour may differ from another, yet they be all from the Light, and will push against the Saints that be in the Light; though they may get the Saints words declared forth from the Light, yet be out of the Light it self: Now the Apostles saw many which were enemies to the cross of Christ; who minded earthly things who served not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own bellies; and such as got the form of godliness, and had not the power; which kept people alwayes learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, but did resist it, being reprobate concerning the faith, and saw such as gat the fair words, and the fair speeches, which deceived the hearts of the simple; and saw the false prophets that should rise, the false
Teachers, and these be all they that do not own the Light, but be out from it, in the world, in the wickedness, and such as be enemies to the cross of Christ, who mindes earthly things, and serves not our Lord Je∣sus Christ; such their mindes are not guided with the light, but mindes the earthly; and that minde which is from the light, minding the earthly, it mindes an earthly cross, and mindes earthly images; and these earthly things, and outward Names, and worships them; and these makes likenesses of Males, and likenesses of Females, and the images, shewing that they are strangers from the life of the Law, which was in the dayes of old, and they were not to make the likeness of any thing in heaven, nor in the earth, nor in the sea, nor under the earth, nor bow down to them, nor worship them: Now the Law witnesseth against these; where the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled, Christ is owned; these likenesses are not held up, but the ground of them is removed: but when they were gone from the life of the Law, and them that was from the Law, though many might get the words of the Law without the life, but worshipped the Host of heaven, and made images and likenesses, moulten Images, and graven Images, and set up Gods of Stone, and Gold, which could neither hear nor see, such as were gone from the life of the Law, whose mindes were in the earth; and such as were Hea∣then, that were in the transgression, and knew not the living God, these minded earthly things, and images, likenesses, and served the creature more then the Creator, God blessed for ever. Now these Papists which have the form of godliness, the Prophets words, Christs words, and the Apostles words, and Moses words to talk of, and have your Churches, as you call it, and your Teachers, and Priests, and your Elders, and Fathers, which be from the light, shewing your selves to be in the nature and state of them that were from the life of the Law, the life of Christ and the Apostles, and are the Heathen, though, as I said before, many had the words of the Law, yet they were making likenesses and images, who minded earthly things, as you do, which be from the Light, minding earthly things, making images of Male and Female, as they did who had the words of Christ and the A∣postles, and dead crosses to bow to, as they had dead Gods to call upon. So here you are enemies to the cross of Christ, who minde the earth∣ly things, against whom the Lords Sword of his Spirit is turned; so you that are here minding earthly things, crosses, images, crucifixes, are from the Light, so from the Way, which is the Light, in your own in∣ventions, serving dead images, dead crosses, as they served dead gods and dead images in times past, as the Heathen did: So your mindes be∣ing in the earth, minding these earthly things, your wisdom is earthly,
censual, and devillish; and will-murther, that is your Principle, which is one of the devils Principles, who is a murtherer; so you that be from the Truth, in the Heresie, there is the Heresie and the Hereticks, and the Apostates from the Light, from the truth, out of the truth, that which is to be rejected, being from the Light, Strangers from the body of Christ and his blood that cleanseth from all sin, that offering that perfects for ever them that are sanctified. So out of that minde which is from the light, doth arise all these likenesses, and all these images, all this worshipping of Names, for the light brings to Christ, who is the way to the Father, and to have unity with the spirits of just men made perfect; but you that be from this light, your mindes runs in all these dead things and inventing of them, and so this came in since the Apostles time, who was sent to turn people from darkness to the Light, and from the power of Satan unto God; so your Church is but the likeness of a Church, as your cross∣es and images is the l kenesses of Mary, &c. [Mark the Apostle,] but are in the likenesses, and know not the true Christ, who are from the Light; and the Apostles which were in the light, saw those that crept in, and came in, which was from the light in those dayes, (which Apostles were in the light of the Church, the Pillar and Ground of Truth) which hath reigned since the Apo∣stles time, but now discovered with the same light the Apostles was in, with which they saw it enter, its ground which is from the light, minding the earth∣ly, as the heathen did that were in the transgression, and where the death reigned; so as your similitudes, as you call them, whose mindes is from the light which gives to see the substance, are as the Images amongst them in the dayes of old, which were in the transgression from the light; so to you are your si∣militudes, likenesses, and images which you bow down to, who be from the light, and so from Christ and his cross; now the cross is to keep the mind out of all things that do change; here is the cross, to have the minde kept out of all things that doth change, to set up nothing, to worship nothing but God alone; no not the Angels, they must worship the Son; for the Apostle that was in the light, gloryed in nothing, save in the cross of our Lord Iesus Christ, which cross to the World is Foollishness, but to them that are saved it is the Power of God: [mark] the Preaching of the Cross, is the Power of God to them that are saved, but to them that perish it is Foolishness; and where the Gospel is talked of with the Wisdom of words which be out of the Light, the Cross of Christ is made of non-effect: And there are the VVise of the world, there is the Dispuer, and the wisdom of the world, which knows not God, which is earthly, from the Light, which God takes in their own craft, the weakness of God is stronger than men; Now them that do mind Earthly things, are Enemies to the cross of our Lord Jesus, Christ, which cross is the power of God to them that are saved, which Power of God, where the
light is believed in, and guides the minde, it overthrows the earthly, removes the earthly, the Founder of the images; out of which earthly the inventions doth arise, which is from the Light; and that which is from the Light, invents something, an Image, and bowes down to it, and would have all others bow down to it, which he hath invented; and that calls others Hereticks which will not bow down to his image which he hath set up which is the Heretick: Now we which be in the Lght do these see and comprehend with the Light, and to you send this Message from the Lord, and to you it is the Word of the Lord God: The cross of Christ, which is the power of God, keeps the minde out of all earthly inventions, images, likenesses, the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, doth overthrow you and them, and the foundation in man that sets them up, and removes the ground and founder of them; and here is the cross of Christ, to have the minde guded of all the changeable, to the inchangeable, and the minde to dwell in the pow∣er which doth remove all the earth the wisdom riseth out of, and the invention, and the likeness of truth, and the images, and the earthly crosses; the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, removes all these earthly crosses, earthly images; which cross, which is the power of God, brings to know the image of the Son, who is the image of the Father, the brightness of his glory, the express image of his person; and all you, and they that have got the form of godliness, but not the power, which the Apostles saw then enter, who was in the power, which is the cross of Christ; all you that be out of the power, you are out of the cross of Christ, and it to you is foolishness; which cross of Christ is the power of God to them that are saved; which power of God overturns and overthrows all the changeable, with the power that changeth not; and to this pow∣er of God the soul must be subjct: And here is the cross of Christ, the power of God; and being subject to this cross of Christ, which is the power of God, which the Jews stumbled at, and the Grecians accounted foolishness: But this power of God, which is the cross of Christ, over∣throws all images, likenesses, and outward dead crosses; and manifests all them whose mindes be earthly, to be a dead Church, not the living, which is the Pillar and ground of truth: And now the cross of Christ which the Apostle speaks of, thousands do witness; with which power of God they know the image of the Son, and the image of the Father: All that be from the Light, from the Foundation, whose cross is an outward thing; dead things are strangers from the power of God, whidh is the cross of Christ; so you are in the perishing estate, as I said before, bow∣ing to dead images, dead crosses, worshipping names, teachers and people, that are out from the Light, as they were in the dayes of old, who are strangers from the life of the Law of God, who worshipped and and served the creature more then the Creator, made images and Gods as you do now, and worshipped them, as you do now, make crosses and
bow down to them, who know not the power of God, as you do not wh ch is the cross of Christ, but the power of God is manifest, which is, the cross of Christ to them that are saved, which gives to see all your dead images, dead crosses, crucifixes, likenesses, and images and the dead bodies of them; which power of God brings to trample upon them all; and that which guards them, and upholds them; which was the founder of them, the power of God; the cross of Christ brings to stand against the Founder of images, of your crosses, of your likenes∣ses, yea and all that have received your Mark; the power of God is turned against you, and you are to be threshed and judged, and tram∣pled upon: And Judgement set up in the earth, is the cross of Christ, which is the power of God, and the power of godliness, which differs from all them that have the form, and are enemies to the cross of Christ which is the power of God, whose souls are not to it subject; for that minde which is from the power of God, is making likenesses, minding earthly things, this is the enemy ro the cross of Christ; and that which throws down his foundation, his likeness, his image, his crosses, which are made by his wisdom, that which throws down his work which he hath set up, is foolishness to him that perisheth, but it is the power of God unto salvation unto them that are laved; which now the Light is manifesting the worlds works; and all such as have the form of godli∣ness, and not the power, have not the cross of Christ, which is the pow∣er of God; and where this is witnessed and enjoyed, it keeps the minde out of all other crosses, and making likenesses; and them that have not this cross, which is the power of God, are making dead crosses, and the dead bows down to the dead, and not to the living: but who have the cross of Christ, the power of God, and are in the Light, judgeth all them, and sees with the Light all their body to be from the Light, and to be overthrown, and with the power of God, the crosses and the inven∣ters of them; so that which hath manifest, and doth manifest, is Light; which Lights lets see Christ from whence it comes; I am the Light of the world, and doth inlighten every one that cometh into the world, saith Christ, who is the power of God: Now every one waiting in the Light which is inlightned withall, he shall receive the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, which will keep him from inventing any other likeness, or image, but he shall know the image of the Father, with the Light that comes from the Son: So to the Light in you all I speak, which comes from Christ the power of God, that with it you may see all your images, likenesses, and crosses, which your own hands have made, which worship the works of your own hands, as the Heathen did, That knw not God; your own images, your own crosses, your own crucifixes, images of Male and Female, and these l kenesses, which be the works of your own hands, who be strangers from the Light, the Power of God: but now is Christ come, and coming to destroy your works, who is the Power of God, for these be the
works of the Devil; and you cry up your own works, the works of your own hands, crosses, images, crucifixes, likenesses, as they cryed up Diana, that knoweth not the power of God; and as others in the old time cryed up their Gods, their moulten Images, and their likenesses, which worshipped the Host of Heaven, and worshipped and served the creature more then the Creator, who were strangers and Aliens from the life of God, the Covenant of Promise, their mindes being alienated abroad; and such whose mindes were here, were the inventers of the images, as yours is now, and fell down to them, and wor∣shipped them, and served them: Now here you are all in the same nature and steps, in the same wisdom of the earth, in the inventings, in the same murder∣ers spirit; them that will not conform to your images, that which is out of the truth, is out of the power, out of the cross of Christ, out of the power of God, with which power, which is the cross of Christ which is despised, and is base and contemptible with you and all the world, are you fathomed all, whosoever you be, of what form soever, that have the form of godliness, but not the power, the power it doth you comprehend, fathome and chain, which is the cross of our Lord Iesus Christ; your Images, your Crosses, your Names, your Crucifixes, your Fathers, your Elders, your Church, your Priests, your Iesuits, and all that have tasted of your ground, the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, doth comprehend you, and will bruise you, (which fathomes you) and your works breaks down; and Christ over all will reign, who treads the wine-press alone without the city, who is the power of God, whose arm is drawn, and sword is furbushed, out of whose mouth goes the two-edged-sword, and flames of fire: Your works is hem'd about, you are as a wilderness, where lodgeth the dragon, devourer, and destroyer, trees that cumber the ground, worshipping dead things, which earth hath brought forth briars and thorns, wherein the righteousness is not inherited; but now is the axe coming to your root, and laid to your root, your trees, your oaks, your pillars must be shaken, the Lord of hosts hath spoken it, he is rising with his arm, who will thresh you down, and cut you up, who have been a place for Dragons and a wil∣derness; but the Lord is now risen, and you shall not now cumber the ground, for he will turn you up by the roots, and root and branch must into the fire; who be all strangers from the power of God; God will hedge up your wayes, and bring you into a narrow compass with his power, which is the cross of our Lord Iesus Christ, who is coming to reign, and they that are in the power of God, are in the cross of our Lord Iesus Christ, and in it do rejoyce, and reign with him on the top of all your Crosses, and they be under their feet, and they be wood for the fire, stone to be thrown down, silver and gold that will cor∣rupt, and as it is with you, so it was in the dayes of old, part of that they made their God, they seethed their meat, they boyled and baked it; so part of that which you make your crosses, or crucifixes, or images, you either boyl or bake, or lay it upon the house; here shews the minde is from the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, which power overthrowes all the makers of the images, and the image, and the founder shall be confounded; the power is
risen against all your strength, the Lords power will be heavy upon you, which is the cross of Christ, which keeps out of them all, above them all, over them all, and a top of them all; the children of Light to trample upon them all, to con∣found them all, and to answer that of God in all in the sight of God; which power of God gives to see before they was, and before the world was; the image of God and his glory; and unto you this is the word of God, in which the children of Light are in, which light shall answer that light in every one of your consciences, which comes from Christ the Power of God, which light is your condemnation that it hate, and mindes all those earthly things before men∣tioned, which are out of the light, and for the cause of going into those things, Gods judgements and plagues comes upon you; but now the daughters of Sion are risen, and now are they a threshing hills and mountains; I am a weary of you saith the Lord, you have cumbred Gods ground, you have stained it with your Idols and with your images, it hath not her injoyed rest, nor her Sabbath; now will I rise in my power saith the Lord, and my sons and daughters which be in the power of God, in his cross, none of you can it escape, it will search you out, and finde you out, before it you cannot stand, with all your dead like∣nesses, dead crosses, crucifixes, images; they have conquered the earth; the power is risen to remove, to spue you out, you are not of his Church, which is Pillar and ground of Truth, Christ Iesus; for none comes to this church, but who comes to the cross of Christ, which is the Power of God, where the living stones are known, the spiritual house built, and the spiritual houshold built up together; this is before your dead images, and dead likenesses, and crosses, and crucifixes were: So now arm your selves and come to battel with all your dead Names, dead images, crosses, and crucifixes, who are as briars and thorns set in battel, and as venemous creatures that appear in the night, which are as the morter and the clay [minde] in the earth; upon you God will come, whose day is appearing, with his power, which is the cross of Christ, and break down your fenced places with his power, and exalt the Son of his truth upon the heads of you all; and so that which makes the outward crosses, is that which prisons the just in the particular, [mark] that is he that prisons the just in the general, which had his inquisition, the just to put in, which pri∣sons him with his will, who holds up the dead crosses, by him he is persecuted, whose cross is the power of God; so the earth which makes the outward crosses, that prisons the just; for if the power of God were owned; which is the cross of Christ [mark] that removes the earth which invents the outward crosses, and so this power lets forth the just from under the death, which death sets up dead crosses, and bows down to them, and not to the living God, but to the dead crosses, as they formerly bowed down to the dead gods, where the death reign∣ed; against such the sword of God was turned, and the children in the light stood against, and such took the children of Light captive, and imprisoned them, who imprisoned the just, them that served not the living God, but the dead gods, as you do your dead images, and in such death reigns; which cross the power of God is come, and cometh to be the death of; yea, and him that is
your Master who hath the powers of death, the devil, and all his works which are wrought in you, invented in you, and caused you to work, to be his ser∣vants, his laborers, his Messengers, his Apostles, his disciples; but Christ the pow∣er of God came to destroy his works, the works of the devil, and though Saints do witness the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, which drives back the Prince of the power of the air, and brings under, wherein the power of the Prince of Peace is received, which is the cross of Christ, the power of God, in which we glory. So you that be from the Light are seen, your ground, your root, your comings in, your body, your beginning, the light hath manifested, and the power is re∣ceived, which the cross of Christ brings to stand over you, in which power and light the children of light have unity, which light gives to see before the world was; and so from the light you are seen, where is the inchanter, the whoredom, the sorcery, the lust, the invention, the witchcraft, the inchantment, the will∣worship, the feigned humility, and the self-righteousness, cursed speaking, from the light, out of the power of God, with the light all this is here seen, jud∣ged and comprehended; for that which doth make manifest is light, that being received, Christ is received, who is not of the world, and the power of God is received, which is the cross of Christ, which keeps from the world and their inventions, but now are the several colours manifested, and the witchcraft manifested, and the whoredom manifested with the light; the separation which is self, and the form of godliness where is not the power; where there is not the power, there is not the cross of Christ; but now the cross of Christ, which is the power of God, is set upon all your heads, and God alone will be magnified in his power, which is the cross of Christ, glory be to him for ever. So you that have been in the inventing of crosses, who have said af∣ter Consecration, That the bread and wine was the very body and blood of Christ which you take and receive: Hath Christ another body and blood beside that? Do you look for a Christ to come beside the bread and wine, which you call the body of Christ after consecration, yea or nay? For he is come to reign, whose Government he bears upon his shoulders; him by whom the world was made before it was made, who before bread and wine was, lighteth every man that cometh into the world, that all men through him might believe; he that believeth shall be saved, and he that believeth not is condemned already: And this is the condemnation, the light, saith Christ: And Christ is exalt∣ing his cross, which is the power of God, which is to the world foolish∣ness, above all the dead crosses; for the cross of Christ, the power of God, is a living cross; which cross of Christ the Apostles preached; which cross was to the Jews a stumbling block; for this cross, which is the power of God, overthrows all the Jews services, their types, their shadows, their Altars, yea that Priesthood that took Tithes, their Temples; the Pow∣er of God, which is the cross of Christ, overthrows all this changeable, and the circumcision also; the cross of Christ, which is the power of God,
brought them to be the Temples of God, for the power of God over∣threw all that within which held up the outward; so the Power of God, the cross of Christ, brought them to witness the unchangeable Priest, without Father, without Mother; it overthrow the first covenant, and brought to see the end of it, how it waxt old; and brought to know the second covenant, the Power of God, which is the cross of Christ: So the cross of Christ keeps out of all the changeable, and brought to see the end of all the changeable, and before the changeable was, and the unchangeable that to witness: And the cross of Christ, the Power of God, overthrew that nature in the Gentiles, which had held up the dead Images, and served those gods which be no Gods: The cross of Christ, which is the Power of God, overthrew all that, and brought them to serve the living God, and to be after his image, created after God, and to come to know the lively Hope: And the cross of Christ, the Power of God, overthrew all Idols and Idolaters, yea, that which did worship Baal and his Priests. Them that witness the cross of Christ, witness the Power of God that overthrew all the changeable, and brought to the unchangeable; and the cross of Christ overthrew the worship that was in the will, for that is from the Power, which is the cross; it overthrew the feigned humili∣ty, for that is out of the Power of God, contrary to it, which is the cross of Christ, and self-righteousness, and self-justification, for all that is out of tha power, contrary to it, the Power of God, Christs cross: So the cross of Christ, which is the Power of God, overthrew all Types, Shadows, and brought to know the Substance, in which is our joy and glory: The cross, which is the Power of God, and the Power of God, which is the cross of Christ, overthrew all the heathenish nature, and the Images, and the Likenesses which proceeded from that nature, the dead Gods which they served, and worshipped not the living God; the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, overthrew all that: Therefore with the world it was judged foolishness; but it is to them that are saved the power of God, but to them that perish it is accounted foolishness: So now the cross of Christ which overthrew all the hea∣thenish nature, from which all images rise (they being from the Light and the power of God) they set them up, so worshipped the work of their own hands. The power of God, the cross of Christ which is now manifest, doth overthrow all: Now you papists that be from the Light, and all your crosses, and your images, and crucifixes and your likeness of Male and Female; for you that be from the light, your woship is in the will, and your humility feigned, and your righteousnes is self: he that is from the Light, is from Christ, Gods Righteousness: Now the power of God, which is the cross of Christ overthrows the ground upon which you stand, your Foundation it overthrows, as it did and doth the heathenish Foundation, from which all their images rise; so it
doth your foundation from whence your crosses and images rise: The power of God, which is the cross of Christ, overthrows your grounds, root and branches; which cross is the power of God, foolishness to you that perish, that overthrows you, to you that is foolishness; but to them that are saved it is the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, is a living cross, which to you is foolishness, who are dead, and whose cross∣es are dead, and a top of you all, and reaches over you, and compre∣hends you, and fathoms you, and shuts you out, and the powers of God is stronger then you all, and able to deal with you all; yea, all your might and strength is nothing to it, neither are you to be compared to it, for the God of glory is risen, the King of Saints is come, who will reign, his cross is born, which cross overthrows your root, and turns you by the root, and the ground upon which you stand; and this is the cross the Saints dwell in, the power of God; and him that hath not the power of God hath not the cross of Christ, and God is exalting the cross of Christ, which is his power, and your root shall be turned up, your inside shall be seen, and you shall be seen what you are, and ap∣pear in your own likeness, in your image, and shall see that you have worshipped the works of your own hands, your own likenesses, your own images and crosses, and you can be no longer hid, the light is ri∣sen which you be from, which manifests your ground and foundation, against whom it is turned, and from it you cannot be hid, but manifest you are, and you are sticks gathered for the fire; the cross of Chrst, which is the living cross, is set over your ground, and overthrows it, out of which all your crosses be invented and risen, and overthrows your wis∣dom; and that which hath invented all pictures and likenesses, the pow∣er of God in flames of fire is coming against them, and the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, overthrows them all, and will be ex∣alted; Glory be to him for ever, who sits now in his Throne, and the briars and thorns shall not stand now in battel against him, for the glo∣ry of the Lord is risen, and his power manifested, which is Christs cross, in which is our joy and glory; we glory in nothing, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is the power of God; and here we glory in the living power of God, which is the living cross: Now is God exalting the cross of Christ, which will overthrow the foundation of your church; for your Church being from the same nature and ground that imitates images, dead crosses, and likenesses, the same ga∣thers members to the Church, which is all out of the Light, and from it, and contrary to it: So the Light manifests your ground, your ga∣therings, having got the form of godliness, in that nature which is the light, not the power, for had you the power, it would crucifie you to the world, for it overthrows that nature out of which ground your Church doth arise, and your Teachers, and their ground, and your Priests, the cross doth, which is living, and the ground of your crosses,
and your supremacie that guards your Church, and your authority o∣ver your Church, that which gives pardon, as you call it, the power of God overthrows your church, your authority, your power which guards it, and your forgiveness in it, and the pardoner; that power which in∣vents the dead crosses, is in the dark, worshipping the works of its own hands, which the power of God overthrows, root and branch, and over∣throws all this; you shall witness at the last the power of God to be the cross of Christ; and unto all you this is the word of the Lord: The e∣verlasting power of God will bruise you, will overturn you top to bot∣tom, and crush you, and let you see you are helpless; the living power of God is manifest, which is dreadful to you all that from the light have been, in your own imitations, dead crosses, dead images, dead likenesses, and God will not spare you, but with the children of Light you are seen, your ground, your root, your foundation, how you have come in, what bottom and what steps in those (as I said before) that know not God, who made unto themselves dead Gods, which could nei∣ther hear nor see; so you which know not the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, have made unto your selves dead crosses, and know not his image, therefore have made dead images; and know not his Name, and so call upon names; and know not the true church where the living stones are; and know not the true Way, but set up your own inventions; now the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, is come to overthrow all ye, your ground which your crosses rise out of, which is briary and thorny, and know not his image, therefore have made dead images, and which have not known the true humility, but have gotten the feigned, which arises out of that ground which the crosses arises out of, in which lodges the murderer and persecution, and have not known the Light which comes from Christ, Gods Righteous∣ness, so be in your own righteousness; but now the Power of God is risen in his power, and manifests his power and majesty, and manifests him∣self to his Saints, and his Name is with us, and his Righteousness we know, who are to his cross obedient, and the true humility we know, the worship of God in spirit we know; the Church we know, which is the Pillar and ground of Truth; the gospel we know, which is the pow∣er of God; and the Offering we know, which perfects for ever them that are sanctified, which need not have a Purgat after death: The cross of Christ we know, which is the power of God  them that are saved; which power of God, which is the cross of Christ, ds you, and chains you; and that Faith, which is the gift of God, we ow, which gives the victory over the world, which purifies the heart, and gives to see him who is invisible; and the Ministers of God, we know, which have recei∣ved their gifts from God, which gifts are perfect, which Ministry is for the perfecting the Saints, which Ministers that which is perfect; and the Scriptures we know, with the Spirit that gave them forth to be belie∣ved,
read, and fulfilled, and now they come to be read with that spirit that gave them forth, and believed and fulfilled; that which the Pro∣phets have spoken comes to be fulfilled, and the Apostles, and the Son; Glory, Glory be unto the Lord God for ever, who is exalting his King∣dom above all the Thrones of the earth, and Dominions; and you be∣fore mentioned Papists, God will confound your wisdom, and confound your ground and your church out of which all is risen, overturn it, and overwhelm it with the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, and lay it low, and waste as a field: Now the way for you all to know the true Christ, which leads you from death, to the lively hope, I shall show: I am the light of the world, and doth inlighten every one that cometh into the world, saith Christ, him by whom the world was made: Now e∣very one of you being come into the world, having a light from him who is not of the world, this light changeth not; as all your mindes comes to be guided with this light, & love the light, & receive it, it will bring your mindes out of the earth, for minding earthly things, and inventing the earthly crosses, and such dead things, and earthly things: now loving this light, and minding it, you come to receive power from him, from Christ from whence it comes; yea, the power of God, which is the cross of Christ, which Light cometh from Christ the power of God, the wisdom of God, him by whom the world was made before it was made; this Light will let you see your own wisdom, with which you do not know the living God, which is earthly, censual, and devil∣lish; where is peevishness, and devillishness, [mark] and [minde] mur∣der and destroying: Mark and consider your fruits; now the Light which comes from Christ the wisdom of God, which will let you see sin and evil, which the fear of God is to depart from it, and then the heart comes to be kept clean; for here is the beginning of this wisdom from above, which is the path the Lions Whelp sees not, treads not, the vulturous eye sees not, the venemous beast comes not into it, gold nor silver, nor the precious pearls cannot purchase it; yea, it is hid from all the eyes living; the Sea saith it is not in me; and the Depth saith, It is not in me; where is it to be found, seeing it is hid from all the eyes living? The fear of the Lord is the be∣ginning of this wisdom, and the fear of the Lord is to depart from evil; that which brings to depart from sin, and to depart from evil, is the light which comes from Christ the wisdom of God, which light lets see it; with which light you see the sin which is to be departed from; and the evil being departed from, the wisdom that is censual, earthly and de∣villish is departed from, in which wisdom is all the Lions Whelps, and venemous beasts, and fowls of the air; out of which ariseth that which invents the earthly cross: And such as be earthly, or censual, that would give gold or silver to purchase this wisdom, but it is hid from their eyes, and all eyes living; which wisdom the fear of the Lord is the beginning of which is to depart from all sin and evil, where the secrets of God
comes to be received, and the wisdome of God Christ Jesus, and here the power of God comes to be received, waiting in the light, which is the cross of Christ, which power of God brings to witness the second Priesthood the everlasting Priesthoood, yea those that comes to witness the cross of Christ the gower of God, shall come to witness their bodies the temples of God, whch temple is holy, and thousands are come to witness this; which cross of Christ, which is the power of God, and is a base contemptible thing in the world, by the wisdome of the world, who be in their own inventions, and know but the form of godliness without the power; this cross of Christ the power of God shall over∣throw all, and stand over all, foolishness to them that perish, but the power of God to them that are saved, 1 Cor. 1.18. And the power of God which is the cross of Christ, is coming forth a dread among you all, which shall overthrow you all, root and branch, crosses and likenesses, churches and dominions, the power of God is endless, and its dominion without time, over all, that crucifies them that be in this cross from all the world, to live to him out of all dead crosses, and images; which cross which is the power of God, overturns all the foundation, out of which they arise, and buries them all, and over all it is exalted; the power of God which is the cross of Christ, glory be to him for ever, who is bringing to light the secrets of every mans heart, and his works, and judging them by the man Christ Iesus, and in the cross of Christ do the Saints magnifie the Lord, and in the cross glory, and in the cross triumph, which is the power of God, and them that are in the cross are in his power, and in his arm; so you that have been in your own crosses, which you have invented, you have your old garments on, your night-robes, that which doth make you manifest is light, and discovers you, which to crosses have bended and bowed, and to outward names, and things, for that which goes to consecrate the creatures, which are pure, made clean by the word, is that which is not pure, but defiles that which is pure, which is to be overthrown, and with the light condemned; but now the power of God which is the cross of Christ shall make you bow and bend, and overthrow you, which power breaks the covenants with death, hell, and the grave, for that nature which invents the crosses, and the ima∣ges which is from the light, that same is a place for dragons, and the serpents, the devourers, the murderers, that would murder, bloody, wicked, and desperate, that is that which was in the heathen in the days of old, which bowed to a dead God, and warred against them that ser∣ved the living God, as you bovv to the dead crosses, and war against them that are in the living cross the power of God; so that in the par∣ticular, then, and now, in you and them, prisoned and prisons the just in the particular, that ward against the just in the general, but now the
power of God is manifest, which overthrowes your ground and root, which will break open the prison-doors, and overthrow the founder of the images, and the founder of the crosses, and the founder of your churches, yea and death, and him that hath the power of death, which is the Devil, out of which death is all your dead crosses risen, the power of God is manifest, and Christ is come to reign that destroyes the works of the Devil; him who through death destroyes death, and him that hath the power of death the murderer, the destroyer, the devill out of the light, out of the truth, that abode not in it, so such as follow Christ are not of the world, they follow him that is not of the world, so they that be in the cross of Christ, which is not of the world, are in that which crucifies them from the world, the lust of it, the affecti∣ons of it, that they reign over the world, and the god of the world, and the deceivers of the world, which blindes the eyes of the infidels, and the Antichrists that be in the world, and the false teachers, they that be in the cross, the power of God overthrowes the ground, the root of them all, yea and the power by which they stand, which is of him who is out of the truth, the light, and the principalities, and the powers of darkness, and the powers of darkness, and spirituall wickedness in high places, the power of God which is the cross of Christ, overthrowes the ground and root of all these, and their knowledge, and their wisdome, which perverts from the way, which is Christ the light, whose cross is now witnessed, glory be to the Lord for ever, and they that be here are not alone. And this is the Thunder upon you Papists, they utter their voices, and upon you the hail-stones is falling, and to you the trumpet is sounded, and against you the sword is drawn and turned, furbush∣ed fit to slay, and against you the fire is kindled, and amongst you it hath been your principle to kill hereticks, when you have been the hereticks your selves from Christs doctrine, who saith, Love your enemies, and render to no man evill, saith Christ, for evill; but contrariwise, this shewes a contrary spirit that differs from the evill, which your fruits do not differ, so with the light are condemned to the fire, which be out of the truth, the image perisheth, and the founder of the image perisheth, the crosses perisheth, and the foun∣der of them perisheth, (which the cross of Christ perisheth not,) their images and crosses will rot, which the cross of Christ will not, and if you do alledge and say, That images and likenesses was set upon the temple which Solomon was commanded to build; my Answer is this, A greater then Solomon is here, that builded the temple, Christ, who said unto his Disciples, when they came unto him upon the Mount of Olives, that the temple should be thrown down, not one stone left upon another, and such as in Christ did believe a greater then Solomon, their bodies became the temples of the Holy Ghost.
That which believes not in the light, which lighteth e∣ry man that comes into the world, by whom the world was made, is yet in the dark, and not in the truth; and that which is from the light and reigns is death, and sets up that which is visible, and to it that bowes unto, and that is the murderer that is out of the light, out of the truth, and is ignorant of the Wor∣ship of God in the spirit, and in the truth, and that is it which is out of truth, from the light, which worships that which is set up which is visible, a likeness, and with it that seeks to murder him that is in the light, and is in the truth, who with it, the light and the truth, doth the other compre∣hend, and hath an image and likeness set up in his minde. That which is out of the light, and stands up, is out of the truth, that sets up that which is visible, and bowes down to that, that is death, which reigns, which is out of the light, out of the truth, and all that be in the light, which cannot bow down to that which he hath set up, which is out of the light, he that is out of the light would murther, he that is out of the light in the particular, would murther him that walks in the light in the general.
QUERIES. Quaery 1. ANd to all you Papists a Quaerie, & Rulers, & Powers, and Dominions, Priests and peo∣ple, who calls your selves Defenders of the Faith; how can you be defenders of the Faith, when that your Faith doth not defend your selves from the devil, and give you victory over the World, nor doth pu∣rifie you, but after death you must have a Purgato∣ry to be purified in; is it not manifest that you to the Faith are reprobate, which the Faith of Gods Elect gives them victory over the World, and pu∣rifies them. And you Papists, How can you give the Title of holiness to the Pope, when he and you after death look for a Purgatorie to be cleansed from Sin, and be∣fore death being unholy, therefore to that is not the holiness which is not holy, which must be cleansed after death in a Purgatory from the Sin, therefore you to say his holiness to the Pope, is a lye, who after death must have a Purgatory to be clensed from Sin; but for you to say to his Unholiness, who after death must have a Purgatory to be cleansed in, is to speak truth: And to you this is the Word of the Lord.
Quaery 2. If the Wine be the Blood of Christ, and the Bread be the Body of Christ, after consecration, and yet that Blood not cleansing you from sin, and that bread the Body of Christ, as you say, not ma∣king you free from the Law, but yet you must have a Purgatory after death to be clensed in from your sins, which here it shews that your bread is not the body of Christ which makes free from the Law, and your wine is not his blood which makes clean from all Sin, which must have a Purgatory after death to be clensed in from Sin, for the Body of Christ doth make free from the Law, and the precious blood of Christ doth clense from all Sin, as the Scripture saith, and them that are sancti∣fied are perfected for ever by the one Offering; here as you differ from the cross of Christ, which is the power of God, you differ from the blood of Christ; and as you know not the cross of Christ, you know not the blood of Christ, nor his body, which makes free from the Law, nor the one Of∣fering, which perfected for ever them that are san∣ctified; (mark) for ever. Quaery 3. And is not the blood of your own making, and the body of Christ of your own making, and is it not an element after it is consecrated, and then beg∣gerly that which clenseth man from sin, hath man
any hand in it, in consecrating it. Quaery 4. Whether bread and wine after it is consecrated, will not corrupt, which you call the body and blood of Christ? And whether man vvill not die after he hath eat and drank of it, vvhich Christ saith dyeth not that eats his body, and drinks his blood; and vvhether the Holy One doth see corruption, and his soul left in hel, and grave, and vvhether the blood and the body of Christ be an element, and vvill cor∣rupt, yea or nay? (for an element vvil;) the corrup∣tible blood of bulls and goats is not possible to take avvay sin; but the precious blood of the Sonne of God vvasheth avvay the sin, and except ye eat my flesh, and drink my blood, yee have no life in me; so the life of Christ is out of the corruptible, out of the ele∣ment, feeding upon the elements, and the corrup∣tible, keeps you from the light of Christ; here in all this do you not differ from the blood of Christ, vvhich gives life in Christ, vvhich blood the Apostle speaks, clenseth from all sin. Quaery 5. Whether is not Christ the substance of the figures and shadovves, yea or nay? Quaery 6. And if the mind be guided vvith the light, from vvhence the light comes up to Christ, to see and re∣ceive him, vvhether doth not this lead the mind out
of all things that doth change, and hath an end, yea or nay, to see him that doth not change, vvhere there is no shadovv. Quaery 7. And if the Wine and Bread after consecration be the very blood and body of Christ, and if he hath no other body then that, vvhether you do look for a Christ that is to come, yea or nay? and if so, vvhe∣ther he hath a body besides your Bread and Wine after consecration. Quaery 8. And whether Bread and Wine is not of that which is below after it is consecrated; and whether it be that bread that said, I am that bread that came down from above, he that eateth this bread, and drink∣eth my blood hath life in me, and shall never die, and ex∣cept you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no life in me. Quaery 9. Whether Bread after consecration be the Flesh of Christ, or not? Quaery 10. And where did the Apostle give any command that the people should observe dayes with meats? Or, where did he give any command that a cross should be made in remembrance of Christ, or an Image; or that they should pray to any of the Saints? or, where had the Apostles any Organs? Quaery 11. Is Christ without a body? hath he a body besides
the bread and wine, which you call the body after consecration, and blood, yea, or nay? Quaery 12. Is Christ to be looked for to be in the Saints? Quaery 13. Is not a Cross, made of silver, stone, or wood, a dead Idol? Quaery 14. Is not an Image, made of stone, or wood, a dead Idol? Quaery 15. Is not a Crucifix a dead Idol? Are not Images that are made with mens hands, dead idols? Quaery 16. Did not the heathen worship dead idols? and were they not made with their owne hands? and are not your Images, Crosses, Crucifixes, likenes∣ses made with your own hands, dead idols having no breath in them? And wherein do you differ from the Heathen, who fall down to the worke of your owne hands, as the Heathen did, which fell down to the work of their own hands the dead i∣dols? So the cross of Christ you know not. This is to be delivered to the Pope, Priests, Jesuits, and all them who be popishly affected, and have the Popish af∣fections, which they being from the light, and the rest from the light, and seen with the light from the children of light, which be in the power of God, the cross of Christ, and given forth by me, as I was moved of the Lord to give it forth, seeing their ground was from the light, who is called of the world. George Fox. THE END.
