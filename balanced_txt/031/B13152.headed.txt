And for the more due and just execution of the Premisses, His Majestie by His said Letters Patents, hath authorized the Bailiffs, Wardens, and Assistants of the Weavers of London, from time to time to appoint meet persons skilfull in the said Art of Weaving, to view and search all Silks and Stuffs of what breadth soever made, of forrain, or part forrain Mate∣rials, by any person or persons in England or Wales; and upon due triall had of the said Manu∣factures (they being found of just breadths, and made of right and unfalsified Materials, and being truly Wrought and Woven, to Seal with the severall Stamps or Seals hereafter na∣med, appointed for that purpose, (which His Majestie commands that none presume to counter∣feit:) all such Stuffs (above a quarter of a yard broad) as they shall finde good and Mer∣chantable, and to reject and forbear to Seal the contrary, but to seize and take them into their custody to be defaced or destroyed, and the Makers thereof to be further punished according to their offences. Wherefore His Majestie doth hereby further straitly charge and command, that all Tishews, Gold or Silver Stuffs, and all other Silks and Stuffs (above one quarter of a yard broad) to be made of forrain, or part forrain Materials, within the Cities of London and Westminster, or within five miles of either of them, after the Feast day of All Saints next ensuing, shall be brought to the common Hall of the said Company of Weavers within the City of London, to be there Viewed, Searched, and Sealed by the sworn Officer or Officers appointed, and to be appoint∣ed in that behalf, without any Fee to be taken for the same; And that all such other of the said Stuffs as shall be Made, or Wrought in any other parts or places of the Realm of England

And for reforming a great abuse now used in the making of Ribands and Laces, by the help of an Engine called a great Loom, where∣in one person alone will make as much work (though in a false and deceitfull manner) as ten persons can do in single Looms in the like time, to the hinderance and undoing of many of His Majesties people of the said Trade; His Majestie therefore doth charge and command, That no person or persons whatsoever, from and after the Feast of the Birth of Our Lord God next coming, shall work in, use, or exercise any such Frame or Engine, called A great Loom, or any other Frame or Engine, wherein there shall be made or wrought any more Laces or Ribands of any sort then only one at one and the same time, upon pain of His Majesties heavy displeasure, and such punishments as shall be meet to be inflicted upon the Offenders for their contempts herein: And that no person or persons, shall privately, or by way of Hawking, carry any Silks, or Stuffs, Garters, Ribands, Laces, or other Manufactures made of forrain, or part forrain Materials, broad or narrow, to private mens houses, or Innes, within the Cities of London & Westminster, or the Suburbs or Liberties of the same, to vend or put to sale, nor shall proffer the same to sale to people as they passe in the Streets, upon pain of the losse and forfeiture of all such Manufactures as shall be so offered to sale, by the way of Hawking, as aforesaid.

And as concerning the present Tradesmen and Artificers in the Art of Weaving, of forrain, or part forrain Materials, His Majestie hath by His said Letters Patents ordained and declared, That the said Bailiffs, Wardens, and Assistants shall and may receive and admit into the said Cor∣poration to exercise the said Trade, such competent number of fit persons, as to them in their discretions shall seem meet and convenient, being naturall born Subjects, Denizens, or Stran∣gers, who have exercised the said Trade here one whole yeer at the least, before the date of the said Letters Patents, and are conformable to the Laws of the Realm, and Constitutions of the Church of England: And that from and after two yeers next following, they shall not ad∣mit into the said Corporation, any persons to exercise the said Trade of Weaving of forrain, or part forrain Materials, unlesse he or they have served seven yeers to the said Trade, within the said Corporation. And to this His Majesties declaration of His Royall will and pleasur
the Premisses (tending to the common good of His Subjects) His Majestie requireth all due confor∣mity of all such whom it shall concern, upon pain of His Majesties high displeasure, and as they will answer for their neglects or contempts herein. And to the end that it may be certainly known what Silks or Stuffs made in forrain parts, shall from time to time be imported into the Kingdom, And whether the same shall be made and wrought of their true breadths, and right Materials, according to His Majesties directions for those that shall be made here, His Majesties pleasure is to appoint a speciall Officer for Searching and Sealing of all such Silks and Stuffs, as from the said Feast of All Saints next shall be imported into the Realm of England and Dominion of Wales from forrain parts.

And His Majestie being informed of a great deceit now used in the mixing of Worsted with Gro∣geran Yarn in Tamets, Parragons, and other like Stuffs, doth therefore hereby further charge and command, That from and after the Feast of the Birth of Our Lord God next coming, no per∣son or persons whatsoever, shall Make or Weave within the Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales, nor shall import into the same from forrain parts, any Tamets, Parragons, or other Stuffs made of Grogeran Yarn, wherin there shall be Woven or mixed any Worsted whatsoever, upon pain of the seizure and forfeiture of the same, and such other penalties and punishments as shall be meet to be inflicted for their contempts herein.
