THE CASE OF THE Makers of Vinegar. IN the Bill for an Additional Duty of Excise, there is a New Duty laid upon Vinegar, or Liquors prepared for Vinegar, which Duty so laid, will prevent the making of Vinegar in England: For that the Liquor for making of Vinegar is drawn off from one Cask to another several times in a day, for Two Months together, and more, with great waste; So that to take an Accompt thereof, the Officer must always continue in the Makers House, by which means the Makers will be forced to shew their Art to every Officer; and the burthen will be so great upon them, that they will not be able to follow their Trade: But if any persons do continue to make Vinegar, the Charge to Their Majesties, to take an Accompt, will in probability be as much as the Duty. There never was any attempt to lay a Duty upon Liquor preâˆ£pared for Vinegar, nor was there a Duty ever laid upon Vinegar when made, because the Materials used to make the same, Pays a great Duty to Their Majesties. The Makers of Vinegar Use Eager-Wine, Lees of Wine, and Beer Brewed purposely by the Common Brewer. Wine, when Imported, Pays a great Duty, and Eager-Wine is fit for no other Use but to make Vinegar; and if the Merchant cannot Sell his Eager-Wine here, he will Export the same, and draw back near half the Duty, which will very much lessen Their Majesties Revenue. All which the Makers of Vinegar are ready to make appear.
