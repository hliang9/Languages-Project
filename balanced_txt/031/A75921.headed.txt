ADVICE TO GEN. MONCK: By a Friend that wisheth his Happiness. NOW George for England, that brave Warrior bold, That would not be by Lambert's force controul'd; But did endeavour for the good o'th' Nation, We hope to work a blessed Reformation, And settle Kingly Power in this Dominion, And then thou shalt be great in the Opinion Of all good people that do fear the Lord, And then no doubt they will with thee accord, And say, Long live brave George in Wealth and Peace, Bless thee with Honors, Plenty and Increase. And may thy Name for ever be Inroll'd In Characters of pure refined Gold, Which hath stood up still for thy Countries good, Preserv'd the Laws, and sav'd the peoples blood From being spilt, O happy sure art thee, And wilt be made a man of high degree: For by experience see what is become Of Oliver the great, Richard his son, Who held unjustly their True Princes right, They'r now Obscure, their day is turn'd to Night. Whereas a Conscience good, void of offence, At last is sure to have good recompence, To live in gloty in the life to come, When other have a Sad and Fatal Doom. From which God bless George Monck, and his Namesake. Who in his praise these Lines did undertake. FINIS.
