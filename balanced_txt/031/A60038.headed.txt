With a Remarkable Account of some others of the Perse∣cutors of the same People in the same Island. Together with an Abstract of their Sufferings. LONDON, Printed and Sold by T. Sowle, near the Meeting-house in White-hart-court in Gracious-street. 1696.
A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE Manifest Hand of God That hath Fallen upon Several Marshals AND Their Deputies. &c. Samuel Buckley A Rapacious and greedy Marshall sometimes taking ten times the value of his Demand saying that the Overplus he would keep until the Fines had eaten it out, as if thereby he would inrich himself; yet not with standing at several times he took from the aforesaid people to the value of Four and twenty thousand Pounds of Mus∣covado-Sugar; at lastly about the year 1660 was fored to
run off the Island for Debt; and at Jamaica in a short time after died of a Timpany, and stoppage of Water, having not wherewithal to bury him, but something from the Alms of the People. Thomas Parry, Another Marshal, having taken to the value of Four thousand pounds of Muscovado-Sugar from the said People, about the year 1665, was seized with such a noisome Di∣stemper, that where he lived Vessels were provided for him to eat and drink by himself; and in that condition he lan∣guished for a time, and then died after a very strange man∣ner▪ For in the morning he eat as at other times, and went into his room, where he laid himself cross a stool, and was found dead, with a great quantity of Blood under him. John Godfrey, Marshal to Colonel Simon Lambert's Regiment of Horse, as he was Executing a Warrant, and taking away Goods from the People aforesaid, because they could not for Con∣science sake send nor appear to learn War, (which hath been their ancient Testimony from the beginning) the same day one of his children, amongst many other Children at School was struck dead by Thunder; and he himself, not∣withstanding all his ill-gotten Goods, amounting to about Two and twenty thousand Pounds of Muscovado-Sugar, taken away by him and his Deputy John Clun, from the Year 1667, to the year 1670; went off the Island for Debt.
Walcup Dangerfield, A Marshal to Colonel Baily, and no ways inferiour to his Predecessors in wickedness, was suffered a while, from the year 1668, to the year 1672, to make spoil of the said Peoples Endeavours; but going for England, to see after something fallen to him there, at Sea drinking very hard, and uttering many blasphemous Speeches in his Cups, was soon after found dead in his Cabbin, as supposed to be sti∣fled in his own Vomit. William Clearke, Another Marshal, by a Fall from his Horse was so brui∣sed, that his Body mortified in a miserable manner, and he died a Spectacle of Horror (who in the year 1669, was busi∣ly concerned in taking away of the said Peoples Goods) and it is credibly reported that he had above forty Pledgets used every dressing; and yet by the said People was relieved in his greatest necessity. Phillip Morgan, Marshal to Colonel Timothy Thornehill the Elder, about the year 1670, having taken away a considerable parcel of Goods from the said People, yet died very poor, and was relieved by the Parish, notwithstanding also that he had a good Estate by his Wife, yet all consumed, and his Chil∣dren came to be maintained by the Parish. Alexander Hancocke, Notwithstanding he had a good Employment, which was
the Practice of Chirurgery, whereby he might have got a commendable Livelihood, yet for unrighteous Gain, took up this Employment of a Marshal, under Colonel Richard Baily, and after having in the year 1670, and 1671, wasted and destroyed much of the Goods of the said People, died very poor, and leaving his Children to be maintain'd by others. Thomas Warrin, Marshal to Colonel Simon Lambert, with his Deputy William White-Church, after they had taken away from the said People, from the year 1670, to the year 1681, to the value of One hundred thousand pounds of Muscovado Su∣gar, yet died very poor, and had not of their own to re∣lieve them in their sickness, nor to bury them. Thomas Forrister, An eminently wicked and rapacious Marshal, who held the place about fourteen or fifteen years, at times, in which he took from the aforesaid People to the value of two thou∣sand one hundred seventy five pounds sterling, besides many considerable Sums not brought in, and all for account of the Militia, who in levying his Executions was very abusive; who some years before his Death, on a sick Bed, pretended he prayed to God to shew him if he had committed any Evil in taking away the Quakers Goods, and that he was in a kind of a Trance, assured by a small Voice like a Child's, (which he believed to be God, or Jesus Christ) encouraged to go on in his Practice; and this he would often repeat, when he was executing his wicked Office, scoffingly: Not long after, the Lord visited him again with a languishing Di∣stemper, of which he died: He was a horrible Swearer, and taken in Adultery by his own Wife. He died very poor; his
Wife and Children also soon died after him; who were fain to be Relieved and Buried at the Charge of others, to the Admiration of many, how such vast Sums could be Con∣sumed. Charles Clinton, Son-in-Law to this abovesaid Marshal, turned Marshal, and followed his Father's Footsteps; but what he took after this manner prospered not, so that he soon run away in a small Fishing-boat much in Debt, Cursing his Father-in-Law for perswading him to that Imployment. Jonathan Scarborough, Marshal, a very Wicked and Abusive Man, both in Language, Gesture and Behaviour, after having taken to the Value upwards of Seventeen Thousand Pounds of Mus∣covado Sugar, between the Years 1672, and the Year 1675, was forced to run off the Island for Debt, and in a short time after Died at the Leeward Islands very Poor. Daniel Leech, Marshal to Colonel Richard Baily, having taken away Goods from the said People, was Troubled and Convicted in his Conscience, as he Confessed himself, upon which he laid down his Place, having an Estate of his own, and a good Trade besides; yet afterwards took up that same Place again, under Colonel John Sampson, and made a greater Spoil of the said Peoples Goods, taking away upwards of Twelve Thousand Pounds of Muscovado Sugar; but after all, Died very Poor and Miserable, and in Debt.
Thomas Stronee, Marshal to the abovesaid Colonel Baily, when he had taken Considerable quantities of Goods in the Years 1673, and 1674, from the said People, Died in a very Miserable Condition, and under Convictions of Conscience. Thomas Caudle, Marshal to Colonel John Waterman, a very Bad and Wicked Man, who took away great quantities of Goods from the said People, also exceeding the Law (which was severe enough) altering the Colonels Execution to his own Ungodly Advantage; and though he got much Goods this way, yet a Curse fell upon his Endeavours, and he Died ve∣ry Poor, notwithstanding he had another Employment, which was, to Gather the Priest's Wages, and for that made Spoil also, both being from between the Years 1673, and 1679; he was also Clark of the Parish, yet was Relieved by some of the said People before he Died. John Batt, Junior, Marshal to Colonel Thornehill, having in the Years 1675, and 1677, taken Considerable from the said People, was afterward visited by the Lord, and upon his Death-bed made to give forth these following Lines. Whereas I John Batt the Younger, of the Island of Barba∣does, was lately by Commission from Colonel Thornehill, Mar∣shal to his Regiment of Foot-Soldiers, and by that Power did Distrain upon the Estates of several of the People called Quakers, and took, and carried away many Parcels of their Sugar, and o∣ther
Goods, for their Defaults in not appearing in Arms in the said Regiment, which they refused out of Tenderness of Consci∣ence, to which I had not regard; but now the Lord having laid his Hand sorely on me, by afflicting me with a hard and grievous Sickness, those things done to the aforesaid People comes fresh in my Mind to my very great Grief and Terror, and I do declare, that all the Sins that I have been Guilty of besides (which are very many) do not trouble or lye so heavy on my Conscience, as that my doings to that People; and do believe that no Man will ever be Blessed, or Prosper, that practice such things against that People: In witness whereof I have hereunto set my Hand this Tenth Day of May, 1679. Witness: William Howard, Antrobus. John Batt, Jun. William St. Barbe, Marshal to Colonel Bayly, he so exceeded the Law, that the Colonel was often forced to threaten him, calling him Rogue, and forcing him to return Goods again Illegally ta∣ken away; he took from a very poor Man his Feather-bed for Fifty Pounds of Muscovado Sugar, for not appearing in Arms, the Blanket being Appraised at the Sum; who was suffered to spoil and carry away Goods to the Value of up∣wards of Twelve Thousand Pounds of Muscovado Sugar from the said People; yet he has often been glad of a Meals Meat since from the said People. Samuel Hopkins, Marshal to Colonel Timothy Thornehill the Elder, having taken away large quantities of Goods from the said People, yet what he took prospered not, for he spent much in a ve∣ry
wicked manner, and then run away with another Mans Wife, (though he had one of his own) and in Virginia he miserably ended his days, according to Credible Informa∣tion. William Thomas, Deputy to Leech, Marshal to Colonel Richard Bayly, act∣ing very wickedly, carrying away much of the said Peoples Goods, from the Year 1679, to the Year 1683; but after∣ward Died very miserable, wanting a Meals-meat, and had not Linnen to make him a Shroud, as his Wife reported. Robert Fitzherbert, A great Troubler of the Innocent People aforesaid, who from the Year 1681, to the Year 1686, made great waste of their Substance, amounting to upwards of one Hundred and Twenty Thousand Pounds of Muscovado Sugar, and one Hundred and Twenty Pounds Sterling, which with Honesty and Industry they had gotten; a great deal he car∣ried away without Law; the Colonel, Samuel Newton, took care to redress them, and for Attempting it, was by the Complaint of Fitzherbert, severely reprehended by Ri∣chard Dutton, then Governor, and it is said, of a Kin to the said Fitzherbert: (he went off this Island, not having wherewith to pay his passage) but some time before, a Complaint being made for his Illegal Proceedings to Colo∣nel Buckley, the said Buckley turned him out of his Marshals Place,
Benjamin Carteritt Marshal, after having taken away from the aforesaid People Goods to the Value of Seventeen Thousand Pounds of Muscovado Sugar, about the Year 1682, and after ha∣ving taken away one Cow, and one Heifer, from one of the said People, being a Widow-woman, died immediately af∣terward very suddenly, crying out of a great Fire burning within him, and going to a Jugg of Cool Drink to quench his Thirst or Heat, fell down and died, to the great Af∣frightment of some present; seeming as if it was a Just re∣compence of Reward for his Unjust and Illegal Dealings, and his great Debaucheries and Excess. John Nobbs, Marshal to Colonel Alexander Ruddock, having for seve∣ral Years together carried away much of the aforesaid Peo∣ples Goods, by which Place, and by his being Marshal, and Crier to a Court of Common-Pleas at once, his In∣comes was great; but in the midst of his Gettings, he run Distracted Mad: He had Six Negroes at once, besides Cat∣tel, and other Stock; one of his Negroes, when in that Condition, he was the Death of, by Cruel Usage; and ano∣ther he run through the Thigh with a Sword, and he Died soon after, as also all the rest, with Cattel, and other Stock; and so continued Raving Mad, breaking and throw∣ing every thing he could lay his hands on, and often Con∣triving what he should get for the Judges Dinner, for which, at one time he was going to Cut a piece out of his Horses Buttocks for the Judges better Entertainment, but was hindred, and still continued Mad; insomuch that he was forced to leave all his Offices, he not being in a Condition
to follow it any longer, and Lives Miserable and Poor. And one John Redaway, that used to Buy such Goods as the said Nobbs carried from his Neighbours, did not prosper, but an Estate that his Father left him, and upon which he might have Lived Comfortably, wasted strangely away. James Harris, Who was for some time Marshal to Colonel Abel Allen, a very moderate man, Executed his Office with great Ri∣gour, often exceeding the Law, to the Trouble of the said Colonel, who often made him return the Effects; till at last being turned out of his Place, was reduced to great Penury and Want, being often troubled with Fits, so that People where he used were weary of his Society, which made him complain, that where he had spent his Money, they would not give him a Bit of Bread in his Extremity; he soon after Died in great Rage and Discontent. William Hawes, Marshal to Colonel Timothy Thornehill the Younger, he also took great quantities of Goods from the aforesaid Peo∣ple, for not appearing in Arms, for which, in one Day, there was Returns made in the said Thornehill's Regiment, as the said Hawes himself boasted, to the Value of above Twenty Thousand Pounds of Sugar; and although he had gotten much Wealth (according to the promise made him by the said Thornehill, who made him his Marshal) by this and his Marshals place of Common pleas, being also Col∣lector of the Parish for the Priest-hire, yet he prospered not, but decayed both in Body and Goods, being a long time Afflicted with that Miserable Distemper called the Belly-Ach, until he had almost lost the use of his Limbs;
his Wife also, by whom he had had several Bastard Chil∣dren, left him in his Extremity; and he being without means or hopes of outward Subsistance in this Island, in∣tended off for New-York, hoping for Relief by the Charity of a Sister he had there; and in order thereto, according to the Custom of this Island, did put up his Name in the Se∣cretary's Office, but was under-writ for the Sum of Seven Pounds, which neither his Master's, (whose Drudgery he had done) nor his own Purse, could or would procure that Sum; so that he being therein disappointed, was glad to go from House to House, till in some short time after he Died very Poor and Miserable; and had not the fear of Of∣fence to the Living given him a Burial, more than the Good-will of his Friends, or Ability of his Purse, he might have remained Unburied as a further Warning to others. Durant Alsop, Marshal to Colonel John Farmer, (and a profest Papist) who after great Havock made of those Industrious Peoples Labours, about the Year 1685, taking away above Thirty Pounds Sterling in one Day, as himself confest, yet being out of his place, was very poor and indigent. Allyn Hughson, Another Wicked Marshal, who after a great Destructi∣on in the Year 1685, and 1686, of those Peoples Estates, run away. John Thurborne, Marshal to Colonel Tidcombe, every way fitted for such an Unrighteous Undertaking, and had spent a Considera∣ble
Estate by Debauchery, and in his Want and Sickness desired Relief from the Quakers, and had it from some of them; but when he recovered his Health, basely became a Marshal in the same Regiment where he had been a Cap∣tain, and Executed the Place with great Severity, from the Year 1686, to the Year 1689, against those People that had Administred to his Necessities. He would scoffingly call the Quakers his Milch-Cows, of∣ten saying, George Gray (one of these People) was one of his best Cows, and gave a brave Mess of Milk every Exercising-Day. He came to a poor Friends House to Execute his Office, and took away a Fat Hog worth two or three times his demand, though there were smaller in sight; but under∣standing what need the poor Man had of it, for the Relief of his Family, chose rather to carry it away, that his Ra∣pine might be the greater, and threatned the poor Man, That he would make his Heart burn for Ten Weeks, and then come for Five Pounds for an Alarum, for which he took a∣way a Heifer, and two Hogs, worth Six Pound Sterling: After this manner did he prey upon these People, devour∣ing a great quantity of their Goods; yet became Miserable, and the Judgments of God pursued him, and a Fistula arose in his Fundament that would admit of no Cure, which gave him such pain and misery, that he would often Curse his Body where it was, till at last he miserably finisht his Evil Course of Life, leaving nothing to pay his Just Debts. Andrew Kenny, Marshal to Colonel Abel Allen, who though he continu∣ed not long in the place, yet Imployed his time in the Year 88, to the utmost, in carrying away the abovesaid Peo∣ples
Goods, but in the end was forced to submit to the Fate of several of his Brethren, and run away for Debt. William Meagher, An Irishman, and Deputy to John Maugrah, Marshal to Colonel Thomas Colliton, when he was taking Goods from John Tod, one of the aforesaid People, for account of the Mi∣litia, did draw his Sword, and wilfully Stab the said Tod's Overseer into his Body, so that he soon after Died of the Wound; for which Fact he was Tried, and found Guilty of Murder, yet Reprieved; and the Noise was that a Par∣don might be expected, so at last had Liberty to seek a Live∣lihood, but wasted away, and Died so miserable poor, that one of his Countrymen was forced to Bury him, having not wherewith of his own; but we never yet understood of any Pardon that ever came. Now after he had Attached Ginger from the abovesaid Tod, he would have removed his Execution, and laid it up∣on a Cow which the said Overseer would not let him do, being contrary to Law, wherefore he drew his Sword, and run it into his Body, and Kill'd him. Francis Chamberlaine, Marshal to Colonel Abel Allen, who also delighted in the Spoiling the Just-gotten Goods of those People; but he was soon called to an Account, and stopt in his Career; he was seized with a Malignant Fever, which had swept away a great number of People in that Island, between the Years 1690, and 1691, by which Fever, himself, Wife, and Sister, were all taken away in Twenty-four hours space, which struck such a Terror on his Neighbours and Relations, that none cared to come near them, not so much as a Sister of
his, whose Husband ordered their Burial, but said, He would not go into the House if it were full of Gold, but sent Negrees to carry them. It seemed terrible to him to behold his Wife and Sister dead by him; his Distemper by his Doctors was thought to be over, for he got up, and be∣holding the dead Bodies of his Wife and Sister, lay down in a Hamock, and never spoke more, which is the account of a Woman that lookt after them. Charles Lucas, Deputy-Marshal to Colonel Tobias Frere of the Wind∣ward Regiment of Foot, who after having taken away much of the Goods of the aforesaid People, was Killed by a Fall into a Well. Charles Lucas, Marshal to the aforesaid Colonel, after having made Spoil, and carried away much Goods of the aforesaid People, about the year 1694 sickned, crying out much of one that he had Killed, and of the Devil; saying to the People by him, Do you not see him? And so ended his Days wretchedly.
Here Followeth An ACCOUNT Remarkable OF The Hand of GOD Upon some other PERSECUTORS In the same ISLAND. SOme Friends in this place having considerable Quan∣tities of Negroes, who being naturally inclined to Loosness and Wickedness, in taking more Wives and Husbands than one (a Custom in their own Country) and being very ignorant, and averse to that which is good; believed it their indispensible Duty to set some time apart to labour with them, and to instruct them in the things
of God: And in order thereunto, most Friends that had Negroes set apart one hour or two once a week to in∣struct them according to their understanding, and to read the Scriptures to them, directing them to the inward Teacher, whereby they might be led out of Stealing, Murdering, Plotting, and of their Uncleanness and Adul∣tery. This Christian Practice so offended the then Autho∣rity, that a Law was made, entituled, An Act to prevent the People call'd Quakers from bringing their Negroes to their Meetings, (though it was in their own Houses) the Pe∣nalty being no less than the forfeiting of each Negroe that was found at a Meeting, or Ten pounds sterling a piece for each Negroe. Some Friends were soon prosecuted by the same Law with great violence, and large expectations of the Inform∣ers: One Thomas Cobham began, and brought an Action against Ralph Fretwell, for Eighty Negroes of his own at a Meeting in his own Family, for Eight hundred pound sterling; and also against Lewis Morris, for a very great Sum; the said Cobham being countenanced by one John Merrick, a Justice of the Peace, and an Assistant of the Court where the Actions were to be tried; and after seve∣ral Courts, Judgment was given in favour of the Defen∣dants, to the great Disappointment of the Envious, espe∣cially one Charles Collins a Lawyer, who used his utmost Skill in behalf of the Informers. But the abovesaid Thomas Cobham the Informer, who of a lusty likely young man, in a small time became dejected, being generally slighted, and his company refused by several for being an Informer; and soon after was taken with a Fever and Swelling in his Neck and Throat, which daily increased in a very strange man∣ner; so that towards his latter End, he cried out, Fire, fire, he was all on fire; and said to his Mother, She need not provide a Coffin for him, for he should be burnt up before it was made;
crying out, Neither Heaven nor Hell, but all fire, fire; and cried saying, Now the Quakers will say, It is a Judgment fal∣len on me. After this manner did this miserable man end his Days. Soon after died John Daw of a Surfeit by Drinking, who was an Instrument in this evil Work. Also, John Mackfashion, one of the Evidences, never thrived afterwards, but in a small time died of that deplorable Dis∣ease called the Belly-ake. And the aforesaid Justice, John Merrick, riding to his own House in Drink, was thrown by his Horse, to the hurt∣ing of his Brain, (though no outward appearance) who continued some few days in a violent raving condition, to the Terror of his Friends, and then died. William Sharp, an Eminent Man, and Judge of a Court, was a great Opposer of our Labour with these poor Ne∣groes; who riding from his own House to the Bridge Town, (seemingly very well) fell from his Horse before he got to the Town, and we cannot understand that he ever spake afterwards (except O my Head) and in three or four Days afterwards died. Alexander Ruddock, A Colonel of a Regiment of Foot, and Judge of a Court, and one of the Council, and of the Nation of Scot∣land: He appeared, without any just Cause, very bitter and envious against us: He caused a Friend to be rated 400 pounds of Sugar towards payment of the Priests Wages, (who never wrought for him) the Priest being his Son in-Law; for which was taken from the said Friend a Cow worth Ten Pound sterling; and upon Complaint of the said Friend, and upon Enquiry, there was but ten pounds of Su∣gar appeared to be their pretended Due: For the Poors
part, and for mending Highways, we duely pay; but this being the Priests part, he could not for Conscience pay; yet was this unjust Action vindicated by the said Ruddock, not∣withstanding some of the Magistrates that were at the hear∣ing of the matter, would have had the Cow returned to the right Owner; but because the said Friend had com∣plained of the Wrong and Oppression, he the said Ruddock being Judge of the Quarter Sessions, caused him to be fi∣ned five pounds sterling, because he could not take the Oath of a Constable (which for Conscience-sake he only refused) although he was willing to have performed the Office, ac∣cording to his Ability and Understanding, if he might have been permitted without an Oath, which several Friends had been, by moderate Magistrates, and found to perform the same honestly and diligently: For which Fine, the said Ruddock the Judge issued out his Warrant against the said Friend to a Constable, upon which was taken from him a Negroe Woman, which they had to the Constables House, where Ruddock was himself, and so ordered the matter, that the said Negroe was valued but at two thousand three hundred pounds of Sugar, which as the price of Sugar then went, might amount to 11 l. 10s. which Negroe was sold some time after for 26 l. and was all kept for the Fine of 5l. And the said Friend having suffered above Seven thousand pounds of Sugar in one year by his means, which the said Friend laid before him in the presence of his Daughter, the Priests Wife, telling him he had suffered all that for com∣plaining of the Wrong he had done him about his Cow, &c. at which he seemed greatly to rejoyce, and said it should be so yearly, so long as he was Magistrate: But he did not live a year after. He shewed his great willingness and desire to persecute Friends on all occasions; and the last time he sat in Council, and knowing there was an Order form the Gover∣nour to break up Friends Meetings, he staid after the Coun∣cil
broke up, which was late, for the Order to break up our Meeting in his Precincts, and promised the Governour di∣ligently to obey all his Commands: But calling at Judge Rees, in his way home, was taken ill; but went home, and calling for a Medicine called Cream of Tartar, which he used to take in his Broth, by his own mistake took Arse∣nick instead thereof, and so wretchedly ended his Days; which may be a Warning to others. He threatned that with the Money taken from us, there should be a Prison built for us: He would not let us eat fresh Meat, and went to take away the Meat which a Friend bought in the Market, saying he would have it, although the Butcher told him several times that he had sold it, and was receiving the Money fot it. Another Friend having bought Meat in the Market, and the Butcher carrying it to his House, was met in the way by the said Ruddock, who commanded him to carry it back into the Market, saying, They shall not eat fresh Meat; the man turned back, and durst not carry the Friend his Meat which he had bought of him. He was for putting Negroes to Death for Example, saying, What was it for Barbadoes to put twenty or thirty Negroes to Death yearly for Example-sake. He caused some Friends to be prick'd for Constables, on purpose to Fine them, saying it should be so every year. This is but a branch of his Cruelty, for he made great spoil of Friends Goods upon the Militia-Ac∣count, as he was Colonel: It is wonderful to conceive how a man should be so filled with prejudice against a Peo∣ple that never gave him any just occasion. But his mea∣sure being filled, he was cut off as before related. Priest Kenny his Country-man preach'd his Funeral Ser∣mon, and declared as followeth—That he had attained to the Prudence of a Judge, the Dignity of a Colonel, and the
Honour of a Counsellor; and that he had served his King and Countrey faithfully, and died a Saint. His Text was, I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith, &c. 2 Tim. 4.7. How this suited with his Actions, we leave the Reader the Judge. Sir Timothy Thorn hill, and Major General, (So Called) A Man who wanted not will to have taken away our Lives, as he often threatned; a Man full of wicked and blasphemous Discourse; and it may be said of him, He neither feared God nor Man, as his following Actions will declare: Being at a Feast, and drinking to excess, and some of them refusing to drink so hard, he wished himself God Almighty, that he might Damn the Souls of them that would not drink: Another time, being in company where a Wo∣man being speaking in discourse of the Power and Omni∣potency of Almighty God, he replied, God Damn ye, go to the top of yonder Tree, (pointing to a Tree near them) and tumble down, and see if God Almighty can save you from break∣ing your Neck before you come to the bottom. A Friend stand∣ing by, reprehended him for such wicked Expressions, for which he beat the Friend, calling him Son of a Whore, and asked if he were to be taught by him? A Friend being brought before him for not appearing in Arms, told him he could not for Conscience-sake; to which he replied, God Damn your Conscience; if I cannot make your Conscience bow, I'll make your stubborn Dogs Back bend; and so ty'd him Neck and Heels with his own hands, with that Violence and Rage, that almost deprived him of Life. Articles of War being published in this Island, he then swore desperately that now he had power, and would put them in Eecution, and the
first time an Enemy appeared, he would hang up the Quakers; binding his words with bitter Oaths (without which he could hardly speak.) He having been lately sick, and pret∣ty well recovered, boasted among his Companions of his Conquest over Death, and that he had taken a New Lease of his Life from God Almighty for Thirty years longer, and so continued in his Wickedness, and hath often been heard to say, He would live more in a Month, than others should in a Year. But in few months this poor Man was visited again by the hand of the Lord, and his large Measure be∣ing full, the Thread of his Life was cut asunder, notwith∣standing his New Lease; Unlamented by the moderate People of the Isd, and Curst by others, who lost con∣siderably by him; who notwithstanding a great Estate left him by his Father, died (by a moderate Caleulation) Eight thousand pounds sterling worse than nothing, as is credibly discoursed, and heavily felt by the Sufferers. THE END.
