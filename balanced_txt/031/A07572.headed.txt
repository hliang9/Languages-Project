For Sa∣lomon sayth thus to his son / ili memorare novissima tua & ineternum non pec∣bis / Sone have in thy mynd

And he hyred peo∣ple to labour by all ye tydes of the day / This is to und∣erstonde all ye-grees of ye▪ worlde / For as Iob sayth / A man is borne to labour & traveyle in thys world as a byrd to flee / And saynt Bernard sayth He that wyl not labour here in this wor∣lde / He shall labour wyth the fendis of helle. For yt, is the testament of Adam that he lefte to alle hys of sprynge / labour & trav∣eylle / To this labour he ge∣veth ensample & reherseth how god made Adam & Eve o labour to kepe pa∣radyse and bad they mete of all the frutes that was in pa∣radyse / except one tree that he kepe for hymself soo as fte as they sawe that tree / th∣ey shold thynke n hym that made theym and know him for theyr god / And for they sholde notete there of inpe∣yne of dampnacyon Thenne the fendesawe theym in soo moche Joye that they were in and hymself in soo moche peyne / And woo that he had grete envye to theym / and wente to Eve: and asked why they ete not of the frute of that tree / And she sayd god hath forbede us that tree in peyn of dethe Thenne sa∣yde the fende / he woteful well that and yeete therof / ye sholde be lyke god knowynge both good and ev∣yll / And yf yewyl prove that I say so the / ete therof and assaye.

And an anther with y∣her of them sawe others sha∣pe and were asshamed. And toke leaves afafygge tree and so evered her mem∣bres. Than come our lorde to adam ayd ▪Quarefeci∣ti hoc▪ why hast thou doo soo▪ & he sayd (Mulier quamde∣disti mich isociam) The wo∣man bad me / Thenne said our lord to eve / why didest thou this (Serpens decepit me.)

Than prayd A∣dam oure lard wepyng / he sholde not take grete venge∣aunce upon theym▪ but have mercy on theym / & pyte for they were begyled byenvy & malyce of the fende / and by innocensye of theym self that they wyst not what they dyde. Then had our lord ruthe on theym / & for they were both naked he clothed theym in pylches, & badde theym goo labour and traveyle for ther lyvyng / And sayd to Eve (In dolore paries filios) In sorrow and woo shalt thou bere thy children / and toke adamin∣srumentes to labour with & leste theym there. By this yeshall understond and take ensample to labour b∣seley. For and adam & eve had laboured besely / the fende had never overcome theym. For the fende desyreth no more whan he wold tempt a man but for to finde hym ydle And therfore know ye well that it is a rich salv against synne for to labour besdy. The thyrde is to chas∣tyse the body disretely. (Unde Paulus.

There for the lorde made to ca∣ste joseph in prison ther as pharao had put his boteler and his baker & as they fell a slepe they dremed the whiche dre∣mes they tolde Joseph & he seide that the kyng

Thanne happyd hit aftyrwarde that the Emperour fill sike and sente aftyr criste fore to hele hym for hit was tol∣de hym that criste helid all that euer wolde come to hym of all manere of sykenesse what somme e∣uer sykenesse hit had be But thanne had¦de pylate done hym to dethe or the messengere come Than whanne the Emperoure vnderstonde that he sen∣te for pylate and made hym come to hym. and
whanne pilate herd this he was sore a ferde and toke one Cristus cote▪ And so whanne he co∣me to rome to the Em∣perour All tho that we∣re in presente made pyla¦te good chere all the why¦le that he hadde on Cri∣stus cote Ad the em∣perour swore be fore that he shulde be dede. Than toke they of the cote and a none as the cote was of the Emperour was so wothe with pilate that he putte hym in to a pry¦son till he hadde take coū¦sell what dethe that he shulde dye on. Than as sone as pylate woste and vnderstonde that he shul¦de be dede he toke his ow¦ne knyfe and slewe hym¦selfe with alle. And whanne the Emperour herde there of and vnder¦stonde that he hadde slay¦ne hym selfe and thanne a none he made to teye a grete stone a bowte pyla∣tes necke and to caste hym in to a watyr that is callid Tybir thanne whan he was caste in the¦re the fendis made soche a noyse ther a boute that all the Cite of rome was sore a freyed of hem. Thanne whan the Em¦perour sawe this he ma∣de to take hym vp ayene and than was he caste in to a watyr that was be∣twixe to hye hilles and sollonge tyme astyr there was in the watyr many horrible sightes sayne a bowte that cursed man. Thus oure lord ihr¦su criste suffered passion and dethe for all mākyn¦de and furste whanne he was take they did buffete hym and stripyd hym naked and bete him with stourgis A vertice capitia vsʒ ad plan¦tis pedmn non fuit in eo sanitas that fro the highheste place of his he de to the sole of the fe¦te was no thyng lefte ho¦le one hym but all rawe & aftyr made a croune of thornys & set hit on his

Thus oure lord prechyd be fo∣re the vengeaunce that fill aftyr vpon iherusalem. The whiche prophe¦cye Jeremye the prophete spake of that is radde in hooly churche these thre dayes at tenebras the whi¦che was so horible of ma¦ny diuerse myscheuys & in speciall of hoūger that children lay for hounger dede in the stretis Than was there a woman was come of grete birthe that for hunger toke her own child that fedde with her pappys and slewe hit & partid hit in ij. partyes and than she rostyd hal¦fe and that othir halfe she kepte till on the mo∣rowe.

And so whan he shulde dye he be¦gan as Iohan Hellet seythe. Deus meus respice in me And so seyde all verses sewyng till he co¦me vn to that verse. In te domine speram.

Thanne for to shewe his grete goodnesse and com¦passion that oure lord ha the of mākynde A shall telle yow this ensample. we rede in the syffe of seinte Carpe how a man of mysse beleue turnyd a cristen man oute of hys feythe and for soke his beleue and his cristendo me where fore this holy man Carpe was so wro∣the that he fill in grete sy¦kenesse and whan he shul de haue preyde to god for a mendement he preyde nyghte and day that he myghte see hem haue a bodely vengeaunce Thā hit happid atte a myde∣nyghte as he preyde thus sodenly the house that he lay ynne cleuyd in foure partis And he loked vp aud sawe one honged so piteusly that hit was gre¦te pite to se and than he lokyd vp to heuen and there he sawe oure lord ihesu Criste with a grete multitude of angeles sit∣tyng in his trone. and he lokyd vp ayen and than he sawe this ij. men stondyng be fore an hot te ouyn quakyng and tremelyng for drede of fend is like adderis and wormes comyng oute of the ouyn to draw the se ij. men in to the ouyn with hem.

But many had leuer to here a songe of robynhode or tale of re¦baudry where for goddis worde shall not be p̄chith to soche. And somme he yeuithe grace so in vn¦derstondyng of diuerse langage As Englische Frenche walche Irische with oute any grete tra∣uayle in lernyng hit ys a grete yifte and a mira¦cle and a speciall grace of almyghty god that any man can vnderstonde ou¦re in spekyng There be v. letteres that makythe all the wordes of all the worlde and of all langa∣ges that be vnder heuene.

Somme he yeuithe also to dde god in so moche that they be euer a fede to displese al¦myghty god and euer

Her sunt septem do na spiri∣tua sancti. These be the yeftes that, the holy goste departid among all mākynde and yeuithe somme more than sum∣me But there may no man excuse hym but that the holy goste assignithe hym somwhat of these in tyme of his cristonyng where the bishopp̄ at the confermacion rehersithe these wordes of the sa∣cramēt I woll tell you an ensample to fere yow the more to the sacramēt of cristonyng that is foū¦den in the lysse of seynte James There was an holy bi¦shoppe that tourned low is the kyng of Fraunce to cristen feythe and so whan the kyng come to cristen at the halowyng of the founte there was grete prese of peple that the clerke that bare the bi¦shoppes crismatory my¦ghte not bryng hit to the bishoppe. and so whan the fonte was halowed & come to the Anoyn∣tyng he myghte not co∣me to his crismatory. thā the bishoppe lifte vp his eyen to god preyng god deuontly for helpe and a none there with there co∣me a done as white as a∣ny milke that was the ho¦ly gost beryng in her bill a violl with oyle and cre¦me to the bishoppe And whan he openyd the vy¦oll there come oute there of so swete a sauour that all the people had wōdre

Here by ye may well se though the preste sey the wordis the holy goste worchith the sacrament and dothe vertu of the wordes. Now that the holy go∣ste may descende and ly∣ghten in vs that we may come to receyue hym to oure saluacione Amen. In die pentheco∣sten GOod men and wymmen thys day is callid wyt sonday for be cause that this day the hooly goste broughte wytte and wy∣sedome in to cristus disci¦ples. and so by her pre∣chyng aftyr in to all cri¦stendome Than may ye vnderstonde that many hathe wytte but not wy∣sedome for there be ma∣ny that haue wytte to p̄∣che well and to sey well but there be fewe that ha¦the wysedome to do well There be many wyse p̄∣chorys and techourys. but her leuyng is no ma¦ner thyng aftyr her pre¦chyng. Also ther be ma¦ny that labourith to ha∣ue wytte and connyng but fewe trauelith to co∣me to good leuyng for who so haue wytte and connyng to gete good with fayre sotyll wordis be they neuer so false he is wyse but wytte of ho∣lynesse is not sette by For he that can gete good fal¦sely with knackys and mowus he is a wyse mā but he that for sakyth the wytte of this worlde is
sole But loke what holy scripture seythe Domi∣nus recitauit nom̄ paperis quia ipsū approbauit et nomē eins in libro scrip∣tum fuit Oure lord ha¦the receyued the name of the pore man for he hath preuyd hym in his po∣uerte and wretyn his na¦me in the boke of lyffe Sed nomen diuitia tacuit quia ipsū nō approbauit. But he lefte the riche man for he hathe not preuyd hym but thoug a man be ne¦uer so riche atte the laste he shall be pore For nou¦ghte he bryngythe with hym but his good dedis and his badde he that le¦uythe well and techithe well for a good ensam∣ple in leuyng is a good doctryne. This grace as this day was yeuen to cristus disciples for they taughte well and leuyd well for they gaue good informacion  techyng of good ensample in le¦uyng sore her techyng and her leuyng is sprad de a bowte in all the worl¦de. Than how the come to this grace ye shall here Post ascensioneml domini. Aftyr whan that oure lord ihesu cri¦ste was steyed vp in to heuen his disciples were in grete heuynesse & mor¦nyng for they had de lo∣ste her maystre that they louyd full well and for hym had de loste all ther goodys for his loue and for sake all her frenchipp̄ and sewed hym full po¦re in hope that they shul¦de gretely be holpen by hym. And thus they we¦re alle heuy and gretely stonyed and sore a fer∣de to be takyn of the ieo es and caste in pryson & aftyr to be putte to deth This made hem sory that they durste not go a monge the people sore to gete hem mete & dryn¦ke▪ but yit as criste badde hem in his ascension they wente in to the Cite of
Iherusaleth and there they were in an halle of stage and there they sat∣te to gedyr preyng vn to god with hole herte and one sperite of helpe and socoure and somme com¦forte in her dissese Than as they were thus preing to gedyr sodenly there was a grete clowde made in the eyre like a blaste of thoundre and euyn ther with the hooly goste co∣me among hem Et ap¦parnerunt illis di∣spertite liugne tan quam ignis. And ly¦ghte come downe amon∣ge hem in likenesse of tō¦ges brennyng and not smertyng warmyng and not hermyng lygh¦tenyng and not flate∣ryng Et repletisūt omnes spiritu san∣cto And fillid hem full of gostly witte for as they where to sore but lewde men of sighte and vn let tered and verray Ide∣ottes as of coyng and nothyng cowde of cler¦gye sodenly they were the wyseste men and the be¦ste clerkes in the worlde And anone they spake all maner langages vndir the sonne and there as be¦fore her hertis was colde for drede and for fere of dethe Thanne were they so comfortid with the ho¦ly goste in brennyng lo¦ue that they wente and prechyd and taught the worde of god sparyng for no drede but redy to ta¦ke the dethe for cristus sa¦ke Thanne at that tyme there were in Iherusalē people of all nacions and drewe in to the temple for grete fere of the blaste of thoundre that was in the eyre and stodyed what hit myghte be. Thanne come the poste¦les in to the temple and prechyd and all maner nacions vndirstode hem and they vndirstode all maner nacions & so they p̄chyd the worde of god Thanne were the peple a stoyned whā they herde
the posteles speke all ma¦ner of langages. Than seyde somme these haue dronke so moche muste that they wotte not what they do seye nothir what they mene for they be all dronkyn Than answer∣de petir and seyde we be not dronke but this was the prophecie of Iohell the prophete how the ho¦ly goste shulde be yeuen plenteuous to the peple so that they shulde speke with all tonges that is to p̄che and all in the worl¦des the lawe of criste. Thanne the people tue¦ned faste and so with in sewe yeris the seythe was in all the worlde. Now hit is to wete why the ho¦ly goste more apperyd in to lykenesse of tonges rathir than in any othir party of mannes body & why he come to hem sit∣tyng rathir than stan∣dyng. As to the fursce this is the cause. a tonge is the beste membre of a mannes body whan hyt is in▪ good rewle and well disposed but whan hyt is oute of rewle hit is the worsce. Denenum a∣spidum sub labiis eorum Bitter venemé is vnder the tonges that speakithe euyll seythe Da¦uid in the sawter. And as seint Ieme seythe A¦cursed tonge is fired with fyre of hell and may not be chastifid while the fy¦re brennyth hit And al∣so for tonges muste speke wordis of fyre that ys sharpe and sperkelyng to sey trouthe and notte spare in prechyng and techyng to repreue mys dedis for as holy men in olde tyme ouercome and droue a wey the fyre of ly¦ghtenyng with holy wor¦des and good preyou∣res with the brennyng lo¦ue to god ryghte for the fyre of the holy gost shul¦de dryue a weye and o∣uercome the fyre of helle that enuy hath and euyll leuyng that regnyth now in the tonges of moche
people and in her herte And for the apostlis & othir prechoris that co∣mythe aftyr hem shulde speke brennyng wordis that is neythir to sharpe nothir for drede nor for loue to sey the trouthe & to tell the people her de∣fautes and to repreue the synne that regneth in hē in many diuerse wyse and so to do and sey the wor¦de of god and to repre¦ue synne. and but they woll leue synne they shall with oute remedy be dā∣ned in to the fyre of hell for thoughe thou shuldi∣ste dye spare not to pre∣che the worde of god and telle the trouthe Item deus ē misericors penitentibus pecca tasua. Also god is mercyfull to theym that be sory for her synnes & woll leue hem Tm ue¦ro confessus fuerit et relinuerit ea mi¦sericordia cōse qua tur For thoughe a mā haue do neuer so moche synne and he woll shrey¦ue hym and for sake his synne mercy shall folowe hym and he shall haue for yeuenesse and so come to the bryghte fyre euer la∣styng blysse that is the precious loue of god that brennythe amonge ange¦lis and seyntis in heuen Also he comythe in lyke¦nesse of tonges of fyre for it is the kynde of fyre to make lowe that is highe and to warme that is col¦de to make softe that is harde and make harde that is softe And also the hooly goste makythe hertis that be high of pri¦de and enuy he makythe hem lowe and warme in loue and charite and also harde hertis that ha¦ue be gaderyng and hol¦dyng of worldely goo∣des the hooly goste ma∣kythe hem softe and li∣berall to yeue and to de le almesse dede for the lo∣ue of almyghty god and makythe theym harde al¦so▪ in sufferyng of harde
and streyte leuyng and in doyng of grete penaū¦ce for her synnes. Thus the hooly goste is euer re¦dy to make salue or to hele all maner of synnes That othir skylle ys why the hooly goste co∣me to the apostles ra∣thir sittyng thanne ston¦dyng for sittyng be to kenythe mekenesse in her¦te with reste pece and v∣nyte the whiche any m∣ner a man muste nedis haue that woll sceyue the hooly goste for right s the drye wode wolle brenne clerely with onte steryng so shulde euery cristen man loue othyr with brennyng loue and charite clerely with oute feynyng of wrathe or en¦uy or any maner of ma∣lice eche with othir and euery man shulde be fy¦ne of other is welfare and this maythe to haue a good tonge. But as sone as the brondes be ca¦ste a twynne by descnsi∣n of malice and enuye a none the fyre of the ho¦ly goste quenchith and thanne risithe vp smoke of grete wrathe and en∣uye betwene party and party and also grete gre¦uaunce and heuynesse for the soule and causithe it to fayle grace that it may haue no consideracion to reson than anon the wic¦kyd spirites bene redy ryse & vp smoke in the sa¦me mannes herte that is for to say grete wrathe and enuy and euyll will that hit may haue no ma¦ner reste but euer stody∣yng and thynkyng al¦so howe he may auenge hym and doo vengeaun¦re vn to his enemyes and so is a man euer troblid and besy in cursid ded is and like to be dampned body and soule in hell to euerlastyg pyne but yf he haue socoure and helpe of the hooly gose and alle soche thynges that may come of cur∣sid and wicked ton∣ges.
There for the hooly go¦ste comythe in the lyke∣nesse of tonges of fyre to brenne oute the malyce & enuye and anoynte hem with swetenesse of grace loue and charite. And therefor we shall prey to the hooly goste to yeue vs grace so to tempre ou¦re tonges that we may e¦uer more speke good & that oure hertys may be fedde with mekenesse that we may be abyll to be fed¦de with the hooly goste. As seynt Gregor was whanne he expouned the prophecie he toke to him his dekon seint Petyr to wryte as he expouned. and made drawe betwe¦ne hym for petyr schulde not se how he dyde in his stodyyngg. Thanne as Gregor satte in his chair stodyyng holdyng vp his hond and his eyen to he uenward the holy goste come lyke a whyte downe with fote and bill brennyng golde and sat¦te on Gregor right shu∣dre and putte her bill in Gregoris mouthe. and whanne he with drewe it than he bad Petyr wry¦te and so continued till he hadde made an ende. but he expowned the go¦spell so boldely that Pe∣tyr hadde meruayle ther of and preuely made an hole in the clothe y• was betwene gregor and hym and sawe how the holy goste fedde hym. And a none the holy goste shew de Grgor howe Petyr hadde done Than Ere∣gor blamyd Petyr and chargid him that he shul¦de neuer sey no thyng whyle he leued. But whanne gregor was dede an eretike wolde haue brē¦ned his bokys that this holy mā made & than Pe¦tyr with stode hym and seyde nay and tolde all how the holy goste had∣de done to hym whyle he expowned the prophe∣cie and so sauyd his bo¦kys vnbrennyd that he hadde made by the grace
of god and yifte of the holy goste the whiche ye¦ue vs grace to be fedde of hym here in oure leuyng that we may haue the blys¦se that neuer shal haue en¦de Amen. In die sncte tri¦nitatis GOod men and wymmen thys day ys an highe and a solempne feste in holy churche for it is of the hooly Trinite For as holy churche at wyt∣sontyde makith mencion how the hooly goste co∣me vn to cristus disciples Now at this tyme is ma¦de mencion of all iij. per¦snes that is for to say. Pater filiue et spi¦ritus Fadyr and sone and holy goste thre per¦sones and one god in tri¦nite where for we be boun¦de to d all the reueren∣ce and worshippe that we can or may to this ho¦ly trinite Also ye shall vnderstonde whye howe and what the cause that this fste was ordeyned This hooly feste was
worshippid for the trini¦te fedyng for heretikes confoundyng and fore the trinite worshippyng Furste hitwas ordeyned for the forme of the tri∣nite fyndyng And a gre¦te clerke Iohan Bellet tellith that forme trinite was in the furste mā adā onre forme fadyr that co¦me of the erthe one per¦sone and Eue of Adam the seconnde persone of hem bothe come the iij. persones as her childe. Thus the trinite was founde in man where fore man shulde haue mynde to doo worshippe to the hooly trinite. For hooly churche ordeyned that in weddyng of man and woman to gedyr so that the masse of the trynyte is songon. and atte hys dethe one belle shalle be ronge in worshipp̄ of the Trinite where for all cri¦sten peple be bounde gre¦tely to worshippe the ho¦ly Trinite. The se∣counde cause is that feste is ordeyned in confoun∣dyng of heretikes and of lolleris for to distroye theym and theyr false opynyones that they had¦de a yenste the hooly tri∣nite fore ryghte as he reti∣kes in the be gynnyg of the feythe with her swe∣te wordes and false opy∣nynes where a boute to distroye the feythe of the hooly Trinite in the sa∣me wyse lolleris nowe a dayes with her false spe∣ce of gyle be a boute also to with drawe the peo∣ple from the trewe bele∣ue and feythe of the ho∣ly trinite and the beleue and feythe of hooly chir¦che  marteres and confessoures to the dethe Ryghte so now this lol∣leris pursewithe men of hooly churche and be a boute in all maner weyes that they can and may fynde to distroye and vn¦do hem so that they my∣ghte haue her purpose.

Also we rede whyle he lay in his cra∣dyll he fastyd wenys∣day & freyday these day∣es he wold soke but ones of the day and therwith helde hym plesid Thus he leuyd all his lyue in vertuous with this child is name And ther fore children done hym wor∣shippe be fore alle othyr feintys for he was euer meke with oute any mali¦ce so that all people prey∣sed hym for his meke le¦uyng here. Also he was bishoppe of the cite of mirre by the whiche that come from heuyn. For whan the bishoppe was dede all the bishoppes of the countre come to ge∣dyr to chese anothir than ne come a voyce to on of hem and bad hym ryse erly in the morowe and go to the churche dore & make hym bishop that ye finde there that is callid Nicolas And so on the morowe he come to the churche dore and ther he founde Nicolas And than he seyd thus to hym Quale nomē habea¦tu what is thy name.

Sone come with me for I haue to specke with the in counsell and so ladde hym to the othir bishoppes and seyd lo seris here is he that god hathe ordeyned to be. And so they made hym bishop of mirre by heuen¦ly chesyng. He hadde al¦so a grete compassione of tho that where in dissese
and parell for whan his fadyr and his modir dy¦ed they lefte hym wor∣dely good y now the whi¦che that he spente on thē that where pore & nedy. Hyt fell so that ther was a riche man that had iij. fayre doughters yong wymmen but by mishe∣fe he fell in to pourte so that for grete nede he or∣deyned his eldyste dou∣ghter for to be a comyn woman. And so after the tothir to doughters for he myghte not fynde hem And so by this me¦ne gote his leuyng and heris bothe for he woste not how to leue for the grete pouerte that he sto¦de ynne And whan Ni¦colas herde there of he hadde grete compassione of hem all and come pre¦uely in a nyghte to this mannes house & at a wyn¦dow he caste a bgge of gold in to this mannes chanbre. and on the mo∣row whan this man ose and founde this golde a none ther with he mari∣ed his eldeste doughter Thanne come nicolas & brought anothir sone af∣ter and ther with he ma¦ried the secounde dou∣ghter Thanne this man had grete meruayle how this gold come the thir and wakyd preuely to knowe ther of a the thridde tyme Nicolas come and this man her¦de the golde fall anone he wente oute and ouerto∣ke Nicolas and whan he know that hit was he that had holpen hym so in his nede he knelid dow¦ne and wolde haue kyssid his fete but he wolde not suffre hit but prayed hym to kepe counsell while he leuyd. Also anothir tyme men where in the see lyke to be drowned in a grete tem¦pest they cryed to god & seint nicolas seyng thus Domine rex eterne succurre nobis mi∣serie.
Lord kyng euer lastyng socour vs wrech∣is & anone nicolas come and seyd. Docasti me ecce assum pre∣sena o I am present at your callyng and so brought hem forthe saue and sounde to londe. Also ther was in the count in a tyme grete derthe of corn Fame valida and grete houn¦ger in so moche that the people where all moste loste for the faute of me∣te Thanne hit hapenyd ther come shippes of the Emperours frayghte in to an hauyn with whete in that countre. Thanne wente seint Nicolas to hem & preyde hem that he myght haue of euery ship¦pe a .C. bushelles of her whete for to releue the pe¦ple with And he wolde vndyr take that they shul¦de lake none of her mette whan they come home thanne he hadde all his as¦kyng and whan the ship∣pes come to the empe∣rour they hadde her full mesure and lackyd no thyng of her corne that seint nicolas hadde tho∣rough his hooly preyour Oquam probat san¦ctum dei farris au∣gmentacio. O how meruelously be grace of god and preyour of this hooly man this whete was multiplied and en¦cresyd for of that whete was so grete plente that hit founde all the people to ete and drincke and sowgh y now thre yere af¦ter. Anothir miracle ther where .ij. knyghtes that where accused of treson to the emperour of a fal∣se mater and where com¦maunded to preson for to haue ben putte to deth sone after Thanne they cryde to god and to seint nicolas for helpe and so∣cour so that the nyght be¦fore that they shulde be dede seint nicolas come
to the Emperour as he lay in his bedde and seyd thus to hym why haste so wrongfully dampned these knyghtes to dethe a ryse vp anone and dely uer hem ote of preson anone or else y woll prey to god to reyse batell vp on the in the whiche thou shalt dye and wylde be∣stys shall ete the. Than seyd the Emperour to hym what arte thou that so boldely spekyth and so thretenyste me Thanne seyd he y am nicolas the bishop of mirre than the Empero sente after the knygs and yde to hem what wyche crafte can ye that thus hathe traueled me to nyght know ye any man that hyghte Nicolas bi∣shope of mirre Thanne as sone as they herde this name they fell downe to the grounde and helde vp her handys thankyng god and seint Nicolas. whanne they hadde tolde the Emperour of his lyffe and how hooly he was the Emperour ba hem go to hym and than ke hem of her lyffe and so they dede and he prey de the knyghtes to prey Nicolas to thretyn the Emperour no more but prey to god for hym and for his reame and so they dede. Thus ye may see that he hathe grete com∣passion of hym that whe re in dissese. Thanne af∣ter whan seint Nicolas shulde dye he preyde to god to sende hym an An gell to fette his soule. And whan he sawe this angell come seint Nico∣las lowted and seyd. In manua tu do∣mint commendo spi ritum meum rede∣misti me domine dt no veritatis. And so he yelde vp the goste. and whan he was bery∣d at the he de of his tom be sprange a well of oyle that dede medicyns to all sores Thanne hit hap pyd many yeris after
that turkys distroyed the cite of mirre ther as sein te nicolas lay and whan the people of the cite of Barus herde that the ei∣te of mirre was distroy∣ed. xlvij. knyghtes whe∣re ordeynd to go the dyr than they arayde shippis and wente the thyr and be tellyng of four mon∣kes that where lefte ther they knewe seint nicolas tombe and vndede hit a none and there they foun¦de seint Nicolas bones swymmyng in oyle than they toke hem vp and broughte hem to the cite of Barus with grete so∣lempnite. Thanne for grete miracles that wher roughte there in the ci∣te of mirre encrefid yene And so after seint nico∣las was dede they chose anothir bishoppe in his stede and anone after by enmyte of the people he was putte downe from his bishopriche and than anone the oyle sesyd and ranne no more. Thanne was the bishoppe callyd ayene to hi than the oyle sprangoute ayene as hit dede to fore and de¦de many miracles. Ther was a criston man borowed a certeyn some of money of a iewe and the Iewe seyd he wolde lene none but he hadde a borow. and this cristen man seyd he had none but seint nicolas & he graunted to take seint nicolas to borow Than this cristen man sore vp on the auter that he wolde well and trewly pay this money ayeny & so departyd and wente her wey tyll day of pay∣ment come and whanne this day was passyd than the iwe askyd his mo∣ney and this cristen man seyde that he hadde payde hym & the iewe seyde nay he hadde not. and that othir seyde he hadde and that he wold do his lawe and swere vp on a boke And so whanne the day
come that they shuld go to the lawe the cristen man made hym an holo∣we staffe and putte the gold ther in and so co∣me to the lawe. And whanne he shulde swere whyle he wente to the bo lie he toke the Iewe his staffe ther the gold was ynne to holde. And by this mene swore he had payde the iewe and whan he hadde sworne he toke his staffe of the iewe a yene and wente home∣wardes And as he wen te by the wey he was pas syng slepy and he leyde hym downe to slepe in the hyghe weye Thanne hit happenyd there co∣me a carte rennyng and wente ouer this man and slewe hym and brake his staffe that the golde was ynne and the golde fylle oute. Thanne the peo∣ple sawe that this come of grete vengeaūce for the falshede that he had done And they fette the iewe and bad hym take vp his money. Thanne was the iewe sory and seyd he wolde not but yf that they wolde prey seinte ni¦colas to rere hym ayene than he wolde be cristen. eleuauit a defun∣cti defunctum. Thanne this dede man was reryd from deth to lyffe by the preyour of seint nicolas Baptisa∣tor auri viso inde∣us indicio Thanne this iwe that was oute of the beleue by the fight of this miracle he was cristened. Also there was ano∣thyr iewe that sawe the grete myght of seint Ni¦colas in miracles wor∣thyng and he lette ma¦ke an ymage of seint Ni¦colas and sette it in his shippe to kepe his good and chargyd the yma∣ge to kepe well his good whyle he was absent and whanne this man was gone ther come theuys of the see and robbed
this man and bare a wey his good And whanne this Iewe come home ayene and sawe all his good gone he was full wrothe with seint Nico¦las and toke a staffe and all to bete this ymage & seyde. Ecce omnia bo na mea posui in ve∣ltra custodia Ioqd he I toke all my good to your kepyng for gre∣te truste and hit is stole a wey ye haue disseued me and there for thou shalte a bye euery day tyll y ha∣ue my good ayene. Thā as these theues departyd the good seint Nicolas come to hem and seyd Cur tam directe fe cistia me flagella∣ri why haue ye made me be betyn thus sore Than they seyd Quia eatn what arte thou that spe∣yste thus to vs Than he seyd Ego sum Ni¦colaua seruua dei. I am Nicolas the ser∣uaunt of god that ye ha¦ue made thus sore be be∣tyn and shewde hem how sore he was betyn for the good that they had bor ne a wey that was taken hym to kepe and he bad de hem goo and bere this good ayene a none or el∣lys goddys vengeaunce shall falle one yow and ye shall be hongyd in hell euerichone. Than they were sore a ferde and ba∣re ayene the good that same nyghte And one the morow whanne the Iewe come and sawe his good broughte aye∣ne anone he was criste∣nyd and after that he was an hooly man And euery yere after on seinte Nicolas day for the gre∣te loue that he hadde to seint Niclas and alse of a sone that he had de that was a clerke he made a grete feste on seint Nico¦las day thanne hit hap∣ped on a tyme vp one a seynte Nicolas day he badde many clercys to his feste Thanne come the fynde to the gate in ly
kenesse of a pilgreme and a shyd somme good for goddys sake. Thanne the good man that ma∣de the feste toke his sone elmesse to bere the pelgre me so the childe wente to the gate thanne was the pelgreme gone And the childe folowed after the fende. And whanne he was a good wey from his fadyris place the fen∣de caughte the childe and slewe hit And whanne the fadyr herde there of he was full sory and to∣ke the childe and leyde hit in his chambre and tryde for sorowe and seyd a seint Nicolas is this the rewarde and mede that I shall haue for the grete worshippe that I do to the and anone the childe rose from dethe to lyffe than this man was full gladde and thankyd god and seynte Nico∣las. Anothir miracle ther was a man that preyde to god and to seint Ni¦colas that he myghte ha∣ue a childe and yf he had a childe he wolde lede hit to the churche of seynte Nicolas and there he wolde offer vp a couppe of golde and than sone after he hadde a childe. And whanne this chil∣de was of resonable age his fadyr dede do make a couppe of golde And whanne hit was made hit likyd hym so well that he lete make anothir and thanne he wente towar∣des seint Nicolas chur∣che and he muste passe ouer the see. So whanne they were in the see the fadyr badde the sone take vp some water with the couppe. And than the childe wolde haue caught water and the couppe fyll oute of his honde in to the see And than the childe wolde haue caught the couppe ayene and fill after in to the see and so the childe was drow∣ned there in the see.
Thanne the fadyr made moche sorowe but yit he wente forth with y• othir couppe to do his pilgre∣mage And whanne he come to seint Nicolas churche and offerid vp his couppe and sette it on the Auter anone hit was caste from the auter and he sette hit ayene & hit was caste ferther and yit the thride tyme he set te hit ayene and thanne hit was caste moche fer¦ther Thanne come the childe with y• othir coup∣pe in his honde and seyd to all the peple that seint nicolas toke hym vp by the hande whanne he fill in to the see and latte him saue oute. Thanne was the fadyr gladde and of fered vp there bothe cou¦pes and wente home a yene with grete ioye and myrthe. There was anothyr ryche man that be prey∣ores of seint Nicolas hadde a childe and he ma¦de a feyre chappell in wor¦shippe of god and seint Nicolas. So hit hap∣ped on a day this childe was takyn wih enemys and ladde in to anothir straynge countre & there he was in seruice in the kynges courte And as it happed on a seint Ni¦colas day he be thoughte hym of the grete myrthe and solempnite that was made that day in his fa∣dres chapel at home and he was heuy and sikyd wounder sore. Thanne the hyng herde ther of Thanne seyd the kyng Nicolas what meneste thou to sighte so sore be mery for thou muste ne∣dys a byde here with vs And anone ther come a grete wynde and smo∣te the house and braste hit And the childe was caughte vp with the cup¦pe that he bare in his han¦de and was sette be fore the gate of the Chapell ther as his fadyr made his feste. Thanne was
there made grete ioye and myrthe of this miracle. To thus ye may see how grete compassione that seint Nicolas hadde of hem that where in mishe¦ue and dissese somme bo¦kys say y• this childe was of Normandy and was takyn with a sowdon be yonde the see and ofte he was betyn. And ones whan he was betyn vp on a seint Nicolas day and putte in to preson than he wepte sore And with that he fell on slepe And whanne he woke he was in the chirche of his fadres.

she was so gentyll to him for they where bothe go∣od and hooly yit god sente hem no frute of her bodyes but where barey∣ne. where fore they made a vowe to god that yf he wold sende hem a chil¦de they wolde offered vn to hym vp to the tem∣ple for to serue god bo∣the nyghte and day. Thanne on a day as Ioachym wente with his neyborus to the tem∣ple to do his offerynges The bishoppe that hi∣ghte Isachar whukyd hym openly before all the people and seyd Ioa∣chym hit fallyth not for the that arte bareyne and haste no frute to do offe rynges with othir peple that god hathe sente fru¦te in Jherusalem Than was Ioachym sore dys∣mayed and distonyed with this rebuke Than he wente home wepyng and toke his schepard preuely with his schepe and wente forthe into a ferre countrey a mongt mounteynes and hyllis and purposid to haue be there all his lyffe and neuer more to come ho∣me to Anne hys wyffe Thanne whan ioachym was gone Anne was so¦ry and preyde to god and seyd lord that me is woo that I am ba∣reyne and may haue no frute and now more my husbonde is gone from me I wote not whethir he is be come lorde haue mercy on me. Thanne as she preyde thus an an∣gell come downe and cō∣forted her and seyde an∣ne be of good comforte for thou shalt haue a chil¦de in thyne olde age ther was neuer none lyke ne neuer shall be. Thanne was anne a ferde of this Angellys his word is & of the ighte of hym and lay all wey in her preyou¦res as she hadde be dede. Thanne wente the same Angell to Ioachym & seyde these same wordes
and badde Ioachym ta¦ke a lambe and offyr hit in sacrifice to god and so he dede and whanne he hadde done so from myd¦day tyll euensonge tyme he lay on the grounde in his preyoures thankyng god with all his herte. Thanne on the morow as the angell bad he wen¦te homewarde to Anne his wyffe with his shepe And whanne he come nyghe home the Angell come to Anne and bad her goo to the gate that was callyd the goldyn gate and a byde her hus∣bonde there tyll he come. Thanne was she gladde and toke her meydenes with her and wente to the gate and there sche¦mette with ioachym and seyd lorde I thanke the for I was a wedowe and now am a wyffe I was bareyne and now y shall haue a childe y was woo and wepynge and now y shall be in ioye lykyng And sone after anne con¦seyued oure lady And whan she was borne she was callyd mary as the angell badde be fore. Than after that she was wenyd she was brought to the temple and lefte there among othir vir∣genys to serue god both nyghte and day. Than was she so meke among all othir virgenys in all her leuyng that all vir∣genys cally her quene of virgenys So she is the mekyste of all the seintes that be  heuen and most redye to helpe all them that callith to her in any nede. we rede in hooly write a miracle of oure lady. There was a lordys man that hadde gaderyd moche good of his lor∣dys for he was his rente gaderar and wente to be re hit to his lorde Than was ther theses that set∣te for hym to robbe hym by the weye in the woode there as he muste nedys
goo thourghe So whan he come in to the wode he be thoughte hym that he hadde not seyde oure la¦dy sauter as he was won¦te to do And he knelyd downe and beganne to sey. Thanne come oure lady lyke a fayre madyne and sette a garlounde on his hede and at eche aue she sette a rose in the gar∣lounde that was so bry∣ghte that all the woode shone there of and whan he hadde done he kyssed the erthe and wente his wey. Thanne come the theses and toke hym and ledde hym to her maistre the whiche had seyen all these doynges than seyde he to hym what woman was that that sette the garlaunde on thyne hede and he seyd irre for so the y sye no woman ne gar∣launde Than seyd these maister these y wote well thou arte a lordys man & haste moche good with the but y wolde fayne we¦te what woman that hit was that come to the and why thou knelyst downe and he seyd whan y sigh yow y was a ferde and al¦so y be thought me that y hadde not seyd oure la¦dy sauter and knelyd dou¦ne to sey it preyng oure la¦dy to helpe me at my ne∣de than seyd he for her lo¦ue goo thy wey and prey to her for vs and so he wente his wey safe and sounde be helpe and so∣cour of oure dere lady. But now ye shall here how this feste was firste founde. There was a kyng in Englond that highte wyllyam conque∣rour he sente the abbot of ramsey to the kyng of denemarke on his messa¦ge and whan he come in to the see there come a derkenes and a tempest that he and all that whe¦re with hym wente to ha¦ue be drowned. And euery man preyde besyly to god and to oure la∣dy for socour and helpe and othir dyuerse seyn∣ts
and this abbot prey¦de to god and to oure lady full deuotely Than come to hem a fayre wo¦man and seyd to them yf ye woll haue the con∣tepcione of oure lady in worshippe that is .ij. day¦es after seint nicolas day she woll be redy to helpe and socour yow at this tyme and than this ab∣bot seyd ye with good wyll and y woste what shulde be the seruice of the feste. Thanne seyd she the same that is in the Natiuite safe tourne the natiuite in to the con¦cepcion And the abbot seyde hit shulde be done with full good wyll. than anone the tempest ssed and all was well and they saylid forthe & the Abbot dede his message and come ayene safe and sounde & spedde well in e∣uery degre. And whan he come home he tolde the kyng this vision the kyng made hym preche it in all the reame aboute And thus hit was a lowed in all hooly chur¦che. Also we finde that ther was a seculer cha∣non that one a tyme wen¦te ouer a water to haue done a vowtrey with a woman And as he was a boute to be gynne to sey oure lady matenes & as he was at the inuita∣tory that is Aue maria there with the fende caste him downe and drowned hym & wolde haue hadde hym to hell. thanne come oure lady & seyd why ha¦ste thou take this man the fende seyd for we fynde hym in oure seruice go∣yng to do a vowtrey. thā seyd oure lady he was in my seruice & anone re∣storid hym to lyffe ayen & bad hym do no more synne And bad hym to halowe also her concep∣cion so he dede and was a good man euer after all his lyffe.
Also there was a cler∣ke that euery day vsed to sey the seruice of oure la∣dy thanne hit happid be councell of his frendis he shulde haue a wyffe and whanne he shulde be wed¦ded he be thoughte hym that he hadde not seyd oure lady seruice. Than he made all the people to goo oute of the chirche whyle he seyd his serui∣ce And thanne he kne∣lyd a downe and seyd his seruice tyll he come to an antem of oure lady Quam pulchra es amica mea. Thanne oure lady aperyd vn to hym and seyd why say¦ste thou that I am fayre and honeste why wytte thou than leue me and ta¦ke anothir Thanne seyd he on to oure lady what wolte thou that I shall do thanne seyd oure la∣dy yf thou wolte leue thy fleschely wyffe and serue my sone and me I shall be thy spouse and thou shalte haue with me a cro¦wne of euer lastyng lyffe in the kyngdome of euer astyng blysse the whiche god and his blessed mo¦dyr seynt mary and all hooly seintys in heuene bryng vs all thethir now and euer Amen.

GOod men and wymmen soche a day ye shall haue seynt thomas day that was cristys apostell and ye shall faste the euyne & do hym worshippe speci¦ally for thre causes The firste for the preuyng of oure beleue And for gre¦te wounderes in his wey And grete miracles in his day. This hooly a∣postell preued so oure feythe that he lefte no tro¦ble for whanne the disci∣ples seyd that oure lord was resyn from dethe to lyue and they had seyne hym and spoke with him Thomas seyd he wol∣de not beleue it till he had putte his honde in to his syde in to the woūde that
the spere hadde made. Thanne .viij. dayes af∣ter whan all the disciples were to gedyr and Tho¦mas wih hem Thanne oure lord ihesu criste co∣me bodely to hem and seyde Par vobis Pees be with yow and thanne oure lode seyd to Tho¦mas of ynde. Mitte manum tuam in la∣tus meum Putte thy honde in to my syde in to the wounde that was made with the spere that smote me to the herte. Et noli esse incre∣dulus. And be no len∣ger oute of the beleue but be stede faste in the fey¦the Thanne whan tho∣mas hadde do so a none he cryed and seyde for grete woundre. Domi∣nua meus et deus meus. my lord my god I beleue that thou arte verry god and man. Thanne oure lorde seyd to hym Beatiqui cre¦diderunt et non vi∣derunt. blessed be tho that beleue and se not. for now thow haste seyn thou beleuiste but yit the taryng of Thomas broughte vs to sadder be¦leue and to the blessyng of oure lord ihesu criste Of thys spekyth seynte Gregori and seyth tho∣mas of ynde thou haste holpe more to the feythe that woldeste not beleue tyll thou haddiste felyd his wounde thanne dyd mary mawdeleyne that dyd beleue at firste sighte Mnus est enim in maria magdalene que cicius credidit quam Thomas qui diu dubitauit Thus Thonas preued oure feythe and oure beleue that we nedyd neuer to vary nor be in dowte. Also thomas dyd many meruallys & grete woun¦derys that were in his da¦yes. Hit happid that a kyng of ynde sende his messen¦ger Abbanus. In die
requirens artifici¦um to seke somme craf∣ty man in to the countre of cesar to seke a carpen∣ter that coude make hym a palyse to his plesaunce Thanne oure lord ihesu criste mete with this ab∣banus and sente hym to Thomas in to ynde also whan thomas and Ab∣banus were passed the see they come in to a cite there as the kynges dou¦ghter was weddid the sa¦me day where fore all ma¦ner of people were com∣maundid to mete so a∣mong othir people tho∣mas and abbanus come ynne and where sette to mete but thomas ete not for his thoghte was euer of god and had no lu∣ste to ete Thanne come a botelere to thomas and smote thomas on the che¦ke and bad him ete than seyd Thomas to hym Non hunt surgam donec manus qui me percussit a anibus affertur. I shall not ryse from this place tyll that honde that smote me be broughte in with a do¦gge Thanne anone after the Boteler wente after water and a lyon mette with hym and flew hym and drancke his blode & ete of his body and than come a blake dogge and caughde that honde that smote thomas and brou¦ghte hit in to the halle in the sighte of all the peo∣ple and leyde hit downe before thomas than was there a woman that vn∣derstode thomas wordis and anone knelyd dow¦ne to thomas and cryde and seyd thou arte god or else on of his disciples for right as thou wolte so hit is thanne the kyng preyde to thomas to ble¦sse his doughter and her husbonde. than thomas was gladde ther of. Ce∣pit ergo predicare beatus thomas. ther¦fore the blessed thomas be ganne to preche & tol∣de hem of oure ihesu criste
that he tourned the man that was weddyd the sa¦me day from his wyffe and made hym bishop∣pe of the same cite and his wyffe a nonne and they were marterys after for cristys sake Thanne wente thomas forthe in to ynde to the kyng to ma¦ke hym a paleyse to his plesaunce so whanne tho∣mas was come to the kyng he was glad and delyueryd Thomas a grete somme of golde to make a paleyse with. than rode the kyng forth in the mene tyme And so whan thomas shulde haue ma¦de this paleyse hym thou¦ghte hit was better to ma¦ke a paleyse in heuen than in erh and delyd his gold a mong pore people and cōuertyd hem to the feyth Thanne come the kyng home and wente that his paleyse hadde be re∣dy made And whan he herde how Thomas and Abbanus hadde done he wolde haue putte hem to dethe but hit happid that his owne brothir was de¦de the same tyme & ther¦fore he putte hem bothe in pryson in to the tyme that he hadde beryed his brothir Thanne as god wolde whan his brothir had longe lay dede he rose from deth to lyfe and tol¦de the kyng that he had seyne his paleyse in para¦dyse that thomas hadde made for hym and prey¦de the kyng that he my¦ght haue hit and he wol¦de yeue hym as moche golde as he toke thomas Thanne the kyng toke his counsell and seyd nay I wll haue it my selfe lette hym make the ano∣thir for his brothir had seyne this paleyce in pa∣radyse made with golde and rayed with preci∣ous stones and clothe of golde. Thanne the kyng toke cristendome and many a thousend with hym and whanne the bishops saw that the kyng and so moche o∣thir
people for soke her lawus and tourned to cristondome they where so wrothe with thomas that one of theym seyde he wolde venge his god and with a spere smote thomes thourghe the bo¦dy and slewe hym Than cristen people beryed hym in a tombe of cri∣stall and there god wo¦te wroughte many mira∣cles for hym For the han¦de that was in cristys sy¦de wolde neuer come in to the tombe but euer lay with oute Also in his te∣chyng and prechyng he taughte Duodecim g∣dua virtutum assig¦nare Primua est vt in deum crederent ui est vnua in es∣sencia et trinua in personi. Dedit eis triplex exemplum sesibile quomodo sint indiuidencia v∣na▪ tre persone▪ Primum est quia vna ē in homine sa∣iēcia et de vna pro¦cedit intellectus. memoria et ingeni¦um memoria est vt non obliuiscaria in tellecto. vt intel∣ligas que ostendi possunt vel doceri ingenium est vt qu∣od didiceri inue∣nias Secundum est quia in vna vinea tria sunt lignum folium et fructus.

Also ther be many meruelous & won¦dre full thynges done on this day for on that day all the countrey comythe the dyr to take pardone of that honde that lythe oute of the tombe in the vse of the bishop of the ci¦te that gothe to masse. And whanne he hathe seyd Confite or thanne he takyth a branche of a vy∣ne and putte hit in to tho¦mas honde that is oute of the tombe and than he gothe forthe to masse and the branche burge∣neth oute grapus and be that tyme the gospel be seyd the grapis be rype than the bishop takythe the grapis and wryngith the wyne in the chales & so singith with the same wyne and hoselyth the people. and whan any man or woman comythe that is not worthy to re¦ceyue this hosell anon the honde closithe to gedyr and wyll not opyn tyll he be shreuen clene and than hit wyl opyn Also yf any people be in deba∣te they shall be broughte be fore thomas tombe & there the cause shall be re¦hersed than woll the hon¦de tourne to hym that is in the ryght and so they be made at one. Thus thomas preuith oure be∣leue
and did many wyn¦tres in his dayes. Also iohan crisostomus seythe that thomas come in to the countre there as the thre kynges of coleyn we¦re and thomas cristened hem for they hadde wor∣shippyd god in his byr∣the And there fore tho∣mas come to hem and taughte hem the feythe & the beleue of criste to that beleue that we may be sa¦uyd god bryng vs all Amen. De natiuita∣te domini nos∣tri Ihesu cris∣ti. GOod men and wymmen as ye heryn and seyn as hooly churche makyth mynde and mencion of the grete myrthe and me lodye of the blessyd birth of oure lord ihesu crist ve¦ry god & man that was this day borne of his mo¦dyr mary in socour of all man kynde But in e spe¦ciall for thre causis Fir∣ste to yeue pese to man of good wyll and to lygh¦te hem that were darcke in synne and for to drawe vs with loue to hym. Thanne as to the firste cause he was borne to ge¦ue men peese of good wyll I may well preue this for whan he was bor¦ne angellys songhe thus Gloria in excelsia deo &c. Ioye be to god in heuen & pese in erth to man kynd of good wyll
At midnighte oure lord was borne for be kynde all thyng was in pees & reste inshewyng that he was and is Princepa pacia Prince of peese & come to make pees be twyxe god and man and be twyxe the angell and man and be twyx man and man And for to be trew mediatour be twyx god and man he toke na∣tur and kynde of bothe and was bothe verray god and man and by his mediacion he knette the loue of god to man so saddely that the fadyr of heuyn sparyd not hym that is his owne but sen¦te hym in to this worlde to bye man kynde with his precious blode thour¦ghe his grete mekenesse to ioye of paradyse that man hadde loste be coue∣tyse of vnbuxsumnes. Thus he made pees be twyx god and man and man and man. for whanne angeles say her lord wrothe with man for his vnbursumnes for it is a synne that angeles hatyn gretly. Ther fore they kepte the gatys of paradyse and wolde let¦te no soule come ynne tyll they say her lord borne of man kynde Thanne a none for loue of our lord the angels did mankynde worshippe & spake good∣ly to mankynde as to the sheperdys that keptyn her shepe in the countre by They bad hem go to the cite of Bethlem and ther they shuld fynde a childe borne and leyde in a crache and bad hem do hym worshippe and so they dedyn And euer syn angelys haue ben frende∣ly to man and lowly end haue done reuerence to mankynde for the incar∣nacion of oure lord ihesu criste. Thus he made pees betwene angelys & man Also he made pees betwene man and man for a yene the tyme that oure lord wolde be borne he made so grete pees that
in all the worlde ther as kyngdomes and coun∣treys were in debate and werred eche with othyr on to the tyme of our lor¦dis birthe. Than there was so grete pees that a man that was callyd oc¦tauian Emperour of ro∣me and he hadde the go¦uernaunce of the worlde for all the world was sub¦iete to rome and hit du∣red. xxx. wynter in so mo¦che that ther was a maū¦ment sente oute from ro∣me in to all the world co¦maundyng to all maner of people shuld go to the cite that he drew lynage of & ley a peny vpon his hede and so offer hit vp in knolechyng that he was sogette to the Em¦perour of rome. Than muste Joseph oure la∣dyes husbonde nedys go to the cite of Bethleem for to offer with othir pe¦ple but for he had no mo¦ney to offer he toke an oxe with hym to selle at the cite to make money to do his dete with but for he durste not leue our lady be hynde hym for she was nyghe her tyme. And there fore he sette her vpon an asse and to¦ke her with hym. And so whanne they come to the cite of Bethleem hit was so full of people so that Joseph and oure lady myghte haue no lo∣gyng but tourned in to a cabon that was made betwyxse two houses the¦re as the people of the countre sette her horses and theyr asses and o∣thir bestis whanne they come in to the towne to the markette and so there they founde a cra∣che with hey And they sette the oxe and the asse ther to and so there they taryed all that nyghte. And whanne hit was a lytyll be fore mydnyght oure lady badde Joseph goo in the towne and lo∣ke her for a myddewyffe whan the tyme was co∣me she shuld be delyuerid
asked her wher ther shul¦de after hym any be bor∣ne that shulde be gretter than he Thanne at myd day Sybill loked in the sonne and there she saye a cercle of gold a boute the sonne Et in medio circuli virgo pulch errima And the myd dys of the cercle a fayre mayden and a childe in her arme with a crowne of gold And whan si∣byll had shewid this to the Emperour she seyd to hym this childe shall be gretter than thos arte or euer were or euer shall be and ther fore do hym worshippe and reueren∣ce Than a none the em∣perour toke ensence and dede worshippe to hym and charged all the peo¦ple to do the same and to calle the childe her god & hym but a man as othir were. Thus all cristen people may lerne to do worshippe and seruice to this childe this day And ther fore the thyrde mas∣se this day is seyd at myd day in tokenyng that cri¦sten people shulde come and offer in the worshi∣ppe of this childe and his modyr and shewen hym seruaunt and suget to hym and knoleche this childe for his lord and his god and eche man shulde come to hym for loue and not for dre∣de And ther fore the of∣fice of the masse this day begynneth thus Puer natus est nohis. A childe is borne to vs he seyth and not a man for all cristen people shulde be bolde and not a ferde to come to hym to haue grace for he is full of gra¦ce and redy to yeue mer¦cy to hem that askith hit mekely with dewe reue∣rence he is euer redy to ye¦ue mercy and grace. In tokenyng that sa∣me day that crist was bor¦ne in Bethleem a welle of water in rome tourned and ranne oyle all that day shewyng that the
well of grace and mer∣cy was borne that day that shuld yeue mercy and grace to all theym that wolde come to hym and aske mercy and gra¦ce and that ye shall here be ensample. we rede of a woman that was defowled in le∣chery and all moste fill in dispayr of drede. for whanne she be thoughte her of the streytenesse of cristes dome and the gre¦ horrible peynes of hell that were ordeyned for soche synners as she was or a ferde and be thou∣ghte her of cristes passi∣on what loue he shew de to all cristen people she thoughte she was vnkyn de to hym and he suffe∣rid so sore for h And than she be thoughte her how children be they ne∣uer so wrothe and shewe neuer so grete vengeaun∣ce how lyghtly they woll sese and for geue where fore this woman a none cryde to Criste preyng hym for his child he de to for geue her and to haue mercy on her and a none she herde a voyce an high in the eyre and seyd thy trespas is for yeuen the Amen.

GOod men and wymmen soche a day ye shall haue an hyghe day and a hoo¦ly feste in the churche of seint Stephen the mar∣tyr the whiche was the firste martyr that suffe∣red dethe for goddis sake after cristes ascension. Than for to stere youre deuocion the more to this hooly martyr. I wyll tell yow somme what that he suffered for cristes sa¦ke as the boke of apost∣lys tellyth Post ascen¦sionem domini. after the ascension of oure lord that he was styedvp in heuen the apostlys labo∣ur was all to preche and to teche the word of god to cristen people And for they where to fewe to serue all the people that

But thoughe a man be neuer so hooly it he shall haue enemyes wherfore of diuerse coun¦treys that hadde enmy∣te to stephene and come ayene hym and disputed with hym for to haue o∣uer come hym with di∣sputacion and for they myghte not they brough¦te false wyttenesse ayenst hym to putte hym to deth But whanne seynte Ste¦phene sawe and knowe her malice anone he thou¦ghte to sese hem be on of these thre weyes othir be shamyng in disputacion or be drede of reuolacion or be preyours of hooly orysones. But firste he seyd be shamyngm di∣sputacione For whanne they be gonne to dispute with hym he was so full of the hooly goste that they hadde no poure nor no myghte for to a gayn sey hym And so he ouer come hem in all her ma∣ters and preued all her maters false that they seyde ayenste And ther for he seyd he was redy to take the dethe in very fiyng of all that he seyd And so putte hem that where grete clerkes and knewe the lawe and the prophecie to grete shame and velonye. But yit they wolde not leue but alwey ayene stode hym.

And so they fretid her hertis withyn hym selfe and grugged with her tethe for anger and how that they my∣ght ouer come hym with disputacion Than they soughte yf they myghte haue take hym with som worde of Cristes dethe where by they myghte ha¦ue made them a cause to haue putte hym to dethe Thanne seynte stephene knewe her malice and lyf¦te vp his eyen into heuen Et vidit celos aper¦tos And he saw heuyn opyn and oure lord ihe su criste sittyng on his fa¦dyr ryght hande redy to helpe hym.

De sancto ioāne euangeliste. GOod frend is so¦che a day ye shall haue an highe fe∣ste in hooly churche the este of seynte Iohan eu∣angeliste the whiche was goddis owne drlyng. where for all hooly chur¦che makithe mynde and mencion of the specialte that once lord gaffe to hym for any othir of his disciples Oure lord gaffe hym grace to kepe his  ginite and of kepyng of his modir and oure lord shewde hym his prynyte He gaffe hym grace to kepe his virginite that is maydynhode. For this story tellith and the peo¦ple haue opynned whan johan shulde wedde ma∣ri maudeleyne criste cal∣lidr
hym and he come & serod hym and johan lefte the worldes vamte & sewed oure lord and so kepte him selfe clene may¦den till he passid oute of this worlde In preuyng of this whanne Domi∣cian the Emperour of Rome herde the people tell that johan preched in a countrey that was callid asia and there jo¦han made to bilde many churches and whan the Emperour herde that he sente aftyr Iohan and made hym be putte in a brayson tonne full of se∣thyng oyle. and whan Iohan hadde longe so∣dyn there ynne that alle the people wende that he had be all to sodyn and dede Thanne the Empe¦rour badde opyn the ton¦ne and whan the tonne was opyn Iohan come oute of the tonne and as e was clene of all synne so was he clene of all ma¦ner of bennyng or har¦me in all parties of his body. A nothir harde tourmēt he had on a day Iohan sawe a temple of iewes and was full of mawmentry and than he preyde to god to di∣stroye hit & a none there with hit fill downe to the grounde all to powdyr. where fore Aristodimus the bishoppe of the tem¦ple was so wrothe that he putte Iohan in to pry∣son Thanne seyde iohan yit wolte thou that y shal make the beleue in ihesu criste Than seyde aristo dimus y woll mak ve∣nym & make hit drynke be fore the & whan thou seyste hem dede drynke thou there of with oute harme & than woll I be¦leue on thy god than seid iohā go & do as thou sey∣ste thā ordeyned the bi∣shopp̄ poyson & fette ij. mē oute prison that were dāpned to drynke of the poyson & anone they we∣re dede thā seyde iohan yf thou yeue venym to drin¦ke y shall call to my god
And than Iohan toke this poyson and blessid hit and dranke there of & he was neuer the worse but rathir semyd the bet¦tyr and the fayrer for as he was clene from synne so he was clene from all grenaunce of the poyson yit seyde the bishoppe he wolde not beleue vn to the tyme he hadde seyne these ij. men arrid from dethe to lyffe that where dede. Thanne johan ca∣ste of his cote and seyde Dade et mitte ac tunicam super cor∣pora defunctorum. Goo and ley this cote vppon the dede bodyes and sey thus Ihesu cri¦stus apostell sente me to yow and bad that ye shul¦de a ryse vp in goddis na¦me and a none they re∣syn to lyffe ayene. Than the bishoppe with many othir tourned and bele¦uyd in criste and johan cristoned hem and af∣tyr the bishoppe was a full hooly man Thus io¦han hadde grace to kept hym clene bothe body & soule and thus he was a martir to fore god in with stondyng of synne Also he was keper of cri¦stus modir for oure lord sawe the grete clennesse that was in Iohan be fo¦re all othir whanne oure lord shulde dye he seyde to Iohan. Ecce ma∣ter tua. See thy mo∣dyr and be toke Iohan the kepyng of his mo∣dir and oure lord seyde to his modir Ecce fi∣lins tuns Se thy sone and so be toke eythir to othir and whanne oure lord was dede and ley in his tombe Iohan to¦ke oure lady home with hym in to his house and kepte her till oure lord hesu criste was a reyson from dethe to lyffe a yen And whan oure lord was stied vp in to heuen he kepte oure lady in the same chambre as longe as she leuyd aftyr thus he had grace of kepyng
of goddis modir Also he hadde grace of know∣yng of cristus p̄uite for this was furste whā oure lord sate at his soper on sherthursday for grete lo¦ue that johan had to our lord Ihesu criste he ley¦de his he de to cristus bre¦ste and in the same wyse as a man leythe his body downe to a welle & dryn¦kithe his body full of wa¦ter righte so johan dran∣ke his soull full of gostly wysedome at cristus bre¦ste and at the same ty∣me oure lord shewed him all his priuyte be fore all othir. And for he was olde and wolde not leue to p̄che the worde of god the Emperour exied Iohan him selfe a lone in to the yle of pache mo And there god shewde hym the apocalippes of the worlde and of the day of dome and as he sawe hit he wrote hit in grete fermacion of hooly churche But aftyr wh he Emperour was dede Iohan was callid ayen in to the Cite of Emphe∣sie for there he was Bi∣shoppe and he come the dyr. And there was a wedowe that highte dru¦siana was dede and leyde on a bere Thanne Io∣han sawe moche people wepe for her and thanne he seyde Drusiana aryse vp and make me som∣me mete and anone she rose and wente for he as she hadde rose from slepe Hit happid on a ty∣me ther were ij. yong men be prechyng of jo¦hā they solde all the good that they hadde and wē¦te forthe with Iohan for they were riche men thā on a day as they come to the Cite of Parga∣me they that were her seruauntes a lite whyle to fore they were well a ayde and where riche men and they were pore men. Thanne by temp∣tacion of the finde they fre thoughte alle theyr
purpose and were soy that they hadde loste her goodis So anone be reue¦latione of god Iohan knowe her purpose and her hertis and seyde he sawe that the sende temp¦ted you and makith you for thynkyng youre pur¦pose that ye were ynne to serue god but go ye to the wode and ethyr of you bryng with hym a bord on of smale yerdys and so they dede. Than thourghe the preyour of Iohan god tourned the yerdis in to gold and than seyde Iohan to hē thus nowe take ye this gold and be ye as riche as ye were to fore and knowe well ye haue loste the kyngdome of heuen Than happid hit that ther was a man dede t same tyme and the mo¦dyr of hym sawe Iohan and a none fill downe on her knees and preyde him that he wolde reyse her sone to lyue as he dede the wedowe drusiana Than preyde johan to god and this dede man ose a yen to lyffe. Than seyd he to hym I bid the tell these ij. men what thou haste seyne and what ioye was ordeyned for hem and how they haue loste hit. And thanne the mā tol¦de of the ioye of parady¦se and of the peynes of purgatory & of hell how stronge and how horri∣ble the were and howe glorious the place was or¦deyned for hem and how sory her good angellis were for they hadde loste that glorious blisse of he¦uen and how moch ioye the fendys made of the tournyng of hem And than the same men were sory and cryde to johan and preyde hym to prey to god for hem and we¦pte sore and johan sawe hem wee he preyde to god for hem and yaffe hem penannce and whan he hadde do so anone the golde tourned in to yer∣dis a yene and aftyr they
were hooly men. A nothir hooly reue∣lacion Johan had shew∣de by the preuyte of god hit happid one a day he sawe a childe that was li ke to haue be a man whe¦re for Johan broughte hym to abishoppe and badde hym kepe the chil¦de and teche hym for in tyme comyng he shall be a man and so this bi∣shoppe kepte hym and whanne he come to man ne state he gae hym all to foly and fill in com∣pany of heuys and in a whyle aftir he was a ma stir theffe and the leder of hem Than be reuela∣cion of god johan knew all this well y now and come to the bishoppe & askyd hym where this childe was and the Bi∣shoppe tolde hym. than Johan blamed hym & seyde that he hadde mis∣gouerned the childe Thā Johan was olde & my∣ghte not well goo h toke in horse and rodè there as thefeo were and whanne thyffe sawe Jo¦han anone he fleye a wey than Johan wode aftyr hym and cried & seyde Quid fugia O fili mi. thow my sone why fleiste thi fadir a byde me dere sone and speke with me thi fadir that is olde and may not well goo & than at the laste this mā a bode Thanne johan p̄ ched so that he lefte his foly and aftyr was so ho¦ly a man that he was bi∣shoppe aftir. Thus had johan reuelacion of god dis preuite. Hit is wreton in the lyffe of seinte Edward the confessour that lyhe at wesomestre that seynte Johan the euangeliste ap pered to seint Edward as he wente a procession at the halowyng of the churche seinte johan ap∣pered to hym in the like¦nesse of a palmer & prey¦de the kynge of good for
seint johānes loue the eu angeliste for the kyng lo¦ued seint Johan well but hit happid that the kyng hadde no thyng redy there but as he toke a'rynge of his fingir and gaffe him and so seynte johan had the ringe vij yere aftir and thā seynte iohan appered to ij. kny¦ghtes of the kynges that were be yonde the see to∣wardes iherusalem and ashyd hē how the kyng ferde and bade grete hym well on this tokyn & to∣ke hem the ringe & aske the kyng for whose loue he gaffe that a wey & bid him make him redy for he shall dye sone & so he dede A nothir fayre reuel cion he hadde whanne he was sixti wynter olde & vij Than oure lord ihe su come to him with his disciples & seyde thus. Deni diecte min tēpus est ut in mea mensa cum frati∣ha tuis epularia Come my welbelouyd derlyng for now hit is tyme that thou come & ete with thy bretheren in my borde or in my feste. than iohan rose vp ano wolde haue go forth with him thā seyde oure lord to him vpon sonday thou e be with me Thau by sonday he was passing feble Die dominico conuenit ad iohan∣nem uniuersa mul∣titudo populi So on the sonday ther come to iohan a grete multitude of people & thā iohā ma∣de hem to lede him to the churche and as he my∣ghte speke he seyde to hē that ledde hym thus. In fide essetia sta hiles et in manda∣tia dei feruentea Be ye stable & sad in the feythe & feruent in the cō¦maundementis of god Thanne seyde on of hē to him why sey ye thus ofte to vs than seyde be yf ye loue to gedyr and

Sanctorum inno tum GOod frendys  che a day is callid Innocentes day somme people cale but childre masse day for chil¦dren were slayue that day for Cristus sak they be callid innocentes that is to sey with oute synne for they dede no syn for god is euer gretely  with synne and in speci¦all with proude people  yense her neyboes do∣yng hem wronge The¦se innocentes dede neuer syns  onsentyng to synne where for I may well sy that they leuyd here with oute shame & dd with oute blame & were cristoned in her
owne blode at home and somme in her▪ moderes armes. Hooly churche as this day singithe and redithe in the worshippe of these innocētes for they were with ynne ij. yere of age and there for they we¦re not a shamed of her owne shappe for they we¦re not defowled with no maner spotte of synne. but the synne that they had of the drawte of kyn¦de of oure fadyr Adam and Eue. For Adam and Eue were in the sa¦me wyse in paradyse the state of innocentrie fore they where nakyd but they were not ashamed of her shappe all the whi¦le the were with oute syn but as sone as they hadde do synne anon they sawe her owne shappe and we¦re ashamed there of and couered her shapp̄ with leuys of a figge tre Right so when synn begynnyth to take roode in a childe than innnocensie gothe a wey from hym for he kno withe good from ille & ille from good and le∣uith the good and do∣the ille than he synnethe and than he is not inno¦cent no lenger for thanne greuithe he god. But these children leuyd not so lōge to knowe that on from that othir but we∣re slayne with ynne age of innocentrie where fore they leuyd her lyffe with oute shame and blame For kyng herowde the kyng of iewis made to sle hem with oute gylte. For whan the iij. kyngis come to kyng herowde and seyde to hym Obi est ni natua ē re indeorum where is he that is home kyng of e wis and badde hym tell hem for they wre come to worshipp̄ hym fer ou¦te of the Este. Thanne wa kyng herowde foule a stoyned of her word is and askyd his clerkys where this childe shulde be borne and they seyde in Bethleem inde And
thanne kyng herowde tol¦de hem so and bad hem goo thethir and worship¦pe hym and come ayen by me that I may go & worshippe hym. also and so the kynges wente the∣thir and worshippid cri¦ste and whan they hadde done here offerynges to criste Per aliam ni reuersi sunt in re∣gionem suam By an othir wey they tourned home ayen For the An¦gell bad hem do so in her slepe Than was kyng herowde wondyr wrothe and anone ordeyned to sle ceiste and whanne he had made all redy there to hit happid so that the Emperour of rome sen¦te aftyr hym for to come to hym in all the haste y• he myghte for .n. of his owne sonnes hadde accu¦sid hym to the Empe∣rour of treson Than he¦rowde lefte all his pur∣pose of criste as at that tyme and rode to rome and hadde the better of his sones and come ho∣me ayen with more wor¦shippe than he hadde to fore But yit he thoughte all wey to sle criste lefte criste hadde come to mā¦nes astate and wolde ha¦ue putte him oute of his kyngdome. Than sente he a none and had sle all the children that were in Bethleem and in all the countrey a houte that we¦re with in ij. yere of age & that were borne same day & so they dede. For kyng herowde was goyng and comyng & so taryyng ij. yere & there for he made sle all that euer wer with ynne ij. yere of age And for he was so vengable in party hit fill on hym sel¦fe for a childe of his own was slayne amonge othir the same tyme But ther come an Angell to Jo¦seph & seyde to hym Ac¦cipe puerum et ma¦trem eius et fuge in egiptum Take the childe and his modir & fle in to egipte & be there
and so he dede Thus in∣nocētes were slayne with oute blame & they were not ashamed of theyr owne shappe & they we∣re cristoned at home in her owne blode & not in no fonte. There fore ye shall vndyrstonde that there is thre maner of cri¦stonyng One is in wa¦ter as we be cristonyd in the fonte Anothir is as these children were cristo¦ned in her owne blode & a thowsand martirres mo that shedde her blode for cristus sake The iij. cristonyng is in the feith in the whiche all patriar¦kes & prophetes & othyr holy faderis that were be¦fore the incarnacione of oure lord ihesu criste y• beleued verely in the co¦myng of crisce the were cristoned in the feythe Thus ye may see what enmyte this tirunt king herowde had to shede so many childerens blode for cristus sake that trespa∣ced not to hym nor to none othir. There wep∣te many a modir for ther children at that tyme but god wroughte full feyre for hem & that tyraunte shewde enmyte & hit fille on him selfe for as he par¦tyd an appell with the same knyffe he slewe him selfe Thus he was glad to shede blode giltelese. & there for atte the laste he shedde his owne, blode. For he that is with oute mercy & euer vengeable ofte tyme vengeaunce fal lithe on hym selfe And he that loueth to do mer¦cy shall haue mercy. And this I may preue by ensample. We fynde in the lyffe of seint Siluestre how Cō¦stantyne the Emperour was mesell and by coū¦sell of his lechis he made to gadyr iij. thowsand children for to be sleyne & all her blode shulde be gadered in to a ssell & the Emperour shuld be athi all hote ther ynne
till hit were olde. Than these children were gade¦red in to a place & the em¦perour come ridyng in his chayre. but whan he come nyghe there as the moderes of the children were the moderis of the children weptyn & cry  dyn & made grete weymē tacion on the Emperour & made a derefull noyse. Than askyd the empe∣rour what women they were that made that wey mentacion & the people seyde they were the mode¦ris of the children y• shul¦de e dede for to hele him Than seyde the Empe¦rour hit where a delefull dede of vs alle to make thus many to be slayne that be fayre bodyes to hele on fowle body & I am but one man as ano¦thir is & many of these her aftyr may be full go∣od men & worthy & stōde the Emperour in good stede. ay seyde the em¦perour I woll not do so but late euery woman ta¦ke her childe a yen home with her for they shal not be dede for me. And thā were the wymmen glad & mery & toke her childrē with grete ioye to hem & wente home. Than the nyghte aftyr as this em∣peroure lay in his edde Petyr & poule come to hym & seyde for the grete compassion & pite y• thou haddiste on the wymē & her children there for sen¦de aftyr seint Siluestre & e criston & thou shalte be hole & so he dede & as sone as he was cristoned the lepre fill in to the wa¦ter & he was clene fayre & hole. Thus ye may see how he that woll do mer¦cy shall haue mercy and they that dothe vengeaū∣ce shall haue vengeaunce So did herowde venge∣aunce & hit fill vpon him selfe & Constantyne the Emperour did mercy & he had mercy & grace I hope for euer more and so muste we all Amen
De sancto thoma epō Catuarien̄. GOod men and wymmen soche a day ye shall ha∣ue set Thomas day that was slayne for the righte of hooly churche and the lawe of this lon¦de. This hooly mā seint thomas was borne in the Cite of london & his a∣dir was callid Gilbert that was shryue of lon∣don. Than aftyrward he ordeyned hym selfe & yode in to e hooly lon¦de & there  was take & putte in p Than co¦me a worshippefull wo∣man to hym and sryde yif he wolde lighte her his trouthe to wedde her she wolde helpe him and
bryng hym oute of dis∣sese and he dede so Thā come gilbert home in to Englond and whanne this woman sawe her ty¦me she come aftyr and mette in london at the churche of poules Thā Gilbert made the bishop̄ to criston her and aftir ward for to wedde hem to gedyr and gilbert ga¦te seint Thomas on this woman. So whan scho was with childe she dre∣myd in a nyghte that she come to seint poules chir¦che but whan she wolde haue gone ynne she thou¦ghte her wombe was so grete that she myght not in to the churche by noo wey Thanne on the mo rowe she wente n to her confessour and tolde him all the dreme than seyde he dame be glad & than¦ke god highely for thou haste a childe in thy body that all holy chirche shal be to litill to resceyue him Thanne was she glad and thankyd god hi∣ghely and so sone aftyr this childe was borne & was callid thomas. thā he wexed a man and so he was a man in all degre for he serued the kyng manly and serued god worthely and deyde fore the lewis of hooly chur∣che mekely I may well sey he serued the kyng manly for whan he was made chaunceler of En glond this londe was so full of outeland men and so sore ouer sette with hē that ther myghte no mā goo by the wey vn rob∣bed. But in short ty∣me aftyr Thomas with his wysdome and his manhode he drofe them oute of this londe that all the people myghte goo vn robbed. Thomas wa also manly in repey∣ryng of the kynges ma¦neres that were lette dou¦ne and destroyed and in specyall the kynges pa¦leyse in london at west∣mestre that was all lette falle downe But betwe∣ne
Estye and witsonty de thomas made to repay¦re hit a yene for he hadde there so many workemen of diuerse craftys that a man shulde onethe here his felowe speke for don¦nyng of strokys. He was also manly in dedis of armes for there as the kyng hadde many Ca∣stellis and townes oute of his hondis and he spē¦te moche good to gete theym and shedde moch blode for gete hem a yene at the furste and they we¦re holde oute of his hon¦dis Than thomas with his witte and wisedom gete hem a yene Also whan he was in the kyn¦ges werres of fraunce he quyte hym so manly that whanne the kyng of en¦glond had exiled tho∣mas the kyng of fraun¦ce was his chefe helpe & socoure Also thomas was as manfull in his a∣ray for he was clothyd in the beste and richeste clothe and furre that my¦ghte be founde And al∣so his repayre to his ho∣se sadeles brydele shon as bryghte as any siluer he was also manfull in his housholde for hi hall was euery day in some cheson strawed with gr¦ne ruschis And in wyn∣ter with clene hey fore to saue the knyghtes clothis that sate in the flore for de awte of place to sitte o for there come so many euery day to ete of his mete and drynke for he wolde haue of all maner of deyntes that myghte he founde in thi londe In so moche that the kyng hym selfe many ty¦me vnwarned come to Thomas to mete bothe for loue that he had to Thomas and also to see the aray and also re∣uell that was in thomas housholde for there spke so moch people worship¦pe by Thomas. And where fore more trewer and also better loue that thanne was betwene
the kyng and thomas while hit laste was neuer betwene to men. where for I putte this ensam∣ple Hit happid that hit fill in a colde wynter as the kyng and Tho¦mas come rydyng to ge¦dyr in to chepe side at lō¦don the kyng was ware of a pore man that was well nere nakyd & had no clothis and was sore a colde Thanne seyd the kyng to thomas hit we¦re a grete almesse dede to yeue to this pore man be¦tyr clothes Sire seid tho¦mas of soche ye shulde ta¦ke hede Thanne had tho¦mas on a clothe of good scarlet and well furryd with riche furre than the kyng leyde hōde on this clothe and wolde haue pullid hit from thomas for to haue yeue it to this pore man but thomas hel¦de hit faste and thus they wrastelid longe in so mo¦che that they were like to fulle to the grounde. but at the laste be fauour tho¦mas suffered the kyng to take his clothe of and than the kyng caste hit to the pore man and bad hym renne a wey faste & selle hit and bey hym o∣thir and yf thou be sette hit well thou mayste fare the better euer whiles thou leuyste Than tho∣mas fayned hym selfe wrothe but in his hert he was welle a payde that his roue was so well be∣fette Thanne the peple meruelyd gretely furste what was betwene the kyng and thomas but whan they saw what hit mened the people were glad and had grete spor¦te there of. This I sey to shewe ensample howe well they louyd to ge∣dyr thus thomas serued the kyng manfully. also we muste lerne of oure hooly patron seynte tho∣mas to serue god deuou¦tely. whanne he serued god full deuoutly for as sone as he was made arch bishoppe of Caunterbu∣ry
a none he tourned his leuyng in to better le∣uyng and thoughte to serue the kyng of heuē as well as he hadde the kyng of this worlde be fore.

Thanne sede thomas I charge the that thow tell hit neuer to no man whyle y am a lyue no mo¦re he dede but whan tho∣mas was dede he tolde it opynly to all the people Thus I may well sey that thomas serued god deuoutly.

De circumcisiōe domini. GOod frendis so che a day is cal∣lid new yeris day and is the firste day of the begynnyng of the Newe yere that is co∣myng and is the laste day of the yere that is go¦ne. And there fore this day ye shall come to god and hooly churche to here youre deuyne seruice forthe this yere. For like as a good seruaunt that hathe a good mastir ma¦kithe his comenaunt but ones but holdithe forthe from yere to yere hauing full truste in his maistre that he woll for his good seruice yeffe hym a good towarde in his grete nede

Also hit is callid Cir∣cumcisi mini the circumcision  our lord Also this day is callid new yeris day for this day is the firste day of the ka lendyr & the yere gothe moche he kalendyr there for his is callid new yeris day Seinte Austein seith this day & this nyghte he thyn people vse many fal¦se opynions & wyche craf¦tys and false be leue the whiche be not to telle a¦mong cristen people les te they tourned to that vse where fore ye that be cristē people be well we¦re lefte ye be desceyued be any false soery as be ta∣kyng counsell of on mā be fore a nothir or in be∣yng or sellyng or in bo¦rowyng or senyng in the whiche somme haue diuerse opimons. And yf they be well shreuyn they be worthy for to ha¦ue grete penaūce for ther misse beleue for that co∣mythe of the fende and not of god This day is callid the circumcisione of oure lord for as holy chuche tellith this day he was circumsised & blede his blode for oure sake for whan the flesche was cut¦te he blede faste & was full ore for he was but yong and tendyr and but viij dayes olde & there fore he blede the more. Thanne ye shall vnderstonde that he bledde v. tymes fore vs. ni enim i cia saguin s∣ pro nobi effdit
The firste tyme that he shedde his blode was as this day whan he was cir¦cumcised. A nothir was for fer of his passione for righte as a childe wepith for fere whā he seethe the rodde & hathe no harme so the flesche of our lord swede blode for drede of a strenger passion that was comyng. The thridde tyme was in his flagella cion▪ whan he was betyn with stourges so that all his body ranne on redde blode. The fourthe ty∣me was whā he was nay led honde & fote on the crosse. The fifte tyme was whā that longinus perisched his herte with a spere that watyr & blo∣de come oute of his woū¦des And than they toke vp the crosse with the bo¦dy & lifte hit vp on highe & with a sodeyne fall they lette the crosse fall doune in to the mortesse that all the senowis & vynes and ioyntes braste a two and blode & watyr come out of euery wounde this he suffered for vs Thāne seethe criste was cicumci¦sed and shedde his blode thus for vs y• was with outyn synne & circumci∣sion is for synne remedy & helpe why wolde he be circumcised that did no synne Sanctus augu stiuua dicit rop∣terquator causa Seint Austeyn seth hit was for foure causes. the firste was to make a see∣the with the iewes for el¦se they wolde & myghte haue seyde that he hade be of her lawe where for they wolde not resceyue him consente to his te∣chyng. this was to dis∣ceyue the fende For right as the fende disceyued a dam & Eue and so all mankynde was damp∣ned So hit fill to criste to disceyue the fende whe¦re thourghe all mankyn¦de myghte be saued. than whau the fende saw that he was circumcised as a noir childe he wende y•
he hadde take that penaū¦ce in remedy of originall synne. and so he knowe hym not frome a nothir childe for yf he had know hym verely that he had rome to haue bought mā¦kynde he wolde neuer ha¦ue tysed the iewes to ha¦ue putte criste to dethe. And this was all the cau¦se that our lady was wed¦did to Joseph for to di¦sceyue the fende for the fen¦de shulde wende that Jo¦seph had be his fadir and not consceyued of the ho¦ly goste The thrydde cause why he was circū∣cised that was in confer¦myng the olde lawe in grete comforte to the ol∣de fadres y• were of the ol¦de testament fore & yf he hadde be cristoned and not circumcised hit had be a grete discomforte to all that were be fore the incarnation of oure lord ihesu criste The four∣the cause of his circum∣cision was for oure lord woste well that ther wol¦de come heretikes aftyr that wolde haue seyde y• criste had a body of the erthely fantesy and not of flesche and blode as on of vs haue for a body of the eyere may not ble¦de And there for to put a wey alle soche errours criste was circumcised and blede in his cut tyng of his flesche the whiche flesche was cutt from his membre an angell aftyr brought hit to kyng char¦les for the moste precious relike in the worlde and for the gretteste worship¦pe that he owde do ther to he broughte hit to ro∣me to a churche that is callid Saneta sanc∣torum For these iiij. causes criste was circum¦cised This day also hit is callid the vtas of the natiuite that is the viij. day of oure lordis birthe in grete tokenyng to all vs that bethe good ser∣uauntes to thynke on the¦se viij. dayes that folow∣ith the birthe The fir∣ste
day is to thynke y∣wardly on the sede that we were conceyued of that is fowle and abo∣mynable in hit selfe that as a man or a woman be they neuer so feyre that & they sawe the mater they wolde haue be a shamed of hym selfe to thynke  he were euer conceyued of that foule thynke. The secounde day is to thynke how greuous∣ly he aynithe his mo∣dir in his birthe in so mo¦che that hit is an grete mi¦racle of god that she may haue her lyffe The iij day is to thynke how fe∣ble and howe wreched he is borne for all the be∣stis of kynde somwhat cā helpe hem selfe sau man kynde he nothir may nor can helpe hym selfe in no degre but dye a none but he hadde helpe & socoure of othir. The iiij. day is to thynke in how mo∣che parell and drede he leuithe here fore in ery place dethe folowith him and is euer redy to falle on hym what tyme newe¦re no man knowithe but only god hym selfe In certum est locua in quo mor te exspe∣ctat. It is in certeyne the place there as dethe a bidithe the The v. day is for to thynke how hor¦rible dethe is whanne he comythe for in shorte spa¦ce and tyme he makyth a man to stinke that alle the beste frendis that he hathe be a vysed to put hym in to the erthe and hyde hym there. The vi. day is to thynke how rewfull is the departyng of the body and the sou¦le that may not be depar¦ted till the he rte in the body brke fore drede of the sightes that the sou∣le shall see that for grete fere the he rte brekyd. O mor quam amara est memoria tua. O thow dethe howe bit∣ter it is to thynke vppon whanne thw arte co∣myng to any man.
The vij. is to thynke how dredefull is the do∣me that he shall goo to a none and howe streyte his iugement shall be thā he that woll thynke one these vij. dayes besely on the viij. day I hope he shall be circumcised that is he shall be cutte a wey from the luste of his fle∣sche and of synne and so do parte from this worl∣des likkyng. and thus comyth the viij. day that is the tas of criste that is the ioye of blysse that shall neuer haue ende to the whiche god bryng vs all to Amen. Judie epiphanie GOod frendis this day is callid the xij. day but hit is the xiij. day of cristus bir¦the The whiche day ho¦ly churche callid hit the Epiphania domini that is to sey the shewing of oure lord ihesu criste verray god and mā for this day he was shewed verray god and man be thre offerynges be his cri¦stonyng and also be tour¦nyng of water in to wy¦ne. The xiij. day of his birthe be offeryng of the thre kynges and that sa¦me day xxx. wynter and xiij. dayes aftyr his bir∣the he was cristened in the water of flom Jor∣dan and that same day twelfemonthe aftyr he tourned water in to wy¦ne at the weddyng of ca¦ne galilee. But the feste makythe moste mynde and mencion of the iij. kynges offerynge and there late vs folowe the forme of hooly churche. & here ye shall here howe hit fill of her offeryng to oure lord Jhesu criste verray god and man These thre kynges whe∣re of the lynage that pro¦phecied how a sterre shul¦de shyne of Jacob but they were noo iewes of
kynde but they hadde her¦de by prophecye of this where fore the hadde gre∣te desire and usce to see hit and so oftyn tyme whanne myghte come to gedyr vppon certeyne hi¦ghe hilles than they wol∣de dispute amonge hem of this sterre So hit hap¦pid vppon Cristemas nyghte the same tyme as oure lord was borne they were to gerdyr and we∣re disputyng of this ster¦re Super mōtem au¦ctorelē. vpon the hill Dominna enim e¦rat ata Oure lord was borne Et appar it illis And apperid to hem in the sterre as fayre a childe and vndyr his hede a bryghte crosse of golde and seyde thus to hem goo ye a none in all the haste that ye may in to the londe of iury & tae with yow Gold mir¦re and ensence And of¦fer these thre thynges to hym that ye shall fynde there newe born kynge of Iewes verray god and man and I shall be youre gyde and lede yow the wey. Thanne they a none for grete ha∣ste they toke bestys that be callid dromedaries that be of soche a kynde they be so swifte that they woll renne further in on day than any othir beste wolle renne o go in thre dayes And so they co∣me to Iherusalem that was the chee Cite of all iury hopyng that they shulde here there somme tydinges where that this childe was borne. But as sone as they tourned in to the Cite of Iheru¦salem thanne they loste the sighte of the Sterre that ladde hem euer the wey till that they come the dyr bryghter thanne the sonne Thanne whā they come in to the Ci∣te of iherusalem they ro¦de to kyng he rowde for he was there the same
tyme and seyde to hym bi est qui natua ē¦re indeorum where is he that is borne that is kyng of iewes. idi∣mus enim stellam eius in oriente. we sawe his sterre in the este eniemus adorae eum we be come to wor¦shippe hym. Thanne kyng he rowde was trou¦beled and all the Cite with hym but more fore flateryng of hym man of any loue that they had to hym Thanne kyng he rowde askyd his cler∣hys where this child shul¦de be bore and they seyd in Bethleem de. Thā kyng herowde askid the kynges p̄uely of the ster¦re and bad hem goo in to Bethleem and wor∣shippe the childe and co¦me ayene by hym and telle hym where he my∣ghte fynde the childe that he myghte goo worship∣pe hym. Thanne whan the kynges where passed towardes bethleem a nō the sterre aperid to hem and whanne they sawe the sterre was come ayen they were glad in theyr hertys and as hit is in many places peynted the kyng that is in the myd¦dell for grete loye of the sterre he lokyd bacwarde to his felow be hinde hm & with his finger shewid hym the sterre And that is the cause that the myd¦dyll kyng lokyd bacwar¦de. And thus the sterre broughte hem to bethleē and whan the sterre co¦me ouer the house there as oure lord was ynne he stode stille Than the kynges lyghted downe and yede in to the house and with all the reueren¦ce that they cowde kny∣lyng a downe and offe∣red eche of he in these iij thynges Anrum tus∣se et mirram Golde cense and mirre knowle¦chyng by the golde that he was kyng of all kyn¦ges And by the ncense that he was verrey god
And by the myrre that he was verey man & sho∣lld be dede & leyde in gra¦ue with cte roting. For golld is chefe of all metallis Ensens is bren¦te in holy chirche in wor¦shippe to god. Mirre is an oyntement that ke¦pithe dede bodies frome tyng. Thus whanne the kynges had do her offeryng be techyng of the angell Per altam viam reuersi sunt in regionem suam By a nothir wey they wente towardes her own londes and lefte kyng herowde. and the ster vanisched a wey from hem. Thanne as seynte Bernard seythe ioseph kepte of this gold as mo¦che as him nedith to his tribute that he shuld pay to the Emperour and also more to kepe oure la¦dy with whyle she lay in childe bedde and the re∣menaunte be delid to po¦re people soche as hadde grete nede there to. The sence he brente to putte  way the stenche of the sta¦ble there as she lay ynne. And with the Mirre oure lady a noynted her childe to kepe hym from wormes and disseses But what be fill of the kynges aftyr I fyn¦de nothyng in certayne but somme people haue an opynyone howe that seynte Thomas of In∣de Cristoned hem whā he come in to that coun¦trey of Inde. and than as the sterre lyghtenyd hem to cristus birthe So the hooly goste lygh¦tenithe hem in her soules and taughte theym the perfyte wey of the be le∣ue and also of perfite & gracious leuyng in so mo¦che that they lefte all her kyngdome and wente forthe one pilgrrmages that is for to say to Ihe¦rusalem and in many o∣thir places and so they come forthe to myllayne and there they diede alle thre. And so aftyr that
they were translatid to coleyne and there they be yit. Nowe haue ye herde by these thre kyn∣ges how oure lord ihesu criste was this day shew¦ed verray god & man where for like as they of∣fered with grete deuociō so shulde ye do youre of∣ferynges whan ye come to holy churche kneling doune with all the reue∣rence that ye can or may not on youre one kne as to a temperall lord but on bothe youre knees & do hym worshippe with good preyoures Than offer ye preciouse golde for there is no golde so p̄∣cious as is the good pre∣youre deuoute And than holde vp your hondis to hym with all the reueren¦ce that ye can and deuou¦te herte prey to hym and shewe hym all youre loue of youre hertes and than ye offer to hym ensence. For there is none ensen∣ce sauerithe so swete byr¦nyng in the fyre as dothe good preyoure that is de¦uoutly seyde with a byr∣nyng loue in clene chari¦te And yf thou do thus than thou offereste kne∣lyng on thy knees ma∣ke a crosse on the erthe & kysse hit and thinke well thou arte but erthe. than muste ye offer mirre for right as mirre kepithe a body from rotyng so the mynde of dethe kepithe a mannes soule from ded¦ly synne in this wyse doo ye youre offeryng and than shall ye haue as mo¦che mede as had the se iij kynges. Also he was shewed bothe god and man at his cristonyng For he come to the wa∣ter of flom Iordan he wente in to the water & halowed hit for right as he was circumcised to conferme the newe lawe and for no nede that he hadde ther to for he was clene with oute synne but for to make the sacramēt that shulde wasthe hem toke cristonyng in his
name from all synnes Thanne was iohā bap∣tiste redy there & moche people with hym that co¦me thethir to the cristo nyng. Than seyd Io¦han to oure lord all qua kyng and tremelyng. blessid lord thou arte god dislambe with oute syn thou haste no nede to be cristoned of me but that I  man gotyn & borne in synne haue nede to co¦me and be cristoned of in remission of synnes Thanne seyde oure lord criste jhesu johan suffer at this tyme for thus we muste fulfille alle righte wisneste and iohan cri∣stoned oure lord ihesu criste and as hit is credi¦ble oure lady was cristo∣ned aftyr with othir of cristus disciples and all the people that were co∣me thedyr Than whan all were cristoned oure lord wente oute of the watyr and as he wente oute of the brynke of the watyr and all the people with hym Apertisūt eli heuen opened and a grete lighte be clipped hym in sighte of alle the people the hooly gost co¦me downe in likenesse of white doue and lightid on cristus hed and the fadir spake & seyde thus in heryng of all the peo¦ple Hir est filiu mena dilectua in quo michi bene com¦placui.

Hit happit so the people ac∣kyd wyne at the mete.
Thanne badde our lord that they shulde take vi. steues or pottys that we¦re empty and bad fill hē with watyr and they did Thanne oure lord bles¦sed hem and bad they sholde ere theym that be ganne the table and late hym begynne and than he be ganne and seyd hit was the beste wyne that euer he dranke.

Thanne on a day he disputed with seynte Stephyn and for he myghte not ouer co∣me hym he be thoughte hym how he myght brin¦ge hym to his dethe and so he lefte hym neuer till he was dede Thanne hit is the maner of the fen∣des children whan they haue done a cursed dede to be glad & fayne there of prowde in her hertis and encrese her malice o was saule gladde of the dethe of seynte Stephyn and fore he wolde haue gotyn him a name of wic¦kednesse passing all his felowes he wente to hem that had the iewes lawe to kepe and gete hym a letter of warraunt for to take all that be leued in in criste where they my∣ghte be founde & to bryn¦ge hem to Jherusalem for to be putte to the deth there. Thanne whan e hadde these lettres he to∣ke soch a pryde ther with and enuye in his herte a yenste cursten peple that
whan he herde any man speke of hem a none fore grete angre he wolde sne∣fet the nose and frothe at the mouthe for anger and grugge with his te∣the thretenyng and ma¦sesseynge towardis hem that all Cristen people was sore a ferde of hym. Thanne on a day he her¦de that in the Cite of da¦maske was moche cristē people hidde for drede & rode the dyr wardes but a none oure lord ihesu cri¦steshewed the swetenesse of his grate whanne this saule was in his highpri¦de and in wylle to haue do moste harme Than a boute midday oure lord caste a lyghte of grace a boute that was moche ly¦ghter thanne the sonne & the lyghte spake to saule thus.

For fothe all that herde hym were a stoy∣ned and seyde that hit was a grete miracle and grace of god and his o deyne conuersion for he  was of so cursed leuyng so litell be fore was o so∣ne tourned to god and man Thus may ye here how grete miracle god shewde in his conuersion and how grete ioye hoo¦ly chirche makyth of his defendyng hit was gre∣te ioye to all cristen peo∣ple that was a litill be fo¦re to distroye cristen peo¦ple & a non aftyr as besy to encrese cristen people▪ And he that was so be∣sy & so glad to shede cri∣sten mennes blode. than was he so redy to shede his blode for hem.

GOod frendis so¦che a day ye shall haue candelmas day that day makith m¦de and mencion of oure lady & of her sone & speci¦yally iij thingis oure la∣dyes purificacion in sime onis metyng and in cā¦dles offeryng. This day is callid the purifi∣cacion of oure lady in en∣glische hit is the clensing of oure lady but fore noo nede that she had there to fore sche was clensid with the worchyng of the hooly goste in concey¦uyng of her sone that there was in her no ma∣ner of spotte of filthe. But for that day was the xl. day from the birthe of her sone and was callid in the iewes lawe the day of the purificacione not only for oure lady but for all othir wymmen whe∣re fore we calle hit the pu¦rificacion of oure lady The lawe of the iewes was soche that a woman that was delyueryd of a man childe was holde vn¦clene vij. dayes aftyr thā the lawe gaue her leue to go to her husbonde. but yit she was vnclene xxxiij day but till xliiij. dayes were fullfilled she shulde holde her with oute the churche with her offe∣ryng And the offering▪ in those dayes was of a riche man a lambe and for a pore mā s a pey¦re of turtyll doues or el∣les othir doues and so offered oure lady with her sone And yf a wo∣man be delyueryd of a mayden childe she shulde duble all those same day¦es a fore sayde that is for to say the comyng to her husbonde. and also the comyng to the tem¦ple and so this is there son there of For hit is so that all grete clerkys sey that hit to vij. dayes af∣tyr whanne a woman ha¦the conceyued a mānes childe or that the same se¦de tourne in to blode. And hit is also .xxxiij.
dayes aftyr o it tourne to any shappe of man. & than god sente lyffe in to hit and yf hit be a may∣de childe hit doublithe all the dayes bothe in tour∣nyng in to the blode & also in shappe of body & this is the cause. eue that was the furste ormyd woman that er wra∣thid oure lord more thā did the mā Adam ther¦fore she is lenger in for∣myng Thus fore flesch¦ly complexion of man & woman she is vn clene in her selfe there for this pu¦rificacion is ordeyned But vnderstondith well that oure lady had no ne¦de to this clensing fore she conceyued not with complexion of man but only of the holy gosce so that she was clene of all maner of filthe touching consent of man But yit she wente to the temple no othir wymmen dede specyally for iiij. causes. The firste was to fullfil¦lethe scripture that seyth thus Quanto mai∣e tato te humili∣e The higher that thou arte in degre the mekyr thou shuldee make the Thus did oure lady for she wyste well sche was modir to goddis sone of heuen and had so grete worshippe passyng alle othir wymmen yit sche made her as the poreste woman that was in the company. The secoū¦de cause was as she full∣fillithe the lawe of circū¦cision of her sone in the same wyse she fullfillid the purificacion and in offeryng of her sone in the temple doyng for him as othir pore wymmen did for her children. The thridde cause for to stoppe the iewes mou¦thes left they had seyde that she had not do the lawe and so caughte a grete sclaundre a yense h̄ē in tyme comyng. The fourthe cause was for to yeue ensample to all othir wymen that
they shulde come to chir¦che aftyr the birthe of her childe & thanke god that he hathe sauyd hem from dethe in her traue∣lyng for in that tyme a woman is in grete parell of dethe for there is noo sikenes in the world that gothe so nyghe dethe fore these causes hooly chur∣che makythe mynde of oure ladyes purificacion Hit makythe mynde al∣so of the comyng of sy¦meon and Anne Sy¦meon ille senex din vixerat ine etas co¦operatur Anne This symeon was a pas¦sing olde man but he had preyde to god besely all his lysse that he shuld ne¦uer dye till he had seyne criste bodely in this worl¦de and so he dede And this Anne hathe preyde the same Also ye shall vn¦derstonde that this was not ine oure ladyes mo dir but an othir āna▪that had a husbonde vij. yere and whan her husbon∣de was dede she wold not be weddid no more but leuyd till she was lxxx. yere olde and serued god in the temple nyghte and day and preyde to se god or she dyede & oure lord grauntid her. Thanne whan oure lady come into the temple with her sone the hooly goste war¦ned symeon and Anne and a none they with moche ioye wente a yen∣ste hym and broughte hym in to the temple Et Symeon accepit¦eum in uluaa sna. And symeon toke him in his armes with all the reuerence that he cowde and myghte and seyde.  dimittis ser¦num tuum domine secundum nerhum num in pace & cete¦ra. O thow lord nowe for yeue thy seruaunt af∣tyr thy word in pese. and so with all the worshipp̄ and reuerence that he cou¦de he louyd & thākid him that he wolde lete hym
leue so long to see hym bodely with his eyē wher in mynde of this whan a woman comythe to chir¦che of a childe she a by∣dithe at the churche do∣re till the preste come & caste hooly water on her and takythe her in by the honde in to the churche yeuen her leue aftyr to come to churche and to goo to her husbonde for and they haue comened to gedyr be fore they mu¦ste bothe shreyue hē ther of and take her penaun¦ce Also hooly chirch ma¦kythe mynde of candels offeryng and as ye see hit is a comyn vse for all cristen people that be of conuenient age to come that day to churche and bere a candell brennyng in procession as thoughe they wente bodely with oure lady. But nowe ye shalle here howe this worshippefull feste was firste founde Somme ty¦me whanne the Romay¦nes by grete myghte and viall power conquered all the world fore they hadde grete dominacion they were so prowde that they for gete her god and made hem diuerse god∣dis aftyr her owne luste And so among all they hadde a god that they called Mars that had be to fore a notable kny∣ghte in batayle And so they preyde to hym fore helpe and fore they wol¦ spede the better of this knyghte the people prey¦de and did grete wor∣shippe to his modir that was called februa aftyr the whiche woman mo¦che people haue opinion that this mone that is cal¦lid februarij where fore the secounde day of this mone is Candelmas day The Romaynes this nyghte wolde goo a bou¦te the Cite of rome with torchis and candels brē¦nyng in worshippe of this woman Februa for hope to haue the more helpe and socoure of her

Than was there a  that was callid Sergius & whan he sawe Cristen people drawe to this false mau¦mentry and vn we be¦leue he thought to vndo this foule vse and custu∣me and tourne hit in to goddis worshippe and oure ladyes and yaffe cō¦maundement that all cri¦sten people shulde come to churche and offer vp a candell brennyng in the worshippe that they did to this woman februa & did worshippe to oure lady and to her sone ou¦re lord Ihesu Criste so that now this feste is so∣lemply halowed thorow all cristendome and eche cristen man and womā of couenable age to co∣me to chirche and offer vp her cādels as though they were bodely with ou¦re lady hopyng for this reuerence and worshipp̄ that they do to oure la∣dy to haue a grete rewar¦de in heuen and of her sone oure lord ihesu▪ cri∣ste and so they may be sekyr and hit be doo in clene lyffe and with good deuocione.

Thus I may likyn oure lady to a p̄cious stone callid enix & he is as clere as any cri¦scall & shall of kinde whā the sonne shynythe hote on him hit openithe & re¦ceyued a droppe of the dewe of heuen in to him & closithe a yene till .ix. monthes aftyr & thanne hit openithe & fallithe ou¦te a stōe of the same kin¦de & so closithe a yene as euer hit was & neuer ope¦nithe aftyr. Thus oure lady was as clene as any cristall for the hote loue of the hooly goste at the ix. month is ende she was delyueryd of her sone oure lord ihesu criste & she aftyr as clene meyden as she was to fore Than whan the Angell hadde done his message he wen¦te his wey to heuē & ou∣re lady wente to her co∣syn elisabeth that was gre¦te with childe with seinte Iohan Baptiste & whō she come to Elisabethe she grette her mekely & as sone as oure lady spa∣ke to Elisabeth the chil∣de in Elisabethes wom¦be pleyde & made grete ioye for we that ou∣re lord had take man∣kynde & was come to sa∣ue he in that were lorne.

But whan ioseph sawe her gret with childe he meruyled gre¦tely how that myght be for well he wyste hit was not his fore he hadde ne∣uer parte of her body in that degre fore he knowe well that she had made a vowe before she wold ne¦uer haue parte of man∣nes body & thought how he was made to wedde her by the byddyng of the holy goste & grete mi¦racle shewyng & thou∣ghte right in his herte he was not worthy to dwel¦le in her company and thōght in his herte to ha¦ue gone home aʒene and to leue her there Thene come an angell to hym & sayd be not aferd to ta¦ke mari thy wyfe to thy kepyng fore it is of the holy goste that is quicke in her body for thow shall be her keper and norse to her chyld and whanne▪ hit is borne call it ihesus for he shall be sauiour to all the world.

Nowe haue
ye herde of the Annunci¦acion. There be somme people that aske a questi¦on why there stondithe a wyne potte with lyllyus betwene oure lady & Ga¦briell the Angell at her salutacion. This is the cause fore oure lady atte her salutacion conceyued be feythe Hit be fill thus vp¦on a cristemasse day that a cristen man and  iewe sate to gedyr and spake of the concepcion of o∣re lady and as they were there stode a wyne potte to fore he in with a lyly there ynne Thanne seyd the cristen man we be le¦ue that oure lady concey¦ued lyke as this lyly con¦ceyuythe colour of grene and aftyr bryngih forth a whyte floure with oute crafte of man or any pay ryng to the stalke right so oure lady conceyued of the hooly goste and af∣tyr broughte her sone ou¦re lord ihesu criste with¦oute any wemme of her body that is floure and chefe of all wymmen. Thanne seyde the iewe whan I see a lyly spryn¦ge oute of the dethe stal∣ke that stondith in this potte thanne wolle I be¦leue that thow seyste hit is trew and a none there with sprange a white ly∣ly oute of the dede stocke that stode in that same wyne potte And whan this Iewe sawe that a none he fill downe vn to the grounde vppon his knees and seyde thus. la¦dy nowe I see well that thowe conceyued with the hooly goste oure lor∣de Ihesu criste goddys sone of heuen And thou were clene mayden bothe be fore the birthe and al¦so aftyr the birthe And so a none he was cristo∣ned and so aftir he was a full hooly man. And this is the cause where so: that the potte with the lylyus is sette betwene
oure lady & the Angell for righte as the iewe di∣sputid with the cristen man of the maner of the concepcion So oure lady disputid with the An∣gell of the maner howe she shulde conceyue and be bothe modir and may¦de or she consentid ther to Thanne ye that woll faste the v. euys of ou¦re lady in worshippe of her v. ioyes that she had of her sone The firste was whan she conceyued of the holy goste & know that sche was modir to goddis sone of heuen. The secounde was on cristemasse day whan she was delyuered of her so ne with oute any payne of her body for as she cō¦ceyued with oute luste of her body also she was de¦lyuered withoute peyne of her body.

Furste for the temple ha¦lowyng for whan the ro∣maynes were lordes of all the worlde they made a temple in rome as a doffe house & namyd hit pan¦teon & set in the myddis of the temple an ymage that was the chefe maw∣ment of rome & of euery londe in the worlde an o∣thir ymage all a boute the walles & the name of the lōde that the jmage was of wreton vnder the fete of the jmage & all was made so by nigromancie yf that any lōde tourned from the emperour a nō the jmage of the londe wolde tourn his backe to the jmage of rome & his face to the walle So whā the bishopp̄ come to the temple & foūde any yma¦ge tourned a none they wolde to the Emperour & tell him.
