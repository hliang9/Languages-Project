OPen our eyes, O Lord, that wee may see the wonderous things of the Law: that by them as by a Glasse we may see our own weaknesse, and
by our weaknesse our wickedness, and by them both our accursedness: then cause thy sweet comforts and consola∣tions contained in thy Gospel, to shine into our Soules, by a true and lively faith in Christ Jesus: beseeching thee, that our dry and stony hearts may by the sweet Dews and Showers of thy Heavenly Spirit, be so moystned and softened, that as good ground they may ever be yeelding forth good fruit, to the glorifying of thy name, to the suppressing of sin, and increasing of Vertue, through Christ our Saviour. Amen.
