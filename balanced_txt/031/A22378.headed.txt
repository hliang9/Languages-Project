BY THE KING. A Proclamation for remouing the Receipt of his Maiesties Exchequer from Westminster to Richmond. THE Kings most Excellent Maiestie taking into his Princely consideâˆ£ration the great and dangerous increase of the Plague in and about the Citty of Westminster, where his Maiesties Receit of Exchequer hath beene hitherto kept, and willing as much as is possible to prevent the further danger, which might ensue as well to his owne Officers, which are necessarily to attend the same Receit, as to other his louing Subiects who shall haue occasion either for receit, or payment of monies to repaire thither: hath therefore taken order for the present remoue of the receit of his said Exchequer from thence to his Maiesties house at Richmond in the Countie of Surrey: and hath thought fit by this his Proclamation to publish the same, to the ende, that all persons whom the same may concerne, may take notice whither to repaire vpon all occasions concerning the bringing in, or issuing of his Maiesties Treasure at the receit of his Exchequer. Willing and requiring all Sheriffes, Bailiffes, Collectors, and all other officers, Accomptants, and persons whatsoeuer, who are to pay in any monies into the said receit of his Maiesties Exchequer, or otherwise to attend the same, to keepe their daies and times at Richmond aforesaid, and there to doe, pay, and performe in all things as they should, or ought to haue done at Westminster, if the said receit of Exchequer had continued there. And this to bee done and obserued vntill his Maiestie shall publish and declare his further pleasure to the contrary. Given at the Court at Ricot the one and thirtieth day of Iulie in the first yeare of his Maiesties Raigne of great Brittaine, France, and Ireland. God saue the King. Printed at Oxford by I. L. and W.T. for Bonham Norton and Iohn Bill, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. 1625.
