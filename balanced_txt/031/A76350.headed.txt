BEHOLD, THe summe of all the blood, treasures. Victories, and losses after these troubles, is to be bestowed on that most royall and precious Jewell, called, A Personall Treaty; And its no marvell; for the vertue there∣of is so rare and singular, that it is as well an excellent salve to cure all sores, as a soveraign remedy for all diseases, whether it be, The Kings Evill, or the Parliaments Evill, or the House of Lords evill, the Cities, or the Ar∣mies, or the Clergies, or the Cavaliers: so that only the peoples Evill▪ resteth to be cured, by the Scots glorious Reformation, according to their forced Covenant, which cometh to passe (they say) when neither Papists, nor Sepa∣ratists, nor Sectaties shall be any more mentioned. All these mighty States being thus so easily cured, and the people of their freedoms, Estates, and Livelihoods so pittifully cheated, it is like to follow in the next place, that not only the King, (whom they have conquered and imprisoned) being again to his Throne advanced, but all his race, will exer∣cise these 3. main points of Government, (without any more mention of a Parliament) which may be thus distinguished. The first is Vindicative; For by the scope of all his practices, as well be∣fore as since this Parliament, (tending alwayes to tyranny blood, and op∣pression) he and all his papists and Cavaliers. Prince Rupert, Maurice, Go∣ring, and the rest, will endeavour to be sully revenged on all whom either he or they know to be his or their enemies, begining at the Scots who first op∣posed him in his wicked practices, and next on the Parliament of England, and their adherents, for following their example, and last on the Army, by dozens and halfe dozens at Assises and Sessions, if he cannot do it speedily by another Army upon their refusing to disband, and not regarding to be pro∣claimed (as they were once declared) Rebels and Traytors. The second is Restaurative, because he and his Cavaliers will endeavour by force of Arms in City, and Troops of horses in Countrey, not onely to be re∣stored to their former greatnesse, but other his adherents (who were never great) to be advanced on the peoples ruines. And the third is Preservative, for he will make his little finger heavier then all the Parliaments loynes, by laying such heavy loads of taxations, sequestra∣tions, assesments, excises and other oppressions, that both nations and this wealthy City, shall be made so poore and miserable, that they shall never be able againe to rise in Armes against him or his forces, but rather to be weary of their lives, wive and families for want of subsistance. Thus in brief, ye have here a Warning of the bitter fruits of a personall treaty, though there were no wofull examples of France, Naples and other places, by such personall treaties, with their Kings, to terrify you from en∣gaging in such desperate designes, left ye be guilty of all the bloods that may
