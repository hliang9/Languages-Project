IGNORAMUS-Justice: OR, The ENGLISH-LAWS turn'd into a GIN, To let KNAVES Out, and keep HONEST MEN In. An Excellent New SONG. To the Tune of, Sir Egledemore. [1] DId you not hear of a Peer that was Try'd? With a fa, la, la, la, la. That looks like a Cask with a Tap in his side; With a fa, la, la, la, la. This Noble Peer to the Bar was call'd; The Witnesses swore, but the Fore-man out-baul'd; With a fa, la, la, la, la. [2] Then up Sir Samuel did start; Wit a fa, la, &c. And found the Bill not worth a F; With a fa, la, &c. With that the Court kept such a stir, The Fore-man shou'd prove so silly a Sir, With a fa la, &c. [3] The Witnesses for the King swore plain; With a fa, la, &c. But had they been so many again; With a fa la, &c. The Jury before such Truths receiv'd, Nor them, nor St. Peter they wou'd have believ'd; With a fa la, &c. [4] The Witnesses brought him a Traytor in; With a fa, la. But the Jury found it another thing; With a fa, la, &c. For he who did still his King oppose, Is made a True Subject in spight of the Laws; With a fa, la, &c. [5] Thus this Great Lord of High Renown; With a fa, la, &c. Th' Exalted Idol of the Town; With a fa, la, &c. Is clear'd by Ignoramus-sway, For Btraying the Church and the King in a day; With a fa, la, &c. [6] The Rabble to shew their Loyalty; With a fa, la, &c. Did in full shouts with the Jury agree; With a fa, la, &c. They Bonfires made, with great Applause, And all to maintain the Good Old Cause; With a fa, la, &c. [7] And now in spight of King and Queen; With a fa, la, &c. More Jollity was in the Streets to be seen; With a fa, la, &c. Thn on the Twenty Ninth of May. Though it was the Restauration-day; With a fa, la, &c. [8] Another passage I chanc'd to hear; With a fa, la, &c. That the Dr. is fallen from the Front to the Rear With a fa, la, &c. He to the Saints does now incline, Abjures the King, and with Rebels Combine; With a fa, la, &c. [9] Yet these pretend for to Inherit; With a fa, la, &c. (As Heirs do Estates) the Light of the Spirit; With a fa, la, &c. Yet let them say or do what they will, They'l find themselves Ignoramus still; With a fa, la, &c. [10] But had it been a Popish Lord; With a fa, la, &c. One Witness then had serv'd in a word; With a fa, la, &c. They had not then enquir'd so far; But found it, and never have stept from the Bar: With a fa, la, &c. [11] If by this Law the Charter be lost; With a fa, la, &c. Will Tony's Estate repay the Cost? With a fa, la, &c. The Boys will then find out the Cheat, And De Witt the old Canibal in his Retreat; With a fa, la, &c. [12] They'l Curse that Pate that studied to bring; With a fa, la, &c. Plague to the Countrey, and Ruine to th' King; With a fa, la, &c. Divested thus of 'Chitophel's Pride, They'l do him that Justice which Juries deny'd; With a fa, la, &c.
