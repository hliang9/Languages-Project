So that all the Cities and Countreys almost in England and Wales, have no Knights nor Citizens to represent them in Parliament, t the affairs of the three Kingdoms, are carried by the Burâˆ£gesses of a fevv inconsiderable Burroughs, vvho have excluded the rest of the Members of both Houses. They have also discharged the Parliament of Scotland, and the Parliament of Ireland, give Lavvs to impose Taxes on both, vvhich no English Parliament did in former times, nor they novv do by Lavv. By vvhich means, instead of three famous Parliaments of thse three renovvned Kingdomes, vve have nothing left, if the vvill and force of a fevv men may prevail, but a small piece of the Parliament of Engâˆ£land. Observations upon the afore mentioned List. 1. That in former times, and in the Primitive condition of this Parliament, upon the death or disâˆ£abling of any Member, the Keeper or Speaker gave his Warrant for a nevv Writ, that no place might vvant some to represent them. 2. Former Ages never knevv that vvay, or rather counted it dishonest, as vvell as unjust and illegal, for a fevv, and those not the chief of the House of Commons, to make use of a mercenary force of invaeal and Apostate Englishmen, to possesse themselves of the Legislative Povver, to the injurie of the vvhole Parliament, (vvhich should consist of above six hundred) and all the people. 3. The Major part of the House of Commons, vvhich are excluded by force, are so used, for over-voâˆ£ting the House from the minor part; Whereas till this Iron Age (though bin for dissenting in the House) never any that attended, vvere hindred from sitting, or excluded from free voting. 4. If those fevv vvho sit, had convenient modestie, they vvould not think the vvisdom of these three Kingdoms vvere under their Hoods, vvhen there are so many and vvise Personages in them nor Judge their own forcible exclusion by the Arm minions, vvhen so fevv, vvhen themselves by force seclude and eject so many.
