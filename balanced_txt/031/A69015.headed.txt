AN ENGLISH EXPOSITOR: TEACHING THE INTER¦pretation of the hardest words vsed in our Language. WITH SVNDRY EXPLICATIONS, Descriptions, and Discourses. By I. B. Doctor of Physicke. . LONDON Printed by IOHN LEGATT. 1621.
TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND VER∣TVOVS, HIS SINGVLAR GOOD LADIE, THE LADIE IANE Vicountesse Mountague, all honour and happinesse. BEing perswaded (Right Noble Lady) by some friends, for publike be∣nefit to make this colle∣ction of words common, which at first was inten∣ded only for priuate vse, (as written in my youth, at the request of a worthy Gentleman, one whose loue preuai∣led much with me) I could not find in heart to send it forth, no better furnished than with a bare Title; least like an vnknowne Infant, it should be exposed to ouer hard vsage, or per∣aduenture scornefully reiected, aduenturing abroad without countenance of any friend or commander. Vpon sure knowledge there∣fore
of your most honourable disposition, and former experience of your Ladyships fauour toward me, I am emboldned to pre∣sent this little Pamphlet vnto your honour, with hope that by your Patronage it shall not onely be protected from iniuries, but al∣so finde fauourable entertainment, and per∣haps gracefully admitted among greatest Ladies & studious Gentlewomen, to whose reading (I am made beleeue) it will not proue altogether vngratefull. And although I may well be taxed of folly or presumption, that for credit of a slender trislle, craue the assistance of so eminent a person, yet such (I confesse) is my care thereof (since I must not deny it for my owne) and my duty and de∣uotion so affected to your honour, and all yours; that I haue, (hoping of your Ladiships pardon) wilfully repelled all reasons which might disswade me, choosing herein not so much what may seeme most seemely, as what I suppose most behoouefull for me. Accept therefore I beseech your Honour, and receiue vnder your noble tuition this lit∣tle vocabulary Treatise, which hauing beene many years restrained of liberty, is now glad of enlargement, especially recommended vn∣to so worthy a Patronesse. The glorious Sun
loseth not the least point of his heighth by liberall lending downe his light, and quick∣ning with his influence the lowest creatures; neither is any eminency disgraced, that easi∣ly condescendeth to others desired good: which is also confirmed by the Poet, who saieth; Conspicitur nunquam meliore potentia causa, Quàm quoties vanas non sinit esse preces. Not thinking needfull therfore to trouble your Honour with many words of entreaty (vpon assured confidence of your wel known Charity and goodnesse) I conclude, sincere∣ly wishing to your Ladiship, the best that may be wished, and resting my selfe euer. Your Honours to be commanded, IO. BVLLOKAR.
To the Courteous Reader. HEre haue you (Gentle Reader) that which at first was not made for you, though now willingly (for your be∣nefite if you embrace it) offered to your kind acceptance. Commend it my selfe I will not, lest I should giue occasion to some quick heads, to come vpon me with the verse, Autor o∣pus laudat, &c. Yet this I will say (and say truely) that in my yonger yeares it hath cost mee some obseruation, reading, study, and charge; which you may easily beleeue, considering the great store of strange words, our speech doth borrow, not only from the Latine, and Greeke, (and some from the ancient Hebrew) but also from forraine vulgar Languages round about vs: beside sundry olde words now growne out of vse, and diuers termes of art, proper to the lear∣ned in Logicke, Philosophy, Law, Physicke, Astronomie, &c. yea, and Diuinitie it selfe, best knowen to the seuerall profes∣sors thereof. And herein I hope such learned will deeme no wrong offered to themselues or dishonour to Learning, in that I open the signification of such words, to the capacitie of the ignorant, whereby they may conceiue and vse them as well as those which haue bestowed long study in the languages; for considering it is familiar among best writers to vsurpe strange words, (and sometime necessary be reason ou speech is not sufficiently furnished with apt termes to expresse all
meanings) I suppose withall their desire is that they should also be vnderstood; which I (knowing that bonum quò communius eo melius) haue endeauoured by this Booke, though not exquisitely, yet (I trust) in some reasonable measure to performe. It is easier (all know) to find faults, then to mende them, and easier to mend faults in anothers worke already written, then to write any new worke free from all fault. If therefore any fault finder, or ouer curious Cri∣ticke (for from the best learned I expect best vsage) shall to shew his skill grow captious, and quarrell at my interpretati∣ons, I will desire him to forbeare bitternesse, and temper a while his choler, till hauing laide this worke aside, hee trauell himselfe in the same or some other new argument; and then I doubt not but he will either become more indifferent, or giue others occasion to bid him English the olde Prouerbe, Medice cura teipsum. But as for you (iudiciall or courteous Reader) whose fauour I desire, and whose counsell or friendly correcti∣on I will not refuse, if to you (I say) any thing herein shall occurre, which seemeth by me omitted, mistaken, or not fully satisfactory to your expectation, (for indeed there are almost slipt away seuen years since I had any leasure as much as to looke on it) I promise that vpon warning hereof giuen to me or the Printer, at a second Impression it shall be amended or supplyed. Meanewhile vse this as you finde it, and I perswade my selfe your honesty will say it is worth the money you paide for it. So committing my selfe and Booke to your fauo∣rable good liking, I commit you to God. From my house at Chicester in Sussex, this 17. day of October. 1616. Your hearty well-willer, Io: Bullokar.
An Instruction to the Reader. HAue care to search euery word ac∣cording to the true Orthography thereof, as for Phoenix in the Letter P. not in F. for Hypostaticall in Hy: not in Hi: Remember also that euery word mar∣ked with this marke * is an olde word, one∣ly vsed of some ancient writers, and now growne out of vse.

powder of the same sub∣stance that the stone is of. And this is a marke to know whether the stone bee fine and true: for the Indians doe counterfeite them sometimes and de∣ceiue many. This stone it taken out of the bow∣els of a beast in India, much like a Hart, sauing that his hornes are like a goates. The occasion of the growing of these stones (as some write) is thus. These Harts of wilde Goates (for they resem∣ble both) going to the dennes of Serpents in those countries, doe with their breathing compell them to come forth, and then eate them: after they goe whereas water is, and plunge themselues therein vntil they perceiue the furie of the venome be past, and till then they will not drinke a droppe: beeing come foorth of the water, they goe into the fields, where feeding vpon many healthfull hearbs (knowne to them by naturall instinct to bee of vertue against poyson) they are perfectly freed from all danger; and by the mixture of these herbs with the Serpents eaten before, these Bezar stones are very strangely (as is saide) ingendered within them: growing by little and little, as appeareth by the scales thereof one folded vpon an o∣ther.

Diuination A foretel∣ling of a thing before it happeneth: which may (as I take it) bee diui∣ded into three different kindes; namely, super∣naturall, naturll, and su∣perstitious Diuination. Supernaturall Diuination
(onely reuealed to man by God,) is not properly called Diuination, but prophecy, with which all the holy Prophets haue in former times beene inspi∣red. Naturall Diuination may bee diuided into two branches; whereof the first is, that which hath in former times been pra∣ctised by wicked spirits in oracles and answers giuen by them in Idols, and is at this day sometime seene in possessed persons, who by suggestion of the diuell may foretell often things to come: and this is but a naturall Diuination: For although to vs it seeme miraculous, because of our ignorance in the causes and course of things, yet in those spirits, it is but natu∣rall, who by their long ex∣perience, and great obser∣uation, besides the know∣ledge of secrets in nature, and their quicke intelligence from all places, are able to foresee much more then wee by nature can. The second branch of na∣turall Diuination, is that which a wise man may foretell by probable con∣iecture, beeing no way of∣fensiue, so long as it is on∣ly guided by reason, and ouerruled by submitting it selfe to the almightie power of GOD. And to this second kinde of Diuination, may also A∣strologie bee referred (which by the motion and influence of Starres and Planets doth pro∣mise to foretell many things) so long as it kee∣peth it selfe in due limits, and arrogateth not too much to the certainetie thereof: into which ex∣cesse of vanity if it should breake foorth, it can then bee no longer called na∣turall Diuination, but superstitious and wicked: for the Starres may in∣cline but not impose a necessitie in particular things. The third and last manner of Diuinati∣on, is that which we cal∣led superstitious, whereof there hath among the Gentiles beene diuers dif∣ferent kinds, namely. Au∣guration,
Aruspicie, Necro∣mancie, Gromancie, Hydro∣mancie, Pyromancie, Cossi∣nomancie, Palmistrie or Chi∣romancie. Augutation, was a diui∣nation made of things to come, by the slying, fee∣ding, & chirping of birds: the professors wherof cal∣led Augurs, were of great account among the heathē Romans, in so much that there was a Colledge of them in the citie; neither would the Romans vnder∣take any publike matter of importance, without as∣king their assent. But the vanity hereof was well de∣rided by a wise Iew, named Mossolamus; as Iosephus writes. For an Augur in the wars once requiring, that the army which was then marching, might stand still a while, till he tooke obser∣uation of a bird thereby, to foreknow the successe of that expedition, this Iew whilst the Augur was bu∣sie in his art, shot at the Bird with an arrow, and by chance killed her: whereat the Augur and others being highly offen∣ded: Are you so foolish (quoth the Iew) to ima∣gine, this poore Bird can tell what will happen to vs, that could not foresee her owne death so neere at hand? Aruspicie, is a diuination, which by ope∣ning and viewing the bow∣els of beasts, did vnder∣take to foretell things to come: the professors whereof were called A∣ruspices. Necromancie, the worst of all others, is that diuination, which is practised by coniuration, and calling vp Diuels or dead mens ghosts. Which manner of diuination we reade practised by King Saul (1. Reg. cap. 28.) when he required a Sor∣ceresse to call vp the spirit of Samuell to him. Geo∣mancie, is a kinde of diui∣nation practised by ma∣king prickes and lines in the earth; as the name in Greeke signifieth. So Hy∣dromancie, is a diuination made by some apparition in water, as Varro writeth that a Boy saw inwater,
one bearing the forme of Mercurie, who foretold in one hundred and fiftie verses, the euent of the warre which the Ro∣mans had with King Mithridates. Pyromancie is a diuination made by the fire, or spirits ap∣pearing in the fire. Cos∣cinomancie is a ridiculous kinde of diuination made with a sieue; which at this day is vsed by some sim∣ple women, and appea∣reth to bee of antiquitie, for in the third Idylle of Throcritus there is men∣tion made hereof. Palmistrie or Chiromancie, is a diuination practised, by looking vpon the lines of the fingers and hands, an art still in vse, among fortune tellers, Egypti∣ans, and iuglers. Besides these there were also o∣ther diuinations, as name∣ly Aeromancie, that which is gathered by apparitions in the aire. Capnomancie, by the flying of smoake. Catoptromancie by visions shewne in a glasse. All which being euen by the Pagans themselues ac∣counted deceitfull and vain, it remaineth that of Christians they be vtterly reiected and abhorred. Diuorce. A separation of man and wife, which was (as our Sauiour witnes∣seth) first permitted by Moses vnto the Israelites, for the hardnesse of their hearts, that men might rather put their wiues a∣way, whome they grew wearie of, then vse them with too great extremitie, to shorten their liues, as many did. The woman so diuorced was to haue of her husband, a writing (as Iosephus witnesseth to this effect. I promise, that here∣after, I will lay no claime to thee: And this writing was called a bil of diuorce. But with Christians this custome is abrogated, sa∣uing onely in case of a∣dulterie. The auncient Romanes also had a cu∣stome of diuorce, and a∣mongst them, it was as lawfull for the wiues to put away their husbands, as for the husband to dis∣misse
his wife: but amongst the Israelites, this prero∣gatiue was onely permit∣ted to the husband. Diureticall. That which is of vertue, to cause one to make water. Diumall.

For if they amount to aboue 30. then must you cast away the 30 and the remaining num∣ber shall be the Epact. As for example, in this yeare 1616. the Epact is 22. to which if you adde eleuen for the next yeares Epact, it maketh 33. from which if you take away 30. there will remaine three; which is the Epact for the next yeare 1617.

Betweene these two motions, are said to bee two stations; namely when a Planet ceaseth going forward, and beginneth to be retro∣grade, or comming to the farthest point of his retro∣gradation, goeth forward againe: so that in the Epi∣cycle, these Planets wheele about somtime according,
sometime contrary to the order of the signes. Epicure. It is commonly taken with vs, for a man giuen ouer much to plea∣sure, especially in gluttony.
