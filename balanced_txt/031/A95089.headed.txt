THE TRUE NARRATIVE OF THE CONFESSION AND EXECUTION of Elizabeth Hare which is burnt for High-Treason, IN Bun-Hill FIELDS On Tuesday the 30th. of this Instant October. 1683 But Sydley Vanderlyn had his Majesties most Gracious Reprieve. ON Tuesday the 30th. of this Instant October, Elizabeth Hare, Condemned lately at the Old Barly, and received Sentence to be burnt alive, and it being left to the Discretion of the Sheriff of Middlesex, to appoint a fit place for the Execution: Bun-Hill Fields was accord∣ingly appointed: she was brought under a strong Guard of Middlesex Officers Commanded by Mr. Rouse the present under Sheriff, accompa∣nied by great Numbers of Men on Horseback; the
Fields being crouded to behold the direful Exit. About eleven a Clock she arrived at the Stake, where was prepared a convenient quantity of Ba∣vins, Reeds, and Fagots, and as expected, she made a clear Confession of all the publick offen∣ces she had been guilty of such as relate to her present end, and many more of the same nature: and that one part of her life she lived about Bun Hill Fields where she had a Bastard Child, and although she had forborn Confessing thereof till this time that she was wholly Convinced she must now die, at that time she was so void of Remorse, to the young Infant that she buried it a live in Bun hill Fields, and at this last Instant of time, she could no longer forbear revealing the same, it being so great a Terror to her Consci∣ence; These Words being directed to a Learn∣ed Divine Which did there officiate most earnestly, desiring his prayers and the prayers of all good Christians. A Halter was fixed at the uper end of the Stake to the Neck of the Suffer∣er, who was placed on| a Block which the Executioner removed at convenient time, which prevented her from making any Skreecks or out∣rages by reason of any pain she might receive from the Fire; in which manner she was consumed to ashes, which sad Spactacle may be sufficien tto warn all who have the least all Remnant of good in them, to be watchful & at times so carefull, that when any vain tempta∣tions of worldly Riches, or any seeming Vanities
thereof shall in the least measure incline their purposes, that they apply themselves to all∣mighty God in prayer, to enable them to with. stand all such, Devilish inclinations, that lead to no other end then the Gates of Death and Destru∣ction in this world, besides the great danger there is of eternal Destruction in the World to come. For it is daily experienced, that such practices do seldom pass unattended with all manner of ickedness and Debauchery that it may be possi∣ble for Humanity to be capable or Guilty of; being naturally attendant for Men not to shrink at any wickedness if once they trample upon any part of the Fence that preserves the Common Rule of Moral Justness, that being the Grand step that is made to the Destruction of all the Religious du∣ties accompanied with all Atheistical and Fanati∣cal Principles as tend to nothing but the Total Rooting up of all Order and Good Government, that the providence of almighty god has been please to establish amongst us, not only for our present Comfort and Well being in this present Life. but with the assistance of Divine Grace, may enable all that truly fear God, and work Righte∣ousness to receive those blessings laid up for the Faithful to all Eternity, and all persons whether young or old, that have been tempted by any of the Emissaries of such wicked and dangerous pro∣jects let them cease from any such evil practices for the future, and praise God for his Providence, in preserving them this time from the jaws of Death, that every hour is ready to seize them
and give them a time of amendment of Life in this World, and that God in his great Mercy for the Future, would prevent & give such that have been any ways Concerned in that Course of Life (that caused this Dreadful history) a true sorrow & amendment of Life.
