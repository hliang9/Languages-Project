The Distracted Young-MANS Answer TO The Injured Maiden. Shewing the Cruelty of his Parents, in forcing him to marry anoâˆ£ther, because she had a better Fortune, which proved the Ruine of the young Man and his former Mistress. Te the same Tune: or, The Languishing Swain. IT's true, thou justly maist complain, On thy unfaithful perjur'd Swain, But yet at first I did design, To marry you, to marry you, In little time. I found you beautiful and fair, Delightful with a pleasing air; Endow'd with all the charms of love, And I believ'd, and I believ'd, You'd constant prove. My father told me o're and o're, Of one who riches had great store; He said, If I did not agree, To court that lass, to court that lass, He'd own not me. I went as he did give command, Altho' you had my heart and hand; The God above do know it's true, I always meant, I always meant; To marry you. Our Parents straightways did agree, And said, That I must married be; To her they lately wish'd me to. Then I reply'd, then I reply'd; What shall I do? My father said, To Church now go, A thousand pound this has I know; For her you courted just before, She has not half, she has not half; So much in store. I answer'd yea, she has my heart, Besides me vow'd never to part; Therefore dear father, do not make Me break this vow, me break this vow; Which I did take. He said, If I a thousand took, I should no more upon her look; But straight he made me for to go To Church and wed, to Church and wed, I know not who. Altho' I have a rich young wife, I have no comfort of my life; For she that had my heart before, Will keep the same, will keep the same, For evermore. I do implore the God above, To look upon my injur'd love, Who justly does complain on me, And help her in, and help her in Her misery. Then young men all a warning take, Ne'er break those vows in love you make If she you love does prove but kind, Be not like me, be not like me; To change your mind. Since I have proved thus untrue; I bid unto the world adieu, For I no comfort now can have; Then death come send, then death come send, Me to my grave. LONDON: Printed for P. Pelcomb, in Fleet-street.
