FUIMUS The Right Honble. Charles Viscount Bruce of Ampthill (en . Heir Apparent of Thomas Earl of bury) & Baron Bruce of Whorleton
To His most SERENE HIGHNESS, RICHARD, Lord PROTECTOR OF THE Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Do∣minions and Territories thereunto belonging. May it please Your Highness, AS nothing can be presented to the Poten∣tates of the World of greater value, then the Labours of Famous Historio∣graphers, who describe to the life the Examples of such Eminent Personages as were transcendent in preceding Ages; and may in their
Successours beget both Emulation and Experi∣ence: so shall I not need to apprehend that this History (which in all humility I present unto Your Highness) will prove unacceptable, since therein You may encounter with such a Model of all kinde of Vertues and Perfections, as I hope may take a deeper impression in Your Highnesses Breast, in regard that it will be found, that Art herein is seconded by Nature. And whereas I am under the lash of a severe Castigation for my presumption, in profering this History to Your Review, as I acknowledge, when I seriously consi∣der how You have attracted to Your Self that lively Pourtraiture of his Great Soul, that You appear the true Embleme both of his Vertues and Majesty. May it please Your most Serene Highness, I cannot chuse but address this present Oblation as to Your Self, so in other Languages, to the rest of the Princes and Potentates of the Earth, I bequeath it unto posterity, very humbly craving the favourable Protection of Your Highnesses Pa∣tronage. Nor durst I publish so glorious a Work to the World, before I had craved Your Highnesses pardon for my Rashness, in adventuring to trace those Vigorous Lineaments in the Alexander, whom Your Highness so well resembleth, and in whom your Highness beareth so great a part. Moreover, as a sole Apelles could onely be ca∣pable of so great an Enterprize, so it will be alto∣gether unnecessary for me to endeavour the De∣scription of that Pourtraiture, which so evi∣dently
is manifested to all the World, both in Your Highnesses Person and Actions: Wherefore, my Lord, I must needs confess, that Your Highness is the true Original, and mine onely relating to the Out-side of so Great and unalterable an Albionist. The truth is, I finde not in my self ability to ex∣press the Real Worth of His Accomplishments, and Hardy Features, accompanied with that Vi∣vacity and Lustre, which secret Mystery lyeth onely in the Hand of that great Master of Nature, and Extant in that very Personage, whose Si∣mile is hardly this Day to be found in the whole Ʋniverse, except in Your Inimitable Self. Nor doth Art or Humane frailty allow so much to be in the Possession of the best men. Therefore those who go about to Pourtraict such like Incomparable Personages, cannot avoid one of those extremities, which Painters run into when they go about to represent the Sun; who either place themselves at so great a distance, as that they can onely discover an ineffications and feeble Reflections of its Beams; or approach so neer unto it, as that being dazled with its Resplendency, and overcome with its Heat, they are bereaved of their Senses, and retain onely their Hearts at liberty to adore and admire that powerful Hand, which formed so glorious a Creature. To the like Non plus am I reduced, who rashly ascend to the very summit of the Throne of Honour, thence to contemplate his late Highness Person, surrounded by so glo∣rious a Resplendency as no eyes are able to behold, nor to be comprehended by the mindes of men; so
that I must needs sink under the burthen, and content my self with the Poets Expression, —Inopem me copia fecit. In which extasie all my Senses being surprized, my Heart is onely left free to admire, and my Tongue to plead Excuses, and offer up good Wishes, which I most humbly Dedicate and Devote unto Your most Serene Highness. Nor could the Heavens have ever established a more fitting Per∣sonage, to bear a share in, or inclination unto this Work, then Your Highness, as well as to defend it from Envy it self. And if so be History be a second Life, Your Highness may judge by the black Attempts which threatned Your Glorious Father, how this Work will be assailed; and how many Enemies its Authour must resolve to en∣ter into the Lists withall: their Rage being thereby renewed and augmented, by their percei∣ving that the Tomb hath onely bereaved us of the least part of this Great Heroe. And how malicious soever their Envy may appear in such Stories which possibly may be written in Contra∣diction hereof; it will onely publish from Truth it self, to the World, their inveterate Spleen, which can never pierce through the bright Rayes of his Innocent and Glorious Actions. Moreover, whereas the Divine Providence hath so often and miraculously preserved the first life of his late Highness, against the Attempts both of men and monsters; Your most Serene High∣ness is also engaged, as well by Imitation, as by the Interest of Your Care and Royal Dignity,
to watch over the Preservation of his second Life, which is in Your Highness by so Lawful a Succession, as is devolved upon Your Self. The Glorious Course whereof I resolve to trace from this very moment; that I may the better publish the Illustrious Transactions thereof in five other Languages, which during my Travels I have acquired. In which also I intend to publish this present History, the French being already per∣fected and fit for the Press: His great Soul ex∣pecting proportionable Honours to its Dignity; and his vaste Minde requiring number less Ele∣gies, which may remain as so many living Monu∣ments, not to be defaced by Times Violence nor Envy. But I press this Subject too home to Your Highness, since You bear so great a share there∣in, and my self dare attribute so little of it to my own incapacity, of compassing so great an undertaking. Wherefore, I shall onely hereby endeavour to attract others, and to shew them the Borders and Coast of that vaste Sea into which they ought to lanch: so that like to a Forelorn Hope, I shall onely first mount the Breach, and by di∣verse Languages animate all the Trumpets of Fame, to Celebrate the Glory of his late High∣ness, in those parts of the World, where I have conversed for the space of sixteen or eighteen years past. Hoping for the future to write the Heroick Actions of this Nation in unexpugna∣ble Characters, to leave unto Posterity (as an eye witness) the Rehearsal of those Victories
which Heaven shall bestow on England, under Your Glorious Government; that so I may the better satisfie my Zeal and Fidelity to Your Highness, and approve my self to be Your Highnesses most Humble, most Obedient, most Faithful Servant, and Loyal Subject. S. Carrington.
The Preface. Courteous Reader, THat which I do here intend to present you with all, is, the Life and Death of Oliver Cromwel, late Lord Protector of the Common-wealth of England; that Grand Perso∣nage, whose Conduct and Fortune all the world doth admire; and who in the space of ten years time, did accomplish the work of a whole Age: nay more, he perfected the work of future Ages; ha∣ving settled England on such good Foun∣dations, that if she continues to build thereon, she may expect to produce se∣cond Edwards, and second Henries. This Illustrious Personages life is pre∣sented unto you in three several Scenes; First, you will finde him Dormant, like unto David midst his Flocks, untill the Troubles of his Countrey awake him.
And that the Almighty was pleased to call upon him to appease them, as well as to en crease his glory, you may reflect up∣on the course and progress of his valour; by which being elevated almost to the sublimest pitch of his Grandeur, he was left to act more absolutely according to his own prudence, and was enforced to lay hands on the Reins of the most confused State that ever was. Where you will finde his late High∣ness demeaning himself like unto a well resolved skillful Pilot in a Vessel tossed and tumbled by a tempest, bestirring himself amidst the contrariest of Winds, and wisely and dexterously avoiding those Rocks, Shelves, and Quicksands, which threatned England with a second Shipwrack. This his sage conduct being the more to be admired, in that as then he had but a limited Power, although the whole was due to his dexterity and prudence; yet each one thought they had as great a share as himself in the So∣vereign Power, which as they supposed they had acquired by the Pen or the Sword; either in the Army or in the Parliament: so that all this great Poli∣tician
could as then do, was to recon∣cile those several Opinions then in agi∣tation, and to suffer himself to be swayed by the current of those windes and streams which he was neither willing nor well able to withstand at that time. Now as there is nothing more danger∣ous in States then great and sudden changes, so nothing more difficult to be managed; and this being the Master∣piece which a Politician hath to act, this ensuing History will discover unto us the chief and several Motions, Turnings, Windings, and Settling of the same. His late Highness like unto an expert Physician, was first put to read the Tem∣perment of England, her former way and manner of actings, before the Cur∣rent of her Humors, and the Symptomes of all the Evils and Malignities which threatned her. He likewise reflected on the Body Politick, which he found as well as the Humane had its Replenish∣ments, and Evacuations, and Crisis; and then observed that as well in the one as the other, those sudedn changes which happen are either Destructive or Saluta∣ry. He observed that these Bodies nou∣rished
Choller as well as other Humors; and thence deemed War to be the best Rubarb to purge them, least otherwise they might evacuate of themselves. Moreover, he observed these Humors were subject to grow sharp and to rebell, and that they oftentimes caused such vio∣lent and hot fits, as that without the as∣sistance of an expert and accomplished Physician, death was like to ensue; or which is worst, most violent languish∣ing and intollerable diseases. So that the thing which is most to be admired at in the conduct of this grand Politician, is, that he could governe a People, and pro∣cure a perfect Union and Tranquillity amidst three Nations, whose mindes were agitated by several Opinions, and whereby they are continually stirred against each other; no motion trans∣porting men more impetuously towards civil Dissentions, then those which arise from the several Professions in Religion. For besides the chief Religions profest in these three Nations, viz. that of Geneva, the Protestant, the Episcopal, and some Roman Catholicks, there are sprung up throughout all England, an infinite num∣ber
of other Sectaries, which like unto so many Hidra's, did seem to issue forth from each others neck; and whereby the mindes of men were so discomposed and hurried away into such violent Enthusi∣asmes, as they stood in need of a good Guide to conduct and refrain them from a total precipitation. And as it would be a difficult task to give you the several Denominations, Derivations, and Off∣springs of all these several Schismaticks, I shall therefore pass them by as being numberless. Wherefore, if we acknowledge as it is most assuredly true, that Religion is the chief principal part which doth most of all contribute to the well ordering, qui∣et, and peaceable settling and Governing of a People; we may easily judge that his late Highness the Lord Protector stood in need of more then ordina∣ry Sagacity, Prudence, and Conduct, to procure that Tranquillity, Plenty, and Splendour to England, wherein he left it; and the which without example, is hardly to be found in all the other parts of Europe. But to come nearer home, to my own
enterprize, the Life of an Historian is the Life of History; and his truth the most proper Preface to it. Thus much I can safely write for my self, that I have en∣tertained no design beyond Truth; as I have not made this History subservient either to Flattery or Interest: I question not but the prejudice of some may go about to detect, but I am so confident of my own integrity, as to believe, no per∣son can forme a truer Relation of the late disturbed Affairs of these Nations. I ac∣knowledge where Originals have failed me, and must do others, I have conform∣ed to Copies, but of so near extraction, as that they are but once removed from their Fountain. I being so truly acquainted, my know∣ledge so strongly established to trace this History, as to discerne how to write; so also for the credit of my laborious In∣dustry, I can affirme, That my Infor∣mation was not without near approaches, as I continually conversed with the most principal Instruments in these admirable Transactions, persons Unbiased, that had certain and full Intelligence of the highest emergences, whether Forreign or
Domestick. If I have been but as judi∣cious and clear-sighted to perceive and write, as I have been honestly unconcer∣ned to transmit this History to posteri∣ty, I shall not need to fear but stand se∣cure against the most malicious, or other∣wise impertinent Imputations. Having thus discharged my Conscience in these my honest endeavours, I have no more to write, but to bid thee read, and then cen∣sure Impartially. Farewell. Thine, S. C. The Postscript. REader, Be pleased to take notice that this History is Translating into five other Languages; it is in French ready for the Press: the other Transla∣tions for other parts of the World being in such forwardness, as that they will be speedily extant.
An Advertisement. Courteous Reader, BE pleased to take notice, that in the Page 195. seven lines before that never till now published, an Incomparable Poem of the Eng∣lish Virgil of our times, Mr. Edmund Waller, on General Mountague's wonderful Victory at Sea over the Spaniards, at Sancta Cruze, that in the Printing this escaped, for shaming read sub∣lime: for other lesser Mistakes, the expedition of the Press may obtain thy excuse.
THE HISTORY Of his Highness OLIVER, The late Lord-Protector, From his Cradle to his Tomb. The Introduction. IF those Writers who pen the Histo∣ries of great Men, had the same advantage as Painters have, who oblige those whom they are to Portraict, to seat themselves in such a posture, as they may best consider and judge of them, who do choose their Lights, and thereby discover most apparently the most de∣licate
and neatest feature of the Faces, which they are to represent; I might hope to give unto the publick and to Posterity a perfect Re∣semblance of his late Highness the Lord Prote∣ctor of England, although I should meet with a great deal of difficulty in the well applying of the Colours, and to make choice of such exqui∣sire Ones to trace the Footsteps of so glorious a Life. True it is, that the Soul is not visible, as Mens Bodies are; for as it hath its Origine from Heaven, we must of necessity ascend up thither, and enter into the Councels of the Al∣mighty, to observe those Lights and Inspirati∣ons which he gives unto those persons whom his Divine Providence doth make choice of to command here on Earth, and those designs which he doth frame in these great Souls, for the encrease of his Glory, and for our Peace and Tranquillity. So that our Ignorance doth ob∣lige us herein to immitare the modesty and good behaviour of Painters, who instead of a beautifull nakedness, render it to our view wrapt up in fine Linnen, and not discovering unto us the Brain, whence the severall motions of the Body do proceed, they only set before our eyes a dumb Image without Motion, and some few Physionomical Marks, which do help us to guess who the party is they intend to represent unto us. My intent is, to give you a rough Draught of this most excellent Personage, whose Actions are so glorious and surpassingly winning in themselves, as that we shall only need to enter
upon a Relation of them, and so insensibly com∣pleat a Naturall Panegyrick, much like unto those exquisite Beauties, the advantages where∣of we so much the more lessen, and detract from, by how much the more we go about to embel∣lish them with Ornaments and Cloathing; so that the Resplendency of my Subject it self will spare me the labour of making a long In∣troduction, and the vastness of its Renown saves me the care I ought to have taken in duly prepa∣ring the Readers Mind to conceive worthily of this my HEROE, and to have begot in them a Love and Esteem of his Person. His late Highness was born in the Town of Huntington, the chief of the Shire, which bear∣eth the same Name, of a Noble Parentage, be∣ing descended from the Ancient and Illustrious Family of the Williams's, of the County of Glamorgan, which Name in the Reign of King Henry the Eighth, was changed into that of Cromwell, as will appear by the ensuing History. His High∣ness Birth and Paren∣tage. His Parents left him not much Wealth, but cau∣sed him to be educated in the University of Cambridge; where, as it is reported, a publick Representation being to be performed, he that was to represent the Kings part, falling sick, this our Cromwell was said to have taken the Part upon Himself, and so well imployed the little time he had to get it by Heart, Lingua the Combate of the Sences.as it seemed, that it was Infused into him, and whereby he repre∣sented a King with so much Grace and Majesty, as if that Estate had been naturall unto him: And truly thus much may be averred, that his
Soul comprehended all those Seeds and Foun∣dations of such Vertues, as do usually render a Person capable to govern others. His excel∣lent quali∣fications.Having finished his course of Study at the U∣niversity, when he had perfectly acquired unto himself the Latine Tongue (which Language, as all men know, he made use of to treat with Strangers) his Parents designed him to the Study of the Civill Law, which is the Founda∣tion of the Politicks: It being very requisite that he who was Ordained to give Law to three Kingdomes, and to the whole Sea besides, should have a smack of the Law, and chiefly of those which were the most Essentiall and Uni∣versall, for he dived not over deep into this Study, but rather chose to run a Course in all the rest of the Sciences, and chiefly in the Ma∣thematicks, wherein he excelled, as likewise he may be justly said to have yeilded to no Gen∣tleman whatsoever in the knowledge of the rest of the Arts and Sciences. But to keep more close to our History. His Fortune and Rise did commence by those very means which by degrees elevated him to the Supream pitch of Grandeur; The conjun∣cture of Affairs brought him on the Stage, his Valour raised him up, and the Politick part ta∣king the upper hand as belonging to Her by Birth-right, Crowned him with all those Blisses which both the former and latter could justly discern. Wherefore the Disorders of England and Scotland being not possible to be appeased with∣out
the intervening of a Parliament, there was one summoned in the year 1641. in which the late Protector assisted in the quality of a Bur∣gess, for the Town of Cambridge, one of the most famous Universities of England, who could not fail in making so good a Choice, and so worthy of such Eminent persons as them∣selves, verst in all Sciences and Profound Know∣ledge. Things growing past an amicable recon∣ciliation between the King and the Parliament, after severall and infinite Treaties and Propo∣salls; the last Reason both of the one and the other terminated in the loud Volleys of Ca∣nons, each Partie took the Field, The first Engage∣ment.and those Parliament Men who were minded to engage in the War, did with a generall consent and ap∣probation obtain leave to suspend their Im∣ployment in the House whereunto they were called, To maintain the Liberties of Parlia∣ment with the points of their Swords; His late Highness was none of the last that profer∣red his Service to the Parliament, and the bet∣ter to witness his Passion and Zeal to the Cause, he raised a Troop of Horse at his own costs and Charges. The esteem he had in the House, and the value which the County of Essex put upon his Person, obliged the Parliament to grant him a Commission to levy as many men as he could, that so he might make up a compleat Regiment: And as he was Burgess of the Town of Cambridge, so his first care was to set∣tle that place for the Parliament, although he met with great Obstacles therein, and the Rea∣son
likewise was very harsh; it being the Month of January, the very heart of the Winter: Now you are to note, that the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were the first of all the Towns in England which declared themselves for the King, and the last which acknowledged the new established Authority; by reason they were fil∣led with persons designed to possess those Church Goods which were in the Kings Dona∣tion, besides which the Parliament detesting their Commissions, was resolved to reduce and reform them. The Trea∣sure of the Uni∣versity sailed on.His late Highness having notice that all the Colledges were making a Stock and Assembly of all their Plate, and of what ready monies they had, to send it unto the King, all which a∣mounted unto a very considerabe Sum, went sud∣denly to Cambridge, and seized all that Treasure just as it was ready to be sent away unto Oxford: And as he was upon this Expedition, he signal∣lized himself far more by another Action; Sir Thomas Comes who was newly made Sheriff of Hertford Shire, had received Orders from the King, to publish a Proclamation, by which the County of Kent, and all its Adherents were pro∣claimed Traytors. His late Highness. surprised him in the very Action on a Market-day, in the Town of St. Albons, and having seized the said Knight, he sent him up to the Parliament. And not long afterwards he very oportunely assembled all the Forces of the County of Cambridge, & exhorted the Neighbouring Coun∣ties of Suffolk, Norfolk, and Essex, to send him
their Aydes to oppose the Lord Capell, who was to have been seconded by Prince Rupert, and should have seized Cambridge, and thereby have impeded the association of the united Coun∣ties about London, which were the only Bulwark and Defence of that great City, wherein the Sinews of War did consist, and by whose resolu∣tions and proceedings the rest of the Kingdome was then governed; His Highness diligence and vigilancy at that time, brake the Neck of that Design, and forced the Lord Capell, and Prince Rupert to direct their Thoughts another way. In the beginning of the Month of March, next ensuing, his late Highness having complea∣ted a Regiment of Horse to the full number of a thousand Men, marched with great diligence in∣to the County of Suffolk, on the advice which he had received of a great Confederacy which was there hatching between the Nobility of the Kings Party who were assembled in a consi∣derable Town, called Lowerstost; whom he so unsuspectedly surprised, as that he became Ma∣ster of the place without the fiering of one Gun; He took Prisoners Sir Thomas Barker, Sir John Pettas his Brother, Mr. Knevet, Catlines Ham∣mond, Cory Turrill, Preston, and above twenty other Persons of Note. He likewise there took severall parcels of Armes and Ammunition, and other War-like Equipages, sufficient to have ar∣med a considerable Party, and had not his High∣ness made use of his accustomed Prudence, and his usuall Activity in this Conjuncture, he had met with a great deal of difficulty on this ac∣count,
and the whole County had run a danger to have been lost: severall persons of Quality, and divers Noble men hourly flocking to that Ran∣dezvous; This Service was most seasonably rendred to the Parliament, and the Kings Party both in Suffolk and Norfolk, were thereby to∣tally disheartned and dincouraged. The Spring being advanced, and the Season permitting the framing of greater Designs, and taking of longer Marches, his Highness having well setled the Peace and Tranquillity of the as∣sociated Counties; which (as we have sayd) ser∣ved as a Bulwark to the Parliament, his Mind and his Valour requiring a space of Ground as vast as its Activity, he raised a Body of an Army and that a very considerable one, being compo∣sed of such zealous persons as had already been charmed with his Conduct, and being attracted by his Reputation, did voluntarily come in un∣to him to serve with, and under him in the Cause of Religion; He thus Marched into Lin∣colnshire, with a Resolution to assist those Forces which lay about Newark, one of the strongest places which held out as then for the King, into which the greatest part of the Gentry of Lin∣colnshire had retired themselves, and where there was a good Garison commanded by Officers, who had served their Apprentiships in the Mili∣tary Art beyond the Seas; so that they fetcht in vast Contributions out of the Neighbouring Counties, and made Inroads to the very Gates of Lincoln: And his Highness being now at the Head of a Regiment of Horse, in his passage
through Huntingtonshire, was willing to deliver his Native Country from those Disorders which two contrary Parties do usually cause and com∣mit being in one Shire, he therefore disarmed all those who were not affectioned to the Parlia∣ment, by which means he so enlarged and aug∣mented his Troops that he had gotten two thousand Men together; and before he came neer Newark, he received another re inforce∣ment of Horse, which was sent him by Captain Hotham, as also some other Troops which were sent him from Lincoln: insomuch that he thus framed a sufficient considerable Body of an Ar∣my for that time: A remark∣able expe∣dition.He no sooner was come nigh to Newark, but that he signallized himself by an Action which was the more glorious, by how much the less it was expected nor foreseen; Captain Wray having so inconsideratly placed himself with his Lincolne Horse too nigh Newark, was in the Night set upon by the Gar∣rison, which made a great Sally, and surrounded and took all his Men; the Alarm comming hot to his late Highness Quarters, he forthwith re∣paired to the place where the Fight was, it be∣ing then about ten of the Clock in the Night, relieved the said Captain Wray, and took three whole Companies of the Enemy, killed the rest on the place, and made good his Retreat by Fa∣vour of the dark Night. After which, having blocked up the place, he received those Sallies which were made by the Besieged, with so much Courage and Vigilancy, as that he alwaies came off with advantage,
sometimes forcing the Enemies into their very Works, and sometimes cutting them in pieces, insomuch that he never returned unto the Camp but he was laden either with Prisoners, Spoyles or Colours, and that he might neglect no oc∣casion for to give a testimony of his Prudence and Activity, he also scouted abroad into the Country with his Horse, and neer unto Grantham he defeated a strong Party which came forth of Newark, with a handful of Men, onely since which, the World did take notice that there was somewhat more then ordinary in the person of his late Highness: And not long after he also defeated part of the Lord of New∣castles Army, which came to relieve Newark, setting upon them in their Quarters betwixt Grantham and Newark, where he took one hundred Horses, forty Prisoners, and killed se∣verall on the place. And should I particular∣lize all his late Highness's memorable Actions, during these English Civill Wars, I must of ne∣cessity compile a whole Volume thereof, since nothing worth the taking notice of ever hapned in which he was not a Sharer, and wherein he was not alwaies one of the foremost: wherfore I shall only insist upon two chief Actions which were of so great Importance, that the decision of the whole War depended thereon, and wher∣in the Valour of his late Highness may justly claim the greatest, if not the sole share. Two of the Parliaments Armies, the one commanded by the Lord Fairfax, and the other by the Lord Manchester, being united to the Scotch Army
their Confederates, Commanded by the Earl of Livin, had joyntly besieged the City of York, the Metropolis of that County, and whereof the Earl of Newcastle was Governour for the King, who over and above his Garison which was ve∣ry strong, had also a brave and gallant Army, Prince Rupert was sent by the King to raise that Siege, with such considerable Forces, as being joyned to those of the Earl of Newcastle, did well nigh equallize the Parliaments in number. The three Parliament Generals did immediatly raise the Siege to encounter Prince Rupert, and the Earl of Newcastle, drew forth also his Forces out of the Town, and both Armies being drawn up in Battell-Array upon Marston Moore,The Bat∣tell of Marston Moor. they both fought with a great deal of Fury, Animo∣sity, and hopes of Victory, which at first seemed to incline to the Kings Part, the right Wing of the Parliaments Forces Commanded by the Lord Fairfax, having the disadvantage of the Ground, was over-whelmed by the left Wing of the Kings Party, who routed and defeated it: But his late Highness (who as then was stiled but a Colonel) whose after Appellations I shall observe by degrees, which Fortune advan∣ced him to) who commanded the left Wing, and had not the least advantage of the Ground, did so violently set upon the right Wing of the Kings Party, as that he brake in peeces Prince Ruperts best Regiments, and forced them not only to give way, but to turn their Backs, and suffering only some part of his Men to pursue the Enemy, he with the rest made half a turn about
and charged the Enemies main Battell in the Rear so vigorously, as that putting Life again in∣to the Lord Fairfax's Souldiers, he constrained them to face about, and thereby so well resto∣red the Success of the Battell, as that he obtain∣ed and Entire and compleat Victory. Two Ge∣nerals of the Enemies, and some of the best mounted of their Officers only making their es∣capes by their Horses good heels; and this Bat∣tell was accounted the greatest that ever was fought during these last Wars. His High∣ness admi∣rable ma∣nagement of the Bar∣tell at Nazeby. The same thing likewise hapned in the fa∣mous Battell of Naseby, neer unto Northampton; when as his late Highness ariving in the Camp but on the Evening before the Fight, gave such encouragement and joy to the whole Ar∣my, by reason of his so suddain and unexpected Arivall from so great a distance of place, as that it presaged an undoubted Victory. The left Wing of the Parliaments Army was quite over borne; General Ireton his late Highness Son-in-Law, and who afterward governed Ireland in the Quality of Lord Deputy, with as much Prudence and Conduct as he shewd Valour and Deserts to merit so considerable an Imployment, being the second Person of the Common-wealth, was carried off from the Field by two Wounds he received, and was taken Prisoner, but was relieved again, and Prince Rupert pursued his Victory with as much vigour and hopes to gain the Battell, as if the day had been his own: But his late Highness on his side defeating that Wing which was oposite to him, charged them
with such force and Courage, as that he made the Victory dubious, and so it continued for a good while, neither inclining to the one side, not the other, till at last the Kings Horse falling a running, left their Foot to shift for themselves, which were all cut in pieces and taken Prisoners, all the Canon & Baggage was likewise taken, of a considerable value; there was also found a Ca∣binet of the Kings with his Papers of great Importance: The royall Standard, and one hun∣dred Colours beside were brought off, and his late Highness having pursed the Kings Horse as long as he listed, at length returned to the Camp with a great number of Prisoners. Should I go about to number up the severall places of con∣sequence which this Conquerour hath taken, either by force or by Capitulations, I should fill up a whole Volume with the Names of Towns and Fortresses alone, besides intending hereby only to give you a Perspective of his glorious Life: I will only instance in those worthy A∣ctions of his, whereby the Fortunes of the Wars did decide the possession of three King∣domes. The Vi∣ctory of Preston in Lancashire.Nor may we omit to reckon amongst the rest of his Heroick Atchievements, the Victory which he obtained by Preston in Lancashire, over Duke Hamilton, and Sir Marmaduke Langdale, whose united Forces amounted unto 25000, his late Higness having not above 10000 at most, notwithstanding which inequallity of Forces he gave them Battell, and entirely routed that
puissant Army, killing 3000 Scotch upon the place, and taking 9000 Prisoners, chasing the remaining Forces to Warrington about 20 Miles from the place where the Battell was fought, and taking Duke Hamilton Prisoner, at a place called Ʋttoxeter, whither he was retired with 3000 Horse, as also Sir Marmaduke Langdale, the one by my Lord Grey, and Colonel White, and the other by Captain Widmonpoole, so that but few Scotch returned to their own Country, to cary back the News of so prodigious a De∣feat. NO sooner were the Civill Wars of England terminated by the discomsiture of all the Kings Armies, the taking of his own Person, and by his death, but the Parliament by a so∣lemn Vote and Ordinance, changed the Monar∣chiall Government into a Common-wealth.The Mo∣narchiall Govern∣ment changed into a Common Wealth. The Kingdome of Ireland was the first that wit∣nessed a discontent of this Change, and all the severall Parties there uniting themselves on the News of this Change, they owned the late Kings Son, and joyned all their Forces against the Interest of the Common-wealth, and on a suddain became so powerfull and formidable, as that the chief Places in those Parts submitted to their obedience, Dublin only, and London Derry excepted, the first whereof was immediatly be∣sieged by an Army of 22000 Men, Commanded by the Marquis of Ormond, and the other by a considerable Party, the Natives of the Country.
The Royallists were as yet in possession of the Isles of Jersey and Man, which places although they were adjacent unto England, yet they only stood them in stead for a retreat to some Ships, which robbed up and down the Seas in those Parts: Nor were the Irish Businesses there arri∣ved at the height of perfection, whereas they be∣gan to decline: Forces sent into Ireland.for 3000 Horse and Foot which the Parliament sent into Ireland, as the forerun∣ner only of a more considerable Body being safe∣ly landed at Dublin, joyned themselves unto the Garison, and unto the rest of the Forces which could be got together in a Body, which in all amounted not unto above 9000 Men, and who joyntly made so generall and vigorous a Sally upon the Marquis of Ormond (which Sal∣ly was so well ordered by the Prudence of Co∣lonel Michael Jones, and so well encouraged and led on by his Prudence and Valour together) as that they forced the Marquis to quit the Siege, and so well prosecuted the point of their Victory, as that they cut all the said Marquises Troops in pieces, who with much ado saved himself; there were slain in the Combat and pursuit about 2000 Men, as many were taken Prisoners, and all the Ammunition of War, with the Baggage and Ordnance were likewise left behind as a Prey to the Besieged. General Cromwell goes for Ireland, and ar∣rives there in August, 1649. And the better to advance this generall De∣feat, and to cause these puissant Confederates the sooner to run into their Ruine, who a little before promised themselves no less then the
Conquest of the three Kingdomes; Oliver Cromwell being by the Common-wealth nomi∣nated Governour of Ireland, took footing at Dub∣lin with an Army furnished with all Necessaries requisite toward the Crowning of an Underta∣king, which already had so happy and successfull a beginning. But General Cromwell having in vain sought for the Enemies, who by these addition all For∣ces were forced to take Sanctuary in the best pla∣ces and Fortresses of the Country, at length be∣sieged Drogedah,Drogedah in Ireland besieged. one of the best and consider∣ablest places in all Ireland, defended by so strong a Garison as it might well have framed a little Army, and was commanded by such Officers as had been signallized beyond the Seas, whose numbers were so exceeding great, as that several of them bare Armes only as private Souldiers. There was no time spent in the framing of a Siege, or in the opening of Approaches, but each one minded the beating of the Iron whilst it was hot, and concluded that the Confederates ought not to be suffered to rally themselves, nor to unite in a Body again, wherefore a slight Breach being made, the Orders were given out for a generall Assault, but the Walls were lined with so many and so good Men chiefly in those places where the Assault was to be given, as that the solidst and gravest Officers of the Army did represent unto his Excellency the General, that there was no appearance at all to carry the place by force, but that it would be better to
tyre and weary out the besieged by the length of a siege, during which the breach might be made the larger. But Generall Cromwell, whose prudence (as we have already observed) secon∣ded his valour, did briskly answer them that he would goe and open the breach for them, and placing himselfe at the head of his Troops, caused the assault to be given, rendring this example of wisdome to all great Personages, that in Actions of important consequence nei∣ther Age, nor great Commands, or high Prefer∣ments, ought to hinder a General to be the first man to goe on upon an assault, since it must ren∣der them the most considerable, and raise them up to the highest pitch of honour and esteem. Finally, after a sharp and bloody contest hand to hand, most obstinately maintained on all sides, the English forced their entrance, and the General went into the place pell mell with his Souldiers, at which time the ardour and heat of the victory did appear to correspond with his prudence, for though his generosity did oblige him to give quarter to those who had so well defended themselves, not∣withstanding, deeming it fitting to make that place an example of terror unto the rest of the Towns which were garrisoned, and which might cost him too dear should they stand out as sturdily and obstinately as these did, he cau∣sed all those to be put to the sword who were found to be in Arms, & thus he sacrificed 3000
Irish unto the Ghosts of 10000 English whom they had massacred some years before. The ta∣king of this place was followed by the surren∣der of several others, fear causing the weakest to yield, but those which were able to defend themselves were sold at dear rates. Trin, Dun∣dalke, Nury, Wexford, Rne, Bandonbridge and Kingsale were subdued, this last being a very con∣siderable passage, so likewise were several other places taken by the respective Commanders of the Common-wealth, at the self same time in the other parts of Ireland, and several parties of the Enemies field-Forces were likewise de∣feated by Sir Charles Coot, Collonel Venables and Jones, and the Lord Broghill, each of them signalizing themselves according to their ac∣customed valours, and the Lord Broghill having since made it appear in the managing of States affairs that he is as great a Politician as a Soul∣dier. One would have imagined that the im∣petrous course of these victories should abso∣lutely have quelled and abated the courage of the Irish, or that force and might would soon have reduced them to terms of reason, but they held out for a long time together in unaccessa∣ble places, in Woods and Bogges, over which none but the Natives both Horse and Men can passe without perishing, which doth manifest unto us, that the Conquest of that Island is not so easie at present, as it was formerly when Henry the second of England reduced it in one Winter, which, as certain Writers say, is almost
incredible. That so populous a Nation, so har∣dy, so well disciplined, so active and dexterous, should not so much as lift up a hand to defend themselves: But as the same writer saith, it is apparent that they were not accustomed to our manner or wayes of warring, nor to defend themselves against such kinde of weapons as were then used; however, if the Conquest was easie, the preservation was not found to be so, and cost farre dearer. True it is, that this last Conquest of that Nation was not so suddenly archieved, but those means which have been used to assure and preserve it, will give occasi∣on unto our nephewes,—that this present age hath much profited by the faults and omissions of our Ancestors. Moreover, that fire which the Civil Warres had kindled: in the Britannick Islands, was so violent, as that all the Sea which separates the Old World from the New, was not capable to hinder the Communicati∣on thereof even to their Colonies in America, for Virginia and the Carybde Islands refused to acknowledge the power of the Common-wealth, all those who inclined thereunto were either banished or executed, and despoyled of their goods, and however those Collonies could not subsist but by the Commerce of Eng∣land, and that this Revolt did bring along with it their ruine, yet their obstinacy was such, as that they would neither yield to their own In∣terest nor Reason. Till at length the Com∣mon-wealth sent a Fleet thither, under the
Command of Sir George Askue, who delivered them out of their miseries, by ranging them under the obedience of the Parliament. Mean∣while the Royallists Forces were very conside∣rable at Sea, for Prince Rupert had a Fleet of nine great Ships which served to shelter seve∣ral other small ones, whereby the trade of Eng∣land was much impeded and incommodated, which obliged the Parliament to put forth a most puissant Naval Army to Sea, fitted with good Mariners, and all kinde of necessary war-like Ammunitions. The sole brute of this Fleet made all the Enemies Ships to run into their several skulking holes like unto so many Conies, and Prince Rupert being not strong enough to encounter them, was forced to retire into Kingsale Haven in Ireland, where he was im∣mediately blocked up by the Parliaments Fleet, whilest General Cromwell besieged both the Port and Town by land, and Prince Rupert be∣ing forced to make a vertue of necessity, resol∣ved to bear the brunt of all the English Fleet, and so saved himself, leaving behinde him three Ships, which by that occasion were taken, and finally after several turnings and turmoilings, be cast anchor at Lisbone, where he was pro∣tected by the King of Portugal, which caused the rupture betwixt this Common-wealth and that Crown, and all those mischiefs which en∣sued, as we hereafter shall rehearse. Meanwhile the Royallists in Scotland seeing the Parliament was busied in Ireland, thought to
lay hold on a fit opportunity to play their game, and to that purpose the Earle of Mon∣trosse having landed in the North of Scotland, with some Forces he had raised in Holland and other parts, assembled the old Souldiers who had formerly served under him, and armed them with such Arms as he had brought from Hol∣land, but before he could make a considerable body, he was defeated by the Presbyter Forces, taken, and hanged on a very high Gibbet, which is the last mark of infamy in that Coun∣trey. Within a while after, there was a Treaty commenced at Breda, between the Scots and their King, to install and re-establish him in that Kingdome, and in the others, according as Fortune should answer their designs and ex∣pectations; and to this end, they deputed Am∣bassadors into Spain, Italy, Denmarke, Sweden, Russia, and into Turkey, and finally throughout all Europe, to demand relief, aid and assistance: But all their Embassies procured neither men nor money, only their Ambassadors were laden with Complements and good wishes in return, each others particular affairs not permitting them to do more. All which gave unto the Common-wealth of England, not any great fears, but great jea∣lousies, wherefore the better to be informed of the passages abroad, and the better to fortifie themselves by foraign Leagues and Alliances, M. Dorislaus a person full of knowledge and
conduct, was sent in the quality of an Agent towards the States of the United Provinces, the chief drift of this Negotiation being to criment a good and firm understanding between the two Common-wealths: But scarce was he arrived at the Hague, when five or six disguised persons entred forcibly into his Chamber and massacred him. And whilest it seemed all things were a profound Calm in England, or that at least the course of the Enemies designs both at home and abroad, being sufficiently known to the State, on a suddain there sprang up the most formidable faction that ever was hatch'd since these last Warres: A certain number of persons who called themselves Levellers, whose pre∣tenses were to render all mens goods and pos∣sessions alike, and truely this was a very plau∣sible design, and might doubtlesse have met with as many Abetters as there are men in the world, who have no other possessions or Revenues, but their good wills to obtaine them. The chief of these Levellers was one John Lilborn, a man of a dating and attempting spi∣rit, who could not remain quiet, but was alto∣gether invincible, not to be moved by threats nor gained by the favour or presents of fortune, which were beneath the extent of his ambiti∣on, and a considerable part of the Army siding with their Leader, they augmented in numbers as fast as the shortnesse of the time would per∣mit, the confluence of such men as flattered
themselves with such fond hopes, and who promised themselves a revenge, and and esta∣blishment by a second Revolution and change. But before all those who intended to have sided with them could come up to them and unite in one body, they were vigorously set upon by the Lord Fairfax, at that time the Common-wealths General, who defeated them at a place called Burford in the County of Oxford, where their Leader and the best part of his Souldiers were taken, some of which were put to death for example sake, and some others were ba∣nish'd, but the greatest part were pardoned, and admitted into favour again. As for their Leader John Lilborne being brought up to London, he appeared before the chief Officers and Judges of London and West∣minster, the Lord Maior, Sheriffs, and divers others, where he was not only accused of di∣vers Martial Crimes, but also Politick ones, as having been the Author of several scandalous and defamatory. Libells against the State, which tended to render the Government odious, and to beget a Mutiny in the people; however, he so dexterously shifted himself of all these accu∣sations, as that the Judges declared him Not guilty. Much about that very time Mr. Antho∣ny Ascham a most judicious and accomplished Gentleman, was Deputed, and sent over in the quality of an Agent to the King of Spain, and arrived at the Port of Sancta Maria, on the 5. of June, 1650. where being advertised but his
person was in danger, he was constrained to cause himself to be guarded to Madrid, where the next day after his arrival, as he was at Din∣ner, six men knocked at his Chamber doore, which was immediately opened unto them, and he rising from the Table to receive them, the first of the said parties stabbed him in the head with a Dagger, so that he fell down dead to the ground, and his Interpreter Signior Ri∣ba being not able to make his escape soon e∣nough, was likewise stabbed in the belly; which being thus done, the Murderers would have sa∣ved themselves in the Venetian Ambassadors house, who refused them protection, whence they retired themselves into a Church, which in Spain is a Sanctuary which the Justice ought not to violate, whence however the King of Spain had them taken, and put into prison, one only excepted, who made an escape. Hence there arose a great contest betwixt the King and the Clergy, who complain'd that their priviledges had been infringed, and demanded that the Prisoners might be returned unto them: and on the other side, the Parliament of England pressed hard to have justice done on them, and though message upon message, in∣stance upon instance were used therein, yet they took no effect. And lest it may seem that all these foraign Negotiations which we have here inserted, may be beyond my subject, however if they be considered as so many obstacles which Fortune opposed unto the vertue and
greatness of his late Highness, you will find that the recitall of them will not be altogether use∣lesse, the rather since I have related them as succinctly as possibly: Besides, we may also look upon them as so many seeds sowen, to beget those warres which thereon ensued, and which were by the late Protector, rather by most glorious Treaties whereunto he was sought, or by most signal Victories which were obtain'd, and brought to a happy period, by which the blood of these two Agents, so cru∣elly murdered, were retaliated with use. But to go on to our History, the Treaty of Breda being absolutely concluded, and notwithstan∣ding the great Antipathy and animosity be∣tween the Royallists and the Presbyterians, all their jealousies and grudges were seemingly re∣concised, so that the Scotch wanted nothing to compleat their design, but to enjoy their Kings preserce, who immediately coming to the Hague, went thence for Schevelinge, and em∣barqued himself for Scotland notwithstanding the dangers and perils of the Sea, which were very great, and the English Ships which had way-laid him to surprize him. As soon as he was landed in Scotland, the first thing they pro∣pounded unto their King was to take the so∣lemn Oath, called the Covenant, that burning Torch which the Mother of Paris did see in her frenzies, that fatal fire which the Scotch believe descended from Heaven, and by which they at their pleasures kindle those warres where∣with
they infest England, which Covenant as we know was only a superstitious and warlike Prorestation made in the presence of God and Men: To maintain the purity of the Religion, to preserve the priviledges of Parliament, and the peo∣ple, and to re-establish the King in his Ancestors Throne. But that which seemed somewhat harsh and rude to this Prince, was the terms wherein they caused him to take this Oath, quite contrary to Physitians, who dip their Pills in Syrrops or Sugar, to make them down the glibber, yet these Politicians when the whole lay at the stake, it seems, troubled themselves not much with the wording of the thing; for amongst real friends indeed, there needs not many com∣plements nor much complacence to be used. Therefore the Churches of Scotland made their King swallow this restorative in the following Beverage, constraining him to protest, That he renounced the sinnes of his Fathers and his own house, the Idolatry of his Mothers, and that he would adhere unto Gods cause in con∣formity to the Covenant, in the firm establish∣ment of the Church Government, as it was ex∣pressed in the Directory, for that publick wor∣ship which is to be rendred to God, contained in the Belief and Catechism: And this Cup he was forced to drink, that he might obtain his Fathers Kingdome, which formalities were more then requisite for to establish that Prince in the opinion of the prevailing party, which
was only then in a condition to help him. The Com∣mon-wealth prepares to war a∣gainst the Scots.Howbeit the English knew very well to distin∣guish between these Artificial fictions, and the truth, for the Parliament of England being duely informed of the Scots, their designs and practi∣ses, thought it was high time to think of the best means to oppose them, and after several con∣sultations upon this businesse, it was resolved that the Lord Fairfax should command the Army in chief, and with all speed march toward the North of England. But he most humbly thanked the Parliament, and like unto a second Cincinatus, retired himself from the Dictator∣ship to a Countrey-life, excusing himself for not serving them in that Expedition, upon his In∣disposition at that time. His late Highness made Ge∣neralissi∣mo of the Common-wealths Armies.The Renown of Ge∣neral Cromwells feats of Arms, both as Gover∣nour and Conqueror of Ireland, admitted of no lesse Proposals, then to make him Generalissi∣mo of the Common-wealths Armies, in the Lord Fairfax his stead: So that he came over again into England, whilest his hands were as yet warm, and was sent to give a check unto other Enemies in another Climate, and under another disguise, after he had settled and assured all the Conquests of Ireland, and had left the ne∣cessary and requisite Orders, conducing to a so∣lid peace and establishment of those parts, with his sonne-in-Law Henry Ireton, so that he re∣turned thence laden with Palms and Laurels, as Trophies of his worthy Acts in those parts. And scarce was he returned home, but he was
enforced to march towards those parts, whither the glory of Conquering a second Kingdome called upon him. Now the Scots, who by no means would make any outward shew of the grand designs which they were hatching, at the approach of the English Army on their Fron∣tiers, seemed to be very much astonished, and the whole Countrey took the Allarum, more∣over, the better to colour this their astonish∣ment and seeming surprizal, they deputed a Messenger to Sir Arthur Haslerigge, as then Governour of Newcastle, upon the Borders of England and Scotland, to know the reason of that so suddain March of the English Army to∣wards their Frontiers, whereunto they joyned several Manifesto's, setting forth the Contents of the Leagues and ample Treaties of union be∣tween the two Nations, and several other par∣ticulars, which served only to gain time, and to make the better preparations to receive their Enemies. At the same time of the English Ar∣mies advance towards the North, the Parlia∣ment set forth a Manifest accompanyed by ano∣ther from the General, and chief Officers of the Army, whereby both the one and the o∣thers declared, viz. A Mani∣fest con∣cerning the Scotch warre.That the reasons which moved them to this great undertaking, was nei∣ther the support which they expected from the Arm of flesh, nor the consideration or vanity of former successes, not the desire they had to compasse any of their own designs; But the true assurance they had, that their cause was just
before God; reflecting on the foregoing Re∣volutions, and the successe which had followed them, not as the handy-work of Politick men, or of Humane force, but as the most eminent works of Providence, and the power of God, thereby to make his good will appear, and to shew his pleasure concerning those things which he had decreed in this world: That they were obliged, not to betray the cause wherein God had so evidently manifested himself, after which there was nothing more dear unto them then the preservation of those who feared the Lord, and who might greatly suffer either by being mistaken, or by not being capable to dis∣cern the true tye of a Generall Calamity, of which their Christian charity they hoped they had given sufficient proofs, at the last time, when they were in Scotland with this very Ar∣my, of which God was pleased to make use, for to break in pieces the power of those who oppressed the faithfull in those parts. But that the acknowledgements of so signal a favour, did but little appear in the Engagement which they had lately made with their new King, and that they had not proceeded like unto good Christians, in publishing that their Army was but an Army of Sectaries: However, that they doubted not, but that God would give them the grace to forgive them that calumny, and to that effect they beseeched him to be so good unto them, as to separate the Chaffe from the good Corn, concluding in like manner as they had
begun by a most solemn and terrible Impreca∣tion, beseeching that in testimony of the truth of all these particulars, the great God of Heaven, through his infinite mercy pardoning their fail∣ings and weaknesses, would judge betwixt them when they should come to joyn in battle with their Enemies. This Manifesto was sent from the Generals quarters, as then at Barwick, to the Metropolitan of Scotland, by a Trumpet, whose eyes the Scots did blinde both going and coming. Meanwhile the Army advanced as farre as the Lord Mordingtons Castle, on the 22 of July, 1650. and refreshed there three days, on the 25. they advanced towards Copperspeth, and the 26. they arrived at Dunban where the Army received those Ammunitions wherewith such Ships were laden, as were come thither on purpose to observe the motions of the Army, by reason that the Peasants had abandoned their dwellings, not leaving so much as any thing which might serve for refreshing. The Army being somewhat refreshed at Dunbar, marched toward Haddington, and the next day understood, that the Enemies were disposed to give them battle on a Heath called Gladsmore, so that the English endeavoured to possesse themselves of the place. But the Scots appear∣ed not, whereupon it was resolved, that Major General Lambert, and Collonel Whalley per∣sons of an approved valour (and who have since proved themselves as great Politicians as they were great Commanders) should with 1400.
Horse advance towards Muscleborough, to en∣deavour if possible to draw forth the Enemy, and to engage him to fight, whilest the rest of the Army marched up unto them, whereupon there happened some slight skirmishes, but the Scots would not by any means be engaged in a general Combat, so that the English that night encamped hard by Muscleborough, from whence the Scots were but four miles distant, defended by a brest-work which they had drawn from Edinborough to Leith, and which was well nigh flanked all the way by the Ca∣non of the last place, so that they were pos∣sessed of a very advantagious Port. The English being approached unto Muscleborough with a resolution to have set upon the Enemy in their works, found that it was a difficult matter to force their Line, and so were constrained to set down their Camp hard by that place all the day, to discover the countenance of the Ene∣my: But the desire they had to fight was some∣what abated by a great showre of rain, which continued all the day, and which did much in∣commodate them, by reason they had no shel∣ter at all. On the 30. finding that they were put to it for want of Victuals, and the ground being so throughly soaked by the rain, as that it was farre more difficult to attempt the Ene∣my then before, the English retired to their former quarters; which begat heart in the Scots, who fallyed out of their Lines, and fell so fiercely upon the Rearguard of the English,
as that they put them into a kinde of disorder, but some Squadrons of Horse fronting in the Rear, and making good the ground, assured the March of the foot, and so vigorously continu∣ed their charge, as that they had like to have brought the businesse to a general Combate; had not the Commander in chief of the Scots Army caused a retreat to be sounded, that so they might bring their men into their Lines a∣gain, whither the English pursued them, fight∣ing all the way with their Cavallry. In this Encounter, Major General Lambert ingaged so farre, as that he was hurt in the Arm with a Launce, and received another wound in the body, and once he was taken prisoner, but was rescued again by Lieutenant Empson of the Generals Regiment, there were but few English killed, but farre more of the Scotch, and amongst them some persons of quality, several prisoners of theirs were also taken, as a Lievtenant Co∣lonel, a Major, and some Captains. By which means the English recovered Muscleborough that night without being molested by the Enemy, but they were so disheartened for want of sleep, and so tyred by the dirty slabbery wayes, as that misdoubting least the enemy being aware thereof might give them an Alarum, that night they stood upon their guard, and accordingly they failed not betwixt three and four of the clock in the Morning, with fifteen Companies of choice Horse, commanded by Major Gene∣ral Montgomery, and Collonel Straughton, to
fall into the English quarters with such a vehe∣mency as that they bare down the Guards, and put a whole Regiment of Horse in disorder, whereby the whole Army taking the Alarum, the English charged them so home as that they put them into a rout, and pursued them within half a League of Edinbourgh, killing them a sufficient number both of Officers and Souldiers, and taking several prisoners: After which, the Scots being disgusted at these their ill successes, retired themselves for a while within their intrenchments, where we shall al∣so leave them to their closer guards. In the meanwhile the Parliament interdicted the Commerce between England and Scotland, and caused their Ships to be adjudged good Prize, which contributed very much to their undoing and ruine: During which they wanted for no Partisanes in England, who laboured to dispose things toward the effecting of their grand design, and amongst their chief Agita∣tors, Collonel Eusebius Andrewes being disco∣vered and convinced, was also condemned and beheaded on Tower-hill. The whole Moneth of August passed almost away without any action in Scotland, towards the latter end whereof, Collington and Readhall were taken by attempt, where the Lord Hamil∣ton and Major Hamilton were taken, with 60. Souldiers, 60. Barrels of Powder, Armes for 60 men, and a considerable quantity of Victu∣als, and other good Booty, all which hapned on the 24 of August.
After which the whole Body of the English Army quitted the Mountains of Pencland, and encamped about Collington and Readhall, and the parts adjacent within one Mile of the Scotch Army; on the seven and twentieth both Ar∣mies marched Flank to Flank, being only se∣perated by a little Quagmire or Marsh-ground, which hindred their Conjuction, however the Canon played upon each other, and on the 28th the English Canon plyed the Scots hard, and endamaged them very much, notwithstand∣ing they neither quitted their Ground, nor would they come to a Resolution to joyn in a closer Fight. And the English having consu∣med all their Provisions of Victualls, retired un∣to their former Quarters, first unto Pencland Hills, and afterwards unto Mussleborough whi∣ther they had much ado to reach, where being some what refreshed, they dreyned their Gari∣sons, assembled also their Forces, and took their March toward Hoddington, at which the Scots coasting their March on their right Wing, did charge them with a Squadron of stout Men, and as they did most briskly set upon the English, so they were in like manner vigorously repulst by a Regiment of Foot commanded by Colonel Fairfax: On the first day of September both Ar∣mies found themselves only seperated by the Town and the Scots, being encamped in an ad∣vantagious place, on the West-side of the Town the English were engaged to encamp themselves on the East-side of the Town, in an open Field,
very fit to give Battel in, without that either Party would give or take advantage of the Ground, where the English having attended the Enemies a sufficient space of time, and percei∣ving that they would not fight but upon an ad∣vantage, they took their March towards Dunbar, whither the Scots followed them immediatly, and at a certain passage endeavoured to charge their Rearguard; But the English immediatly facing about, the Scots changed their resolution and gained the Hills, where they thought they might with advantage cut off the English their passage to Coperspeth: at which time the English Army was but in a very ill Condition, the Winter wch begins betimes in those parts had so nipt them with Colds and great Rains, and the ill Victuals which they had besides, caused a great deal of sickness in the Army, Fluxes, Loosness, and other Diseases, whereby many died, and were rendred uncapable of Service, being sent and carried away to Barwick, and the adjoyning parts. The Scots who very well knew the sad estate of the English Army, which they had really blocked up at the passage of Copperspeth, which is betwixt Dunbar and Barwick, thereby impe∣ding the English's Communication with that place, and by hindring them from those Conve∣niencies which they thence received, intending either to overcome them there, or to cause them to perish there for want of Necessaries, so that they promised themselves an unquestionable
Victory without much loss on their sides, wher∣by they presumed to brag that they had gotten the English in the Earl of Essex's Pensold, allu∣ding to that extremity whereunto the Royal∣lists had reduced that Earle in the County of Cornwall. where his Army surrendred at discre∣tion (the Horse only excepted, who made their way through the Enemy in the Night-time.) Nor were the Scots their hopes ill grounded, considering the ill plight wherein the English Army was at that time, and the inequality of their Forces, the Scots being at the least 20000 Men, and the English not above 12000, divers of which were likewise sick: But the extremity whereunto the English were reduced, made them pitch upon so firm a resolution, either to overcome, or to die in the Battel, as that the Scots were totally routed and defeated, by those very reasons, and that very confidence which had made them as it were sure of the Victory. The B∣te of Dunia gainte by the EnglishWherefore the General, and the chief Officers of the English Army, deeming that the longer they should delay, to put it to a noble adven∣ture, whereby to get out of this great straight wherein they were, the lesse they should be able to compass it, resolved either to make their passage through their Enemies by the points of their Swords, or to perish in the under∣taking; So that they imployed the whole Night in seeking of the Lord, and imploring his Assi∣stance from Heaven, as also in giving out and distributing the Orders requisite for the Fight,
and just at break of the day, the Army was rea∣dy drawn up into Battel-aray, and to give the on-set; the English word was, The Lord of Hoastes: and the Scots word was, The Covenant, which did very well represent the state of their Affairs, and the subject of their Quarrell, and in an instant both the English Horse and Foot, with a gallant resolution, fiercely charged the right Wing of the Scots, where the Enemy had placed all their Cavalry, on purpose to hin∣der the English in their passage that way. The Scots received their Charge with a great deal of constancy and resolution, and it may justly be said, That Alexander did not meet with more resistance, nor glory at the passage of Granicia, then our late Protector met with at this En∣counter; especially if so be we consider, how that the said Conquerour of Asia had to do with an effeminate kind of People, bred in a delici∣ous Country, accustomed to their ease and plea∣sures; but here on the contrary, That the Eng∣lish brought up in a fertile abundant Soil, and under a middle Climate, should come to con∣front a War-like Nation in a harsh, barren, and cold Climat. The General's own Regiment of Foot had the Vanguard that day, and perfor∣med the parts of men, answering most glorious∣ly to that honour which belonged to them: Their Colonel and General together animating ad encouraging them by his own example, witnessed by his Actions, that there was not a straws breadth that day betwixt them and death
or the Victory: Major General Whaley charg∣ed the Enemies whole Army through and through, with his Regiment; bearing down all those who durst withstand him, and without the loss of many men; having wheeled about a∣gain, and cleared all before him, regained his former station himself, having only received a slight Wound in the Arm, and had a Horse kil∣led under him. And not to detain the Reader in any further suspence, all the Regiments of the Army performing their parts, like resolute gal∣lant men, (For should a man go about to praise one Squadron or Battallion of them in particular, he must of necessity derogate from the rest) you might have observed as many Sol∣diers as Officers, & as many Officers as Soldiers, who being all of them animated, or rather in∣spired by a supernaturall instinct of Valour, a man would have thought they had been invulne∣rable, or shot-free, and that a Hand from on high did defend them from the showers of Lead and Launces, which were ready to overwhelme them, so that the violence and force wherewith they fought, did only permit the Scots to put by their Blows, as also it is worthy to be noted that in all this Fight the English lost but forty men, whereas of the Scots there were foure thousand killed upon the place, and that Army which was stronger then the English by two thirds, thinking to have overwhelmed them, did only by closing in upon them, force them to fight with the greater vigour; and you would
have imagined, that the little Army of the Eng∣lish consisted only of one Body, which had but one only motion, and charged the Enemy on all sides with so much Impetuosity and Animosity, as that you would have said it had been and in∣sensible Mass, or Lump which only pressed for∣wards, where the weight of Arms, or the force of Powder did transport it. Finally, after one whole hours dispute, very hot Fight, and vio∣lent furious Contests, the Scots gave way, and their Horse being put to flight, endeavoured to save themselves by the goodness of their heels, the English Cavalry pursuing them to Hadding∣ton, all the Scotch Foot remained on the place, and that which rendred the slaughter of them the greater was, that the English Soldiers re∣membred an Action which hapned the day be∣fore, in which thirty Soldiers of Colonel Prides Regiment being commanded to possess a House scituate betwixt both Camps, and not being se∣conded, were over-powred by a greater number of the Scots, and so forced to deliver up the place again, notwithstanding which, after they had promised quarter to the English, they kil∣led three of them, and hurt all the rest: There was no English Soldiers but had a Prisoner in this Battel, there being taken ten thousand, most of all which, except the Officers, were suffered to steal away, amidst which there was ten Co∣lonels, twelve Lievetenant Colonels, nine Ma∣jors, forty seven Captains, seventy two Livete∣nants, and eighty Ensigns, and amongst the Pri∣soners
of Quality, there was the Lord Libberton, and his Son, the Lord Cranstone, Sir James Lunds∣dale, Livetenant Generall of the Foot, and Sir Pickerten Adjutant General, all their Baggage and Canon was taken, to the number of two and twenty great Guns, and severall lesser ones, two hundred Colours, and Armes for 15000 Men; of the English there was but one Officer killed, and Major Rooksby, who afterwards died of his Wounds, as also Captain Sloyd of the Lord Fleetwoods Regiment, dangerously wounded. His late Highness obtained this me∣morable Victory on the third day of September, 1650, on which day he also obtained another no less famous then this: And on this very day God crowned his Labours with a peacefull and resolved quiet death, whereby he no less tri∣umphed over the World, and the rage of Hell, then he did in this last Battel we have related, over a most puissant raging Enemy; at which time his Army, as a man may say (brought low by Want, and Sicknesses) was even Bedrid, and at deaths very Door. And as the Parlia∣ment of England had caused a day of universall Prayers and Fastings to be kept for the good success of their Army in Scotland, so likewise did they order a day of generall Thansgiving for this so notable and famous Victory: and the General likewise on his part did not faile with the whole Army, to acknowledge the good handy work of God, who had so visibly gained him and them this Battel: And the better to
prosecute the said Victory, and Lieth ta∣ken.to reap the fruits thereof, On the seventh day of September, four Regiments of Foot were sent to possess Lieth, a very considerable and advantageous place, where seven and thirty piece of Ordnance were found mounted on Plat-forms, and a con∣siderable quantity both of Ammunitions of War and Provisions of Victuals. And on the same day his late Highness became Master of the Ci∣ty of Edinbrough, the Metropolitan of all Scot∣land, and caused his whole Army to march into it, without any loss, save the Arme of one Sol∣dier, which was shot off by a Canon-bullet from the Castle. Edinbo∣rugh ta∣ken.And on the next Lords-day he sent a Trumpeter to the Castle, to give notice to such Ministers as had abandoned their Pulpits, to come and perform their Duties in their said Callings, which they having refused to do, he caused English Ministers to Officiate in their places; in the mean while, all possible dili∣gence was used in the Fortifying of Lieth, it be∣ing concluded to be the best and most commo∣dious sheltring-place the English could have in Scotland, for the Winter Season. And after his late Highness had by sound of Trumpet, both at Lieth and Edinbrough, caused the freedome of Traffick, and liberty of Trade to be published and established, a sure way for the publick Mar∣kets, himself on the fourteenth marched to∣ward Nethrife, six miles from Edinbrough, lea∣ving Major General Overton with his Brigade in Edinborough. On the fifteenth the Army ad∣advanced
toward Linlithgo, but by reason of the ill Weather they could not pass on forward; On the sixteenth, they marched toward Falkirk, and the next day they came up within one mile of Sterling; On the eighteenth, the Councel of War being assembled, a Letter was drawn up to be sent thither, by which the tenderness and affection of the English towards the Scotch Na∣tion was represented, alledging that though formerly it had not taken its desired effects; Notwithstanding, seeing that at present the Fortune and Success of Armes had been so con∣trary to them, they desired them to reflect on those Proposals which had been formerly made unto them, and to surrender that place unto them, for the use of the Common-wealth of England, and a Trumpeter being sent with the aforesaid Letter, who coming up almost to the VValls, met with a Gentleman on foot, with a Pike in his hand, who told him he should not be suffered to come into the place, and that his Letter should in like manner not be received: In the Afternoon that very day, those of the Town sent a Trumpeter to demand the Priso∣ners, with a proffer to pay their Ransoms; To whom the General made answer, That they were not come into Scotland to trade in Men, nor to enrich themselves, but to do Service to the Com∣mon-wealth of England, and to settle and establish those Dominions. On the same day, Orders were issued to draw up the whole Army to the very VValls of the Town, and by setting scaling
Ladders to the place, to give a generall Assault, but after it was found that there was but a little appearance to effect the same, in regard of the good Condition the Place and Garison was in, they changed their resolution, and on the nine∣teenth the Army retired to Linlithgow, which was accounted a very fit place to make a Garison of, whereby both Sterling and Edinborough might be bridled and curbed, and the necessary Orders for the fortifying of the place being gi∣ven, there were five Troops of Horse left in Garison, and six Companies of Foot, and the Body of the Army returned to Edinborough, where on the twenty third of September, there was a day of Humiliation celebrated and so∣lemnly kept. And much about the same time the Churches of Scotland likewise ordered a solemn Festivall for the ensuing Reasons; Viz. I. To humble themselves before God, and to crave his pardon for having too much re∣lyed on the Arme of Flesh. II. For the wickedness and profaneness of their Armies. III. For the Spoils and other Misde∣meanours their Soldiers had committed in England.
IV. For having not sufficiently purged their Armies; that is to say, For not ha∣ving put out such persons as were not godly, and of their Belief. V. For the indirect and sinister Means which their Commissioners made use of in their Treaty with their King, and the indi∣rect waies by which they had brought him in∣to Scotland. VI. For their not having sufficiently purged the Kings Family. VII. For the just Grounds they had to believe that his Majesties repentance was not reall; nor from his heart. The be∣sieging of Edinbo∣rough Ca∣stle.The rest of the Month was imployed in the making of the Siege and Approaches against the Castle of Edinborough, and in applying the Mines to the VValls. And on the thirtieth the English with so much gallantry surprized one of their Bulwarks, as they carried thence three hundred Muskets, one Ensign, and severall other Armes, without the loss of one Man. On the first of October, the Besieged began to make their
Salleys to hinder the working of the Miners, up∣on whom they fired incessantly with their great and small Shot, yet however they continued their Sappinges. Upon the second of the said Month, upon notice that severall Armes and Ammunitions of VVar were hidden in the Ca∣thedrall Church at Edinborough they were trans∣ported thence. VVhilst the fortifying of Leith was carried on vigorously, as well as the Mines under the Castle of Edinborough, that no time might be lost; his late Highness whose great Soul could not live without Action, and who was not to be taken up by one or two single Ob∣jects, marched off with part of the Army to go and view Glascow, which having done, and find∣ing that he was not in a Condition to assail it at that time, he returned back to Edinborough; but by the way, he rased two strong Holds whi∣ther the Moss Troopers were accustomed to re∣treat and shelter. And as the Scots had a puis∣sent Enemy in the heart of their Country, so had they a far greater in their very Bowels, since its generally confest, That the greatest of all Evils which can possibly happen to a State, Is the Divisions which the different professions in Religion, and the other particular Interests do beget: For in the North of Scotland, there was a Party for the King, seperated from the Chur∣ches, in the VVest, there was a Party for the Church seperated from the King; so likewise there was a third Party more moderate, who held both for King and Church, and all these in∣testine
Divisions were carryed on with such a violent animosity, as that they neglected the common good, and were even ready to cut each others throat: The last of these parties was the strongest, being composed of the Ge∣neral States of the Kingdome, as then held at Sterling, who neverthelesse stood upon their Guards, as well as the several others did, they being afraid of each other. The Assembly of the Estates used their best endeavours to recon∣concile these two parties, and to this purpose treated mainly with the Colonels Carre and Straughan, who seemed to be the chief Heads of the said parties, but they could not prevail with them. His late Highnesse who was al∣wayes as politick as vigilant, endeavoured to make good use of their dissentions, and so wrote both unto Carre and Straughan, but their particular quarrels hindred them not to joyn in their general animosities against the English, whom they reputed to be their com∣mon Enemy. But the said proffers which were made unto them, having as little wrought upon them as the care of their own preserva∣tions, Colonel Whaley was commanded with a good Squadron of the Army, to goe and re∣duce them to their obedience, which he un∣dertook not, however, before he had once more assayled to gain them by fair means, wherefore he sent a Letter unto them both, representing unto them in substance as fol∣loweth, viz.
That all the world knew how many ami∣cable wayes and endeavours had been used by the English since their being in Scotland, to hinder the effusion of Christian blood; and al∣though all the said undertakings had proved fruitlesse, yet they still harboured the same thoughts and resolutions, continuing thus, that their arms were alwayes ready and open to re∣ceive and embrace them, whensoever it should please God to inspire them to meet them half∣way. That their design was not to rule over them, nor to intrench upon their liberties, far lesse on their Church Government, or to pos∣sesse their goods and fortunes, their drift being only to advance the Lords work: But if they perished in their blindnesse, and would conti∣nue to harbour frivolous and vain hopes, they must continue to be their enemies to their rests, and declared unto them, that all the miseries which should befall them hereafter, either by the sword or famine, would fall very heavy on their own accompt. Collonel Carr sent an answer to this Letter quite in another strain then it might have been expected from persons who professed to desire nothing so much as an accommodation; and this Answer was returned to Commissary Ge∣neral Whaley, at his being at Carlisle, accor∣ding to the tenour following, or very nigh the same: That although they were not strong e∣nough to resist the English their unjust Inva∣sion, yet that they had strength enough to un∣dergoe
it, and that by their actions and suffer∣ings they would submit themselves to the will of God, untill the time of their deliverance should come: That in case they should have the happinesse to perish in doing of their du∣ties, it would be too much grace that God would do unto them, that they doubted not but when their miseries should be arrived at the full pitch, their Fortune would then change, adding that they thought it very strange, that the Eng∣lish should mention a cessation of Arms at the same time when they laded their Subjects with Irons, when they took their Towns, when they imprisoned their Ministers, and by this means bereaved their flocks (now going astray) of the only and best comforts which they had left unto them amidst their greatest miseries: Concluding thus, That if they would voluntarily desert and relinquish Scotland, and afterwards enter upon a Treaty in such a manner as becommeth Christians to doe, it would be a reciprocal grace and favour they would doe un∣to both Nations. But these Interparlies having proved thus unprofitable, the English began to fall to work again, and Major Brown possessed himself of a strong place called Ball-house, and afterwards took the Castle of Dorlington, in which there were great store of Ammunitions of warre found, and in this last some Mosse-Troopers, some of which were put to death. Collonel Monke likewise with a party both of Horse and Foot, marched towards the Castle
of Rozellar within seven miles of Edinborough, which was also surrendred after some Granado Shells were fired into it: Immediately after which Colonel Lambert marched with 2000 Horse towards Dumfreez, in quest of Colonel Carre who was about Peblies, and likewise Colonel Whalley who commanded a Squadron of that partie, took Dalkeith on his march, which meerly surrendred upon the threats which he sent in unto those who defended it, although the walls of the said Castle were 13 foot thick, and that they were well stored with Canon, Arms, and all kinde of warlike Ammu∣nitions, and provisions of victuals. Mean∣while Colonel Lambert having with much difficulty passed the River Hamilton, encamp∣ed there that night, whereof Colonel Carre having notice, did endeavour to surprize him the next morning at the very break of day, which he likewise did very briskly, but the English having opportunely taken the Alarum, and being unwilling that any of the Enemies forces should escape out of their hands, did surround them in such a manner, as that they found themselves at one and the self same time set upon on all sides. The English in a trice killed them 100 men, and took as many pri∣soners: Not could the Scotch Horse escape their clutches, so that they dismounted 400. Horse-men, whose Horses and baggage they brought away, and might have had the men too, but that they would not stand to trouble themselves with so many Prisoners, but rather
follow the Run-awayes, and so contented them∣selves to take the most considerable persons: They chased the Scots as farre as Aire Town: Colonel Carre himself was wounded and ta∣ken Prisoner, together with his Captain-Leiv∣tenant, as well as his Lievtenant-Colonel and Major Straughon: as for Captain Giffin, and several other chief Officers of their party, they came and voluntarily surrendred them∣selves up to Major Generall Lambert, who brought them all with him to the Head quar∣ters at Edinborough. During all which, the approaches against Edinborough Castle, were continued, but to speak the truth, with little or no effect, till the Moneth of December, when as all the Troops which were dispersed up and down the Countrey, were assembled and brought together, by reason of the ill wea∣ther and sharp season, which would not per∣mit them any longer to keep the field, and then they fell to work in earnest towards the reducing of the said Castle, which is the strong∣est and most considerable of all that Countrey, against which a Plat-form was raised to place the Morter-pieces and the great Guns on, but those within relyed so much on the strength and goodnesse of the place, that they hung out a Flagge of defiance; but not long after they were glad to take it in again, whereby it was conceived that the Morter-shells had done some execution, and that thereby they were constrained to change their tune; so that in
lieu of their former Flagge, they were glad to hang out a white one, betokening Peace, and likewise they sent out a Drummer to propound, That they were resolved to yield, if so be they might be permitted to send to the Deputy of the States, which being refused them, they de∣sired to parley, and so delivered up the place. Moreover one of the most remarkable and es∣sential parts of his Highnesse life, was his abi∣lity in making choice of capable personages, fit to serve the State as well by their Councels, as for the managing of the wars, and indeed herein the Parliament alwayes preferred his opinion and sence beyond all others, having found by experience, that his advice and counsells were accompanyed with a good fortune, as his valour constrayned her to Crown his actions. The good successe of the Naval Forces un∣der Gene∣ral Blake.And on the other part, Generall Blake, who commanded the Common-wealths Fleet at Sea, was no lesse successefull by Sea then his late Highnesse was by Land, whose Naval Forces being anchored before Lisbone, having taken several French and Portugal men of war, which much endamaged the English Merchant-men, especially those which traded to the Levant, was obliged by ill weather and for want of pro∣visions, to quit that Coast, and to leave the Port of Lisbone free. During which, Prince Rupert making use of this opportunity, set sail towards Mallaga, where he took, burnt, and pillaged severall English Merchant-men, which obliged Admiral
Blake to reduce his Fleet to seven of his best sailing Frigats, and sending the rest into England with the Prizes which he had taken, he pursued the Enemies with all possible speed & diligence, and being arrived at Mallaga, he understood that they had made sail towards Alicant, and in his search of them, betwixt the Cape of Gat and Paulo, he took a French Ship, which carryed twenty Guns, and presently afterwards the Roe-buck of Prince Ruperts Fleet, after which he encountred with another called the Black Prince, which rather then she would suffer her self to be taken, ran on shore, and fired her powder: Some few dayes after four Vessels more of Prince Ruperts Fleet ran on shoare in the Bay of Carthagena, where they were lost, and deserted by their Ships Companies: Prince Ruperts Fleet rui∣ned.Inso∣much that of all that Fleet, there was but two left, which steered their course toward Major∣ca and Sumaterra. Generall Blake having thus missed them, would no longer continue the pursuit, lest the Common-wealth might need him on more urgent and important occasions, so that he set over for England, to receive the Laurels due to his good service, having done as much as could be expected from a person of Honour and Courage, alwayes faithfull and true to the Common-wealth. He was received by the Parliament with all the prayse and thanks he could expect for his good service, but especially by the Merchants, who treated him highly, and immediately revived the Trade
again, which had for so long time as it were layn dead by the interruptions of so many Ene∣mies. Notwithstanding which good successes the Royallists were not backwark to be stirring in England, being incited thereunto by the Mi∣nisters of the old Church of England, one of their Agents Benson being discovered, was put to death: So likewise in the County of Nor∣folk certain people made a rising, and under the notion of abolishing Papisme, Schismes and Heresies, and of re-establishing the King, they gathered to a head, but the Parliament not give∣ing them time to get into a body, they were routed and defeated, and a score of them were put to death. Much about which time there happened a contest at Constantinople betwixt two English Ambassadors, the one a Royallist, the other a Common-wealths-man, and to know which was the true Ambassador, they referred their businesse to the—who delivered the Royallist into the others power, to dispose of him as he pleased, and in reference thereto he was imbarqued at Smyrna for London, where he was beheaded before the Exchange. But to return to Scotland, where the cold Northern Climate seems to have buryed all the Martial heat, although not the Scotch Ministers zeal, who had excommunicated Straughon and Swinton, for adhering to the English, who per∣formed in those parts as much as the rigour of the season would permit men to doe, and the
Scots on the other side laboured to unite and set∣tle each others mindes and differences, give order for new Levies, and Crowned their King with the greatest magnificence as the indigency and necessity of their affairs would permit. The Scots, who were better accustomed to the ri∣gour and violence of their Winters then the English, thinking to have some advantage over them, would not let slip so favourable a season without their making some good use thereof, wherefore Lievtenant General David Lesly, with a party of 800 Horse endeavoured to sur∣prize Lithgoe, maintained but by one Regiment of Horse, under the Command of Colonel San∣derson, but finding the English upon their guards, were forced to return without any attempt at all: And the English on the other side, to let them see that the harsh season had not quite benummed them, took the field with two Regi∣ments, one of Horse, the other of Foot, com∣manded by Colonel Fenwick, and marched to∣wards the taking of Hume Castle, which was very strong by reason of its situation; I have here inserted two Letters which passed between the Besiegers and the Besieged, by reason that the one denotes an absolute power in the Countrey, and the other bears an extraordi∣nary style.
TO THE GOVERNOUR Of the CASTLE of HUME. SIR, HIs Excellency the Lord General Crom∣well, Hath commanded me to reduce to his Obedience the Castle which you keep; In case you deliver it into my Hands for his Service, it shall be on such Articles which may please you, and those which are with you, by which means you will not a little ease the Neighbouring Countries about you: In case you give me a refusall, I doubt not but by Gods assistance to obtain that which at present I demand of you: I expect your An∣swer to Morrow by seven in the Morning, and remain your Servant FENVVICK.
THE ANSVVER: To the GOVERNOUR of BARWICK, Colonel FENWICK. Right Hourable, I Have seen a Trumpet of yours, as he saith, without a Pass, who doth sum∣mon me to surrender the Castle of Hume to the Lord General Cromwell; That it may not displease you, I never did see nor know your General: as for the Castle of Hume, it is seated on a Rock. Given in the Castle of Hume this day, before seven of the Clock. In these terms I do remain, with∣out prejudice to my Country, your most humble Servant Tho. Cockburne.
BUt the Morter-pieces had no sooner made a slight breach, when as they demanded to parley, and because they would not receive such Conditions as were preferred unto them, they were forced to be contented with such Condi∣tions as they could obtain, and thus they sur∣rendred at discretion. After which, Colonel Monke with about three Regiments of Horse and Foot laid siege to Tymptallon Castle, which for the space of eight and forty hours together, he battered with Morter-pieces without any ef∣fect, whereby he was enforced to raise a Batte∣ry of six Guns, which did marvellous execution, whereupon the besieged desired to parley, but no composition would be given them, so that at last they were constrained to yield to the mercy of the Conquerour, and to deliver into his hand all the Armes, Cannon, Ammunitions of War, and Provisions; The keeping of which Place by the Scots, was a shrewd Thorn in the sides of the English, who were by the parties from the said Castle scituate between Edinbo∣rough and Barwick daily taken and dispoiled, when as they stragled never so little out of their way, which enforced his late Highness to cause this ensuing Declaration to be published, and to have executed with the utmost rigour; Viz.
A DECLARATION By GENERAL CROMWEL. A Decla∣ration for the securi∣ty of the Soldiers.FInding that severall who bear Armes under our Colours, are stript, robbed, and most barbarously and inhumanely murthered by Thieves and Vagabonds, who are not under discipline of any Army; And moreover that the Inhabitants of these Parts, instead of answering our goodness, do joyne with such people and support them; And consi∣dering that it is in the power of the said Inhabitants, to discover and produce them, since they do for the
most part dwell round about those places, where usually the said Villa∣nies are committed; Observing moreover, that by the Intelligence which is given by the Peasants, the said Robbers come forth of their lur∣king places. Therefore I do declare, That in whatsoever place it shal hap∣pen, that any of our Men shall be robbed and dispoiled, or killed by such like persons, I shall require life for life, and an entire restitution for those things which shall be so stoln, upon the Villages, and other places, where the Fact shall have been com∣mitted, unless they discover and pro∣duce the Malefactor: And hereof I will that all men take knowledge, that none may pretend cause of Ig∣norance herein. Given under my Hand and Seal at Edinborough5. No∣vemb. 1656. Signed, O. Cromwell.
BY vertue of this Proclamation severall sums of money were raised on those Parishes and places where the like Robberies and Murthers were committed, and those who were found ei∣ther to be the Authors of, or Complices therein, in any manner whatsoever, were either put to death, or put to a pecuniary Mulct. Shortly after there was a design upon Brunt Island, but at that time it took not any effect; whereas General Cromwell, drew all his Forces out of Edinborough, to have maintained them all the rest of the VVinter in Fyfe, which is the best part of all Scotland, but the rigour of the Season, and the difficulty of the passage constrained him to face about again to his old Quarters, which were very good by reason of the Shipping which con∣tinually arived at Leith with all kind of Provisi∣ons for the Soldiery Horse and Foot; which said Refreshments came in very good time to the Army, which being not accustomed to the extream rigour of the VVeather in those Parts, was incommodated by severall Diseases, and a∣mongst the rest, by a certain contagious Feaver which is peculiar to that Country, and the which had also seised the General himself, who spared his person no more then the least Sol∣dier; His late Highness was so cast down by this kind of Contagion, as that it was believed he would scarce have escaped death: and it may be said that his sickness was the greatest of the whole Armies, for the private Soldiers they
lost no Courage, but did gladly and joyfully withstand and out-brave those difficulties which stopped Julius Caesar in his enterprize in those parts, and who chose rather to be at the charge of a prodigious VVall which fenced him from the Scotch Incursions, then to engage his Army in that mountainous Country, hoary with Snow and Ice, and the Conquest whereof was by the English undertaken in the very heart of the VVinter. And whilst the fierceness of the VVinter is passing over, we will leave both parties in Scot∣land, being seperated by a River, which was im∣possible to be passed over in that Season, and will make a small digression into England, to see what in the mean while passed there. At Oxford, one of the most famous Universities of England, A certain Maiden, who bym if chance at four Months end cast her Fruit, was accused, to have done it wilfully and of set purpose, to have used some art therein; and without any more formalities was Impeached and con∣demned to be hanged, which was accordingly done; and some while afterwards the Physitians and Chirurgions being resolved to make a disse∣ction of her body, there being no Symptomes of life at all in her: Notwithstanding, just as they were ready to cut her up, as if she had been only in a Dream, and as if her shamefac'dness being not able to endure the touching and looks of so many men, had awakened her to shun their Eyes and Rasors, she gave some tokens
of life, to the admiration of the wisest and most judicious men learned in the like Cases, who all of them declared, that she was really dead▪ whereupon no kind of remedies were left unas∣sailed to bring her to herself, which accordingly was accomplished, and she at present liveth in as perfect health as even she did before; It being not Gods will nor pleasure, that during the Government of the justest of Conquerours, there should an act of so high an Injustice pass, as the barbarous condemning and putting to death so innocent a Creature, as the Event pro∣ved this silly Maiden to be. But to come to publick Concernments, the Parliament being desirous together with the Kings person to extirpate his Memory, and to remove those Objects which might beget ten∣derness in the people (who do alwaies bemoan the misfortunes of those whom before they ha∣ted) Commanded that his Statues should be flung down, whereupon that which stood on the VVest-end of St. Pauls Church in London was cast down, and the other which was placed in the old Exchange, placing this following In∣scription in the Comportment above the same; Exit tyrannus Regum ultimus Anno Libertatis Angliae restitutae primo, Anno Domini, 1648. Janu∣arii 30. In like manner the Ames of the Crown of England, which were placed in the Churches, in the Courts of Judiciture, and other publick places, were taken down: And the Common∣weath being now as it seemed solidly establish∣ed,
some neighbouring States who desired to be in Amity with Her, sent their extraordinary Ambassadors over; as namely, the Hollanders, Spain and Portugal, and by the following Nego∣ciations the issues of the said Embassies will ea∣sily appear. As to the Spanish Ambassador, satisfaction was continually demanded of him, for the Mur∣ther which was committed on the persons of this Common-wealths Agents at Madrid, nor was this State at all satisfied with the Answer thereon returned; That the Contestations be∣tween the King of Spain and his Clergy, on that particular were not as yet reconciled or brought to naissue. And as to the Portugal Ambassador, great and vast summes being demanded of him for the reimbursement of those Charges which the King his Master had caused the Common-wealth to be at, and for the reparation of those damages which the English Merchants had su∣stained: He replyed, he had no Orders to make Answer thereunto; whereupon he had his Au∣dience of departure, and went his way. Immediatly after, this Common-wealth sent two extraordinary Ambassadors to the States of the united Provinces, the Lords Oliver St. Johns, and Walter Strickland, Personages of a high re∣pute, and endowed with exquisite Parts; their Train was great ad splendid, and their Equipage favoured not a little of the Splendor of their continued Victories: They Embarqued in the Downs on the eleventh of March, 1651. and the
next day toward even they came to an anchor neer Helvoot Slugs, but not without some dan∣ger, on the 13 they made towards Rotterdam in the long-boats, and by the way they were met by some of the States Jachts or Barges, and being arrived they were by the English Mer∣chants conducted to their publick House, where they were most splendidly entertained; whither the Spanish Ambassador sent to com∣plement them, by one of his Gentlemen, to testifie unto them his joy for their happy arri∣val, beseeching them to enter into and joyn with him in a right understanding. Two or three dayes after, they set forward towards the Hague, and by the way were met by the Master of Ceremonies, accompanyed with about thirty Coaches, and after some reciprocal com∣plements passed and exchanged, they were con∣ducted to a stately House which was prepared for them in the Town, where having been three dayes treated at the States charges, they had audience. In which the Lord St. Johns made a most Elegant and learned Speech, in English, and gave the Copy thereof unto the Lords States both in English and in Dutch, the most essential points whereof were as fol∣loweth.
I. That they were sent unto the Lords, the High and mighty States of the United Provinces, on the behalf of the Parliament of the Common-wealth of England, to ciment a firm League and Confederation betwixt the two Common-wealths, in case their Lordships thought it fitting, notwithstanding the inju∣ries which the English had received from the Holland Nation. II. That they desired to renew and con∣firm the Treaties and Agreements formerly made, concerning the Traffique and Com∣merce betwixt both Nations. III. After which they exhibited the advantages which the Hollanders would reap by this said union, in regard of the commodious situation of England, for the Traffique, with the multitude and security of her Havens, and of all things which may advance the Commerce and Trade. IV. Finally he told them, That he wus commanded by the Parliament of England and by the Common-wealth, to make known
to their Lordships, how sencibly they were touched with the Murder which was com∣mitted on the person of their Agent, Mr. Dorislaus, and that they doubted not but their Lordships would use all possible en∣deavours to discover the Authors of that horrid and unworthy action. After which, the Lords States being infor∣med, that the said Lords Ambassadors follow∣ers were daily molested and affronted by the English Royallists, and other persons, who re∣sided in Holland, they caused a Proclamation to be drawn up, which they sent unto the Lords Ambassadors, to know of them whether it was penned in the due terms, according to their good liking, whereby on pain of death they prohibited, that no man should either by words or deeds, offend or molest any of the said Am∣bassadors followers or retainers. Three months time was already elapsed in their Negotiation at a vast expense, and with a farre greater pa∣tience, without that the least satisfaction in the world could be obtained at the hands of Justice, for those daily affronts & injuries which were put upon the Lords Ambassadors Retinue & Servants, and the scorns and disgraces offered to their own persons, even to such a pitch, as that the Common people and Rascality would assem∣ble themselves at the Gates of their house, and belch out injurious language, and set upon, and
injure their Servants. Now the Parliament being sensible of these wrongs and injuries, and seeing the Lords States did not at all answer those kinde proffers and endeavours which were made unto them, to beget and fettle a solid and firm alliance and peace betwixt the two Com∣mon-wealths, save with delayes and shifts, purposely to gain time upon the English, till they should be able to judge how the face of things would evidence it self in Scotland, and which way the Chain would turn there, they recalled their Ambassadors. Which suddain and unexpected newes ex∣treamly surprised the Hollanders, who testified their astonishments thereon to the Lords Am∣bassadors, by more frequent and oftner visita∣tions then formerly, and by which they endea∣voured to perswade them to beleeve the since∣rity of their intentions, and how earnestly and ardently they desired the alliance which their Lordships had propounded. But all these fair words were not able to stay the Ambassadors, who immediately returned into England again, to cut out another guesse kinde of work for the Hollanders. And that which gave the greater cause of jealousie unto the English, and made them believe that the Hollander dealt deceit∣fully with them, was that their Admirall Van Trump lay lurking about the Isle of of Scillie, with his Fleet, as if he had some design to make himself Master of them: But when as the States were demanded the reason of his
lying there, they replyed, that their Admirals being in those parts was only to demand resti∣tution of some Ships, Goods and Merchandises which the Pyrats of those parts had despoiled their Merchants of: Which answer though in some measure it satisfied the Parliament, yet not so farre as to trust too much therein to the Hollanders, and whereby the Parliament was obliged to give order for the suddain reducing of that Island to their obedience. The re∣ducing the Isle of Scilly.Generall Blake being re-inforced by a Squa∣dron of Ships commanded by Sir George Askue which was designed for the reduceing of the Cariba Islands made sail towards Scilly, where immediately they set ashoar 300. Sea-men, be∣sides the Land-men, the Sea-men gave the first onset with a great deal of courage and resolu∣tion, and the Land-men did second them very well, insomuch that they speedily became Masters of the Isles of Tresco and Bryers, where they took 150 Prisoners, after they had once slain a score of them. They found in the place two good Frigats, one of 18 Guns and the o∣ther of 32. and immediately possessed the best Haven of all these Islands, whence the Ene∣mies fled unto St. Maries, the strongest of all those Islands, but which held not long out af∣terwards, and so they were all reduced. It is unnecessary to lose time in the disating upon the strength and conveniencies of those Islands, since all what art and nature could possibly al∣lotte unto them, is there to be found, and so
need but look into the Mappes, to judge by their very situation, of what concernment they are unto England. Meanwhile it is worthy ad∣miration that so difficult a Conquest should be attained in so little a space of time, with the losse of so few men onely. And whereas the Royallists did continue to make good Cornet Castle in the Isle of Guernsey, and on a false advise, that there were but forty men in the place, eighteen of which were also said to be incapable of doing service, a resolution was taken to set upon the said Castle, and to carry it by surprisall; but when the attempt was made, there were found to be in the place threescore good men, who when the Scaleing Ladders were applyed to the walls, and the assault given to the place, defended themselves resolutely, and endammaged the Assailants in such a manner, with Stones and Timber which they cast down upon them, as also by their Canon which flanked the wall, charged with Case-shot, as that they killed divers of the Assailants, and constrayned the rest to retire, and the greatest dysaster that hapned, was, that a Vessel or two in which the men retired, were sunk by the Canon from the Castle: And however this attempt did not succeed, yet the English did like couragious men, and deserved no lesse prayse then if they had carryed the place. About which time, one Brown-Bushell was beheaded at London, a famous Royallist both by Sea and Land, for having deserted the Parliaments Forces, and having since com∣mitted
several Murders and mischievous acti∣ons. But it is time to return into Scotland, and to see in what posture both Armies are there. The English, who would not remain idle, only to keep their Men in action, besieged Blackness, a considerable place, and whence their quarters were continually allarum'd by the Mosse-Troopers, who retreated and sheltred them∣selves in that place. Blacknsse taken by Coloel Monk.Colonel Monk comman∣ded in chief in this Expedition, who with but a handfull of men, causing a Battery to be rais∣ed, and having given them some few volleys of Cannon, constrained them to yield. The Scots unit.On the other side, all the several dissenting parties amongst the Scots, notwithstanding their diffe∣rences, quarrels, jealousies, and their terrible excommunications, did unite themselves al∣together, by their common interest, wherein they concurred to re-establish their King, whereunto they were encouraged by severall under hand practises which were carried on here in England, and chiefly in Lancashire, which was generally to have risen in Arms: A Plot discovered.One of the chief Agents interessed in this busi∣nesse, by name Mr. Thomas Cook, was taken at London, who discovered part of the design, and more was known by Letters which were found in a Vessel sailing from the Mount of Scotland to the Isle of Man, which belonged to the Earl of Darby, and who anon will appear more vi∣sibly in this businesse, as also Mr. Birkenhead
was taken, being charged with severall Orders and Instructions by which the most hidden and intricate secrets of this conspiracy were disco∣vered. Major Ge∣neral Har∣rison sent to the North.These proceedings obliged the Parlia∣ment to order a party both of Horse and Foot under the command of Major General Harri∣son, to march towards the North, as well to dissipate such raisings as should chance to hap∣pen there, as to oppose the Enemy, should they make an irruption by the way of Carlisle. Meanwhile, several persons of note were im∣peached, and tryed for having a hand in this Conspiracy: Mr. Love & Gibbons beheaded.The names of the chief are as followeth, viz. Mr. Christopher Love, Major Alford, Major Addams, Colonel Barton, Mr. Blackmore, Mr. Case, and Mr. Cauton, Doctor Drake, Mr. Drake, Captain Farre, Mr. Gibbons, Mr. Haviland, and Mr. Jenkins, Major Hunting∣ton, Mr. Jackwell, Mr. Jackeson, Mr. Walton, Mr. Robinson, Captain Massey, Captain Potter, Lieutenant Colonels, Jackeson, Sowton, and Vaughan, and several others. Two of which number were only put to death, being found more guilty then the rest, to wit, Mr. Love and Mr. Gibbons, who were both beheaded on Tower-hill. And a false re∣port being spread in the principality of Wales, that Generall Cromwell was defeated in Scot∣land, and that the Royallists Army was entring England, a party began to form it self in those parts, but as the cause of the same rising was false, so the effect thereof did soon vanish.
Now the English being resolved to termi∣nate the warre of Scotland, caused Vessels to be built, to passe over the River, and to enter into Fife, which began to allarum the Enemies who were on the other side of the water, as also those in Brunts-Island. Nor were the Scots idle neither, but incommodated those quarters of the English which were the most advanced, which they effected with the greater advantage, being versed and known in the wayes and advan∣ces, and by this means they slew several Eng∣lish Souldiers as they went out to forrage and to get in Provisions, whereby the English were constrained to quit their Out-quarters, and ha∣ving thus ingrossed their Army by the said Gar∣risons, they advanced towards Fife, and to that end made their Magazine at Blacknesse, but not finding wherewithall in the Countrey to feed their Horse, they retarded their March for some few dayes: The Scotch army com∣pleated re∣fuse to fight.By which time the Scots ha∣ving compleated their Levies, found them∣selves to be 15000 Foot, and 6000 Horse, with which Force they marched toward a place call∣ed Torwood on this side Sterling, whereby they were faced by the English Army, but would not ingage in a Battail, keeping themselves with∣in their Bogges, and other inaccessable places, Colonel Overton passes into Fife.whereupon the English resolved to passe over part of their Army on the other side of the River, and Colonel Overton being thereunto ordered, did on the 6th of July, 1651. passe at Queens Ferry with 1600 Foot, and four
Troops of Horse, having in his said passage lost but six men; as soon as they were arrived they fell to intrenching themselves, and at the same time, the Generall with the body of the Army marched directly towards the Enemy, to the end, that in case the Scots should make a shew to march towards Fife, he might charge their Rear, before they should gain Sterling, and the Scots being unwilling to let the day passe without driving the English out of Fife, sent 4000 Horse and Foot, under the command of Sir John Brown, to set upon the English, which obliged Generall Cromwell to send over a re-in∣forcement of two Regiments of Horse, and two Regiments of Foot, under the Command of Major Generall Lambert,Major Ge∣neral Lam∣bert passes into Fife. in lesse then 24 hours they were passed over and joyned to the others, and immediately the Regiment of Co∣lonel Okey advanced towards the Enemy, which ingaged them to draw up into Battel-array, and the English likewise did the same, who though they were more in number then the Scots, yet they had the advantage of the ground, and the Scots being placed on a hill, they re∣mained face to face for the space of an hour and a half, looking on each other, the Scots not being willing to march down nor lose their advantage, insomuch that the English at last re∣solved to march up towards them, and set upon them so resolutely, as that after a very slender contest they quite routed them, and made such a butchery amongst them, that they killed
2000 of their 4000 took 1400 Prisoners,4000 Scots defeated by the English. a∣mongst whom Sir John Brown who commanded the Party, Colonel Buchanam, and severall o∣ther persons of quality on the English side, there were but few slain, but many hurt; and in refe∣rence hereunto more Forces were sent over into Fyfe, in case the whole Body of both Armies might chance to come to a generall Battell. Immediatly after the English became Masters of Inchigarvy a strong Castle, scituate upon a Rock in the midst of the Province of Fryth, be∣tween Queens Ferry and North Ferry, in which there were sixteen piece of Ordnance mounted. Brunt Isle∣land sur∣rendred. On the twenty seventh of July, all the English Army appearing before Brunt Island, the Go∣vernour there of took such an Alarme thereat, as that after a small Contest in a Parley, he surren∣dred the same, delivering unto the English, to∣gether with the said Island, all the Men of War which were found in the Haven, all the Cannon of the place, as also all the Armes, Ammu∣nition of War, and the provision of Victuals; which said Isle was very considerable for the English to make a Magazine and Storehouse for the Provisions and Ammunition for the Army. St. Johns Town surren∣dred.Thence the Army marched to St. John's Town, a very strong and considerable place, in∣to which the Enemy had but just before put a fresh Regiment, who were resolved to have de∣fended themselves very well, but as soon as they saw that their Sluces were cut off by the English, they lost their Courage, and surrendred the place,
The Scots enter Eng∣land by Carlisle.Meanwhile there happened a great change of Affairs, for the Scots Army consisting in 16000 men, abandoned their own Territories, in hopes of establishing themselves in a better Country, and by the way of Carlisle enter England. The Eng∣lish followGeneral Cromwell being advertised hereof, issued out immediatly such Orders as were re∣quisite to pursue the Scots, and with all possible speed the Army repassed the River of Fife upon a Bridge of Boats at Leith, Major General Lambert the sooner to overtake the Enemies Rear, with 3000 Horse and Dragoons followed after them, and Major General Harrison with a Body of lighter Horse, was commanded to get into the Van of the Enemy, for to amuse and detain them, whilst the General himself with the Body of the Army consisting in sixteen Regiments of Horse and Foot immediatly pur∣sued the Enemy. Colonel Monk with 7000 men reduceth all ScotlandBut not wholly to abandon the Affaires of Scotland; Colonel Monk was left there with 7000 men, with which alone he perfected the Conquest of that Kingdome, taking immediatly after this Change of the Scene, the strong Town and Castle of Sterling, being a very considerable Place, and also Aberdeen, Dundee, and the strong Castle of Dunnotters, and Dunbarton, with many others: Insomuch, as that after the pas∣sage into Fyfe was once gained, the remaining parts of Scotland were so on entirely subdued, and were made tributary unto the Common-wealth of England.
Mean while, the divided Parties of the English Forces which pursued the Scots Army, did quite and clean tire them out during their March, set∣ting upon them sometimes in the Van, some∣times in the Rear, sometimes in the Flank; and finally, on all sides as they saw their oportunity to disturb and annoy them: Insomuch that their long and precipitated March did much weaken the Scots. But that which troubled and vexed them most of all, was the little hopes they saw of those promises of relief which were given them from England, The Parliament having settled such good Orders in all parts, as that no body durst stir or rise in Armes to their Aide. In all places wheresoever the Scots came they proclaimed their King, To be King of great Britain, France, and Ireland, according to the accustomed Formes, and in his Name they sent unto all those who had any Commands, or were in any Authority in those parts through which they passed, to rise in Armes joyntly with them, but no body budged. To the contrary by Or∣der of Parliament the Trained Bands of severall Countries drew forth in Armes, to hinder the Risings, and to augment the Common-wealths Armies. On the one side, General Cromwells Army marched on the Heels of the Scots to their Terrour; on the other side, the Major Ge∣neral Lambert and Harrison waited upon their Designs, and Colonel Robert Lilborn was left in Lancashire, to hinder the Earl of Darby from levying men in those parts, and to the same
purpose, severall other Bodies were placed in other places, as the occasion required, both to cut off the Enemies Provisions, as well as his passage; In case they should resolve to retreat back again, or to fly away. Finally, the Scotch Army having reached the Town of Worcester, pitched its Camp there, having much debated where, and in what manner they should fix upon a resting and breathing place, after so long and tedious a march: Whereof the Earl of Darby was no sooner assertained, but he issued forth of his Island with 300 Gentlemen, and Landed in Lancashire, where he assembled at least 1200 men, during which, the Generals Regiment which was left at Manchester, was Commanded to joyn with Colonel Lilborne, to cut off the Earl of Darbies passage to Manchester, whither he was marching to have faln upon the said Re∣giment; but Colonel Lilborne observing his motion, marched the very same way, joyning Flank and Flank, with the Earls Forces, who deeming that he ought not to defer the Fight with Lilborne, till he should have joyned with the Generals Regiment, when as then he might have proved too strong, but whilst he was weaker being alone, fell upon Colonel Lilborne, and each side for the space of four hours fight did be∣have themselves very well, The Earle of Darby defeated.till at length the Earls Forces being worsted, he was constrained to save himself, and to gain Worcester, almost all alone; amongst Prisoners of note, which were taken in this Encounter, were Colonel Legg,
Robinson, Baines, Gerrard, four Livetenant Colo∣nels, one Major, four Captains, two Livetenants, twenty Gentlemen, and five hundred Soldiers. There were killed the Lord Withrinton, Sir Tho∣mas Fieldsley, Colonel Boynton, Sir William Throg∣morton, Sir Gamuell, and sixty Soldi∣ers. On the Parliaments side there were but ten men slain, but abundance were hurt, which de∣feat, although it was but a small one, yet it was very ominous, and served not a little to discou∣rage those who were on the Brink of declining themselves, and ready to rise in Armes; so that it may be said without vanity, that the de∣feating of those 1500 men, hindred above 10000 to joyn with the Scots at Worcester: and indeed Colonel Lilborne received those Ho∣nours and that recompense from the Parliament which was due to his Valour; And the Lord General Cromwell whose prudence did at all times equallize his Valour, nay far surpass it, being conscious that diligence and expedition was more then requisite in this Conjuncture, which was like unto a Gangren, continually gaining ground, and therefore immediatly to be cut off, least it should endanger the whole; a∣rived with his Army at Worcester, sooner then he was expected, with a resolution to make his E∣nemies either perish within the place, or con∣strain them to give Battel. Here War-like stra∣tagems or wiles were not necessary, for there was no delaying of the business, neither was
there any retreat to be made, or flight to be ta∣ken; It matters not for one Town more or less, This is the upshot Blow, where the best Swords were, to decide the Interest of three Crowns. The Royallists were backed by dispaire, and the others were animated with the continuall and accustomed defeating of their Enemies; Now both must either fight or die, and resolve to be a Cast or nothing, and the Town of Worcester, this very day must be the bloody Theater, of the fairest chance of Fortune which ever happened in the Isles of great Britain; The first thing therefore which the Parliaments Forces endea∣voured, was to gain a pass over the River of Se∣verne, which was immediatly performed by Major General Lambert, at a place called Ʋpton, and which passage was made good by Liveten at General Fleetwcods Brigade, which advancing towards Tame River, a Bridge of Boats was laid over the same, and likewise another Birdge was made over Severn on the Generals side, which being perceived by the Royallists they caused a Body both of Horse and Foot to advance to op∣pose the Livetenant Generals passage, Worcester Fight.who was backed by two Regiments of Foot of Colonel Inglesbies, and Colonel Fairfax's, by the Ge∣nerals Troops of Guard, and Clonel Hackers Regiment of Horse, all which were animated and encouraged by the Generals prerence, who marched at the Head of them; after which Co∣lonel Goff's, and Major General Deans Regi∣ments were passed over the River, who began
to scoure the Hedges which were lined by the Enemy, and whence they drave them away, beating them from Hedge to Hedge, being sup∣plyed with fresh men, but after this kind of Skir∣mish had lasted well nigh a good hour, very smartly, the Royallists were constrained to give ground, and to retire to Powick Bridge, which they made good for an hour longer, but quitting it at length, they retired toward the Town, ex∣cept those which were made Prisoners; and within a little while afterwards, having assem∣bled all their Forces, and all their Courage to boot, they issued forth of the Town in a Body towards the Generals side, believing that the best part of his Army had been on the other side (as in effect it was seperated in two by the a∣fore specified River, and the Royallists at their first charge were so furious and resolute, as that the Generals Troops were constrained to give way, but that only served to augment their cou∣rage, and make them more covetous of Glory: Insomuch, that renewing their Fight with a fresh vigour, they charged the Enemy so impetuous∣ly, as that the Scotch Army both Horse and Foot were on a suddain over borne and quite brought into disorder, all their Works and Lynes, toge∣ther with their Royall Fort, and their Cannon were immediatly taken, and turned upon and a∣gainst themselves; the Town was given in Pil∣lage, The Scots defeated at Worce∣ster.and all their Foot were either slain or ta∣ken Prisoners, a Body of 3000 Horse brake through and made their escape, and one thou∣sand
of them were taken by Colonel Barton who lay about Bewdly, only with a few Horse and Dragoons, and Colonel Lilborne with the Ge∣nerals Regiments of Foot accidentally met with the Earl of Darby, who a little before had escaped him, whom he seized, together with the Earl of Landerdale,, and above a hundred persons of quality, severall others were like∣wise taken by the other parties which were a∣broad; as Duke Hamilton General of the Scotch Army, who afterwards died of his Wounds, the Earl of Rothe, the Earl of Cornwarth, the Earle of Shrewsbury, Packington, Cunningham, and Clare, Knights, the Lords Spine and Sinclere, the Earle of Cleaveland, of Kelley, and Colonel Greaves, six Colonels of Horse, thirteen of Foot, nine Livetenant Colonels of Horse, eight of Foot, six Majors of Horse, thirteen of Foot, thrity se∣ven Captains of Horse, seventy three of Foot, fifty five Quarter-masters, eighty nine Livete∣nants of Foot, Major Generall Biscotty, Major General Montgomery, the Livetenant General of the Ordnance, the adjutant General of the Foot, the Martiall General, the Quarter-master General, the Conductor General of the Bag∣gage, seventy six Standards, ninety nine Ensigns, nine Ministers, nine Chirurgions, one hundred fifty eight Colours, and all the Cannon, and Baggage generally, the Royall Standard, the Kings Coach and Horses, the Royall Robe, the Collar of the Order of the Garter, thirty of his domestick Servants, and his Secretary Fashams
as for the King his own person, he made and es∣cape strangely, and in a disguise he saved himself at length into France, not without many diffi∣culties and dangers; Notwithstanding the Par∣liament had promised five hundred pounds to any one that could discover his Person. Several other persons were also afterwards taken in the remotest Countries; as Major General Massey, who afterwards made an escape, Major General Middleton, Livetenant General David Lesly, and severall others; insomuch, as that it may be said, the Gleanings of this Victory, were as conside∣rable as the whole Harvest it self. But let us return to our CONQUEROR, and observe with what a moderation he enjoyed this his victory, he desires no triumphall prepa∣rations, He would not that thanks should be re∣turned to him for the same; but only to God alone, who helped him with his mighty Arme to advance his own Glory, and to establish the peace and repose of England, upon solid and firm Foundations, and when as the Parliament did propound unto him most splendid and mag∣nificent Presents, in recompense, he only desi∣red the Lives and Liberties of their Prisoners. They proposed to have Bonefires made, and to have Triumphall Arcks erected, but he answer∣ed; That it would be better to raise Monuments to such of their Illustrious Patriots as lost their lives in the gaining of that Day, and to bewaile their deaths with Teats. And Iastly at the Ge∣nerals request; there were onely the Earle of
Darby, and Sir Fetherston Knight, of all this great number of Prisoners put to death. besides some few others of less quality. The re∣maining Nobility of Scotland seised and sent into England.Much about which time also, that smal Body of an Army which remained in Scotland, seized upon a great number of the Nobility of the Country, who were assembled all together at a place called Ellet; where the old General Lesly, Earle Marshall, the Lord Keith, Cofford, Ogleby, Barany, Huntly, Lee, and severall other Knights, Gentlemen, and Ministers, were in Consulta∣tion, all of which were put on boord a Ship, and sent into England. This great Storm being thus over-blown, and the Minds of the Parliament Members being calmed, after the apprehensions of the Scotch Invasion, and the doubtfull and unexpected E∣vents of a Battel, they began to track the Foot-steps of their Conquest a new, and the whole Common-wealth being entirely cleansed with∣in, they cast about how to reduce those Islands which sheltred several of the Enemies smal Ves∣ssels, whereby the Trade was interrupted, and several Merchant-men impeded in their Voya∣ges: The Isle of Jersey attemptedThe Isle of Jersey was the first they resolved to begin withall, and the Conduct of this En∣terprise was left to Colonel Haymes, who upon the same accompt on the fourteenth of October, 1651. caused two Regiments of Foot, and as ma∣ny of Horse to be embarqued on board of eight Ships, in the Port of Weymouth, and the seven∣teenth they set Saile, but the Stormy Weather
forced them to return: On the nineteenth they set saile again, and on the same day about Mid∣night, they came to anchor under the Island of Zoark, and next Morning continuing their Course, they arived at Stowens Bay in Jersey; on the next day they fell down with the Tyde, and got into St. Brelads Bay, where they were assai∣led by so vehement a storm as that the Fleet was dispersed, but having joyned to each other again; on the one and twentieth they resolved to go ashoare that Night at Stowens Bay, whe∣unto they were necessitated for want of Forrage for the Horse, and as it were in a trice, they landed their Horse by an admirable Industry of General Blake, and his other Officers in Boats, and two hours after the Flood they weighed anchor, and some cut their Cables to run a shoare, and so the Foot Landed some at three some at four, some at five, and some at six foot set and more, receiving all that while both the Cannon and Musket shot which played upon them from the shoare; Notwithstanding which they gained Land, although they were faced by both the Horse and Foot of the Island, but this was their advantage, they were so over-charged with Water, as that they were not succeptible of Fire. Finally, after they had endured this first brunt, they got all of them on shoare, and quickly gained as much Ground as served them to draw up into a Body to fight, which they ac∣cordingly did, with so much resoluion and vi∣gour, that in one half houres time they forced
the Enemy to retreat, who left their Ensignes behind them, and twelve piece of Cannon, af∣ter which the Horse being a little heartned ha∣ving been refreshed in their Quarters in the Island, on the two and twentieth of October they attempted three small Forts, each having two piece of Ordnance in them which they took, af∣ter which, they advanced within sight of Eliza∣beths Castle, to set upon a Fort called the Tow∣er of St. Albons, having fourteen piece of Ord∣nance commanded by the said Castle: In two hours time they gained the said Tower, and their next work was to possess the Castle of Montorqueil, which they also took without much trouble; Jersey and all the Castles ta∣ken.But Elizabeths Castle being a very strong and considerable place into which they had retired all rheir Forces, was not sur∣rendred untill the midst of the Month of De∣cember, on the most advantagious Conditions which so considerable a place could expect. On the sixteenth of October 1651. there were embarqued at Westchester and Leverpoole three Regiments of Foot, to wit, The Isle of Man at∣tempted, and redu∣ced.General Cromwells, commanded by Livetenant Colonel Worstey, Ma∣jor General Deanes Commanded by Livetenant Colonel Michell, and Colonel Ducknfields, who Commanded the whole Brigade, together with two Troops of Horse, which Forces were sent to reduce the Isle of Man. On the eighteenth of the said Month they set Sail, but the VVind coming contrary, they were driven into the Port of Beaumorris. On the
twenty fifth, by two in the Morning the Wind coming Southwardly, by the favour of a fresh Gale, they set Sail again, and about two of the Clock in the Afternoon they discovered the Custle of the Isle of Man, Rushen Castle, Darby Fort, and a good part of the Island, as also the Inhabitants and Soldiery, as well Horse and Foot in Armes, who were drawn out to make a review of their Forces, when as by a suddain Gust the Fleet was hindred from approaching neerer the shoare, whereupon they tacked about towards the North of the Island, and not with∣out some difficulty they gained Ramsey Bay, where they Anchored that Night in sight of the Island, and sent them Volleys of Cannon which were not at all answered by those of the Island. On the twenty sixth of October, an In∣habitant was sent on board the Fleet from the chief persons of the Island, to assure the Com∣mander that they would not in any wise hinder their Landing, But to the contrary that they would deliver up unto them two Forts which they had Mastered, after which there remained only Rushen and Peele Castle to be taken, where∣in they would also be assisting to the utmost of their powers: But because the said Inhabitant brought nothing in writing to confirm what he had said, Major Fox went on shoare to be assu∣red of the certainty thereof, and returning well satisfied, he was followed by some Commissio∣ners of the Island, who most humbly beseeched the Officers not to ruine them, which must of
necessity ensue, should they Land all their Men, obliging and engaging themselves to bring Pro∣visions at reasonable rates, unto those who should remain on board the Ships: The Com∣mander in chief returned them thanks, promi∣sing them to do them all the favour possible and imaginable; but it fell out unhappily for all sides: That on the twenty seventh the Sea be∣came very rough, and the Ships being not able to remain all of them under shelter in the said Bay, they were in a great deale of darger, and one Ship running a shoare, was broken and rent in sunder; however all the men were saved, and those within the Castles knowing full well the danger wherein the Ships were, did encrease the dangers from shoare as well as from Sea, and thereby became the more resolute and obsti∣nate; Insomuch that on the twenty eighth they were constrained to Land the Horse and the rest of the Foot; who became Masters of the Forts, and afterwards set upon the Castles, in one of which was the Earle of Darbies Widow, who quickly surrendred herself, together with all the Ammunitions of War, and some Vessells which were Anchored in the Harbour. Guernsy Castle sur∣rendred.And not long after the strong Castle of Guern∣sey was also surrendred to the Parliament, the whole Island having alwaies remained under the obedience of the Common-wealth, and never deserted the same. And, as there is no felicity or bliss under the Heavens, which is not mingled with some bit∣terness;
The death of two fa∣mous Per∣sons in England.so in like manner, the great Conquest of the Parliament both by Sea and Land, had some mixture of missorrunes on both Elements, on the Land by the decease of a great Captaine, and a greater States-man, and on the Sea by the death of a great Pilot, and a greater Admirall both together. The first was the Lord Ireton, Son-in-law to his late Highness, who immediat∣ly after the taking of Limrick, a very conside∣rable place in those parts, died, during his being Lord Deputy of Ireland, he was generally be∣moaned of all men, being a person who had rendred himself equally famous in War-like Ex∣ploits, as well as in Politick Affairs, and Sagaci∣ous Councels, and to speak the truth, there was scarce his like in all England, and all the Com∣forts which survived his loss, were, that those good Foundations which he had laid, and the Maximes which he had prescribed for the Go∣vernment of Ireland did not perish with him, but have remained to his Successors, as Lamps and Lights whereby they may safely conduct their Foot-steps, and assuredly carry on their De∣signes. The other famous Person who also dyed, was General Poppham, a Personage endowed with all the good qualities of an exquisite Sea-man, being valiant, active, and well versed in Sea Af∣faires, his precipitated death, and the small time he continued in that Imployment, did shew un∣to us less what he was, then according unto all appearance what he would have been, had it
pleased God to have lengthned his daies. And now the Parliament being truly sencible both of the old and new Injuries which England had received from, and by the States of Holland, thought it fit to publish this ensuing Manifest; Viz. An Act of Parlia∣ment, con∣cerning the Impor∣tation and exportati∣on of Goods & Merchan∣dises.THat no Commodities whatsoever of the growth or Manifacture of Africa, Asia, A∣merica, or Europe, should be brought into Eng∣land, or into any of the Territories belonging thereunto, either by the English themselves, or by any others, save in Vessels, or Barques, effe∣ctively belonging to this Common-wealth, or the Collonies and Plantations in the Indies, who depend on the same, on the penalty of for∣feiting both Ships and Goods. 2. That all Commodities whatsoever of the growth or manifacture of Forreigners which shall be brought within the Dominions of this Common-wealth, in Vessels belonging to the Inhabitants thereof shall be taken and laden only in the places where the said wares do grow or else in those Ports and Havens, whence they must of necessity be brought, and where they are accustomed to be had and bought at the first hand. 3. That all kind of Fish of the Fish∣ing belonging to the people of this Nati∣on, as also all kind of Oyle of Fish, VVhales
Oyle, and VVhale Bones, shall not be brought, save in such Ships where the said Fishing shall have been made, upon the forementioned Pe∣nalty. 4. That after the first of February, 1653. there shall be no Salt-fish transported out of England, save in English Vessels, &c. Then which, no∣thing was more pleasing to the Merchants, nor could any thing have more eucouraged them, to cause the Traffick and Navigation to flourish a∣gain, and whereby they were not a little also en∣deared to the Parliaments Interest: So likewise was it very effectual to gain the Seamens hearts, then which nothing is so apt to rebell, and so hard to be kept in awe. So likewise severall other Ordinances and Regulations were made concerning those Mer∣chandizes which are brought from the East In∣dies, from the Levant, and from the Coast of Spain and Portugal,A Rup∣ture with Holland caused. all which did not much please, and but lease oblige the Hollanders; but to the contrary did so exasperate their Minds, as that even during the time when they were treat∣ing of an Accommodation, it came to an open VVar, concerning the point of Honour at Sea, and in this wise the Quarrel begun. The first Sea-fight with the Hollander, May 52.MAjor Bourn Commander in chief of a Squadron of English Ships, discovered Van Trump Admirall of the Dutch Fleet, on the back of Goodwine Sands, who with two and forty
Saile of Ships made towards Dover Road, where∣upon the Frigat called the Greyhound was com∣manded to make all the possible saile she could after them, to speak with them, which she ac∣cordingly did, whereas they struck their Saile, and gave all kind of tokens of honour and respect, saying moreover, That they would gladly tell something in the behalf of their Ad∣miral, unto the Party that commanded the En∣glish Fleet in chief, and coming on board, they saluted the English Ships, and to seem the more officious, they gave them an Account of their Navigation in this wise; saying, That the No∣thernly VVinds having been somewhat high for some daies, they had been constrained to ply more to the Southward, then else they willing∣ly would have done, and that being come to an Anchor somewhat hitherwards, to avoid the fal∣ling too neer unto Dunkirk, they had lost seve∣rall Cables and Anchors, concluding that they had not the least intention to do us any Injury. General Blake was at that time with the rest of the Fleet towards the VVest, who being en∣formed by Major Bourn of the Hollanders pro∣ceedings, he used all the possible speed he could to joyne with him, and on the nineteenth of May he discovered the Hollanders Anchored in Dover Road, and being within three Leagues of each other, the Hollander weighed Anchor, and sailed Eastward, where they met with an Ex∣press from the States, whom they spake withall, and afterwards made all the Saile they could up
to the English Fleet, their Admiral Van Trump shewing himself upon the Decks of the fore∣most Ships; And General Blake coveting the honour to give the first Volley, let fly three Guns at Van Trumps Flag, though without Bul∣lets, To which Van Trump answered by a shot from the Stern of his Ship backwards, signifying his disdain to vale his Flag, and instead of the striking his Main Top-saile, he caused a red Flag of War to be set up, in token of a Combat to his whole Fleet, and without any further de∣lay, he gave General Blake a whole Broad-side, who joyfully received it, and returned two for one, and for the space of foure houres together both Fleets fought with that Animosity and ve∣hemency, which is usually on the like occasions at the first fallings out: when at last, having se∣verall times past and repast, through and through each other, General Blake obtained the Victory, having sunk one Holland Man of War, took another with thirty Guns made a hundred and fifty Prisoners, and both the Captains of the said Ships, and sent the rest of their Fleet home by weeping Cross, to tell the rest of their But∣ter-box Brethren the success of their rash At∣tempt: The English lost but ten Men in this Fight, and had forty wounded, and of the whole Fleet, the Generals Ship alone was some∣what endamaged in her Masts, Sails, Tackling, and Apparel; After which the States of Holland disowned and disavowed this Action, and to that purpose sent over two extraordinary Ambas∣sadors
into England, who represented these Reasons to the Parliament of England, therein declaring, Viz. That the unhappy Fight betwixt the Fleets of both Common-wealths, hapned without their knowledge, and contrary to the will and desire of the Lords, the States General of the united Provinces, taking God to witness of this Truth, who knows the hearts of men, and that both by Letters and Messages they had con∣tinually been assured of the said Lords and States Sincerity: That with astonishment and amazement they had received the fatall tydings of so rash an Attempt and Action; and that im∣mediatly they entred into Consultation, how they might best find out a remedy to soften and excuse this fresh bleeding Wound: To which end they had convocated a general Assembly of the Provinces, in the which they doubted not, God willing, to meet with a present remedy to these Troubles, whereby not only the Causes of all the evils which might ensue, should be removed, but also by an interiour Comfort mens Minds might be rectified, and brought to a better hope of the Treaty which was on Foot, wherein their Lordships laboured daily, and in good earnest for the Welfare of both Nations, to avoid the further effusion of Christian blood, so much desired by the Enemies unto both Na∣tions; wherefore they requested and desired most humbly of this honourable Councel by the Pledges of the Liberty and their mutuall con∣currence
in Religion; Not to suffer any thing to be undertaken with too much precipi∣tation and heat, which might at length become irrevocable, and not to be remedied by vaine Wishes, or too late Vows; but that without delay they might receive a favourable Answer, which they the more earnestly desire, since their Lordships, the States Ships, and Marriners were detained and impeded in their Voyages, some by force and others by the Fights at Sea, and the rest in the Ports of this Common-Wealth. Whereunto the Parliament thus replyed, Viz. THat whereas they remember with what continual Demonstrations of Friendship they alwaies Comported themselves towards their Neighbours of the united Provinces, ever since the beginning of their Civil Wars, having not omitted any thing which might tend to the preservation of a good understanding betwixt them, they think it very strange to find how ill the said States have answered these their Civili∣ties, and especially by the Acts of Hostilitie which they have lately exercised against this Common-wealths Fleet, and having taken the whole into their Consideration, as well as the severall Papers presented to the Councel of State by their Ambassadors; They do thereon answer, That as they are ready to give a favour∣able
interpretation to the expressions contained in the said Papers, tending to represent how that the last Fight which hapned lately, was without the knowledge, and contrary to the in∣tentions of their Masters; so likewise, when they consider how incomformable and inconsi∣stent with these Thoughts and Discourses the proceedings of their State, and the behaviour of their Sea-men hath been in the very midst of a Treaty, and in what a manner the said particu∣lars have been Negotiated here by their Ambas∣sador; The extraordinary preparations of a 150 Ships without any apparent necessity, and the In∣structions which were by the said Lords States given to the Sea-men, we have but too great cause to believe; That the Lords the States General of the united Provinces, have a designe to usurp the known right which the English have to the Seas, To destroy their Fleets, which after God, are their Walls and Bulwarks, and thereby to expose the Common-wealth to an Invasion, according to their own good liking, even as they have attempted to do by their last Action: whereupon the Parliament do think themselves to be obliged, to endeavour by Gods assistance, as they shall find occasion for the same, to seek the reparation of those Wrongs which they have already received, and an assu∣rance for the future against the like which might be attempted against them: However with a desire and an intention that things may be composed and put up in an amicable way, if it
be possible by such waies and means as God by his Providence shall lay open, and by such circumstances as may tend to hasten this Designe, and may render it more efficacious then any other of the like nature hath not yet been. Open War with Hol∣land.So that this Conference besides many others, having not been caple to produce the Agree∣ment and expected Reconciliation; the Hol∣land Ambassadors took their leaves of the Parliament, by a publick Audience, and went their ways. And immediatly both these powerful Common-wealths prepared for an open VVar, all the Waters of the Ocean being not able to quench their just Indignations, and those Forces which they will both engender upon the Surface of the Sea, may well and duly represent unto us the Image of the Chaos, and the VVars of the Elements. The Hol∣landers Fisher∣men de∣stroyed in the North.General Blake who seemed to have fast∣ned the Saile of Fortune to his most pro∣digious mast by the glorious appearance of his gallant and resolute Fleet, makes Saile towards the Northen Parts, and about the Isles of Orkney, and seised upon all the Hol∣land Vessels which he found Fishing on that Coast, most part of the Fishing Barques he sent away, and discharged as unwor∣thy Objects, or Ornaments to so state∣ly
a Navall Armado; but the twelve Holland Men of War which were to con∣voy and secure them, he brought home with him. A Holland Fleet destroy∣ed by Sir Geo. Askue.On the other side, Sir George Askue remaining in the Channel with another Squadron of Ships, to clear and guard the same, discovered thirty Saile of Hollanders betwixt Callis and Dover, to which he gave Chace, and constrained them all for the most part to run a shoare on the Coast of France, onely ten ex∣cepted, which were taken, burnt, and sunck, and in reference to this fatall Rupture, there was not a day past wher∣in Prizes were not made by the Eng∣lish on the Hollander and French, who likewise were not as yet well reconciled to the English. Thence Sir George Askue set Saile to∣wards the West, as well to seek out for the Hollander, as to guard those Coasts, and to convoy the Merchant-Men which were ready to set Saile from Plimouth through the Channel, and being come within seven or eight Leagues of the said Port, he had notice given him that the Holland Fleet was not far off, where∣upon calling a Councel of Warre, it was conceived they might be met with about the Coast of France, a Resolu∣tion was taken to make Saile thither∣wards;
and the same day which was the sixteenth of August, betwixt one and two of the Clock in the After∣noon they discovered the Holland Fleet, and immediatly made up towards them as fast as they could, and found them to be sixty Men of Warre, and thirty Merchant men; the English were but eight and thirty Men of Warre, foure Fire Ships, and foure small Frigats, who notwithstanding the inequalitie of of their Number, about foure of the Clock of the said Afternoon, encoun∣tred the Enemy with as much Gallan∣try and Resolution as possible could be expected. The Plimouth fight with the Dutch.And Sir George Askue seconded by six other Ships immediatly Charged into the very Body of the Enemy, and however they were sufficiently dama∣ged by this first Charge, in their Sailes Masts, and Yards, yet they got to the Wind-ward of their Enemies, and once againe Charged the whole Body of them, continuing their said Combat very fiercely in this wise, and al∣wayes being intermingled pell-mell with the Enemy; untill the obscurnesse of the Night had seperated them, and had the rest of the Fleet imployed their parts as well as Sir George Askue's Squadron did, it is believed the whole Hollands
Fleet had been destroyed: amongst the English there were severall hurt and kil∣led, however but one Person of Note, Captaine Pack a Person of Honour, and a very Valiant, stout, and experi∣enced Sea-man, whose Legg being shot off by a Cannon Bullet, he died im∣mediatly; there were also two other Captaines hurt, Viz. Little, and Whi∣teridge, Two of the Holland Men of Warre, and one of their Fire Ships were sunck, as might be guest by the Wrecks afterwards; for the Night which terminated this Fight, did also debarre the sight of the Fleets what it had pro∣duced: So that the Hollanders conti∣nued their Course towards the Coast of France, and the English towards Pli∣mouth, to repaire their Vesseels, but especially their Masts, Yards, and Tack∣ling, which were so much endamaged, that they were forced to give over the pursuite of the Enemy. Six Hollanders Ships taken by Gen. Blake.And much about the same time that this Fight happened, Generall Blake steeting North-wards, took six Holland Ships of a great value about the Downes, and sent one Frigat toward the East, to re-inforce Sir George Askue; presently af∣terwards Captaine PenneSix more ta∣ken by Cap∣tain Penne. plying also up∣on the Coast of France, took six Hol∣land Ships, which had formerly been
in the Venetian Service, and were all of them bound homewards richly Laden, being all Men of Warre of considerable Burthen. A French Fleet taken by Gen. Blake. On the fifth of September, General Blakes Fleet riding at Anchor in the Downes, having notice that a French Fleet was to touch in Callis Road, there to take both Men and Ammunition on Boord for the Reliefe of Dunkirk, he weigh∣ed Anchor and made towards them, and about five in the Evening they were tiding it out of Callis Road, with a Designe in the Night to have set Saile towards Dunkirk: But General Blake as soon as they were got to Sea gave them Chace, and pursued them to the very Flats be∣fore Dunkirk, as farre as he durst, by reason of the Flats, and the Burthen of his Ships; he took seven of their Men of Warre, the least carrying two and twen∣ty Guns, and one Frigat with eight Guns, and also one of their Fire Ships; whereupon the Garrison of Dunkirk ha∣ving been disappointed of their expected Reliefe of Ammunitions and Provisions: Not long after was forced, together with the rest of the Garrisons which depended on the same, to yield to the Spaniards. On the twenty seventh of September, General Blake discovered about sixty Saile of Holland Men of Warre, Comman∣ded
by Admiral Dewit, on the back-side of the Goodwin Sands, so that next day he set Saile and made towards the Ene¦my, but falling upon a Flat called the The Kentish Knock, a fight with the Hol∣landers. Kentish Knock (under which the Hol∣lander had purposely sheltred themselves, to endanger the English, should they at∣tempt to gain the Windward of them) they found they had but three Fathome Wa∣ter, so that severall of the Fleet struck upon the Sands, but had no other harme, which caused them to stand off againe, and to make directly towards the Ene∣my, endeavouring to engage them to a Fight: But the Hollander being unwilling to engage, all that day past in slight Skir∣mishes onely, towards Evening the Hol∣landers changed their Station, but kept themselves off from the English towards the Flats, making a shew of being desi∣sirous to fight: But the next Morning by break of day, the English Fleet perceiving that the Hollanders were gone about two Leagues Northward from them, they re∣solved although they had but very little Wind, and that various to make up to∣wards them, which they endeavoured all the Morning, but could not reach them, the Wind being come North, inclined to the West: However the best Sailing Fri∣gats were commanded to make after them, and to keep them in play till the rest of
the Fleet could get up to them, and about three in the Afternoon, the said Frigats with much ado got within shot of them, but the Hollander fearing least by degrees they might be drawn to a generall Com∣bat (as it indeed was the English's, De∣signe) hoyst up their maine Top-sailes, and fairely run away: Notwithstanding which, ten good Frigats gave the Chace, till ten at Night, and the next Morning by the favour of a fresh Gale from the South∣west, the whole Fleet pursued them till they came to West Cappell in Zeland, when as they put into Gore, the English would faine have falne on and fought them in their own Ports, but a Councel of Warre being called, it was judged unfitting to pursue them any further upon their owne Coasts, by reason of the Flats, and also by reason that the English Provisions be∣gan to fall short: The Hollanāers loss in this Encounter is not well known, that which was visible was, that three of their Ships were disembled from fighting, the one having her Main-mast shot downe, and the Mizen-mast, Bowsprits, Staies and Tackling of the other two; the Admiral of their Reare Squadron was reduced to so ill a plight, as being not able to make any way of her self, they were constrained to tow her a long by a Hoy of two and thirty great Guns, which advanced but
slowly forward: so that the Nonesuch Fri∣gat boarded her, and having put thirty men over into each Vessell, they mastered them, but finding that they were extream leakie, and began to sinck, they took eigh∣ty men out of them, and their Officers, the Reare Admiral, and the Captaine, and left the Hulks to serve the dead men for a Cof∣fin: The English had but forty men killed, and as many hurt. Now the fame of this notable Warre between these two Queen∣ly and Mistress Common-wealths of the Navigation, having spread it self through∣out the Universe in all places where Trade and Commerce is used; The effects there∣of appeared shortly after in the Mediterra∣nian Seas, as well as in the Ocean and in the English Channel: Some Frights were sent towards the Levant, to guard the En∣glish Merchant Men from the French Ship∣ping of Marselleis, and Toulon, a Squadron of which Frigats consisting onely in foure Saile of Ships, viz. The Paragon, the Phe∣nix, the Constant Warwick, and the Eli∣zabeth, convoying three Merchant Men, two of which had taken in their Lading at Scandaroon, and the other at Smyrna, were encountred by eleven Holland Men of War, who made up towards them, and set upon them; All that the English could at first do, was to returne their broad Sides on
their Poopes, to let them see that they were not affraid of their exceeding them in number, but ere the fight was well begun, the Night separated them, and the next Morning the Hollanders began the fight a∣gaine, and were received as briskly, as if they had been equally matched. The Masts and Yards of two of their Ships were quickly shot downe, and another was set on fire, but quickly recovered; The Phenix a gallant Frigat of five and forty Guns was boarded by a huge States Ship, and after a marvellous defence lost al∣most all her Men (and being over pow∣erd) was forced to yield, but not with∣out a great loss on the Hollanders side; Nor did the English quit the fight till all their Men and Ammunition were killed and spent: The Paragon lost seven and twenty Men, and had sixty wounded, the Elizabeth had but two Barrels of Powder left; However they disengaged themselves from so great a number of their Enemies, and put their Merchant-men safe in Porto-longone; So that the Hollander had not much to brag of in the fight which hapned neer Corsica. Much about this time an Ambassador from the Queen of Sweden; Two Ambassa∣dors arrive in England. but before he had made the least overture of Business, he dyed: Another Ambassa∣dor arrived from the King of Denmark, but
finding that it was impossible to reconcile the differences betwixt the two Common-wealths, he withdrew againe and went his wayes, by reason of the common Interest of the Danes, and the united Provinces: And the Parliament having notice that the Hollanders who blocked up the passage of the Sound, had constrained two and twenty English Merchants coming from the Eastern Parts towards England, to put themselves under the King of Den∣marks protection, ordered eighteen Saile of Ships to go to fetch them home, the ra∣ther because they were Laden with such Merchandizes, as were at that time very usefull for the State, and without which the Warre against the Hollanders could not be prosecuted nor continued. Severall passa∣ges between the English & the Danes.On the nineteenth of September, the Fleet set saile from Yarmouth, and the next Morning they came to Anchor within two Leagues of the Castle of Essenhoeur, in Den∣mark, whence the Commander in chief sent away the Greyhound Frigat, with a Letter directed to the Governour of the Castle, and another to the Admiral of Denmark, by which he desired them to informe the King of Denmark of their arrivall, and of the Subject thereof, whereunto he ad∣ded a third Letter, directed to the Masters of the English Ships, ordering them to
make their Addresses to the King of Den∣mark, and to procure libertie from him that their Ships might with all speed be suffered to come out of the  of Co∣penhagen, where they as then lay: But the Frigat was not suffered to approach neerer then within a League of the Castle, whence she returned againe. The next Morning the Commander in Chief him∣selfe went thither in his long Boat, and declared the Subject of his Arrivall, and delivered his Letters, but no Answer was returned unto him, which obliged him the second time to send to the King, and to the English Merchants, but with∣out successe, for the King was not to be heard of, nor seen, nor to be spo∣ken with; at length two Lords sent from the King of Denmark, came to Elsenore Castle, whither also the Cap∣taines of the English Fleet went, who vigorously pressed the Restitution of their Merchant-men: But in answer to this their Demand they were interroga∣ted; Wherefore their Ambassadour had not been admitted to Hearing at his be∣ing in England? wherefore they came so boldly into his Majesties Seas, and so neer to his place of Residence, and of his Castles, with so strong a Fleet, be∣fore they had given notice thereof three weeks before?
But the English not standing to Can∣vasle these Demands, save onely to procure satisfaction on their Pretenses, pressed to have a positive Answer retur∣ned thereunto: Whereupon on the se∣ven and twentieth of the said Moneth they received a Letter from the King of Denmark, telling them, That he would preserve the said Ships for the Merchants, as carefully as he had hitherto done, but that he would not deliver them into their hands. Whereupon the English Mer∣chants, and the Masters and Sea-men, seeing there was no hopes to get their Ships released, abandoned them, and came aboard of the Fleet, and straight∣way quitting the Sound, made over a∣gaine towards England, but in the Night of the following Day, which was the last of the Moneth, the VVeather pro∣ved so dark, that the Admiral Ship Commanded by Captaine Ball,The Antelope Frigate lost. steer∣ing too much towards the shore, run on ground upon the Coast of that Sand, where she was lost, onely all the Ships Com∣pany was saved, and it was ten to one that the whole Fleet had not followed her, she bearing the Lanthorne: she was an excellent Frigat, called the An∣telop, carrying fifty brass Gunnes. But this Losse was presently after repaired by
20 Holland Barques, and 2 Men of War taken.taking of about twenty Holland Barques, and one Convoy Man of Warre, as al∣so one other Ship carrying twenty Gunnes, and thus without any other Losse, or ad∣venture, they returned into England, and on the fifteenth of October, they came to an Anchor in Burlington Bay, within a little while after Master Brahaw was deputed in the quality of an Envoy, or Deputy towards the King of Denmark, to try whether the Restitu∣tion of those Merchants Vessels might not be procured in an amicable way, but this Attempt proved as bootlesse as the former; For the said Ships were not onely detained, but their Lading was carried on Shoare and Sold: Which Acts of Hostility committed against the Law of Nations and of Hospitality to in∣nocent Persons, and against a State which had desired their Amity, by all wayes and means possible, will sooner, orlater meet with their Reward and Punishment, either by the hands of those who were en∣damaged, or by some others, which by the sequell you will find proved so. But to return againe to the Hollander, who were almost enraged at their conti∣nuall Losses of their Ships, with which all the Havens in England were filled, and being resolved to be revenged for so many
Another Sea Fight betwixt the English & the Hollander, in December.Sea Fights as they had lost, busied them∣selves in setting forth a great Fleet, and notwithstanding the rigour of the Season in the very midst of Winter, they came to Sea with a Fleet of ninety Saile, and ten Fire-ships; and on the twentieth of December, they appeared on the back of the Goodwins, the English Fleet un∣der General Blakes Command, con∣sisted but in two and forty Ships, ill furnished, wanting Men, and all o∣ther Necessaries: The greatest part of the best Ships having been rendred inca∣pable of going forth to Sea; whereas there was the greatest occasion to make use of them, which happened either by the negligence, or rather by the perfi∣deousness, and treachery, and set Ma∣lice of some, who at that time had the management of the Sea Affaires, being over jealous that the Military Persons and Men of Action, should grow too high and over-top them; although afterwards God in his own time found out these men, and caused them to give an account of these their pernitious aversnesse to the publicke Good of the Common-wealth, and to the private interests of the parti∣cular Members thereof. Hower the Eng∣lish, notwithstandsting the Inequality of their Forces, resolved to Launch out
and fight them so that on the thirtieth of December being a very faire day, both Fleets steering Westward, encountred each other about eleven of the Clock in the Morning, and began the Fight, the English having the upper hand of the Wind; of two and forty English Ships, not one halfe of them engaged in the fight for want of men, insomuch, that twenty, or two and twenty Ships bare the brunt of the puissant Holland Fleet. The Avant guard, and the Victory, two brave, Frigats, having been the whole day engaged in the midst of the Enemy, firing from all sides, got off in a very good Condition: But towards the E∣vening, the Garland, carrying about forty pieces of Cannon, was boorded at once by two great Dutch Ships, which she manfully resisted, till her Decks were quite unfurnished of men, which having blowne up, and finally being over powered on all sides, was forced to yield. The Bonaventure being a Mer∣chant-man, but a, good Vessell going to relieve the Garland, was clapt a∣boord by a Man of Warre, and after she had severall times cleered her Decks of the Enemy, which were gotten into her, at length by the death of her Cap∣taine, who behaved himselfe stoutly,
she lost both Strength and Courage, and so fell into the hands of her Ene∣mies. Meanwhile, Generall Blake, who Commanded the Triumph, seeing this Disorder, plunged into the thickest of his Enemies to rescue the Garland, had his fore-Mast shot downe close by the Boord, and was Clapt on Boord by the Enemy, but having stoutly de∣fended himselfe, and severall times beaten them off againe, he at length got cleare of them, and went off with the rest of his Fleet, onely with the losse of two Ships, which cost the Dutch deare enough, before they got them: and after the fight two English Merchant-men falling casually into the Hollanders hands, helped to make up the Friutes of this their great boasted of Victory over the English, which be∣ing in it selfe but a small Check, ser∣ved onely to whet the Valour of the Eng∣lish, and to edge them on with the more vehemency to dissipate that Ecclipse which had so lately over Clouded their wonted Glory; Wherefore they made a very considerable Sea Equipage, and fitted out with all speed a brave Fleet of the best and gallantest Ships, as well to bring downe their Enemies Pride, who were devoid of all Moderation, after
this their pretended Successe, as to stop and silence the Murmurings and Cla∣mour of the People, against those who at that time held and guided the Reines of the State; some of which be∣haved themselves so untoward, that it could not be imagined, save that by a base and vile black pollicy they inten∣ded, together with the Ruine of Ma∣ratine Affaires, to bring Destruction upon the whole LAND.
THE HISTORY OF OLIVER Lord Protector, From his Cradle to his Tomb. HIs Highness at that time being Gene∣ral, was as it were seized with a kinde of horrour, by the very sense of these disorders, which could not be excused either by reason of the disabillity of the Countrey, of any misfortunes, or ill accidents, nor by any imprudence, but were manifestly committed out of meer malice, through a blinde zealous ambition, His great soul did even re∣proach him inwardly for letting the honour of his Countrey (as it were) fall to the ground; and that a Million of brave Merchants were suf∣fered to run into perdition, by default of a dis∣creet Pilot to steer at the Helme, which was so ill guided; and although the Sea-affairs did not properly concerne him, He conceived how∣ever, that in case during the General Shipwrack, he launched into the Main with some small Barks to save the grand Vessel and body of the State
which was perishing, he might do both a bene∣ficial, commendable, and praise-worthy work. He therefore believed that in Honour and Con∣science he was bound to dive more narrowly in∣to the secret of the Affairs, and to employ the keenness of his Sword to set an edge upon the subtil Cabinet pens, and mend their bluntness and dullness: so that after the most requisite Orders for the arming and equipying of the Fleet had been issued out, he hammered out some others, for the better encouragement of the Sea-men in general, as well Commanders and Soldi∣ers, as Mariners. In reference whereunto it was ordered, 1. That some musters should be advanced them, to put themselves in a fit equipage to go to Sea, and to leave a subsistence with theit fa∣milies during their absence. 2. That for every ship which was adjudged good prize in the Admiralty, they should have two pounds per Ton, and six pounds for every peece of Canon, Brass, or Iron, as should be found in the said Vessels, and the which should be equally distributed amongst them in relati∣on to the Offices they bear in the Ship which had taken the said prize. 3. That they should have ten pound for every peece of Cannon on board of such Ships as they should sink, or destroy by firing, or otherwise. 4. That those who should enroll themselves before the forty dayes should be expired, should receive a moneths pay as a gratuity which should not be put to accompt.
5 That Hospitalls should be erected at Do∣ver, Deal, and Sandwich, for such sick and wounded Men as should be brought on shoar; and that a Stock should be settled for their maintenance, as also for the subsistence of such other sick and wounded men, as by reason of their Diseases and Wounds could not be brought on shoar, or should be too far from Hospitals. Diverse other Ordinances of the like nature were also settled, which did wonderfully encou∣rage the Sea-men and Mariners; so that to∣ward the latter end of February; 1653. the English put forth a puissant Fleet to Sea, fright∣ed with gallant men, who were resolved to fight it out, although at that time the Hollan∣ders had made use of their best wits and strata∣gems, and had negotiated almost with all the Nations of Europe, to hinder the bringing in∣to England any Pitch, Tarr, Masts, and such other necessaries for the Navigation. This brave Fleet being in a longing desire to encounter their enemies; on the eighteenth of February about eight in the morning, descryed eighty Holland men of War conveying one hundred and fifty Merchant-men coming from Bordeaux, Nants, Roan, and other parts of France;A Fight between the Eng∣lish and the Hol∣lander, near the Isle of Wight & Portland. and just between the Isle of Wight and Portland, the foremost Frigots of the English Fleet, to wit, General Blake in the Triumph, followed by General Dean, and three or four others, began the fight; the rest of the English Fleet being towards the Coast, was not able to
get up; insomuch, that from eight in the morn∣ing till two in the afternoon, this small squa∣dron of General Blakes was enforced to stand out the brunt of above thirty of the enemies ships, with which they incessantly fought, and demeaned themselves gallantly; till at length about two in the afternoon, as aforesaid, half of the Fleet got up to them, and began the fight for good and all, which ceased not but with the dark night. The English lost the Samp∣son, a Ship which they had formerly taken from the Hollanders, and by reason she was quite shattered in pieces, they sunk her themselves after they had taken the men out of her; how∣ever she cost the Hollanders dear, for she sunk the Sip which had so evilly entreated her. On the ninteenth of February, the English again made up towards the Enemy, and gave them Chase for a long while together, and forced some of their Ships upon the Sands where they destroyed them. The day following, the Eng∣lish again assaulted the Hollanders, and the fight became more obstinate then on the two dayes before; but at length the Enemies having their bellies full, began to fire out of their Sterns, and like unto the Parthians to make a running fight of it; when as all their Merchant-men being not able to follow them, they be∣came unto the English like unto so many Golden apples which stopped their pursuit of the Ene∣my. Towards the evening they came towards the height of Bullen, but the winde coming North, North-East, and consequently not fit to
regain their own Coast, their sails and tackling being pretty well disordered, they resolved to come to an Anchor. The English in this fight took about fifty Merchant-men and nine men of War, they sunk several besides those the Enemies themselves sunk to save their men; their Ships having been sorely shattered upon the Coast of France; there were above two thousand of their dead bodies found floating, and there were above fifteen hundred Pri∣soners brought up to London. General Blake was hurt in this encounter, having done as much as could be expected from a gallant Sea-man; and likewise several of his Officers and persons of Mark, who behaved themselves couragiously, were both hurt and killed on this occasion. It is hard justly to describe the loss which the Hollanders sustained in this burnt, by reason that parties frequently endeavour to silence their disgraces, and that the Sea doth usually better swallow up and hide the events and ef∣fects of such bloody Sea-fights then the Land. The Hollander by this prodigious and vast loss, being touched to the quick, did send a Letter to the Parliament, to endeavour to mediate a means to terminate these Differences, but the said letter being signed onely by States of Hol∣land and West Freizland, the Parliament made answer unto by a letter, witnessing their earnest desires to accommodate things in an amicable way, and so to stop the current of so bloody a War, but the said Negociation produced not the expected effect.
Mean time Fortune, which is as unconstant as the Sea it self, found out a way to produce the effects of her unstabillity better on this Element then on the Land; and this Goddess being thus exasperated at the constant prosperity of the English, would let them see that she had as great an advantage over their valour at Sea, as their Vallour had over her in their Land fights: Wherefore to bereave them of her Land-aids, she surprizeth them in forraign Seas, and causes them to seel one of her back-blows when they least of all expected it. Wherefore the English having by a stratagem recovered again the The Phe∣nix re∣gained. Phenix Frigot from the Hollanders; as she lay at an Anchor in the Mole of Leagorne, disposed themselves to a second encounter with the Hol∣landers in those Seas. A second Sea-fight in the Levant between the Eng∣lish and the Dutch.Captain Badiley with nine men of War set sail from Porto-Longone, to deliver and free cer∣tain Frigots Commanded by Captain Appleton, which were by twenty two Holland men of War cooped up in the Mole of Legorne, and had been detained in the like manner for several Moneths; the mischance was, that both these Squadrons could not come to fight the Hollanders at one and the self same time, for Captain Appleton and his Ships setting sail out of the said Mole sooner then they should have done, were im∣mediately surrounded by the whole Holland Fleet, who being more in number, had also the advantage of the winde. The Dutch Admiral seconded by two other great Ships, fell upon the Leopard a smug Frigat, carrying fifty peece
of Cannon, who for the space of five hours to∣gether maintained a stout fight against all the said Ships, whereas being over-powred by the number of their men, she fell into the Enemies hands; and a Cannon-bullet having unhappily fired the Bonaventure's powder, occasioned the loss of her without Labour or Vallour to the Enemy, for she was blown up; a loss which otherwise would have cost them dear. The Pil∣grim having sustained the brunt of four or five Holland Ships for a long while together had her Main and Mizen-Masts both shot down, and so was taken, being over-powred with numbers which she was not able to resist. The Levant-Merchant, another English Fri∣got, maintained a long fight against a great Hol∣land Ship of thirty six Guns, and being just on the brink of obtaining the Victory over her Ene∣my, (whom she sunk down-right a little after) was set upon a new by a fresh Ship as big as the former, with whom she fought two hours, and having lost all her men, was at length; taken. The Sampson on the one side being assaulted by young Van-Trump, who commanded the Admi∣ral of the Rere-Guard, and on the other side by a Fire-ship, was soon set on fire, and midst of the flames met with a Tomb which had some conformity to the noble heat with the which its company was animated. Thus you have a relation of the greatest misfortune which befell the English during the continuance of his whole War, and which was the more to be lamented, that it happened within sight of nine of their
own Ships, commanded by Captain Badiley, who could not with all his endeavours come up to joyn with them, but who was nevertheless so happy and so prudent as to save his squadron, after he had done the best to relieve his compa∣nions, and had seen that the disaster was not to be remedied. But let us for a while quit the Sea, and take a view of some Land passages, and see in what a posture the Affairs of great Brittain are with the neighbouring States. It is a thing worthy of observation and ad∣miration both together, that our Protectors Ancestors did alwayes bear this Motto in their Arms, Pax quoeritur Bello: which seemeth one∣ly to belong to Soveraign Princes, as if by a prophetical chance, or else rather by a Divine Providence, this Family, which as it seems was designed to bear the Scepter, and to restore and give peace unto England after so bloody a Civil War, and so many other forreign broyls, had received this glorious Motto as an earnest of its future Grandeur; which said Motto doth in substance contain all the mystery of the Politicks, and comprehend the two powers which God doth give to those whom he establisheth his Lievetenants upon Earth. In effect, we may ob∣serve that peace which seemed to have embra∣ced our incomparable Oliver, and as it were to have been incorporated with him, hath ever since grown up with him, until such time as its powerful branches, which encreased and grew up to an infinite height, had spread it felf so far,
as that this dutiful Daughter of Heaven whose growth is limitted by God, being not able to follow him no longer, was constrained onely to fix her self to the body of the tree, and to suf∣fer the branches to extend themselves to the other sides of the Sea-Coasts, for to deprive that Nation of Peace which doth least deserve it, having extended the War and her Tyrannies throughout all the inhabitable parts of the World. For as soon as his late Highness, our dread Protector, had attained to the power (by the means and force of Arms) in England, Scotland, and Ireland, Peace immediately brake forth, and resplendently shown throughout all those parts, and stopt those floods of Blood which could never have been stanched, but by the greatest branches of our illustrious Oliver: and not sooner had his Voice a transcendency in and over the Councels, but Peace continually accompanied his Oracles. Do but with me track the course of his fortunes, and you will finde that bright Astrea doth follow, or rather doth conduct and lead by the hand this blessed Deity, and chains her up to the triumphal Cha∣riot, there to humble her and to make her know, that this our Oliver was not the work of her hands, but rather of her own, since it is the end which doth alwayes Crown glorious and magnanimous Actions. Now whereas the last Victory which General Blake obtained at Sea, had gained a great stock of credit unto his late Highness, both at home and abroad; the whole English Nation began to witness a desire
that he would undertake the Management of Affairs, and put himself at the Helme of the Government; and likewise all Strangers and Forreigners endeavoured to be in a good under∣standing with England. A Portu∣gal Am∣bassadour obtains Peace.The King of Portugal sent an extraordinary Ambassadour over into England, with a gallant retinue, the stateliness whereof savoured of the profusion of Peace, which was also immediately granted them on very advantageous Conditions for England. And almost at the same time, two deputati∣ons were admitted from France, which King∣dom was again for the second time unfortunate∣ly divided by a Civil War. French Deputa∣tions sent to Eng∣land. The French King by his Deputy demanded the restitution of those Ships which had been taken by the English, as they were going to the relief of Dunkirk; and on the other part, the Prince of Conde sent a Deputy from Bordeaux (besieged by the King) to demand relief; but all the Civility England could shew either of them at that time, was, not to assent at all to their demands, and by that means remove all occasions of jealousie from each party: besides that business being too much exasperated between England and France, there could not so suddain an occomo∣dation be expected; and as to the Bourdelois, all men know those French Quarrels are as short as violent. Deputa∣tions con∣cerning a peace with Holland.In like manner, several other forreign Princes and States sent over Deputations into England, to endeavour to moderate a Peace between this Commonwealth and the Hollanders, as amongst
the rest, the Queen of Sweeden; The Cantons of Switzes, the Imperial Hansiatick Towns of Hamborough and Lubeck: But at that time there was such a combustion in the minde of the English, who were at variance amongst them∣selves, as that there was no appearance of think∣ing of any peace with strangers and forreigners. Affairs being therefore thus embroyled at home, his late Highness, as then General, seeing that in the Parliament, the particular Interests over∣swayed the publick Good, and that it was apa∣rent, all their drifts tended but to establish themselves into a perpetual Senate, contrary to the ancient Customes and Liberties of England, which require that Parliaments should have their successions, and should onely be convo∣cated from time to time; and that therefore the members of the house wiredrawed Affairs by unnecessary Centestations, which onely served to publish the designs, and to retard the exe∣cution of them. This our General, I say, who was designed by the Divine Providence to establish peace and tranquillity in England upon surer, more sollid, and more glorious Foundations, en∣tred the Parliament House, accompanied by the Chief Officers of the Army, and briefly repre∣sented unto them the Reasons why the Parlia∣ment ought to be dissolved; which was also ac∣cordingly done. The ong Parlia∣ment dis∣solved.The Speaker with the rest of the Members immediately departing the House; some by force, some through fear, and others not without a great deal of reluctancy and mur∣muring. No one living soul was aggrieved at
this action, neither was it so much as endeavour∣ed to be questioned or redressed by any one, all the world believing, that in case the said change should bring no good with it, at least it would not put Affairs in a worse predicament then they were: so that the sovereign Senate was dissolved, as you have heard, and the power thereof was transferred into the hands of those who better deserved it, since they acquired it by the points of their Swords; and that they have since made appear, that they knew how to use it with more prudence and moderation. Nay, the Parliament-men were even made so cheap unto the people, that they became their re∣proach and obliquie, and so were a consolation to the unfortunate, who saw themselves reven∣ged on them by those from whom they had least cause to suspect or expect it. There was not so much as the least questioning nor censu∣ring of the cause of this revolution, but every one found it expedient according unto the se∣veral satisfactions which he thereby received or hoped for; and as the Army was onely looked upon as Souldiers of fortune, whom the necessity of the Affairs, or the dangerous conjuncture of the times had enforced to take up Armes, so that which was past and gone was not laid to their charge; and the world could not choose but applaud them for what happened at present, but expect from them for the future that gene∣rosity which the Millitary profession doth in∣spire into great courages, as to this very day all men do enjoy, and are sensible of the favour∣able
effects which have since been produced. However, the universal joy which was so evi∣dently to be seen in all their countenances did not hinder, but that it was thought fitting for the better satisfaction of the generality, and of all men in particular, to publish the causes, the grounds and reasons of the dissolving of the Parliament, which was accordingly ordered by the General and by his Councel, consisting of the chief Officers of the Army, and was ma∣nifested accordingly in a Declaration, whereof the following are the chief Heads. The Lord General Cromwel and his Councells Manifest for the dissolving the Par∣liament. That after God was pleased marvellously to appear for his people, in reducing Ireland and Scotland to so great a degree of peace, and England to perfect quiet, whereby the Parlia∣ment had opportunity to give the people the harvest of all their Labour, Blood, and Treasure, and to settle a due liberty in reference to Civil and Spiritual things, whereunto they were ob∣liged by their duty, engagements, and those great and wonderful things God had wrought for them; But they made so little progress, that it was matter of much grief to the good people of the Land, who thereupon applied themselves to the Army, expecting redress by their means; who though unwilling to meddle with the Civil Authority, agreed that such Officers as were members of Parliament, should move them to proceed vigorously in reforming what was amiss in the Common-wealth, and in settling it upon a Foundation of Justice and Righteous∣ness; which being done, it was hoped the Par∣liament
would have answered their expectations. But finding the contrary, they renewed their de∣sires by an humble Petition in August, 1652. which produced no considerable effect, nor was any such progress made therein, as might imploy their real intentions to accomplish what was pe∣titioned for; but rather in aversness to the things themselves, with much bitterness and aversion to the people of God, and his Spirit acting in them, insomuch that the Godly party in the Ar∣my were rendred of no other use then to coun∣tenance the ends of a corrupt party for effecting their desires, in perpetuating themselves in the supreme Government. For the obviating of these evils, the Officers of the Army obtained several meetings with some of the Parliament, to consider what remedy might be applied to prevent the same; but such endeavours proving ineffectual, it became evident that the Parlia∣ment through the corruption of some, the jea∣lousie of others, and the non-attendance of ma∣ny, would never answer those ends which God, his People, and the whole Nation expected from them; But that this Cause which God had so greatly blessed, must need languish under their hands, and by degrees be lost; and the Lives, Liberties, and Comforts of his people be delivered into their Enemies hands: all which being sadly and seriously considered by the honest people of the Nation, as well as by the Army, it seemed a duty incumbent upon us who had seen so much of the power and presence of God, to consider of some  means
whereby to establish Righteousness and Peace in these Nations. And after much debate it was judged necessary, That the supreme Go∣vernment should be by the Parliament devolved upon known persons, fearing God, and of ap∣proved integrity, for a time, as the most hopeful way to countenance all Gods people, reforme the Law, and administer Justice impartially, hoping thereby the people might forget Monar∣chy, and understand their true interest in the ele∣ction of successive Parliaments; that so the Goverment might be settled upon a Right Ba∣sis, without hazard to this glorious Cause, or necessitating to keep up Armies for the defence of the same. And being still resolved to use all means possible to avoid extraordinary courses, we prevailed with about twenty Members of Parliament to give us a Conference, with whom we plainly debated the necessity and justness of our proposals; the which found no acceptance, but instead thereof, it was offered, that the way was to continue still this Parliament, as being that from which we probably might expect all good things. This being vehemently insisted on, did much confirme us in our apprehensions, that any love to a Representative, but the making use thereof to recrute and so to perpetuate themselves, was their aim in the Act they had then under consideration. For preventing the consumating whereof, and all the sad and evil consequences which upon the grounds aforesaid must have ensued, and whereby at one blow the interest of all honest men, and of this glo∣rious
cause had been endangered to be laid in the dust, and these Nations embroiled in new troubles, at a time when our Enemies abroad are watching all advantages against, and some of them actually engaged in War with us, we have been necessitated (though with much re∣pugnancy) to put an end to this Parliament. This Declaration and these proceedings of his late Highness, then General, and of his Coun∣cel of Officers of the Army, were backed by the consent of the Generals at Sea, and by all the Captains of the Fleet, and in like manner by all the other Generals and Officers of the Land for∣ces, both in Scotland, Ireland, and the other Ter∣ritories. But least the Magistrates and other publick Ministers of Justice and Policy, suprized at this suddain change, should chance to swerve from their duties; or that other persons should thereby take occasion to foment disturbances prejudicial to the Common-wealth, this ensuing Declaration was published.A Decla∣ration for settling a Councel of State. Whereas the Par∣liament being dissolved, persons of approved fidelity and honesty are, according to the late Declaration of the two and twentieth of April last past, to be called from the several parts of this Common-wealth to the supreme authority; and although effectual proceedings are, and have been had for perfecting those resolutions, yet some convenient time being required for the as∣sembling of those persons, It hath been found necessary for preventing the mischiefs and in∣conveniencies which may arise in the mean while
to the publick Affairs, that a Council of State be constituted to take care of, and intend the peace, safety, and present management of the Affairs of this Common-wealth; which being settled accordingly, the same is hereby declared and published, to the end that all persons may take notice thereof, and in their several places and stations, demean themselves peaceably, giving obedience to the Laws of the Nation as heretofore, in the exercise and administration whereof, as endeavours shall be used. That no oppression or wrong be done to the people, so a strict accompt will be required of all such as shall do any thing to endanger the publick peace and quiet upon any presence whatsoever. Dated April the thirtieth 1653. subscribed Oliver Cromwel. These domestick revolutions did in a manner put a new life into the Dutch again, who thought that they would cause some eminent distractions and disturbances as well on the Seas as by Land. But they were very much deceived, for the Ma∣ratine Affairs of these Lands, on which either the good or bad fortune of England depended, were carryed on with so much dexterity, diligence, and vigour, as that they had reason to confess, that the change of the Pilot, and the entire obe∣dience which is rendered to an absolute Cap∣tain, who hath the sole power in his hands, are but ill signs that the Vessel should be therefore the worse guided and conducted. And to give you a proof of the truth, the Hollanders having at that time a vast number of Merchant-men in
their Harbours ready to set Sail, durst not ha∣zard them through the Channel, although they had a Fleet of ninety Men of War to conduct them. But conducted them by North of Scot∣land to reach the Sound, where they met with another great Fleet of their Merchant-men, some coming from Russia, some from the East-Indies, and others from France, all which they carryed home into Holland; after which, hearing that the English Fleet was steered Northward, instead of seeking them out, and to take the ad∣vantage of the English divisions, as they had pretended and bragged, they amuzed themselves in making several bravadoes in such places where there was neither honour, glory, nor benefit to be acquired: at length they steered towards the Downs where they carried away two or three despicable Barks, and sent some volleys of Cannon into Dover, their Hearts and their Sails being equally puffed up with these imaginary successes, which savouring something of their old Masters Jack Spaniards Rodomontado's, they thought they could not better express them then at that time, saying, That the English Fleet was to be cryed out by the sound of Trumpets and Horns, as if she had been lost. But the Winde being as unconstant as the Sea it self, and as dangerous, quickly tacked about to their con∣fusion, and the Old Proverb, That all the evil comes from the North, was made good to their cost and charges. For the English Fleet returning on a suddain from the Northward, on the twenty eighth of
May came into Yarmouth-Road, and on the first of June next ensuing, being at an Anchor, they discovered two Dutch Galliots, to which they gave chase till they came up to the body of the Dutch Fleet. A Fight between the Eng∣lish and the Dutch on the North Foreland.But the weather proving over∣covered and dusky, they could not joyn with them. On the third, the English being at An∣chor near unto the South-point of the Gober, descryed the Enemy about two Leagues to Lee∣ward of them, being about one hundred Sail of Ships, wherefore without loss of time the Eng∣lish weighed, and made up to them. The en∣gagement began between eleven and twelve at noon, and for some hours the fight was sharp untill about six in the evening; the enemy bare right way before the winde, and so ended that dayes fight. On the next morning both Fleets came in sight of each other, but there was so lit∣tle winde stirring that they could not engage each other till twelve at noon; The Dutch worsted and many Ships ta∣ken.when as they fell to it again for good and all, and after four hours fight, which proved very disadvantagious to the Hollanders, they thought it not fitting to contest any longer, but to get away as well as they could; However a fresh westerly gale arising very opportunely, the English being encouraged by their flight, bare in so hard amongst them, that they took eleven Men of War and two water Hoyes: in which fight one thousand five hundred prisoners were taken, and six Captains, besides which, six Holland Men of War were sunk, and all the rest of the Dutch Fleet had according to all probability been cut
off, had not the night happily closed in for them. But the darkness growing on, and the English finding themselves near the Flats, and necessita∣ted to stay and mend their Sails and Rigging, which were much shattered and torne, about ten at night they came to an Anchor. The great∣est loss the English sustained was of General Dean one of their Admirals, who was taken off by a great shot in the first dayes ingagement, and whose death did sufficiently recompence all the Enemies loss; he having been a person of repu∣ted Valour and great experience, besides which, there was one Captain slain, and about one hun∣dred and fifty men, and two hundred and forty hurt, but not one of the English Ships were lost. That which greatly encouraged the English and disheartned the Dutch, was the arival of General Blake to their aid and succour with sixteen good Men of War very opportunely. Now the Dutch by the favour of the night being gotten off, and having retired themselves into the Weilings, the , and the Texel, the English cal∣led a Councel of all the Officers, to advise on, what would be most expedient to be undertaken to improve this Victorie to the best advantage; and it was resolved, to advance with the whole Fleet as fast as they could to the Weilings as far as they could possibly approach with safety, by reason of the Flats and Shelves, and in this wise forrage the whole Dutch Coasts till they came to Texel: which being accordingly perfor∣med, and being arrived at the said height, they there remained a pretty while, taking every day some prizes more or less, to the great prejudice
The Hol∣landers pursued and block∣ed up in their own Ports.of the Dutch, whose Ships could neither get in or out of any of their Ports, as long as the Eng∣lish continued there: Nor could their Men of War unite and come to a head to make a body to come forth. Wherefore leaving them to take breath, and to recollect their spirits again, and so to think of the best means for their Delive∣rance, we will return for England again with our Fleet and see how squares stands there. General Cromwel who alwayes made use of more moderation then power in the Rise of his Fortune, being unwilling to deprive England of her ancient Liberties and Priviledges, resolved together with the chief Officers of his Army to assemble a Parliament.A Parlia∣ment cal∣led by Ge∣neral Cromwel. To invest them with the power of administring and exercising the Laws, and to appoint them as it were Judges of his Councel and Government. And the Warrants requisite thereunto were issued out unto such persons as through England, Scotland, and Ire∣land, were chosen by himself and his Councel, to assist in the said Parliament, for them to meet in the Councel-Room at White-Hall on the fourth day of the moneth of July, in the year of our Lord. 1653. A forme of which said War∣rant you have, as followeth, viz. For asmuch as upon the dissolution of the late Parliament, it became necessary that the Peace, Safety, and good Government of this Commonwealth should be provided for; and in Order thereunto, di∣verse persons fearing God, and of approved sidelity and honesty, are by my self, with the advice of my Councel of Officers, nominated, to whom the great
charge and trust of so weighty Affairs is to be Com∣mitted. And having good assurance of the love to, and courage for God, and the interest of his Cause, and the good people of this Commonwealth, I Oliver Cromwel, Captain General, and Comman∣der in chief of all the Army and Forces raised and to be raised within this Commonwealth, do hereby Summon and Require you (being of the persons nomi∣nated) personally to be and appear at the Councel-Chamber, commonly called or known by the name of the Councel-Chamber at White-Hall, within the City of Westminster upon the fourth day of July next ensuing the date hereof; then and there to take upon you the said trust to which you are hereby called and appointed to serve as a member for the County of , and hereof you are not to fail. Given under my hand and seal the day of  July, 1653. subscribed Oliver Cromwel. And in conformity to this Convocation, the nominated for every County did according∣ly meet on the fourth of July in the Councel Chamber, where the Lord General Cromwel, be∣ing accompanied with the greatest part of the Officers of the Army, delivered himself to the laid members in an excellent Speech; in which, his Prudence, Valour, and Piety, were at once manifested; but chiefly his passionate tender∣ness for the good of the Commonwealth in Ge∣neral, and for the peace and tranquillity of each member in particular: so that we may justly at∣tribute unto him the qualities both of a Caesar, and of a Moses, by reason of his elegant Speech which he prosecuted in this manner.
The Ge∣nerals Speech to the Mem∣bers. By recounting the many wonderful Mercies of God towards this Nation, and the continued Series of Providence by which he had appeared, in carrying on his Cause, and bringing Affairs to that present glorious condition wherein they were. He likewise manifested the progress of Affairs since the famous Victory at Worcester, as also the actings of the Army thereupon: After divers applications to the Parliament, and much waiting upon them, with the Grounds and ne∣cessities of their dissolving the last Parliament, which he declared to be for the preservation of this Cause, and the Interest of all honest men who had been engaged therein. In like manner, he set forth the clearness of the Call given to the Members then present, to take upon them the Supreme Authority; and from the Scriptures exhorted them to their du∣ties, and encouraged them therein. He further desired them, that a tenderness might be used to∣wards all conscientious persons of what Judge∣ment soever. Which said Speech was pronoun∣ced with such a grate tone, and in such excellent manner, as it sufficiently manifested, that as he himself was throughly perswaded thereof, the Spirit of God acted in and by him, he had a∣dorned it with no other eloquent phrase, save that of Holy Writ. The rest was a masculine and convincing stile, the comeliness whereof con∣sisted in its plainness, without any Rhethorical or Artificial words, but single and pure, such as proceeded from our Saviours Ministers, the
which begat the peace, tranquillity, and glory of all men. The In∣strument of Go∣vernment delivered to the Par∣liament.The Lord Generals Speech being ended, he produced an Instrument under his own Hand and Seal, whereby he did with the Advice of his Officers, devolve and intrust the Supreme Au∣thority and Government of this Common-wealth into the Hands of the persons there met in the manner aforesaid; who, or any Forty of them, were to be held and acknowledged the Supreme Authority of this Nation: unto whom, all persons within the same, and the Territories thereunto belonging, were to yield obedience and subjection. That they were to sit no longer then the third of November, 1654. And that three moneths before their dissolution, they were to make choice of other persons to succeed them, and whose Powers and Sitting should not exceed twelve Moneths time; at the end of which, they were likewise to take care for a suc∣cession in the Government. Which said In∣strument having been thus delivered unto them by the Lord General, he did again exhort them to take the Business to heart, and to set nothing before their eyes save the Glory of God, and the Good of Publick Weal; promising them, that on his part, he would neither spare his Goods, Life, nor his Rest, to answer that great Mercy of God which he had shown them, in making choice of them to follow those tracks which the Divine Providence had set before them for their good, and for the glory and tran∣quility
of these Nations. Finally, he recom∣mended them to the Almighties protection, and so together with his Officers withdrew, leaving them to take their places in the former Parlia∣ment House, and to act accordingly; who forth∣with named their Speaker, and took their pla∣ces, meeting in the House and sitting in due form. John Lil∣burn de∣mands Protection is denied and remit∣ted to the Law. Upon this change of Government, John Lil∣burne, the chief of the Levellers, of whom men∣tion was formerly made, and who had been ba∣nished the Land upon an Act of the foregoing Parliament, thought to be protected by this, and cast himself upon the Lord General; who being unwilling to interpose matters of that na∣ture, left him to the Law, whence he alwayes freed himself by a most strong fatality of For∣tune. And whilest this new Parliament is settling it self in England, let us look a while back into Scotland and Ireland, and see how things have prospered there since we left them. The state of Affairs in Scot∣land.Now al∣though the English were possessed of the best strong places and Forteresses of all Scotland, and of all the Castles and Forts of value in the Low-lands, yet however the High-landers who perceived their inaccessible Fortresses, did make continual excursions on the Low-lands, being a people hardy and laborious, faring hardly, used to the cold and rigorousness of those Climates, as swift and nimble as Stags; and however they have more Valour then Conduct, and more Te∣merity then Discipline, yet some of them chose
to be commanded by Glencarne, Athol, the Lord Seafort, and others; who framing several small Bodies of them, would unexpectedly fall in up∣on, and surprize the Inhabitants and English Souldiery, without either giving or taking quar∣ter, spoiling and murthering all that came in their way; and when the English would make shew to charge them, and to pursue them, in case they found themselves to be the weaker, they then betook themselves to their heels with such swiftness, and sheltering themselves in such unaccessible Rocks and Holds, that it was im∣possible to pursue or light upon them: by which advantages they were emboldned to commit se∣veral outrages, murthers, and had like to have surprized an English Ship which came to an an∣chor at Leevis Island, some of which ships com∣pany going on shore to get in fresh water and provisions, were detained by the Lord Seafort, who also sent a ridiculous Summons to the said ship for its surrender, freighted with threats and detestations of the English Government, al∣though the said ship the Fortune, bearing more sails then their threats could fill, laughed at their temerity, and got off at will. The state of Affairs in Ireland.Moreover, the state of Affairs in Ireland were much about the same predicament; for the Eng∣lish having reduced all the strong Holds of that Countrey, and having shipt away all those who had born Arms in the last Wars, to be trans∣ported into Spain, France, Flanders, and other parts whither themselves would go, those onely excepted, who during the first Rebellion, had a
hand in the murthering of the Protestants, and who were brought up through all the parts of the Countrey, were tryed, condemned, and ex∣cuted in great numbers, they drave the rest of the Irish into Cannaught, within the heart or center of the Countrey; where they are coop∣ed in by the English, who have possessed their Lands, and have given them others in that Pro∣vince to the value of them: however, the Eng∣lish were continually molested by the Out-laws of that Nation, the Tories, much like the Moss-Troopers, or Italian Bandittoes, but of late they are pretty well calmed, and almost quite exter∣minated. An admi∣rable effect of his Highness Prudence and JusticeMean while the continual Wars in Ireland, as well as the said Banishment and Executions, ha∣ving left above one half of Ireland almost as it were desart, and left all the rest of the Couu∣trey as a prey to the Conquerour; hereupon his late Highness made use of this occasion to give an evidence both of his Justice and Prudence to∣gether. For whether the Exchequer at that time was bare of Moneys or no, or whether this great Politician had wilfully deferred the paying of the English Forces in Ireland till this very time, the better to settle the English in those parts, he gave unto them those Lands which themselves had conquered, in part of their pay∣ment; whereby he did according to the usual saying, kill two birds with one stone, if not three; which is, that at the same also he did recom∣pense them with that which was far more worth then that which was owing unto them, and a far
more worth then that which was owing unto them, and a far more solid thing, which was not to be easily taken from them; so that part of the Irish Lands were alotted to pay the Soul∣diery, and at the same time to establish and set∣tle the Conquests of Ireland, by giving them a subsistence to maintain and preserve them in those parts. As for the other part of the said Lands, we must look back, how in the beginning of these Wars, the State being not in a capacity to furnish sufficient monies to defray the charges thereof, was Constrained to borrow monyes of private persons on the promises of paying them both Principal and Interest, as soon as the Con∣quests of Ireland should be perfected; and how∣ever since that time the scene of Affairs was migh∣tily changed, that those who were engaged in this promise, and who at that time governed the State, had no more power or might, and that his late Highness was not in reason bound to subscribe or make good those Conditions or Ar∣ticles on which they received the said monies, nor to heed the same at all; yet however by a transcendent act of Justice he consented unto the disposal of the remaining Lands towards the reinbursing of the Irish Adventurers, and by this means made his Laurels become as fruitful as if they had been watred by the sweat and labours of those people, and brought up at their costs and charges; so that he both satisfied the Souldiers Arrears, and the Adventurers Advances to their own content and hearts desires, and to his own praise and glory as long as the memory of man lasteth.
Continu∣ance of the Dutch Af∣fairs.Mean while the Hollanders being quite tired by their continual losses, and seeing that For∣tune remained obstinate to their prejudice, and seldome or never frowned on the English, re∣solved at length once more to come to a Treaty, and to this purpose sent four CommissionersHolland Commis∣sioners sent over to treat. in∣to England, viz. the Lords, Beveringe, Newport, Yongstal, and Vanderperre, which last no sooner arived here, but took leave of the world; so that the other three pursued their Negotiation with hopes of a good success: yet however these fair appearances did not produce either a cessation or a suspension of Armes, but both parties treated and fought together, insomuch that all kinde of hostilies were exercised on both sides against each other; and as they seem∣ed both desirous to shew the most of their pow∣ers, and that there was no necessity at all of a peace, so they came at length to a notable fight even during the Treaty, and the which did not a little conduce to hasten the Conclusion of the peace. The manner of which fight was as followeth. A notable fight be∣tween the Dutch and Eng∣lish during the Trea∣ty.On the twenty ninth of Iuly, two English Scouts, where abroad at Sea on intelligence, dis∣covered the Holland Fleet coming forth of the Wielings of about ninety five sail, all men of War; and as soon as the English Fleet received notice thereof, they made all the fail they pos∣sibly could toward them, but the Enemies dis∣crying our Fleet, witnessed a desire not as yet to fight and so stood away. But by five of the clock that evening some of the English Frigots getting
up to them, engaged them into a Fight; and soon after, thirty of our Ships seconding of them, began the Fight for good and all, and were constrained to bear the brunt of the whole Holland Fleet, by reason the rest of the English Fleet being asterne could not get up to engage. However they were onely separated by the night which forced both Fleets to retreat; and the Fight although it was but short, yet it proved smart, and the Hollanders had several of their Ships put out of a condition to serve, being so soarly maimed, that they were forced to send them away in the night, by the favour whereof they got by the English, and strove to joyn with a relief of five and twenty good Ships which which were coming to the mouth of the Texel. The Fight renewed.On the morrow, the Hollanders being encou∣raged by their new recruits which they had joyned with the night before, by reason of the thick and fowl weather which hindred the Eng∣lish from debarring them thereof, fell first of all upon the English Fleet with a great deal of gallantry and resolution; and from five in the morning till one in the afternoon fought as cou∣ragiously as possibly men could, either in re∣spect of the Valour they shewed, or in their conduct and dexterity in mannaging of the said Fight; and the English on their sides being well pleased to have to do with so gallant and reso∣lute an enemy, and who promised them a great deal of glory in their manful and vigorous re∣sistance, received them as gallantly on their parts; and the fight being by this time well ex∣asperated
on both sides, they passed through, and upon each other with so much violence, im∣petuosity, and dexterity, as that it might be easily conjectured each particular person knew that the whole decision of the War depended on the event of this combat. The Sea was never so much pressed by its contrary Elements, and the combatants which covered the Decks and Gal∣leries appeared like unto so many Salamanders that live in the fire; and indeed the zeal and earnestness which transported them were of the very same nature; each Vessel chose another to try the day withal, and whensoever one was charged by two or three, more or less, that one∣ly served to waken her dexterrity, and to excite her resolution; and those who could not burn, destroy, or sink their Enemies by a close boarding and grasping hand to hand, endeavoured to dis∣pute that which their Cannons could not ef∣fect. The Fight at length became so obstinate and violent, as that the Air was red by fire, and the Sea with blood, and these two floating Forests, whose high and thick Masts sunk as fast as the Corn under the Mowers hand, gave to believe by their redoubled and obstinately con∣tinued blows, that the Sea would at length serve both the Fleets for a Triumph and a Tomb. The Dutch Admiral Van-Trump slain.And in the very midst of this contest, the Hol∣land Admiral Van-Trump being wounded, pre∣saged his death, wherefore like a Lion, who ha∣ving received his mortal wound by the hand of the Huntsman, redoubleth his force ever at the Article of his expiring; so this famous and re∣nowned
Admiral did sell his life at a dear rate, and had received that happiness to be sprinkled with the blood of his Enemies in that barbarous Element in which he had so often sown his Palms and Laurels. In like manner, the Generals Blake and Monk did most admirably well sustain the last Assaults of this desperate dying Admiral, who desired not so much to live as to revenge his own Death; Both these gallant Generals I say were present every where, and in all occasions; and where their persons could not shew themselves, Vice-Admiral Pen and Rere-Admiral Lawson, so well supplied their places, as that the Hollan∣ders encountred none but Admirals whereso∣ever they charged. Finally, all the English as well Officers as Sea-men behaved themselves wonderously well, and had the Honour to ob∣tain joyntly with the Laurels of War, the Ro∣ses and Olive-branches of a glorious Peace. And amongst the rest of the Holland Ships of note, the Garland a stout man of War, which the Hol∣landers had formerly taken from the English was laid aboard by the Worcester Frigot, and was fired and burnt by her. The Triumph and the Andrew of the English side were also boar∣ded by two or three Dutch Fire Ships, and recei∣ved some dammage in their sails and rigging, but were quickly again cleared by the Valour and in∣dustry of the nearest Ships, and some of particu∣lar persons. As to the Hollands Fleet, it seemed to have been all on fire, so well did the English Fire Ships second by their dexterity the men of
War, and the Cries of those who saw their ships rouling and sinking alike, were more formidable and loud then the roarings of the Sea; so that as they endeavoured to avoid the flames, they were sure to finde their deaths in the merciless Waves. There were at least twenty Holland men of War burnt and sunk in this fight, and almost all their Companies lost, although the English took more glory to save them, then their valour as it seems had to destroy them; the generosity of the English causing them to precipitate themselves midst all dangers whatso∣ever, to save the lives of above a thousand of their enemies: amongst which, there were six Captains which the Hollanders themselves had abandoned, by reason they were not in a capa∣city to save them. The Dutch put to flight. Finally, the Hollanders seeing so great a num∣ber of their ships sunk and lost, began to despair of the Victory; and the spirits of their men be∣ing drowned and fallen, they thought it not fit∣ting to expose themselves with the rest of the Fleet, to the hazard of a general defeat and rout, they faced about, and began to bear away with all the possible sail they could make to∣wards the Texel. And the English not judging it expedient to engage too far upon the Dutch Coast by reason of the Flats, the Winde being also very uncertain and inconstant at that time, and moreover their sails and tackling being suf∣ficiently torn and rent, they resolved at a Coun∣cel of War, to set sail with the whole Fleet to Soles-Bay, to dispose of such ships as were dis∣abled,
and to put their wounded Men and Pri∣soners on shore, and sending two small Frigots to observe the Course they steered, who kept in sight of them till next morning by break of day, when as they steered into Texel Harbor, by the favour of certain Boats with Lights, which were sent them out to conduct them in. The loss which the English sustained in this Fight, was of about three hundred men who were slain out-right; amongst which there were eight Captains, to wit, Graves, Chapman, Tailor, Newman, Crispe, Owen, Cox, and Peacock; the wounded were about seven hundred in number, whereof five were Captains, viz. Stokes, Sea-man, Rous, Holland, and Cabitt, who all of them behaved themselves like persons of Courage and Conduct. As for the number of the killed and hurt on the Hollanders part, we can make no other guess thereat, save onely according to the number of the ships which they lost, however several Letters from Holland certified, that in the Fight they lost about six thousand men. This Naval Conflict being the most bloody and most famous Fight which happened between the English and the Hollander since the Wars began, did evidently manifest what a kinde of Martial genious it was, that had gotten such a transcendency upon the deciding of a Victory; and how wise and vigorous a Pilot there was both at the Helm of the State and of the Fleet: So likewise the advantages which were obtained by this Victory were very considerable, during the conjuncture of Affairs at the present, just on
the point of an accomodation, which also ensu∣ed both unto the profit, honour, and glory of England. And in reference thereunto, the Par∣liament did acknowledge this so important and considerable a peace of service by all the marks of honour, which could be worthily conferred on persons who had so valiantly acquitted themselves. To the Generals, Blake, Monk, Pen, and Lawson, and to the other Flag Cap∣tains, Gold Chains were presented as precious tokens of their favour and acknowledgements; and to the other Officers of the Fleet, silver Med∣dals were distributed, which although they were not of so much value yet they bear as great a weight in the Scales and Ballances of honour and glory. The weakness of the new Parlia∣ment. And this very Parliament which truly had procured very beneficial Orders in matters of the lesser consequence, extreamly advantagious to the people, in respect of the small time during which they had been assembled, however in the greater concernments they had not so good For∣tune; there was so much of confusion in their Councels, such a contrariety in their opinions, such a dissonancy in their actings, and disparity in their aims and projections, as that this Senate was more like unto a Monster with many heads, then a well ordered grand assembly, or supreme Councel; insomuch, that there was little or no appearance it should continue out the pre∣fixed time of their sitting. Moreover, the chief∣est designes by their long and tedious discussions and debates did even perish and vanish through
the loss of those urgent actions which are the soul of execution, or became publick by a too publick devulging of such secrets as are not usu∣ally discovered by great Statesmen, untill the very effects of them are ready to appear. All which reasons being naturally pondered by the wisest and most zealous persons interessed in the glory of the English Nation, the good and well∣fare of the Commonwealth, and particularly by his excellency the Lord General, it was re∣solved that the Parliament should be dissolved; in reference hereunto, on the twelfth of Decem∣ber, 1653. as soon as the Parliament was met, A Member of the said House stood up and moved. A motion to dissolve the Par∣liament. That the sitting of this Parliament as it was then constituted, being not thought proper nor fitting for the good of the Commonwealth, It was therefore requisite to deliver up unto the Lord General Cromwel, the powers which they had received from him. Which motion being se∣conded by the greatest part of the other Mem∣bers, the House arose, The Par∣liament ment dis∣solved De∣cember, 12, 1653.and the Speaker accompani∣ed by the major part of the House departed, and went to White-Hall, where they did by a Wri∣ting under their hands (being the greater number of the Members sitting in Parliament) resign un∣to his Excellency the Power which they had re∣ceived from him, and the which was by the Speaker presented to his said Excellency accord∣ingly, in the Name of the whole House. No sooner was the Parliament dissolved and that Affairs of moment and weight came crowd∣ing in apace, but that there was a necessity (du∣ring
the intervalls of Parliament) to form (as it is called in forreign parts) an upper Councel, and to create a superiour dignity, to avoid both tediousness and confusion in the dispatch of Af∣fairs; which said dignity holding the mid-way between a Monarchial and Democratical, might avoid the inconveniencies which these two ex∣tremities are subject unto; and the thing it self having been well pondered and maturely delibe∣rated, the choice of the person on whom this dignity was to be conferred, was soon made, God having pointed him out unto them by a mark, those admirable and uninterrupted Vi∣ctories which he caused him to gain; and by those excellent productions of a minde, which had something of supernatural in it, and partaked of the Divinity. The Lord General Cromwel chosen and sworn Lord Pro∣tector. Wherefore the Lord General Cromwel was Elected, Declared, and Sworn at Westminster, in the presence of all the Judges and Justices, the Barons of the Exchequer, the keepers of the Liberties of England, the Lord Major and Al∣dermen of the City of London, with most of the chief Officers of the Army, Lord Prote∣ctor of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Islands and Territories thereunto belonging; and at the same time se∣veral Articles were presented to the Lord Pro∣tector, by which he was to govern the people; which being red unto him, he took a solemn Oath to performe and see them kept in the pre∣sence of the whole assembly, protesting more∣over, that he would minde nothing so much as
the good of the Commonwealth, the Glory of God, and the Honour of the English Nation. The chief heads of the Articles of Government were as followeth. The Pro∣tector Sworn to the ensu∣ing Arti∣cles.1. That the Protector should call a Par∣liament every three years. 2. That the first Parliament should assemble on the third of September, 1654. 3. That he should not dissolve the Parlia∣ment till it had sate five moneths. 4. That such Bills as he should not signe within twenty dayes should pass without him. 5. That he should have a select Councel to assist him, not exceeding one and twenty, nor less then thirteen. 6. That immediately after his Death the Councel should choose another Protector be∣fore they rose. 7. That no Protector after him should be General of the Army. 8. That the Protector should have Power to make Peace or War. 9. That with the consent of his Councel he may make Laws which shall be binding to the Subjects during the intervals of Parliament, &c. Immediately after which, the Lord General Cromwel, without the devesting of himself of the Command of the Army, (which he prefer∣red before all other charges) took upon him the title of Highness, and the dignity and name of Lord Protector. A very fit appellation, in re∣gard
of the Infantine, and as yet growing State of England, which the several Factions and Divi∣sions, as also the different Opinions in Religi∣on would have exposed to a numberless kinde of unavoidable miseries, had not a powerful Genius, armed with Force and Judgement, protected it from ripping up its Entrails and Bowels by its own hands. And immediately after, he was pro∣claimed Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland, &c. The Lord Protector proclaim∣ed. First in the Pallace yard at Westminster, by the Officers of State, and after∣wards at the Royal Exchange by the Lord Ma∣jor and Aldermen in their Scarlet Gowns. Some few dayes after the body of the City invited his Highness the Lord Protector to a most splendid feast and gallant entertainment, at Grocers-Hall; not so much to treat him with their good chear, as with the resplendent testi∣monies of their joy, and with the submissive tenders of their devoires. His Highness would by no means refuse to give that satisfaction to their evidences of re∣spect and joy; and the better to testifie unto them on his behalf, the high value he put upon their care and love, he set forth towards them in as great a pomp and magnificence as befitted a person invested with so eminent qualities; and as one who having reaped so many Laurels, had newly restored peace and tranquillity unto three distracted Kingdomes.
The manner of his Highness going to the City and reception there, was on this wise. His Highness's Life-guard of Horse marched in the first place, after which followed the chief Of∣ficers of the Army on Horse-back, and some of his Councel of State: after them rode two Pa∣ges bare headed in sumptuous Apparel; after them came twelve Lackeys in velvet Caps and gray Liveries, with silk and silver Fringe; then followed his Highness seated in a Charet of State drawn by six beautiful Horses richly trapped, which by their lofty gate seemed to glory in their drawing so victorious a Hercules, triumph∣ing over so many Monsters: and his Highness who alwayes preferred the little ornaments of the Soul before those of the Body, was onely clad in a dark coloured Suit and Cloak, the greatest part of the other Nobility attending in their Coaches and six horses. At Temple-Bar his Highness was met and re∣ceived by the Lord Major and Aldermen; and the Recorder of the City saluted him with an ex∣cellent Speech, containing several expressions of Joy, Fidelity, and Obeisance, and of good Hopes of his prosperous and happy Government. His Highness having thanked him, alighted from his Chariot, and quitting his Cloak, put on a rich Riding Coat imbroidered with Gold, and got up on Horse-back on a Palfrey richly trapped, and was followed by three other led Horses of State. By which change of Garments, his
Highness testified unto them, that when as occa∣sions of the States-service should call upon him, he would descend from his Triumphal Chariot, where the glory of his Conquests had set him in rest, and mounting his Horse for Battel, would expose his Life as freely, as he formerly had done, for the peace and tranquility of their Ci∣ty, and for the Liberty of England. The Lord Major rode all the way bare-headed, as also car∣ried the City Sword drawn before his late High∣ness the Lord Protector. By the one, represent∣ing the Respect and Obedience of the City; and by the other, its Fidelity and Resolution, to spill their Blood in the defence of the Peace of the State, and for the preservation of the Life and new Dignity of his Highness. The Streets were railed up, and the several Companies of the City in their Liveries sate on both sides of the way, with Streamers sticking up to distinguish each Company. Moreover, it is a thing worthy to be observed, how that the Character which God doth imprint on the Fore∣head of those whom he hath designed to be his Vicegerents on Earth, doth beget an astonish∣ment and fear in the hearts of those where it cannot raise a respect; but in the others, both admiration and love: so that on all sides the Di∣vine Providence compasseth its Glory, either by the means of its Justice or Mercy. And thus you see his Highness the Lord Protector passing through this great City, which was drawn up in Arms, having his Head onely covered with Lau∣rels, and his guarded with a simple though re∣splendent
morsel of Glory; The one surround∣ing him to cover and protect him with her wings; and the disarmed Justice which accom∣panied this great Heroes footsteps, seemed to Lead a naked and fettered Mars by a silken thread Sir Tho∣mas Viner Knighted. And thus after his Highness had been most splendedly entertained by the City, before he departed, he conferred the Honour of Knight∣hood upon the Lord Major, and left all the City filled with an admiration of his Heroick Vertues, and with a general satisfaction of his candor and generousness; their hopes being freighted with acclamations and good wishes. No sooner was his late Highness settled in the Supreme degree of his Protectorship, but just like the Sun elevated in a high sublime Sphere, he begat an infinite number of malignant Ex∣halations, which however were soon dissipated by his luster and resplendency; and at the same time by his vertue, he gave a life and being to all those glorious actions which knowing men did expect from his sage Government. A Conspi∣racy dis∣covered. On the Eighteenth of February, 1653. a most dangerous Conspiracy which was hatched by the Royalists was discovered; several of the Conspirators were taken and sent to the Tower of London. But his Highness willing to begin his Government by an Act of Clemency; and to let the world see, that the Grandor of his new Dignity did onely render him powerful to do good, he pardoned the said Delinquents, and caused them to be set at liberty.
Addresses to his Highness from all parts. Much about which time arrived Deputies from the several Counties and Shires as well of England, Stotland and Ireland, to congratulate his Highness happy Inauguration, and to assure him of their fidelity and submission to his Com∣mands; all which his Highness received with a great deal of Candor, and repaied them with Use (to wit) the establishing of good and salu∣tary Orders for the Peace and Tranquility of the Commonwealth, and each Member thereof in particular; Nor did he forget to regulate the Spiritual Affairs, and out of an infinite num∣ber of Opinions, he begat a pleasant harmony; the seeming dissonance and harshness whereof, was onely unsavory to the ignorant, and to such as had stopped their ears. The Scots frame an Army. Mean while the Scots animated by several dis∣contented persons here in England, did levy an Army by Command from their King, and began to take heart of grace again, reassuming their former courage and hopes. The Earls of Glen∣carne and Kenmore were at the Head of four thousand Horse and Foot, joyning several other small parties, which from all sides flocked down unto them. But Collonel Morgan was so vi∣gilant and active, that before they could have time to Form a greater Body, he marched with fifteen hundred Horse and Foot, and on the seventh of February he arrived at Lough,The Scots defeated by Collo∣nel Mor∣gan. which was the Enemies appointed Rendezvouz, where having charged them, after a short but smart Fight, he killed one hundred and fifty of them, and defeated all the rest, the Earl of Glencarne
with much ado making his escape onely with forty Horse. But all these small Bickerings, and as it were shadows of War, did onely serve as a foil to that most important and considerable Peace which both England and Holland was to reap at our Olivers hands. Peace with Holland concluded and pro∣claimed. When as most part of the Winter was well nigh passed over in this Negociation at London, where the Hollanders had four Ambassadours who daily laboured to compass the same. Two of them, to wit, the Lords Newport and Young∣stall re-passed into Holland about the Moneth of February, to communicate unto the High and Mighty Lords the States their Masters, the Con∣clusion of the Treaty, and to get them to ratifie the same. On the third of March 1653/4. of the same Year, they returned back again, where they were received with all the pomp and state that could possibly be imagined, and might demon∣strate the Joy which the Merchants conceived of the happy effects of so happy a Reconcilia∣tion. The next day they had Audience from his Highness, where declaring the full powers they had from the Lords States to ratifie the said Peace which they had made, they desired a speedy Cessation of Arms should be published on both sides; and in conformity thereto, on the fifth Day of April next ensuing, the Arti∣cles of Peace were signed, sealed, and delivered on the behalf of both parties, and were accord∣ingly published and proclaimed, to the general satisfaction of all men. And his Highness, the better to testifie the particular pleasure he took
therein, did most sumptuously treat the Holland Ambassadours; witnessing unto them by his noble Noble treatment, all the marks of Joy which might manifest and make good, by his Conduct and Entertainment, the old Motto of his Family, That War hath no other end save to beget a Peace. And as to the Affairs of Ireland, his Highness by his good Orders, and establishing the Natives in the Province of Cannaught, which is in the heart of Ireland, had settled all things so well in those parts, as that the English needed not to fear any either abroad or at home; The Af∣fairs of Ireland settled. and the Irish beginning to be sensible that the Yoke of a vigilant and absolute Protector was far more tollerable, and to be preferred before the Servi∣tude of a feeble and tottering multitude, who onely heeding their own preservations and par∣ticular interests, do abandon the People and their wellfares, either to their own capricious∣ness, or to the imbroils of ambitious and hot spirits, who abusing of the Commonalties sim∣plicity and sincerity, run them headlong into Ruine. But some enemies of the State perceiving that it was impossible to hinder the Earth from bringing forth of good fruits, as long as it was animated by so sensible and feeling a warmth, resolved to beget an Eclipse of its Sun; and ha∣ving covered it with darkness, to bring down Horrour and Confusion upon it: wherefore a black Conspiracy was hatch'd again his late Highness's Life; but Heaven which had pre∣servedA second conspiracy.
him for her glory, and for the good of England, and carried him through so many dan∣gers during the Wars, did even as yet watch over him in the times of Peace, and miraculously preserved him for this hainous attempt, as well as from many others. Several of the Con∣spirators were apprehended; and amongst the rest, Mr. Thomas and John Gerrard, Brothers, John Jones an Apothecary, and Thomas Tender, Somerset Fox, and Peter Vowel, who being Tri∣ed and Condemned to dye, Vowel was Hanged, John Gerrard by reason of his Birth was Behead∣ed; Mr. Vow∣el Hanged Mr. Ger∣rard Be∣headed. Thomas Gerrard and Fox were pardoned by his Highness, by reason of their ingenuous con∣fessions, and some other further discoveries which they made of the Fact. The Por∣tugal Ambassa∣dors Bro∣ther Be∣headed. At the same time the Portugal Ambassadors Brother was likewise Beheaded, for having cau∣sed the Death of an English Gentleman, at a hubbub and quarrel made by the Portugals in the New Exchange: neither could States policy, nor the complacency and gallantry which are often used by Princes, to the prejudice of the Commenwealth, and of the particular mem∣bers of the same, hinder the doing of Justice in this case; so much did the love of his Countrey, and the suffering of Justice to take place, prevail with his late Highness. The Scotch Highlan∣ders rise in Armes. Mean while, the Scotch Highlanders not be∣ing able to brook the English yoke, although they full well saw that their continual Conspi∣racies and Risings were discovered and crushed, yet they believed that a far greater and more
considerable one might happily break forth and shew themselves, in case any considerable party should rise in Armes; they therefore got toge∣ther in a body, and General Middleton being passed out of Holland into Scotland, joyned him∣self to them. But General Monk falling into the North of Scotland, and for some time driving them from place to place, did at length on the one and twentieth of July 1654. give them such a full charge at Loughberrie, that he defeated them and made them incapable of ever after thinking of appearing in Armes again.General Middle∣ton defea∣ted by General Monk. How∣ever, all these happy successes, such an absolute power, and so invincible an Army at command, did not at all insult in his Highnesses thoughts, nor puff up his minde, nor inhaunced his autho∣rity, save onely armed him with much precauti∣on as he stood in need of, to maintain the Peace and Tranquillity of the People, to augment their wealth, and to encrease the glory of the Commonwealth; therefore to produce that mediocrity which the Gown adds to Armes, and which publick Councels, do unto private Deli∣berations, on the third of September 1654. a Parliament A Parlia∣ment as∣sembly Septem∣ber 3. 1654. (which had been convocated by his Highness Writs according to the tenor of the precedent ones) assembled at Westminster, and began its sitting, after the members had been present at a most learned and eloquent Sermon preached by Mr. Marshal, when as Mr. Lenthal was declared Speaker of the House; and as soon as they were met, they fell upon the questioning of the Power by which they were convocated,
and doubted of its lawfulness; so that his late Highness considering with himself the evils which a new change might produce, caused a forme and acknowledgement of the Govern∣ment to be drawn up, which was to be signed by all the Members of the House before they were to meet again. The Tenour whereof follow∣eth, viz. The Recognition to be signed by the Members before they were admitted to the House in the Parliament of September 3. 1654. I do hereby freely promise and engage to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector, and the Com∣monwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and shall not (according to the Tenor of the Indenture, whereby I am returned to serve in Parliament, pro∣pose, or give my consent to alter the Government, as it is settled in one person and a Parliament. After which subscrption, the Members were admitted to assemble again; but not at all min∣ding those things which the State expected at their hands, and on the contrary, instead of cementing the commonalty in a perfect union; they fed them with vain and imaginary hopes, and endeavoured to disgust them with the Go∣vernment: giving them to understand, that they should enjoy happy dayes again, which they could not have hoped for till then, and which they were to expect from their consulta∣tions and assemblings. Wherefore his Highness
having had patience with them full five entire moneths, after he had several times exhorted them to follow more lawful courses, and not to forget their Duties by swerving from them in such a manner as they did: Parliament dved January 10. 1655.But seeing all this gained nothing upon their Spirits, his Highness dissolved the Parliament on the tenth day of January, 1655 five Moneths after its Convoca∣tion: and truly it was high time to put a peri∣od to their Consultation, which onely tended to have ript up again the old sores of the State, which his late Highness had so happily closed up; and to have engaged England into a worse Relapse then its former Mallady. Several Conspira∣cies disco∣vered. And the venom and rancor which was hatch∣ed in the said Parliament was so general, that it had spread it self through all the Counties of England. Sir Henry Littleton, and Sir John Packington, chief Actors in this Conspiracy, were apprehended; and Major Wildman on the be∣half of the Levellers was surprized and seized on, as he was dictating a Paper to one of his Servants, or rather a Libel, the Title whereof was, A Declaration containing the Motives and Reasons which oblige us to take up Arms against Oliver Cromwell. Nor did this discovery at all dishearten the Conspirators, the business being so general, and so many People being engaged therein, insomuch, that they ceased not to carry on the Design, which they grounded more upon the force then the fear thereof: and immediate∣ly News was brought, that a party of two hun∣dred armed men had entred the Town of Salis∣bury A Rising at Salis∣bury.
on Sunday about midnight, commanded by Sir Joseph Wagstaff, Penruddock, and Jones, who had been formerly Officers in the late Kings Ar∣my. They presently seized on all the Inns, and chief Houses; and whereas at that time the As∣sizes were held at that place, they were so bold as to take away the Judges Commissions and Patents; and having likewise taken all their Horses, they went away and marched towards Pool. A Rising in Shrop∣shire. At the same time a second party of these Ri∣sers did endeavour to surprize the Town and Castle of Shrewsbury, but being discovered, their design failed. A Rising in Mont∣gomery. In Montgomeryshire eight hundred men got to a head, which marching backwards and for∣wards, daily increased; and committed all kinde of Acts of Hostility. A Rising in Not∣tingham∣shire. There likewise came tydings from Notting∣hamshire, that a party of five hundred Horse had been seen together in Sheerwood Forest, with several Carts laden with Ammunitions; who making an halt at an Inn which was scituated from the Road, to consult on their Business, were seized with a Pannick fear: and no one of their Enemies appearing or pursuing them, they cryed out that they were betrayed; and so be∣took themselves to their heels, some one way some another, in a confused manner. A Rising framing in Northum∣berland. So likewise did Collonel Lilburn send word out of Northumberland, that they were busie in framing of a party there also, but that they had dissipated themselves through their own Fears and Jealousies.
A rising in York-shire. Finally, in Yorkeshire, Sir Henry Slingsby, and Sir Richard Maleverer had also assembled some Forces to have seized the City of York, having two Cart-loads of Ammunition with them, but they dispersed themselves on their own accompt, seeing but little appearance to suc∣ceed in their designe; Sir Henry Slingsby was ta∣ken and Imprisoned, and afterwards Beheaded upon another accompt. Wagstaff defeated and Pen∣ruddock and others executed. The first party commanded by Wagstaff and Penruddock was defeated by Captain Ʋnton Crook, at a place called South-melton; some whereof were killed and others were taken, who were Tried and Condemned; and those which dyed of note were Mr. Lucas, Thorpe, Kensey, Graves, and Penruddock, Sir Joseph Wag∣staff had the hap to make his escape and to get away. Royalists sent tofor∣reign Plantati∣ons. Moreover a little afterwards to rid the State of such like Incendiaries and Firebrands, the se∣veral Prisons and Goals of England were de∣livered from the Royalists, which were detained prisoners on the foregoing accompts, who were sent away to the Plantations and Collonies in America. The In∣surrecti∣ons all dissipated. In like manner, the rest of the other risings before mentioned, were quelled and dissipated, which both struck a terror in those who had not as yet shewn themselves, and restored peace and quietness to the State. A Spanish Ambassa∣dor sent over to his HighnessBy this time the subtil Spaniard, whose quaint policy doth for the most part hug the prospe∣rous, and destroy the miserable and distressed,
seeing that Fortune did daily more and more in∣cline to favour his late Highness the Lord Pro∣tector, that his Vigour and Force increased by opposition, and that the sole resplendency of his glory dissipated all those fogs and mists which endeavoured to obscure it, thought it meet to court England, and to endeavour to engage this State in his interests, in which was omitted no proffers which a Puissant Monarch could pos∣sibly make unto a Prince, whose Power was but as it were in the bud, and beginning to sprout forth. To which purpose the Marquis of Leda arived at London in the quality of an extraordinary Ambas∣sador to his late Highness; where he was received with all the Demonstrations of Honour and Pomp. But his late Highness being over-sensible of all those gross injuries which the Spanish Na∣tion for several years together have committed against the English, and also against all Europe besides; and being not willing to conforme his Maximes with the tyrannical and unjust princi∣ples of the Spaniards, returned civil and cere∣monious Answers to the said Ambassadors Pro∣posals; who returned back again very speedily with all sorts of contentment and satisfaction, save onely to that which he chiefly expected and most of all insisted upon. And England being at that present time in a peaceable posture, the Almighty having Crowned his late Highness the Lord protector with several signal Victories and Deliverances of his person from an infinite num∣ber of Dangers, his Highness thought he could not in a better wise express his acknowledge∣ments
Motives inducing his late Highness to a Breach with Spain. for so many mercies, then by the imploy∣ing of all his Care and Forces to oppose and beat down the Ambition (nay I may justly say, their Sacraledge and Impiety) and Avarice of the Spaniards, since it onely belongs to a God to Stile himself the Universal Monarch; who at the expence and charge of an hundred thousand Murders and Devastations, have rendred them∣selves Masters of the whole worlds Treasures. And withall, totally to extripate and root up the profound plots and devices which the Spa∣niards had long since laid in England to become Masters thereof; or at least to breed divisions in it at their own pleasures. Nor shall I need to enlarge upon the ambitious and cruel designes of that invincible Armado of Philip the Second, which was to have invaded England, and to have made it swim in its own Blood; nor of those several entreagues and policies which Spain hath hatched in Ireland, by assistances of men and monies; as also by their several Conspira∣cies in England, abusing of the Religion and blind zeal of some particular persons there: I shall onely begin with Gundamore that arch Ma∣chiavilian Spanish Ambassador, who had gained such a Credit and Power in the Court of Eng∣land, as that when he pleased he could dispose of the Lives of the greatest and best men in the State, when he had discovered they were his Ma∣sters Enemies: I shall onely instance in one, that admirable personage Sir Walter Rawleigh, who by reason he had undertaken to visit their Treasures in Hispaniola, and had Committed
some hostillities in those Seas in former time, Gundamore never left importuning of King James (whom he had in a manner bewitched) till he had obtained his death, and thus be∣reaved England of one of the great Poli∣ticians and Universallest men that ever this Isle brought forth; leaving us a testimony of his vast knowledge and experience, to wit, his famous History of the World. From hence his late Highness resolved to begin his just War against the proud Spaniard, and to sacrifice to the memory of this great Captain (and one of the most experienced Sea-men of all the World) all the Spanish Blood which the valour of the noble English hath so generously by way of re∣taliation drawn and let out since his late High∣ness's expedition against them. There are some friends with whom a man is forced to break off all friendship, because they will be too much our friends; that is, because they over-act the part of friendship by prying too deep into our Affairs and Designes, and by interesting themselves too far into the concern∣ments of those who depend on us, as that there∣by they steal away their hearts from us; and such like friends have the Spaniards been to England, who buy their friendships at such cheap rates, as that they feed those who side with them onely with imaginary speculations here on earth, making them eternally miserable; and with specious promises in the world to come, which would be obtained at cheaper and more assured rates without the interposing of their Hippocri∣tical and Ambitious trains.
But to return to our History again, his late Highness whose Genius affected the greatest dif∣ficulties, and the most extraordinary and rarest Designs, fix'd his thoughts upon New Spain; not to bereave them of their Treasures, which are with more ease to be interrupted at their coming home, but to revenge all Europe, unto whom the Jealous humor of the Spaniards de∣nies Traffique and Commerce into those parts; having at all times exercised unheard of Cruel∣ties and horrible Treacheries on such as were driven into those parts accidentally and forci∣bly by storms and tempests; or such as were by themselves, under the notion of friendship and kinde entertainment, drawn in thither to trade with them; whom they tyed stark naked unto trees, placing this Writing on their Breasts, Who sent for you hither? And in this wise suffered them to be eaten up alive by the Fowls of the Air, and the wilde Beasts of the Field. The His∣paniola expeion And the better to accomplish this Design, on the twenty seventh of December, 1654 a gal∣lant Fleet manned with brave Sea and Land-men, and well furnished with all kinde of Provi∣sions and Ammunitions of War, set sail from Portsmouth Road under the Command of the Generals, Penn and Venables, upon a Design which was not made publick. On the first of May 1655. news was brought that they were arrived at the Barbadoes on the twenty eight of January, where they had seized eighteen Holland Mer∣chant-men, which traffiqued in those parts con∣trary to the Ordinance of the long Parliament,
prohibitting the same. And by Letters of a fresher date, that they set sail from Barbadoes on the thirtieth of March towards Hispaniola. Where being arrived, by an unfortunate excess of prudence, the Commanders not deeming it fit to make a too near descent unto Sancto Do∣mingo in Hispaniola, (which notwithstanding was deserted by all the Garrison at the very sight and appearance of so considerable a Fleet) landed their men somewhat lower; that so, du∣ring the time the Spaniards should come to im∣pead their descent, they might have liberty to disimbark all their men, and to refresh them∣selves of the toils of the Sea. But this landing so far from the place, and deferring of the at∣tempt, put a new life and courage into the Spa∣niards, who repossessed their place again; ima∣gining that the English being unaccustomed to the excessive Heats of that Climate, and the deepness of the Sands, would be infinitely tyred in their March; and that by the said means they should be able to repulse and withstand them at a very cheap rate; which fell out just as the Spaniards had foreseen it: for the Climate was so hot and the Sands so deep, as that the English after their long march were not able to fight, were put to flight, and enforced to march back again to their ships, not without some dif∣ficulty; however, being seconded by fresh and vallant Sea-men, who went on shore to bring them off, they got on board again. And that their long voyage and course might not prove totally useless and unprofitable, they
Jamaica attempted and carri∣ed. resolved to set upon the Island of Jamaica, where they arrived on the tenth of May next ensuing; and after a little resistance which was made by the Spaniards, they became Masters of the place, which they have ever since preserved and kept with a great deal of constancy and glory, as we shall see hereafter. And that the English valour might be ren∣dred more considerable and formidable to the whole World, the Almighty inspired into them that Religious Design, to revenge the Christi∣ans wrongs and sufferings against the Profana∣tions and Abuses of the Turkish Barbarians, and crowned their pious attempt with as holy and glorious a Victory. General Blake de∣mads satis∣faction for wrongs sustained. Wherefore, General Blake having cast Anchor before Tunnis on the eighteenth of April, 1655 sent unto the Dy of the place, to demand satisfaction for some Eng∣lish ships which the Pyrats of those parts had carried away, and the liberty of the English Slaves they had detained. But it was refused with scorn and derision, the Turks making this Answer, Behold our Castles of Galetta, and our Castles and Vessels of Porto Ferino, do your worst against them, and do not think to brave us with the sight of your great Fleet. Whereupon, Ge∣neral Blake being sensible, that the Glory of God, and the Honour of the English Nation was concerned in the punishing of so great a disdain; and to let the Enemies of Christ and Christianism see, That they can do all things in and through him their strength and fortress, he called a Councel of War, rather to implore the Al∣mighties
assistance towards the compassing of so glorious a Design, then to resolve on the per∣forming it. Each one finding himself animated and armed with a more then naturall cou∣rage, to let those Infidels and all the World see, That the English are none of the least zealous in the Concernments of Christ; and so joyntly re∣solved by all means possible to burn nine of their men of War which lay in Porto Ferino, which was performed in the manner following. General Blake at∣tempts the Turks for∣tresses and navy. The Sea-shore was lined by one hundred and twenty peeces of Cannon, and the Port was de∣fended by the Castle, on which twenty peeces were mounted, besides some other small Forts which were also defended by great Guns and Musquet shot: However, it was resolved, That the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rere-Admiral should approach within musquet shot of the Castle, and there come to an Anchor, and in∣cessantly fire upon the Castle and other Forts, whilst the rest of the Fleet should second and back the Fire-ships and long Boats which were designed to fire the Ships in the Port. And the Almighty did evidently manifest as well in the hearts of the men, as by the blowing of the Winde, that he bare a part in this undertaking; so favourable was the Winde to the English, and so much were their courages animated by his Grace and Spirit: therefore in less then four hours time the said nine Ships were burnt down to their very Keels, the English for their part losing but five and twenty men which were slain, and eight and forty wounded. Whereupon, the
King of Tunis sought to the English for their friendship, and restored all the Prisoners for lit∣tle or nothing: amongst which, divers Dutch also obtained their liberty amongst the English, not being distinguished by the Turks. And one of the English Admirals who went ashore to redeem the Captives, was highly honoured and treated; all which sufficiently recompensed the disdain they harboured against the Valour and Piety of the English. Nor had these bold and glorious attempts sufficiently blazed the Vertue and Fortune of our late Protector, had they not continually been assailed by intestine Conspiracies which rose one on the back of the other, like unto so many Surges of the Sea, but which brake them∣selves in like manner upon a small shelf of Sand, on which the finger of God had worked their limits which they durst not exceed. A fourth conspiracy suspected. Thus on the twelfth of June in the same Year, the Lords, Willoughby of Parham, and Newport, Mr. Sea∣more, and Mr. Newport, with some others, were sent Prisoners to the Tower of London, on suspi∣cion of intermedling and assisting in a new Con∣spiracy. A Relief sent to Ja∣maica in twelve ships. But to the end that evil might be repayed with good, and that the Sun might be heightned in its heat at the same time that the mists and fogs did thicken to obscure it, his Highness sent twelve good men of War, well manned, with Collonel Humphreys his Regiment to boot, and well provided with all necessaries, as well to re-inforce the Naval Army as the Land Forces in
Jamaica; which Fleet set sail on the second of July next ensuing, and in convenient space of time arived safely at their designed Port. General Pen re∣turns to England. Within a moneth after which, General Pen arrived in England, having left the best part of the Fleet in those parts under the Command of Vice-Admiral Goodson, a very valiant and expe∣rienced Sea-Commander, and the Troops which had mastered Jamaica under the Command of Collonel Fortescue. But as all prosperities are usually accompanied with some small Allayes of adversity, the Almighty suffering it to be so for our instruction and precaution, and to humble us in our highest transcendencies of Fortune; Wherefore the said Fleet having gained the height of the Havennas in the Isle of Cuba, the Paragon Frigot was fired by negligence, and perished in the flames with the greatest part of its Company and Mariners before she could be succoured or relieved. General Venables also retur∣ned. On the ninth of the moneth of September en∣suing, General Venables likewise returned from the Indies in the Frigot called the Marston-moor, in so weak and dejected a condition, that he was even at deaths door and nothing save the change of Air could possibly have saved him. Treaty and Peace with Sweden. Mean while, the sympathy which all great and couragious persons seem to have for each other, begat a desire in his late Highness to be in amity with the King of Sweden, and likewise the King of Sweden on the other side coveted the same thing; so that the noble Lord Bulstrode Whitlock, one of Englands Worthies, having
scarce his like for profound Knowledge and Sa∣gacity, after he had resided for the space of eight Moneths in Sweden, terminated his Embassy by a compleat Peace and glorious Alliance, which he had concluded between that Crown and England; and returned himself to bring the good tydings thereof. Now for the preservation of the Peace of this Commonwealth, his late Highness constituted several Major-Generals in the respective Coun∣ties thereof, whose Names are as followeth: viz. 1. For Kent and Surrey, Collonel Kelsey. Major Ge∣nerals constitu∣ted. 2. For Sussex, Hamshire, and Barkeshire, Col∣lonel Goff. 3. For Glocestershire, Wilts, Dorset, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwal, General Desborow. 4. For Oxfordshire, Bucks, Hertford, Cam∣bridge, Isle of Ely, Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk, the Lord Deputy Fleetwood. 5. For the City of London, Major General Skippon. 6. For Lincolnshire, Nottingham, Derby, War∣wick, and Leicestershire, Commislary General Whaley. 7. For Northamptonshire, Bedford, Rutland, and Huntington, Major Butler. 8. For Worcester, Hereford, Salop, and North-Wales, Collonel Berry. 9. For Cheshire, Lancashire, and Stafford∣shire, Collonel Wortley. 10. For Yorkeshire, Durham, Cumberland, VVestmerland, and Northumberland, the Lord Lambert.
11. For VVestminster and Middlesex, the Lieuetenant of the Tower. France seeks his Highness to perfect a Peace. At this time France on her side being jealous of the several applications, profers, and proposi∣tions which the Spaniards made unto England; to beget an alliance with us, began to be sensi∣ble that it was high time to think upon her own preservation, her navigation being quite ruined, her subjects divided by Civil Wars, and inte∣stine troubles, and her forreign Enemies as pow∣erful as ever, resolved at length to make an address to his late Highness for an Alliance of Peace. Besides, that his late Highness harboured a na∣tural aversness and hatred against the Spaniards, who time out of minde have alwayes been the implacable and cruel Enemies of England, Reasons inducing his late Highness rather to conde∣scend to an alli∣ance with France then Spain. as well as of all mankinde besides; and who under a fair pretence of Religion and Amity, endea∣vour to withdraw the Subjects of their Allyes, and make them swerve from their Allegiance and Fidelity, either by the powerful operations of money, gifts, and such like other bewitch∣ing inducements, rendring themselves the Ma∣sters of the peoples inclinations, when by their Valour they cannot overcome them in Battel, nor by force of Arms gain their Towns or For∣tresses. But his late Highness open vertue and magnanimous courage disdaining any Com∣merce with this kinde of insinuating and en∣treaguing Nation, the Lion being too noble to enter into association and communication with the Fox; The French policy did better
jump with his humor; and their manner in van∣quishing their Enemies in a pitch'd Battel, and forcing them upon the very Ramparts of their Fortresses, did better please and second his War-like vertue; and by whose good intelligence and communication, the English growing discipline could not choose but attain to a rare perfection; whereas the Spaniards might happily have poy∣soned them by their Wiles and Subilties, and have corrupted them by their Hipocritical false Alloy and Mettal. Besides that the Liberty which is granted by the French to those who are of a different opinion in the points of Religion, was a great inducement to move his Highness rather to incline to a peace with that Nation, since himself was ever so tender in matters of Religi∣on, as that he believed it did onely belong to the Almighty to force the Consciences of Men, at least to enlighten and inspire them by his Graces, which are onely capable to convince our reason. A Peace with France Conclu∣ded and Proclaim∣ed. Finally, The Articles of peace with France, which were so much traversed by the Spanish Faction, were concluded and signed by such Commissioners as his late Highness had there∣unto deputed; and on the other part by his excellency the Lord Bourdeaux Ambassador of France: and on the eight and twentieth day of the moneth of November next ensuing, the pub∣lication of the said Treaty was proclaimed first at White-hall by the Heralds of Arms, the sound of Trumpets, and other formalities accustomed on the like occasions; afterwards in the Palace-yard
at Westminster, and in the other usual pla∣ces in the City of London where such like Pro∣clamations are made; and on the self-same day it was also published at Paris with a general ap∣plause and joy, at least of the Merchants, who by the preceding misunderstanding between England and France were quite ruined; and who by this conclusion of peace, found not onely the Seas open and free for them to trade in, but that the English of their worst Enemies became their best friends; by causing a bundance to reign in their Rivers and Territories, and by begetting an assured Commerce and Navigation in all those Seas wherein the Navigation extended it self. Nor was the Lord Major of the City of Paris less glad then the poor Citizens, who all of them witnessed an equal joy and allacrity, finding themselves indulged by this Treaty of peace from breaking their Ember-weeks, their Lent, and Fasting dayes, (as they call them) since they would otherwise have been constrained (by rea∣son of the excessive rates which fish, butter, and cheese, and such other small ratable wares were grown to) to have kept more fasting dayes then the Roman Kallendar doth enjoyn them; which would have been a double Penance and an intol∣lerable mortification. From all which they were freed by this hap∣py Peace; and in acknowledgement whereof, the Guns and Chambers from the Market-place and Town-House called the Greve, as well as those from the Bastile or Tower, ecchoed forth the joy which the Monsieurs conceived of this forerun∣ner
of the peace and tranquillity which they have since enjoyed in the heart of their Domi∣nions, and the Victories and Conquests which they may yet atchieve by this happy Union, if their victorious and gallant Prince doth conti∣nue to accompany his Valour with those Ver∣tues, which are onely capable not onely to give him addition of Crowns, but also to preserve them. And lest I might insensibly out-slip my chief intent and purpose, and engage my self in the giving of you a Relation of the chiefest and most important Wars and Transactions of all Europe, should I recount unto you all the glorious Acti∣ons which have hapned since the Breach between England and Spain; in which our late Protector bare away all the share at Sea, and a very great part also by Land; as in our joynt Conquests in Flanders, and our particular ones in Lorain. I shall therefore contract my pen a little, and onely give you a Breviate of the chiefest Acti∣ons, remitting the Reader to the more ample Histories both of France and England, to per∣use the Relation of those Victories, wherewith Heaven hath blessed this Alliance for these late Years past: In which the mature deliberations and good Councels do more concern his late Highness, then the execution of those gallant Attempts which proceeded from them; al∣though in truth both the one and the other may well be attributed to his great prudence, and to those Blessings which it hath pleased the Al∣mighty to shower down upon his admirable
good fortune, of which take some few In∣stances. The de∣fence and good suc∣cess at Ja∣maica. It is apparent to all the world in what a man∣ner his late Highness provided for the preserva∣tion of Jamaica, notwithstanding all the force and attempts of Spain and the Indies, to free that Island again, although they never yet did set foot thereon, save to their own shame and confusion, having been driven thence again with the loss of all their Cannon and Baggage; and the which happened two several times, when as the Spaniards assembling all their Forces in the Indies, came and encamped themselves in the Island with two or three thousand men, had the time and opportunity to build and erect Forts, and for the space of some dayes to settle them∣selves: Notwithstanding which, the English as if they were but newly arrived from England to attempt a new Conquest of the Island, were constrained to imbark themselves and put to Sea again, the wayes being not passable by Land; and in that wise compassing the whole Island, they made their descent at the very place where the Enemies were encamped, and assailed them in their Forts and Breast-works with a far less number of men then theirs, and drave the Spa∣niards quite from them, and out of the Island, killing and taking several of their men, and re∣taining several of their great Guns and stately Standards as Trophies of their Victory.General Mounte∣gue his victory over the Spaniards at Sea. Nor shall I enlarge upon that glorious Victo∣ry obtained by General Mountegue over the Spaniards at Sea, which was the first that made
this entrance into that famous War, and gave the Spaniards to understand, that it would cost them far more to transport their Gold from the Indies to Spain, then to dig it out of the Mines, or to refine it: The ensuing Poem penned by one of the most exquisite Wits of England, upon that subject, may better suffice to satisfie the Reader of the gloriousness of the Fact, and the shaming Stile which it is described by, is more proper to express this Heroick Action, then my low and unpolished Prose, which might haply obscure and detract from the lustre and splendor of so brave an Exploit; wherefore I have thought fit to insert the Poem it self. Upon the present War with Spain, and the first Victory obtained at Sea. Now for some Ages had the pride of Spain, Made the Sun shine on half the World in vain; While she bid War, to all that durst supply The place of those, her Cruelty made dye. Of Nature's Bounty men forbare totaste, And the best Portion of the Earth lay waste. From the New World, her Silver and her Gold; Came like a Tempest, to confound the Old. Feeding with these the brib'd Elector's Hopes, She made at pleasure Emperors and Popes: VVith these, advancing her unjust Designs, Europe was shaken with her Indian Mines. VVhen our Protector looking with disdain Ʋpon this gilded Majesty of Spain;
And knowing well that Empire must decline, Whose chief support, and sinews, are of Coyn: Our Nation's sollid vertue, did oppose To the rich Troublers of the World's repose. And now some moneths encamping on the Main, Our Naval Army had besieged Spain. They that the whole Worlds Monarchy design'd, Are to their Ports by our bold Fleet confin'd: From whence our Red Cross they triumphant see, Riding without a Rival on the Sea. Others may use the Ocean as their road, Onely the English make it their abode: Whose ready Sails with every Winde can flie, And make a covenant with th'unconstant Skie. Our Oaks secure, as if they there took root; We tread on Billows with a steady foot. Mean while the Spaniards in America, Near to the Line, the Sun approaching saw; And hop'd their European Coasts to find Clear'd from our ships, by the Autumnal Winde. Their huge capacious Gallions stuft with Plate, The laboring winds drives slowly towards their fate. Before Saint Lucar they their Guns discharge, To tell their Joy, or to invite a Barge. This heard some Ships of ours, though out of view, As swift as Eagles to the quarry flew. So heedless Lambs which for their mothers bleat, Wake hungry Lions, and become their meat. Arriv'd, they soon begin that Tragick play, And with their smoakie Cannon banish day: Night, horror, slaughter, with confusion meets, And in their sable Arms imbrace the Fleets.
Through yielding Planks the angry Bullets fly, And of one Wound hundreds together dye. Born under different Stars, one Fate they have, The Ship their Coffin, and the Sea their Grave. Bold were the men, which on the Ocean first Spread their new Sails, whilst shipwrack was the worst, More danger now from men alone we find, Then from the Rocks, the Billows, or the Wind. They that had sail'd from near th' Anartick Pole, Their Treasure safe, and all their Vessels whole; In sight of their dear Countrey ruin'd be, Without the guilt of either Rock or Sea. What they would spare, our fiercer Art destroyes, Excelling storms, in terror and in noise. Once Jove from Hyda did both Hoasts survey, And when he pleas'd to Thunder, part the Fray: Here Heaven in vain that kinde Retreat should sound, The louder Canon had the thunder drown'd. Some we made Prize while others burnt & rent, With their rich Lading to the bottom went. Down sinks at once (so Fortune with us sports) The Pay of Armies, and the Pride of Courts. Vain man, whose rage buries as low that store, As Avarice had digg'd for it before. What Earth in her dark bowels could not keep From greedy hands, lies safer in the Deep: Where Thetis kindly doth from mortals hide, Those seeds of Luxury, Debate, and Pride. And now into her lap the richest Prize Fell, with the Noblest of our Enemies. The Marquis glad to see the fire destroy Wealth, that prevailing Foes were to enjoy:
Out from his flaming Ship his Children sent, To perish in a milder Element. Then laid him by his burning Ladies side, And since he could not save her, with her dy'd. Spices and Gums about them melting fry, And Phenix-like, in that rich nest they dye. Death bitter is, for what we leave behinde, But taking with us, all we love, is kinde. VVhat could he more then hold for term of life, His Indian Treasure, and his more priz'd VVife? Alive, in flames of equal Love, they burn'd, And now together are to ashes turn'd. Ashes more worth, then all their Funerals cost, Then the huge Treasure which was with them lost. These dying Lovers, and their floating Sons, Suspend the Fight, and silence all our Guns. Beauty and Youth, about to perish, findes Such noble pitty in brave English mindes; That the rich Spoil neglecting, and the Prize, All labour now to save their Enemies. How frail our Passion's? how soon changed are Our wrath and fury to a friendly care? They that but now to gain the Spanish Plate, Made the Sea blush with Blood, forget their Hate; And their young Foes, while sinking, they retrive, VVith greater danger then they fought, they dive. VVith these returns Victorious Mountague, VVith Laurel in his hands, and half Perue. Let the brave General divide that bough, Our great Protector hath such Wreaths enough. His conquering Head hath no more room for Bayes, Then let it be as the whole Nation prayes:
Let the rich Oare forthwith be melted down, And the State fixt, by making him a Crown: VVith Ermins clad, and Purple; let him hold A Royal Scepter, made of Spanish Gold. Take the particulars of the Fight briefly thus: The Spaniards were seven in number, richly la∣den, about nine Leagues from Cadiz, coming from the West Indies; one whereof was burnt another sunk, two run aground, two were taken, one got away, with a Portugal Prize. In the ship that was burnt was the Marquis of Badex, his Wife, and one Daughter. In one of the ships taken, was the young Marquis his Brother, and another Sister, who was set on shore in Spain. The two Brothers were brought to England with a great deal of wealth. General Blakes de∣stroying the Spa∣nish Fleet at the Ca∣naries. And amongst these Victories which were gain∣ed at Sea against the Spaniards since the breach of the Peace, that which was obtained by Ge∣neral Blake at Sancta Cruza, in the Island of Teneriff, on the twentieth day of April, 1657. was none of the least; in which Port there was sixteen great Vessels burnt and sunk by the Eng∣lish; and the Spaniards Forts and Castles of the Isle, amidst which there were five or six great Gallions, the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and Rere-Admiral, the greatest part whereof were mount∣ed with Brass Ordnance, and laden some with rich merchandizes from the Indies, and the others with provisions and other manufactures to be transported thither, equipied in ample manner both with Soldiers and Mariners.
All which having their Flags, Ensignes, and Streamers flying, were set upon by the Eng∣lish, who in less then four hours time destroyed them all without the loss of above sixty men; the greatest part of which were killed by the Musquet shot which played from the shoar: But in lieu of them, the English with their Can∣non killed a great number of the Spaniards in their Breast-works and Forts. Wherefore his late Highness who never re∣compensed vertuous and magnanimous actions which bare praise, sent a civil Letter of thanks to General Blake, with a Diamond Ring valued at five hundred pounds, and gave the Captain that brought the news one hundred pound for a pre∣sent. Moreover, according to his accustomed Piety, be ordained a day of publick Prayer and Thanksgiving to be set apart, to return all Thanks, Acknowledgements, Praise, and Glory to the Almighty, for this so happy and signal a success; and to supplicate his Divine Bounty to bestow frequent and like Blessings upon the English Armadoes and Land Forces. But the Sea being a Theater or Stage too un∣stable for so settled a valour and constant aFor∣tune, the traces and marks which she receives of Combates and Victories are too soon worn out, and scare leave unto History, and to the memory of men, wherewith to raise Monu∣ments, erect Triumphs, and to transmit unto posterity the truth of things; and although that vertue be the more glorious, by how much the greater dangers it assails and surmounts; yet
however, as a flight is more easily made by Sea then by Land, where seldome men fight at hand-blows, we have reason to give the first praise and honour to that Element which first brought us forth, and whence we reap the most beneficial necessaries towards our subsistence. In like manner, his late Highness's solid policy was imployed on such solid foundations where it might lay deep rooting, and spread its large branches far and near without the apprehension of being sapped or dug up. May. 4. 1657. The English joyn with the French in Flan∣ders un∣der Sir John Rey∣nolds. The French therefore being desirous to be re∣venged for their ill success at Valenchenes, re∣solved the next summer to assault Montmedy, a strong Frontier seated upon a Rock; but being not strong enough to keep the Spaniards in play in Flanders, they separated part of their Army to prosecute the said siege; and the English began to make their first landing in Flanders, Sir John Reynolds was chosen by his late High∣ness to command the Body of the English For∣ces, consisting in six thousand Foot, who happily landed in Picardy about the latter end of May. And that it may not seem to be a digression from my subject, I shall omit the particulari∣zing of the siege, and the taking of Montmedy, and shall onely tell you, that the Marshal De la Ferte, who carried on that siege, was not at all incommodated by the Enemy from without, during the whole siege; nor durst the Spaniard ever set upon the French Army, thereby to at∣tempt the relief of that place. And although it would be a piece of injustice to dispoil that war-like
nation of their glory, yet all men know that their Army wanted Foot extreamly that Sum∣mer; but the English foot (which we must con∣fess is the best in all Europe) being joyned to their Cavalrie, (which also excel all others) there had not a more resolute and gallant Army been seen in France for many years together. His High∣ness In∣stallment in the Prote∣ctorship. And here by the way take notice of the In∣stallment of his late Highness in the Protector∣ship, which was on this manner, viz. On the twentieth day of the moneth of June, in the year of our Lord God 1657. being appointed for the Installment of his late Highness the Lord Protector; a large and spacious place was rai∣sed at the upper end of Westminster-Hall under the great window, in the midst whereof, a Rich Cloath of State was set up, and under it a Chair of State was placed upon an ascent of two de∣grees, covered with Carpets; before which stood a Table with a Chair appointed for the Speaker of the Parliament. On each side of the Hall, upon the said Structure there were seats raised one above each other, and decently cover∣ed for the Members of the Parliament; and be∣low them there were Seats made for the Judges of the Land on the one side, and for the Alder∣men of the City on the other side. About two of the Clock in the afternoon, his Highness met the Parliament in the Painted Chamber, and passed such Bills as were present∣ed to him; after which they went in order to the place appointed in Westminster-Hall: his Highness being entred on the place, and stand∣ing
under the Cloath of State, Mr. Speaker did in the Name of the Parliament, present several things which lay ready on the Table, unto his Highness, viz. A Robe of Purple Velvet, lined with Er∣mines, being the habit, anciently used at the so∣lemn Investure of Princes; next a large Bible richly Gilt and Bossed; and lastly a Scepter of massie Gold; which being thus presented, Mr. Speaker came from his Chair, took the Robe and therewith vested his Highness, being assist∣ed by the Earl of Warwick, the Lord Whitlock, and by others; which being done, the Bible was delivered to his Highness; after which Mr. Speak∣er girt about him the Sword; and finally delive∣red his Highness the Scepter; which being thus performed, Mr. Speaker returned to his Chair, and administred the Oath to his Highness which had been prepared by the Parliament for him to take. His Highness standing thus adorned in Prince∣ly State, Mr. Manton, by prayer recommended his Highness Forces by Sea and Land, the whole Government and People of these Nations, to the blessing and protection of God Almighty. After which, the people gave several shouts, and the Trumpets sounding, his Highness sate down in the Chair of State, holding the Scepter in his hand; and whilst his Highness thus sate, a Herald of Arms stood aloft, making a signal to a Trumpet to sound three times; after which, by direction and Authority of Parliament, he did there publish and proclaim his Highness, Oliver
Lord Cromwel, Lord Protector of England, Scot∣land, and Ireland, and the Dominions thereto be∣longing. Hereupon the Trumpets' sounded again, and the People gave several Acclamations, with loud shouts, crying, God save the Lord Protector. After a little pause, the Ceremony being en∣ded, his Highness saluting the Ambassadors, and publick Ministers, proceeded thence in his Princely Habit, (the Train whereof was borne up by six noble persons) and passed through the Hall into the Palace-yard, the Earl of War∣wick, carrying the sword before him, where his Highness entred into his Coach, attended by his Life-guards and Halberdeirs; the Officers of State; the Lord Major and Aldermen; all which waited on his Highness back to White-Hall; the whole Ceremony having been ma∣naged with State and Magnificence, suitable to so high and happy a Solemnity. Mardike taken by the Eng∣lish and French. But to return to our History again, toward the end of the Summer therefore, the united Forces of England and France took the Fort of Mardike, whereof Major General Morgan took possession for the English, as the earnest of further Conquests. The Spaniard hereupon con∣ceived all the fears and jealousies which so dan∣gerous a neighbour-hood might justly cause, which obliged them in the following moneth to resolve vigorously to assault the place, and to carry it by force: But they were received with The Spa∣niards re∣pulst at Mardike. so much vigour by the English, as that they were manfully beaten off, and constrained to retire with a great loss of their men, and of several Of∣ficers of note.
General Blake dyes in sight of Plimouth. But the joy of these successes were modera∣ted by the death of Admiral Blake, a person who had so well deserved of England, as that he may be justly intituled its Neptune, at the same time when as his Highness was its Jupiter and Mars; who caused him to be buried with all the Demonstrations of Honour due to his high demerits. He came within sight of Plimouth onely to give up the Ghost, and received this satisfaction at his death, to have bestowed all the Moments of his life on that Element which had given him so much glory; just like unto Moley Moluch that Illustrious King of Fess, who at the Article of Death, caused himself to be carried in a Litter into his Camp, where he expired in the middle of the Battel, as he was exhorting his Soldiers, and gained the Victory. In like manner dyed General Blake in the midst of his famous Combats and Victories, regret∣ted by all England; and his late Highness, who had alwayes an especial care to cause those ho∣nours to be rendred to such great persons as were due to their demerits, would have him stately interred, as the Earl of Essex had been before; but General Blakes body was onely brought with a Naval Pomp by Water in State on the Thames from Greenwich to Westminster, as being a more suitable Ceremony to his im∣ployment; and was there buried in Henry the Seventh's famous Chappel. Now the Spaniards disgusted at the firme footing the English had both gotten and kept at Mardike, conceiving that against the next
The Spa∣niards re∣pulse a∣gain from before Mardike. Spring it might give them a greater in-let in Flanders, deemed they had best to endeavour the driving of them thence betimes, before they should be too well settled and established there; they resolved to assault them again, and accord∣ingly did set upon them very vigorously and re∣solutely with a party very considerable, com∣manded by the pretended Princes of England, and the Marquis of Coracene; but the English defended themselves so manfully and stoutly, as that the Spaniards began to judge that as the French are good at taking of places, so the Eng∣lish were constant in keeping and defending them; insomuch as that my Dons were forced to return by weeping cross to Dunkirk, and take their last farewell of Mardike. St. Venaut taken by the Eng∣lish. For they might very well have perceived by the business of St. Venant, that the English were as good at the one as at the other; when as the Spaniards having besieged Ardres, the English supposed that their advance into France was onely to retard their progress into Flanders, gave so resolute an assault to St. Venant, as that they carryed the place and had the sole honour of it; and immediately marching towards Ar∣dres, they drove away the Spaniards then with so much courage and resolution as amazed the French. Wherefore this latter part of the sea∣son having been imployed in sowing the seeds of those Laurels which they were to reap in the next years expedition in Flanders. His late Highness recollected himself, to esta∣blish Peace and Tranquility in England, and to
settle the foundation of a happy and glorious Government. The Lord Henry Cromwel made de∣puty of Ireland. And deeming that he could not more justly confer the eminent dignities of the Land, save upon those who together with their blood had sucked from him the seeds and buds both of Mi∣litary and Politick Vertues; he created his younger son the Lord Henry Cromwel, Lord De∣puty of Ireland; who hath alwayes and doth still behave himself with so much conduct and applause in this so eminent a charge, as that en∣vy it self is constrained to confess, that his Fa∣thers wisdome could not have made a better choice. Much about this time the Officers at Mar∣dike, in whose breasts the rigour of the winter did onely excite the heat of those designs which they had conceived in their souls, being desirous to imploy part of that unprofitable season to concourse and consult that Oracle of Prudence, who by the conduct of their Heroick Projects did inspire into them the vertue and efficacy to compass their designs, and to surmount even the greatest difficulties; Sir John Reynolds, I say, Sir John Reynolds and others drowned. Commander in chief, Collonel White, and some other Officers, being impatient to enjoy the happiness of seeing and consulting his High∣ness, embarqued at Mardike for England; but the mischance was, that being assailed by a tem∣pest, they were unfortunately cast away upon the Goodwin Sands, and so frustrated all the world of the expectations of those fair hopes which were conceived of their valours, and of so fortu∣nate beginnings.
On the fourth day of the moneth of Fe∣bruary then next ensuing, his late Highness re∣paired to the Lords House then in Parliament, and having sent notice thereof to the House of Commons by the Keeper of the Black-Rod, the Speaker with the Members came to the Lords House, where standing without the Bar, and his Highness within under a Cloath of State, being animated with his wonted vigour and resoluti∣on, succinctly told them without many pre∣ambles, The Par∣liament dissolved Febr. 4. 1657/8 That it concerned his Interest as much as the publike Peace and Tranquility, to termi∣nate this Parliament, so that he was come thi∣ther to dissolve the same, which was also imme∣diately performed. The City Militia settled a∣gain by his late High∣ness. On the twelfth day of the moneth of March ensuing, his late Highness being desirous to ob∣lige the City of London in a particular manner, and at the same time to witness unto them the care he took for their preservation and tran∣quillity; he sent for the Lord Major, the Al∣dermen, and the other Magistrates of the City, and having made them sensible of his tenderness and care for their good; he also represented unto them, that during the Calm, Tempests were most of all to be apprehended: so that at such times, the requisite Orders and necessary pre∣ventions to resist Troubles, were to be chiefly minded. For to this knowing and vigilant Spi∣rit, to whom nothing was dark or hid; this penetrating Light, who could pry even into mens hearts; and who from out of his Cabinet could discover the most secret Plots which were
hatching throughout all Europe, declared unto them, That the Enemies both of the State and of their City did not sleep, although it seemed they were quite lulled: That their City was great and vaste, and like unto a corpulent Body, nourished several ill humours: That he request∣ed them for their own goods to have a special care, and to bear a watchful eye: That he relied much upon their Vigilancy and Affection, and that all he could contribute thereunto on his be∣half, was to re-establish the City Militia, (which had been abolished through the disorder of the foregoing Wars) and to desire them to appoint for their Officers, persons of Honour and Probity, well-wishers and friends to the peace and quietness of the State and publique Good. Whereupon, the Lord Major and Offi∣cers having returned thanks to his Highness for so signal a Mark of his confidence and goodness towards them, proceeded to settle the Militia, and repayed him with all the Obedience and Fi∣delity, which a Magnanimous Prince could ex∣pect from Subjects, who were well versed in the duties they owed to a Governour, who had rid them of a world of miseries, and delivered them from the burthen of a Civil War. Nor was this precaution or forewarning of his late Highness without some grounds or foundation; A Con∣spiracy discovered for on the twenty fourth of the said Moneth, the quiet Serpent which hatched its poison under the green grass, unawares let slip a Hiss, whereupon an exact search was made throughout all London and Westminster for sus∣pected
persons, divers of which were secured and imprisoned. His late Highness knowing full well, that States are maintained, as well by Justice as by force of Arms, and that those chiefly stand in need of both, which through the divisions of Mens mindes, touching Spiritual concernments, seem to be in a continual ap∣prehension of those revolutions, which at all times have been caused in the World by the means of these diversities of opinions. His Highness I say through the cause of these ap∣prehensions, and the discoveries which were al∣ready made, as aforesaid, caused a High Court of Justice to be erected, A high Court of Justice erected. according as it had been decreed by an Act of Parliament, and settled under the great Seal of England: and truly it was high time for the Swords of Justice to ap∣pear to chastise the Conspirators, since the sparkles of their fury had spread themselves abroad through its veil, rather by their immo∣derate heat then their sad looks; several per∣sons of quality were imprisoned in the Tower of London; and within few dayes afterwards, just like unto a River, which is ready to disgorge it self into the Sea, appears great and violent at its entrance, so also the Conspiracy being just ready to break forth, appeared the more formi∣dable; and assured there were whole Regi∣ments enrolled; and in the midnight of May∣day they should have set fire on several parts of the City, and whilest the confusion and horror thereof had seized all men, they should have made a general Massacre of all those who would
have opposed their fury. His Highness like unto the Sun, elevated up to the highest Hea∣ven, peirced through all those other Sphears, which were darkned to all other Lights but his, and dissipated those Fogs and Mists, which the darkness of the Furies had spread over the City of London;The Plot prevented for on the morning of that fatal intended day, the Guards were doubled both within and without the City; and about five of the Clock in the Evening, both Horse and Foot were drawn up in Arms; the City Militia like∣wise keeping strong Guards all that night, to prevent and hinder so sad and horrid an at∣tempt. Several Conspira∣tors taken and sen∣tenced, some con∣demned, others par∣doned. Mean while, all care was taken to dis∣cover the Firebrands before they could enter upon their exploit; and as Enterprizes where∣in so many persons are engaged cannot remain very secret or hidden, about seven of the Clock that Evening, about forty of the Conspirators were taken and carried to White-Hall, and on the day following, several others of all kindes and conditions were also apprehended; as Gentlemen, Merchants, Souldiers, and the like; many of which were condemned to dye as Tray∣tors: but his late Highness was so merciful to pardon the most part of them, to the end that like unto a second Augustus he might gain by his Clemency those hearts which would not be mollified by the horror of the undertakings, nor the rigour and severity of the punish∣ments. On the second day of the moneth of June then next ensuing, there arrived a strange accident on
A Whale cast up in the Thames. the Thames near London, to wit, a Whale of a prodigious bigness, at least sixty foot, and of a proportionable breadth, was cast up. This great Fish, which may be stiled the King of the Sea for his bulk, came to do homage to his late Highness, and by his Captivity and Death, to to let him see he was absolute Master of that terrible Element which had given her a being. Dunkirk besieged by the Eng∣lish and French. But let us again return to the Wars in Flan∣ders, and let us see how whole Armies and Ci∣ties do there submit unto his Highness power, as well as the Sea Monsters here. Now although taking and keeping of Mardike had been a suf∣ficient warning to the Spaniards to provide the Town of Dunkirk with all necessaries to with∣stand a Siege, however that changed not the English their resolution to attempt it; where∣fore the United Forces both of France and England, under the Command of those two glorious Chieftains, his Highness the Martial of Tureine, Prince of Quesnoy, and his Excellency the Lord Ambassador and General Lockhart, besieged the place, opened the approaches, and with an incredible diligence perfected the Cir∣cum volution. The Spa∣niards at∣tempt to relieve Dunkirk. The Spaniards intending to at∣tempt the relief of the place, being the Key of all Flanders, and the chief Sea Port, assembled all their Forces, and made up a considerable Army of sixteen thousand men, with a design to have forced the Lines, and to have raised the Siege. To which intent, on the third of June they came in a Body through Fuernes, and encamped within an English mile and a half of the Martial
Tureines Quarters, who being aware of their intent, the following night brake up his Camp; and having left part of his Forces to make good the Approaches, and to guard the Trenches, marched all night with fifteen thousand men and ten peeces of cannon to encounter the Ene∣my, to decide in a pitched Battle and an open Field, with an equal advantage, which party should be victorious. The English Foot drawn up into four great Battalions, and led on by his Excellency the Lord Ambassador and General Lockhart, gave the first on-set upon five great Battalions of the Spanish Foot placed very advantagiously on three high and great Downs, feconded by Don John of Austria himself, and the best of the Spanish and Condean Forces, which they had purposely opposed unto the English, conceiving them to have been as yet Novices in the manner of waging War beyond Seas, and that for want of Discipline and Conduct they would soon have been routed and disordered: But they were suddenly deceived in their expectations, and found that they had to deal with persons of cou∣rage and resolution, who as well in the Military Discipline, as in the Art of Courtship, became perfect and absolue Masters even during their first years of Apprenticeship; wherefore it was not without reason the Ancients did alwayes joyn Mars and Venus together, since towards the doing of gallant Actions, it is sufficient to be passionate and resolute at the very entering into the Lists of either of these Divinities. The
English therefore assailing the Spaniards in their advantageous stand as aforesaid, in the high Downs, did themselves alone severall times charge them, and sustained both the burnt of their Horse and Foot, without ever being se∣conded or relieved by the French; who were so confident of their Resolution and Valour, as that they would not seem to intrench upon their Ho∣nour; besides that, they were loath to change their Stands, least thereby they might bring themselves into a disorder: The Spa∣niard bea∣ten by the English and French and finally, forcing the Spaniards to quit their stations, they put them to a total rout and confusion. In which Charge up the Downs, Lieutenant Collonel Fenwick, who shewed a great deal of Gallantry in leading on his Excellency the Lord Ambassa∣dor and General Lockharts Regiment of Blue, received his mortal wound by a Musquet bullet through the Body, whereof he dyed some few dayes after. Divers other persons of quality and note signallized themselves not a little that day at the Head of their respective Regiments; as the Honorable Collonel Lillingston, Lieute∣nant Collonel Fleetwood, Captain Devaux, who led up a Forelorn of three hundred Musquetiers, and gave the first Charge upon the Spaniards: And of the Voluntiers, Collonel Henry Jones, who at first charged with Lieutenant Collonel Fenwick on foot, afterwards on Horseback, when as engaging too far, he was taken prisoner, but was afterwards exchanged; and by his late High∣ness at his return into England, made Knight and Baronet. Divers others did gallantly, who
doubtless will not be forgotten in the English Annals, and would be too large to be expressed in this Epitome relating onely to his Highness. The Spaniards had at first resolved to have given no English man quarter, but the fortune of the day made them glad to seek to the Eng∣lish for quarter themselves; and it was well they could have it given them, although the English were generous enough to have spared their Lives, had not the zeal of overcoming, and their resolutions to perfect the Victory, ta∣ken up all their care and passions. Finally, the Spanish Foot being totally routed, and coming to surrender themselves to the English in whole troops, the English mistrusting they had some other intentions and stratagem thereby, nei∣ther understanding their Language nor designe, continued charging them, and enforced them to seek quarter elsewhere, preferring the gaining of the Victory to their own particular interests; and so reaped an intire glory in their despising and rejecting several prisoners of quality, who profered themselves to them, and for the which they might have had considerable ransoms. And in the gaining of those high Downs on which the Spaniards were placed, the English behaved themselves with so much gallantry and resolution, as that envy and malice raised a re∣port amidst the jealous and their Corivals, that it savoured more of a piece of rashness then of a true valour; as if Soldiers could possibly with too much zeal and readiness performe those Commands which are given them.
To be brief, the victory wholly declared it self for the English and for the French, and the whole Spanish Army was quite discomfited and pursued to the very Gates of Fuernes, with the loss of three thousand five hundred men, two thousand whereof were killed on the place of Suydcote, a Village seated in the Downs between Dunkirk and Fuernes; and the rest were taken prisoners, and the whole Army dissipated and disordered: which defeat having quite disheart∣ned the besieged, and depriving them of all hopes of relief, besides their Govornour the Mar∣quis De Leda being mortally wounded by two hand Granadoes as he defended the false bray, and of which wounds he dyed, constrained them to beat a Parley fourteen dayes afterwards, and to surrender the place on the fifteenth of July 1658. after the one and twentieth day of the opening of the Approaches. Dunkirk taken and possessed by the English. And in this man∣ner this famous Sea-port was reduced under the obedience of his late Highness the Lord Pro∣tector, and was by the French put into the hands of his Excellency the Lord Ambassador and General Lockhart, who was by his High∣ness declared Governour of the same; and took possession of it with four English Regiments which compose the Garrison thereof, and serve to defend the Fort Mardike, and the new Fort Royal, begun by the Spaniards on the Channel of Burges, and perfected by the English, now called Olivers Fort. The Inhabitants of which place are so much taken with the superabundan∣cy of the generosity and goodness of their said
Governour his Excellency the Lord Lockhart, as that they repent themselves to have so much list∣ned to the Spanish false perswasions and fears, which they possessed them with, that they should be cruelly and inhumanely treated by the Eng∣lish, purposely to make them resist the longer. It had been well they had had so much care of their Souls, as they perswaded them they had of their Goods and Fortunes. But it would be too great a conquest to pre∣tend joyntly to overcome both the Consciences of men and their Town to boot; the first is Gods due, and the other Caesars. And we may observe in Alexander the Great, whensoever his Forces became Master sof any place, he would alwayes sacrifice to the Gods of the Countrey; thereby to gain the Inhabitants hearts, and to in∣duce their Gods to become propitious to him. Numa Pompilius was a King before he was a Priest, and although the Almighty hath imprin∣ted in all men a particular inclination to adore him, yet however as concerning the manner of worshipping him, Policy alwayes preceded Re∣ligion, and ever kept the upper hand over her as much as she possibly could. King Henry the Fourth of France was a Pro∣testant whilst he had overcome his Enemies, but as soon as he was settled in the Throne, and that he was to Reign as King, he seemingly returned Papist, and said, That the Kingdome of France and City of Paris was worth a going to Mass. But when as superstitious and zealous spirits coun∣selled him to prosecute and pursue the Prote∣stants,
he answered, That so long as they remain∣ed faithful and true to him, and continued to stand by and serve him as they were wont, he would be as much a Father and Protector unto him, as unto the rest of his good Subjects. These Maximes are general and common, and admit of no distincti∣ons save in Schools; nor need the Spaniards with all their Hypocrisie and Pious malice to doubt, but that France and England understand∣ing each other well enough, and that the Eng∣lish themselves are prudent enough to avoid that which may prejudice them, and to tol∣lerate whatsoever may advance and further their conquests, and beget a love and esteem of their government. But to return to our former subject again, as we have oft before alledged, the joyes of this World are alwayes for the most part mingled with some allayes of sorrow; the Al∣mighty being willing to keep us mindful that there are no perfect felicities to be enjoyed here on earth; and that its onely in heaven we are to expect an intire and perpetual Contentment and Bliss. Wherefore the Laurels of the Victo∣ry obtained against the Spaniards, and of the ta∣king of the Town of Dunkirk, were soon wither∣ed, and the joyes abated, by the interposing of the Cypress-tree which death planted upon the Tomb of the Illustrious and most generous Lady Cleypoll, second Daughter to his late Highness; The Lady Cleypolls death. who departed this mortal life to a more glorious and eternal one on the sixth day of August this present year: a fatal prognostication of a more sensible ensuing loss. For even as Branches of
trees being cut and lopped in an ill season, do first draw away the sap from the tree, and after∣wards cause the body thereof to dry up and dye; In like manner, during the declining age of his late Highness, an ill season, in which men usually do as it were reap all their consolation from the youth and vigor of their Children, wherein they seem to ruine by degrees as they draw near to their death, it unfortunately fell out, that this most illustrious Daughter, the true repre∣sentative and lively Image of her Father, the Joy of his Heart, the Delight of his Eyes, and the Dispenser of his Clemency and Benignity, dyed in the flower of her age; which struck more to his heart then all the heavy burthens of his Affairs, which were onely as a pleasure and pastime to his great Soul. So great a power hath Nature over the dispositions of generous Men, when the tye of Blood is seconded by love and vertue. This generous and noble Lady Eli∣zabeth therefore departed this World in despite of all the skill of Physicians, the Prayers of those afflicted persons whom she had relieved, and the vows of all kinde of Artists whom she cherished: But she dyed an Amazonian-like death, despising the Pomps of the Earth, and without any grief, save to leave an afflicted Fa∣ther perplex'd at her so sudden being taken away; she dyed with those good Lessons in her mouth, which she had practised whilest she lived. And if there be any comfort left us in her death, it is the hope we have, That her good Example will raise up the like inclinations in the remain∣der
of her Sisters whom Heaven hath yet left us. I shall not at all speak of her Funerals, for if I might have been credited, all the Muses and their God Apollo, should have made her an Epi∣cedium, and should have appeared in mourning, which should have reached from the top of their Mount Parnassus to the bottom of the valley thereof. But if this illustrious Personages death received not the Funeral Rites which all great Wits were bound to pay it, at least the Martial men did evidence, that the disgrace lay not at their doors, but that they ought to reap all the glory, since they were not backward to continue to brave and affront dangers in the behalf of an illustrious and glorious Cause: wherefore the sad tydings of this noble Personages death touched the gallant English to the heart, seeing they were bereaved of their English Pallas, and of their Jupiters Daughter; they therefore accu∣sed the Destinies for intrenching upon their Pri∣viledges, and evidenced, that it appertained not alone unto them to dispose of the lives of men. Their wrath therefore discharged it self on the first Objects which presented themselves to their eyes: and the harmless Spaniards were so many Victims offered up to this Amazons shrine; and as if Graveling had been her stake, they were so eagerly bent to fire the Enemies out of the same, Graveling taken by the French as that the Spaniards were constrained to open their gates to give vent to the fire and flame which suffocated them, and surrendered them∣selves to the Conquering French Army; to whose share that place fell, and by whose force it was solely gained.
As Physicians do agree that extreme Joy cau∣seth Death as well as excessive Grief, so may we likewise say, That both these violent Passions united together, must needs destroy the strong∣est person on earth; and that the Conflict which they produce in a Soul, is capable to turn the edge of the keenest weapons which are op∣posed to their resistance, and to make the fairest champain Field become a parched barren plat of Ground. But what need we to seek external Causes in a Death which brought along such violent ones with it, a Cardinal of Richelieu, who was one of the best Tempers and Constitu∣tions in the world, did fall under the burthen of the Anxieties and Agitations of the Mind. The scabbard (as the Proverb saith) being worn out by the sharpness of the blade, must of necessity finde a vent: And how could it otherwise chuse, that a Man who for the space of ten or twelve years together had opposed himself to all the Injuries both of Time and of War, should not at length fall under the activeness of a soul which seldom gave him any rest, which govern∣ed and directed the Reins of three restive King∣doms, unaccustomed to the noble and famous Trappings of a Military Government; and who moreover was to direct and guide the Consci∣ences as well as the Bodies of Men, and their Reasons as well as their Wills. It had not been considerable had the Interest of England onely required that his Cares had been limitted within the Pales which the Sea prescribes to her Pre∣cincts; But as the cause of the Disease was from
abroad, and that from the Closets of the Escu∣rial, the Spaniards had imployed their false Piety as well as their Peru Gold, to discover and mo∣lest the repose of England; so fire and flame was to be applied without, and it was necessary to penetrate into the very secret causes of the evils. The People of the Cities of the Conti∣nent were to be disabused, and the Soldiery were to be overcome in open field. The Mines of Mexico were to be looked into, and the extent of that Ambition was to be curtailed, which boasts it self both to see the Sun set and rise. These were vaste imployments indeed of a large activity, to run through these underta∣kings, the fervor of them was scorching; and although the Heavens did second these lawful Designes with all its Graces, yet it could not without a Miracle, and without destroying the secondary Causes, hinder the separation of a Soul from a Body which it had so often employ∣ed, and so efficaciously seconded the grand Af∣fairs both of State and War for the Peace, Glo∣ry, and Tranquillity of three Nations. Where∣fore Nature it self did witness her grief some two or three dayes before, by an extraordinary Tempest and violent gust of weather; insomuch that it might have been supposed, that her self had been ready to dissolve; or that the Master∣piece of Nature suffered a violent agitation. And as the Death of the Sun of Righteousness was foretold by an Eclipse of the Sun, which covered the surface of the whole Earth with Darkness: In like manner, at the death of the
People of Englands Hercules, both Force and Nature were let loose to shake the very Ele∣ments; and by the reuniting of their violence, like unto those who are ready to give up the Ghost, to leave some marks of an extream dis∣solution; all which is so lively set forth by the quaintest Wit of these times, as that I shall not inlarge any further upon this observation, Mr. E. Waller. but shall onely content my self to repeat unto you his Verses, who expresseth it more elegantly and copiously then my rough Prose can possibly reach to. Upon the late Storm, and his Highness death ensuing the same. We must resign, Heaven his great soul doth claim, In Storms as loud as his immortal fame. His dying groans, his last breath shakes our Isle, And Trees uncut fall for his Funeral Pile; About his Palace there broad roots were tost, Into the Air, so Romulus was lost. New Rome in such a tempest mist their King, And from obeying fell to worshipping. On Aetna's top, thus Hercules lay dead, With ruin' Oaks and Pines about him spread; Those his last fury from the Mountain rent, Our dying Hero from the continent. Ravish whole Towns and Forts from Spaniards reft, As his last Legacy to Brittain left. The Ocean which so long our hopes confin'd Could give no limits to his vaster minde: Our bounds inlargement was his latest toil,
Nor hath he left us Prisoners to our Isle. Ʋnder the Tropick is our Language spoke, And port of Flanders hath receiv'd our Yoke, From Civil Broyls he did us disingage, Found nobler objects for our Martial rage; And with wise conduct to his Countrey shew'd, Their ancient way of conquering abroad. Ʋngrateful then it were no tears allow, To him that gave us peace and Empire too: Princes that fear'd him grieve concern'd to see, No Pitch of glory from the Grave is free. Nature her self took notice of his death, And sighing swell'd the Sea with such a breath; That to remotest shores her billows rould, The approaching fate of their Great Ruler told. And truly I had need of all Parnassus his art to sweeten and mollifie the bitterness of this death, which causeth my pen to fall to the ground, and would cast up my Muse into a pitti∣ful swound, did not all the rest of the Muses come to her aid, and sprinkle her with some of that divine Water which nourisheth her, to make her revive again, and to restore her to her strength, to announce to posterity the time, the day, and the manner when and how his late Highness our great Oliver breathed his last. After his late Highness had therefore been sick about a fortnight of a Disease which at the beginning was but an Ague, on a Friday being the third of September 1658. in the Morning, he gave all the signs of a dying person, and for whom the Physicians had onely Vows and Pray∣ers
in reserve: However, he remained in that manner till about three of the Clock in the after∣noon, when as his Soul which had alwayes re∣tained the upper hand of his Body, preserved her Empire till the last moment; he had alwayes his wits about him, and his perfect and intire un∣derstanding, and continued to deliver those Oracles which were necessary to establish, after so great a loss, the Peace and Tranquility of England; and immediately to repair the ruines which so dangerous a dissolution had threatned the State withall, and might cause in the mindes of every particular person. His greatest and most important care was to name a Protector to be his successor, which he did with Reasons so little savouring of his own interests and worldly concernments, as that he testified, that being not content to have sacri∣ficed himself for the common good by the short∣ning of his dayes, he was willing to consecrate his Children thereunto, by the lading of them with the heavy burden of those weighty myste∣ries, which may well be termed a Royal and Gilt Servitude. Which succession was so necessary to the Peace and Tranquility of the State, that the Common-wealth and the Elective Kingdoms are con∣strained to imitate it; and the successive Mo∣narchies have oftentimes done more with a yong Prince in a Cradle, hung betwixt two Trees in the midst of their Camp, then they would have done by the Orders and the Examples of the most expert Captains: But when as the Age,
Experience, and Deserts of a Son do unite and combine in the Love and Memory of the vertues of a Father, what shall not betide so wise and worthy a choice? and what shall not be thence expected? For who can with more reason hope to be feared, loved, and obeyed by a whole Nati∣on, save the worthy Heir of him, who hath rendred them so formidable, and who hath ru∣led over, and governed them so tenderly and meekly? How should unavoidable and strange changes have been prevented, if domestick broils had not been shunned? and whom could we thave better met with the resemblance of a Fa∣ther, who never had his equal in Prudence, For∣tune, and Valour, save in a Son? Politicians and Nature delight in the diversi∣fying of their works; the one produceth few men alike, and the other delights in the condemn∣ing and destroying of the designs of those who have preceded them, to the end, that they may thereby shew their own good parts, and ra∣ther appear Originals then Copies. After the giving of these and like Orders, and the settling of the most important Concernments of the State, this great Personage gave up the Ghost, just like a man that falls asleep through the toil of a laborious task. The ensuing night was se∣rene and peaceful, like unto those who display their Sable Veil spangled with Stars, to deck and wrap up the Sun after its long and serious ardent Course. He died in the midst of his Victories and Tri∣umphs, after he had caused all the fair fruits
which shall be reaped for ever by England, as well in the Continent, as within the Circumfe∣rence of its Isles, to bud forth into Blossoms and Flowers. He dyed in a Bed of Bucklers, and on a Pillow of Caskets; and though the Wreaths of the Imperial Laurel which invironed his head did wither at the Groans of his Agony, it was onely to make place for a richer Diadem which was prepared for him in Heaven; and which must needs be more sumptuous and resplendent, in that it is ingrafted upon that Christian humi∣lity wherewith he did so constantly refuse a temporal Crown, which was due unto his de∣serts, and which was profered him several times by the People of England: and although he be dead, yet he is living, nay, triumphing, and pro∣nouncing Oracles to his very last Groans, most clear and intellegible Oracles; and as being in∣spired by the Spirit of the God of Truth, he dyed like a second Vespasian, who even on his Death-bed continued to enlarge the Bounds of his Empire, and as long as he had breath, ceased not to dispatch several Businesses of con∣sequence; answering the Physicians who repro∣ved him, as the Emperour did, That an Empe∣rour ought to dye standing. Truly it is a great comfort at the Article of death, to dye profita∣bly for Heaven, and for the good of ones Coun∣trey. But before we close his Eyes, let us once more reflect on the constancy wherewith he expects her last assaults, and with how much fear and trembling this inexorable one sets upon him
unarmed, and resolved to yield to her; and how∣ever she was accustomed to cast her darts before him, yet she is afraid, she trembles and hides her treacherous sythe, and never producing it till she sees her blow sure. How oftentimes ap∣proaching him in the heat of Battels, armed with despair and horrour, was she constrained to turn her back, and to serve him for an In∣strument of Victory, whom she was resolved to have laid along? How often hath she been seen to change colour, and to embrace the weaker party, to the end she might shew her force, and cut down a greater number of vi∣ctimes? Self-Interest is then made this insensible one grieve for those which she had rashly slain on Olivers side, she lost by their not being, since her sacrifices were there lessened, and that Olivers Arm alone was forced often to supply the ab∣sence of his companions, or their ill fortunes. But as the love of this step-dame was false, so likewise was it converted into rage as soon as his late Highness caused Peace to succeed War, and that he outvied this furious Hag by the un∣daunted courage; as then she brake off all intelli∣gence with force and horrour, and she raised up from Hell all the malicious and subtil Furies, both Envy and Treason came to her relief and aid; and by a sacrilegious Spell, she hath sought the Blood of Christ in the very Sacrament there∣of to compose her Poyson; and by abominable wit chcrafts she sowed sedition in the Hearts of the People; she bewitched the Wise, she blind∣ed the Nobles, and finally she therewith colour∣ed
and cloaked all her most black and horrid Designs. But on Oliver his late Higness, she could never fasten her baits, finding him alwayes armed with that Antidote which he renewed daily on the same Altars whence she sucked her venom. He alwayes opposed his Wisdom to her Craft, his Justice to her Violence, his Prayers to her Impieties, and his Clemency to her Obsti∣nacy. The Tempest invironed him on all sides, but he was in the Ark; his Enemies set upon him whilest he was asleep, but the Character of God which was imprinted in his Forehead, cau∣sed the Sword to fall out of their hands; and Goliah with his Legions of Philistines fell down at the sole report of his Sling. Finally, God hath made him to pass safe through the lifted up Waves of his Enemies, in which themselves were drowned; and in case the Sea did prove Red, God be praised it was not by his Blood, nor by the stains of his Soul which abhorred all kinde of Cruelty. For if the Pardons which he granted were put in an equal balance with the Deaths which happened during the time wherein his Power was as yet but limit∣ted, it would be found, that he did not alwayes give ear to the prudent Politician, to abandon himself from the meekness and generosity of his natural inclinations. Those who shall read the Histories of such like Revolutions as these, will finde that they never attained to so high a pitch of Grandor, by such meek and merciful means, and so void of passion. Wherefore his peace∣able and natural Death hath been also a Reward
for his so great a Moderation; nor can any one doubt but Heaven hath had a particular care of that life, which hath been so often attempted and so desperately assaulted: Not but that he would happily have rather chosen to have dyed with his Sword in his hand, for the Glory of God and the Defence of his Countrey, as better befitting his Warlike humor and Men of Cou∣rage, but Heaven had otherwise evidenced its Mi∣racles in his preservation. Nor had our Cham∣pion had the glory to have wrestled with this powerful Enemy upon unequal terms, and in an estate wherein the imbecillity of the Spirit hath no other relief but that of Grace and Reason: This his preservation was also an effect of his Prayers, which he had chosen with a great deal of prudence out of the holy Writs. He caused one of his Gentlemen often to read the tenth Chapter of Matthew's Gospel; and twice a day himself rehearsed the 71. Psalm of David, which hath so near a relation to his Fortune and to his Affairs, as that one would believe it had been a Prophesie purposely dictated by the holy Ghost for him; or else that this great Personage was a Mortal Figure of that great Favourite of God, who hath done so many marvellous things with such slender beginnings, passing through so many obstacles, difficulties, and dangers: so like∣wise was it very just, that he should enter into the eternal Rest on the like day wherein he had undergone such great and glorious Labours and Dangers; and that he should triumph over Death even in his weakness, at the like time
wherein he had overcome her at her fullest strength and greatest advantages. This confor∣mity happened unto him as well as to several other great Personages of the Earth, but by such observable and reiterated notable actions, as that it is void of all doubt but the Heavens had foretold by the Stars (which are the Look∣ing-glasses and Rule of all famous Mens Lives) the Events of our glorious Protectors successes. To instance in some, Alexander the Great was born on the sixth day of April, on the like day the famous Temple of Diana at Ephesus was burnt, presaging that fire which this Conqueror should kindle in Asia. On a sixth day of April he overcame Darius King of Persia in a Battle; and on the like day he departed this life: where∣unto there may be added, that his Birth was pre∣ceded by a famous Victory which the Greeks his Subjects obtained on a sixth day of April against the Persians hard by Plutea, and by a Naval Combat which also happened the same day. So likewise Pompey was born and triumph∣ed on a like day, to wit, the thirtieth of the Moneth of September. Charles the Fifth the Emperour had also such like observable En∣counters: he was born on a twenty fourth of February, and being twenty four years old, on the like day he obtained a great Victory, in which a great King was taken prisoner. And on a twenty fourth day of February, he was crown∣ed Emperour by the Pope. But not to look any further then our own Countrey, and into our own Histories; It is ob∣served
that his late Highness our present Lord Protector, Richard, was Installed in his Prote∣ctorship on the like day, being a third day of Sep∣tember, when as Richard the First, that Famous King of England, so much spoken of in the Histo∣ries by reason of his great Wit, Understanding, and Resolution, began his Reign; an accident which cannot choose but promise a most favour∣able Omen and good Token. In like manner his late Highness had more favourable and famous dayes encountring together, then any of those foregoing Worthies which we have specified. The re∣markable passages which happened on the like dayes in his High∣ness life. For on a third of September he was confirm∣ed in his Protectorship by the Parliament. On a third of September he gained in Scotland that famous Battel of Dunbar. On a third of Septem∣ber he gained that great Battel at Worcester. And Finally, on a third of September his glorious life was Crowned with a peaceable and resolved death in the midst of all his Triumphs, in his Pa∣lace at White-hall, with all the comforts which good hopes could give in his posterity, both to his Children, and to the Companions of his Fortune. His late Highness Corps re∣moved to Somerset-House. The Corps of his late Highness having been Embalmed and wrapped up in a sheet of Lead, was on the six and twentieth of September, about ten of the Clock at night, privately removed from White-hall to Sommerset-house, being one∣ly attended by his own Domestick Officers and Servants, as the Lord Chamberlain, and Com∣ptroller of the Houshold, the Gentlemen of the Life-guard, the Guard of Halberdiers, and di∣vers
other Officers and Servants, two Heralds of Arms went next before the Corps, which was placed in a morning Hearse, drawn by six Horses; in which manner it was carried to Som∣merset-House, where it remained for some dayes in private untill things were in a readiness to ex∣pose it in State to a publick view, which was per∣formed with the following order and Solemnity. The man∣ner of his Highness lying in State. The first Room at Sommerset-House where the Spectators entred, was formerly the Pre∣sence Chamber, compleatly hung with Black, at the upper end whereof was placed a Cloth of State with a Chair of State under the same. The second large Room was formerly the Privy Chamber, hung with Black, with a Cloth and Chair of State under the same. The third Room was formerly the Withdraw∣ing Room, hung with BlackCloth, & had a Cloth and Chair of State in it as the former; all which three large Rooms were compleatly furnished with Scutcheons of his Highness Arms crowned with the Imperial Crown; and at the head of each Cloth of State was fixed a large majestique Scutcheon fairly painted and gilt upon Taffity. The fourth Room where both the Corps and the Effigies did lye, was compleatly hung with Black Velvet, and the Roof was cieled with Vel∣vet, and a large Canopy or Cloth of State of black Velvet fringed, was plated over the Ef∣figies made to the life in Wax. The Effigies it self being apparel'd in a rich suit of uncut Vel∣vet, robed in a little Robe of Purple Velvet, laced with a rich Gold Lace, and furr'd with Ermins;
upon the Kirtle was the Royal large Robe of the like purple Velvet, laced and furred with Er∣mins, with rich strings and tassels of Gold; the Kirtle being girt with a rich embroidered Belt, wherein was a fair Sword, richly gilt and hatch'd with Gold, hanging by the side of the Effigies. In the right hand was the Golden Sce∣pter, representing Government; in the left hand the Globe, denoting Principality; upon the Head a purple Velvet Cap furr'd with Er∣mins, signifying Regality: Behinde the Head there was placed a rich Chair of State of tissued Gold, and upon the Cushion which lay thereon was placed an Imperial Crown set with precious Stones. The Body of the Effigies lay upon a Bed of State covered with a large Pall of black Velvet, under which there was spread a fine Holland Sheet upon six stools of tissued Cloth of Gold: on the sides of the Bed of State was placed a rich suit of compleat Armour, repre∣senting his late Highness Command as General: at the Feet of the Effigies stood his Crest ac∣cording to the custom of ancient Monuments. The Bed of State whereupon the Effigies did thus lie, was ascended unto by two steps cover∣ed with the aforesaid Pall of Velvet, the whole work being compassed about with Rails and Bal∣lasters covered with Velvet; at each corner whereof there was placed an upright Pillar co∣vered with Velvet, upon the tops whereof were the four Supporters of the Imperial Arms, bear∣ing Banners or Streamers Crowned. The Pillars were adorned with Trophies of Military Honour
carved and gilt; the pedestalls of the Pillars had Shields and Crowns gilt which compleated the whole work. Within the Rails and Balla∣sters stood eight great Silver Candlesticks, or Standarts, almost five soot high, with Virgin∣wax Tapers of three foot long; next unto the Candlesticks there were set upright in Sockets the four great Standards of his Higness Arms, the Guydons, great Banners, and Banrolls of war being all of Taffity very richly gilt and painted. The Cloth of State which covered the Bed of State, and the Effigies, had a Majestick Scutcheon; and the whole Room was fully and compleatly adorned with Taffity Scutcheons: several of his late Highness's Gentlemen attending bare-headed round about the Bed of State in Mourn∣ing; and other of his Highness's Servants wait∣ing in the other Rooms, to give directions to the spectators, and to prevent disorders. His late Highness standing in State. After which, his late Highness Effigies was se∣veral dayes shown in another Room, standing upon an Ascent under a rich Cloth of State; vested in royal Robes having a Scepter in one hand, and a Globe in the other, a Crown on his Head, his Armour lying by him at a distance, and the Banners, Banrolls, and Standards being placed round about him, together with the other Ensigns of Honour: the whole Room which was spacious being adorned in a majestical manner, and several of his late Highness's Gentlemen at∣tending about the Effigies bare-headed, in which manner the Effigies continued until the solem∣nization of the Funerals.
The Fu∣neral So∣lemnities perform∣ed at his late High∣ness's In∣terment. On the three and twentieth day of Novem∣ber in the morning, the time appointed for the solemnization of the Funerals of his late High∣ness, the several persons of Honour and quality which were invited to attend the Interment, be∣ing come to Somerset-house, and all things be∣ing in a readiness to proceed; the Effigies of his late Highness standing under a rich Cloath of State in the manner afore specified, was first shown to the company, and afterwards removed and placed on a Hearse richly adorned and set forth with Scutcheons and other Ornaments; the Effigies it self being vested in Royal Robes, a Scepter in one hand, a Globe in the other, and a Crown on the Head: after it had been a while thus placed in the middle of a Room, it was carri∣ed on the Hearse by ten of his late Highness Gen∣tlemen into the Court-yard, where a very rich Canopy of State was born over it by six other of his late Highness Gentlemen till it was brought and placed on the Chariot, at each end whereof was a seat wherein sate two of his late Highness's Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber, the one at the Head and the other at the Feet of the Effigies. The Pall which was made of Velvet and the white linnen was very large, extending on each side of the carriage and was born up by several persons of Honour thereunto appointed. The Chariot wherein the Effigies was conveyed, was covered with black Velvet, adorned with Plumes and Scutcheons, and was drawn by six Horses covered with black Velvet, and each of them adorned with black Plumes of Feathers.
From Somerset-house to Westminster the streets were railed in, and strawed with Sand; the Sol∣diers being placed on each side of the steeets without the Rails, and their Ensigns wrapped up in a Cypress mourning Veil. The manner of the proceeding to the Interment, was briefly thus. The seve∣ral distin∣ctions ob∣served in the Fune∣ral Solem∣nities. First, a Knight Martial advanced on Horse-back with his black Truncheon tipt at both ends with Gold, attended by his Deputy and thirteen men on Horseback, to clear the way. After him followed the Poor men of Westmin∣ster in mourning Gowns and Hoods, marching two and two. Next unto them followed the Servants of the several persons of all qualities, which attended the Funeral. These were followed by all his late Highness's Servants, as well inferiour as superiour, both within and without the Household, as also all his Highness's Barge-men and Water-men. Next unto these followed the Servants and Officers belonging to the Lord Major and She∣riffs of the City of London. Then came several Gentlemen and attendants on the respective Ambassadors, and the other Publique Ministers. After those came the poor Knights of Windsor in Gowns and Hoods. Then followed the Clerks, Secretaries, and other Officers belonging to the Army, the Ad∣miralty,
the Treasury, the Navy, and Exchequer. After these came the Officers in Command in the Fleet, as also the Officers of the Army. Next followed the Commissioners for Excize, those of the Army, and the Committee of the Navy. Then followed the Commissioners for the Ap∣probation of Preachers. Then came the Officers, Messengers, and Clerks belonging to the Privy Councel, and the Clerks of both Houses of Parliament. Next followed his late Highness Physicians. The Head Officers of the Army. The Chief Officers and Aldermen of the City of London. The Masters of the Chancery, with his High∣ness learned Councel at Law. The Judges of the Admiralty, the Masters of Request, with the Judges in Wales. The Barons of the Exchequer, the Judges of both Benches, and the Lord Major of London. Next to these the persons allied in Blood to his late Higness, and the Members of the Lords House. After them the Publique Ministers of Forreign States and Princes. Then the Holland Ambassador alone, whose Train was born up by four Gentlemen. Next to him the Portugal Ambassador alone, whose Train was held up by four Knight of the Order of Christ. And thirdly the French Ambassador, whose Train was also held up by four persons of quality
Then followed the Lords Commissioners of the great Seal. The Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. The Lords of his late Highness most Honor∣able Privy Councel. After whom followed the chief Mourner, and those persons of quality which were his As∣sistants, and bare up his Train. All the Nobles were in close Mourning, the rest were but in or∣dinary, being disposed in their passage into se∣veral Divisions, being distinguished by Drums and Trumpets, and by a Standard or Banner born by a Person of Honor and his assistant, and a Horse of State covered with black Velvet, and led by a person of Honor, followed by two Grooms: Of which Horses there were eleven in all, four covered with black Cloth, and seven with Velvet. These being all passed in order, at length the Chariot followed with the Effigies, on each side of which were born six Banner Rolls, twelve in all, by as many persons of Ho∣nor. The several pieces of his late Highness Ar∣mor were born by eight Honorable persons, Of∣ficers of the Army, attended by a Herald and a Gentleman on each side. Next followed Garter principal King of Arms, attended with a Gen∣tleman on each side bare-headed. Then came the chief Mourner together with those Lords and noble personages that were sup∣porters and assistants to the chief Mourner. Then followed the Horse of Honor in very rich Trappings embroidered upon Crimson Vel∣vet, and adorned with white, red, and yellow
Plumes, and was led by the Master of the Horse. Finally, in the close of all followed his late Highness Guard of Halberdiers, and the War∣ders of the Tower. The Solemnity was mannaged with a great deal of State from Somerset-House to Westmin∣ster, many thousands of people being Specta∣tors in the Windows and upon the Scaffolds all along the way as it passed. At the West Gate of the Abbey Church, the Hearse with the Effigies thereon was taken off again from the Chariot by those ten Gentlemen who placed it thereon before, and in their pas∣sing on to carry it into the Church, the Canopy of State was by the former six Gentlemen born over it again: In which stately manner it was carried up to the East end of the Abbey, and there placed in that Magnificent structure which was purposely erected there to receive it; where it is to remain for some time exposed to publick view. The Corps having been some dayes be∣fore Interred in Henry the Seventh's Chappel in a Vault purposely prepared for the same, over which a costly Monument is preparing. Thus have you a brief Relation of the last Ceremonies of Honor which were performed to the Memory of his late Highness, who by his Heroick Acts had so well deserved, as that my dull pen not able to express them, I shall remit the Reader to censure my endeavours, and sub∣mit to those that shall hereafter undertake to present the World with a larger Chronicle. FINIS.
THE CHARACTER of his late Serene Highness, OLIVER, Late Lord Protector: With several Reflections on the fore∣going History. SEeing Philosophers are of opinion, that the Resemblance of Children to their Parents, as well in their bodily shapes and features, as in the Inclinations of their Souls, is produced by one and the self-same Cause; chiefly grounded upon this reason, That the one is the Representative of the other. And seeing moreover; that we may not attribute un∣to a material Cause an immaterial Effect, such as are all the operations of a Rational Soul; they reject the power of a forming vertue, the the Imaginary one, the Constellation of the Planets, and the qualities of the Seed. To fix
upon a more sublime mystery, whereby God would have the Legitimateness of Children and Nephews to be manifested, rather by the bet∣ter part of man, which is the Soul, then by his Complexion, his Behaviour, his Speech, and the shape of his Body. And that such glo∣rious souls as are wrapt up as it were in the body, should like unto a transparent sun penetrate through those thick clouds, and by that resplendency which they infuse through the whole body, should attract the esteem and veneration which they beget in men; either in the vulgar sort, who are onely taken with the out-side, or in the malicious and envious, who endeavour to smoother those Talents in others which they do not possess themselves. Which truth, that we may the better make good, it will not be amiss, having first repre∣sented unto you some of his late Highness the Lord Protectors memorable Acts, to demon∣strate unto you the greatness of his soul, and how well it was placed, whereby all its Heroical vertues may, as through a Chri∣stal glass, appear unto the eyes of the whole world. In this wise all Hystoriographers have pro∣ceeded, not onely in their describing of the lives of Illustrious Personages, but also in subduing of Cities and Towns, Foretresses, and places of Consequence, which no sooner had received the Conquerours yoke, but the Origine and Foun∣dations were narrowly pried into, the manner of their being fortified was described, the form of
their being besieged, the assaults which they su∣steined, and the glory which they acquired even by their surrendry upon honorable terms; where∣as on the contrary, inconsiderate ones are quite neglected, their appellations and reductions be∣ing scarce deemed worthy to be specified in a History. In like manner, since death after several vain attempts and successess assaults hath at length bereaved us of our Illustrious late Lord Prote∣ctor, we shall give you the Character of his person, to let you see how much he resembled his glorious predecessors. And howbeit we may thereby somewhat diminish and detract from his glory, however so beautiful a soul as his was, accompanied by a body participating of all those Organs which were succeptible of such high and admirable operations, could not choose but produce the ensuing glorious effects? In his person he somewhat exceeded the usu∣al middle stature, but was well proportioned ac∣cordingly, being of a becoming fatness, well sha∣ped, having a masculine face, a sparkling eye, both courteous and harsh at once, according as there was occasion; hardy and fierce in com∣bats and reprehensions, tempered in councels and meek, promising to the afflicted and suitors. He was of a strong constitution, and of an active bo∣dy well disposed, an enemy both to ease and excess; and although in his youth he was capa∣ble of, yet he used not those fair and bewitching pleasures which a countrey (where idleness and wantonness did reign) doth afford to vigorous
constitutions with a great deal of mediocrity in the War, he was active, vigilant, and circum∣spect; and although he was doubtless one of the best head-pieces in the world, yet he disdained not to conferre and take counsel with others, even in Affairs of the least concernment. His greatest delight was to read men rather then books, and his Eloquence which was both Masculine and Martial, was rather a natural gift then an effect of art, wherein he alwayes min∣gled some passages of the holy Writ, in which his piety had amply instructed him; to which most charming part as well as to his Sword, he owed most of his Conquests and Victories; being al∣wayes accustomed to exhort and animate his Souldiers at the undertaking of any great enter∣prize, and before the giving of a battle, so like∣wise after he had gained the victory, he himself did express unto God his thankfulness and ac∣knowledgements with so profound an humility, as that he attributed unto God alone all his good success; and did constantly refuse all those triumphs which were prepared for, and profered to his valour. He had an especial care to have Piety and Godliness reign in his Armies, and pu∣nished as a most enormious crime, those who took Gods name in vain. Moreover, he loved his Souldiers as his Children, and his greatest care was to see them provided for with all necessa∣ries requisite; by which foresight and provi∣vidence, he was the better able to execute that severe punishment which he usually caused to be inflicted on those who plundred and spoiled
the Peasants, for which crime he would not have pardoned his ownbrother; and on the other side he was alwayes most bountiful and liberal to his Souldiers, and those Pensions which are yet payed daily unto the old Souldiers, unto their Widows, and to the maimed and hurt men, may save those charges which some Princes have been at to hire persons to weep and lament at their Funerals, and over their Tombs. See Histo∣ry and Policy re¦viewed. He took great delight to discourse of the Af∣fairs of the World, and his own judgement did furnish him with such exact resolutions con∣cerning the Government of his Estates, and touching the interests of other Princes, as with∣out the entring into their Cabinets, or parta∣king of their Counsels, he discoursed very per∣tinently of their Affairs, and foretold their se∣veral issues and events. He likewise was an ex∣cellent Phisionomer, and having once seriously considered any one, he was seldome deceived in the opinion he conceived of him. He married into the ancient and noble fami∣ly of the Bourchers, whence the Earls of Essex were descended; his marriage bed was blessed with many Children, none of which did ever degenerate from the eminent vertues of their most Illustrious Father. His eldest son named Ricard hath succeeded him in the Protector∣ship; his younger son named Henry, being at this time Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; both of them capable to follow their Fathers glori∣ous footsteps, and to perfect and crown such hopeful, promising, though difficult, beginnings; their Father having as it were divided, shared,
and left by inheritance unto their youth (swel∣ling with marvellous hopes) that most exquisite Quintessence of two great Talents, which he had acquired by his age and by his experience; so that the one of his sons may be stiled the Jupiter, and the other the Mars of England. He had four Daughters, all of them Ladies of a most eminent and vertuous disposition: The Lady Bridget first married unto the Lord Ireton, in his life time Lord Deputy of Ireland, a Per∣sonage of sublime worth; and afterwards e∣spoused unto the Lord Fleetwood, sometimes Lord Deputy of Ireland, and at present Lieutenant Ge∣neral of all his Highness Forces. The Lady Eliza∣beth his second Daughter, married unto the Lord Cleypoll, and dyed a little before her Father; of whom we shall speak hereafter. The third, the Lady Mary, espoused unto the Lord Viscount Faulconbridge. And the youngest, the Lady Frances, at present widow of the Lord Robert Rich, Grandchilde to the late Earl of Warwick. Nor did the change of his late Highness For∣tunes in the least decline or diminish the ten∣derness and affection which he ever bare to∣wards the worthy Mother of so numerous and hopeful an issue; and that absolute power which he had over all his Dominions, never gave him the least desire to captivate any heart, save that which God had given him in marriage. And that which is the most to be admired at, and seems to be the summe of all bliss, is, that the Almighty lent his late Highness so much life as to see all his Children disposed to the most gal∣lant
personages, and allied to the most Illustri∣ous Families of England; which are as so many props of his Fortune, and Fences against the en∣viers of his Vertue. He was an enemy to vain gloriousness & osten∣tation, and although he was all as it were fire, that is, of a passionate constitution; yet he had so overcome his passions, that he was seldome or never moved but when there was a great cause given: so likewise was he more subject to re∣press and keep in, then to give way to his pas∣sion. The actions of his body denoted those of his minde, his actions were in a manner without motion, and without any forcings of the body; in like manner his minde was not at all agitated, nor his expressions precipitated; sweetness and tranquillity accompanied his thoughts and his words; but when there was occasion to carry a business, he expressed himself with so much vi∣gour, as gave to understand, that he was not ea∣sily to be disswaded from the thing he had once resolved. In like manner during the whole course of the War, he never harboured the least thought of changing of parties. And as for Ambition, which is the onely passion whereof envy it self seems to accuse him, the effects thereof were so inconfide∣rable and unnecessary unto him, nay, so unplea∣sing and unwelcome; and which is more, he so often refused the pomps, delights, and gran∣dours which were profered him, that all the world must needs confess, that where Nature could claim so small an interest, the master and
directer of Nature must needs have had a great share. Wherefore we may aver with a great deal of reason, That in case he hath hoorded and laid up Treasures, it hath been in the In∣trals of the Poor of all Sexes, and of all Nations, of all Professions and Religions, both at home and abroad; insomuch, that it hath been com∣puted, that out of his own private instinct par∣ticular Motions and pious Compassion, he di∣stributed at least forty thousand pounds a year in Charitable Uses, out of his own purse, out of such Moneys as the Commonwealth did allow him for his Domestique Expences, and for the maintenance of his State, and the Dignity of his Person, Family, and the keeping up the splendour of his Court. And the better to illustrate this matter, we shall insert an Essay of two examples of Gene∣rosity and Gratitude, which are not to be paral∣lel'd, save in the persons of Thomas Lord Crom∣well, his late Highness's predecessor, in Henry the Eighth's Reign, and in the person of his late Highness, Oliver Lord Protector. An exam∣ple of gra∣titude and generosity in the Lord Tho. Crom∣well. In those glorious dayes, when the English young Gentry endeavored to out-vie their elder Brothers, by undertaking far and dange∣rous journies into Forreign parts, to acquire glory by feats of Arms, and experiencing them∣selves in the Military Discipline; Thomas Cromwel a younger Brother, to better his know∣ledge in Warlike Affairs passed into France, and there trailed a Pike, accompanying the
French Forces into Italy, where they were de∣feated at Gattellion; whereupon our English Volantier betook himself to Florence, designing to pass thence home again into England; but having loft all his equipage, and being in a ne∣cessitated condition, he was enforced to ad∣dress himself to one Signior Francisco Fresco∣bald an Italian Merchant, who corresponded at London; and making his case known unto him, Frescobald observing something remarkable, and a certain promising greatness in the Fea∣tures, Actions, and Deportment of Thomas Cromwel, who gave an account of himself with so candid an ingenuity, and in such terms as be∣seemed his Birth, and the Profession he then was of: whereby he gained so much upon Fresco∣bald, as inviting him home to his house, he caused him to be accommodated with new Linnen and Clothes, and other sutable necessa∣ries; kindly entertaining him, till such time as he testified a desire to return for England; when as to compleat his Generosity and Kinde∣ness, he gave Mr. Thomas Cromwell a Horse, and sixteen Duccats in gold, to prosecute his jour∣ney homewards. In process of time, several disasters and Bank∣rupts befalling Signior Frescobald, his Trading and Credit was not a little thereby impaired; and reflecting on the Moneys which were due unto him by his Correspondents in England, to the value of 15000. Duccats, he resolved to pass thither, and try whether he could happily procure payment.
During which interval of time, Mr. Thomas Cromwell being a person endowed with a great deal of Courage, of a transcendent Wit, hardy in his undertakings, and a great Politician, had by these his good qualities gotten himself en∣trance and credit at Court, and highly ingratia∣ted himself with King Henry the Eighth; ha∣ving advanced himself to almost as high a pitch of Honour, in as short a time, in a manner, as his late Highness did. The Lord Thomas Cromwell therefore riding one day with a great train of Noble Men to∣wards the Kings Palace, chanced to espy on foot in the streets Signior Frescobald, the Italian Mer∣chant, in an ill plight: however, he immediate∣ly alighting from his Horse, embraced him be∣fore all the world, to the great astonishment of the beholders; and chid him, that at his very arrival he came not to visit him. Frescobald being astonished at so unexpected an encounter, and receiving so signal a favor from a personage he could not call to minde he had ever known, was quite surprized; and my Lord Cromwells pressing affairs at Court not permitting him the while to acquaint him further who he was, one∣ly engaged him to come and dine with him that day. Frescobald full of amazement, enquired of the attendants who that great personage might be? And hearing his name, he began to call the Feature of his Face, and the Idea of his Person to mind; and so by degrees conceiving with himself it might happily be the same Mr. Thomas Cromwell whom he had harboured at
Florence; he enquired out his Lordships habi∣tation, and attended his coming at Noon-tide, walking in his Court-yard. No sooner was the Lord Thomas Cromwel entred the same, (attend∣ed by several persons of quality, and officers of the Crown) but speedily alighting from his Horse, he embraced his friend Frescobald in the same manner he had done in the morning; and perceiving that the Lords which accompanied him were amazed at such a disproportioned fa∣miliarity, he told them that he was more obli∣ged to Frescobald then to all the men in the world, owing unto him the making of his For∣tune; and so proceeded to relate unto them the whole story which had befallen him at Florence. So great a delight do generous mindes take to recount their foregoing Misfortunes, when their Grandor hath elevated them to such a pitch, as that they triumph over Shame, and are incapa∣ble of Ingratitude. Frescobald was treated at Dinner with all the tenderness he could expect from so great a per∣sonage, and so good a friend; after which being carried up by the Lord T. Cromwel into his Clo∣set, he was there presented with four bags of Gold, each containing four hundred Duccats, in return of his former civilities: which Fresco∣bald (being of a gallant spirit) at first refused, but after several contestations was constrained to accept as an acknowledgement from the Lord Cromwell; who, moreover enquiring of him concerning his coming over, and affairs in Eng∣land; and understanding his Losses, and that
there were Moneys due to him, caused him to write down his Debters names; and by his Se∣cretary summoned the several Merchants which were indebted to Frescobald (upon pain of his displeasure) to clear their Accounts with him, and to pay him within the space of fifteen days; which was accordingly performed: onely Fres∣cobald freely forgave them the Use. Over and above all which, the Lord Thomas Cromwell endeavoured to perswade his friend Frescobald to have remained in England the rest of his Dayes, profering to lend him a stock of 60000. Duccats to trade withall: But Fresco∣bald being over-charged with all those grand obligations which the Lord Cromwell had con∣ferred on him; having by his Lordships Ge∣nerosity acquired enough to keep him from be∣ing necessitated all his life time; and deeming that the trading in good Works was incompa∣rably more sure and gainful then in the richest Wares and Merchandizes, being resolved to quit Trading, and to end the rest of his dayes peace∣ably and quietly, he obtained leave of the Lord Thomas Cromwell to depart towards his own Countrey, freighted with so great obligations as caused in him a generous shame. But the Almighty doth not alwayes recom∣pense the fruits of good Works here on Earth, often repaying the greatest with the least re∣wards; and Heaven delights in the exercising of its great Vertues, by the Vices which are thereunto opposite: and as the most noblest Creatures are the slowest in the attaining to
their perfections, so the Almighty doth not immediately cause those Fruits to ripen, which are sowed here below by Christian Charity. The Lord Tho. Crom∣wels Seed, Destiny, and end. Wherefore to return to the Lord Thomas Cromwell, who had made the Match between Anne of Cleve and King Henry the Eighth, you shall see how he was rewarded for his Genero∣sity and good Services; for this Princess Anne of Cleve, conceiving a certain womanish Jea∣lousie, she knew not why nor wherefore, against the Lord Thomas Cromwell, save onely that she apprehended he had too great a power and sway with the King; never left off solliciting and importuning of him, till he caused the Lord Thomas Cromwell to be beheaded; by which sad compliance, the King lost the best Suppor∣ter of his Crown, and the faithfullest of his Ser∣vants and Subjects. The Lord Thomas Crom∣well dyed without Heir Males, leavingone onely Daughter, espoused to one Mr. Williams a Gen∣tleman of Glamorganshire, of a good Family; who, as we have before said, inherited little of his Father, save his Vertues, besides what his own Deserts had procured him, and what he might promise himself by the Match with this Heiress the Lord Thomas Cromwels Daughter: (from whence our Lord Protectors are lineally descended) and who was the lively representa∣tive of her Father, and the very pourtraiture of his great soul, as the Lady Cleypool was of his late Highness the Lord Protector. Now that you may know on what occasion
How the Name of Williams came to be changed into that of Cromwell. the Name of Williams came to be changed into that of Cromwell; it happened when as King Henry the Eighth was in the midst of his Splen∣dor, Pomp, and Magnificence, wallowing in the pleasures of a sumptuous Entertainment at Court, Mr. Williams (who had been a retainer to the late Lord Thomas Cromwell) made his ap∣pearance before the King in deep Mourning, like a dark Cloud eclipsing the Sun at Noon-tide. The King casting his eye upon so unex∣pected and dismal an Object, (which seemed to reproach his rash fault) was surprized and of∣fended, at the interrupting of his Pleasures, by Williams so unseasonable apparition; wherefore the King asked him how he durst appear at Court in that garb? whereunto Williams replied with a sad but assured countenance, That not onely himself, but the King and all the Court had reason to mourn for the loss of the greatest and faithfullest of his Subjects and Servants, whose Death himself might one day chance to regret, when he should stand in need of his Councels and Fidelity. But the King whose thoughts were at that time taken up with his Pastimes, wished Williams to be gone, and to get himself cured of his Frenetick Mallady. Some while after troubles arising, and the King finding himself in a strait for want of so faithful a Minister of State as the late Lord Tho∣mas Cromwel was, whose life he had so inconsi∣derately taken away; began to reflect on the loss he had sustained; and how requisite it
was, for Princes, and great Potentates, to re∣tain near their Persons, Men of Knowledge, Worth and Fidelity; and calling to minde the action and discourse of Williams, conceiving that it could not proceed but from a great soul endowed with extraordinary vertues, and such a one as might be useful and serviceable to him; he sent for him up to Court, and commanding him to take the name of Cromwel upon himself, (unto whom he had testified so much Fidelity and Gratitude) he invested him with all the Of∣fices and Charges the late Lord Thomas Cromwel enjoyed near his person; and re-instated him again in all his Goods and Lands which had been confiscated; so that the Lord Williams assisted in the Kings Councel, as his Father in Law the Lord Thomas Cromwel before had done. His late Highness descent. From this Noble Lord Williams, alias Crom∣wel, and the Illustrious Daughter of the renown∣ed Lord Thomas Cromwel, his late Highness and our present Lord Protector are lineally descend∣ed; in whom the Almighty hath raised up and ripened those generous vertues of their prede∣cessors, and hath elevated and spread their branches as high, as their deep roots had taken profound and vigorous Foundations. So that to compleat our parallel, we may ob∣serve by the fruits of this Illustrious Stock from whence his late Highness is descended, whether they retained their accustomed Generosity and Clemency; which we will not go about to prove by the Military Acts, in which they have out∣vied their Predecessors; nor by their Politick
and prudent Government of the State, in which they have at least equalized them; but by their private and domestick actions, since the resem∣blance of Children to their Parents may be more observed by the Features of the Face, then by the course of their lives, which are subject to vary, either by the inconstancy of Fortune, or the Communication of other men. An ex∣ample of his late Highness gratitude.To come therefore to his late Highness the Lord Protector, and signalize his gratitude; we shall instance in the person of one Duret a French attendant of his Highness during his General-ship; who served him with so much Fi∣delity and Zeal, as that he intrusted him with the managing and conduct of the greatest part of his domestick Affairs; alwayes retaining him nigh his person, bearing so great an affection towards him, and reposing so entire a confi∣dence in him, as during his late Highness's great sickness which he had in Scotland, (and where∣of it was thought he would have dyed) he would not be served by any one, nor receive any nourishment, or any thing else that was admi∣nistred unto him, save from the hands of Du∣ret, who both day and night continued to watch by his Master; tending him with a speci∣al care and assiduity, not giving himself a Mo∣ments rest untill his late Highness had recover∣ed his perfect health; which long and continu∣al watches of Duret, and the pains he had ta∣ken in the administring unto his Master, plun∣ged him into a sad fit of sickness; during which, this faithful servant received all the acknow∣ledgements
which his good and zealous services had demerited, his late Highness applying all the possible cures he could, not onely by his commands, but by his personal visits, (so oft as his urgent Affairs would permit him) to comfort Duret, and to see all things applyed, that might conduce to his recovery: but Durets hour being come, he was content to lay down his life in his Masters service; and the Physicians having quite given him over, his late Highness would needs render him his last good offices, by com∣forting him at his death, by his sensibleness of his good services, and the extream zeal and affe∣ction he had born to his person; which al∣though he could not requite unto him, yet his Highness assured him he would manifest his ac∣knowledgements thereof unto his Parents and Kindred: Whereunto Duret replyed, That the honour he had received in having served so good and great a Master, and the glory he reaped in having laid down his life for the preservation of his Highness, and of so good and glorious a Cause, was extream, satisfactory unto him in his death. That he had a Mother and a Sister, with some Kindred in France, who were unworthy his Highness thoughts, or reflecting on them; however that he remitted them to his Highness gracious consideration. And so Duret, his good and faithful servant, breathed his last. In which contract of grief, and resolution of acknowledgement, his late Highness may be said to have harboured the same thoughts as Henry the Eighth did; perswading himself that
he had been the Author of Durets death, though in a far innocenter way; However his late Highness retained all the resentments and sensi∣bleness of the acknowledgements and gratitude, expressed by his generous predecessor the Lord Thomas Cromwel, towards his dear Friend Fres∣cobald. For his late Highness immediately sent over For Durets Mother, Sister, and two Nephews out of France, and would have the whole Fa∣mily of the Durets to come and establish them∣selves here in England; that he might the better manifest his Love and Gratitude in their per∣sons, towards his deceased faithful servant. And whereas by reason of the continuance of the Scotch Wars, his late Highness was at that time, as it were confined to the North, he wrote unto her Highness, the now Lady Protectoress Dowa∣ger, his wife, that she should receive and use Du∣rets Mother, Sister, and Allies, accordingly as she praised the good offices of his deceased faithful servant, to whose cares, pains, and watchings he owed the preservation of his own life; and that she should proportion that kindnes which during his absence she should show unto them, unto the love which she bore unto him; insomuch, that Durets Mother was by her Highness admitted into her own Family, and seated at her own Ta∣ble; his Sister was placed in the rank and qua∣lity of a Maid of Honour to her Highness; and his two Nephews were admitted to be her High∣nesses Pages; whereby the Almighty Crowned Durets good and faithful services towards his
Master, and his piety and observance towards his Mother and Sister, whose onely support he was in his life time, with the rich Flowers of Pro∣sperity, and with the Fruits of Fortune; advan∣cing them as fast as the sad destiny did his pre∣cipitated death. And no sooner was his late Highness returned into England after the conquest of Scotland, and the glorious Victory he had obtained at Worce∣ster, full freighted with the resplendency of his noble atchievements; but he desired to see Durets Mother, Sister, and Nephews, enquiring how they had been received, and treated; and whe∣ther they were well pleased to be in England; and as soon as they appeared in his presence, he could not retain his generous tears for the loss of Duret; nor could he cease to testifie his in∣ward grief for him, comforting the good old Gentlewoman Mrs. Duret, by the mouth of his Children who spake French, telling her, She had not lost her son, although dead; for that himself would be her son, since the preservation of his life had its being from her entralls; that both her and his Duret was with a better Master; a Master, who was his Master also; and whose recompences and rewards were for greater and more assured then these worldly ones. And that the great thoughts of his heart might not lose their force and energy, by his imploying of anothers tongue to express them; this great Personage who ne∣ver made use of the French language to enter∣tain the Ambassador of Kings and Princes with∣all, did put himself to the trouble of learning
some French words, with which he alwayes was used to chear up and comfort the good old Wo∣man whensoever he met her: and he that was wont to swim in the blood of his enemies, and could look with an undiscomposed brow on thousands of men, and of his friends, lying dead on the Field after a battle, had so much tender∣ness for the loss of one of his domestique Ser∣vants, as that he could not refrain from tears when he beheld any of Durets relations. Nor need we to wonder hereat, since his late High∣nesses general spirit contained as well private as publique Vertues. And his Reason which was alwayes mistress of his Passions, knew full well how to imploy them on such occasions, and at such times as they were most requisite and com∣mendable: to let us see, That the Dignity of a General and a Protector, had not made him re∣linquish the quality of a Man; and that Ma∣ximes and Reasons of State had forced several things from him, which were absolutely repug∣nant to his natural inclinations. Besides, this great Politician knew, that the greatest part of Famous Men, which Fortune had elevated to the top of her Wheel, were for the most part come to untimely ends by the corruption of their domestique Servants, or the treachery of their intimatest Friends and bosom Favourites: in regard whereof, his late Highness lamented the more the loss of this his Faithful Servant. Nor need we to wonder hereat, since For∣tune had heaped all the perfections of Vertues in his great Soul, which he evidently manifested,
by his so orderly, and peaceably re-uniting, and as it were, matching together the Vertues both of War and Peace; the ruffness and harshness of War, with the tenderness of Nature; their Licentiousness with Piety; Confusion with good Order; and so resplendent an eminent Great∣ness, to such inconsiderate, abject, and humble domestique considerations. Wherefore this Nation may account it self thrice happy, in enjoying such sublime rising Powers to govern it, who are able to distinguish between Good and Evil; and who suffer not themselves to be puffed up so high, as that they scorn and disdain to look downwards, and so stand not in need (as the waters poured far from the Ocean) of a borrowed and corrosive salt, to preserve things from corruption. Thus as I have already given you rather a Glimpse then a Character of his late Highness his Person, I shall now render you some other considerable Remarks of his Affairs. After the discoveries of an hundred Plots and Designs laid open and frustrated, the defeating of many jealous parties all of them convinced; and finally, sundry Forreign Negotiations and Treaties, which hath given you occasion as well to admire his Judgement as his Valour, whence you have found as bold undertakings to have proceeded from his late Highness, as ever were commented; and as admirable Conquests on the Continent, as may well answer the ancient (though long time dormatick) Valour of the English Nation.
To consider how he joyned the Piety and good Order of Numa with the Vigour and Force of Romulus, in those foundations which he laid of this new and Warlike Empire; which although they scarce budded forth of the earth, are never the less substantial enough to bear up a solid building; and do sufficiently discover all the several beautiful Repartitions of the same in a most exquisite manner, and in a goodly ground plot. First, his late Highness settled such a Military Discipline, as partaking of the Vertues of the three first Roman Founders, did strike a terrour into the most ambitious Monarchs of the earth; and doth give Instructions, or rather read Le∣ctures on both the Christian and Moral Vertues unto that Nation which pretends to be the wi∣sest and most Religious of all the world. See Histo∣ry and Po∣lice re∣viewed. I be∣lieve that if a Croysade had armed all the Priests and Religious Men, there would not be so strict an order observed in their Christian Military Discipline, as that which we now see is establish∣ed in England, where Sobriety flourisheth amidst abundance, in a Countrey where formerly De∣bauchery was accounted as a Gallantry, and converted into a custom; where Modesty is wedded to Cruelty, Justice with the extremity of Power, Meekness with the stubborness of Arms, War with Piety, Valour with Fear and Obedience. And since we speak of the Piety of this English Pompilius, may we not say that the Goddess Ageria did nightly in his solitudes ap∣pear unto him.
Nor need we to say that he made use of fire and flames by a barbarous and unchristian-like Zeal to establish the truth of the Gospel. Nor did he send millions of Pagans to Hell, thereby to be strong enough to force five hundred against their wills into Heaven: The Piety of this our Common Father was void of Envy and Cruelty. He hath defied the Tyrants over mens Conscien∣ces by Clemency and Charity, and hath caused those who profess those two Vertues before all others (which are more sublime though less profitable to our neighbours, and consequently of less concernment) to doubt, whether or no the Quality of the most Christian King is not far better then that of the Catholique. All which being maturely considered, we may say when a State erreth both in the Ecclesiastique and Po∣litique Government, he that is invested with the Sovereign Power, far from being reputed a Ty∣rant, is accountable before God if he doth re∣fuse the same, and if he lets that Talent remain useless which may otherwise be advantageous to the whole world. To say more of his Generosity, this Vertue he highly recommended above all others unto his Ministers of State, and unto his Ambassadors, and unto his Children; and whereof that noble Lady Cleypoll, his Daughter of worthy memory, did give so many evidences during her life, and even at the Article of her Death, as that she thereby did beget tears in the most obstinate and hardiest enemies of this State. A worthy Daugh∣ter of so famous a Father, whom Heaven too
soon snatched away both from the Vertuous and from the Miserable; and whose soul did ad∣mirably correspond with her Fortune, and the Majesty of her Comportment. How many of the Royalist prisoners got she not freed? How many did she not save from Death whom the Laws had condemned? How many persecuted Christians hath she not snatcht out of the hands of the tormenters; quite contrary unto that Herodias who could do any thing with her fa∣ther. She imployed her Prayers even with Tears to spare such men whose ill fortune had designed them to suffer: when as this grand Heroe being transported as it were, and even ravished to see his own Image so lively described in those love∣ly and charming Features of that winning Sex, could refuse her nothing; insomuch, that when his Clemency and Justice did balance the pardon of a poor Criminal, this most charming Advo∣cate knew so skilfully to disarm him, that his Sword falling out of his hands, his arms onely served to lift her up from those knees on which she had cast her self, to wipe off her tears, and to imbrace her. So likewise it is believed, that this illustrious Princess precipitated death, did not a little contribute to his late Highnesses sick∣ning; all whose noble parts were found to be ve∣ry sound and whole, onely his Heart, which sor∣row had seized and dryed up. Nor did he long out-live her, since it was impossible he should survive the love of so generous a dispencer of his Clemency and Generosity. For brevity, I shall make choice of one of the
Ambassadours of this Commonwealth, to denote the splendor of the glorious Ministers of this generous Prince; he being in such a place where he hath more occasion then any of the rest, to give far ampler marks of the most Heroical Ver∣tue, which acquires more glory to the victorious then the victory it self, and which is the most as∣sured Character of a true Christian, his Excellen∣cy the Lord Lockhart, Ambassador in the Court of France, General of his Highness Forces in Flanders, and Governour of the Town of Dun∣kirk, who is espoused to that most renowned Lady one of his late Highness's Neeces. In both which noble Personages we may behold at once shining forth those two happy and glorious Ta∣lents, which most of all render persons of their Birth and Quality recommendable and famous. His person seems onely to have been sent into France to charm the whole Nation, and to at∣tract and accumulate graces; and did he not ex∣pose himself to so many dangers and hazards in the Wars, men might easily believe that after he had long born Arms in Holland, in France, and ten years space for the late King of Eng∣land, that he onely ranged himself on the victo∣rious sides to save the Kings Party, and to re∣instate them in their Lands and Goods. Wherefore the Generosity, Courtesie, and Affability of his late Highness did so super∣abound, as that no one person ever departed from his presence unsatisfied; for he received the Petitions of all men, he heard their Grievances, and his charitable memory was so retentive, as
that he never forgot their requests, but made it his chief object to bear them in minde, and most tenderly to provide for them. He esteem∣ed those he had overcome, and took a delight to pardon them, and to make them sharers of his good Fortune; provided that they would give over to make themselves unfortunate, by their obstinacy. He was used to say, that Hearts were as well to be overcome as Fortresses, and that the one were no more to be demolished then the other, because they had belonged to other Masters; insomuch, that he esteemed it a great Conquest to have gained a gallant Man to his party. And as for those who have been put to death in his time, they may be said to have been their own Judges, and their own exe∣cutioners. And however Politicians hold, that in the changing of a Government, all things ought likewise to be changed if possible, even the very Religion it self, (were men prophane enough to meddle therewith) and that Cruelty ought wholly to banish Clemency, yet all men know, that as to the point of Religion, he did leave things as he found them; and that he saved more lives by thousands, then obstinacy and de∣spair did cause to perish. Nay, he did even wish when he came to have a more absolute power towards the latter end of his dayes, that those which had been put to death were yet alive; pro∣testing solemnly, that if he could not change their hearts he would have changed their Dooms, and convert their deaths into a banish∣ment; which is easily to be believed, by the
goodness which he hath exercised towards the children of such as were put to death, even those who were his most implacable enemies; lea∣ving them in possession both of their Goods and Titles; and whose losses he hath recompen∣sed by such civillities as doth evidence, he learn∣ed not his Politicks in Machiavils School; See Histo∣ry and Policy re¦viewed. who teacheth, that the children and all the Generati∣on were to be exterminated together with their Fathers: so that many men wished that his Highnesses power had been as absolute ten years since as it was some years before his death. So likewise those Alliances which he made, and those Wars which he undertook, had all of them motives of Generosity, and were founded on Equity and Reason; if so be we consider the very first whereinto he onely stept by the degree of a Captain, and which may be termed a ne∣cessary evil and an inevitable one, begotten by the remissness of the Political Body, and by the corruption of the Clergy; I do finde that two high injustices were the primitive causes thereof, the first was the usurpations of the Saxons, Danes, and Normanns; the second was the peace∣ful humor and dispositions of King James, and the idleness and sloathfulness of the Nobility, who constrained their younger brethren to serve them, or to learn Trades, by taking away from them the means to subsist by the way of Arms; which is a priviledge more then legitimate, due by the elder brother to the younger, and by Princes to such Martial Spirits as live in their Dominions; if the Saxons and other Usurpers or
Conquerors of England did by force of Arms become Masters of the Countrey, and did cast out the right Possessours thereof, and by success of time falling from a Forreign Injustice into a Domestick Injustice, they reduced their younger Brothers to Mecannick professions. At present they demand that they may be permitted to expose their bloods and their lives for the preservation of their Brethrens: That the exercise of Arms may be abolished in so Populous and Warlike a State: that the banish∣ed glory which formerly with so much Pomp reigned in England may be restored again. And as for the War which his late Highness declared against Spain, that is so generous, that a man may averre, that glory was the onely mo∣tive thereof; and that thereby he espoused the Interest of all the people which were oppressed, and of all the Princes which the Ambition of Spain had despoyled of their States and Territo∣ries. And the two most unfortunate people of the earth were the first objects of his Generosi∣ty, and those which were the most of all aban∣doned, were the first that felt the effects of that Arm which stretched it self forth to their as∣sistance; Which you may see in two Books, viz. Teats of the In∣dies, and the other, America Painted to the life. To wit, the poor Indians, those wretch∣ed slaves, who behold no other faces save those of their tormentors; and who were made to be∣lieve that perishing in the Mines of Peru, they thereby did raise to themselves Thrones of Glo∣ry in Heaven, since thereby they furnished Spain wherewithal to adorne and inrich Altars throughout the whole world. In these torrid
Climates the gallant English went to revenge the death of several Merchants, and many brave Sea-men of all Nations, which the Spaniards did surprize in those Seas; and who they did decoy and attract by specious promises, that they would not mischief them: Notwithstand∣standing the Law of Nations, and the Faith which they had plighted, they seized their ships; and having tyed the men alive to trees, placed this Superscription on their Breasts, Who sent for you into this Countrey? And let them there starve to death, whilest the Birds of the Air did feed upon their flesh as they were yet alive. And also Flanders, the Sea whereof like unto a sharp humour, did alwayes nourish the wounds and incurable evils, she never was in so fair a way to recover her perfect health by the neigh∣bourly refreshments which England at present doth profer unto her, and the fresh Air which France would also have her enjoy. Nor was the French letting her blood sufficient to cure her, for she needed an English Physician who was ac∣customed to cure and treat incurable bodies; so that in case this unfortunate fair one will in the least conform her self to those Remedies which are profered unto her, and the which will be no violenter then she her self pleaseth; she may be rendred plump and well liking, as the fresh Air and Blossoms of France can make her, and as the Sweets and Delicacies of England can procure unto her. In like manner, it was a high point of Gene∣rosity
in the English, since they caused France to lose Graveling and Dunkirk, to help France a∣gain to re-take such places in those parts as might repay them with use, and elsewhere also, such as might stand them in as great stead; as Montmedy, which was the first considerable re∣duced place after this happy Alliance, and the which crowned the same. And truly here we may consider the Genero∣sity of his late Highness, in its most perfect dye or luster; for without having regard to those Advantages which Spain might render him as to the Commerce, the places of Hostage which she profered to put into his hands for secure Re∣treats, as Graveling, Dunkirk, and others; he was swayed by those Resentments which the English Nation ought to have harboured for the several and innumerable injuries and wrongs sustained by that Nation; as the Spanish intend∣ed Invasion with their great Fleet in 88. Their Tyranny in the Indies, and the Cruelties and Barbarismes which they inflict upon all those who will not acquiess unto, and follow their Maximes and Opinions. His late Highness there∣fore preferred the Alliance and League with France because it was more Christian-like, per∣mitting all men to make use of that Liberty of Conscience and Freedom, which Jesus Christ hath acquired unto them by his Blood; and gaining them by meekness and courteousness to his Divine example, and not by Cruelties and Oppressions.
His late Highness sided with France the ra∣ther, because she hath undertaken the Defence of all oppressed people, as well Princes as Sub∣jects. And to alledge all in one word, and so to compleat the height of Generosity it self; be∣cause France at that time was the weakest, as being abandoned by some of her ancient Allies, and as it were quite disordered by an intestine War, which had most violently shaken her bow∣els; so likewise must France needs confess, that without the assistance of England, her Naviga∣tion was totally ruined; the Pyrats of Dunkirk having blocked up all her Sea Ports, in so much, that Merchandizes were brought in as it were by stealth; and France might have been forced to have kept but a lean Lent, all their Farms and Farmers being destroyed; their Butter, Cheese, and all kinde of Spices and other Wares of that nature, being set at such rates as the Common people were not able to pay for them: So that had not the English scoured their Seas, and driven away and chased those Pyrats which lay lurking in such neighbouring Ports, France had been in a sad condition; whereas now by the means of the English, all Forreign Nations come freely into the French Ports with their Ships and Goods. And for to increase the cour∣tesie of the English yet more to France, by sa∣ving the French the labour, charges, and haz∣zards of going to the Indies, they thence bring home unto their doors, in Exchange of their Linnen and Wines, all the good things and deli∣cacies,
which not onely the New World, but the rest of the World plentifully and abundant∣ly affords. I shall enlarge my self no further in these Political Reflections, but referre the Reader to the incomparable Work lately Printed, intitu∣led, History and Policy reviewed. FINIS.
