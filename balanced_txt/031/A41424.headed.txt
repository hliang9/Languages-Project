A CRY of the just against OPPRESSION. I the prisoner of the Lord who am now in outward bonds for con∣science sake in the common goal at Oxford, and another was put in with me for the same thing; now it lieth upon me to acquaint and publish to the whole Nation the reason and cause of our im∣prisonment, and why we suffer these hardships, and all this cru∣el usage that now we do, and I shall leave it to that pure princi∣ple of God in every sober minded man to judge whether we be not cruelly used, and unjustly dealt withal, contrary to the righ∣teous law of God, which is, that every one should do unto all men as they would be done unto themselves. IT hath pleased God of his infinite Love, Mercy and Goodnesse to my poor soul, to visit me in his tender love, when I was an enemie, and a stranger to him by wicked works; And now the Lord Jesus hath appeared in me by his Light and Spirit, and hath shewed and discovered unto me the deceit which lodged in my heart, and the evil of my wayes which I lived in, and he hath called me to repen∣tance and amendment of life, and I have owned the Call of God, and by believing, obeying and following the Light and Spirit of Christ, I have received Power from him who is the Light and Life of men, and by his light I am led out of darknesse, and out of my evil wayes, words and actions, which once I lived in before I knew the Pure appearance of the Lord Je∣sus by his Spirit in me; and by his own Power he hath brought me out of uncleannesse into holinesse, and out of the broad way wherein I was walking, going headlong to destruction, into the strait and narrow way that leads to Life and Peace which few finds▪ And by his own free grace, which hath appeared in me (which is his free gift) and hath appeared unto all men, which was (and is) the Saints Teacher) am I taught to deny my self, and all ungodlinesse and world∣ly lusts, and to live soberly, justly and righteously in this present▪ evil world, and to do unto all men as I would be done by, and Christ by his own Spirit working in me, hath destroyed the works of the Devil which was in my heart, and hath taken away my sins, and purified my heart, and reconciled me to himself, and I have true peace, joy and comfort in God, and enjoyes his pure love and presence now in my outward suffering and cruel usage which carries me above it, and makes it easie unto me; and this I do acknowledge in the fear of the Lord and to his praise, that it is the
onely work of God which he hath wrought in my heart, and in many more of his dear servants and chidren by his own spirit, for which I do in all humility return and give unto the Lord all honour and glory, praise, thanks and obedience for his everlasting love, mercy and goodnesse both to me and many others, and to him onely it doth belong now and for evermore. And now the same light which shewed unto me the evil of my wayes, lets me see that the whole World now lyeth in wickedness from the high∣est to the lowest, and is out of the fear and Council of God, and in the broad way that leads to destruction, and is not yet come to true Repent∣ance, but rather goes further from God, and groweth worse and worse, and more wicked and dark then they have been formerly, and the reason is be∣cause they hare and despise the light within them which Christ hath enlight∣ned them withal, and cals it a natural light, and so counts it a thing of nought; and this is the condemnation of all the wicked and ungodly, that light is come into the world, and shines in their hearts, and lets them see the evil of their wayes and doings, and smites and reproves them in their hearts and consciences, but they do not believe in it, neither do they obey nor follow it, but lives in disobedience and unbelief, and loves darknesse and their evil deeds better then the Light of Christ, which shews them their evil deeds, for every one that doth evil hates the light, and because people re∣ceives not the Truth in the love of it, but hates and rejects it, for these causes God hath given them over to strong delusions to believe lyes, that they all may be damned who believe not the Truth, but takes pleasure in unrighteousnesse, 2 Thes. 2. 10, 11, 12. Now the Lord of his infinite love hath redeemed me to himself out of the World, and the vain conversation of it, to serve him and do his will, (and not my own) and he hath required me to leave my native country, house, land and other things and Relations whatsoever, as to the outward, (who am a York-shire man) and to go abroad into his work and service, where he shall lead and direct me by his Spirit, and in obedience to the Lord whom I love above all other things, I have left all, and am come in∣to his work and service; and he hath sent me forth as he did many of his servants in the dayes of old, as he hath done many of his servants now at this day, to turn people from darknesse unto light, and from the power of Satan to the Power of God, that they may receive forgivenesse of their sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith which is in Christ; and by the foolishness of preaching which is counted so by the wise and learned of the world) it hath pleased God to convert many thousands, which the wise and learned by their preaching hath not done, but on the contrary, both they that are preachers and they that are their hearers sins daily and hourly, and brings Scriptures to plead for sin so long as they live upon the earth, but blessed be the Name of our God for ever, who hath turned ma∣ny thousands from darknesse to his light within, and from the power of Sa∣tan unto his power, since he hath sent forth many of his Servants (called Quakers) and by believing, obeying and following the light within, they have received power from God, and by the power of God are they led out of their ungodly wayes, and out of the vain conversation of the world, and from under the dominion of Satan, and are brought into the life and pow∣er of Truth, and can witness their sins forgiven by the Lord, and hath assu∣rance
of an Inheritance which is incorruptible, and shall never fade a∣way, which all the Children of darknesse, who hates the light of Christ within, and sayes it is a naturall light, and do not believe, obey, nor fol∣low it, shall never witnesse their sins forgiven by the Lord, neither can they have any assurance of their eternall Inheritance, so long as they continue in their sins, and in disobedience, hating and disobeying the light of Christ within, and not believing in it; and in obedience to the Lord, and according to his direction I have passed through Warwick-shire, Worcester-shire, Hereford shire, Glocester shire, and part of Northampton-shire, and so into Oxford-shire to visit the people of God, and to confirm and build them up in the most holy faith, which all the world that lieth in wickednesse is enemies to at present, and to turn people from their evill wayes to the light of Christ which shines in their hearts, which whosoever believes in it and obeys it, it will give them the light of the know∣ledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. And in all my passing through these Counties before-mentioned, I was not staid nor questioned before I came to Chadlinton in Oxford-shire, to one Benjamin Staples house, who is now prisoner with me, and the same night that I lodged at his house, the Constable of the Town with some others, came about the middle of the night to search his house, having a Warrant from those called Justices to apprehend all Rogues, Vaga∣bonds, and sturdy Beggars, and especially one Ludlow; and the Constable finding me in Bed charged the man of the house to see me forth coming in the morning, which he did, and in the morning the Constable had me to Chippin-Norton before the Commissioners, and I came before one which is called Sir William Walter, and another which is called Sir Thomas Feniston, and the man of the house went along with me, and they asked my name, and what businesse I had in that Country; I told them my name, and what my businesse was, that I was directed by the Lord to come into those parts to turn people from darknesse to light, and from the power of Satan to God, but that answer did not satisfie them, and so they tendred the Oath of Allegiance both to me and the man of the house that was with me, I told them I could not swear for Conscience sake, and the other friend said the same, and I shewed the reason why we could not, because Christ and the Apostle hath forbid it, and saith swear not at all, but in all your Communication let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, for whatsoever is more is evil; and the Apostle saith, My Brethren above all things swear not at all, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath, but let your yea be yea, and nay nay, lest you fall into condemnation; and I told them further that I loved the King and his friends, and all mens persons, and should never plot nor make insurrections, nor take up a carnal wea∣pon against any man, nor against any government, and this I promised in the presence of the Lord, and before them and many others; but nothing would satisfie them that could be spoken, except we would swear, which the aforesaid William Walter pressed often for us to do, or else we must go to prison, and so we could not, neither can we swear for, or against any for Conscience sake, it being contrary to Christs command, but shall chuse rather to suffer then disobey Christ; and so they caused each of
us a Mittemus to be made, and sent us forth-with to Oxford goal, where we now are, and this is the onely cause for which we are imprisoned, and so cruelly dealt withall by the Jaylor, his Wife, and Son, which is as fol∣loweth. Upon the 15. day of the 7. Month called by the world September, we was brought to the common goal at Oxford, and delivered up to Henry Tharpe which is now Jaylor, and presently after we came in, he comman∣ded his Son to put Irons upon me, which he did upon both my legs, as they do upon Thieves and Murderers, and one of the Irons was so strait that it hurt my leg, and put me to much pain, and one friend desired the Jaylor to let them be taken off, and wider put on. (if he would put on any) he answered, if I would give money for taking them off and putting on others, I might have it done, but I could not for Conscience sake give money for so doing, because I have done nothing whereby I de∣serve to have any lions put upon me, for it was done in wrath, and envy, and not for any just cause, and so I chuse rather to suffer then satisfie that covetous mind; and shortly after the Irons was put on, they put me and the other friend into a stinking room, where was nothing neither to sit down, nor lie upon, but the cold floor, and one friend asked the Jay∣lor if he would suffer a little straw to be brought into the room for us to lye down upon, but he would not suffer it, and except we would give four shillings eight pence every week for our lodging onely, we could have no other place, and so we chose rather to suffer this hard ship, then to uphold such great oppression; and when they could not prevail with us to give them so much money as is before mentioned for our lodging, then the Jaylors wise was full of wrath, and envy, and pushed me to and fro, and abused me both by words and actions; and there are some other friends which are prisoners now, and hath been above two years for Con∣science sake, because they cannot pay Tythes, which Christ came to end; and the Jaylors Son is so very wicked and cruel, that he strikes them with his hands, and kicked one of them with his foot, and abuseth both them and us very much with his evil tongue, calling us Dogs, and De∣vils, and many more wicked words, which we bear and suffer patiently for Christs sake, and we shall not render evill for evill, but take all things pa∣tiently which is done unto us, knowing of a Truth, that they that are thus cruell against us without a cause, are led and guided by the same Spirit that murdered Christ Jesus the Lord of Glory, because he testified and declared against the world that their deeds was evill, therefore they hated him, and sought false witnesse against him, and mocked and abu∣sed him, and afterward put him to death, and the servants of the Lord are not greater then their Master, for if they called the Master of the house Belzebub, and many other wicked names, what will they not do to them of his houshold, and all that follows Christ for their example, and comes to live a holy, godly, and harmlesse life, must expect to suffer per∣secution by this wicked and perverse generation; for they that walked after the flesh in all ages, ever hated and persecuted them that walked after the Spirit, even so it is with this generation as it was formerly; but blessed be the Name of our God that gives us patience, and counts us
worthy to suffer for his Names sake, for he hath not called us onely to believe, but also to suffer with him, and he that denyes to suffer with him and for his sake, shall never reign with him. Now hearken O ye Rulers of the earth, what the Spirit of Truth saith unto you through his Servant; (King, Parliament, and Counsel) if you do not cause these things to be amended, and stop persecution, but tole∣rate, uphold and encourage those that are in authority under you to act thus cruelly against Gods people, as they have done against us for abiding in the Doctrine of Christ; or if you your selves who are Chief in Autho∣rity make Lawes, or cause any unjust Lawes which is contrary to the righteous Law of God to be put in execution, on purpose whereby to persecute and ensnare the people of God, because we cannot for Con∣science sake satisfie and obey your wills, contrary to the will and mind of Christ, then this I do declare unto you by the Spirit of the Lord, that the Lord is arisen and will plead our cause, and he will appear on our be∣half against you and overthrow you, as he hath done many that was in authority before you (which thought themselves a wife and as strong as you) because they acted against God, his People and his Truth, and hated reproof and Instruction, and cast the righteous Law of God behind their backs, and counted it a thing of nought, and made unjust Lawes in their own corrupt wills against the servants of Christ, contrary to the pure Law of God; and much cruelty they acted against Gods people, and per∣sisted in it, and would take no counsell nor warning at the Servants of the Lord, which was sent to warn and to tell them, if they did not repent and turn to God, from their ungodly wayes, and cease persecuting the people of God, the Lord would appear against them and overthrow them, and bring his Judgements upon them, but instead of repenting and turn∣ing from their wickednesse to God, and taking Counsel at his Servants, they consulted together how to ensnare us, and to destroy both our per∣sons and estates, and so they was all warned, and left without excuse, but they would take no warning before the Lord appeared against them and overthrew them; and I do verily believe that the wickednesse which they acted against Gods people called Quakers, was the chief cause why God hath overthrown them, and brought misery upon them. And now you are brought into Power and Authority, and you have a day and a time put into your hands, and God will try you whether you will act for him and deny your selves, and seek his Honour and Glory on∣ly, or whether you will set up your selves and your own interests, and seek your own honour and glory; Verily I say unto you, if you fllow the exam∣ple of them that was in authority before you, in life and practice, setting up your selves and seeking your own honour and glory (as they did) and not the honour and glory of God only, but persecute and uphold perse∣cution, and make a prey upon the people of God, (as they did) then will God be avenged on you, and bring his just judgements upon you, for God will avenge his own Elect, which call and cry to him day and night, and we shall not avenge our selves, nor seek revenge of any one whatsoe∣ver they do unto us, but shall leave it to the Lord our God, for in him only is our trust and confidence; And we do verily believe if we abide
faithfull to the Lord, he will never leave us, nor forsake us, but every authority that rises up against us to persecute us, or destroy us in our per∣sons and estates, God will overthrow them by his own power; for God hath respect unto his own people for they are near and dear unto him, and whatsoever is done unto them, he takes it as done unto himself; Therefore fear God and take counsel of him, and then you may expect to prosper, and the blessing of the Lord will be amongst you, but if ye do not take coun∣sell of God, but at your own evil hearts, then you cannot have the bles∣sing of the Lord, neither can you prosper long; For wo unto them that take counsel but not of me saith the Lord, Isa. 30. 1. Now if ye take counsel of God, you will never persecute any man for his religion, nor for the exer∣cise of a good Conscience towards God, for God never counselled any man to persecute, neither was the saints and servants of God any persecutors, but they themselves was persecuted by the wicked priests and rulers, for o∣beying the Lord, (as we are now) & persecutors in all ages was enemies to Christ, and Christ tells them they were of their father the devil, John 8. 44. And so is all persecutors now, and are no saints, nor servants of God, neither are they true Christians, nor any true believers, but are enemies to Christ, let them profess what they wil; therefore take warning betime before it be too late, and cease persecuting Gods people, and put a stop to it, least the Judge∣ments of God come upon you at unawares; & strive not in your wills against the truth of God, For verily, I do declare unto you and unto all the World, (that shall read this) that this is the truth of the onely true God, which the people called Quakers holds forth in doctrine, life, and practise, and shall stand for ever, and you cannot overthrow it, for the Lord God is on our side, and he hath determined that this everlasting truth (which is of himself) shall prosper, flourish, grow and increase, and God will add dayly more and more unto his Church such as shall be saved, and this truth will spread throughout the World, and God will Overturn, Overturn, until he come to Rule and Reign whose right it is, even the Lord Jesus Christ who is King of kings, and Lord of lords, who will rule the Nations with a rod of Iron. and all that will not have him to rule over them, neither will be subject to his Government, shall be confounded, and he will break them to pieces like a potters vessel, for his kindom over all must be set up and exalted, and righteousnesse must be established in the earth, and the king∣dom of Antichrist brought down, and the upholders of it, and all the builders of Babel which rejects and dispiseth the chief Corner-stone shall be confounded, and this certainly will God bring to pass in his own time; therefore it is in vain for you, or any others to go about to set up and esta∣blish that which God will destroy, or to go about to pull down that which God hath determined to set up and uphold; now if you can hinder the Sun Moon and Stars, for shining in the Firmament, or the winde for blo∣wing, or the Sea for ebbing and flowing, then may you hinder the work of the Lord, and his truth for spreading, and you may as well go about to do the one as the other. Now in the fear of the Lord, and in obedience to his will I have warned you, and you are left without excuse, whether you will hear or forbear, I have discharged a good conscience towards you, in acquainting of you what the Lord hath revealed unto me by his Spirit concerning you, if you persist in wickedness, spending your pre∣cious
time in Pride, Pleasures and Vanity, satisfying the lusts of the flesh, and take counsel of that wicked spirit which works in a my∣stery in your hearts, (and in all the hearts of the children of diso∣bedience) and so make laws, or put any unjust lawes in executi∣on whereby to destroy the Innocent, then will you be found guil∣ty before the Lord of their blood, which will lie heavy upon you; And so by doing these things you will provoke the Lord to anger, and he will appear against you, and bring his fierce judgments upon you, and cut you off suddenly from off the face of the earth, and give you your portion with the wicked and ungodly, where there will be weeping and and wailing and gnashing of teeth; Therefore, as you tender the good of your own souls and the glory of God, let Gods people have their liber∣tie to worship him in spirit, and in truth, and to exercise a good conscience towards the Lord, and do not go about to limmit the holy One, but let the Spirit of truth have its free liberty to declare through the Lords Servants and Prophets, and do not persecute them that do you no wrong, nor harm neiher in your persons, nor estates, but desires the good and welfare both of your souls and bodies, and the good of all men; But we cannot for con∣science sake give flattering titles to man, least for so doing our Maker soon take us away, Job 32. 21, 22, Neither can we respect mens persons (for if we do) we deny the faith of Christ, and become transgressors of the righte∣ous Law of God, Jam. 2. Neither can we satisfie the wills and mindes of men, contrary to the will and mind of God, and where God commands one thing, and a man another, we shall chuse rather to obey God then man; now if you persecute us for these things before mentioned, we shall suffer unjustly by you, and we shall have peace with the Lord in our suf∣ferings, and we shall be justified in his sight, when you will be condemn∣ed by Gods witnesse in your own consciences for so acting against us; therefore repent and fear the Lord, and deny your selves, and your own honour and glory, and rule for God, and aim at his honour and glory on∣ly, and turn to him with all your hearts, and cease to do evil and learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed and take off their heavie burdens, that God may have mercy upon your poor souls; and re∣member your latter ends, for you must all give an account to the just God for the deeds you do in your life time, and every one must be rewarded according to your deeds, without respect of persons, and for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account in the day of Judgment; and see now that for the time to come ye walk more circumspectly then you do (or have done) not as fools, but as wise men, guided by the wisdom of God in all things, that so you may redeem your precious time which formerly you have spent in pride and vanity, and in satisfying the lusts of the flesh, to the great dishonour of God, Ephe. 5. 15, 16 17, 18. and now begin to bring forth the fruits of Holinesse and Righteousnesse, and do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly before the Lord, that God Al∣mighty may be honoured and glorified by you (and in you) and this the Lord requires of every one of you from the highest to the lowest, and if you do not do these things, you do not answer the end for which you are created, and brought into the world.
And now while you have time prize it, for this is the day of your visi∣tation, and do not despise and reject the Counsel of the Lord, through his poor despised servant, (for if you do) and count it a thing of nought, and continue in your evill wayes, and persecuting the Servants of the Lord, verily I declare unto you by the Spirit of Truth, that God will despise and reject both you and your prayers, and all the prayers of them that pray for you, and he will not hear them, and you cannot escape the wrath of the Almighty, so long as your hands are full of blood, and your hearts full of Iniquity, Isaiah 1. 15, 16, 17. Written in the Common Goal at Oxford, the 20th. day of the 7th. Month, 1660. From one who desires the good and welfare of all, and not the destruction of any in their sins, but rather that they may come to repentance, and live; who am known by the name Thomas Goodaire. The End. LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the signe of the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1660.
