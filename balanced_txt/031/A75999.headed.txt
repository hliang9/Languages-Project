Decemb: 9th  monday 1644 Alas pore Parliament, how are thou betrai'd? This is the Plot the Kings party boasted of, that should take whe∣ther God would or no: You see though they care not what they speake,: yet they know what they speake. Wee have brave Generalls that fight for the King, and make pore ho∣nest people pay for their owne destructions: One of them hath wrought finely in the darke a l while like a Divell, but the other hath shew'd himsee an open enemie, and therefore is the more to be borne with; he hath made use of Rouges, Cutpurses, Players,  and Tinkers to for∣ward a Reformation, and the other hath culd out all the honestest Youth in the Kingdome to keep them from Acti∣on, or for slaughter. Neither of them worke, but make worke; when they should doe, they undoe, and indeed to undoe is all the marke they aime at. Doe yee thinke Great∣nesse without Goodnesse can ever thrive in excellent actions? no, Honour without honesty stinkes: away with't: no more Lords and yee love me, they smell o'the Court.
