TO THE READER. AMongst the ma∣ny miseries that haue light vpon vs by the fall of our first parents, those of the soule are chiefest; and amongst them, this is not the least, that though we be conuinced by the Word and Spirit, to be forlorne crea∣tures, yet we naturally shun to take any knowledge thereof.
No man is rocked so fast asleepe in the cradle of secu∣ritie, but at one time or an∣other, this alarum rings in his eares:Rom. 3.19, 2. Eccle 11 9. & 12.14. Thou hast sin∣ned, and therefore must come to iudgement. But who trembleth in himselfe at the sound thereof, that he might finde rest in the day of trouble?Hab. 3.16. It cannot bee, but these troubled thoughts will now and then fasten vpon the most hard-hearted and impenitent sinner;Dan 5.6. Act. 24.26. surely all things are not wel be∣tweene God and me; and, what will become of me another day?1 Pet. 4.10. And yet
where is he for all that, who will presently fall to sear∣ching & iudging of him∣selfe,Lam. 3.40. 1 Cor. 11.3. that he might not be iudged of the Lord? No, the heart of man is natural∣ly swolne with such a diuel∣lish pride,Rom. 8.7, 8. Isai, 65.2. that though hee know God is, and will bee, his Iudge,Rom. 2.16. yet will hee not make supplication to his Iudge.Iob 9.15. 1 Pet. 5.5, 6 And albeit we know that GOD resisteth the proud, and hath decreed in himselfe to staine all the glory thereof;Isa. 23.9. Dan. 4.34. yet walke we on still in our pride, against him. But who was euer fierce against him and prospered?1 Cor. 10.22. Iob 9.4.
Thou then that art as yet in thy naturall estate, I wish thee in the name of GOD, speedily to examine thy selfe vpon thy bed:Psal. 6.4. Zeph. 2.1. and betweene the Lord and thee, propound these que∣stions to thy soule; Soule, what saist thou to the guilt of Adams sinne?Rom. 5.12. It is imputed to thee, I pray thee how shall wee answer it? Thou know∣est that this guilt binds vs ouer to eternal death,Rom. 5.16. & 6.23. Psal. 139.7. 2. Cor. 5.10. there is no fleeing for vs, from the face of the Iudge, what shall be∣come of thee and me,Act. 17.31. in the day of the Lords
wrath? Thou knowest, that all our righteousnes is but as filthy clouts,Isai. 64.6. Iob 14.4. Psal. 67.7. & how shall wee be able to stand before the Lords pure eyes,Hab. 1.13. which can be∣hold no impurity? Thou knowest also that our sinnes are aboue mea∣sure sinfull, yea,Ezra 9.6. farre exceeding the sands of the sea,Rom 7.13. both for weight and number;Psal. 40.11. Psal. 38.4. must they not needs then sinke vs to hell, without recoue∣ry? For Gods sake (O my soule) let vs looke a∣bout vs, & whilst space,Reuel. 221. place, and meanes are allotted vs,Isai. 55.6. ponder wee
seriously these things in time. Let vs, I pray thee, take vnto vs words, and now,Hos. 14.2. euen now turne a∣gaine vnto the LORD, from whom wee haue too too long,Isa. 53.6. most wo∣fully erred: Beseech we him, that he would take away all iniquity and receiue vs graciously, that wee may eur here∣after render him the calues of our lips. Thus or in the like man∣ner, should euery one that meane to escape the iudge∣ment of GOD,Rom 2.30 and the iust damnation of hell,Mat. 23.33. question and reason with
his owne soule. For it is not the guiltlesse,Luk. 15.18, 19. & 18.13. but the guiltie, that prizeth a par∣don; it is not the whole, but the sicke,Mat 9.2. that is glad of the Physician: So, if sin make thee not sicke at the very heart,Act. 2.37.4.38. thou wilt not esteeme of Christ, nor of the saluation which hee hath brought for all broken-hearted sinners,Luk. 4.18. no more than of a rush.Math. 22.5. A little to helpe thee then, that hast not yet felt th spirituall sicknesse (and also somewhat to refresh the memory of thse who haue) here is in a short summe dis∣couered vnto thee, some of
the maladies of thy soule, shewing thee how Christ is both the Physician, and me∣dicine of them seuerally, as the title giuen to the Booke, None but Christ, none but Christ, giues thee to vnderstand. Touching the which, if thou wouldest I should yeeld thee a reason; then know, that I tooke it not vp at randome; but as I found them the words, and those the last words of a constant Martyr of Christ, Iohn Lambert by name; which (as I conceiue) beeing vt∣tered by him, as the trium∣phant voice of faith, after
that hee had, through the power of Christ, put to flight the feare of Hell, Sinne, and Death, &c. (as by dou∣bling of them may appeare) So by way of imitation, I thinke them (not tying any to sillables) well beseeming the thoughts, and speeches also of euery Christian, vp∣on safe and sure grounds, as in their dayly, so euen in their last conflicts to be ta∣ken vp and vsed. Not as if heereby it were my mea∣ning to exclude,See Ioh. 3.16. Titus 3.5. or shut out either the Father, or the ho∣ly Ghost, from hauing an hand in the worke of our sal∣uation, as well as Christ:
but attributing the same to him onely,Rom. 8.34 as to the sole meritorious cause thereof: And so I bid thee hearti∣ly farewell. Thine in Christ, C.C.

trembleth at thy word. So as in mee (sweet Lord) is now fulfilled the saying that is written, the sacri∣fices of a contrite spirit and a broken heart thou neither hast nor neuer wilt despise.Psal. 51.17. Well may I now say, that thy name to mee (a desolate wretch) hath beene as an ointment poured out;Cant. 1.3. and therefore hath thy seruant out of the abundance of his heart, found in his heart; after this sort,2 Sam. 7.27. to expresse and poure forth the loue and thankefulnesse of his soule,Luk. 7.47. vnto thee. To thee therefore O Father of mercies, and
God of all comfort and consolation,2 Cor. 1.3. who hast so loued mee vnworthy,Ioh. 3.16. & 1.18. as out of thine owne bo∣some to send thy onely begotten Sonne, for mee and all mankinde lost, in∣to the world,Gal. 4.4. made of a woman, that thus hee might become our true and very Immanuel, Mat. 1.23. And to thee O Lord Iesus Christ,Ioh. 10.18. who vo∣luntatily laidest downe thy life for mee to pre∣serue mee from eternall death. And to thee also O holy Spirit, by whose
diuine light my blinde eyes haue beene illumi∣nated to see (as by the Law,Eph. 1.17, 18. Rom. 3.23. 1 Ioh. 3.1. Ephes. 2.4. & 3.19. my wofull misery) so comfortably by the Gospell, to behold this superexcellent, and sur∣passing loue and mercie of the Father, and the Sonne; and thereto hast wrought that wonder∣full grace of Faith in my heart,Rom. 10.17 to beleeue that all this loue is and hath bin extended to me as wel as to any other,Gal. 2.20. yea that it hath bin by thee, O bles∣sed Spirit shed abroad abundantly in my heart,Rom. 5.5. and hast so sealed mee vp
to the day of redēption, that I shall not so vncom∣fortably,Ephe. 1.13. & 4.30. as formerly I haue done, call into que∣stion the certainty and assurance of my free a∣doption.Gal. 4.6. To Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost (I say) one diuine Essence, three di∣stinct persons, be ascri∣bed in heauen and earth, by Angels and men, as is most due, all wisedome. power, praise, and glory, eternally, Amen, and Amen.
A NECESSARIE aduertisement to the Reader. AS it is an infal∣lible truth, that neither a mans person,Gen 4.4. Rom 8.8. Heb. 11.4. Ioh. 14.6. nor acti∣ons, can please God, till himselfe be in Christ; so it is as true,2 Cor. 3.5. that a man hath neither ability of himselfe to doe good, or abstaine from euill a∣right, vnlesse hee be as∣sisted by the power of Christ: and this appea∣reth, both by the testi∣mony of Christ himself,
Ioh. 15.5. For without me yee can doe nothing; (as also by the testimony of Paul, who saith, that by the power of Christ, he was a∣ble to doe all things, Phil 4.13. Implying (accor∣ding to that place of Iohn) that without Christs power,Ioh. 15.5. he could doe nothing. Doth the power and strength of corruption then any way annoy thee,Rom. 7.23. and wouldest thou faine get the masterie ouer the same? flie then foorthwith out of thy selfe, and get thee direct¦ly vnto Christ,Rom. 7.24, 25. and say
thus vnto him; Lord, thou biddest mee morti¦fie al inordinate lusts and affections, as wrath,Col. 3.5. vn∣cleannes, couetousnesse, &c. But thou knowest there is no strength in me to mortifie these, nor any corruption of nature besides,See 2 C. 20.12. further foorth than I haue assistance from thee:Phil. 4.13. & 2.13. Rom. 6.6. apply there∣fore to this viciousnesse of my sinfull nature, the vertue of thy precious death and buriall, by the worke of thy holy spirit,Rom. 8.13. which alone is able to kill sinne in me, that sin and corruption (of what
nature soeuer) may not as heeretofore rule nor raigne ouer me,Rom. 6.12. but that wageing battaile still by thy strēgth ther-against, I may yet therein haue peace,1 Ioh. 5..5 and expect the full victory, in the time thou hast appointed. Also, wouldest thou heare, reade, meditate, or pray profitably; thinke how insufficient thou art,2 Cor. 3.5. as of thy selfe, to per∣forme these holy exerci¦ses, or any the like, with outWhose pow¦er, in this case, must be perfected in thy weak¦nesse, or it will not be. 2 Cor. 12.9. Christ; but hasten immediately to him, and say, It is meet (Lord) that I doe these duties at
thy command,Isai. 55 3. Reu. 1.3. 1 The. 5.17 for in mercy thou hast appoin∣ted them for my good: but without thee,Ioh. 15.5 thou knowest I can doe no∣thing: Oh let me there∣fore feele power and ver∣tue (by the worke of thy spirit) as from thy death to mortifie and kill all sinne in me,Rom 6.5.6 Col. 2 12. so from thy resurrection, both to quicken and enable mee aright to performe all such duties as thou re∣quirest of mee, that the power of effecting all good, may alwaies be of thee, and not from mee, 2 Cor. 4.7.
And yet euen in this re∣gard thou requirest of mee as in other things, that as a poore fraile ves∣ssell I should put foorth all the powers of body and soule,Eccle. 9.10 2 Cor. 7.1. 2 Pet. 1.2.10. Mat. 25 14. 10 30. wherewith thou hast endowed me; the better heereby to serue thy diuine proui∣dence. Phil. 2.12, 13. Now (good Reader) if thou approuest of this aduertisement in thy iudgement, I pray thee giue thy diligence to bring it by degrees but vnto a daily practise (for thou shalt haue need of it daily) and by goo
experience, thou shalt in the end finde, I hope, that the gaine will counteruaile the paine.1 Cor. 15.58. Gal. 6.9.
HEREVNTO IS added, three steps to sound conuersion. 1 Act. 26.17.18.FIrst, God by his word and spirit, enlighte∣neth the vnderstanding of a sinner truely to con∣ceiue the doctrine of mans misery, and of his full recouery by Christ. 2 Secondly, by the same meanes he workes in his heart both such sound sorrow for his mi∣sery, and feruent desire after Christ the remedy,Act. 2.7.
that hee can neuer be at quiet, till hee enioy Christ. 3 Thirdly, GOD so manifesteth his loue in freely offering Christ with all his benefits,Ioh. 3.16. vn∣to him a poore sinner lost, that thereby hee drawes him in such wise to giue credit vnto God heerein, that hee gladly accepts of Christ offered vnto him. These three workes of God, whosoeuer finds to haue bin truly wrought in himselfe; may there∣by know certainly,1 Ioh. 5.10 that
hee hath true faith,Act. 15.9. and therefore sound conuer∣sion. Now hauing obtained this mercy at the hands of Almighty God for the merit of Christ;Col. 1.12. Ephes. .5. Luke 1.74. hee ought in thankefulnesse to him therefore endea∣uour daily euer after,Tit. 2.11, 12. in his whole conuersation, to expresse and shew forth the vertues of him that hath thus called him out of darknesse,2 Pet. 2.9. into his maruellous light.
THE SECOND PART: CONTAINING A PASSIONATE Prayer to Christ: With his gracious an∣swer thereto. ISAI. 65.24. Before they call, I will an∣swere. O Christ, who art my Lord, and my God:Ioh. 20.28. thou who art
the promised seed, Gen. 3.15.Gen. 22.18 in whom all the Nations of the earth should be blessed:Mich. 5.2 thou, whose goings forth haue beene of old from euer∣lasting:Ier. 23.6. Thou, who art called the Lord our righ∣teousnesse, and Sonne of righteousnesse, Mal. 4.2. and art worthily stiled. Wonderful,Isai 9.6. Counsellor, The mighty God, the euerlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Thou in whom the Father is well pleased:Mat. 3.17. and in whom his soule deligh∣teth:Isai. 42.1. Thou who art the blessed, Tim. 6.15. and only Poten∣tate,
the King of Kings, & Lord of Lords, Thou who art the Prince of life, Act. 3.15.1 Cor 2.8. and Lord of Glory: who art sa∣ued thy selfe, Zache. 9.9. and art mighty to saue. Isai. 63.1. O thou who, who art white and rud∣die,Cant. 5.10. the fairest among ten thousand: who art that Immanuel, euen God with vs, Isai. 7.14. who art giuen to mee,Isai. 9.6. wert borne for me: who hast loued mee,Gal 1 20. and gi∣uen thy selfe for me. Oh when wilt thou draw mee,Cant. 1.4. that I may runne after thee? When shall I
see thee?Isai 64.1. Ioh. 14.23. Oh when wilt thou come vnto mee; abide,Ver. 21. and shew thine owne selfe vnto mee? When O good Christ, wilt thou giue mee an heart to know thee?Ier. 24.17. Oh that thou wouldest once circumcise mine heart to loue thee,Deut. 30.6. that in loue it might euer and in all things,1 The. 5.18 be praising of thee! When shall I feele thee,Col. 3.11. to bee all in all vnto mee? my Hus∣band, Hosea. 2.19. my Head, Ephes. 5.23. my Surety, Heb. 7.22. my Sauiour, Luke 1.47. my light, Iohn 8.12. and
my life? Col. 3.4. Shall I neuer haue an heart to beleeue in thee,Ro. 10.10. and as to loue,2 Tim. 4.8. so to looke and long for thy blessed ap∣pearing? 2 Pet. 3.12.Col. 2.3. In thee, Lord, are hid, all the treasures of wise∣dome, and knowledge. When shall I feele thee to be to mee, as thou art to all thine,1 Cor. 1.30 my wise∣dome, righteousnesse, sanctification and re∣demption? It pleased the Father, that in thee,Col. 1.19. my Lord and my God, should all fulnesse dwell: Oh when wilt thou then, fill me with all ioy
and peace in beleeuing?Rom. 15.13 Thou rellest mee Lord, that all power is giuen thee in heauen and in earth.Mat. 8.18. Oh that thou then wouldest giue mee such a powerfull faith,2 Thes. 1.11 as by deriuing and drawing vertue from thee, might bee of power to purifie my heart to worke by loue,Act. 15.9. Gal. 5.6. and to ouercome the world, 1 Ioh. 5.4. When shall I feele thee my Lord and my God; dwelling in my heart by faith?Ephes. 3.17. Then should I hate the euill and loue the good.Amos 5.15. Then should I feare thee for thy good∣nesse,Hos. 3.5.
and sing aloud of thy righteousnesse.Psal. 145.7. Then should I not suffer sinne so to raigne in my mor∣tall body,Rom. 6.12. that at any time I should obey it in the lusts thereof. Then should I lament, that I can lament no more the selfe-loue, diffidence,Ier. 31.18. and impenitency, of my self-louing, vnbeleeuing,Heb. 3.12. and impenitent heart, Rom. 2.5. Thou Lord hast done,Isai. 26.12. and yet doest all my workes in mee, and for me. Giue me then,Rom. 8.26. the spirit of Prayer, of pow∣er, of loue,2 Tim 1.1.7 and of a sound minde: Euen the
Spirit of Adoption,Rom. 8.15. by which I may cry Father,Gal. 4 6. Ephe. 4.30. and so be sealed vp vnto the day of redemption. Thy pure and precious blood, O blessed Lord Iesus, once shed, hath a iustifying, Rom. 5.9. a purifying, Heb. 9.14. and sanctifying vertue, Heb. 12.12. By the merit ther∣of then,1 Thes. .10. sweet Lord, doe thou saue mee from the wrath to come. Through it purge my conscience defiled,Heb. 9.4. from dead works to serue thee the liuing and the True God: and through it, so consecrate and set me apart as a ves∣sell
vnto honour sancti∣fied,1 Tim. 2.21. that it may be meet for thee my Lord and Masters vse, as also ready and prepared vnto euery good worke.Tit: 3.1. Giue me to be wise vnto that which is good,Rom. 16.19 and simple con∣cerning euill.1 Cor. 14.20. In malice giue me to be child-like; but in vnderstanding to bee of a ripe age. And now, my Lord and my God,Isai. 66 8. who is like vnto thee forgiuing iniquity, transgression, and sinne, Exod. 34.7. And there∣fore my soule panteth after thee;Psal. 42.2. my soule thir∣steth for thee:and 63 1. and flesh
longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty lād, where no water is.Psal. 101.2 Psal. 73.25. Oh when, when wilt thou come vnto me? I haue none in heauen but thee, & there is none vpon earth that I desire besides thee.Psal. 13.1. Wilt thou, O Lord, forget mee for euer? And wilt thou hēce forth shew mee no more fauour?Psal. 77.7. Psal. 89.47 Oh remember how short my time is. Thou wilt at length, I know, return and reuiue me;Psal. 71.20 thou wilt come a∣gain,Psal. 138.7. and bring me from the depth of the earth. O Lambe of God, Ioh. 1.29. Sonne of God, Ioh. 3.
18. O my Mercy seat, Exod. 25.17. my Media∣tor, 1 Tim 2.5. and Ad∣uocate, 1 Ioh. 2.1. When shall I with the residue of thy louers, possesse and inioy thee? How long, Lord, shall it bee, before with thine ele∣cted & betrothed Spouse I shall bee able to say,1 Pet. 2.. Hos. 2.9. that thou my beloued art mine, and I thine.Cant. .. Then, then shouldst thou as a bundle of sweete smelling Myrrh,Cant. 1.13 lie e∣uen al the night long be¦tweene my brests, and dwel between my shoul∣ders, Deuteronom. 32.12.
Thou camest into the world,1 Tim 1.15 Lord, to saue sin∣ners: And wilt not thou saue me?1 Ioh. 3.5. Thou wast made manifest, that thou migh¦test take away sins: And wilt not thou, O Lambe of God, take away mine? Thou wert manifest to that end,1 Iohn 3.8. that thou migh¦test destroy the works of the Diuell: And wilt not thou Lord, now destroy all his workes in mee? Thou didst in the dayes of thy flesh once suffer for sins,1 Pet. 3.18 that thou migh∣test bring mankind lost vnto God: And wilt not thou, my deare Christ,
bring mee now to thy heauenly Father washed, Reu. 1.5. iustified, Rom. 5.1. reconciled, 1 Ioh. 4.10. sanctified, 1 Corinth. 6.11. and eternally saued? Heb. 5.9. Yes, Lord, I beleeue it.Mar. 9.24. But Lord helpe thou mine vnbeliefe. I reade in the Euangelists how often thy compassions were mooued,Mat. 9.30.14.14. and 15.32. Mar. 1.41. and 5.19. Luk. 7.13. ouer the miseries of men and wo∣men. Are they not the same now, they were then? Hadst thou com∣passions for them, & hast thou none for me? was thy soule troubled for them,Ioh. 12.27. and not likewise
for mee? was thy so exceeding sorrowful  to death for them,Mar. 14.34 Mat. 4.5. & wa it not so for mee? Didst thou fast,Luk. 21 4 Heb. 5.7. swear, weepe, cry, and pray? and were not all these thy pssio for me? Oh thou that a holy, harmlesse, vndefi∣led,Heb. 7.25, 26. separate from sin∣ners, and made highe then the heauens; who art able to saue to the vttermost all them that come vnto God by thee how long, oh how long shall it be, yer I feele and finde in my selfe the ver∣tue and efficacie (from the throne of grace) ofHeb. 4.14, 15, 16.
thine intercess on for me! Which though for the present, I beleeue not as I should, yet Lord, giue mee to beleeue it when thou wilt.Psal. 34 5. Who euer tru∣sted in thee, and was a∣shamed?Psal. 22.5. who euer hoped in thee, and was con∣founded? No, no,Psal. 22.3. thou inhabitest the praises of Israel. It is thou, Lord,Psal. 65.2. that hearest prayer, vnto thee there∣fore shall all flesh come. Diddest not thou, my Lord and my God, in the dayes of thy flesh, testi∣fie, that if thou wert lifted vp from the earth,Ioh. 12.32, 33
thou wouldest draw a men vnto thee. Oh cause the coards and bands of this thy infinite and sur¦passing loue in dying for mee,Hos. 11.4. effectually to draw my whole soule and affe∣ctions vnto thee. Oh when shal I be with thee wher thou art,Ioh. 17.24. that I ma see that thy glory. In the mean while,Cant. 2.5, 6 O my deare heauenly husband, stay mee with flagons, com∣fort me with apples, for I am sicke of loue. Le thy left hand bee vn∣der my head, and let thy right hand imbrace mee:Cant. 1.3. kisse thou mee, O
my Christ, with the kis∣ses of my mouth, for thy loues are better then wine.
1 CHRIST his gracious Answere. Pro. 8.17.I Loue them that loue mee, and those that seeke me early, shall find: whoso findeth mee,Vers. 35. fin∣deth life, and shall ob∣taine fauor of the Lord. Bee of good cheere then, thou fainting soule, for I haue heard thee,Hos. 14.8. and ob∣serued thee. And though I bee the high and loftie one,Isai. 57.15. that inhabiteth the eternity, whose Name is Holy, dwelling in the high and holy place, yet doe I also dwell with
them that are of a con∣trite and humble spirit, to reuiue the spirit of the humble, and to re∣uiue the heart of the con∣trite ones.Isai. 30.1 I will be gra∣cious vnto thee at the voice of thy cry, I haue heard thee, and will an∣swer thee. Because thou hast set thy loue vpon me,Psal. 98.14. therefore I will deli∣uer thee, I will set thee on high, because thou hast knowne my Name. Yea, hee that loueth mee,Ioh. 14.21. shall bee also lo∣ued of my Father, and I, according to thy re∣quest, will manifest mine
owne selfe vnto thee: ve∣ry meet it is that all men should honour the Son,Isai. 49.14. euen as they honour the Father; for hee that ho∣noureth not the Sonne, honoureth not the Fa∣eher which sent him, Iohn 5.23. And though to thy seeming, thou art now and then neglected of mee; yet can I not for∣get thee ouer-long,Isai. 54.7. it is but for a moment; for, for a small moment haue I forsaken thee, but with euerlasting compassions will I haue mercy vpon thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.Psal. 84.11. I wil be both
Sunne and shield vnto thee, I will giue grace and glory; nor shall any good thing at any time bee wanting at all vnto thee:1 Pet. 1.13. onely hope to the end, for that grace which is brought vnto thee. Humble thy selfe daily to walke in all the exer∣cises of piety and true charity.Mich. 6.8. Take vp the crosse cheerefully which I shall (it may bee) daily lay vpon thee.Luk. 9.13. And when thou art ready to sinke, come vnto me:Mat. 14.30. For I will assure thee on my faith full word, they shll not for euer bee ashamed,Isi. 49 4.
who haue the grace to wait for mee. Cast not a∣way then thy confidence which hath promise of great reward.Heb. 10.35. Poor soul, wherefore diddest thou doubt?Mat. 14.31. But I see thou hast neede of patience,Heb. 10.36 that after thou hast en∣deuoured to doe my will heere on earth, thou mightest receiue the promise.Luk. 21.2. By patience therefore possesse thy soule. I will stand by thee, I will neither leaue thee, nor forsake thee, Hebrewes 13.5. Thou art as deare vnto mee,Zech. 2.8. as the apple of mine eye.
Thou shalt bee couered in the shadow of mine hand. Mine Angels shall attend thee, Psalm. 91.11.Isai. 51.16. my grace shall bee suffi∣cient for thee, my pre∣sence shall go with thee,Exo. 33.14 neither shall my Spirit nor Word depart away from thee, Isaiah 59.21. When thou art temp∣ted, I will succour thee, Hebrew. 2.18.Isai. 40.29. when thou faintest, I will sustaine thee. If thou offend a∣gainst my heauenly Fa∣ther,1 Ioh. 2.1. Rom. 8.34. the merit of my satisfaction, and inter∣cession shall euermore pleade thy cause at the
throne of grace for thee. I am returned vnto thee, Zech. 8.3. I will no more be terrible vnto thee,Ier. 17.17. Isai. 57.16. for so the Spirit should faile before me, and the soule which I haue made. Wherefore comfort thy selfe with these words:1 Thes 4.19. Goe eat thy bread with ioy, and drinke thy wine with a merry heart,Eccles. 9.7 for God now accepteth thy workes. Nor shall it bee long yer thou (with the residue of those who loue and long for my appearing) enter into thy Masters ioy,Mat. 25.21. where is fulnesse of ioy, and

To the Christian Reader. THe hand of the Lord hath been long stretched out against vs in this Citie, by sending sundry sorts of diseases and sicknesses amongst vs, where of my selfe of late haue had some experience. To may, these haue prooued mortall and deadly: and this it is that hath moued mee to pen these few lines following. I
grant they are appropriated especiall to the person of the sicke▪ yet so, that the whole should not be excluded from reaping benefit thereby, which if by Gods grace they attaine; thn haue I the end of my labour. And so I euer rest, Thy faithfull wel∣willer in Christ, C. C.
The Sicke Mans A B C. Q. WHat art thou by nature? A. Oh Sir, aRom. 5 12 sinner, aPsal. 51.5 sinner; aIob 40.4. vile and an abominable sinner, Iob 1.6. Q The soule that sin∣neth, mustEzek. 18.20. die. Thou know∣est there is no escaping for thee. A. I will not hide my sinne asIob 31.33 Adam did, but with Dauid I willPsal. 32.5. con∣fesse
it; and with Iob, I wil repent in dust and ashes for it.Iob 42.6. Q. Say thou doe so, thou art not ignorant, that sinne and death will still be dog¦ging of thee at the heeles? A. I doe not greatly feare what sinne and death can doe against me.Heb. 2.14, 15. Q. Why, I pray thee? A. Because I haue to deale with a gracious God. Q. Who told thee that? Exod. 34.6A. Euen his owne selfe. Q. Hee is also a deuou∣ring fier.Isai. 33.14. Heb. 10 27A. Hee is so, but it is
to his enemies, and to them that perish. Q. Mayst thou not also perish? A No, I cannot be∣leeue it. Q. Wherefore? A. Because Iesus Christ by his bloud, hathRom. 3.25. pacified Gods anger toward mee. Q. How could the blood of Christ effect it? A. Because hee wasAct. 20 2 God that shed it. Q. But hee shed it not for thee? A. Oh, yes, yes.1 Tim. 1.15 Q. Why for thee? A. Because Sir, I do
from the very hart root,Psa. 51.2 Luk. 18.13. long after the sauing and healing vertue of it, Eph. 1.7. 1 Iohn 1.7. Luke 8.13.Q. Possible this thy long∣ing will not be lasting? A. Yes, by Gods grace,Phil. 3.12. whilest I haue any breathing. Q. Well, I must needs thus farre (for thy com∣fort) yeeld vnto thee, that Christ, by his death, hath giuen sinne and death their doome; so as resting vpon that thou hast profes∣sed, they cannot hurt thee. But yet thou art not restored (for all that) in∣to Gods fauour, wherein
alone consisteth life, and true happinesse, Psal. 30.5. A. I expect and looke for that, onely by his2 Cor. 5.21. Rom. 8.33. and 10.4. imputing vnto me, Christs perfect righteousnesse. Q. Thou talkest of great matters; hadst thou faith to beleeue it? A.Mar. 9.2 I beleeue: Now, Lord, helpe my vnbe∣liefe. Q. I blame thee not in seeking thy Iustification from Christ but may not an hypocrite doe this as well as thou? A. I doe from my soule, as earnestly long to haue him made vnto
me,1 Cor. 1.30. Sanctification also. See Psal. 51.10. Q. How expectest thou sanctification from Christ? A. By the worke of his Spirit, 1 Cor. 6.11. Q. How doth the Spi∣rit effect it? A. By applying vnto my whole man, the pow∣er of his death and re∣surrection, Rom. 6.5, 6. by the one killing by de∣grees all sinne in me;Col. 2.11, 12, 13. by the other, quickning me vnto new obedience. Q. It seemes then, thou not onely beleeuest, that Christ will saue thee from the guilt and condem∣nation
of sinne, but will alsoTit. 2.14. deliuer thee from the power and bondage of sinne. A. That is my beliefe indeed, 1 Pet. 2.9. Q. Thou beleeuest tru∣ly: for what God hath cou∣pled together, that ought no man to put asunder, 1 Cor. 1.30. But couldest thou not bee content onely to haue sanctificatiō in thy toung, that thou mightest be able freely to talke of re∣ligion? 1 Iohn 3.18. A. No, not so: let it be1 Thes. 5.23. thorowout, or not at all, 2 Cor. 7.1. 1 Cor. 6.20.
Q. Sanctification is a long way to walke in, ma∣ny difficulties accompany∣ing it.Rom. 7. May not the te∣diousnesse of the way cause thee in the end to breake off thy course, and final∣ly to giue it ouer? A. I confesse, I finde in my selfe but too muc weakenesse this way; yet my sure hope is, that he who hath begun a good worke in mee,1 Thes. 5.23, 24. will not now leaue it vnperfect∣ed, Phil. 1.6. Q. Some hauing made a long progresse in professi∣on, haue growne at the length to loath those2 Tim. 4.10.
meanes of saluation, which once they seemed to loue; and so haue separated the meanes from the end. A. But God by his Word and Spirit,Psal 8.4.1, 2.3, 4. hath taught mee otherwise, Psalme 27.4. that is, not to expect for Saluati∣on from Him, as the end; without a constant en∣deuouring to vse all those helpes,Psal. 26.8. 2 Pet. .5. & vers 10. which he hath san∣ctified, to leade me there∣unto. Q. I am glad it hath been my hap, to heare these good things from thee; I wish thee therefore to be of good comfort in the Lord:
for, for ought I yet see, thou art in the way to bee saued. Onely a word or two, con∣cerning thy present con∣dition. How takest thou this thy visitation? A. I take it as sent vn∣to mee, from the hand of a very gracious and louing Father.Heb. 12.5. Q. But commonly cala∣mities in this kinde, are to∣kens of Gods displea∣sure,Lam. 3.39. Leuit. 26.15. A. In themselues they are so, lighting vpon the wicked: but I beleeue they are sent vnto mee in fauour, and for my good. Q. What is the ground
of this thy perswasion? A. Onely theRom. 8.18. word of truth, which assures my conscience through the ho∣ly Ghost that it is so,Reu. 3.19. Heb. 12.5, 6. Q. And yet it may be long,Psal. 13.1, 2. ere God send deliue∣rance. A. Be it so,Psal. 62.1, 5. yet I haue determined, that my soule shall waite on God, in hope and silence, till his appoynted time come: yea, so I may come better out of this affliction, than I went into it, Iob 23.10.Isai. 28.16. I shall not much hasten to bee freed out of it.
Psal. 86.17Q. But if God should shew a token of his goodnesse vpon thee, and presently turne thy sickenesse into health? A. If he should do so, my greatest feare is, lest I should prooue vnthankfull, 2 Chron. 32.25. Q. On the other side, what if this sicknesse should be vnto death, that is, to the separating of the soule from the body? APsal. 23.4 Though I should walk through the valley of the shaddow of death, yet would I feare none euill: See Reuel. 14.13. Q. Doest thou not ap∣prehend
the Graue (into which thou must descend) to be anPs. 49.14 yrkesome and loathsome prison? A. Yes, considered out of Christ:The graue (saith one) shall not grieue me, because it was my Lords bed. Mr. H.S. Pr. but looking vp∣on it through his buriall (whereby he hath perfu∣med it for me) it shall bee much sweeter to me, than a bed of Roses, Isai. 57.1, 2. Q. Thy flesh, it may be, shall lye rotting a long time in the graue? A. And yet, euen there shall my fleshPs. 16. rest in hope. Q. Thy dead bones (see∣ming to be neglected of God, and therefore neglect∣ed
of men) must (as thou knowest) be regardlesly tum∣bled hither and thither,Psal. 141.7. as if they were no better than vnprofitable rubbish? Psa. 139.14 15, 16.A. My God that kept a register of them, before they were, wil much more be carefull of them,Psal. 34.20. Iob 19 26, 27. now they are, so that at the last day, not the smallest shank∣bone, or piece of a shiuer thereof, no not the least pick of dust shall bee wanting, Ezech. 37.7. Q. What thinkest thou shall become of thy dead body in the end? A. My Lord Iesus Christ (who is the resur∣rectionIoh. 11.25.
and the life) will (according to his faith∣full word) raise it vp at the last day, Iohn 6.54. Q. Shall thy dead body then be onely raised vp at the last day.See Mat. 27, 52, 53. Act. 3.21. See Beza Ser. vpon Mat. 27.52, 53. A. No, I verily beleeue, that though this body bee turned into dust, yet it shall be reunited againe to this soule, which now in∣habiteth in it. Q. And shall this be all?Iob 19.27. A Not so: for being thus really vnited by the vnspeakeable power of God,Rom. 8.23. 1 Ioh. 3.2. Col. 3.3, 4. I shal see Christ com∣ming in the clouds for my full redemption out
of all miseries, and woe; and no sooner shall I get a sight of him, but I shall forthwith be changed in a moment,1 Cor. 15.52. and in the twinckling of an eye; af∣ter which, being (with the rest of the Saints) caught vp in the clouds to meete the Lord in the ayre,1 The. 4.17 I shall thenceforth bee euer with the Lord, in whose presence is the fulnesse of ioy,Psal. 16.11. and at whose right hand are pleasures for euermore.
Conclusion. BEe it vnto thee as thou hast said: and seeing we looke for such things as these,1 Ioh. 3.3. the Lord giue thee and mee grace to bee dili∣gent,2 Pet. 3.14. that we may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blamelesse be∣fore him at his com∣ming, Amen, Amen. FINIS.
A SHORT AD∣MONITION touching the heart. Ier. 32.41.WHatsoeuer good thing GOD be∣stowes vpon vs, hee doeth it with his whole soule and heart: therefore, if thou giue any thing to God,Pro. 23.26 giue him thine heart. If thou doe any thing for God, Chn.  21. doe it with all thine heart.
Beleeue in him also with all thy heart.A . Loue him with all thy heart.Gen 10 1. Obey him from thy heart. 17. Feare him with thy heart.Ier 3.40. Seeke him with all thy heart.. 29.13. Turne to him with all thine heart. 2.1. Reioyce in him with thine heart.Zach. 10.7. Pray to him with thy heart.Psalm. 119.145. And praise him with thy heart.Psal. 119.7. If thou lay vp Gods Word in any place,Luke 2.51.
lay it vp in thy heart. Prou. 8.23.If thou bee e∣full keeper of any thing, let it bee of thine heart. Say not but thou hast had warning. FINIS.
