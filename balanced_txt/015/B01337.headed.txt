Of the Eclipses this Year, 1683. THere will be three Eclipses this year, viz. one of the Sun, and two of the Moon. Te first will be an Eclipse of the Sun, and will be visible to us as followeth.   d h ′ ″   The true time of Conjun∣ction at Edinburgh, Janu. 17 2 00 25 aftern. The true time of his visible conjunction, January 17 3 16 00   The digits Eclipsed,   8 13 00   The beginning of this Eclipse at Ed.   01 50 29   The greatest obscuration   03 13 50   The end invisible, beoause the Sun will be set before this Eclipse end. The second will be an Eclipse of the Moon, on the 1. day of Feb. about 3. in the afternoon, invisible to us. The third will be an Eclipse of the Moon on July 28. at 8. in the fore∣oon, invisible to us also. On the 8. of Nvemb. at 1. a clock  year 1683 there will be a conjunction of the Sun, Moon,  and Mercury, which is very remarkable, that at one  the lower Planets should be in conjunction, namely
in the 26. degres of Scorpio. And likewise, the 2. of  there happens a famous conjunction of the two superiour ¦nets Saturn and Jupiter, in that fiery Regal Sign Leo. An besides these remarkable conjunctions, I find the fiery Pla∣net Mars corrupting the Sign of Justice from the 26. of No∣vemb. 1682. until the 12. of July 1683. All these consider∣ed, as also, the Comets which hath appeared, the one de∣scribed by me in the Geographical description for the year 1681. the other appearing first about the middle  August in Leo, and from thence going forward to Virgo, &c. for a∣bout a week in Septemb. having its ray from the Sun as the other, as appears by the opposition of its Ray to the Sun, &c. all these being Signs of great alteration in the world, especi∣ally to those places under the forementioned Planets and Signs, as Ptolomy in his last Centiloquium, and Argol & divers other Astrologers witness, I thought fit not to let them pass. From Aberdene there came these two last years Some Almanacks, or rather Jock the Liers; Whose Author doth no lesse to gain renown, But carpeth still against our ancient Town: Saying we conterfeit his Almanack, Whose value truly is not worth a plack: Because each year his errors doth increase, Whereas be ought each year to make them lesse. He names not those who doth such practice use, But for one's fault a City will abuse: Therefore I blame him who doth Art disgrace, Not knowing where he doth his errors place. The type of his Eclipse each year before Three digits was, I never saw it more, Except this year, he says that we shall see The Sun eclipsed after he set shall be. The Sun doth set ten minuts before four At Aberdene, which is near half an hour Before his Eclipse fall at Aberdene, A Prodigie, the like was never seen! I think bis ten digits he may well call Total, because I'm sure it will not fall At such a time as he to us doth name, Therefore I think he therin may think shame: When as it shall be seen two hours before, I do not erre, although I had said more: When his begins, by right it should near end, Therefore you may by mine his errors mend. More of his errors I yet will to you show, So that the vulgar may it clearly know: The first quarter in August this last year, On Saturnday he did make to appear, Whereas on Tuesday the Change did fall before▪
Making that Quarter four dayes, little more; By which account the Moon comes soon to age, Or else in haste hath run in a great rage. When she beholds such men who think no shame To publish errors in their Countrey's name; Being a Kingdom wherein she hath most might, Vnder the Sign wherein she takes delight. Also he errs again in his Tide Table At Leith, as if the Moon were not so able To rule the Tides here, as at Aberdene: Likewise he errs this year for Hallow-even, Saying it falls upon the Munday night, When Hallowday on Thursday falls by right, Then Hallow-even should on the Wednesday fall, He errs in this, he eras almost in all His Almanacks: hy mine his errors mend, I say no more, I think it time to end.

The foundation of the most usual Metts and Measures in this Kingdom. 1. Metts and Measures are either general to all Kingdoms, Common-wealths, or Re-publiques, or peculiar to one. 2. General Measures most used, are the Line of Chords, and equal parts following. ruler 3. These Lines are used for measuring of Geometrical Figures on Paper, as this following. diagram 4. The Line of Chords F H is used only for measuring of gles, upon the Arch of a Circle, described upon the Angu∣ point as a Center, at the distance of 60 degrees from the e Line of Chords, as the Angle at A in this last Figure measured on the Arch B C, and is equal to 56 degrees the Line of Chords. . The Line of equal parts A I although they be in them∣ves exact half inches, yet they may serve to demonstrate Paper any other measure, in length, breadth, or thick∣e, as whole inches, foots, ells, falls, roods, miles, or
leagues, 3 whereof being equal to 60 degrees on the Line Chords. 6. Measures particular to this Nation (although many of them agree to other Nations also) the most common here u∣sed are these following, being all founded upon Barley and Wheat Corns. 7. The Measures for length, breadth, and thickness, are first Barley Corns, whereof 3 in length make an inch, (but because all Barley Corns are not of equal length, you may take two of the equal parts from the fore-going Line A I, which will b an exact inch alwayes) 12 inches makes a foot; but 8 inch makes a Glazen-wrights foot, 6 common foot is a fathom 37 inches makes the standard ell of Edinburgh, 6 ells make a fall, 320 fall makes a Scottish mile, containing 1184 pace of 5 foot to the pace: The Scots and English league con¦tains 3000 paces, being 3 Italian or Sea miles; 40 falls  length, and one in breadth makes a rood, 4 roods makes a acre of land: But a rood of work wrought by Masons  Sclaters 36 lls in length, and one in breadth. 8. The measures for weighing any thing, are first Wheat take a Corn out of the midst of an Ear of Wheat, is the foun¦dation of a grain weight; 36 grains makes a drop, 16 drop makes an ounee, 16 ounces makes a pound, 16 pound make a stone weight of Lanerk: Apothecaries use scruples weigh¦ing 24 grains, whereof 3 make a dram, being half an ounce. 9. Liquid mets or measures are first founded from the fore said weights, vvhereof 3 pound and 7 ounces of the water  Leith makes a Scottish pint or standard Jugg of Stirling, ea pint containing 2 chopins, and each chopin 2 mutchkin and each mutchkin 4 gills: 2 pints makes a quart, and 4 quart a gallon: Our Scottish gallon contains near 4 gallons and a half English, and so likewise our quart and pint contains times and an half of theirs. 10. Dry measures are first the standard Furlet of Linlit¦gow contains 21 pints and a mutchkin, each furlet contai 4 pecks, by which are measured Wheat, Rye, Beans, Pea and Salt. The furlet for metting Beer, Malt, and Oa contians 31 pints; 4 furlets make a boll, 16 bolls a chalde a peck of Wheat weighs 14 pound 3 ounces, which  168300 grains.
