SJr, this Discourse was brought to me in Latine by some of my good friends, who for that they could not pearce through the harsh and vncouth stile into the meaning of the Author, they prayed me to make the same more transparent by a version thereof into English: which J haue here done in a more explicate man∣ner, and haue aduentured to recommend the same to your patronage, as a pledge of that affection, wherewith J doe much respect you. Only J beseech you, vt facias quod iam facis, that is, that you would aduance that foundation of learning and vertue, which you haue already laid: and that you would endeuour to couple together that rare
society of Estate and worthines, which so seldome concurre in one person: emulating the riches of your fortune, with the riches of your mind: by which meane you shall returne a noble retribution to that house, from which by your Match you haue receiued so much honour. And if you shall please to accept this poore Peece in good part, you shall bind my care hereafter to present you with an argu∣ment, both worthier for the straine, and better su∣ting with your qualitie. Jn the meane time I shall euer studie to doe you seruice, and in your thoughts to deserue the estimation Of your very louing Kinsman ROB. BOOTHE.
A DISCOVRSE FVLL OF DELIGHT, CON∣TAINING THE RELATION OF THE things which in most parts of Europe haue passed worthy the remembrance, since March last. 1614. to this present. WWhen after the lamentable ouer∣throw and death of Bathorie, Gabri∣el Bethline had bin appointed Prince of Transyluania by the Turkes, the Country was diuided into diuers fa∣ctions: some, especially these who were next of blood to Bathorie, be∣ing desirous to reuenge his death, of whom many perished about Medisa, being throwne headlong from the tower, many followed the Emperours parts, taking Husta, and other places in his name, but the greatest part stuck to Bethline, and submitted them∣selues to his obedience. The Turke vnderstanding the state of the countrey, writ his letters to the Nobilitie and Coun∣cell of Transyluania, to this effect; that they could not bee ig∣norant, that from the time that Transyluania liued vnder the gouernment of his ancestors, and himselfe, that the country continued in great peace aed quietnesse vnder their protecti∣on: for that they had sundry times both desired and obtai∣ned aide from his Court against their enemies, especially that Botteskay, when the Transyluanians were but the other day molested by the Germanes, being assisted with his forces, o∣uerthrew the power of the Germanes, and shaked their yoak
from their neckes. After his death, when they saw that Batho∣ra his successor carried things according to his pleasure, and fell from his obedience, that Bethline with the generall con∣sent of the Nobility, complained in that behalfe of him at his Court, and that hee easily obtained meanes to oppresse him, and to free the Prouince from his tyranny. After whose ouer∣throw and death, the wished sunne-shine of peace and liberty began to appeare, after that the clouds of troubles had by his meane been dispersed. And now since the said Bethline hath addressed himselfe to his Court, and submitted himselfe to his order, that he hath iudged him worthy to succeed Bathorius, and to obtaine this Principality; and therefore that hee hath commanded, that all the Nobles of the countrie should sub∣mit themselues vnto him, and obey his commandements, since by this meanes they are like to enioy their wished peace and rest. Furthermore, that ye same Bethline hath by letters aduer∣tised him of certaine attempts of the Germanes, and in that regard knowing assuredly, that this Prouince is setled vnder his protection, that hee had forthwith giuen order to the Commanders of Themsuard, and Agrium, and others, as also to the Prince of Walachia, that they should haue forces in readinesse, and should bee very watchfull at all times to repell all iniuries that should be offered; yea that hee did aduise the Nobles themselues, that they should at all times yeeld all rea∣dy obedience to Bethline, so as they swarue not in the least point from his commandement. And that he sent these letters to this end, that they should take notice of his pleasure, and that they should giue no assistance, to any attempts of the Germanes in this Prouince, whether they be secret or open, but withstand them to their power, vntill the aides of The∣mesuard and Agrium did come, and that in all things they should follow Bethline, esteeming him as their true and law∣full Prince, and continue constantly in his obedience, lest they prouoke his displeasure against them, and procure their owne great misery. Therefore that they should agree toge∣ther, and bee true to their Prince, nor suffer any strangers to shuffle in amongst them, but that they should aduise with Bethline in all matters of importance, and entreate his plea∣sure
for assurance, taking heed that they doe not rashly en∣cline to one side or other. Therefore in as much as they haue continued in obedience to him, that they ought not to doubt of his most mighty patronage, who meant alwaies to pro∣uide that they might liue quietly and peaceably vnder the wings of his clemencie. But if they should fall from their al∣leageance, and shal not be obedient to these his admonitions, that the end will be, that they shall bee forced to melt by his grieuous displeasure, as the wax doth by the fire, and so bee consumed, for that he will neuer endure that any should at his pleasure waste and spoile Transyluania, a Prouince so nearely bordering vpon his kingdome. After the publication of these letters, hee gaue order, that certaine pikes should bee sticked in the ground, before the gates of sundry the principall Noble men and officers cleane through Transyluania, in token that they should die, that fell from Bethline his obedience, to the partie of the Germans, hauing placed in ambush certain companies, about Lippa and Geneum, which places held still for the Empe∣ror, by whom some of the Garrison souldiers, that sallied out to try a fortune, were surprised, and slaine euery man. For which cause, some of them being sent by their commander, came to Vienna to sue for succour. About the same time, a Turkish Embassador came to Lints, with letters from the great Turke to the Emperour; to this effect, that whereas he had concluded a Peace with the Emperour for twentie yeeres, that hee had for his part been very carefull that nothing should be done against it; and that he had giuen strict charge to his officers, whom hee had pla∣ced vpon the frontiers of his territories, that they should giue no offence to the Emperours subiects, and that it was iust and necessarie that the Emperour should doe the like, if he wished that the Peace might continue without violation: but that now he vnderstoode that the Emperour was raising forces especially against Transyluania, which was a Prouince alwaies subiect to his Ancestors and him, hath receiued their Princes designed out of his Court, and being maintained vn∣der his protection from all enemies hath liued in peace in
manner as other Prouinces haue done that be subiect to him. That where hee vnderstoode that Battory did command in that Prouince with tyrannie, hee sent an army lately to de∣presse him, and to free his subiects from his crueltie: and now more, that Battory being defeated, he had designed Gabriel Bethline a Prince of great wisdome and valour, to gouerne the Countrey: and haue ordered that hee should vndertake the same with assurance of his helpe and assistance: but while he by all meanes endeuoured to doe his commande∣ment, that sundry waies this Peace hath been broken on the Emperours part, by the taking of the skonces of Husta and Viuaria, and the townes of Nagipania and Tosnacum. There∣fore that he desires the Emperour, that as himselfe is carefull by all meanes to conserue the Peace, so if he be so affected for his part, that he would giue order to make restitution of the said places to the Prince of Transyluania, or at the least, that he would please by this messenger to let him vnderstand his disposition: who by these letters of his may conceiue how he stands affected to the keeping of the said Peace. That the Peace was not at the first desired by him; but the Emperour was the cause of making the same, which he doth worthily a∣scribe to his owne most iust victories: that now he hath signi∣fied to the Emperor what befitted his greatnes to haue done, and doth desire yt he would forbeare these attempts, & make restitution of the places which he hath seazed vpon: for by so doing, the Peace is like to continue firme But if the Emperor be otherwaies disposed, it shall hereby manifestly appeare to the world, whether of them hath broken promise, and viola∣ted the Peace, and that God will bring to passe, that which he hath decreed. To conclude, that hee desires the Emperour that hee doe not long detaine his messenger with him, but with his letters giue him a speedie dispatch, lest this long ab∣sence of his should breede iealousie in him, that he stand not so carefully affected to the conseruation of the Peace. This Messenger being honourably intertained, was dis∣missed with expedition, with letters wrapped in cloath of golde, to this purpose, that the Emperour hauing with the aduice of the Electors, and Princes, and other Estates of the
Empire resolued touching the busines, was ready to returne an answere by another Messenger, who was already aduaun∣ced on his way to the Turkes Court. Therfore that the Turke should expect but a while, and in the meane time, he should tempt nothing against the Peace. Before this time, there had passed diuers leagues and con∣federacies, betweene the States of the Vnited Prouinces, and certaine of the Hanse townes. Which example the towne of Magdeburge being willing to follow, had determined to en∣ter into a league with them. The which the Elector of Saxo∣nie misliking, writ his letters to the Towne, that hee vnder∣stoode from diuers places, that they determined to enter into a league with forraine states, especially with the states of the Low-Countries: and although he conclude nothing of that businesse, neither doe much busie himselfe to vnderstand the reasons which moued them to do this, yet this he took notice therof for this cause, because he knew not whether they en∣tred into this matter with the priuitie and allowance of the Emperour, for if it were otherwise, they might easilie con∣ceiue how ill the Emperour would take it. And yet, that he by no means could allow this Confederacy so needlesse and euery way vnnecessarie, but seeing he bare no lesse good will to this Common-weale, then his Ancestors had done, and would bee carefull by all meanes, to keepe and defend all harme from the same, that hee thought it necessarie with all speede to disswade them from this league, from which no∣thing could arise, but exceeding displeasure in the minde of the Archbishop of Magdeburge, and many other inconueni∣ences beside. For if they had this purpose in contracting this league, to vndertake any hostilitie against the Archbi∣shop and his Diocesse, by reason of the difference lately growne betweene them, that they may easilie thinke, that both himselfe and other Princes and Electors, will not bee wanting to assist him, as one that is neerely linked to them in alliance. Seeing therefore he knowes very well, that the E∣lectors and Princes will very shortly take paines to com∣pound this difference, that he hopes they will so carrie them∣selues, that the Princes shall haue no cause to complaine of
them, and that the Archbishop will proue himselfe such a one as desires not to presse them with any new burthen, but will condescend that these dissentions and quarrels shall bee de∣termined according to lawe and equitie. Besides these letters sent to the State of Magdeburge, hee wrote other letters to the same purpose vnto the Emperour, that he vnderstood not long since from Christianus Gulielmus Archbishop of Magdeburge, Primate of Germanie, the Mar∣ques of Brandenburge, and others, that the citizens of Mag∣deburge decreed to make a league with the vnited States of the Belgicke Prouinces, and that the foresaid Archbishop hath signified, that the same if it should come to passe, would both be displeasing to him, and would proue heauie and dan∣gerous to his Diocesse, and withall by their ioynt letters to the Emperour, entreated that hee would stop this intended league, and admonish the Senate and Citizens to yeeld obe∣dience and respect to his pleasure. That this message was ve∣ry displeasing to him, and that they could not see, what rea∣son the Magdeburgers had, without the Emperours know∣ledge to affect this league, and to giue occasion to the Arch∣bishop suspiciously to gather matter of feare & iealousie. See∣ing therfore he holds this request of the Archbishop very iust and reasonable, and that in these places it is not fit to giue occasion to draw on new dangers and troubles, but rather maturely to meet with them, especially in this dangerous and hard estate wherein Germany stands, that by all meanes hee doth humbly beseech the Emperour, that he considering the equity of the Archbishops request, would interpose his au∣thority to dehort the Magdeburgers from their purpose, and gratiously to draw them to yeeld obedience to their Archbi∣shop. The Emperour hauing receiued these letters, disswa∣ded the Magdeburgers from this intended confederacy: by which meane, the Citizens also of Brunswicke, who had ioy∣ned with them in this negotiation, returned out of the low Countries without any proceeding at all. In the moneth of Februarie was published an Edict by the Illustrious Iohn Sigismund, Marques and Elector of Branden∣burge, by way of reformation to bee executed in the Chur∣ches
of Brandenburge, directed to the Ecclesiasticall Gouer∣nours of the whole Electorate of Brandenburge, of both sides the Odera, wherby they are cōmanded to forbeare railing and and contentious behauiour; especially in their Sermons. That godly and faithfull Magistrates, haue in all times and places, thought it a part of their duty, to vse al means to stop vnneces∣sary contentions and disputations, who in diuers places do in their publike Sermons bitterly inueigh against other Chur∣ches, as well within as without the Empire, whereof they were neuer appointed iudges, seeing their manner of dispu∣tations, are vndertaken against Christian charity, and auaile more to hinder then to promote the edification of ye Church, that the most renouned Princes & Dukes of Brunswike, and Luneburg, who liued the yeere 1562. Augustus, the Elector of Saxonie, who liued the yeer 1566. Christianus the first Ele∣ctor of Saxony, and Iohn Frederike of Ligsnits; the yeer 1601. who did the same in the name of the Churches of the lower Saxonie, left notable examples hereof, and worthy all imita∣tion, that we need not mentiō higher examples of antiquity. The transaction passed with other Electors and Princes, of whom many yet doe embrace the doctrine of Luther, doth perswade and command, that a course should bee taken, that by a godly moderation vsed in preaching, offences and trou∣bles of consciences may be auoided. Therefore that all men may easily iudge how displeasingly hee hath taken it, and how much hee hath been affected, that hitherto of long time he hath heard, that not of all, but of many in his Electo∣rate, and indeed such, who being moued with ambition rather then zeale of Piety, are likely persons either to do least, if they were brought to a iust triall in argument, or to fall to the Po∣pish partie, if they could make but six pence more, should fill al Churches & Pulpits with their imprecations, criminations, calumnies, cursings and such like outcries, seeking rather glory with men then with God: little regarding whether they speake true or false: and whether it were conuenient or inconuenient to so holy a place, so as they might gall, and bite other Christians, satisfie their humors, spend their cho∣ler, and moue laughter to our common enemies, the Iesuites,
and other Papists, and giue them occasion to slander vs, by this meanes heaping vp the displeasure of God against them and their Auditorie in the day of iudgement. That the holy Scripture doth teach vs farre otherwise: for it doth not war∣rant, that they who agree with vs in the ground of Religion, and stedfastly resolue to be saued by the only grace and mer∣cy of God, for and thorow the merit of our onely Sauiour Ie∣sus Christ, all other meanes quite excluded, who also labour with vs in the vineyard of Christ, and therefore doe suffer in∣numerable persecutions from the common enemies of true Religion, the Pope and his Ministers; nay more, who with great cheerfulnesse and plentie doe euen spend their blood for this Confession, should be excluded out of the Church of Christ. Neither would the holy Scripture, that that which is doubtfull, should bee argued by accusations and slanders, which is proper to Satan, or by coniectures and false allega∣tions, but by the infallible word of God. Therefore that hee doth ordaine and seuerely charge, that all Pastors and Mini∣sters of Churches, doe in the Churches purely and sincerely teach and propound to their Auditors the word of God, out of the Prophelike & Apostolike writings, the foure Symbols receiued in the Church: the Augustane confession reformed, and the Apologie thereof, without all deprauation, and omit∣ting all interpretations, and phrases, and new formes brought in by idle and ambitious Diuines, that they endeauour to gaine soules to Christ, and direct all their labours to aduance the glory of God, and the saluation of men: and on the other side, that they wholly abstaine from criminations, and repre∣hensions of other Churches, which neither are subiect to them, nor conuicted of errour by any lawfull and ordinarie course: not branding them with any name of Hereticke, for that he being vrged in his conscience can no longer winke at these things, but hath determined when hee shall know that any, whosoeuer hee be, doth offend against this com∣mandement, (which cannot bee hid from him long,) that first hee will summon him to appeare at his Court, there first by speech to check his folly, and if he can doe good with admonitions, either to remoue him from his place, or chastise
him with some punishment: and courses besides shall bee taken for obstinate fellowes, who vpon summons doe not appeare at our Court, whereby they may easily bee brought to obedience. But if there be any who being carried with an intemperate zeale, suppose by this meanes that a curbe is laide vpon their consciences, that hee will not bee against it, but that they may giue ouer their Ministery, and with leaue depart out of his Electoratship, and go to those places where they may bee suffered to rage; and to wound Christians, to curse and execrate, expecting at the last from God a iust re∣warde of their intemperate fury. Lastly, that he doubts not, but that as this Edict hath been published by him, by the prescript of the word of God, to keepe the Peace, tranquilitie and concord in the Churches of those countries, which by God are committed to him, in these last and dangerous times, wherein the Antichrist of Rome seemeth more then euer before to thirst after Christi∣an blood, all and euery one, in regarde of the commandement of God, whereby subiects are by the Apostle commanded to bee obedient to their Magistrates, that they will conforme themselues to obedience, and take care not to prouoke his displeasure against them, lest they bee forced to trie to their losse and griefe, that they beare not the sword in vaine: the heads of the Articles, according to which this reformation was to be practised in the Churches, were said to be these. That images should be banished out of the Churches: the Altars that were made in time of Poperie, to be demolished, and long tables of wood to bee set in their places, couered with a blacke carpet, and a white cloath vpon it, when the Supper is to bee administred: That the statues, images and crosses, drawing their beginning from Poperie, are to be re∣moued out of the Churches. That their holy Palles are no more to be vsed. Candles not to be lighted. Auricular Con∣fession to be laide aside. Prayers in the Pulpit to bee deliue∣red not submissely, but with a loud voyce. That in time of danger, especially in the time of Plague, the Supper of the Lord is not to be giuen to the sicke. The Decalogue and Ca∣techisme to be better reformed. That the blessed Trinitie is
to be represented by no images, either grauen or painted; the words of the holy Supper to be vnderstoode and expounded, in the true and right sense: with some other Articles as it was reported. Some yeeres past, and before the Peace made with the confederate States of Holland, a Seafaring man of Holland, had been taken by the Masters of the Spanish Inquisition, and had been condemned to the fire for a Psalme booke one∣ly which was found in his custodie, but by some strange de∣uice hee escaped that danger; but afterward returning into the same place againe, as being secure from feare, by reason of the League, hee was againe taken by the Inquisitors: and notwithstanding the intercession of the States to the Arch∣duke, who writ to the King in the prisoners behalfe, hee was condemned and burnt aliue. His kinsfolkes haue made many complaints to the States for this crueltie, and to reuenge the same, haue intreated ear∣nestly, that they may haue leaue to saile into the West Indies. About the beginning of Aprill was an honourable mee∣ting of the Electors and Princes at Naumburge in Thuring, the Elector of Saxony with his brother Augustus, the Elector Brandenburge, and many other Princes, to conclude and ad∣uise of the hereditarie league betweene the noble families of Saxony, Brandenburge, and Hassia, of the precedencie of the houses of Vinaria and Alkenburge, and of the doubtfull and controuersed busines touching Gulicke and Iuliers. In the meane time, ielousies and vnkindnes euery day in∣creasing betweene the Princes of Brandenburge and New∣burge, many of the Electors and Princes laboured to bring them to accorde. But the States of Cleueland assembling to∣gether, agreed to incline to neither side of the foresaid Prin∣ces, nor to allow any contribution to them, vntill they were assured of their true successor and Master, and at once sending their letters to the Archduke Albert, to the Elector of Col∣len, & to the Estates of the vnited Prouinces of Belgium, re∣quested them that they would haue no hand in this busines, but that they would leaue it to be determined betweene the Princes themselues: to whom the Elector of Collen answe∣red,
that for the great desire he had of peace, hee would be ve∣ry vnwilling that any warre should arise, especially in the Em∣pire, and Countries neighbouring vpon him; and yet if the Prince of Newburge should haue any wrong done him in his right pretence, that by no meanes he might forsake him, and sending to Dusseldorpe Reckius his Embassadour, exhorted the Princes who were seased of some places, to lessen their traine. And although they fell to the number of twentie fiue attendants, yet the Brandenburgian presently changing his purpose, after that the Newburgians, laying aside their armes which they carried closely; that is, Pistols, and other wea∣pons, which might bee tied vnder their cloakes; and walking onely with their swords by their sides, answered, that he also would willingly condescend to all reason and equity, espe∣cially in the determining of the question of succession be∣tweene them: and forthwith departing to Gocha, within the Principality of Cleue, hee sent his Embassadours to the Estates of the vnited Prouinces, who by all meanes exhorted both the Princes to auoide trouble, and to conserue peace. But when the Estates vnderstood that the King of Spaine had commanded his souldiers to be in a readinesse, they also gaue order to haue Waggons prouided, that if necessity re∣quired they might carrie their souldiers thither, where the Spanish forces should bend. Which prouision gaue the Arch∣duke occasion to write to them, to this effect. That he lately was aduertised by the Estates and Councellors of the Duke∣dome of Cleue, of differences growing betweene the Illu∣strious Princes, George William of Brandenburge, and Wol∣fangus William of Newburge, and of the dangers which ther∣by hang ouer the whole Countrey, with a request also from them, that to his power he would for the conseruation of the common peace, meet with these difficulties. Therefore that he being moued with the request of them of Cleue, and al∣so for that it imported him very much, that his neighbours should liue in peace, had by his letters aduised the Princes, that as louers of peace they would entertaine loue and con∣cord, and with all diligence auoide troubles, adding withall a protestation, that hee in regard of the peace and right hee
hath to maintaine ouer those places, that he of necessity must bee an enemy to him, who is the first author to moue any stirre. And although hee doubt not but that they are of the same mind with him, and will not suffer that any dore should bee open to so great dangers and troubles, yet that hee was willing to desire them, that if they thought good, themselues would bestow some paines to conserue the publike peace, which wil very soone be violated and disturbed in these parts, if these Princes should fall together by the eares. There was offered to the Emperour about the beginning of Aprill, the declaration of Wolfangus William Prince of Newburge, his submission in the Mulheme businesse. But the Elector of Brandenburge would in no sort submit the busi∣nesse to be desided by the Emperours Councell of Court, but endeuoured by all meanes that it might bee remitted to the Imperiall Chamber; in which behalfe he wrote to the Empe∣rour to this effect. In that he had not to this time returned an answere to the Emperours letters, touching a new hearing of the busines of Iuliers, that he did it not of purpose, nor of any intent to delay the matter, but for waighty considerations which hindred him. But that indeed there are many rea∣sons which hinder that hee may not condescend to yeeld to this treatie of the businesse: for that it is euident by the relation of the Count Hoelsoller, sent from Erford to the Emperour the last yeere, how deceitfully he was dealt with∣all, who hauing nothing but hony vpon their tongue, did by all meanes studie to besmeare his face. And since this hap∣pened by the foresaid Earle, who professeth himselfe a kins∣man of his house, and is by oth obliged to him, for his here∣ditarie Office of the Chamber, which hee holds of him, that he may easily imagine how farre hee is to trust others in this cause, who are not in that place of relation to him. And sure∣ly that his feare and iealousie is not a little encreased by that same dangerous and most pernicious decree in the businesse of Mulheme, which a few daies ago Iohn Ludouike of Vlmes, bearing the Chancellors person in the Emperours Court, pro∣cured to bee intimated to him, although in the whole yeere nothing was done to his knowledge in that cause in the
Court, not so much as by way of ordinary talke. Whereby it may easily appeare what affection the Emperours officers car∣rie towards him. Although therefore he hath good reason to looke to himselfe, being admonished by these former steps, nor to commit any thing that may concerne him to such kind of men▪ notwithstanding passing by all these things, to shew his care to yeeld to the Emperour his due respect, that hee submits his cause to this treaty, with this condition, if first he may vnderstand, whether and how these other competi∣tors doe submit themselues. Secondly, if it proceed not fur∣ther then is fit to proceed in a friendly hearing, and that hee may be at no preiudice, if they cannot agree, or any decree be made that is hurtfull to him: but that all things bee left in the same state they were before the treatie, vntill this busi∣nesse be determined in a lawfull manner. Furthermore, since he hath taken the possession of the Principality of Iuliers in a manner lawfull, and by all law to bee allowed, (considering what the Archduke Leopald, and the Bishop of Passauium haue done) and that the Emperour himselfe hath passed his promise, which he hath reason to beleeue, to maintaine euery one in his possession, nor to remoue him from it, but by a law∣full decision of the businesse going before, that it is a need∣lesse thing to trouble the treaty with the point of the posses∣sion, which is onely to be directed to the point of chalenge for the right: otherwise if they doe, that hee will admit no treaty at all, seeing also vnlesse he be admitted in the partici∣pation of the Fee: yet without preiudice to others, hee may easily perceiue that for the point of the challenge hee should bee neglected, that hee doth beseech the Emperour that hee would also conferre vpon him this Fee, as hath been done to others, and so make him equall to the rest; and that he hopes, that the Emperour will chuse into this businesse Arbitrators honest and swayed with no preiudice, nor enclining to either side, but indifferent and equally affected to them both. Lastly, since he is not ignorant, that certain haue gone about to per∣swade the late Emperour, that he hath some interest as Lord Paramount ouer these countries, & that this dirictum Domi∣nium, so called, and the prerogatiue of the Emperour annexed
to it, may not bee called into question: that he desires of the Emperour, that hee may vnderstand what hee may expect from him in this point, and that with conuenient speed. Ther∣fore when he hath receiued answere to all these things, and that the certaine time, when this hearing shall begin, bee set downe by the Emperour, that hee will take care that no want bee found in him. Other matters hee would haue referred to this future hearing, but that hee beseecheth the Emperour not to bee offended with him, but that he would preserue his right to him, no lesse then to others. That he could haue re∣ceiued this answere, and his exception to the time that this Treatie begins, but to saue time and expence, and that the Emperour may see the sinceritie of his mind, which he brings to the handling of this busines: that hee was willing afore∣hand to open his mind to the Emperour, before any entrance into the matter, to whom hee professeth himselfe most ready to doe all seruice. About the end of Aprill was taken a Pirats ship, which car∣ried in her aboue 60. brasse peeces, and was very rich beside, which lay in waite vpon the coast of Ireland, for foure Hol∣land shippes, which a little after came out of Ginnie very richly laden with gold and spice: shee was carried to Amster∣dam. There came at the same time into Holland, Embassadours from Muscouia, whom the Estates caused to be brought with a great traine from Leiden to the Hage, the 11. of May, be∣ing admitted into the Councell house, they declared in a long speech, that their great Duke, did by all meanes desire the friendship of the Estates, and desired them that they would furnish him with money and shipping against his enemies: being there willed to exhibit in writing this their request, they did so. But when it did not appeare, what profit might returne to the States out of Muscouie, they fearing lest they might offend the King of Poland, after deliberation, made them this answere conceiued in writing, whereby they might assure the great Duke of Musco of their friendly minds, and great good will towards him, and so dismissed them with roi∣all intertainement, and great gifts. Count Maurice presen∣ting
to them a gallant shew of a battell, according to the true manner of Military discipline, which they beheld with great admiration. Suigelius the Master of the horse, hauing assaied Dussel∣dorpe, Cleue, and other places, when all his secret practises would not preuaile, at the last was receiued into Gulick by the Gouernour Pythamius, with whom hee had secretly plotted the same before, bringing into the towne diuers companies of the Estates souldiers. For when Pythamius did see that the Castle of Gulicke was in great danger, by reason of the vnkindnesses, which euery day grew more and more among the posseding Princes and their friends, the Brandenburgian and Newburgian garrisons, being ready to fall to blowes, he thought it the fittest way to draw in these companies of the Estates. The Captaines of the garrison souldiers, as wel Bran∣denburgians as Newburgians, being ignorant of any pra∣ctise, forth with tooke armes: but being perswaded by the said Gouernor, and Suigelius, Hancrote, Bonnus, and other Com∣manders of those forces, that it was for the good of both the Princes, the Bandenburgians were pacified: but the Newbur∣gians giuing no credit to them, made sharpe resistance, till af∣ter some blowes, and slaughter of diuers, they came to agree∣ment, and were contented. Which done, Hancrote and Bon∣nus hauing commission for that businesse from Graue Mau∣rice, continued in the Castle with their forces, and haue since strengthened the fame with 7. companies of horse and foote, drawne out of the Vnited Prouinces, making besides great prouision of victuall and other necessaries to keepe the place. Which when the Prince of Newburge vnderstood, he ar∣rested certaine Officers and Councellers of the Prince of Brandenburg, remaining at that time at Dusseldorpe: and dis∣patching Messengers to diuers places, exhorted the Officers of Cities and Gouernours of Castles, that, as mindfull of the oath they had taken, they would keep diligent watch in their townes, and vse all circumspection against such manner of traines and practises. But for the defence of the Citie, hee thought good to let in the souldiers; which when the Burgers did earnestly withstand, he inuited all the chiefe Senators to a
banquet, in which time certaine Musqueteirs, slipping out at the Posterne gate, made themselues masters of the towne watch, and let in the Country souldiers, who the next day were bestowed at the Gates, their number increasing euery day, and bulwarkes and forts raised against the gates. In the meane time, the souldiers of the Estates assaulted the Mona∣stery of Scheiuenhem, and they of Brandenburge the Mona∣stery of Siburge, but both in vaine. But when the Archduke heard of the newes of the surprising of the Castle of Gulicke: forthwith hee mustered his souldiers, and made preparation for this iournie; the Vnited Estates also doing the like, which bred such a feare among the Countrie people of Iuliers, that they took al their goods, and carried them to Vtright, Leids, Collen and other places. There was mention made in our former bookes of the af∣faires of Aken, and for them wee are now come to the Com∣mination of the proscription. Therefore the Elector of Hei∣delberge writing his letters to the King of France, desired him that he would in time interpose his authoritie: who with∣out delay dispatched his letters to the Elector of Collen, to dehort him from the execution of the sentence: that the de∣cree of the Emperor against the city of Aken, to strike it with the thunderbolt of Proscription, for those things which there fell out in the time of the vacancy, in the name of his kinsman the Palatine Administrator, and vnder the title of his Vicariat in the Empire, was very displeasing to him; therefore waigh∣ing the danger, which by the execution of this sentence see∣meth to threaten the Peace of Germany, which it concerneth neerely, that this citie should be preserued, that hee as a Chri∣stian Prince, whose part it is, by all meanes to maintaine the publike Peace among the Confederate Princes of the king∣dome, that hee could not forbeare to put him in mind of the mischieuous and dangerous issue; which peraduenture this execution may haue, therefore that he desires, that he would please to take notice from Praeaustie his Embassadour, resi∣ding in Flanders, of those things, which he hath giuen him in charge, especially on the behalfe of his kinsman the Palatine Elector.
These letters were sent to the Kings Embassadour Moun∣sier de Preux, with other letters besides to him to this purpose. That he hath sent to him the copies of those letters, which he had receiued from the Elector Palatine, in the matter of the Aken-busines, which passed during the vacancie, and when the Vicariate of the Empire fell to him, that by them vnder∣standing what he challengeth to belong to him, touching the execution of the Proscription decreed against this citie, and committed to the Archduke Albert, and Elector of Collen, and of the right, which the Palatine Elector in this cause pre∣tends to belong to him, hee may obserue and discerne how much the Palatine doth promise to himselfe for the conserua∣tion of the peace in Germany by the interseding of his autho∣ritie with these Commissioners. Seeing therefore there han∣geth no small danger ouer whole Germany by this execution, especially if the Princes ioyning together, shall earnestly op∣pose themselues against it, that he hath sent him letters, writ∣ten to the Elector of Collen, & chargeth him to deliuer them to him, and that he would propound to his consideration the waight of the whole businesse, as also the declaration of the right which he hath, in hindring this endeuour of his against the Palatine Elector, and the dangerous accidents tending to the mischiefe not onely of the citie of Aken, but also of the whole Empire, together with the demimution of the authori∣tie and honour of the Emperour: and that hee write backe withall speed to aduertise him how farre hee hath preuailed with him. In the former bookes, we spake of the broiles which were raised in France, with a commemoration of the grieuances exhibited to the Queene by certaine principall personages, and the answere to the same. And seeing it concerned the Common-wealth very much, that the seedes of troubles should bee choaked in the very bud, and the sparkles of fire quenched in the very kindling, before they bee able to take flame, Lewes the most Christian King, when he vnderstood that a meeting was appointed by the Princes at Soissons, the 7. of April, incontinently sent certaine of his Councellors thi∣ther, who should giue remedy to their grieuances, and friend∣ly compose all differences, furnished with letters of credence
to this effect; that as before he had sent them to Soisson, that they might treat with the Prince of Condie, and others there assembled, so at this time especially He, the Queene Mother, and the rest of the Counsellors and Princes consenting, doth will, and giue them full power, that looke what conditions they shall thinke honest and indifferent, for the mature com∣posing of their troubles, they should accept, and assure in his name, that they shall be faithfully obserued in Court, and that they do all things, which hee himselfe would doe, if hee were there present. And if so be that this Treatie shall require any more speciall commission, that hee doth promise in the faith and word of a King, that whatsoeuer shall in this businesse be done, transacted, concluded, decreed, and promised, that hee will hold it, ratum & gratum: that is, it should bee as strong, and as well pleasing to him, as if he had done it himselfe, and that he will by speciall edicts giue commandement, that it be executed, and this power shall euery one haue, although they shall be hindred either through sicknesse, or any busines, that they could not bee there. This Treatie failed not of his wish∣ed profit: for they agreed vpon certaine articles of Peace, which were afterward ratified at San-Manehold, to wit, that vpon the summons of a generall Parliament, all the States of the kingdome should assemble at Sene, the 25. of August: and there it should bee lawfull for the deputies of the three Or∣ders, to propound those things, which in their conscience they shall find to be profitable for the good of the Common∣weale, and ease of the subiects, that so the King vpon aduice with his kinsfolke and other Princes, may in conuenient ma∣ner, publish wholsome constitutions, renue ancient decrees, and annull and abrogate Orders made to the destruction of the subiect. That the marriages vndertaken with the Spani∣ard, should remaine in their full force, seeing the Queene Mother hath by her letters, giuen sufficient reason for them to the Prince of Condie, that the bulwarkes of the Castle of Messeron, should be throwne downe, and that the request of the Duke of Niuerne should bee satisfied, touching a certaine summe of money, which hee demands of the King, for buil∣ding of a house in liew of that, which he had at Massera, which was throwne downe, when the castle was builded.
That the Castle of Blauet, which in the time of these troubles was seased, and began to bee fortified, should bee razed to the ground, and the place to be left in the same state as it was before the troubles, the Captaine and guard remoued out of it; which Order must be conceiued generally to extend to the rest of the castles and forts, which were euery where raised in the Prouince, during the troubles. That for auoyding and dis∣charging the charges and inconueniences, which the subiects endured by the souldiers, as well French as strangers, which were hitherto leuied, & diuerfly scattered in the kingdome, in the name of the King and Prince of Condie, from the Kalends of Ianuary, al souldiers on both sides should be dismissed, and the strangers should within twelue dayes from the ratificati∣on of these Articles bee conueyed out of the kingdome by Commissioners deputed by the King and Prince, and the French souldiers should within the said time, withdraw themselues to their owne houses, vnder the paine appoin∣ted for vagabonds and rogues. That the Prince of Condie by the Kings permission, shall keepe the towne and castle of Am∣boyse, with 100. garrison souldiers for his securitie, vntill the time of the general Parliament. That the Duke of Vendosme, if he returne to his house, and rest contented with these Arti∣cles, should be restored to his place, and enioy his former ho∣nour as before, all manner of inhibitions being taken away and abolished by the publike Edicts, that they may preiudice nor hurt him any more. That hee receiued money of the chiefe of the Prouince to maintaine his armie, the King should allow. Likewise for one whole yeere complete, the King should maintaine the forces appointed for Machen, and Bell Isle, if the Captaine of Retse shall require the same. That the damage, which was done to Monsieur de Camore at Hen∣nebon, where he is Commander, should be recompensed, and he restored to his former office and dignitie. That all compa∣nies of souldiers brought into the cities and townes of this Kingdome, during this commotion from the Kalends of Ia∣nuarie vntill this time, should be dissolued, except 100. soul∣diers at Massire, and 200. at Soisson, vnder the command of the Duke de Maine, which are to continue vntill the Parlia∣ment
be finished, seeing that other Cities and Townes should be restored to their former estate. That the King by his letters sent to all the Parliament, should signifie and make knowne that he is sufficiently perswaded, that the Prince of Condee and other officers of the kingdome, of what estate and condi∣tion soeuer, who followed them in this commotion, attemp∣ted nothing of any euill purpose, neither did fall from their obedience due to the King, adding a necessary both excuse, and assurance, that they need not be called into question for them, but that they should bee againe restored to their for∣mer Dignities and Offices, and enioy the profits of them as before: And that letters should be dispatched to the confede∣rate Princes and Estates, and that they should truly vnder∣stand with all speed by certaine fit Messengers for that pur∣pose, what the King doth assuredly know touching the in∣nocency and loyall affection of the Prince of Condee and o∣ther officers. That the King shall pay to the Prince of Con∣dee for the charges of him and other officers during these troubles, the summe of foure hundred and fiftie thousand pounds to bee diuided by him among the Princes and other Officers. These matters thus being ordered, and allowed and confirmed by the King, the Prince of Condee, and other Princes and Officers of the kingdome disclaimed and re∣nounced all confederacies vndertaken either within the kingdome, or without, and promised neuer to enter into any league any more. On the other side, the King granted to the Duke of Niuerne his letters Patents, to him and his eldest sonne of the gouernment of Champaine. These businesses in this manner being passed, and all a∣greement signed and sealed by the King himselfe, the Queene Mother being President, and also by the Prince of Condee, and Ventadurius, the Duke of Bullion, and other Princes, the Prince of Condie wrote his letters to the Queene Mother, wherein he professed that both in regard of her great good will before time declared vnto him, and also for the great fa∣uour shee had done him in this present treaty, that hee ac∣knowledged himselfe so much obliged to her, that hee could not forbeare to giue her great thankes for this royall affecti∣on
of hers towards him: but hee did beseech her that shee would waigh courteously and equally with her selfe by what freenes of mind hee was impelled to vndertake these busines∣ses, who if he might haue liued without the malice of aduer∣saries that lay in waite to surprise his honour and estate, had neuer proceeded so far, neither had any stir beene made in the kingdome. But now all matters being stilled and quieted by the grace of God, and the wisdome of the Queene, that he did earnestly beseech her that shee would so order and go∣uerne all things hereafter, that no occasion may bee offered to the renewing of the like Commotions; for that hee for his part would alwaies be most ready in his place to performe all manner of seruice to the King his master. While these things passed in France, there appeared at Prage, and thorow all Bohemia a Sunne Circle called Paralia, and two Sunnes seemed to appeare in heauen. At Nemeth in Hungarie, a fountaine neare to the walles of the City brake forth with great force into streames of blood, almost by the space of an houre. At Butoarium a woman brought forth a monster, resembling a Seafish. And another womā in a village not aboue a mile from Prage, brought forth a child with one body, but fearefully shaped, with foure hands, and foure feet, which liued vntill the next day. A little before in Carinthia it rained a kind of red graine, whereof there was baked good bread, which was brought ouer by certaine Merchants from Villacum. And euen at this time was seene in the aire a red Crosse, not without great wonder and terrour to the behol∣ders. Almost about the same time, being the fifteenth of May, Wol∣fangus William neglecting the Augustane Confession, fell to the Pope, and embraced the Romane Religion, and at a Masse, which was celebrated in the parish Church of Dusseldorpe, with great solemnity and all manner of musicke, hee with his wife receiued the Sacrament after the Popish manner. After∣wards a Sermon was made by the Deane of the Church, out of the third Chapter of Iohn, wherein also the reasons were deliuered, for which the Prince had withdrawne himselfe into the bosome of the Romane-Catholicke Church. After
a few daies a Nuncio came from the Pope, accompanied with certaine Capuchine Monkes, to Dusseldorpe, to conferre ple∣narie absolution and benediction vpon the Prince, and to ex∣hort him to constancy. This reuolt and change of Wolfangus bred great sorrow and griefe in the mind of Philip Ludouicke Prince of New∣burge the father, and since that which was done could not be vndone, being sollicitors in the behalfe of his subiects, ex∣horted them to fall to prayer for the conseruing of the sincere and wholesome doctrine of the Gospell, and to that end pub∣lished an Edict to be obserued by all the Pastors of the Chur∣ches to this effect. For as much as he hath ordained and com∣manded all the Pastors and Ministers which is in the Princi∣pality of Newburge, that they carefully prouiding against this present necessity, and the eminent fearefull change of Re∣ligion, that not only they themselues doe meete in the Chur∣ches euery Monday at twelue of the clocke, to powre forth prayers to God with their hearers, but also that they be care∣full that the same be done by the Ministers and Preachers vn∣der their Iurisdiction, that he doth straightly command and enioyne them all that they giue good example to their hea∣rers, and that they the time and place aforesaid, and together with their Auditors, men, women, and children, and their whole families, they doe beseech the Lord to turne away the danger, which now is at hand, and that in the solemnizing of publike prayers, they doe premise a generall admoninion in this manner. Besides the calamities and manifold punishments, where∣with the Lord hath chastised these Countries for their ma∣nifold transgressions, that now it is greatly to bee feared, lest they be depriued of the greatest treasure which they haue in this world; that is, the puritie of the word of God, and that the famine which the Prophet speakes of doe fall vpon these Countries. That they all had deserued this punishment tho∣row their vnthankfulnesse, security, & contempt of the word of God, yet is to be hoped, that if turning to God with their whole hearts, they shall repeate and implore the goodnesse of God, and doe present their supplications to him against
the dismission of the sincere Preachers of the word of God▪ and the change of religion, which wil in time proue hurtful to them and their posteritie: it may come to passe, that God for the merit and intercession of his sonne, and for the glory of his most holy name, may repent him of his purpose, and may leaue his blessing amongst them, that they may yet longer en∣ioy the great Supper of his, to which they haue been inuited. Therfore to this end that God is to be inuocated with ardent prayers, and true groues, in this manner. O etérnall God, &c. But when this vnexpected change of Prince Wolfangus Guilielmus, bred diuers thoughts in the minds not only of the Courtiers and Councellors, but also of the commons of those countries, who professed the Augustane and reformed religi∣on: the Prince to pacifie them and to hold them within the compasse of their obedience, published an Edict, wherein he declared, that he had no intention to make any disturbance a∣mong his subiects in the point of religion: that he did not on∣ly heare by relation, but obserued it himselfe: that many of his Officers, Councellors and other Ministers, as also of his subiects dwelling in cities & villages, are much troubled and perplexed in regard of his Christian conuersion, and publike confession, and this his transition to the ancient Roman Church, as if by reason of the euident and knowne difference of religions, he meant not to maintaine them in the exercise of the religion, but in the point of religion would make innoua∣tion, and force them to embrace the confession of a contrary religion. Therefore that no occasion may be taken of alte∣ration, and of change of allegeance and dutie due vnto him, especially in these touchy and dangerous times. And for as much hee neuer intended any such thing, that hee thought good by these letters to testifie, that he hath resolued not only to depart from the couenants and mutual obligations passed, but also with all his power to withstand them, who shall de∣part from the same, and to direct all his actions to the glory of God, the safetie of his countrie, and to the preseruation of iu∣stice, which is equally to bee administred to all, without any respect of religion. And that he hopeth well, that all and eue∣ry of his Councellors, Officers, Commanders and subiects, wil
constantly continue in their due obedience. For they who shall doe the contrary, and fall away from their dutie and al∣leagance, shall no longer enioy their commodities and priui∣ledges, which either they receiued of their ancestors, or haue obtained by couenant and mutuall obligation. These letters being published the 14. of Iune, when it was giuen out that the Prince of Brandenburge went about to bring in the refor∣med religion, he also by his Proclamation professed, that eue∣ry man shall enioy his religion, and that none vnder his go∣uernment shall suffer any trouble for his conscience sake. Now for the extinguishing of the vnkindnesse growne be∣tweene the Princes of Brandenburge and Newburg, and to compose all controuersie in a friendly manner, there was a meeting appointed the 10. of Iune, at Wesel, whether the E∣lector of Collen and the vnited Estates sent their Embassa∣dors. Who when they perswaded the Newburgians, that they should within three daies dismisse their souldiers at Dussel∣dorpe, both the garison souldiers and the mustered also, and that they should forbeare to fortifie the towne. The New∣burgians wondring at this their Order, answered, that if Gu∣lick were restored into her former estate, that they would bee readie to doe what lay in them: but rather then they would yeeld consent to the diuision of the countrie, they would first trie all manner of extremitie. Therefore when neither part would yeeld from their right, that meeting was frustra∣ted. The Newburgians returning home, when the Prince vn∣derstood the demands of the vnited Estates, to shew himselfe inclinable for his part, conceiued in writing certaine Articles, by which hee supposed a composition might be made, and caused it to be presented to the Estates: That the whole trea∣tie at Wesel consisted in this, that the Vnited Estates did hold, that the army mustered by the Duke of Newburge should be dismissed: on the contrary, in the behalfe of the Prince, it was declared not onely for what reasons that army was leuied, but also how necessarie it was, that the army should be with∣drawne from Gulick, and that towne to be reduced to his for∣mer estate. Therefore when as the Estates themselues haue
by their letters declared, that they gaue warrant to their Commissioners, to compose by way of prouision at the least al controuersies betweene the Princes, and to prouide, that as well their subiects as neighbours, should be preserued from al danger and trouble. Notwithstanding that ielousies and di∣strust haue not a little growne by this, that against his priuitie and consent, and otherwise then he had deserued of them, he was dispossessed of the Castle of Gulicke, and his garrison souldiers put out of it, which possession and detention hath been hitherto continued, vnder a pretence of a common be∣nefit to both the Princes: whereby it is no hard matter to con∣ceiue, what suspitions are like to arise thereby in the Empire, especially with the Emperour himselfe, who is chiefe Lord of the Fee, and other Electors and Princes, pretending any title to those countries, that he should be so disturbed, in a possessi∣on purchased with such danger, charge and trauell, and the sequestration before time so much misliked by the Estates of the low Countries, and with many reasons oppugned against the Arch-duke Leopalde, should there so easily be allowed. Seeing therefore there is danger, lest those that loue not the Prince should draw this innouation into suspition, and make that construction, that it should be thought, that more respect was giuen to the Estates of the Vnited Prouinces, then to the Emperour himselfe, (whom the Prince doth acknowledge the chiefe Magistrate, and Lord of the Fee) but also would of∣fend the Emperour, and prouoke him to enter into a new Pro∣cesse against the posseding Princes, and so would draw into danger a possession hitherto, procured with great trauell and charge, to the great preiudice of the Prince, the which not∣withstanding the Prince is loth to conceiue of the Estates v∣nited, since by many letters they haue abundantly declared their good affection toward him, therefore that the Prince doubteth not, but that the Commissioners deputed by the E∣lectors and Estates vnited, to compound this businesse, con∣sidering these reasons, wil do their best endeuour, that restitu∣tion maybe made of the castle of Gulick, and of all the appur∣tenances thereto. For first of all, that the Prince of Newburg will not refuse, (if the Prince of Brandenburge will doe the
same) at the first before any restitution made, to bind himselfe by his hand and seale, and to promise in the word of a Prince, that he will attempt nothing against the Prince of Branden∣burg either now or hereafter, but in all points will keepe the conditions agreed vpon, and will be a faithful and equall kee∣per of the castle of Gulicke, as also of the castles, townes, skonces, and cities of these countries, without any mans pre∣iudice, for the behoofe and vse of him who shall be the lawful successor and possessor, that hee will deliuer them to no third person, whosoeuer hee bee, that hee will not vsurpe no more power ouer them, then the Prince of Brandenburge, but will gouerne and moderate all matters as before in an indifferent course of friendship, euen vntil the controuersie be finally de∣cided. But to take away the difficultie which may happen, about the placing of an indifferent Gouernour in the castle, that the Prince of Newburge shall be well contented, that by the full consent of the Princes, or of the Estates of the country, a certaine number of the Noble men of the countrie, fit for such a businesse should be deputed, and from that time after, that the Gouernours, Commanders, Lieutenants, and other officers, bee chosen by lot, such as may yeeld to each Prince their due obedience, and may afterwards submit themselues to him, to whom the succession shal be adiudged: in the meane time that they do their seruice to both the Princes, and to the whole countrie, and be maintained by them: taking diligent heed, that no forrein souldiers come in amongst them, or that their forces be increased without the priuitie of the Princes, a a law certaine also to be made, which should be obserued in admitting either of the posseding Electors and Princes. Ther∣fore whatsoeuer either of the foresaid Princes shall recipro∣cally promise one to the other, that the Deputies of the Prin∣ces Electors, and of the Vnited Prouinces, should not onely subscribe and confirme with their seales, but should promise to procure, that the same shall be allowed and receiued of the subiects of their Principality, the letters of ratification and al∣lowance, being sent to each partie mutually, within the next moneth after the transaction and agreement concluded. Fur∣thermore, that the Emperours consent also, as the Lord Para∣ramount
is to be entreated, and the Kings of France and Bri∣tanny to be requested, not onely by the Archbishop of Col∣len, and the estates of the vnited Prouinces, but also of both the Princes, besides the neighbour Electors and Princes, that they would hold this transaction firme and stable, and would defend each part, and maintaine against all vniust force. That the Counsellors of each part bee admonished, that they rest vpon this transaction, and attempt nothing against it. Be∣sides a Parliament to bee summoned, and that both the Prin∣ces should earnestly endeuour that the Estates of the Coun∣trey be bound, to the cōseruing of this transactiō in euery re∣spect, and to impugne and withstand by all means that partie that shall violate the same. When as therefore by this meanes not only the vnited Estates, but also all others may be assured that the Castle of Gulicke, (in the recouery whereof as they, so also the Kings of France and Brittany, the vnited Electors and Princes, yea euen the posseding Princes themselues haue been at great charge,) shall neuer come into the possession of any third person, and the Prince of Newburge openly testifie, that during this treaty his meaning is to vse the souldiers ly∣ing at Dusseldorpe onely for the security of himselfe and of the place, and so soone as the transaction is finished will dis∣misse them, and enter into accord with the Prince of Bran∣denburge, that in himselfe hee may receiue some place for these most equall conditions, that he would beseech and ad∣monish the deputies, that thus sundry grieuances and com∣plaints taken away, there may be a reconciliation of the par∣ties procured, a course may with all speed bee taken for the speedy determination of the controuersie, and that in the meane time all things may bee administred with an indiffe∣rent hand, according to the tenour of the former couenants. But if the Commissioners either all or some of them, haue not warrant to condescend to these most equal cōditions, but shall thinke it necessary that this treaty should bee adiourned for two or three weekes, vntill they may consult with their principals (by whom they are sent) and know their mindes, and that afterwards the same shall againe bee renued, perad∣uenture also with the assistance of both the Kings, (who are
not to be left out in this businesse) that the Prince will not be against it, so as they vndertake that no matter of hostility shall be attempted on either side. And that he doth hope that the Commissioners will vse that care in the debating of the businesse, that they may with the more facility arriue to their intended end, that is, to the restitution of their ancient confidence, and the conseruation of peace and tranquillity. The King of Spaine when he vnderstood what was done touching the Castle of Gulicke, moued the Archduke Al∣bert to assist the Prince of Newburge, and to that end gaue order for the leuying of forces, and for money, which he sent into the Low Countries. Therfore Albert calling backe the Captaines and other Officers, whom hee had before sent a∣way, and declared the Marques Spinola, Generall of the army, to execute vpon the Cities of Aken and Mulheme the sen∣tence of proscription, which the Emperour had made against them, who leuied diuers Companies of horse and foot, and prouisions of al kinds for the warre, which was carried to the Maze. On the other side, the Estates of Holland laded three ships with artillerie, and drew to Schenke Skonce great for∣ces, that is, 70. Companies of foot, and 18. troopes of horse, besides 1500. Waggons for carriage of their prouisions. In the meane time the Prince of Newburge tooke diuers places in the Dition of Bercke, as Machem, Mandaue, Ellers∣field, and Burgh, which he also fortified with men and muni∣tion, and bearing himselfe as lawfull successor, intending a∣lone to interre the body of the dead Prince, without the pri∣uity of the Prince of Brandenburge, who had withdrawne al his forces and stuffe from Dusseldorpe to Cleue: but hee was deterred from that purpose by the perswasion of the Estates vnited. Some few yeeres a goe, there was set forth a booke at Col∣len, with this title: Franciscus Suares of Granada, of the so∣ciety of Iesu, Doctor of Diuinity, his defence of the Catho∣like and Apostolike faith, against the errours of the English sect. This booke being examined in the Parliament of Paris, and found to containe in many places diuers propositions and doctrines, contrary to lawfull Kings appointed by God,
and to their regall power and authority, and against the peace and tranquillity of their kingdomes, it was vpon mature de∣liberation decreed and sentenced, that those doctrines and positions so scandalous, seditious, and inuented and publi∣shed to the subuersion of kingdomes and countries, and to arme their subiects against their Soueraigne Kings and Prin∣ces, yea and also detected to be manifestly ful of lies and blas∣phemies, euen in those places where the examples of Clodoe∣us and Philip Pulcher are alleaged, are therefore worthie to be burnt by the common hangman in the outward Court of the Castle. This done, it was by proclamation forbidden, that no Printer should print that Booke, or being printed should bring it into the kingdom, reade it, write out, or keep it, much lesse that any should reade it in schooles, or giue vp the pro∣positions contained in it to be disputed. And a Decree further was made, that the Decree of Theologicall faculty, made by vertue of a Parliament order, published in the yeere 1610. of renuing the censure of doctrines made, anno 1408. in the Councell of Constance, and also in the yeers 1578. and 1595. together with this late decree of Parliament, should publike∣ly reade euery yeere the fourth of Iune, in the Colledges of the Theologicall faculty, and also of the Priests and students of Claremount Colledge, and of the begging Orders, and that at the sute of the Kings Atturney General a diligent pro∣cesse should be made against thē, who had written any thing against this Prohibition. Furthermore it was decreed, that the Fathers of the society of Iesus, Ignatius Armundus, Rector of Paris, Cotton, Frontone, and Sirmund should forthwith ap∣peare in Parliament, and there that they should receiue re∣buke and taxation, in that against their owne promise and de∣cree made by their Generall, anno 1610. the foresaid booke was printed, and was brought into the City of Paris, to an∣nihilate the authority of the King, to the dishonouring of his person, and to the disturbance of the peace of the whole king∣dome, adding this charge to them besides, that they should conferre with their Generall about the renuing of this De∣cree, and publishing the same with all speed, and within the space of six moneths next ensuing, should publish and declare
openly that thy haue obeyed and satisfied this commande∣ment of the Parliament, and haue by their letters prouided, that no such bookes hereafter shall bee written by any of this society, and published abrode. Besides the Iesuites were en∣ioyned, that in their sermons they should disswade and deter the people from the liking of such kind of propositions, and hereafter should teach and preach the contrary, if they did o∣therwise, they should bee pronounced and declared by the Parliament guilty of high Treason. All these things were done and published the 27. of Iune, in the Pallace of the Parliament, in the presence of Ignasius Armundus, Carolus Tourus who appeared for Cotton, Frontonius Duke, and Iames Sirmundus, fathers, who were specially required to be present at this businesse. In the former booke we spake of Sigefride Collonitius, how by an arrest made on him he was staied at Neostade, who not long after was by night carried to Vienna, and laid in the prison, wherein wee mentioned that Guntherode had been kept before time. Comming to Vienna, by chance he spied a certaine Embassadour of Dresda, whom he entreated to pro∣cure him the fauour of the Elector of Saxony, who afterward did entreat in his behalfe to the Emperour in this manner. That Rodulph the late Emperour did many times vse his ser∣uice to excellent purposes against the Turkes, who therefore held him in great account, as indeed hee was for his vertue a wonder to all men, and a terrour to his enemies. Therefore that he besought the Emperour, that in regard of his vertue and worth, and the fame of his name, hee would deale grati∣ously with him, and restore him to his liberty, especially since now he hath made his innocency manifest to the world. By which act, he shall not only bind the loue of Collonitius and all worthy souldiers to himselfe, but shall take away from o∣thers all occasion of sinister conceit, that this which he suffers is for his religion and conscience. In like manner the Count of Thuron entreated the Emperour in his behalfe, alleaging that it was not only permitted, but also commanded by God that one should sue for another; and therefore that hee trusting to the Emperours singular grace and clemency could
not forbeare, but at the earnest request of Collonitius, to inter∣pose his prayer and intreatie in his behalfe. For he had been in former times his fellow-souldier, in the warre against the Turkes, wherein he carried himselfe faithfully and resolutely, and by his famous exploits in that seruice, and valiant deeds hath purchased a name, that in those parts will neuer bee for∣gotten. Now if vpon any weakenesse or ouersight hee hath committed any fault, he doth beseech his Maiestie, that in re∣gard of the faithfull seruices, which he hath done to the house of Austria, he would please to pardon it, as proceeding not of mallice, and that out of his grace and goodnesse, hee would discharge him of the arrest, and suffer him to answer freely for himselfe. To this time the Turkes with their incursions and depopu∣lations into the countries adioyning, did the Christians much mischiefe. And hauing driuen a great multitude of cattell, were at last encountred in the way by the Heyduccians, in number about 800. who in a skirmish put the Turkes to flight, halfe a mile from Agria, and recouered the bootie out of their hands. The Bashaw of Agria vnderstanding this de∣feate, drawing foorth 1000. of his garrison souldiers, renued the fight, but was so receiued by the said Heyduccians, that he was beaten, hauing lost 200. souldiers, and his horse slaine vnder him, that he had much a doe to escape. The Heyduccians encouraged with this successe, marched further, and on the sudden assaulting a castle vpon Solnocke, tooke it, and carried away great store of goods and cattell. O∣thers skowring the countrie towards Buda, by chance light vpon a Lady going to be married from Strigonium to Buda, whom they chased, & brought away a great deale of wealth, which they tooke from the company. Not long after hauing battered the castles of Balastera, Micoluta and Fellaco, they o∣uerthrew 500. Turkes and more, and sacked and spoiled all those places about, and when the Turkes asked, why they so vniustly brake the Peace, they answered, that they gaue the occasion, by the depopulations and excursions which they de, but they for their parts were good fellowes, that nei∣er cared for the Roman, nor the Turkish Emperour.
Some few yeeres passed, there arose certaine contentions betweene the Citizens and Senate of Frankford, about the publication of priuiledges, which had been decreed and pro∣mised them by the Emperour: for the appeasing and reconci∣ling of which differēces, were deputed Commissioners by the Emperour, Iohn Schuichardus, Elector of Mentz, and Lewes, the Lantgraue of Hassia: who, after long and painefull exa∣mination of the businesse, brought the matter to that passe, that they accorded vpon certaine articles, of which we will onely mention the chiefest. First, that the Senate should faithfully deliuer, and open all the priuiledges of the citie, 7. persons being selected for the executing of the businesse, an oath being first taken of them, in whole custodie the Records are kept, that nothing shall be carried out of the Office, and next of the persons selected, or deputed, for the reuiew of the priuiledges, that if they find a∣ny which may be preiudiciall to the citie, they shall conceale them: and other, if they shall seeme profitable for the citizens, that they shall faithfully reueale and discouer them to the Commons. Many other articles were agreed vpon, which rather con∣cerned priuate commoditie, then the publick administration of the commō weale. But the differences between the citizens and the Senat were composed, and that the Peace and friend∣ship might the better be preserued betweene them hereafter, and that both obedience and respect might be yeelded to the Senate, and the Citizens without impeach enioy their liber∣ties and priuiledges, there was decreed solemnly a publike re∣lease and obiteration of all those things, which during these troubles haue been done or said vrgently betweene them: that none of those things should be preiudiciall to any. Fur∣thermore, that they should forbeare all secret conuenticles and factions, and especially that none, either Senator or Citi∣zen should vndertake or attempt any thing against this trans∣action: the which since, the Emperor at the earnest request of the foresaid Commissioners, the Senat and the Citizens hath ratified, and confirmed by his speciall rescript. The Companies of Smolensco, who returned home
of the warre of Mosco, did with great importunity chalenge their pay, and made great vprores in Polonia and the Coun∣tries thereabout, killing of the Countrie men, with no lesse cruelty and furie then if they had been in the enemies Countrey, spoiling and burning all where they came. There∣fore the Elector of Brandenburge, to remoue such a mis∣chiefe from the borders of his Countrey, put his subiects into armes, and sent to the Bishop of Halles many waggons laden with prouisions for warre. The Elector of Saxonie following his example, mustered vp his souldiers also, and taking great quantities of armes out of his storehouses of Dresda, and Wi∣temberge and his other armories, caused them to bee carried to diuers Castles and Townes. When the rumor was spread of the Gouernour of Mil∣laine, the Dukes of Mantua, Sauoy, and Lorraine, and o∣thers, that they had a mighty armie in readinesse, the vnited Electors and Princes, were from diuers places admonished, that they should take circumspect heed of a sudden irruption; in the meane time the Moscouites making a sudden incursi∣on into Lithuania, infested and annoyed all the Countrey a∣bout with burning and spoyling. The Tartars in like manner wasting and making hauocke in the confines of Polonia. The 12. of August died the illustrious Prince, Philip Ludo∣uicke the old Duke of Newburge, who by his last Testa∣ment made the Duke of Wittemberge, and the Marquesse of Durlace his Executors. At this time the Prouinciall Diet was held at Lints, wherein all the hereditarie Prouinces of the Emperour, the Bohemians, Austriacks, Styrians, Carinthians, Carnio∣lanes, Silesians, Lusatians, Morauians and Hungarians were assembled. It was propounded in that assembly, that of the Turkes part the peace was broken, by reason of many excur∣sions, and direptions of men and cattell, and other hostile at∣tempts of that kind, and that so much more certainely, that besides Valachia and Moldauia, hee hath made challenge to Transyluania as his proper inheritance, and hath fortified it with Garrison souldiers, vnder the gouernment of Gabriel Bethline, hath assembled the States of the Countrey, and hath
denounced by his letters to the Emperour, that he should for∣beare to intermeddle in the Countrie. There was mention made of Gabriel Bethline, that he hath made him Gouernour, and the Turkes Vassall, that this Prouince might be vnited to the Turkes Empire; since then it brings more hurt then pro∣fit to the Christian world, it seemeth no part of wisedome to abandon the Countrey to the Turkes, especially considering the benefit which it bringeth to the Turke, and the mis∣chiefe it bringeth to the Christians, seeing it is so opportune for each party to make warre against the other. That it is no expecting the ratification of the peace, seeing the Sultan will by no meanes suffer that the Prouince should sweare to them both. Furthermore, it was in the Parliament demanded, since things hold no longer currant, but the Sultan laies claime to the Prouince, nor will suffer that hereafter the Germanes should giue lawes to the Transyluanians, what should be an∣swered to the Turke touching all these things: and since the Turkish Embassadour hath come without any commission against the expresse conditions of peace, & the Sultan hath no wil to ratifie the sixth Article of the transaction, if his Embas∣sadour is to be admitted, and his letters to be receiued by the Emperour, to whom onely it is fit they should bee deliuered. The last question was this, whether a new transaction bee to bee made with the Sultan, since hee refused to ratifie the for∣mer, and whether the Sultan stand to his promises or not (as hee hath done about Moldauia, Valachia, and Transyluania) if hee should inuade Hungary before this Parliament bee finished, what is to bee done, should the Emperour descend to a meane of pasification, which by him hath not hitherto been violated? In the meane time came the Turkes Embassadour to Lints, by sea. Therefore those Delegates which were there present, in the behalfe of the hereditarie Prouinces and kingdomes, without delay deliuered to the Emperour their answeres to al the propounded articles of the present consultation: whose opinion was, that it behoued the Hungars to deuise a meane how this transaction made with the Sultan might be kept on foot, and yet without preiudice to the Emperours authority,
and in regard of the future and imminent necessity, that ne∣cessary meanes might bee prouided for the defence of the Countrie. The Transyluanians by all meanes labouring, and deprecating, that no army may set foot within their Pro∣uince. During this Parliament the Mandate Declaratorie of the proscription in the businesse of Aken, was published in Frank∣ford the 23. of August, by the Subdelegates of the Empe∣rour, to this effect. That after his happy accesse to the Em∣pire, hee vsed all speciall diligence immediately, that in all places iustice might bee restored to her brightnesse; and by this as by a meane the peace and concord of all estates and members of the Empire might be conserued. Therefore after that hee vnderstood in the very entrance to the Empire, of the troubles and confusions which fell out from the yeere 1611. in his and the imperiall city of Aken, as well in ciuill as Ecclesiasticall matters, that he tooke especiall care and notice of this businesse, and vnderstood all which was at large ope∣ned by both the sides, as wel in the behalfe of the old Catho∣like Senate, as of them who now are in place of authority, first at Vienna, and next at Ratisbone: moreouer that he might vnderstand the whole truth, sent from his Court to this City honorable Commissioners the next yeere 1613. that by this meanes hee might bee the surer not to swarue from iustice in the future decision of the businesse: and how hee hath with mature deliberation examined, whatsoeuer hath been writ∣ten to him in this case by the Electors, Princes, and the Estates Imperiall, of both Religions, and hath omitted no meanes which might in any sort make for the true knowledge of this businesse. And that it is euident by all the Acts and Records made in the course of iustice, that when in the yeere 1582. the first stirre began in this City, whereby the Senate was re∣moued from his authority, and a great change made as well in Ecclesiasticall as in ciuill matters, his brother Rodulphus Caesar, out of his fatherly affection to this City, thought it to belong to his duty, maturely to prouide by what meanes this fire might be put out: for euen for this cause that he appointed the next neighbouring Princes to this City, and
Estates of the Empire, as the Bishop of Leige, the Duke of Iuliers and Cleue, Philip Buron of Vimeberge, and Philip Earle of Nassaw, the Commissioners, who were very carefull and diligent to compose this busines, but could not preuaile with these troublesome spirits, who neglecting the whole authoritie of the Emperour, and the Commissioners, tooke vp armes in all fury, seazed themselues on the publike armorie, and on the Senate; that the Emperour when hee vnderstood this, yet proceeded not to extremitie of law, as yet, but euen vsed all gentlenesse, and gaue a second Commission to the E∣lectors Iohn of Triers, and Augustus of Saxony; but for all that, could preuaile no more then before, further then that their Subdelegates, who setting a part the danger of these troubles, aduentured themselues into the citie, after much losse of time and paines, they left a plea of Recesse there, which each part might vse to the finall determination of the cause, in the Diet to be kept at Augusta, anno 1582. That they did not onely accept of this Recesse, but also deliuered their complaints to Rodulphus Caesar, and spent many yeeres in pur∣suing the businesse before him, vntill at last anno 1593. be∣ing summoned to heare the definitiue sentence they appea∣red, for there in the presence of the Emperour, and with his allowance, the sentence was published against the defendants in this manner: That those things which had been done in the citie, in a furious and vnlawfull maner, should be accoun∣ted as void, and that all things ought to be restored into the same state, wherein they were before the innouation. But whereas the other side which quailed in the iudgement, did not as yet satisfie the excecutorie decree of the Emperour, it fell so out, that in the yeere 1598. that is, the fiftie after the condemnation, and publication of the definitiue sentence, the sentence of proscriptiō was pronounced against them, for this insolent and stubborne contumacie of theirs. By this course, being at the last brought to submission, and when vpon their othes they promised that they would in euery point obey the Emperors commandement, they were againe by the Em∣peror receiued into fauor. But afterward in the 13. yere after, when not only against the executory sentence published, and
the declaration of the proscription made, but also against the sworne submission of the condemned persons, who notwith∣standing for the most part were not natiue citizens, but stran∣gers, and forreiners comming from other places. That the Em∣peror Rodulphus tooke that behauiour of theirs in very il part, as a thing exceeding contrary and preiudiciall to his authori∣tie and dignitie, in regard of the sentence passed, and the mat∣ter iudged already, and forthwith to iustifie and make good his authoritie published against this tumultuous & sedicious company, a very seuere penall decree, with this meaning, that they should giue ouer these attempts, and at the last obey the sentence pronounced ann. 1523. by which meane they should discharge their owne promises. And although he bee gone to heauen, yet there is no doubt, but if he had liued longer, he would neuer haue endured this iniurie done to his imperiall authoritie and dignitie, especially seeing he had in his life ap∣pointed Ernest Arch-bishop of Collen, and Albert the Arch∣duke his brother his Commissioners, for the pacifying that tumult, and executing his decree, with most absolute power to execute the same. But for as much as he being dead, in the time of the vacancie, and during the tumult, a plea of Recesse hath been made and published in the citie, the 19. of May, anno 1612. by the Delegates of the Illustrious Prince Palatine, Iohn Administrator of the Palatine Electorate, and Vicar of the Empire, which doth directly crosse this former execu∣torie decree, and the promises confirmed by oath, and ten∣deth not only to the mischiefe and hinderance of them, who now had won the right, which they sued for, but also to the empairing of the authoritie of his brother deceased, and of o∣ther succeeding Emperours, that a businesse already now iud∣ged and sentenced, and submissions confirmed by oath, should without any iudicial course, be so easily blowne away, that he after diligent examination of all circumstances, and delibera∣tion vsed touching the whole businesse, cannot otherwise iudge and pronounce, but that the sentence of the Emperour published the 27, August anno 1593. and the submissions and promises which ensued the same, should abide in full force, and that the commandement of the Emperour, published last
of Octob. an. 1611. ought in all points to bee satisfied, with∣out any consideration to be had of the foresaid recesse or in∣parlance. Therfore that he hath appointed the most Excellent Ferdinand Archbish. of Collen, and Albert the Archduke his brother his Commissioners, in no other manner then before was done by the Emperour Rodulph his brother deceased, and hath giuen them power, that either themselues, or they by their substitutes, should signifie this his Mandate Declara∣torie, to all the inhabitants of the imperiall towne and royall seate Aken, and according to the full power, wherewith they are furnished, should by all meanes compell the parties con∣demned to due submission and obedience, vntill they doe re∣store all things to the same state, wherein they stood, before the 6. of Iuly, anno 1611. Therefore that hee doth earnestlie charge and command, al and seueral the citizens, inhabitants, and subiects of the foresaid citie, whosoeuer haue vnder any pretence attempted any thing against matters iudged, execu∣tions, obedience, and the commandement of the Emperour, published, ann. 1611. that forthwith they forbeare all these in∣nouations and stirres, vnder what colour or title soeuer, that they restore all things into the same place wherein they were, after the submission made anno 1598. vntill the 5. of Iuly, anno 1611. that they do in deed and truth, testifie their submission before the Commissioners or their Substitutes: that they o∣bey and doe all things which the Commissioners in his name command them, and attempt nothing against them, so as they will auoid his certaine displeasure, and the punishments, included in the former executions, and in the last Mandate of the Emperour, the taxation of the charges, and the speciall punishment and censure against them who haue professed themselues the ring-leaders and authors of those troubles, be∣ing reserued to his peculier order; as also on the other side, he promiseth that he will administer iustice to all, hearing all complaints, which any shall make against the old and lawfull magistrate, after the submission made. This Mandate Declara∣tory, dated the 20. of Feb. at Budouitium, when it came to Al∣bertus the Archd. hands, the executiō therof was by him com∣mitted to the Marques Spinola, who incontinently mustring
vp 30000. horse and foote about the Thine, departed to Maes∣striht, with 400. waggons, and 80. peeces of great ordinance, and from thence marched to Aken, bearing on his Tent the Eagle, the ensigne of the Empire. When he was come before the towne 21. August, and with great speed had pitched his campe, and placed his ordinance, the next day he sent his mes∣sengers into the citie, to acquaint the Senate and Townes∣men with his commission, and the Emperours commande∣ment, who presently assembling the Companies, entred into deliberation, how to giue speedy remedy to these mischiefes, that the citie might be spared. Therefore after diuers consul∣tations, the conclusion was, that the Clergy with the Popes Nuncio, with other principal Burgers, should goe to Spinola, and humbly intreate of him fauor in the behalfe of the towne and the inhabitants. Which when they had done, after a very little conference, the city was yeelded to the Emperours plea∣sure. The towne being giuen vp, the souldiers of the Prince of Brandenburge were dismissed out of the towne, with their armes and colours displaid, the 24. of August, and twelue en∣signes of horse and foote brought into the towne: vpon whose entrie, the gates were shut, that none might passe any way. After this, the new Senate of the Protestants being dis∣missed, the other Popish Senate, which had been discharged, was restored to his former place, and from that 28. day, was had the first meeting in the Senate to begin publike consulta∣tions: and certaine souldiers, by whose helpe, one of the Consuls had escaped ouer the walles out of the towne, and some others, who were reckoned the chiefe authors of these troubles, were committed to prison. The 15. of September last, were two great Armadaes in a readines, the one of the Turkes, to the number of 65. Gallies, which lay at Nauarine in Morea, which was the old Pelopo∣nesus in Greece: another of the Christians, who haue 85. Gal∣lies well appointed at Messina in Sicilie, who had then taken two of the Turkes Gallies spies. It is suspected the Turke in∣tends this preparation for Calabria, the countrie is likewise prepared to bid him welcome. The matter thus ordered at Aken, Spinola with his armie
marched toward Duren, whom the townes-men met in the way, and deliuered him the keyes, as to the Emperours Lieu∣tenant. In this time the Prince of Newburge leuied his for∣ces, which consisted of 800. horse, and 5000. foote, and the Count of Ridberge was employed to leuie more souldiers. On the other side the Prince of Brandenburge gaue order to his Captaines and Officers to leuie three Companies of foot, and 1000. horse. Also the Palatine Elector vsed great dili∣gence in leuying of forces, which hee drew to Bilifield to the appointed place vpon the marches of his Countrey, com∣manding his subiects that they should be ready if occasion of seruice should require. Spinola after that he had left souldiers in Duren, marched to Mulheme, which he tooke, and leauing 500. men to throw downe and to raze the trenches and bulwarkes of that place, departed and tooke in Berchem, Castre, Greuenbruke, and o∣ther small townes, and put souldiers to keep them. Afterward going to Rhinbirke, he made a bridge of boates ouer the Rhine, that he might passe his armie for Wesell, Rese, and Emmericke. This vnexpected iourney of Spinola, and successe especially at a time when there was now begun a friendly treaty, the Embassadors of the Kings of Britanie and France being present, and interceding for peace, gaue occasion to the Estates of the vnited Prouinces to suspect ill dealing: which caused them with all celerity and speed to gather their forces and to hasten into the field. The Emperours Mandate being published at Franckfort, as we haue related before, that none should be so hardy as to hinder the ancient Senate, but that they may enioy their for∣mer place, when the time of submission was now at hand, the Substitutes of the Elector of Mentz, and Prince of Darme∣stadte, came into the City the 11. and 12. of August, and shewing their letters of warrant, carefully aduised the Citi∣zens to obedience. The Citizens a little before this time had sent certaine messengers to Lints, who exhibiting complaints against the old Senate to Caesar, should entreat that this abro∣gation of their authority might be ratified by the Emperour. But because they were not as yet returned, a writing was de∣liuered
to the Substitutes, and a request made by the Citizens that the execution of this Mandate might be respited but vn∣till the returne of those Citizens, adding this protestation, that if it so fell out that the Emperour continued in the same mind still, that they would not be against it, but in all points would obey his pleasure. In the meane time some of the old Senators had taken their place againe, and now the time ap∣pointed in the Mandate for submission was at hand. Therfore they sent for the seruants of sundry tradesmen, the 22. of Au∣gust, opened vnto them the meaning of the Mandate, and to auoide the danger and mischiefe that might be fall them ther∣by, aduised them by all meanes, that they would not sticke to their masters and Lords, but depart some whither out of the City for a time. Then there went a rumor abroad, yt they who were noted to be disobedient, should shortly see their names fastened to the gallowes. This report whether it proceeded from the Substitutes, which they haue constantly denied, but the other affirmed, or whether it was deuised by some other, which is more probable, certainely it was the cause of a great vprore in the City. For the common people transported with rage and fury, did in flockes runne vp and downe the towne, and began to encourage and prouoke one another to commit some notable outrage, vntill toward euening, the whole force of their madnesse being conuerted into the Iewes street, they spoiled and ransacked the same. The Iewes at the first with∣stood them, and with barrecadoes of all manner of stuffe de∣fended their houses, being assisted by some of the Citizens themselues. But the numbers of the raging multitude encrea∣sing more and more, and the rascals and loose people flocking out of all quarters and corners of the towne, and mixing themselues with the seruants and prentises gathered such a head, that they were past resistance, the Consuls themselues and other good Citizens being vnable to preuaile against their furie, either by force or by perswasion, for the rage the more encreased, the more it fell out that any were wounded in the tumult. For one was wounded in the arme, another in the eare, another in the eye: some being wounded to death fell to the ground. The next day the Citizens armed them∣selues,
and came vp with a competent number of horse and foote into the street, and taking the goods from those loose fellowes, whom they could light on in the streets, caused them to be laid vp for the owners. So there was an end made of this robbing and mutiny. The Iewes moued with the feare of this vprore, to the number of 1500. forsooke the City, resoluing to dwell somewhere else. Marquesse Spinola in the meane time comming to Rhin∣berke, resolued to besiege Wesell, accompanied with 12000. horse and foote. The Vesalians vnderstanding this determi∣nation of Spinola, presently dispatched messengers to Rhin∣berke, to gratulate his comming, and to present him with cer∣taine cartlodes of wine, and to desire of him the cause of his comming, that they might giue him satisfaction; who an∣swered them, that they must restore the City into the same condition and state of gouernment wherein it stood in the time of Charles the fifth, and receiue his Garrison into the towne. When this answere was deliuered to the Citizens as∣sembled in the Parish Church, they bound thēselues instant∣ly by mutual othes, that they would fight to the last gaspe for their Countrey, and die and liue together in the quarrell. But Spinola the 23. of August approching with all his Camp nee∣rer to the towne, sent certaine Companies aforehand to make an assault vpon the walles: which the townes-men issuing out of the towne receiued in such manner, that they slew very many of them, especially with the great Ordinance, which played from the towne: but Spinola marching neere with the the rest of the armie, they retired into the towne: But he cau∣sed 18. Murall engins to be set against one place of the wall, threw downe one of the gates of the towne, which with the fall oppressed diuers, and stroke such a terrour into the minds of the Citizens, that the women in all places came with their children running to the walles, and with weeping and wringing of hands entreated Spinola to spare them. A treaty hereupon appointed, an agreement was made, that one thousand souldiers should bee receiued into the City, and should be billeted by the Magistrate vpon diuers houses, who notwithstanding liuing vnder military Discipline, should bee
no burthen to the townes-men, nor receiue either meate or money of them. 2. That Gulicke being once restored to the former estate, by the Estates of the Vnited Prouinces, the City should be againe discharged of these Companies of soul∣diers. 3. That no change should be made either in ciuil mat∣ters, or Ecclesiasticall, and those which concerne religion. 4. That the City should retaine all her priuiledges without impeachment. 5. That by this occasion no preiudice should be offered to the Prince of Brandenburge. 6. That his Offi∣cers and Ministers with all their armes and prouisions might remaine in the City so long as please them. 7. That the City should keepe still their Ordinances and all Prouision for war in their possession. 8. That the Garrison souldiers of the City should depart with al their armes. 9. That it should bee free for any Citizen to depart out of the City, whensoeuer hee would. These conditions being subscribed by Spinola, and after to be confirmed by the Prince of Newburge, the City was deli∣uered into Spinola his hands. While these matters passed in this manner, Graue Mau∣rice, Count of Nassau, drew out his forces to the number of eighteene thousand horse and foot, appointing his rende∣uous at Schencke Sconce, and taking to him William Henry Fredericke, and Iohn Ernest, Count Chastilion also, and Sir Ho∣race Vere, and many other braue Commanders, marching with his whole armie by water and land, hee came before E∣mericke, and suddenly surprised the towne, and put a guard in it. Next he marched to Rese. Now the townes-men a little be∣fore had sent their Consul to Spinola, promising him that they would receiue a guard from him. But whē his Excellency had pitched his Campe, and summoned the towne to yeeld them∣selues, they refused, & discharged their Ordinance against the Spaniards, which Spinola sent with their consent, professing that they would bee neutrall, and would receiue no guard from one side or other. The Spaniards being thus sent away and deluded, his Excellency commanded that the Artillary, and all prouision should bee made ready to batter the towne which he intended to do very strongly: but the Burgers when
they saw there was no remedy, yeelded the towne, and receiued a guard from his Excellency: who from thence marching further, tooke in Gocha, Calcar, Gunep, and other townes situate in those quarters. In the meane time Spinola neglecting the conditions of the treaty made with them of Wesell, encreased his guard against his promise and faith giuen: for he brought in three thousand souldiers to the great hurt of the City, and so terri∣fied the Burgers, as he had done before at Duisburge, that not one Preacher durst dare to preach in publike, in so much as their Churches seemed to be desolate. But further making a bridge of boates ouer the Rhine, betweene Wesell and Bu∣ricke, part of his armie he sent to take Sante, part he employ∣ed to raise a bulwarke vpon the Rhine anenst Wesel, by that meanes to keepe both the passage of the Riuer, and the City it selfe in his power. There had been carried from the siege of Gulicke into the towne of Wesell, 22. peeces of great Ordi∣nance, with exceeding store of powder and shot. All which hee permitted to bee taken away, and to bee restored to the Prince of Brandenburge. But his Excellency marching on still, drew so neere to Spi∣nola, that he ioyned Tents with Spinolaes Tents, in so much as the Prdues and Sentinels might not onely talke, but also eate and drinke together. And when hee desired to see the letters of his commission, that he might know in whose name he entred into this expedition, Spinola desired his Excellency that hee would in like sort satisfie him, who caused so many Trumpeters to sound the trumpet, as he had noble personages in his Campe. But to the declaration of the Estates of the vnited Prouin∣ces, that they would deliuer the Castle of Gulicke by way of sequestration to the two Embassadors of the Kings of Britan∣ny and France, the Elector of Cullen answered: That he knew not the minds of both the Princes, whether they will assent to this motion or no: and that hee knew as little whether these Embassadours haue sufficient warrant from the Kings their Masters to doe the same: that as hee conceiued, it was a busi∣nesse rather of priuate honour, then the good of the Coun∣trey
which was stood vpon. That it cannot be denied, but that hee loseth nothing of his honour, who restores that which is not his owne; therefore it should bee fit for the common good, that on both sides restitution should bee made of all places, and all questions which haue risen from hence, should bee clearely taken away. After hee exhorted his Excellency, that he would please to spare neither time nor paines to com∣pose these differences, but that hee would bee willing to stay armes, that the matter may be drawne to a treaty. That hee also hath dealt earnestly with Spinola, that would stay here, but that he would not hearken to the motion, vnlesse he were assured that the Estates, and the Marquesse of Brandenburge would also sit still, and attend the issue of a treaty. Therefore that the matter might with more conueniency be brought to a treaty, that hee would wish his Excellency and the Estates to be effectually dealt withall. We spake somewhat before of the preparations of the Go∣uernour of Millaine, and other Princes of Italy to armes. Now about the beginning of September, the armies of the Gouer∣nour of Millain, and of the Duke of Sauoy, which are repor∣ted to exceed the number of 40000. haue met in the field, and fought a very bloody battell. Albeit they of Berne and Gene∣ua, and others, suspecting that some trechery lyeth hidden vnder this pretence of quarrell, are vpon their guard, and pro∣uide circumspectly against the worst: being also aduised dili∣gently by the Protestant Princes and Estates, that they suffer not themselues to be abused by any false pretences. Therefore certaine Imperiall Cities, as Strawsburge, Norimberge Col∣len, Wormes▪ Ratisbone, Bibracke, Memming, Vinshem, Rotenburge, Veissenburge, Offenburge, Noerdling, Hail∣brun, Essing, Reutling, Suinfurt, Colmar, Halle in Sueueland, and others, haue with great speed sent their Embassadors, for a meeting to be held the 6. of Septemb. in this cause of Vlme, by reason of these tumultuous businesses, and rumours of warres, the illustrious Princes of Wttemberge and Anhalte ioyning with them in this busines. FINIS.
