THE DECLARATION OF HIS EXCELLENCIE JAMES Marquis of Montrosse, Earle of Kilcairn, Lord Greme, Baron of Mont-Dieu, Liev∣tenant Governour of Scotland, and Captaine Generall of all His Ma∣jesties Forces by Sea or Land, for that Kingdome. LONDON; Printed for Matthew Simmons, next doore to the Golden Lyon, in Aldersgate Streete. 1649.
THE DECLARATION OF HIS EXCELLENCIE JAMES Marquis of Montrosse, Earl of Kincairn, Lord Greme, Baron of Mont-Dieu, Lievtenant Governour of Scotland, and Captaine Generall of all His Majesties Forces by Sea or Land for that Kingdome. HOwever the Justice of His Majesties cause, the wicked∣nesse of those Rebells, and my own Integrity, are all of them so cleare and evident, that to doe any thing which in the least measure may seeme to descend to a dispute, or to hold such enemies as a considerable partie, may rather be interpreted as an act both of publicke injustice to his sacred Majestie, and private injurie to my selfe, then of Dutie, or Equitie: Yet the further to confirme the world in a truth so generally known, and acknow∣ledged, the more to encourage those who will Engage with mee, and the more powerfully to disabuse those, who have hitherto unwillingly been involved, and out of their simplicitie inveigled in those desperate courses▪ I doe in the name of his most sacred Majestie, and by vertue of the po, and authoritie by Him graunted to me DECLARE. THat howbeit there hath been (and still is) a most Horrid, and Infamous faction of Rebells, in the Kingdome of Scotland, who as at first they did hatch a most groundlesse Rebellion against his Majestie of ever glorious memorie, so when his Majestie had graunted them (by their own confession) even all their violent and most injust demands, they were notwithstanding so farre from being satisfied therewith, that (being themselves unable to finde any further
pretences) they did perjuriously sollicite a partie in the Kingdome of England to begin there, where shame or necessitie had forced them to breake off. And when the English (being, by much, lesse wicked) would often have been contented with his Majesties extraordinarie Concessions, for as then many did not intend those desperate lengths (which the faall successe of a Rebellious warre, and the cruell crafiesse of some mlicious, hollow-hearted men did thereafter drive them unto) these notable Jgglers, (to adde oyle to the fire, and to keep green wounds still raw) did intrude themselves into their counsells, till they had brought: affaires into a condition past all cure. And not contented to act this their so boudie a Tragedi in the foxe skinne alone, or as it were behind the hangings, (which indeed could never have compassed all their wicked ends) when they had received all Imaginable satisfaction at home (winesse their very own publicke Acts of Parliament, wherein they confesse that His Late Mjsty parted a cotented King from a contented people.) They pull off the , and appeae in that of a Lyon, or rather a Wolfe, a beast, as farre lesse Gene∣rou, so farre more Cruell. For when they found their Rebell-brood, which they had begot in Engand, begin to lessen, and that his Majesties partie appeared to have by much the better, They, (not onely contrary to the dutie of Subjects, but also contrary to all Faith, Covenants, Oaths, Attestations, to which they had so often invoked God, his Angells, and all the world as witnesse,) did enter the Kingdom of England with a strong Armie, did persecute their own Prince in a forraigne Countrey, did assist strange Rebells against their native King, and all those who continued in their Loyaltie to his Majestie in that King∣dome; which trayterous poceedings of theirs, the whole world doth know, was the onely cause which stopped the course of his Majesties victories, and of bring∣ing that unnaturall warre to such a conclusion, as all good men could have wished. And not ashamed of all this (which even many of their owne partie doe blush to own) when his late Majestie reduced (by God knowes how many Treacheris) to thinke upon courses of greatest extremitie for his safetie, was pleased (of his invincible goodnesse, and naturall inclination towards his owne native people, notwithstanding all their former Treasons and Rebellions) to commit himselfe to the protection of that Ignoble, and Ingratefull faction, hoping that whom his Greatnesse, and their owne dutie could not oblige, His miserie at least, and an act of so great Trust, and Confidence, might move to pittie, and Compassion: They, contrary to all Faith, and pactions, Dutie of Subjects, Lawes of Hospitalitie, Nature, Nations Divine, or Humane, an action so barbarous, (which as it never had any president that it may follow, so wee hope it will never be followed by any subsequent imitation) most infa∣mousl, and beyond all possible expressions of Basenesse, to the blush of Chri∣stians,
and the abomination of all mankinde) sold their Soveraigne to their mercilesse fellow-Rebells, and fellow-Traitors, to be by them Murthered. For it is more then too too evident by the frequent, and secret intercourses both before, and at the time of that horrid, never enough detested parricide, and by their mutuall correspondence, and familiarity since, that the Rebellious facti∣ons in both Nations did unanimously conspire and plot the Destruction of His late Gracious Majesty, now a glorious Martyr: nor is it a small aggravati∣on (if any circumstance can aggravate so bloody a deed) that his late Maje∣sty justly jealous of their more then Punick faiths, did resolve first to engage them to his protection before he would put himselfe into their hands; of which by a long Treaty and many intercourses he received all manner of Assurance. This indeed they are so much ashamed of, that they would gladly cover it with some frivolous excuses; yet the secret guilt of their owne consciences, and the Pub∣lick knowledge the World hath of so undeniable a Truth, shuts up even their most imudent mouthes in silence. And so little are these Godie▪ and Religious men toucht with any sence of what mischieves they have already done, that they begin afresh with his Majestie Our now Gracious Soveraigne upon the same score, where they left with his Father of ever blessed memorie. They Declare him indeed to be their King, but with such conditions, and provisoes, as Robb him of all right and power. For while they pretend to give him a little, which he must accept of as from them, they spoile him of all that power and authority, which the Law of God, of Nature, and of the Land, hath invested him with, by so long conti∣nued descent from his famous predecessors: They presse him to joyne with those, who by a sacrilegious Covenant have confederated all his Dominions in Re∣bellion, and laid all Royall power in the Dust, which in effect were no∣thing better then that he himselfe should asperse with infamy the sacred memo∣ry of his ever glorious Father, that he should with his owne hands destroy him∣selfe, and ruine all such, who have still beene loyall to him in his thre King∣domes. These are the men, who first entring England sollicited those of their faction to rise in that desperate Rebellion (as a prolouge to the ensuing Tra∣gedie which they meant to act) These are they who were the chiefe, and maine instruments of all the Battaills, slaughters, and bloody occasions within that or their owne Kingdome; These are they who sold their Soveraigne, to a bloody and infamous death; yea these are they, who still digg in his Grave, and who are more pernitiously hatching the destruction of his present Majesty, by the same bare, old, antiquated treacheries, then ever they did that of his most ex∣cellent, and most innocent Father. NOtwithstanding all which because the greatest part of the People of the Kingdome of Scotland, hath beene hitherto ignorantly misguid∣ed
to follow their Leaders, not knowing the pernicious ends their wicked Counsells did drive at, which they had wrapped up in specious coverings; but have now most of them (by Gods mercy) their eyes opened, and their hearts inflamed to returne (at least in their desires) to their due obedience towards their most Gratious Soveraigne: And because even in the worst times there never anted a loyall partie of men of all sorts, and conditions, who still gave evident Demonstrations of their unwearied loyallty and fidelity, their sincere duties and affections to their dread Soveraigne, His Majesty even in contemplation of those righteous ones is mooved with a tender passion of all such, who now at last, have a true remorse, and doe seriously repent them of their former Error, and wick∣ednesse. His gracious Majestie therefore, out of a Fatherly affection to all his people, and subjects, especially those of the Kingdome of Scotland, is not onely willing, and ready to pardon all, and every one (xcepting such who upon cleare evidences shall be found guilty of that most dam∣nable parricide on the person of his Deare Father) who upon the sight or knowledge of this Our Declaration, doe immediately, or with the first possible opportunity, abandon those Rebells, and rise, and joyne with us, and our Focs, in this present service. But also promiseth in the word of a Prince, (which he desires all men to be most assuredly perswaded of) that so soone as God shall be pleased to inable him, he will with the advise, and consent of the lawfull, and ordinary supreme, Judi∣catories in that Kingdome, ratifie and confirme whatever hath been done by his Royal Father, in order to their peace. Nor doth his Majesty re∣quie or demand any more of them but that they would returne to their dutyfull obedience, and afford him their faithfull Service to revenge that horrid murther of his Royal Father, to reestablih himselfe in his just po∣wer and Government, and to procure their owne perpetuall peace and hap∣pinesse. Wherefore, what ever true Scotch-man there is, who hath any sence of his duty left him towards God, his King, Countrey, Friends, Wife, Chil∣dren, or Houses, or would change (now at last) the Tyranny, violence, or oppression of those Reblls, with the mild, and innocent Government of their just Prince, or revenge the horrid and execrable murther of their sacred King, redeeme their Nation from infamy, and themselves from slavery, restore the present, and oblige all ages to come. Let them as Chri∣stians, Subjects, Patriots, Friends, Husbands, and Fathers, joyne thm∣selves forthwith with us, in this present service which is so full of Con∣science, Duty, Honor, and all just interests. And let no man so much
feare, or apprehend things future, and uncertaine, as abhor those present evills, under which they groane, since no calamities can match, much lesse outstrip, that vile and unjust servitude, which now oppresses them. For however at the first blush the enterprize may seeme hard, and full of many and great difficulties, yet let not Christians and men of courage doubt of Gods Justice, and that perpetuall care wherewith he watches o∣ver Princes, or their owne resolutions, or the fortunes of those with whom they are joyned, and by whom they are Commanded. But let them resolve with Joab to play the men for their people, and the Citties of their God. And let the Lord doe what seemeth him good wherein what∣ever shall befall them, they may, at least be assured of CRASTINUS his recompence, that Dead, or a Live, the World will owe and pay them deserved thanks. MONTROSSE. THe Declaration of the Scotts in answer to this of Montrosse, being very long, and much of it, tending onely to justifie their proceedings while their Army was in England, being that with which they have of∣ten vexed the Presse before, and which for the most part hath received such Answers as were never replyed unto; I have thought fit to save the reading of that which is not to the present purpose, to Extract out of their large Declaration onely those Passages that looke at the person of Montrosse: this being intended, onely to shew the world what Opi∣nion they professe to have of each other.
EXTRACTS OF A DECLARATION OF THE COMMITTEE OF ESTATES Of the Parliament of SCOTLAND .In Vindication of their proceedings from the aspersions of a scandalous Pamphlet, published by that excommunicate Traytor, JAMES GRAHAME. Vnder the title of a Declaration of James Marques of Mon∣rosse, &c. Printed in the yeare, 1649. AS ALSO OF A DECLARATION And Warning unto all the Members of this KIRK and KINGDOM, In answer to a paper intituled and reputed the Declaration of JAMES GRAHAME By the Commission of the Generall Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland. EDINBVRGH, Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie. 24. January. 1650.
EXTRACTS OUT OF A DECLARATION of the Committee of Estates of the Parliament of Scotland, In Vindication of their proceedings from the aspersions of a scan∣dalous Pamphlet, published by that excom∣municate Traytor, James Grahame, un∣der the title of a Declaration of James Marques of Montrosse, &c. Printed 1649. IT may seem strange to such as know the state of af∣faires in this Kingdome, that we should thinke it worth the while to answer the slanders and ground∣lesse reproaches of that viperous brood of Sathan, James Grahame, whom the Estates of Parliament have long since declared traytor, the Church hath delivered into the hands of the devill, and the Nation doth generally detest and abhor. Since we know there hath been and will be in all ages a wicked rabble of godlesse men, who make it their worke to follow the righteous cause with aspersions and calumnies, and it is an endlesse labour to answer every voyce that speaks against the truth; and seeing also at length the innocencie of our cause, the integrity of our hearts, and the candor of our actions will prevaile over the malicious tongues of our adversaries, yet because our silence may be subject to misconstruction, and some of the weaker sort may be in∣veagled by the bold assertions and railing accusations of this impudent Braggard, presenting himselfe to the view of the world, clothed with his Majesties Authority as Lievtenant Governour and Captain Generall of this Kingdom: We shall shortly answer what is said against us, take off the make which he hath put on, and expose him to publick view in his own apparell. This excommunicate Traytor in the first place, chargeth his own Nation
with hatching a Rebellion in this Kingdome, then with the promoting the like in England, and lastly, with the sale and murther of their native King, and robbing his Son of all right; horrid crimes indeed, if true: But, &c. 4.His lst and main forgeries against us, are, that his late Majesty being redcted to thinke on extream courses, did engage us by a Treaty, and ha∣ving got all manner of assurance from us, did cast himselfe in the hands of our Army which was sent into England for assistance of the two Houses of Parliament against the Popish, Prelaticall and Malignant par∣ty; And that we, contrary to all faith, pction and duty, sold our Sove∣raign, and afterwards complotted his destruction, and now begin upon the same score with the Son, dclaring him King with provisoes, and rob∣ing him of all right while we would seeme to give some unto him, and are more perniciously hatching the destruction of his present Majestie then ever we did his sacred Fathers. What a strange contexture of multiplied lies doth this malicious man heap together? In all this, there is not one word true, save one, that his Majestie was redacted to think on extream courses, and that makes a∣gainst him; for Sir Thomas Fairfax, having defeated the Kings forces in the fields, suddenly resolves to block up Oxford, where the King was in person, thinking that the shortest way to put an end to their troubles, wherewith his Majestie being surprized, privatly escapes with two or three from Oxford, &c. And that it is a malicious wicked device and manifest untruth, that wee sold our King; wee abhorre the very thought of it as sincerely as wee doe abho∣minate the treacherous actions of that perfidious Traytor James Grahame, who, as a childe of the Devil, hates to speake truth. As to the remainder of that which is said against us by that wretched man, that wee complotted his late Majesties destruction, and have Decla∣red his Sonne King with provisoes, robbing him of all right, and are more perniciously hatching the destruction of his present Majestie then ever wee did his royall Fathers. Wee say no person on earth has contribu∣ted more toward his Majesties ruine then James Grahame himselfe. In the beginning of our troubles, the Lord having put it into the hearts of his people of this Land to renew their nationall Covenant formerly taken by King James, in the yeare 1580. That dissembling Hypocrite James Grahame, then Earle of Montrosse, did with teares in his eyes, and both his hands lifted up to Heaven sweare the words of that Covenant unto the Lord, in the publick Assembly of his people; but being a man of a meane and desperate fortune, and not meeting with that esteeme and re∣ward
which be in his vanity, proposed to himselfe, at the first pacificati∣on he began to hearken to the promises of the Court, and to study a facti∣on within; and hold correspondence with the adverse paty without the Kingdome, and by false information, to dvde his Majety fom his people. is base and treacherous practises were divese times discove∣red, and himselfe made ashamed, yet would he not give over untill at length he was made prisoner in the Castle of Edinburgh, and afterward brought to his Tryall before the Committee, for tryall of plotters and incendiaries, appoynted by his Majesty, and the estates of Parliament, where he was found guilty of perjury and treachery, and had he then re∣ceived his due punishment according to justice, he had not troubled the World since; but such was the mercy and favour of his Majesty, and the Estates of Parliament, as he was pardoned, and no further Censure in∣flicted upon him, but that his Majesty declared and caused it to be inserted in the records of Parliament, that he should be incapable of any office or place, in the Court or Common wealth, and not have accesse to his Majesties person; yet not long after his enlargement, contrary to his owne promise and the Articles of the large Treaty betwixt his Majesty and this Kingdome, he repaired to his Majesty in England, and obtained a Commission for in∣vading his native Countrey, which shortly thereafter he did attempt up∣on the South borders, and was repulsed, but rather then faile in his de∣signes, he choosed to joyne himselfe with that Barbarous crew of Popish I∣rish Rebells, which invaded this Kingdome upon the North, with whose assistance (and of some unnaturall Countrymen, voyd of all Religion and hu∣manity) taking advantage of the quitnesse and security of this King∣dome, when their Armies were abroad in England and Ireland, he did cru∣elly destroy with the Sword diverse thousands of his owne Countreymen, spoyled many of their goods, burned Houses and Cornes, ravished Women, murthered old and young, killed Ministers, complyed with Papists, countenanced Idolaters, and despised the Worship of God; for which abominable Crimes, and his Re∣bellion and Treason, as he was excommunicated by the Church, so he was de∣clared Traitor by the Estates of Parliament, his Coat of Armes torne, and his Estate forefaulted: But for all this, he is not weary of committing wickednes, and therefore would returne into this Kingdome to over-act all his former trans∣gressions and abominations. But if he shall come, we trust in God it is that he may be brought to a shamefull death, and cursed end, and here receive from the hand of justice his deserved punishment, where he hath murthered so many of the Lords people, and Julian-like hath made Apostasie from that cause and Covenant to which he was so Solemnly Engaged by Oath and Subscripti∣on.
To gaine supplies abroad and assistance at home, this vaine m doth publish this his Declaration under the name and Title of Lievtenant Governour and Captaine Generall for his Majesty of the Kingdome of Scotland. Upon what bare pretences he did formerly obtaine a Com∣mission from his late Majesty to invade this Kingdome, we shall not now descant, bu we are very sure that there was scarce any act his Made could have done that was more destructive to his owne interest or more dis∣pleasing to this Kngedom, it being expresly contrary to the ties and bands betwixt King and people; and here we may justly retort upon James Grahame, that he doth begin with the Son upon the same score that he left with the Father, for whither he hath really obtained such a Com∣mision from his Majesty, or doth onely abuse his name, certainly he is not capable of doing his Majesty greater dis-service then is held forth in that Declaration. The King received our Commissions in Holland, and the Parliaments Letter, and treated with them, he denyed that he had given any Commission to James Grahame, or any other, to invade this Kingdome, and promised a further answer to our desires, by an Expresse from himselfe which is never yet come unto us. The straine and scope of the Declaration makes the whole Ntion, the party whom his Maje∣sty gives Commission to invade and destroy, for it condemnes all the proceedings of the Kingdome: even at the very first beginning of these troubles, as the Rebellion of an horrid and infamous faction of Rebells, at first causlesly hached against his late Majesty of glorious memory, notwithstanding they were approved by his Majesty in the yeare 1639. at the Treaty at Berwick, wherein James Grahame himselfe was an actor and consenter. It condemns all the proceedings of this Kingdome in the yeare 1640. notwithstanding his Majesty is obliged in the large Trea∣ty (which is ratified in the Parliament of both Kingdomes) for him∣selfe and his successors by his promise in verbo Principis, never to come in the contrary thereof, nor any thing therein contained, but to hold the same firme and stable in all poynts, and that he shall cause it to be truely observed by all his Majesties Leidges, according to the tenour and intent thereof for now and ever, these are the very words of the Treaty. And now what can be imagined to be a security to the Subjects of this King∣dome, if that which their King is solmnly ingaged unto by promise, for himselfe and his successours, in verbo Principis, and confirmed in the Par∣liaments of both Kingdomes, shall not onely be questioned, but their de∣sires agreed unto by his Majesty declared to be violent and most unjust. And all this is not enough to quarrell Treaties and Established lawes, and to accuse the whole Nation, but they are by this Declaration accounted
more wicked then any in England, or Ilnd, this miserable miscreant is bet∣ter pleased with the Sectaries or the Irish Rebells, then with his native Coun∣trey, wherein he declares his Apostacy to be of such a stamp, as he can sooner reconcile with all the World, the with the cause and Covenant, which he did once sweare to maintaine and defend. If he may but sit and judge all those in the Kingdome, who have kept the Oath of God, and made conscience of their Covenant, shall be found accessory to the murther and ruine of the King, and all those who have perjured them∣selves, and made apostacy from the cause and Covenant, as he hath done, shall be justified as the onely righteous persons of the Nation, as he is pleased to style them in his Declaration. Neither is this the height of his insolency and ambition, but in the Frontispeice of that Pamphlet he is exalted to be Governour of Scotland, as if it were a Province or Con∣quered Nation, a title which our Ancestors would never endure in the person of any but the King, and we trust in God it shall never take place in this nor any subsequent Generation. Is it not a sad and lamentable thing, that when his Majesty hath lost possession of the Kingdome of England, is in litle better condition for Ireland, and onely Scotland is desirous to imbrace him, upon grant of their just desires, there should yet be such Counsellors about his Mjesty, as would advise him no other wayes to come to his Throne in Scotland, but by Conquest, and before the Conquest be made, to declare the Governour, and to choose that Governour, such a one as is more generally hated by many degrees, then any person of the Nation. What greater provocations can be given then these? Or what designe worse then this, can be set on Foote to make his Majesty and his people irreconcilable? but we know that no bounds can be set to the wickednesse of this malicious man, who had rather see both King and Kingdome utterly ruined, then that his owne designes should faile, and therefore we are very unwilling to thinke that these things are done with his Majesties knowledge and approbation, but rather that his Majesties Name is abused in that pretended Declaration, or if there hath beene any Commission granted unto him, that it hath been sur∣reptitiously purchased from his Majesty; in which opinion we desire to rest, and shall patiently wait for his Majesties Answer to our desires now againe presented to his Majesty in the Isle of Jersey. These things being duely weighed and considered by forrain Princes and States, wee trust that since we have never done any injury or wrong to them, but have rather been ready to performe all friendly duties in our power, as we have had occasion and opportunity, and seeing we one∣ly desire to enjoy our Religion and Liberties under his Majestie, accord∣ing
to the word of God, and the Lawes and Constitutions of this Kik and Kingdome, and are most willing, upon just satisfaction given to our desires presented to his Majesty, and published to the world in Print, not onely to receive his Majesty, and submit to his Government; but also to contribute our best endeavoure by all lawfull and necessary means accor∣ding to the Covenant, and the duty of faithfull Subjects, that his Majesty may be restored to the peaceable possession of the Government of his other Kingdomes; they will be mindfull of that Common Rule of Justice knowne by the light of nature, and confirmed by our Saviour Christ, Whatsoever yee would that men should doe to you, doe so to them. And there∣fore as they would expect from us in the like case, wee doe expect from them that they will neither contribute men nor moneys, nor any other ad or assistance to a declared Traytor, who is neither seeking his Majesties honour and happinesse, nor the good of his native Countrey, but meerly to satisfie his own lusts and ambitious ends, and designes. But in a speciall manner we doe expect from all Protestant Princes and States, that they will remember what is said to Jehosapht for assi∣sting Achab. Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord. And that as they desire to keepe the Communion of Saints, they will forbeare to give him either countenance or assistance, but looke upon him as a person justly ex∣cluded from civill society for his Treasonable practises, and excommunicated from the Church of Christ, for his aminable transgressions. If he shall come into this Kingdome, we are confiden that all those in whom the sense of the feare of God, duty to the King, and affections to their native Countrey, is not utterly decayed and extinguished, will heartily and unanimously joyne to resist and oppose him, and to use their best endeavours, that he may be brought to condigne and exemplary punishment. But if there shall be any found in the land so foolish, base, and treache∣rous, as to hearken to the vaine promises, and empty professions of that scan∣dalous, wicked, and infamous Pamphlet, published under the name of a Decla∣ration of his Excellency James Marquesse of Monrosse; Lievtenant Governour, and Captain Generall for his Majestie of the Kingdome of Scotland, (which in detestation thereof, wee have caused burne publickly at the Crosse of Edin∣burgh, by the hand of the Common Hangman) and shall ayd or assist the said James Grahame, in his wicked designes against Religion, King, and King∣dome. Wee doe hereby declare all such as shall joyne or concurre with him or his adherents in armes, to be guilty of High Treason, and to be punished and pro∣ceeded against as the Parliament or their Committees, shall thinke fit;
And doe further discharge all persons of whatsoever quality or degree, to joyne with them in any Oath, Band, or Association whatsoever, or to assist or supply them and their adherents, or any of them with Men, Mo∣ney, Armes, Ammunition, Victuall, Counsell, or Intelligence, or to keep any sort of correspondence publick or private with them, or any wayes to ayd or countenance them, or any of them, under the paine of being esteemed as Rebels, and proceeded against as the Parliament or their Committees shall thinke fit; and this wee declare to be instead of all Letters of inter∣commoning. And Power and Warr and is hereby given to all good Subjects within the Kingdome, to rise in Armes for opposing and suppressing all such as shall joyne in Rebellion, as they shall be called and required thereunto by the Lord Generall, Lievtenant Generall, or any others having authoritie for that effect. And for the encouragement of al such as shall suffer in opposing or suppressing them, Wee doe further declare, that not onely the losses and sufferings of such as shall be active in the cause against them, shall be taken in speciall consideration, and repaired out of the Estates of such as shall joyne in Rebellion, as aforesaid; but their service shall be rewarded, according as they shall be found to deserve; And wee doe ordaine these presents to be printed and published at the Mercat Crosse of Edinburgh, and other ordinary places of publication need∣full.

EDINBURGH, 2. January 165. Antemeridiem. The Declaration and Warning of the Commission of the Generall Assembly unto all the Members of this Kirk and Kingdome, In answer to a paper, intituled and reputed The Declaration of James Grahame. ALbeit the carriage of those who are engaged in the worke of Reformation in this Land hath been from he beginning so agreeable to the rule of the Word of God, and of sound reason, and so eminently own∣ed and blessed by the Lord in all the tenour and procdour thereof, as may sufficiently refute all the calumnies of enemies, and strengthen his people a∣gainst all their slanders and attempts for undoing of the same; Yet least our silence in this day of blasphemy and rebuke should be construed ei∣ther as a neglect of our dutie, or as weaknesse through the sense of the guilt, to wipe off the aspersions that are vented to the world in the name of that excommunicate and forfeited Traytor James Grahame, wee have resol∣ved till there may be opportunitie for a larger Declaration, shortly to touch the revilings contained in that paper, and to declare unto men their dutie in reference to such purposes and desires as are holden forth therein. In the first place the instruments of the worke of Reformation are charged as an horrid and infamous faction of rebells, who did hatch a rebel∣lion against his late Majestie: But to say nothing that that wretched man was accessorie unto the laying of the foundation of that blessed worke, which now in the blindnesse of his minde, and hardnesse of his heart, as being given up of God, as Pharaoh was, he calls rebellion. This is no o∣ther
then the common calumnie that hath been cast upon the servants of God from the beginning of the world in all their endeavours and at∣tempts for Reformation of Religion: Was it rebellion to stand to our defence, when in stead of an answer to all the earnest and reiterated sup∣plications and desires of this Land against the corruptions of doctrine, worship, discipline, and government, wee were invaded with an Army both by Sea and Land, that a yoke might be wreathed about our necks by oppression and violence? Not onely had wee the Lords Word, and the practise of the reformed Churches abroad, and of our owne Church at home in the dayes of our Fathers to justifie us in this, but also the King himselfe, who upon information did retract the Declaration set forth against u, and grant what we had desired. Nxt it is charge upon this Nation, that they did solicite a partie in the Kingdome of England to beginne where they had left off, and that find∣ing their rebell brood there beginning to lessen, They did, contrary to all Faith, Covenants, Oathes, &c. enter with a strong Army the Kingdome of England, persecute their Prince in a forreigne Nation, and assist a company of strangers rebells against their native King, &c. What was the grounds and first rise of the warre betwixt the King and the Parliament of England, needs not now to be repeated, being so well knowne every where; But this Naton were so farre from fomenting of the same, that for a long time they did mediate a peace; and so continued, untill England by their ear∣nest invitation, did for the preservation and Reformation of Religion, the honour and happinesse of the King, the peace and good of these Kingdome, crave their assistance against the Popish, Prelaticall and Ma∣lignant partie then in Armes, who were like to have destroyed all: For which end, when they had entred in a solemne League and Covenant with that Nation, as they did oblige themselves for the defence and pre∣servation of his Majesties Person and just Greatnesse and Authority in the defence and preservation of Religion, so they did never desist to solici his Majesty for satisfaction to the just desires of both Kingdomes, and were alwayes, upon his Majesties granting of the same, willing to admit him to the exercise of his Royall Power. Thirdly, It is alleaged, that after all manner of assurances given to his Majesty before his comming to the Scottish Armie, notwithstanding of assu∣rances, he was sold unto the English: But wee are confident that albeit all the generation of Malignants of the three Kingdomes have now for
three yeares together filled this and the Nations abroad with the noyse of such things, that yet to this day never any of them did, nor could bring any evidence of such assurance given, or such bargaine made by this Kingdome; nay such assurances were alwayes refused, and when the King did cast himselfe upon the Scottish Army, this Kingdome was so farre from making any sale of him, that they did not condescend to leave him wit his Subjct in England, untill sufficient surety was given by both Houses of Parliament, concerning the safety and preservation of his Majesties Person. It is reat malice to say, that because the Scottish Army, about the time of al Majesies living at New-Castle, did receive some part of those arrears due unto them for their painfull & faithfull service in Eng∣land, that therefore this Kingdome did ell their King; The arrears which were then received were due before the King came unto our Ar∣my, and in all probability had been more timously and cheerfully payd if he had not come thither at all. Fourthly, They are slandered as complotters of the Kings destruction by secre intercourses both before, in the time, and since his Majesties horrid mur∣ther: If those things be evident, why were not the proofs brought forth and produced before the world for convincing the authors and abetters thereof, and gaining credit to the cause of those that make so bold al∣leagance? The publick endeavours and Testimonies of this Kirk and Kingdome against the taking of his Majesties life, doe sufficiently refute all such secret and private whisperings. Lastly, they are charged as robbers of the King, who now is of all right, be∣cause of their declaring him King wîth provisoes: But are these provisoes or conditions any other then such as have been in the time of his predeces∣sors, and whereunto by the Lawes and constitutions of this Kingdome he is obliged, and without which, Religion, and the peace of the Kingdome cannot be secured. These, and the like slanders are made a ground of invitation unto the people of this Land to abandon the cause, and worke of Reformation, and to rise in Armes against the Parliament and Kingdome, and joyne themselves with such Forces as that Monster of men, and his complices shall make use of for invading of this land; to which he labours to per∣swade a promise of pardon for what is past, and of his Majesties resolu∣tion to be ever ready to ratifie, so soon as it shall please God to put it in his po∣wer,
according to the advise of the supreme Judicatories of this Kingdome, all what has been done by his Royall Father, in order to our peace. Though we should be silent and say nothing, we are perswaded that there be none in the Land who has any regard to truth or righteousnesse, or in whom a∣ny sponk of the love of the Lords work, or of this Countrey does resid, but as they abhominate and abhor the very name of that excommunicate wretch, and thinke these lies worthy of no other entertainment then is to be allowed to the devises of the Father o lies, unto whose hands he is delivered; so we are confident that they will dest and avoid all such desperate and wicked designes, attempted whither by him or by any o∣ther. Shall men, after so many solemn vowes and promises before the Lord, and his hand lifted up so high in making plaine before them, the way wherein they should walke, be so blind and base, as to be charmed into a most godlesse course against Religion and the blood of the Lords people by the offer of a pardon, where there has been no transgression but a following of duty? Or shall any be cheated into delusion by a flourish of most ambiguous words of his Majesties resolution to be ever ready to ratify, so soone as it shall please God to put him in his power according to the advise of the supreame Judicatories of this Kingdome, all what has beene done by his royall Father in order to our peace? To say no∣thing, that the League and Covenant and the Union betwixt the King∣domes, and the whole worke of Uniformity, is here cut off at one clap, though yet we trust that these things will be dearer to all the Lords peo∣ple in the Land, then their Estates or lives: The words are so empty and doubtfull, as may suffer any interpretation men list to put upon them, and may consist with the utter undoing of all that has been done in this Land for asserting the purity of Religion, and the liberty of the Sub∣ject. His Majesty must first be put in power, before he ingage himselfe to doe any thing at all, and when in power, no obligation upon him, un∣lesse the supreame Judicatories of the Kingdome shal so advise; neither is it determined what these judicatories are, whither his Majesty shall be obliged to follow the advise, and which is more strange, Religion is not so much as named in all the concession, but all is wrapped under the no∣tion of these things which the King his royall Father granted in order to our peace: which may be so expounded as to take in things Civill onely that concerne the peace of the Kingdome, or at the best, insinuates the motive of all that his Majesty granted concerning Religion to this King∣dome,
to have beene onely a desire of peace, and not any thing in Religi∣on it selfe, and so drawes along with it a secret reflection upon the Na∣tionall Covenant, and all the work of God relating thereto, and con∣cludes them alterable as the change may produce peace or Warr. We thinke we need not desire any man to consider what could be the case of Religion, and of all that love is in this Land, if it were in the po∣wer of that persidious and proud Atheist, to modell the supreame Judi∣catories of the Kingdome according to his minde: hee who hath so far forgotten his Covenant and Oath, in which he enterd in so publick and solemn a way, as to call all that is contained therein, and has flowed there from violent and most unjust desires, and the worke of Reformation, from the beginning Rebellion, will not spare the overturning and de∣stroying thereof, and the bringing back this poore Nation to the licking up of the vomit of prelacy, the ceremonies and the Service-Book, for making way to a fuller compliance with the Church of Rome: which we have the more cause to feare, for that the free excercise and full liber∣ty of Popish Religion is granted by his Majesty to those bloody Rebells in Ireland. To us it is above question, that as the alteration of Religi∣on, and the establishing of an arbitrary and i limited power for bringing the same about, was the designe from the beginning, so that the same is still promoted by the Popish, Prelaticall, and Malignant party, and shall (if they prevaile) be the fruit of their works. Therefore, as the Servants of the living God, we warne and obtest all the Lords people throughout the Land, that as they would not draw on themselves the wrath of the most high God, by breach of Covenant and grosse backsldings, that they doe not hearken to any such calumnis and slanders; nor suffer themselves by the power thereof to be drawne from their stedfastnesse, or to give any connivance, let be countenance or assist∣ance unto any who shall invade this Kingdome, or raise Warre therin, under pretence of Commission from his Majesty, and putting him in the excercise of his Royall power before satisfaction had from him, to the just and necessary desires of this Kirk and Kingdome, concerning Religion and the Covenant. The late Generall Assembly, in their Declaration, did by many grave and undenyable reasons, demonstrate the unlawfull∣nesse and sinfullnesse of any such attempt; and it shall be now seasona∣ble for any man, who doubts to make use of these things for satisfying his Judgement, and convincing him in the poynt of conscience, that he may not dash himselfe against the rock of the Lords power, which shall
certainly breake in peices all those that oppose themselves to his work, and lead forth with the workers of iniquity, all those that turne aside to their crooked wayes. Albeit, the avenging hand of the most high, hath pursued and follow∣ed with vengeance, many of those who assisted that unnaturall man in the shedding of the blood of his Countrey, and that many of them have tasted of the bitter fruits both of civill and ecclesiastick censures, and that a temptation to so great a wickednesse from such a one as James Grahame, seeme to be so grosse as may scarre most of the Malignant party them∣selves, who yet continue in opposition to the worke of God, let be those who have humbled themselves for their former complyances with evill courses, or have kept their integrity without swarving; yet it shall be the wisdome of all within the Land, to guard their hearts by prayer and sup∣plication, and to arme themselves with the strength of the Lord against defection. Experience hath proven throughout all the tract of the word of God, that many hath fallen off from day to day, and that new trialls have produced new discoveries of the hollownesse of the hearts of some, concerning whom many did promise to themselves better things; none can be stedfast in the Covenant, but those, whose hearts are right with God: we wish therefore every man to search and try his wayes, and as to repent of all his former provocations, so in the strength of the Me∣diator Jesus Christ, to study to walk with God, and to order his con∣versation aright; then may we be confident that the Lord shall establish us, and that no Weapon that is formed against us shall prosper, and that every Tongue that riseth against us in Judgement we shall con∣demn.

HEE that shall looke backe but a few yeares, and shall consider what these two parties have done to and suffered by each other. And shall with∣all observe the present Style and Language ex∣changed between them, will easily believe the controversie such, the animosity so high, and the feu'd so deadly, as nothing but the extirpation of one partie is like to end and put it out Unlesse that happy time were now ready to blesse the world, when the Wolfe shall dwell with the Lambe, and the Leopard lye downe with the Kid; when none shall any more hurt or destroy in all the holy Mountaine of God, and the Earth become full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the Sea. But as it is, Montrosse is come into Scotland An incense Enemy, to the now governing partie there, ingaged against them by his owne Declaration, from which he cannot recede with honour and reputation, to take up with lesse than full satisfacti∣on, were to pleade guiltie to all their accusation. And he comes also provoked by this Declaration of theirs, wherein they have represented him (to the utmost power of Language) for such, as if they can hereafter take hands with him, there will be little reason to doubt, but (if Interest should require it) they can also make an agreement with Hell it selfe; for on this side THAT twill be hard to finde any that may beare all those Titles and Attributions they have bestowed upon him. This Man comes amongst them to head a numerous discon∣tented faction there. He comes Armed with the pleipotency of full Commissions from their King, of Generalissimo both by Sea and Land; signalized with Markes of his speciall fa∣vour, in sending him lately from Jersey a little before his
going thence the Order of the Garter, besides those Caresses in his late Letter to him published to the world. How little the governing partie in Scotland hath gained up∣on their King, by all their addresses to him this yeare past both in Holland and at Jersey, is evident in his Letter to the Committee of Estates, sent by Libbertoun, which hath been also published. The greatest hope left them of him, is, that his Mother (who meets him at Beauvis in his journey to Breda) will instill into him some of her Maximes and Principles, that may divert him from Montrosse, and encline him to close with them; which if she should effect in foure dayes, (which he is determined to stay there) or in eight, for so long it seems shee would have the Conference hold for his beter instruction, (if their purses will beare it) it would be some∣thing strange, considering his knowne inclination to Mon∣trosse, and perfect hatred of the other. If shee doe prevaile, he is like to prove a blessed Instrument to promote or settle the Reformation of Religion they so so∣lemnly hold out, when he shall be wrought to it by his Mo∣ther, and act upon her Principles, whose Religion is believed to be as farr from theirs, as theirs from the Sectaries. It is a Riddle that the Queene his Mother should wish well to Presbytery. A little time will shew us the effects of her Councells. If shee prevaile with him to desert Montrosse, whom he hath so entrusted, impowered, Caressed, and dignified, what as∣surance can he give the Scotts, that he will not also desert them, when his or his Mothers Interest shall require it, and he shall have power to doe it. If he doth continue to carry on his designes by Montrosse, are not they in a sine condition the meane time, to suffer themselves to be rocked asleepe by a Treaty, till Montrosse shall be able to march all over Scotland?
But if it were but possible by some State Magick to charme the enmitie betweene Montrosse and the Scots, so as notwithstanding all the ingagements, and provocations of these Declarations, they should yet unite in one, to settle their King, both among themselves, and also in these pre∣tensions to England and Ireland; were it not rare jugling? and were they not a fine parcell of men for any people of this Nation to hold correspondency and Cabals withall? and to hope by them to be delivered, from the Images of their grievances drawne and multiplyed in their fancies, by their causelesse discontents. Have they not had experience of their former comming into this Nation for ALL OUR GOODS, and can any man believe after such jugling among themselves, they are ever like to keepe faith with any others? If the the Conference at Beauvais, nor the Treaty at Breda, worke neitheir of these rare effects, but that the King of Scotland, follow his owne naturall inclination to persue his Interests, by Montrosse, Scotland will have work enough to doe and cause them though (perhaps) not time enough repent them, that ever they espoused that quarrell which is like to prove so funest to their POORE Kingdome. This is Licensed to be Printed by Matthew Simmons, together with the Declaration of Montrosse. GUALTER FROST.
