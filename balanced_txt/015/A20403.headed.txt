FOrasmoche as Isidore wytnessith in his first boke de summo bono ca .iiii. that almyghty god shewith to vs by example and consideracyon of thinges circomscripte and of kno¦wyn kynde. Parte of such thinges as be incircumschripte / and cannot playnly be vnderstonde or knowin that by euidente knowlege of thinges that be in apparē¦ce / the more rypely we mow comprehende the inwarde meanyge / that outwarde playnly shewith not. & by ye same path that man erryd from God / he may be rudu∣cyd and retourne to him agayne / and as he was pluc∣kyd by his own concupiscens and inordinate loue of the creature / from the greate loue of his lorde & maker. So by inspeccyon of the creat beawte of creaturys he owith to be refourmyd and to gyue lawde & worshippe to the incomparable creator & maker of al thinge / & thowghe it be so that as this booke faynith / these creaturis spe∣ke not to vs with mouth and voyce fourmyd neuerthe¦lesse by inclynacyon / & propirte of naturall institucyon they sece not to teche vs to corecte owr maners and a∣mende our lyuynge / the which the gloryows lyghte of all doctowris saint Augustin wytnessith for he saith in his wrytinge. O lorde God saith he / all thy Creaturis which thou haste made / crye to me and sece not that I owe to loue the my lorde god and maker aboue all othir thinge / & therfore the autor & compositor of this Boke for our holsome erudicyon & lernynge to auoyde slouth and sluggysshnesse and to inbuce the myndes of the he∣rers to quyknesse & deuocyon / hath compylyd this tre∣tys that the more esyly we mowe vnderstonde the mo∣rall sense includyd in the same.

¶ Of the Sonne and the Mone. Dialogus Primus. AFter the Philosofers sayng / the Sōne is the Iye of the worlde / the gladnes & the Iocundyte of the day / the beawtye of Heuyn / the mesure of tymes / ye ver∣tewe and origynall of all thinges gro∣wynge / the lorde of all planettys / the ledar and perfectoure of all planettys & sterrys. ¶ The Moone also as sayth Ambrose in Eyameron / is the beawtye of the nyght / moder & my∣nistre of all humours / mesure of all tymes / gyder of the See / chaunger of the ayre / folower of the sonne. And forasmoch as she is most lyke vnto the sonne / vpon a tyme she began to detracte and diffame the sonne / the whiche he perceyuyng spake to the moone & sayd? Why doyst thowe bak byte me & blasfemyst me / I haue euer geuyn the lyght and goon afore the to thy profyte / and
thou hatest me and malicyously malignest ageynst me. Go from me quod the Mone for I loue the not. For thy gret brightnes cawseth me to be set lytell store by in the worlde. For & thou were not / I sholde be in gret dignite The Sōne answered and sayd. O thou vncurteys crea¦ture / be thou content with thy degre. For as I shyne in the day tyme & bere than the rule / So thou without im∣pedimēt occupyest all the nyght at thyne owne plesure. Let vs therfore mekely obey vnto our maker / & exalte nat thy selfe by pryde / but suffer me paciently to do as I am ordeyned / and do thou thy dutye. The mone con∣siderynge no reason / in great anger departed & gaderyd togyder all the sterrys / and began batell / & shot arowes ageynst the Sōne / & entendyd vtterly with dartis and arowes to smyte hym and destroy hym. The Sōne be∣inge aboue and at a vauntage seynge all this cruelnes / drewe out his sworde & smote the Mone a sonder. And threwe downe the Sterrys & sayde / As oftyn as thou arte rownde / I shall departe the. ¶ For thys cawse as fables reporte / the mone conceyueth nat townde / & ster¦ris often tymes fall downe. And so the mone was con∣fused and sayde. Lesse hurt is to the stryuer / to be parted in twayne Then to be all lost / and brought vnto vayne. SO in lyke wyse moche peple being inflate & blowē vp with pryde & elacion / wolde be lyke vnto ye sōn & haue domynacion aboue all other / & by their wyllys wolde yt none were aboue thē / nor lyke vnto thē / as the glose fayth. Pryde is a brēnyng eleuacyon in ye mynde. dispysing them yt be vnder / & wold be equall with them that be aboue / for why As Crisostom sayth / desyre of ex¦altacyō / is great syn / & vtterly to be dispysed / & suffrāce is worshipfull & cōmendable. It is written & sayd that
the prowde peple be lyft vp on height / because their fall sholde be the mor greuous / For he that falleth but lowe may sone aryse as ye Poete sayth. But he yt falleth from on hyghe / may nat so esely be restored to helth Brāches of a tree growynge alowe / be conyued from tēpesiys / as wryteth Crisostom. But they that be on hygh be oftyn tymes broken & in gret ieo{per}dye. Wherfor quint{us} Curci{us} sayth / that a serteyn {per}sone sayd vnto kynge Alexander that a tree beyng of great heyght / may ye soner be blowē vp by the rote. And though a Lyon be myghty & prowde yet be small byrdes fedde with his flesshe. ¶ A Philoso∣fer cam to the Tombe of Alexander & sayde / yesterday to this man suffysed nat all the worlde. Now is he suffy¦sed with the space of .vij. fote longe. And therfor pryde is to be reprouyd. &c. Of Saturn and the Clowde Dialogo. Secundo.
PHilosophers wryte that there be .vij. Planetis. That is to say / Saturne / Iupiter. Mars. Sol. Venus. Mercu¦rye. & Luna. But there is great space betwene planet & planet For as Moy¦ses greatest of philoforhers reherseth & sayth / and also it is written in ye goldyn legende / that euery compasse of euery planet hath in thiknes ye waye of .v .c yeres / that is to mene / as moche space as a man may iourney & walke iv .c. yerys so that dayly his iour¦ney extendid to xl. miles / & euery myle to bee in length ij. M. pace. Vppon a tyme a great thycke clowde began to exalt her selfe & sayd. Myn excellencie is great / for I may by interposiciō of my gretnes cawse that other pla¦netis may not shewe thēself in ye world but at my wyll. Seynge that I am vnder other planetis & may doo so moche / if I were exalted higher / then myght I do moch more. And thus this clowde prowdly ascēdid vpward tyll she I am to saturne. Saturne seyng thys clowde presumptuously aplyng to go aboue hym / was sore gre∣uid & sayd vnto her / what arte thow that couetyst with pryde to ascende there as neuyr man cam. I shall ascende aboue the quod the clowde / and ouuerthrowe the. That heryng Saturne & fore mouyd / ordeyned harneys & we∣pyn / & stoppid fast the waye / & threwe down the clowd and destroyde hym for euyr & sayde. ¶ He that couyteth to be aboue all. Noforce though he haue a fowle fall. SO befell it to Nabugodonosor which desirid to be a∣boue all other kynges & princes / & to be callyd kyng of all Kynges / and Lorde of all lordis. For pryde not consi¦deryng that almyghty god hath domynacion aboue all erthly lordships as it is specifyed Danyel .iiij. Whā the
harte of Nabugodonosor was lyfte vp be pryde / wherfor he was deposid from his dygnyte / wherof it was sayd vnto hym. The dwellyng of the shall be among wylde beastis / & god shall eiect the / & cast the owte fro mānys company / & thow shalt ete hay lyke an oxe and .vij. sea¦sons shalbe chaunged ouer the. It is wryttē in Hystory scolasticall that Nabugodonosor was not chanuged into a beast vnresonable by mutacion & chanuge of the body but by mutacion & alienaciō of his wytte & reson / & also the eloquēcie of his speche was taken from hym / & he se∣myd hym selfe that in his forlymmes of his bodye he was lyke to an oxe or a bull / & in his hynder partyes he thought hymself to be lyke a lyon. Danyell also / all the tyme of his alienacion prayde for hym so hartely / that the .vij. seasone / that is to saye .vij. yeres by his prayers were chaunged in to .vij. monethis. In the which .vij. monethis the space of .xl. dayes. he had great in firmy te and disease. Other .xl. dayes within the sayd .vij. mo¦nethis he retournyd to his mynde / & prayde with great mepynge so largely that his iyen were turned in to red∣nes / & lyke vnto rawe flesshe. Manyon went to haue a sight of hym / a stir that .vij. monthis were fully com∣plete & fulfyld / He was Reuokyd & callyd agayn vnto his firste estate / but he regnyd not inmediatly / for there were ordeyned, vij. Iuges / & so he cōtynued in abstinence & penaunce vnto the ende of .vij. yeres neuer etige bred nor flesshe / nor drank wyne in all that longe season. ¶ Of a Sterre callyd Transmontana / and other sterrys Dialogo Tercio.
A Sterre which is called Trāsmōtana standeth euer fixe in the nauyll of the Heuyn / & gothe neuer to declyne / nor laboureth nat by compasse circuler as other sterrys doth. It is as a marke or a path of the see / to the whiche shyp∣men geue great attendance. All other sterrys gadryd them togeder & cam to this sterre & sayd Thou sittest alway styll & haste eas & rest / and we go a¦bout & labour without rest and be thy seruantes. aryse thou a whyle and let an other be souerayn & occupy thy rome. To whom this sterre Trāsmonteyn answered & sayde / ye knowe nat what ye wold haue / for your desyre is nat lefull nor to you expedient / For I haue gret labor & great fatigacyon to rule you. And yf I dyd nat wysely conserue you in your places & mocyons / ye sholde gretly erre for lacke of a gode gyder. Wherfore I counsell you to be content & in peace. But the other sterris wolde nat be pleasyd / but rather more wylfuller to haue theyr peti¦cyon / and sayde all at onys. We pray the to suffer vs to chose an other gyder. Trasmontayn than beholdynge their frowarde wylfulnes / departed from them / & went & complayned to hys lorde & maker. The sterrys that seynge / made great exultacyon & gladnes / & aplyed thē
to make election of a newe gyder. but therin they cowde nat agree / but fell at varyance and began to fyght eche with other / & as shepe lackynge a shepherde / they erryd & fell out of good rule. at last whan they concidered the felicyte that they were in somtyme by the policye & gode gydinge of theyr soueraigne / & the great myserie yt was fallen to them for lacke of hym. They fell in repentance & came to theyr fyrst gyder & prayde hym to take them to grace & to rule them as he had done before / & confirmed hym in his worshyp / & sayd all with one voyce. The gyder that gydeth / with vertewe & grace Sholde neuer be changed / lest a worse haue his place EVyn so it is conuenyent for vs to do when we haue a gode ruler the whiche rightfully ruleth & gydeth vs / we be bownde to loue hym / & to do hym honor & worshyp / & nat lightly to chaunge hym / but cherysshe hym after our power for the great labour that he hathe to gyde vs for our wele. The degre of gouernance is cal¦led great worshyp / but it is a gret charge / as Barnard sayth / what is worshyp or power / but a great bourden & miserye. Or what is sublimyte or dignyte of the worlde but a perylous & doubtfull tempest. Who may be in wor¦shyp or prelacye without payn or tribulacyon. Or who is in dignyte without vanyte / as Valery telleth. lib .vii. of a Kynge that was of so great witte & so gret counsell / that whan ye Crowne was delyuered to hym he helde it longe betwene his handes or he set it vpon his hede / and consideringe it well and sayd. O noble & fortunable gar∣londe / how full of besynes and peryllart thou / Innume∣rable to be tolde. For as Augustyne sayth. There is no thynge more laboryous / more harde / nor more perylous / than is to haue great domynacyon or seignyorye. and therfore Valerius dothe shewe vnto vs in Libro .vii.
of Corneli scipion / that whan Spayn was fallen vnto hym / he answered & sayd he wolde nat go thyder / & she∣wed the cawse why / For he cowld nat do equite & right wysnes. For he thought hym selfe nat cōnynge ne suffi∣cyent to so great a worsship / & so great a peryll togeder. ¶ Of the Euyn sterre & the morowe sterre. Dialogo. Quarto. VEsperus is callyd the night sterre / and Lucifer the day sterre / which apperith in the mornyng. These two sterrys / gadryd togider all other sterrys & went with one assent to the creator & maker of all sterrys / & made vnto hym theyr sapplicacyon and sayde / Gracious Lorde thow arte a good maker / and we therfore thanke the / for thow haste ordeynyd & bestowyd vs in the best wise. But for thys cawse we be trowblyd that owre beawte & brightnes is not alwaye shewed. Therfore lorde we mekely beseche
the / to take the lyghte fro th  make hym darke that owre bryghtnes in the  tyme may appere & be shewyd. To whom the lorde & maker answered & sayd your peticion is not lawfull for the sonne is the garnys∣sher of the day / The distrybutour of howrys / the Ory¦gynall of all thynges growynge / and without hym no thyng maye encreace. Therfore I wyllnot condescende to your peticion for it is not exaudible / nor worthy to be alowyd. Wherfore the sterrys seyng they cowlde not haue their desire went ageyn togydre & fourmed a newe peticiō & offeryd it to thier maker & sayd. O blessid lorde & maker of all creatures / we beseche the at least to drye vp & put a waye the clowdis out of the ayre the whiche lette our bryght lyght to be shewyd For ostyntymes for their lettyng. we may not apree / nor be knowyn as we be. And therfore lowly we pray the / that where as our first askyng was denyed vs / of thy godenes grant vs this seconde peticion & desyre. The lorde & maker consi∣deryng their symples / gaue theym this answer with a sad countenance and sayd. Holde your peas & desire not vnlefull thynges / for I wyll not graunt them / for it is wryttyn in the boke of Caton / Aske that is righfull / & that yt semyth honest. ye clowds be necessary though ye thinke contrary For they with their rayn moystē therth If no rayne shulde fall the erth cowde not be frutefull & with this answer he put the sterrys from their desyre and sayde thus in this wyse. That peticion may Iustly be denyed Whiche at no tyme to Reason is applyed. MAn by this example it apereth that he that wyl be herd in his prayers or in his supplicacion / must aske the thinges that be rightfull / honest and resonable to be graunted. Wherfore saynt Austyn sayth / whan ye
aske the thynges whiche god laudeth & promyseth / thē is your askynge sure / for yt peticyō is sone granted of god Therfore Isyder sayth trewe. Many men praynge / be nat herd in theyr askyng. For god granteth them better & more for theyr welth / then they desyre. Seneca telleth in ye ij. booke of benefits / yt a teyn persone on a tyme as∣ked j. d. of Alexāder / & he gaue hym an hole town. And whan the peticyoner thanked alexander & sayd he was nat worthy nor able to receyue so great a gyfte / alexan∣der answered & sayd natto hym. I retayne in my mynde what becōmeth ye to aske / but what becmoth me to gyue So almyghty god doth / for oftentymes he granteth nat our askyng / becawse he wyll auaunce our peticyon with a better / & more profitable rewarde. And therfore sayth Isidor. Som tymes god hereth nat many folkes to their plesure. for he wyll gracyously here them to theyr more profyte and helthe. ¶ Of ye Raynbowe / & a signe called Cancer. Dial .v.
OVr Lordys bowe / after the fyrst Flode apered in the Clowdes hauynge two colours / that was waterye and fyrye. signifyenge the Iugement cōmynge. whiche bowe apered by the space of .xl yeres after the byldynge of the Arke As it is sayde Historie Scolasticall. Cancer is one of the signes of Heuyn / and this worde cancer is Eqniuocum / & hathe many signyficyons / But notwihstandyng / here it betokeneth the signe of Heuyn And so this signe Canrer went vnto the Raynbowe in a gret anger and sayde. Thou art to bolde / for all heuyn is lytel ynough for the / in so moche that thou besyest the to lette me of my course / & other sterrys that sholde occu¦py there. Wherfore I aduyse the to be remouyd lightly or ellys thou shalt be surely coryed of me & my company The bowe answered & sayd. Brother thou spekest nat well / for I am nat about to let ye of thy way / for I shew my selfe but in the day tyme / & thou in the nyght rōnest where plesith the. Wherfore me thīketh yf thou entend to fyght with me / thou art euyll aduysed for this cawse / For thou mayst gader great company of sterrys to hold with the. And I haue frendys ynow / both clowdes and also great thonders for to fyghte agaynst the for all thy strength / and so there may growe great myschefe. But I wyll cownsell the for the best / that  goo before a rightwys Iuge that he may termyn thy questyon by a diffinytyf sentence / and let the fawte be punysshed there as it is / wherto cancer agreed. & whan they bothe were before ye presence of the Iuge / and had shewyd there vn∣to hym theyr mater / The Iuge spake than & sayd thus. Thou wycked Cancer / it is ageynst the lawe or reason all ye prehemynence yt thou askest & desyrest of the bowe.
If thou haue thy wyll and walkynge in ye nyght tyme / and the bow but only in the day tym / how may it be cre¦dyble that he letteth thy waye. Therfore this is my sē∣tence ageyn the. ¶ I wyll and charge the that thou ne¦uer apere in the day tyme. And I condemne the in all ex¦pencys & costys of the courte. Cancer herynge this sen∣tence / was greatly ashamyd and sayd. A besy man / that is full of questyon. Cawseth to hym selfe / oft great confusyon. MAny one in lyke wyse ageynst Lawe and Reason somtyme wyll stryue and fall at alteracy on with out occasyon / and be full of questyons. wherfore they be takyn for wrāgelers and euyll people / and often tymes they be iuged to the worst. Of suche it is written. Pro∣uerbi .xvi. A wrayward man cawseth stryues. And a man full of wordys / ouercōmeth pryncis. The euyll mā euer seketh debate. The bad angell & cruell / is sent ageynst hym / Truly thrugh questyōs & stryues / many one be brought to nought. as Isider sayth / as loue & cō¦corde is alway by loynge / so stryfe & debate / is euermore destroynge. Bede sayth. By discorde the gretest thīges may be distroyed. ¶ There was somtym an honest mā that had thre sōnes / whiche when he sholde dye / he cal∣led them before hym & sayd. Fet me a gret many of wā∣dys bownde togyder / and so they dyd. And whan they were brought he sayd to his children / folde them & breke them. But they cowde nat they were so styf. To whom the fader sayd ageyn / plucke out one of them & breke all the other. And they assayed to do so. And they myght well bowe them / but they cowd nat breke them. ¶ The thirde tyme the fader spake and sayde to them / take one alone and asay to breke that / whiche they sone destroyd and brake a sonder. Then sayd he to them in this wyse /
Chyldren / thus shall yt fall vnto you / If that ye do con¦tynewe togyder in loue and concorde / no man shall be a∣ble lightly to hurte nor distroye you. But yf ye varye & be deuyded by dyscorde Euery man shall preuayll esely ageynst you / and distroy you / & put you vnder fote / and therfore beware of malyce and discorde. ¶ Of Heuyn and of Erthe. Dialogo .vi. OF dyuers Philosofers ye sayng is / that the erth is ye myddell parte of ye worlde The conseruer of frutis. The couerige of hell. The noryssher of all quycke thī¦ges. The moder of all growynge thin∣ges / The conuatrice of lyfe / and the swalower of all thynges. ¶ Vpon a tyme Heuyn sent downe to the Erth here many gret tempestys / of rayn / of thonder / & of lyghtenynge. wherby he greuyd ye erth
very sore. when she was angry and gretly displesed she called the ayre to her & sayd / brother ayre I pray the me dyll nat betwene heuyn & me For myne entent is vtter∣ly fiyced to ouerthrowe hym / for he hathe done gret wrō¦ge and iniury vnto me / that I hope to be auenged vpon hym with suche wayes as I can fynde. To whome the ayre answered & sayde. Do not so suster / but let thy wra the passe For though it be so that heuyn haue greued the now / another tyme ye shall be frendys & make mery to∣gyder. The erthe beynge blynde & ouercom with anger wolde nat cese / but ran & caught harneys and began to fyght with heuyn. That seynge ye ayre raysed vp great darknes / & brought forth gret clowdes / & cawsed so gret thyknes / that the erthe cowde nat discerne where heuyn was. And yt contynewed so longe / tyll the wrathe & wod¦nes was clene gone. Than after that the ayre sent out wyndes & purged the contrey / & droue away the mystes & darknessys / & made all clere and sayde. Of Ire and malyce / to do out the flame / we be all bownde / and nat norysshe the same. EVery man ought so to do whan he seyth his frēdis & neyghbours wrothe togider. For after the saynge of Caton / Ire & wrathe letteth the mynde that it may nat discerne truthe. For a man that is angry is past his mynde / & therfore he is to be temperatly gyded & refray∣ned by his frendys tyll he be remoued from that wode∣nes / & tyll wrathe in hym be endyd. For Seneca sayth. The beginynge of wysdom is to moderate Ire & wrath for he that ouercōmeth wrathe / doth ouercome his grea∣test ennemy / as Valeri telleth whan Archita tarencius was greuyd with his seruāt he sayd vnto hym. O thou vnhappy creture now wolde I corect the / yf I were nat at this tyme wrothe with the. Wherby it apperet that
Ire and malyce is to be voyded out of the mynde. For as it is sayde in the booke of prouerbis .xxvij. Ire hathe no mercy. Therfore a Iuge ought neuer to geue Sentence whyle he is angry. Wherfore it is redde in Histories of Romayns that Theodosius the Emperour was oftyn∣tymes prompt and dysposed to do cruell execucyon. But there was a wyse man yt gaue hym cownsell that whan he felt hym selfe greuyd and angry / or euer he gaue any sentence he sholde say and reherse softly within himself xxiij. letters of the .a.b.c. that his mynde myght be refresshed / and so to muse what was best to be done. and that he myght the more rypely se & knowe what Iuge∣ment ought rightwisly to be gyuen with gode discrecy∣on and deliberacyon. ¶ Of the ayre / and the wynde. Dailogo .vij.
KNowe ye as the Philosofre sayth / that Ayre is the Spiracle of all thynges liuynge with∣out whome all thynge is sone choked / and dy¦eth that is liuynge. The wynde also is ye dry¦er of the erthe / the mouer of watres / & trow∣bler of the Ayre. And becawse he is trowbler of the ayre / the ayre cawsed hym to be Cited before the highe Iuge and maker of al thinges & sayd. O myghty lorde and maker of all thynge / Loke vpon me I beseche the & haue mercy vpon me. Thou hast ordeyned me suf∣ficyently / and indewyd me with great priuylege. wher∣fore I gyue lawde and thanke vnto the. For thou haste made me to be lyfe of all thynges / But for thys cawse. I am gretly trowbled and vexed with the wynde / For he euer maketh me colde and cawseth me to be vntem{per}ate Therfore I saye to hym / yf euer from hensforth he pre∣sume to blowe vpon me / I wyll choke hym & put hym from his lyfe. To whom the maker answered and sayd / Ayre thou spekest nat well / Though the wynde make the colde and bete the with his blast / Neuerthelesse he yeldeth the purged and temperat / If it so were that the wynde blewe nat on the / thou sholdest be seke & corrupte bothe tedyous and hatefull to euery man. wherfor thou oughtest to loue hym yt conueth the in good estate / and so the ayre was pleased and sayd. Correctours that correct vs for our owne good we ought to loue / & to suffre with a glad mood. SO euery Creature ought to loue them that corect them & sheweth thē theyr fawts & entēde toreduce them to goodnes and to ye way of truthe / For truly the seke man that denyeth to drynke the bytter drinke that his leche gyueth hym wyll nat suffre hym selfe to be cu¦red / and so he shall neuer be delyuered from his sebenes. And he that
hatyth his corectoure / shal not be weldyrected Verelye a man louith not his leche / whan he wil not suf¦fre hym that rebukyth hym for his goode. But trewe it is that Chrisostome saith. He shal haue hatrede that repreueth the synfull. And Seneca sayth. He sekyth a blame to hym self / that rebukith the wycked man. Su∣che be not wisemen. but rather they be folys / as saith Ec¦clesiastes. A wyseman louyth to be rebukyd / but a fole is wrothe if he be corecte. Therfore corecte a wyseman and he shal loue the. Prouerb .ix. Hitte is wryttyn in the lyfe of saynte Ambrose / that whan Theodosius the Emperowr had punyshed dyuers and dwellers of that contrey withowte delyberation and iugement. Ambro∣se the Archebisshope of mylene expulsyd hym owte of ye chirche / although he was a very Christen Emperowr And whan the Emperowre knewe itte / he sayd to Am∣brose. Dauid comyttyd both adulterye and manslaugh¦ter. And Ambrose answerde. If thow hast folowyd hym in his errowre / folowe also the penaunce of hym. The Emperowre that herynge / was verye contryte inwar∣delye and dyd greate penaunce and sayde. I haue foun∣de a man of trowth Ambrose the Bysshope. And so the Emperowr ordeyned that nomanshulde be iugid to deth withowte .xl. days of respyghte / that Ire myght be swa¦gyd and the mynde myght be the more clere that right∣wysnes myght be sene in geuynge of iugemente. ¶ Of the see bankys and the see Dialogo .viij.
THe see is the halser of the worlde / the well of al showrys / and the lodginge place of all floodys as the Philosofre sayth. For as it is wryttyn Ecclesia stici primo. Al floodes entre the see and he yeldith them not agayn. And the flodes re∣tourne to the place that they cam fro / that they shulde slowe agayne. This see is greate and large as it is wry¦tyn in the Psalme .ciij. And so the see by his magnificen∣ce and greate power went to the bankys and sayde. I meruayle greatly of thy hardnes and of thy styf harte. Thowe arte euyr contrary to me and with stondist me and lettyst me that I maye not ete the erthe and consu∣me it as I wold doo. Wherfore I desire the to be remo∣uyd fro thy place / that I maye preuayle agayne the er∣the and put hym vnderfote or ellys. I shall notte cese to warre on the and put the to greate trowble. To whom the banke answerd and sayd. It is euyll sayd brodir. For the maker of all thinge hath ordeyned me so / and I suf∣fre great labour infrayning the for ye obedience yt I owe
to hym. Thou comyst vppon me oftyn tymes & puttist me to great gref. I bere ye & suffre ye pacyently for ye loue of god / therfore thowe owyst not to multiplye vnkynde wordis agayn me for I may not change my place. This hering ye see answerd in great wodenes / & thou mayst suf¦fre thā / suffre styl for I shal neuir let ye to be ī peace. but I shal bete & punysh ye with al my powr. The bāk paci∣tly put hi self vndir yt yocke of obedience. & sayde thus. Godemen may both Chyde and fyghte. And punysh them that doth not ryghte. EVery prelate & rular owith to be manlye & resiste them that be synfull yt thei preuayle not. Neuerthe¦lesse Gregory saith. As ye see euir rebellyth & repugnith agayn ye bankys by whome it is refraynyd & kept In ly¦kewyse some personys in relygion euir rebell again ther prelatis. which can not coarte them nor bringe them to godenes. But good shepeherdis nede not to drede ye mali¦cyous thretyngis of thē yt be badde. But rathr lyke as a wakyng shepeherdeis wonte to kepe his shepe frō crel beastis / so good curatisowe to be diligent to cōsrue ther flocke frō peryshing. Therfor saith Isidir. Euill shepe∣herdis take no hede of ther shepe. but as it is rede in the Euangely of thē yt be but hyrid men which take no gret charge of ye flocke / for & if they see ye wolf cominge anone they flee. Whē fle they away. Certainly whan they be styll & dare not speke befor thē yt be myghty & of powr / & whan thei be tymerous & fereful to with stonde thē yt be synful & euyl disposyd. Therfor Iherom comfortith vs & sayth / let vs intend to please god / & as for ye thretinge of man / we shal not nede to care. Petrus Comest or tellith yt ther was a kyng of Macedone callyd philippe / & he be segid a cite callyd Athenis / & at last he spake to thē of ye cite & sayd. Delyuer me .x. oratours such as I shal chese emōg you / & Ishal be cdfedrid with yowe / & go my waye
The moste wise Creature callyd demostenes answe∣red to the kynge and sayde. wolues on a tyme spake to the shepheerdis and sayde. All the discorde betwene yow and vs cawseth yowr doggis yf ye entende to be at one with vs / delyuer vs yor dogs and we shal be frdndys for euyr. And whan they had so done / The woluys at ther owne wyll deuowryd the shepe. Be the which ex∣ample hitte aperyth howe greate perell hitte is whan doggis by whome is vndirstonde prechowrs and Cu∣ratis forsake ther flockys and be negligent to barke and preche agayne synne. For as softnes is laudable in ma∣ner and ire is reprouable / so is it contrarye in a dogge. For a softe dogge is not goode / but rathir more to be che∣risshed for his fiersnes in tyme nedefull. And so discreate fiersnes is comendable in hym that hath cure and char∣ge of sowlys &c. ¶ Of Fyre and watyr Dialogo .ix.
THe fire is lyghte. Pure. Subtyll. Moneable. Bryght and warm. And for it is soo precyous he conceyuyd a pryde and sublymacyon in hym self and sayde. I preuayle in the erthe vppon all othir thing & consume all thing. but & I myght preuayle in the watyr / than shuld I be exaltyd myghty¦ly aboue all thinge / and for this cawse he callyd the wa¦tyr to hym and sayde. Moste dere suster I knowe wel yt thou arte an elemente of goddis as I am. Wherfore if I were dwellinge with the and conioyned to the I shulde apere the gretter & of more excellencie. Wherfore I pray the suffir me to dwell with the and to reioyce in the. The watyr subtelly began to make symulacyon & sayde Longe haue I desyryd to be at this rest with the. Come to me surely and I shal auaunce the bettyr to my power This herynge the fire was mery and iocunde and fren∣dely entryd in to the watyr. The watyr sayde whyl she had the fire within her to them that stode beside. Thys is myn enymy and contrary of my kynde. He hath oftyn tymes consumyd me and brought me to nought. Now I maye be vengyd and destroy hym yf me lyste. But aftir the counsell of the Apostle. I will not do oon shrewyd turn for an othyr. And also the worlde shal not lese so ne¦cessary a thinge be the meanys of me / Neuerthelesse som what I wyll abate hys pryde and make hym lower. and thus saynge the watyr began to gadre her self togidyr and to pisse in the fire. And a none the fire began to spe∣ke fayre and prayde the watyr to destroye hym notte vt¦terlye. The watyr was mercyfull to the fire and did not put hym owt clene. butte conueyde hym to the erth and sayde in this maner▪ Goddis pleasure he doth fulfyll That yeldith a goode turn for an yll.
NOw it is so that manyon doth contrary / and doth one shrewyd turn for an othir / & be wylfull to take vengeaunce and wyll not forgyue offencis done to them wherfore Ierome sayth. As god hath forgyuen owr syn¦nes in Christe / so we muste forgyue them that offende vs / and so the folowynge of the exāple of god / reuokith and brekith the iniurye done to vs / consyderinge yt criste paciently suffirde and forgaue. So we must be sufferable in aduersyte / and mekely forgyue owr aduersaryes as it is rede in the historys of Alexandre. wher it is shewid yt a sertayne person had so greuously offendyd Alexander that he wold not forgeue hym. Aristotle that knowing went to Alexander and sayde my lorde I will that thys daye thow salt be more victoryous then euir thow were Alexandyr answered and sayde. I wyl. Then sayde Ari¦stotle. Thow haste subduyd all the kyngdomys of the worlde / but now this daye thou arte ouercome. For and thou be not ruler of thy self then arte thou rulyd. And if thou rule thi self than arte thou victorious / for he that ouercomith hym self is most stronge as saith the philo∣sofre. Alexandre herynge this saynge of Aristotle. Re∣myttyd the offence done and was pleasid. Wherfore it is wryttyn Prouerb .xvi. Bettyr is a pacyent man / than a stronge man. And he that hath domynacyon ouir him self then a geter of citees &c. ¶ Of the watyr and the Fyre. Dialogo .x. BRothir sayd the water vnto the Fyre. Why be we twayn alway contrary and enymyes. Gode it is for vs to kepe goddis Comaun∣dmentis that saith. Thou shalt loue the ney¦boure as thy self. Mat .xxij. For fulfyllinge
of the lawe is loue as saith ye Apostle ad Rom .xiij. To whom the Fyre answerd saynge. It plesith me wel that thou spekist for the same Apostle wytnessith in the same Chapiter. That loue of neybour is profytable and doth neuir harm. wherfor let vs go and make owr dwellyng togider. And whan they were dwellynge togider they cowde neuir accorde / for the Fire made the watyr hote & consumyd her. The watyr oftyntymes qwenchid ye fire wherfore they continuyd euyr in contencyon and discord For the which cawse they departyd asonder and sayde. It wyll not be at one worde. That tway contraryes shuld kyndely acorde. ONe that is of good disposicion owith not to dwell with hym that is badde / which is to hym contra∣ry for lyghtly he may lese his godenes / & his good name & all his good operacyon & workyng / for cause of his euil companye / as a philosofre saith. Chese thou good folke and meke that thowe mayste lyue and be goode / For it is wryttyn Psalmo .xvii. wyth a goode man thowe
shalte be goode / and with a wrayward man thow shalt be lyke hym. The apostill consyderinge that it is perilo{us} to lede the lyfe with bad people. wrote ad Thessalo .iiij. saynge. Bredryn we shewe vnto yow in the name of out lorde Iesu Christe / that ye withdrawe yowre self from the compeny of euery brodir that walkith inordynatlye for Isidir sayth. Hitte is perylous to lede owre lyfe with them that be knowyn bad and synfull / and hit is dought full to be associate vnto them that be of bad mynde. A fa¦ble is tolde that heuyn sent dowu faire watyr to wasshe the erthe / and whan this watyr shulde haue bene lod∣gid all nyght with a colier she sayd vnto hym. Brodyr we maye not dwell togithyr / for all that euyr I may clen¦se and make clene in the longe daye tyme / thowe mayst spotte it with blaknes in an owre. So lyke wyse all that euyr a wiseman or a godeman getyth in longe season / a sole or a bad man may destroye in an owre. Of the floode and the see. Dialogo .xi.
AS the Philosofre sayth ye floode ys a continuall rynnyng / a refresshynge of the sonne and moystre of the erth / and at a tyme of oportunite / the flode wēt to the see that is callyd Mare in laten and sayde to hym. Thowe arte ryght¦fully callyd mare / yt is bytternes / for thow contynuyst euir in great bitternes. Is not thy bit¦ternes great and thyn vnkyndenes moche more / whan thow continually drinkest of my swetnes and thou euir gyuest to me agayne nothinge but bytternes. The see answered and sayd. Gold and syluer haue I none. Such as I haue of the beste and of the inwarde partye of my body I gyue vnto the as to my feythfull frende. Ther∣fore thow owyst paciently to suffir my bytternesse for & yf thow loke & consydre wel / therof is deryuyd thy most grete swetnesse and thy incomparable goodnesse. This hearinge the floode / was all pleasyd and sayd. Who that desyryth the swete to Assaye He muste taste byttyr this is no Naye. Lykewyse it behouithe euery man to suffyr the bit∣tyr scourge of trybulacyon that desireth to haue the swetnes of euerlasting cōsolation as Gregory saith Tribulacion is the gate of the kyngdom of heuyn. The psalter witnessith the same, cxvij. where it is thus writ¦tyn / This is the gate of owre lorde. Rightfull men shal entyr by it. It is also redde. Actu .xiiij. Be many tribula¦cions it behouith vs to entre in to the kyngdome of he∣uyn. But many on may be lyknyd to an Ape / the which clymyth into a tre of nottys / and whan she tastithe the owte parte that is byttyr / she castith awaye all ye Rem∣naunte or she come to the Cornell / and therfore she ta∣styth neuyr of the swetnes of the Notte. So many vn∣wyse
folkys cast awaye Tribulacion lightly as sone a euyr they fele itte / and therfore of the swetnes of the he∣uynly rewarde whiche shall be geuyn to them that pa∣cyently suffyr tribulacyon they shal neuyr taste. As a sertayn abbotte sayde whan he was blynde. I gyue thā kinge to my lorde God / that hath wrokyn me on myne enymye. Which were wonde to do me so moche hurte / that were to me lyke theuys and traytowres / whiche wold haue destroyd me. I meane my wanton eyn twayn But godde of his grace hath now destroyed them. An o∣thyr Relygyous man made greate ioye / whan he had loste oon of his eyn / and othir folkis made greate sorow for hym And he askyd of them for which of his eyen thi made that heuynes / and they sayde for that that was owte. And he answerde and sayd to them. He that hath tway enymyes / if one be destroyed the othyr is to be drad and not he that is goon redye. Wherfore Iherome saith and wrytyth to a sertayn persone. Sorowe thowe notte nor mourne though thowe haue not that flyes and ser∣pentis haue. For we haue sene and knowyn dyuers phi∣losofirs that haue wylfully put owte ther eyen. Inten∣dynge to kepe ther myndys the bettyr inwardlye and to eschewe vanyteys which growe be occasion of the eyen / and therfore some payne muste be suffirde of hym that desireth euerlastinge reste. ¶ Of the Hyll and the Valey Dialogo .xii.
A Vale lay low in a sertayne place ha∣uynge to her ioyned an hyghe mown∣te which kepte the vale in subieccion / At laste this vale grutchid and was sore vexyd with impacyēce / and brak owte and multyplyed greate wordis agayne the hyll / and sayde euyn thus to hym. Thow wycked and Comberows caytyf why greuyst thow me so longe and neuyr secyste. Cece trow∣belous wretche of the greate greef that thou doyst to me & change thy place for thou hast long kept me vndir / & yf thou wilt not I shalbe vengid on the. To whom the hyll answerd & sayd. Thy complaynt cannot be refour¦med as yet For our maker hath erect me / & set me aboue for the beginning / & he hath ordeynd ye to be benethe and vndir Therfor be paciēt & suffir to ye last day of iugemēt & than shal mowntes & hylles be made law / as wrytith Isaye .xl. But the vale toke none hede of al this / but in greate hastynes brought with her treys & herbys / & be∣gan batell agayn ye hyll / & woundid hym sore with shot of arowys & dartys. The hyll seynge yt / began to waxe woode with yt vale & sayde. Of thyn own dedys I iuge
the thow shewid seruaunte / for thow arte not ashamyd to begyn batell agayne thy soueraigne and thy bettyr. And thus saynge the mownte threwe downe stonys ād all to knockyd the vale and stoppid the wayes that she myght not flye nor none of her Companye. And so the vale was humilyate subduyd and brought vndir with correction and sayde. Seruauntis be bownde at all tymes to obaye. To ther souereygnes and not to saye Naye. MAnyon impacyent repugne agayne ther bettyrs. Wherfore they owe to be holde vndyr the yocke of seruyce / For it is wryttyn Eccles .xxiiij. Mete correctyō and burdone longith to an asse / and lernyge with labou¦re to a seruaunte. While he workyth with correccyon he sekyth reste. Relece hym and he sechyth lyberte. To an Iuylwyllyd seruaunte longith Correccyn and fettyrs. Sende hym to his worke that he be not Idyll / sette hym in besynes / for that becomyth hym beste. A sertayne lor¦de somtyme had a wraywarde seruaunte and Iuylwyl¦lyd whiche whan he was Idle he Rebellyde withe his wordis agayne his lorde. Wherfore his Lorde bete hym myghtyly and kepte hym frome delycyows metys and drynkes and putte hym to greate labowre / and so with werynes and labowre he was ouercome and fayne to a∣mende / and brydle his tonge frome suche vncurteys lan¦gage. Wherfore it is wryttyn. Prouerbio .xxix. He that dilycatly nourrisshth his seruaunte in his yowth and bryngeth hym so vppe / aftyrwarde he shal fynde hym rebell agayn hym / and therfore dewe correccyon is to be had. ¶ Of Gemmys and precyous Stonys. Dialogo xiij.
PRecyous stonys and Gemmis came altogidyr and sayde. we be deerest and best be louyd to people aboue all othyr thinge. But and yf we be fownde esy∣lye in euery place. we shal be abiecte ād lytyll pryce sette bye. wherfore let vs go hyde vs in farre contrays that we lyghtly maye not be founde / withoute greate labowre and coste. For that thynge that is dere boughte and withe greate pryce is moche sette bye / and surely kepte. Therfor we wyll not be moche sene. Nor dayly apere to euery mannys syght for it is not most profytable vnto vs aftyr this prouerbe that sayth. They that wyll precyows thynges haue & fynde. Must plye them to laboure both body and mynde. SO the seruaunte of Cryste that couetyth and desy¦reth to be replete and fulfylled with precyous ver∣tays
must aplye hym besy lye to exercyse hī self in goost¦ly labowre / and be neuir Idyl. For idelnes is enymye to the sowle as it is rede in Vitis pa. There was but one fende aboughte to tempte a monke that was Idle. and a. M. abought an othir that was occupyed. Therfore Ierome sayth. Do euyr some goode dede that the deuyll may fynde the occupyed. A man wele occupyed is lyke vnto a Castell that is surely closyd / to the which none enymye may be noyable / and saynte Augustyn sayth. He is not esily deceyuid of the fynde that besylye inten∣dith to goode occupacion. Wherfore fadirs and modirs owith to meue and stere ther yonge Chyldryn to occu∣pation and labowre / that they fayle not of ther lyuynge be the meanys of slowth. As ther was somtyme a wyse husbondman / that set a vyne / and whan he shuld dye / he tolde his chldryn that he had hid greate treasoure in ye vyneyerd / but he shewid thē not in what place he had hid it / aftir his dethe his childern began to delue and to dygge / in ye vyneyerde to fynde the tresowre / & of that la∣bowre the vyneyerde was very frutefull and broughte for the frute in the most plentyuous wyse / and so the chil¦dren perceyuyd wel the meanyge of ther fadir / be the tre¦sowre hyd in the vyneyerde was no more to meane / but that the more they labowryd in the vyneyerde / the mo∣re profyght shuld they haue. And they dyd so & were cō∣tynually besy whan they had oportunyte & laysar. Also ther was a philosofre that tawght his sone and sayde. Sone loke yt the antte be not found wiser than thou the which gadryth in the somer somoch and with so besy la∣boure that she is therby mayteynyd al the longe wynter Let not the cok be waker or stronger than thow / which duly obseruith and kepith his matutynall owrys / and chastisith hym self with betynge excitynge and steryng othir be his goode example to doo the same. And who is
so stronge that hath so many wyllys as the Cok hath / and kepith them all Chaste and in obedience to hym as he doth / and thow sayst thou canste not subdue one wy to the. ¶ Of the Smaragde and the Rynge. Dialogo .xiiij. SMaragdus is a stone as sayth brito / to the which ther is no thynge may be lykenyd of more grenenesse. For why he transcendith in colowre of grene both herbis and bowys / & fillyth the Ien but satisfieth thē not as saith papie. A ryng of golde bare in hym a precyo{us} Smaragde a greate whyle / wherof the colowre was so plesawnte / that many one cam out of ferre contrays withe greate desire to beholde hitte. Vppon a daye the Rynge spake vncurteyslye to the Smaragde and sayde Thowe haste long contynued / and dwellyde in my sta¦cyon / and neuyr paydest me / for thy stondynge.
wherfore delyuer thy dewlye for thyn habitacyon / and goo thy waye. Or I shall take from the all that thowe haste / and putte the owte of thy lodgynge. To whome the Smaragde sayde. If I haue longe continuyd & dwel¦lyd with the. It hath rebowndid to thy worshyppe. For by me thou hast be take in great reputacion and worshy¦pe. For I haue cawsyd the to be honorably exaltyd and to be put on the kyngis fynger / and yf thou wyltenedis expell me / make no delay but sell me / and of my great va¦lowre take thy dewtye for my howserent. For I can not lacke of habytacyon. And whan the rynge had expellyd this precyows stone and dischargid hym of hys hows. The rynge hym self apperyd but bare and abiecte and was not take in reputacyon of any man. and at the last be repentyd hym sore and sayde. Example ys shewyd by the stone and the Rynge. That it is vyle to be partyd frō a worthy thinge. THe seruaunte of Criste is worshypfull in lykewy¦se / as longe as he retaynyth and kepith precyows vertewys with in hym. And if he caste them from him he is to be cast awaye / as Seneca sayth. A good man is to be prouyd be hys dedys / and so prouyd owyth to be ta¦kyn. Vppon a tyme whan greate Alexander callyd him self lorde of all the worlde. Diogenes the phylolofer an¦swered to hym and sayd. Not so for thowe arte no Lorde / but seruaunte of one of my seruauntis. For pryde is thy lady and my seruaunte. For she rulyth the and I haue destroyed her. Flesshly luste. Glotonye and Ire be thy ladyes and my seruauntis / for they lede the and haue do mynacyon ouir the. I haue ouercome them and put thez vnder fote / and therfore verylye thow arte but a seruan¦te of one of my seruauntis. And whan the seruauntis of Alexander that harde this / wolde haue fall vppon ye
Philosofre and haue betyn hym. Alexander chargyd Nay and sayde. Not so hardy any man to towche hym vyolentlye / for he is full trewe and goode and reportith euyn as hit is. Also Gregorye saythe. Man is made of greate dignite and worshyppe if he kepe hym self as he is bownde to doo withowte vycyowsnes / and that is a perfyghte tokyn of greate manhode in hym and of great vertewe & ce. ¶ Of the Saphyre and of the Goldesinyth.

EThymologiarum .xvi. saith Isydore / that Saphirus is a precyous stone / lyke vnto the Firmamente whan it is clere / whiche geuith a brynnyge lyghte whan he is smy¦tyn with the sonne beamis. There was sometyme a connynge goldesmyth whiche
was an excellent workman of that most honourable oc∣cupacyon / which disposyd to sette this precyous saphyre In the Emperowris Dyademe. That seynge the Sa∣phire / sayde vnto the Goldesmyth. Good Mastir in∣close me notte. For I am atte lyberte and yonge and apt to the worlde. Therfore I wyll not be separate and de∣partyd from the iocundyte of the worlde. But I wyll be mery a whyle and se the compasse of hitte. To whome this noble workman sayde. Thyn inclusion shall be thy holynesse and for thy greate auayle / For I shal sette the in a sure place where thow shalt lyue in suretye withe owte drede / For I consydre well thy precyosite and thy greate valowre / and I drede that and if thowe wandyr abought the worlde thow shalt be loste / for it is wryten primo Iohannis quinto. All the worlde is sette in maly¦cyousnes. Ther be so many perylles in this worlde that neythyr the tong of man can expresse them / nor yet the harte thynke them. Wherof Gregory wryteth & sayth We owe euyr to drede / for we be in continuall perell. and for this cawse myn own dere sonne / and for the greate loue and fauowre I owe to the / I wyll not suffre the to go fro me / nor to wandre aboughte the worlde. But I wyll putte the in sure conseruacyon and kepynge / and aftyr this saynge this reuerende workman and Gold∣smyth inclosyd the Saphyr worshipfully in the kyngis Dyademe. Where he continuyd perpetually in greate worshype and sayde. In sure place is bettyr to abyde. Than to wandre abought / and be without gyde SO it is sure to a Relygyows man to continewe & abyde in his cloystre and in his Cell. For it is wry∣ten in vitis pa. Go in to thy Cell thowe man of Rely∣gyon / and it shall teche the all thinges necessary to thy
wele. For ther regnyth peace in the Cell / and withowt is awaye of batell & stryf. And therfore as Ierome saith he that desire the Cryste / let hym seke nothinge ellys in this worlde / but let his Cell be to hym as paradyce ful¦fylled with swetnes of holy scripture / and that vse ofte¦ns for delycis / and reioyce in the stodye of them. An abbotte callyd euagarius sayde vnto one that sayde to hym / as it is redde in vitis pa. I maye notte faste / nor laboure nor wayte vpon seke folke. Go ete quod the ab¦botte / drynke and slepe / but kepe styll thy cell and come notte owte / for perseueraunce in the cell / ledith a monke to his ordre / and so lytyl and lytyll he retournyd agayn to the holy workys of perfeccyon. ¶ Of the precyous Topasyon Dialogo, xvj.
TOpasiue as saith Papie is a precyous Gemme Which in hym self beryth the colowris of alma¦ner of precyous stonys. Isidore also sayth ethy∣mo. libro .xvi. that it is a stone grene of kynde shynyng with almaner of Colowr which was first founde in an Ile of Arabye that is Callyd Topazi & therof the stone is namyd Topazius. Vppon a tyme a precyows Topasyon / was conueyde and Caried owt of Arabye vnto Rome and reuerently sette & consecrate in a crosse in the Chirche of saynt Petyr of Rome & there it was desyrouslye beholde / of many a creature. This Topasyon was infecte with bad counsell and saxde. What lyf is this to continewe alway in the Chirche & neuyr to departe thens. Nor at no tyme to be famy∣lier with the worlde. Wherfore I wyll for a season / re∣tourn to the worlde that I may haue a lytel recreacyon in it and emery with secularis / and aftir to regne with Criste in heuyn. And whan he was departyd from that holy place & tournyd to the worlde agayn he was takyn and deceyued be vnleful concupiscencis of the worlde & so put hym self to the daunger of allmaner of vicis / and fell in to the hondis of hethyn peple. And whan they knewe not the worthynes of hym they sette lytell pryce be hym and dispised him & draue him fro the contray / in so moche that he durste neuyr aftyr apere there / and at ye conclusion this Topasion was broke and destroyed and sayde with greate lamentacion and mournynge. He that departith from an holy place Without cause leful shal somtym fayle of grace THerfore Relygyous folkys owith to be ware to re¦tourn to the worlde that they prrish not with the worlde. For truly concupiscens destroyth relygyous fol¦kys. And therfore saynt augustyn sayth. As the loue
of God is the well of all vertue. So is the loue of the worlde well of all vicis. Wherfor he that wylhaue god in possession muste forsake the worlde that God may be to hym a blessyd possession for euyr. Barnard also saith. The perfight seruaunt of Criste louyth nothynge but him. And if he loue any thinge saue him he is notte per∣fighte. Also Barnarde saith. They that be made ryche with lpirituall goodis / owe not to be implyed to secular occupacions. It is rede in vitis patrum / that a sertayne brodir of Relygyon askyd an olde man a questyon & sayd What shal I do for my thought wyll not suffir me to a∣byde oon howre in my cell. And the oldeman answerde & sayde. Sone turn agayne and sitte styll in thicell / and la¦boure with thy hondis / and praye God besylye / & caste vppe thy thought to hym / and beware that no man de∣ceyue the nor cawse the to departe fro thy Cell / For I shal tell the a meruelous tale. There was a yongman somtyme that was secular and had his fader lyuynge / & so this yongman had a greate desire to be a monke. And at a tyme of oportunite and laysar he prayde his fadir to graunte hym his goode wyll / that he might receyue the holy ordre and his fader wolde not graunte hym. And aftyrwarde this yongman cawsid his kynrede and fren¦dis to make greate instaunce to his fadir / and at laste be ther meanys his fadir suffirde him to acomplish his ape¦tyte / & to entre in to Relygyon howe be it his fadir was not greatly pleasid with all. And forthwith immediatly this yongman went to a monasterye / and was made a monke. And whan he had receyuid the holye habyte of Religion he began in greate perfeccion Dewly to per∣fourme all the charges of the monastery and vsid great fastinge dayly. And aftirwarde he vsyd fastynge be .ii. dayes and .iii. dayes / and onys in the weke to take sufte∣naunce
/ his abbotte seynge his perfeccyon had meray∣le and thankyd God of his vertewe and goostely tra∣uayle. Aftyr a season it happid this yonge monke made supplycacyon to his abbotte and sayde. I praye the fadir to lycence me to goo in to wyldernes. And the abbotte answerde and sayde. Sone thinke not ther one for thow mayst not suffre so greate laboure / nor so greate tempta¦cyons of the fende and subtyltyes of hym ther. And if it happyn the to fall in temptacyon thowe shalt fynde no man ther to gyue the goode counsell / for to preserue the fro the trowble of thyn enymye / that he wyll put to the This monke encrecyd his peticyon and prayde his abbot to lycence hym to departe. The abbotte seynge that he wold departe / and that he cowde not kepe hym / gaue hī good counsell and prayde deuowtely for him and let him goo. But he also desyred his abbotte to sende some fol∣kys with him to sette hym in his waye / and he ordeyned two monkis of that same monasterye / and they dyrectid hym in his iourney. & as they malkyd a daye or twayne in the wyldernes they were almooste ouercome withe greate heate / and they laye down to reste them / and fell in a slombre / and ther cam an egle and smote them with his wynges and flew fer thens and sette on the ground And they woke and sawe hym / and sayde to the yonge monke. Beholde this is thyn aungell. Ryse and folowe hym. And he rose and toke leue of them and folowyd the egle / and came where she stoode. The whiche streyghte rose and flewe forthe a furlonge thens / and set down a∣gayne. And this monke folowyd her And eft agayne the egle flewe forthe not farre thens and satte downe. And this continuyd be the space of iii howris. And af∣tyrwarde whyll this monke folowyd the egle / she tour∣nyd vppon hys right syde and sodeynly was gone. Ne∣uerthelesse
this brodir folowyd aftyr her and lokyd and espyede .iii. palme treys and a well of fayre watyr / and a caue in the erthe and sayde. This is the place that God hath ordeynede for me / and went in and Taryed ther and ete and toke his sustynaunce of the datis that grewe ther / and drank watyr of the wel and contynuyd ther .vi. yeris space. and sawe neuir creature all that season. And vppon a daye the deuyll Cam thedir to him in lykenes of an olde abbotte hauinge a dredefull loke. And whan this monke sawe hym he was aferde / and lay down prostrate in prayer and rose agayne / and the deuyll spake and sayde to hym. Brodir / lette vs go pray more. And whan they rose / the deuyll sayde vnto hym a∣gayne. Howe longe hast thowe bene here. And he an∣swerde. The Terme of .vi. yerys. Then sayd the fende Thowe hast bene my neybowre a greate while / and I knewe not of thy dwellynge here not paste .iiii. days ∣goon. And I haue a monastery not fer hens / and forsoth this .xiii. yeris came I not owte of it tell nowe this same daye / and that was for cawse I vnderstoode that thow dweldist so nere me. For I Reuoluyd in my mynde and sayde to my self. I wyll go vnto this gode man / and Co∣myn with hym for the wele of my sowle. And therfore brodyr for this entent I am come hyder. Certaynly me thinkith that we prositte but lytyll here syttyng in the∣se Cellis / for we receyue not the blessyd Sacrament / of Cristis holy flessh & bloode / & therfore I drede that we shal be no partyners of it / if we neglygentlye kepe owr self from the percepcyon of so excellent a mysterye / as yt is. But brodir .iii. myle bens is a monasterye & ther is a preste / and by my counsel we will go vppon sonday next or with in this fortnyght at fardest / & we wyll receyue owre lorde and maker / and retourn agayne to owr Cel∣lys. And so this monke thoughte that this Counsell
of the fende was goode / and whan the daye was come that they had prefyxed the deuyll came and sayde. Goo we hens for it is tyme. And forth they went to gither the deuyll & the monk / tell they cam to the monastery wher the preste was / and they entrid into the Chirche there and toke them to theyr prayers. And atte the laste this monke rose vppe and lokyd abought / & coude not fynde hym that brought hym thedyr and sayde to hym self. where is he become. I trowe he begoon to the place of co¦myn necessite. And aftyr whan he had taryed longe / and the othir shrew came not / the monke went owt & sought hym / and whan he cowde not fynde hym / he inquyred for hym of the bredrin of that monasterye / and sayde to them. where is that olde abbotte that came withe me in to yower Chirche. Sawe yowe not of hym lately. And they answerde to hym and sayde. we sawe non to but ye aloone. Then knewe this monke well that it was hys aduersarye the deuyll that had deceyued hym and sayed Nowe I consydyr well that ye deuyll with his sotylteys hath brought me fro my Cell / but it forthinkith me not For I Came for a goode entente / to receyue the holy sa∣crament of Cristis flessh and bloode / and then to goo a∣gayne to my cell. And whan masse was doone the fader and abbotte of that monasterye wold not suffre hym to departe / but sayde to hym. we wyll not let yowe goo tell ye haue dynyd & refresshyd yowr self. whan dyner was done and he was goynge to his cell. The deuyll came a∣gayne in lykenes of a yongman in secular clothyng and behylde this monke intentyflye fro the hede to the fote & sayo with reiteracyō many tymes. This same is he. It is not he. At laste this monke sayde. I trowe thow kno¦wyst me. But how maye yt be / For I haue not bene sene many yeris. The deuyll sayde. I am thy fadirs neybour
the sonne of suche a man / and this is thy fadirs Name. and thy moder is Namyd thus / and thus arte thow na¦myd / and be not these yowr seruauntes namys and thi modir and sustyr be ded .iij. yerys paste / and thy fadir is nowe lately deceside / and hathe made the his ayre and sayde whan he shuld dye. To whome shuld I leue my good / but to myn own sonne that is so vertuows & good and hath forsake the worlde and folowyd thesteppis of godde to hym I leue all my goodis. Nowe if ther be any good man that dredith God and wote wher he is / lette hym tell me / that he may come and departe my goodis to power people for the wele of my sowle and his bothe. And manyon haue gone to seke the and cowde not fynde the / and as my fortune was for an othir cawse I came this waye / and happyd to espye the. Wherfore tary not be my councell but come and sell all thinge and perfour∣me the wyll of thy fadyr. The monke answered & sayde It is not expedient to me to tourne agayne to the world The deuyll answerde agayne and sayde. If thowe com not all thy Fadirs gode shall be loste / and thowe shalt be counteable for it in ye sighte of god. What harm saye I to the. But I shewe the thy fadirs wyll / and I desire the to come and distrybute his goodis lyke a goode my∣nister to them that be indigent and nedy that it be notte consumyd nor my spent / be vnthristes / but that it maye be spent to the consolacyon and releef of suche as be ver¦tuows and in pouerte. Or what greate burdon shall it be to the / to come and do for thy fadirs sowle / withe his owne goodis as his syngler trust was in the / and then torn agayne to thy Cell. What more. The deuyll pre∣uaylyd be his false instigacion / and so this monke wēt forth with hym tell they came togider to the cyte / and ther he forsoke hym. And whan this monke was alone
he wente towarde his fadirs hows / wenynge to haue fownde hym dede. and his fadir was Comynge owte of the durre beynge alyue / and knewe not his sonne / butte askyd what he was / and he was wonderfully troublyd and cowde gyue noone answere. And his fadyr askyde of hym dyuers tymes and many what he was / & whens he came. And at laste he sayde with Rubowre and greate confusyon. I am thy sonne. Then sayde his fadir Why arte thowe come agayn. And he was ashamyd to tell the Circunstaunce of the mater. Butte at the laste thus he sayde to his fadir. The loue of the hath cawsyd me to come hydir for I desyred sore to fee the / and ther he contynuyd and bode styll / and aftyrin a shorte space he comittyd fornycacyon / and othir greate enormyteys and synnes. Wherfore his fadir vexyd hym / with dyuers af flyceyons. But notwithstondinge he amendid not his lyuynge nor toke no repentaunce / but lyke an vnhappy creature. Contynuyd styll in the worlde / and endid hys lyfe synfullye. Wherfore bredryn I saye that a monke shuld neuer departe frome his cell for no bad counsel &c.
¶Of the Charboncle and the Glasse. Dialogo .xvii. CArbunculus is a precyows stone / as sayth brito / and so namyd for it is brin∣nyge lyk a Cole offyre / and the bright¦nes of hitte shewith in the nyght tyme Hitte shynythe in derknesse so greatly that the flamys of hitte smytythe the¦iye sight. A myrowre of Glasse went to this Charbon∣cle vppon a tyme and sayde. Brodir amonge all othyr precyows stonys / thowe arte very precyous and splen∣dent / and I also bere a bright colowre / so that in me all thinge is clerely sene and consyderid. wherfore as me thinketh if we twayne were oon. we shuld be of more ex¦cellence / and seuyn tymes of more valowre then we be. To whom this Charboncle answerde and sayde thus / I wyll not consent to thy mocyon. For I consydre wele that thowe comyste of a frayle stocke / that is to saye of brotyll Glasse / & myn orygynall growith of precy{us} gē∣mis. Therfore owre coniunctyon is not conuenyent / for Isidore sayth. The Chylde is oftyntymes lyke vnto ye moder. And for thow art not equyualent vnto my sub∣staunce / goo fro me. For I wyll notte be assocyate nor I wyll not be conioynyde vnto the. And moreouer he sayde. This is at all tymes conuenyent and goode. Gentyls to be gydyd aftyr their bloode. SO a Crystyn man / which is of the most noble kyn¦de / that is to saye of Cryste / for of Cryste is sayde a Chrysten man / owithe notte to here / nor owith notte
to gyue credence to the perswasyon of the fende. For he is worste of all thinges / wherof it is wryttyn in the bo∣ke of Clement. He that wylfully subduyth hym self to the deuyls wyll / shall notte haue peace with God / nor with man. And saynt Augustyn sayth. The deuyl may disceyue no man / but if he wyll frely assent vnto hym. Wherfore Ierome saythe. Power of the fende is not to be drad for the drede and boste of hym is euer in the wyll of man / for the flessh doth nothinge / but the sowle con∣sentith first therto. It is rede in vitis patrum / that one hermyte was ledde by an Aungell to a sertayne place / where as was a greate congregacyon of holy monkys / and he sawe the placis that lay abought them replete with innumerable multitude of fendes flying as it had bene flyes. And whan the aungell & the Heremyte came togider to a greate Cite where as was kepte a greate fayre / this heremyte sawe but oon fende stondynge vp∣pon the gatys / and he was Idell / and not half occupyed and the Heremyte askyd what it mente. The aungell answerde and sayde. All that euyr were in the cite were aplyable to perfourme the fendes wyll / and therfor one fende was sufficient there. But in the abbaye it was cō¦trary for they resistyd manly and therfore came many fendes togider agayne them to tempte them withe dy∣uers temptacions. ¶ Of a precyows stone callyd Achate and a serpent Callyd Cerastes. Dialogo .xviii.
AS wrytith Papie ther is a stone cal∣lyd Achates / whiche is a very precy∣ows Gemme hauynge blacke ser∣clys and whyte and dyuers of colow∣re. Brito and Isydore saye Etymolo∣giarum .xvi. that hit is a stone firste founde in sicilie / be a floode of the sam Name / and aftyrwarde it hath bene fownde in dyuers placys as sayth hugucio / and it cawsith a man to be fa∣uourhable. Cerastes is a serpent so callyd as wrytithe Isidore Ethimologiarum .xii. for that he berithe .viii. hornys in his hede lyke vnto the hornys of a Ram / and the hornys of hym be oftyn tymes set vppon riche men∣nys tablys to eschewe venyme. And also of his hornys be made knyuys hastis / which were wonde to be layde before kynges and Emperowrys that be the swetynge of them it shuld be shewyd if any mete that were sette forth were infecte with poyson. This serpent consydrid in hym self that he was hatefull and odyows to euery
man and that he was also forsakyn of them. Therfore he went to the Achate and sayde. O precyous Gemme come to me and sette thy self betwene my hornys / and I shall bere the between them worshypfullye. For I vn∣derstonde wele that thowe haste greate vertue to caw∣se thy berar to be gracyows. And moreouir I promyse the that and if thowe Cawse me to be in fauowre / and belouyd I shall be my strength robbe both lordis and in nocentys / and thow shalt be partenar and haue half my wynnygis. To whom this precyows stone answerd & sayde. Thy speche lykyth me not. for the Apostle saythe Notte onely the doers of synne. but also they that con∣sent to them be worthy perpetuall dampnacion. And al∣so it is a comune saynge. As greate fawte hath he that holdith / as he that fleyth or yeldyth. Therfore goo fro¦me / for thy disposicyon is nat goode / and thus this pre∣cyows Gemme departyd fro the Serpent & sayde. Contrarye to synne we owe to be. And not consent therto perde. THus did Dauid whan he sayde Psalmo .c. I haue hatyd synnars thongh it were my fadir or moder / suster or broder / or frende / or Bisshoppe or in any maner of degre that wilfully wolde offende / and soo vtterly I wolde flee his feleshippe that I wolde neuer thinke vp¦pon hym. wherfor it is wryttyn in policrato. libro nono, that saynt Iherome excludyd thre Clerkys frome his bourde. For they were vnmanerlye / and also he sayde / it was rebukefull for a worshypfull man / or for a man of auctorite to kepe any euyll disposyd persone in hys com∣panye. ¶ Of Golde and Lede. Dialogo .xix.
IN a great hastynes Leede went to golde and sayde. why art thowe so prowde a∣gayn me. Am not I of the substaunce of metallys as wele as thowe. wherfore dispysist thow me / and thow disdarnyst that I shulde be as precyows as thowe. Come nere to me and proue me in fyre / and thow shalt see the greate vertewe that is in me. To whome Gold answerde and sayde. I knowe wele that owre creatowr hath made the as he hath made me / and so I contynewe as I was ordeynyd be hym. Therfore I doo noon iniu∣rye to the. wherfore take thow that is thyne and stryue not with me / for it behouith vs to be prouyd in all thin∣ges as the holy Apostle writith i. Thessal .v. and sayth thus proue ye euery thinge and kepeye that thinge that is good. Go to the fyre and than shall thy vertewe and victorye apere. And whan they were to gidir in the fyre the leede consumyd and vanyshed awaye. The Golde was puryfyed and came forth fayre and bryght & sayde. Woordes of boste of pompe and of pryde Be but in vayne / thowgh they be blowyn wyde
MOch prowde people be in that same cace thinking they haue vertewe / which is not in them. And therfore if thay haue a lytel blaste of temptacion / they be soone ouercome / and brought to nought as lede in the fire. Therfore and if thow intende to be precyows in the sight of Godde / stody and aplye the to be meke & lowlye in thyn own mynde. Wherfore Isidore saith. Be thow lyke a chylde lowlye in thyn own sight / that thou mayst be greate in the sight of Godde. Forsomoche the more precyows shalt thow be in gods sight / how moche thow arte humylyate in thyn own conscience. And he that is vyle to his owne mynde / is greate to Godde. Gregory saith. Consydre the more gloryous thow art in thyn own mynde. The more vile arte thowe before Godde and his aungellys. In Rome somtyme was a ladye / of so greate humilite and reuerence / yt she thought her self vnworthye to come nyghe the awter / and to be∣holde the blessyd bodye of ower lorde. when it was lyfte vppe. Wherof it fortunyd on a tyme / when the people were how sild she for greate mekenes and honowre came not nere to receyue it. wherfore be the operacyon of al∣myghty Godde / it was so all the people stondynge and beholdinge ther came a lylywhy the doue and toke the hoste from the awter and delyuerid it vnto herre withe greate worshyppe / and therfore humylyte and mekenes is comendale / and Contynually to be obseruyd / and kete. ¶ Of Golde and Syluer. Dialogo .xx.
VPpon a tyme Gold went to syluer and sayde. Be mery brodyr / for we twayne bere the pryce amonge all othir metal∣lys. And if we were conioyned togider we shulde be of greate sublymyte and worshype. Wherto Syluer gaue this answere and sayde. Broder thowe spekist charitably. but I consydre wele that thy colowre is reede and myn is whyte. Also I remembre that thow arte of grete re∣putacyon and incomparable valowre. Wherfor I trow verely that lyke as we be deuydid and cōtrary in pryce and in valowre / so shall we be deuydid in owre wyllys. It is bettyr therfore for vs not to begynne coniunccyon than aftyrwarde to make separacyon and to withdraw vs frome the thinge that is begon / and also syluer sayd these wordis. No wysdom it is for any man to aplye. To compare with his bettyr / nor to steppe to hye.
AS it is wryten Ecclesi .xiii. He chargith him self with an importable burdon / that ioynythe hym self to his bettyr / and also hit is wryttyn in that same place. Be thowe no felowe to hym that is rycher than thowe. wherfore the philosofre sayth. The poreman pe¦risshith whan he begynnyth to stryue with the ryche man / as Isope shewith in a fable and saith that the go¦te / the shepe and the asse vppon a tyme made a confede¦racye with the lyon and compenyed withe hym to goo an huntynge togyder / as felows and neybowris / and all they togider toke an harte. But whan they shulde deuyde it / the lyon spake and sayde. I shall be eyre of the first parte. For I am grettist of worshppe here / and the first choyce shall yelde me the secounde parte / and ye grettist labowre shall gyue me the thryd yarte. And but if I haue the forth parte I shall breke the conuenaunte of concorde / and with these wordys he began to gryne with his teth / and smote the grownde with his tayle / so soore that all they for fere rane awaye / and lefte all the hoole harte to the lyon. Wherby it apperithe that a man owith to be ware to assocyate hym self with his bettyrs / for he shall euyr be put to the worse parte / as it is sayde in a commune prouerbe. I counsell not seruaun¦tis to ete Cheryes with ther bettyrs. For they wyl ha¦ue the Rype / and leue them the harde / & therfore saith Isope. By this exemple it is shewyd that it is not good for the weke to be ioyned to the myghty / for he wyl not at all tymes be faithfull vnto hym. ¶ Of Syluer and Iryn. Dialogo .xxi.
Syluer in a season vncurteyslye and vndiscre¦telye spake vnto Iryn and sayde. O vnhap¦py creature. Cursyd be thy generacyon. for by the infynyte sorowis be wrowght in the worlde. For of the be made swerdis / shaftis¦dartys / brestplatys / helmettis / and all ma¦ner of wepyns and harneys / for to punyssh & to slee man By the also batellys and stryues happyn in the worlde If thowe haddist not be made / the worlde had bene yn greate tranquillyte and reste. Iryn this herynge withe greate reason excusid him self and sayde. Howgh brodie thow spekyst not trwlye / for I doo no wronge to the. For and if I be a malefactor as thowe reportyste / thyn owne consideracyon shall proue it / if thow take hede. For withowte me no worke can be made. By me alsoo crastys be occupyed and the erthe berythe / Men alsoo worke by me & dryue me in length & bred / & forge of me what it pleasith thē / & Isay not nay / but obey to thē as my makr hath ordeinid me. yf thei make of me othrwise
then goode it is ther blame and not myne. For I do as I shuld doo. But I meruayle of the that so sone conste see a lytell fawte in myn ye / and consyderiste not a greate beame in thyn owne. For and if all trowthe shuld truly be declaryd thou art orygynall of all myschefe. Be the meanys of the / men fall to thefte / adulterye / Man∣slaughter / and many othyr crymes. By the also trouth and rightwysnes perissheth / and be destroyd Rape and vsurye come be the. Thowe desseyuiste the sowle of mā and bringith it to perdycyon. Therfore it had bene bettyr for the to haue holde thy peace / and not to speke so inordi¦natlye / but a fole cannot speke / that cannot be styl / and therfore it is sayde in prouerbe. Or euir the worde be forth I broughte. Considre before what thow haste wroughte FOr saynt Augustyn sayth. Let thy worde firste come to thy mynde / and aftyr to thy tonge. whā a Philosofre was in company of moch people / and spake but fewe woordys / he was askyd the cause / and he sayd It hath repentyd me of my speche. But neuyr of scilence wherfore Caton sayth. It hurtyth noman to be styll / but it noyeth to speke to moch. There was somtyme a goode thrysty man / which in his hows had thre cockys And also he had within that same place of his habyta∣cyon a seruaunte / which ledde noon honest lyfe. That consyderige the cockys / oon of them sange in this wyse / and sayde. Suche dedys that seruaunt doth / which shal not please owre mastyr. This heringe the seruaunte / sayde. This cok shall lyue no lengar / and immediatlye cawsid hym to be slayne. An othyr daye the second cok lyfte vppe his voyce & sange thus. For sayng of trouth my felowe is dede / and euyn forthwithe this seruaunte put hym to deth. Then the thryd cocke was wyse / and
thought he wolde saue hym selfe and sange in this ma∣ner and sayde. Here / see / and hold thy peas / if thow in∣tende to lyue in peace / and therfore he had his lyfe / and contynuyd longe in greate welth and prosperite. ¶ Of Tynne and Brasse. Dialogo .xxii. Tynne and brasse confederide togidere enuyede a∣gayne Golde. Wherfore they deuysid a pot full of fayre Copyr and bryght / and broughte it to the markette and solde it / affermynge with su∣gryd wordys / that this Copyr was Golde. A sertayne chapman came and bought yt. and ioyfully ba∣re it home. And whan he wolde haue prouyd the perfec∣cyon of the Golde / he fownde it Copir. Wherfore he was replete with indignacyon and cawsid Golde to be Cyted before a iuge / for by cawse he had deceyued hym. Notwithstondynge Golde made his trewe excuse / and sayde to the iuge / that he neuyr solde the potte / nor de∣uisid it / nor it was neuyr of his generacyon nor kynrede. Wherfore in great haste the iuge cawsyd ye vendytow∣ris all to be Cyted before hym and punyshed them with greate paynes / and so be compulsyon they confessyd the trowth and shewid that they did it for enuye / whiche they bare agayne Golde / and ther intent was for to ha∣ue slaundrid hym that his Name shuld haue bene apay¦rid and that he shuld not haue bene so precyows / in the worlde. Wherfore the iuge discretelye correctyd them lyke ther deseruynge and comendid. Golde greatly and sayde. He that is bothe goode and pure May euyr sleape sowndlye and sure.
MAnyon intend in lykewyse to diffame ther bet∣tyrs / be false wytnes. And he that berythe false wytnes shall not be vnpunysshed / as it is wryt∣tyn Prouerb .xix. A false wytnes shall not be vnpuny¦shid and he that spekyth lesynges shall not escape / that is to saye the iugement of Godde. And it is wryttyn in the same place. A false witnes shall perish / as it is wry¦tyn in collacyonibus patrum. That somtyme an abbot∣te callyd pafuncyus whan he was yonge and gracyous and sate in his Cell / oon of his bredryn enuyed at hym / and for to put hym to a slawnder he wente and hid his bocke in the bedde of pafunce. And whan masse was fy∣nysshed and endyd and all the monkys were congrega∣te togider / this vntrewe brodyr reportyd and sayd that his boke was stolyn. Wherfore thre brodryn were assy∣gnyd to serche in euery Cell and they fownde the boke in pafuncis bedde / and thus he was falslye accusyd be∣fore all his bredryn and assignyd to doo greate penaunce for thefte which he neuyr comyttyd. But notwithston∣dinge he mekely suffyrde it and performyd it. And whā he had continuyd in penance a sertayne season / this fal∣se monke was vexyd with a fende / and publyshed hys offence / with lowde clamoure / and shewid that he had wrought that soteyltye hydinge the boke / and that he did it for enuye / for to haue diffamyd the holy man / and desired hartely that he myght be brought vnto hym to be delyuered fro the fende by his hooly prayers. And whan he was brought before hym he was immediatly helyd and delyueryd from the fendis possessyon. Wher∣fore saynt Gregory spekyth of false witnes and sayth. He that berithe false wytnesse is culpable to thre person¦nys. Firste vnto Godde whose penaunce he forsakith. Secounde to the iuge / whome he disseyuith by his lesin∣ges.
Thryd to the innocent whiche he hurtythe by hys false wytnesse. And therfore be the lawe a false wytnes¦ser is bounde to make restitucyon of all suche goods as he hathe cawsid his neybowre to lese be his false re∣corde. ¶ Of the Locke and the kaye. Dialogo .xxiii Akaye ther was somtyme. Which was verye goode / and plesauntlye opynde her locke / and also made it faste / in so moche that the patrone / and ownar therof reioycyd greately therin. Vp∣pon a tyme thys Locke fel in froward mynde and grutchyd agayne the kay and sayde thus. O wykked creature why pursewyst
thow me thus continuallye dayly thow entrist in to my bowellys and tournyst my stomak vppe and downe. Cece of thy greef and trowble me no more / or ellys I shall caste the awaye or make the crokyd. To whome ye kaye answerde & sayde. Sustyr thow spekyst euyll. By me thowe arte conseruyd in prosperite and defendid frō thyn enymyce. If thowe wylt be separate and departyd fro me / thow shalt be destroyde and brokyn and cast a∣waye. But this notwithstondinge the locke was not pleasyd but sodeynly stoppyd fast the hole / and wolde not suffre the kaye entyr in to hym / and soo the ownar cowde not opyn the dore. wherfore he was angrye / and in a sodeyn hete he smote of the locke / & brake it for cause it wolde not opyn. wherfore the kaye scornyd the locke & sayde in this wise. with thy frende that mayntaynith the. Discorde thow neuir in noo degre. BEware therfore to stryue or varye with him that thow lyuyste with famylyerly. For Seneca sayth Nothinge is more fowle then to be at stryf and varyaun¦ce withe hym that thowe louyd and bene conuersaunte with. Neuerthelesse they that desire to lyue peseablye with ther neybowris / shuld helpe to supporte them and bere parte of ther charges as the Apostle wrytythe ad Galat .vi. Euery one of yowe bere the burdon of othir. Tully also saith. Ther is nothinge but it maye be suf∣firde of hym that perfightlye louith his neybowre / as it is rede in the Hystory scolasticall. That antipater Idu meus whiche was fader of Herode the greate was sore woundid in batell / withe many dyuers greate woundis in the Emperowris seruyce / which he gladlye suffirde / for his sake. Notwithstondinge at laste he was falsely accusyd to the Emperowre. And whan he was brought
before hym / he spake to the Emperowre and sayde. My Lorde I wyl not shewe yowe fayre wordys for myn ex∣cuse. but these greate woundis whiche I haue suffyrde for youre loue / let them speke for me / and expresse also the greate loue and verey trewe harte that I haue euir owghte to yowe. And immediatlye the Emperowre re¦ceyuyd hym to grace / and shewyd hym greate fauowre euyraftyr. Also hit is rede in the firste boke of Iapis of Philosophirs / of Iulye Cesar howe ther was an olde man lyklye to haue perished in a stryf vppon a daye / & whan he came before the iugis he prayde the emperour to come and helpe hym. And the Emperowre assygned one to helpe hym. To whome he answerde and sayde. O Emperowr Remembre I fawght my self for the in the batell of Asye / and made no proctoure / and disclosyd his woundis whiche he had there / and shewyd them to the Emperowre. Wherfore he went hym self perso∣nallye and sped his besynes / and was sore ashamyd in hym self to be Reputyd not oonly prowde / but also vn curteys and vnlouynge. Wherof it is wryttyn. He that labowrith not. etethe not. And also the same Emperor sayth. He yt labowrith not to be louynge to his knygh∣tes. Cannot be fauourable to them / as it is sayde in lawde of the same Emperowre that he neuyr vside to saye. Goo ye / but goo we / for he was euyr partetaker of ther labowre as on of them / and that was at all ty∣mes of any iubardye. ¶ Of the Cawdron and the Chayne Dialogo .xxiiii.
THe chayne spake to the Cawdron vppon a ty∣me and sayde. Thowe arte greatlye vnkynde for I bere the to the fire / and thowe daylye se∣thyst many a goode morsell and geuyst me ne∣uyr parte to ete with the. Thy glotony is gre∣te. For thow consumyst all and leuist me hungrie. The Cawdron answerd and sayd. Thou seruyst me to my hurte. And therfore thowe arte not worthy to be re∣wardyd / but rather to be punyshed for thowe holdiste me vppe to the fyre / sore agayne my wyll and cawsiste my sydes to be brent and consumyd. And therfore yf my power wolde extende therto I wold gladly destroye ye. But and yf thow be wylfull to do me acceptable seruy∣ce. Ordeyne to me thinges profitable and necessarye and not contrarye / and also he sayde. Seruyce that is doth good and prefytable Is louyd to all men and acceptable.
THerfore and yf thow desire to doo seruyce to othir men / serue them to ther pleasure / that they maye thanke the. Or ellys thow shalt lese thy rewarde For Seneca saith. He that cannot gyue rewarde / vnri∣ghtfully askyth it / that is to saye. He that cannot gyue a rewarde profytable / desyreth it vnrightfully. Smale bestys teche vs to yelde godenes. As it is rede that the mows went vppon the lyon whyll he slepte / and the lyon cawght hym and wold haue etyn hym. But the mows spake mekely to the lyon and sayde. Be pacyent to me and haue mercy vppon me / and I shall yelde itte the whan I may. The Lyon began to smyle and laugh thinkynge his habylyte was weke and small to do for hym. And breuely aftyr it fortunyd that the Lyon was take in a nette. That knowynge the mows. Came & gnewe a sondyr the cordys / & delyuered the Lyon owte of dawnger. But euyll disposicion is not lyghtly chan∣ged in lordis and myghty men be gyftes and benefytes done to them / but rather it is apayrid and worse & con∣tinuyth in shrewdnes. Wherfore it is tolde that a yon∣gman in the wynter season / sawe a serpent almoste ded with feruence of great colde / and he hauynge pete of it / toke it vppe and put it in his sleue. but whan he was warm he stonge hym / and destroyde hym. Therfore sayth Seneca. A Serpent in the wynter is not to be hā¦dlyd with suretye for though he lye styl he secyth not to stynge and to shede his venyme. ¶ Of Rosemary and of the Fylde. Dialogo .xxv.
AS hit is rede of the vertewe of erbys Rosmarye amonge al othir vertewis hath this vertew in especyall. That and if he be plantyd in a felde / or in a vyneyerde and kepte Clene and wor¦shypfully / the vynes shalbe fruteful and reioyce greately / and the Cornis shall multyplye and largely encrece. For the whiche cawse a sertayn feylde continually beynge infructuous and bareyn went to the Rosmarye with humilite and deuocyon and prayde hym that he myght be frutefull / and sayde. O gracyous pastor and goode keper come to me and defende me / and I shall sette the clene and clen∣ly / and also I shall serue the. All oonely I desire the to sytte styll and reste the in me that the rathr be thy good¦nes I may bringe forth holsome and kyndely frewte. The Rosemary was mouyd with piete / and ouercome with the fayre supplicacyon of the feelde / & went forthe¦with
hym and sette him selfe in the myddys of hym. Who rulynge and defendinge / the felde recoueryd and waxyd grene / and multiplyed and brought forth frute Threscore fold and an hundridfold with greate haboun¦daunce and gladnesse and sayde in this wyse. For on godemannis sake / many othir moo. Be oftyn conseruid and kepte owte of woo. THus owght the people to doo / when they haue no gider. To chese a prouyd man / ryghtfull and wise / which be his polycye and wysdome may gouerne them wysely and defende them. Verely and truly a wi∣se kynge is a sure stablysshment of the people / as it ys wryttyn Sapient .vi. O ye kyngis yf ye delyght yowe in yower Royall seys. Loue ye wysdome. Loue ye the lyght of wysdome that be preferryd to haue rule of the people / ad Ecclesiast. A wyseiuge shaliuge his people The prince hode of a wyseman shall be stable. And yt is wryttyn in the same place. A kynge vnwyse shall le∣se his people and the Cyteys shall be inhabyte be the reason of wisemen. Wherfor Salomon desyrid of God a techeable harte / that he myght teche ye people of God and discern betwene good & Iuyll. Also vigecyus sayth de re militari. No man owith more to knowe nor bettyr to knowe euery thinge than the prince and ruler. whos doctryne shuld be to all his subiectis moste profitable. For truly yongmen be not oftyn to be chosyn rulers for it is not most expedient forsomoche as they be not al∣waye stedfaste / and wyse / as it is sayde in the thryd bo∣ke of etykys. And Plato also sayth. Then the large worlde was prosperows and happye whan wisemen re¦gnyd / and kyngis inwardlye conceyuyd goode gydynge as sayth Valerye and also boyce in his first boke of con¦solacyon. wherfor it was callyd the goldyn worlde whē
the regne of wisemen continuyd and Seneca saith / and it is wryttyn in libro Politicorum iiii. That whyle ye commune wele amonge the Romaynes prosperyd and chenyd / the Emperowris and Rulers were conynge & wele instructe in lernynge / and I knowe not saith Sc∣neca / howe hit fortunythe that the vertew of cōnynge langwyssith and is abatyd amonge princes and Ru∣lers. Wherfore no meruayle though theyre state apay∣re for withowte wysdome nothinge auaylythe as holy wrytte makyth meneyon. prouerb .viii. by me kynges regne saith almyghty God. Wherfor the kynge of Ro∣maynes exhortyd the kynge of Fraunce that he shulde cawse hys sonnis to be imbute / and lernyd in lybetall scyence saynge. A kynge vnlernyd is lyke to an Asse crownyd. Socrates reportith in his laste boke and saith That emonge a sertayn people that is to saye in an Ile of Campanye. Dignyte of birth preuaylyth not in e∣leccyon of the kynge / but the voys of all the people. For they make eleccyon and chese one that is ornate & Clo∣thid with goode condicyons and maners. benyuolent in rightwysnes / and mercy / and also sad of age and that hath no children. And if he be prouyd of his people to continewe in any great synne he shall dye & be destroyd. ¶ Of Rewe and of venymows bestis Dialogo .xxvi. IN the boke of de virtutibus erbarum it is wryttyn Rewe amonge all othr ver¦tuys that she hath in especyall this ys oon. That if she be takyn in drinke or in mete she meruelously preuaylythe a∣gayne venyme / and agayne almaner of
venymows bytynges or styngynges if she be brosid or stampyd with garlyke salte and nottis. And so for this greate vertewe that she hath agayne venyme / all ve∣nymows bestis came togider to her and sayd. We pray the departe owte of Compenye / and medle not betwene vs and mankynde. for we intende in all owre mynde for to sowe owre venyme amonge men / and for to destroye them / for the which cawse they pursewe vs and slee vs To whom Rewe answerde and sayde. yower wordes be wycked and my scheuows. Of yowe it is wryttyn in the Psalter Psalmo .xiii. The venyme of aspys is vn¦dir theyre tongis. ye cursyd serpentis why be ye aboute to destroy mā whō god hath created & made to be lorde of all thinge. And forasmoch as ye saye yt I haue grace & vertewe agayne yowe / and also agayne yowr veny∣me / fro this tyme forthwarde / the Grace of God shall not be voyde in me. but his grace shall euer dwell in me For I shall euyr aplye me to be Contrarye vnto yowe and vnto yower badde disposycyon / and resyste yowe
that ye shall not fulfyll yowre euyll intent / and also she sayde these wordes. Gode people owith euyr to preuayle Agayn synfull that wold them assayle. EVyn thus shuld Rulers doo / and wyselye euyr re¦siste to bad folkys and to saye Naye to them and to punyssh them. For Seneca sayth. He Noyeth goode folkys that sparyth the bad. For sothly a iuge owithe not to spare male factowris / for a iuge correctynge not the synfull committith to synne as sayth Seneca. wherfore Ambrose sayth. when indulgence and fauour is shewyd to the vnworthye / many othir be prouokyd to synne therbye / as valery rehersith in his .v. boke. of oon callyd bruto the whiche was first consull of Ro∣maynes the whiche comaundid his owne sonnys when they were brought before hym syttynge in ingement to be sore betyn with roddis and aftyr that to be behedid. For by cawse they intendid to reduce the lordshyppe of Tarquynye / which he had expullyd. For he had leuyr to be withowte Chyldryn / then to lacke to doo dewi punyshment. A semblable example shewith saynt Au∣gustyn .v. de Ci. Dei. That a sertayn Emperower of Rome comaundid vppon payne of deth that no man shuld fight agayn the fowwarde of his ennemyes And his owne sonne which was oftyn prouokyd of them. Onys faught with them manly and defendid the con∣tray and put them to the worse. But all that notwith∣standyge his fadir comawndid hym to dethe. For bre∣kinge of his comawndment. And therfor Rightwysnes is euyr to be kepte and obserued. ¶ Of Isope and a man Callyd Marcurye Dialogo .xxvii
BRito saith ther is an erbe namyd Isope apte and goode to pourge the lungis. An othir au¦tor saith that Isope with oxymell destroy∣eth flewme that is towgh. For which cause Marcurye whome Gentyls namyd to be a God / but he was a false couetous man and an harde. A witche full of wykednes / and an interpre∣towr of spechis. And whyle he had helth many vicis re∣gnyd in hym therfore he was rightfully smitten of god with dyuers infirmyteis / and was made both lungsyk and Reumatyke that he myght not occupye his accosto¦myd synnes. wherfore he went to ysope and sayde. The vertewe of God is in the to hele syke folkys. For in er∣bys woordis and stonys is greate vertewe. Therfore I pray the shewe thy vertewe vppon me / and cure my lungis and destroy the flewme that is in me. And I pro¦myse to God and to the that thowe shalt be partenar of all suche goodes as shall growe to me by the meanis
of Rabeyne and of stelth. To whom Isope answerd & sayde. It is euydently knowin that in thyn helth thou hast doon innumerable crymes / and surely I thinke if thow shuldist now be restoryd agayne to helth / thou woldist doo worse. But the vertewe of God that thou sayst is in me / shall not gyue maintenaunce vnto synne Go fro me therfore / for thowe shalt neuer be helyd by me / and so he put hym forth with greate confusyon & sayd in this wyse. Synfull people whan they haue helth. Be euir the worse / and in ther moost welth. WHan God correctith and scourgithe them that be synfull with passyons of dyuers infirmyteis that they may not synne / & they be not amendid therbye. Certaynlye it is a greate tokyn of perpetuall dampnacyon. For in this lyse present euery stroke of Godys othir purgacyon of synne or ellys begynnyg of payne folowinge. For the chastisement of some folkys begynnyth here in this worlde and duryth euerlasting lye. Of dyuers men it is oftyn sayde. God geuyth not iugement twyes for on thinge. Neuerthelesse that sen¦tence attendith not that that is wrytten. God allmy∣ghty delyueringe his people owte of the londe of Egy∣pte / them that beleuyd not in hym aftirwarde he de∣stroyde. And although that oon fawte be not twyse cor¦rectyd. Neuerthelesse yf it be twyes punyshed the firste punyshment begynnyth here and continuith there eter nallye / as it is exemplyfied in those personys that cor∣recte not them self here in this present lyfe. To whom the stroke of God and of his punyshment here is a be∣ginning of euerlastinge tourmente. Here of it is wryt∣tyn in the Psalte Psalmo .cviii. Be they coueryd with ther confusyon as with a dowblette. Diplo is is callyd
a double garment / which they do on / at oon tyme / that e punysshed with temperall payne and dampnacyon perpetuall. Isope tellyth that ther was a kyte so rane∣nous that he stale whersoeuer he myght haue auaun∣tage were it neuer so nygh the chirche or sanctuarye. In so moche that he was hatefull vnto all men / for the owtrageows rauyne that he vsid. At laste he fell syke so sore that he was lyke to dye / and than he was com∣puncte and sorye for his synnes and mekyd hym self & sent for his moder in great haste / and sayd to her / Most swete moder I am very syke and feble / and I am dre∣defull of deth / for I haue bene a great extorcyonar / and oon greate hurte to many folkys. Wherfore I beseche powedere modir to goo to the Temple of Goddis and offre Sacryfice to them for me / that I may escape and recouir of this infyrmyte. For I am redye to be conuer∣tyd to a bettyr lyfe. To whom his moder answerd and sayde. In thy lyfe thow hast greately offendid the God¦dys and the sacrid power of them. The rightwysnes of them yeldith to all men aftyr theyr deseruinge. In thy helth thowe haste doone many greate offencys. If thow myghtyste escape / God knowith thow shalt do worse. For very contricyon is none in the. The drede of deth cawsith the to be meke of speche. But verylye as Isayde yf thowe myghtyste haue helthe thowe shul∣dyste be worse than thowe haste bene. Whersore I wyll not praye for thyn escape. And the kyte dyde / and departed frome the worlde in greate drede and in great heuynesse.
¶ Of a Tre callyd Abrotanum and of the hare. Dialogo .xxviii. ABrotanum as saith Oracyus is a tre which by his propyrte drawith owte all thinge that is infixte / with helpe of an othir thinge callyd anxungial Wherfore an hare that haltyd came mekely to hym which had a sharpe thorn smytyn in his fote and sayde O thow helpar both of bodye and sowle haue pyte on me and hele me / and thus saynge he lyfte his fote and shewyd it to hym. Abrotanum was mouyd with com∣passyon / and layde him selfe vppon his wownde / and brought owt the thorn and helyd hym. And verely this hare was not forgetfull of this benyfyte / but day∣lye brought a galon of watre vppon his shuldyrs / and bathyd at the Rote of Abrotanum / & cawsid hym to cō¦tynewe
grene and fressh and sayde. To owre benefactours that doth vs goode. Let vs do seruyce with a gladde mode. BVt cursyd people and vncurteys doo not soo / but rather sone forgette the benyfytes doon to them. Wherfore of Salamon was askyd what thinge shuld not esylye be forgotyn. And he sayde. Benyfytrs and kyndnes. And therfore sayth Caton. Be thow remem¦bryd of benyfytes doon to the before tyme. And also he sayth. A small gyfte that thy pooer frende geuyth the Receyue it gladlye and remembre to yelde full thankin¦gis therfore. Thow owyst to yelde the benyfites vnto thy frende. with increce yf thy power extende therto / or ellys to haue it oftyn in thy remembrawnce / that thy frende hath shewid to the / that thow mayst gyue hym thankynges at lestwyse for his goodnes / For Seneca sayth. It is a sufficyent and large rewarde / for a goode bede / to be hadde oftyn in Remembraunce. And alsoo the same clerke saith. He is vncurteys that yeldith a good turn withowte vsure and encrece. It is rede in Ec¦clesiasticall Hystory / that ther was a lyonesse that had a caue nere to the cell of an holy man was callyd Ma∣charye / and this Lyonesse fownde her whelpys blynde and brought them all before the fete of Macharye. And this holy man vnderstondinge that her supplyca¦cion was for her whelpis / and he by his prayers causid them to haue sighte. And this lyonesse for that she wol¦de not be reputiding rate and vnkynde / oftyntymes she brought the skynnys of all the beastis that she toke to the cell dore of this goode man / and ther left them as for his rewarde. Also an othir beaste came to the cell of saynt Macharye with his sone that was born blynde and be sygnes and tokyns prayde hym of helpe. The
which knowynge the holy man prayde for the whelpe and anon it had sighte. And this beste thankyd hym in her maner / and went her way with her childe / & with in a shorte space she came agayne with all her chyldren lodyd all with shepes kynnes that thei had takyn / and offird them to the holy man for a gyfte / in recompensa∣cyon of his goodnesse / and made to hym obeyssance and went ther waye gyuynge to him worshyp & thankingis ¶ Of Plantayne and of the Ape. Dialogo .xxix. PLantayne is an erbe most profytable agayne the Feuyr quartayne to be remedyed. Wherfor an Ape that had a sonne vexyde withe that disease / which cowde synde no remedy for him when she had spent greate goodis yn
phisyke and mederynes. Therfore she went vnto Ma∣crum and sayde. I haue compassyd heuyn and erth and ouerwalkyd the londe / and founde no reste to my sonne but nowe at laste I haue founde the so greate a lethe.  Therfore gyue me thy councell and helpe that I maye delyuer my chylde frome this quartayne disease. Ma∣cer that his cawse shulde be founde trewe sayde thus. Take .iiii. rotys of Plantayne and gyue them the pa∣cyent and he shall soone be curyd. The Ape that hering ordeyned breuely the medecyne and helyd her sone and sayde thus. A connyge leche that can vs saue. We muste seke that helth wyll haue. SO we desyringe helth of owre sowlis muste serche for a preste and a confessowre that is sufficientlye lernyd that both can and maye bynde and vnbynde. Thus owist thou to do thou crysten man or woman to fynde the wayes to saue thy sowle. For Isidore sayth. Euery synner be penance receyuyth helth of his woun∣de. But the medicyne is to be takyn aftyr the gretnesse of the sore / and aftyr the profoundite and depnes of the wounde the remedye is to be sowghte / as it is rede that dyuers Theuys beynge in greate iubardye and tem∣pest in the see / made a vowe if they myght escape they wold be confessyd. And aftir ther escape they made con∣fessyon to an heremyte. Of whome to the mastir these whan he was confessyd the heremyte inioyned for hys greate offencis and enormyteys that he shuld goo to ye Pope to be assoylyd. wherfore he kyllyd the Heremyte / & forth he went to the seconde Confessor / and also hym he kyllyd. And so he went vnto the thryd confessor. And whan he had shewyd hym hys Confessyon / he intretyd hym curteyslye / and thus whan he perceyuyd
that he cowde not mollyfye his harte nor withdrawe hym frome his wyckednes / lyk a very fair and a prin¦cypall leche of sowlys he inioynyd hym that whan any creature was dede / if he were nyghe / he shulde laye the corse in the graue / and so he dyd. And by that meys he conceuyd a remembraunce / wherto he shulde come and howe sone he knew not. And thus the deed of deth was so fyxed in his mynde that he ordeyned his state bettyr and amendid his lyfe and went in to wyldernesse and toke vppon him greate penaunce and endid in vertewe Wherfore it is wrytten in the glose. Nothing auaylith more to chastise and destroye the flesshly desires / than to thinke oftyn vppon deth. ¶ Of Varuayne and the Wolf. Dialogo .xxx.
MAcer saith that whan thow visitest ye syke if thow bere varuayne vppon ye and aske of the pacyent how it is with hym / if yt he saye wele / he shall escape and haue helth. And if he answer and saye it is iuyl with me / ther is no trust of amendment. Wherfor a wolf which was a leche gre¦tely namyd had a syke person in cure and daylye gaue hym good hope of amendment. The foxe knowing the vertewe of Varuayne and intending to begyle the wolf he went to vysite the pacyent and bare with him a brā¦che of varuayne and inquirid how it stode with him. To whome the syke answerde and sayde. Ful hardlye and full syke I am. The foxe beyng sure that he shuld dye departyd strayghte fro the pacyent and went to the wolf that had hym in cure and askyd of hym howe he thowghte be by the syke persone. Whethir he shulde ly¦ue or dye, To whome the wolf answerde and sayde yt he shulde soone be curyd and helyd of his disease. For he is in amendinge quod the wolf as I consydre by mo¦cyon of his pulse and also by his vryne. The foxe smy∣lyd and sayde. Leche thow arte begylyd / and knowyst not the crafte of medecyne / for he may not escape by any meane / for the sentence of deth is geuyn to hym. The wolf sayde contrarye / and thus they varyed and stry∣uyd togider in presence of many personys and layde gre¦te pleggis and waiers .vppon the prof of the trowth of the mater. But breuely to tell. The man dyed and de∣partyd from the worlde within the space of .ix. dayes / and the wolf was confusyd and lost his waiers and al his goode / and Remaynyd in greate pouertye & sayde. Waiers to laye of thinges vnknowe Is no wysdome / but madnesse I trowe.
THerfore beware and bynde not thy self to tho thin¦gis that thow knowist not. Nor speke thou not but that thou arte sure of that thou be not discey¦ued. For Socrates saith / ther was oon that askyd how he myght best saye Trowth. And he answerde & sayde If thow saye nothinge but that thow knowist for ser∣tayn. Thā shalt thou nat lye. And as ye philosofre saith If thou fere to speke that thou shalt repent / bettyr it is euyr to be styll. But manyon wyll defende ther sayngis be they good or euyll / to ther power and fall at stryf & debate with euery persone and neuir be in reste. Wher∣of ther is a tale that a woman which was vsyd and acustomyd to stryue / walkyd by the fylde withe her husbonde / and he sayde the fylde was mowe downe / & she sayd it was shorn. And so they multyplyed so ma∣ny wordis that at the laste her husbonde all to coryed her. But she wold not be styll / but sayd it was clyppid with sherys. Werfore in a greate angir he cut owte her tonge. And whan she myght no more speke. She made sygnes with her fyngers lyke sherys meaninge the fil¦de was Clypped. A lyke tale is tolde of an othyr wo∣man thewich stryuynge with her husbonde sayd that he was lowsye. And he was mouyd and greuyd withe her for her sayng / and bete her greuously / but she wold not amend her. But came before all her neybowris and callyd hym so to his rebuke. Wherfore he was replete with ire and threwe herin to a water and trade on her and drownyd her. And whan she myght not speke / she lyft vppe her hondes and made tokyns with her them bys as thoughe she kyllyd lyce. Wherfore it is wryt∣tyn Ecelesiast .xxviii. Many haue fall by the stroke of sworde / but not lyke to them that haue be destroyd by the meanys of theyre tongis / and therfore bad speche
is to be refraynyd. ¶ Of a Frute callyd Mandragora / and of the desyrous woman. Dialogo .xxxi. AS sayth saynt Augustyn super Ge∣nesim Maudragora is of the kynde of an apple. And of this Apple kynde he saith some men haue opynyon if it be receyuyd in mete or drinke. It caw¦sith secoundite and frutefulnesse to them that be bareyne. And for thys grete vertew which she hath. Venus ye goddesse of ad∣ultery / which excercisid her lechery wiht dyuers perso∣nis / went to the mandrake & made her prayer mekely & sayde thus / O thowe best and moste frutefulltre. Loke vppon me and despyse not my prayers / but grawnte me of thy goodnes to be partetaker of the / that I maye conceyue chyldren of them that be my louers / For soth lye I am barayne and withowte the I may not concey¦ue.
Wherfore I pray the to here my peticyon / and aske of me what thow wolte. To whom the mandrake say¦de. O thowe most vnclene of all creatures. For both ye erthe and the ayre be corrupte and defylyd of thy styn∣kynge lecherye. But moch more shulde it be infecte / yf thou myghtyst bringe forth lecherows Childryn that myght beholde the multiplyed and lyuyng delectablye Goo thou fro me in all hast possible. For euyn nowe I am replete tedyouslye and stoppid of the stenche of thyn vnclennes. And so the mandrake expulsyd her owte of her presence with confusyon to her and sayde. Put away strompettis that drede for no shame Talkynge of them shal hurte thy good name FOr it is wrytten Ecclesi .ix. The speche of an vnclene woman and Iuyll disposyd brynnythe lyke fyre. He that louith chastite and to kepe hym clene owyth not to talke moche with women. Nor gyue au∣dyence vnto them / but put them of / and gyue them no credence. For it is perylous to the sowle. As saynt Ie∣rome tellyth of a martyr which whan he had ouercome all maner of tourmentys / he was layde in a bedde stra¦wyd full of flowris / where as a strompette was fayre of body lye fauowre / whiche Towchyd his flessh / and mouyd hym to synne. And he hauynge especyall loue to chastyte and clennesse / with his owneteth bote a sondir his tonge and spet it in her face with bloode and all. In confusyon of her corruption and mayntenaunce of hys chastyte. Also a quene of Fraunce whan she sawe oon M. Perotte which was a wyseman and had passingly fayre hondis she callyd hym to her and sayd. O howe worthy be these fayre fyngers for to towche / and to fele the secrete partys of the Queene. This heryn∣ge he with drewe his hondis and sayde. Naye ladye
it shal not be soo. For and yf my fyngers shuld touche yow in that maner / and if I shuld kepe them aftyr. I wold thinke them so vnclene of that towchinge that I wold abhorre to put them vnto my mowth euyr aftyr whyll I lyued. ¶ Of the Rosyer and the Partryche Dialogo .xxxii. IN a sertayne herbar ther grewe a fayre Rosyer replete with swete rosys / it hap¦pyd so that a partryth comynge by and beholdinge the rosys desyryd greatly to haue of them and sayde. O thou beaw∣tyfull flowre of all flowris graunt me of thy Rosys / For I desyre to refresshe my self a while in these swete odowris. To whom the Rosyer answerd
and sayde. Come to me moste interely belouyd sustyr & take to yowr pleasure of the beste and of the fyreste. And whan the partryche was flow yn vppon the Ro∣syer to gadir the rosys / the sharpe spynis and thornis prykkyd his fete and leggis so sore that gladlye he de∣partyd withowt rosis and sayde in this wyse. The rosis be both swete and softe. The thornis be sharpe and prykkyth me ofte. THe Rosyer betokenithe the worlde. The rosis amonge thornis be worldlye rychesse / which our sauiour remembrith in the Euangely of Luke / & saynt Gregorye saith in the exposicyon of the same. Who shuld beleue me yf I shuld be interpretatiō assem¦ble rychesse to thornis / and especyally for thornis pryk¦ke and rychesse be delectable / and neuerthelesse they be Thornis / for be the prykkynge of their inordinate loue they wounde the mynde of man / and whan they bring it vnto synne it is as a blodye wounde newe smyten. And also Bernard saith. yowr rychesse be vayne. For they promyse lordshippe / and cawse thraldom. They promyse suretye and bringe in drede. wherof it is wryt∣tn i. ad Timotheum .vi. They that wyll be made ri∣che / fall in to greate temptacyon and snaris of the fende and in to dyuerse vnlefull desires vnprofitable and noy¦hable which bringe men to deth and to perdycyon / as Ie¦rome tellith of Crate Theban a Philosofre / the which threwe a greate peace of fyne golde in to the see & sayd. Goye fro me ye wykkyd couetyse. I drown yowe in to the depe see / for fere that I be not drownyd of yow. To the which a lyke example is put of Saynt Gregory of an othyr Philosofre / whiche bare withe hym by the waye a greate wege of Golde / and in hys mynde reuo∣luynge and consyderinge that he cowde not possede ry∣ches
and vertewe togidyr. He wylfullye threwe frome hym the Golde and sayde thus. O ye vay∣ne rychesse goo fro me / and euyr mote ye be farre fro¦me. And therfore couetyse is euir to be dispisyd. ¶ Of a Thorny tre callyd Rampnus and of the wylde gote. Dialogo .xxxiii. PApye sayth / Rampnus ys a whyte thorn or a thornye tree. Saynt Au∣gustyn sayth in the Glose vppon the Psalter that Rampnus ys a kynde of Thornis most thicke / the which in his erbe is fayre & softe / whan he is yonge / but in processe he waxith thorny & ful of spynys
The wylde gote went to this tre whyle it was in erbe both yonge and tendir and fedde hym self therof sobyr∣lye and swetelye. Aftyr a whyle this wylde gote remem¦bringe of the swete relece of this tre. Returnyd agayne to hym wyllynge to ete of him as she had doone before tymes. But this tre was than replete withe thornys which were indurate and harde / that whan this goote tastyd and gnewe of them / they were infixed and stak faste in her throte / and in the palate of her mowth and greuyd hersore. This beste for anguysshe and greate payne and for tourmentis that she suffirde cursid thys tre and sayde in this wyse. Cursyd wretche thy begynnynge was goode. Now art thou alterde in to a wykked moode. SO manyon makyth a good beginnynge / but they bringe it to no goode endynge. Wherfor they indu¦ce malediccyon vpon them self / as Ierome sayth. In a Crysten man a good endynge is lawdid and comended more than a goode begynnyge. For Pawle began iuyll and endyd wel / Otherwhile the begynnyge is lawdyd / and the endynge is damnyd / as Isidor sayth. The ende is euyr to be sowghte in the lyfe of man. For God behol¦dith not what we haue be. But in owre laste endynge what we be. And Cipriane sayth. Aftyr his laste ende euery man shalbe sauyd or dampnyd. Ther was som∣tyme a knyghte wyllynge to entyrin to relygion atten¦dinge the greate offencis and parellys that he had doon with his tonge. wherfore he sente his seruaunte vnto ye abbot to shewe him his purpose / and also to saye to him that he was mute & redye to be obedyent in euery thing And he was receyuyd there / and they beleuyd that he cowde not speke. And whan he had continuyd ther and greatly profytyd / the abbotte led him to an othr knight that
yt labowrid in extremys. And whan this knyght sawe him greatly trowblyd in his departinge from ye worlde he wepte hugelye. And whan they were departyd from the knyght / ther came an othir knyght and met withe that same abbot and made faithful promysse to hym yt as sone as he myght haue oportunite he wolde entyr in to relygion. And so he went forth before them. And as he went ouir a brygge he slode and fell inne / and was drownyd. And the othir knyght goynge with the abbot sawe the sowle of the drownyd knyghte born vppe to heuyn with Aungellys in lykenesse of a monke. wher∣of he lawghid and reioycyd greatly. And the abbot ad¦suryd hym and commaundid him in the vertewe of obe¦dience yt yf he myght speke / he shuld tell why he law∣ghid so. And he answerde and sayde. Thou hast doone puyl to cawse me speke agayne my wyl. And forthwith he tolde the abbot lyke as he had sene. & ye abbot whan he hard his saynges / he felldowne prostrate before the knyght & he toke him curteisly & prayde hī to include hī that he myght obserue and kepe his purpose.
¶ Of a tre callyd Myrtus and of the syke woman Dialogo .xxxiiii. MIrtus after the opinion of Isydore ethi mologiarum .xvii .is a tree namyd of the see / for that cawse that it growith on these bankys moche. Therfore of lechis in bokys of lechecrafte they be callyd mirene / and this tre is apte to women in many necessiteys / as they wryte / wherfore ther was a syke woman which had spente and consu∣myd all her goodis in lechis and medecynes / and cowde fynde no remedye / and at last she went to the see & foun¦de this Myrte in the see bankys to the whiche she ma∣de her prayers and sayde. O thow fayre tre haue mer∣cy of me / and graunte to me vnfortunable creature oon of thy braunchis that I may cure me / and put awaye myn infirmyte. To whom this Myrte answerde and sayde. If I gyue to the parte of me what rewarde shal I haue. To whom she sayde. Golde and syluer haue I noon / for I haue consumyd all my goodis in this disease But this I promyse to Godde and to the / that in my prayers I shal euyr haue the in remembraunce / and of suche goodis as God shall sende me here aftyr I shall departe with the. Quod the Myrte thow hast promy∣sed me a greate rewarde if thow wylte pray for me to God almyghtye. Therfore come to me and take what the lykith / and gyue me noon other goode / but oonly kepe thy promesse / and also he sayde. To gyue them and helpe them that for vs wil praye We be all bownde and not to saye Naye.
IN lykewyse we owe to doo to the seruauntes of almyghty God / that they maye praye for vs to hym. For holy prayers maye optayne what they wyll of owr Lorde as saith the glose. Orysons and prayers defendith vs from the Ire of God as a bokler defendith the bodye fro strokys. And Origene saith Oon godeman preuaylyth more in prayinge than ma∣ny synners in fightynge / as it is exemplyfied. Exodi .xvii. Whan Moyses was in deserte with the children of Israel. A kynge callyd Amalech faught with him. And whan Moyses sawe his aduersary preuayle / and he shulde haue be ouercome / he made recourse vnto his prayers / and lyfte vppe his hondes vnto heuyn and prayde / and then his people hadde the bettyr. And whā he secid and layde downe his hondes / his enymyes had the bettyr. The handis of Moyses were ponderows / & weke / and he myght not longe holde them vppe. wher¦fore as it is wryttyn .ii. men Aron & Vr / and one of them went to the right arm. An othir to the lefte arm of Moyses / and sustaynyd them / that they were styll ere¦cte vnto the tyme theyr enymyes fledde and durst no lenger byde. Wherby it aperith that prayer cawsithe victorye in batell bodylye apparent. It is redde in histo¦riis transmarinis. That whan Godfray of Bolayne / and his lordis were in the sege of Antioche / and Carbe¦ra Prynce of Cheualrye of the kynge of Perce / with a greate multitude of Turkys and Sarazyns had layde them rownde aboute. Thei were so sore afflicte withe hongre & thruste / that they had nothinge to ete / & ther horsys for great hōgre ete ye barkis of treys / & whā thei had made ther prayers to God / thei cam out manly a∣gayn the Turkis redy to iubarde ther lyuis / & god sent vpon them / & vpon their horsis a Celestyall dewe. By
the swetnesse of the which both they and theyre horsis were so fortified and refresshid by the space of thre days that they ouercame the sarazyns and put thē to flighte and toke many of them / and ther goodes. wherby it ape¦rith howe preualent prayer is / whā it is proferryd with deuocyon and swettenes. ¶ Of the hyghe Cedretre. Dialogo .xxxv. A Cedretre hyghe and apparente was plantyd in a mowntayne which she∣wed aboue all othir plesauntlye / in so¦moche that manyon went vppe to se it / and of that sight they were great¦ly Cheryd. And commandid it withe great commendacyon. Wherfore this
Cedre magnyfied her self inwardly and sayd within her self. I am gretly spokyn of / and lawdid of euery mā for my lawdable beawte which is worthy to be lawdyd But I trowe that if the smale plantis and treys that be grene and growe rownde abowt me / were cut down or pluckyd vppe I shulde apere moste goodely and lar¦ge withowt comparyson. Therfor me thinkith it most sure to mayme them / or fell them downe be tymes / or they ascend to highe / that they take not awaye my wor¦shyppe nor appayre it. And thus sayinge she cawsid all the yonge plantys and treys that grewe abowte her to be cut downe / and pluckyd vppe by the rote. Wherfore she aperyd nakyd and bare and within fewe dayes a greate wynde blewe fro the mowntaynes & the prowd Cedre was Curuate and ouerthrowe / and pluckyd vp by the Roote. And than she spake and sayde with grete heuynesse. They that be rulers may nothinge auayle. If they that be vndyr of helpe doth them fayle BVt manyon wyl not beleue that / but rathir couet them self oonly to apere worshypfull / and to de∣stroye other that be vnder. As it is exemplyfyed / howe the olyue and the greate rissh stryuyd togider and the olyue sayde to the rissh. Thou art but an vnprofitable wretche / but I am preualent / for I mynistre oyle vnto the helpe of man. To whom the riche answerde and sayde. Thou shalt see anon of what profyt I am / and sodeynly she was blowyn with a great wynde / frome oon waye to an othir / and as the wynde chawngyd soo she bowyd / and had no harm. And than she sayde to the olyur. More auaylyth wekenesse with mekenesse / then strength with pryde. A chylde whan he is born geuyth vs exemple of humylyte / for he is born to lyue lyke a
beaste crokyd and on all sowre / for as Dauyd sayth. He is comparyd vnto bestis insypiente and made lyke vnto them / and also he is born wepinge and not law∣ghinge / as it is wrytten Sapience .vii. The first voyce of all I haue shewyd in wepinge. And saynt Augustyn saith in his boke de Ciuitate Dei. A chylde whan he is born beginnith with wepinge. Not knowinge what hurte he shall suffre. Allonly zoroastes lawghid whā he was born / and neuerthelesse his lawghtir profited him but lytel. For he was the first inuentowre and be∣gynner of art magyk / and wychecrafte / and he was a kynge callyd kynge of Bactryanys / but notwithston¦dinge he was slayne of the kynge of Assyrye that was callyd Nynus. Saynt Iohan also saith that owre Lor∣de weppyd whan he Reysyd lazar / and the chefe cawse of his wepinge was for that he was in maner constray∣ned for the gostely helth of dyuers personys to call vp his moost tenderly belouyd frende vnto this troublous and mortall lyfe. Wherfor as solinus saith. A custome hath continuyd amonge certayn people / and yit it conti¦nuyth. That whan a chylde is born / the fader and mo∣der of it make greate lamentacyon and mournige. And whan it is dede / it is brought to the graue withe greate myrth and gladnesse. ¶ Of twayn dyuerse treys. Dialogo .xxxvi. TReys twayn grewenygh togider vpon an hyl syde. Of the which oon was fayre and goodely in apparence / and fresshly leuyd and frutefull. The othir was olde and vncomlye to beholde To theis tway treys came moche people / and seynge the greate dissymilitude betwene them. They

The tre spake to them and sayde. O ye wise men / it is wrytten in the lawe / Leuitici .xix. Iuge thow rightfully to thy Neybowre. For whan owr lorde by his power went agayne Sodome to Iuge the wyc∣ked men and synners of that contre / he sayd vnto Abra¦ham. Gene .xviii. The clamowre of Sodome is great¦ly multiplyed I shall descende & beholde whedyr they haue fulfylled in dede the clamowre that hath come to me. as who sayth. Gyue not alwaye credence to wyc∣kyd talis or euyr ye be assuryd of the profe. Therfore a iuge maye not punysh synne / but oonly that is openlye knowen. Wherof hit is wrytten Iohannes octauo. That owre Lorde sayde vnto the woman that was accusyd in adulterye. Noman hathe condempnyd the woman / and she answerde and sayde thus.
Noman goode Lorde. And owre Lorde sayde. Nor I shal condempne the. Therfore dampne me not tell ye haue prouyd of my frewte. For owr sauyour sayth. Mat .vii By theyr frewtys ye shall knowe them. The people stode styll herynge thys / and assayde of the frewte. And whan they hadde tastyd of the fayre tre / and founde no good releece in the frewte therof. They despysyd both ye teee and the frewt / and made a profe of the fowle treys frewte. and they founde it swetely sauowrid and dely∣cyouslye relecyd. and all thei togider gaue laude to God and commendid the frewte and sayde. Science and wisdome it is veray dede. To make a dewe profe / or the sentence procede. ISydore saith. Condempne no man before he be iugyd. Fyrst proue and then iuge / for thow arte bounde to knowe the trowth or thow gyue sen∣tence. and Gregory sayth. He that dampnithe a iuste man / sleyth the man lyuynge. and he that intendith to saue the wycked man / besieth hym self to quyckyn the dede / a iuge shuld neuyr proferre any sentence in ire nor withowte grete examinacyon. For it is wryttyn Pro∣uerbi .xxvii. Ire hath no mercye / wherof Valery tellith in his sixte boke. Cap .ii. That kynge Philippe / whan he was in ebriate & replete with wyne / he gaue a wron¦ge sentence againe a widowe / and she cam to hym & sayd she apelyd fro Philippe vnsobre vnto Philippe sobre. and whan he had digestyd that wyne he rouokyd his sentence / a lyke tale is tolde of a synfull woman / the which was cruelly iugid of Tholome kynge of egypte. and she withowte fere or drede appelyd vnto the beny∣gnyte of the same kynge. Which he consyderinge aftir¦warde reuokyd his sentence / and sayde / that the benyg∣nyte
and mekenesse of hym be very law / owith to ouer come all his iugement that procedid of cruelte. ¶ Of the Dolphyn and the Ele. Dialogo .xxxvii. DElphinus is a fissh of the which Isido∣re wrytteth Ethimologiar .xii. where he sayth that Dolphyns haue this cu¦stome that they folowe the voyce of man. Or vnto the noyse of a symphan they wyll lyghtly come togider. No∣thinge in the see is more swyfte. For oftyntymes they ouertake shyppes saylynge and ouer∣passe them. Whan they play in the floodes & leepe and make greate labowre in the wawes of the see. They si¦gnyfie greate tempestes. These be callyd properly sy∣mones. It is also the dolphyns kynde with sharpe pric¦kys
in his backe to sle crocodylles / ryppinge the softe belyes of them. Ther was a sertayne dolphyn in the see that founde an Ele / amonge the flodes / and stoppid her passage and pursewyd aftyr her. And whan he had takyn her of tyntymes he cowde not kepe her / she was so slypper / that euyr she escapid. Wherof the Dolphyn was greatly sorye. The Ele wyllynge to mocke the Dolphyn and to escape from him / she spake sotelly to hym and sayde. O thou merueylous Dolphyn I sorow hugely for the. For thy labowre is great to swym thus aftyr me / and thy harte is not mery. But thow labow¦rist in vayne / for thou shalt neuer take me / in the dep∣nesse of the watyr. But goo with me into the mudde / & in to the drye grownde / and thou shalt haue me at thy wyll. This dolphyn was folyssh and had loste his wyt¦te / for angyr and gulosite / and swam aftyr the ele a gre¦te pace / intendinge to destroye her. The Ele brought the dolphyn vnto shalowe watyrs and sprange in to ye mydde / and sayde to the dolphyn / come to me for the ro∣tys of the erbys shal let my passage / and thow mayste satisfye thyn apetite of me. The Dolphyn made a grete lepe to catche the ele. But she lurkyd vnder the mudde and the Dolphyn stak fast in the myre. And within a whyle ther cam a fyssher and smote throwe the Dol∣phyn and sayde. He that hath affeccyon with his enymye to goo His hurte is to be dowbtyd of his mortall foo. BEware & despyse therfor not thy enymye though he be not myghtye / but trust hym not / and bewa¦re that he deceyue the not / for Seneca sayth. A weke e∣nymye it is wysdome to drede / it is tolde in the morall lore of philosofers that xerses kynge of Mede / ordey∣ned a greate batell agayn the Grekys / and gadrid an
hoste innumerable. Wherfore oone of his sayde vnto hym. The Grekys shall neuer abyde the Iubardye of thy greate hoste / but they shall turn ther backys as so∣ne as euyr they here of thy comyng / an othir of his ser∣uauntes sayde vnto hym. It is to be drad that the kyng shall fynde cyteys and townys deserte and voyde of in∣habitauntes / and therfore he shall not mowe shew the greate strenth of his people. The thrid also sayde to ye kynge. The see is to narowe for the shippes. The castel¦lys to lytell for the knyghtes. The feldis not large I nowgh for the fotemen. The skye verye scante to the a∣rows of the innumerable multitude of the medonys. And whyll that they steryd the kyng in this wyse / and fortifyed hym with greate wordis and estymacyon of inuincyble power / and despisyd ther enymyes Dama∣chus the philosofre sayde to the kynge. This greate multitude of people that pleasith the. Is to be dredde of the. For it is very trewe / that a greate multitude of people can neuer be well rulyd. And that thinge which cannot be well rulyd maye not continewe / and therfore ther is nothing so grete but it perissheth. And euyn so it happyd as thys Philosofre Damachus had before sayde. For that greate puyssawnce of people / thin∣kinge them self in suuetye / for lakke of gydynge / and prouidence was scomfight and ouerthrowe / of but a fewe of ware personys / and wyselye ordird by greate polycye and wysdome. ¶ Of the Marmayde and the Lechowre. Dialogo .xxxviii.
SIren is a monstre of the see / and in owr tong it is callyd a Marmayde. For fro the nauyl vpwarde it is a fayre mayde. And fro thens downwarde it is al fissh. This monstre sin¦geth so swetely oftyntymes that for the gre¦te swetnesse of her songe. Shipmen forgete them self many tymes / and let theyr shippis be vngidid and fall in slepe / and therfore manyon of them peryshe. A sertayn man vnclene myndyd and lecherowsly dispo¦syd saylinge by the see coostes / espyed this Syren most fayre and couetyd her and stered her to lecherye. Thys monstre sange merylye and made noyse euer the lenger the swetter / and ordeynyd her self redy to disceyue this lecherows man and sayd to him. As I considre thy lo∣ue is greate to me. Wherfore if thow wilt haue thi desi¦re of me / descende and come to me in to the floodes / and at thyn owne wyll my bodye shall be redye. This man was so sore brent and inflamyd with lecherows desire
that he vtterlye forgate his owne wele and toke no cu∣re of hym self / but madlye lepte in to the see / & destroyd hym self. And she swam forth in to the see as she was wonde to doo / and sayde. A man that to woman his credence wyll geue. Ordaynyth a snare him selfe to myscheue. THerfore vnclene men owe to be ware / that thei pe¦rissh not throwe the beawte of woman / for that hath causyd manyon to peryssh / as it is wryttyn Eccle¦siasti .ix. Wherfore the wyseman geuyth holsome coun¦sell and saith in that same place. Coueyte thow no vyr¦gyne that thow be not slaundrid in the beawte of her. For the holy man Iob this consydering sayd. Iob .xxxi I haue made conuenaunt with myn eyn that I shulde not thinke on a mayden. Wherfore Barnarde sayth. The beawte of a woman is lyke a poysond arowe that woundith the sowle and puttith in venyme. wherfore whan Pares had takyn Elayne to his wyfe / dyuers of the philosofirs came to see her / and whan they saw her greate beawte / they coueryd ther Ien and sayde. Flee we flee we. For truly it noyeth more to the sowle / to be∣holde a fayre woman than a fowle. As oon rehersith & tellyth that a philosofre callyd democritus / put out his owne Ien. And as these other philosofirs shewe. He did it for thre dyuerse cawsis. The first cawse was / for his sight lettyd hym from his inwarde goode meditacyons The secounde for he was impacyent to see wretchis & synners flowre in greate prosperite. The thryd for he cowde not loke on women / with owte concupiscens and inordynate desyre. And therfor the sight of ye Ien owith to be kepte clene / that the sowle may be preseruyd from synfull affeccyon and corrupcyon.
¶Of a glotonous Fyssh or Beste callyd Ven¦ter Marinus. Dialogo .xxxix. VEnter Marinus. Is a belue of the see Whiche sechith his meate both in the watyr and in the londe / and also drow¦nyth hym self in the wawys of the see lyke a Fissh / and goith on the drye lon¦de lyke a beaste. Oon of these vppon a tyme / whan he had sownde mete of the watyr / he ete it on the londe / for cawse that watyrbeastis shulde notte ete with hym / an othertyme whā he had takyn mete on the londe. He ete it in the watyrs that it shulde not be takyn from hym by the beastis of the londe. And thus he continued and neuer departyd of hismetc to eny that askyd parte / but lyke an insaciable gloton kepte all to hym self. Wherfore he was odyows and hatefull to all othir beastis and fisshes. The tyme of age and of afflic¦cyon came on hym / and he was both olde and impotent
in somoche that he myght not swym / nor labowre by ye see nor goo on the londe. Wherfore he was very nedy & hongry and constraynyd with grete pouerte to aske his leuynge for almysse. But forasmoche as he neuyr ga∣ue of his own to othir whan he had plentye. Noon wol¦de departe with hym in his necessite. And therfor he ma¦de greate heuynesse and sayde. Seke for helpe bitterly he shal & seldom spede. That to noon other wilhelpe at ther Nede. MAny suche there be / that wyll nothinge departe withall for couetyse and gulosyte / dredynge that they shall lacke sustynaunce and temperall goodis. But as saynt Gregory saith. worldely substaunce is multiplyed and increcid whan it is distribute to the po∣uer people. And also he sayth. He that geuyth almesse. Receyuith more than he geuyth. And also it is wrytten Prouerb .xxviii. He that geuith to the nedye / shall not be nedye.

And whan he had harde all this /
he rose vppe and went to these yonge fysshes and sayde Children your thoughte is but foly. I counsell yow yf ye loue your helth to eschewe the nettis / or ellys ye shal make greate mournige and heuynesse whan ye be takin in them and be in daunger and not escape. These Fis∣shes whiche were yonge and lustye trustinge to them¦self and despisinge the holsome counsell of ther senyour Ioynyd ther strenghthis togider and swam in to the nettis trustinge to disruppe them and breke them. But the nettis mollyfied themself that the stroke of them myght not preuayle / and so they were takyn / and aftir¦warde they weppid and made greate lamentation and sayde. Good it is alway counsell to haue. Of such as be wise / that from parell may saue. THerfore I aduise euery man to attende to the coun¦sel of them that be sadde / and wise / and not to the Counsell of yongmen and folys. For folys louith folye and all thercounsell a greyth to the same / yongmen ha∣ue no veray rype reason / and thei loue tho thinges that longe to yowth / & they be apliable vnto them / as saith Iob .xii. In agid folke is wysdome / and in longe tyme greate prudence. Wherfore it is commaundid Ecclesi. The narracyon of senyours let not passe the. For they haue lernyd of ther fadirs before tyme / as Tullye saith be senectute. Greate thinges be not gidyd be strength / or swyftnes / or fyersnes of the bodye / but by counsell Maturite and scyrnce. Gyuers of goode counsell doo more then othir / for they be lyke vnto gouernowris in a shippe.

Dialogo .xli.
THe see wolfe callyd Lucyus / hath in his right cheke a spyne or a bone lyke to a crosse. And yf thow seke diligentlye / thow shalt fynde it. Take it and wrappe it in a lynen cloth / and bere it with the / and thow shalt not be takyn of thyn enymyes / and yf thow be takyn they shall not be takyn of thyn enymyes / and yf thowe be takyn they shall not longe kepe the / and it is sayde that this hath bene oftyn prouyd. Ther is a serpent callyd Basylis∣cus aftyr the langage of Greke. In Latyn hit is callyd Regulus / forasmoche as it is kynge of all serpentis / as wrytteth Isidore. And in englyssh some folke callyth it a Cokatrice. All serpentis seynge hym be ferefull / and slee fro hym / for with his smellynge he sleyth them. With his breth also / and with his loke he destroyeth al thinge that berithe lyfe. For the syght of him harmeles no byrde can escape. And thoughe she be farre frome hym / she is deuowrid and brent with his mowth. Not∣withstandinge a wesyll ouercomith him. Therfor men bere these wesyls vnto the cauys where as these serpen¦tis lurkyth / for almyghty God left nothinge without remedye. This serpent Basylyscus seynge the wesyll fleyth / whome Mustela callyd in Englyssh a wesyll / purswith and kyllyth. And this Mustela is but a ly∣tell beste of half a fote longe and spottyd withe whyte spottis. These serpentis Reguly be scorpyons hauyng ther beynge there drynesse is. And whan they come to watyr they brede. Idrophodos and Lymphaticos / for they Intoxicate and poyson the watyrs and cawse thē to be dedly noyhable to man. This regul{us} also is callyd sibilis of many folk / for with his hyssing somtym & oftin he sleith or euir he bite or styng. th{us} hiderto writith of hī Isidor. lib .xii .ca .iiii. but Plini{us}. lib .viii .ca .xxii. sayth,
Emōge the hespery Ethiopis is a well. Which is sup∣posyd to be the hede of Nyle / nygh vnto the which is a wylde beaste or serpent callyd Cacoblephas / but lytel of bodye / slowe in all his membris / beringe a greuous hede / which continually is lokynge downwarde to the erthe. Or ellys he shulde be destruccyon of all man kyn¦de. For all men that shulde beholde the eyn of him shul¦de dye. Of equall strength is this serpent of the basylis¦ke or Cokatrice / and he is bred in a prouynce callyd co∣ronea / and his bodye conteynith in length .xii. fyngers longe / and he goyth with a whyte spotte on his hede / & he hath a crown on his hede or a combe. With his hys∣fynge he putteth all serpentis to flyghte / and he wrap∣pyth not his bodye in many foldyngis / but he is erecte and hygh in goynge / He dryeth vppe frute treys / & bren¦nith and exurith herbis / not oonly in towchinge / but al¦so withe his blaste and hyssynge he corruptith and de∣stroyeth all thinge lyinge rowndeabowte him. He is al¦so of so greate venymosyte and pernycyon that he de∣stroyeth and sleyth them that towche him / with pole or shafte be it neuer so longe withowt tariynge / Mustela destroyeth this serpent and ouercomith him. For to god it pleasith to ordeyne all thinge with remedye and euery creature to haue his peere. And also the deth of this ser¦pent cawsyd by the wesyll is also the deth of the wesyll and that cawsith the greate stenche of the serpent. And this is very trowth but yf this lytyll mustele this we fyll be defensyd with frycacyon and rubbynge of rewe / & fedynge of the same erbe / which meruelously defendith fro poysonde sauowres as saith Aristotle and also auy∣cenne. First therfore this lytyll wesyll goyth and etith of this erbe rewe / though that it be bettyr. And so by ye vertewe of the iuse of this byttir erbe / she goith boldely
agayneher enymye & ouercomith hi. & though this ser∣pent basyliscus be venymous withowt remedye whyl he is leuyng neuerthelesse whan he is brent in to asshis he lesyth the malyce of his venyme / and the asshis of him be thought profitable in the operacyōs of alkymye and especyally in transmutacyons of metallys. This sarpent basiliscus went vnto the see syde in the habyte of a monke lyke as he had bene a relygyous man / and callyd vnto him this for sayde see wolf or luce and sayd. O brodyr forasmoche as thowe arte signyd with the si¦gne of the crosse I am assuryd that thow art a perfight Crysten man. Therfor com to me for I desyre to be ler¦nyd of the crystis faith. And to be crystened / that I may escape the dredefull iugement of God / and to haue fruy¦cyon of euerlastinge ioye. This lucius beholdinge thys serpent and knowinge him spake vnto him and sayde. O thow false ypocryte. A cowle makith not a monke. Nor clothis of relygyon make nat a Relygyo{us} mā / but vertewe and Relygyous conuersacyon. Thy wordys be wycked and dowble / for thew intendist not to be cry¦stened of me / but rathir thow thinkyst to disceyue me & to poyson me / and therfore I wyl not here ye / And thys ssh immediatlye coueryd hym self in the watyr & swā forth and left yt serpent with confusyon and sayde.

To such it is conuenyently sayde by

Wo be to yowe ye false ypocrytes / for ye be made lyke vnto white beryellys or grauys / which apere fayre owtwarde / and within thei be full of Rotyn bonys / of dede men. And yowe in lyke∣wyse apeere owtewarde vnto men goode and ryghtwis But within ye be replete withe auaryce and wycked∣nes. It is redde that whan saynt Hillarye was goone to dispute agayne heretikes. The Deuyll folowid hym in lyknes of a seruaunte / and broughte his Cope aftyr him / and was very seruycehable to him in many other thinges. And as it had bene for compassyon he prayde saynte Hyllari to medle but lytyll watyr with his wy∣ne for cause of his labowre / and he was greable. And af¦tyr that he desyrid hym to drinke pure wyne / withowte any delay of watyr. And so he did. And then he mouyd him to ete flessh / and so he chaunged his penaunce and toke him to flessh. And aftirwarde whan they came to¦gider to a town he tolde saynt hylarye ther was a Re∣lygious woman desyringe to speke with him. And whā they had talkyd togider the holy man was infecte with concupiscens and sawghte the meanys howe for to fo∣lowe his flesshly apetite. But it was shewyd vnto him by the Reuelacyon of God and of saynt Martyne / that it was the workynge of the Deuyll. And saynt Mar∣tyne came & expulsyd hym and shewid him as he was. And thus almyghty God delyueryd Hillary from tem∣ptacyon by the greate merites of saynte Martyne ¶ Of the Sturgyon that went to the see. Dialogo .xlii.
A Sturgyon great and famowse laye in a floode of pade which is in Lom∣bardye / whō all fisshes of pade wor∣shiped and dred / for his great excel∣lence and strength. Wherfor he was lyft vp with in him self / and sayde. What is it vaylehable or worshyp∣full to me to be associate to fisshes of lome degre. For though they referre to me lawde and honowre / they be of no reputacyon. Bettyr it is to me to goo to the greate see / which is so large & spacyows where as be Fisshes without nōbre & great beluys of ye see / & diuers othr / for of thē I shal be magnified for my worthinesse / & I shal be very famous emonge them. and thus saynge he de∣partyd fro the floodes / & swam to the see. & whyle ye he was ther & behelde ye fisshes so great & fierse he repentid sore his doyng for ye ferefull sight of thē. He couetyd gret¦ly to tourn agayn / not knowig what was beste to do for ye gret furyousnes of ye bestes / emōg alothr felch{us} which
as a beaste or a fissh of ye for namyd a see cals most cruell and dredefull came and lokyd vpon this sturgyon and sayde vnto hym. why art not thow shanre faste to go a∣monge them yt be so greate aboue ye / withoute ye lycence of them. Certaynly thou shalt not be vnpunyshed / & with yt same woorde he went to him and destroyd hym and sayde. Euery man chastise him self and amende. By example of him that vaynlye wolde ascende THerfore whan any persone is greate and suffici¦ently honowrid in any place. Stody he not to a∣pere gretter. Nor to be conuersaunt emonge lor∣bis and statis / yt be of excellent power / nor assocyate him self vnto them. For Seneca saith. A small thinge may not longe stonde with a greate. And also he sayth. A shippe is greate in apparence / beynge in the floode. But in ye greate see he semyth but lytyll. The gydynge yt to some shippe is greate / to some is but smal. Ther is a fable yt whan ye frogge sawe a great fat oxe lyinge in ye pasture / she desirid to be as greate as he. And whan this frogge had inflate and blowyn her self / as greate nygh as ye skynne wold hold. She askyd of her children if she were not so great as ye oxe. & they sayd. Noo. The frogge blew her skyn gretter than she didfirst tyme. In¦tending to be as grete as ye oxe / & so her skyn was ouyr straynyd & brast & she dyed / therfore it is not good any man to erecte or lyfte vp him self more then becomythe him yt he perissh not as did the frogge. For Isidore saith All pryde lyeth somoch yt lower. Howe moche he desy∣reth to be high. For why. Aungell for pryde was made a Deuyll / kynge sawle also for the same was made a emonyak and Nabudonosor was made lyke a beaste and all for the synne of pryde.
¶ Of a Lampurn and a watyr∣beaste callyd Crocodilus. Dialogo .xliii. MVrenula as sayth Brito is a fissh lyk to an ele. In Englyssh callyd a Lam∣purn. Vppon a tyme this Lampurn fownde the children of a waterbeaste that is callyd Crokodylus / Which is lyke vnto a lacerte. And whā she had beholde them she kylled them and went forth her waye This beaste Crocodilus whan he was come agayne and sawe his children dede / he was bitterly greuid / and made sorowe more than can be tolde of / and disposyd hī withe all his myghte and power to auenge the deth of his children. Wherfore he went dayly in haberionys & harneys and laye in a wayte for to sle the Lampurn. And vppon a tyme he fownde a cruell serpent and a ve∣nymows and beleuyd that he had be a Lampurn and
went agayne hym and sayde. Thowe cursyd wretche. Nowe shalt not thowe escape. For thowe slewyste my Children cruelly withowte cawse. Therfore nowe I shall slee the and destroye the. To whom this Serpent answerde and sayde. Be thow ware and wele aduysed by my counsell / for I am no Lampurn but a poysonde serpent / and yf thow presume to come to me I shal soo∣ne infecte the / with my venyme. Then sayde the Cro¦kodyll. Thow canste not disceyue me / nor hyde the fro¦me. For thow arte no serpent / but thou art a Lampurn and thow art made as she is in euery pointe. And ther¦fore I shall slee the. And whyle this crocodyll in greate haste / and withe greate wodenesse ran to sle hym. The serpent fortified him self and bote him and poyson de hym and sayde. With him yt is vnknowyn to chyde or to fight Noman owith that intendith to doo right. ANd therfore noman presume to fight withe hym that he knowith not / though he be but of small power. For vertewe restith not alwaye in the great sta¦ture of the person / but rathir in the harte / and in ye wys¦dome of the fighter. For Golye despysyd Dauyd and yitte was he slayne of him. primo Regum decimosepti. Be thowe ware also to fall in batell for Ire Vengeaun¦ce or Couoytise. For he that is irefull trowythe that he may doo more then all othir / and therfore his power is the lesse / as Seneca sayth. Euermore the wrathfull man thinkyth he may doo more then he maye. And he also sayth. The irefull man is oftyn forgetfull of the lawe. Wherfore the philosofre sayth. The lawe behol¦dith the irefull man in his wrath. But he in his wrath seyth not the lawe. Therfore wrathe is to be departyd from the soule / for it is sayd Prouerbiorum .xxvii. Ire
hath no mercye. And therfore a iuge shulde neuer pro∣ferre any sentence while he is in ire / or mouyd withe wrath. It is redde in the cronicles of Themperowris of Rome / that whan Otto the first had ordeyned a gre¦te feaste to his Princes and lordis in the hyghe solemp∣nyte of eftyr. Before or they were sette / the sonne of a greate Prynce beynge but a babe and of tendre age / of veray chyldehode toke a messe fro the Table. Wher∣fore the sewer in greate angre smote the chylde withe his fyste and ouirthrewe hym. The mastyr of the chyl¦de that seynge and beynge greately mouyd with ire. Smote the sewer and kyllyd him. Wherwith the Em¦perowre was greatelye disspleasyd / and in his angre wolde haue dampnyd hym withowte any audience. But he Caught the Emperower and threwe hym to grownde and began to choke hym. And the Emperowr whan he was delyuered withe greate difficulte fro his hondis. Comaundid hym to be kepte / and sayde that he hym self was culpable and fawtye / that he gaue not dewe honowre vnto the hyghe feste / Wherfore he commaundid hym frely to be let goo and to haue lybertye. ¶ Of a Luce and a Tenche.

VPpon a tyme ther was a Fissher that fisshed / and hydde his hookis sotellye / and shewid vnto the fissh the delycy∣ows bayte / a Luce and a Tenche be∣holdynge the plesaunte bayte / desyrid it greatlye. But the Luce was wytty and sayd to the Tenche. This mete semyth very good and delicate / but neuerthelesse I trowe that it be putte here to disceyue Fisshes. Therfor let vs forsake it / that we be not loste by the fowle apetyte of glotonye. Trin¦cha than spake and sayde. It is but folye to forsake soo goode a morsell and so delycyous / for a lytle vayne dred For rathir I my self shal at taste of it first / & dyne with it with great plesure and swettenesse. And Tarye thou and beholde my chaunce. And whyle that she swalo∣wyd in the mete / she felte the hokys that were hydds. And she wolde fayne haue retournyd bakwarde. But the Fissher pluckyd her vp to him, and the Luce fledde
swyftlye and sayde thus. Of othirmennys sorowe corected mote webe. Euyr that fro parell we mowe escape free. SO we owe to be ware by correccyon and hurte of othirmen / as sayth Caton. The hurte of thiney∣bowre mote chastise the. and Seneca saith. Goode it is to espye what is to be lefte by the punysshment of othir and also he sayth. a wyseman amendith his own fawt by consyderacyon of an other mannys fawte. and also the same clerke saith / he is wyse that can disspose well his besynes / and beware of harm to him selfe by exem∣ple of othirmen / as Isope rehersith in his Fablis. That a Lyon was syke and faynte and laye in his ca∣ue. To whome there came dyuers beastis to vysyte hym in his infirmyte / and whan he sawe auauntage / and they were nere hym / he cawght them and ete them at laste came the Foxe vnto him for cawse of vysitaci∣on / and stode all withowte / before the mowth of the ca∣ue / and wolde not entyr in to the caue for he dradde to come nere the Lyon. To whome the Lyon sayde. Co∣me hyder my dere sustre that we maye frendely and lo∣uynglye talke togider. The Foxe answerde and sayde thus to the Lyon. Certaynly I espye well / the fotynge of dyuers bestis goynge inwarde. But I see noon Co∣mynge owtewarde. and therfore pardone me. For I wil come no nere. ¶ Of a Scalye Fyssh callyd Regyna / and a wa∣tyrsarpent callyd Idrus. Dialogo .xlv.
THere is a Fissh callyd Regina and it is a scaly fissh / and takyn in the floodes. And she is cal∣lyd Regina of a Verbe. Rego / is / that sygnifi∣eth in Englyssh to rule or to gouerne. For she rulyth her self very wele. A waterserpent cal¦lyd Idrus hauynge many heedis cam vppon a tyme to this Fissh and sayde. O Regina most fayre to me before all othir fisshes thow arte in greate fauowre / and most interly belouyd. And therfore I wyll be knytts vnto ye and sacryd by holy matrimony / and for that cawse fren¦dely at this tyme I am come vnto the. To whome Re¦gyna answerde and sayde thus. That maye not be. For it is not conuenient. It is wryttyn Ecclesiastici .xiii. Euery beaste louyth his owne lykenesse / and so e∣uery man louyth his owne Neybowre. Euery thinge that berithe lyfe desyreth to be conioynyd to his assem∣bleable. And euery man shall be assocyate to his owne symylitude. Therfore and forasmoche as thow art not
of my kynrede nor of my kynde thow shalt neuyr be so∣cyate vnto me. This serpent Idrus seyng that he was derydyd and deceyuyd of his purpose retournyd home∣warde agayne with confusyon and sayde. I am confusyd vtterlye and playnly forsake. My ioye is for euir goon / myrth shall I neuyr make. EVery Crysten man shulde soo answer to the De∣uyll whan he temptith hym / for he is the olde ser∣pent more subtyle than any thinge lyuynge that is vndir heuyn as it is wryttyn Genesis tertio. And therfore thus shulde euery creature saye vnto hym. Go thow fro me / for thowe arte not of my kynde. Nor thow arte noon of them that shal be sauyd. And if thou doo thus he cannotte abyde. For it is wryttyn Iacoby .iiii. Resyste ye the Deuyll and he shall fle fro yowe / and the Apostill sayth. Be ye stronge in batell and fight ye with the olde serpent. Therfore we must fight agayne hym and we shall haue victorye. For he is but feble a∣gayne them that wyl with stonde hym / as Isidore saith The Deuyll is dredefull in the sight of them that be worldely and flesshly dyssposyd. But in the sight of thē that be electe and godlye the drede of hym is vyle / and not set bye. As by an example is shewyd in vitis pat. That somtyme ther was a brodir of Relygion that re∣tournyd vnto the worlde agayne / and ther he spottyd hym selfe withe lecherye and withe othir vyces / and became seruaunte to allmaner of synnes and soo con∣tynewyd longe. but by Grace he repentyd hym / and was verye penytent / and soorye / and lyuyd stray∣ghtlye / in a Sepulchre / or Charnell hows / And ther he chastised him self yn dyuers maners with great
penaunce longe season. and fendes temptyd him oftyn∣tymes and promysyd him rychesse and bodyly plesure / and at the laste they bete hym tyll he was nyghe dede and whan the fendis sawe him stedfastlye continew in prayer and wepinge / they cryed owte and sayde. Thow hast ouercome vs monke thow hast ouercome vs / and so they fled all awaye. and the goodman remembringe the malyce and wyckednesse of them purposyd verylye in his mynde rathir to dye than to obaye vnto the fen∣des. and so was he chaungyd fro synne and made lyke vnto an aungell in vertewe / to goode Example of ma∣ny folkes &c. Of a Fyssh callyd a Carpe / and a Fissh callyd Tymallus. Dialogo .xlvi.
IT happyd in a greate solempne Feste. Fisshes of the floode walkyd togidre af¦tyr dynar in greate Tranquillyte and peace / for to take ther recreacyon and so lace / but the Carpe began to trowble the Feste erectynge hym self by pryde & saynge / I am worthy to be lawdyd aboue all othir / for my flessh is delicate and swete more then it can be tolde of. I haue not be nourrisshed nothir in dychesse / nor ston dynghwatyrs nor pondes / but I haue be brought vppe in the floode of the greate garde. Wherfore I owe to be Prynce and regent amonge all yowe. Ther is a Fissh callyd Tymassus / hauinge his Name of a flowre / for Timus is callyd a flowre. And this Tymallus is a fissh of the see / as saith Isidore / Ethimologiarum .xii. and all thoughe that he be fauoureable in sight and de¦tectable in taste / yit moreouir the Fyssh of hym sines∣lyth swete lyke a flowre and geuith a plesaunte odour And so this Fyssh Tymallus / heringe this saynge of the Carpe had greate scorne of him and sterte forth & sayde. It is not as thou sayste. For I shine more bright then thowe and excede the in odowre and relece. Who may be comparyd vnto me / for he that tyndith me hath a greate tresowre. If thow haue thy dwellynge oonly in the watir of garde. I haue myn abydynge in many large floodes. And so emonge them were greate stryuis and contencyons. Wherfore the feste was tournyd in to great trowble / For some fauowryd the parte of the one and some of the othir / so that be lykly hode there shuld haue growen greate my schefe emonge them. For euery of them began to snak at othir & wolde haue torn eche other on smale pecys. Ther was monge all othir a fissh callyd Truta euyr mouyd to breke stryfe. And soo thys
trowte forasmoche as she was agid / and wele lernyd she spake and sayde. Bredryn it is not good to stryue & fight for vayne lawdatowris and praysers. For I pray¦se not my self though some personis thinke me worthy to be commendid / for it is wryttyn. Themowth of an othir man mote commende the and not thyn owne. For all commendacyon and lawde of hym self is fowle in ye mouth of the spekar. Therfore bettyr hit is that those that prayse them self goo togider to the see iuge that is the Dolphyn which is a iuste iuge and a rightfull and dredinge God for he shall rightfully detertermyn this mater. This counsell plesyd them well and forth went these twayn togider vnto the Dolphyn and shewyd to him all ther myndes / and to ther power comendid thē¦self. To whom the dolphyn sayde. Children I neuyr sawe yowe tell this tyme for ye be alway hydde in the floodes and I am steringe in the greate wawys of the see. Wherfore I cannot gyue ryghtfull sentence betwe¦ne yowe / but yf I first assaye and make a taste of yowe And thus saynge he gaue a sprynge and swalowyd them in both two and sayde. Noman owith hym self to commende. Aboue all other laste he offende. ANd so some folke lawde and commende them self and ther owne dedys desyringe to erecte and lyft vp them self by pryde and vanyte aboue all othir. But lowlye people and rightfull despyse them self. And gre¦gory saith. Then owr workys growe and increce by me ryte when they be leste set bye in owre owne myndes. Wherof it is wryttyn. Iob .xxxi. If I kysse my honde with myn owne mowth / that is a greate wyckednesse. He kyssyth his owne honde that praysith his owne de∣dys. Therfore Verite and Trowthe / hym self techyth
vs saynge. Luce .xvii. Whan ye haue perfourmyd all thinge that is commaundyd yowe / saye ye. We haue doone as we owght to do and yitte be we vnprofitable seruauntis. It is in Fables that byrdes fownde a neste Ornate of Rooses and Flowres / and the Egle Kynge of all byrdes sayde that the neste shulde be geuyn to the moost noble byrde. And he cawsyd all the byrdes of he∣uyn to be callyd togider / and askyd of all them whiche was the mooste fayre byrde. And the Cuckowe answer¦de and sayde. The Cuckowe. And the Egle demaun∣did which was the strengest byrde / and the Cuckowe sayde I. And the Egle was greuyd and sayde. Thow vnhappy Cuckowe thow euyr praysist thy self and ne¦uerthelesse thow arte not fayrest / dor swyftest. Nor strē¦gest. Nor thy songe is not very swete. But thowe euyr cryest oone crye. And therfore I gyue this sentence of dā∣pnacyon agaynst the / that thou  haue this neste nor noon other. In lykewyse many folkes euyr prayse and commende them selfe and synge allwaye oon songe lyke the Cuckowe. ¶ Of the Frogge and the Crabbe. Dialogo .xlvii. THe Frogge vppon a tyme whan she sawe the Crabbe swymmynge by the watersyde spake and sayde. What is he this so fowle & vncom¦ly yt is so bold to trouble my watyr. Forsomoch as I am mighty & strōge both in watyr & lond I shal go & dryue him away. And aftir this saying she made a lepe as though she wold haue oppressyd ye crab∣be & sayde. O thow wretche why arte not thow shame faste to entyr in to my restynge place. Arte not thowe
Confusyd to  the watyr that is so fayre & bright whan thow a so fowle soo blacke and soo odyows. The Crabbe as he is vsyd to do went euyr bakwarde saynge to the Frogge. Syster saye not soo. For I desyre to haue thy loue / and to be at peace withe the. Ther∣fore I praye the entyr not vppon me withe vyolence / And the Frogge seynge hym goynge bakwarde beleuid that he had doone soo for fere of her. Wherfore she begā to greue him more and more / both with woordes and de¦dys / saynge withdrawe not thy self thowe moost fowle for thow mayst not escape. For this same daye I shall fede Fysshes with the. And euyn forthwith that same woorde she made a lepe wyllynge to sle the Crabbe. The Crabbe seynge the greate iubardye and that he cowde not escape. He tournyd him self and disposyd him to batell and caught the Frogge with his cleys and bo¦te her and plukkyd her to smale pecys and sayde.
He that to batell is compellyd to goo. Let him fight manly with his mortall foo. EVery creature owith as ferforth as euyr he can or maye to the vttermost of his power to fle fro batell and stryfe. But yf he cannot eschew it by no meane / or he shuld suffre him self to dye or to be slay¦ne he maye to his power fight and with stonde his eny∣myes. Dauyd the composytor of Psalmis desyred to be crepte and delyueryd frome suche personys and sayde. Psalmo. lvii. O good Lorde / delyuer thow me from thē that ryse agayne me. And also he prayde all suche to be destroyed saynge. Psalmo. lxii. Destroye thowe suche people as loue batell and fyghtynge. We owe not oonly to fight for owr owne cause. But also for the diffence of owre frendes / and especially of fader and moder / and for the commune profyte to be sauyd as Valery shewith in lib .v .cap .iiii. that whan kynge Daryus had entrid ye coostis of the contray of scythyns. The people of the sa¦me contraye sent to hym / and sayde that they myghte suffir the destruccyon of both ther vynes and cornys. But and if they towchid the sepulchris of ther frendes / then shulde they fele the power of the scythins / and the strength of them. For thei for diffence therof and for the commune wele were redy to dye. So we ow to loue our frendis and contray somoche / that for the conseruacyon of them in tyme of nede we shall iubard owre lyuis. Va¦lery also tellyth libro .v .cap .vii. That whan Codrus kynge of Athenys / was mouid by his enymys to batell He had an Answer of Apollyne. That his oste shulde haue victorye yf he wolde suffre him self to be slayne of his enymyes. The whiche answer whan his enymyes knewe / they comaundid that noman shulde towche the kynge. Then he chaungid his clothinge & went agayn
his enymyes and mette with a knyght and smote hym with his wepyne / and he fell vppon hym and kyllyd hī And whan the bodye of the kynge was seyn dede / and knowen the enymyes fled and left all theyr goodes be∣hynde them. Remembringe that it was before sayde yt they shuld be destroyde. ¶ Of a Fissher and a lytyll Fissh. Dialogo .xlviii A Fissher as he Fisshed he cawght a lytell fissh and whan he wolde haue kylled him he spake and sayde. O gentyll Fissher haue mercye vppon me. for yf thou kyl me thou shalt ha¦ue but lytel auauntage of me. But & if thou wilt suffre me to go fre and delyuer me from this daunger & captiuite I promise to God and to the / that I shall cawse the to haue greate
wynnynge. for I shal retourne vnto the daylye withe greate multitude of fisshes and I shall lede them in to thy nettis. To whō the fissher sayd. How shall I mowe knowe the emonge so many fisshes. Then sayd yt fissh. Cut of a lytell of my tayle that thou mayst know me e∣mong al othir. The fissher gaue credēce to his woordis and cut of his tayle & let him go. This lytel fissh was euer vncurteys / for contrary to his promyse he lettyd the fissher as oftyn as he shuld fissh / and withdrewe ye fisshes from him and sayd. faders and worshipfull seny∣ours be ye ware of that deceyuar for he deceyuyd me / & cut of my tayle / and so shall he serue you if ye be not wa¦re. And yf ye beleue not me / beleue his workis that ape¦re vpon me. And thus saynge the fissh shewyd thē his tayle yt was cut. wherfor the fisshes abhorryd ye fyssher and fled from him in al possible haste. The fissher vsid no more fysshinge. wherfore he leuyd in great pouerte. Of fortune it happid so that a longe while aftir the fis∣sher cawght agayne the same fissh emonge othir. And whan he knew him he kyllyd him cruelly and sayde. He that hath a good turn and is vncurteys agayn It is veray rightfull that he be therfore slayne TRulye many be soo vnkynde that they euermore yelde euyll for good. To whom it is sayde Prou .xvii. He yt yeldith badnesse for godenesse / malyce & cursidnesse shal neuer departe from the hows of hī. for that is a greate vnkyndnesse and an vnworthy rewar¦de of goode dedys. wherof spekyth Barnarde & saith. Vnkyndnesse is enymye to ye sowle / destruccyon of good dedys. Ingratitude is enymy of ye soule a brinnyg wind drying ye wel of al pyete / ye dew of al mercy / ye floodes of all grace / Agayne vnkynde men maye be reportyd the example of the pouer Townysshman that dayly went
to the woode with his asse / which also founde a dragon oppressyd vndir a tre / and he delyuered him frome that perell. And aftirwarde the dragon wolde haue ete the asse / saynge all the grettest seruices be oftyn tymes loste But this villane had counsell of ye foxe / which brought the dragon agayne there he was first and sauyd bothe the man and the asse. Also ther is a nothir example of Gerarde tenersi whiche was in maner of a foole / and had nothinge in substaunce of goodes. but he had a son∣ne / and whan he sawe moche people goynge to the Em∣perowre berynge hym greate gyftes / he sayde withe yn him self / I shall alsoo goo to the Emperowre and pre∣sent hym with giftes ▪ suche as shall please him / And ye first that he fownde was a beaste callyd Centaurus. The which beaste in the nether parties is an horse / and in the ouerpartyes it is lyke a man / and he is swyfte in rynnynge as an horse. And than he toke a bere and ode vppon him and gaue them both to the Emperowre as of the parte and sonde of his lorde and fader. To whom the Emperour sent great giftes agayne / and made him passingly riche. And aftyr this immediatly this yong∣man / the sonne of this Gerarde / faynyd him self to be dede / and sent worde to his Fader to proue what moone he wolde make for him / and he prouyd that his Fader toke no care for hym / and therfore he set the lesse pryce by his Fader / and thought him very vnkynde. wher∣fore sayth Gregory. He is not worthy to haue gyftys geuyn that referrith not thankynges for theke yt hath bene geuyn. And saynt Augustyn saith. Tho thinges that God gaue to them that were louynge he toke fro them that were vnkynde.
¶ Of the Egle and all othir byrdes / and the lyon and all othir beastis. Dialogo .xlix. VPpon a tyme the Egle was acompa∣nyed and strenghthid withe almaner of byrdes and toke ther stondingis and pight ther fyldes and faugt agayn the Lyon / and almaner of beastis. And soo dayly encresid the nombre of both par¦tyes / and went fierslye to batell euery kynde agayne o∣thir. And whyle these batellys thus had continuyd. The Foxe callyd the swalowe vnto him and sayde. Nowe is the tyme present / that we maye redeme owre self owte of captiuite and daunger. For we maye see vē¦geaunce of owre princes that haue dominacyon and ru∣le ouir vs / let vs doo wysely / and we maye be polycye ordayne that they togider shall fighte them self and e∣uery of them shall sle othir. And thus to doo the swa∣lowe
consentyd / and flewe straygth to the Egle & ma∣gnified her greatlye and sayde. Thou arte Queene of all byrdes and Emperesse / and if thow wylt take hede to my counsell thowe shalt be princesse / and lady of all beastis. The Egle consentyd and promysyd to kepe se¦crete this matere. The swalowe retournyd agayne to the Foxe / and made suche ordinaunce with her & withe othir / that the Egle shulde fighte withe the Lyon / and nomo but oonly they twayne. And which of them that myght optayne and be victoriows / shuld be prince and Ruler both of byrdes and beastis. and whan they were stryuynge in ther batell / the Egle spake and sayde. O Noblesse Leonyne yf thow take hede / we be disceyuyd be false consellowrs. For they hope to be delyueryd of our dominacyon and lordshippe / and for that cawse they mene and stere vs to batell. But certeynly hit is bettyr that eche of vs haue dominacyon and rule ouyr his own kynde / then that we shulde shamefully sle euerych othr be ther frawdes and sotylteys. The Lyon beleuyd the saynges of the Egle / for he vnderstoode veryly that it was trew / and so were they acordyd togider as frendis for cuyr and sayde. Wycked seductours in dede they be. That false counsell geue iuyll mote they the. PRinces therfore owe to be ware of suche / yt they be not lyghtlye mouyd in them self for wordys nor talys though they be subtellye tolde / for ther is ma¦ny a false deceyuer. And Seneca saith. Be thow mouid at the dede doynge / and not at the herynge of the woor¦de. Euerye creature owith to kepe hym self wisely and to beware before that he be not disceyuyd of false coun∣sellowres
/ as it is wrytten & commawndyd Prouerbi .xxvii. From a badde counselloure kepe well thi sowle. A prince owith to haue vnderstondinge of parellys ro∣wnde abowte him. And especyally of seduccyon and dis¦ceyuynge of flaterers. There be many flaterers lyke vnto Marmaydes which disceyue many by ther swe∣te voyces. Of whom it behouith especyallye to be wa∣re / and to vnderstonde ther deceytefulnesse. Wherfore a philosofre callyd Sensippus kynsman of Plato sayde vnto one that flaterde him. Thowe flaterer be thowe styll. For thow profitiste not. For I knowe thyn adula¦cyon / in the best wise. And therfore thowe canste not be∣gile me. ¶ Of the Egle that cyted alma¦ner of Byrdes. Dialogo. l.
THe Egle cyted allmaner of byrdes and wilde fowles to chapitle. And whyle they were to¦gider and correctyd offencis. Sodeynlye ther came honters and byrdetakers and stretchid owte ther nettis and ordeynyd ther snarys to kache of the byrdes. The Egle beholdinge this and knowinge the great perell / by her cryers cawsid opyn∣lye to be cried that all wild fowles and byrdes shuld fo∣lowe the banere of the Egle / and that they shulde way¦te vppon her and flye togider yf they desyred to escape / and be owte of daunger. And so they that were obedyēt and flewe forth with the Egle escapid and were owte of parell. But there were some that were glotonows & inobedyent / and they lokyd on the mete and couetyd to haue therof. And soo they flewe into the nettys where they were faste masshyd and snaryd and then they cry∣ed wretchidlye and sayde. He that mekelye will not obaye. Shall perissh wyckydlye it is no naye. Therfore the vice of inobedyence is to be esche¦wyd. For inobedyence cawsith deth and curse in this present lyfe / and perpetuall payne in tyme comynge. wherfore it was sayde vnto Adam. Gen iii. Forasmoche as thowe hast eten of the tre of the whiche I commaundid the not to ete. Cursyd be the erthe in thy worke / and it shall Germyn and bere vnto ye thor∣nys and brerys. It was also sayde vnto kynge Sawle as it is wrytten primo .xv. For becawse that thow hast castawaye the woorde of God and not bene obedyent to his comaundment. He hath cast the away yt thou shalt no lenger be a kynge. Wherfore also Barnarde saith. The vyce of inobedience is veray greate / for Aungell lofte heuyne. Adam paradyce. Saule his kyngdome.
Salomon the loue of Godde / and all for inobedience. And Valery saith in his secounde boke puttynge an ex¦ample howe fadirs before tyme punysshed ther childrē for not kepinge knyghtly discipline. Aurelius cawsed his sonne to be punyshed amonge fotemen / for he kepte not his commaundement / which correccyon in tho day∣es was of the grettest humyliacion that cowde be. It is also redde in cronicis Romanorum that whan Iulius Cesar had passid the space of .v. yeris in subduynge of enymyes though he had oftyntymes bene victoriows. Neuerthelesse the dewe honowre which he was wonde to haue was denyed hym at his cominge home / and he was not suffirde to entyr thecyte forsomoche as he had Taryed so longe aftyr the space of .iii. yeris which was prefixte vnto hym. Of a byrde Callyd Herodius / and of the kyte Dialogo. li.
HErodius is a dyrde of all byrdes flying most cruell and most rapaunte and gretter than any byrde / the which subduyth and ouerco∣myth the Egle as sayth the glose vpon this verse of the psalter. Herodii domus &c. This Herodius occupied the ayer fleynge abowte. But the kyte began to whistle aftyr him and sayde. Abyde a while thow wycked caytif for I shall make ye ballyd / for thowe desyrist dominacy on ouyt all byrdes But I shall my self auenge all byrdes vpon the. This Royall byrde this Herodius / fleynge in the ayre toke no cure of the lewde woordis of the kyte. But he cowde not be styll / but began to reherse the woordes agayne. Wherfore this Herodius was greuyd and wold no len¦ger suffer hym / but swyftely descendid downe vppon ye kyte and with his cleys pluckyd owte his guttis / and kyllyd him and sayde. He that wyll fight and stryue with the stronge Perisshith many tymes / & sekyth his deth amōge THerfore we maye well cōsidre that it is no smal parell to be vnrasonablye worde full agayn thē that be myghty / or to vexe them to moche / as it is wrytten Ecclesia .viii. Stryue thow not with a my∣ghty man / leste that thow fall in to the hondes of him Wherof Isope tellyth a fable that vpon a tyme a wolf drank of a ryuer and a Lambe also drank of the same ry¦uer lower and in an othir place. And the wolf lyfte vp his voyce and spake to the Lambe / and sayde. Thowe trowbly st my watyr. To whom the Lambe answerde and sayde. My Lorde I do no wrong to yowe. Nor trou¦ble the watyr. The wolf sayde. Thretyst thowe me /
Wotyst not thow what I did to thi fadyr not yitte .vi∣wekys paste. To whom the Lambe spake and sayde. I haue not leuyd so longe. Then the wolf cryed lowde & sayde. Sayste thow soo thow vyllane / and strayght fel vppon him and deuowrid him. So do the myghty men of the worlde to them that be vndir / for withoute occa∣sion they deuowre them and destroye them. Therfor it is oftyn sayde. Ther lakkyth neuer occasion to a lorde / or to a man of greate power. ¶ Of the Crane that wolde flye to the sonne. Dialogo. lii.
I Am as fayre and as great as an Egle sayde the prowde Crane / whan he see the Egle flee to the Sonne / for to behol¦de the brightnes of it / Wherfore I wyl flye vppe to the Sonne and beholde it withowt irreuerberacyon of myn Ien / as doth the Egle. And aftirwarde I shall be magnified as she is. And whan she had exaltid her self to the ster¦rye she began to waxe wery / & was passid her strength and yit she came not to the Sonne. Nor alsoo for pryde she wolde not descende / but excedynge her power she la¦bowrid vppe warde. Wherfore she was gretely greuyd and not hable to gide her self / nor to flye to the Sonne / and therfore she fell without remedy and sayde. Who that agayne myght vpwarde will tende. Agayne his owne wyll shal downwarde descende IN lykewise manyon that be full of elacyon and pryde coueyte and desire to be aboue all othir. And forasmoche as pryde euer hath a fall agay¦ne ther wyll they shall be humiliate. For he that wyll exalte him self / shall be made lowe. Luc .xiiii. Wherfo∣re Bernarde sayth. He that exaltith him self as moche as he maye / shall be subduyd as moche as God maye. And saynt Augustyn saith. If thow extoll and lyfte vp thy self / God shall throwe the downe. If thou meke thi selfe. God shall exalte the. For it is the sentence of god hym self which cannot be made more nor lesse. He that exaltith him self shall be lowyd. And also Leo the Po∣pe rehersith / Bredryn saith he ye maye se a great myra¦cle. God is mooste excellent and highe. If thow lyft vp thy self he fleyth fro the. If thowe meke thy self he des∣cendith and comith downe to the. Orosius tellith in his fyfte boke / that Valery the eyght Emperowr aftir Ne¦ro
for his pride and infidelite he reysid perseeucyon in ye seruauntes of cryste / through all the worlde / couetynge in his corrupte mynde / to destroye the fayth of cryste / & to trede it vnderfote. wherfore he commaundid to sle al them that namyd that most gloryows name of cryste. And therfore whan he shulde fight with Sapore kyng of Perce / he was ouercome and takyn with all his ho∣ste / and God delyueryd him in to the hondes of Sapo∣re / for his greate pryde / and he was seruaunte vn∣der him as longe as he leuyd. And as oftyn as the said Sap lepte on his horse / he trade first on the backe of this Valerye as he laye prostrate before him / and then he toke his horse and rode forth. ¶ Of a byrde callyd sterla that toke an hare. Dialogo. liii.
THer is a fyrde callyd Sterla and is lyke a cra∣ne / and she hath a great byll and a perylows. This byrde toke an hare with her byll. Butte thowgh she were hongrye / she wolde not ete this praye that she had takyn herself / but say∣de thus within her owne mynde. I wyll shewe to othir dyuersse / so worthyly that I haue spedde / and so excel∣lent a game that I haue takyn that I maye be magni¦fyed of them that shal se it. And whan she had brought it to the mustre of byrdes. The grettest byrdes and strē¦geste couetid to haue it / and toke it awaye and lefte no parte to her that had cawght it. Therfore Sterla con∣tynuyd styll hungrye / with greate payne and heuynes∣se and sayde in this wyse. He that wyll booste and shewe that he hath. Shall haue noon auantage but somtyme great scath SO manyon that be vayngloriows wyll shew ther goodis to othir folkes to be the more collawdid & worshippete. But Gregory saith. He desyreth to be robbyd that opynlye berith his tresowre in the wayt Ther be also many othir that coueyte to shewe all ther goode workys to euery person about them / to ye intents that they shulde be knowyn. To whom saynt Augu∣styn spekyth and saith. Hyde thy good workys as moch as thou mayst. And yf thou maye not hyde them all. Let within the be a wyll to hyde it if thou cowdest. And Gregory sayth. A good worke mote so be doone opyn∣lye / that the good intent therof maye be hid secretly. Also it is wryttyn. He is oppressyd with the beaste that he hath slayne him self / that reioycith openlye of the goode dedis that he hath doone. Isope tellyth in his fa∣blys that vpon a tyme the Wolf caught a kydde that was tendre and fatte. The kydde spake to the wolfe &
sayde. Be mery and ioye with greate ioye. that thowe haste so goode a kydde in thy kepinge. But or euyr thou ete me. I praye the to synge a mery songe / and I shall dawnce whyle thou syngest. And forthwith the wolfe sange plesawntlye / and the kydde lepte about and dan¦cyd luftelye. And soo by that noyse all the doggis that were nyghe came togider and made a greate assawt vp¦pon the wolfe / and folowid hym / and compellyd hym to leue the kydde behynd him. And so the kydde fledde and was sauyd. This exemple mouyth and counsellyth e∣uery man to occupye his goodes withowte booste and in secrete wyse. ¶ Of the Strucyon and the Si∣reurgyn. Dialogo. liiii.
STrucyo is a greate byrde and a stronge / & largelye fedyrde / and wyngid. And neuerthe¦lesse she maye not flye high for wekenesse of her wynges. Ther was somtyme a Stru∣cyon sufficyently faire and beawtifull the which had wynges very stronge and com∣lye / but in tho same wynges ther were two fedirs con∣traryouslye stondinge and lettynge her flight. Wherof she oftyn tymes was not merye. And for to haue reme¦dy she went to a Sireurgyn and sayde. I am sufficient∣ly worshipfull and goodely / but I haue two fedirs re∣tournyd bacwarde. I wyl that thou smyte them of. for they become me nought. This Sireurgyn smote of theke two fedyrs and anoynted the wynges with suche an oyntment that all the other feddyrs fell awaye. Wherfore she was impotent and myght neuer flye af∣tir. This Strucyo was sorye and made greate mour∣ninge and wepte tell she dyed for sorowe and sayde. As Godde hath ordeynyd vs in euery pointe. Let vs continewe and not owre self disioynte. SO some personys that be curyows and vayne. Thowghe they be made of ther maker sufficient∣lye and wele / they Referre not to him dewe honowre & thankyngis therfor. But rather if they haue any faute or spotte in ther bodye / they stodye and deuyse how thei maye amende it. Not takynge suche cure of the spottys of ther sowlys / howe they shulde hele them. But as Saynte Augustyn saith. The spowse that is inuisible desireth not the owtwarde beawte of the bodye / but ye inwarde beawte of the sowle. Therfore it is wryttyn. Prouerb .xxxi. Grace is deceyuable / and beaute is but vayne / that is to saye worldely grace and beawte. Of suche beawte saynt Augustyn saith. Beholde al thing
about man / and it is beawtefull and fayre / excepte man hym self / which is veray fowle. Wherof it is tolde that ther was sometyme a kynge that made a greate feste to his lordes and estatis / and ther was no cornar lefte in the hows but it was coueryd with purple and withe othir precyows clothis. And ther was a philosofre pre∣sent. And whan he wolde haue spette / and fownde no place bare. He spette in the kyngis face. And whan the kynges seruauntis wolde haue ledde hym to hanginge for that same dede / the kynge wolde not suffre thē / but askyd of the philosofre why he did soo. And he sayde. I sawe euery place full of Golde and Syluer / of purple also and precyows stonys / and therfore I spet in to the kynges face / which is replete withe flessh and fatnesse for me thought I sawe not a more vnclene place. And whan the kynge harde this saynge of the philosofre / he was greatly compuncte and humiliate in him self. for they that araye them self with Golde and othir orna∣mentis be sone rewyd of ther beawte / if they lacke ther garnamentis / as Isope shewith in his fablis. That a Crowe that was blacke and vncomely vppon a tyme went to a weddynge / but or euyr she entyrde the bryde∣hows / she toke of euery byrde a feddyr / and made her self gay / and she was veray fayre not be kynde / but be craste. And whan she shulde goo in to the hows where the weddynge was holde / all othir byrdes meruaylyd of the beawte of the crowe. And at the laste all the byr∣des came to her of whom she had stolyn the fedyrs / and euery byrde toke his owne fedir fro the crowe / and soo she remaynyd blacke / and fowle as she was wonde to doo. It happid also at pareys in a generall processyon / yt an ape pluckyd from a ladys hede a browdering of othr folkys heris / which she bare before all the people. And
she apetd fowle / and without herys / lyke the Crowe whan other byrdes fedirs were goon / and this fortu∣nyd be rightfull iugement of God. ¶ Of the Faulcon and the cocke. Dialogo. lv. A Knyghte ther was somtyme yt hadde a Royall Faulcon withe the whiche he greatly reioycyd / whiche he bare daylye vppon his gloue / and norys∣sned him delycyowslye. Vppon a ty∣me this knyght let flye this hawke .in to the eyre couetynge to reclayme hym and to call him agayne to his honde. And whan he had bene fro hym a whyle / the knyghte whistlyd yt he shulde come agayne / but he wolde not descende in no wyse. A prowde cocke was ther dwellynge and seynge this began to exalte him self and sayd. What do I that
euer hiderto haue leuyd lyke a wretche / and seke my le¦uynge fowle and with greate labowre in the donge and in the myre. Am not I a fayre byrde / and as large as a Fawlcon. Certaynly I shal flye vppon the gloue and be fed with the delycyows mete of my lorde. And whan he was flow yn vpon the gloue. The knyght was glad for he was thowhtfull for his faulcon / and caught the Cocke and kyllyd him lyghtlye / and shewyd a legge of him to the faulcon & callyd him therwith / to his hon¦de. The faulcon seynge so delicate flessh / and desyringe to haue it / descendid ioyfully to it and sayde. It is no wyisdom eleuacyon to make. For him that is wele / but kepe the same state TRuly euery man shuld so do / that is to saye to con¦tinewe in his degre / & not to lyft vp his Ien ther to that is not conuenyent to his state. Wherfor it is wrytten Eccle .iii. Ordeyne thou maner to thy wys∣dom / seke thou not tho thinges that passe thi degre / no serche thou not thinges that excede thy strength ferre and Seneca saith. Seke that that thow mayst fynde. Lerne that that thou mayst can. Isope tellyth that a worthy man had a lytell whelpe / and a sportefull / and also he had an asse. The asse he sent to myl that he shul¦de bere corn and do othir greate workys / the lytel whel¦pe playde at home with his mastir. And somtyme hys mastir fedde him of his owne dissh. The asse seynge yt he labowrid so sore and was wery daylye / and that the whelpe was fostirde with good mete / and with greate cherissinge / he sayde to him self. This whelpe doth no¦thinge / but tredith vppon my mastir with his fete / and lyckyth hī with his tong / & he is gretly belouid. Wher for I wil assay / & if I can do so as he doth. & so this asse came in sodeynly before his mastir and lyft vppe bothe
his forfete / and sette them vppon his mastirs shulders and sange in his vncowth and straunge manere. The Lorde was greatly aferde of him and cried owt / and his seruauntis came anone with clubbys and stauys / and all to bete the sely asse. And then he remembrid him / & sayde. It had be bettyr for me to haue lefte my sporte / & to haue bene styll than to do as I did. For I haue won∣ne nothinge therby sauf greate strokys. Wherfore we be tawght by this example that a man owith neuyr to attempte to do that thinge / which he cannot perfourme of veray kynde / as an autowre saith. Noman assaye to do / that kyndely maye not be doon / for a foole displea∣sith when he thinkyth to please. ¶ Of a byrde callyd an Astur whiche sent for an othir byrde callyd Caridrius. Dialogo. lvi.
IN the ayre the Crane was pursewyd of a byrde that is callyd Astur / and at the laste Astur ouyrthrewe him. But neuerthelesse this Crane with his lon¦ge byll smote this astur and gaue hym a dedly wounde. astur this birde felyn∣ge hym self sore woundid / sent forth messengers and gre¦te gyftes vnto a byrde callyd Caridrius seyng. O thou leche and helper both of sowles and bodyes / come to me and hele my woundes / and I shall rewarde the to thy pleasure. This Caridrius as saith Papie is a byrde al whyte of the which bowellys make fore eyne to be hole and the propirte of this byrde is that if a man shall le∣ue / he wyll drawe nere to him▪ and if he shall dye he wil flye from him. Wherfore he knewe well that this astur shuld dye breuely / and for that cawse he wolde not goo to hym but sayde in this wise. Of them that shall perissh I wil take no cure But of such as shal helth haue / & ye is most sure Manyon suche is nowe a dayes if they were well sowght. For they be frendis in tyme of prosperite and gladnesse / and then they vysite ther frendis. But in tyme of trouble and mysrye thay wyl not see them. and therfore sayth Seneca. It is full harde to proue fren¦des in prosperite. and it is veray esy to proue them in ad¦uersite. and also it is written Eccles .xxxvi. Ther is a frende I name oonlye. and Isidore sayth. Frendis ther be but fewe that be frendlye to ye laste ende. Ther was somtyme a man that askyd of his sonne yf he had any feythfull frende to truste to▪ and he answerde and sayd that he had .iii. especy all frendes. Then sayde his fader a broder and a frende is prouyd in tribulacyon. Go ther¦fore and proue them. and soo forth he went and toke an
hogge and smote of his hede and his fete / and put hym in a sacke / and sent it to euery of them thre and sayde. Here is a man which I haue slayne by mysfortune. I de¦sire yowe to bery hym secretly / that I be not take with the fawte. But noon of all them thre wolde receyue hit. And for this cawse his fader counsellyd him to assaye his frendes. And also he tolde him a nothir example of two louers that were felowys. Of which the oon gran¦ted the othir a wyfe / which he had feruently louyd. And immediatlye he that had grauntyd this graunte went ouyr the see to vysite his frendes. And loste all his gooddes in the see. And whan he was retournyd a∣gayne / he durst not for shame shewe hym self / nor go to his felowe / but fell in desperacyon. And as it fortu∣nyd that same tyme / ther was a man slayne. And whā his bodye was fownde ther was great inquysicion ma¦de for him that slewe the man. And soo this man that was desperate confessyd that he had slayne the man / which he neuer did. But for becawse that he wold fay¦ne haue dyed for thought and confusyon And whan his felowe knewe hym be a sertayne tokyn. He sayd that he had kyllyd the man to delyuer his feloowe fro deth A laste he that was the veray homycyde / seynge all this disclosyd hym self and shewid that he verylye did the dede / and that the other twayn were nothinge gyltye. Valery tellyth also libro quarto capite septimo. Of gre¦te loue and kyndenesse that was betwene two frendys. And of them oone was callyd Damon / and the othir was namyd Phitia. And whan the Tyraunte Dyoni se wolde haue destroyde oon of them. He askyd lycence that he myght goo home to his owne hows / and dispo¦se his goodes / and the othir vndertoke vppon iubardye of lyfe that he shulde come agayne at a daye assygned.
And whan the daye drewe nere / and he was not herde of. Euery man blamyd the other and sayd that he was to hastye for to be his suretye / but he sayde playnly he dowbtyd not the constaunce and stablenesse of his fren¦de. And so in the same howre that was assygnyd hym he came and faylyd not. Wherof the Tyraunt meruay¦lyd greatlye / and of the sure myndes of them / and of yt faythfull frendeshippe / and forgaue his malyce and re¦myttyd the payne / and prayde them to receyue hym in to the thrid degre of loue / and good frendshippe. If oon man wyll doo somoche for an othir that is but mortall What owith he to do / for God yt is immortall / whiche suffirde hym self to dye for the loue of man. As hit is wryttyn Ecclesiasti .xix. Forgete thou not the grace of thy surytye and helper / for he gaue his lyfe for loue of the &cetera.
¶ Of tway hawkes and a Quayle. Dialogo. lvii. AN hawke callyd Osmerillus / and a Goshawke were confederate togi∣der to goo an hawkinge. And what game that euer they toke / it shulde be deuydid betwene them. It fortu∣nyd vppon a tyme / that they twayn togider toke a Quayle / beynge from her neste. A Quayle is a byrde that hath her name of Qualis, or ellys of the noyse that she makyth. For she cryeth / quaquera / quaquera / & whan these tway hau∣kes had this quayle / they sayde to her. Chese the whe∣thir the is leuer that we shall ete the allone. Qrellys yf thow wylte lede vs to thineste / that we shall ete the and thy children togider. To whom the Quayle sayde Angwyssh and trowble is to me on euery syde / & what is best I wote not. But lesse hurte me thinkith for me to dye / and to fall in to yowre hondes / my self alone / thē for to be kyllyd my self and all my children with me. And so they caught her / but or euyr they kylled her she spake and sayde. Lesse hurte it is to hym ye may none otherwise chese. Hym self alone to suffre / then many moo to lese IN lykewise by example of the Quayle we owe to doo / whan we may not escape from perell. Euer lette vs chese that / the whiche shall leste hurte / aftir counsell of the wiseman / yt sayth. Of tway harmys / the lesse is to be suffirde. We be bownde to chese rather for to dye / for a comune profite / then for to lyue for a syngler auayle / as saynte Augustin wryteth¦de Ciuitate Dei libro primo. Where he shewith / that
whan Marcs regulus was take and imprysonyd of them of cartage / and ye Romaynys had manye of them of cartage in pryson / which were yongmen and lustye. The forsayde regulus was sent home to Rome for an exchaunge. But or euyr he departyd fro the Cartage∣nensis he was sworn that if the Romaynes wolde not delyuer the prysoners of cartage / he shulde come agay¦ne. And whan he came to Rome he counseylyd the Ro∣maynes not to be greable to theyr petycyon / forasmoch as he was an olde man and be lykelyhode shulde lyue but a whyle. And ther prysoners were yongmen / and lykely to doo greate myscheef to the Romaynes in ty∣me comynge. And they prayde hym to go no more to car¦tage / but to abyde styll with them at Rome. But in no wyse he wolde not be greable / but forth he went to car∣tage. And whan he came thedir / he was cruelly put to deth / It had bene profitable to hym to haue bydde styll at Rome / but for his oth it had not bene honeste. And for the profyt of the Romaynes it had not bene vaylea∣ble nor profitable. ¶ Of a byrde callyd Carflanchus that wold go to Relygyon. Dialogo. lviii. CArflanchus is a byrde lyke to a fawl∣con stronge and myghtye. This byrde in his yowth was disposyd to go to Re¦lygyon and to lyue in perfeccyon. But for drede of sharpenesse of the Rule / he differde it and sayde. I trowe verylye and I beleue / that I may not faste. Nor ryse to Matey∣nes. Nor kepe chastyte. Nor forsake myn owne wyll. And for this cawse that he wolde begyn no goode dede
For drede of penaunce / he came neuir to the myddes / but rather endid his lyfe full lewdely saynge in this wyse. He that for drede no vertewe wyll vse Shall perysshe dowghtlesse / & grace him refuse. SO many one coueyte and desyre to flye to the gra∣ce of God. But they fere to lacke the pleasure of ye worlde. For certaynly the loue of Cryste prouokyth & steryth them to vertewe. But couetyse and worldlye affeccyon drawith them agayne. And of suche many be wonde oftyn tymes to saye. I wolde serue God gladly I wolde gladlye go in to relygion. But I drede I shuld not be able to maynteyne the sharpenesse therof. Such folkys take noon hede to the saynge of the apostle / ad Philip .iiii. I may do all thinge in him that confortithe me / that is to saye in Cryste. and barnarde sayth. God is to them that truste in him. Richesse in pouertye. So∣lace in sadnesse / ioye in ambycyon / worshippe in contem¦pte, a shadowe in diffence / from bete and from rayne. a
teller of Fablys saith that on a tyme. The sawcon to∣ke a kyte / and threwe hym vndir his fete / and withe one of his fete smote him and sayde. Thow art vnhap¦pye. for thow art as greate as I and as stronge. & why defendist not thou thy self fro me that trede on the and wyll ryppe owte thy bowellys. The kyte answerde & sayde. Thow sayst soth. I am gretter and strenger thē thow / and I haue a perylous byll / and my fete be stren¦ger then thyne / but my harte lackyth / and soo it farithe be manyon / that may doo many good thinges / but the harte faylith. and stedfaste mynde is a waye. There was oon fell in to a watyr and cowde not swym. wher∣fore he cryed owte. Saynt George helpe me. Saynt George came to hym and sayde. Thowe slowfull man helpe thy self / moue thy hondes and thi feete / and thou shalt be sauyd. For he that wyll helpe him self. Is hol¦pyn of God. So shulde he doo that is fallyn in to synne. For he shulde not aske forgeuenesse of God oonly with his mowth. but labowre and doo his vttyr diligence to ryse owte of synne. Saynt augustyn tellyth in Epistle to Ierome. That whan a sertayne persone vppon a ty¦me / was fall in to  pytte / and an othir came bye / & as∣kyd howe he fell inne / he sayde. I praye the inquyre not howe I fell inne / but assaye rather be what meanys thow canste helpe to gete me owte. ¶ Of the lapwynge and the Popyniaye. dial. lix. VPupa is a byrde as saith Isidore .xii. Ethi∣mol. & in englyssh it is callyd a laywynge. Grekys call her Vpupa / for cause yt she of∣tyn beholdith & considerith ye fylthye donge of man. and she is fed wit stinking donge
and she is an vnclene byrde. She hath thre Crestis of feddirs stondinge on her heede / and she bydeth moch in pittis and ther as is donge and fylth. With the bloode of the which byrde if a man anoynte hym self whan he goyth to sleape / he shal se fendes abowt to destroye him The byrde for cawse that she is fayre and plesauntely Crestyd and fedryd with dyuerse colowres / she began to lyft vp her self beholdynge the Popyniaye dwellyng with the kynge in a Cage of golde / the which was fed∣de clenlye of the kynges mete / and thus she sayde. I am as plesaunte as a popyniaye. Neuyrthelesse I seke my lyuynge with greate labowre. This popyniaye dwel∣lyth worshipfullye and he labowrith not / nor swetith / and he is seruyd to his pleasure. Wherfor I purpose to go to the kynge and to profre hym my seruyse / and to synge in a cage as doth the popyniaye / and to fare well yf I maye / and to make mery with the kynge. And soo she flewe to the kynge. And whan he had her / he putte
her in to a cage / and kepte her there. and whan she had bene there a whyle / she toke great thought and was ve¦ry sory that she was in captiuite and daunger that som¦tyme was fre and at lybertye. and therfore for thowght and heuynesse / she leuyd but a whyle. and sayde or she departyd fro the worlde. To Fredom and lybertye comparison to make. Ther is noon trwlye / all othir thinge to take. SO manyon speke of Relygyows men and saye. These bredryn be wele possessyd. They be wele Fedde. They synge and lyue withowte greate labowr but whan they wyll proue it / and be includid in a mona¦stery and be vndir Rule and vndyr the power of ther souerayne / they repente that they haue loste ther lyber¦tye / as a Philosofre sayth. Libertye is not gladlye solde Of this worlde for all the golde. Valery tellyth lib .vi. That lenonydes the Noble duke of spartaynes / withe CCC. men faught agayne xerxem kynge of Perce. And with a Comfortable there he exhortyd his men to fighte and sayde / My trewe seruauntis and sowdy∣owrs / dyne and make yow stronge / as thoughe ye shal neuer ete more. And they did soo / and were nothinge a∣ferde of his saynge. And whan ther was no hope to es∣cape / he hartyd them soo that they were gladde to suf∣fre deth / rather then to lese ther lybertye / and to be ser∣uauntis vnto the percys. Also Orosius tellyth libro vi. That Demetrius kynge of Ponte and Armenye / when his owne sone besegid hym / and wolde not cese / he was sorye therfore and came down to the lower par¦tys of his hows / and gaue venyme to drinke to all hys wifis / his dowghters / and his concubynes / and he him self dranke of the same for thought and desperacyon / & for all that whan he sawe that he cowde not dye lyght¦lye.
He offrid him self to be slayne to oon of his enymys that entirde be a wall. Rather then he wolde be subdu∣ed to his enymyes / and lese his lyberte and fre wyll. Al¦so Orosius tellyth that some men were besegid by the Romaynys and be scypyon of Affrike / and consydered wele that and if they were take / they myght not resiste the Romaynes. For cawse the sayde Romaynes shuld not reioyce of ther goodes. They made faste the gatys of ther cite / and brynnyd them self / ther Cite / and all ther goodes / rather then they wolde yelde them self / to theyr enymyes. It is red also in Ecclesiasticall historie that in the tyme of Abrahe. A kynge of Babylon callid Belus entirde in a parte of Syrye / and dyed breuely af∣tir. But his wife that was callyd semyramys was am¦bycyows to be Queene / and to the Entent yt she myght regne she weddid her owne sonne / that was namyd Ny¦nus. The which aftyrwarde toke also Syrye / and ma¦de a greate cytye of thre dayes iourney / to goo or to ryde and aftyr his name that was Nynys / he callyd the cy∣te Nynyue. And he had a chylde by his owne modyr. And the name of him was Babylio / and he enlargyd the cite of Babylon. ¶ Of the Henne / and the Culuyr. Dialogo. lx. AN Henne and a Culuyr made ther ne¦stys togider / and dwellyd both in on hows. but oftyntymes they were at greate stryfe / for cawse that oon san∣ge tomoche / and the othir cryed tomo¦che. The Henne many tymes sawe the Culuirs children hangid / & she
made merye and sange / wherfore the Culuyr was sore greuyd and sayde to the Henne. Thowe Henne thowe mowrnist not with me / when thow seyst my Children destroyed. The Henne answerde and sayde. Thou wilt not synge with me / when I bringe forth an Egge oute of my bowellys / and am delyueryd from greate parell. And thus they fell at grete varyaunce and spake vn∣kynde woordis / eche to other. And at the laste they togi¦der went to the Egle and sayde. Gyue iugement be∣twene vs O rightfull Quene we beseche the / if it be cō¦uenyent for vs twayne to dwell togider or not. The e∣gle gaue sentence in opyn audyence and sayde. Let them that be gladde haue their dwellynge alone And they that be sadde togider make ther mone. FOr it is not conuenient for them that be merye and iocounde / to walke with them that be in he¦uynesse. Nor for suche as be sad and sorye to dwel with them that be ioyfull and merye. but as the apo∣stle saith ad Romano .xii. Ioye ye withe men ioyjnge /
and wepe ye with men wepynge. But noot this well yt great gladnesse somtyme maye cawse sodayne deth. For therwith the harte waxith greate / and the natu∣rall hete goith to the extery or partis / and then the har¦te faylyth and deth entryth. Wherof Valery tellyth / yt on a tyme ther was tydyngis browght to a woman ye her sonne was dede / whan he was absente / and it was not so / but it sprange of errowre of some symple persone Neuerthelesse she beleuyd hit and mournyd and made greate heuynesse. and as she sate wepyng and sorowīg Sodeynly in came her sonne / and whan she sawe hym she ranne to him and kyste him / and sodeynlye feldoun dede. Tristice and heuynes sleyth not so soone. For in heuynesse the naturall hete Is drawyn firste to the in∣warde partyes / and suche steringe of the hete geuy the nourrisshinge in the membris / & so cawsith consumpci∣on in them / and so by processe of tyme folowithe Etica / as it is wrytten Prouerbio .xv. An heuy spirite drieth vp the bonys / Wherfore it may be prouyd that world∣lye ioye is lyke pure wyne / which sone turnith / and soo doth it / but if it be moderate with holsome sadnesse / as it is wrytten Ecclesiast .vii. Bettyr it is to goo to an hows of wepinge and sadnesse / then to an hows of fe∣stis and myrth. Tully tellythe that whan any consull of Rome had bene at batell and wonne the victory and was come home. He shulde haue thre dyuerse worship¦pes / doone to him. First all the people shuld come agay¦ne him with greate gladnesse. The secownde all ye pry¦soners that he had takyn shulde folow his chare with ther hondes faste manaclyd. The thryd was that the same victowr was indute with the cotearmure of iouis and sate in a chare and was conueyd withe .iiii. white stedys / vnto the capitoly. And for that he shulde not to
moche exalte him self / aboue him self. They mytyga∣te this honowre in the threfolde wise. For first a man of seruyle condicyon / shuld sit with him in the chare / that hope shulde be geuyn to euery person / to come to suche worshippe / if his manhode deseruyd it. The secounde ye same seruaunte syttinge with him shulde Bobbe him and saye to him. Knowe thi self. The thryd it was lau¦full to euery man that same daye / to bringe agayn him all the rebukys that they wold. Therfor yf paynymes and hethen men thus wisely cowde myxte ther vayne gladnesse. Moche more we that be Crysten men / owe to represse such vanyteys. For as saynt Gregory saith Perpetuall lamentacyon and heuynesse folowe ye ioyes of the worlde / to suche as loue them in especyall. And saynt Augustyn sayth. The gladnes of the worlde ys vanyte. with longe abydynge it is trustyd to come / and whan it is come / it may not longe endure.
¶ Of the Cocke and the Capon. Dialogo. lxi. IN a courtelage the Cocke and the Ca¦pon dwellyd togider. but the Cocke had dominacyon ouyr the Hennys. The Capon full mekely ete her mete amonge them. And as hit vnfortuna∣bly happyd the Foxe came and caught the Cocke and ete him / but he towchid not the Combe of his hede. but kepte it hoole / and led it to the Capon and sayde. O brodir Capon / thy folowe is departyd frō the worlde and for the greate loue that I owe vnto the I haue brought to the a goodly Combe / which he bare continually vppon his hede. Therfore descende & come down to me / and I shall crown the / and aftyr that thou shalt be prince and regent of the Hennys as he was. The Capon heringe this / and hopinge to haue Rule ouer the hennys. Cam down from the Rowste & went to the Foxe. The Foxe was gladde and sterte / and caught the Capon lyghtlye and kyllyd hym and sayd To euery worde no credence thow geue. beware of false men that the wolde my scheue. OF suche owre sauyowre commaundith vs to be∣ware saynge. Mat .vii. be ye ware of suche / as co¦me to yowe in the clothinge of shepe. For they be inwar¦dely lyke cruell wolkys. As Isope tellyth of a crowe / yt had a pece of flessh in his mowth / and stode vppon a tre And whan the Foxe had espyed him / she thowght in her mynde. O if I myght begile this crowe and haue ye flessh that he holdith in his mowth / I myght be merye And therfore she spake and sayde. brodir Crowe behold what I saye. Thy beawtye passyth the beawtye of all
byrdes / and thy strength excedith the strength of all o∣thir byrdes. but I am sorye that thow hast no voyce. Nor comynge to synge. and euyn forthwith the Crowe began to synge / and the flessh fellowte of his mowth. Which the foxe cawght and ete / and wente his waye. So oftyntymes it happith to a man whan he herythe him self preysid and comendid. Wherfore it is wrytten Ieremie .ix. Euery man kepe him from his neybowre yt is full of adulacyon. And put not to moche truste in his owne brodyr. and Caton sayth. beleue thowe not an o∣thir man of thy self / more then thy self. ¶ Of the Fesawnte and the Pecocke. Dialogo. lxii.
ELeccyon made the byrdes in a dyuy∣syon / and they chose the fesaunte & the Pecocke. And they twayn for ye Eleccyon fell at great wordes / and spente greate goodes. Therfore the byrdes went togider to the Egle & sayde. We haue made Eleccyon. But thow lyke a iuge gyue confir¦macyon that owre electis may be comprobate. The E∣gle cyted the electis wyllynge to examyn the Eleccy∣on. But the Fesaunte which is a byrde that came firste owte of Greke / and his flessh is veray swete to ete / ma¦gnyfyed him self greatly saynge. O rightfulliuge as thow knowist wele. I am veray delicate. Fayre alsoo / and dyuersly colowrid. My flessh is redolent and swe∣te / aboue all othir. Wherfore the principalyte becomyth me beste. The Pecocke defendid him selfe to his vtter∣most power and sayde. Madame and it please your gra¦ce it is not so / as the Fesawnte hath sayd. For I my self am fayrer than he / and gretter / and crestid. And alsoo my tayle yeldith to me the souerayn worshippe. And with these wordes he lefte vp his Tayle / and spredde it a broode / and reioycyd greatlye ther in. The Egle dis¦cretely consyderinge all this sayde first to the Pecocke. Thow Pecocke thow hast greatly rebukyd thiself / in lyftynge vp of thitayle. For thowe hast shewyd vs a payre of fowle fete. Therfore thow arte not worthy to be a ruler. At last she spake also to the Fesawnte / and sayde. Thow hast rinnynge Ien / and thow art but we¦ke / and thow canste not synge. And therfore for the im∣pedimentis that thow hast / and othir cawsis lefull I depryue the from worshippe. And so they both were put from promocyon and contynuyd withowte worshyppe
duringe both ther lyuys and sayde. He is not worthy gydinge to take. That of eche worde greate quarell will make. THis vice regnith of tyntymes in them that be ele∣cte. For be questyonīg of the Eleccyon many men¦nys fawtis be rekenyd vp. Wherfore they be diuerse ty¦mes rebuked and diffamyd. Wherfore it is not good to stryue for preeminence of worshippe. For Gregory saith Desire of prelacye is gendrid of pryde / of the harte / and whosoeuyr desyre soueraynte in erth shall fynde confu∣syon in heuyn. This desire to haue gouernaunce / is pe∣rilowse / and to be eschewyd to owre powers. For as gre¦gory saith. The higher the ruler is in worship / the mo¦re is he in perell. Wherfore princes in the old tyme wol¦de not suffre ther children to be preferryd withowt they myght profite / as tellyth Helmandus historiographus of helio adriano. Than whan he was from a senatour create an Emperowre / and the Senate desirid hym to name his sonne that same tyme Augustum Cesarem. He answerde them and sayde. Truly it owith to suffice that I vnwilfully regne when I haue not deseruyd it. For Pryncehode and rule longith not vnto bloode. but vnto goode merytes and goode gydinge. And oftynty∣mes / He is not profitable vnto the Reame / that is born a kynge. For withowte dowbte he cannot loue his fren∣des / that destroyeth his children with importable char¦ge. This is to saye to destroye his children / whan he promotyth them not for ther merytes. They owe to be norisshed and excercised in vertewe / and whan they ha¦ue continuyd in them it shuld be prouyd that they shul be goo before in vertewys / that shulde be first preferrid to worship. And so they actually fulfyllyd that is com∣maundid Eccles .vii. Intende thow not to labowr to be
a iuge. But yf thow maye be thy vertewe destroye syn¦ne and wyckednesse. Wherof it is wrytten in Policrati¦con li .vj. That Octauyan when his children were wor¦thy to be promotyd to greate worshippe. He wolde not promote them / but if they myghte be theyre vertewe & strength defende them self and othir also sufficientlye. Wherfore he commaundid that they shulde be excercy¦sed to Runnynge to lepynge to swymmynge / to throw stonys with the honde / or withe a slynge / and in suche other faculteys as longith to knyghthode or seruyce. And his doughters he ordeynyd to be clothiers. That and if fortune had dryuen them to the extremyte of po¦uertye / they shulde haue theyr sustentacyon and leuyn¦ge / by reason of ther conynge / for of spynnynge and we bynge and of cloth makynge / thay had not oonely co∣nynge but also daylye excercise. And it is commawn∣did Eccle .vii. If thow haue men children. Teche thē / or cawse them to be tawghte. And it folowith in the sa¦me place. And if thow haue dowghters kepe the body∣es of them from corrupcyon and synne &c. ¶ Of the Rauyn and a byrde callyd ficedula. Dialogo. lxiii. COrnix in owr tonge is callyd a rauyn and it is a byrde that leuyth vnto the age of a. M. yeris as Papye wrytteth This byrde vppon a tyme labowrid sore and made her neste. Wherfor her feddyrs fell awaye / and she was lene / but notwithstondīg she nourisshed her eggis & brought them forth. That self tyme Ficedula which in lateyn is also callyd papafigo / went vnto her and rebukyd her
greatlye and wolde not suffre her be in peace. Cornix for loue of her Egges toke pacyentlye all thynge. But notwithstondinge her mynde was sore vexyd / but she kepte it close with in her self. Aftyrwarde whan her children were brought forth this cornix began to amen¦de / and newlye repayryd her self. But the forsayde byr¦de ficedula came agayne and rehersyd contumelyows woordes / and began to despise her as she had doon befo∣re. wherfore she was greuouslye mouyd / and in wyll to be auengid / and in that greate Ire she caught this byr∣de and kyllyd it and sayde. who that wyll oftyn varye and make fraye. Sekith his owne deth in soth it is no Naye. WHan manyon seyth an other depressyd or in dise¦ase / he is glad to rebuke him / and to doo hym wronge. But whan thou seyst a man in mysche¦fe thou shuldist not rebuke hī. for ye philosofre saith. to be rebukyd in wretchidnesse is more greuo{us} thā yt wret¦che dnesse / it is gret wrōg not to be cōpassionable to thē
that be in trowble. Princes and lordis in the olde tyme were pitefull and compassionable to wretchis and to di∣seasid folke in ther mysery. Wherof Valery tellyth lib .v. that whan Cesar lokyd vppon the hede of Pompey that was smytte of. He wepte sore / and let fall manye Terys of greate piete. Also he tellyth there / that whā Marcus Marcellus had takyn the Siracusanys / and was in a towre of that riche cyte / and whan he remem∣brid and inwardlye behelde the my fortune and afflyc∣cyon of the same noble cyte. He cowde not restrayne hī from weping. He tellyth also there / of the buxomnes of Pompey shewyd to the kyng of Armenye / which agay¦ne the Romaynes oftyntymes had made greate warre But that notwithstondinge whan he was takyn and ouircome / he wolde not suffre longe to knele before him but confortyd him with curteys woordes / and comman¦dyd the crowne to be set vppon his hede / that he hī self had layde awaye / and restorid him vnto his first degre and worshippe. and sayde it was as greate a dede to re∣store a kynge to his worshippe. As to subdue him / & put him from his worshippe. And a lyke tale he tellith of a counsell that was namyd pawle / which vppon a tyme whan a kynge was takyn / and shulde be browght befo¦re him. He went to mete him / and whan he wolde haue knelyd for mercye. This noble counsull wolde not suf∣fre him / but toke him vppe / and set him on his right si∣de / and cheryd him with greate comforte / and ordeynid him nexte to him self in counsellys and at his Table. For althoughe that it be lawdable to haue victorye / & ouirthrowe enymyes. It is as greate honowr to be mer¦cyfull to them that be in heuynesse.
¶ Of the Nightcrowe / and the larke Dialogo. lxiiii. NIcticorax is a nyghtcrowe in Englysshe / & it is deryuyd of Nictos that is nyghte / and Corax which is a Crowe / as who sayth a nyghtcrowe / for she flyeth in the nyghte. Or for that she wakyth all the nyghte. Isidore Ethimol .xii. Nicticorax she is Noctua the owl that louyth darknesse. The larke went to this byrde & sayde. Moste dere sustre hartely I praye the to be with me to morowe / for a louer of myn desyrithe to see me in the clere daye lyghte. And if we twayne be togider / I shall seme the fayrer. The nighecrowe promysed to ful¦fyll her desire / for she was ashamyd to saye naye in such a small matere. And whan the day aperyd and phebus shoone plesauntlye and clere. The larke lokyd for her
to fulfyll her promys. But she came not. For she durst not be shewyd in the bright sonne / and also she myghte nothinge see in the daye light. wherfor the Larke was sorye and gretly trowblyd and abhorryd her and pur∣suyd her eueraftir and vnto this daye. And therfore ye Owle dare not flye in the daye tyme for fere of the lar∣ke / and so she fleyth all in the nyghte / and sekythe her mete with greate penurite and hongre saynge in thys wyse. Noman shulde for loue nor for doubte. Promyse that thinge that he cannot bringe abowte. THerfore we owe to be ware to make promys of thinge impossible to be perfourmyd / that we be not prouyd vntrewe. If it fortunyd the to be de∣syred of thy frende to doo suche thinge as plesith ye not. be not ashamyd to saye naye / rather then to promyse & perfourme it not. For the philosofre sayth. beware that shamefastnes of denyinge / Cawse not to thy self neces¦site of lyinge. For he is not deceyued that is lyghtly de∣nyed. Neuerthelesse manyon for liberalyte and fre har¦te be shamefaste to saye nay of thinges desyred of them As it is wrytten in gestis Romanorum of the lyberaly¦te of Tyte the Emperowre. For he ordeynyd that no∣man shulde aske of him withowt hope of hauynge or he let them go. And his frendes askyd of him why he grā¦tyd more then he myght geue. And he answerde & sayde that for cause no man shuld departe heuyly yt had spok with him. also it is red in gestis Romanorum of Tra∣iane / that whan his frendis rebukyd him that he was famylyer with euery man / more thā thei thought was conuenient to his dignite / that is to say in condescēding to theyr petycions. This Traiane answerde and sayd that he wolde be to Euery Creature as gracyows and
Curteys as they cowde thinke or desire to haue hym / and so he continuyd eueraftyr ¶ Of the wagtayle and the Fesaunte. Dialogo. lxv. A wagtayle doth continually wag her tayle in ded / & therfor she is so namyd Vppon a tyme she went to ye Fesaunt & sayd. Thou wretche why wypest not thow thyn Ien. Thei be euer ful of watyr / & ye stenche of thē causithe yt to be abhominable to al men. The Fesaunt was wroth & answerd & sayd / art not thou a∣shamyd mad wrech yt art so vile & so lytel / & thou hast a wagging tayle ful of palsye / and thou art besy to no∣te my vicis. but go forth & amend thyn own fautes first and then thou shalt be hoole. The wagtayle heringe this / was sore ashamyd / and withe confusyon turnyd home agayne and sayde.
First pourge thy self from all maner of Synne Or thow agayne othir any iugemente begynne SO in lyke somefolke toke noon hede to ther owne fawtes. But they be redy to rebuke other folkes / and forgete them self. To suche owr sauyowre spekyth Luce .vi. and Mat .vii. Why canst thow espye a lytell mote in thyn neybowris Ie / and considerist not a great beame in thyn owne. Or how mayste thowe for shame saye to thy brodir suffir me to take the mote out of thyn Ie / not seynge so great a beame in thyn own Ie. Thow Ipocryte first take the greate beame fro thyn own Ie / & thow mayst the bettyr then helpe thi brodirs Ie. It is rede in vitis patrum that a Relygyows man / spake & blamyd on of his bredren and detractyd him before the couente. The abotte of the same place was agyd / and sayde no woorde. And vppon a tyme whan he bare be∣hynde him a sacke full of grauell / and had layde a lytel of the same grauell before hym / oon askyd of him what he bare / and he sayde / a sacke full of grauell / which be∣tokened his owne synnes. But he sayde while they we¦re behynde him he carid not for thē. But the smal hand full of grauell that laye before him / he sayde theke we∣re his brodirs synnes which he had detractyd. And mo∣reouer he addid these woordes and sayd. bredren it shul¦de not be soo. but myn owne synnes owyth euyr to be in my mynde. And I am bownde to thinke vppon them / & so is euerye creature. And his bredren sayde. Trulye this is the waye of lyfe and helth euerlastinge. ¶ Of the Nyghtyngale and ye crowe emonge other byrdes. Dialogo. lxvi.
VPpon an highe solempne daye. The Egle had boode all other byrdes to dy¦ner / and whan they had dynyd and fa¦ryd ryally / the Egle callyd the Nygh∣tyngale to her and sayde. Doughter goo and breke thy voyce / and synge as thou art lernyd and shewe thi connynge to chere owre hartys. The nyghtingale was obediente and glad to please / and began to synge so plesauntly that almaner of byrdes desirouslye lyftened to her songe. Amonge al othir a crowe came bye and consyderinge that he sayde to him self. I will also synge with the Nyghtyngale. For I haue a greate voyce / and I shall be harde farre. And he began to Croke in a full fowle maner. The Nyghtingale was styll and myght synge no lenger ye crowe made so fowle a noyse. And all the other Byrdes were sore trowblyd and abhorryd the Crowe / for he de¦spisid the feste. Therfore the Egle commaundid hym
to goo his waye / or to be styll. The crowe answerd and sayde that he wolde solempnyse the feste with other bir¦des / and he intendid not to remeue from his place for her woordes. The secounde tyme the Egle chargid hym to departe / for noman reioycyd to here him. But the crow wolde not be styll / but began to garre and coye more & more. Wherfore the Egle commawndid him to be kyl∣led without lenger respite and sayde in this wise. Songe or other connynge be it neuer so dere. Is shewyd but in vayne to thē that lyft not here. SO it is but foly to speke where the herers be dull to take hede. Therfore it is sayde Ecclesi .xxxiii. Shewe not thy Sermon ther as is noone audyence. And farthermore he sayth. In compeny of greate men presume not to speke. And there as be senyowrs speke not tomoche / lyke as the crowe sange but lewdlye. So a legate of athenys answerde symplye before kyng phi¦lyppe. Of whom Seneca tellyth / libro tercyo de Ira. Where he shewith that whan the legatis of athenen∣sis were come before kynge Philippe / and ther legacye harde. The kynge curteyslye answerde and sayde. Lo∣ke what ye thinke I maye do to the pleasure of the athe¦nensis / and ye shall fynde me resonable. To whom oon of the same legatis Namyd Democritus answerde sa∣ynge to the kynge. To hange thi self. And whan they that stoode abowt were indignate and wolde haue be∣ne auengid. The kynge commaundid to let him go / vn¦punyshed / and sayde to the othir legatis. Shewe yowe vnto the Athenensis that they be moche more prowde that speke suche woordes / then they that pacyently he¦re them / when they be vnpacyently spokyn.
¶ Of a byrde callyd Ciconia / & the swalowe. Dialogo. lxvii. CIconya vppon a tyme made her neste in an highe towre withowte in ye top∣pe / and the swalowe byldyd within. But the swalowe made greate noyse oftyn tymes and reioycyd of brynging forth of her byrdes. Wherwith thys Ciconia was greatly trowblyd. For whan she wolde haue takyn reste with her children / she myght not for the chatheringe of the swalowe. Therfor in the absen¦ce of the swalowe Ciconya destroyed her neste / and kil¦lyd her byrdes. And whan the swalowe was come ho∣me agayn to her neste. She made right doulfoll sorowe for her children. But forasmoch as she knew not who did it / she auengid not the dede. Within a while after ye swalowe repayrid her self agayne / and made a newe
neste and brought forth her byrdes and was greatlye glad of them / and chyrkyd faste and made moche noy∣se. Wherfore Cyconia was greuid greatelye as afore tyme / and spake lowde / and sayde. Certaynlye but if thowe be styll. I shall throwe downe thi byrdes withe thy neste as I dyd oonnys / for cawse that thow inquy∣etest me and makyth suche noyse that I can haue no re¦ste with my children. This heringe the swalowe and knowynge / veryly that Cyconya had mourdird her children / with all her hole mynde she bethought her ho¦we to be auenged. And therfore vpon a tyme whan Ci¦conia was slepinge with her children / the swalowe ca¦me pryuelye and sette fire in her neste / and brynnyd her with all her children and sayde. He that on his Enymyes seyth his quarel bewroke Of moche thowght & heuynesse his harte is vnloke. By this exemple it aperith that hit is not goode to vexe or to wronge them that be vndir / for doub∣te that they wyll be auenged / other openly or pry¦uelye. For oftyntymes hit fortunith that a man recey∣ueth of other as he had deseruyd before tyme him self. For seneca sayth. Loke thow haue of an other as thow hast done to other. And the Apostle powle sayth / ad co locensis .iii. He that doth iniurye and wronge / shal ha∣ue his rewarde aftyr his deseruinge. As Isope tellyth yt the Egle flewe in to an highe hyll / and fownde the fo∣xys children ther / which she toke owte of ther denne & caryed them with her to her neste / that she and her byr¦des shulde haue ete them to ther sowper. And whan ye Foxe was come home to his loggynge et found not his children he went down to the woode and cried for them and at the laste he harde them wepe and mourne in the Eglis neste. The Foxe spake to the Egle many swete
woordis and with greate reuerence prayde her to dely∣uer the children. But vtterly the Egle wold not grant nor gyue audyence to her peticion. Wherfore the Foxe was angrie and impacyent and wente and gadrid stye∣kys bowys and braunches of vynes that were seere & drye and brought a bronde in her mowth / and made so greate smoke vndre the tre that she kyllyd the Eglys byrdes. And whan the Egle considerid al thing she was fayne to meke her self and came downe and delyueryd ye whelpes by compulsion. Of tway harmys chesyng the lesse. By this a man is tawghte / that thowgh he be at auauntage and aboue / let him dowte to offende hym yt is vndir / and euer of tway harmys chease the leste har¦me. Wherof a sertayne auctour saith. Noman owith to stodye to hurte hym that is weke & pouer. For he that is both weke and pouer may somtyme hurte hym that is aboue him.
¶ Of a byrde callyd a Pygarde and a greate byrde callyd Alietus. Dialo. lxviii. PIgardue is a byrde as wrytteth vgn¦cyo / and but a lytell byrde nombrid emonge them that be comestible and hable to mannys sustinaunce / as hit is wrytten Deuteronomii .xiiii. And vppon a tyme whan this lytell byrde was sore pursewyd in the eyre by an othir Rauenows byrde and stoode in greate iudardye of her lyfe. To ha∣ue proteccyon and to be defendid she fledde vnto the alie¦te and sayde. Thow arte great myghty also and merci¦full. Therfore I come vnto the that am but lytell and impotent and knowe no refuge / and in me is no resisten¦ce. Be thow my proteccyon I beseche the / and defende me fro my cruell enymye vnder the couerte of thy mer∣cyfull wynges. This Alietus which as Papye saith / is a byrde lyke vnto an Egle but larger was mouyd with piete & answerde to this lytell byrd & sayd. Foras¦moche as thow art a lytell byrde and humble / weke & impotent / and desirest socowr of me. Syt downe & reste the with me and walke withe me whan I walke and drede thow nothinge. And thus he sauyd the lytell byr¦de and comfortyd him and sayde. Mekenesse and pouerte shulde euer be defendid and ther as it is contrary Godmay soone amende it. IN this example it aperith that they that be im¦potente shulde be defendid and holpyn in ther ne¦de of them that be myghty. For yt is great meke nesse and mercy. For mekenesse and mercy as Bernard saith is prouyd the gretter when it is shewyd in them yt be greate / and in them that be clere it is the more clere. and Seneca also sayth. He that may socowre to hym yt
shulde perissh and socorith not he steyth hym. In he olde tyme princys were mouyd withe pitie and beniu∣lence to such as were vnder them / as it aperith euydent¦ly in ther gestis. Wherof Helmandus tellyth in gestys Romanorum of Traiane that vppon a tyme whan he shulde take his horse towarde batell in grete haste / ther came a widowe to him with greate lamentacyon & sayd Ibeseche the to auenge the bloode of myn innocent chil¦de which lately was slayne. To whom Traiane sayde If I come agayne with victorye and helth I shal auen¦gethe. and the widowe sayde. Who shall doo equyte to me yf thow be slayne in this batell. Traiane answerde he that shal succede me in the Empyre. To whom the wedowe sayde. and what shal that auayle the yf an o∣ther man do rightwysnes to me. Traiane sayde. Cer∣taynly nothinge. To whome the widowe answerde / & sayde. Is it not bettyr that thowe thy self doo ryght to me / and so to encrece thyn own merytes / than to leue it to an othir man. Then traiane was mouyd with pitie and descendid from his horse and auengid her cawse and set her harte at reste. also vppon an othir tyme / whan oon of ye sonnys of traiane rode throwe ye cyte veray wā¦tonly / he kyllyd a widows sonne with his horse. & whā ye wydowe had shewyd it to his fader with great lacry¦macyon and mourninge he gaue his owne sonne to the same wydowe foreuer / with greate aboundaunce of o∣ther richesse. ¶ Of a byrde callyd Onocrotalus and the asse. Dialogo. lxix.
THer is a byrde as Brito saith / the which is cal¦lyd Onocrotalus or Onocrotalon / and his co∣myth of Onos that is an asse. For she hath a face lyke an asse / and her body is lyke a swan. This byrde made her neste in a greate wilder∣nesse and layde her eggis and brought forth her byrdes. but whan she cowde no lenger fynde sustynaunce in the deserte to her and her children / she went to the cite / and callyd the asse to her frendlye and sayd. O brodyr I am lyke to the as thow well seyst / for I haue an Assis face as thow hast. Therfore thow shuldest trust me bettyr than an othir. I praye the come with me and dowte not The Asse was innocente and credidle seynge his owne similitude / and symply went with her. and Onocrota∣lus ledde the asse forth right to the markette / and ther boughte dyuers metys and bestowyd moch money and lodid the asse sufficyently and sayd. Go with me brodir and let vs carey this vytayle to owre children and I
shall rewarde the to thy pleasure. The Asse went with this Onocrotalon through the deserte a greate whyle but at the laste with greate labowre he came to the ne¦ste and layde down his burdon and toke his rewarde & turnyd him homewarde. But for cawse that he was in deserte and in a fowle myrye contray and knewe not the perfite waye / He cowde not goo home / and so he pe∣risshed euyn there in the wildernesse and sayde. Noman to go farre owith to be fayne But he be assuryd howe to come agayne. WHerby it aperith that noman shulde goo to far¦re contrays that he knowith not for dyuers pa¦rellys that dayly happe throwe the worlde. For it is wrytten primo Iohannis secundo. Al the worl¦de is set in greate myschefe. As who saith. Whersoeuer a man be he is euer in great parell. And therfore the a∣postle complaynyth secunda ad Corinthios .xi. of dy∣uers parellys in londe in water / and especyally in false Crysten people. Therfore as Gregory sayth. We mu¦ste euyr drede / for we be euer in parell / as hit is redde in collacyonidus patrum. That on a tyme ther was a so¦lytary man leuyd in the most perfight wyse and seruyd God / and the fynde dayly waytyd to bringe him to per¦dicion by greate sotylte. wherfore on a tyme he transfi¦gured him self in to the lykenesse of a marchantes hor∣se / hauynge bagges on his bakke full of Gold and syl¦uer and precyous stonys / and he entyrde sodeynly in to the cell of this holy man and stode ther. And he seynge the horse meruay led greatly what it shuld meane. and whan he sawe noman pursuynge aftyr the horse / he be¦gan to towche him & to vndo the baggis. In the which he fownde greate haboundance of goodes temperall / & money innumerable. And soo he was ouercome withe
temptacyon and clothyd him self in the moste fressh wi¦se / and toke the horse and roode to a great cite with all that good and toke vp an hostage and ete and drank of the beste. And whan the goodeman that hostyd hym / sawe and consyderyd his greate rychesse / he gaue hym his dowghter to wyfe / and he dwellyd styll in that sa∣me hows. The deuyll came within a shorte space aftir and aperyd to the goodeman of the same hows in lyke∣nesse of a man / and sayde. What hast thowe done. To whom hast thow geuyn thy doughter. He is a Clerke and Apostata and by the lawe she maye not be his wi¦fe. And whan this man hard this he was sadde for his dowghter and serchid his hede and fownd that it was soo / and pryuelye kyllyd him / and whan he wolde haue vndoone the sacke / he fownde nothing saue water and donge. Therfore it is sayde. Ecclesiast .ix. A man kno∣with not his ende. Butte as a Fisshe is takyn with an hooke and a byrde with a snare so is a synfull man ta∣kyn in his synne / and in many parellys. In the greate see of marcyle scantlye oon escapith of many / and of thē that passe throwgh the parellys of this worlde fewe es¦cape. Wherof it is wrytten in vitispatrum. The abbot Theodorus gaue an answere to a monke that sayd to him a brodir of owris is retournyd to the worlde mer∣uayle thow not therof. But and if thowe mayst here & vnderstonde that any man hathe preuaylyd and esca∣pyd fro the hondes of his goostlye enymys / therof thou maist wele maruayle and thanke God. ¶ Of the Swan and the crowe. Dialogo. lxx.
CIgnus a swan is a byrde all whyte. And Coruus a crowe is all blacke. And he therfore enuyed the swan / for his whytenesse and clennesse. Therfo¦re the crowe with great stodye and be¦sy labowre sought the meanys to defi¦le the swan / and to make him blacke as he is. But forasmoche as he cowde not bringe his propose abowte whi∣le the swan was wakynge. He la bowryd to do it whyle he was slepinge. Wherfore vppon a nyghte slepinge ye swan / the cursyd crowe came to his neste in secrete wise and defilyd the swan / and made hi all blacke. And whā the daye was sprnge and Titan shoone / and the swā was rysen from sleape and espied that he was effecte & pollute / he went and wasshyd him self so longe / that he was puryfyed and clene / from all filth and sayde.
who that desireth blessyd to be. Muste euyr be clene in his degre. THe crowe signifieth the Deuyll / which maye not see nor beholde the clene lyfe of the seruauntys of God. wherfore with all his power and might he is besy to pollute and defile them. But forasmoche as he cannot preuayle agayne them wakynge / he labow∣rith to deceyue them slepinge / wherfore man owith to wake. For saynte Augustyn saith. Thyn enymye wa∣kyth and thow sleapiste. And it is wrytten primo Pe∣tri vltimo. Dere frendes be ye sobre and wake in deuou¦te prayers / for yowre aduersarye the Deuyll goyth a∣bowte lyke a lyon rorynge / and sekynge whom he may deuowre. To whom resiste ye stronge in yowr fayth. And Isidore sayth. Suche folke as be stable in fayth / whan wyckyd spirites see they cannot ouercome them wakynge / they trowble them sore sleapinge / wherfore it is redde in vitis patrum. That fendis deludyd a Re∣lygyows man in somoche that whan he with his bre∣dryn shulde haue bene how silde / while he slepte there aperyd vnto him the symylytudes of women and defi∣lyd him / and he askyd cownsell of his senyowres what was best to doo. and they inquyryd of his diete and gy∣dynge / and founde by experience that it grewe not of su¦perfluyte of mete and drinke / and therfore they iugid yt it came of illusyon of the deuyll / and they sadlye cown∣sellyd him not to abstayne from the holy comunyon for that cawse. and aftyrwarde the Deuyll deludyd hym no more / and shewyd that he had done it for to withdra¦we the holy man from that holy mysterye. ¶ Of a byrde Callyd Ornix and the Henne. Dialo. lxxi.
VPpon a tyme Ornix the wodehenne e¦pyed the eggis of a Pecocke and made her neste in a rychemannys hows. and whan ye Chekyns were hacchyd and browghte forth. They were great¦ly belouid of the richeman. wherfor he set great pryce by this henne and fedde her delycatlye / yt she shulde the bettyr noryssh her byrdes. But this Or∣nix was vnkynde to the other hennys of that place. For she was bolde of her mastir for fauowre of the che∣kyns and wolde in nowyse suffer the hennys to pyke with her / but bete them and draue them awaye. The hennys were bytterlye greuyd and sayd no woorde / but hopyd to see a tyme to be auengid. and whan these che∣kyns were growyn vppe they forsoke this wodehenne / and tournyd vnto ther owne pecocke kynde / and the ri∣cheman toke not then so greate hede of this wodehenne as he had done / but suffirde her to scrape for her lyuyng
amonge other hennes. And they were fresshly remem∣brid of the olde persecucyō of this wodehēne & thought they wolde be auenged / and therfore they wolde not suf¦fre her to pyke with them. And whan she reuoluyd in her mynde the olde felycite and welth that she had be inne / and the mysery that she was come to. She wepte & sayde. Alas alas I haue norysshed children & brought them vppe and they haue forsakyn me. But notwith∣stondinge the hennis wolde shewe no mercy to her. but layde on and all to bete her and sayde. He that is prosperows and hath the world at wyl Owith not to be cruell all other for to spyll. THis shulde euery wiseman remembre whan he is in office or in prosperite / and not to despise them yt be vnder. For the tyme alwaye ronnyth / and ther comyth many chaungis as it is wrytten Ecclesiast .iii. al thinge hath tyme and euery thinge vnder heuyn is mutable in space. For ther is a tyme of prosperite and a tyme of aduersite. Tyme ronnyth lyke a whele / in the which some ascende and some descende. but they that be goynge vpwarde shuld not despise them that be comin¦ge downwarde. For as it is sayde Ecclesia .vii. Scorne thow noman that is in heuynesse for God is an ouerse∣er that can make both highe and lowe. and alsoo hit is wrytten Eccles .xi. In the dayes of thy welth be not for¦getfull of harmys / and especyall for chaunginge of ty∣mes and also of offices / for as Isidore saith. Temperal power is faynte frayle and Caduke. Who can say and tell where be the kynges and princes or the Emperou¦res. where be the richemen where be the myghty men / of the worlde / Xerses kynge of Perse and Mede moost prowde and moost myghty which ouertournyd hylles and coueryd the sees. whan vppon a tyme he stoode yn
an highe place / and sawgh and behelde an infinite and innumerable multytude of people he weppyd sore. Re∣membringe that within an C. yerys space after that / noon of them shulde be leuynge. and also whan he wēt agayne the grekys / with a Thowth and thowthandes of men of armys / and with a M. and. CC. of shippes seynge before him so greate an hoste / and remembringe of the chawnablenesse of tyme / and of the breuenesse of lyfe and wherto all thinge shulde retourne / he was hu¦mylyate and made lowe in his owne mynde and sayde. Men call me a kynge / that am but a man of suche po∣wer and strength to bringe suche a multitude togider. but sertaynly I saye my self as trew is / that I am but duste and asshyn. alsoo whan the Duke of lotheringe / laye in extremys / and was departinge from the world he lokyd vppon his howses and castellys and sayde. O good lorde what auaylyth these temperall goodes. For I that haue so many castellys and palacys / and haue hadde power to gyue loggynge to so many men / knowe not nowe whethir to goo nor where I shal be lodgyd. ¶ Of the Quayle and the Larke. Dialogo. lxxii. VPpon a tyme the Quayle bethoughte her and sayde. The Goshawke is a great pursewar of my kynrede. but & if I myght be at peace with him & ha∣ue his frendeshippe and fauowr. I we∣re then in greate suretye and at greate hartys ease. and therfor she callyd the Larke vnto her / and spake fayre to her and sayde. Thow art worthy to be lawdyd for thow arte callyd alauda for thi wysdome
Therfore I desire the to goo to the Goshawke for me / and gete me his benyuolence and say to him. The quay¦le recommendith her vnto the obedyently as thy subie¦cte / and she hartely desireth to be knytte with the in a∣myte and fauowre / and to haue sure & stable peace with ye for euer / for the which cawse she sent me to ye yt I shuld geue a prouyd answer. The Larke went forth mekelye and reportyd these woordes to ye Goshawke. The Gos¦hawke was trowblyd greatlye with this message and sayd to ye Larke. This is an harde mater and greuous to here. Neuerthelesse I wyll yt she her self come with ye to my presence / and speke her own mowth for her self. And whan the Larke had harde these woordes she re∣tournyd and shewyd them ioyfully to ye Quayle. The Quayle was glad and forth she went with ye Larke to ye Goshawke to conferme pece and loue betwene them And as sone as ye Goshawke espyed them togider / He fell in desire and concupiscens and cawghte them both and ete them and sayde.
Noman shulde him self folowe make. With him that is greate but kepe his owne state. ANd in lykewyse he that hath enymyes that be myghty and stronge maye not prouoke them / to be frendlye to him but at ther owne pleasure that he be not acombrid with them. wherfore hit is wrytten Ecclesia .xiii. Be thow farre fro a man that hath powr of deth. For and yf thow be with him / thowe shalt fall in to his snares / as a Fable is tolde / that an Asse vpon a tyme for cawse of solace walkyd in a woode and met with a boore and boldely salutyd hym and sayde. Hay∣le myn owne brodir. The boore herynge that was mo∣uyd with ire / and thought to ere the Asse on smale pe∣s with his teth. But he refraynyd hym self and sayd I wolde all to rente the / but my noble teth despise / and abhorre so fowle and hatefull flessh as thyne is. And yt auaylyth the thi lyfe / herebye it is shewyd that he that is a foole owithe not to make Iapes and derysyons to hym that is wyce. Nor he that is lowe and in pouertye to be to besye with him that is myghty and riche. For they that be pouer and in lowe degre maye drede and fere to be oppressyd and to be punyshed richemen & my∣ghty drede not / but they be bolde for they be but seelde punyshed. Therfor the Cocke answerde to the Gos∣hawke that demaundid of him this questyon and sayd What is the cawse that ye drede men somoche withe whom ye be brought vppe and dayly noryshed / and we be buxome and come to ther hondes wylfully. Tell me quod the Cocke yf euyr thow sawe .xx. Goshawkes in oone hows as is of vs. And for that we be so famy∣lyer with them we be punyshed sore dayly / and that cau¦sith vs to drede them and to fly from them for fere.
¶ Of a byrde callyd Ison Dialogo. lxxiii. ISon as saith brito is a byrde of the kyn¦de of a grype. but she is whyte and les∣se than a gripe / and moste rauenows. This byrde in her yowth hadde doone greate myschefe / and stolyn chekyns & trowblyd both men and byrdes. At last in her age she repentyd and was penytente and wyllyn¦ge to restore that she had mystakyn / and to do penaun∣ce / and to exercise dedys of mercye and lyue rightwys∣lye. But forasmoche as she had my spente her Iuuente and was not acustomyd in vertue. She cowde noon oc∣cupye in age / wherfore she stryuyd with her self & wol¦de fayne haue done goode dedys. But for cawse that she had no good beginnynge in yowthe she cowde haue no good endynge in age / and therfore she mowrnyd and sayde.
He that is yonge and to no vertewe applyeth In age to amende him bad custome denyeth. THerfore it aperith that it is expedyent to gadre vertewys and goode dedys in yowth that they maye be fownde in age. For Ecclesiast saith. In yowth thow gaderist no goodnesse. And howe shuldi∣ste thow fynde any in age. Sone in thy yowth tempte thyn owne mynde / and yf thowe fynde it wycked geue it no power. And a sertayne versifier sayth. He that in yowth no vertewe vsith. In age both vertue and gra∣ce him refusith. And that cawsith badde custome. For as the Philosofre sayth. Custome is a nothir kynde. For the strength of custome is so grete that a man shal do somtyme slepinge as he hath vsid to doo wakynge. And that he hath vsyd to do lokynge / He doth blynde fylde. Wherfor it is tolde of a leche to whom ther was owyng .xiii. lib. payable in thre yeris / and whan he la∣bowryd in extremys and was mouyd to confession and to receyue the holy Sacramente. Ther cowde no woor¦de be had of hym but .xiii. lib .in thre yeris / & with such woordes he dyed. For bad custome and vse false iuges and vocates be wonte to do moche hurte in ther domis and besynesse / and otherwhile they ordir all thinge ful symplye / in ther laste endes / whan they haue moost ne¦de of wysdome. Wherfore vppon a tyme whan the Sa¦cramente was browght to a sykeman and profird him to receyue / he sayde. Let it be iugid first yf I be worthy to receyue hit or not. And they that stoode bye / sayde in thys maner. yower Iugemente is notte approuyd. For ye haue notte suffycyente power / of Iustise to Iuge me by any cawse ryghtfully. An other there was alsoo whyche labowryd towarde hys endynge.
And whan he was warnyd by his frendes to receyue ye hooly Sacramente / he desyred space lenger / and they wolde noon graunte him. For they sawe wele yt dethe came faste on / and he for custome of apelys that he had vsed before / apelyd that same tyme from the opyn greef of that same infirmyte. But his apele preuaylyd him nothinge. ¶ Of a byrde Callyd Mergus in Laten in Englyssh a Dyuedopper. Dialo. lxxiiii. MErgus as saith brito is sayde of drow¦nynge / for it is a byrde whiche sekyth her mete in the watyr and is alwaye dyuynge and therfore some folkys cal her a Dyuedopper or a doppechyk. This Mergus waxyd vnlusty and neglygente and sayd in his owne mynde. What doo I
wretche. Emonge all byrdes ther is not oone yt sekythe her mete with so greate labowre as I doo. For all the longe daye I drowne my self in the pyttes and watyrs to haue my lyuynge. And parauenture at laste I shall peryssh and be destroyde / It is bettyr for me to goo to o∣ther byrdes that be my felowes & to seke my mete with them / and than shal I not be in suche iubardye / nor ete my brede in labowre and sorowe as I do. But I shal fa¦re moche bettyr with lesse labowre. And whan he was flow yn to the feelde and sawghte his foode with other byrdes / he cowde fynde no mete that sauowrid in his mouth / and so he was passyngly leene & hongrie / day∣ly. And notwithstondinge for all that penuryte and hō¦gre he wolde not retourne to his naturall Occupacyon nor plunge him self in the watyr for verye slowth and vnlustynes / but dyed in greate nedenesse and sayde. He is not worthy mete nor drynke. That therfore wyll neyther swete nor swynke. IN lykewyse many a neglygent persone full of slowth and vnlustynes / wyll not labowre / but rather lyue in greate pouertye. Wherfore it is wrytten Iob quinto. Man is born to labowre. And yf he denye to labowre / he dothe not that thynge that he was ordeynyd to doo. And therfore he shall not come to that rewarde that he was create to haue / yt is to meane Infinite good. And also the Apostle wrytteth primo ad Corinthios .ix. He that labowrith shall ete. Therfore thow man as Isidore saith seke to the a prophetable oc∣cupacion / by the which thi mynde maye be occupied. For it is full mery and holsome both for the body and sowle to haue moderate labowre. Ther was a wydow thewich refusyd to be beryed in a smocke that was ge∣uyn her and sayde. I wyll be buryed in that myn owne
hondes made and not othermennys. It is redde in vitis patrum. That abbot arsenye in his begynnynge was greatlye magnyfied in the Emperowres palace. But aftyrwarde he was an heremyte most perfighte. And whan sertayn persones askyd of hī wher in his trust was moost / he answerde and sayde. In this that I ha∣ue exchewyd ryotte and compenye / and haue spoke but lytell. But most princypallye I am glad and reioyce yt I haue labowrid with myn owne hondes & put no man to charge for my cawse. ¶ Of a Carduell in his cage. Dialogo. lxxv THer is a byrde namyd Carduellus which is a byrde of songe and was inclosyd in a cage in a rychemannys place and deyntely fed / for thys worthy man had greate pleasure / to here hys songe. And for that cawse he was plentyuous∣lye seruyd dayly both of mete and drinke / and caryd no∣thinge
for them that were nedye / and within a shorte space ther fell great hongre and many pore byrdes were sore punyshed with hongre and colde for it happyd in ye seruente winter season. And therfore they went to this Carduell and askyd his almysse. But he gaue them none but the fragmentys and leuynges of his Table / and suche as he wolde not ete him self. The sely byr∣des gladlye toke that was geuyn them and made no re¦fuse. But ete it meryly and sayde. Mete that is not comparable to Elys and congre. Wyll serue right wele to them that hath hongre. SOme suche folkes ther be whiche vnto pouer peo∣ple will geue nothinge that goodis / but that yt ys vyle and nawghte. And almyghty God abhorryd the oblacyon of Cayme for cause that he gaue of the wor∣ste / and he acceptyd the gyftes of Abell / for he offirde of the beste. Wherfore Iacob sayde to his children. Bring ye of the beste frutes of the erthe. and it is wrytten pro¦uerb .iiii. worshyppe thow God of thy substaunce / and geue thow to the pouer of the first increce of thi frutes / and also it is wrytten in the same place. Offre thou no small gyfte / for God refusith that is offirde of yt worste It is a greate vnkyndenesse to geue of the beste to man and offre to Godde of the worste / Mastir Alaynered at mownte pessulane / and the knyghtes that dwellyd bye harde tell of his greate clergye / and that he wolde answer to euery questyon. And therfore with a comune consent / they came to him and askyd of him what was the grettest curtesye that cowde be. To whom he sayd To gyue and to be lyberall. And whan they vndersto∣de his answere. They affermyd hit / and Consentyd
therto. And he bad them take ther cownsell togidir and tell hym which was the grettest chorlysshnes that cow¦de be amonge all other. And they layde ther hedis togi¦der and cowde not accorde. And whan he sawe that / he¦rebukyd them and sayde. I my self set yowe in the way by the which ye myght wele haue knowyn the playne solucyon of my questyon. For lyke as geuynge is moste curtesye. So is takyn awaye most chorlysshnes / for it is contrary to gyfte. Therfore ye that continually ta∣ke awaye poremennis goodes / and geue vnto God that is nothinge or lytell worth. ye be moste chorlelyssh and moost vnkynde / as it is sayde / it is more gracyows to geue than to take. In gestis Romanorum it is wryttē of the lyberalyte of Cyte the Emperowre. That on a tyme as he sat at soper he remembryd that he had geuē nothinge that daye. Wherfore he wepte and sayde. O frendes this daye haue I lost / for I haue geuyn nothin¦ge this daye.
¶ Of an vnclene byrde callyd Iuis and of the Po¦ticarye. Dialogo. lxxvi. AS Papye sayth Iuys is a byrde of e∣gypte / and aftyr the lawe hit is the most vnclene byrde that is. For she is fedde with dede Careyne / nyghe the see bankys or floodis / and she pur¦gith her self with her byll / and alsoo she eteth the Eggis of serpentys. Apotecarye toke this vnclene byrde / and wolde haue puryfied her / that she myght haue bene lawfully me∣teable. And he put her in to his Potecarye shoppe / that she shulde smell swete / and be pourgyd with medecy∣nes. but al that sauowryd not with her / while she was there / but rather she couetyd stynkynge careyne. wher¦fore she wolde not abyde / but wente her waye. For her apetite was not to arye ther clennes and swettenesse was. and therfore she endyd the residewe of her lyfe in filthede and corrupcyon as she had before vsyd and say¦de thus. Suche mete as sauowrith to me that wil I haue Of Potecary spyces I wyll neuer noone craue. SO faryth manyon that be vnclene both in bodye and mynde / and customably excercysed in the fow¦le synnes of lechery and couetyse. For they sauow¦re nor desire noon other thing. and yf they be but a shor∣te space withdrawen from such flesshlye and worldely delectacyons. They be soone retournyd to ther synnes agayne as a dogge to his vomyte. Therfore saynte Ie¦rome saith. Wo be him that in lechery dyethe / and woo be to him that in his laste ende makythe an ende of his stynkynge lechery. a fable is tolde that sarcho vppon
a tyme came owte of a donghyll / and flewe in to the feel¦de and was all the daye emonge the flowres of almon∣des / of lylyes and of rooses / and at nyghte whan he ca∣me home he fownd his lemman in the donghepe. wher¦fore with greate ioye and affeccyon he lepte in and say¦de. The swete sauowres and precyows flowres of the feelde be nothinge in respecte of this delectable place / and soo he endyd hys lyfe in stynkynge lechery and cor¦rupcyon where in he had moost delyghte. ¶ Of the Solytary Pellican. Dialogo. lxxvii▪
PEllicanus as saith papye is no great byrde / and he delyteth to dwelin wil¦dernes. Vpon a tyme a Ducke & a gan¦dre made a great sooper to the which they desired to come almaner of Ta∣me fowles. And moreouer for to wor¦shippe the sowpere they wente in to wyldernesse / and brought with them the Pellycan to the same sowpere And whan sowpere was done all tame byrdes prayde the Pellycan to dwell withe them emonge people and no lenger to dwell in deserte in the large wildernesse ly¦ke a Pylgrym. Nor to suffre so greate sharpenesse and penurite. The Pellycan was victe and ouercom with the fayre wordes and desires of the Tame byrdes / and taryed styll with them a sertayne season / and had roy∣all chere and faryd delycatelye euery daye. But whan he shulde praye and be in contemplacyon and redynge of holy scrypture / he cowde not be quyete. For the noy∣se and chaterynge that the byrdes made. Nor he cowde not lyue soberlye as he had before vsyd / for greate ha∣bowndance of mete and drinke. Wherfore he conceyued an inwarde remembraunce of his sowle helth / and as sone as he had oportunyte / he retournyd in to wylder∣nesse and in to secrete place where he labowryd in go∣stely labowre / and perfowrmyd a manly batell agayn his goostely enymys / and endid his course / and obser∣uyd his feith and deuocyon in greate quyetenesse & sayd He that wyll praye and be contemplatyf. Most fle fro noyse and all worldly stryf. ANd in lykewyse thow yt desirist to serue god. E∣uermore whan tyme requyreth take laysar / & be solytary / yt in quietenesse thi mynde maye be occupied in holy meditaciōs / in prayers & cōtēplaciōs so yt
thy sowle maye delyghte in the collocacyon of almygh∣ty God. and harke what Barnarde sayth. O thow ho¦ly sowle be thow aloone / that thow mayst kepe thi self to thy lorde God / whom thow hast chosyn before all o∣ther. Fle from the loue of thinges create if thow desire to be louyd of him that is creator and maker of all thin¦ge. Fle the worlde if thou wylte be clene / for augustyn sayth. If thou be clene thow delyteste not in worldelye thinges. abbot arseny as it is red in vitis patrum praid and sayde. Lorde lede me in to the waye of helth euerla¦stinge / and ther came a voyce to him and sayde. Fle fro badde compeny / be styll and occupye no vayne speche & reste in vertewe and thow shalte be sauyd. He that sit∣teth in solytude and restith. Is delyueryd from threfol¦de parell / that is to saye of herynge / of sight / and of spe∣che. A solytary persone wente in to wildernesse clothyd in a lynnen sacke / and had no mo clothis. And whan he had walkyd by the space of thre dayes he wente vp on a greate roche of stone / and fownde vnder hit greate plentye of grene herbys / and a man fedynge lyke a be∣aste / and he went down pryuelye and made him a fer∣de / and he beynge nakyd fled / for he was shamefaste to abyde the sighte of man / but scantly he myghte escape And the other folowyd hym and cryed. Tary and aby∣de for I folowe the for the loue of god / and the other an¦swerde and sayde. And I fle for his loue. Then he that was clothid threwe awaye his clothes and folowyd hī and whan the other sawe that / he abode him and sayd Nowe thow hast caste from the thy worldely clothing I haue taryed for ye. To whom he sayde. Fader tell me some goode woorde wherby I may be sauyd. And he an¦swerde saynge. Fle from woldly people and be styll of speche and thow shalt be sauyd for these be the princi∣pall
beginninges of helth. For ther as is people is moch trowble. Wherfore Seneca sayth. As oftyn as I haue bene in greate compeny I haue bene trowblyd or euer I haue departyd. And therfore it is sayd. Trenorum ter∣tio. Blessyd be that man that shall sitte solytaryly and be styll. For he shall lyfte him self aboue him self. ¶ Of the Chaste turtyll, Dialogo. lxxviii. CLene and most Chaste is the Turtyl amonge all othir byrdes. For whyle she dwellythe with her husbonde / she louyth neuer noon other. And yf he dye she neuer takith mo husbondis nor ma¦kes. And aftir his deth she euer drin∣keth trowblyd water / and sitteth neuer aftyr vpon gre∣ne
tre nor bowgh. Ther was somtyme a Turtyll that was a wydowe for her husbonde was decesid. wherfor she was greatly heuy and wolde neuer walke abrode / nor take consolacyon. But in greate merowre and lamē¦tacyon she contynuyd and ledde a veray clene and cha∣ste lyfe. and all other byrdes were compassionable vnto her consyderinge that she was lyklye to peryssh for the greate and continuall heuynesse that she made. Wher∣fore they flewe togider to her and sayd. Sister why con¦sume ye yowre self thus with heuynesse and sorowe. Come and be mery with vs a while / for we in the most glad wise that we can intende to cherissh yowe & lodge yowe and doo yowe comforte. And the Turtill knowin¦ge ther good wylles was somdele comforted and went charitably with them. And all the byrdes receyuyd her frendely and brought her to ther nestis / and gaue her parte of all suche vytayles as they had. This Turtil was armyd with the zele of chastyte / and whan she vn¦derstoode the greate fornicacyons that were occupyed there. She myghte in no wyse suffir the stenche of ther lecherye. wherfore she fled and abhorryd the place and wyllyd not to abyde there. And whan she had doone soo oftyntymes / at the laste she vtterly forsoke that leche∣rows compenye / for euer and retournyd vnto the clen∣nesse of chastite and sayde. I will be chaste both in body and thoughte To flesshly corrupcyon wyll I neuer be broughte SO owe they to do that be bownde to kepe chastite For they shulde not onlye flee fro lecherows per∣sonys. But also fro the howsis of them / for the abomy∣nacyon and stenche of lecheryc. For ther is nothing mo¦re stynkynge and hatefull then the stenche of lecherye / and flesshly luste with pollucyons / and therfore Ber∣narde
saith. The apetyte of lechery is full of thowght adede of abomynacyon and vnclennesse. The ende ys shame and greate heuynesse. Ambrose tellyth lybro ter¦cyo de virginitate. Of a moder and her doughters that kyssed eche othir and ledynge lyke a daunce / they lepte all togider in to a greate watyr and drownyd them self for cawse they wolde not be rebukyd of ther neybowris of ther vyolacyon. And saynte Augustyn tellyth a ly∣ke tale in his boke de Ciuitate Dei / of Lucrece whiche whan she was vyolently oppressyd of the kynges son∣ne Tarquynye / she inducyd her frendes to be venged. And aftyrward she was syke and impacyent of that sa¦me synne that was comytted with her / and kyllyd her self. Though she shulde not so haue done / as saynt au∣gustyn saith. For verylye no creature owithe to sle her self for to eschewe the lechery of an other. For she can not be defilyd with the fawte of eny other person / perse¦ueringe in a chaste purpose thoughe she be vyolentlye oppressyd. For the bodye is sanctified or corrupte aftyr ye entente of the mynde. And therfore the detestation of synne / loue of honeste / perseuerance of goostly strength owithe to be commendid in suche as hate synne in ther myndes / thowgh they be compellyd therto bodylye. Of the continence of a chaste woman it is tolde Libro tercio¦de nuges philosophorum. That whan a sertayne per∣son vppon a tyme rebukyd her husbonde / and sayde that he had a fowle stynkynge breth. And he askyd of hys wyfe why she warnyd hym not therof that he myght haue sowght remedye. She answerd vnto him saynge in this maner. Soo wolde I haue doone / but I beleuyd verely that euery mannys mowth had smel∣lyd so / wherfore it aperid be veray lykelyhode that she had neuer kyssyd mannys mowth / excepte oonely the

Ambrose and Isidore saye that it is a subtyll byrde and a frawdelente in so moche that she wyll stele the Eggys of othir byrdes and noryssh them and bringe them forth. But her frawde is not proueable. For whan the chekins that she had hat¦chid here the voyce of ther owne modyr by ther own na¦turall instinccyon they forsake her that brought them vppe and retourne vnto ther owne modyr that gendrid them. and this Partrich mkayth her neste emong thic¦ke busshis and thornis / and leyth her Eggis in the bare
duste. And whan any man comyth bye wher her nestis be. The hennys of them come owte / and shewe them self as thoughe they myght not go nor flye. and as thei myght sone be takyn. and they goo euer the lenger the slowlyer / and by this sotylte they tarye them that thei mete tyll that they bringe them farre from ther nestis. Vppon a tyme ther was a false partryche that stale ye Eggis of an other byrde in her absence. and whan she that had bene absente was retournyd home to her own neste and fownde not her Eggis she made greate sorow and sowght all abowte with a full heuy chere for them But at the laste withe greate labowre / and stodye she fownde both the egges and the theef that stale them / & immediatly she shewyd the mater vnto the Iug▪ and he cytyd the theef / and examyned the mater subtellye. But he cowd not come to the knowlege of the trowth For the theef denyed it vtterly. and the iuge cowde not gyue diffinytif sentence of deth / for ther was no wytnes¦se. And she that was accusatrix sayde to the iuge. Thow owyste to tourment him and to compell him to shew the trowth. To whom the iuge answerde & sayd Thow owyste to proue that thowe haste sayd / that mi iugement maye be rightfull. Or ellys I shall punysshe the with her. But whan noo proof cowde be made of ye matere. the iuge had suspeccyon and commandid them both / to be greuously punyshed / and emonge ther pay∣nes examynyd of the mater. And the theef made opyn confessyon both of that myscheuows dede and many o∣thir that he had done before that tyme. Wherfore the iuge commaundid the theef to be hangid withowt len∣gar taryinge and sayde. He that stelyth and also accusith. By greate sotylte him self excusith.
THerfore begyn thow firste at thi self / and reuol∣lue in thyn owne mynde / and thinke what thow arte thi self that accusist an othir / and whedir thow be not reproueable of that same worde or dede. For it is wrytten ad Romanos secundo. O thow man that iugiste. Thow arte not excusyd / for in that same fawte that thow iugiste an othir / thow dampnest thy self. For thow commyttyste tho same crymes yt thow iugiste. Therfore thow that techiste an othyr / techyst not thy self. Thow stelyste / and rebukyst thefte. thow doyste lecherye / and byddest contrarye / wherfor Caton sayth. Do thow not that thinge / that thow art wond to blame. For it is rebukefull to a doctoure that doth ye same. Vppon a tyme ther was a tyraunte gaue Iuge∣ment that a theef shulde be hangyd / and a Philosofre that was there present / and harde it lawghyd. and he was askyd of the Tyraunte why he lawghyd. And he answerde and sayde. For greate theuys iuge smale And Saynte Augustyn de Ciuitate Dei / Libro primo. Capit. quarto / bringeth in an Example / of Alexan∣der and Dyonyde a pirate. That whan he was take & Alexander askyd him why he enforcyd the see. He an∣swerde and sayde. By fre presumpcyon as thowe doyst all the worlde. But for cawse that I occupye but with a small Nauye I am callyd a theef. And thow namyd an Eemperowre / for thow occupiest with a grete may¦ne. If Alexander were takyn aloone. He were a theef.

For I shall chaunge thi fortu¦ne / that from hensforth thy manhode shall be alowyd with thy good maners. And cawsyd him to be ascribid vnto his knyghtes / that he myght lawfully doo kny∣ghtelyt seruyce / and lyue there bye euer aftyr duringe all his lyfe. ¶ Of the Pye and other byrdes. Dialogo. lxxx.
THer is a byrde namyd Pica / the whiche is the moost subtyll as saith Plinyus / and varyed withe colowris of blacke / and whyte. There was somtyme a wylye pye / that dwellyd with a byrder and cowde speke bothe Englissh and Lateyne. Wherfore the fowler cherysshed her wele and maynteynyd her greatlye. And the Pye was not vnre∣membrid of the benefytes of her kepere. And thowght to rewarde him / and flewe forth to other chateringe bir¦des and sat with them famylyerly / and spake mannys speche. These byrdes were very glad and reioycyd gre∣tely to here her. And they had greate affeccyon to lern to iangle and speke as she dyd. Wherfore they callyd ye pye to them / and sayde to her all with oon voyce. We praye and beseche the to teche vs to speke as thow spe∣kyste / and we shall rewarde the to thi pleasure. To whom the pye answerde and sayde. I can gyue yow no full answer vnto the tyme that I haue spoke with my mastir that tawght me. Neuerthelesse if it please yow to flye with me to him. He shall receyue yow ful curteys¦lye / and teche yowe as I am tawghte. The byrdes we¦re credible and flewe togider with the pye. And whan the pye came home to her mastirs hows / she shewyd hī all her mynde and sayde. Go make redy thy nettis and I shall flye in to them with these byrdes. and the byr∣des harde wele the speche of the Pye / but they vnder∣stoode her not. And therfore they went forth merylye & feryd not. And euen forthwith came the fowler & stret∣chid his nettys / and the Pye went forth to the byrdes and sayde. Dowte not deresusters / but flye withe me boldely. For I haue spokyn peseably to my mastir for yow and he wyll receyue yowe withe goode will. And whan they were all come in to the nettys. The fowlar
wrappyd them in the nettys and toke them / and solde them / and made him self riche and sayde. To them that thow canste not vnderstonde. Geue thow no credence on se nor on londe. ANd so we owe to be ware of credence geuynge to suche as speke to vs subtellye / and be sophemys For it is sayde Prouer .xxix. A man that speketh to his frende with flatering and fayned woordes / strec¦chid owte a nette before his fete to kache him. And in ye same place it is sayde. A false flatereris lyke a Snars to an innocente. Wherfore on a tyme a ryatowre sayde to his felows whan he sawe a pouer man bere a lambe to the markette to sell. Will ye haue the lambe that he berith to markette. And they sayde. ye withe good wyll And he ordeynyd his felows to stonde in dyuerse placis as the poreman shulde come / and euery of them shulde aske if he wolde sell the dogge that he bare. And whan the first had askyd hym / he answerde and sayde. It is not a dogge / but a lambe. and whan thei had met with hym all and askyd so / the symple man beleuyd that ye lambe was a dogge / and so let them haue it for lytel or nowghte. and in lykewyse manyon beleue euery thinge that is tolde them / which is greate parell. Wherfore it is sayde Eccles .xix. Beleue thow not euery woorde. But in euery dede / the possibilite and the ende / is to be dowbtyd. as it is tolde in fable. That vpon a tyme my¦ce made a counsell / and ther it was concludyd that thei wolde ordeyne a bell and it shulde be hangyd abowte ye Cattis necke / that the myce myght here whan she ca∣me / and flee and hyde them self. Ther was emong thē a mows that was veray wyttye / and sayde. I put case that the bell be made who shall hange it abowt the cat¦tis necke, and ther was not oon that durste take it vp∣pon
him. And soo they let fall ther purpose for cawse they cowde not perfourme it. ¶ Of a Kyte that begilyd the wodehennys chekyns. Dialogo. lxxxi. MIluue a Kyte / as sayth Isidore / is a byrde nyghe as greate as an Egle / & hath ceys Fete and byll lyke a Gos¦hawke / but they be crokyd and notte ryghte / and he hath wynges lyke a Goshawke. And he is but weke in strength and not veray swyfte. And he rauenouslye a∣waylith to sle smale chekyns / and oftyn tymes he ys abowte flesshamyls and ther as Careyne is. And as Plynius saith. The kyte is bolde in smale thinges / & ferefull in grete thinges / and ye sperhawke put hym to flyghte / thowgh he be dowble so greate as he. Thys Kyte cruelly cawghte the Chekyns of a wodehenne & ete them. Wherfore Ornix ther moder was sore gre∣uyd
and brent inwardely for impacyence / and neuer wolde spare the Kyte aftyr / but euer enuyed her / and sawghte to be auenged with all her power. And aftyr∣warde the kyte repentyd him and was compuncte and askyd forgyuenesse both by him self and by messengers of the greate mourdre that he had done. But this Or∣nix was indurate in malyce / and wolde not be mercy∣full nor graunte hym forgeuenesse / and sayde I shall neuer forgeue the and graunte the ful reste Whyle thou hast lyfe. Nor whan thou lyest in cheste SO manyon be indurate and nenyr wyll forgeue to them that aske forgeuenesse. agayne suche or sauy owr sayth Mat .vi. If ye forgeue not to men ther synnes. yowr heuynly fadir shall not remytte yowr of fencis. And saynt Augustin saith. Euery creature shal receyue suche forgeuenesse of God / as he geuyth to his neybowre. Wherfore it is wrytten Ecclesiasti .xxviii. Forgeue to thy ney bowre that he hath noyed the / and then to the prayinge thy synnes shall be forgeuyn. For Saynte augustyn saith / that a wiseman not oonly for∣gettyth iniuryes and wronges / but alsoo he sayth he suffyrde noon. and alsoo Seneca sayth in his booke de¦quattuor .virtutibus makynge inquisicyon of the con∣stancye of a wiseman. If a wyseman be smytten what shall he doo. He answerde and sayde. What dyd Caton whan he was smytten on the mowth / he graunted not Nor he venged not ye wrōge / & he not only forgaue / but sayd he had no hurt / yt hī thought most honest saynge yt he cowd. Seneca sayth / in ye same boke speking of Ire / & tellith of Socrate / yt as he went by ye cite / & was smyt∣ten with a great buffet / he sayd nothing ellys but yt it was an heuy cace / that men knew not when they shul¦de do on helmettis on ther hedis / & whan thei shuld not
also in the same boke it is tolde of Diogene the Philoso¦fre / that whan he had talkyd with oon was namyd len¦tulus / and this lentulus was mouyd with ire / & spet in the face of the philosofer / he pacyentlye suffirde him and wypid his face and sayde to him thus. O Lentule I shal bere witnesse that all they be deceyued that saye thow haste no mowth. and Seneca also tellyth that so crates had two Wyuys. The which were very Ielous and contencyows / in somoche that on a daye / they ma∣de a sawte vppon him and threwe him to grownde. and an othirtyme whan oon of them had sore auexyd him / he wente forth and sayde. I fere we shall haue greate thondir after this trowbelows wedir / and set him self down by a wall / of the hows / and she cawghte a pispot¦full of vryne and poryd it on his hede. But Socrates kepte his pacyence and sayde whan he had wyped him I knewe wele that aftyr greate thonder / ther shuld fo∣lowe rayne. and whan his frendes had counsellyd hym that he shulde put them from hym / he answerde and sayde / I lern at home what I shall be in the markette. That is to meane. I lern pacyence at home that I may shewe it opynly. whan a man askyd on a tyme / of theo∣dose the mooste meke and pacyente Emperowre / howe he cowde suffre the greate iniuryes and wronges that were done to his owne person / and howe he myghte he∣re hym self the rebukeful woordes of his enymyes and venged it not. He answerde and sayde. we doo thus for cawse that we wolde fayne bryng dede men to lyf. that is to saye. wycked men to vertewe. For it is but a small dede to slemen that be leuynge. For the smaleste bestis ye bere lyf may do yt as loppes & spidirs / & also venymo{us} serpentis may sone sle a man. But it is a great thinge & possible oonly to god to reyse them that be dede.
¶ Of the Owle that wolde haue lordshippe of all wylde fowles. Dialo. lxxxii. AS sayth Isidore / Bubo is callyd soo of the sownde of the voyce / and it is callyd an Owle aftyr owr Englyssh tonge / and it is a passynge cruell byr¦de and greatly loodid with fedyrs / & full of slowth and feble to flye. And ther is an awtowre that spekythe of her and sayth. The owle sowpith vppe the douys Eg¦gis and hurtyth and cachith myce / and she lurkyth in Chirches and drinketh the oyle of the lampe and defi¦lith it with her donge. And whan she is impugnyd of other byrdes that loue daylyghte she sitteth and defen¦dith her self with her Cleys / and by nyghte she wan∣drith and flyeth abowt / and in the daye tyme / she hy∣deth her self in hoolys of wallys / with this byrde ma∣ny
other byrdes be takyn that flye abowt her / and rob∣be her of her feddirs. For all they hate her and be eny∣myes vnto her / and therfore these byrders take all ma¦ner of byrdes with the owle. Plinius saith that the tay¦le comyth first fro the egge. This owle is a nyght byr¦de most fowle and hatefull amonge all other byrdes / & ther be versis of difference betwene Bubo bouis / for an Owle / and hic bufo / bufonis / for a Toode .verse. Ano∣dyows byrde is bubo the owl. but bufo is a beast moost fowle. Vppon a tyme whan all byrdes had made a gre∣te conuocacyon / and after sowper they wente all to ree¦feringe nothinge. The owle came for the whan nyghte was come and exalted her self and sayde. I am greatly rebukyd and subduyd of all byrdes / and nothinge mag∣nyfied as my noblesse requyrith / but nowe I wyll exal∣te my self. For I wyll nowe with my frendes and kyns∣men lepe amonge these other byrdes / and we shall sle and destroye the gretteste and the rulers of them. And aftirwarde I shall be Duke and ruler of all wilde fowles and byrdes. Wherfore she callyd forth vnto her the porphuryon and the nightcrowe. The backe and the swete / and also almaner of nyghtbyrdes. And thei all togider in bright harneys with greate strength en∣tryd in the nyghte tyme vppon all other byrdes. Inten∣dinge to slee the greate rulers / and by vsurpacyon to ha¦ue the dominyon of the cite. but all the other byrdes we¦re wakyd sodeynlye with the noyse of ther harneys / & whan they espyed the greate treason / thei ran & caught harneys / and toke the traytours euerychone / & brought them all togider fast fettyrde / and chaynyd to the Egle that he shulde gyue ingement vppon them. And whā the Egle knewe this mateer / he gaue this dredeful sen¦tence agayne the traytowris. That euen forth withe
they shulde be drawyn through the cite / and to be han∣gyd. and also that the owle and all her kynrede shulde haue perpetuall persecncyon / and be takyn for enymyes to all other byrdes / and to be banysshed from ther com∣panye for euer. And for this cawse after the fygmentys of fablys all other byrdes pursewe the Owle and crye owle vppon her. Wherfore in the daye tyme she dare in no wyse apere emonge them / but fleyth al by the nyght and sekyth her mete with great heuynesse and penurite saynge in this wyse. He that iuyllry sith shall haue a fall and he that betrayth at laste peryssh shall ANd so in many a greate cite ther is meanys made be prowde people and euyll disposyd to destroye them that be aboue / that they might haue the ru¦le. Therfor such people owith to be ware that they be not pnnyshed as was the owle / for it is wrytten Ec∣clesi .vii. Do thou noon euyll & ther shall noon come to the. and offende thou not in greate multitude of the ci∣te. Nor be not to besy amonge the people. And also it is wrytten Prouer .xxiiii. He that thinkyth to doo iuyll / shalbe callyd a foole. But he yt walkyth lowlye / wal∣kyth surelye / they yt be greate & myghtye / owith to be contente with ther worshipr / & not to vsurpe lordeship & rule vyolently / For of all lordeshyppe the tyme is but shorte as it is sayde Eccle .x. and he that wyll not vn∣derstonde this breuenesse of tyme nowe in this presente lyfe / shall fele great payne aftyr this lyfe / and it is wry¦ten sapi .v. What hath owr pryde profyted to vs. Or what hath the booste of owr rychesse auaylyd vs. All this is fled and passyd lyke a shodowe. and Valery tel∣lith. li .viii. That whan Anaxarchus an eurle had re∣portyd vnto Alexander that there were innumerable
worldes as Democritus had shewyd vnto him before tyme. Alas quod Alexander I am but a wretche. For vnto this tyme haue I not obtayned oon hole worlde. And neuerthelesse within a shorte whyle aftir he was includyd and layde in the space of v. foote. And therfore Quintus Curcyus tellith that oon sayde vnto Alex∣ander. Beware that whan thow comyst to the heyght of worshippe to the which thow labowriste. leste thou be takyn and ouerthrowen with the bowes / that is to saye / with the parellys that longe vnto worshyppe. A sertayne sowldan moste noble amonge all othir kynge agarenorum. aftyrwarde that he remembrid that he shulde dye / he cawsed his wyndynge shete to be takyn and put vppon a spere lyke a baner / and to be precony∣sed and cryed abowte the cite / that of all his realme and richesse and tresowres / He shulde no more carye withe him in tyme of his deth / but oonly yt same shete to wrap¦pe his body in. And therfore all transitorye and worl∣dely worshyppe is lytell worth. ¶ Of the Londebyrdes and waterfowles. Dialo. lxxxiii. THe Byrdes of the londe beholdinge Waterbyr∣des to take ther foode both in the watir and on the londe / were sore trowblyd and came all to∣gider and sayde. we be begilyd and robbyd day¦ly of these Waterfowles. For they be saturate in the watirs. And aftirwarde whan they haue wele eten / they come to the londe and take awaye owr luin¦ge and deuowre it. And so they callyd these waterfow∣les forth before them and sayd to them euen thus. We be greatlye kepte bare by the meanys of yowe / for atte
yowr pleasure ye be refresshid in the waters / and yit ye cannot be sufficyd. But after yowr sufficient saturati∣on ye come to the londe and deuowre owre leuyng. Do no more so / fro this tyme forthwarde. For and ye do. we shall dryue yowe fro the londe / or ellys we shall make some of yowe wery of yowr lyuys. To whom the wa∣terbyrdes answerde and sayde. Sustirs ye speke vncur¦teyslye / rebukynge vs for owre mete. But we praye yowe hartely that ye will vowch sawf to ete with vs of owre delicatis / for owr hartys shal be the meryer for yowre companye. And these londe byrdes herynge the profirs of the other byrdes / and desyringe watyrmete for gulosite flewe forth togider with them in to the wa¦tyrs▪ but for cawse they cowde not swym / they were in greate parell / and iubardye of ther lyuys emonge the floodes and wawes. wherfore they cryed for helpe and socowre. The watyrbyrdes were mercyfull and full of compassion and wolde not yelde a shrew de turn for an othir / but toke them vppe on ther backes and conueyd
them to londe. Wherfore they were lycencyd for euer of them to fede both in watyr and londe at ther owne ple¦sure saynge. Sobre folke dure moch lengerthen glotenows Meke folke lyue meryer than they yt be inuydyows SO many a glotynis sory whan he seyth other fol∣kes ete / thinkinge yt he shall neuer haue I nowgh and that he shal lacke that is nedefull. But God is a good lorde that made the worlde and all thinge that is ther in as it is wrytten act .xvii. God hath geuyn to al thinge lyfe and inspiracyon / and all other thinges he hath ordeyned. Therfore Crysostome saith. God ge∣uyth carnall benyfycys to suche as be worthy and al∣so vnworthye. Therfore we owe to be contente of that god sendyth to vs. For as Barnarde sayth. The moost rauenows byrde is contente with the ayre. The wolf with the londe / the luce with the watyr. But a couetows man wolde rob be the erth the ayre and the watyr / and heuyn also yf he myght for his insaciable desire. But Princes in the olde tyme were not of that condicion / for in them was grete continēce and restrayn¦te of glotonye as sayth vigecius dere mylytari lib .i. Where he spekyth of contynence of princes / and first of Alexander he sayth that walkinge in his iourney with his agid seruauntis he vsid to ete brede oftyn tymes withowte any other sustinaunce / and in the same wise it is redde of Scypion emylyan / and of Caton it is red that he was contente to drinke suche wyne as his ser∣uauntis dranke / that were shipmen & rowyd the ship∣pe. And alsoo of Hanyball it is sayde / that he restid not before nyghte / and in the nyght tyme he vsid to ryse / & in the twylyghte he went to sowper. And in that same place hit is tolde of the merueylows abstinence of the
hooste vnder marke satyrie / that whan an apple tre la¦dyd with applys was in an orcharde adioyninge vnto ther castelles seyn of them / it was so left vppon the ne∣xte daye / and not oon apple mynyshed. It is redde also in gestis Romanorum / that Augustus Cesar was a man of small mete. For he was content with brede and smale fisshes / and Chese / and grene fygges / and he to¦ke his foode in euery place / and in suche tymes as hys stomake was desyrows and neuer ellys. And this gre¦te restraynte of glotonye was not oonly in men / but al¦so in women / customablye obseruyd / for by cawse they shulde be preseruyd from synne and shame. For the be∣ly and membris of generacyon be nyghe togider / and therfore Ierome saith. The bely that is replete withe wyne doth sone boyle and spuyth in to lecherows af∣feccyon and desyre.
¶ Of the Chorle and the Beys. Dialogo. lxxxiiii. VPō a tyme ther was a Chorle / which cherysshed many beys in an hyue / by the whiche he gate greate good / but ne¦uerthelesse he had manye a paynfull townge of them / whan he toke owte the Combes. And it fortunyd vppon a tyme that he had a greuows strooke of a bee / which gre¦uyd hym very sore. wherfore he was right angrye and thretenyd the beys and sayde in this wyse / I promyse yow by God almyghty / that and euer ye stynge me mo¦re / I shall ouerthrowe yowe and dryue yowe awaye. To whom the beys sayde. Thowe Chorle thow arte gladde to gadre and receyue the prophetable swetnesse that comyth of vs / but thow arte loth to suffre any pay¦ne / Take paciently the bitternesse / yf thow wylt reioy∣ce the swettenes / or ellys we wyll forsake the / and thou shalte neuer haue more profite by vs. This Chorle within a shorte space after came agayne to his hyues / and toke owte the honycombes / and forth came a bee & stunge hym sore and thryst in his spere / and gaue hym a greate wownde / wherfore he was woode / and in gre∣te angre he ouerthrew all the hyues and destroyd them and the beys seynge the greate furyowsnes of the chor¦le. They forsoke him all at oonis / and came neuer mo∣re there. and so the Chorle was brought to greate po∣uerte / that was somtyme vsyd to lyue prosperouslye. and whan he remembrid the greate auayle and profite that he had receyuyd before season of the beys / and the pouerte that he was fall inne / he bewaylyd his misera¦ble state and sayde.
He muste suffre both disease and payne. That to haue auauntage is euer fayne. BVt now in these deys ther be many such that desi¦re to lyue esilye / and to be mery and to haue worl¦dely ioye / and aftyrwarde to regne with Cryste in eternall blysse. Manione seke cryste in delytes and pleasure. But as it is wrytten Iob .xxviii. He is not fownde emonge them that intende to lyue delycyous∣ly / and aftir the bodyly pleasure. and therfore Ierome saith. He that wyll leue after the doctrine of cryste and aftyr the gospell / all his lyfe shall be paynfull and ly∣ke a martirdom. For almyghty God excludid not man owte of paradice to the entente that he shulde haue he¦re an other paradice / as saith bernarde. Wherfor it is redde in vitis patrum / that a broder of religion put a question to his abbotte and sayde. Why am I so slow∣thfull sittinge in my cell. To whom he sayd. For thou sawyst neuer the greate reste that we hope to come to Nor the great paynes of hell that we drede. For and if thow woldist beholde them dylygently / and if thy cell were replete with woormys vp to thy necke thou wol¦dist gladlye and wylfullye abyde amonge them with∣owte any slowth. Also it is redde in vitis patrum that sertayne bredren of relygyon prayde and desyred an ol¦de man that he shulde take his reste / and labowre not so sore. To whom he answerde and sayde. Bredren be∣leue me truly. For Abraham shall repente hym whan he shall see the greate gyftes and rewardis of Godde that he hath no more labowrid and trauaylyd in goost¦ly trauayle. Also ther were an other tyme dyuers per∣sonys that sayde to a man of greate perfeccyon. Howe arte thow contente in thy mynde here to suffre so gre∣te labowre / and he answerde and sayde / all the tyme of
my labowre that I suffre here / is not sufficient to be comparyd to one daye of the tourmentis whiche be or∣deynyd to synners in tyme comynge. ¶ Of a lyon that fawghte with an Egle. Dialogo. lxxxv. VPpon a tyme Leo the kynge of wylde beastis fawghte greuously with the Egle kynge of all byrdes. The Lyon hauynge on his syde all maner of bea∣stis / and they stoode on the grownde re¦dy enbatayllyd and ther feldis pighte The Egle truly with othir byrdes toke ther auaun∣tage both on the grownde and on treys / and with dar¦tys and sharpe arowys they fawght with the beastis A byrde callyd Gryfes comynge bye / and beholdinge this myscheef was very sory / and went vp to an hyll
and ther abode / & wold not medle among them. The lyon seynge yt was sore aferde & sayd within him self / and if this Gryfon take parte agayn me I shall be o∣uercome. The Egle also thought in her mynde. This Gryfon hath a tayle & fete lyke a beaste. Wherfore I dowte yt & if he fortifie the beastis / I shal not mowe du¦re. Therfor both the lyon and the Egle sente forth em¦bassatowrs to the Gryfon / to vnderstonde what he was / and why he sate there. To whome the Gryfon sayde / I am a byrde and a beaste / but neyther. H. nor. k Here I sitte for loue & peace. For I loue no percyalyte / nor rumowre. And whan he had geuen this answere he was gracyously receyuyd of all beastis and byrdes And so this Grifon walkyd at his pleasure / emonge them all / for he was not suspect to neyther partye / and whan he sawe oportunite / he began to treate of peace / and for cawse the partyes had no suspeccyon in hym / they compromytted the mater frely in to his hondes / & he gaue sentence yt thei shuld depart fro ye feelde in all hast possible / & no more to continewe warre / but dwell in peace for euer and sayde. He that is willinge peace for to make Must be indifferent and no partie take. ANd th{us} euery mā shuld do amōg ye vnpesible to set thē at rest / yt he may be ye childe of god. mat .v. saith blessyd be thei yt be pesible / yt cause peace to be amō¦ge thē yt discorde. they shal be callid childrē of god. Isaie lii. How godely be ye fete of thē yt shew peace. & so ye fete of mē bering discorde be accursyd. as Eccl .xxviii. ye dou¦ble tongid man & maker of strife is accursid / for he hath troublid manyon yt wold haue kept peace. It is red in¦vit. pa. yt on a tym ther was a gret stryf betwene an he thin & a crysten / & cam togider with ther kynsmen and
frendes euyn redy to fighte / but Saynte Appollony prayde them to be in peace. But notwithstondinge oon that was cheef cawser of the discorde and discencyon / which was a cursyd man and myscheuows lettyd the peace and sayde that he wolde neuer haue peace while he leuyd. Then sayd the holy man. Be it as thou sayst For this daye shall noon be slayne excepte the / and thi sepulchre shall be congruente to thy deseruinge in the belyes of all byrdes and beastis / and so it was in dede. For he was sone slayne in that same fight and troden in the sonde / and there he laye all the nyghte. And in ye morninge his frendes came to burye his bodye / & they fownde it all to torne and deuowrid of Grypes and of other wylde beastis. ¶ Of the Lyon that wedyd twayne of his whelpi. Dialogo. lxxxvi.
IT fortunyd vppon a tyme that the ly¦on maryed twayne of his sonnis / and he gaue to euery of them a gret woode to ther mariage. But or euer he sente them frō him he warnyd them of thre thinges / and sayde. Children kepe ye my commaundmentis / and in especiall obserue these thre thinges / and ye shall prospere and leue merylye. First loke that ye be in reste and peace withe them that be abowte yowe. The secounde kepe ye well this wood which I haue geuyn to yowe / that beastis and Catell maye multiply and increce ther in. And the thryd fight neuer with the kynde of man in nowyse. The eldeste kepte trulye these commaundementis of his fader and increcyd in greate welth and richesse. The yonger trou¦blyd sore with his seruantes and had neuer peace in his howsolde. Wherfor he ranne in to the wodes with gre¦te furyousnes and cruelly kyllyd all the beastis / that were there / and shortely to tell he robbyd all the wode. And at a layser he went to see his brodir / and whan he behylde him in welth / and hauinge greate aboundance of richesse he sayde. I am vnhappye / for I lyue in grete penurite and trowble / and thow arte iocoude and ly∣uyst in greate peace and pleasure. To whom the older sayde / Thow hast not obseruyd my faders preceptis / & therfore these incomodyteys bene fall vppon the / but I praye the to come with me in to the woodis / and se how I haue keppyd and increcyd my faders goodes. And as they went togider ther came an hunter / and pighte vp his nettys / for to Catche of the beastis. Then sayde ye yonger lyon to the elder. Seyste thow not how yonder lytell man labowrith and intendith to destroye vs. The elder Lyon sayde. Knowyst not thowe that owre
fader commaundid vs that we shulde not fighte with man in nowyse. The yonger sayde. Fye on the wretch wylt thow lese thy noblesse leonyne for vayne fablys I my self shal go plucke him on smale pecys. and as he ran in greate haste towarde man and toke noon hede of the nettis / he fel amonge them / and was faste masshid and takyn and destroyed. The elder lyon tournyd ho∣me agayne and sayde with a full sadde mynde. The faders preceptis he that obseruith In greate suretye him self conseruith THerfore it aperith playnly that it is a sure thing to kepe the commaundmentis of fadir and modir and to be obedyent vnto them in all thinge that lefull is / as sayth the Apostle ad colos .vi. Children be ye obedient in God to yowr genytowris / for yt is right∣full. It is tolde in fablys that a lyon was bedrede and laye in his bedde styll and myght not ryse for age. But a whelpe of his which was very strong / yonge and lu¦stye. Came to hym to vysite him in his sykenesse. To whom his fader sayde. Ioye thow sonne and be merye for almaner of beastis drede the. Sauf of oon thinge I warn the. Fight thow neuer with man / for he is stren∣gest of all beastis. This yonge lyon was sore temptyd agayne man and sauwghte him to fight with hym. And as he went he fownde two oxen yowkyd togider vnder a iocke / and he askyd of them and sayde. Be ye men / and they sayde Naye. But we be subduyd of man This whelpe was euer the lenger the fiersar and fon¦de an horse fast chaynyd with Iron and a sadyll vppon his backe and to him he sayde. Arte thow man whom I seke / and he answerd and sayd naye / but he hath ma¦de me faste. The lyon meruaylyd & ran forth & at the laste he fownde an husbonde man cleuynge a tre. To
whome he sayde. Make the redy for I wyll fight with the. And the man answerde. Let vs cleue this tre firste and after that we shall haue layser I nowgh to fighte and with these woordes the man made a greate clyfte in the tre with his axe / and tawght the Lyon to putte in his Cleys in to the clyfte / that it shulde the soner be clouyn a sonder. And whan he had put them in / the mā pluckyd owte his axe / and the Cleys of the Lyon were faste in the tre / and the man cryde owte for helpe of his neybowris. To whose clamowre all men of the towne rose vppe and ran owte / some with swerdes / some with clubbys and some with spetys / to sle the lyon / And he seynge him self in so greate iubardye for haste he lefte his cleys in the tre / and scantlye cowde escape withe a payre of blodye fete. And so with greate confusyon he tournydde home agayne vnto his Fader / and com∣fermyd hys cownsell / For he had prouyd hytte / by experience. ¶ Of the Tyrawnte the Gryfon Dialogo. lxxxvii. AS Isydore sayth Ethymologiarum xxii. Gryfes is a fedyrde byrde / and iiii. fotyd. And the kyndes of these bir¦des be gendrid in eperboray mowntis that is scithia asiaticha / and he is ly¦ke vnto an Egle both in hede and in wyngis / and in all other partyes of his body. He is sembleable to a lyon / and he destroyeth both men & horsis. and he putteth a smaragdyne stone in his neste / agayne venymous beastes of ye mownte /
And he sleyth and destroyeth all men that dwell nere him. This Gryfon toke a greate prouynce to rule. But for his Tyrannye and Couetyse he commaundid thre thinges. First that no man shulde be receyuyd ther ney¦ther to bye nor sell. Secounde that no maner of creatu∣re shulde come thedir from other contrays. The thryd that noon of all his people shuld be so hardye to go to o∣ther contrays. And these thre commaundmentys were obserued of his subiertis / and he leuyd in delycis and pleasure and gadryd greate goodes and no wonder. For what so euer that cam to his possession he partyd with noman therof. But kepte it straytlye to his owne pro∣pre vse. And vppon a tyme by the rightfull iugemente of God. Thondris lyghtninges & tempestis destroyed all the contraye. The dwellers and comprouincy allys of that contrey ran all togider to the gryfon crying and saynge. Go we hens / that we dye not through honger
And he sent forth legates to other nacyons that were nexte adioynaunte to him that thei shuld sende of ther goodes and graynes vnto him / and sell them at ther owne pryce. To whom they answerde and sayde. thow woldist neuer sell to vs noon of thi goodes. Nor now in thi nede we will noon sell to the. He sent agayne other messangers desyringe them to come with marchaundi∣se and to haue fre passage at ther pleasure. and thei an∣swerde. Thow woldist neuer receyue vs before this ty¦me / nor nowe thou shalt not. The thrid tyme he sent to them and prayde them to receyue him and his people / & not to forsake them in mysery and penurite. And they sayde. Thowe camste neuer to vs tell nowe nede coar∣tyth the / and therfore we shall not receyue the / but ra∣ther dryue the from vs and if thow come to vs. And soo forsakyn of al people in grete wretchidnes he dyed with all his nacyon and sayde. He that wyll not serue / nor helpe at no nede. Shall oftyn be indygent and craue and not spede. THerfore hit is good to be curteys and to receyue foraynes and straungers and to vse marchaun¦dise with other nacyons / and to departe the wor¦delye goodes with other / and let them ronne to comyn vse / for owr sauyowre saith Mat .vii. All thinge that ye wyll othermen do to yow / do ye the same vnto them Thus biddith the lawe and prophetis all. And basile saith. Be thow such to othermen / as thowe desyrest to haue them to the. It is red that whan Alexander went by the waye with his oste / and both he and all they we¦re nyghe loste with thurste / oon gaue to him a cuppe of fayre watir / for a greate gyfte / and he commaundid hit to be powrid owte. For he wolde not drinke him self / for cawse he cowde not gyue parte to his knyghtes. But ye
Couetows man saith contrarye. Ecclesiasti .x. I haue fownde reste vnto me / and I shall ete of myn own goo¦dis alone. Suche couetowse men shulde not be preferrid Wherfore in the olde tyme suche as louyd auaryce shul¦de not be preferryd agayne ye comyn wele as Valety tel∣lyth libro sexto / that whan two consullis of rome shul¦de haue be sente in to spayne / and the romaynes toke counsell and deliberacyon ther vppon. Oon Scipion say¦de Neyther of them lyketh me. For the oon of thē hath nothinge and to the other nothinge sufficith. Iugynge equalye pouertye and auaryce in malyciows people. Also Valerye tellith / that Tiberius the Emperowre chaungid but seldome the iuges of the prouynces / for cawse that they that were newe ordeyned were verye redy and intentyf to receyue. An example is shewyd of a man that was wowndid the whiche a greate hepe of flyes coueryd / and oon came bye and sawe them & dra∣ue them awaye. To whom he fayde. Thow hast done euyll to me / for these were full and replete. Nowe shall othir come that be hongrye / and do me more greef. and in lykewyse iugis whan thei be nedy or couetowse / thei be gredye to catche / and desirows to haue. It is red in the fablys of poetys / that a kynge desired of apollyne yt whatsoeuyr he towchid myght be tournyd to Golde / and it was grauntyd to him. And soo whan he shulde towche mete or drinke with his hondis or with his lips towarde his mouth / it was tournyd in to golde. and he was oftyn hongry / and perisshed for lacke of sustinan∣ce. And so haboundance of richesse makyth a couetows man hongry and destroyeth him / it is redde in Croni∣clys. That Taryce a queene whan she had takyn the kynge of perce / she cawsyd his hede to be smytte of / & put it in to a botell full of bloode and sayde. Thow hast
euyr thrustyd bloode. Nowe drinke bloode thy fyll. So shall it fall in tyme comynge to couetows tyrauntis the which desire the blode of the pouer people. That is to saye. Ther goodes and sore labowris. Couetows men in hell shall drinke moltyn gold. As a philosofre tellith that Nero the Emperowre was sene in hell / bathinge him self in sethynge golde. And whan he sawe a greate many of comers bye he sayde to them / come hider ye people that be venditowrs of yowr neybowris and bath yowe here with me / for I haue reseruyd the best parte to yow. ¶ Of a Leoparde and an Vnicorn that fawght with a dragon. Dialogo. lxxxviii.
THere is a beaste the which is gendrid of a Lyon and a Parde saith Solinus and is namyd Leo¦pardus. And the femalis of them be bolder and strengar then the malys. Plinius also saith. Who so wyll resiste to wode Leopardus muste rubbe garlyke betwene his hondes / and withowte Ta¦ryinge the Leoparde goith away / for he in nowyse may abyde the ayre of garlyke. And the Leoparde berith a co¦lowre subrufe / and he is full of blacke spottis / and these beastis be moche lesse them lyons / and yf he fortune to ete any venyme / he sekyth for the donge of man / & etith it and is hole. Ambrose saith. These leopardus be most cruell of kynde / in somoche that they can neuer be ta∣myd to forgete ther cruelnesse. And neuerthelesse they be tamyd / and tawght to hunte / and whan thei se ther pray they be lette lose / and if he cannot catche hit at the fowrth or the fyfte lepe / he is euen wode / and what soo euer come before him / in that wodenesse / he rinneth vp¦pon it be it man or beaste / but yf the hunter preuyde so∣me beste and gyue it him forthwith. For it is impossible to please hym but with bloode. This Leoparde vppon a tyme fawght with a dragon / but he preuayled not. Wherfor he went to the vnicorne and mekely besought him of helpe and sayde. Thow arte goodely and vertu¦ows / and lernyd to fighte. Wherfore I praye the inteer¦lye to defende me from the furowre of this dragon. the vnicorne began to exalte hym self herynge this comen¦dcyon and sayde. Thowe haste reportid of me as it is truly. For I am an olde warryowre and I shall defende the in the beste wise / haue thow no doughte. For whan the Dragon opynneth his mowthe. I shall smyte hym throwgh the throte with my horne. And whan they ca¦me both togider to the Dragon. The Leoparde began
batell / trustyge to haue helpe of the vnicorne. And the dragō faught agayne them both / & spet fire owte of his mowth with greate stench. And whan the Dragon ga¦pyd / the vnicorne ranne as faste as he cowde / willynge to thrufte him throwgh the throte. But the dragon mo¦uyd his hede / and the Vnicorne smote his horne in the grownde faste and cowde not plucke it owte / and there he dyed and sayde. He that for othermen gladlye wylfighte. Is oftyn confondid though he haue grete myghte SO hit is but foly for any man to truste ouermoche in his manhode or to fight for that thinge that lon¦gith not to him / for it is wrytten Eccle .xi. Fight thowe not for that thinge that is not noyus vnto the. Ther∣fore serche thow of thy self within thi self what thowe arte / and what thowe wylt doo / and whether that dede partayne to the or not. At lestwyse thowe owist not to intromytte in an other mannys matere but yf thow be partyner therin. Fight not for an other / nor increce not discordis amonge them that Varye / but doo as Seneca sayth / euer let discorde begyn of an other / and reconsili¦acyon of the. Vppon a tyme dyuers men in harneys pur¦sewyd ther enymyes / and an other man came and saw them / and ran to helpe the man / and stode withe hym agayne his enymyes. And they sayde vnto him. Freyn¦de we profre the no wronge. Take thow that is thyne / and goo thy waye / for we desire to be venged on owre enymye / and not on the / he wolde not be rulyd but ma∣de him self redy and sawght agayne them with all his power. And they had indignacyon of him and maymyd him with ther enymye.
¶ Of the Olefawnte that bowyth not the kneys. Dialogo. lxxxix. ELephas as Brito saith comith of Elephis grece / which is an hyll in lateyne / and he is so callyd for the gretnesse of his bodye. And these beastis be very apte to batell. For the warryowrs of Perce and Mede / vse to fight in Cowris of Tymbre set vp¦pon the ackys of these beastis / and cast downe sperys and dartys / as from a wall / and these Elephawntys haue greate mynde and vnderstondinge / and they goo togider after ther manere / and they fere the mows and flee from him / and they goo two yere with whelpe. and they neuer gendir but oonys. Nor they haue neuer but oone whelpe at onys. And they lyue ccc. yeris / as saith Isydore Ethimol .xii. And scripture that conteyneth ye olde historyes tellyth that the Elesawnte is takyn in
this manere. Tway maydenes that be veray virgins theyr pappis beynge bare / and the ouerpartys of thee bodyes also disclosyd and shewyd goo both togider whe¦re these Elefawntys abyde / and oon of them berith a potte. The other berith a sworde / whiche maydyns with lowde voyce syngynge the Elefawnte herith & comyth nere. And by his naturall instinccyon he kno∣with the innocencye of the virginall flessh / and geuyth worshippe vnto the chastite of them. and as he is lyc∣kynge the brestes and pappes of them / he is meruelous¦ly delytyd and fallyth a sleape. and withowte Tary∣inge the mayde with the sworde smyteth him in to the softe belye / and shedith his bloode and he fallyth down and the other mayde receyuyth the bloode in the potte. with the which is dyed a purple colowre that longyth oonly to a kynge to were. This beaste is very famows and greately reuomyd / amonge all other beastis / and notwithstondinge he may not knele / for he hath no kne¦ys. Vpon a tyme the Lyon walkyd by the wode amon¦ge all other beastis and lokyd on them / and all made greate curtesye / and knelyd down vnto him as to ther souerayne lorde and kynge. But the Elefawnt knelyd not / for he might not. Wherfor the other wilde beastis were inuidious & went togider to ye Lyon / & diffamyd ye elefant. ye lyon cam to hī & sayd. Why art thou so proud & so harde hartyd yt thou bowist not thi kneys befor me as other beastis do. He answerde. My lorde I referre to you honour & worship as my dutie is / I may not kne¦le / for I haue no kneys. ye lyō sayd. If thou refuse not to worship me in thy harte / thy salutacyō is acceptable. for he worshippith his lorde sufficiently / yt labowrith therto with al his possibilite. wherfor ye lyō condemnyd the aduersaries yt accusyd ye elefant. & promotyd him to
greate worshippe and sayde. Noman wrongfully owith punysshment to haue. But his fawt be prouid / for the iuge may him saue IN lykewyse iugis shulde attende to gyue right fall iugement / and not aftir diffamacyon / but af¦tir the trowth of euery thinge. For he is notte alwaye fawtye that is accusyd / but he that is prouyd as sayth Isidore. and also he saith. First proue / and then gyue iu¦gement / Wherof Valery tellith of oon callyd Naulius torquatus. That whan his sonne was accusid vnto him of a trespace / and conuicte of the same / he gaue sen¦tence of him and sayde. Whan I haue cownsellyd my sonne to obserue my commaundmentis and it is prouid vnto me / that he hath receyuyd money of his felows / contrarye to my byddinges. I therfore discharge him of myn hows / and gyue this sentence that he is worthy to be punyshed and shall suffre deth / and so he did. Th{us} a iuge owith to do / for he shulde not do contrarye vnto righte for loue nor for hatred. For Bernard sayth / loue and hatrede knowithe not the iugement of trowth. Therfore Valerye tellyth libro sexto that whan Cale¦ricus gouernyd the comyn wele within a cite / that he made him self / the which was defensyd with full holso¦me and iuste lawes amonge all other ther was a consti¦lucy on that whosoeuer were take and prouyd in the cry me of adulterye / shulde lose both his Ien. and whan his owne sonne was take in the same fawte / and al the cite came togider and prayde for him yt the payne might be remytted. a while he repugnyd / at last he was victe and ouercome with the supplicacyon of the people. But that notwithstondinge he put oon of his own Ien first out / and after oon of his sonnys Ien / and soo he gaue a meruelows temperament to equyte. For he reseruyd to
euery of them both vse of seynge and executyd dewe iu¦stice / and shewyd him self both rightwys and mercy∣full. also Valery tellyth of oon callyd Carandius Tiri¦us which made a lawe / that whosoeuyr entrid among any company of people with a sworde or a dagger abou¦te him shulde dye. And within a while aftir / whan he was come home from farre contreys / he cam in to his owne hows with his swerde abowt hym. And whan he was warnyd of oone that stode bye him of brekyn∣ge of the lawe / euyn strayte he pluckyd owte his swer¦de / and kylled him self. For he wolde not defende hys errowre nor dyssymyle / but rather suffer payne then breke the lawe. Also valerye tellythe libro sexto / that whan a iuge had geuyn false iugemente vppon a tyme kynge Cambizes cawsyd him to be flaynt / and his skynne to be set faste vppon the iudiciall sete / and caw¦syd his sonne to sitte and gyue iugementis in the sa∣me sete aftir the deth of his fader. And soo he ordeyned by this newe payne that no iuge aftyrwarde durst bre¦ke the lawe / nor be corupte peruertynge rightwysnes. For so commawndith the lawe of God / as it is wryt∣ten Deutero .xvi. Ordeyne two iugis and rulers in e∣uery place / to iuge the people rightfully / and se yt they varye not from equite in to noon other waye / for loue nor for drede / but do rightfully and indifferentlye at al tymes to euery persone. ¶ Of a beaste callyd Satirus / which wed∣dyd a wyfe. Dialogo .xc▪
AS it is sayde in Catholycon Saty∣rus comyth of satur saturi penulti∣ma corepta. These Satiri be callyd homuncyones ab vncis naribus / & they haue hornys in ther forhedys / & in ther fete they be lyke vnto gootes and such oone saynte Antony saw in wyldernesse / and askyd what he was and he answerd and sayde. I am mortall and an occupier of this wilder¦nesse. And ther be also dyuers other whiche gentyles worshippe deludyd with dyuers errowre. And they cal them. Fawnos and Satyros. And this Satyrus is a monstruows beste berynge in the vpper partis the ly∣kenesse of a man. and in the netherpartys he is lyke a goote / and he is callyd the God of wyldernes and wo∣dys. This monstre weddyd a wife the dowghter of hip¦pocentauri / which is a man myxte stronge and mygh∣tye. And whan he shulde goo to bedde and lodge with
his wyfe. First he warnyd her of thre thinges / and say¦de / Make neuer no lesynges to me. Rebuke me not. Nor vyolate notte my bedde. If thowe kepe these thre / thow shalt continewe with me in greate reste and pea∣ce. Within a shorte space aftir this Satyrus thowgh∣te to proue his wyfe if she were obedyent and sayde. O wyf tell me the namys of thy progenytowrs. To whō she sayde. I had neuer noon. And Satirus sayde with sadnes and mowrninge. Thow hast sone forgotyn my techinge. and she beynge bolde of her kynrede and fren¦des began to blaspheme her husbonde / Wherfor he for soke her and departyd her from his bedde. And not lon¦ge aftyr she suffirde an Asse to defyle her. And whan her husbonde Satyrus knewe that he iugyd her to be done to deth with all that longid to her / and in her dyin¦ge she made gret mone & toke repentawnce and sayde. Most comendable thinge is for women to obaye. To ther weddyd husbondes by nyght & by daye. BVt oftyntymes women be inobedyent. But ye soue¦raynte becomyth them not / for Ecclesiast. saith, xxv. If a woman haue the superiorite she is contrary to her husbonde / and also he saith .xxi. It is bettyr to dwell in a deserte contraye / than with a striuynge wo¦man & angrye. A man ther was on a tyme that had a shrewe to his wife / and inobedyent / and he chastised her and made simulacyon that he wolde goo to ye mar¦kette and sayde to his wife / in any wyse I charge the put not thy finger in that hoole / and he went and hyd hym in the nexte hows. and his wyfe began to thinke why hath he fordoden me that. I wyll neuyr be somoche obedyent vnto hym / and with greate ha∣ste she ran to the hoole and thrustein all her honde And the hole was full of sharpe nayles / and rents
her fyngers / and for greate payne she cryed owte in so∣moche that her husbonde herde it / and came ronnynge and sayde. Why wylt not thow obey my commaunde∣mentis / and so he seruyd her dyuers tymes in that and othir thinge / tell she was fayne to obeye. In a greate tempeste & horryble wedder in the see the shipmen cry∣ed and commaundid to caste owte the heuyest thinges in the see. And ther was a man in the shippe hauinge his wife with him / which was the grettest shrewe of her tonge yt cowde be. Wherfor her husbonde brought her to the shipman and sayde that in al the shippe was not so greuows a thinge / and heuy as her tonge. Wher¦fore Seneca sayth. As nothinge is more commendable then a good wyfe. Soo is nothinge more cruell than a trowblows woman. And the Philosofre sayth. A wyf is other perpetuall ioye / or an endlesse payne. If she be badde she cawsith moche trowble / and moche gladnes yf she be goode. For goode wyuys be obedyent euer to ther husbondes / and loue them aboue all erthly things Ierome in his boke that he wrytteth agayne Iouyny∣an puttyth an Exemple of thre Matronys of Rome. The which whan they had loste ther husbondes / they wolde neuer take moo. The first of them was namyd Marcya Cathonis / & whan she was askyd why she wolde not take an other husbonde. She answerde that she cowde fynde noman / that wold loue her for her self but rather for her goodes / for parauenture she was not fayre / but she was riche. The secownde was Callyd Valeria / and whan inquysicion was made of her / for what cawse she toke notte the secownde husbonde / she sayde she myght not / for her first husbonde was leuyn¦ge in her dayly remembraunce / and euyr shulde be du∣ringe

The thryd hyght Anna / and she was greatly mouyd by her frendes to be sacryd to the secoun¦de husbonde / forasmoche as she was both yonge & riche she denyed hit / and sayde / she myghte not. For she be∣fore had a goodeman / and yf she shulde take an othir / she sayd trulye that he shulde be eyther goode or badde If he were goode / she shulde euyr be in fere to lese hym. If he were badde / she shulde euyr be in sorowe that af∣tyr a good man she had my sped and fownde a badde. ¶ Of the Dromedarye and of his labowre. Dialogo .xci.
DRomedarius is a beaste as saith Ie∣rome / that wyll goo as farre in oone daye / as an horse wyll in thre. The Lyon callyd this beaste to hym / and sayde. Amonge all bestis / to me thou art moost lawdable. For thow canst well ronne and lepe. Wherfor I wil that thou go in to the easte and inquere of a persone / of the qualyte and company of the Gryfon / the whiche wyll fighte with me as I vnderstonde. Wherof bryng me woorde lyghtlye that I may make me redyeto ba∣tell. And thow shalt be rewardyd aftyr thy labowre both with goodes and worshippe. The Dromedary be¦gan to exalte him self / whan he harde hym self thus praysyd / and toke on him his Iourney / and trustyng to gete more lawde he ran and labowrid owte of mesure / and more then his strength might attayne to. And for hope of rewarde he ranne soo faste and lept that he de∣stroyed him self / wherfore he fell and gaue vp the goost and sayde. Suche labowre as we know / so let vs fulfyll. That be excesse owre self we not spyll. ANd so we shulde discretely do the thinges that we can and knowe / that we hurte not owre bo∣dyes / nor destroye owre tymmes / For saynt au∣gustyn saith in his rule. He that tourmentith his bodie excessyflye / sleith his neybowre / For truly than a man kylleth his neybowre / that is his own bodye. whan he vexyth it and punysshith it more then he maye bere. wherfor Isidor sayth in euery dede owith temperaunce and mesure to be hadde / for what souer is doon withe temperaunce and mesure is holsome. and all that is do∣ne ouermoch and withowt mesure is noyows. Ther is
a fable tolde that a Philosofre with his sonne was in a towre stondynge alone in the see / and his sonne was Tedyows of beynge there / and prayde his fader to or∣dayne some meane that he might go thense / and be dely¦uered from that captiuite / and he fownde ther many fe¦dirs of diuerse byrdes / and he set them togider with pyt the and glewe / and made a peyre of wynges / for hym self / and an other for his sonne. So that thei with ther wynges shulde flye and come owte. and amonge all o∣ther the fader sayde to his sonne. Beware thow fly not to highe. Nor descende not to lowe / but kepe a meane yf thow desire to be blessid. For aracyows and blessyd pe∣ople kepe a menewaye / and the fadir dyd so / and escapid owte of pryson the right way / and was sauf. Then his sonne vnderstondinge that he myghte flye / was verye glad and euyr ascendid vpwarde / and the hete of ye son¦ne dissoluyed the glewe / and brent the fedirs and consu∣myd them / and so he fell and dyed. wherfore Barnard sayth / kepe the in a meane yf thou wilt not lese maner.
¶ Of the lyon that bylded an Abbay Dialogo .xcii. AN excellent Abbaye bylded the lyon for the redempcyon of his own sowle and of his frendes / in the which he or deyned many beastis to be vnder ru∣le / and gaue to thē a rule and a four∣me of lyuynge / and made Eleccyon of a priowre and he was the Fawne / which is the sonne of the harte / as sayth papye / and he is dyuers of Colowre / and the Lyon beleuyd that he wolde be a goode and a relygyows cloysterer. Hinu∣lus this Fawne was variable both in colowre and cō∣dicions. For he set his bredren at dyuysion / and cawsyd them to take partyes / and ordeyned officers / and with in a whyle dischargid them / and ordeynyd other. And they that were put owte of office grutchid agayne him and the other helde with him. and thus he dyd oftynty¦mes malycyouslye. In somoche / that all they conspirid agayne him / and were agayne him all hoole. at laste ye bredren armyd them self / wyllynge to fighte for ther quarell. But a sadde palfray which was olde and wise and had bene longe there spake and sayde. Cece Bre∣dren / for it is not good to stryue or fighte. yit is it bettir to voyde this wycked pryowre / and to install an other that is pesible. These woordis pleasyd amonge the bre¦dren and all they with oon consent put hym down and sayde thus. Concorde and loue is euer to be holde. amonge bredren specyally that partayn to oon foolde
By this it aperith yt concorde is an acceptable ver∣tue / among bredren as it is wryten. Eccle .xxv. In thre thinges ther is gret pleasur to my mynd / which be approbable before God and man. Concorde of bre∣dren / loue of neybowres / and man and wyf wele agrein¦ge togider. For as saynte Augustin sayth. He in nowi∣se maye haue concorde with cryste nor with him self / yt will haue discorde with a cristen man. But ther be so∣me that cannotte lyue while they be in peace. As there was a fissher that trowblyd the watyr / and they that stode by rebukyd him / and he answerde and sayde. If this watir be not trowblyd I cannot lyue. Ther is no¦thinge more profitable to a cyte / than concorde / as oon sayth. And therfore it is good to desire to haue concor∣de / and amyte. Wherfore Valery tellyth of concorde li∣bro quarto that whan Hanyball bese gyd a cite / the pe∣ople of the cyte suffirde so greate Nede / that they eny∣ed oon agayne an other / and wolde not sell that was nedefull to sustentacyon of lyfe / and in that same cite oon solde brede / and dyed for honger. And an othir that bought it leuyd but a while therwith. And this grea∣te mysery fell of discorde amonge hem self. And therfor discorde is euer to be leste. ¶ Of a beaste callyd Onocentaurus that byl¦ded a Palace. Dialogo .xciii. Dyuers monstres ther be / and amonge al other Onocentaurus is oon / which ys an asse myxte with man / so namyd for he berith the likenesse of man in half his bodye / and in the other half he hath the shappe of an asse as sayth Hugucyo.
This beaste for his owne pleasure cawsid a royall pa¦lays to be made / but trustinge in his owne wytte he wolde begyn it. Ordeyne it / and ende it / without coun∣sell of the cheef workmastir. And also oftyntymes whā his connynge workman gaue him profitable counsell for the greate wele of the worke as he vnderstoode by his conynge. This prowde beaste toke no respecte to him but sayde. I am ingeniows and witty I nowgh / it becomith not yowe to teche me. But I wyll haue all thinge perfourmyd aftyr myn owne mynde. And whan the palace was fynyshed and complete / for lacke of go¦de fundary on and wysdome / it was ruynows / and fell shorteey to the grownde. And therfore Onocen taurns was vtterly confusyd and spoylyd of all his goodes / & sayde with greate heuynesse. That man him self sone destroyeth. Which to no doctrine his mynde applyeth
SO many oone wyl not giue credence to the consell of wisemen. But dispose all thinge after ther own mynde. But loke that thow beleue not alway to thyn owne conynge. Nor truste to thyn owne wytte. Nor al∣waye folowe thyn owne wyll / but do all thinge withe counsell / and by the aduice of prudent men and discrete and be thow aplyable to folowe ther doctrine / yt thow erre not from the waye of trowth. For it is sayde Sapi¦ence .xxxi. Do thow nothinge withowt cownsell / and thow shalt not repente aftir the dede. For the wiseman sayth. Prouerbi .xiii. He that is ware doith all thinge by counsell / and they that so do be gidyd wiselye. And this is the difference betwene wysemen and folys. For a foole beholdith but oonly the begynnynge of his wor¦kys / but a wiseman takyth hede to the ende / and to su∣che thinges as pertayne therto. It is redde of a philoso¦fre that syttynge in the Markette in the mooste opyn place he sayde he wolde sell wysdome. and whan dyuer¦se came to him to bye it. He wrote in a scrowe these wor¦des saynge / in all thinges that thow intendiste to doo / euermore thinke what may be fall to the ther bye. and many folkes derided the sentence and wolde haue cast awaye the scrowe. But he conseylyd them to kepe it / & bere it with them to ther lordys sauf affermynge yt it was worth moche goode. & whan the prince of the lon∣de had receuyd it. He causid it to be wryten with litters of golde vpon ye dorris & gatis of his place. a longe spa¦ce aftir it fortunid yt the princes enimys ordeyned to de∣stroy him by the meanys of his barbowr / & as this bar¦boure entrid by ye gate and red this scripture & vndersto¦de it / he began sodeynly to quake / & wax pale for drede yt seynge ye prince causid him to be take / & with threting & tourmētis cōpellid hī to confesse ye trouth / & aftirward sparid hī▪ but al ye first imaginers of yt treson he causid to
be slayne / and put them to deth. Wherfore a philosofre saith. What so euer thow do / doo it wysely / and behol∣de the ende. ¶ Of a beaste callyd rynoceron which despi¦sed agid folke. Dialogo .xciiii. BRito wryteth▪ Rinoceron is interpretate in Lateyne / Horn in the Nose. The same is Ri¦noceres that is an vnicorn / for cawse that he berith oon horne in the myddes of his for∣hede of fower ote longe / so sharpe and stron¦ge that whatsoeuer he smyteth he berith it downe and thyrlyth it. And he fightyth with the Ele∣phant and wondith him in the bely and ouerthrowith him. And he is of so great strength that be no meanys of huntynge he can be take. But as they saye that ha∣ue
wrytten the naturis of beastis. A fayre mayde is or∣deyned and putforth agayn him. Which openeth her bo¦some to him. Where in he putteth his hide and forge∣teth his wildenesse / and fallyth in sleape / and soo he is takyn lyke a man withowt harneys. as saith Isidore Ethim .xii. Rinoceron also as sayth Papye is a beaste hauinge an horne in his nose. And he also saith that Ri¦noceron is a wylde beste of indomitable kynde in somo∣che that though he be takyn he cannot be kepte by vyo¦lence. This beaste for his strength and lustye inuentye myght not beholde nor loke on agid folke. For whan so euer that he behelde any agyd people / he skornyd them seynge them crokyd and impotent. Of very derision he shewyd them his fete and cleys. And whan his Tyme was wastid / and he him self was waxe agid / yonge men despysed him / and he pacyentlye suffirde and say∣de in this maner. He that desireth olde for to be. May not despise age / in nomanere of gre. By this it aperith that olde men shulde notte be despysed of yongmen but rather worshypped. Of this we haue a comandment leu .xix. Befor an horchede remeue thow and aryse. And worshippe thou the person of an olde man. And alsoo it is wrytten Petri quinto. Ionge men be ye subiecte vnto agyd men and Caton sayth. Gyue rome to thy bettyr. For as Va¦lery tellyth libro quinto Capite secundo / of alexander which deseruyd the most principall honowre / and loue of all his knyghtes through his greate curtesy and bu¦xomnes. as he tellyth in that same place that vppon a tyme whan alexander behyld an agid knyght was cal¦lyd Macedone oppressyd with a tempest of snow / he des¦cendid from his sete lyghtlye and brought him vp him self
/ and set him by the fire in his owne sete. also valery tellyth that whan these byrdes callyd Ciconie wax ol¦de / ther chekins bere them to ther nestis and laye them self aboute them / and fede them and norysh them / and kepe them warme / moche rather owith men that be re¦sonable / so to do to ther senyowrs and frendes. More∣ouer Valery tellyth libro quinto. That whan a noble woman was comytted vnto warde / for a greate offen¦ce / and there shulde haue perisshed through hongir. Her owne dowghter that was weddyd by the lycence of the iuge visited her daylye / but first she was serchyd with greate dylygence / that she shulde bere withe her no mete. But she daylye drough owt her brestis and fed her modir with her owne mylke. At laste the iuge mo∣uyd with greate pyete / gaue the modir to the doughter And a lyke tale is tolde of an agid man that was su∣stayned in all thinges by his doughter. Vulturys other¦wise callyd in Englyssh grypes. They be vnkynde. for they suffre ther progenitouris to dye for nede / and they wyl not socowre them. So manyon be vnkynde to ther owne fadirs and modirs / and other of ther goode fren∣des / and the more is ther charger ¶ Of a beste callyd Orix that was longe withowte sykenesse. Dialogo .xcv. AS Brito wytnessith and other Au∣tours also / Orix is a beast in the wil¦dernes / lyke to a gote / of whome the here is reflexyd / & tournith forward contrarye to the kynde of all other beastis. and some say that it is a wa¦tirmows / & whan he is takyn / he is
caste owt in pathis and ways. and some other hath opi¦nion that it is a beaste lyke a mows that we call Gli∣rem / in lateyn as saith Isidore. And this Orix is a cle¦ne beaste as towchinge to mete / but not to sacrifice. This beaste Orix / leuinge longe in moste helth of bo∣dye .in somoche that he was neuir syke / and therfore he scornyd and derided syke folke whan they gronyd / and thus he sayde. These people faynyth to shewe greate sufferance of payne / to haue ease bodylye. And to esche we trew labour. & thus saynge he was neuer seruice a∣ble to them yt were syke / & in langowre. and at the laste he was smyten with a feuyr & became very syke. wher¦fore he began to wepe and wayle saynge. Alas what shal I do. I haue not mynystirde to syke solke but dif¦famyd them to my power. but now yt I am thus casti∣gate with sykenes. I promise to god / yt & if he discharge me of this grete disease / I shal euir gladly serue to syke folke & vnweldy. & whan god had sent him helth & he was recoueryd in ye most glad wise he seruyd to sike fol¦ke and sayde.
God visitith vs here dayly with sykenesse & disease For owr owne profite that we shuld him please HEre we maye euidently knowe that infirmite is sent to vs of God / For our wele and goostely strength of our soulys / as saith the apostel / se∣cunda ad corinth .xii. Whan I am syke / that is to saye bodelye. Than am I more stronge and myghty goost¦ly / that is to meane. For vertue is perfourmyd in syke∣nesse. and Gregory saith. Bodylye sykenes is kepar of all vertue and it is redde in vitis patrum that a sertay¦ne person desyred of Iohan the Heremyte to be made ho¦le of the feuyr tercyan. and he answerde. Thow desirest to be delyuered of a thinge most necessarye to the. For as the bodyes be curyd by medecynes. Soo be goostelye langours purified by sykenes and castigacyons /  whan a knyght vppon a tyme prayde an holy man yt by his holy prayers he myght be delyueryd from a gre∣te disease that he had / and tolde him more ouer that he was more vertuously disposid & more deuout in sikenes¦se then in helth. The holy man answerde and sayde in this maner. I praye God kepe the in the same state / yt thow mayst best please Godde and be moost meke and vertuows. ¶ Of the Comyn Laborer. Dialogo .xcvi. VPpon a tyme ther was a comyn labo∣rer that eryd a felde intendinge to sow¦it. But the oxen eryd not soo wele / as they were wonde to do / but wyncyd & made recalcitracyon with all ther po∣wer. wherfore the plouman bete them
and pricked them sore. The oxen cried owt agayn him and sayde. Thow cursyd ceeature why betyst thou vs that euer haue bene seruiceable to the. To whome he sayde. I desire to ere vp this fylde to maynteyne bothe me and yowe / and ye lyste not to labowre. The oxen answerde. We wyll not ere this felde / for the pasture is good and it fedith vs delycyowslye / and therfor we shall resiste to owr powris. But forasmoche as thei we¦re faste yockyd togidir / and myght not departe / the hus¦bondman punysshed them with prickynge and sore stro¦kys / and so they were fayne to obeye with humylyte / and sayde. Bettyr it is for loue / good seruice to do. than for drede thanklesse be compellyd therto. ANd therfore we that be creaturis induyd with re¦ason / shulde serue charitably whan we owe to serue / and wilfully also / and not constrayned. For coact
seruyce plesith not to Godde. Wherfore saynt Augu∣styn sayth. Constrayned no man can do well thowghe it be good that he doth. Crisostome sayth. The good will cawsith the dede to be remunerable / and without good intencyon the dede is not alowable. And Isidore saith. Suche shall thi dede be reputyd / as thyn intente hath bene precedynge. as it is redde of a iogular that cowde well Tabowre. And he was sene in his Cellta bowringe and doynge worshippe to God. And ther we¦re sene abowte him fower aungellys / with fower Ta∣pirs stondinge and assistinge him / for his good mynde that he hadde to the honowre of almyghty god. ¶ Of the Ape that wrote bookes. Dialogo .xcvii.
AN Ape ther was dwellinge in a good cite / that wrote veray Fayre / & ma∣de dyuerse bokes. But he gaue neuir his mynde / to suche thinges / as he wrote / but talkyd with other folkes or harkenyd what was sayde of thē For the whiche cawse he falsified his bookys oftyntymes. Wrytinge in them the wordes that he spake him self. Or that he harde spokyn of o∣thermen. And so he continuyd and wold neuyr amende nor correct his fawt. wherfor noman wold set hī to wor¦ke / & so he had no getynge & cam to grete pouerte & sayd The wryter that wryteth all the longe daye Deseruith no rewarde / yf his mynde be awaye. SO and in lykewise when we intende to synge or praye. we owe to inprinte owre prayers and song in our myndes stedfastly. For it auaylyth but lytell or nothing to singe or say without deuocyō & applicacyon of ye mynde. ye apostel saith ephe .v. Sige ye in your har¦tys to god / yt is to say. Not only with voyce outwardly but inwardly in your myndes / yt we may saye with ye sayd apostel i. corin .xiiii. I shal singe both with spirite & mynde. Seneca saith. I synge & say whersoeuer I be. Th{us} did Philosofirs yt intendid to shewe & to fynde pru¦dence. Wherfor it is but vayne labour to write yt great study of thē in labouring for wysdom. For ther mighty stodies & labowrs apere by ther wise techinges & doctri¦nes. Of whose Valery tellith li .viii. & saith yt Carnea¦des an old knight & besy & coninge / whā he was passid xc. yeris / he had so meruelously spent his tyme in stody for conyng yt diuers tymes as sat at table for cause of re¦fecyō / he forgate to put his honde to ye table / his mynde was so besyly occupied in remēbrāce of coning. Valery tellith of archimede a philos. yt whā his cite siracusana
was takyn. Marcellus commaundid that he shulde not be slayne / and he stode and his Ien defixed in the grownde / and made dyuers figures / Fourmys and ser¦clys / and to a knyghte comynge to him and holdinge a sharpe sworde ouyr his hede and askyng what he was For the greate apetyte and desire of conynge / that was in him he gaue noon answer. nor tolde him his name▪ But whan he had made many serclys and figuris in the duste / he sayde to the knighte. I praye the trowble not this sercle nor hurte it. and they toke him for a con¦temptowre of the Empire / and neglygente / and so thei kylled him cruellye with the swerde of the knyght that was victowre. ¶ Of a beaste callyd Cameliopardus Dialogo .xcviii.
Cameliopardus is a beaste of Ethiope as sayth Isidore libro duodecynto and Plinius libro octauo capit. decimono∣no sayth that this beaste hath an hede lyke a Camell / and he is neckyd lyke an horse / & his thighes and fete be ly¦ke an oxe / and he hath spottys lyke a parde. This Ca¦melyopardus is a beaste ouerspraynyd with whyte spottis dyuydinge the other fressh colowres that he is lorisshed with. And this beaste semyth more dowtfull than he is / for he semyth sometyme soo tame that well nyghe he may be callyd ashepe / as sayth the for sayde outowre. This beaste was a paynturefull of connynge But he of malice euer faynyd criste to be monstruows to be auengid agayne him. Wherfore manyone despisid Criste and set lytell by him saynge. How shulde he hel¦pe and socowre vs / that hath nether fauowre nor beau¦te. Vpon a tyme this beaste this Cameliopardus stay¦nyd the Image of Cryste in an highe place / and aftyr his power shewid him to be monstruows and despisa∣ble. Wherfore Cryste was pertourbyd / and aperyd to him and sayde. Why doyste thow so presomptuowslye defile me shewinge me to be monstruows / whan I am fayre and beawtyfull / excellynge the beawte of all crea¦turis. For aungellys desire to beholde me and my beau¦tye. and thow labowrist to stele a waye my beawte & worshippe. To whom this beaste answerde and sayde Thinkyst thow not that I remembre that thou haste made me monstruows and not beawtifull nor fayre. And therfore nowe I shall venge me vppon the and ne¦uyr spare to the. And Criste was displeasyd greately with him / and as he was payntynge and highe vpon a scafolde / he ouirthrewe him and caste him down bac¦warde and sayde.
He hath wrought vengeannce in a straunge fourme That on him self the stroke doth retourne. SO manyon be byttir and harde hartyd / that neuir will forgiue iniuryes & wrongis done to them / but euir a wayte to be auengid / wherfore it is sayde ec¦cles .xxviii. He that wyll be auengid / shal fynde venge¦ance of Ged. and therfore Seneca saith. We shulde for¦geue and forgete iniuries. For a grete remedye of wron¦ges is sorgetfulnes. Princes in the olde tyme were ve∣ry buxome and gentyll in geuynge rewardys to suche as deseruyd them / and in remittinge offencis to theyr enymes. wherof Valery tellyth libro vi. of a consull of Rome callyd Camillus the which whan he had vpon a tyme besegid Faliscos. The mastir of the game ledde all the moost noble children of the faliscons by a trayne in to the castellys of the Romaynes. wherfor it was vn¦dowtyd that they shulde be fayne to yelde them self to the Emperowre / But this Camillus was not pleasid with the treason / but vtterly despised it and commaun¦did that the sayde children shulde lede ther forsayde ma¦stir fast manaclyd and cheynyd and greuouslye betyn with toddys with them home to ther frendes to dispo¦se him at ther pleasure. With this great benefices and kyndnes / the myndes of the Falyscons were mollyfy∣ed / and so they opynyd the gatis to the Romaynes Am¦brose also tellyth in summa de officio in cronicis Roma¦norum. That whan a phisicien of pirrethe kynge of e∣pirotarum had come to fabryce that besegid a great ci∣te / callyd Tarentus of the sayde kinges. The forsayd Phisicien tolde to Fabrice that he wolde geue vnto the kynge a medecyne intoxicate / by the whiche he shulde dye / and by this meanys Fabricius shulde be victori∣ews / but he this heringe abhorryd the treason / and cō¦mawndid
him to be faste bownde and caryed to his kin¦ge to be punyshed. wherfor ambrose saith. Verely ye mā¦hode and clarite of him is to be lawdyd. For he yt hath enterprised a batell of knyghtly corage and vertu / wol¦de in nowyse optayne frawdelent victorye. The forsay¦de kynge pirrus this vnder stondinge sayde in commen¦dacyon of Fabrice. This is the Fabricius that is so no¦ble / which is more harde to be remouyd from rightwis¦nes / than the sonne to be auertyd & changid frome hys course / and so the kynge fell at composicion with him yt he had his pleasure. Valery tellith lib .v .cap .i. That whan ye legatis of cartage were come to ye cite of Rome to redeme ther prisoners yt were there in captiuite / im∣mediatly without taryinge ther were delyuered to thē yongmen yt were prisoners to the no nombyr of MMCCC. XL. & all thei were delyuered without money or tribute. wherof great meruayle may be conceyuyd / to se so greate nombre of enymyes delyueryd frely / soo grete goodes forsakyn / & marcye shewyd to so many in iuries. also Valery tellyth. li .vi .ca .v. yt whā pribarna¦cium a prince was takyn by ye romaynes / & dyuerse of his people slayne & many imprisonid & ther was no re¦fuge to thē / but only by supplicaciō. A question was as¦kyd to ye prince / what payne he & his people had deser∣uyd. He answerde. Such payne as thei deserue yt be wor¦thy to haue lyberte. & whā it was demandid of him a∣gayne what peace ye romaynes shuld haue with him & his yf thei remytted ther offence & suffird thē to depart vnpunished. He sayde. If ye gyue to vs good peace. ye shal haue peace for euir. If ye giue to vs bad peace / ye shal not longe haue peace. By the which answer he ob¦taynid not only relaxacion / but also he had a gret bene fitz grantyd to hi & his of the cyte of Rome. For they wer made & admittid cytezyns of ye same cite of rome.
¶ Of a byrde callyd Laurus that occu∣pyed shypmannys Craste. Dialogo .xcix. IN the watyr as wele as on the Londe is a byrde / and is namyd Laurus / And he both flyeth and swimmeth / as saith the glose Deuterono .xiiii. He flyeth ly¦ke an Egle / and swymmith like a fissh And is but a lytyl byrde and blacke / & Fatte. And bydith euyr nyghe watirs / and he may not flye farre. Wherfore oftyntimes men that be swyst ron¦ne aftir them and catche them. And of this birde it ys wrytten in aurora Laurus is a dweller of the watirs. and inhabitator of the londes. This Laurus was a shipman the grettest that cowde be. But euer he ouer∣chargid his shippe trustinge to his conynge. And ma∣ny
tymes his frendes rebukyd him therfore / but neuer¦thelesse he amendyd him not but occupied so styll for co¦uetyse of lucre. and vppon a tyme he fraughte his ship¦pe excedinglye with dyuerse marchaundise in somoche that he cowde not gyde it for the greate burdon and the trowblows waluys and therfor the shippe sanke to ye botome and was brownyd. and soo this Laurus was vtterly vndoone and made greate heuynesse and sayde in this maner. He that couetith sodeynly greate richesse to haue. May fortune to lese moche / and scante him self saue MArchauntis shulde take hede hereto / and not to be desirows of hasty wynnynges / to be sodeynly made riche with grete parell / but surely to incre∣ce to goodes with moderacyon. For Bernarde saith. I wyll not sodeynly be made gretteste but I wyll profi∣te and encreace moderatly fro lytell vnto more. There was a chorle that had an henne / the which layde euery daye an egge / and so he gadryd many and solde them & encrecyd to his auauntage. and at last he thowghte yf this henne were kylled and openyd he shulde haue ma¦ny eggis in her. and for cawse that he was inordinatly couetowse / and wolde haue had grete lucre at oonis / he cawsid the henne to be slayne / and departyd in twayne and fownde noon eggis in her / but loste all / both henne and eggis / aftir the commune prouerbe that sayth. He that couetith all / oftyntymes lesith moche. Therfore marchauntis and chapmen owe to be ware to gete any thinge wrongfully. For the godes of vniuste men shal sone be destroyed / aftir the opynyon of the philosofre yt saith. Richesse lyghtly gotyn may not laste longe. also Prouer .xx. Herytage or lyuelode that is hastyly pour∣chessyd in the begynninge / shall lacke blessinge in the
endinge. Whan a Marchaunte in the see vpon a tyme had solde his wyne which was myxte half with wa∣tyr / for as moche money as though it had be pure wyne and whan he openyd the bagge to putte in the money that he had receyuyd for the myxte wyne. an Ape that was in the shippe espied it / and in secrete wise cam and cawghte the lagge with the money / and fledde to the ankyr and sittinge there vppon / she openyd the bagge and threwe oone peny in to the see / an other in to the shippe / and so she continuyd tell she had caste them out euery penye. In somoche that the marchante had noon auayle by his frawde. ¶ Of the lyon howe he was an hunter. Dialogo. C.
A Lyon ther was somtyme that was a famowse honter / and euer this was his customable vsage. Whan he hontyd he wolde sadly beholde all ye beastis before him / and marke surely oone of the beste / and hym pursewe with all his myghte. But the beaste beynge in goode distaunce and remote frome the lyon. Fledde in all haste possible. Wherfor the lyon was gre¦uyd lackynge of his purpose and faylynge of that he hopyd to haue. And than he labowrid to haue of the o∣ther beastes that he had first forsakyn. But he cowd∣noon optayne. For they were goo and fledde and hydde them in ther couertys. wherwith the Lyon was angir¦de so bytterlye / that he wolde neuer aftyr hunte more / but sayde with grete wodenesse. It is a great madnesse the suretye forsake Of thinge that is sertayne / and the contrary take. SO manyon whan they may haue ye thingis yt be competent for thē. thei take noon hede therto .coue¦tinge to haue bettyr / & therfor they be oftyn deceyuid / & cannot com to possessid of suche thingis as thei in tyme past might haue had. then they wolde take yt thei may not com by / & recouir yt is loste & vnrecouirable. But thei preuayle not but seldom. wherfore thei mourne & be in gret heuinesse. agayn whō dauid spekith .ii. re .xii Now yt he is dede why do I faste whethir I may cal hī agayne / I shal rather go to hī. For he shal neuer retur¦ne to me. It is also tolde in fablys that ye Nyghtingale taught a yongmā yt had takin her to mourne not to gre¦tely for a thinge loste yt cowde not be recouerid as it is redde in balaam / it is but a madnesse and parell to for∣sake a thinge sure and sertayne / for an other thinge vay¦ne and vncertayne / as Isope she with by example that
ther was a dogge went ouer a brigge and bare a peace of flessh in his mowth / and whan he espied the shado∣we in the watyr / he forsoke the flessh that he had in his mouth to kache the flessh that aperyd in the watyr. And therfore he loste it. So do manyon that for couety¦se of getynge / forsake ther sure possession / to optayne yt they haue not / nor neuer can haue. Wherfor Isope saith Thinges certayne owe not to be forsakyn for vanyteys For as it is but madnesse to truste tomoche in surete / so is it but foly to hope tomoche of vanyteys / for vayne be all erthly thinges longynge to men / as sayth Da∣uyd psal .xciiii. Wherof it is tolde in fablys that a lady vppon a tyme delyuered to her mayden a Galon of mylke to sell at a cite / and by the waye as she sate and restid her by a dyche syde / she began to thinke yt with ye money of the mylke she wolde bye an henne / the which shulde bringe forth chekyns / and whan they were gra¦wyn to hennys she wolde sell them and by piggis / and eschaunge them in to shepe / and the shepe in to oxen / & so whan she was come to richesse she sholde be maried right worshipfully vnto some worthy man / and thus she reioycid. And whan she was thus meruelously cō∣fortid and rauisshed inwardely in her secrete solace thin¦kynge with howe greate ioye she shuld be ledde towar¦de the chirche / with her husbond on horsebacke / she say¦de to her self. Goo we / goo we / sodaynlye she smote the grounde with her fote / myndynge to spurre the horse / but her fote slypped and she fell in the dyche / and there laye all her mylke / and so she was farre from her pur∣pose / and neuer had that she hopid to haue.
¶ Of a beaste callyd Tragelaphus that was a False byldar. Dialogo .ci. TRagelaphus that is a beaste of a gote and a harte as saith brito / and it is a nown compoun¦de of tragos that is a goote / and laphs  is an harte / which beaste thoughe he be of the similitude of an harte in somparte. Neuerthe∣lesse he hath rowgh herys lyke a goote behynde / and a barbydde chynne / and hornis he hath also lyke an har∣te and full of braunchis. This beaste was a principall workman and a greate deuisar in byldinges. But he was a false disceyuar / and begilyd many folkes. For whan he shulde gyue cownsell for dyuers edificacions to be made. He wolde ordeyne suche fundacyon that ye byldinge shulde sone fall / and to him self he wolde saye Hit forsith not to me thowgh it fall. For I shall haue
the more adauntage in Reedificacion of suche workys and thus his badde cownsell was robbery to euery mā that medlyd with him. amonge all other in that coun∣trey ther was a myghty tyraunte wyllynge to bylde a meruelows paleys / for him self. And for to haue it per¦fourmyd / he sent for this hedemastir / and delyueryd to hym money innumerable / for the construccyon of the Palace. This cheef workmastir layde a badde funda∣cion lyke as he had vsto before tyme / in somoche that whan the worke was finisshed / the wallys departyd / and Claue a sonder in the myddes / and all the hoole worke began to synke. The Ciraunt that seynge was sore agreuyd and cited the archemastir and sayde vnto hym. Why haste thow deceyuyd me thow cursyd wret¦che. To whom he answerde and sayde. I was dissey∣ud whan I sayde the fundacion / but nowe it behouith to bere downe this worke and make a bettyr fundacion This tyraunte was wode that soo greate a coste was  loste / and cawghte him and threwe hym do∣wne from the loppe of the palace / and destroyde him / and sayde. For cownsell geuynge that is not good. Manyone lesith and is in heuy mood. THerfore be thow ware to geue false consell and wyckyd. For many tymes it happith that thei which gyue false Counsell fall in greate trow∣ble and myscheef / as it is wrytten eccle .xxvii. To the gyuer of wycked counsell all myscheef shall happyn / & he shall not knowe how it comith to him. As Orosius testith / that whan a Tyraunte vppon a tyme had dam¦pnyd many innocentis. A goldsmyth that was namid Pimis wyllynge to please the sayde Tiraunte / made a grete bull of brasse hauinge a durre in oone of his sydes
by the which they that were dampnyd myght be put in to the sayde brasyn beaste / and he gaue it to the sayde tyraunte / to the entente that he shuld include al them that he louyd not and put fire vnder / and soo in greate paynes they shulde crye / and make greate noyse lyke oxen or other beastis. But this tyraunte abhorryd soo cruell a dede and sayde vnto him / that he hym self first shulde entir / that by him / he myghte haue experience / what noyse he cowde make / other lyke an oxe or lyke a cowe. And immediately he was put inne / and pwny∣sshede withe deddely payne / that he hadde ordeynyd for other. ¶ Of a beaste callyd Bubalus that was a shomaker. Dialogo .cii.
VNto an oxe ther is a beaste right lyke and is namyd Bubalus. Soo vntame that for wyldnesse he wyll bere no yoc¦ke in his necke. Affrica norisshith and bringith forth these beastis. In germa¦ny also be wylde oxen hauinge hornis of so greate length / that they be set with drinke vpon the kynges table / for ther greate capacite / as saith Isi¦dore. & it is a beaste of great strength / wherfore he can∣not be tamyd / but yf an iron ringe be fastnyd in his no¦se / by the which he maye be ledde. and he is blacke or yelowe of colowre / and he hath but fewe herys or noon He hath also a forehede of horne desensyd withe tway myghty hornis. And the flessh of him is profitable not oonly to mete / but also to medecyne / as saith Plinius lib .xxviii. Cap .x. This Bubalus was a shomaker greatlye namyd for his conninge whiche by his crafte euyd honestlye / and kepte a grete how solde. But aftir that whan he had gotyn greate goodes by his Crafte he began to despise it and sayde. This is a fowle craste and a hatefull / for euer my hondes be blacke. I sit also continually in filth and turpitude / lyckynge blacke le∣dir and shoone. But I wyll amende it / and be an apote carye / For then I shall be redolente and swete. & whan he was a spicer and shulde occupie his craste / euery mā mockyd him / for he cowde no skyl theron / nether to bye nor sell. Wherfore with in shorte tyme all his goodes ye he had before gadryd / were consumyd and wastyd and he was fall in greate pouertye and made grete heuynes¦se and sayde. Bettir it is in smal crastis wisely to preuayle. Then to chaunge symplye / and of leuinge to fayle
EVery man therfor beware and considre his own state / and lyghtly not chaunge. For the Apo∣stell saith prima and corinth .vii. In suche voca¦cyon as ye be callyd continewe ye in the same. For Se∣neca saith. a yonge tre or plaunte maye not grow / that is oftyn remeuyd. For perseueraunce is callyd a stable and perpetuall mansyon / ordeynyd wele in reason. and as Tully writeth primo rethorice. The nobilite of mā shulde dwell in this perseueraunce. That is to saye. Not to be brokyn with aduersiteis / nor to be exaltid with prosperiteys. Nor to be feryd with comynacyons and thretingis. Nor also to be inclynyd or bowyd from vertue by promes or adulacyōs. For Seneca also saith denaturalibus questionibus libro tertio. And also as the expositor super boecium deconsolatione saith / that the philosofirs layde or cowchyd two Tonnes of wy∣ne in the entrey of the hows of Iouys / and aftir the de¦claracyon of the sayd expositor. The hous betokenyth this worlde present / the two tonnys prosperite and ad∣uersite. Of which it behouith euery creature to taste en¦tringe in to this worlde. Alexander myght not ouerco¦me the constaunce and perseueraunce of Diogenes. For whan he came to him on a tyme sittinge in the son¦ne and bad him desire what he wolde / and accordinge to reason he shulde haue it. This Diogenes answerde with greate stedfastnes and sayde. I wolde quod he be¦fore all othir thinges that thow kepe not the sonne fro¦me / that is to meane / that thou stonde not betwene me and the sonne. and so hereof came a prouerbe. That a∣lexander attemptid to haue put diogenem from his de¦gre of stablenes / but it was more esy to him to depriue kynge Dary from his Roall see / by force of armis. and therfore saith Seneca libro quinto de beneficiis that
Diogenes was moche strenger and richer than alexā¦der hauinge al the worlde. For it was more yt he frely refusyd / than euer ye other might gyue. & therfore that day Alexander was victe for he founde suche a man to the which he cowde nothinge gyue nor take awaye. The olde philosofirs dispysyd all temporall thinges / and reputyd them to be vyle and of no valowre. wher¦fore a Philosofre weppyd for he sawe men labowring and trauelynge with so greate dylygence / abowte ther feeldis / vynes and how singes as though in them were perpetuall blysse. An other philosofer euer lawghid de¦ludid / and scornyd men of the worlde for that cawse yt ther felycite restyd in flesshly delectacyon continually and inloue of thinges transitorye of this mortall lyfe. Wherfore it is wrytten Iere. li. Euery man is a foole of his owne conynge / and euery man is confusyd of his owne sculptyle. Sculptile is callyd that thinge which a man louyth beste / and settith most price bye in thys worlde.
¶ Of a steere that was a good Cooke. Dialogo .ciii. IVuencus is a yonge oxe / whan he is no lenger a calf / and he is then callyd a steere whan he begynneth to be help∣full vnto the profit of man in eringe ye erth. This iuuencus was a speciall go¦de Coke / for he cowde make dyuers go¦de dysshes and delicate. But his connynge was moche the lesse alowyd for he ouersaltyd his mete / & destroyd it. Wherfore his lorde callyd him before him and sayde Why destroyest thow my mete that is so sumptuous / and delicate / with vnmesurable salte. And this Co∣ke answerde and sayde. I salte it well for it sauowrith & relecith ye bettyr in my mouth. Seynge his mastir yt he wolde not amende for his greate glotonye he all to bete him and put him owte of his seruyce / and soo he was expulsyd fro manye goode seruyce / and atte the laste for his insaciable glotonye / and inordinate apety¦te of vnmesurable sauowre he was kyllyd / and wret∣chydly dyed and sayde. Many moo people / be glotonye is slayne. Then in batell or in fight or with othir payne. IN lykewyse many glotowns will nothing but that pleasith to them self and suche as they de∣sire. And they that folowe ther owne gloto∣nows apetyte / be lyke vnclene beastis. Wherfore Se∣neca saith. Obedyent people vnto the belyes / haue the lykenesse of vnclene beastis / & not of resonable creatu∣ris / but as the glose saith. Not the mete but the fowle apetyte causith ye synne. It is gretly culpable to a cry∣sten man to worship his bely as a god / & for concupis∣cēs & apetyt of glotony / to expulse & destroy ye vertewis
of the sowle. For Galiene saith. Concupiscens of me∣tys by hurte to the sowle and cawsith goostly fayntnes¦se. For truly howe moche any persone is replete bodyly with metys / so moche more goostly is he mynysshed in vertewys. and ypocrates sayth. The more largelye thow fedist thi corruptiblye bodye / the more thow hur¦tist it. In fraunce somtyme was an abbotte the which dayly was seruyd delicatly / and ete of the beste / and ri¦chesse he lackyd noon. But he was euir sike and cowde not be repayrid with medecynys. Wherfore he was in desperacyon of his lyfe / and toke vppon him the ordyr of cisterciense / in the which for parcyte and scarcenesse of mete he amendid and was hole / and stronge. Wher¦fore Galiene saith. abstynence is most excellent mede∣cyne. and also it is wrytten ecclesia .xxxvi. He that is abstinent shal encrece his lyfe. It is red that a sertayn people callyd bragmaynes wrote vnto alexander and sayde .it is vnlefull to vs to haue owr belyes straynyd with metys / and therfore we be withoute sykenesse / & lyue longe. We be very hole and haue neuyr nede of me decyne / and these people desirid nothinge of alexander sauf immortalite / which they lackyd / and he cowde not gyue it to them. Ther was in owre dayes an agid man which leuyd many yeris. and whan it was askyd of hī why he had so greate helth and leuyd so longe / he an∣swerde and sayde. For I neuer rose fro Table soo reple¦te that my bely was greuyd. Nor I neuer vsyd to be let bloode. Nor I knew neuer woman flesshly. For the¦se thre cawsis I haue hadde helthe / and contynua∣wnce of lyfe.
¶ Of a beaste callyd Capreolus ye which vsyd to iogle. Dialogo .ciiii. CApreolus suche a beaste ther was som¦tyme / that cowde most sotelly iogle. he cowde also singe very wele / dawnce also and talke plesauntly. Neuerthe∣lesse he was the more eschewyd of all people for that he occupied excedingly And therfore he leuyd but pouerlye. And vpon a tyme he went to the kynge and sayde. My lorde moost soue∣rayne ye knowe wele that I am a connynge iogular & passe all other in your realme / but for al that I am not gladly harde in yowr realme. nor rewardyd aftyr my connynge. But fewe or noon can iowgle so crastely as I can / and notwithstondinge they be take forth and lar¦gely rewardyd. Tell me the cause. To whom the kyn¦ge answerde. As thow sayst thow canst iowgle wele /
but this is thy fawte. Thow doyst al thinge excessyf∣lye both in doynge and in saynge / Wherof the herars be fastydyows and werye. But and yf thow wylte be gladly harde. Stody thow to speke and to iowgle tem∣peratly. This Capreolus did aftir counsell / and was verely wele amendyd in his goodis in shorte tyme af∣tyr and leuyd meryly all his dayes and sayde. Playes and desportys be acceptable and goode. Temperatly vsyd / and in a meane moode. SO we owe to do such thingis as we knowe and can with temperaunce / that we cawse not we∣rynesse to the beholders / for Isidore saithe. All thinge that is ouermoche and without mesure done .cawsith werynesse / and a sertayn versisier saith. The wordes of them be not acceptable. That euer be talkin¦ge for ther saynges be not stable. For the why stelynge byrder makyth mery songe. and yit the sely byrdes be∣gylyth he amonge. A childe askyd a question of an old man and sayde. Fadir is it bettir to speke or be styll. to whom the olde man spake and sayde. If the woordes be vnprofitable leue them. If they be goode. Differre not longe to speke them .it is wryten eccle .xxxii. yonge man make but lytell speche in thyn own cawse. If thou be twyes interogate and askyd a question / haue thou re¦dy thyn answer in thy mynde or thow speke. Ther as be senyowrs be thow not verbose / and amonge agyd folke cast not out thi speche. In vitis patrum oon ma∣de a question to an olde man and sayde. How longe shal I kepe spilence. To whom he sayde. Tell thou be spo∣kyn to. In euery place if thow be styll thou shalt haue reste / and kepe thou scilence vnto a tyme of conueniēce Temestides a philosofre sayd to a chorle yt sate with hī  dyner / & spake not. Art thou lernyd / me thinketh soo
for thou spekist not. Therfore Isidore saith. Whan ty∣me requireth speke thou / & in tyme be styl / & speke not but if thou be spokyn to first. and also here thou al thin¦ge paciently or thou speke / & the question of an othir mo¦re euer precede & cawse the to gyue a resonable answer. ¶ Of the hare that was a lawyer. Dialogo .cv. THe hare Lepus went to pareys to scole & was in processe a good lawyer / and therfor he went to the lyon and sayde. My lorde I haue spent & consumyd my goodes in studye and scolage / for connynge and science. wherfore I pray yow that I may be wele maynteyned & stypendyd / and lyue worshipfully vnder the proteccyon and shadow of your wynges. To whō the lyon answerde. I will first make a profe of thi wysdom & conynge or I grante ye thi desire
Go with me to see dyuers thinges that I maye proue thy lernynge. and as they wente by a wode syde there came an hunter hauinge a bowe and ārowis / and or∣deynyd to shoote aftyr the bere and the foxe. But the foxe was wylye. And whan she espied the bowe and the arowe she lepte a syde and escapid fro the stroke. The bere was prowde & trustyd to his owne strength and came hastely agayne the man willyng to teere him on pecys / but the hunter losyd his arowe and smote yt bere and kylde him. This seinge the lyon sayde vnto the hare. Make me a prouerbe of this that I may kno¦we thi science. yf thow desire to be admytted to my sa∣larye. The hare wrotte immedyatelye in his booke / and sayde. Agayne deth it preuaylith moch more amonge. To haue wysdome / than to be stronge. ANd the lyon commendyd this prouerbe and led the hare with him / to a cyte / where they fown¦de a lorde rebukynge his seruauntis. and oone of the seruauntis toke pacyentlye the rebukys of his mastir. The other was impacient and not sufferable / but full of frowarde answers. Wherfore the Lorde in his ire all to bete him and spoylyd hym and expulsyd him owte of seruice / and kepte styll the pacyent and pro¦motyd him to greate worshippe. And of this matere ye hare wrote to the lyon saynge in this wise. Moche bettyr it is many tymes to be styll Then to speke shrewdlye / and haue iuyll wyll THe Lyon also magnifyed greatly this prouerbe and ledde the hare in to a towne. In the whiche they fownde a laborer yockynge his oxen / and assygnyd them to ther iourney to ere .xii. acres of londe and delyuerid for the fedinge of euery of them a botell
of hay. Oon of these beastes went forth and bare his bo¦tell of haye withowte grutchinge / and an othir began to speke boldlye and prowdly and sayde. What shulde hit suffice vs to bere haye with vs. He shall not fede vs so. and thus saynge he wolde not cary haye to fede hym self with him. And whan they came to ther labou¦re / and had eryd vnto euyn he that had the botell of haye refresshid him self. The othir was werye and ha∣uinge nothinge wherof to be comfortyd for greate hon¦gre he dyed. Wherof the hare wrote to the Lyon sayn∣ge in this wise. Bettyr it is at nede lytell thinge to haue. Than vtterly nothinge that myght the lyfe saue. THe lyon consyderinge all this / sayd vnto the ha¦re. Trewly sonne thow hast studyed wele / & loste no tyme in vayne. For thou canst answer wisely to euery question. Wherfore he gaue him great wagis and promotyd him and sayde. He that of honowre desireth to haue a chayre. Owith to be connynge / and of very wysdome ayre. STudyentis shuld take hede hereto / & continually apply them to haue connynge / that they maye be promotyd / For the mynde of man ioyeth and is fed with connynge / and therfore it owith to haue noon en∣de / as Seneca saith. Be not faynte in lernynge / for lyfe and lernynge shulde ende at onys / and an othyr saith. If my foote were in my graue / yit wolde I gladly lern connynge. For connynge and science is desirable both for it self and for other / for it is veray profitable to ma∣ny thinges as saith the expositor vppon the firste of the ethikes. And that man is very blessyd that hath foun¦de wysdome / and haboundith with prudence. Prouer .iii. Therfore olde princes had ther mastirs / as traiana
had plularchum. Nero had Scneca / & alexander had Aristotyll. Whan Alexander was born philippe the fa¦dir of him wrote an Epistle to aristotyl sayinge in this wise. Philippe to aristotyll sendith gretinge. knowe thow that a sonne is born to me / wherof gretly I reioy¦r and referre gracys vnto the goddes. Not oonly for cawse of his byrth. But rather for that it fortunyth him to be borne in thy tyme For my gret confidence re¦syth in the / trustinge that thow shalt bringe hym vp in vertewe and doctrine / that he maye be worthy to be a gydar / & profitable to the wele of or reame. And hit is to be notyd that a prince of a reame owith to be wy∣se / not oonly in disposinge of thing is temporall and la¦wys of them. But also in dyuyne thingis and lawys of god as it is wrytten Deuteromii .xvii. Aftyr that a kynge haue possession and is sette in the Trone of his ame / he shal cawse the Deutronomye to wryte vnto hym of the lawe in a volume / takynge an example of the presris of the trybe Leuiticall / and it shall Remayne in his kepinge / and he shall rede it all the dayes of his lyfe / that he may lern and haue remembraunce to drr∣be his lorde God and kepe the cerymonyes of hī which be commaundyd in the lawe. and if the prince be not let tyrde. It is necessary to him to be counsellyd of suche as be lernyd wherfore he is commawndid to take an ex∣amplar of the lawe of preystis and men of the chirche as Helinandus expownyth. Tully saith in detuscula¦nis questionibus libro quinto. Philosofir is a serchar of the mynde / which drawith owte vicis by the rote / and purgith them / & makith redy ye sowlys to bringe forth goode frute. Papie saith that academia / was somtyme a towne oftyn tymes shakyn with erth quauys ston∣dinge but a myle from athenys / which town philoso∣firs
that is to saye plato & al his / chose to dwell inne / yt drede shulde cawse them to be continent and to be dou∣tefull euir / & eschewe othir vices / & aplye ther lernyge and of that town they were namyd Academici. ¶ Of a Dogge and many Woluys Dialogo .cvi. A Dogge which was a grete barkar & enymye agayne woluys to fight a∣gayne them was keppid in a greate cite / and he was so fierse that in no∣wise he wolde suffir them to entyr ye cite. Wherfore the woluis hatid the dogge and laye dayly waytinge to de¦stroye him. and for that same intente thei came togider in to the feldys and sent forth two of the eldest of them inmessage to the dogge saynge vnto him. Thou arte mighty & goodly strōge & vertuous. & therfor al we be assemblyd togider in ye feeldis to crowne ye our kynge.
come with vs peseablye and receyue thy dignite that thow mayst be honowrably put in possession. This dogge was madde for ioye whan he harde him self th{us} lawdyd and thoughee he shulde be exalcyd and depar¦tyd from the courtelage in which he had sure abydyn∣ge and went forth with his enymyes to his coronacyon The woluys conueyde the dogge secretly to ther owne companye / and whan they espyed hym / they fortified them self togider and all to rente the dogge and sayde. He that desireth to be hardy and bolde. Shulde euer dwell styll in a stronge holde. SOo a man yt dwellith in a strong place / owithe not to departe thens for fayre promi & flaterin¦ge woordes. For ther be many deceyuers / decey¦inge thē yt be not ware with sugryd woordes / wherfor Albartanus saith. Thou shalt not drede byttyr woor¦des but rather grete strokis. The Philosofre saith. He that wysely dissimulith / the soner preuaylith agayne his enymye. & Isope wyllynge to shewe that a man o∣with prudently to consider why and for what cause any¦thinge is promysed or geuyn to him tellyth & inducith a fable and saith that on a tyme a theef came to a man¦ys hows by night to robbe him / & a dogge which was in yt same hows barkyd & made grete noyse. but ye theef was subtyll & pluckyd brede out of his bosome & gaue it to ye dogge to cawse him / to be styll.

¶ Of the Wolf and the Asse. Dialogo .cvii. THe wolf on a tyme sawyd with the asse / but ye asse labowrid full truly aboue. the wolf was malycyous and drewe the sawe vndernethese kynge an Occasyon to deuowre the asse. wher¦fore he made quarell agayne him and sayde. Why doyste thow throwe the duste in to myn Ien. the asse answerde / and sayde. I doo not so to the / but I go∣uern the sawe perfightly aftyr my wytte and connyn∣ge. If thow wilt sawe aboue I am pleasyd / and I shal labowre beneth trulye. To whom the wolf sayde I can nor. But and yf thow throwe any more duste in to myn Ien / I shal put owte both thyn Ien. and they thus sa∣wynge the wolf blewe with all his power wyllynge yt the duste shulde flye in to the Ien of his felowe / but ye tymber stoppid it / and cawsid the dust to fall in to the Ien of the wolf / and he was greuously paynid and swa¦re that he wolde ouirthrowe the portars and berars. But the tymber fell sodeynly by the right full iugemēt of God and oppressed the wolf and kylled hym. The asse lept and sauyd him self and sayde. Manyone that thinkith his Neybowre to kyll Is slayne with that same swerde sore agayn his wil THus doo malycyows people that layenettis to deceyue ther neybowris / and to take them. But as it is wrytten Eccle .xxvii. He that ordeynith a pitte for his Neybowre shal fall in to it him self / as I∣sope inducith a fable & shewith yt he yt labowrith to dis∣ceyue othir folkes / god shall suffir him to be begilyd & dampnyd / and forth he bringeth an example and saith That on a tyme a mous came to a grete waterside / and
durste not swym ouir / and a frogge espied him / and thoughte to deceyue him / and sayde. Thou art welco∣me brodir and frende. It is sayde that frendeship is pro¦uyd in necessite. Wherfor come with me / for I can swym right wele. The mous trustid wel & suffirde him self to be fast bownde to the foote of ye Frogge and as they swam the frogge descendyd in to the watir and drow∣nyd the mous & kylled her. and at the laste ther came a kyte fleynge ouir and espied the mows and caught her and the Frogge also and ete them both. and therfore saith Isope. So mote they perissh / yt wil speke fayre and deceyue / for it is worthy that punysshment retourne to him that causith it. ¶ Of the bere and the wolf. Dialogo .cviii
VPpon a tyme the bere callyd the wolf to him and sayde. We twayne be had in greate reputacion and haue a greate name emonge all othir wylde beastis. But and if we take owr lodgynge to∣gider and lye in oone mansion nyght∣lye / we shall be more louyd and dredde of them all then webe. These woordes pleasid vnto the wolf and they made compenye and dwellyd togidrr. The bere gaue in¦formacion to the wolf and sayde. I will continewe glad¦lye with the in somer for thow shalte fede me with su∣che vytayle as thow mayste gete by thy huntynge. And I shal cherissh the in my Cell / for I am very well purueyde in the wynter. I wyll not that thow shalt be withowte in the wynter in the froste and the cold. But rather cōtinew with me in my caue & make good chere The wolf beleuid well / and with all his dilygence day he went an huntinge to fede him self and the bere. The bere lyuyd myrylye withowte labowre. And whan the wolf came to his Cell / the bere broughte him to his ca¦ue. But there fownde he nothinge. wherfor he was gre¦tely sory and verye hongrye. The bere lycked him self and was well refresshed & toke noon hede of the wolf wherfore the wolf spake and sayde. what is there here to ete / why hast thow disseyuid me thus. The bere say¦de. Sit downe and lycke thi self yf thou lyft / and ellys goo whedir thow wylte. The wolf was deceyued and with greate mourninge retournyd agayne to the wode and sayde. Euermore wysely a prose let vs make. Or we to owr how solde any personys take.
WE shulde preue our frendes / or we gyue creden¦ce vnto them / for no man that is wyse shulde disclose to his frende the secretnesse of his myn¦de but if he be assuryd of him and haue prouyd him be∣fore / as it is wrytten Ecclesi .xi. Bringe not euery mā in to thi hows / that is to meane. In to thy mynde / by hastye credence geuinge for the worlde is replete with greate soteltye. And also it is wrytten in the same pla∣ce. If thow haue a frende / proue hym in thy trowble / & be assuryd of him or thow shewe him all thy mynde. For certaynly a prudent man and discrete shulde notte to hastyly gyue credence to his frende but aftyr he hath prouyd him and founde him faithfull he may the more largely committe truste vnto him. Wherfore Valerye writeth libro tertio cap .viii. of Alexander kinge of ma¦cedone. That whan Philippe Phisicien vnto the say∣de alexander and his perfightly prouyd frende / shulde gyue him a drinke / ther were lettirs sente to alexander conteynyge that the sayd Philippe was corrupte with money of kynge Darye and he had put venyme in the medecyne. which lettres whan Alexander had redde / he dranke first the medecyne / and aftirwarde immedi∣atlye he delyuerid the lettyrs to Philippe to rede / ha∣uinge in him so greate confidence / that in nowyse he cowde mystruste him. Therfore we shulde eschewe to be knytte to any personne in fauowre and amyte before a dew preef. For the Philosofir saith. Beware thou of frendes not prouyd and Seneca saith. Take delybera¦cion with thi frende / but first with thy self / for euery fe¦lowe is not good nor faith full. Therfore discrecyon mu¦ste discerne the goode from the badde .it is tolde that on a tyme twey felows went togider by the waye. To whom a bere sodaynly mette and made on them a grate
sawte. For drede oon of them scandyd a tre. The othir laye flatte on the grounde faynyge him self to be dede The bere went to him that laye lyke dede and demyd he had be dede / and departyd from him and went hys waye. His felowe descendid whan the bere was goone and askyd of his felowe what the bere had sayde to hī in his ere / and he sayde. The bere counsellyd me to be¦ware of suche a felowe that hath forsake me in so gre∣te a iubardye. And it is to be notyd that enymyes that offende eyther to othir to the vttermoste that they can they maye neuer haue sure and continuall peace togi∣der aftir. Wherof an example is tolde of a chorle that had but oone sonne. And vppon a tyme he lycencyd hī to goo to a place and playe. and a serpent bote him / and kylled him / and he was buryed and a signe set vppon his graue. The sayde chorle lay dayly in a wayte and be thought him howe he myght sle the serpente / and at laste fownde him and in greate angir smote at hym wyllynge to haue kyllyd him. But the serpent fledde in to an hole / and he smote of his tayle. And ther grew inextinguible hatrede betwene the chorle and the scrpē¦te. The chorle at laste spake of peace / but the serpente answerde and sayde. It may not be that thow spekyste of. For as longe as thou seyste the graue of thisonne / & as oftyn as I beholde my Tayle cut of / ther shall ne∣uer betwene vs by perfite peace nor concorde. ¶ Of the wylde gote and the wolf. Dialogo .cix.
OAmula as saith Papie is a female go¦te of the wyldernesse. This gote war¦chid on a nyght with a chorle / and as she wente homeward from her pastu¦re / the wolf came to her and sayde. Nowe shall I fyl my bely of the / for thou mayst not escape. This Damula knelyd downe before the wolf and sayde. I praye the for the loue of Godde to suffir me to go to the folde / for my kydde sou¦kyd not this daye. Wherfore he maye perissh with hon¦gre. And truly I promyse vnto the whan I haue fedde him I shal retourne to the agayn. The wolf thought surely to haue them both saynge. Go to thi folde and bringe thi kydde with the / For I desire greately to se him / and I shall be Fauowrable to yowe both / but withowte the / he shall haue no grace. This Female gote sware to fulfill all this / and forth she wente. But whan she came home she kepte her hows and brought
vppe her kydde and neuer retournyd to the wolf. wher¦fore the wolf made greate lamentacyon many a longe daye aftir and sayde. He that is possessyd and hath golde in honde. Is not wise to lese it for promys tresour or londe. So manyon hauing sufficience / for concupiscens & auarice desire to swalow vp al thinges like wol¦fis insaciable / that neuer be saturate. wherfore they be voyde oftyntymes and not alwaye fully replete. a coue¦tows man full of auarice is lyke a vessell botomelesse / that is neuer fall / as it is wrytten Eccle. quinto. The Couetows man shall neuer be fyllyd with money / and therfore olde princis hatyd couetyse and forsoke it. And they desirid not to haue dominacyon to gadre money / but for worshippe and conseruacyon of the comune we∣le. wherfore Valery tellyth. lib .iii. whan Scypion was accusyd of couetyse to the Senate he answerde and say¦de in this maner. whan I lately had subduyd all Affri¦ke vnto yowr power. I reseruyd therof nothinge to my behofe / sauf oonly my name. For he was namyd euyr aftir Scipio Affrican. for he subduyd affrike. Valery al¦so tellith of man tense curione that was the verye lore∣mastir of curtesye of rome and a spectacle of strength / whan the legatis of the Sannytes were come to hym and he had receyuyd them in to his place / they behylde hym sittynge by the fire vppon a stole etynge his sow∣pere in a platere of tre. They offirde to him a gret sum¦me of Golde and with swete woordes they prayde him to occupie the Golde to his worshippe and to ete nomo∣re in tre. And he lawghid and sayde. your labowre is in vayne to bringe Golde to me. But goo ye and repoor∣te vnto the Sannytes that the Mantense Curione de¦sireth rather to rule them that hath possessyon of golde
than to haue the golde. and also saye vnto them that the sayde Curione wyll notte be corrupte by no money / nor by drede of any enymyes. Also it is tolde in that sa∣me place that whan the legatis sent from the sannytes were come to Rome / the founde fabrice prince of the Ro¦maynes sittinge and syngynge. To whom whan they had offirde a greate Summe of Golde for ther lyberty He beholdinge not his owne wele / but rather the comu¦ne profit / gaue this answer to them and sayde. Goo ye fro me and bere yowr Golde with yowe. For Romay¦nes haue more affeccyon to haue dominacion ouir gold¦kepers then ouer the Golde. And also saynt Augustin tellyth de ciuitate Dei that Lucyus Valerius that dy∣de whan he was consull of Rome / was so poore that no money was founde in his hows whan he shulde dye. wherfore he desyred the people to ordeyne for his beryin¦ge. For in that tyme the princes that rulyd the comune thinge / that was mooste ryche. In ther owne howsis they were very pouer. wherfore saint Augustyne saith in the same place / that oon of them was twyes consull and he was vtterly expulsyd of the Senate / for cawse that .x. powndis of money were fownde in his hows. And Valery saith. Euery man labowrid to encrece the comyn wele / and not his owne / and desired rather to be pouer in a riche reame / than to be riche in a pouer reame And he inducith examplys of the consullys that were soo pouer whan they dyed that they had no goodes to preferre theyr doughtirs / to mariages. but notwithstō¦dinge the necessite of worthymen was releuyd by the se¦nate. And they vsyd customablye to preferre the dough¦tyrs of them to worshipfull mariages. and saint augu∣styn Epistola quinta. That thei that wisely aduertith and attendith say that it was more to be sorowyd whā
the wylfull pouertye of Rome was forsakyn. Than whan richesse lackyd. For in pouertye the integrite of all goode maners was conseruyd. Richesse corruptyth the mynde of man / worse than any other enymye. wherof it is red that the hoste of alexander was enry∣chid owte of nombir whan Darye was deuicte / & bre∣uely aftir / whan they shulde fight agayne / thei of ale∣xandirs hoste were ouercome. which whan alexandir vnderstode he commaundyd immediatly al tho goodes to be brente that his hooste had gotyn by spolyacyon & sayde. As longe as my people had no possession of goo∣des ther was noon that myght resiste them. But now that they be oerate and chargyd with gold and syluer they be made slowghtfull and vnlusty / and whan tho goodes were brent and goone / they fawghte and were manlye as they were before. Also it is redde of the Ro¦maynes that in olde tymes they warryd to gete wor∣shippe. To haue lybertye / for conseruacyon of the co∣myn wele / and than they obtaynyd and had the bet∣tyr at all tymes / But whan ther myndes were infecte with couetyse and auarice / then were they continually victe and ouercome. ¶ Of a lytell discolowrid beaste callyd Varius and the swyrell. Dialogo .cx. VArius is a lytell beaste some what mo¦re then a wesyll and he is callyd Vari∣us for he is variably colowrid. For on the bely he is whyte and on the backe he hath a colowre lyke asshis. so com∣ly that thowe mayste meruayle to see so fourmably he is depayntyd with colowrys / and he
is of the kynde of piroly / and he bydith moche in treys and bringeth forth his generacyon. And dyuers men vse greatly to reioyce in dyuers garnamentis furryd with skynnes of these beastis. But neuerthelesse thys prety beaste reioycith but lytellin his owne furre / & all thoughe yt this Varius be but lytell of bodelye quanti¦te. yit aftir the consideracion of his noble furre / he is a most excellent beste. & so is ye sayrell also. These tway¦ne were associate togider & sayde. we twayne be honou¦rable & of grete price amonge all people for the gret va¦lowre of owr skynnes. And forasmoche as we be so No∣ble of owr natyf kynde / let vs pursewe such beastis as be vyle & despisable. wherfor it fortunyd yt they founde a Tode crepinge / & they greuid him sore / & put him to grete vexacyon. To whom the tode spake & sayde. god made vs all & not we owre selfe. If ye be more bewti∣full thāke ye yowr muker. These beestis were wroth
with the toode / and put owte both his Ien saynge. Da¦ryst thow speke agayne vs thou vglye creature. and aftirwarde they fownde an owle makynge her neste in a tre. and they made greate showte and noyse aftir her and put her to flyghte and destroyde both her neste and her eggis. The owle fledde with greate heuynesse and sayde. bredren ye haue done euyll to me. For I am a cre¦ature of Goddis creacyon as ye be. but thowgh I can∣not be auengid my self. an other shall be vengid vppon yowe / For yowr extorcyon. at the last they Fownde an Ape Iapinge and mowynge vppon a tre. To whome they sayde. why art not thow shamefaste thow worst of all beastis / For thou hast no tayle / and thow shewi∣ste vs thyn arse. The ape was woode and cam downe From the tree / and kyllyd them both / and pluckyd owte ther Guttes and sayde / in this maner as here fo∣lowyth. Noble people naturallye be curteys / and goode Mockers and skorners be farre fro gentyl bloode THerfore noble people and myghty shulde notte greue them that be pouer and lowe. For nobi∣lyte restith not in the dignite of the parentys. But rather in the composicion of goode maners / as the Philosofir saith. Noblesse is that thinge oonlye that garnysshith the sowle with good maners / and alsoo yt is Communely sayde. He is a vyllayne that doth vyl¦lanows thinges / and not he that was borne in vylla. It is redde that a Lyon dyd greate hurte in his yowth for he hadde wowndyd sore withe his cleys a Boore / a bull / and an asse. and in processe he was olde / and in ye wynter season he fell in to a greate snow / and he was so colde that he cowde not ryse by him self. That seyn¦ge yt boore and remembringe of his olde wowndys / he
smote him greuously with his teth. and the bull / alsoo gooryd him in to the bely with his hornys. The Asse with his helis layd at him frely and hit him on the fo¦rehede with many a greate stroke. The Lyon myghte not flye but spake with grete dolowre / and sayde. All thinge that I haue ouercome / ouercomith me nowe. My worshippe is nowe a slepe / and helpe of myne ho¦nowre is paste. Beholde nowe he noyeth me that I ha¦ue noyede / and as I haue done to other before tyme no∣we fallyth it to me. ¶ Of the Horse and the boore Dialogo .cxi.
ON a tyme it befell that an hors had ple¦ded so longe a geynste a Boore that by longe contynuance the horse becam so poer that he was nat able to mateyne his plee for lacke of money or goodes / for all his substance was spent & gone & he sought his frendis / Than he went to the Mule & prayed hym with great lamentacyon to lend hym .x. li .in golde / the whiche he dyd for pitye with a good wyll. wherwith the horse wan his plee & recouered all his co∣stys and damages / with habundance of great goodes. Thus whan all his care was past and he beinge ageyn in his prosperyte / the Mule come vnto hym & required his lendt money / the whiche with a mockynge maner The horse that was inflamyd with ire and falshede / callyd to him the camell and the asse / and they thre all to bete the mule and went forth to the iuge. The iuge this knowinge he gaue this sentence that all that mo∣ney shulde breuely be restoryd to the mule / and for ther violence / and hurtys that they had done to him / they shulde paye him an hundryd markys. The camell ha∣uynge no goode to paye / he forsoke the cyte and was ba¦nyshed. The asse was imprisonyd & stockyd faste & en∣dyd his lyfe wretchidlye. The horse was constraynyd by greate rygowre to paye his dettys and his damage and so he remaynyd in greate pouertye / and was vtter¦ly vndone and spoylyd and sayde. He that is indettyd and wyll neuer paye Shal lese oftyn tymes / and his goode shall awaye. SO ther be manyon yt be vnkynde yt knowe not benefitys done to them / nor yelde no thankyn∣g is to ther goode doers. Agayn such caton saith
be thou remembryd of ye benefitis yt thou hast receyuid. And also he saith. A lytell gyfte yt thi pouer frende ge∣uith vnto the. Receyue thou gladlye / & remembyr fully to gyue thankinges. But many oon now a dayes / not oonly gyue no thankynges / but rather speke falsely a∣gayne ther goode doers. As it is red yt whan a sertayne kynge had exaltyd oon that he especyally louyd aboue al other. This man thought & sayde to him self. The kynge hath so gretely auancyd me yt I shal neuer aqui¦te him nor be free. Wherfor he compassyd ye kynges deth The kynge yt knowinge cyted him before his own pre∣sence / and the trouth knowen / he iugid him to be dra∣wyn throwe ye ite. And as he was drawyn / euery man threwe vnclene thing is vpon him. and he suffirde it pa¦ciently forasmoche as he in prosperite had be combrous and not fauowreable to any persone / but prowde & noy∣able to all people. But whan a frende of his which he louyd as him self had throwyn a stoone at him & smyt∣te him on the too / he cryed out & made grete heuynesse / & whan he had be drawyn & was brought befor ye kyng gayn. The kynge askyd of his seruauntis / How beha∣nyd ye wretche him self in his passyon. They sayde / ve∣ray pacyently. But he made grete lamentacyon for oon stroke ye was geuyn him. The kynge inquyred of him ye cawse. And sayde. For I louyd him most feruentlye yt smote me / & trustyd synglerly to his socowr. The kyn¦ge sayde. Of thyn owne mowth I iuge yt thou bad ser∣uante. For thou hast most falsely withoute cawse con∣spired agayne me. And ye kynge commaundyd that he shulde be hangyd forthwith / accordynge to his deme∣rytes. Hitte is a greate maruayle that creaturis hauin¦ge reason shalde be so Ingrate / and vnkynde whan brute Beastis vnresonable knowe ther benefactours
As it is redde that vppon a tyme whan a Lyon was ta¦kyn in the nettis of hunters a shepeheerde that was compassionable vnto hym delyuerid him. And an other tyme the same lyon was agayne takyn of hunters / & put in to a caue of the Emperowrys wyth other wyl∣de beastis. And the forsayde shepeheerde for hys offen¦cys was caste in to the same caue to be deuowryd. And the Lyon knowinge the Shepeheerde not oonely hurte hym not / but also preseruyd hym from al other beastis that wolde haue deuowryd hym. Alsoo it is redde that the duke of Saxonye fownde a Lyon fightynge withe a moost cruell Serpente / whiche hadde compassyd the necke of hym rownde abowte. and intendyd with hys venyme to sle hym. The knyghte beholdinge the no∣blesse Leonyne / and the malyce Serpentine / He smote of the Serpentis hede. Wherfore the Lyon folowyd ye knyghte lyke a tame beaste / and neuer forsoke hym. and for the forsayde knyghtes loue / the forsayde Lyon fawghte agayne hys enymyes / and whan the knight was dede and buryed. The Lyon / for loue laye on his graue / and there dyed. ¶ Of the asse and the Oxe. Dialogo .cxii. AN Oxe and an asse had ther dwellyn¦ge togider / withe an husbondeman / whiche fedde them plentyfully. But many tymes he prickyd them and cō¦pellyd them to labowre. Vppon a ty∣me this man bete his asse / and he was angrye and went to the Oxe saynge What shal we doo. This Chorle betith vs sore / and
makith vs werye. Let vs goo from hym / and caste vp owr yockys / for we be but yonge as yit / and we maye be mery a greate whyle and owte of daungere. and soo forth they went. and as they walkyd by many fayre pasturis they were veray gladde. and at laste nyghte came and it was veray Darke / and they compleynyd euerich to other and sayde. How shall we slepe. Oxe hows haue we noon as we were wonde to haue. Cer∣taynlye it had bene bettyr for vs to maynteyne trewe labowre then to departe. and as they laye on the gron∣de couetinge to slepe. The wolf came cryinge and ve∣xyd them so sore / that all the longe nyghte they were withowte slepe and sayde. It is not goode for vs to by∣de here / but rather with smale beastys / for then shall we be defendyd of shepeheerdys and doggis. and whan they came to the Flockes / desyringe to be with them / and tarye all nyghte. The shepeheerdys expulsydde them / and bete them / and they weppyd and made gre∣temone
& concordyd to dwel with a laborer that punys¦shed them soore & fed them scantly. Wherfor they were compuncte gretly / & retournyd to ther first state & sayd Bettir it is in suretye at home for to byde Thē through ye world to wādyr & be without guyde IN this we may note what iubardye it is to goo in to straunge contreys and fro place to place / & to be lodgyd in othermennys howsis / wherof it is sayd Eccle .xxix. It is a wycked lyfe to be logid from bous to hous. & it is also bettir & more profitable to suf¦fir otherwhile some small greef / then to suffir a gretter greef. and whan a man shal doo any thinge euyr he o∣with wysely to consider what may fall to him therbye as the wiseman saith. What soeuyr thow doo / do it wi¦sely and beholde the ende. And also he saith / I wyl paci¦enely suffir smale hurtys in eschewing of gretter. wher¦of it is tolde that a kyte on a tyme greuyd dowuis very fore & stale awaye ther chekyns / and otherwhyle the dowuys defendyd them self to ther power / and smote him with ther wynges & draue him away. At last they mde a counsell & chose the goshawke to be ther kynge to mayntayne them agayn the furyous kyte. The kin¦ge began cruellye and was to them more noyable then ther olde enymye / and toke dayly oon of the fatteste / & ete her. The dowuys complaynyd emonge them self of ther kynge and sayde that bettyr it had bene to them & lesse hurte to haue suffirde the batell of the kyte / then to be mourdryd dayly and cruelly slayne withowte de∣fence or remedye. By this it is shewyd that bettyr coun¦sell is bettyr with reste and sykernesse than delectable with besynes and parell. As Isope shewith in fablys yt the feelde mows came to the towne / and there he was worthyly receyuyd of the mows of the cite / and he ma∣de
hym greate chere / and commendyd the large expen∣se of the cyte greatelye / and browght him to the byssho¦pis celar / and gaue him delycate mete. at laste came ye botelar / and the kaye ratled / and in came he. The how¦se mowse fledde in to his hoole. The feld mows ranne agayne the wallys and scantlye escapyd with his lyfe At laste they mette togider and the felde mows sayde. I had leuer gnawe harde benys all my lyfe then to be in this sodeyne feere. Take to the thy delycatys / that be to the greate pleasure / for I loue pece with pouertye and quietnesse delyteth me more then precyosite of me∣tys / or delycyows fedynges.
Of the Goote and the Ram. Dialogo .cxiii. DIuers beastis in a grete Flocke were gadryd togider vppon a tyme / and fed them in ther pasturis. The Ram a∣monge all other callyd the Goote fro the Flocke and sayde. Go we fro the Flocke. To what entent abyde we with these shepe so shamefullye. and whan they were departyd from the Flocke and had forsake the feleship¦pe. The rauenows wolf that lurkyd in the woodes ca¦me owte vppon them and bote them / and fedde hym self / and sayde. Bettyr it is with compeny surely to goo. Then to be soole / for drede of thy foo. By this example it aperith that he that forsakith goode compeny forsakyth greate suretye. For it is wrytten Eccle .iiii. wo be to the sole man for if he fall he hath no helpar to ryse.

Dialogo .cxiiii.
PAnterais a beaste of dynerse colowris very fayre and swete smellynge / So∣lyne saith that it is a beaste very es∣pecyall varyed with colowris / full of smale cerclys / soo that he shynyth of the yelowe cerclys that be hyd / and his colowryd boody is distincte in yelowe and whyte. And it is in his manere a meke beaste / and he hath the dragon oonly to his enymye. And whan he hath etyn / and is sufficiently replete with dyuerse metys / he hy∣deth him self and slepith in his caue / as saith Phisiolo¦gus. And aftyr thre dayes he ryseth from sleape / and makyth greate noyse all other beastis whan they here the voyce of him they gadir togider / and folowe the swetnesse of the sauowr that comyth owt of his mouth The dragon allonlye whan he herith the voyce of him is full of drede / and hydith him self in his caue. Vppon a tyme this Pantera was gretely temptyd to ete of an
of an hogge. But forasmoche as he was acustomyd to ete clene mete. He abhorryd yt was vnclene. Notwith∣stondinge he nourrisshed an hogge for him self and or∣deynyd for him a moost clene lodginge / and cawsid him oftyn to be wypedde / and wolde notte suffir him to be wrappyd in the myre. This vnclene sowe was wroth and had a naturall apetyte rather to be rollyd in yt my∣re / then to be kepte clene. And at a leysar this sowe sta¦le owte of the hows / and all to defylyd her self with o∣ther swyne of her owne kynde. Wherfore the forsayde swete beste Pantera hatyd the hogge / and putte her a¦way from him for euer and sayde. From nature and kynde any thinge to chaunge It is veray paynfull / and oftyntymes straunge THus doo vnclene people and synful which may not aryse out of the myre of concupiscens / and lecherye / for theyr bad custome / for the philoso∣fre saith. Custome is an otherkynde / and therfor with stonde in the begynnynge. Temptacyon in his springin¦ge is lyke a yonge plante / that esyly maye be pluckyd vp or euer he growe to a tre by age / but as ye glose saith Customhably synne is lyke to an olde sykenesse / which is harde to be helyd. Wherof it is wrytten Ihero .xiii. If ethiops may chaunge his skynne / and a parde hys varyacyon of colowre. Then may ye doo wele aftyr yor continuall synne. As who saith / it is lyke an impossibi¦lite. It is redde of vespayane the Emperowre / yt whan he was couetows and had so contynuyd vnto age / and a sertayn persone had repreuyd him and sayde. A foxe maye chaunge his skynne / but not his condycions / he answerde and sayde. At suche men we may smyle / and take it to owr owne correccyon. ¶ Of the wylde Asse and the wylde boore. dia .cxv
AS Papye wryteth Onager is a wyl¦de Asse / and aper is a bore or a wyld hogge. These two beastis fonde ther mastir walkynge in the fylde / & thei sayde vnto him. Helpe vs mastir we praye the / and gyue rightfull iuge∣ment of vs. To whom he sayde. What shall I doo to yowe. The asse answerde. My lorde hath deceyuyd me / for he hath a lytell whelpe yt ecyth of his mete / and slepith on his owne bedde / & my lorde cherysshith him and playth with him dayly / and he neuyr towchyth me. Nor shewith to me suche mery contenance / ye dayly bere his sackys and vexe my self in his labowr. to whō his mastir sayd. thou asse yf thy de¦sire be to be oftyn sene / & touchid / thow muste be clene & not defylyd. The lytell whelpe is acceptable & plesant to his lorde / for he is continually clene & waytyth vpō him. ye bore also sayde. My lorde kepith a nyghtingale
at whome in a goldyn cage. And whan she syngeth / he reioycyth gretly / and is veray myrye. And whan I drawe forth my songe / it is nothinge to his pleasure / nor whan my felowe syngith nether. Wherfor we pray the ordyr this matere in dewe fourme. To these pety∣cions ther mastir answerde and sayde. ye knowe notte what ye shulde aske. If ye desire to be harde and takyn hede to. ye muste haue delectable and swete songis. and voyce timable / and not contrarye. The nyghtyngale is iowyouslye harkenyd / for she spekyth and singethe plesauntlye / and so do not yowe. and they were confu∣syd with these wordes / and sayde. That is not lefull we shulde neuyr axe Nor in vnknowyn connynge owr tongis laxe. THerfore yf we desire gladlye to be sene and tow¦chid / let vs stody to be clene & not defilyd. & mo¦reouyr yf we wyll be harde and attendyd to. Speke we plesauntly and vertuouslye. Not vyle woordes of ry∣baw drye and of corrupcyon. Some personys ther be of whom the throte is lyke a graue that stynkyth whan it is openyd / as it is wrytten psalmo .v. a graue alopyn is the throte of them. That is to saye. Of synfull men that euer speke stinkynge woordes. Of whom also it is wrytten in that same booke. God mote destroye al wyc¦ked lyppes and tonges large spekynge. That is to me∣ane agayne God and his neybowre. They that speke suche woordes of contumely and iniurye owe not to be harde as Seneca saith. The erys shulde be stoppid a∣gayne bad talys. Diogenes the philosofir sayde to a ser¦tayne persone that tolde hym a bad tale that his fren∣de shulde saye by him / it is to me dowtfull whethir my frende so sayde. But it is veray sertayne to me yt thow sayste shrewdlye of me. Antisthenes answerde to oon
that reportyd that an other shulde saye shrewdlye by him / he sayde not so of me / but of him that knowith him self to haue suche fawtys within him. Senocrates an∣swerde to oon yt cursyd him. as thow art lorde of thi ton¦ge so am I lorde of myn erys / for I maye close them at my pleasure. he gaue alsoo an answer to an othir that tolde him that a sertayne persone cursyd hym / and re∣portyd falsely of him. I care not. For herynge shulde be strenger than the tonge. For to euery creature longith but oon tonge and two rys. and so a man shulde suffir more with his tway erys / than any man myght speke with oo tonge. It is olde in a boke of Iapes of philoso¦firs that oon answerde to an other that sayde shrewde∣ly to him. Thow mayste esylye saye to me euyll / for I wyl not answer. In the same boke hit is tolde that the Philosofre zeno / sayde to oone that cursyd him. If thou hardist thy self with myne erys thow shuldyste be styl and noote well that there was greate pacyence in olde fadirs in suffringe of contumelyows woordes and re∣bukes. It is redde of alexander / as it aperyth in the .iii. boke of Iapis of philosofir that antigonus sayde vnto him / it is conuenient to thyn age to rule / as who saith. Thow arte vnworthy to regne / but by the reason of thyn age and voluptuousnes / and neuerthelesse he suf¦firde it moost pacyentlye / In that same boke alsoo it is tolde of the pacyence of Iulii Cesaris which greately lothid to be ballyd / how be it / he was soo. and whan he kembyd his here forewarde / that grewe bacwarde / a knygte sayde vnto him. O Emperowre it is more possi¦ble to me to preuayle agayne the hoost of Rome / than the to be not ballyd / which sayinge he paciently suffir∣de / and also whan there were made of him famows bo¦kes and rydyculows songes opynlye songe / and that to
his rebuke he suffirde it pacyently. And also vppon a ty¦me whan an agid woman despised his oryginal / and be gynnynge / and callyd hym bredemaker / and baker he suffryd it / and smylyd at her. In the same place it is tol¦de of Cesar Augusto / that whan oon spake to him and sayde. O thow tyrawnte. He answerde. If I were soo / thow woldist not so call me. In that same place also it is tolde of Scipione affrican / that whan oon callid him from fightinge and rebukyd hym he sayde. My modir brought me forth an Emperowre and not a warryowr It is tedde also of Cesar augusto in the thrid boke of ia¦pis of philosofirs. That whan Tyberius complaynid to him that many spake euyll of him / he answerde. It is sufficyent to vs / if we haue that fortune that no per¦son can preuayle to do vs hurte. Therfore be thow not greuyd yf any person speke shrewdly of vs / for we may suffir it. And Seneca tellyth of the pacyence of Antigo¦ni in his thrid boke deira. That whan he had harde dy¦uerse personys spekynge euyll of him to ther thinkyng the kynge not knowinge / and he had harkenyd & playn¦ly harde euery woorde / for as moche as betwene hym and them was interiecte but a thyn wall / he softelye / knockyd with his honde and sayde as thoughe he had bene an othir person. Goo ye yowr waye hens that the kynge here yowe not. Also Seneca tellyth in his .iiii. bo¦ke deira of the sayde kynge antigono. That vppon a tyme whan he harde dyuerse of his knyghtes / saynge by him all the euyll they cowde / he went to them yt had spokyn moost & sayde. Now that ye haue cursyd yowre kynge cawselesse and spokyn of him soo vncurteyslye. now leue youreuyl speche / & wil him good / for he louith you neuerthelesse. O meruelous humilite of a kynge / yt disdaynyd not to condescende to them yt labowrid moost
and a wondirfull pacience that he was not indignate / nor cruell to gyue iugement to them that cursyd hym / and deseruid it. ¶ Of the Salamandre and the Idre. Dialogo .cxvi. THe Salamandre is of the kynde of a lacerte or of a stellyon a pestiferus beaste and most gret¦ly venymed. For as plinius saith lib .xxix .ca .iiii. she infectith the frutes of treys and corrup¦tith the watirs. Of the which who so euyr e∣tyth or drinketh / he is euen strayt dede. And also yf ye spetyll of her towche the fote of a man. It is poysoned and destroieth him. and all be it so that in the Salamā¦dre remaynyth greate strengthe of poyson / she ys¦etyn of some Beastys / and takyn for a foode. This sayde beaste Salamandre oonly and no mo lyuyth in ye
fire / as saith Plinius / and putteth owte both the fire / and the flame / & it is the kynde of a Salamandre to be rowgh & full of curlyd herys / lyke a see calf. Of whose skynne somtyme is made gyrdyllys for kynges to we∣re. For whā they haue be longe worne / & then caste in to the fire they wyl not burne / but aftir they haue lye longe in the fyre they be clene & newly pourgid & be new¦lye drawyn from the fire as though they were repay∣rid of newe. & of the same skynne be made macchis yn lampes yt wyll not waste for no brinnynge. Hydrus is a poysonde Serpent that leuith in the watyrs hauing .v¦heedis. The twey serpentis fawght togider / but whan the Salamandre was ouercome of the Hydre / she lepte in to the fire to escape. Whan the hydre had the worse / and was almooste scomfighte of the Salamandre he fledde in to the watirs. And so they conseruyd them self from deth and sayde. He that retournyth to his owne naturall place Shal be defendyd / and fynde greate solace. THus owe we to diffende owre self / whan we be temptyd of owr goostly enymyes. Of the bryn∣nynge fire of concupiscens and lechery. We shul¦de manlye resiste and caste owr self in to the watirs of Chastite and clennesse. Whan we be impugnyd of the watirs of couetyse and auaryce. We owe to lepe in to ye fire of charite and largesse / by example of the downe. For it is redde in the propirte of byrdes that there be so∣me Goshawkys that take no byrdes / but oonly in the eyre / And some ther be that take noon but oonly in the londe. And naturally the downe knowith that. & ther¦fore she flyeth / fro the Goshawke that cachith her in
the ayre / and descendith in to the londe / If she be purse¦wyd of the hawke that rauyssheth on the londe / she cō¦tinuith and bydith styll in the ayre. Suche reason shul¦de we haue agayne the Goshawke of hell / which hath a M. wyles to hurte / wherof Paulyne saith. Our ene¦my to whom is knowen a M. dyuerse wayes of noyin¦ge / shulde be defendyd with soo many diuerse wepyns as he ordeynyth sotylteys. And therfore whan myn e∣nymye pursewith me / hauinge so many disceytes. I mu¦ste by Goddys grace ordeyne a M. dyuerse wayes to with stonde him. It is told yt a demoniak was brought to an holy man / which commawndyd the feende to co∣me forth and tell hym his name / and he answerde and sayde. We be thre fendes / that dwell in this man / I am callyd the closer of the harte / My secounde brodyr is callyd the closer of the mowth / and the thrid is callyd closer of the purse / Myn office is to indurate the harte of the synner that he may haue no contricyon / and if he be contrite / my brodyr labowrith to kepe him from con¦fession. And though he be confessyd / my thrid brodir wil suffre him do no satisfaccyon / And thus my thrid bro∣dir is namyd / closer of the purse. And by these meanys we preuayle agayne moche people ¶ Of the Ape / and a beaste callyd Taxus. and in Englyssh a Brocke. Dialogo. Cxvii.
OF Taxus the here is harshe & rough and is a beaste to the quantite of a fox Of this beaste spekith plinius. li .viii .cap .xxxix. and saith / whan doggis fo¦lowe him / he restraynyth and kepith in his winde and his breth / and soo he cawsith his skynne to be blowyn and straynyd / and be that meane he defendyth the bytynge of doggis / and fe¦lyth not the strokes of men. This beast hatith the foxe and hath a custome to fighte agayne him. But the sub¦tyll foxe seynge that he cowde not hurte this brocke for his harde skynne / and rowgh here / she faynyd her self to be venquyssyd and victe / and of subtylte fledde and ran a waye. and while this Taxus this brocke or gray sawghte for his praye. The false foxe entryd in to hys closette / and shamefully defylyd the lodgynge of this graye with pysse and other vnclene thinges. In some∣che that he abhorryd to come home / and vtterly forso∣ke
his howsolde / and chose him an other lytell mansyō for his ease a greate waye thens. If he lacke mete in ye wintyr / he wyll sleape for his dyner / for it is a beaste yt leuith moche by sleape .vnto this brocke came an ape and sayde. Brodir lende me an .c. markys. For I haue affeccyon to goo beyonde the see to marchandise / and I shall trulye deuyde the lucre betwene the and me. To whom the brocke answerde. That shall I gladly grā¦te the. For all my desire is to lyue easyly. wherfor thou shalt haue thy desire yf thou canste fynde me sufficient suretye and make me an instrumente by the hondes of a notarye. The ape founde sureteys the bugle and the bull / and lefte the oblygacyon / in kepinge of the horse / and went forth on his iourney / and neuir came home agayne. Taxus this brocke seynge that he was thus illudyd of the ape. he askyd his goode of the sureteys. They scornyd him and despised him gretely. Wherfore this beaste complaynyd to the iuge / and shewyd hym his obligacion. The iuge immediatly cyted the credi∣towris and gaue sentence that they shulde restore the goodes accordinge to ther bonde. Wherfore they were greatly wroth and euer malygnyd agayne the brocke and pursewyd him. And at the laste they toke him and wowndyd him sore with many a greate stroke / & whan he was so woundyd he sayde with greate lamentacion and mourninge. He that can beware of him that wolde borowe Is euyr owte of stryfe and kepte fro moche sorowe
OFtyntymes it happith that a man lesith his frē¦des whan he askyth his owne goodes that he hath lente. Neuerthelesse the Prophete saith. Psalmo .cxi. He is a iocounde man that she with mer∣cye and lendith. But that notwithstondinge Caton saith. Loke to whom thow geuyste. That is to meane / ther shulde be a discrecyon in the gyuer and lendar / it is tolde in fablys that a doo beynge greate with fawne ca¦me to an othir doo that had an hows / and withe swete woordes. Fayre prayers and lamentacion she askyd lod¦gynge / and desyred hows rome for the tyme of her nede permyttynge / that she shulde delyuer the hows to the ownar whan she had fawnyd. The other was mercy∣full and departyd / and suffirde her to haue the rome. And aftir a longe season whan the iubardy was paste The ownar retowrnyd and repetyd his right. The o∣ther lockyd faste the durrys / and closyd her erys / and wolde not delyuer that she promysyd. But spake cruel∣lye and sayde. I fere not thi longe teth. For the teth of my children shal al to rent ye. Wherfor by this fable a man is tawghte that he shulde not alwaye gyu credē¦ce to hastyly to swete woordes. For manyon be discey∣uyd by the meanys of pyte. As Isope tellyth wyllynge to shewe that nothinge maye profite vnto bad folke whan the shrewyd mynde of them is notte a shamyd to be vnremembryd of a good dede. Wherfore he tellyth that the wolf was acloyed in the throte / and almoste chokyd with a boone of a lambe that he had deuowryd which stacke faste in his throte ouirthwarte. Wherfo∣re in all possible haste he sent to the crane that he with his longe byll shulde drawe it owt. The bone owt dra∣wyn fro the throte of the wolf by the meanys of the cra¦ne / he askyd his rewarde which the wolf had promysed
hym. The wolf answerde and sayde. Thou vnhappy creature / lyuest not thow by the gyft of me / myght not I with oon bytte haue bytte a sonder thy necke. Ther∣fore take thi lyfe / for my rewarde. For other rewarde shalt thow noon haue of me. And so manyon be vnkyn¦de to ther benefactowris. ¶ Of the mows / and the catte Dialogo .cxviii. VPpon a tyme the mows went vnto ye catte and humbly salutyd him & sayde O mastir of mooste excellence I enten¦de euer to do to the trewe seruice. alon¦lye I beseche the by my protectowre a∣gayne the wodenesse of the wesyll. the
Catte receyuyd him in to proteccyon and led the mous aboute with him and wolde not suffir him to be desey∣uyd of the wesyll. The wesyl was greuyd with the de¦alynge of the catte and enuyed at him greatlye. Vppon a tyme the mows offendyd and the Catte dyd dew cor¦reccyon. Wherwith the mows was greuyd and went to the wesyll and sayde whan he had done dewe salu∣tacyon. Myne offencys be grete and I am veryly wor¦thy to be punyshed. For I haue bene agayne the vnder proteccyon of the catte. And thus subtelly he sowid dis¦corde betwene the catte and the wesyll / whan he was iustely punyshed of eyther of them. At last he browght them to that pointe that vtterly they intendyd eche to kyll other. and as they were goynge promptely to batel the wesyll spake and sayde. O dere suster what meane we. Why shulde oon of vs sle the other by the meanys of the false mows. Bettir it is and lesse hurte for vs to kyll him / than to kyll owrself. These wordes plesyd well the catte / and they both togider kylled the mows and ete him meryly betwene them and sayde They that make Rancowre / discorde or debate Shal not be vnpunyshed erly or late. THus do flaterers and malycyows people betwe¦ne princes and lordes that be at reste and peace Wherfore they be hatefull vnto god / for hit is wrytten Prouer .vi. Ther be .vi. thinges that God ha¦tyth / and ye .vii .is detestable vnto him. Ien highe lokin¦ge / a tonge lyinge / hondes shedynge innocente bloode. The harte thinkynge moost wycked thowghtys.

A flaterer and a dowble tongid man is acursyd / for he hath trowblyd many a man / that dwel¦lyd in peace. Olde fadirs louid no suche glosers & dow∣ble tongyd folkys / for in them was magnificence and strength for to saye the trowth / in all ther spechis / as Valery tellyth libro sexto. That whan all the people hopyd vppon the deth of the tyraunte Dyonyse / for ye excedinge bytternesse of his moost cruell maners / a wo¦man of the grettest age prayde the goddis yt he mighte continewe longe in lyfe without sykenes or disease / & whan the sayde Tyrawnte knewe it / he maruaylyd o herbenyuolence withowt his deseruinge / and Callyd her / and inqueryd what rewarde she had receyuyd of him so to saye. She answerde and sayde. For a reason that I haue prouyd by experience before tyme. For whā I was a mayde and had a greuous tyraunte. I wolde gladlye haue lackyd him. and whan he was slayne / a worse occupied his rome / and then his dominacyon to be endyd I desired moost feruently. & a worse rular than thou art we kepe neuer to haue. therfor I drede if thow were take frō vs. a worse yf it be possible shulde succede in to thy place. Therfore I haue prayde for thi conserua¦cyon. Olde philosophirs also had leuyr dye for saynge trowthe / then to lyue and hyde it. wherfore of Dyoge∣ne it is tolde / that he was shewynge trowthe in euery place. Of whom Valery spekith li .iiii .ca .iii. that whan aristipus had sayde to the forsayde Diogene yt stoode & wasshyd wortys. O Dyogene if thou haddiste pleasyd yt tyrāte dyonyse with thi fayre woordes / thou shuldist not haue nedyd th{us} to do / truly quod he yf thou woldist
do thus / thou shuldist not haue nede to flater ye sayd ty¦raunte. For this philosofre had moche leuyr to be fedde and maynteynyd with a messe of wortys & say trouth then to be fed with ye kynges deyntis and to flater him or say to him other then trowth. ¶ Of .v. Lambys and a Wolf. Dialogo .cxix. FIue Lambys ther were in nombyr yt were forsakyn both of fader and moder and lefte lyke pupyllis and orphanys / were rulyd / and gydyd of ther kynsmen and tutowris / vp¦pon a tyme the wolf callyd oon of these lambys secretly to him / and sayde. I thinke to be compassiona∣ble vnto the. Consyderinge thy greate frende and
fadir is dede. Wherfor I wyll delyuer to the my lettirs of proteccyon that thow mayst goo sawf. Neuertheles¦se first goo to thi bredren and bydde them come to me with the to conferme this matere. This innocente lam was reioycid with grete gladnesse & went to his bredrē and shewyd vnto them all this mater. To whom thei sayde. This plesith vs greatly. But go we first to our frendes and tutowris and desire ther counsell. & whan they came to them. Ther tutowris answerde & sayde Beware for god sake of suche a mastir. For and yf ye go and return to him / he wil destroye yow and kyll you But they not takinge hede of the holsome consel of ther senyours / went forth to the wolf. The cruel wolf syn¦ge them was very glad / and lepte amonge them & kyl¦led them euery chone and fedde him self and his childrē and sayde. He walkyth euyl and oftyn offendith. That to sadde counsell neuir attendith. THerfore we muste gyue credence to the counsell of our senyours. For it is wrytten. Iob▪ xxv .in agyd folkys is great wysdome and prudence in longe tyme. we shulde do aftir counsell / and especyally of our frendes. For it is sayde prouer .iii. Kepe thow the lawe and good counsell and lyfe shal be geuyn vnto thi sowle and grace vnto thy chekys. It is sayde that an husbondman labowryd his londe and sew it with hem¦pe. Flexe or lynette seede. A Swalowe that was olde and wise / seynge that / callyd all othir byrdes togider & sayde. This feelde and this seede thretnyth vs soore. For in tyme comynge / hereof shal be made many a com¦berows nette. Therfore go we all togider and spurn it a broode / or euir it growe / or come vp. But all othr byr¦des wolde not consente / but repreuyd the swalowe and
sayde she was full of folyssh drede / Vppe grewe this er¦be / and the swalowe warnyd them agayne that greate parell yt approchid and drew nere. The byrdes deryded the swalowe and sayde. This swalowe pleasith men / and flaterith them with his songe. This hempe was full growyn and mowe downe and dyuers nettis were made of it / and cawght many a byrde. Then all the bir¦des knewe ther fawte / and repentyd them whan ther was no remedye. Therfore he that despiseth profitable cownsell / oftyntymes takith vnprofitable / and he that thinkith him self to sure / fallith oftyntymes in to sna∣rys. And many tymes the cownsell of a vyle persone / is very goode aed profitable / for wysdome vaylyth mo¦re then strength. For an example it is wrytten that the Egle fleynge in the eyre and seynge the snayle puttin∣ge owte his hornis. She descendyd and caught her and helde her styll in her cleys. And the snayle shrank in to the shell / so that the Egle in no wyse cowde ete of her. That seynge a crowe sayde vnto the Egle. Thowghe thow be myghty and kynge of all byrdes / thou knowist not all thinge. Harke surely therfore what I saye and doo by my counsell / for that in the shell is very good me¦te and delycyows. Bere the shell vp an highe / and let it fall and breke / and so she dyd / and fownde grete swet¦tenesse. ¶ Of many Crepinge wormys and beastis. Dialogo. CXX. THe Crepynge beastis and wormys vppon the erthe toke ther solace agayne the sonne. But ye moost venymows beaste of all and most pery∣lowse Serpente Basiliscus of whom is made mencyon / in the dialogo .xli. lepte in amonge

The snayle in his cotearmure cam in among all othir / redy to fighte agayne this serpente. And as they fawghte. This Serpente labowryd to byte and to poyson hī. But she wysely drewe in her hede & fete in to the shell / that the serpente cowde not towche her / and aftirwarde whē she espyed auauntage / she put owt her hornys and cleys and pricked this serpent. Wherof she had greate shame. A lytell space aftir / this forsayde ser¦pent basiliscus fortified him self / and thowghte to ex∣cuse him self of yt he had bene shamefully ouircom / and sayde / I wil auenge me. Wherfor yf ther be any amon∣ge all yow yt is so bolde to fighte / I shal make him glad¦ly to turn his backe & fle. The Irchyn full of spinis he∣ringe this / came forthe in his harneys towarde Ba∣tell. And whan this forsayde Serpente sawe him / with greate malyce he came agayne him. This sayd
Irchyn was harty and made sharpe her prickis & smo∣te them in to the serpent / and wowndyd him vnto the effusyon of his bloode. This Basiliscus was faynte for angir and confusyon. Emong all other a frogge be∣holdinge this and thoughte to be auengid vpon the ser¦pente / he lpte vppon him willinge to kyll him. The serpent seynge the frogge all nakyd and bare / without defence / and he him self was both wery and hungrye / & to strength his body he cawght the frogge and swalo∣wyd her in / and sayde. He fightith but faintely / that is not arayde And he that hath noon harneys may euer be afrayde By this we bet awght yt whan we see our greate enymyes somwhat ouerthrowyn / we owe not sodeynlye to fall vpō them / but to refrayne / & to see the ende. For Seneca saith. It is properlye the condi¦cyon of a wyseman to drede his enymye / though he be but weke. And therfore noman shulde reioyce the deth of his enymye / for dowghte of him self. For it is wryttē prouerbi .xxiii. Whan thyn enymye hath had a fall / be thou not glad therof. Nor be thow mery vpon the deth of thyn enymye / leste ther fall lyke iubardye vppon the For he that gretely reioycith vppon the losse or hurte of his enymye / shall fal oftyn in to losse and hurts / It is redde that an Emperowre / had tway seruauntis / of which oon was a taylowre / and the other was a bar∣boure. The taylowre hatyd the barbowre / for cawse the emperour had him more in fauowre. Wherfor he ac¦cusyd him to the Emperour / that he shulde diffame hī and saye that he might not suffir the stench of his breth whan he shauyd him. The Emperowr was sore gre∣uyd and commawndyd him to be caste in to the see in a sacke. And as the sayde Emperour cast forth his honde
poyntynge to the shippemen the place where they shul¦de cast him / his signette of golde fel from his finger in to the see. This barbowre corruptid the shipmen with money / and by them he was conueyed to farre contreys and straunge nacyons. wher as he leuyd prosperowsly And vppon a daye he bought a fissh / and fonde the em∣perowrs ringe in the bely of the same fissh / with the which ringe he came to the Emperowr / and gaue it to him excusynge him self of the cryme that was obiecte agayne him. And at the laste for a rewarde he desyred that the taylowre that had ioyed of his deth / myght be cast in to that same place of iubardye that he was / and so he escapyd. and his enymye was destroyed / that hoo¦pid he had destroyed him. Wherfore Seneca saith. loke dayly to haue of other / as thow intendist to do to other And this is oftyn prouyd by experience.
¶ of man and woman. Dialogo. CXXI. MAn aftir the saynge of the Philosofre Is a mynde incarnate. A Fantasye of tyme. A beholder of lyfe. A Māciple of deth. A walker goynge A dweller of a place. A laboryows mynde. An habi¦tacle of small tyme. A woman as saith the philosofre / is the confusyon of man / A beaste insaci¦able / a continuall besynesse. a batell neuer endid / mānis māciple & to a continent man destruccyon / As vppon a tyme it happid / yt a man which was clene & chaste desi∣red to haue famylyarite / & speche with a womā. wher∣by he fell to delectacyon & was cawght in the nettys of synne / and lyghtly loste the seale of chastite & comytted dedly synne. For whā he attendyd vnto the swettenes∣se of her speche / & behyld the beawte of her face / he was ouercome & destroyde / & sayde. Many mennys myndes for women be broke And wowndyd sorer then with other strooke Wherfor an Autowr spekyth & saith / A Womā is the fourme of synne / & condicyonyd dedly / Ihero¦nie saith. The gate of the Fende / The waye of wyckednesse. The strooke of the Serpente / A noyable kynde is the woman. That same doctowr saith / The beawte of womā is lyke a brinninge sworde. Remem∣byr yt Thamar was corrupte of her owne brodir / & euer remembyr yt a woman put Adā from his possession. who was strenger than Samson / wyser then Salamon / mo¦re holy then dauyd / & all these were subuertid by womē It is wrytten Eccle: xxv / The oryginal of synne begā of a womā / & all men suffir dethe / by ye meanys of her / wherfore these olde Fadirs & philosofirs were very cō∣tynente
& kepte them self chaste / as tellith Vigecius li∣bro secundo. of the continence of alexāder / yt whā a may¦de of most excellent beawte was brought to him / which was weddyd to an other prince / he sparyd her / & vtter∣ly abstaynyd him self from her / In so moche yt he wolde not see her / But sent her agayn to her husbond / & whā she was so remytted & sent agayne / it pleasyd gretly ye myndes both of her husbonde & of her / a lyke tale tel∣lith Valery libro quarto / cap / iii / of Scypione / saynge yt whā he knewe yt a mayde moost bewtifull was among them of cartage yt were besegyd / which was weddyd to a nobyll gentylmā / after yt this Scipion had wonne ye cite he callyd the Frendes of the sayde mayde / and also her husbonde before him / & delyuerde her to him a clene mayde / & all the Golde yt was brought to him for redē∣pcyon of her / he gaue it to her maryage / wherfore ye har¦tys of them were euir aftyr aplyed towarde him / For his grete chastite and bounteuous largesse / Valery al∣so tellyth in yt same chapitle / of the meruelowse chastite of zenocrates a philosofre saynge / That on a tyme atte athenys a compeny of yonge men promysed a grete sum¦me of money to a wantonly disposyd womā / yf she cow¦de corrupte the mynde of the sayde philosofre and yncly¦ne it to lechery / The which womā in the nyghte tyme went and laye downe by him. But in nowyse she cowde preuayle to hurte his chastite / & to the yonge men yt de¦rydyd her / yt she cowde not bowe his mynde. She an∣swerd yt she had not go to no lyuely mā / but rather to a statue / or dede Image. She callyd the philosofre a sta∣tue. For the greate and immoueable continence that re¦gnyd in him.
Of Lyfe and Deth. Dialogo .cxxii. AS saith the Philosofre deth is a per∣petuall sleape / drede of richemen / desi¦re of pouer men. An incurable happe the theef of man / the chacer of lyfe. Resolucyon of man. The lyfe of gode men is gladnesse. Of wretchis sadnes¦se / A yonge man vppon a tyme / that was in his flowris / both goodly of persone. Ryche / strō¦ge / and hoole / went to deth and sayde. O ineuitable for¦tune / haue mercy vppon me / and be deprecable vnto me and suffir me neuer to be punyshed / with the payne yt I loke aftir daylye fro the. For I shal gyue to ye what someuit thow wilt haue / that is to saye. Golde / Syl∣uer / Precyows stonys / Seruauntis / horse / londes / ly∣ueloade / Palacys / Possessions / all oonly the to towche
not me. To whom deth answerde and sayde. Brother thow askyste thinges impossible. Nothinge shuld be de¦sired of God / but honest and possible. And therfor thou spekist not wysely. For it is sayd vnto man. Deth aby¦dith the euery where. And yf thou be wyse / thow shalt abyde it in euery place. For it is wrytten psal. lxxxviii Who is that man that lyuyth / and shall not see deth / as whoo sayth. Noon. Therfore receyue me pacyently for I come to the to do no noueltye. For Seneca saith. Noman is so vnwise / but he knowith he shaldye. Ne∣uerthelesse whan deth drawith nere he dredith and we¦pith. Why wepist thou man. Why mournyst thow for cawse of deth. To that thow were ordeyned and borne what thinge of newe is done to the. To this law thou art born. This happid to thifader / to thimoder / to thy bettirs also. and generally to all that haue bene before the / and it shall not fayle to come to all them that shal be. For lyfe is not geuyn to any creature with excepcy∣on of deth. Ther is a law vnyuersall / which ordeynith to be born and to dye all thinge that berith lyfe. And al¦so he saith. We owe to suffir pacyently that thing that we may not escape fro. Example of Dauid that sayde whan his childe was dede. Nowe that he is dede why doo I faste. whether I may call him agayne. I shal ra∣ther go to him / for he shal not retourne to me. Whan it was shewyd vnto a philosofre that his sonne was ded he answerde and sayde. whan I gate him. I knew he shulde dye. Valery tellyth li .v .ca .x. that Anaxago¦ras herynge the deth of his sonne / sayde to the messen∣gere. Thow bringest me no newe tydynges. Nor merue lowse. I knewe him mortall / as sone as I knewe hym born. For of the lawe of nature I haue lernyd lyfe to be takyn and lefte. And no man can dye / but he that hath
leuyd. Nor no man maye lyue but he shall dye natural∣ly / In the same place it is made mencyon / yt zenophon heringe the deth of his eldest sonne which was slayne in batell was contente / aloonly he put the crowne frō his heede / for he was doynge solempne sacryfice. And aftirward he inqueryd how his sonne dyed / and it was shewyd him that he was slayne moost manly fighting and he sware by his goddis to whom he dyd sacrifice yt he conceyuyd more gladnesse therof / then henynesse of his deth. Sainte Ierome tellyth that an holy woman / and mooste noble / whan her husbonde was dede whō she especyally louyd and mournyd and his body lay vn¦buryed in the same daye of his buryinge she loste tway sonnes which she hadde and no moo. I am to tell a thin¦ge incredyble saith saynt Ierome / but God by wytnes∣se not false. Who wold not haue trowyd / that she my∣ghte a goone pluckynge her brestis / her clothis teryng her herys downe hangynge / certaynly from her fel not a droope of terys. She stoode immoueable / and fallynge downe to the feete of cryste / she helde them and sayde / I am spedde good lorde and redy to thy seruyce / for thou hast dischargyd me of so greate a burdon. It is redde al¦so in the cronycles of Emperowrs / that the wyse of Oc¦tauyan buryed her sonne namyd druse. And though she were a paynyme / neuerthelesse by the greate Naturall sense that was in her / she put from her all the tokyns of merowre and heuynesse / that were in her and sayde. What profit is to drede that may not be reuokyd / wher¦fore Seneca saith / a wyseman is not afflycte for losse of his children or frendes. For in suche mode he may su¦stayne ther deth / as he daylye awaytith for his owne. And truly the Remembraunce of deth is lyke a brydell refraynynge a man that he efflowe not to moche / and
Rynne in the greate brede of couetyse and lechery. The meditacyon of deth. Is moost greate philosofre as saith Plato. Wherfore it is tolde in the lyfe of Saynt Iehan the ampuere. That in the olde tyme aftir that an Em¦perowre was crownyd / by the Eleccyon of his Lordes / Immediatelye masons / and makers of tombis wente vnto him and sayde. O Emperowre of what stone or metall wylt thow commaunde thy graue to be made. They shewyd this vnto him that he shulde knowe & remembyr that he was transitorye / and but a corrupti¦ble man / & that he shulde thinke on the wele of his sow¦le / and gide the reeme wysely and vertuowsly / aftir ye saynge of Scrypture Eccle .vi. Remembyr thy last thin¦gis / and thow shalt neuer synne. Alfonse tellyth in his tretyse de Prudencia. That whan Alexander was de∣de and to him was made a Sepulchre of Golde / many philosofres came thedir togider. And oon of them sayde Alexander made his Tresowre of Golde / and nowe in contrarywyse Golde hath made Cresowre of him / an othir sayde. Alexander yisterdaye rulyd people / & nowe people maye soone Rule him / an othir sayde. yistirdaye alexander myght haue delyueryd manyon from deth. This daye he cowde not escape from the dartys of deth that were caste to him. an othir sayde. alexander yistir∣daye led a greate hoste. This daye of them he is ledde to his graue / an othir / yistirday alexander pressyd the erthe. This daye he is pressyd of the erthe. an other. yi∣sterdaye moch people dredde alexander / this daye they despise him. an other. yisterday had many frendes. this day al be equal with hī. an other. yisterday to hī sufficid not al ye world / this daye is he content with a graue of .vii. foote longe. He that inwardely wolde oftyn consy∣dre this / shulde be refraynyd frome the fowle apetyte
of synne. It is sayde of a lyuynge man / that he shallbe destroyde at last / and rote lyke a downghil. Iob .xx. Therfore it is commaundyd Ecclesiast .vii. Remembir the ende. For it is bettyr to goo to an hows of lamenta¦cyon and wepinge / than to an hows of welfare & glad∣nes. For ther as is mourninge / the laste ende of euery Creature is remembryd. And a man thinkyth what shall fall to him self / that is to saye that he shall come to suche an ende. Therfore attende ye and consydre wel that in the deth of euery creature / the noose waxith col¦de / the teth blacke. The face waxith pale / the vaynys and synowys of the body breke. The harte as it is say∣de deuydeth a sondir for greate paynes. Al the lymmes and membris waxe drye / and styfe lyke Tymber / and stoonys / Nothinge in all this worlde is so abhominable and tedyows as is a dede corps / It is not caste in to wa¦tirs for cause of infeccyō. It is nat hangid in ye ayre / for corrupcyon. But lyke poyson most perylows / It is cast in to a pytte no more to be sene / and erth is lyghtlye cast on it. Beholde the ioye of the worlde howe it endith. It is closyd in a moost stynkynge dyche. where the harte consumyth. The Iendrye vp. The erys fall from the hede. The noose rotith from the face. The tonge styn∣kith in the mowth. The harte putrifieth in the bodye. But alas alas goode lorde to me. what shuld these yen delyghte to see fayre thinges. The erys te here vany∣teys. The noose to smell swete thinges. The tonge to speke fowle thinges and vnprofitable. The mowth to taste swete thinges. The harte to thinke vayne and vyle thinges. wherfore Bernarde saith. why art thou prowde / thow asshyn and duste. The concepcyon of the is synne. Thy byrth is mysery. Thy lyfe is payne / and deth is greate angwyssh. As this Figure shewith.
Not oonly of sympel powre wretchis / but also of al ma¦ner of noble estatys / both Emperowr kynge & knight whiche must chaunge this transitory lyfe / and folowe the Daunce of deth / throughe age his harte is heuy / his hede akyth / his spirite is vexyd / his breth stinkith his face ryuelyth / his backe stowpith. His Ien waxe dymme. His erys Ronne. His Herys fall awaye. His teth stinke / He lesyth his strenghtis. Now is he gladde Now is he sadde / Nowe is he syke. O myserable and wretchid condycyon. why beholdist not thow the myse¦ry of this mortall lyfe. Consydre where by thy geny∣towris
thy frendes and antecessowris / that occupyed he¦re before the. and bernarde saith. Tell me where be the louers of this wolde / that in shorte tyme paste were he¦re with vs. Nothinge remaynyth of them / but oonlye asshyn. and therfore I praye the / tell me where be the Barownys. Where be the princes and rulers / Where be the prymatis. Certaynly they be passyd lyke a sha∣dowe / and come to nothinge / also saynte augustyn sait Goo to the graue and take vppe the bonys / and discer¦ne yf thow canste / which was a lorde. which was a ser¦uaunte / which was fayre / whiche was fowle. whiche was riche / which was pouer / which was wyse / which was Idyote / and thow mayste not knowe in nowyse. Therfore remembyr fro whense thow comyste / and be ashamyd / where thou arte / and make mournyng / whe¦dir thou goyste / and be aferde / that thow mayst come to that celestial place aboue. From the which thowe arte nowe expulsyd / which that moost blessid lor∣de graunt vnto vs that lyuyth and regnith eternally. amen. ¶ Thus endith the Dialogus of Creatures Moralysed.
