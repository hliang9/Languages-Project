HIS MAJESTIES SPEECH, TO The Members of both Houses Assem∣bled at Oxford, the seventh of February, 1643. My Lords and Gentlemen, I Have hardly thus long for∣born to give you thanks for the care and pains you have taken for the publique safety since your coming together. And first I thank you for your inclination to Peace; to which as My willingnesse of complying shewed the constancy of My endeavours in the best way for the publique good, so the Rebels by their scornfully rejecting your Over∣tures
(as they have done heretofore Mine) have shewed their constancy in their way. Next, I must thank every one of you, for so cheerfull applying your selves to the maintenance and recruiting of My Army, which I hope God will so blesse, that there∣by these enemies of Peace shall have their due reward. And truly (My Lords and Gentlemen) this Alacrity of yours for providing for My Army, doth please Me in no consideration so much, as that it is the best way for Peace; for certainly this strange Arrogancy of refusing to Treat with you, can proceed from nothing but their contempt of Our Forces; But it is your present honour, and will be more to Posterity, that God hath made you In∣struments to defend your Soveraign, and to preserve your Countrey; To see that Religion and Law to flourish which you have rescued from the violence of Rebel∣lion; For which I hope in time to recom∣pence every one of you: But if I shall not, here is One I hope will, in which He shall but perform my Commands. For I have
no greater sadnesse for those who are My ill Subjects, then I have joy and com∣fort in your affections and fidelities. And so God prosper your Proceedings. FINIS.
