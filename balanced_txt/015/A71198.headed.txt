FOR ENGLANDS Information, &c. IN these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal So∣veraign His Majesty of Great Britain, great things are to be done and brought about for the Glory, and the great Glory of the God of Heaven; for the Credit of his Holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Exaltation of our Royal Soveraign His Majesty of Great Britain, above all Heathen Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World; that so many Nations may be freed from Slavery, and throughout the whole World there may be great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity, which will be brought about in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign; but not by the Wisdom and the Power of Mortal Men, but by the Wisdom and the Power of the God of Heaven; but he has stirr'd me up for the Glory of his great Name, to have
his Enemies brought to shame, and his Annointed, His Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England, throughout the whole World, to great Honour, Renown, and Fame; for to make use of the Wisdom, the Power; and the Strength of Men, but not to trust to any of them. In these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, will the Righteous Flourish, and in his days there will be abundance of Peace; so that Righteousness will run down like a mighty Stream, and Truth and Peace will kiss each other: so that His Majesties Royal Throne will be esta∣blished in Righteousness, and the Workers of Ini∣quity, the Seed of Evil Doers, the Children of Disobedience, who are Unbelieving Jews, Bru∣tish Atheists, Wicked and Bloody Papists, and Rebellious Dissenters; and Sectaries will be a∣fraid and ashamed to come into His Majesties Royal Presence; so that His Majesties Royal Court will be the most Holiest Court in the World, and these sinful and divided Kingdoms, that have for a long time been vexed and perplexed with Contentions and Divisions, will become the most Renowned Kingdoms under the Heavens, for U∣nity, Peace and Concord, for Piety and Vertue, for Wisdom, Power, and Strength, for Honour, Riches, and great Glory; so that in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, we shall soon become the Wonder and the Glory of the World, the Crown of Kingdoms, the Desire and the Delight of Nations, the Joy of the whole Earth, and the City of the Great
King; who can and will give us every good thing that is suitable and seasonable, profitable, com∣fortable, and advantagious, for the great Honour and Exaltation of his Annointed, His Majesty of Great Britain, and for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of many Kingdoms; which will bring great Joy and Triumph to the Church of Eng∣land, and great Shame, Contempt, and Terror to the Turk, the Pope, and the Devil, and all the Workers of Evil; to him that believeth, all things are possible, though to the Eye of Sense and Reason, it may seem very difficult; that which is above Nature will be brought about by him, that is partaker of the Divine Nature, and that without having a Sword in the Hand, or Men or Money at Command. Mans Extremity it is Gods Opportunity for to help a Person, a Family, a City, and a Kingdom; when that many Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men, may be at a stand, for to bring Order out of Confusion, Light out of Dark∣ness, Good out of Evil, and Peace out of Trouble; then the Lord of Hosts, who has all Power in his own Hand, and all Men and Angels at Command, knows when, how, and by whom, he pleaseth for to make bare his Arm, though it be by a weak and an unlikely Man: for his Arm is very long, and very strong; and that his Enemies will know in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, to their great shame and overthrow. Religion, It is not a business of Discourse, as many have made it, to no purpose; but it is a
business of the highest Nature, and the greatest Conquest; it will inable a Man for to deny him∣self, and to injoy himself in the want of many things; and in the enjoyment of all things, the greatest Freedom is the freedom of the Mind, the greatest Liberty is the liberty of the Will, the greatest Power is over Sin and the Devil, and the greatest Victory, Victory over the World; for to live above the World, while one lives in the World, above the Profits and Pleasures of this World; for the World passeth away and the things thereof, but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever: Now this is the Will of God, That all the Sons and the Daughters of Men, should be∣lieve in his Son, who is the high and mighty One; King of Kings, and the onely Ruler of Prin∣ces; who doth from his Throne behold all the Dwellers upon Earth: What they are, and who they are that be for him or against him, in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain: Who are they that be against him, who is altogether lovely, or can be against him? Worthy to be de∣sired and admired by all, and to be beloved a∣bove all, and more than all; because that he is the chiefest of Thousands, and of Ten thousands, of Men or Angels; be they never so Wife, Strong, Rich, and Honourable. By him, and for him, it is that Kings do Reign, and in the World remain; he sets them up, and keeps them up for his own Will and Pleasure; they are not set up and kept up for the Will and Pleasure of the Pope, nor the
Church of Rome; neither have they any power for to Oppose, Depose, and to Dethrone them when they please, nor as they please. Therefore well might our late Royal and Gracious King de∣mand, and demand again, by what Power, and who gave them that Power, for to Try, Examine, Judge, and Condemn him, who was their Right and Lawful Soveraign? They had not their Power from God nor good Men, but from the Pope and the Devil in Hell, who in them did dwell. The Church of Rome has too many Children among the Dissenters and Sectaries in England; from her they did learn for to take away the Life of our late Royal and Gracious Soveraign. The Pope and the Devil in Hell would have all Men to Rebel, but not in Grace and Vertue to excel: But the time is come, that in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, that all the Workers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil Doers, the Children of Disobedience, will be a∣shamed and confounded for what they have done. For that God, who is most Great and most Good, most Wise and most Strong, to whom Vengeance doth belong; though he be slow to Anger, yet is he great in Power: Who has stirr'd me up for to engage with him, for to make known his mind, what he will have done in the Reign of his Annointed and our Royal Soveraign: He will have Inquisition made for the Blood of his Ser∣vants that has been slain, by the Turk, the Pope, the French King, and the King of Spain; and for that precious and innocent Blood of his be∣loved
Son, Holy Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs; and for that late Martyr and worthy Knight, Sir Edmundbury Godfrey. All these have been un∣worthily and most cruelly put to Death, by un∣reasonable, bloody, and deceitful Men; such as unbelieving Jews, bruitish Athiests, wicked and bloody Papists, and rebellious Dissenters and Se∣ctaries. These be they that will neither Reform nor Conform, but daily against the Church of England storm: But they be not so many and great, but a Man of Wisdom and Courage will bring them down to His Majesties Royal Feet: For by Divine Wisdom he will so procure them, that it is not the Devil that can secure them: And by Divine Power he will prepare Work to be managed by them, that have Power in their Hand, and Men and Money at command, that they may be sub∣dued both by Sea and Land. The right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass, when he doth make bare his Arm; for his Arm is very long and very strong, and that his Enemies shall know to their great shame and overthrow. The right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass, above the Wisdom, the Power, and the Strength of Men. The right Hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass when he will, and by whom he will; above the Wisdom, the Power, and Strength of all the Angels in Heaven. The Lord of Hosts can make use of Angels or Men, to make known his Mind in the World; but he will not put trust in any of them. He can use them or refuse them; he can work with them
or without them: The greatest work that ever was done, it was by the Wisdom of the Father and the Son, not by the Wisdom and Power of Angels or Men; and that was the Creation of the World and the Redemption of Man. With whom took he Counsel when he laid the Foun∣dation of the Earth, or found out a Ransom for lost Man? His right Hand and Holy Arm did work the greatest Salvation; he laid Help upon one that is mighty and willing to save unto the uttermost, all that come unto him: He is not willing that any should miscarry, but that all should come to the knowledge of him. But the Church of Rome and the Pope of Rome, don't care how many do miscarry, and how few comes to the knowledge of him, who is the Wisdom of his Father, the Brightness of his Glory, the Express Image of his Person: who doth uphold all things by the Word of his Power; for by him were all things created that are in Heaven and that are in Earth, visible and invisible; whether they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities or Powers: All things were created by him and for him; he is before all things, and by him all things consist; all Persons and all Nations; for he is the most Royal Head, over all Men and Angels: He is the First-born from the Dead, that in all things the might have the preheminence, because he was and is most worthy; but not the Pope, who is most unworthy: but they that exalt themselves, shall be abased, but they that humble themselves, will be exalted. As before Honour goes Humi∣lity,
so Pride goes before a Fall. The Lord he knoweth the Proud afar off; he knows them, not to assist them, but to resist them; and that ma∣ny times by weak and unlikely means. He hath shewed Strength with his Arm, he hath put down the Mighty from their Seat, the Proud, and the mighty Angels; and so he will in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal So∣veraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, the Turk, the Pope, the French King, and the King of Spain, and all the Enemies of his Gospel, that will not conform and reform to the Protestant Religion, as it is established in the Church of England; which doth teach the Sons and the Daughters of Men to know the True God and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent; for there is no Name under Heaven whereby Jew or Gentile, Bond or Free, Male or Female, High or Low, Rich or Poor, can be saved, but by him, who is the Rock of A∣ges, and the Fountain and Foundation of all true Honour and Happiness. It is Mans greatest Wis∣dom to know him, so as to be reconciled to him, to be made one with him, and to abide in him; and it is Mans greatest Honour to serve him, who is the Lord of Life and the King of Glory; and it will be Mans greatest Happiness to enjoy him, in whose Presence is fulness of Joy, and at whose right Hand are Pleasures for ever∣more, that are abiding, satisfying, lasting, and everlasting. As for the Honours, the Riches, and the Pleasures of this World, they be uncertain and deceitful, not satisfying nor long lasting. There
is a Vanity in the things of this World, and ma∣ny times great Trouble and Vexation with them. The best improvement of time in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal So∣veraign, it is to improve the Mind with Graces that are Divine; then will a Mans Fruit be bet∣ter than Gold; for to Revive, Refresh, Counsel, Comfort, and Strengthen Fellow Members, Fel∣low Soldiers, Fellow Labourers, Fellow Travel∣lers, and Fellow Citizens in the Wilderness of this World. In Mans greatest Extremity God has found out a Remedy; for it pleased the Father, that in his Son, his beloved Son, who is Heir of all things, that in him should all Fulness dwell; Fulness of Merit, Fulness of Spirit, Fulness of Wisdom, to direct them that believe in him; Ful∣ness of Power to protect them that own him and appear for him, and Fulness of Grace and Glory to reward them that be Fruitful and Faithful to him in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain; that among all People, in all Nations, there may be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace. Let all that can Pray, Pray that all Jews, Turks and Infidels, all Atheists, Papists, Dissenters and Sectaries, would all endeavour with one Heart and Mind to know the True God and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent; and as with one Shoulder to serve him, and with one Mouth to praise him, as they do in the Church of England. Then will all Strife, Contention, and Wars cease; and then throughout the whole
World there will be great Joy, Prosperity and Peace: That this may be, the God of Peace has continued the Gospel of Peace from Generation to Generation, that throughout the whole World there may be a general Reformation. For a long time the Lord of Hosts, in these days of the Go∣spel, has sought for a Man among the Wise, God∣ly, and the Learned of the Land, that should stir up himself to engage with him and for him, to make known his mind upon so Noble a Design, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Man∣kind: but when the great and the mighty God, the Searcher of all Hearts, sees that among the Sons of Men, most are Self-seekers, Men-pleasers, Lovers of themselves more than Lovers of God, the King our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain and the Church of England; it is no wonder that the Lord doth then make bare his Arm, and manifest his Wisdom and Power in Mans Weakness, that all the Glory may redound to him, and that no Flesh should Glory before him. It is a wonder to me, and to many may be, that the Lord of Hosts should stir me up for to engage with him and for him, in so high and honoura∣ble a Work, who am most unworthy, and least un∣able; but my Self-sufficiency it is from Gods All-sufficiency; though I am Weak he is Strong, though I am Poor yet he is Rich, and very Rich; be∣cause he can scatter all my Fears, break all my Snares, resolve all my Doubts, and supply all my Wants; that can pardon all my Sins, that be ma∣ny and great, and heal all my Diseases, both in
Soul and Body. What can be not do? What will he not do for them that do trust in him, before the Sons of Men? and more than in any of them: For though the Sons of Men may be used, yet they are to be no further trusted, than they be faithful to the God of Heaven, to his Majesty of Great Britain, and to the Protestant Religion. When I was resolved to engage with the God of Heaven in so Noble a Design, for to make known his Mind in time, I did not consult with Flesh and Blood, not with my own Ease and Safety, but I did labour to deny my self, and over∣come my self, that I might the better lay out my self in his Service, whose Service is perfect freedom, and his Work and Reward it is most Honoura∣ble. Therefore whatever any of the Sons of Men do lose in denying themselves, in overcoming of themselves, and in laying out themselves, in the Service of God, they will be great Gainers in the work of God. It is high and great Honour, for any of the Sons of Men, to work with the God of Heaven, for to make known his mind, in time, for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, and the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity, of many Nations. The humble, the God of Heaven doth condescend to teach many things in secret, that are to be made known in due time, for the good of the Publick. There is no man born for himself, but every man is born for the Publick Good. To be good, and to do good unto the Sons of Men, doth most resemble the God of Heaven, who is good, and doth good, and is never weary of doing good; both to many persons and many Nations; nay, to all
Persons in all Nations, that do desire and endea∣vour to Know, Fear, Love, Serve, and to Honour him, in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign. Let the Wise, God∣ly, and the Learned of the Church of England, consider if it be not time for the Lord of Hosts for to make a man strong for himself and his Annoin∣ted his Majesty of Great Britain; when that too many have made themselves strong for this Party and that Party, for this Opinion and that Opi∣nion, against the God of Heaven, his Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England; but what will they get but Shame and Confusion: for they will be brought down, and that with a Wit∣ness, and that without having a Sword in my hand, or Men, or Money at command: Religion doth not teach men to be Clowns, Fools, Tray∣tors, nor Mad-Men, as too many have been, a∣gainst the Protestant Religion, his Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England: But Reli∣gion teaches Men to be wise and faithful, to know how to keep the Peace in their own Persons; and to be very Valourous and Couragious, for the great Honour of God, the King and Nation, in their Place and Generation. It is a great Vanity for the Sons and the Daughters of Men, for to make a noise about Religion, for this Party and that Party, for this Opinion and that Opinion, to the great shame and Reproach of the Protestant Religion, and the Church of England; and much Trouble, but no Profit, Comfort, or Honour, to our Royal Soveraign his Majesty of great Britain. The
great Contentions and the needless Disputings that many have made about Religion, and the Power of Godliness, it has tended not to Edificati∣on, Reformation, and the Consolation of Persons and Families; but it has tended to the great Shame, Condemnation, and Desolation of many Persons and Families in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, to the wounding of the Body, and to the Dishonour of the Head. The Power of Godliness, that has been so much contended for by them that have made seperation from the Church of England, and yet not well understood nor practised by many of them, it will enable Men to be of a meek and a quiet Spirit, a humble and a thankful Spirit, a cheerful and a contented Spirit, and a wise, faith∣ful valourous and a couragious Spirit, in the service of God, and for the great Honour and Glory of God; for the credit of his Holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Reli∣gion, for the great Exaltation of the Lords Annoin∣ted his Majesty of great Britain, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, and for the great Peace and Prosperity of many Kingdoms. The Power of Godliness, it will enable Men to live Conquerours in the World, and to die Conque∣rours over Sin, Death, Hell, and the Devil, and all the Workers of Evil, and that without making a noise about Religion, for this Party or that Par∣ty, or for this Opinion or that Opinion: Yea, without making of many Words, or having the Voice much heard. The Power of Godliness it is the Power of Faith, and the Power of Faith it is the
Power of the great and mighty God, which will enable a Man to overcome much Evil in his own Person, and to procure Peace and Prosperity to a Nation, by understanding the mind of the God of Heaven, and by making of it known in time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind. The Power of Faith, which is the Power of God, it is not the Power of the Sword; for the Gospel, which is the glad Tydings of Salvation, was never purchased or settled by the Sword of Man, but it was purchased by the Blood of him who is God and Man in one Person, who is the Saviour of all Men, but especially of them that believe in him, and make an Improvement of him, who is the chief∣est in Heaven. Happy be they that make him the Chiefest in their own Souls, for they that find him, find Life; and will obtain favour of the Lord: but they that hate him, love Death. The Power of Faith is the Power of God, and not the Power of the Sword; then let all that handle the Sword Perish with the Sword, in these Gospel days, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, that do take it up in an Unlawful manner, and to an Un∣lawful end, that do take it up to hinder the Spread∣ing of the Gospel where it is not, or the Success of it where it is; that do take it up without the Com∣mand of Authority, and do use it against the Per∣sons in Authority, for to undermine and over∣throw the Protestant Religion, and his Majesty of Great Britain; in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign. Let not any despise the day of small things, for by Might and

Power, trusting to an Arm of Flesh, as Carnal Wis∣dom, Power, and Strength, shall not any prevail; not the Turk, nor the Pope, nor the French King, nor any that do Assist him against the Protestant Religion, his Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England, but against all Carnal Wisdom, Power and Strength, will the Lord of Hosts pre∣vail, in this Day of his Power, for the Glory of his great Name, to have his Enemies brought to Shame, and his Annointed his Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England, throughout the whole World, to great Honour, Renown, and Fame. Who knows the Wisdom, the Power, and the Strength of that Man, whom Almighty God has made strong for himself, with himself, and in him∣self, who has all Power in his own hand, and the whole Creation at Command. What can he not do, what may he not do, what will he not do, in his Generation, for the great Honour of God, the King and Nation? Even that which many Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men have not done in many Generations; and why, because that they be too apt to trust to their own Wisdom, Power, and Strength, more than in the Lord Jehovah, in whom is Everlasting Strength, Everlasting Wisdom and Power, Everlasting Peace and Joy, and Ever∣lasting Honour and Glory: When this great and mighty God doth stir up a Man for to engage with him and for him, to bring Glory to his great Name, his Enemies to great Shame, and a King and Kingdom to great Honour, Renown and Fame, he doth not tell him that Men and Money shall be
sufficient for him, but that his Grace shall, and his Spirit will; which is better then Strength or Wea∣pons of War, or Silver or Gold: All things, are not to be compared to the Wisdom, Power, and Strength of the Spirit of God working in a Man, and working for him: It is not in the Pow∣er of Wise, Strong, Rich, or Learned Men, for to order their Thoughts, to compose their Mind, to frame any Noble Design, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind: And the Reason is, because the way of Man is not in him∣self: It is not in Man that walketh, for to direct his own steps, much less to order his thoughts; but the steps of a good Man, and so his thoughts, are or∣dered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way; for the way of the Lord is Strength to the Upright: but Destruction shall be to all the Workers of Ini∣quity, because that their trust is in Carnal Wis∣dom, Power, and Strength. The Hope of the Righ∣teous is Gladness, because they trust in the Lord, who is the Creator of Heaven and Earth; but the Expectation of the Wicked, of all the Workers of Iniquity, shall Perish, because that they do put too much trust in Mortal Men, who are sinful Creatures, and soon turned to Dust. The Lord of Hosts, when he pleases, can, and will, and doth, make use of Angels and Men, to make his mind known in the World; yet in point of trust, he chargeth his An∣gels with Folly, and putteth not trust in his Saints; for the Heavens are not pure in his Sight, how much less Man that is born of a Woman, and the Sons of Men, that are but as Worms? For what is
Man, that the great and mighty God should be mindful of him, or any of the Sons of Men; that he should regard, when that Man in his best Estate in this World, is but Vanity: therefore all be exhorted to cease from putting too much Trust and Consi∣dence in Men, whose Breath is in their Nostrils: For wherein are they to be accounted of? No farther nor no longer, than they be faithful to the God of Heaven, to his Majesty of Great Britain, to the Protestant Religion, as it is Establish't in the Church of England, in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign: Wo be unto the World, because of Offences; not only wo be un∣to unbeleving Jews, bruitish Atheists, and wicked and bloody Papists: But wo be to all them that be a Knowing People, and a Proud, Stubborn, and Re∣bellious People, that have made Religion a business of Discourse to no purpose; by contending for this Party and that Party, for this Opinion and that Opinion; to the great Shame and Reproach of the Protestant Religion, and the Church of England: Who by their Pride have made Separation, Sepa∣ration has caused great Contentions, and Conten∣tions sad Divisions, and Divisions great Disorder and Confusion, both in Church and State; to the great Trouble, Contempt, and Grief, both of Ma∣gistrates, and Ministers: so we, that might have been the Glory of Kingdoms, and a Terrour to our Enemies; our Contentions and Divisions, have made us a Terrour to our selves, and a Shame to our Enemies, and whence comes this, but from that Stubborness and Rebellion that is in most
against the Government, both in Church and State; as if it was unlawful to obey them, whom the most high hath set over us; although we are com∣manded from the Word of Truth that every Soul should be subject to the highest Powers: for there be no Powers but of God. The Powers that be, are ordained of God, therefore they that do resist the Powers, resist the Ordinance of God, and they that do so resist, will expose themselves not only to Condemnation, but to great Damnation: What am I among the Sons of Men, that the great and the mighty God should stir me up to Engage with him, for to Reprove, Rebuke, and to Condemn, so Stubbourn and Rebellious a Generation, that has too long disobeyed him and our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain? What am I? Am I not by Birth, Education, and Trade, inferiour to many, and by Nature, as bad as any? Am I not little in the Eyes of the World, and less in my own Eyes? But he that is mighty has magnified me for high Use and Service: He has Enabled me to be Partaker of the Divine Nature, which is high Honour, and great Favour; therefore let the Righteous be glad, and the Humble be thankful; but let all the Work∣ers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil doers, the Chil∣dren of Disobedience, who are Unbelieving Jews, Bruitish Atheists, wicked and bloody Papists, and Rebellious Dissentors and Sectaries, that will not Conform and Reform to the Protestant Religion, as it is Establish'd in the Church of England, be a∣shamed; which would have all the Sons and the Daughters of Men come to the Knowledge and the
Injoyment of the true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent; which would have all Men to be of one mind, to speak the same thing, and to Live and Love as Brethren, as Members of one Body, Govern'd by one Royal Head, who is the Lord of Life, and the King of Glory: Who will in these Days of the Gospel, Wound and Confound all his Enemies, that make Strife and Contentions and Divisions, to weaken his Body; to the Provo∣king of him, who is the Head of his Church: who will break all his Enemies with his Iron Rod, and Dash them in Pieces like a Potters Vessel, that will not submit unto his Gospel, which is the glad Tydings of Salvation, and the Scepter of his Grace; by which he will be known in all Paths and Places to be the Creator of Heaven, the Earth, and the Sea: Therefore in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, let all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World, be Wise, and all the Judges of the Earth be instru∣cted for to serve the Lord with Fear, and to rejoyce with Trembling, and to kiss his Son, who onely can deliver from Wrath to come, be∣fore he fall upon them; and there be not any that can deliver: For it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the ever-living God, who is and will be a consuming Fire to all the Workers of Iniquity, if that they will not learn to be Lovers of Righteousness, and to know when and how for to bring forth the Fruits of Righteous∣ness; which is Humility, Self-denial, Heaven∣ly-mindedness,
and Zeal for Gods Glory, for the Credit of his Holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Exaltation of His Majesty of Great Britain, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, and for the great Peace and Prosperity of many Kingdoms. Now is the Axe laid unto the Root of the Tree, therefore every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, such Fruit as is suitable and seasonable, profitable and comfor∣table, for the Honour of God, the King our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain; such Fruit as may revive and refresh the City of God, which is the Church of England: Such Trees will flourish in the Courts of Gods House, and bring forth Fruit in Old Age; but barren and unprofitable Trees, that have a name to live and are dead; that have called themselves Saints but have acted like Devils incarnat. Under pre∣tence of Religion many have acted Rebellion and Treason: These Trees, many have been cut down, and more will be cut down, for cumbering of the Ground. There is a time and a season for every purpose under the Sun, that is suitable and sea∣sonable, warrantable and lawful to be done; but there is no time in season or purpose, law∣ful for unreasonable, bloody and deceitful men; for to fire Houses, and to ruin Men, Women and Children; for to endeavour from time to time to undermine and overthrow the Protestant Religion, His Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England: as the Workers of Ini∣quity,
the Seed of Evil Doers, the Children of Disobedience, the Enemies of the Gospel and of the Protestant Religion, have endeavoured for∣merly and lately: Witness the Spanish Invasion in 1588. Since that the Gun-powder-Treason. And of late a Damnable and Bloody Plot, which should have been Acted in 1678. against the Kings most Sacred and Royal Person, to the Ruin of many Thousands in the Nation: but the God of Heaven who doth daily watch over his Majesties Royal Person and the Nation, will bring all the Workers of Iniquity, of a suddain to great Shame and Con∣fusion. Is not Destruction to the Wicked, and a strange Punishment to the Workers of Iniquity? Evil shall slay the Wicked, and they that hate the Righteous shall be Desolate, if that they will not learn to cease to do Evil, and learn to do well, and Endeavour in Grace and Vertue to Excel; for it is a great Madness and Folly for any of the Sons of Men, to be Actors and Factors for the Pope, and the Devil in Hell, against England's Royal Church and State, for to Rebel. Did ever any harden them∣selves against the God of Heaven and Prosper? What got Sisera, Jaben, Pharaoh, Saul, and Proud Haman? Were they not brought to Shame and Confusion? For they became as Dung upon the face of the Earth: so let all that be Enemies to the God of Heaven, to His Majesty of Great Bri∣tain, and to the Church of England, perish; but let them that love the God of Heaven, and de∣light to Honour the King, our Royal Soveraign, be like the Sun that goes forth in his Might; that
may give a greater and a better Light; for the great Joy and Comfort of many Persons, and the great Peace and Prosperity of many Nations: As Evil Men and Seducers, the Workers of Iniquity, and the Seed of Evil Doers, do what they can, that the Times may be the worse for them, and many the worse for the Times; so good Men, who are true Believers, the Lovers of Righteousness, must learn to be Workers of Righteousness, and to bring forth the Fruits of Righteousness; that so the Times may be the better for them, and many the better for the Times: The Righteous Lord, who is most Wise, and most Strong, meets him that Rejoyceth, and Worketh Righteousness, to Encourage and Assist him, or them; because that he knows that there be many that will Oppose and Resist them. The Lord doth many times meet the Workers of Iniquity, but not to Encourage them, but to Con∣found them, and to Destroy them, if that they will not in these Gospel Days, cease to do Evil, and learn to do well, then they will be above the fear of Death, or the hurt of Death; then they will live in the Fear of God, who is most good, and die in his Favour who is most great; who has Hea∣ven and Earth, and all things in them at Com∣mand, to Reward them that be Faithful and Fruitful, in their Generation. They that do Labour that their last work may be best, will in their last Days have the greatest Joy, Peace, and Rest: And though the work of Faith, and the labour of Love is not many times Regarded by the Sons of Men, yet is it always Regarded, and will be fully Rewarded
by the God of Heaven, who knows the Nature of it, and the worth of it, that it is more precious than Gold, and more worth than all the Crowns and Secpters in the World; because it will purifie the Foulest Heart, Strengthen the Weakest Me∣mory, and Comfort the Saddest Spirit, that is an Idle Faith that is not a Working Faith; Faith works by Love, and Love is stronger then Death, and that is a Dead Faith, that doth not produce Purificati∣on in the Heart, and Enable a Man for to Endeavour the Information, the Reformation, and the Exal∣tation of a City and a Kingdom, and that without making of many Words, or having the Voice much heard. Men are to be Vallued and Estemed by all Men, for their Wisdom and their Learning, for their Power and their Strength, for their Honours and their Riches, for their Great and High-Places, but most of all, for their Rich Graces, for their Faith, that works by Love; because it is a Wonder working Grace, a Victorious and a Glorious Grace: it will not only work Wonders in a Man, in Chang∣ing of him from Nature to Grace, and from Grace to Glory, but it will Enable a Man to prepare High and Honourable Work, Pleasant Profitable and Delightsom Work, for the great Honour and Ex∣altation of a Kings Person, and the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of many Nations. What I have affirmed, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Exaltation of His Majesty of Great Britain, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England; and for the great Peace and Prosperity of many King∣doms,
it is as good as Confirmed already; for Divine Faith, which is the Gift and Power of Almighty God, it is the Evidence of things not seen, and the Substance of things hoped for. As a Vertuous Woman is a Crown to her Husband, and the Glory of the Man; so a Wise, Faithful, Valorous, and a Couragous Man, is a Crown and a Glory to a King and Kingdome, he is a Crown and a Glory to the God of Heaven, he is a Crown and a Glory to all the Faithful Ministers of the Gospel in the Nation; because that he puts to his Seal, that God and his Word is true, and their Doctrines so far as they a∣gree thereto: He Crowns their Labours with Success, the Church of England with great Honour, Renown and Fame, and he Crowns all them that be Enemies to the Gospel, and the Protestant Re∣ligion, to His Majesty of Great Britain and the Church of England, with great Shame: Such a Man ought to be minded and regarded by the Wise, God∣ly, and the Learned. The Glory of this Noble De∣sign, that Divine Wisdom and Power has Enabled me for to make known in time, it is not to be gi∣ven to any Mortal Men, not to Wise, Strong, Rich, or Learned Men, when they have done all what they can, no nor to the Angels in Heaven, but let all People praise the Lord of Hosts in all Nations, for his great Wisdom and mighty Power, for his Right Hand and Holy Arm hath gotten himself the Victory, and will get himself the Victory, over all his Enemies both at home and abroad; for the Glory of his great Name, to have his Enemies brought to Shame, and his Holy Church through∣out
the whole World, to great Honour, Renown, and Fame, that so in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign His Ma∣jesty of Great Britain, many Nations may be freed from Slavery, and throughout the whole World there may be great Joy, Peace, and Pro∣sperity; this Noble Design, which Divine Wisdom, and Power has Enabled me for to make known in time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind, it is by John Varney a Member of the Church of England, and a Subject to His Majesty of Great Britain; but such a Subject that the God of Heaven has Honoured among the Sons of Men for to Engage with him, and for him, in high and Honourable Work, Pleasant, Profitable, and De∣light some Work, Victorious, Glorious, and Crown∣ing Work, that has not yet been done by all the Parliaments that have been since England has In∣joyed a King. There is not any of the Sons of Men, under the Canopy of Heaven, that has that Right and Title for me to Dedicate this Book unto, as our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, because that the Lord of Hosts has stirr'd me up for to Engage with him; he has made me strong in the Inward Man, for his own great Glo∣ry, and the great Honour, Renown, and Exaltati∣on of his Annointed our Royal and Gracious Sove∣raign, His Majesty of Great Britain, who has been a King of many Sorrows and Cares, but I shall Endeavour with Divine Wisdom and Power, which is better than Strength, or Weapons of War, or Silver or Gold, to set a work the Wisest
and the Learned'st in the Land, that our Royal Soveraign in these Days of the Gospel of Peace a∣mong the Sons of Men, may be the greatest and the best of Kings that ever did sway a Secpter, or wear a Crown: The God of Heaven has given me that Wisdom and Power, for to understand his mind, and to make it known in due time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind; that so many Nations may be freed from Slavery, and throughout the whole World, there may be great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Raign of our Royal Sove∣raign. The God of all Wisdom, Power, and Strength will make short work, but it will be quick and Powerful work, Victorious and Glorious work, o∣ver all his Enemies both at Home and Abroad; that so his Gospel, which is the Glad Tydings of Salva∣tion, may Run and be Glorified where it is not, and may Flourish where it is; that so his Wisdom, Power, Name and Way, may be more and more known upon Earth, and his saving Health among all Nations; that so the People may praise him, yea, that all People may praise him with new Obe∣dience, then will the Earth bring forth great In∣crease, and among all Nations in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Raign of our Royal Sove∣raign, there will be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace: The Righteous Lord may seem to be slow, to make good his Promises, but he is ve∣ry sure, the Vision it is for an appointed time, but he that shall come, whom the most Wise God will send, will come, and will not tarry, but will make
his way and break his way against much Oppositi∣on and Contradiction, against much weakness and many Infirmities: He that gives Strength to con∣ceive, will give Power to bring forth, he that gives Wisdom to Understand his mind, will give Power, to make it known in due time. The Lord of Hosts knows when, how, and in whom to arise, like a mighty Man, to set a work many Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men, that have their Wisdom, their Power, their Strength, their Honours and Riches, their great and high Places from him; that so they may Act for him in a high manner, and to a Right End. It is High and Honourable Work, that the God of Heaven has stirr'd me up for to En∣gage with him, and for him, and it will prove to His Majesty of Great Britain, and to the Church of England, Pleasant, Profitable, and Delight∣some Work, and over many Nations, Victorious, Glorious, and Crowning Work: It will Crown the God of Heaven with much Glory among the Sons of Men, and his Annointed, His Majesty of Great Britain, with great Honour and Power o∣ver them; over all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World, be∣cause that he is most worthy of that Honour Day by Day, from all Men both High and Low, from all Men both Rich and Poor, from all Men of all Degrees, in all Paths of Land and Seas. There∣fore let all them that be Subjects and Servants to our Gracious King, in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, strive each in their places to Honour him; for many will live to see, that in these Days
of the Gospel, that our Royal Soveraign will be the Chiefest and most Renowned Emperor in the World, and over the World, because that he has the greatest right unto it, and is most fittest for it: for there is no Emperor or King under the Heavens that is so great a Defender of the Faith, and the Faithful, as His Majesty of Great Britain is under God: As for the Turk, the Pope, the French King, and the King of Spain, they are not fit to be Em∣perors in the World, in these Days of the Gospel; because that they be Enemies to the Gospel, which is the glad Tydings of Salvation. They that be Enemies to the Gospel, are Enemies to the God of Heaven, to the Protestant Religion, to our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, and to the Church of England. And as they be not fit to be Emperors in the World, because they be E∣nemies to the Gospel; so they will never be Em∣perors over the whole World, because that their Subjects are both Fools and Salves: but our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain, has the greatest Right to be Emperor in the World, be∣cause that under the God of Heaven, he is the best, and the greatest Defender of the Gospel: And he is most fittest to be the Chiefest Emperor over the World, because that his Subjects do Injoy the greatest Liberty, and are Men of the greatest Wis∣dom, Courage, and Nobility. This should have been Discovered before now, by the Wise, Godly, and the Learned; and it might have been Recove∣red by them that have Power in their hand, and Men and Money at Command; and his Royal
Majesty would not have had so many Loyal and Faithful Subjects Destroyed, nor his Kingdoms so much Treasure Wasted and Consumed, as hath been by Unreasonable, Bloody, and Deceitful Men: but the Right Hand of the Lord will find out all his Enemies, both at Home and Abroad. A Noble Design well Discovered in time, is half Recovered, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prospe∣rity of Mankind: Well may it be said that Divine Wisdom is better than Strength, or Weapons of War, or Silver or Gold, or all things to be desired, is not to be Compared unto it; because it will En∣able a Man, for to Declare in time, what may be done, what will be done, and what is to be done, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of a King and Kingdom: It is Wisdom that dwells with Pru∣dence, and finds out Knowledge of Witty Inventi∣ons. Wisdom it is Profitable to Direct, and it will a Man safe Protect from many Dangers, that the Workers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil Doers, the Children of Disobedience, are daily subject un∣to. Therefore whatever Wisdom, Power, Cou∣rage, or any Grace, any Subject in England, Scot∣land, France, and Ireland, hath Received from the God of all Wisdom, Power, and Strength; it doth become them so to Prove and Improve them, that they may tend for the Glory of the Most High, and the great Honour and Renown of Englands Royal Majesty. It has been a great Shame to the Church of England, and to this Renowned Nation, for to consider how many have made a noise about Religion, for this Party and that Party, for this
Opinion and that Opinion; about the Power of Godliness, and the Power of Faith; and have not made it appear for the great Honour and Renown, the great Peace and Prosperity of Englands Royal Church and State. The Power of Faith, it is not in making of many words, or in taking up the Sword, that is made by Mortal Men. But the Power of Faith, it is the Power of God, making use of the Word of God, which is the Sword of the God of Heaven, which is sharp∣er than any Two-edged Sword made by Men: Be∣cause it is Piercing, even to the dividing a sunder, of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts, and Marrow, and is a descerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Hearts of all the Sons and Daughters of Men, that are, that have been, or ever will be in the World. This Word of God which is the Word of Life; and the Sword of the Spirit, it will Prevail, when that the Traditions, the Inventi∣ons, and the Lying Wonders of the Church of Rome shall fail: The Word of God abideth for ever, there∣fore that shall prevail, when that all Unbelieving Jews, Bruitish Atheists, Wicked and Bloody Pa∣pists; and Rebellious Dissenters, and Sectaries, that do trust to Carnal Wisdom, Power, and Strength; to this Party or that Party, to this O∣pinion or that Opinion; to their Estates or their Swords, their Hearts shall fail: Therefore in these Days of the Gospel of Peace, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Bri∣tain; Let all that handle the Sword, perish with the Sword; that do not use it in a right manner,
and to a Right End; that do not use it, for the Glory of the great and Mighty God, who is a Man of War and the God of Peace; and for the Credit of his Holy Gospel, which is the glad Ty∣dings of Salvation, and for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, for the great Exaltation of His Majesty of Great Bri∣tain, and the great Peace and Prosperity of his Kingdoms in these Days of the Gospel, which is the Day of Gods Power; and the great manifesta∣tion of his Patience, Wisdom, and Glory. Let not any despise the day of small things: For by Carnal Wisdom, Power, and Strength, shall not Unbeleiving Jews, Bruitish Atheists, Wicked and Bloody Papists, and Rebellious Dissenters, and Se∣ctaries prevail; but against all these will the Lord of Hosts prevail; and that when he please, and by whom he please: As it is the Prayer of the Mini∣sters of the Gospel, so it ought to be their great care in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, for to mind what they Sow in Weakness, in whom the Great and the Mighty God doth Raise in Power, or else they do but Undervalue their own Labours; and Encourage their Adversaries: For it is not enough for the Ministers of the Gospel, to Preach the Word of God, in Season, and out of Season, but they ought to mind who hath Be∣lieved their Report; and to whom is the Arm of the Lord Revealed: For his Arm is very long, and very strong; and that his Enemies will know in
these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign; to their great Shame and Over∣throw. The Great and the Mighty God, that gives Life to a Worm, can give Power to a Man, to make all his Enemies throughout the whole World to Tremble; And that without having a Sword in his Hand, or Men, or Money at Command. Therefore as my Heart is Ingaged for the God of Heaven, so it is Inraged against all them, that do Slight and Undervalue his Holy Word, and Question his Mighty Power: By the Power of God I am what I am; and will Labour to do what I can, that his Name and Works throughout the whole World may be known to be most Glorious; and His Majesty of Great Britain's Royal Person; Crown, and Kingdoms, most Renowned and Fa∣mous among all, and above all, Heathen and Po∣pish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World. If ever there was a time for to manifest the Pow∣er of Faith, for the great Honour and Renown of England's Royal Church and State, it is in such a time when that too many do Question the Truth of it; and few brings forth the Fruit of it, which is Love and Obedience to God and Man. Great is the Power of Faith, that doth inable a Mortal Man, to have Power with the God of Hea∣ven, to get Power from him, and to Act with Power for him, and that in the worst of times, and before the best of Men; in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain: That among all
People, in all Nations, there may be a general Re∣formation. Throughout the whole World; there must be but one Religion; and that is the Prote∣stant Religion, as it is Establish'd in the Church of England; for it is the true Religion, because it doth hold forth and declare the knowledge of the true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent: without Believing in him, and willing to be Ruled by him, there is not any of the Sons and Daugh∣ters of Men, that can be Saved. As for the Church of Rome, her Children can∣not Learn true Religion; because their Teachers are False Prophets, and Deceivers: Instead of Consolation, they do many times meet with Con∣demnation; and instead of Salvation, they be Ex∣posed to great Damnation: When the Blind Lead the Blind, they do fall into the Ditch: When the People are Ignorant, and their Teachers not Sound in the Faith, there cannot be a true Church, nor a good State: The Church of Rome, will in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Raign of our Roy∣al Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, be soon brought down; because that they stand upon a Sandy Foundation, as Tradition, and Lying Wonders: And their Trust and Considence it is in an Arm of Flesh, which is Carnal Wisdom, Power, and Strength, which has Decieved many, and will Deceive them. What saith the Lord, whose Word shall stand and prevail, when all their Wisdom, Power, and Strength, their Pride and Glory shall fail: Thus saith the Lord, Cursed be the Man, that trusteth in Man, and maketh Flesh his Arm;
Cursed be the Turk, the Pope, the French King, and the King of Spain, and all those that do use their Wisdom, their Power, and their Strength, to hinder the Gospel, in any Nation, that it should not prevail. The Jews, that do slight the Gospel, and deny Christ, cannot be Saved, but by looking up upon him, whom they have Pierced and Crucified: The Proud Turk, cannot be Saved by his Mahomet: It must be by the Gospel which doth hold forth Jesus Christ, who is the Lord of Life, and the King of Glory; who is ready and willing in all Nations, to save Sinners, that will deny their own Carnal Wisdom, Power, and Strength; he will give them Divine Wisdom, Power, and Strength; which will Enable them that do Injoy it, for to Under∣stand the mind of God, to do the will of God, and to Injoy the Favour of the Everliving God, which is better than Life, or all the Delights of this World: Because that the Church of England has kept the Word of Gods Patience, he will keep her in the hour of Temptation, which is come to try all Nations, in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain: Great will be the Peace, and the Prosperity of the Church of Christ, through∣out the whole World: For the Lord will Judge a∣mong al Nations, by his Word and Spirit; and will Rebuke all them that will not submit to the Gospel of his Son, which is the only means that the Wisdom of the Father has appointed for the Saving of lost Man; so that they that have trusted
to their Wisdom, their Power, and their Strength, will beat their Swords into Plow Shares, and their Spears into Pruining Hooks: For Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation; neither in these Days of the Gospel, shall they learn War any more, as they have done; but great will be the Joy and Triumph, of the Church of England: Great will be the Honour and Exaltation of our Royal Sove∣raign, His Majesty of Great Britain: And great will be the Peace and the Prosperity of many Kingdoms. So that in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, ma∣ny Nations will be freed from Slavery, and throughout the whole World there will be great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity: This I Declare, but not by my own Wisdom and Power, nor by the Wisdom and Power of any Mortal Men, but by the Wisdom and Power of the God of Heaven, who doth all things in Heaven, and in Earth; according to the Counsel of his own Will, and that when and by whom he will; that so all the Glory may Re∣dound to him, and that no Flesh should Glory be∣fore him. This great and mighty God, who is the Search∣er of all Hearts, and has the command over all Spi∣rits; who can speak Peace, when he please, and by whom he please, to a Person, or to a Nation, has stirr'd me up to Engage with him, and has given me Wisdom, Power, and Athority, from his Word and Spirit, for to understand his mind, and to make it known in due time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind. Had any one have promised to give me Ten
Thousand Pound, for to Engage in so Noble a De∣sign; I should not have Ventured my Life, Endan∣gered my Liberty, for to Engage in a Business of so High a Nature, that I have neither President, Ex∣ample, or Encouragement, from Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men; though it tends for the great Honour, Peace, and Prosperity of them: But ha∣ving an eye to the Recompence of Reward, which is the Crown of Life; that Crown which will never Rust, when all the Honour and Glory of this World, will be laid in the Dust: I have Ventured my Life, Endangered my Liberty; and have Ex∣posed my self to many Losses, Crosses, and Re∣proaches; to be Blam'd, Sham'd, and Condemn'd by many Men, for Engaging with the God of Hea∣ven, for to make known his mind, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind. But that God that has Encouraged me, and Assisted me in well doing, will Protect me and Reward me in due time for well doing. They that can deny them∣selves, and overcome themselves, for to lay out themselves for his sake and the Gospel, will in this World receive a Hundred-fold of Joy, Peace, and Comfort, and in the World to come Eternal Life; which they will want, that be afraid or a∣sham'd to own him, and to appear for him, in the worst of times, and before the best of Men: They that deny him before Men, he will them, before his Father and Holy Angels in Heaven: But they that Confess him here, he will them there: The time is come that the God of Heaven will not be Slighted and Mocked by the Sons of Men, as he has
been too long and too much by many of them; as by Unbelieving Jews, Bruitish Atheists, Wicked and Bloody Papists, and Rebellious Dssners and Sstaries: But as in these Gospel Days they wl not Know, Fear, Love, Serve, and Honour him, he will be Honoured upon them; in bringing of them to great Shame and Consusion, as many have sound, and more will find, if that they will not Cease to do Evil, and Learn to do well; but they that will Honour the God of Heaven, he has promised to Honour them, in this World, some∣times it may be with Honours, Riches, and a long Lise; but in Heaven it will be with all that have been Faithful and Fruitful, for the great Honour of God, the King and Nation, in their Generati∣on, in this Life, he will Reward them in Heaven, with Glory, Immortallity, and the Crown of Life. The Eyes of the Lord are upon the Righteous, both to behold them, and to uphold them, for his Eyes run too and fro throughout the whole Earth; to shew himself strong in the behalf of them, whose Heart is perfect towards him; to Assist them, to Counsel, Comfort, and Strengthen them, and to Defend them; and to Punish and Wound them that do Offend them, that do Slight and Undervalue them, that be as dear unto him, as the Apple of his Eye: They be his Peculiar Treasure, his Crown and Glory, his Portion, and his great Reward, though the Men of this World sees no Excellencies or Beau∣ty in them, yet by them that be most Wise, they be Counted Excellent Persons; for they be the Salt of
the Earth, the Light of the World, the City on a Hill; they be Men of great Ability, and Nobility; for Nobility, they have the Creator of Heaven and of Earth, to become their Reconciled Father, his only and beloved Sons, who is the Lord of Life, and the King of Glory, their Elder Brother; the Holy Ghost, their Counsellor, and Comsorter; Angels their Life-Guard, the best of Kings and Queens, their Royal Nurses, Ministers their Servants, and the Devil and all Wicked Men their Slaves: Do I say Ministers their Servants, are not all the Angels in Heaven, Ministring Spirits, sent forth to Mini∣ster for them, who are and shall be Heirs of Sal∣vation: So that great is the Honour of the Sons of the Most High, though they be Slighted and Under∣valued in this World by the Workers of Iniqui∣ty: Who can tell what great things the God of Heaven has laid up for them, whom he has provi∣ded so many to Honour and to Wait upon; some to Ennoble them, some to Counsel and Comfort them, some to Guard and Regard them, some to Provide and Nourish them, many to serve and to wait upon them. He that has given them his Son, who is the High and Mighty one, the Chiefest of Ten Thousands, will he not with him freely give them all things that shall be most suitable and seasonable, Profita∣ble, and Comfortable, and Advantageous for their Comfort in this Life, and their Happiness in a better. In this World, the Wisdom, the Power, the Ho∣nour, and the Glory of the Heirs of Heaven, the
Members of Christ; doth not well appear, because that their life is hid with Christ; but when he shall appear who will appear, with his Mighty An∣gels, and in his great Glory; then what will be∣come of them that know him not, and have not Obeyed his Gospel, they will be Punished with E∣verlasting Destruction, from the Presence of this great Lord, and from the Glory of his Power: But then he will be glorified in his Saints, and ad∣mired of all them that believe; for he will Change their Vile Bodies that have been upon Earth, and make them like unto his most Glorious Body, which is more Glorious than the Sun in the Firmament; to be for ever with him, in whose Presence is fulness of Joy, and at whose Right Hand are Pleasures for ever more in this World. A true Believer is a Man of Wonder, because he has the Devil and the World under his Feet, and Christ in his Heart, who is the Hope of Glory and the Crown of Glory, to them that Believe in him, and make an Improvement of him: And as a true Believer is a Man of Wonder many times to him∣self, so sometimes the God of Heaven will make him a Son of Thunder, against the Turk, the Pope, and the Devil, and all the Workers of Evil, against all that do Slight and Undervalue the Word of God, and Question his mighty Power. It is not Men, nor Angels, but the God of Heaven, that has made me a Wonder to my self, a Terror to his Enemies, and a Crown and a Glory to all them that be Faith∣ful to him, to our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, to the Protestant Religion, and to the Church of England.
The God of Heaven is no Respecter of Persons, he that loveth Truth, and worketh Righteousness, will be Accepted, and Rewarded; but all the Workers of Iniquity will be Ashamed, Confound∣ed, and Destroyed. He is not a Righteous Man, that is not a Hum∣ble and a Holy Man, a Wise and a Faithful Man, a Valourous and a Couragious Man, in his Gene∣ration, for the great Honour of God, the King and Nation. For Men to want these Graces, they will be found Unacceptable to the God of all Grace, Unprofitable to them that want Grace, and Un∣comfortable to themselves in every State and Con∣dition; but to have these Graces in Truth, and to produce their Fruit, will Procure and Secure Men in the Favour of the God of Heaven, and of the Wise and Mighty Angels in Heaven, and of all them that be faithful to the God of Heaven, to the Protestant Religion, and the Church of Eng∣land. Would Men be Wise, Strong, Rich, and Ho∣nourable Persons, most Excellent Persons, more Precious than Gold, or the Gold of Ophir; they must labour to get and to keep a Sound Heart, which is the Life of the Flesh; a Wholsom Tongue, which is a Tree of Life, and Righteous Lips, which are the Delight of Kings. He that Loveth Pure∣ness of Heart, for the Grace of his Lips, the King will be his Friend: The Heart of the Wise, teach∣eth his Mouth, and addeth Learning to his Lips: The Wise in Heart shall be called Prudent, and the Sweetness of the Lips Increaseth Learning: The
Wise shall Inherit Glory, but Shame will be the Pro∣motion of all them that do prefer the Pleasures of Sin, that lasts but for a Moment, above the Gain of Godliness, that lasts for Ever: Godliness it is great Gain, and will bring Men to great Fame, that be Faithful to the God of Heaven, to his Annointed our Royal and Gracious Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, to the Protestant Religion, and the Church of England. To Fear the God of Heaven, and to Honour the King, His Majesty of Great Britain, it is true Re∣ligion, which is taught in the Church of Eng∣land. There is no Place, Calling or Condition, that will Honour Men, if that they be not Careful to Honour God, and our Royal King in them: For what-ever Honours and Riches that Men do get, if that they do not Honour the God of Heaven, and His Maje∣sty of Great Britain, their Honours and their Riches will prove uncertain, and their Lives will prove uncomfortable: But if that Men will do that Worthy thing, as to know when, and how, for to Honour the God of Heaven, and our Royal So∣veraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, in this World, it will bring them to great Fame, and in Heaven with Holy Angels for ever to Remain. If there be Joy in Heaven at the Conversion of a Sinner, how much more ought there to be in the Church of England, when this Sinner shall bring forth the Fruits of Righteousness, for the Glory of the great and Mighty God, for the Credit of his Holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of
the Protestant Religion, and for the great Exaltation of His Majesty of Great Britain, which will bring great Joy and Triumph to the Church of England, and great Peace and Prosperity, to many King∣doms. They that would bring great Honour to the God of Heaven, and to His Majesty of Great Britain, must get a Sound Heart, and to get a Sound Heart, Men must Labour to get a Sound Faith, which is more Precious then Gold, and doth require more Wisdom, Power, and Skill to Prove it, Improve it; and to know when, and how for to Manage it, than it is to Sway a Scepter, and to Rule a King∣dom; and more Honour than it is to wear any Earthly Crown. This I declare, that no Subject whatsoever should Desire or Covet after the Growns and Scepters of Kings and Princes in this World; but if that Men will Covet after a Crown, let it be an Immortal one, which the Righteous Judge will give to all Faithful ones; for those that be Faithful to the Death, he will give the Crown of Life: That Crown which will never Rust, when all the Glory of this World, will be laid in the Dust. A Sound Faith is more Precious then Gold, or the Gold of Ophir, because it will purifie the Foul∣est Heart; it will in time make a mean Man Ho∣nourable, a Poor Man Rich, a Weak Man Strong, a Sick Man Well, and a Dying Man Happy; which all the things in this World cannot do: Divine Faith, which is more Precious than Gold, it is the Gift and Power of the great and mighty God, it is
not in the Power of any Mortal Men, to give it to their Nearest and their Dearest Friend: Parents cannot give it to their Children, nor Ministers to their People, but the Lord gives it when he will, and to whom he will, in the use of those Means, that he has appointed, and the Church of En∣gland has Ordained, and that is hearing the Word of God Preached. Divine Faith, which is more Pre∣cious then Gold, comes by Hearing, but not for Hearing: Hearing the Word of God is the Instru∣mental Cause, but our Saviour is the Original: Therefore he is worthy, for to have the Honour and the Glory of the Actings of every Mans Faith, because that he is both the Author and the Finish∣er of it: And though it is not in the Power of all the Ministers of the Gospel in London, or in En∣gland, to beget a Spark of Faith, where it is not, yet it ought to be their great care to take notice where it is wrought; and to Countenance and Encou∣rage that Person that has it for to bring it forth, because that it is such a Spark, that it will in time break forth into a Flame, for the Glory of Gods great Name; and to put the Turk, the Pope, and the Devil, and all the Workers of Evil, to Shame: and to bring His Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England, throughout the whole World, to great Honour, Renown, and Fame: And that without having a Sword in the Hand, of Men, or Money at Command; without making a Noise about Religion, without making of many Words, or having the Voice much heard: As Di∣vine Faith is a High and Honourable Grace, be∣cause
it is the Gift and Power of the Great and Mighty God; so it will Enable a Man for to pre∣pare High and Honourable Work, Pleasant, Profi∣table, and Delightsom Work, Victorious, Glorious, and Crowning Work, that will try the Wisdom, and the Skill, the Valour, and the Courage of many Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men, what they can do, and what they will do, in these Days of the Gospel, and in the Raign of our Royal Soveraign, for the great Honour and Renown of the Pro∣testant Religion, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, for the great Exaltati∣on of His Majesty of Great Britain, and for the great Peace, and Prosperity of many Kingdoms; that so many Nations may be freed from Slavery, and in the whole World, there may be great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity: Faith that is true, works by Love, and Love seeks not her own, but the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of many a one in Court, City, and Countrey. As the God of Heaven is a Wonder-working God, a Victorious, and a Glo∣rious God; so Divine Faith, which is more Preci∣ous than Gold, is a Wonder-working Grace, a Victorious, and a Glorious Grace: That Grace which will Enable a Man for to set a-work the Wisdom, and the Power, of the God of Heaven, will Enable him to set a Work the Wisdom, and the Power of Martial Men: Great are the Noble Acts Recorded in Holy Writ, that Gods Worthies have done by the Power of Faith, not by the Pow∣er of the Sword; by the Power of Faith, which is the Power of the God of Heaven: Men of Re∣nown
have Subdued Kingdoms, wrought Righte∣ousness, Obtained Promises, Stopped the Mouths of Lyons; out of Weakness were made Strong, have waxed Valiant in Fight, and turned many to Flight. Divine Faith, which is more Precious then Gold, will Enable a Man to be as bold as a Lion, strong∣er then Samson, and Wiser than the Devil, in the overcoming of Evil, and the doing of Good, in his Generation, for the great Honour of God, the King and Nation; but the want of so Excellent a Jewel as Divine Faith, which is a Supporting and a Comforting Grace, will make all the Workers of Iniquity throughout the whole World to Tremble, for all their Carnal Wisdom, Power, and Strength; it is not said, that a Man shall Overcome the World, by his Wisdom, Power, and Strength, but by his Faith, by Beleiving in the Son of God, and owning of him, and appearing for him. It is by Faith I stand, and by Faith that I do Understand, the Mind of the God of Heaven, what is to be done, among the Sons of Men, the Wisest and the Chief∣est among them, in these Days of the Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, for the great Honour and Ex∣altation, of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, and for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of many Kingdoms. To Write and to Speak the same thing again and again, it is needful, when it is Suitable and Sea∣sonable, Profitable, Comfortable, and Advanta∣geous
to a Person, a Family, a City, or a King∣dom. In these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, it will be known, who are Sons of the Church of England, and who are Sons for the Church of England; many may be Sons of the Church of England, that be a Burden and Re∣proach to the Church of England; but to be a Son for the Church of England doth Imply to seek the Good and Welfare of the Church of England, the Peace, and Settlement of the Church of England, the great Joy, and Triump of the Church of En∣gland, which will bring great Honour and Exalta∣tion to His Majesty of Great Britain, and great Peace and Prosperity to his Kingdoms. There is a Generation among the Sons of Men, that have a Name to Live, and are Dead, that be pure in their own Eyes, but yet not Cleansed from their Iniqui∣ties; these are too Wise for to say our Saviours Pray∣er and the Church of England's Prayer, because they have been so long Ruled by the Prince of the Air, who Rules in the Children of Disobedience, and is Active with them in all their Treasons: These have made the Church of England Black, with Reproaches cast upon her; but she is Comely in her Graces before the God of Heaven, and in her Carriage before Wise and Understanding Men; but before them that be more Nice then Wise, she is Despised in their Eyes. But in these Dayes of the Gospel, the Lord who is most Wise, and most Strong, will make it appear, who be for him or against him, and his Annointed our Royal and Gracious Soveraign.
The Lord whose Wisdom is unsearchable, and his Power unresistable; is a Wonder-working God, the Wonders that he has wrought for his Chil∣dren, when they have been Sould and Bought, is to be Admired and Remembred by all Persons, in all Nations. How was the Jews sold and bought to be destroyed by that wicked Haman and flat∣tering Courtier? But what did he get but shame and confusion, for he was taken in his own Net, did fall into his own Pit, and his violent Dealings came down upon his own Pate; for he was hang∣ed upon the same Gallows that he built for faith∣full and honourable Mordecai. What got the Spanish Aad, and the Gun-powder Traytors against Englands Royal Church and State? Were they not ashamed, confounded, and many destroy∣ed. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works unto the children of men. How many times has the Lord of Hosts saved and delivered England again and again, when that they have been sold and bought to have been destroyed, by the Pope, the French King, and the King of Spain: But the God of Heaven doth Night and Day watch over and de∣fend this Nation, to bring the Enemies of his Gospel to thame and desolation, that will not con∣form and reform to the Pretestant Religion, as it is Established in the Church of England. For a long time the Turk, the Pope, the French King, and the King of Spain have kept many Na∣tions in slavery for the Devil and their own lust: But the time is come, that in these days of the
Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign, will their Wisdom, their Power and Strength, their Honours and Riches, their great and high Places, be soon laid in the dust; but for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Re∣ligion, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, for the great Peace and Prospe∣rity of many Kingdoms, will His Majesty of Great Britains Crown and Kingdoms flourish among all Nations, while there is a Generation: So that the God of Heaven will bless the Earth with great encrease; and among all people in all Nations there will be a Free Trade, great Joy, and a last∣ing Peace. It becomes all the Ministers of the Gospel, all wise, strong, rich, and learned men, that will prove themselves faithful to the God of Heaven, to His Majesty of Great Britain, to the Protestant Re∣ligion, and to the Church of England, for to coun∣tenance and encourage this Noble Design, that Divine Wisdom and Power has enabled me for to make known in time, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of Mankind. Let the man be what he will, or whom he will, whom the great Great and the Mighty God doth stir up to engage with him, for to make known his Mind, for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, and the great Peace and Prosperity of many Nations; that Man ought to be minded and regarded by the Wise, Godly, and the Learned: because that his Work is high and honourable Work, pleasant, prositable and delightsom Work, and will prove
victorious, glorious and crowning Work; it will Crown the God of Heaven with much Glory a∣mong the Sons of Men, and our Royal Sovereign His Majesty of Great Britain with great Honour and Power over them, over all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes and Emperours in the world. That this may be done and well done, let all that do profess the Protestant Religion, that can pray, pray for the long life, and prosperous, and victorious Reign of our Royal Sovereign, his Ma∣jesty of Great Britain; that the Lord would en∣able him to be as Good as Great, and keep him at all times, and in all places, as the Apple of his own Eye; the Lord deliver him always out of the hands of unreasonable, bloody and deceitful men; for all men have not Faith that do profess it Let all pray that the Lord would by his wisdom and power, establish his Majesties Royal Throne in Righteousness; and enable his Royal Majesty to be a Terrour to all the Workers of Evil, and a Praise to them that do well. Let all pray that the God of Heaven and Earth would bless his Boyal Majesty with all temporal, spiritual and eternal Blessings; and when this mortal life of his shall be at an end, that the Lord, who is most great, and most good, would give him an everlasting Life, and a glorious and unmortal Crown in his own Kingdom: Let all that can pray, pray that the Lord would bless our Royal Sovereign in all his Royal Relations; th the word would en∣noble them to be true and fruitful Branches of the
most Royal Vine, that they may slourish in the Courts of Gods House, and bring forth such Fruits as will be most suitable and seasonable, pleasant, profitable and comfortable to themselves and o∣thers: Let all that can pray, pray that the Lord who is most wise, and most strong, would bless our Royal and Gracious Sovereign with wise and faithful Counsellours; that the Lord would coun∣sel them with his Holy Spirit, and enable them to be the Repairers of our Breaches, and the Re∣storers of our Paths to dwell in: It is the Blessing of the Lord that doth make rich, and it is his Bles∣sing that doth make weak and unlikely means ef∣fectual; but without his Blessing, neither Wis∣dom, Power, Strength or Counsel, can be suc∣cesful. Let all that can pray, pray that the Lord would bless our Royal Sovereign with a wise, godly and learned Clergy; the Reverend Bishops, and all the Ministers of Gods holy Word and Sa∣craments; the Lord make them more and more faithful unto him, to our Royal Sovereign  Ma∣jesty of Great Britain, to the  and to the Church of England: To this end, the Lord bestow a double portion of  upon them, and grant that they may  of their Labours, the salvation of many Souls, which will be the Joy of Angels, and a Crown to their Ministry. Let all that can pray pray that in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign, his Majesty of Great Bain, the Lord would bless all people in all Mations with truth of grace, strength of grace, and increase of
grace. Let all pray that can, that the Lord would raise up those that are fallen into the mire of Sin, and that he would be pleased to strengthen them that do stand in the good old way of Piety and Ho∣nesty, as it is taught in the Church of England. Let all pray, that in these days of the Gospel, the Lord would forgive our Enemies, Persecu∣tors, and Slanderers, and turn their hearts: That he would be pleased to have mercy upon all men, that so his Mercy, and Wisdom, and Power may be more and more known upon earth, and his sa∣ving health among all Nations; that so among all people there may be a general Reformation, which will bring great Joy, Peace and Consola∣tion; And to his Majesty of Great Britain, and to the Church of England great Honour and Exal∣tation. Let not any despise the day of small things, for what I have made known in much weakness and many infirmities, against much opposition and contradiction, I know that the God of Hea∣ven will raise it with great power, for the glory of his great Name, for the credit of his holy Go∣spel, for the great honour and renown of the Pro∣testant Religion, for the great joy and triumph of the Church of England, the great honour and exaltation of his Majesty of Great Britain, and the great peace and prosperity of many Kingdoms; which will be brought about in the days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign. Cryout and shout thou Inhabitant of Zion, thou Church of England, for great is the Holy One of Israel, in the midst of thee, to counsel, comfort and
to strengthen thee in thy troubles, and to bring thee to great honour and glory: So that all thy Enemies that have been incensed against thee, will be ashamed and confounded, if that they will not Conform and Reform to the Protestant Religion, as it is established in the Church of England, which is for Ʋnity, Peace and Concord the best; which would have all the Sons and the Daughters of Men to live in the fear of God, and to die in his favour; then they will not be afraid to die, nor asham'd to live: but their last works and days will be best. It is high and honourable work, pleasant, pro∣sitable and delightsom work; it is victorious and crowning-work: That the God of Heaven has stirr'd me up for to engage with him in this day of his power, for the glory of his great Name, for the credit of his holy Gospel, for the great honour and renown of the Protestant Religion; for the great joy and triumph of the Church of England, and the great peace and prosperity of many King∣doms. It is such work, that the French King with all his Men and Money has not done, cannot do, nor knows how to do: And why, because his Wis∣dom is Foolishness, and his Strength is Weakness to bring it about; his Wisdom and his Strength will deceive him, and all that trust to their carnal wisdom, power and strength in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign: Their wisdom is foolishness, and their strength is weakness, who are not careful to make themselves
strong in the Lord, in the Lord Jehovah, and in the power of his might. O great is the power of Faith, that doth in∣able a mortal man to know that his wisdom and strength is in the Immortal God, and to get wis∣dom and strength from him, to be useful and ser∣viceable for him in his Generation; for the great Honour of Him and the King; and the peace and prosperity of many Nations. O great is the power of Faith, that doth in∣able the Sons of Men to be most useful and service∣able both in Church and State; and that in the worst of times, and before the best of men. It is the power of Faith that doth inable the Sons of Men for to have power with the God of Heaven, to get power from him; and to act with Power, for the great Honour of him, and the King, and the great Peace, and Prosperity of his Kingdoms. What I have done, can do, or shall do, by the Pow∣er of Faith, which is the Power of God, in this Noble Design, which I have made known in time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Man∣kind; I would have all Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men, give all the Glory to the God of Heaven; because all Glory is due to him, both from Man and Angels: And that continually the Lord, who is most wise, and most strong, knows when an I how for to make bare his Arm, and to send forth his Light and Truth, to shame and con∣demn all unbelieving Jews, bruitish Athetsis, wicked and bloody Papists, and rebellious Dis∣sontors and Sectaries, that do style and underva∣lue
his Word of Truth, and will not believe in the God of Truth; but do live too many of them, as if there was no God that made them, and that there is not any that can save them. But as the Lord, who is most Great and most Good, is able and willing to save unto the utmost all that come unto him, be their sins never so great and many; so he will punish unto the uttermost all that will not come unto him in these days of the Gospel for salvation. Understand O ye Heathen, and ye believing Jews, and ye bruitish Atheists, and ye cked and blood-thirsty Papists, and ye rebellio Dissentors and Sectaries, when will ye learn to be wise, to fear, love, serve and to honour him, and to know him who gives unto all men their being: He that planted the ear, shall he not hear; he that formed the eye, shall he not see us? He knows that all things that are wrought in secret, will be made known in publick, for Light will discover Dark∣ness; and the Lord that made man, doth not only know all mens hearts, but all their thoughts, what they tend to, and what will be the end of them; The way of the wicked is as darkness, they know not at what they stumble; but the way of the Lord is strength to the upright, because he makes him his hop, his trust, his joy and delight. Let not any in these Gospel-days question whe∣ther there be a God that made the Heavens, the Earth and the Sea, and all things that in them be; because that he gives life, and breath, and being unto all the Sons of Men, and takes it away when
he please from any of them; the Lord will be known throughout the whole World to be God, by his Judgment upon the Wicked who, are his Rod, for to punish his Children that walk contra∣ry unto him: He that chastiseth the Heathen, shall not he correct? Yes, he will correct them whom he loves most, that they may serve him best. God had only one Son without sin, but not any with∣out suffering; our Saviour did learn obedience in the things he suffered: not as he was God, there could be no obedience desired or required of him; but as he was man, in taking upon him our Na∣ture he learned Obedience; for he took upon him the form of a servant, and made himself of no reputation, for to bring the Sons and the Daughters of Men that do believe in him, to great honour and exaltation. Our Nature, it was his great humiliation, that the Son of God should be∣come the Son of Man; it is the highest mystery and the greatest humility. But why was this done? That so the Sons of Men might become the Sons of God, and Children of the Most High: And if children, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Christ: Which priviledge, it is so high, that though the Angels in Heaven do continually admire it, they will never enjoy it; for our Saviour did not take up∣on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of A∣braham: For God so loved the world, that he gave his onely beloved Son, that whosoever believed in him should not perish but have everlasting life. To this end he obeyed his Fathers will, and for
his love to the Sons of Men, he humbled himself to advance them; he became poor, to make them rich; he under-went his Fathers Frowns, that they might enjoy his Smiles: he became a Curse, that they might enjoy the Blessing; he did wear the Crown of Thorns, that they might wear the Crown of Glory: he died a shameful and a pain∣ful death, that they might enjoy a happy and a blessed Life. And has he done so much for the Sons of Men, let not any of them think any thing too much to do for him; but let them all be willing to be any thing, to be nothing, so he may be all: Let him rule in them and over them, who can best counsel, and comfort, and strengthen them, ho∣nour, protect, and reward them: The Angels in Heaven rejoyce and praise God for his love to the Sons of Men, in finding out a Ransom for them; but the fallen Angels have not any to pity them, but they be reserved in Chains of Darkness to the Judgment of the Great day; And then all must give Account what they have done in this World, whether it be good or evil. The good Angels rejoyce and proclaim Glory to God in the Highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men: But no Worship or Adoration is due to them, much less to pray to Saints Deceased. We are to praise God for the benefit and the com∣fort we have from Angels and good Men, and from any of his Creatures. Let all the Sons and the Daughters of Men therefore praise the Lord Day by Day, for Right∣hand
Mercies, for Left-hand, for Temporal, Spi∣ritual, and Eternal: But above all, for Jesus Christ the Foundation and the Fountain of them all. Let them praise him every Day for their Crea∣tion in due time, for their Redemption in the ful∣ness of time, and their Preservation time after time. Let them praise him for the Means of Vo∣cation, Justification, Sanctification, and for hopes of Glorification. In these Days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign, too many that have made Separation from the Church of England, have proved wandring Stars, and then blazing Stars, and at last falling Stars. How has many of them boasted of Church Priviledges, of Gospel Ordi∣nances, of strong Assurance, and of great Revela∣tion; and of a sudden, like a Morning-cloud, have vanished away, and come to nothing: But the path of the Just is as the shining-light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect Day. The Church of England has her fixed and real Stars, which unbelieving Jews, bruitish Atheists, wicked and bloody Papists, and rebellious Dissentors and Se∣ctaries, and know not well where they are, nor who they are; but they are known to the Most High, and from him they will give the greatest and the clearest Light in the darkest Night of trou∣ble and affliction that doth befall many Persons, and many Nations. Husbandmen love to see and to enjoy Fruit∣ful Fields, Fruitful Vineyards, and Fruitful Gar∣dens: And the God of Heaven loves that they
that know him, and do own him, should be Fruit∣ful in Good Works; for herein is he much glorifi∣ed, that the Sons and the Daughters of Men should bring forth much Fruit, such Fruit as is suitable and seasonable, profitable and comfortable in their Generation, for the great honour of God, the King and Nation. As the Apple-tree among the Trees of the Wood, so be they that be Fruitful among the Sons of Men: They may be black with Reproaches cast upon them, but they be comely with good Gra∣ces wrought in them. Every true Member of Christ is a Garden inclo∣sed, a Spring shut up, a Fountain sealed from the world; but it is in the World. The men of the World will condemn many that do profess Reli∣gion, for they love their own, and will not quar∣rel, contend, and slight one another so much as they that be for this Party, and that Party; for this Opinion and that Opinion, and all against the Church of England. It has been want of love to God and to Fellow-members, that has caused so much Strife and Contention, Sedition and Rebel∣lion for about Fourty years; that it has been on∣ly the Lords mercy that we have not been con∣founded, nor consumed long before now: But shall we still provoke the Lord to anger, who is most Great and most good; will he not provoke us to anger, even to the shame and confusion of our own Faces, if that we will not Conform and Reform to him, and to the Government of the Church of England. Has not the Church of England Ene∣mies
enough from the Church of Rome to Encoun∣ter withal? But must she be slighted and underva∣lued, vexed and perplexed by them that should readily and willingly assist her, but not in the least resist her? What ever Wisdom, Power, Courage, or any Grace any Member has received in the Church of England, they ought to prove it, and improve it, and to know when and how for to manifest it, for the great peace and prosperity of the Church of England; and not to make a noise about Religion: to be the Head of this Party, or that Society, that is divided from the Church of England: This is that which makes Mutiny and Confusion, it argues too much self-seeking, and will prove unto many self-undoing. As all the Members of the natural Body act for the good of that Body; so all the Members of the Church of England ought for to act for the great Honour, Peace and Prosperity of the Church of England; or else they be not for her, but against her. The mighty God, who is most Great and most Good, will plead thy Cause O Church of England; therefore let the Tuk, the Pope and the Devil, and all the Workers of evil, combine and design to undermine and overthrow the Church of England, they will be deceived, confounded, and for ever ashamed. The Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back? Is not destructi∣on to the wicked, and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? Therefore let not any Envy or Fret at the prosperity of the Wicked; but ra∣ther
let them be pitied: For if that they do not bring forth good Fruit in due season, they will soon be cut down like the Grass, and wither as the green Herb: But the Salvation of the Righte∣ous is of the Lord, he is their Strength in the time of trouble, he will help, save, and deliver them, because they trust in him; but the Transgressours will be destroyed together, the end of the Wicked is to be cut off; the Lord of Hosts hath broken the Staff of the Wicked, and the Scepter of the Rulers: For Babylon the Glory of Kingdoms, the Beauty of the Chaldees Excellency, will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, Son of the Morning! How art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the Nations! The Lord of Hosts will rise up against Babylon, and cut off from them what he has promised, the Name and Remnant, and Son and Nephew, saith the Lord. He who smote the people in wrath with a con∣tinual Stroke; He that ruled the Nations in an∣ger, is persecuted, and none hindreth. Then this Proverb will be taken up against the King of Ba∣bylon, and many will say, How hath the Oppres∣sor ceased, the golden City ceased; that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the Cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners: Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming; it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath rai∣sed up from their thrones all the kings of the Na∣tions; all they shall speak and say unto thee, Art
thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us? thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy Viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee; for thou hast said in thy heart, thou wilt ascend into heaven, thou wilt exalt thy throne above the stars of God, thou wouldst ascend above the heights of the clouds; thou wouldst be like the most high: Yet thou shelt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit; they that see thee, they shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the world to tremble, that did shake kingdoms? The Lord of Hosts, who is most wise, and most strong, will punish the World for their Evil, and the Wicked for their Iniquities: He will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the Terrible. And when the Lord hath performed his whose Work upon Mount Sion, and on Jerusalem, he will then punish the stout heart of the King of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. Shall the Axe boast it self against him that heweth therewith? Or shall the Saw magnifie it self against him that shaketh it: As if the Rod should shake it self against them that lift it up: Or as if the Staff should hit up it self as if it were no wood. Cannot the Potter do with the Clay as he please? As the Clay is in the hands of the Potter, so are all men in all Nations in the hands of the Lord of Hosts, to rule and over-rule them at his will and pleasure: Therefore let all the Inhabitants of the World fear him, let them
tremble at his presence; who has placed the Sand for the bound of the Sea, by a perpetual Decree, that it cannot pass it, though the Waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it. And shall the Workers of Iniquity, the Seed of evil Doers, the Children of Disobedience, the Enemies of the Gospel, rage and fret, and combine and design to undermine and overthrow the Workers of Righ∣teousness; those that be faithful to the Protestant Religion, and to his Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England; but it will tend to their own shame and confusion? For the Righte∣ous will slourish, but Destruction will be to the Workers of Iniquity; though they may make a Covenant and Agreement with Death and with Hell, when the over-flowing Scourge shall pass thorow, that it may not come unto them; but they will be deceived, because they have made Lyes their Refuge, therefore their Covenant with Death shall be disanulled, and their Agreement with Hell shall not stand: When the over-slowing Scourge shall pass thorow, then they shall be trodden down by it: From the time that it goeth forth it shall take them, for morning by morning will it pass over by day and by night: And it will be a vexation unto the Workers of Iniquity, the Enemies of the Protestant Religion, and of the Church of England, only to understand the Report thereof. Let not any be Mockers and Scoffers, and say, Where is the Promise of his coming? least their Bands be made strong; for behold the Lord,
who is most wise and most strong, most gracious, and most glorious; who has been for a long time much provoked, being slighted and undervalued by unbelieving Jews, bruitish Atheists, wicked, bloody, and deceitful Papists, and rebellious Dis∣sentors and Sectaries: He cometh out of his place to punish the Inhabitants of the Earth, for their Iniquity; for though the Lord, who is most great, has his Throne in the highest Heavens, yet when he pleases, for his peoples ease, he can come into the lowest heart; for to make the Enemies of his Gospel throughout the whole World to smart: therefore Fear, and the Pit, and the Snare, are upon thee, O Inhabitant of the Earth: It shall come to pass that he who sleeth from the noise of the Fear, shall fall into the Pit, and he that cometh out of the midst of the Pit shall be taken in the Snare, when he ariseth to shake terribly the Earth: Therefore let all that be wise of heart, that would be secure, enter into the Rock of Ages for safety; let them humble themselves for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his most Excellent Majesty; for the losty looks of men will be humbled, and their haughtiness bowed down; for the Lord thy God, O Church of England, will be exalted in the hearts of men, for his wonderful works and great mercy towards them: But they that have not made the Lord of Hosts, in these days of the Gospel, their strong Hold and City of Refuge; what will they do in the Day of Visitation, and in the Desolation which shall come from far? To whom will they slee for help? And where will
they leave their Glory? Who will in such a day as this is plead for Baal, for Idol-worship? Or, who will undertake to uphold Babylon? Babylon is fallen by Gods Decree, who doth fore-see how all things will be. The time is come, that Baby∣lon shall fall suddenly, and all the graven Images of her Gods, and the Idols will be utterly abo∣lisht: They that will plead for Baal, let them be put to death; if he be a God, let him plead for himself. What saith the Lord, who is the true and the ever-living God, who is to be feared and served by all people in all Nations. Learn not the way of the Heathens, and be not dismayed at the Signs of the Heavens; for the Heathens are dismayed at them: For the Customs of bruitish Atheists and foolish Papists is vain; for one cutteth a Tree out of the Forest, the work of the hands of the Work∣man with the Ax; they deck it with Silver and with Gold, they fasten it with Nails and with Hammers that it move not, they are upright as the Palm-tree, but speak not; they must needs be born because they cannot go: therefore let not any be afraid of them, for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good; they have Mouths but they speak not, Eyes have they, but they see not; they have Hands, but they handlenot; Feet have they, but they walk not, neither speak they through their Throat: They that make them are like unto them, so is every one that trusteth in them. But let them that fear the true & ever-living God, trust in him, and he will be their Help and their Shield; he will encourage them in well-do∣ing,
and reward them for well doing, both in this World, and in a better: But the Workers of Ini∣quity, and Seed of Evil Doers, the Children of Disobedience are Confounded, by their Graven I∣mages; for their Molten Image is Falshood, and there is no Breath in them: They are Vanity, and the Work of Errours, in the time of their Visita∣tion they shall perish, the Portion of Jacob is not like them, for he is the Former of all things, and Israel is the Rod of his Inheritance; the Lord of Hosts is his Name. The Lord of Hosts hath his Bat∣tel Axes and Weapons of War, whereby he can, when he pleases, and with whom he pleases in the day of his Power break in Pieces the Nations, and destroy Kingdoms; break in Pieces the Horse and his Rider, and the Chariot and his Rider: The Lord has broke in Pieces both Man and Woman, both Old and Young; he has broke in Pieces both the Shepherd and his Flock, the Husbandman and his Yoke of Oxen, both Captains and Rulers, the Lord has done it and will do it: They that walk contrary unto him, that will not Labour to Know him, so as to Fear, Love, Serve, and to Honour him, he will walk contrary unto them, so as to Wound them and Confound them. Put your selves in Array against Babylon, all you Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men, that be Faithsul to the God of Heaven, to his Annoin∣ted our Royal and Gracious Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, to the Protestant Religion, and to the Church of England: Put your selves in Array against her round about, all ye that bend the
Bow, or handle the Sword, shout at her, spare no Arrows, for she hath sinned against the Lord thy God, O Church of England; who is most great and most good, most gracious, and most glori∣ous: Shout against her round about, for it is the vengeance of the Lord, who is most wise, and most strong; therefore take vengeance upon her: As she hath done, do unto her; set ye up a Standard in the Land, blow the Trumpet among the Na∣tions; prepare the Nations against her, call to∣gether against her the Kingdoms; appoint a Cap∣tain against her; prepare against her the Nations, with the Kings of the Medes, the Captains thereof, and all the Rulers thereof, and all the Land of his dominion: The Land shall tremble and sorrow, for every purpose of the Lord thy God, O Church of England, will be performed against Babylon, to make the Land of Babylon a Desolation without an Inhabitant. In these days of the Gospel many will see it and be glad, and rejoyce; the mighty men of Babylon will forbear to sight, because it is the vengeance of the Lord, the vengeance of his Temple: Babylon, which is the Church of Rome, hath been a golden Cup, that has made all the Earth drunken, the Nations have drunken of her Wine, therefore the Nations are mad. You that do truly fear and love the true God, flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his Soul, that they may not be cut off in her Iniquity; for this is the time of the Lords vengeance, who will render unto her a Recompence; for her Judgment reacheth unto Heaven, and is listed up even unto
the Skies; therefore the Lord whom thou hast mocked and provoked with thy Images and I∣dols, have laid a Snare for thee, O Babylon, to be taken and destroyed, because thou hast striven against him who is most wise, and most strong; who will render unto Babylon, and to all her In∣habitants, all the evil that they have done in Zi∣on, in the Church of Christ throughout the whole World: Therefore will thy young men, O Ba∣bylon, fall in the Streets, all thy Men of War will be cut off in this day of the Lords power, and the most proud will stumble and fall, and not any will be able to raise them up. The Lord of Hosts is against thee, O Babylon, O Church of Rome, whose Day is come when Iniquity shall have an end: What saith the Lord, whose Word will stand and prevail, when the Church of Rome, and the Pope of Rome's Pride and Vain Glory will soon fail. Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the Dia∣dem, and take off the Crown, for the Pope of Rome must come down, and all that will under∣take to uphold his Crown: Exalt him that is low, our Royal Soveraign his Majesty of Great Britain, who has been a King of many Sorrows and Cares; but the time is come, that our Royal Sovereign is to be a King of more Joys and less Fears than any of his Majesties Predecessors have enjoyed before him; and it will be well that his Majesties Successors may enjoy the like after him. As the Lord will exalt them that be low, that be meek and humble, so he will abase them that be high, who are proud and stubborn, that have high
thoughts of themselves, and low thoughts of him. Is it not the Turk, the Pope, and the French King? But they will know, that the Most High is above them, and has the greatest power to set up and to pull down when he will, and whom he will; therefore Babylon, the Church of Rome, will be∣come heaps, a dwelling-place for Dragons, an a∣stonishment and an hissing, without an Inhabitant. What saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the Daughter of Babylon, that she is like a Threshing-floor, it is time to thresh her, for the time of her Harvest shall come, and will not tarry. The Lord will give great joy, rest and peace unto thee, O England, Scotland, France and Ire∣land, and unto all those Nations that do profess and enjoy the Protestant Religion; but he will disquiet all the Inhabitants of Babylon, all that be in league or in love with the Church of Rome, where ever they be, or where-ever they are. A Sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, who is most wise, and most strong, and has all power and powers in his own hand; and upon the In∣habitants of Babylon, and upon her Princes, and upon her Wise-men: A Sword is upon the Lyars, and they shall dote; a Sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed: A Sword is up∣on their Horses, and upon their Chariots, and up∣on all the mingled people that are in the midst of thee, O Babylon, and they shall become as Wo∣men: A Sword is upon her Treasures, and they shall be robbed: A Drought is upon her Waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is the Land of
graven Images, and they are mad upon their I∣dols: but the time is come, that the Lord will do Judgment upon the graven Images of Ba∣bylon, and her whole Land will be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her; for the Lord will punish Bell in Babylon, and will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up; And the Nations shall not slow together any more unto him; yea the Wall of Ba∣bylon shall fall, as God overthrew Sodom and Go∣morrah, and the Neighbour Cities thereof, saith the Lord; so that no man shall abide there, nei∣ther shall any Son of man dwell therein, but the wild Beasts of the Islands shall dwell there, and the Owls shall dwell therein; but it shall be no more inhabited for ever, neither shall it be dwelt in from Generation to Generation: Then the Hea∣ven and the Earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon; for the Spoilers shall come unto her from the North, saith the Lord, who is slow to anger, but he is great in power; and that Ba∣bylon the Church of Rome will know to her great shame and overthrow: Though Babylon should mount up to Heaven, and though she should for∣risie the height of her strength; yet she shall fall and never rise more. Wo be to them that go down to Egppt for help, and stay on Horses, and trust in Chariots, because they be many, and in Horsemen because they be very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek unto him who is the Lord of Hosts, strong and mighty in Battel, who can and will help and deliver them
that trust in him, when all outward means fail. There is no King saved by the multitude of an Host; a mighty man is not delivered by much Strength: An Horse is a vain thing for safety, nei∣ther can he deliver any by his great Strength. The Egyptians are Men and not God, and their Horses Flesh and not Spirit; therefore they that trust unto them, when the Lord shall stretch out his Hand, and make bare his Arm, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen, shall fall down, and they all shall faise toge∣ther; therefore wo be to the rebellious Chil∣dren, all unbelieving Jews, bruitish Atheists, wicked, bloody and deceitful Papists, and all proud Dissentors and Sectaries; that take Coun∣sel, but not of the Lord, who is most wise, and most strong; and that cover with a Covering, but not of his Spirit, that so they may add sin to sin. Wo unto them that be wise in their own Eyes, and that seek Deep to hide their Counsel from the Lord, before whom the Darkness and the Light are both alike; and yet they say, Who see∣eth them, and who knoweth them? Understand O ye bruitish Atheists, and ye Fools, when will ye be wise? He that teacheth Man knowledge, shall not he know? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of Wise-men, that they be vanity, that all People in all Nations may know the true God, whose Do∣minion it is from Sea to Sea, and from one end of the World to the other: He will proceed to do a marvellous Work and a Wonder; he that gives Understanding to the simple, doth many times
cause the Wisdom of Wise-men to perish, and the Understanding of the Prudent to be hid. He turneth wise Men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish; he leadeth Councellors away spoiled, and maketh the Judges Fools; he looseth the Bond of Kings, and girdeth their Loins with a Girdle: He leadeth Princes away spoiled, and over-throweth the mighty; he removeth away the Speech of the Trusty, and taketh away the Understanding of the Aged: He putteth down the Mighty from their Seat, and doth many times exalt the Humble and the Meek. He giveth Power to the Faint, and to them that have no Might: He increaseth Strength; he discovereth deep things out of Darkness, and bringeth out to Light the shadow of Death: He increaseth the Nations and destroyeth them: He enlargeth the Nations, and straiteneth them again: He taketh away the Heart of the Chief of the People of the Earth, and causeth them to wander many times in a Wilderness where there is no way: They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man. He break∣eth down, and it cannot be built. Again, He shutteth up a Man, and there can be no opening. He with holdeth the Waters, and they dry up also: He sendeth them out and they overturn the Earth when he pleases. With him is Wisdom and Strength; the Deceived and the Deceiver are his: If he cut off and shut up, or gather together, who can hinder him. He sitteth upon the Circle of the Earth, and all the Inhabitants before him
are as Grashopers. He stretcheth out the Heavens as a Curtain, and spreadeth them out as a Tent to dwell in. Therefore let all the Sons and Daughters of Men learn to know, fear, love, serve, and to honour this great and mighty God, whose Wis∣dom is unsearchable, whose Power is unresistable, whose Goodness unexpressible, and whose Love is unchangeable; and according to his Power, so will his Anger and his Wrath be, against the seed of evil doers, and the workers of Iniquity. Who can or will say that there is not a God that made the World and don't govern the World? Have ye not known? Have ye not heard? Hath it not been told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood from the Foundations of the Earth, that the Everlasting God, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? There is no searching of his Understanding, even the Youth shall faint and be weary, and the Young men shall utterly fall; but they that wait upon the Lord will renew their Strength: they will mount up with Wings as Eagles, they will run and not be weary, and walk and not faint. Let who will glory in their Wisdom, Pow∣er, and Strength, in their Honours, Riches, great and high Places; I will glory in my Weak∣ness and Infirmities, and in my Insufficiency; that I that have nothing, comparatively, and am nothing seemingly, yet from Gods All-sufficiency I have Wisdom, Power and Strength for to un∣derstand
his Mind, for to make it known in due time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind, in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign, his Majesty of Great Britain: Who will rise up for me a∣gainst Evil Doers? Or who will stand up for me against the workers of Iniquity? Unless the Lord, who is most Great and most Good, had been my help, my Soul before now had dwelt in Silence; but the Lord of Hosts has been with me, and is with me as a mighty terrible One. Therefore they that be incensed against me for engaging with him, for the glory of his great Name, for the Credit of his Holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Pro∣testant Religion, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, for the great Exal∣tation of his Majesty of Great Britain, and the great Peace and Prosperity of many Kingdoms: they will be ashamed, if not confounded. Let all praise him for their Wisdom, their Power, their Honours, their Riches, their Great and High Places: Let all praise him daily for their Health, their Strength, their Liberty; for their Food, their Rayment, their Habitation; and for the Peace and Prosperity of their Friends and Relations; yea, of their very Enemies: And praise him for all Losses, Crosses and Reproaches, for they will work for the good of them that love God; for God had great love to the Sons of Men, when they were Enemies unto him. To this end the most Wise God, who is the
God of Love and Peace, has sent and continued from Generation to Generation his Gospel, which is the glad Tydings of Salvation: That so a∣mong the Sons of Men and the God of Heaven, there might be a great and a lasting Reconcili∣ation. God is Love, he that dwelleth in Love dwel∣leth in God, and God in him: He that loveth not his Brother whom he hath seen; how can he love God whom he hath not seen? It is Love to the God of Heaven, and to the Sons of Men, that has enabled me to deny my self, to overcome my self, and to lay out my self in so noble a Design; as for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind; as for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Re∣ligion; for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England; for the great Exaltation of our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Bri∣tain; and for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperi∣ty of many Kingdoms. They that will be willing to engage their Heart, Soul, Strength, Will and Affection, in the Service of God, he will give them Wisdom, Power, and Strength to make them able. As the Lord doth by his own Wisdom and Power rule, and over-rule all Nations as one Man; so he can with the same Wisdom and Power, with one Man, when he please to make bare his Arm; for his Arm is very long and very strong, and that his Enemies will know; the Turk, the Pope, and the Devil, and all the workers of E∣vil,
to their great shame and overthrow; and that in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain. The Lord thy God, O Church of England Reigneth, be the People never so Impatient, he whose Dominion it is from Sea to Sea, and from one end of the World to the other. Therefore let the Righteous rejoyce and be glad and shout for joy of heart; but all the workers of Iniquity, the seed of Evil Doers, the Children of Disobe∣dience, will be ashamed and confounded, if that they will not Conform and Reform to the Pro∣testant Religion, as it is Establisht in the Church of England, when the Lord, who is most Great and most Good, doth inable a Mortal Man for to understand his Mind, to have done what is remarkable; he will inable him to make it known in due time, that it may be recordable. Wise Men lay up Knowledge till a fit time; and he that hath Knowledge spareth his Words till a fit season; and a Man of Understanding is of an excellent Spirit; that knows what, when, and how that may be done, which tends for the great Honour, Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of a King and Kingdom. How much better is it therefore to get Wis∣dom rather than Gold, and Understanding above choice Silver; because it will give unto them that do imbrace it, an Ornament of Grace, and a Crown of Glory. How forcible are right Words, but what doth Arguing reprove, to contend for
this Opinion and that Opinion: It has been a great shame to the Protestant Religion and the Church of England. They that believe will be saved, but they that will not labour and en∣deavour to believe in the Son of God, who be∣came the Son of Man, will be ashamed, con∣founded, and at last destroyed: For there is no other remedy for Mans Recovery but by obeying the Gospel. Therefore consider what so great a Prince as the Lord of Life, and the King of Glory, has done for the Sons of Men: Let all fall in love with him; for if Unbelieving Jews and Bruitish Atheists, and Wicked and Bloody Papists, and Rebellious Dissentors and Sectaries, do not en∣deavour to love him, who is altogether lovely, their condition is sad for the present, and worse for the future; but I hope that in these Gospel-days, and in the Reign of our Royal Severaign, his Majesty of Great Britain; that Jews and Gentiles will come into one Fold; and that all People in all Nations, will know the True God, and Jesus Christ, so as to love, serve, and to honour him: For the Lord has promised, and he will make it good; for to give unto his Son the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utter∣most Parts of the Farth for his Possession. And who knows but that the time is come, that in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign, his Majesty of Great Britain, it is to be done: This high and honourable work, this pleasant, profitable, and long desired
work, this victorious, glorious, and crowning work, that will crown the God of Heaven with much glory among the Sons of Men, and his Ma∣jesty of Great Britain, with great Honour and Power over them, over all Heathen Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World, that will not submit to the Gospel and the Protestant Religion, as it is taught in the Church of Eng∣land: That this high and honourable work may be brought about by the Lords Annointed, his Majesty of Great Britain; the God of Heaven has stirr'd me up in time to make known his Mind, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Man∣kind: Therefore let the Righteous rejoyce, all that be faithful to the God of Heaven, to his Majesty of Great Britain, to the Protestant Re∣ligion, and to the Church of England; but let the Wicked tremble, and all the workers of Ini∣quity be ashamed; for in his Majesties Reign will the Righteous flourish, and in his days there will be abundance of Peace; so that Strife, Conten∣tion and Wars, in these Gospel-days will cease, and throughout the whole World among all Peo∣ple there will be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace: Therefore let the Heavens re∣joyce, and let the Earth be glad; let the Sea roar and the fulness thereof; let the Fields be joyful, and all that is therein; then shall all the Trees of the Wood rejoyce, for the Lord who is most wise and most strong cometh, he cometh to judge the Earth: He will judge the World with Righteousness, and the People with his
Arise and shine thou Church of England, thy Light is come, the Glory of the Lord is risen upon thee, to bring thee to great Honour and Exaltation; and the Whore of Babylon, the Man of Sin, and the Church of Rome, to great Shame and Desolation for her Idolatry and Abo∣mination, for her Lies and Fornication, for the Blood of the Saints that she has slain: Her time is come to be brought down with shame, but the Lord will have mercy upon Sion, upon his Church throughout the whole World; the time to favour her is come, so that great will be the Joy and Triumph of the Church of England; great will be the Exaltation of his Majesty of Great Britain, and great will be the Peace and and Prosperity of many Kingdoms. Let not any despise the day of small things, for that God that speaks peace to a Person, can inable a Person to make known his Mind, for the great joy, peace, and prosperity of many Nations. Return, Return, O backsliding Children therefore, and remember from whence you are fallen, and do your first work; for it was better with you than them: Even since the Dissentors and Secta∣ries, left off to be wise and to do good; they have been the occasion of shedding too much Blood: They left off to be wise, when they made Separation, which has caused Division, Con∣tention, Sedition and Rebellion: They left off do∣ing of much good, ever since, they have refused to say the daily Prayers of the Church of England, which Prayers are suitable and seasonable, pro∣fitable
and comfortable for all Persons in all Nations; they tend very much to inform the Ignorant, to Reform the Disobedient, to Com∣fort the Weak Christian, to Resolve the Doubt∣ing, to Raise up those that be fallen, and to Strengthen them that do Stand, if they be but well used and practiced; but these Prayers have been slighted and undervalued by them who are too much like many of the Children of Israel, who was a proud, froward, and stubborn Ge∣neration; Children that could talk of Faith, but the Lord told them, They had not Faith; for they moved him to Jealousie with that which is not god, they provoked him to Anger with their Vanities: But what saith the Lord, who has all power in his own hand, and the whole Creation at command; he told them that he would move them to Jealousie, with those which are not a People; he would provoke them to Anger with a foolish Nation. And has not our Contentions and Divisions about Religion caused the Lord to afflict us and to scourge us, with a foolish and ignorant People, even the Papist? They that provoke the Lord to Anger, he will provoke them to the shame and confusion of their own Faces. The Children of Israel did so far provoke to Anger the Lord, who is not easily provoked, that he did hide his Face from them, and would see what their end would be: And has not the Lord justly hid his Face from the Dissentors and Sectaries for a long time, to see what their
end will be: How they will quit themselves like Men. They can talk like Men and walk like Men, but they have acted, too many of them, like Children, Fools, and Mad-men; but their own wickedness will correct them, and their backsliding will reprove them: for the Backsliders in heart will be filled with their own foolish ways, they will lie down in sorrow. And have not the Dissen∣tors and Sectaries, experience enough, that have made Separation from the Church of England, what it is to backslide from the Worship of God, from the Word of God, from the Prayers of the Church, which tends to Edification, Reformation, and Consolation; and from the ways of God, whose ways are ways of Pleasantness, and all his Paths Peace; and from the Yoke of Christ, whose Yoke is easie and his Burden Light. And what have they got unto themselves, but great Shame and much Confusion? When Israel did cast off the thing that was good, the Enemy did pursue them. So since the Dissentors and Sectaries have cast off the good Prayers of the Church of England, which are profitable and comfortable; the God of Heaven has made their Friends as Enemies to pursue them: For if a mans ways please the Lord, he will make their Enemies to be at peace with them or with him, but if they do not, God will make their Friends their Ene∣mies; nay, the great and good God, who is the best Friend, will become unto them that do pro∣voke him, the worst Enemy. They that walk contrary unto him, he will
walk contrary unto them, and will punish them seven times more; he will heap mischief among them, and spend his Arrows upon them. And who will have pity upon thee or bemoan thee? Art thou not gone backward, O Dissentor, since thou hast broken thy Covenant with the Lord, in not endeavouring to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace? And have not you broken your Covenant with Men, O Rebellious Sectaries, in taking away the Life of our late Royal and Gracious Soveraign; therefore the Lord hath framed Evil against you, and devised a Device against you. Unless that you do return every one of you from your Evil Ways, and make your Ways and your Doings good, the Lord will bring an everlasting Reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which will not be for∣gotten: Nay, the Lord will make you Sick in smiting you, in making you desolate, because of your sins, if you will not turn unto him, in conforming to the Government of the Church of England: But I shall pray for the Dissentors and Sectaries, as the Apostle St. Peter prayed for Simon, That they would repent of their Wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thoughts of their hearts may be forgiven them: For I am affraid that too many of them may be in the Gall of Bitter∣ness, and in the Bond of Iniquity; for not keep∣ing the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace: but the Lord give them true Repentance, which will take off the greatest stain, and bring the Soul into the Favour of God. Again, Have not the
Dissentors and the Sectaries, by their falling from the Church of England? Have they not weakened her and grieved her? Have they not reproached and persecuted her both with their Tongues and their Hands? Have they not encouraged and strengthened the Papists against her, who are un∣reasonable, bloody, and deceitful men? But the Church of England, according to our Saviours Counsel, prays for her Enemies, Persecutors, and Slanderers, that the Lord would turn their hearts and have mercy upon all Men; that the Lord would be pleased to give to all Nations, Unity, Peace, and Concord; that the Lord would give us all Hearts to love and dread him, and to live after his Commandments. And if this had been done, the Dissentors and the Sectaries would not have fallen from God to displease him, and grieve one another, as they have done; but they can condemn all but themselves; but the God of Heaven has stirr'd me up for to reprove, rebuke, and to condemn them, that they may condemn themselves, for slighting the Prayers of the Church of England, and trusting to Prayers of their own making and framing, which are too many of them, neither agreeable to the Word of God, nor made by the Spirit of God; as the Prayers of the Church of England are: they be suitable for all Persons, for all Times, and all Conditions; they be such Prayers that the God of Heaven hath heard and answered, and doth hear and will answer them that put them up to him in a right man∣ner,
and to a right end. For the hearing and reading the holy Word of God, will not profit any, unless they do mixt it with Faith; no more will the Prayers of the Church of England. This is the excellency of these Prayers, that they are not so plain as profitable and comfortable; for all both high and low, rich and poor, and young and old. Were they but well put in practice, they would soon inform and reform the World, that lies and lives in ignorance and disobedience: From all evil and mischief, from sin, from the crafts and assaults of the Devil, from everlasting wrath and damnation, it becomes all wise men to pray that the good Lord would deliver them. Never more crafts and assaults of the Devil, never evil more and mischief done and committed, than by too many of them that have slighted, undervalued, and scorned these Prayers: From all blindness of heart, from pride, vain-glory, and hypocrisie; from envy, hatred, and malice, and all uncharitablness, it becomes all the Sons and the Daughters of Men that would be good, and do good, to pray that the good Lord would deliver them from these sins: But do not these sins too much abound among too many of them that have made Sepe∣ration from the Church of England? Who are more ignorant and prouder than many of them? Where is there greater Hypocrisie, Envy, Hatred, and Malice, than among too many of them? But if they will not conform and reform to the Go∣vernment
of the Church of England in due time, the Lord will not onely leave them, but he will laugh at them when Distress and Anguish cometh upon them; as Desolation and Destructi∣on as a Whirl-wind; then they may call upon the Lord but he will not answer them; they may seek him early and yet not find him, be∣cause they have slighted and hated knowledge, which would have men to depart from evil and to chuse the fear of the Lord; as without know∣ledge the mind cannot be good; so without o∣bedience the knowledge is not good, for they that do flight and undervalue the Word of God, and the Prayers of the Church of England, they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their Devices; for the turning away of the simple will slay, and the prosperity of fools destroy them: but who so hearkeneth unto the Lord, and keeps in the good old way, will dwell safely, and be quiet from the fear of evil. From Fornication and all other deadly Sins, and from all the Deceits of the World, the Flesh and the Devil. It becomes all that would be saved, to pray that the Lord would give them power against them, and victory over them; for the hearts of all men are deceitful, and the best of men are subject to fall into the worst of sins: But there is a ge∣neration of Men that will not say the Prayers of the Church of England, but will take liberty to sin, that Grace may abound; but from such Men
the good Lord deliver me: From Lightning and Tempest, from devouring Fire, from Plague, Pestilence, and Famine, from Battle and Mur∣der, and from sudden Death, the good Lord deliver all that do desire and endeavour to fear, love, serve, and honour him. It becomes all wise and faithful Christians to do what they can to prevent Judgments and to remove them, and not by Contentions and Di∣visions to hasten them, and to bring them upon us, when that they that profess the Gospel of Peace, by their Pride, Envy, and Hatred, are ready to devour one another. It doth provoke the God of Heaven to send great and heavy Judgments to Amaze, Confound, and Consume and Destroy one another. Was there ever such a Plague and such a Fire as was in London 1665, and 1666; I hope it will never be forgot; nor the Popish late Plot in 1678, against his Majesties Royal Person, and to ruin many Thousands in the Nation; but blessed and praised be the God of Heaven, who doth daily watch over his Majesties Royal Person, and the whole Nation. Therefore let all that do profess the Gospel, learn to live in Love and Peace, to be of one Mind, and to speak the same thing; for this is the best way and the soonest way, that the Name of God may be more and more known upon Earth, and his saving Health among all Nations; that so the People may praise him; yea, that all People may praise him with new obedience; then will the Earth bring forth great Increases; and among all
Nations there will be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace. Let all them therefore that love the Lord, be joyful in the Lord; let them servet he Lord with gladness, and come before his Presence with a Song; for the Lord is a great God, and a great King, above all Gods. The Sea is his, and he made it, and his Hands prepared the dry Land. Therefore let all People in all Nations worship and fall down before the Presence of this great Lord, Maker and Possessor of Heaven and Earth, and kneel before him, for he is the Lord our God, and we are the People of his Pasture. Therefore let us go into his Gates with Thanks∣giving, and into his Courts with Praise. Let all People in all Nations be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name; for the Lord is gracious, his Mercy is everlasting, and his Truth endureth from Generation to Generation. There∣fore let all the Sons and Daughters of Men praise his great and glorious Name, from the rising of the Son, to the going down of the same: Let every thing that hath Breath praise the Lord, for his Greatness and Goodness; for his Name is most excellent, and his Glory is above the Heavens. As this great and mighty. God stirr'd me up in time to make known his Mind, to prevent much Ruin to Mankind; that so a∣mong all Nations, there may be a general Re∣formation; then let all Dissentors and Sectaries, readily and willingly, conform and reform to the Government of the Church of England;
which will encourage many Atheists, Papists, Jews, Turks, and Infidels, to be in love with the Protestant Religion, as it is establisht in the Church of England. A Friend loveth at all times, and a Brother is born for Adversity; and the Wounds of a Friend are better than the Kisses of an Enemy: God in Man, and God with Man, will bring a∣bout great and wonderful things; not onely for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, but for the great Joy, Peace, and Pro∣sperity of many Nations; and that without mak∣ing of many Words, or having the Voice much heard. Pleasant words they be as a Honey-comb, sweet to the Soul and health to the Bones. And as Ointment and Perfume doth rejoyce the Heart, so doth the Sweetness of a Mans Friend by hearty Counsel in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sovereign his Majesty of Great Pritain. All unbelieving Jews, bruirish A∣thiests, wicked and bloody Papists, and rebellious Dissentors and Sectaries, will be ashamed and confounded, that have not improved their time to know and to understand the great Mystery of Godliness, God manifest in the Flesh, who was justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World by many, both Jews and Gentiles, and is received up into Glory; and there is preparing a place for them that do believe in him, and appear for him; but he will pour contempt upon all them that will not know and obey him, who is the Lord
of Life, the King of Glory, the Prince of Peace, the Captain of Mans Salvation, the Son of Righ∣teousness, that can and will heal all their Di∣seases, and pardon all their Sins that come unto him; and well he may, because he is the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the wonderful Coun∣seller, the Lord of Hosts, who is strong and mighty in Battle; that can readily and easily, by weak and unlikely means, confound and con∣sume the Enemies of his Gospel, that do slight and undervalue him; be they never so many, be they never so great: But he will not break a bruised Reed, nor quench the smoaking Flax, till it bring forth Judgement unto Victory. It is not a thing of indifferency, but it is of abso∣lute necessity, for the Sons and the Daughters of Men, the Wisest, the Strongest, the Richest, and the Learned'st, and Poorest among them, for to believe in the Son of God; for whosoever be∣lieveth in him, whether they be Jew or Gentile, hath everlasting Life begun in them; but they that will not believe and obey him, will not see Life, but the Wrath of the ever living God abideth on them. Condemnation or Salvation, will be the lot and portion of the Sons and Daughters of Men, that ever have been, or o∣ver will be in the World. O that none might miscarry, because the Lord has laid help upon one that is mighty, both able and willing to save unto the uttermost all that come unto him, and he will in no wise cast out; for God the Fa∣ther sent not his Son, his beloved Son, into
the World, that he should condemn the World, but that the World through him might be saved. Therefore he that believeth in him is not con∣demned, for he hath the witness in himself, but he that believeth not is condemned; and there is not any that can be a witness for him or them, but all their works and duties will be witnesses against them. This made the Apostle St.Paul, that great and eminent Saint, count all his Righteousness, Works and Learning, to be loss and dross in comparison of that excellent, most profitable, and comfortable knowledge that he found in Christ. The fruit of the Righteous is a tree of Lise, and he that winneth Souls is wise; and they that turn many to Righteousness, shall shine as the Stars for ever and ever. This is a high and honourable work, plea∣sant, profitable, and delightsome work, victo∣rious, glorious, and crowning work, that will crown the God of Heaven with much Glory a∣mong the Sons of Men, and our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain, with great Ho∣nour and Power over them; over all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Empe∣rors, that so many Nations may be freed from slavery, and throughout the whole World there may be great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity. It is sad to consider how that too many do make themselves poor and miserable in the ser∣vice of the World, the Flesh and the Devil, and that how few do readily and willingly, and cheerfully engage in the service of the God of Hea∣ven;
whose service is perfect freedom, and his work and reward is most honourable. They do well that do love their Enemies, that do often feed them and relieve them; for the Lord doth make his Son to shine both on the Evil and on the Good; and sendeth Rain on the Just and on the Unjust. To do good to all Men it is commendable, but to do good to the Houshold of Faith, it is most profitable, and will prove most comfortable. A Friend loveth at all times, but a true and a faithful Friend may be so much displeased, as not to manifest his Love at all times. Joseph loved his Brethren when he stormed at them, spake roughly to them, put some of them in Prison, and caused Simcon to be bound before their Eyes: But as after Storms and Tem∣pests the Sun doth shine most clearest, so after great and long Trials, Troubles and Afflictions, Deliverance will be the sweetest, both to a Per∣son, a Family, a City, and a Kingdom. Let not any therefore despise the day of small things; let not any slight and undervalue the small be∣ginnings of Grace in themselves or others; for a spark of Grace well proved and improved, will break forth into a flame, for the Glory of Gods great Name; and to bring a King and Kingdom to great Honour, Renown and Fame. The greatest Tree was a Plant, and the Wisest the Strongest, the Richest and most Learned'st Man was a Child. They that have truth of Grace, let them labour to grow in Grace, by improving the means of Grace which the God of Heaven has appointed,
and the Church of England has ordained; for they that do labour to grow in Grace, will have increase of every Grace, and so will grow in the favour of God and good Men, and of the Angels in Heaven: They that have truth of Grace and do improve it, will have increase of Grace, and will never lose it, but will know when and how for to use it in the worst of times, and be∣fore the best of Men: for the Glory of the most High, and the great Honour and Exalta∣tion of Englands Royal Majesty. Were there as many Nations, as many Worlds as there be Men, there is a way to subdue them, for the Glory of the great and mighty God, for the Credit of his Holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, for the great Exaltation of his Majesty of Great Britain, and the great Joy, Peace, and Pro∣sperity of many Kingdoms; and that is by daily getting Wisdom, Power, and Strength from him, who gives to the whole Creation a Being; which Divine Wisdom, Power, and Strength, will inable a mortal Man to prepare high and honourable Works, to be managed by many Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men; that have their Wisdom, their Power and Strength, their Ho∣nours, Riches, great and high Places, from the God of Heaven. The Lord is a high and strong Tower, and a Shield to all them that trust in him. Great Deliverances giveth he unto his King, and sheweth Mercy to his Annointed, to
David and to his Seed for evermore: And who dare say, that our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain, is not of the Seed of David Spiritually; the Lord who is most great and most good, has known his Soul in Adversity, and did bring him to his Throne in great Peace and Prosperity. The King trusteth in the Lord, there∣fore through the Mercy of the most High, he will not be moved, but the right Hand of the Lord will find out all his Enemies; he will find out all them that hate him; he will make them like a fiery Oven in time of his Anger; the Lord will destroy them in his Wrath, and the Fire will devour them; but the King our Royal So∣veraign, his Majesty of Great Britain, will re∣joyce in the Strength of the Lord; yea, how greatly will he rejoyce in his Salvation; the Lord has given him his hearts desire, and hath not denied him the request of his Lips, but hath given him liberal Blessings, and hath set a Crown of pure Gold upon his Head. He asked Life of thee, and thou Lord of Life hath given it him, when he was pursued by unreasonable, bloody, and deceitful Men; for which let all People in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; and in many other Nations, praise God, and be very thankful. The Lord, who has wonderfully pre∣served his Majesties Royal Person, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of many Nations, and has set him and sent him as a Blessing a∣mong his People; make him glad with the light of thy Countenance. Remember him, O Lord,
with the favour of thy People, and visit him with thy Salvation; that he may see the Feli∣city of thy Chosen, and rejoyce in the Joy of thy People, and glory with thine Inheritance, in thine everlasting and most glorious Kingdom, when this mortal Life will be at end: The Lord preserve him both at home and abroad, both by Land and Water; that so he and his through∣out the whole World, may bear the greatest sway, while time and all things under the Sun doth pass away: Make known in time this no∣ble Design, for the great Joy, Peace, and Pro∣sperity of Mankind; by John Varney, a Member of the Church of England, and a Subject to his Majesty of Great Britain; but such a Subject that the God of Heaven has honoured among the Sons of Men, for to engage with him, for to bring about such high and honourable Work, pleasant, profitable, and delightsome Work, victorious, glo∣rious, and crowning Work; for the great honour and renown of his Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England; which has not yet been done by all the Parliaments that have been since England has injoyed a King. Shall the Church of England, which is the Spouse of Christ, bring forth Princes, each one resembling the Children of a King, and she sit in the Dust, slighted and reproached by her E∣nemies, both at home and abroad? This ought not to be, this must not be, but the Sons of the most High must appear for her readily, wil∣lingly: and cheerfully. As our Royal Soveraign,
his Majesty of Great Britain, has been the great∣est Prince in the World for suffering, so I shall endeavour in these days of the Gospel, by the power of Faith, which is the power of God, that he may be the greatest King and Emperor in the World, and over the World, for Wisdom, Power, and Strength, for Honour, Riches, and great Glory; so that those Nations which have paid Tribute to the Church of Rome, to their great loss and shame, will be glad to pay Tri∣bute to the Church of England; for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, and the great Exaltation of his Majesty of Great Britain; because it will be for their great Joy, Freedom, and Gain: so that the way of the Lord will be known more and more upon Earth, and his saving Health among all Nations. So that the People will praise him, yea, all Peo∣ple will praise him with new Obedience; so that the Earth will bring forth great Increase, and among all People in all Nations there will be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace. Let every Man continue in that honest, and lawful Calling, which Divine Providence has placed them in: for it is unsuitable and un∣comely for the Ministers to follow the Trades∣mans Calling, or the Tradesman the Ministers Work, as too many have done in these days of the Gospel, to the great shame of the Prote∣stant Religion and the Church of England. There is no Place, Calling, or Condition, that will honour Men, if that they be not careful
to honour God and our Royal King, his Ma∣jesty of Great Britain, in them. And when that the God of Heaven doth indue any Man with Divine Wisdom and Power, for to under∣stand his Mind, what may be done, and what is to be done, for the great Honour, Peace, and Prosperity of a King and Kingdom; let that Man make it known in time to that Minister whom God has set over him, and the Minister to the Bishop whom God has set over him, and the reverend Bishop, in due time and season, to the Kings most Excellent Majesty, whom the God of Heaven, under him, has made, among the Sons of Men, Supream over all Persons and Causes: But if that Man be not minded and regarded by the Wise, Godly, and the Learned, whom the most Wise God doth enable in time, for to make known his Mind, to prevent much Ruin to Mankind; then the Wise, Godly, and the Learned, are guilty of those Troubles and Judgements that comes both upon themselves and the Nation; and they may call and cry un∣to the God of Heaven, to help to deliver them, but he will not regard them, because he will help, save, and deliver them when he will, and by whom he will. Every good and per∣fect Gift is from above, from the Father of Lights, in whom is no variableness or shadow of turning. Both the preparation of the Heart, and the answer of the Tongue, it is from the Lord. Therefore let the Man be what he will or whom he will, whom he doth indue with
Wisdom and Power, for to understand his Mind, to do his Will, and to injoy his Favour in his Calling; let not that Man leave his Calling suddenly nor unadvisedly, but let him prove and improve his Graces in his Calling, till that Authority whom the God of Heaven has set o∣ver him commands him from it. I have been very backward and very unwilling to have my mind made known in print, and I have been much discouraged thereunto, but true Valour will take Incouragement from Discouragement. That which doth require it, and puts me upon it, to have it done, in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal and Gracious So∣veraign, it is the Glory of the great and mighty God, the Credit of his Holy Gospel, the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England; the great Exaltation of our Royal So∣veraign, his Majesty of Great Britain, and the great Shame, Contempt, and Terror of the Turk the Pope, and the Devil; and all the Workers of Evil; that so many Nations may by freed from slavery, and throughout the whole World there may be great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity. This is the Lords doings, who is great in Counsel and mighty in Power, whose Arm is very long and very strong, though he doth make use of a weak and unlikely Man; therefore let it be marvellous in the Eyes of them that be most wise. I hope that our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain, will countenance, encourage,
and set forward this Noble Design, that Divine Wisdom and Power has enabled me, for to make known in time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind. As for the great Exalta∣tion of his Majesties Royal Person, and the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of many Nations. Great has been the Trials and Troubles of the Church of England, from her Enemies, both at home and abroad; so great will be her Joy, her Triumphs, and Victory over her Enemies, both at home and abroad: for the Lord will restore Health unto thee, and will heal thee of thy Wounds; therefore fear thou not, nor be dis∣mayed, for the Lord who is most Great and most Good, will save thee from afar, and thy Seed from the Land of their Captivity; and thou shalt be in Rest and Quiet, and none shall make thee afraid; for the Lord who is most wise and most strong is with thee, to save thee; though he should make a full End of those Nations that Worship Idols and Graven Images, yet will he not make a full end of thee, but he will cor∣rect thee in Measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished; therefore sing with glad∣ness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the Nations; Publish ye Praise, and say, O Lord save thy People, the Remnant of Israel, the Remnant of England, the Remnant of Lon∣don, after such devouring Wars, a wasting Pesti∣lence, and Consuming Fires; for the Lord who is most great and most good, he kills, and he makes alive, he wounds and he heals, he casts
down and he raises up, a Person, a Family, a City and a Kingdom, when he will, and by whom he will. The Lord that scattered Israel, has scat∣tered England, and wounded London; for is there any Evil in the City, but the Lord has done it, by inflicting of it, and permitting of it; for the Workers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil doers, the Children of Disobedience, are Gods Rod, and Gods Sword, to punish his Children when they walk contrary unto him: but as the End of the Rod is to be burnt, so the End of the wicked is to be cut off; they are such Chaff that the Lord knows when and how to scatter them; and such Briars and Thorns, that he can when he please, with much Ease consume them. Who ever hardened themselves against God, and pro∣spered? What got proud Pharaoh with his Six hundred chosen Chariots, and all the Chariots of Egypt, but sudden ruine and destruction? What got Sizera with his Nine Hundred Chariots of Iron, but shameful ruine and destruction? For himself was killed by a Woman, and his Army of a sudden routed and destroyed? What got Sennacherib, that proud King of Assyria, who did insult and reproach against the living God, and the good King Hezekiah, but in one Night it pleased the Lord to send his Angel, who did destroy a Hundred fourscore and five Thousand of his Men, almost two Hundred Thousand; a great Army! but yet not Power and Strength enough to withstand one Angel. And when the proud King departed and came to Nineveh, as he
was worshiping his Idol-God, he was killed by two of his Sons: they that should have been his best Friends, were his worst Enemies. What got Ambitious and Proud Haman, who plotted and contrived the destruction of many Thousands of the Jews, but the ruine of himself and all his Posterity; for both he and his Ten Sons were Hanged for such Treachery: But yet the workers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil doers, the Children of Disobedience, are not afraid nor a∣shamed to combine and design to destroy the Righteous, although the Righteous Lord, who is most Wise and most strong, doth defend them, and will Wound and Consume them that do offend them. What says our Saviour, who is the Lord of Life and the King of Glory? It were better that a Milstone were Hanged a∣bout the Neck of unbelieving Jews, Bruitish A∣thiests, wicked, bloody, and deceitful Papists, and rebellious Dissentors and Sectaries, than to of∣fend the least Member that doth believe in him; because they be as dear unto him as the Apple of his Eye: they are his purchased, ransomed, and redeemed ones, they are his chosen and beloved ones: They are the travel of his Soul, and for them he has prepared both a Kingdom and a Crown, which is immortal and unchangeable; but there is not any of the Sons and the Daughters of Men that can merit or purchase it, in what they can do or suffer; therefore say unto the righteous, be what they will, where they will, and whom they will, that it will be well with them.
It will be well with them here in their worst con∣dition, and under their greatest Tryals, Troubles, and Afflictions, but it will be better with them hereafter, for Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor the Heart of Man is not able to con∣ceive, what God has laid up for them that love him; but wo unto the Wicked, unto all the workers of Iniquity because it will go ill with them, they will have the fruit of their own do∣ings, of their own works, and not the fruit of Christs merits and purchase, because they do slight and undervalue him, and will not be ruled by him, who is the wisest Counsellor, the best Comforter, and the greatest Suporter; who is a present help in time of trouble: But the Wicked the Seed of Evil doers, the Children of Disobedience, the Workers of Iniquity, the Enemies of the Gospel; do many times fall into trouble, and their Friends leave them, the De∣vil hates them, and God forsakes them; but whosoever they be that hearkeneth unto the Lord so as to abey him, will dwell safely, and be quiet from the fear of Evil: much more from the lust of Evil: but for the Work∣ers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil doers the Children of Disobedience, though Hand joyn in Hand, they will not be unpunished; but many times Transgressors, and the Workers of Iniquity are destroyed together. What got the Spanish Armado, whom the Pope called the Invincible Armado, presuming no power could with-stand them, much less overcome them? But
it pleased the Lord, who is most great and most good, to help his Hand-maid, Elizabeth Queen of England (of Blessed Memory) that they was so, in giving her a Victorious and a Glorious Con∣quest barer'd and scater'd, so defaced and dis∣graced, that they will never recover while they be a Nation. And that Men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works unto the Children of Men; when that the Enemies of the Gospel do what they can to destroy them: But though they should dig as deep as Hell, from the Eye of Men, yet the Eye of God doth alwaies see them. What got the bloody Papists, the Gun-powder Traytors by combining and designing to undermine and over∣throw, with one blow, Religion, Laws, and Liberty, Nobility, and Gentry. Yea all the Royal Fa∣mily? But it pleased the Lord, whose Wisdom is unsearchable, to help the King; to understand the Traytors Treason, and to give that Wisdom to his Majesties Royal Grand-Father; King James of England, of famous Memory, that his Friends did Admire him, and his Enemies was Confounded by him; for he soon apprehended the Plot, and gave speedy order for the dis∣covering and securing of the Traytors, which was soon done, and they brought to their de∣served shame and ruine; for they were taken in their own Nets, did fall into their own Pits, and there violent Dealings came down upon their own Pates. The Lord who is most wise and most strong, will not cast away a perfect Man,
neither will he help the Evil doers, but Evil doers will he cut off; but they that wait upon the Lord will inherit the Earth. In these Go∣spel days, and in the Reign of our Royal Sove∣reign his Majesty of Great Britain, great will be the Peace of the Church of Christ, through the whole world; but especially in England, Scotland, France, and Ireland: therefore many will come and Sing in the Right of Sion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord, for Wheat and for Wine, and for Oil, and for the Young of the Flock and of the Herd; and their Soul shall be as a Water'd Garden, and they shall not Sorrow any more at all as they have done; then will the Virgin rejoyce in the Dance, both Young Men and Old together; for the Lord will turn their Mourning into Joy, and will Comfort them, and will make them Rejoyce from their sorrow; and it will come to pass, that like as the Lord hath Watched o∣ver his People, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to af∣flict; so will he Watch over them, to Build and to Plant; and he will gather them out of all Countries whither he hath driven them in his Anger, in his Fury, and in great Wrath; and the Lord will bring them again unto his Holy Place: to worship him in a right Manner And he will cause them to dwell safely, and he will be their God, and they shall be his People; and the Lord will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear, love, and serve him;
for ever, for the good of themselves and of their Children after them: And because the Sons and the Daughters of Men do too often forget to re∣member their Creator, Redeemer, and Preserver, he will make an Everlasting Covenant with them, that he will not turn away from them to do them good, but he will put his fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from him; yea the Lord will rejoyce over them to do them good, and will plant them in his Land with his whole heart, and with his whole soul assuredly. For as the Lord who is most wise and most strong, has brought great evil upon his people for their rebellion, so will he bring upon them all the good that he has promised, that so they may be humbled and re∣formed; for the goodness of God should lead men to repentance, but not unto disobedience: He that knows his Masters will, and doth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes. All men under the Heavens are bound to know their Creator, so as to fear him; but there be many of the Sons and the Daughters of Men, that will labour to know him, so as to love, serve, and to honour him; which will prove most comfortable to them∣selves, and most profitable to others. Let the man be what he will, or whom he will, in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, in whom the Lord of Hosts doth arise, his Enemies shall be scattered, and they that hate him shall flee be∣fore him, as Wax melteth before the sire, so will all the workers of iniquity at the presence of the
Lord; but the Righteous shall be glad and rejoyce for a long time: The Church of Rome, the King of Spain, and the proud French King, has endea∣voured to undermine and overthrow the Prote∣stant Religion, His Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England; but the time is come, that they are to know, that they are to be brought very low, if that they will not Conform and Re∣form to the Protestant Religion, to the Nine and thirty Doctrines of the Church of England. There is no man worthy to be a Minister of the Gospel in England. Scotland, France and Ireland, that doth or should oppose, gain-say, or preach against any of the Nine and thirty Doctrines of the Church of England: The Enemies against the Church of England are many both at home and a∣broad, but I shall endeavour by the power of Faith, which is the power of God, for to do what I can to over-throw them as one man, and to set a-work they that have power in their hand, that they may be subdu'd both by Sea and Land; that so the people may know the true and the ever∣living God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent: then will the Earth bring forth great increase, and among all people in all Nations, there will be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace. The Lord who is most Great, and most Good, knows when, how, and by whom he pleases, for to speak peace to a Person, a Family, a City, and a Kingdom, and when he speaks peace to his Peo∣ple, to any of his Saints, let them not turn again to Folly, but let them renew their Obedience,
and double their Diligence: The Lord will satiate the Soul of the Priests, of his Ministers, with Fat∣ness, and the people with his Goodness; surely his Salvation is nigh them that fear him, that Glo∣ry may dwell in our Land. Mercy and Truth are met together, Righteousness and Peace have kis∣sed each other: Truth shall spring out of the Earth, Righteousness shall look down from Hea∣ven, yea the Lord will give that which is good; so that our Land will yield her Increase: Righte∣ousness will go before him, and set us in the way of his Steps. The Lord who is most Great and most Good, will be known by his Judgments and his Mercies, for he is a God that judgeth the earth; for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him all mens Thoughts and Actions are weighed. That our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain, may be willing to countenance, encou∣rage, and set forward this Noble Design, that Di∣vine Wisdom and Power has enabled me to make known in time, for the Glory of his Great Name, and to have his Enemies brought to shame: His Royal Majesty will find that many Princes and Nations will assist him; and that, which is more than all them, the God of Heaven, who has all Power in his own hand, and the whole Creation at Command, will in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, make bare his Arm, and manifest his Wisdom, Power, and Strength, to bring down the Turk, the Pope, the French King, and the King of Spain, that so many Nations may be freed from slavery, and
throughout the whole World there may be great joy, peace and prosperity. Sing unto the Lord thy God, O Church of England, for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all the Earth, for among the Gods there is none like unto him, there is not one that can do as he has done: Say to them therefore that are of a fearful Heart, be strong, fear not, for the True and the Everlasting God, will come with ven∣geance and rebukes upon his Enemies; but with great recompence and rewards, will he come and save, and deliver his People, that wait up∣on him, and put their trust and confidence in him; therefore cry out and Shout thou Inha∣bitant of Sion, thou Church of England, for great is the Holy one of Israel, in the midst of thee, for to bring thee to great honour, re∣nown and fame, and thy Enemies to great shame. Behold the Whirl-wind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing Whirl-wind; it will fall with pain upon the Head of the Wicked; the fierce anger of the Lord will not return, until he hath performed the intents of his Heart, in these latter daies; many will see it, and consi∣der of it, thy God, O Church of England, is my God, thy cause is my cause, thy troubles have been my greatest trouble, and thy Enemies are my worst Enemies I have laid to Heart more the troubles of the Church of England, and of his Majesty of Great Britain, than the Death of a Wife and seven Children; I have laid them
more to Heart than all the tryals, troubles, los∣ses, crosses and reproaches, that I have met with∣al from my Youth, to this present time: I have laid them so to Heart, that many will be made to smart, that have endeavoured to undermine and to overthrow the Protestant Religion, his Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England. I have laid them so to Heart, that many will be made to smart, that will not conform and reform to the Protestant Religion, as it is establisht in the Church of England. When the Lyon Roars, all the Beasts of the Field trem∣ble, the Lord has not been much minded, nor regarded, by his Judgements of Plague, Fire and Sword; but he will be minded and regar∣ded by a still Voice, by inabling of me for to make known his mind, for the terror of Evil doers; the Voice of the Lord is powerful, the Voice of the Lord is full of Majesty; the Voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars; yea the Lord breaketh the Cedars of Lebanon: The Lord thy God, O Church of England, who is most great and most good, will be known to be the True and Everlasting God among the Sons of men; for by terrible things in Righteousness, will he answer them. For a long time the Lord has hol∣den his peace, he has been still, and refrained himself, but now will he cry like a Travelling Woman; he will destroy and devour at once, and that without making of many words, or ha∣ving the Voice much heard: The time is come that in these Gospel days; and in the Reign
of our Royal Soveraign, his Majesty of Great Britain, that the Lord of Hosts will go forth as a mighty Man: he will stir up jealousie like a Man of war; he will cry, yea Roar; but he will prevail against his Enemies, as the Turk, the Pope, and the Devil; and all the Workers of Evil. Who knoweth the power of Gods an∣ger? according to his fear, so is his wrath; for he is terrible out of his Holy places; therefore tremble thou Earth at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob: tremble therefore all you Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World, that do slight and undervalue the Word of God, and question his mighty power; tremble therefore all you unbelieving Jews, Bruitish Atheists, wicked and bloody Papists, and rebellious Dissentors and Sectaries, that have not made the Word of God your Rule, nor his Spirit your Guide, nor his Glory your Aim. Tremble therefore all you Earthly and Carnal-minded Men, you Self-sekers and Men-pleasers, Lovers of your selves more than Lovers of God, your King and Countrey. Tremble all you that have a Name to live, and are dead; that have called your selves Saints, but have acted like Devils Incarnate against the God of Heaven, the Protestant Religion, his Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England: but let the Righteous be glad, and re∣joyce all ye that do truly fear God and Honour the King; and are faithful to the Protestant Religion. This Noble Design, that Divine wis∣dom
and power, has enabled me to make known in time, it will be as a hand-writing upon the wall against all the Enemies of the Gospel, both great and small; so that many will fall in love with the Protestant Religion, and will be ready and willing to serve, and to honour his Ma∣jesty of Great Britain, both at home and abroad. Light is sowen for the Righteous, and Glad∣ness for the upright in Heart, ye that love the Lord, hate Evil; for he preserveth the Souls of his Saints, he delivereth them many a time out of the Hands of unreasonable, bloody, and de∣ceitful men, that lie in wait for to destroy them: Therefore rejoyce in the Lord ye Righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of his Holi∣ness; for the Lord who is most good, is most great, therefore is greatly to be praised, and to be feared above all Gods; therefore let all wise, strong, rich, and learned Men, declare his Glory among the Heathens, and his wonders among all People; for honour and Majesty are before him, strength and beauty is in his Sanctuary; therefore let all People in all Nations learn to know the true and the everlasting God, and to worship him as they do in the Church of Eng∣land, with Reverence and with a holy Fear: They that fear the Lord, who is most great, will love him because he is most good; and they that love him, will delight in him; and he will give them the desires of their Hearts, and that is truth of Grace, strength of Grace, and increase
of Grace. It is commendable, and will prove very profitable and comfortable to the Sons and Daughters of Men, for to delight in the Word of God; so that it may richly in them dwell; then their sleep will be sweet, and they will have great Joy, Rest and Peace, that Peace which passeth the understanding of Men and Angels, to declare what it is; it is the Peace of God, which is better felt then exprest: that peace which the World cannot give, nor take away. They that do injoy much of God, must lay out themselves much for him, in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Sove∣raign, his Majesty of Great Britain. That Man which will make his graces to appear for the great honour of God, the King, and Nation; He must charge to the Front and to the Rear, he must charge and charge again, and that with might and main, that  the Turk, the Pope, and the Devil, and all the Workers of E∣vil, to shame; and that without making a noise about Religion, for this Party, or for that Opi∣nion, without making of many words, or having the Voyce much heard; without having a Sword in the hand. A Christian Souldier that is enga∣ged in holy War, against the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, must quit himself like a man; and when he has done all, for to stand by the power of Faith, which is the power of God in man, the power of God for man, and the power of God with man. Who knows what is in the Womb of a Day, or in the Heart of a man? Not any but
the God of Heaven, who can when he will, and by whom he will, bring Order out of Confusion, Light out of Darkness, Good out of Evil, and Peace out of Trouble; for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, and the great Peace and Prosperity of many Nations: As the highest Member under the God of Heaven, doth give Protection for the Safety of the meanest Member in the Church of England; so sometimes the meanest Member with the God of Heaven, may give Direction for the great Honour, Exal∣tation, and Consolation of the Highest in the days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal So∣veraign His Majesty of Great Britain: Cursed be that Man that dare lift up his hand against the Lords Anointed, by Sea or by Land, against the Lords Anointed, whom the Most High hath made Great in Place, and Inriched with his Grace: Is it not the Prayer of the Church of England for His Majesty of Great Britain, that the Lord would hear him in the day of trouble, and send him help from the Sanctuary, and strengthen him out of Sion: For his Majesty can have no such Help as from the Sanctuary, nor no such Strength as out of Sion: The God of Heaven has promi∣sed, whose Promises are all Yea and Amen in Christ: That the Deliverer shall come out of Sion, which shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: But Sion, which is the Church of Christ, through∣out the whole World, and the Church of Christ in England, Scotland, France and Ireland, must not look for the Deliverer of Sion to come in greater
Pomp than the Saviour of Sion came: but he that shall come, whom the God of Heaven will send, will come, and will not tarry; for the Tree will be known by his Fruit: for he will purifie the Sons of Levy, and purge them as Gold and Sil∣ver, that they may offer unto the true and ever∣living God, who is most Great and most Good, an Offering in Righteousness, which will be plea∣sing and exceptable to him: The Stone which the Builders refused, is it not become the Head-stone of the Corner? This is the Lords Doings, who is Great in Counsel and Mighty in Power, therefore let it be marvellous in the Eyes of them that be most wise. And let not any despise the Day of small things; for as the Lord of Hosts is above all, so he is more than all, and can be with all, in all, for all, or against all, when and by whom he please: for as his Wisdom is unsearchable, so his Power it is unresistable, though the Instrument he may use among wise, strong, rich, and learned men, may be mean and contemptible. But ever since that I have been precious in the Eyes of the most great and glorious God, I have been ho∣nourable; therefore I have not coveted after Sil∣ver or Gold, Houses or Lands, Offices or great Places; but I have laboured and coveted to get and to keep, to prove and to improve, Rich Gra∣ces, that so my Fruit may be better than Gold, and may do more good for the Honour and Re∣nown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Exaltation of His Majesty of Great Britain, and the great Peace and Prosperity of many King∣doms,
than an Army of Men, or thousands, or ten thousands of Gold or Silver has done: I have no grace but what I have received; so I have none to be proud of; I have not received any, but what I have laboured to improve; so I have not any to be prodigal with: the least grace which I have received from the God of all grace, I do e∣steem it above all the Honours and Riches in the World; because that true Grace it is abiding, sa∣tisfying, lasting, and everlasting: but for the Honours, the Riches and Pleasures of this World, they be short, they be not abiding, satisfying, nor long-lasting: therefore they that would have Grace, which is Heavenly Treasure, to thrive in their Soul, they must value and esteem it above Silver and Gold. To be made Partaker of the Di∣vine Nature, it is high Honour and great Favour. The Righteous shall be glad in the Lord, because they trust in him; and all the upright in heart will glory. Salvation comes not from the Moun∣tains, nor from the Hills; not from wise, strong, rich, and learned men, but from the Lord, who made the Earth and the Heavens, and that when and by whom he will; that all the Glory may re∣dound to him: for his right Hand and holy Arm hath the preheminence over all persons in all Na∣tions. Let them shout for joy and be glad that fa∣vour my Righteous Cause; yea let them say con∣tinually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the Prosperity of his Servants; and my Tongue shall speak of his Righteousness, and of his Praise all the day long; for he hath done
marvellous things. All the Ends of the Earth that have not seen, will see the Salvation of God: He maketh Wars to cease unto the End of the Earth. He breaketh the Bow and cutteth the Spear asun∣der, and burneth the Chariots in the fire when he pleaseth, and by whom he please, in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign His Majesty of Great Britain. They that trust to their Chariots and Horses will fail, but they that trust in the Lord Jehovah, in the use of Means, and above Means, will prevail. There is a River, the Streams thereof will make glad the City of God, which is the Church of God throughout the whole World: For one fair Flood doth send a∣broad such pleasant Streams apace to refresh the City of our God, and to wash his Holy Place. Is not the Mighty God in Sion? Go walk about, and go round about her, tell the Towers thereof, mark ye well her Bulwarks, consider her Palaces, that ye may tell it to the Generation following; for God, who is most wise, and most strong, is with her, and is known in her Palaces for a Refuge; She is Beautiful for Situation; the Joy of the whole Earth is Mount Sion, and the City of the great King. The Kings of the Earth in these days of the Gospel, and in the Raign of our Royal So∣veraign, His Majesty of Great Britain; they will admire her Wisdom, Power and Strength, her Honours, Riches and great Glory. Shall Deliverance be at hand, and the Church of England at a stand? Shall there be a Well of Water near Hagar, and she weep and be in di∣stress?
Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day? Or shall a Nation be born at once? For as soon as Sion travelled she brought forth, before her pain came, she was delivered of a Man-child. Shall the Lord, who is most Wise and most Strong, bring to the Birth, and not cause to bring forth; or cause to bring forth, and shut the Womb, saith thy God: No it will not be, for in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Maje∣sty of Great Britain, the God of Heaven has many Sons and Daughters that are grown up, and many to be brought up, and more to be brought forth in the use of the Means of Grace which he has appointed, and the Church of England has or∣dained; but all the Children of the Most High that are brought up, and grown up, and to be brought forth; all is to be in opposition to the Turk, the Pope, and the Devil, and all the Workers of Evil; which will tend very much for the Glory of the Great and Mighty God, for the Credit of his holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of England, the great Exaltation of His Majesty of Great Britain, and the great Peace and Prosperity of many Kingdoms. O that the Sons and the Daughters of Men were wise, for to make an Improvement of the Wisdom and Power of the God of Heaven, which is better than Strength or Weapons of War, or Silver or Gold. As for the Wisdom that is in the World,
among unbelieving Jews, bruitish Atheists, wicked and bloody Papists, and rebellious Dis∣sentors and Sectaries, it is foolishness, and doth many times end in madness; for where Envy, Strife, and Contention is, it brings forth too of∣ten Sedition and Rebellion: But the Wisdom that is from above, it is pure and peaceable, gentle and easie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits; without partiality, and without hypo∣crisie: but where Pride, Envy, Strife, and Con∣tention is, there is Confusion and every evil Work. Now a good man and a bad man will be known by their Fruits; for of Thorns men do not ga∣ther Figs, nor of a Bramble-bush gather they Grapes; but every Tree will be known by his own Fruit. A good man out of the good trea∣sure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good, that which is suitable and seasonable, pro∣sitable, comfortable, and advantageous to many Persons and Families in a City, and in a Kingdom. But an evil man, who is a wicked man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil, to the great hurt and undoing of too many Persons and Families in a City and in a Kingdom. It is commendable for the Sons of Men, the wisest, the strongest, the richest, and the most learnedst among them, for to have always their heart to be Inditing of a good Matter, and their Tongue to be as the Pen of a ready Writer; that that so they may declare the thing that they have framed, for the great Honour and Renown of the
King our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, and the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of his Kingdoms. How welcom should, because how Beautiful are, the Feet of him that bringeth good Tidings, that publisheth Peace; that bringeth good Ti∣dings of good, that saith unto Sion, the Church of England, Thy God Raigneth: Awake, awake, put on thy Strength, O Zion, put on thy Beau∣tiful Garments, O Church of England, shake thy self from the Dust, from the Reproaches that thy Enemies have cast upon thee: Loose thy self from the bands of thy Neck, for thou shalt break forth on the right hand, and on the left, and thy Seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate Cities to be inhabited; in Righteousness shalt thou be established; thou shalt be far from Op∣pression, for thou shalt not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near thee, so as to hurt thee; the Sons of them that have afflicted thee, shall come bending unto thee, and all that despised thee, shall bow themselves down at the Soles of thy Feet: And thy Enemies shall call thee, O Church of England, the City of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel. Sing O Barren, thou that didst not bear, break forth into Singing, and cry aloud thou that didst not travel with Child; for more are the Children of the Desolate, than the Children of the Married Wife, saith the Lord: Rejoyce ye with Jerusalem, with the City of London, and be glad with her all ye that love her; Rejoyce for Joy with her, all ye that have mourn∣ed
for her; for the Lord will extend Peace to her like a River, and the Glory of the Gentiles like a slowing Stream; then shall ye suck and be satis∣fied with the Breasts of her Consolations, with the Means of Grace which God has appointed; for he will give unto thee, O Church of England; more and more Teachers after his own heart, which shall feed his people with Knowledge and Understanding; so that they shall milk out and be delighted with the abundance of thy Glory. And when you see this, you that are full of Fears and Doubts what will become of Zion? What will become of the Church of England? Your Hearts shall rejoyce, and your Bones shall flourish like an Herb; for the Hand of the Lord, the Power of the Lord, will be known towards his Servants, and his Indignation towards his Ene∣mies. The Nations that know not thy God, O Church of England, who is the true and the ever-living God, will be ashamed and con∣founded, for all their Wisdom, their Power and Strength; they shall lay their hand upon their Mouth, their Ears will be deaf, they shall lick the Dust like a Serpent, they shall move out of their holes like Worms of the Earth, they shall be afraid of the Lord our God, and shall fear because of thee, O Church of England: The Lord will be terrible unto thy Enemies, he will famish all the Gods of the Earth, that men may worship him, every one in his place, even all the Isles of the Heathen: then the rejoycing City that dwelt carelesly, that said in her Heart, I am, and there is none beside
me; how will she become a Desolation, a place for Beasts to lie down in; every one that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his head: for the Pope of Rome, who is the Whore of Babylon, and the Man of Sin, will become the Man of Sorrow: for the Lord will pour Contempt upon them that have poured Contempt upon his Word and Sacra∣ments; as all unbelieving Jews, bruitish Atheists, wicked, bloody and deceitful Papists, proud Dis∣sentors, and rebellious Sectaries have done: But if that they will not learn in these days of the Gospel to be humbled and reformed, they will be ashamed and confounded. Fear not, O Land, but be glad and rejoyce, for the Lord, who is most wise, and most strong, will do great things for thee, O England, for thee O London, above other Nations; for as thou hast had great sorrow and misery, so thou wilt have great honour and pro∣sperity: The time is come in these days of the Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign, His Majesty of Great Britain, that for thy shame the Lord will give thee double Honour, and for Confusion thou shalt greatly Rejoyce, everlasting Joy shall be unto thee: Thou hast drunken deep of the Cup of Gods Anger, but thy Enemies, they that hate thee, O Church of England, will drink the Dregs of it: Be glad then ye Children of Zi∣on, and rejoyce in the Lord your God, for thou shalt be no more tearmed, Forsaken, for thou shalt forget the shame of thy Youth, and shalt not re∣member the Reproach of thy Widow-hood any more, for thy Maker is thine Husband, the Lord
of Hosts is his Name. The Lord thy God in the midst of thee, O Church of England, is mighty, he will save, he will rejoyce over thee with Joy, he will rest in his Love, he will joy over thee with Singing; and the Gentiles shall see thy Righte∣ousness, and all Kings thy Glory; for thou wilt be as a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord, and as a Royal Diadem in the hand of thy God: For as a young man marrieth a Virgin, so will thy Sons marry thee; and as the Bridegroom rejoy∣ceth over the Bride, so will thy God rejoyce over thee: Therefore ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give him no rest till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem, the City of London, a Praise in the Earth: Praise the Lord O Jerusalem, praise thy God O Zion, for he hath strengthned the Bars of thy Gates, he hath blessed thy Children within thee; he maketh peace in thy Borders, and filleth thee with the sinest of the Wheat: He sheweth his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments unto Israel; He hath not dealt so with other Nations, and as for his Judgments they have not known them: Praise ye the Lord that be wise, for it is good to sing Prai∣ses unto our God; for it is pleasant, and praise is comely: For great is our Lord, and of great Power, his Understanding is insinite; he lifteth up the meek with much ease, when they be brought low, he casteth the wicked down to the ground, when they be so proud as not to know him, and so high as not to fear him. O that all the Sons and the Daughters of Men in these days of the
Gospel, and in the Reign of our Royal Soveraign His Majesty of Great Britain, would learn to be wise, and to know those things that do concern their Everlasting Peace, before they go hence and be seen no more; for Time flies, and Man daily dies: there is not an Hour in a Day, but many have their Breath taken away. All flesh is grass, and as the flower of the field, the grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the Word of thy God, O Church of England, shall stand for ever; Heaven and Earth will sooner fail, than one Tittle of Gods Word. Where the Word of a King is, there is Power, but how much more where the Word of the everliving God is, when it is set on by his Spi∣rit, which is a Spirit of Power, of Might, and of Majesty? It is a meek and a quiet Spririt, an humble and a holy Spirit; and it is the highest, loftiest, and most noblest Spirit; it is such a Spirit that it will enable them that will be ruled by it, for to attain, retain, maintain, and proclaim that which is most noble, excellent, and advantageous, for the great Honour, Peace and Prosperity of a King and Kingdom: Let all People in all Na∣tions rejoyce in him that made them; let the Children of Zion be joyful in their King: The Lord shall Reign for ever, even thy God, O Church of England, unto all Generations; therefore praise him all ye Nations; let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord: Praise him for his mighty Acts; who can express the Noble Acts of the Lord, they are so many and great? Not men or Angels: His wondrous Works in the Land of
Ham, and fearful things by the Red Sea: The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are o∣ver all his works; the Lord is great, and greatly to be Admired and Adored; he is clothed with Honour and Majesty, who covereth himself with Light as with a Garment, who stretcheth out the Heavens like a Curtain, who layeth the Beams of his Chambers in the Waters, who maketh the Clouds his Chariot, who walketh upon the Wings of the Wind, who maketh his Angels Spirits, his Ministers a flaming Fire; who laid the Founda∣tions of the Earth, that it should not be removed for ever; the Lord of Hosts is his Name. To be much in meditation of him will be sweet to the Soul, and health to the Body: I will be glad and rejoyce in the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praise to him while I have my being; for he hath redeemed my Life from Destruction, and hath Crowned me with Loving-kindness and tender Mercies; who satisfieth my Mouth with good things; so that my Youth has been renew∣ed as the Eagles: Well may my Soul therefore bless the Lord, and all that is within me bless his holy Name: Bless the Lord O my Soul, and for∣get not any of his Benefits; who forgiveth all thine Iniquities, and healeth all thy Diseases: The Glory of the Lord shall endure for ever; the Lord will rejoyce in his Works; the Lords Throne is in the Heavens, and his Kingdom ru∣leth over all: Therefore bless the Lord ye his An∣gels that excel in Strength, bless ye the Lord all ye his Hosts, ye Ministers of his that do his plea∣sure;
bless the Lord all ye his Works in all pla∣ces of his Dominion. Is it not in vain for the Church of England, for to pray, O God make speed to save us; O Lord make hast to help us; and do not mind and re∣gard when and by whom he will do it by whom can do it when he will, so he will do it by whom he will; and not when and by whom Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned-men please; the meaner and weaker the Instrument is, whom Al∣mighty God doth use, the greater is the Sin of them that do him slight, under-value, and re∣fuse. Long may the Church of England look for Peace, and meet with Trouble; look for Health, and meet with Disappointment; when she is not careful to mind the Day of her Visitation. Shall the Stork in the Heaven know her appointed time, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swal∣low observe the time of their coming? And shall not the Servants of the Lord understand his Mind, so as to endeavour to prevent his Judgments? Are they not counted wise-men that have the Law of the Lord with them? But are not such wise-men many times dismayed, ashamed, and taken, when they do reject the Word of the Lord, and rely upon the Traditions and Inventions of Mens ma∣king and framing, which are neither agreeable nor suitable to the Word of God, which is the Word of Life and of Power? What wisdom is in such men then, that wisdom which will deceive them? Who is so blind as they that should see most, and deaf as they that should hear best? Is there
no Balm in Gilead, is there no Physician there? Doubtless there is: Is not the Lord, the Lord Jehovah, in whom is Everlasting Strength in Zi∣on? Is not her King in her, and for her, and with her? Why then is not the health of the Daughter of Gods people recovered? Is there not any that stirs up himself to take hold of the true and ever∣living God, as they ought and should do; there∣fore hath the Lord, who is full of Wisdom, Power, and Strength, hid his Face from us: And by rea∣son of our many great and grievous Sins, we have all been very much afflicted and consumed? But where is the man that lays it so to heart, as to stand up in the Gap, to make up the Hedge, so as to turn away Gods Wrath, that for a long time has burned like Fire against England, Scotland, France and Ireland: Who can stand before the Lord, who is most great, and most good, when once he is an∣gry; doth not the Mountains quake at him, and the Hills melt? And is not the Earth burnt at his Pre∣sence, yea the World, and all that dwell therein, when he pleaseth? Therefore the Wicked and all the Workers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil-doers, the Children of Disobedience, the Enemies of the Gospel, and the Protestant Religion, will be a∣shamed, confounded, and at last destroyed, if that they do not in time humble themselves under the hands of the Great and Mighty God, who is Pos∣sessor and Commander of Heaven, the Earth, and the Sea, and all things that in them be. The Righteous shall rejoyce and be glad, but the Sin∣ners in Zion, in the Church of England, will be
afraid: Fearfulness hath surprized the Hypocrites already: Who among the Sons of Men in the Church of England, that can dwell with Devour∣ing Fire? Who among them can dwell with Ever∣lasting Burnings? He that walketh Righteously, and worketh Righteousness; that speaketh up∣rightly; he that despiseth the Gain of Oppression, that slacketh his hands from holding of Bribes; that stoppeth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and shutteth his Eyes from seeing of Evil; he shall dwell on high, his place of Defence shall be the Munitions of Rocks; in time of Famine he will be fed; Bread shall be given him, his Waters shall be sure, he shall see the King in his Beauty; he will behold the Land that is very far off: But what will become of them that serve graven Images, and boast themselves of Idols? they will be a∣shamed and confounded in these Days of the Go∣spel, if that they do not loth and forsake them. In these Days of the Gospel, the Lord who is most great, and most good, most wise, and most strong, is very angry, and has been for a long time with this Generation; but most of all with the Mini∣sters of the Gospel throughout the whole Na∣tion, for not minding and regarding who hath believed their Report, and to whom the Arm of the Lord is revealed; for his Arm is very long, and very strong; and that his Enemies the Workers of Iniquity will know in these Days of the Gospel, to their great shame and overthrow. Ought not the Ministers of the Gospel to mind what they sow in weakness, in whom the Great
and the Mighty God doth raise in Power, or else they do but undervalue their own Labours, and encourage their Adversaries, who labour to un∣dermine and overthrow the Protestant Religion, His Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England. What have the Ministers of the Go∣spel to mind? Who ought they to mind more than that man whom the Lord of Hosts has made strong for himself and his Anointed; when that too many have made themselves strong in Parts a∣gainst him, and our Royal Soveraign, His Majsty of Great Britain? But what will they get but shame and confusion, for they will be brought down and that with a witness. Though it is not in the power of the Ministers of the Gospel to be∣get so Renowned a Grace, as precious Faith where it is not; yet ought it to be their great Care to countenance, incourage, and take notice of that person in whom it is wrought; because it is such a spark, that it will in time break forth into a slame, for the Glory of Gods great Name, and to put the Enemies of the Gospel to shame: It is high and honourable Work, that the God of Heaven has stirr'd me up for to make known his Mind, for the great Joy, Peace and Prosperity of Mankind. And I have endeavoured to deny my self, to over∣come my self, and to lay out my self, in so noble a Design; I have ventur'd my Life, endangered my Liberty, and have exposed my self to many Losses, Crosses, and Reproaches, to be blam'd, sham'd, and condemn'd by many men: But I had rather be condemn'd for doing well, though I do
it not so well as I should do, by the Sons of Men, than to be condemn'd by the God of Heaven, for not making known his Mind, as well as I can do: The Lord is merciful, and will pass by many Weaknesses and Infirmities of his Children; but he is just and righteous, and will punish severely them that be rebellious and disobedient: They that know their Lords will and do it not, will have stripes enough; for though the Lord be slow to anger, yet is he great in Power: They that do slight and under-value me, it is not so much me, as they do the Wisdom and the Power of the Almighty, who works with me, and in me, and for me, for the Glory of his great Name, for the Credit of his holy Gospel, for the great Ho∣nour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Exaltation of His Majesty of Great Britain, above all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World; which will bring great Joy and Triumph to the Church of England, and great Peace and Prospe∣rity to many Kingdoms; which will be brought about in these days of the Gospel, in spight of the Turk, the Pope, and the Divel, and all the Workers of Evil. It is the Power of Faith, which is the Power of God, that doth set a-work the Powers of the Soul, and the Powers of the Soul set a-work by the Powers of Heaven, will be in∣abled to prepare high and honourable Work, plea∣sant, prositable and delightsom Work, victorious, glorious, and crowning Work, to be managed by the Powers of the World, for the Glory of the
most High, and the great Honour and Renown of Englands Royal Majesty: That all Strife, Contention and Wars throughout the whole World may cease; that so among all People in all Nations, there may be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace. The Religion of the Church of Rome must not be Countenanced, Encouraged, or Tolerated a∣mong the Sons of Men, in any Nation, City, Town, or Corporation, under the Canopy of Hea∣ven, because it is a Religion full of Deceit, and throughout the whole World the greatest Cheat: It is a Religion that is an Idle Fowl, that doth at once pick the Purse, and damn the Soul: It is a Religion managed with all the Crafts of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil; therefore it is a Reli∣gion full of Pride, Vain glory, Hypocrisie, and Treachery: It is a wicked Religion, because it makes them that Conform to it, to be seven-sold more the Children of the Devil than they were by Nature. All the Sons and the Daughters of Men are bad by Nature, but the Religion of the Church of Rome makes Men worse by Practice: But, God so loved the World, that he has sent the Gospel of his Son, which is taught in the Church of England, that Men might be turned from a state of Nature, into a state of Grace; and from the power of Sin and Satan, into the Glorious Li∣berty of his Children; which is to injoy Power against Sin, and Victory over the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and all the Workers of Evil. But the Religion of the Church of Rome makes her
Children Servants to Sin, Slaves to the World and the Devil, and Enemies to their own Souls; and so being hardned in Sin by Custom and Practice, they are not afraid nor ashamed to Combine and Design from time to time, to undermine and overthrow the Protestant Religion, His Majesty of Great Britain, and the Church of England: But for ever blessed and praised be the God of Heaven, who to Admiration, from time to time has watch∣ed over this Nation, that it has not by unreasona∣ble, bloody, and deceitful Men, been brought to De∣solation; but no thanks be to them that have made a Separation, for they have done what they can to put a Sword into our Enemies hand: By their Pride and Contention, Sedition, and Rebellion, many have turned Atheists and Papists; so that the Church of Rome has been strengthned and encou∣raged from our Selves. Ever since the Church of Rome has made Shipwrack of Faith and of a good Conscience, and has preferred their Traditions, Inventions, and lying Wonders, above Gods Com∣mandments, which is the Rule of Faith and Man∣ners; their Religion has been an abominable Re∣proach unto Christ and his Gospel: They do pro∣fess Christ, but they do deny him, because they will not be ruled by his Word, nor have him rule in them by his Spirit: They do mock Christ in their Sacraments, and persecute him in his Members; so that the Religion of the Church of Rome is a bloody Religion, upheld by Tyranny and Op∣pression: The Blood that the Church of Rome has caused to be shed in the World from time to time,
by Wars, Treachery, and Cruelty; is more than there be men in England, Scotland and Ireland: And yet the Church of Rome, the Mother of Har∣lots, that Scarlet Whore, is not satisfied; but the Righteous God to whom Vengeance doth belong, though he be slow to Anger, yet is he great in Power; therefore he will give her Blood to Drink, because she is worthy: The Day of thy Calamity, O Church of Rome, is at hand; that so many Na∣tions may be freed from Slavery, and throughout the whole World there may be great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity. For thy Pride and Vain-glory, thy Formality, Hypocrisie, and Treachery, the Misery that will come upon thee, maketh hast: Therefore Cry and Howl you Inhabitants of Rome, for Antichrist must come down; and all those that will uphold his Crown: to that end the Lord of Hosts, who is Strong and Mighty in Battel, who has all Power in his own hand, and the whole Creation at command, has stirr'd me up to en∣gage with him, to stir up all the Kings and Prin∣ces in the world that will own him, to bring down his Implacable Enemies that be against him, as the Turk, the Pope, the French King, and the King of Spain, because they be Enemies to his Gospel, and his Children, who are as dear unto him as the Apple of his Eye, because they be his purchased, ransomed, and redeemed Ones, they be his justified, sanctified, chosen and beloved Ones; they be his choice Jewels, and his great Treasure: As for the Workers of Iniquity, the Seed of Evil Doers, the Children of Disobedience,
the Enemies of his Gospel; who be unbelieving Jews, bruitish Atheists, wicked and bloody Pa∣pists, and rebellious Dissentors and Sectaries, they be but Lumber and Cumber in the world, till they do Conform and Reform to the Lord of Life, who is the King of Glory, and the Prince of Peace; who knows when, how, and by whom he please, with much ease, to bring great Peace and Prospe∣rity to a Nation, as to a Person; happy be they that live to him, and live for him; they will live for ever with him; they will be in his Favour, in whose Presence is Fulness of Joy, and at whose Right Hand are Pleasures for ever-more. It is a great Priviledge to be in the Favour of an Earthly Prince; but it is the highest Honour, and the greatest Safety to be in the Favour of the God of Heaven, who is the Lord of Life and the King of Glory. A man may want Money sometimes to help himself, when he may be rich and strong in Faith to help others. A man may want Money to Trade with men, when he may be rich and strong in Faith, to engage with the God of Heaven, for the Glory of his great Name, to have his Enemies brought to shame, and His Majesly of Great. Bri∣tain, and the Church of England, throughout the whole world, to great Honour, Renown, and Fame: True Faith, which is more precious than Gold, will make a man seeming poor, to make others really rich; and it will inable a man to make himself in the world of no Reputation, to bring others to great Honour and Exaltation: Let all
that want so rich a Jewel as precious Faith, la∣bour to get it from the Lord of Life, in the use of those means that he has appointed, and the Church of England has ordained; and they that have it, let them labour to prove it, and improve it, because it will innoble the Mind, and inable the Mind to frame some noble Design, and to bring it about in due time, for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind. It has been want of Faith and Love to God, our Brethren, and Enemies, that has caused so much Strife and Con∣tention, Sedition, and Rebellion; which has brought great Disorder and Confusion from time to time among Mankind: But the God of Wisdom and Power knows when and how for to bring a∣mong the Sons of Men, in many Nations, Order out of Confusion, Light out of Darkness, Good out of Evil, Peace out of Trouble in the worst of Times; and by the weakest of Means: that Strife, Contentions, and Wars throughout the whole Earth may cease: All People in all Nations must strive to live in Love and Peace, because God is Love, who is the Creator of all Men, and the Preserver of them. That this may be done, and well done, the Gospel, that bringeth Glad-tydings of Salvation, must Run and be Glorified, where it is not, and must flourish where it is; that so they that do not know the true God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent, may labour to know him; and they that know him, let them labour to love him; and they that love him, let them labour to keep his
Commandments, because they be not grievous, but most pleasant, profitable, and comfortable: But the Traditions of the Church of Rome are burdensom, unprofitable, and uncomfortable; they do deprive Kings of their Priviledges: And that is the greatest Freedom, which is the Free∣dom of the Mind, and the greatest Liberty which is the Liberty of the Will, and the greatest Power which is over Sin, the World, and the Devil. The Church of Rome is too cruel to her Children, be∣cause she will not let them injoy the Jewels more worth than three Kingdoms: And that is a sound Heart which is the life of the Flesh; a wholsom Tongue which is a Tree of Life, and righteous Lips which are the Delight of Kings; but to lye, slatter, and dissemble, is the Church of Rome's Religion. The Lips of Truth will be establisht for ever, but a lying Tongue is but for a mo∣ment. Times may be so bad, and so sad, that many may be brought into such great straights, that they cannot tell how to live well by their Estates, or their Trades, by their Houses or Lands, or Offices, or great Places; but in the worst of Times that can come, the Just shall live by his Faith, because it is more precious than Gold: In time of Famine he will be fed, in time of Plague he will be hid, in time of War he will not fly, in time of Fire he is provided for all Eternity; when the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the Earth, and all the Works that are therein shall be burnt up, then the Just and Righteous have
an Inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for them. Faith that works by Love, will inable the Sons and the Daughters of Men to bear much, to suf∣fer much, to want much, and to enjoy much, and to do much good in their Generation; for the great Honour of God, the King, and Nation; they that can love the God of Heaven for himself, will serve him for his Kingdom; and they will know that the God of Heaven loves them, but not for what they have done and suffered, but he loves them for his Son, and for what he has done and suffered: They that do love God for Christ, and the Lord Christ as God and Man in one Per∣son, will find that the Father and the Son will manifest themselves unto them; and by their Spi∣rit will revive, refresh, counsel, comfort, and strengthen them in every State and Condition, under every Tryal, Trouble, and Affliction, that the Sons and the Daughters of Men are exposed unto in the Wilderness of this World. The God of Heaven, who is most Great and most Good, most wise, and most strong, is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dweleth in God; and God in him; which will enable a man to bring about great and wonderful things, for the great Honour and Exaltation of a Kings Person, and the great Peace and Prosperity of many Nations. Man's loving of God, who is most good, is a Fruit of Gods loving of him, though he be very bad, but not the Cause: Gods Love to Man is
free, he don't deserve it, neither can any of the Sons and Daughters of Men merit it by all their Works and Duties: Mans love to God is a Duty, the God of Heaven doth require it, because that he is most worthy of it, to be beloved above all, and more than all: They that love the God of Hea∣ven most, will serve and honour him best; and they that honour him, he will them; to some he doth it in this World, with Honours, Riches, and a long Life; but to all that be faithful and fruit∣ful in good Works, such works that be pleasing to him, and profitable to others; he will honour in his own Kingdom with Glory, Immortality, and the Crown of Lise. O Great is the Power of Faith, which is the Power of the God of Heaven, which doth inable a weak and an unlikely man for to prepare high and honourable Work, pleasant, profitable, and delightsome Work, Victorious, Glorious, and Crowning Work; to be managed by many Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men, for the Glory of the Great and Mighty God, for the Credit of his Holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Honour and Exaltation of our Royal Soveraign his Ma∣jesty of Great Britain; above all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes, and Emperors in the World: so that we shall become the wonder of the World, and a wonder to our selves; the Desire and the Delight of Nations, the Joy of the whole Earth, and the City of the great King, for Unity, Peace and Concord, for Piety
and Vertue, for Wisdom, Power, and Strength; and for Honours, Riches, and great Glory; which will be brought about in these days of the Gospel, but not by the Power of the Sword made by Men, but by the Power of Faith, which is the Wisdom and Power of the God of Heaven: Therefore Glory be to God most high, great Joy, Peace, Prosperity, and good will towards Men on Earth, Glory and great Glory from all Men and Angels; to the most High: Great Honour and Renown, great Joy, Peace and Prosperity, is for Englands Royal Majesty: Therefore with Angels and Archangels, and all the Company of Heaven, the glorious Company of the Apostles, the goodly Fellow-ship of the Prophets, the no∣ble Army of Martyrs, the Holy Church of Christ throughout the whole World; let us all laud and magnifie, praise and glorifie the God of Heaven, the Father of an infinite Majesty, for his unspeakable Love and innumerable Mercies, from time to time bestowed on Mankind, for the sake of his beloved Son, our blessed Lord and only Saviour Jesus Christ, who ever liveth and ever loveth, and will take great Delight and Pleasure to reward them that be Wise, Faithful, Valo∣rous and Couragious to the end: But they that draw back unto Perdition, and unto the Church of Rome's Tradition; his Soul will take no pleasure in them: but they that honour him he will ho∣nour them, not onely before Mortal Men, but before his Father and Holy Angels in the highest Heavens. Therefore Glory and great Glory be to
him; and great Honour and Renown to England's Royal King, our Gracious Soveraign Charles the Second, by his Grace and Favour, his Majesty of Great Britain, above all Heathen and Popish Kings, Priests, Princes and Emperors in the World; that so all Strife, Contention and Wars throughout the whole World may cease; and a∣mong all People in all Nations there may be a free Trade, great Joy, and a lasting Peace. POSTSCRIPT. WHat the God of Heaven has promised in time for the great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity of Mankind, it will be brought about in due time; for all his Promises are true and faithful, every one more precious than Gold, or the Gold of Ophir: The Crown of Glory is in a promise; them that be faithful to the Death will he give the Crown of Life. The God of Heaven promised to send his Son, and in the fulness of time he did come, who is, and was, and ever will be, the chiefest of Ten thousands in the highest degree; and in these days of the Gospel the Lord will give unto him the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utter∣most parts of the Earth for his Porfession; for the Glory of his great Name; to have his Ene∣mies brought to shame, and many Kings and
Kingdoms, to great Honour, Renown, and Fame. To him that believes and knows he believes, all things is possible to be done that is lawful, com∣mendable, and most honourable under the Sun. By what Divine Wisdom and Power has inabled me for to make known in time for the great Honour and Exaltation of his Majesties Royal Person, and the great Joy, Peace, and Prospe∣rity of many Nations; the Reader that is In∣genious, may learn to be good, and to know when and how for to do much good in his Ge∣neration; for the great Honour of God, the King, and Nation; and that in the worst of times and before the best of Men; and that without making of many words, or having the voice much heard. These days of the Gospel are times that will try the Wisdom and the Skill, the Valour and the Courage of many Wise, Strong, Rich, and Learned Men, what they can do, and what they will do, for to bring a∣bout that noble Design, that Divine Wisdom and Power has inabled me to make known in time, for the Glory of his great Name, for the Credit of his Holy Gospel, for the great Honour and Renown of the Protestant Religion, for the great Joy and Triumph of the Church of Eng∣land; which will bring great Peace and Pro∣sperity to many Kingdoms; which is to be brought about in these days of the Gospel, for the Glory of the most High, and for the great Honour and Exaltation of Englands Royal Ma∣jesty; that so many Nations may be freed from
Slavery, and throughout the whole World there may be great Joy, Peace, and Prosperity. The great and the mighty God, who is most Wise and most Strong, doth what whatsoever will, in the Heavens above and in the Farth beneath; and that when he please and with whom he please: and that many great and mighty Kings have found. I shall name but two or three, and that is King Pharaoh, King Belshazzar, and that great King Nebuchad-nezzar, who in the midst of his Glory, and in his Royal Palace of Babel, that he built for the House of the Kingdom, who was boasting of his Power, and the great Honour of his Majesty; while the word was in the Kings Mouth, a Voice came down from Heaven, saying, O King Nebuchad-nezzar; to him it was spoken that his Kingdom was de∣parted from him, and that he should be driven from Men, and that his Dwelling should be with the Beasts of the Field, and that he should eat Grass as the Oxen; and seven times should pass over him, until he did know that the most High beareth Rule over the Kingdoms of Men, and giveth them unto whomsoever he will; the very same hour was this thing fulfilled upon Nebuchad-nezzar, and he was driven from Men, and did eat Grass as the Oxen, and his Body was wet with the Dew of Heaven, till his Hairs were grown as Eagles Feathers, and his Nails like Birds Claws: and when the term of Seven years was accomplished, which from the
God of Heaven was prefixed; at the end of those days did Nebuchad-nezzar lift up his Eyes unto Heaven, and his Understanding was restored unto him: Then did he give thanksunto the most High, and praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose Dominion is an Everlasting Dominion and his Kingdom is from Generation to Generation; and before him all the Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing: and ac∣cording to his will he worketh in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; and none can stay his Hand, nor say unto him, What dost thou? Therefore he is to be feared a∣bove all Gods, because that he is a Wonder∣working God, a Great and a Glorious God; who can work Wonders in a Man and with a Man, either for or against a City or a King∣dom; for his Works are all Truth, and his Ways Judgments; and those that walk in Pride he is able to abase: but the Meek, Humble, and the Lowly, doth he delight in, among the Sons of Men, and will bring them in due time to great Honour and Glory in his Kingdom of Heaven. I am a Friend and a Lover of all them that are not Enemies unto themselves, as all Un∣believing Jews, Bruitish Atheists, Wicked and Bloody Papists, and Robellious Dissentors and Sectaries are, and that will not Conform Re∣form to the Lord of Life, who is the King of Glory, and the Prince of Peace, whose Service is perfect Freedom, and his Work and Reward
is most Prositable, most Honourable, most Comfortable, most Satisfying, Lasting, and Everlasting. What Divine Wisdom and Power has inabled me to make known in time for Englands Informa∣tion, Reformation, great Joy, Peace, and Consolation, and for her great Honour and Ex∣altation, it is by John Varney, a Member of the Church of England, and of the City of Lon∣don, a City, that has been a City of Re∣nown, and will come to greater Honour, Re∣nown and Fame, in his Majesties Royal Reign, than any City under the Heaven, is or has been since England has injoyed a King.
