TO THE READER, HAving often heard and read of the Nine Worthies, and not meeting with any par∣ticular Relation of them, I thought it might be worth my while to search out who they were, and found that the Ancients celebrated the memory of nine Renowned Persons, for the most Worthy Hero's in the Ages wherein they lived. Three whereof were Gentiles, Hector Son of Priamus King of Troy, Alexander the Great King of Ma∣cedon and Conqueror of the World, and Julius Caesar the first Emperor of Rome. Three were Jews, Joshua Captain General and Leader of the Hebrews into the Land of Canaan, David King of Israel, and Judas Maccabeus a Vali∣ant Jewish Champion against the Tyranny of An∣tiochus. And the last three were Christians, Arthur the famous King  Bain who valiant∣ly defended his Countrey against the Saxons, Charlemaign or Charles the Great King of France and Emperor of Germany, and Godfrey of
Bulloign, called King of Jerusalem, so memora∣ble for his Gallant Atchievements in recover∣ing the Holy Land from Sarazens and In∣fidels. Having discovered their names, I next en∣deavoured to collect from the most credible and Authentick Authors, what I could meet with of the Worthy Actions, and exploits whereby they obtained the Great Title of Worthies, which I have done in as brief a method as such notable Deeds could be contained in, which I now present to my Countreymen, both for their Information and Delight, not doubting but it will be accepta∣ble, especially since a Couragious Prince of our own Nation has been dignified with this mighty Honour; If it please, as I hope it may, I shall be very well satisfied with the pains I have taken in gathering these Remarks out of other Volumi∣nous Histories.

The History of Hector of Troy, the First Worthy of the World. portrait of Hector REnowned Hector, Priams Valiant Son Deservedly the Name of Worthy won, His Countries miseries he did foresee And therefore first ingag'd unwillingly. But when his Fathers Glory call'd him forth, He then displaid his Gallantry and worth, His Thundring Arm no Graecian could withstand, All fled and trembled where he did command. At length, at unawares he lost his Life, Achilles thus betwixt them ends the strife: Troy and his Fathers House soon after fell, As Hellon and Cassandra did foretell.
THough the Poets have mingled and cor∣rupted the History of the Destruction of Troy, with their Fictions and Fables, as they have most other true Storys of former Ages, yet it is most certainly related by Ancient Histo∣rians of undoubted veracity, that the Ruin of this famous City was occasioned by means of a Wooden Horse, as is commonly believed; And that Hector the Son of King Priamus of whom we now write the Life, was a renowned and Valiant Captain, and lost his Life in de∣fece of his Father and his Country; But for the better understanding the Story, we will look farther back, and consider the original of this once Magnificent City. Troy was hertofore one of the most Noble Cour of Asia Minor, as well for its Largeness and iches, as for that renowned War, which it managed against the Armies of Greece; It was scituate in Phrygia, a Province stretching it self upon the Coast of the Aegean Sea, near the Hellespont, called now the River of Con∣stantinople, over against the Chersonesus of Thracia, and the Island Tenedos, which was not far distant from it; The River Scamander, which proceeded from Mount Ida, ran by the Walls thereof, and joining with the Rver Simois, they both together empty themselves into the Sea, near the Promontory called Sigeum. The first who built this City, and comman∣ded there in Chief, was Dardanus the Son of
the King of Corinth; When his Elder Brother was dead, a dispute arose between him and his other Brother about the Succession, part of the People favouring one, and the rest the other, but Dardanus having at length defeated and killed his Brother Jasius, He with his Favou∣rites were forced for their security, to take Shipping and fly into Phrygia, where he mar∣ried the Daughter of King Teucer, with whom he jointly reigned in that Countrey, which was then named Teuoria, and afterward Dar∣dania, by which name also the City of Troy was then called; This happened about the time that Moses left the leading of the People of Israel to Joshua, about seven hundred years before the building of the City of Rome, and six hundred and fifty years after the first foun∣dation of the Assyrian Monarchy. Dardanus left his Kingdom to his Son Erich∣thonius who begat Tros; When he was possest of the Kingdom he called the City after his own name Troja, and the Countrey round about Troas; This Tros had several Sons, the eldest was named Ganimedes, and having War with Tantalus King of Phrygia, he took his Son Ga∣nimedes Prisoner, and sent him as a present to Jupiter King of Crete (now called Candia) and this gave occasion to the Fable that Gani∣medes was ravished by Jupiter; His second Son was Assaracus, who was Father of Capys, of whom came Auchises the Favourite of Venus,
who had by him Aeneas, born upon the banks of the River Simois. But the Heir of his Crown was Ilus, who altered the name of Troy to Ilium, which he mightily inriched. Laomedon succeeded his Father Ilus, he for∣tified Troy with Walls, by the assistance of Apollo and Neptune, who being both fallen into displeasure with their Prince, and seeing themselves reduced to extream poverty in a strange Countrey, far from their possessions which were in Crete, they resolved to enter themselves into the service of King Laomedon to help to build the Walls of his City. They wrought long for this ungrateful King, but when they saw no hopes of the reward promis∣ed them with an Oath for their labours, but that he was so unworthy to refuse it, he was afflicted with many diseases, so that to be deli∣vered he was forced to expose his own Daugh∣ter Hesione to be devoured by a Sea Monster, it being required of them to deliver up a Virgin every year to be destroyed by them; The King was extreamly concerned that the Lot should fall upon his Daughter, but Hercules travelling that way came to Laomedon, and offered to de∣liver her, by destroying the Monster if the King would give him for a reward some No∣ble Horses called for their excellency, The Horses of the Sun then in his Stables in Troy. The promise was made, but perfidious Lome∣don stood not to it after Hesione was set at liber∣ty,
which so much incensed Hercules, that he besieged the City of Troy, took and plundred it, kill'd Laomedon, and carryed his Son into Captivity, who was afterward redeemed by the Trojans, and for that cause was named Priamus, which in Greek signifies Redeemed. To effect this, Hercules had the assistance of his Friends and Allies, especially of Telamon the King of Salames, and Father of Ajax; He carryed away all Laomedons wealth, with Hesione his Daughter, who was married to King Telamon. Priamus being redeemed by his Subjects, and established in the Kingdom, began to inlarge his Dominions, and to render the City of Trey far more famous than ever it was be∣fore, for he rebuilt all the Walls, adorning them with Forts and Bastions, which were then called Pergama. His Wives name was Hecuba Daughter of the King of Thracia; She had by him many Sons, as Hector, Polites, Deiphobus, Helenus the Southsayer, Troilus, Paris, and Polydorus, and three Daughters named Polyxena, Cassandra, and Creusa; His Court and Pallace were full of pomp and glory, and he lived in this prosperous Estate many years, but when he espoused the quarrels of the Asian People against Greece, thereby ingaging himself in the publick enmity of his Country, and suffered Paris to affront the Grecians, he brought up, on himself and his subjects utter Ruin and De∣struction, and was at last so unhappy to behold
with his own Eyes, the total desolation of the City of Troy, which had lasted only three hundred years, as Herodotus a faithful Histo∣rian hath related. When Hecuba was with Child of Paris, she dreamed she was bringing into the World a Fire∣brand, that should kindle the flames of War in that Countrey, and cause a general Destructi∣on therein. It was the custom of the Hea∣thens, when any strange accident happen'd to consult the Oracles, and enquire from them what they ought to do; When Priamus there∣fore understood his Wives Dream, he sent to take advice with the Oracle, who informed him that this Child would be the cause of the Ruin of his Countrey: To prevent this, as soon as he was born, the King delivered him into the hands of a Souldier named Archelaus, that he might cast him into the woods to be devoured of the Wilde Beasts, and thereby avoid the mischief which threatned his King∣dom; But the Mother seeing the Child so beautiful, and well shaped, was moved with compassion & sent him to Mount Ida to the Kings Shepherd, where he was brought up as his Son, this mean education did not take from him the generous qualities and inclinations which he had received from his illustrious birth, for on every occasion, he made appear to all the World a great Courage, Prudence, and Justice, and all other virtues worthy of a Prince, so that he
proved as Valiant as he was handsome; Inso∣much that the Poets feigned, Juno, Pallas, and Venus agreed to chuse him sole Arbitrator and Judge of their Concerns in a difference between them, which was this. At the Marriage of Peleus and Thetis, whilst these Goddesses were merry at the Feast, the Goddess of Discord, cast into the middle of the Company a Golden Apple with this Inscription; For the Fairest and most Beautiful. Each of these Ladies claimed it as their own, and because they could not agree, they resolved to leave it to the judgment of Paris, who was corrupted with the Charms and Promises of Venus; For she had ingaged to procure him the handsomest Lady in the World, whereupon he despised the Riches of Juno, and the Wisdom of Pallas, and pronounced his sentence in favour of Venus, whereby he provoked the Wrath of these God∣desses against himself and all his Nation. This is the Fable. After in a Publick Assembly he declared who he was; for the Nobles and Gentry of the Countrey being met near the City to see the sport of Wrastling, when every one strove to express his Strength and Courage, he likewise went forth, and threw to the ground many who undertook to ingage with him; Hector the Son of Priamus among the rest did try his strength, and was also overcome; But this dis∣grace so inraged him against Paris, that he
resolv'd to kill him, esteeming him no better than a Countrey Clown. In his Anger he had taken away his Life had not Paris to prevent it, shewn him certain small Jewels which Queen Hecuba his Mother had delivered to the Shep∣herd his Tutor, and thereby declared himself to be his Brother. King Priamus who had al∣ready admired his Address and Courage in the Combats, was ravished with joy to understand the strange preservation of such an Excellent Son; He therefore imbraced him, brought him to his Pallace, and gave him a Train of Attendants suitable to his Quality, having forgot the Ora∣cle foretold he was to be ruin of his Kingdom and Country. He was at first renowned for his Justice and Civil behaviour, but vice overcame his Generous Disposition, and the Pleasures of the Court and sudden change of his condition altered his Temper and Carriage, so that he had two natural Sons by Oenone, Daphnis and Ideus who were as obscure as their Father was Famous. King Priamus thinking himself now strong enough to encounter his old Enemies the Graeci∣ans, assembled his Nobility to Court, to whom he spake to this purpose, My Lords, You cannot forget the cruel injuries we have undeservedly re∣ceived from the Greeks, who lately invaded our Countrey, and barbarously murdered your Parents and Friends as well as mine; Having likewise carried away Captive Hesione my most Fair and Beloved Sister, whom they still retain among them
as a common Strumpet; You must needs remem∣ber how they battered down this Famous City, overthrowing and ruining the Walls, Houses, and Pallaces thereof even to the very ground, and rob∣bed us of all our Riches and Wealth wherewith Troy did then abound. I therefore think it very just and reasonable that, by the assistance of the Gods who resist the Proud and Insolent, we ought to join together, and endeavonr to take venge∣ance of them for those many wrongs we have re∣ceived, since our City is now so well peopled with valiant Soldiers, and that we have Arms and Riches enough to furnish a compleat Army. You know likewise we have made Alliances with di∣vers great Princes our Neighbours, who no doubt will assist us if we should have occasion for their help. So that my opinion is, we ought now to seek Redress for all our wrongs; But since the fortune of War is uncertain, and none call tell the Event thereof; and though the dishonour of my Noble Sister be a very great Affront to me, yet before I begin the War, I will send some Prudent Person fairly to demand the Restitution of Hesione, which if granted, I will be content to remit all their other Affronts. The whole Council approved of this his Re∣solution, and Anthenor one of his Princes was instantly dispatcht to Salamine to King Telamon, and being admitted into his presence he thus Addressed him; Sir, Priamus King of Troy hath sent me to your Highness to desire you would please
to restore him his Sister Hesione, whom contrary to the Laws of Honour you detain as your Concu∣bine, it being no way proper to your glory thus to abuse the Daughter and Sister of a King, who issues from a more Noble Family than your self. Yet if you please to send her back, my Mas∣ter is willing to pass by all other Indignities and Damages, which he hath received from you or yours. King Telamon upon hearing this Message fell into an extreme Passion, and fiercely replyed, Friend, whatever you are, I cannot but much ad∣mire at the weakness of Priamus, with whom I have no Correspondence, nor Amity, and whom I have not the least cause to fear, nor grant his request. Thy King ought to remember that I and others my Confederates came into his Country to revenge an injury which his Father Laomedon offered to some of our Allies, and because I was the first who entered the City of Troy with great danger of my Life and Effusion of my Blood, He∣sione of whom thou speakest, was bestowed upon me as the recompence of my Victory to use her at my pleasure, and since she is so Noble and Beauti∣ful a Lady, I am very unwilling to be deprived of what is so delightful to me, and whom I ob∣tained with so much pains and danger, go there∣fore and tell Priamus that he is never like to reco∣ver her but with the point of his Sword; Nei∣ther can I think that thou art a very discreet Per∣son to undertake such a Voyage with so great peril
of thy Life, and to bring such an Errand into a Countrey where thou and thy Countreymen are mortally hated, I command thee therefore to go hence with all speed as thou hopest to escape a se∣vere and cruel death. Anthenor instantly took Shipping, and carri∣ed the same Message to King Peleus, then to King Castor and Pollux, and lastly to Duke Nestor, all of them Graecian Princes, who all de∣fied Priamus with the utmost contempt and scorn, especially Nestor, who all inraged, said, Thou vile wretch were it not for my Nobility I would cause thy Tongue to be pluckt out of thy mouth for presuming to utter such things before me, and in despight of thy King would see thee torn piecemeal by Wild-Horses; Anthenor doubting he might be as good as his word, returned im∣mediately to Sea, and sailed toward Troy, where at length after many dangers he arrived in safety. And then in the Company of several Noblemen he presented himself before King Priamus, all the Barons of the Realm, and all the Kings Sons being present to hear what Tydings he brought; To whom Anthenor gave a full Account of his Embassy, and of all that happened to him du∣ring his Voyage. At the recital whereof, Pria∣mus was very much disturbed, and by their op∣probious Speeches he perceived that it was im∣possible to recover his Sister without bringing on himself the utmost force and fury of the Grae∣cians.
Soon after he again assembled his Nobility to his Palace of Ilium, to whom he thus spake, My Lords, you may remember that by your advice I sent Anthenor into Greece, to demand the re∣turn of my Sister by all fair means possible, you likewise are sensible what injurious answers they gave to my proposals, and how little they value the wrongs we have received, insomuch that they threaten us with new mischiefs, which Heaven forbid should ever fall upon us; But since we have a strong and well fortified City, and several considerable Princes firmly confederate with us, in my opinion we are in a Capacity to revenge these reiterated damages; Therefore if you think fit, we will send our Forces privately into their Coun∣treys, where finding them utterly unprovided of defence, we shall be able in some measure to right our selves upon them; Neither ought you to be discouraged because they have been lately so victo∣rious against us, since it often happens that the Con∣querors at length are vanquished by the Con∣quered. All present were satisfied with this determina∣tion, and being all dismist, he called all his Sons who were not present at the debate, to whom he again declared his intention, with tears in his eyes to this purpose; Dear Sons, you ought never to forget the death of your Grand-father Laomedon, nor the servitude of your Aunt Hesione whom the Greeks our inveterate Enemies abuse at their own pleasure, which methinks should
stir up thoughts of revenge in your minds, but if this do not move you, yet you ought to endeavour it for my Satisfaction who have brought you up with the utmost care and diligence, and who am ready to dye with sorrow and vexation in reflect∣ing on the multiplied injuries I have received from them; And thou my Wise and Valiant Son Hector, thou who art the Eldest of thy Brethren, I require thee chiefly to undertake this matter, thou shalt be the Principal Commander in executing this my will, and all the rest will gladly obey thee, yea the whole Kingdom will willingly submit to thy Conduct, whom they know to be so valiant and couragious, and therefore upon thee I must lay all the burden of this War, and discharge my self thereof, not doubting but by thy prudence and va∣lour all will be brought to an happy effect, and thy Father be revived in his old Age with the reports of thy growing glory. To this speech Hector returned this mild and discreet answer; Dear Father, and my Soveraign Lord; I am satisfied that there are none of your Sons but are sufficiently inclined to require satisfa∣ction for any wrongs offered us, or any of our Fami∣ly, & according to the quality of the Person abused so doth the injury appear greater; It is natural to men to seek redress of injuries yea the very Beasts by nature strive to do the same; Neither, Most Dear Father, is there any of your Sons who ought more sensibly to resent the Murder of our Lord and Grandfather than I who am the eldest;
But I beseech you before you undertake this enter∣prise, to consider seriously what may be the Issue and Event thereof, otherwise you may have cause to repent that ever it was begun; I speak not this out of Contradiction or Cowardise, but only to in∣duce your Highness to take mature advice and deliberation in the matter. You know that all A∣frica and Europe are Subject to the Greeks, and that they abound with stout and valiant Souldi∣ers, so that our strength in men at Arms is not comparable to theirs; Why therefore should we who live in peace and quietness disturb our own Welfare and Prosperity. Hesione is not of so much value that we should indanger all our Lives and Estates only for her sake; She hath been already a long time in Greece, and I think it were better she should spend the rest of her days, which cannot be many, in that Countrey, than that we should run such great hazards to fetch her home again. I again declare, Dread Sir, I speak not this for fear, or want of Courage, but because the chance of War is uncertain, and lest fortune by this ad∣venture should confound and destroy our Realm, or at least cause us to wish a thousand times that we had never undertaken so dangerous an Enter∣prize. When Paris heard Hector thus declare his mind, he was much concerned, and standing up say'd; Dread Lord, I beseech you hear me one word; To what ill end can this undertaking a∣gainst the Greeks possibly come? Are we not fur∣nished
with as gallant and couragious Knights as any in the World? Yes certainly, and are able to defy the greatest force can be brought against us; Go on therefore I intreat you with your design in sending some Men and Ships to Land and For∣rage in Greece, and if you please to accept of my Service I shall most readily undertake this imploy, not doubting but to do them very great damage, and to bring away some Noble Lady, by exchang∣ing of whom you  your Sister Hesi∣one without further troub Deiphobus the third Son confirmed what Paris had say'd, but Helenus the fourth, who was a Priest or Southsayer, smartly replied; Mighty Father and Soveraign, beware that the thirst of revenge do not bring up∣on you greater mischiefs; You know very well I un∣derstand and can foretel things to come, as you have often experienced, The Gods forbid that it should ever happen Paris should be sent into Greece, for if you make an assault upon them, I now de∣clare and presage, you shall see this Honourable City destroyed by them, and your Trojans and all your Children killed, be therefore perswaded not to adventure upon what will certainly end in utter desolation, with the death of your self and Queen, and we that are your Children shall not escape; For if Paris go into Greece, all these evils shall surely come upon you. The King was much disturbed at these words, and for some time all stood silent, when Troylus his youngest Son briskly answered. My noble
Lords, why are you discouraged for the words of this cowardly Priest, who you know doth as natu∣rally hate War and Fighting as he loves good eating and drinking? Who can believe that any man knows future events unless they are revealed to him by the Gods? it were then great folly in us to concern our selves about his dreams. If He∣lenus be afraid, let him go into the Temple and sing Service, and let us, Dear Lord and Father revenge by force of Arms the injuries we have received from the Greeks, send your Ships there∣fore instantly, and doubt not but your valiant Sub∣jects will procure you sufficient satisfaction from your enemies. The whole Assembly approving this advice, they broke up, and Priamus present∣ly dispatcht his two Sons Paris and Deiphobus to raise Forces in Panonia; though Cassandra his Daughter Sirnamed the Prophetess upon hearing this their resolution, like one frantick thus cryed out; O Noble City of Troy, what Fury hath moved thy Citizens to bring thee to ruin and desolation? How soon wilt thou be over∣thrown and destroyed even unto the ground? O Queen Hecuba for what crime hast thou deserved to see the lamentable death of all thy Children? Why dost thou not prevent Paris from going into Greece, which will be the cause of so many deplo∣rable mischiefs? She then ran to her Father, and drowned in tears humbly besought him by no means to proceed in this enterprize, because by her Science she certainly foresaw horrible
effects would undoubtedly follow; But nei∣ther the disswasions of Hector nor Helenus, nor the admonitions of Cassandra could prevail in the least upon the mind of Priamus, nor stagger his resolution, as if inevitable destiny had abso∣lutely designed the ruin both of himself and his Kingdom. In the Spring Paris and Deiphobus returned with three Thousand stout Soldiers, and were soon after imbarqued in twenty Ships, accom∣panied with Aeneas, Anthenor and Polidamas, and Landing at Sparta, were received by Me∣nelaus King thereof with all expressions of kind∣ness and civility, and when his Affairs did re∣quire his presence in Crete (now Candia) he left Paris at his Pallace in his absence, but the Affection of this King was requited with a notable Treason and Ingratitude; For Paris having secretly Contracted a Friendship with Helena his Queen the Sister of Castor and Pollux, and accounted then one of the greatest Beauties in the World, he Debauched her, and when he saw a favourable opportunity he rifled his Pallace, plundered the City of Argos, and car∣ried all away Captive, with Helena and her two Ladies of Honour, and at length brought them all to Troy; The next Morning he married her in the Chief Temple of that City; King Priamus received his Sons and their Booty with great joy, remembring his hard usage from the Greeks during his Captivity, and because they had ut∣terly
ruined his City in the Reign of his Father Laomedon, in hope likewise hereby to recover his Sister Hesione out of their hands. When Cassandra heard and saw the rejoicing at the Marriage of Paris, which lasted eight days throughout the whole City, she like a Frantick Woman cryed out, O unhappy Trojans, what madness is it to rejoice at this Wedding, which will bring so many evils! Your selves and your Children shall be slain, this Famous City shall be utterly destroyed; O unhappy Mothers! you shall see your sucking Babes torn in pieces before your Eyes. O most unfortunate Mother and Queen Hecuba! where wilt thou find Tears enough to weep for the Murder of thy Children. O blind and foolish people! why do you not send Helena home again, before the Swords of your Enemies be sheathed in your Bowels? do you believe that her King and Husband will not seek Revenge? Yes certainly, and woful will his vengeance be unto you. O unhappy Helena! thou wilt be the cause of sad calamities to this our Countrey. King Pria∣mus hearing her thus crying, commanded her silence, which she refusing, was cast into Pri∣son, where she continued many days; Happy had it been for him and his people too, had they believed this warning of hers, which might have prevented those desolations that will be read with pity to the end of the World. Menlaus who was at that time with King Nestor at Epirus, hearing the news of the carry∣ing
away his Wife and ruin of his City was ex∣reamly disturbed, and sent to Agamemnon King of Mycene his brother to come to him, who ar∣riving and understanding the affair, he was mightily concerned for this disgrace of Mene∣laus, which obliged him to acquaint the Princes of Greece with this notable affront, which all the Nations had received by this Action. They all agreed to consult about this business in two ge∣neral Assemblies, where it was resolved to join all their Forces together under the leading of Agamemnon, and revenge this injury, and that they should oblige themselves solemnly by Oath not to forsake the War till the Trojans had made full satisfaction for the wrongs received. Besides Agamemnon many other valiant Commanders and stout Souldiers were met to∣gether in the Graecian Army,) as Palamedes, Achilles, Ajax, Ulisses, Menelaus, Stenelus, Diomedes, Prothesilaus, Idomeneus and Nestor, who was said to be three hundred years old, and whose wise Counsel and Eloquence was very serviceable to the Greeks, for he insinuated him∣self into the minds of the Auditors so pleasantly as if honey had dropt from his mouth with his words; They wanted no kind of Instruments nor Engines of War for their assistance in a Seige; In short time all things being provided, the Graecians landed at the Isle of Tenedos three miles from Troy, where they soon got possession of the Castle, though valiantly defended by the
Trojans; After which they sent to Priamus t demand Helena, and Satisfaction for the damage they had received by Paris, and if not to assure him that sudden ruin would fall upon him. Priamus treated the Messengers very rough∣ly and returned them back with an absolute de∣nial and defiance to their General Agamemnon; Who thereupon ordered his Ships to sail imme∣diately to Troy, where being arrived they en∣deavoured to Land, but were so warmly receiv∣ed by the Trojans who were prepared for them upon the Shore, that there ensued a very bloudy Battle, so that the Greeks were sometimes forc't back almost to their Ships, but being re-inforced they pressed very hard upon the Trojans, so that a great cry arose among them, which Hector the most Noble Worthy hearing, he instantly is∣sued out of the City with fresh Forces, and meeting with Protiselaus who had that day slain a great many Trojans, he struck him dead to the ground, and then pressing forward he bore down all who stood in his way, his name being so terrible to his Enemies that none durst with∣stand him; About Evening Hector returned in∣to the City, when Achilles, landing with his Mirmidons, made a great-slaughter of the Tro∣jans, and at length all the rest of the Fleet land∣ed, though not without stout opposition from Troilus, Paris, and Deiphobus; That night the Greeks incamped in the Field, and the Trojans retired within the City, and were Besieged there∣n
by the Greeks; Next Morning Hector issued ut of the Gates with a gallant Company, when Patroclus advanced against him with all his Force, so that his Spear pierced through his Shield, but Hector with one blow cut him down, and observing his gallant Armour, was desirous of it, and alighting to seize it, was immediately incountred by King Menon with three thou∣sand men, who endeavoured to seize both him and his Horse, but Hector remounting, made his way through the thickest of his Foes, and overthrew all that opposed, and attempted the second time to take off the Armour of Patroclus when Idumeneus King of Crete came upon him with two Thousand more, who being inraged at this disappointment, made a terrible slaugh∣ter among the Greeks, striking off Heads, Legs and Arms in abundance, and killing fitteen of the most valiant Graecian Commanders with his own hand; During this skirmish King Menon carried off the Body of Patroclus to his Tent, and thereby defeated Hector of his prize to his great vexation. The Trojans hearing that Hector was un∣horsed, and in great danger of his Life, issued out with all the strength they had to his rescue, so that the Battle was renewed with more sury than ever, and Hector being earnest in fight was incompassed on all sides by the Enemy, but as his danger so his valour increased, so that like a raging Lion he brought ruin and destruction
where-ever he came, and having another Horse brought him, his own being slain under him, he revived the courage of the Trojans, who by the multitude of their Enemies were even tired out, and just ready to leave the Field; Hector endeavouring to put the Enemy to flight was hurt in the Face with an Arrow shot by King Humerus, but not without a quick revenge, for Hector instantly returned upon him, and slew him, and presently after meeting with King Menon, Ha Traytor, said he, that hinderedst me from taking the Arms of Patroclus, I will now be avenged of thee; and therewith struck him dead off his Horse. This day the Trojans had great advantage of the Greeks, and might nave put an end to the War, had not Hector unhappily met with Ajax in an Encounter, and understanding he was his Kinsman, instead of killing him as he might have done, imbraced him in his Arms, and invited him to come to Troy, and see his Kindred; Ajax subtilly an∣swered, that it was not now a convenient time, but if he had so much kindness for him as he said, he desired that for his sake the Battle might cease that day only, to which Hector readily agreed, and blowing a Horn, thereby recalled all the Trojans into the City, who had already begun to set Fire to the Graecian Ships, and had burnt them all, if they had not been prevented by this unfortunate accident. This short Truce being expired both sides soon
prepare again for Battel, and both Armies being eady, Hector assaulted Achilles, who command∣ed the Greeks, with so great force that both fell o the Earth, Hector remounted first, leaving Achilles on the ground, and fell in among the body of his Enemies whom he slew on all hands, having his armor covered with the bloud of his Opponents, Achilles recovering himself fell like∣wise with great fury upon the Trojans, and at length again encountred Hector, by whom he was again dismounted, but being soon horst again there insued a bloody duel between these two gallant Commanders, and they had certainly killed each other had they not been timely parted; The rest of the Trojan Generals be∣haved themselves with much courage, and Hector was commonly at the head of them; King Prothenor observing his advantage, came suddenly upon him and struck him to the Earth, but Hector remounting in an instant, soon dis∣patcht him, whereat the Trojans taking courage followed the Graecians so close that they fled to their Tents, whom they pursued till night prevented them, and then returned into the City. After this battle Agamemnon called a Council of War in his Tent, wherein they concluded that it was in vain to hope for success against their Enemies till the valiant Hector was killed, and therefore they desired Achilles as well for his Strength as wisdom, to undertake it; Achil∣les
readily accepted this charge, as knowing Hector to be his mortal adversary, and being willing he should dye rather by his hand than any o∣ther; Soon after the Trojans again issued out of the City, and engaged with the Greeks, in which Battle the Valiant Hector slew three of the Greek Princes, and again encountred Achilles, both of them being again dismounted by the force of their Spears, but night coming on both sides retired. In the next fight many gallant Commanders were killed, but the Trojans lost more than the Greeks; But in the seventh Battle though Hector was very much disswaded from fighting that day both by his Father Priamus, and his Wife Andromache, who seeing him Armed fell at his Feet, together with her two little Sons, humbly intreating him to disarm himself, since she had drearned the night before that if he went out that day he should certainly be slain, and said she, If you will not do it for my sake, yet have compassion on your Dear little Chil∣dren, and do not expose both them and me to a Cruel Death, or cause us by your death, to be carried into slavery in a strange Countrey: But her reasons not in the least prevailing, his Mo∣ther Queen Hecuba, and Queen Hellena, with all his Sisters came to him with tears in their Eyes, and begged him not to go out, yet all to no purpose, for taking his Horse he was just go∣ing into the fight which was already begun, when his Father Priam seizing his Horse
by the Bridle prevented him, and made him re∣turn, but he would by no means be perswaded to disarm; The Battle was very bloody to the Trajans, and by the obstinate Valour of the Greeks they were beaten back to the City Gates, and Mar∣getton one of Priamus natural Sons was slain by Achilles, which when Hector heard, he was so inraged, that putting on his helmet, he private∣ly got away into the Fight, where he soon dispatcht several of the most forward Greek Captains, and again restored the Battle by his presence, so that the Greeks lay dead on all sides; When Achilles observed Hector to make such havock of his Commanders, he concluded that all his indeavours or hopes of success would be in vain whilst Hector lived, and therefore taking a Noble Graecian with him call'd Policceus, they came upon him with the utmost fury ima∣ginable, but Hector soon dispatcht the Noble∣man; Achilles resolving to revenge his Death, assaulted him couragiously, but Hector threw a dart at him with such violence that it wound∣ed him in the thigh; Achilles retired to bind up his wound, and then returning to the Bat∣tle with a very great Spear, wherewith he vowed to be the death of Hector, he found him carrying a Graecian Prince very richly armed out of the Field, having thrown his shield behind him for his ease and thereby left his breast un∣covered; Achilles observing his advantage,
without being perceived by Hector, came sud∣denly up to him and thrust his Spear into his Body wherewith this Gallant Worthy fell in∣stantly dead to the ground; King Memnon who was present, seeing Hector slain, fell upon Achilles with his utmost force, striking him to the ground, and wounding him very dange∣rously, but his Souldiers laid him upon his Shield, and so carried him into his Tent; The Trojans were wonderfully discouraged at his death, and retired into the City with much sorrow and lamontation; But who can express the grief of his Father, Mother, Wife and Kin∣dred, they tore their garments and faces, and were for a long time as it were distracted for grief? Hector being buried with much funeral Pomp and State, the Trojans fell upon the Greeks and cut off abundance of them in revenge of his death; To conclude, there were many slain, and much blood Spilt in the frequent Sallies of the besieged, and Memnon whom the Trojans put their trust in next to Hector being likewise slain, they were much terrified yet was Achilles soon after killed by Paris, at which they began to take courage again, and express their Joy, but it lasted not long, for Pyrrhus the Son of Achilles being arrived from Greece, succeeded his Father in all his Offices, and had no less success in the Encounters although he was very young; He revenged his death upon the Trojans
in many Battles, in one of which he killed Paris. At last the besieged were so unhappy as to see their Palladium, upon which they superstitiously believed the safety of their City did depend, stolen and carryed away privately by Ulisses and Diomedes; You must know that Troy was first built by Dardania, and afterward inlarged by his great Grand-son Ilus, who named it Ilium; This Prince made his Prayer to the Gods, that they would please to give him some sign, whe∣ther they did approve of the Building this City; Immediately at his words (saith the Story) there fell down from above, the Palladium, which was an Image of three Cubits long, holding in one hand a Lance, and in the other a Spindle with a Distaff; The Statue no sooner toucht the Earth, but it began to march in the presence of the King. The Oracle afterward inform'd him, that Troy should never be taken nor de∣stroy'd whilst that remained safe; Ulisses and Diomedes stole secretly into the Citadel of Troy through a Gutter, and carried away the Palla∣dium; This caused King Priamus to come to an Agreement with the Greeks, but had no mind to restore Helena, who was Married to Deiphobus his Younger Son after the death of Paris. Aeneas and Anthenor were Commission∣ed to Treat with the Enemy, who concluded a Peace for a certain sum of Money, and a quantity of Provisions which the Trojans were to furnish the Greeks for their return home.
This Peace was but a cheat that the Greeks might sur∣prize them with less difficulty; When they raised the Siege, they pretended to leave behind them a Present for Minerva to appease her Wrath, as if they had displea∣sed her by Stealing away and prophaning the Palladium; for that purpose they caused a Wooden Horse of a Prodi∣gious bigness to be made; In the Belly of it they shut up a great many of the stoutest and ablest Soldiers of the Army, and left it before the Walls of the City, and re∣tired with their whole Forces as if for good and all, but they went no farther than the Isle of Tenedos, expecting to see the success of their Enterprize. The Besieged im∣mediately go out of their City where they had been shut up so long, they visit all the quarters of the Graecian Camp, they admire this great Wooden Horse; At length they consult whether they should carry it into their City; Some were for it, others suspected some deceit, among whom one Lacoon cast his Lance against it, but seemed to be instantly punished, for two dread∣ful Serpents immediately killed him and his two Children. This Accident caused them all to resolve to drag this Wooden Engine into Troy. But they were far more eager when they heard the Relation and discourse of one Sinon, a Fellow taught by Ʋlisses for this purpose, and taken as a spy by the Trojans, who told them, That when the Fleet was ready to set sail toward Greece, the Gods had demanded a Graecian to be sacrificed to them that the Voyage might be prosperous, and that Ʋlisses his mortal Enemy having caused the Lot to fall upon him, he was forced to run away and hide himself; Thus persisting in his dissimulation, he told them that the design of the Greeks was to reconcile themselves to the Goddess Pallas, and therefore they had dedicated unto her this Horse, which they had caused to be made so large that it might not enter within the Walls of the City, and that the Tro∣jans might not make use of it to their advantage; and to the prejudice of the Greeks. This Discourse removed out of their minds all Jealou∣sie and Suspition, and caused them to resolve to break
down a part of the City Wall to carry in this great Horse; Every one imployed himself in this Work with all their ower and diligence, and having drawn it into the midst of the City, they all departed to Drink, Dance, and make merry, wherein they continued till night, and were then overcome with Wine and Sleep; When Si∣non saw things in this posture, he opened the Belly of the Horse to let out the Soldiers who had been there shut in, and then he made a Fire to give notice to the Greek Army, who hastening back without noise, entered by the breach lately made in the Wall, and soon disperst themselves into every part of the City to burn and plun∣der it, Pyrhut went directly to the Pallace, where he Massacred King Priamus, and all his Sons, and his Daugh∣ter Polixena; The rest of the poor Inhabitants had no Quarter granted them, but were all cruclly murdered without respect to Quality, Sex or Age; And thus after ten years Siege this Famous City was destroyed and burnt to the ground, about three hundred years after it had been built by Dardanus, and about two thousand eight hundred years from the Creation of the World. Helena the occasion of all this desolation returned with her Hus∣band to Sparta, where she lived till his death. She being afterwards banished by the Sons of Menelaus, fled to Rhodes to Queen Polixena her old Acquaintance, who suffered her to be hang'd on a Tree for her Infamous and Wicked Life.
The History of Alexander the Great, the Second Worthy of the World portrait of Alexander THE Second Worthy, was Great Alexander, That Valiant Captain, and renown'd Comman∣der. He in his youth did the known World subdue And wept beeause he found no more to do. He was a Prince that had a Mighty Mind And to all Glorious Actions was inclin'd. With Thirty Thousand men he put to slight Six hundred thousand Persians, and quite Destroy'd that Potent Monarchy, which long Had Triumpht over Nations Great and Strong, Yet he who others could subdue by wine Was Conquered, and did his Life resign.
ALexander the Great was the Son of Phi∣lip, King of Macedon and Olympias; His Father after he subdued Greece, and was acknowledged their Captain General, listed the Auxiliaries of ever City, by whom he was to be assisted against any Invasion, or to lead them forth against any Nation, for it was not doubted but that the Empire of the Persians was the design of those great preparations, the number of foot were two Hundred Thousand, and fifteen Thousand Horse, besides which he had an Army of Macedonians, and another of the barbarous Nations who were conquered, and borderers upon his Kingdom. In the Spring he sent Parmenio, Amyntas and Atta∣lus, (whose Sister he had lately Married, having divorc Olympias upon suspition of incon∣tinency) into that part of Asia which was un∣der the power of the Persians; But while the Auxiliaries of Greece were drawing into a Body, he celebrated the Nuptials of Cleopatra his Daughter and Alexander whom he had made King of Epirus; The day was remarkable for the magnificence of the Two Kings, the one Marrying, the other giving his Daughter in Marriage; Neither was there wanting the de∣light of Enterludes and Masks, to the behold∣ing whereof when King Philip passed without a Guard, between the two Alexanders his own Son and his Son in Law, Pausanias one of the Nobility, being suspected by none, Killed
Philp as he was going through the croud, and made the day destined to mirth and Marriage, black with the lamentation of a funeral. This Pausanias about the fourteenth year of his age was inforced to be a Prostitute or Sodo∣mite to Attalus, to which indignity this igno∣miny was added that Attalus having afterwards brought him into the Banquet, and made him drunk, did not onely expose him to his own lust, but to all his guests, and rendred him a common laughing stock among them, which Pausanias resenting with great indignation, of∣ten complain'd of it to Philip, but finding that he was both deluded and delayed in his just complaints, & likewise that his adversary was ho∣noured with a new addition of power & great∣ness, he converted his anger against Philip him∣self, & that revenge which he could not have on his adversary he took on his unrightous Judge; Pausanias was seized and crucified for the Fact. As there were divers Nations in the army of Philip, so he being slain, there were divers agitations of minds in them; In these distra∣ctions the coming of Alexander was a Sove∣raign remedy, who in a very obliging Speech, quieted their minds, and procured to himself a very great esteem from them; He was then but twenty years old, and gave exceeding hopes of a growing Vertue; He freed the Macedonians from all Tributes whatsoever, unless a discharge from the War, wherewith they were extreamly sa∣tisfied,
declaring that they had only lost the Person but not the Vertue or valour of their King; He caused all who were guilty of his Fathers death to be slain at his Funeral; He awed many Nations who were ready to rebel, and marching privately into Greece, called the Magistrates of all the Citys to Corinth, by whom he was made General in the place of his Father, after which he proceeded in his prepa∣rations for the Persian War begun by his Father, during which he had notice that the Athenians, Lacedemonians and Thebans had revolted to the Persians by the treachery of Demosthens the O∣rator, who corrupted him with a great sum of gold; But upon Alexanders approach they soon returned again to their obedience, the Thebans only persisting, who were thereupon quick∣ly subdued, their City levelled to the ground, and their Citizens sold for Captives. Alexander being now wholly intent upon the War in Asia, put to death all his Kindred, or friends, that he imagined might nourish any aspiring thoughts; After which having drawn his Army all into one Body, he speedily imbar∣qued them, and being come within sight of Asia, inflamed with an incredible ardor of Spirit, he erected 12 Altars where he made his Vows to the Gods of War; He then divided all his Patrimony and Kingdom which he had in Ma∣cedonia and Europe amongst his Friends, alleag∣ing
That Asia was sufficient for himself. And before any of his Ships Sailed he offered Sacri∣fices, desiring Victory in this War, in which he was to be the Revenger of Greece so often invad∣ed by the Persians, whose Empire was grown Old and Ripe for change, it being now high time that the Turn should again come about when others who would use their power better should enjoy it; Neither were the resolutions of his Army less prosaging good fortune than his own, who for∣getting their Wives and Children and the War which was so far from their own Coun∣trey, assured to themselves the Persian Gold and all the riches of the East, as if already in their pos∣session. When they drew near the Asian Shoar, Alexander first threw a dart, as into an Enemies Countrey, and leaping ashoar in his Armour, vaulted twice or thrice into the Air; He there again sacrificed, praying That those Countreys might willingly receive him as King; He did the same at Ilium, upon the Tombs of those who fell in the Trojan War; Advancing afterward towards the Enemy, he made Proclamation, That none of his Souldiers should plunder, since they ought to spare their own goods, and not destroy what they came to possess; In his Army were thirty Two thousand Foot, and Four Thousand five Hundred Horse, and a Fleet of one hundred eighty two Ships; With which inconsiderable Force it may seem wonderful he durst under∣take
to overcome all the Western World, espe∣cially since his Army did not consist of stout young men in the Flower of their Youth, but chiefly of Old Souldiers, some of whom by the Laws of War, ought for their age to have been discharged from further Service, being such as served both his Father and Grand-Father, where∣by they now seem'd Select Masters of War, ra∣ther than private Souldiers, there being no File-leader who was not sixty years old, the Order of the Camp being so excellent as it appeared like the Senate of some ancient Commonwealth, therefore in the Battle no man thought of flight but of Victory, having no hope in the nimble∣ness of their Feet, but in the strength of their Arms. On the other side Darius King of Persia, con∣fident of his strength, affirmed he would have nothing done by Policy or Circumvention, since it was not suitable to his Grandeur to steal a Victory, and therefore thought it more ho∣nourable to admit the Enemy to enter his Coun∣trey, than to fall upon him on the Borders: The first Battle was in the Plain of Adrastum, where an Army of six hundred thousand Persi∣ans were overcome as much by the Policy of Alexander as the courage of the Macedons, great was the slaughter of the Enemy, whereas he lost only nine Footmen, and one Hundred and Twenty Horse, whom to incourage the rest, he caused to be honourably buried, and Statues
were erected for them as for some memorable Commanders, bestowing great Priviledges on their Relations and kindred; After this Victo∣ry, the greatest part of Asia submitted to him; He also made many Wars with the Lieutenants of Darius, whom he overcame not so much by Arms as the Terror of his name. While he was thus Victorious he understood by a Captive that a Treason was contrived a∣gainst him by Alexander Son in law to Anti∣pater (then the Kings Lieutenant in Macedo∣nia) but fearing if he should put him to death it might occasion some Tumult in Macedon, he only confined him to Prison in Bonds; After this he advanced to Gordium, scituate between both the Phrygias, which City he desired to be Master of, not so much for the plunder as be∣cause he heard that in the Temple of Jupiter which was within it, there was consecrated the Plough of Gordius, the knots of whose cords if any could unlose, the Oracle of Old had pre∣saged he should reign over all Asia; The Ori∣ginal of the Story was this; When Gordius was ploughing in this Countrey with his Oxen, great flights of Birds of all sorts flew round a∣bout him, who going to the Southsayers and Astrologers of the next City to know the mean∣ing, he met at the Gate a Virgin of admirable Beauty, and asking her whether he should go to be resolved of his doubt, she having some knowledge her self in the Art by the instructi∣ons
of her Parents told him, That the Kingdom and Government of that Countrey was presaged to him thereby, and offered him to be a companion of his good fortune by giving her self in Marriage to him; He was unwilling to refuse so fair a condi∣tion, which seemed the first felicity of his King∣dom; After this Marriage a Sedition arose a∣mong the Phrygians, and counsel being asked, what would put an end to these mischiefs, the Oracle replied, That there was a necessity of a King; And being again demanded, who he should be, answer was made; That they should make him King whom they should find with a Plough entring into Jupiters Temple; Gordeus was the man, whom they presently saluted as their King, who consecrated to Regal Majesty in that Temple the Plough, by which the King∣dom was conferred upon him. After him reigned his Son Midas, who being instructed by Or∣pheus in the Solemnities of Worshipping their Gods, he filled all Phrygia with Religion and Ce∣remonies, by which, during his life, he was thought safer than by Arms. Alexander soon took the City, and entring the Temple, inquired for the Plough, which be∣ing shewn him, when he could not discover the ends of the Cords lying hid amongst the multi∣plicity of the foldings, he gave a violent inter∣pretation to the sense of the Oracle, and cutting the cords asunder with his sword, the knots were undone, and he found the ends lying un∣discovered
in the Mystery of the Twists; Mean while he heard of Darius approach with a for∣midable Army, and fearing the danger of the Streights of Taurus, he marcht speedily over that Mountain, his Foot going five hundred Furlongs without Respite; Coming to Tarsus and being taken with the pleasant River Cydnus running through that City, he disarmed and covered with dust and sweat, threw himself into it, which was so very cold, that it caused a Chilness and benuming in every joint, which rendred him Speechless, and made his condition very dangerous, and the more because he had received letters that day from Cappadocia, that Philip his chief Physician in whom he put most confidence, was corrupted by Darius to destroy him: However the case being despe∣rate, he ordered him to prepare a potion, and having received the Cup, he delivered these Letters to him, and stedfastly beheld him as he drank the Physick, and observing no alteration in his countenance in reading them, he became more cheerful, and in four days was perfectly re∣covered. And now Darius advanced toward him with Three hundred thousand Foot, and One hundred thousand Horse, and though the multitude of his enemies did somewhat disturb him, yet when he reflected what mighty Acti∣ons and what notable Conquests over many Nations he had performed with as few men,
he resumed his former courage, but thought it necessary by no means to delay fighting least some discouragement might happen to his Sol∣diers, and therefore riding through the midst of his Troops, he by several Speeches and Ora∣tions endeavoured to confirm their valour, tel∣ing them, The World had no Souldiers compara∣ble to them, and that this one Battle would put an end to their labours, but their glory and renown would remain for ever; Darius on the other side was no less industrious, admonishing his men not to forgot the ancient Glory of the Persian Empire, and of their everlasting possession of it, which was granted them by the Immortal Gods. After this the Battle was fought with great resolution, in which both Kings were wound∣ed, and the Victory was doubtful till Darius fled, thereupon there followed a great slaugh∣ter of the Persians, threescore and ten thousand Foot, and ten thousand Horse being slain, and forty thousand taken Prisoners; Of the Mace∣dons were slain one Hundred and Thirty Foot, and one hundred and fifty Horse; Much Gold, and other rich moveables were found in the Persian Camp, and among the Captives there were the Mother and Wife of Darius, and his two Daughters, to comfort whom when A∣lexander came in person with some Souldiers, they imbracing one onother expecting present death, made a Screaking lamentation, then hum∣bling themselves to the knees of Alexander,
they desired not life, but only a reprieve till they had buried Darius; Alexander moved at their Piety, assured them he was alive, and to remove from them the fear of death, command∣ed they should be honoured as Queens, and that the daughters should chuse them Husbands according to their Quality; After which ob∣serving the riches and precious furniture of Darius, he was possest with admiration, and then first began to delight in luxurious Ban∣quets, and Feasts, and to be tempted by the Beauties of Barsinoe his Captive, on whom he begot a Son, named Hercules. But considering Darius was yet alive, he commanded Parmenio to seize upon the Persian Fleet, and sent o∣ther Commanders to take possession of some Citys in Asia, who soon delivered themselves up with vast Sums of Gold, upon the same of this great Victory. He then advanced into Sy∣ria, where many Kings of the East with Fil∣lets and Miters met him, some of whom he received as Friends, others he deprived of their Kingdoms, preferring new Kings, and among others, Abdolominus was by him chosen King of Sidonia, who before lived miserably, his only imployment being to scour Ditches and water Gardens, Alexander rejecting the Nobility least they should impute their Royalty to their birth, and not his generosity. The Citizens of Tyre sending him a weighty Crown of Gold on pretence of gratifying him,
the gift was gratefully accepted, and the Am∣bassadors were told, He would come thither him∣self, and pay his vows to Hercules; Who al∣leging he might perform that better in the Old Town of Tyre in the ancient Church, he was so incensed that he threatned utterly to de∣stroy their City, and immediately drawing his Army to the Island, was resolutely received by the Tyrians who depended on assistance from Carthage, but that failing, they were not long after surprized by Treachery and destroy∣ed; He then took Rhodes, Egypt and Cilicia upon composition, and resolved to visit the Temple of Jupiter Hamon to inquire of future events, and of his own Original, since his Mo∣ther Olympias had confessed to his Father Philip that Alexander was not begot by him, but by a vast great Serpent, and Philip a little before his death openly declared, That Alexander was not his Son, and divorced Olympias as guilty of incontinence. Alexander therefore being am∣bitious of being a God, and to free his Mother from disgrace, sent some before hand with pre∣sents to the Priests, ordering them what answers they should return, so that entring the Temple, they instantly saluted him as the Son of Hamon, who being joyful of this adoption by this Deity, commanded that Jupiter Hamon should be esteemed his Father; He then demanded, Whe∣ther full Revenge had been taken of his Fathers Murtherers. It was answered, That his Father
could neither be killed, nor dye, but the Revenge for King Philip was fully perform'd; In Answer to a third demand it was said, That both Victory in all Wars and the possession of all Lands was granted to him; His Commanders and Intimates were likewise enjoyn'd by the Priest to worship him as a God, and not as a King. From hence he was possessed with wonderful insolence and pride, altogether estranging himself from his former familiarity learnt of the Graecians and Macedonians; He then built Alexandria, and setled a Colony of Macedons there, command∣ing it should be the Chief City of Egypt. Darius flying to Babylon, sent Letters to Alexander offering him a vast sum of money for redeeming the Captive Ladies, who returned answer, That to redeem them, he must not only give his money but his Empire. Darius soon after writ again, proposing his Daughter in Marriage, and a great part of the Empire, but Alexander writ back, That he gave him only what was his own before, and commanded him to come as a Suppliant to him, and to permit the Conque∣ror to dispose of the Kingdom at his own plea∣sure; Darius hereby dispairing of Peace, pre∣pared again for War, and advanced against Alexander with four hundred thousand Foot, and one hundred thousand Horse; In his march he was informed his Wife was dead, and that Alexander had been extreamly kind to her and the rest, lamenting her death, and assisting at
her Funeral, and that he often went to comfort his Mother and Daughters, whereat he confessed; He was truly Conquered, since after so many Bat∣tles his Enemy had likewise overcome him in kindness, and that it was some comfort to him in his Misery, to be subdued by so gallant an Adver∣sary. He thereupon writ the third time to him, giving him many thanks for his Civil Respects to his Family, offering his other Daughter, and the greater part of his Kingdom, even to the River Euphrates, and thirty thousand Talents for the other Captives; Alexander answered, That giving thanks to an Enemy was superfluous, neither had he done any thing either for Flattery, fear of future events, or in hope of peace, but out of the greatness of his mind, whereby he had learnt to contend against the Forces, but not the cala∣mities of his Enemies; He promised to allow the same grants to Darius, if he would be his second, not his equal, but as the World could not be go∣verned by two Suns, no more could it endure the Government of two such great Empires in a safe condition, therefore said he, Come if you will, and this very day surrender your self to me, or else prepare for Battle the next, wherein you have no reason to promise your self any beter success than you have already found. Next day both Armies stood ready to fight, at which instant Alexander possest with too much care, fell into a deep sleep, and was hardly wak∣ed by Parmenio, and all admiring that he who
slept little, should now be overcome therewith, in so great danger, he replied, That his being delivered from a great fear was the occa∣sion of it, since now he was to fight with all the Forces of Darius at once, being before afraid the War would be delayed should the Persians have divided their Army; Before the Battle, both Armies viewed each other, the Macedons ad∣mired the multitude, greatness of Body and Beautiful Armor of their Enemies. The Persians were amazed to think how often so many thou∣sands of them had been overcome with so few Soldiers; Alexander bid his Soldiers, Not be troubled at the multitude or strength of their Enemies, but to consider this was the third time they had fought with them, and that they were never the more valiant for flying away so often, that they ought to despise an Army shining with Gold and Silver, since their Iron would soon pur∣chase it to themselves. Then both Armies in∣gaging the Macedonians in contempt of the Enemy so often conquered, threw themselves upon the Swords of their Adversaries, and the Persians desired rather manfully to dye than be again defeated, seldom more bloud was shed in any Fight; Darius seeing his Forces routed would willingly have died himself, but those next him compelled him to fly, some perswaded him to break down the Bridge of Cydnus, and stop the Enemies progress; who answered, That he would not provide for his safety so dishonour∣ably
by expesing so many thousands of his own Soldiers to the fury of the Enemy, who ought to be allowed the same way to escape which lay open to himself. Alexander was still personally present in the greatest difficulties, and where the Enemy stood firmest, he clapt in amongst them, and made the most pressing dangers more his own than his Soldiers. In this Battle he gained to himself the whole Empire of Asia in the fifth year of his reign, so happily, that none after durst Rebel, the Persians whose Empire had con∣tinued so many years, now patiently enduring the Yoke of Servitude; His Soldiers refresht, and rewarded, the Booty being so great that they were thirty days in dividing it, he found hid eleven thousand Talents, and then took Persepolis the Chief Seat of the Kingdom re∣nowned for many years, and full of the spoils of the World, which were now discovered in the destruction thereof. At this place eight hun∣dred Greeks who had been formerly taken Cap∣tive by the Persians, came to Alexander with their dismembred Bodies, desiring him as he had delivered Greece, so he would likewise them from the Cruelty of their Enemies; The King granted them to return home, but they rather chose to be seated in some Plantation there, least instead of joy they should present to their Parents the lamentable and loathed spectacle of themselves.
Mean time Darius was seized on by his own Kinsmen, and Fettered in Golden Chains in a Parthian Town called Taneas, thinking there∣by to purchase savour of the Conqueror; Alex∣ander pursuing him full speed, came to the same Town next day, and was inform'd that Darius was by night carried away in a close Waggon; Therefore ordering his Army to follow, he pursued him with only seven thousand Horse, encountring several dangers by the way, and having run many miles without gaining any Intelligence of him, he staid to refresh his Troops, when one of his Soldiers going to the next Spring, found Darius there, bleeding through many wounds, but yet alive, who observing the Soldier to be a Persian Captive he said; It was some comfort to him in his deplora∣ble Misfortunes, that he should speak to one who understood him, and should not breath forth his last words in vain; He desired him to represent to Alexander, his real sense of the many obligations received from him, which he was sorry he had not the happiness to return, since he had demeaned himself toward his Mother and Children not as an Enemy but a King, and that he was more happy in an Adversary than in his own kindred, since Alexander had spared the Lives of his near Relations, whereas his own Life was taken away by his Kinsmen to whom he had given both Life and Kingdoms, for which he should receive that recompence which was due to a Conqueror. All
the return he could make him for his repeated savours, was as a dying man to beseech the Powers above, and the Powers below, and the Gods that dispose of Scepters, to bestow upon him the Em∣pire of the whole World. For himself he desired to have rather a solemn than a sumptuous Funeral; As to his death the revenge ought to be exempla∣ry, it being not only. Alexanders but the common cause of all Kings, and would be as dishonourable as dangerous to be passed over, since hereby he might both declare his Justice, and procure his future safety, and in hope of his performing it, He gave the Soldier his right hand, the only pledge of the Faith of a King, and soon after gave up the Ghost. Alexander coming thither, and hearing this Relation, having beheld the miserable condition wherein he was, with tears lamented his death so unworthy his former gran∣deur, and commanded his Body to be Buried like a King among the Tombs of his Predecessors. Alexander after this honoured the Souldiers he lost in pursuit of Darius with great suneral expences, dividing fifteen thousand Talents a∣mong their surviving Companions; He now received Intelligence that after his departure al∣most all Greece combined to recover their liberty in his absence, the Lacedemonians leading the Van, who despising the Peace with Philip and Alexander, Agis their King became General of this War, which insurrection Antipater supprest in the beginning, though with great blood shed
on both sides, Agis making terrible slaughter of his Enemeis, and sometimes driving whole Troops before him. After the death of Darius, Alexanders Souldiers did not doubt but the War was quite finished, expecting nothing but a speedy return to their own Countrey, and in their imagination already imbraced their Wives and Children, when Alexander calling a Gene∣ral Council, declared unto them, That they had gained nothing by so many famous victories if their more Eastern Enemies were yet untouched, neither did he make War to conquer the Person, but the Empire of Darius, and that those were to be pursued who fled away, and revolted from him; Having by this speech revived the courage of his men, he subdued the Mardians and Hircanians; In this place Thalestris or Mi∣nothea Queen of the Amazons addressed her self to him, attended with three hundred Thousand Women, having travelled twenty five days through many terrible Nations, only as she sayd, To have a son by so great a Conqueror; Her countenance and the cause of her com∣ing were the subject of much wonder, both for the strangeness of her habit, and re∣quest. To satisfie which the King took thirty day; leasure, and when she thought she was with Child, she took her leave and departed. Alexander now assumed the habit, and Diadem of the King of Persia, as if tranformed into the fashions and Customs of the Conquered,
and to prevent envy, commanded his friends likewise to wear long Robes of gold and purple, and to imitate their Riot also, he divided the night by turns among troops of Concubines, ad∣mired both for birth and beauty, adding thereto Feasts and Plays to compleat his Luxury; which caused great indignation among his Commanders to see him so far degenerate from his Father Philip, that he did not care to have his own Countrey so much as mentioned, be∣ing overcome with the same vices which were the overthrow of his Enemies; yet he politick∣ly permitted his Souldiers to marry those Wo∣men who were their Captives, to make the War less tedious, and their desires to abate of returning home, and likewise that Mace∣donia might be the less exhausted with recruit if young Souldiers born in the Camp should succeed, their Old Fathers. The Parthians be∣ing next subdued, Andragoras a noble Persian was made their Govenor, from whom the Kings of Parthia deriv'd their original. In the mean time Alexander excercised his rage on his own men more like an Enemy than a King, especially on those who upbraided him for sub∣verting the Customs of his Countrey, for which offence old Permenio next in dignity to the King and his Son Philotas, though upon other pretences, were put to death; upon which, murmurs rose throughout the Camp in compassion to these innocents, and secrets
whispers that they could hope for little better to themselves; which being told Alexander, he declared he would send some into Macedonia to give an account of his Conquests, desiring his Souldiers to write freely to their Friends, who were glad of such an opportunity; This done he commanded the Letters to be secretly brought him, whereby having discovered every mans opinion of him, he reduced those who had writ severely into one Company, with an intent either to destroy or distribute them into Colonies in the furthest parts of the World. He then subdued the Dracans, and divers other Nations inhabiting at the foot of Mount Caucasus, when Bessus one of the Favorites of Darius was brought bound in chains, who not only betrayd but kill'd his King, whom Alexan∣der delivered to the brother of Darius to be tor∣mented in revenge of his Treason, And to leave his name in those remote Countreys, he built a City which he named Alexandria on the River Tanais within seventeen days, making a Wall about it of six miles compass, and transplanting thither the people of three Citys adjacent, built by Cyrus; He likewise built twelve Citys amongst the Bactrians and Sogdians, wherein he placed all whom he found seditious in his Army; After this, one Holyday he called his chief Captains together to a Banquet, where mention being made of the exploits perform'd by Phillip, Alexander
preferred himself above his Father, and extolled his own Atchievements to the skies, the great∣est part of his guests assenting thereto, but Cly∣tus an Old Commander upon confidence of the Kings Friendship, still persisted to magni∣fie the actions of Philip; which so inflam'd A∣lexander, that snatching a spear from one of the Guard, he killed him at the Feast, and insulted over his Dead body; but his Passion being a∣bated he heartily repented of that rash action, lamenting his innocent Old Friend whom Wine and Gluttony had thus destroyed, and would have done execution upon himself for the same, had not his Friends prevented him; Yet mel∣ting into tears he imbraced the dead Body, handled his wounds, and confessed to him his madness as if alive, and taking the spear again into his hands he had certainly slain himself if the attendants had not interposed. This reso∣lution to dye continued with him several days after; The remembrance of his Nurse who was Sister to Clytus still renewed his griefe, for making her so cruel a recompence for the nourishment she had given him, and that being a young man and a Conqueror he should requite her who brought him up in her arms with Bloud and Murder. He then reflected on the disgrace this act would procure him both in his own Army and the Conquered Nations, ap∣pearing now more terrible among his Friends at a Banquet than being armed in the face of
his Enemies, then Permenio and Philotas, and all the Princes he had destroyed in Macedon re∣presented themselves to his memory, for which he abstained four days from eating a bit of meat, till he was at last prevaild on by the Pray∣ers of the whole Army, desiring him not so much to resent the death of one as thereby to destroy them all, nor to forsake those whom he had brought into the utmost parts of the East among barbarous and cruel Nations, sufficient∣ly provoked by his invasions; The perswasions of Calisthenes the Philoso∣pher and his familiar acquaintance prevailed much upon him, being bred up with him in the School of Aristotle, and whom he sent for on purpose to record his Conquests and Victorys. Having therefore resolv'd to pursue the War, he took several Nations who submitted to him into his protection; Yet not long after to ren∣der himself still more hateful, he commanded, That he would not only be Worshipped but a∣dored, which was the only thing he had for∣born in his proud imitation, of the Persian Kings. Calisthenes was the most resolute oppo∣sor of this innovation, which ruined both him and divers other Princes of Macedon, who were all put to death under pretence of Treason; Yet would not the Macedons submit to adora∣tion, but retained their ancient custom of salu∣ting their King. He next marcht into India to bound his Empire with the Ocean and the
farthest East, and to make himself and his Ar∣my more renowned, he covered the trappings of their Horses, and the arms of his Souldiers with Silver; When he came to the City of Nysa, the in habitants made no resistance because of their religious confidence in the assistance of their God Bacchus, by whom that City was built, which he commanded should be spared that he might follow the footsteps of their Deity; He then led his Army to see the Holy Hill of Bac∣chus which was clothed with Vines and Ivy so naturally and elegantly as if adorned by the hand and industry of the Planter; From hence he marcht to the Hills of Dedalus and the kingdom of Queen Cleophis, who yeilding to him without resistance received back her King∣dom, redeeming it by exposing her self to his pleasure, and obtaining that by wantonness which she could never have recovered by force of Arms; She called her Son, then begotten by him, Alexander, who after enjoy'd the King∣dom of the Indians, she was afterward called by her subjects The Royal Harlot. Having marcht almost through all India, he came at length to a Rock as wonderful for its bigness as ascent, into which many Nations fled for security, and understood that Hercules was by an Earthquake hindred from taking it; Be∣ing thereupon transported with ambition to transcend the Actions and labours of Hercules, he with almost infinite difficulty and danger be∣came
came Master of it, and took into his protection all the Nations thereabout. One of the Indian Kings named Porus, was as admirable for his strength of Body as greatness of Mind, who hav∣ing notice of Alexanders advance, prepared an Army to entertain him; The Battles being joyned, he damanded of the Macedons their King, being resolved as a private Enemy to fight with him hand to hand. Alexander made no delay to answer him, and in the first encoun∣ter falling headlong to the ground, his Horse being killed under him, he was preserved by the concourse of his Guard. Porus almost cover∣ed with Bloud from the many wounds received, was taken Prisoner, and had such Indignation to be overcome, that though he had Quarter given he would receive no sustenance, nor suffer his wounds to be dressed, being with much difficulty perswaded to be contented to live. Alexander in honour of his valor sent him back safe to his own Kingdom; He erected there two Citys, one called Nicea, and the other Bucephale after the name of his Horse; He then overthrew the Armies of the Adrestians and divers other people, and marching to the Euphitans he found they attended his coming with an Army of two hundred thousand Horse, whereupon all his Souldiers being tired as well by the number of their victories as their labours, humbly besought him with tears To put a period to his Wars, and now at last to think of returning to
their Countrey, intreating him to consider the years of his Souldiers, whose age could scarce suffice to car∣ry them home again; Some shewed their grey hairs, others their Wounds, some their Bodies con∣sumed with sickness, others their loss of Bloud, which they had freely shed in continual war∣fare both with himself and Father, and therefore desired That the remains of their worn bodys might be buried in the graves of their Ancestors, and however if he would not spare them, Yet that he would spare himself, and not tempt his good Fortune by venturing it too far. Moved with these just petitions, he to give an end to his Victorys, commanded his Camp to be made exceeding mangnificent, that by the large Extent thereof the Enemy should be ter∣rified, and his fame admired in future ages; His Souldiers never undertook any thing more readily, and then falling upon their formidable enemy with all their might, they soon put that undisciplined multitude to flight, and with great Joy returned to their Quarters. From thence he marched to the River Ace∣sines, on which he saild to the Ocean, where two Nations of whom Hercules was the founder submitted to him, from whence he saild to the Sycambrians who with fourscore and three thou∣sand armed Foot, and threescore thousand Horse were ready to receive him. Having overthrown them in the Field, he came to their chief City, and being himself the first
man that scaled the Walls, when he found them unguarded, he leaped down into the City alone without any guard. The Enemy seeing him single with a great shout ran toward him from every place, hoping by the death of one man to end the Wars of all the World, and re∣venge the quarrel of so many Nations. Alexan∣der resolutely resisted them, and fought alone against so many. Thousands. It is incredible to be spoken that neither the multitude of his Foes, the fury of their weapons, nor the cries they made to incourage one another, could any way affright him, he alone kill'd and put to flight so many, but at length finding he was overpowered, he got to the body of a Tree close under the Wall, where he a long time sustained their fury, till his Soldiers understand∣ing his danger, leapt down to his assistance, many of whom were slain, and the Battle con∣tinued doubtful until the Walls being beat down, his whole Army came to his rescue. In this Fight being shot with an Arrow under the breast, he fainted with loss of Bloud, yet fought so long with one knee on the ground till he had killed two who wounded him. The cure was more grievous than the wound, but being at last recovered, though with ex∣tream difficulty, he sent Polypercan with his Army to Babylon, he himself going with a Select party aboard his Fleet to make further discovery of the Ocean, and landing at the
City of King Ambigerus, the Inhabitants be∣lieving he could not be overcome by the Sword, poisoned their Darts, wherewith they forced him from the Walls, and killed many of his Souldiers, among others Ptolomy was deadly wounded, and being ready to expire, an herb was shown to Alexander in a dream, which being found and steeped in his drink, recovered Ptolomy and the greater part of the Army; At length the City being taken, he returned to his Ships and Sacrificed to the Ocean, imploring a happy return into his Countrey, and at length arrived at the Mouth of the River Indus, where as a Monument of his Atcheivements he built the City of Barse and Erected Altars, and having left a Governor over the Indians, he marched toward Babylon, digging Wells by the way to procure fresh Water to his tired Souldiers; Hither many of the Conquered Na∣tions had sent their Ambassadors to accuse his Lieutenants of Oppression and Cruelty, whom Alexander without any respect to friend∣ship caused to be put to death in their presence. After this he Married Statyra, Darius Daugh∣ter, and gave the most noble Virgins of all Nations for Wives to his Princes, thereby to mitigate his own fault. He then called his Ar∣my together, and promised to pay all their Debts, that they might carry home all their Booty and pay entire, which munificence was re∣markable for the vastness of the Sum, Twenty
three Thousand Talents being laid out in this affair; His old Souldiers being thus sent home, the younger were much displeased, and began to mutiny that they had not the same favour, some of whom Alexander chastized, and perswaded others, but at length finding words would not prevail, he leapt unarmed from his Throne, among the Armed multitude, and seizing twelve of the chief Authors of the Sedition, hurried them to Execution, none daring to offer the least resistance. Calling then together the Persian Souldiers, he extolled their constant fi∣delity both to himself and their former Kings, and declarcd he would now commit himself to their Custody and no longer to the Mace∣dons; And accordingly chose a thousand of them for his Life-Guard, mingling also se∣veral Regiments of Persians among his Mace∣dons to learn their discipline, which his Army took so much to heart, that all weeping they repaired to him, beseeching him rather to pu∣nish them than to put such a severe affront upon them, by which submission they prevailed so far that he dismist and sent back to Macedo∣nia Eleven thousand of his Old Souldiers, and their pay was continued to them in their return as if they had still served. At this time Ephestion one of his Favourites, both for his Beauty, Youth, and Wisdom died, whom Alexander below the dignity of a King, lamented a long time, erecting him a Tomb
which cost twelve thousand Talents, and com∣manding him to be worshiped as a God. Returning to Babylon from the furthest Coasts of the Ocean, he had notice that Am∣bassadors from Carthage and other Cities in Africa, as also from Spain, Sicily, France, Sar∣dinia, and divers Cities in Italy, attended his Arrival, the Terror of his name having so possest the World, that all Nations submitted to him as a King destin'd to be their Ruler. For this cause, approaching Babylon to keep as it were a Parliament of the whole World, some Magicians advised him not to enter that City, affirming it would be fatal to him, therefore declining it, he turn'd aside to Bersia, a City heretofore unpeopled on the other side Euphrates where he was importuned by Anaxarchus the Philosopher to despise the Presages of the Ma∣gicians as false and uncertain, and if proceed∣ing from Destiny or Nature not to be prevent∣ed. Going therefore to Babylon, after a while he again prepared a Solemn Feast, which he had for some time intermitted, where he devoted himself absolutely to mirth, both day and night; After which Thessalus his Physician invited him and his Companions to another debauch, where taking the Cup into his hand, in the middle of his draught, he groaned as if he had been struck through with a Sword, and his Body became so extream tender that he complained if but touched, as though he had
been wounded; His Friends said, his disease was occasioned by excess of Wine, though it were really Treason, the infamy whereof the power of his Successors did suppress. The Author of this Treason was Antipater, who when he beheld his dearest friends commanded to death, his Son in law slain, and himself who had performed such considerable Service in Greece disrespected, and accused by his Mother Olympias of many insolencies, and likewise con∣sidered his late severity to his Lieutenants, and expected the same treatment, to make sure work with the King, he suborned his son Cas∣sender, with his Brother Philip and Jolla, who used to minister to him, to poison him; So great was the strength of the Poyson, that it could not be contained in Iron, Brass, nor any thing but a Horses hoof, Cassander was bid to in∣trust none but Thestalus, so that when the Feast was in his house, after Philip hast tasted the Kings Cup, having the poyson ready in cold Water, they put it into the Wine; Four days after Alexander finding Death cer∣tainly approaching, said, He believed it was the fate of his Family to dye about thirty years Old. After which he pacified his Souldiers who were ready to mutiny, suspecting he perisht by Trea∣son, being therefore brought into the highest place of the City, he admitted all into his presence, and gave them his right hand to kiss, and when all wept, he appear'd without the least trouble,
comforting those who impatiently lamented, his courage being now as invincible against death as formerly against his Enemies. The Souldiers departing, he askt his Friends about him, If they thought they should have another King like him. When all holding their Peace, he confidently presaged as if he had seen it with his Eyes, That Macedon should lose much bloud in his quarrel, and many Thousand Lives would be sacrificed at his Funeral; He then command∣ed his Body to be buried in the Temple of Ju∣piter Hammon, and then fainting away, his Attendants demanded whom he would consti∣tute heir of his Empire, he only, answered, To the most Worthy; So great was the vigor of his mind, that though he left behind him his Son Hercules, his Brother Arideus, and his Wife Roxane big with Child, yet forgetting those Obligations, he only nominated, The most Wor∣thy to be his Heir, as if it were unreasonable that any but a valiant man should succeed a Conqueror. With these words, as if the Spirit of Discord had been sent among them, his chief Captains instantly grew jealous of each other, and privately sought to gain the favour of the Soldiers to themselves; On the sixth day being Speechless, he gave his Ring off his Finger to Perdccas, which for the present pacified the growing dissentions, for though by voice he was not nominated Heir, yet by choice he seem∣ed to be so, Alexander deceased being Thirty
three years and one mouth Old, a man endewed with a mighty Spirit above other men, whose Mother Olym∣pias dream't when he was conceived that she had com∣merce with a God, and by his Actions he after seemed to be above the condition of Mortal men; There appear∣ed also many Presages of his future greatness on his Birth-day, for two Eagles flying all that day round a∣bout the Palace, setled at last upon the battlements of his Fathers Court, seeming to prognosticate to him the two Empires of Europe and Asia, and on the same day his Father received the glad tydings of two Victories, one in Illyria, and another in the Olympick race, whither he sent some Charlots drawn with four Horses, which portended to the Infant the Victory over all the World. He was of admirable apprehension and learning, and was educated under Aristotle the most famous Philosopher. Being invested in his Fathers kingdom, he commanded him∣self to be called, King of all Countreys, and Lord of the World; So great a confidence had his Souldiers in his good for∣tune, that he being present they scared not, though unarmed, the force of any Enemy; He never en∣countred any Adversary whom he did not overcome, nor besieged any City which he did not take, nor invaded any Nation over whom he did not Triumph, and there∣fore deservedly gain'd the name of Alexander the Great, and one of the Worthies of the World. Yet was this Great Conqueror at length destroyed not by the valour of his Enemies, but the Villany and Treason of his own Friends and Subjects. He lived in the Year of the World 3611, before Christ 337 years.
The History of Julius Caesar first Emperor of Rome, The Third Worthy of the World. portrait of Julius Caesar GReat Julius Caesar next attain'd the Name Of the Third Worthy; Whose immortal Fame Remains still fresh in the Records of time, He to the Empire of the World did clime, And what he Conquer'd by his Sword in Fight He with his Pen did elegantly write, At length through many wounds his Soul hence fled And he who ner'e before was Conquered In War; He who with slaughter strew'd So many Lands; With his own bloud imbru'd The Seat of wronged Justice; And fell down A Sacrifice t' appease the incensed Gown.
Julius Caesar of the Noble Family of the Juli so called as some think from Julus As∣canius the Son of Aeneas, from whom they were ambitious to have descended, and Caesar, because it is said, he was cut out of his Mothers Womb, though others derive it a Caeso Ele∣phanto, from his Grandfathers, killing an Ele∣phant; He was but Sixteen years old when his Father died, and yet was designed the next year to be High-Priest of Jupiter, and having divorced himself from his first wife, whose birth was not so eminent as his Fortune, he married Cornelia, daughter of Cinna who had been four times Consul, by whom he had his daughter Julia; Sylla used all possible arguments to have separated him from her, but not prevailing, he pursued him as an Enemy, and designed to arrest him; At length by the intercession of the Vestal Virgins and some of his kinsmen, he obtained pardon, though Sylla then cryed out by way of prediction, Take him then since you will needs have him, but know the person for whom you have been so zealous will be the de∣struction of the Nobility and Common Interest we have so earnestly defended, for I assure you there are in Caesar many Marii or disturbers of their Coun∣trey; He first bore arms in Asia as a Voluntier, and afterward in Cilicia, but hearing of Sylla's death, and hoping for new troubles from the discontents of M. Lepidus, he return'd to Rome, where he accused C. Dolabella of ex∣tortion,
but unable to make good his charge, and Dolabella acquit, he withdrew to Rhodes both to avoid envy, and to study more private∣ly under A. Molon the most celebrated Orator of those times. In his passage he was taken by Pyrates in whose hands he continued forty days with great perturbation of mind with on∣ly his Physician, and two servants, having sent a∣way the rest to procure his ransom, who bring∣ing fifty Talents, he was set ashoar; to recom∣pence their kindness, he puts immediately again to Sea, pursues, overtakes and executes these Robbers, as he had often threatned them in jest when he was their Prisoner. In the mean time Mithridates making great devastation in the neighbouring Countreys, Caesar thinking it dishonourable to lye still while his Allies were in distress, he past from Rhodes to Asia, and raising what Forces he could, beat Mithridates Governor out of those Provinces, and confirmed several in their alle∣giance who before were inclining to revolt. The first dignity bestow'd on him by the People was to be Tribune, which Office he strenuously main∣tained. Being Quester he made Funeral Ora∣tions, according to custom, in praise of Julia his Aunt, and Cornelia his Wife, wherein he speaks thus of his Extraction. My Aunt Julia by the Mothers side was descended from Kings, and by the Fathers she was allied to the Gods, for from Ancius Marcius the Marcij, who were called
Reges or Kings are derived, and the Ju were derived from Venus. In our House there fore we have the Majesty of Kings, who are th most potent among men, and the Veneration  the Gods, who are more powerful than they. A Questor the Government of the furthest part o Spain fell to his Lot, and going his Circuit t keep Courts of Justice, he came to Cadez, whe observing the Image of Alexander in the Tem ple of Hercules, he fetcht a deep sigh for having done nothing remarkable at that Age wherei he had Conquered the World; Upon which contemplation he beg'd to be immediately dis∣mist designing for Rome to attend some greate Enterprize. He likewise dreamed the Night before, that he had ravished his Mother, and was extreamly exalted when the Interprete told him it was a presage of his Dominion over the whole Earth, since the Mother which seem'd to be violated could be nothing but the Earth the common Mother of all. Departing therefore out of Spain before his Commission was expired, he went amongst the Latin Colonies who were at that time pressing for their Freedom, and if not prevented, had certainly excited them to Sedition. Yet this did not discourage him, for being made Aedil, he was suspected of Conspiracy with M. Crassus, Sylla and Antonius, their design was to have set upon the Senate, and having cut the Throats of such as they thought convenient, Crassus was
o have been Dictator, and Caesar, Master of he Horse, and the Republick to be setled ac∣ording to their contrivance, but at the day ppointed either for fear or remorse, Crassus bsenting himself, their Plot was not Executed. n his Aedilship he beautified the Market-places nd Halls of Justice, and adorned the Capitol with Galleries, that From thence the common People might be spectators of the Baiting of wild Beasts, Stage-Plays, and such other diver∣ions as might insinuate his generosity toward hem; To which were added Sword-Players n so great numbers, that his Enemies alarum'd t their multitude, published an Edict to re∣train them to a certain number; having here∣y obliged the People, he intended to get the Government of Egypt to himself by their Act, and when the Nobility prevented him therein, he was much disturb'd; Yet by his liberality he soon after obtained the Office of High-Priest, which he managed with extravagant profuse∣ess. The Conspiracy of Cataline being discover∣ed, and the Senate generally condemning him and his Accomplices to death, Caesar only was the man who endeavoured to moderate the Sen∣tence into Imprisonment and Confiscation, which he prest with so much heat, that had not Cato's Oration recollected them, the whole Senate had complied. Yet he afterward oppo∣sed the Execution of the Decree, with that ob∣stinacy,
that he was threatned to be kill'd by the Guards, who set their Swords to his Throat, and frightned him into compliance. He next asserted some Priviledges in behalf of the Peo∣ple contrary to the mind of the Senate, who thereupon forbid him to proceed in executing them, of which he took no notice but went on, till some Soldiers were ordered to interrupt him; Then he dismist his Officers, and laid by his Purple Robe, retiring privately to his own House, as if submitting to the iniquity of that time. Two days after the People came to him in great throngs, and in a tumultuous way of∣fered him their assistance, but he appeased them beyond all expectation, and the Senate (who suddenly met about that Commotion) sent him thanks by some Principal Persons; He was also re-invited into the Senate, commended, re∣stor'd, and the Decree for his suspension re∣voked. He fell again into some trouble upon an ac∣cusation of being concern'd in Catalines Con∣spiracy, but appealing to the Testimony of Cicero, he was cleered of it, and his Accuser fined, his goods seized, and himself almost torn in pieces by the People. In a short time he was made Consul with Bibulus, and some affronts being put upon him by the Senate, he contrac∣ted a strict Friendship with Pompey, at that time at defiance with the Senate, to whom he reconciled Crassus, and joining all together, no∣thing
for the future could be transacted in the State but by the consent of all three. After his promotion to the Consulship, a Law called Lex Agraria being propounded, and his Com∣panion Bibulus protesting against it, Caesar vio∣lently drove him out of the place, and finding upon his complaint of that violence, that none of the Senate durst move in his behalf, in utter despair he retired immediately to his House where he continued all the rest of his Consul∣ship, so that now Caesar had the sole adminis∣tration of Affairs, which he managed with that uncontroulable arbitrariness, that some merry Citizens upon subscribing any Will or Record writ thus, Not when Caesar and Bibulus, but when Julius and Caesar were Consuls, and these Verses were dispersed. Non Bibulo quidquam, &c. All things of late Great Caesar acts alone, Poor Bibulus is out of Fashion grown. Upon all occasions he extended his power to the utmost; The Farmers of the Revenues pe∣titioning for abatement because of the hardness of their Bargain, he abated them a third part, admonishing them to bid more warily for the future. He caused Cato to be halled violently out of the Senate and committed, for only inter∣rupting him, and others were made sensible of his least displeasure. He then married Calphur∣nia the Daughter of Piso, by which alliance
he still grew greater, and had a Triumph a lowed him for conquering Gallia now Fran with which advancement he was so elated tha a while after in a full Assembly he boasted  had laid his Enemies on their backs. His at∣chievements during the nine years wherein  had the principal command of the Army we generally these. He reduced into a Province tha part of France which lies between the Pyrenea Mountains, the Alps, the Mountains Gerbenn the Rhyne and the Rhosne, containing thr thousand two hundred Miles in circumference imposing a vast Tribute upon all the grea Towns and Cities; He was the first of all th Romans who built a Bridge over the Rhin assailed the Germans on the other side the Rive and gave them several considerable defeats He invaded the Brittains likewise, who wer till then unknown, and having over-run them in a short time; forced them to give him Hos∣tages and Contribution; Amongst all the Va∣riety and Greatness of his Enterprizes, he ne∣ver had ill fortune but thrice. First upon the Coasts of Brittain, where his whole Fleet had like to have miscarried by storm; The Se∣cond in France where one of his Legions was intirely cut off, and the third on the Fron∣tiers of Germany, where two of his Lieute∣nants were circumvented by an Ambuscade and defeated. At this time the Commonwealth was in
great consternation, and the Senate resolving o create but one Consul which should be Pom∣ey, Caesar prevailed with the Tribunes who were endeavouring to make him his Colleague, that they should propose to the People, That in respect of his absence upon Publick affairs they would make him capable of being chosen again when his Consulship was out, lst otherwise he should be constrained to leave the Wars he had so prosperously begun, unfinished; Having succeed∣ed in his desires, his hopes were inlarged with his Designs, there was no kind of Bounty or Mu∣nificence which he omitted to all people; He began to build the Town-Hall with the Spoils of his Enemies, paying a vast Sum for the Ground; and having published a solemn Sword-play, and made a Feast to the People in memory of his Daughter, he not only im∣ployed all the Cooks and Victuallers of the City to provide what they could get, but made vast preparations likewise at home; He doubled the pay of his Souldiers forever; He endeavour∣ed to continue his friendship with Pompey by promising him Octavia his sisters Grandaughter in Marriage; He obliged all Persons about Pompey, and most of the Senators either by giving or lending them mony, upon very rea∣sonable Terms; He ingratiated himself with the rest by frequent invitations or noble Presents, not forgetting to let their Servants partake of his bounty according to their interest with their
Masters. All Criminals, Debtors and Prodigal had their Sanctuary in him, provided their Crimes, Debts and Necessities were not beyond his relief, in which case he used plainly to tell them, They had nothing to pray for but a Civil War. Nor was he less studious in insinuating into Forreign Princes and Provinces; To some he would make Presents of a thousand Prisoners at once; To others he would send as many and great supplies as he pleased without consent or Authority of Senate or People. He likewise beautified and adorned the most eminent Cities in Italy, France, Spain, Asia, and Greece with their most considerable Buildings; Till at length all being amazed to see whither these things should tend, Mrcellus the Consul proposed to the Senate to name a Successor to Caesar before his time was expired, because the War being finished and Peace restored, it would be conve∣nient to disband the Army, which was accord∣ly done, though opposed by the Tribunes, and Caesar was likewise deprived of the Provinces over which he was Governor; Caesar being netled at the fierce opposition against him, hum∣bly addrest to the Senate, That either that Fa∣vour and Priviledge of the people might be made good to him, or that all other Generals might lay down their Commands; intending thereby that Pompey the Senates General should dismiss his Forces, and hoping that he could afterward
sooner raise a new Army than Pompey. But the Senate not thinking it fit to capitulate with a Subject, Caesar went into the lower part of France, resolving to oppose with his Sword whatever Decree the Senate should make against the intercession of the Tribunes of the Peo∣ple who were of his Party, and this was his pretence for the Bloody Civil Wars that fol∣lowed, though Pompey use to say; That not being able to finish these publick Buildings which he had begun with so much magnifi∣cence, nor to satisfy the expectations of the Peo∣ple with his private Estate, he resolved to put all things into confusion. Others say, he was jealous of being questioned for what he had done illegally in his first Consulship, contrary to the Laws and Remonstrances of the Tri∣buns; and the rather because Cato had so∣lemnly sworn to impeach him as soon as ever he parted from his Army, and it was gene∣rally said, That if he return'd as a private Per∣so, they would handle him as they did Milo, and make him answer before the Judges with strong Guards about him, which seems the more probable by what he said at the Battle of Phar∣salia when he saw his Adversaries run, This is their own doings, I my self must have been con∣demned after so many Noble exploits had I not beg'd the assistance of my Army; Some said that having been so long used to command, and cunningly computing his own and Enemies
power, he laid hold of that occasion to usurp that power which he had long before designed since he had often in his Mouth two Verses of Euripedes. Nam si violandum est jus, &c. Ne're stand on Justice when the Stake's a Crown, In lesser things pretend Religion. When he had Intelligence that the intercession of the Tribunes was ineffectual, and that they were gone out of Rome, he made bold with a Bakers Mules, and instantly clapt them into his Charriot, and after Sun-set travelled with great privacy through by-lanes to his Troops on the Banks of Rubicon, whither being come, he stood still a while ruinating upon the Enter∣prize he was undertaking, at last turning to those next him, he said, Thus far we are safe, and may return if we please, if we pass but this Bridge me shall have nothing to trust to but our Arms. While he stood doubting, there appeared to him a Person of a Remarkable Stature and Beauty sitting hard by him, and playing upon a Reed, not only the Shepherds, but several of the Souldiers ran to hear him, and some Trum∣peters among the rest, which being observ∣ed by this Piper, he suddenly snatch a Trumpet out of one of their hands, and leaping instantly into the Water, he sounded a charge which he continued to the other side of the River with such loudness as made the Earth tremble again;
Upon which Caesar cryed out; Come then, it is decreed, let us go whither the Prodigies of the Gods, and the Iniquity of our Enemies leads us. Having passed his Army over the River, and joined with the Tribunes of the People, who being expelled out of the City, retired to him; He made an Oration to his Souldiers, and with Tears in his Eyes implor'd their Fidelity and Assistance, affirming he would strip himself of all rather than any should go unsatisfied who as∣serted his Honour; After this he possest himself of several Towns, and marching toward Bran∣dusium whither Pompey and the Consuls were fled for more speedy transportation, he endea∣voured to prevent them but in vain, and so return'd to Rome with his Army, where cal∣ling the Senate together, and advising about the most weighty matters of State, he then marched into Spain against the most conside∣rable of Pompeys Forces, commanded then by three Lieutenants, saying at his going thither, That he was now going against an Army without a General, but at his return his next Expedition would be against a General (meaning Pompey) without an Army. He was opposed at Marseil∣les, but at length he reduced it, and setled Spain in a short time. Coming back to Rome, and ordering all things there according to his own mind, he marched against Pompey himself, and besiege him in his own Camp four Months
with incredible labour, & at last utterly defeated him at the Battle of Pharsalia; He persues him to Alexandria in Egypt where he finds him slain by King Ptolomy who was conspiring the same entertainment for him, whereupon he was there ingaged in a most desperate War, having nei∣ther time nor place to defend himself, yet though it was Winter, and his Supplies on that account uncertain, though he was shut up with∣in the same Walls with a numerous and subtle Enemy, and unprovided of all kind of necessa∣ties, he overcame them at last, made himself Master of all Egypt, and gave the command of it to Cleopatra, and her youngest Brother not daring to make it a Province, lest falling into the hands of a Pragmatical Governor, it might cause new disturbances. When Pompeys head was presented him he wept bitterly, and caused him to be honourably buried, saying, I lament Pompeys Fall, and fear my own Fortune; And finding many Letters in his Coffers where∣by divers shewed their good will to Pompey, and hatred toward him, he never read them, but instantly burnt them all, lest being exasperated by them he should have been tempted to com∣mit some great mischief; When Pompeys Images were thrown down, he set them up again, which made Cicero say, That Caesar in setting up Pom∣peys Images again made his own stand surer. He accounted his Conquest of the two Sons of Pompey the Great in Andaluzia in Spain the
most glorious of all his Victorys, for he would after often say, That at other times he fought for Fame and Glory, but that day for his life which he had never fought for before. From Alexandria he went into Syria, and from thence to Pontus, where in four hours he beat Mithridates quite out of the Field; after which he reduced Scipio, Juba and Pompeys Sons in Spain. In all his Civil Wars he never received any defeat in person, but only in his Lieutenants, Curio miscarrying in Africk, and Antonius taken Prisoner, Dolabella lost his Fleet in Illiricum, and Domitius his Army in Pontus; Once at Dyracchium when Pompey repulsed him, but not prosecuting his advantage, Caesar declared, He knew not hw to make the best use of a Victory; His next Exigence was in Spain abovementioned, where in his last Battle his af∣fairs were so desparate, that he thought once to kill himself. His wars being ended, he tri∣umpht five times, after he had defeated Scipio four times in a month, and once more after the victory over the Sons of Pompey; His first and most magnificent Triumph was that of the Gauls, his next of Alexandria, the third of Pontus, the fourth of Africk, and the last of Spain, the Pomp and preparation of each of them being different and various. On the day of his Gallick Triumph the Axletree of his Chariot breaking, he had like to have been cast upon the ground, He ascended to the
Capitol with lights, having forty Elephants at∣tending him on both hands, with carriers of Torches. In his Ponitck Triumph upon the several Pageants this Motto was inscribed, Veni, Vidi, Vici, I came, I saw, I overcame, alluding to the expedition of his Conquests. He be∣stowed very great gifts and possessions upon his Old Souldiers, and exhibited several Prizes, Stage-Plays, and other magnificent shews to please the People; And applying himself to the Settlement of the State, he reformed the Calen∣der which was then become confused, and re∣duced it to that Account which from him is to this day called the Julian Account. He filled up the Senate according to his own mind, none daring refuse to chuse whom he recom∣mended. In the administration of Justice he was diligent and severe, and reduced the Ex∣travagancy of Coaches, Diet and Cloths. His stature was tall, his complextion white, his limbs strong and compact, his visage full, his eyes black and lively, his temper sound and healthy, only in his latter days he was subject to Swounding fits, and to be affrighted in his Dreams; Twice he was surprized with the fal∣ling-sickness as he sate in judgment His bald∣ness was a great trouble to him, and had of∣ten exposed him to the scoffs of his Enemies, and therefore among all the Honours conferred upon him by the Senate and People, he receiv∣ed none with more delight than the priveledge
of wearing a Laurel Garden perpetually; In his Cloths he was singularly remarkable, wear∣ing his long Senators Robe studded with Gold, fringed at the hands and girt about, but al∣ways loosly, which gave occasion to that expres∣sion of Sylla, who oft admonisht the Nobility, To beware of that Boy who went girded so slight∣ly; He was exceedingly addicted to Neatness, and sumptuous Hospitality at his Table; It is re∣ported he undertook the Voyage into Great Brittain in expectation of Pearls, whose value he could judg by poising them in his hands; He was a great Lover, and a most curious Col∣lector of Jewels, Seals, Pictures, Statues, and all kind of Antiquities; He Spared no cost for Slaves if young and handsome. He kept his House in such exact Discipline, even in little things as well as great, that he clapt one of his Servants into Irons, for giving some Guests worse bred than himself, and punished another of his Gentlemen whom he much favoured, with death, for committing Adultery with the wife of a Roman Knight, though no complaint was brought against him. Yet the general report was that himself was much given to Women, (if not worse) and with his liberality debauched many Ladys of Quality, and among others Mutia the wife of Pompey, who was often upbraided, That out of an extravagant ambition of greatness he had Married Caesars Daughter for whose sake he had
put away his own wife though he had three Children by her, and they were wont in Passion to call him Adulterer; But his greatest affection was for Servitia the Mother of Brutus, present∣ing her with a Pearl of a very vast value, & suf∣fering her to purchase Lands at a very low rate; Nor did he abstain from the Ladys in the Pro∣vinces where he commanded, if we may believe what the Souldiers sung at his Gallick Triumph, Look to your Wives, our bald-pate Fornicator Will cuckold you; See therefore to the matter; His Money's spent in France, He's now come home At the Old Rate to borrow more at Rome. He was likewise inamoured of several Queens, as Eunoe wife of the King of Mauritania and o∣thers, but his chiefest Passion was for Cleopatra, with whom he would oft entertain himself till next morning, passing with her in the same Barge or Pleasure-boat into Egypt almost as far as Ethiopia, and had doubtless gone through had not his Army mutined and refused to follow him. He after invited her to Rome, and sent her back with many Honours and Rewards; He permitted her to call a Son of hers by his name, who its said did exactly resemble him. That he was temperate in drinking, his very Enemies confess. Cato's saying was; That he was the only sober man ever went about to subvert the Govern∣ment of the State. In his Diet he was so indif∣ferent, that being at a publick Entertainment
where ill Oyl was brought up instead of good, the rest refusing to touch it, he eat very hear∣tily, lest otherwise he should upbraid his Host of poverty or neglect. He abstained from no way of getting Money in his Civil and Milita∣ry Commands, and maintained his Civil Wars, Triumphs, and shews by all manner of Rapine and Sacriledge. In Eloquence and Martial Con∣duct he excelled the best of his Predecessors, none being more pungent nor frequent in his Senten∣ces, or more Neat and Elegant in his words. He writ the Commentaries of his own Actions in the Wars of France and against Pompey, in so Judicious, Eloquent and Modest a Stile, as justly makes it a question whether he writ or fought with the greater Spirit. At his Weapon, and riding the Great Horse he was excellently expert, and in labour most indefatigable, marching constantly at the head of his Army, both on Horseback and a foot, al∣ways with his head bare in all weathers. His di∣ligence was so incredible, that upon an expedi∣tion he would go fifty Leagues a day in a Hack∣ney Chariot, swimming over Rivers if any were in his way, or else passing over with blown Bladders, so as he out-ran all Intelligence of him. In his Martial undertakings, it is doubtful whe∣ther he used more Caution or Courage, he ne∣ver marched his Army in any dangerous ways, till he had first throughly discovered them; Be∣fore his landing in England, he himself survey∣ed
the Ports and Acesses to go into that Island. Having notice that his Camp was Besieged in Germany, he passed the Enemies Guards disgui∣sed like a Frenchman, and came safe to their re∣lief. No Religious scruple ever hindered his de∣signs; when he went against Juba, the Beast ran away just as it was to be Sacrificed, which was thought an ill Omen, yet he valued it not; As he was getting out of the Ship he fell to the ground, but perverting the bad presage he cri∣ed out, I take possession of thee O Africk. When he saw any Battle doubtful he dismounted his Troopers, and sent away all their Horses and his own first, that it being impossible to escape, they might either Fight or Dye. He rid upon a most remarkable Horse, whose Feet were al∣most like a Mans, the Hoofs being cloven to the Toes, he bred him up from a Colt with great care, because the Astrologers declared, That Hor∣ses Master should have the Empire of the World; Neither would the Horse suffer any Body upon him, but Caesar who back't him himself. He several times restored the Battle when it was almost lost, by opposing himself against them that fled, taking them by the Throats, and forcing their Faces toward the Enemy. After the Battle of Pharsalia, going to Sea in a Bark by himself, he met with ten of the Enemies Ships, and stoutly commanded them to yield, which they instantly performed. At the Siege of Alexandria, as he was attempting the Bridge,
the Enemy made a desperate Sally, and forced him into a Boat, into which others throwing themselves, he leapt into the Sea, and swam two hundred paces to the next Ship, though he held his left hand above water to preserve some Papers, and haled his Generals Robe after him with his Teeth lest it should fall into his Ad∣versaries hands; He considered his Souldiers nei∣ther by their Qualities nor Wealth, but their Courage and Strength, using them all alike, with the same severity and indulgence, and would oft give them false Alarms; If they were at any time discouraged with the report of the number of their Enemies, he would not lessen but in∣crease their number above what was true. As upon the approach of Juba whose power was terrible to them, he called them together, and said; Know that in few days Juba will be here with ten Legions, thirty Thousand men at Arms, an hundred Thousand Horse, and three hundred Elephants. Therefore let every one forbear to in∣quire or concern himself further, for I am suffici∣ently informed; and if any presume to discourage you, I will put him into the oldest Ship I can get, & expose him to the mercy of the Winds and Flouds. He neither took notice of all faults, nor pu∣nished them alike; Those that were seditious or deserted their Colours he punisht severe∣ly; After a Victory he would abate his strict Discipline, suffering all their Riot and Luxury, boasting often, That his Souldiers could fight in
their very perfumes. He used to call them his Companions and Fellow Souldiers, and kept them always brave in Arms shining with Gold and Silver that they might fight more stoutly if but to save their Armor, he loved them so well that hearing of the defeat of his party under Titurius, he let his Beard and Hair grow for in∣dignation till he was throughly revenged; By which obliging carriage his Souldiers had such an entire affection for him, that when he first undertook the Civil wars, there was not a Cap∣tain in his Legions but offered to find him a Horse out of their own pay, neither did any forsake him, and though taken by the Ene∣mies, and offered their lives to take up Arms a∣gainst him, chose rather to dye; They indured hunger and other extremities of War with ex∣traordinary constancy, and when repulsed at Dyracchium, they came and offered themselves to be punished, So that Caesar had more trou∣ble to comfort than correct them. During his ten years War in Gaul they never mutined, in his Civil Wars but seldom, and then returned presently to their duty; After he had made himself Emperor he advanced Persons of the meanest condition to the highest honours, for which being blamed, he said, If they were Thieves and Murtherers and had stuck to me in defence of my honour, I would have done the same. He was not naturally revengeful, and for Clemency and Moderation was admirable;
At the Battle of Pharsalia he proclaimed, That all Citizens should be spared; And none were kil∣led but in the heat of fight. And having infor∣mation of several conspiracies and meetings in the night, he troubled them no further than by Edict to let them know they were discovered. To such as spoke ill of him, he thought it suffi∣cient to admonish them before the People to desist for the future, and being severely asperst by Libels whose Authors were in his Power, he took all patiently without revenge. Yet many of his Speeches and his Irregular Actions suffici∣ently discover that he much abused his Authori∣ty, and committed many Capital Crimes; For besides the extravagant Honours he assumed, as the perpetual Dictatorship, the continual Con∣sulship, the Censorship, the Title of Emperor and Father of his Countrey, a Statue among the Kings, a Chair of Gold in the Senate, and ano∣ther in the Courts of Justice; He usurped grea∣ter Dignities than became a Man, as to have his Image carried like a God in the Cercensian Games; He had his Temples, Altars, and Ima∣ges placed by the Gods, his consecrated Beds and his Priests; In short there were no Honours whatever, but he took or gave as he pleased. Nor did his publick Expressions speak him less pre∣sumptuous, saying usually, The Common-wealth was now but a word without either Body or Soul. That Sylla was no good Grammarian to part with his Dictatorship so easily; That hereafter he
was to be spoke to with more reverence, and every word he ut∣tered was to be lookt on as a Law. Nay so confident was he grown that when a Beast in Sacrifice was found with∣out a Heart, which the Spectators said was an ill Omen; Trouble not your selves says he, theyshall be better when I please, nor is it to be thought a Prodigie if a Beast wants a Heart, But the most cruel, and desperate hatred against him rose from hence, that when the Senate came to him in a Body with most Honourable Decrees, he received them sitting before the Temple of Venus; And in one of his Triumpts passing by the Seats of the Tribunes, and ob∣serving all the Company rose up and saluted him but P. Aquilla the Tribune, he in great indignation cryed out; Well done Tribune Aquilla, you had best try if you can wrest the Government of the Common-wealth out of my hands with your Tribune-ship; When at a Festival one had put a Crown of Laurel on his Statue, and the Tribunes order∣ed it to be taken off, he was so offended, taking it for an ill Omen of his Coronation, that he sharply rebuked them and turned them out of their Commands. He suf∣fered some Persons to salute him with the Title of King; And it was affirmed that he resolved suddenly to declare his Opinion that Caesar should be called King, because he found in the Books of the Sybyls, that the Parthians were not to be Conquered but by a King. This was the great occasion of hastening the Conspi∣racy against him, and their Councels were now united, the People growing sensible of their condition, and wish∣ing for some Body to assert their Liberties; some writ under the Statue of the former Brutus, Would to God thou were alive again; Others under Caesars Image, Brut us was created the first Conful for expelling Kings, and this man the last of Kings for suppressing Consuls; The Conspiracy was managed by above threescore Persons, the chief were C. Cassius, Marcus and Decimus Brutus, they long delibe∣rated whether to throw him over the Bridge, or to kill him at his entrance into the Theater, but when the Se∣nate had Order to meet in Pompeys Court upon the Ides of March, they preferred that time and place before all the rest.
Caesar had warning of his death by many Presages; In digging up some Sepulcher, at Capua, they found in the Monument of Capys Founder of that City, a Brass Ta∣ble with this Inscription in Greek, When the Bones of Ca∣pys shall be discovered, it shall come to pass that a Person de∣scended from Julus shall be murdered by his Kindred, and his death revenged a while after with the ruin of all Italy; Not many days before this disaster, his Horses which he had consecrated at his passage over the Rubicon, being turn∣ed into the Fields, refused to eat, and seem'd to weep abundantly. As he was at Sacrifice, Spurinna the South∣sayer bid him beware of the danger hanging over his head which would scarce be deferred beyond the Ides of March; The day before, a little Bird called Regaliolus flying into Pompeys Court with a branch of Laurel in her mouth, was pursued by several Birds out of the next Grove and torn in pieces there. That night he himself dreamt he was flying above the Clouds, and sometimes shaking Jupiter by the hand. Calphurnia his Wife dreamt likewise that the top of the House was fallen down, and that her Husband was stabbed in her Arms, and imme∣diately the doors flew open of themselves; Upon which she earnestly perswaded him not to go to the Senate that day, but all the Charms of her loving Eloquence and Tenderness could not prevail; Hear his answer in the words of the Elegant Cucan, as excellently rendred into English. Ah Dear Calphurnia! Dearer to me than that life breath I draw Would'st thou forbear thy grief, it could not lye Within the power of any Prodigie. To make this day a sad one; should I here Begin to learn that superstitious fear Of Fatal days and hours, what day to me Could e're hereafter from such fears be free, I only should my wretched mind torment And not my destin'd time of Death prevent, But live forever with vain fear diseas'd When e're Astrologers and Augurs pleas'd,
If Caesars danger grow from discontent Of Rome, not one days absence can prevent Nor scarce reprieve my Fate, and once to dye Better than ever fear Conspiracy. What good can strongest Guards on me confer, But make me live perpetual Prisoner? Why should I fear the Peoples discontent? Who now enjoy under my Government More wealth, more safety, and prosperity. Than by my death they could? The death of me That have already reach't the height of all Glory and State that can to man befal. And wrought my furthest ends, can never be So much my own as their calamity. Oh do not fear thy Dream, Calphurnia, Nor sad Presages from such trifles draw, But if they are Presages, tell me then, (For our two Dreams to night have different been) Which should prevail? Methought I flew above The lofty Clouds and toucht the hand of Jove. And to my self did seem more great and high Than e're before; what but felicity Should this portend? I dare not now suspect In Peace, Heavens care who helpt me to effect My roughest Wars; Oh let no sad surmise With causeless grief bedew Calphurnias Eyes. Yet though he seemed to slight these Prodigies, they had such influence upon him, that he had once some thoughts of staying at home that day. But D. Brutus coming, and perswading him not to disappoint the Se∣nate now it was full, and had long attended him, he went about Eleven a Clock; By the way he was pre∣sented by a Person he met, with a Paper discovering the whole Conspiracy, but he put it among his Papers in his left hand as if he would read it anon. Having then Sacrificed to the Gods, and succeeding in none, in defiance of all these ill Omens, he entred the Senate, laughing at Spurinna for a false Prophet, seeing the Ides
Ides of March were come without any disaster, to which he replied, They are come indeed but not past. As soon as he was set, the Conspirators placed themselves about him pretending to do him honour, and immediately Cimber Tullius who had ingaged to begin, addrest him∣self to him as if to demand something, but Casar seeming to put him off to another time, Cimber catcht hold of his Gown by both Shoulders, and Caesar cry∣ing ont that, This was violence, one of the Cassii came and stab'd him under the Throat, Caesar laying hold of his Arm struck it through with his Dagger, and endeavouring to rise was stopt by another wound, when Brutus assaulted him he cryed out, And art thou amongst them too my Son Brutus? but seeing several Swords presented to his Breast, he covered his head with his Gown, and in this manner received twenty three wounds, and died without speaking a word, or fetch∣ing so much as a sigh. Which the Poet thus expresses. Hopeless he hides his Face and fixed stands T'indure the fury of revenging hands. Suppressing groans, or words, as loth to shame His former life, or dying, stain the Fame Of those great deeds throughout the World exprest These silent thoughts revolving in his Breast. "Yet has not Fortune changed, nor given the power "Of Coesars head to any Conqueror. "By no Superiors proud command I dye, "But by subjected Romes Conspiracy. "Who to the World confesses by her fears, "My Power and Strength to be too great for hers, "And from Earths highest Throne sends me to be "By after Ages made a Deity. Being dead all the Conspirators fled, and he was carried home in a Litter; They once resolved to have drawn his Body into Tyber, to have confiscated his Estate, and make void all his Acts, but were afraid of M. Antonius the Consul. He was afterward buried with
very great Magnificence and Pomp, and instead of a Funeral Oration M. Antonius the Consul published an Act of the Senate, by which they decreed him all Ho∣nour both Humane and Divine, and likewise caused an Oath to be read, whereby they obliged themselves in the defence of a single Person. The Funerals being over, the people ran in multitudes with Firebrands in their hands to set the Houses of Brutus and Cassius on Fire. Some thought that his sickness made him de∣sire to live no longer, all agree he died according to his own desire, for reading how Cyrus being under the extremity of a Disease, gave directions for his Fu∣neral, abhorring so tedious a death, he wisht when he died it might be of a sudden, and the day before his death being at Supper with Lepidus, a question arising which was the best death, he declared, In his Judgment a sudden and unexpected. He died in the 56 year of his Age, and was Cannoniz'd among the Gods, not only by those who made the Decree, but by the per∣swasion of the People. Of his Murtherers scarce any out-lived him three years, or died a natural death. All stood Condemned, and fell by divers Accidents, some drowned at Sea, others killed in Fight, and some flew themselves with the same Dagger wherewith they had Murdered Caesar. He lived in the year of the World 3901. and before the Birth of Christ 47 years.
The Hist. of Joshua Capt. General and Leader of Israel into Canaan. The Fourth Worthy of the World. portrait of Joshua Joshua's much Woth, than the Three before They False Gods, he the True God did adore, By whose Great Pow'r and over-ruling hand The Sun and Moon he caused still to stand, And made a longer day than e're was known Whereby Gods Enemies might be overthrown. He thirty Kings subdu'd in Canaan, And setled Israel in their Conquer'd Land, At length be full of Years and Victories He leaves to Israel this last advice, That they should serve the Lord and him obey, And then God from the Earth takes him away.
WHO can see the Sun and not remember Joshua, and the great Commerce that this valorous Captain had with the King of Stars; All the world lift up their Eyes to it, but none but he hath lifted up his voice so far as it, to make himself be heard, and obeyed. The Stars knew Joshua (or Jesus) because he bore the name of him that formed them; It is he that gave us the foretasts of the name of Jesus, at which the Heaven, the Earth, and Hell do bend the knee. Moses knowing that by Gods appointment he was to die, and not enter into the Land of Canaan; When they came upon the Borders, he called the Israelites together, and spake to them to this purpose; Seeing, saith he, I go to my Ancestors, and God hath prefixed this day for my depar∣ture, it is very just that while I am alive and stand in your pre∣sence, I should give him thanks for the care and providence he hath hitherto had of your Affairs, not only in delivering you from so many evils, but also in largely imparting his blessings to you, and because he hath also assisted me with his savour whilst with my utmost I endenvoured to make you as happy as possible) for it is he only who hath begun and accomplisht all those great things that have been done for you, and who hath made me his Minister and Servant in all the good which you have received; For all which blessings, I have thought it requisite in departing from you to praise the goodness of that God, who in time to come shall have the care and charge over you, and to acquit my self of that debt, I leave you this remembrance, That you ought to serve and honour the Lord, and reverence the Ordinances which he hath given you, whereby he may continue his favour toward you, and may give you grace to preserve and keep his Excellent Commands; Surely a Law-giver that were no more than a man, would be much dis∣pleased with those who should violate his Ordinances, and set them at nought; Do not you therefore tempt God, who is provoked to anger when those Laws which he himself hath established and given you shall be contemned and neglected. Whilst Moses pronounced these his last words, and foretold to the Tribes their several Destinies, and wished them all manner of blessings, the whole multitude brake out into Tears, and the Women beating their breasts,
shewed their sorrow for his Death; The Children like∣wise lamented because in their tender years they had understood the virtue and samous Acts of Moses; Who beholding their affection could not restrain himself from Tears; Afterward he walked toward the place where he was to die, and they all followed him weeping, when beckoning to them to stand still, and not afflict him any longer with their griefs, having appointed Joshua to be his Successor to head the Armies against the Canaanites, according to the Command of God, and laid his hands on him he went accompanied only with him and Eleazer the High Priest, up to the Mount Abarim, which is very high, and from whence he could discover the greatest part of the Land of Canaan, where taking his last leave of Joshua and Eleazer, with many endearing imbraces, on a sudden a Cloud incompassed him, and he was carried in∣to a certain Valley where he died and was buried. The whole time of his Life was a hundred and twenty years, the third part whereof he spent in governing this great People; In Counsel and Judgment he had no equal; In Eloquence he was incomparable; His skill in War made him renowned amongst the greatest Captains, and no man had the gift of Prophecy in so great a degree, for his words seemed as so many Oracles, and as if inspired by God himself. The People mourned for him thirty days with real grief and trouble; In short, he left behind him a great estimation among all who were acquainted with his Virtues and Graces. After Moses was taken from among men, and the time of mourning past, Joshua a man in whom was the Spirit of wisdom, commanded the People to prepare and march forward to battel; Sending spies to Jericho to sound their minds, and discover their Forces, and then raising his Camp, he proceeded toward the River Jordan; And the Princes of the Tribes of Reuben and Gad and of the half Tribe of Manasses (to whom the Countrey of the Amo∣rites, which was the Seventh part of Canaan, was given for an habitation) having furnished him with Fifty hou∣sand men, he proceeded toward the Enemy; At which
time the Spies returning, and having surveyed Jericho gave an Account thereof, and likewise how narrowly they es∣caped, having been hid by Rahab the Harlot under some packs of Linnen, who being thus delivered from danger by her means, she desired them to swear, That when they should take Jericho and kill all the Inhabitants with the Sword, as she knew that God had commanded, they would save her life and the lives of her family as she had saved theirs; Which they accordingly agreed to, advising her that when she should perceive the City ready to be taken, she should bring all that she would have spared into her own house and then hang a red Cloth over her door, that the General observing the sign might forbid the Soldiers from plun∣dring or destroying her or hers; After this she let them down with a rope from the Wall, whereby they escaped back again. Joshua having this account, seemed somewhat concern∣ed how they should pass over the River Jordan, because it was deep and without Bridges. But God promised him they should have a safe passage over; Joshua therefore waited with his Army two days, and then passed over the River, the Priests going first with the Ark, who as soon as they had set their feet in the Water, which was then very high, it being in harvest, the Waters from above rose up in an heap, and the Priests stood on dry ground in the midst of Jordan till all the People passed quite over, and then according to Gods command, they took out of the middle of the River Twelve Stones wherewith to build an Altar for a Memorial to after-ages of this wonderful deliverance; And all things being finisht, the Priests came out of the River, which instantly after flowed with as much violence as before; Whilst the Israelites did all this, the Canaanites never sallied out upon them, but dismayed with fear, kept themselves within the Walls of Jericho, which Joshua resolved to besiege with all his Forces; But God commanded him that on the first day of the feast, the Priests leaving the Ark and guarded on every side with Troops of armed men should draw near Jericho, sound-Seven Rams horns, and at night to return to their Camp;
This they performed six days together, but on the Se∣venth, Joshua assembled the People early, and caused them to incompass the City seven times that day, and the Trum∣pets sounding with great force, the Walls by the power of God without any violence used by the Hebrews, fell down flat to the ground, so that entring the City over the ruines they put all within it to the Sword, the Enemy through the sudden astonishment that fell upon them being unable to resist, and so great was the slaughter that they neither spared Women nor Children, but filled the City with dead Carcases, which at length being set on fire served for a fu∣neral flame to consume them; Only Rahab and her houshold were saved by the Spies, and Joshua bestowed an Inheritance upon her; and ever after held her in great honour. Then Joshua denounced Curses on those who should endeavour to rebuild this City, foretelling. That he should lay the foundation thereof in the days of his Eldest Son, and should lose his youngest ere it was finished. There was much Spoil taken both of Gold, Silver, and Brass in this City, and Joshua having before commanded that all the Gold and Silver should be brought to one place to offer to God as the first fruits for his assistance, none of them, but only one man, kept any thing to himself, all being de∣livered to the Priests to be laid up in the Treasury, but Achan the Son of Zebedias of the Tribe of Judah having got the Kings Coat imbroidered with Gold, and a Wedge of Gold of two hundred Shekels in weight, and thinking it unjust that what he had got with the hazard of his Life should be taken from him, he digged a Pit in his Tent and buried his Spoils therein, designing to defraud God as well as his Companions. At this time the Israelites Tens were pitched in Gilgal, which signifies Liberty, because being delivered from Egyptian bondage, and the wants of the wilderness they now thought they had nothing more to fear; A few days after the distruction of Jericho Joshua sent out three thousand armed men against Ai, a City hard by, who encountring with their adversarys, the Israelites were put
to flight and lost thirty six men; The news of this disaster being brought to the Camp, they were much astonished, not only for the men they had lost, but dispairing of future success, since they perswaded themselves they were already Masters of the Feild, and that their Army should be always Victorious according to the promise of God, and that this advantage would much incourage their Enemies; So that cloathing themselves in Sack∣cloth, they spent three days in tears and lamentations without taking any meat; When Joshua saw them thus dejected, falling on his face to the Earth he thus addres∣sed himself to God. O Lord thou knowest we have not been induced by our own rashness and temerity to attempt the Conquest of this Land by force, but have been thereunto incouraged by thy Servant Moses to whom thou didst promise by divers signs to give us this Country to inhabit, and that our Armys should always have the Victory in Battle, and of these thy promise we have oftimes experienced the certain accomplishment; But now O Lord what shall I say when Israel turneth their backs before their Enemies, for having beyond all expectation received an over∣throw, and lost some of our Souldiers, we are extreamly terri∣fied by this accident, lest the Canaanites and all the inhabi∣tants of the Land should hear it, and should incompass us and cut off our name from the Earth, for we have little hope of any prosperous proceedings, in time to come; But be thou assistant to us O Lord who art Almighty, and in thy mercy change our present sorrow into joy, our discouragement into confidence, and give us Victory. Joshua having made this Prayer, God presently com∣manded him to arise and purge the People from that Sa∣criledge and Theft which had been committed among them, by concealing those things which were consecra∣ed to himsef, assuring him that his was the cause of their present Calamity, which as soon as it was discovered, Is∣rael should be again victorious over their Adversaries. Joshua hereupon calling for the High Priest and the Ma∣gistrates, he cast Lots upon the Tribes, and the Lot fell upon the Tribe of Judah, he then cast them again upon Families, and it fell upon the Family of Zacharias; Lastly,
the Lots were cast Man by Man, and it fell upon Achan, who unable to deny what was discovered by God him∣self, confessed the fact, and produced what he had con∣cealed, whereupon he was presently stoned to death, and the Anger of the Lord was appeased. Then Joshua having purified the People, led them forth against the City of Ai, and laying an ambush of men se∣cretly over night above the City, early in the morning he drew the Enemy out to fight, who being encouraged by their former success, boldly assaulted them, but Joshua seeming to retreat and flie, drew them farther off the City, imagining that the Israelites fled, and that they should gain a second Victory over them, and thereupon all the Men of Ai, and of the next City Bethel, were called out to pursue them, so that there was not a man left in either City. When Joshua suddenly making a stand, and giving a signal to those in ambush, they instantly march∣ed into the City and set it on fire, which when the Men of Ai looking back perceived, they presently fled and scattered themselves through the Fields, but were pur∣sued so furiously that few escaped, the King of Ai was taken alive and hanged on a Tree by Joshua, and twelve thousand, even all the Inhabitants of Ai were slain that day; The spoil they got was very considerable both in Silver and Cattel, all which Joshua when he came to Gil∣gal distributed among the Souldiers. The Gibionites who dwelt near Jerusalem, having notice what had happened to Jericho, and Ai, and fearing the same misfortune, since they understood that Joshua in∣tended utterly to root out the Canaanites from off the Earth, they resolved to send Ambassadors to conclude a Peace with him, and knowing that if they owned them∣selves to be Canaanites, Joshua would make no League with them; They came to him with protestations, that they had no converse nor alliance with that Nation, but being incited by the fame of his glorious Victories, they were come from a very far Countrey, which he might perceive by their old Shoes and Garments, and by the mouldy Bread, which were all new when they set forth
on their Journey, but by the length of the way were now in the condition they saw them; And that they were assured that God had given the Israelites the Land of Canaan to inherit, with whom they therefore desired to be confederate; By this subtil practice they perswaded the Hebrews to enter into Amity with them, and Eleazer the High Priest and the Council of Elders sware to them that they should for the future be their Friends and Al∣lies, and no hostility should be offered them. In three days after Joshua incamping on the Borders of their Countrey, understood that the Gibeonites dwelt not far from Jerusalem, and were Canaanites, and sending for the Chief of them, charged them with this deceitful dealing, who alledged that having no other way to procure their safety they were obliged to make use of this, whereupon he called to him the High-Priest and Elders; and they concluded not to infringe the Outh of God, but however for this treachery they were condemned to be Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water to the Camp. When the King of Jerusalem heard that the Gibeonites had sub∣mitted to Joshua, he assembled live Kings his Neighbours, and re∣solved to fall upon them, who perceiving their danger, desired Joshua to assist them, who marching with all speed to their relief, he with his whole Army fell upon them early in the morning, and quickly put them to flight, and pursuing them to a steep Tract called Bth∣horon the Lord destroyed a great number of them by Thunder, Lightning, and Hailstones from Heaven, and the night approaching Joshua with mighty Faith cryed out, Sun stand thou still upon Gibe∣on, and thou Moon in the Valley of Ajalon, and the Sun stood still, and the Moon was stayed till the Peope had avenged themselves on their Enemies, and the Sun did not go down about a whole day, and there was no day like that before or after it, that the Lord hearkned to the voice of a man, for the Lord fought fr Israel; and the five Kings hid themselves in a Cave near Makkedah, but were discovered and brought to Joshua, who commanded his Captains to tread upon their Necks as an evident token to them of success against all the rest; After which he slew thom and hanged them on five Trees, and their Forces were utterly cut off and destryed; After this wonderful success; Joshua led his Army to the Mountains of Canaan, where having made a great slaughter, and taken rich booty he brought back the People to Gilgal. The Renown of the Israelites Victories, and that they gave no quarter coming among the Neighbour Nations, they were possest with extream far, and resolved to try their utmost strength; Where∣upon their Kings raised an Army of three hundred thousand Foot, en thousand Horse, and twenty thousand Chariots, so great an Host
as was sufficient utterly to swallow up the Israelites; But the Lord bid Joshua not to fear, since they should all surely be delivered into his hand; Incouraged by these promises, Joshua marcht out coura∣giously against his Enemies, and the fifth day he came upon them; The Encounter was strong, and the Slaughter very great, multitudes being also kill'd in the pursuit, and all the Kings slain, very few of this numerous Army making their escape; Joshua having command-their Horses to be slain, and their Chariots to be burnt; he afterward marched victoriously through the whole Countrey, besieging and ta∣king many strong places, and killing all that fell into his hands, so that in five years none of the Canaanites were left alive, but only in two or three strong Fortresses. Then Joshua removed his Camp to Shiloh, and set up the Taber∣nacle there, and from thence he marched to Sichem, and there built an Altar according to the command of Moses, and being now well stricken in years, he assembled all the People in Shiloh, where he represented to them the happy success wherewith till that time God had favoured them because they had observed his Laws, that no less than one and thirty Kings who had presumed to oppose them, were by them overcome, and all their Armies discomfited in Battel, and most of their Cities destroyed, so that there was no memory of them remaining, he therefore thought fit they should send to survey the extent of Canaan, and to measure it out among the Tribes; which being approved of by the Congregation, ten men were appointed to view the Land, who returning with a full account of it in fix months time, Joshua with the High-Priests and Princes of the Tribes divid∣ed the Countrey amongst them; and then he distributed the prey they had taken from the Enemy, which was very great, so that they were all inriched by it. After which he assembled the whole Army, and to those that were planted on the other side Jordan, who had born Arms with the rest, and were in number no less than Fifty Thousand, he spake af∣ter this manner; Since God the Father and Master of our Nation hath given this Countrey into your possession, and hath promised to preserve the same to your for ever, and since ye have cheerfully assisted us in all our necessities and dangers, according to Gods command and direction, it is requisite, now we have no further service for you, that we dismiss you home to enjoy what you purchased, and may thereby be in a capa∣city to ingage with us hereafter upon all occasions. We therefore give you hearty thanks that you have vouchsafed to be our companions in all our perils, and desire you would always continue this mutual af∣fection between us, remembring that by Gods favour, and our assist∣ing each other we have attained to this our present Felicity. Neither have you adventured without some reward for your labours, for you are hereby inriched, and shall carry home much Cattle, with Silver, Gold, Brass, Iron, and very much Raiment, and likewise our sineere love to you, whenever you have occasion to use us; For we have no
forgot nor slighted Moses command before his death, neither have you spared any pains to oblige us to you. We therefore dismiss you to your own possessions in fulness of Contentment, beseeching you never to put any bounds to our inviolable Amity, and Friendship, and let not the Ri∣ver Jordan which is betwixt us hinder you from considering us as Hebrews, for we are all the posterity of Abraham, and the same God gave Life to both our progenitors, whose Laws and Religion instituted by Moses are diligently to be observed, for thereby will the Lord be∣come our helper, but if we degenerate from his Statutes he will sure∣ly be our Enemy. Having spoke thus, Joshua imbraced the Chief of the Tribes, who returned and their whole peoplewith them; After the Tribe of Reuben and Gad and the rest of the Menassites had passed over Jor∣dan, they built an Altar upon the Bank of the River as a Memorial to Posterity of their Alliance with those on the other side; which when the Israelites beyond Jordan heard, they rashly imagined their Brethren designed to violate their Religion, and introduce the Worship of false Gods, and therefore instantly Armed themselves to be revenged on them as having forsaken the Laws and Ordinances of their Fore-Fathers. But Joshua and Eleazer the High-Priest, and the Elders restrained them, advising first to inquire what their in∣tention was, and accordingly to proceed against them; Whereupon they sent Phinehas the Son of Eleazer, and ten of the Princes as Ambassadors to them, who when they were arrived, an Assembly was summoned, and Phinehas standing up in the midst of them, spake to this purpose. You have committed too heinous an offence to be punished with words, and yet we would not suddenly take up Arms against you, though the crime you have committed is very heinous, but rather chuse first to admonish you; To which purpose we are sent to you as Ambassaders, hoping that in confideration of the Friendship between us you will be per∣swaded to acknowledge and detest your fault; We therefore require you to inform us of the cause why you have built an Altar, that if it be with an ill design you may not think you are hardly dealt with, if we take revenge upon you for the same, but if it be otherwise, we may be satisfied upon what account it is erected; For we can scarce believe that you who are so well grounded in the knowledg of God, and the Laws which he himself hath given you, should since your departure from us, and arrival in your own Patrimony, which you have obtained by his favour, and peaceably enjoy by his Providence. So forget him, as to forsake his Tabernacle, Ark, and Altar, and introducestrange Gods, and thereby be Partakers of the impieties of the Canaanites; Yet if you repent your folly and return to your Ancient Religion a pardon is granted you, but if you obstinately persist in your wickedness, we will venture all in defence of our Faith, and Gods true Religion, and will treat you like the Inhabitants of Canaan; For though you have past the River you are not exempt from Gods power who is in all places, and
can at all times avenge himself upon you for your Iniquities. Resolve therefore with your selves to renounce your Error, and consider whether it be not better for you to enjoy Peace and Safety, than to expose your selves, your Wives and Children to the danger of a bloudy War. Phinchas ending hi Oration, the Chief of the Assembly made this reply; We never the ight of breaking the Ʋnion which joins us so near together, or of innevating any thing in the Religion of our Fathers; we will always persevere therein; We know that there is one God the common Father of all the Hebrews; and none but the Brazen Altar which is before the Tabernacle shall receive our Sacrifices; As for that which we have  erected, and causeth suchjealousie in you, we did not build it with the least intent to Offer Sacrifice thereon, but only as a perpetual  of our Alliance, and f our Obligation to con∣inue firm in the same belief, but without the least intent of making alteration in our Religion; To the truth whereof we call Almighty God to witness, therefore instead of continuing in all ill opinion of us, we desire that for the future you would never suspect us conscious of such a crime whereof none of Abrahams Posterity can he guilty with∣out deserving to lose his life. Having heard this modest reply, and praised their Constancy, Phinehas returned, and gave Joshua an Ac∣count thereof in the presence of the People, who rejoicing that there, was no cause of Bloudshed, Offered Sacrifices of Thansgiving to God and dissolving the Assembly each man returned nome. A r twenty years, Joshiea being extream old, called to him the Princes, Magistrates and Elders, to whom he uttered his dying words to this Effect; That they should call to remembrance the many benefits God had bestowed upon them, whereby from a very mean and afflicted condition they had attained to great Riches and Glory; He then ear∣nestly exhorted them Religiously to observe Gods Commandments, that so he might continue his merciful hand over them, since he assured them that they could obtain his favour by no other way but Obedience; Which he thought himself obliged to admonish them of before his departure out of this Life. That he was certain was now just at hand; As he ended these words he gave up the Ghost, and died in the hundred and tenth year of his Age, whereof he spent forty as Minister under Moses their Chief Magistrate, and after his death he Governed the Common-wealth twenty five years; A man of incomparable Prudence and Eloquence, Wise and Diligent in mat∣ters of Government, and equally capable of the most important Af∣fairs in Peace and War, in a word, the Most Excellent Captain Ge∣neral of his time, whose only presence was worth hundreds or others, whose Souldiers thought nothing impossible under him, and by whom his Enemies esteemed themselves vanquished as soon as seen; But let us remember while we speak of Joshua that God hath covered him with the Rays of Glory, so that we are constrained to cover his brave Acts in silence. He died in the year from the Creation of the World 2560, and about 1500 years before the Birth of Jesus Christ.
The History of David King of Israel; The Fifth Worthy of the World. portrait of King David DAvid a Man was, after Gods own heart, Who wondrous blessings did to him impart; By whose assistance in his youth he kill'd The Great Goliah, and so won the Field; But though he made this mighty Monster fall, A greater rose; The jealousy of Saul, Yet Saul at length in battle overthrown David obtains the Kingdom and the Crown, A Worthies name he justly doth deserve Whom many Worthies did obey and serve. He reigned forty, lived seventy years, And then Death put an end to all his Cars.
THE Life of David is a mixture of Good and Evil, of Joy and Grief, of Contempts and Glories, of Vices and Virtues, of Actions and Passions, of unthought of Successes, and of strange Accidents and Marvels; We will consider him in a twofold state, of a Servant, and of a Master, and will observe with what Wisdom he pre∣served himself in the one, and with what Majesty he be∣haved himself in the other. He comes first to Court un∣der the quality of a Musician, there he makes himself known for a good Souldier, admired as a Commander of an Army, and crowned as a Conqueror. Saul was tormented with an Evil Spirit which was maintained by his melancholy humor, and nourished by his passion, They seek out for him a fair Young man, who withal was skilful in playing on the Harp, to make him merry, one of his Servants said, That David the Son of Jesse was fit for that Imployment; He is sent for in the Kings name, he comes, he pleaseth while he played on his In∣struments, but Saul is displeased when he handleth his Weapons, whose envy caused his Valour to be reputed a fault. This young Shepherd who in his Apprenticeship had learned to fight with Lions and Bears, would go to the War as well as his Brethren, who blame his Curiosity, and despise his Person; There must be usually some fa∣mous Exploit to put a man at first in great credit at Court, and the Combate of Goliah was that which Hea∣ven had prepared to raise David; One man alone who affrighted the whole Army, nine foot high, and armed with five hundred pound weight of Iron, continues for forty days his proud Bravado's, challenging the stoutest of the Israelites to combate. All their hearts were frozen at the sound of his terrible voice, and none dares come forth against him. The King propounds great Riches and his Daughter in marriage to him who would take away this blemish from the People of God, printed on the whole face of the Army by this Philistine. David hereupon presents himself, and gets forth to fight with him, not with the guilded Arms of Saul, but only with
a Sling; The Giant scoffs at him, and finding him suffi∣ciently armed to defend himself from Dogs, but not fit to set upon Men, he designs Davids little body as a fit prey for some Bird of rapine. But this Champion of the Lord of Hosts reads first a Lesson to him of Religion be∣fore he shews his skill in fighting; Thou comest to me (saith he) with a Spear, a Sword, and a Buckler, but I come to thee in the Name of the God of Armies, of the God of the Hosts of Israel, at which thou this day hast scoffed with so great inso∣lence; It is written in Heaven that this great God will deliver thee into mine hands, and that I shall take away thine head from off thy shoulders, and that I shall make a great Feast for all the Beasts of prey with the flesh of this thy monstrous Body, whereby thou shalt know there is a God in Israel. He saith it, he doth it, he strikes his Adversary with a blow of the Sling in the midst of his Forehead, & makes this mighty Tower of flesh to fall in a moment, cutting off the head of this terrible Giant with his own Sword, which put the whole Army of the Philistims to confusion, and raised up the glory of the chosen People to an in∣comparable height. Yet this is the fountain of all the great Evils that David after suffered, the Great ones ad∣mire him, the People applaud him, he is the Subject of the Songs of the Daughters of Jerusalem, which set him above Saul. It is this Musick that enraged Sauls evil Spi∣rit, and would not give him any rest; David must be destroyed because he saved the Nation; He must be put to death because he restored the people to life; He must be dishonoured for having recovered the honour of the King; He is sufficiently faulty because he is too virtuous. Saul resolved to be rid of David, yet thought it dange∣rous to attempt his life openly who was so high in the peoples esteem, and therefore under pretence of ho∣nour bestows on him a chief place in the Army, belie∣ving his Courage would carry him into danger, and so his death would be imputed to chance or destiny; But when he saw he returned from manifest perils with Vi∣ctory and the applause of Israel, and that he behaved himself with great wisdom, Saul suspected him more than
before, and injuriously married his Eldest Daughter to another; But since his honour was ingag'd, and to pre∣vent the scandal of faithlesness, he offers him his youn∣ger Daughter Michael, but with very harsh and dangerous conditions, no less than by the death of two hundred Philistims, whom he hoped it was hardly possible for him to vanquish, but herein God who overthrows the de∣signs of the malicious to establish his own Councils upon their ruines, caused the Victories and Marriage of David to succeed to his own content, accompanied with the good will and admiration of all the Court. Jonathan the Eldest Son of Saul was so astonished with his valiant Exploits, his rare Virtues, and incomparable Carriage, that he loved him as his own Heart, and be∣reft himself of the most precious things he had to adorn him withal; David likewise swears unto him reciprocally an Immortal Friendship, and their two Souls seem'd united together with an indissoluble affection. Poor Jona∣than who was of incomparable mildness declared to his Father as much as he durst the innocency of David, and the great services he had done to the Crown, assuring him there was not a man in the Kingdom of a more harmless and pleasing Conversation, and that it was the joy of his Heart, and his only safety to have him always at his side; Saul seem'd to be overcome with these dis∣courses, and suffered David, whom he had driven far off, to return again near his Person, but Saul upon a day when David play'd on the Harp in his presence, endeavoured to strike him through with his Lance had not Davids nimbleness avoided that evil blow, and lest any should charge him with perfidiousness, he excused it by the dis∣temper of his Spirit; Jonathan yet another time endea∣voured his reconciliation, but being repelled by Saul with harsh words and threats to kill him, he saw clearly there was no more safety for his Friend, and perswaded him to retire; David goes from Court, and makes a sad departure from his beloved Jonathan, thousands of tears and sighs being vented betwixt them. Saul seeing he was escaped out of his bloudy hands,
sends Souldiers to bring him back, which Michal his Wife having notice of, she tells her Husband, and makes him depart suddenly in the deep silence of the night, putting in his place an Image in the Bed; Next morning Sauls Guards break into the House, and passing on to the Bed, there found the counterfeit; Michal was accused thereof and chidden by Saul, but she excused her self saying, Her Husband had compelled her to it, threatning to kill her, if she would not obey; This still increased his rage, and caused him to invent every day new means to destroy him, whom above all men he ought to have preserved. In the mean time David knew not whither to retire himself; He would have taken the boldness to have gone to Samuel who was yet alive, but this would have been prejudicial to both in the mind of Saul, who turned all suspitions into fury; He therefore goes to the Town of Nob to Abimelech the High-Priest, who seeing him in a very mean Equipage was somewhat amazed at his Arri∣val. But David to confirm him, said that he came about some urgent business of the Kings, and had not time to provide for his Journey, desiring the Priest to give him some Bread and a Sword, who having no other, gave him some Loaves of the Consecrated Shew-Bread, and the Sword of Goliah which was kept in the Tabernacle for a Monument. Saul hearing that David was seen in the Woods with a Lance in his hand, and accompanied with several Cap∣tains and Officers, sharply complained of the unfaithful∣ness of his Servants. Whereupon Doeg an Edomite of a barbarous behaviour, to get savour with his Master, ac∣cused Abimelech the Priest with all his Company for fur∣nishing David with Weapons and Provisions, he being present at that time; Saul instantly sent for him, and re∣proached him with the fact, he wisely excused it as not knowing but David was as much in the Kings favour as ever, and that what he did was for Sauls service as he judged This excuse was very just and lawful, but the jealousie of Saul was never satisfied, so that without any other form of proceeding, he commanded that villanous
Butcher Doeg, (all others refusing to lift up their hands against these sacred Persons) to fall upon the High-Priest, and the Priests that accompanied him, eighty five in number, who were all murdered in one day, and that cursed Servant exceeding his Commission drove on his Murderers to the Town of Nob which they filled with Fire and Bloud. David having understood by Abiathar the Son of the High-Priest all that was past, was pierced with most bit∣ter grief, accusing himself as the cause of the death of these unhappy ones, and perceiving well the Spirit of Saul was wholly invenomed, he saved himself in the Cave of Adullam, where though he thought himself hid from the Eyes of all the World, yet his Father and Brethren flying the Persecution, found him out, and wounded his tender heart with their Lamentations for the change of his condition, who was now no longer a David Triumphant, the object of all thoughts, and the discourse of all Tongues; He comforted them the best he could, and recommended them to the protection of the King of Moab till he knew what it would please God to do with him; At this time all the banished that fled for safety, and all the miserable betook themselves to David to the number of four hundred men, who intrenched themselves in a Fortress, going forth every day to seek wherewithal to maintain themselves. In the midst of all these misfortunes the good Prince kept always in his Heart a true love of his Countrey, and knowing that the Philistines had laid Siege before Keilh he fail'd not to re∣lieve it, though this ungrateful City designed to have deli∣vered him up to Saul if he had inclosed himself therein, which having consulted the Oracle of God he would not do, but retired to the Desart of Ziph, where Jonathan his beloved Friend secretly met him, comforted him, and assured him that he should be King after his Father, and that himself would be content to be his second. Mean while David ran from Desart to Desart with his Troops, when he received a severe Check from Nabal to whom he sent for relief, and for which he threatened to
destroy his Family, had not Abigal, who appeared before him with great wisdom and humility, stayed the Sword already drawn for the desolation of her Family. The Philistines about this time had taken the Field, whom Saul having encountred and driven back, he returns to the pursuit of David, with three thousand men, and en∣tring into a Cave for necessity, where David was hid with a small number of his most faithful Servants, they perswad∣ed him, That by the hand of God his mortal Enemy was now delivered into his power, by whose death he might put an end t all his Calamities; But David by a strong inspiration from God, resolved in his heart never to lay his hands upon Gods Anointed, and contenting himself with only cutting off the Skirts of his Garment, he went out of the Cave after Saul, and cryed after him with a loud voice, saying, Be∣hold my Lord, my Father, and my King the innocence of my hands, and be no more filled with vain and false suspitions of poor David, you cannot be ignorant that God at this time had put me into your power, and that I could have taken away your life to have saved my own, but God by his grace hath preserved me from such ill thoughts and hath secured you from all danger; I had never yet any intent to hurt you, though you cease not to persecute and torment my life with a thousand afflictions; Alas my Lord what is it you desire? Against whom are you come forth with so great a strength of Arms and Horses? against a poor dead Dog, a miserable little Beast? I beseech the living God to be Judge between us, and to make you sensible of the goodness of my cause. Saul was so amazed with this action that he ran to him, and imbracing him weeping, said, This O David is a sure sign whereby I know for certain thou shall reign after me, so great a goodness not being able to be rewarded but by an Empire I only beseech and intreat you to have pity on my poor Children af∣ter my death, and not to revenge upon them the injuries I have offered you; Hereupon he swore to deal peaceably with him for the future; But the Spirit of Saul was unequal and oft departed from reason for a long season; Where∣upon David resolved to go out of the Kingdom to Achish King of the Philistines a Sworn Enemy to Israel, since he could not besecure any where else, yet did he never bear
arms against the people of God: At last the fatal day of Saul drew near, and he saw the Philistines came upon him with their utmost strength, and being troubled in mind, in the confusions of a disturbed Spirit, he sought to the Divine Oracles to learn his destiny in this pressing ne∣cessity, but this unhappy Prince sought after the dead in vain, having trod under feet the admonitions of the Liv∣ing; and therefore he applies himself to the Witch of Endor, who by Samuels appearance foretold the routing of his Army, his own death, and likewise his Childrens sad Fate, at which he was so affrighted that he fell into a Swound. Being recovered, he went to his Army, and the next morning perceived the Philistines wonderfully in∣creased, and resolv'd to fight; And his own people ex∣ceedingly weakened, and seeming to carry misfortune in their faces; The Enemies gave the onset with very great violence, and overthrew the foremost of the Israe∣lites, wherein Jonathan with his two Brethren sealed the last proofs of their valour with their bloud and death in the sight of their miserable Father, who seeing he could not dye so soon as he desired suffered himself to fail upon his own Sword, vomiting, forth his Soul and bloud with ragings and griefs unspeakable. While this unhappy Battel was fought, David was pursuing the Amalakites, who in his absence had sackt the Town of Ziglag the place of his retiring, whom he overtook loaden with their prey, and regained his two Wives Ahinoam and Abigail whom they had taken away; As he came from this Battle, a young Amalekite presents himself, and brings him the news of the death of Saul and Jonathan, and his other Sons, affirming that he him∣self had stood by at the death of the King, and had help∣ed him to die by his own command; Whereat David moved with extream grief, tore his garments, wept, fasted, and made a funeral Lamentation over Saul and Jonathan; Causing likewise the Amalekite to die, who by his own confession was accessary to the death of the King; And though David at this time might have taken posses∣sesion of the Kingdom, yet upon prudent deliberation he
thought it not convenient to be too hasty; Whereupon Abner a chief Captain, without losing time, seeing there yet remained a Son of Saul alive named Ishbosheth, aged forty years, though of little courage, and less under∣standing, he made him presently come into the Camp, and caused him to be proclaimed the true and lawful Successor of Saul, not so much for the love he bore him, or the esteem of his sufficiency, as intending to reign by him and over him. All the People swore Allegiance to Ishbosheth, except the Tribe of Judah from whom David sprung, which joyning together in favour of him, crowned him King in Hebron, where he reigned seven years before he possest the whole Kingdom of Israel. Afterward Abner laying aside his war-like humor, fell in love with a Concubine of Sauls named Rispah, whereat Ishbosheth being offended, Abner for one poor word spoken in a very mild manner, entred into a rage against the King, and said, It was to use him as a Dog to quarrel with him for a woman after so great Services as he had done for the Crown, and from whom he held both his Life and Kingdom; The poor Prince held his peace, and durst not answer a word to this bold Fellow, and was pitifully devoured by his own Servant. Abner grew so hot with anger that he dispatcht Messengers to David to desire his friendship, and promiseth to bring the whole Kingdom of Ishbosheth into his hands. David answered, That he was willing to make peace with him, if he would cause his Wife Michol to be restored to him, whom they had married to another after his departure, which was readily agreed to, and performed. Mean time Abner powerfully sollicites the people of Israel to betake themselves to David, since God had com∣mitted their safety and rest into his hands, who would unite all the Tribes under one Monarchy, which would make him a happiness to his people, helpful to his friends, and terrible to his Enemies. This Discourse prevail'd very much on the Principal ones of the Nation, who saw small hopes of Ishbosheth, he being disparaged both by Nature and Fortune. Soon after Abner meets David
at Hebron, who made him a Feast, hearkned to his Propo∣sitions and conducted him back with honour. Joab who was at that time absent, soon understood the coming of Abner and being jealous that the Friendship of a man who seem'd to draw a whole Kingdom after him might much prejudice his interest he enters roughly into the Kings Chamber, telling him that Abner was but a deceiver who came to spy out his secrets, and that he ought to have se∣cured him when under his power; And since David seeing him in such a rage answered nothing Joab without Authority sends a message to Abner to return to Hebron un∣der colour of treating more fully with David; He lightly believed it, and came back the same way, when Joab trecherously surprizing him killed him at the Gate of the City. David was much perplexed hereat, and uttered grie∣vous Curses against Joab and his whole race, and to de∣face the blemish of this Murder, be assisted at the Fune∣rals of Abner, protesting against the cruelty of those who had taken away his Life, and highly setting forth the praises of the dead; yet he caused not process to be made against Joab, conceiving that he was not able to destroy him in such a time when it was dangerous to provoke him. After this Ishbosheth King of Israel was slain by two Murtherers Rechab and Baanah as he slept on his Bed at Noonday, who cut off his Head and brought it to David, at which this great King was so highly incensed, abhorring this barbarous Fact, that he instantly condemn'd them to death, and their Heads and Feet being cut off, they were hang'd up at the Fishood of Hebron. The death of Ishbosheth the Son of Saul ended the dif∣ference between the two  Houses, and all the Tribes, yielded universally to David; So that now he began to Reign absolutely, and to disscover the Admirable Quali∣ties and Royal Virtues wherewith he was adorned. And it is certain that of all the Kings of Judah, none equall'd him in all kind of perfections. He was one who feared God without Superstition; was Religious without Hypo∣crisie; Valiant without Sternness, Liberal without re∣proaching
any, a good Husband without Covetousness; Valiant without Insolence, Vigilant without Unquiet∣ness, Wise without Subtilty, Courteous without Loos∣ness, Humble without Cowardliness, Cheerful without too much Familiarity, Grave without Fierceness, and Kind without any Complement; Above all he was all his Life very Zealous for Religion, and wonderfully affected toward Divine things, setling the Worship of God, and composing Hymns for the people, which have continued to all Ages, and serve for perpetual Springs of Devotion even to this very day; Yet did these Exercises no way diminish his Actions of Valour; He overthrew the Phi∣listines in two great Battels, and made War on every side, in the East against the Moabites and Amonites, in the West against the Phoenicians, on the South against the Amale∣kites, Arabians, and Idumeans, and in the North against the Syrians, Sabeans and Mesopotamians, and was happy in all his Enterprizes; Besides which he made Leagues with the Kings his Neighbours, which he gained either by Friendship or Force. He rendred Justice exactly to his Subjects, favoured Arts, Inricht and Fortified Towns, Erected Stately Pallaces, and brought the Kingdom of Judah out of Servility, who had not yet known what Mag∣nificence was; He was honoured by the great Ones, be∣loved by the Priests, admired by the Wisest, and al∣most adored by the People. But as all light in mortal things hath a shaddow; God suffered him to fall into a great offence which served to humble him, and caused very much trouble in his House; His mind being freed from the cares of War and Business, he descried from the top of his Pallace a Woman that bathed her self in her Garden, he inquired her name, her Kindred, and her Quality, and becoming in Love thereby, sends for her to his house, and had Company with her; How dear did this unhappy cast of his Eye cost him; When a man once exceeds in this blind Passion, he goes further than ever he designed. She soon after sends word to Da∣vid that she had Conceived, and that her Husband hav∣ing not seen her of a long time, might have very ill ap∣prehensions
of her; The honour of this lost Creature must now be covered, the King sends for her Husband under some other pretence, he comes from the Army, is kindly entertained, and David is earnest with him to go home and take his ease with his Wife, but the good man refuses it, saying, That it was not fit for him to lye in a Bed when the Ark of God and his Captain Joab were under Tents; He lies on the ground before the door of the Kings Chamber, and so passeth the night, having no de∣sire but to return speedily to the Army; Alas poor Ʋriah! thou art made a harmless Sacrifice, and wast but too faithful, and therefore must water with thy bloud the guilt of thy Master! David dictates a bloudy Letter to Joab to place Ʋriah in the Forlorn hope, that he might be fairly rid of him, and Ʋriah carries this deadly Let∣ter; Joab without inquiring obeys, the Innocent Ʋriah is massacred, and these false Lovers now think themselves secure; David remains nine Months covered with this Filth and Bloud, without coming to the knowledge of himself, until Nathan the Prophet removes the Vail that blinded him, who though he knew how dangerous it was to reprove a King, and especially in such a case, yet resolved to shew David his sin, by uttering a Parable of a Rich Man that had great Store of Sheep, who yet had violently taken away one only Ewe from a Poor Man, which David finding very strange, judged him worthy of death, whereat the Prophet hits him home, telling him, He was the Man who had caused poor Uriah to be slain after he had taken Bathsheba from him. David awaking as it were out of a dead sleep, acknowledged his sin with a true humility, and submitted himself to all the Chastise∣ments it should please the great Judge to inflict upon him; He was presently changed into another man, and was exceeding Penitent, his Heart bleeding and his Eyes weeping continually for his grievous offence, and God beginning the punishments of his sin (which yet he had pardoned as to his own person) caused the Child Conceived in Adultery to dye. A year after those pitiful Tragadies of his House
which the Lord had threatned him with, came upon him, and filled his heart with terrors; Amnon the eldest Son of David fell in love with his sister Thamar a very fair Princess, and being in dispair of obtaining his desire, falls sick; The King his Father goes to see him to take order for his health, who tells him; There is but one medicine that will cure him which is that his sister Tha∣mar should come and make him broth with her own hand, wherein she had much skill. This is easily gran∣ted, and the innocent Maid goes to him, who soon dis∣covers his passion to her, which she as violently opposed by reasons and tears; Whereupon this barbarous Man proceeds to force and ravishes her, which being past, he entred into as furious a repentance, and not enduring to behold her, drives her out of his House with re∣proach and sco, she puts on morning attire, and covers her head with ashes and at last discovers all to Absolom her brother by the same Mother, who comforts her, and promises revenge; David hears of it, but remembring his own offence, durst not censure that of his Son, especially since he loved him tenderly and feared to offend him Absolom seeing David did nothing in it, resolved to do himself Justice with his own hands; and having kep his design secret two years to prevent suspition, he makes a Royal Feast to which he invites his Father and all his brethren; David excuses himself, and the other earnestly intreats that his eldest brother Amnon might supply his place, to which his Father consents. The brethren enter joyfully into the Hall where the Banquet was, where Absolom had prepared a Bloudy Spectacle and horrible Sacifice; he gives the word to his Servants that when his brother Amnon had drank plentifully, they should take their opportunity to kill him without in∣quiring the cause, since his Command was sufficient au∣thority and security; The Wine and good cheer having made them merry, on a sudden drawn Swords glittered before their eyes; Fear came upon all, but the danger was only to Amnon who was suddenly Murthered, his
bloud leaping on his Brothers Table for a just revenge of his shameful lust. The Brethren affrighted instantly fly and report brings the sad news to David that Absolon had slain all his Brethren; The poor King casts himself on his face upon the ground weeping, and all the Court tear their cloaths and put on Mourning, when Jonadas certifies that none but Amnon was killed in revenge of the offence committed against Thamar. David returns a little to himself, and his other Children present themselves before him affrighted and weeping for that which had passed. Absolon saves himself in the House of his Grand-Father by the Mother, the King of Geshur, where he remains three years without daring to see the King his Father who would no ways pardon this great Crime. Joab la∣bours to reconcile the Son to the Father by the media∣tion of a discreet Woman of Tekoah, and at length pre∣vails, Absolon returns, the King imbraces him, gives him the kiss of peace and re-establishes him in the Court; The Spirit of this Prince was high and tempestuous, and being well made, courteous, liberal, couragious and capable of great undertakings, he entertained ambitious thoughts; He saw his Father declining, Adonijah his elder Brother too much a fondling, and Solomon yet a Child unable to oppose him, and therefore conceived the Kingdom could not slip out of his hands; And the better to secure it he provided himself a guard of Souldiers and ceased not secretly to gain the hearts and good will of all his Fathers Subjects; Never was any Prince more prodigal of his Courtesies, whoever had any business with the King, he called them to him, imbraced them, kissed them, and enquired of their condition and suit, and said, There was no other mishop but that the King was old and tired with business, and had not appointed any one to hear the Complaints of his Subjects and do them Justice, but if one day he should have that charge due to him by his cirth, he would give full satisfaction to every one. By this means he made himself Conqueror of hearts, and by the advice of Achitophel a great Politicion, gets
leave of David to perform a Vow in Hebron whither he goes accompanied with many of his Followers, giving order to the rest of his Confederates, that at the first sound of a Trumpet they should march to him, which be∣ing done, he caused himself to be crowned King in He∣bron; The news came quickly to David, that his Son had revolted and got possession of Hebron, and that all the For∣ces of the Kingdom ran to him; This poor Prince at the tydings of this Rebellion thinks of nothing but flying, and leaves his chief City to save himself in the by paths of the Wilderness: He is the first that goes forth, with∣out a Horse to ride on, upon his are feet, with his head uncovered and tears in his Eyes, marching thus like a true Penitent, and adoring the Judgments of God, which made him bear the enraged Tongue of Shimei with a deep patience, and would not suffer him to be chastized for his horrid insolence. Mean while Absolon entred Jerusa∣lem without resistance, where Achitophel to make the dif∣ference irreconcileable, gave him the detestable Counsel to abuse his Fathers Concubines that were left in the Pal∣lace; After he had perform'd this Villany, he contrives to surprize his Father at unawares, which by Achitophels subtilty might have probably succeeded, had not Hushai a secret Friend of Davids who joyn'd himself to Absolon on purpose to discover his designs, prevented the Plot by this cunning speech, That they should do nothing hastily, since his Father was an old Captain, and politick in War, who had still in his Army men of Valour and Counsel, and that it stood not with his honour to give Battle unless he were assured of the Victory, for if at the first Encounter he should be repulsed, it would be of dangerous consequence, and might so discourage his men, that his whole Army might be routed, but if he would stay a while, the People would gather to him as the Sand on the Sea shore, and being in the midst of such a mighty Army, nothing would be able to stand before him. This Counsel being pre∣ferr'd before Achitophels, he was so inraged that he goes instantly home and hangs himself, by the most manifest Justice of God. After which Absolon thinking himself sufficiently strong, passes over Jordan, makes Amasa his
chief Captain, and designs to give Battle to his Earler; David having had a little leisure to recollect and fortifie himself, takes Courage again, and dividing his Army in∣to three parts, appoints Joab, Abishai, and Ittai to com∣mand it; He would have been present himself had not his Council disswaded him, therefore encouraging his people, and charging them strictly if they should gain the Victory to secure his Son Absolon without any hurt, he retired out of the Camp. The Trumpets sound, and the Armies approach Da∣vids men having a good Cause, ingage like Lions; But the Rebels affrighted with their own guilt, were soon dis∣ordered, and put to flight, so that one Party seemed to come only to kill, and the other to be slain, Twenty thousand falling dead on the place; Absolon astonisht at this sudden change of Fortune, gets on his Mule and flies through a Forrest where his head being caught within the branches of a Tree, his Mule left him hanging be∣tween Heaven and Earth; as a spectacle of the Vengeance of God for his ingratitude to so good a Father; Of which Joab having notice, struck him through with three Darts, though forbidden by David, and ten young Souldiers made an end of him, the body, was interred in a Pit under a great heap of Stones, though he had built a stately Monument for himself which he called Absolons Place. Behold the horrible end of an Evil Son and a Rebellious Subject, sufficient to deter Posterity from such wicked practices to the end of the World. While this was doing, David inclosed himself in a little Town, expecting the Event, and continually inquiring of the health of Absolon, but when certain news came of his death, he was pierced with so violent a grief, that he could not be comforted, losing all Courage, and cry∣ing every moment, O Absolon my Son Absolon, Oh that this favour had been done for me that I might have died for thee! Every one cast down his Eyes for pity, and the whole Victory was turned into sorrow. Joab always bold and insolent toward his Master, re∣proaches David, thinking thereby to justify his own fault,
telling him, That he would put to confusion all his faithful Ser∣vants who had that day saved his Life, his House, and Kingdom, that he seemed of a very strange nature, to hate those that loved him, and love them that hated him, since it was plain that if all his good Captains and Souldiers had perished to save the life of one Rebellious Son he would have been very well satisfied; Fur∣ther he swore to him by the Living God, That if he did not rise, and entertain those who returned from the Battel, there would not one man remain with him before morning, which would prove a greater displeasure than had ever yet happened to him. He presses him so vehemently that the King without daring to answer a word rose up, and did all he required; By degrees his great grief diminished, and the rejoicings of the people who came to carry him back to Jerusalem in triumph made him forget his loss, and endeavouring to bring back all to him, he pardoned them with unspeaka∣ble meekness, being ready to give Joabs place to Amasa Absolons chief Captain; But Joab quickly prevented this, by killing with his own hand him who was designed his Successor. After this he pursued Sheba a Captain of the Rebels who retired into Adela, which being besieged by Joab, a Woman of great discretion and credit with the people perswaded them to slay him and throw his head over the Wall which put an end to this whole bloudy War. After Davids re-establishment in his Kingdom, he reigned about Eleven years in full peace, and in continual exercises of Piety and Justice, and assembling the States of his Realm, he made his Son So∣lomon whom he had chosen, to be confirmed King in his stead; He lived near seventy two years, reigned forty, and died a thousand thirty two years before the Birth of our Saviour, and about three thousand from the Creation of the World, leaving vast Treasures for building the Temple, as an Eternal, Monument of his Devotion and Understanding; It was a special favour to him that Jesus Christ should be born of his Line, and that his Birth was revealed to him so long before it was known to the world; He oft sets it down on the ide of his Psalms, and was in an Extasie in Contemplation by the foretast of this happiness; Men usually take their Nobility and Names from their Predecessors, but David drew his from a Son who is the Father of Glory and Author of Eternity; All things were great in Davids Person but the height of all this greatness is that from his Family there was given to us a Jesus.
The Hist. of Judas Maccabeus a Valiant Comman∣der of the Jews; The Sixt Worthy of the World. portrait of Judas Maccabeus This Valiant Worthy for his Countreys Cause And in defending of Gods Truth and Laws Was still ingag'd, and often with a few He Thousands of his Enemies did subdue. Their Number nor their strength he did not fear Hoping that God would still for him appear Who fought his Battels; And would ne're comply To wicked Heathenish Idolatry. At length forsook by almost all his men His Courage would not suffer him, even then To fly away, but being with killing tir'd He dearly sold his life, and so expir'd.
AFter the death of Alexander the Great, his Army and Dominions were divided between his Captains, among whom Seleucus made himself King of Syria, And afterward Antiochus Epiphanius reigned in Asia, who being invited by some Apostate Jews to come to Jerusalem, he incamped before it, and by his Faction within had the gates opened and the City betrayed to him, about the year of the World 3796. and before the Nativity of Christ 168. He robbed the Temple, and carried away the Golden Table, Candlestick and Censers, with all the other vessels dedicated to God, leaving nothing of any value behind him, and raising such an horrible per∣secution against the Jews, that the Heavens seemed to weep, and the Earth to blush with Bloud; It was a sport to that barbarous man to prophane Holy things, and a continual exercise to flea and roast men alive, or to throw them into boiling Caldrons, for no other crime but per∣sisting in the True Religion, as he did by the Seven Sons of the Maccabees, whose courage and constancy out-brav'd all his most exquisite Tortures. He overturned the Al∣tars upon the bleeding Priests, strangled the Children in the bosom of their sighing Mothers, the Flames devoured the sacred and prophane Buildings without distinction, and the Houses that now seemed but Dens of Beasts, re∣presented so hideous a spectacle as gave more desire to die than courage to live. Amidst these desolations was found a gallant Old man named Matthias a Priest, the Father of many Sons, all men of valour, who went out of Jerusalem to retire him∣self to the City of Modin, where he assembled his Fa∣mily, resolving to oppose themselves against the fury of the Tyrant, but was quickly summoned to render up himself and all his men, and to offer Incense to their Pa∣gan Idols; But this virtuous man, calling his people to∣gether, spake thus to them; We should be too much in love with Life, to keep it with the loss of the True Religion; I am sorry that ever I was born in such an Age as to have seen the disasters of my Nation, and the desolation of the Holy Jerusa∣lem, abandoned to the hands of Rapine and to impious propha∣nation;
Her Temple hath been the Object of all reproaches, and those Vessels of Glory that served for the Ministry of the Living God have been taken away by violence; We have seen our Streets covered with dead Bodies, and the little Children with their Throats cut lying upon the Carcasses of their Fathers; And what Nation hath not possessed our Inheritance, and enriched themselves with our Spoils; The holiness of the Temple hath not stayed Sacriligious hands, neither hath this famous City been able to preserve it self from Flames; After this what pleasure can we have in Life, unless it be to revenge the quarrel of God? I am promised all the honours and priviledges I can rea∣sonably hope for, if I will obey King Antiochus, and joyn with those Apostates who have so basely betrayed their Faith, but God forbid that I should ever fall into so odious a compliance; When almost all my Nation have conspired to forsake the Law of their God, and accommodate themselves to the times, and their Princes will, I can answer for my self, my Children, and my Brethren, and can assure my self they will never commit so vild a crime. Let all those who have a Zeal for True Re∣ligion joyn themselves with us, and know that among so many miseries there is nothing better than to proceed in the ways of Religion and Glory, though with the loss of our dearest bloud and life. In the mean time the Kings Commissioners pressing every one to declare himself, one of the Jews, whether induced by terror, or reward, steps forth from among the people to sacrifice according to the command of the King, wherewith Matthias inflamed with Zeal, was so displeased, that he and his Sons fell upon him, and hewed him in pieces, they also slew Apollos the Kings Captain and other Souldiers who withstood them; Then he overthrew the Altar, and with a loud voice said, All that are affected to the Laws of their Fathers, and the Ser∣vice of God, let them follow me; Whereupon many of them retired with their Wives and Children into the Desarts and Caves, but were soon pursued and overtaken by the Kings Captains, who again renewed their perswasions to them to offer Sacrifice to the Idols, which the Jews absolutely refusing, and resolving rather to die than
commit such Impiety, these bloudy Persecutors assault∣ed them on the Sabbath day, and burnt them in their Caves, who neither resisted nor defended themselves lest they should prophane the Sabbath; Some thou∣sands of Men, Women and Children were there destroy∣ed, yet divers escaped who joyned themselves with Matthias, and chose him for their Captain, who then inform'd them that they might lawfully fight on the Sabbath if they were assaulted, else they were guilty of their own deaths; And having assembled a sufficient number, he destroyed the Heathen Altars, and slew those who had forsaken their Religion, commanding them to circumcise their Children, and driving from every place those whom Antiochus had appointed to see the Laws executed. Having thus governed one year, he fell sick and per∣ceiving his death to approach he sent for his five Sons, John, Simeon, Judas Maccabeus, Eleazer and Jonathan, whom he earnestly exhorted to follow his steps its maintaining the Law of God, and fighting for their Countrey, assuring them of the divine assistance which never fails those who love and fear God, but taking pleasure in their virtues will grant them favour to recover their former liberty and peace; And saith he, God will establish you in the pos∣session of your ancient Laws, and though our bodies are mortal and subject to death, yet the memory of our virtuous actions will remain to eternity, never doubt therefore to venture your lives in so good a Cause, but above all I exhort you to love and concord, and whatever you find any one most apt and fitted for, let him prosecute the same, without contradiction from the rest. I charge you to obey your brother Simeon a politick and valiant man, in what ever he shall Counsel you, but make Judas Mac∣cabeus your Captain who is couragious and strong, for he shall revenge the injuries and outrages that have been done to our Nation, and shall put your Enemies to flight; Assist him there∣fore like men of valour, and such as fear God, and thereby you shall be sure to prevail. Soon after Matthias gave up the Ghost, and Judas Maccabus was made General, who by the assistance of
his Brethren and other Jews, drove the Enemy out of the Country, and cleansed the Land of Idolatry; Which when Apollonius the General of Antiochus in Samaria heard, he invaded Judea; Against whom Maccabeus went forth, and in a terrible Battle, overthrew and killed Apollonius, taking his Camp and therein a very rich Booty, together with his Sword. After this, Seron Governour of Coelosy∣ria with the assistance of many Apostate Jews, marcht against Judas to Bthoron, who observing his Souldiers discouraged by their great numbers, and because they had fasted so long, and were thereby disabled, he in∣couraged them, saying, That Victory did not consist in numbers of men, but in their Devotion toward God, who had so assisted their Forefathers, that with small Forces they had often defeated many thousands of their Enemies; They were hereby so prevail'd upon, that without sear of their multitude they ran all upon Sevon, routed his Army and slew him, together with eight hundred of the Syrians, the rest escaping by flight. Antiochus inraged at this defeat, commanded Lysias the Governour of Egypt to go with a very strong Army and conquer Judea, and then to sell the Inhabitants for Slaves to those that would give most, and utterly to de∣stroy and ruine Jerusalem; Lysias having this command, sent Prolomy, Nicanor and Gorgias, men of great Authority, about the King, with Forty thousand Foot, and Seven thousand Horse to invade Judea, who marching to the City of Emaus, greatly increased their Forces. Judas having viewed the Camp and number of his Enemies, exhorted his Souldiers to repose their confidence and hope of Victory in God alone, appointing likewise a Fast to humble themselves before God by supplications and prayers in such a time of extream danger, and assuring them that God would have compassion on them and strengthen them to put their Adversaries to sham; Next day he mustered his Army, discharging all who were newly married, or had lately bought Possessions, according to the Law, and then spake thus to the rest; Countrymen and Companions, we had never more occasion to
express our Courage, and contemn Dangers than at this present; For if you now fight valiantly, you may in this one Battle recover your Liberties, whereby you will have opportunity again to serve the True God, and live a happy life; But if you prove Cowards in this Encounter, you will be branded with perpetual Infamy, and indanger the utter extirpation of your Nation; Consider therefore that if you fight not you must die, and on the contrary assure your selves that in fighting for your Religion, Laws and Liberties, you shall obtain Immortal Glory, Be ready Theerfore in the morning to give your mortal Enemies Battle. Immediately news was brought him that a strong party of Horse and Foot were design'd to fal on him that night, whereupon Maccabeus suddenly resolved to break into the Enemies Army the same night while they were so divided; Having therefore refreshed himself and his Army, and leaving many Fires in his Camp to deceive the Enemy, he marcht all night to seek them out; Gorgias finding the Jews had forsaken their Camp, imagined that they were fled to the Mountains for fear, and deligently pursued them; But in the morning Judas with only three thousand men, ill armed, shewed him∣self to the Enemy at Emaus, and having observed their posture, he perswaded his men, To fight Valiantly since he was certain God would deliver their Enemies into their hands, and thereupon causing his Trumpets to sound he fell up∣on them with, such fury and resolution that being abso∣lutely affrighted and surprized they instantly gave ground, and having slain such as resisted, he pursued the rest to the Plains of Idumea; In this fight three thousand of the Enemy were Killed, yet would he not suffer his Soul∣diers to take the spoil, telling them, that they were still to fight with Gorgias and his Army, whom when by Gods help they had beaten, they should then securely inrich themselves with the booty; Gorgias and his Army observ∣ing from a Hill the flight of their Fries, and the readi∣ness of the Jews to give them battel, were so discourag'd that they fled likewise, whereupon Judas and his men re∣turn'd to gather the Pillage, where finding great store of
Gold, Silver, Scarlet and Purple, they return'd home with Joy, praising God for their good success. Lysias was extreamly concerned at this overthrow, and presently invaded Judea with Sixty thousand Chosen Foot, and five thousand Horse, and incamped in Bethsura. Which Judas hearing, came out against him with only ten thousand men, and seeing their number so vastly exceed his, he cryed earnestly to God that he would please to fight with him and for him, and then charged the front of the Enemy with such force, that he discomfited and slew above five thousand of them. Ly∣sias perceiving the resolution of the Jews who would ra∣ther dye than lose their liberty. He returned with the rest of his Army to Antioch to reinforce them. Mean while Judas assembled the People, and told them, That having obtained so many Victorys through the mercy of God, they ought now to go up to Jerusalem, and purifie the Temple that was desolate, and to offer Sacrifices according to the Law of the Lord; Then going up with a great multitude of People, he found the Temple desolate, the gates burnt, and grass growing within the same; At this sad spectacle he and all present could not forbear weeping, and presently applyed themselves to purge the Temple; Then Judas caused a Table, a Candlestick, and an Altar for Incense to be made all of Gold, putting up a Rail, and Gates to the Temple, and throwing down the Altar which was prophaned by Antiochus, he built a new one of stones neither Newed nor Hammered; And on the twenty first of Chasleu, or September, lights were put in the Candlesticks, perfumes layd upon the Altar, Loaves set upon the Ta∣ble, and Sacrifices offered upon the New Altar, which had been neglected for three years past; Then did Judas and his Countrymen celebrate a Feast unto the Lord for eight days, praising God with Hymns and Psalms, He also inclosed Jerusalem with a Wall, and built  Towers thereon in which he planted Garrisons against the incursions of the Enemy, and fortified Bethsura for a defence to it. The Nations ound about envying this prosperity of
the Jews, surprized many of them by Treachery, where∣upon Judas made an incursion, slew many Idumeans, and brought a great prey out of their Countrey, besieg∣ing the Sons of Baan their Prince who lay in wait for the Jews, and at length setting fire to their Towers, killed all that were therein. After this he overcame a mighty Army of the Ammorites under the command of Timotheus, taking and burning their City of Jazor, and leading their Wives and Children Captive into Judea. The Neigh∣bouring People hearing of his departure assaulted the Jews and Galaad, who retiring into the Fort of Dathema, sent to Judas for relief; And at the same time Letters came out of Galilee, that they were indangered by the Inhabitants of Ptolemais, Tyre, Sydon, and others there∣about. Judas hereupon sent his Brother Simeon with three thousand chosen men to relieve Galilee, and himself with his Brother Jonathan, and eight thousand others, march∣ed to Galaad; Simeon fought against his Enemies in Ga∣lilee, and slew about three thousand, pursuing them to the Gates of Ptolemais, and taking much spoil, and releasing many Jewish Prisoners he returned victoriously home. But Judas passing Jordan, was there inform'd that his Brethren were Besieged in their Cities and Castles, and some already in great extremity; Hereupon he first fell upon the Inhabitants of Bozra, took their City, set it on fire, and kill'd all able to bear Arms; Then marching all night he arrived early next morning to the Castle where the Jews were Besieged by the Army of Timotheus, who were just ready to scale the Walls, when Judas di∣viding his Forces into three Battalions, couragiously as∣sailed them, who hearing it was Maccabeus, were surprised with such dread that they instantly fled; Judas his men slaying about eight thousand in the pursuit; Then marching to Molla he seized it, slew all the men therein and burnt it with Fire, after which he destroy'd several other places. Soon after Timotheus raised another Army, wherewith he marched to Jordan, exhorting them valiantly to op∣pose the Jews, and to hinder their passage over the Ri∣ver,
since if they once past Jordan, they were sure to be defeated. Judas hearing this, marched hastily against the Enemy, and passing the River, unexpectedly fell upon them with such violence, that casting away their Arms they fled for their lives, some endeavoured to save themselves in Carnain, but Judas taking that City and Temple, slew them, and burnt the same, and then he led away all the Jews who dwelt in Galaad with their Wives, Children and substance, and brought them into Judea. When he drew near the Town of Ephion, they had barricado'd up his way that he could not pass, and refusing upon his desire to open the passage, he Besieg∣ed the City, took it by assault, burnt it, and slew all the Inhabitants. After this passing over Jordan they came in∣to Judea with great joy and gladness praising God, and Offering Sacrifices of Thanksgiving for the safe return of the Army, because in all these Batrles and Encounters they had not lost one Jew. But whilst Judas and Simeon were gone upon these expeditions, the two Captains with whom he had left the rest of his Forces (with a strict command to have a watchful Eye over Judea. but not to join Battle with any Enemy till his return) being de∣sirous to gain the repute of valiant men, went out with their Souldiers toward Jamnia, against whom Gorgias Governor of that place issued out, and slew two thou∣sand of them, the rest flying back into Judea. Then Judas and his Brethren took divers Cities from the Idu∣means, and with much Booty and great Joy returned home. The Bloudy Antiochus being at this time in Persia, heard of a wealthy City called Elymais, wherein stood a rich Temple of Diana; Thither he went and beseiged it, but the Inhabitants sallied out, and with great loss drove him from thence, whereupon he returned to Babylon, where having notice of the overthrow of his Captains in Judea, and the power of the Jews, this with his former defeat so wrought upon him that he fell sick, and finding no hope of recovery, he called his most familiar Friends about him, telling them, That he was plagued with this vio∣lent
and desperate affliction for tormenting the Jews. destroying the Temple, committing horrid Sacriledge, and contemning the True God; But now he vowed if it pleased the Lord to restore him, he would become a Jew, and do many great things for them, and would go through all the known World to declare th power of God; Who knowing his hyprocrisy, continued to plague him in a terrible manner▪ He had an intollerable pain and torment in his bowels and inward paits from whence issued abundance of Worms continually crawling out, so that he rotted above ground with such an intol∣lerable stink, that none could come near him, neither could himself indure it; And thus this vile Person who had insolently boasted he would make Jerusalem a com∣mon Burying place, and the streets thereof run with the Bloud of Gods People, by his just Judgment ended his life in extream misery; Before his death he made Philip his Cheif Captain Governor of his Kingdom, requiring him to be very careful of his Son Antiochus. Then was Antiochus proclaimed King, and Sirnamed Eupator; About which time the Apostate Jews in garrison at Jerusalem did much mischief, slaying those unawares who came to Worship and offer Sacrifices in the Temple; Judas hereupon resolved to cut them off, and according∣ly besieged the Fort with his Army, when some of the beseiged escaping by night, went and desired Antiochus not to suffer those to perish who for his Fathers sake had forsaken their God and their Religion; who thereupon sent a mighty Army of an hundred thousand foot; twenty thousand Horse, and thirty two Elephants under Lysias their Captain, to relieve them, who sate down be∣fore Bethsura a strong City, but were valiantly resisted by the inhabitants who fallied out and burnt the Engines prepared for battery; Whereupon Judas raising his seige before the Castle of Jerusalem, marched to∣ward the Enemy, who preparing to meet him, Antiochus then present caused his Elephants to march first through the narrow passage where Judas was incamped, each Elephant having a thousand Foot and an hundred Horse for his guard with a Tower
on his back furni with Archers; The rest of his Forces were ordere march by the Mountains, and with great shouts to al their Enemies, and by uncover∣ing their brazen and golden Bucklers to dazel the eyes of the Jews; Yet was Judas no way disturbed, but in∣couraging his Army slew six hundred of the Forlorn Hope; Eleazer the Brother of Judas seeing a huge Ele∣phant with Royal trappings, and judging the King was on him, having with a noble courage slain those about him, thrust his Sword into the belly of the Beast, who sudden∣ly falling, slew him with his weight. Judas observing the great strength of the Enemy, matcht back to Jeruslem, Antiochus following him, and taking Bethsura by Treaty for want of provisions and dis∣pairing of relief, they having the Kings Oath that no vio∣lence should be offered them, yet he thrust them out of the City and put a Garrison therein. He lay long be∣fore the Temple of Jerusalem, the besieged defending it gallantly, only they wanted Victuals the Land not having been tilled for seven years before, whereupon divers se∣cretly fled, and few remain'd to defend the Temple, when by Gods providence, Antiochus had news that Phi∣lip his Fathers Governor was coming out of Persia to make himself Lord of his Countrey; Whereupon Antiochus sent an Herald to Judas, promising the Jews peace and the liberty of their Religion; Which Judas accepting, and taking the Kings Oath for the true performance thereof, he surrendred up the Temple to Antiochus, who entring the same, and finding it so impregnable a place, he con∣trary to his Oath commanded the Wall that incompassed it to be levell'd, and so returned to Antioch with Onias the High Priest, whom by the counsel of Lysias be put to death, because he had advised his Father to inforce the Jews to forsake their Religion; A just reward for so wick∣ed a Fact. Philip having Conquered much of his Countrey, An∣tiochus marcht against him, fought with him and slew him. Soon after Demetrius Son of Seleucus took Tripolis in Syria, and declaring himself King, invaded the Kingdom of
Antiochus, to whom the people generally submitting, seiz∣ed on Antiochus and Lysias, and bringing them to Demetrius he caused them to be slain; To this new King, divers Jews, banished for their impiety, together with Alcimus the High Priest resorted, accusing Judas Maccabeus, his bre∣thren, and the rest of the Nation for killing their Friends, and banishing such as were for Demetrius; Who much moved with these reports, sent a great Army under Bac∣chides a Valiant and Experienced General to destroy Ju∣das and his Confederates; He marching into Judea sent to Judas pretending to make peace with him, who ob∣serving him to have such strong Forces, would not trust to his false promises, though some of the people did, having his Oath for their protection, but paid dear for their credulity, for he slew threescore of them at one time. Then going from Jerusalem he seized and put to death many Jews, commanding the rest to obey Aleimus the High-Priest, who by his feigned and familiar deport∣ment drew many wicked Jews to join with him, and then marched through the Countrey slaying all who were for Judas, who seeing many upright men thus causlesly killed, he with his Army went through the Land, and flew all the Apostates that were of Alcimus his Faction; He thereupon going to Demetrius, made grievous com∣plaints against Judas, and shewing how dangerous it would be to the State if he went thus on; Demetrius there∣upon sent an Army against Judas under Nicanor, com∣manding him not to spare any one of the Nation of the Jews. Nicanor coming to Jerusalem, offered no act of hostility, but endeavouring to intrap Judas by subtilty, sent him a peaceable Message, protesting he degned no injury, but came only to express the good affections of Demetrius to the Jewish Nation. Judas and his Brethren deceived with these fair pretences, entertained him and his Army, and Nicanor saluting Judas, whilst they were in discourse, he gave a sign to his Souldiers to seize him, but Judas discovering the Treason, escaped from him, and got to his Army; Upon which Nicanor proclaimed open War
against him, and fought him near Caper-Salama, where e obtained the Victory, and constrained Judas to re∣etreat into the Fortress of Jerusalem, where Nicanor esieged him a while, and then retired; At which time certain of the Priests and Elders met him, and having given him reverence, they showed him the Sacrifices they intended to offer to God for the Kings prosperity; But Demetrius blaspheming, threatned them if they did not deliver Judas into his hands, at his return he would de∣stroy the Temple; Hereupon the Priests wept abundant∣ly, beseeching God to defend the Temple and his True Worshipers from the outrage of their Enemies. Nicanor coming near Bethhoron, received a great supply of Souldiers out of Syria; Judas likewise was not far off with about a thousand men, yet exhorting his Souldiers to trust in God, and not fear the multitude of their Enemies, he couragiously encountred Nicanor, where the Conflict was doubtful, yet at last Judas had the advan∣tage, killing a great number of his Enemies; Nicanor himself fighting valiantly was slain, whereupon his Army fled, and Judas speedily pursuing, made a great slaugh∣ter, and by sounding a Trumpet giving notice to the Neighbouring places, the Inhabitants armed themselves and killed those that fled, so that not one escaped from this Battle, though they were at least Nine thousand men; After this the Jews had some rest; But Alcimus the High Priest intending to beat down the old Wall of the Sanctuary, was suddenly strucken by God, became speechless, and fell to the ground, and having suffered grievous torments many days he died miserably; Whereupon the People by general consent chose Judas Maccabeus High Priest, who hearing of the great power and Victorys of the Romans sent two Persons to Rome to make them his Allies and Confederates, and to write to Demetrius to give over his Wars against the Jews. These Ambassadors coming to Rome were entertained by the Senate, and an Alliance was concluded upon these conditions, That none under the Romans should War against the Jews nor furnish their Enemies with Victuals, Ships, nor
Silver; That if any made War on the Romans, the Jews should assist them; That the Jews should neither add nor dimini from this Association, without the general consent of  Romans, and that what was thus concluded should contit forever. The death of Nicanor, and the loss of his Army be∣ing reported to Demetrius, he sent another unde Bacchides, who coming into Judea, and hearing tha Judas was incamped at Bethzeth, he marched again him with twenty thousand Foot, and two thousan Horse; Judas had not in all above two thousand me who seeing the vast number of their Foes were muc afraid, so that many forsaking the Camp fled away, an there remained with Judas only eight hundred me and his Enemies pressed so hard on him that he l no time to re-assemble his Forces, yet he resolved  fight with that small handful, exhorting them to behav themselves valiantly; Who answering, That they we not able to make head against so great an Army, advise him to retire, and stand on his guard till he had re inforced himself; Judas replied, God forbid that the  should see me turn my back upon mine Enemies, though die and spend my last Bloud in this Battel, yet will I neve blemish my former Worthy actions by an ignominious flight And having again encouraged his Souldiers, he com∣manded them to use their utmost courage again the Enemy without any apprehension of danger. Bacchides marshalled his Army in Battalia, and ca∣sing the Trumpets to sound, and his Souldiers to make  great Shout, he charged his enemies; Judas did the like, and encountred Bacchides upon which there ensued a most bloudy Fight which continued till Sun-set. Juda perceiving that Bacchides and the flower of his Army fought in the right wing, drew his most resolute Souldier thither, who brake in upon them, and forcing them to fly, pursued them to Mount Aza; But the left wing fol∣lowed Judas and inclosed him on the back part, so that finding himself in much danger, he with his Fol∣lowers resolved to sell their lives dearly and fight it out
to the last; He slew a great number of his Enemies, ill at length he was so wearied with killing that he ell to the ground and was there slain, upon which his ew remaining companions betook themselves to flight, Simeon, and Jonathan his Brothers recovered his Body and buried it at Modin, all the people weeping and making great lamentation for the death of so valiant  Commander, for whatsoever Virtue hath of great, what∣soever valour hath of generous met in the person of Judas Maccabeus to make a Marvel of his life, and give mmortal memory to his Name. In the space of six years be sustained the great and prodigious Forces of three Kings of Asia as you have heard, opposing him∣self with a little flying Camp, against Armies of forty, sixty, an hundred thousand men which he put into dis∣order and confusion; He defeated nine Generals of the Infidels in ranged battles and combates, killing some with his own hands, and carrying away their Spoils, so that of all his great Qualities, Valour always held, the upper rank, and worthily entitled him to the name of a Worthy.
The History of Arthur King of Brittain. The Seventh Worthy of the World. portrait of King Arthur Arthur the Great and Worthy Brittish King Glory and Victory to his Realm did bring. He th' Heathen Saxons often overcame, Inducing them to own the Christian Name. He while he lived upheld the Sinking State, And Conquest seem'd upon him still to wait, His Subjects Love he thereby doth attain, And he must chuse one after him to Reign. The Pictish King this Choice doth much resent As if to wrong him of his Rights they meant Both Kings ingage in Fight, where both Kings dy'd With Thousands of their Subjects on each side.
THe Brittish Writers have related such Strange and Miraculous Actions and Adventures of this Wor∣hy Prince, that many Intelligent Men have been apt to think that all which hath been written of his He∣roicks deeds is meer Fiction and Invention, yea some are of opinion that there never was any such Person, but though Historians disagree about times and places, some writing carelesly and others su∣perstitiously, yet they all agree upon the Prede∣cessors and Successors of this Noble King, but as it is most execrable Infidelity to doubt that there was a Joshua; Wicked Atheism to question if there were a David, and unreasonable to deny the being of Judas Maccabcus; As it may be judged folly to affirm there was never any Alexander, Julius Caesar, Godfrey of Bullen or Charle∣magne, so we may be thought guilty of incredulity and ingratitude to deny or doubt the honourable Acts of our Victorious Arthur. This is premised in vindication of our Hero, and his immortal name and fame, whereby he justly gained the Title of the Seventh Worthy of the World. Now to his History. After this Kingdom had for above four hundred and eighty years been subject to the Romans which began by the Conquest that Julius Caesar made here in the Reign of Cassibelan King of the Brittains seventeen years before the birth of our Blessed Saviour, and ended in the time of the Emperor Gratianus, three hundred seventy six years after Christ; Vortigern of the bloud Royal of the Brittish Kings, by usurpation, and the Murther of Constance the Son of Constantius, seized upon the Crown, who growing odious and hateful to his Subjects both for his wicked life and ill got Soveraignty, he was forced to send to Germany for the Saxons to aid and support him; The Saxons at this time possest the third part of Germany, hold∣ing all the Countreys between the River Rhine and Elbe, bounded on the North by the Baltick Sea and the Ocean, and governed by twelve Princes who elected a Soveraign Leader and General in time of War; This being so spa∣rious, populous and near a Countrey, well furnisht
with Shipping, which the Brittains wanted, yielded al∣ways plentiful supplies to the undertakers of this action who were first Two brothers Hengist and Horsa; After they had continued here a while as hired Souldiers, and observed the weakness both of Prince and People, their number dayly increased; At first they had only the Isle of Thanet allowed them to inhabit, but soon after the whole County of Kent was made over to them upon condition they should defend the Land against the Picts and Scots; And in short time greater priviledges were granted them upon Vortigerns marrying the daughter of Hengist an ex∣ceeding beautiful Lady, who was brought over on purpose to steal away the heart of a dissolute Prince, so that by tha alliance, and the fruitfulness of the Countrey so many  this populous and Military Nation came in, that Kent i a little while grew too narrow for them, and Hengist  extend their power into all parts of the Kingdom, per∣swaded Vortigern to plant a Colony of them in the Nort beyond Humber, to be a continual guard against all inva∣sions on that side; Which being granted he sends fo Occa his Brother and his Son Ebusa to manage that design and hereby the Saxons came to possess Kent and Northum be∣land, which contained all the Countrey from the Rive Humber to Scotland. And now of Servants they became Masters, contem∣ing their Entertainers, and committing many insolen∣cies, whereupon the Brittish Nobility combine together and resolve to depose Vortigern, the Author of this incon∣siderate admission of Strangers, and to chuse Vortimer  Son in his stead, a Prince of great worth, who whil he lived gave them many fierce encounters; but all pre∣vailed not, for the Saxons being possest of the chief Ga of the Land which lay open to their own Countrey  receive continual supplies from thence without resistan had the advantage to weary them all out at last; And beside force they are said to have used treachery in mur∣thering three hundred of the Brittish Nobility at Ans∣bury (where they innocently met to treat of a peace with them) took their King Prisoner, and would not release
im, but upon granting them three Provinces more; Also the long life of Hengist, a Politick General, who ved almost forty years, made much for the setling heir Dominion here, which was not effected with∣ut a great deal of labour and much effusion of loud. For the Brittaines being by continual Wars made ex∣ert in Military discipline, grew at length so inraged to e their Countrey ravished from them by Forreigners, hat they sold their Liberties and Inheritance at a very ear rate. Wherein much must be attributed to the courage nd gallantry of their Leaders from whom the Spirit and alour of a people doth usually proceed, of whom none re more worthy to be remembred than Aurelius Ambrosius e last of the Romans, and our worthy Prince Arthur e Noblest of the Brittains; A man in conduct and va∣ur almost above a man, and worthy of eternal memo∣y, who while he stood, bore up the sinking state of his ountrey. He was the Son of Ʋter Pendragon by the ir Igrene, and during his life had continual War ith the Saxons and the Picts and Scots who were some∣mes confederate with them; In the beginning of his eign the two Kings of these two Nations seemed to envy s advancement to the Crown of Brittain, Loth King  the Picts having married the elder sister of Aurelius mbrosius, and Vortigern, and Conran King of Scots e younger, and because Arthur was begot out of wed∣ck, though his Mother was after married to Ʋter ey thought it more reasonable the Kingdom should de∣end to their Sisters Son than to him; Whereupon Loth nt Ambassadors to the Brittish Lords and Nobility re∣iring that according to the ancient Laws, and Cus∣ms of this Realm they should receive him as King who nd Married the Sister and Heir of the two brethren Am∣osius and Ʋter their last Kings. The Erittains received is Message with great scorn, disdaining to think of sub∣iting to a stranger, and dispatching the Ambassadors ith many reproaches against Loth and the Picts they pro∣claimed
Arthur King of the Realm who raising a potent Army marched instantly against the Saxons, hoping to engage them before the Picts should join, which doubt∣less they would do suddenly; Having therefore procu∣red more aid from Armorica, or little Brittain in France, they met with the Saxons within ten Miles of London, whom they vanquisht in two set battels, and obliged them to pay Tribute, and receive such Governors over them as Arthur should appoint, with several other very hard con∣ditions, to the great rejoicing of the Brittains for such pro∣sperous and happy success under their new elected King. After this the Brittains easily took London, where Ar∣thur continued for some time in consultation with his Nobility and Commanders how they should proceed it their Wars against the rest of the Saxons; Having a length prepared a mighty Army, Arthur resolved to ge against those beyond Humber in the North, with whom the Picts had concluded a League, whereby they were obliged to assist each other against their Common Ene∣mies the Brittains. Arthur marching into Yorkshire, in∣camped near the Enemy, who were already joined to∣gether, and resolving to fight the next day, he appoin∣ted Howel Commander of the French Brittaines to ingage the Picts, while himself dealt with the Saxons; The battel was very furious, and for some time the Victory was doubtful, but at length the Picts were put to flight which the Saxons perceiving, and thinking themselves unable to bear the whole Force of the Brittains, they like∣wise left the Field, and fled with all speed toward York Arthur pursuing them, beseiged that City almost three months, the Saxons valiantly defending it, and making brisk sallies upon the Besiegers, but at length provisions growing very scarce, they were just ready to have surren∣dred, when notice was given them, that a strong Army of Picts and Saxons were coming to their relief toge∣ther with Occa who escaping into Germany from the last battel, was newly arrived with fresh Forces in the River of Humber, whereupon the Saxons refused to treat any further, not doubting but the Brittains would be quickly
forc't to raise the seige, and be glad to get off with their own lives. Arthur having Intelligence of these Succors, and judg∣ing it no wisdom to stay for their coming, considering how many of his Souldiers were diseased and sick by lying so long in the Field, raised his seige, and went in∣to Wales, where leaving the French Brittains to quarter that Winter, he with his choice Troops marched to London to prevent any disturbance from the Kentish Saxons, or others. In the Spring having mustered his Forces he proceeded against Colgern and Occa the two Saxon Generals, who coming out of Northumberland was∣ed and destroyed the Brittish borders with their usual Cruelty; Whereupon Arthur encountring them twice in attel, overcame in both, and then again beseiging York  at length got possession thereof by means of a Brittain, who living among the Saxons within the City, privately et in some Brittains in the dead of the night, who break∣ing open the gates, gave entrance to the whole Army; Arthur would not suffer many of the Saxons to be slain, but ardoned all who beg'd quarter, thereby to gain a repu∣ation of Clemency amongst his adversaries. The Brit∣ains having thus gotten York, many skirmishes happened between them and the Saxons thereabout, but Winter oming on, they gave up themselves to drinking, ban∣uetring, and other voluptuous pleasures, so that when they harcht into the Field next Summer, they were unable to ndure the labours and Fatigues of War, and for several ears performed very little Service. At length Arthur concluded a League with Loth King of icts whereby it was agreed, That Arthur during his life ould be King of Brittain, and after his discease, the King∣on should descend to Mordred the eldest son of Loth, and his eirs; That the Picts should at all times assist the Brittains against the Saxons, and should freely possess all such Lands as bey recovered from them beyond the River Humber. hat they should duly observe the League which was ma be∣tween them and the Scots; That Mordred should marry the Daughter of Gawolan a Noble Brittain; and next to Arthur
himself; That the Children of this marriage should be brought up by their Grand-father in Brittain till they came to years of dis∣cretion. That Gawan the Brother of Mordred should serve King Arthur in his Wars, for which he should receive large pos∣sessions and rewards. Arthur having concluded this League, and being desirous to purge this Island of the Heathenish Saxons, he sent to the Kings of Scotland and Pictland, re∣quiring them; That for the advancement of Christs Religion which they professed and owned they should forthwith assembl their Forces, and meet him at Tynmouth at a day appointed, that so they might join together and march against their commo Enemies the Saxons. These two Kings presently consented to this so reasonable request, and in a few days meeting with the Brittains, they presently marcht altogether against the Saxons, whom they understood were already in the Feild under Occa their General, ready to receive them Both Armies approaching each other, Colgern Duke  Northumberland rid up to the very Front of the Picts Army where he severely reproached Loth and his Nobility  their breach of Friendship with the Saxons, and told the he did not doubt but suddenly to see some just judgmen fall upon them for their Treachery and Falshood,  thus joining with their former Enemies against the most trusty Friends and constant Allies The Pictish King being mayed hereat, commande his Standards to advance, neither were the Saxons id so that the Skirmish began, which Arthur perceiving commanded the Brittans to ingage, so that there immedi∣ately followed a terrible slaughter; The Scots in th right wing killing Childrick an eminent Saxon Captain quickly discomfited them on that side, Colgern earnes∣ly desiring to be revenged of King Loth, rushed in up him with such violence that at the first encounter threw him to the ground, but instantly two Pictish Here∣men coming on one side of Colgern ran him quite throu the body, Loth soon recovered himself, but Colgern be dead, his men were so disheartned that they presen ran away; Arthur perceiving the main battel of  Saxons was now left naked, pressed n so violently up
Ocea, that having received a desperate wound,  escaped out of the battle, but being at length brought to the Sea side, he got into a Ship and escaped into Germany; This Victory being thus obtained, the Saxons were forc'd to submit themselves to King Arthur, who offered them pardon as to life and goods if they would turn Christians, and never hereafter ingage against their Neighbours the Brittains, Scots, and Picts, which if they would not con∣sent to, he commanded them that leaving their Arms and goods behind they should upon pain of death depart the Kingdom within fourteen days; Hereupon many Saxons went over to Germany, others pretending to be Christians still remained, hoping for better fortune; Several who continued after the time appointed, and refused to be baptized were put to death according to the proclamati∣on, so that very few were thought to profess he Christian Faith sincerely. All things thus quieted in Northumberland, Arthur repair∣ed several Churches in York and other places, which had been ruined and defaced by the barbarous Infidels; Next year he had notice, that the Saxons who inhabited the Isle of Wight joining with those in Kent had fallen up∣on the Brittains on that side the Thames, killing and de∣stroying a great number of them, whereat being much moved, he hasted toward Lonaon with his Forces, re∣solving utterly to root out the East and South Saxons since his Subjects could never be secure so long as that wicked generation remained amongst them. In pursuance of the League he had Twenty Thousand Picts and Scots in this expedition; Eugenius Nephew to King Congal, and Mor∣dred Son of King Loth being their General. Then marching forward he incamped in the Field near the Thames, and himself with some of his Nobility going to London caused prayers to be made to Almighty God three days together for their good success against the Saxons, on the fourth day Divine Service being celebrated by the Bishop of London, and a Sermon preached in the Market place, he committed himself and his whole Army to the tuition and protection of Jesus Christ, and then
issuing out of the City, he exhorted his Souldiers to be of good courage since they were to fight in a just quarrel against Pagans and the implacable enemies of the Christi∣an Faith. Morderd, and Gawolan his Father in Law marched in the front with five thousand Horse, and being come within five miles of the Saxons Camp, there came Am∣bassadors to King Arthur desiring him not to proceed any further, since if he pleased they were willing to depart the Land with their goods and substance with∣out further molesting the Brittains ever hereafter. But Arthur would not consent hereto, neither would so much as allow them a Truce for three days, which they ear∣nestly desired, only he told them that he would not march above two miles that day, so that if they came a∣gain next morning he would in the mean time consult with his Nobility and Captains what answer to give to their request. Whilst the Brittains were busied about the news these Ambassadors brought, the Saxons suddenly marching out of their Camp fell with much violence upon the Forces of Mordred and Gawolan, of whom they killed a great number in that surprize, though by their exhortations their men made the ut∣most resistance so small a company could against the multitude of their Enemies, by whom being at length opprest they were forced to fly, not resting till they came to the rest of the Army; Mordred and Gawolan by the help of fresh Horses made their escape without hurt though many of their followers were killed in the Fight and Chase. The Saxon Ambassadors being not yet gone out of the Camp, were hereupon secured till next morning, and then sent back with this answer; That the Brittains were resolved for the future never to treat with any Messengers free the Saxons about Peace, since it is apparent they designed nothing but treachery and falshood, having contrary to the Laws of Ar unworthily fallen upon the Brittish Ferces, whilst their Am∣bassadors pretended to make an Accommodation, that therefore they should expect nothing from Arthur but the utmost reveng
and the most cruel Severities of War in recompence of their wick∣ed infidelity. They had no sooner received this answer, but forty other of the Principal Saxons arrived, who endea∣voured to excuse what had happened over night, laying all the blame on some few rash heady fellows, who knew nothing of the proceedings of the Commanders of the Army, nor of their sending Ambassadors to them. But Arthur suspecting this to be another subtle trick of the Saxons, commanded these Messengers as well as the former to be secured in the Marshals Tent; whilst he himself in the second Watch of the night marched pri∣vately against the Enemy, dividing his Army into three parts; and having goue about three miles they fell upon the Saxons Out-guards e're they were aware, which cau∣sed such a tumult and confusion amongst them, one cal∣ling and crying out upon another, that the most valiant among them were dismayed. Mordred desirous to revenge his last overthrow, fell in fiercely among them; But some having by this time armed themselves made resist∣ance, defending themselves amidst the Carts and Carri∣ages, and thereby for a while stopt the violence of the Brittains, others unable to resist, broke out of the Camp and fled, but being pursued by the Brittish Horse a great number perisht in the next River, chusing drowning ra∣ther than to fall into the hands of their merciless Adver∣saries, who that day gave no Quarter. It was thought this Bloudy Battle, and so great a slaughter of such a multi∣tude of Saxons would have utterly disabled them that they should never after have been troublesome to the Brittains. Arthur having thus vanquished his Enemies, dismist all the Ambassadors in his Camp, upon conditi∣on they would return back to Germany, but suffered the rest of the meaner Saxons to remain still in the Land, provided they would turn Christians, and pay a yearly Tribute. The Scots and Picts who had assisted him in this War he treated with much State and Magnificence at London, giving them all possible respect and honour, and dismissing them with rich Presents and Princely re∣wards.
It is written of King Arthur, that in one Battle against the Saxons with his Sword named Callibourn he slew above eight hundred of them, if it be possible to be true. In twelve set Battles besides Skirmishes, he is said to have return'd Victor from the slaughter of the Saxons; The names of which places are said to be. The first at the mouth of the River Gleyn; The second, third, fourth, and fifth near the River Douglas in Lenox. The sixth at the River Bassus; The seventh in the Wood Calidon; The eight near the Castle of Guinien. The ninth at Car∣lion in Wales; The tenth by the Sea-side in a place called Rithwood. The eleventh upon a Hill named Agued Cather∣gain; The twelfth at Bath or Bathen Hill. Whilst these things were acted in Brittain, Conranus King of Scotland was Murthered in his Bed-chamber, by the Treason of Donald Governor of Athol, in the twenti∣eth year of his Reign and the sixteenth of Arthurs Domi∣nion over Brittain; After whom succeeded Eugenius his Nephew; About this time some Authors ascribe to Ar∣thur the obtaining of many glorious Victories against the Irish, Danes, Norwegians and other Northern Nations, yea some affirm that he subdued most part of Germany, the Low Countries, Normandy, France, the Romans, and the people of the East, the credit whereof seems very doubt∣ful. Only it is certain (as Hector Boetius affirms) that Arthur lived in the days of Justinian the Emperor, about which time the Goths, Vandals, Burgonians and French in∣vaded and ruin'd divers parts of the Roman Empire, yet we find no mention of K. Arthur acting any thing among them. But notwithstanding his wonderful Atchievements, it is related Lucius Hiberus the Roman Legate demanded of him a Tribute for Brittain, which he not only denied but also threatend to have a Tribute from Rome, as appears by his Letters sent to the Senate to this purpose. Ʋnder∣stand you of Rome that I am King Arthur of Brittain, and freely it hold and shall hold, and at Rome hastily will I be not to give you Truage, (or Tribute) but to require Truage of you, for Constantine who was Hellens Son, and other of my An∣cestors
Conquered Rome, and thereof were Emperors, and what they had I hope to recover by Gods grace; And accord∣ingly (saith the story) he set forward against Lucius Hiberius, who with great power and vain confidence came marching against him, where after a long and bloudy fight the Romans were discomfited, their General kill'd, and his slain Body sent to the Senate for a Tribute from Brittain. King Arthur to increase the Courage of his Soldiers is said to have instituted the Order of the Knights of the Round Table, to which none were admitted, but such of the Nobility as were most renowned for Virtue and Cou∣rage, they were in all the number of one hundred and fifty, the Chiefest of them being Sir Lancelot, Sr Tristram, Sir Lamrock, Sir Gawin and others. They were all record∣ed for Knights of great Renown, and had not King Ar∣thurs Valour been most transcendent each of them might have passed for no less than a Worthy. These things are related of him of which the Reader may credit as much as he please. To pass therefore these questionable mat∣ters, let us proceed to what is more certain. After the Brittains were delivered from the terror of the Saxons, and had for some time enjoyed peace and quietness, they grew Rich and Wealthy, and then be∣gan to repent of the League they had made with Loth King of the Picts, whereby it was agreed that Mordred his Son should succeed, they now resolving that no For∣reigner should Reign over them, and therefore addres∣sing themselves unanimously to King Arthur, they hum∣bly beseech him since he had no Sons to nominate a Suc∣cessor of their own Nation to govern them after his de∣cease; Arthur finding it in vain to contradict this their resolution, since they absolutely refused to be ruled by a Stranger, advised them to find out one of the Bloud-Roy∣al themselves, whom for his Wisdom, Valour, and No∣bility they were willing should Reign over them, and he for his part promised to ratifie and confirm their Electi∣on. The Nobility and Commons thereupon met together with great joy, and at length agreed upon Constantine the
Son of Cador Duke of Cornwal, a virtuous and comely young Gentleman, and induced with all Princely qualities; who being brought by the Peers of the Realm into the Council Chamber and presented to Arthur, he gladly ac∣cepted their Choice, and forthwith caused Constantine to be Proclaimed Heir Apparent to the Crown by the name of Prince of Brittain; who being thus preferr'd, behaved himself with that discretion and gallantry, that the Brit∣tains entertained a very high opinion of his worth and future Government. Mean time Loth King of the Picts deoasing, Mordred his Son succeeded him, who hearing that Constantine was proclaimed Prince, was much disturbed and sent Ambas∣sadors to Arthur to complain that contrary to the honour of a King he by proclaiming Constantine his Heir had bro∣ken the League between himself and his Father, and en∣deavoured to defeat him of his rightful Inheritance; desiring him not so easily to consent to the perswasions of the Brittains, as thereby to violate the Laws both of God and man, and admonishing him yet to observe the League which he had solemnly sworn to, and to perswade his Subjects to do the like, lest they should provoke the wrath of Almighty God against them who is a just re∣venger of the breach of all Oaths, Leagues, and Cove∣nants. To this the Nobles of Brittain answered, That the League concluded between Arthur and Loth endered but for their Lives, and was determined upon the death of either of them, and therefore Arthur had done nothing but according to the duty of a Prince who tendred the peace and happiness of his Subjects in providing one of their own Nation to succeed him, thereby to prevent the Realm from falling into the hands of strangers, which they could by no means suffer. Therefore if the Picts loved their Weal & Security, it would be good for them to be contented with their own Bounds and Dominions, since if they should attempt to gain other mens Estates and Territories they would be forced in a short time to see the mischievous Consequences of such ill advised under∣takings, The Ambassadors of Pictland returning with this An∣swer, the whole Nation were so stirr'd with indignation,
that they resolved immediately to revenge their wrongs by open War; But first they endeavoured to procure the Scots to assist them, and sending Ambassadors to Eugenius then King of Scotland, he readily agreed to their requests upon pretence that some Scotch Rebels who fled to Arthur were received by him, and likewise suffered to make In roads into Scotland. Arthur having notice of these Transactions, and War being Proclaimed against him, he first secured the Sea coasts with consde∣rable forces to prevent the Landing of the Saxons if they should attempt it. And then marched with the rest of his Army as far as the River Humber, near the Banks whereof he pitcht his Tents, (a place formerly fatal for the overthrow of the Brittains) expecting the Scots and Picts, who in a short time came up to them, and both Armies were in sight ready to ingage each other, when certain Bishops of all the three Nations riding to and fro, took great pains to perswade the Kings to Peace and Con∣cord, especially since what they were going to try with the Sword, and the loss of much Bloud and many Lives, might as well be composed by an Amicable and Friendly Agreement; Neither could they better gratifie the Sax∣ons, the common Enemies to the Christian Religion than by weakning and destroying each other to make way for them to Conquer all together. Mordred and Eugenius were induced by these carnest exhortations to refer the differences to some indifferent Persons, and presently to lay down their arms upon as∣surance that the League with King Loth should be faith∣fully observed. Arthur was also content for his part to have agreed thereto, but the other Brittains, especially the Kindred and Allies of Constantine, utterly refused it, and gave divers reproachful words to the Bishops for their unseasonable interposing, since they were already ranged in battel, so that it might be doubted they de∣signed to betray their Army to their Enemies under pre∣tence of an unprofitable agreement. After this both Parties ingaged with great fury, but the Brittains had such disad∣vantage by the place where they stood, which was full of
Mire, Bogs, and Mosses, that they could neither advan∣tagiously defend themselves nor offend their Enemies, yet the Battel continued a long time with the slaughter of so many men that the river Humbr near which it was fought grew red with bloud, and carried a multitude of dead bodies into the Sea. In the heat of the sight a subtil Scot cryed out with a loud voice in the Brittish tongue, that Arthur and most of his Nobility were slain, and it was therefore in vain to resist any longer or hope for Victory, but better for every man to shift for himself and endeavour to make his escape. This news wonderfully incouraged the Scots and Picts, but the Brittains were so much astonished at it that the greatest partinstant, fled away; Others judging it only a crafty device to discourage them continued to make the utmost resistance, till they were overpowred and almost every man slain. This Victory was veryhardly got, and cost more lives than any other for many years before, for of the Scots and Picts who won the Feild there were killed above Twenty Thousand, together with King Mordred, and abundance of the Nobility of both Nations; Of the Brittains and their confederates in the fight and pur∣suit above thirty thousand fell, and among them King Arthur himself, and Gawan brother to Mordred who had such an intire affection for his Lord and Master Arthur, that he fought couragiously on his side that day against his own brother Mordred. Gawan and most part of the Brittish Nobility were likewise slain. Next day the Camp was plundred, and among other rich spoyls Guyni∣ver King Arthurs Wife, with a great number of other Ladys and Gentlewomen were taken Prisoners, though she and some others were afterward redeemed upon ransom. This Bloudy Battel was fought in the year of our Lord 542. the 26 year of the reign of King Arthur, and so much weakned both the Picts, Scots and Brittains, that they could not recover their losses in man, years. The same year many strange Prodigies were seen. The Grass and Herbs in Yorkshire were stained with Bloud; Near Camelon a Cow brought forth a Calf with two heads;
and an Ewe brought forth a Lamb of both Sexes; The Sun for several days appeared like Bloud; The Sky was full of bright Stars at noon divers days together. In Wales there was a Battel between the Crows and Magpies on one side, and the Ravens on the other, and great slaughter was made on each side. The Body of this famous Worthy was buried at Glassen∣bury in Somersetshire in the Church yard, and discovered in the reign of King Henry the second, who being in∣formed by a Welch Ministrel that could sing many Historys in Welch of the Acts of the ancient Brittains, declared that Arthurs Body was there buried Sixteen foot deep between two Pillars lest his Enemies the Saxons should have found him, Henry caused the place to be dug up; After they had digged about seven Foot, they found a mighty broad Stone with a leaden Cross fastened to that part which lay downward, with this Inscription. Hic jacet Sepultus, inclytus Rex Arthurus in Insulae Avaloniae; Here lieth the renowned King Arthur in the Isle of Avalonia; His Body was inclosed in a great Tree made hollow, whith being opened, his Bones appeared of a very great bigness, his Shinbone reached above the knee of a very tall man, his skull was so large that the place between his eyes was a span broad, in which there appeared some signs of wounds and bruises; The Body of his wife Gynever was like∣wise buried with him, the Hair of her head was curiously plaited and shin'd like burnisht Gold, but being toucht instantly fell to dust. The Abbot who by the Kings com∣mand searched for the Grave, removed both their Bones to the great Church and there buried them in a sair dou∣ble Tomb of Marble, laying the Body of the King at the head thereof, and the Queen's at the feet, above six hundred years after they were first buried, and in the year of our Lord. 1191. I shall conclude the life of this, Worthy Prince with an Ephitaph written in me ry of him by John Leland a Monk in Latin, and translated in∣to English many years since by Nicholas Roscock which you shall have in the Poetry of those times.
Saxonicas toties qui fudit Marte cruento Turmas, & peperit spoliis sibi nomen opimis, &c. Who vanquished the Saxon Troops With Battles bloudy broils And purchas't to himself a name, With Warlike Wealthy Spoils Who with his shivering shining Sword The Picts so oft dismayed, And an unweildy servile Yoke On Necks of Scots hath laid. Who Frenchmen puft with pride, and who The Germans fierce in fight Discomfited; and beat the Danes With strong and martial might. Who of that murdering Mordred did The Vital breath expel That horrid, cruel, Monster great, That bloudy Tyrant fell. Here liveless Arthur lies intomb'd Within this stately Hearse, Famous for Strength and Chivalry And 'gainst his Enemies fierce. Whose glorious Acts and Victories Through all the World do fly, And whose most worthy Fame and Name Doth reach the very Sky.

But place upon his sacred Tomb Your Rosie Garlands gay Whose fragrant smell may witness well Your duties you display. Grass and He Near Camelon
The Hist. of Charles the Great K. of France and Emp. of Germany; The Eight Worthy of the World. portrait of Charlemagne HE well deserv'd the name of Charlemagne That to such mighty Glory did attain, Who all his Enemies having overcome, Was own'd and Crown'd Great Emperor of Rome▪ Virtue and Valour he still mixt so well, 'Twas hard to say in which he did excell. The Christian Faith he always did defend, And against Saracens did oft contend. The Huns and Pagans too he conquered, His name alone fill'd them with fear and dread, Yet all his fury he layd by, if they Would Idols leave and the True God obey;
THE Ancient French Historians relate, that the ori∣ginal Habitation of this now Potent Nation was in that part of Germany which lay nearest Gaul, now cal∣led France, and having together with the Romans obtain∣ed a great victory against the Alans, Enemies to the Em∣pire in the Reign o Valentinian they got possssion of a great part of Gaul as a fruit of their Conquest, which they held by their Sword not doing any homage for it but to their own valour. Pharamond laid the first Stone in the Building of this great Monarchy, Clodion prosecu∣ted this design; Merovee made it appear above ground, Clovis adding the profession of Christ to his own and Pre∣decessors valour, so won the Hearts of the Gauls, the Natives of this Countrey who were generally Christians, that he procured voluntary obedience from them, and an assured possession of his new Conquests, uniting both Nations into one, and giving Law to the Conquered with such wisdom and discretion, that the name of France was generally received in Gaul. The race of Pharamond con∣tinued successively in France during the Reign of one and Twenty Kings for about one hundred and twenty years; At which time nine or ten Idle Kings (as the French Hi∣story calls them) succeeding each other, the Kingdom was thereby reduced to a multitude of dangers and in∣conveniences which gave occasion to Charles Martel to lay the Foundation of a new race of Kings from his own Posterity, who being first Mayor or Governor of the Pallace, was chosen Prince of the French, and upon this account is reckoned the 22 King of France; He was a man of great wisdom and courage, and managed all Ars of War and State during the Reigns of the three last Kings. In the time of Thierry the Second, the Saracens or Turks issuing out of Asia into Africa and Spain, possest them∣selves of many mighty Kingdoms and Provinces under the command of Abderamen their King, and afterward invaded France with an Army of four hundred thousand men, but by the admirable conduct and valour of Martel, this vast multitude was utterly vanquished, three hun∣dred
seventy five thousand Barbarians being slain in the Field, and their King found dead in a heap of Carcasses not wounded but smothered by the multitude that fled, the French lost fifteen hundred, and among them many of their Nobility and Gentry; The Care and Toil of great Affairs, together with his Age having much broken Martel, and the weakness of Childerick, the last King of the first Race giving him incouragement, he resolves so to dispose of things as to leave the Kingdom to his Children, and therefore observing that Childerick loved no man nei∣ther any man him, and that Pepin Ins own Son was be∣loved of all both for his own and Martels sake, as the Pro∣tector of their Liberty, whereas Childerick did not re∣gard the common good but spent his time in folly and voluptuousness; Martel therefore at his death left France to the Government of Pepin whom he knew to be stout, and of a great Spirit. After his death the Friends of Pe∣pin proclaimed his merits in all places; but Religion, and the Reverence and Devotion the French Nation natu∣rally bear to Kings seemed to be insuperable difficulties to his advancement to the Crown; Childerick had alrea∣dy Reigned nine years, only in appearance, under Mar∣tel, and four more under Pepin, who to remove the last scruple, represented to the People, that their Allegi∣ance was vowed to true Kings and not to Kings in imagi∣nation and disguise, that they were sworn to maintain a Religious, Just, Merciful, Diligent and Active King, able to withstand their Enemies, to punish the wicked, to defend the good, and to protect the Christian Law; ac∣cording to the express words th French Kings are Sworn to in their Coronation-Oath; Why then should they think themselves bound to a vicious King who was neg∣ligent and careless of himself and his Subjects, since the Conct between them was limited, and the French were only obliged to obey him, who being endued with ma∣ny Royal Virtues, persorms the Office of a true King. These reasons were plain, and easily received by all men as absolutely necessary for the common good, though most of thera who seemed thus convinced had an Eye to
their particular advantage by the favour of Pepin. As to the scruple of Religion how they could be dispensed from their Oath of Allegiance, Pepin assuring himself of good Friends at Rome, sends thither two Bishops to Pope Za∣chary to represent to him the present State of France; who being truly informed of the weakness of Childerick, who was hated and contemned of all men, and of the general resolution of the French to receive Pepin, but chiefly moved with hopes of great Assistance from him against the Lombards his Capital Enemies; He discharg∣ed the French from their Oath of Obedience to Childerick and all his Race. Being thus freed from their Allegiance, they Assemble the General Estates, where it was concluded, That to avoyd that Confusion in the Realm which was apparently grown by the negligence of former Kings, Childerick should be rejected, and Pepin chosen; The one unworthy to reign by reason of his Vices, and the other most worthy to be K. for his Royal Virtues; But lest the Fundamental Law of Succession should be directly infringed and bro∣ken, they derive the race of Pepin from Clovis the great King of France, to whom he was acknowledged next Heir both by Succession and Virtue. The Assembly hereupon commanded Boniface Archbishop of Mentz to declare to Pepin, That in regard of his Virtues and their future hope of his worthy Goverment the French had by a free and gener al consent elected him King. And in prosecution of this Decree, Pepin was instantly Crowned by the said Archbishop, and then being raised upon a Target or Shield, he was carried about the Assembly according to an ancient Ceremony of the French; And by Virtue of the same Decree, Childerick was deposed as unworthy of the Crown, and afterward degraded, shaven, and con∣fined to a Monastery, there to pass the remainders of his days. This Pepin called the Short, the Twenty third King of France, having reigned eighteen years with much glory and the great love and affection of his Subjects (the strongest Foundation upon which a Prince can build his Authority) died in the year 768.
After his death the Estates of France being assembled, concluded to divide the Realm between his two Sons, Charles or Charlemagn the Elder, and Caroloman the Younger; Charles being Crowned at Worms, and Caroloman at Soissons; Writers have not set down the bounds of their Dominions, since three years after their Fathers death the whole Kingdom came to Charles; Brothers they were of different humors, who by equality of power endanger∣ed the ruin of the Monarchy, had not divine Provi∣dence united it in the Person of this great Prince Charles; He was indued with excellent gifts both of body and mind, of a Virtuous conversation, and above all careful∣ly educated in the Christian Religion, for which he had much reverence all his life; Charity, Temperance, Equity, and Justice in relieving his People, Fidelity to all, and Modesty in using Victorles, were the admirable effects of his knowledge, and as remarkable in him as in any Prince whatever; He naturally loved Learning and Learned men, having been instructed in the Greek and Latin Tongues, and likewise in Philosophy and the Mathe∣maticks, which Sciences he term'd his Pastimes, and the Companions of his Sword, wherewith he oft diverted himself. He took delight in Poetry, as some of his wri∣tings witness, but especially in Histories, wherein he was exceeding well read; In Arms his Father Pepin was his School-master, under whom he had great Commands which he discharg'd with such reputation that he well de∣serv'd the name of Great both for his Valour and Virtue; There appeared in his Countenance a grave sweet Ma∣jesty, in Personage he was Tall, Strong, and Patient of labour, of a clear Spirit, a sound Apprehension, Memo∣ry and Judgment, which never failed him in difficulties, terrible to some, and pleasing to others, according to the occasion; These Virtues gain'd him so much Repute that he was Beloved, Respected, and Obeyed of all men, and having received a great Kingdom from his Father, he inlarged it with wonderful success; Charles rtel, Pepin, and this Great Charles seeming to have been raised up after each other to preserve the Christian name amidst
the deluge of barbarous Nations, and the ruin of the Ro∣man Empire. Caroloman was exceeding jealous of his Brothers great∣ness, whom with grief he saw honour'd, obey'd and be∣lov'd by all the French, which caused him to endeavour as much as possible to countermine his designs, who had his eye upon Italy as the most proper Theater for his va∣lour; For after the death of Pepin the Church of Rome, fell into great confusions by the practices of Didier King of Lombardy, who having corrupted some of the Clergy caused Constantine brother to the Duke of Nepezo, (his crea∣ture and trusty friend) to be chosen Pope, and Phillipicus already elected to be violently deposed; The other party resolving not to be imposed on by Didier, by common consent chuse Stephen the Third a Sicilian to the Popedom, who resolves to call in the King of France to his assistance, upon which Charles first sends twelve Prelates to Rome to strengthen his party who unanimously confirm the Elec∣tion of Stephen, and depose Constantine raised by force and disorder; Though Didier resolved not to be con∣trolled, yet cunningly dissembling his thoughts, he sends to congratulate the Election of Stephen, and renounces Constantine, and pretending to desire the continuance of friendship, proposes to come to Rome and confer with him in private; The Pope, who only made use of the French for necessity; was easily perswaded by Didier to consent thereto, who coming makes many Protestations of Obedience; Paul Ephialte a Graecian was then Governor at Rome for the Emperor, whom Didier so corrupted that having the Execution of Justice in his hands, he causeth him to seize upon Christopher and Sergius the Popes two Secretaries in the presence of Stephen, whom accusing of supposed crimes, he infamously hanged, their greatest offence being for favouring the French; yea he proceed∣ed to banish all the Citizens of Rome who were noted to be of the French Faction, resolving to be Master of Rome in sght of the Pope; Stephen observing the falshood of the Lombards, flies again to Charlemagne for help, who resolving to assist him, Didier had so wrought with Caro∣loman
his Brother that he found means to hinder him by raising a dangerous War in Guienne. Though the County of Guienne depended on the Crown of France, yet many Rebellions happened by the practices of the Noblemen, who abusing the bounty of the French Kings that allowed them their ancient Priviledges, were ambitious to be absolute Soveraigns themselves. & to cast off their dependance upon France; Hunalt at this time was the principal Person in this Countrey, whom Caroloman finding to be very desirous of being a Duke, or Prince, resolves to imploy him against his brother Charles, Hunalt not doubting but to have credit enough with the People to make himself absolute if he were favoured by one of the Kings of France against the other; Guienne was part of Charlemagnes Territories, against whom Hunalt designs to make open War, but though the countenance of Caro∣loman might do much, yet the Wisdom and Courage of Charles prevailed more for understanding his brothers secret practices, he armed so suddenly that he seized se∣veral Great Towns and thereby all the Countrey ad∣joining submitted to him; Hunalt finding himself pre∣vented, fled to a Nobleman in that Countrey, called Loup his faithful and affectionate Friend, to whom Charles in∣stantly sends to deliver Hunalt into his hands, as guilty of High Treason; Who unable to resist, sends him back, with all his Family to whom Charles graciously grants both life and liberty, and pardons Loup, and all that obeyed him, thereby ending a dangerous War without blows. Caroloman finding his designs against his brother unsuc∣cessful, takes a Voyage to Rome under shew of Devotion, though intending other matters; His Mother Berthe ac∣companying him, was honourably received by Didier King of the Lombards, who then concluded a Marriage between her Son Charles and Theodora daughter to Didier one of the greatest enemies of his Sons good fortuno, yet Charlemagne to please his Mother Married this Wife, though he soon after put her away as disagreeable to his humour and affairs, and likewise on suspition of inconti∣nency, so that what should have been a cause of love,
bred greater hate between these two Princes; Carolom having effected nothing at Rome, only discovering his ma∣licious Jealousy, returns into France, and soon after dies in the year of our Lord 770. Charles being now alone by his brothers decease, quietly takes possession of his Domi∣nions, and then marries Hildegard daughter of the Duke of Sueve his own Subject, by whom he had three Sons and three daughters; Carolomans Jealousy died not with him, for his Wife Birthe impatient of her condition retires with her two Sons to Didier, who contrived with the Widdow to pro∣cure from Adrian then Pope a confirmation of her Sons in the Crown of France; which the Pope absolutely refused; At which time Hunalt forgetful of the mercy of Charles comes to Didier by whom he is received and made Gene∣ral of the Army against the Pope for denying the King of Lombardy's request, who having no other weapons but Ex∣communication, implores the aid of Charles, who first sends Ambassadors to Didier requiring him to restore what he had taken from the Pope, and to suffer him to live in peace; Who insisting upon having the Children of Caro∣loman declared Kings of France; His demands were thought so unreasonable that the Treaty is broke off, and Charles instantly prepares for War, and in a short time gives the Lombards two notable defeats; And at length besieges him and all his Forces, in Pavia, which was soon surrendred, and Didier falls into his hands who was sent Prisoner to Lyons, and the Kingdom of the Lombards thereby utterly ruined; During the Siege of Pavia a Council was held at Rome by Pope Adrian in favour of Charlemagne, and for his merits toward the Church the right to bestow all Benefices in Christendom was said to belong to him. Charlemagne being returned into France, Aldegise the Son of Didier endeavoured to disquiet Italy by the aid of the Emperor Constantine, and the practices of Rogand to om Charlemagne had given Friuli, but all these Re∣bellions were soon supprest by the diligence of the French Goverors, and Rogand being taken, was beheaded by
he Kings Command. But the end of this War was the eginning of another in Germany, whereof the Saxons were the Chief Authors with the assistance of some of their Neighbours, this War continued thirty three years at divers times; The Saxons in Germany were at this time Subject to the Crown of France under Martel and Pepin his Son, and the desire of recovering their ancient liberty, but especially of retaining their Pagan Superstition re∣ceived from their Ancestors, was the chief occasion of these tedious Troubles; For Charles zealous for the Christian Faith, endeavoured to oblige them to make profession thereof; Upon this Controversy of Religion the Saxons made War eight times against him, especially when they found him busied elsewhere, and took Stras∣burg, and several other Towns then in possession of the French; whereupon Charles calling a Parliament at Worms, leavied a great Army, wherewith having vanquished the Saxons twice in one Month in the open Field; he redu∣ced them to their ancient Obedience, yet used his Victo∣ty with much Modesty and Wildom, designing rather to show his Power than his Justice. The Chief Comman∣der among them was one Widichind, who being by Charles perswaded without any violence to imbrace the Christian Religion, by his means the greatest part of the Saxons were brought to the knowledge of the true God, and into Obedience to the French Monarchy. After this, the Zeal for Religion gave some colour of necessity to the Heroical desire of Charlemagne to inlarge his Dominions by making War upon the Saracens, or Moors in Spain, who had then conquered a great part thereof, which they divided into distinct Kingdoms; yet all these petty Kings resolved to unite against Charles their common Enemy, and to prevent all his designs, they caused one of their Kings called Idbunala to insinu∣ate into his Friendship, and Charlemagne pushed on both by him and Alphonso (sirnamed the Chast) King of Navar, and well affected thereto himself, he brings his Forces into Spain, and took the Cities of Pampelona and Saragosa, plundering them and putting all the Saracens to the
Sword. Encouraged by this success, he marches on re∣lying on his usual Fortune, many small Towns in the way terrified by their example, yielding upon composi∣tion; and then giving part of his Army to be command∣ed by Milon his Brother in Law, it happened that near Bayonne, Aigoland a Saracen King took him at such advan∣tage that he defeated him with the loss of forty thousand men, Milon himself being slain. Aigoland elevated with this Victory, and Charles being far off, he marches into Gas∣coign and besieges Agen, to draw him home for the de∣fence of his own Countrey; who doubting the Fidelity of the Gascoins, makes a speedy return, but so tired that his Troops were altogether unserviceable; which Aige∣land being sensible of, sends him a Proposal, That to pre∣vent bloudhed, and the unnecessary destruction of Mankind, and since he understood that Charles would make Peace with them if they would imbrace the Christian Religion, he desired the Tryal of the true Faith might be made only by some few Troops protesting to yield to that Religin which should overcome in the Combat; The condition was accepted by Charles, and the Christian Troop vanquished the Saracens; Aigo∣land hereupon declares himself openly a Christian, but intended nothing less, and takes this occasion to break the Treaty; He finds Charles at his Table eating with the Chief of his Followers, (for Kings used not then to eat alone) and sees twelve poor men in very ragged Cloths near the Noblemens Table, and demanding who those miserable Creatures were that fed by themselves, was told, They were the Messengers of God, who replied, Sure your God is very poor himself, since his Messengers are so very mean and contemptible; and thereupon takes occasion to re∣tire. Charlemagne resolving to be revenged for this bold af∣front of the Saraeen, raises an Army of an hundred and thirty thousand men, wherewith he defeated Aigolands Forces at Pampelona, and carried away the head of this prophane King as a Tropby of his Victory; and after∣ward utterly defeated the remainder of his Forces; The Saracens again Mustering a new Army, Rowland Nephew
to Charles marches against them with only twenty thou∣sand men, and being suddenly set upon in his passage o∣ver the Pyrenean Mountains, he is over powerd with numbers, and retiring himself apart for some refresh∣ment, he there perishes for thirst, by reason of the long and painful Combat he had indured; yet not without revenge, for he killed Marseilles one of their Kings with his own hand. Charlemagne advertised of this unexpected loss, returns suddenly and takes revenge on the Saracens, killing a vast number of them, and building Tombs for Rowland and those other valiant Commanders who died in the Bed of Honour; and his other urgent Affairs in France requiring his presence he returned thither; That the War in Spain ended with little success, having dis∣turbed Charles at divers times for fourteen years past. At his return from Spain, Charlemagne finds occasion to exercise his Valour first in Italy where Alde ise the Son of Didier again attempted to settle himself, but was soon suppressed with much loss to the Lombard Rebels. The like occasion bred a War in Germany; For King Ta∣silon Son in Law to Didier, by his Wives perswasions en∣deavours to shake off the Yoke and flies to Arms, ingag∣ing the Huns, and other Nations against Charlemagne who suppressed them with such happy success that Tasilon be∣ing Vanquished, and found guilty of Treason and Rebel∣lion, was according to the Salique Law, condemned to lose his Estate whereby the Kingdom of Bavaria ended, and was incorporated into the Crown of France. The Huns (from whom the Hungarians are derived) together with the Danes, Westphalians and divers other Nations who were united in this War against Charles, were all brought under his Obedience, their Countreys containing Hungary, Valachia, Bohemia, Transilvania. Denmark and Poland; Thus the French Mnarchy grew great by the happy Valour of rlemagne; France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Hungary made the Romon Empire in the West, and Charles being Master of these godly Provinces, was in effect Emperor thereof, and wanted only the Title, which he obtained by this means.
Leo being then Pope of Rome, a strange sedition was raised against him by Silvester and Gampul men of great credit in the Court of Rome, who in a Solemn procession seize upon the Pope before St. Laurence Church, they stript him of his Pontificial robes, throw him to the ground, tread him under their feet, bruise his face with their fists, and having drawn him ignominiously through the dirt, they throw him into Prison; But he continued not long there being freed by a Groom of his Chamber, and recovering St. Peters Church, he intreats Vingise Duke of Spoleto to free him from this miferable Captivity, who presently marching to Rome, carried him thence to Spoleto; From whence he goes with all speed to France to Charles whom he found ingaged in many troubles, who yet neglected all other affairs to assist Leo in this his great necessity; And marching to Rome with a potent Army, he speedily pacifies all disturbances, and punishes the Popes Enemies according to Law; Leo being thus put into possession of his Soveraignty, declares Charles to be Em∣peror of the West, which with the price of his bloud lost in opposing the furious incursions of barbarous Nations he had valiantly gotten possession of, and accordingly Crowns him Emperor with the full consent of the Roman People who asisted at his Coronation, crying with one general voice, All happiness, long life and Victory to Charles Augustus Crowned the Great and Peaceable Emperor of the Ro∣mans, always happy and victorions; This was performed in the year of our Lord 800. Italy having for thirty years past suffered horrible Confusions without Emperor, without Laws and without order. The Seat of the Roman Empire since Constantine the Great remained at Constantinople a City of Thrace, conve∣nient for the guard of the Eastern Provinces; All the West being full of strangers, who having expelled the Roman Name and Authority, the force of the Empire remained in the East, where the State was in a strange confusion by fatal differences; Constantine Son to Leo the Fourth was then Emperor, who (together with the Empire) was governed from his infancy by Irene his Mother; At this
time there was great division in the East about Images, which had already continued eighty years, the  ops would needs bring them into the Christian Church, but were always opposed by Constantines Predecessors; but the Empress having assembled a Council at Nice it was there decreed by her consent and earnest desire, That mages should be planted in Christian Churches for De∣votion; Charlemagne did not approve of this decree, but writ, or caused to be written a small Treatise against this Council, to be seen at this day, and called, A Treatise of Charlemagn's, touching Images against the Greek Synod. The present Emperor Constantine retained the heredi∣tary hatred of his Father and Grand-Father against them, so that being now of age, and in possession of the Em∣pire he disanulled all those new decrees, and caused images in all places to be beaten down, yet he still shew∣ed respect to his Mother, allowing her great part of her former Authority, which occasioned an horrible Tra∣gedy to follow, for being inraged both for his crossing her new opinion about Images, and for the loss of part of her power, She resolves to disposless him of the Em∣ress, and having corrupted the Chief Officers with her Sons Money, she seized on him, put out his eyes, sent im into banishment. where he soon after died for greif, and took possession of the Empire for her self. These unnatural Tragedies were acted in the East while Charlemagne by his great Valour erected an Em∣ire in the West; After Constantines death, Irene sent to Charles to excuse her self, disowning the Murther, and charging it on some who had done it without her com∣mand; and likewise treated with him about Marrying er, his Empress being lately dead, premising to con∣sent he should be declared Emperor of the East, and that he would resign up all her power to him, but Charle∣magne would not accept thereof; the Nobility and Peo∣ple after this, had such a publick derestation of her, the Murtheress of her own Child, that having sufered er three years, Nicephorus a Noblemant of Greece, affed y the Chief of the Cou, and with the consent of the
people makes himself Emperor, and only Banishes Irent He afterwards Treats and Compounds with Charles, tha the Empire of the East continuing under his Command that of the West should remain to Charlemagne, which being confirm'd by the general assent of the Greeks, th Empire was divided into the East and West; That of th West began with Charlemagne, and remain'd in his Fami∣ly while they continued Virtuous, and was afterward re∣moved to the Princes of Germany, who acknowledg the German Original of Charlemagne, he being born a Worms, Crowned at Spire, and buried at Aix, all Citie of Germany. Charles lived fifteen years after he had united the R man Empire to the French Monarchy; Grimald Duke  Benevent after endeavoured to disturb Italy for the Lom∣bards, but was timely prevented; and about the same time the War in Saxony was renewed, being always pro to Rebellion, and likewise that against the Huns, Bohe ans, Sclavonians and Saracens; As likewise a dangerou War against the Venetians, by whom the Emperor and hi Frenchmen received a severe check, and had reason to glo∣ry that among all the People of Italy subdued by Charle magne, they remained unvanquished, and were able  oppose themselves against him. At length all things bein quieted, and Char'es finding himself old and broken wit cares, and that his three Sons were Wise, Valiant, an Obedient, he resolved to divide his Empire among them; To Pepin he gave Italy; to Charles, Germany at the Neighbour Counereys, keeping Lewis his Eldest So at home to Inherit the Kingdom of France; But in a sho time after, his two Sons Charles and Pepin the best sup∣ports of the Empire and true Inheritors of their Fathe Valor, both died, leaving Lewis their Brother with large Territories, and mean Virtues, to succeed in so great a Estate Charlemage secming hereby deprived of  Arms, his Enemies the Saranens in Spain, and the  on as and  in the Nrth rose in Rebellion ag him, ut as old and broken as he was, he vanquisht the all and reduced them again to Obience. And his A
fairs being thereby again setled, his mind now won out with the toils and difficulties of his whole Life, red nothing but rest, and being well instructed in Religion, and knowing how necessary it was that those who taught others should be well qualified themselves both in Do∣ctrine and Manners, he called five Councils for Reform∣ing and Governing the Church, and likewise a great Coun∣il at Frankford of the Bishops of France, Germany, and I∣aly, which he himself honoured with his presence, where by general consent, The false Synod of the Greeks, untruly alled the Seventh, was condemed and rejected by all the Bishops who subscribed to the condemnation. After this a new accident called Charles again to arms, Alphonso King of Navar, (Sirnamed the Chast for his singular tem∣perance) sends to him, that now there was opportunity utterly to root the Saracens out of Spain, Charles extream∣y desirous to finish this work, raises an Army and mar∣ches thither, but though Alphonso meant sincerely, the Chief of his Court (who feared the Forces of Charles no ess than the Saracens, doubting to be deprived of their Governments by a new Master) created so many diffi∣culties and dangers, that he was obliged to return into France without acting any thing considerable, and so con∣cluded all his Enterprizes, imbracing the care of Reli∣gion as a Subject only fit for the remaider of his ys; He was Sixty eight years old when he left the Ws and spent three whole years in his Closet, reading the Bible, and the Books of St. Augustine whom he admired above all the Doctors of the Church; He resided at Paris to have frequent conference with the Learned, where he e∣rected a famous University, supplyed with learned men, and inriched with great Priviledges. Thus Charlemagne spent three years happily, only in the care of his Soul, leaving an excellent example to Princes to moderate their greatness with plety, and in the full enjoyment of Temporal things not to forget e∣ternal, nor their departure out of this life; Then sorecl∣ling the time of his Death, he made his Will, leaving Lewis his Son sole Heir of his mighty Deminions, and
causing him to be Crowned by the General consent of th Estates, where himself being present, after having mad a long and fervent prayer prostrate before God, with hi dear Lewis, he put the Crown upon his head, and said thus to him. My Dear Son, it is to day that I die to the Empires of th World, and that Heaven seems to make me be born again in you Person; If you will Reign happily, fear God, who is the founda∣tion of Empires, and the Soveraign Father of all Dominions; Keep his commandments, and cause them to be observed with in violable fidelity; Take the care and protection of Religion an Gods Church into your hands; Love your Sisters, render you self good and officious to your kindred; Honour Gods Ministers cherish tenderly your Subjects as your Children, and be contin ally the Comforter and Protector of the Poor. Chastice the vici∣ous, and recompence men of merit; Establish Governors Judge and Officers that are capable and without reproach, and whe you have chosen them, do not deprive them of their charges with out very just cause. Serve first of all for an Example to a the World, and lead before God and man an irreproveable life. After this Action, he survived about a year longer im∣ploy'd in all kind of Religious Exercises and then fallin sick, continued so only eight days and died in the 71 yea of his age, and the 47 of his Reign including the 15 year of his Empire, and in the year of our Lord 814; H Corps was exposed in publick, cloathed like a King wit a Sword, and the Gospel lying by him, which he had ∣glor ously defended; He was buried with a Stately mag nitiance in the Church of Aix in a Chappel himself he butle. He was one of the greatest Princes of the Age His Virtue may be a pattern for Princes, and his Fortur the Subject of their withes. The greatness of his Mon ∣chy is admirable, for he quictly enjoy'd all Fran, ∣many most part of Hungary, all Italy and part of Spai Yet his Virtues were greater thn his Empire, his  mency, wisdom, courage, Learning (even in the Hol Serres) his , Magnanimity and singular   Paise.

The Ninth Worthy of the World. portrait of Godfrey, King of Jerusalem GOdfrey a Worthies Name doth well deserve Whom for his Valour, All might wish to serve, He for recevery of the Holy Land The Turks and Infidels did oft withstand, Whereby at length he won Jerusalem, That had a long time been enslav'd by them, In which he so much Courage made appear, The Christian Princes with one voice declare That he alone shall be Jerusalems King, And th' richest Spoils they freely to him bring, Which Honour, all Men since him justly give. And'mong the Great his Fame shall ever live.
the Princes of that fair Dutchy of Lorrain. Godfrey of Bossu having no Children, made him his Heir, and gave him the Earldom of Bullen which occasioned him to have that Strname who by his Heroick Actions hath rendred him∣self one of the Worthies of the World; He was naturally inclined to all sorts of Virtue, much whereof was owing to his happy education under the exact care of a wise Fa∣ther and a Mother of extraordinary merit, who with a diligence unusual to her Sex had her self studyed, and therefore infused into him all sort of curious Learning; and is said to have predicted the future greatness of her three Sons, for one day as the Earl her husband deman∣ded of her what she had hid in her lap, being playing with the Children, she very seriously answered, that she had there three Great Princes, one Duke, one King, and one Earl, which was afterwards verified in the ad∣mirable Fortunes of these three Princes, for Godfrey was Duke of Lorrain and King of Jerusalem; Baldwin was King of the same Realm, after Godfrey, and Prince of Edessa, and Eustace whom some say was the elder Brother, was Earl of Bullen after the death of his Father; It is likewise related that she had a strange dream before the Birth of Prince Godfrey, for the Sun seemed to descend from the sky and fall into her lap, and she saw her little Son sit∣ting on a Throne in the midst thereof; But this is cer∣tain that she used to relate with much pleasure after the Glorious success her Sons had in the Holy-War, that long before there was any discourse thereof, Prince Godfrey used to say, That he would one day take a Voyage to Jerusalem not for Devotion only as a Pilgrim, but as a Captain and Con∣queror at the head of an Army to chase the wicked Infidels from that Holy place. After his Uncles death the Emperor Henry the Fourth pretending that the Dutchy of the lower Lorrain for want of Heirs Male devolved to him conferred it on his Son Conrade, leaving Godsrey nothing there but the Marquisate of Antwerp, and on the other side Albert Earl of Namur his kinsman and the Bishop of Verdun endeavoured to de∣prive him of Bullen and Verdun; So that before he was se∣venteen
years of age he was compelled to an early Valour for recovering his Right; which he did by vanquishing their joint Porces, and conquering Earl Albert in a single combat; And then he assisted the Emperor Henry in his Wars in Italy and Germany, though he had injuriously dealt with him who was at length so much overcome by his extraordinary merit and the considerable services he had performed, that he again put him into possession of Lorrain, his Mothers inheritance, which he had detained from him thirteen years; and likewise gave him his fister Adelaida in marraige; Godfreys aflairs being in so good a Posture, the Voyage for the Holy Land was proclaimed, which he imbraced with such earnestness and generosity that he sold almost all his Estate to the Bishops of Leige and Verdun to raise Forces, so that by an odd adventure the Princes improve∣rished themselvess to serve Jesus Christ, and the Priests inriched themselves with the spoils of these Temporal Princes, chusing rather to make use of that money (which like them they should have imployed in this Holy Expe∣dition) to advance their present fortunes which they saw these Princes so generously part with for the Love of God; Godfrey being hereby provided to raise Souldiers, his fame and repuration soon furnished him with military men from all parts, many Princes and Gentlemen, also his Friends serving under him as Volunteers; He was now a∣bout thirty five years old, and so excellently qualified both in Person and mind for a Captain and a Souldier, that he obtained an absolute Empire over those Spirits who voluntarily submitted to his conduct. But Peter the Hermite addressing himself to him, Godfrey perceiving he should be clogged with a multitude of unprofitable people who followed that Priest, and were more like to cause a Famine than give any real assistance, he ordered that they should march under their own Leader, and Peter being a Gentleman, who before his turning Hermit, had born arms, the desire of glory induced him to believe that he might lawfully undertake such a military command with∣out affronting the order of Priesthoed, or imbracing
the World which he had renounced, but he soon found by woful experience what it was to exceed the Bounds of his Profession, for his Soldiers in their march living upon free Quarter, were most of them knockt on the head by the Inhabitants before they got to Constantinople. In August 1096. Godfrey with an Army of ten thou∣sand Horse, and seventy thousand Foot well appointed, and attended with many Princes and Nobles of the first Quality, marched into Germany, and passing over the vast Countries of Bulgaia, he at length arrived at Philipolis in Thracia, where some differences with Alexis the Greek Emperor being composed, he at length came to Constan∣tinople, whither the rest of the Christian Princes and their Forces following soon after, it was resolved first to Be∣siege Nice the Capital City of Bythinia, and Duke God∣frey advancing before as far as Nicomedia, and having le∣velled the ways over the Mountains from that Town to Nice, they invested that place. May 16. Godfrey with his Brother Baldwin took the Right hand over against the Principal Gate of the City where it was most strongly Fortified. May 24. A general Assault was given upon several Quarters at once, and the Combat was continued all day till night parted them, and the next morning again renewed with extraordinary fury though without effect, the Besieged being not only gallant men, but in hourly expctation of relief from Soliman the Turkish Emperor, to whom they had dispatcht an Express to inform him of their condition, and the Sultans Letters in Answer to them whereby he assured them of certain relief the next morning, being intercepted by the Christians they accordingly made Provision to receive him; The Turks early in the morning descended from the Mountains, and dividing into two great Bodies, one of them assaulted Godfreys Quarter which lay next to that of Reymond Earl of Flanders, but were received by both these Princes with so much vigor, that they were presently put into disorder, and forced to a hasty flight; yet the Besieged continued to make an obstinate defence, among whom there was one Valiant Turk, who for his great Bulk and
extraordinary Strength seem'd a Giant, that defended one of the Towers which were assaulted by Count Ray∣mond; he had been often repulsed but still renewed the Attack making terrible havock among the Christians, and intollerably insulting over those who fell under his Arms, and exposing himself naked to a vast number of Arrows that were shot at him, he with both his hands fell to throwing down Stones of a prodigious bigness up∣on those who attempted to undermine the Wall, though he had above twenty Arrows sticking in his Breast, and looked as if he were bristled with them; Godfrey coming from his own Quarter, and unable to endure this inso∣lence of a Barbarian, with a well placed Arrow shot him through the very Heart, and tumbled him dead into the Ditch; Thus the bravest man of the Turks seem'd to stay to receive an honourable death from the hand of the gallantest of the Christians; Soon after Solyman having made another fruitless attempt to relieve them, the Be∣sieged delivered up the City by Treaty to the Christians. The Princes, not to lose the season of the year, march∣ed immediately from thence toward Syria and for con∣venience of Forrage they separated into two Bodies, that part under the Earl of Flanders and the Duke Nor∣mandy taking the left, and Godfrey the right hand, but yet without distancing the Armies above two miles asun∣der; The Duke of Normandy had not marched far, when they had notice that Solyman with three hundred and sixty thousand Turks and Persians, all Horse, with an infi∣nite number of Arabians intended to surprize and sur∣round the Christians the next morning; Who instantly sent to advertise Duke Godfrey of their danger, who again joining the Army the Princes incouraged their Souldiers telling them, That they were the same Enemies they had oft before vanquished at Nice, and that in sighting valiantly against those wicked Insidels, if they died they might be certain of eternal happiness; And then drawing their Swords they cryed out, It is the will of God, which words the whole Army repeated with such a terrible Harmony, the Vallies, Rocks, and Mountains shook with the dreadful Eccho; and
thereupon, presently engaging, by the Conduct of God∣frey and Reymond who ran full speed upon the Turks with their European Lances, which they had neither Shields nor Breast-plates to oppose, they were overthrown horse and man, and the Arabs not enduring a charge hand to hand, fearing to be surrounded, began to betake them∣selves to slight, which caused such fear and disorder in the whole Army, that it put them in a moment to general rout, and the Christians obtained a compleat Victory, with a Prodigious quantity of booty and plunder which they found in the Turkish Camp, and then marching for∣ward toward Syria they arrived about Antioch in Pisidia which surrendred to them without ressistance as did most of the other Cities in their passage. Whilst the Army refresht themselves in Pisidia after such Toyls and hardships, Prince Godfrey had like to have been lost by a strange accident, which however redound∣ed in conclusion much to the honour of this Prince, ad∣vancing his Reputation, Courage and Nobleness which ap∣peared even to admiration upon this dangerous occasi∣on; For one day entring alone on Horseback into a Wood, he heard the voice of a man who cryed out for help with all his power, and advancing to the place from whence the noise came, he perceived it was a poor Souldier, who coming to cut Wood was running almost quite cut of breath round a great Tree to save himself from the mer∣ciless Jaws of a monstrous and furious Bear which was just ready to seize upon him; Godfrey transported with Courage and Charity spurred on his Horse with his sword in his hand toward the cruel Beast, who forsaking the Souldier, with inflamed eyes, gaping Jaws, and the terri∣ble Claws of her two fore Paws, advanced toward him, and raising her self upon her hinder feet to throw her self upon the Horse, she was affrighted with the Sword, and to avoyd the blow fell sideling, but so that Horse and man fell over her, and she catch hold of the Dukes Coat to draw him toward her, but Godfrey nimbly reco∣vering his fall, and seizing on her left paw which she thrust out to lay hold of him, he ran his Sword up to the
hilt in the belly of this monstrous enemy, when one of his Gentlemen coming in at the noise dispatcht the Beast already overthrown with the terrible blow she had re∣ceived; But Godfrey in drawing his Sword from between his legs after his fall, having given himself a cruel wound in his Thigh, which during the heat of the combate he did not perceive, he had lost so much bloud, that after he began to cool, he suddenly sunk down in a Swoon; This accident though it proved not dangerous, spread a migh∣ty Consternation through the whole Army as if all had been lost, so much confidence and authority they placed in his Valor and Judgment, especially since the last bat∣tle where he gained the Christians a glorious Victory out of the hands of the Insidels, who were just ready to ruine them. The Christians having conquered Cilicia and great part of Armenia, they next besieged the City of Antioch, and having lain some time before it, two Fleets from Genoa, and Pisa arrived very fortunately at the Port of St. Simeon with all sorts of Provisions, which were very wel∣com after a five months Seige, the news whereof no sooner arrived at the Camp, but the Souldiers ran thither in Shoals to furnish themselves with what they wanted. The Turks who continually watched for all advantages laid an Ambuscade of four thousand men that secretly sal∣lied out of the Town, who meeting with the Souldiers in their return without Order or Arms, but only their Swords and loaden with Provisions, they fell upon them, and obliged them to fly to the Mountains leaving all their Provisions, and a thousand of their Companions dead upon the place. Godfrey soon advertized of this disaster, took a strong Party resolving immediately to charge the Tarks whom he doubted not to find in sufficient disorder upon Joy of their Victory; The Governor of Antich having from one of the Towers of his Castle observed this motion of the Christians, was in much pain for the safe return of his men, and therefore commanded the greatest part of his Army to sally out of the City for their relief; Godfrey
marched on slowly, having notice that the Conquerors, having joined the Troops of the Town, drew near loa∣den with their booty, then drawing his Sword and turn∣ing to his men, after he had lookt fiercely toward the Enemy, he cryed, Follow me it is the will of God Ordering them only to use their Swords without either Lances or Arrows, so that with their Swords drawn and their Buck∣lers they made a kind of Penthouse against the Arrows of the Turks, who being thereby put out of their usual way of fighting, the Service of their Bows being taken from them, they presently recoiled upon their assistants, and being incumbred with Spoils, the Christians fell in∣to the midst of them, and on all hands made a most hor∣rible slaughter of these miserable wretches, so that they were totally routed, some flying to the mountains, others toward the City, not dreaming that the Gate was shut against them; Godfrey to prevent their return into the Town, flew like lightning among his enemies, there was no blow of his terrible Sword which drew not a dreadful death with it, so that he filled all with Horror, Lloud and Terror, which way soever he turned himself, and the other Princes finding the Enemies stopt by God∣freys Squadron, made a most woful destruction among them, and their lamentable cries at length obliged the Governor to open the Gates, and receive the small re∣mainder into Antioch. One of the Principal Turks of a Stature much exceed∣ing others, transported with fury to observe that Godfrey killed all who came within the reach of his terrible Sword, he ran up to him foaming with rage, and with his broad-Sword discharged so terrible a blow on the Duke that he split his Shield in two pieces which he had opposed to secure his head; when Godfrey raising himself upon his Stirrups, gave him such a furious stroke, that his Sword falling on his right Shoulder passed quite through his Breast to his left side, and made that half of his body tumble to the ground, while the other remaining in the Saddle was carried by the Horse quite through the Town, making such a fearful spectacle as struck Consternation
and Horror in all the beholders; Night coming on the Defendants throwing whole showers of Arrows from the Walls, hindred the further pursuit of the Victory; The Christians lost above a thousand men, but it is almost impossible to count the loss of the Turks, which was so great that they partly stopped the River with their dead Bodies. After this great Victory the Besieged were more close∣ly blocked up, and some time after Antioch was surpri∣zed by Stratagem by the Christian Princes; which was followed by another great Victory wherein the Enemy lost an hundred thousand Horse, and an incredible num∣ber of Foot. And then the Princes assembled to consult concerning the principal Enterprize, which was that of Jerusalem, during which Godfrey, or Geoffry de la Tour, go∣ing out upon a party as he frequently did, he heard the terrible roaring of a Lion, who seemed rather to cry out for some dreadful mishap befallen him, than in sol∣lowing the Prey to devour it, and without a moments deliberation he broke away from those that would have held him, toward the next Wood, and ran directly to the noise, where he saw a horrible Serpent of prodigious magnitude, who having wound himself about the Legs of a Lion, had prevented him from defending himself, and darted many blows at him with his Tongue to kill him with his Poyson; who thereupon struck the Serpent such a blow with his Sword, that he killed him without hurting the Lion, and after that cut the wreaths of the Serpent wherewith he was intangled; when the poor Lion saw himself at liberty, he came in the most expres∣sive manner, and with the greatest submission to render thanks to his deliverer, couching down and licking his Feet, and afterward would never forsake him, but sol∣lowed him like a faithful Dog without offending any but his Enemies, upon whom by a sign given he would be sure to fall, and was always with him in the Combat and Chase, and never failed to provide Venison for his Mas∣ter; a marvellous instance of natural gratitude, and a re∣proach to Mankind, who oft prove ingrateful to their
Benefactors though indued with all the force of reason. The Christians now marching with all speed toward Jerusalem, took Rama in their way and then marching to Emaus about two Leagues and an half from Jerusalem, they from thence had a fair prospect of the lofty Towers of the Holy City which filled the hearts of the Princes, Officers, Souldiers, and the whole Troop of Pilgrims with great Joy, and then coming up to it, that they might avoyd a tedious seige, like that of Antioch, it was resolved to at∣tack the place by main force, though those within were more numerous than the Christian Army who were not above Twenty Thousand Foot and fifteen Hundred Horse, the rest of that vast number of three Hundred Thousand men who came into Asia, being either dead with disea∣ses, or slain in the several encounters, the Christians therefore coming up close to the Walls, raised up their scaling Ladders and mounted to the top from whence with mad courage they threw themselves into the Town, where they desperately fought hand to hand with the Sa∣racens, who were amazed at this more than heroick bold∣ness, and no doubt if they had had more Ladders Jerusa∣lem had been that day taken, but since one Ladder could mount a very few men, a Retreat was sounded after hav∣ing lost a great many brave Souldiers in that rash attempt, who yet sold their Lives so dear, that twice as many of the Saracens fell with them. Duke Godfrey concerned at this miscarriage, resolved for the future to assault the Town with proper Engines of War, which he managed with such extraordinary success, that making a great breach in the Walls, he threw him∣self into the Town with such admirable courage, that the other Princes following him, they in short time all entred and took full possession, putting all the Insidels to the Sword, and killing the very Children in the Arms of their Mothers thereby if it were possible to extinguish the whole race of Turks. In short a most terrible ven∣geance was taken upon them, and the Houses being plun∣dred the whole Army found themselves inriched beyond imagination; The richest Booty was found in the Temple
of Solomon, from whence was taken an inestimable Trea∣sure of Gold, Silver and Jewels, which the Princes ge∣nerously presented Duke Godfrey as the Person to whose only courage and conduct it was due; Eight days after this happy conquest the Princes and Lords assembled to re-establish the ancient Government of Jerusalem by giving it a King; Divers were proposed, and it was offered to Robert Duke of Normandy Son to William the Conqueror, but he designing to return home as soon as possible, declined it, telling the Assembly, That it was most evident they ought to chuse that Person whose Piety, Modesty, Frudence Justice, Valour and Success had appeared in many occasions; That Person whose strength of Age, Body, No∣bility, Greatness and Majesty, worthy of an Empire, conspired to rank him among the greatest Princes that ever were, and My Lords (sayd he) all these extraordinary qualities render them∣selves so conspicuous in the Person who possesses them, that it may seem unnecessary to name him, and God himself seems to have nominated him in giving him these surpassing advantages above the rest of mankind, whom he hath chosen like a second David to be King of Jerusalem, It is the Illustrious Godfrey of Bul∣len Duke of Lorrain, whom the Prince had no sooner named but the whole Assembly interrupted him, crying out with the same mind and voice, Godfrey, Godfrey, long live Godfrey the most puissant and pious King of Jerusa∣lem; And notwithstanding all the resistance of that mo∣dest Prince, he was obliged to consent to the Election which seemed confirmed to him by Divine approbation; And the very same day he was conducted to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and there proclaimed King amidst the acclamations of the whole Army, and all the Chris∣tians of the Countrey who came flocking in to inhabit the City of Jerusalem; He was there presented with a Royal Crown richly adorned with Pearls and precious Stones which he absolutely refused with this Zealous answer. Why should I bear the name of a King in a place where my Saviour hath been crowned with reproaches? should I take the Scepter in my hand, where he hath taken the Cross upon his Shoul∣diers? Should I suffer a Crown of Gold upon my head where he
hath received a Crown of Thornes? Sure I should then hold my self for vanquished if such a vanity should be victorious over my heart. It is God that hath inspired us with these designs; It is he that hath conducted and crowned us with success, I pretend therefore to no other honours, than to lay all honours at the seet of the Cross of Christ. But though he would not take upon him∣self the name of King, yet it was constantly given him, as all Historians of that time and Posterity have ever since done to this very day, and certainly never any King bet∣ter deserved to wear that glorious Title which he adorn∣ed with so many Royal Actions. The Sultan of Egypt coming too late to relieve Jerusa∣lem, advanced now with a formidable Army to besiege it, against whom Godfrey and his Souldiers marched with much courage and resolution, over whom they obtained an intire Victory, with richer pillage than any time be∣fore in the whole War, the Enemy losing thirty thousand upon the place and as many more in the pursuit. After this Battle the Princes and great Lords who followed them believing they had fully accomplished their vow of recovering the Holy Land, took their leaves of King Godfrey to return to their respective Countries, leaving him only three hundred Horse and about two thousand Foot, with which few Troops the King to inlarge the Frontiers of his new Kingdom, conquered the places which were yet untaken round about Jerusalem; And now after so many Toils being fallen sick he caused him∣self to be removed to the City, where July 8. 1100. In the fortieth year of his age, and the first of his Reign he rendred his glorious Soul into the hands of his Almighty Redeemer by a most Religious death, (his brother Bald∣win succeeding K. of Jerusalem in his stead) He was a Prince in whom all Virtues, Christian, Civil and Military met in the highest point of humane perfection without mixture of any default, so that it will remain difficult to find ano∣ther like him to whom without Flattery the same praises may be given, and which induced future Ages to bestow on him the honourable Title of one of the Worthies of the World.
