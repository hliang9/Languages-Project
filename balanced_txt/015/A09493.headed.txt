A BRIEFE RELATION of the late Martyrdome of fiue PERSIANS Conuerted to the Catholique Faith by the refor∣med Carmelites, who remaine in the Mission of PERSIA, with the King of Persia, in his Citty of Haspahan. And of the increase of the Christi∣an Faith in those parts. Gathered out of the Letters, which the Fathers labouring in the said Mission, haue written vnto their Gene∣rall: which Letters are printed in the Italian and French, and are now translated into English for the good of the Church. Teach yee all Nations, Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Math. 28. 19. DOWAY Printed with permission of Superiours. 1623.
IN my former Letters I made re∣lation to your Reuerence, not onely of the state of this our Mis∣sion into Persia, and the bordering Kingdomes, where by the goodnesse of Almighty God, wee haue labou∣rers who diligently trauell in the Vineyard of our Lord: but also I haue further signified vnto you, the fruit and increase which dayly pro∣ceedeth from our labours, sometimes by Preaching, Teaching and bapti∣zing Mahometans, whose conuersi∣on is most hard: Other sometimes by reducing the poore deceiued soules of the Armenians, Nestorians, Iacobites, and other such like, vnto the Faith of Christ, which are heere in great number; and haue little of Christianity, more then the Name; a∣mongst whom wee doe much good, and gather great plenty of fruit into the storehouse of our Lord, which is the greatest comfort wee inioy in these Desarts of Infidelity. This onely heretofore, hath beene a discomfort vnto vs, that this our
Mission on our behalfes, hath gone on too fauourably, and hath not beene accompanied with tortures, torments, Imprisonments, and effusion of our Blood, for the Gospell of Christ which we professe, and desire to plant in these partes; as we reade of in other Missions; and are necessary for vs to suffer, aswell for the testimony of the Truth, as for the edification of o∣thers; and incouraging them to bee constant in the Faith; which hitherto God hath not bestowed vpon vs, though we often desire it at his hands, for confirmation of his Truth. True, it is, that heretofore there hath not beene wanting, nor yet at this present there is wanting, occasi∣ons, and opportunities, to merit, and to offer something to our Lord: yet generally the King heere though a Mahometan, hath heretofore alwayes shewed towards vs, so great signes of affection and loue; that for our sakes he hath not molested any Christian, vnder the name and title of a Christi∣an: But if at any time hee hath con∣strained some of the Armenians to
deny their Faith; he hath done it vn∣der colour, that they haue otherwise displeased him, or for that they had not wherewithall to pay him, that which they ought, or vnder some o∣ther pretext; vntill now of late with∣in these few dayes, it hath pleased his Diuine Maiesty in part, to heare our Prayers, and to comfort his Chil∣dren, by giuing them a taste of the sweetnesse, which those inioy, who shed their blood, and yeeld their liues for his loue, though it hath not beene fully accomplished in vs, yet so it is that he hath giuen vs a little taste, to strengthen our hopes, that hereafter it may be fully accomplish∣ed in vs; for not many dayes agoe, he hath blessed this Mission with the happy Death of fiue Martyrs, and watered it with their Blood: so that now wee hope that it will yeeld a most plentifull haruest, to the great content of all our Congregation, but especially to your Reuerence who hath beene so great a fauourer of it. Amongst other Persians which in these last Monthes we haue Baptized
heere at Haspahan; there were fiue (that is to say) Elia, Chassadir, (his Cozen) Alexander, Ioseph, and He∣brani. Elia hath serued vs sometimes in our house, and was the Husband of that Theresa, of which I made men∣tion in my former Letters, who was likewise Baptized by our Fathers; and after Baptisme God gaue her so great Zeale; that like an Apostolike Woman, shee preached and publish∣ed the Name of Iesus Christ in all pla∣ces; and trauailing into her Countrey, which is a Prouince of the Ringdome of Sciras, subiect to the King of Per∣sia, she conuerted diuers, and with the rest the aforesaid Chassadir, and in those partes enkindled in them such a desire of Christianity, as that the Gouernour of that Prouince sent diuers times, and lastly his owne pro∣per Sonne to our Fathers in Haspahan, earnestly intreating them to send two Fathers vnto them, to the intent to teach them the Faith of Iesus Christ; which at that time could not be exe∣cuted, because the King of Persia was then incensed against the Portugals,
preparing to wage war against them in Ormus, (being an Island of the King of Spaines in the East Indies, somewhat further distant from the firme land, then his other Kingdomes are) as accordingly he shortly after∣ward performed. These foresaid fiue Christians be∣ing Baptized at seuerall times, and in∣structed for some weekes, in the my∣steries of the holy faith, departed to make their aboade in their owne houses. But we perceiuing the Kings indignation to increase against the Francans (Francks in Persia are cal∣led the Christians that follow the cu∣stome of the Latines, to distinguish them from the Greekes, Armenians, and others) thought it more safe, for them to retire themselues to Ormus▪ thereby both to secure themselues from the Kings fury, and the better▪ also to confirme them in the holy faith: To this effect Father Iohn of St. Eliseus (who hath bin long times Vicar generall of the reformed Car∣melits in these Countries) wrote vnto our Fathers, who resided there▪ and
to a Captaine of Ormus, that they would entertaine them, and prouide for them there, vntill the Kings in∣dignation was ouer-passed. Hee sent his Letters by Elia, as by one who best knew the wayes, and the pra∣ctise of the Country, and in whom he put the more confidence, for that he had serued in our house. Elia trauai∣led onwards with great alacrity, al∣though hee fore-saw the great perill, whereunto he was exposed, for at that time the Country was all in Armes, and Ormus was besieged by the Persians. But the ardent desire, which this seruant of God had to en∣dure any thing whatsoeuer for his sake, made him set light by al dangers, and thence-forth chusing only for his Cōpanion in the iourney, his aforesaid Cousin Cassadir, he went cheerefully forward, vntill that in his way, he was discouered by an English-man, where∣of some are resident in Persia, to traf∣ficke with the King for Silke, which they finde there, and brought to be accused before the Chan, that is to say▪ the Duke that gouerned the said
Kingdome of Sciras, in the name of the King of Persia, as his Vice-roy, who was going to the siege of Ormus, who presently shut him vp in prison, and searching him, found the Letters, which after he had perused, he caused him to be racked, and asked him what he was? Elia answered that he was a Francke, whereupon the Chan or Duke commaunded him, that hee should speake in the language of a Francke, but being ignorant of the language, he pawsed a while, and then said, that he was a Christian Francke, (which is as much as to say, in the Persian tongue, a Christian Catho∣lique, or one that yeeldeth obedience to the Pope) afterwards the Chan asked Cassadir, Cousin to Elia, what he was, and whither he went, and vp∣on what affaires? and finding him to be a Christian newly Baptized, who went to accompany his Cousin, and that they had no other businesse, but to carie the Letters hee found about them, out of the hatred hee bore to Christians: the Chan begun to be en∣raged like a dogge, and endeauoured
by diuers meanes, that is to say, by threatnings, torments, perswasions, and promises, to make these two new Disciples of Iesus Christ, to deny the holy faith, and to returne to the false obseruance of Mahomet: But GOD (who neuer abandoneth those which trauaile for him, and put their trust in him) fauoured them with so great a∣boundance of his graces, that they set light by the threats, and torments, and respected not the promises of the Tyrant; but freely confessed that they were Christians, and that GOD had shewed his fauour vnto them, to draw them out of the darknesse of in∣fidelity, and the false sect and doc∣trine of Mahomet, to the end they might know the true and onely faith of Iesus Christ, in which they were both of them resolued to liue and dye. The words of Elia like darts pier∣ced the heart of the Chan▪ who inra∣ged with new indignation, com∣maunded them to be caried into the sight of Ormus, (eight dayes distant from that place where they were at
that time) and in the presence of the Christians of that Citie to bee put to death, in such manner, as heare after shall bee declared. In these eight dayes of trauaile they were most in∣humanely handled and iniured, in∣during hunger, thirst, and watching, to which the cruell instruments of the diuell, fierce in heart, and sauage in behauiour, added another more greater, which was to labour diuers times, to take from them the preci∣ous treasure of the sacred faith▪ some∣times by threats, other whiles by promises, now by flatteries, and a∣gaine by stripes, vnder pretext to make them Runnagates and Aposta∣taes. But these true seruants of God, tried like fine gold in the midst of so many persecutions, suffered and in∣dured all these cruelties, with ioy of spirit, and vnspeakeable constancie, yeelding thankes to our good Lord Iesus Christ, for the grace he besto∣wed on them, in making them wor∣thy to suffer, and endure anything for his loue, and for the holy faith, which they had receiued in Bap∣tisme.
Being argued in sight of Or∣mus, these fierce and cruell ministers flayed an Asse, and sowed the Mar∣tyr Elia in the skinne, and afterwards nayled him on high to a great peece of wood: he liued in this most cruell torment some houres, praising and blessing God, and preaching the faith of Iesus Christ, after the best manner he could. Cassadir was alwayes pre∣sent at this spectacle, who in stead of astonishment, and loosing his cou∣rage, for the torments that were in∣flicted vpon his Cousin, was the more animated, and remained alwayes con∣stant, confessing Iesus Christ, and re∣iecting with an holy disdaine, all those that counsailed him to returne vnto the Sect of Mahomet, which was the cause that they tyed him to a Stake, and ripped vp his belly. Thus those two holy Martyrs finished their fraile life, to the end to possesse and begin another eternall, and happy; in∣somuch as the ministers of cruelty, and those other Infidels that were there present, remained confused and astonished, at the constancie of those
two Martyrs. I could not as yet vn∣derstand what became of the bodies of these two glorious Martyrs, but I hope that God will preserue and re∣serue so great a treasure. The Chan of Sciras being infor∣med by these two glorious Martyrs Elia, and Cassadir, what those three other Christians were, which accor∣ding to the Fathers Letters, were to be sent to Ormus, and hauing notice both of their names, by which they were baptized, as for the others, they had when they were yet Mahome∣tans, signified the whole proceedings by his Letters to the King of Persia, and sent him those Letters which the holy Martyr Elia was to carie to Or∣mus. The King hauing receiued this newes (who at that time was three Leagues from the Citie) commanded the foresaid three Christians to be ap∣prehended, who were not as yet de∣parted, and commanded the Daraga (that is to say, the Gouernour of the Citie of Haspaphan) and the Cap∣taine of the Campe, to repaire vnto our Couent, and shut vs vp therein:
which they punctually performed, locking, and sealing vp the Cells of the Couent, and shutting all of vs to∣gether in one Chamber: After this, they asked Father Iohn, whether hee thought he had done well, or that it were fitting, that hee should be the cause of such a matter, considering that the King had alwayes entertai∣ned, and honoured him? Where∣vnto the Father answered, that hee came not into Persia for the honours and fauours which the King had be∣stowed on him; but for the only hope he had, not only to conuert the King, but his whole Kingdome to the faith of Iesus Christ. With this answer the Gouernour and the Captaine of Iu∣stice, departed, leauing the Monasta∣rie full of Souldiers: God so would that one of the Fathers was yet fast∣ing (notwithstanding that it was more then two of the clocke after∣noone) and thus consumated hee the holy Sacrament. That night they for∣bad vs to performe our accustomed spirituall exercises, beleeuing that we would set some Charmes, and Sor∣ceries
a worke. Yet did wee that which vpon such like occasion, the Prophet. Daniel did. Your Reue∣rence may consider in what estate we were, the house being full of Watch∣men, and Sergeants that were Infi∣dels, the gates of the Monastarie locked, when as we might not speake to any of our friends, or know what was done, but were all of vs closed vp in a Chamber, preparing our selues to giue our liues for Iesus Christ. One onely thing afflicted vs, which was, that wee could not giue succours to the new Christians▪ knowing for certaine, that they suffe∣red great necessity of all things, and for that wee could not counsell, and animate them, being doubtfull of their perseuerance in the faith. At that time, wee betooke our selues to our prayers, beseeching our Lord to giue them force, and perse∣uerance, offering vp our prayers to the two holy Martyrs Elia, and Cassa∣dir, to the end they should interceede, and pray for them. Wee remained prisoners thus, for three dayes space,
during which time, each of vs prepa∣red himselfe to dye, and made a ge∣nerall confession after the best man∣ner we could. The first day we read the life of St. Ignatius the Martyr, the second of St. Lawrence, and the third that of St. Katherine. I cannot ex∣presse vnto you the consolation, and inward ioy that we felt, nor the fer∣uour, or sensible apprehension and zeale of the Fathers: euery houre was vnto vs a thousand, whilst we expe∣cted to giue vp our liues for Iesus Christs sake, and no lesse able am I to expresse vnto you, the desire which we had, that our deaths might be ac∣companied with many torments, nei∣ther the feruent acts which we did to that effect. We tasted (deare Father) of the force, and efficacie of Gods grace▪ and the fidelity which God vseth to∣wards those who expose themselues to dangers, by the meanes of holy obedience; in such sort, that mee thought I saw, that which in such like occations God operated in the Primi∣tiue Church. The second day of our imprison∣ment,
the King sent these Letters to Father Iohn (by a Secretarie, to the Gouernour of the Citie) which hee had written by the holy Martyr Elia to Father Baltaser, and the Captaine of Ormus, with the interpretation of the same, but vnfaithfully and cor∣ruptly translated by the direction of the Chan of Sciras, commanding him to certifie him, whether these Letters were his, and whether they were well interpreted, and that hee should interpret them himselfe, and call to his remembrance what honours and fa∣uours he had done him, and whether this was the acknowledgement which he ought him, and the reward of the bread and salt they had eaten toge∣ther; intending hereby, how often times the King had inuited our Fa∣thers to eate with him, perticularly vpon the occasions of the arriuall of great Ambassadours, and at Feasts, at which time, the King is accusto∣med to make great banquets, to which hee alwayes inuited Father Iohn, with some other Fathers, honou∣ring them very much vpon such like
occasions, placing them alwayes neere himselfe, feasting them at his owne dish, and doing such like things: (This is a phrase amongst the Persians to say, they inuite them to eate bread and salt, when they inuite to a ban∣quet.) Father Iohn read the interpre∣tation of his owne Letters▪ which the King had sent him, and finding them full of lyes, and falshoods; hee inter∣preted them, and signified to the Messenger, which was sent vnto him by the King, that hee acknowledged the graces, and honours which he had alwayes receiued at his Maiesties hands, that those were his Letters; and that it was true, that he had bap∣tized those fiue. And being deman∣ded why he Baptized them? the Fa∣ther answered: why doth the King inforce Christians to forsake their faith, and become Mahometans? as his Maiestie endeauoureth for Maho∣met, so will I doe my vttermost for Iesus Christ, in whose place I am here set: and for this cause, who so euer they be, that desire to become Chri∣stians, those will I freely baptize, be∣ing
onely sent into these Countries, with these my Companions, to that intent. The Ministers deliuered the answere, which the Father sent to the King, who was highly contented, both with the interpretation which the Father had made of his owne Let∣ters, which he had sent vnto Ormus, (being much different from those which were sent him by the Chan of Sciras, translated wholy into a con∣trary sence, and as it may be thought, by some enemies of our holy faith) as also with his constancie, and for that cause, the King said the Father had reason. Full two hundred Mulaz (which are the Doctors of Mahomets law) were present with the King, when the Fathers answere was brought vnto him, who making some tumult, and noyse; and almost mad with anger, were assembled there, to the end to complaine vnto his Maiestie, for that the law of Mahomet grew out of re∣quest, and for that we had sent more then fiue thousand baptized Persians into Christendome, inciting him to re∣medy
the same, and prouoking his displeasure against vs. The King be∣ing much displeased, turning him∣selfe towards them (after hee had heard the Fathers answere) reuiled, and taunted them with bitter spee∣ches, telling them, that the Father had reason; but that they were villaines, and old crafty Foxes, commaunding them out of his presence: saying, for sixteene yeeres space, I haue frequen∣ted the Fathers company, yet hath he neuer told me any vntruth, neither haue I found any ill beseeming beha∣uiour amongst the Fathers, and I hold them for honest men. Hereupon the Mulaz departed, confused: At this time the King expressed the affection which hee bare to Father Iohn, which truly is very great, whereupon wee suppose, that the seuerity which at this present he sheweth, and hereto∣fore vsed towards the Christians his Subiects, as to the Armenians and others, euill intreating them, and per∣mitting sometimes, that their children should be made slaues, and forcing some of them to deny their faith, is to
no other end, but to giue some satis∣faction to the Mulaz, and the peo∣ple; in that hee feareth some reuolt, hauing perticularly discouered diuers times conspiracies against himselfe, whereby he stoode in danger both of his life, and Kingdome, wherein one of his sonnes was intended to be pla∣ced, which hath beene the cause that he hath put two of his sons to death, and as it is presumed, hath caused the third in like sort to be slaine, to the in∣tent to leaue one of his eldest sonnes children, to succeede him in the King∣dome, who as yet is a little Infant, and incapable of the Empire. True it is also, that the King natu∣rally is both angry and chollericke, both by reason of the conspiracies which haue beene also addressed a∣gainst him, as for the death which he hath inflicted on his owne naturall children, so that this passion hath gotten so great power ouer him, that sometimes he seemeth to be out of his wits, and at that time acteth beastly resolutions. All these thinges being thus past betwixt the King, and the
Father, the King commaunded those three prisoners to be brought before him, that were imprisoned in the Ci∣tie of Haspahan, by reason of the in∣telligence the Chan of Sciras had gi∣uen him, together with these sixe o∣ther, who desired to bee Christians, and were ready to receiue sacred bap∣tisme, being for this cause also com∣mitted to prison. The King himselfe asked them whether they were Chri∣stians or no? to whom these Catechu∣men▪ answered together, with two of the three other Christians, (that is to say Ioseph, and Hebrain) that they were none; Alexander onely answe∣red with great courage, that he was a Christian. The King commaunded him to forsake his faith, and to returne to Mahometisme: Whereupon Alex∣ander, with greater feruour, and free∣nesse of spirit, said, that he would ne∣uer commit such a sinne, as to sepe∣rate himselfe from the true faith of Iesus Christ, for the false Doctrine of Mahomet, and that he hoped through the mercy of God, to liue and die a Christian. The King▪ being strangely
moued by this free and confident an∣swere (as one who was vnaccusto∣med to heare replyes, and contradi∣ctions to his commaundements) sen∣tenced him to bee presently stoned to Death, and afterwards burned to Ashes. The ministers sodainly exe∣cuted the Kings commaund, and hap∣py Alexander publiquely confessing Iesus Christ, gaue him thankes, for that hee thought him worthy to loose his life for his sake. We cānot as yet, learne the other particularities of this glorious seruant of God, because the Execution was sodaine, and with∣out the Citty: wee onely know that the Reliques are in the handes of the Christians, and are kept by them with honour and reuerence. The other eight (that is to say) the two Christians and the sixe Catechu∣mens, who had beene brought before the King, with the holy Martyr A∣lexander, were by his Maiesties com∣maundment led vnto Father Iohn, to know which were the two that were Baptized, for all of them had denyed themselues to be Christians. We thus
locked vp as wee haue signified vnto you, the next day following about an houre within Night, whilest we were occupied in mentall Prayer which we vse to make for one houre in the E∣uening and another in the Morning; behold the Eight inchayned Priso∣ners, together with the ministers of Cruelty, came vnto vs, commaunding the Father to certifie them, which of those were the two Christians. The Father animated and exhorted them, to confesse the true and holy Faith, which he had taught them, and that God had engraued in them by holy Baptisme, and which they, with so much gladnes, had at that time testi∣fied; and also shewed vnto them, that it was not lawfull for Christians to deny the Name of Iesus Christ, at such time as they are constrained to confesse the same, and afterwards hee tolde these whom the King had sent, that Ioseph and Hebrain were the two, which he had Bap∣tized (for the Father knew that the King was well informed of all) one of these two relented a little, because
the Father had discouered him, vtte∣ring forth certaine wordes, whereby hee discouered his apprehension of the danger, the other spake not one word. Heere we haue an occasion, wonderfully to admire the meanes which his Diuine Maiesty vsed at this time, to assist those two soules, and to crowne them with the crowne of holy Martyrdome, prouoking e∣uen the very ministers of Cruelty, who led them to Martyrdome, to a∣nimate them vnto Death for the loue of Iesus Christ; for one of them said, be not afraid of Death, because it is our most assured heritage: Thou art a Christian, dye then in the Faith of Iesus Christ; Another said this life passeth in a moment, you shall goe and liue with Iesus Christ: The last said, Iesus Christ is aliue, and is not dead as Mahomet is; continue con∣stant, and you shall ascend to the fourth Heauen of Iesus Christ. The next day earely in the mor∣ning, they brought vs backe the Eight that were chayned together, and with them a Portugall called Sebastian
Duz, taken Prisoner by the Kings Souldiers in his Warres, and for that cause detained in Prison in Haspahan; this did God ordaine for his greater Glory, and the ayde of these new Christians: Father Iohn, issued out of the Gate, with Bread to distribute amongst them, and to refresh them a little, but the Catechumens would take none, yet did Ioseph and Hebrain receiue the same, and gaue thereof likewise to Sebastian Duz, entertai∣ning Father Iohn with a ioyfull coun∣tenance, and great contentment, who called all the other Fathers and Reli∣gious, for the common consolation of all, and after he had exhorted the two Christians to perseuerance, and with∣out feare to confesse their God and Sauiour, who gaue himselfe for our Redemption, and to esteeme it to bee a great grace and blessing to be repu∣ted his Martyrs, and to remember themselues of the vertue, courage, and constancy, of their three companions, Elia, Cassadir, and Alexander, who like glorious Saints, enioy and for e∣uer shall enioy Eternall glory: whose
intercession he promised them, as also our prayers; but aboue all the ayde and assistance of Iesus Christ in their passion, and that their torments would seeme sweet, and pleasant vnto them: After this each one with teares in our eyes, imbraced each other, enuying their happines, and reputing our selues not worthy of so great a fauour, we tooke our leaue of them, and they departed comforted, ioyfull, and in∣uested with a new Spirit; but we re∣mained sad and afflicted, for that we were depriued of the Crowne of Martyrdome, which wee so much desired: wee setled our selues to prayers, to assist them the best that wee could, considering that it was not permitted to vs, to doe otherwise, neither to accompany them as wee desired, and as we endeauored to doe. But Sebastian Duz sufficiently sup∣plyed our places, heartning, comfor∣ting, and inciting them alwayes to be∣haue themselues like the true souldi∣ers of Iesus Christ. They two with the other seauen, which were in chaynes, that is to say,
Sebastian Duz, with the sixe Cate∣chumens in religion, were led through the Citty of Haspahan, and turned three times about the same, and were then conueyed to the Kings presence, meane while Sebastian Duz with the two new Christians, confessed al∣wayes (both passing thorough the Citty, and in the way, with a loude voyce, and in the Kings presence) the Name of Iesus Christ. The King see∣ing this, commaunded that Ioseph and Hebrain, should bee stoned to Death, and their Bodyes to be bur∣ned, and that Sebastian Duz, with the sixe Catechumens, should be led backe to Prison: and to this purpose it was Proclaimed throughout the Citty of Haspahan, that those that loued Mahomet should repaire to the Execution place, with Stones to chastice those, who had denyed the Faith of Mahomet. Being arriued at the place where this Execution of these two happy Christians, was to bee performed, The Gouernour of the Citty who is an Apostata, and hath abiured Christian Religion,
alighted from his Horse, & taking the Mulaz with him to asst him, enfor∣ced himselfe to perswade these two Martyrs, to make profession of the Law of Mahomet, attempting them, with their ordinary, carnall, and tem∣porall reasons, promising them not onely their liues, and the Kings par∣don, but also great Rewards, consi∣dering that not onely the matter con∣cerned and hazarded their reputati∣on, but also the credit of their Pro∣phet Mahomet: Ioseph answered with great courage, saying; That al∣though he were the first that denyed himselfe to bee a Christian, at such time as the King questioned him thereupon, yet now in no sort hee would commit such an errour, for that the offence he had committed was too great already, when in the Kings presence hee had denyed him∣selfe to bee a Christian, hoping that our Lord Iesus Christ, who had shew∣ed him so much fauour, as to call him to become a Christian, would now giue him grace and force to suffer Death for his loue: Whereupon
they that were about him, and parti∣cularly the Mulaz tooke vp stones to stone him, which, whilest they per∣formed, the Saint hauing his Head al∣ready broken and in peeces, cryed out with a loude voyce: Blessed bee the holy Name of Iesus, his Faith is holy and true; and that of Maho∣mets is false, and no man can be saued thereby; But Brethren God pardon you, and giue you his holy light: tel∣ling them further, that hee felt no paine. Hebrain, that was the last to dye for Iesus Christ, was tempted and likewise assaulted anew, to deny the holy Faith, and to professe and protest that of Mahomet, whereunto hee answered; that he would not doe it, and that hee was a true Disciple of Iesus Christ, the true God, and true Man, wishing them, that they should not loose any more time to perswade him to such lyes, and that they should not delay any longer, to bestow that Crowne on him, which his compani∣ons enioyed in Paradice, and that he was disposed to shed his Blood for him, and for his Loue, who with so
great excesse of loue▪ had giuen his Corporall life for them and him, to the end to giue them an Eternall life: And whilest they bound and fastned him to the stake, he said to the Mini∣sters of his Execution, that hee par∣doned them, and desired that God would not demaund accompt of his Blood at their hands. It is impossi∣ble to expresse with what rage these Ministers of the Deuill stoned this holy Martyr, out of the dispite they had, for that they could not peruert him, whereupon they remained wholly confused and derided by all men. Hauing stoned these two Saints, they burned their Bodyes, and set a watch ouer the reliques and ashes of the Saints, yet notwith∣standing the Christians gathered them all vp, so that nothing was left vnpreserued. The Kings Ministers repented themselues for that they had Execu∣ted the Martyrs, because they did not beleeue, that so great a constancy could bee in the Saints, considering the torments which they suffered,
and the rather, because they saw so great a murmure amongst the people, who flocked together in great multi∣tudes, to see the spectacle they had neuer seene, and they openly said, that the faith of the Christians was more strong, and better then theirs: Whilst this Martyrdome was a do∣ing, wee that were locked vp, and guarded by our ordinary Watch∣men, prayed God that his holy name might be sanctified in these his Saints. Not long after this the King departed and went to Kanda, where his Army attended him; but before his depar∣ture, hee caused the Catechumens in Christian Religion, to be set at liber∣ty, and ordained, that not onely they should haue their free liberty, but that they should be honoured, and and left free as they were before, to doe their offices in our Church. Sig∣nifying hereby, that what hee had done, hee had done against his will. But as we remained in the Ministers hands, and the King was farre distant from vs, they left vs one of the guard in the ent, saying, that the King
had so commaunded them, but this was not a guard but a Mamonda (that is to say a guard of guests or strangers) and for this cause the Chri∣stians frequented not our Church, as they were accustomed. But GOD draweth the best from all things, for by this persecution, wee haue gotten the loue of diuers Persians, and are in good reputation with them, and those that kept vs, testifie our pouerty in all places, and that we are good Chri∣stians, which wee could not haue ob∣tained in our prosperity. The sensible apprehension that all the Citie shew∣eth, giues vs great occasion to praise God, because all of them thought, that wee should haue beene put to death, by diuers torments. For go∣ing once along the Citie, and making some little walke, presently after the death of these Martyrs, they all be∣held vs, with ioy and contentment, and great reuerence, blessing GOD. Although as yet, wee are vnder the afore-said guard, and in a manner im∣prisoned, yet doe we say our offices in the Church, and we ring our bells
(which are very good) as we did be∣fore, and as you doe in Europe, and notwithstanding our need of money, wherewith we are pressed, yet within these few dayes, wee haue bought a very good Bell, for feare least the o∣ther should bee broken, hoping in God that we shall one day see them, in the best Idolatrous Church in this Citie (that is to say) in the Synagogue of the Mahometans. Wee remaine very much comforted, and the rather because wee already see the efficacie of the intercession, which those fiue Martyrs make for this Mission, en∣ioying the fruit of their bloud, wher∣with it is watered, hoping to haue greater one day, and to see through∣out this whole Kingdome, the holy Crosse triumphantly erected, which God graunt for his great and infinite mercy sake. The Parents of the Martyrs are ve∣ry well affected towards vs, diuers of the most Learned and Principals of Haspahan, send vs salutations, excu∣sing themselues, that for the present they cannot come to salute vs in per∣son,
because as yet those thinges that are past, are new, and fresh in memo∣ry: And although we are thus closed vp, I will not say Imprisoned, yet some haue not failed to come vnto vs (although with great danger) impor∣tuning vs to Baptize them. The For∣ty three Territories of the Armenian Christians, who are vnder the Kings Obedience (as at other times I haue certified your Reuerence by my Let∣ters) had playde the Apostataes, in another Persecution, and were for the most part become Mahometans, (although as I beleeue it was not in heart) by the example of these fiue Martyrs, they haue all of them decla∣red themselues to bee Christians, and protest they are ready to dye for CRHISTS sake and his Loue. The King hath taken no notice hereof, but hath commaunded, that euery one should liue according to that Faith wherein hee was borne, and to the a∣foresaid Forty Territories, he hath made restitution of their Christian Bookes, which the Persians had ta∣ken from them, when they abjured.
These are the fruites of the Death, and intercession of these Fiue glori∣ous Martyrs. There are some, that for the present labour to put this Infor∣mation into an authenticall forme by a publique Notary, with many wit∣nesses, which were present at this fa∣mous Martyrdome, amongst which there shall bee the Ministers of the King: which once obtained, I will send it to your Reuerence, with all the other particularities that may be knowne, to the end, you may make vse of them at Rome. I will certifie your Reuerence no further as touching the workmen in this Mission, least I should grow too tedious, but this, that they liue in great obseruance, and with such per∣fection, as if this house were a Noui∣ship, and they Nouices. They hum∣bly require the Prayers of our Con∣gregation, and especially and particu∣larly those of your Reuerence, and your holy Benediction, in which wee haue much confidence. Beseeching you to succour this Mission, and to send labourers, for the Haruest is
great, and your Reuerence may be∣leeue me, that sometimes my heart bursteth (if I may so speake it) with compassion seeing them still crying out for the Bread of the sacred Gos∣pell, and that wee cannot assist them all, as we earnestly desire: The zeale of your Reuerence permitteth me not to speake any further, knowing what desire you haue to assist this Mission, with the hazard of your blood. Our Lord reward you, and preserue vs, as wee pray to that effect. From Haspahan the Eleuenth of Aprill. 1622.
