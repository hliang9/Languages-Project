FOR The Colony in Virginea BRITANNIA. Lavves Diuine, Morall and Martiall, &c. Alget qui non Ardet. Res nostrae subinde non sunt, quales quis optaret, sed quales esse possunt. Printed at London for Walter Burre. 1612.
To the Right Honourable his sin∣gular good Lord, the Lord LAWARR, of the heroyicke and Religious Plantation in VIRGINIA-BRITANIA, the sole perso∣nall Aduancer, his Maiesties Lord Gouernour and Captaine GENERALL. OF all things we enioy, the Founders worth Is still most praide for: In attempts of warre, The Chargers fame is euer most set forth: Of all things founded true Religion farre, We are worthyest Palme, and merits holyest meede: This then Heroyicke Lord your glorie shrines, That y'are sole personall Lord of this great deede, Which more by all else shund the more it shines: Skorne then all common Aymes, and euery Act Where euery vulgar, thrusts for profit on, Nor praise; nor prise affect, like the meere Fact Nor any other Honour build vpon, Then onely this, since 'tis for Christs deare word, You shall be surnam'd; The most Christian Lord. By an vnworthy follower of the same fortune, your Lord∣ships Seruant, William Strachey.
To the much Honoured, in all Na∣tions acknowledged the most renowned famous Factor and Professor of all Actions that haue the warrant of Religion, Honour or goodnesse, Sir THOMAS SMITH Knight, and in this piou Plantation of Virginia-Britania, the vnremoueable cordiall friend, and right bounteous & well chosen TREASVRER. SIR, if the traffique with all Nations, (Vent'ring your Purse for profit) hath renown'd Your noble minde with all mens commendations, For this diuine gaine, it is triple Croun'd, In which you traffique not with men, but God: Not venturing, but surely gaining Soules: Not onely such as Idlenesse had trod, As low as hell, and giuen their flesh to Fowles, In our owne Countrey: but such soules beside, As liuing like the sonne of Earth, the Moule Haue neuer yet Heauens sauing light descry'd: More then the world he gaines, that gaines a soule: Which but your selfe, though few or none esteeme, Assures your soule a heauenly Diademe. William Strachey.
To the Right Honorable, the Lords of the Councell of Virginea. NOblest of men, though tis the fashion now Noblest to mixe with basest, for their gaine: Yet doth it fare farre otherwise with you, That scorne to turne to Chaos so againe, And follow your supreme distinction still, Till of most noble, you become diuine And imitate your maker in his will, To haue his truth in blackest nations shine. VVhat had you beene, had not your Ancestors Begunne to you, that make their nobles good? And where white Christians turne in maners Mores You wash Mores white with sacred Christā bloud This wonder ye, that others nothing make; Forth thē (great LL.) for your Lords Sauiors sake. By him, all whose duty is tributary to your Lordships, and vnto so excellent a cause. William Strachey.
To the constant, mighty, and wor∣thie friends, the Commities, Assistants vnto his Maiesties Councell for the Colonie in VIRGINEA-BRITANNIA. WHen I went forth vpon this voyage, (Right worthy Gentlemen) true it is, I held it a seruice of dutie, (during the time of my vnprofitable seruice, and purpose of stay in the Colonie, for which way else might I adde vnto the least hight of so Heroicke and pious a building) to propose vnto my self to be (though an vnable) Remembrancer of all ac∣cidents, occurrences, and vndertakings thereunto, aduen∣titiall: In most of which since the time our right famous sole Gouernour then; now Lieutenant Generall Sir Tho∣mas Gates Knight, after the ensealing of his Commis∣sion hasted to our fleete in the West, there staying for him, I haue both in the Bermudas, and since in Virginea beene a sufferer and an eie witnesse, and the full storie of both in due time shall consecrate vnto your viewes, as vnto whom by right it appertaineth, being vowed patrones of a worke, and enterprise so great, then which no obiect nor action (the best of bests) in these times, may carry with it the like fame, honour, or goodnesse. Howbet since many impediments, as yet must detaine such my obseruations in the shadow of darknesse, vntill I shall be able to deliuer them perfect vnto your iudgements,
I shall prouoke and challenge) I do in the meanetime present a transcript of the Toparchia or State of those duties, by which the Colonie stands regulated and com∣maunded, that such may receiue due chicke, who maliti∣ously and desperately heretoforè haue censured of it, and by examining of which they may be right sorie so to haue de∣faulked from vs as if we liued there lawlesse, without o∣bedience to our Countrey, or obseruancie of Religion to God. Nor let it afflict the patience of such full and well in∣structed iudgements, vnto whom many of these constituti∣ons and Lawes Diuine or Marshall may seeme auncient and common, since these grounds are the same constant, Asterismes, and starres, which must guide all that trauell in thse perplexed wayes, and paths of publique affairs; & whosoeuer shall wander from them, shall but decline a hazardous and by-course to bring their purposes to good effect. Nor let another kind quarrell or traduce the Printing of them to be deliuered in particular to officers and pri∣uate Souldiers for their better instruction, especially vn∣to a Company for the , vnsetled and vnfurnished, since we know well how short our memories are often∣times, and vnwilling to giue stoge to the better things, and such things as limit and bound mankind in their ne∣cessariest duties. For which it transcends not the reach of his vnderstan∣ding, who is conuersant, if but as for a festiuall exercise, (euery  Moone) in reading of a booke, that re∣cords and edcts for manners or ciuill duties, haue vsually beene fixed vpon ingrauen Tables, for the Commons dai∣ly to ouerlooke: a custome more especially cherished by
those not many yeeres since in Magnuza who haue resto∣red (as I m say) after so great a floud and rage of abused goodness, all Lawes, literature and Vertue againe, which had well nigh perished, had not the force of piety and sa∣cred reason remaining in the bosomes of some few, oppo∣sed it selfe against the fury of so great a calamity, of whom it is an vndenyable truth, that the meanes and way wher∣by they reduced the generall defction, was by printing thereby so houlding vppe those inuolued principles, and Instructions wherein (as in a mirror, the blind and wan∣dering iudgement might suruaye, what those know∣ledges were, which taught both how to gouerne, and how to obey, (the end indeed of sociable mankinds Creation) since without order and gouernment, (the onely hendges, whereupon, not onely the safety, but the being of all states doe turne and depend) what society may possible subsist, or commutatiue goodnesse be practised. And thus laws being published, euery common eye may take suruey of their duties, and carrying away the tenour of the same, meditate, & bethinke how safe, quiet, and comely it is to be honest, iust, and ciuill. And indeed all the sacred powers of knowledge and wisedome are strengthned by these two waies, either by a kind of diuine nature, which his happy creation hath bles∣sed him with, the vertue whereof comprehendeth, fore∣seeth and vnderstandeth the truth and cleerenesse of all things: or by instruction and tradition from others, which must improue his wants, and by experience render him perfect, awaking him in all seasons a vigilant obser∣uer of ciuill cautions and ordinances, an excellent reason inforcing no lesse vnto the knowledge of him that will shine a starre in the firmament, where good men moue,
and that is, that no man doth more ill then hee that is ignorant. For the auoiding of which, and to take away the plea of I did not know in him that shall exorbitate or goe aside with any delinquencie which may be dangerous in exam∣ple or execution, albeit true it is how hee is indeede the good and honest man that will be good, and to that needeth fewe other precepts. It hath appeared most necessary vnto our present Ethnarches Deputy Gouernor Sir Thomas Dale knight Marshall, not onely to exemplifie the olde Lawes of the Colony, by Sir Thomas Gates published & put in execution by our Lord Generall Laware during his time one whole yeere of being there, but by vertue of his office, to prescribe and draw new, with their due pe∣naltyes, according vnto which wee might liue in the Co∣lony iustly one with another, and performe the generall seruice for which we first came thither, and with so great charges & expences, are now setled & maintained there. For my paines, and gathering of them, as I know they will be right welcom to such young souldiers in the Colony who are desirous to learne and performe their duties, so I assure me, that by you I shall bee encouraged to go on in the discharge of greater offices by examining and fauou∣ring my good intention in this, and in what else my poore knowledge or faithfulnesse may enable me to be a seruant in so beloued and sacred a businesse. And euen so com∣mitting to your still most abstract, graue and vnsatisfied carefulnesse, both it and my selfe, I wish returne of seuen fold into such his well inspired bosome, who hath lent his helping hand vnto this new Sion. From my lodging in the blacke Friers. At your best pleasures, either to returne vnto the Colony, or to pray for the successe of it heere. WILLIAM STRACHEY.

WHereas his Maiestie like himselfe a most zealous Prince hath in his owne Realmes a principall care of true Religion, and reuerence to God, and hath alwaies strictly commaunded his Generals and Gouernours, with all his forces wheresoeuer, to let their waies be like his ends, for the glorie of God. And forasmuch as no good seruice can be perfor∣med, or warre well managed, where militarie disci∣pline is not obserued, and militarie discipline can∣not be kept, where the rules or chiefe parts there∣of,
be not certainely set downe, and generally knowne, I haue (with the aduise and counsell of Sir Thomas Gates Knight, Lieutenant Generall) adhe∣red vnto the lawes diuine, and orders politique, and martiall of his Lordship (the same exemplified) an addition of such others, as I haue found either the necessitie of the present State of the Colonie to re∣quire, or the infancie, and weaknesse of the bodie thereof, as yet able to digest, and doe now publish them to all persons in the Colonie, that they may as well take knowledge of the Lawes themselues, as of the penaltie and punishment, which without par∣tialitie shall be inflicted vpon the breakers of the same. 1 FIrst since we owe our highest and su∣preme duty, our greatest, and all our alle∣geance to him, from whom all power and authoritie is deriued, and flowes as from the first, and onely fountaine, and being especiall souldiers em∣prest in this sacred cause, we must alone expect our successe from him, who is onely the blesser of all good attempts, the King of kings, the commaunder of commaunders, and Lord of Hostes, I do strictly commaund and charge all Captaines and Officers, of what qualitie or nature soeuer, whether comman∣ders in the field, or in towne, or townes, forts or for∣tresses, to haue a care that the Almightie God bee duly and daily serued, and that they call vpon their people to heare Sermons, as that also they diligent∣ly frequent Morning and Euening praier themselues by their owne exemplar and daily life, and dutie

Likewise no man or woman shall dare to violate, or breake the Sabboth by any gaming, pub∣lique, or priuate abroad, or at home, but duly sancti∣fie and obserue the same, both himselfe and his fami∣lie, by preparing themselues at home with priuate prayer, that they may bee the better sitted for the publique, according to the commandements of God, and the orders of our Church, as also euery man and woman shal repaire in the morning to the diuine seruice, and Sermons preached vpon the Sa∣both day, and in the afternoon to diuine seruice, and Catechising, vpon paine for the first fault to lose their prouision, and allowance for the whole weeke following, for the second to lose the said allow∣ance, and also to be whipt, and for the third to suffer death. 7 All Preachers or Ministers within this our Co∣lonie, or Colonies, shall in the Forts, where they are resident, after diuine Seruice, duly preach euery Sab∣bath day in the forenoone, and Catechise in the af∣ternoone, and weekely say the diuine seruice, twice euery day, and preach euery Wednesday, likewise e∣uery Minister where he is resident, within the same Fort, or Fortresse, Townes or Towne, shall chuse vn∣to him, foure of the most religious and better dispo∣sed as well to informe of the abuses and neglects of the people in their duties, and seruice to God, as al∣so

ALbeit the zeale which I beare vnto this businesse that we haue all now in hand touching the subsi∣stance of this plantation, might iustly take vp all my
spirits, and would require a large and passionate expla∣nation of mine owne thoughts and promptnesse to gaine & possesse the hearts of all vnderstanding, noble and religious spirits therunto, yet I must craue pardon (considering at this time many present impediments) if I wrap vp any impatient desires & good affection hereunto, to all such vnto whom these necessarie ef∣fects of my dutie and office shall appertaine, and must be declared in few words and aduises, appertinent yet (if not essentiall, as heat to bloud, to the aduancement hereof) my desire then by these is chiefly to let all the worthier & better sort to vnderstand, how well it shall become their Honors, birthes, breedings, reputations & fashes, to do their bests, and emulously to actuate in this worke, the vtmost of their cleerest powers of bo∣dy and mind, where the trauaile of both is so deerely valued, & highly interpreted by al good and wise men, who knowing the grounds of all goodnes, cannot but know this, how this hazardous voyage (as yet but in her earely daies, reflecting onely the comfort of faire hopes) is vndertaken by you, more to honour God, your country, & to profit your knowledges, then for any other ends of profit, which speakes for you (in de∣spight of enuie and calumnie) that you haue mindes much in loue with vertue, & are right noble & worthy instruments, to be imployed in so sacred and heroicke a cause, if it were well knowne heere the care that is had of this plantation in England, and the trauel that is taken therein, and the fire that doth not only burne in the generall body of our deare countrymen, to the encouragemet & ioy one of another amongst them∣selues, but flames out (euen to the view of strange na∣tions, as well our neighbours, as far remote) for the
furtherance & aduancement of this honorable enter∣prise, there is no man here would thinke that this my induction, had either fashion or purpose of a comple∣ment. If the wisest man that euer spake or writ (except him that was both God & man) summed vp all the reckonings of worldly felicities in these two words Laecari & benefacere, imploying a cheereful mirth with well doing (from which it cannot be seuered) who hath more cause to be cheerefull, and inlie glad then you that haue the comfort of so great weldoing, to which no other may be compared? for what weldoing can be greater then to be stocks & authors of a people that shal serue and glorifie God, which is the end of all our Creation, & to redeeme thē from ignorance and infidelity, to the true knowledge and worship of God, whereby you are made partakers of this promise, that they which lead others into Righteousnesse, shal shine like the starres in the sirmament, wherein be right well assured, that your happinesse is enuied by many a right knowing, and excellent vertuous man in England, who cannot happly by reason of other their imployments and callings, bee partakers of that Comfort heere, as they are by their Endeauors there at home. I shall not need to aduise any Colonel, or Gouernor here for the present how to carry himself, for each mans owne ex∣periēce here hath made him out goal vse of my admo∣nitiō, which my affection wold willingly else afford if there were cause. Only to discharge my seruice to god whose souldier I doe now professe my selfe imprest, in this so glorious and great a cause of his, my duty to my Soueraigne Liege Lord and King, & to his High∣nesse my Royall Prince and Master, to my Country
and the expectation of many Honorable select, pain∣ful, and Religious aduenturers, Patrones of this busi∣nesse, I haue conceiued no whit impertinent to deli∣uer and publish to euery imminent officer in this Co∣lony heere present, and for the direction and guiding of such who may heereafter arriue heere such and so many few in structions as may the better inable them to execute their charges, no whit doubting, but euery Colonell, Gouernour Captaine, and other Officer may sufficiētly vnderstand his and their duties, as they are Souldiers, but happily not yet as they are, or may be Coloni, members of a Colony, which compriseth and inuolueth here, as well all the industrious know∣ledges & practises of the husbandman & of his spade, as of the Souldier, and of his Sword, since as Monie is the paiment & wages of the one, so of the other are the fruits of the earth the tillage and manuring of the Land, and in very truth of more necessity & vse shall we heere be of the latter then of the other, whether of you be comprehended the souldier himselfe or his Sa∣larie, since more easie it is to make a Husbandman a Souldier, then a Souldier a husbandman. And indeed the necessity of our subsisting, and the very daunger which our enemies of this Country can any way put vs vnto (our Companies and people well commaun∣ded) requiring the choise rather of the one then the other. These beeing then the ends and intents of this work, and so vnderstood, by euery supreme and chiefe commander, I refer him to these following instru∣ctions. All Gouernors of Town or Towns, Fort or Forts, shall be ready (when so be it they shall be summoned thereunto) to take their Oaths of Allegeance vnto his
Maiesty & of faithfulnes vnto such his maiesties Lief∣tenant or to his Deputy or Deputies (authorised by Commission to command ouer and within the pre∣cncts of this whole Colony, or Colonies, by the Te∣nor of which Oathes they shall solemnly attest to per∣form all Integrity, vprightnesse, Iustice and sincere ad∣ministration of the discipline and Lawes in all causes and cases, for the good of the Colony or Colonies, prouided and declared, and shal indeuor the best they may, with all carefulnesse to aduance the dignity, and subsistance of the same, as well by giuing often in charge, and taking no lesse into their owne care, both the particular preseruation of all such helpes of what condition soeuer (especially of cattell, and al kinde of such breeders, which may efoones redound vnto the vtility and profit of the same, as by tendring the pro∣uisions of the store, and te wel husbanding of the same, be they of what seuerall qualitie soeuer Nor is he meanely to be watchfull, and iealous ouer his own waies and carriage in all particulars, making profes∣sion, and practise of all vertue and godnes for exam∣ple vnto others to imitate, it being true that exam∣ples at all times preuaile farre aboue precepts, men beeing readier to bee led by their eies, then their eare, for seeing a liuely pattern of industry, order and com∣linesse, wee are all of vs rather swayed vnto the same by a visible obiect, then by hearing much more in wel istructd Arguments. Euery such Gouernor therefore shall make it his firit duty to resort dayly and vsully to the diuine Ser∣uice, next to put in execution the Lawes duly against offenders and with all cherish and reward the well de∣seruing, and lastly with all worthines & circumspecti∣on
on, abeare himselfe vnto and towards his Garrison, intreating all men as well strangers as others, with al Grace, humanity, and sweetnes of a noble nature, & manlinesse, vnto all which I hartily aduise, and with∣all inioyne euery such Gouernor of Town or Towns, to be most indulgent, and carefull to performe, as hee will answer the contrary (beside with the losse of his own Honor, with such other penalties, as the neglect of so behoofefull and necessary businesse in him, may draw vpon the Colony. Further he ought to be most vigilant, circumspect, and prouident for the conseruatiō, defending, & kee∣ping the Town or Fort, for & vnto his Maiesty, wher∣in he is placed cheefe commander, & therfore ought the more duely to strengthen his Iudgement, and re∣member his reputation, that he fall into neither of those extreames, which the needy and prodigall are most what culpable of, the one wasting the stocks, commodities and prouisions of the store, by which he must subsist, and the other by being rauenous and corrupt in himselfe become likewise enforced to tol∣lerate the same in his inferior captaines, and so leaue the poore Souldier and Labourer, miserably pilled, oppressed and starued. Further hee ought to prouide that the companies be trained, and that they may bee made ready for the publique seruice, and for that the condition of this country doth require rather shot then other Armes, either for offence or defence, and time being pretious with vs in respect of our dayly labours and works a∣broad belonging to our subsisting, in so much, as a small portion thereof may bee affoorded and allowed vnto such exercising and training, therefore it is ap∣pointed
by the Marshall, that the Captains that shall haue the Guard, during their time of Guard (their people as then being exempted from their dayly la∣bour and work abroad) and their Officers shall teach euery Souldier to handle his peece; first to present it comely, and souldier like, and then to giue fire, by false firing, and so to fall his Piece to the right side with the nose vp, & when their souldiers are hardy and expert in this, they shall set vp a conuenient mark fast by the court of Guard, at which euery Souldier shall twice discharge his peece, at the releeuing of the watch, morning and euening, and he that shall shoot neerest the Gouernor shall do wel to allow some addition of victuals, or pay, or some prize of incouragement, that euery one may therby emulously contend to do best: Concerning the training, and cleanely exercising of their Armes, & their postures, the captains shall haue order and directions for the same vnder the Marshals hand which they shall put in Execution during the time of their Guard. 41 It is also required that the Gouernor neuer lie out of his Towne or Fort whereby hee may the bet∣ter keepe good espiall vpon all officers, that they per∣form their seueral duties each one in his place especi∣ally in good obseruatiō of the watch & Guard, for the more confidēt securing the charge cōmitted to him: Hee shall not suffer in his Garrison any Souldier to enter into Guard, or to bee drawne out into the field without being armed according to the Marshals or∣der, which is, that euery shot shall either be furnished with a quilted coate of Canuas, a headpeece, and a sword, or else with a light Armor, and Bases quilted, with which hee shall be furnished: and euery Targi∣teer
with his Bases to the small of his legge, and his headpeece, sword and pistoll, or Scuppet prouided for that end. And likewisee euery Officer armed as be∣fore, with a firelocke, or Snaphaūse, head-peece, and a Target, onely the Serieant in Garrison shall vse his Halbert, and in field his Snaphaunse and Target. The Gouernour shall haue a Principall care, that he vse his Garrison to the dayly wearing of these Ar∣mors, least in the field, the souldier do finde them the more vncouth strange and troublesome. Lastly the Gouernor shall haue a singular care to put in execution all such Orders and Instructions as shall bee deliuered vnto him from the Generall, or his deputie or deputies, concerning the imployments of his Garrison vpon such manuall works and duties, as shall be thought necessary and conuenient for the better subsisting both of the Laborer, and Garrison committed vnto him▪ In which is not to bee forgot∣ten the chary conseruation of powder, and munition, which will the better inhable him for the defence of his Charge. The Gouernor shall be better instructed by taking notice of the Lawes published, that these following abuses are prouided for, impious and malicious spea∣king against the holy and blessed Trinity, Blasphemy, and taking Gods holy name in vain, traiterous words against his maiesties person, or Royall Authority, vn∣reuerent Demeanor towards the Ministers and prea∣chers of the same, the detestable crime of Sodomie, in∣cest, theft, murther, false witnessing, treason against the Person of the Generall, and principall Com∣maunders of this Colony, and their designes, a∣gainst Detracting, Murmuring or slaundering of the
Right Honorable, the Councell resident in England, and the Committies there, the generall Councel and Subalternate Commanders, heere, as also against in∣temperate raylings & base vnmanly speeches vttered in the disgrace one of another, all which the Marshall Law, as well as the Ciuil Magistrate is to punish, but these which concerne in particular the military Dis∣cipline, to inable your iudgement for your sentence to be required, that it may with greater cleerenes, and vnderstanding, called to censure offences in the Mar∣shal court be deliuered, I haue abstracted, as followeth 1 Conference with the enemy, without leaue or warrant, frō the Lord Generall, Lieuteant Generall, Marshall, or chief & principal cōmand for the presēt. 2 The designes, enterprises, and estate of the Colo∣ny, reuealed to what enemy soeuer, by priuy messen∣gers, or missiues, or otherwise in what sort soeuer. 3 The not present aduertising, & giuing notice vn∣to a chefe Commaunder, of such things as any man knoweth intended any way, or by any body, for the domage, mischiefe or ill of the Colony, or the con∣cealement in any one of any matter of importance, and moment for the good of the Colony. 4 Running vnto the enemy, or intending, and plot∣ting to runne albeit preuented. 5 Of any one taken prisoner by the enemy, hauing meanes to escape, & not returning to the Colony a∣gaine, vnlesse hee haue giuen faith. 6 Of attempting commotion, giuing occasion of sedition, or Muteny in the Colony, or seducing any labourer or souldier from their duty, diuine, ciuill, or martiall, or from their appointed works and labours. 7 Of disclosing or giuing the word vnto the ene∣my,

Instructions of the Marshall for the better inhabling of the Captaine of the watch, to the executing of his charge in this present Colony. the 22. of Iune. 1611. SIthence, as in euery liuing creature, there be many and sundry members, & those distinct in place and office, and all yet vnder the regiment of the soule, and heart, so in euery army, commonwealth, or Colonie (all bodies a like compounded) it cannot be otherwise for the establishment of the same in perfect order and vertue, but that there should be many differing parts, which directed by the chiefe, should helpe to gouerne and administer Iustice vnder him. And if it be thus in this ciuil Audit, & courts of a well setled State, much more sure as it required, to be in their beginnings, and no lesse shall we read, how that first & great comman∣der ouer the Colony of the children of Israel, condu∣cting them from Aegypt to make their plantation in the land of Promise, appointed Captains ouer Tribes and hundreds for the wars, and Elders to sit vpon the bench (whilest vnto himselfe all great causes were brought, whether martial, or ciuil to direct and deter∣mine it otherwise being impossible, so many and infi∣nite occasions both being to be thought vpon, and re∣quiring iudiciall audience, should euer come by one mā (of how indefatigble a spirit soeuer) to be decided or determined. Out of this example cōmended vnto vs by the holy writ, it may wel be, that many Officers are still continued in all vnited societies, religious and wel gouerned: hauing then thus religion, beside prescrip∣tion and reason, (which mine owne breeding hath taught me how to make the best vse of, to be my guids in this new settlement, and in this strange and heathe∣nous
(contending with all the strength and powers of my mind and body, I confesse to make it like our na∣tiue country, I am not a little careful to adhere & take vnto mine owne endeuours, as many furtherances, as may helpe to work out with me the ends of this great imployment, which hath now possessed and furnished all states of Christendom with discourse and expecta∣tiō what may be the issue therof, & to what perfection so great, & frequent leuies of monies, & annuall trans∣portations for these foure yeares of men, and prouisi∣ons, may bring this English plantation vnto: And as I haue constituted subalterne officers according both to the ancient & moderne order of the wars, and well approued the gouernment & magistracy, resembling and maintaining the lawes of England, so I haue taken paines to present so many & such instructions to such speciall officers (whom our necessity teacheth to esta∣blish amongst vs) as may most neerest concerne them for the present, (leauing out yet I confesse many ap∣pertinent ones, which the time & our earely daies here of settlement may not yet admit of. Let me aduise therfore euery officer now established, to hold it a ser∣uice of duty faithfully to execute such orders and in∣structions, as I haue made it my mindes labour to ex∣presse and draw out for him: and amongst the rest (our no little safety consisting in our watch & guard as wel by day as night, we being set down in a stranger land, sauage, and trecherous, and therfore many sodaine and barbarous accidents to be feared, I haue as followeth extracted the duty of the captaine of the wrath an of∣fice not meanly appertaining and necessary vnto this Colony, and whose ignorance, and supine negligence may much indanger the safetie thereof.
That Captaine who is Captaine of the watch, must haue a speciall care of the safeguard and pre∣seruation of the Towne or Fort committed to his charge, and of the liues and goods of the soldiers, and Inhabitants, that through his defect, negli∣gence, or Ignorance in his charge, he giues not oportunity to the enemie to execute any of his deseignes, for the indamaging of the place or the Inhabitants: Now for the more faithfull executing of his charge, he shall doe well to take notice, that being the chiefe commander of the watch, he he is to answere for all Disorders, Misrules, Riots, Tumults and what vnquietnesse soeuer, shall hap∣pen in the Towne or Fort, and that if any of these shall fall out to be, he is to commit the parties so offending, to the Prouost Marshall, making the Gouernour there-with acquainted, that the of∣fender may receiue such punishment, as his fault shall deserue, of what quallity soeuer he be. At the setting of the watch, he is to repayre to the place of Arms, with his Gorget about his neck, if his company haue not the Guard, there to be present with the Sargeant Maior, at the drawing of the Billets for the Guards, that he may the bet∣ter know the strength of his watch, and how the companies are disposed vpon their Guards. He is to remaine from the setting of the watch v∣pon the main court of Guard, or Guard appointed for him & his Rounders that if any occasion pre∣sent it selfe wherin his endeauour is to be vsed, hee may be the readier found to receiue the cheife Offi∣cers direction, or to reforme any abuses that shall
come to his knowledge, by the misdemea∣nors of any to bee found in the campe, towne or fort. The Ports being shut, and the word deliuered out from the Gouernor, he is to see that al his Gen∣tlemen, appointed for his assistants, doe come vpon their guard, where he is so to order it that by draw∣ing of Billets according to their lots, they may ex∣ecute their rounds, whither first, second, third. &c. and after the Corporalls haue set out their centi∣nells, hee is to passe from his court of guard, with three or foure of his assistants, and so to make the round about the campe, towne, or fort, from guard to guard, receiuing from euery Corporal the word of guet, that their be no error, or abuse, by variety of word: after which he is to goe into the court of guard, to see that such officers, rounders, and sol∣diers, apoynted for that guard, bee there present vpon their guard, then hee shall search the peices whither they be charged with Bullet, and that the soldiers bee furnished with poulder and match for the better defence of the guard, committed to his charge, so commanding and inioyning euery offi∣cer, and soldier to execute his duty, for ther better security of the campe, towne, or fort: hee shall de∣part to the next guard there to doe the like, and so from guard to guard, vntill hee hath visited all the guards and centinells of his watch, giuing in charge to the officers of each guard to send forth their rounders, according to their order and di∣rections. Further hee shall command all disordred people
(vntimely sitting vp late in vsuall assemblies, whi∣ther in priuat meetings, publike tap-houses or such like places) vnto their rests, for which he shall cause all fire and candles to bee put out and raked vp in the towne, and such night walkers, or vnruly per∣sons whome hee shall meete in the streets, he shall either send to their lodgings, or to the Prouost Marshall, according as their misdemeanou shall require. Hee being returned to his owne court of guard shall see his rounders set forth euery one accor∣ding to his order of Billet, from houre to houre, and he shall informe him-selfe from these rounders which walke their rounds, two howers before day breake, whither the Captaines and their guards, and their companies bee in armes according to their duties: if they bee not hee shall walke around towards the morning vnto those Guards, and cause them to be put in armes, and shall informe the go∣uernour of those Officers neglects, that they may receiue punishment: after this at the discharge of the watch, hee is with his guard to attend the Serjeant Major for the safe opening of the Ports. At the opening of the Ports, hee shall cause the people to stay that are to goe out of the Towne, a pretty distance from his guard, that they may giue no incombrance to his guard, vntill such time, as he hath sent out certaine Serjeants to discouer forth right, and vpon each side, as farre as the lim∣mits of that fort are prescribed: At the returne of the Serjeant, hee shall cause those of the
Towne to goe out leisurely and without thron∣ging or confusion, and those without to come in, in like manner, warning the Gards to stand in armes one houre after. From thence hee shall returne to the maine Guard or place of armes to assist the Serieant Ma∣ior for the disposing of such men as are appoynted vnto eir seuerall busines and workes of the Co∣lony for the whole day following: and likewise to see that those Captaines, who haue the Guard, do put in execution the cōmandements of the Mar∣shall for the trayning and disciplining of their men for the better inabling them to the seruice of the Colony. After which he shall do well to present himselfe before the Gouernour, or chiefe Officer, to vnder∣stand his further commaunds. It shall bee his duty the time beeing come, when the general morning worke is to be left off, to cause the Drum to beate, and with his Guard of Roun∣ders to assist the Captaines or Capt. to bring the laborers into the Church to heare diuine seruice, which beeing ended hee is to returne to the maine Court of Guard, there to be present for the orde∣ring of all matters whatsoeuer to happen, during his time of being Captaine of the watch, and when it shall so fall out that the Indians do at any time come in way of trade or visitation vnto the Camp, towne or fort, he shal leaue order with the Guards that the suffer not them to enter before such time as they haue made him acquainted first of their beeing there, who shall informe the Gouernor to
know his pleasure, which beeing vnderstood hee shal so accomplish, at al times, appointing Guards vppon such Indians, that they do not steale any of out ooles, Axes, Howes, Swords, Peeces or what thing else; and that none of our people talke pub∣likely or priuately with them, or that they truck or trade with them, or doe any other vnorderly Act, without leaue granted for the same from the Go∣uernour, or chiefe Officer, the omission of which duty, will bee required at his hands. Hee must likewise take notice of all such brea∣ches of the publique Lawes and Articles, as shall bee committed in the time of his Guard, and ac∣cordingly command such persons to the Prouost Marshall, as shall bee found trespassers and brea∣kers of the said Lawes and Articles. At the time or houres appoynted for the after∣noone worke of the Colony, euery labourer to his worke, and euery craftsman to his occupation, Smiths, Ioyners, Carpenters, Brick makers &. He shall cause the drumme to beate againe, to draw and call forth the people vnto their labour, when againe the worke on all hands towards night being to bee left off, hee is to cause the drumme likewise then to beate, and as before assist the Capt: with the whole company to bring them to euening prayer. If it shall so bee that hee bee Capt. of the watch vpon Sonday, it shall be his duety to see that the Saboath be no waies prophaned, by any disorders, gaming, drunkennes, intemperate meeting, or such like, in publike or priuate, in the streetes or within the houses.
It shall be his duty halfe an houre before the di∣uine seruice, morning & euening, to shut the Ports and place Centinels, and the Bell hauing tolled the last time, he shal search all the houses of the towne, to command euery one, of what quality soeuer (the sick and hurt excepted) to repaire to Church, after which he shall accompany all the guards with their armes, (himselfe being last) into the Church, and lay the keyes before the Gouernor. If at any time any alarme be taken, he is to streng∣then himselfe from the maine court of gard, taking a competent proportion of that guard, for the se∣curing of his person, and so to repaire to the place where the alarme was giuen, to enforme himselfe by what means the alarum came, causing his roun∣ders to command all guards to be in armes for the readier execution and resistance of any perill, and conseruation of their charge, and if he find the ala∣rum to be truly giuen, and that the enemy approch the Fort, towne, or campe, he is to send to aduertise the Gouernor or chiefe officers to know his di∣rections for the assembling of guards, and ordering and drawing a force, for the better preuention of the enemies designes. Lastly, when the guard is set, and another Cap∣taine hath the watch, hee shall present himselfe be∣fore the Gouernor or chiefe Commander, to giue account vnto him of all such accidents, trespasses and neglects, as haue beene committed during the time of his watch. Thus to conclude, though his office amongst ma∣ny others be a chief and principall office, and there
be many weighty and frequent duties required in this great duty of the Captaine of the watch, yet these are the most essentiall and necessariest which I can yet aduise, the neerest to concerne vs. Instructions of the Marshall, for the better in∣abling of a Captaine, to the executing of his charge in this present Colonie. Iune the 22. 1611. THat Captaine that will honestly and religiously discharge himselfe, and the duty entrusted to him, shall doe well to conceiue of himselfe, as the maister of a family, who is at all times so to gouerne himselfe, as knowing assuredly that all the crimes and trespasses of his people vnder him shall bee ex∣acted at his hands, not onely by his superior offi∣cer and Iudge here, but by the great Iudge of Iud∣ges, who leaues not vnpunished the sinnes of the people, vpon the Magistrates, in whose hands the power and sword of Iustice and authority is com∣mitted, to restraine them from all delinquences, mis∣deeds and trespasses. And moreouer since the Cap∣taine is to know, that not onely the command of their ciuill duties is at his directions, for which he is to answer, but likewise al their actions and practises which shal breake forth in them, contrary to the di∣uine prescriptions of Piety and Religion: their per∣iuries, blasphemies, prophanenesse, ryots, and what disorders soeuer, and generally all their breaches of both the sacred Tables, diuine, and morrall, to GOD and man, and in this place most espe∣cially, where the worke assumed, hath no other ends
but such as may punctually aduance the glory, and propagation of the heauenly goodnesse, for which so many religious lawes and ordinances are establi∣shed, and declared, all tending to the subsisting of a Colony, the first seed-plot and settlement of such a new temporary kingdom and state, as may reduce, and bring poore misbeleeuing miscreants, to the knowledge of the eternall kingdom of God (there∣fore by him first shut vp in misbeliefe, that in his due time, when it should so please him, hee might againe on them shew mercy) It is carefully there∣fore by each Captaine to be considered, how pre∣tious the life of a poore souldier is, but how much more pretious his soule, and that he make consci∣ence how he expose the first to apparant ruine and mischiefe, or suffer the other to run on into head∣long destruction: for the first let his wisedom, knowledge, and circumspection be euer awake, and ready how to imploy, and when and with what as∣surances, regards and cautions, either left to his owne power, or prescribed him by vertue of these from the Marshall, and for the other, let him first be mindfull to giue witnesses in his owne life, how carefull hee is to please God, who must blesse all that he vndertakes, and walke himselfe in a noble example of Iustice and truth; which doth not one∣ly enforce a reputation and respect from other men, but an imitation and following of the like by other men: And vnto this may the diuerse and frequent changes and strictnesse of the place where we are, and the hardnesse of the many with whom he shal haue to do, with other chances & difficulties
be motiues sufficient to perswade him, in which yet let him remember this, that it is in vaine in such place as heere, to pretend onely to bee vertuous and religious, except a man bee vertuous and reli∣gious indeed, and that vertue extend it selfe to ex∣ample. But since I assure my selfe that of this ad∣uice no Capt. voluntarily imploying himselfe in such a busines as this is, and onely for the businesse sake, hath any need, I commend him to the fol∣lowing instructions. Euery Captaine shall (if conueniently hee may) present himselfe before his Colonel or Gouernor, once a day, to vnderstand his commands, the which hee must bee carefull, neither to exceed at any time, nor bee defectiue in their full accom∣plishment, albeit he shall haue a shew and present∣ment at any time of a better aduantage, since con∣cerning his imployment hee may bee ignorant of the chiefe commaunders ends. Hee shall doe well to haue a speciall eye and re∣gard ouer his company, that they as well brake not the publique Lawes, and Orders pre∣scribed them, but also performe all dueties and seruices vnto which they shall bee for the present commaunded, the which that he may with the bet∣ter aptnesse and conueniency draw them vnto, it shalbe his duty to haue knowledg, and take notice of euery one of his vnder Officers, offices and du∣ties; that he may the readier reforme faults com∣mitted, eyther by negligence, or ignorance, and at the time of watch he shall send his Serieant to the Serieant maior for the word, and if he haue
the watch himselfe, hee shall after the word giuen out, call vpon his court of guard, all his company (vnlesse his Centinels) and assembled together, humbly present themselues on their knees, and by faithfull and zelous prayer vnto almighty God commend themselues and their indeauours to his mercifull protection. After prayer, either the Captaine himselfe, or some one of his vnder officers, shall accompany the Centinell to the place of Guet, after which he shall search all the pieces vpon the court of guard, that they be charged with bullet against the Captaine of the watch or Serjeant Major shall come to visit them, and also that they be furnished with Poulder and Match, for the discharge of their duties, during the time of their watch and ward: and it is his duty, after that the Serjeant Major or Captaine of the watch haue made their round some time after mid∣night to walke his round, to see that his Centinels do hold good watch in their guet, & that all things bee quiet and peaceable, and no disorders in the towne, and that if alarum be giuen, he giue order to his Centinels to take it with al secrecy, without any tumult or noise made, for the act performance whereof, he must haue especiall care that he weaken not his guard, by giuing leaue vnto any of them to be absent from the guard, but vpon iust and lawfull cause, & reason to be alledged: likewise he is to ap∣point certaine gentlemen for rounders in his com∣pany, the which are to make their said rounds from houre to houre, according to the directions of the Captaine of the watch.
Further, about two houres before day, the Cap∣taine shall put on his armes, and cause all his com∣pany to arme themselues, and so to stand in armes vntill one houre after the discharge of the watch in the morning, which time expired, he shall returne with his company vnto the court of guard, and there, with publike praier, giue vnto almighty God humble thankes and praises, for his mercifull and safe protection that night, and commend himselfe and his, to his no lesse mercifull protection and safegard for the day following. And because that, during the watch, that time is appointed for the exercising of his men, and fashi∣oning them to their armes, he shall set vp a conue∣nient marke by his court of guard, where hee shall teach his men the exercise of their armes, both for the comely and needfull vse therof, as the offensiue practise against their enemies, at which marke his men shall discharge their pieces twice, both mor∣nng and euening, at the discharge of the watch, ha∣uing procured from the Gouernor some prize of incouragement due vnto him that shall shoot nee∣rest, then he shall file and ranke, & exercise his men in such military actions, according vnto such forme and exercise, as he shall receiue from the Marshall, not forgetting by the way, that all the Courts of guard, and all the members of the watch and ward, are vnder the command of the Capt. of the watch. Further, the Captaine is to make it his especial du∣ty to haue religious and manly care ouer the poore sick soldiers or labourers vnder his command, for which cause he shall visite such as are sick, and pro∣uide so that they bee attended, their lodgings
kept sweet, and their beds standing the same heigth from the ground which is prouided for in the pub∣lique Iniunctions, as likewise hee shall call for such things for them out of the store, or from the Phisi∣tions or Surgeons chest, as the necessitie of their sicknesse shall require. Further he is to know, because we are not onely to exercise the duty of a Souldier, but of the hus∣bandman, and that in time of the vacancie of our watch and ward wee are not to liue idely, therefore the Captaine sending his Serieant to the Serieant Maior for the word, shall likewise giue in charge vnto his Serjeant to make demand of the Serieant Major, what seruice, worke, and businesse he hath in charge, from the Gouernor, to command him and his men to goe vppon him the next mor∣ning, after notice whereof, he shall so prouide, that he and his men be ready at the relieuing of the mor∣ning watch, the Drum summoning him there-vnto to effect the same, for which he shall bring is men vnto the place of Armes, by the maine Court of guard, where the Serjeant Major, or the Captaine of the watch, shall conduct them to the place of the subsisting businesse, prouiding them such labouring and needfull Instruments or tooles, as the worke for the present shall require, in which worke the Captaine himselfe shall do exceeding worthily to take paines and labour, that his Souldiers seeing his industry and carefulnesse, may with more cheerful∣nesse loue him, and bee incouraged to the perfor∣mance of the like in that businesse wherevpon they are imploied, contrariwise himselfe taking his case,
and inioyning them to toile and worke, may breed both a wearinesse of the businesse in the imployed, and giue a way vnto much hatred, and contempt vnto himselfe. Now concerning the tooles and instruments, and the furnishing his soldiers therewith, the Captaine shall send his Serieant to the store to make demand thereof, and leauing a note vnder his hand for the receipt of the same, thereby charging him-selfe to the redeliuerie of them againe at the finishing of the worke. The companies thus furnished, and be∣ing assembled in the place of armes, the Serieant Maior or Captaine of the watch, vpon their knees shall make their publike and faithfull prayers vnto almighty God for his blessing and protection to attend them in this their businesse the whole day after succeeding, which done the Serieant Maior or Captaine of the watch shal extract out of the com∣panies howsoeuer deuided, and deliuer vnto euery Maister of the worke appointed, his propper and seuerall Ging, to take their wayes therevnto, where the said Maisters and ouer-seers of such workes shal be present with them to labour, and hold to la∣bour such his Ginge vntill 9. or ten of the clock, ac∣cording vnto the coldnesse or heate of the day, at which time he shall not suffer any of his company to be negligent, and idle, or depart from his worke, vntill the Serieant maior, or Capt. of the watch causing the drum to beat shall fetch them in vnto the Church to heare diuine seruice, which beeing effected, euery man shall repaire to his lodging, to prouide himselfe of his dinner, and to ease and rest
himselfe vntill two or three of the clocke in the af∣ter-noone, acording to the heat and coldnesse of the day, at which time the drumme beating, the Capt: shall againe draw forth his company vnto the place of Armes as a foresaid, to bee disposed of as before vppon their worke vntill fiue or six of the clocke, at which time the drumme beating as before, at the command of the Sarjeant maior or Capt. of the watch, they shalbe by one of them brought in againe vnto the Church to Euening prayer, which beeing ended they shall dismisse the company; those that are to set the watch, with charge to prepare their Armes, the others vnto their rests and lodgings. All these duties the Captaine must not be igno∣rant nor negligent to put in execuion, as being duties which will be exactly required at his hands by the Marshall, as also so to behaue himselfe that he may be as well beloued as obeyed of his souldi∣ers, that thereby they may as well know, how to obey, as he to command, and that he endeuour by all meanes to conserue his men, as annoy his ene∣my, & painefully to execute with al diligence such matters as he is inioyned by his superiors, and to haue no apprehension of feare, but of shame and infamie. Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of a Lieftenant to the executing of his charge in this present Colonie Iune the 22. 1611. WHen the Captaine is present he is to be assi∣sting to his Captaine, in prouiding that all directions that are commanded by the Superior
Officer, as well his Captain as other, be put in exe∣cution, that the company be well and orderly go∣uerned, and such duties duly and dayly performed as are inioyned by the Gouernor or cheife officer; and likewise that the duties of the inferiour officers or Soldiers be no lesse diligently and sedulously discharged, for he being, as is said, a helpe, and aide vnto his Captaine, is therefore accountant to and with his Captain for such omissions, disorders and neglects, as the company shalbe found faulty in. He ought faithfully to informe his Capt: of all a∣buses, disorders, neglects, and contempts that shall happen in the company, of what nature or condi∣tion soeuer they bee. If his Captain shal at any time demand his opini∣on in any matter of consequence, he shall faithful∣ly and sincerely deliuer it, but not presume to ad∣uise his Capt. vndemanded, vnles it be vpon extra∣ordinary occasiō of present and imminent perill. It shalbe his duty in all quarrels, braules, debates, and discontentments of his soldiers to accord and agree them without partiallity, and with the least troubling of his Cap. with the same, & if he cannot with his curtesies, and gentle interposition worke them into peaceable agreement, hee shall then acquaint his Captaine, and afterwards faithfully put in execution his Captaines directions. He ought to traine & exercise the company that they may be expert in the vse of their armes when they shall be commanded to publike seruice. He ought likewise to see that the inferiour officers be duly obei'd the one by the other without singu∣larity or contradictiō, & the soldiers obey thē all
in generall, each one according to his place. By his care euery Squadron shal haue his armes seruiceable and cleane, and at the setting of the watch that they be prouided of pouder, match, and bullet, for the defence of the guard, and if the com∣pany be vnfurnished to aduertise his Captaine, or send his Serieant to the munition Maister, that order may bee presently taken for the supplie thereof. Hee shall doe well, if conueniently he may, mor∣ning and euening (or at least once a day) to present him-selfe before his Captaine, to know his com∣mands, and to informe his Captaine, of the state of his Companie. It shalbe his duty to haue care that the compa∣ny bee ready (as is exprest in the Captaines duty) to go forth and attend the daily businesse, and pub∣like labour appertayning to the Colonie, which shalbe comaunded by the chiefe officer, In which hee shall haue a hand in executing, and an eye in ouer-seeing, that euery one take his due paines, and not loyter, and idlely mispend the time appoynted vnto the dispatch of such businesse. Hee is to haue a hearty and religious care that the souldiers doe not make breach of the lawes, and duties, diuine, ciuill, or martiall, inioyned them to obserue vpon so necessary reasons and strict penalties, but that he informe, correct and punish to the vtmost of his authority limited, the trespas∣sers of the same, or the omission of any duty what∣soeuer, with the approbation of his Captaine. Hee is not to make it his least care to ouer-see
and take charge of the lodging and bedding of all in generall in his company, that according vnto the pub∣like edict the preseruation of their healths be prouided for, and that one point of slothfullnesse in the common soldier preuented, and met with, of lying vpon or to neere the ground, which neglect in the officer hath bin the losse of many a man. For his order of command and march in the field, and quartering he shalbe appoynted the manner there∣of by the Marshall, when occasion of seruice shall so re∣quire, like-wise the order of trayning and exercising his Captaines company he shall haue vnder the marshalls hand. Hee is amongst other his duties most carefully, like a charitable and wel instructed Christian, mercifull and compassionate, make often and daily suruey of such of his company as shalbe visited with sicknesse, or wounded by any casualty of warre, gunpoulder, or o∣ther-wise, in which hee shall take such order that the lodgings of such as shalbe so sicke or hurt, be sweet and cleanely kept, them-selues attended and drest, and to the vttermost of his power to procure either from the store, or the Phisition and Surgeons chest, such com∣forts, healps, and remedies, as may be administred and applied vnto them, and to haue care that they be not defrauded of those meanes and remedies which are for them deliuered out of the said store or chests. And for that this officer is in the abscence of his Cap∣taine to be called vnto the Marshall Court as his depu∣tie, for the better inhabling of his iudgement, when his opinion is to be required in the censure of offences and crimes of what quality soeuer, which shalbe brought
thither to be sentenced, I refer him to the abstract of the lawes in breefe anexed vnto the duty of his Capt. Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of an Ensigne to the executing of his charge in this present Colonie, Iune the 22. 1611. IT is requisite for euery soldier to stand vp∣pon his credit and reputation, proposing vnto himselfe that their can be no lesse e∣quall, or to be compared with dishonour, & sure in matters of armes and their execution, what dis∣honour can bee greater then the losse of the ensigne, for which it ought to be committed to the charge of a right valiant, and well gouerned soldier, who may not leaue nor loose it, but where the losse of his life shall quit him of that duty. So farre as toucheth his command, or gouernment in the company, he is to know that he hath no com∣mand where his Captaine or Lieftenant are present, but in their absence I referre him to the duty of the Capt: which he is to execute as religiously, painfully, and circumspectly as the Captaine: he beeing answe∣rable vnto his Captaine for all defects, neglects, disor∣ders, and contempts of duties, in his company what∣soeuer. In the gouernment of his company he is to be asist∣ant vnto his superiour officers, in teaching and ina∣bling all his inferiours, euery one his perticular duty, with faire perswasion and all gentlenes, and sweetnes of command, and if any thing shall happen, either dis∣orders or neglects of duties, it shall be fit for him to
aduertise his superior officers that redresse may be had, for he hath no power of himselfe in their presence to punish, correct, or do any act of executions vpon his companions. When the time of exercise and training shalbe of the companie, he shall be there ready and assistant vnto his superiour officer (if so be it his coulours be not drawne forth) for the better furtherance of him in the so training, and disciplining of the men. Hee shall see all commands of his superior Officers put in execution, and not stand ignorantly in defence (as some haue) and it is the property of the ignorant so to do, that he is tyed to no other duties, but to the car∣rying of his coulours. For no inferiour officers duty, whether Sargeant or corporalls, but he is to performe and execute (if they shall be by any disaster, defeate, or visitation of sicknesse disabled personally to dis∣charge it themselues) being so commanded by his Su∣perior officers, during the time of guard, yea the duty of the Centinell he is to vndergoe, and from which neither the Captaine nor Lieftenant are exempted vp∣on vrgent occasion. In the hapning of any dispute, quarrell, or debate a∣mongst the soldiers, the same being brought to his knowledge, he shall do his best to end and compound, whose authority & perswasions, if they shal not be po∣werfull enough to reconcile & set at one, he shal then informe his Lieftenant, or Captaine: that order with the most speed & conuenience, may be taken therein. He shall hold it his duty to visit the sick or hurt in his company, and to his power of them take the same care, and make the same charitable prouision
for, as is inioynd both the Captaine and Lieftenant. It is his duty to command the Corporalls to bring their squadrons to his lodging, who shal conduct them to his Lieftenant, and they both conduct them to their Captaine, at the beating of the Drum, whither for any manuall labour and worke, for the Colony, or whither to bee lead vnto the Church at any time to heare di∣uine seruice. He is to visit the armes of the Company, and at the setting of the watch to take care, and so at all time, that they be not vnseruiceable, and if any want bee then of mach, poulder, or bullet, or what else defect, hee is to aduertise his Superior Officers, that they may then and at all other times bee supplied and amended. To bee breefe hee is an assistant to the Lieftenant in the same nature that the Lieftenant is to the Cap∣taine, and may not by any meanes intrude into the command of the one or other, they being present. In the absence of the Captaine, and Lieftenant (when hee is then to bee Captaine of the watch) I re∣ferre him to the duty of the sayd Captayne of the watch. For his Order of march, and flying of his collours, and his carriage in the field, and vpon seruice, he shal∣bee ordred and instructed by word of mouth from the Marshall, when occasion shalbe offered. Thus mutch is needfull for him to know touch∣ing his command, and his carriage to his officers and company, so far forth as hee and they are sol∣diers, and as the necessity of this present state and condition which we are in doth require. But con∣cerning the publike and dayly manuall businesse
which appertaine to our setling there as Planters of a Colnie, he is to make it his duty, to be a diligent not onely our-seer, but labourer, himselfe accompanying therein, and seconding the example of his Captaine, and industrious Lieutenant, that the necessary and daily taskes of such workes and husbandry (without which we cannot here keepe footing, nor possibly subsist) may be in due time accomplisht and brought to passe. Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of a Serjeant to the executing of his charge in this pre∣sent Colonie, Iune the 22. 1611. THat Captaine who shall dispose of a Hlbert, by vertue whereof a Serjeant is knowne, ought to make choise of a man well approoued, that hath passed the in∣ferior grades of a resolute spirit, quick apprehension, and actiue body, for it is a place of great paines and promptitude, and that Ser∣jeant who will be able to execute his duty in sinceritie and vprightnesse, must not be slack to punish where it is deserued, nor ouer rash to abuse his authority, vnbe∣fitting an officer of such moment. This officer hath in the absence of his superior offi∣cers the command of the company, to see them doe their duties, and obserue lawes and orders in all things, and punishment of them by his Halbert, or otherwise in his discretion, for defect or negligence in any part of order. This officer is to attend vpon the Serjeant Major for the word vpon the shutting in of the Ports, at the
Gouernors lodging or place of armes, according as the Serjeant Major shall appoint, then he is to giue the word to his Captaine, Lieftenant, and Ensigne, and vn∣to his corporall or corporalls hauing the guard. Hee must see the Soldiers of his company furnished and prouided with munition, as shotte, poulder, and match, at the setting of the watch. Hee is to call, or cause to bee called the Corporalls roule, to see who are absent or negligent in the dis∣charge of their duties. Hee is to see each souldiers armes cleanly kept, and seruiceable, and if default be, he is to reprooue the cor∣porall for his negligence in the ouer-sight of that du∣tie, and to punish the souldier. Hee must see the souldiers practise their armes, and therefore it is requisite that he know the vse of all sorts of armes himselfe. If the watch be set by squadrons, he shall leade that squadron, that is to watch to the Parado, and there draw Billets for his guard, and from thence lead them to the guard. He shall see the setting out of the Centinels, and after shall haue care that silence and good order be kept vp∣on the guard, and that no man depart from the guard without the leaue of him, or his corporall, and that no man be absent aboue one halfe houre, hauing a special regard that hee weaken not his guard, by giuing leaue vnto aboue two at a time to be absent, least he disable himselfe in the performance of that duty of trust and charge which is committed vnto him of the guard. Hee shall see that his corporall or corporals, do put his or their squadrons into armes, two houres before
the relieuing of the watch, who shall so abide in armes, at least one whole houre after. If the watch be set by whole companies, it is his duty to place euery souldier in his order, and to see them march in ranke and file, and himselfe being eldest Serje∣ant to march vpon the right point in the vaunt-guard: if he be the yongest he is to march vpon the left point in the rere-ward, each taking care of halfe of the compa∣ny, vnlesse when more companies march together, they be appointed any other place by a superior officer. When the Serjeant is appointed to lead out any shot, he shall goe vpon the side of the vtmost ranke, and see that they take their leuell, & giue fier, and do all things with comlinesse and leisure, & so likewise in the retrait. A Serjeant of each company, presently after the dis∣charge of the watch shall bee in the place of armes, or market place, to attend the Captaine of the watch to the opening of the Ports, that they may be imploied by him, for the discouery without the forts, of any ambu∣shes or attempts of the enemy, with such guard as hee shall appoint them, the Captaine of the watch hauing caused all those of the towne, about, to go forth, to for∣beare and stay vntill the said Serjeants returne, which Serjeants are to command those that are comming in, to stay vntill those in the towne are comming forth, & then they shal discouer right forth before the Port, and to both sides of the Port, so farre vntill the discoue∣rers of the other forts meete where they end; the discouerers being returned, those of the towne shall be suffered to passe out leisurely, & after those being with∣out shal come in as leisurely, without throng or crowd, that they be the better discerned by the guard what they are. The Ports beeing open, the Serjeants shall
returne to their guards, where they shall instruct their souldiers in the practise of their armes, and shall shew them the ready vse of them, and doe their indeauours by their best meanes, to incourage the towardly, and instruct the ignorant. If vpon his guard, in the absence of his superior offi∣cer, any soldier of his guard shall offend, hee shall ey∣ther punish him by his Halbert, or if the qualitie of the offence so deserue he shall disarme him, and keepe him prisoner vpon the guard, vntill the watch bee releiued, and then hee shall bring him to his superior officers, that he may receiue condigne punishment according to the condition of his offence. The Serjeant ought to know euery souldier, and to take notice of their particular lodgings, and to make it a point of his duty to see that they keepe their lodgings cleane, and that their beds doe stand a yard about the ground, to haue an eye into their diet, their thriftinesse and conuersation, to aduise them to the best, whereof he is to make report vnto the Captaine or chiefe offi∣cer, that they may receiue estimation for good, and punishment for euill behauiour. He is to informe himselfe of the sick, or hurt, in the company, and to visit them once a day, and to inquire whether they bee not defrauded by the Phisitions and Surgeons, of such necessary helpes as are deliuered vn∣to them, for their preseruations and recoueries, and to informe his Captaine of the negligence and abuse of such, who should in that case deale vniustly with them that their dishonesty may receiue due punishment. He is likewise to addresse himselfe vnto the Serjeant Major, and Store-maister, for the supplying of his
company with munition, and victuals, vpon any occa∣sion: and concerning the munition, he is to haue a prin∣cipall care, that the souldier doe not spend it away in vaine, but onely at such times as they are appointed for exercising and training. He is likewise to take notice of all defects and abuses in his company, and to enforme his superiour officers, that they may be redressed, and Iustice take place, He shall with great diligence attend the commands of his Captaine, and of the Serjeant Major, and at all times put them in present execution, rebuking such as doe amisse, shewing them their faults, and teaching them by a good example in himselfe, to tread in the way of all ciuilitie and goodnesse. If any debate shall happen betweene souldier and souldier, hee hauing knowledge thereof, shall doe his indeauor to agree, and reconcile them, that it come not to his superior officers, and if through obstinacie hee cannot agree them, hee shall commit them, or informe his superior officers, who may take order therein. He is to prouide that none of the company bee ab∣sent when the Drum shall call them forth to worke, in which workes he is to be a president himselfe, both by labouring in the same, and calling vpon others to doe the like, He is to goe to the Store, to take out such Tooles, as are required for the workes in hand, and there to vn∣der-write vnto the booke of the store-Maister, or vnto a note to be filed, thereby charging himselfe to be ac∣countable for the said tooles, when the worke shall be performed, ouer which he is to haue a regard, that they be not neglectfully layed vp, spoyled nor broken
without examining by what meanes they came so bro∣ken, that the wilfull breaker thereof may receiue pu∣nishment, and the said toole or tooles so broken, with∣all the pieces, he shall bring vnto the store, to shew the same for his better discharge. Instructions of the Marshall for the better enabling of a Corporall vnto the discharge of his duty in this pre∣sent Colonie, Iune the 22. 1611. THe Corporall is in grade and dignity a∣boue the priuate souldier, and therefore care ought to bee had in the choosing of this officer, for that it is an office of good account, and by neglect of this duty, many inconueniences may come vpon a camp, towne, or fort, therefore it is fit that hee surmount and excell his inferiors in valour, diligence and iudgment, and likewise in the practise and vse of all sorts of armes, whereby he may the better bee enabled to instruct and teach this squadron committed to his charge. The Corporall ought (hauing the third part of the company giuen him in command) to sort and assist them in their quartering or lodging, to haue a care that they be cleane and sweet, and that their beds in the same bee laide three foote from the ground, hee is to carry a hand ouer their dye, thriftinesse, and conuer∣sation, and to aduise and instruct them at all times to demeane themselues as good Christians ought to do, and to make report thereof vnto his Captaine or chiefe officer, that from them they may receiue credit
and estimation for good behauiour, and punishment and disgrace for their misdemenours. Hee is to haue a speciall care of their Armes to see them duly furnished and kept in order, and when the Drum beateth to bee in a readinesse at the Colonies; and if any bee absent, hee shall make it knowne to his Serjeant or superior officer. When he marcheth, hee is to lead a file, hee ought to bee daily conuersant with his little company com∣mitted vnto his charge, and the company beeing in the field, to lodge with them, and prouide to his power for their wants, and to instruct and teach them how to vse and handle the weapon they carry: Likewise, to remember well how each one is armed and appoin∣ted when hee receiueth him into charge, then to see no part of his furniture or armes bee broken or spoi∣led, but to haue care that they bee preserued cleane and seruice-able. Hee ought to haue a vigilant eye vpon the good behauiour of his company, not suffering them to vse any vnlawfull and prohibited games, nor that they giue them selues to excesse of drinking, surfitting and ryot, but that they bee conformable to all the Martiall lawes: that they likewise make spare of their pay or victuals, the better to furnish themselues in comely and decent manner, with apparell and other necessaries fitte and requisite for them, wherein the Corporall ought to vse his vtmost endeauour. In presence of his Captaine, or superior officer, hee is to take vppon him no more then the conditi∣on of his office doth require, but diligently to at∣tend and execute what they shall command, that his
example may serue for a President to the rest of his squadron. At the setting of the watch hee is to see that they be furnished with poulder, Bullet and match, and that their armes be seruiceable and soldier-like. If the company watch by squadrons, he and his squa∣dron shall be brought by the Serjeant vnto the place of watch, and from him receiue the word and directions, in what maner, and where he shall place his Centinels, whether by day or night which hee is to see per∣formed. When the Corporall with his squadron shall bee brought to the place where he and they shall watch, he and they must prouide eft-soones for wood for fyring vpon the guard, that beside for their owne comfort, they may haue fire ready alwayes vpon the guarde to light their match vpon any proffered occasion. Hee is to cause silence to bee kept vppon the court of guard, and to gouerne the watch, so that the labour bee equally diuided of his squadron, either in watch, worke, or seruice, and to take care in all respects, that they performe the duties of good and honest soldiers. His Centinels being placed, hee is to let none passe without the word, vnlesse it bee the Captaine of the watch, or Serjeant Major, vnto whom (after hee shall haue perfect knowledge of them,) hee is to deliuer the word at their first round, but before the deliuery of the word, hee shall take the Captaine of the watch and Serjeant Major alone within his guard, the corporall beeing accompanied with halfe a dozen of shot with Match in Cock, to haue an eye ouer the rest of the rounders that accompany the Captaine of the watch
or Sarjeant Major, and not to suffer the rounders to come within the centinell, & if at any time of the night after their first round, the Serjeant Maior or Captaine of the watch shall goe their round, as it is their duties, then they are to giue the word to the Corporal, vnlesse they mistrust the doubt the memory of any Corporall: the Corporall is not to goe out single to take the word of any round but to take two, or three, or more of his guard with him, and if it shalbe a round of more then two, then hee shall w out all his men in his guard in their armes, the Corporall shall at no time (to receiue the word) passe beyond the Centinell, but make him that hath the word to come forward within the Centinell, and shall cause the rest to stand without the Centinell, and those that are out by the Corporall for his guard shall keepe their eies and armes in a rea∣dinesse ouer him that is to giue or take the word of the Corporall, vntill such time as the Corporall be satisfi∣ed of him. He must make good his guard vntill he bee releiued the which hee shall the better doe if hee keepe his men together vpon the guard; he must visite the Centinels sometimes vnawares to them, and must be ready to go to them at the first call. Hee shall put his men in armes two houres before the discharge of the watch, so to remayne one houre after. Hee shall warne his Centinells to make noe alarum but vpon iust cause, and then with as much silence as may be, and in like silence hee must aduertise the Cap∣taine of the watch, and the next guards vnto him, and so without notice or signe of contusiō from one guard
vnto an other. If vpon his guard any of his soldiers shal misdemeane himselfe, or offend in any of the publique lawes, diuine, ciuill, or martiall, he shall bring him to his superior of∣ficer, then vpon the guard, that he may receiue punish∣ment. His duty is to prouide that none of his Squadron, be absent, when the drumme shall call to any labour, or worke, or at what time soeuer they shall be com∣manded there vnto for t eruice of the Collonie, in the performance of which said workes he is to be an example of the rest of his Squadron by his owne labouring therein, and by encouraging and calling vpon others at any time negligent, idle and slothfull, that thereby giuing encoraging to his supe∣rior officers he may be held by them worthy of a high∣er place. Hee must likewise receiue such instruments and tooles, as spades, shouels, axes, &c. imployed in the worke, from his Sarjeant to dispose, and to deliuer the same vnto the labourers with all the care he may, to his vtmost, that none of them be broken, lost, or wilfully spoiled, without drawing the parties so brea∣king, loosing and wilfully spoyling the same into punishment; and after the worke done he shall ga∣ther the said tooles in againe and re-deliuer them vp vnto his Sargeant, all, and the same, who is to be accountable vnto the maister of the store vnto whose booke he hath vnderwritten for the receipt of them. And by reason he is well knowing of euery man
in his Squadron, and thereby cannot but misse the pretence of any man from any duty whatsoeuer, sooner then haply the superiour officers may, his care shall bee to attend his squadron to the vsuall workes and day-labours, and vnto frequent pray∣ers, and the deuine seruice at all times, and vp∣pon all the dayes in the weeke, giuing due notice vnto his superiour officer, of the neglect of ey∣ther duties in their kinde hat reformation may follow. Hee shall not suffer any gaming, heare any prophane lewd speeches, swearing, brawling, &c. or see any disorder whatsoeuer vppon his court of guard, or else-where, without present in∣formation giuen thereof vnto his superiour officer, that the offenders may bee duly puni∣shed. Hee shall take notice of all bands and procla∣mations published by the Generall, procuring a copie of the same from the Prouost Marshall, the same duly to bee read vnto his squadron, that they may bee made the perfecter in the know∣ledge of them, and thereby learne the better to forbeare the trespassing in forbidden things, re∣membring the penaltie of the same, and execute things commanded, considering the reward there∣of, whether in Campe, Towne or Forte, Field or garrison. Hee shall read, or cause to bee read, the Souldiers dutye, euery time of his guarde in some conuenient time and place, during
the same, thereby to remember them the better of their generall duties. Instructions of the Marshall for the better en∣abling of a priuat soldier, to the executing of his duty in this present Colonie. Iune 22. 1611. IT is requisite that he who will enter in∣to this function of a soldier, that he de∣dicate himselfe wholly for the planting and establishing of true religion, the honour of his Prince, the safety of his country, and to learne the art which he prosesseth, which is in this place to hold warre, and the seruice requisite to the subsisting of a colonie: There be many men of meane descent, who haue this way attained to great dignity, credit, and honor. Hauing thus dedicated himselfe with a constant resolution, he ought to be diligent, carefull, vigi∣lant and obedient, and principaly to haue the feare of God, and his honor in greatest esteeme. In making choyse of his familiar accquaintance, let him haue care that they be of religious and ho∣nest conditions, not factious nor mutenous mur∣murers, nor euill languaged and worse disposed persons: his choyse beeing made he is to carry him selfe discreete, temperate, quiet and friendly, with∣holding himselfe from being to lauish of speech, for such as take liberty vnto themselues to talke li∣centiously, to slander, raile, and backbite others, do vsually make bankrout of their friends, of esti∣mation, and of their owne peace and quiet of conscience.
He must be carefull to serue God priuately and pub∣liquely; for all professions are therevnto tied, that carry hope with them to prosper, and none more highly then the souldier, for hee is euer in the mouth of death, and certainly hee that is thus religiously armed, fighteth more confidently and with greater courage, and is thereby protected through manifold dangers, and otherwise vnpreuentable euents. He must bee no blasphemer nor swearer, for such an one is contemptible to God and the world, and shall be assured to be found out and punished by the diuine Iustice: whereof we haue instant examples. He must refraine from dicing, carding, and Idle ga∣ming: for common gamsters, although they may haue many good parts in them, yet commonly they are not esteemed according to their better qualities, but cen∣sured according to their worst, procuring enemies, questions, brawles, and a thousand following incon∣ueniences. He must not set his minde ouer-greedily vpon his belly, and continuall feeding, but rest himselfe conten∣ted with such prouisions as may bee conueniently pro∣uided, his owne labour purchase, or his meanes reach vnto: aboue all things he must eschew that detestable vice of drunkennesse; for then a man is not apt nor good for any thing, and by that beastly disorder, many great armies haue miscarried, and much disquiet and tumults raised in campe, and ciuill townes, wherevpon doth fail the sword of Iustice vpon their necks, which in that case they haue compelled to be drawne. Chastitie is a vertue much commended in a souldi∣er, when vncleanesse doth defile both body and soule,
and makes a man stinke in the nostrils of God & man, and laieth him open to the malice & sword of his ene∣my, for commonly it makes a man effeminate, coward∣ly, lasie, and full of diseases, & surely such who haue vn∣lawful women stil trudging about with thē, or in whom custome hath taken away the sence of offending in that kind, commonly come to dishonorable ends. He is tyed in his entring or inrowling into any com∣pany, to take his oath of faithfulnesse, and sincere ser∣uice to his Prince, Generall and Captaine: to be con∣formable to the lawes prouided for the aduancement of the intended businesse, and for the cherishing of the good therein, and punishment of the euill. He must be true-hearted to his Capt. and obey him and the rest of the officers of the Campe, Towne, or Fort, with great respect, for by the very oath which he taketh hee doth binde himselfe and promise to serue his Prince, and obey his officers: for the true order of warre is fitly resembled to true religion ordeined of God, which bindeth the souldier to obserue iustice, loyaltie, faith, constancie, patience, silence, and aboue all, obedience, through the which is easily obteined the perfection in armes, and is as a meanes to atchieue great enterprises, though neuer so difficult: certainly, who wanteth the vertue of obedience and patience, though neuer so valiant otherwise, yet is he vnworthy of the same name. A souldier must patiently suffer the aduersities and trauailes which do fall out in the courses and chances of warre: he must not be ouer-greedy, nor hasty of his pay, albeit he may stand in some want thereof, but must with a chearfull alacrity shew his constancy, auoyding
by al possible meanes, rebellions and mutenies, which most vpon such pettish occasiones are runne into: by no meanes must hee bee a pertaker with such mutiners, for the end of such is sharpe and shamefull death. If in Skirmishes Incounters, or surprise of towne the enimies be vanquished, let him set all his care and dili∣gence in execution of the victorie with his Armes, & not in rifling and spoiling for trash, for so he shal be ac∣counted an vnruly freebooter, beside innumerable are the disorders and mischefes which do happen by raue∣nous Pillagers, many times to the dishoner of the acti∣on, and to the losse of their liues, therfore he shall pur∣sue the victorie vntil the enimy be wholy ended & the place fully caried and possessed, the Guards placed, and liberty granted from the chiefe Commander to sack & spoile, wherein by any meanes let him auoid murther and crueltie, and violation of women, for those are odious to God and man, rather in such cases let him shew himselfe pittiful and mercifull vnto the van∣quished, rather defending the sillie women and Chil∣dren then procuring their hurt and damage, for in so doing it will be right acceptable to God and his Com∣manders. Such Armes as he is apointed to serue with, whither Musket, Caliuer or Target, let him be very dilligent to vse all his industrie to excell in the vse of them, for therby he may conserue his owne life and his fellows, for the which purpose he shall call vpon his Serjeant and his Corporall to instruct him therein, vntill hee come vnto perfection. He must learne the seuerall sounds of the Drumme,
whereby hee may obey that which he is commanded; for the Drum often-times is the voice of the Comman∣der, hee shall carefully note and marke the signes made by the Captaine and officers, without talking or prat∣ling vnto his next companions: for that is vnbesitting a Souldier, and makes him vncapable to heare what is giuen in command. In skirmishes and incounters he shal be resolute and valiant, for that souldier which is timorous and fearfull can neuer bring his heart to any hearty enterprise, nor dareth to attempt any hotte, bold, or audacious charge or seruice, by reason of his cowardly spirit and feare. Hee must bee carefull to bee alwayes vigilant and ready, beeing placed for a Centinell, or in the Court of guard, where he shall not put of his armes, vntill hee haue leaue from the Captaine: for therein consisteth the security of the Campe, Towne, or Fort. Hee shall doe well to keepe his fidelity vnspotted to his Prince and Generall, although his sufferings may bee intolerable and infinite, and shall not flye vnto the enemy: for to bee branded with infamie of a traytor is a fowle and odious offence, and rigourously punished among all nations, and neuer yet traitor came to good end; of which we haue examples infinite. Hee must not bee shifting from company to com∣pany, but serue in the company where hee first began, and if at any time hee shall depart for his preferment, let him demand the good liking of his Captaine, who if hee shall denie it him in such a case, it shall bee imputed no offence in him to appeale vnto the Gene∣rall or chiefe officer.
At the sound of the Drumme, for the setting of the watch with his arms being fix and seruiceable he shall repaire to his colours, and it shall be commendable in him by the way to call vpon his Corporall, so that all the Squadron meeting together at the Corporals lod∣ging may attend the Corporall vnto the colours, and if he be vnprouided of munition he shall acquaint his Corporall therewith, who shall see him furnished. When the company or squadron march to the guard he shall hold that order in which he was placed by his Serjeant, marching in a comely and gracefull manner, and being armed at the place of guard he shall pose his armes according vnto the Corporalls direction, and behaue himselfe in all his actions as befitting a religi∣ous Soldier in that holy place of guard, without doing any act of prophanesse, disorder, or ought els, tending to the pollution of the same either in word or deed. When his Corporall shall appoint him forth for Centinell, he shall shoulder his peice, both ends of his match being alight, and his peice charged, and pined, and bullets in his mouth, there to stand with a carefull and waking eye, vntill such time as his Corporall shall relieue him, and to let no man passe nor come vp to him, but to force him stand, and then to call his Cor∣porall. He must harken diligently and looke well about him from his place of Centinell for the approch of a∣ny about the Camp, Towne, or Fort, or the dich there∣of, or if he heare any noyse, to call his Corporall to ad∣uertise him of the same. He must haue a speciall care that he sleepe not vpon his Centinell, nor set his armes out of his hands: for
therein he maketh himselfe subiect for any passenger by to take away his life, beside the generall inconueni∣ence that may come vpon the Camp, Towne or Fort. His Corporall hauing releiued him and brought him to the guard, he shall do well to read the Lawes and or∣dinances for the gouernment of the Camp, Towne, or Fort, constituted and prescribed by the Marshall, the better to enable his memory for the exact obser∣uance of those lawes whereby he shall not only auoyd the trespassing against the same, but also get the repu∣tation of a well ordered and gouerned soldier. Such gentlemen or others, as are appointed by their Captaine for rounders, and approoued by the Serje∣ant Major or Captaine of the watch, amongst them those rounders that are appointed to attend the Cap∣taine of the watch on his guard are to receiue their di∣rections from him, as Likewise those of the companies vpon the guards for their order of rounding, according to the time of the night in what hower they shal make their Rounds, The Rounders from the guard, from the Captaine of the watch, are to visit the Centinells, and Courts of guards, making their rounds vpon the rampart, hark∣ning and listening and looking ouer into the ditches, if they can heare or see, or discouer any troopes, or men neere the town, taking care besides that there be good watch kept both by the Centinells, and vpon the court of guard, and if any noyse or tumult be neere the ram∣part, they may step downe and informe themselues of it, and bring the trespassers to the next guard, commit∣ting them there vntill after the round made they haue acquainted the Capt. of the watch of such disorders.
The rounds frō the Ports are to round the streets to take in charge that no disorders, breaking vp, or fiering of houses of yc store, or roberies, magazin, riots or tumult in Taphouses, or in the streetes, or in priuat houses at houres vntimely be committed, and the offenders to bring to the next guard, and to informe the Captaine of the watch; All rounders are to be subiect and obedi∣ent vnto the Captaine of the watch and his commands during his time of watch. Two houres before day he must be ready in arms with his peice charged & prouided, & a match a light at both ends and bullets in mouth, there to attend the com∣mand of the Corporall vntill further directions be gi∣uen, and at the time appoynted for the exercise of his armes, he shall be tractable and obedient to his officers executing such commands as they shall impose vpon him, that he may be the better trained and inhabled to offend his enemy, and to defend himselfe. He shal be carefull to obserue al words of command, postures and actions, according to the order of trai∣ning published by the marshall. The exercise being ended and the prisewon and lost he shall pose his armes at the court of Guard, and ther giue diligent atendance that he be at no time absent from his Guard, aboue one houre, without leaue from his Officer, and that not without leaue of his Officer. The watch being relieued and he free from the guard he is to dispose of the rest of the time for his owne perticular vse vntill next morning at the discharge of the watch: when at the call of the drumme, he shall attend at his corporalls lodging ther to receiue such instrument, or toole as the busines
of that day shall require, from whence he shall march to the place of armes or maine court of guard; there to be disposed of by the captaine of the watch for that day seruice of the Colonies, in which he shall doe his best indeauour like a painfull and industrious seruant of the Colonies to discharge his duty for the furtherance of his worke, and incouragment of such who shall be the more stirred vp by his example of goodnes, to the imi∣tation of the like: and thus doing, he shall giue cause vnto the Generall, vnto his Captaine, and chiefe offi∣cers, to take notice of his painfulnesse, who may accor∣ding to his desert in time giue him aduancement for the same. He shall continue at his worke vntill the drumme beate, and that his Captaine, his officers or ouerseers of the worke, giue order unto a cessation for the time, and for the same purpose attendeth to lead him in, whom he shall orderly and comely follow into the Camp, Towne or Fort, by his said Captaine, officer or ouerseer him meeting, to be conducted vnto the church to heare diuine seruice, after which he may repayre to his house or lodging to prepare for his dinner, and to repose him vntill the drumme shall call him forth a∣gaine in the afternoone, when so (as before) he shall a∣company his chiefe officer vnto the field, or where els the work lieth, and there to follow his easie taske vntill againe the drumme beat to returne home: at which time according as in the forenoone, he shall follow his cheife officer vnto the church to heare diuine seruice and after dispose of himselfe as he shall best please, and as his owne businesse shall require; with this caution carefully to preserue the toole or Instrument with
which he wrought to serue his turne againe the next day as he will answere the contrary vpon the perill prescribed Concerning his order of march and carriage in the field when occasion shall present it selfe, he will easily acquire and learne the same by experience, prouided that he be carefull to march, ranke, and file, and not straggle, or be disobedient vnto proclama∣tions of the General for therin consisteth the princi∣cipall part of his duty, vntill when I leaue him with this caueat, that he diligently marke, consider and re∣member the orders, which the higher officers do ob∣serue, in ordering their files and rankes, and suruey∣ing their squadrons of footmen, and to the placing of the great Artillery in the march and setled campe, and the plot of the quartering, according to the dis∣position of the ground where the campe shall then be, with the manner of entrenching, placing of Ordi∣nances & Guards for the defence of the same, that in the knowledge and execution of these duties, the Ge∣nerall hauing vnderstanding of his promptitude and diligence may conferre vpon him, and call him vnto place of preferment and commaund. That there be no neglect found in him, in his mar∣ching to the Guard or Field, and that in the same he doe not forget or leaue behinde him any peece or parcell of his Armes appointed him by the Marshall for his owne defence, or offence of the enemie.
A Praier duly said Morning and Eue¦ning vpon the Court of Guard, either by the Captaine of the watch himselfe, or by some one of his principall officers. MErciful Father, and Lord of heauen and earth, we come before thy presence to worship thée in calling vpon thy name, and giuing thankes vnto thée, and though our duties and our verie neces∣sities call vs héereunto: Yet we con∣fesse our hearts to be so dull and vntoward, that vnlesse thou be mercifull to vs to teach vs how to pray, we shall not please thée, nor profit our selues in these duties. Wée therefore most humbly beséech thée to raise vp our hearts with thy good spirit, and so to dispose vs to praier, that with true seruencie of heart, féeling of our wants, humblenesse of minde, and faith in thy gracious promi∣ses, we may present our suites acceptably vnto thée by our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. And thou our Father of al mercies, that hast called vs vnto thée, heare vs and pitie thy p0re seruants, we haue indéed sinned wonderously against thée through our blind∣nesse of mind, prophanesse of spirit, hardnesse of heart, selfe loue, worldlinesse, carnall lusts, hypocrisie, pride, vanitie, vnthankfulnesse, infidelitie, and other our na∣tiue corruptions, which being bred in vs, and with vs, haue defiled vs euen from the wombe, and vnto this day, and haue broken out as plague sores into innumerable transgressions of all thy holy lawes, (the good waies whereof we haue wilfully declines) & haue many times displeased thée, and our own consciences in chusing those things which thou hast most iustly & seuerely forbidden vs. And besides all this wee haue outstood the gracious time and manes of our conuersion, or at least not stooped and humbled our selues before thée, as wee ought, al∣though we haue wanted none of those helpes, which thou vouchsafest vnto thy wandering children to fetch them
home withall, for we haue had together with thy glori∣ous workes, thy word calling vpon vs without, and thy spirit within, and haue béene solicited by promises, by threatnings, by blessings, by chastisings, & by examples, on all hands: And yet our corrupted spirits cannot be∣come wise before thée, to humble themselues, and to take héede as we ought, and wish to do. Wherefore O Lord God, we do acknowledge thy pa∣tience to haue béene infinite and incomparable, in that thou hast béen able to hold thy hands frō reuenging thy self vpō vs thus long, & yet pleasest to hold open the doze of grace, that we might come in vnto thée and be saued. And now O blessed Lord God, we are desirous to come vnto thée, how wretched soeuer in our selues, yea our ve∣ry wretchednesse sends vs vnto thée: vnto thée with whō the fatherlesse, and he that hath no helper findeth mer¦cy, we come to thée in thy Sons name not daring to come in our owne: In his name that came for vs, we come to thée, in his diation whom thou hast sent: In him O Father, in whom thou hast professed thy selfe to be well pleased, we come vnto thée, and doe most humbly beséech thée to pittie vs, & to saue vs for thy mercies sake in him. O Lord our God our sins haue not outbidden that bloud of thy holy Son which speaks for our pardon, nor can they be so infinite, as thou art in thy mercies, & our hearts (O God thou séest them,) our hearts are desirous to haue peace with thée, and war with our lusts, and wish that they could melt before thée, and be dissolued into godly mourning for all that filth that hath gone through them. and defiled them. And our desires are now to serue and please thee, and our purposes to endeuour it more faithfully. we pray thée therefore for the Lord Iesus sake seale by in our consciences thy gracious pardon of all our sinnes past, and giue vs to féele the consolation of this grace shed abroad in our hearts for our eternall comfort and saluation: and that we may know this perswasion to be of thy spirit, and not of carnall presumption, (bles∣sed God) let those graces of thy spirit, which doe accom∣pany
saluation, be powred out more plentifully vpon vs, encrease in vs all godly knowledge, faith, patience, tem∣perance, méekenesse, wisedome, godlinesse, loue to thy Saints and seruice, zeale of thy glory, iudgement to dis∣cerne the difference of good & ill, and things present which are temporary, and things to come which are eternall Make vs yet at the last wise-hearted to lay vp our trea∣sure in heauen, and so set our affections more vpon things that are aboue, where Christ sits at thy right hand: And let all the vaine and transitory inticements of this poore life, appeare vnto vs as they are, that our hearts may no more be intangled and bewitched with the loue of them. O Lord, O God, our God, thou hast dearely bought vs for thine owne selfe, giue vs so honest hearts as may be glad to éelt the possession of thine owne. And be thou so gracious, as yet to take them vp, though we haue des∣perately held thée out of them in times past, and dwell in vs, and raigne in vs by thy spirit, that we may be sure to raigne with thée in thy glorious kingdome, according to thy promise through him that hath purchased that inhe∣ritance for all that trust in him. And seeing thou doest so promise these graces to vs, as that thou requirest our industrie and diligence in the vse of such meanes as serue thereto (good Lord) let vs not so crosse our praiers for grace, as not to séeke that by di∣ligence, which we make shew to séeke by prayer, least our owne waied condemne vs of hypocrisie. Stirre vs vp therefore (O Lord) to the frequent vse of prayer, to reading, hearing, and meditating of thy holy word, teach vs to profit by the conuersation of thy people, and to be profitable in our owne, make vs wise to apprehend all oportunities of doing or receiuing spirituall good, streng∣then vs with grace to obserue our hearts and waies, to containe them in good order, or to reduce them quickly, let vs neuer thinke any company so good as thine, nor a∣ny time so well spent, as that which is in thy seruice, and beautifying of thine Image in our selues or others.
Particularly we pray thée open our eies to sée our na∣turall infirmities, and to discouer the aduantages which Satan gets thereby. And giue vs care to striue most, where we are most assaulted and endamaged. And thou O God, that hast promised to blesse thine owne ordinances, blesse all things vnto vs, that we may grow in grace & in knowledge, and so may shine as light in this darke world, giuing good example to all men, and may in our time lie downe in peace of a good conscience, embaulmed with a good report, and may leaue thy bles∣sings entailed vnto ours after vs for an inheritance. These O Father, are our speciall suits, wherein wee beséech thee to set forth the wonderful riches of thy grace towards vs, as for this life, and the things thereof, we craue them of thée so farre as may be for our good, and thy glory, beséeching thée to prouide for vs as vnto this day in mercy. And when thou wilt humble or exalt vs, gouerne vs so long, and so farre in all conditions and changes, as we may cleane fast vnto thee our God vn∣changeably, esteeming thée our portion, & sufficiēt inheri∣tance for euermore. Now what graces we craue for our selues, which are here before thy presence, we humbly begge for all those that belong vnto vs, and that by du∣tie or promise wee owe our praiers vnto, beséeching thée to be as gracious vnto them, as vnto our own souls, and specially to such of them, as in respect of any present affliction or temptation may be in speciall néede of some more spéedie helpe or comfort from thy mighty hand. Yea our Lord God we humbly desire to blesse with our praiers the whole Church more specially our nation, and therein the kings Maiestie our Soueraigne, his Quéene and royall seede, with all that be in authoritie vnder him, beséeching thée to follow him and them with those blessings of thy protectiō and direction, which may preserue them safe from the malice of the world, and of Satan, and may yeeld them in their great places faith∣full to thée for the good of thy people, and their owne eter∣nall happinesse and honour.
We beséech thee to furnish the Churches with faith∣full and fruitfull ministers, and to blesse their liues and labours for those mercifull vses, to which thou hast or∣dained them, sanctifie thy people O God, and let them not deceiue themselues with a formalitie of religion in¦stéed of the power thereof, giue them grace to profit both by those fauours, and by those chasticements which thou hast sent successiuely or miredly amongst them. And Lord represse that rage of sinne, and prophanesse in all Christian states whh bréeds so much Apostacy and de∣fection, threatning the taking away of this light from them: Confound thou O God all the counsel and practi∣ses of Satan and his ministers, which are or shall be ta∣ken vp against thée, and the kingdome of thy deare sonne. And call in the Iewes together with the fulnesse of the gentiles, that thy name may be glorious in al the world, the daies of iniquity may come to an end, and we with all thine elect people may come to sée thy face in glorie, and be filled with the light thereof for euermore. And now O Lord of mercie, O Father of the spirits of all flesh, looke in mercie vpon the Gentiles, who yet know thée not, O gracious God be mercifull to vs, and blesse vs, and not vs alone, but let thy waies be knowne vpon earth, & thy sauing health amongst all nations: we praise thée, and we blesse thée: But let the people praiss thée O God, yea let all the people praise thée, and let these ends of the world remember themselues and turne to thée the God of their saluation. And séeing thou hast ho∣noured vs to choose vs out to heare thy name vnto the Gentiles: we therefore beséech thee to blesse vs, and this our plantation, which we and our nation haue begun in thy feare, & for thy glory. We know O Lord, we haue the diuel & all the gates of hel against vs, but if thou O Lord be on our side, we care not who be against vs. O therfore vouchsafe to be our God, & let vs be a part and portion of thy plople, cōfirme thy cauenāt of grace & mercy with vs, which thou hast made to thy Church in Christ Iesus. And seeing Lord the highest end of our plantation here, is to
set vp the standard, & display the banner of Iesus Christ, euē here where satans throne is Lord, let our labor be blessed in laboring the conuersiō of the heathē. And because thou vsest not to work such mighty works by vnholy means, Lord san∣ctifie our spirits, & giue vs holy harts, that so we may be thy instrumēts in this most glorious work: lord inspire our souls with thy grace, kindle in vs zeale of thy glory: fill our harts with thy feare, & our tongues with thy praise, furnish vs all from the highest to the lowest with all gifts & graces néedful not onely for our saluation, but for the discharge of our du∣ties in our seuerall places, adorne vs with the garments of Iustice, mercy, loue, pitie, faithfulnesse, humility, & all ver∣tues, & teach vs to abhor all vice, that our lights may so shine before these heathen, that they may sée our good works, & so be brought to glorifie thée our heauenly Father. And seeing Lord we professe our selues thy seruants, & are about thy worke, Lord blesse vs, arme vs against difficulties, strength vs against all base thoughts & temptations, that may make vs looke backe againe. And séeing by thy motion & work in our harts, we haue left our warme nests at home, & put our liues into our hands principally to honour thy name, & ad∣uance the kingdome of thy son, Lord giue vs leaue to com∣mit our liues into thy hands: let thy Angels be about vs, & let vs be as Angels of God sent to this people. And so blesse vs Lord, & so prosper all our procéedings, that the heathen may neuer say vnto vs, where is now your God: Their I∣dols are not so good as siluer & gold, but lead & copper, & the works of their own hands. But thou Iehouah art our God, & we are ye works of thy hands: O then let Dagon fall before thy Arke, let Satan be confounded at thy presence, & let the heathen sée it & be ashamed, that they may séeke thy face, for their God is not as our God, thēselues being Iudges. Arise therfore O Lord, & let thine enemies be scattered, & let them that hate thée lie before thée: As the smoke vanisheth, so let Satan & his delusions come to nought & as war melteth be∣fore the fire, so let wickednes, superstitiō, ignorance & idola∣try perish at ye presēce of thée our God. And wheras we haue by vndertaking this plantatiō vndergone the reproofs of the
base world, insomuch as many of our owne brethren laugh vs to scorne, O Lord we pray thée fortiffe vs against this temptation: let Sanballat, & Tobias, Papists & players, & such other Amonits & Horonits the scum  dregs of the earth, let thē morke such as helpe to build vp the wals of Ierusalem, and they that be filthy, let thē be filthy still, & let such swine still wallow in their mire, but let not ye rod of the wicked sal vpō the lot of the righteous, let not them put forth their hands to such vanity, but let them that feare thée, reioyce & be glad in thée, & let them know, that it is thou O Lord, that raignest in England, & vnto the ends of the world. And séeing this work must néeds expose vs to many miseries, & dangers of soule & bodie, by land & sea. O Lord we earnestly beseech thee to receiue vs into thy fauour & protection, descr vs from the delusions of the diuel, the malice of the heathē, the inuasions of our enemies, & mutinies & dissentions of our own people, knit our hearts altogether in faith & feare of thee, & loue one to another giue vs patience, wisedome & constancy to goe on through all difficulties & temptations, til this blessed work be accomplished, for the honour of thy name, & glory of the Gospel of Iesus Christ: That when the heathē do know thée to be their God, and Iesus Christ to be their saluation, they may say, blessed be the king & Prince of England, & blessed be the English nation, and blessed for euer be the most high God, possessor of heauen & earth▪ that sent them amongst vs: And heere O Lord we do vpon the knees of our harts offer thee the sacrifice of praise & thanksgiuing, for that thou hast moued our harts to vndertake the performance of this bles∣sed work, with the hazard of our person and the hearts of so many hundreds of our nation to assist it with meanes & pro∣uision, and with their holy praiers, Lord looke mercifully v∣pon them all, and for that portion of their substance which they willingly offer for thy honour & seruice in this action, recompence it to them and theirs, and reward it seuen fold into their bosomes with better blessings: Lord blesse Eng∣land our sweet natiue countrey, saue it from Popery, this land scour heathenisme, & both from Atheisme. And Lord heate their praiers for vs, and vs for them, and Christ Iesus our glorious Mediator for vs all. Amen.
