Kinsale the 16/29 of Septemb. 1642. Brother BENJAMIN WHEE, MY last w and 26 past, which we ry sad, and ther∣fore make no repeatail, only a touch of the necessity of the Fort of Doncannon, if it be not speedily releived, The Rebels are in great numbers continu∣ally round about it, & questionles do thirst much after it, Waxford have set forth 5 or 6 men of War, one of them carrieth 18 Pieces of Ordnance, and it is reported they have lately taken 5 or 6 English Barques, so that all those parts, Duncannon excepted, is as secure unto them, as the River and County of Limbrick; It were good service for some of our Ships to destroy the Herring fishing of Waxford and Rilbeggs. I will now with much joy and thankfullnesse of heart relate, to Gods glory, the great and wonderful work he hath late∣ly done among us. The last day of August came the
Lord Inchequeens command to our Governour, requiring him to send away all the Force he could possibly make, foot and horse, and that he should rise and march away presently; the like was done in Youghall and Bandonbirdge, the first present they marched from hence, the second they all met at their Randevouz neer about Don∣nerayle and the third day for ever to be remember∣ed, very timely they marched to Liscarrell Castle, which Muscry the day before had taken, and was then there with h frces encamped about 8000 fighting men and seven hundred horse, the best of the  Province, our forces not passing seventeen hundred horse and foot: the Enemy were full fed, ours had scarce bread in their Knapsacks; theirs healthy strong and lusty, ours for the most part weak and sick, not able to endure the weight of a Musquet, and for certain, many upon the march had perished in the ditches, had not some of our horsemen taken them up be∣hind them and carried them to the place where they must make a stand; The Enemy had the Castle of Liscarrell to friend, three pieces of Ord∣nance, whereof one of them weighed neer 8000. weight, mounted in a convenient Battery, half Moons and Breast-works drawn with much ingenuity; on the other side a very great Bogg to secure them, in sine, they had so far what they de∣sired and to naturall reason what nature could af∣ford, ours for the most part a naked People. The Onset was given by a few horse of this Town and Bandon, and a little too timely, they had not
any of them so much as a head-piece, onely my Lord of Kinealmakie that was cloathed with Ar∣mour of proof, were enforced to retreat, in which my Lord onely was shot, and not a man of the rest touched; It was Gods great mercy that this so timely Onset had not wrought untimely ef∣fects, by encouraging the Enemy and disheart∣ning of us: But our mayne Body coming up, and so well ordered, the horse led by my Lord of Inchequeen, and the foot by Sir Charls Vavasour, who went in the head of them, and with good language and reasons did so encourage them, as every man cryed Victory before they had given fire; Captain Chidley behaved himselt with singular valour and discretion: Sergeant Major Story is much honoured for his valiant Actions. The Lord Inchequeen was once far engaged and in some danger, but relieved by Captain Gibson, and at that time slew one of their great Champi∣ons called Oliver Steevens with his owne hand, The Onset being given by our Horse, and the Bat∣tell began by the Muskettiers, being in number about 400, continued for a time somthing doubt∣full, the Irish making hideous noyses, and stood to it very valiantly; their Ordnance at first stroke a terrour, but God so directed the businesse, that they went over and did us no harm; our sick were recovered, felt no more weaknesse nor infirmity, but stood to it like brave men, God gave them hearts according to the goodnesse of their cause; and after an hour and a half, or thereabouts, the Friers and the Priests faith failed them, that they ran away, Generall Barry was easily perswaded to go with them; the Lord of Muscry took his leave with a plain Complement, That he had done what he could, and did hope another time to have better successe; it is imagined he had recei∣ved a shot, abundance of the prime Gentlemen were slain upon the place, the rest fled, and accor∣ding to their wonted custome, betook themselves to Woods and Bogs; our Horse pursued them as far as it was convenient: Two hundred that were in the Castle, and might have kept out 5000, ran with the rest, the like did those that were with the Ordnance in the Battery, Colonell But∣ler, and divers other Commanders taken priso∣ners: Of the Rebells were slain at least 700, and above a thousand more dangerously wounded: Our people brought away five or six hundred Muskets, three Pieces of Brasse Ord∣nance, which were taken out of the Castle of. Lymbricke, five Barrells of Powder: it is thought the Friers carryed the rest of the Powder with them; the Fields were covered with Pikes, which our people regarded not: Captain Cooper, with a Company of men, was appointed to keep the Castle, and the three Pieces of Ordnance brought to Mallow, supposed they shall be brought to Cork.
This was the great work of the Almighty, for of our side were not passing four or five men slain, and five or six wounded, which in short time may recover: Colonell Butler that was taken prisoner, confesseth that they knew of our coming to them at least 24 hours before, which was almost as soon as the businesse was conceived, And that they made nothing of us; his comparison was no more, then if ten men armed compleatly, should encounter with two naked horse-boyes, And that their intent was from this Castle, to have gone to Donnerayle and Mallowe, which in their conceits would scarce have hindred them an hours march; From thence to Cork and Bandon; and from this place to have diiven us all into the Sea: And in∣deed, as the case stood wi h us, what they intend∣ed might have been easily brought to passe, what by the desease amongst our souldiers, want of pay and cloaths, the difference that was grown in Bandon between the Lord of Kinelmeakie and the Inhabitants, and to naturall reason our going thither with such a handfull of weake men to give them Battle, so many in number, so well Armed, and so strongly scituated, had been to abandon our Garrisons and to hasten our own destruction; But as I have said it was the finger of God onely that did direct us, that his power & providence in his own cause might be the more clearly discerned by us: They had all taken the Sacrament to fight it out to the last man, and it is credibly reported that the Fryars had given many of them Charms to keep them shot-free. One passage more I may not omitt, how it
pleased God to confound them in their own pol∣licy, they did possesse the Common People that all the Common Souldiers and English of these parts were all sick and dead, and that there were not passing three or four hundred living, and that it was but staying eight or ten dayes till they should have the possession of all the Towns with∣out striking a blow; but when they saw our peo∣ple approaching neer, and not able to discerne what number we might be, which seemed very great unto them, and seeing us marching still to∣wards them, that the former Informations stroke such a terror in them, that they all cryed out, Are these the three or four hundred men living? and thereupon flung down their Arms and ran away, so in every thing it is plain the Lord was our de∣liverer, we shall now I hope in few dayes be able to gather some relief for our Towns. A Gentleman, one Master Hasset, that was a pri∣soner with them, understanding very well the Irish Tongue, saith he heard them talk a day or two before this Battell, that the Lord Harbes and his Fleet were at Galway, and with the help of the Fort, had taken in that Town; which I believe to be true.
We are now at the 19 Ditto. The above is Co∣py of a former, which I coufirm in each particu∣lar, since our Army hath not stirred in any busi∣nesse of consequence, neither have we heard of any thing done by the Rebels hereabouts; neither can we learn of any new head made by them to attempt any thing suddenly, Sir Charles Vavasour is cone to garrison with two or three companies in Bandon bridge, Captaine Chidley is with him, they were with me about three dayes past, and by Gods blessing they will be now a meanes to repaire the breaches of dis∣order which were in that Towne, and bee a great securing to us in all these parts, we labour now to some purpose to bring in what harvest wee can; it is much better with us then wee expected, it is Gods great mercy and favour towards us. Inclosed I send you an examination taken of a Merchant and Master from Bilvoa, the contents a∣gree with a copie of a Letter sent me by Master Authory Stowell, which hee saith was presented to the Committee, and by them to be sent to the se∣verall ports in these parts now in obedience, which I have done, the Letter was written by George Pasmore in St. Sabastians to Humphry Tocker in Exon. and it agreeth in the substance with the ex∣amination. Yesterday came into this Port one Captaine Erowne of Plimouth from the westerne parts, repor∣teth my Lord Forkes was at Galloway, and ordered all things well in that Towne, (as he thought) and from thence came to the river of Lymbrick, and that before hee could doe any thing there, Newes was brought him that Golloway was againe revolted, whereupon he returned againe thither
with all his forces, and that in this progresse some of his fleet had taken a vessell that came from the coast of Byscay, laden with powder, ordinance, musket-barrels, and other armes, and my hope is it is true. I hope the Admirall Kettleby is by this brought to answere his leaving this coast when it was in most necessity. I have furnished the castle of Castle-haven by the Lord Inchequeenes entreaty, with two pieces, ordi∣nance, carriages, shot, and all things compleat, and three barrells of powder, which were be∣longing to the ship Charles. Likewise by my Lord of Barrimeres command, I have delivered foure pieces ordinance, and all ap∣purtenances for the fortifying of this castle Lyons, which hath been long threatned, and often as∣saulted by the enemy. I hope in time I shall have satisfaction for all, if all things goe well, if other∣wise, both our selves and our estates must goe to∣gether, my confidence is God will bee further glorified by us. Yours the 24th of August came lately to hand, and take notice how neere your condition is broughr to ours, it was alwayes my opinion they were twins. I sent you an account of my disbursements in his Majesties service to that day, which I am con∣fident you have received, but answer nothing un∣to it, at which I marvell, but I shall expect it by
yours next, and hope that honourable assembly will speedily order you satisfaction. If William Slaughter of Crook-haven bee with you, put him in minde to petition for his horses and armes, Captaine Kettleby keeps a horse of mine with his, very unworthily, and but by some such meanes wee shall never have any recompence. forget not the solicitation of Pelilong it is all the earthly meanes I depend on in Recompence of my losses, and for the future maintenance of my poore distressed family. This is what for the pre∣sent I remember, the Lord of heaven keepe and protect you and us from the evill is dayly threat∣ned, if we beg and pray aright we shall prevaile. Your loving Brother, Trestram Whetcombe.
Depositions of William Lake, Master of the Hope-well of Foye, burden 60 Tuns, taken before Tristram Whercombe, Maior of Kin∣sale, upon Oath, Sept. 6. 1642. THis Examinate being duely sworn, upon the holy Evangelist, saith inter∣alia, That about eight dayes past he came forth from Bilvoa in Biskey, in compa∣ny of seven other Vessels, belonging to seve∣rall Ports in England; And that in July last, he, this Examinate was at Nants, where he saw, and did often converse with severall Irish Merchants belonging to Gallaway, Blabes, and Brownes, who seemed to be ve∣ry plentifull in Monies, and bought a French Ship belonging to Oldron, burden 120 Tuns, or thereabouts, 12 Pieces of Ordnance, and presently after began to take aboard Ammu∣nition of all sorts, the certain quantity he knoweth not; but as far as their estates
would stretch they employed, and gave forth, That they intended to proceed a man of War to take English, and that of as many as they could take, not a man should escape with his life; and that they should not ex∣pect any quarter at all. And further saith, That within few dayes after this Vessel was bought and divulged abroad, there came in∣to the Town 3 or 400 Irish from Paris and other places, amongst which were divers Priests and Friars to this Deponents know∣ledge, and so many of them went aboard the said Vessell as she could conveniently carry; but, the certain quantitie of Ammunition, number of persons, or place where they were bound, he knoweth not. He further, deposeth, That one Stephen Linch of Galaway Merchant, but of late yeers hath resided in Bilvoa, having a Veslell of about 60 Tuns, lying in S. Sabastians about two Months past, began to load her with Powder and Ammunition; the certain quan∣titie of Powder he had provided, was five hundred Barrells, 40 or 50 Pieces of small Ordnance, Musket-Barrells, and Rapier
Blades: Which intention and practice com∣ing to the notice of English Merchants there resident, in a generall way they petitioned to the Governour make search and stay of what should be found aboard, or in his pos∣session; whereupon the Governour, instead of giving a favourable answer, commanded all the said English to be imprisoned, and imposed heavy Fines upon them; and for sa∣tisfaction of the said Pines, caused their Cel∣lers and Ware-houses to be broken open, and seized and sold the goods therein, untill the uttermost penny of the said Fines were sa∣tisfied; in which sales the said goods were much under-valued, to the great dammage of the said Merchants: And presently after the said petition and punishment, the Irish, with the Governours approbation, not one∣ly ordered the said Vessell, but Linch and his adherents bought another Vessell of 50 Tuns, and sent both to a neer adjoyning Creek cal∣led Muttrico, where they both finished their ladings.
This Deponent further saith, That he was credibly informed by some English Marri∣ners that were present, and saw when two Lighter-loads of Chests packed with Mus∣ket Barrells, and Rapier Blades, were put aboard the said Vessells; and that they were both full laden, and ready to sail a Month past; and as he was informed, they did de∣part that Coast about 18 dayes past, bound for Galaway: the said Stephen Linch Imbar∣qued himself, and had in both Ships about 60 Sea-men all Irish. This Deponent likewise saith, That be∣sides the Ammunition (as he was credibly informed) these Vessells have aboard at least twelve thousand pounds Starling, in ready Coyn, which was gathered there in the Countrey: and that every Irish man there resident, did strive, and was very forward to adventure the uttermost penny of his Estate in this Catholike Cause, and did boast in their common discourse, what they had and would do. And being de∣manded what passengers came in the said Vessells, saith, They had aboard many pas∣sengers, but one of them of speciall note,
called by the name of Oneale, which had beene bred, and brought up in Spayne, and further he rememembreth not. Richard May Merchant came in the above sayd ves∣ssell, from Bilbvoa, and confirmed the above things in each particular. Tristram Whetcomb Soffraigne. FINIS.
