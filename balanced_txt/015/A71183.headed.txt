A TABLE To all the EPISTLES and GOSPELS IN THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER. SO That you may find any of them, when named by the MINISTER, though you know not what Sunday it is. AND ALSO What Texts of Scripture are quo∣ted, being contained in them. To be found in an Alphabetical manner. This Table may put in your Common Prayer Book, without new binding, be∣ing so small a thing. London, Printed for Sam. Keble, at the Turks-Head in Fleet-street, over against Fetter-lane. 1690.
To the READER. I Think it may be convenient to give some Account  the Ʋsefulness of this Table, to the Epistles and G¦spels in the Book of Common-Prayer. The first is  them that have not so good a memory as to remem what Sunday it is; so that when they come to Chur, they know not how to find the Epistles or Gospels  pointed for the day. As for Example; The Minister always says,  begins such an Epistle (not naming what Sunday it is) taken out of the 13th Chapter of the Roma beginning at the 8th. Verse. Now cast your Eye  this Table looking for R. for the 13th. of the Roma and the 8th. Verse; and you will find it to be the  Sunday in Advent; and so any other in the like manner. The Second is to find any Text of Scripture conta in them, as when a Text is taken out of the New ∣stament it is very probably it may be found in eith the Epistle or Gospel, which is very convenient f them that have not a Bible with them. The Third thing is the Method it is Printed in, ∣ing divided into four Columes: The first is the  of the Books of the New Testament: The second is the Chapters: The third the Verses: The fourth is the Sundays and Holidays. All which being put i  Alphabetical manner for finding any thing in the Table with much ease. This Table may be put in your Common-Prayer  without new binding, being so small a thing.
