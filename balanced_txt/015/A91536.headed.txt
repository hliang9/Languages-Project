UNTO HIS GRACE, THE EARL OF MARCHMONT LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER OF SCOTLAND And the Right Honourable ESTATES OF PARLIAMENT The PETITION of HENRY PAYNE, Humbly Sheweth, THAT where your Petitioner a Stranger, being apprehended Eight Years ago and upwards, hath been ever since detained Prisoner, and the greatest part of the time closs Prisoner; whereby his privat Affairs and Fortune are not only ruined: But likewise his Health is so weaken∣ed and impared, That if he continue in this Miserable Condition, he cannot have a prospect to live long: And your Petitioner having applyed to the last Session of Parliament for a Remedy to his Sufferings, they were graciously pleased to ordain, That an Address might be made to His Majesty, that some course might be taken for his Relief; which hath never as yet had any effect, but your Peti∣tioner still continues under great Hardship and Misery in the Castle of Stirling. It is therefore humbly craved, That His Grace the Commissioner, and honourable Estates of Parliament, will so far Compassionat the Miserable Condition of a poor Gentleman, (who is a Stranger) as either to allow him to depart this Kingdom upon his enacting himself to Banishment, and that a time may be pre∣fixed for that effect, or else some other Course taken for his Deliverance out of this miserable state, under which he hath groaned so many Years: And that a Sum of Money may be ordained to be payed him for relieving him of the Debts he has contracted; which are very considerable, by reason of his long Imprison∣ment, and almost continual Sickness: And that in the mean time, he may be brought to Edinburgh, in order to prepare for his Transportation out of this Countrey. And Your Petitioner shall ever pray.
