❧ By the King. ❧ A Proclamation concerning the bringing in of Whale-finnes into his Maiesties Dominions, &c. AS Wee conceiue, it cannot be construed by any Our doings or procee∣dings, that Wee are caried with any ambitious or vniust appetite, to couet that which appertaineth to others: So it shalbe alwayes Our desire and resolution, to nourish and maintaine the happy estate of Our louing Subiects, and the ho∣nour of Our Kingdomes; not onely in the same degree, in the which we haue re∣ceiued them; but likewise with that increase and aduancement, whereof the pro∣uidence of Almighty God by iust occasions shal put meanes and opportunities into Our hands; and in nothing more (next vnto the true worship of God, and the administration of Iustice) then in the main∣tenance and increase of Nauigation, wherein Our kingdomes both by scituation, strength of shipping, skill of Narriners, valew of Commanders at Sea, and many honourable discoueries and exploits, haue for long time, and more and more of late time flourished. And whereas Our Company of Mer∣chants for the discouery of new Trades, commonly called the Muscouia Company, haue with their great costs and charges, of late yceres discouered a Land, which they call by the name of King Iames his New∣land, to the increase of Nauigation and Mariners, and haue further by their care and industry entred into a trade of fishing for the Whale, and procured Biscainers, skilfull in striking the Whale, teach and In∣struct the English Nation therein: And whereas a principall part of the beuefit of the Whale-fishing con∣sisteth in the commoditie of Whale-finnes, imported into Our Kingdomes; And that experience already sheweth, that Our owne subiects in their returne from that Fishing, are able to furnish and serue Our Kingdomes with sufficient quantity for the vse of Our louing subiects: it being also a matter of delira∣cie, & rather to be considered as it may concerne Nauigation, then in it selfe: We haue therfore thought fit for the better encouragement of the said Company, and other Our Subiects, in seruices of like na∣ture, to Prohibite all Aliens and strangers, and also Our owne subiects, (except the saith Muscouia Mer∣chanks, & that in their ioynt stocke) to bring hereafter into any Our Kingdomes the said commodity. Wherefore we do by these presents, straitly and expresly forbid and prohibite, all Aliens and stran∣gers whatsoeuer, and also all Our owne Subiects (others then the said Muscouia Merchants, and that in their ioynt stocke) to bring into any Our kingdomes, and Dominions any Whale-finnes, vpon paine of Confiscation of the same, and of Our high indignation and displeasure, and of such further punish∣ment, as shalbe meet to be inflicted vpon the offenders for their contempt in that behalfe: And We do further hereby charge and require all Our Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers & other Officers, and also the Farmors of Our Customes, and their ministers, carefully to attend euery one in their se∣uerall dueties, the execution of this Our Royall Proclamation, and in no wise to permit or suffer any Whale-finnes, either directly or indirectly, openly or priuately, to be brought into the Ports, or other pla∣ces of any of Our kingdomes: And in case any be brought in, the same to seaze to Our vse, and by all other meanes to finde out, and informe of all offences tending to the breach of this Our Royall Pro∣clamation. Giuen at Wansted the eleuenth day of September, in the twelfth yeere of Our Raigne of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland. 1614. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie ANNO DOM. 1614
