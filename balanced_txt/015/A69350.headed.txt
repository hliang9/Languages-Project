❧ By the King. ¶ Orders for thorow-Posts, and Curriers, riding in Post in Our Affaires. THe lords of the Priuie Councell endeauoring heretofore the like furtherance of the Seruice of the State, aswell in horsing such as ride on their Princes Affaires, as the speedie dispatch of Packets in all places, where Postes were erected and ordeined, considering, that for the seruice of the one, a daily Fee is allowed, and for the other no certaine wages at all, but the hire of the Horses let out, and that often ill payed, whereby they stand not so bound to the one, as to attend the other: And that the Townes and Countreys besides became many wayes vexed and perplexed, by the ouer great liberty of riders in Poste, especially by such as pretend publike Seruice by speciall Commission, contrary to the Kings meaning, or their Lordships Orders: Who minding no∣thing more, then the particular good of his Seruants and subjects; for the benefite of the one, reliefe of the other, and more regard to the good vsage of all Owners of Horses, and the beastes themselues, did thinke it expedient, to digest and set downe sundry necessary Orders indifferent for all parties to obserue and follow, Which Orders being by vs reuiewed and considered, are now according to the ne∣cessity of the times, thought meete to bee estsoones allowed and published. The execution whereof, we seriously recom∣mending to the Master and Comptroller of all Our Postes, for the better warranting and directing of Postes, so farre as this Seruice may concerne them, Wee doe hereby straitly charge and command, all and euery Lieutenants of Shires, deputy Lieutenants, Iustices of al Assises and Peace, Sheriffes, Mayors, Bailiffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other his Officers, Ministers, & louing subjects, to be aiding and assisting to the same, with their vtmost helpe, authority and countenance where need shall require, as they tender the furtherance of the seruice of the State, and our displeasure. 1. FIrst it is ordered, That in all places where Postes are laid for the Packet, they also as persons most fit, shall haue the benefit and preheminence of letting, furnishing & appointing of Horses to all riding in Poste, (that is to say) with Horne and guide by Commission or other wise, And to that end shall keepe, and entertaine of their owne, or haue in a readinesse vnder their direction, such and so many able and sufficient Post-horses, with conuenient furniture, as their owne abilities will beare, or that the contributorie prouision of the Townes and Countreys shall enable them vnto, or afford. And if it fall out that Curriers or Thorow-Posts, riding in our Affaires by speciall Commission, come so thicke, or in such numbers, that their ordinary prouision will not suffice, then the Constables of the places where they dwell, with the assistance of the chiefe Magistrates there, and of the countreys adioyning, (being required in our name) shal take vy, bring in, and supply the Postes with horses where they may be had or hired. 2 ANd like as in the Orders for the carying of the Packets, the furtherance of our seruice and the State is only ay∣med at, so in this it is intended, that none be holden to ride on publike affaires, but with speciall Commission, & the same signed either by one of our principall Secretaries of State, or sixe at the least of our Priuy Councell, or the Master and Comptroller generall of the Postes, for all iourneys outwards, and from the Court onely. And to the Court, the Lords of the Priuy Councell of Scotland, any Lieutenant, Deputy of Gouernors in Ireland, the Presidents of Councels, or Vicepresidents established in the North, or in the Marches of Walles, the Gouernor of Barwiche, Any Am∣bassadour, Gouernours of Townes, or Agents beyond the Seas, The Warden of the Cinque Ports, or his Lieutenant of Douer, specially sending to the Court, to the body of the Councell, or Secretaries of State, or any Pachet so directed, that it may appeare, the party dispatched there with, rideth in our special Affaires, (the Ambassadors of forreine Princes with∣in this our Realme, and the ordinary Posts for France and Flanders allowed, and by their badges sufficiently commissio∣nated, excepted) and of all such so riding in publique Affaires, it shall be lawfull for the Postes, or the owners of the Hor∣ses to demand for the hire of each Horse after the rate of two pence halfepeny the mile, (besides the Guides groats.) But of all others riding Poste with Horne and Guide, about their priuate businesses, the hire and prices are lest to the parties discretions to agree and compound within themselues. 3. IT shall not be lawful for any person whatsoeuer riding in Post by Commission or other wise, to take and ride away the Horse or Horses of any man, Poste or other, not hauing first or aforehand fully payd and satisfied for the price and hire vnto the Owners or the Post for them, nor ride them further then the next immediate Stage without changing, without the knowledge and consent of the Poste of the Stage, by whom he rideth in Poste, nor charge any Horse so taken to ride in Post with any Male, or burden, (besides his Rider) that exceedeth the weight of thirty pounds: Neither shall any man so riding in Post, offer to ride any mans Horse aboue seuen miles the houre in Summer, viz. From the first of Aprill, till the last of September; nor aboue sixe in Winter, which shall be accounted the rest of the yeere: And if any shall wilfully disobey herein, or in any point hereof to the manifest hurt or hinderance of the Horse his Owner, The Officers and Magistrates of the place vpon complaint made, shall stay the parties offending vntill they haue giuen present satisfaction, or sufficient securitie to repay the damage. FInally, as it is onely intended that our seruice in this kind, be at all hands furthered, and the Posts to that end, in all their wants and wrongs to right themselues by the help and authority of the Magistrates, Townes & Coun∣treys as abouesaid: So if the seruice shall seeme vnto any Post a burden ouergreat for his priuate state to beare and vndertake, and the Townes and Countreys (notwithstanding the ease and quiet they reape thereby) no way wil∣ling to countenance, encourage or enable him thereto: or otherwise in regard of yeres or indisposition, shal not see reason to vnderlie the charge and trouble of the seruice, as being a hinderance to his speciall duety in the seruice of the Packet: The Poste in such case attending his peculiar charge, the Constables and Magistrates of the places shall take order from time to time, that Horses be prouided for all riding in Poste by Commission, or specially sent in our Affaires as beforesaid, in such fort as they were subject to do before there were any Posts there, and as in places where are yet no standing Posts at all. Vnto whom also our pleasure is, that these Orders shall be in force, and auaileable (being deliuered them from the Master and Comptroller of the Posts) so farre as they, and any branch of them may concerne the furtherance of pub∣like seruice, or their owne reliefe. Signed by his Maiestie, and subscribed by Charles Stanhop Knight of the Bath, Lord Stanhop of Harington, Master and Comptroller generall of his Highnesse Postes. God saue the King. ¶ Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton and Iohn Bill, Printers to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. ANNO 1621.
