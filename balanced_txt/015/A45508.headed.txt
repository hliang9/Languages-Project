The happy INSTRUMENTS of ENGLANDS Preservation. Come and behold ye salvation of ye Lord. HEAVEN SHALL TURN THY WEAPONS AGAINST THEE The wrath of God is uoon all those that conspire against his Church. My testimony full triumphs Godfres murder did undoe The knot of all yse plotting Crew. Why should Stafford so deny What he knew as well as I Living dying still the same Rome will nere forget my name This Crown they aimd at but the host of Heaven protects it. By our discoverys you may know What damn'd Intreagues are hatcht below The INFERNALL CONCLAVE How shall we destroy thesese Hereticks Go on and Prosper yuou Holyness is sure of me. It must be by a general Massacre. Exit Visct Stafford. Behold th'Infernall Conclave, mett in state, Contriving Englands and its Monarchs Fate.

And thus to Oates and all the rest wee owe The Kingdoms Peace, if wee can keep it so. London Printed for Ben: Combe at the hall and Anchor in Lombard street.
