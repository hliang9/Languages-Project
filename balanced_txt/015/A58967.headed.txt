A Sad, Amazing and Dreadful RELATION OF A Farmer's Wife, NEAR WALLINGFORD in Barkshire, WHO Abusing her Husband, for Selling Corn cheap to the POOR, and wishing, The Devil might Thrash, the next Day found him Thrash∣ing, &c. MAny things at first view may seem to Mankind so strange and amazing, as to doubt or stagger his Belief, but then when they seriously deliberate and find thing as strange very often as undeniably verified, they must admire the wonderful Order of Providence, in acting and disposing of things below in such a manner as passeth our understanding, and this extends either to Mercy, in favouring, feeding and protecting Mankind against Dangers, or in Punish∣ment,
in bringing on him Want, Misery and Pu∣nishment, by Temptations or other grievous ays, as our Sins and Repinings draw upon us,  when God has given us Plenty and we shut up ur Bowels of Compassion to the Poor, that are  want, then Blasts and Mildews often fall upon ur Corn and Fruits of the Earth, because God, ho gives all increase, is dishonoured, by our ovetousness and Ingratitude; so that evil Spirits e sometimes made his Ministers of Vengeance in undry kinds to wreck their Fury, as will sadly ppear in the following dreadful Relation, which as of late occasioned so much Discourse in divers arts of this Kingdom, being, for the strangeness f it, without parallel: But, not to detain you from the Subject-matter, It so happen'd of late, That a Rich Farmer whom God had blessed with plentiful Crops of of Corn for some Years past, living near Walling∣ford, in the County of Bucks; so that having his arns full stored, and hearing the Markets grew canty, and the Price was much raised, (to the reat Grief and Pining of the Poor in these hard Times, when Work it self is scarce, and Money ven by that not easily to be come by, for the upplying the craving Necessities of a Family in a ear Year) he opened several Mows that had not efore been touched and thrashed great quantities, which he sold in the neighbouring Markets and
o several Mealmen, who came to buy it at the arn floor, thereby getting great Rates, by which means he gained considerable Sums of Money more han he expected: But he one Evening coming rom Market, and giving his Wife an Account of is Day's Marketting, and how he had sold, she being always severe in Exacting, which, it seems, or quietness sake he usually did; or, as some say, he bng such a Shrew, he durst not do otherwise, he baing all the Rule, she found by the Money he had not given her a true Account, and to concluded he had undersold, and forcd him to a freer confession; which was, That he had opened some Sacks and sold to the Poor, that were very necessitous and flocked thither in great Numbers, some with Tears in their Eyes, at lower Rates▪ as being moved to compassion at their declaring their Necessities and Inabilities to support themselves and their Children, bidding her be patient and expect God's Blessing to make it up manifold. Upon this she fell into a passionate Rage, railing at him in a grievous manner, calling him Fool and Sot, and that he ought to consider his own Interest before that of a parcel of Whores and Rogues, and their Bastards, being a lazy Pack, who minded not so much to work, as to increase the Charge of Parishes, and to eat up what she and others la∣boured for, &c.
The good Man endeavoured to pacifie her, by putting her in mind, that they had plenty and so felt not the wants of the Poor, and since such a Mercy was extended to them, it was but reason for his sake who had blessed their Endeavours, and given it them, that they should do some good in their Generation. But this not at all moving her to pity, she grew more outragious, saying, None had helped her to the worth of a Penny, but what she had gotten by rising early and sitting up late; and she was beholden to none, as she knew of for a Earthing. He upon this pleading the goodness of Providence, to shew her her error, she grew more enraged, calling him Sot and Fool, swearing she would have her will▪ and seeing the Rains fell very much and the Harvest like, or at least, as most who are for Self-interest pretend, to be bad, she resolved, that no more should be thrashed, but she would have it kept for dearer Markets, which she said, she foresaw would soon grow to a great rate, by reason of the Rains. So that by this we may see what God sends as a general Good, is often laid hold on by wretched covetous People, to advan∣tage and inrich themselves, in grinding the face of the Poor. The Man then desired, he might thrash some to sell to the Poor People in the Parish where he lived, who could get none at any rate
near at hand. But that was refused him, command∣ him to turn off the Taskers, or she would break their cks out of the Barn. This Discourse happening,  Farmer was forced to consent, and so payed m off, till he could get their Dame in a better mour, and give them further notice: But the an being importuned for Corn, he lay at her; t he might set the Men to work again. Set the en to work! replied she angrily, The Devil shall ash it first; or I'll sit on the M, and eat of the rs my self, before I'll have it  out to be sold  pitiful Rates, and some other the like Discourse ppened between them, and so to Bed they went. t a little before break of Day the Woman was akened with the thundring Noise of Flails in the arn, which made it seem to her as if there had een twenty Men at work: The Woman, upon is, thinking her Husband had set the Men on ork, waked him and upbraided him with it; ut he protested, That he had discharged them, and new not of any Bodies being there, for the Key of the arn lay on the Shelf in the Kitchen. The Woman, not believing him, rise in a rage, o turn out the supposed Thrashers, who, finding he Key as her Husband said, fancied nevertheless hey might have got in at the Pitching-bay, and hither she went, but had no sooner opened the Door but the Barn appeared very light within, ho' there were neither Candle nor any thing that
could reasonably give it to be seen; and there found a tall Fellow in black a thrashing, who  done so much Work, that there lay huge heap  Straw, and a little black Boy threw down  Sheaves to him as fast as he thrashed; whereat  falling in a passion, began to treat him by the Na of Rogue and Villain, charging him to be gone, or  would break his Neck: but he seemed not to mi her, his Back being towards her, but plied  Task, till Anger moved her to strike at him a attempt to tear his Hair; but she, instead of Ha seemed to lay hold on a Fire, that scorch'd her  that she cried out, O Lord, have mercy on me, wh is this? Whereat the supposed Man took her  the Arm, saying, I go, but you must stay; an canting her on the Mow, vanished through th Roof in a Cloud of Smoke, taking some part of  with him, as also his Imp that attended him. And now Day-light coming pretty clear, th Noise of the Flails ceased, and the Wife not returning he went to see why she stayed, and seeing her o the Mow, called to her; but she could not speak yet in her looks shewed much horror and affright¦ment, when going up to her, he sound her fast an immoveable, all his strength not being able to sti her: And looking on this as some Judgment, h called some Neighbours, who prayed for her▪ the her Speech came to her again, and she confessed, i was a Judgment upon her, by the conviction of her mind
telling what she had seen, and how she came on the Mow, showing the Hole in the Roof, and pointing to the Corn; when they went to look on it, being a great quantity, more than two Men could thrsh in a Day, they found it all black, parched, and as i were burned, being good for nothing, but to feed Hogs; and it is affirmed, That the Woman soon after telling the Story, falling into Ravings, decla¦red, It was revealed, or whispered in her Ear, Tha she was under the Just Hand of God, whom she ha offended, and could not be renounced thence, till a cer¦tain time. And so she continued Eating the Ears o the Corn, refusing all other Food, whil'st Prayer were made for her, That God would be merciful  her, and remove this Heavy Judgment from her. FINIS. Licens'd according to Order.
