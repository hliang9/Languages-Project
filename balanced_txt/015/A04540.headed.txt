A CHRISTIAN PLEA Conteyning three Treatises. I. The first, touching the Anabaptists, & others main∣teyning some like errours with them. II. The second, touching such Christians, as now are here, com∣monly called Remonstrants or Arminians. III. The third, touching the Reformed Churches, with vvhom my self agree in the faith of the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ. Made by FRANCIS IOHNSON, Pastour of the aun∣cient English Church, now sojourning at Amsterdam in the Low Countreyes. Esa. 50.5.6. The Lord hath opened myne eare; and I was not rebellious, ney∣ther turned away back. I gaue my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the haire: I hid not my face from shame & spitting. Ier. 15, 19. Thus saith the Lord, If thou returne, then wil I bring thee againe, & thou shalt stand before me: & if thou take forth the precious from the evill, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them returne unto thee, but returne not thou unto them. 2 Tim. 4, 7, 8. I haue fought a good fight, I haue finished my course, I haue kept the Faith. Henceforth there is layd up for me a crown of righteousnes, which the Lord the righteous Iudge shall giue me at that day: and not to me onely, but unto them also that loue his appearing. PRINTED, In the yeere of our Lord 1617.
To the Christian Reader: Grace mercy and peace be multiplied in Iesus Christ. CHristian Reader, I do here present unto thee, three Treatises joyned together in one book: which I wish may proue as profitable to the Church and people of God, as they are needful for this age, & estate of things, wherein we liue. Whereabout there are some few things that I would advertise thee, before thou come to read the treatises thēselues. 1. That thou wouldest obserue, how our Lord Iesus Christ, giving ordi∣nances to his Church under the Gospel, hath derived them from the practise & particulars had among the Iewes of old, varying therefrō as litle as might be, in such a different estate. For example, as they had their Synagogues, so haue we our particular churches and assemblies, Psal. 74, 8. Mat. 4.23. & 9.35. with Act. 20.28. Col. 4.16. Rev. 2.1. &c. They had in their Synagogues the ministration of the word of God and prayer: so likewise haue we. Act. 13.14.15. & 15.21. & 16.13. with Act. 2.42. 1 Cor. 14.3.15.16. 1 Tim. 2.1. & 4.13. They had for ordinarie Sacraments & seales of Gods covenant, Circumcisiō & the Passeover:See M. Brought. on Dan. 9.25, 26, 27. with that he al∣ledgeth out of R. Moses ben Maym. in Asure bi∣ah perek 13. And Ioseph. de bel. Iud. 6. cap. 31. And Paulus Burgens. in Psal. 112. & Tremell. & Scaliger de emendat. tempor. l. 6. And Beza on Matt. 26.20. we haue likewise baptisme & the Lords supper answering thereunto. Touching baptisme also, our Lord took it (as some haue observed) frō the Jewes baptizing of Proselytes, & washing of thēselues frō uncleannes, which was knowen & usual among thē. And the Lords supper likewise, frō a custome observed among the Iewes at the Passeover: at the end of the celebration wherof, the fathers of families were woont to take a cake of bread, & after the blessing thereof, to break & distribute it to the cōmunicāts: as also after that, a cup of wine, in like sort: Whereunto that may haue refe∣rence, which David speaketh, saying: What shal I rēder to the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I vvil take the cup of salvation, and cal on the name of the Lord. Psa. 116.12, 13. They had Sacrifices, which led thē to Christ, who was then to come to dye for our sinnes: we haue in stead thereof the Lords supper, which cōfirmeth unto us that Christ now is come, & hath dyed for our transgressions: the memorial whereof we doe stil obserue, shewing forth his death, til he come againe at that great day. Lev. 1. &c. Esa. 53.7 — 10. Dan. 9.24.26.27. with Ioh. 1.29. 1 Cor. 5.7. & 10.16. & 11.23. &c. They had the Sabbaths and Feast dayes for the solemne worship of God, in stead whereof we haue the Lords day. Exo. 20.8. Lev. 23. ch. Esa. 66.23. Zac. 14.16 — 19. with Act. 20.6.7. Rev. 1.10. They had Priests for offering the Sacrifices that were types of Christs death: we haue Pastours for celebration of the Lords supper, a memorial of his death & pas∣sion now performed, and still thankfully to be remembred. Exod. 28. Lev. 1. Num. 16. 2 Chron. 35.1. Ezech. 43, & 44. & 45. & 46, &c. with 1 Cor. 10.
16. & 11.23. Ephes. 4.11.12. Col. 4.17. They had Priests & Levites; we Pastours and Teachers for the work of the Ministerie. Num. 18. Deut. 33.8 — 11. 2 Chro. 35 ch. Esa. 66.21. with Ephe. 4.11.12. Rom. 12.7.8. They had for government, besides Priests and Levites, Ruling Elders al∣so, of the chief of the Fathers of Families among them: and we haue for go∣vernment, besides the Pastours and Teachers, the Ruling Elders also taken out of the people, in that behalf. And so, as they had a Synedrion or Consi∣storie of Elders, consisting of Priests, Levites, and Fathers of Families of the people among thē: so haue we a Presbyterie or company of Elders, consisting likewise of Pastours, Teachers, and Ruling Elders, chosen out of the people for the churches government. Deu. 19.17. 2 Chro. 19.8. Jer. 19.1. with 1 Tim. 5.17. Rom. 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. Act. 20.17.28. Heb. 13.7.17.24. They had for the Treasurie the Leviticall treasurers & other the like, to whō that busines was committed: we haue the Deacons for that use & service in that church. 1 Chro. 26.20— 28. 2 Chron. 31.12. &c. Neh. 13, 13. with Act. 6. 1 — 6. 1 Tim. 3.8— 13. They had for censures, Niddui, Cherem, and Schammatha, Seclusion, Cutting off, & utter devoting to judgment till the Lords comming at that day. We also haue the use of Suspension, of Excom∣munication, & of Anathema Maranatha. Num. 19 ch. Esa. 66.5. Iude v. 14 22.23. Luke 6.22. 2 Thes. 3.6.14.15. 1 Tim. 1.20. 1 Cor. 5.5.11.12.13. & 16.22. Finally, they had Ierusalem, where God set his name, and the Temple where he dwelt among them, & whither he required them to come with their sacrifices, &c. Which typed out unto us not onely the Ʋniversall church, but the particular churches also of Christians, where the Lord setteth his name, & dwelleth among us by his spirit, calling us thither to eate at his Table, and in all things to worship & serue him according to his word, Deu. 12.5, 6.7. & 16.2. Psa. 26.6, 7, 8. & 27.4. & 36.8 9. & 65.4. & 132. Esa. 27.13. & 66.23. Dan. 8, 11.13.14. & 11, 31. with Mat. 28.19.20. 1 Cor. 3. 16.17. & 2 Cor. 6.16. 2 Thes. 2.4. Rev. 3.12. & 21.2. &c. By this may also appear, how M. Ainsw. in his plea against M. Smyth, about the Ministerie, worship, & government of the Church, wrote once well (if he could haue kept unto it) whē he asked him, saying: What one thing haue we in the worship of God, which Israel had not before us? M. Ainsw. Defence of Scrip. pag. 10. Which being well observed, wil giue good light to many matters now in question. But I wil proceed to other things. 2. Whereas sometimes I alledge many Scriptures together, my meaning is not, that each of them proue the point in hand; but that to this end they are to be compared & layd together, & corfirmation of the truth to be derived frò thence, by consequence, & discourse of reason, as in questions of religion is woonted to be done.
3. The questions that I set down are divers: & abort them there is great diversitie of judgment. Touching some of thē I set down reasons but one way, & answer the objections to the contrarie. For others of thē sometimes I pro∣pound reasons both waies: & so leaue al to be examined & judged of, accor∣ding to the word of God. At first, I had thought onely to haue insisted upon the points thēselues, without mention of any adversaries, or confutation of any Opposites by name. But afterward, upon divers waighty reasons, I chaunged my purpose & course: & of manie Opposites haue named a few, & giuen a litle tast of the manifold Opposition that is made against us: noting withall a few instances of the many shifts, errors, contradictions, & abuse of Scriptures, into which they run & are caryed exceedingly.M. Ainsw. Animadv. &c. Where also I could mention (if I would) sundrie manifest untruths published by some: which are so very untrue, as I need not produce any other proof or witnes herein, but the publike records of Amsterdam stil extant, & the testimonie of such as were present, and heard and saw what was done: not excepting M. Ainsw. owne followers. Whom now moreover by this occasion I doe once againe exhort to consider their waies & estate in their heart: & to cal to mynd, both how they haue ben wanting in yeelding & bearing witnes to the truth, and how long now they haue continued in their schismaticall and scandalous Division frō the Church whereof they were: and that both for the matter, time, and man∣ner thereof: besides many other sinnes and transgressions, which they run into withall. A just recompence of their contumacie, frō vvhich they would not be reclaimed by any meanes. Neither doth it availe thē, that some others joy∣ned hand in hand with thē, becoming (as Simeon and Levi did) brethren in evill. In such cases we must still remēber and obserue what Iacob the Patri∣ark said, O my soule, come not thou into their secret: unto theirOr, Church as M. Ains. doth other∣where usu∣ally translat the word KAHAL: which here he doth not so. Note it. assembly myne honour be not thou united. Gen. 49.5.6. 4. Now of the Anabaptists, & Arminians, I need not speak particularly, Some of their opinions here following I haue noted and refuted,Gen. 37.9. Phil. 2.15. Iudg. 5, 31. Prov. 4.18. Dan. 8, 10.12. & 11.31.32. Act. 2.20.40. Rev. 6.12. both for the more clearing of the truth, & the further helping of others against their er∣rors, which do now here so much trouble & endaunger the estate of church & Common wealth. The Reformed churches, may for the faith of Christ which they professe, wel be estemed (as Israel was of old) in their measure & degrees, to be as the Sunne and moone, the lights of the world: Which should therfore stil increase in al shining light of the truth, & holynes, shyning more & more unto the perfit day, yea til they go forth as the Sunne in his might: & should be the more carefull hereof, seeing the Scrtpture also teacheth, how euenRev. 16.8. &c. Or, by the Sunne here, under∣stand hotte persecution. Sal. Song. 1. 6. Mat. 13.6, 21. upon the Sunne, shal a vial of Gods wrath be powred out, before the utter extyrpation & destuction of the Beasts throne & kingdome: & that the day is a comming, wherein the moone shalbe confounded,
& the Sunne ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reigne in mount Zion, & in Ierusalem, & before his auncients gloriously. Esa. 24.23. Which whether it shalbe at the conversion of the Jewes to the Christian faith (which now hasteneth on) time and the work of God will manifest: As also, in what manner shalbe verified that which the same Prophet hath foretold, saying: The light of the Moone shalbe as the light of the Sunne, and the light of the Sunne shalbe seuen fold, as the light of seuen dayes, in the day that the Lord byndeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound. 5. In the meane time, who doth not obserue and lament, that among the Lutherans and Reformed churches every where, there should still remain so many & great corruptions, errors, superstitions, & other transgressions, not re∣dressed or amended in the worship of God, & conversation of men? Which threaten some heavy judgment of God, not to be far off, if we meete not the Lord with true and unfeyned repentance in time. In which regard, al are to be exhorted, carefully & without delay, to think on their wayes, & to turne their feet into the Testimonies of the Lord. Buy the truth (saythPro. 23.23. Salomon) but sell it not: Part with any thing for it, but part not with it for any thing. Enter in at the strait gate (saythMatt. 7.13.24. Christ) for wide is the gate, & broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, & many there be which goe in thereat: but strait is the gate, & narrow is the way which leadeth to life, & few there be that find it. Finally, let us all labour (what in us is) to grow in grace, & in the knowledge and obedience of the truth, in all things: not regarding the applause or displeasure of men: but endevouring to please God more and more, & not onely to know & profeesse in word, but to obserue and practise in deed whatsoever the Lord hath commanded us: knowing thatDeu. 4, 1, 2. Matt. 28.20. Ioh. 7.17. & 13, 17. 1 Tim 6, 13.14. this hath the promise of blessing & acceptance with the Lord. Where∣in if these my poore labours shal any waie help and further thee, giue praise unto God: and remember me in thy prayers to the Lord: In whom I rest and still shall remaine thyne: FRANCIS IOHNSON, Pastour of the English exiled church sojourning (for the present) at Amsterdam. It was not an enemy that reproved me, then I could haue borne it; neyther was it he that hated me, that did magnifie himself against me, then I would haue hid my self from him. But it was thou, O man, myne equall, my guide, and myne acquaintance: who tooke sweete councell together, and walked into the house of God in company, Psal. 55.12.13.14 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evill against you falsely for my sake. Rejoyce, & be glad: for great is your reward in heauen: For so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you. Mat. 5, 11, 12,

THE FIRST TREATISE. Of some questions concerning the Anabaptists. CHAPTER I. Whether Baptisme is to be administred to Infants being the chil∣dren of the faythfull, or not. THE Anabaptists misunderstanding some Scriptures, and not finding in the New Testament mention of any chil∣dren by name, that were baptized, hold therefore that in∣fants are not to be baptized, though they be the children of such as doe beleeue. The errour of which opinion ap∣peareth by these Scriptures, and reasons deduced from them, & other the like. Gen. 17.7.12.13.14.26.27. Exo. 12.48.49. Zach. 2.11. Eph. 3.6. with Act. 2, 38, 39. & 3, 25. and 16, 15, 31, 33. 1 Cor. 1, 16. and 7, 14. and 10, 1, 2. Rom. 4, 11, 16, 17. & 15, 4, 8, 9, 10. Gal. 3, 8, 29. Eph. 4, 4, 5, 6. Col. 2, 8 — 12. & Psal. 22, 30, 31. Esa. 54, 10. Zach. 13, 1. Mar. 10, 13 — 16. I. Because it is the ordinance & commandement of God, to giue the signe and seale of his covenant of grace, to his people and their seed, in their infancie, throughout their generations. Gen. 17, 7, 12, 13, 14. Exo. 12, 48, 49. with Act. 2, 38, 39. & 3, 25. & 16, 15. Col. 2, 10, 11, 12. Which ordinance of the Lords hath never ben repealed, but abideth stablished upon a certaine & perpetuall ground, that is, his promise and covenant of grace made with the faythfull and their seed for ever. For which see the Scriptures here cited be∣fore: and these also which followe. Luke 1, 54, 55, 72. &c. and 19, 9. Act. 16, 31. Rom. 4, 11, 16, 17. and 15, 8, 9, 10. Gal, 3, 8, 29. Esa. 54, 10. Mal. 3, 6. Luk. 20, 37, 38. Hebr. 11, 13 — 16. and 13, 8, 20. Rev. 14, 6. II. And Christ hath confirmed the same, when he sent forth his Apostles & appointed themMatth. 28, 18, 19. and Mark 16, 15, 16. with Gal. 3, 8 — 29. Gen. 12, 3. and 17, 4, 5, 7, 12, 26, 27. with Act. 16, 15, 31, 33. Rom. 4, 9 — 17, and 11.13 — 16. and 15.8 — 16. 2 Cor. 1, 20. to make all the nations disciples, & to baptize them into the name of the Father the Sonne and the holy Ghost. For, to make the Gentiles disciples, is by the Gospel to bring them unto the covenant of God, made with Abraham, the Father of manie nations, for salvation through the name of Iesus Christ. Which covenant is everlasting, & in∣cludeth the faithful & their seed: So as therefore Baptisme (which hath now succeeded and doth seale it in stead of Circumcision) is by this ap∣pointment of Christ to be administred unto all that be brought & com∣prehended under that covenant of grace: and consequently both to such as are of yeeres comming to the faith of Christ, and to their children be∣ing yet infants. And otherwise,Zach. 2, 11. Esa. 42, 6, 7. and 49, 6, 22. Act. 13, 46, 47. Joh. 10, 16. 1 Cor. 1, 9, 13, 16. and 12, 13. Ephes. 2, 11 — 22. and 3, 6. the Gentiles should not with the Iewes be joyned to the Lord, and become his people with them, and be made
coinheriters, & of the same bodie, and joynt-partakers of the same pro∣mise of God in Christ, by the Gospel: as the Scripture teacheth. III. Which is yet the more manifest, inasmuch as the Scripture speaking both of the Iewes and Christian Gentiles, & of their Sacraments: saith, that1 Cor. 10, 1, 2. the Iewes of old were baptized, and thatCol. 2, 11, 12. the Christians now are circumcized, with circumcision made without hands (which the Apostle al∣so calleth the circumcision of Christ): and thatwith 1 Cor. 12, 12, 13. and Ephes. 3, 6. Esa. 49, 6, 22. both Iewes and Gentiles are fellow-heires, & partakers of the same promise in Christ, and of one & the same bodie under Christ the head. By which againe it is evident, that Baptisme is answerable to circumcision succeeding in the place there∣of, to be the Lords signe & seale of his covenant; and that Baptisme now is to be administred to the beleevers and their children, aswel as circum∣cision was heretofore. IIII. And this was also theAct. 16, 15, 33. 1 Cor. 1, 16. Apostles practise, at the publishing of the gospell through the world, to baptize both the householders themselues that beleeved, & their households also: Euen like aswith Gen. 15, 6. and 17, 26, 27. and 21, 4. Abraham first be∣leeved, and then was circumcised; and all his familie with him: And like asExod. 12, 48, 49. (And that by the speach of an house, familie, or houshold, children also are implyed therein, see Gen. 30, 25, 30. and 45, 18, 19. with 46, 5, 6, 7. Num. 3, 15. &c. Psal. 115, 12, 13, 14. 1 Tim. 5, 8.) Herein therefore Origen sayth well, thatOrig. in Epist. ad Rom. the Church received Baptisme of Infants from the Apostles. And Augustine, thatAugust. contra Do∣natist. lib. 4 ca. 23.24. the baptisme of In∣fants was not derived from the authoritie of man, or Councils, but from the tradition or doctrine of the Apostles. the stranger of the Gentiles, which received the faith of the Iewes, & would keep the Passeover, was not onely circumcised himself, but all the males also that were his. V. Moreover, the children of beleevers are holy, & are Abrahams seed, and heires by promise of the kingdome of heauen & eternall blessednes. And who can then withhold the baptisme of water from them, to whom God vouchsafeth the baptisme of his spirit, and the blessing of Abraham to an inheritance everlasting in his heauenly kingdome? 1 Cor. 7, 14. Rom. 11, 16. Act. 3, 25. Gal. 3, 29. Esa. 46, 3, 4. Psal. 22, 10, 30, & 71, 6. & 115, 12, 13, 14, 15. Luke 1, 41, 44. Act. 10, 47. Rom. 8, 9, 16. Luke 19, 9. Mark 10, 13 — 16. VI. And Baptisme is the Lords signe, of his washing awaie of our sinnes, receiving of us into the Church, and incorporating of us into Christ, for
salvation by his death and resurrection: Whereof the children of belee∣vers are partakers, aswell as they which be of yeeres: and therefore can no more be deprived of Baptisme, then of remission of sinnes, entrance in to the Church, ingraffing into Christ, & salvation by his meanes. Rom. 6, 3, 4. and 5, 14, 15. Zac. 13, 1. 1 Cor. 1, 13 — 16. and 12, 13. Act. 4, 12. with 16, 30— 34. and 22, 16. Gal. 3, 27, 28, 29. Ephes. 2, 19. & 5, 25 — 30. Tit. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Rev 1, 4, 5. Whereupon Origen writeth thus:Orig. tom. 2. ho∣mil. 14. in Lucam. Children are baptised for the remission of sinnes. Of what sinnes? Or when haue they sinned? Or how can there be any reason of the laver in children, but according to the sense whereof we spake? There is none pure from uncleannes, no not if their life be but one day upon the earth. VII. Neyther is there any thing required in the ministration of Baptisme (nor was heretoforeGen. 17, 7, 12, 26. and 21, 4. in circumcision) whereof young infants are not capable, as wel as elder people: whereas in the ministration of the Lords supper it is farre otherwise. Forand 1 Cor. 1, 16. Act. 16, 14, 15, 33. Matt. 28, 18, 19. with in baptisme the minister isI speak of the out∣ward agent. the agent alone, & the person baptized (whether old or young) is onely a patient, & not an agent: but “ in the Lords supper (besides the actions laid upon the Minister) there are diverse actions required also of the receivers; as namely, to take, to eat, to drinke, to doe it in remembrance of Christ, to shewe forth the Lords death, to examine themselues, and so to eat of that bread, and drink of that cuppe. All which actions are required of the receivers of the Lords sup∣per, whereby they also are made agents therein, and not the Ministers onely. But in baptisme it is not so: for in it, the action is wholly enjoy∣ned and layd upon the baptizer, and not upon the baptized. So that euen by the institution and administration of baptisme, compared with the in∣stitution and administration of the Lords supper, the trueth of this point yet further is cleared and confirmed unto us.Matth. 26, 26, 27, 28, and 1 Cor. 11, 23 — 28. VIII. And there is likewiseEphe. 4, 4.5, 6. one Baptisme, as there is1 Cor. 12, 13. and 10, 1, 2. with Exo. 12, 37. 1 Pet. 3, 20, 21. with Gen. 7, 1. Gal. 3, 8, 27, 28, 29. one bodie, and1 Tim. 2, 5. Joh. 10, 16. one Mediator and confirmer of one covenant of grace, to the faithful & their seed in al ages. So as thereforeAct. 2, 38, 39. Psal. 100, 3, 5. Ephe. 1, 22, 23. and 2, 19 — 22. & 5, 23, 25, 26, 27, 32. one & the same baptisme perteyneth to the children of the faithfull together with the parents themselues: as they are also of one and the same bodie with them, having one and the same Mediatour & ratifyer of Gods covenant of grace unto them, euen Iesus Christ, the head and Saviour of his Church, which is his bodie, the fulnes of him that filleth al in al things. IX. Besides that the Children of Beleevers being under the covenant of God, and perteyning to Christ and to his church and kingdome, they are therefore now to be distinguished from the children of unbeleevers by a
signe of difference, and consequently by baptisme, as the children of the faythfull were of old by circumcision. Otherwise there should now be a greater confusion, without difference betvveen the church & the vvorld, then vvas heretofore; and the children of beleevers, vvhich the Apostle sayth are holy, should be brought into one and the same ranke & estate vvith the uncleane children and seed of unbeleevers. Contrary to the Apo∣stles doctrine, 1 Cor. 7, 14. compared with Matth. 19, 14. and Esa. 52, 1. Judg. 14, 3, 1 Sam. 14, 6. and 17, 36. 2 Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. X. Els also the grace of God to his people should novv since Christ his comming in the flesh be lessened and straitned more then it vvas before; the comfort & confirmation of the faithfull for themselues & their chil∣dren should not novv be so great and so fully ratified by Christ, as for∣merly it vvas; and vve should not novv be so compleete and throughly furnished in Christ, as they aforetime vvere: Finally by their opinion (be∣ing vvell observed) it vvould follovve, that neyther the Scriptures haue giuen assurance of the recalling of the Ievves, nor the Apostles sufficient∣ly ansvvered such as urged circumcision upon the Gentiles, &c. Which things to affirme or admit, is highly to derogate from the grace of God, the fulnesse of Christ and his Gospell, the comfort of Christians, the sure hope of the ingraffing againe of the Ievves, the faithfulnes of the Apo∣stles and sufficiency of their doctrine recorded in the Scriptures. And so contrarie to that vvhich is vvritten, Col. 2, 8 — 12. Rom, 4, 11 — 24. and 11, 11 — 36. and 15, 4. Gen. 7, 1. with 1 Pet. 3, 18 — 22. 1 Cor. 1, 16. and 10, 1 — 4. Luke 19, 9. Esa 49, 6. Act. 15, 1 — 31: and 16, 15, 33. and 26, 6, 7.22, 23. Gal. 1, 6 — 9. and 3, 8 — 29. Ephes. 2, 18, 19. Hebr. 13, 8. Rev. 13, 8. and 14, 6, and 21, 3; 9, 10, 11, 12. &c. OBJECTION I. But the Anabaptists still object, Why then is there not in the New Testament, mention of some child by name, that was baptized? ANSWER. 1. The particular mention of anie such by name, needed not to be in the nevv Testament: because the commandement of sealing children vvith the signe of Gods covenant, vvas before in Israel; and is a morall & perpetuall ordinance of God, as vvas shevved here before, Pag. 1. and ap∣peareth likewise in the books of the old Testament: where some children by name (that vvere sealed vvith the signe of circumcision) are particu∣larly mentioned: Gen. 21.4 Exod. 4, 24, 25, 26. as some also be in the books of the Nevv Testament, in Luke 1, 59. and 2, 21. And this point (viz. that the Nevv Testament needed not repeat the things had in Israel, vvhich vvere morall and perpetuall) is the more to be noted: because the due observation thereof cleareth not onely this matter in hand, but divers other questions also, about the sacraments, and other things concerning the churches vvorshipp, order, government, estate, and course of life among Christians. Which vvhile it hath not ben observed, as it should,
ch errour and trouble about sundrie things in the Church among ristians hath risen, and is still continued, to the great hinderance of e trueth, and dishnour of the Name of God. The speciall things to be declared in the Nevv Testament, vvere the hibiting of the Messiah in the flesh, for the redemption of his people; e opening of that mysterie of the incarnation of the Sonne of God, his fferings, death, buriall, resurrection, ascension into heauen, and sit∣ng at the right hand of God; the fulfilling and correction of the sha∣vves and ceremonies of the Lavv; the manifestation and establish∣ent of such things, as comming in stead thereof, should not be sha∣ken, but endure to the end; the spreading of the Gospell abroad in the vvorld, and the opening of the mysterie of the Gentiles calling; with such like things: as may be seen in the histories of the Gospell vvrit∣ten by the Evangelists: and particularly, Matth. 1, 1. &c. Marke 1, 1, 2, &c. Luke 1, & 2, & 3, & 4, &c. and 24, 44 — 48. Ioh. 20, 31. Matt. 26, 7 — 29. and 28, 18, 19, 20. Iohn 19, 30, 36. And in the Acts of the Apo∣stles. And in their Epistles throughout. Rom. 1, 2, &c. and 16, 25, 26. Galat. 4. chap. Ephes. 4, 5, 6. Col. 1, 25, 26, 27, 28. and 2. chap. The Epistles to Timo∣thee, Titus, and the Hebrewes. 1 Pet. 5, 12. Revel. 2, 24, 25. and 19, 9, 10. &c. Other things that vvere morall, and formerly had in Israell, needed not be repeated, but still to be learned out of Moses and the Prophets, and perpetually to be reteined. (Of vvhich sort, this particular of sea∣ling the children of beleevers, is one.) 2 Timoth. 3, 16, 17. Luke 16, 29, 31. Rom. 15, 4. 1 Cor. 4, 6. Heb. 13, 8. 2 Pet. 1, 19. with Josh. 1, 8. Psal. 119, 142. Esa. 8, 20. Neyther doth it hinder that some morall things sometimes are repea∣ted in the books of the Nevv Testament: seeing that all such things are not repeated in the nevv, as they are sette dovvne in the Old; and sun∣drie reasons may be observed in sundrie places (vvhere some are re∣peated or spoken off) vvhy it vvas good and needfull so to doe. Which were long to insist upon. As in Matth. 5, 21 — 44. and 9, 13. and 18, 15, , 17. and 19, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Marke 7, 10, 11, 12, 13. Luke 17, 3. Act. 7,  Rom. 13, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1 Cor. 6, 9, 10. and 10, 7, 8, 9, 10. Ephes. 5, 3, 4, 6 — 14. 1 Timoth. 1, 8, 9, 10, 11. and 5, 17, 18. Hebr. 12, 5, 14, 15, 16. and 13, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Iam. 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Pet. 1, 15, 16, 17. and 3,  &c. Revel. 2, 14, 20. and 19, 10. Nor is there in such case anie waight in the exception that is made a∣bout the abolition of the ceremonies, or about the differences between them and us, and betweene their ministration and ours: seing we speak ely of such things as are moral, or doe agree in their general proper∣, and common equitie, which abideth for ever. Of which I shal speak ore hereafter in the answer of the fift objection. Now then seing the ministration of the seale of Gods covenant, unto ldren, was had in Israel, and is a morall and perpetuall ordinance of
God: seing also in the Old Testament there is mention of some children by name, that were so circumcised, and in the New Testament we are taught, that baptisme is now unto us in stead of circumcision (Col. 2, 11, 12) it is therefore evident, that there needed not be, in the New Testament, particular mention of anie children by name, that were baptized. Yea if the names of some children so baptized, had been particularly expressed, yet should we notwithstanding looke to the ground whereupon it was done, and to the ordinance of God thereabout. Which we may now doe aswell, as if their names were mentioned in particular. And this may be sufficient to satisfie such as are of judgement and indifferencie. 2. Besides that, the precepts, practise, & reasons which are mentioned in the New Testament, about the ministration of Baptisme, (if they be duely weighed) doe as necessarily imply the baptizing of the children of the faithfull together with themselues, aswell as if their names had beene particularly set downe. Of which see here before, pag. 1. &c. 3. Yea there is expresse mention of children, Act. 2, 39. where there is also speach of baptisme, for the remission of sinnes, in the name of Christ; & the reason thereof annexed, (in regard of the promise made also unto children) ver. 38, 39. Whereabout obserue withal, whether the precepts of the Scripture are not to reach so farre, as the reasons annexed thereunto doe extend. As in Deu. 7, 1 — 4. compared with Ezra 9, 1, 2, 11, 12. and 2 Chron. 21, 6. and manie other the like. And so in this place, where there is men∣tion of children in the reason, that therefore the precept of baptizing, here spoken of, implyeth them also. Act. 2, 38, 39. Otherwise how wil the Ana∣baptists proue, by the institution, or first celebration of the Lords Sup∣per, that women should be partakers thereof: seing that (neither there, nor other where in the New Testament) there is mention of anie women by name, that were present and did partake thereof. And yet seing the reasons that are annexed to the precepts thereof, doe necessarily implye women as well as men, and there is no where any special prohibition to the contrarie: who can denie it unto them, without great sinne and im∣pietie? Matth. 26, 17, 20.26, 27, 28. Luke 22, 14, 19, 20. 1 Cor. 11, 23, 24, 25. Not to speak, how they were admitted to the Passeover; in stead whereof we haue the Lords supper: nor of other reasons that might be alledged thereabout. 4. Lastly, there is expresse mention, not onely of baptizing the fathers & mothers of families, but also of their house or household, and al that were theirs. Act. 16, 15, 33. 1 Cor. 1.16. And both the terme of an house, familie or houshold, implyeth the children therein, as the Scripture plainely sheweth,Pag. 2. (as I shewed before) Gen. 30, 25 — 30. compared with 1 Tim. 5, 9. Pro. 31, 15. Luke 19, 9. Iudg. 1, 25. and Gen. 45, 18, 19. with ver. 10, 11. and 46, 5, 6, 7. Exod. 1, 1. Numb. 3, 15, 39. Psal. 115, 12.13, 14. and in other like places, where there is not any restreint annexed, as sometimes there is, as in Gen. 50, 7, 8. Num. 32, 16, 17, 18, 26, 27. and the other phrase (where it is said, the Iaylour was baptized, and) all that were his, compriseth also children therein: as
y be seen Numb. 16, 30, 33. compared with ver. 27. where the like phrase is ed and explaned. as when in one verse he sayth of Dathan & Abiram, y, their wiues, their sonnes, and their litle children, ver. 27. and in other verses ayth, they and all that apperteined unto them, or, they, and all that were theirs. ver. , 33. Where it is further to be noted, that in the same place speaking concerning Korah, he saith not generally, as he did of Dathan & Abiram,  that apperteined to Korah, but he restreyneth it, saying, all the men that apper∣teyned to Korah, ver. 32. so exempting the children of Korah, who dyed not with the rest there spoken off. Numb. 26, 11. Which also plainly sheweth, how in such cases the children are comprised in the generall phrase, of all that were theirs, where there is no restraint in the speach, or exception to the contrarie: as in the place aforesaid. OBJECTION II. But it is said of the Iaylour, in this place of the Acts, that the word of the Lord was preached to him, and to all that were in his house, and that he re∣joyced, beleeving vvith all his household. Act. 16, 32, 34. Whereof children (say they) being not capable, therefore there were no children here, or if there were anie, they were not baptized. ANSWER. 1. Neyther of these two collections of theirs, will followe thereupon. It is an usuall thing in the Scripture, and in all tongues, to use such spea∣ches in generall cases, of houses, cities, and the like: wherein yet everie particular person or thing is not either implyed, or denyed to be at al, as here they would gather. For example, when it is said, The Lord closed up all the vvombs of Abimilecks houshold, Gen. 20, 17, 18. and the house of Pharoah heard, Gen. 45, 2, 16. the citie of Shushan rejoyced, Ester 8, 15. all Jerusalem was troubled, Mat. 2, 3. all the citie was moved, Matth. 21, 10. what a vaine and unreasonable collection were it to gather, that either there were no children in these houses and cities, or els that they also were so intreated and affected, as here is said. 2. Neyther can such phrases hinder, but that the other speach, where it is said, he was baptized, and all his, may imply the children with the father himself. Act. 16, 33. Like as I shewed here before, out of Numb. 16, 27, 30. And as in this same chapter, where it is said onely of Lydia, (the mother of the familie) that she heard Paul, and the Lord opened her heart, so as she attended to the words which he spake: yet this hindreth not, but that both she was bap∣tized and her householde; of whom notwithstanding it is not said, that they heard Paul, and beleeved; but this here is onely spoken of Lydia her self: who being by Pauls preaching brought to the fayth of Christ, she was baptized, and her household with her. Act. 16, 14, 15. 3. And if children should not haue ben baptized, as before they had n circumcised: here was both fit place, and just occasion, for the Apo∣stles themselues, & for the Scripture (recording their acts) to haue made ception of children expressely; and not to haue used such speaches and
termes, as in other places of the Scripture are used, to include and imply children therein: as vve haue shevved here before. So as euen hereby we may therefore learne,Pag. 2. and 4. and be more assured, that in the ministration of baptisme the Apostles still reteyned like practise, as had ben bsed before in circumcising of children, when the fathers of families beleeved, & had received circumcision themselues. Gen. 17, chap. and 21, 4. Exod. 12, 48, 49. OBJECTION III. But Christ commaunded the Apostles first to teach, and then to baptize Matth. 28, 18, 19. And so the Apostles practised, Act. 2, 14 — 41. and 8, 35 — 38. and 10, 34 — 48. and 16.14, 15, 31, 32, 33, 34. and 18, 4 — 8. ANSWER. 1. The Word of God is not the bare letter or outward syllables, but the intendement and meaning of the holy Ghost, by whom it was giuen Which should carefully be observed by the due consideration of the Scri¦ptures, vvith the circumstances thereof, and by the conference of other places of Scripture, and the proportion of fayth layd together. Which vvhiles the Anabaptists neglect, they look on the Scripture partially, and presse the letter extreamely, vvithout consideration of the true & right meaning thereof: neyther observing the time & persons, of vvhom the Scripture speaketh, nor conferring the Scriptures of the old and new Te∣stament together, nor regarding the analogie and proportion of fayth, as they should. Much like as the Papists deale, vvhen they presse the letter, in other vvords of Christ, vvhere it is said, This is my bodie: Matth. 26, 26. & others also, in those vvords, Tell the Church, &c. Matth. 18, 17. So in much like manner doe the Anabaptists in these, Teach all nations, and baptize them, &c. Matth. 28, 19. Where the Scripture it self being duely weighed, and compared together vvith other places, according to the proportion of faith, it vvill be found necessarily to imply the baptizing of children, & so to be directly against themselues. The vvord here used, signifieth to make scholers or disciples, and consequently to teach: as may be seen, in Mat. 27, 57. Act. 14, 21. Matt. 13, 52. Now the thing to be taught the nations, that they might become disciples of Christ, vvas the Gospell: as Mark shew∣eth, vvhen he relateth the same commission, saying, Goe into all the world, & preach the Gospell to every creature. Mark 16, 15. And vvhat Gospell? Euen that vvhich vvas preached before unto Abraham: As the Apostle tea∣cheth expressely, vvhen he sayth that the Scripture (foreseeing that God would justifie the heathen through faith) preached before the Gospell unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. Gal. 3, 8. Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. ver. 16. And vvhosoever are Christs, they are also Abra∣hams seed, and heires according to the promise. ver. 29. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gaue it to Abraham by promise. ver. 18. Which Gospell, and promise giuen unto Abraham, the Apostles were by Christ appointed to teach and make knovvne in the world, that the Gentiles should
fellow heires (with the Iewes) and of the same bodie, and joynt partakers of Gods omise in Christ, by the Gospell. Ephes. 3, 6. with Gen. 12, 3. and 17, 7. and 22, 18. om vvhich Scriptures compared together, and understood according to the proportion of faith, we learne, that the Gospell preached, and pro∣mise made unto Abraham, comprehendeth all that are Christs,Psal. 47, 3 4, 8, 9. Zac. 2, 11. vvhether Iewes or Gentiles: and that the Gentiles being by the Gospel made fel∣lovv-heires, and of the same body vvith the Ievves, and joynt-partakers of Gods promise in Christ; it must therefore needes follovve hereupon, that their children, asvvel as the children of the Ievves, are together with their Parents under the covenant of grace, and to be made partakers of the seale thereof vvith them. Which things the Apostles knovving vvell, did therefore accordingly understand the commission of Christ: & there∣upon also publishing the Gospel abroad in the vvorld, baptized not onely the Fathers of families, but those also that vvere theirs: as the Scriptures before alledged doe manifest. 2. Neyther in deed could the Apostles any othervvise understand, nor might they any othervvise practise, the commission aforesaid: seeing by this meanes the Gentiles should become the Lords people, as the Ievves vvere; and the Christian church novv succeeded into the place of the church of Israel, under one and the same Lord, having one and the same covenant in Christ, vvith like benefit and mysterie of the Sacraments un∣to them both: as the Prophets had foretold. Esa 49, 5 — 22. and 60, chap. and 66, 18 — 23. Hos. 1, 10. and 2, 23. Amos 9, 11, 12. Micah 4, 1, 2. Zach. 2, 11. & 13, 1. with Act. 13, 46, 47. and 15, 14 — 18. Rom. 9, 24, 25, 26. 1 Cor. 5, 7. and 10, 1 — 4. & 12, 12, 13. Ephes. 2, 11 — 22. and 3, 6. and 4, 4, 5, 6. Phil. 3, 3. In so much that the Apostle Paul expressely saith, the Israelites of old vvere baptised 1 Cor. 10.2. and the Christians novv are circumcised, Col 2, 11. though not according to the outvvard ceremonie, yet according to the spirituall in∣tendement and mysterie thereof. And moreover, that the aforesaid pro∣mise of the Gospell made unto Abraham, includeth the kinreds and fa∣milies of the earth among the Gentiles (vvhich all the vvorld knovves haue children in them) as vvell as the families of the Ievves. According as the Apostle Peter speaking to the Ievves alledgeth it, vvhen he saith, Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made vvith our fa∣thers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kinreds (or families) of the earth be blessed. Act. 3, 25. vvith Gen. 12, 3. and 22, 18. Where marke, that he useth the vvord, kinreds, or fathers-families (so to speake, according as the vvord in the originall is derived:) as it vvere of purpose to imply herein the kinreds of the Gentiles, the families and children together vvith their fa∣thers. According as the Apostles also observed, in their practise, baptizing the families together vvith the fathers thereof: as appeareth in the Scri∣ptures aforesaid. Cleane contrarie to the opinion & practise of the Ana∣baptists, vvho haue no regard of the kinreds or families in this behalf: but onely of that vvhich such as are of yeres, being taught, professe for them selues from time to time.
3. Neyther doe they (as they should) consider the time, and persons, spo∣ken of in the Scriptures alledged by themselues. The time was, at the first publishing of the Gospell abroad among all nations, & manifesting that Iesus vvas the Christ novv come in the flesh. The persons vvere, both Ievves, and Gentiles, of all the nations of the vvorld, beginning at Ieru∣salem, and going through Iudea, & Samaria, & so to the uttermost parts of the earth. Matth. 28, 18.19. Mar. 16, 15. vvith Luke 24.46, 47, 48. & Act. 1, 8. and 2, 4, 5. &c. Novv for the Ievves, although they vvere alreadie the church and people of God under his covenant, yet vvere they to haue knovvledge giuen them, that the Christ vvas novv come, vvhom they expected, according to the promise of God concerning him, and that Ie∣sus vvas he, vvho vvas put to death among them, and risen againe from the dead. Which the Apostles therefore taught and witnessed unto them: calling them to repentance, and faith in his name for remission of sinnes: according as Christ had appointed them to doe. Luke 24, 46, 47, 48. with Act. 2, 5 — 38. &c. and then withall instructing and exhorting them to be baptized in his name, alledged this ground and reason thereof, because the promise was to them, and to their children. Act. 2, 39. making expresse men∣tion of children: and so shewing how they understood the aforesaid com∣mission of Christ, to imply the children, together with the Parents them∣selues Which is directly against the Anabaptists. And as for the Gentiles, they being aliens from the common wealth of Israell, & straungers from the covenant and promise of God, they were also to be taught the Gos∣pell: because in the calling of such, God alwaies beginneth with those that are of yeeres, and will haue faith and obedience to be required of them afore they be baptized. Ephes. 2, 11 — 22. with Act. 16, 31, 32, 33. Which therefore the Apostles accordingly observed. But then also when such were brought to the faith of Christ, they did together with them baptise their households: as hath ben shewed before. Which is likewise directly against the Anabaptists.Pag. 2. The same course we acknowledge is still to be observed, when we haue to deale with like persons in such cases. For ex∣ample, in dealing with anie Pagans, Turkes, or other the like that beleeue not in Christ, we should first preach the Gospel unto them, to bring them to the faith: and then when any of them beleeue & become disciples of Christ, we should baptize them, & their households, as the Apostles did. Thus if the Anabaptists would but consider the times, persons, and cases, as they ought, they might soone see their errour, & learne to put difference (otherwise then they doe) between the unbeleeving Gentiles, & the chil∣dren of beleeving Christians; between the baptized & unbaptized, whe∣ther Iewes or Gentiles, old and young. Which whiles they doe not, they understand things generally, which are spoken respctiuely: and so mis∣apply the Scriptures: which being rightly understood, overthrow those verie things for which they alledge them: as in the case and Scriptures aforesaid may be seen. Yea and (that which is worst of al) if the poynt in hand be well mynded, they bring in another Gospell, which the Scripture
ever taught: or in deed pervert and diminish (if not deny) the Gospell, which the Scripture preached to Abraham, and the Apostles to the nati∣ons over the world (whiles they deny the covenant of Gods grace; or Baptisme the seale thereof to apperteyne to the children of the faithfull) as by that which hath ben said hereabout may sufficiently appeare. OBJECTION IIII. But it is not right to reason thus from Abraham, or from circumcision: see∣ing that circumcision was giuen to Abrahams carnal seed, for a carnal seale, of a carnall covenant and temporarie promise, touching the land of Canaan: whereas Baptisme apperteyneth to the spirituall seed of Abraham, and hath heauenly promises of salvation and eternall life, by Iesus Christ. ANSWER. 1. Abraham in deed had a carnall seed, and temporarie promises: but not such onely. For he had also a spirituall seed, and spirituall promises: whereof circumcision was the seale: As the Lord himself shewed at the first institution thereof, when he stablished his everlasting covenant with Abraham and his seed, to be his God; and the God of his seed after him. Gen. 17, 7 — 10. Now God is our God, onely in Christ: in whom the cove∣nant was established by his blood, and confirmed with the seale of cir∣cumcision. As the Apostle plainely teacheth, Gal. 3, 17. and Hebr. 13, 20. and thereupon calleth the signe of circumcision, a seale (not of an earthly or tem∣porarie promise) but of the righteousnes of faith: which is heauenly and spiri∣tuall. Rom. 4, 11. with Gen. 12, 3. and 15, 5, 6 and 17, 7 — 13. & 22, 18. Gal. 3, 19 — 29. 2. If they meane by a carnall seale, an outward visible seale: so also is Baptisme: but will they therefore call it a carnall seale? If they meane, that it vvas visible in the flesh: there was a speciall reason thereof (be∣sides that vve also haue washing with water, or sprinkling of water upon the flesh:) for it was to be with blood, and to lead them to Christ, who should come of Abrahams seed according to the flesh. Gen. 12, 3. and 17, 11. and 22, 18. and Exod. 4, 26. with Heb. 2, 14, 15, 16. Yet doth not this hin∣der us to reason from circumcision to Baptisme: as the Apostle sheweth, who so reasoneth himself. Col. 2, 10, 11, 12. and as we doe also (after the Apostles example) from the Passeover and other sacrifices, to the Lords supper. 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7, 8. and 10, 16, 17, 18. 3. And where they call it a carnall covenant, which circumcision sealed: what a straunge maner of speach and opinion is this? The promise of Canaan (whereunto they would restreyne it) was in deed annexed with the everlasting covenant, which God made with Abraham in Christ, for eternall blessednes and salvation in him. But Canaan it self, was a type of the heauenly inheritance, and of the kingdome of God, in Iesus Christ. Which also, euen that joyning of them together may imply. Gen. 17, 7, 8. with 22, 18. and Gal. 3, 15 — 29. Besides that now with us also godlynes hath the promise of the life that now is, & of that which is to come. 1 Tim. 4, 8.
Shall we therefore call this a carnall promise? Doth not God himself, who made the covenant with Abraham, call it his everlasting covenant, Genes. 17, 7. and the Apostle likewise, Heb. 13, 20. And shal we then cal or count it a carnall covenant? Was not the promise this, that in Abrahams seed all families of the earth should be blessed? Gen. 12, 3. and 22, 18. with Act. 3, 25. and Gal. 3, 8. And, that the Lord would be a God to Abraham, and to his seed after him? Gen. 17, 7, 8. And was this then a carnal covenant? Yea was was not the covenant confirmed in Christ: and that also, 430 yeeres be∣fore the Law was giuen? Gal. 3, 17. Or was it not confirmed to Abraham by the signe of circumcision, as a seale annexed to the promise of God? Gen. 17 chap. with Act. 7, 8. Which the Apostle calleth, the seale of the righteous∣nes of faith. Rom. 4, 11. And was this then a carnall seale, of a carnall covenant? How directly contrary are such sayings & opinions to the word of God? 4. If Circumcision was the seale onely of the temporarie covenant of the land of Canaan: what then did it profit Abraham himself in this be∣half, to whom God gaue no inheritance in it, no not so much as the bredth of a foot. Act. 7, 5. But Abraham by faith sojourned in the land of pro∣mise, as in a straunge countrey, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heires with him of the same promise. For he (euen as we) looked for a city which hath foun∣dations, whose builder and maker is God. And, they desired a better countrey, that is, an heauenly: Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. Heb. 11, 9.10, 16. From which very speach, that God is the God of Abraham, Isaak, and Jacob, Exod. 3, 6, 15, 16. Christ proveth the resurrection from the dead. Matth. 22, 31, 32. Luk. 20, 37, 38. Which also sheweth the covenant made with Abra∣ham to be a spirituall and everlasting covenant. 5. If Circumcision was the seale to Abrahams carnall seed, touching the land of Canaan: why then did not circumcision cease, when they en∣joyed and possessed the land? For Sacraments cease, when the promises are fulfilled, whereof they are signes, and seales: as the verie termes of a signe, and seale, may imply. And thereupon it is, that we shall haue no need or use of prophecies, Sacraments, or other like things, in the king∣dome of heauen after this life, as now we haue in this life here on earth. 1 Cor. 13, 8, 12. with chap. 11, 23 — 26. 6. If Circumcision was a seale to Abraham and his carnall seed, onely of a carnall covenant or temporarie promise touching the land of Ca∣naan: why then did God appoint the proselytes of the Gentiles that came to the Passeover, and their children, to be circumcised: seeing they were not of Abrahams carnall seed, nor had the promise of the land of Ca∣naan? Exod. 12, 48, 49. But in deed circumcision sealed to them the same righteousnes of faith, (and so the spirituall covenant of God in Christ) as it did to Abraham, and the Iewes that were his carnall seed. Rom. 4, 11. with Gen. 12, 3. and 15, 5, 6. and 17, 7 — 13. with Exod. 12, 48, 49. 7. And whereasMr. Sm. repl. to M. Clift. Arg. 2. some say, that circumcision was also a seale of obedience to the law of Moses: how can this be, when as it was appointed to Abraham four hundred and thirty yeeres afore the Law was giuen? Gal. 3, 17. with
en. 12, 3. and 17 chap. And Moses himself vvas not borne, till divers gene∣tions after Abraham. Gen. 21, 2, 3. and 25, 19, 26. and 29, 21, 34. with Exod. 6, 16 — 20. True it is, that as Circumcision vvas also one of the ceremo∣nies, being repeated and required in Moses Lavv (Lev. 12, 3.) so they that vvere circumcised (after the Lavv vvas giuen) became debters to doe the vvhole lavv. Gal. 5, 3. But as it vvas of the Fathers, and not of Moses, being before appointed to Abraham, to vvhom the Gospell vvas preached, and the covenant confirmed, four hundred and thirtie yeres before the Lavv, (Gen. 17, 7 — 13. Joh. 7, 22. Gal. 3, 8, 17.) so it vvas a seale of the righteousnes of faith, & of the remission of sinnes in Christ. Rom. 4, 1 — 11. Also vve that are novv baptised, are bound to obserue all things, vvhatsoever Christ hath commaunded. Matt. 28, 18, 19, 20. Yet notvvithstanding baptisme to us, is the seale (not of our obedience, no nor of our faith, but) of the righ∣teousnes of faith, and of the Lords forgiving our sinnes, in Iesus Christ. Rom. 4, 1 — 11 — 25. and 6, 3. with Act. 2, 38, 39. and 22, 16. For the seale of God (in circumcision and Baptisme) confirmeth a perfit sure and firme cove∣nant, euen the Lords everlasting covenant of grace (Gen. 17, 7 — 13.Deu. 32, 4. Psal. 111, 9 & 145, 17. Rom. 11, 29. Rev. 14, 6. & Heb. 13, 20 with Act. 2, 38, 39. and 3, 25.) vvhereas our faith and observation of the Lords commandements, like as theirs in Israell, is infirme & unper∣fit. Matt. 6, 30. and 8, 26. Mar. 9, 24. Luke 17, 5. & Rom. 7, 12 — 25. Jam. 3, 2. 1 Joh. 1, 8, 9, 10. And it is our comfort in tentations, that although vve are vveak & sinful, yet the Lords covenant of grace, confirmed unto us in baptisme, as it vvas to them in circumcision, is firme and holy, euen an everlasting covenant, established by the death and blood shedding of Iesus Christ: vvho of God is made unto us vvisedome, and righteousnes, & sanctifica∣tion, and redemption: that according as it is vvritten, He that glorieth, let him glorie in the Lord. 1 Cor. 1, 30, 31. and Jer. 9, 23. with Hebr. 13, 20. 8. Moreover, to be of the carnall seed of Abraham, vvhich is so much objected, did not hinder the Ievves, but that they might also be his spirituall seed in Christ. And so they are acknovvledged by the Apostles, vvho call them the children of the promise, & of the covenant which God made with the fathers, saying to Abraham, In thy seed shall al kinreds of the earth be blessed. Act. 2, 39. and 3, 25. Gal. 3, 15 — 29. Rom. 11, 16. &c. 9. Finally, their outvvard circumcision, signified and taught them, the invvard and spirituall circumcision of the heart, by the spirit of God, in Christ: like as our outvvard baptisme, shevveth and teacheth us the very same thing: which is wrought by the sanctification of the spirit, and by the cleansing of us from our sinnes, in the blood of Iesus Christ. Col. 2, 11, 12. Deut. 10, 16. and 30.6. with Act. 15, 10, 11. and Rom. 6, 3 — 6. 1 Cor. 6, 11. Tit. 3, 4 — 7. 1 Pet. 3, 21. OBJECTION V. But there is great difference betweene the Iewes and us; between their estate before Christ, being then as in the infancie, and ours since Christ, being growne in yeeres; between their administration and ours; and particularly,
between their circumcision and our baptisme; for circumcision was for the males onely, and to be done the eight day; whereas baptisme is both for male and female, to be done at any time, &c, and the ceremonies had in Israell, are now abolished: &c ANSWER. 1. The objection is not of waight: though it be common to others (with the Anabaptists) in other cases, who in this matter see the vanitie of it themselues. For first, as I noted before, we speak onely of such things as are morall in their owne nature, or agree in a generall and perpetuall equity, and in their like common propertie, end, and benefit: and so farre forth are perpetual, how ever there be differences othervvise about some outvvard circumstances, accidents, & other like things, according to the divers dispensation of the Old and New Testament. As may be observed in the Apostles writings, & in the reasons and allegations made therein: which are taken not onely from theOf vvhich see before pag. 5. moral law, but euen from the sha∣dowes and ceremonies of Moses: as may be seen in these places, and the like, Col. 2, 11, 12. with Rom 4, 11, 12. Matth. 5, 23, 24, 25. and 26, 17 — 29. Joh. 1, 29. Act. 1, 14 — 17. Rom. 12, 1. and 15, 4, 16. 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. and 5, 6, 7, 8. and 6, 19, 20. and 9, 13, 14. and 10, 16, 17, 18. Gal. 4, 21 — 31. & 5, 1 — 9 — 13. Phil. 2, 17, & 3.2, 3. 2 Thes. 2, 4. The Epistle to the Hebrewes. 1 Pet. 1, 15, 16, 19. and 2, 5. Jude ver. 23. Rev. 1, 12. and 2, 17. and 3, 5, 12. and 19, 8. and 21, 2, 3. &c. By vvhich may appeare, that although the outward ceremonies themselues be abo∣lished, yet the spirit and equitie of them still remaineth; and that from them (vvhich then vvere had in Israell) vvee should now in the time of the Gospell deriue and fetch reasons, instructions, applications, and dire∣ctions for the churches use and benefit continually: as I shall by and by obserue more particularly. 2. But first let us note to this purpose also the doctrine & phrases used by the Prophets: which may giue further light about the question in hand. As when Esay speaking of the time of the Gospell, calleth the Chri∣stians the brethren of the Jewes, and foretelleth hovv they shall be brought for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations, to Ierusalem the Lords holy mountayne, as the children of Israell bring an offring in a cleane vessell, into the house of the Lord: that the Lord vvill also take of them for Priests and Levites: And that from one New Moone to another, & from one Sabbath to another, al flesh shal come to worship before the Lord. Esa. 66, 18 — 23. And Ieremie the Prophet, Thus saith the Lord, David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel. Neyther shal the Priest, the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to doe sacrifice continually. &c. Jer. 33, 17, 18. &c. And Ezechiels prophecie, from the 40 chap. to the end, treateth of the restauration of the church, kingdome, and people of God by Christ, and so of the consti∣tution of the Christian Church, under the termes and types, of the Tem∣ple, ministerie, vvorship, city, land, common-wealth and kingdome of the Iewes. Ezech. 40— 48. chap. And (to omit other of the Prophets) Zacharie
foretelleth that the nations shall be joyned to the Lord, and shall be his people: Zac.  11. And agayne, that the Gentiles shall come to seeke the Lord of Hosts in Ieru∣salem, and to pray before the Lord: And shall take hold of the skirt of the Jewes, to goe with them. Zach. 8, 22, 23. And shall goe up from yeere to yeere to worship the King, the Lord of Hosts, and to keep the feast of Tabernacles. Also, in that day shall there be upon the bels of the horses, HOLYNES TO THE LORD, and the pottes in the Lords house shalbe like the bowles before the Altar. Yea, everie pot in Ie∣rusalem and in Iudah shalbe Holynes unto the Lord of Hosts, and they that sacrifice shal come and take of them, and seeth therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Ca∣naanite in the house of the Lord of hostes. Zach. 14, 16, 20, 21. And many the like speaches may be observed throughout the Prophets, foretelling the time of the Gospell, with the mercies of God, and our duties therein; vvhich cannot be rightly understood or observed as vve should, vvithout refe∣rence to the ceremonies and state of Israel heretofore. Which also plain∣ly sheweth the abolition of those shadowes and ceremonies to be such, as that yet still the trueth and equitie of them remayneth, & is perpetuall, for the churches instruction, comfort, and direction continually. 3. And now that I am giving some instances out of the Prophets, I wil (before I come to mention also some particulars in the Apostles wri∣tings to like purpose) note yet further (in divers respects) that which the Prophet Amos hath, touching the kingdome of Christ in the Christian Church of the Gospell, vvhen he bringeth in the Lord himself speaking thus, In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David, that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof (or hedge the breaches of them,) and I will raise up his ruines, and I will build it as in the daies of old: that they may possesse the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, vvhich are called by my name, saith the Lord that doth this. Amos 9, 11, 12. Thus prophecied Amos of old. Whose speach, how should it be understood, or these things observed in the Church and kingdome of Christ, built up among the Ievves & Gentiles, in the time of the Go∣spell (whereof the Prophet speaketh) if we should not now look unto David, and to the estate of his house & kingdome, as it vvas heretofore: and still haue relation thereunto, in the Churches constitution, reforma∣tion, ministration, and proceeding: alvvayes endevouring to haue the spirituall trueth, comfort and benefit thereof more and more among us? To which end, all the phrases here used by the Prophet are vvell to be mynded, for the manifold use that may be made thereof. And this Scri∣pture I doe the rather more particularly insist upon, because the Apostles did thus understand and apply it, in a controversie that vvas about cir∣cumcision, in their time: Act. 15, 1 — 17. Where vvhen they disputed, how the Gentiles vvere to be free from circumcision and the yoke of Moses Law (vvhich had before ben as a partition vvall betvveen the Ievves and Gentiles) they both by the vvork of God, and from this Scripture obser∣ved vvithall, hovv now the Lord took out of them a people for his name, as the Prophets had foretold. ver. 14 — 17. And besides the things spoken of Davids tabernacle in both places, note also, hovv vvhere Amos hath, that
the Ievves should possesse the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, upon vvhom the name of the Lord is called, the Apostle Iames (follovving the Septuagints translation) hath it, that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, &c. so teaching, that by the remnant of Edom, vve may understand the residue of men besides the Ievves, (whether nearer unto them, or hostile against them, as the Edomites vvere to the Ievves:) and that vvhen the Gentiles seek after the Lord, and are called by his name, thenObad. v. 19, 20, 21. Psa. 47 3, 4, 9. they become the Ievves possession in Christ, the sonne of David, in vvhom Davids ruinated ta∣bernacle is built agayne, and the breaches of the hedges thereof (vvherevvith it vvas compast about & fenced) be hedged and closed up, and his ruines raised up, and it built and set up, as in the dayes of old, &c. Amos 9, 11, 12. vvith Act. 15, 16, 17. To the same purpose may be observed those many places throughout the Scripture, vvhere it is said, that Christ should sit upon the throne of David. Luke 1, 31, 32, 33. and Act. 2, 30. vvith Psal. 89, 3, 4, 29, 36. and 132, 11. Esa. 16, 5. and 32, 1. Jer. 33, 15 — 26. Dan. 7, 14, 27. Mic. 4, 7. Which being rightly un∣derstood, and spiritually applyed, will not onely minister unto us much instruction and comfort, but vvill also plainly manifest, hovv vve should novv stil haue reference hereunto, in the churches estate, and in the many questions and controversies arising thereabout. Briefly, these things and an hundred the like in the Scriptures, sufficiently teach us, that although vve be freed from Moses ceremonies, yet vve may not be aliens from Is∣raels policie. As the Apostles also taught and shewed the churches con∣tinually. Ephes. 2, 11, 12. vvith Gal. 5, 1 — 13. Phil. 3, 2, 3. and Col. 2, 8 — 17. and the vvhole Epistle to the Hebrevves. 1 Pet. 2, 5 — 10. 2 Pet. 1, 19, 20, 21. Rev. 19, 10. and 21, 2. &c. 4. So then (stil remembring, as I noted erevvhile, that the ceremonies of Moses are in such sort abrogated, & vve freed from the outvvard ob∣servation thereof according to the letter of the Lavv, as yet still the spirit & equitie thereof abideth, & vve stand bound to the observation there∣of accordingly: notvvithstanding the many differences of estate and ad∣ministration, betvveen them and us:) I come now to the Apostles vvri∣tings, to giue some instances also out of them. To name some particu∣lars therefore (to vvhich there is reference in the nevv Testament) as the Tabernacle, and Temple; the Arke, and Mercy seat; the pillars, the can∣dlestick; the Altar of burnt offering, and incense; the Passeover, and con∣tinuall sacrifices, and offrings; the Priests, and their ministration and ser∣vice; the feasts; leven; leprosie; uncleannes by touching the dead, &c. Who knovveth not, that these novv are ceased, and that many great dif∣ferences may be observed hereabout, betvveen them and us, betvveen their infancie and our riper age, betvveene their administration and ours, &c. Yet notvvithstanding there is also the spirituall intendement & use of these, besides the letter, and a perpetuall equity of them: vvhich remayneth novv still for ever: And accordingly doe the Apostles, and all vvriters, both old and nevv, from hence dravv reasons, informations, & applications of them unto us, and our estate novv under the Gospell. As
r example may be seen, touching the tabernacle, and temple, hovv it is plyed to Christ, Ioh. 1, 14. (in the Originall) and 2, 19, 21. Hebr. 8.1, 2. and 9, , 12, 23, 24. Revel. 21, 22. And to the church, in the time of the Gospell, oth the universall, and particular churches, Act. 15, 16, 17. Ephes. 2, 21.  Cor. 3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6, 16. 2 Thes. 2, 4. 1 Pet. 2, 5. Revel. 3, 12. and 11, 1, 2, 19. and 13, 6. and 14, 15, 17. and 15, 5, 6, 8. and 21, 3. and to particular persons,  Cor. 6, 19. 2 Cor. 5, 1 — 4.2 Pet. 1, 13, 14. with Ioh. 2, 19, 22. The like may be observed about the other particulars, vvith the severall uses and applica∣ions made thereof in sundry places: as of the Arke, & Mercie-seat, Rev. 1, 19. and Rom. 3, 25. with Exod 25, 17 — 21. in the Septuagint. The pillars, Rev. , 12. Gal. 2, 9. 1 Tim. 3, 15. The Golden candlesticks, Rev. 1, 12, 13, 20. and 2, , 5. and 11, 4. The Altar of burnt offring, Mat. 5, 23, 24, 25. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14. & 0, 16, 17, 18. Hebr. 13, 10. Rev. 6,9. and 11, 1. and 14, 18. and the Altar of in∣cnse, Rev. 8, 3, 4, 5. and 9, 13. and 14, 18. The Passeover, 1 Cor. 5, 7. with Joh. , 29. 1 Pet. 1, 19. Revel. 13, 8. and other sacrifices and offrings, Mark 9, 49. Ioh. 1, 29, 36. Rom. 12, 1. and 15, 16. Phil. 2, 17. and 4, 18. Hebr. 9, 23, 26. and 10, 2, 26. and 13, 15, 16. 1 Pet. 2, 5. The Priests, and their ministration and ser∣uice, Rom. 15, 16. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14. Hebr. 5, 1 — 5. & 8, 1 — 5. and 10, 12, 21. 1 Pet. , 5, 9. Rev. 1, 6. and 5, 10. and 20, 6. The feasts, 1 Cor. 5, 8. Iude ver. 12. Leven, Matth. 16, 11, 12. Mar. 8, 15. Luke 12, 1. and 13, 21. 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7, 8. Gal. 5, 9. Le∣prosie, and other uncleannes, 1 Cor. 7, 14. 2 Cor. 6, 17. Ephes. 5, 5. Jude ver. 23. Revel. 3, 4. and 16, 13. and 18, 2. Now if from these vve may derive reasons and applications to our selues, vvhy not also from circumcision, notvvith∣standing the differences betvveen them and us: as vve see the Apostle also doeth in this particular likevvise, Col. 2, 11, 12. And in deed, vvhat is there at all, in Moses or the Prophets, from vvhich vve may not novv de∣duce reasons, and receiue information to our selues, for the Churches use and benefit continually: seeing all the Scripture is giuen by inspira∣tion of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousnes, that the Man of God may be perfect, and throughly furnished unto all good vvorks: 2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. with Rom. 15, 4.  Cor. 10, 1 — 11. 2 Pet. 1, 19, 20.21. and Luke 16, 29, 30, 31. 5. Now to come more particularly to the objections here made con∣cerning circumcision: vve are to obserue, that vvhen the Lord appointed he males onely to be circumcised, then vvas the man-child to come of the seed of Abraham, in vvhom all the nations should be blessed. Gen. 17, 10. vvith 2, 3. and 18, 18. and 22, 18. Act. 3, 25. So as this ordinance (of circumcising he males onely) vvas then of exceeding good and great use, for the bet∣er direction, and more confirmation of their faith in Christ. Like as also vvas, the appoynting of a male Lambe, for the Passeover. Exod. 12, 5. and he consecration of the first borne of the males to the Lord, Exod. 13, 12. and Luke 2.23. both vvhich vvere types leading unto Christ. Joh. 1, 29, 36.  Cor. 5, 7. 1 Pet. 1, 19. and Rom. 8, 29. But novv that Christ is come of the eed of Abraham according to the flesh, and hath vvrought for us eter∣al redemption through the blood of his crosse, accomplishing the truth
of those things which were shadowed by the ceremonies of the law: this difference of sex & estate is taken avvay, so as now there is neyther male nor female, Iewe nor Gentile, bond nor free, but we are al one in Christ Iesus. Gal 3, 28. And so now the female is baptized, as well as the male: and included (though not particularly by name expressed) in the com∣mission of Christ. Matth. 28, 18, 19, 20. with Act. 16, 14, 15, 33. Which is also against the Anabaptists: inasmuch as the ministration of the outward signe of Gods covenant, is now (since Christs comming) inlarged: wo∣men being made partakers thereof, which before were not. And so the Anabaptists error & sinne is the greater, that would now straiten the ex∣tent of Gods grace in Christ, denying the signe of Gods covenant to children, whom the Lord appoynted before to be partakers thereof. Gen. 17, 7 — 13. Yea and euen touching the women heretofore (to note it here, by this occasion) though they were not circumcised in their owne per∣sons, yet were they counted among the circumcised of Israell: as may appeare by the speach of Iacobs sonnes to Shechem and Hamor, when they said, We cannot doe this thing, to giue our sister to one that is uncircumcised: for that were a reproach unto us. &c. Gen. 34, 14. And by the saying of Samsons father and mother unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised I hilistines?Zac. 13, 1. Judg. 14, 3. And yet more particularly by the offering of purifica∣tion: vvhich was aswell upon the birth of a daughter, as of a sonne. Levit. 12, 6. and in that there were cleansings, sacrifices for sinne & uncleannes, aswell for women, as for men. Numb. 5, 2, 3, 6, 8, 15. and 15, 27. with Lev. 4, 27, 28. and 5 chap. and 6, 2 — 6. and 13, and 14, chap. and 15, 2, 14, 19, 29. and 16, 6, 17, 33, 34. And in that they might eat of the Passeover: vvhereof no uncir∣cumcised person might eat. Luk. 2, 41 — 51. with Exod. 12, 3, 4, 48. 6. And touching the eight day, vvhich vvas then set for circumcision: first obserue in generall, that as it was the circumstance of time appoin∣ted thereunto, so also the Lord ordeyned that they should keep the Passeover but once a yeere, the fourteenth day of the first moneth. Exod. 12, 6, 14. Num. 9, 1, 2, 3. Deu. 16, 1. Yet vvho would gather thereupon, that we should eyther celebrate the Lords Supper but once a yeere, and that on the four∣teenth day of the first moneth, or that we should leaue it altogether, seeing it is answerable to the Passeover had in Israell, which now is ceased? yet such objections make the Anabaptists, vvhen vve reason from circumci∣sion to baptisme. But now besides this, obserue in particular, hovv it vvas also ceremonial, that the child should remayne seuen dayes uncircumcised: which was so many dayes as the mother should be uncleane upon the birth of a man child: (so teaching and figuring out the originall corru∣ption drawen from our parents:) and that then the circumcision should be the eight day: vvhich vvas the first day after the seuen aforesaid, and so soone as could be after them: thus moreover teaching both the taking avvay of our uncleannes by the Spirit of God, through the blood of Christ, whereunto circumcision then did lead; and having also this mo∣rality
in it, that vve should not defer the time, but so soone as we can nveniently should bring our children, to be partakers of the outward ne of Gods covenant in Christ, Lev. 12, 2, 3. with 15, 19. And so this cir∣cumstance of the time, is plaine against the Anabaptists opinion and pra∣ctise. Besides that still once in eight dayes, a Sabbath vvould passe over them: which was also a signe of sanctification in Israell. Exod 31, 13. Ezech. , 12. And that they had many like ceremoniall observances about the eight day; concerning things to be sacrificed, or persons to be clensed, or consecrated to the Lord: as may be seen, for things to be offered, Exod. , 29, 30. with Lev. 22, 27. Also for persons to be clensed, Lev. 14, 8, 9, 10, 23. and 15, 14, 29. Numb. 6, 10. and consecrated, Lev. 9, 1. with 8, 33, 35. Eze. 43, 27. And yet note this also hereabout, that as the eight day was not to be pre∣vented, but to be expected, for divers respects: so when it was upon just occasion omitted, then it might be had at other times afterward: still taking the first seasonable and convenient time thereunto. As (besides the like to be observed about the Passeover, Numb. 9, 1 — 11.) may be seen touching circumcision it self, in the practise of Israell, vvhen it was omitted many yeeres in the wildernes, by reason of their journeyes. Josh. 5, 2 — 7. And in the example of Abrahams circumcision, & his households, Gen. 17, 24 — 27. and the proselytes of the Gentiles, for themselues, & their children. Exod. 2, 48. Which also is against the Anabaptists in this behalf. 7. Of Israels infancie under the shadowes of the law before the com∣ming of Christ; and of the abolition of those ceremonies by Christ; & s of the difference between their estate and ours; I haue spoken here before, that which may suffice thereabout. Yet for the more clearing thereof, note this withall, out of the Apostles speach to the Galatians, which is much urged by the Anabaptists, and others: Gal. 3, and 4, and 5, p. that the Iewes, before Christ came, vvere kept under the ceremo∣nies, as under a garrison, Gal. 3, 23. as under a School-master, v. 24, 25. & a under Tutors and governours, Galat. 4, 1, 2, 3. And in this respect are counted as children under yeeres, and in bondage. Not but that they had the Gospell and everlasting covenant of Gods grace, with faith and free∣dome of conscience in Christ: and were by him delivered from Sathan, sinne, and condemnation, and made the inheritors of eternall life, aswell as we now. Gal. 3, 8, 17. with Gen. 12, 3, and 17, 7. Ioh. 8, 56. Psa. 110, 1. and 116,  with 2 Cor. 4, 13. Hab. 2, 4 with Rom. 1, 1, 2, 17. and 16, 25, 26. Hebr. 10, 38. Act. 15, 11. Eph. 3, 6. Heb. 4, 2. and 11, chap. and 13, 20. But they were then bound to beare the yoke of many toylesome & chargeable ceremonies: Which yoke is now taken away by the comming of Christ: whom those ceremonies did shadow out, & in vvhom the trueth, body, and substance  them is had. Joh. 1, 16, 17. Act. 15, 10, 11. Gal 3, 8 — 17 — 29. Colos. 2, 16, 17. br. 8, & 9, & 10, & 11, & 12 chap. And in that respect now is this the rches riper age, wherein we haue freedome in Christ Gal. 3, & 4, & 5, . Which I note the rather, because the Anabaptists and others, mista∣g or perverting these things, and so labouring (what they can) to dar∣ken
or oppugne the truth, doe under a vayn pretence of Israels infancie, make frivolous exceptions and answers, when they are pressed vvith rea∣sons and arguments out of Moses and the Prophets. Obserue also, that whereas the Apostle often speaketh of faith, in the place aforesaid (which also is much urged by the Anabaptists) faith is there opposed to the ce∣remonies and works of the lavv. Gal. 3, & 4 chap. Which is vvell to be mynded, that so we may knowe the Apostles meaning aright: who hath no purpose at all (as they would haue it) thereby to exclude young chil∣dren from the covenant of God, or seale thereof: (as the whole scope of the place doth plainely manifest) but indeed to exclude the ceremonies and works of the law, in the case of our justification and salvation by Christ; and to shew how we are freed from that yoke and bondage, un∣der vvhich the Iewes were in the time of the law, which now is abroga∣ted and taken avvay by Christ. For otherwise the Apostles themselues drawe reasons from them, and make applications thereof unto us: so teaching that the truth and equity of them is perpetual notwithstanding as I haue here before shewed in many particulars. OBJECTION VI. But the Iewes that were under the covenant, and circumcised when they were young, were also baptized when they were old: And the Proselytes likewise of the Gentiles. Matth. 3, 5, 6. Act. 2, 5, 10, 41. and 18, 8. ANSWER. 1. Circumcision, besides that it vvas a seale of the covenant of God, was also (in other respect) one of the shadowes and ceremonies of the law, and so (according to the time of the old Testament) was done with blood, and led them still on to the Messiah to come, who was not then exhibited. Lev. 12, 2, 3. with Exod. 4, 26. Whereas Baptisme (agreably to the maner of the new Testament) is without blood, and sealeth unto us the grace of God in Christ, who is now come in the flesh. Ioh. 1, 26, 27, 29. Act. 2, 36, 38, 41. and 8, 36, 37. In which respect it vvas needfull that the Ievves and Proselytes (though circumcised) should also be baptised into the name of Iesus Christ: and so should manifest that now they looked no longer (as before) for the Messiah to come, but beleeved in him that was already come, euen in Iesus Christ, in whom the shadovves of the law had their end and fulnes, and in whom the promises of God are Yea and Amen, to the glory of God by us. So as now both Ievves and Gentiles are compleet in Iesus Christ: & therefore vvere baptised into his name Col. 2, 10— 12, 16, 17. with 2 Cor. 1, 20. and 12, 13. Act. 2, 38, 41. and 8, 36, 37. and 10, 36 — 48. 2. There vvere also many both Iewes and Proselytes, who though they vvere circumcised, yet did not acknowledge Christ now exhibited Luke 7, 29, 30. Act. 2, 40. and 6, 12, 13, 14. and 7 chap. and 13, 45 — 50. & 14, 2 — 5. and 17, 4, 5. and 18, 4, 5, 6. and 19, 8, 9. and 28, 17, 23, 24. Rom. 2, 17 — 29. Rev. 2, 9. and 3, 9. In respect vvhereof, it vvas needful that such of them as beleeved
hrist, should accordingly professe it and so by baptisme be distingui∣d and separated from the other unbeleeving Ievves and Proselytes,  refused Iesus Christ, & yet still gloried in their circumcision. Where∣n moreover the Apostles exhorted the beleeving Ievves and Prose∣lytes, to saue themselues from that untovvard generation. And then they that gladly received the vvord, vvere baptized. Act. 2, 40, 41. and 18, 4 — 8. . Moreover, as there is one body, vvhich hath one baptisme appoin∣ted unto it by the Lord, both for Ievves and Gentiles, and the partition vvall broken dovvne by Iesus Christ, vvho hath made both one in him∣self: so vvas it needfull likevvise in this respect, that the Ievves should be partakers of the same baptisme vvith the Gentiles: and so both of them by one spirit to be baptized into one body, vvhereof Christ is the head: having one hope of their calling, one Lord, one faith, one God and Father of all, vvho is aboue all, and through all, and in us all. 1 Cor. 12, 12, 13. with Ephes. 2.13, 14, 15. and 3, 6. and 4, 4, 5, 6, 15, 16. Whereupon also it follovveth, that seeing the Gentiles are novv of the same body vvith the Ievves, and joynt-partakers of the same promise in Christ, by the Gospel: that there∣fore the children of the Gentiles must novv in Christ be partakers of the seale of his grace, as vvell as the children of the Ievves vvere heretofore. Ephes. 3, 6. with Gen. 17, 7 — 13. and 21, 4. Zach. 2, 11. and 13, 1. Act. 2, 39. & 3, 25. OBJECTION VII. But Christ himself was not baptized, till he was thirtie yeres old. Luk. 3. 21, 22, 23. ANSWER. 1. Yet he was circumcized, vvhen he was but eight dayes old. Luk. 2, 31. Which cometh al to one end, for the poynt in hand: seeing circumcision vvas the seale of Gods covenant, like as baptisme is; and seeing baptisme now is come in stead thereof; as I haue shevved here before. 2, Secondly, their reason is much like, as if they should say thus: Abra∣ham the father of the faithfull vvas not circumcized, till he was ninety & nine yeeres old, Gen. 17, 1 — 24. therefore none then should haue ben cir∣cumcized, till they vvere of yeeres, as Abraham was, nor till they did be∣leeue, and could understand the doctrine and promise of God, as Abra∣ham did. Genes. 15, 5, 6, &c. and 17, 1, 2, &c. with Rom. 4, 11, &c. If they say, that Abraham in his infancy could not be circumcized, because circum∣sion was not then instituted or used; but that when once it was institu∣ted, he took it as soone as he could: let them also obserue the same tou∣ching Christ, that the ordinance of baptisme, for the time of the Gospell now comming on, was not yet instituted or administred by Iohn the Ba∣ptist, vvhen Christ vvas young: and that Iohn the Baptist (the forerunner of Christ, vvhom God sent to baptize) being but half a yeere elder then Christ himself, it could not therefore be that Christ should then be ba∣tized of him in his childhood: Luk. 1, 5, 13, 24, 26, 27, 31, 36, 41. But vvhen Iohn the Baptist had begun his ministration, then Christ came unto him,
to be baptized of him. Luk. 3, 1 — 21. with Matth. 3, 1 — 13. Mark 1, 1 — 9.  thus the example of Christ, being vvell observed, is against themselues also the example of Abraham; teaching us, that as soone as convenient can be, we should be made partakers of baptisme, as Abraham was of cir∣cumcision, & Christ of baptisme by the ministration of Iohn the Baptist. 3. Othervvise if they vvill urge the example of Christ in every thing (for a rule to be followed of us) without consideration of the special rea∣sons and respects to be had concerning him: why then are they not cir∣cumcized, as Christ also was? Luk. 2, 21. why are they baptized before or after they be thirty yeeres old, seeing Christ vvas baptized at that age? Luk. 3, 21, 23, Why haue they not the heauens to open, & the holy Ghost visibly to descend upon them, &c. as Christ had at his baptisme? Luk. 3, 21, 22. Matt. 3, 16, 17. And why doe they not, upon their baptisme received, fast fourty dayes and fourty nights, as Christ did after he was baptized? Luk 4, 1, 2. Matth. 4, 1, 2. If they answer, that these and the like things con∣cerning Christ had their speciall reasons and respects in him, eyther in regard of his person, or of his office and ministration, or the estate of the Church at that time, and the like: and that therefore they are not gene∣rall rules to binde all others thereunto: then they answer their owne ob∣jection themselues, and thus let all men see that the objection is not of waight, for the point of the question in hand. Or if they vvill not thus answer, but vvil make these things be generall rules for all to follow, why doe they not then so vvalk themselues, and why are not these things had and observed among them? The like also may be noted about such acti∣ons and estate of others in the Scripture, as haue their special reasons & respects, differing from the generall rule & course prescribed otherwise. Which being duly observed, vvill much lay open the vanitie of many ob∣jections made to the contrary, in this behalf. 4. And finally obserue herein the strange dealing of the Anabaptists, that urge the example of Christ in such actions, as had their speciall rea∣sons and peculiar respects, as is aforesaid: & yet vvill not regard Christs example in such actions, as he did upon generall and perpetuall grounds, binding all thereunto. As namely, that vvhen litle children vvere brought unto Christ, he took them up in his armes, and layd his hands upon them and blessed them: and that upon this ground, because of such is the kingdome of heauen. Mar 10, 13, 14, 16. Where also note well these tvvo things vvithall: first: that they were litle children, Matt. 19, 13. Mar. 10, 13. vvhom also Luke calleth infants, Luk. 18, 15. Which appeareth the more, in that they were brought and offred to Christ by others, Matt. 19, 13. Mar. 10, 13. Luk. 18, 15. and such as Christ did take up in his armes, Mar. 10, 16. Secondly, that by Christs ovvne testimonie and practise here, litle children are partakers of his spi∣rituall graces, and of the outvvard signes and declarations thereof. Of his spirituall graces, as namely, of his blessing, and the kingdome of heauen. Of out∣ward signes and testimonies thereof, as the imposition of Christs hands upon them, Mar. 10, 13, 14, 16. Yet these actions of Christ, that vvere thus done
a generall and perpetuall ground, warranting also the baptisme of dren, the Anabaptists passe over and contradict in their opinions and tise: and notvvithstanding cease not to urge other actions that vvere e upon special reasons & respects, as vvas shewed here before. Now , is this to understand and use the Scripture aright? Is this the way to ow the example of Christ aright? Or is it not in deed to incurre the leasure & rebuke of Christ, as the disciples did, vvho then vvould not e litle Children to be brought unto Christ; as novv the Anaba∣s vvould not haue them to be baptized into his name? Mar. 10, 13, 14. OBJECTION VIII. But children understand not the mysterie of baptisme. ANSWER. As much as they did the mysterie of Circumcision: vvhereof not∣withstanding they were partakers. Gen. 17, 12. & 21, 4. Exo. 12, 48, 49. Act. 7, 8. . Neyther could litle children and infants understand the mysterie of the kingdome of God, or of Christs blessing of them: whereof they were partakers notvvithstanding. Mar. 10, 13 — 16. 2. Neyther did Peter understadd the mysterie of Christs vvashing his feet: when notwithstanding he was made partaker thereof Ioh. 13, 6, 7. &c. . The Anabaptists themselues understand not aright the mysterie of tisme (as may appeare by their opinions and practise.) By their ovvn son then, they are not rightly partakers thereof. Which let them care∣fully lay to heart. 3. Finally the ground of baptisme (like as of circumcision) is not our understanding, faith, & obedience, as the Anabaptists hold: (which were eak & unperfit ground) but the everlasting covenant of God in Christ, and his gratious acceptance of us thereinto, vvhether Iewes or Gentiles,  or young, &c. (as I haue here before declared at large:) Which is a  and certaine ground: and such as giveth the glorie to the grace of God, and not to the vvork of man: neyther establisheth mans righteous∣ at all, but onely the righteousnes of God in Christ, to the praise of riches of his grace, throughout all generations for ever. 4. nd hitherto of the baptisme of infants, that are the children of the hfull. Of which poynt, and of sundry objections thereabout, I haue ted the more largely: considering hovv great the error is in the de∣ thereof; and hovv greatly it spreadeth both in these parts, and (of ) in our ovvn countrey. CHAPTER II. Touching Originall sinne in Children. He Anabaptists doe not onely deny Baptisme to children, but are  driuen vvithall (for the more strengthning of their errour therein) to
deny that children haue originall sinne, or that it is damnable in the Which is also another notable errour, contrarie to the Scripture & wor of God. 1. Because the Scriptures teach, that man being made at the first, in th image and likenesse of God, that is, in holynes and righteousnes of truth Gen. 1, 26, 27. with Eccles. 7, 29. and Ephes. 4, 24. Col. 3, 10. became sinfull an corrupt by his fall and transgression: Gen. 3, 1 — 7. with Rom. 3, 23. and 5, 1 18, 19. so as aftervvard he begate his children in his ovvne likenesse, afte his ovvne image, that is, unholy and unrighteous, defiled vvith iniquity and subject to vvrath. Gen. 5, 3. with Psal. 51, 5. 1 Cor. 15, 49. Ephes. 2, 3. An here Moses speach, using the terme of begetting, and of Adams begetting sonne in his owne likenesse, is vvell to be observed: as plainely shevving, th vve are corrupted and sinfull from our very birth and generation, & th also ever since the fall and transgression of Adam. Gen. 5, 3. Besides th vve vvere then in the loynes of our first parents, and so in them also vv haue all sinned, Rom. 5, 12, 19. To vvhich purpose, the Apostles speach i another case may be observed, vvhere he saith, that Levi payed tithes i Abraham, because he vvas in the loynes of Abraham his father vvhe Melchisedec mette him: though he vvas not borne yet some generation after that time, Hebr. 7, 9, 10. 2. Moreover the Lords appointing of circumcision to be had in the in fancy; and in the foreskin of the flesh, in the part of generation; & tha also with blood: teacheth likevvise, that children are defiled vvith sinn euen from the birth, being conceived and borne vvith iniquity; and ha need to be clensed therefrom by the blood of Christ. Gen. 17, 11, 12. Exo. 4, 25, 26. Lev. 12, 2, 3, 4. with Psal. 51, 5. Ezech. 16, 6. with Joh. 1, 29. and 1 Ioh. 1, The same is taught and implyed, by the purification of vvomen in Israe after childbirth. Lev. 12 chap. Whereabout note vvithall, thatMark wel the words, how upon conceiving seed, and bringing forth a child, God said, Shee shalbe un∣cleane. if a vvoma conceived seed, and bare a man-child (vvho vvas to be circumcized i his ovvne person) the vvoman vvas uncleane seuen dayes, & was to co¦tinevv in the blood of her purifying three and thirty dayes, Lev. 12, 2, 3. But if she bare a mayd-child, (vvho vvas not to be circumcised in he ovvne person, but included in the males) then the time of her uncleanne and purification vvas doubled, she vvas uncleaue tvvo vveeks, & vvas continevv in the blood of her purifying three-score and six dayes. ver. And after those dayes fulfilled (vvhether it vvere a sonne, or a daughte she vvas to bring to the Priest, a lambe & a pigeon, or tvvo turtle doue for a burnt offring, and a sinne offring. ver. 6, 7, 8. Which shadovves sign¦fied, both the corruption of nature from the vvombe, & our redemptio by grace through the mercy of God in Christ. If any object, that Christ himself vvas circumcised, vvho yet vvas vvith¦out sinne: and that Mary the Mother of Christ conceiving by the ove shadovving of the holy Ghost, and so not defiled by his birth, yet kept al¦so the lavv of purification after childbirth: vve are to obserue, that the vvere divers reasons of using these ceremonies of the lavv, besides the
nifications aforesaid, and other the like. As namely this also for one,  for obedience of the lavv of God, vvho gaue them to his people. And  this respect, both Christ himselfGal. 4, 4. being borne of a vvoman under the avv, and his mother being her self an Israelite, they vvere both of them ound to keep these lavves of God, vvhich vvere giuen unto Israell: and uen also generally, so as in the one there was no exception of any male child that vvas eight dayes old, nor in the other of any vvoman, that rought forth children. Gen. 17, 12. and Lev. 12 chap. And this very reason of the observation of the law of God therein) is in some particulars ex∣pressed by the Euangelist himself, Luk. 2, 21 — 24. Besides that othervvise the like objection might be made touching Christs baptisme; vvhich he also received (not for that he vvas himself defiled vvith sinne, and needed to be clensed therefrom, but) because he would thus fulfill all righteousnes: as he did himself shevve to Iohn the Baptist, vvhenas Iohn made exception thereabout, considering his person and estate. Matt. 3, 13, 14, 15. 3. But to proceed vvith the point in hand, David a Prophet and man of God expressely professeth of himself, that he vvas brought forth in iniquity, and that in sinne his mother conceived him. Psal. 51, 5. Which is also the more to e mynded, because in another Psalme he styleth himself the sonne of Gods handmaid, being an Israelite, borne of beleeving parents, under the cove∣nant of grace: Psal. 86, 16. and yet so acknovvledgeth his naturall corru∣ption, as is aforesaid. And the argument of the Psame doeth yet the more confirme it, in that speaking there, of actual sinnes, and particularly of his adulterie vvith Bathsheba, he noteth the fountaine thereof to haue ben the originall corruption that was in him, defiling the vvhole man. Psal. 51, 4. compared with the title of the Psalme, and ver. 1, 2, &c. Thus teaching us (by his example) alvvay to look, not at our actuall sinnes alone, but at our na∣turall corruption also, as being the bitter fountaine & originall thereof: that so we may aright discerne and acknowledge how corrupt and sinful we are: and be truly humbled in our selues, and giue glorie to God in al his judging of us. ver. 3, 4, 5. Which els we doe not attaine unto aright, as vve should. Whereupon in the next verse after, he calleth it wisdome, to know this corruption of our nature, and to acknovvledge it, & be truly humbled thereby and cast downe in our selues before God. Psal. 51, 6. 4. And the Apostle Paul teacheth the same, when he saith that al, euen the Iewes as vvell as the Gentiles, are by nature the children of wrath. Eph. , 3. He saith not (by imitation) as some would colour it, for more confir∣mation of their error: but by nature (saith he) are we al the children of wrath: that we may know this is naturall and from the birth. Whereupon again otherwhere he calleth our naturall corruption, the old man; and the law of sinne that is in our members; and the sinne that dwelleth in us; and so easily and rea∣ly besettes us about, hanging fast upon us; also, the body of sinne; the body of ath, &c. Rom. 6, 6. and 7, 17, 23, 24. Hebr. 12, 1. 5. And Christ himself also teacheth, that that which is borne of the flesh, is sh. Ioh. 3, 6. And Iob saith, Who can bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane? Not
one Iob 14, 4. Eyther therefore they must say that children are not borne of the flesh, nor that their parents by nature are uncleane: or els they must grant children also to be flesh, and uncleane, by natural generation. 6. Neyther els should Christ onely be exempt from sinne, being con∣ceived of the Virgin, by the overshadowing of the holy Ghost. Luk. 1, 31.35. with Hebr. 4, 15. and 7.26. For by their opinion, all children should be borne without sinne, as well as Christ. And what priviledge then had Christ by his birth after that sort? What then needed it in this behalf, that Christ should be borne of a virgin, & conceived by the holy Ghost comming upon her, & the power of the most high overshadowing her? And why are these things so specially noted, and were so done, concer∣ning Christ, to free him from sinne, and to exempt him from all others: if their opinion were true, that children are not corrupted with originall sinne? 7. How also then is it true, which the Scripture so often teacheth, that all haue sinned, and come short of the glorie of God? Rom. 3, 23. that the Imagination of mans heart is evill from his youth. Gen. 8, 21. that vve are not sufficient of our selues to thinke any thing as of our selues. 2 Cor. 3, 5. that we are dead in trespasses and sinnes. Ephes. 2, 1. that we are insnared, and taken captiue by the Divel at his vvil. 2 Tim. 2, 26. & by nature vvalk in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mynd: Ephes. 2, 3. whereupon moreover our corrupt inclinations, affections, and actions (being fruits of our originall corruption) are called the works of the flesh. Gal. 5, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26. & our mouth, lips, tongues, throat, eyes, hands, feet, and all our members are polluted vvith sinne and iniquity. Psal. 5, 9. and 10, 7. and 14, 2, 3. Esa. 59 3 — 8. Rom. 3, 10— 18. And this taught by the Apostle to be the case both of Iewes, and Gentiles; that every mouth may be stopped, & all the world become guilty before God. Rom. 3, 9 — 19. 8. Finally, how is it that children dye, if they haue no sinne: seeing death entred into the world by sinne, and is the wages thereof? Rom. 5, 12, 21. and 6, 23. And when God brought in the flood upon the world of the ungodly, and none vvere saved but eight persons: shall vve think there were no children in the world, or that the death which came upon them by the flood, was no punishment of sinne? Gen. 6, and 7 chap. with 2 Pet. 2, 5. Likewise at the destruction of Sodome and Gomorrah, vvhen God ray∣ned fire and brimstone from heauen, upon all in those cities. Gen. 19 chap. And at the conspiracy of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, when (besides the fyer, which consumed the two hundred & fiftie men that offred incense the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, & covered the company of Abiram, their wiues, their sonnes, their litle children, and all that apper∣tayned unto them, Num. 16. chap. with Psal. 106, 17, 18. where there is men∣tion of litle children in particular, Numb. 16, 27. Like as there is also, at the slaughter made in Ierusalem, for the abominations done in the midst thereof. Ezec. 9, 1 — 6. And to conclude, if children vvere not through sinne subject to death, yea and to eternall death & condemnation, then should
ey need no Saviour: and why then needed Christ (in respect of them) take part with children of flesh and blood, that through death he might destroy n that had the power of death, that is the Divell: as the Apostle teacheth. Heb.  14. And thus much (by this occasion) touching Originall sinne in chil∣dren. CHAPTER III. Wheher the Baptisme that is received in the apostaticall Churches of Christians, as in the Church of Rome, and the like, is to be renounced & a new to be repeated again, or not. ANother great errour also it is, to think that the baptisme had in the Church of Rome, or other apostate Churches, is not to be regarded, but to be renounced, and another to be received anevv. Which opinion, vvhereupon soever it arise (whether upon the denying of baptisme to children vvhich is used in the Churches aforesaid; or upon other erro∣neous perswasions touching apostate Churches, or the baptisme thereof) certaine it is, and evident by the Scriptures, to be against the vvord and vvill of God, and therefore to be sinfull so to hold or practise. I. Which first may appeare by this, that there is neyther precept, not example, nor other ground in all the Scriptures, either in the Old or Nevv Testament, for renouncing, repeating, nevv requiring or admitting thereof. And therefore such perswasions & new baptismes are not from heauen, but of men. Contrary to the baptisme of Iohn and the Apostles, vvhich was from the Lord. Matt. 21, 25. and 28, 18, 19, 20. Joh. 1, 25 — 33. with Act. 15, 24. Gal. 5, 7, 8. II. Secondly, there is one Baptisme, as there was one Circumcision. And Baptisme had in the apostate churches of Christians, is answerable to cir∣cumcision retayned in Israels apostasie. Now circumcision being once received in the apostasie of Israell, was not repeated again at their retur∣ning to the Lord and leaving of their idolatrous vvayes to serue him ac∣cording to his word: but they that vvere so circumcised, were (vvithout any new circumcision of the flesh) accepted at Ierusalem, and admitted to the Passeover, of vvhich none might eat that was uncircumcised. In like maner also, Baptisme being once received in the apostaticall churches of Christians, is not to be repeated agayn when any so baptised returne un∣to the Lord, and forsake their idolatries, submitting themselues to the truth of the Gospel: but they are (without any new baptizing vvith water to be received of the Churches of Christ and admitted to the Lords sup∣per, vvhereof none may eat being unbaptized. For these examples of Is∣raell, as all other things in the Scriptures written aforetyme, are afore∣vvritten
for our instruction and comfort. Eph. 4, 5. with Gen. 17, 10— 13. Ez 12, 48, 49. 2 Chron. 30 chap. Jer. 9, 26. Hos. 1, 2. Ier. 50, 4, 5, 19, 20. and 51, 5. with Ezech. 16 and 23 chap.

Rom. 11, 15, 16, 28, 29. an everlasting covenant: into vvhich it pleased God to take us vvith Abraham our father, vvhen he made that covenant vvith him & his seed for ever. And as the Lord him∣self, vvho knoweth his works from the beginning,Iudg. 2, 11. &c. 2 King. 13, 23. and 14, 27. 2 Chron. 15, 3, 4. and 30, 6, 7, 8, 9. Jer. 51, 5.

Rev. 18, 4. hath regard unto it in his mercifull dealing concerning his people, in apostaticall Churches and estate; so ought we also our selues carefully to haue respect thereun∣to, in the consideration of baptisme thus received, as in all other things, according to the word of God; and manifold occasions ministred from the Lord. IIII. And seeing Christ dyed to sinne once, & being raysed from the dead, dyeth no more, but liveth to God: And we are buryed vvith him by ba∣ptisme into his death, to be planted with him likevvise to the similitude of his resurrection: therefore also all that are once baptized into his name, ought still to reteine it for continuall use and comfort, and not a∣gayn to repeat it, any more then there is repetition of Christs death and sacrifice once offered to take avvay sinne. Rom. 6, 8 — 11. with ver. 3, 4, 5. and Act. 13, 34. Heb. 7, 27. and 9, 25 — 29. and 10, 10— 14. 1 Pet. 3, 18. Revel. 1, 18. with Matth. 28, 19, 20.

And touching the Church of Rome in particular, it cannot be denyed, but that Church was espoused to Christ in the covenant of grace by the Gospel of salvation, having baptisme with the rest of Christs ordinances, in the Apostles dayes: & hath ever since reteyned it with other grounds of Christian religion, notwithstanding all her adulteries and apostasie whereinto she is fallen. As may be seen both in that Church it self, & all other churches vvhich are the daughters thereof in their constitution, ey∣ther for faith or order, or both, in vvhole or in part. And hereunto (as in Iudahs and Israels apostasies heretofore, so novv) in all cases and questi∣ons of this nature, due respect is alvvay to be had: As may appeare by these Scriptures, Rom. 7, 1, 8. and 6, 3, 4. with Revel. 17 chap. and 18, 4.

VI. They professe Iesus to be the Christ, & to be the sonne of God mani∣ in the flesh, that dyed for the sinnes of the vvorld, that by his sacri∣ and death upon the crosse hath reconciled us unto God, and payed  ood as a full and sufficient raunsome for al our sinnes, Rhem. Annot.  Tim. 2, 5. and 1 Joh. 2, 2. &c. They professe also the articles of the Chri∣ faith, conteyned in the Apostles Creed (as it is commonly called) &  the Nicene, and Athanasius Creed. As appeareth also in the Rhemes Testament,  their notes at the end of the Acts of the Apostles; and in their service booke, &c.  professing this faith, they baptize with water in the Name of the Fa∣ther, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. Which Christ commanded his disci∣ples to doe. Matth. 28, 16, 19. with Act, 8, 36, 37. Therefore the Baptisme re∣ceived among them, is not to be renounced, &c. VII. And vvho can deny (vvith any vvarrant from the vvord of God) the Ievves and Pagans, whom they bring to the faith of Christ aforesaid, and baptize into his name: Who can (I say) with any good reason, deny these novv to be Christians, or not to haue the Lords ordinance of baptisme, vvhich is still to be reteyned, and not a nevv to be gotten or repeated a∣gayne? Like as the straungers and Proselytes of the Gentiles, that came to the faith of Israell in the time of their apostasie, and so vvere circumci∣sed, reteyned still their circumcision, & vvere received in Iudah to eat of the Passeover, together vvith the Israelites themselues: Whereof none might eat that were uncircumcised. 2 Chron. 30, 1 — 11 — 25. with Exod. 12, 48, 49. VIII. The Scripture also teacheth, that God hathRev. 18, 4.  2, 2. and 3, 1. and 4, 1, 2, 12, 15, 16, 17. Mich. 1, 1 — 5 — 13. &c. Ier. 2, 2, &c. E. 16, 2 — 60. and 20, 4 — 44. and 22 and 23 chap. his people in the Romish Baby∣lon, under his covenant of grace: and vvhen he calleth them out from thence, requireth of them not to be partakers of their sinnes: but requireth not to leaue whatsoever is had in the church of Rome. But (as the † Prophets taught & dealt with Israel of old) the childrē of that church should plead vvith their mother, that shee take away her fornications out of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts. NovvMatt. 28, 19. Baptisme is not of her adulteries, but of Christs ordinances; it is not a threshold or post which Antichrist hath brought into the Temple of God, but was set thereinRom. 6, 3, h 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. and Rev. 11 chap. of old by the Lord himself. Neyther may vve plead vvith the Church of Rome, to take it avvay, but that shee put avvay the fornications & corruptions that are of her ovvne addition. Which are the very thingsEzech. 43, 7, 8, 9. and 16 chap. Iudg. 2,  Psal. 106, 35 — 39. Esa. 8, 11, &c. Amos 5, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15. with Rev. 8, & 9,  & 13, 6, 17, & 14 chap. &c. that cause the abo∣mination of her estate, and vvhich vve are bound to leaue & put avvay, and not all vvhatsoever is had in such Apostaticall Churches.
IX. Els by such like reasons as the baptisme is renounced which is the received, men might also urge (as some haue done) not to reteyne, use regard as vve should, the articles of faith, the learning of the scripture the translations thereof, had and acknovvledged in those Church ld  likewise might persvvade to the dissolution of such mariages as haue b had by their Ministerie: vvith other as strange consequences that by  maner of reasoning vvould be inferred thereupon. Which to admitte  vvere contrarie to Deut. 5, 32, 33. and 31, 9 — 13. Prov. 4, 25, 26, 27. and 23, 2 Chro. 29, and 30 chap. Esa. 8, 19, 20. and 34, 16. Luk. 16, 29. Ioh. 5, 39.

A. &c Animad. p. 68 — 72, 71 — 75. the Baptisme had in the Church of Rome, is not true baptisme,  an Idol, and lying signe; a detestable and cursed sacrament; a fiction &  true Christian baptisme;M. Cl. no better then when we wash our own face wi water dayly. Of which sort also the Baptisme of the Church of England  And Circumcision, that was kept in the apostasie of Israell heretofore. ANSWER. Assertions notably erroneous (if not indeed hereticall and blasph¦mous) and such as are not peculiar to the Anabaptists alone, but are so of them affirmed, and some of them also published by others: some sa¦ing one thing, some another; some speaking of one church, some of an¦ther; some to one purpose, some to another; sometimes more plainly directly, sometimes vvith shifts & pretences, more deceiving the simpl and bevvraying their ovvne iniquity. Which is the more lamentable,  as much as these being maine grounds of Anabaptistrie, they shou therefore be convinced and resisted, not coloured or pleaded for by as meanes. For if the former assertions vvere true, then would it necessarie follovv, that the Baptisme received in the Churches aforesaid, is not  ordinance of God, not to be reteyned, but utterly to be rejected, &  baptisme to be received, both for obedience of the commandement  God, and for our ovvne comfort. Reasons shewing, That if the Baptisme of the Church of Rome & England were an Idol and lying signe, &c. then it ought to be renounced, and another to be receyved. I. Because Idols and lying signes and fictions are not of God, but the Divell, who is a lyar, and a Father thereof. Ioh. 8, 44. Rom. 3, 4. II. Neyther can an Idoll and lying signe, or such a baptisme as is more then a dayly vvashing of our owne faces, be the signe and seale Gods true and everlasting covenant, of the righteousnes of faith, and
ashing avvay of our sinnes in the blood of Christ. 2 Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16. .2, 18. 1 Cor. 8, 4. with Rom. 4, 11. and 6, 3, 4. III. The signe in a Sacrament also is that which is outward & visible.  h in Baptisme, is the vvashing with water, in the Name of the Lord.  if this be a fiction, and lying signe, in the Churches aforesaid, then is not the Lords: And they which are there baptized, haue not then the outvvard visible signe, vvhich the Lord hath ordeyned to be had of his people: and therefore are bound to gette it unto them, where it may be ad Rom. 4, 11. and 6, 3, 4. Act. 10, 47, 48. Matt. 3, 11. and 28, 18, 19. with Gen. 1, 11, 12, 13. and 21, 4. IV. And that also is to be done without delay, and before they may come to the Lords Supper: seing the neglect of Baptisme is sinne, as was the neglect of circumcision: and no unbaptized person may eat of the Lords supper, as no uncircumcised person might eate of the passeover. Ephes. 4, 4, 5. and Luke 7, 29, 30. with 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, 18. Exo. 4, 24, 25, 26. and 12, 43, , 48. V. And if any that reteyne an Idoll baptisme, & lying signe and ficti∣on, and haue not the Lords signe of the vvashing away of their sinnes in the blood of Christ; will so presume to come to the Table of the Lord, they doe highly prophane it, and eat judgment unto themselues. 2 Cor. 6, 14, 1, 16. with 1 Cor. 11, 27, 28, 29. and Mal. 1, 7. 2 King. 23, 21. with ver. 4, &c. E 16, 19, 20, 21. Esa. 44, 20. Zach. 10, 2. VI. Yea, seing Baptisme is the badge of Christianitie, will it not also follovv hereupon, that such persons as haue no other outward baptisme, but an Idoll baptisme, and lying signe and fiction, stand outwardly in this behalf Idol and false Christians; and the Ministers among them, Idoll & false Ministers, profaning the holy things which they minister? And that therefore the persons and ministers vvhich so speak and write against the baptisme of the Churches aforesaid, and yet haue no other outvvard ba∣ptisme, but what they received there, are accordingly to be esteemed themselues, untill they revoke their ungodly errours? And moreover,  none vvho haue but an Idol baptisme and lying signe themselues,  such estate minister baptisme or the Lords supper to others, and be accepted or reteyned for the ministers of Christ, without great sinne and Impietie? 2 Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16. with 2 Chron. 29 and 30 chap. Ezra 2, 61, 62,  and 6, 19, 20, 21. Jer. 10, 8. Psal. 115, 4 — 8. 1 Cor. 10, 7, 14. Ioh. 5, 21. Rev. 21, 8. and 2, 15. Zach. 10, 2. and 11, 17. Ezech. 44, 6, 7, 8, 9. VII. Neyther can it be thought, that repentance (vvhich still they speak of) should ever make a lye to be a trueth; an Idoll to be Gods or∣dinance; a lying and cursed signe to be a true and blessed sacrament. For gh repentance fyndeth mercy vvith God for a lye, yet a lye is a lye  and an Idoll vanitie. Zach. 10, 2. Ier. 10, 8. Ioh. 8, 44. and 14, 6. and 17.  with 2 Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16. VIII. Nor doe they indeed repent, who still reteyne such baptisme,  themselues think to be an Idoll, and lying signe and fiction. For true
repentance, and our duty to God, leadeth and byndeth us to cast avvay all Idols, and lying signes and fictions farre from us. Hos. 14, 8. Ezeck. 2 Esa. 30, 22. & 44, 20. 1 Cor. 10, 14. 1 Joh. 5, 21. with Rev. 2, 20, 21, 22. and 9, 20. 14, 9 — 12. And this also (as I noted before) is religiously to be done, afo ever we offer to come to the Lords supper: as they in Israell careful purged the Temple that had ben defiled, and brake dovvne the Idols at idolatrous monuments, afore they would celebrate the Passeover. 2 Chr 29 and 30 chap. 2 King. 23, 3 — 23. with 2 Chron. 34 and 35 chap. IX. Whereas therefore they say,Animad. p. 70. We haue gotten the Lords Baptisme comming to the Lord, in true faith and repentance, vvho baptizeth us vvith the h Ghost and vvith fire. As for the outvvard vvashing vvhich vve had, it need not be peated: &c. And afterward say,pag. 72. We haue renounced that Romish Baptisme, as impure idoll in their abuse, &c. they doe but shift and contradict themselue and deceiue others, and still runne into errors (one after another) mo and more. For, 1. speaking of the Lords baptisme, they speake of that vvhich invvard, vvhereas our question is of that which is outvvard. 2. They speake of abuses in the ministration and opinions of the Min¦sters thereof, wheras our question is of the thing it self, not of the abus 3. Their assertion implyeth, that they had not the Lords baptisme, till t gotte it themselues by comming to the Lord in true faith and repentance. Which plaine Anabaptistrie, and covert Popery, and Arminianisme. Where they debase Gods grace, and exalt mans works. For when they say, th haue gotten the Lords baptisme by true faith and repentance, it must be understoo eyther of the inward, or outward Baptisme. If of the inward, besides th it toucheth not the question (as is aforesaid) it implyeth Popery: if of t outvvard, it conteyneth Anabaptistry. 4. And that moreover so, as if they had dyed themselues in their i¦fancie, they had not then had the Lords baptisme, nor had ben baptiz vvith the Holy Ghost: And as not themselues, so neyther any other i¦fants there baptized. 5. No nor when they were come to yeres, if they had dyed, afore the had left to be members of the church of Rome and England. For som of them left the one, some the other, and all of them haue left both. A holding themAnimad. p. 68.70. 72. 75. 82. 93. 96. ustis. pag. 121, 278, 463. not to be under the covenant of God, nor to haue t Lords baptisme for a signe unto them of his covenant, and a seale of t righteousnes of faith in Iesus Christ: but that he hath broken the cov¦nant euen on his part also, and hath giuen them a bill of divorce, & p them avvay, &c. it vvill follow, that they suppose they did then come the Lord in true faith and repentance, and (as some of them speak it) did the enter into the covenant of God, vvhen they left that estate, and came to th cause vvhich now they professe. And so either they haue no outward b¦ptisme at all (according to their ovvne opinion) confirming the covena of God, and the righteousnes of faith unto them in Christ: or els the had it, before they came under the Lords covenant, and in a Church ¦ced
from the Lord. Let them chuse, which they vvill: and shew hovv r ovvne estate can be warranted by the vvord of God: and how their nions and courses agree with the doctrine of the Scriptures, concer∣g the covenant of God; and the eternity thereof; the sacrament of ba∣ptisme, and the ministration thereof; the mediation of Christ, and the nt thereof; both for confirmation of the covenant, and comfort of the Sacraments, vvhich are giuen and continued by the Lord, as signes and des of his covenant and mercy, in Iesus Christ. 6. And furthermore, by their assertions it vvill follow, that they which are baptized in those churches, and dye in that estate, they haue not the Lords baptisme, being not come to the Lord in true faith & repentance; and withall dye out of the covenant of the Lord, and so out of the estate of salvation, in Churches divorced frō the Lord, which haue not baptisme for a signe of Gods covenant unto them, and a seale of the righteousnes of faith in Iesus Christ. Novv into what a vvofull estate by this meanes they bring all, that are baptized in those Churches, and so dye, not seeing and leaving the corruptions thereof: and what grounds besides they lay of Anabaptistrie herein; let such as are vvise obserue, and let themselues better consider vvith themselues hereafter, & as carefully renounce their vvicked opinions and courses, as they haue rashly runne into them. And the more, novv that they haue ben manifested againe and againe: hovv ever hitherto they would not take heed to the instructions and vvarning giuen unto them. 7. Finally, vvhereas they say, The outward washing need not be repeated; and yet say also, that they haue renounced the Romish baptisme, as an impure Idol in their ase, they use shifts, and contradict themselues. For if the outward ba∣ptisme be an Idol, vvhy doe they reteyn it? If it be not an Idol, why haue they renounced it? That vvhich they speak of their abuse, is a shift, & not to the point in questiō, as I noted before. Difference is to be put between aing that is abused, & betvveen the abuse thereof. The Scriptures are the vvord of God, and not an impure Idol, to be renounced, though they be abused by the Papists and themselues. Wine is the good creature of God, and not an impure thing, to be renounced, though it be abused by drunkards, &c. But of this (God willing) more hereafter. This for the present may suffice to shew the fraud & impiety of their dealing. In comparison whereof, the dealing of the Anabaptists, vvho ding it to be an Idoll and lying signe, doe therefore indeed renounce it and receiue another; is more conscionable and religious: though yet ery deed it be most sinfull and ungodly. For the Baptisme had in the urches aforesaid, vvhich they renounce, is not an Idol and lying signe ction (as they pretend) but is in deed true Baptisme, & the ordinance  he Lord, which in mercy he hath giuen to his church for a signe of his enant, & hath stil continued it in the churches aforsaid, unto this day.  may appear by the reasons here alledged before, against the renoun∣ of that Baptisme, and the receiving of another: and novv also by
these, vvhich here followe agreeably thereunto. Reasons shewing, That the Baptisme of the Church of Rome & England is not an Idol and lying signe, &c. but the Lords ordinance and true baptisme: and therefore may not be renounced, or another receyved. I. Because an Idol, and lying signe, and fiction is an invention of man in the worship of God. Exod. 20, 4. Psal. 106, 36 — 39. Ier. 2, 28. Hos. 13, 2. 1 Cor. 8, 4. and 10, 7. Col. 2, 18, 23. Whereas Baptisme in those Churches is of the holy things of God, a true signe of his covenant, & an institution of the Lord which the Church of Rome had in the Apostles dayes: when Antichrist as yet was not seated there: & hath reteyned it ever since (together with other Churches derived therefrom) notvvithstanding their Apostasie and great impiety other wayes. Rom. 6, 3, 4. with 1, 7. & 2 Thes. 2, 4. Rev. 11, 1, 2, 19. II. Els those Churches & the like, should not haue a mixture of Gods ordinances with their owne inventions, and so haue their thresholds and posts set by the Lords posts and thresholds among them: but should be utterly deprived of all & every one of Gods ordinances: if the Baptisme and other like things among them, were all Idols, lying signes, & fictions But they haue such a mixed estate, as is aforesaid (though some far more then other) like as Israel also had heretofore. As both the Scripture and experience in all ages doeth shew it to be in all such churches. For which see the Scriptures aforesaid, and Ezech. 43, 7, 8. Hos. 7, 8. and 13, 2, 4. Amos 2, 11. and 8, 5. 2 King. 7, 3. 1 Tim. 4, 1, 2, 3. Rev. 8, 7, 9, 11, 12. and 11, 1, 2, &c. III. And if the Baptisme of such churches were in deed an Idol and ly∣ing signe and fiction, a detestable and cursed sacrament, then it should be the sinne of those churches to reteyne that Baptisme still, and their duty presently to cast it away. And we also ought to plead with them, utterly to reject it. For so both they ought to doe with all Idols, lying signes, and inventi∣ons of men, brought into the vvorship of God; and we should also pro∣voke and stirre them up hereunto. Ezech. 20, 7. Esa. 30, 22. Hos. 2, 1, 2. and 13, 2. and 14, 8. 1 Cor. 10, 7, 11, 14. 1 Joh. 5, 21. Rev. 21, 8. Which if either they or we should doe, it would be great sinne and impiety in us all. 2 Chron. 29, 18, 19. with Ier. 50, 28. and 51, 11. 1 King. 19, 10, 14. Ezech. 43, 8. Amos 5, 14, 15. 1 Thes. 5, 21. Rev. 11, 1, 2, 19. with Eccles. 7, 16, 17. When Israell fell into defecti∣on, the Prophets that blamed their idolatries, & exhorted them to leaue all their iniquities, did then also reproue them, for not observing religi∣ously such of the ordinances of God, as were still remaining among them. Amos 8, 5. with 2, 8, 11, 12. and 5, 4, 5. Ier. 17, 21 — 27. with 2, 20— 28. & chap. Ezech. 20, 7. with ver. 12, 13. &c. So farre were they from accounting Gods ordinances reteyned in apostasie, to be Idols and detestable thing. And vvhen reformation vvas made in Iudah, that they returned to the auncient syncerity of the Church: they cast away onely the filth & loth∣some things that were brought into the Temple; and not eyther the
mple it self, or any of the holy things therof that had ben polluted but se they reteyned still, as being the Lords (notwithstanding al their de∣tion) and cleansed them from the pollutions thereof: and such of the sels of the Lord, as had ben cast away in that apostasie, they also pre∣red and sanctified. 2 Chron. 28. with 29, 3 — 12 — 16, 17, 18, 19. These things e written for our learning: and this president may serue, both to direct  in the trueth, and to convince the erroneous opinions, and sinful pra∣ses, vvherein so many goe astray, some on one hand, some on another, ndry vvaies. IV. Baptisme in the defection of Christian churches, is as circumcisi∣on vvas in the apostasie of Israell. But circumcision in that estate was not an Idoll and lying signe, a false or cursed Sacrament: but the Lords ordi∣nance, a true signe, & holy Sacrament, had in Israel before their defecti∣on, and still continued in the time of their apostasie: as hath also come to passe in the Christian church, concerning Baptisme, through the merciful and povverfull work of God. Gen. 17, 7 — 14. and Lev. 12, 2, 3. with 2 King. 13, . 2 Chron. 30 chap. Jer. 9, 26. Ezech. 23 ch. and 32, 24, 26, 29, 30, 32. Also Matt. 28, 18, 19. Rom. 6, 3, 4. with 2 Thes. 2, 4. Rev. 11, 1, 2, 19. Which we ought there∣fore with thanks to acknovvledge and obserue, to the praise of God, and our owne comfort: and not to deny so gracious a work of God, or any way to oppugne it, to the dishonour of his name, and our ovvn unspeak∣able hurt and evill. V. And the Covenant of God is an everlasting covenant; which God continueth and respecteth, euen in the times of apostasie: yea and when he chastiseth the breach and transgression thereof. And therefore in this respect also ought we accordingly to acknowledge circumcision and ba∣ptisme, giuen by the Lord to his people before, and continued stil in their apostasie, to be the Lords ordinances, and his true signes & seales: being assured, that (notvvithstanding the iniquities of his people, yet) the Lord in mercy both continueth his covenant, and euen by this meanes stil cal∣leth and stirreth us up to turne unto him: vvho hath betaken himself to be our God, and into vvhose Name vve are baptized, and doe baptize. Othervvise the ground and continuance of Gods covenant and of the seale thereof, should depend on Mans work and merit, and not freely and vvholly on Gods grace & mercy. Besides that if God brake the covenant on his part, when men break it on theirs, then should there still be a new entring into the covenant again between God and man, and a nevv ba∣ptisme dayly received again, as the signe & seale thereof. Which is clean contrarie to the nature and eternity of the covenant of God, and to the criptures, and the course taken by the Lord, & observed by his people, in such cases, from time to time. Gen. 17, 7 — 13. Deut. 4, 30, 31. & 29, 10— 15. dg. 2, 11, 16, 19, 20, &c. 2 King. 13, 23. Psal. 78, 56 — 65, &c. and 89, 30— 34. and 11, 5, 9. Lev. 26, 15, 25, 42, 45. Ezech. 16, 59 — 63. and 20, 37 — 44. 2 King. 9, 6. and ev. 18, 4. Mat. 16, 16, 17, 18. & 28, 18, 19, 20. Rom. 6, 3, 4. Luk. 1, 54, 55. Heb. 13, 20. VI. If such vvere the baptisme of the Church in Rome, and other
Westerne churches, as is aforesaid, then should it be likewise in the East churches, and in all Churches of the vvorld, vvhen they fall into sinne, breaking the covenant and commandements of God. Yea so it should be among the Anabaptists themselues, & al people in all ages, who sinne dayly, and are continually subject to transgresse against the covenant and precepts of the Lord. And then should baptisme (by their opinion) every vvhere become an Idoll, and a lying signe, and detestable sacrament: and men should day after day still be repeating their baptisme, and taking a nevv one againe and agayn, as vvas noted before. And so should now be revived again the heresie of the Marcionites, Catharists, and other here∣ticks, vvho held that Baptisme was to be repeated again and again, when men fell into sinne. August. de haeres. &c. VII. If the Baptisme had in the churches aforesaid, were in deed a ly∣ing signe and fiction, &c. then vvould it also follow, that there should be no salvation for any members of those churches, reteyning the baptisme there received. For the signe hath reference to the covenant and thing si∣gnified: and so a lying signe must haue respect to a lying covenant, and false thing signified thereby. And by a lying covenant, is no salvation to any. Neither is the covenant of God, a lying covenant, but true and ever∣lasting, and confirmed by the blood of Christ: Vnder vvhich vvhosoever are not, they haue not God to be their God in Christ; and so can haue no salvation in him. Eyther therefore they must grant the Churches & peo∣ple aforesaid, to be under the true covenant of God in Christ, and so the baptisme there had to be the true signe & seale thereof: or els they must deny salvation unto them through the covenant of God cōfirmed in the blood of Christ. Which were most wicked once to think or imagine: and contrarie to the riches of Gods grace, and the vvhole course of the Scri∣ptures throughout. Gen. 17, 7 — 13. with Heb. 13.20. and Luk. 1, 54, 55. Psal. 89, 30— 34. 1 King. 14, 13. and 19.18. with Rom. 11, 1 — 5. 2 King. 9, 6. and 13, 4, 23. Amos 7, 2, 5. Hos. 14, 1. Esa. 60, 3 — 11. Matt. 16, 16, 17, 18. Act. 16, 31. Rom. 5, 8, 9. and 10, 6 — 13. 1 Cor. 15, 3 — 17. Ephes. 3, 14, 15. VIII. Finally, the baptisme of those churches is from heauen, & not of men: and is derived unto us from the Apostles of Christ, through the loynes of the church of Rome, and other churches, which haue from that time reteyned and continued it unto this day. Therefore it is not an Idol and lying signe: but the true sacrament, and ordinance of the Lord. Mat. 21, 21. and 28, 18, 19. with Rom. 6, 3, 4. Heb. 7, 9, 10. 2 Chron. 30 chap. Whereas the other latter washing which the Anabaptists take up a new unto them selues, is of men, and not from heauen: vvhereof they cannot shew vvar∣rant out of the Word of God, nor how it hath ben derived unto them from the Apostles, whom Christ sent into the world to preach his Gos∣pel, and baptise in his Name. In vvhich regard moreover, all such as be∣ing formerly baptized in the churches aforesaid, haue renounced it, and received an other vvashing unto themselues (whereupon alone they would relye) had need to consider well in their hearts, vvhether this be
deed a vvay devised and misconceived of themselues, and in that ct an Idol of their owne invention, and taken up according to their e understanding. Such things was Israel subject to fall into. Which fore Christians now should carefully regard, in this, and other such  of religion. Hos. 13, 1, 2. 1 Cor. 10, 7, 11. OBJECTION II. But baptisme is corruptly administred in the churches aforesaid: as name∣ly, in the Church of Rome, with the signe of the crosse, with exorcisme,Anim∣adv. p. 68. &c. ex∣sation, salt, spittle, oyle, and other mo sinfull additions and corruptions of their owne, as prayer read by the Priest in an unknowen tongue, &c. and in the church of England also with the signe of the crosse, and with prayer read out of a book prescribed by men, &c. Besides that in the church of England, they use the signe of the crosse, for a token that they shall not be ashamed to confesse the fayth of Christ crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner against sinne, the world, and the Divel, &c. And in the church of Rome, they hold that baptisme conferreth grace by the very action done, &c. Therefore in their sinful estate, & abuse of baptisme, it is not unto them Gods ordinance, but an Idol, not true baptisme, but false; not a true sacrament, but a false, and a lying signe, as circumcision also in Israels apostasie was unto them: &c. ANSWER. 1. True it is, that there are great abuses and corruptions in their estate and ministration, and erroneous opinions held by them thereabout. But vvill it therefore follow, that the Baptisme there had, is not Gods ordi∣nance, but an Idol, not true baptisme but false, not a true sacrament but a lying signe, and a fiction? &c. Or will it follovv, because of their errours & corruptions, that therefore the baptisme there had, is to be renounced, and another new one to be received? If so, then hovv wil they plead for the baptisme ministred among themselues, that it should not also be so esteemed, and renounced, in regard of their errors, and the corruptions in their estate & ministration, that are among themselues sundry waies? 2. And how will they shew, that the baptisme there had is in deed an Idol unto them, in their estate and participation thereof? Is every thing that is abused or misapplied by mē, straightway an Idol? or doe they that are baptised bowe downe to it, and vvorship it? Though also if that were done unto it, as vvas unto the Sunne heretofore among the Ievves, why might it not yet still notvvithstanding be true Baptisme and Gods ordi∣nance in it self, as the sunne was the true sunne, and Gods creature (not∣withstanding all their abuse thereof) euen unto them, and in that their , vvhiles they made it an Idol to themselues, & committed idolatrie  unto. Of vvhich point I shall speak more hereafter. In the meane  let it here be observed, that they baptize onely in the Name of the  and vvith acknowledgment of the Articles of the Christian faith:
as in their forme of baptisme may be seen: And as the Martyrs, being ur∣ged about their baptisme received among them, haue alwaies acknovv∣ledged. 3. Hovv also will they proue, that it is a lying signe unto them in their estate: seeing Baptisme (as the other Sacraments both in Israell and un∣der the Gospell) hath this in it to be a signe, by the ordinance & appoint∣ment of God, not at the wil and pleasure of man? And God is the God of trueth, & appointeth no lying signes, but true & holy ones, for his praise and our comfort. Neither can mans iniquitie make Gods signes to be ly∣ing signes: though they may otherwise be abused extremely. Sinful ther∣fore and erroneous it is so to think, if not also blasphemous so to speak. 4. Difference then is to be put betvveen Gods ordinance, and mans corruption; between the baptisme it self, & the maner of administration thereof; betvveen the signe of God, & the errors of men thereabout; be∣tween the sacrament vvhich God hath instituted & giuen to his people, & between the churches estate where it is administred. Gods ordinance, Gods baptisme, Gods signe and sacrament, is holy and so to be acknovv∣ledged: whenas Mans corruption & unlawfull ministration, the churches estate and erroneous opinions thereabout, are sinfull and accordingly to be esteemed. And who dare or can annihilate Gods ordinance, for mans erroneous perswasions, or the churches corrupt ministration thereof? Let these things be distinguished carefully, and the trueth vvill appeare pre∣sently. Othervvise a thousand errors and evils wil ensue, if these differen∣ces be not duly respected, both in this, & in other questions of like sort. 5. About mariage they haue corruptions, errors, & abuses in their e∣state: will they therefore say, that their mariage is not true matrimonie unto them, but an Idoll and lying ordinance? & so make themselues ba∣stards, illegitimate and base borne? Or think they that therefore their mariage should be renounced, and a new mariage, or nevv vviues to be gotte agayne? 1 Tim. 4, 1, 2, 3. 6. Meat and drink, flesh and fish, beare & wine, are dayly much abused unto gluttony and drunkennes; and sundry erroneous opinions also are held thereabout, among them. Besides that the Apostle saith of some, their bellie is their god. Phil. 3, 19. Shal we therefore say, that these things are not the true creatures of God unto them in their estate, but Idols & lying creatures, or accursed and detestable things, &c. 1 Tim. 4.1, 2, 3, 4. 7. Euen about the Bible and the Scriptures themselues also, they haue sundry corruptions, abuses, and errors, among them, in their estate and ministration. Shall vve therefore say, that the Bible is not the true vvord of God, but an Idol & lying book unto them? 2 Tim. 3, 15, 16, 17. 8. Yea and the very terme of abuse, vvhich these men use, doth plainly shevv that it is not indeed an Idoll and lying signe: but onely is abused by them, vvhether idolatrously or otherwise, as by mans corruption hath come to passe vvith Gods ordinances, in all ages of the world. 9. And novv to make it more plain, obserue that it is one thing to say
of this or that thing, that it is not the Lords, but an Idoll, a lye, a detesta∣ble & cursed thing, &c. And another to say, Men make this or that to be unto them an Idol, or a vaine thing and unprofitable: or that they hold this or that errour about it: or doe thus and so abuse it, &c. For the one respecteth the nature or being of the thing according to Gods ordi∣nance; the other respecteth the abuse thereof through mans corruption and iniquitie. The Sunne, Moone and starres (as I noted ere while) were idolatrously abused by the Heathen and Ievves of old: and divers erro∣neous opinions also held thereabout among them. Deu. 4, 19, and 17, 3. with 2 King. 23, 5, 11. Jer. 8, 2. and 44, 17. Should vve therefore say they were not the true creatures of God unto them, but Idols and lying ordinances? Or vvas not God then the Lord of hosts, but of Idols and lying creatures? And had he not still the same sunne, moone, starres and other creatures (vvhich they did sinfully vvorship) to be as armies about him alvvay rea∣die to doe his wil? Or vvere they, because of such abuse, by anie to be re∣nounced, and a nevv sunne, moone, starres, & other creatures to be crea∣ted, and had a fresh: if they had ben able to procure it. Thus againe vve may see that difference is to be put betweene the being or nature of things in themselues, according to the institution of God; and betvveene the corrupt abuse of them, as men make them to be unto themselues, by their idolatrie or other iniquitie, in this or that respect. 10. The Ievves profaned the Temple many vvaies and sundry times: they set Idols and altars up in it, and tables of money chaungers, & seats of them that sold doues: & made it an house of Marchandize, & a denne of thieues, in their abuse thereof. 2 Kin. 16, 10— 16. 2 Cro. 28, 24. and 33, 4, 7▪ Jer. 7, 11. Mar. 11, 15, Joh. 2, 14, 16. Was it not novv therefore the house of God, but an Idoll and lying ordinance unto them? Or ceased it novv to be the Temple of God, because it vvas so profaned and abused by them? Or vvere they now for the abuse thereof utterly to reject it, and to build a nevv one? Did not both the church in former times, and aftervvard Christ himself and his Apostles, and the vvhole church in that age, still hold and use the Temple, as the Lords house, & his sacred ordinance for the service of his Name? 2 King. 19, 14. and 22, 3, 4, 5. 2 Chron. 29, 3, 4, 5. and 34, 8. Mar. 12, 35. Luk. 19, 45, 46, 47. and 21, 37, 38. Ioh. 7, 14. Act. 3, 1. with Esa. 56, 7. The like also may be observed about the Sabbath, and the profana∣tion thereof, in Iudah and in Israel. Neh. 13, 15 — 22. Ier. 17, 21 — 27. Amo. 8, 5. 11. And vvhereas they say, that circumcision was also a lying signe, and false sacrament, to Israell in their defection, hovv doe they proue it? Where doth the Scripture teach it? will they haue us take it on their bare vvord, and be∣leeue that their sayings are Oracles? Or vvill they be wiser and more righteous then God himself:2 Kin. 9, 6. & 13, 22, 23. Hos 4, 6, 12. & 14, 1. A∣mos 7, 2, 5, 15. Mic. 6, 2, 3, &c. with Lev. 26, 25. vvho accounted them still to be his peo∣ple and under his covenant, and himself to be their God: and upon this ground, called them to repentance, and shewed them many favours: and bare vvith them a long time, and aftervvard avenged the quarrell of his covenant upon them, as he had spoken long before? The historie of the
Scriptures, & books of the Prophets, make this matter so plaine, as there is scant any chapter at all, that doeth not manifest these things, and con∣vince their errour. Some particulars I haue shewed heretoforeAdvert. p. 59 — 63. other∣where, and shall novv treat of it further hereafter, in answer of another objection here follovving thereabout. 12. In the meane time, vvhat will they saye to the circumcision of Iudah in their estate of apostasie: vvhen they fell into most wicked Idolatrie: and that not onely of Israels, but euen of the heathens, besides all that they had of their owne most sinfully vvithall. Was Circumcision novv also a∣mong them, none of Gods ordinance, but an Idoll? vvas it not the true sacrament of circumcision, but a false and lying signe, a detestable & cur∣sed sacrament, unto them, in that estate? Were not they now stil the peo∣ple of God? Or had God broken his covenant vvith them on his part, & turned his ordinances into Idols unto them, because of their idolatries and transgressions of his covenant? Was not God still true, and his signes and sacraments, true signes and sacraments still unto them on the Lords behalf; though they vvere become lyers and idolaters themselues? Doth God cease to be true, if man become a lyer? God forbid. Rom. 3, 3, 4. 13. Or haue the Gates of hell more prevayled against the Christian church since Christs comming, then they did or could against the church of the Ievves before his comming in the flesh? Mat. 16, 18. Did not God when once he had giuen his signe of Circumcision, so continue it still through all generations untill the comming of Christ: notwithstanding al the apostasie both of Judah and Israell, that then fel out sundry times? And hath not the Lord done likewise hitherto, and vvill so doe unto the end. concerning the signe of Baptisme, in the Christian church, notwithstand∣ing the apostasies and iniquities fallen out therein? If not, how then also and vvhere, hath the sacrament of baptisme ben continued and derived unto these men them selues, from Christ and his Apostles, unto this day? as I noted here before also to be observed. Or is one and the same ba∣ptisme, in one and the same Church, an Idol and lying signe unto some; and the ordinance of God, & a true signe unto others, that doe there re∣ceiue it? And this also in their infancy? Or when they come to yeeres, can they make that which is an Idol and a lying signe (which is meer va∣nity and of the divell) novv to be unto them the holy ordinance & true signe of the Lord, vvhich he hath giuen and instituted in his church? Ey∣ther therefore it must be acknovvledged to be Gods ordinance and his true signe (though corruptly ministred and abused) or if it be an Idol & lying signe, it is to be rejected, & another baptisme to be obteyned, that is appointed and approved of the Lord. Halting betvveen two opinions pleaseth not God. If it be an Idol and lying signe, it is not the Lords: And if it be the Lords (as vve haue shewed it to be) then it is no idoll or lying signe, but Gods ordinance and true signe, still continued in their corrupt estate and ministration. 14. Neyther doth this hinder, but that in any churches (whether sincere
or apostate) yea in the best that are or ever were, the ordinances of God may become unprofitable unto men by their owne sinnes, circumcision may be made uncircumcision to such as break the law: that is, it may be∣come unprofitable, and be accounted for uncircumcision unto them. Rom. 2, 25, 26. And baptisme therfore in like sort, being novv come in the place thereof. But shall we therefore say, that circumcision, or baptisme, or any other constitutions of God in such Churches unto such persons, are not the Lords ordinances, nor his true signes and sacraments, but Idols and lying signes, detestable and accursed sacraments and constitutions? Take an other instance in the Lords supper. Was the Lords table in the church of Corinth, a table of Divels? or the Lords supper an Idol, and a lying signe and detestable sacrament, to such as eat it unvvorthily? Or vvas it not in deed the Lords ordinance, & his holy Sacrament unto thē, though sinfully abused by them: as is manifest both by the Apostles words, when he calleth it, the not discerning of the Lords body, but becomming guiltie of the body and blood of the Lord: & by the Lords severe chastising of them for this cause. 1 Cor. 11, 27 — 30. Which hovv should it be, if it were not the Lords ordinance unto them, vvhich he had giuen to his church & people? Doth the Scripture so speak of Idols and lying signes any where? Or doth the Lord so punish the neglect or contempt of them? Nay on the contrarie, the Lord severely punisheth the regarding and reteyning of Idols: & the Scripture speaking of them, termeth and esteemeth them to beSee M. Answ. Arrow a∣gainst Ido∣latrie, pag. 13, & 14. things of naught, as it were filths, doung or excrements, lothsome things or detestable, and abo∣minations, vanities, lyes, unprofitable, false-vanities, leasings, and vaine-iniquitie, &c. So far is the Scripture from speaking or esteeming so honourably of them, as it doth of the Sacraments and ordinances of the Lord, though sinfully corrupted and abused. OBJECTION III. ButAnimad. p. 72, &c. Idols are of two sorts: some meerely devised by men, as Ieroboams1 King. 12, 28. calues: some perverted by men from holy signes to Idols, as2 King. 18, 4. the brazen ser∣pent. Both these kinds are in popish baptisme. For their crosses, exor∣cismes, greasings, &c. are Idols of the first sort, worse then Jeroboams bullocks: their washing with water in nomine patris &c. is of the second sort, that is, Gods ordinance turned into an Idoll, as was the brasen Serpent. Thus is there a mixture in Antichrists Christening, of both sorts of abomina∣tions. Therefore haue we renounced that Romish baptisme, as an impure Idol in their abuse, standing up in the place of Christ and his precious blood, which it is not: pretending to giue grace, & wash away sinnes, which it doth not: but it is a lyeEsa. 44 20. in the right hand of all that so receiuett: and the saying of the Apostle is verified in it, an Idol is nothing in the world. 1 Cor. 8, 4. Yet the Apostle is not contrary to the Prophet who sayth, their Idols are silver and gold, the work of mens hands, Psal. 115, 4. An Idoll
then for the matter and workmanship is something, but for the relation unto God, or divine grace, it is nothing: and thus the Apostle meaneth, as his next words shew,1 Cor. 8, 4. there is no other God but one. So popish baptisme, as tou∣ching the material thing is somewhat, the salt, the water, the oyle, are Gods creatures: the outward action is the work of the hands of an Idolatrous priest: and this work remayneth, as did the work of the Idolaters circumcising in Is∣raell: but as touching the relation (which is the mayne thing in a Sacrament) that it should seale up unto them the forgiuenes of sinnes, & (as they blasphe∣mously say) quite take away sinnes, and conferre grace; so it is a vayn Idol & nothing: for neyther doe the true Sacraments in Christs church worke any such effect to Gods owne people: and as for that Antichristian Synagogue, it is not appointed to salvation, but to condemnation by the just sentence of God. Rev. 17, 11. and 18, 8, 20, 21. 2 Thes. 2, 11, 12. Therefore it will not help to say, that baptisme in it self considered, is Christs ordinance: forNum. 21, 8.9. the brazen Serpent was in it self Gods ordinance at first, and a sacramental signe of their redemption byJoh 3, 14 5. Christ: yet they that burnt incense to it, made it an Idol, and therefore as2 King. 18, 4. Nehushtan, (a peece of brasse) it was destroyed. ANSWER. What notable shifts, errors, contradictions, abuse of Scriptures, vayne distinctions, and odious assertions are here couched together? And hovv many in a fevv lynes? Which is the more to be observed, because that novv after the trueth herein manifested, these things are by vvay of op∣position advisedly set downe and published, for the more colouring and defence of the former assertions. So as though for the substance thereof, they agree vvith the former, yet considering the time of the writing and maner of dealing hereabout, they are the more to be regarded & insisted upon. But to speak at large of every particular, vvould be long: they are so very many. I wil therefore giue short instances of each sort: by vvhich the Reader may better discerne, vvhat great abuse and iniquitie there is in such maner of pleas and treatises, how ever covered vvith fair shewes and pretences: which are to common with these and such like Opposites. SHIFTS. Shifts.First then, for Shifts, obserue these: 1. A needles distinction of Idols, nothing helping for the question in hand. 2. Whereas the point here in hand, is, whether the baptisme it self, vvhich is had in the church of Rome, be an Idoll, and not true baptisme: they would now somewhat turne it of, by saying, There are two sorts of Idols, both kinds whereof are in the Popish baptisme. Whereby if they meane, that the baptisme there had, is an Idoll of both sorts, they doe the more increase their error: of vvhich more hereafter: If they meane not so (to wit, that it is not indeed an Idol, but onely that they haue divers sorts of idolatrie in their additions, opinions, & ministratiō thereof) they doe but use shifts.
3. Of which sort is, that they speak of crosses, exorcismes, greasings, and such additions annexed in their ministration of baptisme; whereas we speak of the Baptisme it self. 4. Also that they speak of the abuse, when as our question is of the thing it self, notvvithstanding their sinfull abuses thereabout. 5. The pretending likevvise of the opinions and errors of the Church and Mi∣nisters, vvhen as our question is of the Lords ordinance still continued in the church, notwithstanding those erroneous opinions and corruptions. 6. And vvhen they say, the Romish baptisme in their abuse is a lye in the right hand of all that so receiue it: vvhy is this (so) inserted, but for a shift, seeing they know that people there receiue it usually, vvhen they are infants? And is it a lye then in their right hand? Then must it also be so in their ovvne right hand, that vvere baptized there. Not to speak of the Martyrs and other servants of God, so baptized in that church, for many genera∣tions. So let them answer vvhat they will, here is eyther notorious error and Anabaptistrie (before confuted) or notable shifting, novv treated off. 7. Like are the vaine pretences here made about an idol being nothing in the world: 1 Cor. 8, 4. and yet being something in the matter and workmanshippe thereof. Psal. 115, 4. Like as Bellarmine (though in another case, yet with as yll successe) alledgeth those words of the Apostle saying, Where blessed Paul sayth, we knowe that an Idoll is nothing in the vvorld, there an Idoll is said to be nothing, because that although it be something according to the matter, yet it is no∣thing formally, &c. Bellarm. lib. 2. de eccles. triumph. cap 5. tom. 1. controvers. 7. 8. Also in applying the matter and workmanship of Idols made by the hands of mē, to the matter of baptisme, & work of the priests hāds that doth baptise. 9. And speaking of the relation that is the mayne thing in a Sacrament, they make no mention of a signe, but onely of a seale; neyther therein keep they to the institution of God, as they ought: but tell us vvithall of mens corrupt opinions and blasphemous assertions thereabout, 10. Moreover, when they say, as touching the relation (which is the mayn thing in a sacrament) that it should seale up unto them the forgiuenes of sinnes, & (as they bla∣sphemously say) quite take away sinnes, and confer grace: so it is a vayne idoll and no∣thing: for neyther doe the true Sacraments in Christs Church work any such effect to Gods own people: if they mean, that the true Sacraments in Christs church seale not up to Gods owne people the forgiuenes of sinnes, it is an error: but if they meane that they doe not themselues take away sinnes, & con∣fer grace (for this also they annex with the other) then they use shifts, & keep not to the point of the relation here spoken off, and as it is appointed to be by the Lord himself. 11. From Gods sentence of condemnation touching Antichrist and his adherents, they reason to Gods baptisme, never cōdemned by the Lord, but stil con∣tinued (through his mercie) in the church & Temple of God, vvhere An∣tichrist sitteth. 12. Finally, from the brazen serpent, which vvas but a temporarie & ex∣traordinary signe, the use whereof now also was ceased, when it was thus
perverted, and which now might lawfully be taken avvay and destroyed for ever: they reason to baptisme, which is an ordinary signe perpetually to be had in the church, whose use still continueth (notvvithstanding the er∣rors and abuses had thereabout) and may never be taken away, or de∣stroyed to the ende of the world. And hitherto of these shifts had in this place about this point. ERROVRS. Errours.Secōdly, for errors and false doctrines, note these: 1. That the baptisme had in the church of Rome, is an Idol, and a vaine Idol, and nothing, euentouching the relation, which is the mayn thing in a sacrament, &c. Of which more hereafter. 2. And that whereas Idols are of two sorts, both the kinds are in the popish ba∣ptisme. Is then the baptisme there had, both like to Ieroboams calues, that vvere mans devise; and to the brasen serpent, that from an holy signe was perverted to an Idol, and novv vvas but as Nehushtan a peece of brasse, and so vvas destroyed? If this vvere so, should it not then presently & whol∣ly be taken avvay and destroyed? For so vvas to be done vvith Ierobo∣ams calues, and so vvas done (and that rightly) vvith the brazen Serpent. Yea, and it vvas novv esteemed but as a peece of brasse, as himself here also noteth: and so vvas called by Hezekiah. 2 King. 18, 4. According where∣unto then the baptisme aforesaid should be but esteemed as the dayly vvashing of our ovvn faces or hands with water: as indeed some of them also stick not expressely to affirme. And vvhat is this but very Anabapti∣strie,Pag. 27. &c. here convinced before. And vvhereas they apply the crosses, and exor∣cismes, & the like, to Ieroboams calues, I obserue this also, yet but as a shift: both because our question is of the baptisme it self, and not of the additions made therevvithall, & because that themselues here afterward speaking of the Romish baptisme in their abuse, affirme, that the saying of the Apostle is verified in it, an idoll is nothing in the world. 1 Cor. 8, 4. and compare it vvith the heathens Idols made of gold and silver by the work of mens hands. Psal. 115, 4. vvhere speaking of the matter of baptisme, they mention the water, as wel as the salt, and oyle, there used among thē. Of which more hereafter. 3. Novv also note, that here they say, they haue therefore renounced that Ro∣mish baptisme, as an impure idoll in their abuse, &c. They say not, that they haue onely renounced the abuses, as idolatrous: & kept the baptisme it self, as be∣ing true baptisme and Gods ordinance: but they say expressely, they haue renounced that Romish baptisme, as an impure idoll in their abuse, &c. Which if they haue indeed so done, as they speak, and as was to be done with the Idols whereof they speak. then here againe is notable error & Anabaptistrie. And now then vvhat outward baptisme or sacrament haue they remay∣ning to themselues? (for of it is all our question.) If they say, they haue the baptisme aforesaid, hovv haue they then renounced it, as was to be done with the calues, brazen Serpent, and heathens idols: specially when they say in particular of their washing with water, in nomine patris, &c. that it is as the brazen serpent, which being once Gods ordinance, was turned into an Idol, & there∣fore as a piece of brasse vvas utterly destroyed; yea that it is as the vvork of mens
hands, that made the heathens Idols: Psal. 115, 4. hovv ever againe they crosse themselues, when they also say, that this vvork remayneth, as did the vvork of the Idolaters circumcising in Israel. Of vvhich more in their Contradictions. 4. Note also, that the brasen serpent, was not in deed an Idoll, but an holy ordinance of God, and a sacramentall signe of redemption by Christ (as themselues here afterward acknowledge) which in time came to be ido∣latrously abused. Now difference is to be put betvveen an Idoll, and that which is the Lords ordinance, but idolatrously perverted or abused: as I noted here before. 5. Moreover, the brasen serpent was but a temporarie ordinance of God, in a special case, which being idolatrously abused, might wholly be left & rejected after the speciall use had thereof, vvhereunto it vvas appointed: whereas the Lords ordinance of baptisme, is for ordinarie & perpetual use: and therefore not to be rejected for mens abuses at any time to the end of the world. Matt. 28, 18, 19, 20. So as the comparison also in this respect is unfit and erroneous. 6. That the Romish Baptisme is an impure Idol in their abuse, standing up in the place of Christ & his precious blood, vvhich it is not, pretending to giue grace & vvash avvay sinnes, vvhich it doeth not. But the baptisme of the church of Rome is Gods ordinance, had and planted there by the Apostles, before eyther Antichrist sate there, or the abuses & errors here spoken of, were knowē or had there at all. Rom. 1, 7. vvith 6, 3, 4. Neyther doth the baptisme stand up in the place of Christ and his precious blood, nor pretend to giue grace & vvash avvay sinnes. These are the errors and abuses of men about it, not the nature of the baptisme it self. Othervvise also it should be thus to all that receiue it there, vvhether old or young: And then al that haue received it, ought to renounce it utterly, and to get another outvvard and true baptisme. Or vvill these men say, that we can without sinne reteyne any thing, and not utterly reject it (whatsoever it be) that standeth up in the place of Christ and his precious blood, or that pretendeth to giue grace and wash away our sinnes: vvhich is to be kept intire to the Lord alone, & to the grace of God in Iesus Christ. Moreover, the errors and abuses of men, may hurt themselues, but they cannot chaunge the nature of Gods ordinance in it elf. Mans unbelief cannot make the faith of God of no effect. God is true, though every man be a lyer. Rom. 3, 3, 4. The Ievves in Christs time, and before,Rom. 9, 31, 32. and 10 3, 4. vvith Act. 15, 1. and Gal. 4, 21, &c. holding justification by circumcision and the works of the aw, set these up in the place of Christ and his precious blood, thinking that they had righteousnes and salvation thereby. Should we therefore ay, that circumcision was then an impure Idol in their abuse, standing in the place f Christ and his precious blood, pretending to giue grace, &c. Or should we not ra∣her learne to put difference between Gods ordinance in it self, and be∣vveen mans abuse thereof: stil acknowledging the ordinance of God to e good and holy, although mens abuse and aberrations thereabout be nfull & corrupt: as I haue shevved before. Finally, if the Ievves circum∣ision heretofore became not an Idoll, by these errors & abuses of men:
neyther doth the Christians baptisme become such thereby. Baptisme is novv the signe and seale of Gods covenant, as circumcision vvas of old: and is no more an Idoll, though so abused, then circumcision vvas. 7. That the Romish baptisme is a lye in the right hand of all that receiue it. For confirmation whereof, he alledgeth Esa. 44, 20. Where the Prophet spea∣keth of Idols, thatGal. 4, 7. vvith Esa. 44, 8, 9, 10. &c. by nature are no Gods, but a lye in the right hand of all that haue and reteyne them. Which if it were true of the Romish baptisme, that in the nature thereof, it were no baptisme, but a lye in the right hand of all that haue and reteyn it, then should it without question be renounced as a very Idoll in deed. For such is the lye in the right hand, spoken off by the Prophet, Esa. 44, 20. And the Lord requireth every man thus to doe with Idols, Cast ye avvay, sayth he, every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not your selues vvith the Idols of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. Ezech. 20, 7. Where though the Lord speak in particular of the idols of Egypt, according to the case and estate of his people at that time: yet it is the rule and vvil of God for all Idols: as may appeare both by the reason there annexed, in those vvords, I am the Lord your God, which excludeth the having or retey∣ning of any Idols at any time: & by other Scriptures, forbidding al idols at all times vvheresoever. Ezech. 20, 7, 18. vvith 14, 3, 6. and Lev. 19, 4. Esa. 30, 22. Hos. 13, 2. and 14, 8. 1 Joh. 5, 21. Rev. 22, 15. But here perhaps this man vvill say, his words are not simply of receiving it, but of so receiving it as here is sayd. So in deed he speaketh here: and vvell may it be, that thus he speaketh, to haue a shift and starting hole, after his manner: as I haue no∣ted before. But hovv ever it be, let us yet examine it, & inquire a litle fur∣ther into this matter. And first let him novv syncerely tell us, whether he hold that the Romish baptisme is a lye in the right hand of al that receiue it in the pre∣sent estate of the Church of Rome:Esa. 44, 20 as the Prophet here speaketh of a lye. If he say, Yea: then both this Prophet in the same place, and all the Scripture every vvhere teacheth, that we may not reteyne it, but must utterly reject it: & that els wee feed but on ashes, and haue our hearts deceived, &c. Esa. 44, 20. with 30, 22. Ezec. 14, 6. and 20, 18. Rev. 22, 15. If he say, No: then all may see, how he doeth but shift and cavill, and hath spent many good houres, and blotted a great deal of paper to no purpose, but to maintaine error, Anabaptistrie, & impietie: besides that thus he giues us the cause against himself, and overthrovves al his former assertions & writing hereabout. Secondly, if some should be baptized in the Church of Rome, vvith their crosses, exorcismes, greasings, &c. which he saith are vvorse idols then Jeroboams bullocks: and yet should not set up baptisme in the place of Christ and his pre∣cious blood, thinking it to giue grace and wash away sinnes: let him now also con∣cerning such syncerely tel us, whether the baptisme thus received in that church should be renounced and rejected, or not. If he say, it should: then by this vvill follovv that they hold the baptisme of that church to be an Idol, not onely in respect of this opinion, of standing in Christs place, &c. which here he inserteth, to beare out the matter with greater colour: but in re∣spect of the other corruptions also, viz. their crosses, exorcismes, greasings, &c.
though this other opinion aforesaid be not held therewithall. If he say, it should not be renounced and rejected for these corruptions, but onely for the opinion a∣foresayd: why then doe they hold the baptisme of the church of England to be an Idol, where they know this opinion is not held, to set it up in Christs place, thinking that it giveth grace &c? Why also makes he such pretences a∣bout this matter, by the crosses, exorcismes, greasings, and other such corrupti∣ons in the church of Rome, if he think that the baptisme there had doth not for all these become an Idoll: and yet also saith, that they are vvorse Idols then Ieroboams bullocks? Thirdly, hovv vvill he shew (if he vvere put to it) that baptisme in the church of Rome is so received, as standing in the place of Christ, &c. seeing they are infants usually that receiue it there; conside∣ring alsoOf which see before, p. 29. their profession of Christ, and baptizing with water, in the name of the Father, the sonne, and the holy Ghost: & that this alone is indeed the ba∣ptisme of that church: the other things which he speaketh off, being not the baptisme it self, but erroneous opinions and sinfull addititions there∣about: Fourthly, keeping stil to the Papists opinion, as it is held by them∣selues hereabout (of which I vvill not stand here to treat) let us for bet∣ter finding out of the trueth, admit that some of yeres (not knowing bet∣ter) doe so receiue it as here is said, thinking that it conferreth grace & vvasheth avvay sinnes, &c. yet vvhenas once they are baptized in the Name of the Lord, as is aforesaid, vvith theOf which see before, p. 29. profession that is made of the Christian faith in that church; and shal then afterward perceiue their errors here∣about. let it novv well be considered, vvhether yet notwithstanding the baptisme thus received be in it self an Idoll and a lye to be rejected, or that onely the errors and corruptions brought in by men are to be re∣nounced, and not the baptisme it self: which is Gods ordinance in that church (as circumcision was in Israel) though thus abused & perverted: and seeing that the very ground of baptisme in deed isSee before p. 23. the covenant and promise of God, and not the understanding, much lesse the erroneous understanding and opinions of men. Fiftly, to returne to the points we had in hand, let it be observed, that all vvho are there baptized, doe so re∣ceiue it, as there it is ministred: and that commonly in their infancie: at which time they know not what errour or abuse is held or done therea∣bout. So as if their opinons and abuses make it in deed to be a lye in the right hand of all that so receiue it, as there it is abused & corrupted, thē should all that are so baptized, when they come to yeeres of understanding, ut∣terly renounce it as a meer Idol and a very lye: as the Prophet here tea∣cheth, Esa. 44, 2. Which how strongly it implyeth Anabaptistrie, and sedu∣ceth thereunto, let the vvise and unpartiall judge. Finally, vvhen some of the Iewes and Pagans, comming to be Christians according to the faith of the church of Rome, & makingSee before pag. 29. such profession thereof, as they make themselues, doe thereupon (being not yet further instructed) so receiue baptisme as there it is held and ministred: vvill they now say, that their baptisme so received is a lye in their right hand, as the Prophet speaketh, Esa. 44, 20. and yet haue them still to reteyne the same baptisme: vvhich
if it be unto any, it is unto these and such like, vvho being of yeeres, doe so receiue it, as is aforesaid. Yet the Anabaptists thēselues acknowledge,M. Sm. Character of the beast pag. 49. That if the Papacie did not baptise infants, but onely men confessing their faith & their sinnes, into Christ the Sonne of God, or into the Trinitie, though they reteyned their false ministerie, worship, & government, & other their abominations, yet the baptisme should be true and not to be repeated. Which cannot be, if it vvere a lye in the right hand of al that so receiue it. For hovv should it both be true baptisme, not to be repeated: & yet also be a lye in the right hand, vvhich is to be rejected? Esa. 44, 20. Eyther therefore we must distinguish betvveene the baptisme it self, as it is Gods ordinance, and between the errors & abuses of men that minister and receiue it: to reteyne the one as true and holy; and to renounce the other as false and corrupt: or of necessitie the baptisme must be rejected, and rebaptization admitted. For vvho can reteyne a lye in his right hand, & not sinne? Or who having grace & godlines would liue in such estate as the Prophet speaketh off in the place alledged by themselues. Let this man like it, if he please: The Prophets saying is, He feedeth of ashes, a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soule, nor say, Is there not a lye in my right hand? Esa. 44, 20. 8. That the Romish baptisme is such, as the saying of the Apostle is verified in it, an Idoll is nothing in the world, 1 Cor. 8, 4. that is, as othervvhere he ex∣poundeth it himself,Annot on Psal. 96.5. and 83, 19 a thing of nought: andArrow against I∣dol. p. 13, 14. therefore nothing to be esteemed; also, a lothsome or detestable thing, an abomination; a vanity, a lye, unprofitable, false-vanitie, leasing, and vaine-iniquitie, &c. And if the saying of the Apostle be ve∣rified in it, an Idol is nothing in the world, then it must needs also follow here∣upon, that the baptisme of the church aforesaid hath no relation unto God, nor any divine institution, representation, or signification in it; that it represents no divine thing at all in the vvorld, & so is in deed meer no∣thing, touching any holy significatiō or use to be made thereof. Of which more hereafter. In the meane time now obserue here, that if these things were true, of the baptisme aforesaid, then it ought of necessitie to be re∣jected; euen as the Idols spoken off here by the Apostle, 1 Cor. 8, 4. (compa∣red with chap. 10, 7, 14, 19, 20, 21. Exod. 32, 1, 4, 5, 6, 20.) and in the other places by himselfIbid. otherwhere alledged, Levit. 19, 4. 1 Chron. 16, 26. Ezech. 7, 20. and 11, 21. and 20, 7, 8. Jer. 2, 8, 11. and 13, 25. and 14, 22. and 16, 19. and 18, 15. and 32, 34. Hos. 4, 15. and 10, 8. Which agayn is grosse Anabaptistrie, joyned with notorious blasphemie. 9. That vvater (the materiall thing) in popish baptisme, is as the gold and silver (that is the matter) of the Idols, spoken off, Psal 115, 4. Whereas the use of wa∣ter in baptisme is appointed by the Lord, and still to be reteyned: Ioh. 1, 33. vvith Matt. 3, 11, 16. and 28, 19. Act. 8, 36. and 10, 47. but the use of gold and silver for Idols is forbidden by the Lord, & utterly to be abandoned. Exo. 20, 23. Deu. 7, 25, 26. & 12, 3. 1 Chro. 14, 12. vvith Psa. 115, 4 — 8. & 135, 15-18. 10. That the outvvard action and vvork of the Priests hands that baptizeth, is as the vvork of the mens hands that make the Idols spoken off, Psal. 115, 4. But this is a vvork of hethenish idolatrie, utterly to be defaced? whereas the other
is a work of Christian baptisme, still to be reteyned and continued. To which ende let here also be observed, hovv they blame the comparing of the church of Rome in their defection, with Apostate Israel, becauseAnimad. p. 48. the holy Ghost com∣pareth Antichrists church with theRev. 11, 2, 8. and 17, 5. Gentiles, euen the most vile, the Sodomites, Egypti∣ans, Babylonians, and heathen Romans. Like as the Anabaptists themselues also (disputing against the baptisme of the church of Rome and England, and excepting against the reason taken frō the circumcision of Israel) alledge thatM. Sm. Charact. p. 48. the Apostasie of Antichrist is deeper then the apostasie of Israell, because Anti∣christians are not called Israelites, but Babylonians, Egyptians, Sodomites, Gentiles, in the Revelation: Whereby the holy spirit of wisdome giveth us to conceiue, that he doeth account the apostasie equal to Paganisme it self, yea to the very worst kind of Paganisme. Whereupon these doe utterly disclayme both the Baptisme it self of the Church of Rome, and the comparing of it vvith the circumcision kept in apostate Israel: how ever the other aforesaid, (not vvithout contradicti∣on to themselues in this place and their other assertions) say here, that the work of the hands of the Idolatrous priest who baptizeth, doth remaine, as did the work of the Idolaters circumcising in Israell. Which how can it be, if the matter and work of baptisme (the water, & outward action of the Priests hands ba∣ptizing) be like the matter & vvorkmanship of the Idols, spoken of Psal. 115, 4. Of which more hereafter in their contradictions. 11. Touching the relation (which is the maine thing in a Sacrament) that it should seale up unto them the forgiuenes of sinnes, &c. so it is a vaine idol & nothing. But ob∣serue here first, that the Sacraments in their relation are not onely seales, but signes also. Gen. 17, 11. Rom. 4, 11. As themselues writing otherwhere of circumcision, say,Annot. in Gen. 17, 11. it is a signe or token, which sheweth one thing to the eye, ano∣ther to the mynd. Novv (by their assertion here) the Baptisme aforesaid sheweth nothing at all to the mynd: and so it is a vayn Idoll, and nothing: & that which it shevveth to the eye, is but as the gold and silver of the heathens I∣dols, Psa. 115, 4. Which if it vvere true, then in deed here should be nothing of Gods ordinance, nothing of a true Sacrament, no true baptisme, but an Idol. And can they then blame the Anabaptists, that renounce it whol∣ly; and get another, vvhich (they think) hath the relation of a Sacrament in it? Moreover in the place aforesaid they say further, thatIbid. the Apostle calleth the signe also a seale, Rom. 4, 11. which serveth for assurance of the thing signified. And so the Hebrew doctors use the phrase of sealing their ofspring with the signe of the holy covenant. Maymon. in Misn. treatise of Circumcision. chap. 3. S. 3. But here they teach that this is not a seale vvhich serveth the receivers for assurance of the thing signified: and so it is a vayn Idol & nothing. Besides that by this it wil follow (as these also hold) that they are not under the covenāt of God, but di∣vorced from the Lord, and so indeed vvithout all hope of salvation, in that e∣state. For if any of them dying in that estate, be saved, then it must needs be that God is their God, and they his in Christ; and consequently that they are under the covenant of God: So as then the relation (which is the mayn thing in the Sacrament) may be found in their baptisme, to seale up unto them the forgiuenes of sinnes: And so it is not then a vayn Idol & nothing:
vvhich here they affirme. If they think to help it out, vvith that clause of not sealing up unto them the forgiuenes of sinnes: let them (besides that vvhich is saidPag. 37. &c. in the ansvver of the former objection) consider vvith themselues, vvhether they think that the baptisme receiued in the truest & best churches, do seale up to hypocrites the forgiuenes of their sinnes. And if they think not, whether there they will say, that the baptisme of those churches, hath not the relation, which is the maine thing in a Sacrament? It is generally held,Act. 8, 13. &c. that Simon Magus, vvho was baptised by Philip the Euan∣gelist, was an hypocrite, & that his baptisme did not seal up (as here they understand sealing up) unto him the forgiuenes of his sinnes: wil they there∣fore say, that the baptisme ministred by the Euangelists, had not the relati∣on, which is the mayne thing in a Sacrament? Besides that thus the relation of the Sacraments should depend vvholly upon man,P. 23. &c. and Ad∣vertis. pag. 59, &c. and not upon the Lord, or his ordinance at all: as I haue shewed here before. But to speak of the church of Rome in particular: I aske, whether the baptisme had in that church, seale up the forgiuenes of sinnes unto any of thē that receiue it, or to none at all. If they say, that it sealeth this to some of them: then their as∣sertions here are untrue and erroneous, and the consequents here before deduced thereabout stand firme against them, and this clause helpeth thē not to shift it of. If they say, to none at all, then neyther to any infants there baptized, and so dying; nor to those that being of yeeres, leaue the estate of that church: & so not to those among these men thēselues, that were there baptized. Now if that baptisme there received, do not as touching the relation (vvhich is the mayn thing in a sacrament,) seale up unto them the forgiue∣nes of their sinnes, what other sacrament of baptisme haue they that doth it? Any other, or none at al? If an other, then they are Anabaptists, whose error and iniquitie is shewed before. If no other but it, then eyther they must graunt that the baptisme there received hath the relatiō of a sacrament, to seale up unto them the forgiuenes of sinnes, or that as yet they haue none at all that doth it; but must now get it to themselues: and that also before they may partake of the Lords supper, as was shewed before. And thus every way they fall into Anabaptistrie, and so into notable error: besides that novv in the meane time they stand Idolaters (and so must be content to be esteemed) if the baptisme which they haue received, and still reteyne, haue not the relation of a sacrament unto thē, but be a vayn Idol & nothing. 12. As it is a notorious error in the Papists, to say (as here he noteth) that baptisme doth quite take away sinnes, and conferre grace: so these men also themselues erre not a litle, when they say, that the baptisme (vvhich is re∣teined and received in that Church) hath not the relation of a Sacrament unto them, but is a vayne idoll and nothing, because they say of it, that it quite taketh awaye sinnes, &c. Shall mens erroneous sayings or opinions make a nullitie of Gods ordinances, of his signes, seales and sacraments? Cannot God be true, though they be lyers? Cannot God continew his own signes & or∣dinances, though there be error and corruption in the churches therea∣bout? Cannot Gods trueth & sacrament stand on his part, though men
doe erre and transgresse on theirs? Doth Gods signe and seale loose the relation, and become an Idoll and nothing, if man fall into error & sinne concerning it?Annot. on Gen. 17, 11. What then shall vve think eyther of that opinion of the Ievves touching circumcision, which himself othervvhere noteth, how they say, that at what time a man is sealed with this holy seale of this signe (of cir∣cumcision) thenceforth he seeth the holy blessed God properly, and the holy soule is united with him. Zohar. treating on Gen. 17, 11. or of that opinion touching the righteousnes of works, whereabout the Apostle testifieth, that they sought for righteousnes, by the works of the Law: and so being ignorant of Gods righteousnes, & going about to establish their own righteousnes, submitted not themselues to the righ∣teousnes of God. Rom. 9, 31, 32. and 10, 3. Now that among the vvorks of the Law, they also intended Circumcision for one particular, may appeare both by the strait urging of it (euen in the time of the Gospell) upon the Chri∣stians of the Gentiles, when certaine men which came down from Iudea to Antioch, taught the brethren, saying, Except ye be circumcised after the ma∣ner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. Act. 15, 1. and by the Apostles particular na∣ming of it, in his refuting of this erroneous opiniō about the vvorks of the Lavv. Gal. 5, 2, 3. Shal we therefore think, that circumcision in Israel (while it vvas in use by the Lavv of God) was not indeed the Lords ordinance, nor had the relation of a sacrament unto them, but vvas a vayn idoll and nothing, because of these or other such like assertions and opinions then had thereabout? What also vvil they say to the baptisme of the church of England: where they knovv the popish assertion vvhereof they speake is rejected? will they graunt that the baptisme there received, hath the re∣lation, which is the mayn thing in a Sacrament, to seale up unto them the forgiuenes of sinnes, and that it is not a vayn idoll and nothing, but the Lords true baptisme and sacrament unto them? Let them novv vvel bethink themselues, what they haue said heretofore, and vvhat they say hereafter, concerning this matter. Finally, besides the relation in a sacrament, there is also to be re∣garded, the commandement of God, vvho hath appointed it to be obser∣ved in the church. According as vve read that Christ, vvho vvas without sinne (and so needed not for himself in that respect this relation of the sa∣crament, to seale up unto him the forgiuenes of his sinnes) yet in obedi∣ence of the Lavv, under which he was borne, and to fulfil al righteousnes (being now also our suerty and redeemer) vvas himself both circumcised and baptized. Mat. 3, 13, 15. Luk. 2, 21. and 3, 21, 22. So as in this respect also, baptisme is still to be observed and acknovvledged. And therefore as it had ben (euen in this behalf) sinne in Israel & Iudah (when they vvere in their deepest defections) to haue rejected circumcisiō, & not to haue used it at all: so should it now be sinne in the church of Rome, if they should reject baptisme, and not keep it. Which againe doth plainly evince, that it is not a vayn idoll and nothing (for then it vvere not sinne, but their duetie, utterly to cast it avvay, and not to keep it at all:) but that it is the Lords ordinance, his baptisme and sacrament; which we ought so to esteem & acknowledge, notwithstanding that both the ministration of it be sinfully
corrupted among them, and themselues be erroneously perswaded in di∣vers things thereabout. 13. And now by these things also may appear, what an error it is, whē they say, that it wil not help, to distinguish between baptisme in it self considered, as Gods ordinance: and betvveen the corruptions and idolatrous abuse thereof: be∣cause the brazen serpent being in it self Gods ordinance at first, and a sacramental signe of their redemption by Christ, yet when they burnt incense to it, & made it an Idol, vvas therefore destroyed as Nehushtan, a peece of brasse. Which is as if they should say, it vvould not help to put difference between the Sunne, in it self con∣sidered as Gods creature, and between the idolatrous abuse thereof: Or, between the Bible, in it self considered as Gods word and ordinance; and between the Idolatrous abuse thereof, &c. because the brasen serpent be∣ing at first Gods ordinance, and afterward idolatrously abused, vvas de∣stroyed as a peece of brasse. Or, as if there were no difference between baptisme, vvhich is an ordinarie and perpetuall institution of God; and the brasen serpent, which vvas an extraordinarie and temporarie ordinance of the Lord. Or, that baptisme should utterly be rejected, as being no better then the commō washing of our hands with water, like as the brazē serpent was de∣stroyed as a peece of brasse, after the idolatrous abuse therof. How strongly these things savour of Anabaptisme, & may seduce thereto, let al obserue. And hitherto of these errors, had in this place, about the point aforesaid. CONTRADICTIONS. Thirdly, for contradictions, mark these particulars: 1. When they say, there be two sorts of Idols,Contradi∣ctions. some meerely devised by men, as Jeroboams calues, some per∣verted by men from holy signes to Idols, as the brasen serpent, which being made an Idol, was destroyed as a peece of brasse: and both these kinds are in popish baptisme: And therefore they haue renounced that Romish baptisme, as an impure Idoll in their abuse, &c. Whether they meane, that they haue renounced it, as the calues, or as the brasen serpent, or as both of them (as they say both sorts of Idols and obominations are in it) yet they contradict themselues, when they say afterward, that the work of the Priests baptizing remayneth, as did the vvork of the Idolaters circumcising in Israell. For this remayned so, as it had ben sinne for them to renounce it, and to gather their uncircumcision a∣gaine: and vvith this also they did and might come to the Passeover, as circumcised persons: vvhereas it was not their sinne, but their duetie, to renounce all idols, and to destroy them, and leaue all idolatrie: and this also, before they came to the Passeover. For which see the histories recor∣ded, touching the abolition of idolatrie, & observation of the Passeover, both in Hezekias and Iosias time, 2 Chron. 29, and 30, & 34, & 35 chapt. with 2 King. 18, 3, 4. and 23, 1 — 23. Now to renounce, and to reteyne, are contra∣ries: to remayn, and to be destroyed, are contradictorie the one unto the other. Or if they say they speak but of some abuse, & meane not, that they haue renounced the baptisme aforesaid as an impure Idol: then besides their shift∣ing noted before, to vvhat purpose is it (when our question is about the baptisme, vvhether it be an Idoll or not) to tell us that there be tvvo sorts of
dols, &c. and both the sorts are in popish baptisme,Esa. 44, 20. and that therefore they haue re∣ounced it as an impure Idoll in their abuse, &c. Yea, that the Romish baptisme is † a ye in their right hand, &c. and that the saying of the Apostle is verified in it, an Idoll  nothing in the world. 1 Cor. 8, 4. For if so it were, then in deed it ought to be renounced as a lye and an Idoll, and not to remayne, as the circumcision n Israell did. 2. Againe, one while they say, that in popish baptisme the washing vvith vva∣ter in nomine patris &c. is an holy signe turned into an idol, as vvas the brazen serpent, vvhich in it self vvas Gods ordinance at first, and a sacramental signe of redemption by Christ: Another vvhile they say, that in popish baptisme, both the vvater is as the gold and silver of the heathen Idols, and the outvvard action or vvork of the Idola∣rous priests hands that baptizeth, is as the vvorkmanship of the mens hands, that made the Idols, spoken of, Psal. 115, 4. and as touching the relation of a sacrament, it is a vayn idoll and nothing, as were the heathen idols whereof the Apostle saith, an idol  nothing in the vvorld, 1 Cor. 8, 4. Which though for the matter and vvorkmanship, it be something, yet for the relation unto God, or divine grace, it is nothing: & as other∣where alsoArrovv against Idol. p. 13, 14. they speak of Idols, that they are things of naught, because they aue nothing of that vvhich fooles think they haue: and are therefore nothing to be esteemed, seeing an Idol is nothing in the vvorld, as the Apostle saith 1 Cor. 8, 4. 3. So one vvhile they make as if the baptisme of the church of Rome (where∣about our question is) were like the calues of Israel, & heathens Idols; neither of vvhich vvere ever ordeyned by God, and both of which were utterly to be destroyed: another while they make as if it were like Israels circumcision, which was Gods ordinance, remayning still in their apostasie, & not at all to be rejected. 4. Here they say, that the priests vvork vvhich baptizeth, doth remaine, as did the vvork of the Idolaters circumcising in Israel. YetAnimad. p. 84, 102. 103. a litle after in the same trea∣tise, they mislike in us, and except against the comparing of the church of Rome vvith Apostate Israel: yea; albeit that here themselues compare that chur∣ches baptisme vvith the calues of Israel, & vvith the Ievves brazen serpent, yea euen with Israels circumcision. Other contradictions, that might be observed by conference of their assertions otherwhere, I vvill not here insist upon Let these suffice for the present. ABVSE OF SCRIPTVRES. Fourthly, for abuse of the Scriptures here alledged,Abuse of Scriptures. that may now also evidently appeare by the errors and other particulars before noted. For although there be many devises of men sinfully annexed to baptisme in the church of Rome, & some wicked opinions erroneously held concer∣ning it among them: yet baptisme bothRom. 6, 3. was there, as Gods ordinance, before these corruptions and errors; and so hath ben continued in that church to this day; and ought also still to be reteyned: the corruptions nely and the errors being renounced & rejected. So then the baptisme ere had (vvhereabout our question is) neither is like Ieroboams calues oken off, 1 King. 12, 28. nor is an extraordinarie and temporarie signe,1 King. 12.28. as was the brazen serpent; nor is to be renounced, as the brasen serpent
was destroyed,2 King. 18 4. for idolatrous abuse; nor to be esteemed as the common washing of our face vvith vvater, as the brasen serpent was accounted & called Nehushtan, a peece of brasse: as is said, in 2 Kin. 18, 4. Esa. 44, 202. And for the saying of the Prophet, Esa. 44, 20. if the Romish baptisme be as the lye in the right hand there spoken of, then should it not onely be a vayne Idol of mans devising, and utterly to be rejected of all that haue so received it, as there it is ministred: but also til it were so renoun∣ced, vve might say of everie such a one, as there the Prophet saith, He fee∣deth of ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soule, nor say, Is there not a lye in my right hand? Esa. 44, 20. The sinfull iniquitie of which Anabaptistrie, is alreadie declared before. Which also convinceth the abuse of this Scripture, and other like allegations of theirs here and othervvhere. 3. So when they stick not to affirme, that in the Romish baptisme the saying of the Apostle is verified, an Idoll is nothing in the vvorld, 1 Cor. 8, 4. how extreemly again doth he abuse the Scripture?1 Cor. 8, 4. And how truly is the Apostles saying verified in themselues, that they vvaxe vvorse and vvorse, de∣ceiving and being deceived? 2 Tim. 3, 13. And yet further, vvhen vvith this, they compare that which is written of the heathens idols, Psal. 115, 4. their Idols are silver and gold,Psa. 115, 4. the vvork of mens hands, applying this also to the baptisme aforesaid most ungodly and deceitfully: as may appeare by their owne vvords, and by the shifts, errors, and contradictions, noted out of them here before. And mark how this Scripture is thus compared with the o∣ther of 1 Cor. 8, 4. to shew by these two joyned together, that as an Idol, so popish baptisme, for the matter and work is something, but for the re∣lation unto God, for mysticall or spirituall representation, signification, confirmation, sealing, obligation, or the like, it is nothing, yea, so it is a vayne Idoll and nothing? Which hovv like is it to that ofLib. 2. de Eccles. tri∣umph. &c. cap. 5, tom. 1. contr. 7. Bellarmine, which I noted here a litle before in his Shifts, vvhere he alledging this saying of the Apostle, We knovv that an Idoll is nothing in the vvorld, 1 Cor. 8. saith, that here an Idol is sayd to be nothing, because that although it be something ac∣cording to the matter, yet it is nothing formally; seeing it representeth that vvhich is no∣thing, & therfore neyther doth truly represent, neyther consequently is in deed. Where yet note this difference withall, that Bellarmine alledgeth this Scripture, to shew (if he could) that the images had in the church of Rome, (which are Idols, yet) are no Idols indeed: And he here alledgeth the same Scri∣pture, to shevv (if he could) that the baptisme had in the church of Rome (vvhich is not an Idol, yet) is an Idol & nothing in the world: & this euer touching the relation also, which is the mayn thing in the Sacrament: as he like∣wise saith. And whereas to haue some colour, he ānexeth, that the Apostle when he saith, An idol is nothing in the world, yet is not contrarie to the Pro∣phet who saith, Their Idols are silver and Gold, the work of mens hands, what maner of reasoning is this, but as if now some other would rise up, and say, Neyther is the Prophet contrarie to himself in the same place, when he sayth, They that make the Idols are like unto them, & so is everie one that trustet
them, Psal. 115, 8. compared with ver. 4, 5, 6, 7. for though the makers of them e not made of gold and silver, as the Idols be, and though they haue mouthes, eyes, eares, noses and hands, that can speak, see, heare, smell, and handle, vvhich the Idols can not: yet they are notwithstanding spiritually brutish, foolish, vayne, blind and senselesse; and so are like the Idols: as o∣ther Scriptures teach us to understand this saying here, Ier. 10, 8, 14. and 51, 17, 18. Esa. 41, 29. and 44, 9 — 20. Hab. 2, 18. Zach. 10, 2. And what were this to the purpose, about the question and matter in hand? 4. The other Scriptures here alledged, namely Rev. 17, 11. & 18, 8, 20, 21.Reu. 17, 11 & 18, 8, 20, 21. 2 Thes. 2, 11, 12.  Thes. 2, 11, 12. although they be true of Antichrist, with his adherents & apostasie, and of the mysticall Babylon: and so may fitly be applyed to the man of sinne & to the mysterie of Babylon, with al that lawles estate and iniquitie there spoken off: yet touching the question of Baptisme novv in hand, they are vainely alledged, and much abused. For difference is to be put between Antichrists apostasie; and Gods ordinances therein reteyned, (though corruptly used, and mixed with their ovvne inventi∣ons:) 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. with Ezech. 43, 7, 8. betvveen the man of sinne; and the Temple of God, vvherein he sitteth: 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. betvveen the Gentiles; & the court of the Temple, with the holy city, giuen them to tread there∣on, for a time appointed. Rev. 11, 2. betvveen Babylon (the empiring city of Rome, vvith the Babylonish estate thereof;) and the people of God, vvhom he calleth and bringeth from thence, as he did his people of old out from Babylon of the Chaldeans, and Lot out of Sodom. Rev. 17, 3, 4, 5, , 18. and 18, 2, 4, 5, 19, 20, 21, with Esa. 48, 20. Ier. 50, 8, 28. and 51, 6, 7, 8, 11, 45. Zach. 2, 6, 7. and Gen. 19, 12 — 16. with Rev. 11, 8. Antichrist, with his apostasie, shalbe consumed. His adherents being strongly deluded to beleeue lyes, and not beleeving the trueth, but taking pleasure in unrighteousnes, shal∣be damned the Beast shall goe into perdition: and Babylon, the great city shalbe burnt vvith fier, and throvven dovvne vvith violence, & found no more, as the holy Apostles and Prophets haue foretold: As may be seen in the Scriptures and chapters here alledged, 2 Thes. 2, 3, 8, 11, 12. Rev. 17, 11. and 18, 2, 8, 18, 20, 21. compared with Ier. 50, and 51. Esa. 13, and 14, & 1, 1 — 10. and 47. Dan. 5. Hab. 2, Zach. 8, 9. Ier. 51, 61 — 64. But vvil it therefore follovv, that the Baptisme had in the church of Rome is no ordinance of God, no signe, seale, or sacrament of the Lords, but a vaine idoll and nothing; and to be renounced, as an impure idoll in their abuse; yea to be a lying signe, a de∣testable, and cursed sacrament, as they often speak of it? Or, that all vvho are there baptized, and retayn the baptisme had in that church, as the Lords sacrament, signe, and seale unto them of the forgiuenes of sinnes, shalbe damned? Doe the Scriptures here alledged, proue these things? If not, hovv greatly doe they abuse the Scriptures, and their Readers? as the pa∣pists also doe continually. Yet notvvithstanding we may not because of their abuse, account the Scriptures to be an idoll, or a lye in their right hand, or nothing in the world, &c. but vve must still esteem them to be the holy word of God, the light of our feet and joy of our hearts, the true and sure testi∣monies
of the Lord: how ever they be perverted and abused by them. And hitherto of their abuse of the Scriptures in this place. VAINE DISTINCTIONS, AND Anabaptisticall assertions. Vain distin∣ctions and Anabapti∣sticall asser∣tions.Fiftly, for vaine distinctions, and Anabaptisticall assertions: obserue these: 1. That he maketh tvvo sorts of Idols, and sayth both the kinds are in po∣pish baptisme: and yet neyther of them is to the point in hand: as may be seen by the particulars aforesaid. Besides that in right proprietie of speach, this rather sheweth tvvo sorts of Idolaters, then of Idols: the bra∣sen serpent being not in deed an idoll, but onely idolatrously abused by them2 King. 18, 4. that burnt incense unto it. Neyther doeth the Scripture (that I can find) call it an Idoll: or any where take Idols to be types and sacramentall signes unto us of redemption by Christ, asNum. 21 8, 9. with Joh. 3, 14.15. the brazen serpent was to Israel in the wilder∣nes: as here by themselues is observed. Thus also (as they doe) not two onely, but many sorts of Idols may be made in other respects: As besides those that are here named by themselues; and such also, as are onely ficti∣ons and imaginations of the mynd; some to be of such things as being giuen by the Lord, for the common use and service of the world, yet are made Idols by men unto themselues,Lev. 19, 4. Deu. 4, 15, 16 — 19. Ier. 10, 2, 3. Hos. 13, 2, Act. 27, 42, 43. Phil. 3, 19. Col. 3, 5. 1 Joh. 5, 21 as the Sunne, Moone, Starres, &c. some parts of the body, and other creatures giuen to man also for his use, as the belly, money, and the like, are by many made their God: Also kings and Princes in kingdomes; Husbands, vviues, and children in families; Mini∣sters and people in churches; yea the church, and Christ himself, are often made Idols, by the vayne opinions, sinnes, and abuse of men: and many other the like things, which were long to declare & insist upon in parti∣cular. But shal vve therefore say, that these indeed are Idols, and so many several sorts of Idols also? And that they are not the true Sunne, Moone, Starres, &c. Or should we not rather acknowledge, that these are the Lords good ordinances, benefits, & mercies unto us: vvhich many abuse idolatrously, to their ovvne hurt, & to the dishonour of God; but not to the annihilating of the Lords institutions themselues? And novv by this occasion, let me wish these men to consider well with themselues, whe∣ther their ovvne errors (about this and other matters) be not in deed idols before the Lord:Exod. 20, 4.5.6. Ezec. 14, 7. Hos. 13, 2. 1 Joh 5, 1. such as be all erroneous opinions and courses in reli∣gion, vvhich men frame to themselues according to their ovvne under∣standing; whether concerning Christ himself, or concerning his faith, or∣der, vvorship, or any part of religion; othervvise then the Lord hath him∣self prescribed in his word. By meanes whereof it cometh often to passe, that many vvho think themselues most free from idolatrie, & haue their eyes onely bent upon others in this behalf, are yet notwithstanding them selues deeply plunged therein. 2. It is also a vayn distinction, as touching the question in hand, when to reconcile the Apostles vvords vvho saith, an idoll is nothing in the world, 1 Cor. 8, 4. with the Prophets vvords, vvho saith, their idols are silver & gold, the vvork of mens hands, Psal. 115, 4. they tell us, that an idoll for the matter is
something, but for relation to God or divine grace it is nothing. For what concerneth this the Lords ordinance of baptisme, that is the signe of his covenant, & hath relation thereto, &c? Or what agreement haue idols with the Lords ordinances: that here they giue us idle distinctions concerning Idols? 3. For other odious & Anabaptistical assertions note these novv like∣wise together, which haue here before upon several occasions ben obser∣ved alreadie. 1. That he calleth Christs baptisme (corrupted) Antichrists Christening. 2. That making two sorts of Idols, he sayth there is a mixture in An∣tichrists Christening, of both sorts of abominations. 3. That therefore they haue re∣nounced the Romish baptisme, as an impure idoll in their abuse, &c. 4. That it is a lye in the right hand of all that so receiue it, Esa. 44, 20. 5. And that the say∣ing of the Apostle is verified in it, an idoll is nothing in the world. 1 Cor. 8, 4.6. That the vvater in baptisme there received, is as the gold & silver of the he∣thens Idols, spoken of, Psal. 115, 4. 7. That the outward action and work of the priests hands in baptisme, is as the work of mens hāds that make the Idols aforesaid. 8. That touching the relation (which is the mayn thing in a Sacrament) &c. so it is a vayn Idol and nothing. 9. That it wil not help to say, that baptisme in it self consi∣dered, is Christs ordinance (though corruptly abused and administred among them) because the brasen serpent being in it self Gods ordinance at first, and a sacra∣mental signe of redemption by Christ: yet they that burnt incense unto it, made it an Idol, and therefore as Nehushtan (a peece of brasse) it was destroyed. What strength this giveth (if there vvere trueth and waight in it) & how neare it com∣meth to that other assertion, which some among thē boldly affirme, that the baptisme aforesaid is no more or better to be esteemed, but as the common washing of our hands or faces with water, let such as are vvise consider: As also vvhat great seduction and erroneous grounds leading to Anabaptistrie, are cowched in the assertions aforesaid. And these, so many together in the compasse of one page, besides infinite the like othervvhere. Wherein they should haue had the more care of their own sayings; least while they impute blasphemie to the Papists (as here they doe, & justly) they fal them∣selues also, by their assertions, into the same transgression and impietie. Other things more might be observed and answered about the parti∣culars aforesaid: but these are ynough: & more then here I would haue noted, but that their owne dealing, and the regard of others and of the truth it self, did urge me thereunto. And hitherto of the Shifts, errors, con∣tradictions, abuse of Scriptures, vaine distinctions, and Anabaptisticall assertions, found in these fewe lynes. What abundant store of such stuffe he hath about his and other matters besides, in this treatise of his (vvhich vvere endles o insist upon in particular) may euen by this litle sufficiently appeare to such as are judicious & unpartiall. Now here I wil onely proceed to one or two moe objections that are much urged about the matter in hand. OBJECTION IIII. But Israell in their defection (from whom divers of the former reasons & answers are taken) becomming Apostate,M.A. &c when Ieroboam set up the golden
Calues,Animad v. p. 68, 70. 81, 82, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, &c. and Israel committed Idolatrie with them, were not in their apostaste the people of God, or his church: but were cast off by the Lord, and divorced from him; the covenant was broken not onely on their part, but also on his: so as now he gaue them a bill of divorce, and ceased to be their God, and they to be his people. And (as touching circumcision or any such ordi∣nances reteyned among them)Animad. pag. 70. seeing they then were fallen2 Chr. 15 3. frō God, and from his church, and so wereIer. 3, 8. divorced from the Lord, and wereHos. 2, 2. not his wife, butHos. 13, 1 dead in their sinnes: the ordinances of God which they in shew re∣teyned, could not be unto them the signes and seales of forgiuenes of sinnes, & of life eternall, and therefore were in their use of them, false and deceitfull; as were also the ordinances of God reteyned in other nations, asNumb. 23.1. Pom∣pon. Laetus de sacerdo. &c. Altars Sa∣crifices, Priests, tithes, first fruits, incense, meat offrings, drink offrings, feasts, baptismes or washings, anoyntings, excōmunications, prayers, vowes, & many the like, wherof al histories do beare record, that the Gentiles did reteyn thē. ANSWER. Very erroneous and ungodly assertions are here againe: & such as are directly contrary to the Scriptures, in the true meaning & intendement thereof. For the Lord was yet stil their God, & they his people & church, both in the account of the Lord himself and of his holy Prophets: asAdvert. p. 59 — 63. in another treatise I haue shewed heretofore. Which being still so errone∣ously denyed, and colourably oppugned by them, I will therefore novv againe insist hereupon. And that also the more largely, considering the waight of the matter, and their abuse of the Scriptures about it. Yet will I but treat of some speciall particulars, of the exceeding many testimo∣nies of Scripture, and reasons that might from thence be deduced about this matter. 1. The Prophet that annoynted Iehu King over Israell, spake thus un∣to him, in the Name of the Lord,2 Kin. 9, 6. &c. Thus saith the Lord God of Israell, I haue annoynted thee King over the people of the Lord, euen over Israell, &c. 2 King. 9, 6. Where first obserue, that there vvas almost an hundred yeeres, & in that timeIerobo∣am, Nadab Baasha, E∣lah, Zimri, Tibn, Om∣ri, Ahab, Abaziah, Iehoram, Iehu. tenne kings, from the defection of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat (who set up the calues) unto Iehu now anointed to reigne over Israel. Al which time, the Lord was yet still their God, and they his people, as the Prophet here affirmeth in the Name of the Lord. Which that it may the better appeare, I vvould aske of these Opposites, first, whether this Pro∣phet spake trueth or falsehood, vvhen now he said, Thus saith the Lord God of Israell? Secondly, whether the Lord himself spake trueth or falsehood, when he said to Iehu by the Prophet, I haue anoynted thee King over the people of the Lord, over Israell? And thirdly, vvhether Iehu was anoynted a true King in deed (and not supposedly onely) over Israel the people of the Lord? Fourthly, let us cōpare herewith the like speach of the Lords concerning David, vvhen he saidChro. 6, 5 6. with 2 Sam. 5, 2. & 2 Kin. 20, 5. I haue chosen David to be a ruler over my people Israell 2 Chron. 6, 5, 6. And vvas not this so in trueth and in deed? Finally, marke
that in this speach,Gen. 17, 7 Esa. 63, 19 the vvords of the covenant are still reteyned and ex∣pressely used, vvhen the Prophet saith not onely, The Lord, but The Lord God of Israell, and againe, the people of the Lord, euen Israell. Now if the Lord and his Prophet spake the trueth as the thing was in deed, then these Oppo∣sites teach falsehood: and so if the Scripture be true, their vvritings and assertions are false. Yea they deale farre worse then the Captaynes that vvere then vvith Iehu, who (how ever in a svvaggering veyne they called the Prophet2 King. 9, 11. a mad fellowe, afore they knevv vvhy he came to Iehu, yet) vvhen they knevv the man & the matter, they presently shevved by their deeds and words, that they esteemed his message, as the vvord and work of the Lord; and himself, as the Lords Prophet, and not as a mad fellow: much lesse as a false fellow, that spake leasing of the Lord and of Israell, or any othervvise then as the case then stood in deede and in truth. 2 Kin. 9, 1 — 13. with 1 King. 19, 15, 16. This dealing of those Captaines, vvill rise up in judgment against these men: if still they goe on in despising the word of God, and reviling his servants, & will not upon knowledge of the will of God shewed unto them, yeild thereunto: as these Israelites (now in apostasie) did in the matter aforesaid. Which I note the rather, because2 Kin. 9, 6. this Scripture (with some other) hath benAdver. pag. 59. shewed them heretofore: and yet they cease not, but set thēselues purposely to oppugne us herein. Now to proceed, after Iehues time also, the Scripture sheweth, that when Hazael king of Syria had oppressed Israel al the daies of Jehoahaz (the sonne of Iehu)2 Kin. 13 22, 23. the Lord was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had re∣spect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neyther cast he thē frō his presence as yet. where marke these things, first how the Lord of his free grace holp and preserved Israel in their mi∣sery, because of his covenant with Abraham and the Fathers, vvherein he had promised to be not onely their God, but the God also of their seed after thē. Gen. 17, 7. Secondly, that God had not cast them from his presence as yet. And this was aboue an hundred yeres after the time of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, as the historie sheweth. So as this Scripture alone sufficiently declareth, that Is∣raell vvas yet still under the covenant of the Lord: and that both in the Lords own account, and in the estimation of the Prophets that recorded these things. Moreover, the Scripture recordeth, that2 King. 14, 23, 25. Jeroboam the sonne of Ioash (the thirteenth king from Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat that made the calues) restored the coast of Israell from the entring in of Hamath, unto the sea of the plaine, ac∣cording to the word of the Lord God of Israells which he spake by the hand of his ser∣vant Ionah, the sonne of Amittai the Prophet. Where againe obserue those termes, the word of the Lord God of Israell, vvhich he spake by his servant Ionah the Prophet. Was this then the vvord of a supposed Lord God of Israel, or of him that vvas in deed and in trueth the Lord God of Israel? Was Ionah the servant and Prophet of an imaginarie God, or of him that was indeed (both in the Lords account, and in his owne persvvasion) the Lord God of Israell? Or was it any other God then this, to whom Ionah prayed in his
distres when he saith he prayed to the Lord his God &c.Jon. 2, 1 — 9 Or did he pray to any other God, then the onely true God, that was the God of Israel, by his covenant of grace made vvith the Fathers? 2 Kin. 13, 23. Many the like sayings might be produced out of the historie of Israell, and books of the Prophets: which were long to note and urge in parti∣cular: & there vvill be occasion to speak more hereafter about this mat∣ter. Here therefore I vvill but cite some places, vvhich the Reader may turne unto, and obserue, about the point in hand, 1 King. 14, 7, 13. & 16, 33. and 17, 1, 12, 14, 18, 20. 2 King. 5, 15, 17. 2 Chron. 30, 6 — 9.

Where the Prophets expressely call and with a joint consent account Israell in their defection (as they did Iudah also in their apostasie) to be the people of the Lord, and the Lord to be their God: and this also in deed and in trueth, as the places themselues and the matters spoken off, with the circumstances thereabout, doe plainely ma∣nifest. And that these termes (Thy God, and my People, and the like) so often used, both touching Israell and Iudah, are termes and notes of the cove∣nant, is so evident throughout the Scriptures, as it is straunge that any should offer to denye it. For vvhich see, Gen. 17, 7. Exo. 3, 15, 16, 18. and 6, 7. Lev. 2, 13. Num. 10, 9, 10.

Otherwise the tribe of Iudah (vvhich is also called the people of the Lord, and God said to be their God) vvhen they2 Kin. 21 22. & 22. 17. 2 Chr. 12, 1, 5. & 21, 10, 11. & 24, 20.24. Esa. 1, 4, 21. Ier. 1 16. & 2, 13. &c. forsook the Lord, and be∣came Apostates and Idolaters, & committed other notorious sinnes be∣sides, and that in such sort,Ezec. 16.2.51. & 23, 2 — 11. &c. as they justified Israel and became more corrupt then shee (for which the Lord punished them seveerely, & cast them out of his land into captivitie in Babylon) should not indeed and in trueth be ac∣counted the people & church of God. Neither should those termes, (My people, Thy God, and the like, spoken concerning them by the Prophets, in such estate) imply and teach us, that yet notwithstanding they were then still under the covenant of God, and so both by the Lord himself and by his Prophets esteemed to be his church and people. Jer. 2, 11, 13, 17, 31, 32. and 3, 20, 21. and 4, 11, 22. and 5, 31. and 6, 14, 27. and 7, 2.— 12 — 28. and 8, 7, 19, 21, 22. & 15, 6, 7. & 18, 15. and 23, 2, 13, 22, 27, 32. and 28, 14. and 29, 4, 8. &c.

And if we look to former times, the children of Israel (all the tribes of old, both Iudah and Israel together) in the times of the Iudges, &c. should not be the people and church of God: if the exceptions aforesaid
were of vvaight. For they also then forsook the Lord, and fell into defe∣ction, and became great idolaters: & vvere for that & other their sinnes often and sore punished of the Lord. As in the book of Iudges may be seen. Iudg. 2, 11, 12, 13, 19. and 3, 5, 6, 7. and 6, 1, 10, 25 — 30. and 8, 27. & 10, 6. & 17 chap. & 18, 30, 31. with 1 Sam. 7, 3, 4. & 12, 9, 10. & Psa. 78, 56, 57, 58, 59. &c. and 106, 34 — 39, &c. 1 Kin. 11, 33. Besides that Ezekiel and others note the like also concerning them, when they were in Egypt; in the wildernes; and in the land of Canaan. Ezec. 20, 7, 8, 9, 10— 27. &c. & 23, 2, 3, &c. Amos 5, 2, 26, 27. with Act. 7, 38 — 43. 4. But to insist on the tenne tribes more particularly, & yet further to obserue some moe things out of the Prophets and other Scriptures con∣cerning them: let us first of al remember, that the Lord vvhen he brought Israell out of Egypt, and gaue them his Lavv, spake these vvords & said, I am the Lord thy God, vvhich haue brought thee out of the land of Egypt,Exo. 20, 1, 2, 3, &c. out of the house of bondage: Thou shalt haue no other Gods before me, &c. This I suppose they will not deny to be spoken by the Lord to his church and people in¦deed and in truth. Now Hoseah the Prophet in his time (about two hun∣dred yeares after Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat had set up the calues at Dan & Be∣thell, and caused Israel to sinne) speaking unto Ephraim, who had novv ben so long in defection, saith unto them in the Name of the Lord,Hos. 13, 4. Yet am I the Lord thy God from the Land of Egypt, and thou shalt knovv no God but me. &c. Hos. 13, 4. vvith v. 1, 2, 3. Where obserue, that inExo. 20, 2 Hos. 13, 4. in both places, the words of the covenant are used, and in the same termes, I am the Lord thy God, &c. Which shevveth plainely, that they vvere now still the Lords people, un∣der his covenant, and were so esteemed by the Lord himself and by his Prophets in deed and in truth. 5. By theHos. 13, 4 same Scripture appeareth also, that they were accounted now still not onely the Lords people, but euen as the same people of Is∣raell, whom the Lord brought out of Egypt: notwithstanding that they lived now so many generations after, and had gone through so many chaunges of their estate, and were also fallen into great defection, & had so long continued in that apostasie: & vvere not yet cast out of the land of Canaan, &c. Which appeareth yet further, by the next vvords in the same place, where the Lord also sayth,Hos. 13, 5 6. I did knovv thee in the vvildernes. &c. And, According to their pasture (speaking of the land of Canaan) so vvere they filled. Hos. 13, 6. and by divers other like speaches of the Prophets: which vvere long to insist upon in particular: as namely, when the Prophets say,Hos. 10, 9. and 9, 9. they had sinned from the dayes of Gibeah (which vvasIud. 19. &c. in the time of the Iudges) andHos. 13, 10, 11, 12. with 1 Sā 8. &c. from the dayes of King Saul: and had yet still ben partakers of Gods mercies:Hos. 11, 1 — 4. with 13, 4, 5. from the comming out of Egypt, vvhence he brought them and guy∣ded and fed them in the vvildernes: yea, euenHos. 11, 1 — 4. with 13, 4, 5. from the birth of Iacob,Hos. 12, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10 11, 12. &c & the Lords speaking vvith him atGen. 3 6-11. &c. Bethell: Whereabout those words of the Prophet are remarkable, The Lord found Jacob in Bethell, and there he spake vvith us. With us, saith the Prophet Hosea, speaking of Israell and himself together, now at that time. Hos. 12, 4. The like testimonies may be observed also in other of
the Prophets: as in Amos 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, &c. and 3, 1, 2. and 9, 7. with 6, 8, and 8, 7. and Mich. 2, 7. and 6, 2 — 5. compared with Ier. 2, 6. &c. By all vvhich appea∣reth how the Prophets esteemed them stil to be the Lords people, whom he brought out of Egypt, and to be under his covenant, &c. 6. Moreover, the land (where Israell novv dwelt in Canaan) wasHos. 9, 3 the Lords land: like as was that of Iudah also, Ioel 1, 6, 7. In respect whereof, the land of other nations, as of Assyria and the like, was a polluted land: whi∣ther to be driuen, and there to dye, was also threatned as a punishment. Amos 7, 17. vvhereas Israell was not yet driuen out of the Lords land (and so had not yet a bill of divorement) when Hoseah and Amos prophecied. Hos. 9, 15. with ver. 3. and Amos 7 and 8 chap. 7. Neither was the Lord yet departed from them, nor they as yet cast of by him. Hos. 9, 12, 17. vvith 2 King. 13, 23. All which shevveth, hovv they were still the Lords people, and under the Lords covenant made with A∣braham, Isaac, and Iacob, as is expressely mentioned, 2 King. 13, 23. & how greatly therefore they erre, vvho doe not (in this behalf) make other or better account of Israell in their defection, then of the heathen nati∣ons, &c. Of which more hereafter. 8. To the same purpose may be noted, how the Lord blameth Israell, for not observingAmos 8, 2 — 5, &c. the New moones and Sabbaths, as they should: Which were ordinances of the church of God: & for vvhich the heathen nations are never blamed. Which also were part of the partition vvall then standing betvveen the Iewes & Gentiles: and plainly sheweth, how the Lord still accounted them for his church and people, although they had now fal∣len into great backsliding from him. 9. The like may be noted, in that the Prophets rebuke Israell, aswell as Iudah, for making covenants with the Assyrians and Egyptians, relying on them, and seeking help at their hands, & not of the Lord, in their distresse. Ezech. 23, 2, 5, 6. with ver. 11.12, 13. Also Hos. 5, 13. and 7, 11. with Esa. 30, 1 — 7. and 31, 1, 8. Ier. 2, 36. &c. and with Deut. 7, 1, 2. &c. 10. Also, in that they reckon it among the sinnes of Israell, thatHos. 5.7. and 7, 8. they begate straunge children, being mixed in mariage with the people of other natiōs. Like as it is reckoned among the sinnes of the Israelites generally, Judg. 3, 5, 6. with Psal. 106, 34, 35. and of Iudah also particularly, and is noted as a breach of the covenant among them, Mal. 2, 11. Ezra. 9 and 10 cha. Neh. 13.1, 2, 3.4, 23, &c. Which could not so haue ben to Israell, as it was to Iudah, had they not ben now still the people of God, and under his covenant, as Iudah vvas: notwithstanding this and their other manifold iniquities, so much and sharpely reproved by the Prophets. Or doth God ever blame the nations, or any persons that were not his people and under his cove∣nant, for mixing themselues in mariages & covenants with other people, for begetting strange children, for seeking help at their hands, &c. So as these things also shevv Israell still to be the people and church of God, to whom these lawes vvere giuen, and of vvhom was required obedience thereunto (for not marying and covenanting in such sort with the hea∣then
of other nations) together with the rest of the lawes of God. Exod. 34, 15, 16. Deut. 7, 1 — 6, &c. with 1 King. 11, 1, 2. and Hos. 5, 7. and 7, 8.. 11. And generally, thatHos. 8.12. the Lord wrote unto them the great things of his law. Which he shewed not to other nations, as he did to Israell, to whom he gaue his statutes and judgments. Psal. 103, 7. and 147, 19, 20. with Deu. 4, 5 — 8. 12. Also, thatAmo. 2, 6, 7. the Name of God is said to be profaned by Israel, aswel as by Iudah: whō these men themselues (I think) wil not deny to be the church and people of God, remayning then still under his covenant, &c. Amos 2 6, 7. compared with Esa. 52, 5. and 63, 19. Ezech. 36, 20, 23. 13.Hos. 13, 12, 13. Yea Ephraim is acknowledged for “ a sonne (though an unwise sonne) being novv in defection: And Israell isHos. 8, 1, 2. Amo. 3 1. the house and familie of the Lord: & together with Iudah is so called. Amos 3, 1, 2. with 2, 4, 6. Hos. 8, 1. and 9, 15. Which terme also is attributed to the churches of the Christians, the churches of God novv in the time of the Gospell. 1 Tim. 3, 15. 2 Tim. 2, 20. Luk. 12, 42. 14. And when a vision of judgmentAmo. T 1 — 5. upon Israel was shevved to Amos the Prophet, he prayeth for them, as being now stilSo Da∣naeus, Cal∣vine and others ex∣pound and understand it. the people & church of God, and under the covenant of the Lord, vvhen he saith, O Lord God forgiue, I beseech thee, by whom shall Iacob arise? for he is small. Amos 7, 2. And a∣gaine, vvhen another like vision was shewed him, O Lord God cease, I beseech thee, by whom shall Iacob arise? for he is small. ver. 5. Where the Prophet, in his prayer to God for Israel, useth tvvo reasons of waight, implying so much. First, when he calleth this people Iacob; not Edom, Moab, Ammon, Ashur, Cush or the like, that were straungers from the promise & covenant of God: but purposely termeth them Iacob, as being the children of Iacob, of his seed and familie, and therefore the chosen and adopted people of God, vvhom he loved and took into covenant, and to vvhom he promised and shewed mercy, &c. 2 King. 13, 23. vvith Mal. 1, 2. Amos 8, 7. vvith Psal. 47, 4, 9. and 14.7. and 83, 3 — 8. Ier. 2, 4. Hos. 12, 2 — 12. &c. Secondly, vvhen he alled∣geth that Jacob (this people) vvas small, having ben sore afflicted, & almost vvorne out by enemies and other calamities: as appeareth in the books of the Kings. 1 King. 16, and 2 King. 8, 12. and 13, 22. and 14, 26. and othervvhere in the historie: so that (although their sinnes deserved Gods chastisement, in respect of themselues, yet) novv the Prophet vvas earnest vvith the Lord, that he vvould remember Iacob (this people of his) in mercie, and not ut∣terly consume them: but novv the more to pitty them and shevv them mercy, vvhen they vvere become small, & brought so low. And thus much is acknovvledged by these men themselues othervvhere: Annot. o Psal. 14, 7. where David saying, When the Lord returneth the captivitie of his people aacob shalbe glad, Israel shal rejoice: the note is thus vvord for vvord: Iaacob, Israel] that is, Gods people, the posteritie of Jaacob, vvho also vvas called Israell: (So Aaron is put for his posteritie, the Aaronites, 1 Chron. 12, 27. and 27, 12. and David for his children, 1 Chron. 14, 31.) Jaacob is a name that noteth infirmitie, &c. But to returne to the prayer of Amos the Prophet, the very same reasons that e useth here touching Israel, are also used in prayer unto God, concerning
Iudah, Psal. 79, 6, 7, 8. &c. and in more generall termes, touching all Israell joyntly, long before, in Moses time, Psal. 90, 13. So as these prayers of A∣mos for Israell in defection, are the more to be noted, both for that they agree vvith the like prayers made othervvhere for Iudah (vvhom these men themselues vvil acknovvledge to be the people and church of God, notvvithstanding they also forsook the Lord, and fell often into idolatrie, and other great iniquities:) and because the Prophet thus prayeth for Is∣rael againe and againe, tvvise using and as it vvere urging these reasons to the Lord; vvho both the times heard, & yeelded to these his requests, concerning them. Amos 7, 2 — 6. vvith 1, 1. and 2 King. 14, 26, 27. 15. Yea vvhen aftervvard the Lord gaue Israell into the hands of the Assyrians for their sinnes, yet he so regarded them, asIer. 50.17.18. he punished the King of Assyria that devoured Israell: like as he punished the king of Babylon, that brake the bones of Judah, vvhom likevvise for their sinnes the Lord gaue into the hands of the Babylonians. And both to Israel & Iudah, he promised mercy & forgiuenes of sinne, to the remnant of both of them (not of Iudah one∣ly, but of Israell also) whom he vvould reserue. Ier. 50, 17 — 20. Eyther there∣fore let them deny Iudah then to haue ben the church & people of God, or let them also yeild it unto Israell: seeing both fell into defection from the Lord, and both vvere chastised by him, and both their enemies puni∣shed, and mercy promised to the reserved remnant of them both: As the Prophets many times teach. For vvhich, together vvith the Scripture a∣foresaid, see also 1 Chron. 9, 1, 2, 3. Esa. 17, 3 — 6. Ier. 50, 1 — 4. Hos. 1, and 2, and 3 ch. &c. Micah 1, 1. and 2, 12. and 4, 10. and 5, 6, 7, 8. and 7, 18, 19, 20. Nahum 1, 1, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15. and 2, 1, 2, 3. and 3, 18, 19. Zach. 1, 18, 19. vvith 8, 13. 16. Finally, so long as Israell dvvelt in the land of Canaan (vvhich vvas the Land of Promise) and there enjoyed their ovvne policie (civill & ec∣clesiasticall) among themselues, though extreemely corrupted and adul∣terate: so long also as the Lord was pleading with them by his Prophets, calling them to repentance, denouncing against them his judgments for their sinnes, &c. so long Ephraim (the tenne tribes figuratiuely so called) ceased not to be a people;Esa. 7, 8. vvith Deu. 32, 21.21. Rom. 20.19. and the children of Israell vvere novv beloved of the Lord, though as touching themselues they were in apostasie and idolatrie: Euen like as a womā vvho is beloved of her friend or husband, though shee her self be an adulteresse: As the Scripture plainely teacheth. Esa. 7.8. and Hos. 3, 1 — 4. with 1, 2 — 9. and 2, 1, 2. &c. and 9, 3.12.15.17. Amos 3.1.2. with 1.1. & 2.4.6 — 11. and 7.2.5.15.17. and 8.1 — 5. Mic. 6.1.2. &c. vvith 2 Kin. 9.6. and 13, 23. and the other Scriptures here before alledged concerning their estate. Many other testimonies and arguments might be alledged to this pur∣pose, out of the Prophets and historie of the Scriptures, to shevv the er∣rour and falsehood of the aforesaid assertions, touching Israell, &c. But these for the present may suffice. Novv to come to the Scriptures vvhich are here alledged by themselues) more particularly: although their ab∣use thereof may sufficiently appeare by that vvhich hath ben said, yet for more clearing of the matter, let us novv also insist upon those places,
vvhich (to beare out the former assertions) they haue here thus purpose∣y and particularly joyned together themselues. Touching 2 Chron. 15, 3. The first place is 2 Chron. 15, 3. vvhere2 Chron. 15, 1.2. Azariah the Prophet meeting Asa King of Iudah, and all Iudah and Benjamin with him (as2 Chr. 14 15. and 15.2. they retur∣ned to Ierusalem from the vvarre had vvith the Ethiopians) said unto thē2 Chro. 15, 2 — 7. The Lord is vvith you, vvhile ye be vvith him, and if ye seek him he wil be found of you: but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you: Novv for a long season Israell hath ben vvithout the true God, and vvithout a teach∣ing Priest, and without Lavv: But vvhen they in their trouble did turne unto the Lord God of Israel, and sought him, he vvas found of them: And in those dayes there vvas no peace to him that vvent out, and to him that came in, but great vexations vvere upon all the inhabitants of the coun∣treyes: And nation vvas destroyed of nation, & city of city: for God did vex them vvith all adversitie: Be strong therefore, & let not your hands be vveak: for your vvork shalbe revvarded. 2 Chro. 15, 2 — 7. Here the Pro∣phet incourageth them in the work & service of the Lord, and exhorteth them to continue and goe forvvard vvith the reformation of Religion, vvhich vvas already begunne; whereof there is speach in the chapter go∣ing before, vvhere it is said, that2 Chron. 14, 2 — 5. Asa did that vvhich vvas good and right in the eyes of the Lord his God. For he took away the altars of the strange Gods, and the high places, and brake downe the images, and cut down the groues: and commanded Ju∣dah to seek the Lord God of their Fathers, and to doe the Law and the commandement. Also he took away out of al the cities of Iudah, the bye places and the images: and the kingdome was quiet before him. Novv to incourage them to continevv this reformation so wel begun, the Prophet useth divers reasons, both in respect of things present, and things to come, and things already past: and all of them in regard of the Lord himself, & his dealing vvith them, according as they did or should walk vvith him: Touching things present, because the Lord had now hevved himself to be vvith them, in giving thē deliverance from the Ethio∣pians, and victorie over them, vvhiles they vvere careful of reforming his vvorship: For the time to come, that if they sought the Lord, putting trust in im, and being carefull to vvorship him according to his vvord, the Lord ould be found of them: but if they should forsake him, declining to false vvor∣hip, leaving of the reformation begun, then he would forsake them, & leaue em in their daungers and miserie. For the time past, that Israel had ben a ng season without the true God, and vvithout a teaching priest, and vvithout law: &c.  vvhich time no peace but much anguish and trouble had ben unto them. Which hether it be understood of the tenne tribes of Israell, or of Iudah, or of  Israel together (as it is byLavate, Strigelius, Piscator, &c. in 2 Chro. 15. divers diversly applyed) yet it commeth to ke purpose for the point in hand; shewing how they neglected and left f the true vvorship of God, and were then by the Lord punished divers aies.
If it be understood of the tenne tribes (as vvell it may be) then we may apply it to Ieroboams defection, and the estate of things among them from that time, to the daies of Asa here spoken off. For novv they had left the Temple and true vvorship of God, and follovved Ieroboams calues, and so are said to beSee also more here∣after, about the phrase of forsake∣ing the Lord, &c. p. 67, &c. vvithout the true God. Now likevvise they had left the Lords Priests, that were of Aarons line, & set them up Priests of the low∣est of the people: and vvere vvithout a teaching priest, not having true do∣ctrine soundly taught, nor yet regarding it, and being vvithout the sacri∣ficers of the Lord. Novv also they had left the Law of the Lord, and follovved the commandement of the King, and their owne inventions, Hos. 5.11. and 13.2. and so are said to be vvithout Lavv. And thus applying it to the ten tribes of Israel, vve may well understand it of the defection of those times, vvhen they left the true worship of God, and follovved the calues at Dan and Bethel, &c. If it be understood of Judah, (as some apply it, and the termeBy a Sy∣needoche. Israell is sometimes put for Judah, 2 Chron. 12.1.4.5.6. and 21.2. &c.) then it may be referred to the apostasie and false vvorship that had prevailed in Iudah, since Rehoboams time, in vvhose dayes Iudah is said to haue forsaken the Lord and his lavv, and to haue built by places, and images, and groues, &c. 2 Chro. 12.1, 2, 5. vvith 1 King. 14, 21 — 24. The reformation vvhereof Asa had novv be∣gun to make. As at other times also after this, the Lord complaineth of Iudah by the Prophet, saying, Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her at∣tire? yet my people haue forgotten me dayes vvithout number. Ier. 2, 32. If it be understood of all the tribes of Israell together (as some also apply it, and so the vvord Israell is often used) then it may be referred to the defe∣ction, and leaving of the true worship of God, so often mentioned in the book of Iudges as where it is said, that the childrē of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forsook him, & served Baal and Ashtaroth, &c. Iud. 2, 11, 12, 13, &c. And here (for the point in hand) note, that in the Scripture, by forsaking the Lord, is often meant the leaving of his true worship and service, & the follovving of idols and idolatrie, &c. As vvhen it is said, that the children of Israell did evill in the sight of the Lord, and forsook the Lord God of their Fathers, there is further added this explication, that they served Baalim, and follovved other Gods, of the Gods of the people that vvere round about them, &c. Iud. 2, 11, 12.13.19.20. So also Rehoboam king of Iudah, and all Israell, are said to forsake the Lord, 2 Chr. 12, 5. that is, to forsake the lavv of the Lord, 2 Chr. 12, 1. and to transgresse against the Lord, ver. 2. provoking him to jelousy vvith their sinnes, and building thē high places, & images, & groues, &c. 1 King. 14, 21 — 24. And thus the Lord long after again complaineth of Iu∣dah by Ieremie, saying: My people haue committed tvvo evils: they haue forsa∣ken me, the fountaine of living vvaters, and hevved them out cisternes, broken cisternes that can hold no vvater. Ier. 2, 13. going after Baalim, ver. 23, &c. making cakes to the Queen of of Heauen, & powring out drink offrings to other Gods, to provoke me to anger. Ier. 7, 18. and 44, 16, 19. And, I vvill sette my judgments against them touching all their vvickednes, vvho haue forsaken me,
and haue burnt incense unto other Gods, and vvorshiped the vvork of their owne hands. Jer. 1, 16. And many the like throughout the Scriptures, good to be obser∣ved thereabout. As, Iudg. 10.6. 1 Sam. 8.8. and 12.10. 1 King. 9.9. and 11.33. and 18.18. 2 King. 21.21.22. and 22.17. 2 Chro. 7.22. and 21.10.11. and 24.18.20.24. and 29.6. and 34.25. Esa. 65.2 — 11. Jer. 5.7.19. and 9.13.14. and 16.11, &c. Which maner of speach with other the like in the Scripture is to be ob∣served, that vve may aright understand these phrases, of forsaking the Lord, falling and departing from the Lord, going a whoring from under the Lord, despising, polluting, and forgetting the Lord, & other the like speaches, often spoken tou∣ching the forsaking, despising, polluting, forgetting of the Law, comman∣dements, Temple, vvorship, & service of the Lord, &c. (as by theIudg 2, 12, 13. & 3, 7. 1 Sam. 15, 11. 1 King. 18, 18. 2 Chr. 12, 1, 5. & 24, 18, 20, 24. and 25, 27. and 29 6. Psal. 106 20, 21, 39. Ezec. 23, 5. Ier. 2, 13. and 3, 20, 21. and 22 9. Ezec. 22 8. Mal. 1. 6, 7, 8. &c. Scri∣pture it self, and Chaldee Paraphrase, they are expounded usually:) and not simply of so dealing vvith the Lord himself; as the bare vvords and letter it self might seem to imply. For euen in the defection of Israell, vvhen Ieroboam set up the calues, yet still they intended to worship the Lord that brought them out of the Land of Egypt, as their Fathers had done of old in the vvildernes. 1 King. 12, 28. with Exo. 32, 4, 5, 8. And Naaman being healed by Elisha (a2 King. 5, 8. Prophet in Israell) acknowledged the Lord God of Israell to be the onely true God. 2 Kin. 5, 15, &c. Iehu is anoynted king over Israell, the people of the Lord, 2 Kin. 9, 6. And hath zeale for the Lord against Baal, 2 King. 10, 16. and provideth for the servants of the Lord, vvhen he slayeth the vvorshippers of Baal, and destroyeth Baal out of Israell, 2 King. 10, 23 — 28. Yet he departed not from the sinnes of Jeroboam the sonne of Nebat, and took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of Israell with all his heart. 2 King. 10, 29 — 31. Likewise of Iehoahaz after him (when Israel was oppressed by the Syrians) it is said that he besought the Lord, and the Lord hear∣kened unto him. 2 King. 13, 2, 3. And many the like may be observed about the ten tribes. And much more concerning Judah, and all Israell together, in their corruptest times: if it were needfull to insist thereupon. By this then may appeare, that of whomsoever the Scripture aforesaid be understood, yet it will not proue, that circumcision or the other ordi∣nances of God, had among the Ievves (vvhether in Israell, or in Iudah) vvere false and deceitfull signes, & no better then the abominations of the heathen, here called by them, the ordinances of God reteyned in other nations. And if it vvould, then it might be urged against Iudah also, and not against Israell onely: as hath ben declared. And vvhere then was circumcision, or the church of God, if now they vvere not in Iudah and Israell, nor among the Ievves any more then among the Gentiles? But of this Scripture vvith other the like, and of the estate of Israell di∣versly considered (sometimes in respect of themselues & their idolatrie, breaking the covenant on their part, and provooking the Lord unto wrath: sometimes in respect of the Lord and his grace, not breaking the covenant on his part, but calling them to repentance, &c.) I haue spokenAdver. p. 60, 61. &c. othervvhere: which vvhiles they would oppugne, what other thing doe they but publish their owne errors, contradictions, and abuse of
Scriptures: as in some particulars (about the former Objection) hath ben shevved before, and will further appeare by that vvhich followeth here∣after. But now by this occasion, let me aske this touching themselues: If they vvould that men should thus esteem of Israels sinful departing from Iudah, as here they vvrite: how then would they haue others to esteem, yea vvhat doe they think themselues, of their owne estate, in regard of their sinfull division made from the church whereof they were? Do they think that they also are fallen from the Lord and from his church, &c. & that therefore the baptisme & other ordinances of God reteined among them, are false and deceitfull, and no better then the observances of the heathen, &c. And vvhereasArrow against I∣dol. p. 71. &c. they know that such haue stil some preten∣ces, which they are woont to alledge for the more colouring of their sin∣full iniquitie: let them but see and consider the things which themselues haue observed heretofore, touchingArrow against I∣dol. p. 71. &c. Ieroboam, what he could pretend for himself and the cause of Israell aforesaid: And let them make good use of it novv for themselues. Touching Ier. 3.8. The next Scripture here cited by them, is Ier. 3.8. where Ieremie the Prophet writeth thus,Ier. 3, 6, 7, 8. The Lord said also unto me in the dayes of Iosiah the King, Hast thou seen that vvhich backsliding Israell hath done? She is gone up upon everie high mountaine, and under every green tree, and there hath played the Harlot. And I said after shee had done all these things: Turne thou unto me: but she turned not, and her trecherous sister Iudah saw it. And I saw, when for all the causes vvhereby backsli∣ding Israell committed adulterie, I had put her avvay, and giuen her a bill of divorce: yet her tretcherous sister Iudah feared not, but went and played the harlot also. Jer. 3, 6, 7, 8. Where note these things: 1. That the Prophet spake this in the dayes of Josiah, (as is said expressely, ver. 6.) at which time Israel vvas now caried avvay captiue out of their owne land into Assyria, some while be∣fore Iosiahs dayes, viz. in the sixt yeere of Hezekiah, &c. 2 King. 18.9 — 12. with 17 chap. So as this place is not to the point of the question in hand: which is concerning the estate of Israell, from Ieroboams time, all the while they abode in the land. 2. And what consequence is there in this, to say, Israel was put away, & had a bill of divorce, in Iosiahs time, therefore it was so dealt vvith, in Jerobo∣ams time; when as Iosiah was about tvvo hundred yeeres after Ieroboam? As if one should say,2 King. 24, 20, and 25, chap. Iudah vvas caryed captiue unto Babylon out of the Lords land and presence, in Zedekiahs time, therefore they were so dealt with in Rehoboams time, whereas Zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah vvas aboue two hundred yeeres after Rehoboam. 3. Nay this is directly against themselues. For seeing they were not put away, nor had a byll of divorce, so long as they dwelt in the Lords land of Canaan; therefore their case vvas, and is otherwise to be esteemed, all that time, then as these men in their prejudicate conceit, for more colour
f their errors, vvould beare us in hand. 4. By this place also compared vvithHos. 9, 3.15, 17. 2 Kin. 13, 23. other places of the Prophets) ay appeare that by the byll of divorce, giuen unto them, is meant, the put∣ng of them out of the land of Canaan; (as out of the Lords house and presence) and delivering them unto the Kings of Assyria to be caryed thither. To which purpose may be observed, how a woman divorced or put avvay, is termed; one that is cast out, or thrust forth, to wit, out of her husbands house. Ezec. 44, 22. ThusBasting. Cōment. in Catechis. quest. 85. at the ende thereof. some also think that excommunicates who are cast out of the church, and so out of the house of God, may after a sort be said (for the time of their so abiding) to haue a bil of divorce. And all knovv, that such are to be accounted members of the church (though in sinne) al the while their cause is a pleading, til they be proceeded with∣all, and cast out of the church: & that then also they are not to be estee∣med, as put out of the covenant of the Lord: but from his house & fami∣lie, till they repent: so as upon repentance they may and ought to be re∣ceived againe into the Lords house, and admitted to the churches com∣munion, as before. And this, without any nevv baptizing of them again: which yet should be, if they had bē put out of the covenant of the Lord. For baptisme is the signe of our entrance thereinto, and the Lords seale of his so receiving & admitting of us: as circumcision vvas to the Iewes of old. Likevvise vvhen Iudah was cast ou- of the land, and caryed away captiue to Babylon (as God said to Ieremie, concerning them,Ier. 15, 1 Cast them out of my sight, and let them goe forth) and then after seuenty yeeres,Ier. 29, 10. Ezr. 1, 1. &c. accor∣ding to Ieremies prophecie also returned again into the land: they were not circumcised anevv: neyther had the Lord put them out of his cove∣nant; though they had broken the Lords covenant themselues, and were therefore thus chastised by him. According as Ieremie in another place faith expressely,Jer. 51, 5. Israel hath not benForsakē as a widovv. forsaken nor Iudah of his God, of the Lord of hostes: though their land was filled with sin against the Holy one of Israell. Ier. 51.5. Which is the more to be observed, considering the time vvhen Ieremie prophesied (here spoken of before) and the sundry things that here hee speaketh, both of Iudah and Israell. Jer. 50, 4, 5, 17, 18, 19, 20, 33, 34. and 51, 5, 19. with 10, 16. and 3, 6 — 25. Which being duly considered, vvill meet with divers erroneous opinions that are conceived hereabout: and vvill shew that the Lord vvas so far himself from breaking his covenant vvith them on his part, as still from time to time he called them to repentance, by his Prophets and by his corrections and chastisements, and euen in this very thing (when at the last he put thē out of his land) avenged the quar∣rell of his covenant upon them: as he had long before threatned by Mo∣ses against them. Lev. 26, 25. 5. Moreover in theIer. 3, 3. same verse (heere cited by themselues, Ieremie heweth, that when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adulterie, the Lord had put her away, and giuen her a bill of divorce: yet her trecherous sister Iu∣dah feared not, but played the harlot also: so speaking of the idolatries of Iudah, ery often and particularly, both in this chapter, and throughout his pro∣phecy:
As vvhen he saith thatJer. 3, 3. she had an vvhores forehead, and refused to be a∣shamed: Yea thatver. 11. the Lord said unto him, concerning her expressely, The back∣sliding Israell hath iustified her self more then tretcherous Iudah. Of vvhom also he testifieth, that they forsook the Lord, and burnt incense to other Gods, & worshipped the works of their owne hands. Jer. 1, 15, 16. and 2, 13, 18. Saying to a stock, Thou art my Father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth. v. 28. And ac∣cording to the number of thy cityes, are thy Gods, O Iudah. ver. 29. Yea in the cityes of Iudah, and in the streets of Ierusalem, the children gather vvood, and the Fathers kindle the fire, & the vvomen knead their dough to make cakes to the Queene of heauen, & to povvre out drink offrings to other Gods, that they may provoke the Lord to anger. Ier. 7, 17, 18. and 44, 15 — 19. They haue forsaken me (saith the Lord) and haue estraunged this place, and haue burnt incense in it unto other Gods, vvhom neyther they nor their fathers haue knowen, nor the Kings of Iudah, and haue fil∣led this place with the blood of innocents: They haue built also the high, places of Baal, to burne their sonnes vvith fire for burnt offrings unto Baal, vvhich I commanded not, nor spake it, neyther came it into my mynd. Jer. 19, 4, 5. A conspiracie is found among the men of Iudah, & a∣mong the inhabitants of Ierusalem: They are turned back to the iniqui∣ties of their forefathers, vvhich refused to heare my vvords: and the went after other Gods to serue them: the house of Israell, and the house of Iudah haue broken my covenant which I made vvith their fathers Jer. 11, 9, 10. Shall vve novv therefore say of Judah, (as these men doe  Israell) that the Lord vvas not their God, nor they his people; that th Lord brake the covenant on his part also vvith them; that circumcisio and the other ordinances of God reteyned in Iudah, vvere not the Lord signes, nor his seales of the forgiuenes of sinne, but that they were in their use o them, false and deceitfull: and no better then the ordinances of vvorship had a¦mong the heathen. Then the ProphetJer. 1, 1, 2, 3, 16. & 2, 2, 28. Ieremie himself, andZeph. 1, , 4. &c. Zephani vvho prophesied at the same time, against their corruptions;Esa. 1, 1, 11, 29 and 2, 6, 8. and 57, 3, 4, 5. Esay all andMic. 1, 1, 5, 9, 13. & 5, 13, 14. and 6, 16. Micah, who prophecied before against their idolatries; and all thEsa. 8, 16, 17, 18. and 66, 5. Jer. 26, 17-20. and 35, 2. and 36, 4, 12, 19. and 40, 5, 6 and 51, 59, 61. godly that vvere with them in those dayes members of that church had not the Lords signe of circumcision, nor his seale of forgiuenes e sinnes, and of life eternall, nor any other ordinances of God, but such a in their use vvere false and deceitfull: and no better then the abomina¦ons of the heathen. Let him that readeth consider, hovv ungodly and er¦roneous these opinions and assertions are. 6. And obserue also, how they shuffle together both Scriptures an matters, that are cleane differing one from another, touching the poi in question. The other Scripture, which here they cited before, our o 2 Chro. 15, 3. vvas spoken2 Chr. 15 1, 2. 1 Chr 3, 10. in Asaes time, who was the2 Chron. 12, 16. and 14, 1. third king frō R¦hoboam (in2 Chon. 10 chap.  1 Kin. 12. vvhose dayes the division was made by Ieroboam) af which time,2 Kin. 17 & 18, 9, 10, 11.12. Israell had no bill of divorce, nor was put avvay, of a lo time, but abode in the land about two hundred yeeres after: as appear¦eth plainly by the historie. But this Scripture vvhich they joyne vvith
ut of Jer. 3.8. was spoken inIer. 3, 6. Josiahs time, the1 Chr. 3, 10, 14. fifteenth King from Re∣oboam aforesaid: who raigned1 Kin. 14.21 — 2 Kin. 22, 1. about three hundred yeere after him. At vvhich time Israell vvas put out of the land of Canaan, and caryed a∣way into Assyria (aAmo. .17. polluted land:) and so had the bill of divorce here poken off. (Which fell out2 Kin. 18 10, 11. in the sixt yere of Hezekiahs raigne, as I no∣ed before:) Which times and cases therefore, how far they differ one frō another (& so from the point in hand) vvho is there that cannot obserue? 7. Finally, here might further be considered, how in this chapter also, the Lord biddeth IeremieIer. 3, 12, 13, 14. goe and proclaime these words toward the North, and ay, Returne thou backsliding Israell, saith the Lord, and I vvill not cause myne anger to fall upon you: for I am mercifull; saith the Lord, & I will not keep anger for ever: Onely acknovvledge thyne iniquitie that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy waies to the straungers under everie green tree, and ye haue not obeyed my voyce, saith the Lord: Turne, O backsliding children, saith the Lord, for I am maried unto you: and I will take you one of a city, & two of a fa∣mily, and I vvill bring you to Zion. Ier. 3, 12, 13, 14. Where divers things about the points in questiō might be observed, if I would stand thereon. As namely: First, that the Lord here biddeth the Prophet Ieremie, Goe and proclaime these words tovvards the North, that is, towards2 King. 17, 6. Assyria & the land of the Medes, vvhither Israell was now caried away out of the Land of Canaan. 2. Secondly, that he should call them to repentance, saying, Return thou back sliding Israell, saith the Lord, &c. and so promise them mercy in the name of the Lord, saying, I vvil not cause myne anger to fall upon you, &c. which sheweth that the Lord had not dealt with them as they deserved, ut could yet make his anger fall more upon them, if he vvere not merci∣ll and one that kept not anger for ever: And that he dealt otherwise herein then a man doth vvith his vvife, vvhom he putteth avvay, and she becomes another mans: as he shewed before inIer. 3, 1. this chapter. Thirdly, that he saith here to Israell, Onely acknowledge thine iniquitie that thou hast transgressed against the Lord y God, &c. as in the other chapter beforeIer. 2, 2, 19. he said to Iudah: Thyne owne wickednesse shall correct thee, and thy back slidings shall reproue thee: know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing & bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God. &c. where those words, the Lord thy God,Gen. 17,  are words of the covenāt. Fourthly and specially, that he saith, Turne O back sliding Israell, saith the ord, for I am maried unto you, &c.Piscator, Calvin. &c Which mariage the best writers upon this ace, expound also of the Lords covenant of grace. 5. And finally, that e Lord vvould take them, one of a city, and two of a familie, and bring them to Zi∣, &c. So teaching (asCalvin in Jer. 3, 14. one vvell noteth upon this place) that in their irning to God, they should not stay one for another; and that though e body of the people should remain obstinate, yet if a few returned to e Lord, he would be readie to receiue them. Which sheweth the stabi∣tie and eternitie of the Lords covenant: as he spake to Abraham, both r him, and his seed, in their generations: Gen. 17, 7. And that the Lord membreth and performeth his covenant, if but a few be made parta∣kers
of that grace: as Paul also shevveth, Rom.  may ∣vvise teach us, in our comming to the Lord, and yeelding obedience to his vvord, not to depend upon the multitude, nor to stand looking and wayting one for another, but readily to follow the Lords calling; as in another case, Christ spake unto Peter. Joh. 21, 20, 21, 22. These and other like things might here be observed. But they are not the things that I purpose to insist upon, because this point cōcerneth the case of Israel, be∣ing now put out of the land of Canaan, and caried away into Assyria: vvhereas our question is of the estate of Israell, in their defection, from the time of Ieroboam that set up the calues, and so forvvard, vvhiles yet they were not put away, but remained in the land of Cannaan. By which all may see, that this Scripture here cited by them, is vainly alledged, be∣ing not to the purpose and question in controversie. Yet notwithstanding having this occasion, I think it not amisse about this matter here to annexe two things further to be considered off: the one concerning Israell, the other concerning Iudah. As touching Israel, that whereas they were now put out of Canaan, & caried avvay into As∣syria, and placed in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, & in the cities of the Medes, as is recorded, 2 King. 17, 6. there is particular and ex∣presse mention (among the places whither they were caried) of the cities of the Medes. Wherevvith if we compare the Acts of the Apostles, we shal find also particular mention, hovv when the holy Ghost came upon the Apostles at the feast of Pentecost, after Christs ascension, and they spake with toungues to the Ievves that were novv at Ierusalem, of all nations under heauen, to every one in their ovvne toungue; that among the rest, there were also Medes, Act. 2, 9. Which is the more to be observed, first be∣cause this is one of the places before mentioned, vvhither Israell was ca∣ried avvay by the king of Assyria, vvhen God put them out of his land. 2 Kin. 17, 6. Secondly, because Peter now speaking unto these with the rest, saith unto them as to the rest, the promise is made unto you, and to your chil∣dren, &c. Act. 2, 9 — 39. like as also upon another occasion, straightway af∣ter speaking to the Iewes in the Temple, he saith unto them, Ye are the chil∣dren of the Prophets, and of the covenant which God made vvith our Fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the kinreds of the earth be blessed. Vnto you first, God having raised up his sonne Jesus, sent him to blesse you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. Act. 3, 25, 26. Thus shevving that God still re∣membred and regarded his covenant tovvard them, and how the grace and benefit thereof vvas extended unto them in Christ. Now whereas it is said, there vvere dvvelling at Ierusalem, Ievves, devout men, out of every nation under heauen: Act. 2.5. least any should understand it onely of such as had their seated abode & dwelling there, as the word othervvhere is used: M. Beza therefore noteth here,z.  Act. 2.. that in this place the dwellers seem generally to be said any strangers that were at this time at Ierusalem: so as it may comprehend, not onely the stran∣gers that had their seated dwelling there, but such also as for studie or learning of religiō sojourned there for a time, and those moreover that out of sundry nations came thither to
e feast. For novv it vvas the feast of Pentecost, Act. 2, 1. To which pur∣ose also may be observed, how the Arabik translation here hath it thus: ow there vvere men abiding in the holy place (that is in Ierusalem) that feared od, Jewes, and of al people that vvere under heauen. Act. 2, 5. as also that the text ayth, they all heard them speak, every man in his owne tongue, wherein they vvere orne. Act. 2, 8 — 11. among vvhom were the Medes, as is aforesaid. Act. 2, 9. As touching Iudah, the Prophet Ieremie and the historie shevv how ey also for their idolatrie, backsliding, & other sinnes, were cast out of e Lords sight and presence, when they vvere caried into captivitie out of the nd of Canaan, Jer. 15, 1, 2. 2 King. 24, 20. and 25 chap. And Esay speaking of Gods favour after his punishing of them saith, Thou shalt forget the shame of y youth (the opprobry suffred of the Egyptians, when they kept thee in ard bondage) and shalt not any more remember the reproach of thy vvidowhood vvhich thou undergoes in the servitude and captivitie of Babylon.) For y maker is (or, will be) thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name, and thy redeemer e Holy one of Israell, the God of the whole earth shall he be called. For the Lord hath lled (or will call) thee as a woman forsaken, and grieved in spirit, & a wife of youth, vvhen thou vvast refused, saith thy God. For a small moment haue I forsaken thee, but with great mercyes vvil I gather thee. &c. Esa. 54, 4 — 7. And againe he saith: Thou alt no more be termed, Forsaken, neyther shall thy land any more be termed, Deso∣te: but thou shalt be called, Hephzi-bah (my delight is in her) and thy land, eulah (maried:) for the Lord deliteth in thee, and thy land shalbe maried. For as a ung man marieth a virgin, so shallAs a lād becoming destitute of her inhabi∣tants, may be said to be a wi∣dow: so a∣gain a land replenished vvith her inhabitants may be said to be mari∣ed. thy sonnes marry thee: and as the bridegrome re∣yceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoyce over thee. Esa. 62, 4, 5. Where note, ovv Iudah, being caried into captivitie, and shut up in exile for a tyme,  said, to be cast out of Gods sight, and counted a vvidovv, refused, forsaken, deso∣te, unmaried, &c. As Shemajah the Prophet, said of old to Rehoboam and e Princes of Iudah, vvhen they forsook the lavv of the Lord, Thus saith e Lord, ye haue forsaken (or left) me: and therefore haue I also forsaken (or left) u in the hand of Shishak, king of Egypt. 2 Chron. 12, 1, 5. & as Zechariah like∣wise, when vvrath came upon Iudah and Ierusalem, because they served oues & idols, said unto them, Why transgresse ye the commandements of the Lord, at ye cannot prosper? because ye haue forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you. 2 Chron. 24, 17 — 20. By vvhich Scriptures compared together, we may learne hovv to understand, those speaches, of being a Widovv, refused, forsa∣ken, cast out of Gods sight, &c. in regard of their being put out of the land of Canaan, giuen up into their enemies hand, caried into captivitie, detey∣ned in exile, and so exposed to manifold calamities, justly inflicted and ought upon them, for their idolatrie & other transgressions. For other∣wise it is true, which is also said by Ieremiah the Prophet, that Israell hath t ben forsaken (as a vvidow) nor Iudah of his God, of the Lord of hostes: though eir land was filled vvith vvasting from the Holy one of Israell. Ier. 51, 5. So in one spect they were forsaken, and bare the reproach of vvidowhood, when for eir sinnes God put them out of his land, and delivered them into the ands of their enemies, to be their captiues and exiles: and in another
respect they vvere not forsaken as a vvidovv of the Lord, vvho yet remem∣bred his gracious covenant, to shevv them mercy accordingly. And thus both are true, being rightly understood. Which Ezechiell also maketh plaine in his prophecie, Ch. 16, and 20, & 23. Some particulars whereof (because they giue great light about the estate of Israell and Iudah, and Gods dealing with them) I will therefore here set dovvne:Ezec. 23, 1 2, 3, 4, &c. yet vvishing the Reader to peruse the whole Chapters, and to obserue them well. The vvord of the Lord (saith Ezechiell, when he prophecied against the Iewes that yet remayned in the Land, in the time of king Zedechiah) came unto me, saying: Sonne of man, there were two wo∣men, the daughters of one mother: And they committed whoredome in Egypt, they committed whoredome in their youth: there were their brests pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginitie. And the names of them vvereIsraell. Aholah the elder, &Iudah. Aholibah her sister: & they vvere mine, and they bare sonnes and daughters: thus were their names, Samaria isThat is, her owne tent. Aholah, and IerusalemThat is, my tent in her. Aholibah. And Aholah played the harlotHebr. Vnder me. As Num. 5, 19, 20. vvhen she was mine, and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyri∣ans her neighbours, &c. Neyther left shee her whoredomes brought frō Egypt, &c. Wherefore I haue delivered her into the hand of her Lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted, &c. Ezec. 23, 1 — 10 And when her sisterIudah. v. 22. Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her in∣ordinate loue then she, and in her vvhoredomes more then her sister in her whoredomes. She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, &c. The I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way: and that she in∣creased her whoredomes, &c. then my mynd was alienated from her, like as my mynd was alienated from her sister. Yet she multiplied her whore∣domes, &c. Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I vvill raise up thy lovers against thee, from vvhom thy mynd is alienated and I vvill bring them against thee on everie side; the Babylonians & al the Chaldeans, Pekod, & Shoah, & Koa, & al the Assyrians with thē. &c. And I will set my jelousie against thee,v. 25. M. Junius calleth this a divorce in his Com∣mentar. on Ezech. 23.25.28. v. 30. & they shall deale furiously with thee; they shall take avvay thy nose and thyne eares, & thy remnant shal fall by the sword: they shall take thy sonnes and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire: they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, & take away thy faire Iewels, &c. For thus saith the Lord God, I wil deliver thee into the hand of them vvhom thou hatest, &c. and the shall deale vvith thee hatefully, and shall take avvay all thy labour, and shall leaue thee naked and bare, and the nakednes of thy vvhoredome shall be discovered, both thy levvdnes and thy vvhoredomes. I will doe these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the Hea∣then,v. 31. v. 35. because thou art polluted with their idols. Thou hast vvalked in the vvay of thy sister, therefore vvill I giue her cup into thy hand. &c. There∣fore thus saith the Lord God, Because thou hast forgotten me, & cast me behinde thy back, therefore beare thou also thy levvdnes, & thy whore∣domes.v. 36. The Lord said moreover unto me, Sonne of man, wilt thouOr plead for, defend, excuse, &c. judge
udge Aholah and Aholibah? yea declare unto them their abominati∣s: that they haue committed adulterie,v. 37. v. 38. and blood is in their hands, & ith their idols haue they committed adulterie, & haue also caused their onnes, whom they bare unto me, to passe for them through the fire to evoure them. Moreover this they haue done unto me, they haue defiled y Sanctuarie in the same day, & haue profaned my Sabbaths, &c. Then id I unto her that vvas old in adulteries,v. 43. Wil they now commit vvhore∣omes vvith her, and she with them. Yet they vvent in unto her, as they oe in unto a woman that playeth the harlot:v. 44. v. 45. so went they in unto Aho∣h and unto Aholibah the levvd vvomen. And the righteous men, they hall judge them after the maner of adulteresses, and after the maner of vvomen that shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is in heir hands. For thus saith the Lord God,v. 46. I vvill bring a companie upon em, & will giue them to be removed & spoyled, &c. Eze. 23, 11 — 47, &c. itherto Ezekiel the Prophet. Where novv againe I might aske of these en, whether they think of Judah in this estate, as they doe of Israell, that e Lord was not the God of Iudah, nor they his church and people; that the covenant novv was broken as well on the Lords part, as on theirs; nd that circumcision reteyned among them, was not the Lords signe & oly institution, but a lying signe, a cursed and detestable sacrament, false and deceitfull in their use, and no better then the heathens superstiti∣ns, &c. But I will leaue these things to be pondered by the discreet Rea∣er: and vvill not still mention and inferre them, as I might almost upon every verse. Also in the 20 chap. of Ezechiell (vvhen certain of the Elders of Israell came to the Prophet,Ezech. 20. to inquire of the Lord, &c.) after declaration of the Iewes former idolatries and rebellions.ver. 5. in Egypt;ver 10. in the vvildernes; and in  the land of Canaan:ver. 27. the Lord then speaketh thus unto themver. 33. v. 35. As I liue th the Lord God, Surely vvith a mightie hand, and with a stretched out me, and vvith furie powred out, vvill I rule over you, &c. And I vvill ring you into the wildernes of the people, and there vvill I plead vvith u face to face. Like as I pleaded in the wildernes of the land of Egypt,v. 36. v. 37. v. 38. so vvil I plead vvith you, saith the Lord God. And I wil cause you to passe under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant. And I vvill purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgresse against me: I vvill bring them forth out of the countrey vvhere they so∣urne, and they shall not enter into the land of Israell, and ye shal know that I am the Lord. As for you, O house of Israel,v. 39. thus saith the Lord od, Goe ye, serue ye everie one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye vvill not hearken unto me: but pollute ye myne holy Name no more with your gifts, and with your Idols. &c. Ezech. 20, 1 — 39. &c. And in the 16 chap. the same Prophet also vvriteth thus.Ezec. 16. ver. 1. v. 2. v. 3. The word of the rd came unto me saying: Sonne of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, & , Thus saith the Lord God unto Ierusalem; Thy birth and thy nativi∣ is of the land of Canaan, thy father vvas an Amorite, and thy mother
an Hittite.v. 4. And as for thy nativitie in the day that thou wast borne, thy navel vvas not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee, &c. And so the Prophet proceeding, sheweth firstv. 3, 4, 5. the miserable estate of Je∣rusalem in the Ievves themselues, together vvithv. 1 — 14 Gods special loue decla∣red unto them; and thenver. 15. &c. "her abominable vvhoredome & other finnes, matchingv. 44, 45. her mother, and exceedingv. r. 46, &c. her sisters, Sodome and Samaria, toge∣ther vvithv. 36-58. her heavy judgment thereupon: and so finally in the end ma∣keth this conclusion, saying:Eze. 16. ver. 59. Thus saith the Lord God, I wil euen deale with thee as thou hast done, vvhich hast despised the oath in breaking the co∣venant. Neverthelesse I vvill remember my Covenant vvith thee in the dayes of thy youth, & I vvill establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. Then thou shalt remember thy vvaies and be ashamed, vvhen thou shalt receiue thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger, and I vvill giue them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy Covenant. And I vvill establish my co∣venant vvith thee, and thou shalt knovv that I am the Lord: That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more: because of thy shame, vvhen I am pacified toward thee, for al that thou hast done, saith the Lord God. Ezec. 16 chap. And hitherto of these things in Ezechiell the Prophet: of vvhich sort he hath many the like. Psa. 74, & 79, & 80. &c.Wherevvith also agreeth that which is vvritten in divers of the Psalmes hereabout. And namely, in the 89 Psalme, vvhich (as some other of the Psalmes) treateth of the time and estate of the Ievves in the captivitie of Babylon. WherePsal. 89. the Prophet speaking of the stability of Gods cove∣nant and promise made unto David, and of the eternity of his seed and kingdome; and therevvithall annexing a denunciation of judgment up∣on the transgressours of the covenant: the Psalme then (speaking in the person of the Lord) sings it thus:Psal. 89.28 — 34. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore and my covenant shal stand fast vvith him. His seed also vvil I make to endure for ever and his throne as the dayes of heauen. If his children forsake my Lavv, and vvalk in my judgements: If theyHebr. profane. break my Statutes and keep not my Commandements. Then vvill I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquitie vvith stripes. Ne∣verthelesse my loving kindnes vvill I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my faithful to faile. My covenant vvill I notHebr. profane. break; nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lippes. &c. Psal. 89, 28 — 34. &c. Now how plainly these Scriptures lead us, to obserue a double conside∣ratiō of the Iewes & people of God, in cases of apostasie (as I haueAdvert. p. 59. 60. 61. &c. other where in some particulars noted heretofore) One in respect of thēselues another in respect of the Lord: One, in respect of the covenāt which the sinfully break on their part; another, in respect of the covenant which the Lord faythfully keepeth on his part: One, in respect of the covenant  vvorks; another, in respect of the covenant of grace: One, in respect o the truths & favours of God still enjoyed among thē; another in respect of their transgressions & mixture of their ovvn inventions & profanat¦ons vvithall, &c. I wil not here further prosecute, but leaue it to the con¦sideratiō & judgment of others: Wishing al such as haue opposed or ha
rejudice hereabout, novv carefully to obserue and regard these things; east othervvise they runne into errour upon errour more and more, de∣eiving and being deceived, and so receiue from the Lord a just recom∣ence of their obstinacie and opposition. Hovv also some of the Scriptures aforesaid, may vvithall haue refe∣rence to the calling againe of the Iewes (now to come) I vvill not here nter to speak thereof: but will keep to the question in hand, concerning he estate of Israell in defection, from Ieroboams time & forvvard, so long s God let them remain in his land, the land of Canaan, the land of pro∣mise, &c. All which time both Israel and Iudah were stil by the Prophets alled and accounted the people of the Lord, and haue such dueties re∣quired of them, such reproofs and exhortations giuen them, and such hings done for them and concerning them, as belong particularly to such as are the church and covenanted people of God. As I haue by sun∣ry instances here before shewed out of the Prophets & historie of the cripture: which I need not againe to repeat.P. 58. &c. And hitherto concerning er. 3, 8. Touching Hos. 2.2. The next Scripture here alledged, is Hos. 2.2. vvhich for sundry questi∣ons touching churches in apostasie may wel be observed: so it be rightly done. The vvords are these,Hos. 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Say ye unto your brethren,That is my people. Ammi,, and to your sisters,That is, having ob∣teyced mer∣cy. Ruhamah. Plead vvith your mother, plead;Or, that shee is not. for she is not my vvife, nor I her usband:Or, that she put a∣way. let her therefore put avvay her vvhoredomes out of her sight, and her adul∣teries from betvveen her brests, Least I strip her naked, and st her as in the day that she vvas borne, and make her as a wildernes, and set her like a drie land, and slay her with thirst. And I vvill not haue mercy upon her children, for they be the children of whore∣domes. For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I vvill goe after my lovers that giue me my bread & my water, my wooll and my flax, myne oyle and my drink. &c. To finde out the meaning hereof the better, let us consider, both what vvent before, and what fol∣loweth after in this Prophecie it self; and vvhat further light other Scri∣ptures compared herevvith will afford hereabout. First therefore (to be∣gin vvith that vvhich goes before in this prophecy) obserue and remem∣ber still the time when Hosea prophecied: vvhich wasHos. 1, . in the dayes of Vzziah; otham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah kings of Iudah, & in the dayes of Ieroboam the sonne of oash king of Israel: who was the thirteenth king after Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, that caused Israell to sinne. Next, mark hovv the Lord novv said to Hoseah the Prophet,Hos. 1, . Goe, take thee a wife of whoredomes, and children of whoredomes: for the land (of Israell) hath committed great vvhoredome, departing from the Lord: And how the Prophet went and did it Hos. 1.3. &c. That this is a type of Israels estate in Hoseahs time, none wil deny. And that here Israell is expressely termed a vvife, is evident, though yet a wife of whoredomes in that their estate. Novv the Lord then threatnerh for this spi∣ritual
whoredome of their idolatrie & sinful iniquities, to punish and cast thē avvay. And this also (to be done by degrees, if any way they could be brought to repentance) is declared by tipes of the children borne by this wife the harlot one after another. Whereof the first vvas calledHos. 1, 4. Jezreel, according to the name of a town in Israel because the calamity now pro∣phecied of Israel should begin whē Zachariah (the fourth frō Iehu) should be slain by Shallum, & so the kingdome be taken away frō Iehues house, for the slaughters that he made2 Kin. 9. & 10 ch. before in Iezreel, Hos. 1, 4, 5. The accōplish∣ment whereof, see in 2 Kin. 15, 8 — 12. And this fell out after the time of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash (the third from Iehu:) in whose dayes, Ho∣seah began to prophecy: as I noted before, Hos. 1, 1. with 2 King. 14, 23, 29. and 15, 8. &c. So this vvas not yet performed, when Hoseah thus prophe∣cied: but it vvas then to come. The second child vvhich vvas conceived & borne by this wife, was cal∣ledHos. 1.6. Lo-ruhamah (that is, not having obteyned mercy) noting that calami∣ty which came upon Israell, vvhen in the dayes of Pekah king of Israell Tiglath Pileser King of Assyria came and wasted the countrey beyond Iordan, carying avvay the Rubenites, Gadites, & half tribe of Manasseh, 1 Chron. 5, 26. and took Iion, and Abel-beth-maachah, and Ianoah, & Ke∣desh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galile, all the land of Naphtali, and cari∣ed them captiue to Assyria. 2 King. 15, 29. with Hos. 1, 6. And this also vvas then to come, vvhen Hoseah thus prophecied. The third child, borne by this vvife vvas called,Hos. 1, 9. Lo-ammi (that is, not my people) noting the third & great calamitie, which came in the dayes of Hoseah the last king of Israel, when the whole kingdome of the tenne tribes vvas overthrovvne by Salmanasser, king of Assyria, & the Israelites cast out of the Lords land, & scattered amōg the nations, as if they vvere not the Lords people, but accounted as the Gentiles. 2 King. 17, 3 — 6. &c. with Hos. 1, 9. And this likewise vvas yet to come, vvhen Hosea thus pro∣phecied thereof. Novv the first chapter having these types and prophecies, vve may ob∣serueHos. 2. ch. the second chapter accordingly to haue the application thereof especially of the last of them, to the estate of Israel. In the former part of vvhich chapter there is a denunciation, of the rejection of Israell, and of casting of them out of the land, vvith other afflictions accompanying the same: because of their spirituall adulterie and idolatrie. Which is set downe by similitude of the divorce of an adulteresse woman (so to call it, asPisator. Anal. n Hos 2, &c. some vvriters doe:) a divorce, I say, vvhereby an adulteresse is put out of her husbands house, and deprived of the benefits which formerly she enjoyed therein: vvhereof many particulars be here mentioned: as novv by the Prophet they vvere threatned against them. So then the wife of whoredomes (spoken of chap. 1, 2.) is the Congregation of Israel, the mother (spoken of chap. 2.2. to vvhom the Lord vvould not novv be an husband to protect her, because she vvas not a loyall wife but played the harlot. Thus now she is a wife, and not a vvife. She is
vvife, but a wife of whoredomes, Hos. 1, 2. She is not a vvife, that doth de∣eane her self loyally as she should, but hath her adulteries between her rests. Hos. 2, 2. To vvhich purpose also may be observed, that the Lord vouchsafeth etHos. 2, 2. to plead with her, as vvithCh. 1, 2. a wife of whoredomes; to exhort and require er toCh. 2, 2. put away her whoredomes out of her sight, &c. to threaten her (as he did Iudah also) that elsv. 3, &c. he vvil strip her naked,Ezec. 23, 25, 26, 29, &c. and set her as in the day that shee was orne, that is, depriue her wholly of her ornaments and blessings (so then they vvere not yet all taken avvay:) and that he would bring her into as miserable estate, as when she was in bondage in Egypt: at which time, in the midst of all her miserie, he took pitty on her, and made her his vvife: and endewed her with many excellent gifts and blessings; and brought her into the land of Canaan, and into his house and dvvelling place: Out of which now he would thrust her againe, and depriue her of all his mer∣cies and blessings there enjoyed. Hos. 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. with Ezec. 16, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. &c. Now this being but threatned here, vvas not yet performed▪ And difference is to be put betvveen a threatning (as here is made) & the performance or execution thereof: which followed after. As we haue hewed here before, out of the historie: 2 King. 17 chap. Els men might al∣ think that Iudah was not the wife of God, nor he her husband, in Eze∣chiels time: by whom the Lord calleth her an harlot, and more corrupt in whoredomes then Israell, and threatneth against her (as here he doth by Hoseah against Israell) that he will strip her out of her clothes & take away her faire jevvels, and leaue her naked and bare: &c. Ezec. 16, 35-59. d 23, 4, 11, 26, 29, 36, 44, 45. with Hos. 1, 2. and 2, 2, 3. Or if we should here understand it otherwise, yet this stil is evident, that the ProphetHos. 1, 9. vvith ch. 2 & 3, & 9, &c. first speaketh of the birth of Lo-ammi (not my people) Hos. 1, 9. afore he saith, Plead with your mother, that she is not my wife, nor I her husband; that she put away her whoredomes, least I strip her naked, &c. Hos. 2, 2, 3. &c. And both by the pro∣phecy & historie appeareth (as is shewed before) that the time & estate of this Lo-ammi, was yet to come: it typing out that time and calamitie of theirs, vvhen the Lord droue them out of his house, and cast them out of his land, and gaue them up into the hands of Salmanasser and Esar∣addon kings of Assyria, when now their kingdome was quite over∣rowne, and themselues captived and caryed away out of Canaan (the and of promise) into the polluted lands of the heathen nations, &c. So as is then toucheth not the question it self, which is concerning the estate of Israell, vvhiles they remayned in the land, being now fallen into defe∣on, as is aforesaid. Some (I knovv) there are, who take it, thatHierom. Zanchius, Mercerus, &c. on Hos. 1. &c. by Iezreel (the first childe re spoken off) is meant, the captivitie brought upon part of the tenne bes, by Tiglath Pileser aforesaid: and by Lo-ruhamah (the second child) e captivitie of all the ten tribes by Salmanasser: and by Lo-ammi (the ird child) that estate of theirs, when being thus punished, and not yet enting, they vvere in the end rejected from being the people of God,
and accounted as the Gentiles, among vvhom they vvere vvanderers. Or that ‡ by Jezreel (the first child) was meant the captivitie of the ten tribes by Salmanassar aforesaid, vvhen they vvere caried out of their land, and dispersed among the nations: and by Lo-ruchamah, their estate afterwaad in captivitie, when they found not mercy vvith the Lord, vvhich yet he would haue shewed unto them, if they had repented & turned unto him: and by Lo-ammi, that time and estate of theirs, when after all the former punishments, and forbearance of the Lord, they not yet repenting, vvere novv no longer accounted his people, but rejected and esteemed as the heathen: And accordingly they make this second chapter (vvhereabout vve treat) an explication of that vvhich went before in the first chapter: And so apply it now also to the estate of the Ievves generally, since their refusall of Christ and his Gospell. Which then is the more against these men: and stil shevveth that this perteynes not to the question in contro∣versy, concerning Israels estate, before their dispersion, vvhiles yet they were in the land of Canaan, & not made wanderers among the Gentiles. Novv to come to such things, as follow after in this prophecy; I could here at first insist upon the very next vvords, inHos. 2, 2.3. &c. this verse, and the verses follovving: let her therefore put away her whoredomes out of her sight, least I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that shee was borne, &c. Which plainely shew∣eth, that she vvas not yet brought to this passe, but was thus threatned, to bring her to repentance, or leaue her the more vvithout excuse: as in such pleading & dealing is commonly used: like as I noted here before touching Iudah also, out of Ezec. 16, and 20, and 23 chap. I could moreover out of this chapter it self, compare vvithHos. 2.2, vvith v. 13 &. 16. this verse, that vvhich is vvritten in the 13 & 16 verses follovving. vvhere it is said, I wil visit upon her the dayes of Baalim, &c. Hos. 2, 13. And it shalbe at that day, sayth the Lord, that thou shalt  me Isht, and shalt call me no more Baali. For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembred by their name. Hos. 2, 16, 17. & so comparing these together, leaue it to the Reader, to consider whether the meaning here may not be this (agreeable to some things aforesaid:) Plead vvith your mother, that she is not Ishti, my vvife, and that I am not Isha, her husband: because she calleth me not Ishi, my husband, that is, doeth not vvorship me synceerly vvithout mixture of Idolatry, as she should, and as I her husband haue appointed her to doe: but calleth me Baali, my Lord, that is,Like as novv the Papists vvorship God in & by their i∣mages, &c. worship¦peth me as her Lord or husband in and by Baal, and such like Idols, &c From vvhich hovv ever she vvill not be dravvn, vvhiles she remayneth i this estate: yet I shall hereafter cause her to leaue it, and to cleaue unto me and serue me in sincerity, when I shall by corrections and by my vvord and spirit bring her to repentance and amendement. Hos. 2, 2. vvi ver. 13 — 16. &c. Where note, that the vvord Baali is in it selfxo. 21, 3 De. 24.4. 2 . 21, 26 (vvhere th Jo and Baal is sed to note out the  and)  3.23.  8. a good terme (signifying my Lord, or, my husband:) but because it vvas a vvord, not kep peculiar to husbands, but made common to Idols, unto vvhich it vvas ap∣plie I and abused in Idolatrie, therefore vvould not the Lord so be called nor so be vvorshipped vvith a mixt and adulterate kind of service and
orship, &c. Neyther doeth the Lord blame & punish this onely in Is∣ell, but in Iudah also, and all the tribes together: who vvere likevvise uilty of the same transgression, of vvorshipping Baal, as Israell was. As ay be seen throughout the Scriptures: Iud. 2, 13. and 8, 33. 2 King. 21, 3.  Chron. 24, 7. and 28, 2. Ier. 2, 2, 8, 23. and 7, 9. and 9, 14. and 11, 13, 17. and 19, 5. d 23, 13, 27. and 32, 29, 35. Zeph. 1, 4. Of these things (as I said) I could in∣st: but I vvill proceed to other things following in this Prophecie. And here first obserueHos. 3 ch. the next chapter, & therein the very next pro∣hecie of Hoseah, following after the other aforesaid. Where the Lord ovv again giving another type, said unto him,v. 1, &c. Goe yet, loue a vvoman (be∣ved of herOr, hus∣band, as it is trāslated Ier. 3, 20. friend, yet an adulteresse) according to the loue of the Lord tovvard the ildren of Israell, who look to other Gods, and loue flagons of vvine. &c. Where eve∣ sentence of the prophecie is a convictiō of their manifold errors. The ord had before said to Hoseah,Hos. 1, 2, &c. Goe, take a wife of vvhoredomes, &c. ch. 1.  2. Now after that vvhereof he spake both in the first & second chap∣ter, he saith unto him again, Goe yet, notvvithstanding that thou hast done before, in taking a vvife of vvhoredomes &c. Goe yet, I say, and loue a vvo∣n beloved of her husband, yet an adulteresse. &c. And vvho novv is typed out by this vvoman? The Lord himself shevveth, it is the children of Israell. And vvho is this friend or husband, that loveth this vvoman. He saith expressely s the Lord that loveth the children of Israel? What also is this vvomans adul∣terie? He, shevveth it likevvise as plainly to be Israels looking to other Gods, and loving flagons of wine; that is, intentiuely vvorshipping idols, & delight∣fully frequentingExo. 32, 5, 6. vvith 1 Cor. 10, 7. Num. 25 2. vvith Psal. 106, 28. the banketting feasts, that vvere kept in honour of those their Idols. And hovv very evident novv are all these particulars? If then the Prophet did in deed meane before, that Israell (being yet  the land of Canaan) was not any way to be esteemed the Lords vvife, r he her husband: hovv then saith he here, that she is yet beloved of e Lord, being an idolatresse, as the woman that is loved of her husband ing an adulteresse? May we think that the Prophet contradicteth him∣f, as these men usually doe thēselues? God forbid. Or doeth this type ntradict the former, where she is calledHos. 1, 2. a vvife of whoredomes? Or doth  contradict the Prophet Ieremie, vvho also speaking of Israels idola∣us defection from the Lord, saith thus,Jer. 3, 20 Surely as a wife tretcherously de∣teth from herHebr. frend. husband: so haue you dealt tretcherously with me, O house of Israel,  the Lord. Jer. 3, 20. Why also doth the Prophet in this same chapter (when again he threat∣th their exile) speak of it in the time to come, saying,Hos. 3, 4. The children of Is∣ shall abide many daies without a King, and vvithout a prince, and vvithout a sacri∣ and vvithout an image, and vvithout an Ephod, and vvithout Teraphim. &c. Why th he not in the present time, The children of Israel doe novv sit without a , and vvithout a sacrifice, &c. but that novv he denounced what vvas yet come, & did not declare what vvas upon them already in this behalf?  as yet they had their king, and their sacrifices, statutes, and Tera∣m, &c. and so had yet in their ovvne land, among themselues, the face
of a church and common vvealth: though adulterate and corrupt. Hos. 3, 4. vvith 1, 1. and 9, 3. and 2 King. 14, 23.24. and 15, 8, 9, 17, 18, 24, 27, 28. and 17.1, 2. Yea,Zachari∣ah, Shal∣lum, Mena∣hem, Peka∣chiah, Pe∣kah, Ho∣shea. six kings reigned in Israel, after Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash in vvhose dayes Hoseah prophecied. Hos. 1, 1. vvith 2 King. 14, 29. and 15, 8. 13, 16, 23, 27, 30. But the time vvas now a comming (as here he threatneth) vvhen they should beHos. 9, 3.12, 15, 17. driuen out of the Lords land, house, and presence, and beEsa. 7, 8. so broken, as they should not novv be a people; butHos. 3, 4. cease to haue their owne politie and kingdome, as hitherto they had enjoyed it in their ovvne land. Which accordingly came to passe afterward. 2 King. 17 ch. Finally note here (by this occasion) whether the latter part of the third verse of this chapter, may not be translated thus, Thou shalt not be for an other man, neyther also vvill I be for thee (or, vvith thee:)dler.  repeating the nega∣tiue particle in the latter clause: as al interpreters usually doe, in Psa. 9, 18. or (as some translations haue it) ver. 19. Which then also will haue his vvaight for the matter in hand. And the more, considering that the Lord othervvhere in this prophecy denounceth this Woe against them, saying Woe unto them, vvhen I depart from them, Hos. 9, 12. And hitherto of this Chap∣ter, and the type conteyned therein: vvhich about this question is much to be observed. Leaue we novv this chapter, and come to the other following, we find therein that this Prophet himself doeth still afterward throughout his prophecie stile themMy peo∣ple. which sheweth that the o∣ther (of Lo¦ammi Hos 1, 9.) was a prophecy, & not yet performd. Ammi, & acknowledge them yet stil to be the peo∣ple of the Lord, and the Lord to be their God, applying unto them the terme of the covenant, & from thence deducing sundry arguments of reproof and exhortation: according as his calling and their estate required: A namely about their idolatrous worship; marying vvith straungers; seeking unto th Assyrians and Egyptians, &c. Of which (because I haue spoken †here befor and shall haue occasion hereafter to note some things againe out of thi Prophet) I will not now therefore insist upon the particulars: but onel refer the reader to these and the like places in this prophecy: to be com∣pared also vvith the like in other of the Prophets:Pag. 61, 62, 63. viz. Hos. 4, 6, 8, 12. and  4, 6, 7, 13. and 6, 4, 5, 6, 7. and 7, 8, 10, 11. and 8, 1, 8, 9, 11, 12. and 9, 3, 15. and 11 7. and 12, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 14. and 13, 4, 5, 11, 13, 16. and 14, 1. And thus much her of things to be observed out of this prophecy it self. Now if we compare herewith, the historie and other Prophets, muc more light vvill yet appeare hereabout. The historie speaking of B¦sha (the third king from Jeroboam the sonne of Nehat) noteth hovv the wo of the Lord came to Iehu the sonne of Hanani against Baasha, saying1 King. 16, 1, 2. Forasmuch as I haue exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my peop Israell, and thou hast vvalked in the vvay of Ieroboam, and hast made my people Israel sinne, &c. 1 Kin. 16, 1, 2. Which sheweth that the Lord now accounted I¦raell to be his people. As we haue the like,2 King. 9.6. in the Lords speach to Ie (the tenth king of Israell after Ieroboam:) to whom the Prophet annoi¦ting him said, Thus saith the Lord God of Israell, I haue annoynted thee king or the people of the Lord, euen over Israell. 2 King. 9, 6. Of which I haue spoke
hereP. 58. &c before more particularly. And most of all in the historie of Johoa∣z and Joash (the eleuenth and twelfth kings after Ieroboam) vvhere it  recorded, that vvhen Hazael king of Syria had oppressed Israell all the ayes of Iehoahaz,2 Kin. 13 23. the Lord was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, nd had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, and ould not destroy them, neyther cast he them from his presence as yet. 2 Kin. 13, 23. By which againe it appeareth that yet they vvere still accounted the Lords eople and he their God; who (notwithstanding their sinnes deserved otherwise, yet) was gracious unto them because of his covenant, and had not ast them from his presence as yet. Of vvhich also I haue spoken before. But hese things are of such waight & use about the questions in controver∣e, as we cannot ynough obserue and regard them, as we should: and in respect whereof I may wel omit other things that might be observed ut of the historie hereabout. For the Prophets; Amos, who prophecied as Hoseah did, in the ayes of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash (the thirteenth king from the other Ioroboam aforesaid) sheweth the same things both for mercy and udgment to Israel throughout his prophecy: and in the seuenth & eight chapters, under types & similitudes; other then those which Hoseah had,Amo. 7 ch. ut tending to one and the same end. As when,ver. 1, & 2. by grassehoppers formed by the Lord, he noteth out famine, or more easie incursions of enemies, to ome upon them. Amos 7, 1, 2. Andvst. 4. by the Lords calling to contend by fire, fi∣gureth out greater and heavier punishments; as the great troubles and aughters among themselues; and the sore vvarres and calamities that hould come upon them by forreine enemies, as by Tiglath-pileser, &c. Amo. 7.4, 5, 6. TheAmos 7, 2 — 6. mitigation of both vvhich judgments (that they were ot wasted up by them) Amos obteyneth of the Lord by prayer: where∣n he useth reasons respecting the covenant and mercy of the Lord: Of hich see before, pag. 63. And lastly,Amo. 7, 7, 8. by the Lords standing upon a wall try∣ by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand, &Chap. 8, 1, 2. by a basket of Summer fruit, &c. oresheweth the destruction of the kingdome of Israell, the end & over∣hrovv of their estate both ecclesiasticall & civill: vvhen the Lord would are them no longer, nor passe them over any more, but deliver them in∣o the hands of theSalmanas∣sar, & E∣sar-Had∣don. 2 Kin. 17. Ezr. 4, 2. kings of Assyria, to be ruinated, wasted, and caryed way out of their owne land, &c. Amo. 7, 7, 8, 9, 11, 17. Which how fitly & irectly it agreeth with the prophecy & types of Hoseah, mentioned be∣ore, and vvith the historie it self, I need not stand here to declare, having  lately spoken thereof. Onely by the way let me vvish the Reader here to obserue, how the ord hath a plumbline in his hand, which when he set in the midst of his eople Israell, trying out theit uneuenes and incorrigible iniquitie, he ould not then passe by them any more, but overthrew their estate, and rought upon them their deserved punishment: like as aAmo. 7, 7, 8. vvith Psal. 62, 3. Esa. 30, 13. vvall that be∣g tryed by a plumbline, & found to be uneuen, bovved, & swolne with reaches that cannot be amended, is therefore overturned and throvvne
dovvne. Thus teaching all Churches and people, to be carefull in time to redresse their erroneous and sinfull vvayes and courses, and in all things to conforme themselues and their estate according to the word of God, least otherwise the Lord comming to take the plumbline in his hand, and finding their estate to be uneuen and incorrigible, he then spare them no longer, but bring upon them condigne punishment: as he dealt of old vvith his people Israell, and since hath done the like with divers christian Churches from time to time. But to returne to the point in hand, the Prophet Esay maketh the mat∣ter yet more playne, when (prophecying in the dayes of Ahaz, as Hoseah also did) he limiteth the time expressely from that day forward, saying: Within threescore and fiue yeres, shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. Esa. 7, 1, 8. with Hos. 1, 1, 9. and 3, 4. and with Deut. 32, 21. So yet then it was not done. Which Hoseah also often shewed, both by the types before spoken off; & more expressely, when speaking of Israel, he saith in plain termes, speaking of the time yet to come,Hos. 9, 17. My God will cast them avvay, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations. Where, there is a denunciation of exile & rejecting of them by the Lord; as had ben before in the first, second, and third chapters of this Prophecy: So plainly signifying, that as yet it vvas not done: seing that yet they were not cast away by the Lord, nor made wanderers among the nations: but were yet still dwelling in the Lords land, vvhere and when Hoseah thus prophecyed unto them. Which is made evident yet further, vvhen the Prophet in the same chapter threatneth also for time to come, saying,Hos. 9, 3. They shall not dwell in the Lords land; but Ephraim shall returne to Egypt, and they shall eat uncleane things in Assyria, &c. And,ver. 12. Woe unto them, vvhen I depart from them. And moreover again,ver. 15. For the vvickednes of their doings I vvill driue them out of myne house; I wil loue them no more. So then hitherto the Lord had loved them, and was not departed from them, but shewed compassion upon them, and kept them in his ovvn land, as in his house and presence, & had not yet driuen them from thence to be vvanderers in other lands: &c. Which when the Lord afterward brought upon them, then was the bill of divorce giuen, where∣ofIer. 3, 8. Ieremie speaketh: vvhich was also thus foretold by Hoseah and the other Prophets, as is aforesaid. But what is this to the point of the question in hand, vvhich is not touching the condition aftervvard; but concerning their circumcision & estate, from the time af Ieroboams apostasie, whiles they were yet in the kind, as in the Lords house and presence: and so in deed, before the bill of divorce was giuen them, and they cast out of the Lords house and pre∣sence? In vvhich time, how graciously the Lord dealt with them, and re∣spected his covenant towards thē; & how the Prophets esteemed them, and dealt vvith them, as vvith the people of God, the Scripture every where shevveth, as we haue here before specified. Which how these men vvill ever make to accord vvith their assertions, let the time mani∣fest,
and such as are judicious obserue. And novv that I am here speaking of the Prophets, I could also note out of Ezekiel, how the Lord bade him lye on his side,Ezec. 4, 4, 5, 6.. and beare the ini∣quitie of Israell three hundred and ninety dayes: that is (reckning a day for a yere) 390 yeres: the Lord so noting out his long sufferance and bea∣ring with his people, notwithstanding their idolatrie, before he cast them off. Ezec. 4, 4, 5, 6. But hovv should this be verifyed, if the Lord himself brake covenant with them and cast them off, vvhen they fell into Idola∣try, vvith Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat? Nay, seeing these yeres of Gods long sufferance began with Ieroboams reigne and falling into apostasie, (asMr. Brought. Consent of Scripture. some reckon them) or about the seuen and tvventieth yere of Salo∣mons reigne, when he declined to idolatrie, 1 Kin. 11.4 (asM. Juni∣us annot. Ezec. 4, 4, 5. others think) and ended with the last captivitie and carying avvay of the Iewes by Ne∣buchadnezer: this doth directly confirme the particulars, vvhich I haue here before alledged against the objections aforesaid. Besides that this same Prophet,Ezec. 16, and 23 ch. othervvhere sheweth (as I haue notedPag. 74, &c. here before) that Iudah by her idolatrie and iniquitie, justified her sister Israel. So as if by their ido∣latrie, the covenant vvas also broken on Gods part, and circumcision a∣mong them become a lying signe and detestable sacrament: then must it likewise be in Iudah: And vvhere then was the Church of God, and his ordinance of circumcision, if it was neyther with Israell nor Iudah? But Ieremy saith, that Israel was not forsaken, nor Iudah of his God, of the Lord of hosts, though their land was filled with sinne against the holy one of Israel. And Hoseah (no doubt) contradicteth not the other Prophets. So as then vve must still remember, to distinguish betvveene the breach of the covenant on the peoples part, together with the speaches of the Prophets that are spoken in that respect: and between the breaking & regarding of the covenant on the Lords part, and the things spoken by the Prophets in that behalf. When Israell played the harlot, and brake the covenant on their part, yet the Lord bare vvith them a long time, & shewed compassion upon them, respecting the covenant on his owne part, which he in mercy had made with thē: as novv we haue seen out of the historie & Prophets aforesaid. It is also a commō thing vvith the Prophets to speak of things to come as if they vvere already done, because of the certainty of the fulfilling of them accordingly. As when Hoseah saith,Hos. 8, 8. Israell is swallowed up, nowMeaning they shall be. As the Translati∣ons haue it usually. they haue ben (or are) among the Gentiles, as a vessell wherein is no pleasure: vvhen as yet they dwelt in the Lords land, uncast out from thence: as he shevveth in the next chapter, and throughout his prophecie. Hos. 9, 3, 11, 12, 13, &c. Hoseah moreover was one of the last Prophets, that prophecyed to Is∣raell before their finall captivitie: and continued prophecying from the dayes of Vzziah, unto the raigne of Hezekiah; in the sixt yere of whose raigne, Israell vvas captived by Salmanassar king of Assyria: So he might now vvell speak of things as already done, which vvere so shortly & cer∣tainly to be fulfilled. And namely, of the things signified by the children aforesaid, succeding one after another, Jezreel, Lo-ruchamah, Lo-ammi. With
the last vvhereof (Lo-ammi, not my people) may that also agree, that she is not my wife, nor I her husband. Hos. 2, 2. with 1, 9. Yet himself that in the first chap∣ter thus foresheweth their estate, by the child named Lo-ammi, not my peo∣ple: doth notvvithstanding afterward stil cal thē Ammi, my people, through∣out his Prophecie; so teaching us hovv to esteem to them, until that was performed in deed, vvhich was thus foreshevved in figure. And again the Lord that by the Prophet saith in the second Chapter, Plead with your mo∣ther, that she is not my wife, nor I her husband; doth aftervvard in the third chap∣ter say to the same Prophet, Goe yet, loue a woman (beloved of herOr, hus∣band. frend, yet an adulteresse) according to the loue of the Lord toward the children of Israell, who look to other Gods, and loue flagons of wine. &c. And many the like might be shevved out of this and the other Prophets. In all vvhich vve must alway be care∣full so to understand the Prophets (if vve will understand them aright) as one place may agree with another, & not imply contradictions. For they neither contradict themselues, nor one another. And it hath alwaies ben a speciall fountaine of error and heresie, to take hold of the sound or let∣ter of some words in some places, without conferring them vvith other Scriptures, or having regard to the circumstances of the place it self, not so much as respecting vvhat goeth before, or followeth after, or the like. Finally, the Chaldee Paraphrase thus expoundeth that vvhich is writtē in Hos. 2, 2.Ionathae Chald. pa∣raphr. in Hos. 2, 1. Rebuke the congregation of Israell, and say unto her, that she submitteth not her self to my worship, therefore neither doethChrist. So this Pa∣raphrast often spea∣keth. my word accept of her prayers: un∣till she shall remoue her evil works out of her sight, and the worship which shee yeeldeth to idols out of the mids of her cities. Thus hath the Chaldee Paraphrase. Where marke if their exposition do not agree with the things aforesaid, & lead us so to understand this Scripture, as if it were said, Plead with your mother, that she is not my wife, nor I her husband: that is, that she doth not demeane & cary her self as becometh my vvife, in that she submitteth not unto my vvorship, vvhich I haue appointed her: therefore neither doe I shevv my self tovvards her as her husband, to receiue her requests in the time of her need, and accordingly to succour and protect her, &c. And it is not unknovvne among men, that sometimes such things and speaches fal out between maried persons, when yet notvvithstanding they remayne still man and wife together, untill there be a divorce and forsaking one of another. Neyther are such maner of phrases (in other cases) unusuall in the Scriptures, and common speaches of men. Ioh. 8, 39. Iob 17, 14. Pro. 7, 4. and 12, 4. Ier. 2, 27. Esa. 1, 10, 21. and 57, 3, 4. Ezech. 16, 3, 35, 44. &c. And note withall that the case both of all the tribes (vvhen they vvere together) & afterward of Iudah also was often such (as the Chaldee paraphrase here speaketh) that they submitted not to the vvorship of God, but followed idols & other Gods: vvhereupon the Lord many times refused to heare their prayers, and to protect them, as formerly he had done: and gaue them up into their enemies hand, time after time. Iud. 2, 12. &c. 2 Chro. 28, and 33 ch. Jer. 2, 13. and 7, 15, 16. and 11, 13, 14. and 14, 10, 11, 12. Esa. 57, 3 — 8. & 5, 2 — 7. Zach. 7, 12, 13, 14. Yet vvere they still the Lords vvife and people,
and he their God and husband: as I think these men themselues will not deny. And diversCalvin, Danaeus, &c. in Hos. 2, 2. good interpreters expounding this Scripture, doe so understand it, as thinking it agreeth with that which is writtē in Esa. 50, 1. (where the Prophet speaketh of Iudah, to vvhom the Lord had not giuen a bill of divorce) And vvith Ezec. 16 ch. spoken of before. AndDanaeus, ibid. some of them also compare it vvith Ier. 3, 8. vvhich speaketh of Israel, vvhen they vvere out of the land of Canaan, and giuen into the hands of the Assyri∣ans, &c. Whereof I haue treated here before more particularly. To conclude then, by that which hath ben said may appeare, how in thisHos. 2 ch. chapter there is a further explication & application ofBoth for the judge∣mēts threat¦ned & mercies promised. things spoken of in the former chapter; and that the several names, & times of the birth of the children (Hos. 1, 4.6, 9. there spoken of) follovving one after another by de∣grees, and being giuen as types unto Israell, doe necessarily shevv, that this people came not to beNot the Lords peo∣ple. Lo-ammi, when Ieroboam the sonne of Ne∣bat set up the calues, and Israell fell into idolatrie vvith him, but a long time aftervvard, as hath ben shevved before: Moreover, that whenHos. 1, 4. with v. 6, and 9. Jez∣reel vvas borne of Gomer the harlot (noting the avenging of the blood of Iezreel upon the house of Iehu, vvhich was about tvvo hundred yeres after Ieroboams apostasie) then Israell yet vvas Ruchamah, and Ammi still: And finally, that vvhen Israell, for their continuance in sinne, came to beHos. 1, 6 with ver. 8 & 9. Lo-ruchamah, unpittied, or not obteyning mercy (some of the tribes and cities being delivered up into the hands of Tiglath Pileser, &c.) yet vvere they Ammi still: and so continued untill the birth of the next child, when Go∣mer brought outHos. 1, 8.9. Loammi, not my people: vvhenas Israel was caryed away by Salmanasser out of the Lords land, driuen out of the Lords house, cast avvay by the Lord out of his presence, and made vvanderers among the heathen nations. As hath ben shevved heretofore out of the Prophets and historie, compared together. And hitherto of this Scripture, in Hos. 2, 2. and of the things that goe before and follovv after in the same Prophecie,2 King, 17. &c. & the like in other Scri∣ptures, concerning the question in hand. Of which I haue spoken the more largely: desiring that the right and true meaning of this and the other Prophets in these things may be found out, and rightly observed. Which novv (both for my self and others) I leaue to further considera∣tion: hoping that the right discerning and distinguishing of the things aforesaid, vvill giue us great light, both to direct us hovv to esteem of churches in apostasie, and to keep us from the aberrations that are now so common, both on the right hand and on the left: whiles some regard not the defection or corruptions of Churches, as they should, and others by reason thereof would presently and utterly make a nullitie of such Churches, or of the ordinances of God, yet remayning (though corrup∣ted) therein. Touching Hos. 13.1. The next Scripture here alledged, is out of the same Prophet, Hos. 13, 1.
vvhere the vvords are these,Hos. 13, 1. When Ephraim spake, trembling, he exalted himself (or, stirred it up) in Israell, but when he offended in Baal, he dyed. Of the diversi∣ty of the translation, and application of these vvords, I vvil not insist. One∣ly for the point in hand, obserue these things. First, that the same terme and phrase is used by Christ, speaking of the church of Sardis: when he saith to Iohn, Vnto the Angell of the church in Sar∣dis write, These things saith he that hath the seuen spirits of God, and the seuen starres: I know thy vvorks, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. Rev. 3, 1. Should we novv infer hereupon (as this man here doth upon the like phrase in the Prophets touching Israell) that therefore baptisme, and the other ordinances of God had in the church of Sardis, vvere but in shew retey∣ned therein, and could not be unto them the signes and seales of forgiuenes of sinnes, and of life eternall: and therefore vvere in their use of them, false and deceitful: as vvere the ordinances (as he saith) of God, reteined among the Gentiles? Would any man of heart and understanding, endure such blasphemie? Saith not the Scri∣pture, that the church of Sardis, vvas one of the seuen golden candlesticks shewed unto Iohn? And doth not Christ our Lord (who hath the seuen spirits of God, & vvhose eyes are as a flame of fire) accordingly approue it so to be? Rev. 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20. with 3, 1, &c. Far rather will I, with Christ & his Apostle, esteem it to be dead in some respect, & yet acknow∣ledge it a golden Candlestick, and true Church of God in other respect: then gather such maner of consequences, as this man usually doth up∣on any such phrases, that he meteth vvithall. And this is the more to be mynded touching this doctrine of his, because himself in the same trea∣tise affirmeth, thatAnimad. pag. 103. our reasons from Israell are impertinent to the estate of Rome (there spoken off) but might vvell serue for the times vvherein Iohn lived, vvhen the trueRev. 2, and 3 cha. Churches vvere many of them apostate. Where also he citeth in the mar∣gent, Rev. 2 and 3 chapters: and so this Church of Sardis for one. Where I might note againe his contradicting of himself, and his manifold errors in divers respects, if I vvould here stand thereupon. For if the estate of apostate Israell, may vvel serue the times of Iohn, when the true churches (spoken off in the Revelation, ch. 2, and 3.) vvere many of them apostate: then it cannot be that the estate and ordinances of God had in Israell should be such, asAnimad. p. 70 &c. in this other place, and throughout his treatise he would beare us in hand: Thē also should Israel be a true church, though in apostasie: as here himself calleth those churches in the Revelation, apostate, and yet true churches: Which by vvord and vvriting othervvhere he still oppugneth. That vvhich concerneth the church of Rome, may be touched othervvhere. In the meane time, we haue now ynough from these men themselues, seeing the church of Sardis, vvhich they say was apostate, and Christ saith vvas dead, is by themselues acknowledged to be a true church, & by the Scriptures approved for a golden candlestick. So al their pretences and oppositions vanish into smoke. Secondly, for the place of Hoseah it self, if it be understood, as (by put∣ting a vvord to the text) here they expound it, of death in sinne: yet let
it be vvell considered, vvhether it will therefore follow, that circumcision now in Israel was not the Lords signe, & his seale of forgiuenes of sinne, but a false and deceitfull signe in their use thereof, and no better then the ordinances of the heathen. The Scripture sheweth, how vvhen one be∣ing called of Christ to follow him, requested, saying,Luke. 9, 59, 60. Lord suffer me first to goe and bury my father: Christ said unto him again, Let the dead bury the dead: but goe thou and preach the kingdome of God: meaning, Let the dead spiritually bury those that are dead bodily. Shall we novv therefore hereupon ga∣ther, that the circumcision then had among the Iewes, vvas a false & de∣ceitful signe in their use thereof, and not the Lords seale of forgiuenes of sinne, and eternall life? Also vvhen Paul, speaking of widovves in the Church, saith,1 Tim. 1 3, 5, 6. Honour widowes that are vvidowes in deed, &c. Now she that is a widow in deed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications & prayers night and day: But she that liveth in pleasure, is dead while she liveth. Meaning, she that liveth the naturall life, but is dead vvith spiritual death. May we now in∣fer hereupon, that the baptisme had in the church of Ephesus (where Ti∣mothee thus vvritten unto,1 Tim. 1, 3. now was) or in any other of the Primitiue churches, wherein such widowes were, was not the Lords signe of the remission of sinnes and eternall life, but a lying & execrable signe in their use thereof, and no better then the heathens baptisme, or other observa∣tions of theirs? Shall the infidelitie of man make Gods trueth of none ef∣fect? Shall not God be true, though men be lyars? Shal not his signes & seales still be his true and holy ordinances, though eyther Churches ge∣nerally, or some particular persons that enjoy them, walk unworthy of them, abuse and corrupt both them and themselues? If some among this people that write shus, yea if the Congregation it self, vvherof these men themselues are, should be dead in sinne (havingRom. 16.17. Gal. 5, 19, 20. Heb. 10, 25 Iude v. 19. offended & scandalously divided themselues from the church whereof they vvere, asArrow against ido¦latrie. p. 4, 71. &c. they ac∣knovvledge that Israell did from Iudah, notwithstanding all their preten∣ces to the contrary:) will they therefore yeeld, that the baptisme had a∣mong them, is not the Lords ordinance, nor his signe & seale of forgiue∣nes of sinne, and of eternall life, but a lying and deceitfull signe in their use thereof, and no better then the heathens ordinances? Or if some in any Churches, euen in the best at this day, be found dead in their sinnes, will they therefore infer such consequences about the baptisme & other ordinances of God, had among them, that they are not the Lords signes and seales, but lying & deceitfull in their use thereof? The vvord of God it self, is by some made unto themselues the savour of death unto death: Is it not therefore in the Lords ordinance, the savour of life unto life? 2 Cor. 2, 14, 15, 16. So likevvise is it with the Lords supper, as the Apostle shevveth, 1 Cor. 11, 18 — 34. Yet may vve not therefore gather such conse∣quences thereupon, as these men doe about the question in hand. Thirdly, their exposition of the place aforesaid being admitted, it was then that Israell became dead in sinne, when they offended in Baal. But the vvorship of Baal in the ten tribes, vvas first instituted by Achab. 1 Kin. 16.
31, 32, 33. And Ahab was the seuenth king of Israell, and reigned, about threescore yeeres, after Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat that set up the Calues & caused Israell to sinne, 1 King. 12 — 16 chap. And there was great difference betweene Ieroboams calues, and Baals idolatrie: as appear∣eth both by Eliahs historie, vvho1 Kin. 18, 18. &c. directly & earnestly set himself against the Prophets of Baal, in Ahabs time, that first brought them into Israell and by Iehues historie, who2 King. 10, 28, 29. destroyed Baal out of Israell, and yet, from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat that caused Israell to sinne, he departed not from after thē, to wit, the golden calues, that were in Dan and Bethel. Will they now therefore graunt that Israell vvas aliue, and not dead in sinne, till Achabs time that they offended in Baal: and that the circumcision in Israell, was Gods seale, & no deceitfull signe, all the time betvveen Ieroboams reigne and Achabs, notwithstanding Ieroboams apostasie and setting up of the calues at Dan and Bethell? If they graunt this, then their assertion is overthrowne; If they deny it, vvhat then will they say to their ovvne allegation and expo∣sition of this Scripture, that when Israell offended in Baal, they became dead in sinne: seing Baals idolatrie vvas brought into Israell by Ahab, a good many yeeres after Ieroboams setting up of the calues: as I shevved here before. Fourthly, the Scripture sheweth, that in Eliahs time, there were King. 19, 18. seuen thousand in Israell, who bowed not the knee unto Baal. What now shall we say to these? Were they not circumcised? Or had they not the circumcision that was then in Israell? Or was it not unto them the Lords seale of for∣giuenes of sinne, and eternall life: but a false and deceitfull signe in their use, and no better then the ordinances reteyned among the Heathen: as here they speak of the circumcision then had in Israell? Or vvas this Sa∣crament of the Lord, being one and the same in it self, a true signe & seal unto these: but a lying signe and deceitfull seale unto others? Or doeth the trueth of Gods Sacraments depend on man, & not on the Lord him∣self? Or shall the sinne of man make the trueth of God to be a lye? Fiftly, the Scripture also shevveth, thatIer. 7, 2, 9. Judah burnt incense unto Baal, and walked after other Gods whom they knevv not. and again, that theyIre. 19, 3, 4, 5. forsook the Lord, and built the high places of Baal, to burne their sonnes with fire for burnt offrings unto Baal, &c. And moreover, that vvhen all the tribes vvere together, in the time of the judges, then alsoJudg. 2, 11, 12, 13. and 8, 33. the children of Israell forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. Will they now here againe inferre, as they doe touching the tenne tribes, that then circumcision and other ordinances of God novv had in Iudah, and beforetime in the dayes of the Iudges could not be unto them the Lords signe and seale of forgiuenes of sinnes, and of life eternall, and therefore vvere in their use of them false and de∣ceitfull, as vvere also the ordinances reteyned among the Gentiles? What shall we say to these things? Where then vvas circumcision had, that was the Lords signe and seale of forgiuenes of sinne, unto his people, if it was neyther in Israell nor in Iudah, if it was a false and deceitfull signe in their use, if the ordinances of God reteyned in Iudah & Israell, vvere no better
then the ordinances reteyned among the Heathen? Who is there fearing God, that could indure such false and deceitful consequences: vvhich doe but strengthen the Anabaptists in their errors, and seduce others to like impietie. If they vvould succour themselues by meanes of these clauses inserted, (unto them, in their use of them, &c.) I hauePag. 37, 38. &c. heretofore shevved how these will not help the matter, being duely and rightly considered: vvhich I shall not need here to repeat. Onely remember still, that though mans idolatrie or other sinnes may make Gods sacraments or other constitu∣tions unprofitable unto himself: yet they cannot make them to be lying & deceitfull signes; yea they cannot hinder but that in the Lords ordi∣nance, they are unto al, & therfore also unto them, the Lords true signes and faithfull seales (on his part) of the forgiuenes of sinnes & of eternall life. If men by their owne unbelief and impietie make them unprofitable unto themselues: shall therefore the infidelitie of man turne the trueth of God into a lye? God forbid. And obserue moreover, that if the Sacraments were not stil the Lords signes and seales of remission of sinnes and life eternal: vvofull would be the case of the most godly on the earth, who sinne and transgresse dayly: and vvo vvould it (be in particular) with such as are borne or liue in an idolatrous estate, when they repent and turne again unto the Lord. For vvhat should they now doe, to haue assurance by the Lords seale of the forgiuenes of their sinnes? Should they be circumcised or baptized a new? So in deed vvould the Anabaptists, whom vve haue confuted be∣fore. Or can a false and deceitfull signe, be the Lords true seale of mercy unto them? Or shal the same circumcision and baptisme, which is to day a lying signe and a deceitfull seale unto men (when they are in Idolatrie or other iniquitie) become unto them to morrovv the Lords true signe and seale of grace and eternall life? And if the same men sinne likevvise againe, then it againe become false and execrable? And if they repent againe, then the same againe be the true and holy signe and seale of for∣giuenes of sinnes and life eternall unto them? And so change and alter from time to time, to be the Lords signe to day, and a lye to morrow, to be the Lords seale the next day, and execrable againe the day following; and thus dayly to be turned from a lye to a trueth, and from a trueth to a lye againe, as fraile and sinfull man shall demeane and cary himself? Which vvhat is it els, but also to make mans repentance, faith, and obe∣dience, and not the Lords free grace, promise, & fidelitie, to be grounds and foundation of the Sacraments, &c. And so to bring people to Ana∣baptistry and Arminianisme in the end? Sixtly, it is not unknowne that the terme (dying) is diversly used in the Scriptures: And many both Ievves and Christian writers doe otherwise understand it here, then of being dead in sinne, as by their writings upon this place may appeare. Some vvhereof it will not be amisse to mention, considering vvhat manner of conclusions are builded upon this Scripture
as on the other aforesaid.Jonathae f. Vzz. Chal. paraphr. in Hos. 13, 1. David Kimhi. Aben Ez∣ra. Sal. Jarchi. And first of the Ievv Writers: The Chaldee Paraphrase expounds it thus, When heretofore some of Ephraim spake, fear took hold on the people: they had the dominion in Israell: but after they turned to the worship of idols, they are slaine. Rabbi David Kimhi thus, Ephra∣im lift up his head in Israell: but after he sinned in Baal, he dyed. As if he should say, He was wounded before his enemies, as if he were dead, because his hand [his strength] went away. Aben Ezra thus, He was accounted as dead: and moreover, because Abiah slew all his ormy: Referring it to Ieroboam, who was of Ephraim, as others also doe. Salomon Iarchi thus, After he came up unto greatnes, he sinned in idolatrie: and he dy∣ed: the house of Ieroboam was cut off, and likewise the house of Ahab. As touching the Christian writers, Mercerus expounds it thus, The beginning of idolatrie [in Israell] was the worship of the Calues,Mercerus. brought into Israell out of E∣gypt, where Ieroboam had lived an exile. Hereupon there followed an other evill, the wor∣ship of Baal the Sidonian idoll, brought in by Iezabel (Ahabs wife) 1 King. 16. What calamitie followed hereupon, he shewethHe dyed. in one word: See more in the historie. The family of Ahab was cut off, the land was afflicted with famine, which was accompanied with the plague & for∣reigne enemies, &c. And then againe (applying it to Ieroboam:) After that he sinned by idolatrie (for Baal is often the generall name of an idoll) he dyed, all his dignitie and beauty being lost. The house of Ieroboam, for the calues that he set up, was destroyed, accor∣ding to the word of the Lord by the Prophet. Zanchius thus, As there is a threefold generation: a Bodily, when one is borne being conceived by the seed of man:Zanchius. a Spirituall, when one of being the sonne of Adam is born anew by the boly Ghost, to be the sonne of God: and a Civil, when one from low degree is advanced to some dignitie, or is freed from hard servitude to happie liberty: So there is a threefold death. A Bodily, when the soule is severed from the body: a Spiritual, when a man through sinne is be∣reft of the grace of God, which is the life of the soule: and a Civill, when a man is deprived of his dignitie and power or kingdome or his happy estate. Now by the name of [death] in this place comes properly to be understood the Civill death. And that word [He dyed,] respecteth two things, both the present estate, wherein Israell then was, and their future estate now shortly to come. When therefore he saith, [And he dyed,] shewing the other estate of Israell, such as was at that present, and such as should shortly follow after, he teacheth, that the kingdome of Israel for their idolatrie, both was so far weakned, as it wanted litle of utter ruine, & that short∣ly and certainely it should utterly be destroyed. Calvin thus, After that they sinned in Baal, they dyed, to wit, because God deprived the tribe of Ephraim of that power,Calvin. wherewith before he had adorned it, so as they wanted litle of utter decay. For although their kingdome was not yet fallen, yet was it come euen to the ut∣most, so as the Prophet might well say they were dead, that did now so farre differ from their former estate. But where he saith, [They sinned in Baal,] it is certaine that this was not the be∣ginning of their idolatrie. Ieroboam first made the calues: afterward his successour sett up Baal, and borrowed that superstition from their neighbours the Sidonians, as is thought. English notes.And accordingly the notes of our English Bibles haue it thus, The E∣phraimites are not farre from destruction, and haue lost their authority. Drusius thus, That people is sayd to dye which is utterly wasted and destroyed. Amos 2, 2. [And Moab shall dye vvith tumult.] So in another Prophet,Haba. 1, 12. [Thou art God from ever∣lasting,Drusius. we shall not dye.] Others expound it, he is dead in sinnes: Which I doe lesse approue. I had rather thus take it, [He is dead,] he hath received divers overthrowes and slaughters, he is fallen into grievous calamities, which afterward perpetuall exile followed. And although cor∣rections be instructions: yet when he suffered those so many evils, they did not profit him at all. So thus I say, They could not bring him to life againe. Tremellius and Iunius thus, [He dyed,] That is, he was accounted as dead, being of no account,Tremel. & Junius. Piscator. and of no power or might. And Piscator thus, [He Dyed,] that is, he lost his authoritie, so as he did no more make the subjects to tremble, as before. It is a metaphoricall speach. For as the Greek proverb saith, The dead bites not. Thus haue I set downe particularly the exposition of divers vvriters
upon this place: that so it might the better appear, not onely how these men doe ground their assertions, in so vvaightie matters as these are, up∣on such understanding of the Scripture, as both Ievv vvriters and Chri∣stians (of the best) are otherwise mynded therein: but also, that this Scri∣pture being so understood, as both Iewes & Christians expound it, there can no such opinion or conclusions be gathered from it, as these men would hereby mainteyne: as any may perceiue. And that from their owne exposition, such consequences vvill not follovv, I haue shevved be∣fore. And if neither from their ovvn nor others exposition hereof, what a manner of proof then is this? Which if they will not yet obserue in the case of Israell, let them but consider it in their ovvne, thus as followeth. If one applying this Scripture unto them, should say: N.N. was a teach∣ing Elder, and ruled also in the church, but when he offended by schisme and false doctrine, he dyed: that is, he lost his dignitie and authoritie, be∣ing by the Church put frō the ministration of the Teachers office, which before he executed vvith good regard in the Church: And that the rest of them, are dead vvith him in like sort, according to the place and estate vvhich they had in the church formerly: &c. Or, If some should so apply this Scripture unto them (as they doe to Israel) thus: vvhen they offended by despising and opposing the governors & government of the church, by contention, confusion, & breaking avvay from the church offensiuely, they dyed; and so remayne unto this day, dead in their sinnes: If then ano∣ther (keeping their ovvne vvords) should infer hereupon, that therefore the baptisme and other ordinances of God which they in shevv reteyn, cannot be unto them the signes and seales of forgiuenes of sinnes, and of life eternall: and therefore are in their use of them, false and deceitfull; as be also the ordinances of God (as they call them, that are) reteyned among the beathens: Would they now themselues yeeld, either that the baptisme, and other ordinances of God had among them, are but reteyned in shew; or that they cannot be unto them the signes and seales of forgiuenes of sinnes and of life eternall; or that they are in their use of them false and deceitfull; or that they be but as the or∣dinances reteyned among the heathens? &c. Or if they or their children should repent, and returne to the Lord and his Church againe, would they reject the baptisme they haue, as false and deceitfull; and get them another that might be unto them the signe & seale of forgiuenes of sinnes? Or vvould they still reteyne a false and deceitfull signe, and such as is no better then the baptismes and other ordinances of the Pagans? Or think they that a lying & deceitfull signe, which is no better then the ordinan∣ces of the heathens, can be the Lords true signe & holy seale of forgiue∣nes of sinnes and of life eternall? Or that the Lords signe and seale of forgiuenes of sinnes can be false and decetfull, as be the ordinances of the heathens? Let them consider these things in their heart, & take bet∣ter heed to their vvaies and assertions hereafter. Lastly, to omit other things heretofore observed in this Prophet: if they had but looked eyther to the things here going a litle before, or to
ordinances had among them,See also Jer. 50, 17, 18. &c. was but as the Gentiles? Or doe these men novv judge righter of their estate, then the Prophets did then? Or shall we beleeue them, rather then the Prophets of the Lord? Far be it frō us. If any except, that these things here spoken by Micah, may be applyed, and so are byPiscator, &c. some, to Ierusalem and Iudah: I deny it not: thoughDanaeus, in ver. 16. &c. some also think that they were then applyed to Israell properly. But this hin∣dreth not, but in some respect furthereth the matter against these men: seeing that this Prophet, prophecyingMicah. 1, 1. both against Samaria (in Israel) and Jurusalem (in Iudah:) joyneth them both in like transgressions of idolatrie, oppression, contempt of the word of God taught by the Prophets, loue of false Prophets and their dawbing, &c. Mica. 1, 5, 13. and 2, and 3 chap. and 5, 12, 13, 14. And in this same chapter (vvhereof we speak) mentioneth in particularMic. 6, 16 the kee∣ping of the statutes of Omri, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and walking in their counsels, &c. Novv both Omri and Ahab vvere kings of Israell, and of the worst of them: the one making statutes for maintenance of the ido∣latrie received, and the other bringing in moreover the worship of Baal, (as vvas notedMic. 1, 5, 13. and 5, 12, 13, 14. with 6, 16 here before.) So as whether the things aforesaid be ap∣plyed to Israell, or to Iudah,P. 89, 90 in whom the transgressions of Israell were found: it will come much to a like ende, touching the point in controversie: for eyther or both of them, now still to be the Lords people, to whomMic. 6, 2 — 5. the things aforesaid vvere applyed by the Prophet Micah: and many the like by other of the Prophets also, as by divers instances hath ben shevved before: Pag. 58, &c And thus much touching this objection, and the Scriptures aforesaid here alledged. OBIECTION V. ButM. Aiu. Animadv. p. 81, 82, 91. things are named in Scripture sometime as they haue ben before, though they be not so stil: as1 Sā. 30, 5. Abigail is called the wife of Nabal, though he were then dead, and she maried to David;Mat. 1, 6 Salomon was begotten of Vriahs wife, whereas she was then Davids: so Iesus wasMat. 26, 6. in the house of Simon the Leper, so named because he had ben a Leper. Thus Israell were called Gods people, for that he had ben theirHos. 2, 7. first husband, though in their apostasie they wereHo. 1, 9. & 2, 2. not his people, nor his wife. Se∣condly, they were so called, in respect of their profession, that they would be so esteemed and named, though in deed they were2 Chron. 25, 3. vvithout the true God. As,Mic. 2, 7, 8 O thou that art named the house of Iacob, &c. but he that was yesterday my people, is risen up for an enemy. Third∣ly, they were called Gods people, in respect of their calling againe unto him & his covenant afterward, though for the present they were none of his: AsHos. 2, 18, 19, In that day I vvill marry thee (Israell) unto me for ever,ver. 20. I vvill euen marry thee unto me in faith, and thou shalt knovve the Lord: andver. 23. I vvill haue pittie on her that vvas not pittied
and vvill say to them vvhich vvere not my people, thou art my people, and they shall say, thou art my God. And thus the Gentiles were called Christs Sheep, because they should after be brought in∣to his fold, Ioh. 10, 16. and God had much people in Corinth a heathenish ci∣ty, Act. 18, 10. 1 Cor. 12, 2. and the Iewes to this day are Gods people and beloved, not for their present state which is cursed, but for the promise that they shall hereafter be graffed againe into Christ. Rom. 11.11.20.23.25.26. and 9.4. with Esa. 59, 20.21. Ezech. 34, 23 — 30. Hos. 3.5. ANSWER Will these men still darken counsell by words vvithout knowledge? vvill they never make an end of multiplying their shifts and evasions, er∣rours and false doctrines, abuse of the Word and Scriptures of God, &c. SHIFTS AND EVASIONS. For shifts (besides the other spoken off before) note these also here. 1. That he saith, things are named in Scripture sometime,Shift. as they haue ben before, &c. What then? Are they therefore alwaies so named? Or is it so therefore in the Scriptures, which we alledge about the question in hand? If I again should say, that things are named in Scripture sometime as they are in deed and in trueth, and not onely as they haue ben or shalbe: And, that the Iewes are in the Scripture sometime called the people of God, because they vvere so in deed, being his Church, and under his covenant: vvil he novv therefore graunt that so it is in the places alledged about the point in question? 2. He passeth by,Adver∣tis. p. 59. & answereth not the Scriptures which † I cited here∣about, namely, 2 King. 9, 6. and 13, 23. 2 Chron. 30, 6 — 9. Hos. 4, 6, 12. and 5, 4. and 14, 2. Amos 7, 15. and 8, 2. &c. Which are so very evident against them (besides many otherHere be∣fore p. 59. &c. novv moreover alledged) as if they had but offred to handle them, all vvould soone haue perceived they could finde no an∣swer thereunto. 3. Also in the Scriptures which himself citeth, he passeth by the consi∣deration of that which went before, and vvhich followeth after, yea and sometimes of that which is in the same verse, that he alledgeth: so ma∣king his pretences to haue the more colour:Hos. 1, 9. and 2, 2, 7. Mica. 2, 7, 8, &c. though in the tryall there∣of they proue to haue the lesse substance: as may appeare by that which hath ben, and yet is further to be spoken of his abuse of the Scriptures. And note this the more in his dealing against us: because in other mat∣ters and treatises (vvhere he hath a good cause in hand) he knoweth & useth to deale better and otherwise. 4. He shuffles together the times and estates of Israell, spoken off by the Prophets: some things being spoken of them, when they vvere yet in the land of promise, some when they were cast out of the land, and made wanderers among the nations; betvveen which, there is great difference; as I haue shevved here before. Neyther doeth he onely confound the
times, but darken the true and right meaning of the Scriptures, vvhat he can: of vvhich more hereafter, although ynough haue ben shewed be∣fore hereabout, to such as are wise of heart. ERROVRS. For errors and false doctrines, note here againe that still he saith, and vvould perswade it (if he could) that Israell in their apostasie was not the Lords people. If so, what vvill he then say of Iudah, in their apostasie? Were not they Gods people neyther? The Prophets oftenMic. 1, 1, 5, 13. 2 Chr. 28, 2. joyne them together, & shew, that the transgressions of Israel were found in Judah: yea thatEzec. 16, and 23. Iudah vvas vvorse then Israell in her abominations, & justified Samaria and Sodome, in respect of her self. But of this sufficient hath ben spoken before. And vvhat vvil he say to the churches of Asia, which he also saith wereAnim∣ad. p. 103. apo∣state in Iohns time? vvere not they neyther in their apostasie the people of the Lord? And this is the more to be observed, because he himself would haue us to apply our reasons that are taken from Israel to those times & churches in Iohns dayes: as I noted here before. His words are these,Ibid. Thus their reasons from Israell are also impertinent to the (present) estate of the church of Rome: they mightNote this well. well serue for the times wherein John livedRevel. 2, & 3 chap. when the true churches were many of them apostate. So then he thinketh that apostate Israell, and these churches may be compared together. Novv the Scri∣pture calleth these churchesRev. 1, 12. & 2, 1. golden Candlesticks, in the midst vvherof Christ wal∣keth: and himself cals these true Churches, which he saith also were apostate: and vvould haue us to apply our Reasons from Israell, unto them. Hovv is it then that when he opposeth us about Israell, he tels us, that Israell in their apostasie was not the Church or people of God, nor under his covenant, but divorced from the Lord; and that the circumcision had among them, was not the true signe and seale of Gods covenant, but in their use a false and deceitfull signe unto them; as was also the ordinances (as he calles them) of God reteyned among the Gentiles, &c. Will he also say thus of the churches of Asia, in Iohns time? Or would he haue us to apply these things vvhich he speaketh of Israell unto them? Far be it from us. It is much better for us and all other to obserue these errors and contradictions of his, which are novv so usuall vvith him, in his erro∣neous pleas & assertions into vvhich he is fallen. Whereof I haue spoken also before. Moreover the Prophets teach us, that these Phrases,Zach. 2, 11. to be joyned to the Lord, and, to be the people of the Lord, are both alike, and come to a like end. And the many reasons and ScripturesPag. 58, &. &c. before alledged, shevving that Israell in apostasie was yet by the Prophets acknowledged to be the Lords people and under his covenant, are here still to be remembred: though I doe not again repeat them. 2. And so here is to be noted another notable errour & false doctrine, viz. that if the opinion vvhich here (and throughout his treatise) he tea∣cheth, and vvould father upon the Prophets, were true, then should the Prophets contradict themselues & the other Scriptures: inasmuch as by his doctrine they should teach, that Israell whiles they were in the land, being in apostasie, were not the Lords people, nor under his covenāt, nor the Lord their God, &c.
vvhereas they teach the contrary directly, as I haue already shewed by many reasons and particulars out of their vvritings undeniably: vvhich vvere long to rehearse: and whereunto many other might be annexed. Novv onely let it suffice to note these briefly: viz. that they intitle and stile the Lord thus, The Lord God of Israel: & this also in cases cōcerning Is∣rael, vvhen they vvere in apostasie: as when Eliah said unto Ahab,1 Kin. 17 1. As the Lord God of Israell liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be devve, &c. And again in the same chapter, to the vvidovv of Sarepta,ver. 14. Thus saith the Lord God of Israell, the barrell of meale shall not wast, &c. And when the Prophet af∣tervvard said unto Iehu,2 Kin. 9.6. Thus saith the Lord God of Israell, I haue annointed thee king over the people of the Lord, euen over Israell. And the like again, 2 King. 14, 25. and many times both in the historie; and in the Prophets, both be∣fore that time and after. For which see 1 King. 16, 13, 33. and 22, 53. 2 King. 10, 31. Hos. 4, 6. and 12, 6, 9, 14. and 14, 1. Amos 4, 12. Mic. 6, 2 — 8, 16. and in di∣vers other places. The like may be observed, in that they acknowledge the Lord, to be God in Israell, and that there is no other God in all the earth besides him: As vvhen Eliah in Ahabs time said unto God in his prayer,1 Kin. 18 36. Lord God of Abraham Isaac, and Israell, Let it be known this day that thou art God in Israell, and that I am thy servant, &c. And when Naaman the Syrian being healed by Elisha the Prophet acknowledged, saying,2 Kin. 5, 15. Behold, now I know that there is no God in al the earth, but in Israel. And the like in Eliahs reproof of Ahaziah, vvhen2 Kin. 1, 3, 6, 16. he sent to Baalzebub the God of Ekron, as if there were not a God in Israel. Which also the very names that they gaue their children may import, as2 King. 10, 35. Iehoahaz, si∣gnifying Iehovahs possession, or the Lord taking hold;2 King. 14, 29. Zechariah, myndful of Iah, or remembring the Lord: and the like. Yea, Achabs children were called1 King. 22.40. A∣chaziah, possessing Jah, or taking hold on the Lord: &2 King. 3.1. Iehoram, Iehovah is high, &c. Also, that the Prophets took this for a ground of their doctrines, ex∣hortations, promises and reproofs, that the Lord was their God, from the time of their comming out of the land of Egypt, unto the dayes of Ho∣seah, Micah, Amos, &c. Hos 12, 9. and 13, 4. Amo. 3, 1, 2. Mic. 6, 2 — 8. &c. And that the Prophets reproved them for not observing the Lavv of God, the New moones, and Sabbaths, &c. Hos. 4, 6. and 8, 12. Amo. 8, 2, 5. And for making covenants and mariages vvith the people of other nations, rely∣ing upon them, and not on the Lord in their troubles, &c. Ezec. 23, 2, 5, 6. with ver. 11, 12, 13. Hos. 5, 7, 13. and 7, 8, 11. That when the Lord (being angry with Israell) had delivered them into the hands of the kings of Syria, Ie∣hoahaz the king of Israell besought Iehovah the Lord; and the Lord heark∣ned unto him: seeing the oppression of Israell, because the king of Syria oppressed them. 2 King. 13, 3, 4. And againe, that the Lord was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and respect unto them, because of his covenant vvith Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and vvould not destroy them neyther cast them from his presence as yet. 2 King. 13, 23. Finally, that the land of Canaan was a pledge of Gods promise and covenant unto them, so long as he suffred them to remayne therein. Hos. 9, 3, 15, 17. Amos 7, 17.
vvith Gen. 17, 7, 8. And sundry other the like things (more largely treated offPag. 58, &c. before) which necessarily evince that they vvere yet stil the Lords peo∣ple, and under his covenant, and in farre other estate, then the Gentiles and na∣tions of the vvorld: And that the doctrine therefore of this man is nota∣bly erroneous, & such as would make the Prophets to contradict them∣selues, if we should beleeue him. Which God forbid. Yea, let the Pro∣phets still be teachers of truth (as vve are sure they are) and let this man rather be a Teacher of falsehood herein, as he hath ben found in some other matters besides. Neyther doth he onely contradict the Prophets, but himself also & his ovvn doctrine heretofore, if I be not mistaken in the observation there∣of, vvhen (in myne owne hearing) treating upon the books of the kings, and particularly upon that vvhich is vvritten, 2 Kin. 9, 6. where the Pro∣phet said to Iehu, Thus saith the Lord God of Israell, I haue annointed thee king over the people of the Lord, euen over Israel: he taught thereupon to this effect as follovveth:These ob∣servations about this matter, I haue noted downe. That Israell in defection, is here called the Lords people: 1. In com∣parison of other nations, vvho vvere uncircumcised. 2. In respect of the Lords mercy, vvho kept his covenant on his part, though they had broken it on theirs. The Lord had not yet giuen thē a bil of divorcement. 3. For that the Lord had yet many of his people among them (1 King 19, 18. and 18, 4. 2. King. 2, 1, 3, 5, 7. and 4, 1, 8, 9, 10, 42.) 4. For that they acknovvledged and professed to serue the true God, Iehovah, though they did it after a corrupt manner: and because they kept still divers of his ordinances, as circum∣cision, &c. so as they vvere upon repentance admitted to the Passeover, vvithout a nevv circumcision. 2 Chro. 30 chap. Yet notvvithstanding, none might joyne vvith Israell in that estate of apostasie, but vvere to depart frō them, & plead with them, &c. Hos. 2, 2. and 4, 15. Amo. 5, 4, 5. As now also, touching the Church of Rome, &c. Rev. 18, 4. This doctrine I wish may be vvell observed both of himself, and of all others, and especially of his hearers then, and followers now: as being alone sufficient both to convinceM. Ain, Animdad. p. 67-107. his treatise now published, of notable errour and false doctrine; and on the other hand to manifest the truth in a good measure. And of him yet more particularly I desire, that he would seriously weigh vvith himself (as before the Lord) vvhether he did not then teach to this effect; and so to consider, vvhether now he be not con∣trary to himself, and contradicting the trueth of his former doctrine: as also hovv ready he hath ben, euē in cases of religion, to yeeld to the plea∣sure of men (for what cause, or of what infirmitie, himself best knoweth:) And that therefore he vvould be carefull to consider his vvaies in his heart; and to leaue his halting courses, and his schismaticall walking; & to set himself to make straight steps to his feet, least that which is lame be turned out of the vvay: Which should rather be healed; that so the good gifts which God hath giuen him, may hereafter be imployed to the churches good, with lesse scandall and hinderance of the truth, then hath benheretofore. 3. Other errors also may be noted here: which are again to be obser∣ved, when we come to speak of the Scriptures vvhich here he alledgeth.
As namely, that he maketh the estate of Israell, vvhiles they were in the land of promise, and under the covenant of God which he made vvith Abra∣ham, Isaac, and Jacob (as I haue shevved out of 2 King. 13, 23. Hos. 9, 3. and sundry other places:) to be like the Gentiles, vvhiles they were straungers frō the covenants of promise, being yet uncalled, and not brought into the Lords fold. Ephes. 2, 11, 12. with Joh. 10, 16. 4. And that he would make Israels estate, whiles they were in the land of Canaan, and before Christs comming in the flesh: to be like the Iewes present estate, when now they are scattered abroad over the vvorld, & cast away by the Lord, having refused Christ exhibited, &c. 2 King. 13, 23. Hos. 9, 3, 12, 17. Rom. 11, 15. 1 Thes. 2, 15, 16. Heb. 1, 1, 2. Of which more hereafter. ABVSE AND VAIN ALLEGATION OF SCRI∣ptures. And first towching 1 Sam. 30, 5. Mat. 1, 6. and 26, 6.Abuse of Scriptures. Now next for his perverting and abusing of the Scriptures (vvhich is common with him throughoutM. A. Animad. the vvhole book, novv spoken off) al∣though ynough haue ben noted about it before, yet it shall not be amisse briefly here againe to obserue a few things more thereabout. The first1 Sam. 30, 5. Mat. 1, 6. & 26, 6. three Scriptures (vvhich speak of Abigail the wife of Nabal, of Vriahs wife, now being Davids, and of Simon the Leper) might be omitted, as being idly al∣ledged, to shew that which no man denyeth, viz. that things are named in Scripture sometime as they haue been before, though they be not so still. Of vvhich point I haue spoken in hisPag. 97. Shifts here before. Onely now seeing he spea∣keth of these here, let it be observed, vvhether on the one hand he him∣self deale not unthankfully, and sinfully with the people of God, as Nabal did vvith David, and David vvith Vriah: and on an other hand whether his ovvn estate be not unlike his third instance of Simon the Lepers, who being once cleansed from it, did so remayne, whereas himself having fal∣len into schisme, by his own acknowledgment and being once returned from it, straightvvay ran into that estate again, and so continueth unto this day. Touching Hos. 2.7. Novv for the Scriptures vvhich concerne the point in hand:Hos. 2.7. the first is, Hos. 2, 7. vvhich himself (upon better consideration) will not deny, but it speaketh of the time of Israels rejection and exile, vvhen they should be out of the land, and of the fruit & effect thereof, for working in them repentance, to returne to the Lord their first husband, vvhose true wor∣ship they had left, to follovv Idols, and from vvhich idolatrie they would not be drawne by any admonition, forbearance, or correction, till the Lord cast them off and droue them out of his land (as by thatChap. 1, & 3, &c. compared with ch. 2. vvhich goeth before, & follovveth after in this prophecy, may appeare:) where∣as our question is of their estate, whiles yet they vvere in the land, and vvhiles for their apostasie the Lord vvas still admonishing them, & with long forbearance correcting and punishing them sundry vvayes from time to time. And so this Scripture is not unto the point of the question
in hand. Yet notvvithstanding by this occasion note novv also the Chal∣dee paraprase hereupon, vvhich expounds it thus,Chald. paraphr. in Hos. 2. Therefore, behold, I will break off thy way, as if some should hedge (it) up with thornes, and I will shut it up, as if some should shut it up with a wall, that she shall not find her paths. She shall in deed follow af∣ter peace with the peoples, that they may be her friends, but she shall not obteyn them: and she shall seek help, but she shall not find it: then shall she say with her self, I will goe and returne to the worship of my former Lord: For it was better with me when I worshipped him, then now. I will not worship idols hereafter. Where it may be observed, how this pa∣raphrase expounds, the forsaking or returning to the Lord, of forsaking or returning to the true warship of God. Which is also usuall throughout that para∣phrase. The observation vvhereof, vvil giue great light to the understan∣ding of many Scriptures, and clearing of sundry questions. And these things, this man himself knoweth very wel: & can giue light from thence othervvhere, in such places and matters, vvhere his own errors and opi∣nions are not convinced thereby: as his otherM. Ain. Annot. on Gen. Exod. Psal. &c. better writings sufficient∣ly manifest. Touching Hos. 1.9. The next Scripture is Hos. 1, 9. vvhich being duely observed, will also proue to be against himself.Hos. 1.9. Whereabout I must repeat some things no∣ted herePag. 77, &c. before. For touching this matter it is still to be remembred, that this prophet prophecyed in the dayes of Ieroboam the sonne of Io∣ash, Iehues great grandchild: (vvho was the thirteenth king of Israel frō Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat that caused Israell to sinne.) Now all that time he foreshewed, how Gomer (vvhich is Israell) should bring forth three children; the first, the Prophet should cal,Hos. 1, 4. Jezreel, noting the taking away of the kingdome of Israell from the house of Iehu, for the blood shed by him in the valley of Iezreell. The accomplishment vvhereof came afterward to passe in the daies of Zachariah (vvho vvas of Iehues posteritie, and the fourth king after him) as was now foretold in his fa∣thers dayes. For vvhich see 2 King. 15, 8, 9. 10. &c. The second child, the Prophet should call,Hos. 1, 6. Lo-ruhamah, not obteyning mercy; noting the calami∣tie, that should yet further come upon Israell, vvhen they not obteyning mercy, should be delivered into the hands of Tiglath-Pileser king of As∣syria, and a great part of them be caried away captiue: as came to passe aftervvard in the dayes of Pekah (the eightenth king of Israell from Ie∣roboam the first) 2 King. 15, 27, 28, 29. and 1 Chron. 5, 25, 26. The third child, the Prophet should call,Hos. 1, 9. Lo-ammi, not my people: noting yet farre greater miserie vvhich should come upon Israell, vvhen they should be cast out of the Lords land, and wander among the nations, as other people: who had before ben the Lords people, and he their God, that had hitherto kept them in his land, as his people in his ovvn house and presence: but now would cast them off and scatter them among the Gentiles. As came to passe, in the dayes off Hoseah the last king of Israell, about two hundred and fourty yeares, from Israels falling into apostasie, when they sined & divided themselues from Iudah, in the dayes of Ieroboam the
sonne of Nebat that caused Israell to sinne. 2 King. 17, 1 — 6. &c. And soHos. 1, 9. this Scripture also is not to the point in hand: our question being con∣cerning the estate of Israel, whiles yet they were in the land, all the yeres and kings dayes aforesaid, untill the child,Not my people. Lo-ammi (now spoken off) was borne, and they came to the estate signified by this name, not to be the people of the Lord, nor to haue him to be their God, to defend, help, and deliver them, as formerly he had done. Whereabout I haue treated more largelyP. 78, &c before: and needed not now again to haue handled this matter (though thus briefly:) but that here he alledgeth this Scripture in particu∣lar, and shuffleth together the divers times and estates of Israell: vvhich are carefully to be distinguished for the right understanding of the Scri∣ptures, and better fynding out of the trueth in the things aforesaid. And here again it shall not be amisse, to note, hovv the Chaldee para∣phrase expoundeth & speaketh of these things, as followeth.Jonathae Chald. pae∣raphr. in Hose. 1, 2 — 9. The Lord said unto Hoseah, Goe declare a prophecy against the inhabitants of the city giuen to adulterie, which heap sinnes upon sinnes. For nowNote this. a long time haue the inhabitants of this city goe a whoring, forsakingN. B. the worship of the Lord. 3. He went therefore and prophecied against them, that if they did returne, they should be forgiuen: but if not, that as the leaues of the figge tree, fade, so they should fade away. But they committed evil deeds more excedingly. 4. There∣fore the Lord said unto him, Giue them this name, [Dispersed.] For after a litle while, I will shew, that I remember the blood of the idolaters, which Iehu shed in Iezreell, who in deed flewe them, because they were worshippers of Baal, but Iehu himself & his children again went astray after the calues of Bethell. Wherefore I will impute that blood, as innocent blood, unto the po∣steritie of Iehu, and will tae away the kingdome from the familie of Israell. 5. At that time also will I break the strength of the warriours of Israell in the valley of Iezreel. 6. But they did evill works more and more. Then the Lord said unto him, Giue them this name, that [they are not beloved,] because of their works: For I wil not be brought hereafter, again to loue the chil∣dren of Israell. Yet if they repent, I will surely forgiue them. 7. And I will loue the family of Iudah, and will deliver them by the word of the Lord their God: But they shall not be delivered by bow or sword, or men of warre, horses or horsemen. 8. But their children,N B▪ after they were caried away captiue into exile, were found among the peoples not to be deare unto God because of their works: yet they added mo unto their former evill deeds. 9. Therefore (the Lord said to Hoseah, Giue them this name, [Not my people.] For you are not my people: Seeing you obserue not the words of my law, my word shall not be your help. Where we may obserue these things: 1. That this prophecy was giuen, whē they had already a long time gone a whoring from God, forsaking the worship of the Lord. 2. That the Pa∣raphrast expoundeth their departing frō the Lord to be the forsaking of his worship: as they also expound their returning to their first husband spokē of ch. 2, 7.) to be the returning to the worship of their first Lord. 3. That these things now denoun∣ced, vvere to come upon them yet aftervvard. 4. And that also by de∣grees, and in succession of time, one after another. 5. And the last, of not being his people, referred to the time,Which others re∣fer to the time, when they were first put out of the lād, in king Hoseah dayes. after they were caried away captiue into exile: when there also they added mo iniquities to their former evil deeds. Whereas our controversie is, about the estate of Israel for the time of their apostasie, vvhile they were in the land, when Ieroboam had set up the calues, untill they were cast out: as is aforesaid. And thus much now again, of this Scripture, in Hos. 1, 9. Touching Hos. 2.2. Then follovveth Hos. 2, 2. Of which I haue spoken here before: p. 77, &c.
Now onely I annex this withall.Hos 4, 1. Mic. 6, 2. with Ezec. 20, 4 — 36. and 22, 2. and 23, 36 &c. First, that seeing here it is said, Plead with your Mother, Plead, &c. this may lead us to consider, that the Lord now was yet stil admonishing them, and pleading with them: as he had done before sundry times and vvayes, like as with Iudah also: and as sinners by the Lords ordinance) are to be dealt vvith, afore they be proceeded against. All knovv, that in ordinary course of proceeding in all churches vvell ordered, such as fall into sinne (though but particular persons) are notwithstanding still esteemed of the church, untill such time as despising the meanes used, & being found obstinate, they be cast out of the church & house of God. Hovv much more vvould the Lord haue this observed, towards an vvhole church, yea towards so many tribes, cityes, and syna∣gogues, as perteyned to Israel, the mother here spoken off? And vvhat then shall vve conclude hereupon, tovvching the point in question? Secondly,Mercerus. Drusius, &c. n Hos. 2, 2. some understand it of the rejection of the Jewes, when they had refused Christ exhibited in the flesh: thinking that this sermon of the Prophets vvas needfull for the comforting of the beleevers at that time, least they also should forsake Christ, being affected with the offence and stumbling of the multitude of the Iewes, that so refused him. AndCalvin, Zanchius, &c. in Hos. 2, 2. others under∣standing it of the tenne tribes, expound it thus: Plead with your mother, plead: He speaketh here in the person of God. Now God useth the similitude of marriage. So let us see what is the summe of the words. If an husband make a divorce with his wife, he bringeth some note of ignominie upon their children, which are borne of that mariage. Their mother is put a∣way, therefore the children are lesse esteemed because of the divorce. If the husband of froward∣nesse put away his wife from him, the children justly hate him. What? He loved not our mother as he ought: he kept not the sayth and bond of mariage. This therefore is usuall, that the chil∣drens mynds are alienated from the Father, if he deale with the mother inhumanely, or els alto∣gether contumeliously. Thus the Israelites, when they savv that they vvere rejected, vvould lay the blame upon God. For the people here is called the [Mother:] that is, the name of the mother is transferred to the body of the people, or to the stock of Abraham. God had espoused that people to himself, and vvould haue them to be as his vvife. Seeing therefore God vvas the hus∣band of the people, the Israelites vvere as the children begotten of that mariage. Novv after the divorce, the Israelites said, that God vvas cruell, because he had cast them avvay vvithout their fault. The Prophet novv therefore undertakes the defence of Gods cause: and yet speaks in his person, Plead [saith he] plead vvith your mother. Finally this place agreeth vvith Esa. 50. There it is said in the beginning of the chapter, Where is the bill of divorce? Haue I sould you to my Creditors? But you are sold for your sinnes, and your mother is put avvay for her iniquity. &c. And this all know was spoken by Esay to Iudah, or the Iewes generally. Zanchius also writing on Hos. 2, 2. noteth this in like sort for the argu∣ment & summe of this matter. The Prophet (saith he) teacheth, that there vvas no cause vvhy the Israelites should expostulate vvith God, that he in putting avvay their mother the Synagogue, did note each of them also vvith this marke of infamie, that they vvere borne of fornication. For the vvhole cause of this evill and infamie, vvas to be ascribed to their mother, to vvit, their open and continuall fornication, joyned together vvith untollerable un∣thankfulnes tovvards God. &c. Thus both the one and the other apply it to the rejection of Israell though the one refer it to the time afore Christ, the other to the time af∣ter. And then it toucheth not the question in hand. Touching 2 Chron. 15, 3. The next Scripture here cited, is 2 Chron, 15, 3. Of vvhich also I haue
spoken here before: pag. 65, &c. To which I refer the Reader:2 Chron. 15, 3. wishing this vvithall to be observed & remembred, hovv the Chaldee Paraphrase and other vvriters expound such places & phrases of speach of the follow∣ing of idols, and leaving the true and right worship of God. A sinne, not peculiar onely to Israell, but often found also in Iudah, and in all the tribes toge∣ther: as I haue shevved before. Touching whom I suppose they wil make no such conclusions thereupon, as here they do of Israell. Touching Mica. 2, 7, 8. Novv next followeth, that vvhich is vvritten, Micah. 2, 7, 8.Mic. 2, 7, 8. vvhich may be understood eyther generally of the whole people of Israell, that is, both of the ten tribes, and of Iudah; or of eyther of them severally: and every way maketh against these men themselues. For if it be understood of all the tribes and people generally: then it maketh not more against the ten tribes, then it doth also against Iudah; which themselues acknow∣ledge vvere at this time the people and church of God, and under his co∣venant. That it may be understood of them both joyntly, these reasons may induce: 1. That this Prophet denounceth judgement in this prophecy to both of them (both upon Iudah & Israel) for their sinnes: as the title and processe of his book shevveth. The title, vvhich is this,Mic. 1, 1. † The word of the Lord that came to Micah, in the dayes of Iotham, Ahaz, & Hezekiah kings of Iu∣dah, which he saw concerning Samaria (the chief city of Israell) and Ierusalem (the chief city of Iudah) Mic. 1, 1. The processe, in the course of his procee∣ding, and often joyning them together: for vvhich see these and the like places, vvhich vvould be long here to write downe, Mic. 1, 5, 6, 9, 13. and 2, 4, 5, 12. and 3, 1, 9, 10, 11, 12. and 6, 2, 3, 4. &c. 2. That in this chapter, he spea∣keth of that family, and expressely useth the terme of a family: ver. 3. compared with Amos 3, 1. and Mica. 6, 2, 3, 4. and the phrase, of casting a cord by lot in the Congregation of the Lord. Which may haue reference to the auncient di∣viding of the land by lot among all the tribes, in Iosuahs time. Mic. 2, 5. compared with Ios. 14, 1. and 15, 1. &c. Deut. 32, 9. As also the generall termes both of the house of Jacob, Mic. 2, 7. being compared vvith Mic. 1, 1. & 3, 1, 8. and 6, 2, 3, 4. and Amos 3, 1, 13. Luke 1, 33. and of the people of God: Mica. 2.8, 9. and 3.1, 3, 5. and 6, 2, 3. &c. 3. That the things going before & follovving in the chapter alledged, may be applied to all the tribes (both Israell and Iudah:) viz. the sinnes of oppressing the poore, & of approving such pro∣phets as taught according to the peoples lust, and liking, Mic. 2, 1 — 11. and the punishment of exile and departure out of the land denounced there∣upon, Mic. 2, 10, &c. Not to speak hovv Tremellius & Iunius joyne all the first fiue chapters of this prophecy together, as making but one ser∣mon, directed to Iudah and Israel, & denouncing the overthrow of both the kingdomes, because of their sinnes. And so then their reasoning from hence, is aswell against Iudah as against Israell. Or if it be understood of the ten tribes of Israell more particularly (as
here they apply it; and so may it be:) then also consider, vvhether the same people be not in the same chapter a litle before called the congregati∣on of the Lord: And that not onely in their owne perswasion and profession, but in the Lords and the Prophets account. Mic. 2, 5. Which speach is the more to be mynded, being such as would soone end this controversie, if they be acknovvledged now at this time, to haue ben the Church of the Lord: it being at least about tvvo hundred yeeres after Ieroboam had set up the calues, and so long after Israels apostasie here spoken off. For if they graunt them to be the church of the Lord, I suppose they will not denye them to be the people of the Lord, or his vvife; neyther vvill affirme hereafter, that the circumcision and other ordinances of God reteyned among them, were in their use false, deceitfull, and execrable signes and seales, and no better then the ordinances reteyned among the Heathens. They vvill (I hope) be better advised, then thus to speak of the Lords ordinances, had and reteyned in the Lords Church; & vvill now at length learn to put difference between the Lords ordinances themselues, and his peoples abuse or corruptions thereabout; also betvveen the Lords church and ordinances, and the Pa∣gans assemblies and abominations; yea and betweene the Lords church sometimes walking in syncerity, and the same church of the Lord com∣ing to be corrupted vvith idolatrie or other transgressions, and so fallen into apostasie, as Israell novv was, and Iudah also sometime. Esa. 1, 21. Secondly, the phrase of being named, called, or said to be, is sometimes al∣so put for that vvhich in deed is, or may be so accounted: as in Esa. 44, 5. Ier. 23, 6. and 33, 16. Joh. 13, 13. and the like places. And so the Chaldee pa∣raphrase here expounds it: Yet so I will not here urge it. But taking it, that Israell was here called the house of Jacob, and the people of God in respect of their owne profession, that would be so esteemed: yet this doeth not hinder, but that also they vvere so in deed, albeit they did not vvalk accordingly, as they ought to haue done. For if vve understand it thus, O thou that art na∣med the house of Jacob, that is, O thou that gloryest that thou art descended of Jacob, and yet doest not walk in his steps: will it therefore follow, that they vvere not in deed descended of him, or vvere not the house of Iacob, &c. See it in another case. Esay the Prophet speaking of Iudah, saith:Esa. 48, 1, 2. Heare ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called (or, call themselues) by the name of Israell, and are come forth out of the waters of Iudah, vvhich svveare by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israell, but not in trueth nor in righteousnes: For they call themselues of the holy city, and stay themselues (that is, professe that they stay) up∣on the God of Israell, &c. Was not Iudah now therefore the house of Iacob, nor come out of the waters of Iudah? Or were they not therefore the Lords people, nor his wife: because of this hypocriticall profession of theirs? Or vvere they in deed without the true God, as he understandeth and speak∣eth it here concerning Israell? And note, that Esay here hath the same terme of the house of God, that Micah hath in the other place. Againe, the Iewes in Christs time, said,Mat. 3, 9. Joh. 8, 39. they had Abraham to their Father: and herein they gloryed: but they did not the vvorks of Abraham, as Christ told
them. Yet Christ acknowledgeth themJoh. 8, 37. to be Abrahams seed, though they sought to kill him, which Abraham did not: and so vvere not in this re∣spectIoh. 8, 39 40, 44. the children of Abraham, but of the divel: andMatt. 3, 7.9. a generation of vipers, as Iohn Baptist also called them: and yet never denyed, that Abraham vvas their father; and they the church of God now also at this time. So both these may stand together: that a people may glory in this, that they are the house of Iacob, the people of Israell, the seed of Abraham, the church of God, &c. and be so also indeed: and yet not walk as they ought, according to that estate, whereof they doe so glory and boast themselues. For who know∣eth not that many doe often boast vainly of those things, which yet they haue truely: but vvalk not vvorthy of them as they should? Many in Iu∣dahZeph. 3.11. were haughty, because of the Lords holy mountaine. Had they it not there∣fore in deed among them? Though yet they did not walk worthy there∣of: For vvhich they were punished. Zeph. 1, & 3 chap. And many the like still are found in other churches from time to time: vvho notvvithstan∣ding are to be accounted the people of God, and members of the chur∣ches of God, vvhiles they so remayne: though yet they walk unvvorthy of that estate and favour of God. For vvhich also see Mal. 1, 6, 7, 8, &c. Thirdly, if it vvere true (as this man here pleadeth) that Israell novv vvas not Gods people, but onely so called in respect of their owne profession, that they vvould be so esteemed and named: then should the mayne force of the Pro∣phets reproof be weakned, and the finne both of the people and gover∣nours of Israell be far lesse, and of another sort and nature, then it was in deed and in truth. As namely, vvhen the Lord speaking by the Prophet, saith.Mic. 2, 8. Euen of late (or, yesterday) my people is risen up as an enemie. And in the next verse,ver. 9. The women of my people haue ye cast out from their pleasant houses. And in the next chapter,Mic. 3, 1 2, 3. Heare, I pray you, O heads of Iacob, and ye princes of the house of Israell: is it not for you to know judgment? vvho hate the good and loue the evill; who also eat the flesh of my people, &c. And againe,ver. 5. Thus saith the Lord concerning the Prophetsor, that deceiue my people. that make my people erre, that bite vvith their teeth and cry, Peace, &c. In vvhich places and the like any may perceiue, that both the Lords reproofs, and Israels sinnes are the greater, because they were the Lords people, that did these things, & unto vvhom they vvere done. Where upon one vvriting hereabout, observeth and urgeth it, as a point of spe∣ciall waight, in this sort:Calvin in Mic. 3, 5. vvith v. 1, & 3. The indignitie is increased, seeing this injurie is done to the people of God. If the Assyrians or Ethiopians, or Egyptians, had ben spoyled of their princes, this had ben more tollerable: but whenas the people of God it self is so cruelly devoured, this is lesse sufferable. So where the people of God is deceived, and the trueth is turned into a lye, this sacriledge is more detestable. This therefore is the reason vvhy he saith, [They which deceiue my people:] This people is holy unto me: for I haue chosen them to my self: when therefore it is corrupted with fraud and deceit, is not euen myne own majestie after a sort violated? is not my soverainty diminished? Now therefore we perceiue, why the Prophet saith, [They deceiue my people.] In deed it is sure that the Iewes were worthy to be so deceived,Deut. 13. as God also other∣where saith, that he maketh tryall, what the people is, whensoever he suffereth false prophets a∣mong them. This therefore was a just recompense, that then Sathan had liberty giuen, to pervert sound doctrine among the people. And none is ever deceived, but willingly and of their owne accord. Although many seem to be drawen to destruction through their owne simplicity, yet alvvayes there is some hypocrisy withall. But this doth not lessen the fault in the false teachers
if the people deserue such punishment: Therefore the Prophet doth nevertheles proceed in his reproof, and saith that this was [the people of God.] How? truly by adoption. Although the Iewes therfore caried themselues unworthy of so great honour, yet God accounteth them among his people, that he may punish in false teachers the wickednes, which now he accuseth in them. Hitherto M. Calvin, in his Commentarie on Mic. 3, 5. Novv how contrary doctrine, and hovv false, the Teacher (with vvhom we haue to deale,) publisheth hereabout: I wish both himself and his follovvers well to ob∣serue, vvith the consequences thereof. And vvhat if another or himself would except in like sort touching Iudah (as he doeth touching Israell) vvhen we alledge the like concerning them out of Ieremie the Prophet, vvhere speaking of the Priests and Prophets false dealing, he sayth,Ier. 6, 14. & 8, 11. They haue healed the hurt of the daughter of my people sleightly, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace. If novv another should say, that Iudah was called the people of God, in respect of their profession, that they would be so estee∣med and named, though in deed they were not so: and vvould also plead it the more, because they had nowNot re∣lying upon him, and worshiping him, accor∣ding to his word. forsaken the true God,Ier. 2, 13 with v. 2. the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisternes, broken cisternes that could hold no water: and so inferre that neyther Israell nor Iudah vvas now the people of God: Where then may we think, vvas the Church of God in those dayes, and where was the Lords ordinance of circumcision to be had? Hovv great∣ly also should they by this meanes weaken the Prophets reproofs, & les∣sen the sinnes of that people: if they vvere not in deed the people of God, as hath ben sayd? Fourthly, according to their assertion, they might also tell us, that those whom Micah in the next chapter callethMic, 3, 1, 9. the heads of Jacob, and the princes of the house of Israell, vvere not so in deed, but onely in their owne perswa∣sion and profession: and thus might pervert any termes and phrases of the Scripture, at their pleasure. They might haue observed also touching one of the verses here al∣ledged, how the nevv Translation in our toungue hath it thus, Euen of late my people is risen up as an enemie: and hovv it followeth presently in the next verse, The women of my people haue ye cast out from their pleasant houses, &c. The observation vvherof might haue dravven them to a further consideration hereabout: Specially being compared with the use of the same terme, in the other places mentioned, Mic. 3, 1, 3, 5. and in 6, 2, 3, &c. But his vvoon∣ted passing over of some places, and perverting of other, not regarding what goeth before or follovveth after, and so laying some words toge∣ther, as may seem best to serue his turne, and using any pretences he can for the more colour thereabout: these things I leaue to be considered by the judicious readers, that are able and carefull to obserue them. And novv onely for a conclusion of this point, I vvill note here the ex∣position of the Chaldee paraphrase,Chal. pa∣raphr. in Mic. 2, 7, 8. in the verses here cited by himself: which (after the interpretation of the sixt verse, thus: Prophecy not at all, neyther teach this people: seeing they endure not to be bovved) expoundeth the 7 and 8 verses after this maner, Is it thus right, say the children (or, posterity) of Jacob? Should the word of the Lord be made voyd? Are these his works? Are not al
my sayings right? that which I said should come to passe, haue I brought it to passe on them that vvalk aright. 8. My people for their sinnes is delivered unto the adversarie: the nations stand up against them, &c. And hitherto of the application hereof unto Israell. Now if this Scripture be understood of Iudah, then the inferences that he bringeth from hence upon Israell, vvill fal upon Iudah. Which yet him∣self acknovvledgeth vvas novv the church and people of God. And that it may thus be understood & applyed to Iudah, these reasons may shew. 1. TheMic. 1, 1. title of the prophecy, directeth it as vvell to Ierusalem (of Iudah) as to Samaria, of Israell. 2. Divers particular speaches in the prophecy it self: as when he saith in the first chapter,Mic. 1, 5. What are the high places of Judah, are they not Ierusalem? Again,ver. 9. Her wound is incurable, for it is come unto Judah: he is come unto the gate of my people, euen to Ierusalem. And again,ver. 13. O thou inhabitant of Lachish (a city of Iudah) bynd the charet to the swift beast: shee is the beginning of the sinne to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israell were found in thee. And in the se∣cond chapter, & the verses here alledged, the general termesCha. 2, 3. 5, 7, 8, 9. of the house of Jacob, and the people of the Lord, &c. And that these & the like termes are in the Scriptures divers times put for Iudah, none vvil deny. Among ma∣ny other places, see these, towching the terme Jacob, and the house of Jacob, Esa. 8, 17. and 48, 1. Jer. 5, 20. Lam. 1, 17. and 2, 2. Obad. v. 10. and 11. Mic. 2, 12. and 3, 1, 8, 9. Nahum 2, 2. And for the terme of the people of the Lord, applyed to Iudah, Jer. 2, 11, 13, 31, 32. and 4, 11, 22. and 5, 31. and 6, 27. and 8, 7. and 23, 2, 22, 27, 32. Ezech. 13, 10, 18, 19. Joel. 2, 17, 18, 19, 26. Obad. v. 13. Zeph. 2, 10. & in an hundred places besides. 3. The particular termes of Zion,, Jerusalem, the mountayn of the Lords house, and the like used in this prophecy. Mic. 3, 9, 10, 12. and 4, 7, 8, &c. 4. The sharp denunciation uttered by Micah, where he saith: Zion for your sake shalbe plowed as a field, and Ierusalem shall become heaps, and the mountayne of the house, as the high places of the forest: Mic. 3, 12. is expresly noted, to haue ben spoken in the daies of Hezekiah king of Iudah, to al the people of Iudah, Jer. 26, 18. which is very specially to be observed. 5. The direct and particular mention, that the daughter of Zion shall goe forth of the city (Ierusalem) euen unto Babylon. Mic. 4, 10. By all vvhich, and the like that in this Prophet may be observed, it can not be denyed but that this prophecy was directed to Iudah aswell as to Israell. Whither also may be referred the generall reasons herePag. 105. before alledged, concerning them both. Whereupon vvill followe (upon these mens assertion) that if the Scriptures here cited by them will beare their inference, and be applyed to Iudah, that they then were not the church and people of God neither, however they would be so esteemed and na∣med. And so vvhatsoever they would bring upon Israell in this behalf, is now by themselues brought upon Iudah: so as Iudah (by their assertions) was not now the Lords, not the people of the Lord, nor his vvife, nor under his co∣venant, nor a true church, nor had circumcision, or other ordinances of the Lord, that
vvere the Lords signes and seales of his covenant and forgiuenes of sinnes, but such a vvere in their use false and deceitfull, cursed and detestable, and what not, if we should beleeue their assertions and conclusions. But vvhether in deed such stuffe and dealing of theirs, be not rather to be esteemed false and deceitfull, accursed and detestable, let the godly vvise judge. Touching Hos. 2.18.19.20.23. The next Scriptures here alledged, are Hos. 2, 18, 19, 20, 23. vvhich speak of the time to come after their exile and casting out of the land,Hos. 2, 18.19, 20, 23. vvhen they should againe return unto the Lord (agreeing with that vvhich fol∣loweth in the next chapter, Hos. 3, 4, 5.) vvhereas our question is of their estate and condition vvith the Lord, vvhiles they vvere yet in the land; and not cast out of his house or presence as yet, but beloved, pitied, and holpen of the Lord: as appeareth by that vvhich vvent before and fol∣lovveth after in this prophecy of Hoseah, and by the historie it self, 2 Kin. 13, 23. and 14, 25, 26, 27. and in many other places both of the historie, and of the Prophets: asPag. 58. &c. here before I haue shevved in sundry particulars: vvhich I need not repeat. Touching Ioh. 10.16. Act. 18, 10. 1 Cor. 12, 2. Rom. 11, 11, 20, 23.25, 26. and 9, 4. with Esa. 59, 20, 21. Ezech. 34, 23 — 30. Hos. 3, 5. By this also may appeare, how that which he annexeth, of the Gentiles called Christs sheep, because they should be brought into his fold; and of the Ievves called Gods people and beloved, because they shalbe graffed againe into Christ: is not to the point and question in hand. And so the Scriptures also vvhich here they cite, abused in this behalf. viz. Ioh. 10, 16. Act. 18, 10. 1 Cor, 12, 2. Rom. 11, 11, 20, 23, 25, 26. and 9, 4. with Esa. 59, 20, 21. Ezec. 34, 23 — 30. Hos. 3, 5. inas∣much as they speak of the estate of Ievves & Gentiles for time to come; vvhereas our question, and the Scriptures speaches alledged by us, are of Israell, for the time then present, vvhen novv they vvere in the land of promise, not cast out by the Lord as yet. Which may suffice for a ful aun∣svver hereunto. Yet some other things also may be noted, that vvil giue further light and confirmation hereunto. As first, that thus he vvould make Israels estate, vvhiles yet they re∣mayned in the land of promise, and under the Lords covenant, having also the great things of his lavv vvritten unto them, &c. to be like the estate of the Heathens, vvhiles they vvere straungers from the covenants of promise, and had not the vvord and statutes of the Lord giuen unto them: &c. Which I haue noted here before among his errours. Secondly, that he makes the estate of Israell, vvhiles they vvere in the Lords land, and before Christ vvas exhibited (as is aforesaid:) to be like the estate of the Ievves at this day, vvhen they are novv cast avvay for a time & some of the braunches broken of, Christ being come in the flesh, and refused by them, &c. Rom. 11, 11, 12, 15, 17, 20, 25. Thirdly, that in this treatise of his, he so speaketh of Israell of old, and
of the Iewes at this day: as if the Lords covenant, euen on his part, were not an everlasting covenant, stable and enduring for ever, concerning them. Whereas the Lord himself saith, I will establish my covenant betvveen me and thee (speaking to Abraham) and thy seed after thee, in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. Gen. 17, 7. And afterward again to David, I haue made a covenant with my cho∣sen: I haue sworne unto David my servant. Thy seed will I stablish for ever: and build up thy throne to all generations. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore: and my covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed also will I make to endure for ever: and his throne as the dayes of heauen.Note this well. If his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments: if they break (or pro∣fane) my Statutes, and keep not my commandements: then vvill I visit their transgression with the rodde, and their iniquitie with stripes. Neverthelesse, my loving kindnesse will I not make frustrate with him, nor lye (or, deale falsely) against my faithfulnesse.Note th well. My covenant will I not break (or, profane:) nor alter the thing that is gone gone out of my lippes, &c. Psa. 89, 3, 4.28, 29, 30. &c. And againe in the Psalmes, He will remember his covenant for ever. He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his Name. Psal. 111.5.9. And in Ezechiell the Prophet. Thus saith the Lord God, I will even deale with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the Co∣venant. Nevertheles I wil remember my Covenant with thee in the daies of thy youth, & I wil establish unto thee an everlasting Covenant. Then thou shalt remember thy wayes and be asha∣med, when thou shalt receiue thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger, & I wil giue them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy Covenant. And I will establish my Covenant vvith thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord: That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, & never open thy mouth any more: because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God. Ezec. 16.59 — 63. [And in Esay the Prophet, The moun∣taynes shall depart, and the hils be removed: but my kindnesse shall not depart from thee, ney∣ther shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee. Esa. 54.10. [And again,] The Redeemer shall come to Sion, & unto them that turne from transgression in Iacob, saith the Lord. As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the Lord, My spirit that is upon thee, & my words which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth, and for ever. Esa. 59.20.21. with Rom. 11.25.26.27. vvhich last pla∣ces (except the last verse) are here mentioned by himself. And agreeably vvith the Prophets, the Apostles also (speaking of the Ievves, and of Gods dealing with them) teach us, that the gifts and calling of God are without repentance, such as he cannot repent of and alter. Rom. 11, 29. And it were endles to note all the places, and gather the manifold reasons and assertions, vvhich the Prophets & Apostles haue hereabout. Now for the point it self (considering the perversenesse and wrangling disposition of many) I had rather propound what others haue observed concerning it, then further deliver myne ovvne mynd, or insist longer thereupon. Marke therefore vvhat M. Calvin saith touching this matter:Calvin in Ier. 2, 2. writing upon Ier. 2, 2. This is a very worthy place (sayth he) because God shevveth that his covenant, though it vvere perfidiouslly violated by the Iewes, yet is firme and stable. For although not al,Rom. 11, 25. that come of Abraham according to the flesh be true and right Isra∣elites: yet God alvvaies abideth true, and his calling is without repentance, as Paul teacheth. And againe, writing upon Ezech. 16, 61.Calvin in. Zac. 10, 6. The Lord said a litle before, [I vvill remember my covenant:] now he saith, [not by thy covenant.] He reconcileth therefore those things that might seem contrary: to wit, that himself vvould be myndfull of his covenant, and yet that covenant to be dissipated, broken, and abolished. He sheweth that the covenant is firme on his part (as men use to speak:) but is voyde on the peoples part. And on Zath. 10, 6. “ Whereas here God saith, that he cast away his people, it must be referred to the sense & opinion of men, as otherwhere we haue seen: for the adoption
vvas stable: but the outvvard appearance might giue another judgement, namely that that peo∣ple vvas rejected of God. But yet the Prophets meaning is cleare, to wit, that although God had dealt severely with that people, and had most grievously punished their perfidiousnes, yet the a∣vengement should not be eternall, because he will giue place to his mercy. Agayne he annexeth the reason, [because I am the Lord their God, sayth he.] By this clause he signifieth that the ad∣option is not voyd, although for a time he cast away the Ievves. For calling himself [their God,] he setteth before us the remembrance of his covenant: as if he should say, that he did not in vaine make covenant vvith Abraham, and promised that his seed should be blessed. Therefore because God bound himself by promise to Abraham, here he saith [he is that peoples God:] not that he ought any thing unto them, but because of his free grace he chose aswell Abraham as his seed. &c. Many the like sayings and observations, might be noted also out of o∣ther writers. But omitting them, I will rather note somewhat out of the Scriptures here alledged by themselues. As namely, in Rom. 11, 11. where Paul speaking of the present estate of the Ievves, who refused Christ be∣ing exhibited in the flesh: saith thus,Rom. 11, 11. Haue they stumbled that they should fal? God forbid. Whereas by these mens doctrine, Israell had so stumbled and fallen, as euen before Christs coming, whiles they remained in the land of promise, they were not Gods people, and under his covenant, &c. And in Rom. 11, 20. the Apostle speaking of the estate of the Ievves at this day, saith:Rom. 11, 20. Because of unbelief they vvere broken off. But shall their unbe∣lief make the faith of God vvithout effect? God forbid. Yea, let God be true, but every man a lyar: as the Apostle teacheth othervvhere, Rom. 3, 3.4. and here again annexeth, that they also, if they bide not still in unbelief, shalbe graffed in: for God is able to graffe them in againe. Rom. 11, 23. Rom. 11, 25.And Rom. 11, 25. addeth further, I would not brethren (speaking to the Gen∣tiles) that ye should be ignorant of this mysterie (least ye should be wise in your owne conceits) that blyndnes in part is happened to Israel, untill the fulnesse of the Gentiles be come in. In part (he saith) not totally or finally: & on their part, through their unbelief: vvhereas the faith and covenant of the Lord, on his part, is firme and stable for ever: vvho therefore wil graffe the Iewes (the na∣turall braunches) into their owne Oliue tree againe: And so all Israell shall be saved, as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodlines from Jacob. Rom. 11.26. Where also the terme of Iacob, calleth to remembrance both the Lords covenant made with Iacob, and the stabi∣lity thereof for ever. Gen. 28, 13, 14, 15. Psal. 47, 4. and 105, 8, 9, 10. Amo. 7, 2, 5. Luke 1, 54, 55, 72, 73. Heb. 6, 17, 18. and 11, 9, 16. Which this man himself (if he would haue sette himself to obserue it) could haue noted out of the very next words, in the same place vvhich here he alledgeth: where presently it followeth, For this is my covenant unto them, vvhen I shall take avvay their sinnes. Rom. 11, 27. vvhere he speaketh ex∣pressely of the Lords covenant unto them, shewing both the stability thereof, and making it the fountaine and ground of this mercy of the Lord unto them. Like as also in the next verses follovving, he doeth yet further de∣clare and confirme it, vvhen he saith: As concerning the Gospell, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers sakes. For the gifts and calling of God are vvithout repentance. Rom. 11, 28, 29.
Vpon which Scripture, M. Beza writeth thus:Bez. An∣not. in Rom. 11, 28. This place doeth manifest¦ly shevv, that Paul treateth not of every particular Iew, but of the Iewish nation in general, who as touching the Gospell, that is, inasmuch as it admitteth not the Gospell, to wit, in their present estate, are [enemies, or] hatefull to God: but as touching the election (that is, inasmuch as God considereth not what they deserue but what himself promised to Abraham and his seed are be∣loved of God, and therefore will he in his time vouchsafe them his grace and favour: because, although every man be a lyar, yetNote these things. God will not chaunge his counsell. And this is a most firme argument, as being such which is taken from the very nature of God. But this is to be noted again, that here the treating is of the Iewish nation in generall, & ofNote these things. the perpetuall covenant. For God hath his decrees touching particulars, which derogate not from that generality, though they be contrary: as for example, that God hath chosen the Iewes, and yet hath appointed di∣vers of them to just destruction. Also he decreeth many things for a tyme, which afterward he chaungeth. Yet is he not therefore to be esteemed changeable, but rather alwayes like himself: because that the things which he hath decreed should be perpetuall (as,Note these things. this covenant with Abraham and his seed) they remayne perpetuall: but the things which he hath decreed to be changed in their times (as we see the interchangeable & succeeding course of things every mo∣ment:) or to be abrogated, (as is come to passe with the legall ceremonies) they also at their cer∣taine times are chaunged and abrogated. Hitherto M. Beza. And whether the man with whom we haue to doe, did not obserue thus much himself, may be doubted. Els vvhen here he citeth, Rom. 11, 11, 20, 23, 25, 26. vvhy should he stay there, and not cite also the next verses, ver. 27, 28, 29. specially seeing the terme (beloved) now at∣tributed to the Iewes (on vvhich here he insisteth) is not in any of the ver∣ses vvhich he alledgeth; but is used in ver. 28, vvhich he omitteth. Which if he had but cited, and the Reader observed, he should haue found toge∣ther with mention of the terme beloved, the ground also & reason there∣of to be Gods election, and the covenant made with their Fathers, and that un∣changeably. ver. 28, with 27, & 29. All which doe both manifest his shifts, and convince his erroneous assertions, concerning Israell. Here also is to be observed, how speaking of the Ievves novv to be be∣loved: besides that he citeth not the verse, where that terme is used, he al∣so leaveth the phrases of speach used by the Apostle in the same verse: vvhich are these,Rom. 11, 28. As concerning the Gospell, the Ievves are enemies (for which he hath, their present estate is cursed) for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers sakes: For which he hath (omitting vvholly the terme of electiō) for the promise that they shal hereafter be graffed again into Christ. Where∣as if he had kept the termes used by the Apostle in the same verse, the matter vvould haue ben plainer against himself, touching the eternity & unchangeablenes of Gods election and covenant, on which we insist. If he say, that Paul in the same chapter also useth the phrase of graffing them againe: I denye it not. But he useth it not in this verse now spoken off, where he sheweth how they are beloved, for the fathers sakes, and so for the covenant, in regard of Gods election. Rom. 11, 28. And vvhere he speaketh of their graffing in againe, it is in respect of their being broken off through their unbelief and disobedience of the Gospell. Rom. 11, 20.23. And this also, but of some of the braunches, not of the vvhole tree. Rom. 11, 16. Besides that mans unbelief cannot make the faith of God to be of none effect. Rom. 3, 3, 4. 2 Tim. 2, 13. And by this occasion note here, how the same persons (the Ievves) are enemies in one respect, & beloved in another respect: Enemies, in themselues;
beloved, of the Lord: Enemies, because of their unbelief, and refusall of the Gospell; beloved because of the election, and covenant of the Lord made vvith the Fathers and their seed. Rom. 11, 28. And consequently, how good and needfull it is (as cases require it) to consider and speak of the same persons diversely, in divers respects: As also, to put difference in the con∣sideration of the covenant, betvveen that which concerneth the Lord, on his part; and that vvhich concerneth man, on theirs. Which when we doe (upon some occasions) touching Israell, the church of Rome, or o∣thers in like sort: hovv common then is it vvith these men to open the throat, & fil their mouths with odious exclamations. But let them hence∣forth be more carefull to lay their hand on their mouth, & to learne bet∣ter, euen by this distinction and maner of speach, which the Apostle hathRom. 11, 28. in this place: besides infinite other the like throughout the Scriptures: vvhereof I haue giuen some instancesert. p. 4. otherwhere. Vnto which I will here now also annex these: That the Ievves who for2 Kin. 24 , &c. Ier. 11. and 13 and 14. & 15, & 18, and 22 ch. &c. Dan. 9, 2.5. &c. their sinnes and vvickednes were caried captiue to Babylon, in Iecho∣niahs time, are called good figges, and very good: in respect of Zedekiah and the other Ievves that remayned at Ierusalem, called naughty figges, for whō greater punishment was reserved. Ier. 24, 1, 2, 3, 5, &c. Also Zedechiah is Iechoniahs uncle, 2 Kin. 24, 17. and his sonne, 1 Chro. 3, 16. and his brother, 2 Chron. 36, 10. in divers respects. The place of the holy city, is called pro∣fane, Ezec. 48, 15. and 42, 20. yet the name of the city is, The Lord is there, Ezech. 48, 35. and that place in other respect may be considered as a part of the holy oblation, Ezec. 48, 8 — 20. with 45, 1. &c. as Ierusalem also is called the holy city, Neh. 11, 1, 8. Mat. 4, 5. and 27, 53. And the faithful ci∣ty becometh an harlot; and yet is still the daughter of Zion, the house of Iacob, the Church and people of God. Esa. 1, 1, 21. with 10, 32. and 37, 22. Ier 2, 4, 13. and 5, 20, 21. Mic. 2, 5. and 3, 1, 9, 10. &c. And very many such like every where in the Scripture may be observed. And hitherto of Rom 11, 11, 20, 23, 25, 26. vvhich he citeth: and of ver. 27, 28, 29. the citation of which verses he omitteth: whereas they are spe∣cially to be observed, for confirmation and assurance of the perpetuity & unchaungeablenes of the Lords covenant made vvith the Fathers, Abra∣ham, Isaac, Iacob, and their seed for ever. Rom. 9.4Like things may be observed out of the other Scriptures here cited by him: as Rom. 9, 4. with vvhich he should haue joyned also ver. 5. vvhere the Apostle shevveth, that to the Iewes apperteyne the adoption, covenants, promi∣ses,Esa. 59.20 21.  Fathers, &c. And Esa. 59, 20, 21. vvhere the Prophet teacheth, that the Lords covenant is with them, and their seed for ever. And Ezech. 34, 23 — 30. where the fruits of the Lords eternall covenant vvith his people are largely de∣scribed euen 2, 25. vvhen he shall haue punished them for their sinnes, and avenged the quarrell of his covenant upon them: Where also is speci∣ally to be observed, how he is still called the Lord then God, and they his people, ver. 30. which are the words of the covenant. And where moreover vve may learn to put difference between this phrase, of the Lord being their
God, and they his people (vvhich is so, euenPsal. 89, 30— 34. & 106, 43, 44, 45. when and vvhiles the Lord doth visit their iniquities with the rod) & betvveen their knovving of the Lord their God to be vvith them, and they to be his people, by the enjoying of his mercies and fruits of his favour, according to his adoption and eternal covenant. ver. 30. and 31. Like as there is difference, betvveeneEzec. 2, 3. & 33, 7. Zac. 1, 1. & 2, 3, 4. a Prophets being a∣mong them, & betweenEze. 2, 5. & 33, 33. Zach. 2, 9.11. their knowing of this, that a Prophet hath ben among thē. Finally note here, hovv this being the onely place (of all those that he al∣ledgeth together) vvhere the title of Gods people (vvhereof he speaketh) is ascribed unto them: the Prophet in this place, speaketh not simply or onely of their being Gods people, but of their knowing (and finding by experi∣ence) that the Lord their God is vvith them, and that they are his people. Which being well observed, as I haue shevved here before, is the more against this man himself. Like as also is the next and last place, which he citeth out of Hos. 3, 5.Hos. 3, 5. vvhere it is expressely said, that vvhen the children of Israel (being put out of the land, and punished for their idolatrie and other sinnes) shal haue fit ma∣ny dayes without a king, &c. then afterward they shall returne, and seek the Lord their God (which are the vvords of the covenant) and David their king, and shall feare the Lord, and his goodnes in the latter dayes. By vvhich it is evident that there is (all that time) no default on the Lords part, but that it is vvholly of themselues, vvho in so long a time doe not returne and seek the Lord their God, and Christ their king, nor fear the Lord, and come to his good∣nesse all this while. And vvhereas he speaketh of this people being called beloved, in respect of their estate to come: he may see in the beginning of this chapter (but three or four verses before that which he citeth) that this term of beloved, yea beloved of their friend and husband, was ascribed unto them by the Lord, vvhen Hoseah prophecied, notwithstanding their adulterous estate, being idolaters and apostates. The vvords are these, (vvhich upon like occasion haue ben treated off before.) Then said the Lord unto me (saith Hoseah,) Goe yet, loue a woman (beloved of herOr, hus∣band. as Ier. 3, 20. friend, yet an adulteresse) according to the loue of the Lord toward the children of Israell, who look to other Gods, and loue flagons of vvine. Hos. 3, 1. Which Scripture (being vvell considered, and compared vvith the other Scriptures aforesaid) doeth so evidently convince this mans erroneous assertions, and abuse of Scriptures: as it may suffice for answer and refutation of all that he hath throughout his treatise about the matters aforesaid. And hitherto of these objections concerning the circumcision & estate of Israell. Some other things moe of like sort doth this man and others except hereabout: vvhich I need not novv stand upon. By that vvhich hath ben said the discreet Reader wil find how to answer any other obje∣ctions which they bring hereabout. And in the things aforesaid, I haue vvritten more largely then I purposed: that so I might vvith one labour both more convince them, and better informe the Reader concerning these things. Yet there being another objection or tvvo that are much
urged about this matter: I vvill novv also in particular annex somewhat further thereabout: and then (God vvilling) proceed to other matters, vvhich are novv likewise much called in question. OBIECTION VI. But if Israel now were the church and people of God, then ought none to haue left them: it had ben schisme so to doe. &c. ANSWER. 1. Nay. the same Prophets that acknovvledged them to be the people of the Lord: yet taught all to leaue and forsake their sinfull estate & false vvorship, vvhereinto they vvere fallen: being novv become idolaters, a∣postates, schismaticks, that had divided themselues from Iudah, &c. Hos. 4, 15, 16, 17. and 5, 2, 3, 11. and 11, 12. Amos 4, 4, 5. and 5, 4, 5. with Mic. 1, 5, 13. & 2, 5. and 6, 16. 2. Euen in Iudah also it may be observed, that both in the time of Ma∣nasseh, vvhen he set up a grauen image in the Temple of God, and caused Iudah to sinne vvith his idols; as also in the dayes of Iehojakim: & long after in the time of the Machabees, vvhen Antiochus set up his idoll and other profanations in the Lords sanctuarie: then the faithfull & syncere vvorshippers of God, refused to communicate vvith them in their idola∣trie, and chose rather to suffer affliction, and death it self: so as Ierusalem vvas filled vvith innocent blood. 2 King. 21, 1 — 16. and 23, 36, 37. and 24, 3. 4. Dan. 11, 31, 32, 33. with 1 Machab. 1 ch. and 2 Mach. 6, & 7 ch. and Heb. 11, 35, 36, 37, 38. Yet was Iudah still acknowledged by the Prophets to be the church and people of God: as hath ben shewed here before, and may be seen throughout the historie and their Prophecies. 3. And when Esay vvas enjoyned by the Lord, (in Ahaz dayes) to bynd up the Testimonie, and scale the Law among his disciples: so keeping it from the wicked and perverse, that stubburnely despised the word of God, & com∣municating it onely with the godly: Esa. 8, 16. with 7, 1. 2 Chron. 28, chapt. yet euen then also he acknovvledgeth them to be the house of Jacob, from whom the Lord hid his face: and the people of God, that should seek unto him, & to his law & testimonie. Esa. 8, 17, 19, 20. with 1, 3. and 3, 15. & 10, 2, 24. 4. The Prophet Amos also, (teaching the people to avoyd al places & assemblies of idolatrie and false vvorship) did not onely teach them not to seek Bethel, nor to enter into Gilgal, (which vvere places in Israel) but taught them also not to passe over to Beershebah; (vvhich was1 Kin. 19 3. a city in Iudah) Amo. 5, 5. Yet did he acknovvledge them to be the familie of Israell, which God brought out of Egypt; and the people of God; euen Jacob, the Lords covenanted people, &c. (as I haue shevved more largelyPag. 62, 83. here before) Amo. 3, 1, 2. & 5, 1. and 7, 2, 5, 15. So vvhether it be Iudah or Israel (& consequently other Churches, better or worse) they may be acknovvledged for the churches and people of God; and yet must be left, vvhen they stand in apostasie, schisme, idolatrie, &c. and not be communicated vvithall in such sinfull estate and transgression.
5. Here therefore is to be observed, that as they are the church and people of God, none are to leaue or refuse communion with them: but onely as they stand in apostasy, schisme, false vvorship, &c. Neyther Israel nor Iudah might be left, nor the Temple in Ierusalem, as they were the people and Temple of God, but as Ieroboam caused Israell to sinne, setting up the calues at Dan and Bethell, &c. & as Manasseh polluted the house of God and caused Iudah to sinne vvith his idols, & Antiochus pro∣faned the Sanctuarie, and compelled the Iewes to transgresse the Law of God, &c. Yea euen touching the Church of Rome also in particular, vve neyther doe nor may leaue it, as it is the Temple and church of God; but as Antichrist sitteth therein, opposing and exalting himself aboue all that is called God or that is divine, polluting the Temple and vvorship of God, &c. Rom. 1, 7, &c. compared with 2 Thes. 2, 4. and Rev 11, 1, 2, 3. &c, Which being observed, vve doe and may (yea and ought to) acknovvledge & re∣teyn any doctrine of trueth & ordinances of God stil had among them: and yet are bound to leaue their corrupt and sinfull estate; and in obe∣dience to God, according to his word, to returne to the auncient estate of that and the other primitiue churches, as they vvere planted by the Apostles in the fayth and order of Christ. Rev. 14, 9 — 12. and 18, 4. and 22, 14. with Jer. 6, 16. and 18, 15. Song. 1, 7, 8. 6. Moreover it is vvell known, that among such as doe much urge this objection, there are some vvho haue left the French reformed Church in Amst. for some things now had & continued in that church. Whereupon it will necessarily follow, that eyther they hold a true church may be left, for some things had among them, and yet be held to be the Church of God notwithstanding: or els that they hold not the French church afore∣said to be the church of God, in their estate. Let them novv tel vvhether. 7. It is also Popish to hold, that the church cannot erre; And Anaba∣ptisticall to think, that when a church so erreth as it falleth into idolatry, apostasie, or the like transgressions, then they cease to be the church and people of God any longer; and very Popish again & in deed irreligious, under the title of the church of God, to urge all eyther to walk as them∣selues doe (what ever transgressions they haue against the word of God) or els to account thē hereticks, schismaticks, seditious, singular, new fang∣led, that refuse so to doe, endevouring to vvalk in the faith and order of Christ in all things, according to the word of God. 8. Whereupon it cometh to passe in this case, as heretofore it did, when that was counted heresy in the Apostles and primitiue Churches, which vvas not so in deed. Act. 24, 5, 14. So now at this day both by Papists and others that is often esteemed to be schisme, which in deed is not so. True it is, that schisme is very carefully & religiously to be avoyded, vvhether it be factious division in the Church, or scandalous departing from it 1 Cor. 11, 18, 19. Rom. 16, 17. Heb. 10, 25. Iude v. 11, & 16, & 19. God hath set an order in his church, and appointed bounds and limits, which none hould transgresse. Col, 2, 5. 1 Cor. 14, 33 — 40. 1 Thes. 5, 14. Iude ver. 19. with
Psal. 17, 4. Schismes and divisions, hatred and variance, emulations and vvrath, strife and envyings are among the works of the flesh: of vvhich the Apostle teacheth, that they vvhich doe such things, shall not inherit the kingdome of God. 1 Cor. 3, 3, 4. Gal. 5, 19, 20, 21. But on the other hand, syncere obedience unto God, and an holy keeping of the fayth, worship, & order, which he hath once giuen unto his church, is very carefully also to be reteyned, and religiously to be performed: notwithstanding the prohibition or opposition of any Princes, Prelates, people, churches, or other persons vvhosoever. For the Lord hath promised to shevv mercy to those that loue him, and keep his commandements; and threatned to visit the iniquitie of such as hate him, and follow their ovvne inventions & misconceived courses, in his vvorship & service, &c. Exo. 20, 4, 5, 6. Lev. 10 chap. Numb. 16 ch. Esa. 29, 13, 14. and 65, 2 — 7. Jer. 6, 14 — 17. and 18, 15. Mat. 15, 7, 8, 9. and 28, 20. Col. 2, 5. 1 Tim. 6, 13, 14. Iude v. 3 — 23. Rev. 2, 10, 24, 25, 26. and 14, 12. and 22, 14, 18, 19. But here it will be demaunded, when & how we may knovv the estate of any church or churches to be such, as we may leaue it, or not. Touch∣ing vvhich question although I had rather heare & learne of others, then set dovvne myne ovvn mynd: specially considering vvhat Opposites I haue of sundry sorts, and vvhat great difficulties and waighty consequen∣ces, doe follovv about this matter every way: Yet being desirous that the trueth and vvill of God herein, may (vvhat in us is) be found out and observed: I am not unvvilling to note downe some fevv things, that I haue observed from the word of God hereabout: leaving them to be ex∣amined by the Scriptures, and both other things also to be annexed, and these things withall to be further or otherwise observed, as shalbe found to be most according to God and godlynes. And these they are: viz. That no churches of God are to be left, though having or falling into errors and corruptions: 1. If their consti∣tution be such, as the Churches and Pastors thereof, stand (as touching their ecclesiasticall estate) immediately under Iesus Christ: as did each of the churches of Asia, with the Angels thereof, and all the other Primi∣tiue Churches planted by the Apostles, &c. Rev. 2, 1, 7, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7, 14. Act. 14, 23. and 20, 17, 28. with the churches at Rom. Cor. Gal. Eph. Phi. Col. Thes. &c. 2. If they also haue and reteyne povver vvithin themselues, to redresse any errour or corruption, and to receiue any truth of God, as it shalbe revealed unto them, and they perswaded thereof, by the vvord of God. As may be seen also in the Churches aforesaid. 3. And if the Ministers and other members of the church, be not urged in their owne persons, to any thing wherein they should sinne and trans∣gresse the lavv of God: but be left free for themselues and their owne practise, to keep the lavves and ordinances of God, according to their places and occasions. As may be seen in the church of the Iewes (where∣in vvere corruptions sundry times and of sundry sorts:) vvhere yet the Prophets, and other godly persons in divers ages, and Christ himself, &
his disciples thus lived among thē.See 1 Kin. 14, 21-24. and 15, 1, 2, 3. &c. with 2 Chron. 12. & 13. and 14 ch. &c. For vvhich see the historie and estate of the Iewes, in the time of the Judges, and of Rehoboam, Abiiah, &c. Also Esa. 1, 1. &c. Ier. 1, 1, 2, 3. &c. Ezech. 1, and 2, and 3, and 16. and 20 ch. &c. Dan. 1, 1, 8. and 9, 23. Mic. 1, 1, 11. &c. Zeph. 1, 1, &c. Hag. 1, 1, &c. Zach. 1, 1. &c. Mal. 1, 1. &c. with the historie in Ezra and Nehemiah. And Matt. 3 ch. and 4, 23. and 23 ch. and 26, 17 — 20. Luke 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 21. and 2, 21, 22, 23, 24. and 4, 16 — 20. and 21, 37, 38. Joh. 2, 13, 23. and 6, 4. and 11, 55. and 13, 1. Act. 13, 14, 14. and 17, 1, 2, 3. 4. Lastly, if they doe not obstinately refuse the truth & way God whē it is manifested unto them: perversely withstanding it themselues; spea∣king evil thereof before others; reviling & persecuting such as teach or receiue it, &c. As may be seen in the said Church and Synagogues of the Ievves, vvhich were not left, untill they came to this untoward and per∣verse estate and condition. For which see the historie of the Euangelists, and Acts of the Apostles: & particularly, Act. 2, 40. and 7, 51, 52. and 13, 14 — 45 — 51. and 18, 6. and 19, 8, 9. and 28, 23 — 28. 1 Tim. 6, 3, 4, 5. and 2 Tim. 3, 1 — 5 — 11. &c. But if any churches fall into apostasie, and become so degenerate, as they & their Pastors come to stand under an Antichristian hierarchie, or popular anarchie: and reteyne not power vvithin themselues, according to the word of God to receiue any trueth shewed unto them, and to re∣dresse any error or corruption arising among them: but that the ministers and members are urged in their ovvn persons to such actions and duties as they cannot performe without sinne; neyther can be suffred to keepe vvhatsoever Christ hath commaunded them: but must hold such a faith, performe such a worship, obserue such an order, as is prescribed or al∣lowed by Princes, Prelates, people, &c. that now any vvho knowe the trueth and discern the corruptions of such churches, should still remaine Ministers or members thereof in such estate, and so liue and dye: I wish that such as are thus mynded or inclining this vvay, vvould plainely set downe their opinions and reasons from the Word of God, concerning this matter. Or if they like not of this maner of propounding of it, as here I haue done: that themselues vvould distinctly set down their owne opinions hereabout, alvvaies keeping to the points in controversy, and insisting upon the things called in question: omitting to speak of such things, whether touching faith, worship, or order, as are agreed upon on all hands. And thus much for the present touching the Objection aforesaid: novv I proceed to the next and last concerning these matters. OBIECTON VII. ButThe Ana¦bapt. The Cha∣ract of the bapt. p. 48. M. Ains. Animad p 98-76 98. &c. the Church of Rome (whereunto many things are applyed, that are ta∣ken from Israell) is not the Church of God, nor under the covenant of God; nor hath any of the Lords posts or ordinances left in it: but is divorced from the Lord: &c. Neyther is the church of England the Church of God, ha∣ving his covenant, but is likewise divorced from the Lord, &c. Therefore also the baptisme had in those Churches and the like, is not true baptisme, but
an idoll,Iustif. p. 121 278. 461. & others. a fiction, a lying and deceitfull signe, a cursed and detestable sacra∣ment. &c. ANSWER. This objection is of much like sort with those which we had before touching Israell, and the circumcision thereof: Whereunto therefore like ansvver may be giuen in sundry respects: so as the former answers and reasons (many of them) may hither likewise be referred. Neyther the things onely that are spoken of Israel, but those also vvhich concerne Iu∣dah, in her apostasie and defection: whereunto the estate of the Christian apostate church may fitly haue reference, in divers respects. Which would be long to rehearse and insist upon in particular. The indifferent Reader vvill carefully obserue it. And the point it self is plaine ynough and undenyable, by the reference vvhich the Scripture in sundry things maketh thereunto. 2 Thes. 2, 4. 2 Pet. 2, 1. Rev. 11, 1 — 6. and 12, 5, 6, 14. and 13, 5, 6. and 14, 1, 15. and 16, 12 — 16. and 19, 1. &c. Yet considering the objecti∣on here made, together with the continuall urging thereof; and how pi∣teously the Anabaptists and others are by this meanes overcaried with prejudice, and drawen from the vvay of trueth to great error and iniqui∣tie: I haue thought it not amisse to note also somevvhat hereabout. And first (to speak of the church of Rome in particular) I pray all to take knowledge, that my mynd and desire in my self is (and, I trust, shal∣be alway) to plead against the present estate of that church, and not for it: acknovvledging it to be fallen into most sinful and deep defection and a∣postasie; and so to be a notorious harlot and idolatresse: vvhich all the people of God ought to forsake, and to vvitnesse the trueth thereagainst, euen unto death. Yet being also desirous (as I signified erewhile about an other matter) that in al these things the truth may be found out, what vve can; and fynding that the Prophets vvhich accountedEsa. 1, 21 Ier. 3, 3, 20 Eze. 16, 35 Hos. 2, 2, 5 Ierusalem & Israell to be harlots; and pronouncedEsa. 57.3 4, 5. Ier. 2 and 7, and 44 ch. Hos. 2, 4. and 4, 12. the children of Iudah and Israel to be the sonnes of the sorceresse, the seed of the adulterer, & vvhore, the children of trans∣gression, a seed of falsehood; inflaming themselves vvith idols under every green tree; slay∣ing the children in the valleyes; going a vvhoring from under their God. Yea,Ezec. 23 2 — 43. &c with 16, 2, 3 — 44. &c both of them (Aholah, and Aholibah, Israell and Iudah) to be the daughters of one mo∣ther; who committed whoredomes in Egypt in their youth, and afterward in the land of Canaan grew old in adulteries; euen such as should be judged byEzec. 16, 38. the Lord, &and 23, 4. by righ∣teous men, after the manner of adulteresses, & after the manner of womē that shed blood: because they were adulteresses, and blood was in their hands, &c. did yet notwith∣standing in other respects acknowledge them also to be the people of God; the house of Jacob; the Lords vineyard; and heritage: the dearly beloved of his soule; the virgin daughter of Zion; the children of Israell beloved of the Lord, as a vvoman that is beloved of her husband, though an adulteresse; the congregation of the Lord; the house of Israell, &c. Esa. 1, 3. and 2, 6. and 3, 12. and 5, 1. and 48, 1. Jer. 2, 4, 11, 13. and 12, 7 — 10 Lam. 1, 15. and 2, 13. Ezech. 4, 5, 6. Hos. 3, 1. and 4, 1. and 5, 1. Amos 5, 1. and 7, 2, 8, 15. Mic. 2, 5. and 3, 1, 3, 5. and 6, 2, 3. These things (I say) con∣sidered,
I haue thought it not amisse here also to obserue somevvhat touching the Apostate churches of Christians: and now more particular∣ly touching the church of Rome, by this occasion. And this the rather, that I may stirre up others (more able) seriously to consider of this mat∣ter, for the further searching out and clearing of the truth therein; and because my self haue heretofore ben drawen to write somewhat of these things already. Which, together vvith that I shall here annex, I doe still leaue to be examined by the word of God. Neyther wil the searching of this matter proue unprofitable, if it be done religiously, but will be of good and necessarie use, both for the more sound convincing of the Pa∣pists, and for preventing manifold errors and evils, whereunto the Ana∣baptists and others are subject in this behalf. Now therefore to proceed and come to the Objection aforesaid. 1. First, I take an argument from the Baptisme had in the churches aforesaid thus. The Baptisme had in the church of Rome,I speake of the out∣ward ba∣ptisme it self: not of the additi∣ons & cor∣ruptions thereabout is the Lords baptisme, the signe & seale of his covenant, the ordinance of God, had in that Church from the Apostles times (before Antichrist there a∣rose) Rom. 6, 2, 3. and so is true baptisme, vvhich is from heauen, and not of men; that one Baptisme, which perteyneth to the body of Christ, Eph. 4, 4, 5. which the Lord hath giuen to his church, and not man: whereof a number of Martyrs and other Christians haue ben and yet are partakers; which such as leaue Antichrists corruptions, ought not to leaue and re∣nounce, but still to reteyne it, as being the Lords; and such as wherevvith they may lavvfully come to the Lords supper; vvhereas no unbaptized person may eat thereof: (As I haue shevvedPap. 27, & 34. &c here before touching these particulars at large:) Therefore the Church of Rome, is the Church of God, and under his covenant, and hath some of the Lords postes & ordi∣nances yet remaining in it, though mixed with their own inventions &c. And if the church of Rome be thus, then the church of England much more; which is already much purged (by the mercy of God) frō the apo∣stasie, iniquitie, & abominations of the church of Rome. Otherwise also what vvill become of these men themselues: who eyther haue no other Baptisme, but that vvhich they had in the churches aforesaid: or if they take another unto themselues, run a vvhoring after their owne inventi∣ons, vvithout any vvarrant of the word of God: as I haue shewed here before: pag. 27, &c. 2. If the churches of Rome and England be not under the covenant of God, but divorced from the Lord, &c. then is there no salvation for any in those churches. For out of the covenant of God there is no salvation. They vvhich haue not God, to be their God in Iesus Christ, cannot be sa∣ved. And they vvhich are not under the covenant of God, haue not God to be their God in Iesus Christ. Esa. 43, 11. with Act. 4, 12. and Gen. 12, 3. and 17, 7. Act. 2, 38, 39. and 3, 25, 26. and 15, 11. and 16, 31. Joh. 14, 6. 2 Cor. 6, 14 — 18. Rom. 9, 24, 25, 26. and 11, 25, 26, 27. Gal. 3, 8, 15 — 18, 26 — 29. 1 Tim 2, 5. Now touching these churches themselues, great difference is to be observed.
For the church of England, the case is far more evident, and vvithout al colour of question, seeing they doe freely and fully acknowledge justi∣fication by faith onely in Iesus Christ, without any opinion of the merit of works, or intercession of Saints departed, &c. For the church of Rome there is farre more difficultie: where both the merit of works, & inter∣cession of Saints, and the Popes pardons, & purgatorie, with many other notable errors are taught and defended. Yet considering that they pro∣fesse and holdRhemes Annotat. upō 1 Tim. 2, 5. Christ by nature to be truely both God and man, to be that one eternall Priest and redeemer, which by his sacrifice and death upon the crosse hath re∣conciled us to God, and payed his blood as a full and sufficient raunsome for all our sinnes, him∣self without need of any redemption, never subject to possibility of sinning: againe, to be the sin∣gular advocate and Patrone of mankind, that by himself alone and by his owne merites procu∣reth all grace and mercy to mankind in the fight of his Father, none making any intercession for him, nor giueing any grace or force to his prayers, but he to al: none asking or obteyning eyther grace in this life, or glory in the next, but by him: Considering (I say) that thus they professe; although herevvith they haue many great errors and corru∣ptions (as I noted before) by which they are generally seduced and per∣verted: yet vvho dare say, but that God by this faith in Christ saveth some of them, who doe thus beleeue in simplicity, and heare not of their other opinions and courses to be errors and corruptions, nor resist the trueth vvhich God vouchsafeth to shew unto them. And of this mynd concer∣ning them, I haue ben a long time, & haue by other occasionIn the Answer to M. Jacob: p. 13, and 47. &c. published it, almost tvventie yeeres since. And am the more confirmed in it, inas∣much as some of them lay downe their liues and dye Martyrs in defence of the Christian faith (acknovvledging Iesus to be the Christ the sonne of God) against the Turks and Moores and such like enemies of Christian religion: besides that many of the Indians and other Pagans (with some Ievves) are by them converted & brought to the profession of Christian religion: among whom I doubt not but the Lord hath and saveth his; euen by that knovvledge & faith of Iesus Christ, which by their doctrine & preaching among them they are (through the mercy of God) brought unto. Yea and who can say, but that wheresoever the name of Christ is preached and called upon, the Lord saveth some, according to his owne gracious purpose and mercy in Christ Iesus: seeing that Iesus Christ is the vvay, the truth, and the life; and whosoever beleeveth in him shal not perish, but haue everlasting life. Joh. 3, 16, 17. and 6, 35. and 14, 6. Act. 8, 37. and 16, 30, 31. and 17, 2, 3, 4. and 18, 25 — 28. and 28, 14, 23, 24. Rom. 10, 9 — 13. Here also to the same purpose might be observed, that out of the Church there is no salvation: vvhich I suppuse themselues will not deny. And (that which is more) that the Lords constitutions cease not to be his ho∣ly ordinances, though the people that enjoy them, should haue no be∣nefit thereof to salvation, but use, or abuse them rather, to their owne greater condemnation. But omitting this, I proceed to other reasons, as follovveth. 3 It hath ben the great question between the Ievves and us, ever since the Apostles times, and still is, whether Iesus be the Christ that was pro∣mised;
and vvhether the Iewes, or Christians, novv be the church of God. Now also there are in the vvorld the Christians, the Ievves, the Turks, & Pagans. If then the question be asked, vvhich of these is the church of God at this day? should we not ansvver, The Christians: and among the Christians also comprise the churches aforesaid, for the reasons before specified. 4. Seeing baptisme is among Christians a visible signe of the visible Church of God, as circumcision vvas of old among the Ievves: hovv can vve soundly defend & reteyn the visible baptisme received in the church of Rome; and that also vvith reference to the circumcision received in the apostasies of Iudah and Israell: if vve doe not accordingly acknovv∣ledge the Church of Rome, to be a visible church and the people of God, as Iudah and Israell vvas in their defection? (of which more in the next reason follovving.) A visible church, I say: though miserably corrupted, adulterate, and apostate, having Antichrist set therein: &c. Mat. 28, 18, 19. and Act. 2, 41, 47. with Gen. 17, 7 — 12. 1 Cor. 1, 13, 16. and 10, 1, 2. Col. 2, 11, 12. and 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. with Dan. 11, 31, 36. &c. 5. When Ierusalem, the faithfull city, became an harlot; yet vvas it stil the citie of God. Esa. 1, 21. Jer. 2, 3, 13, 20, 21, 27. Ezec. 16, 2 — 35. &c. with Jer. 25, 18, 29. Dan. 9, 18, 19. and with Deut. 28.10. When Iudah fell into idolatrie, apostasie, and other notorious iniquity, yet was itNote the times, and read the histories of the judges and Kings, of Rehobo∣am, Ahaz, Manasseh, Iehojakim, Zedekiah, &c. still the church and people of God; euen vvhen it had the transgressions and idolatries of Is∣raell; the abominations of the heathen; as many Gods, as she had cities; the worship of Baal, and of all the host of heauen; building them high places, images, and groues in every high hill, and under every green tree; forsaking the Lord; and setting an image of jelousy (an idoll of abomina∣tion) in the house of God, vvhere the Lord put his name; her children be∣comming the sonnes of the sorceresse, the seed of the adulterer, and the vvhore, the children of defection, a seed of falsehood; and she her self so abominable, as she justified Samaria and Sodom through her impie∣ties, &c. Iud. 2, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20. &c. 1 King. 14, 21 — 24. 2 King. 16, 10— 16. and 21, 2 — 9. and 23, 31 — 37. and 24 ch. 2 Chron. 12, 1, 5. and 28 ch. and 33, 1 — 10. and 36, 11 — 16. with Esa. 1, 3, 4. and 57, 3, 4, 5. Ier. 2, 11, 13, 27, 28. and 7, 2, 9, 17, 18. & 12, 7 — 10. and 24 ch. and 31, 21, 22. Ezec. 16. and 23 ch. Dan. 8, 10, 11, 12. Mic. 1, 1, 5, 9, 13. and 2, 5. and 2, 1, 3, 5. and 6, 2, 3. The like may be observed touching Israell in her apostasie and defection, as I haue shevved herep. 58, &c. before at large. Therefore also the church of Rome, that was a faithfull church, & is become an harlot, being fallen into idolatrie, apostasie, and other noto∣rious iniquitie, as Ierusalem, Iudah, and Israell heretofore; is in like sort to be estemed the church & people of God, that hath thus offended, & doth thus transgresse, as is aforesaid. The Proposition touching Iudah, and Ie∣rusalem, I suppose these men vvill graunt themselues. Yet for confirma∣tion of it both touching Iudah & Israell, see the Scriptures alledged here and before, besides many moe throughout the historie and Prophets, that might be produced in this behalf. The consequence is proved, because
these were figures and types of the like cases and estate of the Christian churches, recorded for our instruction and learning, 1 Cor. 10, 6 — 11. with Rom. 15, 4. and 2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 2, 1. Iude v. 5, 11. Rev. 2, 14, 20. and 11, 2. &c. And that so, as the Scripture it self maketh these to be the very patternes of the Christians apostasie, and more particularly of the estate of the church of Rome, in this behalf. For vvhich see moreover, 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. compared with 2 King. 21, 7. Esa. 14, 12, 13, 14. Ezec. 8, 3, 5. &c. Dan. 8, 10, 11, 12. and 11, 31, 36, 38. Also Rev. 11, 2, 5, 6, compared vvith the Scriptures aforesaid, and with Esa. 1, 10, 11, 11, 21. Psal. 59, 5. 1 King. 17, 1. and 2 King. 1, 10, &c. Of which more hereafter. 6. And this is the more confirmed, inasmuch as it should be sinne in the church of Rome, for the Papists and apostate Christians, to joyne in mariage with the Pagans; to neglect Baptisme; not to sanctifie the Lords day, &c. as it was in Iudah and Israell (being in apostasie) to joyne in ma∣riage with the heathen; to neglect circumcision; to profane the Lords Sabbaths, &c. Dan. 11, 32. with 1 Machab. 1, 16, 45, 51, 55. and with Mal. 2, 11. Ezra. 9, 1, 2. and 10, 10. Neh. 13, 3, 23 — 27. Also Hos. 5, 7. and 7, 8. and 8, 12. Amo. 8, 5. with 2 Cor. 6, 14. &c. Which should not so be, if they vvere not the people and church of God, under his covenant, and bound to the obser∣vation of his statutes and ordinances. For the Pagans and such as per∣teyne not to the covenant of the Lord, being not his Church and people, are not in their estate bound unto these and the like Ordinances of the Lord, vvhich he hath giuen to his church and people. Psal. 147, 19, 20. with Deut. 7, 1 — 11. 7. The Apostle speaking of Antichrist in his Epistle to the Thessaloni∣ans describeth him thus: There shall come an apostasie (defection or falling a∣way) and the man of sinne shalbe revealed,2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. the sonne of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself aboue al that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he as God sit∣teth in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. &c. 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. Here the apostle describing Antichrist, speaketh of the Temple of God, where he sitteth &c. Novv that by the Temple of God in Israell, vvas figured the Church of God among Christians, appeareth by these Scriptures. 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6, 16. Ephes. 2, 21. Rev. 11, 1, 2, 19. and 14, 15, 17. and 15, 5, 6, 8. and 16, 1, 17. compared vvith Zach. 6, 12, 13. and is acknowledged by the best writers of all ages: who also thus interpret and apply this Scripture in 2 Thes. 2, 4. For which see Amand. Polanus Symphonie, chap. 23, thes. 3. & M. Clift. Advertis. pag. 100— 113. So then from this Scripture, I reason as fol∣loweth. If the Pope of Rome with his hierarchie, be the man of sinne (here spo∣ken off) and the sonne of perdition, vvho opposeth and exalteth him∣self aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped; then is the church of Rome, the Temple of God (here spoken off:) vvherein he sitteth as God, shewing himself that he is God. But the Pope of Rome vvith his hierarchie, is (byM. Ains. Animad. p. 6 — 16. their owne graunt) the man of sinne, of whom the Apostle here speaketh, &c.
Therefore the church of Rome, is the Temple of God also that here is spoken off; &c. Or thus, to like effect. If the Church of Rome be not the Temple of God (and consequently, the church of God) spoken off by the Apostle in this place, 2 Thes. 2, 4. then is not the Pope vvith his hierarchie, the man of sinne (that here is spoken off) and the sonne of perdition, who opposeth and exal∣eth himself aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he as God sitteth in the Temple of God, shevving himself that he is God. 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. But the Pope with his hierarchie, is (by their ovvn acknovvledgement) the man of sinne, here spoken off: &c. Therefore also the church of Rome is the Temple of God (and so, the Church of God) spoken off in this place, 2 Thes. 2, 4. The consequence is necessarie: as appeareth by the expresse words of the text it self, and the comparing of them vvith the Scriptures aforesaid. The reason also is so evidēt, as vvhosoever hold not the church of Rome, to be the church and Temple of God, here spoken of: neyther can they hold, that the Pope of Rome with his hierarchie, is the Antichrist & man of sinne, set therein, as the Apostle here speaketh. And they that acknow∣ledge this, must needs yeeld the other withall. Where (for further manifestation of the point) note & remember still, to put difference betvveen the man of sinne that sitteth, and the Temple of God, wherein he sitteth. Which not being observed aright, (besides many unsound speaches and assertions, that haue passed such as are otherwise good wri∣ters) much error hath risen hereabout, and great confusion of things that differ. See it for more evidence and confirmation hereof, in some other like matters & phrases of Scripture, vvhich may fitly be compared here∣vvith, and vvhereunto this may vvell be referred, in divers respects. In the historie of the Kings and Chronicles, it is recorded that Manasseh king of Iudah (who2 King. 21, 9, 16. made Iudah to sinne, in doing that which vvas evill in the sight of the Lord, and seduced them to doe more evill then did the nations, vvhom the Lord destroyed before the children of Israell) set a graven image of the groue that he had made, in the house of which the Lord said to David and to Salomon his sonne, In this house and in Ierusalem, which I haue chosen out of al the tribes of Israel, wil I put my name for ever: 2 Kin. 21, 7. 2 Chro. 33, 7. &c. The application hereof we shall shevv hereafter. The Psalmist also speaking of the Chaldeans, saith, O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance, thy holy Temple haue they defiled: they haue layd Ierusalem on heaps. Psal. 79, 1. And Esay speaking of the king of Babylon, saith thus: How art thou fal∣len from heauen, Oor, Day starre. Lucifer, sonne of the morning? how art thou cutte downe to the ground, which didst weaken the nations? For thou hast said in thyne heart, I vvill exalt my throne aboue the starres of God: and I will sit in the mount ofor, testi∣monie, or, appoint∣ment. the Congre∣gation in the sides of the North: I will ascend aboue the heights of the clouds, I will be
like the most High. Esa. 14, 12, 13, 14. Now that by the mount ofor, Church. the congregation at the sides of the North, is meant Mount Sion, on the north side whereof (on mount Moriah) the Temple of Ierusalem vvas built, where also by the Lords appointment, the people of God vvas woont to come together for the vvorship of God: appeareth by this place, compared with Psal. 48, 1, 2. and 78, 68. 2 King. 19, 21, 31. 2 Chron. 3, 1. Esa. 8, 18. and 10, 12. &c. And that thus the Apostles speach aforesaid fitly agreeth herewith, vvho can deny? Ezechiell the Prophet (one of the captiues in Chaldea) speaking of the Temple of God at Ierusalem, and of the estate of the Ievves (the Church and people of God) in his time, saith, The spirit lift me up between the earth & the heauen, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the doore of the inner gate, that looketh toward the North, where vvas the seat of the image of jea∣lousie, which provoketh to jelousie. And behold, the glory of the God of Israell was there, &c. Then said he unto me, Sonne of man, Lift up thine eyes now the way towards the North: so I lift up myne eyes the way toward the North, and behold Northward at the gate of the altar, the image of jealousie in the entry. &c. Ezech. 8, 3, 4, 5. with 1, 1. &c. Where marke again, that Northward at the gate of the altar (of the house and Temple of God) was the seat of this image of Ielousy, or idoll of indignation; another fit type of Antichrist, and of his seat, in the church of God among Christians,or, the God of strōg might of forces, fortresses, munitions, the Al∣mighty God, &c. as this other was in the Temple of God a∣mong the Iewes. Daniel the Prophet speaking of Antiochus Epiphanes, and of his Cap∣taynes and Souldjours, and the Overseers vvhich he set over Ierusalem and Iudah; as also of Iupiters image set in the house of God, &c. (other fit types of Antichrist also) saith thus, And armes shall stand on his part, and they shall polluteor, The Sanctuarie (that is, the Temple of God) and the Muni∣tion (that is Jerusalem being vvell described.) the sanctuarie of strength, and they shall take away the daylyor, wor∣ship. sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate. &c. And the king shall doe according to his will, and he shall2 Thes. 2, 4. exalt himself, and magnifie himself aboue every God, and shall speak marveilous things against the God of Gods, and shall prosper til the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined, shalbe done. Neyther shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any God: but shall magnifie himself aboue all. And as touchingDan. 7, 25. 2 Pet. 2, 18. Rev. 13, 5, 6, 11. the God of strong forts, in his seat he shall honour, yea he shall honourIupiter Olympius. 2. Machab. C. 2. as Pis∣cater & o∣thers ex∣pound t: applying it ao to the breaden God, ho∣noured by the Pope with gold & silver. a God whom his fathers know not, vvith gold, & with silver, and with precious stones, & with pleasant things. &c. Dan. 11, 31, 36, 37, 38. Wherewith also compare Dan. 7, 24, 25. and 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. and 12, 7, 11. with 1 Machab. 1, 23, 39 — 49.50— 53 — 57 — 62. &c. and 2 Machab. 5, 11 — 22. &c. and 6, 1 — 11. &c. 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4, 7 — 12. 1 Tim. 4, 1, 2, 3. 2 Tim. 3 chap. 2 Pet. 2 chap. 1 John 2, 18, 19. Rev. 11, 2, 3. and 12, 1-6.7 — 14. &c. and 13, 5, 6, 7, 11. &c. And especially, this place, 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. Where the Apostles words (noted downe herePag. 124. before) doe so fitly agree vvith that speach of the Prophet Daniels, as they may well be esteemed to haue direct reference thereun∣to: the former being a fit type of this other, in very many things of spe∣ciall vvaight and moment: and for the point in hand very evident and playne, yea such, as by the reference aforesaid doe necessarily evince, that
as the Sanctuarie of Strength, (whereof Daniel speaketh) which was polluted by Antiochus and his instruments; and Gods seat, vvherein the idoll vvas placed and honoured; was the Temple of God at Ierusalem, and so a true Temple; though lamentably profaned and defiled by the meanes afore∣said: so also the Temple (vvhereof Paul speaketh) wherein Antichrist the Man of sinne sitteth, is likevvise the Temple of God; & so a true Temple; though miserably polluted and profaned by Antichrists sitting, and exal∣ting himself therein, as the Apostle speaketh. Where moreover we must stil remember, that the things vvhich hapned to the Ievves for examples; were tipes of things befalling the church under the Gospel, & are vvrittē for our admonitiō, upon whō the ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10, 11. Rom. 15, 4. Heb. 9, 1 — 9 — 24. &c. Ioh. 6, 32, 33. Iude v. 5 — 23. Rev. 2, 14 — 20, &c. So then here, and in the other places before alledged, see how plain & needfull it is, to distinguish betweene the carved image erected by Ma∣nasseh; and the house of God wherein it was set. 2 King. 21, 7. 2 Chron. 33, 7. betvveen the Chaldeans, and the holy Temple, &c. Psal. 79, 1. between Lucifer, the King of Babylon; and the Mount of the Congregation, Mount Sion, vvhere he said he would sit. Esa. 14, 12, 13. betvveen Baals Idol of je∣lousy or indignation; and the Temple of God, in the entry whereof it was set. Ezech. 8, 3, 5. betvveen Antiochus, his Captaynes, Souldjours, Over∣seers, and Idols; and the Sanctuarie, Fortresse, & seat of God, which they polluted and profaned, in vvhich and over vvhich they were set, &c. Dan. 11, 31, 36, 37, 38. &c. And so likevvise between the Man of sinne; and the Temple of God, vvherein he sitteth. 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. Note also herewithall, hovv fitly Iudah in her apostasie and estate, yea the case of Ierusalem and the Temple there, haue typed out unto us the apostasie and estate of the church of Rome. Which I note the rather, be∣cause that this being observed, it will giue great light for the right un∣derstanding of that churches estate, and for the better deciding of many questions thereabout; and doeth also plainly manifest the errour of such as will not admit so much as to haue Israell in her apostasie made a type and patterne thereof, nor to haue reasons and answers deduced and ap∣plied from the one unto the other: whenas the Scripture it self leadeth us euen unto Iudah, as a type and figure thereof, in her apostasy and estate, and yet more particularly also to Ierusalem and the Temple of God. As appeareth evidently and vndeniably, by comparing together the Apo∣stles words, with the Prophet Daniels, 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. vvith Dan. 11, 31.36, 37, 8, &c. besides that which to the same purpose may likevvise be observed out of the other Scriptures here before mentioned, and all such like. 8. To vvhich end, & for the question in hand, obserue also that which Iohn hath in the Revelation, vvhen he saith,Rev. 11.1, 2. And there vvas giuen me a reed ke unto a rod, and the Angell stood saying, Rise, and measure the Temple of God, and he Altar, and them that vvorship therein. But the Court vvhich is vvithout the Temple  leaue out, and measure it not: for it is giuen unto the Gentiles,Gr. cast out. and the holy city shall hey tread upon, tvvo and fourty moneths. Rev. 11, 1, 2. For the better understan∣ding
of which Scripture, we are to remember, that the Temple is diversly spoken of in the Scriptures: sometimes so, as it compriseth the vvhole Temple, vvith all the parts thereof; sometimes but in respect of some parts of it: and that also diversely. For the Scripture sheweth, how there were divers parts thereof: as namely, the holy place, Hebr. 9, 2, 6. Exod. 39, 1. and the most holy place, 1 King. 6, 16, 19. and 8, 6, 8. Hebr. 9, 3, 7. & the courts, 1 King. 7, 12. and 2 King 21, 5. and 23, 12. Psal. 65, 4. and 84, 2. Ezech. 10, 3, 5. and 42, 3. Zach. 3, 7. both the invvard court of the Priests, vvhich vvas next the holy place, and where the Altar of burnt offring stood, Lev. 6, 16.26. 1 King. 6, 36. and 7, 12. 2 Chron. 4, 9. Ezech 10, 3. and 40, 19, 23, 27. and 43, 5. and 44, 17, 21, 27. and 45, 19. and the outward court for the people, which joyned to the court of the Priests, Ezec. 10, 5. and 40, 17, 20, 31. and 42, 1. & 44, 19. 1 Kin 7, 9. 2 Chro. 4, 9. and 23, 5. Esa. 1, 12. and 62, 9. Psa. 84, 2, 10. Jer. 19, 14. and 26, 2. Which outward Court is called the Temple, oftentimes by the Euangelists, vvhere there is mention of Christs preaching, & the peoples being in the Temple Luke 21, 37, 38. and 2, 27, 37. Iohn 18, 20. Also Act. 2, 46. and 3, 1. and 5, 20, 21. and of Christs vvhipping of buyers & sellers out of the Temple, Mat. 21, 12, 13. Joh. 2, 14 — 17. and that none might cary a ves∣sel through the Temple, and other the like. Mar. 11, 15, 16, 17. Where also may be noted, howAriae Montan. Antiq. Iu∣d. Ariel. lib. 5. pag. 92, 93. some write, that (after Salomons first building of the Temple) the peoples Court vvhich at first was but one, being common both for men and vvomen, came in time to be severed with a partition into tvvo: one for the men; and the other for the women: Also, that without the courts aforesaid, there was an other built, vvhich they called CHOL, that is, profane: whereinto the straungers of the Gentiles, that pro∣fessed not the name of Israell, might come for to pray; and the Ievves al∣so that were unclean, & not yet purged according to the rite of the San∣ctuarie. WhichGraser. Plaga Reg. in Apoc. 11. some think is here to be observed, and to be applied hi∣ther for the better understanding of this Scripture. Novv therefore as touching this Scripture (Rev. 11, 1, 2.) vvhether vve understand it more generally, of the Christians and Christian Church, vvith observation of differences among them: as by the measuring of some, and not measuring of other parts thereof, may be considered: or whether yet more specially, we apply the latter clause (of the Court & city) to the outvvard visible estate of the church, and Christians, held by Anti∣christians: so making applicatiō of this last estate to the church of Rome, and the Christians that are likevvise mynded: every vvay it vvill follow that the estate of the said Church and Christians, is to be looked upon & esteemed, according to the estate of the Temple at Ierusalem, and parti∣cularly vvith reference to the Court, and holy city giuen toSo the Ievves for their impi∣etie ar cal∣led the princes of Sodome, & people of Gomoriah Esa. 1, 2, 3, 4-10-12. the Gentiles: and therefore is to be accounted the Church and city of God: as the other vvere his court and city, though polluted, and defiled sundry waies, yea so as the city that had ben faithful, now became an harlot. Esa. 1, 2 — 10— 12 — 21. &c. Ezech. 16, 2 — 35. &c. Dan. 11, 31. &c. Hovv (yet more particularly) to expound and apply, the Temple, the Al∣tar,
the vvorshippers therein, the Court, the holy city, &c. would require a longer discourse: and many haue vvritten vvell thereof in our ovvne tongue, though vvith some difference of interpretation and application thereof. So I shall need to note the lesse thereabout. Thus much therefore one∣ly I doe novv obserue for the present occasion here. That first it be con∣sidered vvhether there be here any mention of the most holy place (unles it be (asM. Bright man on Rev. 11, 1. some think) included in the generall of the Temple of God) or any reference thereunto: because it vvas a type of heauen, as the Apostle plainely teacheth, Heb. 9, 24. whereas here is the description of the estate of Gods church and people on earth. Secondly, whether by the Temple of God, in this place, may not be under∣stood the holy place, and figuratiuely the faithful Christians and more in∣vvard Church of God (so to speak) invisible to men, but seen and preser∣ved by God, that measured and sealed them for his: like as the holy place vvas not open to the people; but vvas for the Priests alone that ministred there before the Lord: And likevvise by the altar, and the vvorshippers in it, to understand the Altar and Priests that offered thereupon, & vvorshipped God in the Sanctuarie and holy place: figuratiuely noting the spirituall vvorship and mediation of Christ, vvith the faithful Christians and vvor∣shippers (made Priests unto God) vvho wholly and onely relye upon Christ, and in his mediation alone present themselues and their wor∣ship unto God: to whom novv they are knowen, though unto men un∣knovven or unregarded. Thirdly, by the Court without the Temple, to understand the Court of the people, calledEzec. 10, 5. 1 King 7, 9, 12. 2 Chro. 4, 9. the outward court, the great Court,Ariae Montan. Antiq. Ju¦daic. lib. 5, pag. 92. the Court of Israel, noting in figure, the visible Church and Christians: (though some Copies also here read it, the Court that is within the Temple, which was the court of the Priests, exempting the court it self from the Altar and worshippers in it, before spo∣ken off, andGraser in Rev: 11, 2. others take it of the outmost court of all, called CHOL, that is, profane, vvhither both the heathen that came to pray, & the Iewes that vvere uncleane might come, as is aforesaid: noting figuratiuely the visible estate of Christians, corrupted sundry wayes, & defiled:) And by the holy city, to understand the city of Ierusalem, notingEzec. 45, 1 — 7. & 48, 8 — 35. in figure, eytherPsa. 122 2, 3, 4. Esa. 1, 21. and 48. 2. Ezec. 42, 20. Mat. 4, 5. the visible church and outward estate of Christians more generally, orEsa. 1, 26 & 52, 1. & 60, 14 21, 22. such as are truly godly, & in deed Gods holy Church more particularly. Fourthly, by the Gentiles, to understand not heathens alone, as Antio∣chus, &c. but the sinfull & rebellious Ievves, called the rulers of Sodome, & people of Gomorrah, Esa. 1, 10. so figuratiuely noting profane and wic∣ked Christians, the Antichristian hierarchie, & Locusts, spoken off Rev. 9, 1 — 11. And by their having of the court giuen unto thē, & their treading of the holy city two and fourty moneths, to understand in one respect, their having & pos∣sessing of the visible face of the Christian church, frequenting, conversing & dominering therein, & in another respect, their afflicting of Gods ho∣ly church and faithfull ones, 1260 yeeres; or the time appointed by God, Rev. 11, 2, 3. WhichM. Bright man on Rev. 11, 2, 3, &c. some think, (taking it in the first sence or respect)
did begin in Constantines time, when the Church came to haue a gene∣rall peace, & freedome from the persecutions whereunto it had ben sub∣ject three hundred yeres before: and did together with the peace, grow sundry waies far more cold & corrupt in religion, thē formerly had ben. Where furthermore and in the verses follovving (among other things) come these particulars to be observed. 1. That the faithfull Christians should be much fevver, then the outvvard professing Christians, vvho grew novv into apostasie deeper and deeper; and so the inner church to be much lesser, then the outvvard visible church of Christians: like as the holy place vvith the Altar, vvas far lesser then the court and city; and the Priests that worshipped vvithin, far fewer then the people that resorted to the Court, and City vvithout. To vvhich purpose also may be obser∣ved in the Prophet Esay, hovv the Ievves professing religion, flocked by heaps to the house of God, bringing a multitude of sacrifices to the Lord, frequenting his Courts and City continually: when as now the daughter of Zion (the faithfull church of the sealed and elect) was left as a cottage in a vineyarde, as a lodge in a Cucumber garden, as a besieged City: so as if the Lord of Hosts had not left them (a feed) a very small remnant, they should haue ben as Sodome and Gomorrah, utterly cut off and de∣stroyed. Esa. 1, 2 — 8 — 12. &c. II. That the foresaid syncere Christians were as it vvere hid (though knovven approved & kept by the Lord) in respect of the outvvard pro∣fessing Christians, that were open and knowen abroad unto men: as the inward parts of the Temple were more hid and secret, in respect of the outward Court and City, that vvere patent to the view and accesse of al. III. That some had entrance & accesse into the more invvard church (so to call it) through the way and estate of the outvvard and visible Church: thoughNote this also for ba∣ptisme the sacrament of entrance into the church, had in times of apostasie. now held and frequented by the Hierarchie and Chri∣stians in apostasie: like as the entrance and passage into the more inward parts of the Temple, was through the City and Court that was vvithout, though now giuen to the Gentiles, the Iew Princes and people of So∣dome and Gomorrah, and by them trode upon, as is aforesaid. IIII. That as among the Ievves,Psal. 59, 3, 4, 5. & 54, 3, 5. with Esa. 1 2 — 10. &c such as were tretcherous, apostate, persecuting, strong & prevayling outwardly, were of old called Gentiles or heathens: so now among the Christians, such also as are tretcherous, apo∣state, persecuting, mighty, and outvvardly prevayling, are likewise here called heathens, or Gentiles. V. That God in this estate stirred up among and against them, his witnesses, few, yet sufficient, seeing they are tvvo: and are also strengthned, sanctified, directed, preserved, heard, and blessed of the Lord: as wereRev. 11, 4 with Zac. 3, & 4 ch. Ioshua and Zerubbabel, tvvo Oliue trees, and two can∣dlesticks (in one respect)Rev. 11.5 6. with Ex. 7, 19. &c. Numb. 16, 15, &c. Moses and Aaron,1 Kin. 17 1. & 18, & 19, 9 — 17. & 21.17, 18 — 24. 1 King 1, 10, 12, 17. and 2, 9, 23, 24. & 3. & 5, & 6, & 7, & 8, & 9, & 13, 14 — 21 Luk. 4, 24, 25, 26, 27. Rom. 11, 1 — 5. Jam. 5, 17, 18. Eliah and Elisha (in other respects) to vvhom here may reference be made: or (asM. For∣bis on Rev. 11, s. 3. some think) also to the faythful witnesses of the trueth that were among the Iewes, when Antiochus persecuted them, and profaned the Temple and vvorship of
God. Dan. 7, 8, 25, and 8, 9 — 14. and 11, 31 — 39. and 12, 7, 10.This also is fitly appli∣ed to the old and New Te∣stamēt. &c by M. Bright. Na¦peir, &c. VI. ThatRev. 11, 7 — 12. with 14, 9 — 12. and Col. 2, 5. these vvitnesses being stayn by the beast (the Antichristian hierarchie and Locusts aforesaid) and their corps lying unburied in the street of the great city Babylon, spiritually called Sodome & Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified, and thus beheld of the people and nations, to the great rejoycing of them that dvvell on the earth: yet then after∣vvard at the time appointed; they stand upon their feet againe, being re∣vived by the power & spirit of God (asLuk. 1, 13 — 17. with Mal. 4, 5. Matt. 11, 14. and 17, 10— 13. Iohn Baptist in spirit & povver was Elias, &Ezec. 37. 1 — 10. the dead bones in Ezechiel vvere revived, and stood up on their feet againe; & asGen. 4, 25 God gaue Sheth to Eue, another seed in stead of Abell, vvhom Cain slevv) and so are called up into heauen, being novv by the favour and power of God freed from the earth of Antichrists aposta∣sie, & separated from communiō therewith, to enjoy the heauenly estate and benefit of the faith and order of Christ, wherein the churches at first were set by the Apostles. VII. Where note, that by heauen (in this book of the Revelat.) is often meant the more syncere, intire and heauenly estate of the church, for the faith, vvorship, and order thereof; and by the Earth, the degenerate, cor∣rupt, and earthly estate thereof in apostasie: Also, that as by degrees the church did degenerate, and not all at once; so also the restauration there∣of, is not all performed at once, but proceeds on by degrees: as we may obserue a different condition of these witnesses themselues, in their first testimonie, and in their revived estate: and aftervvard again (in the 14 chap. which may be a further explication of this) the Angels, there spoken off,Rev. 14, 6, 8, 9. & proceed still one of them further then another: andv. 9, &c. the third cal∣leth more directly and earnestly for separation, and utter leaving of the Beast, his worship and marks, then did the first and second; and then af∣terward the other Angels there spoken of, are said to come one of them,ver. 15. out of the Temple; and another,ver. 17. out of the Temple which is in heauen: the Scripture thus shewing, how the trueth is manifested and proceedeth on by degrees, and hovv the faithfull are brought by the Gospell from yeel∣ding homage unto the Hierarchie of Antichrist, and grovv up more and more to haue the Temple in heauen, the Church in her heauenly, open, and syncere estate, as it was before the earthly corruptions & apostasie grew upon it. VIII. That the event of things performed accordingly, may the more confirme us, that liue in this age, hereabout: inasmuch as now we know, thatGuiliel. de Sancto amo re. Marci∣lius Patuvi∣us. Dantes. Fracisc. Pe∣trarcha. Eckhardu John Wic∣leff. &c. the former Angels and vvitnesses of old (though godly men and Martyrs, yet) continued themselues (many of them) in the apostate church of Rome, and other churches, that were corrupted with the like apostasy: preaching the Gospell unto & among them, calling them from idolatrie, denouncing the fall of Babylon, &c. vvhereas theLuther. Viret, Cal∣vin, Lati∣mer, &c. latter Angels & vvit∣nesses that follovved after, called others, and vvere called themselues, to separate from that estate, and to returne to the auncient faith and vvay, wherein the churches were set of old. Which also hath ben, & yet is per∣formed
by degrees: As vve find that Luther, Calvin, Latimer, Bradford, & the godly vvith them, vvent further, then John Wickliff, John Hus, Jerome of Prage, and others before them. Also that the Church of England goeth further in many things then the Lutherans. And that the other reformed chur∣ches proceed further then the church of England: though yet al the cor∣ruptions of the apostasie, be not vvholly taken avvay, and the churches brought to that heauenly synceritie, wherein they vvere planted by the Apostles at the first: vvhereunto vve ought all earnestly to striue, what in us is: knovving that this estate is not atteyned all at once; and that those churches which are most freed from the corruptions aforesaid, & come nearest to the auncient integrity of the vvay of God, are the most parta∣kers of this grace and heauenly blessing of the Lord. IX. That furthermore by the consideration of the Temple, with the seve∣rall parts, places and uses thereof, we may obserue a double consideration of the estate, and communion of the Church and people of God: The one here on earth, the other in heauen. And that vvhich is on earth, to be also tvvo fould: the one outward and visible, the other more invisible and in∣ward. The outvvard and visible, signified by the Court of the Temple, vvhich was outward, vvhither all Israell came, noting the churches outward estate and communion vvith God, in the visible assemblies thereof. The inward and invisible, signified by the sanctuarie and holy place, which were in∣ward, whither the Priests onely had accesse: noting the more invisible estate and communion vvhich the elect and faithfull haue vvith God in spirit and trueth, being made Priests unto God in Iesus Christ. And lastly, the estate & cōmunion had vvith God in heauen, signified by the most ho∣ly place, where God dwelt between the Cherubims,Hebr. 9, 7 — 24. whither onely the high Priest came once a yere, not vvithout blood:Exo. 28.6 — 29. carying on his brest and shoul∣ders the names of the tribes of Israell graved in precious stones, and so presented them before the Lord: notingHebr. 3, 1. and 9, 24. and 10 19, 20, 21. Ioh. 14, 2, 3. our accesse to God in heauen, by Iesus Christ the high Priest of our profession, who appeareth before God for us, & hath many mansions prepared in heauen for us, that where he is, there may we be also. X. Finally, that as they vvhich vvent into the inner parts of the Tem∣ple, did passe (as I noted before) through the outvvard Court: and yet not all that come to the outvvard Court, did or might passe to the places of the Temple that were more inward:Sal. Song. 1, 7, 8. Act. 2, 47. so they that vvould be partakers of Gods heauenly favours and blessings here and for ever, should (what in them is) use the meanes and benefit of the outvvard estate and com∣munion of the Church of God on earth: and yet also not all vvho enjoy the benefit of the churches visible estate, are partakers of the invisible graces and eternall salvation of God: but onely the elect and those that are truely godly. Yea that the outvvard Court, and City to be troden upon, is subject to be giuen unto apostates and persecuters, & that for a long time together: vvhen yet all this time the elect and faithfull passing through these to vvithin, being sanctified and approved of God, are still
preserved, and protected by him: and in the end, are called from earth up into heauen. These novv are the things vvhich I thought here to note by this occa∣sion. Which are likewise (for the most of them) observed and acknow∣ledged by the best of the Protestant vvriters generally. Yea also some of these men themselues (vvith vvhom we haue to deale) do thus understand and apply that vvhich is here spoken of the Court and holy City, as in their ovvne vvritings may be seen. And because the point is of waight, for the matter in hand, I vvill here therefore (before I proceed further) note downe their owne words; wishing the Reader vvell to obserue them: as follovveth. When M. Sm. in a treatise of his, wrote thus,M. Sm. diffe. p. 20. and 21. As the holy place with the Altar and Priests did properly signify the Church, worship, and Saints, (Rev. 11, 1. 1 Pet. 2, 5.) under the nevv testament: so the court without the holy place whither al the people came, and the typicall service performed there, did signify the confused assemblies of Antichristian persecuters, and their ceremoniall worship, Rev. 11, 2. which the spirit in that place calleth Gentiles or heathen in those respects: M. Ainsw. answering him, after he had shewed some misconceits of his about the Tabernacle and things perteyning thereunto, proceedeth then further in his answer on this sort, saying:M. Ain. defence of Script. p. 12 13, 14, 15. His eye sight fayled not so much in the shadovv, as his heart vvas blynded in the shadowed thing. For he maketh [the tabernacle, altar, and Priests,] to signifie [the church, worship and Saints] under the new Testament: [the court of the Taberna∣cle] he will haue to signifie the assemblies of Antichrist: [the Israelites there assembling,] to si∣gnifie the Antichristian persecurers: &c. Behold unto what great iniquity he abuseth the word of God.Note how M. A. speak∣eth of Isra∣el here. The body of the Church of Israell,Exo. 4, 22 the son and first borne of the Lord,Psal. 135 4. his chosen and chief treasure,Deu. 7, 6, 7. precious unto him aboue all peoples of the earth, on vvhom he set his loue,Deu. 33.26. riding upon the heauens for their help, and on the clouds in his glory, a peoplevers. 29. blessed & sa∣ved by the Lord, the shield of their help and sword of their glorie: this people he maketh to si∣gnifie the Antichristian persecuters, hated of God, children of the Divel, for whose overthrow & confusion ChristRev. 19, 11 — 21. rideth on the heauens in his glory with a garment dipt in blood, and a sword for to slay them, and fill all the foules of the ayer vvith their flesh. &c. The LordsLev. 6, 16 holy Courts, wherein they that dweltPsa. 65, 4 were blessed, for which the soules of the SainctsPsal. 84.2, 10. longed and fainted, counting one day there better then a thousand othervvhere: is now made to signify the Synagogue of Sathan, and place vvhere the Divell dwelleth. &c But what may we thin induced M. Sm. to this impietie? Euen Satan deceived him by one place of Scripture, whichPag. 21. he citeth in his book, viz, Rev. 11.2. where Iohn was willed in a vision to [cast out the Court vvhich is without the temple, & not measure it, for it is giuen to the Gen∣tiles.] Hence doeth M. Sm. gather that the Israelites which were woont to worship in the courts of the Lord did signifie the Gentiles, that is the Antichristians, and consequently the court must betoken Antichrists church, and the vvorship Antichrists worship. Thus one darke Scripture is alledged to overthrow the cleare doctrine that shineth throughout all the Prophets. Yet euen this place it self mought haue taught him better. For first the commandementRev. 11, 1. to measure the Temple, Altar, and worshippers, signified the restoring or repayring of Gods church and people, after some destruction and desolation: as the like visions shewedEzec. 40, 3, 5. Zach. 2, 1, 2. to Ezekiell and Zacharie, after the destruction of Salomons temple, doe manifest. Secondly, whenas [the Court and holy City] was not measured here by Iohn, as before byEzec. 40, 47. & 48, 30. Zach. 2, 2. the other Prophets they were, and as afterwardRev. 21, 15. Iohn did see: it may teach us that as yet there was not a full restauration of Gods church and worship, from the defection of Antichrist. Thirdly, in that the court is here said to be [Rev. 11, 2 giuen to the Gentiles, and the holy city] should be troden under foot of them, and a time limited how long, [two and fourty moneths,] this ar∣gueth that the court was not made, nor the city builded for them: but by Gods permission, for e chastisement of men, was giuen unto them for a season, during vvhich time his [two witnes∣ses] should prophecy against them. And thus it is said of the figure, the first temple & city,Ier. 12, 7 I
haue giuen] the dearly beloved of my soule into the hands of her enemies. So all Iudah [Jer. 20, 4 was giuen] into the hand of the king of Babell: andEsa. 63, 18. Esaias complaineth how the adversaries had [troden downe] Gods sanctuarie, as here [Rev. 11, 2. they tread downe] the holy city. And if [the court of the Temple] must needs signifie Antichrists court, because it was giuen to the Gentiles, then must [the holy city] by which nameNeh. 11, 1. Esa. 48.2 and 52, 1. Matt. 4, 5. Ierusalem is often called, signifie also Antichrists city & church, because it was troden downe of the same Gentiles: but all the Prophets shewPsal. 51, 18. & 87. and 122. Esa. 60. Rev. 21. that it signified the Church of God. M. Ainsw. defence of Script. p. 12 — 15. Hitherto are M. Ainsworths vvords (when he wrote for the trueth) a∣gainst M. Smith, vvhom he sharpely blameth for teaching that the Court without the Temple did signify Antichrists Court or assemblies: and for that he vvould make the Lords Courts to signifie the Synagouue of Sathan, and place where Sathan dwelleth, &c. whereas novv himself writing another treatise synce (against the trueth) taketh up M. Sm. termes, and manner of exposition, to teach that the Temple of God (spoken off by the Apostle, 2 Thes. 2, 4.) isAnimad. p. 78, &c. Anti∣christs Church;Note this vvell. Antichrists Temple; Antichrists body; an idoll like Antichrist himself; the Synagogue of Sathan; such as is no more the Temple of God,Ibid. pa. 94, &c. then the di∣vel, which appeared to the witch at Endor, was Samuel; such as the type thereof should be set (not from the Temple of God at Ierusalem, but) from Bels Temple in Babylon, or the Samaritanes Temple builded by Sanballat &c. Would any think, that this were M. Ainsw. his writing or opinion, that had written so ear∣nestly and with so sharp reproofs against M. Smith before, if he had not set his ovvne name thereunto? Or may it not be thought, if M. Sm. were aliue, and savv this latter treatise of M. Ainsw. that he would now turne his ovvne speaches and reproofs upon himself, where he saith, that his eye fight fayled him and his heart was blynded, that he abused the Scripture to great impie∣ty; that Sathan deceived him; that the place it self mought haue taught him better; &c. But of this, more hereafter. Now for the present it shall suffice, touching the point in hand, to ob∣serue hovv by M. Ainsw. his ovvne graunt, the Church of God is signifyed both by the court of the Temple, though unmeasured, and giuen to the Gen∣tiles; and by the holy city, though troden dovvn also of the same Gentiles. Rev. 11, 2. And this moreover to agree with the doctrine of al the Prophets. Novv vve know that the Prophets and Apostles are not caryed about vvith everie vvynde: They are not as reeds shaken hither and thi∣ther: but their doctrine is firme, and abideth the same for ever. So as if this vvas the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, when M. A. vvrote against M. Sm. (as here himself saith:) then there is no question but it is so still. And so let it still remaine. For the further declaration whereof, & better exposition of this Scri∣pture, let us also compare herevvith, that which is written in the Prophet Esay, vvhere the Lord saith, I haue nourished and brought up children, and they haue rebelled against me. The oxe knovveth his ovvner, and the asse his masters cribibut Israell doeth not knovv, my people doth not consider. Ah sinfull nation, a people la∣den vvith iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that are corrupters: they haue forsaken the Lord, they haue provoked the Holy one of Israell to anger, they are gone avvay backvvard, &c. Heare the vvord of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodome, giue eare unto the
Lavv of our God, ye people of Gomorrah. To vvhat purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me, saith the Lord? When ye comeHeb. to be seen. to appeare before me, vvho hath re∣quired this at your hand, to tread my Courts? Hovv is the faithfull city become an harlot? &c. Where obserue first, vvhat a fit reference there is betvveen the perfidious Ievves, here called the rulers of Sodome and people of Gomorrah; and betvveen the insolent Christians, called (in the Revelation) the Gentiles. Secondly, how the very like phrase of treading the Courts of God, is used by the Prophet (as is in the other place by the Apostle, of treading the holy city, Rev. 11, 2.) and may here signify (besides a treading downe or under foot) a frequent and continuall conversing in the outward and visible Church of God with their bodies, though their hearts vvere far removed from God, and they served not the Lord syncerely according to his word. Esa. 1, 12 — 15. vvith 29, 13, 14. Thirdly, that the Princes and people of Iudah thus transgressing, & the faithful city (of Ierusalem) becomming an har∣lot: yet they are still the people of God, and the Lord is their God, and the Courts and city are the Lords. Other things that might here be observed, I omit. And for the terme of the Gentiles used by the Apostle, that by it we may understand, not the heathen, but Christians being apostates, vvicked, & mighty persecuters, outwardly prevayling &c. may appeare (as I noted here before) not onely by the like speach of this Prophet, but of others al∣so, where the Israelites (circumcised, & members of the church of God, of the outward visible Church of Israell) are likewise called heathens, in re∣gard of their perfidiousnes, iniquity, strength, persecution, prevailing out∣vvardly, &c. Psal. 59, 5. compared vvith the title of the Psalme. Which is also observed by M. Ains. in his Annot. both on Psal. 59, 1, 6. and on Exod. 12, 43. though in his opposition of us, he forget both it and himself. The like he observeth also upon the vvordM. Ain. annotat. on Psal. 54, 2, 5. and 59, 1, 6. Exod. 12, 43. straungers, which is applied by David to the Ziphims, vvho vvere of the tribe of Iudah, Psal. 54, 3. and to Apostate Israelites, by the Chaldee Paraphrast, as he noteth on Exod. 12, 43. So as in this matter I need bring no other testimonie, but his ovvn expo∣sition of the Scripture othervvhere, vvhen he dealeth syncerely therein, vvithout any perverting thereof, or shifting & cavilling thereabout. But hovv ever he deale, it is evident and sufficient, that the Iewes who vvere the people of God, and so acknovvledged by the Prophets, are by them also termed the Princes of Sodome, and people of Gomorrah, Esa. 1, 3, 10. and 3, 9, 12, 15. Jer. 23, 13, 14, 22, 27, 32. Ezec. 16, 3, 46 — 56. vvith 13, 9, 10, 18, 19. &c. And many other the like in the Scriptures: that we need not think it strange to haue the termes of Gentiles, of Sodome, and the like, applied to Christians like∣wise upon just occasions: as in this place, Rev. 11, 2. &c. Herewith also we may compare Ezec. 34, 17, 18, 19. and that vvhich is written in the prophe∣cy of Daniel: hovv the litle horne (Antiochus, a type of Antichrist) waxed great toward the pleasant land (of Iudea) euen to the host of heauen (the Church of God among the Iewes) and cast downe some of the host, and of the starres to the ground, and stamped upon them; yea magnified himself euen to the Prince of the host (the Lord God himself) and that by him the dayly sacrifice (figuring out Christ, and ju∣stification
by faith in him) was taken avvay,Antiochus also com∣māded the Jevves to sacrifice swines flesh & unclean beasts, & to eat also therof, &c 1 Mach. 1, 47.48, & 2 Mach. 6, 18. & 7, ch. A type of Anti∣christs en∣joyning of will wor∣ship; teach∣ing of Iusti¦fication by works: wal¦king in un∣clean con∣versation, &c. and the place of his Sanctuarie cast dovvne; and the host (of Gods people) giuen over for the transgression against the dayly sacrifice; and that he cast dovvne the trueth (the doctrine of Gods Law touching his vvorship, and the vvorship it self) to the ground; having both the Sanctuarie, & the host giuen to be troden under foot, & polluted, for many dayes. Dan. 8, 9 — 14. and 11, 31. &c. Where though the Sanctuarie and host were thus giuen to be troden under foot and polluted, &c. yet were they still the Temple, church and people of God notvvithstanding. To conclude therefore, it may appeare likewiseRev. 11, 2. by this Scripture, (vvhich speaketh thus of the Court giuen unto the Gentiles, &c.) hovv we may esteem of the church of Rome, & the like churches, to be in the outvvard visible estate thereof, the Court novv giuen to the Gentiles (to the hierar∣chie of Antichrist, the vvicked, profane, revolting, mightie, & persecuting Christians,) Rev. 11, 2. and so likewise to be the Temple of God, where∣in the Man of sinne sitteth as God, &c. 2 Thes 2, 3, 4. and consequently, that fit reference may be made between thē & the estate of the Church of Iu∣dah in sundry respects: so as if Iudah and the Sanctuarie was then the Church and Temple of God (vvhich our opposites themselues wil not de∣ny) then the same in like sort must needs be yeelded also to the church of Rome, and other churches in such estate. 9. Which is yet the more evident, if vve obserue that in the church of Rome, there are the Lords posts and thresholds mixed vvith their owne, as was in Iudah and Ierusalem of old. Ezec. 43, 7, 8, 9. Rev. 11, 2. and 2 Thes. 2, 4. Which how ever some blush not to deny, yet euen experience it self sheweth both the thing it self to be true and undeniable, and such asser∣tions to be notoriously false, and extreemly injurious against the vvork of Gods grace and power, who hath preserved sundry trueths and ordi∣nances of his among them, albeit them selues haue commingled there∣vvith their ovvn notable errors & superstitions. As namely, the doctrine of one God, and three persons; the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost; & of the Sonne of God made man, professing and vvitnessing to death, that Iesus is the Christ the Sonne of God; the doctrine also of the Creation of the world, made of nothing by the word of God; of the Redemption of the vvorld by Jesus Christ; of the Resurrecti∣on of the body, and Immortality of the soule; together with the other grounds of Christian faith, that are conteined in the Articles, commonly called the Apostles Creed, the Nicene Creed, Athanasius Creed, &c. Also the Lords ordinance of Baptisme: though commingled vvith their owne superstitions; as the doctrines aforesaid likewise be vvith sundry errors and corruptions of their ovvne. Besides that such as haue and re∣teyne the Baptisme there had, may lavvfully and comfortably eat at the Lords table: Which othervvise such could not doe, seeing they that haue not the Lords Baptisme, may not eat of the Lords Supper; but should profane it, if they doe Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. compared with Exod. 12, 43, 45, 48. & Mal. 1, 7, 8. Moreover, the termes of the Temple of God, & of the Court of the Temple, are
by the Apostles ascribed to that, and the like Christian churches, and people. 2 Thes. 2, 4. Rev. 11, 2. And the people of God, which are called and come out of Babylon, need not a nevv plantation of a church, but a refor∣mation onely. In which respect, the tearme of the Reformed Churches, is very fit and godly, and the proceeding accordingly: Whereas the course and dealing of the Anabaptists, and all such, as eyther begin all a new, or averre such assertions as doe necessarily imply it, is not onely preposte∣rous, but excedingly sinfull and erroneous. Rev. 7, and 11, and 14, chapters, with 18, 4. and Esa. 48, 20. Ier. 50, 8. and 51, 45, 50. 2 Chron. 29, 5 — 17. 2 Thes. 2, 4. 2 Pet. 2, 1, 2. &c. and 3, 1, 2. &c. Iude. ver. 3, &c. Finally, if the former assertions were true, and that there were not any of Gods posts, thresholds, or ordinances at all left in that church: then would it follovv on the one hand, that the apostasie of the man of sinne were not a mysterie of iniquitie (as the Apostle calleth it) but that all might easily discerne and avoyde it: and on the other hand, that none of that church, synce the apostasie aforesaid, should be saved. Which apostasie, some begin tvvo hundred yeres after Christ, some three hundred yeres (in Constan∣tines time) some four, some fiue, some sixe hundred yeres after Christ: & the Apostle Paul saith, the mysterie of that iniquity wrought already, in his dayes. 2 Thes, 2, 7. Whereupon, vvhat consequences vvould follovv, if the asserti∣ons aforesaid vvere true, such as are of heart & understanding vvill easily perceiue. Difference therefore (as I haue noted before) is to be observed & put betvveen the church, and the apostasie thereof; betvveen the house of God, and the pollutions thereof; between the Lords posts & thresholds, and mans inventions and superstitions commingled therevvith; between the trueths and ordinances of God that still are kept, and the errors and corruptions of men that are brought in and reteyned vvithall; betvveen the Temple of God, and Antichrists sitting therein; betvveen the Court and holy City, and the Gentiles to vvhom they are giuen to tread upon, for the time appointed, &c. In regard of vvhich difference, divers things are accordingly spoken, and different phrases used in the Scriptures, & in the speaches and vvritings of men. Which vvhiles many doe not obserue or regard, vvhereas they think to hold the trueth firmely, they run into errour upon errour extreemely. 10. Lastly, as in Israel and Iudah, when they fel into apostasie, they cea∣sed not presently to be the church and people of God, neyther did the Lord forthwith cast them off and giue them a bill of divorce, but did a∣gain and again, time after time, plead vvith them, call them to repentance, and convince them by his Prophets and servants, besides his avvakening of them by sundry corrections and punishments: so should we likevvise obserue about the Church of Rome, and the like: which haue for a long time layd (as it vvere) lulled a sleep in securitie: whom the Lord notwith∣standing hath by his witnesses and servants from time to time, & of late (synce Luthers time) more earnestly and many wayes set to avvaken, &
to plead against them, calling them to repentance, and convincing them dayly more and more. Which work the Lord vvill not slack, but wil still follovv on and prosecute, till he haue in all things accomplished it, accor∣ding to his ovvne purpose, to the praise both of his mercy and justice, in the end. In the mean time, vvhiles the Lord is pleading with that church, discovering more & more the apostasie & iniquitie thereof by the light of his vvord, and testimonie of his servants: vve should not deny it to be the church and Temple of God, though Antichrist sit therein, and misera∣bly pollute it: but because so it is, we should therefore the more careful∣ly set our selues to plead the Lords cause vvith it, against the apostasie thereof, and in all things (vvhat lyeth in us) to discover the iniquity of the Man of sinne, (the Beast, the Antichrist) that is set therein: untill the Lord haue consumed that lawles one, & powred out the vial of his wrath upon the Beasts throne, &c. fully performing his work upon the mysticall Babylon, as he hath severely denounced, and expressely foretold, 2 Thes. 2, 3 — 8. with Rev. 11, 2, 3. and 16, 10, 11. and 17, and 18 chap. &c. and as he per∣formed his work on the Chaldean Babylon heretofore. Jer. 50, and 51. Where obserue, that the Scripture in these places speaketh not of Gods Temple, Court, City or church to be destroyed; but of the Man of sinne, to be the sonne of perdition; of the lavvlesse one to be consumed and abolished, 2 Thes. 2, 3, 8. of the viall of Gods vvrath to be powred on the Beasts throne, Rev. 16, 10. of the Beast to goe into perdition, Rev. 17, 11. of the great City Babylon, to be burnt vvith fier, and to be throvvn downe, that she shall no more at all be found; Rev. 18, 8, 20, 21. (with resemblance to the former Babylon of Chaldea, Jer. 51, 61 — 64.) Yea also that euen at this time, and in this chapter, vvhere he speaketh of the burning and ut∣ter destroying of Babylon, yet here nowEusebius also writes that God called the people of the church of Jerusa∣lem, out frō thence be∣fore the de¦struction of the cyty. Eccles. hist. l. 3 c. 5. he calleth his people out from thence: as he did before out of Babylon of old. Rev. 18, 4. with Ier. 51, 45. Which shevveth that God yet still hath his people there: and that he put∣teth difference between them, and the City of Babylon it self. Note here also, how some of this age (who haue observed many worthy things out of this book) think, that our dayes are but come to the time of the fourth Angels powring out of his viall upon the Sonne, &c. Rev. 16, 8, 9. And tou∣ching the Beasts Throne it self, that the fift Angels powring out of his viall thereon, is yet to come: understanding also thereby, the City of Rome, that shall haueForwhich also note Rev. 18.8, 9, 15, 18, 1. &c. some sore outvvard calamity fall upon it, to the finall destruction thereof, &c. And then addeth this moreover, saying: Let us obserue from hence for our lear∣ning, hovv long suffring and slow to anger God is; he hath convinced this whore of her foul and shameful tricks a thousand times before. But yet he vvil not overthrow her ut∣terly, before he haue placed her sinnes in a more cleare Sun-shine, then ever they saw yet. Which seeing it hath ben and shall also be in vain, what remaineth, but her finall doome of destruction to punish her with, whenas she is past hope of any amendment. M. Bright∣man on Rev. 16, 8, 9, 10, &c. To vvhich purpose may also be observed, that there it is said, they repented not of their deeds: shewing that by the vials and plagues there spoken off, they should yet haue ben brought to
repentance, vvhich they vvere not. Revel. 16, 10, 11. Furthermore, all doe acknowledge (as I noted before, upon like occa∣sion) that if any church haue to deale vvith a particular person that hath sinned, they doe and ought to hold him a member (though in sinne) all the time that they are pleading and dealing with him: untill that obsti∣nacy being joyned to his other sinnes, he be cast out and cut off from the church. Hovv much more should this be yeelded to vvhole churches, all the time that the Lord is pleading vvith them: as vve see that Israell and Iudah vvas dealt withall, by the Prophets from time to time, yea and af∣terward by Christ himself and his Apostles. Finally it vvere a very good thing (considering the manifold objecti∣ons hereabout) that these men would shevv the time, when the churches aforesaid vvere by the Lord put from under his covenant, and had a bill of divorce giuen unto them &c. Which how it is urged by the Papists themselues concerning the church of Rome (and ought a thousand fold more to be urged in behalf of the church of England) vvho can be igno∣rant? The Lord himself (who is the husband & Lord of his church) hath the povver, and knoweth his owne purpose, time & meanes, for the disa∣nulling of churches, removing of his Candlesticks, giving his bill of di∣vorce, &c. Which, when and as it pleaseth him to reveale it by his word, is by all religiously to be regarded. Otherwise there are no mens say∣ings (though never so peremptorie) that can carry away such matters. It is onely the Word and vvork of God, that herein is to be observed & re∣lyed upon. And thus much concerning these objections. CHAPTER IIII. Replies & Answers concerning Churches in apostasie, and the church of Rome, more particularly. &c. NOvv moreover, seing that by this occasion we treat both of this matter, and of the Scriptures aforesaid: whereabout there hath ben and still is so very great opposition made: it is needfull, and (be∣ing thus provoked) I am not unvvilling, for the better fynding out and clearing of the trueth in this behalf, somevvhat more to insist hereupon. For although their errors and evasions, abuse of Scriptures, & other ab∣surdities, vvho deny or labour to obscure these things (what they can) are so very many, as every page, yea almost every sentence aboundeth there∣vvith; and withall so very shifting & frivolous, as in them selues they are not worth the naming, much lesse vvorth the refuting: yet considering that many in simplicity or othervvise (& some not of the worst disposed) are greatly overcaried hereabout, whether by prejudice of the matter it self, or by admiration of the mens persons that oppose, or by some other sinister respect, themselues know best: I haue therefore thought it
good here to giue the Reader some tast of the Opposites dealing in this behalf: that so they may set themselues more unpartially to consider of these things, and more soundly to judge thereof, according to the word of God. Now then, whereas concerning this question, there had ben speach & vvriting, and my self (in answer thereof) had written thusIn answer of M. A. letter, as may be set in M. Cht. Advertis. p. 58, 59. As touching the Church of Rome, there being speach about it to be the church of God, I did alledge the saying of the Apostle, that Antichrist should sit in the Temple of God, as the Apostle expressely teacheth, 2 Thes. 2, 4. And by the Temple of God, understanding the church of God, it will follovv that Antichrist should sit in the church of God: and is there to be sought and found: and not among the Jevves, Turks, Pagans or the like, as the Papists and others would perswade us: neyther that Antichrist takes away vvholy the church of God, and every trueth and ordinance of the Lord, as Anabaptists, and such as are herein Anabaptistically inclined vvould beare us in hand: Thereup∣on one of these Opposites replying, first of all layeth this for a ground, thatM. Ain. Amad. p. 76. the church of Rome is acknovvledged by all that fear God to be the throne of Antichrist. I ansvver, First, if it vvere so, that all would say this, as here is set downe: yet we would hear, Thus saith the Lord. Secondly, although that this being but generally spoken, and in a good understanding, might be admitted: yet when men doe so speak and understand it, as therevvithall to imply or infer, that the church of Rome is not the Temple and church of God, we must take heed hovv we admitte it, considering vvhat conse∣quences follow thereupon, for the upholding of Anabaptistrie and other erroneous opinions thereabout: and seeing also the Scripture teacheth that the Beasts throne in deed is that, vvhich was theRev. 13, 2. Dragons throne, and was by the Dragon giuen unto him (which this man himself acknovvledgethPag. 79. here a litle after, & applieth unto Antichrist.) & isRev. 17, 9, 10, 18. that great city, which (in Iohns time reigned over the kings of the earth; which is built on seuen h; and had seuen kings or kinds of regiment, vvhereof fine were fallen, when Iohn wrote, &c. which particulars, vvith other the like, are al found to be thus in the city (not in the church) of Rome. Of vvhich point I shall haue occasion to speak more hereafter. Besides thatM. Bright mā on Rev. 13, 2. and 16, 10. and 17 ch. &c. good writers also, and men fearing God, understand the Scriptures here alledged, to speak of the city of Rome. Thirdly, it is also rue, that Antichrist sitteth in the Temple of God, and so in the church of Rome, and polluteth it, as Antio∣chus did Gods Temple at Ierusalem: Yet his sitting in Gods Temple, makes not it to be his throne. 2 Thes. 2, 4. Lucifer (the king of Babylon) boasted of his sitting in the mount of the Congregation, on the sides of the North, meaning the Temple of God at Ierusalem. Yet Babylon vvas his throne, & not the Temple on mount Sion. Esa. 14.12, 13. The Dragon is in heauen, yet heauen is not his throne. Rev. 12, 3. In the dayes of Manasseh, Zede∣chiah, Antiochus, and others, there vvere idols of sundry sorts set in the Temple of God at Ierusalem: Yet was not Gods Sanctuarie therefore the throne of idols: but it vvas still Gods house, and Gods seat, though thus polluted: and was so called and acknowledged by the Prophets notwith∣standing.
2 King. 21, 7. Ezec. 8, 3, 5. vvith ver. 14, and 16. Dan. 11, 31, 38. In deed the church of Rome (properly taken) being in the city of Rome, men may mistake, or be mistaken; and may the more be borne vvithall, and such speaches better be admitted, when things are not yet called in question: and when men in simplicity speak generally (as I said) and not by way of opposition, carping, cavilling, reviling, oppugning, &c. as also if by such speaches men simply mean, that Antichrist sitteth in the church of Rome, and yet deny it not therefore to be the church and Temple of God not∣vvithstanding. Another ground he would take frō some vvords of mine, that I wrote heretofore, viz.In answe to M. Ja∣cob pref. sect. 6 that the hierarchie and church constitution of Antichrist is the most detestable annarchie of Satan that ever was. And then also I vvished the Reader (as still I doe)Ibid. sec 1. to try what I vvrite by the word of God: and as it agreeth there∣vvith so to receiue it, and no further nor otherwise. So let this be my answer (once for all) touching any thing objected that I haue vvritten about this, or a∣ny other matter. Secondly, I doe still professe, that the hierarchie of An∣tichrist, both is of Sathan, & is an apostasie most detestable. But this now further vvithall, that popular anarchie also is most sinfull and miserable. They are both of them extreems, and religiously to be avoyded. The middle vvay is the right vvay, namely, Gods ordinance of the Eldership, vvhich should carefully be kept intire, against all usurpation both of the Prelacy of the one hand, and of the people on the other. Thirdly, I doe now obserue (more, and in some things othervvise then before) a diffe∣rence between the churches constitution, & the hierarchie of Antichrist, brought in upon it: also, betvveen Antichrist vvith his hierarchie (where∣about our question is not) and the Temple or church of God, vvherein he sitteth: whereabout our question is; & whereunto this man keepeth not. Of which more hereafter: besides that vvhich hath ben spoken therea∣bout already. His reproachfull speaches here and throughout his book, I leaue upon his ovvne head. And now I come unto his ansvver, which next follovveth. Where first he answereth, that in the former allegation of 2 Thes. 2, 4. & the reason deduced from thence, truth and error are closely cowched together. But he telleth not vvhat he acknovvledgeth for truth, and what he taketh to be error. If so he had done, it may be he would haue ben found eyther to acknowledge the trueth, vvhich novv he sets himself to oppugne, or that his ovvne errors vvould the sooner and better haue appeared, which he vvould novv covvch and cary avvay as closely as he can. But for discerning hereof, he saith, we are to consider, first how Antichrists church is described in Gods vvord: secondly, what the state of the church of Rome is at this day. And so proceeding in his description, he speaketh of the Church and Syna∣gogue of Antichrist, of the Beast, of the great City, of the man of sinne, of the great vvhore, of Abaddon or Apollyon, the sonne of perdition, &c. whereas he should treat of the Temple of God, vvhereof Paul speaketh, vvhose writings I sup∣pose he vvill not deny to be Gods vvord. But thus it was best for his plea,
to keep (what he could) from the point of the question in hand, & there∣fore also to confound things that differ, as he doeth throughout his trea∣tise. So all his plea is frivolous, and not to the purpose. Likevvise whenM. Ain. Animad. p. 77. he tels us of a Church, such as Bellarmine and others describe, one part vvhereof liues on earth, an other under the earth, and a third part in heauen, &c. whereas our question is of the Temple of God, vvhereof Paul speaketh 2 Thes. 2, 4. and of the Court and holy City, vvhereof Iohn spea∣keth, Revel. 11, 2. vvhich heretoforeM. Ain. defence of Script. p. 12 13, 14, 15. this man himself acknovv∣ledged and proved by the Scriptures to be the Church of God. Yet the wri∣tings of Bellarmine and other Papists were extant then, asvvell as now: and the novv Romish religion (whereof he speaketh) described their church then, as novv it doeth. But the case is altered with himself: vayn shifts & pre∣tences are become his usuall pleas in opposition of the truth, and for the maintenance of his errors and evill dealing. After these things premised, comming (as he saith) to our arguments: he speaketh as follovveth.M. Ainsw. p. 77, 78. Their first reason (saith he) from 2 Thes. 2, 4. is unperfect∣ly alledged, for the text there saith of the Man of sinne, that he doth sit as God in the Temple of God: whereupon their conclusion must be, that Antichrist sitteth as God in the Church of God. And if they can proue that he is the true God, I will yeeld that his Temple is the true Temple, and his church the true church. Other∣weise, if he be but an Idoll and not God: his Temple church and body, will proue but an Idoll like himself, and his blasphemie is vvorse then theirs which said,Rev. 2, 9 and 3, 9. they were Ievves and were not, but did lye, and vvere the Synagogue of Sathan. These are M. Ainsw. words: and this answer he giveth to that vvhich I observed out of 2 Thes. 2, 4. vvhich I noted dovvnePag. 140. here a litle before. Now hovv full of shifts, errors, absurdities, abuse of Scripture, and contradiction to himself this ansvver is, the text and matter it self declareth. Of vvhich I vvill speak straight vvay. But first mark, and in some respects marvell, how all these should proceed from this man, in this matter, in one and so short a speach & passage: if it vvere not that God would thus shew his just work in him, for the more humbling of himself, and warning of others by his example to take heed of such cariage and dealing, as he is fallen into. Novv touching the matter in hand, although I could alledge (vvhich perhaps himself would upon like occasion) that those words (as God) where about he cavileth and useth his course of shifting, are not in the Claro∣montane Greek copie of the Original, neyther in the Syriack or old La∣tin Translations,Bez. An∣not. in 2 Thes. 2, 4 as M. Beza observeth in his Annotations upon this place: yet vvil I not insist thereupon, but keep unto the vvords, as they are in the Greek copies and translations usually. And first, let this be noted & remembred, that the question here trea∣ted off, vvas, vvhether the church of Rome vvere the church of God, or no: vvhere∣upon I alledged those vvords of the Apostle, vvhere he saith that Anti∣christ should sit in the Temple of God, 2 Thes. 2, 4. and so insisted thereon: And that the question vvas not, about the maner of Antichrists sitting in the Temple of God, vvhether he should sit as God therein, or no. For that was
not the point in hand, nor is called in question betvven us. And therefore I needed not novv alledge these words, or insist thereupon. And this is knowen to be usuall in all vvriters and disputers, sometimes not so much as to mention, sometimes not to insist at all upon such words, whether of Scripture, or of other vvriters, as perteyn not to the argument and mat∣ter in hand, or may well be omitted in other respects. Which this man himself knovveth so vvell, as I need not giue him any instances thereof. Let his ovvn vvritings and other mens be observed hereabout. Or to let them alone, obserue but these allegations in the Scripture, with the par∣ticulars there mentioned and treated off, viz. Heb. 12, 26. compared with Hag. 2, 6. Also Rom. 10, 6, 7, 8. with Deut. 30, 11 — 14. And Mat. 21, 8. with Zach. 9, 9. So all this ansvver is but a shift and a meer cavill. Secondly, for the question and point in hand, mark the words of the text, that the Man of sin opposeth & exalteth himself aboue al that is called God, &c. so that he as God sitteth in the Temple of God &c. In the Temple of God, saith the text: it saith not, As in the Temple of God: as this mans exception would imply, with the inferences made thereupon. In deed the Apostle speaking of the maner of Antichrists sitting, saith, that he sitteth as God: but speaking of the seat where he sitteth, he saith expressely, in the Temple of God: and saith not, as in the Temple of God: as the answer here would im∣port: vvhich therefore is meerly shifting and full of deceit. Thirdly, he doeth not onely corrupt the text with evill gloses (one upon another) but he doeth in deed abuse the Scripture and directly pervert it, vvhen for an inference he saith, If they can proue that Antichrist is the true God, &c. as if Pauls vvords were not plaine to such as will under∣stand, that Antichrist exalteth himself aboue all that is called God, so that he as God, sitteth in the Temple of God, &c. and therefore is not the true God, but the man of sinne, & sonne of perdition, although that he as God sit in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 2 Thes. 2, 4. Fourthly, difference is to be put (as I haue noted here before) between the man of sinne that sitteth, and betvveen the Temple vvherein he sitteth. The Man of sinne himself (saith the Apostle) sitteth as God: yet the Temple wherein he sitteth (saith the same Apostle) is the Temple of God. And other∣vvise how is it possible, if he vvere in deed true God sitting in the Temple of God, that he should also be the Man of sinne, and sonne of perditi∣on, &c. But see the like in the cases (Pag. 125 126. &c. before mentioned) that fell out at Ierusalem and the Temple there: vvhen Baals Idoll of indignation vvas set at the entry of the house of God, Ezech. 8, 3, 5. and vvhen Antiochus Epiphanes and his Officers profaned the Sanctuarie & city of Ierusalem, and set the image of Iupiter Olympius in the Temple and seat of God, Dan. 11, 31, 36. &c. who vvould not novv put difference between the idols and persons aforesaid, on the one hand; and betvveen the Temple and ci∣ty of God, vvherein they vvere set, & vvhich they polluted, on the other. And if question should be made, vvhether the Temple and city so pollu∣ted, vvere yet still notwithstanding the Temple and city of God: and one
for proof thereof, should alledge the Scriptures aforesaid: would any Opposite now reasoning thereabout, be so absurde and voyd of reason, as to make this or such like inference thereupon, If they can proue that the idoll of Baal or Iupiter, that Antiochus or any of his Officers is the true God, then I wil yeeld that Baals Temple, Jupiters Temple, Antiochus and his Officers Temple, is the true Tem∣ple, and their city the true city. Otherwise &c. Or vvho vvould not rather in the feare of God reason thus: Although that Baal, Iupiter, Antiochus and his Officers, be idols and vile persons, yea an abomination of desolation: yet the Sanctuarie and city of Ierusalem, wherein they were set, and which they profaned, were still Gods Temple and holy city notvvithstanding. Fiftly, obserue here & throughout his treatise, hovv still he calleth that the Temple, Church and body of Antichrist, vvhich Paul expressely and purpose∣ly calleth the Temple of God. And so therein note still his shifts, and his er∣rours, &c. When Antiochus had polluted the Temple of God at Jerusalem, and had set the image of Iupiter Olympius therein, he sent then also an old man of Athens to compell the Iewes to call it the Temple of Jupiter Olympius. 2 Mach. 6, 1, 2. Antichrist likevvise (typed by Antiochus) hath polluted the Temple of God in the church of Rome, & other like churches, sitting therein as God and shewing himself to be God. 2 Thes. 2, 4. and novv cometh this man of him∣self, and (like the old man of Athens) wil needs call it, & perswade others to esteem and call it, the Temple of Antichrist, the church of Antichrist, the body of Antichrist, the Synagogue of Sathan, &c. Sixtly, he doeth not onely pervert the Scripture, but also crosse & con∣tradict it, vvhiles that vvhich the Apostle saith is the Temple of God, he saith it is an idoll, like Antichrist himself. Finally, hovv ever he vvould shift of, pervert, & obscure this Scripture, and the matter in hand: yet the light of the trueth so shineth before his eyes, as euen here himself is forced to note and set it downe, that upon the Apostles words, who saith, the man of sinne sitteth as God in the Temple of God, our conclusion must be, that Antichrist sitteth as God in the church of God. These are his owne words: and so in deed let this be our conclusion, that Antichrist (as the Apostle saith) is exalted aboue all that is called God, or that is wor∣shipped: so that he as God sitteth in the church of God. Now then this man himself cannot deny, but the Apostles vvords will beare this inference: yea he saith, our conclusion must be thus hereupon. So notwithstanding all his strugling and opposition here against, he is now driuen (nill he, will he) to giue us the cause against himself: and to overthrovv all his ovvne writing hereabout. Which being novv done by himself: I may the better spare labour, in manifesting the vanity and iniquity of his pretended ex∣ceptions. Onely (because the point is of vvaight, and of needfull use a∣gainst the Papists and Anabaptists) I will here briefly note a fevv things more, which may giue some light for the present, and occasion of further search hereafter, about this matter. And first, seeing novv themselues affirme, that our conclusion, upon the Apostles words, must be this, that Antichrist as God sitteth in the church of
God: I aske, vvhat church of God it is, vvhereof the Apostle saith here, that Antichrist as God sitteth therein. If they say, it is the church of Rome, they giue us the cause. If they say, it is not the church of Rome, but some other, let them then shew it. But in the vvhole processe of this treatise of theirs, they still speak of the church of Rome. And all the termes that here are used by the Apostle, of the man of sinne, the sonne of perdition, his opposition, his ex∣altation, his sitting as God, his shewing himself to be God, &c. they apply to Anti∣christ the Pope of Rome and his hierarchie. But vvhen they come to this other clause of the Temple of God, to expound it of the Temple body and Church of Antichrist, the Synagogue of Sathan, the Temple of the divell, &c. as they speak almost in every sentence of their treatise hereabout; and this also in such sort, as they vvill not haue it understood to be the church of God; hovv straunge is this? how far differing from their better and sounder vvri∣tings heretofore? If vve should thus expound and apply the Scripture, what outcryes should we heare, what reproach should we beare at their hands? When M. Sm. (as vve savvPag. 133 erevvhile) applied the city & court with∣out the Temple, (spoken off Rev. 11, 2.) to the confused assemblies of Antichrist, & Antichristian persecuters, M. Ains. could not bear it, that the Court of the Tem∣ple should betoken Antichrists church, &c. but did soundly convince and sharp∣ly rebuke him. Yet now loe, himself in this treatise, vvill haue the Temple of God, spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 4. not onely to signifie the church of Antichrist, the Synagogue of Antichrist, the Temple, Church and body of Anti∣christ, &c. but cannot endure that others should otherwise understand it, of the church of God: as by his writing, reviling, & assertions may appeare. Here therefore for the better clearing & understanding of the matter, let me aske moreover, whether these two propositiōs come to a like end, & agree the one vvith the other, to note out the same thing, or not: viz. The man of sinne sitteth in the Temple of God. And, Antichrist sittethor, in the Church of Rome, and other like churches of Christians. in the church of Rome. If they be alike, and accord together in one, the cause will be plaine. If not, let them shevv the difference between these propositions, that so the meaning of this Scripture may the better be found out. And vvhereas also the terme (sitting) noteth authority, and continuance (asM. Ains. Annot on Psal. 1, 1. and 61, 8. & 102, 13. &c. himself othervvhere vvell observeth) let him tell us vvithal, whether Antichrists authoritie and continuance, be in the church of Rome, or not: according as the Apostle speaketh here, of the Man of sin sitting in the Temple of God. If he say, the authoritie and continuance of Antichrist, is in the church of Rome, the case againe will thus also be evident. If he say, it is not there; let him then shevv us the Temple of God (spoken off by the Apo∣stle) vvhere it is. Thus tvvo lines, keeping directly to the point in question, will more clear the matter, and better convince both Papist and Anaba∣ptist; then tvvo thousand, full of shifts & errors, vvhich doe but the more harden both of them against the trueth, though severall wayes. But I wil proceed.
Animad. p. 78.The second thing, that here he insisteth upon, is the word Temple. But the Apostles words are, the Temple of God: unto which he should haue kept: as vvill more appeare afterward. In the meane time, obserue hovv he which euen novv said, our reason was unperfitly alledged, because of the omis∣sion of these vvords (as God) vvhich perteyning to another point then the question in hand, might here therefore so be omitted: yet doth now presently himself leaue out such words, vvhich as touching the point in question may not be left out at all. The particulars follovving vvil shew it more plainly. He saith, we take it for granted, that by the Temple is meant the church: & so goe on in obscuritie.Advert. p. 58, 59. My vvords were these, speaking of the Apostles speach, vvhere he saith Antichrist should sit in the Temple of God, 2 Thes. 2, 4. that here, by the Temple of God understanding the church of God, it will follovv that Antichrist should sit in the church of God: and is there to be sought and found, & not among the Jewes, Turks, Pagans, &c. Where first mark, that I spake not of the Temple onely, but of the Temple of God, as the Apostle also doeth Secondly, I doe in deed here deriue the reason from this exposition thereof, that by the Temple of God is understood the church of God. Which, if it could be shevved not to be agreeable to the Scriptures otherwhere, or that this place would not bear it, I haue done. But it is so evident, that1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6, 16. the Scri∣pture thus useth it, as euen here, in the very next passage, this man himself graunteth it. Neyther doeth he shew any one place of the Scripture, where this phrase of the Temple of God used figuratiuely, as it is here, doth signify any other thing, then the church and people of God. And what should I look for of an Opponent (that vvould deal soundly and syncerely) but that now he should proue that it is not here meant of the Church of God: and should also shevv vvhereof it is to be understood: and that by the word of God. Which till he doe, let the Reader obserue his exceptions here, how idle they are, and to no purpose for the matter in hand. As first of all, vvhen he saith, that the Temple did primarily figure out Christ, Joh. 2, 19, 21. and the Lord God almighty, & the Lamb is the Temple in the heauen∣ly Ierusalem Rev. 21, 22. To vvhat purpose is this? will it hereupon follow, that therefore by the Temple of God, 2 Thes. 2, 4. vve may not understant the Church of God? Or that they vvhich doe so, goe on in obscuritie? But if in this sense (saith he) we understand that speach of Paul touching Antichrist, then must vve translate the vvords (asAugust. de civ. Dei. l. 20, c. 19. some auncient Doctors haue done) eis ton Naon, for the Temple, or, as if himself vvere the Temple: &c. Where note first, how he spea∣keth this with an If: & secondly, that he telleth not, vvhether himself doe think, that it is thus to be understood, or thus to be translated, or not. Which when he resolveth upon for himself, and so sheweth it, then may it more be considered of. In the mean time, let the Reader obserue, how himself goeth on in obscuritie, vvhat he can. And for the phrase it self, this onely for the present I will here note (and leaue it to be observed and
considered by the Reader): that where Matthevv hath, eis to onoma tou pa∣tros, &c. into the name of the Father &c. Mat. 28, 19. Luke hath for it, epi to onomati Jesou Christou,or, upon in the name of Iesus Christ, Act. 2, 37.M. Brigh on Rev. 1 2. & en to onoma∣ti tou Koriou, in the name of the Lord, Act. 10, 48. And a good writer trea∣ting on Rev. 16, 2. on those words, eis tous anthropous, saith They upon vvhō this ulcer (there spoken off) seizeth, are men: there fell an ulcer against men, as Be∣za turnes it, or into men, as the vulgar reads, that is, on men, as Antichrist is said to sit into the Temple, for in the Temple, 2 Thes. 2, 4. But the praeposition with an accusatiue case soundeth, as if the sores did vex not so much by † sticking in the body, as by afflicting it from without; which doth more agree to these figuratiue sores, &c. And whether some such thing likewise may not here be observed about this phrase, eis ton naon tou Theou os Theon cathisai, to sit as Godor, upon See Esa. 1 13. into the Temple of God, where the same praeposition & case is used; or els moreover to note out some very near, deep, close, or inward sitting of Antichrist, into or in the Temple of God; I leaue to be further considered: desiring that the true meaning hereof (vvhat can be) may be searched and found out, for the better ending of these and sundry other questions, vvhereunto this vvould giue great light and help. As for theAugu∣stine. auncient Doctor whom here he citeth, let us heare himself speak. His words are these, That which isNote thes particulars the temple of any idol or Divell, the Apo∣stle would not callNotethes particulars the Temple of God. Whereupon some will haue in this place, not the Prince himself, but after a manner his whole body, that is, the multitude of men perteyning unto him together with himself under the Prince, understood to be Antichrist. And more rightly they think it also to be said in Latin as in the Greek: that he sitteth not in the Temple of God, but for the Temple of God, which is theNotethes particulars church. As we say he sitteth for a friend, that is, as a friend. August. de civit. Dei, lib. 20. c. 19. Where note how farre differing Au∣gustine is from this man that citeth him. 1. Augustine speaketh not one∣ly of the Temple, as he doeth here, but of the Temple of God, keeping the A∣postles vvords. 2. Augustine saith expressely, the Apostle would not call that the Temple of God, which were the Temple of an idol or of the Divel; where∣as this man everie foot calleth itAnimad p. 78 — 82, 94, &c. an idoll like Antichrist himself, the church and Temple of Antichrist, the Synagogue of Sathan, such as the type thereof should be fetched (not from the Temple of God at Ierusalem, but) from Jeroboams Temple, and Bels Temple in Babylon, yea such as is no more the Temple of God, then the Divel which appeared to the vvitch at Endor was Samuell, &c. Would the Apostles (think vve) or Augustine eyther cal these or such like the Temple of God? 3. Nay, Augustine (relating here the opinions of o∣thers about this, and the translation vvithall) notes expressely and takes it for granted, that the Temple of God, is the Church. Which this man op∣pugneth. 4. Or doth Augustine expound it of Christ himself, as here he ap∣plyeth it? Other particulars I insist not upō: of the translation & interpre∣tation I haue spoken here before, leaving it so to be considered of, as shal be found most agreeable to this & other Scriptures compared together. Novv vvhere he saith, that Antichrist (the Pope) proclaimeth himself to be the bridegrome of the church, which is the office of Christ; to be the Greatest high-prist; to haue power aboue all power, as well of heauen as of earth, &c. these things plainly
perteyne to those clauses of the Apostle, where he describeth Antichrist, vvith his hierarchie, to the man of sinne, the sonne of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself aboue all that is called God, &c. and so touch not in deed the point of the controversie betvveen us; vvhich is not of Antichrist that sit∣teth, &c. but of the Temple of God, vvhere he sitteth. Onely note this with∣al, that it is in some respect against himself, & may also giue some light to the question in hand, inasmuch as these things (by his ovvne graunt here) are ascribed to Antichrist, and the Pope; by vvhom there is no doubt, but he meaneth the Pope of Rome. Whereupon it will follow, that if there we fynd Antichrist the man of sinne thus set, there also must be sound the Temple of God vvherein thus he sitteth. Next he saith, that secondarily the Temple figured the Church, but first the catho∣like or universall Church, Ephes. 2, 21. then every particular ChurchNote this: for propor∣tion kept with Israel: which whē we speake of it, he op∣pugneth. Animad. p. 15. &c. by proportion, 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. And both these are the church or Churches of God, as appea∣reth by the Scriptures here cited by himself. Thus also it is plainly mani∣fest, that they who in this place apply it to the Church of God, understand it not othervvise, then as himself graunts the type & figure may lead un∣to. But yet of neyther of the tvvo, would he haue it here to be under∣stood: & therefore bringeth exceptions concerning both. Which let the Reader well obserue and remember. And the rather, because that euen here a litle after he saith expressely, thatAnimad. pag. 80. when the Apostle telleth us, that Antichrist sitteth as God, in the Temple of God, it is to be understood of their invading and destroying of Gods church and people, as the heathens of old dealt vvith Jerusalem and dwellers therein. Hovv contradictorie these are the one unto the other, vvho can not discerne? and hovv novv will he reconcile these two together, that by the Temple of God is meant here, Gods Church invaded and destroyed by Antichrist: and yet that by the Temple of God here, is not to be understood the church of God, neyther universall, nor particular? But he saith, we shevv not which of these two we intend. Neither doeth he him∣self, when he saith here presently after, that Antichrist invaded and destroyed Gods church here meant by the Temple of God. Neyther did he it heretofore, when vvriting against M. Sm. he taught, thatM. Ain. def. of Scri. p. 14, 15. by the court and holy city (spo∣ken off Rev. 11, 2.) is signified the Church of God. And if thus he could haue rested, it had ben somewhat. But now (to destroy that vvhich he built be∣fore) he sets himself to perswade, that it can neyther be understood of a particular Church, nor of the catholick or universall. So as I might leaue him to mainteyne or to reverse his ovvne exposition hereof, vvhether he thinks to be best and in the meane time to consider how all this treatise, vvhich he intended against us, fals upon his owne head, and (if he think there be any waight in it) is in deed against himself. But because the point is of so great moment, although in respect of these Opposites I need not, yet in other respects I am not unwilling to note somevvhat more hereabout, leaving it still to myne ovvn & others further consideratiō, as shalbe found most agreable to the word of God, and to his vvork, by the event of things alreadie done and yet further to
be accomplished. By the Temple of God, properly taken, is usually meant the Temple that was at Ierusalem. And this (vve haue heard) did primarily figure out Christ, and secondarily the Church, both the catholick and universall, & particular Churches likewise. Whereunto may be annexed also, that it figured1 Cor. 6, 19. vvith 2 Cor. 5, 1. and 6, 16. 1 Pet. 2, 5. & so may here also, in 2 Thes. 2, 4. particular Christians, and (in severall respects) both their bodies and their soules and consciences. Moreover in that Temple at Ierusalem, there vvas the Courts, the holy place, and the most holy place. Which sometimes all of them together, sometimes some of them more particu∣larly are called the Temple. And so this word is diversely used and ap∣plied, as I haue shevvedPag. 128. before. Which therefore for the right under∣standing of the Scriptures, and touching the question in hand, is carefully to be observed and remembred. Novv touching the Scripture and question spoken off: where the Apo∣stle speaketh of the man of sinne sitting in the Temple of God,Bellar. cō∣trov 3, l. 3. c. 13, &c. Rhem, Test. in 2 Thes. 2, s 11. Bellarmine and the Papists vvill not haue it understood of the Church of God among Chistians: and thus farre M. Ains. and his followers agree with them in this place. But Bellarmine expounds it literally of the Temple of Ierusa∣lem; M. A. expoundsAnimad. p. 78 — 82. 93, 94. &c. it straungly of the Synagogue of Sathan, of the Temple of Antichrist and the Divell, &c. And here novv they differ one from another, and both of them from the trueth, as far as darknes doth from light. The Temple at Ierusalem was destroyed long since: and in the new Ie∣rusalem (which we expect clearly & shortly to come at the conversion of the Ievves to the Christian faith) there is no such Temple to be looked for: the sacrifices, shadovves, and ceremonies of the Law being now ceased. I saw no Temple therein (saith Iohn) for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lambe, are the Temple of it. Rev. 21, 2, 22. So vve may first cashier Bellarmines exposition: And then M.A. vvhich is (in some respects) a great deal more straunge, that by the Temple of God the Apostle should meane the Sy∣nagogue of Sathan, the Temple of Antichrist and the Divell, &c. Against vvhich, if there vvere neyther other Scripture, nor any other thing at all, but that the Apostle here describeth it by this Name of the Temple of God, & calleth Antichrists sitting therein as God,2 Thes. 2, 7. a mysterie of iniquity, it vvere ynough to teach us to advise well, and to take far more heed thereabout. For is this terme of the Temple of God, ever so taken in the Scripture? Would the Apostle (saith Augustine) call the Temple of an idoll or of the Divell, the Temple of God? Or when he describeth the mysterie of Anti∣christs iniquity, would he teach the Church, that the place of his sitting is the Temple of God, if he meant that it vvere in deed the Synagogue of Sathan & the Temple of Antichrist? For that Antichrist should sit in the Temple of Antichrist; and Synagogue of Sathan, what mysterie is there in it? All the world would easily perceiue, that these agreed very vvell, and most fitly together. But for Antichrist to sit in Gods Temple and Christs Church, this is in deed a mysterie, and a mysterie of iniquity: such as men had
need open the eyes of their understanding, and set their hearts religious∣ly to consider it, if they vvould discerne it, as it is. Which may sufficiently appeare by these straunge expositions, and like erroneous courses, found among the Papists, Anabaptists, these men, and other such, vvhether Po∣pishly or Anabaptistically addicted hereabout. And what may we think is it that induceth thē hereunto? Is it not first, that this is a mysterie of iniquitie, which eyther is not readily perceived, or not rightly esteemed, as it should? Is it not vvithall in the Papists, that they would turn away the application of this Scripture from the Pope & church of Rome: and therefore vvould send us to the Temple of Ierusa∣lem, to find out this mysterie there? Is it not also (on another hand) in these men vvith the Anabaptists and others like mynded, that they can∣not endure that the Church of Rome should any way be esteemed the Church of God: and therefore wil rather by the Temple of God understand the Synagogue of Sathan, and Temple of Antichrist, then they vvil admit that the church of Rome, should be the Temple and church of God. For my self, my purpose is not to plead for the corrupt and adulterate estate of the church of Rome, or of any degenerate churches at all: much lesse for any impietie or iniquitie of the Man of sinne, of Antichrist or his hierarchie, of the corruptions, false worship, or superstitions of that apo∣stasie: against vvhich I haue heretofore many yeres in prison, and now also (by the mercy of God) this twentie yeeres in exile witnessed, and stil doe vvitnesse the trueth of Christ, vvhat in me is, and in that measure as it pleaseth him to manifest and vouchsafe unto me. But my purpose is to shew, that difference is to be put betvveen the Temple of God, where Anti∣christ sitteth, and betvveen Antichrist himself, who as God sitteth therein; that so the cause of the Protestants in general, and ours in particular, may be kept sound and intire both against the Papists and popish corruptions on the one hand, and against the Anabaptists and Anabaptistical aberrations, on the other. Now therefore to speak of the church of Rome in this respect, & how this terme is used: it is taken either particularly, or more generally. If vve understand it of a parttcular church (as the Apostle wroteEpist. to the Romās. his Epistle to the church there:) how shall we soundly deny eyther it to be the Temple of God, or Antichrist to be set therein? Euen the Papists themselues hold and tell us, that theAnton. Sum. part. 3. tit. 21. cap. 2.  6. Laterane Church in Rome, is the Parish Church of the Bishop of Rome. Which is much to be observed about this question. And himself saith here (as the trueth is) that the Tsmple figured every particular church: and therefore also the particular Church of Rome. Which thing alone might suffice for the controversie in hand. And that the more, because the An∣tichristian usurpation, opposition, exaltation, extent of unlavvfull jurisdi∣ction, and other such corruptions, growen up since the first plantation of that church, are rather to be referred to the Bishops of that church, then to that particular church it self: and doe more fitly and properly apper∣teyne to those clauses of the Apostles description of Antichrist, where he
calleth him the man of sinne, opposing and exalting himself aboue al that is called God, or is reverend, sitting as God, and shewing himself that he is God, &c. then to this other clause of, the Temple of God, whereabout our question is. Like as in the Revelation, they are to be referred to the Beast, not to the church and people of God, in and over vvhich the beast tyrannizeth. Rev. 11, and 13, and 14, and 17, and 18 chapt. If it be understood more generally, then may it be applied to all other such Christian churches, as synce the prevayling of Antichrist (the Pope of Rome) are come under his jurisdiction and government,Rev. 11, 2. and vvherein he sitteth, or treadeth thereon, though not in his ovvne person in each of them, yet by his hierarchie, authoritie, usurpation, and jurisdiction. And if we mark it also, we shal find that not the Pope onely, but the other hie∣rarchicall Prelates, Diocesan, Provinciall, & the like, haue the Parishes or particular churches perteyning to their jurisdictions, vvherein they sit, al∣though not in their owne persons, yet by their hierarchie and authority. Yea euen at Rome to this day, the Cardinals (that are next to the Pope himself) are all of them Presbyters or Deacons, and haue each of them their particular church or parish, whereof they are named, and vvhere∣unto more particularly they doe apperteyne. Whereupon (to note it by the vvay) this may also be observed, that if there be any Bishop at this day in our ovvn countrey or otherwhere, vvho hath not his particular Church or parish, whereof he is overseer, and whereunto he doeth pro∣perly appetteyne, all such are more degenerate from the auncient way & order of the Primitiue Churches, then is the Pope himself, in this behalf. And, if the Bishops haue stil every one his ovvn peculiar parish & church to vvhich they doe properly belong, it is a good print and footstep of the auncient vvay, wherein the churches vvere planted at first by the Apostles and Euangelists: And is a point that vvill giue great light to this & other questions, novv much controverted about the order and government of the church. Note here also, hovv the very things vvhich the Prelates chalenge in the particular churches under them, are jurisdiction and ordination: And that othervvise they leaue the particular Parishes to their ovvn peculiar Ministers, for the ministration of the word and Sacraments among them ordinarily. Which is observed in all churches & by all Prelates, euen the most Popish, and under the Pope himself, unto this day. And is a point also that vvill giue light to the better understanding of the estate of the Prelacy, and condition of theParishio∣nall, Dio∣cesan, Pro∣vinciall, &c. churches perteyning unto them, of what sort soever. But to proceed: I am not ignorant that the termes of Diocesan, Pro∣vinciall, Nationall, & Oecumenical or universal churches, are also other∣wise used and applied: and are ascribed to representatiue Churches, to Councils, Convocations, Synodes, Courts, and the like: whereof there may be some use & consideration not unprofitable about the matter here in hand, so it be not otherwise abused. For vvho knoweth not that the Pope hath novv a
long time sit in Councils, Courts, and other Christian assemblies, opposing and exalting himself aboue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, shevving himself that he is God; establishing, confirming, and disanul∣ling vvhat he would, ruling & overruling vvhom, vvhen, & as he would: yet not present stil in his own person, but sometimes by his designed sub∣stitutes, alvvaies by his usurped povver, authoritie, and jurisdiction. But of this I vvill not insist. It may suffice, for the point in hand, that Anti∣christ is so set and exalted as hath ben said, in the Christian Churches a∣foresaid, which (I suppose) these men themselues being better advised vvill not deny to be the Churches and Temple of God. Or if they doe, then I hope they will shevv of vvhat other church or churches they un∣derstand this Scripture, and hovv that vvhich the Apostle teacheth in this place, is by the Man of sinne performed in the Temple of God: Al∣vvaies remembring to distinguish betvveen the man of sinne himself, and between the Temple of God wherein he sitteth, &c. And this for the pre∣sent I thought to note hereabout. Animadv. p. 78.Where he saith, if we meane a particular Church, it will not agree with the pro∣phecies of Antichrist, whose City or church is so great, as peoples kinreds toungues and nations doe dwell in the streets thereof. Rev. 11, 8, 9. I ansvver first, that stil he cals that Antichrists church, vvhich the Apostle cals the Temple of God. II. Secondly, how vvill he proue that the Beasts city (spoken off, Rev. 11, 8.) is the Temple of God, spoken of, 2 Thes. 2, 4. If he say, he speaks not of the Temple of God, then he speaks not of the point in hand. If he speak of it, why doeth he still call it the City, Church and Temple of Antichrist, and not the Temple of God, as the Apostle termes it? Hath the very phrase of the Scripture so much light in it, as he can not endure to look upon it? Or doth he in these things, loue darknes more then light? Or is there no difference to be put between Antichrists City, and Gods church? III. Thirdly, having this occasion, I vvill propound some things here∣about, and leaue them further to be considered off: being assured that if the true meaning of these Scriptures be rightly found out, the difficultie about these and sundry other matters will be far the more easy. Where∣as therefore he doth not distinguish betvveen the City, and the Church, but here and throughout his treatise usually confounds them as all one: let us obserue and consider of these things thereabout. 1. That this City (spoken off inRev. 11, 8. the place that he alledgeth) is spiritu∣ally called Sodome and Egypt, where also our Lord vvas crucified. But the church is here called the Temple of God, or the Court vvithout the Temple, or the holy Ci∣ty, &c. For which see 2 Thes. 2, 4. and the chapter it self vvhich here he citeth, Revel. 11, 2. 2. That this great city is not onely Sodome and Egypt spiritually, but is also that Sodome & Egypt, where our Lord was crucified. Rev. 11, 8. Now al know, that Christ our Lord vvas crucified in and under the jurisdiction of the City, not of the Church of Rome. For he vvas condemned to death by
Pontius Pilate the Deputie of the Romane Emperour (under whose do∣minion and jurisdiction now the Iewes were) and vvas crucified by the Romane souldjours, being delivered to the Gentiles (when yet there was no church at Rome:) as Christ himself had before told his disciples. Mat. 27, 2, 11, 26, 27, 31, 35. with 20, 17, 18, 19. Luke 18, 31, 32, 33. and 23, 1, 2, &c. Joh. 18, 28, 31. & 19, 1, 2, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 23. &c. Which is also acknowledged by this man himself here a litle after. Animadv. pag. 83. 3. That this City is that, which vvas the Dragons throne, and was by the Dragon giuen to the Beast. Rev. 13, 2. vvhich this man himself also no∣teth, though to another purpose, Animad. pag. 79. But this was the City (not the Church) of Rome. Neyther, I think, will these men themselues say, that the Church vvas the Dragons throne, or was by the Dragon giuen to the Beast. 4. That this City also is the throne of the Beast, & Babylon the great City, spo∣ken of Rev. 16, 10, 19. and 17, & 18 ch. Which, that it is to be understood of the city of Rome, and the dominion thereof, vvill yet appeare further by the reasons follovving. And note here howM. Brigh∣on Rev. 16.19. some treating on Rev. 16, 19. expound great Babylon there, to be the city of Constantinople, called New Rome. Which then maketh the more for the point in hand. 5. That this city is the woman that sitteth on seuen mountaines. Rev. 17, 9, 18. And that the City, (not the church) of Rome, is built onCalled, Palatinus, Capitolinus Qurinalis, Aventinus Caelius, Esquilinus, Viminalis. seuen moun∣taines: As euenVirgil. Geor. 2. Ovid. de Trist. l. 1. Ele. 4. & l. 3. Eleg. 7. Proper∣tius, &c. the heathen Poets describe the situation thereof, before ever there vvas a Christian church there. 6. That this City hath seuen kings, or kinds of government, whereof fiue were fallen, vvhen Iohn wrote; one was then; and the other yet to come. Rev. 17, 9, 10. Which also is verified in the city of Rome: where the fiue severall sorts of government by Kings, Consuls, Dictators, Decemvirs, and Tribunes, were done & ceased, before Iohns time: The sixt, by Emperours, was then when he lived and wrote this: the other by Popes, vvas not yet come. But how should this be found in the church of Rome: vvhich was not before Iohns time: and therefore could not haue fiue kings, or kinds of govern∣ment thereof then fallen, &c. 7. That this city, this Babylon, this woman, is that great city which reigned over the kings of the earth, in Iohns time. Rev. 17, 18. And that not the church, but the City of Rome so reigned, vvhen Iohn vvrote these things, all doe acknovvledge. 8. Finally, that the Lord himself putteth difference betweene this City Babylon, and his people therein: foretelling that this Babylon shalbe utter∣ly burnt vvith fire, and throvvne downe with violence, so as it shall no more at all be found: Rev. 18, 2, 8, 9, 18, 20, 21. &c. and yet then calling his people out of her, Rev. 18, 4. Like as of old came to passe in the type here∣of: in Babylon of Chaldea: both for the wondrous desolation thereof; & for the calling of the Lords people out from thence. Jer. 50. and 51, 1 — 60, 61 — 64. with 50, 8, and 51, 6, 45. Esa. 48, 20. Zach. 2, 6, 7. Other moe reasons hereabout might be observed out of these & other
Chapters of this book of the Revelation, as also out of other Scriptures, and the event of things, some vvhereof are synce come to passe, and some remaine yet to be performed: But these may suffice to shevv hovv need∣full it is vvell to consider vvhat by the great city here spoken off, we are to understand; and heedfully to distinguish between the church, and the city it self. IIII, Fourthly, note here, that by the great city, is meant not onely the city it self, but the vvhole Iurisdiction, authority, and dominion thereof, how far soever extended. For (asM. Bright on Rev. 16 19. one well writeth) the City is not one∣ly the tovvn or piece of ground conteyned within compasse of the walles thereof, together with the Citizens and inhabitants, having order & go∣vernment among themselues, according to the Lavves and priviledges there had: but also the vvhole jurisdiction and government of the City, in all places perteyning thereunto. Which being observed, we may there∣by perceiue that the streets of this City reach farre, euen to all places under the jurisdiction thereof: and comprehend sundry peoples, and kinreds, and toungues, and nations: as here is said. Whereupon it is fitly compared to the great city Babylon, whose dominion and extent of government was ex∣ceeding large and great. Rev. 14, 8. and 16, 19. and 17, 5. and 18, 2, 3, 4, 7 — 21. compared with Esa. 13, 19. and 14, 6. and 47, 5. Jer. 50. and 51. Neyther is it one∣ly compared to cityes, but to Egypt also, that was a countrey. Which com∣parisons, though they haue other peculiar uses and applications, yet may also be observed in this behalf. Rev. 11, 8. And the more, seeing that the extent of this City is such, as reached euen to Ierusalem, where our Lord was crucified, as is noted also in this place. Rev. 11, 8. Where yet obserue further, that the Church of Rome being fallen into deep apostasie, and having the man of sinne sitting therein as God, who hath that city for his throne, &c. the things that are spoken of this city, are also applied to the apostate estate of that church of Rome, and the other churches that are under the jurisdictiō of the Prelacy of that Sea, where∣soever, and of vvhatsoever people, kinred, toungue, or nation they be. Which application thereof I doe also acknowledge, as it is observed by and ac∣cording to the vvord of God. Rev. 11, 8. with Esa. 1, 10. Jer. 23, 14. Ezech. 16, 2 — 46. &c. and Rev. 14, 8. and 17, and 18, &c. with Esa. 21, 9. and 48, 20. Jer. 50. and 51, 1 — 45. &c. Ezech. 16, 2 — 35, &c. and 23 chap. Zach. 2, 6, 7. But shal we therefore conclude, that by the Temple of God (spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 4.) may not be understood the Church of God. This is the point to be insisted upon: as also, whether we can soundly, and by vvarrant of the Scriptures deny the Church of Rome (though in defection) and other Churches in apo∣stasie to be the Churches of God; and not to be under his covenant; nor to haue his signes and seales thereof; nor any of his ordinances remayn∣ing among them: but that euen the Baptisme there had is an idoll, a fiction, a lying and deceitfull signe, a cursed and detestable Sacrament. Which hath ben and yet is a great occasion and mayne ground of Anabaptistrie: besides that it hardneth the Papists and others in their errours much the more, when
the Churches themselues, and the ordinances of God (though corrupted, yet) still continued unto and among them, are not so acknowledged by us, as they ought to be: Neyther so onely, but are eyther utterly denyed and disanulled; or so spoken and accounted off, as doth in deed necessa∣rily imply the deniall and disanulling thereof. When the Temple of God at Ierusalem was polluted and profaned, and that so exceeding sinfully, as God gaue it up vvith Ierusalem into the enemies hand, yet vvhenas then Nebucadnezar burnt it, the Lord tooke upon him the vengeance of his Temple vvith great severity: because though it vvas polluted, yet it was still the Lords Temple: vvhich he accordingly should haue regarded. Jer. 50, 28, and 51, 11. Which should teach all to take heed, hovv we esteeme and deale with the churches of God, though sinfully polluted and profaned. If the Lord were so carefull of the figure: shall we think he vvill haue no regard of the figured thing: vvhich this man himself here acknow∣ledgeth every particular church to be: & therefore also the church of Rome. But now he saith next, that to understand by the Temple of God a particular Church, is not answerable to the Temple of God in Israell, which was not for one Syna∣gogue, but forDeut. 16, 16. the whole nation of the Jevves, and for1 Kin. 8, 41, 42. Ioh. 12, 20. Act. 8, 27. the Gentiles that came to the faith, through the world: Hovv greatly forgets he himself, and hovv present∣ly, seing that here but a line before he said, the Temple figured not onely the catholike or universall Church, Ephes. 2, 21. but also every particular church by propor∣tion. 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. And may we not then apply it unto that, vvhereof it vvas a figure, and accordingly understand it? Or may not vve so under∣stand and apply it, as the Apostle doeth: vvho (as himself saith here) ap∣plies it to a particular church: 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. vvith which place may be joy∣ned, 2 Cor. 6.16. though that may also be further extended. Besides, was not the Temple in Israell, for any and every Synagogue, familie, and per∣son among them? And may not we now accordingly apply it to the Churches and Christians of the Gentiles? And that the more, seeing that then also it vvas for them, cōming to the faith of Israel, vvhether mo or fevver? Or vvere not the Ievves, distributed into severall and particular Synagogues: which being joyntly considered, vvere and might be estee∣med as one people? And are not the Christians (euen those among whom Antichrist hath most prevayled) distributed likewise into particular chur∣ches or parishes? Which if any would (in some good respect) consider joyntly as one people: vvho would striue about it; so as it were not any way abused for maintenance of any errour against the trueth or vvord of God? But of this I will not insist: neyther alledge other things that here might be observed. That alone may suffice, vvhich I noted here before. By reason whereof also I need not stand on that, vvhich he speaketh about the catholick or universall church, seing it is ynough for the matter in hand, to find it in the particular churches, so as is aforesaid. Yet some things by this occasion may here be noted vvithall. As namely, that the Church of Christ is sometimes accounted as oneSal. Song. 4, 12, 16. and 5, 1. & 6, 2, 11 garden, being consider∣ed joyntly in one; sometimes as many or sundrySal. Song 4, 15. & 6, 2. & 8, 13 gardens, in respect of
the divers particular congregations thereof. Each of which particular ones, both is a garden it self, and is also a part of that one or universal gar∣den of the Lord. So as he vvhich dwelleth, & the trees & herbes vvhich grovv, in any one of these, may be said to dwell and grovv not onely in that particular garden alone, but also in the general or universall garden, as it compriseth al the particular gardens within it; they being al of them parts of the generall. Likevvise the Church is sometimes resembled byExod. 25, 31. 2 Chr. 13, 11. Zac. 4, 2, 11. one Candlestick, having one shank or shaft, out of which come divers branches, vvherein areExod. 25 37. with Rev. 1, 11, 12, 20. and 2, & 3 ch. seuen severall lampes: so as the light vvhich is set in any one of the lampes, standeth not onely in that particular lampe, but in the generall candlestick: sometimes by2 King. 7, 49. 2 Chron. 4, 7.. ten candlesticks, sometimes byRev. 11, 4. two, &c. so noting both one catholick Church in generall, & divers par∣ticular Congregations in speciall: sometimes moe, sometimes fewer; yet so as they are alwaies parts and members of the generall or universall, vvhether they be moe in number and more florishing, or fevver & more decaying. Where note moreover, that the Candlesticks and Lampes were set in the Temple of God: and that the church of Rome, vvas a golden Candlestick, as well as the rest of the Primitiue Churches: & that this man himself saith definitely,Animad. p. 103. the true churches were many of them apostate, when John wrote, whom yet notwithstanding the Scripture calleth, & Christ acknowledgeth them to beRev. 1, 11 12, 20. and 2, 1. golden candlesticks. In any of vvhich, if Antichrist the man of sinne had sit, as in the church of Rome, I suppose this man vvould not deny, but his fitting then should haue ben in the Temple of God: whether it vvere cō∣sidered as a particular Lampe and Candlestick it self,M. Brig. on Rev. 11 4. or as a branch also and part of the great and generall Candlestick: vvhich isRev. 1, 11 12, 20. and 2, 1. observed (in the respects aforesaid) to be a type both of the Catholick church, and of the particular Congregations thereof: like as here the Temple is by this man himself acknowledged (and rightly) also to be a type of both. Animad. pag. 78. As for the catholick or universall Church, which the Pope claymeth for his Temple, what is that to us, vvho speak of the Temple of God, spoken off by the Apo∣stle, 2 Thes. 2, 4. And vvhereas he vvould be taught hovv that vvhorish compa∣ny that worship the Beast and Dragon, can be the true catholike church & spouse of Christ: although that which I haue noted before, be sufficient for the point in hand: neither meane I now to insist on other things: yet seeing thus he speaketh here, let him first remember hovv but a litle before he told us,Animad. p. 77. the catholike church of the novv Romish religion (as themselues describe it) hath one part thereof on earth, another under the earth, and a third part in heauen: & now here himself speaketh onely of such as are on earth: and those also such as vvorship the Dragon and the Beast, spoken off, Rev. 13, 4. whereas the Catholick Church in deed conteyneth al the Churches and people of God, that haue ben from the beginning of the world, (before ever there vvas a church, yea or a city at Rome) and that shalbe to the end of the vvorld, in any and every age thereof; and (in another respect) all and
onely the elect of God, both Angels and men. 2. And let himself now tell us, vvhether he think there was no other church or churches of Christians, catholick or particular, vvherein Anti∣christ sate, synce the apostasie of the Man of sinne, but such as worshipped the Dragon which gaue power unto the Beast, and the beast also himself withall? Rev. 13, 4. And who then were the Tabernacle, & those that dwelt in heauen, whom the beast blasphemed, and the Saints with whom he made vvarre, tvvo and fourty moneths. Rev. 13, 5, 6, 7. and of vvhat church, or churches they were; considering also, that the apostasie began so soone, and spread so far, and continued so long. 2 Thes. 2, 3 — 7. with Rev. 11, 1, 2, &c. 3. Let him also remember how Ierusalem, came to beEzec. 16, 2, 35, &c. and 23, 2 — 43. &c an harlot, old in adulteries, and the Ievves, to beEsa. 1, 4, 5, &c. a sinfull nation, laden with iniquitie, forsaking the Lord, and revolting more and more; yeaEsa. 57, 3 4, 5. &c. sonnes of the soceresse, the seed of the adul∣terer, and the whore;Esa. 65, 2 3, &c. a rebellious people, which walked in a way not good, after their ovvne thoughts;2 Chron. 36, 14. &c. transgressing after all the abominations of the heathen, and polluting the house of the Lord, which he had hallowed in Ierusalem, &c. vvhenas yet they vvere still notwithstanding the city, people, and temple of the Lord. Esa. 1, 3. and 3, 12. vvith Jer. 50, 28. and 51, 11, 35, 36, 45, 50, 51. 4. And as for the true catholick church and spouse of Christ, vvhereof he speaketh, besides that it conteyneth onely the elect, and all of them in all ages and places of the vvorld (as is aforesaid) himself also knoweth that it is a church invisible unto us; whereas our question is of the Temple of God, vvherein the Man of sinne sitteth, and so of the visible Church pollu∣ted and profaned by Antichrist, as the Temple of God at Ierusalem vvas of old both by the Iewes themselues, and by Antiochus, &c. 2 Thes. 2, 4. & Rev. 11, 2. compared with 2 Chron. 36, 14. &c. and Dan. 8, 9 — 14. and 11, 31. &c. 5. Lastly, obserue here, how still he speaketh and useth the terme of Antichrists Temple; vvhereas vve speak of the Temple of God, vvhereof the A∣postle speaketh 2 Thes. 2, 4. and so of the Lords Court and City, spoken of, Rev. 11, 2. vvhich hovv ever he cannot now admit to signifie the church of God; yet he hath both taught itDef. of Script. p. 14. &c. heretofore, so as he need not now be taught it again, if he will but peruse what himself formerly vvrote about this mat∣ter; and here againe he teacheth itAnimad. p. 80. in the very next page follovving, vvhere he interpreteth the Temple of God (2 Thes. 2 4. here spoken off) to be Gods church and people: thus still forgetting and contradicting himself: of vvhe∣thersoever he meane it, vvhether of the church catholick, or particular. Let him chuse vvhich he vvill, to expound it of, and apply it unto. And then let him tell us, vvhether it be no othervvise the church of God, but as the Divell himself is an Angell of light: expounding his own words as shal please him best. In the next place, vvhere he saith, thatAnimad p. 79. the very word Temple, leadeth us to understand Antichrists church to be but a counterfeyt, &c. mark first, how he keeps not the words of the Text. The Apostle saith not onely, the Temple, but the Temple of God. So his exception and assertion here (keeping to the Apostles vvords, and the point in hand) is this in deed, & thus to be pro∣pounded:
that the very phrase of the Temple of God, leadeth us to understand Antichrists church to be but a counterfeyt. Which if so it were, then also when the Apostle saith to the Church of Corinth, in the Scripture that himself citedAnimad. p. 78. here but a litle before,1 Cor. 3, 16. know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, his meaning should be according to this glose, know ye not that ye are a counter∣feyt church? Againe,ver. 17. If any man defile the Temple of God, him shall God destroy: that is, according to his collection here, If any man defile a counterfeyt church, him shall God destroy. And again,2 Cor. 6, 16. What agreement hath the Temple of God with idols? for ye are the Temple of the living God: that is, according to this under∣standing here, What agreement hath a counterfeyt church vvith idols? for ye are a counterfeyt church, &c. Or to keep to the word Temple alone, as himself here chuseth to doe, let him remember, hovv he said here, inAnimad. p. 78. the next page before, that the Temple figured out Christ primarily. Like as Christ speaking of his body said to the Ievves, Destroy this Temple, and in three dayes I vvill raise it up: speaking of the Temple of his body. Ioh. 2, 19, 21. Will this man therefore novv thereupon gather, as here he doeth, that the very vvord Temple, lead∣eth us to understand Christs body to be but a counterfeyt? So in deedDaenaeus in Augustin. de haeres. the Marci∣onites, and other hereticks of old held, that Christ was not truly man, but had a feyned and fantasticall body, vvhich he brought from heauen, and took not of the sub∣stance of the Virgin Marie: Wherefore also they put out of the Gospels, the genea∣logie of Christ described by Mathevv and Luke, &c. What a strength now such collections as this man maketh, giues to these heresies (revived again by some Anabaptists) let the wise judge: and let the weak take heed of such counterfeit gloses. Moreover, inAnimad. p. 80. the very next page following, he tels us, that Antichrists sitting as God in the Temple of God, spoken off, 2 Thes. 2, 4. is to be understood of his invading and destroying Gods church and people, as the heathens of old dealt vvith Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein. And novv here he tels us, the vvord Temple leadeth us to a counterfeyt. So as then by his doctrine eyther Antichrist hath invaded and destroyed but a counterfeyt: and therefore not the church & people of God in deed: neyther is his dealing like the heathens of old, vvho invaded and destroyed Ierusalem (the Lords city) and the dvvellers therein, in very deed: or els he doeth still contradict himself, as in deed he doeth. By which also may appeare, hovv notably this man himself playeth the counterfeyt: & so might be left, vvith all his counterfeyt gloses, till God giue him better grace: vvere it not that the trueth and good of others also are to be respected vvithall. Where he saith, the Temple and tabernacle in Israell vvas not the church & con∣gregation of Gods peopleproper∣ly. See vvhat he saith to M. Sm. herea∣bout. Def. of Scrip. p. 5, 8, &c. properly, but a sacramentall signe of Gods dvvelling vvith them, &c. What then? vvere they therefore but counterfeyts, & not a Tem∣ple and Tabernacle in deed and in trueth? Or did they not in Gods or∣dinance figure out the church (as himself affirmed here a litle before) & so were the church figuratiuely? Or doeth not the Apostle so understand and apply them, in the places before mentioned? 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6, 16.
Ephes. 2, 21. Circumcision also, and the Passeover in Israell, vvere signes of Gods covenant, leading unto Christ: were they therefore but counterfeyts; and not a cutting of the foreskin, and a lambe in very deed? Or were they not Gods holy Sacraments, and fit antitypes of ours, in deed and in trueth? Thus by his doctrine, might all Gods ordinances and types in Israell be esteemed but counterfeyts: and all the doctrines, comforts, dire∣ctions, that throughout the Scriptures (& inAnnot. on Gen. Exo. Psal. &c. his owne Annotations) are derived from them, might be turned avvay, as being taken but from coun∣terfeyts. Hovv this again may strengthen the Anabaptists in their errors, vvho vvould not haue us to reason from circumcision to baptisme, from Israell to the church now, &c. all of judgment vvill easily discerne. But novv at length, after he hath made a great florish to shevv that the Temple is a counterfeyt, and bestowed needles labour to note some severall things about the church of God, and the Beast (which in deed differ much the one from the other) in the end, he saith plainly,Animad. p. 79, 80. and would bring it in as his conclusion, that ” vvhen the Apostle telleth us, that Antichrist sitteth as God in the Temple of God, it is to be understood first of their invading and destroying of Gods church and people, as the heathens of old dealt vvith Ierusalem and the dvvel∣lers therein; secondly, of their ovvne vaine ostenstation, vvhiles they vvill haue it called the Christian catholick church, and the Pope the head of the same. That now at length, he speaketh thus plainely, it is vvell done; and is directly against himself, though he thinks not so: but whereas he vvould inferre this as a conclusion upon the premises, if he doe but offer to bring it into forme of reasoning, himself vvill soone perceiue how far he comes short. Yet novv a litle to insist upon this interpretation of his, as himself hath set it dovvne: first he saith, that vvhen the Apostle telleth us, that Antichrist sit∣teth as God in the Temple of God, it is to be understood, of their invading and destroying of Gods church and people, as the heathens of old dealt vvith Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein. What haue we here? Doth himself now by the Temple of God, spoken of 2 The. 2, 4. understand Gods church and people, yea such as was ansvverable to Ierusalem and the dvvellers therein of old? Why then hath he so eagerly oppugned us hereabout? Why hath he so muchAnimad. p. 78, and 79. here before pretended, that the temple of God vvhere Antichrist sitteth, is not the church of God, but an Idoll, like Antichrist himself, the Temple church and body of Antichrist, a coun∣terfeyt, &c. And vvhy doeth heIbid. p. 82 — 93, 94. &c. hereafter again pretend, that it is the Sy∣nagogue of Sathan, that Ieroboams Idoll Temples, & Bels Temple in Babylon, vvere the figures of it, that is no more the Temple of God, then the Divel which ap∣peared to the witch at Endor, was Samuell, &c. Doeth he not extreemly forget and contradict himself? Or hath heEzec. 14, 3 — 10. an Idoll (of mainteyning an errour, and pleasing his followers thereby) set up in his own heart: vvhich whiles he vvould giue homage unto, he is confounded in him self by the just judg∣ment of God: yea driuen to giue us the cause against himself, nill he will he? For vvhat can be more plaine, then that by the Temple of God2 Thes. 2 4. here, is to be understood Gods church and people? Well then, seing now he affirmeth, that it is to be understood of Gods
church and people, it remaineth that he consider with himself, vvhether it be the catholick and universall church of God, or some particular church or churches, that here is understood. Which he must the more carefully re∣gard, because butPag. 78. erewhile he said, the temple figured both the catholick church, and every particular church also: and yet would then perswade, that here it could be understood of neyther. But novv (no doubt) he vvill expound it of one or other, seing himself saith, the Apostles meaning is, by the Temple of God here to understand Gods church and people: and (that which is more) such as is ansvverable to Jerusalem and the dwellers therein: I suppose, he would say, the Temple in Ierusalem, unles, perhaps he haue some speciall purpose or pre∣tence in speaking othervvise. As I doubt not but he hath, vvhen he saith here that Antichrists sitting as God in the Temple of God is to be understood of their invading and destroying Gods church and people, &c. Of vvhich I come now to speak next. And first I aske, vvhere he can shew in the Scriptures, that sitting is put for inuading and destroying: and more particularly, that by sitting as God in the Temple of God, is to be understood the invading and destroying of Gods church and people? Secondly, I wish him and all to observe, hovv othervvhere still he tea∣cheth, according to the Scripture phrase, that by sitting is meant abiding, continuing, dvvelling; or companying, and having familiaritie together; or ruling, and reigning with continuance, &c. As may be seen in his Annotations on Psal. 1, 1. and 9, 5. and 61, 8. and 69, 13. and 99, 1. and 102, 13. and 110, 1. and 122, 5. and 141, 14, &c. From all which expositions, and the like, how far novv him∣self differeth, let the vvise judge. Ibid.Thirdly, here a litle before, and afterward again, he vvould persvvade that the Temple of God vvhere Antichrist sitteth as God, is an Idoll like himself, the Temple church and body of Antichrist, the Synagogue of Sathan, a counterfeyt, &c. If then by sitting in it as God, should be understood the invading and destroy∣ing thereof: the meaning should be this, that Antichrist should invade & destroy an Idoll like himself, his owne Temple church and body, the Sy∣nagogue of Sathan, a counterfeyt, &c. And vvere this then evill in him so to doe? For sure the Apostle speaketh of his sinfulnes. Or think they, that Antichrist hath done, or vvill doe thus? Ibid.Fourthly, he said also here before, that the Temple of God figured the church catholick, and particular. If then by sitting in it as God, be understood the in∣vading and destroying of it: he must shew vvhich of them he meaneth to be invaded and destroyed by Antichrist, the one or both of them. Fiftly, though it be true, that Antichrist invades Gods church and de∣stroyes many of his people (as both experience, and the description of the Beast, and of the man of sinne, and the types thereof in Nebuchadne∣zar and Antiochus doe manifest) yet here (for the point in hand) must be found out whether by sitting in the Temple of God, be understood the in∣vading and destroying thereof. And yet then also vvill follovv still, that by the Temple of God here, must be understood Gods church and people, answe∣rable
to the Temple and to Ierusalem and the dwellers therein: which is still against himself, as is noted before. And note further, that not onely Nebuchadnezar and Antiochus (spo∣ken off in the Scriptures here alledged) were types of Antichrist: but al∣so Pharaoh, Corah, Dathan, Abiram, Saul, Absalon, Ieroboam, Ahaz, Ieho∣jakim, the persecuting and apostate Priests, the false prophets, and divers others, both in Iudah and Israell and othervvhere: some in one respect, some in another: And that therefore to discerne the estate and dealing of Antichrist, we should not look alone at some one thing, type, or event; but at the many things, types, and events, that the Scripture shevveth, & which time and experience hath novv already manifested sundry waies, and will yet make more manifest hereafter, concerning this matter. O∣thervvise, great difference might be observed in the tipes and things spo∣ken off in the Scriptures here alledged. For Ieremie speaketh of Nebu∣zaradan a chief captain under Nebuchadnezar the king of Babylon, how he burnt the house of the Lord, and the houses of Ierusalem, and brake dovvne the walles thereof, &c. Jer. 52, 12, 13. &c. Lam. 2, 7, 9. To vvhich time the 97 Psalme also here alledged may be referred. Daniel speaketh of Antiochus king of Syria, who magnified himself against God, took avvay the dayly sacrifice, cast avvay the place of Gods sanctuarie, trode it & the host of God under foot, and (as it is in another place of the same prophe∣cy) polluted the Sanctuarie of strength, (or, the Sanctuarie and munition, meaning the Temple and city of Ierusalem) and placed the abomination that maketh desolate. So as though the Temple and City of Ierusalem novv remayned, yet they were polluted, spoiled, cast avvay, and trode un∣der foot. Dan. 8, 11, 13. and 11, 36. with ver. 31. Besides, the Iewes in the ca∣ptivitie of Babylon, acknowledge that their sinnes deserved it, as the Pro∣phets also for their sinnes had denounced it, Dan. 9, 5 — 14. Psal. 79, 8, 9. with Jeremies prophecy throughout. Whereas the Iewes in the persecution of An∣tiochus, alledge their integritie and faithfull constancie in the vvorship & service of God, euen unto death, Psal. 44, 17 — 22. Albeit that divers also then eyther by the persecution of Antiochus, or by his flatteries, or both, were corrupted and dealt vvickedly against the covenant of the Lord. Dan. 11, 32, 33, 34, 35. Wherein likevvise there was a fit type both of Anti∣christs dealing, and of the churches estate, in this behalf. And in all these times, the Iewes notvvithstanding, vvere the church & people of God; & though some of them were slayne and destroyed, yet among them still God preserved his Church and people from the destruction intended by their adversaries: Both vvhich as touching the question and Scripture in hand, should carefully be observed. Finally, this Scripture is so to be understood, as it may not contra∣dict but agree with that which is written, Rev. 11, 2, 3. where the Court of the Temple is giuen to the Gentiles, and the holy City trode upon, two and fourty moneths; (whether this be understoodResēbling the times of Eliah, of Antiochus of Christ a∣mong the Pharisees, &c. of shorter or longer times, which yet should haue an end, or (vvith ver. 3. of 1260 yeeres, putting a day for a
yere. And afterward the Temple of God is opened in heauen, and therein is seen the Ark of his Testament, or covenant, &c. Rev. 11, 19. and 14, 15, 17. and 15, 5, 6, 8. and 16, 1. And God hath his people stil in Babylon. Rev. 18, 4. So Gods church and people then remayne still undestroyed, notvvithstanding all the op∣position and exaltation of the Man of sinne, with all his tyranny, cruelty, and persecution, had in over and against the church and people of God, from time to time, untill himself (being the sonne of perdition) come to be consumed and destroyed in the end. Othervvise also the Anabaptists plea should here againe be strength∣ned, who holdM.S. cha∣ract. of the Beast. p. 56 &c. that Antichrist hath utterly destroyed the true Temple, the true church; and hath abolished the true baptisme of Christ: and that therefore they must reare up a new church, and get themselues a new baptisme, &c. And so they proceed from one errour and evill to another. Wherein this mans erroneous opinions and corrupt gloses may harden them much the more. And hitherto of the first exposition of the vvords aforesaid, that here is giuen. His other exposition is, that vvhen the Apostle saith, Antichrist sitteth as God in the Temple of God, it is to be understood of their owne vaine ostenta∣tion, vvhiles they vvill haueDoth he meane the church of Rome? or vvhat els speaketh he off. it (what I pray you) called the Christian catholick church, and the Pope the head of the same. First I ask, vvhereof he speaketh this, that they vvill haue it so called.? If of the Temple of God, himself in his very last vvords, told us, that by it is understood Gods church & people in deed. If he speak of some other thing, he speaketh not to the point in hand. And besides vvhat is it, that he speaketh off? And why doeth he not name it? Is it because if so he did, his exposition vvould be found eyther contradi∣ctorie to the former, or some other way to no purpose at all, but against himself? Secondly, if the Apostle had meant that it vvas not the temple of God in deed, but onely that they would haue it so called: could he not so haue expressed his mynd for this clause of the Temple of God, as he doeth in the next vvords touching Antichrist himself, vvhen he saith, he shevveth himself or pretendeth that he is God: and as the Scripture speaketh othervvhere, vvhen it noteth the blasphemie of them, which say they are Jewes, & are not, but are the Synagogue of Sathan, and so doe lye. Rev. 2, 9. and 3, 9. Thirdly, if it be thus to be understood, as now he saith, that it is not the Temple of God in deed, but onely that they vvill haue it so called in vain osten∣tation, making the Pope the head thereof: then (besides his strengthning again of the Anabaptists opinion aforesaid) his owne former exposition here giuen, can not stand, vvhere he said (in the last vvords before) that it is to be understood of Gods church and people invaded and destroyed by Antichrist, as Jerusalem and the dvvellers therein were dealt vvith by the heathens of old. For these were in deed the church and people of God (though sinfully corrupted) & not onely in their owne vaine ostentation, that they vvould be so called. Lastly, many often boast vainly of that, vvhich notvvithstanding they haue or may haue in deed, but yet abuse it or vvalk not worthy thereof: as I shevvedPag. 106. 107. heretofore, by the example of the Ievves here spoken off,
out of Esa. 48, 1, 2. Zeph. 3, 11. Matth. 3, 9. Ioh. 8, 37, 39. as likevvise the church of Rome hath a long time boasted, that it is the church of God, and as o∣ther churches and people also doe, vvhen yet they abuse and vvalk not vvorthy of that mercy of God unto them. Besides that Lucifer the king of Babylons vain boasting of his sitting on the mount of the Congregation, &c. did not hinder, but that it vvas in deed the Temple of God, and the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the North, &c. Esa. 14, 13. Other things here I omitt, as being meerly vaine in deed: that a particular church should challenge to be the catholick church (vvhich cannot be, as they understand it) & the Pope to be the head of the same: vvhich Christ onely is, and no other can be, Ephes. 1, 22, 23. Let these clauses therefore & all by-matters be omit∣ted, that perteyn not to the point in hand, & let the thing be simply pro∣pounded as it should be, thus, vvhether the church of Rome and other churches be Christian churches, or not: and then let all consider thereof indifferently, that so the trueth may be found out according to the vvord of God, whatsoe∣ver other opinions or prejudice vve haue had to the cōtrarie heretofore. And hitherto of these expositions of this Scripture. Next, whereas upon the understanding of this Scripture aforesaid, I brought in tvvo consequences: shevving hovv it would meet vvith and convince the errors both of the Papists and Anabaptists, &c. this Oppo∣site setteth himself to withstand in both, what he can. The first was this, that by the Temple of God (2 Thes. 2, 4.) understanding the church of God, it vvil fol∣lovv, that Antichrist should sit in the church of God, and is there to be sought & found, and not among the Ievves, Turks, Pagans, and the like, as the Papists and others vvould perswade us: To this he opposeth, saying, it is a fallacie from an insufficient divi∣sion, because all out of the true church are not Ievves, or Turks, or Pagans, but there is a fourth to make up the mease, euen popish Antichristians, among whom the man of sinne is to be found, &c. Where (omitting, that he setteth not down all my vvords) first I obserue, that now he maketh the Popish Antichristians to be the Temple of God, vvhere Antichrist is to be found: and but erewhile he told us, that by the Temple of God, vvhere Antichrist sitteth as God, is to be understood Gods church and people invaded and destroyed by Antichrist. So as eyther he thinketh the popish Antichristians to be Gods church and peo∣ple: or els he forgetteth and contradicteth himself extreemely. Secondly, let him tell us, vvhether the popish Antichristians, of whom he speaketh, be Christians, & in the church of God, or not. If he say, they are Christians, and in the church of God, he giveth us the cause, and doth but use fallacie to deceiue the simple, by the terme of popish Antichristians: our question now being of the Temple of God, vvhere Antichrist sitteth: and so of fynding him there, amongHow in other re∣spects, they are or may be termed popish An∣tichristians or other∣wise, I doe not here stand upon. Christians, and not among the Ievves, Turks, Pagans, and the like. If he say, they are not Christians, nor in the church of God: hovv then will he shevv that Antichrist is to be sought & found among them, seing he is to be sought and found in the Temple of God. Thirdly, I aske vvhen and vvhere those popish Antichristians begun & yet
are, of vvhom he speaketh? Also, whether they vvere popish Antichri∣stians, and not the churches of God, before Antichrist invaded and sate a∣mong them, or became to be such aftervvard. If he say, they were so be∣fore, let him tell us vvho they vvere, and shevv that such then was their estate. If he say, they became so aftervvard, let him then tel us, what they vvere before, whether Christians and the church of God, or not: & how long it vvas aftervvard, ere they ceased so to be: and vvho they are, of whom thus he speaketh: remembring still to distinguish betvveen Anti∣christ, and the Temple of God vvhere he sitteth. Fourthly, let him remember, how yll he took it, when M. Sm. (speaking of Rev. 11, 2.) applied the Court of the Temple, to the assemblies of Anti∣christ. Which interpretation then he calledDef. of Scrip. p. 12 13, 14, 15. impietie, dotage, his fancie, blynd∣nes of heart, abuse of the ord of God, &c. If he could not endure, that he should so interpret the court of the Temple, (spoken of by Iohn) how is it that now himself thus expounds the Temple of God (spoken of by Paul) to be po∣pish Antichristians? If it were then impietie, dotage, a fancie, blyndnes, and abuse of Gods word, so to expound & apply it, what thinks he it is novv? Fiftly, where he saith further, that in the true church Antichrist the man of sin hath sometimes ben found raunging as a wolf, but not reigning as a God, which in his own Temple he doeth: First I aske, what true church it is, whereof thus he spea∣keth, that the man of sinne Antichrist hath ben found raunging therein as a wolf. Secondly, note how now he understands sitting as God, to be reign∣ing as a God: vvhich here before he understood to be invading and de∣stroying. Thirdly, how that vvhich the Apostle calleth the Temple of God, he stil calleth the Temple of the man of sinne, Antichrists ovvn Temple, &c. Where in, vvhether he doe not use fallacie, let himself consider, & others judge. Finally, touching this Scripture, & this clause thereof, how ever he op∣pugne what we propound, let him yet obserue how others doe under∣stand and apply it. Whereof I will here giue but one instance. More may be produced hereafter. M. Calvin vvriting upon these vvords, in the Temple of God, noteth this:Calv. in 2 Thes 2, 4. By this one vvord is their errour, yea their slug∣gishnes, sufficiently refuted, who doe therefore account the Pope to be the Vicar of Christ, be∣cause he hath his fear in the church, howsoever he cary himself. For Paul placeth Antichrist no other vvhere, then in the very Sanctuarie of God. For he is no outward enemie, but an home∣bred or household enemy, which under the very name of Christ oppugneth Christ. But it is de∣maunded, how a denne of so many superstitions may be called the church, which ought to be the pillar of trueth. I answer that so it is called, not because it reteyneth all the qualities of the church, but because it hath somewhat remayning. Therefore I acknowledge it to be the Temple of God, wherein the Pope ruleth, but profaned with innumerable sacriledges. Calv. in 2 Thes. 2.4. And thus doe other the best vvriters both old and new understand this Scripture, of the Church of God, So as his opposition is not onely against us, but in deed against the best vvriters in all ages. And hitherto of the first consequence, which I inferred upon the understanding of this Scri∣pture aforesaid, vvhich more specially concerneth the Papists, and others likewise mynded thereabout. Another consequence also I inferred upon the same ground against the Anabaptists and such as incline unto them herein: Namely, that by the
Temple of God (spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 4.) understanding the church of God, it wil fol∣lovv, that Antichrist should sit in the church of God, and that therefore he is there to be found, and doth not wholly take avvay the church of God, & every truth & ordinance of the Lord, as Anabaptists, and such as are herein Anabaptistically inclined, would bear us in hand. To this he answereth, Neyther did the Divel take away vvholly every trueth and ordinance of God from among the heathens: but they reteyned many rites of Gods worship received from their Fathers, asAnimad. p. 70. before is noted. But vvhy now saith he not that the Divell took not away vvholly the church of God from among the heathens? Why leaveth he out this clause, vvhich he savv I mentio∣ned about Antichrist, that he takes not away wholly the church of God, &c. Is it because he can fynd no answer, and yet vvill not yeeld to the trueth: and therefore rather then he vvill not oppose, useth these shifts and slye conveyances: thinking that his followers vvil not obserue these sleights of his. Hovv ever it be, let the reader obserue, that himself seeth the hea∣thens haue not the church of God, as the church of Rome, vvhere Antichrist sitteth hath: and that therefore fetching his answer from the heathens, he doth vvholly leaue out this clause of the Church of God, which they haue not among them in their estate: and so in deed giues us the cause, whiles he would seem to oppugne it. And whereas he saith, the Divel hath not taken avvay vvholly every trueth & ordinance of God among the heathens: it is nothing to the purpose, seing they are not the church and people of God, under his covenant: neyther doe so enjoy any of them. Take an instance in one of the particulars which he mentioned before, where he said, that the heathens reteyne baptismes or wash∣ings among them: yet vvhen any of them leaue that estate, and come to the faith and church of Christ, they are to be baptized into the Lords name, and to receiue the seale of his covenant giuen to his church, vvhich they had not before. But so may not be done, vvith those that haue received baptisme in the church of Rome, or any other apostate churches, when they leaue such estate: because they are already baptized into the name of Christ, and haue in those Churches received the seale of Gods cove∣nant, which the heathens haue not: As I haue shewedPag. 27, &c. here before more particularly. And this is alwaies a sure ground and firme rule to be ob∣served, The Lord shevveth his vvord unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgements unto Israel: He hath not dealt so vvith any nation: and as for his judgements, they haue not knovven them. Psal. 147, 19, 20. That which (he saith) he noted here before, isPag. 94, &c. before ansvvered: vvhither I refer the Reader. And vvhere he saith next, that the Divel and Antichrist, so much as in them lay, and as stood vvith the safetie of their deceitfull kingdome, haue sought wholly to take a∣vvay the church and trueth of God, and to put lyes in the place: this is against him self: both implying that it vvas not vvholly done (which is the thing that vve say, and he oppugneth) and manifestly shevving that Gods goodnes and power superabounded aboue all the malice and iniquitie of the Divell and Antichrist: vvhich therefore vve should all obserue vvith thankfulnes to God, & not obscure or oppugne, as the Anabaptists & this man doth,
what they can. Besides that Gods goodnes and power did yet more ap∣peare, in nourishing the vvoman (his church) in the vvildernes, from the presence of the serpent, Rev. 12, 14. Like as before, the Lord measured the Temple and Altar and vvorshippers therein: vvhich were most inward and secret to himself: vvhenas he gaue the Court of the Temple (resembling the outward visible estate of the church) into the hands of the Gentiles, (the An∣tichristian apostates and persecuters) and the holy City to be troden upon by them: which Court & City notwithstanding vvere stil the Lords, though thus exposed & dealt vvith, for the time appointed. Whereabout I haue noted some fevv thingsPag. 128, 129, 130, &c. here before: which the Reader may make use off concerning this matter. Other things that might be observed there∣about, I doe not now enter into, or insist upon. For the last thing, which he alledgeth, out of that which I vvrote here∣tofore: euen in it also there is sufficient for confirmation of this matter against himself & for us, inasmuch as the apostasie of Antichrist the man of sinneAnsw. to M. Ja. p. 137. could not justly be accounted a mysterie of iniquitie, and truely said to speak lyes in hypocrisy, also privily to bring in damnable heresies, and to haue a shew of godlynes, if they did absolutely and vvholy depart from the faith, and not onely from some points thereof, &c. And hither∣to of the understanding of the Apostles vvords, where he speaketh of Antichrists sitting in the Temple of God, 2 Thes. 2, 4. and of the tvvo inferences thereupon, against the Papists & Anabaptists, &c. In all which, this man opposeth, what he can: thus chusing rather to strengthen such in their errors, then he vvill seem to haue erred himself, or cease to oppose us thereabout. Of Gods people in Babylon, spoken off, Rev. 18, 4. Next, I observedAdvert. pag. 59. here againe (as I had done before concerning the baptisme had in the church of Rome) that which is said, Rev. 18, 4. Goe out of her my people, and partake not in her sinnes, &c. Whereupon I inferred, that those words, my people, imply the covenant of God continued among them. For thus is the covenant taught and set down unto us in the Scripture, I will be your God, and you shall be my people. &c. This also he setteth to oppose in words, but confirmeth it in deed, though against his will. For vvhat doth he ansvver?Animad. p. 80. These very words (saith he) are taken from Ier. 51, 45. My people goe out of the midst of her: where by my people, the church of Babylon is not meant; but the Israelites, &c. Very vvell. But are not those words, My people, the words of the cove∣nant, as I said? And vvere not that people now in Babylon, the church & people of God, under his covenant? Had not that people also polluted the Temple of the Lord, and fallen into notorious idolatrie, apostasie, and other iniquitie, for vvhich they vvere giuen by the Lord into the hands of the Babylonians: and vvere they not still the Lords church & people, his vineyard, and heritage notvvithstanding? 2 Chron. 36, 14 — 20. with Jer. 12, 7 — 10. and 20, 4. Lamen. 1, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15. &c. Esa. 63, 10, 17, 18, 19. Is there not difference moreover to be put betweene the people of God in Babylon,
and between Babylon it self? How els vvill he make this speach and case in the Revelation, to accord with that other spoken of by the Prophet: from vvhence (himself saith) these very words are taken: if that there be not novv (as there vvas of old in Babylon of Chaldea) the people of God, under his covenant continued among them, in the mysticall Babylon of the Beast, whether it be applyed to the city of Rome, the throne of Antichrist and jurisdiction thereof; or to the apostasie of the church of Rome, vvherein the man of sinne sitteth and dominereth. Whereabout see morePag. 152, 153, 154, &c. here before. And to make this matter yet more plain, obserue moreover in the Pro∣phet Zacharie, how afterward he speaking of the same matter, and same estate of the people, saith thus: Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land ofOf Chal∣dea: which vvas north frō Iewry. the North, saith the Lord: for I haue spread you abroad as the four wynds of the hea∣ven, saith the Lord. Deliver thy self, O Zion, that dvvellest with the daughter of Baby∣lon. Zac. 2, 6, 7. Where marke first, hovv for those words of Ieremy, my peo∣ple, Zacharie here hath, O Zion: and then also, hovv plainely his speach sheweth, that Zion is in Babylon: not mount Sion it self vvherein the Tem∣ple was built, which was in the land of Canaan, but the people of God, the Ievves, that perteined to Zion: among vvhom when God set his Temple there, he said withal,1 King. 6, 13. Psal. 132, 13, 14 I wil dwel in the midst of you: shewing that the Temple was a token of his presence among them, & a band of the holy and mu∣tuall conjunction that vvas between God and them, whither they vvere bound to come to the worship of God, and thither to bring their sacrifi∣ces, &c. This Temple of God2 Chron. 36, 14, &c they profaned most sinfully, falling into idolatrie and apostasie, and committing many other abominations, for vvhich the Lord gaue them into the hands of their enemies, vvho slew many of them vvith the svvord, and captived others of them in the land of the North, in Babylon, &c. This people that had thus sinned, that was thus captived and punished, that dvvelt vvith the daughter of Babylon: the Lord still accounteth and calleth his people, yea he esteemes them to be Zion, which he chose, and vvhere he dvvelt: vvhom therefore (after he had a vvhile captived and chastised them in Babylon for their sinnes) he calleth from thence againe in his mercy. So then note here these particulars, concerning the point in hand. 1, That the people of God pollute his Temple, become apostates and idola∣ters, and are captived in Babylon. 2. That thus now Sion is in Babylon; & consequently the Temple of God (so to speak) the people of God the church of God, is in Babylon. 3. That yet still they are notwithstanding acknowledged by the Lord, to be Sion, to be his people, and so still to be un∣der his covenant, though they be in Babylon. 4. That the Lord calleth them againe from thence: by divers of his Prophets, & at sundry times: as may appeare by comparing together, Jer. 50, 45. and Zach. 2, 6, 7. with Esa. 48, 20, &c. 5. That when they vvere by the Lord thus called away from thence, yet they did not all come together at once, but some after other at severall times. As namely, that some (in the first yeere of Cyrus)
came out at the first vvith Zerubbabell and Ioshua: Ezra. 1, and 2, chap. and Neh. 7, chapt. who afterward being hindred for some time in the buil∣ding of the Temple, vvere encouraged againe to the vvork by the Pro∣phets, Aggee and Zacharie. Ezra. 3, and 4, and 5, and 6 chap. In which time againe Zacharie (about the second yere of Darius) called upon the rest, that yet remayned in Babylon, that they likevvise should come out from thence: vvhom still he acknowledgeth to be Sion, though yet they vvere in Babylon. Zach. 2, 6, 7. &c. with 1, 7. and 6, 10. and 7, 1. And some also af∣tervvard returned vvith Ezra, in the seuenth yere of the said Darius Ar∣taxerxes, Ezra. 7, 1 — 7. &c. Which isRom. 15, 4. 1 Cor. 10, 11. novv likevvise to be observed about the Lords calling of his people, and their comming, out of this other Baby∣lon: vvho (as the former) come not from thence together all at once, but some after other at severall times: and that in such sort, as there vvill be of Gods people yet called from thence, euen then when this Babylon (the City of Rome) shall come to be burnt with fire, and to be cast downe to the ground, never to rise up againe any more. Rev. 18, 4. with ver. 8, &c. Whereof (by other occasion) I haue spoken here also before:Pag. 138, 152, 153. and wil not novv further insist thereupon. Neyther vvill I enter to speak of other things, that might here be ob∣served: As namely, that he useth the terme of the church of Babylon (spea∣king of Babylon in Chaldea) vvhen eyther he meaneth the City of Baby∣lon, or speaketh not according to the Prophets speach here: but in deed useth colourable vvords to deceiue the Reader: as if now there had ben some other church of Babylon, besides the Israelites, the people of God, here spoken off. Jer. 51, 45. Also, that here he calleth the Israelites, Gods lost sheep scattered there, upon the mountaines and hils, whom first the king of Ashur had devoured, &c. vvhich may be referred not onely to Iudah, but to Israel also of the ten tribes: as may appear, by the Prophets words, Ier. 50.4, 17, 18, 19, 20. compared with 2 Kin. 15, 19, 20, 29. and 17, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c. So here then he acknowledgeth Israell to be Gods lost sheep, asvvell as Iudah: vvhomAnimad. p. 82. other where he denyeth to be the people of God, in their apostasie. And moreover, that he saith God vvill receiue them into covenant, whom he cal∣leth out of Babylon,or, We are become as they o∣ver whom from the be¦ginning thou bareft no rule nei¦ther is thy nam called upō them. if they obey his voice calling them out of her: as if they were not already under the covenant of God, being his people: or as if they could be the Lords people (as here the Lord himself acknovvledgeth thē to be) and yet not be under his covenant. The Iewes themselues knew better, when they vvere in Babylon, and thereupon grounded their re∣quests to the Lord, and prayed, saying, O Lord why hast thou made us to erre from thy wayes, and hardened our heart from thy feare? Returne for thy servants sake, the tribes of thyne inheritance. The people of thyne holynes haue possessed the land but a litle vvhile: our adversaries haue troden downe thy Sanctuarie. 'We are thyne, thou never bareft rule over them, they were not called by thy name. Esa. 63, 17, 18, 19. And againe, Thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us because of our ini∣quities: But novv, O Lord, thou art our Father: we are the clay, and thou our potter,
and we all are the work of thyne hand. Be not wroth verie sore, O Lord, neyther re∣member iniquitie for ever: behold, see vve beseech thee, vve are all thy people. &c. Esa. 64, 7, 8, 9. These and the like things I omit further to treat off. That which is said already, is ynough to cleare the matter sufficiently. But seeing there is re∣ference here to the alledging of ‘ this Scripture before; where also I in∣sisted upon these words (My people,) about the Baptisme had in the church of Rome, &c. there is a point or two of vvaight to be observed therea∣bout, vvhich being not spoken off before, and fitly perteyning to the mat∣ter novv in hand, I can not therefore omit here briefly to touch them. Thus then it is: Among other reasons touching the baptisme aforesaid, I used this: The Baptisme had in apostate churches eyther is a seale of the covenant of God, or not. If it be a seale of the Lords covenant, then sure it is true baptisme. If it be not, then see what great things will follow thereupon: As first, that they which haue no other baptisme but it,This clause he pas∣seth over, in his an∣swer. A∣nimadv. p. 71. haue not the outward baptisme that sealeth unto them the covenant of God: and therefore must with the Anabaptists get another, that they may be assured they haue the seal of Gods covenant of grace and salvation. Secondly, that there neyther haue ben nor shall be in Babylon any of Gods people under his covenant: which is contrarie to that is written, Rev. 18.4. where the Lord sheweth that he hath his people, whom by the words of his covenant he calleth thence, saying, Come out of her, my people, &c.This also he neyther mentioneth nor answe∣reth. And if these men wil say, that themselues are not of such people there spoken un∣to, then let them tell us, vvhen and how they came under the covenant of God: and let them al∣so shevv it without stablishing their ovvne righteousnes of works thereby. Thirdly, that the baptisme now had in apostate Churches is not ansvverable to the circumci∣sion had in the apostasie of Israell: For that circumcision (though had in apostasie) was true cir∣cumcision,All this which here fol∣lovveth to the end, he includeth in an &c. and a seale of the Lords covenant, to his people, and therefore needed not to be re∣nounced or repeated. But the Baptisme now had in the apostasie of the church of Rome, they say is not true baptisme, and so not a seale of the Lords covenant to his people now, as the other was then: therefore it must be renounced, and another that is true obteyned. And thus againe in this they make themselues (and would make us) straungers from the policie of Israell, as in the point of government also was observed. Neyther will it now help them to alledge those Scriptures, or the like, as we haue produced heretofore against the Anabaptists, to approue the reteyning of our baptisme had in Apostasie, without renunciation or repetition thereof: as namely, 2 Chron. 30 ch. compared with Exo. 12, 48, 49. Gen. 17.10— 13. Levit. 26.14 — 44, 45, 46. Deut. 4, 25 — 31. 2 King. 9, 6. and 13, 23. Psal. 78, 9 — 38. and 89.30— 34. Ezech. 16.44 — 63. & 43, 7, 8, 9. 2 Thes. 2.3 — 8. Rom. 11, 2 — 5. & 15.4. &c. For now it will be answered them, that in Israels apostasie they kept circumcision, which needed not be repeated, seeing it vvas true, and sealed Gods covenant unto them: but that these cannot so plead for the baptisme had in the apostasie of Rome, because themselues say, the baptisme of the church of Rome is not true baptisme, and so not the seale of Gods covenant to them which haue no other but it. Whereunto what they will answer, let them bethink themselues. And let them shew us, by what Scriptures they can approue their standing novv, who wittingly & wil∣lingly remayne without true baptisme, to seale unto them the covenant of God in Iesus Christ. Advertis. pag. 56, 57, This was part of my ansvver to these mens Articles concerning this matter. Whereunto vvhat answer this Opposite returneth again, may be seen in his Animadver. pag. 71, 72. Where novv by this occasion I thought it not amisse, here to vvish the reader to obserue, how this man being not able soundly to answer these particulars, shifts so about them (after his manner) as some of them he neyther mentioneth nor offereth to answer at all, though they be speciall points of vvaight, vvhich should not be omitted, neyther vvould be, if he could finde answer thereunto. For
example, this for one, If the baptisme had in apostate Churches be not a seale of the covenant of God, then they which haue no other baptisme but it, haue not the out∣ward baptisme that sealeth unto them the covenant of God, and therefore &c. And this for another, That if God haue not novv his people, that are under his covenant (though yet remayning in Babylon) and that themselues also were such heretofore, as there are spoken off, that then they would tell us, when, and hovv they came under the covenant of God: and shevv it also without stablishing their ovvn righteousnes of works thereby. Whereunto let the Reader see, if he giue any word of answer, but passeth it by, both unmentioned and unansvvered. Other such things let the Reader himself obserue here and other vvhere. And now that by this occasion I manifest these shifts and sleights of his: let his follovvers get of him (if they can) a sound ansvver to these particulars hereabout. 1. Seeing he denyeth the baptisme had in apostate churches, to be the seale of Gods covenant: that therefore he would shew, when & where him∣self and they received an outvvard baptisme, that sealeth Gods covenant unto them, &c. 2. That he vvould shevv, vvhether they were under the covenant of God, before they vvere baptised; or came under it since. If before, whe∣ther then both their parents and themselues were not under the cove∣nant of God, vvhich the Lord hath continued in apostate churches, not∣withstanding the defection thereof. If since, vvhen & hovv they came un∣der the covenant of God: And vvhere they received baptisme, (the Lords signe of entrance into his covenant) synce they came under it: Or vvhere ever they find in the Scriptures, that God ordeyned that men should first be baptized, afore they be under his covenant: Or that the people of God haue so vvalked, &c. 3. Seeing he yeeldeth not, that novv there are in Babylon the people of God, under his covenant; nor that themselues are such, vvhom the Lord hath called from thence: let him moreover in this respect tell both vvhen & hovv they came under the covenant of God: and let him shewe it also without stablishing their ovvne righteousnes of vvorks thereby: like as the Anabaptists doe, in this behalf. 4. That he speak novv also (being better advised then heretofore) whe∣ther the Baptisme received in the Church of Rome and other apostate Churches, be answerable to the circumcision had in the apostasie of Isra∣ell, yea & of Iudah also. And vvhether that Circumcision then were not, and this Baptisme novv be not, the Lords signe and seale of his covenant of grace, &c. Or if not, hovv then they can eyther soundly answer the Anabaptists; or conscionably approue their own standing, vvho witting∣ly and vvillingly remayne without the Lords signe of true Baptisme out∣wardly received, to seal unto thē Gods covenant of grace in Iesus Christ: And finally, hovv they can come to the Lords table, without the Lords signe of Baptisme first outvvardly had, but that they must needs fall into high transgression against God; and profanation of his holy things; to the provoking of his vvrath against them more and more, til they repent
and amend their vvaies. And that also the more, seeing they haue had so long and often vvarning thereof giuen unto them. These things (if they can) let them get him to answer by the word of God, syncerely and soundly; if they vvill vvalk conscionably herein, as they ought to doe. To us, they may see, he cannot answer them: but with sleights & evasions puts them of: persvvading the Reader that no∣thing is proved by us, vvhen any may see that nothing in deed is answe∣red by himself: but that sometimes he passeth by things vvholly vvhich should specially be insisted on and answered; sometimes where he would ansvver, cannot find any, but vvith glosing speaches caryes away the Rea∣der vvhat he can; and sometimes brings that (as he thinketh) against us, vvhich (being well observed) is in deed for us, and against himself. As may be seen in the last points novv treated off: besides the like in other here noted before, and that may be observed throughout his treatise. And hitherto of this point, concerning Gods people, and their being under his covenant, euen whiles they are in Babylon. Rev. 18, 4. Of Israell heretofore, and Christian Churches since, being in Apostasie and Defection. A further declaration hereof I tookAdvertis. p. 59. from the example of Israell. For having alledged, that those words, My people, imply the covenant of God, which is, I vvill be your God, and you shall be my people; I annexed thereupon, And so is Israell often called the Lords people, and is thus spoken off in the time of their apostasie, by the Prophets: 2 King. 9, 6. and 13, 23. 2 Chron. 30, 6 — 9. Hos. 4, 6 — 12. and 5, 4. and 14, 2. Amos 7, 15. and 8, 2, &c. Whereunto this opposite not finding what to answerAnimad. p. 81, &c. betaketh himself to his woon∣ted shifts and evasions, and thereupon ansvvereth, that vve proue not the Question. Where let the reader judge, vvhether the point in hand touching that phrase of Gods people to imply the covenant of God, be not proved by the example of Israell, and the Prophets use of that speach concerning them. And that so plainly, as this man himself is glad to passe over the Scriptures here alledged, vvithout insisting thereon. Moreover, the que∣stion here in hand being, concerning the Temple of God, spoken off 2 Thes 2.4. whereabout I alledged also that terme and estate of the people of God, spoken off Rev. 18, 4. he keepeth not hereunto, as he should: but fleeth to Babylon, there to seek some evasion, if he could. Of this vvoonted course of his in not keeping the Apostles vvords (the Temple of God) whereabout our question is, but in stead thereof using the termes of the Antichristian church, Babylon, and the like, I haue spokenPag. 144. here before: & need not repeat it. As also of the termePag. 129 Gentiles: by the sound vvhereof he would novv cary avvay the Reader, whenas heretofore (inDef. a∣gainst M. Sm. p. 12, 13, 14, 15. the very place here cited by himself) he could distinguish betvveene these Gentiles, and the Court of the Temple here spoken off: Rev. 11, 2, 9, 18. Where likevvise there isRev. 11 ch manifest reference made (in divers respects) not onely to Israell, but also to Iudah: Which may assure us, that these are
true & fit types also of the things here spoken of, concerning the church of Rome and other churches in apostasie and defection. For vvhich see here before, pag. 127, &c. And still remember, that the very terme of the Temple of God, 2 Thes. 2, 4. & Rev. 11, 2. besides all the other things follovv∣ing in the same chapter, teach the same thing undeniably. For vvhich al∣so see before, pag. 124 — 127. &c. His next ansvver is touching Israell it self: vvhere he laboureth to dis∣proue, what I alledged concerning them out of the Prophets: but yet medleth not with the Scriptures, vvhich I cited hereabout, and vvhich are vvell to be observed about the point in hand: besides that in his discourse (after his manner) he useth what other shifts he can, and falleth into sun∣dry errors, & great abuse of the Scriptures, as I haue more largely shevv∣edPag. 96. 97, &c. here before, treating of this matter, and of some speciall things con∣cerning Israell, which here he insisteth on more particularly. To which therefore I refer the Reader. And having now intreated already so largely both of Israell, and the church of Rome, & other churches in apostasie and defection, as the Reader may see I haue done: I shall not, for the residue of his treatise, insist upon eve∣ry particular from point to point. For so I might vvrite many books & volumes thereabout. And in this I haue already vvritten much more, then I thought to haue done, vvhen first I began it. For the rest therefore of his discourse, it shall suffice to note a few (of the many) errors, evasi∣ons, contradictions, and other such stuf, vvherewith his treatise abound∣eth throughout: leaving it to the Reader to esteem of them and the like, which he may obserue himself, as he shall find them for to be. Errors, evasions, contradictions. &c. 1. That the Temple of God, spoken off by the Apostle, 2 Thes. 2, 4. is no more Gods Temple,Animadv. p. 82. &c. then vvere Ieroboams Idoll temples in Israell, and Bels Temple in Babylon. Animadv. pag. 82. yet he told us but a litle before, that it was to be understood of Gods church and people, invaded and destroyed by Antichrist, as the heathens of old dealt with Ierusalem and the dvvellers therein. Ibid. pag. 80. Pa. 83, & 84, &c.2. That he maketh not onely Babylon, but the Beast himself, and the Church to be all one. Whereas the Scripture teacheth us again and again, to distinguish betvveen Babylon, and Gods people in it; betvveen Baby∣lon, and Sion in it, &c. as I haue shevved here before, out of Jer. 51, 45. and Zach. 2, 7. compared vvith Rev. 18, 4. & betvveen the Beast that is the man of sinne, and the church or Temple of God, vvhere he sitteth and tyran∣nizeth, &c. 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. with Rev. 11, and 13 chapt. Pag. 84 & 85, &c.3. That vvhereas I observed a tvvofold consideration of the estate of the church of Rome, and of Israell heretofore: one in respect of the trueths and ordinances of God still reteyned among them; another in respect of the mixture of their ovvn inventions & abominations vvithall: in regard of the one, to hold and acknovvledge the trueth and church of God there,This cause he omits. against the Anabaptists; in regard of the other to consider and
obserue their apostasie and Babylonish confusion, against Antichrist, &c. he doth not onely not yeeld unto it (vvhich thing alone is to much strengthning of the Anabaptists in their erroneous opinions and courses) but he blameth and oppugneth the comparing of the church of Rome vvith Israel: say∣ing, They doe but roll the first stone, saying the same things, comparing Antichrists church vvith Israell, vvhereas the holy Ghost compareth it vvithRev. 11, 2, 8. & 17 5. the Gentiles, euen the most vile, the Sodomites, Egyptians, Babylonians, and heathen Romanes, Pag. 84. The like he hath againe in, pag. 85, and often in his treatise. Where marke, not onely hovv he strengthneth the Anabaptists hands, but useth also the A∣nabaptists language and ansvver. When M. Clyfton, to approue the re∣teyning of baptisme received in the apostasie of our forefathers, al∣ledged the example of circumcision received in the apostasie of Israell: M. Smith then opposing, returned this ansvver,M. Sm. charact. of the Beast. p. 48. that the apostasie of An∣tichrist is deeper then the apostasie of Israell: for first (saith he) Antichristians are not called Israelites, but Babylonians, Egyptians, Sodomites, Gentiles, in the Revelatiō: where∣by the holy spirit of vvisedome giveth us to conceiue, that he doeth account the apostasie of Antichrist equall to Paganisme it self, yea to the very vvorst kind of Paganisme. &c. Novv let the Reader compare these together: and then let him consider vvhether M. Ainsvvorth doe not in deed plead the Anabaptists cause: and that also after their manner, and almost vvith their very vvords. As tou∣ching the point it self, I hauePag. 129 135. &c. already out of the Scriptures shewed, how the word Gentiles may here be understood, vvhich I need not repeat. Yea M. Ainsw. himself shevvethAnno on Psa. 59.6. & 54, 5 othervvhere (though now he forget it) that by this terme of the Heathens, David understandeth the Ievves, that were wicked and persecuters, &c. Psal. 59, 5. And the Prophets often compareEsa. 1, 10 Jer. 23, 14. Ezech. 16, 3, 45, 46. &c. Hos. 12, 7. Amos 9, 7 the Jevves to them of Sodome and Gomorrah, to the Canaanites, Ethiopians, Phili∣stines, Syrians, &c. Wil he therefore conclude hereupon, that they were not the Church and people of God? Not to speak, how the Scripture also de∣scribing the iniquitie of Antichrist, & the estate of the Church of Rome, and other Christian churches in apostasie, hath reference often to the estate of Iudah and Israell: as I haue shewed more largelyPag. 127. &c. here before. Which alone is sufficient to convince both M. Ainsw. and M. Sm. answers, and the Anabaptists errors hereabout. 4. He grants, that in Pauls time, the church of Rome was set in the way of God, and soone after fell into apostasie. Pag. 84.Pag. 84. & 85. And yet in the next page he saith the ordinances of God vvhich are still reteyned in that church, are stollen; as vvhen a thief steales a true mans money. Pag. 85. Wherein he contradicteth himself, & har∣deneth the Anabaptists. And is (in some respect) as if he should say, whē an honest man having money in his purse that is truely gotten, becom∣meth afterward a thief and stealeth some goods of other mens: the mo∣ney which he had before and still hath, is stollen money, because the other goods are yll come by, which he getteth afterward by unlavvful meanes. Or rather thus, as if he should say, that vvhen an honest woman becom∣meth an harlot, now all the goods vvhich lavvfully she had before & still reteyneth, are stollen goods. Thus if he vvere the judge, she should be
condemned not onely of adulterie, but of theft. And note moreover, that when a thief repenteth, he may not keep but must restore againe all the goods he hath stollen. Accordingly then by his doctrine, if the church of Rome should repent (as Iudah often did) of her adulteries; and when any of that church novv doe repent, and forsake that apostasie: they should not reteyn the baptisme & other ordinances of God, vvhich that church hath: but should presently part with them, and no longer keepe them, seeing they are stollen goods. How could you ever be thankfull ynough to M. Ainsvv. (O ye Anabaptists) for thus pleading your cause, if your opini∣ons were good, and his arguments and ansvvers sound thereabout. Pag. 85.5. The like errour and iniquitie he falleth into againe, vvhiles he mat∣cheth baptisme & the other ordinances of God reteyned in the church of Rome, with the feasts, worship and sacrifices of the heathen (Ephes. 2, 11, 12. who vvere with∣out Christ, being aliens from the common vvealth of Israell, and straun∣gers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and vvithout God in the world) yea matcheth these things moreover vvith the Divel himself, being transformed into an Angell of light. Pag. 85. What miserable assertions are these, and merely Anabaptisticall? Certaine it is, that the apostasie of the church of Rome, and iniquitie of Antichrist is extreemely sinfull: yet al∣vvaies we should remember in cases of apostasie (as in Israell and Iudah) to put difference betvveen the ordinances of God that still are reteyned in such estate, and the inventions of men that are taken up of themselues and mixed vvithall. Which this man not regarding, though it be shew∣ed him: vvhiles he vvould shun the gulf of Poperie, runs his leak bark upon the rocks of Anabaptistrie. P. 86 — 92.6. He maketh a large discourse touching Israel: wherein he hath ma∣ny truths: which vve also hold and urge. But yet notwithstanding he hath also some sleights, errors, & contradictions mixed withall: Where∣of take these for instances: I. That setting down my vvords, he omit∣teth some special clauses of waight: As namely, vvhen I speak ofAdvert. p. 60, and 61. a double consideration about the covenant of God made with his people: I declared it thus,These clauses he omitteth, Animadv. pag. 86. one in respect of the Lord himself, on the one part; the other in respect of the people taken into covenant by him, on the other part. Deut. 26, 17, 18, 19. Iudg. 2, 1, 20. And again, that in these tvvo respectsThese clauses he omitteth, Animadv. pag. 86. (sometimes having reference to God, sometimes to Israell) may there many things be observed to be spoken diversly. Pag. 87. &c.II. That he oppugneth this diversitie of consideration hereabout: whereof I haue spoken sufficientlyPag. 6, 111, &c. here before: Which double conside∣ration, vvhether it be not necessarie to be observed, for the right under∣standing of the Scriptures, and the estate of Israell and other churches, let the vvise of heart judge. As also, whether he doe not in some things speak so about the covenant, as may establish the righteousnes of works in some respect. Alvvaies remembring, that the covenant of God, wher∣of vve speak, is this, that the Lord said to Abraham, I wil be a God unto thee, & to thy seed after thee. And again, I will be your God, and you shal be my people. Gen. 17, 7. & 22, 18. Hos. 2, 23. Zac. 13, 9. with Act. 2, 39. & 3, 25. Rom. 9, 25, 26. &c
III. That the typicall estate of Israell, is our ensamples. 1 Cor. 10, 6, 11. Which,Pag. 87. vvhen we obserue or alledge, he setteth himself to oppose it, he will not admitte it, he excepts against it, &c. But for himself, he will use it, he will insist upon it; no man more: as in all his vvritings may be seen. And if he may doe it, may not we also? Came the word of God out from him? or is it come to him onely? 1 Cor. 14, 36. IIII. That he pretendeth and pleadeth as if he vvould perswade,Pag. 88. that God brake the covenant on his part vvith Israel, vvhen al the tribes were together, Pag. 88, &c. and yet aftervvard in the same page saith, that whiles Israell was one, they continued Gods Church. Pag. 88. V. That he shuffles together the estates of Israell,Pa. 88, 89, 90, & 91. when they were one body, and when they vvere rent in tvvo: Also, whilest Israell was in the land and presence of the Lord; and when they vvere cast out of his house and presence. Which I haue shevvedPag. 70, 71, 78, 101 &c. here before: and vvhich the Rea∣der may here again obserue, if he doe but note the Scriptures which now he citeth, and the cases spoken off, and the times vvherein they fell out. As namely, the things spoken off, in Deut. 1, and 2. Exod. 34. Judg. 1. and 2.Animadv. p. 88. 89, 90, 91. Num, 14, &c. when they were al together. And 2 Chron. 11. and 15. and 25. and 1 King. 13. Hos. 4. and 5. and 8. and 11. Amo. 9, &c. when the ten tribes had left Iudah: as also whiles yet they vvere in the Land. And finally, 2 King. 17. with Hos. 1, 9. and 2 chap. Jer. 3, 8. &c. vvhich speak of the estate of Israell, when they vvere cast out of the land, as out of the house and pre∣sence of God, and had the bill of divorce giuen them, that is here spoken off, &c. Which places, times, and cases, hovv he confoundeth, the Reader may obserue; and hovv needfull it is to distinguish them, may appear by the things themselues as I haue shevved more largely heretofore: pag. 70, 78, 101, &c. to vvhich I refer the Reader. Whereunto novv I annex this, that among other things,Pa. 82, & 91. the place in Hos. 1, 9. vvhich he cited before, and here again, might haue taught him better to consider hereof: both in respect of the severall times of the birth of the children there spoken off, vvhereof that of Lo-ammi, not my people, vvas the last; & because the Lord doth there expressely use a word of the future tense (I vvill not beor, your God: or for you, &c. yours) shevving that their case should af∣terward come to be othervvise, then novv it vvas as yet, vvhiles these types and prophecies vvere giuen them, and vvhiles as yet they vvere in the land. Of vvhich also, see more here before, pag. 77, 78. &c. VI. That he saith, if we cannot proue Babylon in Chaldea to be Gods church,Pag. 92. vvhen the Iewes vvere there captived, Ier. 50. and 51. we shall never proue the Temple of God spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 4. to be Gods true church. For about this, is our question and reasoning: hovv ever he please still to terme it, the Synagogue of Sathan, &c. Of vvhich, see here before, pag. 124, 143, 144. &c. And this Babylon (he knoweth) vvas then meerely an heathenish City & people, whereas the Temple of God here spoken of, himself acknovvledgethAnimad. p. 80. othervvhere to be understood of the church and people of God, answerable to Ierusalem and the dwellers therein. Animad. p. 80.
7. That vvhere I spakeAdvert. p. 62. of the vvord Church, being taken sometimes more largely, sometimes more strictly: which about the question (concerning the church of Rome) may likevvise be observed: he omittethAnimad. p. 92. this point, and doeth not so much as mention it: vvhether not willing to meddle with it, or not re∣garding it: vvhereas other both learned and godly men do obserue and note it. Keckerman vvriting of the church, saith, The church is taken largely, or strictly. The Church largely taken, is a company of men, that professe Christ to be their King, Priest and Prophet. And touching the Church thus taken, there be these generall rules. I. The Church is of those things, which haue one name, and divers significations, or, where divers things are signified by one word: which cannot be comprehended in one es∣sential and generall definition. 2. But the profession of the doctrine of Christ & acknowledg∣ment of his Propheticall Priestly and kingly office, generally and howsoever taken, is the forme of the church largely considered. 3. Thus therefore the Church being taken, conteyneth euen the reprobate and hypocrites, as members: to wit, so long as they prosesse Christ the Prophet, Priest and King any manner way. Keckerman. System. Theolog. l. 3. c. 6. p. 370. 8. Where I observedAdvert. p. 62, 63. a double regard, that may be had of apostate Churches in all ages, according as they are considered and spoken of, in comparison with other people of divers sorts. As namely, that Israell in apostasie, being compared with the Syrians, Philistimes, Moabites, and other nations are called & ought to be accounted the people of God, who haue the onely true God for their God, &c. 2 King. 5, 8, 15, 17. and 9, 6. &c. But being com∣pared with Iudah, which ruled with God, & was faithful with the Saints, she is called an harlot, not the wife of God, but an whore, committing adulterie, & compassing God about with lyes & deceit, &c. Hos. 2, 2, 5. and 4, 15. and 5, 3, 4. and 9, 1. and 11, 12. &c. And in like manner, that the Church of Rome in apostasie, being compared with the Iewes, Turks, and Pagans, they are and ought to be accomted Christians, and the Temple of God. Where also is verified that which the Apostle spake of Antichrists sitting in the Temple of God, 2 Thes. 2, 4. not the Temple of Ieru∣salem, as some to turne away the truth, haue imagined) but the Temple of Christians, the church of God, brought to the faith of Christ, and professing to be Christians: as may appeare by these Scriptures, and the like compared together. 2 Thes. 2, 4. with Ezech. 43, 7, 8. Zach. 6, 12, 13. Eph. 2, 11 — 13, 19, 21. 2 Cor. 6, 16. Rev. 11, 19.This clause he omitteth. and as it is also understood by all sound writers both old and new. But againe, being compared with the auncient Church of Rome and other primi∣tiue churches, in the Apostles times, and such as now walk in their steps and in the good & old way, ruling with God, and abiding faithfull with his Saints: she is called and is to be esteemed an harlot, the great whoe, the mother of the whoredomes and abominations of the earth, be∣leeving and speaking lyes in hypocrisie, giving heed to seducing spirits, and having pleasure in unrighteousnes &c. Rev. 17. 1, 5. 1 Tim. 4, 1, 2, 3. 2 Thes, 2, 3 — 10, 11, 12. And that thus there be∣ing in divers respects) a double consideration had of the Church of Rome novv, as of Israell heretofore, it will appeare how in one respect it may be said, there is the church of God or a true church there, and in another respect, there is an apostate or a false church there, as it is said of the same woman, that she is dead and aliue, in divers respects, 1 Tim. 5, 6.These also he mentio∣neth not. And of the Iewes, that they ar enemies in one respect, & yet beloved in another, Rom. 11, 28. So Iohn Baptist is Elias, & is not Elias, in divers respects. Ioh. 1, 21. with Matt. 11, 7 — 14. & 17, 10— 13. Iudas is an apostle, & yet a divel. Mat. 10, 2, 4. with Ioh. 6, 70. The Iewes are the children of Abraham, & yet the children of the divel: Ioh. 8, 33, 34. As the Prophets also called the Iewes, the seed of the wic∣ked, the seed of the adulterer, & a false seed, in one respect, when in other respects they acknow∣ledge them to be the seed of Abraham, Iacob & Israel, & so a true seed & people of the Lord. Esa 1, 4. & 5, 3, 4. with 41, 8. & 45, 19. & 58, 1. Hos. 2, 1, 2. & 4, 15. Esa. 63, 16, 17. & 64, 9. Ier. 31, 36, 37. Hos. 4, 6, 12. & 5, 4. & 14, 2, 3, 4. And endles it were to recount the many speaches & several consi∣derations of things thus spoken off in the Scriptures. Christ is without Father and without mo∣ther, Heb. 7, 3. and yet he hath Father and mother, Luk. 2, 48, 49. Ioh. 1, 18. and 2, 3. Christ was put to death in the flesh, but quickned in the spirit, 1 Pet. 3, 18. Abraham is unrighteous in him self, but righteous by faith. Rom. 4.3.5. The Apostle Paul, and all the regenerate serue the law of God, and the law of sinne: the one with the mynd, the other with the flesh. Rom. 7.25. Peter is a disciple and an Apostle, yet in other respect is by Christ called Satan. Mat. 10, 2. and 16, 23. A leprous Iew is a true man and an Israelite, but a corrupt diseased man, to be put and kept out of the host of Israell, till he be cleane. Lev. 13. and 14. with 2 Chron. 26, 20, 21. Numb. 12, 10— 15.
The Temple is the house of God, and yet is made a denne of thieues. Mat. 21, 13. The Empe∣rours of Rome, of Babylon, & the other nations are kings and higher povvers ordeyned of God. Rom. 13, 1. with Rev. 17, 10. & Dan. 7, 17. yet are they also in other respects Beasts, Lyons, Beares, Leopards, &c. Rev. 12, 3. and 13, 1, 2. with Dan 7, 3 — 6. So likewise the beast was, and is not, and yet is, Rev. 17, 8. And a number the like that may be observed in other places of the Scriptures compared together. M. Ainsvv. comming to answer, and treat of this double regard aforesaid,Animad. p. 92, 93, 94, 95, 96. setteth himself to except and oppose, vvhat he can: & finding the light of the truth herein to be so evident as it is, is driuen divers times to yeeld unto it: which yet he doeth in such sort, as euen then also he ceaseth not to except and oppugne after his manner: as the Reader in his treatise may obserue. Novv how needfull & profitable the consideration of this double regard is, both about this and other questions in religion, I leaue to the judgment of such as are of judgment and indifferency: and that it may the better be considered of, I haue here againe set it downe, as I did heretofore. Whereunto I will novv (having this occasion) annex this moreover, touching Israel, about the point in hand: That when Ionah was comman∣ded by the Lord, to goe to Niniveh that great city, and cry against it: it is saidJon. 1, 3. he rose up to flee unto Tarshish, from the presence of the Lord: that is (saith Piscator) out of the land of Israell: where the Lord dvvelt with his people. Piscat. in Ion, 1, 3. And that Ionah prophecied in Israel, among the tenne tribes, ap∣peareth by 2 King. 14, 23, 24, 25, 26. and vvas himself of Gath Hepher, a towne of the tribe of Zebulun, 2 King. 14, 25. vvith Josh. 19, 10, 13. Now by this may appeare, that Israell (being compared vvith other nations, as I noted before) had another consideration & estate in the account of God and his Prophets, then those nations had. Tarshish, vvhither Ionah novv would flee, is out of the presence of the Lord: as the phrase is here used and understood. Israell, from whence Ionah fleeth, is in the presence of the Lord. And so it is said in the historie, the Lord was gracious unto Israell (speaking of the ten tribes) and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant vvith Abraham, Isaak, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neyther cast he them from his presence as yet. 2 King. 13, 22, 23. As the same phrase like∣vvise is used touching Iudah, that through the anger of the Lord it came to passe in Ierusalem and Judah, untill he had cast them out from his presence, that Zede∣kiah rebelled against the king of Babilon. 2 King 24, 20. Jer. 15, 1. Whereupon Piscator also compareth this phrase vvith the like speach in Moses, where Cain said unto the Lord, from thy face shall I be hid: (Schol. in Gen. 4, 14.) as M. Ainsw. himself doth, vvith those words, And Cain went out from the pre∣sence of the Lord. In his Annot. on Gen. 4, 16. The like may be observed in Amos his speach to Amaziah, vvhere he calleth the land of Assyria a pol∣luted land, in respect of Israell. Amos 7, 16, 17. And yet in other respect, the land and people of Israell, not onely of the ten tribes, but of Iudah, & all the tribes of Israell together, is said to be polluted and defiled. Psal. 106, 38, 39. Jer. 2, 7. and 3, 2, 9. and 16, 18. Hos. 5, 3. and 6, 10. But of this and di∣vers other things, that may hither be referred, I haue spoken here before
more particularly. Pag. 61, 62. and 114, &c. Novv before I proceed to other things, it will not be amisse to shew what some others haue observed about this matter, concerning a divers consideration of the church: And namely, vvhat Keckerman (vvhose judge∣ment I shewed here before) vvriteth further thereabout. The church [saith he] largely taken is again considered, eyther distinctly with opposition to the heathen, or collectiuely in respect of Christians among themselues. The Christian church, if it be looed upon distinctly in opposition to the heathen, is the company of al those, which pro∣fesse Christian religion (or the name of Christ) in what maner soever, and separate themselues from the Turks and Pagans. And thus are all hereticks, schismaticks, and Arians, Papists, Ana∣baptists, and such lie, referred to the Christian Church. But in respect of Christians distinguished among themselues, the Church largely taken, is that which worshippeth Christ with a more pure or syncere profession of doctrine and the Sacra∣ments. And thus our Church gathered in France, England, Scotland, Low countreyes, County. Palatine of the Rhene, and other where, is calledThat is, of right faith or sound religion. the orthodoxe Church: and yet with a cer∣taine large extension: because not all who professe our right or sound religion, are elect, but there are also not a few reprobates and hypocrites vvithall. Therefore must we discerne and distinguish these degrees euen in this large signification of the Church: Namely, that it is eyther most large, or somewhat stricter: or finally the most strict, of vvhich we will now treat. The Church taken strictly and properly, is the company of those men, whom God the Father hath from everlasting chosen to eternall life, and in time effectually calleth them by his spirit, & gathereth them into the communion of his Sonne Iesus Christ, as being the true Prophet, Priest, and king, or head: and together also into a mutuall union of faith and loue among themselues. Hitherto Keckerm. in his System. Theolog. l. 3. cap. 6. p. 372, 373. This I thought here to insert, being such as may be of good use, for the better considera∣tion of the Church, in divers respects. Novv I will proceed to note a few moe of this opposites evasions, and errors, &c. Animadv. p. 93.9. Where he saith, the Turks acknowledge one God, and Christ to be sent of God with his Gospell, and to be the breath (or spirit) of God: what is this to the purpose, seing they doe not acknovvledge Iesus to be the Christ, the Sonne of God made man, that dyed for our sinnes, &c. as the church of Rome professeth, and divers of that Church haue dyed in testimonie hereof, against the Turks and Moores, &c. To make it yet more plaine, doth he think that the Turks make such profession of Christ, vvhereby any of them are saved in their estate? And againe, doth he think that none of the Church of Rome are saved by the faith of Christ, which they hold and professe in their estate? Not to speak of the church of England, of vvhich also, hovv these men esteem, is not unknowen. 10. Likewise, vvhen he saith, The Turks and agans are in some things to be justified,Pag. 94. in comparison of the church of Rome: hovv frivolous is this, and not to the purpose, for the point in hand? Sayth not the Prophet, that Ierusalem became so exceeding sinful, as she justified Samaria, & Sodome, in respect of themselues, and that they vvere more righteous then she? Ezech. 16, 46 — 52. Also, that the backsliding Israell justified her self more then tret∣cherous Iudah. Ier. 3, 11. Yea Christ saith, it shall be more tollerable for Tyre and Sidon, & Sodome, in the day of judgment, then for Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, where Christ lived, preached, & did miracles himself. Matt. 11.20— 24 Shall we therefore think, that Ierusalem and Iu∣dah, Chorazin, Bethsaida, & Capernaum, vvere not the cities, churches,
and people of God? Yet such reasons and arguments this man bring∣eth us. 11. Erroneous also it is and Anabaptisticall, that he saith,Ibid. The Temple of God, spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 4. is no more the Church and Temple of God, then the Divel which appeared to the witch at Endor, vvas Samuel, 1 Sam. 28.14, 15, &c. Also where I compared Ezec. 43, 7, 8. with 2 Thes. 2, 4. that this is not fit, but that the type should be set frō Bels Temple in Babylon, where the vessels of Gods true Temple were holden captiue (Dan. 1, 2.) or from the Samaritans Temple builded by Sanballat on mount Garizim, whither the apostate and wicked Jewes used to flee. Joseph. Antiq. Jud l. 11, c. 8. For let him speak, was the Divell Samuell in deed? was Bels Temple, or the Samaritans Temple, Gods Temple in deed? as himself said erewhile, that the temple of God spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 4. is to be understood of Gods church and people, answerable to Ierusalem and the dwellers therein. Pag. 80. Be∣sides that he knovveth hovv Augustine saith (in the place here before ci∣ted by himself) that the Temple of any Idoll or Divell, the Apostle would not call the Temple of God. August. de civit Dei. l. 20. c. 19. 12. Where I alledged Zach. 6, 12, 13. Ephe. 2, 11 — 13, 19, 21. 2 Cor. 6, 16.Pag. 95. Rev. 11, 19. and compared them vvith 2 Thes 2, 4. to shew, that by the Temple of God here, the Scripture understandeth not the Temple of Ierusalem, but the Temple of Christians, the Church of God: he turnes avvay from the point in question, what he can, & discourseth on things agreed upon by all. But to put him from his shifts, let him tell us plainly, when Paul saith, the Temple of God hath not agreement with idols, 2 Cor. 6, 16. if yet there be idols set in the Tem∣ple of God, (as was in the time of Manasseh, Antiochus, and others) whe∣ther now it cease therefore to be the Temple of God, or not. The Scri∣pture sheweth that it is the Temple of God notvvithstanding, as I haue noted before out of the historie and Prophets. 2 King. 21, 7. Jer. 50, 28. Ezec. 8, 5, 10, 16. Dan. 11, 31, 38. This is the point, whereunto he should keep, if he vvould ansvver to the purpose. 13. And againe extreemely erroneous and Anabaptisticall it is,Ibid. that he saith the Church of Rome hath notSuch is his opinion also touch∣ing the ba∣ptisme of the church of Englād. the true baptisme, the one baptisme, spoken off, Ephes. 4, 5. If this be true, what outward Baptisme then haue these men themselues? He saith, not a true one, not that one baptisme spoken of Ephes. 4, 5. And vvhat remayneth then, but that they must needs become Anaba∣ptists, and get another outvvard baptisme then that they haue, if they will vvalk conscionably: and that in the meane time they profane the Lords table, and all the holy things of God usurped among them? So eyther they must leaue their Anabaptistical opinions, or admit of Anabaptistical courses. Let them chuse, vvhich they vvill. And if they vvill not become Anabaptists, let them tell us, whether (in divers respects) a double consi∣deration may not be had of the church of Rome as of Israell heretofore, yea and of Iudah also: so as in one respect it may be said, there is the Church of God or a true Church there (to wit, as the Temple of God, and his people is there) and that in another respect, there is an apostate or a false Church there (namely, as Antichrist sitteth therein, with his apostasie, oppositiō, exaltation aboue
all that is called God, &c.) & whether moreover it be not good & need∣ful in such cases to obserue how the Scripture speaketh diversly of things in divers respects: vvhereof I gaue sundrie instances. Against vvhich though he vvould seem to except what he can, yet he doth directly yeeld unto it: and that so, as himself affirmeth here,Pag. 96. that things are often in the Scriptures spoken in divers respects, without observing whereof, men shal erre infinitely. Which vvhether he haue not done, in his plea about the Baptisme and Church of Rome, let himself consider, and others judge. 14 Whereas for a conclusion, I inferred, that if the things aforesaid & the like, about apostate churches, and the mixture of mans inventions with Gods ordinan∣ces in apostasie, be distinctly and carefully regarded, they may be (through the mercy of God) some good meanes to stay people from Anabaptistrie and other yll courses, by the consideration of the things that are to be observed on the one hand: and to bring men more soundly to separation from the apostasie of Antichrist, by the consideration of the things to be observed on the other hand. (Advertis. pag. 65.) this hePag. 92, & 97. passeth by: which both he and his followers had need to regard othervvise, then hi∣therto they haue done, if they vvil walk soundly & syncerely in the truth, as they ought to doe. 15. And whereas I noted, that I had observed and written somewhat tending this vvay, long since: as may be seen in the Answer to M. Ja. p. 7. where I spake of a double consideration of Christians, in one respect, true, and in another false: &c. him∣self knoweth, that then both he and his followers could well like of this manner of speach & distinction touching the same persons in divers re∣spects: vvhereas novv if like speach be used in some other respect or occasion, they can make no end of their outcries & evil dealing by word &P. 76, to 97. besides his letters &c. vvriting thereabout. If there were no other thing in them, but this their dealing, they might hereby consider with themselues, that some∣vvhat doubtles is amisse vvith them novv, othervvise then heretofore. But they know, we are acquainted with other things besides, concerning thē. 16. Moreover, vvhereas I noted, that in the book aforesaid, I had also vvritten of salvation now had in the church of Rome (Pag. 13,Pag. 97. and 47.) which necessa∣rily implyeth, the people of God, and his covenant to be there: because that whosoever are saved, they are the people of God, and under his covenant in Christ: he fynding no ansvver or cavill hereabout, saith now here, that they deny not, but there may be of the elect in all false Churches, euen as Sathan hath his reprobates in the true churches: And that he holds it presumption for any to limit God, by how smal meanes or measure of faith and knowledge he will saue a man. Yet here before he hath of∣ten affirmed again and again, that the church of Rome hath notP. 70, 71, 72, 80, 81, 95, 96, &c the cove∣nant of God; the covenant of grace; the people of God; the baptisme of Christ; the signe and seale of forgiuenes of sinnes and life eternall, &c. And hovv then should sal∣vation be had in that church: seeing there is no salvation to any that are out of the covenant of grace; no salvation but to the people of God; no salvation without remission of sinnes. Doth he not novv then eyther con∣tradict himself, or fall in deed into that presumption, vvhich he disclay∣meth in vvords? And mark vvithall, that though I speak expresly, of the
Church of Rome, and of the people of God, & his covenant to be there: yet he doth not thus speak or acknovvledge particularly of that church, but useth some generall words about the salvation of Gods elect: whether for an evasion hereafter; or for that already he perceiveth, if he should so speak, and acknovvledge it in particular concerning that Church, his contradiction vvould be more evident unto al; or for vvhat other cause, himself knoweth best, and time may manifest more. 17. Neither is this to be omitted,Pag. 97. that to haue the more colour & eva∣sion, he saith, God expressely said, when he made Israell his peculiar people, that yetExod. 19, 5. al the earth was his, which are the words (saith he) of the covenantEzech. 16 8. generally. And for this, he citeth Ezech. 16, 8. with Exod. 19, 5. But vvhat now is it that he meaneth hereby? If by the covenant, he meane the covenant of grace for salvation (whereof we treat) and think that all people of the world in all ages and places of the earth are under it; vvhat differeth this, from the opinion of the Anabaptists, and of the Arminians also, touching generall redemption? If he speak not of the covenant of grace, vvhich is for salvati∣on; all may perceiue he speaketh not to the point in hand. 18. And finally, how he useth or rather abuseth the Scripture herea∣bout, vvho can not discerne? The Lord by the Prophet (in the place which he citeth) saith to Ierusalem; when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, the time was the time of loue (that is, the time of mariage) and I spread my skirt over thee (taking thee to be my wife, under my protection) and I cove∣red thy nakednes: yea, I sware unto thee, and entred into a covenant vvith thee (to wit, the covenant of mariage) saith the Lord God, and thou becamest myne, that is, my wife) Ezech. 16, 8. Thus also the Lord hath dealt vvith the church of Rome: Rom. 1, 7. as himself acknowledgeth divers times in this Treatise, Animad. p. 84. and 98. &c. But is this novv the case and estate of all the earth with the Lord? Are al in the world become the Lords wife, church, and people, in the covenant of mariage, &c. Or vvas all the earth so, and did the Lord so intend it, vvhen he said to Israell, all the earth vvas his? Exod. 19, 5. Othervvhere the Lord saith, thatDeu. 10, 14. Psal. 115, 16. the heauen, and the heauen of heauens is the Lords: and thatPsal. 50, 10, 11, 12. every beast of the forest is his, and the cattell upon a thousand hils: that the vvild beasts of the field are his: yea that the world is his, and the fulnes thereof. Shall vve therefore think, that the heauens, vvild beasts, cattell, and vvhole vvorld, are the vvife and church of God, in the covenant of mariage with him, as Ezekiel speaketh of the Ievves, in the place vvhich here he alledgeth, and by vvhich he vvould perswade us, that these are the vvords of the covenant generally? But I vvill not follovv this any further: neyther the abuse that he hath of other Scriptures every where: which vvere endles to prosecute in particular. Onely let him consider with himself, how sinfull a thing it is, thus to abuse the vvord of God, and to take his name in vaine, as he doth throughout his treatise. For vvhich he may assure himself, the Lord vvill not hold him guiltles, nor leaue him unpunished, if he doe thus persist, and vvill not be reclaymed. Exo. 20, 7. Let him therefore not delay to think on his wayes,
and to turne his feet into the testimonies of the Lord. Psal. 119, 59, 60. 19. When as heretofore about this question concerning the church of Rome, vve annexed somewhat out of the vvritings of M. Iunius against Bellarmine: vve expressely signified,M. Clift. Advertis. p. 20, 21. that vve did it, not as relying upon the judgment of men in causes of religion, but because we knevv, that many who are caried with a prejudice against us, would stay themselues the more, when they should see what M Iunius hath written of this argument. Yet as if no such thing at all had ben signified by us,Animad. p. 98. this opposite doth not onely passe by it, but pretend as if herein we did or vvould stand to his judgment. And this also he maketh the more straunge, because sometimes some letters of difference haue passed betvveen M. Iunius and us in some other things. As if vve could not dif∣fer from him in some things, and yet like or speak of his judgment in some other. This man himself differeth from him in sundry things: doth he not therefore like, or may he not speak, of his judgment in any thing? But vvhat vvill he not pretend or except against, to haue some shevv of help for himself in such time of need? And although it be certaine, that in cases of Religion, vve should not rely on the judgment of man, but on the vvord of God alone (as we noted before) yet seeing that we knowe but in part, and the Word of God is common to all his people, and is not come to any person or people alone, therefore should we not lightly de∣spise or reject the judgment of others, and those also godly & learned, but with reverence and humilitie regard them: specially when they set them¦selues not onely to shevv their judgment, but to bring proof of argument, and that also frō the word of God, as M. Iun. doth about the matter in hand. 20. Novv therefore that the Reader may see hovv M. Ainsvv. setteth himself herein not against us alone, but against any other whomsoever, and vvhatsoever they alledge hereabout; and specially, that he may bet∣ter consider, what M. Iunius himself hath written of this matter; and how very many things therein of special vvaight and use M. Ainsw. hath omit∣ted, which are good and needfull to be observed: I haue thought it not amisse here again to set dovvn M. Iunius his ovvn words. Which alone wil much help the Reader better to discerne the evasions, errours, abuse of Scripture, and other evill dealing, into vvhich M Ainsvv. runneth on still more and more. Besides that the Reader may by this meanes be better informed and directed, hovv to discerne and judge of the opinions and differences that are at this day hereabout, among whomsoever, vvhether Protestants, or Anabaptists, or any other. M. Iunius his judgment of the Church of Rome: as may be seen in the second tome of his works in folio, Libro singulari de Eccles. contra Bellarm. cap. 17, pag. 1018, 1019. &c. BEing to treat of the Church of Rome, we will first open the aequivocation, or divers signifi∣cation of the word, before we determine of the thing it self, that all men may better per∣ceiue, what it is, that is at this day called in question among us. For very many ar deceived with the homonymie or divers signification of the very word, and unawares insnare themselues
and others, by ignorance of the deceitfulnes in the speach.] The church of Rome [therefore is properly so called, or abusiuely, by the misterming or ab∣using of the name, both as it is called a church, and as it is called the Romane church. For as it is called the Romane church,] sometimes it properly signifieth a company which is at Rome, as Paul spae, writing to the Romanes: sometimes it signifieth abusiuely, all the Churches on the earth, that cleaue to the Romane church, according to the forme of doctrine, and constitution thereof. But we will simply treat of the church, as it is the Romane church, or church of Rome: and the things which we shall speak of this church, the same may the godly reader by proporti∣on understand of the church so called by abuse of speach. [NowAll this whole pas∣sage he omitteth, and all o∣ther clauses sentēces & passages that are in∣cluded in these []. as it is called a church (vvhich thing chiefly is in controversie) it is so termed three ma∣ner of waies: as a subject, as an accident growen to the subject, and as the subject together with that his accident. As a subject, it is the simple or single church of Rome, As an accident growen upon the subject, it is the papacie, or the papal hierarchie, which they cal ecclesiasticall. As a sub∣ject compounded vvith his accident, it is the church of Rome become papall, or under the pope, that is to say corrupt, as I may so spea, by that lawles or unnatural shoot of the Pope, springing out of the stoe. Now of each of these we will consider so briefly as we can] The Church of Rome when it is considered as a subject, it hath two parts, the pastors and the flock of Christ: for which church the Apostle of old gaue thanks to God by Iesus Christ, because her faith was published throughout the whole world. Rom. 1, 8. [And for which we also dayly ask of God in our prayers, that he would informe it to worship him by his spirit in the Gospell of his sonne, & to stablish it in the faith.] Neither doe we deny this subject to be euen at Rome, [by the mercy of God,] at this day, because we trust there is God calling, persons called, & the calling it self yet in her: the meeting of which things together in one giveth being to a church, as before we shevved. But touching the papacie, or the papall hierarchie, which they are woont to call Ecclesiastical, we say that it is not the church properly, but an accident growen unto the church, and such as covertly worketh against the life, and health of the church. [That it is not the church properly,Here again he omits clauses, words & passages of speciall waight. is proved by the very definition of the papacie, and of the church of God.] For the papacie [ac∣cording to his generall] is an order: [the church is a companie or an assemblie. The papacie by his difference, is an order positiue,] humane or from men, and naught: The church is an assem∣blie divine or from God, [by divine authoritie united together vvith reason. Now those things which differ both in their generall, and in their essential difference, and in their necessarie condi∣tions or properties, they cannot be one and the same thing. And that the papacie is an accident growen upon the church, experience it self speaketh. For the subject is before his accident, which is contingent and separable: The church was many ages when the papacie was not: The papa∣cie came to the church contingently (beside the being of the church,) and so may be separated from it, as at this time also there are churches where the papacie is not, & there will be churches still hereafter vvithout the papacie. Therefore the papacie is not the church, but it is an evill growen up in the church, a pestilence, a dropsie, a gangrene in the bodie, deceitfully working a∣gainst the life and health of it, and therefore most dangerously & noysomely eating up the liuely and wholesome moysture of the church. But of this whole matter we haue spoen in the third controversie, and in this fourth we are to speak of it hereafter.] [Therefore concerning the other which remaineth let us se, whether the papal Roman church,This also he passeth by. or that which is of the pope, be the church. The opinions which are about this matter are divers. The popish generation cry out with full mouth, that it is absolutely the church. Others not be∣holding a different regard of the papacy, from that which is the church, deny it to be the church. We relying both on the nature of the thing, and on the authoritie of the Scripture, doe put a dif∣ference. The nature of the thing doth teach, that the church is one thing, and that the papacie is another, as we spake a litle before. The authoritie of the Scripture teacheth the church, but it teacheth not the papacie: therefore they are divers things. For they delude undoubtedly, I say they delude, which require at our hands one definition of the subject & of the accident, as of one singular thing, or obtrude it on us. For thus must we say, The papal church, as it hath that in it which belongeth to the definition of a church, it is a church: but as it hath in it the evill growen unto it, which we call the papacie, in that respect it is not a church, but a faultie or defloured, a polluted and corrupt church, and drawing on to destruction.] [Let us mae it plain by a similitude. The body it self is one thing,And this he omits. the corruption or consum∣ption in the body another thing. The body is the subject, the corruption or consumption is the evill accident cleaving unto the subject, the corrupted or consuming body is compounded of them both. There is both the body, and the consumption in the consuming body. So likewise
is a body that is svvolne with the vvater, causing the dropsie. Both are together, and yet so toge∣ther, as eyther one of the two, or both together must needs perish. If the nature of the body be stronger, the consumption ceaseth and the dropsie-water decayeth: but if the consumption or dropsie prevaile, there is most certain destruction of them both. So is the church of God: for in it self it is the bodie of Iesus Christ. If a deadly disease growe upon it, both are then together, the body and the disease in the body. If the purging medicine of the grace of God (for nothing is here naturall, be of the more efficacie, the disease then is vanquished and decayeth: but if the disease prevaile, then both of them (the body & the disease) must needs come to an end. For such is the condition of the disease: it both feedeth it self on the body decaying, and destroyeth it self together with the body.] And this also.[After this maner therefore doe we esteem of the church of Rome, which they cal the papal or popish church. There is the church, there is the papacie, and there is the papal church. As there is the church, it is the subject of God: as there is the papacie, there is the disease of man: as it is the papall church, there is a fight between the church & the papacie, that will destroy eyther one of them apart, or both together. If God shal giue it the purging medicine of his grace, by meanes whereof the papacie, the accidentarie evil decay and perish, it is wel: but if the papacie, that most faultie and corrupt order, and deadly accident prevaile, it wil bring destruction to both of them, both to the church and to it self, by the judgment of God.] And this.[And this now in the memorie of our fathers and our owne wee see to haue befallen many churches, which claue fast unto that Romane church. For when it seemed good unto God more clearly to light the torch of the gospell, & to scatter the papal smokes by his spirit, there remay∣ned churches returning by his grace to a better constitution and stronger health, and that which was of the Pope departed vanishing away of it own corruption: but when as God sent not that purging medicine of his divine grace into the body of any church, then the popish corrupt blood got strength more and more, which will be to that church deadly destruction, unles God of his mercie provide a remedie. In the remembrance and conscience of this benefit, doe our churches fitly sing vvith the Prophet, Blessed be the Lord which hath not giuen us for a praye unto their teeth. Our soule is escaped euen as a bird out of the snare of the foulers: the snare is broken, & we are delivered. Our help is the name of the Lord, &c. Psal. 124. [Wherefore in my judgment they speak preposterously, who ask whether the church be in the papacie:And these clauses al∣so. because on the contrarie it should be asked, whether the papacie be in the church. For the subject is not in the accident, but the accident in the subject, whose being is an in-being, or to be in a thing, as men commonly speak. And that] the papacie is in the church, as the order or estate of apostasie in the house and city of God, [is as certaine, as that of the Apostle is certain,] 2 Thes. 2. that the man of sinne, the sonne of perdition sitteth in the temple of God, with his whole order orOr, rank, in the for¦mer tran∣slation. estate of apostates: & not [on the other side, that] the temple of God consisteth in that order and number of apostates, which is a thing most straunge & furthest off. But the terme of the papacie taken doubly & aequivocally, deceiveth them in such sort, as here before we shewed concerning the Romane popish church. For under the name of the papacie (which is an order vitious & corrupt) they comprehend the subject it self, which is annoyed with that corruption, not distinguishing aright between these things.] [As therefore, if any should deny that to be a bodie,] which lyeth in a deadly sort swollen with the water of the dropsie,And this. [or should affirme that water vvhich choketh the body, to be the body it self, should in both these be deceived in his judgment: so also are both deceived, as well they which deny it to be the church, because the papacie is in it, as they which avouch the papacie to be the church it self, which vve haue before disproved.] The papacie is a poyson in the church, which poyson must needs be vomited out, if it will be preserved: or els the church vvilbe extin∣guished by it, if it suffer that poyson to prevaile, and possesse all the veynes of the bodie. [But how can she be the church, (will some say in which the papacie is? Euen so as there is the body,And this. in which a disease worketh. But because the papacie is a deadly corruption, the more that the papacie getteth strength, the more the church is weakned: the increase of the one, is the decrease of the other. And hence it commeth to passe, that in the churches which are called po∣pish, some are more healthie, and some more unhealthie then others: the more healthie are those which haue lesse of the papacie, and more of the church: and those are the more unhealthie which haue more of the papacie, and lesse of the church: & of this kind, I doubt not that church to be, which at this day is at Rome.] For it had long agoe giuen up the ghost, if God by the medi∣cine of his grace and long suffring had not nourished and kept it warme. [Notwithstanding that we may giue content unto their minds, which doe not yet reach unto these things,And this. or think that they are more subtily then truly spoken of the church which they call
the papal or popish church: let us answer this question in few words, from the regard of al parti∣cular churches, as they are among mē, or in consideratiō of things humane. Everie church, which in deed is a church, is considered two waies, on Gods behalf (as they speak) & on our behalf.] On Gods behalf, it is altogether a church, whersoever there is found a companie called of God, with his calling by the spirit & the holy Scripture, & the ministerie of persons ordeined for holy things & divine actions. [On our behalf, there is no church at al, (although it be so of God,And this also. as we haue said) to which there doth not cleaue corruption, concerning the persons, things, actions, and fi∣nally the whole ministration of man ordeyned by God. Now that which is on Gods part, is not taken away by our default, so long as it seemeth good unto the Lord, to acknovvledge it for his church, and call it by his calling, by the spirit, and holy Scripture, and the ministerie. For shall the unbeleef of men, (saith the Apostle Rom. 3, 3.) make the faith of God without effect? shal the weaknes of man make voide the truth of God? or his imperfection the perfection of God? Far be it off: yea let God be true and everie man a lyer, saith the Apostle in the same place.] We wil make the matter plain by an example & similitude out of the words of Ieremie, ch. 3. A wife being filthie with adulteries, if her husband will pardon her, and consent to receiue her,And these clauses he passeth o∣ver. and to dwell with her, she abideth still the wife of her husband, [not in deed by her own fact (for she hath broken wedlock, what in her was) but by the benefit or goodnes of her husband.] So a church overflowing not onely with lighter infirmities, but also with grievous adulteries, [should cease in deed on her part to be a wife, but she ceaseth not on her husbands part.] For touching the election, as the Apostle saith, Rom. 11, 28. she is beloved for the fathers sakes, speaking of the church of the Iewes. [It is a church so long whiles God calling her, proclaymeth that which is in Ier. 3, 13. Onely acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God,And these following. & hast scattered thy waies to the straungers under everie green tree, and ye haue not obeyed my voice, saith the Lord. Turn, O backslyding people, saith the Lord, for I am maried unto you, & I wil receiue you &c. It is a church so long, whiles God with protestation calleth upon it departing from him & being rebellious, as it is in Esa 50, 1. Where is the bil of your mothers divorcement, wherewith I put her away? or who is there of my creditors to whom I sould you? &c. The church then at length ceaseth to be a church, whē God ceaseth to cal it back, & taketh away the evidence of that holy marriage, that is, the holy Scripture, out of the hand of the adulteres, and her that is stubburne, testifying that the matrimonie is dissolved on his part, & so receiveth the covenant of grace to himself. It is not for any man, to deny that to be a church, which God calleth a church. Neither is it for any man, to cal that a church, which God, having giuen the bil of divorce, & ta∣ken away the draught of the mariage contract, denyeth so to be.] And after this maner doe we esteem of the church in which the papacie is. God calleth her with his calling, by his spirit, & word, & the publike records of that holy mariage (which we cal the holy Scripture) & the ministerie, & holy things, & actions,And this also. which before we haue briefly rec∣koned up. [These things doe remain to that church most manifestly, on Gods behalf. But in that on the behalf of men al these holy things & actions, together with the very persons themselues, abound & overflow, with most grievous & deadly corruptions, this is the sinne of men, not the fault of God, whose grace & truth is perfected in infirmitie On Gods part, she is yet called Ham∣mi, my people, & Ruchama, finding mercy, which most truly on her part, may be called Lo ham∣mi, not my people, & Lo ruchama, not obteyning mercie, as we read in Hoseah the Prophet. But we rely upon the mercy of God, and according to his grace revealed, we speak our mind, or deli∣ver our sentence concerning a church erring and going astray.] [But this church hath every thing in it corrupt. I cōfes it. But] in that it hath al the divine things in the Scriptures, it is of God: in that it hath thē al corrupt, that is of it self;And this. in that it hath al the di∣vine things, it is a church, in that it hath the same al corrupt, it is a corrupt church. The church is not takē away by corruption, unles it be total (as they speak) which they cal destructiō.And this [A corru∣ptiō that is in part doth not take away a church, but wekē it. The church of Rome hath al things corrupt, but not altogether: this is not a destructiō, but is to be called a corruptiō of it in part.] [For to prosecute these heads particularly, which we haue briefly noted in the consideration of the church God by the alone presence of himself calling, doth lay the foundatiō of the church,And this whole pas∣sage he o∣mitteth. in Christ the head therof. The church of Rome addeth another foundatiō to this foundation, & to this head another new head (wherupō it is called papal or popish) wherin it may likwise rest with al. The calling is to God alone, in the church of Rome there is calling to others with God, & the calling upō thē. There the calling is by the spirit & Scripture alone, whence it receiveth the mi∣nisterie, & delivereth nothing more, then that which it hath received from the Lord: here it re∣ceiveth a ministerie from the spirit of Christ, and of the Pope, from the Scripture, and the rag∣ged traditions of men: there finally the persons, things and actions are caried, according
to the doctrine of the spirit, and the Scripture onely: here all things are taken and exercised out of the Popes changeable shop, and at his beck (as they say) they stand and fall. So all the marks on Gods behalf are in it: but for it self, on it own part (as they say) there is no mark intire, no marke that is not corrupt by the papall poysonfull sorcerie, and the order of all things most mi∣serably perverted. For which cause in Lyons in France, a certain Frier did merrily preach to the people, when he sayd the Hugonots (for so they are called in France) did consent with the church of Rome in all their articles of saith, but there was one shrewd word, the word [Onely,] at the crack whereof war was in indled, for they beleeue onely what the rule of faith hath out of the holy Scriptures: but the church of Rome requireth more unto faith then is eyther conteyned in the rule of faith, or in the holy Scriptures, because such is the authoritie of the church.] And this also.[These things being well understood, all men will easely perceiue how that Church, in respect of God or on Gods part, is yet a church: but of it self is most corrupt, and verie neere to destru∣ction. But here doe arise two doubts and difficulties, by which the minds of many are troubled. The first doubt is, what we are to judge of the members of that church: The latter what the du∣tie of them is who are in that church, and see the great corruptions thereof.] [To the first question we answer on this manner, A threefold judgment had need meet toge∣ther in this cause:And this. the first, of trueth: the second, of charitie: the third of prudence or wisdome. The judgment of trueth is of the common condition of the church, by which we judge from the calling of God, that as yet she is a church. The judgment of charitie is of the severall members of the church, by vvhich we presume they be members of the church, whiles they be called with the calling from God, and are in this way, as David calleth it Psal. 2. The judgment of prudence or wisdome, is that by vvhich we discerne and distinguish persons, things & actions, divine from humane, good ones from evill, true ones from false, and the degrees of these also amongst them∣selues. For as of things and actions, so also of persons some are corrupting through ignorance infirmitie, or malice wholly, or in part others are corrupted, euen in the simplicity of their hearts as the Scripture speaketh: and of these there are a great number, of whom it were ungodly to esteeme that they were not of the church of God. Of such as doe corrupt we must take heed, Mat. 7. of the corrupted, who are corrupted yet still, we must haue compassion. But the Church verely is not to be judged of the maner of either of these: for Christ saith not, ye shall not know the church; but, by their fruits, of doctrine and life, ye shall know them, Mat. 7, 20. And without doubt, they doe very unwisely who judge of the trueth of a church, by the particular life or do∣ctrine of any men, who ever they be, especially of private men: for the calling of God maketh the church, not the assenting answer of the men that are in it: as on the other side the Church ceaseth not to be a church for the refusall, or deniall of men, wheresoever the calling of God is. Now let us come to the second demaund.] What is the duetie of those (wilt thou say that are in the popish church, and see the grievous corruptions of it?And some clauses here Their dutie is such as of those children, which dwel together with their adul∣terous mother: [for God hath used this similitude in Esay and Ieremie, as we haue seen before] A wise sonne vvill euen from his heart abhorre the sinne of his mother, he will with speach and signe call back his mother from evill, and he will absteine himself from it: and in all things he will cleaue to his father, [he will stand to his judgment, he will obey his will: and while he can by reason of his mother, he will cleaue unto her, next after his father: but when and whiles by reason of her he can not doe it with good conscience, for the spiritual and bodily injurie of her,] he will betake himself into the chamber of his father,Closet, or inner room. [where also is the church the mother of us all. Gal. 4, 26. For this is not a good consequent, if one depart from this or that church, therefore he doth altogether depart from the church. He doth but trifle that doth so from a particular, con∣clude universally. A part of the flesh if it be divided or cut asunder from another part by a wound received, is not straight way to be thought to be separate or cut of from the whole body: for it is cut asunder, and the mouth of the vvound openeth, but neyther part is therefore disjoy∣ned from the bodie. A godly sonne therefore ought to cleaue to his father and mother jointly, so long as with good conscience he can: but because he cannot with sound faith and conscience haue fellowship vvith the unfruitfull works of darknes, Eph. 5, 11. he rather leaving his mother, cleaveth to God his father, and our Lord Iesus Christ, then that he vvill defile himself with those foule deeds of his mother.] And these passages following to the end,[And this did our auncestors religiously, whom the popish tyrannie for some ages hath exer∣cised. The godly which were at Rome, and other where in the Church which they call the Ro∣mane church abusiuely, first learned to abhorre euen from their soule, the sinnes of their mother, when once they began to haue right understanding; by words and signes they modestly called her back from her naughtie deeds, whiles she would beare them, they carefully absteyned them∣selues
from all communion of evill, yet in all things cleaving to their father, from whom, in whom, by whom, and for vvhom are all things, standing to his judgment, and obeying his will: finally they did so long cleaue to their mother next after their father, vvhilst by her they could so doe with intire faith and conscience, and their owne salvation. But when they could not longer with good faith and conscience so doe, by reason of the violent tyrannie, & the spirituall & cor∣porall injurie of their furious mother, then being ashamed of her shamefulnes, and resting si∣lent, they betooke themselues into their fathers bosome and his inner roome, albeit that she pur∣sued them outragiously: least they being ashamed of her, should be said to shame her, as stum∣pets are usually woont to doe.] [For vvhich causes, I doe humbly beseech God the Father of our Lord Iesus, that he would both by his saving calling informe, direct and care for his church, and whatsoever belongeth to his church, & that he would also teach every one that is in it his truth, & the truth of his church: and that he would so work, as they wisely absteyning from all evils, especially from those which the sonne of perdition, and author of the apostasie hath brought in, and taking heed of the spirit of lyes, and the efficacie of his errour, they may religiously cleaue unto the Father and his good things, in everie of them, & to their mother next after the father (or so far as she accordeth with the Father:) that increasing in his truth, pietie, saith and loue they may bestow & employ al their studies to the edification of the church, the salvation of all, and the glorie of that our heauenly Father. &c. God the Father and the Lord Iesus Christ, by that eternall spirit of his eternall truth, bring to passe, that the wiles of Sathan being driuen away, we may al grow dayly in Christ, in the church, and in the truth of Christ and the Church, and that we may more and more confirme one ano∣ther in loue unfayned, to his glory and the common salvation of us all. Amen. Hitherto M. Iunius: who though he be dead, yet liveth and speaketh sufficient in this writing, for the point in hand. Which vvhiles M. Ainsw. would seem to ansvver, it is straunge (but good to be observed) how ma∣ny things of waight he passeth over; besides that sometimes he picketh out a sentence here, and a sentence there, & leaveth out vvhat commeth betvven; which should help the Reader, and more cleare the matter: thus being injurious herein both to the living & the dead: not to speak of the unspeakable abuse of Scripture also, into vvhich he falleth still more and more: which the Reader shall doe vvell to obserue, though I insist not upon the particulars, which would be endles: and being now purposed here onely to note a fevve things moe, vvhich he hath, that are merely Anabaptisticall, and full of glosing deceit. 21. Speaking of the Church of Rome, vvhereas he should distinguish be∣tvveen the Temple of God, and Man of sinne, spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 4.Animadv. p. 98-102. &c. he eyther regards not to obserue it; or confounds them together as one, without distinction; or so speaketh of Gods Temple & church there, as if it were no other then the Divels, spoken off Rev. 18, 2, 3. & 16, 14. then Sodome, Egypt & Babylon, Rev. 11, 8. and 16, 19. the lothed of God, delivered to Sathan, to be sedu∣ced, deluded, damned, 2 Thes. 4, 8.9, 11, 12. And hovv then is there the people of God, the Temple of God, the baptisme of God, the covenant of God, the salvation of God to any in that Church, &c. Betvveene these things, there is no just proportion: for what concord hath Christ vvith Beliall, or the Temple of God vvith idols or divels? 2 Cor. 6, 15, 16. 22. Speaking of the congregation of Saints that was at Rome in Pauls time (he saith not, as he might, that it is since corrupted, adulterate, or fal∣len into defection, &c. but) he saith absolutely, it is gone long since, and the
man of sinne with his worshippers come in the place.Pag. 98. So then here againe let him tell us, vvhether he thinketh these be the Temple of God, the people of God, under the covenant of God, having the baptisme of God, which the Lord hath ordeyned and giuen to his Church; or vvhether there be no such there at all, though corrupted and abused, &c. 23. WhereasSee here before, pa. 183. M. Iunius spake of Gods church, being euen at Rome at this day, by the mercy of God, because he trusted, that [there is God cal∣ling; persons called; & the calling it self yet in her: the meeting of which things together in one giveth being to a church, &c.] M. Ains. not having vvhat to ansvver hereunto,Animadv. p. 98, 99, doth very boldly, & without limitation or re∣streynt, deny that God is there calling as in his church, but that the man of sinne sits there as God, calling all to worship him, and that his calling is by the working of Satan, and in all deceiueablenes of unrighteousnes among them that perish; 2 Thes. 2, 9, 10, 11. All vvhich together (saith he) giveth being to Antichrists church, but not to Christs. Animadv. p. 98, 99. Thus (after his manner) still he termeth that Antichrists church, which the Apostle calleth the Temple of God. But omitting this, if it be as here he saith, hovv then hath there ben or can there be salvation to any in that church, since the man of sin sate there: vvhich himself thinketh vvas sone after Pauls time. Pag. 84. How also should any of that church become Martyrs, & vvitnesses of the Christian faith, against the professed enemies thereof? And how should any Ievves or Pagans be converted to the faith of Christ, by any of them? Or doth he think, that no such thing is had or done at all by them? Besides, if novv an Anabaptist take up M. Ains. own vvords, and where he speaketh of calling, apply it to baptisme had in the church of Rome, say∣ing thus as M. Ains. doth here, I deny that God is there baptizing as in his church, but the Man of sin sits there as God, baptising all that vvorship him, and his baptising is by the vvorking of Sathan, and in all deceiueablenes of unrighteousnes among them that perish; and the persons baptized, are deluded to beleeue lyes. 2 Thes. 2, 9, 10, 11. All which together, giue being to Antichrists baptisme, but not to Christs: what now wil M. Ainsvv. ansvver hereunto, but that eyther he shall contradict himself, or fall into more errour hereabout, to the further hardening of the Anabaptists in their erroneous opinions and courses. Pag. 99.24. That which M. Iunius applieth (and fitly) to the popish Hierarchie: M. Ainsvv. applieth to the church of Rome, and the whole church there: Yea though himself aftervvard acknowledg, that the popish ecclesiastical hie∣rarchie consisteth of Bishops, Priests, and ministers, pag. 100. besides whom, there are the people: as himself also noteth in the other page aforesaid. Pag. 99. 25. WhenSee here before, p. 183. M. Iunius (for more clearing of the point) purposely distin∣guished between the papacie, and the Church: shevving the difference be∣tween them, both in their generall kind, and in their peculiar difference: namely that the papacie is an order or estate, humane & evill: the church a com∣panie or assemblie,Animadv. p. 99, &c. divine, and by authoritie of God knit together: &c. M. Ains. fin∣ding no answer hereunto, purposely passeth over divers vvords, clauses, sentences, and vvhole passages, vvhich would giue light to the matter in
hand: and not content herewith, makes much a doe about a word (a rank of apostates) urging it contrarie to M. Iunius his meaning, hovv ever it be understood. For first, although the Translator in this place used two vvords (an order or ranck of apostates) yet he might see M. Iunius his word was but one, signifying an order or an estate of apostates, as before he spake of an order or estate of apostasie. Which vvord also the Translator here kept and joyned with the other. But novv this word of an order or estate, so fitly opening the point in question, and not leaving such colour of exception or aequivocation, as M. Ains. seeketh after: he leaveth it, and taketh hold on the other. A sleight and silly course. But (as himself said erevvhile) what vvill not men doe, for help in time of need? As for the word (ranck) it also is used in our tongue, for an order, estate, conditiō, estimatiō, &c. As in Psa. 53, 13. where David speaking of Achito∣phel, or the like, saith, But it was thou, a man according to my ranck, as the new Translators haue it in the margent: for which they haue in the text, a man, mine equall; and M. Ainsw.In Psal. 55, 14. in his translation and notes, O man esteemed of as my self, or according to my order, or estimation, &c. vvhere novv obserue these things, for the more clearing of this matter: 1. That the vvhole church or common vveale of Israel, Priests and people, vvere not of the same or∣der, ranck, or estate, vvhereof David and Achitophel vvere. 2. That the or∣der or ranck there spoken of, was to be distinguished from the persons themselues othervvise considered. Both vvhich M. Iunius observeth here, and M. Ainsvv. confoundeth or perverteth what he can. 3. That where the other Translators use the word ranck, M. Ainsw. useth the vvord order: cleane contrarie to his dealing here, vvhere he leaveth the word order or estate used both by the author and Translator, & layeth hold on the word ranck. And vvhy so? That let M. Ains. tell us himself: unlesse vve should think that he did it, because the vvord ranck in our tongue, doth some∣times also signifie that vvhich is or grovveth thick together, as corne in a field, or the like; and so is applied to persons or things in this behalf. So as thus a ranck of apostates may be understood of a companie of apostates, and those also thick together: vvhereas M. Iunius, about this question, put∣teth difference purposely betvveen an order or ranck, and betvveene a com∣panie or assemblie: making the one the general of apostasie, and the other the general of a church: and so shevving that the apostasie, and church of Rome, are tvvo different things, and diversly to be considered. Which vvhiles M. Ainsvv. vvill not regard as he should, but consound or abuse, what he can: let others judge what vain a doe he maketh here∣about, and hovv yll in this behalf he dealeth vvith M. Iunius. And this the more, seing that alsoSee it here be∣fore, p. 184 in the very next sentence to one of them which M. Ainsvv. here citeth, M. Iunius himself shewed the fountaine and occasion of this deceit, how ever M. Ain. (after his maner) passeth over it: namely, that the terme of the papacie taken doubly and aequivocally deceiveth men in such sort (saith he) as ” here before we shewed touching the Romane popish church. For under the terme of the papacie (which is a vicious corrupt order) they comprehend the subject
it self, vvhich is annoyed with that corruption, not distinguishing aright betweene these things, &c. Which how true it is found in M. Ain. not onely in this passage, but throughout his treatise, is so evident as I need not stand further to shevv it. Every page, yea almost every sentence, is a vvitnes and demon∣stration thereof. Or if in this place, by an order or ranck of apostates, we understand also a companie of apostates (as in the next clause follovving there is a vvord of number, that may be taken to imply so much:) yet any may perceiue that M. Iunius here speaketh this, not of the vvhole church, as M. Ains. urgeth it; but onely of the papall ecclesiastical hierarchie, asPag 183 &c. othervvhere in this treatise he calleth it. Which is evident by the very vvords themselues, vvhich are these:Pag 183 &c. And that the papacie is in the church, as the order or estate of apostasie in the house and city of God, is as certaine, as that of the Apostle is certain, 2 Thes. 2 that the man of sinne, the sonne of perdition sitteth in the Temple of God, vvith his vvhole orderA the o∣ther tran∣slation had it. or rank of apostates: and not on the other side, that the Temple of God consisteth in that order & number of apostates, which is a thing most strange & furthest off. Where marke two things, for clearing the point in hand: First, that M. Iunius ex∣pressely distinguisheth between the Church or Temple of God it self, and be∣tvveene the man of sinne that sitteth therein, with his whole order or estate of apostates: Secondly, that here, by this order or rank of apostates (spoken off) he understandeth onely the popish hierarchie aforesaid, and not the vvhole church or Temple of God it self: vvhich he saith were most strange and is furthest off. Novv though he speak thus plainly & expressely, yet M. Ain. vvill not regard it as he should, but taketh and urgeth it so, as he heareth M. Iunius himself say, is most straunge and furthest off: vvhether from the truth it self,Advert. p 60— 65. & here, p. 171. &c. or from the Apostles meaning; and so also from his own; it com∣meth to a like end for the point in hand. Yea and moreover, if this phrase of a rank of apostates, be applied (as by M. Ains. it is) to the whole church, Priests and people: yet we must stil remem∣ber the divers consideration of churches,1 Kin. 13 28, 30, &c Hos. 5, 1, 2 &c. & of their estate in this behalf: as both M. IuniusSe before p. 185. &c in this treatise observeth, and we haue also noted * be∣fore. If we looke upon Israell, eyther on the ten tribes, or on Iudah also, when the Kings & Princes, Priests and people, were fallen into apostasie, forsaking the Lord,2 Chr. 33, 2, 9, 10. er 1, 16.18. & 5, 30, 31. and 7, 17, 18. & 44, 15, 16, 17. &c. and burning incense to other Gods, &c. vvill not M. Ains. say of them (as here he doth, of the church of Rome) that now the whole church of Israell and Iudah, Priests and people, vvere a ranck of apo∣states. But will he therefore conclude thereupon (as here he doeth) that they vvere not then (in other consideration) the Church of God, the Temple of God, the people of God, that they had not true circumcision, nor the covenant of God, &c. yet thus he concludeth about the Church of Rome. 26. Likewise when M. Iunius accounteth the papall hierarchie as an acci∣dent grovven upon the church,Animadv. p. 99. 100. M. Ains. mentioneth the word (accident) as being desirous to take hold thereon, but medleth not with M. Iunius his reasons, being not able to giue answer unto them. That the papacie (saith
M. Iunius)Se before p. 183. is an accident growen upon the church, experience it self sheweth. For the subject is before his accident, which is contingent and separable. The Church was many ages, when the papacie was not: The papacie came to the church contingently (beside the being of the Church) and so may be separated from it: as at this time also there are Churches, where the papacie is not; and there wilbe churches still hereafter without the papacie. &c. Novv vvhat one word of answer hath M. Ains. hereunto? In this (as in other things) he is as mute as a fish: though all may see, that these are the things that should haue ben insisted upon, if he could haue found any answer. 27. He trifleth also and cavileth about the similitudes of a poyson,Animadv. p. 99, 100. a gan∣grene, and an ulcer in the body, whereunto M. Iunius compareth the popish hie∣rarchie in the church. Neyther doth he keep to the point, vvherein M. Iunius compareth them together: but either maketh other applications of his ovvn, or seeketh out some differences between thē, in other respects, &c. As if similitudes should hold in al things: Whereas he should haue shew∣ed (if he could) that they doe not agree in that, vvherein M. Iunius com∣pareth them together: As first, that these diseases and evils are not the body it self, but differing from it, and yet in it. Secondly, that they are noysome and proue deadly in the end to the body, if there be not help and remedie had against them. Besides that M. Ainsw. himself compareth them here, to the Egyptian boyles, and to the Image which Nebuchadnezar saw, of gold, silver, brasse, yron and clay. Yet I suppose he will put a difference be∣tvveen the boyles, and the Egyptians themselues: neither thinketh the persons spoken of to be vvithout all natural life, nor able to performe any action either good or bad, as was the case of that image it self. The Pro∣phets compare the apostate Ievves (as here he doth the apostate Christi∣ans) to brasse and yron, &c. Ier. 6, 28. Ezec. 22, 18. Shall vve now thereupon conclude against Iudah, as he doth against the church of Rome, to make in deed a verie nullitie of all their actions, ministration, and Churches estate? The Scripture compareth the vvicked to dust, myer, hay, smoke, stubble, tares, melting wax, &c. Psal. 1, 4. & 18, 43. and 37, 2, 20. & 68, 3. & 83, 14. Mat. 13.38. and the godly to trees, corne, seed, the mountaines of Sion. &c. Psal. 1, 3. & 125, 1. Mat. 3, 12. & 13, 38. and Christs comming at that day, to a thieues comming in the night, &c. Matth. 24, 43, 44. 1 Thes. 5, 2. Rev. 16, 15. Were it not now an easie (but a vain) thing for this man, being not able to except a∣gainst these similitudes, for the things vvherein they are compared toge∣ther, yet to set him self to cavill there against, vvhether framing other ap∣plications of his own, or shewing some differences in other respects, &c. 28. But it is specially to be observed, that he saith, If the papacie,Ibid. or papall hierarchie ecclesiasticall (be not the church: so speaketh M. Iunius: for vvhich M. Ains. hath) if it be no part of the body of the Church, butSe before p. 183. an evill grovven up in the church, an accident, a poyson, a gangrene, an ulcer, covertly vvorking a∣gainst the life and health of it, and daungerously eating up the liuely and vvholesome moisture of the church: what shall we think of all the actions of that ecclesiasticall hierarchie, their ministration of sacraments, their making of ministers,
and the whole church administration, by that rank of apostates; they cannot possibly be the actions of the body, of the church, neyther of Christ. Can a scab or gangrene per∣forme any action of a naturall body or member? And now vvhat is become of their true baptisme, and ordination of ministers before pleaded for? these will be but as the operation of the poyson or fretting of the gangrene; for they that did them, being the popish ecclesiasticall hierarchie, were (not the church, for vvhich M. Ains. hath) no parts of the church, but accidents, as the gangrene, or pocks upon the whores body, which consume life and grace, but giue none at all. Could any Anabaptist write more Anabaptistically then thus? Or can a man hold these opinions, & yet not become an Anabaptist, if he walk conscionably? If the baptisme had in the church of Rome, be not true baptisme, yea if it be but as the ope∣ration of poyson, or fretting of the gangrene, &c. ought not al men by al meanes to renounce and reject it? Or will any man of any godlines or consci∣ence still retein it? Haue your selues (O ye Anabaptists) ever said more concerning the baptisme aforesaid, then this man hath done? Yea would you not be ashamed before God and men, to hold and speak thereof as he doeth, and yet still to reteyne it? Ibid.29. But it is just vvith God thus to confound him, vvho as he beganne vvith notorious errour and blasphemie, so still proceedeth in like maner. Here before, at first he said, the baptisme had in the church of Rome, is a false sacrament, & lying signe, not true baptisme, but an idol, a fiction, a false baptisme, an accursed and detestable sacrament; not the signe and seale of Gods covenant, but Ba∣bylons baptisme, such as were the sacrifices & sacraments of Babylon, & the other hea∣thens, &c. Animad. p. 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, &c. His proceeding also is in like sort: pag. 95, 96. And now dravving to an end, he saith againe, that it is not true baptisme, but as the operation of poyson, or fretting of the gangrene, &c. pag. 100. Hovv much better had it ben for him to lay his hand on his mouth, and vvith humblenes to learne to put difference betvveen the church it self, & the apostasie thereof; betvveen Gods ordinances themselues, and Anti∣christs corruptions commingled withal: then thus to tread in Nebuchad∣nezars steps, who burnt the Temple of God, vvhen the apostate Iewes had polluted it: which the Lord notvvithstanding still esteemed to be his, and therefore tooke on him the vengeance of his Temple. 2 Chron. 36, 14, &c. Ezech. 8, &c. with Jer. 50, 28. and 51, 11. The same God still liveth for ever: let this man therefore feare before him: hovv ever he regard not (as he should) vvhat he speaketh afore men: specially if he can cary it away vvith any pretence or applause. Ibid.30. And what pretence hath he here to beare him out in this matter? Can a scab or gangrene (saith he) performe any action of a naturall body or member? But if M. Iunius lived to returne him ansvver, he would keep him to the point in hand, and soon ask of him again, Can a body that hath a scab or gan∣grene performe no actions of a naturall body? And what can M. Ainsw. ansvver hereunto, but it will be against himself, what ever pretence or colour he set upon it? 31. Besides if Hymenaeus and Philetus, spoken off by the Apostle, were
Ministers (though haereticall, schismaticall, apostaticall, &c.) vvho teach∣ing errours, their word did eat as a cancker or gangrene: 2 Tim. 2, 17, 18. vvould M. Ains. therefore conclude (as here he doth) that the baptisme ministred by them vvas not true baptisme, but as the fretting of the gangrene,Ibid. &c. How then said he before, * that he vvas farr from Cyprians errour, who held that it is not baptisme that is ministred by hereticks or schismaticks;Animad. p. 71. and that it is to be renounced and rejected, and accounted as profane. Cyprian. Epist. 70, 71, 72. &c. Or would he, that men should not haue true baptisme? or that they should still reteyne the fretting of a gangrene? &c. Or what vvil he say, if he doe not distinguish betvveen their doctrine of errour, and their o∣ther actions, estate & ministerie, othervvise considered? Likevvise when the apostate Ievves are by the Prophets compared to brasse, yron, lead, tinne, drosse, reffuse, and ofscouring, &c. Jer. 6, 28, 29, 30. Lament. 3, 45. Eze. 22, 18, 19, 20. vvhich cannot doe the actions of the body of a man: will he therfore say, that the circumcision had in Iudah, was not true circum∣cision, & that no actions of the Priests or administration of that church, could possibly be the actions of the body, of the Church, neither of Christ: hovv ever they were considered, and difference put betvveen the church it self and Gods ordinances on the one hand, and their own cor∣ruptions and apostasie on the other? 32. But why speaks he not also of the similitude of the plague or pestilence, used likevvise by M. Iunius? doth he perceiue,Ibid. that the papacie may well be accounted the plague of that church, & yet be distiinguished from the church it self: euen as iniquitie everie vvhere is justly esteemed the plague of churches, cities, kingdomes, and common weales, and yet is distingui∣shed from them notvvithstanding? 33. And why passeth he over M. Iunius his other similitudes of the Dropsie, and Consumption? Hath he no shift or colour there against?Ibid. Doth he see it to be undeniable, that these are accidents of the body, and not the body it self: and that therefore difference is to be put betvveene these diseases themselues, and betvveen the bodies affected therevvith? Why then doeth he not likevvise discerne it in the other? And why doth he not yeeld thereunto? Is it because he closeth up his eyes, least he should see, and hardeneth his heart, least he should understand? So in deed haue many done, both teachers and people, euen in Israell hereto∣fore, and that also from time to time: Whom the Lord therefore puni∣shed accordingly, blynding their eyes, & making their heart fat, & eares heavy: least they should see vvith their eyes, and heare vvith their eares, and understand with their hearts, and convert and be healed. Esa. 6, 9, 10. with Matth. 13, 13, 14, 15. and Act, 28, 25, 26, 27. 34. Where he againe denyeth any calling to be in the church of Rome,Animadv. p. 100. I haue disproved it here before, pag. 188. And vvhere he asketh how God doth call in that church of Rome: Let him aske it of such of his follovvers, as haue heretofore ben of the Priests and members of that church, how they vvere called; and that so as they left that estate: whether it was by
immediate revelation from heauen, or by some meanes here on earth; & whether it was by the word of God, or without it? Let him tel us, whence the Protestants & Churches reformed of late, did come: vvhether from the church of Rome, or no: and hovv they were first called there? Yea let him tell us, vvhere and how himself and his other follovvers (younger then the former) had their calling? If he say, in the Church of England, or by any of the Ministers or Members there: let him remember how he esteemeth of that church, and of the hierarchie there reteyned: yea that he accounteth that Church also, not to be the church of God, but to be Babylon, vvithout the covenant of God, not having true baptisme, nor any part of Christs ministerie at all, yea nor Christ himself for their Me∣diatour, &c. But to let these alone: let him tell us, vvhether he think that God called any by those Prophets and Angels, that are spoken off, Rev. 11, 3. &c. and 14, 6, 8, 9. or by the Prophets and Saints, spoken off, Rev. 18, 24. also vvho be the people of God, and by vvhom they are called out of Ba∣bylon, that are spoken off, Rev. 18, 4. and vvhether none of them were of the church of Rome, & in the Ministerie, yea & in the hierarchie thereof, vvhen God did call them,Here note the case also of Gregorie the great bi∣shop of the church of Rome it self, whom M. Brightman thinks to be the Angell spoken off, Rev. 8, 13. or others by them, &c. Finally, let him tell us what he thinketh (in this behalf) of Robert Grosted, Bishop of Lincolne, a∣bout the yere 1293. of Archbishop Cranmer, & Bishop Ridley, of late yeres: of John Wicklesse, who lived and dyed Parson of Lutterworth in Leycester shier, about the yere 1400. and many others in England and Scotland. Al∣so of Iohn Husse, and Ierome of Prage, in Bohemia; Of Franciscus Petrarcha, Ioan∣nes de rupe scissa; Conradus Hager, Martin Luther, and others in Germanie: Of Waldus, Gulielmus de sancto amore, Farell, and others in France: Of Arnoldus de villa nova, Diazius, and others in Spain: Of Ierome Savanarola, a Monk; & Sil∣vester, a Frier, vvith others in Italie. For all which and exceeding many moe, see their histories in the Acts and Monuments of the Martyrs. Ibid.35. Note also, that these men doe not acknowldge the church of Rome, (in any of the cōsiderations or respects shevved by M. Iunius) to be the bo∣dy of Christ,Yet for the terms them selues, euen particular persons, and these other also may thus be cal∣led, being rightly un∣derstood. the house and Temple of God: no, though the Apostle himself say, as M. Iunius alledgeth, that the man of sinne sitteth in the Temple of God: 2 Thes. 2, 4 and yet they acknovvledge that Christian people, men or women, being joyned in covenant, and having no ministers or Officers, (one or other, better or vvorse) are called in the Scriptures, the body of Christ, the house, city, and kingdome of God, that may also receiue in, and cast out of the church: and (as some say) may mi∣nister both Sacraments and Censures, &c. though yet they shew not in the Scri∣ptures, vvhere a people vvithout Officers are so termed, and did so vvalk. The differences that are among themselues and others hereabout, I stand not upon: vvhiles one saith & admitteth one thing, and others another. That vvhich most now I look unto, is the grounds held generally among thē, & the assertions of some more particularly; together also with this mans pleading in some things thereabout. Anim. p. 24, 25, 26. &c. & 45, 46, 47, &c. & that yet they yeeld not this to churches in apostasie, having officers. 36. Where M. Iunius purposely setteth himself, to satisfy the demaund
of such asSee before p. 184, 185. aske, [hovv it can be the church vvherein the papacie is:] and sheweth [a double consideration of all particular churches, as they are among men: the one on Gods behalf, the other on ours: &c.] M. Ains. (besides thatAnimad, p. 100, 101 he passeth by exceeding many things of speciall moment) coming to speak of the one of the said considerations, he doth not so much as mention the other: Neyther this onely, but omitting both it, & the further declaratiō of them both; layes hold on a sentence that comes a good while after (vvithout due regard of the other betvveen) and then reasoneth thereabout, as he thinketh to be best. Where, still the Reader may obserue, that al his exceptions arise partly on this that he regardeth not the severall respects or considerations noted by M. Iunius, partly be∣cause he confoundeth as all one the Man of sinne, and the Temple of God, also the Beast, and the Church, &c. Now touching the ministerie here spoken off, what difference M. Iunius observed betvveen the Ministerie simply consi∣dered, and the hierarchie growen in that Church upon it, himself could best haue shewed. This particular here is evident, that in one respect he acknovv∣ledgeth the hierarchy to be [an order or estate of apostasy in the church, an accident or evil grovven up therein, as the dropsie, consumption, or gan∣gren in the body:] in another respect he esteemeth the ministerie of Gods ho∣ly things to be there: (though exceedingly corrupted.) As for example, be it that he meant of the ministerie of Baptisme, &c. Which let this opposite now ponder again, and see, whether he must not come either thus to consider with distinction thereabout, or become an Anabaptist. 37. Where he denyeth againe Gods calling to be in that church:Animad. p. 101. I haue handled it here before, p. 188. & 193. &c. Yet seeing he urgeth it so often, let us bring his reasons here to the tryall. He alledgeth, that Paul saith, God will send them that perish, strong delusion, that they shal beleeue lyes, 2 Thes. 2, 10, 11. Therefore (saith M. Ains.) God calleth not the church of Rome, by his spirit & word: nor any in that church, or by any of them in that estate. (For so al∣so he must conclude, for the point in hand.) Novv vvhat a consequent is this? Might he not also thus conclude against Iudah in apostasie: that God did not call that church, nor any in it, or by any of them in that estate: alledgeing vvithall, Ier. 5, 30, 31. and 6, 28, 29, 30. Ezech. 13, and 14 chap. 38. Againe he alledgeth that the Apostle saith, Strong is the Lord God which will condemne Babylon, Rev. 18, 8. and with the spirit of his mouth will consume that lawlesse one, 2 Thes. 2, 8. Therefore (saith M. Ain.) God calleth not the church of Rome with his spirit: nor any in it, or by any of them in that estate: which he affirmed here also before. Animad. p. 98, 99, 100. As if there vvere no difference to be put betvveen the Temple of God, and that lawlesse one, 2 Thes. 2, 4.8. nor betvveen the people of God, and Babylon, Rev. 18, 4, 8. Or as if Gods work were all one, concerning the one, and the other. 39. And (saith he) whereas they cal the Scripture the publick record of that holy mariage between God and her: the Scripture shewes no such mariage,Ibid. but doth defy her as an harlot: Rev. 17, 1. Where is the record (saith he againe) that Christ was ever maried to the Beast that came up from the bottomles pit? Rev. 17, 8. I answer, The
Scripture sheweth record of the mariage of that church, the church of Rome. Rom. 1, 7, 8. & 7, 4. & 16, 19. And himself did acknowledge it before, more then once (pag. 84, and 98.) hovv ever he doe now call for declara∣tion of it. Neyther is it any thing that he saith, God doth defy her as an harlot, Rev. 17, 1. For (besides that he putteth no difference between Babylon, and the church or Temple of God) what will he say to Israel, yea to Iudah al∣so and Ierusalem, in this behalf? Thinks he not, that God also defyed thē as harlots, Jer. 3, 8, 11. with Esa. 1, 21. and 57, &c. Hos. 2, 2 — 5. and Ezec. 16, 2, 3, 4 — 35, &c. and 23, 2 — 45. will he therefore say, that the Scripture shewes no record of their mariage with God? What then saith he to Exod. 19, 4, 5, 6. and Ezech. 16, 8. (vvhich places himself here before alledged, for a co∣venant with al the earth, p. 97.) what also to Esa. 50, 1. Ier. 3, 1. Ezech. 23, 4. But it exceedeth all, that he blusheth not to aske, Where is the record that Christ was ever maried to the beast that came up from the bottomles pit? Rev. 17, 8. To the Beast! That Christ vvas ever maried to the Beast! Did M. Iunius ever say so? Or thinks he, that ever it entred into his thought? Did not M. Iunius speak expressely of the Church? Will this man never learne to put difference between the Beast and the Church? betvveen the Man of sinne and the Temple of God? Is it not unsufferable, that he should thus abuse not onely M. Iunius and our selues and his Readers all, but euen the Scri∣pture it self also? Said not himself euen novv, that it is most strange that men should publish their ovvn esteemings, without any word of God to warrant them? Animad. p. 101. And did he not very sharply rebuke M. Sm. heretofore, and count it blnydnes, impiety, abuse of the word of God, blaspemy, de∣ceit, and dotage, when he applied the Court without the Temple, and the things spoken thereabout, to the assemblies of Antichrist, to Antichrists Church, &c. M. Ainsw. defence of Scrip. p. 12, 13, 14, 15. Will he now thus think of his owne dealing, or censure himself in like sort, vvho applieth to the Beast himself, the things that are spoken of the Church: yea that confounds the Beast, and the church, as all one? Which vvhat is it els, but to confound Antichrist the Man of sinne, and the Temple of God, as all one: and this also then, vvhenas they are purposely and expressely distinguished, the one from the other? Animadv. p. 101. 10240. Most strange also it is, that he saith Gods calling is no more in the church of Rome, then among the heathens. Which I haue convinced before, pag. 188, & 193. &c. And can he ever vvarrant this by the word of God? As for D. Fulks testimonie, I obserue it, & agree to many things in it: although he might haue ben better advised, then vvithout any limitation to say they taught the people nothing els, but to pronounce certaine Latin words, &c. And where he saith, there were many thousand parishes in England, that in 60 yeeres never heard sermon in their life: this shevveth the corruption of that age and estate: but will it therefore follow, that neyther in those parishes, nor in any other, either of England, or othervvhere, agreeing vvith the church of Rome in their profession & constitution, God called any to know him in Iesus Christ? What vvill he say, if of later dayes, synce the Pope vvas abandoned out of England, there be some parishes that haue not had any
sermon among them, in 20 or 30 yeres (or let us suppose, it vvere 50 or 60 yeres:) vvill he therefore conclude, that there is no more calling ney∣ther in those parishes, nor othervvhere in the church of England, then a∣mong the heathens? D. Fulk, if he lived, would disclayme such collections? M. Broughton saith, Millions of millions of Romes clients are saved. Brough. on Rev. 13, 18. pag. 203. And vvhat M. Iunius his judgment is, vve see here. And many moe might be alledged. But to let them alone: let this man con∣sider between God and his own soule, where himself and his follovvers (of one sort and another) had their calling, if his assertions here, or his other opinions (not unknowen) touching the churches aforesaid, be true. 41. Where M. Iunius vvould make the matter plain by a similitude frō Jer. 3. of a woman committing adulterie, whom her husband is willing to pardon,Animadv. p. 102. and stil to reteyn for his wife, of his owne goodnes and mercy towards her, though not accor∣ding to her desert, who hath broken the band of wedlock on her part, &c. he neyther mentioneth nor ansvvereth (as he should) the severall respects purpose∣ly noted by M. Iunius. And touching pardon, excluding it wholly, that vvhich the Apostle speaketh expressely and particularly of the Man of sin, and of them that perish, because they receiue not the loue of the truth, &c. 2 Thes. 2, 9 — 12. that he applieth (for exclusion from pardon, and certain condem∣nation) to the vvhole church of Rome, and so to all the members thereof (vvhether particularly, or more generally considered) & that for al ages, that eyther haue ben, are or shall be, ever since the man of sinne and that lavvlesse one, was seated there. 42. He denyeth that this harlot (the adulterate church of Rome) was ever Christs spouse, otherwise then as all the world was by our first parents Adam & Noe.Ibid. If this be so, how then hath she broken the covenant of wedlock be∣tvveen Christ and her, if she were never in it? Hovv can she be called a vvhore, in respect of Christ, any more then the heathens that never knew God in Christ? How can she be said to be in apostasie & defection from Christ, if she never vvere in the faith and way of Christ? How saith him∣self othervvhere, that the West churches (of which he knoweth the church of Rome to be one) were for their apostasie delivered by God into the hands of that false horned beast, Antichrist: euen as Israell and Judah of old, for their like sinnes, were delivered into the hands of the Assyrians and Babylonians. Animadv. p. 84. Or vvill he say, that Israell and Iudah (with whom himself compareth these Churches) never were the spouse of Christ, otherwise then al the vvorld was, by our first parents Adam and Noah? No marvell, if he think there is no calling in that church, any more then among the heathens: if this vvere so as he saith. And no marvell, if he say, the baptisme had in that church, is not true baptisme, but an idol, & nothing in the world, a lying signe, & execrable sacrament, &c. Hearken again ye Anabaptists: what notorious reasons M. Ains. hath for you: and tell me, if ever any among your selues came to this conceit, to think that the church of Rome now adulterate, this harlot never was the spouse of Christ otherwise then as all the world was, by our first parents Adam and Noah. And hang downe your heads (if M. Ains. say right) all ye protestants and
reformed churches; yea and reverse your writings, allM. Calvin Luther, Broughtō, Whitaker, Raynolds, Iunius, Po∣lanus, Pis∣cator, &c. ye the godly & learned writers of this later age, who in all your pleading and leaving of the church of Rome, haue still insisted upon this, as a mayne ground, that she is an adulteresse, at this day, committing vvhoredome against Iesus Christ, both by idolatrie, and by other apostasie and iniquitie; for which you haue left her, and still doe thus plead against her. For eyther your plea is not good and sound, or M. Ains. ansvver is frivolous, and his asser∣tions here notably erroneous. Animad. p 102.43. He saith moreover: This is not the church of Rome to whom Paul wrote, Rom. 1. but another of vvhom he prophecied, 2 Thes. 2. She succeedeth in the same place, as the night succeedeth the day. The church in Pauls time came from heauen, Rev. 21, 2. and is long since gone to God: this came up from the bottomles pit, Rev. 17, 8. and thither she must returne. She is of another religion, the daughter of a strange God. Thus M. Ainsvv. answereth M. Iunius in such sort, as if one (upon occasion of like question in Israell, in the time of Ieroboams or Manasses apostasie) should haue said, This is not the church of Israel, to whom Moses wrote, and gaue Gods lavves, Deut. 31, 24, &c. but another of whom he pro∣phecied, Deut 32, 5, 6, 15. &c. But the Scripture teacheth us better to un∣derstand things then thus, as he doth. The Psalme speaking of Israell in former and later times, saith, The Lord turned the sea into dry land: they vvent through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him. Psal. 66, 6. And (vvhich com∣meth nearer the cause in hand) Hoseah speaking to Israell in apostasie, in the time of Ieroboam the second, saith: God found Iacob in Bethel, and there he spake vvith us. Hos. 12, 4. Were it not vayne novv for one to except and say, Iacob vvas long since gone to God: this people of Israell was novv of another religion, the daughter of a strange God, &c. And as for the church of Rome it self, vvhere M. Ains. saith: It vvas another of vvhich Paul prophecied, 2 Thes. 2. then that to vvhich he vvrote, Rom. 1. he should remember vvithall, that in the same place Paul saith, the mysterie of iniquity did then alrea∣dy vvork, &c. 2 Thes. 2, 7. Now I ask, where that mysterie now vvrought in Pauls time, and vvhere the Man of sinne (there spoken off) came to be exalted and seated: whether at Rome or not? If he say at Rome, let him consider with himself, vvhat vvill follovv thereupon. If he say, it was not there, let him then shevv us some other place in Pauls time, where that mysterie of iniquitie did then work, and came aftervvard to be seated, & that also in the Temple of God: noting vvithall, vvhat now letted for a time till it vvas taken out of the way: whereof the Apostle likevvise speaketh in the same place, 2 Thes. 2, 4, 6, 7. I could also tell him, that the speach & question now is not eyther of particular persons in this or that age, or of severall churches (as he would by his answers dravv it unto) but of one & the same church, diversly considered, according to the divers respects that are to be observed thereabout from time to time. And hereunto he must keep, if he wil answer M. Iunius. Otherwise if he will needs be wandring, let him wander still on, till he come to ansvver M. Iunius othervvhere. Ibid.44. And note vvithall, how he saith here, that the church of Rome to
whom Paul vvrote, Rom. 1. is long since gone to God. Yet othervvhere he saith, The Church of Rome, as PaulRom. 11, 20, 21, 22. forewarned, was for unbelief cut off. Animad. p. 84. Novv whom and vvhere did Paul thus forevvarne? was it not the church of Rome, to whom he wrote? and was it not in that Epistle which he wrote unto them: vvhich himself here citeth for confirmation thereof? And wil he then make it all one, to goe to God, and to be cut off for unbelief? Or will he novv for his ovvne plea, admit of divers considerations to be had of one and the same church, in divers respects? If not, hovv vvill he recon∣cile these things, and clear himself of contradiction? 45. His perverting of the Scripture, and applying to the church,Animad. p. 102. that vvhich is expressely spoken of the Beast, Rev. 17, 8. into vvhich here again he runneth, I haue shevved before. As also, hovvSee be∣fore pag. 113, &c. the Ievves being ene∣mies in themselues, yet are beloved for the Fathers sakes, Rom. 11, 28. ob∣serving thereby a divers consideration to be had of persons & things, ac∣cording to divers respects: as M. Iunius also doth in this place, where he alledgeth it. To which if M. Ainsvv. vvill not keep, let him follovv on his owne wandring course. 46. Where he saith, If the Jewes are beloved for their good fathers sakes:Animad. p. 102. then Rome (vvhy saith he not, the church of Rome) may well be hated for her evill fathers sakes. For who were her Fathers, but the Gentiles, Sodomites, and Egyptians, Rev. 11, 2, 8, 18. not the Saints in Rome: for she is not of their faith and sanctity: If he meane this of the city of Rome, he speaks not to the point in hand. If he meane it of the church of Rome, what will he answer if vve alledge those sayings of the Prophets, who speaking of the Iewes, euen of Ierusalem & Israell, say: Thus saith the Lord God unto Ierusalem, Thy birth and thy nativitie is of the land of Canaan, thy Father vvas an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite. Ezec. 16, 3. And again: Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israell, saith the Lord? Amos 9, 7. Will he say, that Ierusalem and Israell therefore vvere not ever the spouse of Christ, any more then the Hittites, Amorites, and Ethiopians? Or vvill he admit of no other consideration novv of Israell, in any respect, but onely aske, as here he doth, Who vvere their Fathers, but the Hittites, Amorites, and E∣thiopians, Ezec. 16, 3. and Amos 9, 7. not the Patriarks and Saints in Israel; for these vvere not of their faith and sanctity? Or vvill he yet learne to leaue off his ca∣villing, and by these occasions thus offered by himself, to consider and speak of persons and things diversly, in divers respects? Or vvhat will he ansvver hereunto? What ever it be, let him take it as an answer to himself: and in deed against himself, and for us. 47. But he saith, there is not so much as likelihood,Ibid. p. 102 103. that this church is the naturall posteritie of the Saints in Rome: because that besides the blooody persecutions in those times, there haue ben many changes of the Romane state, and great commotions & trou∣bles, by the Gothes, and Vandals, in the yere of Christ, 414, 454, 546. and aftervvard a∣gain by the Saracens, &c. And vvhat then? The strangers, that came to Israel (whether in times of synceritie or of apostasie) were of the church of Is∣raell as vvell as the Ievves, and so to be esteemed, though they were not
of the same naturall posteritie with them. 2 Chron. 15, 9. and 30, 25. vvith v. 5, 6, 7, &c. and vvith Lev. 16, 29. and Numb. 9, 14. Besides, doeth he think that the bloody persecutions in those times, cut of the whole church of Rome? Himself vvill not say it. Al histories vvitnesse othervvise. See but the Acts and Monuments in the ten first and great persecutions, with the histories there follovving. And where he speaketh of the many changes of the Romane state, and great commotions, and troubles by the Gothes and Vandals, &c. these spe∣cially concern the Romane state (as himself here speaketh) touching the city & Empire of Rome, vvith the territories & jurisdiction thereof: whereas our question is onely of the church of Rome. But be it applied to the church, which also went through all that great and generall calamitie: yet let us remember, how Ierusalem & Iudah of old vvere taken by Nebuchadnezar, the city and temple burnt, the land left desolate, the people of higher and lovver estate, some slaine by the svvord, some perishing vvith famine and pestilence, others caried away captiue into Babylon, and so remayning in captivitie, seuenty yeres: yet God in the midst of his vvrath remembring mercy, still preserved a rem∣nant: vvhom afterward he called out of Babylon (Ier. 51, 45 vvith Rev. 18, 4.) And in all the changes and calamities of that people, yet is their estate stil to be looked upon, as being the same people, though living in severall ages, & differing greatly one frō another, both in their religion, & other condition, diversly considered. Neyther is it to be neglected, that in all these chaunges and troubles stil they continued circumcision among thē, and vvere still continued under the covenant of God, though themselues brake it many vvaies, and vvalked unvvorthy of it. Psal. 89, 30— 34. Ezec. 16 chap. Which likewise is to be observed concerning the Church of Rome, and other churches of Christians in apostasie, in the midst of all the chan∣ges and calamities, vvhereunto they haue ben subject diversly. Neyther can this man himself shevv, that ever the church of Rome ceased to be, synce it vvas first planted, but that it hath continued still (eyther in synce∣rity, or apostasie) euen to this day: Nor can he shevv, that the Lord hath yet put them out of his covenant, and giuen them a bil of divorce; or that they haue left off to baptize in his name, &c. And yet further (if vve mark it vvel) M. Ain. his ansvver about this mat∣ter, is much like as the Papists giue themselues. When the Papists are ur∣ged vvith this, that Rome is the seat of Antichrist the Beast, seing it is the city that is built on seuen hilles, whereof Iohn speaketh, Rev. 17, 9. they ansvver, that in deedRhem. Annot. on Rev. 17, 9. Rome of old stood on seuen hilles: butD. Saun∣ders, &c. the city is now gone from the hilles, and standeth in the plain of Campus Martius, & the Pope sitteth on the other side of the river, upon the hill Vaticane, &c. As if by reason of these chaun∣ges, Rome were not Rome still, nor these Popes the successours of the o∣ther Popes that vvere before, &c. In like sort, when M. Ains. is urged with this, that the church of Rome is become an harlot, &c. he answereth, thatAnimad. p. 102, 103 th harlot is not the church of Rome that was of old: it hath had many chaunges and ∣rations since, both in religion and the Romane state, &c. As if therefore the church
and city of Rome, vvere not the church, and City of Rome still: though they be altered many vvaies, and in sundry respects. Many other things hereabout (if it vvere needfull) might also be ob∣served: on vvhich I purpose not to insist. As, that by the invasion and ca∣lamities vvhich came upon Rome, & the vvesterne Empire, by the Goths and Vandals &c. may be understood the wounding of the Beasts head, spo∣ken off Rev. 13, 3. Now difference is to be put between the Church, and the Beast, as is aforesaid. Besides, euen the Beasts head thus wounded, vvas al∣so healed againe. Rev. 13, 3. And an head, now vvounded, novv healed, is still the same head, though in several estate and condition. Moreover, his ovvne narration here (hovv ever it be understood and applied, whether to the church, or Romane state of the empire &c:) is against himself. For if Alaricus with his Gothes did utterly vvast & destroy it: vvhat remay∣ned for Genscricus vvith his Vandals afterward to doe thereabout? Or if these did vvholly spoile and consume it, what did Odoacer vvith another company there aftervvard? Or if these did effect an utter ruine, vvhat then did Theodoricus and the Ostrogothes after that? And so may be observed of the rest here spoken off, of Bellisarius vvith his army; of Totilas king of the Gothes; of the Saracens, &c. If he say, he speaketh not of an utter destruction, it is the more against himself. Or if he meane it of an utter destruction, his ovvne narration crosseth it, besides the testimonie of all histories. Yea those very clauses, where he saith, that Rome for a time remayned vvithout any inhabitant, man or vvoman, (and that, by the space of fourty dayes, though he mention not this particular) shevv that this vvas not an utter spoyling of them for altogether, but onely for a time: and so is still against himself. Furthermore many of those people, that made these invasions, became Christians themselues, and so the church (in this behalf) vvas increased. Not to speak how the very Catalogue of the Bishops of the church of Rome, giveth evidence against him. Or vvill he say, that though there vvere Bi∣shops of that Church, (vvhether better or vvorse) yet there vvas not a church vvhereof they vvere Bishops? And mark, that in the particulars which here he speaketh of, the first time that he noteth, is the yere of Christ 414. &c. Novv let him speak therefore, vvhether till this time (and never after) there vvas at Rome, a church of God, under the covenant of God, having true baptisme, or no.. If he say, there vvas not: to what end then is this particular narration of his, noting such a yere, and such a yere, &c. Is it not all in vaine? If he say, there vvas: then it vvas some hundreds of yeres after Pauls time, that yet still it remayned the church of God; yea and long after that many great corruptions, and the hierarchie of Anti∣christ also, had seazed upon it. How also will he shevve that now at this time (let him take any of the yeres that he nameth) it ceased to be the church of God, and to haue Gods baptisme and covenant any longer? Finally (to bring the truth more clearely to light, and the matter to a plaine issue) let him consider with himself, and speak directly & advised∣ly, vvhether the church of Rome, that was espoused to Christ, is become an harlot, or not?
If he say, it is: himself vvill soone perceiue all his dispute here to be vaine and erroneous. If he say, it is not: how then saith he othervvhere, that she is fallen into Apostasie like Israels? Animadv. p. 84. For did not Israel, being espoused to the Lord, become an harlot? And was it not the same Israel, for the body of the church, in the account of the Lord and his Prophets (though not in the same particular persons, at al times) that vvas both the one and the other: whether we look on the ten tribes, or on Iudah, or both? Esa. 1, 21. Ier. 3 ch. Ezech. 16. and 23 chap. Hos. 2, 1 — 7. and 3, 1. and 12 chap. and 13, 4, 5. and 14, 1. Which is likewise to be observed, touching the church of Rome, and all other churches, in like estate, from time to time. Othervvise the Papists one way, and the Anabaptists another way, wilbe confirmed in their errors, to the hardening of themselues, & seducing of others more and more. And so let M. Ain. obserue the fruit of his oppo∣sition of the truth, and rejoyce therein, but not vvith God. 48. His esteeming of the state of the church of Rome in apostasie, to be but as the estate of the Ishmaelites, and Edomites, also as Adonisedek vvith his Amorites and Jebusites in Ierusalē, &c. is disproved & cōtradicted by himself, when he maketh them like Israel and Iudah, in their apostasie. Animad. p. 84. Neyther doth M. Iunius giue this reason vvhy he accounts thē the church of God, because they are the naturall posterity of the saints (though this is not to be neglected, being duly considered) neither because they dvvel in Rome, where the godly lived heretofore. These are things put in by M. Ains. himself: for what cause, himself knovveth best. M. Iunius knew, that there dwell Iewes at Rome, vvho are not of the church, and that the naturall posteri∣ty of the Saints, may become Ievves, Turks, Pagans, and (as here he said expressely)See here before pag. 185. the church may at length cease to be a church, when God ceaseth to call it back, and takes away the evidence of their holy mariage, that is, the holy Scripture, out of the hand of the adulteresse, &c. 49. Where M. Ainsw. inferreth, that thus our reasons from Israell, are also im∣pertinent to the present estate of the church of Rome:Animadv. p. 103. he should remember, hovv himself said before, that the typicall estate of Israell, is our1 Cor. 10 6, 11. ensamples: Animad. p. 87. & more particularly, the Apostasie of the church of Rome, is like Israels. Animad. pag. 84: But contradictions are not uncouth with him, synce he beganne to turne himself into all colours, for the mainteyning (vvhat he can) of his errors and sinfull courses. 50. Aboue all, obserue and remember, that now he saith, our reasons from Israell,Animad. p. 103. might vvell serue for the times wherein Iohn lived, when the true churches were many of them apostate: Rev. 2, and 3 chap. Yet here before he said, that Israell in their apostasie were not the Lords people, or wife, nor under his covenant, &c. Animad. pag. 82. & that their sacraments were false, and lying signes, &c. How then should our reasons from Israel, serue for those churches, which here himself cal∣leth true churches: unles he wil say that true churches, & (in particular) those churches in Iohns time, spoken of Rev. 2 & 3 ch. were not the Lords people, or wife, nor under his covenant: & that their sacramēts were false, & lying signes, &c. If not, will he novv say, that the case of Israell in apostasie, vvas like the
estate of the churches aforesaid, which here he saith were apostate: & that therefore they also were now the Lords people and wife, under his covenant, ha∣ving true sacraments, the signes and seales of Gods covenant, &c. Or seeing these churches vvhich he saith vvere apostate, are yet by the Lord esteemed golden Candlesticks, in the midst whereof Christ novv vvalked, &c. Rev. 1, 12, 20. and 2, 1. will he so acknovvledge likevvise concerning Israell, vvith whom novv he matcheth these Churches (that so he might the better, as he thinketh, exclude the church of Rome, from all comparison therewith?) If not, hovv will he reconcile these things together. 51. Note also, how novv he acknowledgeth them to be true Churches,Ibid. which he saith were apostate: vvhereas still throughout his discourse and reasoning, he denyeth apostate churches to be true churches. What now vvil his followers and favourites say hereunto, vvho can make no end of their odious exclamations, against others that speak any such thing: though it be vvith distinction, and upon just and needfull occasion, for clearing the truth, and convincing of errour, &c. 52. What also will himself and his followers say to this,Ibid. that the chur∣ches which he saith vvere apostate, are by the Lord himself acknowledg∣ed for golden Candlesticks; and churches wherein Christ walketh; and their ministers also to be starres in the right hand of Christ, &c. Rev. 1, 11, 12, 16, 20. & 2, 1. &c. and 3, 1, &c. Will they now admit of a divers consideration of the same churches, and of their ministerie, and estate, in divers respects? If not, how vvill they reconcile their ovvne assertions and the Scriptures together, vvhich are alledged by themselues? Rev. 2, and 3 chapters. 53. Where M. Iunius commeth againe to a double consideration of the church of Rome: one, as it hath all the divine things in the Scriptures, another as it hath them al corrupt, &c. M. Ains. (after his manner) passeth by sundry things of special moment, vvhich M. Iunius purposely noteth hereabout:Ibid. neither keepeth he to the points in hand, as he should: besides that he speaketh sometimes of things granted by all; or taketh for granted things which he should proue, and which I haue before again & again disproved: As namely, that still he confoundeth as all one, the Church, and the Beast arisen out of the bottomles pit: And, that he maketh the church of Rome to be the vvoman or city that (in Iohns time) reigned over the kings of the earth. Rev. 17, 1, 18. And where he saith, it is not properly the old church of Rome corrupted; but a nevv church arisen out of the bottomles pit: vvhat meaneth he here by the vvord pro∣perly? Or doth he grant it improperly to be the old church of Rome corrupted? vvhy then said he here before, that it vvas never Christs spouse, othervvise then as all the vvorld vvas, by our first parents Adam and Noah. Animad. pag. 102. And where against hath he disputed all this vvhile? Not to speak, how sharply he rebuked M. Sm. when he vvould distinguish betweene the worship of the Nevv Testament properly so called, and not properly. M. Ainsvv. Defence of Script. pag. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 54. But it is not the vvoman fled into the vvildernesse: What then?Ibid. Difference is to be put between the inward parts of the Temple, and the outvvard;
betvveen the parts of the Temple that vvere measured, & the parts that were left unmeasured; betvveen the Temple of God, with the Altar, and worshippers therein, spoken off Rev. 11, 1. and between the court of the Temple giuen to the Gentiles, and the holy city trode dovvne by them tvvo and fourty moneths, as is said Rev. 11, 2. If it be not one of these, shal it therefore be none of them? If it be not the inner part of the Temple, vvil it therefore follow that it is not the outvvard? Or is not the outward Court and city also the Lords, because they are not the invvard parts of the Temple that are measured, but left out unmeasured, and giuen to the Gentiles, and trode upon by them, the time appointed. This man himself doth here presently after, acknovvledge, that the church of Rome, is theAnimad. p. 104. court of Gods Temple invaded, and the holy city trode downe by the Gentiles, Rev. 11, 2. And othervvhere he teacheth, that theDefence of Script. p. 13, 14, 15. court of the Temple, & the holy ci∣ty (spoken off, Revel. 11, 2.) did signify the Bhurch of God: and, that this also is the doctrine of all the Prophets: citing to that end, Psal. 51, 18. and 87. and 122. Esa. 60. Revel. 21. Where moreover he sheweth, that Ierusalem is often called the holy city, Nehem. 11, 1. Esa. 48, 2. and 52, 1. Mat. 4, 5. All which things lead us to look upon the Church of Rome, as being answerable to the Lords courts and city of Ierusalem. Besides, vvhen vvas the time, that the woman fled into the wildernes? Was it in Constantines time (vvhen one vvould least haue thought it, in such a time of peace and outvvard flourishing of the Church) three hun∣dred yeres after Christ: asM. Bright mā on Rev. 12, 6, 14, 15. & 11, 1, 2.1. &c. M. Forbes on Rev. 12 s. 10, &c. some of good judgment doe write? If so it be understood, shall we then think there vvas no outward visible church or Churches in the vvorld from that time, to this later age, for the space of tvvelue or thirteen hundred yeres? Where then, and hovv were the Court of the Temple and holy city trode upon by the Gentiles, and that for the space of two and forty moneths? Rev 11, 2. Where did Antichrist now sit in the Temple of God, all this vvhile? 2 Thes. 2, 4. Or had not the Christian apo∣state churches, baptisme, and other ordinances of God continued among them (though with corruptions) al this time: as Iudah and Israel had cir∣cumcision and other constitutions of God, in the time of their apostasie? If it be applyed to the times and invasions of the Gothes and Vandals spoken of before: like consequences vvill follovv, as upon the former: & somevvhat more, inasmuch as these also wasted the churches of Afri∣ca: besides all the spoile that they did in the west, as is aforesaid. Or let this man himself name any time (vvhatsoever liketh him best) for the wo∣mans flight into the vildernes: and he shall still find like consequences, & other moe to follow thereupon. Finally let him consider, where himself and his follovvers had their baptisme? vvhether in any visible Church of God, or not? And, vvhether the Lords ordinance of baptisme hath not ben continued, and deduced from the Apostles, unto our dayes, through all the time and estate of the apostasie aforesaid? Animadv. p. 104.55. Where he maketh the church of Rome ansvverable to the armie of Canaanites, Gentiles, Babylonians, Infidels, &c. to vvhom novv will he resemble
the wolf Antichrist himself with his sheeps skin and lambes hornes? keeping due proportion vvith the cases spoken of in the Scriptures here cited by him self? Mat. 7, 15. Rev. 13, 11. and 16, 16. Iudg. 5, 19. Rev. 11, 2. Psal. 79, 1. &c. Ier. 51, 1, 2. &c. Lam. 1, 10. Or vvill he still confound these, as all one: which he seeth M. Iunius doth purposely distinguish? Or will he needs contra∣dict himself vvith one and the same breath, whiles here he maketh the church of Rome to be also the Court of Gods Temple, & holy city, inva∣ded and troden dovvne by the Gentiles? Rev. 11, 2. Or finally vvill he not cease to speak M. Sm. language, vvhom, vvhen he applied this to the syna∣gogue of Antichristians (as now himself doeth) he rebuked very sharply, as I haue shevved here before, pag. 133. and may be seene in his Defence of Script. pag. 12 — 15. 56. Why also saith he,Ibid. At first those Gentiles invaded the courts of Gods temple, and trode downe the holy city, Rev. 11, 2. as if this had ben Gods court and city but at first, and that this invasion and treading downe had ben soone done: when as in this very place, vvhich himself citeth, it is said, they were giuen to the Gentiles, and troden upon by them, for the space of two and forty moneths, or (as is in the next verse follovving) a thou∣sand two hundred & sixty daies: whenas yet al this time they are stil the Lords court and city, though defiled and trode dovvne, as Ierusalem and the Sanctuarie vvas, by the heathens of old. Psa. 79, 1. Dan. 8, 9-13. and 11, 31. &c. And why moreover maketh he his inference thus, If that army of infidels ere Gods true church, so is the synagogue of Antichristians: and not rather thus, If that city and sanctuarie (though profaned and trode dovvne) was still Gods true Temple and city, so also is the church of Rome: vvhich is here compared thereunto? 57. When he saith, the Heathens in their altars,Ibid. temples sacrifices &c. had the divine things of God among them aswel, if not better, then hath the Man of sinne & his vvorshippers, in their sacrifice of the Masse, and other manifold Idolatries: vvhy saith e not, then hath the church of Rome in their Baptisme, and other divine hings of God had among them, though corrupted? Doth himself per∣eiue, that thus his assertions would be plainely false, and not so deceiue he simple, as now they do? Or seeth he not, that M. Iun. speaketh expres∣y of the church of Rome, and doth purposely distinguish betvveen it, & he man of sinne with his hierarchie? Why then keeps he not to the point in and? Why confounds he things that differ? As if that circumcision & he other divine things of God, had in Iudah and Israel, though corruptly sed in the time of their apostasie, were not to be distinguished frō their olatries, vvhether in feasts, sacrifices, or other things which they had a∣ong them, of their own forging and devising? 1 King. 12, 28 — 33. 2 King. 6, 10— 16. with 2 Chorn. 28, 2, 3, 4. and 33, 1 — 9. 58. WhereSee here before, p. 186. M. Iunius purposely answereth two doubts and difficulties, by hich the minds of many are troubled: the first, vvhat vve are to judge of the members  the church of Rome; the latter vvhat the duety of them is, who are in that church, & e the great corruptions thereof: M. Ains. passeth by the first, whereof speciall
regard should be had: and comming to the latter, he clippeth M. Iunius ansvvers (as he is vvoont) omitting divers things of vvaight: and having not vvhat to ansvver, sets himself to cavil at those words, where M. Iunius saith, [the duetie of those that are in the popish church, and see the grie∣vous corruptions of it, is such as of those children, vvhich dwel with their adulterous mother, that is, to abhorre her sinne, vvith speach and signe to call her back from evill, to absteyn themselues there from, & in al things to cleaue to their father, &c.] Thus (saith he) it appeareth, that these our Opposites are returned to acknovvledge the vvhore of Rome, to be their mother, &c. But first, this is no answer to the point in hand. Hath M. Iunius here set downe that vvhich is right and agreeable to the word of God, or not? If he haue, why yeelds he not unto it? If he haue not, vvhy doth he not confute it? Secondly, vvhy doth he not also inferre, saying, [Thus it ap∣peareth, that these our opposites acknowledge the Lord God to be their Father, to vvhom in all things they are to cleaue, &c. Thirdly, may not godly Christians (being in such estate, and so demeaning themselues, as M. Iunius speaketh) acknowledge the adulterate church of Rome to be their mother, as the godly Iewes did acknowledge Ierusalem, Iudah, and Is∣raell, being harlots, to be their mother notwithstanding? Esa. 1, 21. with 50, 1. Jer. 15, 8. Ezech. 16, 3, 44, 45. and 23, 2, 3, 4, &c. Hos. 2, 1, 2. and 3, 1. &c. Lastly, what church for their mother, had these men themselues, vvherein they were borne and baptised, and with whom they lived, till they came to be thus persvvaded as novv they are? Any, or none? Let them look about and tell us: and then see, what vvill follow. Ibid.59. And vvhereas M. Ains. (to haue the more colour for his exception) takes hold of those words, vvhere M. Iunius in other places before com∣pared (he saith feigned) the estate of the church of Rome to be [asSe before pag. 184. a body vvhich lyeth svvollen vvith vvaters of the dropsie, or vvith poyson, vvhich had long agoe giuē up the ghost, if God by the medicine of his grace, &c. had not nourished and kept her warme:] First, vvhy esteemeth he these similitudes to be but M. Iunius fictions? Are they not fit and pertinent, for the matter in hand? If not, vvhy hath he not disproved them? Or are the similitudes vvhich M. Ainsw. useth himself, to be esteemed but as fictions of his owne? When here before he compared the hierarchie of Antichrist to the Egyptian boyles, and to the Image vvhich Nebuchadnezar savv, would he haue it thought, that these vvere but his ovvne feignings. Animadv. p. 100. Or whenD. Rayn. six Conclu∣sions, in the fift of them: as they are printed in his Confe∣rence with Hart, pag. 650. D. Raynolds useth the same similitudes, as M. Iunius doth here, vvill he say also, they are his fictions? But specially, vvhy answers he not M. Iunius (if he be able) to the points in hand, neither here, nor in the other places aforesaid? If they vvere but fictions onely that M. Iun. feigneth, they might be the sooner and soundlyer ansvvered. And be∣sides when M. Iunius saith, [she had long agoe giuen up the ghost, if God by the medicine of his grace and long suffering had not nourished her:] why leaues he out that vvord of Gods long suffering, and puts in for it, &c. was it so much or so long to write downe this clause, vvhen he wrote all the
rest? Or thinks he, that God hath used no long suffering tovvards that church, as he hath done towards other? Or vvould he, that the Reader should not obserue it, because it is against himself? But to proceed, let us heare, vvhat he inferreth upon the foresaid speaches of M. Iunius: Now (saith he) to leaue their mother thus on her sick bed, as they haue done (My treat of the Mi∣nister. pag. 60— 62. disclayming all Christian duety unto her, vvhichMy treat of the Mi∣nister. pag. 60— 62. is due to a true church in corruption) is but the part of unnaturall children. Whiles God doth nourish and keep her vvarme, vvill they quite abandon her? As if M. Iunius had not here purposely and expressely said, [1. ThatSee here before, pag 186. the duty of such as are in that church, and see the great corru∣ptions of it, is as of children that dvvell vvith their adulterous mother. In vvhich case, a wise sonne vvill abhor and absteyn from his mothers sinne, and vvill vvith speach and signe call her back from evill, and in all things cleaue unto his father: and while he can by reason of his mother, vvill cleaue unto her, next after his father: but when and vvhiles by reason of her, he cannot doe it vvith good conscience, for the spirituall and bodily injurie of her, will then betake himself into the chamber or inner roome of his father, where also is the church, the mother of us all. Gal. 4, 26. Se∣condly, that this therefore is not a good consequent, if one depart from this or that church, therefore he doth altogether depart from the church. Yea, that he doeth but trifle, that doth so from a particular, conclude uni∣versally, &c. Thirdly, that the duty aforesaid, vvas religiously performed by our ancestors, whō the popish tyrannie for some ages exercised, &c.] Which M. Iunius shevveth largely in sundry particulars: as may be seene here before, pag. 186, 187. And vvhat now vvould these men haue more to be done? Would they, that such as since haue ben borne and brought up in other churches, should returne to the church of Rome, & doe like∣wise? Or haue themselues done the like to such, as they hold to be true Churches in corruption? Or knovv they not, that vvhen Iudah and Israell became harlots, the Lord taught the godly, to plead vvith them, as vvith their mother, and yet to leaue and let them alone, and not to partake in their idolatries or other corruptions? Hos. 2, 1, 2. & 4, 1, 15, 17. Amos 3, 1, 2. vvith 4, 4, 5. and 5, 5. Mich. 6, 1, 2, 16. vvith Ezech. 23, 2, 3, 4 — 36. and Ier. 15, 19. & Esa. 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18. 60.Animadv. p. 104. Where he speaketh of the church of Rome being dead long agoe in her sinnes Rev. 20, 5. vvith Ephes. 2, 1.) he had also the like before, of apostate Is∣raell being dead in their sinnes, Hos. 3, 1. Animad. p. 70. Where let the Reader see, what I haue noted thereabout, here before, pag. 87, 88. &c. Besides that if this death, be (asM Bright M. Forbes, &c. on Rev. 20, 5. some think) the apostasie spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 3. we must then remember vvithal, that this apostasie is in the Temple of God 2 Thes. 2, 4. like as there vvas apostasie in Iudah and Israell heretofore: and that difference therefore is to be put between Gods temple, & the apostasie it self; as between Iudah and Israell, and their apostasie; Ezech. 16, and 23. with 1 King. 15, 34. and 2 King. 21, 11. betvveen the Lords courts, & the Gentiles domineering therein; Rev. 11, 2. and betvveen Gods people, and the for∣mer and later Babylon, spoken off Jer. 51, 45. and Rev. 18, 4. And moreover
also, that the dead (spoken off in the place here alledged by himself) liue a∣gaine and reigne with Christ after the finishing of a thousand yeres, Rev. 20, 5. where∣as he speaketh of the church of Rome, as being gone long since, damned, and dead for ever. Animadv. p. 98, 102, 104. So as euen this Scripture, which him∣self citeth (if it be well observed) vvilbe found to be against himself: and that other place likevvise which he citeth, touching another death (which may be understood of the plague) and the utter burning of Babylon with fire, when the smoke of her burning shall be seen to ascend, as did the smoke of Sodome, like the smoke of a furnace. Rev. 18, 7, 8, 9, 18. with Gen. 19, 28. vvhich the Scripture it self referreth & applieth to the City, that great city, resembled by Babylon, and Babylons destruction, that was of old: from vvhich it shall never rise: Rev. 18, 2, 19, 20, 21. with Jer. 50, and 51 chapt. Which vengeance on that great city Babylon, the Lord God, that is strong, will certainly take and accomplish. And then shall vve be so farre from mourning at her funeral, as we shal rejoiceRev. 18, 20. with the heuenly multitude, & sing Hallelujah, when the Lord hath giuenGen. 19, 28. Sodoms judgment on her, and vve see her smoke rise up for evermore. Rev. 19, 1, 2, 3. In the meane time, (touching the church, Temple, and people of God) as M. Iunius di∣stinguishing betvveen the Temple of God, & the apostasie of Antichrist, helped forvvard the consuming of the one, and prayed for grace & mer∣cy to the other: so doe we also humbly beseech the Lord, with mercy to behold and care for his church, and whatsoever belongeth thereunto; & dayly to call and deliver out of Babylon his people al, increasing his mer∣cies and graces upon them, to the edification of his church, the salvation of all his people, and the praise of the glorie of his grace for evermore. Amen. And thus much concerning M. Iunius his treatise of the church of Rome. Where about I haue vvritten much more then at first I purposed: considering on one hand, how godly and learned he vvas, and being now deceased can not ansvver for himself; and on another hand hovv unwor∣thily this Opposite hath dealt vvith him: vvho if he could haue ansvvered him, should haue done it soundly, remembring stil with whom he did en∣counter; if not, he should haue layd his hand on his mouth, & kept him∣self silent: and that vvould haue ben accounted unto him for wisedome. 61. Together with M. JuniusAdvert. pag. 113. was alledged also the testimonie of A∣mandus Polanus (another godly and learned man) vvho said that Antichrist must sit in the Temple of God (2 Thes. 2, 4.) not Jewish or at Ierusalem, but Christian, that is, in the Christian church. Polan. on Ezech. 39. pag. 733. M. Ains. answereth He vvas mistaken.Animadv. p. 104. 105 The same, that Bellarmine and other Papists ansvver the Protestants hereabout. Bellarm. de Pontif. Rom. lib. 3, cap. 13. Rhem. Annot. on 2 Thes. 2. sect. 11. Behold, vvhither M. Ains. now is caried. Polanus moreover for further confirmation of his assertion, alledged Chrysostome, Theophylact, Ambrose, Hilarie, Jerome, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas also: referring the Reader for their testimonies, to his Catholick Symphonie, chap. 24. Thes. 3. And therevvithall vve adjoyned the
testimonie of Keckerman (a good writer also of this age, who speaking of the popish church, saith, It is not a pure church, but very corrupt, like as a rotten ap∣ple is in deed an apple, but corrupt: and as a man infected with the plague is a man, but not a sound man. Keckerm. Praepar. ad sacram synaxin. pag, 83.Ibid. Now M. Ainsvv. an∣svvers all alike, that they are mistaken, in judging of that rotten church. So (in his judgment) all are mistaken hereabout, but himself and his follovvers; vvho are mistaken most of all, and yet will not see and acknovvledge it, though it be shevved unto them. 62. Last of all, to countenance his cause the more (that I may use his owne vvords) he sets it out vvith the name and judgment ofAnimad. p. 105, &c many learned men, specially of our ovvn countrey, M. Cartwright, M. Perkins, D. Fulk, D. Wil∣let, and M. Bale, vvho are novv deceased (all of them, saue one:) to vvhose judgment in other things he would be loath to stand. So novv himself doth that, vvhich here before he carped at, or blamed in us. Animad. p 98. For the men themselues, they vvere in deed learned and godly: and to their writings, in many things vve condescend: but vvish that in some things they had spoken more advisedly, and vvritten more soundly, then they haue done. To rip up particulars vvherein they erred, I am loath: having both reverend estimation of the men, and knowing that none li∣veth, vvho is not subject to erre in some things, seeing we al know but in part. 1 Cor. 13, 9. Yet that the trueth may better be searched out, and no vvay praejudiced by the names and judgment of these learned men: I haue thought it not amisse, briefly to note thus much touching the points in hand, and their sayings here produced, being compared vvith other speaches of theirs othervvhere: that if the Reader doe vvell mynd them, he shall find some of their assertions to be erroneous, & very grounds of Anabaptistrie, some to be doubtfully spoken by them, and some vvith crossing of themselues and one another; besides that sundry things which properly and directly concern the man of sinne, they apply to the church and Temple of God it self, not distinguishing things aright, as they might and should haue done: Which M. IuniusSee here before, p. 184. noteth particularly, to be a spe∣ciall meanes, whereby many are deceived hereabout. M. Cartwright (he saith) vvrote that the children of Papists are not in the co∣venant of God. T. C. Reply 1, p. 173. How came himself then, and the refor∣med churches, under Gods covenant, being descended of Papists? Or vvere they baptized, before they vvere under Gods covenant? Or shall we think, that apostate christians are not answerable to the apostate Isra∣elites of Iudah and the ten tribes, among vvhom (in the time of their apo∣stasie) God continued his covenant, and circumcision the signe thereof? Finally, how then is it true that D. Raynolds saith, thoughD. Rayn. fift Conclu∣sion: joyned with Harts conference, pag. 657. the Romanists haue greatly & grievously hurt baptisme with their annoyances, yet the substance there∣of, and as it were the life, hath ben preserved whole and sound through Gods mercy? If their children be not in the covenant of God, how hath the substance and life of baptisme ben preserved sound among them by the mercy of God? But of this, I haue spoken sufficiently here before, p. 28, 35, 58, &c. 121, &c.
M. Cartwright also (saith he) writes, that the church of Rome is no church. T.C. Reply 2. p. 146. How then is it the Temple of God, where Antichrist sit∣teth? 2 Thes. 2, 4. or the Court of the Temple, and holy city, trode downe by the Gentiles, two and fourty moneths? Rev. 11, 2. And vvhy doth M. Perkins say (as here he alledgeth) thatIn his ex∣pos. of the Creed, tit. church. Animadv. p. 106. it is no true or sound member of the ca∣tholick church? According to M. Cartwrights speach, he should haue said, it is no member of the Catholick church at al. Or when D. Raynolds di∣sputeth, that the church of Rome is not a sound member of the catholick church, doth he meane, that it is no member at all thereof? Hovv then saith he, that the substance and life of baptisme hath ben preserved whole and sound therein through the mercy of God, as is aforesaid. But of this also ynough is spoken here be∣fore, pag. 120, &c. D. Fulk (he saith)In his an∣swer to the Counterf. Catholick. Art. 11. tels the Papists, that they haue nothing in deed, but the Syna∣gogue of Sathan. Yet D. Fulk otherwhere answering the Rhemes Annota∣tions on 2 Thes. 2, 4. first tels the Papists, thatSect. 11. the church of Christ is by the A∣postle called the Temple of God, 1 Cor. 3, 16, 17. 2 Cor. 6. Rev. 3, 12. wherefore (saith he, speaking novv doubtfully) the Apostle meaneth, that Antichrist shal sit in the visible church of God, or that which is so called and commonly reputed. And after∣ward, vvhen he hath shevved the judgment of divers auncient writers thereabout, tels the Papists plainly,Ibid. sect. 12. Thus you see by the most & best approved Authors judgment, Antichrist should sit in the church of God. If then it be the church of God, haue they nothing in deed, but the Synagogue of Sathan? D. Willet (he saith)Synopsis Papismi. Cōtr. 2. of the church. q. 5. par. 2. utterly denyeth that they are a true visible church of Christ. But doe any of his arguments proue it? Let the Reader consider, & mark it with judgment. Again he saithIbid. Cō∣trov. 4. q. 10. part. 5. 2 Thes. 2. he shall sit in the Temple of God, that is, the visible church, that which sometime vvas a true visible one, as the Church of Rome, and after should so be taken, reputed and challenged, as it is at this day by the Papists. Yet a litle after in the same place he saith, Paul speaketh not here, of any materiall Temple, but of the church of God: neyther doth S. Paul in this sense refuse to use the name of Temple, as 1 Cor. 3, 16. and 6, 19. and in other places. Now if the name of the Temple of God be so used by the Apostle in the other place of 2 Thes. 2, 4. as it is here, in these places, 1 Cor. 3, 16. and 6, 19. and otherwhere: then it signifieth the church and Temple of God, not onely that is so ta∣ken and reputed, but that is so in deed. For so in these other places it is understood. Moreover, when M. Willet proveth the churches of the Pro∣testants, and namely the church of England, to be true visible churches, he useth this for his first argument.Ibid. cō∣trov. 2, q. 5 part. 2. That church which sendeth sorth Martyrs, as Christs faithfull souldjours, is the true church. This Proposition (saith he) I think, is not doubted off: for out of the church there are no Martyrs. If this then be an un∣doubted argument, eyther he must shevv that the church of Rome affor∣deth no Martyrs against the Turks, and other professed enemies of the Christian faith: or if it do, he yeelds, it must needs be the church of God. M. Bale noteth divers things, vvhichImage of both chur∣ches, in the Prof. apperteyn to the man of sinne, & plainly shew, that the Pope is Antichrist: As, vvhere he saith, The Pope ma∣keth his boast, that he is the high Priest, he is of equal power with Peter, he cannot erre,
he is head and spouse of the Church, &c. But difference is to be put betweene the Temple of God, and Antichrist the man of sinne sitting therein, &c. as hath ben often shewed here before, pag. 125, 137, 183, &c. Besides, speaking of the Turk, he saith, he will in no case grant Christ to be the sonne of God, nor that he dyed here for mans redemption. Yet both these are acknovvledged by the church of Rome, as I haue shewed here before, by their ovvne profes∣sion. Pag. 122. Other things that might further be observed out of those mens wri∣tings about the assertions aforesaid, I will not insist upon. It may suffice, that M. Ainsvv. himself saith here,Animad. pag. 105. it is not to be marveled at, though vvise and godly men be mistaken, for in many things we sinne all Jam. 3, 2. And good it were for this man himself and his followers, that they had this wisedome and godlynes, in synceritie and humblenes of mind thus to think & acknow∣ledge of themselues, that they are mistaken, and sinne in many things: then would they not be so stif, and self conceited in their fore-conceived opinions & former practises, euen vvhen better is shewed unto them, by the vvord of God. Now having thus treated of the points aforesaid, and of the understan∣ding of that Scripture, 2 Thes. 2, 4. touching Antichrist sitting in the Tem∣ple of God: I vvill by this occasion yet further (before I conclude) an∣nex herevvithall the judgment and testimonie both of auncient and later Writers, concerning these things, not naming all that might be alledged, but a few onely of each sort: as follovveth. Testimonies of auncient Writers. Chrysostome (speaking of Antichrist) saith, He shall sit in the Temple of God, not that which is at Ierusalem, but in the Temple of the church. Chrysost. homil. 3, in Epist. ad Thes. 2. Theophylact saith, Not in the Temple, which is at Ierusalem specially, but simply in the churches, and in every Temple of God. In 2 Thes. 2. Oecumenius hath likewise, He saith not the Temple of Ierusalem, but the chur∣ches. In 2 Thes. 2. Item Severianus apud Oecumenium, ibid. Theodoret saith, He calleth the Temple of God, the churches, in which Antichrist shall arrogate unto himself the chief seat. In 2 Thes. 2. Augustine saith, The Temple of any Idoll or Divell, the Apostle would not call the Temple of God. De civit. Dei, l. 20, c. 19. Whereof also see here before, p. 147. Ambrose likewise saith, So that in the house of God, he sitteth in the seat of Christ. In 2 Thes. 2. Testimonies of later Writers. &c. Calvin saith, Paul placeth not Antichrist any otherwhere, then in the verie Sanctuarie of God. 2 Thes. 2, 4. Of which also see more here before, pag. 164. Hemmingius saith, By these marks (spoken off 2 Thes. 2, 4.) is signified, that Antichrist is not any one properly out of the visible church. Ibid in 2 Thes. 2. Iunius saith, That the papacie is in the church, as the order or estate of apostasie in the house of
and city of God, is as certaine, as that of the Apostle is certain, 2 Thes. 2. that the man of sinne, the sonne of perdition sitteth in the Temple of God, with his whole order or estate of apostates. Lib. singulari de Ecclesia contra Bellarm. cap. 17. In fol. pag. 1020. Of which poynt, and many o∣ther things concerning this matter, see more here before, pag. 183. &c. Zanchius saith,] I agree not vvith them, that think the church of Rome hath ceased to be the church of Christ, aswell as the east churches, which afterward became Mahumetane. What church ever was more corrupt, then the church of the ten tribes? Yet by the Scriptures we haue learned, that it vvas the church of God. And how hath Paul cald the Church, wherein the said Antichrist should sit, the Temple of God? Neyther is it Baptisme that is administred out of the Church of Christ. Neyther doth a wife cease to be a vvife, because she is an adulteresse: except she be manifestly divorced, being deprived of the ring, the pledge of the mariage covenant. The Church of Rome therefore is yet the church of Christ. But vvhat a church? So corrupt, so de∣praved, and oppressed with such tyrannie, as vve neither can with good conscience pertake of their holy things, nor safely dwell among them. In Praefat. librorum de Natura Dei. Polanus saith,] A particular church is either pure, or impure. A pure church, is a companie of such as haue the true religion uncorrupted. &c. It is very commonly called a true church, but by a Synecdoche. For everie pure church of God is also a true church: but everie true church is not alway pure: except that true and pure be taken for all one, as very often it is. Like as all pure gold is taken for true gold; but all true gold is not alway pure: for gold mixed with drosse, is in deed true gold, but is not yet pure, till it be severed from the drosse. A leprous man also is a true man, but not pure or cleane. So is the church of Rome as yet a Christian church, but le∣prous and most impure. I will speak it more plainly: A true Church is so called ambiguously: eyther as it is opposed to an impure church, or as it is opposed to a false church. If a church be said to be a true one, as it is opposed to that which is impure, then it is al one as pure and ortho∣doxe. But if it be opposed to a false, and therefore no church, then it is not all one as pure. For at the time when Christ was borne and lived on the earth, the church of the Iewes vvas a true church of God, but it vvas not pure: because it vvas corrupt both in the doctrine and discipline thereof. And except these things be distinguished, it will follow that there hath ben some time, when there was no true church of God in the world: vvhich is most absurd. Polani Syntag. in fol. tomb. 2. libr. 7. cap. 8. pag. 544. And a litle after again, An impure Church, is a company wherein religion is corrupt. And it is eyther lesse impure, or more impure, or most impure of all. &c. The church of Rome at this day is yet the church of Christ (but most impure of all, but most corrupt of all, and almost giving up the ghost:) because there is yet in it God calling, there are in it the called, and calling, which constitute a church; because it reteyneth yet somewhat of the doctrine of Christ, though mixed with many errors, and because it reteyneth Baptisme the signe of Christianitie, in the substantiall forme thereof, though defiled with many blemishes and corruptions: as also because it reteyneth yet some invocation of Christ the mediatour: Other∣wise they that are baptised in Poperie, should be baptised out of the church, and therefore not with the baptisme of Christ. Briefly, the church of Rome at this day hath all things corrupted, but not altogether. As of old the church of Ierusalem, so at this day the Church of Rome, is like unto a vineyard, which Christ fenced about with a wall, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vines, and built a tower in the midst of it, and made a wine presse therein: but it brought not forth grapes, but wild grapes. Esa. 5, 1. &c. For the church of Rome is to be distinguished from the Popes Church or faction of Antichrist, which prevaileth in the church of Rome, and will not suffer them that profes Christ more purely, but labours to oppresse them, that it alone may haue al. &c. Seing therefore the church of Rome at this day is most im∣pure, and the popes church is that spirituall Babylon, it is altogether to be forsaken, as the spirit of God commandeth Revel. 18, 4. Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her sinnes, and that ye receiue not of her plagues. Ibid. pag. 549, 550. [More al so he hath herea∣bout, in his vvritings otherwhere. Of which, & of Keckermans testimo∣nie vvithall, see here before, p. 178, and 208, and 209. & in the Advertism. pag. 113. Paraeus saith,] The Iesuites accuse us, that we haue made a division, departing from the church. But we haue not departed from the church, but from the Papacie: we came out of Babylon, at the Lords commandement, who saith, Come out of her my people. Paraeus in Rom. 16.18. Piscator saith,] The Temple of Salomon was a type of three things: First, of the body of Christ, as appeareth by his words, Iohn 2, 19. and by Pauls words, Col. 2, 9. Secondly, of the Church, as appeareth by the words of Paul, 2 Thes. 2, 4. also by the words of Peter, 1 Pet. 2, 5. and by the
words of Iohn, Rev. 3, 12. Thirdly, of each of the faithful, as Pauls words shew, 1 Cor. 3, 16. & 6, 19. & 2 Cor. 6, 16. Piscat. Obser. in 1 Reg. 6. c. [Again he saith,] Paul describeth Antichrist, first by his wickednes, calling him a man of sinne, that is, wholy giuen unto sinne; secondly, by the pu∣nishment that shal come upon him according to the decree of God, calling him the sonne of per∣dition, that is, appointed by God to perdition or eternall destruction; thirdly, by his intollerable impudencie and pride, that he shall oppose himself against Christ, and exalt himself aboue God himself; fourthly, by the place, where he shall rule & exercise his tyrannie, to wete, in the temple of God, that is, in the church. Piscat. Analys, in 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. M. Bradford, a faithfull martyr of our own countrey, disputing with the Bishop of Chichester, saith,] That wicked man sitteth in the Temple of God, that is, the church: for it cannot be un∣derstood of Mahomet, or any out of the church, but of such as beare rule in the church. Act. and Monum. pag. 1616. M. Brightman treating of Antichrist, speaketh very often of his sitting and dominering in the church. As when he saith,] The Dragon is the open enemie, throughout this book, who were the Emperors of Rome, as long as they remayned heathens. The Turks play this part in these last ages. The Beast is a more close and craftie enemie, who is Antichrist that sitteth in the Temple of God, Brightm. on Rev. 16, 13. In the English, pag. 552. [Againe,] To be extolled a∣boue all that is called God, or that is worshipped, is not to be extolled aboue that one God in heauen, but aboue everie God in earth, that is, aboue all magistrates; not onely those that be of the inferior sort, but also aboue all that Majestie that is soveraigne amongst men, the highest Em∣perors themselues, who are called Augusti in Latin, as they be Sebastoi in Greek, of the high reve∣rence and worship that is done to them. Lastly, as touching the true God, if Antichrist should acknowledge no other God but himself, how should he sit in the Temple of God, as the Apostle saith, he should sit, 2 Thes. 2, 4. M. Brightm. treatise of Antichrist, against Bellar. on Rev. 17, ch. 1. pag. 628, 629. [And again,] He should not deny the Father openly, seing that by this meanes he should be openly known to be an Atheist: which is contrary to that which the Apostle teacheth, who saith, that he should sit in the Temple of God. Ibid. p. 629, 630. [And again,] There is not one litle word left for you out of the Scriptures, which can teach that Antichrist shalbe a certain or singular man, after the right manner of concluding: but we haue demonstrated out of them most certainly, that he is that Apostaticall Sea of those, that shal dominere in the church. Ibid. chap. 2, p. 642. And the like he hath often othervvhere. M. Robbinson also saith,] The constitution euen of Rome (as now it stands) is not simply false, but onely in this and that respect. Iustif. of Separat. pag. 88. And many moe I might alledge, of all sorts of Writers and Witnesses: but these may suffice. Yea it is ynough alone, that Gods Word doth so teach and confirme it, as before is manifested. The Conclusion. HItherto of these things concerning the Church of Rome. Wherea∣bout I haue vvritten the more largely, to help forvvard (what in me is) the better searching out, and more clearing of the truth, both against Poperie on the one hand, and Anabaptistrie on the other. For with the Papists, there is nothing more common, in pleading for the estate of that church, then thus to reason and aske, Seeing it is granted, that the church of Rome was the church of God in the Apostles times, when vvas it since that she ceased so to be? In which of the Centuries after Christ? In what Popes dayes, &c. Whereunto some answer, about 300 yeres after Christ, vvhen at the Nicene Councell the primacie of that Sea vvas so and so acknovvledged; some think sooner, straight after the Apostles dayes; some later, about four hundred yeeres after Christ, others about fiue, & some about six hundred after Christ, &c.
Hereupon the Papists insult, and both harden themselues, and trouble o∣thers very much hereabout. On the other hand, the Anabaptists taking it for graunted, that the church of Rome is not the church of God, they cast avvay the baptisme there re∣ceived, and professe to begin all anevv, and therefore are againe baptized anevv, and so proceed on in their course, as best liketh themselues: being therein more hardened by others, vvho also say, that the Church of Rome is not the church of God, neither their baptisme true baptisme, but an Idoll, and lying signe, a cursed and detestable Sacrament, &c. Thus errors and evils increase on all hands: whereas the way, both soundly to ansvver the Papists, and rightly to prevent the Anabaptists errors and evil courses, is to ansvver, that the church of Rome, is yet stil the church of God, but in apostasie; the temple of God, but wherein the Man of sinne sitteth, &c. And therefore as it is the church & Temple of God, to acknowledge it, to reteyn the baptisme, and vvhatsoever ordinance or truth of God, they haue yet among them: but as it hath the man of sinne set therein, as it is in apostasie from the faith, vvorship, order and government, wherein at first it vvas set (as may sufficiently appeare by comparing their present estate, with the Epistles vvritten by the Apostle to the Romanes, and the other Primitiue Chur∣ches, &c) so to leaue and vvitnesse against all the apostasie, iniquitie, mix∣tures and corruptions thereof: and to returne to the auncient and good vvay, vvherein the Church of Rome with the other Churches aforesaid were first planted by the Apostles. Of vvhich point, I shall (God willing) by other occasion speak more hereafter. In the meane time (as I noted before) remember stil to distinguish be∣tvveen the Temple of God, and the man of sinne set therein, between the church it self, and the apostasie thereof: like as betvveene the Temple at Ierusalem, and the idols of abomination that were set therein, betvveen the church of Israell, and the defection thereof. Which did not hinder, but that yet still it vvas the Temple and church of God, though corrupted and defiled, so as none could lawfully in that estate eyther minister there, or bring their sacrifices thither: but the godly chose rather that Ie∣rusalem should be filled vvith their innocent blood, then that they vvould sinne and defile themselues vvith the worship and abomination there used and urged upon them. 2 King 21, 1 — 16. and 24, 4. Remember also still to apply unto Antichrist, what the Scripture hath otherwhere of the Beast, of the Gentiles, of Sodome, Egypt, Babylon, &c. And refer what it hath of the temple of God, of the court of the temple, of the holy City, and the like, to the church of God, either more syncere, or more corrupt, in defection, or othervvise. Consider withall, if where∣as the termes of a true or false Church are commonly used, and many times not rightly understood or applied, it would not be good and profi∣table for discerning of the different estate of Churches aright, to use the termes of syncere,Esai. 1, 21. or corrupt; pure, or impure; intire, or apostate; faith∣full, or adulterate, &c. And these also vvith degrees: as some more syn∣cere,
and some lesse; some more corrupt, and some lesse, &c. Which be∣ing vvell observed, vvould giue great light, for understanding and obser∣ving things aright, both for judgement and practise: to eschevv the er∣rors and evils into vvhich so many fall, some on the right hand, and some on the left. Finally, the due observation of these things, vvil shew us both vvhy and how to leaue the present estate and apostasie of the church of Rome, & to returne to the auncient estate and integrity thereof: reteyning vvhatsoe∣ver they haue that is the Lords, according to his vvord; and renouncing vvhatsoever mixtures or corruptions they haue brought in of their own, vvhether concerning the faith, or the order of the church. This also (I trust) may be a meanes, by the blessing of God, to stirre up both Papists, Anabaptists, and others that are any vvay so inclined, more carefully to consider their vvaies and estate in their heart, and speedily to turne their feet into the vvay and testimonies of the Lord. Psal. 119, 59, 60. Which grace the Lord in mercy vouchsafe unto them. And thus much touching the church of Rome, and the matters aforesaid perteyning thereunto. Touching the Church of England. NOvv whereas our opposites hold also, that the church of England is not the church of God, nor hath the covenant of God; and the Ba∣ptisme there received is not true baptisme, but an idol, & lying signe, &c. their opinions are here again in many respects far more erroneous, and ungodly then before. For hovv ever some heretofore not regarding a∣right the faith there professed, and lothing the corruptions there reteyn∣ed, haue misconceived some things concerning them and their estate: Yet now that there hath ben longer time and more occasion further to consider thereof; seeing also into vvhat extremities divers of our coun∣treymen that are become Anabaptists haue by this meanes the more run themselues; and specially considering the doctrine of faith which they professe in Christ alone unto salvation: it should teach al, more advised∣ly and heedfully to regard their estate in this behalf, & to acknowledge them to be the people and churches of God, having the covenant & ba∣ptisme of the Lord, &c. To insist further upon particular reasons herea∣bout, I need not: divers haue ben notedPag. 30, &c. & 58 &c. and 121. &c. here before: where vve haue also shevved, that euen the church of Rome, is the church and Temple of God: as Iudah likevvise and Israell of old vvere in the time of their apo∣stasies. How much more then should we so esteem of the church of Eng∣land (yea and of the Lutherans) vvho haue in so many things novv left the apostasie of the church of Rome, and haue received the doctrine of justifi∣cation by faith in Christ alone, vvith many other precious doctrines of truth, that are yet still miserably depraved and corrupted among the Papists. But hereupon some object and say, If they be the church of God, none may
leaue them; it is schisme for any to leaue those that are the churches and people of God; and vvhy then doe you not continew Ministers and members there still? &c. First, to this objection I haue ansvvered before, pag. 116, &c. To vvhich I referre the Reader: as also to that which M. Iunius hath written concerning this matter: as may be seen here before, pag. 184, 186. Secondly, if this objection were sound, then might none leaue the pre∣sent estate of the church of Rome, seeing they are the church and Temple of God, as before hath ben declared. Yet the men that doe thus object, haue many of them left it themselues. And M. Iunius shevveth, that both these may stand vvel together: to esteem it to be the church of God, and yet to leaue & forsake it in their estate: yea that it is our duty so to doe. But in deed (to note this by the vvay) wel may it be, that some Protestant writers, otherwise of great & good judgment, haue heretofore the more denied it to be the Church of God, because they thought if that were granted, it vvould then follow to be schisme for any to leaue it, as the Pa∣pists themselues are vvoont usually to object. But the consequence is not good: as is shewed before by the Scriptures and examples both in Iudah and Israell, &c. Pag. 116. Thirdly, in a Church there are tvvo things specially that are still to be respected, the faith and the order thereof. Col. 2, 5. For touching the worship of God therein, it may in divers respects be referred to the one, or to the other, or to both of them. Novv for the Faith, which is in Christ alone to salvation, we acknowledge that they professe it soundly; and in the unity thereof vve also hope our selues to be saved with them: and therefore (albeit they intreat & deale yll with us sundry vvaies, yet) we hold them to be our brethren in the Lord, and in the faith of his Gospell. But as for the churches order, worship, and government ecclesiasticall: vve hold and professe, that they stand yet still greatly corrupted, and transgressing the second commandement, many waies: As namely,Of these more parti∣cularly see in the Apo¦logie, and other Trea∣tises of ours: also in the Trea¦tise here following touching the refor∣med chur∣ches. in their Prelacie, and inferi∣our ministerie; in their Canons, Constitutions, and Worship devised and imposed by man; especially in the Book of common prayer, according to which all the ministers and people of that Church are enjoyned to mini∣ster and partake of the holy things of God had among them: vvherein are corruptions not a few, that are also observed and written againstThe A∣bridgement of the Mi∣nisters book of Lincolne Diocesse. The Survey of the book of Common praier, &c by divers of themselues; besides the refusal, opposition, & persecution of the trueth, vvhich hath now a long time very often & many vvaies benshew∣ed unto them, &c. And yet more specially, that the particular churches & ministers thereof stand not, as the primitue Churches and Pastors did, immediately under Iesus Christ the Archpastor (as touching their eccle∣siasticall constitution) but under another spirituall authoritie and Prelacie devised by man; neyther haue povver in themselues (as now they stand) to receiue and practise all the ordinances of God, & to redresse all errors and corruptions, that are manifested unto them by the vvord of God: as the Pastors and Churches aforesaid had. Which things standing thus, hereby may appeare, that none can stand Ministers or members of the
Church aforesaid in their estate, and performe the dueties thereof accor∣ding to the Lavves and Constitution thereof: but they shall sinne, and transgresse the second Commandement. Which the Lord, that is a jelous God, accounteth to be hatred of him, and hath threatned severely to pu∣nish: as on the contrarie he hath promised to shew mercy graciously to them that loue him and keep his commandements. Exod. 20, 4, 5, 6. compa∣red with Lev. 10, 1, 2. Deut. 4, 1, 2. 2 King. 10, 18 — 31. 2 Chron. 19, 2, 3. Luke 19, 27. Psal. 119, 126, 127, 128. Esa. 29, 13. and 65, 2. Mal. 1, 6 — 14. Mar. 7, 4, 6, 7. &c. Col. 2, 20— 23. Rev. 14, 9 — 12. and 22, 18, 19. Fourthly (which commeth to a like end vvith the former reason, but yet vvill make it more plaine) there are two things concerning the vvor∣ship and service of God, which we ought alwaies carefully to remember and obserue. One, that we ought to leaue and forsake all the inventions of men, and more specially al the mixtures and corruptions of Antichrist the man of sinne, in the service and worship of God: And this not onely in things concerning the faith, but in such also as concerne the order of the church. Exod. 20, 4, 5. with Deut. 12, 32. Iudg. 8, 27. 1 Chro. 13. & 15, 2. &c. 2 Chron. 33, 17. Psal. 119, 101, 113, 128. Esa. 30, 21, 22. Ezech. 43, 8. Mal. 1, 6 — 14. Matt. 15, 9, 13, 14. Rom. 16, 17. Rev. 14, 9 — 12. and 22, 18, 19. The other is, that vve obserue and practise all the commandements and ordinances of the Lord, vvhich he hath (once for all) giuen unto his church: vvhether con∣cerning the faith, or the order of the church: and so consequently the Churches government, vvorship, ministerie, & ministration of all & eve∣ry of the holy things of God, according to his vvord. Exod. 20, 6. compared with Deut. 12, 32. Matth. 28, 20. Gal. 3, 15. Jude v. 3. 1 Tim. 6, 13, 14. 2 Chron. 13, 8 — 12. and 19, 8 — 11. Psal. 119, 101, 128. Esa. 30, 21. and 33, 22. Rev. 14, 12. Which two things, seeing that in the present estate of the church of England nei∣ther ministers nor members can obserue them, nor be suffred peaceably so to vvalke: hovv can it be but we must needs leaue that estate, unlesse vve should still continew in sinne, against the Law of God? And hovv can that justly be counted schisme, vvhich is our bounden duty to the Lord, vvherein vve ought to obey God, rather then Man? Fiftly (to make the matter yet more plaine) let us put the case, that some Kings and States vvould permit the Churches in their dominions peaceably to enjoy the ministerie of the word, and the Baptisme of elder people among them, but not of children: urging those words according to the letter, Make disciples, and baptise them, Matt. 28, 19. Or if of younger persons also, yet vvould not suffer any to haue the Lords supper at all, because of the many questions and troubles that haue ben and yet are among the Papists, Lutherans, and other Protestants thereabout: Novv hereupon I would aske, vvhether it should be sinne and schisme to leaue such an estate, and to obserue also Gods ordinance of the Lords supper, according to his institution? Or if any vvould permit the use of it, but onely under one kind: Or if in both kinds, to wit, both with bread & wine, yet vvould not admit it vvithout the acknowledgment of Tran∣substantiation,
or at least of Consubstantiation, pressing still those vvords, This is my body, &c. Matth. 26, 26. Or would not haue it admini∣stred according to the simplicity of the Gospell, but as Princes or people did themselues like best to haue it: Or admitting both preaching of the vvord and ministration of the Sacraments, yet would haue al, though ne∣ver so profane and notoriously vvicked, to be partakers of the Lords Table, and not to be censured, admonished, debarred, excommunica∣ted, &c. Or would not suffer the people to chuse their ovvne Officers, according to the word of God: or the Officers not to performe the dueties vvhich God requireth at their hands, but at the pleasure of man, Princes or people, or at least of the greater part of the people, urging those vvords, Tell the church, &c. Matth. 18, 17. and, All things are yours, &c. 1 Cor. 3, 21, 22, 23. Or finally and summarily, vvould not suffer the Chur∣ches, the ministers, and people, to obserue whatsoever Christ hath commanded, Matth. 28, 20. but if they had the word preached, would not suffer the seales of Gods mercy, the Sacraments, one or both to be enjoyed; or if they had both these, vvould not permit the Lords disci∣pline to be had, the censures and sanctions of his judgment, according to his word and instistution, &c. Whether novv (I say) in these and such like cases, we should not obey God rather then man: and whether it be schisme and sinne so to doe? Sixtly, the church of England it self, and all the reformed churches and Protestants at this day, are charged by the Papists to be schismaticks, for leaving the present estate of the church of Rome. But are they therefore so in deed? Sundry Protestant Writers haue shewed good reasons to the contrarie: divers of vvhich (being indifferently vveighed) may be applied to the points & case now treated off: (albeit withal I acknowledge great and unspeakable difference to be between the estate of these churches: & blesse God daily for the many good things had in the church of England, & (for that they haue left the church of Rome.) For which see particularly of our ovvn countreymen) D. Raynolds sixt Conclusion: eyther in Latin, or as it is in English joyned with his Conference vvith Hart, pag. 666, 667, &c. And D. Willets Synopsis Papismi, in fol. pag. 608, 609. &c. Lastly, vvhereas Conformity is much urged; and such as doe not con∣forme themselues, are charged vvith schisme (vvhether they remayne in that church, or leaue the present estate thereof, that they may keep the ordinances of God according to his vvord:) vve are still to remember, that there is a double Conformitie, touching the outward worship of God; The one is that Conformitie of rites and order, which the Lord re∣quireth and prescribeth in his word; The other is the conformity vvhich the lavves and constitutions of men ordeyn and require. To the former, all are bound: and unto it the Lord hath giuen his promise. Matth. 28, 18, 19, 20. 1 Tim. 6, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14. compared with Exod. 20, 4, 5, 6. Deut. 12, 32. Mal. 1, 7 — 14. Where Piscator well observeth, that in the outward worship of God there is required both a conformitie of rite agreeing with the prescript of Gods comman∣dement;
and synceritie in all which performe that worship to the Lord. Piscat. Observ. in Mal. 1, 7, &c. To the latter, we are bound no further or othervvise then as it agreeth with the conformitie prescribed by the Lord himself, because vve must worship the Lord onely as he hath appointed in his vvord, and as we haue the promise of his acceptance and blessing therewithall. For which, see the Scriptures aforesaid, and Deut. 4, 1, 2. Psal. 119, 101, 128. Esa. 29, 13. & 30; 21, 22. Matth. 15, 9. Hos. 4, 15, 17. Amos 5, 4, 5. 2 Cor. 6, 14, 15, 16, 17. Col. 2, 23. Rev. 22, 18, 19. Some other things perteyning hereunto, see also before, pag. 116, 117, &c. and in the third Treatise here following. Now if any aske vvhether that Christians and Churches may not and ought not to beare one with another, in their differences: of this also I haue spoken here before, pag. 118, and 119, &c. the brief summe whereof is this, that we may and should so doe, vvhen the Churches and Pastors thereof professing the faith of Christ, stand (in their ecclesiasticall estate) immediately under Iesus Christ; having libertie & power in themselues, to receiue any truth, and redres any error or evil, as they shalbe perswa∣ded thereof; and in the meane time doe not urge others to sinne in their owne persons, but suffer them peaceably to practise and walk in the vvay and order, which the Lord hath prescribed in his word. Which if it vvere the estate & dealing of the churches in England and other the like at this day, the question would (in divers respects) be othervvise, for esteeming of them, and vvalking with them, then novv it is. And these are the things which I thought here to note (by this occasi∣on) touching the church of England, in regard of the points in question betvveen us, & the Anabaptists, & others to much overcaried that way. Other things there are also good to be considered off: as namely, the di∣vers degrees of Gods manifesting the truth, and consuming of Antichrist with his apostasie; the different estate and proceeding of the Angels, spo∣ken off, Rev. 14, 6, 8, 9, 15, 17. &c. and 15. and 16 chap. &c. the difference of ordinarie and extraordinarie estate and calling; the divers considerati∣on of spirituall, and bodily or personall communion; the distinction of Provinciall, Diocesan, and particular churches, vvith the Bishops thereof; Also whether the particular churches among them, be not become parts and members of the Diocesan and Provinciall churches, in their estate; Whether the prelates bereaue not the particular churches of many rights perteyning unto them, & more particularly take away from them some speciall rights and dueties of the Pastors, ruling Elders, people, and (in some respects) of al estates generally among them: Finally, whether such Ministers as haue left the corruptions of that estate, and liue in Churches rightly established, may not yet notvvithstanding upon occasion1 King. 13 chap. Hos. 5, 9. & 7, 12. Amo. 7, 13 Rev. 14, 6. &c. preach in the other churches aforesaid, both to shevv them their sinnes and ab∣errations, & to teach them the truth & vvay of Iesus Christ, in all things, more and more, &c. But of these things now I treat not. Onely I thought here, to note these heads in generall: which may giue occasion to others
and my self to consider more thereabout: although that of some of them I shall hereafter speak somewhat more particularly, in the Treatise fol∣lowing, concerning the Reformed Churches. And thus much here, of the Church of England, by this occasion. This suit, we intreat such as take knowledge hereof, and haue accesse to his Maje∣stie & their Honours, to motion for us, and to further what in them is. Prov. 24, 10, 11, 12. & 31, 8, 9. Ier. 38, 7 — 13. & 30, 15 — 18. Mat. 25, 31. &c.Novv to conclude with suit to his Majestie, & the honourable LL. my humble suit is (as heretofore it hath ben) to the Kings most Excellent Majestie, that it vvould please him (now after our long exile, and other manifold afflictions) to vouchsafe us that gracious sufferance, that we may be permitted to liue in peace, under his Majesties government, in our ovvne natiue countrey: there to obserue all the ordinances of Christ giuen to his Church, vvithout being urged to the use or approbation of any remnants of the apostasie of Antichrist, or other humane traditions whatsoever: vve carying our selues in all loyaltie, peace, and godlines, as becometh all faithfull subjects in the Lord. Whom vve dayly pray, to sta∣blish his Highnes throne in peace vvith much blessing, as he did to the good kings of Iudah, vvho (rejecting the inventions and commixtures of Man in the faith and vvorship of God) vvere careful to admit of no re∣ligion, nor any other thing in religion, but that onely vvhich was warran∣ted by the word of God: that so his Majestie may alvvay find, as they did, and as Salomon that vvise king observed, and hath left recorded, thatProv. 20, 28. mercy and truth preserue the king; and that his throne is upholden with mercy: andProv. 29, 14. A king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shalbe established for ever. Which mercie the Lord God, who is King of Kings, vouchsafe unto his Majestie, and his Royall seed, with all increase of glory, peace, and happines, in this life, and for ever. Amen. Ier. 6, 16. Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the waies and see, and aske for the old paths, where is the good vvay, and walk therein: and ye shall find rest for your soules. Sal. Song. 1, 7, 8. The church speaketh, and asketh of Christ: Tell me (O thou whom my soule loveth) where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noone: for why should I beOr, as one that is vayled. as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? Christ answereth: If thou knowest not (O thou fairest among women) goe thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kiddes beside the Shepheards tents. Rom. 15.4. Whatsoever things were written aforetime, they were afore-written for our learning, that we through pacience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope.
THE SECOND TREATISE. Of some things concerning them that are called Remonstrants. Hitherto of these opinions of the Anabaptists, and the assertions of others withall thereabout. Now I come to some other points, which concerne not onely the Anabaptists, but such other Christians also, as are called Remonstrants or Arminians. CHAPTER I. Touching Gods decree of Election. WHether God hath not in Christ, before the foundation of the world, according to the good pleasure of his wil, fore∣ordeyned some to eternall life; to be accomplished through Christ the Mediatour, to the praise of the glorie of his grace. Ephes. 1, 3 — 14. Act. 13, 48. Matth. 25, 34. 2 Tim. 1, 9. 1 Pet. 1, 2 — 5, 19, 20. Revel. 13, 8. and 21, 27. 1 Thes. 5, 9. Amos 9, 9, 11, 12. Mal. 1, 2. compared with Rom. 8, 28, 29, 30. and 9, 11, 12, 13, 23. Where (for the speciall point now in controversie) let us consider, whe∣ther the originall fountaine and onely cause moving God in himself here∣unto, be not the good pleasure of his will: & not the vvill of man; neyther our faith, or vvorks foreseen; nor any other thing from without God himself vvhatsoever. 1. Because the Scripture thus teacheth, in these places and the like: Ephes. 1, 5, 9, 11. Exod. 33, 19. vvith Rom. 9, 11, 15, 16, 21, 23. Matt. 11, 26. & 20, 15. Jam. 1, 18. 2 Tim. 1, 9. Luk. 12, 32. compared with 1 Sam. 12, 22. Rom. 11, 1, 2, 5, 6, 33, 34, 35, 36. 2. And otherwise, Gods election should rely and be grounded partly on man, and not onely on God himself, that he may be all in all. And so Gods decree of election frō everlasting should not be onely of his owne free grace, but partly of our selues; or by reason of our faith, works, or vvorthynes foreseen: Contrarie to the Scriptures aforesaid. 3. Then also part of the glorie of our salvation should be ascribed to man, & not the whole to God alone. Neyther should we haue such cause of being humbled in our selues; and of renouncing all confidence in any vvorthynes of our ovvne; that so vve may in deed giue all glorie to God,
as novv vve haue. Ephes. 1, 3 — 6. Rom. 9, 11, 16, 23, 36. 1 Cor. 3, 26 — 31. & 4, 7. with Ier. 9, 23, 24. Joh. 16, 14. 4. Othervvise also our election should not be altogether certaine and unchangeable, as novv it is, inasmuch as it is grounded onely upon God, vvith vvhom is no chaunge or shadow of turning: and not upon man, vvho is subject to chaunge and alteration. Rom. 9, 11. and 11, 2, 5, 29. with Hos. 13, 14. Ioh. 10, 16 — 29. 1 Pet. 1, 2 — 5. 2 Tim. 1, 12. and 2, 19. Rom. 8, 29, 30, 33, 38, 39. Mal. 3, 6. Iam. 1, 17. Numb. 23, 19. 1 Sam. 15, 29. Psal. 102, 13, 14, 27, 28. Exod. 3, 14. Esa. 46, 10. Which is the more to be observed, because they themselues also write, that the Saincts and faithfull may fall avvay wholy from the grace of God, and perish for ever. So as their owne opinions being layd together, they seem to deale in this matter, much like as the Anabaptists doe in the other aforesaid: Who vvhen the Lord himself hath giuen us a sure ground for the ministration of Baptisme to the faith∣full and their children, to wit, Gods gracious covenant and commande∣ment: they (to exclude children from the participation thereof) vvould bring us to an uncertain ground, of Mans profession of faith and repen∣tance.Hos. 6, 4. Matth. 13, 20. Act. 8 13, 23. 2 Tim. 4, 10. For although there may be good use made of such profession a∣bout other questions touching Baptisme, and the ministration therof: yet vvhen we inquire of the right and sure ground hereof, we must carefully keep unto that which God hath laid himself, for the administring of his ovvne signe and seale of his covenant of grace, and not admit of any un∣certain one relying upon man. And (to note it by the vvay) it is a good thing in religion (concerning the points and questions thereof) both for instruction and comfort unto us, still to look unto the grounds thereof, and to obserue vvhether they be sure and certain, as relying on God, or doubtfull and uncertain, as proceeding from man. 5. Neither els should our faith and holines depend upon Gods electi∣on of grace; but his election should depend upon our faith and holynes. Which is contrary to the Scriptures: as may be seen, both touching faith, Act. 13, 38. and 22, 14. Jam. 2, 5. with Tit. 1, 1. and touching good works and holynes of life, Ephes. 1, 4. and 2, 10. 2 Thes. 2, 13, 14. 2 Tim. 1, 9. Where the Scripture shevveth,See the truth here∣of also, in another case, touch∣ing Gods dealing with Ze∣rubbabel; Hag. 2, 23. that our faith & holynes follovv after Gods election, as fruits thereof: and goe not before it, as causes thereof. Also, that they are meanes and vvaies by which God wil bring us to salvation in Christ; but not the fountain and cause of our election, to the Lord himself. By which may also appear, that the doctrine of predestination doth not any vvay hinder faith or good vvorks (as is objected:) but in deed stirreth up & incourageth thereunto: inasmuch as although unto God they are not the cause of our election, yet to our selues they are a good assurance thereof, seeing they are fruits proceeding thereof: and are also meanes vvhich it pleaseth God to use, and the way vvherein he would haue us to vvalk, to salvation in Christ, and the glorie of his Name, for ever. Where∣of therefore vve should be so much the more carefull, as we are desirous to glorifie God, and to haue our calling and election to life eternall, assu∣red
unto our selues. 2 Pet. 1, 1 — 10. Rom. 8, 28, 29, 30. Mat. 5, 16. & 25, 34, 35, &c. 6. Moreover hovv els is it true, that babes & litle children are heires of the blessing of God, and perteyn to the kingdome of heauen: & therefore also to Gods eternall election of grace? Mar. 10, 13 — 16. Luk. 18, 15, 16. Rom. 5, 14, 15. and 8, 33. and 9, 11. and 11, 1 — 7. Matt. 18, 2, 10. and 19, 13, 14, 15. with Heb. 1, 14. For upon the other opinions vvould follovv, eyther that God hath elected no infants to salvation, but that they are all rejected and re∣probate: or that infants (aswell as elder people) haue that repentance, faith, and perseverance in godlines: which is required by the Opposites to be in all that are chosen by God unto life eternall. Whereas many of them dye in their infancie, & some the first moneth, or first day they are borne: and yet are partakers of Gods grace, and inheritors of his king∣dome in Christ: as is aforesaid. 7. Finally, there are also elect Angels, asvvell as elect men: & the like cause in God of his election of both: to vvit, the good pleasure of his wil. Els should not the vvil of God be the ground and rule of al righteousnes; nor God himself be al in all, Christ being the head of all principalitie and power, as the Scripture sheweth. 1 Tim. 5, 21. compared with Ephes. 1, 11. Col. 1, 16 — 19. and 2, 10. Iob. 38, 7. Revel. 5, 11, 12, 13. Ephes. 3, 10. Exod. 33, 19. Psal. 115, 1, 3. Revel. 19, 10. with 1, 1. Heb. 1, 14. and 12, 22. Matt. 22, 30. Luk. 20, 35, 36. Rom. 11, 36. Seeing therefore the Scripture teacheth, that the election of God, is according to the good pleasure of his own will: seeing also it is grounded on God and not on Man; being certain and unchangeable; of the free grace and gift of God; to the glorie and praise of his grace; causing and going be∣fore our faith and holines of life; making Infants partakers of the king∣dome of heauen; and having the like cause, as is of the choise of the elect Angels: let us therefore vvith the Scriptures, and according thereunto, acknowledge that the fountaine and originall cause of our election, is onely the will and good pleasure of God, to the praise of his Name and glorie of his grace, for ever. Hereunto also agree some sayings of the auncient Writers. As vvhen Augustine saith, Christ chose us, not because we beleeue, but that we might beleeue: least we should be said, first to haue chosen him; and that should be false which he said, You haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you. August. de predest. sanctorum. lib. 1,Ioh. 15, 16 cap. 17, & 19. And again, I see that the Father also loved us before, not onely before Christ dyed for us, but before he made the world: the Apostle himself being witnes, who saith,Ephes. 1, 4. As he hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world. August. de Trinitat. l. 13, cap. 11. Fulgentius also testifieth that there is not in the Saints any cause of Gods Pre∣destination, but onely the good will of God. Fulgent. ad Marinum lib. 1. And thus much of the Decree of Gods election.
CHAPTER II. Touching Gods Decree of Reprobation. VVHether God hath not of old, according to his owne vvill, good pleasure, and purpose, passed by some in his election of grace, & appointed them to wrath & condemnation, to be accomplished through their ovvne desert, for the declaration of his glorie. Jude, ver. 4, and 6. Rom. 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18. with Exod. 9, 16. Mal. 1, 3. Matt. 11, 25.26. and 25, 41. 2 Pet. 2.4, 12. 1 Pet. 2, 8. Ioh. 3, 18, 19, 36. and 10, 26. 2 Cor. 4, 3, 4. Prov. 16, 4. Rom. 2, 5. and 9, 19 — 22. and 11, 33 — 36. Where againe let us consider, vvhether the very cause moving God hereunto, be not his ovvne vvill, good pleasure, and purpose in himself: and not the will, or abuse of free will in the creatures, neither unbelief, or other sinnes of any foreseen. 1. Because the Scripture thus teacheth in these and the like places: Rom. 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. and 11, 33 — 36. compared vvith Gen. 25, 23. Mal. 1, 3. Exod. 9, 16. Matth. 11, 25, 26. and 20, 15. 2. And otherwise, the moving cause hereof should not be in God him∣self, but from vvithout him. Contrarie to the Scriptures aforesaid, & to the infinite, eternall, and unchangeable nature of God. 3. Neyther els should there be in generall, one and the same cause of Gods decree, for election, & for reprobation: and that also both of An∣gels, and of men: as there is one Decreer of both, from all eternitie, to the glorie of his Name for ever. Rom. 9, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22, 23. 1 Thes. 5, 9. Mat. 11, 25, 26. and 20, 15. and 25, 41. 2 Pet. 2, 4, 12. Prov. 16, 4. Rom. 11, 33 — 36. 4. Els also vve doe not in very deed acknovvledge the vvill of God to be the ground and rule of all righteousnes, in this, as in all other of his actions: how ever they seem strange unto flesh and blood, which can not comprehend them. Rom. 9, 18. Psal. 115, 3. Esa. 14, 24 — 27. and 28, 29. and 46, 9, 10, 11. Ezech. 1, 4, &c. Psal. 92, 5. Matth. 11.25.26. and 20, 15. 5. Moreover, If sinne foreseen, be the cause of Reprobation, then it is eyther originall, or actuall sinne. But not originall sinne, because then all men being so borne, should be reprobate. Neyther actuall sinne: first, because then no infants, no not of the Turks or Heathens, that dye in their infancie, should be reprobate: secondly, because that then on the other hand, all of yeres should be reprobate and rejected, seeing all such sinne actually: as the Scripture teacheth, and al vvil acknovvledge. 1 King. 8, 46. Psal. 14, 2, 3. Rom. 3, 9 — 19. Eccles. 7, 20. 6. Besides, if unbelief or other sinne foreseene should be the cause of Reprobation, then should also faith and holines foreseen be the cause of Gods election. But this is not so: as vvas shevved here before: p. 221, &c. 7. Finally, vvhy els should the Apostle so sharply rebuke, such as make vaine and odious objections hereabout, as he doth, vvhen he saith, O man, vvho art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter povver over the day, of the same
lumpe, to make one vessell unto honour, and another unto dishonour? What if God vvil∣ling to shevv his vvrath, & to make his povver knovven, indured vvith long suffring the vessels of vvrath, fitted to destruction? and that he might make knovven the riches of his glorie on the vessels of mercy, which he hath afore prepared unto glorie? Rom. 9, 20— 23. And hovv greatly again doth the same Apostle admire and reve∣rendly adore Gods dealing herein (teaching us by his example so to doe, as he doth) saying: O the depth of the riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of God? how unsearchable are his judgements, and his waies past traceing out? For who hath knowen the mynd of the Lord, or who hath ben his counsellour? Or who hath first giuen to him, & it shalbe recompensed unto him again? For of him, & through him, and to him are all things: to vvhom be glorie for ever. Amen. Rom. 11, 33 — 36. SOME OBJECTIONS AND ANSWERS. Object. I. But this opinion and doctrine maketh God to be the first cause and author of all sinne. Ansvv. Not so: For first, the elect also sinne, and not the Reprobate onely. And Gods decree of reprobation perteyneth onely to the Repro∣bate, and not to the elect. Another cause therefore there is, and must needs be of sinne, both in the elect and reprobate: namely, the abuse of free vvill in Adam, in vvhom all haue sinned, and of whom all are descen∣ded, both the elect and reprobate: and synce Adams fall, mans naturall corruption, & his corrupt vvill & concupiscence. Gen. 3, 1 — 6. and 5, 3. com∣pared vvith Rom. 5, 12 — 19. Jam. 1, 13 — 17. Eccles. 7, 29. Ephes. 2, 3. 2. Secondly, vve are to distinguish between the action, and the corru∣ption, of sinne: Also, betvveen sinne, and the punishment of sinne. Sinne (as sinne) and the corruption thereof, is of man, who being made righ∣teous, transgressed vvittingly & willingly. (For vvhich see the Scriptures afore∣said, and the like.) But as it is an action, the abilitie to doe this or that is of God, in vvhom we liue, and moue, and haue our being. Act. 17, 21. also as it is the punishment of sinne, it is justly inflicted by the Lord, vvho is just to punish sinne. Thus God hardneth the heart of Pharaoh, Exod. 4, 21. & 9, 12, 16. vvith Rom. 9, 17, 18. and Pharaoh hardneth it himself, Exo. 8, 15, 32. and 9, 34. Which, as Pharaoh doth it, is sinne: as God doth it, it is the pu∣nishment of sinne. And thus it hath the consideration of good, for decla∣ration of the justice of God. For God is just in all his waies, and holy in all his vvorks. Psal. 145, 17. and his understanding is infinite, vvhich man may admire, but cānot cōprehend. Psa. 147, 5. & 77, 19. vvith Rom. 11, 13-36. 3. Thirdly, distinguish also betvveen effects, and consequents. Sinnes come after Gods decree of Reprobation, not as effects therof, but as cō∣sequents that follovv after it. It is most holy, & so not the cause of sinne. 4. Neither is it sound to say, because God suffereth this or that, there∣fore he doeth it. Difference is to be put between Gods decree of permis∣sion, vvhich concerneth all; and between Gods decree of Reprobation, vvhich respecteth onely some, to wit, the Reprobate. Besides, all know, that men suffer many things, which they doe not, nor can be said to doe,
nay vvhich many times they forbid. And the cause of an action (rightly and properly considered) is in the doer, not in the sufferer. 5. Otherwise, let it be observed, whether these men themselues doe not in deed by their opinions make God the author of sinne, and of evill and destruction: vvho hold, that God would haue all and every particular man vvhosoever to be saved; and cannot deny, but he is able to saue all vvhom he is vvilling to saue; and yet also grant (as the truth is) that he doth not saue all. What now vvil follow hereupon, according to their as∣sertions, let them consider with themselues. 6. Finally, God is so farre from being author of sinne (as it is sinne) as he hateth, forbiddeth, and condemneth it: vvhich his word everie where, and his vvorks at all times make manifest. Object. II. But the Lord saith by Ezekiell, I will not the death of the wic∣ked, but that the wicked turne from his way and liue. Ezec. 18, 23, 32. and 33, 11. Ansvv. 1. The Lord is not contrarie to himself, who saith by the same Prophet, As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I haue giuen to the fire for fewell: so vvill I giue the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and I vvill set my face against them: they shall goe out from one fire, and another fire shall devoure them: and you shall knovve that I am the Lord, vvhen I set my face against them. Ezec. 15, 6, 7. Where the Prophet shevveth, that as the vine tree is by Gods framing and dis∣position of it, giuen to be fevvell for the fyer: so also the Ievves & inha∣bitants of Ierusalem vvere then by the speciall decree of God appointed to the fire and destruction. 2. The Prophet speaketh of temporarie death, as may appeare by Ezech. 33, 11, 25, 28. and 18, 2, 13, 27. compared vvith chapt. 12, and 13, and 14, and 15, &c. vvhereas the question is about reprobation to eternall death. And great difference there is, betvveen these tvvo: as may be seen in the ca∣ses of Naboth and the Blasphemer (spoken of, Lev. 24.) who vvere both of them stoned to death. Lev. 24, 14 — 21. and 1 King. 21, 1 — 13. Also in Io∣siah and Achab, who vvere both slaine in battell. 1 King. 22, 34, 35. and 2 Chron. 35, 20— 24. These now had a like bodily & violent death: but shal vve therefore match them together as like, touching eternall death? 3. Difference also is to be put betvveene the revealed, and the hidden vvill of God, so to call it. As may be observed in the Lords dealing with Abraham, Ezechiah, and others. God biddeth Abraham take Isaac his sonne, & sacrifice him: yet Gods purpose vvas but thus to trie Abrahams faith and obedience: vvhich purpose of God was as yet concealed from Abraham, till God did afterward manifest it. Gen. 22, 1, 2. &c. The Lord also biddeth Esaiah goe tell Hezekiah, that he should then dye: when God notwithstanding doeth afterward adde fifteene yeres more to his life: which as yet was concealed from Hezekiah. Esa. 38, 1. &c. Yet this double will (so to call it) is but in respect of us, and the manifestation thereof unto us. For otherwise in respect of God himself, he never would any other thing, but that vvhich also he doth. 4. Again, difference is to be put between willing as delighting with, & wil∣ling
as decreing. Otherwise if God simply would not, none should dy at al. 5. Obserue vvithal, vvhether in the places aforesaid the Prophet speak not of the vvicked converting to the Lord; and not of the Reprobate (whereabout the question novv is:) For which, consider that vvhich is vvritten in Ezech. 18, 21, 22, 27, 28, &c. 6. Finally, the right translation & understanding here is thus:Or, I am not deligh∣ted with. I haue no pleasure (saith the Lord) in the death of the wicked, &c. Whereupon obserue againe, that God delighteth not in the death of a sinner (in one re∣spect) as it is the destruction of his creature, Ezech. 18, 23. and 33, 11. But he delighteth in it (in another respect) as it is his just punishment of sinne. Psal. 37, 13. vvith 2, 4, 5, 12. Prov. 1, 26. Ezech. 21, 17. And here see Piscat. in Ezech. 18, 23, 32. and 33, 11. Also Piscat. Resp. ad duas disputat. Taufreri, & Resenij, pag. 38, & 100. Object. III. But the doctrine of Gods predestination, especially of Reprobation, should not be taught, or at least not be taught unto the common people, &c. Ansvv. 1. Why then doeth the Scripture teach it: the Prophets, Apo∣stles, and Christ himself? The Prophets, Gen. 25, 23. vvith Rom. 9, 12. Exod. 9, 16. and 33, 19. vvith Rom. 9, 15, 17, 18. Ier. 6, 30. Mal. 1, 2, 3. vvith Rom. 9, 13. Prov. 16, 4. vvhere it is expressely said, that the Lord hath made all things for himself; yea, euen the vvicked for the day of evill. And Christ himself also teacheth the same, when he saith,or, I con∣fesse to thee I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heauen and earth, because thou hast hid these things (the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen) from the vvise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Euen so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. Mat. 11, 25, 26. Where it is evident, that Gods decree, not onely of election, but of reprobation also, dependeth meerely on Gods good will and pleasure. Also, Matt. 13, 11. And again, when he saith in his prayer to the Father, Those that thou hast giuen me, I haue kept, and none of them is lost, but the sonne of perdition: meaning Iudas. John 17, 12. Like as Antichrist also is called, the sonne of perdition, 2 Thes. 2, 3. that is, appointed to perdition and condemnation: As by the sonnes of death, is understood also such, as are appointed to dye. Psal. 79, 11. and 102. 20. And the Apostles teach it in like sort: namely, the Apostle Paul, Rom. 9, 11 — 23. and 11 chap. 2 Tim. 2, 19, 20. Ephes. 1, 3 — 11. 1 Thes. 5, 9. where the Apostle having said, Let us not sleep, as doe others: but let us that are of the day, be sober, putting on the brestplate of faith and loue, and for an helmet, the hope of salvation: then presently annexeth: For God hath not appointed us to vvrath: but to obteyne salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. And Peter likewise, who teacheth out of the Prophets, that Christ is a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, to them vvhich stumble at the word, being diso∣bedient, vvhereunto also they vvere appointed. 1 Per. 2, 8. And Iude the Apostle, saying, There are certain men crept in unavvares, vvho vvere of old foreordeyned to this condemnation, &c. Jude ver. 4. Thus doe the Prophets, Apostles, & Christ himself, plainly and purposely teach this doctrine. And should not then the ministers of Christ tread in their steppes, being still carefull to teach it wisely, and soundly according to the Scriptures? For vvhatsoever things
are vvritten aforetime, they vvere vvritten for our learning, that we through pacience, and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope. Rom. 15, 4. 2. Moreover, this doctrine is both lawful, and good to be taught in the church: 1. Because it glorifyeth God, ascribing and yeelding to God, the glorie of his mercie, justice, wisdome, and povver over all. Ioh. 16, 14. Rom. 9, 22, 23. and 11, 33 — 36. II. Because it stirreth up to holynes of life, prayer, thanksgiving, good vvorks, searching and relying on the word of God, &c. 1 Thes. 5, 6 — 9. Mat. 11, 25, 26. Act. 4, 24 — 28. &c. Ephes. 1, 3, 12. and 2, 10. Rom. 15, 4. 2 Tim. 3, 15, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 1, 3 — 10. III. Because it assureth us of the certaintie of our salvation, being grounded in the eternall and unchangeable counsell of God: It teacheth us to cast off all confidence in our selues, and to ascribe our salvation onely to the grace of God, ac∣knowledging and admiring the riches of Gods mercy, vvho of his free grace hath chosen us to life and salvation in Christ: It comforteth us a∣gainst distrust, despaire, and other manifold tentations, arising by meanes of troubles and adversities that befall us in this life, teaching us in all things paciently to rest in the work of God: and particularly, it streng∣theneth us against the grief and offence, that otherwise we might take at the iniquitie and evill dealing of hypocrites and other wicked persons, in the church, or out of the church: in asmuch as we knovv, that God is the disposer of all things, & that they come to passe according to his eternall and most certain and determinate counsell, vvho therefore will vvork all things for good unto us in Christ. 2 Tim. 2, 19, 20. Rom. 8, 28 — 39. and 11, 33 — 36. 2 Sam. 16, 10, 11. and Iob 1, 21. Mat. 11, 25, 26. and 20, 15. John 17, 12. Act, 2, 23. and 4, 27, 28. 1 Pet. 2, 6, 7, 8. Jude ver. 3, and 4. Rev. 13, 8. and 17 8. & 20, 15. and 21, 27. 3. It giueth us good & necessarie occasion, to put difference between Gods decree of election & reprobation, which was before all beginning, and betvveen the execution thereof, vvhich succedeth in time aftervvard. And thereupon to obserue, that many things come betvveen the decree it self, and the execution thereof: which are due meanes & causes of the latter, that are not at all any causes of the former. Rom. 8, 29, 30. 1 Pet, 1, 2, 18, 19, 20. and 2, 6 — 10. Mat. 11, 25, 26. Act. 13, 48. and 14, 16. Psal. 81, 12. Esa 29, 10. Rom. 11, 2, 5 — 10.33 — 36. Some testimonies of auncient Writers. Iustine Martyr saith, God is not in the cause, that such as are predestinate are un∣just, vvhether Angels or men, but everie one by his owne fault is such a one, as he shall appeare. Iustin. Martyr. in Dialogo cum Tryphone Iudaeo. Augustine saith, They seek to know the causes of the will of God: when as the will of God, is it self the cause of al things that are. For if the wil of God haue a cause, then there is some thing that goeth before the will of God: which is wicked to beleeue. August. tom. 1. lib. 1. de Genes. contra Manichaeos, cap. 2.
And moreover, In them that were not yet borne, and as yet had not done any thing, there could not be any regard of deserts: &c. But if it be said, that their conver∣sation to come made the difference in the judgment of God, then surely that shalbe made of no effect, vvhich the Apostle spake before, saying: Not of works.Rom. 9, 11. But seeing he saith generally, Not of works: there he vvould also haue vvorks past, and to come, to be un∣derstood: to wit, works past, which were none at all, and works to come, which vvere not as yet. Ibid. tom. 7. lib. de Predest. & Gratia. cap. 7. And again, Hovv then said he unto these, you are not of my sheep?Ioh. 10, 26. Because he savv, that they vvere predestinate to eternall destruction, not prepared to life eternall by the ransome of his blood. Ibid. tom. 9. tractat. in Iohannem, 48. Isidorus also saith, There is a double or tvvo fold Predestination: eyther of the elect unto rest, or of the reprobate unto death. Isidor. de summo bono, lib. 2, cap. 6. And Fulgentius saith, The vvicked are predestinate unto the second death of the soule, that is, to the lake of fyer and brimstone. Fulgent. ad Monimum, lib. 1. cap. 27. And hitherto concerning Gods decree of Election & Reprobation. CHAPTER III. Touching generall Redemption. VVHether Christ haue not by his death, (according to the counfess and decree of God) redeemed onely the elect from their sinnes, and from the vvrath of God due thereunto: and not all, and every one in the vvorld (none excepted) therefrom. Esa. 53 ch. compared with Rom. 8, 33, 34. 1 Thes. 1, 10. Psal. 16, 2, 3, 4. &c. vvith Act. 2, 25 — 36. Matt. 1, 21. and 26, 28. vvith Dan. 9, 24 — 27. 1 Cor. 5, 7. vvith Exod. 12, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14. Joh. 10, 15. Ephes. 1, 4 — 14. and 5.23.25. Tit. 2, 13, 14. Heb. 2, 10, 17. and 9, 22, 24, 28. and 13, 20. 1 Pet. 1, 2, 3, 4, 18 — 21. Revel. 21, 27. 1. Because they that are redeemed from their sinnes by the death of Christ, are also delivered from the wrath to come; and in Christ are ju∣stified, quickned, and begotten again to a living hope by his resurrection from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, being reserved in heauen for us. 1 Thes. 1.10. Rom. 8.33.34. and 4.25. vvith Esa. 53 chap. and Ephes. 2.5.6. 1 Pet. 1.2.3.4. Which grace is peculiar onely to the elect, and not to all in the vvorld whosoever. As ap∣peareth by the Scriptures here noted before in the generall Position, and many other the like in the vvord of God. 2. The Prophets teach us, that the righteousnes which novv Christ hath brought in, is an everlasting righteousnes: vvhereas that vvhich Adam had at the first, was quickly lost and foone gone. Dan. 9.24. vvith Eccles. 7.29. Psal. 49.12.20. And the Apostles teach us, that the Redemption which Christ hath obteyned for us by his death, is an eternall Redemption. Eternall (I say) not onely in respect of the typicall or temporall Redemption and reconciliation made by the Priests in Israell; but also in regard of the fruit and benefit, vvhereof the redeemed are in deed made partakers to eternall righteousnes and salvation, by Iesus Christ. Heb. 9.12. vvith ver. 24,
28. and Dan. 9.24 — 27. Rom. 8.23.29.30. Luk. 21, 28. Psal. 16.3 — 11 and 130.7.8. Ezec. 43.18 — 27. vvith Hebr. 1.3.14. and 2.5 — 9.10.11▪17.18. and 4.14.15.16. and 5.9.10. and 6.17 — 20. and 10.14. and 13.10.11.12.20.21. Ephes. 1.4.7.14. 1 Pet. 5.10, 1 Cor. 1.30.31. Where yet further to this end may be consider∣ed, how the Scripture speaking of our Redemption, doth by this word some∣times meane the price and raunsome which Christ hath payed & answe∣red for us unto God; sometimes our full enjoyning of the fruit & effect thereof in eternall glorie. Ephes. 1, 7.14. 1 Cor. 1, 30. 1 Pet. 1, 18, 19. vvith Luk. 21, 28. Rom. 8.23. Like as the word Regeneration may sometimes be under∣stood of our nevv birth that is begun in this life; sometimes of our whole and full renevving to the enjoying of eternall glorie in the life to come, Tit. 3, 5. and Iohn 3, 3. 1 Pet. 1, 3, 4. vvith Mat. 19, 28. and Act. 3, 21. 2 Pet. 3, 13. Wherein we may also obserue, how they which are partakers of the one, shal likevvise be partakers of the other. As vvhom the Lord once loveth, and accepteth in his beloved Sonne Iesus Christ, them he loveth to the end. Rom. 8, 37, 38, 39. and 9, 11, 13. vvith Mal. 1, 2. Ephes. 1, 5, 6. and 5, 2, 25 — 27. Ier. 31, 3. and Iohn 13, 1. and 15, 13. vvith 10, 15, 16, 17, 27, 28. So as then, if all and every one in the vvorld (without exception of any) be redeemed by the death of Christ, it vvould follow that all should be saved, having an eternall righteousnes and redemption, and being made partakers of the loue of God, and regeneration, to eternall life. And so the Reprobate should be redeemed and saved, asvvell as the elect, and the unrepentant, unbelevers, & most vvicked in the world, should be partakers of eternall redemption, righteousnes and salvation by Christ, asvvell as the repen∣tant, and the beleevers, and most godly that ever vvere. Which is against the vvhole course of the Scriptures throughout. 3. Besides that such generall redemption cannot stand, vvith that un∣cessant and unreconciliable enmity, which God himself, upon the fall of man, did put between the seed of the serpent, & the seed of the vvoman. Gen. 3, 15. By the seed of the serpent, I understand (withPiscat. in Gen. 3, 15. &c. others) the wicked & reprobate, who are of their father the divell: as Christ shevveth, Iohn 8, 44. and by the seed of the vvoman, Christ himself specially, and in Christ al the faith∣full & elect, that come of that our first mother Eva, there spoken off. 1 Joh. 3, 7, 8, 9. Heb. 2, 11.14, 15. Rom. 16, 20. Gal. 4, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 15, 54 — 57. Novv if synce the fall, Christ hath redemed all in the vvorld, whosoever, euen the wicked and reprobate, then hath there ben a reconciliation made again betweene the parties aforesaid; and that enmitie between them taken avvay: (for Christ is the Lambe, slaine from the foundation of the world, Rev. 13, 8. Hebr. 13, 8.) And so the counsell and vvork of God should be infringed, touching that hostile and perpetuall enmitie, vvhich the Lord himself said, he vvould put between the seed of the serpent, and the seed of the vvoman, as is aforesaid. But this cannot stand, with the unchange∣ablenes of Gods counsell, or truth of his word. And therefore is errone∣ous. Not to speak of that confirmation thereof, which the continual ex∣perience of all ages, and euen of this generation, wherein we liue at this
day, may afford. 4. And if vve look at Israel, we may obserue, that in the Tabernacle & Temple there were tvvo Altars: the one called the brasen Altar, for the burnt offering and sacrifice; the other the golden Altar, for the burning of incense thereupon. At both vvhich, the Priests (as types of Iesus Christ) ministred in Israell. The one more specially typing out the Redemption vvrought by Christ, the other his Intercession. Exod. 27, 1 — 8. and 30, 1 — 8. Ezech. 40, 47. and 41, 22. and 43, 13 — 27. compared vvith Heb. 13, 10, 11, 12. Revel. 8, 3, 4. By which, as we may learne against the Papists, that Iesus Christ is our Redeemer at the brasen altar (on vvhom alone vve are to relie for sal∣vation;) and our Intercessour at the golden altar (on vvhom alone also vve are to relye for the mediation of his Intercession for us, and not upon the Angels or Saints departed:) so likewise for the question in hand, we may furthermore learne this withall, that Iesus Christ is Redeemer onely for them, for whom he is Intercessour. And Intercessour he is onely for the Elect and faithfull; and not for the world, the Reprobate and wicked therein. As Christ himself, and the Prophets and Apostles doe teach us. Ioh. 17, 9, 20, 24. Psal. 16, 3, 4. with Act. 2, 25 — 36. Esa. 53, 12. Rom. 8, 33, 34. Heb. 9, 24. Rev. 8, 3, 4. Therefore also he is the Redeemer onely of the elect, and not of the world, the wicked and reprobate vvhosoever. Which is yet further con∣firmed unto us, by the very names and titles, vvhich in the Scriptures are attributed to Christ agreably hereunto: as namely, that he is called Jesus, Christ, the Saviour, the Annoynted one; the Author, Captaine, and finisher of our faith and salvation; the great shepheard of the sheep; the shepheard and Bishop of our soules; the Father of eternitie; the Prince of peace; the Angell of the covenant; the Sun of righteousnes; the comfort of Israell; and eternall life, &c.

Hither also may be referred, that as the Passeover of old vvas insti∣tuted and killed for Israell onely, and not for the Egyptians: so Christ our Passeover was ordeyned and sacrificed onely for his Israel & chosen people, and not for the vvicked and all in the world vvhosoever, none excepted. Exod. 12. chap. 2 Chron. 30. and 35. Ezr. 6, 19 — 22. compared with 1 Cor. 5,7. and Rom. 8, 33, 34. 1 Pet. 1, 2, 18,— 21. 1 Joh. 5, 19, 20. 6. Christ by his death hath redemed those onely, for vvhom the Lords pleasure prospereth in his hand: whom also he maketh to be his seed, & him to be the chastisement of their peace, to be healed vvith his stripes. Esa. 53, 5, 10. with 1 Pet. 2, 24, 25. Which fruit and effect is onely in the elect, and not in all whosoever: as all will confesse. Otherwise also we should extend the redemption of Christ, further then God himself (vvho gaue him to death for us) intended it: and contrarie to the Scriptures, which apply it onely to some, and not to all and everie one in the world whoso∣ver. Psa. 16, 2, 3, 4. &c. with Act. 2, 25 — 36. Esa 9, 6, 7. & 53, 4 — 67. Ier. 23, 5, 6. Dan, 9 24 — 27. Ioel 2, 33. Mic. 5, 2. Mal. 4, 2. Mat. 1, 21. & 20, 28. & 26, 28. Luk. 19, 9, 10. Rom. 8, 33, 34.

7. Christ layd dovvne his life onely for his sheep. Joh. 10, 11, 15, 16. and 15, 19. Heb. 13, 20. 1 Pet. 2, 24, 25. And therefore not for al in the world, see∣ing all are not his sheep. Joh. 10, 26. Mat. 25, 33. &c. 8. Christ dyed to confirme the covenant of Gods grace, for eternall salvation unto his people. Dan. 9, 24 — 27. Gal. 3, 13 — 18. Heb. 9, 15, 16. and 13, 20, 21. Mal. 3, 1. and 4, 2. with Mat. 1, 21. and 26, 27, 28. And therefore onely for them that are the heires of salvation. For vvhich, see the Scriptures & reasons aforesaid. Now whereas Daniell speaking of the Messiah, saith he should be cut off, and bring in everlasting righteousnes, and confirme the covenant with Many,Piscat. resp. ad disp. Taufren p. 73. &c. &c. Dan. 9, 24 — 27. two things there are, about the vvord (Many) well observed by some vvriters: which here I vvill mention. One is, that if we doe thus translate and understand the vvord Many, then we must re∣member, that the elect & godly (for the number of them) are to be con∣sidered two vvaies: either in comparison with others; or simply in them∣selues. The elect and godly, in comparison of the reprobate and ungod∣ly, are few, and the lesser number. Mat. 7, 13, 14. and 20, 16. and 22, 14. Rom. 9, 27,Piscat. in Dan. 9, 27. 28, 29. with Esa. 1, 9. and 10, 22, 23. But being considered in themselues, the elect and faithful are many, and the number of them very great Mat. 20, 28. Heb. 9, 28. with Esa. 53, 11, 12. Rev. 7, 4 — 9. The other thing is, that the word here translated (Many) may also be translated the excellent, the great, the noble, glorious, honourable, &c. as the same vvord is by Daniell (in the sin∣gular number) used & applied to God, vvhen he calleth him the great God, Dan. 2, 45. and by others also is used, when they speak of men, or other things, that are great or excellent: as in Iob. 32, 9. Ier. 41, 12. Hos. 8, 12. and so likevvise may be understood, in Esa, 53, 11. And thus it agreeth vvith Davids speach (Psa. 16.) where (using another word) he bringeth in Christ speaking to God the Father, thus: My goodnes extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints vvhich are on earth, & to the excellent; in vvhom is all my delight, Psal. 16, 2, 3, &c. By vvhich Psalme also we may learne (for the question in hand) that the benefit of Christs redemption and mediation, is not to be exten∣ded to Idolaters, unbelevers, or other like wicked persons (vers. 4.) but onely to those in whom Christ delighteth, that is, to the Saints, that are great, excellent and noble, being made the sonnes of God in Christ (ver. 3. vvith 1 Ioh. 3, 1. & Joh. 1, 12.) For whom Christ dyed, and rose again from the dead, & is set in glorie at the right hand of God, vvhere are pleasures for evermore. Psal. 16. And that thus we may understand and apply this Psalme unto Christ, and to the work of his redemption and mediation, vve may learne by the Apostles themselues, so alledging & applying it, & other psalmes accordingly. Act. 2, 25 — 36. compared with Psal. 16, 8 — 11. and 110, 1. & 132, 11. 9. They whom Christ hath redeemed by his death, haue remission of sinnes through the blood of his crosse; receiue the spirit of adoption of sonnes; are sanctified, renewed, and made conformable to the image of Christ; are never separated from the loue of God, vvhich is in Christ Ie∣sus; become members of that body vvhereof Christ is the head and Sa∣viour; are the Saints of the High ones, or of the high places; and haue the
Angels sent forth to minister for them, as being the heires of salvation. Ephes. 1, 7. Col. 1, 12 — 14. Rom. 8, 15 — 39. Gal. 4, 4 — 7. Exod. 29, 36, 37. and Ezec. 43, 13 — 27. with Heb. 13, 10— 12. and 2, 9 — 11. and 10, 14, 19, 20. Tit. 3, 4 — 7. Phil. 3, 10. Ephes. 1, 3 — 23. and 5, 23 — 27. Dan. 7, 13, 14, 18, 25, 27. with chapt. 9, 24 — 27. Psal. 91, 11 — 16. Mat. 18, 10, 11. Heb. 1, 3, 13, 14. Of vvhich graces and benefits, seeing all are not partakers, but the elect and beleevers onely: therefore also the Redemption of Christ, and the fruit thereof, perteyneth to these onely, & not to all in the vvorld whosoever. 10. Christ (at his first comming) vvas once offered, to beare the sinnes of the Many, unto vvhom expecting him, he shall appear the second time vvithout sinne, unto salvation. Heb. 9, 28. Which second appearance of his, seeing it shall not be unto all for salvation, but onely to the many spoken off, who are the heires of salvation (as may be seen, in 1 Pet. 1, 2 — 5. Matth. 25, 31 — 46. 1 Thes. 1, 10. and 2 Thes. 1, 6 — 10. Tit. 2, 11 — 14. 1 Ioh. 1, 2, 3. & in the other Scriptures aforesaid:) therefore also Christ was offered to beare the sinnes onely of them, and not of all in the vvorld, whosoever & whatsoe∣ver they be. Herevvith also accord sundry speaches of auncient writers. As vvhen Ambrose saith: God knovveth vvhat the Spirit desireth,Rom. 8, 26, 27. and vvhat is the mynd of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the Saints: as it is written, because euen the Spirit maketh intercession for us. For they for whom Christ suffered; and whom he hath cleansed with his blood, for them doth the spirit also make intercession. Ambros. tom. 2. libr. 5. epist. 23. And Augustine: The Donatists vvould not agree, that by the name of the World, the church could be signified: contrarie to the words of the Apostle, who saith,2 Cor. 5.19. God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself: and contrarie to the words of the Lord himself, who said, The sonne of man came not to judge the world,Ioh. 3, 17. & 12, 47. but that the world through him might be saved. For the world cannot be reconciled to God and saved by him, unlesse that by the name of the World, the church be understood, which onely being reconciled by him is saved. August. tom. 7. lib. contra Donatist. And again: He that spared not his owne sonne,Rom. 8, 32, 33. with ver. 29.30. but delivered him up for us all: how shall he not with him also freely giue all things unto us? But to whom? To us that are foreknowne and predestinated, justified, glorified, of whom it followeth, Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? August. tom. 9, tractat. 45. in Iohan. Again also: Hovv then said he unto these, ye are not of my sheep? Because he saw they were predestinate to eternal destruction,Ioh. 10.26. not ordeyned or purchased to eter∣nall life by the raunsome of his blood. Ibid. tractat. 48. in Iohan. And Cyrill likewise: Christ is novv also subject to the Father:Hebr. 9.14. 1 Pet. 1, 19, 20, 21. yet not for all, but onely for them that beleeue in him, for whom he offered himself, as a lambe without ot unto the Father, that he might offer them unto God, being freed from all sinne. Cyrill. The∣sauri lib. 10. cap. 8. CHAPTER IIII. Touching freewill, or power in our selues unto good, since the fall. VVHether true conversion unto God, & saving faith in Iesus Christ, be not the free gift of God, and the vvork of his grace, power∣fully
vvrought in us, to his praise and glorie: And is not of our selues, or in the povver of our freevvill, as grace is offered, to receiue or to refuse it, to beleeue or not to beleeue, as we will our selues: but is vvholly the free, gracious, and povverfull work of God in us, as is aforesaid. Eph. 1 ch. and 2, 1 — 8, 9, 10. Phil. 1, 29. and 2, 13. Col. 1, 12, 13, 21. 2 Thes. 1, 3, 11, 12. Ioh. 1, 5, 11.12, 13. and 3, 3, 6, 27. and 6, 44, 65. Act. 16, 14. and 26, 15 — 18. Gen. 6, 3, 5. Deut. 30, 6. Job 15, 16. Psal. 51, 5. and 100, 3. Prov. 27, 22. Ier. 31, 18, 33. Ezech. 11, 19, 20. and 16, 6. Iam. 1, 17, 18. 1 Ioh. 3, 1. Heb. 12, 2. and 13, 20, 21. 1. Because saving faith & holynes, is a fruit of Gods election of grace: and therefore is the vvork of his grace & povver in us, to his praise. Act. 13, 48. Ephes. 1, 3, 4. and 2, 8, 9. Tit. 1, 1. Of vvhich, see here before, pag. 222. 2. It is God that maketh us, and not we our selues, to be his people, & the sheep of his pasture. Psal. 100, 3. Ioh. 10, 16, 27, 29. Heb. 13, 20, 21. 1 Pet. 2, 25. It is Gods vvork alone, vvho as he created us at first according to his owne image and likenes: so also createth, regenerateth, & renevveth us againe, by his Spirit in Christ, according to his image in righteousnes & holynes of truth. Gen. 1, 26, 27. vvith Ephes. 4, 24. Col. 3, 10. Ier. 31, 18. Lam. 5, 21. Euen the heathens themselues acknovvledge for our naturall life, that vve are the generation of God, in vvhom vve liue, and moue, and haue our being (as the Apostle alledgeth out of their ovvne vvritings, Act. 17, 28.) And should not then Christians much more acknowledge, for our spirituall life, that our new birth and regeneration is of God: that as our first generation for our naturall life, is not of our ovvne selues, nor in our ovvn power, to vvork or hinder it; so neyther our regeneration or new birth: but is the good & powerful vvork of God in us, by his Spirit through Iesus Christ: to whom he giveth us, and out of vvhose hands none is able to take us. Psal. 139, 14 — 16. &c. with Jam. 1, 18. Joh. 1, 11 — 13. and 3, 3 — 8. and 10, 28, 29. & 17, 6. Tit. 3, 3 — 7. 3. The case and dealing of our first parents, Adam and Eue, vvill make the point more cleare. They, before they fell, had freedome of vvill and abilitie unto good. But vvhen once they had transgressed, al pronenes to evill vvas found in them: but free will and povver unto good, novv they had not. Read and mark the historie vvel, as it is described by Moses, Gen. 3, 7. &c. They knew novv they vvere naked, not onely in body, but in soule also, which vvas deprived of the righteousnes and holynes, which formerly they had, according to the image of God. And vvhat doe they? They sevve figge leaues together, and make themselues aprons. But this concer∣neth but the body: What care vvas there now of the soules nakednes? They neyther seek to God: no nor when God of his mercy commeth & dealeth vvith them, doe they sincerely acknovvledge their sinne, and aske mercie of the Lord, but they put it off from themselues, and colour and cloak it, what they can, &c. The Lord thus shewing in them unto all, that all vvhich we doe or can doe novv of our selues, since the fall, is but to cloak and cover our sinnes as vvith figge leaues: So farre are we from having freedome of vvil & povver of our selues to take, or haue them
taken avvay: unlesse God renew our hearts, and vouchsafe his grace and mercie unto us in Christ. And note vvithall, that if any sinners had free∣will or povver unto good, since the fall, it should haue ben our first pa∣rents, vvho (as all acknovvledge) had it in their integritie: vvhereas their posteritieSee here before, pag 24. are borne in sinne, according to their image, Gen. 5, 3. Psa. 51, 5. not according to the image of God, vvherein they at first were created. Gen. 1, 26, 27. 4. Christ also teacheth, that no man can come unto him, except the fa∣ther dravv him, and giue us unto him. Ioh. 6, 44, 65. and 10, 29. and 17, 6. It is the Father, vvho maketh us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darknes,See also Act. 26.15 — 18. Esa. 42, 7. Zach. 9, 11 Mat. 6, 23 and Ioh. 1, 5. & translated us into the kingdome of his deare sonne. Col. 1, 12, 13. Where vve may obserue further to this purpose, that the word CLEROS used by the Apostle, signifieth a lot, or inheritance that commeth by lot. Which also may teach us, that this renevved estate is the Lords free gift, and his gra∣cious vvork, and disposition; and not ours: as the very nature and use of a lot doth plainly manifest. Lev. 16, 8, 9, 10. Num. 34, 13. vvith Ezec. 47, 13 — 22. Josh. 14, 2. and 15, 1. and 19, 1. Prov. 16, 33. Ionah 1, 7. Act. 1.26. and 13, 19. and 26.18. Psa. 16.5.6. Ephes. 1, 11. vvith Col. 1, 12. 5. Moreover, saving faith is vvrought in us by the Lord, euen by the working of his mightie power, which he vvrought in Christ, when he rai∣sed him up from the dead. Ephes. 1.17 — 19.20. Col. 2, 12, 13. Therefore it neither dependeth on the povver of our vvill, nor (vvhere God vvil work it can be overcome by the untovvardnes and corruption thereof: but is the free gift and vvork of God, effectually vvrought in vvhom it pleaseth him. Ephes. 2.8.9. Phil. 1.29. and 2.13. Joh. 1.11 — 13. 2 Thes. 1.11.12. Ier. 31, 18. 2 Cor. 4.6. 2 Tim. 2.25.26. Heb. 12.2. compared with the Scriptures aforesaid. 6. They also vvhich haue saving faith in Iesus Christ, are made mem∣bers of that mysticall body, vvhereof Christ is the head. Ephes. 1.3 — 22.23. and 4.15.16. Col. 1.18.19. and 2.19. 1 Cor. 12. &c. Therefore, as in the natu∣rall body, the disposition of the members (in this or that place, to this or that use) is not of themselues, but vvholly according to the vvill of God, as it pleaseth him to dispose them: 1 Cor. 12.18. so also in the mysticall body of Christ, the placing of the members therein, is not of our selues, or at the vvill of men, but vvholly according to the vvill & good pleasure of God. For which see the Scriptures before alledged, and the treatise of Gods decree of election, here spoken of before, pag. 221. 7. We are by nature dead (not half dead, or partly dead) in sinnes and trespasses. Ephes. 2.1.2.3.5.12.13 — 22. Col. 2.13. Ioh. 5.25. Therefore it is not of us, or in the povver of our vvill, to quicken or convert our selues spiri∣tually: as it is not in the vvill or povver of a dead man, to quicken him∣self naturally, or to raise up himself unto life againe. The vvaters of the sea, vvhereof Ezechiel speaketh (called the dead sea, vvhere Sodome and Gomorrha stood) are healed; not by any thing in or of themselues, but onely by vertue of the living vvaters, vvhich come into them out of the
house of God. Ezech. 47, 1 — 8. &c. Zach. 14.8.9. vvith Rev. 22.1.2. And vvhen Lazarus vvas dead, he vvas raised up againe, not at his ovvne vvill, or by any povver in himself: but onely of the grace and by the povver of our Lord Iesus Christ. Ioh. 11.14 — 44. So likevvise it is not of our selues, or in the povver of our ovvn vvill, but of the grace and by the povver of God, to quicken and raise us up unto life, vvhen vve are dead in sinnes & tres∣passes. As vve are taught in the Scriptures aforesaid, and other the like. When I passed by thee (saith the Lord to Israel) and savv thee polluted (or giving thy self to be troden under foot) in thine owne blood, I said unto thee, when th wast in thy blood, Liue: yea I said unto thee, when thou vvast in thy blood, Liue. Ezec. 16, 6. Where marke, that he speaketh and repeateth it againe, and again. I said unto thee, when thou vvast in thy blood, Liue. The like againe may be obser∣ved in the dead bones, vvhich were quickned by the Lord, as Ezechiell likewise sheweth, Ezech. 37.1 — 14. 8. The Scripture also and experience teacheth, that vve are flesh: and the verie thoughts and imaginations of the heart of man are onely evill continually, euen from his youth, Gen. 6, 3, 5. and 8, 21. Psal. 14, 2. with Rom. .9, 10, 11, 12, 19, 23. 1 Cor. 2, 14. 2 Cor. 3, 5. Mat. 6, 23. John 3, 6. Galat. 5, 17, 19, 20, 21. Iude, v. 18, 19. Our vvill is become the servant of sinne: seeing we our selues are the servants of sinne, and free from righteousnes; the children of wrath and disobedience; fulfilling the will of the flesh and of the mynd; yea being in the snare of the Divell, taken aliue captiue by him at his vvill. Rom. 8, 20— 23. & 3, 10, 11, 12. Ioh. 1, 13. and 8, 34. Ephes. 2, 1, 2, 3. 2 Tim. 2, 26. Tit. 3, 3. Col. 1, 21. A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit. Mat. 7, 18. Iob. 14, 4. Man is abominable and filthie, which drinketh iniquitie like vvater. Iob 15, 16. We are all borne in iniquitie, & in sinne did our mothers con∣ceiue us. Psal. 51, 5. Our hearts are stonie, hard, and unplyable, to beleeue, and obey the word of God. Ezech. 11, 19, 20. with Gen. 6, 5. Jer. 17, 9. Psal. 64, 6. Therefore it is and needs must be Gods free gift of grace, & his power∣full vvork (vvho is able to bring light out of darknes, and water out of the stony rock) to take avvay the stony heart out of our flesh, and to giue us an heart of flesh, that is soft, and wherein the law of God may be written by his Spirit, to convert and renevv us; to work in us both to wil, and to doe, of his good pleasure, and to his praise. 2 Cor. 4, 6. Ezec. 11, 19, 20. and 36, 25, 26, 27. vvith Exod. 17, 6. Ier. 10, 23. and 31, 18, 33, 34. Phil. 2, 13. Psal. 10, 17. Joh. 3, 3.6.27. and 6.44.65. and 8, 36. Heb. 12, 2. and 13, 20, 21. 9. This appeareth further, in that no exhortations, persvvasions, cor∣rections, punishments, or other meanes can prevaile vvith men, to bring us to godlines, unles God renew us by his spirit. (2 Chron. 36, 14, 15, 16. Esa. 1.5. and 65, 1, 2. Jer. 25.1 — 7. and 31, 18, 33, 34. Isal. 143, 10. Mat. 6, 10. Ioh. 3, 3, 6.8. Phil. 2, 13.) Nay men often become more hardened, and vvaxe worse and vvorse notwithstanding any meanes that can be used unto them, ac∣cording to the Proverbe vvhich saith: Though thou bray a foole in a morter yet will not his foolishnes depart from him. Prov. 27, 22. AndRom. 4, 15 and 7, 8. &c. the Lavv vvorketh vvrath, (saith the Apostle) and increaseth sinne, and maketh it more appeare. So
corrupt we are in our selues, so prone unto all evill, so unvvilling and un∣able to that vvhich is good; untill and unles it please God to convert and renew us by his Spirit and grace in Christ, as is aforesaid. And who is there (exceptHabak. 2, 4. his soule be lift up, and not upright in him) that doth not know and find in himself, that we can not beleeue or obey, eyther vvhen we would, or vvhat we vvould, or as we would: but as it pleaseth God of his grace and by his power to performe his good vvork in us, to his praise? Nm. 20, 12. Mat. 6, 30. and 14, 30, 31. Mar. 4, 40. and 9, 23, 24. Luk. 8, 25. and 17, 5. and 22, 32. Rom. 7, 8 — 25. 2 Thes. 1, 11, 12. Object. But here some object, and aske, To vvhat ende then are com∣mandements giuen, and exhortations used, if we haue not free vvill and povver in our selues to obey and performe them? Are they all giuen & used in vaine? Doth God so mock with men? Or should we so abuse one another? &c. Ansvv. 1. I also aske, vvhat need there is, or to what end it is, that vve should pray unto God, to convert and quicken us; to create in us a clean heart; to giue us his spirit; to incline our hearts to his testimonies; to u∣nite our heart to feare his name; to fulfill the work of faith in us with power; & to vvork in us that which is vvell pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ: if it be in our ovvne vvill and power to doe these things, if we please, when vve are so required and exhorted thereunto? Jer. 31, 18. Psal. 51, 10, 11, 12. and 86, 11. and 119.36, 37, 38.156. and 143, 10, 11. Luk. 11, 13. and 17, 5. 2 Thes. 1, 11. Heb 13, 20, 21. May we pray unto God idly or need∣lessely? Must not all our prayers be made in faith? Or shall we thus set the commandements and exhortations of God giuen unto us, and our prayers made unto him, in a contradiction one against another? Far be it from us. Rather let us be carefull to understand and use them both a∣ght. And let us learne euen by this point, of our praying unto God (as is a∣fresaid) hovv unsound their doctrine of free vvill, and of the povver thereof in us unto good, is and must needs be. But it hath ben mans old and woonted corruption, to beHabak. 1.16. sacrificing still to our own net: as these novv vvould to their ovvne vvill and power, Ans. 2. The exhortations & commandements spoken off, are meanes and instruments, vvhich it pleaseth the Spirit of God to use, thereby to vvork in us, that vvhich he requireth of us. And so they are neyther idle or fruitlesse, neither yet doe they argue freedome of wil or povver in our selues to performe them, if we will. When darknes was upon the face of the deep. God said, Let there be light, and there was light. Gen. 1, 2, 3. Here the commandement of God, was the meanes which it pleased God to use to bring forth light out of darknes: and was neither vaine or fruitlesse, nei∣ther implieth vvill or povver in the darkenes and deep themselues here∣. Which is the more to be regarded, because the Apostle Paul useth  similitude in the like argument, saying, God who commanded  out of darknes, hath sined in our hearts to giue the light of the knowledge of the  of God, in the face of Iesus Christ. 2 Cor. 4, 6. where he sheweth, that faith
or the saving knovvledge of God in Iesus Christ, is the mightie and singu∣lar work of Gods power in us; euen as the bringing of light out of dark∣nes vvas at the beginning, Ephes. 1, 19, 20. vvith 2 Cor. 4, 6. And Christ, by another similitude teacheth the same, when he saith, The hower is comming, and novv is, when the dead shall heare the voice of the sonne of God: and they that heare, shall liue. Joh. 5, 25. Like as may be observed in that case, vvhereof the Prophet Ezechiell speaketh: who when he vvas bidden by the Lord to say unto the dry bones, O ye dry bones, heare the vvord of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones, Behold, I vvill cause breath to enter into you, and ye shal liue; and I vvill lay sinevves upon you, &c. then saith he, So I prophecied as I was commanded: and as I prophecied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together bone to his bone, &c. Ezec. 37.4 — 7. &c. Where again it ap∣peareth, that the Prophets speach or exhortation to the dead and drye bones, was the meanes vvhich the Lord vvould use in that case: and nei∣ther was vaine or fruitles, neither yet implieth abilitie in the dead bones themselues to performe the thing so required of them. The same Pro∣phet noteth the like about himself, when he vvas falne on his face, at the sight of the vision, which the Lord shevved him, first noting hovv a voice said unto him, Sonne of man, stand upon thy feet, and I vvill speak unto thee: and then presently annexing, saith, and the spirit entred into me, when he spake un∣to me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me: &c. Eze. 2.1.2. vvith chap. 1, 28. and 3, 23, 24. The like againe may be observed in the Lords dealing with Daniel: and so is noted by himself, Dan. 10.8 — 19. And in Christs dealing with Lazarus, vvhen he raised him up from death, Ioh. 11.43.44. vvith ver. 40, 41, 42. And as touching the preaching and ministerie of the word (vvhereabout the objection is much urged) we read in the Acts of the Apostles, hovv vvhen Luke had noted that Lydia being together vvith other vvomen assembled, heard the Apostle speak unto them: he presently an∣nexeth, that the Lord opened her heart, that she attended to the things spoken by Paul. And so she became a Christian, and was baptised and her houshold. Act. 16, 14, 15. Which likewise shevveth, that instruction and exhortation is a meanes vvhich it pleaseth God to use; and yet that the fruit thereof de∣pendeth upon the Lords ovvne gracious and powerfull vvorking in us thereby, as he pleaseth. Whereupon it was, that the vvord spoken by the Apostle, vvas more fruitfull in Lydia, then in the other persons that were there also met together, to vvhom Paul spake, asvvell as unto her. Act. 16.13.14. Without vvhich vvork and blessing of the Lord, no increase fol∣loweth, whatsoever meanes be used: as vvas shewed here before. Where∣unto may be referred, that the Apostle saith, I haue planted, Apollo vvatered, but God gaue the increase. 1 Cor. 3, 6. It is God (saith the Apostle) that giveth the increase; He saith not, I haue planted, Apollo vvatered: but it is of men themselues, vvhen the grace is offered, to receiue or to refuse it, and so to haue some increase, or none at all, as pleaseth themselues. The Apostles teach not so: but their doctrine leadeth us to acknovvledge the meanes used by God; and yet thereupon neyther to debase the vvork of God, nor to advance the vvill or povver
of man, vvho is dead in sinne, and alienated in mynd,  the flesh, and of the mynd, till vve be quickned, converted, and renevved by the Lord. Ans. 3. Besides, God may vvell so speak unto man, as he made him at first, in holynes and righteousnes, having free vvill and abilitie unto that vvhich vvas good and holy. Whereof novv being deprived by his ovvne voluntarie fall and transgression, the blame therefore lyeth upon our selues, that vve are not able to performe the commandements & ex∣hortations giuen unto us, unlesse it please God to renevv us, and to vvork in us both to vvill, and to doe, of his good pleasure. Gen. 1, 26. and 3.1 — 7. and 5.3. Eccl. 7.29. vvith Ephes. 4.20— 24. Phil 2.13. Ans. 4. Othervvise in this our corrupt estate, vve find that the Lavv vvorketh vvrath, and increaseth sinne, and maketh it more appear: vve being in our selues miserably corrupted since the fall, and more and more hardned in evill, vvithout the grace of God, and povverfull vvorking of his spirit in us, as is aforesaid. Rom. 4.14.15. and 7.8.9. &c. Ans. 5. And thus also may be observed, hovv the commandements and exhortations spoken off, shevv our dutie, rather then our abilitie. As the Lavv shevveth us vvhat vve ought to doe, not vvhat vve are able to doe. Whereof vve may likewise make good use, to know our own weak∣nes and sinfulnes the more; that so being humbled in our selues, we may pray unto God for his grace and mercie; & that he would work in us his owne good vvork, with power, to the praise and glorie of his name, in Iesus Christ. Which is another good use of the commandements and ex∣hortations giuen unto us. 10. Finally, the contrarie doctrine derogateth greatly from the glorie of God, and giveth unto man part of the glorie of our conversion and sal∣vation. For look how much we ascribe to the will and power of man, so much in very deed vve take from the grace and work of God. And if it be in our selues, and in the power of our own vvill, to turne unto God, & to exempt our selues from others that doe it not, then should we haue so far forth whereof to glorie. But most sure it is, that we haue not where of to glorie vvith God herein, vvho vvill haue the full and vvhole glorie to himself, of our conversion and salvation in Christ. Therefore in this respect also the contrarie doctrine is erroneous, & not according to the truth of the gospell. 1 Cor. 1, 26 — 31. and 4, 7. Ephes. 2, 8, 9. 2 Thes. 1, 11, 12. com∣pared vvith Joh. 7, 18. and 16, 13, 14. Herewith also agree some sayings of the auncient Writers. As vvhen Augustine saith, Free will to loue God vve haue lost by the greatnes of the first sinne. August. tom. 2. epist. 107. ad Vitalem. And againe, Man using free vvill yll, lost both it and himself. Ibid. tom. 3. Enchiridio ad Laurentium, cap. 30. Petrus Diaconus and others, What could or can be borne of a servant, but a servant? For Adam when he was free begate not children, but after he vvas made the servant of sinne. Therefore as everie one is of him, so also everie man is the servant of
sinne through him. Petr. Diac. &c. de incarnatione & gratia Christi, seu de gratia & libero arbitrio, cap. 6. And Fulgentius, Hold firmely, and doubt not at all, that no man can come to re∣pentance, but whom God inlighteneth, and converteth of his gracious mercy & compas∣sion. Fulgent or August. lib. de fide ad Petrum Diaconum. cap. 31. And thus much concerning free vvill, or power in our selues unto good, since the Fall. CHAPTER V. Touching the perseverance of the Saints, that are truely god∣ly, and syncerely beleeue in Jesus Christ. VVHether the Saints of God, such as faithfully beleeue, being made partakers of the spirit of adoption, & ingrafted into Iesus Christ by true and living faith, are not by the grace & povver of God in Christ so guided, susteyned, and preserved, as they shall not, and (in respect of God) can not, wholly and for ever fall avvay from the Lord, & utterly be rejected by him, and loose that his quickning spirit, and saving faith in Iesus Christ: Although they be subject still in this life, through infirmitie of the flesh in themselues, to fall into sinne, & sometimes also into great and grievous sinnes: As may be seen in Noah, David, Peter, &c. 2 Cor. 1, 19 — 22. Ephes. 1, 13, 14. and 3, 16 — 20. and 5, 23. Rom. 8, 15 — 23. 1 Joh. 5, 1 — 13 1 Cor. 1, 4 — 9. Esa. 54, 8, 9, 10. and 55, 3. with Act. 13, 34. Ier. 31, 31 — 37. and 32.40. Amos 9, 9.

Because the graces and fruits aforesaid, (namely, the spirit of ad∣option, & faith in Iesus Christ, with the fruits thereof) are certain pledges and assurances of Gods eternall election unto salvation: as hath ben shewed before, pag. 222. Novv as God himself, so his decree and loue to∣ward his elect for salvation, is unchangeable: & therefore it cannot be, that those vvhom he hath chosen unto life eternall, should by him again for ever be rejected, and become reprobate unto condemnation: and so to fall utterly from the Lord, & to be deprived for ever of his quickning spirit and saving faith in Iesus Christ. Mal. 3, 6. and Exod. 3, 14, 15. Jam. 1, 17. Heb. 6, 17, 18, 19, 20. Mat. 24, 24, 31, 34. 1 Sam. 15, 29. Psal. 102, 13, 14, 27, 28. Ier. 31, 3. Joh. 13, 1. compared with 2 Cor. 1, 19 — 22.

Rom. 8, 29 — 39. 2 Els it vvould follow, eyther that such were not the Lords, & giuen unto Christ; or that the Lord is overtaken and deceived in his decree & election of grace; or not able to preserue them, by his grace & power, to eternall life: but that they vvhich are his sheep, for whom Christ layd
dovvne his life, might notvvithstanding perish, and be plucked out of his hands. Contrarie to the doctrine of Christ, Mat. 24, 24, 31, 35. Ioh. 3, 8, 14, 15, 16. and 5, 24. and 6, 35, 37, 39, 40, 56, 57, 58. and 10, 15, 27, 28, 29. And contra∣rie to his prayer, Ioh. 17, 20.24. with 14, 16. Contrarie also to the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, Esa. 54, 9, 10. and 55, 3. with Act. 13, 34. Jer. 31, 31 — 37. and 32, 40. Habak. 2, 2, 3, 4. with Rom. 1, 16, 17. and 4.20— 25. and 8.29.30. 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. 1 Iohn 5.4.13.18. Revel. 13.8. and 21.27. and 22.6 — 9. And contrarie to their assured perswasion (recorded, for our instruction and comfort, in the Scriptures) vvhen they say, I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shal stand at the latter day, upon the earth; &c. Job 19, 25. And againe, I know whom I haue beleeved, and I am perswaded, that he is able to keep that which I haue committed unto him against that day. 2 Tim. 1, 12. And (vvhen the Apostle speaketh of all the elect, saying) Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that dyed, yea rather that is risen again, who is euen at the right hand of God, who also maketh inter∣cession for us. Who shall separate us from the loue of Christ? Shall tribulation, or di∣stresse, or persecution, or famine, or nakednes, or perill, or sword? &c. Nay, in al these things vve are more then conquerours, through him that loved us. For I am perswaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shalbe able to separate us from the loue of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord. Rom. 8, 33 — 39. 3. Neyther els could vve (in this life) haue assurance of salvation in Christ: but should still be wavering and in doubt: and so be left without sound comfort, in the midst of the manifold tentations and afflictions of this life. Like as cometh to passe by the erroneous doctrine of the Papists in this and other like points of their religion. Contrarie also to the assu∣red promise of God, the true nature of faith, and the gracious testimonie of Gods spirit, and fruits thereof in us. (Besides the examples of such, as are recorded in the Scriptures to haue had assurance of salvation, and of perseverance to the end: As vvas shewed in some examples here before.) Psal. 119.49.50. and 56.3.4.9 — 13. and 62 1.2. and 116.10. vvith 2 Cor. 4.13.14. Psa. 55.3. vvith Act. 13.34. Iohn 5.24. and 6.35.37.39.40. and 10.27.28.29. and 14.27. and 16.33. and 20.31.

Els also, the righteousnes vvhich novv we haue by the redemption of Christ, should not be more stable and firme unto us, then the righte∣ousnes vvhich Adam, or the Angels, had by creation, in that first estate of integritie. For Adam fell from his righteousnes; and many of the An∣gels also from theirs, leaving their first estate: Whereas they vvhich are redeemed by Christ, and made partakers of his righteousnes (having it once sealed in their hearts by the spirit of God) shal never loose it again. For the redemption vvhich Christ hath wrought for the elect, and the righteousnes vvhich he hath brought in for us by his death, is eternall. Dan. 9.24. Hebr. 9.12.24.28, and Rom. 8.15.23.30.33.34, 38.39. 2 Cor. 1.21.22.

And they vvhich trust in the Lord, and are built upon Christ the rock, by faith in him, are (as the Scripture saith) like mount Sion, vvhich cannot be removed, but standeth for ever. Psal. 125.1. And like the vvise man, which buildeth his house on a rock: against vvhich all the raine, floods, vvinds, and stormes, that fall and beat upon it, can not prevaile to make it fall: because it is founded upon a rock. Mat. 7.24.25. and 24.24. 5. Besides that if one of the elect and faithful beleevers in Christ, may vvholly fal away from the Lord, & be rejected for ever: then also might another, and another: and so all of them. For vve haue all, like precious faith vvith the Apostles themselues (though in several measure and degrees) through the righteousnes of God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ. 2 Pet. 1.1. And thus the faith (novv spoken of) is fitly called the faith of Gods elect. Tit. 1.1. If therefore any, and so all, of the elect and faithfull beleevers in Christ, might vvholly fall avvay from the Lord, and be rejected for ever: how then were the decree of Gods election eternall and unchangeable, as vvas shevved be∣fore? hovv should the promise of God to his people be certain & ever∣lasting? how is the covenant of Gods grace certainly confirmed by the death of Christ, for salvation to his elect through the blood of his crosse? vvhere and what should be the benefit of Christs faithfull keeping and preservation of his people? vvhat vvould be the fruit and comfort of the gracious presence and povverfull working of the Spirit of Sanctification in us? Finally, vvhere should now be the certaintie and stabilitie of the grace, power, glorie, and kingdome of God in Christ, for and through the salvation of the elect and faithfull? Which the whole Scripture teacheth us to ascribe unto God, with praise & thanks for evermore. Mat. 6.9 — 13. compared vvith Ephes. 1.3.4.5.6.7. Rom. 8.29 — 34. Gal. 3.13.14.15. Heb. 9.11 — 16.28.

Hereunto may be added the consideration of the dignities, privi∣ledges, and comforts of the godly: which the Scripture so plentifully sheweth & describeth. As for example that they are the sonnes & daugh∣ters of God, his children, and joint heyres vvith Christ. 1 Iohn 3.1. and Joh. 1.12. Rom. 8.15.16.17.29. Gal. 4.5 6.7. vvith 2 Cor. 6.18. Mat. 9.2.22.

That haue all things vvork together for good unto them. Rom. 8, 28. And though they fall, yet shall not utterly be cast downe, because the Lord upholdeth them vvith his hand. Psal. 37, 24. That they haue redemption through the blood of Iesus Christ, the forgiuenes of sinnes, according to the riches of the grace of God, in Christ his sonne. Eph. 1, 7. Col. 1, 12 — 14.
That Christ dvvelleth in them, by faith, and by his spirit, Joh. 6, 56. Eph. 3, 17. 1 Joh. 4, 13. and that by him they shall liue for ever. Ioh: 6, 57, 58. That they haue the first fruits of the spirit, and are sealed with the holy spirit of pro∣mise, vvhich is the pledge and earnest of our inheritance: being giuen us of the Lord, as a pawne for certain assurance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glorie. Rom. 8, 23. 2 Cor. 1, 21, 22. Eph. 1, 13, 14. That they shal never be rejected by Christ, Ioh. 6, 37. nor can be taken out of his hands by any other. Ioh. 10, 28.29. Shall never be se∣parated from the loue of God, vvhich is in Christ Iesus, Rom. 8, 38, 39. nor can be seduced to destructiō, by any meanes. Mat. 24, 24. Shall never hun∣ger, or thirst, Ioh. 6, 35. and 4, 14. Shall never perish, or come into condem∣nation, but passe from death unto life. Ioh. 5, 24. with 3, 16. & 17.3.12.15.24. Having fellovvship, not onely vvith the Apostles, but euen with God the Father, and vvith his sonne Iesus Christ. 1 Ioh. 1, 3. 1 Cor. 10, 16. And made partakers of the divine nature, and of al things perteyning to life & god∣lines, yea euen of eternall life (though not in that measure and maner, as shalbe after this life, in the kingdome of heauen, for ever) 2 Pet. 1, 3, 4. 1 Ioh. 5, 4, 12, 13, 20. compared vvith 1 Cor. 13, 9, 10. Col. 3, 3. 1 Ioh. 3, 2. 7. Finally, seing all acknovvledge that the Lord (by his grace & pow∣er) keepeth the elect Angels, that they fall not from their integritie: but are preserved and confirmed in goodnes to the enjoying of eternal hap∣pines: Why should we not also beleeue, that God both can and vvill (through his grace & power in Christ) preserue al his elect among men, vvho (though vve fell from our integritie in our first parents, yet) are though his grace redeemed frō wrath by the death of Christ his sonne, and begotten againe to a liuely hope, by the resurrection of Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heauen for us, who are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation, vvhich is ready to be revealed in the last time. 1 Tim. 5, 21. compared vvith Heb. 12, 22. and 1, 13, 14. Luke 20, 36. Col. 2, 10. Rev. 22, 6 — 9. 1 Pet. 1, 3, 4, 5 — 9 — 12. and 5, 1, 10, 11. Whereunto agree some speaches of the auncient Writers. viz, That llian saith, As he hath left unto us the earnest of the Spirit, so hath he also taken of us the  of the flesh, and caried it into heauen as a pledge that the whole summe shall in time be  thither. Be ye therefore confident, O flesh and blood, you haue taken possession both of  and of the kingdome of God in Christ. Tertul. lib. de resur. carnis, cap. 51. And Augustine, He therefore maketh them persevere in good, that maketh them to be good. But they that fall and perish, were not in the number of them that are predestinate. August. tom.  de correptione & gratia, cap. 12. Also, Being freed from sinne they are made the servants of righteousnes, in which they shall stand unto the end, he giving unto them perseverance, who  new them, and predestinated them, and according to his purpose hath called, and justified, and glorified them. Ibid. And againe, This perseverance God hath promised, saying,Jer. 32 40. I will put my feare in their heart, that they shall not depart from me. Which what other thing is it, but that such and so great shalbe my feare, which I will put in their heart, as they shall cleane unto me with perseverance. Ibid. lib. de bono perseverantiae, cap. 2. And hitherto of the perseverance of the Saints, which sincerely be∣leeue in Iesus Christ.
The conclusion: and general confirmation of the points aforesaid. ANd novv for a summarie confirmation of the premisses, and conclu∣sion of the severall matters aforesaid, let me also annexe this reason in generall, as followeth: Whatsoever doctrines or opinions derogate from the glorie of God in Christ, and giue unto man part of the glorie of our salvation: those are erroneous doctrines and opinions, and such as cannot agree vvith the truth vvhich is according to godlines. Joh. 16, 13, 14. and 7, 18. 1 Cor. 1, 26, 27 — 31. Ier 9, 23, 24. Ephes. 2, 8, 9. vvith Tit. 1, 1. But such are the doctrines and opinions of the Anabaptists, Arminians and others, touching the points aforesaid: as in the particulars thereof may be seen. The Anabaptists derogate from the glorie of God, in that they doe not acknowledge the extent, and stabilitie, of his covenant; and the seale thereof, according to his vvord, and vvork. And in their opini∣ons and practise, they both adde unto, and take from the word of God. They adde in their repeating or renewing of Baptisme, which God hath not appointed to be done: And they take away from it, both in that they deny the baptisme received in apostate churches to be true baptisme, and Gods signe and seale of his covenant; and in vvith-holding of baptisme from children, to vvhom God hath ordeyned the signe and seale of his covenant to be giuen: as hath ben shevved here before, pag. 1 — 27. &c. The Arminians also in their opinions derogate from Gods glorie, and advance fraile man: namely, in the tvvo first of the points aforesaid tou∣ching Gods decree: vvhiles they ground not the eternall decree of God, wholly and onely on the good pleasure of his vvill: but upon the faith & holines, unbelief or wickednes of men, foreseen: In the third, by exten∣ding the redemption of Christ, further then the intendement of God; yea euen to the reprobate them selues: In the fourth, by ascribing our con∣version and salvation; in part, to our selues & our owne free vvill: & not vvholly and onely to the free gift of God, and povverfull vvork of his grace in us: In the first and last, by debasing (in deed) the unchangeable decree and firme promises of God; the mightie power and faithfull cu∣stodie of Christ our Lord, the comfortable presence, assured pledge, and gracious vvork, of the holy Ghost, in his Saints and faithfull people. Therefore such doctrines and opinions of theirs are erroneous, and greatly disagreeing from the truth vvhich is according to godlines. Let him that readeth consider. And the Lord giue us aright to under∣stand his vvord, humbly to obey his vvill, and faithfully to hold his truth, unto the end, Amen. Now unto him that is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultlesse before the presence of his glorie with exceeding joy; to the onely wise God our Saviour, be glorie and majestie, dominion and power, now and ever. Amen. Jude v. 24.25.
THE THIRD TREATISE Of some things which concerne the worship of God, and order of the Church: especially con∣cerning the Reformed Churches. HAving now briefly treated of these points of Religion, which are called in question betvveen the Remonstrants, and others of the Reformed Churches: I will here also annexe some other things concerning the Reformed Churches themselues. Which I acknowledge to be the Churches of Christ: and with whom I agree both in the faith of Christ, and in many things concerning the order and government of the church. Yet because there are some particulars (of vvaight) touching the vvorship of God, and policie of the Church, wherein I think they are not as yet come to the synceritie of the Primi∣tiue Churches constitution; and am persvvaded that the Lord is now bringing his churches and people thereunto (from the apostasie and cor∣ruptions of Antichrist the man of sinne:) and that he vvill in time accom∣plish this his work already begun, (vvhether before or together with the conversion of the Iewes to the Christian faith, the Lord knovveth, and time vvill manifest:) therefore haue I thought it good herevvithal to note some few things thereabout. The particulars are not all of them of like waight or evidence (in mine ovvne perswasion) but some of them such, as far more may be said and borne vvith about them, then about others of them. Neyther doe all of them concerne al the Reformed churches alike: but some of them more, and some lesse: inasmuch as their estate in divers Churches and places doth diversly differ hereabout. Yet notvvithstanding I thought it not a∣misse thus to propound thē here together: desiring of al, that they would seriously consider these things, in the fear of God, and according to his word; & hoping that the due consideration thereof wil (through the bles∣sing of God) become profitable for the furtherance of the truth, and fur∣ther building up of the church, to the praise of his name, in Iesus Christ. CHAPTER I. Touching Book prayer. VVHether it be the Lords ordinance, that his churches & servants, should (vvhen they pray) read their prayers out of a book, euen certaine set vvords imposed by men; and so use a forme and manner of
prayer and leitourgie devised and prescribed by man, for their spirituall sacrifice of prayer and vvorship of God: And consequently, vvhether it be lavvfull for us, in such maner to vvorship the Lord. Exod. 20, 4, 5, 6. and 30, 9. compared with Psal. 141, 2. Esa. 29, 13. vvith Mat. 15, 9. Lev. 10, 1, Mal. 1.8, 14. Rom. 8, 26. Ephes. 4, 8 — 12. 1 Pet. 2, 5. Rev. 8, 3, &c. I. Seeing that the book-prayer aforesaid, being not appointed by the Lord, or approved in his word, is an invention of Man in the vvorship of God. And mens inventions in Gods vvorship, are transgressions of the second commandement. Exod. 20, 4, 5. vvith Lev. 10, 1. Judg. 8, 27. Psa. 119, 113, 128. Esa. 29, 13. and 30, 21, 22, II. Thus also it is as an image & similitude of spiritual prayer, which yet it is not. And so these books and stinted prayers prescribed by man, in the vvorship of God, come in deed to be idols, supplying the place of the vvord and spirit of God▪ vvhich ought not to be. In vvhich respect, such manner of worship becommeth idolatrous & superstitious, forbid∣den of the Lord, and not to be communicated vvithall. For vvhat agree∣ment hath the temple of God vvith Idols? 2 Cor. 6.16. Exod. 20, 4, 5, 6. com∣pared vvith Rom. 8, 26. Ephes 6, 18. 1 Pet. 2, 5. and vvith the other Scriptures afore∣said, and the like. III. The incense offred by the Priests upon the golden Altar in the time of the Lavv, vvas a type of prayer offred up unto God by the medi∣ation of Christ: Psal. 141, 2. Rev. 8, 3, 4. And therefore as it vvas not lavv∣full to use any straunge incense, but that onely vvhich God appointed: so neither is it lavvful to use any straunge manner of prayer, but such onely as the Lord requireth. Exod. 30, 9. vvith Psal. 141, 2. Now that the Lord did ever ordeyne in his vvorship the book-prayer aforesaid, vvho can shevv? Yea, or that any of the godly (either the Patriarks, Prophets, Apostles, or other men or vvomen) recorded in the Scriptures, when they vvould pray unto God, did ever take a book in their hands, to read out of it some stin∣ted prayers prescribed by men, for their sacrifice of prayer and supplica∣tion to God? Or can vve think, if this vvere the manner of prayer and worship vvhich God required, that the Scripture would be silent in it; or that none of the servants of God set before us for examples in the Scri∣ptures, should ever use it; or that vve should prescribe or use such man∣ner of prayer in the worship of God, as never any of the godly mētioned in the Scripture did use? If then in the time of the Legall shadovves un∣der Moses, God vvould not admit of any straunge thing in his worship, but did severely punish it, as may be seen in the example of Nadab and Abihu, Levit. 10, 1. hovv shall vve thinke that he vvill novv admit of any straunge manner of prayer for his worship in the time of the Gospel un∣der Christ; whenas Christ the sonne is vvorthy of more honour, then Moses the servant. Heb. 3, 3, 5, 6. IIII. It derogateth from the honour, fruit, and benefit of the ascen∣sion of Christ: vvho ascending up on high, hath giuen gifts unto men for the worke of the ministerie: and therefore as vvell for prayer, as for
doctrine and preaching &c. Eph. 4, 8, 12. vvith Act. 6, 4. If any be not in∣dued vvith such gifts, there is no vvarrant to chuse them to be ministers of Christ. If they be so indued, there is no vvarrant for others to pre∣scribe, nor for themselues to read over such stinted prayers, prescribed by men for the worship of God. Neither doeth it onely derogate from the honour and benefit of Christs ascension into heauen: but also from the care, loue, and bountie that he hath and shevveth continually to his church upon earth, giving still gifts unto men for the vvork of the mini∣sterie, from time to time. Ephes. 4, 8 — 13. and Psal. 68, 19. vvith 1 Cor. 12, 4, 5, 6. 1 Tim. 2, 1. and 6, 13, 14. with Matth. 28, 20. Els also why doe they not put a book of Homilies, in the hands of all the Ministers, to be read over dayly for their sermons to the people, asvvell as a book of prayers, in and for the worship of God? And vvhy doe not the ministers use the one, aswel as the other, in their publick ministration? V. The spirit of God is the onely help which he giueth us to help our infirmities in the time of prayer: (not books, or beads, or any such thing▪) Rom. 8, 26, 27. Gal. 4, 6. Zach. 12, 10. Ephes. 6, 18. Iude ver. 20. And hovv els should blinde men pray, that cannot read? Besides that Book-prayer quencheth the spirit, and abridgeth the work of the holy Ghost, suppres∣sing the gifts and graces of God in us, and removing the heart far from God, hovvever we may seeme with the mouth to come neare unto him: inasmuch as our prayers are not dravven and powred out of the heart by the help of the spirit of God, according to our present and continuall occasions: but are prescribed unto us, and read in a book, still alike, from time to time, 1 Thes. 5, 17, 18, 19. Esa. 29, 13. compared with 1 Sam. 1, 15. Zach. 12, 10. Phil. 4, 6. VI. We our selues as living stones, are built up a spirituall house, an holy Priesthood, to offer up spirituall sacrifices, acceptable to God by Iesus Christ. 1 Pet. 2, 5. vvith Iohn 4, 24. Rev. 1, 5, 6. Therefore also should we not read our prayers out of a book, when we worship God: seeing it is not a living or spiritual sacrifice, but dead & carnal: And hovv then is it a vvor∣ship acceptable to God by Iesus Christ? as all our prayers and worship of God should be. 1 Pet. 4, 5. with Rev. 8, 3. Rom. 8, 26, 27. 1 Thes. 5, 17, 18. 1 Tim. 2, 1 — 5. 1 Joh. 5, 13, 14, 15. Iude v. 20, 21. VII. Prayer is to be made, for things that are needfull, and lawfull to be asked of God, according to the severall occasions, estate, & conditions of people, publikely and privately, joyntly and severally, in churches and common vveales, by sea and by land, in peace and in warre, in prosperitie and adversitie, spirituall and bodily, &c. and thanksgiving againe accor∣dingly to be rendred unto God upon the prayers heard, &c. as through∣out the Scriptures may be seen, Phil. 4, 6. and 1 Thes 5, 17, 18. compared with Gen. 32, 9 — 12.

Which doth yet the more make against Book prayer: that is stil read over, thirtie, fif∣tie, an hundred, yea many hundreds of yeares: as if God never heard our prayers; or gaue not continually several occasions of prayer, to churches and people of all sorts, publick and private: vvhich none can conceiue, much lesse expresse the manifold and unspeakable particulars thereof. VIII. If Book-prayer vvere the ordinance of God, why did not the Prophets and Apostles make such books of prayer, & leaue them to the church, as they did their other vvritings, for continuall use, publike and private? Or shall vve think, that they were unfaithfull to the Lord,  unsufficient for this vvork, if it had ben committed unto them? Or that those which make or prescribe such books, are more wise, more carefull, more sufficient, then they were? Moses saith, Ye shal not adde unto the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the Commandements of the Lord your God, which I command you. Deut. 4, 2. and 12, 32. The Prophet Esay sends all, to the Law and to the testimonie: affirming that  men speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. Esa. 8.2. The Apostle saith, that he delivered to the churches, what he received of the Lord: and shunned not to declare unto them all the counsell of God. Act 20.27. 1 Cor. 11.1.2.23. and 14.37. And he straitly chargeth Timothee (and in him all the mini∣sters of Christ) to keep the commandement (giuen in that Epistle of his) without spot, and unrebukeable, untill the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Tim 6, 13, 12. Either therefore Book-prayer is none of Gods counsels, cōmandements, and ordinances: or if it were, the Prophets and Apostles haue delivered such books to the Churches, and ministers of God, with commandement accordingly to use them. Which if any could bring forth, the question were soone ended. But if the Prophets & Apostles never made, nor ever appointed others to make, such books of praier, for such use, as is afore∣said: by vvhat right then may any take upon them, to make, prescribe, or use them, in such sort, as churches and people now dayly doe? Or hovv shall we assure our selues, or others, that it is not a will vvorship, devied by man, and displeasing to God? IX. Yea and let it be vvell considered, vvhether it be not a part of the
apostasie of Antichrist, and such as mainteyneth superstition, & (in some churches) an Idoll and dumbe ministerie, and nourisheth the people still in ignorance of the nature and right use of prayer, &c. D. Raynolds wri∣ting against Bellarmine, hath this general proposition, that to worship God after an unlawfull manner is superstition, asCol. 2, 23 Paul witnesseth, andIn 2a. 2a. quaest. 92. & 93. Aquinas: and su∣perstitious zeale is preposterous, as theRom. 10, 2. Aquin. in Rom. 10, lect. 1. same persons testifie, because it is not ordered by a right knowledge. Rayn. de Rom. Eccles. Idolat. contra Bellarminum. lib. 1, cap. 5. sect. 9. X. If such books of prayer so used, be the leitourgie and worship vvhich the Lord hath appointed, then ought all Churches and people on earth to use that service and maner of vvorship. Mat. 28.20. 1 Tim. 6.13.14. Rev. 22.18.19. And who then shall make such books, for all churches and people in the vvorld? Or who can shevv, that the Primitiue Churches, planted by the Apostles & recorded in the Scriptures, had any such books of prayer prescribed unto them? Or that the Christians in that age did read their prayers out of such books, and so vvorship God? Fynd vve not mention of their prayers divers times recorded? Mat. 14, 28, 30. Luk. 17, 5. Act. 1, 24, 25. and 4, 24 — 30. And doe not the Apostles in their writings, Paul, Iames, Peter, Iohn, and Iude, everie of thē in their Epistles speak of pray∣er, and of the manner & use thereof? yet where doeth any one of them teach the Churches or particular persons to vvhom they write, to read their prayers out of a book, and so to use set formes of prayer devised by men, for their spiritual worship of God, & making their requests known unto him? Let the Scriptures here noted before (in the 7 section) and all their vvritings throughout be searched hereabout. XI. Finally, if such book-prayers be the ordinance of God, and law∣full to be used in such sort, as is aforesaid: then might one man knovve and set downe anothers prayers aforehand; and all men might buy their prayers at the book bynders shops; and carry them in their pockets, and so out of their pockets take their prayers, &c. Whereas right and true spiritual prayer is the work of Gods spirit, in our hearts, stirring, teaching and inabling us to povvre out our soules and prayers unto God in all our necessities and occasions: and so to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Iesus Christ; as is aforesaid. Rom. 8, 15, 26, 27. Ephes. 6, 18. Phi. 4, 6. Jde v. 20. 1 Sam. 1, 12, 15. Zach. 12, 10. 1 Pet. 2, 5. Rev. 8, 3, 4. Divers objections and exceptions made hereabout, I haue treated ofQuaest. de precibus p. 12. &c. otherwhere in particular. To vvhich I refer the Reader: as also to the writings of others heretofore, concerning the same argument. For which see M. Greenvvoods treatise of read prayer, &c. besides the handling of this question, in two epistles, betvveen M. Carp. & my self: p. 11, 12, &c. CHAPTER II. Touching the constitution of particular Churches. VVHether by the ordinance of God, there should be any set ordina∣rie churches novv, but onely particular churches, And vvhether
the constitution of al the particular churches should not be such, as each of them, may ordinarily come together in one place: for the perfor∣mance of the vvorship of God, and all other dueties apperteyning unto them, by the word of God? I. Because the Primitiue churches vvere thus planted and constituted by the Apostles: And this also approved and stablished by Christ our Lord. As may be seen in the seuen Churches of Asia, spoken of in the Re∣velation, Rev. 1, 4, 12, 13, 20. vvith ch. 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. & 3, 1, 7, 14. And in the o∣ther like churches: at Ierusalem, Act. 1, 13, 14, 15. and 6, 2, 5. and 15, 22, 23. and 21, 18, 22. at Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, Act. 14, 21, 23, 27. and 15, 30. at Troas, Act. 20, 7, 8. at Ephesus, Act. 20, 17, 28. Rev. 2, 1. vvith 1 Tim. 1, 3. and 3, 15. and 5, 20. at Rome, Rom. 12, 3 — 8. at Cenchrea, Rom. 16, 1. at Corinth, 1 Cor. 1, 2. and 4, 17. with chap. 5, 4. and 10, 16, 17. and 11, 20, 22, 23. and 12, 18, 19 — 27. and 14, 23, 33, 40. In Galatia, Gal. 1, 2. at Philippi, Phil. 1, 1. at Colosse and Laodicea, Col. 4, 16, 17. at Thessalonica, 1 Thes. 1, 1. vvith ch. 5.12.13.14.27. &c. II. Thus also the particular churches of Christians, are still ansvvera∣ble (in this behalf) to the particular Synagogues of the Iewes, Luke 4, 16, 20, 31, 33. & 7, 5. Act. 13.14.15. and 17.1. and, 18, 4, 7, 8, 27. And as the house where the Iewes met was called a Synagogue, Luke 7, 5. so the Apostle now also calleth the meeting of Christians together, a Synagogue, Jam. 2, 2. Nei∣ther this onely, but seeing novv everie particular constituted church hath right and povver vvithin it self to celebrate the Lords supper, vvhich is answerable to the Passeover, that vvas kept at Ierusalem: this shevveth moreover, that now everie particular church is to be esteemed as Ierusa∣lem: and so to stand immediately under Iesus Christ the Archpastor of his sheep, and the high Priest of our profession. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 23. &c. Act. 2, 42. and 20, 7, 17, 28. compared with Deut. 12, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14. and 16, , 5, 6. 2 Chron. 29. and 30. and 35 ch. Ezra 6, 18, 19. Esa. 66, 19 — 23. Ier. 3, 15, 16, 17. Rev. 21, 1, 2. &c. III. Neyther els can the Pastor of each particular Church stand im∣mediately under Christ the Archpastor: Nor can the Ministers and Elders jointly, & together vvith their flock, sanctify the Lords day, nor feed the Church over vvhich the holy Ghost hath made them Overseers, nor per∣forme any other publick action, with them, unto them, & before them, duly and orderly, vvhether it be the ministration of the vvord, or of the Sacraments, or Censures, or any actions that are publikely & joyntly to∣gether to be performed: according as was done in the Synagogues of the Ievves, and in the primitiue churches. For which see the Scriptures here before alledged, and other the like: as Mark 13, 34 — 37. Luke 4.16 — 20. & 12, 42. Act. 20., 28. Rom. 12.4 — 8. 1 Cor. 4.1. and 14.23.33 — 40. Col. 4.17. 1 Pet. 5.1 — 4. 1 Tim. 5.17.20. Heb. 13.7.8.17. IIII. Nor can they well otherwise know of certaintie, vvhether the members of the Church be present or absent, at their publike meetings, for the vvorship of God, or other dueties there to be performed, that so
they may watch over them, as those that must giue account for them un∣to God. Act. 20.28. Heb. 13.17. 1 Pet. 5.1 — 4. V. Neither can the Churches, or members thereof, be so well in∣structed, governed, and edified, in faith and mutuall loue, as if this order and practise be observed. For which see also the Scriptures aforesaid, and the like. But if the church in any city be more large (as often commeth to passe, and is usuall in great cities) then that it can conveniently and ordinarily meet together in one place: then is it to be considered, whether it should not be distinguished and distributed into divers particular Churches or parishes. Which may everie one of them severally haue their owne pe∣culiar place of meeting together; their owne Pastour, & other ministers, Elders, and Deacons, their ovvn meetings, and all publick actions duly & orderly performed, among themselues, for the reasons here before al∣ledged, and other the like. To vvhich end may also be observed, hovv at Ierusalem (vvhere the great Synedrion of the Iewes was by the Lord ap∣pointed to be, yet notvvithstanding) there vvere, in that one city many Synagogues. And all the Synagogues also had their ovvn rulers & mi∣nisters, as may appeare by such other Synagogues as are particularly spo∣ken of in the Scriptures. Mar. 5, 22. with Luke 4, 16, 20, 31, 33. and 12, 11. and 21 12. with Mat. 10, 17. and 23, 34, Luke 13, 14. vvith Act. 13, 14, 15. and 18, 4, 7, 8, 17. Here moreover (about the estate, and distinction of churches) are two things carefully to be observed; First,As did the seuen chur∣ches of A∣sia, &c. Rev. 1, & 2, and 3 chap. that all particular churches vvith their Pastors (as is noted here before) do stand immediately under Ie∣sus Christ the Archpastour, vvithout any other straunge ecclesiastical power and authoritie interposed betvveen, whether it be of the Prelates, (as of Diocesan Provinciall, or Oecumenicall Bishops;) or of their un∣lawfull usurping Synods, or any such like, invented by men, and brought into the church: Secondly, that notwithstanding the estate & distinction aforesaid, yet, all the churches, and ministers of them, should be alway ready and vvilling, with their mutuall ayde, counsel, assistance and all law∣full maanes, to help, comfort, advise, strengthen, and build up one ano∣ther, in the truth vvhich is according to godlines, in Iesus Christ. Ephes. 4.4 — 16. Rom. 12, 3 — 8. 1 Cor. 12, 4 — 27. Col. 2, 5, 19. and 4, 16, 17. Act. 15, 2 — 23. with Psal. 12 2, 3. Sal. Song. 8, 1. &c.. And so to this end, and in this manner, may be had a lavvfull and pro∣fitable use of Synods, Classes, Assemblies, or Councels, for mutual help & advise, in cases of question, controversie, and difficulties about religion: to as alvvaies it be provided, that they doe not challenge or usurpe any unlavvfull jurisdiction or power over the particular churches, or their pa∣stours and governours, to whom their ovvn povver, under Christ the Lord, is alvvay to be reserved, and to be kept whole and intier, according to the vvord of God. Like as may be seen in all the churches planted by the Apostles: and particularly in those seuen of Asia (standing not farre asunder:) to whom Christ vvrote his several letters, directed to the An∣gels
or Pastors of everie of them in particular: and not to any one of the churches or Pastors more thē another, as having authoritie over the rest; nor to any Diocesan Provinciall or Oecumeniall Bishops set over the churches and Pastors thereof. Which kind of Prelacie, Office & govern∣ment, if it had ben ordeyned by Christ, and planted by the Apostles in those churches: there had novv ben fit and necessarie occasion (specially when Christ vvrote about the corruptions of those churches) both to haue blamed those Bishops for neglect of their duetie (as he doth the An∣gels of the particular Churches) and to haue directed his letters unto them, as being the next & chiefest in ecclesiasticall authoritie under him, to oversee and governe those churches: if then there had ben any such a∣mong them, by the ordinance of Christ. Rev. 2, 1.8.12 18. and 3 1.7 14. com∣pared vvith ch. 1.4.12.13.20. and vvith the estate and constitution of all other churches planted by the Apostles. For vvhich, see the Scriptures here be alledged: pag. 250. And of this also see more hereafter in the fift  here fol∣lovving, If any aske, to whom then the churches shalbe subject, if there be no Diocesan or other like Prelates set over them: I answer, that the churches and all the Officers & members thereof, are to be subject to the Princes, States, and magistrates, under whom they liue: according as the Apo∣stles doe teach us, saying, Let every soul be subject to the higher powers; &c. Re. 13.1. Submit your selues to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the king, as supreme, or unto governours, as unto them that are sent by him, for the pu∣nishment of evill doers, and for the praise of them that doe vvell. 1 Pet. 2, 13, 14. vvith Tit. 3, 1. The magistrates are under the Lord to be the keepers of both the Tables of the Law of God: To whom al persons ought to be subject, euen for conscience sake, & to yeeld obedience unto them: yet alwaies in the Lord, and not against the Lord by any meanes. Deut. 17, 18, 19, 20, Rom. 13, 1 — 7. with Mat. 22, 21. Dan. 3, 14 — 18. Act. 4, 18, 19, 20. Rev. 12, 10, 11. CHAPTER III. Touching the right and power of particular churches. VVHether † everie Church haue not right and power graunted by the Lord, to chuse their ovvn Pastours, & other Ministers, Elders, Deacons, and Deaconesses: making choise of meet & fit persons: as also to * use the ministration of the vvord, Sacraments, Censures, and vvhole ecclesiastical administration; being careful stil to haue al things done, ac∣cording to the ordinance of God, prescribed in his word. Mat. 28, 18 — 20. with  Act 6, 3, 5. and 14, 23. compared with Act. 1, 15, 23, 26. and 2, 41, 42, 46. & 11, 22. & 15, 22, 25. 1 Cor. 16, 3. 2 Cor. 8, 19. Gal. 1, 1. 1 Tim. 3, 1 — 15. & 5, 9, 10, 11, 17, 2. & 6, 13, 14. & Ezec. 33, 2. Lev. 8, 2, 3, 4, 5. Num. 8, 9. Deut. 1, 13 & 16, 18. with Joh. 13, 20. 1 Cor. 4, 1. 2 Cor. 5, 19. Heb. 5, 4. Also * Act. 1, 2, 3, 14, 15. & 15, 2, 6, 23, 30, and 20, 7, 17, 18. & 21, 18 — 23. Rom. 12, 6, 7, 8. & 16, 1, 2. Mat.
18, 17, 18, 19, 20. and 28, 18, 19, 20. 1 Cor. 4, 17. & 5 ch. & 10, 16. and 11, 23 — 26. and 12 ch. Epist. to Timoth. & Tit. Rev. 2, & 3 ch. with 1 Tim. 6, 13, 14. I. Because the Primitiue churches planted by the Apostles, had this right and power at the beginning: as may be seen in the Scriptures here before alledged. II. And the Congregation of Israel had of old likewise their right in the election of their officers, and other such waightie & publike affaires: Which therefore is not novv to be denied unto Christians. Levit. 8, 2 — 5, Deut. 1.13. and 16, 18. and 17, 2 — 7. compared with the Scriptures aforesaid: & par∣ticularly, with 1 Cor. 4, 17. and 5, 13. and 10, 18. &c. And in the Apostles daies, Christians nevvly converted from paganisme, and therefore as unfit and unexpert as men in these times, yet had and used this their right and li∣bertie, as is before shevved. III. Besides that this manner of calling is of speciall waight for the guiding and keeping of the people in obedience to the truth, and in loue and reve of their ministers and other Officers, vvhen they are such as themselues, in dutie to God, and for their ovvn instruction, guiding & service, haue made choise off. For vvhich, compare the Scriptures afore∣said, with 1 Thes. 5, 12, 13. and 1 Tim. 5, 17. IIII. And seeing a true and lawfull calling is necessarie to be had, For othervvise hovv should men be assured that they are called and sent of God? Jer. 17, 16. Amos 7, 15 Heb. 5, 4. Or why doth the Lord account them for intruders & straungers, and severely punish them, vvhich runne being unsent and uncalled, and take upon them that which the Lord hath not laid upon them? Num. 16 ch. and 18, 7. 2 Chron. 26, 16 — 21. Ezec. 44, 9 — 15. Rev. 2.2, campared with Ier. 23, 21. and Joh. 10, 1 — 5. Or hovv els should the people receiue them as from the Lord, ministring and speaking to them in his stead? Ioh. 13, 20. 2 Cor. 5, 19, 20.) Therefore if this be not that man∣ner of entrance which Christ hath ordeyned, eyther some other must be shewed out of the vvord of God appointed by him now to be had; or it must be proved, that now it is lavvfull to devise nevv kinds of election & entrance, or that men may intrude themselues at their owne or other mens pleasure, as they think good. Neyther of vvhich can ever be appro∣ved. V. Here also may be observed, how in other waightie affaires behoo∣full and belonging to the whole bodie of the church, they vvere usually done, in Israell, and the Primitiue Churches, openly vvith the Churches knovvledge, in a publike assemblie, and (as the nature of the cases, and other circumstances required) vvith their consent or approbation having this care, that all should keep their place, and performe their due∣ties, according to the rules prescribed in the vvord of God. Thus they had openly and publikely the vvord ministred, Neh. 8 ch. Jer. 7, and 26 chap. Act. 13, 14, 15. and 15, 21. and 20, 28. 1 Cor. 14, 23, 24. 1 Tim 1, 3. and 3, 15. and 4.13. the Passeover, and the Lords supper celebrated, 2 Chron. 30. and 35 ch. r. 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 18, 20. &c. the punishments, and censures on sin∣ners
and malefactors inflicted. Deut. 17, 2 — 13. & 21, 18 — 21. Ioh. 16, 2. 1 Cor. 5, 3, 4, 5, 13. 1 Tim. 5, 20. The Elders in Israell sate and judged in the gates, vvhere the people did and might come: Deut. 21, 18 — 21. & 22, 13-21. & 25.5 — 10. with Ruth. 4.1 — 11. And afterward vvhen they lived under the Ro∣manes, or out of their owne countrey, they sate & judged in their coun∣cels, or houses of judgement; and inflicted punishment in their Syna∣gogues. Mat. 10, 17. and 23, 32. Luk. 6, 22. and 21.12. Joh. 9, 22. and 12, 42. Act. 23, 1 — 7. and 24, 20, 21. The children of Israell on this side Iorden, heare, and send to the children of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, about the Altar vvhich they set up, in the borders of Iordan, Josh. 22.11 — 33. The people were assembled, when reformation of strange mariages, was to be made. Ezra 10 ch. Praise is giuen to God, in the congregation of the people, and assemblie of the Elders, Psal. 137.32. The high Priest and the Elders of the nation, and the Priests and the other people of the Iewes, send letters to the Lacedemonians. 1 Mach. 12, 6. Lysias also and king Antiochus send letters to the Counsell, and the rest of the Ievves, 2 Mach. 11, 16, 27. Iona∣than calleth the Elders of the people together, and consulteth with them about building strong holds in Iudea: vvhereupon the people come to∣gether to build up the citie, &c. 1 Mach. 12, 35, 36.37. Likevvise in the pri∣mitiue churches, and vvhiles the Apostles lived, the church sendeth forth some for the further instructiō or building up of others in the faith. Act. 11.22. and 15.22.25.27. Publike controversies in religion, are publikely heard, disputed, and determined. Act. 11, 2 — 18. and 15.2 — 22. vvith 16.4. and 17.1.2.3. and 21.18 — 22 — 25. Publike sinners are openly rebuked before a and delivered to Sathan, when the church is gathered together. 1 Tim. 5.20. 1 Cor. 5.3.4.5.11.12.13. compared vvith Deut. 17.2 — 7. Generall letters a∣bout publike affaires and occasions, are written by the Apostles, Elders, and brethren. Act. 15.23. Gal. 1.1.2. 1 Cor. 16.3. They that are sent with let∣ters or benevolence or upon other such occasions from one church to a∣nother, are chosen or approved of the churches. Act. 15.2.22.23. 1 Cor. 16.. and 2 Cor. 8.19. In vvhich severall cases, and the like (although some diffe∣rences may be observed whereupon novv I insist not: as namely that some of them are done vvith election according to the suffrages & voy∣ces of the people, or other approbation, some vvay signified; others or them are decreed by the Elders, & publikly denounced or executed, &c. yet notwithstanding) this point & the manner of dealing aforesaid is duly and carefully to be regarded: And that the more, inasmuch as in those times there were besides the Elders of the people, the Prophets & Priests in Israell, the Apostles and Ministers in the Primitiue churches, who (if a∣ny at al) might haue excluded the people in such cases, or kept from them the knovvledge thereof, if it had ben lavvfull so to doe: specially seeing they had the Elders of the churches then present and consenting vvith them. Which yet they would not doe, though they vvere the messengers of the Lord of hostes, the Prophets and Apostles of Christ, the builders & Maister-builders in the framing, guyding, & establishing of the churches
in the vvay and order appointed by the Lord. But now vvhat they might or vvould haue done, if the people vvere refractarie, or took to much up∣on them, or were divided into parts and factions, and vvould not con∣sent nor rest, or be obedient, as they should: that is another question, vvhich here I treat not off. Numb. 16 ch. 2 Chron. 26.16 — 20. Ier. 26.8 — 24. Act. 20.17.28. 1 Cor. 4.21. and 11.18. &c. 2 Cor. 12.20.21. and 13.1.2.8. 1 Tim. 1.20. and 5.17.19.20.21. and 6.13.14. Tit. 2.15. Rev. 2.14.20. &c. VI. Moreover, not onely the Catholick, but also everie particular Church (in a right and due consideration) is the church and city of God, the body of Christ, the kingdome of God, the ground and pillar of truth, the house of the living God, &c. Psa. 87, 3. Rev. 21, 2. &c. Mat. 5.14.22. & 10, 17. & 13.24. & 18.15 — 20. 1 Cor. 5, 13. with Deu. 17.2.7. & 21.18 — 21.

The Spirit of God hath spoken alike to all the seuen Churches, and to each of the Angels thereof, and all that haue eares to heare, are vvilled to hearken what the Lord saith. Rev, 1, 4.11. and 2, & 3 chap. Mat. 13.43. VII. The Prophets also foretold, that under the Gospel everie place of Mount Sion, and the assemblies thereof, should haue the like gracious presence, light, glorie, and protection of God, as Israel had when the Lord brought them out of the land of Egypt. Esa. 4, 2, 4, 5. with Exod. 13, 21. VIII. Finally; Churches els should not haue povver from Christ (in time of persecution, or after the apostasie of Antichrist) to reteine, reviue, and obserue the Apostolike ordinances, once (for all) delivered to the Church. Which were contrarie to Mat. 28.18.19.20. Act. 5.28.29. Phil. 1.1.28.29.30. Col. 2.5. 1 Thes. 3, 2.3. 2 Thes. 2.3 — 15. 1 Tim. 6.13.14. Iude v. 3.

VVHether it lye not upon the Pastors and all others that beare of∣fice in the church of God, to fulfill their Ministerie, and to per∣forme al things perteining to their office, according to the word of God: And not according to the Statutes or Edicts of Princes and States; the Canons of Prelates; the Constitutions of Synods; the pleasure or voyces of the people; or any other vvay invented or obtruded upon them by men. 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2. Col. 4, 17. Act. 20, 17 — 24 — 32. vvith 13, 24, 25. Rom. 12, 7, 8. 1 Thes. 5, 12, 13, 14. 1 Pet. 5, 1 — 4. with Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. and 6, 24. The Epistles to Timothee, and Titus. Heb. 3, 1, 2, 3. and 13, 7, 17. Ioh. 15, 14, 15, 16. Gal. 1, 8, 9, 10. Rev. 2, and 3, and 14, 4, 6, 9, 12. compared with Lev. 10, 1, 2, 3. Deut. 4, 2. & 12, 32. & 33, 8 — 11. 2 Sam. 6, 6, 7. 2 Chron. 26, 16 — 21. 1 King. 22.13, 14. Psal. 19.7, 8, 9. and 119. and 132.9.16. Prov. 30, 5, 6. Esa. 8, 11 — 20. and 33.22. and 55, 4.

Because the Pastors and ministers of the church are by Christ giuen to the church for the vvork of the ministerie, and are by their office the household stevvards and dispensers of the mysteries of God. And it is re∣quired in stewards, that a man be found faithful. Eph. 4, 11, 12, 13. 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2. Luk. 12 42 — 48. and 19.12 — 26. 1 Tim. 3, 15. and 5, 17 — 21. 2 Cor. 5, 20. Col. 4, 17. II. And Christs commission, and charge which he hath straitly giuen to his Ministers, is, to teach and obserue al things whatsoever he hath cō∣manded them, & neither to adde thereunto, nor to diminish therefrom: but to keep this his commandement vvithout spot and unrebukeable, un∣till that his glorious appearing. To which commandement also he hath annexed a promise of assistance and blessing, to such as shal be syncere & faithfull herein; and a denunciation of judgment and curse upon such as are unfaithfull and disobedient hereunto. Mat. 28.20. 1 Tim. 6.13.14. Ezec. 2.6.7.9. and 3.10.11.17. &c. Mat 25.14 — 30. Col. 4.17. 1 Tim. 5.17. Rev. 2. and 3 ch. and 22.18.19. III. The ministers of Christ must therefore euen unto kings & prin∣ces, to Priests and people, to high and low, of all estates and conditions, make knovvne the will of God, shevv them their sinnes, denounce Gods judgments against them, and in all things fulfill and execute all the due∣ties of their office and functions, as there is need, and just occasion. So far ought they to be, from performing their ministerie, and dueties of their calling, according to the prescription or pleasure of man: but one∣ly according to the will and word of God. And that so, as we ought not to be moved with any afflictions or troubles in this behalf, neyther to count our liues deare unto us, so as vve may finish our course with joy, & the ministerie vvhich vve haue received of the Lord Iesus, to testifie the Gospell of the grace of God: not shunning to declare the whole counsel of God, that we may be pure from the blood of all men. Ier. 1.17.18.19. Ezech. 3.16 — 21, Hos. 5.1. 1 Sam. 15.13 — 23. 2 Sam. 12.1 — 14. 1 King. 18.17.18. and 21.17 — 24. 2 Chron. 26.16 — 20. with Deut. 33.8 — 11. Mat. 10.16.17.18.28.32. 33.37 — 39. and 14.3.4. and 23.13 — 39. Act. 9.15.16. and 20.24 — 28. 1 Tim. 1, 3.. and 5.1.2.20.21. and 6.13.14.17. 2 Tim. 4.1 — 5. Tit. 2.15. Rev. 2, and 3 ch. and 12. 8 — 11. &c. And if all that vvill follovv Christ, must cast their account what it will stand them in so to doe, & must neither loue father nor mo∣ther, wife nor children, brethren nor sisters, lands nor goods, no nor their ovvne life, in this behalf; but must be content to leaue and forsake all, if they vvill be Christs disciples: how much more should the Ministers of Christ be carefull hereof, who are to be guides & examples to the flock, of all godlines, pacience, and faithfulnes to the end? Luk. 14, 26 — 33. & 18.18 — 30. with 1 Tim. 4.12 — 16. 2 Tim. 2.1.2, 3. and 3.10— 12. and 4.5.7.16.17.18. 1 Pet. 5.1 — 4. Rev. 2.8 — 11. IIII. And herein vve haue the examples of the godly ministers and servants of God in all ages; who being faithfull to God, and performing
the dueties of their calling according to his vvord, received comfort, strength, and blessing from the Lord, in the midst of all the opposition made against them by any meanes. 1 King. 22, 13 — 28. 2 Chron. 16, 7 — 10. & 24.17 — 22. and 25, 14.15, 16. and 26, 17 — 20. Ezra 9. and 10 ch. Esa. 8, 11 — 20. and 50, 4 — 9. Ier. 15, 10-21. and 26, 8 — 24. and 37, 6 — 21. and 38, ch. and 39, 11, 12 — 14. and 40, 1 — 6. Micah 3, 8 — 12. Zach. 3 ch. Act. 4. and 5, and 12, and 16. ch. &c. 2 Tim. 4, 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18. Rev. 2, 7, 10, 13. and 7, 7, 10, 11, 12. and 17, 14. For vvhich also see the histories of the Martyrs. Besides the contrarie examples of such, as being not careful, or faithful to God in his seruice, to minister according to his word, haue had heavie judgements come upon them. Which also are written, for instruction and example to all others. Lev. 10, 1, 2, 3 Num. 16 ch. 1 Sam. 2, 13-36. & 3, & 4 ch. 2 Sam. 6, 6, 7. 1 King. 13 chap. Jer. 28, and 29 ch.

And memorable is the example of Saul (though a king) who doing that vvhich pleased the people, and seemed good in his own eyes, contrarie to the word of God: is therefore sharply reproved by Samuell the Prophet, and severely pu∣nished by the Lord. 1 Sam. 15, 13 — 24. V. Moreover, the Scriptures alone are sufficient, for the direction of the Pastours and other officers administration: being giuen by inspirati∣on of God, and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, & for instructiō in righteousnes, that the man of God may be perfit, & through∣ly furnished to everie good work. 2 Tim. 3, 15, 16. Psa. 19, 7, 8, 9. And Christ himself (vvho alone is the head and Lavvgiver of his church) hath left sufficient direction in his vvord, both for the faith, and for the order of his church. Neither may any men vvhosoever super ordeyn to his Testa∣ment, nor any vvay disanull it, or adde thereunto. Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. Ephes. 1, 22, 23. Col. 2, 2 — 23. Esa. 33, 22. Heb. 3, 1, 2, 3. and 12, 25 — 29. with Gal. 3, 15. and Rev. 22, 18, 19. VI. Otherwise the Pastors and other Officers of the Church should sinne not onely against God, but also against themselues, and against the Princes, Prelates, and people whomsoever, whose prescription & pleasure they should so follovv. And that both in making them to be the Lords of our religion, and in corrupting them, or suffering them to be corrupted by themselues and others, in religion and conversation, and so to be in continual daunger to be seduced and dravven into errors, heresies, super∣stititions, and iniquities, &c. Whereas the Ministers & Officers of Christ should in all things be careful so to walk, as they may be meanes and in∣struments (under God) to bring them to the obedience of Christ in this life, and to eternall salvation by him in the life to come. Ezec. 3, 16 — 21. & 33, 1 — 9. Mark 8, 34-38. 1 Sam. 2, 12 — 36. and 4 chap. 2 King. 16, 10— 16. vvith 2 Chron. 28, 23. Dan. 6, 10— 22. Psal. 2, 10, 11, 12. and 132, 9, 16.

Neyther should they els be blamed (as they are for the neglect hereof, if it vvere not their duetie, & in the povver of their office, to per¦forme
and fulfill it in the Lord. Rev. 2, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20. &c. with 1 Sam. 3, 13, 14. and 2, 12 — 36. Ezech. 13, and 33, and 34 ch. Hos. 4, 6, 8, 9.

Els also the ministers and other Officers of the church, should not now at this time be as straitly bound to be faithfull to the Lord in their functions and in the ministration thereof,Heb. 3, 1, 2, 3. & 13, 7, 8, 17. with Deu. 33, 8, 9.12. Mal. 1, 6 — 14. and 2, 7. as were the Priests and other Officers of Israel heretofore: Nor as vvereAct. 20, 17, 28 — 32. Cal. 4, 17. 1 Tim. 6, 13, 14. 1 Pet. 1, 1 — 4. Rev. 2, and 3 chap. the ministers & other officers in the Primitiue churches, vvhiles the Apostles lived. Which is contrarie to the Scriptures, IX. Lastly, they could not els discharge the dueties which God hath laid upon them, so as to giue account thereof, vvith comfort, to God, at that day: vvhen the Lord vvill graciously revvard all such as haue ben faithfull unto him, and severely punish them that haue dealt unfaithfully in his service and work, committed unto them. Mat. 25, 14 — 30. 2 Cor. 5.9, 10, 11. 2 Tim. 4, 1, 2. Heb. 13, 17. 1 Pet. 5, 1-4. Dan. 12, 3. Rev. 2, 10 & 22.16-20. Chrysostome speaking to those that ministred the communion, saith, No small punishment hangeth over you, if knowing any man to be wicked, you suffer him to be partaker of this Table. His blood shalbe required at your hands. If he be a Ca∣ptain, a Consul, or a crowned King that commeth unworthily, forbid him, and keepe him off: thy power is greater then his. And againe, I will yeeld my life rather, then the Lords body to any unworthy person; and suffer my blood to be shed, before I will grace that sacred blood to any, but to him that is worthy. Chrysost. homil. 83. in Mat 26. Many the like things about the Sacraments and censures, might be shew∣ed out of the auncient writers. But to let them alone: the Scripture is evident and undeniable, that Iehojadah the Priest set porters at the gates of the Lords house, that none vvhich vvas uncleane in any thing, should enter in. 2 Chron. 23, 19. Also, that Azariah the chief Priest, and the other Priests with him, vvould not suffer Vzziah the king of Iudah to burne in∣cense to the Lord; yea and vvhen he was stricken vvith leprosie, thrust him out of the Temple, 2 Chron. 26, 16 — 20. Thus the Apostle likewise chargeth Timothee before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that he obserue the things prescribed in that Epistle, without prefer∣ring one before another, and vvithout partialitie. 1 Tim. 5.21. And that he should keep this commandement without spot and unrebukeable, un∣till the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Tim. 6, 13, 14. Which Timmothee could not doe in his owne person, being but to serue his time, and then to depart out of this life: but thus the Apostle taught, that those cōman∣dements vvere prescribed, not for him onely, but for those also that should succeed afterward in the ministerie & government of the church, untill the appearing of Christ our Lord, euen to the ende of the world. Which yet further appeareth, in that Christ doeth so plainly and particu∣larly blame the Angels and Pastors of the Churches in Asia, because they uffered false teachers and corrupt livers in the churches, and did not restreine and
represse them, as they ought to haue done, according to the duetie and power of the office laid upon them by the Lord. Rev. 2, 14, 20, &c. with Act. 20, 17, 28 — 30. 1 Tim. 1, 3. and 5, 17 — 25. and 6, 13, 14. Tit. 2, 15. But of these things I haue spoken before, and shall haue occasion hereafter to note some∣what more againe thereabout. CHAPTER V. Touching the distinction of the Pastors and Teachers offices. VVHether vve should not (inI speak not here, of Schooles or Vniversities in particu∣lar, the church) put difference betvveen the Pastors and Teachers offices. I. Because the Pastors and Teachers now in the church, are ansvve∣rable to the Priests andThe Levi∣ticall teach∣ers. Levites in Israell, for sundry things of perpetual equitie and moralitie: and are sometimes by the Prophets accordingly styled and signified by their names. Esa. 66, 21. compared with Ephes. 4, 11, 12. Rom. 12, 7, 8. & 15, 16. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14. And al acknowledge that the Priests and Levites had not the same peculiar office and function, nor the same or like equall authoritie in the church of Israel, and in the administration of the holy things of God. Num. 16, 8, 9, 10, 40. and 18, 1, 2, 3. vvith 3, & 4 chap. 2 Chron. 29, 16, 34. II. Secondly, the Offices of the Pastors and Teachers, are themselues divers functions, giuen to the church by Christ the Lord; and according∣ly had in the Primitiue churches. Eph. 4, 11. 1 Cor. 12, 5, 8. with Rom. 12, 7, 8. Object. But the Apostle in Ephes. 4, 11. seemeth rather to joyne them to∣gether as one, by the conjunction copulatiue KAI, And: then to distin∣guish them, as being severall, the one from the other. Answ. This conjunction also is sometimes used for a discretiue, in di∣visions, and in the shutting up of distributions. As the same Apostle useth it otherwhere Gal. 3, 8. when he saith, There is neither Jew, nor Greek, there is neither bod nor free, there is neither male nor female, &c. vvhere vvord for word it is, neither male and female: But [and] is used here distributiuely: and so is understood and translated, neither male nor female, according to the distribu∣tions used before in the same sentence. And thus in the place to the E∣phesians, the Syriack translation (vvhich is most auncient) useth a distri∣butiue particle: distinguishing asvvell between Pastors and Teachers, as between Apostles, Prophets, and Euangelists. Ephe. 4, 11, in Syri. translat. Not to speak of the Hebrew conjunction VAU, And: which the Scripture also oftē useth for a discretiue, as in Exo. 21, 15, 17. Deu. 17, 9, 12. Besides that the like maner of speach is used, in Gen. 1.14. and Hos. 3, 4. &c. III. Thirdly, the holy Ghost (bestowing the gifts of God, and divi∣ding them to every man severally, as he vvill distributeth divers & di∣stinct gifts unto men, for the performance of the dueties of these offices aforesaid. 1 Cor. 12, 4, 8, 11. IIII. Fourthly, God worketh diversly by these offices and gifts, be∣stowed
on his church. 1 Cor. 12, 6, 7, 11, 18, &c. V. And Christ the Lord, layeth divers vvorks and administrations up∣on these offices and ministers themselues: besides the duties that are cō∣mon to them both. viz. Vpon the Pastors, that they should in their ministe∣rie more particularly use the speach of vvisedome, & together vvith do∣ctrine exhort, rebuke, comfort, and vvisely apply the vvord of God (as there is occasion) to the divers uses, necessities, and conditions of the church and people; that they should also administer the Sacraments and seales of Gods grace annexed to his word and promise; execute the cen∣sures and sanctions of his vvord and judgments; and alvvaies stirre up al, of all sorts, to godlines, righteousnes, and sobrietie; and defend the truth of God against all adversaries; and finally to governe the Church in all things (according to the duetie of their calling) carefully, vvisely, and faithfully, under Iesus Christ, the Lord and Archpastor of his church and people. 1 Cor. 12, 5, 8. with Rom. 12, 8. Ephes. 4, 11, 12. with Esa 66, 21. 2 Chro. 13.10, 11. and 15, 3. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 21. and 11, 23 — 26. with Mat. 26, 26, 27, 28. & Eze. 44, 15, 16, 23, 24. Lev. 10, 9, 10. Num. 6, 23 — 27. Joh. 20, 19 — 23. with Mat. 16, 19. and 23, 34. and 24, 45. and 28, 18, 19, 20. Epist. to Timoth. and Titus. Heb, 13, 7, 17.  Pet. 5, 1 — 4. Rev. 1, 12, 13, 16, 20. and 2, 1. &c. All vvhich things may well be included and comprised in the verie name of a Pastor. Which is the more to be observed, both for the similitude of the Shepheards, whence it is taken; and because the names of Offices used in the Scripture, doe fitly note out the nature & dueties of the Offices themselues, sometimes in one respect, sometimes in another. Vpon the Teachers also the Lord hath laid, that they should in their mi∣nisterie specially use the speach of knovvledge, and instruct the Church out of the vvord of God; interpreting the Scriptures, teaching the know∣ledge of the truth, vvhich is according to godlines, catechizing the peo∣ple, elder and younger (as there is occasion) confuting errours, convin∣cing adversaries, & performing all those things that more specially per∣teyne to the delivering and defending of the doctrine of God faithfully and syncerely, under Christ the great Prophet and Teacher of his church and people. 1 Cor. 12, 5, 8, 28, 29. with Rom. 12, 7. Eph. 4, 11, 12. with Esa. 66, 21. and 30, 20. Neh. 8, 8, 9. Deut. 33, 8, 10. vvith Num. 16, 8, 9, 10. Gal. 6, 6. Prov. 22, 6, 20, 21. Esa 28, 9, 12. Heb. 5, 12. and 6, 1, 2. Matth. 13, 52. and 23, 34. Luke 2, 46. and 4, 16 — 24. and 5, 17. and 13, 33. vvith Deut. 18, 15 — 22. Act. 5, 34. and 8, 30.31 — 35. and 13.1. and 15, 35. 1 Tim. 1, 3, 4, 7. and 2, 7. and 3, 2. and 5, 17. 2 Tim. 1, 11, 13. and 4, 1, 2, 3. Tit. 1, 5, 9. &c. And these things may vvel be implied in the name of a Teacher. But whether more is to be required of them as they are Teachers, may further be considered. As also that of old in the Church of Israell they might haue Teachers, vvho vvere not Sacrificers: and vvhether likewise they might not haue Teachers, that were not Rulers or governours among they unles they vvere also chosen to government besides. Deut 33.8, 10. Neh 8, 8, 9. vvith Numb. 16, 8, 9, 10. and 18, 1 — 7. 1 Chron. 6, 48, 49. Amo , 12 — 15. Mat.
13, 52. and 23, 34. Luke 2, 46. and 5, 17. compared with 2 Chron. 17, 7, 8, 9. Iohn 3, 1, 10. and Act. 5, 34. Finally, for the distinction betvveen the Pastors & Teachers office, ob∣serue hovv Ambrose, repeating the place of Ephes. 4, 11. saith thereon: I doe neither challenge the glorie of the Apostles; for who will doe that, but those whom the me of God himself chose? nor the grace of the Prophets, nor the vertue of the Euangelists, nor the circumspection of the Pastors; but I desire onely to obteyne intension and diligence a∣bout the divine Scriptures: which the Apostles placed last among the offices of the Saints: and n this that studying to teach, I may learne, Ambros. off. l. 1. c. 1. For which also see, Grego∣re Nazianzen de mod. And, Ierome, who likewise distinguish the Pastor & Doctor, Eph. 4, 11. And among the later Writers, Calvin in his Institutions treating of the ministers of the church, and on Ephes. 4.11. after he hath spoken of the Apostles, Prophets, Euangelists, comming to speak of the Pastors & Tea∣chers, saith thus: There followe the Pastors and Teachers, whom the church can never want: among whom there is this difference, that the Teachers are not set over the discipline, nor the administration of the Sacraments, nor admonitions or exhortations; but over the interpretation of the Scripture, that the doctrine may be kept syncere and sound among the faithfull. But the Pastors office conteyneth all these things in it. Calvin. Institut. lib. 4. cap. 3. sect. 4. And a litle after, comparing together those functions that are spo∣ken off, Eph. 4, 11. he saith: As the Teachers are ansvverable to the aun∣cient Prophets there spoen off) so are the Pastors to the Apostles: except that these haue their certain peculiar churches assigned unto them. Ibid. sect. 5. Piscator also hath the like: vvho first noteth this, that the Lord at the beginning of his kingdome raised up Apostles, Prophets, and Euangelists: by whom when the Churches were founded and planted, he appointed in their place Teachers and Pastors perpetu∣ally to endure: And then putteth the same difference between these Offices, and in the same words, as Calvin doth here before. Piscat. Aphorism. cap. 20. sect, 8. and 12. Beza like wise in his Annotations on Rom. 12, 7. making this difference betvveen them, noteth it thus: The Apostle calleth him a Teacher, who in the church attendeth onely to the simple interpretation of the Scripture, that the doctrine may be kept pure and syncere. And the Exhorter, who otherwhere is termed a Pastor, he calleth him at yneth doctrine together with admonitions and exhortations, & also with the administra∣tion of the Sacraments. Beza in Rom. 12, 7. Vrsinus noteth the same difference betvveene these Offices. Vrsin. Catec. part. 3. writing on the fourth Commandement:  the Ministerie, quest. 2. So doth M. Fenner also in his Theologie, vvhere he vvriteth thus: The Teachers are they, which are imployed privately and publikely, in delivering of doctrine faith∣ touching all dueties both common and proper. Nehem. 8.9. Luke 5, 17. Rom. 12, . 1 C 12 8. The Pastors, are they which are imployed in applying the word with wisedome to al duties  proper and common. Rom. 12, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 8. Wherefore besides exhortations, there is required of him that in his publike office, he apply the truth to the hearts of men, by the admini∣stration of the seales. Lev. 10.9.10 2 Chron. 13, 10. Rom, 12, 5 — 8. Ephes. 4, 11. Fenne. The. lib. 7. cap. 7. Divers others haue written in like sort hereabout: which I leaue to the observation of the Reader. CHAPTER VI. Of the having of one or moe Pastours, in particular Churches. Also of Diocesan and Provinciall Bishops, &c. VVHether it be not most according to the ordinance of God, that in everie particular church, there beRev. 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3 1, 7, 14. and 22, 16-19. vvith Phil. 4, 3. Col. 4, 16, 17. & Act. 21, 18. Luc. 12, 42. 1 Tim. 1, 3. and 3, 15. & 5, 19 — 22. and 6, 13, 14. one Pastor or Angel of the
church (so properly and specially called) and † divers teachers and ruling Elders (according to the condition of the church) joyned to the Pastor, in the ministerie and government of the same church: who may all of them also generally be called Pastors: yet so, as one be specially distin∣guished from the rest, in respect of his place & function, to be the Pastor  more particularly called) under Iesus Christ the Archpastor. Or, whe∣ther there being many Elders appointed to feed, instruct, & governe the Church, they should be all alike, or of one sort, vvithout any distinction of Office or function among them. Where touching the first point, these things, and the like may be consi∣dered. I. The constitution of the Primitiue churches, as they were esta∣blished by the Apostles. As namely, the churches of Ephesus, Smyrna, Co∣losse, Laodicea, &c. Rev. 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7, 14. and 22, 16-19. vvith Phil. 4, 3. Col. 4, 16, 17. & Act. 21, 18. Luc. 12, 42. 1 Tim. 1, 3. and 3, 15. & 5, 19 — 22. and 6, 13, 14. † Act. 20, 17, 28. compared vvith Rev. 2, 1. and Ephes. 4, 11, 12. & 1 Tim. 1, 3. and 3, 1 — 15. and 5, 17, 19, 21. Act. 11.30. and 13.1. and 14.23. and 15.2.6.22.23.35. and 16.4. and 21.18. Rom. 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.5.8.28. Phil. 1. 1. Col. 1.7. and 4.12.17. 1 Thes. 5.12.13.14.27. Tit. 1.5 — 9. Heb. 13.7.17.24. Iam. 5.14. 1 Pet. 5.1 — 4. And divers things also hereabout, may be noted in the auncient vvriters, who lived a while after the Apostles dayes: This being stil care∣fully observed vvithall (because the mysterie of iniquitie began to vvork, euen in the Apostles time, and the apostasie of Antichrist spread abroad aftervvard more and more) that we insist no further nor otherwise upon those Writers, in any points of religion, but as they agree with the Scri∣ptures, and in such things as are grounded thereupon. Now therefore concerning the point in hand: Ignatius hath often in his Epistles, to the Churches to which he wrote, these & the like sayings▪ Let all things be done of you, according to good order in Christ. Let the laymen (or people) be subject to the Deacons, the Deacons to the Elders, the Elders to the Bishop the Bishop to Christ, as he to his Father. And again, What is the Eldership, but an ∣ly Senate, the Counsellors and assistants of the Bishops? Ignat. epist. ad Smyrn. ad T∣lenses, ad Antiochenos. & 3. ad Magnesios, &c. And Iustine Martyr calleth him TON PROESTOTA, the president or chief go∣vernour, whom Ignatius, Irenaeus, Eusebius, and others call EPISCOPON, the Bishop, or Overseer: so applying generall termes, to this office more parti∣cularly. Iustin. Martyr. Apolog. 2. Irenaeus writeth of Polycarpus by name, that he was made Bishop by the Apostles, in Asia, in the church of Smyrna. And that himself had seen him, vvhen he was young. Irenaeus, libr. 3. cap. 3. He also nameth sundry of the Bishops of the Church of Rome, who succeeded one after another in that church, from the Apostles times, to his ovvne dayes. Ibid. Eusebius writeth likevvise of Polycarpus, made Bishop of the church of Smyrna by the Apostles (Euseb. l. 3. c. 32. and l. 4. c. 14.) and of many Bishops by name, who follovved one another in the church of Rome, and in sun∣dry other churches, after the Apostles & Euangelists: vvhich were long
here to recite in particular. Euseb. lib. 3. c. 2.13.14.19.31.32. and lib 4. c. 1.4 5.10.19.22.23. &c. Onely note these, for some special instances hereabout; In the church of Alexandria, Anianus; and after him, Abilius, &c. Euseb. l. 2 24. & 3.13. In the church of Ierusalem, Simeon (after Iames the Apo∣stle & after him, Iustus, &c. Ibid. l. 3. c. 11. &. 32. In the church of Antioch, ; and after him, Ignatius, &c. Ibid. l. 3. c. 19. In the church of Corinth, ; and after him, Dionysius, &c Ibid. l. 4. c. 21. & 22. In the church of A∣thens, Dionysius Areopagites; & after him, Quadratus Publius, &c. Ibid. Where also obserue, hovv Eusebius sometimes calleth the churches, parishes: As, the parish of Alexandria, the parish of Ephesus, the parish of Ierusalem, the parish of Hierapolis, the parish of Athens,Of other in∣terpretation or applica∣tion of the word [pa∣rish] I will not now in∣sist nor of the  &c. vvhereof such & such (there named) were Bishops or Overseers, one after another. Euseb. l. 2. c. 24. &  3. c. 4 11.28.32. & l. 4. c. 1.4.5.19.22. Which is vvel to be noted for better observation, how every church or parish had at the beginning their own Pastor or Bishop; and hovv those Bishops were much unlike the Dioce∣san, Provinciall, and Oecumenicall Bishops, had now a dayes: who con∣tent not themselues with a parish or particular Church, but chalendge (by vertue of such office) authoritie over whole Dioceses, Provinces, and the universall vvorld: as in the apostasie of Antichrist may be seen. And thus much by the way, concerning the testimonie of the auncient writers in this behalf. Which I leaue to be examined by the Scriptures, as is a∣foresaid. II. Secondly, vvhere the order is observed, vvhich is mentioned in the question here before, there may the difference be kept both between the Pastors and Teachers offices; and betvveen the offices of the Teach∣ing and ruling Elders. Ephes. 4, 11, 12. and 1 Tim. 5.17. vvith Rev. 2.1. and Rom. 12.3 — 8. 1 Cor. 12.5.8.28. &c. Which othervvise is either unknovven of many, and so neglected; or els is confusedly caried, and corrupted, sun∣drie vvaies. III. A particular visible church may (in the outward constitutiō there of) be considered, as a particular visible body. Now a particular visible body, hath a particular visible head. Which also is such, as cannot say to the feete or inferiour members, I haue no need of you. 1 Cor. 12.18 — 21. vvith Ea. 1, 5, 6. and Rom. 12.3 — 8. Col. 2.5. and 4.17. Rev. 2.1.8. &c. and vvith the Epi∣stles to Timothee and Titus. And touching the vvord (head) thus taken and used in the Scripture, (for some chief member or members, governor or governors, or any persons and things, vvhich excell or are before others, in dignitie, office, age, au∣thoritie, time, place, or any speciall excellencie:) see Exod. 6, 14. & 30.23. Numb. 1.3 4.16. and 7.2. Deut. 20.9. and 28.13.44. Iosh. 23.2. and 2, 1. 1 Sam. 15, 17. 2 Sam. 23, 8, 13, 18. 1 Chron 9.10— 13. and 24, 4, 6, 31. Neh. 11, 16. & 12.7, 12, 22, 23, 24. Esa. 1, 5, 6. and 7, 8. and 9, 14, 15. and 29, 10. Ezec. 21, 26. and , 2, and 40, 1. Mic. 3, 3, 9, 11. Ier. 13, 21. 1 Cor. 12, 21. And note, that here I speak onely of particular churches, as they are organicall, and set in an orderly visible constitution: and so of the out∣vvard
order, and divers functions set in the church by the Lord himself: and that I speak not of the church, as it is the mysticall body of Christ; nor of the spirituall and quickning head of the church, & of all the mem∣bers thereof wheresoever. Which is Christ alone: and unto whom alone this apperteyneth, and to none other vvhosoever besides. Eph. 1.22.23. & 4, 15, 16. and 5.23. Col. 1.18. and 2.19. 1 Cor. 12.12. compared vvith Jer. 33.16. Note also hovv both auncient and later vvriters doe thus use the same word, and likewise apply it. Chrysostome speaking of the returne of the Bishop, vvhen himself was an Elder at Antioch, saith, Blessed be God, that hath restored the head to the body, the Pastor to the sheep, &c. Chrysost. homil. 20. ad populum Antiochenum. Basil vvriting to the church of Neocaesarea, upon the death of their Bishop, saith, The church closeth her eyes, the solemne assemblies look heavily, the sacred Synedrion (Presbytery or Eldership) desire their head; they that are in dignitie their leader, the people their ruler. Basil. epist. 62. ad Eccles Neocasarien Among later vvriters, D. Raynolds conferring with Hart, saith: We teach thatApolog. Eccl. Ang. confes. Hel∣vet. c. 17. Christ is the head of the church, as he doth quicken it vvith his spirit, as he is the light, the health, the life of it: and is present alvvaies to fill it vvith his blessings, and vvith his grace to governe it. In the vvhich respects, becauseEphes. 1.22. and 4.15. and 5.23. Col. 1.18. and 2.19, and so the church his body. the Scripture giveth the name of head to Christ alone, by an excellencie: thereof we so conclude, that he is the onely head of the church. For othervvise, vve knovv, that (in another kind and degree of resemblance) they may be called heads, who haue anie preeminence of place or government over others. As in the Hebrevv text we readNehem- 11.16. the heads of the Le∣vites, for the chief of them: &,2 Chro. 31 10. the Priest the head, that is to say, the chief Priest. After the which sort, I wil not contend, if you entitle Bishops heads of the churches, asIn Apo∣log. 2. Athanasius doth; &In Regist. lib. 4. epist. 38. Gregorie, vvhen he had named our Saviour Christ, the head of the universall church, he calleth Christs Ministers, as it vvere heads: Paul, Andrevv, Iohn, heads of particular flocks, yet members of the church, & under one head. Rayn conference with Hart. chap. 1, Divis. 2. pag. 20. And M. Iacob in his Attestation vvriteth thus hereabout: M. Gabr. Powel maketh it an heresie in the Pope, to hold as he doth, that in the visible church there ought to be a visible head. What doe I heare? A visible Body instituted by Christ with∣out a visible head? A church and no Pastor? A multitude to be governed, and no Go∣vernour? These are straunge assertions, whosoever, and hovv many soever doe affirme them. For I graunt there are not a few others vvhich use so to speak. But indeed there is no colour of truth, nor reason in these sayings. M. Iacobs Attestat. ch. 7. p. 113. And a litle after again, What shall vve think? Hath Christ left his body, and dear spouse vvithout help, vvithout government in such dayly and continuall necessities? Or can an ordinarie body be governed vvithout an ordinarie head? To use D. Bilsons vvords,Perpet. go. p. 37. this vvere an heathenish if not a hellish confusion. Ibid. p. 114. He also that vvrote the Manudunction, hath the like, when he saith: A visible church must be consider∣ed as an integrall body: which for the well being of it exercising those operations which belong unto it, and vvhereunto in serveth, must become as we say organicall, having mem∣bers of divers ranks, some as head, mouth, and eyes the Pastor, Teachers, and El∣ders; some as hands, the Deacons and helpers, &c. Manuduct. 2. pag. 33. IIII. Here moreover may be considered the order observed in the
church of Israell: so far forth as it was moral, and concerneth particular churches; & the constitution of the Synagogues, vvherein (besides the o∣ther officers) vvasM. Brou. on Rev. 9. and 14. p. 83. 223. M. Ainsw defence of Scrip. pag. 113. one, vvhō they called SHELIACH TSIBBVR, the ambassadour or Messenger of the congregation. To which, or the like, Christ might haue refe∣rence, whē he speaketh of the Angel of each particular church in Asia, Rev. 2.1.8.12.18. and 3.1.7.14. And of the terme Angel, ascribed to the ministers of the Lord, see also Hag. 1.13. Mal. 2.7. where we find the Prophets and Priests in Israell, called the Angels or Messengers of the Lord. As the Iewes also stil make two sorts of Angels: One of them whom they cal GNEL∣IONIM, because they haue their dwelling in the high places, that is, in the heauens: and the other of them whom they call TACHTONIM, as it were lower or inferiour. And such are the Prophets and Priests: saith Drusius (alledging this) in his Annotations on the New Testament, Rev. 1.20. Besides that in the families and tribes of Is∣raell, and among the Priests and Levites also, they had an orderly consti∣tution, and (according to the distribution of them) some that were heads and chief among them. As may be seen in the Scriptures here before al∣ledged: p. 263. V. Order it self likevvise (besides necessitie often falling out) requireth, that there be some one, vvho in regard of his place, office or condition, may call together the other Elders, and unto vvhom they may resort: Who also vvith them may call the vvhole church together, as there is oc∣casion: And of vvhom the chief or speciall oversight of the Church; the moderation and disposition of the affaires thereof, may be required: To vvhom moreover the letters may be directed and delivered, and other speciall things shevved and advertised, which perteyne to the generall or publike estate of the church: as vve see vvas done by Christ himself, to the Angels of the seuen churches in Asia: Rev. 2.1.8. &c. whereabout al∣so the Epistles sent to Timothee and Titus may haue their due consideration in this behalf: and that vvhich is noted concerning James and the Elders of the church at Ierusalem, Act. 21.18. vvith 2 King. 6, 32. And hereunto doe thus far forth the most learned agree, in the Refor∣med churches; albeit that yet themselues (many of them haue not one particular Pastor in their severall churches. M. Beza ansvvering Saravia, affirmeth, * that by Gods perpetuall ordinance, it hath ben, is, and wilbe needfull,Beza re∣spons. ad Sarav c. 23 fol. 153. that in the Presbyterie or Eldership, some one chief in place and dignitie, should governe and rule the actions, with that right which is giuen unto him of God. Otherwise let it be well considered, vvhether there would not be some defect in the order & constitution of the church: Which seeing it is ordeyned by Christ the Lord, it is certainly most perfect in it self (if we could aright obserue it) and everie way absolute. And how profitable and needfull the observa∣tion of this matter is, may moreover then easily be perceived, when con∣troversies arise (as divers times commeth to passe) eyther among the El∣ders alone, or in the church it self. Besides that the continual oversight & care of other the churches affaires, and the due administration of the ho∣ly things of God, in all good sort, may thus be rightly performed, and a∣greably
to the vvord of God. VI. To the same end may more specially be observed the estate of the church of Ephesus, in the Apostles times: The Overseers and Elders of which church are, in fower several places spoken of in special manner: viz. Act. 20, 17, 28. Ephes. 4, 11, 12. vvith 1, 1. 1 Tim. 5, 17. vvith 1, 3. and 3, 1, 15. Rev. 2, 1. vvith 1, 11, 16, 20. In the first of which places, viz. Act. 20, 17, 28. the Elders are generally spoken off, without the noting of any particular distinction among them. Onely their works and dueties are comprised in the generall termes of taking heed to themselues & the whole flock; of being Overseers; and of feeding the church of God. Which generall termes compre∣hend in them, al the dueties of al the Elders, though otherwise & other∣where distinct one from another. In the second place, viz. Ephes. 4, 11, 12, there is speach onely of the ministers of the vvord, and among them, of the Pastors and Teachers, which are for the vvork of the ministerie more parti∣cularly. In the third place, viz. 1 Tim. 5, 17. there is mention moreover of tvvo sorts of Elders, the Ruling Elders, and the Teaching Elders; and those also distinct the one from the other. In the fourth and last place, viz. Rev. 2, 1. there is mention in particular of the Angell of the church of Ephesus: whom Beza understandeth and expoundeth to be, the President, who was first to haue vvarning of those things, and by him the rest of his Colleages & the whole church. Bez. annot. in Rev. 2, 1. So Piscator likewise expounds it, To the Angell, that is, to the Bishop of the church of Ephesus: and also to the church it self: as appeareth by the words, ver. 7. Piscat. Analys. & Schol. in Apoc. 2, 1. Napier saith: To the Angel, that is, to the Pastor or Minister of the church of Ephesus. Napier in Rev. 2, 1. And Bullinger saith, The Angels are the Embassadours of God, euen the Pastours of the churches. Bulling. concion. 6. in Apoc. And againe, speaking of the church of Smyrna, he saith, The heauenly letter is directed to the Angel of the church of Smyr∣na, that is, to the Pastor. Novv the stories witnesse that Angel and Pastor of the church of Smyrna to haue ben Polycarpus, ordeyned Bishop of the Apostles themselues, I meane, by S. Iohn. Ibid. concione 9. Also among the elder writers, Augustine saith, By the divine voice the Ruler of the Church of Ephesus is praised under the name of an Angell. August. epist. 162. And Gregorie saith, The Preachers in the Scri∣ptures are sometimes called Angels, as the Prophet saith,Mal. 2.7. the lippes of the Priest should keep knovvledge, and they should seek the Lavv at his mouth: for he is the Angell or Messenger of the Lord of hostes. Gregor. moralium in Iob. lib. 11. c. 3. Thus much briefly I thought to note in particular touching the estate of the Church of Ephesus, and the Bishops or Overseers thereof: vvhich being four se∣verall times spoken of in the Scripture, and that also vvith such different manner of speach, as is aforesaid: may help to giue good light and dire∣ction unto us about the question in hand. VII. Finally, if the foresaid order be kept, vve may by the vvord of God sufficiently ansvver all the objections, and meet with all the corru∣ptions of the Prelates, or any other, that erre in this behalf from the sim∣plicitie & first constitution of the primitiue churches. Which how it can otherwise in deed so well and soundly be done, had need duly to be con∣sidered
of all that beare vvitnesse against them. And hitherto concerning the first braunch of this question. Novv for the other point of the question, there is alledged about it both Scripture,M. Sm. dif∣fer. pag. 23 &c. M. Parker Polit. eccles l. 3. c. 18. p. 236. &c. and record of auncient writers. The Scriptures are these, and the like, Act. 20.17.28. Phi. 1.1. 1 Thes. 5.12. 1 Tim. 3. and Tit. 1 ch. 1 Pet. 5.1 — 4. Which are alledged, to shew that the Primitiue Churches had many Elders in one church (which is graunted) and those also all alike; & therefore that they had not one speciall Pastor, nor (as some think) such distinction of teaching and ruling Elders, as is aforesaid. The record of the auncient Writers produced also thereabout, is to shew that sometimes there were tvvo Bishops at once, in one church. Of which more hereafter. 1. Now first for the Scriptures (leaving the point, for the truth there∣of, so to be esteemed, as it shalbe found to be grounded on the Scriptures duly considered) there is alledged, Act. 20, 17, 28. vvhereby is gathered: First, that there vvere many Elders in the Church of Ephesus (there spo∣ken off) and not one Pastor alone. Which I think none of sound judg∣ment vvill deny. Secondly, that the Elders were all alike, and of one sort, &c. Which if it were so, then 1. how is it, that the Apostle vvriteth to Timothee (vvhom he left with the Church of Ephesus) both of teach∣ing and of ruling Elders, and the one differing from the other? 1 Tim. 5, 17. compared with 1 Tim. 1, 3. 2. What then also or vvhere is the difference betweeene the Pastors, and Teachers, spoken off to the same church of Ephesus? Ephes. 4.11.12. 3. And who is the Angel of this church of Ephesus, spoken of, Rev. 2.1. 4. Or vvhere are the ruling Elders called the Angels of the Lord, or of the church, as the Prophets, Priests, and ministers of the Gospell are, Hag. 1.13. Mal. 2.7. with Rev. 1.20. and 2.1.8. &c. 5. And why may vve not think, that there were both teaching and ru∣ling Elders in the Church of Ephesus, asvvell as in other of the Primitiue churches, as may appeare by that vvhich is written, Rom. 12, 7, 8. and 1 Cor. 5.8.28. compared vvith 1 Tim. 5.17. and with the practise and estate of Israel, Jer. 19, 1. Luke 22, 66. vvith 2 King. 6, 32. and 2 Chron. 19, 8, &c. 6. And that there vvas also some one in the church of Ephesus (as Ar∣chippus in the church of Colosse, Col. 4, 17. & Polycarpus, as divers write, in the church of Smyrna (spoken off, Rev. 2, 8.) Irenaeus l. 3. c. 3. Euseb. l. 3. c. 32. and l. 4. c. 14. &c.) to vvhom Christ directed his letters, and of whom he straitly required to look to the contents thereof:To redresse errors and abuses in the church, &c. the matters being all of them such, as the Pastor, who hath speciall charge of the flock, should carefully regard and obserue, according to the duetie of his office, under the Archpastor Iesus Christ. Rev. 2.1. &c. 7. To vvhich end may also be observed, that seuen starres, are spoken off, ansvverably to the number of the seuen golden Candlesticks: & that three times, one after another, Rev. .12.13.16. Also Rev. 1.20. And Rev. 2.1. Besides the mention again of seuen starres, together with mention of the seuen Spirits of God. Revel. 3.1. Which whether it may not in some re∣spects
be observed, for the other point, and divers other good purposes also, let it be duely considered. 8. And hereunto agreeth the testimonie of the auncient writers (Ire∣naeus, Eusebius, &c.) who make mention in particular of the names & suc∣cession of divers Bishops or Pastors (so specially called) following one another, from the Apostles daies, for a long time after: hovv ever in tract of time, corruption grew in, and then from the oversight of one particu∣lar church, they became Bishops of many churches, euen of whole Dioce∣ses and Provinces, &c. 9. And whereas it is alledged, that the Apostle gaue not the Elders (Act. 20, 17, 28.) severall charges, as having severall dueties lying upon them, but one generall charge, common to them all, namely the dutie of feeding, vvhich is the work of the Pastor, &c. there may also here about be considered, 1. that they vvere in generall al of them Bishops & Over∣seers of the flock and church of Ephesus: and therefore might well haue this charge giuen them in generall, & jointly together. And yet this not hinder, but that they might also in other respect haue distinction of place and function among themselues notvvithstanding. As may be seen in o∣ther cases and generall speaches used often in the Scriptures: as in Deut. 33.8.10. Iosh. 23, 2 and 24, 1, &c. 1 Chron. 28, 1, 2, &c. 2 Chron. 19, 5 — 9. &c. Ier. 19, 1, 3. &c. Hos. 5, 1. &c. And more especially, 2 Chron. 29, 3 4, 5. &c. where king Hezekiah gaue a charge jointly and in generall termes, to the Priests and Levites (the ministers of the Temple) for the sanctifying of them∣selues and purging of the Temple. Yet vvho vvould thereupon conclude, that all the Levites vvere Priests; or that there vvas no distinction be∣tvveen their offices in other respects, or that the ministers of the Temple vvere all alike, and of one sort? 2. All things are not spoken in al places: and Scripture must be compared with Scripture, for the right understan∣ding thereof. When therefore other Scriptures shevv a difference, vve must thence learne it, and not because of some general or other speaches, misconstrue or confound things, vvhich the Scriptures othervvhere teach us aright to distinguish. Othervvise men might inferre upon Moses ge∣nerall speach, Deu. 33, 8, 10. that all the Levites might burne incense be∣fore the Lord, and that therefore Corah the Levite sinned not in so do∣ing: Num. 16 ch. Which vvere indeed to pervert the Scripture, and not to understand it aright. 3. Though a speach be generall, and such as may in some respects perteine unto all, yet may it also be sufficient for their un∣derstanding and stirring up, vvho othervvise knovv themselues vvell the distinction of their places or offices one from another, and vvhat apper∣teyneth to their severall dueties thereabout. Like as the Levites, who, al∣though Hezekiahs speach aforesaid was generall, and vvas made unto them together with the Priests, yea though the Temple vvas novv pol∣luted, yet kept themselues vvithin their bounds, and did not so much as goe into the inner part of the Temple, that apperteyned to the Priests done. 2 Chron. 29, 16. 4. The terme of feeding, and the vvord Pastor, and
other the like (both in Scripture, and in other writers) are used sometimes largely and generally, sometimes strictly and particularly. In the former understanding, are kings and Princes called Pastors, & said to feed, 1 Chro. 11, 2. Psal. 78, 70, 71, 72. Esa 47, 28. Ier. 6, 3. and 13, 18, 20. and 22, 22. and 49, 19. and 50, 44. Ezech. 34, 2. Christ also, Ezech. 34, 23. and 37, 24. Zach. 13, 7. Ioh. 10, 11, 16. Heb. 13, 20. 1 Pet. 2, 25. and 5, 4. and the Apostles, Ioh. 21, 16. and all governors both civill and ecclesiasticall, Jer. 3, 15. and 17, 16. and 23, 1, 2, 4. and 50, 6. Zach. 11, 5, 8. Act. 20, 17, 28. 1 Pet. 5, 1, 2. In the latter significati∣on, it is used for the Pastors and ministers, that are expressely distinguish∣ed from the Apostles, Prophets, Euangelists, and Teachers, spoken of Eph. 4, 11, 12. and are also called Exhorters, or Comforters, Rom. 12, 8. to whom the wor of wisedome is ascribed, 1 Cor. 12, 8. As in Israell they had ministers that vvere called, Wise men, Mat. 23, 34. So then in the generall use of the word, all the Elders and governours of particular Churches are Pastors, and doe feed according to the duetie of their office, 1 Pet. 5.1, 2. Acts 20, 17, 28. And thus there were and may be many Pastors in particular chur∣ches. But shall we therefore conclude, that there was no particular office of Pastor in the churches; no difference betvveen the teaching and ruling Elders; no distinction betvveen the Pastors and Teachers office, &c. 10. Lastly, vvhereas others also alledge this Scripture (Act. 20, 17, 28.M. Bright. on Rev. 2.1. &c.) to shew that by the Angell of the Church of Ephesus (Rev. 2, 1.) is meant the whole Colledge of Pastors, Elders, and Bishops: let these reasons a∣foresaid be well observed about that point also: for the better fynding out and clearing of the truth in this behalf. And so I proceed to note somewhat likewise about the other Scriptures before mentioned touch∣ing the matter in hand. The other Scriptures are these, Phil. 1, 1. 1 Thes. 5, 12. 1 Tim. 3 ch. and Tit. 1 ch. 1 Pet. 5, 1, 2. Which all of them haue this common unto them, that the like collections are made out of them, as out of Acts 20.17.28. And therefore the same things may be observed about them, as haue ben no∣ted here already about Acts 20.17.28. That so I need not repeat the same things over againe and againe. Onely I will briefly annexe some fewe things more concerning these Scriptures in particular. 2. With that place of Phi. 1.1. where the Apostle speaketh of the Bishops of that church, as being many: there may be compared another place in the same epistle, where the Apostle saith, I intreat thee also, true yokefellow. &c. Phil. 4, 3. By which manner of speach, may be observed, that though there were sundry Elders and Bishops in that church, yet there vvas notwith∣standing also some speciall man, vvhom the Apostle in speciall and more particularly called his true yoke-fellow. Whether it were the Pastor, or not, I will not determine. And who it should be, rather then the Pastor (that by such a peculiar attribute, without particular naming of him, should be intended by the Apostle, and understood by them to whome he vvrote) I desire to haue shevved by others. The question that is made about the gender, is of no vvaight. For besides the matter spoken off, and other cir∣cumstances
of the place, the Syriak translation putteth the matter out of doubt, which hath it thus, I entreat thee also, O sonne of my yoke, &c. vvhich shevveth both that he spake of a man, & of one that was of speciall note and imployment. Tremellius & Iunius, in their notes on the Syriak tran∣slation, expound it thus, The sonne of my yoke, that is, partaker of the same yoke vvith me, vvhich art my helper in the same ministerie. A metaphor taken from bulloks, who being put under the same yoke, are used by men to one and the same ministerie & service. Also Ignatius writing to the church of Philippi, nameth Vitalis Bi∣shop (or Pastor) of that church. And here, in the Apostles next Epistle, which is to the Colossians, he speaketh of Archippus by name, touching the fulfilling of his ministerie, in the church of Colosse, Col. 4, 17. 3. The next Scripture, 1 Thes. 5, 12. as it sheweth that there were divers Elders in that church: so the vvords there used (of labouring, ruling or being over them in the Lord, informing or admonishing them) may notwithstanding im∣ply, that there vvas distinction of place and office among them: as more plainly appeareth, 1 Tim. 5, 17. where the like vvords are used, in the Apo∣stles speach concerning the Elders, and the distinction of their office and duties: And as likevvise may be observed in Hezekiahs speach to the priests and Levites, and in the termes there used, though he spake unto them jointly together. 2 Chron. 29, 4, 5. compared with v. 11. Besides that Ori∣gen writeth of Gajus by name, reported to haue ben Bishop of the church of Thessalonica. Origen. l. 10. in cap. 16. epist. ad Romanos. 4. Both the places in 1 Tim. 3. and Tit. 1 ch. shew likevvise, that there vvere sundry Elders, in the churches of Ephesus and Crete. Yet this hindreth not, but that they had also difference of office and function among them, as may appeare by comparing 1 Tim. 5.17. Ephes. 4, 11, 12. Rev. 2, 1. and Rom. 12, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. with the places aforesaid: and may be implyed by the par∣ticular properties and dueties required of them: besides the estate and practise of the church of Israell, vvhich giueth great light in this behalf, as hath ben observed. If any understand these places (in 1 Tim. 3. and Tit. 1 ch.) to speak of such Elders onely as were ministers, yet that vvill be no hinderance neyther. For seeing the Priests and Levites in Israell vvere all of the tribe of Levi, and lineally descending one from another, according to their kinred: vvhich novv is not so in the Pastors and Teachers (for a lineall descent, one of another according to kinred, though otherwise they succeed and follovv one another in their place and function:) and now the Pastors & Teachers are by the Lord taken out of the Gentiles and become answe∣rable to the Priests and Levites, (Esa. 66, 18 — 21. and Jer. 33, 15 — 22.) there∣fore vvas it needfull, that there should in speciall manner be mention, in the Apostles vvritings,The like may be ob∣served a∣bout the Deacons: ho are in diver things much an∣swerable to the Levites in Israel: as to the Levi∣ticall Trea∣surers, &c. of their offices, and of their properties, qualities, and dueties, &c. Which needed not so much to be, about the ruling El∣ders chosen out of the people, who are answerable to the like Elders in Israell (notwithstanding the differences of estate) & are stil to be endow∣ed with like qualities, as those Elders were: as may be seen by obser∣ving
the qualities mentioned in Exod. 18, 21. and Deut. 1, 13, 15, 16, 17. com∣pared also with 1 Cor. 6, 5. and 12, 28. Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5, 17. And here let it be considered, vvhether if a Synagogue of the Ievves (or many thereof were converted to the Christian faith, the rulers of the Synagogue (becoming Christians) might not novv be taken or kept still to be ruling Elders of the church: (such as we read off, Acts 13, 15. and 18, 8. and Mar. 5.22, &c. whereas the Priests & Levites comming to the faith (as divers did, Acts 6, 7.) they vvere necessarily to leaue their Leviticall office: and then, being fit, might become ministers of the Gospel, and so continevv in that ministration & employment, as before they did in the other. Heb. 9, 6, 7. and 13, 10. with Acts 4, 36. and 11, 22 — 26. and 13, 1 — 5. &c. Rom. 15, 16. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14. and with Esa. 66, 21, 22, 23. In vvhich respects, let it also be observed, whether the difference should not now in the church still carefully be kept betvveene the ruling Elders, and betvveen the ministers of the Gospell, the Pastors and Teachers: as there was heretofore in Israell betvveen the Elders of the people, and the ministers of the Temple, the Priests and Levites. Exod. 18, 21. with 28 chap. Numb. 11, 16. vvith 3, and 4, and 8, and 16, and 18 ch. Deu. 1, 13 — 18. vvith 10.8. and 33, 8 — 11. 2 Chro. 19, 5 — 8 — 11. Jer. 19, 1. Luke 22, 66. Act. 4, 5, 6. and 5, 21, 34. and 22, 5, 30. compared with 1 Tim. 5, 17. Rom. 12, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. Ephes. 4, 11, 12, 13. Acts 20, 17, 28. Phil. 1, 1. Col 4, 17. 1 Thes, 5, 12, 13, 14. Hebr. 13, 7, 17. Rev. 2, 1. &c. And this, both for the difference of the offices themselues, & of the dueties and ministration thereof: and for sundry other points and questions hereabout: and namely, for the continuance of the ministers in their offices and functions; as did the Priests and Levites in the ministe∣rie, though there be a yerely or other like chaunge of the ruling Elders: as is novv observed among the Ievves (touching the rulers of their Sy∣nagogues) and is very usuall in such policies as are Aristocraticall, or De∣mocraticall, &c. Although some also vvrite, that in the church succeeding the Apostles times, the Elders and Deacons were chosen to be perpetual: and that speach of the Apostle, concerning the Deacons purchasing to themselues a good degree, if they haue used the office of a Deacon well, is duly to be regarded thereabout. 1 Tim. 3, 13. But having thus by the way noted these things: let us novv further∣more (touching the places aforesaid, & the matter in hand) obserue here∣withall, hovv the speaches in those Epistles, are by the Apostle directed both unto Timothee and Titus, in the singular number: (as is also by Christ to the Angels of the severall churches, Rev. 2 & 3 chap.) And whe∣ther this may not imply, that in the churches vvhere either of these came and vvere left by the Apostle, or vvhere there vvere not Pastors as yet, ei∣ther they themselues (albeit Euangelists othervvise) did novv (for the time) supply the Pastors place and office there: as Iames is observed to haue done at Ierusalem, though he vvas an Apostle othervvise. Act. 21, 18. or that vvhat they did (for a time) in the severall Churches, where they came, being Euangelists: the same (in al things ordinarie and perpetual)
should still be done by the Pastors, in their particular and peculiar Chur∣ches, from time to time, untill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ. Whereabout that charge, so earnestly giuen to Timothee in special, is wel to be observed, being expressely giuen to endure, untill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ: 1 Tim. 6, 13, 14. which could not (as I noted here before) be done by Timothee in his ovvne person (who dyed, after he had served his ovvne generation by the vvill of God) but was to be performed by his successors, from time to time, unto the end of the vvorld. As may al∣so appeare by comparing 1 Tim. 6, 13, 14. with Rev. 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7, 14. and Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. And more particularly, touching the church of Ephesus, where Timo∣thee abode some time (1 Tim. 1.3.) Eusebius giues record of Onesimus the Pastor of that church: shevving how Ignatius, vvhen he was at Smyrna, vvhere Polycarpus vvas, vvrote an Epistle to the church of Ephesus, ma∣king mention of Onesimus the Pastor thereof. Euseb. l. 3. c. 32. Besides the speciall mention of the Angell of the church of Ephesus, like as of the church of Smyrna, and the other churches particularly spoken of, Rev. 2.1.8.14.18. and 3.1.7.14. and that the contents, both of Christs letters di∣rected to the Angels of the churches, and of the Apostles to Timothee & Titus, are of such matters, as concern the Pastors office, who by his name, gift, work, and duties of his calling, hath speciall charge of the flock over vvhich he is set, in such things as Christ and the Apostle haue written off, in the Epistles aforesaid. And for the churches in Crete, vvhere Titus was left, Tit. 1.5. the like may be mynded, as of the other churches aforesaid: seeing they vvere so to be established, as Paul had appointed Titus: and the Apostles wayes vvere alike tovvards all churches, as Paul himself witnesseth. 1 Cor. 4.17. and 14.33. and 16, 1. Col. 4.16.17. and Tit. 1.5. with 1 Tim. 6.13.14. 5. There is a place likevvise, in Heb. 13.7.17.24. shewing that there vvere divers Elders in the churches of the Ievves. Yet neither doth this hinder, but that they had also distinction of office among them, for tea∣ching and ruling Elders: as there the Apostle speaketh of such, who spake the word of God unto them, and were their guydes and governours, vvatching for their soules, as they that should giue account, &c. where moreover the Apostle useth a vvord (HEGOUMENOI,) signifying Guydes, Leaders, Captaines, Rulers, Go∣vernours, chief, &c. vvhich is attributed to the Overseers & Governours both in church and common wealth, yea euen unto kings, and to Christ him∣self: Gen. 49, 10. 1 Sam. 25, 30. 2 Sam. 5, 2, 1 King. 14, 27. 2 King. 20, 5. 1 Chron. 26, 24. and 27, 4, 16. Psal. 68, 27. Dan 3, 2. Mat, 2, 6. Luc. 22, 26. Acts 7, 10. who is here also (in this chapter, Heb. 13, 20.) called the great Shepheard (or Pa∣stor) of the sheep: under vvhom the other Pastors and Guydes aforesaid▪ ministred, and guyded the flocks committed unto them. And in Israell of old, they had among the Iewes, both Elders of the Priests, and Elders of the people: besides other differences of the ministers and Governors a∣mong them: as vvas noted there before. And in the church at Ierusalem
(since Christ) there was Iames, together with the Elders, overseeing the affaires of that church. Act. 21, 18, &c. And Eusebius vvith other auncient Writers, notes the names of sundry Bishops (or Pastors) who after Iames follovved, one another, in that church, for a long time aftervvard: as is aforesaid. 6. Concerning the place, in 1 Pet. 5, 1 — 4. the same things may be ob∣served, as about the other Scriptures before mentioned. And this more∣over, that Peter (an Apostle) doth here call himself an Elder, and a fellow-Elder, vvith the rest: ver. 1. So generall is the word, and comprising in it Elders of divers sorts and offices: as euen this place undeniably sheweth. Where may be noted further, how Christ is here called the Archpastor, or chief Shepheard, ver. 4. Which again plainely implyeth other Pastors & Bi∣shops, that are inferiour and subordinate unto him, vvho is the chief and great shepheard of the sheep, and Bishop of our soules. Heb. 13, 20. and 1 Pet. 2, 25. and 5, 1 — 4. with Ioh. 21.15, 16.17. Act. 20, 17, 28. Rom. 12.7.8. Ephe. 4.11, 12. 1 Tim. 5, 17. Rev. 2, 1, 8. &,. And hitherto of these things concer∣ning these allegations out of the Scripture. Another allegation, about the matter aforesaid, is taken out of aun∣cient writers,Park. Po∣lit. eccles. p. 236. &c. shewing that in some churches heretofore there were two Bishops (or Pastors) in one and the same office, in one church at once. As namely, that there vvas in the church of Ierusalem, at once, Narcissus and Alexander: and in the church of Hippo, Valerius and Augustine; in Rome, Felix & Liberius; in Nazianzum, Gregorie the father, & Gregorie the sonne, &c. Euseb. l. 6. c. 7.9.10. Sozomen. l. 4. c. 14. August. epist. 110. Gregor. Nazianz. epist. ad Gregor. Nyssenum. Whereabout may be considered, I. Whether this vvas ordinarie, or extraordinarie. If ordinarie, how is it then that the same & other auncient vvriters, doe usually still make mention but of one, in one church, at one time, as in their vvritings everie vvhere may be seen? If extraordinarie and upon some speciall occasions, what then vvas the or∣dinarie course that vvas otherwise kept and observed usually? II. By the instances alledged, it appeareth that there were but two of these Bishops, in these churches, at those times: Whereas by the Scri∣ptures alledged, and the generall acknovvledgement almost of all, there may be many Elders or Bishops in a church, and far moe then tvvo. Yea if there were but one pastor, one teacher, & one ruling Elder, in a church, there vvould yet be moe Elders or Bishops then two at once. III. The tvvo aforesaid also vvere both of them teaching Elders, and Ministers of the vvord and Sacraments: vvhereas the Scriptures shevve, that there vvere and should be in the Church, both teaching and ruling Elders. IIII. The vvriters vvhich mention these, note some special occasions thereof, as that it was in case of old age, or sicknes, or special good liking and approbation of the parties, and returning to the churches and places from which through troubles or otherwise they had some vvhile ben ab∣sent, or other the like: and some difference vvithall observed betvveene
some of them. Which is also duly to be regarded. For vvhich, see the ∣ters and places aforesaid. V. The time moreover is to be noted, when this vvas done. Which by the instances alledged, appeareth to be some good vvhile after the Apo∣stles dayes: Whereas the question is, concerning the primitiue instituti∣on, and practise from the beginning. VI. Also, if such examples in later times, so recorded by these writers, should be respected, vvhy should not then the other examples of former times, recorded by the same and other Writers likewise? VII. And finally, the onely sure ground of truth, and end of contro∣versies in Religion, is the word of God: vvherevvith so far as the aunci∣ent Writers accord, their testimonies & vvritings may in their place well be regarded. According to it therefore I leaue these things, vvith the o∣ther before alledged out of the Scriptures, to be considered & discussed. And hitherto of the latter braunch of this question. Novv furthermore, note withall, that how ever it be for the matter in hand, touching the Pastors and other Elders of particular churches: yet still it lyeth on them, who receiue or plead for Diocesan and Provinciall churches, Pastors, or Bishops, that they shevv such churches and Pastors planted by the Apostles at the beginning. For if it cannot be shevved, that the Apostles (by vertue of their commission from Christ) established such Diocesan and Provincial churches and Bishops, who then may esta∣blish or submit unto them? If they vvho were the Master-builders under Christ, did not set them up, vvhat povver then is there under heauen that may erect them? and what homage is it, that a Christian soule can with good conscience yeeld unto them, in this behalf? 2. The churches must be such, and so established, as the Lord appoint∣eth and approveth in his vvord. Revel. 1, 12, 20. And everie officer in the church must (in a due regard) be counted a mēber in the body of Christ. Rom. 12, 3 — 8. 1 Cor. 12, 12 — 28. Ephes. 4, 4 — 16. And none may set members in the body of Christ, but the Lord himself. 1 Cor. 12, 18, 28. &c. Euen as on the cōtrarie none may keep out, despise, or abandon those vvhom the Lord hath appointed to be in his church, and to continevv therein, to the end of the vvorld. Rom. 12.6.7.8. Ephe. 4, 11, 12. with Esa. 66, 21. 1 Tim. 3.1 — 15. and 5, 3, 9, 17. with 6, 13, 14. and with Mat. 28.18.19.20. Luke 10.16. and 12, 42, 43. Ioh. 13, 20. 1 Pet. 5, 1 — 4. Rev. 1, 16, 20. and 2, 1, 8, &c. 3. Moreover the functions & duties of such Prelates (if they be mem∣bers of the body of Christ) are to be shewed out of the word of God: as vve see done for the Officers of particular churches. Rom. 12, 6, 7, 8. Ephes. 4.11.12. vvith Esa. 66.21. 1 Thes. 5.12.13.24. 1 Tim. 5.17, Rev. 2.1.8. &c. and as vvas in Israell, for the hy Priest, and for the other Priests and Levites: be∣sides that vvhich was in their cities and Synagogues. Exod. 28. and 29. Lev. 1 — 16 chap. &c. Num. 3, and 4, and 8. Deut. 16 — 19 chap. Josh. 21 chap. 1 Chron. 23 — 26 ch. Luke 4, 16 — 20. Act. 13.14.15. &c. 4. The place also and manner, vvhere and hovv such Bishops doe and
can meet together with the rest of the body whereof they are members, that is, with their Diocesan and Provinciall churches, is to be shewed in their practise, & agreable to the Scriptures: as may be done for the Pa∣stors of particular churches, and their assemblies, Rev. 1, 20. and 2 and 3 ch. vvith Acts 20.17.28. Rom. 12.4 — 8. Col. 4.16.17. 1 Thes. 5.12.13.14.27. Heb. 13.7.17.24. Jam. 2.2. vvhere the Apostle calleth the assemblies of Christians, Synagogues: vvhich (as I noted before) may haue reference to the Syna∣gogues of the Ievves. Mat. 4, 23. Luke 4, 16 — 20. Acts 13.5.14.15.42. and 14.1. and 17.1.2. and 18.4.7.8. &c. As also Ierusalem was the place, whither the Iewes were bound to come thrise a yere, and where the high Priest and the other Priests and Levites that ministred there, were bound to sa∣crifice, and performe the other duties of their callings, for the vvhole church, from time to time, according as the Lord particularly appointed in his word. 5. Yea the higher and greater that the members and functions are, which the Lord hath set in his church, the more undoubted it is, that they are specially described in his word, and the more needfull both for the church and the Officers themselues, to haue certain knowledge and assu∣rance thereof. As was for the chief Priests, & other officers of the church of Israell. Necessarie therefore it is, that the Diocesan and Provinciall Churches (if any such vvere planted by the Apostles) and the office, entrance, & ad∣ministration, of Diocesan and Provinciall Bishops (vvhich challenge to be chief in the church, and distinct from the Pastors and Bishops of particu∣lar churches) should be shewed out of the Scriptures, by such as hold & would uphold them, if they could. The Catholike church of Rome (as they call it) and the universall Bi∣shop thereof, I omit: as being Antichristian most of all, and justly left by the Protestants and Reformed churches. Though yet far more (in some respects) might be pretended for this, from the state of Ierusalem & the High Priests, that vvere for the universall church, then for the Diocesan or Provinciall churches and Bishops. If any alledge in this behalf (as some use to doe) the examples of Timo∣thee abiding at Ephesus, and Titus left at Crete, by the appointment of the Apostle, for the oversight and government of those churches, &c. & the subscriptions also of those Epistles, vvherein both of them are styled, the first Bishops of those churches: let these things be observed thereabout: 1. That those subscriptions are Apocryphall, and not part of the Scripture it self. 2. That some Greek copies, and the Syriack, and old Latin translation also, haue not this style or title at all. 3. That Timothee and Titus were Euangelists, vvho were sent & ap∣pointed by the Apostles, sometimes to one place, sometimes to another, as they had occasion. 2 Tim. 4.5.9. Tit. 1.5. and 3.12. whereas the Pastors & Bishops vvere appointed to their peculiar flock and seat. Act. 20.17, 28. 1 Pet. 5.1 — 4. Rev. 1.20. and 2.1.8. &c. If eyther of these were so particularly
employed afterward, it helps not the matter. 4. The first Epistle of Timothee, hath not this in the subscription. And in the latter Epistle, where the subscription styleth Timothee, the first Bi∣shop of the church of the Ephesians, there doth Paul in the same Epistle, both terme him an Euangelist, and exhorte him to doe the work of an Euangelist, 2 Tim, 4.5. yea and call him from the church of Ephesus, (which was in A∣sia) to come unto him to Rome, (which was in Italie) 2 Tim. 4, 9, 21. if the subscription be right. Likevvise in the Epistle to Titus, vvhere the subscri∣ption styleth him, the first Bishop of the church of the Cretians, there doth Paul, in the same Epistle, call him from Creta (in Greece) to Nicopolis (in Arme∣nia.) Tit. 1, 5. vvith 3, 12. And these things may be observed in those Epi∣stles themselues, vvhere these subscriptions are: besides that other Scri∣ptures doe also shevve, hovv they vvere sometimes in one part of the world, and sometimes in another, sometimes in Asia, and sometimes in Europe, doing the duties of their office. As that Timothee vvas in Asia, in divers countreyes and parts thereof, in Phrygia, Galatia, Mysia, Ionia, &c. And in Europe also, in Macedonia, Achaia, Italie, &c. And in these coun∣treyes and nations, sometimes in one city and with one church, & some∣times vvith another, for divers occasions & purposes: as namely at Thes∣salonica, at Athens, at Corinth, at Ephesus, at Rome, at Philippi, &c. For al vvhich see these Scriptures, Acts 16 ch. and 17, 14, 15. and 18, 5. and 19, 22. and 20, 4. Rom. 16, 21. 1 Cor. 4, 17. and 16, 10, 11. 2 Cor. 1, 19. Phil. 1, 1. and 2, 19, 22, 23. 1 Thes. 3, 1, 2, 6. with both the Epistles to Timothee And that Titus likevvise was sometimes in Europe, at divers places: as at Corinth in Achaia; at Rome in Italie; in Creta, and Dalmatia in Greece, &c. And sometimes in Asia, as at Jerusalem in Iudea, at Nicopolis in Armenia, &c. As is evident by these Scri∣ptures, 2 Cor. 8, 23, 24. and 12, 18. Gal 2.1. 2 Tim. 4.10. Tit. 1, 4, 5. and 3.12, vvith the whole Epistle to Titus. By vvhich also appeareth, that Timothee and Titus, were Euangelists, & so imployed by the Apostle Paul, sundry times, and in sundry places. 5. Besides, the church of Ephesus, vvas a particular, & not a Diocesan or Provinciall church: as may appeare both by the places, vvhere it is particularly spoken off, Acts 20, 17 — 28. Ephes. 1.1. 1 Tim. 1.3. and 3.15. Rev. 1, 11.12. and 2.1. & by the like estate of the other Churches of Asia, writ∣ten unto by Christ, Rev. 1.4.11.12.13.16.20. and 2.8.12.18. and 3.17.14. com∣pared vvith Col. 4.16. And so this toucheth not the point in hand. Creta in deed is an Iland, wherein were divers cities: but in every of them were Elders and Bishops ordeyned, as is here plainly expressed. Tit. 1, 5, 6, 7. &c. And by this Scripture it seemeth, that when the Apostle departed from thence, all things vvere not yet finished among them: vvhereupon he left Titus behind him, to set in order the things that were wanting, and to ordeyne Elders and Bishops in every city. Wherein vvhat other thing did Titus, then vvhat any other Euangelist so left there might haue done? Which also the Apostle himself might and vvould haue done, if he had re∣mayned there longer, and yet haue ben an Apostle still, though for the
time or by that occasion he had ben so particularly imployed there? And when this was done there by Titus, Paul called him from thence to come unto him to Nicopolis: as vve haue noted here before, out of the same Epistle. Tit. 3, 12. 6. Moreover, the vvord Bishop or Overseer is sometimes used generally and very largely: so as the office of an Apostle is sometimes so called, Acts 1, 20. 7. And lastly, vvhy might not the Euangelists, being in an office supe∣riour to the Pastors or Bishops of particular churches, haue and supply their place in any Church, vvhere they came and remayned: & yet this be no ground or warrant of Diocesan or Provincial Bishops & churches: any more then Iames so being at Ierusalem, who othervvise vvas an Apo∣stle? Act. 21.18. Euseb. l. 2. c. 23. & l. 3. c. 11. & l. 7. c. 18. For the further consideration vvhereof, besides that vvhich hath ben said before, I will here propound two things (in an otherReasons touching cōmunica∣ting with the Minist. of the church of Engl. p. 26. &c. treatise men∣tioned heretofore) vvhich as they shalbe found to haue waight, may giue more light to these and other points sometimes called in question. 1. The first is this: Whether the Lords ordinance in his church be not such, as the higher offices conteyne in them and comprehend the inferi∣or offices: so as they vvhich be in the greater offices, haue (besides their ovvne peculiar function, vvhereunto they ought to attend) povver and authoritie both themselues to performe the duties of the inferiour offi∣ces, when there is needfull occasion; and to look that they be performed by all such as they are specially layd upon, for the better service of the Lord and his church therein. As may be observed, both by the estate of Israell heretofore, in the Priests, and Levites, &c. and by divers things written concerning the Apostles, Euangelists, Pastors, and other Elders, in sundry cases. For example, that the Apostles, who were in the greatest ec∣clesiasticall office ordeyned by Christ under the Gospell, had (besides the peculiar office of Apostleship) the povver also and authoritie of the offi∣ces of the Euangelists, Pastors, Teachers, Elders, & Deacons, both to per∣forme them upon just occasion themselues, & to see them performed by others as is aforesaid. In like sort, that the Euangelists (besides their own peculiar office and function) had in them the povver and authority of the inferior offices of Pastors, Teachers, and Elders, &c. And likevvise, that the Pastors (besides their own peculiar function) haue in them the power and authoritie of the Teachers and other ordinarie offices, for perfor∣mance and oversight of them, as is aforesaid. Also, that the Elders (besides their ovvne speciall function) haue in them the povver and authoritie of the Deacons office, for the doing and overseeing thereof, as was said be∣fore, and so forth in the rest. For all vvhich see, Acts 2, 40, 41, 42. and 4, 34, 35. and 6, 1 — 6. and 8, 14, 25, 26, 35, 38. vvith 21, 8. and 11, 29, 30. and 14, 7, 23. & 15, 6, 22, 32, 35, 36, 40, 41. and 16, 4.40. and 20, 7, 11, 17, 28, 29, 30. & 21, 18 — 25. vvith Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. Ioh. 20, 21, 22, 23. and 21, 15, 16, 17. 1 Cor. 4, 15, 17, 22. and 5, 3. and 9.7.16.17. and 10.16. and 12.28. and 16, 3.4.10. 2 Cor. 1.19. and 8.
16.17.23. Ephes. 4.11.12. Phil. 1.1. and 4.3. 1 Thes. 3.2. and 5.12.13.14.27. Hebr. 13.7.17. 1 Pet. 5.1 — 4. Rev. 2.1. &c. 2. The second is this: Whether on the contrarie, the apostasie of An∣tichrist be not such (as touching the ministerie and government of the church) as therein they vvhich be in the lesser and inferiour offices, haue power & authoritie, vvith them, to exceed the dueties of the office which Christ hath appointed, and to performe the duties apperteyning to the higher offices: by meanes vvhereof both Antichrist hath risen up to so great a height, and so many orders and degrees of superior and inferior ministers haue ben received, & stil are reteyned in that degenerate estate and apostasie of the man of sinne, as is come to passe. As namely, when the pastors and bishops of particular congregations came to haue power & authoritie over many churches & over the Ministers & people there∣in: in a kind of resemblance of the extraordinarie offices (of the Apostles and Euangelists) alreadie ceased: vvhen now the foundation was layd. Contrarie to that which is written, Rom. 17, 3 — 8. Rev. 1, 11, 12.13, 16, 20. with 2, 1, 8, 12, 18. and 3, 1, 7, 14. Ephes. 4, 11, 12, 13. Act. 20, 17, 28. Phil. 1, 1. and 4, 3. 1 Pet. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. And that the ruling Elders or Presbyters did the ministe∣riall duties of the Pastors and Teachers, in the particular Congregations. Contrarie to 1 Tim. 5, 17. Ephes 4, 11, 12. Rom. 12, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. And that the Deacons also baptise, and became ministers of the word (in the office of Deaconship) vvhich the Apostles did expressely oppose to the duties of that office, at the institution thereof. Act. 6.2.3.4. So as of these things and the like in that estate, it may be said, as Christ did in another case, From the beginning it was not so. Mat. 19.8. These things and the like may be noted about the points & questions aforesaid. Which being not vvell observed in former ages, a way vvas made for the Popes supremacy, by the steps of the Diocesan and Provin∣ciall Prelacy: whiles each Pastor kept not his place, & within his bounds, under Christ the Archpastor, nor the other Officers theirs, nor the Chur∣ches that order vvherein they vvere set by the Apostles at the beginning. Which being novv in this latter age observed and discovered, we should set our selues to reject and witnesse against the Antichristian apostasie of the man of sinne, and all the aberrations and iniquitie thereof: And be carefull on the other hand, to returne to the auncient simplicity of the churches of Christ, as they were planted in the beginning: alvvaies ob∣serueing good order in all things, and that vvay of government of the church, which is appointed by the vvord of God. CHAPTER VII. Touching the Teachers office more particularly, and the Ministers of the word in generall. VVHether there be not tvvo sorts of Teachers or Prophets (which the Lord hath giuen for the work of the ministerie) or at least a two
fold duty, and divers function or ministration thereof. One of such as are peculiarly appointed to the teaching of particular churches: Of whō see here before, in the fift Question pag, 259. The other of such, as doe either1 Sam. 19, 20. 2 King. 2, 3, 5 7, 15. and 4, 1. and 6, 1. and 9, 1. with Amos 7, 14. Luc. 2, 46. and Act. 5, 34. vvith 22.3. in the Schooles and universities interpret the Scriptures, & train up the students in Theologie; or doeDeut. 33, 8, 10. Nehem. 8, 1 — 8. 2 Chron. 17, 7, 8, 9. Prov. 1, 20, 21. and 8, 1, 2, 3. and 29, 18. Esa. 30, 10, 20, 21. and 57, 19. and 59, 21. Ier. 18, 18. Hos. 5, 9. and 7, 12. Amos 2, 12. and 7, 12, 13. Mic. 3, 11. Ezech. 22, 25, 28. and 13, and 14 chap. Jer. 14.13. Mat. 5, 1, 2. and 9, 37, 38. and 13, 1, 2, 52. and 22, 35. and 23, 34. Luke 5, 17. Act. 13, 1, 15. and 15, 35. Rev. 11, 3. and 18, 24. vvith Act. 11, 19 — 24. Rom. 10, 14, 15, 17. 1 Cor. 12, 28, 29. and Ephes. 4, 11, 12. othervvhere privately and pub∣likly, in houses, streets, ships, armies, garrisons, or other assemblies, any where, instruct the people in Religion, and al duties of godlines, commō or speciall, as there is just occasion. Also, vvhether these Teachers should minister the Lords supper, is vvithal to be considered and examined by the Scriptures: Seeing the Le∣vites in Israell vvere not suffered to come to the Altar or holy things of God, no nor to flay the sacrifices, unlesse in a speciall case, when there were not Priests ynough. Num. 18, 3. and 3, 10. and Levit. 1, 6. vvith 2 Chron. 29, 34. Which is the more to be noted, because the Levites vvere by the ordinance of God, joyned to the Priests, in the Ministerie of the Lords house, and for teaching Israell the Lavv of God, &c. who yet notwith∣standing might not doe all things perteyning to the Priests office, Numb. 18, 2, 3. and Ezech. 44, 13, 14, 15, 16. with Num. 3, 5 — 10. &c. and 16 chap. By vvhich also appeareth, that some Ministers may be imployed in some works of the Ministerie: vvho yet notwithstanding may not lavvfully do all things that perteine to the holy ministration, and to some other Offi∣ces appointed thereunto. And that the Pastors & Teachers now are an∣svverable to the Priests and Levites in Israell, vvas noted before out of Esa. 66, 21. compared vvith Ephes. 4, 11, 12. As touching the election or calling of these Teachers: I spake here be∣fore of the calling of those which are of the former sort, as touching their choise to particular congregations: as may be seen in the third Question, pag. 252, &c. Now touching the calling of the Teachers of the latter sort, whether they be such as are Professors in Vniversities, or others that are not tyed to any particular churches, I leaue it to be considered & discus∣sed by the vvord of God, vvhether such be not sometimes raised up of God extraordinarily; or having an ordinarie calling may (upon speciall occasion) be sent out by Princes (as of old was done by Iehoshaphat king of Iudah;) or be called and allovved to teach by the Vniversities and Go∣vernors thereof, or designed by particular churches; or approved by the Pastors and Presbyteries of one or moe churches; or by some other good and lawfull meanes be admitted & appointed, to the performance of the duties aforesaid, according to the rules and examples had in the
vvord of God. 1 King. 19, 16. Amos 7, 14, 15. Mat. 9, 36, 37, 38. and 21, 23, 25, 34, 36. Luke 1.17. 2 Chron. 17.7.8.9. Sal. Song 8.1.2. or 8.9. Acts 8.4.14.26 and 11.19.22. and 13.1.2.3. 1 Tim. 4.14. with 2 Tim. 1.6. and 2.2. Revel. 11.3.4.10. and 18.24. Some writeM. Brou. on Rev. 11. p. 108. 109 that among the Ievves, such as vvere taken to be Doctors (or Teachers) for to teach the people, were first held to be very learned: and that then some of the Sanedrin laid their hands upon such a one, and said, Rabbi, take thou authoritie to teach, what is bound, and vvhat is loose. Maymon. in Sanedrin. And then might Christ vvell haue reference thereunto, Mat. 16, 19. and John 20, 23. Which point I thought good here to note downe, and to leaue it to further observation: As also, vvhether some like course may not or should not still be used, for the orderly calling of Teachers and ministers, to the office and work of the ministerie, in the time of the Gospell. And finally, vvhat may be intended by those words of the Prophet, vvhere Esay prophecying of the time of the Gospell, and calling of the Gentiles, bringeth in the Lord speaking thus, And I will also take of them (of the Gentiles) for Priests and for Levites, saith the Lord. &c. Esa. 66.21, 22. Where all the vvords are vvell to be observed, when he saith, And also; I will take saith the Lord, of the Gentiles; for Priests and for Levites. &c. For in deed the Lord himself took the Priests and Levites (out of the tribes of Israel) to be the ministers of the Sanctuarie, and to minister therein still on, age after age, one after another, untill the time of correction at Christs comming. Exod. 28 and 29. Lev. 8. and 9. Numb. 8. Deut. 10.8. and 33.8 — 11. 1 Chron. 15, 2, 3,— 24. 2 Chron. 29.4 — 11. with Heb. 9.6 — 10. &c. (Whereas the ruling Elders and Governors vvere then at first appointed to be chosen by the people. Deut. 1.9.13. and 16.18.) And vvhat also by the Apostles speach, vvhen spea∣king likevvise of the ministeriall offices of the Gospell, he saith, that Christ ascending up on high, gaue gifts unto men: And that he gaue some, Apostles; & some, Prophets; and some, Euangelists: and some Pastors, and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministerie, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come into the unitie of the faith, and of the knovvledge of the Sonne of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulnes of Christ. Ephes. 4.11.12.13. (Where likewise there is no mention of the ruling Elders, as not being appointed for the vvork of the ministerie, and being also before plainly ynough and sufficiently designed in the Elders of the church of Israell. But the speach here, is onely of the ministers of the Gospell:) vvhere again al the words are to be observed, both touching the giver (Christ himself) ver. 1, and 11. and the severall offices of ministerie giuen, ver. 11. & the use, ver. 12. vvith the durance and continuance of them. ver. 13. For although the offices of the Apostles, Prophets, and Euagelists, be not novv in any particular mens persons, as they were then: yet the fruit of them abideth still, and is perpetuall, in their writings and labors, in the foundation layd once for all, and in the plantation of the churches, according to the ordi∣nance of Christ. Mat. 28.18.19.20. John 15.16. 1 Cor. 3.10.11. and 4.9.10. Eph.
2, 20. and 3, 5, 6, 7. and 4, 8 — 13. 1 Tim. 3, 1 — 15. and 6, 13, 14. 2 Tim. 2, 2. Rev. 21, 14, 19, 20. And the offices of Pastors and Teachers (answerable to the Priests and Levites in Israell, Esa. 66, 21. Ier. 33, 18 — 22.) are still to endure in the church, for the work of the ministerie, age after age, to the end of the vvorld. And vvhether therefore the Lord hath not still preserved his ministerie, though corrupted (as he hath also done his seale of Baptisme) through the corruptest times: & that ordinarily such a calling should al∣vvay be had thereunto of al Pastors and Teachers, as we may be assured, it is derived from Christ himself, by the Apostles, Euangelists, and other ministers of Christ, from the beginning, unto this day: and shall likewise still be continued untill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ. Ephes. 4, 11, 12, 13. compared with Esa. 66, 21, 22. and 59, 21. Jer. 33, 18 — 22. and vvith Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. Act. 14, 23. and 20, 17, 28. 1 Tim. 3, 1 — 15. and 5, 22. and 6, 13, 14. 2 Tim. 2, 2.

Touching the exercise of Prophecy. VVHether in the churches (vvhere there are men indued vvith fitte gifts) there should not be had the exercise of Prophecy, for in∣terpreting of the Scriptures, disputing of points of religion, propoun∣ding of objections, ansvvering of questions fitly and needfully made, and such other good uses profitable for the church, and the edification there∣of in the truth, vvhich is according to godlines. And this exercise also to be done, not onely by the Ministers of the vvord,Specially, such as employ themselues in the study of the Scriptures. but by others also ha∣ving gifts, that are fit and able thereunto. Yet alvvaies so, as al things be done decently and in order. Rom. 12.6. and 1 Thes. 5, 20. compared vvith 1 Cor. 12, 7. and 14 chap. Luke. 2, 46, 47. with Ioh. 7, 14, 15. 1 Pet. 4, 10, 11. 2 Tim. 2, 2, 15, 16, 23. vvith Act. 15, 1, 2, 6, 7 — 22.32. and 17, 2, 3. and 18, 4, 26. and 19, 8, 9, 10. Mat. 13, 52. Also 1 Sam. 10, 5, 10, 12. and 19, 20, 21, 23. 2 King. 2, 3, 5, 7. and 4, 38. and 5, 22. and 6, 1. Amos 7, 14. with 1 Cor. 14, 1 — 40. 1. Because this order and exercise vvas in Israell, and in the primitiue churches. Luke 2, 46, 47. Act. 17, 1, 2, 3. and 18, 1, 4, 24, 26. and 19, 1, 8, 9, 10. vvith Rom. 12, 6. 1 Cor. 12, 7. and 14 ch. 1 Thes. 5, 19, 20. 1 Tim. 1, 3, 4. and 2 Tim. 2, 16, 23. Tit. 3, 9. 1 Pet. 4, 10, 11. 2. The Apostles do often in their Epistles require of the churches the carefull using hereof. As vvhen Paul saith to the Romanes. Having then gifts, differing according to the grace that is giuen us, vvhether Prophecy, let us prophe∣cy according to the proportion of faith: Or ministerie, let us be in our ministration, &c. Rom. 12.6.7.8. Where the Apostle teaching the divers use of mens gifts, shevveth that they may be used eyther out of office, in prophecy, so as we
prophecy according to proportion of faith; or in office and ministerie, eyther in teaching, or in exhorting, distributing, ruling, & shewing mercy. Like∣wise in the Epistle to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 14 chap. where though the Apostle speak of extraordinarie gifts, as he doth also before, in 1 Cor. 13.2. yet notvvithstanding from thence by due proportion and consequence, may the use also of ordinarie gifts well be gathered: and many things in that chapter lead thereunto. As vvhen the Apostle saith: Follow after loue, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophecy. He that prophecyeth, speaketh unto men, to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. &c. 1 Cor. 14.1.3. &c. And in the Epistle to the Thessalonians: Quench not the spirit: despise not prophesyings: Proue all things: hold that which is good. 1 Thes. 5.19.20.21. The Apostle Peter also in his Epistle saith: As every man hath received the gift, euen so minister the same one to another, as good stevvards of the manifold grace of God. If any speak, in him speak as the oracles of God: if any man minister, let him doe it as of the abilitie which God giueth, that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ: to whē be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 1 Pet. 4, 10, 11. 3. Els the diversities of gifts in men, are not knowen, nor used, as they might be: and other mens gifts are quenched, saue the ministers onely; or at least they are not so used for the profit of others, as vvell they might. Which is against the use and end, for which they are giuen: which is, for to profit withall: as the Apostle teacheth. 1 Cor. 12.4.7. and to find out & hold that which is good. 1 Thes. 5, 19, 20, 21. For which cause also the Apo∣stle required both of Timothee & Titus, to represse such as should teach corrupt doctrine, and to restraine foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the Law, and vvhatsoever tended not to edifying, but was unprofitable and vaine. 1 Tim. 1, 3 — 7. and 6, 20. 2 Tim. 2, 16, 23. Tit. 3.9. Which should alwaies carefully be looked unto, by the Mini∣sters and Overseers of the church. CHAPTER IX. Touching the ministration of the Sacraments to all persons generally. VVHether the Sacraments should be ministred to such as stand ob∣stinate in knowen iniquitie, until they repent: eitherMat. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. and 28, 18, 19, 20. Luke 7, 29, 30. Act. 2, 37, 38, 39.

Lev. 7.20.21. and 13.45.46. and 22.25. and 24.5.6.7. Numb. 5, 2, 3. and 9, 7, 14. & 19, 22. 2 Chro. 29, and 30, and 34, and 35 ch. vvith 1 Cor. 5, 6 — 13. 2 Cor. 6, 14 — 18. Lords Supper. 1. Seeing they are the seales of Gods everlasting covenant of grace
made vvith the faithfull and their seed, and pledges of the righteousnes and salvation which is by fayth in Iesus Christ. For which, see the Scri∣ptures here before alledged. 2. Our Sacraments are ansvverable to theirs in Israell. And neyther the straungers uncircumcised might eat of the Passeover; nor the Israe∣lites in apostasie, til they repented; nor the uncleane, til they were clean∣sed. Exod. 12, 43, 45, 48. Lev. 7, 20, 21. and 22, 25. 2 Chron. 29. and 30, 5. &c. and 34, and 35. with 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7. 2 Cor. 6, 14 — 18. 3. Els the Table of the Lord and his holy things should not be regar∣ded, as they ought to be. Mal. 1, 7, 12. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 21. and 5, 6 — 13. Lev. 22, 25. and 24, 6, 7. 4. And the giving of the seales of Gods grace and righteousnes, to the knovven open vvicked, being still unrepentant, might thus far forth be∣come a justifying of them, and promising life unto them in their estate, & an hardening of their hearts and strengthning of their hands the more in their evill vvaies: besides the defiling of our selues and the holy things of God, that might also come thereby. Prov. 17, 15. and 24, 24. Esa. 5, 23. Ezec. 13, 22. Mal. 2, 17. Hag 2, 14, 15. Numb. 5, 2, 3. and 19, 22. Deut. 24, 8, 9. Iosh. 7, 1, 2 — 13. and 22, 20. 1 Cor. 5, 6 — 13. 2 Cor. 6, 14 — 18. 5. As touching the children, that are baptized by the church, they are thus all members thereof, and ought accordingly to be esteemed, and (vvhat in us is) should be brought up, as an holy seed, in the awe and in∣formation of the Lord. Gen. 17, 1, 7, 9, 12, 23. with chap. 18, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 7, 14. and 12, 12, 13. Psal. 22, 30, 31. Prov. 22, 6. and 30, 1, 26, 28. Matth. 28, 18, 19, 20. Mar. 10, 13 — 16. Ephes. 6, 4. 2 Ioh. ver. 4. If it be said here, that all Israell was circumcised, euen the Apostate Is∣raelites of the ten tribes: I graunt both that it was so: and that they did wel in that they reteyned circumcision, as they did also1 Kin. 21 3. 2 King. 7, 3. Hos. 2 11. Amo 8, 5, 10. other of the or∣dinances prescribed by God: yet notwithstanding they sinned greatly vvithall, in that they adulterated those ordinances of God, and corrupted themselues with Idolatries and superstitions, &c. Such as novv also is the estate of the church of Rome and other the like apostate churches, who doe vvell in reteyning of Baptisme and other ordinances of the Lord, vvhich they doe notwithstanding otherwise very sinfully corrupt and ad∣ulterate, &c. Of vvhich see here before in the first Treatise, ch. 3. p. 27. &c. Here also let us search, whether it was lawfull for the tribe of Iudah & such of the Iewes as walked faithfully vvith God, to circumcise the chil∣dren of the apostate Israelites or the like, and then to leaue them to their idolatrous parents to be brought up: when their parents would not cō∣municate in the Passeover, and leaue their idolatrie, &c. Hos. 11.12. And hereabout see the histories of Hezekiah and Iosiah Kings of Iudah, who first purged the Temple, and removed publike Idolatrie, and then after∣vvard celebrated the Passeover. 2 Chron. 29. and 30. and 34. and 36 ch. 2 King. 23 ch. And consider herewithall the lavv touching the Proselytes, Exo. 12, 8, &c.
But on the other hand also (for the better finding out of the truth) let us obserue, whether the children of those that were uncleane in Israell, Lepers or others, vvere not to be circumcised the eight day, notwithstan∣ding the parents uncleannes, aswell as other children among them. Gen. 17, 12, 14. Lev. 12, 2, 3. Joh. 7, 22, 23. with 2 King 5, 27. 2 Chron. 26, 21. Lev. 13, 3. and 15, 2. Numb. 5, 2, 3, 4. and 19, 11. Deut. 24, 8, 9. And whether the fact of Christ receiving and blessing the litle children, which were brought unto him that he might put his hands upon them, and pray: will not also war∣rant us to receiue and baptise the litle children of Christians, that are brought unto us, to be baptised, and to be prayed for, or blessed: Speci∣ally considering that Christ was displeased at his disciples, vvho would haue hindered it, and said unto them: Suffer litle children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdome of God. Where that speciall reason alledged by Christ, and ground whereupon he did it, is in like sort wel to be observed. Mat. 19, 13, 14, 15. Mar. 10, 13 — 16. Luke 18, 15, 16. Of vvhich also, upon other occasion, I haue spoken here before, in the first Treatise, chap. 1. pag. 22, 23. CHAPTER X. Touching the manner of the administration of the Sacraments: Also, touching the Crosse in Baptisme, and kneeling at the Lords Supper, &c. VVHether the Sacraments ought not to be administred and recei∣ved, according to the simplicity of the Gospel, without any vain inventions of men, or corrupt abuses thereabout. Exod. 20, 4, 5, 6. with Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. and 1 Cor. 11, 23 — 26. 2 Cor. 11, 3. Lev. 10, 1. Esa. 1, 12. Heb. 12, 25, 26 — 29. Gal. 3, 15. Col. 2, 23. 2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. Rev. 22, 18, 19. 1. Because els there is transgression of the commandement and ordi∣nance of God. Exod. 20, 4, 5, 6. with Mat. 28, 19, 20. and 1 Cor. 11, 23, 24, 25. 2. And the Lord is thereby provoked to vvrath, and stirred up to pu∣nish such transgression. Exod. 20, 5. with 1 Cor. 11, 20, 30. Lev. 10, 1, 2, 3. 1 Chr. 13, 9, 10. Psal. 119, 21, 101, 113.128. Ezech. 23, 41 — 49. and 43, 7, 8. Mal. 2, 1 — 9. 3. The people of God are bound, in the administration of the Sacra∣ments, asvvell as in other dueties of the service of God, to worship  onely according as himself hath prescribed in his word:Lincol. Mi∣nisters A∣brid. excep. 2. arg. 2. Survey of the Book of common praier, Qu. 99. p. 97. 98. and therefore to renounce and forsake al superstition and idolatrous inventions of men in Gods vvorship: al humane ceremonies of mystical signification: al parts and parcels of the Beasts mark whatsoever; and carefully to keepe the commandements of God, and faith of Iesus Christ. Exo. 20, 4, 5, 6. with Rev. 14, 9 — 12. and 18, 4. and 22, 18, 19. 2 Cor. 6, 17. Ephes. 5, 11. Esa. 30, 22. Psal. 119, 101, 113, 128. Mat. 15, 7, 8, 9. 4. Thus shall vve also follovv the example of the godly and faithfull servants of God, that haue ben before us. 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2. and 11, 1, 2, 23. Gal. 1. 10, 11, 12. Num. 9, 1 — 5. Exod. 39, 43. with Heb. 3.1.2. Ioh. 12.49.50. Luke 1.5.6.
8.9. 1 Tim. 6.13.14. 2 Pet. 1.16. &c. 5. Els it should argue the Scriptures to be insufficient for directing the church in the use and ministration of the holy things of God. Contrary to 2 Tim. 3.16.17. 1 Cor. 4.1.2. 1 Tim. 3.15. and 6.3.13.14. with Exod. 20.4.5.6. 6. Finally, what end els would there be in the Church, of mens pre∣cepts, nevv administrations, strange vvorship, voluntarie religion, Anti∣christian apostasie, &c. Esa 29.13. Mat. 15.9. Col. 2.8.18.22.23. 2 Thes. 2.3.4. with Num. 15, 38, 39, 40. Deut. 4, 2. and 12.32. Hereby then may appeare, hovv corrupt the use is of the signe of the crosse in baptisme; of kneeling and uncovering the head at the Lords supper, in the act of receiving; of reading prayers out of a book, at the ministration of the Sacraments, and the like things; which the Scripture prescribeth not, but men haue taken up of themselues; thus breaking the second commandement, and joyning their posts and thresholds with the Lords. Exod. 20, 4, 5, 6. with Lev. 10.1. Deu. 12, 32. Psal. 119.128. 2 King. 16.10.11 — 16. Ezech. 43, 7, 8. Mar. 7, 3 — 9. Col. 2.18.22.23. Besides that thus men are dravven from the simplicitie and synceritie of the practise, used by Christ and his Apostles, vvho sate when they eate and drank, and did not then uncover their heads any more then before; neyther made a crosse vvhen they baptised, nor read their prayers out of books, &c. Mat. 26, 20. &c. and 28, 18.19.20. with 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 23. &c. And finally, that these are parte of the reliques & monuments yet remayning, of the apostasie of Antichrist the man of sinne. Which there∣fore ought to be refused and witnessed against by word and deed. 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. Whereof I need not vvrite more particularly, but onely leaue the Reader to apply the former reasons and the like, to these and other such corruptions yet reteyned among them. Concerning which, they that vvould see more, may read the treatises that haue ben heretofore purposely vvritten hereabout: Namely, M. Par∣kers Scholasticall discourse against Symbolizing with Antichrist in ceremonies: especial∣ly in the signe of the crosse. Where (in ten several chapters) he treateth of the breach of all the Ten commandements thereby. Also, A litle treatise touching kneeling at the Lords Supper, in the act of receiving. Moreover, The Trial of subscription: And, The Lincolne Ministers Abridgment of the reasons why they re∣fuse Subscription and Conformitie. The Survey of the Book of common prayer. And M. Greenvvoods and other treatises of book-prayer. About vvhich also, see here before, chap. 1. pag. 245. &c. CHAPTER XI. Of the disposing, blessing, breaking, distributing of the bread and wine. VVHether vve should not (at the celebration of the Lords Supper) set the bread and cup upon a Table, & so with thanksgiving first
blesse the bread, and then break it in the sight of the church, and so distri∣bute it being broken: and then after the distribution thereof to all the communicants, to take the cup also, and to blesse and distribute it in like sort. 1 Cor. 10.16.21. and 11.20— 34. Mat. 26, 26, 27. with Lev. 24.5 — 9. Ezech. 44.15.16. 1. Because at the first celebration and institution of the Lords Supper this order vvas observed: as vve may see, Mat. 26.26.27. Mark. 14, 22, 23. Luke 22.19, 20. with Mat. 28, 20. And the same maner also kept by the Apo∣stles afterward: as may be gathered, by that vvhich is written, 1 Cor. 10, 16, 21. and 11.23 — 26. 2. The breaking of the bread, doth not onely serue for the distributi∣on thereof, but is also a liuely representation of the death of Christ, which we shew forth in the participation thereof. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17. & 11, 24, 26. with Mat. 26, 26. Mar. 14, 22. Luke 22, 19. 3. Such placing of the bread and vvine upon a Table, and the distribu∣tion of them there accordingly made, vve may also learne by the very terme of a Table, and the common use thereof. Paul calleth it a Table, not an altar, forme, or deske: and opposeth it to the Idolaters Table, on which they were woont to set their meat and drink. 1 Cor. 10, 21. with ver. 19, 20, 28. Hitherto also may be referred the use of the Table in the Ta∣bernacle, on which the Shevv bread continually was set before the Lord. Exod. 25, 23 — 30. Lev, 24, 5 — 9. 4. And for the thanksgiving to be made both at the blessing of the bread, & the wine, it is plainly expressed. Mat. 26, 26, 27. & Mar. 14, 22, 23. CHAPT. XII. Touching the Ministers communicating with the rest of the Church. VVHether the Minister himself (that administreth the Lords supper) should not also partake vvith the church, communicating toge∣ther therein. Mat. 26, 17 — 29. Act. 20, 7 — 11. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17. and 11, 23 — 26. and 12, 12, 13. with 2 Chron. 35, 3 — 14. 1. Because Christ himself did so, communicating vvith his disciples both in the Passeover, and in the Supper follovving. Mat. 26, 17 — 29. with Luke 22, 15, &c. 2. So also did the Priests and Levites at the celebration of the Passeo∣ver, vvhereunto the Lords supper with us is answerable. 2 Chron. 35, 3 — 14. with 1 Cor. 5, 7. and 10, 16. and 11, 23 — 26. And the Fathers of families, at the first celebration of the Passeover, Exod. 12, 3. &c. And the Apostles at the celebration of the Lords supper, Act. 20, 7 — 11. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17. 3. And Christ our Lord hath thus commanded, saying, Drinke ye all of this, Mat. 26, 27. And againe, Doe this in remembrance of me. 1 Cor. 11, 24, 25.
4. The nature also of the thing it self, and the reasons vvhich are an∣nexed to the commandement of Christ, concerning the celebration of the Lords supper, comprehend and bynd the Minister himself, asvvell as the other members of the church, to the participation thereof. As name∣ly, that it is a signe and seale of the remission of sinnes obteyned for us by the death of Iesus Christ. Mat. 26, 26, 27, 28. And, that thus we should shevv forth the Lords death, till he come. 1 Cor. 11, 23 — 26. And, that it is called the Eucharist, or thankesgiving, because we doe now giue thanks un∣to God for our redemption wrought by the death of Iesus Christ, & thus confirmed unto us through his grace. Luke 22, 19. 1 Cor. 10, 16. and 11, 24. with Psal. 116, 12, 13, 14. &c. 5. And the minister himself is together with the rest a member of the church and body of Christ: the communion vvhereof is here also cele∣brated. Rom. 12, 3 — 8. compared with 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17. and 12, 12, 13, 18, 27, 28. Othervvise also we had need take heed, that there be not in deed a schisme or rent made in that Church, (& so in the body of Christ) where this order is not observed. Like as came to passe in that other case, where of the Apostle vvriteth to the church of Corinth, 1 Cor. 11.18. &c. CHAPT. XIII. Touching the Ruling Elders, Deacons, or common people, ministring the Sacraments. VVHether it be right and lawful for the Ruling Elders, Deacons, or private people out of office, not being Ministers of the word, to administer the Sacraments: or at the Lords supper in the delivery of the bread and wine, to blesse them; and to say to each of the communicants severally, Take thou, and eat, &c. or, Take thou, and drink, &c. Matth 26, 26, 27. with 1 Cor 4, 1. and 10, 16. Ephes. 4, 11, 12. Esa. 66, 21. Ier. 33.18.21.

Seeing that the Ministers of Christ, are the household stevvards and dispensers of the mysteries of God, the ambassadours of Christ, and la∣bourers together with him. 1 Cor. 4, 1. with 3, 5, 9. and 2 Cor. 5, 20. Luke 12.42. Rev. 2.1. with Mal. 2, 7. Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. 2. At the first celebration of the Lords supper, Christ himself (the Apo∣stle and high Priest of our profession) did minister it: and giving thanks blessed the bread & wine, & distributed them both, among his disciples, saying to them all together at once, Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye, &c. Hebr. 3, 1. with Mat. 26, 26.27. Mar. 14, 22, 23. Luke 22, 19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.23. &c. 3. And the ministration of the Sacraments, and blessing of the bread and wine, is a vvork of the ministerie. Mat. 28.18.19.20. and 1 Cor. 10, 16. with Ephes. 4, 11, 12. Act. 20, 7. &c. 4. TheHow the other Pris∣byters or El∣ders that are Ministers o spoken of in aunci∣ent writers) may admi∣nister the sa∣craments, & as some think, Ba∣ptisme more specially: here I treat not: But wish that the right may be sought out, and rightly observed. ruling Elders of the Christian church (of vvhom I speak) are
such as are answerable to those Elders in the church of Israel, which were calledAs being chosen out of the peo∣ple, by the people, and for the peo∣ple. &c. The Elders of the people, or the Rulers of the Synagogues, &c. and vvere distinct from the other ministers, Priests, and Levites, vvhich ministred the vvord and holy things of God in Israell. 1 Tim. 5, 17. and Rom. 12.7.8. with Jer. 19.1. Act. 13.15. and 18.8.17. and Deut. 33.8.10. Esa. 66.21. 2 Chron. 13.10.11. Whereupon Ambrose saithAmbr. in 1. Tim. 5. Both the (Ievvish) Synagogue, and after∣ward the church (of the Christians) had Elders, without whose counsell nothing was done in the church. The which by what negligence it is out of use, I know not, unlesse it be by the sloth, or rather pride of the Teachers, whiles they alone vvill seeme to be some∣vvhat. But now these Elders being (by the mercy of God) recovered again, and had in many of the reformed churches, it is for them carefully to at∣tend upon their ovvn office and function; assisting the Pastors and mini∣sters of Christ in the ministration & government of the church, & pro∣curing (vvhat in them is) the good order, peace, and benefit of the whole church, and of all the members thereof: but stil leaving to the Pastors & other ministers, the works of the ministerie perteyning unto them: that so all may performe and fulfill their ovvne offices and ministeries, accor∣ding to the rule of the word of God. 1 Tim. 5.17. vvith Act. 20, 17, 28.

The Lords supper also is ansvverable to the Passeover & sacrifices: vvhich (after the building of the Tabernacle) were offred by the Priests, and not by the Elders of the people. 1 Cor. 5.7.8. vvith 2 Chron. 13.10, 11. and 35.2 — 15. also Ier. 19.1. and Esa. 66.21.23. But note, that here I speak not of the praeparation and other service, vvhich is attributed to the Levites; concerning vvhich, see 2 Chron. 35.2 — 15. That may vvell haue an other consideration, vvhich in a good manner may be referred to the work of the Deacons, vvho novv make ready and prepare al things necessarie for the Lords Supper, and after the blessing or consecration made by the Pa∣stor, doe in some churches receiue the bread and wine of him, and deli∣ver it unto the communicants, that all things in the church may be done decently and in order. Whereabout also obserue that vvhich is written, Act. 6, 2, 3. with 1 Cor. 14.40. and 2 Chron. 35, 2 — 15. and vvhat by good con∣sequence and proportion may be gathered and inferred thereupon. 6. And touching the Deacons office it self, note also how it is distinct from the office of the ministers of the vvord: so as the Apostles thought it not to be meet or reason, that they should attend to the duties thereof, together vvith their ministerie: but that others should be appointed to that function: & that they vvould giue themselues continually to prayer, and to the ministerie of the word. Act. 6.2.4. And thus also the offices of the Ministers, Deacons, and Elders, are reckned as distinct, by the Apostle Paul, Rom. 12.7.8. 7. Moreover, the Lord hath joyned the administration of the Sacra∣ments vvith the ministerie of the word. Mat. 28.18.19.20. Act. 20.7.11. 1 Cor. 3.5.9. vvith 10.16. Novv what God hathviz. In the same per∣sons, and things, and in the ordi∣narie admi∣nistration, &c. joyned together, let not
man put asunder: as Christ taught in another case. Mar. 10.9. And on the contrarie, what God hath set asunder, let not man joyne together. Numb. 16.9.10. and 18.1 — 7. vvith Esa. 66.21. Ezech. 44.19. and 46.20. 1 Tim. 5.17. 8. Here also may be considered, how God was sore displeased at Co∣rah, though he vvere a Levite; and at Dathan and Abiram, with their com∣pany, though they vvere Princes of the assemblie, famous in the Congre∣gation, and men of renovvne; also at Vzziah, though he were a King; vvhen they vvould haue offred incense upon the altar before the Lord: vvhich God had layd upon the Priests. Numb. 16 ch. 2 Chron. 26, 16. &c. 9. Finally, a man can receiue or take nothing unto himself, except it be giuen him from heauen. Ioh. 3, 27. and 1, 25, 33. And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. Heb. 5, 4, 5. Accordingly doe the old and nevv Writers teach, about the ministra∣tion of the Sacraments and other holy things of God in the church, that difference should stil be kept, betvveen the Ministers & the people. Their testimonies I need not note in particular: they are so wel knowen. One∣ly see more specially Polanus on Ezech. 43, 18 — 27. pag. 785. 787. And Pisca∣tor also, and Iunius: vvho vvrite, that to consecrate the people to minister unto God, whereunto God appointed the Levites onely, were against the right worship of God, and a perverting of all order. Piscat. Schol. in Ezech. 44, 19. Juniij Annotat. in Ezech. 46, 20. CHAPTER XIIII. Touching the often celebrating of the Lords supper: And of the time of the day, whether in the morning or euening, &c. VVHether it be not best and most agreeable to the vvill of God, to celebrate the Lords supper often, and (vvhere it can vvell be) everie Lords day: besides the churches cōtinual serving & worshiping of God daily. 1 Cor. 11, 23 — 26. and 10, 16, 17, 18. compared with Act. 20, 7. and Esa. 66, 23. with Exod. 20.8 — 13. Rev. 1, 10. Ezech. 44, 15, 16, 24. and 45, 17 — 25. & 46 chap. Numb. 28, 9, 10. Act. 2, 42.46. and 3, 1. and 26, 7. 1 Thes. 5, 17, 18. 1. Because the Apostle teacheth, that Christ at the first celebration thereof, said, This doe ye, as oft as ye drinke it, in remembrance of me: And there∣upon inferreth, As often as ye eat this bread and drinke this cup, ye doe shewe the Lords death till he come. 1 Cor. 11, 25, 26. Which plainly implyeth the often ob∣servation thereof, in remembrance of Christ, and his death. 2. Thus also the Apostles and Churches at first used to doe: as may appeare by the Apostles vvords aforesaid, 1 Cor. 11, 26. and by that which is vvritten, Act. 20, 6, 7. Where it is said, that Paul abiding at Troas seuen daies, upon the first day of the vveeke, vvhen the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, &c. Where it appeareth, that their comming together to break bread (that is, to celebrate the Lords supper) was on the first day of the week, that is, on the Lords day. Which likevvise is expresly noted byWho lived about 150 yeres after Christ. Iustine Martyr, in his second Apologie: vvhere he saith, On Sunday, as
it is called, there is a comming together in one place of all that dwel either in the tovvne or in the countrey. And there is read the commentaries of the Apostles and Writings of the Prophets, as time vvill suffer. Then the Reader ceasing,Ho proe∣stos. the Praesident maketh a speach, vvherein he instructeth the people, and exhorteth them to the imitation of such excellent things. Aftervvard vve rise up all together, and povvre out prayers: and (as I sayde before) bread and vvine andEuen by this time, corruptions began to creep in: as by this and other parti∣culars here and other∣where may appeare. vvater is brought: and the President likevvise povvreth out prayers and thanksgiving vvith all the might he can: and the people har∣tily speak out together, saying, Amen. And then to everie one that is present is there made distribution & communication of those things that vvere blessed, on vvhich thanks vvere giuen before: and to those that are absent some is sent by the Deacons. &c. Iust. Martyr. Apolog. 2. Edit. Commel. Graeco-lat. pag. 76.77. A remainder of vvhich practise, for celebration of the Lords supper every Lords day, as also of the dayly vvorship of God (and of some other like things good to be ob∣served) may be seen in the Cathedrall churches at this day: though with corruptions othervvise. 3. The nature end & use of the Lords supper may likevvise lead here∣unto: inasmuch as it is the sacrament of our continuall nourishment and comfort in the church by Iesus Christ: as baptisme is of our once entring thereinto: And is also the memorial of the death of Christ, which he suf∣fred for our sinnes: and should therefore stil be remembred, and often ce∣lebrated of us with thankesgiving. According as Christ himself hath taught, saying: Doe this in remembrance of me: and again, This doe ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 1 Cor. 11, 24, 25. By which meanes our faith is the more strengthned, our hope increased, our mutuall loue nourished, and vve still stirred up, with all thankfulnes to ascribe unto God the praise of our salvation in Iesus Christ. In vvhich respect also it may fitly be cal∣led the Eucharist or Thankesgiving. 1 Cor. 10.16 — 18. and 11.23 — 26. compared vvith Mat. 26.26.27.28. Mar. 14.22 — 25. Luke 22.19.20. Act. 2.41.42. and 20.7. vvith Numb. 28.9.10. Ezech. 44.15.16. 4. And note here, hovv the Papists and Lutherans doe much urge, (though diversly) the having of Images, for the better remembrance of Christ, and to be in stead of books for the unlearned people, &c. where∣as Christ hath appointed himself to be described, and his people to be taught and put in remembrance of him, not by Images, but by his Gospel and Sacraments: Mar. 16.15. Gal. 3.1.8. Mat. 26.28. and 28.18.19.20. 1 Cor. 10.16. and 11.23 — 26. And therewithall let it be observed, whether that Images vvere not then most of all brought into the churches and private houses, under the pretences aforesaid, vvhen the diligent teaching of the Gospell, and often celebration of the Lords Supper, did by degrees de∣cay and cease more and more in the parishionall churches among the people. So as the Ministers becomming themselues dumbe, non resident, or slothfull, the Images (though also dumbe) vvere made to supply their place, being novv set up to be the peoples teachers and remembrancers another way, in stead of the liuely preaching of the vvord, & careful ob∣servation of the Lords supper; for the continuall shevving forth and me∣moriall
of his death from time to time. Which therefore may the more stirre up the churches (novv being reformed) not onely to abandon the foresaid Images, but also diligently to use both the preaching of the Gos∣pel, & often communicating at the Lords Table, the better to meet with the corruptions of later times, and to returne to the intier practise of the churches that vvere in former ages. 5. Furthermore, the Lords supper (being rightly considered) is answe∣rable not onely to the Passeover, but to the other Feasts also and sacrifices had at Ierusalem: And the Prophets speaking of the times of the Gospel, (under the termes of the shadovves of the Lavv) foretold that from one Nevv moone to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh should come to vvor∣ship before the Lord, at Jerusalem, &c. Which by the practise aforesaid care∣fully observed, vve may performe and enjoy in Christ, who is the truth & body of all those types and shadovves. And how othervvise it is or can outwardly be performed aright, and ansvverably to the prophecies and shadowes aforesaid, should by al churches heedfully be observed. Esa. 66.23. Ezec. 44.15.16.24. and 45, 18 — 25. and 46, 1 — 11. Zach. 14, 16 — 19. vvith Col. 2.16.17. Act. 2.42. and 20, 7. Rev. 1, 10. 1 Cor. 10.16 — 18. and 11.23 — 26. Be∣sides that the Lords day, and the Lords supper at the Lords Table, doe fitly agree together both for the termes, and for the things themselues, thus spoken of Rev. 1.10. compared vvith 1 Cor. 10.16.17.21. and 11.20. and Act. 20.7. Another question there is, about the time of the day, vvhen the Lords supper should be celebrated, vvhether in the morning or euening, &c. Some think, it should be in the euening or after noone, because Christ at first with his disciples did eat it at euen, after the Passeover, vvhereup∣on it vvas called the Lords supper. Touching which, on the other hand, may these reasons be observed, and the like. 1. That the having of it then at euen, vvas upon speciall occasion; be∣cause it follovved the celebration of the Passeover, which was kept at euen. Which occasion ceasing, the time is left free: Christ having not ap∣pointed it, or any set time thereunto. Mat. 26.17 — 26. &c. 2. So Christ and his disciples eate it then with unleavened bread by the occasion aforesaid; and the feast of unleavened bread, then also ob∣served. Which now being ceased, as vve are not therefore bound to the use of unleavened bread, so neyther are vve bound to that circumstance of time, but may as freely use another time, as other common and usuall bread therein. Mat. 26, 17 — 26. Mar. 14, 12 — 22. vvith Exod. 12.8.15.18. &c Act. 2.42. and 20.7. 1 Cor. 10, 16. 3. In like manner, at the first celebration of the Passeover in Egypt, they eat it standing with staues in their hand, as ready to depart from thence: and sprinkled blood upon the lintell & side posts of their doores, keeping within, & not going out of their houses, because that night the Lord vvould passe through, to smite the Egyptians, and seeing the blood on their doore posts, would passe over them, and not destroy their first borne vvith the other. Exod. 12.7.11 — 13.22.13. Which occasions ceasing,
vvhen aftervvard they vvere in the land at rest, they eat it sitting, & sprin∣kled not their doore posts vvith blood, neyther vvere bound to keepe vvithin, but might goe out of their houses: as we read that Christ vvith his disciples sate dovvne to eat it, and then aftervvard went out of the house that night to the mount of Oliues, &c. Mat. 26, 19.20.30. This shew∣eth forth the Lords death already done: as those typed out his death then to come.4. Moreover, the Lords supper (as by other occasion I noted here be∣fore) is so to be considered, as not onely succeeding the Passeover, but as ansvvering also to the other Feasts and Sacrifices then had in Israell. Which were observed aswell in the morning, as at euening. Not to speak of the Shevv bread, still being on the pure Table, before the Lord: & o∣ther the like ordinances had in Israell. Which in the perpetuall equitie thereof, may haue their use: being hereunto fitly and vvisely applyed, ac∣cording to the proportion of faith. Ioh. 1, 29, 36. 1 Cor. 5, 7. and 10, 16, 17, 18. Luke 22, 7 — 20. compared vvith Lev. 1 — 7. and 23 chap. and 24, 5 — 9. Numb. 15, 1, 2 — 29. and 28 & 29 chap. Deut. 16, 1 — 17. Heb. 13, 8 — 16. Hos. 14.2. Mal. 1, 11. Zach. 14, 16 — 19. Esa. 66, 23. Rev. 13, 8. 5. Finally, the auncient practise of the churches of Christ, ever synce the Apostles times, confirmeth the same yet more unto us. As, when in the Acts of the Apostles it is vvritten, that upon the first day of the week, the disciples came together to break bread. Act. 20, 7. Where, in that he saith, they came together that day to this end, we must either think that they met but at euening for it, or grant that they had and might haue it at other times besides: Which Iustine Martyr makes manifest, whose words I no∣ted here before, besides the continuall practise of the Church ever since throughout all ages: vvhich is carefully to be regarded, in all such things as are not repugnant or disagreeing to the vvord of God. CHAPTER XV. Touching the having of a Fast, and the Lords supper, both together, in one day. VVHether it be meet and right, upon one and the same day, to haue a solemne Fast, together vvith the celebration of the Lords supper. Judg. 20, 26. Ester. 4, 16. compared with Mat. 26, 26 — 29. Act. 20, 7 — 11. 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, and 11, 23 — 26. 1. Because the nature of them both (to wit, of a Fast, and of the Lords Supper) is so very divers & differing the one from the other. Which may appear by their names, besides the nature of the things themselues. The one is a Fast, the other a Feast. In the one we absteyne from meat and drink: In the other vve doe eat and drink. Which also Christ himself hath cōmanded, saying, Take ye, eat ye, drinke ye, &c. And the one is a signe or solemne testification of sorrow, the other of joy. Judg. 20, 26. Ester. 4, 16. vvith Mat. 26.26 — 29. Luke 22.17 — 20. 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7, 8. Where also see & con∣sider that which is vvritten, Neh. 8, 10— 13.
2. The Lords supper succeedeth the Passeover, and is answerable unto it. At the celebration whereof the Lord required, that they should eate and drink in Israel. And not that they should fast, as in the day of Atone∣ment, wherein they were enjoyned to afflict their soules, and from euen to euen to celebrate their rest. Luc. 22, 7 — 20. 1 Cor. 5, 7. and 10, 16, 17. and 11, 23 — 26. and Exod. 12, 3 — 11. Deut. 16, 1 — 7. 2 Chron. 30, and 35 chap. and Psal. 116, 13. compared with Lev. 23, 5, 6, 27 — 32. and with Iudg. 20, 26. and Dan. 10, 2, 3, 22. And here note, that the Lords supper was celebrated of Christ to∣gether with his disciples, straightvvay after their eating of the Passeover. Which is a point likevvise to be observed in this behalf. Matth. 26, 17 — 30. Mar. 14, 12 — 26. Luke 22, 7 — 20. As also, that it is now in the Church the Christians feast, answerable (in some respects) to the sundry feasts obser∣ved among the Ievves. Act. 2, 42. and 20, 7. 1 Cor. 5, 7, 8. and 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 23 — 26. vvith Mar. 14, 22 — 26. 3. And all things in the church of God should be done decently & in order. 1 Cor. 14, 40. Now what order, or decency is there in this, that whiles and where a Feast is solemnely observed, there should bread and wine in the same assembly be set upon a publike Table, & all at the same time be enjoyned, to take, to eat, and to drink, &c. or that solemne Fasts and Feasts should be celebrated and joyned togethef, upon one and the same day? 4. Here moreover may be observed, how they were woont in the pri∣mitiue churches to haue loue-feasts, vvith the Lords supper: as by some Scriptures, and other vvriters may appeare. 1 Cor. 11, 20— 34. and Iude epist. ver. 12. Tertullian. Apolog. cap 39. Which then being so, may shevv how far this custome & practise differeth from that vvhich was used in the chur∣ches of old. Not to speak, hovv some in former times haue made questi∣on, whether the church might haue any Fasts upon the Lords day at all. Into vvhich point I vvill not novv enter: neither insist upon things, that in extraordinarie cases may be admitted. CHAPT. XVI. Touching Loue-feasts. VVHether it be good and lawfull, for the churches now, to haue & use Loue-feasts, at times convenient, and namely, on such dayes, vvhen they haue the Lords supper. Iude, epist. ver. 12. 1 Cor. 11, 20— 34. compared vvith Deut. 12, 5, 6, 7. and 16, 1 — 15. Touching vvhich, on the one hand, obserue these things following. 1. That so they practised in the primitiue Churches: as may appeare both by some speaches in the Scripture, Iude, ver. 12. 1 Cor. 11, 20— 34. and by the record of auncient writers, Clement, Tertullian, &c. 2. And note in Tertullian, how he sheweth, that they were kept in his time, which vvas about two hundred yeeres after Christ. And so long
then they had continued from the Apostles times there, vvhere Tertul∣lian lived. Tertullian. Apolog. cap. 39. 3. Now whence this practise first arose, I leaue further to be consider∣ed. Onely for the point in hand, this I note, that vvhether they did it for the better nourishing & continuing of loue & peace among themselues; or for the more comforting & refreshing of the poor by the richer sort, & together with them; or that they had therein respect to the action of Christ, who celebrated the Lords supper after the eating of the Passeover (Luke 22.7 — 20.) or that they took this custome (as they did many other things) from the Ievves, vvho vvere woont to haue feasts together with their sacrifices (specially with their thanks offerings) and at their solemne festivities; or that they had it from some other like originall; it cometh to a like end, as touching the matter spoken off. Deut. 12, 7. and 16, 1 — 15. 1 Sam. 1, 4. with Exod. 32, 6. Psal. 116, 12, 13, 14, with 66, 13, 14, 15. On the other hand may be considered, how it is observed and notedParaeus in 1 Cor. 11.22. Piscator in 1 Cor. 11.34 &c. by divers, that the Apostle tooke them away, and would not suffer the use of them in the church of Corinth, because of abuses that were among them, through faction, schisme, and superfluitie. 1 Cor. 11, 17 — 34. Which being compared vvith the other particulars here before mentioned, may shew that it is a thing indifferent, eyther to keep them, or to leaue them, as they shalbe used or abused, and as everie church shall find to be most expedient for them and their estate: vvhereas if it were a morall & per∣petuall ordinance of God, the abuse onely should be corrected, and the thing it self still continued, and all churches continually bound to the ob∣servation thereof. As we see done in the same place, about the Lords supper it self. 1 Cor. 11.20, 23. &c. CHAPT. XVII. Touching the observation of set Holy dayes, besides the Lords day. And namely, of Easter, and Christmas, &c. VVHether it be lavvful for the church of Christ, now in the time of the Gospell, to consecrate other set dayes, & ordinarily to keep them as holy dayes, besides the Lords day. And, Whether it be lawfull to consecrate some certaine dayes yerely, to the Nativitie, Resurrection, and ascension of Christ; to the Virgin Marie; to the Apostles; and all Saints. Gal. 4, 9, 10, 11. Col. 2, 16, 17. 1 King. 12, 32, 33. Jer. 3, 16, 17. and Exo. 20, 8, 9, 10. with Act. 20, 7. 1 Cor. 16, 1, 2. Rev. 1, 10. 1. Seing that Christ himself by his practise, and the Apostles both by their practise and vvritings, haue commended unto us onely the Lords day, vvhich is the first day of the vveek: wherein Christ our Lord rose a∣gaine from the dead, bringing life and immortalitie to light, and everla∣sting righteousnes into the world, as being by him renewed for ever. In memorial vvhereof we are not enjoyned to set apart yerely other dayes,
besides the Lords day, but (as I noted before upon other occasion) that we should often celebrate the Lords supper, in remembrance of him, so shevving forth his death, untill he come, to make us partakers of eternal salvation in his kingdome for evermore. Iohn 20, 1, 19, 26. Rev. 1, 10. Act. 20, 7. 1 Cor. 16, 1, 2. with 10, 16. and 1, 23 — 26. Dan. 9, 24, 27. Esa. 66, 22, 23. Exo. 20, 8, 9, 10. 2. Now also the observation of dayes & times that was under the Law a shadow of good things to come, is accomplished in Christ. And the ce∣remoniall difference of dayes is taken away together with the rest of the Ievvish shadowes and ceremonies: all times being sanctified in Christ to the name and vvorship of God, so as vve haue not now such need or use of yerely rites and observations, as was heretofore under the Lavv, be∣fore Christs exhibiting in the flesh. Col. 2, 16, 17. Gal. 4, 10, 11. with Esa 66, 23. Jer. 3, 16, 17. 3. And seing vve may not novv thus use the dayes which were once ordeyned by God himself, much lesse may we thus use other that are de∣vised by men, & imposed on the church. Gal. 4, 9, 10, 11. with 1 Kin. 12, 32, 33. 4. Besides that by such observation of dayes, as is aforesaid, supersti∣tion and other corruptions still are nourished, and the Papists and others more confirmed in their errors. 5. Here also may be observed, that festivall or holy dayes are appurte∣nances of the Idols or Images (vvhether Christian or Heathen) to which they vvere first appointed: and thus far forth apperteyne to the second commandement, and are breaches thereof. In which respect likewise, it is not lavvful to invent, or to obserue any such as are devised by men, for the service and worship of God. And therefore, as the reformed chur∣ches haue abolished and taken away the Images of the Saints, Apostles, Virgin Mary, the Rood, Crucifix, and the like: so should they likewise a∣bandon their festivall or holy dayes, with all other remnants of supersti∣tion perteyning thereunto. Exo. 20, 4, 5, 6. with 32, 4, 5. 1 Kin. 12, 33. Esa, 30, 22, 6. And vvhereas some, that haue rejected the other Saints dayes, doe yet reteyne the observation of Christmas, Easter, and the like, in tegard of the Nativitie, and Resurrection of Christ, &c. apply hereunto both the reasons aforesaid, and these also follovving more particularly. Touching Easter, or the Resurrection of Christ. 1. Whereas the observation thereof, from the Apostles times, is much alledged: note, 1. That it comming at the same time vvhen the Passeover was woont to be kept in Israell, it might the more be borne with, as some other rites, dayes, and ceremonies of the Ievves vvere for a time. Act. 15, 19, 20, 21, 24 — 29. Rom. 14, 1, 5. &c. and 15, 1, 2, &c. 2. The great and auncient controversy, that was about the time of the observation thereof, betvveen the East & West Churches, may wel shew that they had no institution or certainty thereof. For if there had ben an Apostolik constitution thereof, vvhat needed there haue ben such a strife
and contention thereabout? 3. We haue vveekely the Lords day, vvherein Christ rose againe from the dead. And vvhat need or use then is there of one day yearely to be kept thereabout: vvhen as weekly we haue the Lords day, on vvhich Christ rose from the dead; and appeared to his disciples that day, and eight dayes after againe (passing over the Ievves Sabbath;) and gaue to Iohn the Revelation on that day, &c. and all his actions are our instructi∣ons. Of vvhich, see more here before, section 1. Concerning vvhich also Iustine Martyr vvriteth thus: On Sunday we haue all generally our meeting toge∣ther: inasmuch as it is the first day, wherein God turning the darknes and matter (which he created at first) made the vvorld: and Jesus Christ our Saviour that self same day rose from the dead. For the day before Saturday he was crucified: and the day after, vvhich is Sunday, appearing to his Apostles and disciples, he taught those things which we relate unto you, that ye might look into them. &c. Iustin. Martyr. Apolog. 2. Ed. Commelin. pag. 77. Touching Christmas, or the Nativity of Christ. 1. That the time thereof is not certainly knowen, or is much mista∣kē: there being many reasons of waight, why it should rather be thought to be in September, then in December, as novv commonly is held and observed. 1. The heauen and earth, and so the vvorld, vvas at first crea∣ted in September (at which moneth, the Ievves to this day begin their ci∣vill yere) vvhereunto fitly is answering the creating of the new heauens and earth, brought in by Christ, and foretold by the Prophets. Esa. 65, 17, 18. and 66.22. Rev 21, 1. 2. The moneth of September vvas in Israell by Gods ordinance, most vvhat a moneth of feasts. Num. 29 cha. with Lev. 23, 23, 24, 27, 34. &c. Which might fitly type out the gladsome birth and comming of Christ at that season into the vvorld; Whereof the Angell said to the Shepheards, Feare not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shalbe to all people. For unto you is borne this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. Luke 2, 10, 11. 3. More particularly, in the moneth of September vvas the Feast of boothes or Tabernacles, solemnely observed in Israell. Levit. 23, 34 — 43. and Numb. 29, 12 — 38. Neh. 7, 73. and 8 chap, Which also might fitly lead unto the birth of Christ at that season: of whom the Gospell saith (speaking of his manifestation in the flesh) The vvord was made flesh, & dwelt as in a booth or Tabernacle among us, &c. Iohn 1, 14. For so doth the vvordIoh. 1, 14 with 7, 2. Mat. 17, 4 Act. 15, 16. Heb. 9. ch. & 11, 9 2 Cor. 5, 1, 4. 2 Pet. 1 13, 14. Rev 21.3. ESCENOSE there used signify, and implyeth thus much. Which may well haue speci∣all reference hereunto. 4. Also in the same moneth vvas the Ark by Salomon brought into the Temple, to the most holy place, at the Feast of Tabernacles. 1 King. 8. 1 — 6. &c. Novv both the Temple, and most holy place, and the Ark it self, vvere speciall types of Christ in divers respects. Iohn. 2, 18 — 21. Hebr. 9, 24. Rom. 3, 25. Rev. 11, 19.
Touching vvhich point, concerning this moneth and matter, because M. BroughtonIn his book cal∣led, Our Lords Fa∣mily, &c. fol. 2. b. & 3. &c. hath observed divers things of good use & moment, I wil here therefore set down his observation in his own words, as followeth: In what moneth S. Mark beginneth his storie: and the rest the opening of the heauens by the second Elias. Because our Lord was baptised, euen beginning thirty, and to open the Kingdome, by teaching the covenant to many, three yeeres and six moneths: Seing his soules passage frō the crosse to the Father is certaine in the fifteenth of Nisan; So his birth and baptisme should be in the seuenth moneth, Aethanim. Which was the first moneth, after the crea∣tion of the world. Of the moneth Ethanim or September. It may somewhat help to marke the old story of Aethanim from 1 King. 8, 2. Al Is∣rael assembled to the King Salomon, in the moneth Aethanim, in the feast, that is the seuenth moneth: And the Sacrificers brought the Ark of the covenant of the Eternall, unto his place; unto the Debir; unto the holy of holyes; and the Cherubims spred their vvings over the place of the Ark. This so solemne should haue antitypon answerable in high matter. And what thing els can be, but that the most Holy was manifest in his Temple; & the army of An∣gels spred their wings; to haue him honoured at his comming then into the World. The explication and story, of the moneth Aethanim The most learned Chaldee Paraphrast Jonathan speaketh thus, of Aethanim. It is the moneth of the auncient, and they called it the first moneth, of festivity. But novv it is the seuenth moneth. Thus David Kimchi doth expound him: Aethanim or Strength is the moneth wherein they gathered the fruits & encrease of the earth, to their houses. For that cause it is called the feast of gathering fruites: So Aethanim meaneth strength: and fruites and en∣crease of the earth be the life of a man. And some of our Doctors ex∣pound Aethanim, the moneth in which the Fathers were borne: the stay (Aethanim) of the world; as the speach, Mich. 6, 2. Heare ye mountaines, and ye strong foundations of the earth. Others call it Aethanim, from the strength of the Lavves that are giuen for this moneth, both feasts, and lawes, So Ralbag saith, I think it called the moneth Aethanim, for the feasts: the strong, and teaching justice: vvhich are in this moneth. Thus far Ralbag. The first day had the Trumpets; the tenth, Expiation; the fifteenth, the feast of Tabernacles, for eight dayes. And Jonathans words cited of me afore, be thus expounded of Cimchi: Before the time, that Israell came from Aegypt, Tisri or Aethanim vvas the first moneth. For in Tisri, the vvorld vvas made. And by reason that the Children of Israell came from Egypt in Nisan, it became the head of moneths, and Tisri became the seuenth. For so the blessed God said unto them: This moneth shalbe unto you the first of moneths. To you, by reason that to the rest of the vvorld it is not first: For Tisri is the first. And thus much for the moneth. So Iohn Baptist well might begin the first day, and assemble unto him much people
fourteen dayes: and our Lord come to him the fifteenth day, when they had learned of the stronger then the Baptist, who would baptize with the holy Ghost and with fyer. So the fower Euangelists celebrating the Baptisme, celebrate the birth, vvhich vvas the same day 29 full yeres. So as the first Adam, and the other to Noah, came into the World that moneth, Christ should come: And that time vvas fittest for Caesar to bid men resort to their cities: And most likely that shepheards vvould yet be abroad vvith their sheep: And fittest for men to goe into a river naked to be baptized. And by Daniels half seuen, Iohn brought in Baptisme; for Heathen; as David and Salomon onely baptised Proselytes. Maimony in Asure Bia, tract. 12, & 13. And if his vvarrant had not ben sure and plaine, from Daniell, none might haue come to him for Baptisme. So our Lord beginning a nevv yere of his age then, shevved the same time of the moneth to haue giuen us his comming into the World. And the Rabbines in Midras Rabba conclude that Messias shalbe borne in Aethanim or Tifri; full of feasts, to teach of him. And God appointed no feasts for the Winter: because of the unseasonablenes of the Weather. Chrysostome mistaking Iohns Fathers storie, thinking that he ministred not in Iune but in September, began to disgrace the state of the Gospell. Hence Turk and Jevv scoff, that vve place the birth, vvhere the conception should be; and can yeeld no reason of our Gospels narrations, vvhich vve make most unlikely to be true. And An∣as Montanus helps Chrysostome, that Zacharie should be high Sacrificer: Whereas all Ievves knovv, that the Candlestick, Table, and Altar of incense vvere vvithout, and daily gone to by the ordinarie sacrificers. Elias, fovver times made the beginning of Da∣niels half seuen, might haue taught the Ievves a sure note, vvhat Elias, Malachie spake off. Novv the end of all the Euangelists is in the first moneth, tovvards leaving the Ae∣gypt of this World at the Pascha. And at Pentecost after, the Lavv vvas giuen to Mo∣ses, vvhen the fiery lavv of the spirit vvas by Jesus giuen. So the conception of John, vvhere men placed his birth, falleth to Midsommer; and birth to the spring Aequinoctiall: and likewise the conception of Mary fell most fitly to Mid-winter; and our Lords comming into the world, to theSeptem∣ber. first moneth after the crea∣tion; and his Redemption, to theMarch. first moneth for redemption from Aegypt. These mat∣ters agree with Scripture, and plaine reason, &c. Thus far M. Broughton; whose observations about this matter, I thought here to insert, because they are of great waight, and giue great light to the point in hand. 5. Hither also may be referred, that Christ, after he was baptized, was fower Passeovers at Ierusalem: and thatLuke 3, 21, 23. being baptized at that sea∣son of the yere when he was borne: the things vvhich he did betvveene his baptisme and the first Passeover, vvere so many and of such sort, as might well take up all the time betvveene September and the Passeover in March follovving: As namely, his being in the wildernes where he was tempted, fourty dayes. Mark 1, 9 — 13. His abiding some while about the place vvhere Iohn baptised, Ioh. 1, 28, 29, 35, 43. His departing into Ga∣lilee: and going both to Cana of Galilee, where he was at a mariage, Joh. 2, 1 — 11. and to Nazareth, vvhere (as his custome vvas) he vvent into the Synagogue, and preached on the Sabbath day. Luke 4, 16. and from thence to Capernaum, vvhere he dvvelt, and taught likewise on the Sab∣bath dayes. Mat. 4, 12, 13. Mar. 1, 14, 21. Luke 4, 31. Joh. 2, 12. His journey
also from thence to Ierusalem, to the Passeover (the first Passeover, after he vvas baptized) vvhich is spoken off, Iohn 2, 13. besides that he did ma∣ny things, which are not all particularly recorded. Ioh. 21, 25. Thus then might vvel so much time be spent, as was between September & March, vvherein the first Passeover following his Baptisme vvas celebrated. 6. Especially, here is to be observed, the half seuen, of three yeres and an half (spoken off by Daniell) wherein Christ preached, after he was baptized. Whereunto fitly ansvvereth the space of time between Septem∣ber and March, conteyning half a yere or six moneths: whereas if the reckoning be made from the end of December (where the nativity of Christ is now commonly placed) unto the Passeover in March following, there vvilbe but onely three moneths, and not six moneths or the half yere, before spoken off. Dan. 9.27. Whereunto also (as touching the time) that phrase of speach may haue reference, vvhich is used concerning the vvoman in the Revelation, of a time, and times, and half a time. Rev. 12.14. 7. Finally, as the Lords supper now among Christians, answereth to all the Sacrifices which they had in Israell heretofore: so also the Lords day now is to us in stead of all their Feasts and holy dayes of Sabbaths, Nevv moones, Passeover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. So as novv vve haue no cause or need of such yerely dayes and Feasts, as then they had; Christ being come, who is the body of all those shadowes, vvhereof the Feasts vvere a part. Col. 2, 16, 17. compared vvith Esa. 66, 23. Act. 20, 7. Rev. 1, 10, 11, &c. Of vvhich, see more here before, Chap. 14. sect. 2, and 5, &c. On the other hand, there is alledged the ordinance concerning the Feast ofOr, Lots. Purim, enacted by Mardochee and Ester, & accepted by the Iewes for them and their generations after them, in memorie of their deliverance from the tretcherie of Haman, &c. Ester 9, 20— 32. Touching vvhich, these things may be observed: 1. that the book of Ester (wherein this is re∣corded) is Canonicall Scripture: and vvhether it were written by Ezra, or by Mardochee himself, or by some Prophet that lived in those times; as the book it self, so also the Feast there spoken off, hath the approba∣tion of the Spirit of God, by vvhich that historie was written. And who can say othervvise, but that the Feast aforesaid vvas in deed ordeyned & agreed upon by speciall instinct and direction of the spirit of God? 2. That Feast might also be a civill ordinance and solemnity, kept in memoriall of the deliverance aforesaid. And so much might both the maner of enacting it, and the name and use of it likewise import; it be∣ing established accounted & observed, as a time of feasting and joy, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poore. Esther 9, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 — 29 — 32. 3. And hovv ever it were observed, whether as an ordinance civill, or ecclesiasticall, or both: yet this is evident, that this vvas done in the time before Christ, when as now they had the observances of the lavv, where∣of their Feasts vvere a part by the ordinance of God: from the bondage vvhereof vve are now freed by Christ, and are taught by the Apostle to
stand fast in the liberty vvherevvith Christ hath made us free, and not to be intangled againe vvith the yoke of bondage. Concerning which, the Apostle reproving the Christians saith, Ye obserue dayes, and moneths, & times, and yeares: I am afrayd of you, least I haue bestowed upon you labour in vayne. Gal. 4, 10, 11. and 5, 1. &c. Which last reason may be observed in like sort, about the Feast of the De∣dication, spoken off, Iohn 10, 22, 23. (at vvhich time Iohn saith, Christ walked in the Temple, in Salomons porch, and reasoned vvith the Iewes) which vvas a Feast ordeyned by Iudas Machabeus and the Congregation of Israel, in remembrance of the dedication of the Altar, spoken off, 1 Mach. 4, 59. Whereunto likevvise may be applied the former reason, touching the Feasts and shadovves then used, vvhich typed out our spiritual joy in Christ, vvho is the trueth and body of all those shadowes and observati∣ons. Col. 2, 16, 17. And vvhereas some, for defence of Holy dayes invented by men al∣ledge the voluntarie sacrifices had in Israell: let these things further be obser∣ved thereabout: 1. That those sacrifices in Israell vvere to be such one∣ly as God had prescribed, & so to be observed, as the Lord had appoin∣ted. 2. That no Prince or persons might forbid or take them away with∣out sinne. Which I suppose vvill not be said touching the aforesaid ob∣servation of Holy dayes. 3. That they vvere not urged upon Churches or persons against their will, as the Holy dayes prescribed by men now be. 4. That this or that man might bring them upon speciall occasion, vvhen the vvhole Church was not bound thereunto: vvhereas the obser∣vation aforesaid is laid as a duty upon vvhole Churches, and not left vo∣luntarie to this or that man, to doe or leaue undone, as they see cause. 5. That many vvho obserue and plead for them, doe sometimes acknow∣ledge them to be humane ordinances, vvishing they were taken avvay, and keep them against their will. And hovv then can they be accounted as the voluntarie sacrifices vvhich the Lord prescribed, and Israell obser∣ved of old? 6. Finally, if this plea vvere good and sufficient in such ca∣ses, vvhat inventions of men are there in religion, that some would not thus plead for, that they are as the voluntarie sacrifices had in Israell: & so open a vvide doore to all vvill worship, and in deed take avvay the se∣cond commandement, or securely transgresse it under such colours and pretences? CHAPTER XVIII. Of dealing with sinners, for their reclayming, or censuring. Where also is treated of Suspension, and excommunication, &c. VVHether the ordinance of God, for the reclayming and gayning of brethren that fall into sinne, should not stil be observed care∣fully & religiously, among the members of the church. And that as there
is occasion, they be brought to the assembly of the Governours, or the Congregation, in publike (having all things caried in order, and accor∣ding to the rules of governement, prescribed by the Lord:) that so the cause being heard, a due examination of the parties and vvitnesses being made, and the fault certainly found out and convinced, the parties offen∣ding may (according to the nature of the sinne) be admonished; secluded, suspended, or debarred for a time from the Lords supper, & other mee∣tings of the church, or use of the holy things of God therein; yea euen cut off from the church, and delivered to Sathan, if the case so require. Such of the brethren (I say) as doe sinne and offend, whether it be that they reproach abuse or injurie others by word or deed, and despise the private admonitions of their brethren and of the vvitnesses, that deale with them; or that they offend publikely; or doe otherwise transgresse in their conversation; or that in religion they fall into heresy, idolatry, or other impietie and iniquitie; and so persist, after all good meanes religi∣ously used for their reclayming. This being still carefully regarded, as is aforesaid, that the order appointed by God in his word, be observed; that the Elders and Governours performe all such things, as perteyne to their office & duetie of their calling; & that the other members of the church doe keepe themselues every one in their place, vvith all modestie, reve∣rence, peace, and godlynes, beseeming the church and people of God. Lev. 19, 17. Prov. 25, 8, 9, 10. Luke 17, 3, 4. and Matth. 18.15.16.17.18. compared with Mat. 5.22. 1 Sam. 2.25. 1 Cor. 6.1 — 5. Deut. 1.16.17. Exod. 18, 13 — 20. and 20.12. Psal. 82.1. Dan. 4.17.24.

Num. 12.14. and 15.32 — 36. & 19.11.12.13. &c. and 35.12.24.25. with Deut. 19.12.15.16.17.18. and 21.18 — 21. and 22.15 — 21. and 24.8.9. and 25.1 — 10. with Ruth. 4, 1 — 11. 2 Chro. 19, 5 — 11. and 23.19. vvith 1 Thes. 5.12.13.14.

Because this is a morall and perpetual ordinance & direction, giuen by the Lord, in his vvord, both to the church of Israell heretofore, and to the Christian churches and people of God for ever. As may be seene in the Scriptures here noted before. Neyther doeth it hinder, that in Israell, there vvere some judiciall and ceremoniall things, which vvere temporarie, in some cases also mixed and prescribed vvithall. For the same also may be said and observed, about other the precepts of the Law & of the Ten Commandements: vvhich all acknowledge to be morall and perpetual. Besides that the spirituall application, and perpetuall equity of the cere∣monies and ordinances that are abolished, doth still remaine and conti∣nevv, for the instruction, use, comfort, and direction of the church, for ever. And this in matters of all sorts, whether perteyning to the faith, vvorship, ministerie, order or government of the church, &c. As may be
seen in these and the like Scriptures: Gen. 17, 11, 12, 13. compared vvith Col. 2.11.12. and Rom. 4, 11. Exo. 12.3 — 17. with Luke 22, 1 — 20. and with 1 Cor. 5, 2 — 6.7 8.11. and 10.16.17.18. and 11.23 — 26. & Mat. 16, 6 — 12. and Luk. 12.1. Exod. 28. and 29. and 30 ch. with Psal. 132.9.16. and 141, 2.

And that this order vvas observed in Israell and in the primitiue churches, in cases of sinne, controversie, complaint, censure & excommu∣nication, (besides the extraordinarie occasions that fell out or vvere cari∣ed after any extraordinarie manner:) may appeare by the Scriptures be∣fore mentioned: vvith vvhich, these also here follovving may be compa∣red.

Iude ver. 17 — 23. Rev. 2. and 3 chap. Where, both for private dealing and publike proceeding vvith sinners, see the Scriptures here cited before, and the like. And more particularly, for secluding, suspending and debarring from the Lords Table, or other holy things & meetings also of the church,Of suspen∣sion. see both the Scriptures afore∣said that concerne this matter, namely, Gen. 3, 22, 23, 24.

Iude ver. 22, 23. & these reasons following. 1. The Lords debarring and keeping our first parents by theAngels. Cheru∣bims from the sacrament of life eternall, that is, from the tree of life in the garden of God. Thereby teaching the Governours of his church, to debarre and seclude such from the Sacraments, to whom in their estate they doe not apperteyne. Gen. 3, 22, 23, 24. compared vvith the Scriptures before cited, and vvith Sal. Song. 4, 12 — 16. and 5, 1. &c. 2. So likewise Porters vvere set by the high Priest, at the gates of the Lords house, that none who vvere uncleane in any thing, should enter in.Lev. 15 ch. 2 Chro. 23, 19. compared vvith Num. 19, 11, 12, 13. &c. and 9, 5, 10, 11. vvith 1 Cor. 10, 16, 17, 18. & 2 Thes 3, 14, 15. Whereby also may appeare, that the duetie, vvhich men should be carefull off themselues, if they neglect it the Governors should look unto it, and see it be done. For which note moreover, 2 Chro. 26, 16 — 21. Mat. 5, 23 — 26. Act. 20, 28. Heb. 13, 17. Rev. 2,
14, 15, 20. &c. 3. Gods ordinance touching Leprosie, that the Priest in case of doubt, should shut up the party for a time, and not yet put them out of the host: And then after a certaine time, as they should be found, eyther put them out of the host, or pronounce them to be cleane. The aequity vvhereof still remayneth. Lev. 13, & 14 ch. vvith 2 Cor. 6, 14 — 17. Jude, ver. 22, 23. Num. 5, 1 — 4. with Deu. 24, 8, 9. Whereabout withal note the Lords owne dealing vvith Miriam: set before us for instructton and example. Num. 12, 14. com∣pared with Deu. 24, 8, 9. and Rom. 15, 4. 2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. 4. Suspension also may be considered to be like that keeping of per∣sons in ward, whereof we read Lev. 24.12. Num. 15, 24. til it manifestly ap∣peare that the parties suspended are to be cutte off and cast out of the Congregation: Like as those words, Take avvay the evill from among you, being spoken by Moyses of putting to death in Israell, Deu. 17, 7, 12. & 19.19. and 21, 21. & 22, 21, 22, 24. are by the Apostle applied to the putting out of the church by excommunication. 1 Cor. 5, 13. where Paul useth the very same vvords, that are in the Septuagint, Deu. 17, 7. &c. 5. Thus as sinnes and sinners differ among themselues,Jude, ver. 22, 23. so shal also the censures & punishments thereof be different one from another. A thing that was observed in the church and common wealth of Israell: and is euen by the light of reason regarded in all kingdomes and good govern∣ments: and may be seen at this day in kings Courts and houses every vvhere. How much more should regard hereof be had in the church & house of the great king of Kings: vvho hath giuen most just and equall lavves to his church and people: & where all things should most orderly and carefully be observed? To giue particular instance in kings houses; vvhere when men offend, it is knowen that some are secluded from the Table, Presence chamber; or Porches entry; some are bound or deteined in the Porters lodge, or other prison house; and some are altogether cast out and put from the court. So hath the Lord and great king divers cen∣sures and punishments in his church, debarring some from his table, as∣semblies, or entrance thereof; restreyning others in darknes, & bynding them up as with bands of excommunication, till by such meanes they learne to repent and amend; and appointing others (according to their estate and desert) to utter darknes for ever. Of which more hereafter. 6. Thus also shal we not need, for some, to withhold the ministration of the holy things of God from all the rest of the church, neyther to in∣terrupt the publike worship, or trouble the whole church by present dea∣ling with such persons, nor be driuen to take any disorderly courses at al but using this meanes of debarring and suspension of some (vvhere there is cause) for a time, vve may with the rest stil continevv on our service & worship of God in peace and holynes. 7. And for such persons themselues, thus there may also be triall whe∣ther by this meanes they can be brought to repentance and amende∣ment, and so be kept from the greater & heavier censure of excommu∣nication.
Othervvise they may aftervvard be further proceeded withall, if that yet they repent not, but doe still continevv in their sinnes, or in∣crease therein, adding stubbernes more and more thereunto. Iustif. of Separ. pag. 185, 186. &c.By all vvhich may appeare, hovv greatly they erre, vvho hold Suspen∣sion to be a corruption and devise of men, and doe neither practise nor allow thereof. Whose error will yet more appear by that vvhich follovveth to be spoken touching Excommunication. Where first see the Scriptures be∣fore alledged, which concerne this point: Namely, Gen. 4, 14, 16. and 21, 9,Of Excom∣munication 10, 12. Lev. 13 ch. Num. 9, 13. Deut. 17, 7. and 19, 19. with 1 Cor. 5, 13. 2 Chron. 26, 21. Ezra 10, 8. Esa. 66, 5. John 9, 22. and 12, 42. and 16, 2. 1 Cor 5, 3, 4, 5, 11. and 16, 22. Gal. 1, 8, 9. and 5, 12. 1 Tim. 1, 20. Jude ver. 14, 22, 23. Revel. 2, 14, 15, 20, &c. and these reasons withall. 1. The knovven and auncient censures had among the Iewes, and differing one from another, to wit, Niddui, Cherem, and Schammatha or Ana∣thema Maranatha. Niddui, that is, separation, seclusion, suspension, or the lesse excommunication: Cherem, that; is cutting off, or the greater excom∣munication: Schammatha, or Anathema Maranatha, vvhich is an utter devo∣ting to destruction and to the judgment of the Lord at his comming. An∣svverable whereunto among Christians also are, Suspension, Excommunication, and the great Anathema: Or (so to call them) the lesse Excommunication, the greater Excommunication, and the greatest of all. Whereunto the Scriptures aforesaid may be referred and applied. So as therefore they erre greatly and are mistaken, vvho hold, that if there were amongst the Jewes in Christs time any distinct ordinance of excommunication ecclesiasticall,Iust. of Sep. pag. 187. &c. it was a Iewish devise, & without ground of the Scriptures. 2. To vvhich end may also be observed, the Lords divers dealing with Adam, and vvith Cain. Adam he debarred of accesse to the tree of life and use thereof, driving and keeping him out of the garden by the Che∣rubims, as is aforesaid. But Cain he accursed, and cast him out from his presence, and made him a fugitiue & a vagabond in the earth. Gen. 3, 22, 23, 34. with 4, 11 — 16. The one fitly noting out Suspension, and the other Excommunication. 3. Likevvise the Lords ordinance of putting the Leapers & uncleane out of the host: the trueth & equitie vvhereof, as of the other shadowes of the Law, still abideth. Lev. 13 chap. Numb. 5, 1 — 4. with Deu. 24, 8, 9. 2 Chro. 26, 16 — 21. 2 Cor. 6, 14 — 17. Iude, ver. 22, 23. 4. The practise of Noah, cursing Cham: Gen. 9, 24, 25. of Abraham, ca∣sting Hagar and Ismael out of his house, Gen. 21, 10, 12. of the Priests thru∣sting Vzziah out of the Temple, and cutting him off from the house of the Lord. 2 Chron. 26, 16 — 21. of the Princes and Elders, devoting the sub∣stance of the disobedient, and separating them from the congregation of Israell that vvas caried away captiue. Ezra 10, 8. Which, vvhether it be ap∣plied to Suspension or Excommunication, and understood of civill or ec∣clesiasticall proceeding, or both, it giueth good proof and evidence for the point in hand.
5. Yea the very abuse of the censures, vvhich vvas sometimes among the Ievves, doth plainly shevv how they vvere the ordinances of God, though perverted & abused among them, as vvere sometimes also other of the Lavves of God. Esa. 66, 5. Luke 6, 22. Iohn. 9, 22. and 12, 42. and 16, 2. 6. The Apostles doctrine and practise concerning excommunication of the wicked, and delivering of them unto Sathan. 1 Cor. 5 ch. 1 Tim. 1.20. Where moreover is to be noted, thatTake a∣way the wicked frō amōg you. the words vvhich are spoken by Moses of putting to death in Israel, are by Paul applied to excommunica∣tion and putting out of the church: as I noted here before, out of 1 Cor. 5, 13. compared with Deu. 17, 7. &c. So as this also may both shew us a ground for excommunication out of Moses, and direct us hovv to vvalk aright in using of it, for the proceeding thereabout: vvhen as all persons, both the Elders and people, be carefull to doe their duetie, and keep their places answerably to the Elders and people of Israell: that so (notwithstanding any differences of estate incident to them and us) yet still a perpetuall e∣quitie and due proportion between us and Israell may be observed. Of which see more in the Treatise, vvhich I vvrote some vvhile since concer∣ning the exposition of Mat. 18.17. pag. 18. &c. And note vvithall, hovv the words aforesaid (Take away the evill from among you:) are generall and such as may vvell comprehend the taking avvay of the vvicked from among the people of God, whether by death, or by excommunication, and the like: as Israel according to the diversitie of their estate and occasions u∣sed sundry waies, sometimes the one, sometime the other, &c. 7. Whereabout further may be considered the terme of judging, often used by Moses and the other Prophets and Apostles: And how in judi∣ciarie proceeding, the Scripture useth this word, and attributeth it some∣times to the Lord himself, or to his Ministers and Officers in church or common vvealth, for hearing, examining, deciding, giving sentence, & executing judgment, concerning persons and causes, civill or ecclesiasti∣call: Gen. 18, 25. Exo. 18, 13, 16, 21, 22. Deu. 1.16, 17. and 16, 18. and 17, 9. & 19, 12, 17, 18. with Num. 35, 12 — 24. Deu. 25, 1, 2. 2 Sam. 8, 15. 2 Chron. 19, 5, 6. Psa. 82, 1, 2, 8. and 122, 5. Esa. 1, 23, 26. Ier. 21, 11, 12. and 22, 1, 2, 3. Eze. 44, 15, 23, 24. Micah 3, 1, 11. and 4, 3. Act. 16, 4. and 18, 15. 1 Cor. 5, 12, 13. and 6, 1. &c. and sometimes to the people, for consenting, approving, executing, & resting in that vvhich is judged & done according to the sentence giuen by the Lord, or the Ministers and Governours under him. 1 Cor. 6, 2, 3. with 5, 12, 13. Act. 26, 10. with 22, 20. and Act. 21, 25. with 15, 6, 22. and with 16, 4. &c. 8. Lastly, Christs reproving of the Angels & Ministers of his churches, for suffering evill persons and corruptions among them. Revel. 2, 14, 15, 20. &c. Which necessarily implyeth, that the Lord hath giuen an ordi∣nance to his church, for the restreyning, repressing and abandoning of such. Els why should they be blamed for that which perteyned not unto them, or vvere not in their povver to redresse and amend? The like also may be observed by Christs speach & commission giuen to his Apostles, and by their execution thereof. Mat. 16, 19. Joh. 20, 22, 23 with 1 Cor. 4, 1, 2,
21. and 5, 3, 4, 5. and 2 Cor. 10, 4, 5, 6, 8. and 13, 2, 3, 10. 1 Tim. 1, 20. And by the exhortations and instructions, that are giuen to Timothee and Titus, in Pauls Epistles unto them: and to the Elders of Israell, and the Primitiue churches, recorded in the Scriptures both of the old & new Testament. 3. And for the maner of proceeding, if the course aforesaid be right∣ly observed, thus shall matters and persons be orderly and peaceably heard, discussed, and judged: the governours and government accord∣ing to the ordinance of God regarded; and al good meanes used for the churches good and peaceable estate; for the preventing and suppressing of manifold evils; and for the benefit and reclayming of sinners: & such as are found to be obstinate in iniquity, shal by publik authority be cen∣sured and excommunicated: and that also with knowledge and assent of the church, the exceptions of al, if any be brought, being heard, as is meet and in such cases to be done. And so shall the church be purged from e∣vill; the holy things of God kept from the pollution and profanation of such wicked persons; the sinners themselues made more ashamed, being made knowen unto all, and avoyded by them till they repent; and the rest that remayne, shall all heare, and learne, and feare, and commit no more any such evill among them. For vvhich also see the Scriptures before alledged: and Deu. 4, 1, 2. and 13 chap. and 16, 18. and 19, 19, 20. 2 Thes. 3, 6, 14, 15. 1 Tim. 5, 17, 19, 20. and 6.13, 14. 2 Tim. 3, 1 — 5. Rev. 2, 14, 20. &c. 4. Furthermore, as in all other affaires of the church, so in these also (according to the severall nature of them) may the benefit of Gods or∣dinance thus be enjoyed; and all things done in order; so as none be prejudiced, but that every one may performe their duety, & enjoy their right and liberty: and that both the corruptions of the Popish prelacy, and the defects of the Protestant reformed churches, and al popular con∣fusion, disorder, and anarchie may be shunned, redressed, & taken away. Col. 2, 5. 1 Cor. 4, 17. and 11, 2, 16. and 14, 33, 40. compared vvith 1 Chron. 13 ch. and 15, 2, 13. and the other Scriptures here cited before. And because in this matter there hath ben, and still is, great question and controversie among Christians, both Papists, Anabaptists, and Prote∣stants of all sorts, about the understanding of the words of Christ, Tell  unto the church, and if he neglect to heare the church, let him be unto thee as an hea∣then man, and a Publicane, Mat. 18, 17. it shall not be amisse here also to in∣quire further into the meaning hereof. Which therefore I wil novv speak off more particularly in the chapter following. CHAPT. XIX. Of the exposition of those words of Christ, Tell the Church, &c. Mat. 18.17. VVHether those words of Christ, Tell it to the Church, &c. Matt. 18, 17. may not be applied to the estate of the Ievves, as it was when
Christ thus spake, and to the estate of Christians succeeding aftervvard:I. Of the Synedrion, or Congre∣gation of Elders. And first applying it to the estate of the Iewes, whether they may not then be understood of the Synedrion or Congregation of Elders had in Israel: for these reasons follovving. 1. The like use of the word, in other places of the Scripture, where the speach is of matters concerning government, controversie, complaint or pleading about sinne, or the like, as there is here in this place. For vvhich, see Psal. 82, 1. Num. 25, 12, 24, 25, 29. with Deut. 19, 11, 12, 16, 17. Iosh. 20, 4, 5, 6. Mat. 18, 17. with 5, 22. and vvith 1 Sam. 2, 25. Num. 27, 1, 2. vvith 36, 1. and Josh. 17, 3, 4, &c. Neyther is it of any waight herein that some exce∣pting say, the Elders of Israell were civill governours, and dealt in civill causes, &c. For Israell was the Church of God, asvvell as vve, Act. 7, 38. with Deu. 33, 4. and their Elders dealt in causes of sinne, and in the matters of the Lord, as vvell as ours. 1 Sam. 2, 25. 2 Chron. 19, 8 — 11. and the question is, whether the phrase may be understood of an assembly of El∣ders, whether civill or ecclesiasticall, vvhether in Israell or with us, Mat. 18, 17. vvith 5, 22. and Deut. 19, 16, 17. and 21, 20. Psal. 82, 1. Ier. 19, 1. and Christ and the Apostles reason often, from the estate of the Governours and people of Israell, to ours novv, applying the things that are spoken there∣of, to the kingdome and church of Christ under the Gospell. Iohn 10, 34.35, 36. compared vvith Psal. 82, 6. Mat. 21, 42. vvith Psal. 118.22. Act. 1, 20. with Psal. 69, 26. and 109, 7. 1 Cor. 5, 6, 13. vvith Exod. 12, 15. and Deu. 17, 7. & 19, 19. 1 Cor. 9, 13, 14. with Deu. 18, 1. &c. 1 Cor. 10, 1 — 18. Rom. 15, 4. 2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. 2 Pet. 1, 19, 20. &c. Not to speak of that, which the Apostle expresse∣ly writeth to the church of Corinth, touching the judgments of things pertey∣ning to this life. 1 Cor. 6, 4, 5. 2. The vvord is not Kabal (asM. Iac. Divine In∣stitution of a ministeri∣all church. Argum. 3, Signature Bs, &c. some haue thought) but Ghnedah or Ghnidtah in the Syriack (the tongue then used by the Iewes & Christ him∣self) Which all graunt, is often put for the Congregation of governours, meeting at a knovvne time and place, &c. Psal. 82, 1. Num. 25, 12. and 27, 2. with 36, 1. Iosh. 20, 4, 5, 6. Exod. 12, 3, 21. Lev. 8, 3, 5. with 9, 1, 3. See also M. Ainsvv. Counterpoyson, pag. 113. And note, hovv R. Salomon understan∣deth those words in Lev. 4, 13. (If the wholeGhnedah Congregation of Israell sinne through ignorance, &c.) of the Iudges of the Sanhedrin, vvhich represented the whole Congregation: AsDrusij Com. in lo∣cu difficil. Pentatch. p. 244. Drusius noteth upon that place. Besides that if the vvord vvere Kahal, yetAs M. Ains. him∣self also ac∣knovvledg¦eth. Count. p. 113. that word also sometimes is used for the assemblie of Elders and Governours, the Synedrion, &c. 1 Chron. 13, 1, 2. and 29, 1, 6. compared vvith 28, 1, 2. and 2 Chron. 1, 2, 3. Deu. 23, 1, 2. and 31, 28, 30. and so is translated by the word Synedrion, in the Septuagint. Pro. 26, 26. For which moreover see Psal. 26, 4, 5. where for those vvords, I haue not sit vvith vaine persons, I haue hated the congregation of evill doers, &c. the Septuagint hath, I haue not sit vvith the Synedrion or councill of vanity, I haue hated the Congregation of the malignant, &c. or, the church of evill doers, as M. Ains. translateth it: how ever he passe over that point touching the Synedrion, in his notes upon that place. Which may the more be observed, because the Psalme there useth
the termes of sitting, and of taking bribes, and the like, which the Scripture also otherwhere often ascribeth to Rulers and Governours. And now that I am speaking of this matter, it is also worth the noting, how M. Ains. himself (a notable adversarie of this exposition) cannot de∣ny, but thatM. Ain. Animadv. pag. 13. in the old Testament he hath observed the word Church, to meane the congregation of Elders. Yet to obscure the trueth, and blynd his follovvers vvith vanity and errour (vvhat he can herein) he addeth this glose vvith∣all concerning it, that now the old Testament is chaunged. And vvhat if ano∣ther now should arise, and say in like sort, that in the old Testament he hath observed the vvord Church to meane the Congregation of the people: but that novv the old Testament is chaunged: vvould not himself readily discerne and con∣demne the vanity and errour of such ansvvers and assertions? Wherabout note, that the speach is not of the legal covenant of works, or the Curse thereof, neyther of the ceremonies or any changeable or∣dinances of the Law (as sometimes by the old Testament is understood) but of the Scriptures and books of the old Testament, and of the vvords and phrases used therein. Touching vvhich, he saith the old Testament novv is chaunged. Which if it were true, as he saith, then should we be freed from the use of those vvords and Scriptures, and whosoever obserue them, should make Christ unprofitable unto them. For so are we freed and set at libertie from the yoke of the Law & old Testament that novv is chan∣ged. Gal. 5, 1, 2. Col. 2, 8, 16, 17, 20. Heb. 8, 7, 13. Thus also he is fallen into the same errour, vvhich heretoforeM. Ains. Defence of Script. pag. 28, 32. &c he convinced as detestable and bla∣sphemous in M. Smith: vvho likevvise perverting some words and phra∣ses of Scripture (as namely, that of blotting out and taking avvay the hand writing that was against us, &c.) gathered thereupon, that the written Lavv of Moses & the Prophets was novv blotted out and taken away from the church. And thus more∣over he maketh his own Annotations vvhich he publisheth on Genesis, Exo∣dus, the Psalmes, &c. yea all the arguments and proofs that in his doctrine or other vvritings he bringeth out of the books of the old Testament, to be vayn and unsound? So as any that read or heare them, might turne them away with his owne glose, and tell him that the old Testament novv is chaunged. Yea thus he annihilateth the proofs and testimonies, that in the Nevv Testament are alledged by the Apostles out of the old: And taketh avvay the meanes of persvvading the Iewes to the Christian faith: with vvhom we must eyther reason from the Scriptures of the old Testament, as beingPsal. 19, 7 8, 9. Prov. 22, 21. Mat. 5, 18. the Word of God that endureth for ever, and that hath the cer∣taintie of the vvords of truths or els vvhat hope can we haue ever to per∣swade them to the faith of Christ? But the Apostles teach us farre otherwise then this Opposite that2 Pet. 1, 19. the Propheticall vvord is a most sure vvord, to which vve shall doe vvel to take heed: And, that2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. all the Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to im∣proue, to correct, to instruct in righteousnes: that the man of God may be absolute, and made perfect to all good works. To let this Opposite therefore alone with his shifts and errors: I vvill proceed vvith the matter in hand.
3. Where obserue next, the agreement of Christs speach in Mat. 18, 17. with that other speach of Christ, in Mat. 5, 22. Where, Christ in the one place teacheth the offending party how to carry himself, Mat. 5.22.23. &c. and in the other the party offended, Mat. 18, 15. &c. and in both places, shevveth to whom the brother offending may be brought, saying in the one place, Tell it to the church or Congregation, Mat. 18.17. & in the other, he is in daunger of the councill or Synedrion, Mat. 5, 22. Besides the agreement that these Scriptures also haue, with those other in 1 Sam. 2, 25. Deu. 1, 16. and 19. 16.17. and 21, 19. 2 Chron. 19.6, 10. 1 Thes. 5, 12, 13. 1 Tim. 5, 17. Hebr. 13, 17. and the like. And note here, how M. Brightman treating of this matter in his exposition of Salomons Song, and applying it to the time of the Go∣spell, saith expressely, that he thinketh, there is one and the same intendement of Christs speach in Mat. 5, 22. as is of that in Mat. 18, 15. &c. Of which judgment are others also, vvhom I need not mention in particular. 4. Moreover the Syriack translation, in Mat. 5, 22. hath Kenushta, which signifieth a congregation, assemblie, or synagogue, where the Greeke Originall hath Synedrion, the Councill or Congregation of the Elders. And the like againe, in Mat. 26, 59. Which plainly sheweth, hovv they sometimes use the vvord congregation or assemblie, where the Greek hath Synedrion, the sitting or assemblie of the Elders: And is the more to be marked, because the same translation othervvhere useth the same word KENUSHTA so generally, as it putteth it for the Greek vvord SYNAGOGE, the Synagogue. Mat. 4, 23. & 9, 35. & 10, 17. where also it hath BETH DINE, the house of judgment, for the Greek SY∣NEDRION, the councill or sitting of the Elders: so both using divers vvords, and the same vvords diversly, about these matters. Which may wel be obser∣ved likewise, for the better understanding of Christs speach in Mat. 18, 17. 5. As also, that by the ordinance of God, the deciding of causes, and judging of persons, is to be by the Rulers and Iudges deputed by God, & according to his word: and not according to the voyces of the people, or multitude of them, &c. Deu. 1, 16, 17. and 16, 18. vvith 1 Cor. 6, 4, 5. and Deu. 17, 8, 11. and 19, 17. Exod. 18, 15, 16.21.22. and 20, 12. and 23.2. 1 Sam. 2.25. 2 Chron. 19, 5 — 11. Mat. 5, 22. 1 Tim. 5, 17. Heb. 13, 17. 6. And that the Elders and Governours are dayly to attend hereunto, as there is occasion; and for this cause (among other) are to haue main∣tenance & double honour of the Congregation: vvhereas the other men haue their other imployment at home and abroad, & the women are to keep at home and looke to their household affaires, &c. Exod. 18, 13, 21, 22. Deu. 1, 16, 17. and 25, 4. Prov. 31.23.27. Acts 20, 17, 28. Rom. 12, 8. 1 Thes. 5, 12, 13. 2 Thes. 3, 10, 12. 1 Tim. 5, 17, 18, 19. Tit. 2, 4, 5, 15. and 3, 10. 1 Pet. 5, 1 — 4. 7. Also, that the Elders sitting publikely at a knovven time and place, may heare and judge the causes of their brethren, if the parties and wit∣nesses be present: though no other of the people be then and there with them. Deu. 1.16.17. and 19, 16.17. 1 Sam. 2, 25. 2 Chron. 19, 5 — 11. Mat. 5, 22. 1 Tim. 5, 17.19.20.21. Hebr. 13.17. Where againe may be considered that which I noted before, hovv the Syriack hath BETH DINE, the house of judg∣ment,
where the Greek hath SyNEDRION, the Councill or sitting of the Elders, Mat. 10, 17. And moreover that we read the people were hearing of do∣ctrine in the Temple, whiles the Synedrion & Governours vvere other∣where assembled together. Act. 5, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27. &c. 8. Besides that as of old, so still the Eldership consisteth not onely of Ministers; but also of the Elders of the people; such as are chosen out of the people, by the people, and for the people, in this behalf. And that there∣fore this doeth no more take avvay any right or povver of the people now, then it did of old, but doeth rather in deed establish and confirme it still, and shevv us how to use it aright, as in Israel heretofore: notwith∣standing any differences between our estate and theirs in other respects. Jer. 19, 1. 2 Chron. 19, 8. Ezech. 44, 15, 24. Deu. 1, 13, 15. and 16, 18. and 19, 17. with 1 Tim. 5, 17. Rom. 12, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. 1 Thes. 5, 12. &c. 9. Neyther may we bring or admitte of any other understanding of this Scripture, Mat. 18, 17. then such as agreeth with Moses and the Pro∣phets. Esa. 8, 20. Mat. 7, 22. Luke 16, 29, 31. Act. 26, 22. Hos. 8, 12. Mal. 4, 4. 2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. For Christ came not to destroy the Lavv and the Prophets, but to fulfill them. And the Pharisees would haue ben glad, if they could haue had any such exception against Christ or his doctrine any way. Mat. 5, 17, 18, 19, 20. &c.. 10. Finally, both the things here going before (about private dealing with a brother that sinneth against us, & the taking of one or tvvo more with us, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. Mat. 18, 15, 16.) and the things also following after in this verse, where it is said, Let him be to thee as an Heathen and Publicane, Mat. 18, 17. are spoken according to the Iewes phrase & understanding. And why not then also that which is in the midst betvveen both: Considering withall that the speach vvas unto Ievves, and spoken by Christ that lived among them, and usually applied his doctrine and maner of speaking to their estate. II. Of the Christian Presbyterie or assembly of Elders.Next, applying it to the estate of the Christian church, whether then it may not also consequently be understood of the Christian Presbyterie & congregation of Elders, or fitly applied thereunto: for these reasons fol∣lovving, together with the former. 1. ThatLuk. 2, 32, 33. with 2 Sam. 7, 16. Esa. 16, 5. Ier. 23, 5. and 33, 15, 16, 25, 26. vvith 1 Cor. 12, 12, 27, 28. Dan. 7, 14, 27. Mica. 4, 2, 8. and 5, 2 — 5. Ephes. 4, 11, 12. 1 Thes. 5, 12, 13. Christ being now set on Davids throne, as Christ himself is answerable to David, soPsal. 45, 16. Esa. 32, 1. 2 Chron. 19, 6, 10. with 1 Thes. 5, 12.13. 1 Tim. 5, 17. Hebr. 13.17. Mic. 4.2.8. and 5.5. Christs officers may be considered as ansvve∣rable to Davids, and Christs people to his: notvvithstanding the differen∣ces had betweene civill and ecclesiasticall estate, or other the like. 2. That not onely the universall, but every particular church now, is as Ierusalem, in a due consideration thereof. Whereunto therefore all carefull respect is to be had, in the Ministerie, vvorship, order & govern∣ment, in all things morall and perpetuall. Psal. 87, 2, 3. Esa. 66, 20— 23. Jer. 3.
15, 16, 17. Ezec. 44, 15 — 24. Mic. 4, 1, 2, 8. vvith Mat. 26, 17 — 29. 1 Cor. 5, 6, 7, 8. & 9, 13, 14. and 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11, 23 — 26. Rom. 12, 3 — 8. and 15, 16. Ephes. 4, 11, 12. Heb. 13, 8 — 17. Rev. 2. and 3. and 21 ch. &c. 3. That an Eldership, or Assemblie of Governours, for hearing and judging of causes betvveen brother and brother, is an ordinance of God, once established, and never repealed: and alway needfull to be had in the church of God. For vvhich see the Scriptures here before alledged in this and the former chapter. 4. That the Elders or Governours office it self, is also morall and per∣petuall: not first and newly begun in the time of the Gospell: but conti∣nued and derived from Israell to the churches of the Gospel, for the sub∣stantiall, divine, spirituall, and perpetual things belonging thereunto. For vvhich also see the Scriptures aforesaid. 5. That the grounds and duties of justice and good government, for righteous dealing and judging betvveen a man and his brother, are also morall and perpetuall. Ibid. 6. That the very phrases used by the Greek Septuagint, about the ca∣ses of death in Israell, are by the Apostle used and applied to cases of ex∣communication in the church of Corinth. 1 Cor. 5, 13. compared with Deut. 17, 7. and 19, 19. and 21.21. and 22.21. And among the Iewes themselues, vvhen they vvere under the heathen, and could not put any from among them by death, they did it by excommunication; &c. as M. Brough∣ton observeth in his larger Explication of Rev. 11.1.2. and 13, 11.12. pag. 109. and 177. and in some respect may be gathered by that vvhich is written Ioh. 18, 31. vvith 9, 22. and 12, 42. and Luk. 6.22. 7. That in Israell also, such Elders as before time sate in the gates, did aftervvard (when they vvere under the Romanes, and dispersed in divers countreyes) sit in their Councill houses and Synagogues. Where note withall, that their Synagogues vvere ecclesiasticall assemblies, in divers respects: as being such, where they mette together for the vvorship of God, for teaching and hearing of his vvord; vvhere Christ on the Sab∣bath dayes taught and preached the Gospell; and out of vvhich they ex∣communicated and cast out such as they cutte of from among them, &c. Mat. 4, 23. and 5, 22, and 6, 5. and 10, 17. Luk. 4, 16. and 6.22. Joh. 9 22.34. and 12.42. and 16.2. and 18, 20. Act. 13.14.15. and 15.21. and 17.1.2. and 18.4.7. and 19.8. and 22.30. and 24.12.20. &c. 8. And lastly, that otherwise we should transgresse the Second & Fift commandement: bringing in a nevv & straunge forme of government, not or deyned by the Lord: and giving way to many great evils in the church: as eyther on the one hand, to usurpation and tyranny; or on the other, to popular confusion, contention, despising of governours and go∣vernment, &c.Testimonie of auncient and late  Writers. Now hereunto also may be annexed the testimonie both of auncient and later Writers, touching the exposition of this Scripture. Among the auncient Writers, Chrysostome expounds it thus, Tell the church, that is to
say, the Leaders and Presidents of the church. Chrysost. on Mat. hom. 62. And Theo∣phylact likevvise, Tell the church, that is, tell the governours of the church. Theoph. in Mat. 18, 17. And among later Writers, Calvin, Beza, Iunius, Piscator & others vvriting upon this place, doe likewise expound it: teaching that Christ did here (as in other places) apply his speach to the custome and manner of the Ievves; & that the order vvhich was kept under the Law, Christ transferred unto us, because there is one common reason for us vvith the auncient Fathers, &c. See their comment. on Mat. 18, 17. And Bertrand de Loque vvriting of the Church, saith, The vvord Church is sometimes put for the Senate, or consistorie of the church, that is to say, for the Pastors and Elders of the church, who are in deed the conductours and guyders thereof: as when Iesus Christ saith, Tell the Church, that is to say, the Pastors, Leaders & Governours of the church: according vvhereunto we see, that S. Iohn making men∣tion of the consistorie of the Iewes, in which it was sometimes determined, to thrust out of the Synagogue every one that vvould canfesse Jesus Christ, he saith generally, that the Iewes made this decree, although it vvas in deed the Consistorie onely. Ioh. 9, 22. Bertr. de Loque his treatise of the church, pag. 3. M. Cartvvright also treating hereof, concludeth, that seeing the church (in Mat. 18.17.) is neyther the vvhole Congre∣gation, nor the Pastour alone, it followeth that by the church, he meaneth the Pastour, with the auncients or Elders. Or els (saith he) vvhom can he meane? And as for this maner of speach, wherein by the church is understood the chief governours and Elders of the church, it is oftentimes used in the old Testament: from the which our Saviour borrovved this maner of speaking: as in Exodus it is said, that Moses vvrought his miracles before the people, vvhen mention is made before, onely of the Elders of the people, vvhom Moses had called together. Exod. 4, 29, 30. And most manifestly in Joshue, where it is said, that he that killed a man at unvvares, shall returne unto the city, untill he stand before the Congregation to be judged. Iosh. 20, 4, 6. where by the Congregation, he meaneth the governors of the congregation for it did not apperteyne to all to judge of this case. Likewise in the Chronicles, & di∣vers other places. 1 Chron. 13, 2, 4. T. C. Reply 1. pag. 176. And M. Fenner teacheth the same, saying: Seeing our Saviour Christ, in setting dovvne the ecclesiasticall Presbyterie, speaketh according to the Iewes, for othervvise the Apostles could not haue understood him, vvhen he said, Tell the Congregation or Church,1 Chro. 13 2, 4. Beza on this place which vvas the title then giuen unto the ecclesiasticall Senate; and his words of having as a Publicane & Heathen, doeth manifestly proue, he meant to speak ac∣cording to their custome: It must needs be, that he did (according to the1 Tim 5, 17. Rom. 12.6.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. places afore brought) ordeyne a Presbyterie of Pastours, Teachers, and Elders, like unto theirs of Priests, Scribes or Teachers of the Law, and their Elders vvhich governed onely. Mar. 15, 1. Luke 22, 66. M. Fenners Counterp. pag. 138. And againe, Whatsoever offi∣ces are necessarie in everie Congregation for discipline, after the second private admoni∣tion, they are perpetuall: otherwise the remedie Christ hath appointed for sinners is not perpetuall. But an assembly of Governours in expresse words of Christ, are necessarie  everie congregation for discipline, after the second private admonition, Matth. 18, 17. Therefore such an assembly is perpetuall. Defence of the Counterp. against D. Copequo Sermon, B. 4. M. Vdall likewise hath the same, saying, Whatsoever Christ ba
ordeyned, as a meanes to keep men in obedience to the Gospell, that same must be in eve∣ry congregation: for particular men are in particular congregations: But Christ hath or∣deyned the Eldership for that end, as appeareth Mat. 18, 15. &c. where Chrysost. ex∣poundeth Tell the Church, that is (saith he) the governours of the church: Therefore the Eldership ought to be in every church. M. Vdals Demonst. chap. 14. And M. Brightman writing hereof, would haue this to be remembred, that the church (spoken of Mat. 18, 17.) is not the whole congregation, but the Synedrion or councill of certaine choise men. M. Bright. in Cant. 4, 3. Thus alsoIn his an∣swer to D. Bancrofts Sermon. p. 11.12. M. Penry expounds it. To conclude, M. Broughton saith, By Gods Law, Ecclesia, the Sanedrin court. should rule in all matters. M. Brough. on Rev. 11.3.4. pag. 119. Againe, The Gospel hath not a nevv discipline, but such as was in the Synagogues before Ezraes time, and vvhile Jerusalem stood. Quest. between M. Brough. and M. Ains. pag. 32. And final∣ly, Neyther the holy Gospell, nor holy Epistles, teach any thing for ecclesiastical govern∣ment, but as the holy Synagogues did. M. Brought. on Rev. 21, 6. pag. 303. And ma∣ny moe like testimonies might be alledged about this matter: but these may suffice. Another exposition also there is,III. Of the whole con∣gregation, things be∣ing caried orderly ac∣cording to good go∣vernment, &c. (though disliked by divers) vvhich yet in a good understanding may be admitted, so far forth as was or might be in Israell: namely, to take it of the vvhole Congregation, of Elders & people; so as things be caried according to order and the rules of go∣vernment. Whereabout these reasons likevvise may be considered. 1. That in Israell (where all doe graunt, there vvas a Congregation of governours appointed of God for hearing & deciding the causes afore∣said, yet) the people vvere not excluded, but might come, heare, except, assent, vvitnesse, execute, &c. And that therefore the Elders sate publike∣ly in the gates, Councill houses, Synagogues, &c. For which see the Scri∣ptures cited before in this and the former chapter. 2. That in these cases, the Scripture useth diversity of words: as some∣times Elders, Judges, Governours, Overseers, &c. Deu. 1, 16. and 16, 18. and 19.17. and 21, 19. and 22.15. 2 Chron. 19, 5. Act. 20, 17.28. Rom. 12, 8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. 1 Tim. 5, 17. Heb. 13, 17. 1 Pet. 5, 1. sometimes the Synedrion or sitting of the El∣ders, the Presbyterie or company of Elders, &c. Mat. 5, 22. Luke 22.66. Act. 22, 5, 30. and 23, 1, 6, 15, 28. and 24, 20. 1 Tim. 4, 14. and 5, 17. sometimes, the church, the congregation, the assembly, the Synagogues, &c. Iosh. 20, 3, 4. Num. 35, 12, 24, 25. Deu. 23, 1, 2, 3, 8. Psal. 26, 4, 5. and 82, 1. Prov. 26, 26. Mat. 10, 17. with 18, 17. 3. That the people in Israell executed and inflicted punishment on those, whom the Governours by the Lavv of God adjudged to death, scourging, banishment, &c. Lev. 74, 14 — 23. Num. 15, 33 — 36. Deu. 17, 7 — 12. and 19, 16 — 19. and 21, 18 — 21. and 22, 15 — 21. and 25.1, 2, 3, 9. 1 King. 21, 11, 12, 13. Ezra 7, 25, 26. vvherevvith also note and compare 1 Cor. 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13. 4. That in cases, vvhere things are expresly referred to the judgment of the Elders (as in Deu. 25, 5, 7, &c.) yet in the practise and observation thereof, vve find the people also to be present, and according to the pre∣sent occasions, to assent and beare witnesse, &c. Ruth. 4, 2 — 9.10.11. &c.
5. That the Apostle wrote to the church of Corinth, concerning the incestious person, how he had judged, in the Name of our Lord Ie∣sus Christ, when they vvere gathered together, and his spirit, vvith the povver of our Lord Iesus Christ, to deliver him unto Sathan: 1 Cor. 5, 3, 4, 5. And vvhen he vvas rebuked by many, upon his repentance also to forgiue him, and comfort him, and confirme their loue unto him, &c. 2 Cor. 2, 6, 7, 8. &c. 6. That neyther the authoritie of the Elders should abridge the liber∣tie of the people; nor the libertie of the people disanull or vveaken the authoritie of the Elders: but that both should be preserved and caried in good sort. For vvhich see the Scriptures here before alledged. 7. And finally, that all things of publike nature, apperteyning to the publike, be orderly, and according to the nature of them, publikly caried and handled, and duely also made knowen unto all: reserving and leaue∣ing to every one (both Governours and people) their right, power, in∣terest, duty, & liberty, about the hearing, examining, judging, vvitnessing, assenting, excepting, approving, executing, &c. so as is meet and right, according to the vvord of God, as was in Israell, and the Primitiue chur∣ches heretofore. Thus, vvhether the vvords aforesaid be understood of the Ievves Church, or of the Christians since, or both: vvhether of the Assembly of the Elders (not hindring or infringing any right or libertie of the people) or of the Congregation of Elders and people, so it be according to good order and the rules of government,M. Clift, Advertis. pag. 96. it cometh to a like end, being rightly understood: as upon occasion hath els vvhere ben shewed heretofore. And this clause of being rightly understood, is very needfull to be annexed & observed: because divers of good judgment think that these words are not to be understood of the whole Congregation, as by some of the te∣stimoniesPag. 312, 313. here before alledged may appear: also because it should wel be considered, hovv these vvords may fitly so be understood, or could so be in Israel, in such cases as here is spoken off, about hearing complaints, and judging of cases of sinne between brother and brother, &c. and spe∣cially, because that othervvise (if they be not rightly understood with due caution and limitation carefully) divers errours, abuses, and erroneous courses,M. Ains. M. Rob. M. Jacob. M. Smith, &c. by divers, haue ben gathered, received, pleaded for, and urged ernestly hereabout. As namely, 1. that this speach of Christ may not be understood of the Ievves Synedrion, nor of the Christian Presbyterie or Congregation of Elders novv; but that so to understand it, is errour & sinne. 2. That an Elder cannot with good conscience governe and per∣forme his duety in a church that is perswaded so to vvalk.Their er∣rours, abu∣ses, & sin∣full cour∣ses, &c. 3. That it ta∣keth avvay the power of the Church. 4. That it is to be understood of men women and children, in their owne persons, that can sorrow & re∣joyce, who are also bound in their owne persons to be present to hear & judge of causes and controversies between brother and brother. 5. And that the people are to haue voyces in excommunications, and in judging
of causes and persons, as in election of their Officers. 6. That in a con∣troversie, the sentence is to goe out according to the number of the voy∣ces of the greater part of the people, though al the Elders and other bre∣thren be against them. 7. That the greater part of the people is the church here spoken off, though they be in errour, and though that al the Elders & other brethren be against them therein, as is aforesaid. 8. That the members of any one church, are to haue voyces in every Church vvhere they come, in the elections and excommunications thereof, &c. 9. That the government is popular by the multitude. 10,That the kingdome of heauen, is a terme pe∣culiar onely to the chur∣ches of the Gospel, and not pertein∣ing to the church of the Iewes. Contrary to Mat. 22.2. & 21.43. & 8.12, &c. That the Elders may not admonish a sinner, though obstinate in transgression, (whereup∣on to proceed against him) without first taking the peoples consent so to admonish and proceed vvith him. 11. That it is a nevv rule, which could not be kept in Israel, when Christ spake it. 12. That the people now haue more povver in the government of the Church, then they had in Israell heretofore. 13. That they could not in Israel forgiue one anothers sinne, as vve can now. 14. That the people novv, are ansvverable to the Elders of Israell then. 15. That cases of sinne and controversie between man & man are to be heard and judged by the church on the Lords day, and as a part of Gods vvorship: vvhichM. Ains. Defence of Script. pag. 10. with his Annot. on Exo. 20 10. themselues graunt was not so in Is∣raell. 16. That the churches government is not Aristocraticall. 17. That the Elders may not heare and determine the cases aforesaid, unlesse the people be present, although the parties and vvitnesses be there ready to haue their matters heard & judged. 18. That the raynes of government in the church are not committed to the Elders. 19. That the Saints as kings rule the visible Church. 20. That the Eldership is not the head, in respect of the other brethren, as Paul speaketh of the head, 1 Cor. 12, 21. 21. That the people are Rulers properly, and the Governours of the El∣ders. 22. That persons will not accept of the admonitions giuen by the Pastour or other Elders, but say, if the Church admonish them, they will rest. 23. That they wil not giue honour to such erroneous government. 24. That the Ministers and Officers of the church are forreigne Ministers, a forreigne ayde and assistance, an unnaturall monstrous and adulterous interposition. 25. That ecclesiastical officers haue not offices of authori∣ty. 26. That the order of Saints or Saintship in the church is an order superiour unto and aboue the order of Officers, or of Bishoprick or El∣dership. 27. That the order of Saints is an order of kings (which is the highest order in the church) sitting upon the thrones of David for judge∣ment. 28. That Suspension is a corruption and devise of men. 29. That the Church of Israell had not power to cast out offenders. 30. That if there were amongst the Ievves in Christs time a distinct ordinance of ex∣communication ecclesiasticall, it vvas a Ievvish devise, & without ground of the Scriptures. 31. That no good writers use the vvord ECCLESIA for the Congregation of Elders: As if the Septuagint were not good vvriters; or that this may not be a Synechdochicall speach, as there are many in the Scriptures, Gen. 3, 20. and 9, 6. Exod. 20, 18, 19. with Deu. 5, 23. Lev. 9, 1, 3. in
the Septuagint. 1 Sam. 8.4, 7. &c. 2 Sam. 7, 7. with 1 Chron. 17, 6. Mar. 16, 15. Col. 1, 23. Iohn 9, 22. &c. or that GHNIDTAH were not the word used in the Sy∣riack; or that it were never used for the assembly of governors. 32. That this place may be understoodThe Pre∣lates, &c. of one alone, as of the Pastour or Bishop. 33. That by these opinions, Gods ordinance of the Synedrion, Consisto∣rie or Presbyterie is lost and abrogated. 34. And the difference between the Synedria or the Councils and the Synagogues annihilated or taken avvay. 35, That seeing the Elders are not called ARCHONTES in all the New Testament, therefore they are not to rule the church of God. 36. That if the Elders be stewards onely over the servants, and not Lords over the vvife (the church) then is not the church to obey or submit unto them: And that therefore it is a fallacie a conjunctione & divisione to reason thus; All the particular members must obey the Elders in their lavvfull instructions & their wholsome admonitions severally: Ergo the vvhole body (or whole flock) must joyntly obey the voice of the Elders, &c. These and other like errours, false doctrines, and sinfull courses haue ben conceived and urged by divers: not all by any one, but some by one, some by others: their toungues being exceedingly divided among them∣selues about these things. By vvhich also may appeare, how needfull it is to search out the meaning of this Scripture, and carefully to obserue it, still looking unto Israell, and to the right understanding thereof, what we can. And this the more, considering thatM. Ains. & his fol∣lowers, &c some are so very peremptorie & stifly conceited in their opinions concerning these things, as they fear not to make schismaticall divisions and notorious scandals thereabout, contrarie to the doctrine, vvhich vve haue learned of the Prophets and Apostles. For vvhich cause, they are to be marked and avoyded of all, that loue the trueth, and seeke their conversion and amendement. Rom. 16, 17. with 1 Cor. 11, 18, 19. Gal. 5, 19, 20. Ephes. 5, 11. Iude ver. 19. CHAPTER XX. Of the maintenance of the Ministers and other officers of the church. VVHether it be not the duty of all Churches, and of the members thereof, every one, according to their abilitie, to giue main∣tenance unto their Ministers, and (as there is occasion) to the Elders also that rule the church, & to the Deacons & Deaconesses that serue & minister therein. 1 Cor. 9, 7 — 14. Gal. 6, 6. Rom. 15, 27. 1 Thes. 5, 12, 13. 1 Tim. 5, 3, 17, 18. compared with Exod. 20, 12. Prov. 3, 9, 10. Lev. 24, 8, 9, Num. 18, 8 — 32. Deu. 12, 19. and 16, 16, 17. and 18, 1 — 8.

And thus we shall honour the Lord vvith our substance: which hath the promise of blessing from the Lord. Prov. 3, 9, 10. Ezec. 44, 30. Mal. 3, 8 — 12. with Exod. 20.12. and 1 Tim. 5, 17. 3. Besides that it is no great thing, but our duty to minister unto them in carnall things, of whose spirituall things vve are made partakers. 1 Cor. 9, 11. Rom. 15, 27. Gal. 6, 6. 1 Thes. 5, 13. 4. Yea vvho planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Or who fedeth a flock, & eateth not of the milk of the flock? 1 Cor. 9, 7. &c. 5. Finally, the Apostle teacheth expressely, Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine. For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not mousell the oxe that treadeth out the corne: and, The labourer is vvorthy of his reward. 1 Tim. 5, 17, 18. vvith Deu. 25, 4. 1 Cor. 9, 8, 9, 10. Mat. 10, 10. But vvhere any churches are poore, and not able to maintaine them∣selues, their Officers, or poore among them: that there they should be holpen by other churches of better meanes and greater abilitie; accord∣ing to their several estate and occasions. 2 Cor. 8, and 9 cha. Act. 11, 27 — 30. Rom. 15, 25, 26, 27. Gal. 2, 9, 10. and 6, 10. Phil. 4, 10— 19. together vvith the Scri∣ptures aforesaid. It doth in deed lye also upon Kings and all other Magistrates (within their dominions, cities, & jurisdictions) to haue special care of the estate of the ministers and churches under them, as of all other duties concer∣ning religion apperteyning unto them: after the example of Hezekiah king of Iudah, and Nehemiah the Prince, and other the like. 2 Chron. 31, 2 — 21. vvith 29, and 30 chap. Nehem. 10, 32 — 39. and 12, 44 — 47. and 13, 10— 14. vvith Deu. 17, 18, 19, 20. Yet notvvithstanding, this should not hinder the foresaid duty of the churches and people themselues: but should rather further it: and that not onely in affording help where there is want; but also in requiring of such as are able, that this duety be carefully perfor∣med by themselues, where by the flock and church it self it can be done: according to the examples aforesaid. This poynt concerning the Ministers maintenance is the more to be observed, that not onely care may be had for such as are faithfull and la∣borious, to be encouraged in the Lavv of the Lord, but that (vvhat in us is) the way may be stopped, and the meanes taken away of mainteyning Popish Priests, and other erroneous Ministers: vvho are vvoont often (vvhere Antichristian or other corruptions prevaile) to succeed and come after such as are sound in the faith, and to be taken into their places: and so to haue the same maintenance, as the other had before. Besides that where the Ministers haue their maintenance onely of the Magistrates, it may be a meanes to drawe such as are weak or not syncere, to carry themselues in their Ministerie and religion, so as may please the Magi∣strates, by vvhom they are mainteyned: eyther being unsound in the

Seing the second commandement forbiddeth not onely the Images themselues in the service of God, but all their appurtenances: as their maner of worship, altars, priests, chappels, Temples, sacrifices, vestments, feast dayes, &c.

And in Israel it sufficed not to remoue the Images and Altars alone, but they were also bound to abandon the Idol houses, & not to use them at all for sacrifice to the Lord: in stead of vvhich sacrifices, we haue now the Lords supper: as hath upon other occasion ben noted here before. 1 Cor. 10.16.17.18. Deu. 12.2.3.4.5.6.7.13.14. and 16.2.5.6. 2 King. 15.35. 2 Chron. 33, 17. vvith Exod. 20, 4.5.6. 3. The reformed Churches also now blame the Lutherans for reteyn∣ing Images and Altars still in their Temples, vvhenas they reteyne the Idoll temples themselues. In which respect they should be the more carefull hereabout. Or if the case be such that some of these things be rejected (as the Ima∣ges, Altars, vestments, &c.) and some reteyned (as the Temples, & chap∣pels, &c.) and some churches (being otherwise wel freed from Antichrists corruptions) cannot be perswaded but that these are lawfull, or at least
tolerable to be kept still: vvhether then the ministers or members of such churches, disallowing them, may therefore leaue those churches in this behalf, after they haue used all good meanes of perswasion and dealing thereabout. Or whether they, and other churches also that doe not ap∣proue or use them, should now rather (with protestation or other like signification of their mynd) beare vvith them, and be borne with also, in these and the like differences; vvayting till it please God to reveale or vvork further, as he seeth to be best; and still endevouring to growe up in the truth, and to nourish mutuall loue and peace one vvith another; & (vvhat they can) to haue communion in the things, vvhereof both are persvvaded, or vvherein they shall not themselues personally offend, and pertake with other mens sinnes. For vvhich see also the Scriptures afore∣said, and compare vvith them, Psal. 122.6 — 9. Prov. 23, 23. Eccles. 7, 16, 17, 18. Mar. 9.38.39.40.50. Act. 21.18 — 26. 1 Cor. 4.6.7. and 9.19 — 23. and 11.16. 2 Cor. 13.8. Ephes. 4.1 — 13. Phil. 2.1 — 4. and 3.15.16. 1 Tim. 5.22. 2 Tim. 2.13. Rev. 2. and 3 chap. And this the more to be thought upon, seeing that novv there is not any one place holy, and peculiarly consecrate to the ministration of the Lords supper, as there was of old for sacrifice onely at Ierusalem. 2. So as now therefore a place being a generall circumstance that per∣teyneth to all actions, it hath in this case (as clothes also haue) a civill use, commodious and necessarie for people to meet in together, and to be kept from injurie and unseasonablenes of the vveather, &c. 3. And sundry things and persons there are, which being not taken avvay by the Magistrates (as they ought to be) men may haue a good & lawfull use of them, so long as they are suffered to remayn. Deu. 13.12 — 18. Mat. 5, 32. 1 Cor. 5, 1, 2, 13. vvith 2 Cor. 2, 6, 7, 8. Here therefore may for the premisses be considered that Corollarie, which M. Gomarus hath at the end of his disputation, touching the civill Magistrate: vvhere he commeth thus farre, that he saith, the godly magi∣strate ought not, neyther can with good conscience permit to the Papists that liue in his dominion and are subject unto him, to haue the use of the Temples for exercise of their idolatrous vvorship, and preaching of hereticall doctrine: but rather if they haue any they are eyther to be demolished and overthrovven together vvith all Idols and false worship, or at least they are to see them purged, and all superstitions to be removed and taken avvay.

VVHether the having & using of a set Leitourgie prescribed to the Ministers for the celebration of mariage, as for other dueties of their calling, may not argue, that it is counted as a part of their ministe∣rie
and ecclesiasticall function: whereas it is a civill thing, in the nature thereof: and accordingly to be used with thankesgiving: being sanctifi∣ed by the vvord of God and prayer: as the Apostle speaketh in another case of meates; (vvhich in another respect also he speaketh off, together vvith mariage) 1 Tim. 4.4.5. And vvhether the solemnization of mariage should not therefore be done, by the Fathers or Tutors of the parties maried; or by the civill Magistrate; rather then by the Ministers, as a part of their ecclesiasticall administration. Gen. 2, 22.23.24. and 29.21.22. Ruth 4, 1 — 13. 1 Cor. 7, 2. Heb. 13, 4. with 2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. 1. Because we find not in the Scriptures, that it is a part of the eccle∣siasticall administration, layd upon the Ministers by the vvord of God, as a peculiar dutie of their Ministerie. Or if it were, then should the parents and Magistrates offend, taking upon them to doe a speciall vvork of the Ministerie, vvhensoever they should joyne any together in the band of mariage. The contrarie whereof may appeare, by the foresaid places of Scripture, and other the like. 2. And it appeareth, that of old it might be done by the Fathers, Tu∣tors, or civill Magistrates: Gen. 29, 21, 22. and, 41, 45. Ruth 4, 1 — 13. with Heb. 13, 4. And there is no Law giuen since to the contrarie. 3. Moreover, Mariage is honourable among all: and the bed undefi∣led. And the very nature and institution of Mariage is such, as it apper∣teyneth unto all, and not onely to the members of the church: but unto al others, of whatsoever religion or cōdition they be, euen to the Turkes and Pagans, &c. Heb. 13.4. 1 Cor. 7.2.12.13. Luke 9.60. Gen. 39.1.9. &c. 4. Els, vvhere there were not the Ministers and Churches of Christ, there could not be had any lawful mariages: as among the Heathens, &c. The contrarie whereof may be seen, Heb. 13, 4. compared vvith Gen. 39.1.9. Ester 1.9.17.20. Mat. 27.19. 5. And the Papists, who think that Matrimonie is a Sacrament, are the more confirmed in their errour: vvhiles they see that the solemnization thereof is by the Protestants annexed to the Ministerie of the vvord, and required to be done of the Ministers, in the churches meetings, by a pre∣scribed Leitourgie, as if it were a part or peculiar duety of their ecclesia∣sticall ministration. But if that it be not so required, as a peculiar duty of the Ministerie, thē on the other hand consider, vvhether it may not also be solemnized by the Ministers, asvvell as by others, and a blessing by them be pronounced upon the maried persons: so as it be not imposed upon them, as of neces∣sitie, nor observed vvith superstition. CHAPTER XXIII. Of the generall duety of all Churches and people (in these parts) concerning Religion. VVHether we ought not to leaue the present estate of the church of Rome, and to returne againe to the auncient estate of the same
Church, and of the other primitiue churches, in the integrity thereof, as they vvere first planted by the Apostles: And then also, Whether al chur∣ches and people (vvithout exception) are not bound to receiue and sub∣mit unto that Faith in religion, and to that constitution, Ministerie, wor∣ship, & order of the church, vvhich Christ as Lord & king hath appoin∣ted thereunto: and not to any other devised by Man vvhatsoever. Rom. 11.17 — 22. 2 Thes. 2, 3, 4. and 1 Tim. 4, 1, 2, 3. and 2 Tim. 3.1 — 5. and Revel. 14.6 — 12. and 18.4, 5, 6. and 19, 1 — 9. and 21, and 22 chap. compared with the Epistle to the Romanes: and with Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. Act. 1, 3. and 2, 42. and 3, 22 — 26. and 5, 31. and 6, 1 — 6. and 14, 23. and 15, 1 — 35. and 20, 17, 28. and 21, 18 — 22. 1 Cor. 4, 17. and 5 chap. and 10, 16, 17, 18. and 11 chap. and 12, 4, 5, 6, 28. and 14 chap.

Ioh. 3.36. and 14.6. 1. Because the church of Rome was at first rightly set in the faith and way of Christ: and is since fallen into great and deepe apostasie; which the Lord hath begun to discover and consume by the light of his word; and from vvhich he calleth all his people, to returne to the auncient way, to keepe the commandements of God, and faith of Iesus, Rom. 1, 7, 8. &c. throughout that Epistle: compared with 2 Thes. 2, 3 — 8. 1 Tim 4, 1, 2, 3. Rev. 8, and 9, and 10, and 11, and 12, and 13, and 14, 1 — 12. &c. throughout the book of the Re∣velation: with which also compare the Scriptures here noted before, and other the like. 2. The Lord also hath promised not onely to consume the man of sinne, to condemne the vvhore of Rome, and destroy the Beast, and false Prophet that seduced the world: but also to raise up his Church again to the former integritie, and to set up the nevv and heauenly Ierusalem in the auncient beautie thereof. Which all therefore should further (what in us is) and endeavour to attaine unto: being assured that such as come nearest to the synceritie of the Primitiue Churches (both in the faith, and order thereof) they are in the best estate: and that the nearer and nearer vve come thereunto, it is still the greater blessing of God upon us, and the more acceptable to God, and comfortable to our selues: hovv ever it be with us othervvise for our estate and troubles in the vvorld: as was also the lot of the Primitiue churches of old. For vvhich, see the Scriptures before alledged. 3. The like may be observed in other such cases of apostasie, that were in Israell heretofore: hovv the vvoonted course of God still was to call his people from such estate, to the auncient way of integrity, wherein at first he had set them: And that the godly haue also (in their several ages and occasions) ben carefull to hearken to the Lord, and to returne and practise accordingly: though some vvith more vveaknes and wants then others. Hos. 14, 1, 2, 3. Amos 5, 4, 5, 6. Jer. 6, 16. Esa. 8, 11 — 20. and likewise in o∣ther of the Prophets: compared vvith the historie of Israell, in sundry ages and cases: as
with Iudg. 2, 1 — 5,  1 Sam. 7, 3 — 6. 1 King. 12, 26 — 33. and 13, and 14 ch. &c. with 2 Chro. 11,  6. and 14, & 15, & 17, & 29, & 34 ch. with 2 King. 22, & 23 ch. Ezra 3, and 9, and 10 ch. Nehem. 13 chap. 4. And there is still but one vvay of trueth, and of the true service and syncere vvorship of God: And that in Christ, vvho onely is the vvay, the truth, and the life. Joh. 14, 6. and 17, 17. And all are bound (wholly & con∣tinually) to that faith, vvhich was once (for all) giuen unto the Saints: & that so, as if an Angell from heauen should teach otherwise, vve might not receiue it, but ought to hold him accursed. Jude, v. 3. 1 Tim. 6, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14. and 2 Tim. 1, 13. and 2, 2. Gal. 1, 8, 9. 5. Also the constitution, ministerie, worship, and order appointed by the Lord, is that onely which hath the promise of blessing frō God. Mat. 28, 20. Whereas the refusall or deniall of submission to the Lord, maketh subject to the wrath and curse of God. Luke 19, 27. with Esa. 60, 12. Ioh. 3, 36. Rev. 14, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. and 22, 18, 19. 6. Els Princes and people might novv doe that, against the faith and ordinance of Christ, vvhich they might not doe in Israel heretofore, con∣cerning the faith and ordinance which then they had giuen them. Which were contrarie to the Scriptures, Heb. 3, 1 — 6. and 12, 28, 29. and 13, 8. with Deu. 4, 1 — 24. and 17, 18, 19, 20. Esa. 49, 22, 23. and 60, 3. vvith Rev. 21, 24. Be∣sides that Antichrist also should haue that yeelded unto him in the ordi∣nances of the church (the city and kingdome of Christ) vvhich no godly Prince will yeild unto him in the Common wealth: As to appoint lawes, offices, orders, &c. for the government and administration thereof. And it vvere also contrarie to 1 Tim. 6, 13, 14, 15, 16. Esa. 33, 22. 7. And vve should els hold our Religion at the pleasure of man, and not at the prescription and commandement of the Lord, vvho is king of kings, by whom Princes reigne, and under vvhom all are subject, to yeild obedience unto him: As we doe also look for salvation by him, Mat. 28, 18, 19, 20. with 15, 9. 1 King. 12, 26 — 33. with 2 Chro. 13, 8 — 12. Psa. 136. Deu. 4, 1, 2. and 12, 32. with 17, 18, 19, 20. Josh. 1, 8. Gal. 1, 8, 9, 10. Joh. 3, 36. Heb. 5, 9. Yet notvvithstanding this hindreth not, but that all persons, of every estate, both ecclesiasticall and civill, ought to be subject to the Princes & higher powers, in the Lord. Rom. 13, 1 — 7. Tit. 3, 1. 1 Pet. 2, 13 — 17. with Act. 4, 18, 19, 20. and 5, 27 — 32. And it is the duety also of Princes and Magi∣strates, to submit themselues and their scepters to the Lord Iesus Christ, who is Prince of the kings of the earth, and to see the truth of God main∣teyned, and his ordinances observed, in all things. Neyther may they at any hand or by any meanes be drawen to oppose any truth or ordinance of the Lord, nor to abridge the churches of any rights and benefits be∣longing unto them, nor intrude themselues into the peculiar dueties of the Ministers, &c. but must rule over men in the feare of God, doing no∣thing against the truth or vvay of Christ, but what they can for it: know∣ing that they are for the Lord, and under him: and remembring vvhat judgements came upon Ahaz, Ieroboam, Achab, and other such Kings
of Iudah and Israell, vvho sinned herein greatly against the Lord: and againe what blessings came upon David, Hezekiah, Iosiah, and the other good kings of Iudah, vvho were faithfull with the Lord in the service of his name. Psal. 2, 10, 11, 12. and 72 Psal. Josh. 1, 8. 2 Sam. 23, 3. 1 King. 12, 26, 27.33. and 13, and 14 ch. &c. 2 King. 16, and 17, & 17, & 18 ch. &c. 2 Chron. 19, and 28, and 29 chap. &c. Finally, let us here also obserue, thatLev. 4 ch.

Mat, 15, 9. Gal. 1, 8.9. Col. 2, 20, 23. no Princes, nor Prelates, Sy∣nodes, Churches, or any persons whosoever, can make that lawful, which God hath made unlawfull, nor that unlawfull vvhich God makes lawfull. ButEsa. 49, 22, 23. and 60, 3, 16. Rom. 13, 3. 1 Tim. 2, 1, 2, 3, 4. Act. 9, 31. Princes and Magistrates may graunt outward peace & help to the Church: for which (wheresoever it be had) we are bound to be thank∣full to God and them.

The Conclusion. NOw to conclude, let us in these questions, and the like, still obserue (what vve can) vvhat was prescribed and received in Israell of old, according to the writings of Moses and the Prophets: together vvith that which is recorded by the Apostles, touching the Primitiue churches since. And let us vvithall carefully reteyne and follow that manner of reasoning, vvhich is taken from the example and estate of Israell, and of∣ten also used in the Scriptures of the New Testament, how ever it be re∣jected, or litle regarded by divers, in respect of the use and account which all should make thereof. Which vve may learne by the Apostles manner of reasoning, when he saith, Behold Israell, &c. 1 Cor. 10, 18. Whi∣ther also may be referred the many answers, arguments, and reasons which Christ himself and the Apostles took from the estate of Israell, and from Moses and the Prophets, in sundry cases, from time to time. As may be seen in these and the like places: Mat. 9, 10— 13. and 12, 1 — 7. and 15, 1 — 9. and 19, 3 — 8. and 22, 23 — 32. Mar. 9, 43 — 49. Luke 4, 24 — 27. and

To the Law and to the testimonie: if they speake not according to this word, it is be∣cause there is no light in them. Esa. 8, 20. All Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for re∣proof, for correction, for instruction in righteousnes: that the man of God may be perfect, being throughly furnished unto every good work. 2 Tim. 3, 16, 17. Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tryed, he shall receiue the crowne of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that loue him. Iam. 1, 12. FINIS.
