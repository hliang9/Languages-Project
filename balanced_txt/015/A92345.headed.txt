A RELATION FROM ROME OF THE MASSACRE Committed upon the French Ambassadour And his LADY. With two Letters from the French King, one to the Pope, another to the Cardinal concerning the same. Published for satisfaction. LONDON, Printed in the Year. 1662.
The true Translation of what passed at the assassinate Enterprise against the French Ambassadour and his Lady at Rome the twentieth of August last. FOrasmuch as for some time immediately after a tumultuous disorder, all the discourses thereof are usually confused: It is necessary (if I may so speak) to let the news rest a little, that so it may have time to purifie it self; and seeing it is not easie, in the heat of an accident newly happened, that the first relations should be most true in all their circum∣stances; it is from the seconds that we must draw the certain discoveries; the knowledge of which truth having obliged the Duke of Crequin, Ambassadour extraordinary for the King of France at Rome, to make careful inquisition, in what manner all things passed in that Enterprise that was there acted; the roll past against him and the Embassadrix his Wife:
after an exact examination of all that hath been said thereof, by those of each party, two things have been observed; one, that many particulars of small con∣cernment happened somewhat different to what was first written, which is very ordinary in such ren∣counters; the other, that by many circumstances the business was yet more enormous then was at first advised, which is a thing unusual; the first rumour for the most part heightning and aggravating things above what they really are: to the end therefore that you may not want the very exactness in a business of this nature, it is thought fit to write this second rela∣tion, whereby the Reader, without doubt, will be astonished to see that in a City where the Spirit of peace should rejoyce, there hath been done con∣trary to the inviolable security of the publick faith, and right of Nations, an action so unheard of, that endeavours have been to assassinate in Rome persons whose quality is owned for sacred even in Constan∣tinople it self; and that in the place where the head of the Church resides, there hath been committed against the eldest Son of the Church, in the person of his Ambassadour, an attempt whereof there hath not been any example amongst the very Infi∣dels. On Sunday the twentieth of August about six of the clock at night, four men, which yet are un∣known whether they were French men or not, and four Souldiers Corses, having quarrelled together at the end of the Bridge called Pente septe, and having drawn their Swords, were presently parted
by a Frenchman, who came by, and caused them to put up their Swords into their sheaths. In this po∣sture they went on upon the Bridge, where being about the middle of the Bridge, there came to them eight or ten other Souldiers, who joyning with the four first, fell upon the five pretended Frenchmen, who presently putting themselves on their defence, forced their passage over the Bridge in despight of the Souldiers, and withdrew themselves hard by the Ambassadours stables. Some of the Ambassadours houshold Servants, with some of the Grooms, going out at the noise, and seeing people pursued with drawn Swords, beat back the Souldiers; but a great number coming, the Ambassadours people were dri∣ven back with musket-shot, even within the gate of the Pallace Farnese, where he dwelt. There was hardly then six persons in the house, the most part of his Gentlemen being gone abroad to walk, or to Duke Cesarini's, who had invited them to supper; the Ambassadrix being gone to her devotion at St. Bernard, and the Ambassadour also gone forth to see the Princess Borghese: Returning from whom, having taken leave of those that accompanied him, he came back with a very small train to his house, and went in on one side just at the same time as the Soul∣diers had beaten in his men on the other: As soon as he understood what past, he sent two or three Gen∣tlemen to cause them to withdraw; and they were no sooner out for this purpose, but seven or eight bullets were shot at them; then, as if the signal had been given, all the retainers to the Pallace were seized on by the Corses, who came thither with drums beat∣ing,
and placed thereabouts in a moment eight or ten Courts of guard: The Ambassadour at the news thereof went up into a Balcony, and presently they discharged many shots at him, whereof one killed an Italian under the windows of the Pallace; and after, for the space of an hour and an half, they cea∣sed not to shoot from all parts, whereof there are yet many marks on all sides of the Chambers. In the mean time, in all other parts of the City, the Souldiers likewise put themselves in Armes, crying that the Horse should advance to charge the French, amongst whom three Gentlemen of the Ambassa∣dours, having been set upon near the Pallace that is called d'Espagne, half a league from thence, had been killed, if they had not saved themselves at the Cardinals of Arragon. But it was not the Souldiers only that took Armes; the Sbirres or Sergeants themselves, to shew that all was done by express order, armed themselves also; and they which never shot on any occasion what∣ever, wounded in the place Navone, a Gentleman of the Ambassadours with a Musket in the belly; one of his Lacquies on the other side received a shot in his body, whereof he is dead; and his Pallace remained beset near three houres, without permitting any per∣son to stir. The Ambassadrix her self coming from Church, and being yet far off from her house, was stopt near Saint Charles de Getinari; but it is too lit∣tle to say she was stopt, seeing they endeavoured to kill her; the Souldiers that kept that post, having let passe the Coach of her Gentlemen, discharged se∣veral
shot at hers, killed a Page in the boot by her an Italian, who a little before believing himself safe by the Coach of the Ambassadrix of France, had advanced himself; out of curiosity to see her, was woundedd besides another of her Lacquies with a Crosse-bow shot upon the head. It is so amazing a deed, that one could not have dreamt that there should have been thoughts of such an attempt on the person of an Ambassadour and his Lady; one is even loth to speak it; but who can be silent, when on the one side we see her assassinated in this manner; and on the other, it is evident, that they shot at him, and that it is since said, there were seventeen Conses who had order to kill him! The Ambassadrix was constrained to divert half dead, and to save her self at the Cardinal d' Estes, where seeing there was no safety for her to go forth, she stayed a long time, and till she was reduced to capitulate with the Ser∣geants to let her passe. The Cardinal conducted her home himself, marching in his Chair just before her Coach. Behold here a true Narration of the thing as it passed, whereof the Ambassadours that were at Rome, and all Persons of honour uninteressed, can freely bear witness. Notwithstanding after this offence done to a King in the Person of his Ambas∣sadour, which cannot be expiated but by very great satisfactions, the Court of Rome hath used no endea∣vours to make any; yea she endeavoureth presently to palliate the business by Artifices and Disguise∣ments;
and publickly in a little time she will take the confidence to go further, and to seek Reasons to justifie it; but his Majesty hath this advantage, that if they do not give him the satisfaction which is due to him, and which he may expect, he is in a capacity to right himself.
Two letters of the King; One to the Pope; the other to the Cardinals; both dated 30. August, 1662. Most Holy Father, OUr very Dear and Well-beloved Cousin the Duke of Crequi our Extraordinary Ambassa∣dor, having given us to understand the assassinat com∣mitted on his person, and on Our Ambassadrix, and all the French, which were found the 20 Instant in the streets of Rome, at the meeting of your Holiness guard of Corses: Wee have presently sent order to our said Cousin to depart out of the Ecclesiastical Territories, to the end that his Person, and our Dig∣nity may not longer remain exposed to such attempts, whereof to this day, there hath been no examples amongst the very Barbarians; and wee have at the same time ordered Mr. De Barlemont Auditor of the Rote to know of your Holiness, if you approve of what your Soldiers have done, and whether you intend or not to make us satisfaction proportionable to the greatness of the offence, which hath not only violated, but unworthily overthrown the right of Nations. Wee demand nothing of your Holiness in this affaire; you have made it so long a custome to refuse us every thing, and have demonstrated to this
day such aversion, to that which respects our Person and Crown, that we judg it better to leave these re∣solution to your own prudence, according to which wee shall regulate ours; wishing only that those of your Holiness may be such as may oblige us to con∣tinue to pray to God, that he would conserved (most Holy Father) your Holiness in the Government of our Mother the Holy Church. MY Cousin, the assassinat committed the 20 in∣stant, on the person of my Cousin the Duke of Crequi my Embassador extraordinary, on his Lady, and on all the French, the Corse grand of the Pope could meet with that day in the streets of Rome, is addeed so enormous in all its circumstances, that nei∣ther any age, nor any people, how barbarous soever they have been, can furnish any example, when the right of nations hath been so so inhumanly violated and overturned. As you are a worthy member of that holy body, which is the natural counsel of the Popes, I have commanded Mr. De Barlemont Audi∣tor of Rote to visit you on this account, to let you know the just resentment that I have of so great an offence, to the end that your contributing thereto, as I doubt not but you will readily doe what is in your power, may cause me to obtain a reparation proportionable to the process of the injury; if your
Officers find themselves unable for this, there can be nothing (after this diligence) imputed to me of all those evills, and following mischises that this busi∣ness will draw after it, whereof I will protest (what ever happens) to be fully discharged before God and men; and referring, my self to what further shall be represented to you by word of mouth, by the said Mr. De Bourlemout, I pray God to have you my Cousin, in his Holy and Worthy protection. Written from St. Germain. FINIS.
