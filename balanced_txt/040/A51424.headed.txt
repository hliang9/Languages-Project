VTRIVSQVE ACADEMIAE CANTABRIG. & OXON. Praeclaris Luminibus ac Ornamentis, caeteris∣què Sacrae Theologiae Candidatis, & sin∣cerioris Literaturae Studiosis Gratiam & Salutem in CHRISTO IESV. SI quanto amoris studio Vtramque Academiam prosequor, tanto Honoris testimonio adornare eas possem (Ʋiri Clarissimi) certè quidem hoc qualecunqne Opus meum, vestro praesertim Nomini inscriptum, usque adeò excellens & singulare fuisset, ut nec ad con∣ciliandam gratiam, nec ad culpam deprecandam Prae∣fatione ullâ indigeret. In quo tamen si quae fortè Vobis occurrant (ut sunt sanè plurima) à nullo hactenùs, ex nostris partibus, Authore praevio in medium prolata; vestrae perspicacitatis erit, quanti momenti illa fuerint, dijudicare; quorum duntaxat Apices aliquot saltem at∣tingere operae-precium esse duxi. Sacramento Eucharistiae Resp. Christiana nihil un∣quam sublimius, nihil sanctius habuit atque Augustius,
quo Christiani quodammodò in Christum ipsum transfor∣mamur. Huic Institutioni in frontispicio libri, ex aliorum Placitis, MISSAE cognomentum adjicio: quam vocem a∣liquis fortassis omissam nimis velit. Quin esto tu bono ani∣mo, quisquis es pius zelôtes, & Papisticae Missae exosor vehemens. Etenim nomen [Missa] secum omen suum apportat, quod cum à Dimittendis ijs, qui Eucharistiae participes esse nolunt, ortum suum traxerit, Romanam Missam planè jugulat, quae (veluti Amasios suos) Spe∣ctatores meros omnibus lenociniis ad se allicit at{que} invitat; ac si in illo uno Theatrico spectaculo Religio ipsa Christi∣ana ferè tota consisteret: quos tamen (modò Eucharistiae capaces) Antiquitas Catholica apud Graecos , apud Latinos Discedere jussit; et in persistentes, ut in homines praefractos & impudentes, graviter acerbe{que} invecta est. Haec de Operis Titulo praefari mihi libuit, nè in isthoc vo∣cabulo, Missae, veluti in ipso vestibulo, impegisse videar. Ex parte Operis primâ, quam Practicam dicimus, constat Institutionis Christi Canones decem, per Tri∣dentinos Canones, in Romana Missa, perfringi (tantumnon jugiter) et violari; sed majorinè impudētiâ, an impietate, difficile est dicere: nam Depravationibus istis sufflaminandis mille annorū Consuetudini universali anteponūt sequioris aetatis Diutissimè, scilicet, retentam (ut aiunt) trecentorum annorum modernae Ecclesiae Romanae (en!) sapientioris usum contrarium. De∣inde Praeceptum praximque Apostolicam à Pontifice Rom. Abrogari posse garriunt: quin & adversus Exemplum Christi, multis retrò seculis vel ab ipsis Rom. Pontificibus sanctè religiose{que} observatum, ob∣tendunt Consuetudinem contrariam habendam esse
pro lege: quin porrò hoc quo{que} parum est, quià, quamvis de contrario Praecepto Christi constaret, nihilo-minùs Ius ipsum divinum à Pontifice Romano re∣laxari posse, Iesuita blasphemo ore pronunciat. Sequitur pars altera, quam Dogmaticam nomina∣mus, in multa Membra se diffundens, ità tamen ut ho∣rum verborum Christi [HOC EST CORPVS ME∣VM, &c.] {fleur-de-lys} Quâ quidem Parti∣cusâ integram Institutionis Christi narra∣tionem (Insti∣tutionis, inquā, non autem Ro∣manae, ut dici∣tur, Consecra∣tionis formam) disertis verbis significavi. Ex quâ tamen mi∣rum quantos clamores exci∣tavit Papista quidam, vit sa∣nè nobilis: cu∣jus Postulatis justo quodam Tractatu (qui Anglicè inscri∣bitur A Dis∣charge) atis superque factū est. {fleur-de-lys} &c.] Expositioni literali Mysterij Romani de Eucharistia moles tota nitatur. Quanquàm dum in istis explicandis Adversarij nonnulli, Fridentinorum Patrum spiritu afflati, Tropum omnem ab eisdem longè exulare jubent; Alij tamen Tropos saltem Sex, velint nolint, coguntur agnoscere. Porrò, in una Particula [HOC] totius Controversiae cardo vertitur; de qua cum quaeritur, quid ea proprie designet, Pontificij Do∣ctores in duas, eas{que} contrarias Opiniones distrahuntur Alij enim per, Hoc, Christi corpus denotari volunt; Alij ad aliud (quod ipsi commenti sunt) Individuum Vagum Pronomen illud referunt: ità tamen ut utri{que} Andabatarum more, à se invicèm vapulent, dùm hi pri∣orem sententiam prorsus Absurdam, illi posteriorem Absurditatum plenam non dicunt modò, verum-etiam solidis Argumentis evincunt. Iam igitur, hoc uno fun∣damento ipsorum Pontificiorum Contradictionibus (ut olim Turre Babel) diruto at{que} dejecto, alia de Transsubstantiatione, de Corporali Christi Praesen∣tia, Conjunctione què cum corporibus Communi∣cantium, de propriè dicto Sacrificio, & de divina deni{que} Adoratione, superstructa portentosa Dogmata omnia corruere & labefactari necesse est. De singulis, si pla∣cet, pauca delibemus.
Primo in loco Transsubstantiationis non Dogma modò, sed & vox ipsa (contra quàm pisces) novitate sua foetet. Ecquid habent, quod opponant? nonnihil, nempè, Patres antiqui (inquiunt) de Conversione hujus Sacramenti verba facientes, Transformationis, Tran∣sitionis, Transmutationis, Transelementationis voca∣bula frequenter usurpârunt: unde ipsissimam suam Transsubstantiationem dilucidè probari gens Romana clamitat & vociferatur. Cum tamen Adversarios no∣stros minimè lateat, eosdem Sanctos Patres pari liberta∣te sermonis judicij{que} synceritate easdem voces singulas ad alias conversiones transtulisse, ut (Exempli gratiâ) nunc Verbi praedicati in Auditorem, nunc Corporis Chri∣sti in Ecclesiam, nunc hominis Christiani in Christum, nunc deni{que} Corporum Christianorum in ipsam Chri∣sti carnem. Vndè sequitur, ut quâ ratione praeclari isti Disputatores unam duntaxat Transsubstantiationem astruere conantur, eâdem ex ipsa lege Parium (ô homi∣nes miserè fascinatos, alios{que} miserrimè fascinantes!) quatuor alias teneantur admittere. In Membro tertio partis Dogmaticae quaestio de Cor∣porali praesentia Christi in Eucharistia agitatur, quae{que} hùc pertinent omnia ad hoc unum Caput reducuntur; Quid sit illud, quod, juxta Christi institutionem, jam in∣telligitur [Corpus meum?] Hoc Catholica Ecclesia per multa Secula, ab Apostolicis us{que} temporibus, nullum aliud esse credidit, quàm quod à B. Virgine Natum, Vnum, Vno in Loco Definitum, seu circumscriptum, Organicum quoque, & demum Sensuum omnium absolutissimâ integritate juxtà & Gloriae perfectione cumulatissimâ praeditum. At quod Romanenses Car∣bonariis
suis Discipulis obtrudunt, Deus bone! quale Corpus, & quàm minimè illud MEVM? Primò (id enim natura Transsubstantiationis necessariò exigit) Corpus, quale Pistores pinsunt, ex pane confectum; mox Corpus (nam{que} hoc discontinuitas locorum per se postu∣lat) multiplex, quale Geryonis illud fuisse fingitur: post, Corpus, (quià non definitivè in loco) quale esse nullum potest, Infinitum: dein Corpus, (quià totum in qualibet parte Hostiae) quale quis vix somniare potest, Paraphysicum: insuper Corpus (ut ipsi aiunt) omni movendi, sentiendi, intelligendíque facultate destitu∣tum, id est, coecum, surdum, exanime: Corpus deni{que} nullis non sordibus cuiusvis sterquilinij, & locorum, quae honestè nominari non possunt, inhonestissimorū obnoxium. Qualia Opinionum portenta, ut omninò Haeretica, veteres Patres semper execrati sunt. Verùm enim verò diversarum aetatum subrancidas Historias, si numeremus, Tredecim proferunt, in quibus memoria de verissimae carnis, verissimique sanguinis Christi in Eucharistia Apparentiâ verissimâ Lectoribus cōmendatur. In quibus Miraculis, tanquam in Dei testi∣moniis omni exceptione majoribus, Adversarij nostri miri∣ficè gloriantur; et dici vix potest quantoperè miseros mor∣tales hâc unâ Persuasione suâ dementârint: cùm tamen haec verissima, scilicet, si ponderentur, vanissima esse sin∣gula cuivis liquere possit. Quem in finem bonis illis Histo∣ricis valedicentes, rectà Scholas petimus, exploraturi an Scholastici eandem insanierint insaniam. Hi tantum abest ut istis Legendariis fidē assensionem vè praebeant, ut in ejusmodi Apparitionibus vel veram carnem Chri∣sti, vel omninò veram carnem inesse ausint non pernegare
modò, verum-etiam contrariam hanc suam sententiam ex∣quisitis Rationibus defendere. Quanquā quid horū proba∣tione opus est? quandoqudē nemo ferè est tàm mucosis na∣ribus (modònon sensus suos prorsus obstruat) cui non subo∣leat, imò qui non eas legēdo planè odoretur, et persentiscat has fabulas à maleferiatis hominibus anilitèr esse confictas. Quartò, In Corporali sua (ut vocant) Christi con∣junctione cum Corporibus Communicantium ni∣hil aliud cernere licet quàm Capernaiticam quandam stupiditatem; quoties Pontificios audimus antiquas suas canere Cantilenas: se nimirùm Dentibus terere, guttu∣ribus deglutire, hoc est, ut nos quidem interpretamur, verè devorare; atque insuper hominum visceribus per∣miscere; & tandem (adsit verbo reverentia) in seces∣sum egerere; imò tàm canum, muriumque, nec non vilis∣simi cujusque animalis intestinis, quàm ullius etiam san∣ctissimi viri, qui illius particeps esse potest. Quis deinceps miretur fuisse olim, qui Philosophos se dicerent, qui asse∣rebant, Nivem sibi atram videri, Coelum consistere, & Terram motione suâ eâ{que} perpetuâ rotari? Hosce scopulos praetervecti, in Contentionum labyrin∣thum dilabimur, de Sacrificio Missae, tot Amphibolo∣giis & verborum involucris, tot Opinionum Antilogiis, ceu viarum anfractibus, & sinuosis Maeandris undique implicitum, ut absque commoda aliqua Distinctione diffi∣ciles, imò impossibiles habeat explicatus: eò{que} magis, quòd apud veteres Patres (ut quod res est libere fateamur) de Sacrificio Corporis Christi in Eucharistia Incruento frequens est mentio: quae dici vix potest quantopere quo∣rundam, alioqui Doctorum hominum, ingenia exercue∣rint, torserint, vexaverint; aut econtrà quam jactanter
Pontificij de ea re se ostentent: cum tamen hic nodus uno hoc Distinctionis quasi cuneo facilè diffindatur. Vox, Corpus Christi, dupliciter sumitur, vel ut Subjectum Celebrationis Eucharisticae, vel ut ejusdem Corporis Ob∣jectum. Si Subjectivè accipiatur pro eo, cui externa Ac∣cidentia insunt, tùm non potest non Corporalem Prae∣sentiam Christi designare: sin verò Objectivè tantùm, habitâ Relatione ad Christi corpus, vel ut olim in cruce pendentis, vel ut nunc in coelo regnantis, Praesentiam dun∣taxat Symbolicam declarat; quoniam Objectum, licet rei cruentae, ut in Scena, ipsum est tamen Incruentum. Id quod sex Argumenta, è veterū Patrum testimonijs de∣prompta, dilucidè demonstrant. Eadē igitur Distinctione quivis poterit ità prorsùs , ut non habeant quod contrà mussitent. Quid? quod praetereà etiam Ro∣mana Missa Grandis Sacrilegij rea arguitur. Ad extremum, extremae & nefandae Idolomaniae Rom.  ipsum, quae est Sacramenti Eucharistiae divina Adoratio, in medium protrahitur; ubi id, quod adorant, Posse esse adhuc Panem, propter ferè infini∣tos Defectus, ipsi Adversarij ultrò concedunt: & Nos, Non posse illud non panem esse, juxta Veterum sen∣tentiam, Rationibus circiter sexdecim evicimus: at{que} etiam quas Adorandi Formulas, ceu Praetextus, excu∣sationis ergò, sibi tanquam larvas induxerunt, illis de∣traximus, ut vultus eorum deformes horridi{que} appareant; us{que} eò ut illi Idololatricâ impietate Ethnicos aequare, Excusationis verò futilitate longè superare videantur. Quid tandem? tota ferè Missae defensio Manichae∣orum, Eunomianorum, Marcionitarum, Eutychia∣norum, aliorum{que} multorum Haeresibus scat et passim,
ut in postrema nostra Synopsi, veluti in speculo, contem∣plari quivis poterit. Dùm ista literis consigno, ostendun∣tur mihi, inter alias, Theses duae, quas Isaacus Casau∣bonus: in Adversarijs suis, propriâ manu scriptis, post se reliquit. Prima; Iusta Causa est (inquit) cur Transsubstantiatio rejiciatur, ut evitentur Absurda. Altera haec est; Veteres nunquam dixerunt destrui Symbola, sed semper de Signis locuti sunt, quasi de re ipsa. Quae quàm verae sunt, & juxta Veterum sententiam ad Causam nostram oppidò necessariae, nostri muneris erit suo loco copiosè ostendere. Priusquàm verò perorare mihi liceat, vos orandi estis (Viri ornatissimi) ut de Adversari∣orum nostrorum Iniquitate, de meo{que} erga vos studio ac Benevolentia nonnihil attexam. Bellarmino, Alano, Maldonato, alijs{que} Romanae Missae Assertoribus suum, ut par est, ingenij acumen, ex∣actum & perspicax judicium, omnium deni{que} tàm huma∣nae quàm divinae literaturae accuratam cognitionem facilè tribuimus; ità tamen ut in ijs, dùm nostros Theologos criminantur, veritatem; dum suas opiniones defendunt, constantiam; dùm Patres, Patres crepant, objectant, incul∣cant, fidem modestiam{que} desideremus. Ʋt nihil de Eorum Iuramentis dicamus, quibus se obstrinxerunt, non sine a∣liqua notâ Perjurij; quod Synopsis nostra Secunda satis super{que} declarat. Ad nostram quod attinet Sacratissimā Eucharistiam; quia à Ministro Elementa consecrantur et benedicuntur, non minùs Sacramenta sunt, quàm est aqua Baptisma∣tis; quae tamen istos non pudet probris suis contaminare, dum partem alteram merum Pistoris panem, alteram Oenopolae vinum nudum appellant nequitèr. Deindè
(ut alias eorum Calumnias praetervolem) quòd eorum de Corporali Christi Praesentiá in Eucharistiâ fanaticam Opinionem, tanquàm Impossibilem, propter implicitam Contradictionem, oppugnamus; Isti, quasi hoc esset Dei Omnipotentiae detrahere, in nos impotentèr debacchan∣tur. Si cui lubeat singulas Operis hujus Sectiones percur∣rere, vix in aliquam incidet aut Objectionem Adversari∣orum pro sua Missa, aut Responsionem, aut deni{que} Scrip∣turae expositionem quam non facilè observet ab aliis Pon∣tificiis Doctoribus aut luculentâ ratione solutam, ener∣vatam, explosam; aut deni{que} (quod majus est) per receptas Ecclesiae Romanae doctrinas oppugnatam. Nae illae prae∣clara est istorum hominum constantia, qui si minùs viribus nostris, suâ tamen imbecillitate & dissensione vincuntur, at{que} succumbunt. Praetereà de Pontificiorum Doctorum Versutia Obstinacia{que} satis queri vix possumus. Versutia eorum cernitur cùm in rebus aliis, tùm praecipuè in abutendis veterum Patrum Testimoniis, sive per falsas Editiones Translationes{que} ea dépravando; sive novo excogitato Commento illudendo; sive deni{que} adversis frontibus oppugnando: quorum omnium Exempla plurima Libri singuli sequentes vobis exhibent. Obstinaciae verò eorum specimen nullum potest esse illustrius, quàm (quod in altera Synopsi nostra videre est) ex Veterum senten∣tiis factâ Collatione Eucharistiae cum Baptismate. Illi ad sua Dogmata stabilienda, de Praesentia Corporali Corporis Christi in Eucharistia, ipsius{que} adeò Adoratione Latreutica, objiciunt Nobis, Patres negâsse Eucha∣ristiam esse nudum Panem. Nos reponimus, eosdem Patres paritèr negâsse, in Baptismate esse Aquam nu∣dam.
At opponunt, Veteres Eucharistiam Sacrificium vocâsse. Nos rursùs, Baptisma quo{que} Sacrificium no∣minant. Illi, At apud Patres Eucharistia Sacramentum Terribile, & Venerabile dicitur. Regerimus nos, à Pa∣tribus moneri homines ad Baptisma, utpote quod Vene∣randum sit, cùm Tremore accedere. Pergimus dein, & per sexdecim  par pari referimus, quod Adversa∣riorum nostrorū, nisi animos obfirment, Conscientias mor∣deat & lancinet; sed manu tamen medicâ, ut sanet. Eant igitur Antagonistae nostri, &, cum de Antiquitate agitur, nos (ut solent) Novatores appellitent, nunquàm tamen efficient, quin ipsi (ut praeclarè olim Clariss. vir Iosephus Scaliger) Veteratores habeantur. Redeo ad Vos tandem (dignissimi Viri) quorum inti∣mos animorum conceptus audire mihi videor: quibus quoad possim, & liceat, occurrendum esse duxi. Primo in loco; Fateor equidem me jamdiù in istiusmodi Po∣lemicis negotiis exercuisse calamum, non quod nescive∣rim à Detractione neminem esse immunem, nisi qui nihil scriberet: sed quòd abundè noverim cùm pro salu∣te Patriae, tùm verò maximè pro patria Salutis, atque adeò pro Fidei synceritate nullum non laborem esse subeundum. Secundò, multos alios multo majore cum profectu munere hoc defungi posse agnosco: veruntamen, quatenùs praestare quicquam valeam, illud S. Augu∣stini aures mihi vellicat, animumque stimulat: Qui mendacium docet, (inquit) & qui veritatem tacet, uterque reus est; alter quià prodesse non vult, alter quia nocere desiderat. Nec profectò hanc Romulei stabuli (cùm purgandi non datur) exagitandi provin∣ciam, in re Missatica, alio animo suscepi, quàm ut
omnes (quibus veritas cordi est) intelligant, Nos An∣glicanae Ecclesiae Alumnos Causam nactos esse Divinis literis consentientem maximè, Catholicae Antiquitatis suffragijs comprobatam, mille omnis ordinis Martyrum sanguine testatam; imò etiam (addendum est enim) cujusvis Christiani, si fieri posset, vel mille mortibus ob∣signandam. Praetereà, Romanae Ecclesiae Tyrunculis omissis, Antesignanos ipsos libentiùs aggredior, du∣plici ratione adductus; quià primò, his profligatis, illi non possunt consistere: deindè, ut clariùs constet, in illam Ecclesiam quadrare illud Christi; Si lumen, quod in te, tenebrae, ipsae tenebrae quantae? Quos tamen, dùm Argumentis persequor, non probris insector; quià in hoc altero Certaminis genere vincere vinci est: nam prae∣clarè olim Artaxerxes Rex militi, hostem convitijs pro∣scindenti, Non ut maledicas te alo, (inquit) sed ut pugnes. Cur verò Vobis potissimùm has meas Lucubrationes dedicarem, plurimae me Causae impulerunt. Antiquitùs plurimi dicebantur Episcopi Catholicae sive Ʋniver∣salis Ecclesiae, non solùm quòd Catholicam tenerent fidem, sed etiam quòd suam pro incolumitate Ecclesiae Ʋniversalis curam Scriptis & laboribus testarentur. E∣gone igitur ut non illud studium ergà utramque Vni∣versitatem profitear meum, quod ipsi (ut ità dicam) Vniversalitati debeam? Huc accedit (nam quidni fi∣dorum Amicorum literis fidem habeam?) quòd cum vos Opus nostrum aliud, tribus abhinc annis publici juris fa∣ctum, non vulgari animorum vestrorum significatione ap∣probâsse intellexerim; hoc{que}, quod nunc ad umbilicum per∣duxi, non minori cum desiderio expectâsse (quorum illud
GRANDEM ROMANAE ECCLESIAE IMPO∣STVRAM detexit, hoc ROMANAE MISSAE IDO∣LOMANIAM, tanquàm immane monstrum, confodicat) non committendum putavi, ut non grati animi meum hoc testimonium Vobis referrem. Quid? quòd Causae ipsius necessitas quo{que} id à me exigere videbatur, quae profectò in hac Causa homines Academicos nihil minùs quàm Academicos & Scepticos esse sinet; nè quis vestrûm (quod detestabile omen Deus obruat!) in Rom. Artolatriam prolabatur, quò vel Aliis scan∣dalo, Majestati divinae odio, Sibi ipsi deni{que} certo exitio esse possit. Postremò, in hanc spem adducor, nunquàm defuturos ex utra{que} Academia viros plurimos, Theologici juris con∣sultiss. omnibus{que} armis instructissimos, non modò ad hu∣jusce Causae patrocinium sustinendum, verumetiam ad Mataeologiam omnem Romanensium expugnandam. Pergite igitur ô macti antiquâ prudentiâ & veritate, pergite, inquam, & Amantissimum vestri diligite; quod rectius noveritis impertite, & precibus vestris adjuvate. In Christo Jesu valete, qui vos conservet in gloriam Gratiae suae! AMEN. THO. DVNELMENS. nuper COVEN. & LICHF.
An Advertisement To all Romish Priests and Jesuites of the English Seminaries, concerning the Necessitie of this ensuing Treatise; as also of the Authors Sinceritie, and his Adversaries unconscionable Dealing in their Allegations of Authors. Grace, Peace, and Truth in CHRIST JESVS. AMong all the Controversies held against your Romish Religion, none were e∣ver more hott, to draw Protestants violently into the fire, than these two; First, the denying your Romane Church to bee The Catholike Church, without which there is no Salvation: Secondly, the affirming the Romish Adoration of the Sacrament of the Altar to be Idolatrous. Therefore have I especially under∣taken the discussion of both these Questions, that seeing (as Saint Augustine truly said) It is not the punishment, but the Cause which maketh a Martyr; it might fully ap∣peare to the world, whether Protestants enduring that fi∣erie tryall, for both Causes, were indeed Heretikes, or true Martyrs: and consequently whether their Persecu∣tors were just Executioners of persons then condemned, and not rather damnable Murtherers of the faithfull Ser∣vants of Christ. And I doubt not, but as the first hath ve∣verified the Title of that Booke, to prove your Doctrine, of the Necessitie of Salvation in your Romish Church, to be a GRAND IMPOSTVRE: So this second, which I now (according to my promise) present unto you, will
make good, by many Demonstrations, that your Romish MASSE is a very Masse, or rather a Gulfe of many Su∣perstitious, Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous Positions and Practises. And because the very name of ROMANE CHVRCH is com∣monly used as (in it selfe) a powerfull enchantment, to stu∣pifie everie Romish Disciple, and to strike him deafe and dumbe at once, that hee may neither heare nor utter any thing in Conference, concerning the Masse, or any other Controversie in Religion; be the Protestants Defence never so Divine for Trueth, or Ancient for Time, or Vniversall for Consent, or Necessarie for Beleefe: I therefore held it requisite, in the first place, to discover the falshood of the former Article of your Church, before I would pub∣lish the Abominations of the Masse; to the end that (for Ilatrie in Scripture is often termed spirituall Adulterie) the Romish Church, which playeth the Bawd, in patroni∣zing Idolatrie, being once outted, your Romish Masse, as the Strumpet, might the more easily either bee reformed, or wholly abandoned. This may satisfie you for the necessitie of this Tra∣ctate. The next must bee to set before you your owne de∣lusorie trickes, in answering, or not answering Bookes written against you; especially such as have beene obser∣ved from mine owne experience. One is, to strangle a Booke in the very birth: So dealt Master Brerely long since, by a Letter writ unto mee, to prevent the publish∣ing of my Answere against the first Edition of his Apolo∣gie, when hee sent mee a second Edition thereof to be answered, which both might and ought to have beene sent a twelve moneth sooner; but was purposely reserved not to bee delivered, untill the very day after mySee the Protestants Appeale in the beginning. An∣swere (called An Appeale) was published. Of which his prevention I have therefore complained, as of a most un∣conscionable Circumvention. Another device you have, to give out that the Booke (whatsoever,) written against your Romish Tenents, is in answering, and that an An∣swere will come out shortly. So dealt Master Parsons
with mee,In his Sober Reckoning. Certifying mee and all his credulous Readers of an Epistle which hee had received from a Scottish Do∣ctor, censuring my Latine Apologies to be both fond and false; and promising that his Answere to them, Printed at Gratz in Austria, should be published before the Mi∣chaelmas next following: whereas there have beene a∣bove twentie Michaelmasses sithence, every one giving Master Parsons his promise the flatt lye. A third Art is a voluntarie Concealement; And thus Master Brerely, who having had knowledge of the fore-mentioned Booke of Appeale, manifesting his manifold Aberrations and Absur∣surdities in doctrine, his ignorances and fraudes in the a∣buse of his Authors; as in other passages throughout that Booke, so more especially the parts concerning the Ro∣mish Masse: yet since hath written a large Booke, in de∣fence of the Romish Liturgie or Masse, urging all the same Proofes and Authorities of Fathers; but wisely concealing that they had beene confuted, and his Falshoods discove∣red. Onely hee and Master Fisher singling out of my Ap∣peale an Explanation, which I gave of the Testimonie of Gelasius (in condemning the Manichees, concerning their opinion of not administring the Eucharist in both kindes) did both of them divulge it in their Bookes and reports also in many parts of this Kingdome, as making for the justification of their sacrilegious dismembring the holy Sa∣crament, and for a foule Contradiction unto my selfe not∣withstanding that this their scurrilous insultation (as is Boke 1. cap. 3. Sect. 7. heere proved) serveth for nothing rather than to make themselves ridiculous. The last, but most base and de∣villish Gullerie, is a false imputation of Falshoods in the alleging of Authors, which was the fine sleight of Ma∣ster Parsons; a man as subtile for Invention, as elegant for Expression, for Observation as dextrous and acute, and as politike and perswasive for Application, as any of his time. Hee in an Answere to some Treatises, written against your Romish blacke Art of Aequivocation by mentall Reser∣vation, and other Positions fomenting Rebellion (to wit) in his Bookes of Mitigation and Sober Rekoning, doeth
commonly leave the principall Objections and reasons, and falleth to his verball skirmishes, concerning false Al∣legations: and (as turning that Ironicall Counsell into earnest, Audacter & fortiter calumniare, &c.) hee chargeth mee with no lesse than fiftie Falsifications All which I spunged out in a Booke entituled an Encounter, and re∣torted all the same Imputations of falshood upon himselfe, with the interest, discovering above forty more of his owne. Which may seeme to verifie that Cognizance, which your owne Brother-hood of Romish Priests in their Quodli∣bets have fastened on his sleeve, calling him The Quintessence of Coggerie. As for mine owne Integritie, I have that which may justifie mee; for howsoever any one or other Error may happen, in mis-alleging any one Authour, yet that I have not erred much; or if at all, yet never against my Conscience. Heereof I have many Witnesses; One with∣in mee, a witnesse most Domesticall, yet least partiall, and as good as Thousands, mine owne Conscience: a se∣cond is above mee, GOD, who is Greater than the Con∣science. A third sort of Witnesses are such as stand by mee, even all they who have beene conversant with mee, in the Perusall and Examination of Authours Testimo∣nies, by mee alleged; men of singular Learning and Iudgement, who can testifie how much they endeared them-selves unto mee, when any of them happened to shew mee the least errour in any thing. (Hee that shall say, Non possum errare, must be no man; and hee that will not say, Nolo errare, as hating to erre, can be no Christian man.) The last Witnesse, for my integritie, may bee the Bookes of my greatest Adversaries, Master Parsons, and Master Brerely, whose many scores of Falshoods have beene layd so open and published for a∣bove sixteene yeares past in two Bookes (one called An Encounter against the Foreman, the other an Appeale a∣gainst the Second) yet hath not any one appeared out of your Romish Seminaries, for the vindicating of them heerein.
{fleur-de-lys}Since this Part of this Advertisement thus given, there have some of your Engineers sought to undermine the whole Structure of this Treatise, by the odious Im∣putation of Falsification; One was a L: Baron, and his Suggestor: Another, a notable Seducer, in his Letters to a noble Peere of this Kingdome: the Third, a Romish∣ly inspired Detractor, who are, in this Second Edition, defeated by a Countermine of just Vindications, against their False and frivolous Exceptions. To say nothing of a late Hobgoblin his feigned Letter to a Ladie, upbrai∣ding mee with such Taxations of some Falsities, which about six and twentie yeares since, were falsly charged upon mee by Master Parsons, as I proved in a Booke of Encounter. By which your Practice is confirmed that which I have often averred, That none may expect from you any Satisfactorie Confutation of this, or the like Treatises, seeing that instead of Shott, you answere only with Squibs. Goe on in the same Course, to make mee thereby a true Prophet, and (by my Vindications against your Calumniations) to occasion greater Advantage to our Cause, and just Defence thereof.{fleur-de-lys} By these Advertisements you may now easily conceive with what confidence I may procede in this Worke, wherein is displayed and layd open, in the discussing of these Eight Words of Christ his Institution of the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist, [HEE BLESSED; BRAKE; GAVE; TO THEM; SAYING; TAKE; EATE; DRINKE,] your ten Romish Prevarications, and Trans∣gressions. Afterwards, in the following Bookes, are re∣veiled the stupendious Paradoxes, Sacrilegiousnesse, and Idolatrie of your MASSE; together with the notorious Obstinacies, some few Overtures of Perjuries (out of that great Summe, which may afterwards be manifested in your swearing to the other Articles of your new Romane Faith) and the manifold Heresies in the Defenders thereof: as also their indirect and sinister Objecting and Answering of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers throughout, as if they con∣tended neither from Conscience, nor for Conscience-sake.
To Conclude. Whosoever among you hath beene fasci∣nated (according to your Colliers Catechisme) with that one∣ly Article of an Implicite Faith, let him be admonished to submit to that Duetie prescribed by the Spirit of God, to Trie all things, and to Hold that which is good. And if any have a purpose to Rejoyne, in Confutation either of the Booke of the Romish Imposture, or of this, which is against your Masse; I do adjure him in the name of Christ, whose truth wee seeke, that avoyding all deceitfull Collusions, hee pro∣cede materially fromSed surdis canimus. poynt to poynt, and labour such an Answer, which hee beleeveth hee may answere for before the Iudgement seat of Christ. Our Lord Iesus preserve us to the glory of his saving Grace. AMEN. THO.

Doctors would have the word, MASSE, first to bee (in the first and primitive Imposition and use thereof) Divine. Secondly, in Time, more ancient than Christ. Thirdly, in Signification, most Religious, derived (as They say) from the Hebrew word Missah, which signifieth Oblation and Sacrifice; even the highest Homage that can bee performed unto God.
And all this, to prove (if it may bee) that, which you call, THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASSE. CHALLENGE. SO have these your Doctors taught, notwithstanding many o∣ther Romanists, as well Iesuites as others of principall Note in your Church, enquiring (as it were) after the native Coun∣trey, kinred, and age of the Word, MASSE, doe not only say, but also proove, first, that It is no Hebrew-borne. Secondly, that it is not of Primitive Antiquitie, because not read of before the dayes of Saint Ambrose, who lived about three hundred se∣ventie three yeares after Christ. Thirdly, that it is a plaine Latine word, to wit, Masse, signifying the Dismission of the Con∣gregation.

Gordonus Scotus lib. Controvers. Controv. 9. cap. 6.

That the word, MASSE, in the Primitive Signification thereof, doth properly belong unto the Protestants: and justly condemneth the Romish manner of Masse. SECT. II.

This point of mixture of water with wine was not commanded of Christ: but afterwards enjoyned by the Church. This being (as Iesuites and others doe witnesse) a Doctrine generally consented unto by your Schoolmen, and they them∣selves giving their Amen thereunto; as also alleaging, for their owne better confirmation herein, the judgement of two late Romish Councils, Florence and Trent; besides their dint of Reasons; wherof one was the ground of my Assertion (to wit) Because if it had been commanded by Christ, or ordained by necessity of a Precept of Christ, it should be likewise of the necessi∣ty, or Essence of the Sacrament; which Necessitie the Church of Rome universally excludeth. The Consequence therfore is evident; for whatsoever was instituted, as the matter of a Sacrament, was ever held to bee of the necessitie of the Es∣sence of the same Sacrament. Wherefore wee may reckon this Mixture amongst those Circumstances of Christs Actions, which were Occasionall, by reason of the use and Custome of that Countrey of Iudaea at that time, for the tempering and al∣laying of their Wine with Water.Iac.

The Poynts contained within the Canon of Christ his Masse, and appertaining to our present Controversie, are of two kindes, viz. 1. Practicall. 2. Doctrinall. SECT. V. PRacticall or Active is that part of the Canon, which concer∣neth Administration, Participation, and Receiving of the holy Sacrament, according to this Tenour, Matth. 2.

Likewise also after Supper he tooke the Cup, and gave thankes, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of this.] But the Points, which are especially to be called Doctrinall, are im∣plied in these words of the Evangelists; [THIS IS MY BODY: And, THIS IS MY BLOOD of the new Testament, which is shed for you, and for many for remission of sinnes] We be∣gin with the Practicall.

Neverthe∣lesse, because there is in yours the substance of Bread, therefore we will not contend about Accidents and shadowes; but we in∣sist upon the words of Christ his Institution. The first Transgression of the (now) Church of Rome, in contradicting Christ his Canon, is collected out of these words, [AND HE BLESSED IT;] which concerne the Couse∣cration of this Sacrament. SECT.

our Saviour, was performed by that his Blessing by Prayer, which preceded the pronouncing of those words, [HOC EST CORPVS MEVM:] [This is my Body, &c.] To this purpose hec is bold to averre that Thomas Aquinas, and all Ca∣tholike; before Cajetane have confessed that Christ did consecrate in that his [BENEDIXIT, that is, Heh essed it.] And that Saint Iames and Dionyse the Areopagit did not Consecrate onely in the other words, but by Prayer. Then he assureth us that the Greeke Churches maintained, that Consecration consisteth in Benediction, by Prayer, and not in the onely repetition of the words aforesaid. After this hee produceth your subtilest Schooleman Scotus, accompanied with divers others, who Derided those, that attributed such a su∣pernaturall virtue to the other forme of words. After steppeth in your Lindan, who avoucheth Iustin (one of the ancientest of Fathers) as Denying that the Apostles consecrated the Eucha∣rist in those words, [HOC EST, &c.] and affirming that Con∣secration could not be without Prayer. Be you but pleased to peruse the Marginals, and you shall fur∣ther find alleadged the Testimonies of Pope Gregory, Hierome, Ambrose, Bernard, and (to ascend higher) The Liturgies of Cle∣ment, Basil, Chrysostome, and of the Romane Church it selfe; in gain-saying of the Consecration, by the onely words of Institution, as you pretend.

It were to be wished, that when you frame your Answeres, to direct other mens Consciences, you would first satisfie your owne, especially being occupied in soules-businesses. Wee conclude. Seing that Forme (as all learning teacheth) giveth Being unto all things; therefore your Church, albeit shee use Prayer, yet erring in her judgement concerning the perfect manner and Forme of Consecration of this Sacrament, how shall shee be credited in the materialls? wherein shee will bee found, aswell as in this, to have Transgressed the same Injunction of Christ, [DO THIS.] Neverthelesse, this our Conclusion is not so to be interpre∣ted, as (hearkenIt was Mr Brereley his error, Liturg. p. 101. in alleaging Irenaeus lib. 5. c. 1.

Then he proceedeth to the Repetition of the whole institution, as the complement of Consecration, in the words [Take, eat, This is my body:] but not only in these words, [This is my body.] We see then that the Latine Church had this forme (Fac) even as the Greeke had their : both in Prayer, but neither of both without reciting the forme of Institution.] Mr. Brerely) to exclude, out of the words of this Celebration, the Repetition and pronuntiation of these words [This is my Body: and, This is my Bloud of the new Testa∣ment.] Farre be this from us, because wee hold them to bee es∣sentially belonging to the Narration of the Institution of
Christ; and are used in the Liturgie of our Church: for al∣though they bee not words of Blessing and Consecration, (be∣cause not of Petition, but of Repetition) yet are they Words of Direction; and, withall, Significations and Testifications of the mysticall effects thereof. {fleur-de-lys}A Vindication, against the (possible) adverse Conceipts of Some. For a further manifestation, hearken you unto that which is written;1. Tim. 4. 4. Every Creature of God is good, if it be sanctified with the word of God, and with Prayer. Wherein wee finde a double acception of Sanctification; the one of Ordination, by The word of God: the other of Benediction, namely, by Prayer. For example, The eating of Swines flesh is sancti∣fied to the use of a Christian, first by Ordination, because the word of God in the new Testament hath taught us the lawfull use of Swines flesh: and secondly by Benediction by Prayer, or giving of thanks, in which respect it is, that the Apostle calleth the one part the Cup of Blessin. 1 Cor. 10. 16. Both of these are to be found in our Sacramentall food, wherein wee have the Sanctification thereof, both by the Word of Christ in the tenour of his first Institution, Hee tooke bread, &c. adding [Do this:] as also by publike bles∣sing in Prayer, which is more properly called Consecration. And although in our Domestical feasts, the second Course is blessed in the grace, which was said upon the first service; so the second supply of Bread and Wine (if it shall inordi∣nately so happen) may not altogether be denied to be con∣secrated by the blessing pronounced upon the first: (even as the Sanctifying of the Sheafe of Corn, was the hallowing of the whole field.) Notwithstanding, our Church hath caute∣lously ordained, that the words of Institution [He tooke bread, &c.] be applyed to every oblation of new Bread and Wine, for accommodation-sake, as they are referred in our Litur∣gie; wherein they are necessarily joyned together with the words of Prayer and Benediction. Therefore, where you shall finde in the Fathers the words of Christ's Institution, called Consecration;{fleur-de-lys}Chrys.

Secondly, that this Act of Breaking of bread is such a principall Act, that the whole Celebration of this Sacrament hath had from thence this Appellation given to it, by the Apo∣stles, to be called Breaking of Bread. Thirdly, that the Church of Christ alwayes observed the same Ceremonie of Breaking the bread, aswell in the Greeke as in the Latine (and consequently the Romane) Church. Fourthly, that this Breaking of the Bread is a Symbolicall Ceremonie, betokening not only the Crucifying of Christs bodie upon the Crosse, but also (in the common participa∣tion thereof) representing the Vnion of the Mysticall body of Christ, which is his Church, Communicating together of one loafe: that as many graines in one loafe, so all faithfull Communicants are united to one Head Christ, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 10. thus, [The bread which wee breake, is it not the Communion of the bodie of Christ? for we being many are one bread.] Wee adde, as a most speciall Reason, that this Breaking it, in the distribution thereof, is to apply the representation of the Bo∣die Crucified, and the Bloud shed to the heart and soule of every Communicant: That as the Bread is given Broken to us, so was Christ Crucified for us. Yet, neverthelesse, your Church contra∣rily professing, that although Christ did breake bread, yet (BE∣HOLD!) she doth not so; what is it else, but to starch her face, and insolently to confront Christ his Command, by her bold Coun∣termand (as you now see) in effect saying; But doe not this. A SECOND CHALLENGE. AS for that truly-called Catholike Church, you your selves do grant unto us, that by Christ his first Institution, by the Practice of the Apostles, by the ancient and universall Custome of the whole Church of Christ, aswell Greeke as Latine, the Cere∣mony of Breaking bread was continually observed. Which may bee unto us more than a probable Argument, that the now Church of Rome doth falsly usurpe the Title of CATHO∣LIKE, for the better countenancing and authorizing of her novell, Customes, although never so repugnant to the will of Christ and Custome of the truly-called Catholike Church. Howbeit wee would not bee so understood, as to thinke it an Essentiall Ceremonie either to the being of a Sacrament, or to the Sacramentall Administration; but yet requisite, for the Commandement and Example-sake. In the next place, to your Pretence of Not-breaking, because of Reverence, Wee say; Hem, scilicet, Quanti est sapere! As if Christ and his Apostles could not fore-see that your Necessitie, (namely) that by the Distributing of the Bread, and by Breaking it, some little crummes must cleave sometimes unto the beards of the Communicants, or else fall to the ground. Or as though
this Alteration were to be called Reverence, and not rather Ar∣rogance, in making your-selves more wise than Christ, who insti∣tuted; or than all the Apostles, or Fathers of primitive times, who continued the same Breaking of Bread. Therefore this your Contempt of Breaking, what is it but a peremptory breach of Christ his Institution, never regarding what the Scripture saith;1 Sam. 15. 22. Obedience is better then Sacrifice.

WEe make bold yet againe to condemne your Custome of Private Masse, and consequently the Commendation
given thereof by the Councel of Trent. For by the Canon of your Masse, wherein there are interlocutorie speeches between Priest and People, at the celebration of this Sacrament, the Priest saying [Dominus vobiscum: The Lord be with you;] and the People answering the Priest, and saying [And with thy Spirit] your Claudius Espencaeus, sometimes a Parisian Doctour (one commended byClaudij Espen∣cae Theologi Parisi∣ensis Tractatus de utra{que} Mssa: qa∣rum alteram publi∣cam, alteram priva∣tam appellant.

Answers, which I re∣ferre to your Choice; whether you will believe, with Gratian, that the words [Dominus vobiscum: The Lord be with you] spo∣ken by the Priest, being alone, may be thought to have been spo∣ken to Angels: or, with ameracensis, unto Stones: or, with the Heremites in their Celles, unto Formes and Stooles: or else, with the Deane of the Cardinals, teaching any Heremite being alone, to say, [The Lord be with you] as spoken to himselfe. All which imaginarie fooleries are so unworthy the Conceptions of but reasonable men, that wee may feare to be held inconsiderate, If wee should indeavour to confute them. Onely wee can say no lesse, than that if the Apostle did condemne them, who

If (saith hee) there be none to interpret, and there come in an Ignorant or Infidell observing this, will hee not say, you are mad? how much more extreame Madnesse must wee judge this to be, where men either talke to themselves, or else (as if they were metamorphosed into the things, whereunto they speake) unto formes, stones, stooles, and the like? For Conclusion, heare the said Deane of the Romane Cardi∣nals (from whom aSacerdos dicit [Pax omnibus vo∣bis:] quoniam autem pro se-invicem precari est praeceptum Apo∣stolicum, propterea populus quo{que} ei ip∣sam pacem precatur, dicens, [Et cùm spi∣ritu tuo.] Nic.

Wee say, with him, to unite them, not (as you do) to separate People from Priest by your solitary Masses; and yet to confound their speech by your [Dominus vo∣biscum.] And if this may not prevaile with you, yet me-thinks the authoritie of Pope Gregorie, sirnamed the Great, might com∣mand your beliefe.

AnOne that of late writ to a Popish Lady, not discovering his name. Anonymus, not long since, would needs perswade his Reader, that by [Vobiscum] was meant the Clerke of the Pa∣rish. But why was it then not said, Dominus tecum, The Lord be with thee? O, this forsooth, was spoken to the Clerke in ci∣vility, according to the ordinary Custome of entitling singular persons in the plurall number: and this Answer hee called Sal∣ving of a Doubt. But any may reply, that if it were good manners in the Priest, to call upon the Clerke with [Vobiscum] in the plurall number, for civilitie sake, it must then be rusticitie in you Church, to teach your Clerke to answer your Priest [Et cum Spiritu tuo: And with thy Spirit.] And againe, the answer is impertinent, for where the Priest is found thus parling with the Clerke, hee cannot be said to be Alone. And so the answer of this man must be indeed not Salving, but (as the rest of his man∣ner of answering) a Quack-salving rather, and a meere Delu∣sion. {fleur-de-lys}Which also the end of the first Institution of these words [The Lord be with you] doth furthermore declare, which was (as isMicrolog.

A THIRD CHALLENGE. Against the same Custome. A Custome Commendable, say your Fathers of Trent; Con∣demnable, say wee, even from your owne Consciences, because you were never hitherto able to produce either any Commendable, yea or Tollerable example, expresly recorded within the many Volumes of Antiquitie, of any celebration of the Eucharist, without a Communion; no, not in that onely ob∣jected place ofChrysost. in E∣phes. Hom 3. Frustr habetur quotidiana oblatio, frustrà sta∣mus ad altare, cùm nemo est qui partici∣pet. Ob. à Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap 9. [Not that in these daily Celebrations None at all did com∣municate with the Priest: for hee was accompanied, at least, with some Ecclesia-stickes, as is implyed in the words, (Stamus ad Altare) And it is no rare Hyperbale in Chrysostome to use the word, , for, a Paucitie.] Chrysostome, whose Speech is not a Grant, that absolutely All were absent from his administration of the Eucharist: but certainly it is a vehement Invective against all wilfull Absents. So farre was hee from allowing, much more from Commending Communicating alone, who else-where, a∣gainst such as neglected to Communicate with the poore, ta∣king his Argument from the example of Christ, That Sup∣per (Chrysost.

The very Argument of Saint Hierome, saying (yet more obligatorily)Hieron. Coena Domini dicitur, quia Dominus in coena tradidit Sacramenta. Dominica coena debet om∣nibus esse communis.

And as touching [For againe, if it should be strictly racked, so should he himselfe not have participated, and then was it no Masse at all. But Chrysostome's Rhecorique, in hyperbolizing, is noted esp∣cially by your Senensis; as may be observed in Chrysostome's like Invective against the carnall security of men, even in the word, Nemo: Nemo divina sapit: nemo terrena contemnit: nemo ad coelum attendit. Hom. 12. ad Heb. Now, none is so senselesse as to thinke hereby that Chrysostome thought himselfe absolutely to bee wholly alone.] [Nemo, No man] in the testimony of Chrysostome, it is knowne to be taken restrainedly, for Few: and so[Frustrà stamus, &c.] Ex quibus verbis apparet, in his quotidianis Missis folos ferè Ministros & Cleri∣cos, paucos verò aut nullos à populis communicâsse.

It is decreed (saith he) that because it is said by the Priest in the plurall number [The Lord be with you] and also [pray for mee] that none presume to celebrate without two, besides the Priest, to make answere to these Salutations.

IN the aforesaid Canon of Christ his Masse it followeth, [And he said unto Them. ] Christ Saying, or speaking to his Disciples, by commanding them to Take, &c. did, doubtlesse, so speake, that they might heare his Command; to wit, in an audible voice.

Thirdly, that the same Innovation was much misliked by the Emperour Iustinian, who
severely commanded by his Edict (asNovellà Con∣stit. 123.

Et in Liturgijs Graecis Basilij & Chrysostomi praescribunt quaedam sub silentio dicenda.—In Liturgijs Chrysostomi Sacerdos orat , quod non significat moderatâ vocae, sed planè secretò. In Lati∣nis Liturgijs, Innocentio teste, praecipua pars Missae secreta erat. Bellar quo supra. [We oppose. 1.

Neither doth Chrysostome's  nor Innocentius his Secretò inferre any more than such a Service, in respect of them that were not to be partakers of the Communion.

Whereas the Catholike Church, notwithstanding, for many hun∣dred yeares together, precisely observed the ordinance of Christ. THE SECOND CHALLENGE. In respect of the necessitie of a Lowd voice, especially by the Romish Priest, in uttering the words of Consecration. THe greatest silence, which is used by the Romane worship∣pers, is still in the Priests uttering, or rather muttering the words of Institution [HOC EST CORPVS MEVM: and, Hic est sanguis meus:] albeit heere is the greatest and most necessa∣rie Cause of expressing them, for the satisfaction of everie understanding Hearer among you. For, those, you call the words of Consecration, the just pronuntiation whereof you hold to be most necessary: because if the Priest, in uttering of them, faile but in one syllable, so farre as to alter the sense of Christs words (which as you say may happen by six manner of De∣fects) then the whole Consecration is void; and the thing which you adore, is in substance meerelySee Booke 7 c. 5. §. 2. Bread still. If therefore the
People shall stand perplexed in themselves, whether the words, which are concealed, be duly uttered by the Priest to himselfe, how shall it not concerne them to heare the same expresly pro∣nounced, lest that (according to your owne Doctrine) they be de∣luded in a point of faith, and with divine worship adore Bread instead of the person of the Sonne of God? Whereof we are to entreat at large in dueIbidem. place, if God permit. Your fift Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Masse, is a second ontradiction against the Sense of the former words of Christ [—SAID VNTO THEM] SECT. VII. AGaine, that former Clause of the Canon of Christ, to wit [He said unto them] teacheth that as his voyce, Saying unto them, was necessarily audible, to reach their eares; so was it also Intelligible, to instruct their understanding: and therefore not uttered in a Tongue unknowne. Which is evident by that he giveth a Reason for the taking of the Cup [Enim] For this is the bloud, &c. which particle [For] (saith your[ENIM.] Ea particula intelligitur in forma panis Bel∣lar. l. 4. de Euch. c. 14 Cardinall) is imply∣ed in the first part also.

So you. And this is as much as wee need to require, concerning the judge∣ment and practice of the true Antiquitie of this Custome. You will rather doubt (wee suppose) of the Vniversalitie thereof, because you usually goe no farther then your Dictates, which teach, that because there were generally but three generall and knowne tongues, Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, therefore the di∣vine Service was celebrated thorowout the Church in one of these three. And because these could not be the vulgar lan∣guage of every Christian Nation, it must follow (sayBellar. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 15 & 16. and so Others also. they) that the People of most Nations understood not the publike Prayers used in their severall Churches. And with this perswasion doe your Doctors locke up your consciences in a false beliefe of an universall Custome of an unknowne service of God. Which you may as easily unlocke againe, if you shall but use, as a key, this one Observation, viz. That the three common tongues (namely) Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, although they were not al∣wayes the vulgar Languages, yet were they knowne Languages com∣monly to those people that used them in Divine Service. Which one onely Animadversion will fully demonstrate unto us the truth of our Cause. It is not denied but that the three Languages, Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine were, in primitive ages, mostTres hae hunguae universalissimae, ità ut Hebraica per to∣tum fee Orientem: Omnes enim Chl∣dcâ, aut Syriacâ 1.

The Greeke was currant thorow the whole Greeke Church also, and in the lesser Asia. And the La∣tine was dispersed over a great part of Europe. It will now be ful∣lie sufficient to know, that the most of these Languages were certainly knowne, in publicke worship, unto all them of whom they were used in publicke Sermons, and preachings. For your owne Church, howsoever shee decreed of Praying, yet doth she forbid Preaching in an unknowne tongue. Now therefore joyne (wee beseech you) the eyes of your bodies and minde together, in beholding and pondering our Marginals, and you shall finde, first (if wee speake of the

Not to tell you of the now-Custome of the remote Christian Churches, such as are the Egyptians, Russians, Ethiopians, Arme∣nians, and others; all which exercise their publike Service in the vulgar and mother-tongues of their owne so distinct and dif∣ferent Nations. For the which cause they can finde no better entertainment with your Iesuites, than to admonish you that Certum est (inquiunt Protestantes) Ruthenos, AEgyptios, AEthiopes, Armenos, & quosdm alios celerbare divina Officia in Lingua vulgari.—Respondemus, nos non moveri Barbaro∣rum moribus, Salomeron, Ies.

Cor. 14. 11. Barbarousnesse it selfe. With the same modestie might you scoffe at, and reproach o∣ther more ancient Nations and Christians, commended by primitive Fathers, for celebrating their Oblations, Prayers, and Psalmes in their Nationall tongues; so, that one repeating the words first, the whole people with joynt voyce and heart accor∣ded in singing. Among whom are recorded the converted

This from the Testimonies of holy Fathers. Whether therefore the tongue, wee pray in, bee barbarous or learned, it is not respected of God, but whether it be knowne or unknowne, is the point. In which respect we may usurpe the Similitude which S. Augustine hath; What availeth a golden Key, if it cannot open that which should bee opened? or what hurteth a wooden Key;Orig. con.

By this time you see your Noveltie in your Romish Practice. Behold in the next place the Iniquitie and prophannesse thereof, and how after the death of Pope Gregorie the first, which was about 608 years after Christ, your Roman Church degenerated as much from the (then) Romane truth,Bas. ad Cler.

A SECOND CHALLENGE, Shewing the Iniquitie of Service in an Vnknowne tongue: and first of the Injury done by the foresaid Romane Decree unto the soules of Men. THe former Decree of your Councell for unknowne Service, how injurious it is unto man, we may learne by the Confes∣sions, of Iesuites and others,Apostolus praeci∣pit, ut Preces ad aedi∣ficationem fiant, quemadmodùm pro∣batur Rom. 15.—Plus lucratur, quoad intellectum et affe∣ctum, qui non igno∣rat quae orat.—Qui non intelligit, non ae∣dificatur, in quantum non intelligit in speciali, licet in generali intelligat.—Ad fructum devotionis conducibilius intelligendo orare.

[which he confesseth of the Apostles times.] granting that The Apostles in their times required a knowne Language, Greeke in the Greeke Churches, and Latine in the Latine Churches: because first that this made for the Edidification and consolation of Christians. Secondly, that Mangaineth more both in mind and affection, who knoweth
what he prayeth. As for him that is Ignorant, you say, He is not edified, inasmuch as he knoweth not in particular, although in ge∣nerall he doth understand. Thirdly, that the Apostle commandeth that all things be done to edification. Fourthly, that the knowne Service is sitter for Devotion: and thereupon some of you have furthermore Concluded, that It were better that the Service were used in a Language knowne both to the Clergie and People. And a∣gaine, that People profit no whit by praying in a strange language. So your owne Writers, as you may observe in the Marginals. Now what more extreame and intolerable Injury could you do to the soules of Gods people, than by imposing a strange lan∣guage upon them, thereby (according to your own Confessions) to deprive them, and that wittingly, of Edification, Consolation, and Devotion, the three chiefe Benefits that mans soule is ca∣pable off, in the service of God? Thus in respect of your Inju∣rie against Man. A THIRD CHALLENGE. Touching the Injurie done, by the same Decree, a∣gainst God himselfe. YEt all this notwithstanding, you are bent to cozen Christian people with palpable Sophistry, by yourBellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 16.

Cardinall, who confesseth that the Psalmes in the daies of the Primitive Church, were sung joyntly of the people, Because they were ordained for instruction and consolation of the people, as the chiefe end. But as for the Divine Service, The Principall end of it (saith hee) is not the instruction and consolation of the people, but the worship of God. So he. Whom when wee aske, why the people then did all joyne together both in Singing of Psalmes, and Answering the Minister in Divine Service, and Prayer? He saith it was because of the Paucitie, of the people, and rarenesse of the Assembly. Whereby it seemeth hee meant to maintaine Your Degenerate Romish Worship with Paradoxes. First, As if Psalmes, publike∣ly sung in the Church to Gods glory, were not Divine duties and Service. Secondly, As if the Primitive Church, using both Psalmes and other Prayers in a knowne tongue (as hee confesseth) did not hold a necessitie of the common knowledge of both, for Instruction and Consolation. Thirdly, As if the Assemblies of Christians were of such a Paucitie, in the dayes of Tertullian; when those Psalmes ordained for Instruction and Consolation were in use. And fourthly, as if People now adayes had not as much need of Instruction and Consolation, as they that lived in
Primitive times; yea, and more, especially such People, who be∣ing led blind-fold by an Implicite Faith, have reason to crave Instruction; and having their Consciences tortured and perple∣xed with multiplicities of Ceremoniall Lawes, have as just cause also to desire Consolation. As for your objecting the Worship of God by unknowne prayers, that may be sufficient, which your owne Catechisme (authori∣zed by the Councel of Trent) teacheth you; where answering to that question, why God, although he know our wants before we pray, yet will be sollicited by our prayers? itCur Deus, cùm sciat quibus indige∣mus, vult oratio∣ne nostrâ sollicitari? Vult ns è pe tendo petere fidentiùs.—ut magis ad amorem incendantur—ac at saepiùs majori af∣fecti laetitiâ ad cum amandum atque co∣lendum incitemu ar∣dentiùs. Catech. Tid. vel Rom. part. 4. c. 2. pug. 386. saith, that he doth this to the end, that Praying more confidently, we may bee more in∣flamed with love towards God: and so being possessed with more joy, may be exercised to a fervent worship of God. So your publike and generall Romane Catechisme. The case then is plaine. From more Edification there ariseth more Consolation; from more Consolation there issueth more Devotion; from all these proceeds more siliall Love and dutifull Worship of God. Which was long since shadowed (asExod. 15. [Cante∣mus Domino] Can∣tabat Moses & Mi∣riam, hempè Moses, d est, pars intelle∣ctus, & Miraiam, id est sensus purificatus: justum enim est in∣telligibiliter & sensi∣biliter Deo hymno dici, utrumque in∣strumentum concin∣nè pulsari, tàm in∣tellectum, quàm sen∣sum, in solus Dei sal∣vatoris laudem, & actionem Gratiarum.

Therefore, if you be men of Conscience, recant that your now objected Barbarous Paradoxe, Which (contrary to all anciently professed Divinity, and expresse Scripture, saying,1 Cor. 14. 15. I will pray with my spirit, I will pray with my understanding also) doth thrust mans Vnderstanding out of Gods worship, to the utter a∣bolishing of , that is, his Reasonable worshipping of God; by making man (as SaintAugust. Expos. 2. in Psal. 18. Merulae, Psittaci, Corvi, Picae, & hujusmodi volucres saepè docentur ab hominibus sonare quod nesciunt: scenter verò catare non avi, sed homini Divinâ voluntate concessum est. Augustine noteth) no better than Ouzells, Parrots, Ravens, and Mag-pies, all which learne to prate they know not what. THE FOVRTH CHALLENGE, Against the said Romish Decree, as joyntly injurious both to God and Man; from the Text of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 14. IN the fourth place Wee are to speake of the Iniquity of your unknowne language in Prayer, joyntly against both God and Man; because that without the understanding of the Prayer it is impossible for a man (being of discretion) to pray unto, or to praise God as hee ought: and consequently to obtaine any
blessing by prayer from God, according to that Apostolicall Doctrine,  Cor. 14. where hee saith of the man ignorant of the language of prayer, [;] How shall hee say Amen, at thy giving of thankes, seeing hee knoweth not what thou sayest? To which Argument of the Apostles, taken from the Impossibility, your Dicit Apostolus [ut instruam] Expen∣de vocem hanc, In∣struam, quòd sit de praedicatione, non de Missae celebratione.

May it not be said of this your great Doctor, and Antagonist to Luther, that this man could not see the River for water? for (as yourImò sequitur [] quibus verbis Apo¦stolus significat pre∣cari, &c.

Verùm etiam saepenu∣merò nec ipsi Presbyteri nec Diaconi intelligunt quid orant.

Sic in Monasterijs professae, & Monachi non pauci orant, quae intellectu non modò non assequuntur. Sic enim Pueri orant, & est beneplacitum Deo. Eckius Tom. 2. Hom. 3. in festo Rogat. pag. 90. Etiam pueri orant, Ozanna, & preces eo∣rum crant Christo gratissimae Salmer. les. in 1. Cor. 16. Disp. 30. §. Septimo. So the Rhemists in Matth. 21. vers. 16. and in 1. Cor. 19. pag. 463. do your Iesuit Salmeron, Eckius, and the Rhemists) the ex∣ample of Children, because the Children crying Hosanna, and not understanding their prayers, were notwithstanding (say they) accep∣ted of Christ. Ergò the Priest, Monkes, & Nunnes, in praysing God, may be grateful to God although they understand not that which they pray. So they. An Objection taken (as you see) from Children, or rather, as it might seeme, made by Children, it is altogether so Childish. For the Apostle, as it were, foreseeing that this might possibly bee fancied by some fond and obstinate Opposers to the Spirit of Truth, doth in the very same Chapter 1 Cor. 14. 20. purposely prevent it, saying, Brethren, be not children in un∣derstanding. For although, when a Childe asketh his Fathers
blessing onely with clapping his hands together, or uttering halfe syllables, it joyeth the Father, because his Childe now expresseth his duty, according to the Capacitie of a Childe: yet if the same Childe, after hee is come to the perfect yeares of discretion, should performe that duty in no better manner than by Childith babling, would the Father hold this to be Re∣verence, and not rather plaine Mockerie? So is the Case be∣twixt us and God, who2. Cor. 3. 1. accepteth every one according to that which hee hath, and not according to that which hee hath not: a Childe in the capacitie of a Childe, but a man according to the apprehension of a man. In which consideration the Apostle saith, 1 Cor. 13. 11. When I was a childe, I spake as a childe, but being a man, I put away childishnesse. Away therefore with this your more than Childish Objection. Wee returne to the Impossibilitie of praying duely in an un∣knowne tongue, which the Apostle illustrateth by two Simi∣litudes, the one taken from an Instrument of peace, Vers. 7. Hee that knoweth not the distinct sound of the Pipe [] How shall he know what is piped? that is, it is impossible for him to apply him∣selfe to the daunce. The other from an Instrument of warre, Vers. 8. If the Trumpet give an uncertaine sound, who shall pre∣pare himselfe to battell? As if hee would have said, It is impos∣sible to know when to march forward, or when to retraite. So it is said of unknowne Prayer [;] How shall hee that is igno∣rant of the language say Amen? that is to say, (by the inter∣pretation of yourPopulus igno∣tae linguae quomodò respondebit, Amen? hoc est, animae prae∣hebit assensum, cùm more Babylonice cō∣susionis qui dissident, nequaquam sensu a∣ninusque conspirent. Acosta Ies. de Indo∣rum salute, cap. 6. pag. 37. Iesuit) How shall people, ignorant of the tongue, answer Amen? (that is) yield consent unto the Prayer, seeing that they who dissent among themselves after a Babylonish confusion, cannot consent in minde and affection. So he. Or, as yourQuomodò di∣cet, [Amen?] Cùm quid boni dicas non intelligit, nisi bene∣dicas tantùm. Aqui∣nas in hunc locum, 1. Corinth. 14. I adde Sander. de visib. Mo∣narch. ad An. 1563.

[Thus from the Apostle hee granteth, that Prayers are not to bee used, where the people have not the intepretation: although hee say, that Deus honorificentiùs colitur per lin∣guam doctam, quàm per indoctam & vulgarem. As though where there is no respect of persons with God, yet there should be respect of the Tongues.] A∣quinas; How shall hee say, Amen, who understandeth not what good words thou speakest, but onely knoweth that thou blessest? Thus in one Transgression you commit a double Sacriledge, to wit, by Robbing God of his due Honour, and Men of their spirituall gra∣ces and Comforts. To conclude. These Premises do prove, that among many thousands of your people, assembled at a Romane Masse, and be∣ing ignorant of their Service, not any such an one (a miserable Case!) can justly be held to bee a true Worshipper of God, who requireth of his Worshippers the* Calves of their lippes, and not (as now they make themselves) the lips of Calves.
THE FIFT GHALLENGE, Out of the Doctrine of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 14. more copiously, in confutation of your divers Objections. IT were an easie matter to bee superfluous in the prosecuting of this Argument, by proving the truth of this Doctrine out of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers, if it were imaginable that any Reply could bee made to that which is already sayd. But yet behold anIn his aforemen∣tioned Writing to a Lady, &c. Anonymus, having had notice of most of these points, hath formed such Objections and Answers, as his pre∣judicated and pourblinde Conceit could reach unto. First, and most common, in answere to the places objected out of 1. Cor. 14. affirming (out of the Rhemists Annotations) That the Apostle speaks not of the publike and set prayers of the Church; but of extra∣ordinary & spirituall exercises of Exhortations and suddaine Pray∣ers. So he. Wherein the man contradicteth your ownAlij dicunt Apo∣stolum loqui de di∣vinis officijs, viz. Haymo, Primasius, P. Lombardus, D. Thomas, & alij qui∣dam ex Latinis. Teste Bellar. Lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 16. Schoole∣men, but especially the Apostle his direct saying. Verse 23. If the whole Congregation meete together, &c. What more publique that the Assembly of the whole Congregation? And (to suppose that they were extraordinarie Prayers) what is more Consecta∣rie and Consequent, than that if the Apostle note if for an A∣buse, to practise such Extraordinarie Exercises of Preaching and Praying in a tongue unknowne, even because the Hearers are not thereby Edified? Doubtlesse the same Abuse, practised in pub∣like and ordinarie Service, being more notorious and Common, must needs bee so much the more condemnable: as witnesse bothSee the sixt Chal∣lenge following. Ancient Fathers, and your owneSee the former Challenges. Brethren, who have taught the use of a knowne Tongue, in all publique and ordinary service of God, from this Text of Scripture, which (as you say) speaketh of Prayers extraordinarie. Which is a full Confutation of your former Objection. Yea, but It is sufficient (saith he) that the vulgar people know, in generall, although they understand not the Prayers in particular. Which againe Contradicteth the Apostle, who in the sixteenth Verse will have the Private or Vulgarman to bee able to give consent to the publique Prayer, in saying Amen. And therefore re∣quireth the Minister, Verse 7. as the Harper, to yeeld in particu∣lar a Distinction of tunes [:] and Verse 8. as a Trumpeter, [] to give a certaine knowne sound; that which your owne Doctors have also confessed. A third Instance is taken out of Bellarmine, who saith that TheNon reprehendi∣tur oratio non intel∣lect, sed ei anteponi∣tur oratio quae intel∣ligitur, ut peter Vers. 17 [Tu quidem benè gratias agis, sed alter non aedisicatur] Bel∣lar. quo supra. Apostle reprehendeth not an unknowne Prayer, but prefer∣reth a knowne Prayer before the other, saying Verse 7. Thou, indeed, prayest well, but another is not edified. Flatly contradictorie to the whole scope of the Apostle, throughout the Chapter, as
your owneSalmer in les. See above Challenge 2. at the let. (z) Iesuite is forced to proclaime. The Apostle (saith hee) would have the people to be edified, because then all things ought to have beene done to the Edification and Consolation of the Assembly: and therefore hee would not, have any Publike Prayer used among the Hebrewes, but in the Hebrew-language; nor among the Grecians, but in Greeke, nor yet among the Latines, but in the Latine tongue. The meaning then is, [Thou indeed] namely, who art the Minister, and knowest the prayer, so far dost well; but in respect of others, which cannot understand, Not well, be∣cause, They are not edified. His fourth Objection hee wresteth out of the fourth Verse. [If I pray with my tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit.] So hee. As though that strange Tongue, here spoken off, were not understood by him that prayed. Which con∣tradicteth the Apostle, Verse 4. Hee that speaketh with the tongue doth edifie himselfe: for never did any denyt at hee, who had the miraculous gift of Speech in a strange tongue, did under∣stand himselfe, although sometimes he wanted the gift of Inter∣preting it, for the understanding of all others. Therefore saith the Apostle, Verse 13. [Hee that speaketh with the tongue, let him pray, that hee may interprete it.] Fiftly, by the word [Spirit] Id est, si orem dono linguae: nimi∣tùm, quam non in∣telligam, [Spiritus] id est Affectus meus orat, sed mens est fine fructu. Ergo dicit Apostolus, non O∣rationem, sed men∣tem esse sine fructu. Bellar quo sup And this answere Master Brerely borrowed from Bellar. Tract. upon the Masse. p. 452. your Cardinall would have understood the Affection, as if Affection without understanding did profit him that prayeth: which is fully contrary to the Apostles doctrine, as witnesseth yourVox [Spiritus] à principiō us{que} ad finem Donum Spiri∣tus peculiare signifi∣cat, quo impellebātur lingus loqui.

In the next place the aforesaid Anonymus contendeth by Reason, but such as others reached unto him. Fathers say (saith hee) the words of Consecration should be kept secret. True, to them that were not capable of this Sacrament, butSee this proved Booke 7. Chap. 3.{fleur-de-lys} never to the licensed Communicants; because that Christ, and his Apostles, yea and the Vniversall Church primitive consecrated in an au∣dible voice, and knowne language, as hath beene confessed. Yet furthermore. The Church (saith hee) used the said Hebrew word, Allelujah, unknowne to the people. What then? know you not
that in all Churches, of whatsoever language, is used also the Hebrew word, Amen? and if people doe not learne one or two words of a strange tongue, it is not for that they are wit∣lesse, but because they are wilfull and carelesse. Their last Reason. Some languages (as for example that in Italie) were Romane, and corrupted by invasion of Enemies of divers languages, and in the end became Italian, &c. yet the publike Service was not altered, but continued Romane as before. This Argument is à facto ad jus, all one with that Reasoning à Baculo ad angulum. Like as if some should conclude, that because Stewes are allowed at Rome, they are therefore justly licensed. But wee demand, are men made for languages, or rather langua∣ges for men? if the latter, then is that language to be used, which is knowne to serve best for the Edification and Consola∣tion of Gods people in his worship. A SIXT CHALLENGE. Out of the Doctrine of Antiquitie. ALthough it were preposterous to exact of us a proofe, from Antiquity, of condemning the Service in a strange tongue, seeing (as hath beene confessed) the Primitive practioe is wholly for us; and therefore no Abuse in those times could occasion any such Reproofe: yet shall wee, for your better il∣lumination, offer unto you some more expresse Suffrages of the ancient Fathers, after that wee shall have satisfied your Objecti∣ons, pretended to make for your Defence. Saint Augustine saith of the People, that their Safetie consisteth not in the vigour of their understanding, but in their simplicitie of believing. So in∣deed dothAug. de Bap. l. 6. c. 24. Multi irruunt in preces, etiam ab Hae∣reticis compositas, & per ignorantiae sim∣plicitatem non valen∣tes decernere, utun∣tur eis, & plerunque precis vitium superat precantis affectus.—Non quià ista corri∣genda non sint, ut populus ad id, quod plauè intelligat, dicat Amen. Idem de Cate∣chizand. rudibus c. 9. Teste Cassandro in Liturg. pag. 102. Augustine forewarne the people, who although they knew the single words of the prayers of Heretikes, yet might possibly be deluded with the obscuritie of their Here∣ticall Senses. The Difference is extreme. For Saint Angustines people understood the language of those prayers, in the obscure and involved Sense whereof they were unwillingly ignorant. But your Popish people are wilfully ignorant both of the Words and Sense. The oddes therefore is no lesse than this; they were simply, yours are sottishly ignorant: and Augustine wisheth that their Simplicitie were corrected; you hold your peoples blindnesse worthy to be commended. Secondly, Origen saith, that when Christians are exercised in reading of holy Scripture, albeit some words be not understood,
yet is that reading profitable. This Sentence also is alleged for countenancing ofOrigen. Hom. 20. in Ios Quae nos pro∣fermus aepe non in∣telligimus, sed virtu∣tes intelligunt. Ergo licet preces non in∣tellectis usurpare. O Bellar. l. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 16. Prayer in an unknowne tongue; notwithstan∣ding, that in a mans Reading of Scripture, God is said to speake un∣to man: but in Praying, man is said to speake unto God. So that it may be both lawfull and profitable to the Reader, to finde some particular Scriptures, which God would have to excell the Ca∣pacitie of the most learned, to humble them, to the admiration of his excellent wisedome, as the Fathers teach. Whereas contrarily an unknowne Prayer, wittingly used, is both unpro∣fitable and unlawfull, as hath beene copiously confessed by your owne Divines, from the Doctrine of the Apostle. More objections out of the Fathers you have not. Wee will try whether wee can recompence your Nominalities (that wee may so call your impertinent Objections) with Realties and so∣lid Proofes. Cast but your eyes upon the Marginals, consisting partly of the Relation of your owneIohannes Bil∣let in summa de di∣vinis officijs, In pri∣mitiva Ecclesia (in∣quit) prohibitum e∣rat, ne quis loquere∣tur linguis, nisi in∣telligerentur.—At nostris tempori∣bus, ubi nullus aut rarus inventur le∣gens, vel audien, qui intelligat, com∣pletum est quod à Propheta dicitur: E∣rit Sacerdos ut popu∣lus.

Augustine formerly hath resembled them. {fleur-de-lys}A SEAVENTH CHALLENGE, For Vindication, against Francis de Sancta Clara, a late Reconciler of our English Articles with the Doctrine of the Romish Church. A Romish professor at Doway published a Treatise this very yeare of our Lord 1634. VVhich hee calleth a Paraphrasticall Exposition of the Articles of the Church of Eng∣land; whose ayme is not to draw the Romish professors to the English, but the English to the Romish; and by his see∣ming Reconciliation to put upon our Church (as wee use to say) the Gull: albeit his whole Paraphrase be, indeed, no∣thing but a Farrago of his selfe-fictions, and Opinations, whereof his Paraphrasis or Exposition, upon this Article, will give you a shrewd guesse, if you shall have the patience to ex∣amine such stuffe. Our English ArticleFranciscus de S. Clara Professor Disac. Exposit. Artic. Confess. Angl. Art. 24 Linguâ populo non intellectâ preces pe∣ragere, & Sacramen∣ta administrare, ver∣bo Dei, & primitivae Ecclesiae consuetudi∣ni planè repugnat. saith, that To pray or administer the Sacrament in an unknowne tongue is plainely repugnant to the Word of God, and the Custome of the Primitive Church. The Article of the Church of Rome Contrarily:Concil. Trid. Sess. 22. Can. 9. Si quis dixerit, tantùm linguâ vulgari Mis∣sam celebrari debe∣re, Anathema sit. Hee that shall say that the Masse ought to be Celebrated onely in the vulgar tongue, let him be Anathema, that is, Accursed. The English Article hath two points. 1. That Prayer in a tongue unknowne to the People that pray, is Repugnant to the Word of God. 2. That it is also plainely Repugnant to the Custome of Primitive Antiquity. First of the Repugnance to the word of God. The Romish Expositor, Paraphrasing upon these words [Repugnant to the word of God,] supposeth in the first place that thereby is meant the Doctrine of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 14.
concerning Prayer in a Tongue not understood of him that pray∣eth: and then for answere thereunto, repeateth onely their old Crambe, to wit, that by Prayers, there spoken off, are not meant the publike prayers in the set and solemne service of the Church of Corinth; but other theirParaph, Cre∣diderim Sanctum Paulum vel de pri∣vatis conventibus, vel de privatis collo∣quiis, post omnia officia habitis, ibi agree. Private Con∣vents and Colloquies. And whereas, the Apostle requireth of the Idiote, that is, Private or Lay-man (as wee call him) that hee understand his Prayer so, as to be able to give con∣sent thereunto in publike, saying, Amen; heParaph. Idi∣ota apud Apostolum i. e. Ille cui incumbit respondere. expoundeth this as understood of Him, who by office answereth Amen for the rest of the People, whom wee name the Parish-Clerke. Both which have beeneSee the Chal∣lenges above thorow∣out. Confuted by your owne Schoole∣men; and the Latter more especially by Bellarmine himselfe, in our former Sections, as you have seene. A second devise of qualifying these words of our Article, [Repugnant to the word of God] is his owne, but thus:Paraph. De∣crevit igitur Articulus esse Repugnans Scrip∣turis, id est, non Doctrinae Scripturae, sed Scriptioni, seu Traditioni Scriptu∣rae, quae fuit Corin∣thijs in Lingua com∣muni. The Article decreeth it to be repugnant to the Scriptures, that is, (saith hee) not to the Doctrine of Scripture, but to the Scrip∣tion, or tradition of Scripture, which among these Corinthians was in praying in a common tongue. Here you have a dainty Distinction betweene the word, Scripture, and Scription; the word Scripture to signifie the Doctrine of Scripture, and the word Scription, to betoken Tradition of Scripture. So hee, by an elegant Figure, which wee forbeare to name, but wish there were some sense in it. For was it ever heard off, that there was a Scripture without Scription? that is to say, a Writ without writing; or when as all Divines ever distin∣guished of Traditions into  and  Written, which are the Scriptures themselves, and Vnwritten, which are without the same written word of God; Was it possible for them to conceive of a Tradition in Scripture, which was not Scripture or word of God? If so, then whereas all Creatures are distinguished into Sensible and Insensible, it shall be possible to point out a Sensible Creature void of Sense. His third Crotchet.Idem. Dum. dicit esse Repugnans verbo Dei, intelligi deberent Institutioni D. Pauli, non Chri∣sti, cujus scripta sub nomine verbi Dei comprehenduntur: omnia tamen ab A∣postolis demandata non sunt mandata Christi, ut ab om∣nibus concessum est. When the Article saith [Repug∣nant to the word of God] It is to be understood as meaning, Re∣pugnant to the Institution and Ordinance of Saint Paul, not of Christ, Saint Pauls writings being comprehended under the name of Gods word: although all that are commanded by the Apostles are not therefore the commands of Christ, as all do con∣fesse. So hee. That there are in Scripture Apostolicall Consti∣tutions, namely such as are fitted to the Churches, according to the Conveniences of the times, distinguished from Di∣vine Constitutions, which are enjoyned the Church, as ne∣cessary for all times, it is true. But that (both which this Paraphrase affirmeth) either St. Paul, in requiring a Knowno Prayer, delivered not therein the Doctrine of Christ, neces∣sary
for all times, or that our English Composers of this their Article (in affirming the Institution of Vnknowne Prayers to be Repugnant to the word of God) did not thereby understand the word and Commandement of Christ, in his Authenticall Scripture, are two as strange exorbitancies as your Glosser could make. For the Apostle, to shew that hee taught a Doctrine which concerned all the Churches of Christ, and at all times, useth Similitudes to Illustrate his meaning, universally fitting all ages and Congregations of Christians in their solemne pray∣ers. If a Trumpet, (saith hee) or a Pipe give an uncertaine sound, who shall prepare himselfe either to the Battell, or to the daunce? applying those Similitudes as well to praying, as to preaching in an Vnknowne tongue. But every one of you will grant that the same Scripture, for necessitie of preaching in a knowne tongue, is the Divine Instituti∣on of Christ, and not onely an Apostolique Constitution. Therefore (except you will separate that which Christ, by his Apostle, hath joyned together) you must confesse the same necessitie of the Command of Christ for knowne Prayer. Besides, his Conclusion [How shall hee that under∣standeth not, say Amen?] being as true of all Prayers, in all subsequent ages of the World, as it could be to the Church of Corinth, it prooveth the truth of the Divine Or∣dinance of Christ therein. Thus farre of the meaning of S. Paul, now to returne to our Article. Whereas you, and all that ever read Protestant Bookes know, that whensoever they affirme any thing to be Repug∣nant to the word of God, they meane to the Scripture, as it is the expresse Command and Ordinance of God, and of Christ; and that notwithstanding your Glosser should dare to tell us that the meaning of our Articling. [An unknowne Prayer to be Repugnant to the Word of God] must signifie, not Repugnant to Scripture, or to the Institution of Christ, but to Scription and Apostolicall Tradition; must needs ar∣gue, in your Professor, some ecclipse of judgement, by the which also hee venteth out his Inference following. A fourth straine he hath in his Inference from our English Article, as followeth.Idem. Vi hu∣jus verbi probabiliter inferri potest, debere Ecclesiae officia apud nos hodiè celebrari in lingua Latina, qui∣à per se loquendo est lingua communis, & communites intelle∣cta: solùm autem asseritur in Articulo, Preces publicae fiant linguâ à populo in∣tellectâ, quod sine dubio debet intelligi de lingua per se com∣muni, non per Acci∣dens loquendo. The Article affirmeth (saith hee) that Prayers ought to be used in a tongue knowne to the people, therefore wee properly inferre, that Prayers in our Church may be in Latine, because it is a language commonly knowne. So hee, speaking of your Romish Latine prayers, not knowne of your owne people. As if one should argue, saying, Because the kingdome of England holdeth it necessary that the plea∣ding of her lawes be used in English, in a tongue knowne and understood of her Subjects: therefore may it be thence Con∣cluded
that the Pleas of other kingdomes may be exercised in Latine, a common language, although not understood of the people of any Nation. Who seeth not in his Inference an extreme want of Logicke? A more full Confutation of the Glossers Qualification of the words of our English Article, viz. [Prayer unknowne is Repugnant to the words of God;] by his inter∣preting it, as not meant strictly of the do∣ctrine of Christ, but of the Tradi∣tion of the Apostle himselfe. It is most notoriously knowne to you all, that The same Ar∣ticle, against Vnknowne Prayers, is common to all the Chur∣ches of Protestants, in a full Accordance, to condemne the contrary Profession and practice of the Romane Church, which justifieth her Custome of praying in a Language un∣knowne to the people, as not Repugnant to the Law of God. And (reciprocally) you are not ignorant that your Councell of Trent, in her Anathema and Curse, cast upon all that should say, That the Masse ought to be celebrated in the vulgar tongue, intended thereby to accuse all Protestants for condemning the Custome of the Church of Rome, as a transgression of the word and Commandement of God in holy Scripture. Now this your Paraphrazer, by his Moderation and qualification indeavouring to reconcile these Two Contradictorie Inten∣tions, namely, of your Romish in condemning our English Article, and of our English Article, in condemning your Romish Canon: What it is but to affirme, that one Church hath opposed against the other for Causes they know not what? Of the second part of the English Article. The Article, [Prayer in an unknowne tongue is likewise Repugnant to the Custome of the Primitive Church.] The Glosser opposeth against this. HIS FIRST INSTANCE. Paraph. Grae∣ci apud omnes Iuris∣dictioni Patriarchae Constantinopolitani subditos, licèt Grae∣ci non sint, officia Idiomate Graeco ce∣lebrant. SOme, whose vulgar language is not Greeke, yet being under the Greeke Patriarch of Constantinople, pray in the Greeke Idiome. So hee, for proofe of the lawfulnesse of the peoples praying in a language unknowne. But the In∣stance is lame of the right legge; it sheweth indeed, and wee confesse, that many, whose native language is not Greeke, pray notwithstanding in the Greeke Idiome; but that they un∣derstand
and not these Greeke prayers (which is the onely point in question) it prooveth no more than Tenterton-steeple pro∣veth Goodwin-sands. For we haveSee above Sect. 7 thorow-out. manifested the contrary in a full Section, (namely) that all such People, who, being not Greekes, and prayed in the Greeke Idiome, did notwithstan∣ding understand that Greeke language wherein they prayed. Was your Paraphrazer in good tune, thinke you, when hee would not see this his marke, that he might speake to the pur∣pose and matter in question? Next, he being destitute of any other Instance in the Greeke Church, seeketh some other advantage in the Latine Church, in the dayes of Antiquity, from Saint Cyprian, and S. Augustine:Paraph. In Africa, ut testatur Cyprianus in orat. Domin. Et Augusti∣nus de bono perse∣verant. cap. 13. Mis∣sas, & reliqua faci∣ebant Latinè, licèt lingua vulgaris erat Punica, & Latina ab inferiori plebe non intellecta. They both witnesse (saith he) that their people in Africke said their Masse and other services in Latine, albeit their owne language was the Punicke, and that the meaner peo∣ple were ignorant of the Latine tongue. So hee, joyning his witnesse together; but wee will take them apart, to avoid Confusion, for the better confuting of your Paraphraser, if hee will yet thinke himselfe confuted. Cyprian is alleged to have said, as is premised, in his Exposition upon the Lords prayer: where there is not one syllable of mention of the people of Africke saying of Masse, or of their vulgar Punicke Language, or of their Ignorance of the Latine tongue. If this be not foule dealing, to produce a dumbe witnesse, and to father Sayings upon him, which hee never uttered, then will you thinke it farre more ougly, if the witnesse, being heard to speake himselfe, shall avouch the Contrary. Hearken then unto Cyprian, in the same Exposition of the Lords Prayer, instructing his Punicks and Africans as follow∣eth. Cypr. Sect. 22. Expos. in Orat. Dom.

Dearely beloved Brethren, when wee pray, wee ought to be watchfull, and attend our Prayers with our hearts, lest our mindes in praying thinke of any other thing, than on that which is prayed. So hee. Ergo, say Wee, The Africans, albeit their vulgar Idiome was Punicke, yet did they understand those Latine Prayers, which you your selves must likewise confesse, except any of your Priests could accordingly instruct your rude people, ignorant of the Latine tongue, wherein they pray, by saying unto them, Beloved Brethren, We, (that is, you and I) ought to attend to our prayers, and not thinke of any thing but that which is prayed. If any of you should so exhort your seely people, to attend to that they understand not, might they not interpret that his Exhortation to be no better than meere Mockerie; and as plaine an exprobration, as if hee should entreate a bald man to combe his head, or a blind man to thred a needle? Wee adde furthermore, that this Latine Exposition of the Lords Prayer was one of the Sermons of Saint Cyprian, and so
stiled in the same place, Sermo sextus, his sixt Sermon, prea∣ched promiscuously to all his people of Africke then assem∣bled. Which is a demonstrable Argument that this people of Africke understood the Latine tongue; you your selves pro∣fessing that Preaching ought alwaies to be used in a Language which the people do understand. Saint Augustine is his second Witnesse, but for what? namely, that The Africans, albeit their Nationall Language was the Punick, yet did they pray in the Latine tongue, whereof they were ignorant. So he. And Wee answer, that in the place alleged (which is his Booke de Bono perseverantiae, cap. 13.) there is no more mention of Punick tongue, or Latine Lan∣guage, than there is of Welsh, or Irish. It may be that Saint Augustine hath something hereof in some other place, and so indeed he hath: for in a Sermon of his unto the Africans, he speaketh hereof as plainely, as if in direct termes hee had given this your Paraphraser the word of disgrace.Aug. de Verbis Apostoli. Serm. 24. Proverbium notum est Punicum, quod quidem Latinè vobis dicam, quia Punicè non omnes nôstis; Nummum quaerit pestilentia. There is (saith hee, preaching unto his Africans) a knowne Proverbe in the Punick tongue, which I will render unto you in Latine, be∣cause all of you do not understand Punick: The Proverbe is this, The Pestilence seeketh money. So hee, shewing that the Afri∣cans understood Latine better than Punick, although this were their Nationall Language. Farre otherwise your Glosser, that the Latine was unknowne to the Africans, because their native language was Panick. Whereby hee bewrayeth a (Proverbially so called) Punick Faith. Flatly contradicting S. Augustine,August. lib. 1. Confess. cap. 14. La∣tina didici inter etiam blandimenta Nurricum. who furthermore confesseth of himselfe, saying, I learnt the Latine tongue from the fawning and flatte∣ring Speeches of my Nourses. Our Conclusion, by way of Censure of this mans Exposition of the Articles of the Church of England, and of the Romish Authorizers of the same Treatise. This one Point being the first of his Paraphrase, that fell in our way, concerning any doctrine appertaining to the Ro∣mish Masse, wee have beene the more Copious in Confuta∣tion thereof, that our Reader might take a just scantling of the judgement of this Paraphrazer in the rest; and of those who were the Censurers, Approvers, and Authorizers of the same: more principally Thomas Blacklous,Censura Tho∣mae Blacklouse de Li∣bellis de Articulis Con∣fessionis Angl.—Ca∣tholico animo con∣scriptis, ut Errantes ad Christi caulam re∣ditum inveniant. who shewes to what end this Tractate was writ, and approoved (as he saith) To bring those that wander out of the way unto the fold of Christ, Meaning, the Church of Rome. So then wee perceive it was not (as he seemeth to pretend) in the behalfe of Protestants, to free them from any of the former Censures and Anathe∣ma's, or from the curses and cruelties of the Romish Church
against them; but onely to ensnare them, if it may be, in the same Babylonish thraldome of Superstition and Idolatry, from whence by the marvailous and gracious providence of God they have beene delivered. Therefore, from these our Premises, VVee Conclude Blacklous and his fellow Privilegers of this Booke, to be guilty of all the above-manifested strange dealings, in per∣verting of the senses of the Articles and Authors by him alleged. Besides that, which surmounteth the rest, is the hai∣nous Crime of wilfull Perjurie, if they have taken the oath enjoyeth unto all Romish Priests by Pope Pius, after the Councell of Trent, swearing To expound no Text of Scripture, without the unanimous consent of ancient Fathers: yet now have allowed such an Exposition of the text of the Apostle, concerning Prayer in an unknowne tongue, which they were never able to justifie by any one Father of Primitive times, for the space of 600, that wee say not a thousand yeares after Christ, as hath beene sufficiently proved. Before Wee end, Wee should aske your Censurers, what Church of Rome it is, whose doctrine they would reduce Pro∣testants unto? Is it the old and primitive Religion of Rome? Why this is that which Wee so constantly professe. But meane they the Religion of the new Church of Rome, in her new Creede of new Articles, conformable to the Councel of Trent? Wee must say then of your Doctrine, as Christ said of Wine, No man drinking the Old, desireth the New, for hee will say, the Old is better. Luc. 5. 39.

Con∣fessions of your owne Iesuites will shew: first, that the Practice of the Apostles and Primitive Church, for above 500 yeares, was according to Christs Institution, to deliver the Bread into the hands of the Communicants. Secondly, that the same Order was observed at Rome (as appeareth by the Epistle of Pope Cornelius.) Thirdly, that whereas Some had devised, for Reverence-sake, certaine Silver vessels, by the which they re∣ceived the Sacrament; yet two Councels, the one at Toledo, and the other at Trullo, did forbid that fashion, and required that they should receive it with their hands. Hitherto from your selves. Vaine, therefore, is your pretence of Reverence, in suffering the Priest onely to receive it with his hands, as being more wor∣thy in himselfe than all the rest of the people: when as our High-Priest Christ Iesus disdained not to deliver it into the hands of his Disciples. Or else to deny this liberty unto the people, as if their Hands were lesse sanctified than their mouthes. But you will say that it is in Reverence, lest that the Body of Christ may (as you teach) light upon the ground, if any fragments of the Hoast should chance to fall. There can be no doubt, but that, in the dispensation of this blessed Sacrament, Christians ought to use due Cautelousnesse, that it may be done without miscarriage; yet must you give us leave to retort your pre∣tence of Reverence upon your selves, thus: Seeing that Christ himselfe instituted, and his Apostles observed, and that the whole Church of Christ (for so many hundred yeares) thus pra∣ctised the administration of this Sacrament from hand to hand,
without respect of such Reverence, they therefore were not of your opinion, to thinke every Crumme or piece of the Hoast, that falleth to the ground, to be really the Body of Christ.

As for them that came unpre∣pared, and as not intending to Communicate, they commanded them to be gone, and to be packing out of doores. To this purpose your owne Relator telleth you, from other Authors, of the practice of Antiquity, and of other succeeding Churches, in not suffering any to be present, but such as did Communicate; and of removing and expelling them that did not. Nor can the Church of Rome justly take exception at this, seeing that in the Romane Church also (in the dayes of Pope Gre∣gory the first,Sciendum est, juta antiquos Patres, quod soli Communicantes divinis officijs interesse con∣suverant.

Where wee see the religious wisedome of that ancient Church of Rome, which could not suffer a Sacrifice to devoure a publike Sacrament, and to exclude a Communion. Whereunto the Scriptures gave the name of , that is, a Gathering together, and , that is, a Communion; as also of The Supper of the Lord: Yea, and Calixtus, a Pope more an∣cient that Gregorie, required that persons present should Com∣municate:Ca∣lixtus P. ut habetur de Consecrat.

And why dost thou, impudent fellow, stand here still, not being one of them that participate there∣of? But enough. This then you perceive is a matter of no small importance, even by reason of the nature of this Sacrament, which is a Di∣vine Banquet; being also enjoyned upon the Catholike Church by that Command of Christ, [Do THIS.] Therefore the Command and Precept comming, maketh you Transgressors for not Eating; even as by the first Command given into man∣kind of [Eate not] our first Parents became Transgressors for Eating. So justly doth ourExhorta∣tion before the Communion. Church require, that Gazers, who Communicate not, should depart. Wee forbeare to repeate that which wee have formerlySee above Chap. 1. Sect. 2. proved (to wit) that you, by not dismissing the non-Communicants from beholding the celebration of this Sacrament, are condemned by the word, Masse, whereof you have so long boasted, untill that now your Glory is become your shame.

THis is the last Act of Christ, concerning the use of the first Element, viz. [Bread] saying, EATE YEE; even as hee said of the other, [Drinke yee;] and of both hee gave this his joynt Command [Doe this.] Wherefore this Act of Ea∣ting being thus prescribed, as the onely bodily outward end of this Sacrament, it doth exclude all other bodily Vses of mans invention. Accordingly our Church of England, Article 25. saith, Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be carried about, but to be duly used. The contrarie Canon of the Romane Masse.

And how unjustly you call this your Procession (onely for publike A∣doration) Laudable, wee are provided to demonstrate by the Confessions of your owne Iesuites and others (out of Cyprian, and other Fathers) who consulting first about Antiquitie, grant that, after the Celebration of the Eucharist, ancientlyPrisca consuetu∣do erat dandi Eucha∣ristiam infantibus, ut ex Cypriano & aliis constat: & si aliquae particulae superessent mos erat ut pueri im∣puberes, qui Ecclesi∣am frequentabant, accerderentur, ut eas consumerent.

How then can you call the Reservation of the Hoast, for publike Procession, and not for Eating, Laudable, which hath beene thus checked and gain-fayed by so syncere Antiquitie?

Lastly, lest you may object (as else-where) that a Negative Argument (as this, because Christ did not institute this Cu∣stome, therefore it may not be allowed) is of no effect; wee adde, that the Argument negative (if in any thing) then must it prevaile in condemning that Practice, which maintaineth any new End, differing from that which was ordained by Christ. Which made Origen and Cyprian argue Negatively in this Case: the oneChristus non distulit, nec servari jussit in crastinum. Orig. Hom. 5. in Le∣vit. Panis iste reci∣pitur, non includitur.

Which Conclusion wee may hold, in condemning of your pub∣like Carrying of the Hoast in the streets and Market-places, to the end only that it may be Adored, aswell as (of latter times) your Pope Pius Quartus (which your Congregation ofSic sanctiss. Sa∣cramentum ad infir∣mos deferendum est, ut illud sumant, non autem ut adorent tantùm; sicubi fit in aliquibus locis, quod Pius Quartus prohi∣buit Declaratio Rom. Cardinal. in Concil. Trid.

All these Premises doe inferre, that your Custome of Circumgestation of the Sacrament, in publike Pro∣cession, onely for Adoration, cannot justly be called Laudable, except you meane thereby to have it termed a Laudable Novel∣tie, and a Laudable prophanation, and Transgression, against the Institution of Christ; as now from your owne Confessions hath beene plainly evicted: and as will be further manife∣sted, when wee are to speake of yourIn the seventh booke.

So hee. Of this more in the Challenge. CHALLENGE. IS not now this your Churches Rejecting of her former Pra∣ctice a Confession that she hath a long time erred in Trans∣gressing of the Institution of Christ? How then shall your Trent-Fathers free your fore-father Pope Innocent, and your former Romane Church from this taxation? This they labour to do, but (alas their miserie!) by collusion and cunning: for the same Synod ofSancta Synò∣dus docet, Parvulos, usu rationis carentes, nullâ obligari neces∣sitate ad Sacramenta∣lem Eucharistiae com∣munionem—Ne∣que ideò tamen dam∣nanda est Antiquitas, si cum morem ali∣quando in quibus∣dam locis servârunt, quia certè eos nullâ salutis necessitate fe∣cisse, sine controver∣sia credendum est. Conc. Trident. Sess. 2. ca. 4. Trent resolveth the point thus; The holy Synod (say they) teacheth, that Children, being void of the use of Reason, are not necessarily bound to the Sacramentall receiving of the Eucharist. This wee call a Collusion; for by the same Rea∣son, wherewith they argue that Children are not nessarily bound to receive the Eucharist, because they want reason, they should have concluded, that Therefore the Church is and was necessa∣rily bound not to administer the Eucharist to Infants, even because they wanted Reason. Which the Councell, doubtlesse, knew, but was desirous thus to cover her owne shame, touching her for∣mer superstitious practice of Giving this Sacrament unto Infants. In excuse whereof, your Councell of Trent adjoyneth, that the Church of Rome, in those dayes, was not condemnable; but why? Because (saith yourSee the Testimony below of the letter (r.) Councell) Truly and without Controversie wee ought to believe, that they did not give the Eucharist unto Infants, as thinking it necessarie to Salvation. Which Answere your owne Doctors will prove to be a bold, and a notorious untruth, be∣cause

And so much the rather, because that which the Tridentine Fathers allege, for cause of Alteration, doth confirme this unto us: It is undecent (say they) to give the Eucharist unto Infants.

Ie∣suites spareth not to make a double cause of the Alteration of that Custome; one, to avoid the Vndecencie and Prophanation of the Sacrament (meaning, by the casting it up againe:) and secondly, because of the Heresie of those, who thought the Reociving of this Sacrament necessarie for the Salvation of In∣fants. Calling this opinion an Heresie.{fleur-de-lys} Wee dispute therefore. If the Church of Rome, in the dayes of
Pope Innocent the first, held it a Doctrine of faith, in the behalfe of Infants, that they ought to receive the Sacrament of the Eu∣charist; the same Church of Rome, in her Councell of Trent (whose Decrees, by the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth, are all held to be be∣leeved upon necessitie of Salvation) did decree contrarily that the participation of the Eucharist is not Necessary, no nor yet decent for Infants. Say now, did the Church of Rome not erre in the dayes of Pope Innocent? then is shee now in an errour. Or doth shee not now erre herein? then did she formerly erre, and consequently may erre hereafter, not onely in determining a matter to be Ne∣cessary to Salvation, which in it self is Superfluous and Vndecent, but also in opinion Hereticall. Thus of the contrary custome of the Church of Rome, in elder times. The now contrary Opinion, concerning the Romane Masse, at this day. Even at this day also your Iesuite will have us to understand the meaning of your Church to be, thatNon quòd Infantes sunt incapa∣ces hujus Sacramenti, sed quià hoc nunc magis expedit ad de∣centiam, & reveren∣tiam, quae aliquali u∣tilitati parvulorum praeferenda est.

were, resting you in the Kings name) produce against you Christ his Writ, the Sacred Scripture, whereby he requireth in all per∣sons about to Communicate three principall Acts of Reason; one is before, and two are at the time of receiving. The first is 1. Cor. 11. [,] Let a man examine himselfe, and so come, &c. The second [,] To discerne the Lords body. The third is [,] To remember the Lords death untill his coming a∣gaine. All which Three, being Acts of Iudgement, how they may agree unto Infants, being persons void of Iudgement, judge you. And remember, wee pray you, that wee speake of Sacramentall Eating, and not of that useSee above Sect. 10 before spoken of, touching Eating it after the Celebration of the Sacrament; which was for Consuming it, and not for Communicating thereof. CHAP. III. The Tenth Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Masse, by the now Church of Rome, is in contradicting the Sense of the next words following (concerning the second part of this Sacrament of receiving the Cup) [HE LIKE∣VVISE TOOKE THE CVP, AND GAVE IT TO THEM, SAYING, DRINKE YEE ALL OF THIS.] And adding, 1. Cor. 11. [DO THIS, AS OFTEN AS YOV DO IT, IN REMEM∣BRANCE OF MEE.] SECT. I. BY which words [Like maner of Taking, and Giving, and Saying, Drinke yee All of this] wee say that Christ ordained for his Guests as well the Sacramentall Rite of Drinking, as of Ea∣ting; and hath tied his Church Catholike in an equall obligation for performance of both, in the administring of this Sacrament. This Cause will require a just Treatise, yet so, that our Dis∣course insist only upon necessary points, to the end that the ex∣treme Insolencie, Noveltie, Folly, and Obstinacie of the Romane Church, in contradicting of this part of Christ his Canon, may be plainely displayed; that every conscience of man, which is not strangely preoccupated with prejudice, or transported with malice, must needs see and detest it. Wee have heard of the Canon of Christ his Masse.
The contrary Canon of the Romish Church, in her Masse. Shee, in her Councel of Constance, decreed thatChristus sub u∣traque pecie Disci∣pulis administravit—Licet in primiti∣vâ Ecclesiâ sub utra∣que specie hoc Sa∣cramentum recipe∣retur,—tamen haec consuerudo, ut à Lai∣cis sub specie pnis tantùm reciperetur,—habenda est pro lege, quam non licet reprobare, Conc.

Conc. Basil. apud AEneani Sylvium de gest ejusdem Concilij. Councell of Basil doth prove) from the authority of Christ his direction unto Peter, to whom he said, Tell the Church. We returne to the State of the Question. The full State of the Question. All Protestants, whether you call them Calvinists, or Luthe∣rans, hold, that in the publike and set celebration of the Eucharist, the Communion in both kinds ought to be given to all sorts of Com∣municants that are capable of both. The question, thus stated, will cut off a number of Impertinences, which your Objectors busie themselves withall, as will appeare in due places. Wee repeate it againe, [In publike Assemblies of all prepared, and capable of the Communion.] The best Method, that I could choose, for the expedite and perspicuous handling of this great Controversie, is by way of
Comparison: as namely, First, by comparing the Institution of Christ, with the contrarie Ordination and Institution of the Romane Church. Secondly, Christ his Example, with contra∣rie Examples. Thirdly, the Apostles Practice, with the adverse Practice. Fourthly, the Primitive Custome of the Church Ca∣tholicke, with the after-contrarie Custome; and the Latitude thereof, together with the latitude of the other. Fiftly, the Rea∣sons thereof, with Reasons. Sixtly, the divers manners of begin∣ning of the one, as also the Dispositions of men therein, with the repugnant manner and Dispositions of men in continuing the other. The discussing of all which points will present unto your view divers kinds of Oppositions. In the first, is the Conflict of Religion with Sacrilege. In the second, a soveraigne Pre∣sidence in Christ, with Contempt. In the third, of Faithful∣nesse with Faithlesnesse. In the fourth, of Antiquity with Noveltie. In the fift, of Vniversality with Paucity. In the sixt, of Wisedome with Folly: as also of Charity with Inju∣stice and Impiety. In the seaventh, of Knowledge with Igno∣rance; as likewise of Devotion with Prophanenesse. And all these marching and warring together, without any possibility of Reconciliation at all. The first Comparison is of the Institution of Christ with the Contrary: proving the Precept of Christ, for the Vse of Both kinds to all lawfull Com∣municants, SECT. II. THere is one word twice used in the tenour of Christ his Institution; once concerning the Bread, [HOC FA∣CITE] DO THIS:] the second time touching the Cup, 1. Cor. 11. 25.

But of what? this is our next Inquisition. And it is found, that All of them acknowledge Christs Praecept, simply for the Bread: and Some of them, onely, but conditionally of the Cup, whereof we are now to speake. The Acts of Christ were some belonging to Consecration, and some to Distribution, Manducation, and Drinking, Such as con∣cerned Consecration of both kinds, being with common con∣sent

To the other, touching Administration of the Cup, whereof it is sayd, [He tooke it, and gave it to his Disciples] whom after he had Commanded, say∣ing, [Drinke you all of this,] hee added the other Command set downe by Saint Paul, saying unto them, [Doe this as often as yee shall doe it in remembrance of Mee.] That by this Obligation hee might charge them to communicate in both kinds. A Pre∣cept then it must needs bee, But wee are not ignorant of your Evasions. Your first Evasion. Although (sayBellar. lib. 1. de Eucharistilia. cap. 25. §.

And although they were then Priests, yet we answere, that your Consequence, (viz.)

First, as fond, as if one should argue thus: It was at the first said only to the Apostles, Goe and baptize all Nations: Ergò none but the Apostles have Command to Baptize, which office you permit aswell to women Laicke, as to men. Next pernicious, for say (Wee pray you) doe the words, [Drinke yee all of this] com∣mand all Priests to drinke? then must this condemne the con∣trary See above in this Chapter at the letter (b.) Practice of your now Church of Rome, which allow∣eth the Cup to no Priest present, but onely to him that doth Conse∣crate: which is directly confuted by the Example of Christ, who administred the Cup, unto all his Apostles, by your do∣ctrine, Priests. Againe, Do these words onely command the Priest to re∣ceive the Cup? then likewise do you condemne your former Church of Rome, which hath sometime permitted the Cup unto Laike.

Which hee holdeth to be so manifest a Truth, that hee thinketh no man to be so blinde, as not to discerne it, saying, Who seeth not this? Accordingly he allegeth Solo, for the old Schoole, concluding that the words [Drinke yee all of this, as often, &c.] Do simply command the act of Drinking: or else (saith he) the Church hath no ground, for the Priest that conse∣crateth, to celebrate in both kinds. And this Obligation Cardi∣nall Credimus eos rectè oblagari, dùm militainus in hac vi∣ra, ad Sacramentum Fucharistiae, eo mo∣do, quo perfectiùs significat Passionem: id est, sub utraqu specie, &c.

Sect. 4. pag 407. And Tra. 4. Sect. 7. pag. 421 [As often:] not sig∣nifying the necessitie of Drinking. Brerely may see, and acknowledge his double Errour. And, indeed, the Evidence is so great, that although all Ro∣mish Vniversities should withstand it, we might herein appeale to common Sense: for Christ having first commanded his Disciples, saying, in the Celebration of this Sacrament, [Drinke yee all of this;] this is the Act: and adding further, saying, [As often, or whensoever as yee shall drinke it, do this in remembrance of mee,] which is the End so commanded; it doth equally im∣ply a command of the Act of Drinking, aswell as of the End. Now the Catholike Church did alwayes hold, that there ought to be an Often Commemoration of the Passion of Christ, even untill his comming againe (as saith the Apostle) by the Ce∣lebration of this Sacrament. And the word [] As often, or whensoever yee receive, &c. (being indefinite, and assigning no certaine dayes or times) giveth libertie to the Church to solem∣nize this Memoriall at her convenient times; yet so, that When∣soever the Church celebrateth this Sacrament, shee do it accor∣ding to the forme of Christ his Institution, by communicating in both kinds. {fleur-de-lys}Yet is not this all, but if you desire an Argument of Gods wonderfull Providence, you may see it in this, in deli∣vering up your owne Cardinals to that Stupidity, as to be caught in their owne subtilty, by the cleare light of the Text, well discerned by your Divines ofEnchirid. Co¦loninse de Sacramen. Euch. verb [Hujus.] Divus Paulus apetius reliquis habet: Quo∣tiescun{que} manduca∣veritis hunc panem, & poculum hoc bib∣tis, mortem Domini annuntiabitis. 1. Cor. 11. 26. Colen in these words of Saint Paul, [As often as you do eate this Bread, and drinke this Cup.] Do you marke? the [Quotiescunque,] is applyed equally to both, The eating of the one, and Drinking of the o∣ther. If then their Consequence were good, that the Church, by virtue of that [Quotiescunque,] had a libertie to abstaine from the Cup, it would follow that (against the universall do∣ctrine of both sides) the Church might celebrate the Com∣munion without distribution of either of both, whereof more in the next Section. If the Pope, sitting in the Assembly of his Cardinals, delive∣ring unto each of them a Ring, to put upon their thumbes, should say, Do this as often as you come before mee, in testi∣monie
of my love: (Wee demand) Are they not, as often as they come into the presence of that Pope, chargeable to put on each one his Ring upon his thumbe, by virtue of the Popes Command? [Do this] who seeth not this, that doth not wil∣fully blind-fold and stupifie his wits? Shall wee conclude? As your owne Doctors inferre from these words of Christ [Do this] that Laicks, who be of yeares, are bound by the Law of God to communicate: by the same Text may wee conclude, that they are likewise obliged to participate of the Cup. {fleur-de-lys}And although our Argument, taken from the words of Christ [Do this as often] seeme to be hereunto of no force with your two Cardinals, who spy therein a wonderfull gappe of libertie for a non-use of the Cup, in the celebration of this Sacrament; yet your Councell of Trent pronounceth thatSee afterwards Sect. 4. at the letter (a) and Sect. 6. at (m). The Priest by these words. [Do this as often as, &c.] is commanded to consecrate in both kinds; Which indeed ought to be unto us an Argument of the singular Providence of God, to see the Adversaries of his Truth, to be Babylonishly Confounded by the Contrarietie of their owne tongues. THE CHALLENGE, In Generall. DO this] are (as you have heard) words Commandatorie, and being spoken of Both kinds, aswell for Consecration, as for Distribution, do oblige the Church of Christ to performe both kinds: so that it must needs follow, that the neglect of the Act is a Transgression of the Precept of Christ. And so much the rather ought you to be perswaded hereof, because your choicest and most subtile Objecters, when, seeking to de∣fend your Alteration, it became them to reason discreetly con∣cerning this Sacrament (which the Fathers call , the Cup of Sobriety) yet do argue so intemperatly, as though they had beene over-taken with some other Cup: insomuch that they are confuted by their owne learned fellowes, by evi∣dent texts of the Evangelists, and by common sense; Which gi∣veth us just cause to turne their Wonderment against themselves, saying, Behold the Providence of God! thus plainely to confound the wisedome of the Adversaries of his truth by themselves, in their greatest subtilnesse. Hitherto of the Comparison of the Ordinance of Christ with the Ordinance of the Romish Church.
Our second Comparison is of the Example of Christ, with the contrary Example. SECT. III. WEre it that wee had no Precept of Christ to [Doe this] but onely the Example of his Doing it in the first Insti∣tution, this should bee a Rule for us to observe it punctually, excepting in such Circumstances, which onely occasionally and accidentally happened therein, asSee above Sect 2. hath beene prooved; and therefore not to dare to give a Non-obstante against the Ex∣ample of Christ, as yourSee above in this Chapter Sect. 1. lit. (a.) Councell of Constance hath done: and whichRectè docent Iurisconsulti, non e∣xemplis sed legibus judicandum.—Quae ab exemplis ducuntur argumenta per locum sunt à simili, quae non tàm ad aliquid firmandum, quàm ad id quod firmatur il∣lustrandum à Diale∣cticis esse traduntur. Salmeron. les. Tom. 9. Tract. 34. your Iesuite also teacheth, as if the Example of Christ were no argument of proofe at all. Which Doctrine wee are now to trie by the judgement of Antiquity.Cyprian. con. Aquarios Epist. 63. Admonitos nos sci∣as, ut in Calice offe∣rendo traditio obser∣vetur, neque aliquid fiat à nobis, quàm quod pro nobis Do∣minus prior fecerit. [And some-what af∣ter] A divino Ma∣gisterio non receda∣mus. Cyprian confuteth the Aquarij (Heretikes that used onely Water in the Chalice) by the Example of Christ his Institution, because Nothing is to bee done of us, in celebrating of this Mystery, which was not done of Christ. So hee. In the dayes of Pope Iulius, Anno 337. there arose many gid∣die spirits, which violated the holy Institution of Christ, in this Sacrament, when as some Consecrated Milke instead of Wine: others sopped the bread in the Cup: a third sort squiezed Grapes thereinto. These, and the like, that holy Pope did condemne, but how? by pretence of Custome only? no, but by the obliga∣tion of Christ his Example, and Institution of this Sacrament, in these words following:Iulius P. apud Gratian de Consecra: Ca. Cum omne. Au∣divimus quosdam, Schismaticâ ambiti∣one detentos, contra divinos ordines & Apostolicas iustitutiones, lac pro vino, in divinis officijs dedicare: alios intinctam Eu∣charistiam populo pro complemento communionis porrigere: quosdam etiam expressum vinum in Sacra∣mento Dominici Calicis afferre: Alijs vero pannum lincum, musto intinctum, per totum annum reservare, & in tempore Sacrificij partem ejus aquâ lavare, & sic offeire. Quod cùm sit Evangel. cae & Apostolicae doctri∣nae contrarium, & consuetudim Ecclesiasticae adversum, non difficilè ab ipso fonte veritatis probatur, à quo ordinata ipsa Sacramentorum mysteria processerunt. Cùm enim Magister veritatis verum salutis nostrae Sa∣crificium suis commendaret Discipulis, nu lac, sed panem tantùm & Calicem sub hoc Sacramento nosci∣mus dedisse. Legitur enim in Evangelica veritate, [Accepit Iesus Panem & Calicem, & benedicens dixit Di∣scipulis suis] Cesset igitur Lac in Sacrificando offerri, quià manifestum & evidens veritatis exemplum illuxit, quià praeter Panem & Vinum aliud offerri non licet. Illud verò quod, pro complemento Communio∣nis, intinctam Eucharistiam tradunt populis, nec hoc prolatum ex Evangelio testimonium receperunt, ubi corpus suum Apostolis commendaret & sanguinem: scorsim enim panis, & scorsim Calicis commendatio emoratur. Because these are contrary (saith he) to Evangelicall and Apostolicall doctrine, and Ecclesiasticall Custome, as is easily proved from the fountaine of truth, from whence the Sacraments had their first ordinance; for when our Ma∣ster of Truth commended this to his Disciples, hee gave to none Milke, but Bread onely, and the Cup. Nor doth the Gospell mention the sopping of Bread, but of giving Bread a-part, and the Cup also a-part, &c. So Pope Iulius.
{fleur-de-lys}Long after this, the Councel of Braccara (about the yeare of our Lord 675) withstood the Complementall Custome of receiving both kindes in dipped soppes: but wot you why? hearken; even becauseConc Braccar. 3. cap. 1. Iliud verò, quod pro comple∣mento Communio∣nis intinctam tradunt Eucharistiam popu∣lis; nec hoc prosa∣tum ex Evangelio re∣cipit, ubi Apostolis corpus suum & san∣guinem commenda∣vit: seorsim enim panis, & seorsim ca∣licis commendatio memoratur. Apud Binium, Tom. 2. It is not reveiled in the Gospell of Christs Institution. Ponder the Testimony in the Margin, and you shall find it point-blanke contradictorie to your opi∣nion and practice. Which Reasoning of the Bishops of that Councell had beene very loose and lavish, except they had beleeved that the forme of Institution of Christ, concerning the Participation of both kindes, was as Commandatorie, as∣well for the People, as the Priest. Those also that offered Bread and Cheese together, in this Sa∣crament, are confuted by the Institution of Christ, who appoin∣ted Bread, saithArtotyritae pa∣nem & caseum offe∣runt: qui excludun∣tur per hoc, quòd Christus hoc Sacramentum instiruit in pane. Aquinas, part 3. quaest 24. Art. 1. your Aquinas. What can bee more direct and absolute? yet dare your men object to the contrarie. The Romish Objection answered. At Emmaus, Luke 24. Christ, meeting with certaine Disci∣ples, taking bread and blessing it, and thereby manifesting him∣selfe to them, is said immediately after the Breaking of Bread to have vanished out of their sights. Ergò, it may be lawfull (saith yourEx Luc. 24 30. Vbi Christus appa∣tens duobus Discipu∣lis in Emmaus, & accumbens accepit panem, & benedixit, & dedit eis: quo facto, aperti sunt oculi comm, & evanuit ex oculis, &c.

So also Ruffensis, and others. Cardinall) to use but one kinde. Because (saithMaster Brereley Li∣turg. Tract. 4. §. 3. pag. 402. Master Brerely) the Text sheweth, that Christ vanished away, not lea∣ving any time for Benediction, or Consecration of the Cup. CHALLENGE. THis Argumentis is still inculcated, almost, by every Romanist, in defence of the Romish Custome of but in one kind, not∣withstanding it be twice rotten. First, in the Root and Antece∣dent. For although Christ here had begun the Celebration of the Eucharist, yet doth it not appeare that he did now perfect it, in distributing either kinde to his Disciples; Nor is this likely, saith yourChristum hanc Eucharistiam porre∣xisse, sententia est incerta, & non veri∣sim. lis, Iansen. Con∣cord. c. 126 p. 1070. Iansenius. And it is dead-rotten also in the branch and Consequence thereof, because that this Act of Christ in Emmaus is not to bee urged, as an Example to be imi∣tated in the Church; which is demonstrable by an acknow∣ledgment,

As for example. The Councel of Trent hath defined that the Priest, in Consecrating, is cōmanded by Christ his Institution to consecrate in both kinds; Because this (saith your Iesuite) both the nature of the Sacrifice and Sacrament doth exact: but by what words of Command? name∣ly (for so he saith) by these words, [Do this as often, &c.] Accor∣dingly your ObjectourLiturg. Tract. 4. §. 2. pag. 401. Master Brerely (as if hee had meant purposely to confute, and confound himselfe) The reason why the Priest receiveth both kinds, is, because hee is to represent the Sacri∣fice of Christ upon the Crosse. But Bread cannot represent Christ dead, without some signe of Bloud. {fleur-de-lys}Your Scottish Iesuite will prompt your English Priest, to say, that there may be aIac. Gordon. Scotus les. lib. Contro. 8. cap 4. In conse∣cratione et sump∣tione unius speciei est perfecta memoria mortis Christi—quae imperfecta dici potest integraliter, sed non essentialiter. Num. 19.

Perfect commemoration of Christs death by consecration of but one kinde: and that Christ did not command the Consecration of Both, as necessary. This hee fetcheth from the former Example of Christ at Em∣maus; whom notwithstanding your IesuiteVasques les. in 3. Thom. Disp. 222. cap. 4. per totum.

Vndè rectè fequitur, unae tantum speciei consecrationem, pro sacrificio Christi cruento, non fuisse à Christo institutam. Vasquez (if peradventure hee cannot reforme) will surely refute, even from your owne Romish Principle, which teacheth that the Sacrifice of the Masse is an unbloudy Sacrifice in it selfe, yet Commemorative and Representative of Christs death and Pas∣sion; which was by the Effusion and Separation of Bloud from his Body. But this (saith he) cannot be represented  by one kinde. And thereupon hee Concludeth that Christ instituted the Consecration of this Sacrament in Both kindes. If then, because Christ ministred it not in Both kindes in Em∣maus, it shall be lawfull for the Church to imitate him in that manner of Distribution of this Sacrament, it must as equally follow, that because hee is not found there to have Consecra∣ted in both kindes, it may be lawfull for your Consecrating Priest so to do; not onely contrarie to your now Romane Cu∣stome; but also (in the judgement of the Councell of Trent) con∣rary to the Command of Christ, asSee above. See also hereafter Sect. 6. hath beene confessed. Twice miserable therefore is the darknesse of your Disputers, First, not to see the Inconsequence of this Objection: and next
not to remember that common Principle, to wit, Extraordinary Acts (such as this was) are not to be Rules for ordinary Duties. {fleur-de-lys}Wherein, that the Vnconscionablenesse of all your Ob∣jectors may be made more transparent, We adde out of your Schooles, that Christs Acts of Excellencie, (that is, which are proper to his owne Soveraignty) are neither Dispensable, nor Imitable. And such was this his abrupt not-dispensing of Both kinds unto his Disciples. Say, Father Vasquez, is not this most true?Vasquez. Ies. in 3. Thom Disp 23. cap. 3. Supremâ au∣thoritate coram Di∣scipulis in castello Emmäus alterā tan∣tùm speciem conse∣cravit.—quod qui∣dem eo tempore fieri maximè expe∣dibat, cùm sttim in fractione panis ag∣nis is est.—Non possit Pontifex hanc obligationem Sacer∣dotibus relaxare. Christ (saith this Iesuite) now at Emmaus consecrated but in one kinde, by his Supreme authority; so pro∣per to Christ, that the Pope himselfe cannot dispence with any Priest, that he should not consecrate in Both. So he. With what Conscience then could your Objectors urge this Example of Christ, for the Priests administring the Sacrament but in One kinde, which they themselves did see could not justifie either your Priests, or Popes, consecrating but in One kinde? A SECOND CHALLENGE. VVEe conclude. You have seene, by the testimonies of Cyprian, and Pope Iulius, that it was good Divinity, in their dayes, to argue from the Example of Christ his Institution negatively; by rejecting such Acts, and accounting them as contrarie to the Institution of Christ, which accord not with his Example, and which are not comprized within the Canon of Christ his [Hoc facite.] Which kinde of Reasoning, at this day, is hissed at in your Romish Schooles. What need many words? O tempora! Our third Comparison, is, by conferring Apostolicall Pra∣ctice with contrary Practice. SECT. IV. Saint Paul having more speciall occasion to handle this point, than any other of the Apostles, may worthily be admitted to resolve us in the name of all the Rest. Hee Catechizing the Corinthians, concerning the true use of the Eucharist, recordeth the first Institution, thus:1. Cor. 11. 23. I have received of the Lord that which I deliver unto you, that the Lord Iesus, &c. And, after his Re∣citall of the Institution of Christ, hee himselfe addeth [Ibid. Vers. 26. As often as you eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup, you shew the Lords death untill hee come againe.Ibid. Vers. 28. Let therefore a man examine himselfe, and so eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup.] From this wee seeke a Proofe both of the Apostolicall Practice, in the use of Both kindes, in this Sacrament; and of our duty in
observing the same. But we may spare our paines of proving the use of Both kindes in the Church of Corinth, because (as your Antiqua Con∣suctudo temporibus Apostolorum fuit in Ecclesia, sub utraque specie communican∣di. In hac assertione nulla est Controver∣sia. Tolet. Ies. in Ioh. 6. pag 602. So Ecchius Hom. 36. Nullum insiciari posse, Pau∣lum hoc praecipisse Corinthijs. Cardinall Tolet confesseth) There is no controversie thereof. As for the Proofe of our necessary Conformity, wee have the same Reasons, wherewith the Apostle perswadeth there∣unto, [That (saith he) which I have received of the Lord, I deliver unto you, that Iesus, &c.] Thereby applying the Example of Christ his Institution for a Rule of their Practice: which this conjunctive Particle of Eating [AND] Drinking; To Eate [AND] Drinke, five times so coupled in this Epistle, do plain∣ly declare. But you tell us, that in this place the Conjunctive [AND] is put for a Disjunctive, Or, thereby to teach the Church a liberty to choose whether they shall eate or Drinke: notwithstanding, you your selves have confessed that Christ spake absolutely, and without Condition, of the Bread, Take, Eate, Do this. And againe, 1 Cor. 11. 24. [, And in like manner the Cup.] It is an AND Conjunctive, questionlesse. For seeing it cannot be denyed, that the Apostles Practice was both Eating and Drinking conjunctively, it is not likely or credible that the sense of his words should be discretive; because this had beene, in words, to have contradicted his owne practice. Master Brerely opposeth, viz. The Apostle in the same Chapter saith v. 20 Hee that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgement; also he saith vers. 27. whosoever eateth this Bread, and drinketh this Cup unworthily, &c. So he. It is not to be denyed but that [AND] is often used in Scrip∣ture for, [Or:] but Master Brerely his notions, as commonly else-where, so here also are too confused, by not distinguishing the divers use of [AND] namely, in Precepts, and Exhorta∣tions to an Act, from AND, in denunciation of judgement, in case of Transgression. As for example, The Precept is, Honour thy father, And thy mother, (Exod. 20.) here [AND] must needs be copulative, because of the Obligation of Precept of honou∣ring Both. But the denunciation against the Transgressour, if it stood (as Master{fleur-de-lys}Mr. Brerely in his Lit. Tract. 4. §. 7. Vsual it is in Scrip∣ture to use the Con∣junctive, ET, And, for the Disjunctive. So it is sayd, he that shall strike his Fa∣ther and Mother, shall die. When as both the Originall, the Roman Vulgar, and our Translations have it. (OR.){fleur-de-lys} Brerely objecteth, feigning a false Text contrary both to the Originall, and vulgar Latine Translation) thus, Hee that shall strike his father, And mother, shall die: the particle [AND] must needs be taken disjunctively for, Or, (as indeed it is expressed in the Text) because the Transgression of either parts of a Commandement inferreth an obliga∣tion of guilt and judgement, as any man of sense may per∣ceive. Against this, albeit so evident a Truth, your Doctors will have something to object, or else it will go hard; even forsooth the contrarie practice of the Apostles, Act. 2. 42 where wee read of the faithfull assembled and Continuing together in fellow∣ship,
and in breaking of bread, and in prayers; because there is but mention onely of one kinde, which is Bread: whence they in∣ferre a no-necessity of using the Cup. So yourAct 2. Ita de∣scribitur com unica∣tio Eucharistiae [E∣rāt enim persevoran∣tes in doctrin Apo∣stolorum, & commu∣nicatione fractionis panis, & Orationi∣bus.] Quo in loco negari non potest quin agatur de Eu∣charistia.

And to answer, that the ministration of the Cup is understood by a figure Synechdoche, is an Answer onely imaginary and groundlesse, saith MasterLiturg. Tract. 4. §. 3. pag 403. Brerely. But are they yet to learne that which every man knoweth, and your owne Iesuites have taught? that there is no Trope more familiar in Scripture than this Synechdoche of taking a part for the whole? Or could they not discerne thus much in the same Chapter, ver. 6. where it is sayd, They brake bread through every house; Wherein (as your IesuiteExistamo de Eu∣charistia non esse Sermonem, quonium de illo superiùs paulò Sermo habitus est. Lorin. les in eund. loc. And Cajetan. Card. Febat distributio pa∣nis—ita quod acei∣piebant cibus erat. Comment in und. loc. Lorinus reacheth) there is not meant the Eucharist, but common foode? Whereby you can∣not but understand implied, in their breaking of bread, their mu∣tuall drinking together also. And yet in the like words spoken of the Eucharist, verse 42. [They continued together in breaking of Bread] you exclude the participation of the Cup. What shall wee say? was your spirituall appetite weaker than your corpo∣rall, in reading these two Texts, wherein is mentioned onely Bread, that you could discerne but halfe refection in the Eu∣charist, and an whole in their bodily repast? {fleur-de-lys}Not to trouble you with the repeating of SomeMatth. 16. The Disciples are accused for eating bread with unwashed, hands, Mark. 3. They had no leisure to eate bread Luc. 12. Christ to the Pharisees house eate bread. 2. Thess. 3. We have not eaten our bread freely, &c. few Scriptures, among many, wherein the word, Bread, alone doth by a Senechdoche necessarily unply a perfect and full Refecti∣on; else men (you know) should be clemmd, who should have Bread onely, without Drinke. Besides, any man may guesse what spirit it favoureth of, that (in paralleling the authority of your Church with the authority of the Apostles) your Iesuites doe resolve, that although the Apostles had constituted the Custome of Receiving in both kindes,Si daremus hunc ritum ab Apostolo fuisse traditum, cum tamen merè positivus sit, potuillet illum mutare, quid Ecclesia habet eūdem spiri∣tum, & eandē autho∣ritatem cum Paulo. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34. p. 277. Eodem modo Vasquez les. in 3. Thom. Disp. 215. 216. Nihilo minus Ecclesia & summus Pontifes poterit illud justis de causis abrogare; licet concederemus praeceptum hoc fuisse Apostolicum. Neverthelesse (say they) the Church of Rome, and Pope thereof, having the same authoritie with Saint Paul, may abro∣gate it upon just Cause. And yet hardly can you allege any Cause, for abrogation of that Practice, which Saint Paul might not have assumed in his time. CHALLENGE. OFrustrà susceptos Labores nostros! may wee say; for to what end is it for us to prove an Apostolicall Practice, or Pre∣cept for Both kinds, when your Objectors are ready with the onely names of Pope and Church of Rome to stoppe the mouthes not onely of Vs Heretikes (as you call us) but even of Saint Paul himselfe, and of the other Apostles, yea, and of Saint Peter too?
By which Answere notwithstanding you may perceive how little Saint Paul doth favour your cause, by whose Doctrine the Advocates for your Church are driven to these straits: but more principally if you call to remembrance, that our Argu∣ment is taken from the Apostles Doctrine and Practice, as it was grounded by St. Paul himselfe upon the Doctrine and Precept of Christ. Thus, when wee appeale unto the Apostles Tradi∣dition, you, by opposing, Thinke your selves wiser than the A∣postles: which Irenaeus will tell you was the very garbe of old Cùm ad eam Traditionem, quae ab Apostolis, pro∣vocamus eos, dicent se Apostolis existen∣tes superiores, since∣ram ingenisse veita tem.

Wher∣fore, hearken but unto the Marginals, and you shall finde your Iesuites, with others, uttering these voyces:Olim per multa secula sub utra{que} spe∣cie gebatur Lai∣cis, ut ex multorum Sanctorum scriptis didicimus.

For our defence is o∣ly this, that in the publike solemnization and Celebration of this Sacrament, in an Assembly of Christians freely met to com∣municate, no one example can bee shewne in all Antiquity, throughout the Catholike Church of Christ, for the space of a thousand yeares, inhibiting either Priest, or Laick, from Communicating in both kindes, who was duly prepared to re∣ceive the Sacrament.

Hitherto of the Primitive Custome. Notwithstanding all this, will your Romane Church boast of her contrary Custome of after-times, telling us, in her Councels, that her Custome of administring the Eucharist but in one kinde is rightly observed, as a Custome, which hath beene [Diutissi∣mè observata, ] that is, of very long continuance.

Salmeron: It is certaine (saith he) that the Church, for these three or two hunded yeares, hath used to communicate to the Laity under one kinde. So they.
CHALLENGE. NOw after that wee have proved, out of your owne Con∣fessions, the length of the Custome of Both kindes to have beene in the Continuance above a thousand yeares, after the first Institution of this Sacrament; and for largenesse thereof, in an universall consent thereunto, without any exception by any example ordinary, publike, and legitimate; and that you have heard also even the Fathers of your Church opposing against it a contrarie custome not above the Compasse of three hundred yeares, and yet to call it [Diutissima] A Custome of longest continu∣ance; what Tergiversation could be more shamelesse? But e∣nough of this point. In the next place, because the same your Councel hath told us, that your contrary Custome was brought in [Rationabiliter,] with good Reason, wee are forth-with to dis∣cusse the Reasons thereof. Our sixt Comparison is of Reasons, for the Vse of Both kindes, collated with Reasons objested to the contrary. SECT. VI. A Sacrament (according to the common definition) is a Visi∣ble signe of an invisible Grace; and so farre is a Signe true and perfect, as it doth fully represent the things that are ordained to be signified thereby: Signification being the very proper na∣ture and end of a Signe, as well in sacred, as in prophane Rites. Come now and let us industriously and calmly debate this mat∣ter, which wee have in hand, both in respect of the thing signi∣fied (which is the Sacrament, or spirituall Object) as of the party Communicating, who is the Subject thereof. Our first Reason is taken from the due Perfection of this Sacrament, which must necessa∣rily be in Both kindes. The things Spirituall (as all Christians professe) are the Body and Blood of Christ, which are signified in the Sacrament of Bread and wine; These two then are not two Sacraments, but one Sacrament formally, (as youSee afterwards at the letter (m.) know) which therfore ought to be performed in Both, or else the Act will be a Sacrilegious dismembring of the Sacrament of Christ. This shall we easily
prove from the Principles and Confessions of your owne Schooles. Your Church professeth to celebrate the Eucharist, both as it is a Sacrifice, and as it is a Sacrament. As you hold it to be a Sacrifice, you generally teach that Both kinds are necessarily to be received of the Priest, because they both belong to the Essence thereof. So yourSed nos nullam scimus Sacramenti mutilationem, ne{que} partem dimidiam Laicis esse substra∣ctam, siquidem duae species requiruntur necessariò ad Sacri∣ficium, sed ad essenti∣am Sacramenti quae∣libet ex duobus suf∣ficit.—Proinde Sa∣cramentum sub spe∣cle panis est verum & integrum Sacra∣mentum, quandò su∣mitur per modum ∣nius refectionis.

Aqui∣nas, your Iesuites Valentia, and Vasquez, and they will say as much in behalfe of the Eucharist, as it is a Sacrament; their rea∣son is, Because both kindes, making but one Sacrament, ought to be celebrated perfectly, and therefore is the Priest bound to consecrate this Sacrament in both kindes by that command of Christ, saying, [Do this:] nor can this be omitted without Sacrilege. So they. If such be the necessity of consecrating in both kindes, under the hand of the Priest, then lieth the same obligation upon the Church likewise, for distributing it in both kindes unto the people, to whom it is to be administred, in token of Christ his Passion for them applicatorily, both in his Body and Bloud: but the Bread only can no more represent the Blood of Christ in the mouthes of people, in the eating thereof, than it can by Con∣secrating it in the hands of the Priest: and consequently the dismembring thereof, as you do, must necessarily condemne both Priest and People. A Consequence, which your figment of See hereafterr, Sect: 8. Concomitancie cannot possibly avoid. A Corroboration of the same Reason, against the Sacrilegi∣ous dismembring of this Sacrament, by the Testimony of Pope Gelasius; and a Vindication of Doctor Morton from the Traducement of other your Priests and Iesuites. SECT. VII. THe Hereticall Manichees forbare the use of the Cup in this Sacrament, in an opinion, that wine was not created by God, but by some evill spirit; whom Pope Gelasius did therefore con∣demne by his publike Decree: which Hereticall opinion (as once IAppeal. lib. 2. Chap. 1. pag. 140. said) cannot justly be imputed unto the Church of Rome, in her manner of abstaining from the Cup in the Eucharist. This
SayingIn his Answer to his Majestie. Master Fisher the Iesuite, of late, thought good to pervert to his owne use, thus. The Crime wherewith some Pro∣testants charge us, that our receiving under the sole forme of Bread is to jump in the opinion of the Manichees, wee may (as Doctour Morton confesseth) reject as injurious, saying with him, that it was not the Manichees abstinence from wne, but the reason of their forbearance that was judged Hereticall. So hee. But this mans march is but slow. Master Brerely,In his Booke of the Liturgie of the Masse, Tract. 4. §. 4. pag. 407. a Romish Priest, one well esteemed among you, for his exceeding labour and paines in defending the Ro∣mish Cause, to his power, by his many Bookes, almost in eve∣ry particular, commeth on more roundly, as followeth: Do∣ctor Morton himselfe (saith he) shall plead in our behalfe, who saith that the Manichees did heretically celebrate the Eucharist onely in one kind, in an opinion that wine was not created by God, but by some evill spirit, and were therefore anciently condemned for Heretiques: but the Romanists are not to bee accused of this here∣sie of the Manichees, in their not distributing of both elements of bread and wine. And to object this against that Church were an accusation injurious, for it was not the Manichees abstinence from wine, but their reason thereof which made them hereticall, said hee. So your Priest; yet what of all this? So clearely doth Doctor Morton (saith hee) cleare us from the foule and false im∣putation urged against us by Doctor Whitaker, who noted the Ad∣ministration but in one kind, now used by the Romish Church, to have had it's originall from the Manichees: and so clearely doth hee contradict both Master Whitaker and himselfe, in one place accusing us, in another excusing us, in one and the same Respect: of which foule fault of Contradiction in so great a Rabbin when he cleareth himselfe, instead of being Bishop of Litchfield, hee shall bee unto mee ever Magnus Apollo. Thus farre Master Brerely. Alas! what will become of the Doctor, being as you see, thus fiercely assaulted by two at once, one a Iesuite, the other a Ro∣mish Priest, both conspiring together to make the Doctor ridi∣culous? CHALLENGE, IT is now about twenty yeeres since the sayd Doctor (in Confutation of a booke of Master Brerelyes, intituled an A∣pologie) published a Treatise, called the Protestants Appeale, wherein were discovered many hundred of Master Brerelyes Ignorances, Falsities, and Absurdities: who ever since hath had Master Parson's itch, (as hee himselfe called his owne hu∣mour) which received a Salve that might have cured him of that itch, to bee medling with the same Doctor. Yet the only Exception, which hath since come to this Doctor's eares from
your side, is this now objected point, concerning the Mani∣chees: whereupon you have heard them both so urgently, and boastingly insist: and not so onely, but they have also divulged this pretended Contradiction in many Counties of this King∣dome, to his reproach. Will you be so kinde, as but to heare an Answer, and then either wonder at, or hisse, or applaude, or him, or them, as you shall find just Cause. Two things there were condemnable in the Manichees, one was their Act and Practice, in dismembring the Sacrament, by not communicating in Both kinds: the other was their Opi∣nion, which they held, for so doing; which was, as you have heard, an Hereticall Conceit, that Wine was the Creature of the Devill. Concerning this Hereticall opinion, no Protestant (sayd Protestants Ap∣peale lib. 2. chap. 4. Sect. 3. Doctor Morton) doth charge the Church of Rome: but as for the Act of not Communicating in Both kinds,In the same Ap∣peale, lib. 4. chap. 22. Sect. 10. he called it Sacrilegious, and concluded the Church of Rome, in this respect, to bee as guilty of dismembring the Sacrament, as were the Ma∣nichees. And both these hee hath done by the Authority of PopeComperimus quòd quidam, sump∣tâ tantummodò cor∣poris sacri portione, à Calice sacri cruoris abstineante qui pro∣culdubiò (quoniam nescio qua superstici∣one docentur astrin∣gi) aut Sacramenta integra percipiant, aut ab integris arce∣antur, quià divisio unius ejusdem{que} my∣sterij sine grandi sa∣crilegio non potest provenire. Gelasa∣pud Gratian, de Con∣secrat. cap. Comper∣mus. D. 2. Gelasius, who decreed, in condemning the Manichees, First against their Opinion, saying, Illi nescio quâ superstitione docentur astringi, &c. (That is) They are intangled in a kinde of Superstition. Then, for the Act of refusing the Cup, Because (saith hee) the diving of the same Mystery cannot be done with∣out grievous sacrilege, therefore let these Manichees either re∣ceive the whole Sacrament, or else let them be wholly excluded from receiving. So Gelasius, Seeing then Doctor Morton, and all Protestants, cleare the Church of Rome from the imputation of the Heresie of the Ma∣nichees, in respect of their opinion, and yet condemne them of the Manichean Sacrilege, in respect of the Act of dismem∣bring the Sacrament; with what spectacles (thinke you) did your Priest and Iesuite reade that. Answere of Doctor Mor∣ton, to collect from thence, either your Churches Iusti∣fication from a foule fault of Sacrilege, or else the Doctors foule Contradiction to himselfe, and that clearely forsooth, in the same respect? who themselves are now found to have beene so subtilly witlesse, as not to discerne Heresie from Sacrilege; an opinion from a fact; or a no-imputation of that, whereof neither Doctor Whitaker, nor any other Protestant ever accused them, from a practice condemned by a Roman Pope him∣selfe. Take unto you a Similitude. A man being apprehended in the company of Traytors, upon suspicion of Fellony, is fully and effectually prosecuted for Fellony onely; if one should say of him, that he was not convicted or condemned of Treason, but of Fellony, were this either a Contradiction in the party spea∣king, or a full Iustification of the party spoken of? You are by this time (wee thinke) ashamed of your Proctors, and of their scornefull insultation upon the Doctor, in the ri∣diculous
tearmes of Rabbin, and Magnus Apollo: who willingly forbeareth, upon this Advantage, to recompence them with like scurrility, being desirous to be onely Great in that, which is called Magna est Veritas, & praevalet. By which Truth also is fully discovered the vanity of the An∣swer both of Mr. Fisher, & of your Cardinall, saying, that Gelasi∣us condemned only the Opinion of the Manichees; which is so trans∣parant a falshood, as any one that hath but a glympse of Reason may see throught it, by the sentence it selfe, as hath been proved. Our second Reason is in respect of the perfect Spirituall Refection, represented by this Sacrament. SECT. VIII. ANother Object, represented in this Sacrament, is the food of mans soule, in his faithfull receiving of the Bodie and Blood of Christ, which because it is a perfect spirituall Refection, Christ would have it to be expressed both in Eating and Drink∣ing, wherein consisteth the perfection of man's bodily suste∣nance: and therefore are both necessarily to be used, by law of Analogie betweene the outward Signe, and the thing Signified thereby.

Caechis. Rom. part. 2. de Euch. num. 29. This Sacrament was instituted so, that two severall Consecrations should be used, one of Bread, and the other of the Cup; to the end, both that the Passion of Christ might be repre∣sented, wherein his Blood was separated from his Body: and because this Sacrament is ordained to nourish man's soule, it was therefore to be done by Eating and Drinking; in both which the perfect nourish∣ment of mans naturall life doth consist. Aquinas, and your Iesuite Valentia, with others, are as expresse in this point, as they were in the former; who although they (as we also) hold that whole Christ is received in either kinde, (for Christ is not divided) yet do theyHoc Sacramentum ordinatur ad spiritualem refectionem, quae conformatur corporali.

Christ saith, that by the onely act of Faith both hunger and thirst is taken away: therefore wee are said both to eat and drinke by the same and onely act of Faith. Wherefore you, in with-holding the Cup from the People, do violate the Testament of Christ, who requireth in this a perfect representation visible of a compleate and a full Refection spiri∣tuall; which is sufficient to condemne your Abuse, whereby you also defraud God's people of their Dimensum, ordai∣ned by Christ for their use. Concerning this second,Answer to his Majestie.

A greater augmentation of Grace is obtained by Communicating in Both. Which was the Cause (saith your Iesuite) that Hee dispenced with the King of England to participate in Both. For con∣sider (we pray you) that the Assistance of Christ doth especially concurre with his owne Ordinance, and therefore much rather where the forme of a Sacrament, ordained and instituted by himselfe, is observed, then where it is (as of you) so notoriously perverted, and contemned. Yet because you may think we rest upon either our owne, or yet of other your Doctors Iudgement
in this Defence, we shall produce to this purpose, the consona Doctrine of ancient Fathers. Our third proofe is taken from the manifold Reasons of ancient Fathers, for Confirmation of the Necessity of the Communicating in Both kinds. SECT. IX. FOr the proofe of the necessary use of Both kindes, in the so∣lemne and publike dispensation of this Sacrament, the parti∣cular Testimonies of many ancient Fathers might be produced, but your owne Authors will ease us of that labour, by relating andSatis comper∣tum est, universalem Christi Ecclesiam in hunc usque diem, Oc∣cidētalem autem seu Romanam mille am∣pliù à Christo annis, in solenn; prae fertim & ordinaria hujus Sacramenti dispensa∣tione, Vtramque pa∣nis & vini speci∣em omnibus Christi membris exhibuisse—atque ut ità facerent, inductos fuisse pri∣mò Instituto exem∣ploque Christi, qui hoc Sacramentum, corporis & sanguinis sui, duobus hisce pa∣nis & vini symbolis Discipulis suis, fide∣lium Communican∣tium personam re∣praesentantibus, pre∣buit: um quià in Sa∣cramento sanguinis peculrarem quādam virtutem & gratiam hoc vini symbolo sig¦nificatam esse crede∣bant: tùm ob ratio∣nes mysticas hujus Instituti, quae à veteribus variè adducuntur, viz. ad repraesentandam memoriam Passiois Christi in oblatione corporis, & sanguinis effusione, juxta illud Pauli, [Quoiescunque comederitis panem hunc, & Calicem Domini biberitis, mortem Dom annunciatis donec venerit] Item ad significandam integram o∣fectionem sive nutritionem, quae cibo & potu constat, quomodò Christus inquit, [Caro mea verus est cibus, et sanguis meus verus est potus.] Item ad designandam redemptionem & tuitionem corporis & animae; ut corpus pro salute corporis, & sanguis pro salute animae, quae in sanguine est, dari intelligatur.

That the ancient Fathers were induced to the Continu∣ance of the Custome in Both kindes, First, by the Example and Institution of Christ. Secondly, by some particular Grace, which they held to be signified by the Cup. Thirdly, for the Repre∣sentation, that it had to the Passion. of Christ; distinctly and respectively to his Body and Blood. Fourthly, to resemble the Redemption, which man hath in his Body by Christ's Body, and by his Blood in the soule.

Vpon this evidence may you justly call your fellow-Priest Mr. Brerely to account for his bold As∣sumption, saying, thatLiturg. Tract. 4. §. 9. pag. 425. a Eighthly.

And then you may furthermore question him for his next as lavish Assertion, affirming, in his fift An∣swer, that The Authorities objected, for the necessity of Both kinds, speake not of a Sacramentall, but onely of a spirituall Receiving with the mouth of their hearts. When shall we find conscionable dealing at this man's hands?

But wee are not bound to your Rules of blinde Obedience. God will have us to use the sight, which hee hath given us, lest If the blinde leade the blinde, both fall into the Ditch. And whether the Reasons, which are given by your Doctors, be not blinde Seduce∣ments, wee are now to try. Some of your Reasons are taken from extraordinary Cases, some Instances are common to all other Churches Christian, and some are made as being peculiar to the Church of Rome. The first kind of Romish Pretences, from extraordinary Cases. The first pretence is thus alleaged;Ob inopiam vini, cujus in pleris{que} Christianitatis parti∣bus magna penuria. Valent. ibid. & Sal∣meron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34. §. Ad quin∣tum, pag. 279. And Rossens. in like man∣ner. Bellar. also addeth another Reason to this: Movit Ecclesi∣am uniformitas, ut Concordia populi Christiani in Sacra∣mento hoc percipien∣do, quod est Sacra∣mentum pacis & unj∣tatis, propter eos, a∣pud quos vinum in∣veniri non potest: ut sunt, aliquae provin∣ciae boreales, ubi vi∣num non invenitur, qui existimarent se Christo curae non fu∣isse, aut non ità ut alias provincias, quandò Sacramentum instituit. Lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 28. Many Northerne Coun∣tries are destitute of Wine, and therfore one kind is to be used for Concord, and Vniformity-sake. Will you be answered from your selves?

Resolveth that Notwithstanding, Wheate and Wine may be transported easily to all parts. Accordingly doth he resolve of the want of Balsame, u∣sed in your Consecration, and yet it is farre more scarce than Wine or Wheate. Yet what Northerne Country almost can you name, that hath not abundance of Wine for many persons, e∣ven unto riot, and can they not as well have it in moderate mea∣sure, for a sacred Rite? But what talke you of Vniformity and Concord, in this Case of Alteration, (which are your two next Pretences) wherein not∣withstanding the Church of Rome is dissenting from the Greeke, and all other Christian Churches in the World? Or if this were a necessary Cause, why did not your Church allow the use of Both kindes to the Church of Bohemia, but twice raised a fierce warre against them? for which your IesuiteBis Princepes Germaniae ad Bohemos (quòd Communionem sub utra{que} specie communicarent) debellandos arma sumpcre, hortatore Cardinale Iuliano S.

Salmeron see∣meth
to be full sorry; marrie it was, because that warre had not his wished successe. Is their Concord in Hostility? Againe, be∣cause you (thirdly) pretend Vniformity also, why then do your consecrating Priests onely receive both kindes sacramentally, and all the other Priests in Communicating participate but in one? or how is it that you allow a privilege toSee a little af∣ter at (p.) Popes, Cardi∣nals, Monkes, and noble Personages, to receive in both kindes, and deny this liberty to Others? Is there likewise Vniformity in Disparity? Your fourth Pretence is, because divers areMulti sunt ab∣stemi, qui vinum non ferunt. Bellar. lib. 4. de Eucharist. cap. 28. Abstemious, and have an Antipathy against Wine, and some sickly persons also can hardly receive without Irreverent casting it up againe. If the particular reason, whichDicendum, quòd vinum modicè sump∣tum non potest mul∣tum aegrotanti noce∣re. Aquinas part. 3. quaest. 74. Art. 1. Aquinas giveth, saying, That Wine moderately taken of such can do no hurt, may not satis∣fie, yet this being also a Cause accidentall, and extraordinary, you ought to be regulated by this generall Rule, That extraor∣dinary Cases ought not to justle out ordinary Lawes and Customes. For, that Command of Christ to his Apostles, Go preach to every Creature, stood good in the generall, albeit many men happe∣ned to be deafe. Saint Peter requireth of every Christian of sit yeares, that he be prepared to give an answer of his faith to eve∣ry one that asketh; which precept was not therefore alterable, because of multitudes of many that were dumbe. Finally, to close up with you, he that by the rule of Hospitality is to cheere up his guests, doth not prescribe that, because some mens stomackes are queasie, and not able to endure Wine, or else some meates, therefore all others should be kept fasting from all meates and Drinkes: and the Eucharist (you know) is called by Saint Paul, The Supper of the Lord, and by ancient Fathers, an holySee above Chap. 2. Sect. 9. in the Chll. Banquet. The second kind of Romish Pretences is of Such, which might have beene common to other Churches. The other Causes above-mentioned were common to the primitive Church of Christ, wherein the use of Both kindes was (notwithstanding) preserved and continued; except that you will say, no Northerne Nations were Christians in those times: and that no stomackes of Christians were dis-affected to wine, in loathing it, &c. But two other Pretences you have, which you thinke to be of more speciall-force, to forbid the use of this Sacrament in Both kindes; One is Because (saith yourPrimò movet Ecclesiam consuetu∣do recepta, & appro∣bata consensu Gen∣tium & Populorum. Bellar. quo sup. Cardinall) such is the now-received and approved Custome of Nations and People. So he. But first to argue, that your Church did therefore forbid the use of both kindes, because she had approved the contrary Custome, is a meere Nugacitie
and Tautologie; and as much as to say, Shee would forbid it, because shee would forbid it. Secondly, saying, that the Vse of but One kinde had indefinitely the Consent of Nations and Peo∣ple, is a flat falsity, because (as hath beene confessed) The Greeke Church (not to mention AEthiopians, AEgyptians, Armenians, and Others) have alwayes held the Contrary Custome. Lastly, to justifie your Churches Innovation, in consenting to the humour of People of latter times, what can you censure it lesse than a grosse and absurd Indulgence? The other Motive, which theMover Eccle∣clesiam, & quidem vehementer Irreve∣rentia & profanatio∣nes tanti Sacramenti, quae vix evitari pos∣sent in tanta fideli∣um multitudine, si omnibus daretur sub utra{que} specie. Bellar. ibid. Cardinall calleth a Vehe∣ment presumption, and which all your Objectors most earnestly urge, is the Cause of Irreverence, lest the blood might be spilt, especially in such a multitude of faithfull Communicants: and also lest any particle of the Hoast fall to the ground, saith Master Liturg. tract. 4. §. 6. Brerely. We have but foure Answers to this mighty Objection. First, that this was not held a Reason to Christ, or his Apostles, or to the Church of Christ, for many ages, when notwithstanding the multitudes of Communicants were innumerable. Secondly, that The Casuall spilling of the Cup, saith yourVtriusque speciei usum illicitum esse at{que} sacrilegium ait∣falsum est, quòd usui Calicis annexum sic peccatum vel sacrile∣gium, propter pericu∣lum effusionis: nam si haberet adjunctum peccatum, neque Christus Dominus, neque Apostoli in primitiva Ecclesia, nec Orientales mo∣do, nec Occidentales ante Conc. Constan∣tiense, ne{que} deni{que} Sacerdotes celebran∣tes eo uterentur ritu. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 37. §. Deinde p 308. Salmeron, is no sinne, else would not Christ have instituted the use of the Cup: nor would the Apostles, or Primitive Church aswell in the West as in the East, in their communicating; nor yet the Priest in consecra∣ting, have used it. So he. We might adde, by the same reason should people be forbid the other part also, lest (as your Priest said) any particle thereof should fall to the ground. Furthermore, for the avoiding of Spilling, you (as your Cardinall AlanCernuntur hodiè ex antiquitate relictae quaedam fistulae ar∣genteae & aureae ve∣lut canales, calicibus vetustioribus adjun∣ctae, ut per eas sine effusione hauriri pos∣set sanguis è calice, quarum in Ordinario Rom. sit mentio.

Surely, there being no respect of persons with God (as said Saint Peter) we thinke that he, who will be Saint Peter's Successor should have taken out with Saint Peter that lesson of Christ, of loving the whole flocke of Christ, aswell Lambes as Sheepe; not to provide Pipes or Tunnels for himselfe alone, and his Grandes, for recei∣ving this part of the Sacrament, and to neglect all other Chri∣stians, albeit never so true members of Christ. For this wee all know, that1. Cor. 11. Ita{que} fratres mei, cum con∣veneritis, invicem expectate.] Dominus ex aequo Tibi & pauperi mensam proprij corporis, & poculum sangui∣nis tradidit. Teste Salmeron. les. Tom. 14. Disp. 19. pag. 153. Our Lord Christ prepared his table aswell for the poore as the Rich, according to the Apostles Doctrine, by your owne construction, answerable to the Doctrine of ancient Fathers. And that the Pretence of Reverence cannot be a suffi∣cient Reason of altering the ordinance of Christ, we may learne from ancient Histories, which evidently declare that the opini∣on of Reverence hath often beene the Damme and Nourse of manifold Superstitions.
As for example, The Heretikes calledSee §. 9. Discalceati, in pre∣tence of more humility, thought that they ought to goe bare-foote. TheSee above Sect. 8.

Euchari∣stia, Har. 6. Aquarij, in pretence of more sobriety, used water in this Sacrament. The Manichees wanted not their pre∣tence of not drinking wine in the Eucharist, because they thought it was created by an evill Spirit. And yet were these judged by Pope Gelasius to be Sacrilegious. {fleur-de-lys}Hence was it that your Iesuite demanded,Nic. Causin. Ies in his booke called the Holy Court. pag. 539. How was it possible (saith he) that the Heresie of Eutyches, being nousled under a false zeale of Reve∣rence towards the person of the Sonne of God, might not in∣snare the Empresse Pulcheria, a woman? Yea, and what greater defence had the Pharisees, for all their Superstitions, than that of Reverence? whom notwithstanding Christ did pierce thorow with so many Vae's, for annulling of the Precepts of God, by their Traditions, under the pretence of religious Reverence and sanctity. In briefe. It was the opinion of Reverence that made Saint Peter to contradict our Lords Command, when he said, Thou shalt never wash my feete: yet how dangerous it had beene for Peter to have persisted in opposition, the Reply of our Saviour doth declare: If I wash not thy feete (faith Christ) thou hast no part with me, &c. Vpon which Text SaintDiscamus Chri∣stum, prout vult, ve∣nerari, honorato nam{que} jucundissimus est honor, non quem nos putamus; nam & eum Petrus hono∣rare putabat, cùm sibi pedes eum lavare prohibuit: sed non erat honor, quem a∣gebac, sed contrarium Chrysost. Hom. 60. ad pop. Antioch. Tom. 1. Chrysostome rea∣deth unto you this Lecture. Let us therefore learne (saith he) to honour and reverence Christ, as he would, and not as wee thinke meete. And sure we are, that he would that same which he com∣manded, saying, [Do this.] Therefore our next Difference, be∣tweene our defence and yours, is no other than obedient Reve∣rence, and irreverent, or rather irreligious Disobedience. As for your Pretence of manifesting hereby aSi sic tanta esset degnitas Laico∣rum, circà sumptio∣nem corporis Chri∣sti, quanta Clerico∣rum? Gerson. Tract. de utra{que} specie. Greater dignity of Priests than of Laicks; it is too phantasticall for the sin∣gularity; too harsh for the noveltie; and too gracelesse for the impietie thereof: seeing that Christ, who gave his Body and Blood an equall price of Redemption for all sorts, would have the Sacrament of his Body and Blood equally administred to People, as to Priests; as you have heard the Fathers themselves pro∣fesse. The Third kinde of Romish Pretences, which are more pe∣culiar to their owne Church, in two points. First, becauseMovit Eccle∣siam, ad hunc usum stabiliendum & lege firmandum, quòd vi∣deret, ab Haereticis, et ex errore oppug∣nari.

Heretikes (saith Bellarmine, and meaning Pro∣testants) do not believe Concomitancie, that is to say, that the blood of Christ is received under the forme of bread: but for this Con∣comitancie the Church was moved to prescribe the use of the Eucha∣rist
in one kinde. So he. And this point of Concomitancse is that whichIn his booke de∣dicated to K. Iames. Master Fisher, andIn his Liturg. of the Masse pag. 396. Master Brerely most laboured for, or rather laboured upon. And albeit your RomaneMaximè om∣nium ad convellen∣dam eorum haeresin, qui negabant sub u∣tra{que} specie corpus Christi contineri. Catech. Rom. par. 2. c. 4. nu. 50. Ca∣techisme judgeth this the principall Cause of inducing your Church to preferre one kinde: yet wee (whom you call Here∣tikes) believe that the devout Communicant, receiving Christ spiritually by faith, is thereby possessed of whole Christ crucifi∣ed, in the inward act of the Soule: and only deny, that the Whole is received Sacramentally, in this outward act, under one onely part of this Sacrament, which is the present Question. And in this wee say no more than your Bishop Iansenius judg∣ed reasonable, who hath rightly argued, saying,Verùm non fa∣cilè apparet quomo∣dò apertè exterior il∣la sumptio dici possit bibitio: manducatio rectè dicitur, quià su∣mitur aliquid ibi per modum cibi: sed quo∣modò bibitio, cùm nihil sumatur per modum potus? non n. diceremus eum & manducare et bibere, qui panem tinctum vino sumeret, quam∣vis sumat quod fa∣mem tollat et sitim.

It doth not easily appeare how the outward receiving of Christ, under the forme of Bread, should he called Drinking, but onely Eating, being recei∣ved after the manner of meates, as that is called Drinking onely, which is received after the manner of drinke.

Therefore your Concomitancie (if wee respect the Sacramen∣tall manner of Receiving) is but a Chimaera, and as great a Sole∣cisme as to say, that the Body and Bones of Christ are drunke, and his Blood eaten: contrary to the Sacramentall representa∣tion, in receiving Bread and Wine, as hath beene proved. Next, when wee aske you, why onely your Church will not reforme and regulate her Custome, according to the Insti∣tution of Christ, and the long practice of the primitive Church? you answer plainly, and without Circumlocution, that the Rea∣son is, Lest that your Church might seeme to have erred in her alte∣ration if the ancient Custome.

What can more savour of an Hereticall and Antichristian spi∣rit, than this pretence doth? For an Heretike will not seeme to have erred, and Antichrist will professe himselfe one that cannot erre: which Character of not personall erring was ne∣ver assumed of any particular Church, excepting only the lat∣ter Church of Rome. Our Assumption. But the Church of Rome (which will seeme that shee cannot possibly erre, in her not administring the Cup unto Laickes) is knowne to have erred 600. yeares to∣gether in the abuse of the same Sacrament, by administring it (in an opinion of Necessity) unto Infants, as hath beene plenti∣fully See above Chap. 2. Sect. 11. witnessed by eminent Doctors in your owne Church. Hence therfore ariseth another difference; betweene the pro∣fession of our Custome and yours, which is, betweene Christ and Antichrist. All this while you do not perceive that your opinion of Concomitancie will ruinate the foundation of your Doctrine of Transubstantiation. But hereofIn the third Book. hereafter. The seventh Comparison is betweene the maner of Instituti∣on, and manner of Alteration thereof. SECT. XI. THe beginning of the Institution in Both kindes is knowne and acknowledged to have beene authorized by him, who is the  of the new Testament, even Christ our Lord, by whom it was established and published among all his Disci∣ples, at his last Supper.

It came not in by any precept, but crept in by little and little, by the abstinence of the people, and by the Tacite and silent con∣sent of the Bishops. So your Bishop Roffensis, and your Iesuite Costerus, and Fryer Castro. This confessed unknowne manner of Alteration of this your Custome, as it doth utterly refute your common Objection, viz. That every Doctrine and Custome must beejudged ancient and Catholike, the beginning whereof is not knowne; so doth it more especially put your Master Brerely to his blush, who durst make the same Objection in this very Case, in defence of the use of but One kinde, to proove it to have beene from the beginning, because No first knowne be∣ginning of our Catholike practice (Li∣turg Tract. 4. §. 9. at the ead thereof. saith he) can bee instanced.
And yet behold here no certaine beginning of this Romish Cu∣stome; yet notwithstanding confessed to be an Alteration, diffe∣rent from the Custome, which formerly for a thousand yeares was held a Catholike Custome. Was not the Church of Rome then a wise and a worthy Mistris of Churches, trow you; to suffer her selfe to be guided by the humour of People in a matter of this nature? what other diffe∣rence can this make betweene our Custome and yours, but that which is betweene divine Ordinance and popular negligence? or as betweene a publike Professor, and a Theevish Creeper? Heresie is certainly a disease, but wore you what? the2. Tim. 2. 15. Apostle noteth it to be a Cancer, or Gangrene, which is a disease Creeping by little and little, from joynt to joynt, untill it have eaten up the vitall parts; such a Cancer was this your Custome, if you shall stand to your owne former Confessions. Our last Comparison is betweene the Contrary Dispositions of Professors, one in continuing, and distinguishing; a second in mixing; the third in rejecting Both kindes. SECT. XII. THe comparison, betweene the divers Dispositions of Pro∣fessors, none will be more willing to shew than your Iesuite Quod verò at∣rinet ad tempora, tri∣plicem in coetu Chri∣stiano statum, Nico∣laus de Cusano Car∣dinalis expendit; fer∣ventis nimirùm, ca∣lidae, & frigentis.

Salmeron, who will have you, out of Cardinall Cusanus, to ob∣serve three States of the Church. The first is in her Fervencie; The second in her Warmnes; The third in her Coldnes. In the first state of her Fervencie, when the Christians affected Martyr∣dome for the Gospell of Christ, then did the People (saith he) com∣municate in both kindes. In the second state, which was in her Warmnes (though not so hot boyling as before) They then used to dip the Hoast into the Chalice, and so were made joyntly par∣takers of Both, in one. But in the third state of Coldnes, the peo∣ple were allowed the Sacrament only under one kinde. So he. CHALLENGE, IF now Truth may be judged by the different Dispositions of Professors, then may this former Confession witnes for us, that there is as much difference betweene the Primitive and the now Romish Custome, as there is betweene lively Fervencie, and senselesse Numnes and Coldnes, that is to say, Godly zeale,
and Godlesse Indevotion and Negligence: yet a Negligence not only approved (which is impious) but (that which is the height of Impiety) even applauded also by your Priests, among whom theVt nobis Iocu∣pletissii testes, at∣{que} omni exceptione majores retulerunt, in Germania qui eò loci per omnia obedi∣unt Romanis Ponti∣ficibus, non solùm (Reverendi Patres) Calicem vitae non cupiunt, aut petere audent, &c.

Accedit. above-said Gasper Cardillo in the Councell of Trent, with exultation told their Father-hoods (as being a matter of great joy) that they who are under the Iurisdiction of the Church of Rome, in Germany, dare not so much as desire the Cup of life. So hee. A GENERALL CHALLENGE, Concerning this last Transgression of Christ his Massè. SECT. XIII. IN this wee are to make an open discovery of the odious Vn∣charitablenesse, the intolerable Arrogancie, the vile Perju∣ry, the extreame Madnesse, and Folly, together with a note of plaine Blasphemie of your Romish Disputers, in Defence of this one Romane Custome of forbidding the Cup to faithfull Commu∣nicants. For what Vnaritablenesse can be more odious, than when they cannot but confesse, that there is more spirituall grace in the receiving of the Communion in Both kindes, do notwith∣standing boast, even in the open Councel of Trent, of some of their Professors, who, in obedience to the Church of Rome, do not onely (See the last te∣stimonie above. their owne words) not desire the Cup of life, but also dare not so much as desire it. Which Vaunt, wee thinke, besides the Impietie thereof, inferreth a note of prophane Tyranny. Secondly, when wee compare these Fathers of Trent, with the Fathers of most primitive Antiquity, they answer,Tertio loco ob∣jiciunt Ecclesiae sapi∣entiam, antiquita∣tem, atque potesta∣tem; atque potesta∣tem; aiunt enim, Ec∣clesiam primitivam, quae antiquior & sci∣entiâ at{que} vitae san∣ctitate praestantior erat, utraque specie usam fuisse: nostra igitur illam imitari debet, praesertim eum eandem atque illa habet potestatem in ejusmodi legibus positi∣vis sive abrogandis sive dispensandis. Respondemus, non esse dubium quin Ecclesia primitiva nostrae majore charitate, ac proindè uberiori sapientia praecelluerit, nihilominus tamen interdum contingit minùs sapientem in aliquo maliùs sapere, quâm alium absolute sapientiorem. Saepe etiam accidit, minùs perfectum hominem vitare aliquem errorem, quem melior non vitat. Salmcron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tractat. 38. §. Tertio loco. pag. 320. Al∣though the primitive Church (say they) did exceed our's in Zeale, Wisdome, and Charity, neverthelesse, it falleth out sometimes, that the wiser may in some things be lessè wise than another. Which an∣swer, if wee consider the many Reasons, which you have heard the Fathers give, for the use of Both kinds, and their consonant practice thereof, what is it but a vilifying of the authority of all
ancient Fathers? and indeed (as the saying is) To put upon them the Foole. The like answer two of their Iesuites made to the Practice of the Apostles, saying that your Church, having the same spirit, hath the same power to alter the Custome: whereas we have proved, that the ground which the Apostles lay, for their Custome, was the Institution of Christ. But that which the Ro∣mane Church allegeth, is meerely a Pretence of Plenitude of her owne Authority; It is impossible therefore that in so great a Contradiction there should be the same Spirit. And can there be a more intollerable Arrogancie than is this, which this Ro∣mane spirit bewrayeth in both these? Thirdly, upon the Consideration of this their Contempt of Apostolicall and primitive Antiquity, in this Cause, wee finde that your Romish Priests are to be condemned of manifest per∣jurie also; for in the Forme of Oath, for the profession of the Ro∣mish Faith, every Priest and Ecclesiasticke is swornForma Iura∣menti, per Bullam Pij quarti. Apostoli∣cas & Ecclesiasticas Traditiones admit∣to,—Ego spon∣deo, & juro, &c. To admit of all Apostolicall and Ecclesiasticall Traditions; as also to hold what theCaetera omnia à Concilio Tridenti∣no declarata & con∣firmata firmissimè te∣neo. Ibid. Romanam Ecclesiam Magistram esse Ecclesiarum cre∣do, &c. Councel of Trent hath decreed. But this Custome of administration of Both kindes, as hath been acknowledged, was an Apostolicall Custome, and from them also remained in an Ecclesiasticall profession and practice thorow-out a thousand yeares space; which your Church of Rome, notwithstanding, in her Councel of Trent, (whereunto likewise you are sworne) hath altered and perverted: which doth evidently involve your Priests, and Iesuites in a notorious and unavoydable Per∣jurie. Fourthly, As for the note of Foolishnesse, what more mad folly can there be seene in any, than to take upon them a serious Defence of a Custome, for satisfaction of all others, and yet to be so unsatisfied among themselves? so that both the Obje∣ctions urged by Protestants against that Abuse, are fortified, and also all your Reasons for it are refuted, either by the direct Te∣stimonies of your owne Doctors, or by the common Principles and Tenents of your Church, or else by the Absurdities of your Consequences issuing from your Reasons and Answers; divers of them being no lesse grosse, than was your objecting the An∣tiquity and Generality of the particular Romane Church, for lesse than three hundred yeeres, and to preferre it before the confes∣sed Vniversall primitive Custome of above the Compasse of a Thousand yeares continuance before the other. Fiftly, the last is the note of Blasphemy; for this name the contempt of Christ his last Will and Testament must needs de∣serve; and what greater contempt can there be, than contrary to Christ his [Do this] (concerning Both kinds) to professe that Sacrilegious dismembring of the holy Sacrament, which Gelasius the Pope himselfe had anciently condemned? or if this be not Blasphemous enough, then, supposing that Christ indeed had
commanded Consecration in Both kindes, upon divine right, yet notwithstanding to hold it very probable (as saith your Iesuit Licet Gabriel, & quidam alij senti∣unt divini juris esse, ut Sacerdos in utra{que} specie sacrificet, ni∣hilominùs tamen o∣pinantur authoritate Romani Pontificis fieri posse, ut in una tantum specie sacri∣ficet, viz. in conse∣cratione panis sine vino, quià putant multa esse juris divi∣ni, quae remittere & relaxare queat Pon∣tifex ob publicam a∣liquam & gravem necessitatem: ut vi∣demus votum, jus-j∣randum, Matrimo∣nium ratum, non consummatum, au∣thoritate Pontificis relaxari & dissolvi. Et ità in hac questio∣ne prima puto proba∣bilius & verius esse (ut dixi) juris esse divini, ut Sacerdos in duplici specie sacrifi∣cet. Et nihilominùs existimo valdè pro∣babile, authoritate Pontificiâ, ob publi∣cam & urgentem ne∣cessitatem, praedi∣ctum jus divinum re∣laxari posse. Sed quia nunquàm est rela∣xatum, ego consili∣um darem ut nun∣quàm relaxaretur. A∣zorius Iesuit. Tom. 1. Iustit. Moral. lib. 10. cap. 19. §. Tertium. pag. 857. Azorius) that the authority of the Pope may dispense therewith. But because Divine right was never yet dispensed with, I (saith hee) would give my Councel that it never may be. O Iesuite! thus to deale with Christ his Command. If hee or any other Ie∣suite had made as bold with the Pope{fleur-de-lys}Extravag. de verbo signific. Tit. 14. Cap. 4. Gossa. Do∣minum Deum no∣strum Papam. insituled in your pub∣like Glosse, OVR LORD GOD THE POPE) as this doth with Christ himselfe, saying unto him; Any of your decrees (holy Father) may be dispenced with by any Iesuite of our Societie: yet because no Iesuite hath taken upon him hitherto so much, my councell is that none of your Deerees be ever dispensed withall. The Pope, wee suppose, albeit he would thanke this man for his councell, for not Doing so; yet doubtlesse, would he reward him with a welcome into the office of his holy Inqui∣sition, for his judgement, to thinke it lawfull so to do: namely, to leave it to the discretion of every Iesuite, to dispense with his Papall Decrees. And notwithstanding the Iesuites [Suppose] wee may depose, that your Romish licence, for but One kinde, is a dispencing, or rather a despising of the Ordinance of Christ. {fleur-de-lys}And this the Iesuites themselves do thinke,See above in this Chapter, Sect. 3. in the Chal. 1. which may appeare in that Conclusion, which your Iesuite Vasquez gave concerning Christ Consecrating the Eucharist but in one kinde before his Disciples at Emmaus. Where he resolved, that This was an act of Christs Supreme authority, not imitable by the Church. And that the necessary Obligation of Consecrating in Both kindes is not dispensable by the Pope. So hee. Wherfore the Act of Christ being equally an Administration in only one kinde, and Both these equally done by the same Supreme Excellencie, and authority of Christ; the determination and Resolution must necessarily be this. That the Administra∣tion and Consecration in only One kinde are equally Indi∣spensable. We are already wearied with citing of the manifold, vilde, odious, and irreligious Positions of your Disputers and Pro∣ctors, for this your Cause; yet one Pretence more may not be pretermitted, least we might seeme to contemne the wit and zeale of your Iesuite Salmeron, against the use of this Sacrament in Both kindes. The use of Both kinds (saithDispensandus non est utrius{que} spe∣ciei usus Hereticis, quia non sunt danda sancta Canibus: nec Catholicis, quia debent distingui ab Haereticis, qui communicant sub duabus. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 37. 5. His potius. pag. 411. he) is not to bee allowed to Catholikes, because they must bee distinguished from Heretikes: nor to Heretikes, because holy things are not to bee given unto Dogges. Now blessed be God! that we are esteemed as Heretikes and Dogges, to be distinguished from them, in this
and other so many commanded Acts, wherein they have distin∣guished themselves from all Primitive Fathers, from the Apo∣stles of Christ, and from Christ himselfe. An Appeale unto the ancient Popes and Church of Rome, against the late Romish Popes and Church; in Confutation of their former Transgressions of Christ his Institution. SECT. XIV. THe ancient Popes and Church of Rome were (as all the world will say) in authority of Command, and in sincerity of judgement equall, and in integrity of life Superiour unto the latter Popes of Rome and Church therof; yet the ancient held it as a matter of Conscience for the Church, in all such Cases belonging to the Eucharist, to be conformable to the Precept and Example of Christ, and of the Apostles. So, you have heard,P. Calixtus. See above Chap. 2. Sect. 9. Pope Calixtus (Anno Christi, 218.) requiring all persons present at the Masse to Communicate. For which rea∣son it was (wee thinke) that PopeP. Greg. Ibid. at () Gregory (Anno 60.) commanded every one present at the Masse, and not purposing to Communicate, to Depart. There is an History related by AEneas Sylvius (after, Pope Pius the Second) which sheweth the reason why anotherSee above Chap 2. Sect 7. Chall. 6.

Iulius. See above Chap. 3. Sect. 3. Pope Iulius (Anno 336.) was much busied in repressing the Sopping of bread in the Chalice, and o∣ther like abuses of the Sacrament in his time: and the reason, which he gave, was this; Because (quoth he) these Customes are not agreeable to Evangelicall and Apostolicall Doctrine: and our Church of Rome doth the same. Where he addeth, concerning the manner of Communicating,Ibid. Wee reade (saith hee) that both the Bread and Cup were distinctly and severally delivered. As if he had meant, with the same breath, to have confuted your other Romish Transgression in distributing to the people the Sa∣crament, but in one of Both. And who can say but that Gregory and Leo, both Popes,See above Chap. 3. Sect. 5. observing the same use of Christ, had the same Resolution? Sure we are that PopeP. Gelasius. See above Chap. 3. Sect. 3. (r.) Gelasius (Anno 404) called the Abuse, in dismembring of this Sacrament, by re∣ceiving but in One kinde, A Grand Sacrilege.

But with what reason were they reprehended? Because (saith the Councell) that fashion is not found in the Sacred storie of the Evangelists. All those ancient Popes, who held the Example of Christ, in his In∣stitution and Apostolicall Customes, to be necessary Directions of Christ his Church in such points, concerning the ministration of this Sacrament, being so utterly repugnant to your now Ro∣mish Opinions and Practices; it must follow, that those former Popes being admitted for Iudges, whom all Christians acknow∣ledged to have beene Apostolicall in their Resolutions, the now Romish Church and her degenerate Profession must needs be judged Apostaticall. Now,20 30 40 from the former Actuall, we proceed to the Doctri∣nall points.

BEcause (asIn scripture ex∣plicandà haeresis est manifesta, sicut figu∣rata propriè accipere, ità quae sunt propriè dicta ad Tropicā lo∣cutionem detorquere: nam in verbis [Eu∣nuchi sunt qui se ca∣strāt propter regnum coelorum &c.] Aug. and to the same pur∣pose also, lib. 3. de Doctr.

of our Lord IESVS, even the Sacrament of his Body and Blood. In the which Disquisition, besides the Authority of Ancient Fathers, wee shall insist much upon the Ingenuity of your owne Romish Authours. And what Necessitie there is to enquire into the true sense of these words, will best appeare in the after-examination of the diversSee hereafter Booke, 3. 4. 5. 6.

The Issue then will be this, that if the words be certainly true, in a Proper and literall sense, then wee are to yeeld to you the whole Cause: But if it be necessarily Figura∣tive, then the ground of all these your Doctrines being but san∣dy, the whole Structure and Fabricke, which you erect there∣upon, must needs ruine and vanish. But yet know withall, that we do not so maintaine a Figurative sense of Christ his Speech, concerning his Body, as to exclude the Truth of his Body, or yet the truly-Receiving thereof, as the Third and Fourth Bookes following will declare. That a Figurative sense of Christ his speech [THIS IS MY BODY, &c.] is evinced out of the words themselves; from the Principles of the Romish Schooles. SECT. I. THere are three words, which may be unto us as three keyes to unlocke the questioned Sense of Christs words; wher∣of two are the Pronoune [THIS] and the Verbe [IS] not onely as they were then spoken by Christ himselfe, but also as they are now pronounced by the Minister of Christ. And the third key is the Pronoune [MY] whereof hereafter. Wee be∣gin with the word [THIS.] The State of the Question, about the word [THIS.] When wee shall fully understand by your Church (which Conc. Trident. Sess. 13. cap. 1. Verba illa à Christo com∣memorata, & à Divo Paulo repetita, pro∣priam significatio∣nem prae se ferunt. holdeth a Proper and literall Signification) what the Pronoune [THIS] doth demonstrate, then shall wee truly inferre an in∣fallible proofe of our figurative sense.

Tell you us, first, what you hold to be the opinion of Protestants? Lutherans and all Calvinists (saith yourLutherani & omnes Calvinistae pronomen [Hoc] propane positum esse dicunt, quià panem Christus in manu acceperat, & diit [Hoc est corpus meum.] Madon. Ies. in Matth. 26. §. Hc omnes.—Lutherus in verba Evangelistae. Habent hunc sensum; Hic panis est corpus meum. Iesuite) thinke that the Pronoune [THIS] pointeth out Bread. But your Romane Doctors are at oddes a∣mong themselves, and divided into two principall Opinions. Some of them referre the word [THIS] to Christ's Body, Some to a Third thing, which you call Individuum vagum. In the first place wee are to confute both these your Expositions; and after to confirme our owne. That the first Exposition of Romish Doctors, of great learning, (re∣ferring the word [THIS] properly to Christ his Body) perverteth the sense of Christ his Speech; by the Confessions of Romish Doctors.

And yet behold One, whose name alone hath obtained an Authority equivalent to almost all theirs, your CardinallArgumentum eorum, qui volunt Pronomen [Hoc] demonstrate corpus, est absurdum, quòd in hujusmodi propo∣sitionibus, quae signi∣ficant id quod tunc fit cum dicitur, Pro∣nomina demonstra∣tiva non demonstra∣re quod est, sed quod erit.

Pri∣mò, quià etsi Prono∣men demōstrativum demonstret rem fu∣turam, quandò nihil est praesens, quod de∣monstretur (ut in ex∣emplis allatis) tamen si quis digito aliquid ostendat, dum pro∣nomen essert, valde absurdum videtur di∣cere, pronomine illo non demōstrari rem praesentem. Atqui Dominus accepit pa∣nem, & illum porri∣gens, ait, [Accipite, Edite, H. E. C. M.] Videtur igitur demonstrasse panem. Neque obstat quod propositio non significat, nisi in fine totius prolationis: Nam etsi ità est de propositione, quae est ratio quaedam, tamen Demonstra∣tiva Pronomina mox indicant certum aliquid, etiam antequam sequantur caeterae voces. Et sane in illis verbis [Bibite ex hoc omnes] valdè durum est, non demonstrari id quod erat, sed id tantùm quod futurum erat. Secundò si Pronomen [Hoc] demonstrat solùm Corpus, verba speculativa erunt, non practica. Bellar lib. 1. de Euch cap. 11. §. Nota secundò. Bellarmine, who, speaking of the same opinion of referring the word [This] to the Body of Christ, doth in flat tearmes call it ABSVRD. But not without good and solid reason, and that according to the Principles of Ro∣mish Schooles; to wit, because before the last syllable of the last word [Meum] be pronounced, the Body of Christ is not yet present: and the word [This] cannot demonstrate a thing Ab∣sent, and therefore can it not bee sayd, This is my Body. {fleur-de-lys} With your Cardinall two other Iesuites take part, ingenuously confessing, thatVasquez in 3.

Interpretation needs be, {fleur-de-lys} else shew us, if you can, but the least semblance of Truth for that Opinion. Similitudes objected, for defence of their former Exposition, and confuted by their owne fellowes. The Similitudes which are urged, to illustrate your former Practicall and operative sense, are of these kinds; to wit, Even
as if one (sayBellar. See before at let. (k) They) in drawing a Line, or a Circle, should say in the making thereof, This is a Line, or this is a Circle: or as if the Smith (sayHaec locutio [Hoc est corpus me∣um] habet virtutem factivam conversio∣nis panis in Corpus Christi, ut a Tho∣mas.—Pro si∣mili, quod rudi in∣tellectui satisfacere valeat, dari potest, ut si Faber accepto ferro clavum subito motu formans, dicat, Hic est Clavus—Clavus non est cum profertur oratio, sed fieri inter proferendum, & esse per prolationem verborum.

But that these your Similitudes of making Circles, Lines, and Nayles, are no better than Iugling, and Gypsie-trickes of fast or loose, and fond devises forged in the braines of idle Sophisters, and uttered by your Circulary Priests, your owne Authours are ready to ma∣nifest: for in these Examples of the Painters touching a Line, or a Circle (as yourBellar. See before at the letter (k) Bellarmine sheweth) making and saying, This is a Circle; Is no true Proposition, untill the Circle be made. And then it is a figurative speech and not a proper, using the pre∣sent Tense, Is, for the future, Shall be. So he. In like manner your IesuiteProfectò prope∣sitio non est vera, ni∣si postquàm factus est Cuculus: Sed oratio accipitur pro verâ, quia id, quod futurum est, accipitur pro jam facto, per Tropum, non juxta Proprietatem fermo nis: in quem sen∣sum Christus plerun∣que praesens pro fu∣turo usurpavit: ut Matth 26.

Secunda.—Si [Est] propriè accipia∣tur, pro existere, du∣rum est ut uniat sub∣jectum cum praedica∣to pro futuro tempore, quia falsa esset propositio, non solùm in orationibus speculativis, & significativis, sed etiam in practicis & factivis: ut si quis volens facere Circulum, rogatus quid est Hoc? respondeatque, Hic est Circulus, Profesiò propositio non est statim vera, &c. Salmer. Ibid. pag. 83. Salmeron affirmeth with a PROFECTÒ and full asseveration, that the speech of him, who, in drawing a Cir∣cle, doth say, This is a Circle, cannot without a Trope or Figure, be judged true. So he. And furthermore, who knoweth not that every Operative speech doth signifie not the Being of a thing; but the Making therof, and bringing of it unto being? For although the Pain∣ter be so nimble, in drawing a Circle, that his hand may go be∣fore his tongue; yet when the Operative virtue consisteth not in working, by the agility of the hand, but in the orderly pro∣nouncing
of the words of a speech with the tongue, so that the Truth therof dependeth upon the utterance of the last syllable; it is impossible but the Priest, in uttering distinctly these words, [Hoc est corpus meum,] must say, This is, before he come to the last syllable of Meum: and consequently in his sense no∣tifie This to be Christ's Body, before (according to his owne judgement) the Body of Christ can have there any being at all. By this is discovered the notable Vertigo and dizzinesse of your Iesuite Maldonate; Hee, to prove that the Pronoune, This, doth relate to Christ's Body, standeth upon the like Ope∣rative speculation; God (saithQuum Deus ex limo terrae hominem finxit tectè verè{que} di∣cere potuiller, sump∣to in manus luno, Hic est Homo. Et cum ex costa mulie∣rem fabricavit, sump∣ta costâ dicere pota∣it, Haec est Mulier; quamvis cum pro∣nunciasset Pronomen [Haec] nondum fu∣isset mulier, ac signifi∣câsset cùm ita locutus fuisset, limum non esse hominem, & co∣stam mulierem; sed limum in hominem, costam in mulierem converti. Sic cùm Christus dicit, [Hoc est corpus meum,] significat panem mu∣cari in corpus suum. Quemadmodum si in Cana Galileae, cùm aquam in vinum, &c. Maldon. Iesuit. in Matth. 26. Ita cùm Christus dicit, accep∣to pane [Hoc est cor∣pus meum] quamvis illud corpus nondum ille esset, sed futurum erat, illud eo pronomine demonstrat, nee sig∣nificat panem, quem acceperat, esse corpus suum, sed mutari in corpus suum. Idem in Matth. 26. pag. 635. he) in creating man of the slime of the earth, might have truly said thereof, This is man: Or in framing Woman of the Rib of man, might have rightly said, This is Woman: or Christ in working his miracle in Cana of Galilee, might have said, (shewing the water) This is Wine. So he. When, notwithstanding, he is inforced in every one to alter the Verbe, Is, thus; Slime is changed into man: Rib is converted into Wo∣man: Water is made Wine, as he himselfe confesseth; expoun∣ding the words [This is my Body] thus, Not that it was then his Body (saith he) which as yet it was not, but was about to be: nor that he signified the Bread to be his Body, but to be changed into his Body. So he. As if any thing could be said properly to be that, which as yet it Is not. {fleur-de-lys} No, and therfore your Iesuite GordonGordonus Scotus Ies. Controvers. 4. cap 3. num. 15. [Hoc] demonstrat corpus futurum. And your Angles saith directly The Pronoune [THIS] demonstrateth the Body, which is about to be. As much as to say, This [Is] shal∣be. Another of your owne Divines will tell you thatSi [Hoc] demonstrat corpus sub ratione corporis, Propositio speculativa esset, non Practica. Ies. Angles flor. Theol. quaest. Art. 10. Concl. 4. Which was also the Argument of Bellarmine. See above at the letter (k.) If the Pronoune [THIS] demonstrate Christ's Body, then cannot the speech of Christ be practicall (that is) to effectuate that which it signifieth; and this will marre your doctrine of Transub∣stantiation quite. {fleur-de-lys} Hitherto of your first Interpretation. That the second Romish Exposition, referring the Pronoune [THIS] to demonstrate a Third thing, called Individuum vagum, or In∣determinate substance, perverteth the sense of Christ his speech [THIS IS MY BODY:] proved by the Confession of Romish Doctors. SECT. III. A Third thing, differing both from Bread and the Body of Christ, which Romish Sophisters have lately invented, is
that which they call Individuum vagum; by which is meant, a substance confusedly taken; as when one (to use your owne ex∣ample) having an Hearb in his hand shall say, This hearb groweth in my garden: in which speech the word, Hearb, which is de∣monstrated by the Pronoune, This, is not taken determinately, for that singular Hearb in his hand, (for that doth not now grow in his garden) but is taken vagè and confusedly, for the common Species, nature, or kind of that hearb. And this opi∣nion is defended bySententia haec est, Pronomine il∣lo designari aliquid commune Substantiae panis & corporis Christi; Commune (inquam) non se∣cundùm Rem, (illud enim nullum esse po∣test) sed secundùm rationem seu deno∣minationem, viz. sub ratione contenti, sub his accidentibus continetur corpus meum. Ita Guitmandus (where he reckons up 15 other School men:) ubi Pronomen [Hoc] substantive sumitur, & demonstrat in confuso Ens, sivè substantiam con∣tentam sub illis speciebus—ut cùm quis dicat, Haec herba nascitur in horto meo: illud Pronomen [Haec] non significat hanc numero herbam, sed herbam huic similem Suarez.

Illa quae dicuntur Individua vaga significationem habent vagam, & indeterminatam, sed suppositionem habent semper certam, & determi∣natam: nam etsi hoc Pronomen [Hic, haec, hoc,] quantum in se est, non magis significat hunc hominem, quàm illum, tamen cum ponitur in propositione (ut hic homo disputat) non potest accipi nisi determinatè pro hoc homine. Ergo necesse est ut illud Pronomen [Hoc] accipiatur determinatè, aut pro pane, aut pro corpore Christi—Nulla res potest esse nisi determinatè aut haec aut illa; Ergò non possunt haec Pronomina, si substantivè accipiantur, nisi pro hac vel illâ re determinata accipi. Maldmat. Ies. de Sacrament. Eucharist. Tom. 1. §. Tertius error. pag. 216. 217. Maldonate, as an Opinion both false and
full of Absurdities. {fleur-de-lys} With whom your Iesuite 3. Thom Disp 201. cap. 2.

Vasquez will take part; and your CardinallEt Cajetan O∣puse. Non hoc cor∣pus meum, est corpus meum: quia sic cor∣pus Christi converte∣retur in corpus Chri∣sti. Cajetan with him. {fleur-de-lys} 1. Because whensoever the Pronoune [This] is used in Speech, as, This man disputeth, it is alwayes in proper sense, as determinat∣ly taken. 2. Christ spoke of that which was in his hand, but that was no vagrant, but a singular determinate Substance. And it is grosse, to say a man holdeth a confused substance in his hand. Which seemed to yourMr. Harding in his answer to the 24. Article, saying, Learne you what they meane, and if their meaning bee naugh, handle you them as you list; you shall not offend us any whit. Master Harding so uncouth and fond an opinion, that hee utterly refuseth to defend the Au∣thours thereof. This, and much more have they written to the discove∣ring and discarding of this idle figment, wishing furthermore that the Defendants of this opinion, of Individuum vagum, may returne to their wits againe, and cease to offer such violence to this holy Scripture [This is my Body.] So they. And worthi∣ly, for these two words, Individuum, and Vagum, spoken of HOC, bee termes as Contradictory, as to call the same thing, singular-common, or determinate-confused. As for example, Quidam home, A certaine man, is in Logike Individuum vagum; as when Christ sayd, A certaine man went from Hierusalem to Hieriche, &c. None of the Disciples hearing this, could there∣upon point him out, saying; This man: or know thereby who, or what he was. Wee, for further manifestation of your Absurdity in this point, will instance in your owne Example, for your Indivi∣duum vagum, of the Herbe, which a man holdeth in his hand, saying, This hearbe groweth in my Garden, how can you say it is true in the proper sense? for if you take it determinately, the same Hearb numero is not in the man's garden, because it is in his hand, and so it is yet Hoc Individuum determinatum. And if you speake of it in a confused Notion, no Abstract Notion can be held in a man's hand, it being the function of the braine, and not of the hand, to apprehend mentall Notions, or Gene∣ralls; and so it is not Individuum at all. But the Text saith of Christ his hand, [He tooke bread, &c.] THIS, which Christ, in so saying, pointed out with his finger, saith your[Ho est corpus meum.] Hoc quod Christus digito de∣monstrabat, cùm illa verba protulit. Sand. de visibil. Monarch. lib. 7. ad Ann. 1547. Sanders; but a man will have much adoe to point out an Individuum vagum (such as is an invisible, or a confused No∣tion) with a visible finger. Wee would now conclude in the words of a Parisian Doctor,Petrus Piche∣rellus de Missâ. cap 3. Individui vagi commentum Au∣thori Scoto  relinquo; but that something els is to bee added. Another may be your Cardinall his owne Assertion, which he once made as a snare to catch himselfe in; for in yourCùm ante Consecrationem dicimus in Liturgiâ [suscipe sancte Pater hanc immaculatam hostiam] certè Pronomen [Hanc] demonstrat ad sensus id quod tunc manibus enemus, id autem est panis. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missâ c. 27. §. Prima proposito. Ro∣mish Masse, the Priest having the Hoast in his hand, prayeth
thus; Receive, holy father, this immaculate Hoast. If you shall aske him what, in this prayer, the Pronoune: This doth demon∣strate, hee telleth you readily and asseverantly saying; Certain∣ly it demonstrateth unto sense that which the Priest hath in his hand, which is Bread. So he. Now why there should not bee the like certainty of Relation of the Pronounce [This] to Bread in the speech of Christ, as it hath in the prayer of the Priest, none of you (wee thinke) shall ever be able to shew. Lastly, wee challenge you to shew, within the space of a Thousand three hundreth yeeres after Christ, out of all the An∣cient Fathers, any one Testimony that ever affirmed the Pro∣noune [Hoc, This] to betoken any Individuum vagum, or Com∣mon Substance; orels to confesse that this your doctrine is new, extravagant, and Adulterate. Nor yet can the Defenders ther∣of say that this is all one, as to say, This, that is, that which is contained under the forme of Bread, because this is like as when one shewing his purse, shall say, This is money, meaning that which is in his purse; which is a knowne figure Metonymia. Yet were it granted that [Hoc] betokened an Individuum vagum, as (to use your owne Similitude) when one saith of an herb in his hand, This herb groweth in my garden; so Christ should have sayd of bread in his hand; This (that is the like kind of bread) is my Body: yet would not this make the Speech of Christ proper, or not figurative, because Christ's Body could no more be properly predicated of the kind of wheat-Bread; than it could bee of that bread of wheate then in his hand, as Christ himselfe hath taught us, and as we are to prove unto you. For speaking of his Body, he calleth it  the grane of wheat, Iohn 12. 24. not This grane; yet Christ's flesh is equally called improperly The grane, as This grane of wheate: whereof the ancient Father Theodoret will reade you all a Lesson, in the sixt Section following. And now this so open and extreme civill warre among your selves, in confuting your owne Expositions, will further and confirme peace among us in that one Expositi∣on, which we are in the next place to defend, as followeth. The third Proposition, which is (according to the judgement of Protestants) that there is a Tropicall and unproper sense, in the Pronoune [THIS.] WEe reason first Hypothetically; If the Pronoune This demonstrate Bread, then the words of Christ are neces∣sarily to bee taken improperly and figuratively. But the Pro∣noune This doth demonstrate Bread. Our Conclusion will be; Therefore the words of Christ, necessarily, are to be taken figu∣ratively. All this will be proved, confirmed, and avouched by Reasons, Authorities, and Confessions, which will admit no
Contradiction. We begin at our proofe of the Consequence of the Proposition. That it is impossible for Bread to be called the Body of Christ; or Wine his Blood, without a Figure. SECT. IV. THe common Dictate of naturall Reason, imprinted by God in man's heart, is a Maxime, and hath in it an univer∣sall Verity, which neither man nor Divell can gain-say, and is Confessed by your selves, viz. Disparatum de disparato non pro∣priè praedicatur; That is, nothing can be properly and literally affirmed joyntly of another thing, which is of a different nature, viz. It is impossible to say properly that an Egge is a Stone or (to take your owneDisparatum de disparato non paedicatur, valet igi∣tur argumentum Si oc est lac, non est terrum: ita etiam valebit, Si hoc est corpus non est panis; cum repugnet, uam nturam de altrâ diversâ dici, ut homi∣nem eise equum, ci∣tra tropum, vel Me∣taphoram. Salm Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 16. §. Primum igitur p. 109. examples) wee cannot call A man an horse, without a Trope or figure, because their natures are repugnant. So Salmeron. And this he holdeth necessary. Or thus:Ne ipse qui∣dem Deus, qui est summa veritas, un∣quam efficiet, ut hae propositiones, uxor Lot est Sal, aqua est vinum, asinus est ho∣mo, in sensu compo∣sito sint verae. Ar∣chiep. Caesar. defens. fid. de Real. Praes. cap 58. God, who is perfect Truth, will never make those Propositions to bee true at the same time, viz, that the Wife of Lot is Salt, or Water is Wine, or an Asse a man. So your Archbishop. Yea, to come nea∣rer to the point:Observandum; cum dicitur vinum est sanguis, docetur esse sanguinem per similitudinem, reipsâ autem & propriè est vinum. Et cum dicitur sanguis est vinum, intelli∣gitur vinum ese pr similitudinem: nec enim reipsâ aut propriè esse potest aut vinum sanguis, aut sanguis vi∣num, cum res sunt ipsae diversae inter se, & termini ut vocant disparati. Beld. 2. de Euch. c. 9. §. Observand. Wee cannot say that this wine is blood, or that this blood is wine, but by a Similitude or Representation, because they differ in nature. So Bellarmine; adding furthermore that it isNon potest fieri ut vera sit Propositio, in qua subjectum supponitur pro pane, praedicatum pro corpore Christi: Panis enim & corpus res diversissimae sunt. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. c. 19. §. Primum. Impossible the Proposition should be true, wherein the Sub∣ject is Bread, and the Predicate is taken for the Body of Christ. And, Bread and Christs Body (saith yourEodem tem∣pore panis triticeus, & corpus Christi esse non possunt, quià disprata sunt. Sand. de visib Monarch. ad An∣num. 1549. [To object De Christo  Deus est homo, were vaine, because that is spoken by reason of the Hypostaticall Vnion, whereby ccidit Deo ut sit homo, per hypostaticam unionem, non per mutationem, which Vnity maketh God and man in Christ reciprocall. And wee also meane. Disparata absoluta, not Relata, for thus the same man is father and sonne.] Sanders) cannot be pro∣perly affirmed one of another. {fleur-de-lys}Also your IesuiteEstius Ies. Com in 1. Cor. 1. 14 Non intendit Christus his verbis [Hoc est corpus meum] affirmare panem quem tenebatin manu, esse corpus suum: quae affirmatio ab∣surda & manifestè falsa effet. Estius: To affirme Bread to be Christs bodie, is a Proposition false, and absurd. As false (saith your IesuiteIacob. Gordonus Scotus Ies. Controv. 4. cap 1. num 4. Non magis dici po∣test, Panis est corpus Christi, quàm aurum est plumbum, aut hic homo est bestra—non potest dispar tum de disparato verè & propriè dici, nisi quis velit contendere Christum verè & proprie dici Iudam, aut Deum Diabolum. Gordon) as to say Christ is Iudas, or God is the Devill. And indeed it is as impossible Bread should be properly a body of flesh, as a body of flesh to be Bread; which is grounded upon our first Maxime, which your Iesuite Salmeron expresseth thus. Quoties verbum [Est] res diversarum naturarum, quae à Latinis dicuntur disparata, unit & copulat, ibi necessariò ad figuram & Tropum recurramus. Salm. Ies. Tom 9. Tract 10 pag. 138. As often as the Verbe [EST, IS,] joyneth things of divers
natures together, we are necessarily to have recourse to a Trope and Figure. Will you be content that your Glosse, as the tongue of your Church, may have the last word? Then hearken to it: Si panis est corpus Christi, ergo aliquid quod non est natum ex virgine est corpus Christi: & ità animatum est inani∣matum. Gloss Decret. de Consecrat. dist.  can. Quia. If Bread be Christs body, then something is Christs body, which is not borne of the Virgin Mary; and then also the same body must be sayd to be living, and not living, both at once. So your Glosse, confessing hereby an Impossibilitie of this Predication, Bread is Christs Body, in a proper and literall sense. Our Proposition then standeth firme and infallible; our Assumption will be found as true. That the Pronoune [THIS] doth as verily notifie Bread, in the words of Christ, as if hee had expressely said, This Bread is my Body; proved first by Scripture. SECT. V. THe Text of the Evangelist Luke 22. is light sufficient in it selfe; [Iesus tooke bread, blessed it, brake it, and gave it to them, saying, Take, Eate, THIS, (namely) which they Tooke, and they tooke THIS, which he Gave; and he gave THIS, which hee Brake; and he brake THIS, which hee blessed; and blessed THIS, which hee himselfe Tooke; and THIS, which he tooke, was Bread, [Iesus tooke Bread.] We appeale to your owne Consciences, who never hitherto could say, that in all these Sayings of Christ there was made any Change or alte∣ration of THIS which hee tooke, till the last word pronoun∣ced by the Priest, which is [Meum;] nor yet can you deny, but that hee tooke that, which was properly, and substantially Bread. At the writing of this Sorites, we light upon an Answer from one MasterM. Malloune. in his late Reply. pag. 200. His Sorites; That which the Go∣vernour of the feast in Cana of Galile tasted, was the same which the Ministers brought him: that which they brought him was the same that others drew out: that which others drew out, was the same which others before them powred into the Pots; but that which others powred into the Pots was water. Therefore that which the Governour of the feast tasted was water. So he. [None is so witlesse but will easily, from the light of the Text, tell him, that the water was changed into wine, before the Governour of the feast tasted thereof: whereas, in the tenure of Christ his speech, you your selves could never point out any former change at all, before the last syllable, Me-um.] Malloune, encountring it with another, but a false Sorites, invented by himselfe, to the discountenancing of this true one; onely we intreat you, that at the reading therof, you will not laugh at his foolery. (See the Margin.) Your Grammaticall Objection is Childish. CardinallSi [Hoc] ac∣cipitur substantivè, tum sensus erit [Hoc] i. e. Haec res: quod si de Pane dicatur, absurdissima propositio erit, non enim potest dici Hoc de Re quae cernitur, & apertè cognoscitur, nisi sit generis neutrius illa—Nemo enim demonstrans de Patre suo, diceret, Hoc est Pater meus.

Schoole-fellowAlthough the word Bread had not beene expressed, yet being present in Christs hand, and pointed unto, Hoc could not bee taken substatively no more then one should say of his Father, Hoc est Pater meus M. Brerelye's Liturgy, pag. 137. Master Brerely, as if they would put Pro∣testants to Schoole, tell them that [Hoc] taken for a Substan∣tive neuter cannot agree with Panis, it being a Thing then seene and knowne, and not being of the neuter gender: no more than for a man to say, De Patre, Hoc est Pater meus. A strange thing, that great Clerkes, when they take upon them to teach others their Grammer, should be so farre overtaken, as to need to bee put in mind of theirAccedence, Quià per hanc acceditur ad Grammaticam. Accedence, (if ever they learned it) which telleth them that The neuter gender, substantively taken, will agree with any thing that hath no life, whether seene or not seene. In which respect there might bee a difference betweene, Hoc de Patre, and Hoc de Pane. For although Priscian would cry out, if he heard one saying, Hoc lana, or Hoc lapis, wherein [Hoc] is taken Adjectively: yet if a Question being raised, concerning the lightnesse and heavinesse of Wool, and of Stone, one shew∣ing the Wool in his hand should say, Hoc est leve; the other pointing at the Stone, should say, Hoc est grave, would any thinke that Priscian would be offended? for [Hoc] in Latine, neutrally taken, more than others would be for  in Exod. 8. 19.  1. pet. 2. 19.

Hoc est os, Gen. 2. what Insobriety then is this in your Disputers, so eagerly to reach that blow unto the Protestants, wherewith they must as necessarily buffet their owne Mother Church, by which the same Translation is made Authentike; and wound their owne Consciences, being them∣selves bound by Oath to defend it in all their disputations? Away then with these Puerilities, especially now, being bused in a matter of so great importance, wherein consisteth the founda∣tion of all the maine Controversies, concerning the Romane Masse. For, if the Pronoune [This] have Relation to Bread, there needs no further Dispute about the figurative sense of Christ's speech. {fleur-de-lys} Notwithstanding, Wee have not yet done, but further∣more to put every one of you to his Grammer. Wee have heard of a Romish Priest, who, having many unconsecrated Hoasts before him, used this forme of Consecration: Haec sunt Corpora mea: These are my Bodies. Which Report your See afterwards Book. 7. Chap. 5. Sect. 2. Author, indifferently, thinketh might have beene either true, or fabulous: however, it justly occasioneth us to make this serious demand, to wit, when any of your Priests, ha∣ving before him on the Altar not one loafe alone (as Christ had, which he blessed, saying, [This is my Body, and after brake it into parts, distributing them to his Disciples:) but many round hoasts, now to be consecrated; Wee aske, by what congruity he can pronounce of such a multitude of these Hoasts (which he meanes to consecrate) This is my Body? have you (ô the onely Grammarians!) any Grammer for this. We returne to the Schoole of Christ, the holy Scripture, to consult (about Christ's meaning) with his Disciple Saint Paul, where he professeth to deliver nothing, concerning Christ his Institution of this Sacrament, but that which he had1. Cor. 11. 23. Received of the Lord. Him we desire to expound unto us the words of Christ, delivered by Three Evangelists, and to tell what hee gave unto them, and what he called his Body: and he telleth us plainly, saying;1. Cor. 10. 16. The Bread, which wee breake, is it not the Com∣munion if the Body of Christ? alluding to those words of the Evangelists, He brake it, and that was Bread. And that you may know that this was Catholike Doctrine, in the dayes of Anti∣ty, wee adjoyne the next Proposition.
That it was Bread and Wine, which Christ called his Body and Blood; in the judgement of An∣cient Fathers. SECT. VI. FOr proofe hereof, behold a Torrent of AncientI.

Fathers pressing upon you; Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Hierome, Ambrose, Augustine, Cyril of Hierusalem, Cyril of Alexandria, Theodoret, Gaudentius, Cyprian, Clemens of Alexandria, and Isidore; Thirteene to the dozen, whose sayings wee may best know by their owne Idiome, and Tenure of speech. The first noting Christ to have confessed Bread to have beene his Body. The second, Christ to have called Bread his Body. The third, that Christ's speech was spoken of Bread. The fourth, that That which hee broke, was bread. The fift, that It was Bread which he brake. The sixt, that It was Bread of the Lord, and not Bread the Lord, received of Iudas. The seventh, that the words [My Body] were spoken of the Bread. The eighth, that Christ saith of the Bread [This is my Body.] And the same Father, as if he had stu∣died to take away all Scales of doubtfulnesse from the eyes of your mindes, illustrateth the matter thus: So (saith hee) did Christ call his Body Bread, as else where he calleth his flesh a Grane of Wheate; [Except the Grane of Wheate die, it bringeth forth no fruit.] The ninth, that Christ gave to the Bread the name of his Body. The tenth, that Christ said of the Consecrated Bread. This is my Body.] The eleventh, that It was Wine which he called his Blood. The twelfth, that He blessed Wine when he said drinke. And the last; The Bread strengthning man's Body was therefore called the Body of Christ. Yet need not this Father be reckoned for the Last, if wee affected to be supersluous. All these so Lear∣ned and Ancient Fathers (sufficient Grammarians wee trow) teaching the Pronoune [This] to demonstrate Bread, do as ab∣solutely confute your Romish Exposition, to prove the speech Figurative, s any Protestant in the world could do, if hee were permitted to plead his owne Cause. CHALLENGE. WEe will try what a Syllogisme will do, that, after your Po∣sall in Grammar, wee may encounter you with Logike.
The Major. No Bread can possibly be called a Body of flesh, with∣out a figure. (This Proposition hath had the Vniversall con∣sent of all Schooles, by virtue of that Maxime of Maximes, See above §. 4. Disparatum de Disparato, &c.) The Minor. But in these words, [This is my Body,] the Pro∣noune [This] doth demonstrate Bread. (This hath beene the generall Exposition of Fathers.) The Conclusion. Therefore the words of Christ, [This is my Body] are to be taken figuratively. Except you will contradict both the Generall confession of your owne Schooles, and Vni∣versall consent of Ancient Fathers; besides the now cleare light of the words of Christ. That it was Bread, which Christ called his Body, is proved manifestly from your owne Romish Positions and Principles. SECT. VII. YOur first Position is this; The word [This] must either point out Bread, or the Body of Christ, or that Third common Substance, which you call Individuum vagum. But to referre to word [This] unto the Body of Christ, is (as hath beene See above §. 2. confessed) Absurd. And that the word [This] should signifie your Individuum vagum, is an Exposition full of Absurdities, as hath beene alsoSee above §. 3. acknowledged. It remaineth therfore that the Pronoune [This] pointeth out precisely, Bread. A second Principle you have, to wit; That these words [This is my Body] are words of Consecration, and Operative, so that by [This] is meant that which is Consecrated, and (as your Coun∣cell Concil. Tri∣dent. Sess. 23. c. 4. Fit Conversio totius sub∣stantiae Panus in cor∣pus Christi. of Trent speaketh) changed into the Body of Christ. But, by the Decree of the same Councell, not the Body of Christ, nor a∣ny Third thing, but Bread only was then consecrated and changed into the Body of Christ. Ergo the Pronoune [THIS] hath only Relation to the Bread. {fleur-de-lys}We might adde, for a third Principle, the above inge∣nuous See above Chap. 1. Sect. 2. Confession of your Iesuites, granting that the Pro∣noune [THIS] in Christs words did designe That thing which was then present, whereof Christ sayd, [This is my Bo∣dy:] when as (which hath likewise beene confessed) That thing was neither Christs Body, nor any third thing differing from Bread. And therefore (say we) could betoken nothing but Bread. CHALLENGE. A New Syllogisme would bee had, to put the matter out of question. Major. No Sense, which is Impossible, can be given properly
to the words of Christ, [This is my Body,] (This needeth no proofe.) Minor. But to call Bread Christs Body, properly, is a Sense Im∣possible. (This hath beene your owne constantSee above § 4 profession.) Conclusion. Therefore cannot this Sense be given properly to the Body of Christ. How can you avoyd the necessity of this Consequence? All arising from the nature of Predication, in this Proposition, wherein the Subject is Bread; the Copula, Is; and Predicate, Body of Christ. Which because it cannot be properly predicated either of Bread determinate, as to say, This Bread in my hand is Christs Body; or of Bread undeterminate (which you cal vagum) as to say, This kind of Bread is the Body of Christ, it demonstratively sheweth that your Doctors can have no greater Adversaries, in this case, than their owne Conscien∣ces, which will appeare more fully in that which followeth. {fleur-de-lys}A Confirmation, that in the words [Hoc est Corpus Meum: This is my Body] the Pronoune [HOC, THIS] is ex∣pressely spoken of Bread; by the Analogie it hath with the other Pronoune [HOC, THIS] spoken of the Cup. SECT. VIII. AS all the motions of every wheele of a Watch have their activity from the spring; so may. We say that all the Controversies, touching the Romish Masse, in the Doctri∣nall parts thereof, concerning Corporall Presence, Transub∣stantiation, Vnion, and divine Adoration, attributed to that which is in the hands of the Priest, depend, as on their of-spring, upon the proper and Literall Sense of these words, [Hoc est corpus meum, This is my Body:] and this their Interpretation resteth upon the proper signification of the Pronoune [Hoc, This] as you have already heard. Which if it betoken Literally Bread, as all Protestants affirme, then by Vniversall consent, of even the Romish Doctors them∣selves, the speech of Christ must as necessarily bee a Fi∣gurative and Tropicall speech, as was that of Saint Paul, say∣ing, The Rocke was Christ. The Romish therfore, to avoid this, have devised other Interpretations of Christs words, as you have heard. Some (for they are divided among them∣selves) will have the Pronoune [Hoc, This] to betoken Christs Body, as if Christ had sayd, This my Body is my Body. The other Opinators holding the former to bee ab∣surd, say that by [Hoc, This] is meant not this definite Bread it selfe, but This (Individuum vagum) kinde of Bread is my Body; which hath beene condemned by their other parties (and truly) as an Exposition full of Absurdities.
Wee now pursue this point further, by examination of the Speech of Christ, concerning the other Element, de∣livered SaintMatth. 26. 27. Matthew and SaintMark. 14. Mark thus. He tooke the Cup, and gave it (the Cup) to them, saying, Drinke you all of this, (viz. Cup) For this (namely still, Cup) is my Blood. And is further proved to point out the Cup by SaintLuk. 22. Luke. and Saint1. Cor. 11. Paul, who both deliver it thus: This Cup is the new Testament, &c. But here in these words, [These Cup is, &c.] the Word, Cup, by Vniversall Consent is taken Tropically for the liquor in the Cup. Therefore did not Christ intend, in that which you call his Consecratorie Words, a Proper and Literall Sense; when otherwise it had been as easie to have said either (according to the first Exposition) [This Blood in the Cup, is my Blood:] or else answerably to your second Inter∣pretation, [This kinde of Wine in the Cup is my Blood:] albeit this also bee as Tropicall and Figurative, as to have said, [This Wine is my Blood.] Which your Church of Rome perceiued right well, and therefore, for avoyding the Trope and Figure, hath shee de∣vised a new forme, thus. [Hic est calix sanguinis mei: This is the Cup of my Blood,] different from all the Evange∣lists, even in that which you call a Forme of Consecration; as if in her high presumption shee had professed to correct the forme of Christ his Institution. A perfect Argument of a novell, naughtie, ruinous, and tottering Cause. If any Protestant had made so bold with Scripture, O what out∣cryes and vociferations should wee have heard! and that this was done to facilitate your Answer, where you say,Vasquez. in 3. Thom. Disp. 109. cap. 4. Ego existimo nullum esse Tropum in verbis essentiali∣bus formae. The Words or forme of Consecration Are without Tropes, your Iesuite Vasquez collecteth. Wherein notwithstanding hee forsaketh his Master Aquinas, even now when hee doth Glosse and Comment upon him; for sure it isAquin. part. 3. Quaest. 78. Artic. 3. ad 1. Dico, Hic est calix sanguinis mei, est locutio figurata: uno modo, est se∣cundùm Metonymi∣am, Continens pro Contento. d∣quinas concludeth most directly, saying of these Words, [This is the Cup in my Blood:] that It is a Figurative speech called Metonymia. Hitherto of the first Key of explication of Christs words.
CHAP. II. The Second Key in Christ's Words [Hoc est Corpus meum: This is my Body,] opening the Figu∣rative Sense thereof, is the Verbe [EST, IS.] FOr that [Est] in these words hath the same sense, as, Signifieth; as if Christ had sayd ex∣presly of the Bread, This signifieth my Body: and accordingly of the Wine, This signifieth my Blood, may be proved by three Proposi∣tions infringible. Our first Proposition. The Verbe [EST] being joyned with a thing that is a Signe, is alwayes figurative, and the very same with this word, SIG∣NIFIETH. SECT. I. FOr although the Verbe (Est) be indeed so absolutely simple, in it's owne nature, that it cannot be resolved into any other word (as all other Verbes may be in like Case) yet doth it (albe∣it accidentally) necessarily inferre a figurative Sense, and is as much as Signifieth, or Representeth, whensoever it joyneth the Signe and the Thing signified together. As for Example, A man pointing at a signe hanging before an Inne, and saying, This is Saint George, the Verbe Is can inferre no other Sense than Signifieth. Why? even because the thing, whereof it speaketh, is a Signe signifying Saint George. And Bread in this Sacrament is in all Catholike Divinity a Signe of Christs Body. Therefore the Verbe [Is] can have no other Sense than [Signifieth.] The former Proposition confirmed by all like Speeches, whether Artificiall, Politike, or Mysticall. SECT. II. YOur owne Iesuites, and common Experience it selfe will ve∣rifie this Truth. First, In things Artificiall, asMetonymia, tropus est in Scriptu∣ris frequentissimus, quâ continens pro contento, & contrà signatum pro signo usurpari solet; ut ostensâ imagine Herculis, dici∣mus, Hic est Hercules. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. proleg. 12. Can. 15. To say of the
Picture of Hercules, This is Hercules, is a figure. Secondly, In things Politike, as when aTestamentum saepè sumitur pro Le∣gato, seu Re testatâ. Bartrad. Ies Institut. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 5. Legacie, given by Will and Testament, is called the man's Will. So they. And indeed what is more Common, than for a man to say of his Testament, This is my Will? Of his name subscribed, This is my hand? And of the waxe sealed, This is my Seale? When as his Will (properly taken) is in his heart, his hand is affixed to his Arme, And his seale may be in his pocket. Thirdly, In Mysticall and Divine Rites; as in Sacrifice, even among the Heathen, according to that Example out of Homer, which is notable. The Greeas and Trojans, when they entred into a league, which was to be racti∣fied by a Sacrifice of Lambs, upon which both sides were to take their Oathes, this their Act is thus expressedSalm Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 15. §. Malè em. [Idem priùs habuit noster Bezin Luc. 22. 20.]— that is, They brought with them two Lambs, their faithfull oathes. Where Lambs, the rituall signes of their faith∣full Swearing, are called Oathes. An Example (I say) even a∣mong the Heathen, which is as apposite to our purpose, and op∣posite against your defence, as can be. Our Second Proposition, answerable to the first. All the like Sacramentall Speeches, in Scripture, are figuratively understood. SECT. III. IN all such like Sacramentall Speeches, both in the old and new Testament, wherein the Signe is coupled with the Thing signified, the Speech is ever unproper and Figurative, and the Verbe [Est] hath no other force than, Signifieth. This Truth is confirmed abundantly by the Testimonies of your owne Ie∣suites, and others, who come fraught with Examples. First, concerning the old Testament, Noting that the Sacrifice of thePascha signi∣ficat transitum, quà Angelus transivit do∣mos Israelitrum: haec ratio nominis redditur, cum dicitur, [Transibit enim Dominus um vide∣rit sanguinem in u∣troque poste.] ansen. Ipsc. Concord. in Matth. 26. [It was therefore more than boldnesse in Bellar∣mine, l.  de Euch. cap 11 §. Quaedam to say; Agnus erat proprè Transitus, Agnus being in the Prediament of Substance: and Transitus in the Predicament of Action. Paschall Lambe, being but a Signe, was called the Passe∣over, or passing-over. Secondly, that hoc  loco dicitur spiritualis, ex qua Deus eduxit per miculum aquam, quià Signum  è ltgre Christi  Sameron. Ies. in 1. Cor. 10 [Petra autem erat Christus.] Id est. Petra significab t Christum: ubi signum appellat nomine rei significatae. Peer. Ies. Com. in Dan 2. p. 85. [etra erat Christus.] Erat autem Christus Petra, certissima scilicet significatione. Arias Mont. in 1. Cor. 10. & Piata. Ies. ia Is 51. The Rocke, being but a Signe of Christ, was called Christ. {fleur-de-lys} Albeit your Doctor Heskins, long ago ventured to confute this Sense, saying, In his Parliament of Christ. B. 2. Chap. 3. Christ was the spirituall Rocke, not the materiall: and af∣terwards concluding thereupon, that it is no figurative speech in the Saying of Saint Paul. A Doctor-like Conclusion for∣sooth! which even Petits in Common learning would easi∣ly
confute by Retorsion, thus: If Christ was by the Apostle called the Spirituall Rocke, then was the figuratively called The Rock, as well as he was figuratively called Vine, and Doore; even because he was not a Vine, or Doore Materially, but Spiritually. {fleur-de-lys} Thirdly, thatCircumcisio soedus dtu, & signum toe∣deris. Bellar b. 1. de Ea 11 § Se. und. Circumcision, being but a Signe of the Covenant, was called the Covenant. So likewise in the new Testament, both concerningChristus cum Nicodemo spiritua∣lutè: intelligendus. Muddon. Ies. in cum locum. ob. 3. Baptisme, which in Christ his speech to Nicodemus (being but a Signe of Regenera∣tion) is called Regeneration. AndSep sumus Rom 6. 4. Id est, Christum sepultum represent  To∣let. Ies  em . Baptizing, which being a Signe of the Buriall of Christ) in the speech of Saint Paul, is called Buriall: and concerning the Eucharist, the Communi∣cants therof are called One Bread, Cor. 10 16. Finally, that the most proper Interpretation of the Verbe [Est, Is,] in such like speeches, importeth no more, than [Sig∣nificat,]your IesuiteQò verò in  is orationibus [Pe∣tra erat Christus; Semen erat verbum De, Ego sum Osti∣um] verbum substan∣tivum sit interpretan∣dum pro Significat, aut sigurat; non ei id accidit ex n tuâ suâ, aut per se, sed quoni∣am Pecta illa aiter cum Christo conjungi non potest, quam per sigum—Inde sit, ut parvi refer tsivè di∣cas, Petra erat signum Christi, vel significabat Christum Salmeron. Ies Tom 9. Tract. 16. §. Primum igiur. pag. 118. Salmeron will testifie for us: In these speeches (saith he) The seed is the Wond, I am the Doore, The Rocke was Christ; the Verbe [Is, and, WAS] must be interpreted for SIGNIFIETH, or figureth; not of it's owne nature, but because the word, Rocke, cannot be otherwise joyned with Christ, than by a fi∣gure or Signe. So he. Even as Master[Petra erat Christus] Soler ita expon, Petra significabat Christum, id non ità accidit quòd verbum [Ess] pro significat, ex se collcetur, sed quontam [Petra] illa alter cum Christo cohaerere, quam per fimiludinem, & signu on potest. Sund de Visib. Mona. ad Annum. 1550. pag. 141. Saders also is com∣pelled to confesse in a like Case. CHALLENGE. THus have wee argued from Induction and Enumeration of Texts of Scripture, in all like Sacramentall Speeches: which Exposition, by Analogy of Scriptures, was ever held of all Divines the most absolute and infallible manner of expoun∣ding the Scripture that can be. The Truth whereof ariseth es∣sentially out of the Definition of a Sacrament, which as well the whole Catholike Church, as your Romish, hath defined to bee a visible Signe. But no visible Signe can be joyned to any thing signified thereby, in like Predication, without a Figure, as hath beene both copiously proved and confessed.
Our third Proposition, viz. Eight Confessed Figures are apparently found in the words of Christ his Institution of this Sa∣crament. SECT. IV. THat the Pronoune, THIS, used aswell in these words of Christ [This is my Body] as in the other [This is my lood] inferre a figure,See the Sections ing before. hath beene proved to the full, and so will be acknowledged by your owne publikely authorized Romane See the Sect. 6. now following. Glosse it selfe: which may be sufficient to muzzle our Op∣posites, who please themselves in nick-naming Protestants, calling them Toutists, of the word, , which is the word, THIS; and Tropists, because of their professing the words of Christ to be Tropicall, and figurative. But how much more confounded must they needs be, when it shall confessedly ap∣peare, that there are Eight figures moe in the words of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament? Let us begin with the word, BROKEN, thus; [This is my Bo∣dy, which is Broken for you.] 1 Cor. 11 24. Say now, do you thinke indeed, and that seriously, Christ to have signified hereby that his Body in this Sacrament was therefore really Broken? Si propriè loqui velimus, falsae sunt istae Propositiones, Corpus Christi man∣dicatur à nobis, cor∣pus Christi teritur, corpus Christi devo∣ratur, corpus Christi frangitur: quia ipsi modi, qui significan∣tur his verbis, non conveniunt Corpori Christi. Maldor, de Sacrament. Tom. 1. pag. 144.

Aquinas your chiefe School∣man. See afterwards, Book. 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 2. in the Margin. Because the word, [Broken] properly taken signifieth a separation of the parts of that Body, which is said to be broken. But there is no separation, or discontinuation of the parts of Christs Body in this Sacrament. So they. To which purpose your Bi∣shop Iansenius. See hereafter. Book. . Chap. 1. Sect. 4. Iansenius will have us to observe a Reason wherefore the word [Broken] is left out of your Romane Missals (to wit) Lest that some should be so fond and seelie as to conceive that Christ's Body is truely Broken. And upon this Contemplation your Bishop of Winchester Stephen Gardiner is peremptorie. Stephen Gardiner in his Explication of the Sacrament of the Altar. If one aske (saith he) if the Body of Christ be broken, I have
learned to say, No, because that glorious Body cannot now be broken and divided, for it is whole in every part. What then (will some say) doth the word [Broken] signifie in the speech of Christ? and your Iesuite Salmeron is ready to instruct them out of the Fathers, thatSalm. ron. Ies. See afterwards, B. 6. Chap. . Sect. 2. It signifieth the crucifying of his Body with speare and nayles upon the Crosse. The like will be confessed of the Verbe, EATE, in those speeches of Christ, [Take, Eate] which being properly taken, (say the above-namedSee above in the Margin, at the ltter (a) Iesuites) would make the speech of Christ to be false: because, not the Body of Christ, but the Sa∣crament is properly Eaten. The Reason is expressed by your Iesuite Salmeron,Salmeron. See afterwards, Book. 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 2. Reall eating (saith he) requireth a reall touch and tearing of that which is eaten: but Christ's Body is not torne with the teeth, because this is Impartible. So he, Which is as plaine as can be, to prove the word, Eate, (as it is applied to Christ's Body) to be absolutely figurative. In like manner, in the words of Christ's Institution, Wee reade that he said, [DRINKE you all of this:] which you re∣ferre properly to Christ's Blood, albeit you holding Concomi∣tancie (asSee above, B. 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 8. Out of Iansenius and Du∣rand. you do) that is, that Christ's Blood is not separated out of his Body more in this Sacrament, than it is out of the Sa∣crament, but is still the same Body which hath its Blood in the veines thereof, therefore you cannot affirme truely that Christ's Blood is properly Drunke; Witnesse your great Pedagogue Mr. Brerely.Mr. Brereley. Lirg. Tractat. 4. §. 8. If we should attend to the propriety of speech, neither is his Blood properly drunke in the Chalice, but onely the forme of Wine, seeing the Blood hath the same manner of Existing as under the forme of Bread, (to wit) not divided nor separated from the Bo∣dy, but included in the veines, and then in the Body. Do you not heare? Christ's Blood is not properly drunke, if not properly, then figuratively; as figuratively, as if one, swallowing the Body of Christ, should be said to Drinke his Body. Wee aske Master Brerely, what then is that which is properly drunke out of the Chalice? and he saith, onely the forme of Wine, that is to say, a meere Accident. Hardly can it he said that a man properly drinketh the Ayre, which he breatheth, al∣though it be a substance: and are you brought to believe meere Formalities to be truely Potable? VVee passe to two other Figuratives, whereof wee reade, for the first part, [Take, this is my Body, which is Given for you:] and of the other, [This is the newe Testament in my Blood, which is Shed for you.] In both which words [GIVEN, and SHED,] as they are spoken in respect of the time, Wee ex∣pect from you a Confession of the figure Enallage, which is the using of the present tense for the future; your Iesuite[Corpus quod provobis datur] Id est, quod offeretur pro vobis in cruce mactatum. Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 3. §. Igitur. [Of the word, Eato, literally false, so your Iesuites. See Book. 5. Chap. 4. §. 2.] Va∣lentia testifying for the first, [Given] that is (saith he) which shall be offered upon the Crosse. And your Iesuite Salmeron for
the other [Blood which is Shed.]Graecus Textus [Effunditur.] Non est negandum mo∣rem esse Scripturae, ea dicere jam esse, quae futura sint, uhìc [ef∣funditur] quià paulò post in cruce essun∣dendus. Salmeron. Ies. in 1. Cor. 11. p. 154 & Sa. Ies. in Matth. 26. Graecè, Effundi∣tur: praesens pro fu∣turo. So Cajetan in Matth. 26 [Effundi∣tur] nempè tempore passionis; jam enim inceperat effundi. It is not denyed (saith he) but that it is the manner of Scripture to speake of a thing, as now done, which is after tobe done, as in this place, [Is shed] because shortly after, it was to bee shed upon the crosse. So likewise your Iesuite Sa. And that this is among you the true and Com∣mon exposition of these words of Christ, your BishopIansenius. See afterwards Book. 6. Chap. 1. §. 2. at (q) Ian∣senius doth not forbeare to testifie. So then, in both these words [Given, and Shed] there are two figures, in respect of the Time. Wee are furthermore to consider the Word, Shed; in re∣spect of the Act, wherof your owneSee Book. 6. Chap. 1. §. 4. for the three first: and Book. 4. Chap. 2. § 3. for the last. Doctors have thus determined. 1. your Bellarmine. Christs blood, at his Insti∣tution of this Sacrament, did not passe out of his Body. 2. your Alfonsus. Christs blood was never Shed after his Resurrection. 3. your Iesuite Coster. True effusion of blood is a separating it from the Body, which in Christ was onely on the Crosse. 4. you may adde to these the stiffe Resolution of your Iesuit Suarez Christs blood to be separated out of his Veines, who can beleeve? And if this bee not to bee beleeved, then to say that it is not Figura∣tively sayd to be Shed, is altogether as incredible. {fleur-de-lys} Will you be pleased that your Iesuite Vasquez may de∣termine this point throughout. HeVasquez Ies. in 3. Thom. Qu. 78. Art. 3. Disp. 199. cap. 1.

(Al∣leaging to this pur∣pose the consent of Cajetan, Theophy∣lact, Euthymius, An∣selm, and Chrysost.) Adding, Rationes verò pro hac nostra sententia & interpre∣tatione sunt (me Iu∣dice quidem) effica∣cissimae—paulò post, Non est effusio sanguiis in Eucha∣ristia, per modum Sacrificij, sed repraesentatio & sigura illius: in calice enim Domininon separatur sanguis à corpore Christi, ac proindè reipsa non effunditur. concludeth all these words, [Broken, Given, Shed] to relute to Christs Passion in a future sense: bringing with him Cajetan, Theophylact, Eu∣thymius, Anselm, and Chrysostome for his Authors: and will have you to know that hee hath most forcible Reasons for this Interpretation, besides this his owne, to wit, That the Blood of Christ cannot bee sayd to bee Shed, which is not properly se∣parated out of his Body in the Sacrament. Aquinas will speake as confidently of Breaking, thatSee above confessed. It is impossible it should bee broken, which is a dividing into many parts. Now further∣more concerning the same words, [Broken, Given, Shed,] in respect of the Time, as that they signifie the Future time of Christs Passion, youBooke 6. Chap. 1. §. 2.  shall have yet moe of your owne Do∣cotors averring as much, so that your Romish Suggester shall have little cause to complaine of the paucity of our wit∣nesses. {fleur-de-lys} It followeth in the words of Christs Institution, [This is the Cup of the new Testament in my blood.] Now what of this? hear∣ken to your Bishop Iansenius.[Hic. Calix est novum Testamentum.] Non potest accipi in proprio sensu, sed in eo, quem clarira verba Matthaei et Mrci indicant & exigunt. Sivè enim Calix suatur provasc potorio, sive Synechdochic pro sanguine in poculo con∣tento, non potest consistere ut in ijs verbis sit propria locutio—Nemo enim dix erit propriâ locutione vascu∣lum illud potorium fuisse novum Testamentum, cùm incertum sit an adhùc exstet illud poculum: at novum Te∣stamentum est aeternum Sed nec sanguis in calice contentus potest esse novum Testamentum propria locutione, quià lex Evangelica in Epist. ad Heb dicitur novum Testamentum, & apul Matth. & Marcum sanguis dicitur hov Testamenti. At unicm est num Testamentum. Ianse. Concord in  locum, pag. 910. These wordes (saith he) can∣not
not be taken properly, whether the [Cup] bee taken for the vessell, used for drinking, which was a temporall thing, and therfore could not bee the Testament of Christ, which is aeternall: or else whether you take it for the matter in the Cup (which is a Figure called Sy∣nechdoche) for it being the blood of the new Testament, could not bee properly the Testament it selfe. Yea, and your Iesuite Salmeron pointeth out in the same words, a double Figure;Subest in his duplex Metonymia, 1. quuà Coninns po∣nur pro Contento, id est, poculum, sive Calix, pro vino, eò quod vinum in ipso continetur. 2. est, cò quod contentum in poculo foedus, vel Testamentum dici∣tur novum, cùm sit ejus symbolum prop∣ter species.—Te∣stamentum hoc in loco potest sumi pro¦lege Evangelica, quae veteri legi opponitur, ut rem Testamento legatam testatamvè significet.

Id est haereditatis Salm. Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 15. § 3. p. 98. A double Figure (saith he) is here, the [Cup] being put for the thing con∣tained in the Cup: and [Testament] being taken for the Legacie that is granted and given by the Testament; wih whom the Testamentum sumitur pro legto Metonymiè, continens Testamentum sumitur pro contento legate, su haereditate, quae Testamento continetur. Barrad. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 5 pag. 79. Tom. 4. Iesuite Barradas doth consent. Hereunto may be added Christs Tropicall Saying in the 6. of Iohn, where Christ calling that, which he giveth to be eaten, his Flesh, in the same Chapter he calleth his Flesh, which is to bee eaten of the faithfull, Bread. Which none of your side durst hitherto interpret without a Figure. And yet againe, the Apostle speaking of the Mysticall body of Christ, which is his Church, assembled at the holy Communion, to participate of this Sacrament, saith of them;1. Cor. 10. 17. Wee being many are one bread and one Body: for wee are all partakers of that one Bread. But why? Even as one Bread consisteth of many cornes, so doth one Church of Christ of many faithfull persons, saith yourSicut unus panis ex multis grans, &c. Aquia. in cum locum. Aquinas. But none of you will deny, that the Apostles naming the Com∣munion of the Faithfull to bee one Bread, or Loafe, is altogether Figurative. CHALLENGE. COllect wee now the Parcels above-mentioned. First in the word [This] necessarily referred to Bread, inferring one Figure in the former Chapters: And next, in this Section, one Figure, in the word, Broken; Another in the word, Eate; A third in the word, Drinke; A fourth in the word, Given; A fift and sixt in the word, Shed: A seaventh in the word, Cup: An eighth in the word, Testament: nine in all, and then your Gybes and Tants, against our Figurative Exposition of Christs words, as so many bolts shot upwards, must fall directly upon your own pares. Of your Bellarmines Objection of the word, Shed, hereafter, in the sixt Booke, and 2. Chapter. {fleur-de-lys} It is no better than Hemlocke which you put into your Disciples mouthes, to stupifie them withall, when you reach them to stand to the Literall words of Christ, lest that o∣therwise Christs speech should bee accounted a Lie. First
against your owne knowledge, who are not ignorant, that Truth is not opposed to Figurative, but to False speech: else all the Parables of Christ, which are altogether Figura∣tive, should be called false; which were Blasphemie to af∣firme. And also against the acknowledgement, already spe∣cified, confessing that Bread cannot, in a proper and Literall sense, be truly called Christs Body. And the generall Rule is, that Truth in a Figurative sense cannot be so in a Literall; no more than a Literall Truth can be Figurative and Tro∣picall. {fleur-de-lys} That the Figurative sense of Christ's words is agreeable to the Iudgement of the more Ancient Church of Rome. SECT. V. YOur old and publike Romish Glosse saith plainly;Coeleste Sacra∣mentum, quod verè repraesentat Christi carnem, dicitur Cor∣pus Christi, sed im∣propriè: unde dicitur suo more, sed non re veritate, sed signifi∣cante mysterio: ut fit sensus, vocatur Corpus Christi, id est, significatur. Gloss. Decret. de Consecrat. Dist. 2. Can. Hoc. est. This heavenly Sacrament, because it doth truely represent the flesh of Christ, is called the Body of Christ, but improperly, not in the truth of the thing, but in the mysticall Sense, to wit, it is called the Body of Christ, that is, it signifieth his Body, So your Glosse, which you may not deny to be the glosse or Tongue of your whole Church, because it hath beene confirmed by the same Authority of PopeGregorius XIII. Papa. In the privilege before the body of the Canon Law. Gregory the thirteenth, wherewith your Extravagants, and former Decrees of Popes have beene Authorized. CHALLENGE. IF all Protestants should meete at once in one Synod, and should conspire together, as labouring to prove a figurative Sense in these words of Christ [This is my Body,] I suppose that a more exact, perspicuous, copious, and ponderous Proofe could not be desired, than hitherto hath beene evinced from your owne Confessions; grounded aswell upon sound and impregnable Reasons, as upon direct Testimonies of holy Scriptures. That the former Figurative Sense of the words of Christ is a∣greeable to the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers of the Greeke Church. SECT. VI. YOu will needs defend your literall Exposition by the ver∣dict of Ancient Fathers, and wee appeale to the Venera∣ble
Senate both of Greek and Latin Fathers. TheGraeci Patres vocant Eucharistiam , quae sunt apud nostros fi∣gurae, Sacramenta, Signa; & haec om∣nia  accepere. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 30. p. 383.

And one as expressely as any Protestant can speake (even Theodoret by name) that Christ here gave to the Signe the name of his Body, as else-where he gave to his Body the name of the Signe. {fleur-de-lys} And againe, Ibid.

So he Marke, no otherwise is the Wine in the Eucharist called Christ's Blood after Consecration, than the juyce of the Grape is called The Blood of the Vine. Which who knoweth not to be improperly and figuratively spoken? {fleur-de-lys} You cannot deny but these Phrases of Signes and Symbols are most frequent in the writings of all the Greeke Fathers, which wee take to be a convincing Argument, untill you can give us some reasonable Solution hereunto. To this purpose you, leaving the principall Objections, fasten onely upon cer∣taine Crotchets, and thereupon you bestirre your selves. THE FIRST CHALLENGE. Against the first Romish Answer, touching the word, Type, and Antitype, used by the Greeke Fathers. THree kindes of Answers have beene applyed, as Three wedges to dissolve this difficulty; but a knot of wood cannot be loosed with a wedge of waxe, such as every of your Answers will appeare to bee. The first interpreting Types and Antitypes not to be taken for Signes, but for Examples, is at the first hearing rejected by yourPrima solutio; Vocem Antitypon non accipi pro Sig∣no, sed pro Exem∣plari, &c. sed haec opinio facilè rejici potest, quia vox ea nunquam sumitu pro exemplari.

The Second, alleged out of Damasen, and much insisted upon by some favourers of your Romish Sense: namely, that the Fathers should call Bread and Wine Antitypes; but not
after Consecration. So they. And if so, then indeed we should have no cause to oppose. But this Answer is proved to be ap∣parantly false by yourAltera solutio est aliorum, Panem & Vinum Antitypon dic, sed ante Con∣secrationem, non po∣steà; ita respondit olim Ioh.

None can need any better Instructor, in this point, than was one (albeit a Protestant) most conversant in Greek Antiquity, namely Mr. Isaac Casaubon. He instanceth most especially in Cyrill of HierusalemCyrillus p. 522. de Chrysmate disse∣rens, ait fideles  Locus ille conside∣ratione digniffimus. Sic enim docet: Quando fideles baptizantur, eos accipere . At de isto Christo ita loquitur:  Ecce, opponuntur  Sp. Sancti, & . Chri∣stum in Baptismo suo accepisse ipsam essentiam Sp. Sancti in se advenientis: sed nos accipere tantùm , quod tamen ipse appellat Sp. Sanctum. Et sanè ita passim legimus in S. S. hos aut illos accepisse Spiri∣tum Sanctum, quùm intelligamus non ipsam essentiam Sp. Sancti, sed vim &  Sp. Sancti. Cur non idem dicemus de S. Eucharistiâ? Patres vetustissimi dicunt nos in eâ accipere  corporis Christi: ergò non accipimus : dicitur camen quod accipimus ; sed eo modo, quo modò dice∣bamus capi Sp. Sanctum. Itaque illud etiam quod accipimus dicitur Gratia, &c. Haec Isaacus Casaub. teste filio suo pientissimo Meirico, ex M. S. Paternis. telling you that the materiall oyle, wherwith Christians were anoynted, was called by Cyrill the Antitype of Christs owne anoynting, which was the Spirit of God it selfe. That The essentiall Spirit of God is opposed to the An∣titype, which was materiall oyle. And, notwithstanding, that the same Antitype is called by Cyrill the Spirit of God; and after, that the Christians are sayd to receive the Spirit;
when neverthelesse they receive not the essence, but the Energie and efficacious operation of the same Spirit. That learned man concludeth; The most ancient Fathers (saith he) sayd that we receive the Antitype of Christ in the Eucharist: Therefore they meant, that we do not receive it essentially. You, for want of other support, presse the sentence of Cyrill of Alexandria.Ob. Cyril. Alex. ad Coelosyr. Episc. Nè dubites an verum sit, cùm dicit manifestè [Hoc est corpus me∣um:] sed potens fide tene verba Christi. Doubt not (saith he) of the truth of Christs speech, when hee saith manifestly [This is my Body] but rather beleeve his words, This is that Testimony of Cyrill, which although it bee out of an Epistle, not found in the an∣cient Editions, but of a latter date, and but some few yeares agoe set forth (as your IesuitePossevin. Ap∣parat. Tit. Cyrillus Alex.—Paucos ante annos edlta est ejus Epistola ad Coelo∣syr. Episc. [And Bel∣larm. seemeth not to be so confident hereof, when in objecting this, he had rather remit his Reader to Garce∣tius, to see the place, than insist upon the words himselfe, say∣ing; Solet citari Epi∣stola ejus ad Coelosy∣rium, vide locum apud Ioh. Garcetium. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 26.] Possevin confesseth) yet doubt not we to embrace it in Cyrils sense: who having now to deale with such Heretikes, who taught that Christ had but a seeming Phantasticall Body, doth refute them by Christs speech of this Sacrament, saying, [This is my Body.] Which, Sacramentally spoken and understood, must needs evince, that Christ had a true naturall Body in himselfe, because this Sacrament was instituted to bee a Signe of a true, and truly-crucified Body, not a Signe of a Figure, but of a reall thing: and therefore requireth in the Receiver not fancie, but faith to beleeve that Christ had a Substantiall body, which is the very Argument of TertullianSee Sect. 9. fol∣lowing. afterwards, a∣gainst the same delusion of the sayd Heretikes. Chrysost. in 1. Cor. c. 10. Hom. 24. [Quoniam unus pa∣nis, & unum corpus multi sumus.] Quid enim appello, inquit, communicationem? [Idem ipsum corpus sumus.] Quidnam est panis? [corpus Christi.] Quid autem fiunt qui accipiunt corpus Christi? non multa, sed [unum corpus.] Nam quemadmo∣dum panis ex multis granis unitur, ut mi∣nimè grana appare∣ant, sed tamen grana sunt, verum incertâ discretione conjuncta invicem: ità & nos Christo cōjungimur, non enim alio corpo∣re tu, alio ille aliter, sed eodem omnes. Chrysostome, being so eminent a Doctor of the Greeke Church, may in no case be left out: he comparing the Speech of Christ, calling Bread his Body; and the words of the A∣postle, in calling the Companie of the faithfull Communi∣cants also the Body of Christ, asketh, concerning the first, What is Bread? and answereth, The Body of Christ: and accordingly touching the second, What those faithfull Com∣municants are made, which receive the Body of Christ? An∣swereth, They are made the Body of Christ. But the faithfull Receivers (as you know) are not properly Christs Body. The onely Answer that your Cardinall would affoord us, is, thatBellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 22. Respon∣det, Loquitur Chry∣sostomus de pane consecrato. Chrysostome spake of Bread Consecrated, and not before Consecration. Which Answer doth fortifie our Argument, to shew that Chrysostome held it to bee Bread still after Consecration, as appeareth in his other saying concerning the same Consecrated Bread, or Loafe (as it signi∣fieth the mysticall Body of Christ) in that As Bread is united of many granes of Corne, not discernable, but yet are still the granes of Corne, joyned secretly one with another. So are wee joyned together with Christ his owne Body. So Chrysostome. Which words can in no wise bee affirmed of your Romish meere Accidents of Bread, wherein there is no mixture of
any Granes of Corne, or of Vnion one with another in one Loafe, whereby to betoken the Vnion of godly Christi∣ans joyntly in one Christ. And therefore certainely Saint Chrysostome beleeved the continuance of the substantiall matter of Bread, after the words of Consecration. All these former Testimonies of Antiquity fight as well also by necessary Consequence against your Individuum va∣gum, that is, [THIS,] you know not what: even as Iustine, one of the ancientest of Fathers, doth declare, wherein hee saithIustin. Quaest. & Resp. ad Graecos. Qu. 229. pag. 151. . There is not any Thing, but it is [This same Some∣thing:] there is not a Body which is not [This same Body.] So he, according to Aristotle, denying any thing to bee called [This Thing] properly, which is not absolutely and determinately This one Individuall thing. Your quaintest device is yet behind.{fleur-de-lys} A SECOND CHALLENGE, Against the last and most peremptory Romish Pretence, making Christ in this Sacrament to figure, and to represent him∣selfe, as a King in a Stage-play. THe Solution, which seemeth to your Disputers most per∣swasive, is thus set downe by your Cardinall, and your Iesuite Suarez, viz.Solutio.

The Greeke Fathers called Bread and Wine, Antitypes, and Signes of the Body and Blood of Christ, be∣cause the same Body and Blood of Christ, as they are in this Sacra∣ment, under the formes of Bread and Wine, are Signes of the same his Body and Blood, as they were on the Crosse. Like as a King, who having gotten a vistory in battell, should represent himselfe in a Stage-Play, as in a fight. So They. But without any Sen∣tence of any Father, for countenancing so egregious a figment; so farre were the Fathers from using that counterfeit Testi∣mony, which passeth under the name of Saint Augustine, as if he had said; The flesh of Christ is a Sacrament of his flesh: and inferring from hence, that The Body of Christ, as it is in this Sa∣crament, is a signe of it selfe, as it was upon the Crosse.

Hic sanè locus omninò convinci, nam quod dicit, oporet credere ipsum esse verum, excludit Tropos, praesertim cum addat, excidere à Salute qui non credit: quod etiam addit ciedendum esse, licet sensus repugnent, apertissime testatur, non cum loqui de signi∣ficatione, sed de re ipsa. [words to be observed in the Greeke are these: . The last words shew that Insensible is taken according to power, that is, actively.] Objection, and our Answer, and then make your owne determination, as you shall thinke good. Man is said to be made after the Image of God. Epiphanius, not able to define what this Image consisted in, whether it be man's soule, or minde, or virtue; notwithstanding resolveth thatc All men have the Image of God in them, but yet not according to nature, (namely, that substantiall nature which is in God) because God is Incomprehensible and infinite, &c. This is the maine point which Epiphanius will now illustrate: but how? By something (saith your Cardinall) which seemeth to be that which it is not: And Epiphanius instanceth in the Eucharist, wherein Christ ta∣king into his hands those things which the Evangelists do mention, he said of the one [HOC] This is mine, viz. Body; and of the o∣ther, This is mine, viz. Blood: hereby understanding (saith your Objector) The Eucharist, which is truely the Body of Christ, although it seeme not to be so, outwardly, being of a round figure, and Insensible (or without sense) and therefore farre unlike to be the Body of Christ. So he. Who, thinking he hath overcome, doth raise up his Iö, and Triumph, saying, This argument is throughly convincent, because Epiphanius addeth, He who belie∣veth not the words of Christ, doth fall from Salvation: adding further, that they are to be beleeved, although our senses gaine∣say it. You have heard the Objection, which seeming to so great a Champion so greatly Convincent, you will give us licence to
make a full Answer. First, by HOC ET HOC, THIS AND THIS (by the Interpretation of Epiphanius) are meant, The things which the Evangelist did mention; and the Evangelist mentioned (as you know) Bread, [He tooke Bread, He tooke the Cup,] meaning Wine in the Cup, namely, according to theSee above Chap. 1. §. 6. former generall Consent of the Fathers, [HOC] signifyed Bread in one part of the Eucharist, and Wine in the other. But Bread neither in the Substance, nor in the Accidents can be called Christs Body, without a Trope, as hath beeneSee above Chap. 1. §. 4. Confessed: which is our first confutation of your Cardinal, who concludeth that Epiphanius excludeth all Tropes out of Christs Speech of [HOC.] SecondlyEpi∣phanius in An∣corato. Habent omnes id quod est secundùm I∣maginem Dei, sed non secun∣dùm naturam: non enim se∣cundùm aequa∣litatem habent homines, Deus enim mente in∣cō prehensibilis est, cum spiri∣tus sit super omnem spiritū. All men (saith Epiphanius) have the Image of God, al∣though not according to nature, or equality; because God, the Spirit of Spirits, is Incomprehensible. Then he seeketh a Similitude from the Eu∣charist, an Image of a thing which seemeth to be that, which in na∣ture and equality it is not. Now in the Eucharist there are two things to be distinguished, the one is the Naturall, the other is the Sacra∣mentall Being thereof. The Naturall Being of the Elements, as of Bread and Wine, cannot make this Similitude; because, whether they be taken as Substances or Accidents, [Hoc, This] hath no propor∣tion with the word which is called [Meum] meaning Christs Body, because the Hoc (as Epiphanins saith) is a Round figure. But as Hoc and Hoc are Sacramentall Images, representing Meum and Meum, Christs Body and Blood: the Bread broken to betoken his Body cruci∣fyed, and the Wine poured out a-part, to signifie Christs Blood Shed: so will the Similitude be most Harmonicall. Even as Bread and Wine in the Eucharist, although they differ in nature, yet are they repre∣sentative Signes and Images of the Body and Blood of Christ. So the Image of God in man, hath a resemblance of the Godhead, although in respect of Nature and Equality it be as different as Finite and Infi∣nite, Comprehensible and Incomprehensible. According to which Analogicall, Mysticall, and acramentall sense, upon the hearing of these words of Epiphanius, Whosoever will not believe Christs words, as hee said, falleth from grace, wee willingly shall say Amen. The ra∣ther, because Epiphanius being an Adversarie to the Marcionites, who denyed Christ to have a True Body, but onely Phantasticall, notwithstanding whatsoever proofe from mens senses, who saw and felt them; they could not digest the Faith of the Romish Church, which teacheth that that, which Epiphanius calleth Bread after Con∣secration, should be (contrary to the Demonstration of oure Senses, as of Seeing, Smelling, Feeling and Tasting) meere Accidents. Thirdly (a place as observable as any other) He saith of this, [Hoc] which is of a round figure, and differing in nature and proportion from that [Meum] which is the Body of Christ, that it is , Insensible: But how, Passively? as not being able to be perceived? No, for then it could not be perceived to be Round. But Actively, as not able to perceive any thing, in which respect hee opposeth it to [Meum,] which is the Body of Christ. Which againe manifestly contradicteth
the abominable cōmon doctrine of your Church, as you have heard, of Believing the Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, to be un∣able either to see or heare, or exercise any faculty of sense without a Mi∣racle; as is shewed, Book. 4. Chap. 9. Sect. 2. In the last place I require Iustice from your selves against a Pro∣ctor of yours. The Case is this: Bellarmine said (quoth I) that Epi∣phanius taught, We are to believe these words of Christ, although they be repugnant to our senses: which last words [Although they be repugnant to our senses] said I, No man of sense can find in Epiphanius. This saith the Proctor is a false Taxation. And I, for my Iustification, shall de∣sire no other Advocate than Bellarmines owne words, Hic locus E∣piphanij omninò convincit, quia addit etiam (nimirum Epiphanius) Hoc esse credendum, licet sensus repugnent. And now when you shal summ up the Premises, you will easily judge how the Testimonie of Epi∣phanius will be held to be Convincent. That the same Greeke Fathers have expresly unfolded their Meanings, touching a Figurative Sense. SECT. VIII. THe Iudgement of a whole Councel of Greek Fathers may well suffice for the manifestation of the Iudgement of that Church; They in their Councel at Trullo, alluding to these words of Christ, [This is my Body] saying, Let nothing be offered, but the Body and Blood of Christ, that is (sayIn san∣ctis nihil plus quàm corpus & sanguis Christi offeratur, ut ip∣se Dominus tradidit, hoc est panis & vinū aquâ mixtum. Concil. Constāt. apud Binium, [which Canon was made a∣gainst the A∣quaij (those who would use no Wine) Can. 32.] called Sy∣nodus quini∣sexta. They) Bread and Wine, &c. If we had not told you that this had been the speech of Greek Fathers in a Councel, you would have conceived they had bin uttered by some Heretike, as your Charity useth to call us Protestants. Neither may the Authority of this Councel be rejected by you, as unlawfull in the point of the Sa∣crament, because your Binius, in opposing against some things in this Councel, yet never tooke any Exception against this Canon. We may not let passe another Testimony, used by the ancient Fa∣ther See above, §. 6. at the Let. (x). Theodoret, namely, That Christ called the Bread his Body, as he called his Body Bread, Matth. 12. saying therof, Except the grane of wheat die, &c. insomuch that interchangably in the one place, He gave to the Signe the name of his Body, and in the other, He gave to his Body the name of the Signe. So he. As Protestantly as either Calvin or Beza could speak. And you cannot deny, but that when Christ called his Body Bread, it was an improper and Figurative speech. And therfore, if you will believe Theodoret, you are compellable to confesse, that Christ, in calling Bread his Body, ment it not in a proper & literal sense. {fleur-de-lys}Wee were about to proceed, but that your Doctor Hes∣kins will needs crosse us in our way, by objecting the Cur∣rent of Oecumenius in his Exposition of those words of the A∣postle, Wee are all one Body, inasmuch as wee are partakers of one Bread, saying:Dr. Hes∣kins in his Par∣liam. of Christ. Booke 3. C. 28. Oecū. in 1. Cor. 11. Quid est panis? Corpus Christi: Quid efficiunturij qui participant? Corpus sanè Christi, quia ait Apostolus, [unus panis, & unum corpus sumus, quia de uno pane participamus] ex multis namque granis (ut exempli gra∣tia loquamur) unus panis factus est; & nos multi ex uno pane participantes efficimur unum corpus Christi. What is one Bread? the Body of Christ:
and what are they made that partake of this one Bread? The Body of Christ: for this one Bread is made of many granes, and we being many partakers of one Bread, are made one Body. Hence your Doctor; In my judgement this needeth no explanation: for asking a question [what is Bread?] he answereth, [The Body of Christ.] Note then (Reader) he saith not it is a Signe of Christs Body, but the Body of Christ VERILY, where he speaketh both of the Bread partaken, which he saith is Verily Christs Body; and also of the Partakers, who be made the my∣sticall Body of Christ; wherein the Reader may see how rightly he confirmeth the Catholike faith. So he. And so wee thinke he doth; but then must not your Po∣pish, be this Catholike faith, because Oecumenmus calleth (so) Bread the Body of Christ Sacramentally, as hee calleth the Partakers of the same Bread, or Loafe, the mysticall Body of Christ. But the Partakers and Communicants are Christs my∣sticall Body only Figuratively, and by Analogy; therfore the Bread is named the Naturall Body of Christ Figura∣tively, and as the Symboll thereof; as Christ himselfe cal∣leth it, by the Iudgement of Antiquitie, throughout the Second Booke. Which therfore the Apostle here calleth Bread, after Consecration; and, as Oecumenius noteth, such Bread as consisteth of many granes of Corne; which must needs be Substantially Bread, thereby to represent the people, con∣sisting of many Persons in one Communion. o but Oecume∣nius (saith your Doctor) speaking of Bread, called Christs Body, nameth it VERILY Christs Body, which is (if it be lawfull to speake rudely) a very-Lye. For the words, Verè Corpus Christi, Verily Christs Body, are attributed to the Partakers of the Bread, which are the mysticall Body of Christ; and not either to the Bread, or Naturall Body of Christ. Hitherto of the Greeke Fathers. That the same Figurative Sense of Christs words is avouched by the Testimonies of the Latine Fathers; more largely (now) insisted on. SECT. IX. SOme of the Latine Fathers (we confesse) seeme in some pla∣ces to deny all Figurative sense, but this they doe even by a Figure calledAs is afterwards many wheres discove∣red. Hyperbole, that is, only in the excesse of Speech, thereby to abstract the minds of sensuall men from fixing their thoughts upon externall Rites, and to raise them up to a Sacra∣mentall and Spirituall Contemplation of the Body and Blood of Christ. But as for the direct and perspicuous Sentences of these
Fathers, they clearely and exactly teach a Figurative sense in the words of Christ; (to wit)Tertull. con∣tra Marcion. lib. 4. pag. 233. Edit Paris. Profellus est Chri∣stus se concupivisle edere Pascha ut su∣um: indignum enim ut aliquid alienum concupisceret Deus: acceptum panem & distributum Discipu∣lis corpus suum fecit, Hoc est corpus me∣um dicendo, id est, Figura corporis mei: figura enim non fu∣isset, nisi veritatis es∣set corpus. Caeterum vacua res, quod est phantasma, figuram capere non potest. Tertullian whose words are as plaine as any glasse can be, saying of Christ, Hee distributed his Body, that is, a Signe of his Body. {fleur-de-lys}The Fantastike Marcionites held, that Christ had no essentiall Body, but onely a figurative, and Fantasticall. These Heretikes Tertullian confuteth by Christ his Institu∣tion of the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, (as theAt the let. (p.) Mar∣gin will shew you) thus: Nothing that is fantasticall is capa∣ble of a figure; because this were to make a signe of a Signe, or figure. But Christ in this Sacrament gave a Signe of his Body: Therefore Christ had (namely, in himselfe) a Reall and Substantiall Body, and not fantasticall. That he gave a Figure of his Body, hee proveth out of the Gospel, where hee is found desirous to eate his owne Passeover with his Disci∣ples, when taking Bread, he made it his Body, saying, This is my Body, that is a figure of my Body. So he, as Protestantly as can be spoken. Which our Collection, your miserable shift, how to ridde your selves of it, doth rather confirme unto us;Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 7. Illud Tertulliani [Hoc est corpus meum] Id est, non significat panem Eucharisae esse sigu∣ram corporis Domi∣ni, sed quod fuit olim figura in Testamen∣to veteri, nunc in ve∣ritatem corporis mu∣tatum esse—Con∣jungitur enim figura corporis mei, cùm hoc, ut sit sensus, Hoc, Id est, Panis qui olim fuit figura cor∣poris mei. The Sense is this (saith your Cardinall) THIS, that is, This Bread which was once (namely, in the old Testament) a signe of my Body. So he. O the profundity of this Answer! Is a Signe, saith Tertullian; that is, Was a Signe, saith your Cardi∣nall. If one, saying of the Sun-rising, It is in the East, and your Cardinall should comment, saying, that is, It was in the East; would you believe him? And that Tertullian meant directly that the Bread, which he now spoke of, signified not the Bread of the Old Testament, but the Bread of the Eucha∣rist, as it was a Signe then representing the Body of Christ; two reasons may perswade us. First, because Tertullian ob∣serveth that Christ (concerning the participating of the Eucharist) said, That hee desired to eate his owne Passeover; meaning, the Eucharist, as distinct from the Iewish Passeover. Next, because he confuteth the Heretikes, who denyed that Christ had a true Body, by this Sacrament, because Bread herein was a figure of a Body, And Christ's figures were not of things only imaginary; but also reall and essentiall. And this is confessed by your IesuiteMaldon. Ies. de sacra Euchar. §. 13. Conjectura. pag. 295. Dicet aliquis cur Ter∣tullianus figuram vo∣cavit potiùs quàm ve∣ritatem. Respons.

Maldonate, to have beene the Argument of Tertullian, who once againe sheweth that Christ called Bread his Body, in saying, [This is my Body] as the Prophet Ieremy called his Body, Bread, in saying, Let us put Wood upon his Bread, meaning his Body. So Tertullian, shewing them both to be spoken equally in a fi∣gurative sense. These are so directly repugnant to your Ro∣mish doctrine, that one of your Church, in his Admonition before the words of Tertullian, seemes to impute unto Ter∣tullian.

Do but now tell us, how you wish wee should censure this Errour; whether as a wilfull Falsity? and then should you eclipse his Credit and Authority: or else only as a Temeritie? and then ought you to Censure as indifferently of such escapes (if any such happen) of Prote∣stants, according to the Law of Equitie—Veniam peti∣musque Damusque vicissim. Saint Augustine (whom one of your profession hath of late more choicely singled out for a Patron of your Romish defence) hath unanswerably impugned your Romish Faith in this very point, proving other Sacraments to agree with this, in like of Predication, and that herein the Eucharist hath not Prerogative above the rest.Aug. lib. 3. de Doctr.

Sacraments (saith he) for the very Similitude and likenesse, wihich they have with the things wherof they are Sacraments, do often take the names of those things which they do signific, as when the Sacrament of Christ's Body (saith he) is after a certaine manner called the Body of Christ. But how? Hee ad∣deth (as if hee had meant to stop the Mouthes of all Opposites) As it is said by the Apostle of Baptisme [we are buried by Baptisme into the death of Christ, ] He saith not we signifie his buriall, but ab∣solutely saith [we are buried:] therfore hath he called the Sacra∣ment
or Signe of so great a thing by the name of the thing signi∣fied thereby. So hee, even the same Hee, who will bee found like himselfe in the following passages of this and other books, especially when wee shall handle the Manner of eating of Christs Body, which Augustine will challenge to bee Figura∣tively meant. {fleur-de-lys} Your Answerers are so puzzled with Saint Augustine his Testimonies, that you may doubt whether rather to pity their perplexities, or else to hate their perversenesse; as you may see by another Testimony of the same Father, which wee may not let passe.Aug. con.

Gordon. Ies. lib. Controv. 3. cap. 7. num. 21. [Petra erat Christus, 1. Cor. 10.] Germanus & litera∣lis sensus non est iste, Petra significat Christum, ut putant Adversarij, qui ex hoc loco contendunt probare, verbum sub stantivn, Est, ali∣quandò usurpari pro, significat, ut indè fa∣ciliùs ignris persua∣deant verbum, Est, in verbis Christi idem valere quod sig∣nificat. The Literall and Proper Sense of these words (saith hee) is not that which our Adversaries (meaning Protestants) doe hold [The Rocke signified Christ:] contending hereupon to prove that the Verbe [EST] is some∣time used for [SIGNIFIETH] that thereby they may the more easily perswade that the word [EST] in Christs Speech is the same, in Sense, with [SIGNIFIETH.] So hee. What Heretike could have more confronted Saint Augustine, than your Iesuite hath, by denying the words [The Rocke was Christ] to bee in true Sense, Did Signifie Christ? Se∣condly, that [Est] elsewhere is used in Scripture for [Sig∣nificat:] in both which Saint Augustine is as absolute an Ad∣versarie; and yet no more in these than, indeed, in the whole Cause concerning the Corporall presence of Christ in this Sa∣crament.
And the cause of Saint Augustines interpretation is plaine: For Adimantus the Manichee objected to the Iewe;Aug. cont. Adimant. quo sap. A∣dimantus Manichae∣us it, secundùm in∣tellectum Iudaeorum, qui dicunt sanguinem esse animam, sequi, &c. That they understood by the other Text [The blood of the Beast is the soule thereof] not that it was conteined in the soule, or joyned with the soule: but that it is the soule it selfe. This is that Li∣terall interpretation, which Augustine declineth, and ex∣poundeth the words as spoken Figuratively, Signe, for the thing signified, asSee above at the letter (u). hee did in the speech of Christ, saying of Bread, This is my Body. And doth notCyril. Hier. Catech. Mistag. 2 . Cyril call Bap∣tisme the Antitype of Christs Passion? Saint Augustine desireth to have one word more.Aug. in lib. Sent. Prosperi. De Consecrat. Dist.  Cap.—Hoc est quod dicimus sicut ergò coelestis panis, qui Christi caro est, suo modo vocatur corpus Christi, cum reverâ sit Sacramē. u n cor∣poris Christi; illius videlicet quod visibi∣le, quod palpabile,  mortale in cruze po∣situm est, vocatur{que} ipsa immolatio car∣nis, quae Sacerdotis manibus sit, Christi passio, mors, crucifi∣xio: non rei verita∣te, sed significante mysterio. The Heavenly Bread (saith hee) which is Christ's flesh, is called after a maner the Body of Christ, when as indeed it is the Sa∣crament of Christ's Body, to wit, of that Body which is vi∣sible, palpable, mortall: and the Immolation of his flesh, which is done by the hands of the Priest, is called Christ's Passion, Death, and Crucifixion, but not in the veritie of the thing, but in a Significant mysterie. So he. Which words, if they should need a Comment, can have no better, than is your owne publike privileged Romish Glosse upon them, say∣ing, Glssa in eum locum. [Coelestis] Id est Coeleste Sacra∣mentum, quod verè repraesentat Christi carnem, dicitur cor∣pus Christi, sed im∣propriè; unde dicitue suo modo, non rel veritate; sed signisi∣cante mysterio, ut sit sensus, vocatur cor∣pus Christi, id est, Significat. The Heavenly Sacrament, which truly represen∣teth Christ's flesh, is called the Body of Christ IMPROPERLY, where it is said to be after a certaine maner the Bodie of Christ. There are foure principall Observables in this one sentence of Saint Augustine. I. Your Doctors have vilified our Sacrament, because wee, judging it to be Bread, do but onely account it a Sa∣crament of Christ's Body; Saint Augustine doth here re∣prove them, as directly as if hee had said, Though it be but a Sacrament of Christ's Body, yet is it to be estee∣med as Heavenly Bread. II. As often as you reade of the Bread called Christ's Body, you straine it to your owne sense, as directly demonstrating Christ's Body: Saint Augustine tel∣leth you that it is in it selfe onely the Sacrament of his Bodie. III. Yea but (say your Doctors) The Body of Christ herein is a Sacrament and gne of himselfe, as he was on the Crosse: Nay will S. Augustine say, not so, for the Body of Christ is Invisible, and insensibl unto us; but the Sacrament is a thing repre∣senting unto us a visible, palpable, and mortall Body of Christ. IV. Your men are still instant to interpret it of Christ's Bo∣dy Corporally present therein; and S. Augustine offereth to illuminate your understandings by the light of a Similitude, saying, The thing in the hands of the Priest is so called Christ's Flesh, as his Immolation of Christ's Body, heerein, is called Christ's Passion: and that it is not properly, and lively so meant, but [Suo modo] that is, (as your owne Glosse ex∣poundeth it) IMPROPERLY. Can any thing be more re∣pugnant
to your Romish Doctrine of this Sacrament; than this one Testimony of Saint Augustine is from point to point? The Bp. Facundus, who lived about the yeare 546. (an Au∣thor much magnified by yourIac. Sirmun∣dus. Ies. Epist. Dedic. ante lib. Facundi. Maximam Romanae sedis potestatem ce∣lebrat. and Baron. Ann. Chri. 546. num. 24. Prudentissimus Ecclesiasticus Agoni∣stes Facundus. Iesuit, as one who extolleth the Authority of the See of Rome; and by your Cardinall, as a most wise Champion of the Church) must needs deserve of you so much credit, as to think that he would write nothing, con∣cerning this Sacrament of Christ, which hee judged not to be the received Catholike doctrine of that his Age. Hee thus;Facundus l. 9. defens. Trin. Cap. 5. Sacramentum Adop∣tionis suscipere dig∣natus est Christus: & quandò circumci∣sus est, & quandò baptizatus: & potest Sacramentum Adop∣tionis, Adoptio, nun∣cupari, sicut Sacra∣mentum corporis & sanguinis ejus, quod est in pane & poculo consecrato, corpus ejus & sanguinem dicimus: non quòd propriè id Corpus ejus sit Panis, & po∣culum sanguis, sed quod in se myste∣rium Corporis & sanguinis continet. The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, which is in the Bread and Cup, wee call his Body and Blood, not that it is properly his Body and Blood, but because it containeth a mysterie of his Body and Blood. Iust the dialect of Protestants. Your Iesuit vainly labouring to rectifie this sentence, by the sentences of other Fathers, in the end is glad to perswade the Readers to pardon this Father Facundus: If Peradven∣ture (Idem. Sir∣mundus Ies. Annot. in locum istum Facun∣di. pag. 404. Quod si durius hic fortasse & obscurius quippi∣am locutus videatur, dignus est veniâ, & qui à benigno inter∣prete vicem officij recipiat, quod & alijs studisè, quorum dicta notabantur, non semel exhibuit. saith hee) hee hath spoken somewhat more harshly or ob∣scurely, as one who himselfe having interpreted other mens Say∣ings favourably, may deserve the like Courtesie of others. Thus that Iesuite. But what Pardon can the Iesuite himselfe merit of his Reader, in calling the Testimony Obscure, and darke, which the Father Facundus himselfe, by a Similitude, ma∣keth as cleare as day, Thus; As Christ, being Baptized, recei∣ved the Sacrament of Adoption: the Sacrament of Adoption may be called Adoption; even as the Sacrament of Christ's Body is called Christ's Body. A saying which in your Church of Rome is now accounted a downe-right Heresie. {fleur-de-lys} We shall take our Farewell of the Latine Fathers, in the Testi∣mony of Bish. Isidore, who will give you his owne Reason, why Christ called Bread his Body:Isidor. Hispalensis. Panis, quem frangimus, corpus Christi est, qui dicit, Ego sum panis vivus, &c. Vinum autem sanguis ejus est, & hoc est quod scriptum est, Ego sum vitis vera. Sed Panis, quià confirmat Corpus, ideò corpus Christi nuncupatur: Vinum autem quià sanguinem ope∣ratur in carne, ideò ad sanguinem Christi resertut—Haec autem sunt visibilia, sanctificata tamen per spi∣ritum Sanctum, in Sacramentum divini corporis transeunt. Lib. 1. de Offic. cap. 18. Bread (saith he) because it strength∣neth the Body, is therfore called the Body of Christ: and Wine, because it maketh Blood, is therefore referred to Christ's Blood: but these two being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, are changed into a Sacra∣ment of the Body and Blood of Christ. So he.
{fleur-de-lys} A Cleare Glasse, wherein the judgment of Antiquitie, for a Figurative sense of Christ's words [This is my Bo∣dy,] may be infallibly discerned. SECT. X. POnder with your selves, for Gods cause, the accurate judgement of Ancient Fathers, in their direct dilucida∣tions and expressions of their understanding of Christ's mea∣ning, in calling Bread his Body in this sense, viz. that It signi∣fieth his Body, as a Signe thereof.

Bread hath the name of Christ's Bodie, albeit it remaine in nature the same. And Ephraimius naming it Christ's Bodie, which is received of the faithfull, saith,See ibid. It loseth nothing of it's Sensible Substance. (Then Bread sure, as followeth by his parallel∣ling it with Baptisme:) And Baptisme being One, representeth the propriety of its Sensible Substance of Water. These are as direct, as ever Bucer or Calvin could speake. Somewhat more, for Corroboration sake. But yet by the way, if wee shall consult withBertram de Corpore & sanguine Domini (after that he had cited Am∣brose, Hierome, Au∣stine, Origen, & Ful∣gentius) saith. Ani∣madvertat (clarissimè Princeps) sapientia vestra. quod positis sanctarum rupturarum testimonijs, & sanctorum Patrum dictis, evidentissimè monstra∣tum est, quod panis, qui corpus Christi, & Cals qui sanguis Christi appellatur, figura sit, quà mysterium: & quod non parva differe,  corpus, quod per mysterium existit, & corpus quod passum est. Quia hoc proptum Servatoris corpus st, nec in eo aliqua figura est, sed ipsa rei manifestatio—At in isto quod per mysterium geritur, figura est non solum proprij Christi corporis, verumetiam credentis in Christum populi. Ber∣tram, to know what he hath observed both out of Scrip∣tures, and Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, (by name, Ambrose, Augustine, Hierome, and Fulgentius) he doth tell his Prince, and Emperour, that They demonstrate, that the Bread which is called the Bodie of Christ, is a figure, because a
Mysterie, and that there is no small difference betweene the same Body, which is the Mysterie, and the Bodie which was cru∣cified; for that this is the proper Bodie of Christ, and no figure, but a manifestation. But in that which is done by a Mysterie, there is a figure both of the proper Bodie of Christ, and also of the people that believe in him. The same Orthodoxe Fathers of Primitive times (thir∣teene in number) have told us already that Christ called See above. B. 2. Cha. 1 Sect. 6. Bread his Body, which hath beene the overthrow of your Romish Expositions of Christ's speech, as you have heard: Saint Cyprian, saying, that Christ created his owne Body, there∣by (as youryp ian. See Book 3. . 4 Sect. 2. (in  second Edi¦ion) Cardinall confessed) meaning Bread. The Fa∣thers of the Councel of Carthage, forbidding any thing to be offered in this mysterie but Bread and Wine, mixed with Water, deliver their Canon thus;Conc. Carag. Tempare Bont, Can 37. Or  Ltta. apud Bin. Canon. 4. In Sacramento cor∣poris & sanguinis Domini nihil ampli∣us offeratur, quàm quod Dominus pro∣didit, hoc est, Panis & Vnum aquâ mix∣tum. [Which is a most corrupt Transta¦tion, and ought to bee thus: Nihil amplius quàm corpus & san∣guis Domini, id est, Panis & Vinum.] Which is recor∣ded, De Consecrat. Cap. In Sacramento. [It can be no Answer to say, that they meant the Layffering be∣fore Consecration, be∣caue they call that Offering, now spoken of, The Body and Blood of Christ, which all know to bee spoken Sacerdotally, before it was conse∣crated. That nothing in those sacred mysteries be offered more than the Body and Blood of Christ, as Christ himselfe hath ordained. That is (say they) than the Bread and Wine. Hereby plainly teaching, that as they are called Christ's Bodie and Blood, in their Sacramen∣tall and Mysticall use and signification; so are they Bread and Wine, in their proper essence. The foresaid Canon is regi∣stred among the Papall Decrees. The Heretike Novatus binding some Receivers of the Eucharist to his part, by saying,Euseb. lib. 6. Cap. 35. Verba Nova∣ti Eucharistiam sump∣turo: Iura mihi per corpus & sanguinem Domini, te nunquàm me deserturum, &c. Whereupon Eusebius; Miser ille homo non priùs degustavit,—Graec. , &c. Here the Translator omitteth, in his Translation, the word, , Bread. Sweare to me, by the Bodie and Blood of Christ, not to depart from mee: Hereupon Eusebius; So the misera∣ble man did not receive that Bread, before he had said, Amen; that is, given consent to the Motion of Novatus. Where we finde Eusebius calling it Bread, which had beene Consecrated by Novatus, and named The Bodie of Christ. This our Col∣lection may be held so much the rather of some force, be∣cause the Romish Translator, which was Christoferson, Bi∣shop of Chichester, (according to his guise els-where) did fairely leave out the word [Bread,] but is a foule fault in a Translator of an History. Will you have any more? you may admit into the same Cuire these other Suffrages of Cyprian, Hierome, Euche∣rius, and Primasius.See afterwards B. 6. C. 3. §. . Melchizedech in his Oblation of Bread and Wine offered the Body and Blood of Christ, Calling that the Body and Blood of Christ, which then, before Christ his incarnation in the flesh, could bee essentially nothing but Bread and Wine, because it was onely a Type of the Body and Blood of Christ to come. And what will you say to the otherSee afterwards B. 6. C. 5. §. 11. Fathers, who affirmed hereof in as full an Emphasis, that Christ is still Crucified, bleeding, and slaine in this Sa∣crament?
notwithstanding that our Christian Faith, gene∣rally beleeved, denyeth that this can happen to his glori∣fied Body, now after his Resurrection; and therefore such Phrases were to be understood of the breaking of the Bread, and powring out of Wine, Sacramentally and Analogically, (that is) Figuratively representing the Crucifying of his Body, and Shedding of his Blood. The Fathers, who used this accent of speech, were Alexander and Gregory, both Popes of Rome, Chrysostome, Cyprian, Hierome, Cyrill of Hierusa∣lem, Hesychius, Paschasius, Eusebius Emissenus, Enow, one would thinke, to silence all Oppositions of them, who are instant in nothing more than in pressing the Improprie∣ties of the speeches of Antiquitie, in a literall sense, and hereby verifying that Proverbe of Salomon; Qui nimis e∣mugit, elicit sanguinem. Even so they, who by the same Reason, wherby they urge the sayings of Fathers literally, for the proofe of an unbloody Sacrifice, properly so called, must be constrained likewise o admit, against the Catholike faith of all Christians, a Sacrifice properly slaine and bloodie therein. The like will bee proved from their other Hyperboles and the Excessive termes of Antiquitie, viz. of Tearing Christs Bodie, and dying our teeth in his Blood, and the like, (in the Booke 5. tho∣row-out. fifth Booke:) and from their checking their owne Phrase of offering the Sacrifice of his Bodie, by recalling and cor∣recting themselves immediatly thus; Or rather a Memoriall thereof, (in theBooke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 6. sixth Booke.) All these Observations are as demonstrable, for the vindicating of the judgement of An∣cient Fathers, as any Child of the Catholike Church could have desired, if the same holy Fathers had beene intreated to expound their owne meanings. Wee returne to our former Argument. Christ Instituting a Sacrament, and in Taking Bread and Blessing Bread, saying, [This is my Bodie] must necessarily bee understood to have spoken Sacramentally, that is, Figuratively, as hath beene prooved from Scripture; as in all other Sacraments, so likewise in the severall confessed Figurative words of Christ, concerning this Sacrament, by eight severall In∣stances (in this second Booke.) This one Argument of it selfe, hath beene termed by Master Calvin [Murus ahae∣neus] that is, a wall of brasse, and so will it bee found more evidently to bee, when you shall perceive the sameBooke 3. thor∣row-out. Fa∣thers judging that, which they call a Change into Christs Flesh, to bee but a Change into the Sacrament of his Flesh; bread still remaining the same, (in the third Booke.) {fleur-de-lys} And now wee are to withstand your paper-bullets, where∣with you vainely attempt, in your Objections following, to bat∣ter our defence withall.
CHAP. III. The Romish Objections from Reasons, against the Figurative Sense, Answered. The first Objection. SECT. I. NOthing useth to bee more properlie and simplie spoken, (sayPrimum Ar∣gumentum sumitur à materiâ, est enim materia, de quâ hic agitur, Pactum, Sa∣cramentum.

Ergò this being a Testamentary Phrase must be taken in the literall Sense. CHALLENGE. VVHat is this? are Figurative speeches never used in Cove∣nants, and Testamentarie Language? or is there not ther∣fore sufficient perspicuity in Figures? This is your rash and lavish Assertion, for you your selves doe teach thatIn ipsâ Scrip∣tura dicitur Testa∣mentum, & Instru∣mentum—Quia pa∣cta Dei & soedera ini∣ta nobiscum conti∣nent, ut patet in pa∣cto Circumcisionis cum Abrahamo.—Ante omnia praefa∣mur S. Scripturam uti Metaphoris, non solum ob utilitatem nostram, sed etiam propter necessitatem, à pluribus Patribus traditur. Sacram scrip∣turam de Deo, de Trinitate, de Patre, Filio, & Spiritu san∣cto, propriè loqui non passe—Quandò sermo est de vità aeterâ, & paemio siliorum Dei, lais rebus comparatur, per Tropos est explicandus—ut August. ait, Nullo genere lcutionis, quod in consuetudine humanâ reperitur, Scripturae non utuntur, quia utiqué hominibus . Saler Is. Prog. lib. 1. p. 3. & 4. & lib. 21. pag. 371. & 227. 229. 231. 234. The Old and New Testament are both full fraught with multitude of Tropes and Figures, and yet are called Testaments. Secondly, That the Scripture, speaking of the Trinitie, and some divine things, cannot but speake Improperly and siguratively. Thirdly, That Sacramentall speeches, as, [The Rocke was Christ,] and the like words reSee above, Chap. 2. Sect 3. let [c.] Tropicall and Figurative. Fourthly, That even in the Testamentary Speech of Christ, at his Institution of this Sacrament, saying, [This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood:] there is a Figure in the very wordSee above, Chap. 2 Sect. 4. (p. q.) Testament. So have you confessed, and so have you consequently con∣futed your owne Objection. Hereto might bee added the Testament of Iacob, prophe∣sying of his sonnes, and saying,Gen. 49. Reuben is my strength: Iudah a Lions Whelpe: Issachar a strong Asse: Dan an Adder in the
way. All figurative Allusions. Nay, no man, in making his Testament, can call it his Will, or say that hee hath set his hand and Seale unto it, without Figures. Namely, that hee hath gi∣ven by writing a Signification of his Will; that the Subscrip∣tion was made by his Hand; and that he added unto it the Print of his Seale. These Three, Will, Hand, Seale, every word Figu∣rative, even in a Testament. The second Romish Objection, against the Fi∣gurative Sense. SECT. II. LAwes and Precepts (sayVerba Legum & Praeceptorum de∣bent este propria. Bellar lib 1 de Eu∣charist. cap 9. §. Se∣quitur. you) should bee in plaine and proper words: But in the Speech of Christ, [Take; eate you, &c.] are words of Command; Ergò, They may not bee held Figu∣rative. CHALLENGE. CAn you be Ignorant of these Figurative Precepts, viz. of Pulling out a mans owne eye, of cutting off his hand? Mat. 5. Or yee of a Penitents Renting of his heart? Ioel 2. Or of not hardening his heart? Psalme 95. and the like. Christ com∣manded his Disciples to prepare for his keeping the Passe∣over with his Disciples, and the Disciples prepared the Passe∣over as Iesus commanded them, saith theLuc. 22. 8. Evangelist. In this Command is the word [Passeover.] We demand, The word, Passeover, (which is taken for the Sacrament and Signe of the Passeover) is it taken Figuratively? You cannot deny it. And can you deny that a Commandement may bee delivered under a Figurative Phrase? You can both, that is, say and gaine-say any thing, like false Merchants, onely so farre as things may, or may not make for your owne advantage. But (to catch you in your owne snare) your Doctrine of Con∣comitancy is this, viz. Bread, being turned into Christs Body, is joyntly turned into whole Christ; and Wine, being changed in∣to his Blood, is likewise turned into whole Christ, both Flesh and Blood. If then when Christ commanded his Disciples, saying, [Matth. 26. 27. Drinke you All of this, ] that which was Drunke was the whole substantiall Body of Christ, either must his Disciples be sayd to have Drunke Christs Body properly, or else was the Command of Christ figuratively spoken. To say the first, con∣tradicteth the universall expression of mans speech in all Lan∣guages; for no man is sayd to drinke Bread, or any solid thing. And o grant the Second, that the speech is Figurative, con∣tradicteth your owne Objection. Againe, Christ commanded
to Eate his Body; yet notwithstanding have ThreeSe above, Ch. 2. §. 4. (l.) Iesu∣ites already confessed that Christs Body cannot bee sayd to have beene properly Eaten, but Figuratively onely. What fascination then hath perverted your Iudgements; that you cannot but still confound your selves, by your contrary and thwarting Lan∣guages? Your third Romish Objection. SECT. III. DOctrinall and Dogmaticall speeches (sayPraecipua dog∣mata, &c Bellar. quo supra. §. Denota. you) ought to be di∣rect and literall: But these words, [This is my Body] are Doctrinall. CHALLENGE. A Man would marvaile to heare such seely and petty Rea∣sons to bee propounded by those, who are accounted great Clerkes, and those who know full well that the speech of Christ, concerning Castrating or gelding of a man's selfe, is Abulen. in eum loum. Christus non laudat cos, qui ca∣stârunt se, sed qui se castam, concep∣scentiam obscde∣do—ut Chyl Non membro abscisione. sed ma larum cogitationum incepatione: male dictioni nempe ol∣noxius, qui mm brum sibi bscond Idem habet Hieron. Addit Chrysost. su∣per Matth. Abscissis verilibus non tollitur concupiscentia, Con∣cupiscentia inde sit molestior. Doctrinall, and teacheth Mortification; and yet is not li∣terally to bee understood, as you all know by the literall errour ofIdem.

Litera haec occidit. in Levit. Hem 7. It killeth. Secondly, these words [This is the New Testament in my Bood,] they are words as Do∣ctrinall as the other [This is my Body:] and yet figurative, by your owneSee above cap. 2. §. 4. Confession. Thirdly, the words of Christ, Iohn 6. of Eating his flesh, are Doctrinall; and yet, by your owne Verus & hee rals Sensus horum verborum non est quòd caro Christi nihil prodest, sed quod carnalis intelligentia nihil pro∣dest, ut exponunt-Chrys.

Construction, are not to bee properly understood, but as Christ afterwards expounds himselfe, Spiritually. Fourthly, where Christ thus sayd, The Bread, which I shall give, is my stesh, Ioh. 6. 51. he saith also of his Body, that it is True Bread, Ver. 32. and Bread of life, Verse 48. and living Bread, whereof who∣soever eateth liveth eternally, Verse 5. All, Divine and Doctrinall Assertions, yet was his Body figuratively called Bread. Fiftly, that in those words of Christ to Peter, Matth. 6. Vpon this Rocke will I build my Church; And, To thee will I give the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven; And Ioh. 21. Fede my sheepe; (In which texts of Scripture you place, although most falsly, your Doctrinall foundation of Popedome it selfe;) yet know you
all these to be Tropicall Speeches. Yea, and what say you to the first Doctrinall Article, and foundation of Christian Do∣ctrine, delivered by God unto man, in the beginning,Gen. 3. 15. The seed of the woman shall breake the Serpents head? Is not the later part of the Article altogether Figurative, yet signifying this Doctrinall point, even the vanquishing of the power of Satan, who hath neither head nor tayle, but is Metaphorically called a Serpent? Your fourth Romish Objection. SECT. IV. THe Apostles (saith yourBell. Apostoli rudes & simplices e∣rant &c. Lib. 1. de Euch. c. 9. §. Argu∣mentum secundum. Cardinall) were rude and simple: Therefore needed to be Instructed by Christ in plaine tearmes, Without Figures. So he. CHALLENGE. ANd yet Christ, you know, did often speake Figuratively unto them, talking of Bread, Leaven, Seed, &c. And sti∣ling them the Salt of the earth; yea even in this Sacrament (us hath beene confessed) in the words Eate, Shed, Testament. A∣nother Iesuite witnesseth, thatApostoli à Chri∣sto edocti fuerunt, & illuminati, ut cum summâ reverē Sa∣cramentum hoc sus∣ciperent Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 46 §. 3. The Apostles were illuminated and instructed by Christ; that they might receive thus Sacrament with all Reverence. So he. {fleur-de-lys} And so also taught your Doctor Heskins before him:D. Heskins in his Parliament. B. 3. pag. 53. Christ (saith he) instructed his Apostles in the Faith of the blessed Sacrament, before he instituted it. {fleur-de-lys} Therefore are they but rudely, by you, tearmed Rude; and the rather, because They (who being commanded to prepare the Passeover, perceived that by Passeover was figuratively under∣stood the Paschall Lambe, and thereupon prepared the Passeo∣ver, according to the Lord's Command) could not be ignorant, that in this like Sacramentall speech [This is my Bodie] the Pro∣noune [THIS] did literally point out Bread, and siguratively signifie Christ's Body. Doubtlesse, if the manner of Christ's speech in the Eucharist had not beene like the other in the Passe∣over, they would have desired Christ to explaine his meaning, as they did sollicitously in other doubts. Their last Romish Objection. SECT. V. VVEe are never to let passe the Literall Sense (saith your Nunquàm di∣mittamus proprium verborum sensum, nisi cogamur ab ali∣quâ aliâ Scriptura, &c. Bell. l. 1. de Euch. Cap. 9. §. Vltimo. Cardinall) except we be compelled thereunto by some
Scripture, or by some Article of Faith, or by some common Interpre∣taion of the whole Church. So he. CHALLENGE. SVrely nor wee, without some one of these; but that you may know the grounds of our perswasion to be more than one, or yet all These; And how bountifully wee shall deale with you, wee shall shew in the Proposition following. Ten Reasons, for proofe of the Necessity of interpreting the words of Christ Figuratively. SECT. VI. FIrst, Wee have beene compellable to allow a Figurative Sense, by the confessed Analogie of Scripture, in all such Sa∣cramentall Speeches of both Testaments, concerning Circum∣cision, Rocke, Baptisme; as also that speech of Christ, Ioh. 6. Except you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, as you haveSee above c. 2. §. 3. heard. Secondly, Wee are Challengable hereunto by ourSee hereafter, B. . Chap. . § . Arti∣cle of Faith, which teacheth but one naturall Body of Christ, and the same to Remaine now in Heaven. Thirdly, Wee are in∣forced, for feare of suchSee hereafter, B. . Chap. 4. Heresies, as have followed in o∣ther Case, upon the literall sense; for it was not the Figura∣tive, but the literall and proper sense of being borne againe, by Baptisme, (Ioh. 3.) that begat the errour of Nicodemus: and the like literall sense of God's Eyes, Hands, Feet, &c. brought forth the Anthropomorphites. And so was it the literall sense of those words in the Canticles [Tell mee where thou lyest at noone] which deluded the Donatists; and of Origen you have heard, that hee by the literall sense of these wordes, [Some there be that castrate themselves, &c,] did fondly wrong him∣selfe. Fourthly, Wee are necessarily mooved, to reject your lite∣rall sense, by a confessed Impossibility, taught by that Vniversall Maxime,See above Chap. 1. §. 4. Disparatum de disparato, &c. shewing that Bread, being of a different nature from flesh, can no more possibly be called the flesh or Body of Christ, literally, than Leade can be called Wood. Fiftly, Wee are perswaded hereunto by the for∣mer alleaged Interpretation of the Ancient Fathers, both of the Greeke and Latine Church, calling the Sacrament a Figure; and expounding This is] by [This Signifieth.] Sixtly, Wee are urged by the Rule set downe by Saint Augustine, for the dire∣ction of the whole Catholike Church; that,Spraeceptiva locutio fgitium aut facinus videtur iube∣re, figurata est, ut [nisi manducaveritis car∣nem meam] facinus videtur jubere: ergo figura est, praecipiens passioni Domini est communicandum, & suaviter, ac utiliter recolendum in me∣moriâ, quià pro nbis caro ejus crucifixa, & vulnerata sit. August. de Doctrina Christ. lib 3. cap. 16. Whensoever the precept (saith he) seemeth to command that which is hainous (as to eate the flesh of Christ) it is figurative. And of this Sacrament
doth not Christ say, Take, Eate, This is my Body? Seventhly, A Motive it must needs be to any reasonable man, to defend the figurative sense, by observing the misery of your Dispu∣ters, in contending for a Literall Exposition therof; because their Objections have beene confuted by your owne Doctors, and by Truth it selfe, even the holy Scriptures. Eightly, your owne Vnreasonablenesse may perswade somewhat, who have not beene able, hitherto, to confirme any one of your five for∣mer Objections to the contrary, by any one Father of the Church. Ninthly, For that the literall Interpretation of Christ's wordes was the foundation of the Heresie of the Capernaites, and hath affinitie with divers otherSee the last Booke Chap. 2. §. the last. Ancient Heresies condemned by Antiquitie. Tenthly, Our last perswasion is the consent of Antiquity, against the Literall conversion of Bread into Christ's Body (which you call Transubstantiation) against the Literall Corporall Presence, against Literall Corpo∣rall Eating, and Vnion, and against a proper Sacrifice of Christ's Body Subjectively. All which are fully perswasive Inducements to inforce a figurative sense, as the sundry Bookes following will clearely demonstrate from point to point. CHALLENGE. YOu may not passe over the consideration of these points, by calling them Schoole-subtilties, and Logicall Differences, as Master Fisher lately hath done; thinking by this his flie Sophistrie, craftily to draw the mindes of Romish Professors from the due discovery of your Romish false Literall Expositi∣on of Christ's words, [THIS IS MY BODY:] the very foun∣dation of your manifold monstrously-Erroneous, Superstitious, Hereticall, and Idolatrous Consequences issuing from thence, whereunto wee now orderly proceed, after that wee have un∣foulded your last Mysterie.
CHAP. IIII. {fleur-de-lys}A Confirmation of a Figurative Sense of Christs words, [THIS IS MY BODY] opened unto us by a Third Key, in the Pronoune [MEVM] as it is pro∣nounced by the Romish Priest, in his Con∣secration; a Point as observable as any other. SECT. I. AN Objection there is, which so much per∣plexeth your Doctors, that both Repug∣nancie among themselves in Answering, and Insufficiencie of Answers, may justly seeme as good as their Prevaricating in the Cause. It is objected that the Minister can∣not pronounce these words of Christ [This is my Body] in the same proprietie of Speech, wherein Christ himselfe spake them; and therefore they cannot bee Consecrative words, according to your Romane Faith, as they are ut∣tered by the Minister. For hee must deliver them either, Narratively, by way of Repetition, as they are read, both in the Gospell, and in your Romane Missall saying, [And Iesus tooke Bread, and when hee had given thankes, he brake it, and gave it to his Disciples, saying, This is my Body.] And if so, then the Minister in rehearsing of Christs word [THIS] should consecrate the Bread, wherof Christ spake in his say∣ing, [THIS] at his Institution of this Sacrament, and not this Bread, which is now in the Ministers hand, made visible to the People. Or else he should pronounce the same words (according to your owne terme) Significatively, that is, so speaking them in the person of Christ, as if Christ himselfe should now pronounce them. And if so, then in the Priests saying [This is my Body,] the word [MY] should signifie the Body of the Priest, and not the Body of Christ. This is a shrewd Objection, which so puzleth your Doctors, (See the Bellarm. lib. 4. de Eucharist. cap. 14. §. Objicitur.—Possunt verba duo∣bus modis dici, aut Narrativè ac Recita∣tivè, vel Significativè: ut exempli gratia, cùm ex Evangelio recitamus dixisse Iu∣daeos de Christo [Hic blasphemat] illa verba [Hic blas∣phemat] à rudaeis di∣cebantur significati∣vè, id enim volebant, Christum esse Blasphemum; à nobis autem non dicuntur Significativè, sed tantum Nar∣rativè, non enim significare volumus Christum essè Blasphemum, sed Iudaeos hoc dixise. Hac distinctione positâ, est hoc Argu nentum: Verba illa [Hoc est Corpus mean] vel dicuntur à Sacerdotibus Recitativè, vel Significativè, sed neutro modo possunt esse forma Sacramenti, igitur non suntsta verba forma Sacramenti, Probatur Assumptio, Nam si ista verba dicerentur Recitativè, primò sequeretur per illùd [Hoc] demonstrari Panem, qui suit in manibus Christi, non istum, qui est in manbus Sacerdotis: ac proinde non consecraretur Panis, qui consecrandus proponitur in Altari. Secundò, sequeretur non posse consecrari quidquam his verbis; Nam verba consecrant dum faciunt quod significant, ista autem nihil significant, dum dicuntur materi. liter tantùm, & non Significativè. Si autem dicerentu Significativè, Primò, illud [Hoc est Corpus meum] demon∣straret corpus Sacerdotis, non Christi, ac dicere oportet, Hoc est corpus Christi—Respondeo, verba illa dici utroque modo, & Recitativè, & Significativè, in cujus rei gratia, notanda sunt tria. Primum, Sacerdos, quan∣do confitetur peccata sua, quando orat, quando laudat Christum, agit sine dubio personam suam, non Christi: quando dicit [Hoc est Corpus meum] agit personam Christi.—Secundum, In hac actione longè aliter Sacerdotem agere personam Christi, quàm in alijs Sacramentes: nam in alijs agit ut Christi minister, tamen loquitur in personâ suâ, ut cùm dicit, Ego te baptizo: Ego te absolvo.—at in Consecratione Eucha∣ristiae, Sacerdos non solùm agit ut Christi minister, sed induit omnino Christi personam, ac loquitur ac si ipse esset Christus: quomodò Exod. 3. Angelus dicit. [Ego sum Deus patris tui.] Tertium—Sacerdotem in actione Liturgiae, usque ad illa verba, Qui pridiè quàm pateretur, agere personam suam, non Christi: ut pa∣ret, quia cousque orat, vel laudat; ab illis autem verbis, usque ad finem Consecrationis, agere personam su∣am & Christi; & ideò Recitativè simul & Significativè verba pronuncare: intendit enim recitare qud Chri∣stus egerit, & dixerit, & simul omnia imitari in persona Christi, ac si Christus per ipsius mysterium iterum omnia faceret & diceret. Vasquez. in 3. Thom. Quaest. 78. Artic. 4. Disput. 200. cap. 1. Nonnulli existi∣mant a verba Recitativè sumi, Innocent 3. Durand. Major. Catharinus, Ledesma, Gabriel: Ratio, quia si Significativè tantùm, essent falsa, nihil significantia aliud in ore Sacerdotis, quàm in ore Christi, viz. Chri∣stum solu dixisse Apostolis, [Sumite, Bibite, &c.] Ad haec, quod si Significativè, tum minister non osten∣deret corpus Christi, sed suum, diceus [Meum,] quod esset falsum—Alij verò consent verba formae Con∣secrationis proferri à Sacerdote non solùm Significativè, & in persona Christi, sicut is qui in Comoedia induit personam Regis, aut alterius, assumens ejus verba, ea profert Significativè, & in persona illius, sed etiam Re∣citativè, quamvis non materialiter. Cap. 2. At mihi sanè prima opinio summopere displicuit, eo quod semper judicaverim nullâ ratione negari posse verba Consecrationis Significativè à Sacerdote usurpari; cùmque duo illi modi, nempe Recitativè, & Significativè, inter se pugnent, ut in eandem vocem, aut orationem convenire nequeant—Est igitur sententia (me quidem judice) probabilior, verba Consecrationis, quae sunt pro¦forma, Significativè solùm à Sacerdote proferri, non autem Recitativè, hoc est, Narrativè, tamedi in persona Christi ab eo efferantur—Atque huc spectat, quod Concilium Trident. câdem Sess. 13. cap 3. inquit, sub speciebùs panis solum esse corpus, ex vi verborum, na per vim verborum significationem eorum denotat. Et ita solum significent corpus, solum illud sub specie panis vi suâ constunt. Adde, haec duo inter se pugnant, nam Recitativè idem est quod referre alium illud dixisse, & eo aliquid significâsse: at qui refert verba alte∣rius, mendacium recitando dicta ejus mentiretur, sed is falsum dixit, non mendcum; & deinde si Recitativè, tum verba non pertinerent ad materiam praesentem. Et Cap. 3—Verba praecedentia solùm dicuntur Recitativè, ut attentum faciant Sacerdotem ipsum, & verba Consecranonis non ex proprio sensu, sed in perso∣na, & sensi Christi, ac si ille praesens esser, cùm reverà illius vicem serat, proximè pronuntiet: veluti si quis volens repraesentare personam Regis, historicè referat aliqua facta ipsius, ut statim nomine ejus Significat. vè incipiat loqui. Participium autem [Dicens] quod refertur etiam ad verba Consecrationis, non essicit ut illa Recitativè dicantur, sed & nomine illius, qui ea tunc dixit, pronuntientur; atque de hoc tantum per illud Par∣ticipium [Dicens] admonemur. Marginalls) that they bestirre themselves like as Soul∣diers would doe, in withstanding a Batterie, or defending a Breach. One company of them say, that the Priest utte∣reth Christs words onely Narratively by rehearsing them; A second ranke answers no, but both Recitingly, and Signi∣ficatively.
Not so, saith the Third Troope, because this is Impossible. Thus much of the irresolute Iudgements of your Disputers. That the Answeres given are each of them Insufficient. The first is, that the Priest pronounceth Christs words both Narratively, and Significatively. SECT. II. BEllarmine and Vasquez perceiving that if the Minister should deliver these words of Christ [This is my Body]
onely as Narratively, rehearsing them, then hee could not therby consecrate the Bread, which is in his owne hands, be∣cause it is not that Bread, which was then in Christs hands, when he sayd [This is my Bodie.] And againe, if they should be uttered of the Priest, as in the person of Christ, which you call Significatively, as if Christ himselfe should now speake them, by the mouth of the Priest; yet being Pro∣nounced by the Priest, and not by Christ, the Priest in say∣ing, [My Bodie,] should consecrate his owne Bodie, and not the Bodie of Christ. They doe therefore assume and conclude, that the Priest uttereth these words both Mate∣rially and Formally, that is, both Narratively, repeating them as the Minister of Christ; and Significatively, pro∣nouncing them in the person of Christ. If they could illustrate this to be possible by any Similitudes, wee should more easily beleeve them, but they cannot. Let us try this. Bellarmine.See above in the former Section. It is (saith hee in the Margin) as when the Angell of God, taking upon him the person of God, said, [I am the God of your Fathers.] So hee. Wee (not to dispute now the truth of his Assertion, in saying it was Gods Angell that sayd, I am the God of your Fathers, but to sup∣pose it true) doe reply, that the Similitude is not appliable: Because, if as the Priest repeating Christs words thus, [Iesus gave it to his Disciples, saying, [This is my Bodie;] So the Angell of God should have said, God speaketh unto you, say∣ing, [I am the God of your Fathers;] Every one at the first hearing would easily discerne that the Angell spake so, only as a Minister, or (as the word, Angell, signifieth) a Messen∣ger of God, and not as the person of God. Your Iesuite Suarez will mend this, who, to shew that a man may, in the same words, speake, both in his owne per∣son, and in the person of another,Suarez in 3. Thom. Disp. 58. §. 4 Non tantùm Recita∣tivè, sed etiam for∣maliter & Significa∣tivè proferuntur sig∣nificando.—quià ut verba efficiant consecrationem prae∣sentis materiae, opor∣tet ut illa verba sig∣nificent, alioqui non efficiunt, ut ait Tho∣mas: ulterius dici possit, si solùm materialiter proferentur, ex veritate illorum non posset colligi, Hoc, quod nunc est in manibus Sacerdotis, esse verum corpus Christi, quià illa hoc non significant—non potest colligi ex hoc, quòd Christus ea form. litèr protulit, nec ex facto Christi—Cum dicit Conc. Tridentinum ex veritate verborum Christi colligi ejus praesentiam: non loquitur tantùm de verbis, ut à Christo prolata sunt, sed ut à Sacerdote proferuntur. Christus (ait Chrysost.) per os Sacerdotis loquitur: et Ambrosius, non  utitur Sacerdos verbis suis, sed Christi—Et (aliquanto post) praecedentia & subsequentia tantùm ma∣terialiter proferuntur, at illa verba etiam Significativè propter mysterium, possit enim quis loqui vel in persona sua, vel aliena—ut si Regium Concilium Sententiam proferat his vel similibus verbis; Nobis injunctum est, ut Sententiam proferamus, dicentes: [Ego Rex in hac causa dico.] It is (saith hee) as if a Councell of some King should say, It is given us in charge to pronounce Sentence, saying, [I the King doe say in this Cause, &c.] So farre your Iesuite, and no farther. We Reply: That the point, which is to be proved, is, that the same words may bee spoken of the same man, both in his owne person and in the person of another. But when the Councell sayd, [It is gi∣ven us in charge that I doe say in this cause] they saying, It is
given us in charge, spake it in their owne person, and not in the person of the King; for the Charge was not given to the King, but by the King to themselves. And when they said, [I the King doe say in the Cause] they spake not in their owne person, but in the person of the King. What need many words? To speake the same words in a mans owne person, and n the person of another (saith your Iesuit Vasquez i the Murgi, and that most trulie) is Impossible; and hee therefore stan∣deth onely to that one Tere, Significatively, which all your other Disputers held to bee necessarie for the Answe∣ring of the maine Objection. But what need wee any Iesuit to plead our Cause, seeing that the Text it selfe will cleare∣lie evince the same? That the words of Christ, as they are pronounced by the Priest, are meerely Narrative, and not Significa∣tive, is proved by the Text it selfe. SECT. III. IT was alwayes held, by all Divines, to bee a most ne∣cessary, exact, and securo Rule of interpreting of Scrip∣ture, to expound a Text by the Context of the words pre∣ceding, and the words following, Ianus wise, looking . The words of the first Text are these, This is my Body:] of the Second these, [ For this is the New Testament in my Blood] as Saint Matthew hath it. Now the words which goe immediately before the former Text, concerning the Acts of Christ, viz. [He (having taken Bread) when hee had given thankes, brake it, saying, This is, &c.] are delivered by the Minister onely Narratively, namely, rehearsing what Christ had done long since; and not any Act now in doing by the Priest, in the person of Christ. The words likewise preceding, in the Second Text, concer∣ning the Cup, stand thus: [After Hee (Christ) had supped, hee tooke the Cup, and when hee had given thankes, hee sayd, Drinke you all of this, &c.] which all are Narratives, re∣pearing what Christ had done. For the words are, HEE (Christ) TOOKE; and not, I, the Minister: And HEE, what? [Saying,] a word Narrative, in it's owne proper Sig∣nification. Next marke the succeeding words of both your supposed Consecratory Sayings of Christ, concerning the Bread [This is my Bodie:] it followeth, HEE (Christ) taking the Cup: as likewise secondly concerning the Cup, the words
succeeding, which are [SHED, for Remission of sins] are a Narration of the virtue of Christs Blood Shed, expressed then by Christ. We now demand, seeing the whole Contexture, whether going before, or following after the Text in Controver∣sie, are all words, onely rehearsing what Christ had done; why should you conceive the Intervenient words [This is my Bodie] to be uttered in a different tenure of speech, as in the person of Christ? When wee should expect some warrant hereof from some one Father, you are unanimously mute. When wee further inquire into your Reason, wee finde none more semblable than this, That (according to your familiar, and frequent Similitude of a Stage-Play) your Priest is here (as it were) Acting in a Play, and exchanging his Parts, now and then taking upon him the person of a Re∣lator, and Rehearser onely; and againe, in a middle Scene, of a Significator. That the Suggested Romish Significative Sense of Christ's words was never Patronized by any Ancient Father. SECT. IV. VVEe willingly grant, that the Apostle, speaking of Absolution, 2 Cor. 2. saith, If I have pardoned any thing, I have pardoned in the person of Christ; And againe, 2 Cor. 5. Wee are Embassadors for Christ, exhorting you in Christ's stead. But these, and the like words of the Apostle, have no other meaning than that which your owneEstius Pro∣fessor Theol. Duacen. in 2. Cor. 2. v. 10. [Cui quid donav in persona Christi do∣navi] posset ae{que} ver∣ti [In facie Christi] quasi coram Christo, & in ejus praesentia—et infia in hac eâdem Epistolà ca 4. legur in [persona] ubi nos habemus [In facie Christi] & iur∣sus cap. 5. , ubi latinè [Qui in facie] gloriantur, id est, in his qui ex∣terius apparent—Hoc autem in [per∣sona Christi] nihil est aliud quam in vice, & nomine, & authoritate Christi.—Theodoret. tanquam [intuente Christo] Theoph. [coram Christo] hoc est Christo jubente, & veluti ejus loco existens, & veluti ejus personam referens. Chrysost. Id est, tanquam Christo hoc jubente. Nos sensum reddamus verborum Apo∣stoli, facio tanquam Christi minister & Delegatus, cujus ineare personam refero. Salmoron in eum locum. Vice Christi, & ad gloriam Christi. Idem in 2 Cor. 5. Pro Christo legatione fungimur, tanquàm Deo exhor∣tante per nos: Id est, Lgatione fungunur vice Christi—Sensus est, cum nos legatione fungimur, exhor∣tando, obsecrando vos, ut per poenitentiam reconciliemini Deo, sic accipre debetis, ac si Deus exhortetur pernos. Ie∣suite Estius rendreth out of the Fathers. [In the person of Christ] is no more (saith he) but in the name of Christ, and by the authoritie of Christ, and as Christ himselfe commanding me, and beholding me, I being the Minister of Christ. But the Priest, in pronouncing the words of Christ, in the Romish Significative sense, is said to do it in a farre higher straine; which your Cardinall Bellarmine will have you to consider, See above Sect. 1. The Priest (saith he) in this Action (of Consecration) dea∣leth farre otherwise, than he doth in other Sacraments, where he speaketh as the Minister of God, in his owne person, saying, [I Absolve thee: I Baptize thee.] Do you marke? [Farre
otherwise.] And yet the Apostle, when hee spake of the Absolution, which hee gave, saying to the Corinthians, If I have pardoned any, hee added, [I have pardoned them in the person of Christ.] So that the word [Person,] spoken of by the Apostle, and Ancient Fathers, is to be understood [Farre otherwise] than that which the Significative Romish sense doth exact; which is, that the Priest so uttereth Christ's words, in the person of Christ, that he delivereth them Significatively, that is, as to signifie the same Intenti∣on in himselfe, in repeating those words, which Christ him∣selfe had in the first uttering of them. As for example, (it is your Cardinal's owne) Any one repeating these words spoken of the wicked Iewes, Saying con∣cerning Christ [This man Blasphemeth] if he should utter them Significatively, that is, with the same Intention of noting Christ to be a blasphemer, he himselfe should Blaspheme: ut delivering them onely Narratively, by way of Repetition, hee doth not Blaspheme, because he meaneth not to say that Christ did Blaspheme, but that the Iewes said so. So he. And so say wee, That the Priest, in repeating of Christ's words [This is my Body] pronounceth them Narratively onely, and not Significatively. For the Romish Priest, if he should speake the words of Christ Significatively, in the person of Christ, that is, with the same Intention as Christ, when hee said [This] of the Bread, then in his hands: the Priest saying, [This] should intead and meane that [This Bread] whereof Christ spake, and not that which is in his owne hands, which now he intendeth to Consecrate; and Consequent∣ly should he make no Consecration at all. And what here∣upon must become of your Romish Masse, in your Transub∣stantiation, Sacrifice, and Adoration, you may understand in the next Section. The full Overthrow of the whole Doctrine of Transubstantiation, Corporall Presence, Personall Sacrifice, and Adoration, Consequently, upon the former Confutation of your Romish Significative Pronunciation of Christ's words by the Priest. SECT. V. TRuly hath your IesuiteSee above in the Second Section. Suarez expressed the Doctrine of your Church, as followeth; Except these words This is my Body] be taken Significatively, and formally, they worke no Consecration, nor can it be collected, that that which is now in the hands of the Priest, is the true Body of Christ. So he; alleging the Couacel of Trent for his warrant. But the
words, as they are pronounced by the Priest, cannot pos∣sibly be taken Significatively, but onely in the way of Re∣hearsing and Repeating them; No one Iota in the Text, or Context; No one Testimonie of Antiquitie; No one Rea∣son, or yet competent Example hath beene alleged by any of your Doctors for proofe of the Contrary. This point needeth no more discussion, onely, for further Illustration-sake, wee shall commend unto you a more pro∣portionable Example, than was any that hitherto your So∣phisters have invented; which, because your Iesuites have affected theSee above in the first and second Secti∣ons. Similitudes of Historicall and Comicall Represen∣tations, wee shall likewise borrow from that Stage. If there∣fore any Romish Priest should Act the part of Aäron, in imi∣tating an operative Speech of turning and Transubstantia∣ting a Rod into a Serpent, in saying (to suppose Aäron to have said so) [This is my Serpent] yet could not your Priest possi∣bly deliver the same words Significatively, as in the person of Aäron; either in saying [This] because, This Rod, spoken of by the Priest, is not the same Rod, whereof Aäron said [This:] nor yet in the word [My] because that, wherof Aä∣ron said, [My Serpent] cannot possibly bee said accordingly [My Serpent] by the Priest, as your selves well know. And therefore doth this discover your Romish Intoxication, in your Significative Ex∣position of these words [This] and [My] in the Speech of Christ.
THE THIRD BOOKE, Treating of the First Romish Doctrinall Consequence, pretended to arise from your former depraved Exposi∣tion of Christ's wordes. [This is my Body.] called TRANSVBSTAN∣TIATION. Your Doctrinall Romish Con∣sequences are Five, viz. the Corporall 1. Conversion of the Bread into the Body of Christ, called Transubstantiation; in this Third Booke. 2. Existence of the same Body of Christ in the Sacrament, called Corporall Presence; in the Fourth Booke. 3. Receiving of the Body of Christ into the Bodies of the Communicants, called Reall, or Materiall Conjunction; in the Fifth Booke. 4. Sacrificing of Christ's Body, by the hands of the Priest, called a Propitiatory Sacrifice; in the Sixth Booke. 5. Worshipping with Divine Worship, cal∣led Latria, or Divine Adoration of the same Sacrament; in the Seventh Booke. After follow the Additionals, in a Summary Disco∣verie of the Abominations of the Romish Masse, and the Iniquities of the Defenders thereof; in the Eighth Booke. THese are the five Doctrinall Consequences, which you teach, and professe, and which wee shall (by God's assistance) pursue, according to our former Me∣thod of Brevity, and Perspicuity; and that by as good, and undenyable Evi∣dences, and Confessions of your owne Authours, in most points, as either you can expect, or the Cause it selfe require. And because a Thing must have a Begetting, before it have a manner of Being, there∣fore
before wee treate of the Corporall Presence, wee must in the first place handle your Transubstantiation, which is the man∣ner (as wee may so say) of the Procreation thereof. CHAP. I. The State of the Controversie, concerning the Change and Conversion professed by Protestants, which is Sa∣cramentall; And by the Papists defined to be Trans-substantiall. First of the Sacramentall. SECT. I. THere lyeth a charge upon every Soule, that shall communicate and participate of this Sacrament, that herein hee Discerne the Lords Body: which Office of Discerning (according to the judgement of Protestants) is not onely in the use, but also in the Nature to distinguish the Object of Faith, from the Object of Sense. The First Object of Christian Faith, is the Divine Alteration, and Change of naturall Bread, into a Sacrament of Christs Bodie. This wee call a Divine Change, because none but the sameSee hereafter, Chap. 4. §. 1. & 2. Omnipotent power, that made the Creature and Element of Bread, can Change it into a Sacrament. The Second Object of Faith, is the Body of Christ it selfe, Sa∣cramentally represented, and verily exhibited to the Faithfull Communicants. There are then three Objects, in all, to be di∣stinguished. The First is before Consecration, the Bread meerely Naturall. Secondly, After Consecration, Bread Sacramentall. Thirdly, Christs owne Body, which is the Spirituall, and Super∣substantiall Bread, truly exhibited by this Sacramentall, to the nourishment of the soules of the Faithfull. Secondly of the Romish Change, which you call Transubstantiation. SECT. II. BVt your Change in the Councell ofEst conversio totius substantiae Pa∣nis in Corpus Chri∣sti, & totius substantiae Vini in sanguinem, manentibus duntaxat speciebus Panis, & Vini, quam quidem Con∣versionem Catholica Ecclesia aptissimè Transubstantiationem appellat. Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 2. Trent is thus defi∣ned: Transubstantiation is a Change of the whole Substance
of Bread into the Body of Christ, and of Wine into his Blood. Which by the Bull ofEgo N.

Roffens. Episc. con. Capt. Bab. cap. 9. pag. 99. Roffensis giveth his consent. Secondly, (which is also confessed) some other Doctors of your Church, because they could not find so full Evidence, for proofe of your Transubstantiation, out of the words of Christ, were driven to so hard shifts, as to[Hoc est] pro Transit, Bonaventu∣ra decet.

Change the Verbe Sub∣stantive [Est] into a Verbe Passive, or Transitive, Fit, or Tran∣sit; that is, in stead of [Is] to say, It's Made, or It passeth into the Body of Christ. A Sense, which your Iesuite Suarez can∣not allow, because (as hee truly saith) It is a Corrupting of the Text. Albeit indeed this word, Transubstantiation, importeth no more than the Fieri, seu Transire, of Making, or Passing of one Substance into another. So that still you see Transubstantiation cannot bee extracted out of the Text, without violence to the words of Christ. {fleur-de-lys}The like violence is used by your IesuitIac. Gordon Scotus Ies. lib. Controv. 4. cap 3. n. 15. Propositiones practicae proferuntur per verba praesentis tem∣poris, non futuri, ut certi  de effectuve borum. Haec verba [Hoc est corpus meum] practica sunt, efficiunt quod significant: [Mandu ex hoc, Bibite ex hoc] ubique demonstrat corpus Christi futurum, vel sanguinem ejus futorum. Similis statuitur verbis Consecrationis, alioqui ista communio esset merè specu∣lativa, non practica. Gordon, who, to make Christs Speech to be Practicall, for working a Transub∣stātiation, doth inforce the words [This is my Body] and, [Eat yee this] and, [Drinke yee this] being all spoken in the Pre∣sent tense, to signifie the future. Which, although it were true, all Grammarians know to be the figure Enallage. From these Premisses it is most apparent, that the Romish Doctors cast themselves necessarily upon the hornes of this Dilēma, thus: Either have these words of Christ [This is my Body] a Sense Practicall, to signifie that which they worke, and then is the Sense Tropicall, (as you have now heard them, against your Romish Literall Sense, to betoken an operative power and effect of working Bread into the Body of Christ:) or else they are not Practicall; and then they cannot implie your Tran∣substantiation at all. Wee might, in the third place, adde hereunto that the true Sense of the words of Christ is Figurative, as by Scriptures, Fathers, and by your owne confessed Grounds hath beene al∣ready plentifullySee the former Booke throughout. proved, as an insallible Truth. So ground∣lesse
is this chiefe Article of your Romish Faith, whereof more will be said in the sixt Section following. But yet, by the way, wee take leave to prevent your Objection. You have told us thatSee the former Booke throughout. the words of Christ are Operative, and worke that which they signifie; so that upon the pronunciation of the words [This is my Body,] it must infallibly follow, that Bread is changed into Christs Body; which wee shall beleeve, assoone as you shall bee able to prove, that upon the pronuntiation of the other words of Christ [This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood,] Luke 22. 20. the Cup is changed into the Testament of Christs Blood, or else into his Blood it selfe. The Noveltie of Transubstantiation examined, as well for the Name, as for the Nature thereof. SECT. II. The Title, and Name of Transubstantiation proved to be of a latter date. YOu have imposed the very Title of Transubstantiation upon the Faith of Christians; albeit the word, Transub∣stantiation (as you grant)Fateor, neque Antiquos Patres u∣sos esse hoc nomi∣ne Transubstantiati∣onis. Christoph. de Capite fontium, Ar∣chicpis. Caesar. lib. de reali praesen. cap. 5. 9. Artic. 4. was not used of any Ancient Fathers; and that your Romish Change had not it's Christendome, or name among Christians to be called Transubstantiation (as your CardinallConcilium La∣teranense sub Inno∣centio Tertio coa∣ctum, ut Haereticis os obthurarer, Con∣versionem hanc novo & valdè significance verbo dixit Transub∣stantiationem. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 34. pag. 422. As for that objected place out of Cyrill of Alexandria Epist ad Caelosyrium [Convertens ea in veritatem Carnis:] It is answered by Vasquez the Iesuite; non habetur illa E∣pistola inter opera Cyrilli. Vasquez. in 3. Thom. Tom. 3. num. 24. Alan witnesseth) before the Councell of Laterane, which was 1 15. yeares after Christ; nor can you produce One Father Greeke or Latine, for a Thousand yeares, attributing any word equivalent, in strict Sense, unto the same word Tran∣substantiation, untill the yeare 900 (which is beyond the Com∣passe of due Antiquitie.) At what time you finde, note, and urge Theophylact, who saith of the Bread, that It is Trans-elementated into the Body of Christ. Which Phrase, in what Sense hee used it, you might best have learned from himselfe, who in the ve∣ry same place saith that Christ in a manner isTheoph. in Ioh. 6. De Christo per sidem manducato: [] Trans-elemen∣tated into the Communicant: which how unchristian a Paradox it were, being taken in strict and proper Sense, we permit to your owne judgements to determine. Neither yet may you, for the countenancing of the Noveltie of this word, object the like use of this word [] as though it had beene in use before the Arian Controversie began: because the Fathers of the Councell of Nice judged the Objection of the Noveltie of that word Calumnious; for that
the use of it had beene Ancient before their times, as your Car∣dinall Calumniam hanc Patres Antique aptissimè cōtutârunt, at{que} ostenderunt non inventum fuisse hoc nomen [] in Concilio Nicaeno, sed fuisse antè in usu Patrum; at illud jam vocabulum usurpari, quo sui Majores usi fuissent. Bellarm. quo supra. c. 3. Bellarmine himselfe witnesseth. You furthermore, to prevent our Objection (demanding why the Ancient Fathers never called your fancied Romish Change, Transubstantiation, if they had beene of your Romish Faith, concerning the Substantiall Change of Bread into the Body of Christ) have shaped us this Answer, namely, thatEts: veteres Ec∣clasiae Doctores non sint usi voce Tran substantrationis, ta∣men usi sunt vocibus icē significantibus, ut Conversionis, Trās∣mutationis, Transi tionis, Transforma∣tionis, Transelemen∣tationis, & silibus  Fortit. jd Tract. de Euchari, §. Nota pro solouo∣ne Agumentorum. sol. 117. Although they used not the very word, Transubstantiation, yet have they words of the same signification, to wit, Conversion, Transmutation, Transition, Transformation, Trans-elementation, and the like. So your Lorichius Reader of Divinitie among you; who by his vast and rash boldnesse might as justly have inferred from the like Phrases of the Apostle, viz, [2. Cor. 3. 18. , we are transformed] that every Regenerate Christian is Transubstanti∣ated into Christ: or, from the word [2. Cor. 1. 14. , He is trans∣figured] say that the Divell is Transubstantiated into an Angel of light: or from the word [, It is changed] (used by Quiaquid Spi∣ritus Sanctus tetige∣rit, & Sanctificat . Cyril. Hieros. . 5. Cyrill) urge that whosoever the Spirit of God doth Sanctifie, is Transubstantiated into another thing: or from the word [] in. Na∣zianz. Orat. 40 pag. 943. Edit. Paris. Nazianzene, conclude that Every per∣son Baptized is Transubstantiated into Christ. {fleur-de-lys}And one of your owne Doctors examining all the Phrases of the Greeke Fathers, and comming to the word,  (which doth properly expresse the sense of the Latine word, Transubstan∣tiatio) hee confesseth thatQuanvis Grae∣ci Petres eo nomine  non utun∣tur, sunt tamen Au∣thores aborum no , quibus eam, quoac hert possit, ap & exprimunt, ut  &c. Petrus Aread de concord O∣rient. & Occident. Eccl. lib. 3 c. 2 Tract. de Euch. They used it not. And what the Greek Church thinketh thereof, at this day, you may learne from two Patriarchs of Constantinople; the One not admit∣ting, the Other rejecting it; as will bee showne in the second Chapter. Will you have the World imagine that so many, so excel∣lent, and so Ancient Fathers, with all that Divine and Humane Learning wherewith they were so admirably accomplished, could not, in a Thousand yeares space, finde out either the Greeke word, , or the Latine Transubstantiatio, and apply them to this Change, if they had once dreamed of this your Article of Faith? Will you permit us to learne a point of wisedome from your Cardinall?Periculosa est vocum novarum Li∣bertas in Ecclesia, cum paulatim ex vo∣cibus novis novae etiam res oriantor, cùm cui{que} licet in tel us  nomina singere.

Therefore may we justly place this your new word among those , which Saint1. Tim. c. 20. Paul will have Christians by all meanes to avoid; else so new and barbarous a Name must needs ingender a novel, and brutish opinion, such as this Article it selfe will appeare to be; As followeth.
The Noveltie of the Article of Transubstantiation is examined, and showne not to have beene before the Councel of Laterane (namely) not untill 1215. yeares after Christ. SECT. III. THis Article hath beene decreed (as you haveSee above Ch. 1. §. 2. heard) by your Church, as a necessary Doctrine of Faith; and there∣fore presumed to be Ancient. CHALLENGE. THe first Imposition of this Article, as of Faith, your Car∣dinall Bellar. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 23. §. Vnum tamen. Bellarmine noteth to have beene in the dayes of Pope Gregory the Seventh. viz. 1073. yeares after Christ. But surely at that time this could be but a private opinion of some few, for Peter Lombard (living 67. yeares after this Pope, and esteemed the Master of the Romish Schoole) when he had labou∣red to give Resolution to all doubts, especially in this very Que∣stion (whether the Conversion were substantiall, or not) confesseth plainely, saying;Si quaeratur, qua∣lis sit Conversio (viz. Pants in Encharistia) an formalis, an sub∣stantialis, an alteri∣us generis; definite non sufficio. Quibus∣dum videtur esse sub∣stantialis, dicentibus substantiam converti in substantiam. Lom∣bard. Sent. lib. 4 Di∣stinct 11 lit. (a.) Definire non sufficio: I am not able to De∣termine. So he. Anno. 1140. Hitherto therefore this Article was but in Conception onely, which caused your learned and Subtile School-man Scotus to de∣scend lower, to finde out the Birth thereof,Scotus dicit an∣te Concilium Late∣ranense non fuisse dogma fidei Tran∣substantiationem. Id ille dixit, quia non legerat Conc. Rom. sub Gregorib. 7. nec consensum Patrum, quem nos produxi∣mus. Bellarm. lib 3. de Eucharist. cap. 23. §. Vnum tamen. Affirming that the Article of Transubstantiation was no Doctrine of Faith before the Councel of Laterane, under Pope Innocent the Third, viz. An∣no 1215 whom therefore your Cardinall doth taxe for want of reading. But either were your Iesuite Coster, and Cardinall Perron as ignorant of Ancient Learning, as Scotus, or else they gave small Credit to that Councel cited by Bellarmine under Gre∣gory the Seventh. For your Iesuite saith, in direct tearmes, that Ante trecentos Annos in Concilio Lateranensi, ad ifri∣us rei tam admirabi∣lis clariorem expli∣carionem, usurpatem fuit nomen Transub∣stantiationis: ut in∣telligant Christiani substantiam Panis in substantiam corporis Christi converti. Coster. Ies. Enchir. cap 8. §. De Transubstanti∣tione. The name of Transubstantiation was used in the Councel of Laterane, for a clearer explication, that Christians might under∣stand the Change of Bread into the Body of Christ. Can you say then that it was universally so understood before? But your Cardinall Perron more peremptorily concludeth, thatSi nihil planè ad Doctrinam Ecclesiasticam spectans in Concilio Lateranensi ex communi Pa∣trum assensu decretum esset, sequeretur posse ut falsum impugnari Articulum de Transubstantiatione. Cardie. Per. en sa Harangue an tiers Estat pag. 33. [As witnesseth our P. Presloa, alias Widdington Discuss, Concib. Latcran. part. 1. §. 1. pag. 12.] If it had not beene for the Councel of Laterane, it might be now lawfull to impugne it. So he. A plaine acknowledgement, that it was no Doctrine of Faith before that Councel, even as Scotus affir∣med before. But we pursue this Chase yet further, to shew,
That the Article of Transubstantiation was not defined in the Councel of Laterane, under Pope inno∣centius the Third. SECT. IV. YOur owne learned RomishVenêre multa in Consultationem, nec decerni quicquam ta∣men aptè potuit, eò quòd Pontifex (quo profectus est tollen∣dae Discordiae gratiâ) mortuus est Petusij.

Thus farre out of Widdrington alias Preston, in his Booke above cited. Priest, a long time Prisoner, did (under the name of Widdrington) produce many Hi∣storians, viz. Platina, Nauclerus, Godfridus Monumetensis, Mat∣thew Paris, and others, to testifie as followeth: That many things fell under Consultation in that Councel, but nothing was openly defined, the Pope dying at Perusium. Insomuch that some of these Authours sticke not to say, that This Generall Councel, which see∣med to promise bigge and mighty matters, did end in scorne and mockery, performing nothing at all. Wee might adde, that the supposed Acts of this Councel were not published untill more than two hundred yeares after. No marvell then if some Scholastici quidam hanc Doctrinam de Transubstantiatione non valdè Antiquam esse dixerunt: inter quos Scorus, & Gabriel Biel. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 30. §. 1. Schoole-men, among whom were Scotus and Biel, held Transubstantiation not to have beene very ancient. And another, thatIn Synaxi serò definivit Ecclesia Transubstantiationem: diù satis erat Credere sivè sub pane, sive sub quocunque modo adesse verum Corpus Christi. Eras. in 1. Cor. 7. pag. 373. It was but lately determined in the Church. Nay, Ma∣ster Brerely (if his opinion be of any Credit among you) stick∣eth not to say thatMr. Brerely in his Liturgie Tract. 2. §. 11. pag. 158. Transubstantiation compleat (that is, both for forme, and matter) was not determined untill the last Coun∣cel of Trent; that is to say, not untill the yeare of our Lord, 1560. Do you not see how much licking this ougly Beare had, before it came to be formed? and yet it will appeare to be but a Monstrum horrendum, take it at the best; as it is now to be proved, by the full discovering of the paipable Falshood thereof.
CHAP. III. The Definition of Transubstantiation in the Church of Rome; and of the Falshood thereof. SECT. I. THe Councel of Trent (saith yourConcil. Tri∣dentinum dicit, fieri Conversionem toti∣us substantiae Panis, id est, tam formae quàm materiae in Substantiam Corporis Christi. Bellarmia. lib. 3. de Eucharist. Cap. 18. §. Si objicias. Concil. Trident. Sess. 13. Cap. 4. Cardinall) hath de∣fined that this Conversion is of the whole Substance of Bread, that is, aswell forme, as matter, into the Sub∣stance of Christ's Body. Our First proofe of the Falshood of the Doctrine of Tran∣substantiation, by the Contradictions of the Defen∣ders thereof; whereby they bewray their No-Beleefe of the Article. THe Opinions of the Doctours of your Church, concer∣ning the nature of this Conversion, are by you reduced in∣to these two maners, (namely) that it is either by Production out of the substance of Bread: or else by Adduction of the Body of Christ unto the forme of Bread. CHALLENGE. VVHatsoever it is, which you will seeme to professe, ne∣ver shall you perswade us that you do indeed believe either of the pretended Formes of Transubstant ation. First, not by Production, because (as the sameProductio est, quando terminus ad quem non existat, & ideò vi Conversionis necessariò produci∣tur, ut aqua in vi∣num. Adductiva au∣tem, &c. Bellar. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 18. §. Secundò notan∣dum.—Producti∣va non est, quia Cor∣pas Domini praeexistit. Idem. ibid. §. Ex his. Cardinall truly argu∣eth) Conversion by Production is, when the thing that is produced is not yet extant: as when Christ converted water into wine, wine was not Extant, before it was Produced out of the substance of wa∣ter. But the Body of Christ is alwaies Extant; therefore can it not be said to be Produced out of the substance of Bread. So he. Which Productive maner of Transubstantiation could not be believed by your Iesuites,De ratione Transubstantiationis non est, ut Substan∣tia, in quam dicitur fieri Transubstantirio, producatur, aut conservetur per illam: imo qui hoc modo defen∣dunt Transubstantiationem in Sacramento, ad quoddam genus Philosophiae excogitatum, potius quàm ad verum & necessarium, rem reducere videntur. Vasq. Ies. Tom. 2. Disp. 214. cap. 4. Vasquez, andPraeter Adductivam Conversionem evidenter refutavimus omnes modos Conversionis, qui vel dici, vel singi possunt. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Qu est. 75.

[Mr Fisher in his Rejòynder talketh fondly of a Re∣production, as of Carcasses converted into men, in which Change any One may see, that as much as is Pro∣duced is not Extant, for Dust is not Flesh. But since hee cannot apply this Reproduction to Transubstantiation of Bread into the Body of Christ, his Answe impertinent, and hee may be produced for an idle Disputer.] Suarez, by
both whom it hath beene confuted. And if the Change be not by Production, then it must follow that it is not by Transubstan∣tiation; which is demonstrable in it selfe, because the next maner, which they insist upon, cannot possibly serve your turne. This Sècond maner they name to bee by Adduction, which yourSi terminus ad quem Corpus Chri∣sti existat, sed non in eo loco ubi Ter∣minus à quo (id est, Panis) tum vi Con versionis adducetur ad eum locum. Inde vocatur Conversio adductiva: nam cor∣pus Christi praeexi∣stit  Conversio∣nem; sed non sub spe∣ciebus Panis. Con versio igitur non fe∣cit ut corpus Chri∣sti simpliciter esse in∣cipiat, sed ut incipiat esse sub speciebus: non quod per motum localem è Coelo Ad∣ducatur, sed solùm quia per hanc con∣versionem fit, ut quod ante erat solùm in Coelo, jam sit sub speciabus Panis. Nec haec accidentalis con∣versio, sed substanti∣alis dicta est, quia substantia Panis de∣sinit esse, & substan∣tia corporis Christi succedit Pani. Proin∣dè Substantia in Sub∣stantiam transit. Ta∣lis est Conversio Ci∣bi in hominem, per nutritionem; nam anima non produci∣tur, sed tantùm per nutritionem sit, ut in∣cipiat esse in ea ma∣teria, ubi antea erat forma Cibi. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 18. Cardinall defineth to be a Bringing of the Substance of that Body of Christ, continuing still in heaven, to be notwithstan∣ding at the same time under the shapes of Bread on the Altar: and therefore called Substastiall, because the Substance of Bread ceaseth to have any Being, en the Body of Christ succeedeth to be under the outward shapes of Bread. So he. And this is of late crept in∣to the opinion of some few, whereby you have created a new faith, flat contrary to the faith of the Councel of Trent, which defined a Change of the whole substance of Bread into the Body of Christ. So that Councel, as you have heard. Now by the Change of Substance into Substance, as when Common Bread, ea∣ten, is turned into the Substance of Man's flesh, the matter of Bread, is made the matter of flesh. But this your Adduction, is so farre from bringing in the Substance of Bread, Into the Sub∣stance of Christ's Body, that it professeth to bring the Body of Christ, not so much as unto the Bread, but to be under onely the Outward Accidents, and formes of Bread. Yet had this Fig∣ment some Favourers in yourFuerunt hujus sententiae Alens. Bonavent. Marsil.—Dicunt per hanc Conversionem Corpus non accipere esse, sed accipere esse hîc; nec multum discordat Thomas.

No Marvell therefore if there arose some out of your owne Church, who did impugne this delusion, calling it (as your Dixi Conversionem Panis in cor∣pas Christi esse Adductivam, quod dictum video à nonnullis esse perperàm acceptum, qui inde non Transubstan∣tiarionem, sed Translocationem colligunt. Sed dixi corpus Christi non deseruisse locum suum in Coelo, neque incipere esse sub speciebus, ut in loco, sed ut Substantia sub Accidentibus, remotâ tamen inhurentia. Bellarmia. Recog. in lib. 3. de Eucharist. pag. 81. Cardinall himselfe witnesseth of them) a Translocation one∣ly, and not a Transubstantiation; and that truly, if they should not have called it a Trans-accession, or Trans-succession rather. For who will say, if he put on his hand a Glove, made of a Lamb-skin, which Lambe was long since dead (and consequent∣ly ceasing to be) that therefore his hand is Transubstantiated into the Body of the Lambe? yet is there in this example a more substantiall Change, by much, than can be imagined to be by your Adduction of a Body under onely the Formes and Acci∣dents of the matter of Bread; because (to speake from your selves) there is in that a Materiall Touch betweene the Sub∣stance
of the hand, and the Lamb-skin: but in this other there is onely a Conjunction of the Substance of one Body with the Accidents of another. Which kinde of meere Succession of a Substance, your Iesuite Suarez will allow to bee no more than a Per solum Ad∣ductiram actionem reverà non explicatur vera conversio Sub∣stantialis, & Tran∣substantiatio, sed tantùm Transloca∣tio quaedam: quan∣do una Substantia succedit loco alteri∣us, non potest pro∣priè di unam con∣verti in aliam. Sua∣rez. Ies. loco citato. pag. 639. Translocation. {fleur-de-lys}And that justly, as Any may easily perceive, because in every true Transubstantiation there is a Change of a Sub∣stance into a Substance, as into that, which is the Terming of the Change: but in this your Adduction, there is said to be onely Terminus praesentiae, of the Praesence of Christ's Body, instead of the Presence of Bread. Therefore it is flatly Trans∣location onely. A word more; Transubstantiation (saith your Councel of Trent) is collected out of these words of Christ, [This is my Body:] But by sole Adduction (saith your AEgidius Co∣niax, Ies. de Sacram. Quaest. 75. Art. 4. Dubit. 4. num. 142. Ex quo pater, refutar, sententiam eam, quae docet corpus Christi adesse posse per so∣lam Adductionem, quia hoc non potest colligi conversio Pa∣nis in corpus, ex ver∣bis Christi. Iesuite Coninx) cannot be collected a Conversion of Bread into Christ's Body out of the words of Christ. Wee Conclude that seeing Conversion, whether by Produ∣ction, or by Adduction, are so plainly proved by your selves to be contrary to Truth: therefore it is not possible for you to believe a Doctrine so absolutely repugnant to your owne know∣ledge. {fleur-de-lys}This last figment being discarded, ponder (wee pray you) the Weight of this Argument. Every true and proper Transubstantiation is a Change into a substance that was not extant before. But the Body of Christ was, and is alwaies extant before the words of Consecration be used. Therefore is there no true and proper Change by Transub∣stantiation into the Body of Christ. Observe by the way that they, who gain-say the Productive, and teach the Adductive, yet do all deny Locall mutation à Ter∣mino ad Terminum. A Paradoxe which wee leave to your wise∣domes to contemplate upon. {fleur-de-lys}The next Contradiction is to be seene between your Ro∣mish Popes & their Councels, one against another: for your Pope Innocent 3. (whom your Doctors have so earnestly objected, as an high Patron of Transubstantiation) in the Councel of La∣terane, Anno 1560. definedInnocent. 3. Papa, lib. 3. de Offic. Missae, cap. 29. Sub∣stantia convertitur in id quod fit, & non erat, ut virga in colu∣brum; & tunc for∣ma convertitur cum substantia: quando∣que convertitur in id quod erat, & non sit, ut Panis in Eucharistia, & tunc substantia convertitur sine forma. Transubstantiation in the Eu∣charist to be in matter, and not in the substantiall forme. And your Pope Iulius the Second, in the Councel of Trent (as you haveSee above at the Letter (a) heard even now) defined Transubstantiation in the Eu∣charist to be both in Matter and Forme. This Contradiction is somewhat to the matter in hand (Wee thinke) to prove a spirit of Contradiction to be in your Romane Church.
CHALLENGE. II. {fleur-de-lys}In confutation of both the pretended Romish manners of Transubstantiation joyntly. VVHether you defend Transubstantiation by Producti∣on, or by Adduction, you are equally confutable in both, even by your owne Principles; who hold, that if the Bread, which is to bee Transubstantiated and changed into Christ's Body, bee annihilated, and brought to meere nothing, it cannot bee said to bee Transubstantiated at all. Now whe∣ther you thinke the Bread, after consecration, to be Annihila∣ted, we desire to know from your selves. Say then (but speak out, without lisping or stammering, we pray you, that we may heare and understand you.)Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. Cap. 24. Ne∣go Panem annihilari—nam etsi Panis nihil sit, tamen id in quod ipse conversus ēst, non est nihil, nec nullū, nec nusquam. Although Bread after Conse∣cration bee nothing (saith Bellarmine) yet it is not annihilated, that is, brought to nothing.Lessius Ies. Opusc. lib. 12. cap. 16. Circa substantiam Panis & Vini, primū miraculum est, quòd hae substantiae vi Cō secrationis funditus pereant, & veluti an∣nihilentur, quamvis non solemus dicere eas annthilari, eò quod haec desitio ex intentione divinâ, non sistat in nihilo, sed dirigatur ad po∣sitionem Corporis Christi: verum hoc ad modum loquendi spectat, nam quod ad rem attinet, nihil omninò substantiae panis manet, non for∣ma, non materia, non existentia, non gra∣dus aliquis, sed to∣tum ità funditùs pe∣rit, acsi prorsus in nihilum redactum esset, nullo positivo succedēte; nam quod aliud succedat, non est ex vi illius desitio nis—substantifico influxu subtracto, necesse est Rem in nihilum relabi. And the substance of Bread and Wine (saith your Iesuit Lessius) doe utterly perish, and are as it were Annihilated. So they; calling this a being Nothing, and yet not Annihilated; this not annihilated, and yet utterly pe∣rishing: naming also this maner to bee Miraculous, which we hold worthy rather to be esteemed Monstrous; the speech is altogether so contradictory in it selfe. Wherefore wee desire the foresaid Iesuite to play the Oe∣dipus in unfolding this Riddle: Our saying (saith hee) that Bread and Wine are not annihilated, belongeth to the formalitie of speech; for as concerning the thing it selfe, there is nothing of the Bread remaining either in forme or matter. So he. But that, say we, which is nothing, either in forme or matter, is sure∣ly annihilated: and therfore Bread becomming to be nothing, before Christ's Body be present, cannot possibly bee said to bee Changed into Christ's Body absent. And that the rather, because (as one of yourIoh. Pallanterius de Castro sacrae Theologiae Doctor, Lectiones Aureae. Nec materia, nec forma panis manent in se, vel in Corpore, Christi post conversionem, quià vere annihilantur. Doctors more ingenuously con∣fesseth) Bread not remaining, either in matter or forme, is truly Annihilated. To this Argument (in our Apprehension Insoluble) wee can receive from your great Dictator no better Answer than that,Bellar. quo suprà. Pani sucredit Corpus Christi, corrumpitur, & interit quicquid definit esse: at non annihilatur, nisi ità desinat esse, ut nihil ea succedit, ità ut ejus desitio terminetur in nihil. Because the substance of Bread ceaseth to bee, and the substance of Christ's Body succeedeth: Therefore the substance of Bread is said to be changed into Christ's Body. So he. Which his crotchet of Change, by Succeeding, hath been already ex∣ploded, as being but a Translocation, by his owneSee above at (g) Societie.
And yet againe, if it may bee, more plainly your Iesuit Vas∣quez; Vasquez in 3. Thom. qu 75. Art. 8. Disp. 181. Cap. 2. Panis in conveersione desinit esse, & cùm dicitur panem desinere in corpus Christi, non probat ipsam desitionem terminari formaliter ad positivum in quod fit conversio.—Quocirca modus ille loquendi non formaliter sed caus liter debet intelligi, quis enim dicat defitionem alicujus rei formaliter in aliquid termanari?—Ità ut ipsa Productio, seu Adductio non sit formaliter Conversio, sed causa illius.—Est igitur Conversio formaliter Denominatio quaedam ordinis per modum Actus, in eo quod definit, relata ad id, quod fuit causa desition. Aliquam . Haea duo, quae diximus, sunt necessaria & sufficiunt, ut Panis, Vinum, hoc ipso quod desinant, dicantur converti in corpus est sanguinem Christi. Neither Production, nor Adduction are formally this Conversion. Our Second Proofe of the Falshood of the Article of Transubstan∣tiation, is from the Article of our Christian Creed, [BORNE OF THE VIRGIN MARY.] SECT. II. TRansubstantiation (as hath beene defined by your Councell of Trent) is a Conversion of the substance of Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body. Now, in every such Substantiall Change, there are Two Termes, one is the Substance from which; the other is the Substance whereinto the Substantiall Change is made: as it was in Christ his miraculous Change of Water into Wine. But this was by producing the Substance of Wine out of the Substance of Water, as the matter, from which the Conversion was made. Therefore must it be by Production of the Substance of Christ's Body, out of the Substance of Bread. Your Cardinall hath no Evasion, but by denying the Conversion to be by Production, which notwithstanding was formerly the Generall Tenet of the Romish Schoole, ever since the Doctrine of Transubstantiation was hatched; and which is contrary to his owne device of Conversion by Adduction. wherein first he Dicta Corpus Christi ex pane fieri, non tanquàm ex ma∣teria, sed tanquàm à Termino à quo, ut mundus ex nihilo: [then confuting him∣selfe] etiam sit ex a∣qua vinum (that was not, ex nihilo.) In praesenti negotio, Conversio non est Productiva, Panis e∣nim convertitur in Corpus Christi prae∣existens: ergò Corpus Christi factum ex Pane, & ex Carne est idem. Bell. l. 3. de Euc. c. 24. § Ad Tertium confoundeth himselfe, and secondly, his opinion hath beene scornfully rejected by your owne learned Doctors, as being nothing lesse than Transubstantiation, as you have heard. There∣fore may you make much of your Breaden Christ. As for us, Wee, according to our Apostollicall Creec, believe no Body of Christ, but that which was Produced out of the Sanctified flesh of the Bl: Virgin Mary, for feare ofAlphonsus de Castro lib. 4 Tit. Christ{us}. Haer. 2. Ma∣nichaei dixerūt Chri∣stum non ex utero Virginis prodijsse; Et Apollinaris dixit Christum non as∣sumpsisse carnem ex Virgine. Item. Chili∣astae, Democritae, Melcluoritae, ut Pro∣cli mitae. pratcolus in Elench. Haeret. in suic quique titulis. Heresie. This same Objection being made of late to a Iesuite of prime note, received from him this Answer: viz. God that was able to raise Children to Abraham out of stones, can of Bread transub∣stantiate the same into that Body of Christ, which was of the Vir∣gin. And hee againe received this Reply; That the Children, which should bee so raised out of stones, howsoever they might bee Abraham's Children, according to Faith, yet could they not bee Children of Abraham according to the Flesh. There∣fore
is there as great a Difference betweene that Body: from Bread, and the other from the Blessed Virgin, as there must have beene betweene Children out of Stones, and Children out of Flesh. And this our Reason accordeth right well to the Ancient Faith professed within this Land, in the dayes of Edgar a Saxon King, as it is set out in anHomily en. Ea∣ster day, pag. 35. Homily of that time, which standeth thus. Much is betweene the body that Christ suffered in, and betweene the bodie of the hallowed Howsell. The Body truly, that Christ suffe∣red in, was borne of the flesh of the Virgin Mary, with blood, and with bone, with skin, and with sinewes, in humane limbes: and his Ghostly body, which we call his Howsell, is gathered of many Cornes, without blood, and bone, without lmbe, and therefore nothing is to be understood heerein bodily, but all is Ghostly to bee understood. This was our then Saxons Faith; wherein is plainly distingui∣shed the Body of Christ, borne of the blessed Virgin, from the Sa∣cramentall (which is called Ghostly) as is the Body of Flesh from the consecrated substance of Bread. A Doctrine directly con∣firmed bySee Booke 4. cap. 4. §. 1. in the Challenge. Saint Augustine. Wherefore wee may as truly say, concerning this your Conversion, that if it be by Transubstantia∣tion from Bread, then it is not the Body, which was borne of the Blessed Virgin; as your owne Romish Glosse could say of the Predication:See above, E. 2. Chap. 1. §. 4. If Bread bee Christ's Body, then Something was Christs Body, which was not borne of the Virgin Mary. CHALLENGE I {fleur-de-lys}In vindication of the same Truth, against the late Calumniation of a Iesuite. THis Sentence I have seene lately canvassed by a Iesuite, against a judicious and religious Knight,Sr. H. L. falsly imputing unto him divers Falsities; pretending especially that the English Translation, used by the Knight, is differing from the Latine. Which Exception of your Iesuite must needes have proceded either from ignorance, if hee knew not that the Translation, used by the Knight, was taken out of the Originall Saxon-language, and not out of the Latine; or, if he knew so much, from downe-right boldnesse, in charging him with a false Translation. I omit his frivolous Cavilla∣tions upon words. The maine question, for the sense, is whether in this sen∣tence, of the Saxons Faith, the Body, wherein Christ suf∣fered, and his Body celebrated in this Sacrament, betoken not two kinde of Bodies, essentially differing one from the other; or but onely the two different manners of the Being of one Body. Your Iesuite affirmeth them to signifie the same Bo∣dy,
and he calleth the contrary opinion false. His Reason. For whereas it is said, (saith he) that the spirituall flesh (which is as much as to say, our Saviour his flesh in the Sacrament) ac∣cording to the outward shew, consisting of Granes of Corne, hath no Bones, nor Sinewes, nor distinction of Parts, Life or Motion. Here the Iesuite cryeth out against falshood, but why? Be∣cause the Knight (forsooth) hath pretermitted (saith he) these words [According to the outward shew, consisting of granes.] Whereby he would have us believe the new mish Faith of a Subsistence of meere Accidents. Who if he had meant to have dealt ingenuously, he should have manifested that his Latine Translation to have accorded with the Originall Sa∣xon Copie. But to take him as wee finde him. If his words [According to the outward shew] imply (as it needs must, if he will speake to any purpose) that the Body of Christ, in this Sacrament, although in outward shew it be without Bones, Sinewes, Life and Motion, yet it hath all these inwardly in it selfe, as it is in this Sacrament; then whilest he laboureth to confute one Protestant, he contradicteth all his fellow Ie∣suites of the same Society,See Booke 4. Chap. . Sect. 2. who deny all possibility of Mo∣tion of Christ's Body in this Sacrament by any naturall and voluntary Act, without a miracle. But to speake to the point; This Body, and That Body (say wee) do diversifie two Bodies, the one Sacramentall (of Bread) called Spirituall (because of the spirituall and mysticall Signification) this Bread consisting of Granes: And the other the Naturall Body of Christ, consisting of Bones, Sinewes, &c. In a word, This, and That, in this Saxon narration, accordeth with the Doctrine ofSee Booke 4. Chap. 4. in the Chal∣lenge. Bertram, taken out of Saint Augustine, (namely) That in heaven to differ as much from This on the Altar, as did the Body borne of the Virgin Mary, from the o∣ther which was not so borne. But if this Homily will not advantage your Iesuite, hee will wrest his prejudicate Conceite out of another Homily of AElfrick, if it be possible, where we reade thus; As Christ before his Passion could convert the substance of Bread, and Crea∣ture of Wine into his owne Body that suffered, and into his Blood which afterwards was extant to be shed: So also was he able in the Desert to Convert Manna, and Water out of the Rock into his Blood. So he, citing a Testimonie as fully Opposite unto your Transubstantiation; in sense, as it seemeth to be absolutely for it in sound: it being just the same Doctrine, which Augustine, Anselme, and BedeSee hereafter Booke 5. Chap. 3. §. 1. & 2. taught, when they said, that the faithfull among the Iewes Ate the same spirituall meate, [Christs Flesh] in eating Manna, and dranke the same spirituall drink, that is, the blood of Christ, in drinking the water that issued out of the Rocke, which Christians now doe. And there∣fore
meant not a Corporall eating of Christ, but a Sacra∣mentall. So say wee, Christ could aswell then turne Manna, and Water of the Rocke, into a Sacrament of his Body and Blood, for the nourishing of the soules of God's people of those times; as he doth now Convert Bread and Wine into the Sacraments of his Body and Blood, for the comfort of us Christians. This Answer preventeth the Iesuites Objection:In his Booke of Spectacles, p. 142. The Time (saith he) when the people received Manna in the De∣sert, Christ was not in his humane nature; therefore could not Manna be changed into his Body, nor Water into his Blood. So he, very truly indeed. And therfore must AElfrick his speech be understood Sacramentally, as hath beene said: which be∣cause the Iesuite refuseth to do, therefore is he at difference with AElfrick, denying that Christ was able to convert Man∣na into his Body; which AElfrick said, in expresse termes, hee was able to do (namely) thorow his divine power, by a Sacra∣mentall Conversion; because Omnipotencie is as properly necessary for the making of a divine Sacrament, as it was for the creating of the World. But was it not then kindly done (thinke you) of your Iesuit to lend his Spectacles to another, when he had the most need of them himselfe? by the which he might have discerned, that as Christ Sacramentally (and therefore figuratively) cal∣led Bread his Body, and Wine his Blood; so did evermore all the faithfull of Christ. This LessonSee Booke 2. C. 2. Sect. 10. hath beene manifested by many pregnant Examples, in a full Section; which be∣ing once got by heart, would expedite all the like Difficul∣ties. To conclude, the former Saxon doctrine is againe confir∣med by SaintSee Booke 4. Chap. 4. §. 1. in the Challenge. Augustine. Wherefore wee may as truly say, concerning this your Conversion, that if it be by Transubstan∣tiation, from Bread, then it is not the Body, which was Borne of the Blessed Virgin, as your owne Romish Glosse could say of the Predication;See above B. 2. Chap. 1. §. 4. If Bread be Christ's Body, then some∣thing was Christ's Body, which was not borne of the Virgin Ma∣ry. And this wee are now furthermore to evince out of your Pope Innocent the Third, against your Councel of Trent. He (See the Margent of the former Section) taught that when the Conversion is of the forme with the substance, then is the Change Into that which is now made, and was not before, as when the Rod was turned into a Serpent. So he, shewing that the Serpent by that Change was therefore Made of that Rod. But your Tridentine Fathers (you know) have defined the Conversion of Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body to be aswell in Forme, as in Matter; whereupon by the Iudgement of your Pope Innocent it must follow, that the Body of Christ in your Eucharist is made of Bread; and if made of Bread,
then could it not possibly be of the flesh of the Virgin: Be∣cause there cannot be a Substantiall Change of a Substance into Substance, except that the Substance of that, whereinto the Conversion is wrought, have it's Originall and Making from the Substance of that, which was converted and chan∣ged. Nor could the Contrary be hitherto proved by any Romish Doctor, from any Example out of any conversion ei∣ther naturall, or miraculous, which hath beene road of from the beginning of Times. Our third Reason is taken from the Existence of Bread, in this Sacrament, after Consecration; but First of the State of this Question. SECT. III. VVEe wonder not why your Fathers of the Councell of Trent were so fierce in casting their great Thunderbolt ofSi quis dixe∣rit remane substn∣tiam Pans, Anathe∣ma sit. Conc. Trident. Sess. 13. Can. 2. Anathema, and Curse upon every man that should affirme; Bread and Wine to remaine in this Sacrament after Consecration: which they did, to terrifie men from the doctrine of Protestants, who do all affirme the Continuance of the substance of Bread in the Eucharist. For right well did these Tridentines know, that if the Substance of Bread or Wine doe remaine, then is all Faith, yea, and Conceit of Transubstantiation but a feigned Chimaera, and meere Fancie; as your Cardinall doth confesse, in granting, thatPanis esi non annihiltur, tamen manet nil in se; ut Aqua post Conver∣sionem in Vinum. Neq{que} obstat, quòd fouè materia man∣serit, nam materia  est Aqua. Prima ̄o∣ditio in vera Conver∣sione est,  quod convertitur  esse. Bessur. lio 3 de Euch. c 18  & cap. 24. §. Ad Alterum. It is a necessary condition in every Transubstantiation, that the thing which is converted cease any more to bee: as it was in the Conversion of Water into Wine; Water ceased to bee Water. And so must Bread cease to bee Bread. This being the State of the Question, wee undertake to give Good Proofes of the Existence, and Continuance of Bread in the Eucharist, the same in Substance, after Consecration. Our first Proofe is from Scripture, 1. Cor. 10. & 11. Saint Paul calling it [Bread.] SECT. IV. IN the Apostle his Comment (that I may so call his two 1. Cor. 11. 26, 27. & 10. 16. Chapters to the Corinthians) upon the Institution of Christ, we reade of Eating the Bread, and Drinking the Cup, thrice: all which, by the consent of all sides, are spoken of Eating and Drinking after Consecration; and yet hath hee called the our∣ward
Element Bread. You will say (with Some) It was so called onely because it was made of Bread; as Aärons Rod, tur∣ned into a Serpent, was notwithstanding called a Rod. But this Answer is not Answerable unto the Similitude. For first, of the Bread, the Apostle saith demonstratively, This bread; and of the other, This Cup: But of Aärons Rod, turned into a Serpent, none could say, This Rod. And secondly, it is contrary to Christian Faith, which will abhorre to say, in a proper sense, that Christs Body was ever Bread. Or else you will answer, with Others, It is yet called Bread, because it hath the Similitude of Bread, as the Brazen Serpent was called a Serpent. But neither this, nor any other of your Imaginations can sa∣tisfie; for we shall proove, that the Apostle would never have called it Bread after Consecration, but because it was Substanti∣ally, still, Bread. Our Reason is; He had now to deale against the Prophaners of this Sacrament, in reproving such as used it as Common Bread,1. Cor. 11. 22. Not discerning therein (Sacramentally ex∣hibited) the Lords Body. It had therefore concerned him to have honored the Sacrament with Divine Titles, agreeable to the Bo∣dy of Christ, hypostatically united to his Godhead, and to have denied it absolutely to have beene Bread, considering that by the name of Bread the glory of the same Body might seeme to be abased, and Eclipsed; if in Truth, and Verity he had not be∣leeved it to have beene (then) properly Bread. This Reason, we guesse, you are bound to approve off, who, in your opinion of the Corporall Presence of Christ his Body, and Absence of Bread, would never suffer any of your Professors to call it, after Consecration, by the name of Bread. Whereupon it was that the GreekeArchipisc. Ca∣basila. Latini nostros reprehendunt, quòd post illa verba [Hoc est Corpus meum] Panem & Vinum nominant, &c. Ex∣posit. Liturg. cap. 29. Archbishop of Cabasila complained of the Romish Professors, for reprehending the Greeke Liturgies: why? Because (saith he) after the words of Christ, [This is my Bo∣dy] wee call the Symbols and Signes Bread, and Wine. So he. Which bewrayeth, that the very naming of the Sacrament Bread, and Wine, is, in the judgement of the Church of Rome, prejudiciall to their Transubstantiation; and that if Saint Paul himselfe should deliver the same words he did, at this day, hee should by your Romish Inquisitors be taught to use his Termes in another stile. What need many words? except in the words of Christ the word [Body] be properly predicated, and affir∣med of Bread, farewell Transubstantiation of Bread into Christs Body. But that it is impossible the Body of Christ should bee properly predicated upon Bread, hath beene the Generall Con∣fession of your owne Doctors, and the Conclusion of our se∣cond Booke. {fleur-de-lys}Wee returne againe to the Text, where the Apostle having named it Bread, after Consecration, expoundeth himselfe what Bread he meant, saying, Bread which we breake.
But never durst any of your Romanists say, that the Body of Christ is truly Broken in this Sacrament: and never any Father of Primitive times (we are sure) taught the Breaking of the Accidents of Bread. And therefore it must follow, that it was still substantially Bread. The Apostle hath not yet done, but 1 Cor. 17. sayth, Be∣cause it is one Bread, wee being many are one Body for wee all communicate of one Bread. Which Chrysostome, is well as other Fathers, doth analogize thus:See above B. 2. ap. 2. Sect. 6. Chal∣leng 1. See also Cy∣pri, and S. August. Bk. 3. Chapt. 3. Sect. 9. That as o loafe consisteth of many granes united together, so are the faithfull Communicants joyned together. So hee, hereby teaching you the substantiall Materialls of the same Bread, Many granes of Corne. And, as though the Apostle had meant to muzzle the Adversaries of this truth with variety of proofes, hee (1 Cor 10. 17.) hath these words, Wee participate ] that is, De pane hoc, Of this Bread; thus called after Consecration. And againe, 1 Cor. 11. 28. Let him eate [ Of this Bread, which manifesteth the Eating of a part of an whole loafe of Bread; and not of the Body of Christ, which, even by the Romish faith, is not, nor cannot bee divided into parts. Thus hath Saint Paul, the Scholler of Christ, concluded of Substantiall Bread, agreeable to that which our Master Christ himselfe taught of the other sacred Substantiall part of Drinke, after the Cosecration of this Sacrament, as is pro∣ved in the next Section. Our Second Proofe of the Continuance of the Substance of Bread, is from the speech of Christ, touching the Continuance of Wine, after Consecration, Matth. . 29. by the Interpretation of Antiquity. SECT. V. THe same is as fully verified by our Lord and Master Christ himselfe, in the second Element of Wine, calling itMatth. 26. 29. This fruit of the Vine, that is, Wine, after Consecration: where the Pronoune This hath relation to the matter in the Cup of the Eucharist. For the proofe of this our Exposition of the words of Christ, wee have the Consent of these and thus many holy Fa∣thers; Origen, Cyprian, Chrysostome, Augustine, Hierome, E∣piphanius, Euthymius, Theophylact, and Bede, as witnesseth your IesuiteOrigenes, Cy∣prianus, Chrysost. August. Hieron. Epi∣phan. Beda, Euthy∣mius, Theophylact. [Genimen Vis] ad Sanguinem Christi referunt.—Maldon. Is Com. in cum locum; where he addeth: Persuadere mhnon possum haec verba ad Sanguinem esse referenda.—Hoc Patres, sed also sensu à Calvinistis, qui dicunt Christum Vinum appellâsse, quia Vinum erat: sed Patres vocâ unt Sanguinem Vanum, sicut Christus Car∣nem, Iohan. 6. vocabat Panem. Maldon. in eundem locum. Haec, nè illi Calvinistatum errori affinis esse vide∣atur. Maldon. ibid. Maldonate (no one Father produced by him to the
contrary,) Then answering; But I (saith hee) cannot be thus per∣swaded. So hee. Marke this (you great Boasters of Accordance with Antiquity!) and yet this maner of Answering the Fathers is most familiar with this Iesuite. But hee proceedeth, telling you that The Fathers notwithstanding did not call it Wine, as thin∣king it to bee Wine, but even as Christ did, when he called his flesh Bread, Iohn 6. Then hee addeth; They that will follow the Ex∣position of These Fathers, are thus to interpret them. And gives his Reason of this his Advertisement; Lest the other Exposition (saith hee) may seeme to agree with the erroneous opinion of the Calvinists. So hee. For which his Answer Calvinists are as much beholding to him, as are the Ancient Fathers, with whom he hath made bold not only to reject their Authority, but also to pervert the plaine and evident meaning of their Testimonies; who declare that they understood Naturall and Substantiall Wine (as theNovum pro∣misit, id est, Novum quendam modum sumptionis in regno, id est, post resurrecti∣onem, quando Ci∣bum sumpsit corpo∣ralem.

Mar∣ginals doe manifest) so plainly, as to affirme that It was Wine, which then Christ dranke: and that hereby the Practices of the Heretikes Aquarij are confuted, who would drinke nothing but Water in the Eucharist. That which commeth out of the fruit of the Vine; which certainly produceth wine, and not water. So Chrysost. It was the Wine (saithAugust. de dogmat. Eccles. cap. 75. Vinum fuit in redemptionis nostrae mysterijs, cùm dixit [Non bibam.] Augustine) which was used in the myste∣ries of our Redemption. Even that Wine, which was blessed (saithClemens Alex. Quòd Vinum esset, quod bene∣dictum fuit, ostendit rursus dicens, [Non bibam de fructu Vitis.] Lib. Paedag. 2. cap. 2. sub finem. Clemens Alexandrinus.) And your owne Bishop Cùm Matthaeus, & Marcus nullius alterius Calicis secerint mentionem praeter sacri, quod dicitur [De genimine Vi∣tis] nullus alius Calix intelligi potest ab ijs demonstratus, quàm cujus mem inerant—Et omninò vide∣tur ex Matthaeo & Marco dictum hoc post consecrationem. Iansen. Episc. Concord. in eum locum, pag. 914. Col. 2. Iansenius doth confesse, that these words of Christ had re∣ference to the Cup in the Eucharist; and not (as Some say) to the Cup of the Passeover. {fleur-de-lys} Yea to the Eucharist, as your Pope Innocentius didInnocent. 3. de officio Missae, lib. 4. cap. 2. Quod autem Vinum in Calice consecravit, patet ex eo, quod ipse subjunxit; [Non bibam ex eo, donec, &c.] teach you: (I say Innocentius the Pope) That Christ consecrated Wine in the Cup, is evident (saith he) by that which Christ added, saying, [I will not henceforth drinke of it untill, &c.] Marke you furthermore the Errour of the Aquarij, and the Confutation thereof. They used onely Water in the Eucharist, in pretece ofSee above, Book. 1. Chap. 3. §. 10. Sobriety; which Cypriaen confuted onely upon this ground, viz. that this practice was not warranted by the See above, Book. 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 3. And here above in the Margin. Institution of Christ, wherein Christ ordained Wine, and not Onely Water. And now tell us, if that your Doctrine of
Transubstantiation had beene an Article of Faith, in those daies, whether it had not concerned Cyprian to have stood exactly up∣on it, for the more just condemnation of those Aquarij, to let them know, that if they would needs use only Water, then (ac∣cording to your Doctrine) their Consecration should be void; and consequently their Adoration (if it had beene then in use) should have beene likewise Idolatrous. But wee heare no more of these your Exceptions. The former Proofe confirmed by Analogie betweene Bread and Christ's Body; both Naturall, and Mysticall. SECT. VI. IN 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17. [The Bread which wee breake (saith the Apostle) is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? for we being many are one Bread and one Body, in as much as wee all par∣take of one Bread.] In this Sentence the word [Bread] hath a double Relation, the First to Christ his Body Naturall. Thus the joynt Participation of the Bread is called the Communion of the Body of Christ. The Analogie, in this respect, is excellently expressed byPanis, quià con∣firmat Corpus, ideò Corpus Christi no∣minatur: Vinum au∣tem, quià sanguinem operatur, ideò ad sanguinem refertur. Haec autem duo sunt visibilia, sanctificata autem per Spiritum sanctum, in Sacra∣mentum divini Cor∣poris transeunt. Isi∣dor. Hisp. de Offic. Lib. 1. cap. 18. See above, Booke 2. Chap. 1. §. 9. at (x) Isidore: Bread (saith he) because it strengthe∣neth the Body, is therefore called Christ's Body; and Wine, be∣cause it turneth into Blood, is therefore called Christ's Blood. These are two Visibles, but being sanctified by the holy spirit, are turned into a Sacrament of Christ's Body. So he. This is indeed a true Analogie, not to be performed by Accidents. Could any of them, whom you call Calvinists, have spoken more significantly either in contradicting your Exposition of Christ's words? (for he saith that Christ called Bread his Body;) or in declaring the true proper Sense of the Sacramentall Con∣version? (for he saith, Bread is Changed into a Sacrament of Christ's Body;) or else in giving the Reason why Bread and Wine were chosen to be Sacraments and Signes of Christ's Body, and Blood, by which wee are spiritually fed? (for he sheweth that it is because of their Naturall Effects, Bread substantially, and therefore not Accidentally, strengthneth Man's Body: Wine turneth into Blood.) Which overthroweth your third Figment of onelySubstantia Pa∣nis non pertinet ullo modo ad rationem Sacramenti, sed so∣lùm Accidentia. Bel∣lar. Lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 23 §. Respondeo substantiam. Accidents; as if the Substance of Bread and Wine were not necessary in this Sacrament. Say then, doth the Acci∣dent of Roundnesse, and Figure of Bread strengthen man's Body? or doth the Accident, Colour of Wine, turne into Blood? As well might you affirme the only Accident of Water in Baptisme to be sufficient to purge and clense the Body, by the colour, and cold∣nesse, without the substantiall matter thereof. The Second part of the Analogie is discerned in the Mysti∣call Body of Christ, which is the Congregation of the Faithfull
Communicants; [1. Cor. 10. 17. Wee are all one Body, in as much as wee are partakers of one Bread.] It standeth thus; As many Granes of Corne make one Loafe of Bread, and many Grapes make one measure of Wine in the Cp: So, many Christians, partaking faithfully of this Sacrament, become One mysticall Body of Christ by the Vnion of Faith, and Love.

He was held a most expert and artificiall Panter, in Plinie, that could paint Grapes so to life, as to deceive Birds; which came to feed on them: But they are the onely Sophisticall Doctours, that offer in the Eucharist onely Accidents, as painted Colours in stead of naturall; because where there is not a Sacramentall Analogie, there is no Sacrament. You may not say, that the Analogie consisteth in the matter before Consecration; because every Sacramentall Analogie is betweene the Sacrament, and the Thing Signified: but it is no Sacrament, before it be Conse∣crated. CHALLENGE. SAy now, what Better Authour is there than Christ? What better Disciple and Scholler, than the Apostle of Christ? or what better Commentary upon the words of Christ, and his Apostle, than the Sentences of Ancient Fathers? calling the one part Wine, the other Bread, after Consecration, as you have heard. Our Third Proofe, that the Substance of Bread remaineth after Consecration in the Sacrament, is taken from the Iudge∣ment of Sense, necessarily. First, by the Authority of Scripture. SECT. VII. ALthough man's Sense may be deceived, through the incon∣venient Disposition of the Medium, thorow which hee seeth, as it hapneth in judging a strait Staffe to bee Crooked, which standeth in the Water; and in thinking a White Object to bee Greene in it selfe, which is seene thorow a Greene glasse;
or Secondly by the unequall Distance of place, as by concel∣ving the Sunne to bee but two feete in breadth; or Thirdly by some defect in the Organ, or Instrument of seeing (which is the Eye) whereby it cometh to passe that wee take One to bee Two, or mistake a Shadow for a Substance. Yet notwith∣standing when our Eyes, that see, are of good Constitution, and Temper; the Medium, whereby wee see, is perfectly disposed; the Distance of the Object, which wee see, is indifferent; then (say we) the judgement of Sense, being free, is True, and the Concurrence and joynt consent of divers Senses, in one arbitre∣ment, is infallible. This Reason, taken from Sense, you peradventure will judge to bee but Naturall and Carnall, as those Termes are opposed to a true and Christian maner of Reasoning. We defend the Contrary, being warranted by the Argument which Christ himselfe used to his Disciples, Luke 24. 39. [Handle mee, and see.] Your Cardinall, although hee grant that this Reason of Christ was available, to prove that his owne Body was no Spirit, or Fancy, but a true Body, even by the onely Argument from the sense of Touching;Consequen∣tia Christi, affirma∣tivè sumpta, Hoc palpatur, hoc videtur, Ergo est Corpus, op∣tua fuit, quià sensus non fallitur circa pro∣prium Objectum: ta{que} necessariò quod videtur, & tangitur Corporale est. At negativè, hoc non palpatur; nec videtur, Ergò non est corpus, Dominus non fecit, & mala est. Non fal∣luntur Sensus nostri, cum nos album quid, rotundum, solidum sentire arbitramur, quae sunt propria ob∣jècta. Sed cùm Panis Substantiam sub illis Accidentibus atere denunciant, fallun∣tur. Dominus solùm probare voluit se non esse inane spectrum, seu Phantasma, sed verum Corpus; id quod ex Testimonio sensus Tangendi op∣timè probavit. Illud autem Corpus esse humanum, idem quod anteà suerat, non probavit Dominus hoc solo Argumento, ex Tan∣gendi sensu desumpto (quod sine dubio non erat sufficiens) sed multis alijs modis, loquendo, manducando, testimonio Angelorum, miraculo Piscium, allegatione Scripturarum. Bellar. l. 1. de Euch. c. 14. §. Respondeo. Yet (saith hee) was it not suffi∣cient in it selfe, without other Arguments, to confirme it and to prove it to have bin a human body, and the very same which it was. So he. Which Answer of your Cardinall wee wish were but onely false, and not also greatly irreligious: for Christ demonstrated hereby not onely that hee had a Body (as your Cardinall spea∣keth) but also that it was his owne same Humane Body, now ri∣sen, which before had beene Crucified, and wounded to Death, and buried, according to that of Luke [That it is even I] Luke 24, 39. Now because1. Cor. 15. It is not a Resurrection of a Body, except it bee the Same Body: Therefore would Christ have Thomas to Ioh. 20. 27. thrust his hands into his sides, and feele the print of his wounds, to manifest the Same Body; as Two of your Iesuites do also observe, the One with an [Optimè Origenes, Ostendit se Christus in vero Corpore suo re∣suscitatum. Tolet. les. in Ioh. c. 20. pag. 534. Optimè,] the Other with a [Probatum est, Christum idem Corpus numero demon∣strāsse. Silarez Ies. Tom. 2. qu. 54. §. 1. Pro∣batum est.] Accordingly the Apostle Saint Paul laid this Argu∣ment, taken from Sense, as the Foundation of a Fundamentall Article of Faith, even the Resurrection of the Same Body of Christ from the dead; for how often doth hee repeate, and inculcate this?1. Cor. 15. 5. Hee was seene, &c. And againe thrice more, Hee was seene, &c. And Saint Iohn argueth, to the same purpose, from the Concurrence of three Senses:1. Ioh. 1. 1. That which wee have heard, which wee have seene, and our hands have handled, declare wee unto you. The validity of this Reason was proved by the Effect, as
Christ averreth;1. Ioh. 20. 29. Thomas because thou hast seene (that is, percei∣ved both by Eye, and hand) thou hast beleeved. The Validity of the Iudgement of Sense, in THOMAS, and the other Disciples, confirmed (in the second place) by your owne Doctors. SECT. VIII. PErerius a Iesuit confidently pleadeth for the Sense of Touch; Illud sine du∣bitatione dicere non verebor, non polle ab ullo Dmone for∣mari corpus corpus adeò si∣mile humano, ut si∣quis cum curà animi & attentione id tan∣geret, non facilè dig∣nosceret ipsum non esse corpus huma∣num. Itaque non po∣terit Daemon simili∣tudine corporis hu∣mani oculos fallere. Tactus autem sen∣sum fallere omninò non potest, quod quatuor Argumentis confirmabo—Hoc verissimum esse patet ex eo, quod Chri∣s∣tus dixit discipulis suis [Palpate & vide∣te:] & Thomae [Af∣ter digitum, &c.] Pe∣rer. Ies. in Gen. 6. num. 78. pag. 2. I feare not (saith hee) to say, that the Evidence of Sense is so strong an Argument, to prove without all doubt an humane Bo∣dy, that the Devill himselfe cannot herein delude the touch of man, that is of understanding and consideration. As for the unbelee∣ving Disciples, [Christ his Handle me, &c.] saith your Iesuite Si Discipuli Christi non potuis∣sent Christi vera osta & carnes discernere, mollitiem, & duriti∣em eorum, non dix∣isset ijs [Palpate, & videte:] ac si di∣ceret, Palpate & Percipite veras car∣nes & ossa. Vasquez Ies. Tom. 2. qu. 51. Art. 2. disp. 184. cap. 2. pag. 487. Thomas dicit singula Argumenta non fuisse per se sufficientia, benè tamen conjuncta probari cum testimonijs Prophe∣tarum—Ego tamen cùm Cajetano Argumentum illud Tactus efficacissimum fuisse ad comprobandum vetitatem Corporis humani in Christo. Idem. ibid. Vasquez, was as much as if he had sayd to them, Perceive you my true flesh? as being a most efficacious Argument to proove the truth of an humane Body. So hee, yea, andIllud Thomae [non credam, &c] pertinaciae & obdurationis vitium erat, & peccatum Infidelitatis. Optimè Orig. lib. 2. con. Celsum, ubi docet Discipulos affirmâsse illum, quem viderunt, esse Christum in Corpore vero suo, & resuscitato: nam Thomas sciebat ani∣mas interdùm apparere Corporibus, & proprias formare voces, & tamen non esse Corpora vera. Quapropter non dixit solùm [Nisi videro, non credam] sed adjunxit, [Nisi infero manum in vestigia Clavorum.] Tolet. Ies. Com. in Ioh. 20. Tolet another Iesuite did well discerne the case of Thomas to have beene an extreme Infidelity, when hee said, [Except I put my finger in∣to the print of the nayles, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not beleeve.] Which prooveth the Efficaciousnesse of the Iudgement of Sense, in reducing so extreme an Vnbeleever to beleeve. Wherein your Authors are authorized by S. Augustine,Aug. de tempore. Si fortè, inquit, Diceremus Thomae oculos fuisse deceptos, at non possemus dicere maus frustratas: de Tactu non potest dubitari. Et Greg. Pont. Plus nobis Thomae infidelitas ad fidem, quàm fides credentium Discipulorum prosuit: quià dubius ille Carnem palpando ad fidem reducitur, mens nostra omni dubltatione postpositâ. Teste Maldon. Ies. Com. in Ioh. 20. say∣ing that Although Thomas his Eyes had beene deceived, yet his touch was not frustrate. And accordingly by Gregory Pope of Rome, who sticketh not to say, that The Infidelity of Thomas made more for confirmation of Christian Beliefe, than did the faith of the other Apostles: Because his Doubtfulnesse being convinced by the Sense of Touching, wee are thereby freed from all doubtfulnesse in the faith. And if this were not sufficient to confute your Car∣dinall, he may be shackled with his owne Answer, who, to dis∣able the Infallibilitie of the Sense of feeling, said;See above at (b) That other Arguments were requisite for the certifying the judgement of Sense: and among these Other hee reckoneth Christ his speaking, eating, and working Miracles. All which, what are they else (wee pray you) but equally Objects of Sense? What Vertigo
then may this be called in him, to seeke to invalidate the ve∣rity of Sense, by an Argument which justifieth the Certaintie of Sense? A third Confirmation of the Truth of Senses, as sufficient in Di∣vine Causes, for discerning Objects of Sense: and particularly in perceiving Bread and Wine to continue the same in this Sacrament; by the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. IX. HOw many Heretikes of old were there (such as the Va∣lentinians, Montanists, Marcionites) who denyed that Christ had a True, and Essentiall Body? and how absolutely were they confuted of Ancient Fathers, by the Evidence of mens Senses that heard, saw, and felt the Body of Christ? Which sheweth plainly, that a Demonstration by Sense standeth good and strong, even in Christian Philosophie. And to come to the point in Question, (to conclude againe from the Premises in the former Section,) who can deny this Consequence, viz. By the same Evidence may a Christian man prove Bread to be truly Bread, after Consecration, whereby Christ proved his Body to be a Body of flesh, after his Resurrection? But this he did from the Infallibility of Sense. Therefore this may be equally con∣cluded by the same Argument of Sense. And that there is the same Reason of both these, the Ancient Father Theodoret sheweth in the Argument, wherewith he con∣futed an Heretike by Sense, thus;Eranistes apud Theod. Quia sicut Pa∣nis desinit esse Pa∣nis post Consecrati∣onem, sed mutatur in substantiam Cor∣poris Christi. Ita Corpus Christi post resurrectionem desi∣nit esse propriè Cor∣pus, sed in Naturam divinam mutatur Or∣thodox. Imò verò, ut te capiam in laqueis his: Signa mystica non recedunt à natu∣rà suâ, manent enim in priori suâ formâ, figurâ, & substantià. Theod, Dial 2. c. 24. As after Consecration (saith he) Bread remaineth the same in substance: So Christ his Body after the Resurrection remained in substance the same. Thus much of the Analogie. (As for the word [Substance] more is to be spoken thereofSee hereafter, Sect. 12. hereafter.) Yea, and Saint Augustine will not suffer the Communicant to blind-fold himselfe, whose Testimony (digested byBeda ex Augu∣stino, Serm. ad Insd∣tes in cap. 10. ad Cor. fol. 139. apud Bedam. Quod vidistis Panis est, quod oculi vestri renunciant, quod autem fides vostra, &c. Sic ex multis granis tritici unus Panis: Ita ex multitudine fidelium, una assurgit Ecclesia. Rede) is this: That which you have seene is Bread, as your eyes do manifest unto you. And he spea∣keth of Bread, as this Sacrament was a Symbol, and Signe of the mysticall Body of Christ, which is his Church, consisting of a multi∣tude of Faithfull Communicants, as one Loafe doth of many granes of wheat. {fleur-de-lys}Give Chrysostome leave to put in his suffrage, especially in that Sentence,Chrysost. de Resurrect. (Objected by D. Heskins in his Parliam. Book. 2. Chap. 11.) Non est meum, meos ludificare Phantasmate, vanam imaginem visus si timet, veritatem corporis manus ac digitus exploret: Possie fortassis aliqua oculos caligo decipere: Palpatio Corporalis verum Corpus agnoscat, Spiritus non habet ca∣nem & ossa, ut me sentitis habere. Quòd ostia clausa penetravi, sola est virtus divina, non sola carnis substantia. which is objected against us by your
owne Doctor, wherein that holy Father bringeth in Christ, as speaking to his Disciples, concerning the verity of the Sense of Feeling, and delivereth two points, especially re∣markable. One is, that Although the Sight, by reason of some defect, might be easily deceived: yet the Tryall by Touch, in discerning a Body of flesh, is beyond all peradven∣ture. The Second is, that if Christ should have propounded any Object, as being a Body, wherein their Touch should be deceived, he might then be said to have mocked and deluded his Disciples. Whereunto accordeth the like Testimony of Pope Gregory, above cited, in the former Section. And is not the Touch, in discerning the bodily Creature of Bread, and Flesh, of equall efficacie? yea, and againe Augustine in another place, objected by your owne selves;August. in Ioh. Tract 26. Objected by Dr. Heskins, Parl. Book. 2. Chap. 219. Our Lord Iesus (saith he) commended his Body and Blood in those things, which of many are brought into one certaine thing: for the one is made into one of many Granes, and so Consisteth; the other Cometh into one, of many Grapes. Consonantly S. Cyprian, and as plainly,Cyprian. lib. 1. Epist. 6. ad Mag. Nam quando Domi∣nus Corpus suum pa∣nem vocat, de mul∣torum granorum ad∣unatione congestum; Populum nostrum quem portabat, indi∣cat adunatum: & quando Sanquinem suum vnum appellat, de botris &  expressum, gregem item nostrum signifi∣cat commixtione a∣dunatae multitudinis copulatum. (luxta Edit. Pamel. Epi. 76) When Christ called his Body Bread, (saith he) which Bread was made one, by the Gathering together of many Cornes; he thereby signifieth our people, whom he bore, shewing them united together: and when he called Wine his Blood, which Wine is pressed out of many Clu∣sters of Grapes, and so gathered into one; he signifieth one stocke coupled together, by Conjunction of a Multitude into One. Both these holy Fathers (even as Chrysostome already, Both. 3. chap. 3. Sect. 4. hath done) teach, as it were with one breath, that the Outward Sacramentalls, wherein Christ commen∣deth his Body and Blood, being Substances compounded, the one of divers Cornes in one loafe, the other of divers Grapes in one liquor, doe so continue the same still at the re∣ceiving thereof, (as the Analogie irrefutably proveth,) be∣cause these Both signifie the mysticall Body of Christ, which is the Church of his faithfull, by the union of multitudes of peo∣ple in one. But in your meere Accidents of Bread and Wine, you can have no union either of Granes, or of Grapes; nei∣ther can you say, that he spake not of the things Consecrated, because the things were first Consecrated, before they were commended to his Disciples to be eaten and dranke. Athanasius will be content to deliver his vote after the o∣ther other now cited Primitive Fathers; who, in confutation of the Hereticall Manichees, who fancied onely a Phantasticall Body of Christ, observeth that (Athan. Tom. 2. Orat 2. in As∣sumpt. Christ.— Christ both did eate meate, and permitted his Body to be touched of his Disciples, that
thereby they might have not onely their eyes, but also their hands Witnesses of the Truth of his Body, and remove all exception of the apparition of a Ghost, yea, and that By the continued sight hereof with their bodily eyes, Christ insinuated Faith into their soules. Gladly would wee know whether even any doctrine could more patronize that Hereticall doctrine of a Rhantasti∣call Body, than this yours, of your maner of the Presence of Christ's Body in the Echarist doth where in these appeareth not so much as a Spectrum of that Body, but onely (as you each) Accidents of Bread. {fleur-de-lys} Tertullian hath a large Plea against the Academicks, who de∣nied the judgement of Sense; wherein hee maintaineth the Truth of the Senses, and in proofe thereof hee manifesteth the Perfe∣ction of Christ his Senses in Seeing, Feeling, Tasting, Smelling; and at length he falleth upon the point now in Question, saying, thatTertull de A∣nimà, cap 7 ad finem. Quid agi. Academi∣ce procacissime? to∣tum vitae fltum e∣vertis, ipsius Dei providentiam excae∣cas—non licet in dubium sensus istos revocare, nè & in Christo de fide eo∣rum deliberetur: nè fortè dicatur, quòd falsò Patris vocem audicrit de ipso testi∣ficatam, aut deceptus sit, cum Petri socrum tetigit: aut alium po∣stea unguenti sense∣rit spiritum, quod in sepulturam suam ac∣ceptavit: aum po∣steà Vin aporem, quod in Sanguinis sui memoriam con∣secrt. Sic enim & Mrcion Phantasma cum maluit credere, totius corporis in eo dedignaus veritatem: Atqui nè in Apostolis quidem ludificata natura est, fidelis fuit & visus, & auditus in Monte, fidelis & gustus Vin in nupjs, fidelis tactus Thomae. Recita testationem Iohannis; Quod audivimus, inquit, quod oculis vidimus; & maus nostrae contrectârunt de sermone vitae. Falsa utique testatio, si oculorum & aurium, & ma∣nuum sensus natura mentitur. If wee yield not to the suffrages of Senses, some may doubt whether Christ perceived afterwards another Sent of oyntment, which hee received (meaning another that the naturall Sunt thereof) before his Buriall. And immedialy hee addeth, (marke we pray you) One might doubt also whether Christ tasted afterwards another taste of Wine, than was that, which he consecra∣ted for the memoriall of his Blood. That then, which Christ Ta∣sted, was first Consecrated. Next, he invadeth the Heretike Marcion, for denying the Truth of Christ's Body on earth, and con∣futeth him by the fidelity of the Senses of the Apostles. Faith∣full (saith he) was their sight of Christ in the Mount, Faithfull was their Taste of Wine at the Marriagè, Faithfull was the Touch of Thomas, &c. (then concluding:) VVhich Testifications (saith he) had not beene True, if their Senses had beene Liars. So he in his confutation not onely of the naturall Academicks, but also of the Hereticall Marcionites, who (contrary to the demon∣stration of the Apostles Senses) denied the truth of the humane Body of Christ. CHALLENGE. THis Apologie of Tertullian, in behalfe of the verity of the Senses, doth minister to all Christians foure Conclusions, First, not to conceit of Accidents without Subjects: but to dis∣cerne of Subjects, and Substances, by their Accidents. Second∣ly, that our Outward Senses rightly constituted (more especially the Sense of Feeling) are Demonstrations of Truth, in Sensi∣ble Objects. Thirdly, that this verification of Subjects, by their
Accidents, is common with Christ, his Apostles, all Christians, and with every reasonably man. And lastly, that VVine is to be discerned to be truly and naturally VVine, after Consecration, by the judgement of the Senses, because he instanceth in this very point: teaching that Christ had the same taste of Substan∣tiall VVine afterwards, which hee had before in that which hee consecrated; even as he had also the same Sent of Substantiall Oyntment after, which hee had before his Buriall. And all this even now, when he convinced Marcion of Heresie, an Ene∣mie to the Catholike Faith, in denying the Truth of Christs humane naturall Body, notwithstanding the Evidence of Man's Senses. Here had beene a full and flat Evasion for that Heretike to say, what tell you us of the validitie of the Evidence of two Senses, concerning the Truth of Christ's Body, seeing you your∣selves gain-say the judgement of foure Senses at once, in de∣nying the Existence of Bread in this Sacrament? This, we say, they must needs have replyed, if that the Catholikes then had beene of your now Romane Beliefe, to thinke that all the Sen∣ses are deceived, in judging the matter of this Sacrament to continue Bread or wine; and so might they have blowne away all this Catholike Confutation of Heretikes and Infidels with one and the same breath, together with the like Instances a∣gainst the same Heresie, already specified, as you have heard. Come now hither all yee that say wee must renounce all Verdict of Senses in this Case; and tell us whether any Prote∣stant could have beene more opposite to your Doctrine than was Tertullian, in his Defence of this Truth? whereby hee also defendeth the Catholike Doctrine of the Resurrection of Christ, and was never hereof questioned by any Catholike, in, or since his dayes. Let none of you object that of the Disciples, in their way to Emmaus with Christ, of whom it is sayd, that [Luc. 24. 16. They could not know him:] for the same Text giveth this Cause, that their eyes were holden, lest they should see him: and after,Ibid. vers. 31. Their eyes were opened, and they saw him. So the Evangelist, which is so farre from infringing any thing that hath beene sayd, for the Infallibilitie of Sense, rightly constituted and disposed, that this thereby is notably confirmed. Wee call upon Hierome to witnesse, saying;Hieron. ad Pammach: contra Errores Iohan. Ieru∣sal. Episc. Scias er∣rorem fuisse non cor∣poris Domini, sed oculorum fuisse clau∣sorum: nam aperti sunt oculi eorum, & videbant. The Error of not discerning Christ, when hee was in the midst betweene them, was not in Christ's Body, but in their eyes, because they were closed that they could not see. Apply wee this unto the Eucharist. Dare any Papist say, that the Cause, why any of you cannot see Christ in this Sacrament, is not in his Body (which you beleeve to bee in it selfe invisible) but in your Eyes, as being shut up; when notwithstanding you
will bee knowne, that these are open enough for discerning Co∣lours, and formes of Bread and Wine. {fleur-de-lys}It can bee but a matter of merriment, to acquaint you with that which Master Malloune a Iesuite reporteth in good sadnes, as thus:Mr. Malloun in his Reply, pag. 305. A devout Mayde of the Vulgar sort, by name Ioane Martlesse, (a thing most admirable, saith hee) was able to finde out one only consecrated Host, among a thousand un∣consecrated, not onely by Divine revelation, but also by her na∣turall Senses. So your Iesuite (as hee saith) out of Waldensis. Although wee will not trifle the time, by asking how shee could smell out that one Host among a thousand, or whether the Priest infused some smellable virtue into it, to give it a Sent, yet must wee tell you, that when afterwards (in the se∣venth Booke) it shall bee discovered unto you, that there are incident to the Action of your Priest, in Conscrating, a∣bove five hundred possible Defects, which may nullifie his whole Act, so that the thing remaine still Bread (notwith∣standing whatsoever his maner of Consecrating, by him performed;) You will then know how happy it were for your Church, that every Priest at Masse had the use of the Nose of Ioane Martlesse, to trie whether there bee any Hosb truly consecrated, as being (according to your Doctrine) sub∣stantially Christ's Body, lest that otherwise you fall into Ido∣latry, by worshipping Bread instead of Christ himselfe. (See the seventh Booke.){fleur-de-lys}. Our Fourth Proofe, that the Substance of Bread remaineth, after Consecration, is taken from the Con∣fessed Sensible Effects. SECT. X.

Sixtly; That this matter, whereof wormes are bred and fed, is the same Bread, which was taken before Consecration. So your owne prime Schoole-men, Historians, and Iesuites respectively. If then the Bread, now ingendring wormes, be the Same that was taken to be Consecrated; how say you that, being Consecra∣ted, it is not still the same, our Senses giving Testimony there∣unto? THE FIRST CHALLENGE. HEre you have nothing to answer, but that the Bread, wher∣of new wormes are bred, whether it bee the Same that was, or not, yet being Bread, it is wrought either by aQuomodò fiat haec materia—Thomistae liquot di∣cunt per Conversio∣nem aliquam in  sum, Panem, A iterùm Crea; & hoc verius uare quo supra {fleur-de-lys} V∣quz in 3 Tho. qu. 76.

What? you, who every where teach that none are to conceipt of any Miracle in this Sacrament, without necessary Cause, can you possibly be perswa∣ded that there is, or can be any necessary Cause, why God should worke a Miracle, either of Conversion into, or of New Creation of Bread, for Breeding, or Feeding of wormes? or of Wine, for making such men Drunke, as should taste too largely of the Cup? yea, or else to poyson your Enemy, were heeSee above at  num. 3.

Nay, can it bee lesse than Blasphemy, to say that God worketh Miracles, for the accomplishment of vaine, wicked, and mischievous effects? Farre be it from us to imagine that the Blessed Body of our Lord Christ, who by his Touch cu∣red so many diseases, in the time of his mortality, should now, being glorified, miraculously poyson his Guests whosoever they bee. Beleeve (if you can) that if God wrought (as you say) a Mi∣racle to convert Accidents into Bread, to engender, or nourish vile wormes, that he would not much rather worke a miracle, (if any such miracle were herein to bee expected) to hinder the poy∣soning of his faithfull Communicants. In all this we appeale a∣gaine to true Antiquitie, and require of you to shew, we say not some expresse Testimony of Primitive Fathers, but so much as any intimation or insinuation, were it but by way of a Dreame, of a Miraculous Conversion of the Consecrated Host (when it be∣ginneth to putrifie) by being changed againe into Bread; or of Mice eating the Body of Christ; or that being putrified it should bread wormes; (seeing it were a miracle they should not
bee so bred) or any such kind of Romish Fancies, and delusi∣ons; or otherwise to confesse your Objectours to be miserable Proctours of a vile, and desperate Cause. Yet lest any of you may thinke, that One coming into a Cellar full of new Wine, and made Drunke with the smell thereof, therefore meere Acci∣dents doe Inebriate: your Iesuite will deny this, and tell you that it is theIn Cella Vi∣ria, novis vinis plerà, solus Acc¦odore infectus, me∣t.

At impossibile est Accidens osse prin∣cipium formale producendi substantiam quamcunque, quia Substantia est nobilior quovis Accidentè. A SECOND CHALLENGE, with a Caution. YOur Common and most plausible Objection, to demen∣tate vulgar people, is to perswade them that you cannot at∣tribute Credit to your Senses in this case, without much dero∣gation from Faith. Therefore, for Caution-sake, be it knowne unto you, that wee have not pleaded for the Truth of Senses, as holding nothing credible, but that which may be proved by the Testimony of Senses. This wee utterly abhorre, as the Gulfe of Infidelity, proper to the Athean Sect: for wee accord to that saying of an holy Father, Fides non habet meritum, ubi Ratio aut Sensus habet ex∣perimentum; and also to that other of. Iustin. Exposit. Fidei. Iustine. In which re∣spect we condemne the Incredulity of Thomas, in that he would not beleeve, except hee should See: yet notwithstanding wee, with our Saviour, approve in Thomas, that by Seeing he did be∣leeve. For this is a true Tenet in Divinity, Faith may be (Supra) above right Reason, or Sense; but never (Contra) against either. It was never read that God required of any man a beliefe of any Sensible thing, which was Contrary to the exact judgement of his Senses. And therefore your opposition, in this Case, as it is Sensles, so it is indeed Faithlesse, as wee have already learned from Scripture and Fathers; by whom the Iudgement of Sense hath beene acknowledged to bee, in Sensible Objects, a notable Ground of Faith. All this while wee have said nothing of your professed maner of Existence of Accidents, which you may reade in the Challenge following.
{fleur-de-lys}A THIRD CHALLENGE, Touching the Accidents of Bread and Wine, in this Sacrament. COncerning the Accidents of Bread and Wine in this Sa∣crament, after Consecration, some are such as were before Consecration inherent in them, as to bee Visible, Sa∣vory, Solid, &c. And some are Accessory Impressions and Alterations, which accrew afterwards, as if it shall happen to bee after Consecration, Hot, Cold, Sweet, or Sower, or the like. Wee demand, what thing you do judge that to be, which so hapneth to bee hot or sweet after Consecration? None can deny but this must be either Quality or Quantity, or some materiall Substance. Wee, consulting with two of your owne Iesuites, heare the one maintaining that these two Accidents haveBellarm. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 24. §. Respondeo tra∣ctantur—Si mu∣tatio in Pane Eucha∣ristiae sit sola altera∣tio, ut calefactio, cōdensatio, tum non requiritur materia aut substantia pro sub∣jecto: nam Acci∣dētia omnia pro sub∣jecto habent Quan∣titatem, quae in Sa∣cramento maneat, unde Hostia conse∣crata dicitur alba, sa∣pida, rotunda, parva. Haec enim omnia de∣nominant Quantita∣tem, alioqui non pos∣sit fieri denominatio, non enim Acciden∣tia de seipsis dicun∣su in Concreto, sed solùm de Subjecto, exceptà Quantate, quae dicitur Quanti∣tas & Quanta. Quantity for their Subject; and the o∣ther Lessius Ies. Opusc. de Perfectio∣nibus divinis. lib. 12. cap. 16. num. 112. Alterum Miraculum est circa species, quòd ita Passiones & Im∣pressiones suscipiant aliarum quantitatum, perindè ac si Mate∣riae Panis & Vini remarent, calescunt enim Species, atque frigeseunt, similesque mutationes subeunt. Qui∣dam putant Quantitatem sol esse immediate Subjecth omnium Accidentinum, quod difficile est creditu, quid enim Quantitatis indoli cum illis Qualitatibus? non enim Quantitas haber ullam propensionem ad ca∣lorem, frigus, saporem,  & similia; neque enim illa dicuntur calescere, frigescere, aut benè maleve olere. Confuting this; Because Hotnesse, Sweetnesse, and such like Qualities have no affection to Quantity: meaning, that we cannot call any Quantity Cold, Hot, or Sweet; Where∣unto we willingly subscribe. As for the sayd Qualities, which the latter Iusuite answe∣reth to beIbiden. Mihi semper verius est visum, non solùm Quantitatem, sed & alias Qualitates hîc per se existere, nullique Subjecto niti, ac proinde calorem & frigus, & similes Impressiones extrinsecùs immissas non recipi in Speciebus, tanquam in Subjecto proprio, sed & penetrativè, & mutuo nexu commiscei. mingled with the other Accidents, which were inherent in the Host, before Consecration, the former Iesuit gaine sayeth it, because Accidents are not predicated of them∣selves in the Concrete; to wit, wee say not of Coldnesse it is cold; or of Sweetnesse, it is sweet. but these are spoken of their Subjects, which wee call either Sweet or Gold. And this wee likewise approve. Seeing then, that no Accident can bee predicated, but of some Subject, and this Subject of Coldnesse, Hotnesse, Sweetnesse, Sowernesse, and of other the like Accidents hapning to the same Sacrament, after Con∣secration, cannot bee so called either in respect of Quantity or Quality, it remaineth that the Subject of them must bee a materiall substance, which, as you your selves (we know) will sweare cannot bee the Body of Christ; for you dare not say of it, that it in your touch or tast is either Cold, Sweet, or Sower, You must therefore give us leave to beleeve it to bee still the Substance of Bread. And this our Argument taketh away your Fancy of Accidents without a Subject; else must
you affirme that he, or shee, whosoever shall make the Host, after it bee Consecrated, either Hote, Sweet, or Sowre, doth in so doing make so many Miracles of Accidents, which are void of their Subjects; which unnecessary multiplication of Miracles both your old, and new Schooles have ever controlled. {fleur-de-lys} Our First Proofe, that Bread remaineth Bread in Substance, after Consecration, in this Sacrament, is by the Iudge∣ment of Ancient Fathers. First from due Inferences. SECT. XI. TEstimonies of Ancient Fathers inferre a necessary Con∣sequence, for proofe of the Existence of Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, as might bee proved partly by the repe∣tition of many Arguments premised, and partly by intimati∣on of other Arguments afterwards expressed. But wee shall be content with, those few, which do more properly appertaine to this present Dispute, concerning the nature of a Body. First Irenaeus, speaking of the Eucharist after Consecration, as being not now common Bread, sayd thatIrenaeus, lib. 4. cap. 34. Sicut Panis, qui est à tetrâ, jam non Communis Pa∣nis est, sed Euchari∣stia, ex duabus rebus constans, terren à & coelesti: Sic Corpo∣ra nostra participan∣tia Eucharistiam jam non sunt Corruptibi∣lia, sed spem Resur∣rectionis habentia. It consisteth of an earthly part, and an heavenly: how? even as the Bodies of the Communi∣cants (saith hee) are no more corruptible, having an hope of the Re∣surrection to come. Scan these words, by the Law of Similitude; and it must infallibly follow, that as our Bodies, albeit substan∣tially Earthly, are notwithstanding called Incorruptible, in re∣spect of the Glory and Immortality, in which (through ope) it hath an Interest; Even so the Earthly substance of this Sacra∣ment, being Bread, is neverthelesse indued with a sacred and Divine property of a Sacramentall Representation of Christ's Body. Which Sacrament Origen calling Sanctified meat, saith that theOrigen. in Matth. 15. Ille Ci∣bus, qui sanstificatur per Verbum Dei & Orationem, juxtà id quod habet materi∣able in secessum emit∣titur: And after hee calleth this [Mte¦riale] Materia Panis, super quem dictus est sermo. ibid. Materiall part thereof goeth into the Draught, or seege: which no sanctified heart can conceive of Christ's Body, whereof the Fathers often pronounce, that It goeth not into the Draught. But what is meant by, Materiall in this place, thinke you M. Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 11. Subd. 3. Brerely? namely Magnitude, and other Sensible Accidents, which in regard of their Significations, are materialls. So hee. Very learnedly answered forsooth! If Magnitudo, that is Greatnesse, bee a Materiall thing; bee you so good as tell us what is the matter thereof? for whatsoever is Materiall, hath that appel∣lation from it's Subject matter. Is is the Body of Christ? then must you grant (which wee, with the holy Fathers, abhorre to thinke) that the Body of Christ passeth into the Draught: or is it
Bread? Then farewell Transubstantiation. Nay, will you say, but they are meere Accidents. And we Answer, that it was ne∣ver heard, no not in your owne Schooles, that meere Accidents were called (which are Origen's words in this place) either Meats, or Materialls. Yea, and Origen (that he might be knowne to understaud Materiall Bread) furthermore calleth it now, af∣ter Consecration, Matter of Bread: not of Accidents of Bread, or yet Accidents signifying Bread: for what Papist will say that the Formes of Bread and Wine, in this Sacrament, after Conse∣cration, are Symbols, or Signes, signifying Bread and Wine; and not Symbols of the Body and Blood of Christ? S. Ambrose his Comparison is of like Consequence;Ambros. lib. 4. de Sacrament. cap. 4. Quanto magis est operatorius Sermo Christi, ut sint quae erant, & in aliud con∣vertantur?—Tu eras vetus Creatura, post∣quam consecratus, nova Creatura esse coepisti. As one Baptized had beene an old Creature, and was made a new one, even so (speaking of the Bread and VVine after Consecration) they being changed into another thing, remaine that which they were before. But hee (you know) that was baptized, remaineth after Baptisme in Substance the same man, although, in respect of Spirituall Graces, he suffereth a Change. Of which Testimony moreSee below, ch. 4. Sect. 2. at the let.  hereafter. Cyprian is a Father much alleaged and urged by you, in de∣fence of Transubstantiation; but is now at hand to controll you.Cyprias. lib. de Vnctione. Dedit Do∣minus noster in Men∣sâ, in qua ultimum Convivium cum A∣postolis participavit, propris manibus Pa¦nem & Vinum: in Cruce verò manibus milium corpus tra∣didi vtandum, ut  Apostolis secre∣tiùs impressa sincera veritas & vera since∣rits, exponeret Gen∣tibus, quomodò Pa¦nis & Vinum Caro ejus essent & Sangui; & quibus rationibus Causae effectis con∣renirent, & diversa nomina, vel species ad unam reduceren∣tur essentiam, ut sig∣nificantia & signifi∣cata eisdem vocabu∣lis conferentur. Our Lord gave in this Banquet (saith he) Bread and VVine with his owne hands, when hee partaked thereof with his Apostles: but on the Crosse hee delivered up his Body to the Soul∣diers to be pierced with wounds, to the end, that sincere verity, and true sincerity having an inward impression in the Apostles, hee by them might manifest to the Gentiles, how that Bread and wine is his Body and Blood, and by what meanes there may be agreement betweene Causes, and Effects; and how different names and formes might be reduced to one Essence; that things signifying, and things signified might be called by the same names. So hee. A Catholike Father, as all know; whom if you aske, what Con∣secrated thing it was, which Christ had in his hands, and gave to his Disciples, hee answereth it was Bread, and Wine; and not absolutely that, which he gave up to be Crucified on the Crosse by Souldiers, (namely) his Body, and Blood. If againe you demand of Cyprian, why Christ called the Bread, which he had in his hand, his Body, he readily answereth saying: The things signi∣fying (or Signes) are called by the same names, whereby the things signified are termed. {fleur-de-lys} The Marcian Heretike held Bread and Wine to bee un∣cleane Creatures: Tertullian confuteth them, But how? even by the Bread and Wine used of Christ in the Eucharist; Be∣cause Christ (saith he) did not reject his Creature, wherewith hee represented his owne Body. In which Testimonie the word, [Representeth,] being spoken of the Eucharist, it must needs note it as a thing Consecrated, else could it not be said to
Represent the Body of Christ. And by calling this a Creature representing Christ's Body, he distinguisheth it from Christ's Body. And lastly, the Heretike teaching the Substance; and not the Accidents of the same Creature, Bread, to be uncleane, and Tertullian disproving him by the Sacramentall Bread, must as necessarily have meant a continuing of the Substance of Bread, as all the Lawes of Arguing do proclame; which teach all Answerers and Confuters to speake ad Idem. {fleur-de-lys} ACasaubon.

Protestant of admirable learning, unfolded unto you the Iudgement of Antiquitie, from the Testimonies of divers Fathers, in saying of this Sacrament, after Consecration, that The Bread, by being divided, is diminished: that, It is delivered by fragments: that these are so little, that they are to be called rather Bitts, than Parts. Thus they spake expressely of Bread Consecrated; but to say that you eate Bitts and Fragments of whitenesse, of Roundnesse, and other Accidents, who is so ab∣surd among your selves? and to affirme the same of Christ's Body, who is so impious? {fleur-de-lys} Onely it will be our duety to Answer the Objection of Doctor Heskins, for proofe of the Corporall presence of Christ his Body; who produceth the Cautions, which Pope Cle∣ment, in his second Epistle, gave to the Priests and Deacons, concerning the Fragments, and pieces of that which he cal∣leth Fragments of the Lords Body; Charging them,Dr. Heskins in his Parliament of Christ. That no Mice-dung may be seene among the Fragments of the Lords Portion: Nor that they be Suffered to remaine rotten through their negligence. We Answer; First, by the words, Fragments of Christ's Portion, are to be understood either meere Acci∣dents, and then are your Disputers unconscionable, to argue from Fragments of meere Accidents, for a Substantiall Exi∣stence of the Body of Christ: Or else thereby you must be∣lieve they meant properly Christ's Body, and then should you be altogether blasphemous, to teach a Body of Christ rent in∣to Fragments, and Portions; and the same pieces of the same Body to be in themselves subject unto the pollution of Mice∣dung, Putrification, and Rottennesse. Here, indeed, were there some use of the admirableBelow in the fourth Booke.  Nose of Ioane Martlesse, above mentioned by your Iesuite, to smell out the Abo∣mination of this your Romish Doctrine. Somewhat more of this Point when wee shall appeale to the Canon of that famous Councel ofSee  c. 2. §. 10. in the Collenge. Nice. In the Interim wee may well thinke, that that Primitive Church, which abhorred to think the Body of Christ should be Devoured, or passe into the Draught, would never have consented (as* Shee did) to the Burying of the Sacrament, which remained after the Commu∣nion; if they had conceived it to bee Really the Body of Christ.
Another Inference wee may take from Antiquity, in her calling this Sacrament [Pignus] a Pledge (soHierom. in 1. Cor. 11. Dominus passionis suae ulti∣mam nobis Comme∣morationem, & me∣moriam reliquit: quēadmodùm siquis peregre proficiscens aliquod pignus ei, quem diligit, derelin∣quat, ut possit eius amicitias, & beneficia commemorare.

A perfect Argument of the Bodily Absence of Christ, by virtue of the Relation betweene the Person and his Pledge; And so doth alsoPrimasius, See-Booke 5. Chap. 9. §. . Primasius. The third and last Classis of Fathers may be viewed in the Section following. A Confirmation of the same Iudgement of the Fathers, acknow∣ledging in expresse termes, Bread to remaine, after Con∣secration, in Substance the same. The First Father is THEODORET. SECT. XII. THeodoret maketh a Dialogue, or Conference betweene two Parties, being in Controversie about the humane and bodily nature of Christ; the one is named Eranistes, upon whom is imposed the person of an Heretike, for Defence of the Sect of the Eutychians, who (falsly) held, That the Body of Christ, af∣ter his Ascension, being glorified, was swallowed up of his Deitie, and continued no more the same humane and Bodily Essence, as be∣fore his Resurrection it had beene. The other Party and Dis∣puter is named Orthodoxus, signifying the Defender of the Truth of the Catholike Doctrine; which Person Theodoret himselfe did sustaine, in behalfe of the Catholike Church. In this Dis∣pute the Heretike is brought in, for Defence of his Heresie, ar∣guing thus; Even as Signes in the Eucharist, after the words of Invocation (or Consecration) are not the same, but are changed in∣to the Body of Christ: even so, after his Ascension, was his Body changed into a Divine [,] meaning, Substance of a Divine Essence. Which both your Romanistes and Protestants confesse to have beene the Doctrine of these Heretikes. This was that Heretike his Objection. The Orthodoxe, or Catholike (which was Theodoret himselfe) cometh to answer, promising to catch the heretike, as he saith, in his owne Snare, by retorting his Argument of Similitude against him, thus: Theod. Dial. 2. c. 24. Non post san∣ctificationem mysti∣ca signa .  post. Sic illud Corpus Christi priorem habet Formam, Figuram, Circumscriptionem, & (de summatim dicam) : etiamsi post resurrectionem immortale, & immune ab om∣ni corruptione. Nay, But as the mysticall Signes in the Eucharist, after San∣ctification,
depart not from their former nature, but continue in their former Figure, Forme and [] that is, Substance. So the Body of Christ, after the Resurrection, remaineth in its former Figure, Forme, Circumscription, and [], or Substance which it had before. You may perceive that the Assertion, set downe in the name of a Grand Heretike, is absolutely your Romish Profession for Transubstantiation at this day, (to wit) Bread is changed after Consecration into the Substance of Christ's Body; and that also the Assertion of Theodoret, in the person of the Catholike Professor, being flat contradictory, is as absolutely the Doctrine of Protestants, defending that Bread after Conse∣cration remaineth in Substance the same. Wherefore if ever, it now concerneth your Disputers to Free your Romish Article from Heresie: which divers have undertaken to do by their Answeres, but alas! so absurdly, that any reasonable man must needs laugh at their Answer; and so falsly, as which any man of conscience must as necessarily detest. The Principall Answer is that, which yourNon loquitur de substantiâ, quae di∣stinguitur contra Ac∣cidentia, & quam in Categoriâ posuit A∣ristoteles; sed de Es∣sentiâ, & naturâ Ac∣cidentium. Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 27. §. Sed me. Cardinall giveth, that Theodoret, in saying that Bread remaineth the same in Figure, Forme, and ; By [] meant not Substance, pro∣perly understood, but the Essence of Accidents. So he. {fleur-de-lys}Or as yourGordon. Ies. lib. Controv. 4. cap. 4. num. 12. De signorum (id est, Accidentium) substantia loquitur. Iesuite saith, Thesubstance of the Signes, which are Accidents. An answer (by your leave) No oriously, Ri∣diculously, and Heretically False. First, Notoriously false, because the Argument of Theodo∣ret, being taken from a Similitude, and every Similitude con∣sisting of two Propositions, the first called Protasis, and the o∣ther Apodosis, it is necessary by the Rule of Logike; (as you know) that the words and termes, betokening the same Simili∣tude, be used in the same signification in both Propositions. But in the Apodosis of Theodoret, which is this: So the Body of Christ, after the Resurrection, remaineth the same in Figure, Forme, and ; by the word [] was meant properly Substance, because this was , the maine point in Question betweene Theodoret and the Heretike, viz. whether the Substance of Christ's Body continued the same, which it had beene in time before his Resurrection; (the Heretike denying it, and Theodoret proving it to be absolutely still the same in Substance:) and not whether the same onely in Quantities, and Accidents; for those the A∣postle teacheth to be alterable,1. Cor. 15. 34. Corruption putting on Incorrup∣tion, Mortality Imortality, and shame Glory. Therefore in the Protasis, and first Proposition of that comparison of Theodoret, (which was this, As the Bread remaineth the same in Figure, Forme, and ) the word [] can have no other signification than Substance, properly taken. Secondly, Ridiculously false, because in reckoning Figure and Forme, which are knowne to bee Accidents, and ad∣ding
[] this necessarily is opposed to the former Two, as Substance to Accidents. Nor was there (we suppose) ever any so unlearned, who did adde the word [] to Formes, and Fi∣gures, but hee therby meant to distinguish it as a Substance from its Accidents. Thirdly, Heretically false; for what was the Heresie of the Eutychians? tell us; They (sayAlphonsua à Ca∣stro, de Haeres. Eurych. Negabant Christum habuisse naturam hu∣manam; tantùm in eo ponentes naturam divinam. you) held that Christ (namely after his Resurrection) had not an humane nature, but onely Di∣vine. Which word, Humane Nature, doth principally imply the Substantiall nature of Man; and therefore in his compari∣son, made for the illustration of that Heresie concerning Bread, after Consecration, in Figure, Forme, and [] the same word [] had the same signification of Substance, as your Master Brerely afterwards is compelled to confesse: who, to the end he may disgrace Theodoret, rudely and wildly taketh upon him to justifie the Heretikes speech to be Catholike, for proofe of Transubstantiation. Wherefore Theodoret, in his Answer, Retorting (as hee him∣selfe saith) the Heretikes Comparison, against him, did, by , likewise understand Substance, else had he not disputed ad Idem; but by a shamefull Tergiversation had betraid his Catholike Cause unto that pernitious Heretike. Much like as if one should use this Comparison following. As the Moone-shine in the water (in the opinion of the Vulgar) is truly of the same bignesse with the Moone in the Firmament; so a feigned friend is equal∣ly as loving as is a Faithfull. And another retorting the same, should confute him, saying; Nay, but as the Moon-shine in the water, is not of the same bignesse with the Moone in the Fir∣mament; even so a feigned friend is not equally loving as is a Faithfull. Here the word [Love] being taken for Loyall Affe∣ction by the Objectour, if the sense thereof should be perverted by the Answerer and Retorter, to signifie Lust, the Disputers might be held to be little better than those Two inAlter hireum mulget: alter cribram supponit. A. Gellius, where such an Objectour is compared to a man milking an Hee-goat, (or if you will, a Bull) and the Answerer to another holding under a Sive. {fleur-de-lys}Observe also that Arius the Heretike, be∣ing required to tell What is Substance (Greeke ) an∣swered, That is Substance, [] whereby a thing doth sub∣sist. AndAthan. Tom. 1. Disput. cont. Aium, ubi Arius: . Cui Athanss, . Athanasius himselfe approved hereof, saying, Thou hast answered rightly: This could they not have said, if that the word [] had not beene universally taken in the Greeke Church, aswell among Orthodoxe, as among Heretikes: for that which giveth a Subsisting to other things (as you your selves will not deny) is to be properly a Substance. {fleur-de-lys} Here had wee fixed a Period, but that wee againe espied one Master Brerely (a Romish Priest) coming against us with a full careere, who after that he had beeneVid Protestants Appeale, Book. 2. ch. 2. §. 10. confuted, for urging the
former Objection, notwithstanding, concealing the Answer, he blusheth not to regest the same; albeit, as one conscious to him∣selfe of the futility therof, he leaveth it presently, falling foule upon Theodoret, as though that Father had beene in some di∣stemper, when he so, writ:In his Liturg of the Masse. Tract. 2. §. 2 subd. 3. p. 254. saying, first, that Theodoret used that his Retortion in hisNot so, for he was now not ia per∣sonall Dispute, but de∣liberately writing a∣gainst th Heresia of the Eutychiant. heate of Dispute. Then hee taketh part with the Heretike, saying, It is not likely that an Heretike should have urged against a Catholike sentence for Transubstan∣tiation, as for a point of Faith well knowne, if the same Doctrine had beene then either unknowne, or else condemned, as False. So hee, who might aswell have reasoned, in the behalfe of the Sad∣duces, condemned by Christ, saying: It is not likely that they would so expressely have denyed that there ae any Spirits, in their Dispute against Christ, if that Doctrine had beene then either un∣knowne or condemned as False, by the Church of God, among the Iewes. And yet it is certaine that the Heresie of the Sadduces was judged execrable in that Church. Now if the Eutychian Heretike finde such Patronage at the hands of your Priest, alas! what will become of the Father Theodoret? Hearken, Theodoret being an Orthodoxe Bishop (saith hee) could not have propounded the Heretikes Argument, as groun∣ded upon the Churches received Doctrine of Transubstantiation, had the same beene then unknowne, and reputed False. So he, who if hee had not lost his Logike, would certainly have argued con∣trarily, saying; Theodoret, being an Orthodoxe and Catholike Bishop, would never have set downe an Objection for Transubstan∣tiation, in the name of a ranke Heretike, and after himselfe impug∣ned and confuted the same, except he had knowne it to be flatly re∣pugnant to the Catholike Church in his time. Wherefore if you be men of Faith, and not rather of Faction, let the miserable perplexities of your Disputers, discovered both here, and throughout this whole Treatise, move you to renounce them, as men of prostituted Consciences; and their Cause, as forlorne of all Truth. For a further Evidence, take unto you an Answer of your Ie∣suite Valentia, to this and the like Testimonies of Antiquity: It is not to be held any marvell (saithValent. Ies. l. 2. de Transub. c. 7.

So hee; and this hee calleth a Briefe and plaine Answer. And so it is, whereby, in granting that Transubstantiation had not beene so Anciently handled in the Church, he plainly confuteth your now Romane Church, which judgeth it to have beene alwayes an Article of Faith. And affirming that the same Fathers Hand∣led not the point of purpose, it is as plainly confuted by Theodo∣ret, who in this Dispute did not argue against the Heretike
extemporall speech personally, but deliberately and pun∣lly by writing, and therefore of Purpose. The Second Father expresly defending the Existence of Bread in this Sacrament, after Consecration, is Pope GELASIVS. SECT. XIII. THis Author have Protestants called Pope Gelasius, and ur∣ged his Testimony.

Gelasius Bishop of Cae∣srea, saith your Cardinall Bellarmine. Contrarily yourBaronius him∣selfe tendeth that it was not that Pope Gelasius, Anno 496 num. 123. &c. yet comming to answer to the Sentence of Gel∣siu doth expound toe doubtful words there of by the phrases of Pope Gelasius, ex E∣pist. ad Penos, & Dardan.

Sacramenta certa,  corporis & sanguinis Christi divina res est, propter quodper eadem divinae efficimur participes naturae, & tamen non definit esse substantia vel natura panis, & via; & certè imago & similitudo corporis & sanguinis Christin in Actione mysticâ celebratur. And againe. Permanent in proprietate naturae. The Sacraments of the Body, and Blood of Christ, being Divine things, yet cease not to bee the nature and substance of Bread and Wine. In Answer whereunto, both your foresaidBellar. & Baton quo supra. At dicit Gelasius. In Divinaru transcunt Spiritu sancto perficiente substantiam, permanent tamen suâ proetate naturae: [By this it may bee seene, indeed, that this Gelasius was a Latine Author, (but what is this to the Greeke Theodoret?) when the Latine Language was not so perfect, and that he did use the word equivocall, but yet so; that the matter it selfe doth challenge a proper use thereo, when hee speaketh of the Substancè of Bread, for confutation of the same heresie.] Cardinalls here (as before) by Substance interpret Accidents: one of them labouring to prove that Ge∣lasius somewhere else called Accidents, Substances. Were this granted, yet the Argument, which Gelasius hath in hand, will
compell the understanding Reader to acknowledge in this his Sentence a proper signification of Substance. For where as the Heretike Eutyches taught that Christ his Body was changed into the Substance of his Divinity, after the Resurrection, and that the substance of his Body remained no more the same; Gelasius confuteth him by a Similitude, and Comparison, viz. That as the Substance of Bread remaineth after Consecration: So Christ his Bodily Substance remained after the Resurrection. Wherein if the word, Substance, bee not in both places taken properly, Gelasius should have made but a mad Reason, as any reaso∣nable man will confesse. For albeit Similitudes doe not amble alwayes on foure feet, yet if they halt upon the right foot, (which is the matter in Question) they are to be accounted per∣fit Dissimilitudes. MasterMaster Brereley Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd. 3. pag. 259. Brerely would have you to know, that this Gela∣sius (whosoever he were) writeth against the same Eutychian He∣resie, that Theodoret did; and thereupon useth accordingly, to his like advantage, the words Substance, and Nature, in the same sense, as did Theodoret. So he. And he saith true; and therefore must wee assure our selves of the consent of this Gelasius with us, un∣till you shall be able to free your selves from our former Inter∣pretation of Theodoret. But Master Brerely opposeth against us another sentence of Gelasius, from whence he concludeth that Gelasius held Transubstantiation: so that Gelasius must rather contradict himselfe, than that he shall not consent to the Romish Tenet. Whereas, indeed, he saith no more than, in a mysticall sense, any Protestant must, and will allow, viz. that The Sacra∣ment is a Divine thing, and that whosoever eate spiritually the Body of Christ, are by it made partakers of the blessing of his Di∣vine Nature, which dwelleth in Christ bodily, saith the Apostle, So Gelasius. Whereof copiously throughout the fift Booke. To which Saying of Gelasius, touching the Eucharist, is an∣swerable a like Saying of Gregory Nyssen, concerning Baptisme, calling it aGreg Nyssen.

Two other Testimonies from Antiquity, for the expresse acknow∣ledgement of the Existence of Bread after Consecration, in the Sacrament; Chrysostome, and Bertram: to whom is added Ephraimius. SECT. XIIII. CHrysostome his words are these, thatChrysost.

Florence, andSo your Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, lib. 2. de Euch. as he is cited. Canterbury. To whom may bee adjoyned the Author of that Vnperfect worke, still standing under the name of Chrysostome, and by you upon any occasion objected against us; wherein it is expresly sayd, thatAuthor operis imperfecti, in Matth.

The True Body of Christ is not contained within these san∣ctified Vessels, but the mysterie of his Body. It seemeth that your later Parisian Divines were offended with others, who would have these words utterly dashed out of their last Editions, which were published in the former; as you have beene admo∣nished by oneDr. Iames in his Specimen Corrupte∣larum, &c.

Bertram is our next witnesse from Antiquity, being about 800. yeeres agoe, and never noted of Errour anciently, untill these later times of Booke-butchery (that we may so call your Index Expurgatorius)Bertramus Gallus circa Annum Domini 810. de Corpore & Sanguine Christi.

But why? what saith he? He maintaineth (saith yourBertramus vult Eucharistiam esse Panis & Vini substantian, quae figuram, similitudnem, & appellationem Sanguinis Christi gerit. Senens. Biblioth. lib. 6. Anno 196. Senensis) that the Eucharist is the substance of Bread and Wine. And indeed so hee doth in hisBertramus.

This Author undergoeth also the Censure of the Vniversity of Doway, which, confes∣sing him to have beene a Catholike Priest, framed divers An∣swers,
whereby they meant to prevent all Objections, which Protestants might peradventure urge, under the Authority of this Author Bertram. But how? Marke this Romih Profession of answering Protestans, as often as they shall iit in the se∣stmonies of ancient Writers:Iulicium Vni∣vsitts Ducensis, Bertrm Catholicus Presyter, & Mo∣nachus Corvinensis—a Chocis verebas lari∣mos  erro∣res, & extenaemus, excuemus, excogi∣tto Commen ae∣pè negemus, & cn∣modum es sensum assingamas, dunob∣acur  Dispa∣onibus cum Ader∣sjs.

Let us (say they) in Dsputa∣tion with our Adversaries, objecting ancient Authors, tolerate many of their Errours, extenuate and excuse them; yea and often∣times, by some devised Comment or shift, deny them, as also by feig∣ning to apply some apt sense unto them. So that Vniversiie.

Pag. 415. Edit. Augustae Vindelic. 1601. The Body of Christ, which is received by the faithfull, loseth no∣thing of it's sensible substance, nor is it separable from grace; as Baptisme, which is spirituall, being intirely one in it selfe, preserveth the property of it's sensible substance, (I meane wa∣ter) and loseth not that which it was. So hee. Expresly re∣veiling unto us in what Sense Antiquity called Bread the Bo∣die of Christ; namely (as other Fathers, in good number, have already unfolded) because it is a Sacrament represent∣ing Christs Body. For hee clearly speaketh of that, which loseth nothing of it's sensible substance, no more than water in Baptisme doth lose ought of it's sensible substance. Which Analogie of the Eucharist with Baptisme will in the last * Booke (in a full Synopsis) give an upshot to the whole Cause, concerning the generall Iudgement of the Fathers from point to point. See the like Argument of Cyrill of Ie∣rusalem afterwards, Chap. 4. Sect. 4.
CHAP. IV. Answers to the Objections of Romish Doctours, taken from the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, for Transubstantiation. Or, an Antidote to expell all their poysonsome Pre∣tences in that behalfe. SECT. I. THis our Antidote is compounded of five Ingredients, used for the Discovery of the Vnconscionablenesse of your Disputers, in their Objecting the Testimonies of Fathers under false Pretences. First, upon their terming the mysticall Act A Worke of Omnipotencie. Secondly, their denying of the Eucha∣rist to bee Naked and Bare Bread. Thirdly, in forbidding the Communicants to rely upon the Iudgement of their Senses. Fourthly, in their mentioning the Change of Bread and Wine, in this Sacrament, and calling it Transmutation, Transition, and the like. Fiftly and lastly, in forcing of the speeches of Fathers, which may seeme to make for Transubstantiation, as absolutely spoken of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which the same Fa∣thers do apply as well to the Sacrament of Baptisme, and also to other sacred Rites, wherein you beleeve there is not any Sub∣stantiall Change at all. The First Vnconscionablenesse of your Romish Disputers, in ob∣jecting the Fathers speeches of an Omnipotent Worke in this Sacrament, for proofe of Transubstantiation. SECT. II. A Worke of Omnipotencie is attributed by divers Fathers to the Change, which is made in this Sacrament, which we likewise confesse.Ambros.

[Whereas Naturâ mutatus signifieth not the Substance, but the Condition: Et factus Caro, is no more than a Sacramentall and mysticall Being of the Body of Christ, as all other places of Cyprian shewe.] Cyprian spea∣keth
of a Change in nature, by Divine Omnipotencie,Aug. de Trini∣tate. lib. 3. Non san∣ctificat ut sit mag∣num Sacramentum, nisi operante spiritu Dei, quae per illos, cum haec omnia Cor∣porales motùs sint, Deus operatur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 24. §. Sed Paulo. Augu∣stine reckoning it among God's miracles, saith that This Sacra∣ment is wrought by the Spirit of God. Accordingly we heare Chrysost. hom. 83 Non sunt hu∣manae vtutis haec o∣pera, quae tunc in idâ Coeâ confecit, ipse nunc quo{que}, operatur, ipse perficit, mini∣strorum nos crdinem tenemus: qui vera aec sanctificat at{que} transmutat ipse est. This is objected by Mr. Brerely, Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd. a. pag. 111. Liturg. Chrysostome proclaiming, that These are not workes of humane power: Hee that changeth, and transmuteth now, is the same that hee was in his last Supper. Each one of these Testimonies are principally alleged by your Disputers, as the strongest fortres∣ses for defence of your Article of Transubstantiation, and being taken altogether, they are esteemed as a Bulwarke impregna∣ble; but why?See above in his objecting of Am∣brose. Because (saith your Cardinall) Omnipoten∣cie is not required to make a thing to be a Signe Significant. So he. Wee answer first from your owne Confessions, and then from the Fathers themselves. There are two workes observable in every Sacrament; one is to be a Signe of an Invisible grace, promised by God: the other to be a Seale and Pledge therof, as all Protestants hold; and (as your most opposedCalvia. Sem∣per memoriâ repe∣tendum est, Sacra∣menta nihil quàm ustrumentales esse confetendae nobis gratiae Causas. An∣tid in Conc. Trid. Sess. 7 Can. 5. Calvin teacheth) an Instrumentall cause of conferring grace to the partakers of the Sacraments. In both which Respects there is required an Omnipotencie of a Di∣vine work, without which the Element cannot be changed into a Sacrament, either to signifie, or yet to seale, much lesse to convey any grace of God unto man. And (that wee may take you along with us) It is the Doctrine of your Church, with common consent (saith your RomaneSolus Deus (communi Consen∣su) instituere Sacra∣menta ex authori∣tate potest, quae gra∣tiam efficiunt, aut etiam infallibiliter significant. Bellar. l. 1. de Sacram. in Gen. cap. 23. Cardinall) that God onely can by his Autho∣rity institute a Sacrament, because hee onely can give them power of conferring grace, and of Infallible signification thereof. So hee Well then, aswell infallible Signification of Grace, as the effica∣cious conveyance of Grace, is the worke of the same Omnipo∣cencie. To this purpose more plainly your English Cardinall Alan, speaking (as hee saith) from the judgement of Di∣vines, Card. Alan de Sacram. in Gen. c. 17. & 18. Sacramenti Institutionem neque ad Pontificem; ne{que} ad ullam Creaturam pertinere: nec hoc solum sed etiam, &c—propter solam significationem Gratiae, quam Sacramentis omnibus Communem diximus, dbebant etiam vetera Sacramenta determinari per applicationem mortis Christi: quia licet quidem in Creaturis, ad signationem effectuum spiritualium, aptitudo quaedam sit, tamen ista aptitudo non nisi a divinâ institutione determinaur ad peculiarem effectum. Habet enim Aqua ex natura sua ut munditiem signi∣ficet, at ut determinatè purgationem animae à peccato originali significet, & hominis sanctificationem reprae∣sentet; divinae tantùm institutionis est, per quam elevatur Creatura haec supra naturae consuetudinem, non solùm quoad vim operandi, sed etiam significandi. Non potest Sacramentum nisi à solo Deo Ordinari, quià habent Sacramenta Supernaturalem Effectum, ut in veteri lege, quae debant munditiem legalem. These (hee saith) that he speaketh, Ex Theologorum Sententia. telleth you that Although there be an aptnesse in every Creature to beare a signification of some spirituall effect, yet cannot the aptnesse be determinatly applyed unto any peculiar effect, no not so much as to signifie the outward Cleannesse of mans Body (Sacramentally) without a Divine Institution; much lesse to represent mans sanctification: but being so determinated and or∣dained of God, the Creature (saith hee) is elevated above the Cu∣stome of nature, not only in respect of the worke of sanctification, but even of signification also. So hee; and that as well as wee
could wish: for this Omnipotent Change of a Creature into a Sacrament, and this Iustrumentall Cause of conferring Sancti∣fying Grace, to the Faithfull Communicant, is the Generall Doctrine of all Protestants. But what Change shall we thinke? Of the Substance of Bread into the Substance of Christs Body, as you teach? No; but asBooke 2. Chap. 3. §. 6. before Isidore sayd, The Change of visible things, by the spirit of God, into a Sacrament of Christs Body. So hee. This being a Change from a Property naturall into a Property Supernaturall, which Change is Divine, al∣beit but Accidentall: whereunto accordeth that objected place ofSee above at the letter (c) Augustine, that This is sanctified by the Spirit of God to bee a Sacrament. Seeing then that both Divine power and authority is requi∣red in every Sacrament, to make it either infallibly significant, or else efficaciously profitable to man; and that it is by the same Divine power that the Element is Changed, by being Elevated from a common, unto a spirituall and divine property of a Sa∣cramentall Signification, as one of your Cardinalls hath sayd: What an unconscionablenesse is it then in your Disputers; from the termes of Omnipotencie and Divine working, which is neces∣sarily in all Sacraments, to conclude a Change of the Element of Bread, by Transubstantiation, as you have heard. But much more transparent will their Vnconscionablenesse bee, if we consult with the Objected Fathers themselves. For first Ambrose, who observeth an Omnipotencie in the Change of this Sacrament, explaineth himselfe what kind of Efficacy hee meant, viz. such, thatAmbros. lib. 4 de Sac. am c. 4. Si tan¦ta vis est in sermone Domini, ut incipian ess quae non erant quantò magis Ope∣ratorius est, ut sint quae erant, t in ald convertantur?—Tu ipse eras vers homo, postquàm consecratus eras, no vus homo esse coe∣pisti. The things changed into a divine Sacra∣ment are still the same, which they were before (namely) according to their natural property. Which one Clause doth so strangle all conceit of Transubstantiation, that it may seeme you have some reason to wipe this Testimony of S. Ambrose out of your new These words [ut sint quae erant] are wanting in the Roman and Paris E∣ditions, Anno 1603 as Bishop Vsher  nesseth in his Answer to the Tesuit. Editions: notwithstanding, by Gods providence; so much of Ambrose his tongue is preserved, even in the same place, as will convince your Objectors of wilfull Falshood; telling you by a Similitude, that the Change of Bread in this Sacrament is like to the Change, whereby a Christian RegenerateSee above at (1) of an old Creature is made a new Creature: which is (as every Chri∣stian knoweth) not a change in the substantiall nature of man, but in the Accidentall properties. So this Bread of a common bodily Food is made Sacramentall. And the same Father who said of a man, that by Baptisme hee is made a new Creature, saith also of this Sacrament, thatPer  or Explica∣tie; Corpus signifi∣catur. By Benediction Bread is made ano∣ther nature, (namely) of an Elementall become Sacramentall, as you have heard; and as his owne words import, After Consecra∣tion the Body of Christ is Signified: and that, which was Wine, Is called Blood.

Brerely allow∣eth of, as for example: a Surplesse being commanded by law∣full Authority, the use thereof becometh necessary, so that the nature therof is Changed, yet not in the Substance of the thing, but in the legall necessity of the use. {fleur-de-lys} And what will you thinke of that of Saint Hilarie? say∣ing of all persons Regenerate, thatHilar de Trin. lib 8 Per naturam sidei unum sumus, renati ad innocenti∣am & immortalita∣tem regenerati in u∣mus AEternitatis na∣turam. By the nature of faith they are changed into Immortality, and into one nature of Eter∣nity. In both which the Proprieties and qualities of things are called the Natures thereof. In which respect we embrace the saying of Saint Ambrose, when hee affirmeth theAmbros. de jis qui initiantur my∣ster. cap. ult. Major benedictionis omnis virtus quàm na∣turae, quià benedi∣ctione etiam natura ipsa mutatur. Na∣ture of Bread to bee changed in this Sacrament. Certainly, e∣ven as it is in all other Mysteries, wherin (as Saint Augustine speaketh)Aug. Tom. 9. in Sem de Cataclys∣mo. Accedit verbum ad elementum, & fit Sacra∣mentum. As much as to say, the Element (as Bread) is Changed into a Sacrament; (asSee above Booke 2. cap. 2. §. 16. Isidore spake) which is cal∣led the Body of Christ, because of the Sacramentall property of speech, calling the Signe by the name of the thing signi∣fied; as the same * Father, with divers Others hath amply declared. {fleur-de-lys} But to come neerer, Answer us but this one Question. Wher∣as all learning alloweth this saying, that in Baptisme the nature of the Element, and the nature of the Sacrament are different, whereupon it is sayd; The word coming to the Element maketh it a Sacrament: when wee shall say of the water in Baptisme
that the Nature of it, as of a Sacrament, is more excellent than, is the nature of it, as it is a meere Element; whether doth not the word, Nature, attributed to the Sacrament, justly accord unto the Phrase of Cyprian, in the case of the Eucharist? and so much the rather, because that Cyprian, in the words immedi∣atly following the Testimony objected, doth fully confute Transubstantiation by a Similitude; comparing the Humanity, and Deity of Christ with the Naturall and Spirituall parts of this Sacrament, to wit;Et sicut in persona Christi hu∣manitas videbatur, & latebat Divinitas; ità Sacramento visi∣bili ineffabilitèr di∣vina se effundit essen∣tia. Author. Coenae. Ibid. §. Quarto. As in Christ himselfe true humani∣tie appeared in his flesh, and his Deity was hid: (This was the and first part of this Similitude; the  and next part followeth) Even so into this visible Sacrament the Divine Essence infuseth it selfe. So hee, which, by the law of a Simi∣litude, must stand thus: Even so Bread in this Sacrament is seene, and the Spirituall operation of Gods power therein to the Faithfull is Invisible. Like as we may say of the preaching of the Word of God to the Faithfull; The words are audible, and sensible, but because of the inward working of Gods Spi∣rit, for the Conversion of Mans soule, it is calledRom. 1. 16. The power of God unto salvation: as likewise Baptisme is made the Lavacr of Regeneration; whereof Gregory Nyssen affirmeth thatGreg. Nyssen. erat. de Baptism. Di∣vinum Lavacrū mag∣num quid operatur per Benedictionem, & mirabiles producit Effectus. It worketh marvellously by benediction, and produceth marvellous Effects. As for Augustine, and Chrysostome (not to bee super∣fluous) every Protestant doth both beleeve and professe (name∣ly) a Divine Operation of God, both by changing the Element into a Sacrament, and working by that Sacrament Spirituall Ef∣fects, to the good of Mans soule. {fleur-de-lys} A Vindication of divers Testimonies of Saint Cyprian, by Romish Torturers forced, for proofe of Transubstantiation. BVt you have not done with Cyprian, he is found saying, concerning this Sacrament, thatCyprian de Coena Dom. Chri∣stus usquè hodie ve∣rissimum, Sanctissi∣mum suum Corpus creat, sanctificat & benedicit, & piè su∣mentibus dividit. Ob∣jected by Dr. Hes∣kins Parl. Booke 2. Chap. 8. Christ daily Crea∣teth his most true, and most holy Body, sanctifieth and blesseth it. This, in the Opinion of your Objector, must needs prove a proper Existence of Christ in the Eucharist, because Christ createth not an imaginary Body, but that which is called a most true Body. Which words, notwithstanding, in true sense, make nothing against our Defence, but against your Ro∣mish Tenets, as much as any Protestant can require. This is soone tryed. The words of Cyprian are, that Christ doth Create his most true Body: the onely Question is of the word [Create,] whereunto it is to be referred properly? This must be either to Bread, or to Christ's Body: and your Car∣dinall abhorring to say that Christ's Body is properly created in
this Sacrament,Bell. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 9. In verbis Cypriani illa, Creas, sanctisicas, be∣nedicis, referuntur ad materiam, unde consicitur Corpus Christi: agimus enim gratias, quod per Christum primò pa∣nem crëet, deindè per eundem sanctificat & benedicat, con∣vertendo in Corpus suum—Quod autem Cyprianus loquitur de vero Corpore suo non de signo, patet ex eo, quòd vera∣cissimum illud ap∣pellat. [Wee grant that Christ spake of his true body, for this Sacrament wee say is a figure, not of a fan∣tasticall, but of a sub∣stantiall Body.] Answereth that the words Create, San∣ctifie, and Blesse, are to be referred to Bread, which is first Crea∣ted, (saith he) before it is converted into Christ's Body. If then Cyprian by the words, Christ's Body, meant Bread, which is the Signe of his Body, is it not a wilfull blindnesse in your Disputers, to conclude from a Signe the reall presence of a Body? especially from this Father S. Cyprian, who teacheth every Christian how to interpret the sense of Christ's words, in calling Bread his Body, and Wine his Blood, viz.Cyprian de Vnctione. Dedit Do∣minus in mensa, in qua ultimum cum Apostolis participa∣vit Convivium, pro∣prijs manibus Panem & Vinum, in Cruce vero manibus mili∣tum corpus tradidit vulnerandum, ut in Apostolis exponeret quomodo Vinum & Panis corpus esset & sanguis Christi; & quibus rationibus causae cum effectibus convenirent, & di∣versa nomina vel species ad unam re∣ducerentur essentiam, & significata & signi∣ficantia eisdem o∣cabulis censerentur. Things signifying, (as Signes) and things signified, are called by the same termes, or names. What is, if this be not our Protestant Doctrine? And were it that Cyprian could possibly have meant a Crea∣ting of Christ's Body, in this Sacrament, properly; yet could not such our Opposers have bewrayed more stupiditie, or else obstinacie, than by urging this Sentence, whereby two Arti∣cles of your Councel of Trent are absolutely strangled. The first is Transubstantiation, which (as you confesse) is of Some∣thing Pre-existent: Whereas Creation, (as all know) is from a meere Nothing. The second Tridentine Article is, that the Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, is whole in the whole Host, and in every part thereof. But Cyprian saith of that Body, which hee calleth Created, that It is divided. Wee have light upon another sentence of Cyprian, obje∣cted out of the same place, and as vehemently pressed, as any other out of Cyprian,Cyprian de Coe∣nae Dom. (in the place objected, Ineffabiliter Sacramento visibili divina se infundit essentia, ut esset Re∣ligioni circa Sacra∣menta devotio, ut ad veritatem cujus cor∣pus & sanguis Sacra∣menta sunt syncerior paeret accessus. Ob∣jected by Dr. Heskins in his Parliament of Christ. The Divine essence (saith Cypri∣an) infuseth it selfe into this Sacrament, that wee should have a religious devotion towards it, that a more sincere addresse may be had to be the Truth, whereof the Body and Blood are Sacraments. So he. Now that you may know our willingnesse to go a∣long with you in the exposition of this Sentence, so farre as either the sense of the words will beare, or Cyprian his owne direction will permit. Wee grant, first, that the Divine Essence, which is the di∣vine power of Christ, is exercised in every Sacrament, by making it effectuall to the salvation of the Communicants. Secondly, that by the word, Verity, or Truth, is meant the Reality of his Body and Blood. And Thirdly, that every one that approacheth to this Sacrament, ought to come with a Religious Devotion, and sincere affection. The onely diffe∣rence is, how Christ's Body and Blood are said to bee Sa∣craments of the Reality of his Body and Blood, here mentio∣ned? and your onely Answer is, that Christ is a figure and signe of himselfe, as hee is in this Sacrament; which figment is easily confuted by a Catholike and universall doctrine of all Christian Churches, which is, that every Sacrament is a visible Signe of an invisible Grace. But in this Sacrament the
Body and Blood of Christ, properly taken, are nothing lesse than Visible, by your owne Confessions, who teach them to bee so Invisible herein, that they cannot bee discerned either by Angel, or the Bodily eyes of Christ himselfe. You perceive by this, that your Boast of this Place of Cyprian, is but a vaine blast. Wherefore wee expound the words thus; Christ's Body and Blood (that is) the outward Symbols, carrying the names of his Body and Blood, are Sacraments, and Seales of that Ve∣rity of the same Body, which was crucifyed, and of the same Blood, which was shed upon the Crosse for man's Redemp∣tion; and are here Sacramentally exhibited to the soules of the Faithfull. But you will aske, who will warrant this our Exposition of the words of Cyprian? and wee Answer, that wee shall need no other Interpreter than Cyprian himselfe, already alleged, saying,See before at num. 6. in the Mor∣gin. that Things signifying are called by the names of Things signifyed. So he there; and therefore so here are Bread and Wine called the Body and Blood of Christ, being in themselves onely Sacraments and Signes: whereof you have had example in his Saying, that Christ herein created his Body; by Body meaning Bread, as your Cardinall hath con∣fessed. Which may give you a true Patterne of the genuine Idiome of the Fathers, as often as they call the Bread Christ's Body, or Wine his Blood: and that all such Speeches are not more yours in sound, than they are ours in true and Ortho∣dox Sense. The second Vnconscionablenesse of Romish Disputers, for abuse of the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, is seene in objecting their de∣niall of Common and Bare Bread, in this Sacra∣ment; for an Argument of Tran∣substantiation. SECT. III. TO this purpose Irenaeus, saying thatIrenaeus lib. 4. contra. Haer cap. 34. Non est Panis Com∣munis. Bellar. Ob∣ijcit lib. 2. de Euch. per totum. It is not Common Bread: Ergo (say you) not to be properly judged by Sense. Vnconscionably; knowing thatSol. Chrysost. in Psal. 22. hom. 16. De aqua Baptismi. Non est aqua Com¦munis. Chrysostome (and also other Fathers, whom you moreover object) saith likewise of the Sa∣crament of Baptisme,See in this Se∣ction li. (c. h.) Wee are to behold it not as common water. The second is Iustine Martyr, saying,Bellamin. Ob∣lustin. Mart. lib 2.  , &c. Sol. Ratio, quia , id est, Euchari∣sticatus, sivè sanctificatus Cibus. Wee receive these, not as Common Bread, or Common Drinke. Therefore (say you) we may not judge them by Sense. Vnconscionably; knowing that Iustine Martyr in the same place sheweth his Reason, why it is
not to be called Common, even because (saith he) it is [] that is, Sanctified meat. And so Water in Baptisme is Sanctifi∣ed, as you know. The third is Cyrill of Ierusalem, saying,Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 13. Ob. Cyril. Hieros. Catech. 18.  Sol. Iem. Ca∣tech. 3. . Con∣sider these, not as Common Bread and Wine: Ergo (say you) not to bee judged by Sense. Vconscionably; knowing that the same Cyrill, in the same place, saith the same of the water of Baptisme: It is not simple Water. Yea, but hee further saith (sayOh. Cyrill. my∣stag. 3. . you) Thinke not of it, as of bare Bread, (adding) but the Bo∣dy of Christ. Ergo (say you) not to bee judged otherwise by Sense. Vnconscionably; knowing that the same Father in the same place, for explanation sake, saith likewise ofot Sequiturs . Idem Catech. My∣stag 3 Sacred Oyle, viz. Even so that holy Oyle is not bare and simple Oyle (Ad∣ding) but the gift of Grace. And that your Authours Vnconscionablenesse may bee the more notorious, in their Wresting of the Catholike meaning of the Fathers, in this kind, wee must tell you that there is no speech more familiar unto ancient Fathers than to esteeme, as they ought, all Sacramentall Signes Sacred; and therefore no more Common, or bare Elements. Inso much that Gregory Nyssen, speaking of a Ceremony inferior to this Sacrament, which is the Altar, or Table of the Lord, hee saith thatGreg. Nysson. Altare hoc sanctum, cui adsistimus, lpis est naturâ Commu∣nis, nihil differen ab alijs crustis lapides, ex quibus pavimenta nostra exornantur: Sed quoniam Dei cultui consecratur, & ddicatur, & benedi∣ctionem accept, mē∣sa facta, & Altare immaculatum est. O∣rat. de Sancto Baptis∣mo. Et nè contemnas divinum Lavacrum, neque id Commune putes, &c. Although by nature it bee but as other stone, wherewith the Pavements are garnished, and adorned; yet being Consecrated to Gods Service, by Benediction, it is an holy Table and Altar. Adding also of Baptisme, and saying; The Divine Water is not to bee contemned, nor to bee held as Com∣mon. Yea, and what lesse doth your Church say of your hal∣lowed Balsome, Beads, and Bells, and the like, all which you di∣stinguish from Common and bare Oyles, and Metals, because of their different use, and service, without Opinion of any Change of Substance at all? The third Vnconscionablenes of your Disputers in urging, for proofe of Transubstantiation, the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, forbidding men to [Discerne of this Sacra∣ment by their Senses.] And first of their abusing the Testimony of Cyril, by two egregious Falsifications. SECT. IV. VVEe may not easily passe over your Objection taken out of Cyrill, being in the opinion of your Cardinall so im∣pregnable; Let us first here your Objector:Cyrilli Testi∣monium vel solum sufficere deberet, est enim hujus Sancti, & antiquissimi, & ex opere ejus indubitto, & clarissiu & apertissimum, ut nullo modo perverti possit; & est in Catechesi, in quâ solent omnia propriè & simplicer explicari, & deniquè nemo unquam reprehendit Cyrillum erroris alicujas circa Eucharistiam. Bllr. lib 2. de Euch. cap. 13. This Testimony of Cyrill alone ought to suffice, being the Sentence of an holy man,
and most ancient, out of a worke which (unquestionably) was his, yea and most cleare, and plaine, as that it cannot be perverted. Be∣sides it is in his Catechisme, wherein the use of all things is delive∣red simply, properly, and plainly: Nor was this Father Cyrill ever reproved of Error in his doctrine of the Eucharist. Thus farre your Cardinall, you see, with as accurate an Oratory of Amplifi∣cation, as could bee invented. What Protestant would not now, if ever, expect a deadly blow from this Father to our Catholike Cause? but attend to the Issue. First,Cyril. Pro cer∣tissimo habeas, Pa∣nem hunc, qui vide∣tur à nobis, Panem non esse, etiamsi gu∣stus Panem esse sen∣serit, sed esse Corpus Christi—Rursus. Christus, cui creda∣mus, Panem in Cor∣pus Transmutavit—Nam sub specie Pa∣nis datur tibi corpus: sub specie Vini datur tibi sanguis. Catech. Mystag. 4. Cyril will not allow a man to credit his Taste, but although Taste saith it is Bread, yet undoubtedly to beleeve it to be the Body of Christ, whereinto the bread is changed. And he is brought in by yourCyrillus aper∣tè ponit Transmuta∣tionem Panis in cor¦pus Christi, & solas species Panis rema∣nere post Transmu¦tationem: quià dicit Corpus Domini sub specie Panis sum, distinguens Corpus à Pane. Bellar lib. 2 de Euch cap. 13. ad∣ding; Hoc est Aper∣tissimum Argumen∣tum. Cardinall to averre furthermore that The Body of Christ is given under the forme of Bread. And so the Sentence seemeth to bee most manifest, saith he. But for what wee pray you? That first (forsooth) the Change is the same with Transubstantiation: and secondly that there is no more Substance of Bread, but Accidents under the forme of Bread. So he, and MasterLiturg. Tra∣ctat. 2. §. 2. Subd 4. pag. 116. Brerely from him, as followeth; Cyril saith, under the forme of Bread his Body is given, &c. and then dan∣cing in the same triumph, addeth; Can any Catholike of this Age write more plainely? So he. And we answer, could any Iugglers deale more falsely? For upon due examination it will appeare to be a manifest Delusion, by a false Translation of Cyrils words. The Body of Christ is given (as your Cardinall doth render it) [sub specie Panis] in, or under the forme of Bread; whereas it is in the Greeke,Cyril.  Cate Mystag. 4. Russus Mystag. 5. Non ex∣istimetis vos gustare Panem & Vinum,  Vnder the Type of Bread: even as he saith after∣wards; Thinke not that you taste bread, but the Antitype of Christ's Body. In both, [, or ,] not, [] Type, and Antitype; not Forme, or Figure of Bread. Now there is a maine and manifest difference betweene Forme, and Type. For Accidentall Formes are things Reall, and the determinate Objects of Sense; but Types, or Antitypes are onely Relatives, and (as such) no Objects of Sense, but of Rea∣son, and understanding onely. As for example, when a Iudge is set in his Scarlet upon the Bench, the Eye seeth nothing but the colour, and the fashion of the Gowne, and outward fi∣gurature of his Face, and so may every Child see him; for these are Outward and Visible Accidents. But to see that man, as he hath upon him the person of a Iudge, ordained to trie Cau∣ses betweene Parties, is a sight of the minde, which looketh upon his Office, to discerne him by his Habit from common Subjects. Even so is it in this Sacrament; As the Bread and Wine are Round, and White, and Sweet in Taste, our Bodily Senses perceive them; but as they are Types, and Antitypes, that is, Signes of the Body and Blood of Christ, so are they spiritually discerned with our understanding onely.
As therefore it followeth not, that the Scarlet Gowne of the Iudge, because it is an Ensigne of his Office, should be onely Colour and Fashion, without the matter and Substance of the Cloth; no more can any conclude from Cyril, that because the Sacrament is a Type, therefore this Type was onely Forme, and outward Accidents, without all Substance of Bread. And thus your Cardinall his first [Apertissimum Argumentum] for proofe of Accidents, without the Substance of Bread in this Sa∣crament, is proved to be Apertissimum Figmentum, void of all substance, or almost shadow of Truth. His next Observation is the Change by Transubstantiation, and the errour of Sense, in judging it to be Bread. Wee call upon Cyril to decide this Controversie, who is best able to interpret himselfe. Hee therefore that said of the Eucharist, after Con∣secration, It is not Bare Bread, but the Body of Christ, affirmed as much of Consecrated Oyle, saying, It is not Bare Oyle. But we are answered, thatBellar. Hoc confirmat sententi∣m nostram. Nam Cyrillus non eodem modo loquitur de Chrismate, & de Eu∣charistia. De hac e∣nim ait, Non esse Panem Communem, sed Corpus Christi: de Chrismate vero dicitur quidem, non esse Commune Vn∣guentum, sed non addit Spiritum san∣ctum, vel Corpus Christi: sed esse Chrisma Christi san∣ctificatum oleum. l. 2. de Euch. cap. 13. Cyril, in denying the Eucharist to be Com∣mon Bread, called it after Consecration Christ's Body: but in denying Oyle to be Bare Oyle, hee called it yet still but Chrisme, (that is) Sanctified Oyle, after Consecration. So your Cardinall. And so are wee posed for ever. But behold another Iesuiticall Fraud! For Cyril as hee called the Consecrated Bread Christ's Body, after Consecration, so doth hee call the Consecrated Oyle [Charisma] that is, the Gift of the Grace of Christ; and not [Chrisma] that is, Chrisme, or Oyntment, as your Cardinall ren∣dreth it. Wee say againe hee calleth that Charisma, which notwith∣standing hee saith was, after Consecration, still Oyle, where∣with their Foreheads were anointed. This must we Iudge to have beene a notable Falsification of Bellarmine, except you would rather we should thinke, that when hee was now to prove that our Senses are deceived, in judging of Bread to bee Bread, hee meant to prove it by seeming to be deceived himselfe, in thus mistaking the word Chrisma, for Cyril. Ca∣tech. Mystag. 3. and so utter∣ly perverting the Iudgement of Cyril; by whom we are contra∣rily taught, that the Sight is no more deceived in judging Bread to be Bread, than in discerning Oyle to be Oyle. For neither was the other Bare Oyle, being a Type of a spirituall Gift; nor yet was it therefore changed into the Spirituall Grace it selfe, because it is so called; but onely is a Type and Symbol thereof. Which One Parallel of Oyle with Bread doth discover the Vnconsci∣onable pertinacie and Perversnesse of your Disputers, in ur∣ging the Testimony of Cyril. {fleur-de-lys}All this, which I have avouched out of Cyril, I have since found exactly confirmed by our IudiciousNot. M. S. in Bellar. formerly alle∣ged. Isaac Ca∣saubon, the Myrrour of learning; concluding with this Epipho∣nema: If I (saith he) have any judgment, Cyril judged Bread to
remaine in this Sacrament of the Eucharist, as verily as in Oyle consecrated, there remaineth Oyle. As for the terme of Trans∣mutation of Bread into Christ's Body, you may have a further plentifull satisfaction in the Seaventh Section following. And wee concurre in Iudgment with the same Cyril, exacting that wee regard not our Senses herein; namely, to looke upon it with our naturall eyes, as beholding bare Bread: but with Spirituall, to behold it to be Sacramentall Bread, and in it, as in a Signe, to discerne the Lords Body, as Cyril hath already expounded himselfe saying, that it is changed into an Anti∣type of Christ's Body.{fleur-de-lys} The like Romish Objection out of Chrysostome, and as Vnconscionable. SECT. V. SAint Chrysostome his Testimonie may in no wise be omitted, which seemeth to your Disputers to bee so Convincent, that yourBellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 22. Cardinall placed it in the front of his host of the Fathers, whom hee produceth, as able to breake through an Army of Adversaries alone; and MasterMr. Brerelay, Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 4. Subd. 2. pag. 167. Brerely reserved it to the last of the Testimonies, which he alleged, as that which might serve for an Vpshot. I will conclude (saith hee) admonishing the Christian Reader with Saint Chrysostome his Saying (you long to heare it, wee thinke:) Although Christ his speech (saithChrysost in Matth. Hom. 8. Eti∣amsi sensui, & co∣gitationi nostrae ab∣surdum esse videatur quod dicit, superat{que} sensum nostrum & rationem sermo ip∣sius, quaeso, quod in omnibus rebus, sed praecipuè in mysterijs faciamus? non illa quae ante nos jacent aspicientes, sed ver∣ba tenentes? nam verbis ejus defrau dari non possumus, sed sensus saepiùs fal∣litur. Quoniam igi∣tur ille dixit [Hoc est Corpus meum] nul∣la dubitatione tene∣amus, sed credamus, nihil enim sensibile traditur à Christo nobis, sed in rebus sensibilibus. Omnia verò, quae tradidit, sunt insensibilia; si∣cut in Baptismo per Aquam donum illud conceditur—Rege∣neratio intelligitur, quia est: nam si in∣corporeus esses, in∣corporea tibi tradi∣disset dona; quoni∣am verò Anima con∣juncta est Corpori, in sensibilibus intelligibilia tibi tradidit. Chr∣sostome) may seeme absurd unto Sense and Reason, I exhort you notwithstanding that, especially in Mysteries, we looke not unto that which is before us, but observe Christ's words: for we cannot bee disappointed of that which hee saith, but Senses may be deceived. Wherefore, because he said [This is my Body] we are altogether to beleeve it, for hee delivereth no sensible things unto us; but all which hee delivereth in things sensible are insensible: e∣ven as in Baptisme the gift of Regeneration granted us is Intel∣ligible. For if thou wert without a Body, then things onely unbo∣dily should be given unto thee, but now because thy Soule is joy∣ned with a Body, therefore in things sensible hath Christ delive∣red unto thee things intelligible. So Chrysostome. Now what of all this? Chrysostome (saith yourBellar. Non potuisset sanè Chrysostomus loqui clariùs, si Calvinistam aliquem habuisset, quem hortari ad fidem voluisset. Ibid. quo supra. Cardinall) could not speake more plainely, if hee had had some Calvi∣nist before him, whom hee meant to exhort to the Faith. So hee, meaning the Faith of Transubstantiation, Which (as hath been confessed) was no doctrine of Faith untill more than a Thousand yeeres after Christ. But to returne to Chrysostome, whose Sen∣tence
wee may compare to a Nut, consisting of a Shell, and a Kernel: The Shell wee may call his Figurative Phrases; the Kernel wee may terme his Orthodoxe meaning. Of both in the Section following. Of the Rhetoricall, and Hyperbolicall Phrases of Chrysostome. SECT. VI. TO begin with the Shell. First, wee are to know that Hyper∣bole is a Rhetoricall Trope, or Figure, which may be defi∣ned to be an Excessive speech, signifying a Truth in an Vntruth. As to say, Something is more darke than darknesse it selfe; which, being strictly taken, were an Impossibility, and Vntrue: but it doth imply this Truth, (namely) that the thing is wonder∣fully, and extremely darke. Secondly, that Chrysostome was most frequent in this Fi∣gure Hyperbole, your owneNon sunt Con∣cionatorum verba in rigore accipienda, quùm primùm ad au∣tes perveniant, mul∣ta enim per Hyper∣bolen Declamatores enunciant: hoc in∣terdum Chrysosto∣mo contingit. Senen∣sis Bibliotheca. An∣not. 152. Senensis doth instruct you; where giving a generall Caution, that Fathers in their Sermons do use to declame Hyperbolically, he doth instance most specially, and by name, in Chrysostome. {fleur-de-lys} And albeit that Wee object plaine places of Chrysostome, and such wherein every word may be taken in a proper Sense; (as for Example, where hee reproveth those that are onely Gazers, and not Communi∣cants at the Celebration of the Eucharist, It is better (saith hee) not to be present, than not to participate) yet can wee re∣ceive no better Answer, or other satisfaction from your Cardinall than thus;Quod dicit Chrysostomus, meli∣us esse non interesse Sacrificio, quàm in∣teresse, & non com∣munica: Dco Chry∣sostomum, ut quae∣dam alia, per exces∣sum esse locuum. Bellar. lib. 2. de Mis∣sa. Cap. 10. §. Ad illud. Chrysostome here, as else where, spake in an excesse.{fleur-de-lys} Thirdly, that the Excessive Phrases of Chrysostome, upon this Sacrament, do verifie as much, viz. to tell his people, that Dentes Carnl suae insigere. Chrys. Homil. 45. in Iohan. Lingua cruentatur hoc admirabili Sen∣guine. Hom. 83. in Matth. Turbam cir∣cumsusam rubificri. Lib 3. de Sacerdotio. Their Teeth are fixed in the flesh of Christ: that, Their tongues are bloodied with his Blood: and that The Assembly of the people are made red therewith. Fourthly, that hee is as Hyperbolicall in denying (in the Cele∣bration of this Sacrament) the judgement of Senses, saying, Num vides Pa∣nem? num Vinum? nè putetis Corpus ac∣cipere ab homine, sed ex ipso Seraphin forcipe ignem, Idem. Tom. 3 de Eucharist. in Encaenijs. Do wee see Bread or Wine? which is spoken in as great an exuberancie of speech, as are the next words immediately fol∣lowing, saying: Thinke not that you receive the Body from a man, but Fire from a Scraphin, or Angel, with a paire of Tongs. You will thinke (notwithstanding those kinde of Phrases) that Chrysostome thought he saw aswell Bread and Wine in this Sacra∣ment, as he could discerne either Man from a Seraphin, or Spi∣rit; or his owne Fingers from a paire of Tongs. Fiftly, that the Sentence objected against us, is adorned with
the same figure Hyperbole, when he saith that No sensible thing is delivered unto us in this Sacrament, and that our senses herein may be deceived. Words sore pressed by you, yet twice uncon∣scionably; both because every Sacrament by your owne Church is defined to beSacramentum est invisibilis gratae signum visibile. Ma∣gister Sentent. lib 4. dist. 1. Sacramentum est es sensibus ob∣jecta. Catech. Trid. Teste Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram cap 11. A Sensible Signe; and also for that you your selves confesse thatSensus non fal∣litur cà proprium objectum Sententia vera. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 24. Our senses cannot be deceived in their pro∣per sensible Objects. Sixtly, that Chrysostome himselfe well knew he did Hyperbo∣lize herein, who after that hee had sayd, No sensible thing is de∣livered unto us in this Sacrament; notwithstanding, hee addeth immediately, saying of this Sacrament, that In things Sensible, things Intelligible are given unto us. Thus farre of the Rheto∣rike of Chrysostome. Now are wee to shew his Theologie, and Catholike meaning, as it were the Kernel of his Speech. Hee in the same Sentence will have us understand Man to consist of Body and Soule, and accordingly in this Sacrament Sensible things are ministred to the Body, as Symbols of spirituall things, which are for the Soule to feed upon. So that a Christian, in receiving this Sacrament, is not wholly to exercise his minde upon the bodily Object, as if that were onely, or principally the thing offered unto us; No, for then indeed our Senses would deceive our Soules of their spirituall Benefit. As for Transubstantiation, and Absence of Bread, Chrysostome, in true Sense, maketh wholly against it, by explaining himselfe, and paralleling this Sacrament with Baptisme: As in Baptisme (saithSicut in Baptis∣mo, &c. Chrysost. See above, §. 5. at (r.) he) Regeneration, the thing intelligible, is given by water, the thing sensible, the Substance of water remaining. Which proportion between the Eucharist and Baptisme, is held commonly by ancientSee hereafter at large in the 8. Book. Fathers, to the utter overthrow of Transubstantiation. And that Chrysostome belie∣ved the Existence of Bread after Consecration,See above Chap 3. §. 13. hath beene al∣ready expressely showne, and is here now further proved. For he saith of Bread after Consecration, thatNos per hunc Panem unione con∣jugimur Chrysost. in 1. Cor. Hom. 24. Wee are joyned to∣gether one with another, by this Bread. {fleur-de-lys} And yet further∣more, the same Chrysostome hath already delivered his mind, touching the infallibility of the sense of Touching; decla∣ring in a plaine and literall Sense, as from the mouth of Christ, * That man's sense of Touch could not be deceived. {fleur-de-lys} And now that you see the Nut cracked, you may observe how your Disputers have swallowed the Shell of Hyperbolicall Phrases, and left the kernel of Theologicall Sense for us to con∣tent our selves withall. Furthermore (for this is not to be omit∣ted) the other Testimony of Chrysostome is spun and woven with the same Art, which saith of Consecrating this Sacra∣ment, thatChrysost. Hom 50 in Matth. juxta Edit. Graec. Nè exi∣stmes Sacerdotem esse. qui hoc facit, sed [] Then follow∣eth of Baptisme, Ibid. Ille non te Baptizat. . Man is not to thinke it is the hand of the Priest, but of Christ himselfe, that reacheth it unto him; seeing imme∣diately after (as it were with the same breath) it is added: It is
not the Minister, but God that Baptizeth thee, and holdeth thy head. {fleur-de-lys} Words, you see, as Hyperbolicall as could be utte∣red, and notwithstanding urged by your Doctor Heskins, calling it aDr. Heskins in his partiam of Christ, Book. 2. Chapt. 55. objecteth. Plaine place, for proof of a proper Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament. But will this rellish with you also? All this is to prove unto you, that you are not to exact an , no more than when the Apostle said of the faithfull, in respect of Christ;See above c. 3. §. 7. Thus farre concer∣ning the Iudgement of Senses, which hath beene formerly pro∣ved (at large) both byIbid. in the Chapters following. Scriptures, and * Fathers. Wee draw neerer our marke, which is the word Transubstantiation it selfe. Fourthly, the Vnconscionablenesse of your Disputers, in urging other Figurative Sayings, and Phrases of the Fathers, of Bread Changed, Transmuted, &c. into the Body of Christ, for proofe of a Transubstantiation thereof in a Proper Sense. SECT VII. SVch words as these, Bread is the Body of Christ; It is made the Body of Christ; It is Changed, Translated, Trans-muted, Trans-elementated into the Body of Christ, are Phrases of the highest Emphasis that you can finde in the Volumes of Anti∣ty; which if they were literally meant, according to your Ro∣mish Sense, there ought to be no further Dispute. But if it may evidently appeare, by the Idiome of speech of the same Fa∣thers, that such their Sayings are Tropicall, and sometimes Hyperbolicall, then shall wee have just Cause to taxe your Dis∣puters of as great Vnconscionablenesse (if not of more) in this, as in any other. For whensoever they finde in any Father (as inEusebias Emiss. Adest Substantia Pa∣nis, sed post verba Christi est Corpus Christi. Hom. 5. Ob∣jected by Mr. Brerely. Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd. 2. {fleur-de-lys} And Damasc. lib. 4. de Orthod. side, cap. 14. Panem corpus suum facere. Objected by Dr. Heskins in his Parliament. Booke 2. Chap. 20. {fleur-de-lys} Eusebius) these words; The Bread is the Body of Christ; they object it for Transubstantiation; but Vnconscionably. First, seeing that the Fathers do but herein imitate our Lord and Master Christ, who said of the Bread [This is my Body:] which hath beene See above B. 2. throughout. proved by Scriptures, and Fathers to be a Figurative and unproper speech. Secondly, seeing that they use the same Dialect in other things, as Cyril of Sacred Oyle, saying, this is Charisma, the Gift of Grace; as hee called also the Holy Kisse a Cyrill. sup. Reconciliation, and Others the like, as you have heard. Thirdly, seeing that you your selves have renounced all proper Sense of all such speeches, because Things of different na∣tures cannot possibly be affirmed one of another: for no more can it be properly said, Bread is man's Body, than wee can say, An
Egge is a Stone, as you haveSee above, Booke 2. cap. 1. §. 4. confessed. Againe, Some Fathers say, Bread is made Flesh, as SaintAmbros. De Pane; Fit Corpus caro Christi. Ob by Bellarmine, lib. 2. de Euchar cap. 14. and by others. Ambrose objected; but Vn∣conscionably; knowing, First, that you your selves are brought now at length to deny the Body of Christ to be Produced out of Bread. Secondly, knowing the like Idiome of Fathers in their other Speeches; Chrysostome saying thatChrysost Nos secum Christus mu∣nam, ut ità dicam, massam reducit, ne{que} id fide tantùm, sed reipsâ nos Corpus suum effecit. In Matt 26. hom. 83. Objec by Mr. Brerely. Li∣turg. Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd. 2. Christ hath made us his owne Body, not onely in Faith, but in Deed also. And Augustine saying thatAug. Ipsi Christiani cum Ca∣pite suo, quod ascen∣dit in coeum, unus est Christus. Enarrat. in Psal. 127. Et in Psal. 26. Titulus Psalmi: Omnes  illo, & Christi, & Christus sumus Christians themselves with their Head, which ascended into heaven, are one Christ: yea, and PopeLeo, De homine Regenerato per Bap∣tismum. Vt susceptu, à Christo, & suscipi¦ens Christum, non idem sit post Lava∣crum, quod ante Bap∣tismum fuit, sed ut corpus Regenerati fiat caro Crucifixi. Serm. de passione. 14. Leo, saying of the party Baptized, that Hee is not the same that hee was before Baptisme, by which (saith he) the Body of the party Regenerate is made the Flesh of Christ crucified. Yea, and our Venerable Bede saith,Beda in 1. Cor 10. Num & nos ip∣sius Corpus facti su∣mus, & quod accipi∣mus, nos sumus. Wee are made that Body which we receive. In all which the word [Made,] you know, is farre from that high straine of Transubstantiation. Wee draw yet neerer to the Scope. Wee may not deny, but that the Fathers sometimes extend their voyces higher, unto the Preposition Trans; asSee above, c. 4. §. 7. Tran∣sit, Transmutatur, signifying a Change, and Trans-mutation in∣to the Body of Christ. Every such Instance is, in the opinion of your Doctors, a full demonstration of Transubstantiation it selfe; and all the wits of men cannot (saith one) Assoyle such Objections. Wherein they shew themselves altogether Vnconscionable, as hath beene partly declared in Answering your Objected Say∣ings ofSee above c. 4. §. 2. Ambrose, In aliud Convertuntur; ofIbid. at the Letter (r) Cyprian his Panis naturà mutatus; of Cyrils Trans-mutavit; and as now in this Section is to be manifested, in answering your other Objections to the full. The FatherGregor. Nyssen. Quicquid assuenu conveniens est, & ex∣pertrum sit, ut Apo∣stolus vult, qui han mensam nobis pa∣pavit, in id com∣mutatur, infirmor∣bus olus, Infantibus Lac, &c. Lib. de vita Mosis pag. 509. Gregory Nyssen, comparing the Body of Christ with Manna, which satisfied every man's Taste that received it, saith that The Body of Christ in this Sacrament is changed into whatsoever seemeth to the Receivers appetite convenient and desired. This is objected by your Cardinall, to prove Tran∣substantiation: but, First, Vnconscionably; because it is in it selfe (being literally understood,) even in your owne judge∣ments, incredible. For what Christian will say that the Bo∣dy of Christ is Transubstantiated into any other thing? much lesse into whatsoever thing the appetite of the Receiver shall de∣sire? No. But as Manna did satisfie the bodily Appetite: so, Christ's Body to the Faithfull is food, satisfying the Soule in the Spirituall and heavenly desire thereof. Wee say, the Soule, and not the bodily appetite, as your selves well know, and the Councell ofcertne Councell of Ni L. 4. c. 11. §. 3. Nice doth teach us to professe. Se∣condly, Vnconscionably objected, because the same Father expresseth his Hyperbolicall maner of Speech likewise, saying thatGreg. Niss. Corpus illud Christi in Corpus nostrum ingrediens totu nin se transfert. Ob. by Bellar. l. 2. c. 10. §. Idem Greg. Christ's Body doth change our bodies into it selfe, which
in the Literall Sense, according to your arguing, would prove a Transubstantiation of Mens Bodies into Christ. {fleur-de-lys} Were it (for these are his two Instances) into Milke, or Colewoorts. But what now?Bellar lib. 2. de Euch. ca. 6. Idem Gregorius in Orati∣one Catechetica cap. 37. multa habet ex∣pressè de veritate hu∣jus hic locus ab Eu∣thymio. Dicit corpus Christi immortale cum nostro corpore mortali conjungi, & immortale per illud reddi: & quod in corpus nostrum in∣grediens terum in se transfert & commu∣tat—Deinde se explicat—Dicit hoc fieri divinâ vir∣tute, & explicat se∣ipsum, dicit enim, nunc Panem mutart in Carnem Christi, quemadmodum, dum adhuc in terris esset, mutabatur Panis, quo ipse vescebatur, in Carnem ipsius. Quae am sunt perspicua, ut non fuerit ausus ullus Adversariorum, quòd sciam, vel ad haec oca respondere, vel aliquid ex hoc au∣thore nobis objicere. The same Gregory Nyssen (saith your Cardinall) in his Catechetica hat such plaine places for the changing of Bread into the substance of Christ's Flesh, as which none of our Adversaries, for ought that I know, did ever answer, or yet object out of this Author, any thing a∣gainst us. So hee. And good reason, for indeed, none need to busie himselfe with answering to these places, except you could prove that these were the words of the same Gr. Nys∣sen, and not of some other suborned Author, under his name. Whereof wee may bee perswaded both because that the objected places are onely read in theBellarm. de Script Eccles. d An∣num 380. Tit. Greg. Nyssen.—Obser∣vatio secunda, praeter libros numeratos, ex∣nt ex Editione Pa∣siensi, Anno 1573. Catechetica oratio, &c. after-Editions of the works of Gregory Nyssen, and also for that (as your own Author, who hath published the same Catecheticall Oration, confesseth ofAuthor prae∣fat. ad Elit. Paris. Anno 1573. Quae de Transubstantiatione in Cap. 37. & 38. habentur, in exem∣plaribus Manuscriptis multis non haberi. [To that of the Bo∣dies of the Receivers to be made immortall, See an Answer, Book 5. Chap. 8. §. 3. Your Objection of Divine Power is Answered already, in this Chapter, Sect. 2. To that hee Questioneth, how Christ's Body, being but one, can hee, without Diminution, received of so many? it is Answered in the 4. Booke. The places concerning the Eucharist, which are the same now objected) They are wanting in divers Manuscripts of Gregory Nyssen his workes. And how much more suspicious may this seeme to them, who are acquain∣ted with your Booke-mints, and Booke-manglers, as well in foysting in false Sentences, as in falsifying the true? This might have beene our first Answer; but lest that, if wee should insist upon this, wee might seeme to decline your pretended answerlesse Objection, observe you, with us, in the same Author, that as he sayeth, The Bread is con∣verted into the Body of Christ, so hee saith of the same Bo∣dy of Christ, being received, thatSee above at (p.) It doth convert the bo∣dy of the Receiver into Christ himselfe, as you have heard. Whereby he teacheth both you and us, that this word, Convert, is to bee taken for a mysticall and Sacramentall Change, and not for a proper and substantiall; except you would conclude from the same Father, by you objected, that the body of the Communicant is Transubstantiated into Christ himselfe. Nor this onely, but by vertue of the same word [Transit,] must you bee constrained to allow of a farre more strange Transubstantiation, even of the Bread, which was eaten of Christ,Nyssen. in Orat. Catech. qo su∣pra. Corpus Dei verti ad divinam Dignitatem, .—& in illo Corpore (sc. Christi.) transmutants Panis transit in divinam naturam. Into his owne Deitie. Are you not ashamed to urge such a proper Sense of the same words of Nyssen in one Sentence, which in another Sen∣tence of his, (if properly taken) you your selves cannot but abhorre as Hereticall.
And with the same forehead doth your Cardinall say, that Protestants finde nothing to object out of this Father, Gregory Nyssen; seeing that it is not Nothing to observe, where Nyssen saith, thatBellar. lib. 2. de Eucharist. cap. 16. Gregor. Nyssen. de vita Mosis. Panis, qui de Coelo descen∣dit, qui verus cibus est, qui aenigmaticè hac Historiâ (de Manna) significatur, non incorporea res est, quo enim pacto res incorporea cor∣pori cibus fiet? res autem quae in corpo∣re est, corpus omni∣nò non est. The Bread, which descended from Heaven, is the true meate signified in the History (of Manna) it is no incorporeall thing, and being without a Body, cannot be nourishment to a Body. Hereupon we make bold to demand of your Answerer, what is that in this Sacrament, which givethSee above, Chap. 3. Sect. 10. nourishment to all, whether Men, or Mice, that receive it? And the Oracle of your Schooles telleth us, that not Bread and Wine, but theAqam part. 3 Qu. 77 Art. 6. Spe¦cies Sacramētales—manifestum est quòd nutriunt. Accidents and Formes of Bread and Wine do nourish. Contrarily, Gregory Nyssen saith, as you have heard; [] How can an incorporeall thing give nourishment to a thing corporall? (as thinking it im∣possible.) Our Argument then from thence may be this. See∣ing Accidents of Bread cannot nourish, then certainely the substance of Bread, in this Sacrament, which giveth a bodily nourishment, doth remaine therein. And if the Substance of Bread remaine, then (by your owne unanimous Confessions) Bread is not changed, and converted into the Substance of Christ's Body; and consequently must you bidd your Lateran Dame Transubstantiation adiue. Chrysostome is found admiring these Mysteries, and is ob∣jected by Mr.Mr. Brerely, Tract. . § 4. Subd. 2. pag. 164. Brerely, for proofe of the wonderfull Effects of this Sacrament. Why? what saith he?Chrysost. Ad∣miranda Mysteria—ut non solùm per di∣lectionem, sed reipsa in illam carnem con∣vertamur. Hom. 45. in Iob. Wee our selves (saith hee) are converted and changed into the Flesh of Christ. Which was the former saying of Greg. Nyssen. Will your Disputers never learne the Hyperbolicall Language of ancient Fathers, especially when they speake of Sacramentall, and mysticall things? (more especially Chrysostome, who, when hee falleth upon this Subject, doth almost altogether Rhetori∣cat:) but chiefly when they cannot bee ignorant that such words of the Fathers, in the Literall straine, are utterly absurd. For what greater Absurdity than (as is now objected) for our Bodies to be Transubstantiated into the Body of Christ? Hearken unto Chrysostome a word more, and hee will tell you, that wicked and impenitent Communicants beingAnd againe, Hom. 51. in Matth. 14. Quam Satisfacti∣onem offeremus, si cùm nutriti hoc cibo, ipsi in lupos conver∣tamur? Nourished with this food, are turned into Woolves. Now are we past the limits of due Antiquity, you descend lower. Theophylact will say hard to us, who, speaking of this Sacra∣ment, saith indeed thatTheophylact. in Marc. 14. Vocat hanc Conversionem Trans-elementationem, quae quidem vox nihil minus significat quàm Transubstantiatio: nam Trans-elementatio significat mutationem totius rei—ad ipsam ma∣teriam, quae ab Aristotele Elementum dicitur. Si mutatio solius formae, rectè dicitur . Transformatio, & mutatio, externae figurae transfiguratio, cur mutatio substantiae non poterit rectè dici Transubstantiatio? Bellarmin. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 23. §. Secundo. The Bread is Trans-elementated into
the Body of Christ: which your Cardinall will have to bee, in the same Fathers sense, Equivalent with your Transubstantiation. Vnconscionably; for doth not the same Father say, likewise that Theoph. in. Ioh. 6 Qui me man lucat, quodammodò . A Christian is in a maner Trans-elementated into Christ? Like as Isidore Pelusiota spake ofIsior. Pelusiat. lib 3. Epistol 107. De recipiente semen, ut terra bon: Qui verbum recipit [. Trans elementing, in a sort, of the word of God into the good Iearer. Againe, Theophylact is objected, as saying,Theophyl. in. Math. 26. Panis in∣effbili modo trans∣formatur—Panis quidem apparet, sed caro est. Objected by Mr. Ererely, Laturg. Tract. 2 §. 2. Sbd. As for [est caro] this Phrase  beene al∣ready answered. See above at (s.) The Bread is after an ineffable maner Transformed. It is true; Hee saith so: and so doth Hie∣rome say thatHier. in Marc. 14. Accepit Iesus Panem, & bnedixit, fregi, Transfigurans Corpus suum in Pa∣nem: quod est Ec∣clesia praesens, quae frangitur in passioni∣bus. Christ, in breaking Bread, did Transfigure, or Transforme his Body into his Church broken with afflictions: and Pope Leo sticketh not to say thatLeo. Non alia igi∣tur participatio Cor∣pous, quàm ut mid, qud summus tran∣seamus. De Passione Serm. 24 Wee Christians, in com∣municating [Transimus] turne, or are Changed into Christ his Body. So these ancient Fathers. Are you not yet out of breath with objecting Testimonies of Fathers Vnconscionably, and imperinently? No, for Master Brerely, for a Close, desireth to be heard, and to try us with an Objection out of the Greeke Church these latter times, as followeth.Mr. Brereley in his Apologie (of the first Edition) con∣cerning the Faith of the ancient Greeke Church. It appeareth by a Treatise published by the Pro∣testant Divines at Wittenberge, Anno Domini 1584. intituled [Acta Theologorum Wittenbergensium, & Hieremiae Patriarchae Constantinop. &c.] that the Greeke Church at this day (although divided from the Latine) professeth to beleeve Transubstantiation. So he of the Patriarch Hieremas; which Patriarch, if he were alive, would very hardly containe himselfe from answering this your Brother with some indignation, calling him both rash and precipitant; seeing that the same Patriarch expresly said thatHier. Patriarch. Non enim hic no∣minus tantùm com∣municatio est, sed rei identitas: etenim ve∣rè Corpus & San∣guis Christi mysteria sunt: non quòd haec in corpus humanum transmutentur, sed nos in illa, melioribus praevalentibus. Which is his Answer in this Poynt to the Doctors of Witenbèrge. The Body and Blood of Christ are indeed Mysteries, which are not changed into humane flesh, but wee into them. So that Patriarch. {fleur-de-lys}Neverthelesse another bold RomishFranciscus de Sancta Clara. Exposit. Artic. Confess.

So he; namely so, as wee Protestants do likewise professe (as will be declared in the next Booke at
large.) And that the Grecians, who were present at the Coun∣cell of Florence, did not yield Assent to that Article of Tran∣substantiation, although your IesuiteGordon. Ies.

Master Brerely would thinke it an injury done unto himselfe, if we should pretermit his objected Authority of Pope Grego∣ry: for Doctor Humphrey (saith hee) doth charge Gregory the Great with Transubstantiation. So Master Brerely, who objected this in his Apologie, many yeares agoe, and had a full Answer in anAppeale. lib. 1. Chap. 2. §. 7. [The testimony it self, cited out of Greg. by M Brereley, is answered in the first Book, con∣cerning EATING. Appeale, made purposely in confutation of his whole Apo∣logie. The Summe of that Answer is this: Doctor Humphrey did not speake that, as grounded upon any sentence of Gregory, but onely upon the report of a Romish Legend (supposing it to be true) which in the udgement of Romish Doctors them∣selves (whose Testimonies are there cited) Is unworthy to report the memory of the fact, being in it selfe fond, filthy, and frivo∣lous, the Author whereof may seeme to have a face of Iron, and a heart of Lead; and the Objector, namely Master Brerely (for grounding his Objection on a Legendary History) A Falsisier of his owne promise. This Answer was home, one would thinke, and might justly have provoked him to satisfie for himself, if hee could have found any Errour therein: yet notwithstan∣ding, for want of better service, bringeth he in these Cole-worts twise sod. CHALLENGE. VVHat greater Vnconscionablenesse could your Dispu∣ters bewray, than by so torturing the Hyperbolicall, Fi∣gurative, and Sacramentall Sayings of Ancient Fathers for proofe of the Transubstantiation of Bread into the Body of Christ? insomuch that they must bee consequently constrained, by the force of some Phrases, contrary both to the meaning of the same Fathers, and to the Doctrine of your owne Romish Church, to admit of three other Transubstantiations; viz. First, of Christ his Body into whatsoever the Appetite of the Commu∣nicant shall desire. Secondly, of Christ his Body into the Body of every Christian. And Thirdly, of the Body of every Christi∣an into the Body of Christ. As the Testimonies obje∣cted plainly pronounce. {fleur-de-lys}Besides which you may adde a Fourth, of Bread into the Deity of Christ. And againe, a Fift out of Chrysostome, of the Wicked receivers, turned into Wolves, as you have heard. As also (for a Sixt, from others, of the Change ofSet the 9 §. following, Dioysius.

Fiftly, the like Vnconscionablenesse of your Romish Disputers is un∣masked, by laying open the Emphaticall Speeches of the Fa∣thers, concerning Baptisme, answerable to their Sayings objected, for proofe of Transubstantiation in the Eucharist. SECT. VIII. COncerning Baptisme wee haveSee above in this Chap. §. 3. &c. heard already, out of the Writings of Antiquity, as efficacious Termes, as you could object for the Eucharist.

Fourthly, to thinke that It is not the Priest, but God that Baptizeth, who holdeth thy head. Lastly, Baptisme (saith the Councel ofBooke 8 Chàp. 2. §. 1. Conc. Nicen.

Touching the Exposition of Christ's words, [This is my Body.] The Fathers (saith he) used the same forme of speech, which Christ had done before them: which doth no whit helpe the Papists, because it is one thing to use the same phrase of speech, and another thing to de∣fine how they are to be expounded. They speake of a Transmu∣tation, and Change, but so expound themselves, that their words make plainly against the doctrine of the Church of Rome. II. Vsing Examples, which destroy Transubstantiation, (as namely) the Change of Water in Baptisme, of Laicks into the Priest. III. They acknowledged the sensible Signe with the thing signified thereby. But they never teach any thing whereby either Transubstantiation, or the being of Accidents
without their substance is established. IV. They attribu∣ted the Participation of this Mysterie unto Faith, yet so, as not excluding the receiving by the Mouth, in respect of the Sym∣bols. Somethinke, when the Fathers say Christ is present, And hee hath left us his Body, and the like, that thereby they meane the Doctrine of the Papists, but they are deceived. V. All the Fathers with one Consent teach, that there is the same Change and Transmutation of Water in Baptisme, which there is of Bread in the Eucharist. VI. That the Hy∣perboles and Excessive speeches of the Fathers are not to be pres∣sed, no more than that of Dionysius Areopagita, saying that Man, by this Sacrament, is made a God. Thus farre that Or∣thodoxe and learned Author, justifying (in effect) as much as hitherto by Vs hath beene avouched from Antiquity. Sixtly, the Vnconscionablenesse of the Romish Opposites doth betray it selfe, by their alleging of Testimonies of the Fathers, contrary to their owne Romish Principles. SECT. X. YOur Romish Positions and Principles are these; one is this:Iosephus An∣gles Flor. Theolog. qu. 5. Art. 1. Disp. 3 Conclu. 1. Panis fit corpus Christi, est falsa positio; quià non suscipit Corpus Christi formam panis. Conclu. 2.

Rich. Gabr. Sotus, Ledesma, hanc propositionem esse falsam, si secundùm proprietatem vocum accipiatur. Et ratio manifesta est, quià cum aliquid dicitur fieri aliud, debet esse aliquod commune, saltem materia sub utro{que} termino Transmutationis, hic autem nihil manet commune nisi Accidentia, quae non fiant corpus Christi, sed continent. AEgidius Coninck de Sacramentis. Qu. 75. Art. 8.

Christi, is False, say your Doctors; And, It cannot agree with the Body of Christ in true Proprietie; and they give reasons hereof (in the Margin.) The other is, That to affirme, that Bread is changed into Christ his Body, is a false Proposition: the reason is, because in your Transubstanciation there is no Change made in Christ's Body. A third may be this, touching the Praeposition, [Dè] That the Body of Christ cannot be pro∣perly said to be made [De Pane] of Bread; for so it should not be of the flesh of the Virgin. Thus can they say, and thus can they conclude; and yet notwithstanding, for defence of their Transubstantiation, thus durst they produce such Te∣stimonies of Fathers, wherein the Bread is said to be made Christ's Body; and which speake of Changing Bread into Christ's Body; and also such, which expresse the Body of Christ to be made of Bread. Which one Consideration as it doth discover the Vnconscionablenesse of our Adversaries, so may it instruct us, that all such Sentences of the Fathers are to be Interpreted as spoken, , or in a Figura∣tive Sense. CHALLENGE. ONely give us leave to speer you a Question, before wee end this third Booke. Seeing that Transubstantiation cannot properly be, by your owne Doctrine, except the Substance of Bread ceasing to be, there remaine only the Accidents thereof (this Position of the continuance of Onely Accidents, without a Subject, being your Positive Foundation of Transubstantiation) Why is it that none of all your Romish Disputers was hitherto ever able to produce any one Testimony out of all the Volumes of Antiquity, for proofe of this one point, excepting onely that of Cyril, whichSee above Chap. 4. § 4. hath bin (as yoe have heard) egregiously abused and falsified? Learne you to Answer this Question, or else shame to object Antiquity any more; but rather con∣fesse your Article of Transubstantiation to be but a Bastardly Impe. Wee might inlarge our selves in this point of your Vncons∣cionablenesse, in your objecting Testimonies of Fathers, for proofe aswell of Transubstantiation, as of the other Articles above-mentioned; but that they are to be presented in their proper places, to wit; in the following Treatises, concerning Corporall Presence; Corporall Vnion, Corporall Sacrifice of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, and the Divine Adoration thereof; so plainly that any man may be perswaded, our Opposites meane no good Faith, in arguing from the Iudgement of Ancient Fa∣thers. Hitherto of the First Romish Consequences.
THE FOVRTH BOOKE, Treating of the second Romish Consequence, arising from the false Exposition of these words of Christ, [THIS IS MY BODY,] called Corporall Pre∣sence in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. THE Sacramentall Presence hath a double Relation, one is in respect of the thing sensibly received, which is the Sacra∣ment it selfe; the other in respect of the Receiver and Communicant. Both which are to bee distinctly considered, as well for our right discerning of the matter in hand, as also for Method's sake. The first is handled in this Booke: the second in that which fol∣loweth. CHAP. I. Of the state of this point of Controversie. That notwithstanding the difference of opinion of Christ's Presence be onely De modo, that is, of the maner of Being; yet may the Romish Doctrine be Hereticall: and to hold the contrary is a pernitious Paradoxe. SECT. I. IT would be a wonder to us, to heare Any of our owne profession to be so extremely Indifferent, concerning the different opinions of the Maner of the Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament; as to thinke the Romish Sect therefore either Tollerable, or Reconciliable, upon Pretence that the Question is onely De modo, (that is) of the maner of Being,
and that Consequently all Controversie about this is but vaine langling. Such an one ought to enter into his second thoughts, to consider the necessity that lyeth upon every Christian to abandon divers Heresies, albeit their difference from the Or∣thodox profession were only De modo. As for example. First, The Gnostick taught man's soule to have it's beginning by ma∣ner of Production, from the substance of God. The Catholikes sayd nay; but by maner of Creation, of nothing. The Pela∣gians maintained a free will in spirituall Acts, from the grace of Nature. The Catholikes nay; but by speciall grace of Christ, freeing the will through the efficacious operation of his holy Spirit. The Catharists held themselves pure, in a purity of an absolute perfection. The Catholikes nay; but by an Inchoative, comparative, and imperfect perfection of purity. Furthermore against our Christian Faith, of beleeving God to be absolutely a Spirit; the Anthropomorphites conceived of God, as of one (after the maner of men) consisting of Armes and Leggs, &c. Not to be tedious. Wee come to the Sacraments. The Ca∣taphrygae did not Baptize in the name of the Blessed Trinity, af∣ter the maner of the Catholikes. The Artotyritae celebrated the Eucharist in Bread and Cheese. To omit many others, take one ponyard, which wee are sure will pierce into the intrailes of the Cause (to wit) the heresie of the Capernaits, in the dayes of our Saviour Christ: who hearing his Sermon, teaching men to Eate his flesh; and conceiving thereby a carnall maner of Eating, irreconciliably, contrary to the spirituall maner, which was be∣leeved by the true Disciples of Christ, departed from Christ, and Apostated from the Faith. {fleur-de-lys}For we are to understand, that there is a double [Quomodo] How? The one Insidelitatis: as though it were unpossible to be True in the Sense of the spea∣ker. The other [Quomodo] How? Prudentiae: by inquiring into the Possible Sense of the speaker. Of the first kind was that of the Capernaits, by not beleeving, through their praejudicate understanding of his speach, Contra Christi Sensum. That other is of us Protestants, beleeving the same words, juxta Christi Sensum.{fleur-de-lys} And that the Romish maner of Eating Christ his Body is Capernaiticall; her maner of Sacrifice sacrilegious; her maner of Divine Adoration therof Idolatrous; and all these ma∣ners Irreconciliable to the maner of our Church, is copiously declared in the Books following. For this present we are to exhi∣bit the different, and contradictory maners concerning the Pre∣sence of Christ herein. The maner of Presence of Christ his Body 1. According to the Iudgement of Protestants. 2. In the profession of the Church of Rome.
That Protestants, albeit they deny the Corporall Presence of Christ in this Sacrament; yet hold they a true Presence thereof in divers Respects; according to the Iudge∣ment of Antiquitie. SECT. II. THere may be observed Foure kinds of Truths of Christ his Presence in this Sacrament: one is Veritas Signi, that is, Truth of Representation of Christ his Body; the next is Veritas Revelationis, Truth of Revelation; the third is Veritas Obsigna∣tionis, that is, a Truth of Seale, for better assurance; the last is, Veritas Exhibitionis, the Truth of Exhibiting, and deliverance of the Reall Body of Christ to the faithfull Communicants. The Truth of the Signe, in respect of the thing signified, is to be ac∣knowledged so farre, as in the Signes of Bread and Wine is re∣presented the true and Reall Body and Blood of Christ: which Truth and Realty is celebrated by us, and taught by ancient Fathers, in contradiction to Manichees, Marcionites, and other old Heretikes; who held that Christ had in himselfe no true Body, but meerely Phantasticall, as youMarcionitae, Manichaei, & alij Haeretici putabant corpus Christi verum non esse, sed phan∣tasticum esse. Bellar. lib. 3. de Eucharist. cap. 24. §. Resp. Ar∣gumentum. your selves well know. In confutation of which Heretikes the Father Ignatius (as yourIgnatius (citante Theodoret. Dial 3.) Eucharistia est Caro Christi, Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 2. Hoc scripsit Ignatius con∣tra Haereticos, qui negabant Christum habuisse Carnem ve∣ram, sed tantùm vi∣sibilem & apparen∣tem.—Observan∣dum est, Haereticos illos non tam Sa∣cramentum Eucha∣ristiae, quàm Myste∣rium Incarnationis oppugnâsse. [True, and the Argument of Ignatius was the same which Tertullian used also against the same kinde of Heretikes: Lib. 4. in Marcion. [Hoc est corpus me∣um] Id est, figura corporis mei: Figura autem non fuisset, nisi veritas esset corpus. See this in the place of Ter∣tullian at large. Cardinall witnesseth) called the Eucharist it selfe, the flesh of Christ. Which Saying of Ignatius, in the sense of Theo∣doret, (by whom hee is cited, against the Heresie of his time) doth call it Flesh and Blood of Christ, because (as the same Theodoret expounded himselfe) it is a true signe of the true and Reall Body of Christ. So your Cardinall, even as Tertullian long before him had explained the words of Christ himselfe, [This is my Body] that is (saith hee) This Bread is a Signe, or Figure of my Body. Now because it is not a Signe, which is not of some Truth (See above, Booke 2. Chap. 2.  9. for as much as there is not a figure of a figure) therefore Bread being a Signe of Christs Body, it must follow, that Christ had a true Body. This indeed is Theologicall ar∣guing, by a true Signe of the Body of Christ to confute the He∣retikes, that denyed the Truth of Christ's Body. Which con∣trolleth the wisedome of yourConcilium dicit verò contineri Corpus in Sacramento contra Sacramentarios, qui volunt Christum adesse in Signo, & Figurâ: Signa enim Veritati op∣ponuntur. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 2. Councell of Trent, in con∣demning Protestants, as denying Christ to be Truly present in the Sacrament, because they say, hee is there present in a Signe. As though there were no Truth of being in a Signe, or Figure; which were to abolish all true Sacraments, which are true Fi∣gures, and Signes of the things which they represent.
A second Truth and Realty in this Sacrament is called Veritas Revelationis, as it is a Signe, in respect of the Typical Signs of the same Body and Blood of Christ, in the Rites of the old Testament; yet not absolutely in respect of the matter it selfe, but of the ma∣ner, because the faithfull under the Law had the same faith in Christ: and therfore their Sacraments had Relation to the same Body, and Blood of Christ, but in a difference of maner. For as two Cherubins looked on the same Mercy-Seate, but with dif∣ferent faces oppositely: so did both Testaments point out the same Passion of Christ in his Body, but with divers aspects. For the Rites of the old Testament were, asAugustin. con∣tra Fauslum, lib. 19. pag. 349. Tom. 6. Deltrat, qui dicit mu∣taus Sacramentis res ipsas diversas esse, quas ritus Propheti∣cus pronunciavit im∣plendas, & quas ri∣tus Evangelicus an∣nunciavit impletas.—aliter res an∣nunciatur facienda, aliter facta. Saint Augu∣stine teacheth, Propheticall, prenunciating and fore-telling the thing to come: but the rites of the new Testament are Historicall, annunciating and revealing the thing done: the former shewed, concerning Christ his Passion, rem faciendam, what should bee; the latter rem factam, the thing done, and fulfilled. As there∣fore the Truth of History is held to be more reall than the Truth of Prophecie, because it is a declaration of a reall performance of that, which was promised: So the Evangelicall Sacrament may bee sayd to containe in it a more reall verity, than the Le∣viticall. Therefore are the Rites of the old Law calledHeb. 10. Sha∣dowes, in respect of the Sacraments of the Gospell; according to the which difference Saint Iohn the Baptist was called by Christ a Prophet, in that heIoh. 1. 15. fore-told Christ as now to come: but hee was called more than a Prophet, as demonstrating and Ibid. 19. pointing him out to bee now come. Which Contemplation oc∣casioned divers Fathers to speake so Hyperbolically of the Sacra∣ment of the Eucharist, in comparison of the Sacraments of the old Testament, as if the Truth were in these, and not in them, as Origen. Hom. 7. in Numer. pag. 195. Illa in aenigmate de∣signari, quae nunc in nova Lege in specie & veritate complen∣tur. [Calling ours Truth, yet not simply, but comparatively  for a little after hee confesseth that they received Eandem Es∣cam; id est, Chri∣stum.] Objected by Mr. Brerely, Lirurg. Tract. 4. §. 2. Subd. 4. Origen did. Besides the former two, there is Veritas Obsignationis, a Truth sealed, which maketh this Sacrament more than a Signe, even a Seale of Gods promises in Christ; for so the Apostle called Circumcision, (albeit a Sacrament of the old Law) theRom. 4. 11. Seale of Faith. But yet the print of that Seale was but dimme, in comparison of the Evangelicall Sacraments; which because they confirme unto the faithfull the Truth, which they pre∣sent, are called by other ancient Fathers (as well as byAugust. Tom. 4. de Catechizand. ru∣dib. cap. 26. Signacu∣la esse visibilia rerum divinarum. Saint Augustine) visible Seales of Divine things. So that now we have in this Sacrament the Body of Christ not onely under a Signe, or Signification, but under a Seale of Confirmation also: which inferreth a greater degree of reall Truth, thereby re∣presented unto us. This might have bin the reason why Saint Augustine taught Christ to beAugust. Tract. 50. in Ich. Habemus Christum in praesen∣ti ad Baptismatis Sa∣cramentum: habe∣mus in praesenti ad Altaris cibum & po∣tum. Tom. 9. Present both in Baptisme, and at receiving the Lord's Supper. A fourth Reason to be observed herein, as more speciall, is Veritas Exhibitionis, a Truth Exhibiting and delivering to the
faithfull Communicants the thing signified, and sealed, which Christ expressed, when he delivered it to his Disciples, saying; [Take, eate, this is my Body given for you: and, this is my Blood shed for you.] Thus Christ, by himselfe; and so doth he to other faithfull Communicants whersoever, to the ends of the World, by his Ministers, as by his hands, through virtue of that Roy∣all Command, [DOE THIS.] Vaine therefore is the Ob∣jection made by yourAthanas. apud Theodoret. Dial. 2. pag. 330. Corpus est, cui dicit, Sede à dex∣teris meis—per quod corpus Ponti∣fex fuit, & dictus est, per id quod tradidit mysterium, dicens; Hoc est corpus me∣um. This was objected by Bellarmine. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 11. Cardinall, in urging us with the te∣stimony of Athanasius, to prove that Christ his Body is exhibi∣ted to the Receivers. As though there were not a Truth in a my∣sticall, and Sacramentall deliverance of Christ his Body, ex∣cept it were by a corporall, and materiall presence therof: which is a transparent falsity, as any may perceive by any Deed of Gift, which by writing, seale, and delivery conveyeth any Land or Possession from man to man; yet this farre more effectually, as afterwards will appeare. But first wee are to manifest, That the Romish Disputers do Odiously, Slanderously, and Vncon∣scionably vilifie the Sacrament of the Eucharist, as it is ce∣lebrated by PROTESTANTS. SECT. III. BEllarmine, with othersChristus ni∣hil est illis, nisi fru∣stum panis, & vini portiuncula. Salme∣ron. Ies. in Epist. pauli disput. 11. §. Septimo.

And againe, A morsel of Bread ill baked, by which the Protestants represent unto their memories the death of Christ, and the benefits thereof. A goodly matter! so doth a Cru∣cifix: and to make the Sacrament onely a Signe, is an ancient Here∣sie. So they. But have you not heard the Doctrine of the Protestants, tea∣ching the Eucharisticall Bread to be (more than Bare Bread) a Sa∣cramentall Signe; more, an Evangelicall Signe; more, a Sacred Seale; yet more, an Exhibiting Instrument of the Body of Christ therein to the devout Receiver? And have not these outragi∣ous Spirits read your owne Cardinall? witnessing that the Pro∣testants teach thatDocet Calvinus Symbola, & corpus Christi, licet loco in∣ter se plurimùm di∣sten, tamen con∣juncta esse, non so∣lum ratione signi; quià unum est signum alterius; sed quià per signum Deus verè nobis exhibet ipsum corpus verum, & sanguinem, quo animae nostrae verè alantur. Bellar. l. 1. de Euc. c. 1. it Calvinus affirmat saepiùs, Christi corpus esse praesens in Sacramento quatenus ibi animis nostris verè unitur, & communicatur substantialiter: sic enim loquitur, secundum substantiam, non modò secundum effectum. Et Fortunatus Calvinista dicit, in Sacra∣mento corpus Christi versari realissime{que} percipi. Valent. Ies. Tom. 4. disp. 6. quaest. 3. punct. 1. §. 7. p. 9. Idem Sadael & Beza sentiunt. Idem ibid Haec est eorum sententia; licet Christi corpus corporaliter & essentialiter sit in coelo, nihilominus duplici modo in hoc Sacramento verè percipi, spiritualiter, & sacramentaliter; spiritualiter quidem ore mentis, non dentis, id est, per fidem & cōjunctionem, virtute Spiritus Sancti in animo communicantis: sacra∣mentaliter etiam, ore quidem corporis sumendo, non ipsum quidem corpus ejus, sed signum corporis ejus, pa∣nem, & vinum, quae dicit esse sigilla certa, quibus promissio redemptionis in corpore & sanguine Christi fide∣libus obsignatur. Valent. quo supra. Although the Body of Christ be still in
Heaven, yet is it received in this Sacrament; first Sacramentally by Bodily mouthes, in receiving the Bread, the signe of Christ his Body; and by which God doth truly, albeit Sacramentally, deliver unto the faithfull the reall Body of Christ: and secondly spiritually to the mouth of the soule by Faith, and so they truly and really partici∣pate of the substance of the Body and Blood of Christ. So Bellar∣mine, concerning Protestants, which is so plainly professed by Calvin, in his Booke intituted, De∣fensio Carvini de Sacramento.

Ibid. pag. 83. Calvin himselfe, as would make any Romish Adversary blush at your former Calumnies, who hath not abandoned shamefastnesse it selfe. {fleur-de-lys}As that your Doctor must needs have done,Dr. Heskins in his Parliam. of Christ. Book. 3. cap. 48. who therefore upbraided Protestants with their Common Bread, onely because they denyed it to be Transubstantiated into Christ's Body; even in the same his Booke, wherein notwithstanding, he confesseth the Shew-Bread, delivered to David by Abimelech, to have beene no Common Bread. Which, because it was before Christ incar∣nate in the flesh, you your selves will sweare was not Tran∣substantiated into the Body of Christ; and yet notwithstan∣ding, was it no Common Bread. CHALLENGE. THus may you see that wee have not hitherto so pleaded for the Existence of the Substance of Bread in this Sacra∣ment, after Consecration, as thereby to exclude all Presence of Christ his Body; nor so maintained the proprietie of a Signe, or Figure, as not to beleeve the thing signified to be ex∣hibited unto us, as you have heard. With what blacke spot of malignity and falshood then were the Consciences of those your Doctors defiled, thinke you, who have imputed to Pro∣testants a Profession of using onely bare Bread, which they notwithstanding teach and beleeve to bee a Sacred Signe of the true Body of Christ, in opposition to Heretikes; an Evangelicall Signe of the Body of the Messias crucified, a∣gainst all Iewish conceit; yea, a Seale of Ratification; yea, and also a Sacramentall Instrument of conveying of the same preci∣ous
Body of Christ to the soules of the faithfull, by an happy and ineffable Conjunction? whereof more hereafter in theIn the fift Book, throughout. Booke following, where the consonant doctrine of the Church of Eng∣land will likewise appeare. And as your Disputers are convinced of a malicious Detracti∣on, by the confessed positions of Protestants, so are they much more by your owne Instance of a Crucifix for which of you would not hold it a great derogation from Christ, that any one seeing a Crucifix of wood (now waxen old) should in disdaine thereof call it a wooden, or rotten Blocke, and not account them irreligious in so calling it? but why? onely because it is a signe of Christ crucified. Notwithstanding, were the Cru∣cifix as glorious as either Art could fashion, or Devotion affect, or Superstition adore, yet is it but a signe invented by man. And therefore how infinitely more honourable in all Christian estimation must a Sacramentall Signe be, which onely the God of Heaven and Earth could institute, and Christ hath ordained to his Church, farre exceeding the property of a bare signe, as you have heard? A Father delivering by politike assurances under hand and seale a portion of Land, although an hundred miles distant, and conveying it to his Sonne by Deed, if the Sonne in scorne should terme the same Deed or writing, blacke Inke; the Seale, greasie Waxe; and the whole Act but a bare signe, were he not worthy not only to loose this fatherly Bene∣fit, but also to be deprived of all other the temporall Blessings of a Father, which hee might otherwise hope to enjoy? yet such like have beene your Calumnies, and opprobrious Reproa∣ches against our celebration of the Sacrament of Christ. The Lord lay not them to your Charge. Now you, who so oppose against the Truth of the Mysticall Presence, will not conceale from us that Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ, which your Church doth so extremely dote on.

OVr Methode requireth to consult, in the first place, in all Questions, with the words of Christ his In∣stitution; but seeing that you can allege nothing for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ in this Sacrament, but only a literall Exposition of Christ's words [This is my Body:] which by Scriptures, Fathers, your owne Principles, and by unanswerable Reasons hath beeneBooke 2. proved to be most grosly false, wee shall not need to insist further upon that; only wee shall but put you in mind of Saint Pauls words, in teaching the use and end of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament, to wit, The shewing of Christ's death untill his coming againe: meaning corporally, at the last day. Which word [VNTILL,] being spoken of a last day, doth exclude your coming againe of Christ in his Cor∣porall Presence every day; for the Apostles word is absolutely spoken of his Bodily Coming, and not of the maner therof; al∣beit other Scripture teach, that his Coming must be in all glo∣rious Visibility. We goe on. In the Eucharist (saith yourSi quis nega∣verit in sanctissima Eucharistia contineri verè, realiter, sub∣stantialiter corpus, & sanguinem Christi Anathema sit. Concil. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 1. Nos dicimus Domi∣num Christum cor∣poralitèr sub specie panis conemeri. Gre. Valent. Tom. 4. disp. 6. qu. 3. pag 1. Councell of Trent) is contained truly, really, and substantially the Body, and Blood of Christ: and they account him Accursed, whosoever shall not beleeve this. By all which is signified a Corporall maner of presence (excep∣ting onely Relation to place) which we say is, in many respects, impossible, as wee shall prove; but first wee are to remove two Mil-stones, for so you esteeme your Objections, which you cast in our way of Demonstration of a Corporall Presence; First, de facto, from (as you say) Miracles manifesting the same. And the Second is your Pretence of Omnipotencie, for the effectua∣ting that Presence. The pretended principall Romish Demonstration of a Corpo∣rall Presence of Christ's Body and Blood, in this Sacra∣ment, taken from pretendedSupremus Io∣rus detur miraculis; veluti testimonis  Dei. Bozius de finis Eccles lib 14. cap. 7. pag. 170. Miraculous Ap∣paritions of visible Flesh, and Blood, re∣vealed to the World. SECT. II. TRue Miracles wee shall hold as Gods Seales of Divine Truth: if therefore you shall allege any such, for proofe of
a Corporall Presence, see they be true, else shall wee judge them, not to be Gods Seales, but the Devills Counterfaits. Your Bo∣zius, one of the number of the Congregation of the Oratory in Rome (professedly studied in historicall learning, and appointed to extract out of all Authors, whatsoever may make for defence of all Romish Causes) after his diligent search into all ancient Records, as it were into the Ware-houses of all sorts of stuffes, having collected a packet of Apparences, useth his best Elo∣quence to set forth his merchandize to sale; telling us by the way of Preface,Hic ea tan∣tummodò referemus, quibus est palam fa∣ctum divinitus in Eu∣charistia verum cor∣pus esse, & oculi hu∣mani viderunt, & quod est omnium micbilissimum vide∣re adhuc possint pa∣nem conversum in ipsam carnem Chri∣sti. Bozius de Sig. Eccles. lib. 14. cap. 7. that he will report onely such Stories, wher∣by it is made Evident by God himselfe, that the Body of Christ is in the Eucharist, even by the Testimony of mens eyes, that have seene it. A thing (saith hee) most miraculous, which every one that hath eyes may yet see. So he, even asCoccius The∣saur. Cathol. lib. 6. de Eucharistia. Coccius be∣fore him, in every particular: and after both M.In the place below-cited. Brerely thus prefacing; Miracles sent by God confirme the same, wherein at the breaking of the Hoast, sundry times great copie of blood issued out, as is testified by many Writers. Wee are now attentive to the Re∣lation of your Orator and Others, and afterwards (as you shall perceive) to give that credit unto them, which the cause it selfe shall require. We will take their Relations according to the or∣der of Times. I. Anno CCCC. Simon Metaphrastes (saithSimon Meta∣phrastes narrat, &c. Bozius ibid. Bozius) tel∣leth in the dayes of Honorius the Emperour (for the confirmation of the faith of an Eremite) that the Sacrament being propounded, presently [Infans visus est] a living Infant was seene by three old men on the Altar: and whilest the Priest divided the Bread, an An∣gell was seene, and seemed to divide, and cut in pieces the flesh of the Child, and so [Senex carnis cruentae apertè particeps factus est, & resipiscit,] The old Heremite being made partaker evidently of the Bloody flesh repented. II. Anno 600. A woman (asIohannes, & Paulus Diaconus in vita Gregorij narrat, &c. Bozius ibid. & Coccius Thesaur. li. 6. de Euch. art. 8. Anno 590. And Masser Brerely Tract. 4. §. 3. Subd. 1. out of Paulus Diaconus, de vita Greg. lib. 2. cap. 41. Bozius reporteth, and with him Coccius) had laughed to heare the Bread called the Body of Christ, which she her selfe had made with her owne hands, and was observed to laugh by Pope Gregory: who thereupon fell to prayer with the peo∣ple, and by and by looking aside upon the Hoast, behold the formes of Bread were vanished, and he saw [Veram carnem] true flesh: Then the people wondred, the woman repented, and the Hoast, at the prayer of the Priest [in pristinam formam reversa est] Returned into it's owne shape againe. III. Anno 800.Ante Annos propè octingentos, ut narrat Pascasius, qui∣dam Presbyter, &c. Bozius ibid. & Coc∣cius. A certaine Priest called Phlegis, being de∣sirous to see Christ in the Eucharist, not that he doubted thereof, but that he might receive some heavenly comfort [Divinitùs] from God, after prayers for this purpose, he saw (after Consecration) [Puerum Iesum,] The Child Iesus, in the Hoast, [& amplexatus est eum, & post multam deosculationem, &c.] he embraced him, and after much kissing of him, he desired to receive the Sacrament, and
the Vision vanished, and hee received it. So hee. These two last, are also alleged by your CardinallBellar. lib. 3. de Eur. cap. 8. Deus non est testis menda∣, &c. Bellarmine. IV. Not many yeares after a fourth in Italy,E Guitmun lo, & Lanfnco, Bo∣zius & Coccius Ibid. A Priest say∣ing Masse, and sinding [Veram carnem super Altare, verumque sanguinem in Calice,] True flesh upon the Altar, and true Blood in the Cup, fearing to receive it, forthwith reported it to the Bishop, demanding what hee should do; The Bishop consulted with the o∣ther Bishops his Brethren, by whose common consent the Priest ta∣king the Cup and the flesh, shut them up in the middest of the Al∣tar, [Haec pro divinissimis miraculis summa cum reverentia ser∣vanda decrevit,] The Bishop decreed, that these should be perpe∣tually reserved, and kept as most divine Reliques. V. Anno 1050.Tempore quo, urgente nefando Be∣rengario, haec in con∣troversiam sunt ad∣ducta, ut Deus ad∣stipulatus intellig∣tur veritati, & refra∣gatus errori, &c. Ba∣ronius Anno 1059. num. 20. ex Petro Damino. Cardinall Baronius will needs have you know, that Berengarius was confirmed by a like miracle from God, as the Bishop of Amalphi (saith he) witnesseth to Pope Stephen upon his oath; That when he was doubting of the Truth of the Body of Christ, in the Sacrament, at the breaking of the Hoast [Rubra & perfecta caro inter ejus manis apparuit, ita ut digitos ejus cruentaret,] Red and perfect flesh appeared betwixt his hands, insomuch that his hands were bloodied therewith. VI. Anno 1192. Behold an Historie (saith yourQuae admiranda hoc seculo in Sla∣vorum Historiâ, au∣thore Helmoldo Ab∣bate, hujus seculi nar∣rantur fide dignissi∣ma, accipe. His fer∣me diebus, &c. Ba∣ron. An. 119. num. 20. & 21. Haec de Transubstantione: consutavit item idem miraculum Haeresin nuper obortam ne∣gantium aquam vino mixtam mutari in sanguinem. Baronius ibid. num. 24. Cardinall Ba∣ronius) most worthy of beliefe (you must believe it.) At Thuring after that the Priest had given the Sacrament to a young Girle then sicke, and had washed his fingers in a pot of water, shee observing it very diligently, willed them that were by to uncover the water, for I saw (said shee) a piece of the Eucharist fall out of the hands of the Priest into it: which being brought unto her to drinke, all the water was turned into Blood, and the piece of the Hoast, albeit no bigger than a mans finger, was turned [In sanguineam car∣nem] into a bloody flesh. All that see it are in horrour, the Priest himselfe, suspecting his owne negligence, feareth, and wisheth that it may be burned. After was this made knowne, and divulged to the Bishop of Mentz. This Archbishop commandeth his Cler∣gie to wait upon this, whilst it should be carried in publike procession untill they came into the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, where prayers are made by the Archbishop, that God would be plea∣sed to retransforme this [in primam substantiam panis, & vini,] into the former substance of Bread and Wine: and so at length it came to passe. Thus far the Story. This (saith the same Cardinall) maketh for Transubstantiation, and confuteth the Heresie of those that deny that water mixed with the Eucharist is turned into Blood. So hee. VII. Anno 1230.Bozius quo supra ex Filiano. A Priest in Florence looking into the Cha∣lice saw drops of Blood divided into parts, and joyning together a∣gaine, in Abbesse lendeth the Priest a Violl to put the Blood in, which the third day after appeared to be flesh. This flesh is still reser∣ved in a Cristall glasse in the Church of Saint Ambrose in Flo∣rence;
and although the outward formes therof be somewhat darke, yet are they to be seene of all Travellers. So hee. VIII. Anno 1239.Bozius quo supra. In the Kingdome of Valentia [Verè memorabile] a thing truly memorable; In the time of the warres be∣tweene the Christians and Mahumetans there was seene of the Priest in the Altar pieces of the Hoast inclosed in linnen, and sprink∣led with drops of Blood, which Hoast afterwards by advice was laid, with all reverence, on the backe of a Mule to be carried to that place, wheresoever the Mule should make a stand. The Mule (al∣though inticed often by Provander to stand els-where) never made stay untill hee came to an Hospitall of Dorchara, where falling downe upon his knees (lest hee might afterwards carry any thing lesse noble, and worthy than that Hoast) [protenus expiravit] hee suddenly died. IX.Bozius ibid. ex Villano, &c. Anno 1258. When the Priest celebrated the Masse in the Kings Chappel at Paris, and was now in elevating the Hoast, to shew it unto the people, many of them presently saw [formosissimum puerum a most beautifull Child: And out of the Eucharist [sanguis copiosus emanavit] much Blood issued; so that this cannot bee imputed to the Art of the Devill. X. Anno 1261.Bozius ibid. and Onuphrius in Vita Vr∣bani Quarti. Vivus Sanguis ex Hostia manavit, & totam mappam, quam Cor∣porale vocant, tinxi. [Illustrissimum illud] The most famous, upon occasion whereof the Feast of Corpus Christi day was first instituted, which Panvinus mentioneth in the life of Pope Vrban the Fourth, when there issued out of the Eucharist [sanguis copio∣sus] Abundance of Blood. So that it cannot be attributed to the cun∣ning of the Devill. XI. Anno 1273.Bozius ibid. A Miracle was seene at Picenum, where a woman reserved the Eucharist, which shee should have eaten, and kept it with purpose to abuse it for recovering the love of her Huband by Magicke; The Hoast shee laid on Coales, and it present∣ly turned into flesh: Shee was astonished, but concealed it by the space of seven yeares, at length shee discovereth it to a Priest, hee found this flesh being hid so long in a Dung-hill [intactam, & il∣laesam] perfect, and entire: hee published this Miracle, which moved infinite numbers to come and see it. And even now, after, it doth yet incite men to come and visit it, for the flesh is seene after so many yeares uncorrupt, to the eternall memory thereof. XII. Anno 1510.Bozius ibid. At Knobloch, a Village under the Mar∣quisate of Brandenburgh, one Paulus Formosus on a night stole the Pix wherein the Eucharist was reserved, hee sold it to a Iew, The Iew pierced it through with a Dagger, and Blood flowed out, &c. Most of all these are related by MasterMaster  in his Booke of the Laturgie of the Mass, pag. 188. & 399. Brerely Priest; whereupon hee maketh this Conclusion: Miracles shewed by God (saith he) do forceably confirme the same, for at breaking of the Hoast at sundry times great copie and abundance of Blood issued out, as hath beene formerly testified. So they. It were pitie, when as so many Countries have beene gra∣ced
with such Miracles, England should be thought unworthy of like honour; nay here also wee heare there was (Anno 950.) at CanterburyMaster Foxe Acts and Monuments, pag. 11. Ex Ober∣ac, in vita . a Miracle wrought for confirming divers Clergy men (then wavering) in the Doctrine of Transubstantia∣tion, by a Bloody dropping of the Hoast at Masse. Such as these are the Miracles, whereof your Iesuite boasteth, saying,Mr. Mallon Ies his Reply, Epist. to the Read. r. I have enlarged my selfe in the Article of the Reall Presence, because it is a matter of great importance: in which Argument I have alleged many miraculous Demonstrations, re∣corded by Writers of great credit, in Confirmation of the Ca∣tholike Cause. So he. But of what credit your Historians are, who report these; what Conscience your Disputers have to object these; give us first leave to diseusse, and wee shall easily permit it to the Iudgement of any Conscional man, to make his owne Conclusion. {fleur-de-lys} That these were not Apparitions of true Flesh, and true Blood of Christ, by the judgement of Ro∣mish Schoole-men. SECT III. YOur Bellarmine, Baronius, Bozius, Master Brerely, and Coc∣cius have, for proofe of the Corporall Presence of Christ, in∣sisted upon Apparitions of (as they have sayd) true flesh, red flesh, perfect flesh of the Infant Iesus; and the child Iesus seene, embra∣ced and kissed in the Eucharist: of Wine turned into blood, of Drops of Blood, sprinkling drops of Blood, issuing out, and bloodying the fingers of the Priest, that saw it. But wee rather beleeve your Schoole-men, of whom (besides manyRevera videri Christum in specie pueri, aut carnis opi∣antur, sed cum du∣tione, Alensis, Gbriel, Palacius. Srez. Ies. Tom 3. Disp. 5. §. 2 p. 710. that doubted) divers, toge∣ther with Thomas Aquinas, with the Thomists, & other Authors, alleged by your Iesuit Suarez, denyed all this, saying,Dicendum est in hujusmodi appari∣tione non videri Christum in se: ita Thomas, & omnes Thomistae. Suarez. ibid Quandò appet this species, quidam da∣cunt, quod est propria species Christi corporis, nec obstare dicunt, quod aliquas tautium pas carnis, aut quod species pueri appareat, quà potest Christus  qua vult specie apparere in propria sivaena: sed hoc est incon∣veniens, quia species Christi non potest in propria specie videri, nisi  uno locò, in quo definitive continent: undè videatur in propria specie in coelis, non videtur in hoc Sacramento.

Iesuit. quo supra. And the Iesuite Sillivitius Seneasie, Moral. quaest. Tom. 1. Tract. 4 cap. 4. & 5. Num. 142. & 101. In istis apparitionibus non videtur caro et sanguis in se, sed tantùm figura et color illam referens. That in such Apparitions there is no True flesh, nor true Blood of Christ at all. Their Reasons: First, Becausè Christ (say they) cannot appeare in his owne proper forme, in two places at once. Secondly,
Because it were hainous wickednesse to inclose Christ in a Boxe, ap∣pearing in his owne forme. Thirdly, Because Christs Blood to issue, and sprinkle out of his veines, who can easily beleeve? (yea, and your Iesuite Coster, with some Others, spare not to professe, as well as wee, thatSee the fixt Booke, Chap. 1. §. 4. Shedding of Christs Blood out of his Body, was onely on the Crosse.) Fourthly, Because it were Vndecencie to reserve such Reliques, experience teaching that they do putrifie. Thus your owne Schoole-men produced, and approved by Suarez the Iesuite, whose Conclusion and Resolution is, that The flesh thus appearing is not only not the flesh of Christ, but even no true flesh at all, but onely a colour and signe thereof. {fleur-de-lys} Fiftly, You have here before you (in the Margin) your Iesuite Vasquez, denying those to bee the Apparitions of true Flesh; and as though none but simple people were deceived with such Apparitions, he holdeth it sufficient thatVasquez. Ies. in 3. Thom. Quaest. 76. Art. 8 Disput. 193. Cap. 2. Respondeo, Neque apparere car∣nem Christi, neque alterius, quae reverà caro sit, sed carnis so∣lùm effigiē.—Quod autem simplices de∣cipiantur, & credant ibi esse carnem Chri∣sti divisibili & cruen∣to modo, parum re∣fert: haec enim de∣ceptio instructione verâ Doctorum & Pastorum corrigen∣dus est. Their De∣ception herein may bee corrected by the true instruction of the Learned. How will your Bozius, Coccius, Bellarmine, and your many other Doctors together with their Beleevers, disgest this; to bee thus ranked by this your Iesuite among the Simple and Ignorant people in this their deliration, concer∣ning such fictitious Apparitions? {fleur-de-lys} Do you not then see the different faith of your owne Histo∣rians, and of your owne Divines? namely that those Histo∣rians, as uncleane Beasts, swallow downe at the first whatsoever cometh into their mouthes: but those your Divines, like more Cleane creatures, do ruminate and distinguish truth from false∣hood, by sound reason and judgement, and prove the Authors of such Apparitions flat lyars; the Reporters uncredible Wri∣ters; and the Beleevers of them starke Fooles. That the Romish Answer, to free their former pretended Mi∣raculous Apparitions from suspicion of Figments, or Illusions, is Vnsufficient. SECT. IV. ALbeit in these Apparitions there be not true flesh (sayQuamvis non fiat, ut vera caro Christi, vel reverà vera caro (ut respon∣dent Thomistae) sed tantum color & figu∣ra ejus, tamen quòd sit externa species, sive imago divinitùs facta, sufficiens est ad confirmationem veritatis. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disput. 55. Sect. 2. some of your Doctors) yet such Apparitions, being miracu∣lously wrought, are sufficient Demonstrations that Christs Flesh is in the Eucharist. But why should not wee yeeld more credit to those Schoole-men, who sayAlens. Gabriel. Palacius dicunt quòd miracula siunt veris, & non apparentibus signis & figuris—Asserunt talem apparitionem non esse factam virtute Dei, sed Daemonis. Suarez Ibid. [Where hee addeth, Hoc ab ijs gratis dictum est.] True miracles use to bee made in true signes, and not in such as seeme onely so to bee; because seeming signes are wrought by the Art of the Devill? And wee
take it from the Assurance, which your Iesuite giveth us, that Potest Dae∣mon repraesentare fi∣guras quarum libet re∣rum, ut argenti, auti, epul rum, quem∣admodum perssi∣mi Sculprores & Pi∣ctores vtias fomas, & figur rerum ità finguam, ut interdum verae esse videantur. Sed verè & propriè miraculum id dicitur opus, quod omnis aturae creatae vum at{que} potentiam exce∣dit. Et una differen∣tia, quâ vera mira∣cula possunt à falsis discerni, haec est, quòd falsa sunt phā∣tastica, & simulata, ideo{que} non diturna: vel sunt planè inutilia. Perer. Ies. in Ex. 7 Disp. 4. Num. 34. & D. 5. N. 36 38. Tertia ratio sum potest ad confirmandam veritatem Corporis, ex dignitat personae corpus assumentis: quae cum sit veritas, non de∣cuit ut in ejus opere aliqua sictio insit. Aquin. part 3. qu. 5. Ait. 2 Devils and Painters can make such semblances and Simili∣tudes: and that true Miracles are to bee discerned from false, in that false Miracles carry onely a likenesse of things, and are un∣profitable. Furthermore, yourp Aquinas proveth against the Heretikes, from Sense, that Christ had a true Body, Because it could not agree with the dignity of his person, who is Truth, that there should be any fiction in any worke of his. Thus stand you still confuted by your owne domesticall witnesses. Wee may adde this Reason, why there could be no Resem∣blances of Truth, because all the personall Apparitions are said to bee of an Infant, and of the Child Iesus; albeit Christ, at his Ascension out of this World,Baron. An. 34. was 34. yeares of age: and yet now behold Christ an Infant 34. yeares old! as if your had beheld Christ, with the Magi, in Bethelehem, at the time of his birth; and not in Bethaven, with his Disciples, at the instant of his Ascension. Of the Suggesters of such Apparitions; and of their Complices: SECT. V. THe first Apparition of flesh above-mentioned was not be∣fore the dayes of the Emperour Arcadius, which was about the yeare 395. The second not untill 700. yeares after Christ; nor is it read of any like Apparition in all the dayes of Antiqui∣tie, within the compasse of so long a time; excepting that of one Marcus, recorded byIrenaeus adver∣sus, Haereses lib. 1. c. 9. Marcus purpureum & rubicundum appa∣rere facit, ut purare∣tur ea gratia sangui∣nem stillare in Ca∣licem per invocatio∣nem per magu illum. Irenaeus, who faigned to Make the mix∣ed Wine in the Cup, through his Invocation, to seeme red, that it might bee thought, that grace had infused Blood into the Cup: which the same Father noteth to have beene done by Magicke; at what time there were dayly Proselytes and new Converts to the Christian Religion, and on the other side divers rankes of Heretikes, as namely, Valentinians, Manichees, Marcionites, and others, who all denyed, that Christ had any corporall, or Bodily Substance at all. Were it not then a strange thing that so many Apparitions should be had in after-times, in Churches established in Christian Religion, concerning the truth of Christs Body, and no such one heard of in these dayes of Antiquity, when there seemed to bee a farre more necessary use of them, both for confirming Proselytes in the faith, and reducing Here∣tikes from their Errour? that Apparition only of Marcus excep∣ted
which the Church of Christ did impute to the Diabolicall Art of Magicke. As for the Reporters, much need not to be said of them; Si∣mon Metaphrastes is the first, who was of that small Credit with your Cardinall, that, in Answer to an Objection from the same Author, he sayd;Bellar. lib. 2. de Pont. c. 5. §. Neque. And Baronius: Si qua fides adhibenda est Metaphrasti, qui nullā hic meretur fi∣dem. Ann. 44. num. 38. I am not much moved with what Meta∣phrastes saith. And if the Fore-man of the inquest be of no better esteeme, what shall one then thinke of the whole Packe: As for the testimony under the name of Amphilochius (objected by yourCoccius Thesaur. Catho. de Eucharistia. And Dr. Heskins in his Parlia, of Christ. Coccius) writing the life of Basil, and mentioning the like Apparitions of Flesh, wee make no more account of it, than do your twoSed haud dubio falsa, vel supposititia. Lib. de Script. Eccles. Tit. Amphilochius; & Cardin. Baron. ad Ann. 378. num. 10. Cardinalls, by whom it is rejected as Supposititi∣ous and Bastardly. But the Suggesters of these Apparitions, what were they? (a matter observable) ordinarily Priests, to∣gether with either old men, women, and sometimes young Girles, who (wheresoever Superstition raigneth) are knowne to bee most prone thereunto. That we say nothing of the lewd Iug∣lings of your Priests, who in other kinds have bin often discove∣red amongst us, and in other Countries. Wee conclude. A true Miracle, for confirmation of Religion (wee are sure) is Divinum opus, the Infidell Magicians being in∣forced to confesse as much, saying,Exod. 8. 19. Digitus Dei hic est. And as sure are wee that a fained miracle (although it be in behalfe of Religion) is impious and blasphemous against God, who being the God of Truth, neither will, nor can be glorified by a lie:Iob. 13. 7. Hath God need of a Lie? (saith holy Iob.) Wee right willingly acknowledge, that divers Miracles have bin wrought, for verifying the Eucharist to be a Divine Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ: but to be it selfe the true and substantiall flesh of Christ, not one. When aSocrat. hist. lib. 7. cap. 17. Iew, that had beene once Baptized by one Bishop, betooke himselfe to another Bishop, to be againe Baptized of him, in hope of profit, The Water in the Font presently vanished away.Aug. de Civit. lib. 22. cap. 8. Medi∣cum podagricum non solùm dolore, quo ultrà solitum cue a∣batur: verumetiam podagrâ catusse, nc amplius quam d vi∣xisset pedes doluisse. Saint Augustine telleth of a Physician, who was vexed extremely with the Gout, and at his Baptisme was freed from all paine, and so continued all his life long.Baron. An. 384. Num. 19. Baronius reporteth another of a Child fallen into a little Well, prepared for men of age to be Baptized in, and af∣ter that it was held for drowned, in the opinion of all by-stan∣ders, at the prayer of Damascus it arose from the bottome, as whole and sound as it was before. These Miracles happened not for the dignifying of the Matter, which was the water of Baptisme, but of the nature of the Sacrament it selfe, albeit voyd of the Corporall presence of Christ. Not to tell you (which yourTanta suit E∣vangelij authoritas, ut etiam codices ipsi miracula ediderint: ut Gregorius Tureneusis in vità Patrum narrat de S Gallo, qui Evangeliorum codice accepto, civitatis incen∣dium tesit:  & S Marus, Ecclesià S. Anastasiae slagrante, teste Nicephoro, lib. 5. cap. 22. Durant. de Ritib lib. 2. cap. 23. num. 22. Durantus will have you to know) of Miracles,
wrought by the Booke of the Gospell, for the extinguishing of Fers. And the former Histories do in most of the premised Exam∣ples report as well the Adoration given to the former Appari∣tions of a No-Christ, and of his No-Flesh; as they doe unto Christ himselfe: which, beside the Absurditie of their Opi∣nion, doth involve them in a grosse Idolatrie, whereof Wee are to treate in the seaventh Booke. {fleur-de-lys} A Digression upon occasion of a late Discourse of a greatly priviledged Doctor, concerning the Histories, mentioning the Blood of Christ miraculously Separated from his Body (which will be pertinent to the Point in question) wherein wee may finde ma∣ny Observables. SECT VI. FRancis Collius, Professor of Divinitie at Millan, is the Author; whose Booke is Authorized (as theFrancisus Col∣lius Teologiae. Da∣ctor, De Sanguine Christi mraculo  Anno 1618.

Mar∣gin sheweth) With a publike privilege, and Commendation of ALL the Doctors of the College of Saint Ambrose. His whole Discourse is of this onely Subject, THE BLOOD OF CHRIST. Out of which wee have singled Three especiall Points, incident to our present purpose, concerning The Blood of Christ Separated out of his Body, specified in Ro∣mish Histories. The first Separation thereof is said to be made in the miraculous Apparitions in the Eucharist: The Second out of the Images and Reliques: The Third of the Blood which issued out of Christ's side at his Passion; wherof Some parts are also storied to be kept as Reliques in divers Countries in Christendome. I. Of that Blood, which is reported to have Miraculous∣ly Issued out of Christ's Body visibly in the Eucharist. Of this First kinde, you have heard the Romish Stories, in good number, objected by your Priests and Iesuites in great earnest, for proofe of a Corporall presence in the Sacrament, in the name of True Blood, and Visible, flowing out of the same Body; and thereupon the Common and solemne wor∣ship given thereunto, wheresoever the aforesaid Appari∣tions are recorded to have beene. Now entreth in your Au∣thor Collius, speaking unto you in an higher straine (in the Margin) than this is; which wee shall render unto you in

Whose Eares can abide to heare, the Blood of Christ, now after his glo∣rious Resurrection, to have been separated out of the naturall receptacles of his veines? Yea, who can without horror thinke therof, especially seeing Experience telleth us, that the same Blood, which appeared, did vanish away, putrifie, and corrupt? Wher∣fore, It will be our safest Resolution, according to the Consent of Divines, to affirme, that no mortall eye of man did ever behold the TRV BLOOD of Christ, since his Triumphant piercing of the Heavens. Hitherto your publike Professor, according herein with Thomas Aquinas (whom hee calleth the An∣gelicall Doctor) and with other famous Divines. But present∣ly (whereas his cited Doctors furthermore Conclude, None of those Apparitions to have beene of any True flesh at all, but onely Shaddowes, and Representations thereof) hee cra∣veth leave to depart from them, affirming it to be, although not the True flesh of Christ, yet True flesh: and leaveth them questioning against this his Assertion, concerning these Miraculous Apparitions; What True flesh then it might be, Whether the flesh of Bests, or of a Man; Whether newly Created, or Commentitiously obtruded? Hee answereth, yet so, that whereas your Stories, and all their Reporters and Wor∣shippers of such Apparitions do equally esteeme of All, as being a like Truely flesh; hee teacheth them to distinguish of the Apparitions, which are said to have vanished shortly after their first shew, & the other that were of a longer continuance and to acknowledge the Existence of the True flesh, onely in the Second kinde. In the last place, opposing against the Generall Opinion of Thomas, and other of your choicest Divines (above-men∣tioned) who held these to be meerly Apparitions, without any Substance of flesh, Hee, albeit granting that a Ficti∣tious Apparition may be truly Miraculous, yet to make the same Opinion Ridiculous, breaketh out, and inveigheth in this maner;Quosunt? (C. 6. contra eos qui dicunt tantùm fictitum esse sanguinem illum, qui per long a intervaa corspicitur. Idē Author Collius. Quis sibi persuadere poterit largissimos rubri coloris liquores, qui ex sacra mensa non semel eruperunt, nulla procreata substantia, effuere, & vasa at{que} calices implerè posse? certe capiant, si liber, & istud credant alij, mihi enim uti captu, ita creditu semper difficillimum visum est—(Qui tmn paulò post) An credant illa Accidentia esse, qusia fides Catholica consecrati calicis in Eucharistia scimus esse?—Cap. 7.

Who Can perswade himselfe, that such abun∣dance of lquor of red colour, which is said to have issued out of the Eucharist, filling the Chalices, and other vessels, should be wholly Fictitious, and Accidents without Substances? Let others understand and believe this, if they please, for my part I must confesse it was alwayes beyond my Capacity and Credu∣lity. So your Doctor, of his supposed Miraculous Appari∣tions;
Notwithstanding he hath no more Foundation either out of Scripture, or from any Tradition out of the Primi∣tive Church of Christ, for Meere Accidents without Substance, in that which he saith he believeth; than he hath in the other which he believeth not, but declameth against, as you have heard. II. The same Authors Discourse upon the Romish Stories, con∣cerning the mentioned Reliques of Christs Blood, issued out Miraculously from Images. SECT. VII. VVHereas Aquinas, with Others, out of many Histo∣ries, have approved of many Apparitions of Blood in great abundance at Mantua, Venice, Rome, and els-where flow∣ing out of Images: This your Doctor concludeth with him∣selfe, thatIdem Collius. lib. 5.

Ob. Sol. Diploma Pij Secundi tantum dicit, non repugnare Fidei doctrinae, sanguinem Christi aliquem relictum, esse in terris. Ob Sol. Non solum probabilis ac vera propemodum opinio est, eam historiam de per∣cussu Imaginis Christi, non fuisse Athanast magni, sed alterius Doctoris ejusdem nominis—quae tamen, si ejus fuisse dicatur—tamen unius Sancti Patris authoritas ad rm tanquam de fide stabiliendam non suffi∣ciet.—Et approbatio Synodi Nycenae secundae non est existimanda cadere in totum, ac singulas Istius histo∣riae partes, sed solum quadrare in historiam perfossae Imaginis, &c. Quod ad Brigittae Revelationem spectat; etsi sit e maximi ponderis, tamen non tan tamque efficacis censenda est, ut ab ea discedere impium ac ili∣giosum fuit. Albeit Some portion of the Blood of Christ might be sayd to remaine on earth, yet can it not be thought, that such a copious measure of Blood, as is reported, should have bin: Because, although each Country glory and boast of such their Reliques, as being Christs Blood (for that as the Proverb is, EVERY ONE THINKETH HIS OVVNE BEST;) yet could not so great Quantities of Blood, as filled whole ves∣sels, be sayd to issue out of Christs Body, without some iujury to that perfection of his glorious Body. And therefore Hee that shall beleeve that, let him heare that notable saying of Solomon, Hee that is of a sodaine Beliefe, hath a light and inconstant heart.] By occasion of this Question, thus prosecuted, they start (as it were) another Hare, questioning whether it bee a matter of Faith to beleeve the Blood, so appearing, to be the Blood of Christ? One side affirming it to be, grounding them∣selves, as they thought, upon Bulls of the Popes of Rome;
upon a pretended Testimonie of Athanasius; and upon the Divine Revelations of Saint Bridget: On the contrary side, your Doctor qualifieth the Approbations of Popes; excep∣teth against the pretended Testimony of Athanasius (and just∣ly) as counterfeit; and denieth that the Revelation of Saint Bridget can be sufficient to prove it to be Impious and irreli∣gious, not to beleeve the contrary. III. As for the third point, of the Blood of Christ shed at his Passion, wee leave themId. Disp. 9. cap. 2. An portio aliquas de sanguine effuso in passione relicta fue∣rit in orbe tertarum?

All this our Relation hath no other Ayme, than to shew the Vnconscionablenesse of your Dis∣puters, in requiring Faith of Others, to beleeve such and such Apparitions of Christs Blood, which they themselves, by their owne Reasons, Contradictions, and Conclusions have made uncredible.

NO sooner do you heare Protestants talke of the Im∣possibility20 30 of your maner of Presence, which your Church prescribeth, but you presently cry out upon them, as upon Blasphemous Detractors from the Omnipotencie of God; as if they meantAbsit ut fide∣lis quispiam aurem accommodet impijs Sacramentarijs, qui excaecatâ mente om∣nipotentiam Christi in hoc Sacramento vel comprehendere detrectant: quòd tan∣quam pestem letha∣lem vitae, & intellectum nostrum in obsequium Christi cap tivare debemus.

We hold it necessary therefore to remove this Scandall, thus cast in the way for simple people to stumble upon, before we can conveniently proceed to the maine matter; and this wee shall endeavour to do by certaine Propositions.
I. That, by the Iudgement of ancient Fathers, some things (by reason of Contradiction in them) may be called Impossible, with∣out the impeachment of the Omnipotency of God; yea, with the great advance∣ment thereof. SECT. II. THis Proposition accordeth to the judgement of ancient Fa∣thers, shewing thatAug. de Civit. lib. 5. cap. 10. Dici∣tur Deus omnipotens faciendo quod vult, non faciendo quod non vult: quod si ac∣cideret, neququam esset omnipotens: un∣de proptereà quae∣dam non potest, quia est omnipotens: non potest mori, non peccare, non falli. Ambros. lib. 6. Epist. 37. ad Chroma. Non posse mori, non in∣firmitatis est sed vir∣tutis. Chrysost. in o∣han. Nihil impoten∣tius quàm hoc posse. Ade hereuto, Theo∣doret. Dial. 3. cap. 4. Impossibilia sunt Omnipotenti Deo,  Sic posse, esse  Na∣zianz. Orat. 36.—, God cannot doe something, even be∣cause he is Omnipotent, as not dye, not sinne, not lye, because such Acts proceed not from power, but from impotencie, and infirmitie. {fleur-de-lys} Theophylact will explaine this Point, in answering this Question, Can God make that which is once done to have beene not done?Theophylact. in Marc. 10. Nuquid autem dicunt Deum factum infectum fa∣cere non posse? Di∣cimus Deum esse ve∣racem: factum au∣tem infectum facere, mendacium est. Quo pacto, quaeso, verax mendacium fecerit? prius enim perderet na∣turam suam: Et ideò qui sic loquuntur, perindè loquuntur, ac si quaeant, Num potest Deus non esse Deus? vides igitur quam ridicula sit quaestio. God is true of his words (saith hee) but to make that not to be done, which hath beene done, is a Lie. How then can hee that is true, Lie? He should sooner lose his Divine na∣ture. They therefore that speake so, talke as if they should aske whether God can be God, whence their question appeareth to bee ridiculous. So he. The ancient Father IustineIusti. Martyr. Quaest Grec. Const. qu. 10.  distin∣guisheth of Impossibilities; One, simple and absolute, which hee calleth  and the other, which hee saith is : giving for his example, in the first Impossi∣bility, a Diameter-line in a Figure to bee equall unto the sides thereof. Of the further judgement of the Fathers hereaf∣ter. {fleur-de-lys} So the Fathers. It is not long since you have beene taught by an exceeding worthy Scholler, that in such Cases as imply Contradiction the ancient Fathers noted the pretence of Gods omnipotencie to have beene ancientlyCasaub. Exert. 3. ad Baron. An 91 Num. 91. Scitu est piorum Patrum: Onipotentiam esse Aslum Haereticorum, quo se recipiant ubi arionibus fuerint victi. Gregor. Nazianz. Orat. 51.

Potentia (inquiunt) Dei hae est, vt falsa sint vera: mendacis est, ut falsum dicat verum, quod Do n competit. The Sanctuary of Heretikes. And they give an instance in the Arians, who denying Christ to have beene God eternall, beleeved him to have beene created God in time; as if it were possible there should be a made God, whose property is to be eternall. Their only pretence was Gods Om∣nipotencie, to make false things true: wherein they proved themselves the greatest Lyars. Take unto you a second Pro∣position.
II. That the Dotrine of the same Impossibiity (by reason of Contradiction) doth magnifie the Power of God, by the Universall consent of Romish Doctors; and their divers Examples of Impossibility, con∣cerning a Body. SECT. III. YOur owne Iesuites doe lay this for a ground:Dicendum, Deum omnia posse facere, quae ullo mo∣do fiant. Omnes Theologi dicunt, De∣um esse omnipoten∣tem, quià potest ad omne, quod non im∣plicat contradictio∣nem, quae ponit esse & non esse simul: & proindè si illud fieret, fieret aliquid, cujus esse esset non esse, &c. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 2. §. Alio igitur. Idem. Adver∣sarij conveniunt in hoc, id non posse fie∣ri, quod implicat con∣tradictionem. Ibid Ipsa contradictio cō sistit in esse, & non esse. Si Deus haberet esse conjunctum cùm non esse, non esset Deu: Si non esset Deus, non esset Om¦nipotens. Quare pos¦se facere quod impli¦cat contradictionem, est Deum posse non esse omnipotentem Malon. Ies. Tom. 1. de. Euch. qu. 1. p. 153. & Perer Ies. in Genae. 7. initio. All Di∣vines affirme (say they) that God is Omnipotent, because he can doe any thing that implyeth not a Contradiction; for that contradi∣ction both affirmeth and denyeth the same thing, making it to be, and not to be that it is. But God, who is Being in himselfe, can∣not make a thing joyntly to be, and not to be. This is a Contradi∣ction, and were not Omnipotencie, but Impotencie; not an effect but a defect. To conclude. Every thing either is, or is not: take away this Principle (say you) and farewell all learning and knowledge. So you, and that, without contradiction, most truly. As your Doctors have taught the truth in Thesi, and Do∣ctrine, so will they manifest the same in Hypothesi, by Exam∣ples of Impossibilities, because of Contradiction: namely, First, that it isI.

Disp. 3. Impossible for God to be contained in one place. Secondly, for a Spirit to bee divided into parts. Thirdly, for Bread to be the Body of Christ, at the same instant when it is Bread. Fourthly, for the same thing to be present together at divers times. Fifty, for one thing to be twice produced in divers places at once. Sixtly, for a Body, having Quantity, not to be able to possesse a place. Seaventhly, It is impossible for Christ his Body, as it is in the Sacrament, to come from one place into another. Eightly, Im∣possible it is to undoe that which is once done; because this were to make that, which is true, to be false. {fleur-de-lys} Ninthly,IX. Scotus, & qui eum sequun∣tur, negant idem corpus posse esse in pluribus locis simul, propter sequens absurdum, quod tunc idem corpus posset esse vivum in uno loco, & mortuum in alio. Inter quos & Ledesma; Id impossibile esse per absolutam Dei potentiam Henricus, & Asiodorensis, propter contradictionem, affirmant. Ibid. cap. 5. X. Minus corpus adaequari majori, Impossibile esse Ibid. cap. 5. XI. Impossibile est idem corpus (quamvis possit esse in pluribus locis quoad extensioe loci) esse tamen eo modo ubiquè, quia non potest hoc modo universum ei adaequari. Vasquez in 3. Thom. qu. 76.  6. Disp. 189. Impossible for the same Body to be at one time alive in one place, and dead in another. Tenthly, Impos∣sible
for a lesse Body to bee equall to a greater. Lastly, Impos∣sible for a Body to be in all places. So your Iesuites, with others. And all these are therefore judged Impossible, Because of Con∣tradiction. Many Scores of the like confessed Impossibili∣ties might bee extracted out of your owne Bookes, who not∣withstanding doubt not to impute Blasphemy to Protestants, for their affirming but of one Contradiction, and consequent∣ly the Impossibilitie of the being of a Body in divers places at once; albeit it will bee found in the after-Discourse to be an Absolute Truth. III. That the Doctrine of Calvin (who is most traduced in this point) accordeth to the former Iudgement of ancient Fathers. SECT IV. IT is no new Calumny, which you have against Calvin, as if he had impugned the Omnipotency of God, in this Question of the Sacrament; which Calvin himselfe did refute in his life∣time, professing, that he is farre from subjecting the power of God to mans reason, or to the order of nature; and beleeving, that even in this Sacrament it exceedeth all naturall principles, that Christ doth feed mens soules with his Blood. But his only Exception is against them, who will impose upon God a power of Contradiction, which is no better than infirmity it selfe.Calumnitur (Westphalus) à No∣bis in dubium voca∣ri Dei omnipotenti∣am—at rerum om∣nium conversionem fieri posse à Christ, nos quo{que} fatemur; verùm inde si quae coelm, conversum esse in terram colti∣gat, ridiculus erit veritatis aestimator. Calv. in Admont.  Westphal.—Rursus. Nos ita addictos ra∣tioni humanae esse jactant, ut nihilo plus tribuamus Dei poten∣tiae quam naturae ordo patitur, & ∣ctat communis sen∣sus. A tam improbis Clumnis provoco ad Doctrinam ipsam, quam tradid, quae satis dilucide often∣dit hoc mysterium minimè rationis mo∣do metiri, nec naturae legibus subijci; ob∣secro an ex Physicis didicimus Christum perinde animas no∣stras ex coelo pascere carne suâ quod naturaliter non fieri omnes dicunt? Dicent; doctrina nostra fidei alis superato mundo, trans∣cendit coelos. Cur (inquiunt) non faciat Deus, ut corpus idem plura, & diversa loca occupet, ut nullo loco contineatur? Infane, qid a Deo postulas, ut carnem faciat non arnem? perinde, ac si instes, ut lucem faciat tenebras—Convertet quidem qundo volet lucem in tenebras, & tenebras in lucem; sed quòd exigis ut lux tenebae sint, & non differant; quid aliud quam ordinem Sapientiae pervertis? & eadem est carnis conditio, ut in uno certo loco sit, & sua dimensione constet. Calv. Instit. lib. 4. c. 17. §. 24. item Beza adversus Hesshufiu. We (saith he) are not so addicted to naturall reason, as to attribute nothing to the power of God, which exceedeth the order of nature, for wee confesse that our soules are fed with the flesh of Christ spiritually above all Physicall or naturall understanding: but that one should bee in divers places at once, and not contained in any, is no lesse Absurdity, than to call light darkenesse. God indeed can, when he will, turne light into darkenesse; but to say light is darke∣nesse, is a perverting of the order of Gods wisedome. So Calvin, and Beza accordingly with him. And so say wee, that it is possible for Christ, (as God) if hee were so pleased, to make of Bread an humane Body, as easily as of stones to raise up Children to Abraham; for there is involved no Contradiction in this. But to make Bread to be flesh, while it is Bread, is a Contradiction in it selfe, and as much as to say Bread is no Bread; and therefore, to the honor of the Omnipotency of Christ, we judge this Saying, properly taken, to be Impossible.
{fleur-de-lys} This Consequence hath beene (as you have heard) the Vniversall Asseveration of your Doctors, to whom, for Con∣clusion sake, Wee will adde the determination of another Ie∣suite; AEgid Coincks Ies de Sacram qu 76 Art. 3. num 50 Sa∣tis est ad hoc osten∣dendum, non ne∣gndum esse, qun Deo sit possibile quivis, modo osten∣damus non psse cō∣trà epertm adferri Contradictionem. It will be sufficient (saith he) for the teaching of Gods Omnipotency that wee deny not but that every thing is possible to him, wherein an evident Contradiction cannot be shewne. So he. In the Interim you may not let slip the Contradiction of your Doctors in this very place, who confessing it to be no impeachment of Gods Omnipotency, to hold Every thing Im∣possible, wherein any Contradiction is implyed; have notwith∣standing inveighed against Calvin and Beza, for denying of a Possibilitie of a Corporall Presence, only because of a Contra∣diction therein. And so, in making others seeme Blasphe∣mous, have shewne themselves slanderous; as wee are now to prove in our confutation of the principall Article of your Romish Church [The Corporall Presence of Christ in the Eu∣charist,] by reason of six more Contradictions involved therein.{fleur-de-lys} CHAP. IV. That the Romish Doctrine of the Corporall Presence of Christ in the Sacrament doth, against that which Christ called [CORPVS MEVM, MY BODY] imply six Contra∣dictions. The first Romish Contradiction, in making it Borne and not borne of a Virgin. SECT. I. THE Catholike Faith hath alwayes taught,20 30 con∣cerning the Body of Christ, That it was borne of the Virgin Mary. Secondly, that this, so borne, was, and is but One. Thirdly, that this One is Finite. Fourthly, that this Finite is Or∣ganicall, and consisting of distinct parts. Fiftly, that this Orga∣nicall is now Perfect, and endued with all Absolutenesse, that ever any humane body can be capable of. Sixtly, that this Perfect is now also Glorious, and no more subject to Vilifi∣cation, or indignitie here on earth. But your now Romish Doctrine, touching Corporall Presence in this Sacrament, doth imply Contradictions, touching each of these, as now wee are to manifest, beginning at the first.
Our Apostolicall Article, concerning the Body of Christ, is expresly this; Hee was borne of the Virgin Mary: which is the ancientest Article of Faith, concerning Christ, that is read of in the Booke of God: The seed of the Woman &c. Genes. 3. to shew that it was by propagation. But your Romane Ar∣ticle, of bringing the Body of Christ into this Sacrament, is, that The substance of Bread is changed into the substance of Christ's Body, which inferreth a Body made of the substance of Bread, as we have alreadySee above Book. 3. Chap. 3. §. 2.  proved, and as all substantiall Conversions doe shew, whether they bee naturall, or miracu∣lous. When the substance of Ayre is naturally changed into the substance of Water, this water is made of Ayre: when the substance of Water was miraculously changed into Wine, the substance of the Wine was produced out of the substance of wa∣ter: when the Body of Lots Wife was turned into a pillar of salt, the substance of that salt was made of the substance of her Bo∣dily flesh. CHALLENGE. DOe you then beleeve your Doctrine of Transubstantiation, that it is the substantiall Change (by the operative words of Consecration) of Bread into a Body, which you call the Body of Christ? then is this Body not borne, but made; nor by Propaga∣tion from the Blessed Virgin, but by Production, and Transub∣stantiation from Bread: which differences, Borne of the Virgin Mary, and not borne of the Virgin Mary, are plainly Contra∣dictory, which was the cause that Augustine (asBartam. de cor∣pore Domini, pag. 61. Ponmus unum te∣stimonium Augusti∣ni, quod dictorum si∣dem nostrorum po∣nat, in sermone ad populum: potest (in∣quit) animo cujuspi∣am cogitatio talis oboriri, Dominus noster Iesus Christus accepit carnem de Virgine Maria, la∣ctarus est Iufans, &c.

Bertram sheweth) distinguished betweene the Body borne of the Virgin, and that which is on the Altar, as betweene Aliud, and Aliud; one, and another thing. And this Argument hath beene forti∣fied Lib. 3. Chap. 3. §. 2. before, and is furthermore confirmed by Saint Augustine Lib. 4. Chap. 7. §. 6. afterwards. {fleur-de-lys} Yet for this present the same Author, out of Saint Ambrose, to the same purposeBertram. ibid ex Ambrosio. Vera utique caro Christi quae crucifixa est, verè ergo carnis illius Sacramentum est. Ipse claat Dominus Iesus; Hoc est corpus meum. Hinc Bertram.

Quod verò nunc agitur in Ecclesia mysterium, verè illius carnis, in quae crucidixus est diceret esse Sacramentum. observeth a distinction used by that Father, betweene The Flesh of Christ crucified (and therfore Borne of the Virgin) and the Sacrament of Christs Body, whereof Christ sayd [This is my Body.]
CHAP. V. The second Romish Contradiction, to the overthrowing of that which Christ called [MY BODIE:] by making one Body of Christ, not One, but Many. SECT. I. YOur Profession standeth thus:Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. The Body of Christ, albeit now in Heaven, yet is (say you) substantially in many places here on earth, even whersoever the Hoast is Consecrated. So you. Next your MasterMr. Brerely in his Booke of the Li¦turgie of the Masse, pag. 150. Because Calvin Institut. 4. cap. 17. §. 10. saith: Etsi incredibile vide∣tur, ut in tanta loco∣rum distantia pene∣trare ad nos possit Christi caro, ut sit nobis in cibum, &c. Brerely laboureth earnestly to draw Calvin to professe a Possibility of Christ's Bodily Presence in divers places at once, contrary to M. Calvins plaine and expresse profession in the same Chapter; where he directly confuteth this Romish Doctrine of Madnesse, saying thus:The same Calvin in the same Chap 17. §. 24.

To seeke, that Christ his Body should be in many places at once, is no lesse madnesse than to require, that God should make his Body to be flesh, and not to be flesh at one time; whereas not Aristotle, but the Spirit of God (saith he) hath taught us, that this his Body is to bee contained in Heaven untill the last day. Afterwards Calvin, inveigheth against the folly of your Church, which will not acknowledge any presence of Christ in this Sacrament, except it bee locall on earth, As if (saith hee) shee would pull Christ out of his Sanctuary of Heaven. And at last, after that he had said,As for the obje∣cted sentence he expli∣cateth himself, §. 32. Christus illis presens non est, nisi ad nos descendat, qusi verò si nos ad se evehat, non aequè ejus poti∣amur praesentiâ. E §. 36. Vt Christum illie ritè apprehen∣dant, piae animae in coelum erigantur ne∣celle est. [As untruly also doth hee allege Bucer, Beza, and Farel. pag. 237. who had the same sense with Carvin. Mr. Foxe sayd, that Christ if hee list might be on earth, but he sayd not so of and in the same time.] Christ his Body is united to the Soule of the Communicant, hee so explaineth himselfe, that hee meant a spirituall Vnion: so that it doth ful∣ly appeare, that Master Brerely in this point (as usually in many others) allegeth Calvins testimony, against Calvins sense, and his owne conscience. It is irkesome to see the fury, wherewith your Disputers are carried against Protestants, amongst whom wee see againe your MasterSee in the former Allegition. Brerely imposing upon Beza the same opinion of the Presence of Christ's Body in Heaven, and on Earth at one time. Although, notwithstanding,Firi posse, ut Christi corpus possit esse in pluibus locis simul, praetr hunc Apostatum nemo inficiatus est, quod cum credere nluit, tollit ab omnipotenti virtute. Salmer. Ies. tom. 9. tract. 23. p. 173. your Iesuite Salmeron as bitterly taxeth Beza, for contrarily holding it Impossible for one Body to be in two places at once; whom therefore he calleth an Apostata: and whomBeza cum Adversarijs congressus, ubi Calvini mysteria non posset defendere, in eam prorupit Blasphemiam, ut Deum neget omnipotentem: disertè enim scribit, Deum non posse officere, ut Corpus aliquod, manente sub∣stantiâ, sit abs{que} loco, vel in pluribus locis simul; Illud enim Angeli axioma [apud Deum nihil est impossibile] non sine ex pione accipiendum esse, quod factum fieri nequit infectum—O argutos Philosophos! qui Dei Majestatem ad suas Physicas regulas non erubscunt revocare. Frateol. Elench. Haeres. lib. 2. Tit. Bezanitae. another termeth, for the same
cause, Blasphemous, as if this were indeed to deny the Omni∣potencie of God. Whereas, according to our former Propositi∣on, it is rather to defend it, because God is the God of Truth (which is but one) and truth is without that Contradiction, which is necessarily implyed in your Doctrine of the Locall presence of any one Body in many places at once, as in the next place is to be evinced. That the same Second Romish Contradiction, holding the Pre∣sence of one Body in many places at once, is proved, by the nature of Being in distinct places at one time, to be a making One, not One. SECT. II. IN the first place hearken to your Aquinas, (the chiefest Do∣ctor, that ever possessed the Romish Schoole)Catholici isti cum Thoma in quar∣tum distinct. 14. art. 2. hanc rationem, cut non possit corpus Christi localiter esse, &c.—Quod si verò non postic corpus Christi localiter esse in diversis locis, quà divideretur à seipso, profectò nec possit Sacramentaliter esse eadem ratione: qui licet dicat hoc non esse per loci occupa∣tionem, tamen dicit, per realem & veram praesentiam in plari∣ribus Hostijs, sive Al∣taribus: quae realis praesentia in tot Al∣taribus, & non loc intermedijs, non mi∣nùs tollere videretur indivisionem rei. Bel. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. pag. 491. Quidam Catholici, atque in eis Sanctus Thomas, existimant non posse unum corpus esse si∣mul in diversis locis localiter; quià (m∣quiunt) unum est il∣ld, quod indivisum  quocunque alio. Bellar. quò suprà. it is not pos∣sible by any Miracle, that the Body of Christ be locally in many places at once, because it includeth a Contradictio, by making it not one; for one is that, which is not divided from it selfe. So hee, together with others, whom you call Catholikes, who conclude it Impossible for the Body of Christ to be locally in divers places at once: {fleur-de-lys} Besides that his other Sentence wherein hee holdeth thisAquin. in Supplem. in 3. part. qu. 83. Art. 3. ad 4. Dicendum quod corpus Christi localiter in diversis locis non potest fieri der miraculum—quia esse in pluribus locis simul, repugnat individuo, ratione ejus, quod est En individuum in se—& includit Contradictionem, sicut quòd Homo careat ratione. Et qu. 8. Art. 2. ad 1. Corpus non potest actu esse in pluribus locis simul, hoc enim est solius Dei. Possibility, as proper only to God. Which though hee speake concerning the locall maner of Being; yet his Reason (asSee the former testimony. your Cardinall confesseth) doth as well concerne your Sacramentall maner of being on earth, to deny the Body of Christ to be really in many Hoasts, and on many Altars at once. And Aquinas his reason being this, [Vnum] One (saith he) is that, which is not divided from it selfe: but, to be in divers places at once, doth divide one from it selfe, and consequently maketh it not to be One: which being a Contradiction, doth inferre an Impossbility. So hee. {fleur-de-lys} Accordingly your Iesuite Conincks;AEgid Conincks Ies. de Sacram. qu. 75. Art. 4. Dub. 3. Thomas in 4. Dist. 44. qu. 2. Art.  ait, Per miraculum fieri non posse, ut corpus sit simul in duobus locis, sc. modo quantirativo. [Quià esse in plu∣ribus locis repugnat Individuo, ratione ejus quod est esse indivisum per sc.] Sanè haec ratio si absolutè, n sonat, intelligatur, corpus Christi non potest esse simul in coelo, & in hoc Sacramento. If, as Thomas saith, (saith he) a Body cannot be in two places at once Quanti∣taetively, no not by any Miracle of God, because the thing should so be divided from it selfe: then (the words being taken as they sound) cannot Christ's Body be at once locally in heaven, and on earth in this Sacrament. So he. Thus is the maine Article of your Romish Faith, concerning the Corporall Presence of Christ in many places at once, wholly overthrowne by
the judgement of Thomas Aquinas, the Oracle of your Romish Shooles. But when as Protestants argue accordingly, as you have done, your Ies.Vasquez Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 189 Cap 7. Ratio, quae ab Haereticis affertur, est, Corpus idem, si in diversis locis col∣locetur, esse divisum à se. Vasquez spareth not to call it the Rea∣son of Heretikes. Which bewrayeth the distorted and squint∣eyed sight of our Romish Adversaries, who knowing the same Argument to be used by your owne Aquinas, as well as by Protestants, do notwithstanding honor the one with the Title of Angelicall, and upbraid the other with the black marke of Hereticall. Earnestly have wee sought for some Answer to this insolu∣ble Argument, as wee thinke: and your greatest Doctor hath nothing to say, but that theDuplex est di∣visio, una intrinseca, in se, altera extrin∣seca, & accidentalis in respectu loci. Ita{que} cum corpus est in di∣versis locis, non tol∣litur indivisio in se, sed extrinseca, in re∣spectu loci, ut cùm Deus sit unus, est in diversis locis, & ani∣ma rationalis est in diversis partibus cor∣poris una. Bellar. ibid. Being in a place is not the essen∣tiall property of a thing, and therefore can be no more said to di∣vide the Body from it selfe, than it can be said to divide God, who is every where, or the soule of man, which is one in every part, or member of the Body. So he. Wee throughout this whole Tractate, wherein wee dispute of the Existence of a Body in a Place, do not tye our selves every where to the precise Accep∣tion of place, as it is defined to be Superficies, &c. but as it sig∣nifieth one space or distinct Vbi, from another, which wee call here and there. We returne to your Cardinals Answer. CHALLENGE. AN answer you have heard from your Cardinall, unworthy any man of Iudgement, because of a Triple falsity there∣in. First in the Antecedent, and Assertion, saying that Being in a Place or space is not inseparable from a Body. Secondly, in the Ground of that, because Place is not of the Essence of a Body. Thirdly, in his Instances, which hee insisteth upon (for Ex∣ample-sake) which are both Heterogenies. Contrary to this Assertion, wee have already proved the necessity of the Locall Being of a Body, wheresoever it is; and now wee confirme it, by the Assertion of One, than whom the latter Age of the World hath not acknowledged any more accurate, and accom∣plished with Philosophicall learning; evenSi dicas, corpus est hîc, & ibi idem, ipsum quidem distra∣has in diversa: prin∣cipio ptimo per se, & immediato prohibe∣tur corpus esse in plu∣ribus ubi: est autem continuitas affectus consequens immedi∣ate unitatem; Con∣tradictiones enim sunt. Iulius Scalliger Exercit. 5. quaest. 6. [For how can there hee. Continuity in that 5. the Termii whereof are separa¦ted by divers places?] Iulius Scaliger by name, (a Professed Romanist) who hath concluded, as a Principle infallible, that Continuity being an immediate affection and property of Vnity, One Body cannot be said to be in two places, as here, and there, without dividing it selfe from it selfe. So hee. Certainly, because Place being the Terminus (to wit that, which doth confine the Body that is in it) it is no more possible for the Body to be in many places at once, than it is for an Vnity to be a multitude, or many. Which truth, if that you should need any further proofe, may seeme to be confirmed in this, that your Disputers are driven to so miserable Straits, as that
they are not able to instance in any one thing in the world to exemplifie a Possibility of the being of a Body in divers places at once, but onely Man's soule, which is a spirit; and God himselfe, the Spirit of Spirits, of both whichSee below Ch . §. 2. &  §. 2. hereaf∣ter. Onely you are to observe, that the Cardinals Argument, in proving Space to be separable from a Body, because it is not of the Essence of a Body, is, in it selfe, a Non sequitur, as may ap∣peare in the Adjunct of Time: which although it be not of the Essence of any thing, yet is it impossible for any thing to be without Time, or yet to be in two different Times together. {fleur-de-lys}And for the better discovery of the weakenesse of this their common Objection, Wee adde, that although [Vbi,] Place, or Space be not of the essence of a Body, to constitute it one, yet may it be sufficient to demonstrate it to be but one Body, because of Contradiction; as well as all proper , or properties, as Risibility in a man; or else as Quantity to a Body, and Circumscription to Quantity; which although they be after their Substances in nature, yet are they joyntly and inseparably with them in Times. But that wee may argue from the very termes of Contradiction. Your asserting the same Body of Christ to be Locall, according to the dimensions of Place; and not Locall, according to the dimensions of Place, at one time, implies a Contradiction. But you teach the same Body of Christ to be at once (as n heaven) Locall, according to the dimensions of Place; and (as on the Altar) not Locall, according to the dimensions of Place. Ther∣fore is your Romish Doctrine Contradictorie to it selfe. Yet shall wee be content that you may call this a Sophisticall Ar∣gument, except the Ancient Fathers shall establish the same Conclusion. For this present take unto you a Reason, as wee think, Impregnable. Nothing can possibly be Extrà se, with∣out it selfe; but for a Body, being heere, to be at the same time separated from Heere, by a Space where it is not, as on this Altar, and on the other Altar, and yet not to be in the Space betweene, is to be without it selfe; and Consequently divideth it selfe from it selfe; which no man will affirme, that is not beside himselfe. The same Second Romish Contradiction manifested in Scrip∣ture, by an Argument Angelicall. SECT. III. MAtth. 28. 6. The Angell speaking to the woman that sought Christ in the grave, said; Hee is not heere, for he is risen, and gone into Galilee: which is as much, as to have said, hee could not be in Both places at once; an Argument Angeli∣call.
But you Answer that it was spoken Morally. How? (wee beseech you) as if one should say (saith yourLoquitur ad mentem sanctarum illarum mulierum—Sed optima est solu∣tio, moraliter intel ligi, ut si quis dicat, talis homo non sedet ad mensam, coenatus est enim. Bellar. li. 3. de Eu h. c. 4. Cardinall) Such a man sitteth not at table, for he hath supped. What fond trifling is this, and wilfull perverting the Truth of God? for this your Argument, A man sitteth not at table, for hee hath supped, is scarce a probable Consequence, that a man is risen from the table, as soone as hee hath supped. Contrarily, the Angel's Logike is not by a Peradventure, but necessary; not imaginary, but historicall; not conjecturall, but dogmaticall, and Demon∣strative. {fleur-de-lys}And so SaintChrysost. [Ve∣nite & inspicite ubi positus erat]  upon the words of the Evange∣list. {fleur-de-lys}Chrysostome doth call it. For better explanation whereof, wee may turne the Causall word [FOR] into an Illative [THEREFORE, ] because it is all one (as you know) to say hee is not here in the Grave [For hee is ri∣sen out of the Grave; And to say, Hee is risen out of the Grave, [Therefore] hee is not heere in the Grave. Vnderstand then, first, that the matter subject of this Argu∣ment being no morall arbritrary Act of man's will; but the omnipotent Resurrection of Christ from the dead, (which is a fundamentall Article of Christian Faith, yea, and as it were the foundation of all other Articles, without which, as the Apostle saith,1 Cor. 15. 14. Our Faith were vaine) the Angell must neces∣sarily be thought to have concluded dogmatically; which is the reason that he is so instant, and so urgent, saying to the woman, Come, and see the place, where the Lord was laid. Which hee ad∣deth (saith yourVideli. ad Comprobandum di∣ctum. [Non est hîc.] Salmer. Ies. Tom. 11. Tract. 9. pag. 72. Iesuite) for confirmation of that, which hee had said, [Hee is not heere.] & Seeking by their sight (saith also ano∣ther Maldonat. Ies. in eum locum. Nunc experientia confir∣mat, & ipso visu ni¦titur fidem facere. Iesuite) to make them believe. {fleur-de-lys}And as much as if hee had said, (saithQuasi dicat, si verbo non credatis, vacuo sepulchro cre∣datis. Anselm. Anselme) If you believe not my word, give credit to the emptie Sepulchre, in satisfying your owne sight. Therefore was it demonstrative. And againe, the Angell put∣ting them to make use both of his Saving, and their owne See∣ing; Go yee (saith hee) and tell his Disciples: And they went (saith the Text) to bring his Disciples word. Therefore was his Argument Doctrinall, such whereby he thought so fully to per∣swade them, that they might informe others in an Infallible Truth. {fleur-de-lys}One of your Doctors of Lovain published a Booke intituled, A Confutation of Cavillations, wherein hee Marcus Con∣stant. Theol. Lovan. lib. qui inscribitur; Confutatio Cavilla∣tionum, quibus Sa∣cramentum Euh im∣peti solet. Ad ob. 6.

Arundimea sunt haec, & flaccida tela, quae librata non pertingant quo in∣tenduntur. propoundeth the Argument of Protestants, as if it stood simply thus: The Angell sayd of Christ, now risen out of the grave, Hee is risen, hee is not heere: Therefore hee cannot be heere. And thereupon calleth them Absurd: when-as they argue from the Angels owne Logicall terme, [For] in the Text, Matth. 28. 6. Hee is not heere, [For] hee is risen. Implying the Consequence, which you have heard, that he could not be both Risen out of the Grave, and In the Grave, at the same time of the Angels speech. But the Causall
word, [For] your Doctor omitted quite, that hee might more easily impose upon them an Absurdity of his owne de∣vising. Thus have you beene confuted by an Argument both Angelicall and Evangelicall.{fleur-de-lys} That the Romish Objection out of that Scripture, Act. 9. is frivolous. SECT. IV. CHrist (Act. 9.) appeared to Saint Paul, then Saul, when hee was in his way to Damascus, &c. whence your Cardi∣nall Simul in summo , & in ēre vieu terrae. Bellarll. 3. de Ech. c. 3. §. Secundum, &c. laboureth to prove a double presence of Christ, at one instant, (to wit) in Heaven with the Saints, and in the Ayre unto Saul. First, because the light in the Ayre Strucke Saul blinde. Secondly, because others in the company of Saul heard not the same voice of Christ, which hee heard. Thirdly, because Saul asked saying; Lord, who art thou? and heard, and under∣stood the voice. Fourthly, Because Saul was thereby made a witnesse of seeing Christ risen from the dead. And therefore (saith hee) was this Apparition in the Ayre. Every objection may receive it's opposition. To the first, thus: Did none of you ever know a mans eyes so dazled with the brightnesse of the Sun-beames on earth, that hee could not see for a while; and yet did not the Sun remove any whit from his Sphere? So might the glorious shine of the person of Christ in Heaven worke up∣on Saul on earth. To the second, thus: Have you not read of a voice from Heaven, Iohn 12. 29. which some heard articulately, and said, An Angell speaketh, and the common people said, It thundreth? because (as yourTolet. Ies. in cum locum. Iesuit confesseth) they heard it but confusedly. To the third, thus: Men heare, and heare not, so farre as God is pleased to reveale, or not to reveale himselfe, or his word, and voyce, yea or any sight unto them; for Saint Stephen saw the Heavens opened, and Majesty of Christ, when others wanted that sight. To the fourth, thus: The eyes of Saul beholding Christ in Heaven might be as good witnesses of Christ his Resurrection, as were the eyes of Saint Stephen, Acts 7. who saw him; and so much more, because he was both made blinde by the brightnes of that sight of Christ, and after healed in the Name of Christ. If any desire to know the judgement of ancient Fathers, in this Case, your Cardinall leaveth him to seeke it where he shall please. Sure we are thatAug. in Psal. 54. & Tract. 1 in Iob.

conceiving any inferiour heaven, may catch at the Moone; you may observe that the Fathers understood that Heaven, wherein Christ is sayd to sit at the right hand of God; and that, whereby the Doctrine of Christ is intituled Celestiall, and Heavenly. {fleur-de-lys}And if all this were true that hath beene objected, that Christ appeared in the Ayre, yet is your Conse∣quence but lame, that therefore he was bodily also in Heaven, if wee may beleeve your Iesuite Lorinus:Potuit tantis∣per de coelo descen∣disse. Lorin. Ies. in Act. 9. {fleur-de-lys}And Pe∣lufiota already, at the letter Because Christ (saith he) might for so short a time have descended from Heaven. By all which you may perceive, that your Cardinall, for all his arguing about the Ayre, hath beene (as the Proverbe is) but Beating the Ayre. {fleur-de-lys}And lest that any of you might Object that of Acts 23. ver. 11.

Not daring (as hee saith of himselfe) to affirme all such like Apparitions to have beene immediately by Christ himselfe, will have you to know that they might have beene performed by some Angell, in the person of Christ.{fleur-de-lys} And as lanke and frivolous is his Confirmation of their As∣sertion by (as he saith) Apparitions of Christ unto divers here on earth, when as yet hee was certainly in Heaven: for it is not cer∣taine, that he appeared personally to any here on earth, if the position of your Angelicall Doctor Aquinas may stand for good, who held itSee above, c. 2. §. 3. Impossible for Christ to appeare here on earth, in his proper shape, in two places at once: which sheweth that these Apparitions of Christ were rather onely Visions, without any personall appearing. We are not ignorant how much you attribute to your Cardinall Bellarmine, whom you have heard contending so urgently for proofe of the visible Presence of Christ in divers places at once; and what like Esteeme you have of your great Professor Suarez, who now cometh Concluding as followeth.Concludo, Christi corpus tan∣tùm esse in coelo & in Eucharistia; se∣clusoque eodem. Eu∣charistiae mysterio, non solùm non esset corpus ubique, s neque etiam esset a∣licubi, nisi in coelo: & contrarium asse∣rer esset magna re∣me as sine fundamento, & contra omnes Theologos. Suarez.

So hee. Wee leave these your two most emi∣nent Doctors of the Chaire, and both of the same Society of the Iesuites, the one for Rome, the other for Spaine, in this their Contradiction, that wee may consult with Antiquitie it selfe.

Vasquez (ver∣batim) in each one, Concluding that None of them do prove such an Existence, by extension of parts, in respect of Place. Which being joyned with the former Confession of Suarez, (already cited) affirming it to be a Doctrine Contrary to all Divines, to teach the Body of Christ to be any where, but on∣ly in heaven, excepting the mysterie of the Eucharist; It will be easie to discerne how little credit is to be given to the Sto∣ries, which are alleged by Bellarmine of bodily Apparitions without the Sacrament.{fleur-de-lys} That the Opinion of the Being of a Body, in many places at once, implyeth a Contradiction, is Secondly proved by the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers, thereby distinguishing Christ his two Natures, Godhead and Manhood, one from another, by Circumscription and Incircumscription. SECT. V. ANcient Fathers judged it Impossible for a Body to be with∣out Determination in one only place at one time: yea (say you) they did so, but meaning Impossible, according to the course of nature, but not absolutely Impossible, as if by Divine Miracle a Body might not be in many places at once. This is your onely Answer, and the Answer of every one of your An∣swerers, whereat wee should wonder, but that they have given us so often experience, what little conscience they make, how true their Answers be, so that they may be knowne to have
answered: otherwise they well know that the Fathers meant an absolute Impossibility; and that this is most evident by the He∣resie which they did impugne, and also by their maner of con∣futing the same. The Eutychian Heretikes (youAlfons. de Cast. cont. haeres Eutych. know) confounded the Pro∣perties of Christs humane nature with his Godhead, pretending (as you do) the Omnipotencie of Christ, for the patronizing of their Heresie, As thinking thereby (thus saithTheod. Dial. 2. Dicunt Christi car∣nem spiritualem, & alterius substantiae quàm sit nostra caro: imaginantur se per haec Deum magnifa∣cere, cum tamen falsi veritatem accusant. Theodoret, out of Amphilochius) to magnifie the Lord Christ: whereas this was indeed (as the same Father saith) to accuse Truth of falshood. You may heare the same voice sound out of the Romane Chaire. PopeLeo Papa. Ep. 13. quae est ad Pulcher. Aug. Subrepsisse in∣telligo spiritum falsi∣tatis, ut dum affirmat se religiosiùs de filij Dei majestate senti∣re, si ei naturae no∣strae veritatem inesse non dicat, &c. Leo speaking of Eutyches, the Author of that Heresie, saith that Hee affirmed, that thereby he did more religiously con∣ceive of the Majesty of Christ, by denying his humane nature; whom therefore that holy Pope censureth to have beene seduced by the Spirit of falsity. Therfore it cannot be but that the Fathers, in confuting an Heresie founded upon a pretence of Omnipotency, did hold that doctrine absolutely impossible, which they with∣stood, as will now more lively appeare by the Testimonies of themselves. Theodoret against this Heretike argueth thus:Theod. Dial. 3. lib. 3. ex Euseb Emis. (Contra eos qui di∣cunt Corpus Christi in Divinitate muta∣tum esse post resurre∣ctionem) Hos dice∣re necesse est vel di¦vinae naturae manus & pedes, & alias cor∣poris partes tributas esse, vel fateri corpus manfisse in suae na∣turae finibus. Atqui divina natura sim∣plex est & incompo∣sita, corpus autem compositum, & in multas partes divi∣sum: non est ergo mutatum in naturam divinitatis, & qui∣dem immortale a∣ctum, & divinà natu¦râ plenum: sed ta¦men corpus, quod propriam habet C∣cumscriptionem. The Body of Christ, being a compounded thing, cannot be changed into a divine nature, because it hath Circumscription.

Theodoret himselfe doth furthermore make good, who in the same Dialogue, where (to the Heretikes Objection out of Iob, saying, I know thou canst doe all things, nothing is impossible with thee) he answe∣reth, by instancing in examples of Impossibility, because of Contradiction, saying; It is impossible for eternity to be in time, or a thing created to be uncreated: or finite to be infi∣nite. So he.{fleur-de-lys} Vizil. lib. 4 cont. Eutych. Circumscribitur loco per naturam carnis suae, & loco non capitur per nturam divinitatis suae, Haec fides est confessio Catholica, quam Apostoli tradiderunt, Martyres roboraverunt, & fideles nunc usque custodiunt. Et paulò superius. Quia nunc in Coelo est, non est utique in terra. Vigilius (anciently Bishop of Trent) might have read a Lesson to the late Bishops at Trent, who against the same Here∣tike, distinguishing the two natures of Christ, his Humane na∣ture, by being Circumscribed in one place; the Divine, by being unlocable, doubted not to inferre, saying of his Bodily nature; It being now in heaven is not at all on earth. And, lest that any might thinke this was but his owne private opinion, hee aver∣reth saying; This is the Catholike profession taught by the Apostles, confirmed by Martyrs, and hitherto held of the Faithfull. So Ful∣gentius upon the same Distinction maketh the same Conclusion,
saying of his Bodily substance, that thereforeFulgent. de per∣sona Christi ad Trasi∣mund lib. 2. cap 5. Vnus idemque homo localis ex homne; qui est Deus immen∣sus ex Patie. Vnus idemque secundùm humanm substanti∣am absens caelo, cum esset in terra; & de∣relinquens terram, cùm ascendisset in coelum. Being on Earth, it was absent from Heaven; and going to Heaven, it left the Earth. Damascea had to deale with the forenamed Heretike, and professing to deliver the substantiall difference of both Na∣tures, hee differenceth them by these contrary Characters, Damascen. de fide Orthodoxi, lib 3. cap. 3. Erum natu∣rarum,  astumus sal∣vari: nam ceatum mansit creatum; in∣creat, increatum: morrale manebt mortale; immortale, immortale:  {fleur-de-lys} Paulo su∣erius . Created, not Created; Capable of mortalitie, and not Capa∣ble of mortalitie; Circumscribed, and not Circumscribed; and Invisible in it selfe, and Visible: which notwithstanding is, in the Eucharist, by your doctrine, no Capable of Circumscription, because whole in the whole Hoast, and in every part thereof, and to the very Angels of God Invisible. {fleur-de-lys}And yet againe, that you may further know that Da∣miscen is as professedly ours, in this point, as any Protestant can be; hee, in confutation of the same Heretike, addeth saying; How can one and the same Nature be capable at once of two essentiall contrary Differences? for how is it possible for the same Nature, according to the same, to be created, and un∣created mortall, and immorall; circumscribed, and uncir∣cumscribed? Where, by the way, you may observe, that Circumscription of a Body is accounted by Damascen to be [ that is] Essentiall to a Body. In like maner Ephrae∣mius (in Photus) sticketh to the same Argument of diffe∣rence of natures, by reason of Contradiction, saying con∣cerning the two distinct natures of Christ? That none that hath wit can say, that the same Nature is both palpable and impalpable; visible and Invisible. {fleur-de-lys} Let us ascend hither to the more primitive Ages, to inquire of Fathers, who had conflict; also with Heretikes, who gaine∣said the Truth of either Nature. Athanasius urged Christ his Ascension into Heaven,  prove that hee was as truly man, as God, because his God head was never out of Heaven, being Athanas. . 2. Adversus eos q. trul∣lum nos miraculum , eo quod carem negant: — Vndrminate in place, and uncircumscribed; even then, when it was Hyphstatically united with the Body, being on earth. Therefore it was his Body that ascended into Heaven from Earth. His Argument is taken from Circumscription; even as INazian Epist. 1. id Cled Hominem &  . Nazianzen also doth Characterize them. Cyril of Alaxandria is a Father, whose Patronage your Dis∣puters would be thought often to rely upon; hee is now about to deliver his Iudgement so freely and plainly, as if hee had meant to stop the mouthes of all our Opposies in the same An∣swer, which hee maketh against certaine Heretikes, who held that God's nature is a Substance, which can received vision and partition. If God (saithCyril. Alex, Tom. 2. lib. de T. i∣nir Si verè S cho∣hem & Partitionem, Divini natur, (ut  dicunt) reciperet, & intelligeretur, ut corpus: si autem hoc, & in loco omnò & li quanta facta esset, non effugeret Circumscrip fol. 89. Cyril) should be divisible, as a Body, then should it be contained in place, and then should it have Quan∣tity, and having Quantity it could not but be Circumscribed.
Will you now say (which hitherto hath beene your onely An∣swer to other Fathers) that Cyril meant not that it was absolute∣ly Impossible, that Quantity should be without Circumscription, but onely according to the Course of nature? then might the Heretikes, whom Cyril confuted, have made the same Answer, and consequently Cyril's Consequence, and Confutation (toge∣ther with the Arguments of the Fathers above-mentioned) had beene of no force. What shall wee say? must still the ancient Fathers be made no better than Asses, in arguing, that your Ro∣mish Masters (forsooth) may be deemed the onely Doctors, even then, when they prepare the same Evasion for Heretikes, which they devise for themselves? but you must pardon us, if wee believe that Cyril (seeing he durst say, that God himselfe, if hee were a Body, must be in a place, as a thing having Quan∣tity, and Circumscribed) would have abhorred your now Romish Faith of believingSee hereafter, Chap. 3. Sect. 3. Christ's Body consisting of Quantitie, albeit not Circumscribed in place. {fleur-de-lys}The Arguments, which wee receive from these Fathers, in Confutation of your Romish Faith, of believing the same Humane Body of Christ, Circumscribed in Heaven, and Vncir∣cumscribed on your Altars on Earth; are Two. The first is their denying the Possibility of Christ's Body to be Vncir∣cumscribed, and that upon two grounds: One, because Cir∣cumscription is Essentiall, and as Proper to Christ's Body, as Vncircumscription is Proper to his Divine Nature; with∣out which Difference there should follow a Confusion of his two Different natures, which was the very same Heresie which they impugned. Their second ground is from the infallible Rule of Contradiction, being the extremest De∣gree of Impossibilitie that can be imagined; namely, For the same ody to be, at the same time, mortall, and immor∣tall; palpable, and impalpable. And yet your Fathers of the Councell of Trent, in their wisedomes, have Canonized it for an Article of your Faith, by teaching a palpable, and Cir∣cumscriptive Body of Christ in Heaven, and impalpable, and Vn∣circumscriptive on Earth. It might be held a kind of Impiety not to consult with Saint Augustine, in a Question of this moment. The Iudgement of Saint Augustine, stiled by learned Do∣ctors, The Mallet of Heretikes, to knocke out their Braines. First, giving this Caution, viz.Aug. Epist. 57. ad Dardan: where af∣ter this Coveat, [Ca∣vendum ne ità Divi∣nitatem affirmamus, ut corporis veritatem auferamus:] hee hath these words. Spatia locotum tolle corpo∣tibus, & nusquā erunt; & quià nusquam erunt, nec erunt. Idem. Tract. 31. in toh. Homo secundùm corpus in loco est, & de loco migrat, & cum ad alium locum venerit, in eo loco, unde venit, non est: Deus autem implet omnia; ubi{que} totus, nec secundùm spatia tenetur locis; erat tamen Christus secundùm visibilem carnem i terra, secundùm invisibilem majestatem in coelo, & in terra. To take heed lest wee s establish Christs Deity, that wee destroy not the truth of his Bo∣dy;
Hee afterwards concludeth against the Impossibilitie of a Body uncircumscribed, saying, Take away Space of Place from Bodies, and then shall they be no-where; and if they be no-where, then must they be no-what, having no Being at all. Secondly, where hee concludeth, that Christ, according to his Visible flesh, was on earth, when according to his Invisible Majesty, Hee was both in Heaven and Earth; hee layd this Ground thereof, to wit, that A Body removing from one place to another, is not in that place from whence it came. But our Catholike Article of Faith saith, that [Hee ascended from Earth to Heaven:] And therefore by Saint Augustine his Ar∣gument, Hee was not then on Earth. In the third place, Discussing the Difference of the two Natures of Christ more fully, in respect of Presence in Place, for the reconciling of a Seeming Contradiction of Christs words, saying in one place, [I am with you unto the Ends of the World,] and an∣other place saying, [You shall not have me alwayes with you,] he assoyleth the Difficultie, by Differencing Christs Natures. Aug. Tract. 50. in oh. [Pauperes semper habebitis vo∣biscū, me autem non semper habebitis] Potest sic intelligi▪—Accipiant & hoc bo∣ni, sed non sint soli∣citi, loquebatur emi de praesentia corpo∣s sui. Nam secundū majestatem suam, se∣cundùm providenu∣am, secundùm inessa∣bilem, & invisibilem gratiam impletur ab eo quod dctum est; [Ecce ego vobiscum sum usquè ad con∣summationem secu∣li:] secundùm autem d quod de Virgine natus est, quod{que} in Resurrectione mani∣estatus est, non sem∣per habebitis vobis∣cum. Quare? Quo∣nim conversatus se∣cund corporis pae∣sentiam quadraginta diebus cum discipuli suis, & eis videntibus ascendit in coesum, & non est hîc. Ibi est enim, sedet ad dex∣trim Patris: & hic est, non enim reces∣▪ praesentia majesta∣tis. Secundùm prae∣sentiam carnis. Ec. le∣sia modo side ten, oculis non videt. In that Christ sayd (saith hee) [You shall not have mee alwayes with you, ] hee spake it of the Presence of his Body; But in saying, [I am with you untill the Consummation of the World,] hee spake it of his (Divine) Majesty, Providence, and Invisible grace. But according to that (nature) which was borne of the Virgin, and after was manifested in the Resurrection, [You shall not have me alwayes with you.] So hee. Your sole Answer, in the Iudgement of your choycest Divines, delivered by your Cardinall, is this;Bellarm. l. 1. de Euchdr. cap. 14. §. Denique—Augusti∣nus intelligit corporis Christi praesentiam visibilem, more hu∣mano inter homines conversantis: atquè ita se explicat Quare? quia conversatus est secundùm corporis praesentiam quadra∣ginta dies, ipsis vi∣denibus, modo si∣de renet, oulis non videt. that S. Augustine [in denying that Christ is alwayes with us, accor∣ding to the presence of his Bodie] understood a visible presence thereof, after an humane Conversation with men: which hee collecteth from that which followeth in the speech of Saint Augustine, That Christ was seene of the Apostles in his Bodily presence after his Resurrection, and as his Assension: But now (saith S. Augustine) Wee see him by Faith, and not with our eyes. So your Cardinall. Which is as raw and extravagant a Collection, and repugnant to the meaning of Saint Augu∣stine, as can be. Because the whole scope of Saint Augustine is to shew the Excellency of Christs Divine Nature, in re∣spect of the Humane, in regard of Presence it selfe, and not in respect of visibilitie, or any maner of Presence; Because the Divine nature, by it's Omnipresency, is alwayes with us, but the other, which was seene after his Visible Conver∣sation upon Earth, was seene to ascend into Heaven. Hee inforceth directly from hence, therefore It is not here on Earth, (Thus;) It ascended into Heaven, and is not here, for hee there sitteth at the right hand of God. But as for the Pre∣sence of his Majesty (which signifieth his Deity) It is here
(saith Saint Augustine) and not departed from us: which is a manifest Distinguishing of the Deity, and Humanity of Christ, meerely, in respect of, Hic est, & Non hic est, that is, Presence of the one, and Not-Presence of the other. As also betweene, Recessit, & Non-Recessit, in like Diffe∣rence; whereas if according to the Popish Faith, the Di∣stinction held onely in respect of the Visibilitie, or Invisibi∣litie of Presence, (you alwayes teaching that Christs Body is substantially Present on Earth, Invisibly in the Eucharist) then (in respect of the maner of Presence byBecause Saint Aug. calleth the pre∣sence of his majestie and grace, Invisible. re the Testimony a∣bove cited. Invisibilitie) there should be no Prerogative of Difference betweene Chists Divine, and Bodily Being on Earth; against the Conclusive Determination of Saint Augustine in this place▪ Which is also confirmed, by that which is further objected in opposition against us, out of the last words of Saint Au∣gustine: The Church (saith hee) Seeth not him with her eyes▪ but holdeth him by Faith; namely by believing the Presence of his Body; But where? to wit, Sitting at the right hand of God (saith hee;) but not in the Pix, or on the Altar. The next Testimony of this Father may be that his Malling and braining of the Hereticall Manichees, who held a Bodily Presence of Christ, both in the Sunne and Moone at once; He making a flat Contrary Conclusion: (Aug. contra Faust Manich. l. 20. cap. 11. Secundum praesentiam spiritua∣sem nullo modo  pari posset; secundùm vero praesentiam cor∣poralem, simul & in sole, & in luna, & in qu esse non posset. Christs Bodily Pre∣sence could not (saith hee) be in the Sunne and Moone at once. Yes, will the Romish Answer; Miraculously it may. God a mercy Papist would the Heretike have sayd; for I likewise, when I sayd it was in the Sunne and Moone at once, was not such a Lunatick, as to thinke it could be naturally so, and without a Miracle. The same holy Father, that hee might shew himselfe constant to his owne Tene, explaining the words of Christ [You have heard that I sayd, I goe and come unto you] (wird Hee went away (saith hee) according to that, wherein hee was man, in one place: and hee remained with them as God, and in all places▪ still opposing the Nature of Man and God, according to the Different Presences of, One-where, and All-wheres. More Testimonies for proofe of this one point there needs not. {fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. THese so many and manifest proofes of the ancient Fathers, concluding an Impossibility of Existence of a Body without Determination in one place; may be unto us a full Demonstration that they were Adversaries to your Romish Doctrine of Cor∣porall Presence, and that all your Objections, out of them, are but so many forged, and forced Illusions. {fleur-de-lys} Onely be it knowne unto you, that in this whole Discourse the word,
Circumscription in place, is used, in a large Acception, for every limitation of a Body in a space, or Vbi, adequate unto the thing Circumscribed. {fleur-de-lys} Wee conclude. If Christ himselfe gave a Caveat, not to be∣lieve such Spirits as should say of his Bodily presence in this world, after his Resurrection;Mat. 24 23. Behold heere is Christ, and be∣hold there is Christ: then, doubtlesse, much lesse credit is to be given to your Church, which teacheth and professeth an Here is Christ, and a There is Christ, in the same instant; as wee shall furthermore confirme by like verdict of Antiquitie, when wee shall heare the Fathers prove both thatSee Cap. 6. §. 3. Angels, and all Created Spirits are finite Creatures, and not Gods, even because they are contained in one place: and also that the Chap 6. §. 2. Holy Ghost is God, and no finite Creature, because it is in divers places at once. But wee must handle our matters in order. That the Romish Doctors (in their Objections) have no solid proofe of the Existence of one Body in divers places at once: from the Iuagement of Antiquitie. SECT. VI. IT is a kinde of Morosity and Perversnesse in our Opposites, to object those Testimonies, which have their Answers, as it were tongues in their mouthes, ready to confute their Objections. ForChrysost. li 3. de Sacerdo; O mi∣raculum! O Dei be∣nignitatem! qui cum patre sut sedet, & eodem tempore omniū manibus per∣tractatur. Obijcit. Bel∣lar. lib 2. le Euch. cap. 22 [Not conside∣ring what went before  words, in the saue place, where hrysost will not have his heart be∣leeve, that the Priest and people ∣taking doe no [in ter∣tis consist sed po∣nus in coelum trans∣ferr then followeth, O miracul, &c.—adst enim Sacerdos non ignem gestans, sed Spiritum San∣ctum. Chrysostome saith not more plainly, ô Mi∣racle, that Christ, at one and the same time, sitting with his Fa∣ther in Heaven, is heere handled of Communicants on earth; than hee doth say of the Priest and People Communicating, ô Miracle, that They do not consist or stay on earth, but are trans∣ported into Heaven. And againe, a little after the words ob∣jected, The Priest (saith hee) is here present, not carrying the fire, but the Holy Ghost. These and the like Sayings of Chry∣sostome do verifie the Censure of yourSee Booke 3. Chap. 4. §. 6. Senensis upon him, that hee was most frequent in figurative Amplifications, and Hyperbole's. Another Objection is commonly made out of Chrysost. ad ulum Antioch. hom. 2. Helisaeus Mlotem accepit (Heliae) erat posthac duplex Elias, sursum Eliais, deor∣sum Elias. Then applying this to the Sacrament; Helias nempe melotem Discipulis uis reliquit: filius autem Dei ascendens nobis carnem : sed Elias quidem extus, Christus autem & ipsam nobis reliquits & ipsam ascendens habuit. Chrysostome, of a Double Elias, one above, and another below, (meaning, by Elias below, the sheepe-skin, or Man∣tle of Elias, received by Helisaeus) namely, that Christ as∣cending into Heaven, in his owne flesh, left the same, but as Elias did his Mantle, being called the other Elias, to wit, figuratively: so the Sacrament, a token of Christ's flesh,
is called his flesh. Which must needs be a true Answer, unlesse you will have Chrysostome to have properly con∣ceited, as a Double Elias, so Consequently a Double Christ. {fleur-de-lys} And if you be not yet sufficiently acquainted with the style of Chrysostome, take unto you another Saying of his, wherein hee introduceth Christ, as speaking to eve∣ry good Christian, and sayingChrysost. ad pop. Antioch. Hom. 55 Manduca me, & te sursum haben, & de∣orsum tibi conne∣ctor. Eate thou mee, I have thee heere above, and am annexed to thee there below. So hee. Do you understand those words, as you did his former Speeches, literally? then must you as necessarily conclude from hence, that the Christian Communicant, Eating Christ's Body here on earth, is corporally present with Christ in Heaven. But do you grant it to be figuratively meant? then must you confesse, that the Conjunction, spoken of by Chrysostome, is not Corporall, but a Spi∣rituall, and a Mysticall Communication. So then Chrysostome, speaking of a Sacrament, used a Sacramentall style, to call the Sacrament of Christ's Body, the Body or flesh of Christ; even as Christ (according to the Interpretation of Anci∣ent Fathers) called Bread his Body, as being a Signe and Sacrament of his Body, after the usall terme of Scripture in other Sacraments also. (All which have beene large∣ly showne throughout the Second Booke). No marvell therefore, if, granting that Christ taking his Flesh Per∣sonally with him into Heaven, which hee left Sacramen∣tally heere on Earth; you deny, notwithstanding, that Elias, by leaving his Mantle, left not himselfe, because his Mantle was not a Sacrament of himselfe. {fleur-de-lys} As for the next Testimonie, it is no more than which eve∣ry Christian must confesse, namely, that it is the same whole, and undivided Christ, which is spiritually received of all Chri∣stians, wheresoever, and whensoever throughout the world: the same wee say Objectively, although not Subjectively; as the Sixt Booke, Chap. 6. and Sect. 3. will demonstrate. {fleur-de-lys}And furthermore understand, that the Fathers, spea∣king of the Eucharist, and calling it The Body of Christ: and of the Fragments, Bitts, and Pieces thereof; yet, in your owne construction, do meane Sacramentally, that is, Figuratively.

Master Fisher would thinke it a sleighting of him, if his Testimony might not be heard. What marvaile (saith hee) that Imagination fayle us to apprehend the multiplied presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, which is Spirituall, Angelicall, Supernatu∣rall, comparable with the Divine? whereof Gregory Nys∣sen sticketh not to say; As Deity filleth the World, and yet
is One, so the Body of Christ is but One, and is offered in all places. So hee. Our Answer, in briefe, is that Ma∣ster Fisher sticketh not to abuse both the Credulity of his Reader, to make him believe that which is not; and his owne Conscience, to seeme to believe that which hee believeth not; (namely, that there is an Omnipresencie of Christ's Body) as also his Adversaries patience, to oc∣casion him to seeke that which is not to be found in the place alleged, or yet in any of the Orations of Gregory Nyssene, de Paschate. If any such Sentence had beene ex∣tant in any Booke of Gregory Nyssene, or else of any Pri∣mitive Father, ô how every one of your Romish Dis∣puters would have embraced it, and still harped upon it; especially it making so evidently for that, which your Iesuite urgeth, The multiplyed Presence of Christ's Body. But it is no newes with us, to be dealt with deceiptful∣ly, and unconscionably, by your Romish Dispu∣puters. {fleur-de-lys} That your most plausible Objection, taken out of Augustine, con∣cerning Christ his Carrying himselfe in his owne hands, is but Sophisticall. SECT▪ VII. AVgustine in expounding the 33. Psalme, and falling upon a Translation, where the words 1. Sam, 21. are these (by interpretation) Hee carryed himselfe in his owne hands; Aug. Tom. 8. in Psal 33. Conc. 1. [Esserebatur in ma∣nibus. ejus.] Hoc quo∣modò possit fieri in homine, quis intelli∣gat? manibus alie∣nis portatur quis, suis autem nemo por∣tatur. Quomodò in∣telligatur de Davide secundùm literam non invenimus: in Christo autem inve∣nimus, quando com∣mendans ipsum cor∣pus suum, ait, [Hoc est corpus meum:] ferebat enim corpus in manibus suis, &c. saith that these words could not be understood of David, or yet of any other man literally: for [Quomodo fieri potest?] (saith hee) How could that be, &c. And therefore expoundeth them as meant of Christ, at what time hee said of the Eucha∣rist, [This is my Body.] This is the Testimonie which not onely yourObijcit Bellar. Vox [Quodammo∣do] Signi, non pro∣priâ spetie, sed alie∣nâ, nec modo usita∣to, sed extraordina∣riè: satis est, quod non figuratè signifi∣catur Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 24. Cardinall, but all other your Disputers, upon this subject, do so ostentatively embrace, and as it were, hugge in their Armes as a witnesse, which may alone stop the mouth of any Protestant; which therefore, above all other, they di∣ctate to their Novices, and furnish them therewith, as with Armour of proofe against all Opposites, especially seeing the same testimony seemeth to be grounded upon Scripture. Contrarily, wee complaine of the Romish Disputers, against this their fastidious and perverse importunitie, in urging a testimony, which they themselves could as easily have an∣swered as objected; both in taking exception at the ground of that speech, to shew that it is not Scripture at all, and also by moderating the rigidity of that Sentence, even out of Augu∣stine himselfe.
THE FIRST CHALLENGE, Shewing, that the Ground of that speech was not Scripture. PRotestants (you know) allow of no Authenticall Scripture of the old Testament, which is not according to the Ori∣ginall, namely, the Hebrew Text; and the Church of Rome alloweth of the Vulgar Latine Translation, as of the onely Authenticall. But in neither of them are these words, viz. [Hee was carried in his owne hands:] but only that David, now playing the Mad-man, slipt, or fell into the hands of others, as yourTstatus Abu∣lensis. [Et collabe ba∣tur inter manus eo∣rum:] Nempè, ad modum hominis fu∣riosi ostendebat se, ut insanum, Cor. in um locum. Abulensis truely observeth. So easily might the Transcribers of the Septuagints erre, in mistaking  for : and so impossible it is for you to ground the objected Sentence upon divine Scripture, even in your owne judge∣ment. THE SECOND CHALLENGE, Shewing, that the Romanists cannot stand to the [QVOMODO] of Augustine. THis word [Quomodo, How] implying it to be impossible for David, or any other man, to carry himselfe in his owne hands, excepting Christ, as you defend, must argue either an absolute Impossibility, or not: if it intend an absolute Im∣possibility of any man to be carryed in his owne hands, in a literall sense, then could not Christ, as man, be carryed in his owne hands: and if it doe not intimate an absolute Impossibility, then might David, or any other man, by the power of God, have carried himselfe in his owne hands. So that whether thus, or so, you will make Augustine contradict himselfe, if his words be taken in the precisenesse and strictnesse of that which is a Literall Sense. THE THIRD CHALLENGE, Shewing, that Augustine in another word following, to wit, [QVODAMMODO] doth answer Saint Augustine himselfe to his owne formerly objected word [QVOMODO.] SAint Augustine after hee had sayd Quomodo, How? (a word seeming to signifie an Impossibility) lest that it, being taken
absolutely, might imply a direct carrying of himselfe in his hands at his Supper, he qualifieth that his speech somewhat after say∣ing; [Quodammodò, &c.] that is, After a certaine maner Christ carried himselfe in his owne hands. Which is a Modification, and indeed a Correction of his former sentence. Our next la∣bour must be to find out the meaning of his [Quodammodo] and what this maner of Christ's carrying himselfe was, in the judge∣ment of Saint Augustine. Whatsoever it is that a man hath re∣ally in his hands, were it a loafe of Bread, it were ridiculous to say, that hee carrieth a loafe of Bread, After a sort in his hands, if the same were Properly carried therein; as will ap∣peare most plainly in the fift Challenge. THE FOVRTH CHALLENGE, Shewing Saint Augustine to be an utter enemie to the Romish Cause in all their other conceited Maners, concerning Christ in this Sacrament. AGainst your maner of interpreting the words of Christ, [HOC EST CORPVS▪ MEVM] properly, you have heard Augustine often pleading for a Figurative Sense. Second∣ly, against your maner of bringing in the Body of Christ, by Transubstantiation, hee hath acknowledged in this Sacrament, after Consecration, the Continuance of Bread. Thirdly, a∣gainst your Corporall Existence of Christ in many places at once, in this Sacrament, or else-where without dimension of Place, or Space, he hath already contradicted you in both, holding them Impossible: and also by arguing that therefore his flesh is not on Earth, because it is in Heaven. Fourthly, Your maner of properly Eating Christs Body Corporally, hee willSee the fift Booke Chap. 5. Sect. 5. and Chap. 6. Sect. 3. renounce hereafter, as an execrable Imagination. Wherefore Augustine holding  Impossible for Christs Body to have any Corporall Ex∣istence in this Sacrament, it is Incredible hee could have resol∣vedly concluded of Christ's Corporall carrying of his Body, pro∣perly, in his owne hands. THE FIFTH CHALLENGE, Shewing that the [QVODAMMODO] of Saint Augustine is the same Maner, which the Protestants doe teach, by the acknowledgement of some Romanists. DOe you then seeke after the maner which Augustine belee∣ved? what need you? having learned it of Augustine him∣selfe, by his [Secundùm quendam modum, (where he saith) This Sacrament after a sort is the Body of Christ:] What, literally?
Nay; but (for so hee saith)August. Sicut secundùm quendam modū Sacramentum Corporis, Corpus Christi est; ita Sa∣cramentum Fidei, Fi∣des est. See above § 8. at (a.) As Baptisme (the Sacrament of Faith) is called Faith. And if you have not the leisure to looke for Augustine judgment in his writings, you might have found it in your owne Booke of Decrees, set out byDecret. part. 3. de Consecr. distinct. 2. C. Hoc est. Sicut er∣go coelestis panis, qui Christi caro est, suo modo vocatur cor∣pus Christi, illius viz. quod, &c.—voca∣tur{que} immolatio car∣nis, quae Sacerdotis manibus fit, Christi Passio: non rei ve∣ritate, sed significan∣te mysterio [Observe that in the words. coe∣lestis panis, qui caro Christi est, the word Caro is by the Glosse in Gratian interpre∣ted Species panis, at the letter (f) Caro, id est, Species panis, to avoid the absur∣dity of interpreting Christ's Flesh to be the Body of Christ] Gratian, where Augustine is alleged to say, that This holy Bread is after it's maner called the Body of Christ, as the offering thereof by the hands of the Priest is called Christs Passion. Dare you say, that the Priest's Oblation is properly, and literally in strict sense, the Passion of Christ? or that Augustine meant any such Maner? Surely hee did not, and therefore may wee most aptly expound Saint Au∣gustines [Quodammodo] by this Saint Augustine his [Suo modo] which is clearely and evidently explained by your owne Ro∣mish Glossa ibid. [Coeleste, &c.] Coe∣leste Sacramentum, quod verè repraesen∣tat Christi carnem, Christi caro vocatu: unde dicitur suo mo∣do, non rei veritate, sed significante my∣sterio, it sit sensus, vocatur Christi co∣pus, id est, Significat. Glosse, where it saith: The heavenly Sacrament, which representeth the Flesh of Christ, is called Christ's Flesh, so sayd, [Suo modo] after it's maner, not in the Truth of the thing, but in a significant mysterie, as meaning, It is called Christ's Body, that is, it signifieth his Body. So the Glosse. {fleur-de-lys} To conclude. Wee are in good hope, that you will give credit to that, which Many of your owne Doctors shall con∣fesse, and that with the approbation of your Iesuite Suarez, Suar. Ies in 3. Thom. Disp. 47. § 4 Quae coveniunt co∣pori Christi secun¦dùm le, non possunt dici de speciebus, nisi valdè metaphoricè & impropriè, eo modo, quo nomen rei significatae tribuitur signo.

Sacra∣mentum corporis Christi [Quodammodo] dici corpus Christi. who relateth thus much, saying, that whereas Saint Au∣gustine hath these words, viz. The Sacrament is called [Quo∣dammodo] that i, after a maner the Body of Christ; Many (saith hee) doe expound them as spoken very Metaphorically and Improperly: the reason whereof is cleare, because the Body of Christ is a thing distinct from the formes. So hee. Confes∣sing that those Many yield unto us that True and Figurative Sense of Saint Augustines [Quodammodo,] which wee have all this while contended for. {fleur-de-lys} In a word, rightly mightCalvin. Admonit. ut. ad Westphol. Augu∣stinum totum esse nostrum, omnes lib clamant. Calvin say, speaking of these Controversies concerning this Sacrament: All the Bookes of Augustine (upon this subject) proclame that hee is wholly ours. Much more, concerning Christ his not being Corporally here on Earth, will, by the judgement of Augustine and other Fa∣thers, be found in the fifth, sixt, and seventh Bookes; besides that which they affirme in this Booke, in the Chapters fol∣lowing.
THE SIXT CHALLENGE, In generall, Concluding the maine Point. BY this time, wee thinke, you may discerne betweene plaine dealing, and false juggling: for your Disputers have usu∣ally alleged, for defence of your Transubstantiation, and Corpo∣rall Presence in the Sacrament, the Sentences of Fathers used in their Sermons, and Exhortations, wherein commonly they exercised their Rhetoricke in Figurative, and Hyperboli∣call speeches, as hath beene confessed by your owne Do∣ctours; and proved by many their like Sayings concerning other Sacramentall Rites; but especially of the Sacrament of Baptisme: whereas our proofes arise directly from the Testimonies of the Fathers, which they have commonly had in their sad and earnest Disputation, in confutation of many, and maine Heresies, where indeed they were necessarily to make use both of their Logicko, for discerning Truth from Errour; and also of Grammer; wee meane the Exactnesse, and proprietie of Speech, void of Amphibologies, Hyperboles, and Ambiguities, whereby the minds of their Hearers, or Rea∣ders might be perplexed, and the Truth darkned. This one Consideration wee judge to be of necessary importance. And thus much concerning the judgement of ancient Fathers, tou∣ching this second Contradiction. That (thirdly) the Contradiction, and consequently the Impos∣sibility of the Being of one Body in divers Places at once, is evicted by two sound Reasons; the first taken from Contradi∣ctory Relations. SECT. VIII. YOu have alreadySee above  5. §. . heard of the Antecedent, which was granted by Aquinas, viz. It implyeth a Contradiction, to say a Body is Corporally in two places at once, because this maketh that one Body not to be one. Which being confessed, your have also heard your Cardinall making this Consequence, viz. by the same reason it muct follow, that it is absolutely Impossible. But besides, there are Actions and Qualities, whereof some are Relatives, and have respect to some place, and others are Absolutes. Of the Relatives you have determined that
Vnum corpus in diversis locis positum unum habet esse sub∣stantiale, sed multa habet esse localia: ex quo fit, ut omnia multiplicari debeant, quae consequuntur esse locale: illa au∣tem non multipli∣cantur, quae aliunde proveniunt, Relatio∣nes verò ad loca ne∣cessariò multiplican∣tur, propter dimen∣siones locorum. Ita∣que erit idem corpus sursum, & deorsum, propinqusi, & remo∣tum, poterit moveri in locum, & quiesce∣re in alio loco, nec tamen implicatur ul∣la contradictio. Illa enim dicuntur Con∣tradicentra, quae con∣veniunt uni respectu eodem, eodem tem∣pore, modo, loco. Ac nè id mirum vide∣atur, Anima huma∣na, quae tota est in toto corpore, & quo∣libet membro Cor∣poris, certè, ut est in capite, est remota à terra, ut in pedibus propinqua, ut in bra∣chio quiescere dici∣tur, & ut in altero mo movere. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 4. § Ac primum. One Body (say you) as it is in diverse places at once, might be below, and above, on the right hand, and on the left, behind, and before it selfe, may move, and not move, at the same instant, without Contradiction: because it is so said in divers Respects, namely, of divers places, as the soule of man in divers parts of the Body. So you. These are but Capriccious Chimera's and mungrell fancies of addle braines, who disputing of Bodily Locality can finde no Example, within the Circumferences of the Vniversitie of Creatures, but onely Man's soule, which is a Spirit: which point is to be discussed in the fift Chapter. In the Interim know you, that although Relations do sometimes take away Contradictions, where they are applyable. As namely, for the same Body to be high, and low, in respect of it's owne di∣vers parts, to wit, high in respect of the head, and low in re∣spect of the heele, wherein there is no comparison of any whole, or part with it selfe: yet if any should say as much of the same Body, whether whole, or part, as thus: The same whole head goeth before, and after it selfe: or, the same one finger is longer, and shorter than it selfe; hee may justly be suspected to be besides himselfe: all such like spee∣ches being as Contradictory in themselves, (and consequent∣ly Impossible) as for a man to say, hee is elder, and younger than himselfe. {fleur-de-lys} Which peradventure one of your Doctors saw, when hee denyed in this Sacrament any Motion at all; Because els (saithIoh. Paluter. à Castro. S. T. D. Lect. our. in. 4. Sect Tom. 4. Lect. 58 Christi corpus in hoc Sacramento non mo∣vetur ne{que} per se, ne que per Accidens. Et paulò post: Si ad Hostiae motum mo∣veretur, time ad Ho∣stiae motum esse sur∣sum simùl & deor∣sum. At hoc ex di∣ctis non sapit verum. hee) at the Motion of the Hoast, Christ's Body should be both below and above at once, which savoureth not of Truth. So hee. And although yourGabriel. Biel. Lect. 47. Cùn innu∣mera sint altaria, in quibus celebratur sacrum illud mysterium, si moveretur per modios orbes coelis, & sphaeras elementares ad s∣gula hujusmodi Altaria corpus Christi, esset in continuo motu, & moveretur ad contrari is positionum diffe∣rentias, simul se ad orintem & ad occidentem, meridianum & septentrionem, pro varietate situs Alta∣rium; quod est Absurdum & Ridiculosum. Gabriel Biel defendeth the Corporall Presence of Christ in Heaven, and on your Altars at once yet that If should move from North and South; East and West, and all at the same time, according to the variety of Altars, This (saith hee) is Absurd and Ri∣diculous. {fleur-de-lys} YouSee above Chap. 5. §.  will say, (and it is your common Sanctu∣ary) that Place is not essentiall to a Body, and therefore separa∣ble from a Body; so that a man may be in two places at once. And you may as well say, that because Time is not of the es∣sence of a man, some man may have a Being without any time, or else in two times at once. (But enough of this hath beene answered in the sixt Section.) Finally, this your Subtilty would have beene judged a pal∣pable absurdity by ancient Fathers; among whom Theodoret taught this Philosophie, to hold true in Divinitie (to wit) that
whosoever hath properly one thing on the right hand of it, and another thing on the left, it is Circumscribed in place. Whereby hee demonstrateth the Truth of Christ's Body, be∣cause it is Circumscribed: and that it is circumscribed, because it is written of him, thatTheod Dial. 2. cap. 3. . The Sheepe shall stand on his right hand, and the oates on the left. Nor do you your-selves teach, nor yet can you imagine his Body to want either his right hand, or his left, as hee is present in this Sacrament. One word more. TheSee above . §. 5. Fathers, who were many, that distingui∣shed the nature of Christs manhood from his God-head, be∣cause the first is Circumscribed, and the other is not circum∣scribed, would never yield to either of both, that it is both Circumscribed and not Circumscribed; as you do to Christ's Body, teaching it to be at the same time Circumscribed in Hea∣ven, when it is Vncircumscribed, as it is on many Altars upon earth. Divers other your Contradictorie Relations you may finde in the Sections following in this Fourth Booke. That (fourthly) a Contradiction, and consequently an Impos∣sibility of the Being of a Body in two places at once, is proved by absolute Qualities and Actions, which are voyd of Relation to Place. SECT. IX. VVEre it possible that Actions and Qualities, which have respect to Place, might avoid the Contradiction; yet of such Actions and Qualities as have no Relation to place, it will be beyond your imaginations to conceive so, as will appeare by your owne Resolutions. For your Cardinall, and your Iesuite Suarez, with divers others, have thusCorpus Chri∣sti, in diversis locis positum, habet unum substantiale, & quae sunt absoluta in eo non multiplicantur respectu diversorum locorum: unde quae recipluntu à corpore, sive Actiones sint, sive Qualitates, sive quae unque alia, non multiplicātur. Ratio, quà corpus unum est, non multa; ut si corpus Christi in uno loco calefiat, in alio erit calidum: si in uno loco vulneretur, in altero erit vulnerarum. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 4. Actus contrarij, ut amoris, & odij, assensus, dissensus, non possunt competere uno subjecto in diversis locis, quia vitales actiones proficiscuntur ex potentiae naturali, ut à principio agente, & eadem potentia non habet vim naturalem ad efficiendum actus contrarios—Ratio; inter actus cor∣trarios—tantam esse repugnantiam, ut etiam per potentiam Dei absolutam non possint esse in eodem sub∣jecto, & loco, quià sese omninò destruunt ex parte objecti. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp 8. Sect. . §. Atque. determined, that Such Actions and Qualities as are reall in a Body, without any re∣lation to place, may not bee sayd to bee multiplied in respect of di∣vers places, wherein the same Body is supposed to be: As (for example) the same Body to be hot in some Country, and cold in another, at the same time; wounded, and not wounded; passible, and not passible. And the like may be sayd of Love, and Hatred, which are vitall Actions, proceeding naturally from the Subject. So that the Body, which in one place is affected with love, cannot possibly but be so affected in what place soever. So your Disputers.
{fleur-de-lys}Who might have added one of the Oracles of your Church, Pope Innocent the third, where hee writes of your Romane Masse, saying thatInnoc. 3. de offic. Missae. lib. 3. cap. 22. Sed cùm incredibile judicatur, ut secun∣dùm eandem na∣turam simul esset mortalis & immor∣talis. It is judged a thing incre∣dible, that Christ should be both mortall and Immortall, accor∣ding to the same nature. On whom your IesuiteVasquez. in 3. Thom. Quaest. 76 Art. 6. Disput. 189. cap. 4. Qualitates, quae pendent à loco, ut telatae, quales sunt motus, actio in sub∣jectum, & passio ab Agente, &c. At om∣nia absoluta à lo∣co ita enunciantur, de corpore absoluto à loco, ut eorum enunciatio non li∣mitetur. Verbi gra∣tiâ, Si Petro convenit esse album, enuncia∣bitur de illo, sive fi∣lium habet, sive non, eò quòd albedo non convenit ei respectu filij—Sequitur, perinde esse dicere, si semel Petrus sup∣ponatur esse albus in uno loco, absolutè albus erit in omni l∣co. Idem dici porest de aegritudine, sani∣tate, &c. Vasquez will waite, holding the Generall Tenent, that whatsoever Qua∣lity it is, that hath no dependance of place, it cannot be limi∣ted in respect of place: Among these hee reckoneth Blacknesse, and Whitenesse. {fleur-de-lys} But have they any reason for these Points? Yes they have, (See the Margin) For your Cardinall denying that the same Bo∣dy, in respect of divers places, may be hot, and not hot at the same time, giveth us this reason: Because (saith hee) it is one Body, and not many. So hee. A reason Infallible. Your Iesuite Suarez also denying that the same party can love, and hate, con∣sent, and dissent at the same time, in respect of divers places, yeeldeth this reason; Because (saith hee) these repugnant affecti∣ons, belonging to one subject, cannot by the Omnipotency of God be together in the same, because they destroy one another. So Aquinas, and otherQuicquid per∣tinet ad Christum secundùm quod in se est, id potest ei tribui in propriâ specie, & in hoc Sacramento existenti, ut vivere, mori, dolere, ani∣matum esse.

Vasquez resol∣ved of Blacknesse, health, sicknesse, and the like, that they are not limited by any respect of place.

Iesuit Conincks, deny∣ing the Possibity of any thing to both Move, and be still at once, because this is Inconceivable, by reason of Contradiction, which is not (saith hee) to be avoyded by respect of the diversity of Pla∣ces:
Confirming his Conclusion by other Reasons, specified in the Margin; one is, that Divers Vbi's, or Places are as Repug∣nant, as are Heat and Gold, and the like. But enough now.{fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. WEE have in these your Premises received as true Asser∣tions, as sufficient Reasons, and as absolute Confessions as can be desired, which will be as so many Ponyards sticking fast in the bowels of your Romish Cause, to give it a deadly wound. As first this:See in this Book Chap. 9. § 2. &c. you teach that Christ, as he is in this Sa∣crament, hath no naturall faculty, either of Motion, of Sense, of Appe∣tite, or of Vnderstanding things past, all which notwithstanding hee hath in all perfection in Heaven. But to understand, and not to understand, to have, and not to have an Appetite, you will confesse to be as absolute Qualities, and Acts Contradi∣ctorie, as free from respect to Place, as are those which you have allowed, to wit, Grieve, and not Grieve, love; and not love, alive, and not alive: because man hath an Appetite and Desire, an Act of understanding in himselfe, not as hee is in one Place more than in another. {fleur-de-lys}A Parisian Doctor will give you his Determination, saying, thatLiber qui in∣scribitur, Olim incog∣nitur Carmelita Do∣ctor paris. in 4. Sent. Cùm esuries sit appe∣titus calidi & sicci, ille autem vel est na∣turalis, vel volunta∣rius, vel sensitivus, & velle comedere, sive sic, sive sic: Dico, quòd si appetitus satiaretur in uno loco, statim cessaret in alio loco de cibo sumpto. If the Appetite be satisfied in one Place, it doth not desire meate at the same time in another Place. So hee. How much more must this hold in the Vnderstanding part of things passed? which because they are Things passed, cannot be sayd to have Relation to any present place, no more than To freeze, and to be hot. {fleur-de-lys} Seeing therefore you have beene enforced, by infallible Prin∣ciples of sound learning, to hold it Impossible for one to love, and hate, and to have contrary passions together, because they are Contradictories, and would inferre, that one man should be, and not be himselfe: Therefore are you become necessarily Contradictory to your selves. Can there be a stronger Argu∣ment than this, to perswade Christians, that your Doctors are men delivered up to strong delusions, to beleeve lyes? of which kind this, of teaching a Body to be in divers places at once, is not the least; notwithstanding any Objection by you made to the contrary, as shall be shewne.
CHAP. VI. A Confutation of the first Romish Reason, obtruded for proofe of a Possibilitie of Existence or a Body in divers places at once, taken from the nature either of a Voyce, or Colour. SECT. I. MAsterIn his Booke of the Liturgie of the Msse: where he hath other as idle reasons as this. Brerely thus: The difficulty may be better conceived, rather than directly proved, by an ex∣ample of the same word: the which, being once ut∣tered, is thereupon at one instant in the severall hearing of sundry persons, and that not as a distinct noyse, confusedly multiplyed in the Ayre, but as one and the same peculiar word, distinguished by the selfe-same syl∣lables wherein it was uttered.

Garretius citeth divers Others, objecting both the manifold receiving of the same Voice in the eares of Thousands at once; and of the same Image of a mans face in the divers fractions and pieces of a Broken glasse. {fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. BVt the Doctor was answered, that the Example is many thousand miles remote from the Cause, for our Question is of the Presence of the same Body in divers places at once. Wee say, the same Body; but this your Example of Word, or Voice, which you Both call the same, is not individually the same in every mans hearing, as is here affirmed; but onely the same in kinde, by a multiplication of the sounds, and words uttered,
as Philosophy teacheth. Like as wee see in throwing a stone in∣to the water, it maketh at the first a Circle, and circle multipli∣eth upon circle, till the last come to a large Circumference: Even so theVerbum, quasi aërem verberans. Ci∣cero. Word, by Voyce breaking th Ayre, doth make in the Ayre Circle upon circle, till a ound come to the eares of the hearers; every of the parts of the Circle being articulated, through the multiplication of the first forme, from the severall emanations of the Rayes, the divers eares do no more receive the same individuall Voyce, than they do the same individuall Ayre, whereby the Voyce is conveyed. So that this Example is no more, in effect, than to prove the same Body in divers places at once, by the sound of a word in many mens eares; which is not individually the same, and serveth for nothing rather than to make the Disputer ridiculous. Thus was that Doctor answered, when hee confessed of the voice of the Preacher in the Pulpit, which is received by multi∣tudes of Hearers, and of his other Example of a colour of a red Cow, by multiplication of it's formes seene of thousand men's eyes at once, that it is not Numerically the same. {fleur-de-lys}And this you must grant, whether you will or no: because if (as your Doctor hathA little above at Num. 2. confessed, See the Margin) the Voice be nothing else but Ayre moved; then seeing the Ayre, which entreth in∣to one mans eare, is not the same with that which is received into another man's eare; the voice which is an Articulate impression of the Ayre, can be said to be no more the same, than are the eares of the Hearers. Which is furthermore demonstrable in this, that the voice is more and lesse percei∣ved of men, according to their distances in place from the Speaker, some hearing it more, and some lesse, some in whole, and some in part. But more and lesse cannot accord to one and the selfe-same thing. {fleur-de-lys} Take unto you a cleere Example (which is also your owne) and Apposite, when in aSee the Testi∣moi last proceding of Ioh. Garietius. Looking-glasse, broken into many pieces, you see many faces, (all of them being but so many multiplied and reflected Images of one face) you may see, that every Image in every broken piece of the glasse is not in∣dividually the same: {fleur-de-lys}For so many Apparitions in the Glasse are (by the Confession of your owneAuin. part. 3 qu. 76.

Vnius corporis locus, duorum, aut plurium non est capax: sed . Gre∣gory Nazianzen is at hand, ready to tell you, that there is as

A Confutation of their second, and third Reasons, taken from the Similitude of mans Soule, or Presence of God, devised to demonstrate a No-Contradiction of a Bodies Being in two places at once. SECT. II. TWo otherArgumentum sumitur ab exemplis Dei, & animae rati∣onalis. Deus est unus in infinitis locis indi∣visibilis, & anima humana est tota in qualibet parte corpo∣ris. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. Instances you have, whereby to maintaine your supposed Bodily Presence in two places at once; one is in mans Soule, the other in God himselfe. First, wee will enquire into the nature of the soule. Our exception against a Bodies Being in divers places at once, is by reason of the distance betweene place and place, for it is farre lesse than imaginable that one Body should in one and the same moment be at Toledo in Spaine, and at Paris in France; and yet not to be in the intermediate Space betweene both, which divi∣deth Toledo from Paris. But the Condition of the humane Soule is utterly different, for it is in the Bodily members, not as a Body in divers places, but as a forme in its owne matter, being virtually and operatively in each part, nor having Quan∣tity and extension, (the unseperable properties of a Body) but by a formall perfection, As containing the Body, and not contai∣ned thereof,Anima est in corpore, ut continens, non ut contenta. A∣quin. 1. qu. 52. Art. 1. saith your Aquinas. For the Soule is so in the head and foot, that it is aswell in the parts and members betweene both; and therefore, not being possibly severed from them, cannot be said to be divided from it selfe. Inso∣much, that if any member of the Body (as for example the hand) should be cut off, and divided from the Body, the Soule being indivisible ceaseth to be therein. So utterly dissonant is the Soules Being in divers places. Saint Augustine will tell you (in the VIII Chapter following, Section 6.) that there is, in this respect, a Greater difference betweene a Soule and a Body. And another Father will illustrate the like difference betweene Bo∣dies, and Angelicall Spirits, in the next Section. Nay, and your Cardinall havingSee above Ch. 3. Sect. 3. confessed already, that It is not possible by any divine power, that a spirit should be divisible af∣ter the maner of a Body; doth hereby as fully confute himselfe, as if hee had said, there is no comparison to be made be∣tweene Body and Spirit, in respect of Locall Being: how much lesse betweene it, and God the Father of all Spirits, who can∣not
be so in many places at once, that hee is not likewise both in every intermediate space, betweene place and place, and also in all places without them: this being the propertie of his infinitenesse to containe all places, and not to be contained of any. And therefore cannot this maner of Presence, without irreligious impietie, be applyed to any creature; which not∣withstanding, Quòd si quis requirat esse in loco àm circumscriptiv quàm definitivè, id requirere, ut non sit abi; dicere possu∣mus dari tertium modum existendi in loco, nimirùm, per solam praesentiam, quomodò Deus est in loco Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 4. §. Al∣tero. your Cardinall blusheth not to do in that maner, as was hitherto (wee thinke) never imagined by any Divine before him, namely, a maner of being of a Body in a place, which is neither Circumscriptively, as naturall Bodies are, nor Definitively, that is, so that being in one place, it is not at the same time in another, as Angels and Spirits are; but a third, how? By onely presence, after the maner as God is in place. So hee. O golden Divine! for who knoweth not that Exi∣stence in place onely by presence is a propertie of Divine Infi∣nitenesse? which being attributed to any thing, that is not God, doth equall the creature with the Creator, God himselfe. {fleur-de-lys}Not to mention the Difference of Opinions among Phi∣losophers themselves, touching the particular Seats of the Soule of Man: One sort of them assigning the Heart; as did Hypo∣crates, Chrysippus, and Aristotle: Another party placing it in the Braine; to wit, Plato, Gallen, and Averroës, all admit∣ting a Determinate Seate to the Soule, do thereby gain-say the Being therof in many parts of the Body, as properly oc∣cupying so many places. {fleur-de-lys} A Confutation of the former two Romish Instances in Mans Soule, and God himselfe, by Ancient Fathers, in their Doctrine concerning Angels, and Mens Spirits. SECT. III. ANcient Fathers (wee trow) were profoundly learned both in Philosophicall, and in Theologicall Mysteries, who notwithstanding (as yourIob 1. 6.

Na∣zianz. tanquàm dog∣ma fidei tradunt, An∣gelos moveri loca∣liter, neque omnibus locis praesentes, sed esse cuique locum suum, & spatium praefinitum, cùm illud necessariò requiratur, ut ab uno loco in lo∣cum alium veniant. Simili ratione con∣firmat hanc verita∣em Tert. Apol. cap. 22. Chryso. Hom. in Heb. 1. Ambros. lib 1. de Sp. S. c. 10. Damasc. l. 2. de fide cap. 3. Nazian. Orat. 2. de Theol. Athanas. Epist. ad Scrap. Teste Pieds Ies. in eundem locum Iob. Iesuite witnesseth) held it as a Do∣ctrine of Faith, that Angels, which are Spirits, have every one their owne definite places and space, and that they cannot be in divers places, but by moving from one place to another, which cannot be said of any Body that (as you say) is without motion in divers places at once. Surely, if ever such strange and paraphysicall, nay, more than Hyperphysicall Crotchets had entred into the minds of ancient Fathers, wee should have heard you allege, at least some one of them, if not for proofe, yet in pretext and colour of patronizing these your repugnant Paradoxes,
concerning a Body taking the right hand, or left of it selfe, and the like, Velut aegri somnia vanae singuntur Species. For your better satisfaction, wee shall allege some Testimo∣nies, which may sufficiently declare their Iudgement of an Im∣possibilitie of a Spirits being in divers places at one time, whether wee consider the Spirits of Angels, or of men; yea or the Hu∣mane Spirit or soule of Christ. Of Angels, Damascen;Damascen. Orthod. fid. l. 1. c. 17 & l. 3. cap. 7. Ange∣lus dicitur esse in lo∣co, : Deus autem ubique existens, co∣pora vero . They are so circumscribed in the place where they worke, that they cannot possibly be in moe places at once. Athanasius,Athanas. Tom. 1 Epist. ad Serap. p. 201. . As the holy Ghost filleth all places, so Angels are contained in a certaine place. Ac∣cordingly Ambrose;Ambros. de Sp. S. lib. 1. cap. 10. Se∣raphim quod jubetu exequitur, Spiritus quod vult dividit: Seraphim de loco ad locum transit, non e∣nim complet omnia, sed ipsum repletur a Spiritu. Herein do Angels differ from the holy Ghost, which filleth all things, that the Seraphims do move from place to place. Pope Gregory would be heard speake;Greg. Moral. lib. 2. cap. 3. Angeli, ut & nos, loco cir∣cumscribuntur: com∣paratione quidē cor∣porum nostrorum Spiritus sunt, con pa∣ratione Dei incir∣cumscripti Corpus sunt. An∣gels are circumscribed, being, in respect of our Bodies, Spirits: but, in comparison of the uncircumscribed God, they are to be esteemed as Bodies. So they. Our next speculation must be touching the soules of Saints departed. The Author set out by your selves, in the name of Athanasius, unto this Objection, How do the soules of Saints so often appear at one moment of time in the Sepulchres, as they seeme to have done? Answereth, that They are not the same Saints, but rather visions, and adumbrations of them, by transfigurations of Angels. Hee giveth his Reason, why hee thinketh the other impossible,Athanas quaest. l Antioch. 26. Quo∣modò (cedo mihi) una existens Petri aut Pauli anima,  apparere in suo monumento, & in mille templis per totum mundum, nec Angelus potest? . Edit Paris. Anno 1627. Because it is proper (saith he) to God alone to be at one moment of time in two places at once. So hee. And if the Fathers shall say, in effect, as much of the humane soule of Christ, you (wee should think) would require no more. Tertullian among his many divine Answers, to prove Christ to be God, he urgeth the Arian Heretikes with this one, as not the least:Tert. de Trinit. circiter medium. against the Ebionites. Si homo  modò Christus, quomodò adest ubi{que} invocatus? cùm haec non hominis natura sit, sed Dei, ut adesse  in omni loco: si homo tantummodò Christus, cur & Mediator invocatur? &c. Be∣cause Christ is present in all places, where he is invocated, which is a power not incident unto man, but proper to the nature of God. So he. How like you this? And Augustine may not be thought to dis∣sent, when in arguing he tooke as granted, that theAug. Epist. 57 ad  [Mecum eris in Paradiso] Non ex his verbis in coelo existimandus Paradi∣sus, neque enim in ipso die futurus erat in coelo homo Christus, sed in inferno secundùm animam, & in sepul∣chro secundùm carnem. Soule of Christ, when it departed this life, could not be in Heaven, and in Hell at once. As for the Being of God in divers places at once, which was your Cardinalls instance, for proofe of a Possibility of the Being of Christ's Body in many places, without Contradiction of making One not One, by dividing it from it selfe; wee know not whe∣ther rather to censure it egregiously absurd, or extremely im∣pious; seeing that the Being of God in divers places at once with∣out Contradiction ariseth from the very nature of Gods Infi∣nitenesse of Being in whatsoever place: which is (as your owne
Schoole might have taught him) so, asAquinas 1 quaest. 52. Art. 2. Containing all pla∣ces, and not contained in any: which the Fathers have as fully declared, in making Being in all places, as filling them with his presence, to be the property of his Deity. Such then is the impiety of your arguing; by labouring to defend the maner of the Being of a Body, by the maner of Being of a Soule or Spirit; denyed byNazian. O∣rat. 51. cont. Apolli∣nar. Obijcientem: Duo perfecta non continebat Christus, vz. divinitatem et hu∣manitatem. Resp.  ut vas unius modij non duos modios continet.) , &c. Nazianzene; and maner of the Being of a Crea∣ture, by the maner of the Being of God the Creator, exceedeth all Absurdities that can be named. The holy Fathers will have something more toBelow. Chap. 7. Sect. 2. & 4. say to you; but first wee are willing to heare what you can say for your selves. A Confutation of the Third Romish Pretence, why they need not yeeld to these Reasons whereby their Doctrine is pro∣ved to be so grossely Vnreasonable. SECT. IV. MYsteries of Faith (saith yourBellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. Argu∣mentum sumitur à mysterijs, &c. Cardinall) which exceed man's understanding, are onely to be apprehended by Faith, Such as are the Articles of the Trinity, of Christ his In∣carnation, of the Resurrection, of the Creation, and of Eternity it selfe; and so ought this, concerning the Presence of Christ his Body, notwithstanding any Objection from Reason. So you. Wee answer. Some of these former Mysteries wee confesse to be such as exceed man's understanding, yet such againe they are, as are not contrary to understanding, though above it; that is to say, such (and this you will confesse with us) as admit not Contradiction in themselves: for it is no Contradiction to say of the Trinitie there is One God, and Three Persons, because the Essence of the God-head is common to each person: or to say in the Incarnation there is one Person, and two natures; no more than to say, that in one man there is one person, and two essentiall parts, one his Body, the other his Spirit: or in the Resurrection to beleeve the same that was created, might be re∣stored to life, more than to beleeve that one grane of Corne dying, might revive againe: or in the Creation to beleeve that something may be made of nothing, than to say that a blinde man was made to see. As for the last Objection, saying that Aeternitas est instans Darationis, Bellar. ibid. §. Quin∣tum. Eternity is the instant of Duration, it is a Paradox: forAeternitas est duratio immutabilis, principio & fine ca∣rens. Lessias Ies. O∣pus. Var. de Perfect. devia l 4 c. 1. yet is it true, that Aeternitas est nunc stans, non nunc volans, ut tem∣pus. Cap. 3. Eter∣nitie is Duration it selfe, without beginning, or ending; which is conceived without Contradiction. In all these your former Pretences nothing is more conside∣rable than the miserable Exigence whereunto your Disputers
are brought, whilest they are constrained, for avoiding of Con∣tradictions in things subject to the determination of Sense, to pose us with Spiritual Mysteries, which are Objects onely of Faith, by reason of the Infinitenesse of their properties; and therefore may well exceed the reach of mans wit, and appre∣hension, without any prejudice unto Truth, by Contradiction: as if they meant to teach men to put out their eyes, and never any more to discerne any sensible things, by sensible meanes. By which maner of reasoning all the Arguments used by the A∣postles, against Infidels, for proofe of the Resurrection, and As∣cension of Christ's Body; all the Reasons of Fathers, against He∣retikes, in distinguishing of the Properties of the Divine and Humane nature of Christ in himselfe, and their former Testimo∣nies in discerning Bodies from Spirits, by Circumscription, and Spirits from God by Determination in one place; and lastly your owne Consequences of many confessed Impossibities, concer∣ning Place, (as the Impossibilitie that God should be contained in Place, as for one Body, having Qantity, to be incapable of a Place, and the like) are all utterly made voyd. For to what end were any of these, if your Pretences have in them any sha∣dow of Truth? {fleur-de-lys} You other Cardinall Contarenus observed more solidly out of Dionysius Areopagita, that theSet hereafter, Chap. 10. Sect. 6. nu. 6. God-head differeth from all other things in that it exceedeth all apprehen∣sion of man. {fleur-de-lys} CHAP. VII. The third Romish Contradiction, against the words of Christ [MY BODIE,] is by making a Body Finite, to be a Body not finite. SECT. I. IF (as you have said) the Body of Christ is, or may be at one time in so many places, then may it bee in moe, and consequently every-where at one in∣stant. This Consequence your ancient Schoole∣men taught, and your IesuiteQuasi non possit creatura esse u∣bique hoc (inquam) non obstat, nam om∣nipotentiam illi in∣tellexerunt prorsus naturalem: quia si non alienâ virtute, sed suapte naturâ res existat ubique praesens, haec reverà nulli creaturae convenit. At nos altero modo non nisi per absolutam Dei potentiam ubiquitatem creaturae arbitramur. Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de vera Christi praesent. in Euch. cap. 12. §. Quae sanè. pag. 241. Valentia doth seeme to avow, saying, What hindereth that a Body may be [Vbi{que}] every-where at once, not by it's naturall power, but by the Omnipotencie of God? So hee. This wee say is to make a Finite Infinite, and your old Schoole-Doctors are
hereunto witnesses, who have judged itVeterum The∣ologorum apud D.  ratio  est si idem corpus ssit esse in bus locis simul, potest in luribus, atque  ubique.—Et qua um eodem Thoma dicunt, Haereticum esse affire, corpus Christi esse  in duobus locis simul, quia ubiqu esse, est poprium Deo. Peste Surez tom 3. qu 7. Artic. 1. disput. 48. Sect. 4. Hereticall, to say, That the Body of Christ can be in divers places at once; because then he may be in infinite. So they. And heare you what your Cardinall Bellarmine hath publikely taught? To say (Dicere corpus Christi esse, vel esse posse in insinitis locis nul, immensitatem divinam requirit. Bellarmin. lib. 3 de Christo cap. 8. saith he) that the Body of Christ may be in infinite places at once, is to as∣cribe an Immensity and infinitenesse unto it, (namely, that) which is proper unto God. So he, and so also your other Doctors, to whom the Evidence of Truth commandeth us to assent. For what greater Heresie can there be against that Article of our Faith, concerning the Deity, and Godhead of Christ, begotten, not made, than to beleeve that there can be a made God? for so doubtlesse do they (whosoever they be) that thinke a Finite Bo∣dy may be made Infinite. CHALLENGE. YOu understand the Argument, viz. To beleeve that Chirst his Body may be every where, is a flat Heresie: but to affirme that the same Body is in many places at once, doth consequently inferre that it may be every where (as hath beene directly profes∣sed.) Ergo your Doctrine of attributing to the Body of Christ an Existence, in many places at once, is by the confessed generall grounds of Christianity plainly Hereticall. And from this our Conclusion your Aquinas will in no-wise dissent, who him∣selfe concludethAquinas 1, qu. 52. art. 2. Deus et lentia ininit, ideo non solu in puribus locis est, sed unique. Angelus, quia est virtutis. sinnae; non se extendit nisi d unum determina∣tum—unde sequitur quòd non siubique, ne{que} in pluribus lo∣cis, sed in  loco rantum. That the Angell is not in divers places at once, because an Angel is a Finite Creature, and therefore of a Fi∣nite power and operation; it being Proper to God to be in many pla∣ces at once. So hee. That, by the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers, the Being in divers places at once inferreth an Infinitenesse Proper unto God: which without Heresie cannot be ascribed to any humane Body; Proved from the maner of Existence of the Holy Ghost. SECT. II. STill you maintaine the Reall and Corporall Presence of Christ his Body in so many place as there are consecrated Hoasts at one time in the whole World, be they ten thousand times ten Millions of Millions, or how many soever: which, say wee, is to make the Finite Body of Christ Infinite. For
Aquinas (as yourVnum corpus esse ubique affirmare est Haereticum. Tho∣mas. Quia Catholic ex hac proprietate essendi ubi{que} dicunt antiquos Patres suffi∣cienter probasse Spi∣ritus Sancti Divini∣tatem, ut patet ex Augustino, Fulgent. Ambros. Basil. Teste Suarez ies. Tem 3. Disp. 48. § 4. Rat. 1. Iesuite witnesseth) held it Hereticall, to af∣firme One body to be every-where, because this is a Divine proper∣ty, by which the Fathers did sufficiently prove the God-head of the Holy Ghost, (namely) Augustine, Fulgentius, Ambrose, and Basil. So he. But how did the Fathers prove this, thinke you? it were good, that where your owne Authors be silent, wee heard some of themselves speake.Fulgent. ad Tra. simud. lib. 2. pag. 325. Spiritus Sancti in no∣bis habitatio non lo∣calis est, inhabitat enim Tunitas in sus fidelibus, sicut tota in cunctis: nec per separatos homines, & separata loca par∣ticulariter separatur Fulgentius his reason is, Because the Spirit of God dwelleth wholly in all the faithfull, separated in divers places.Basu. de Spir. Sancto, cap. 22. sub finem Reliquae vir∣tutes omnes in lo∣co circumscriptae esse credūtur nam Ange lus, quiastabat Cor∣nelio, non erat in e∣odem loco, quo cùm astt Philippo: ne∣que qui locutus est Zachaiae ab Altari per idem tempus eti∣am in Coelo suam implebat stationem. At Spiritus (Sanctus) simul & in Abaccuc operatus, & in Dan∣cle in Babylonia cre∣ditus, & in Catacta cum Ieremia, & cum Ezechiele in Cho∣bar; Spiritus enim Domini replevit orbem terrarum, [Quo ibo a Spiritu tuo?] Et Propheta; Quoniam ego, inquit, vobiscum sum, & Spiritus meus stat in medio vestri Basil thus: The Angell, that was with Cornelius, was not at the same time with Philip, nor was hee then in Heaven, when he was with Zachary at the Altar. But the Holy Ghost was together with the Prophet Daniel in Babylon, with Ieremy in the Dungeon, and with Ezechiel in Chobar.Ambros. de Sp. Sancto, lib. 1. cap. 7. Cum igitur omnis creatura certis naturae suae circumscripta limitibus, siquidem & illa invisibilia opera, quae non queunt locis & finibus comprehendi, substantiae tamen suae proprietate clauduntur, quomodo quis audeat creaturam Sp. Sanctum ap∣pellare, qui non habet circumscriptam & determinatam naturam? Ideò cum Dominus servos suos Apostolos destinare voluit, ut agnosceremus aliam esse naturam, aliud gratiam spiritualem, alios aliòo destinabat, quia simul omnes esse ubique non poterant dedit autem Spiritum Sanctum, qui licet separatis Apostolis inseparabilis  gratiae munus insunderet: quis igitur dubitat, quin divinum sit quod insunditur, simul pluribus, nec vi∣detur? corporeum autem quod videtur à singulis, & tenetur. Ambrose thus: Be∣cause the Apostles could not all be every where, Christ severed them, giving them all the Holy Ghost, which was inseparable in them: none therefore can doubt but it is a Divine Essence. S.August. contra Maxim. Arian. Epist. lib. 3. cap. 21. Cum sic laudetis Spiritum Sanctum, ut in sanctificandis fidelibus ubique praesentem esse dica∣tis, tamen negare audeatis esse Deum? [The Vbique, spoken of the Faithfull, hath the sense of Vbicunque, because the number of the Faithfull is but finite, and their places distinct, here and there, and not absolutely every where.] Augustine confuteth an Arian Bishop thus: You that prayse the holy Spirit, in sanctifying his faithfull wheresoever they are, how can you deny him to be God? {fleur-de-lys} Saint Hilary, to evince Christ to be a Divine Spirit, useth this Argument:Hilarius in Ps. 124. in illo verba Christi, [Ecce ego vobiscum sum, us{que} ad consummationem seculi.] Spiritus namque adest omnia penetrans & continens. Non enim secundùm nos corporalis est, ut cùm alicubi ad∣sit, absit aliunde. The Scripture (saith hee) saith, Hee is with his Church unto the end of the World; but not as a Corporall na∣ture, which is, when he is present in one place, to be absent from another. Accordingly, for proofe of the God-head of the same Holy Ghost,Athana. de umana Christi natura. Planè eadem a Davide de Sp. Sancto tradita sunt, Psal. 138. [Quo ibo a Spiritu tuo?] quibus verbis nos edoctos voluit, Sp. Sanctum esse qui omnia replet: & à facie tua quo defugiam? Salcendeo in coelum, tu illi praestoes: si descendero in infernum, tu ibi ades. Athanasius argueth out of the same Psalme, [Whither shall I goe from thy presence?] Conclu∣ding that The Holy Ghost filleth all things, and is therefore infinite in Essence. But how is this Infinitenesse of Being in all places proved? The Reason followeth, in the same place, from the Instances of Being in divers places at once: If I goe into Heaven, Thou art there, If into Hell, Thou art there also. So that still the Argument, for the Godhead, is taken from Being both There, and There {fleur-de-lys}
Didymus of Alexandria (whom Hierome acknowledgeth as his Master, for the understanding of Scripture) thus:Didymus Alex. lib. 1. de Spirit. Sanct. Hieronym. interprete. (xtatin Bibliotheca: S. Patrum. Tom. 6. pag. 679.) Ipse Spi∣ritus Sanctus, si unus ellect de creaturis, sal∣tem circumscriptam haberet substantiam—Spiritus au∣tem Sanctus cùm in pluribus sit, non ha∣bet substantiam cir∣cumscriptam sicut u∣niversa quae facta . [And ee pro∣veth  pluribus  in Prnphetis & Apostolis &c.] The Holy Ghost, if it were a Creature, should have it's Substance cir∣cumscribed; which because it is in many places at once cannot be circumscribed, as all things that are made. Vpon the same ground Cyrill of Alexandria, maketh the same ConclusionCyril. Alex. de Spiritu Sancto (quod non est Creatura.) Cum in loco & cir∣cum scriptione intelli∣gant quae facta sunt, Spiritus autem sancti non sit, de quo psal∣lit David, Quo ibo a Spiritu tuo? The Spi∣rit of God is no Creature (saith hee) because things Created are in one place, but of the Spirit of God it is written, whither shall I goe from thy presence? {fleur-de-lys} Let us fall to Reasoning. The Enthymem of the Fathers being this; The Holy Chost is in divers places at once, Therefore is hee God: The Major Proposition, you know, by the Rule of Art must needs be this: Whatsoever is in divers places at once, is God. So then the Syllogisme or forme of Argumenta∣tion must necessarily stand thus: Ma. Whatsoever is in divers places at once, is God. Mi. But the Holy-Ghost to in divers places at once: (The Conclusion necessarily following is this,) Con. Therefore the Holy Ghost is God. So these holy Fathers, every one Catholike without ex∣ception, pleading for the Godhead of the Holy Ghost. By whose Iudgements wee are taught that  doth Infallibly inferre a ; and that therefore the Contrary Profes∣sion of a Being of a Creature, in divers places, or spaces at once, is Hereticall; because the aforesayd Fathers Disputed against the Heretikes (named byEpiphan. Hae∣res. 69. Contra Ar∣omanita, qui dicunt Spiritum Sanctum esse creaturam crea∣turae. Epiphanus the Arioma∣nitae) who, as Pneumatomachi, madly oppugned the God∣head of the Holy Ghost. Now lest when wee seeke to pleade our owne Cause, Wee might seeme to desert them, whom you call Lutheranes, We held it a part of Brother-hood to take with us an excellent∣ly learned Doctor of Wittenberg, Iohn Gerhard: who pro∣ducing Bellarmines Objection against them, to proove them them to be Heretikes, in the opinion of the Presence of Christs Body, thus: If you give Divine Attributes to Christ's Body as Essentially, then are you Eutychians: and if you give them accidntally, then are you Nestorians. The same Gorhard argueth thus:Ioh. Gerhard. Confes. Cathol. lib. 1. part. 2 cap. 19. pag. 887. In hunc mo∣dum bellar. lib. 3. de Christo, cap 1. con∣tra nos tale producit Argumentum. Eutherani docent carnem Christi habere Attributa Divinitatis: ex quo sequitur eos vel esse Eutychinos, vel Nectorianos▪ vel Monstrum ex utraque Haeresi. Si enim dixerint ea esse communicata essen∣tialiter, erint Eutychiani; si Accidentaliter, erint Nestoriani, Respondet Gerhardus—Nec Essentiaiiter, nec Accidentoler ea communicata dicimus, sed Personaliter. Wee (saith hee) give not Divine Attri∣butes to the Body of Christ either Essentially, or Accidentally, but Personally. So hee, which hath in it a true and Ortho∣dox Sense. {fleur-de-lys}
CHALLENGE. AGaine, another Syllogisme from these Premises will set all straight. To ascribe to a Body an Omni-presency, and power of Being every-where, is Hereticall. But to say that a Bo∣die is in divers places at once, doth consequently inferre a power of Being in every place (as it doth, in demonstrating the Holy Ghost to be a Divine Spirit.) Therefore to attribute to a Body a Being in divers places at once, is a Doctrine Hereticall, and im∣plyeth a Contradiction, by affirming that a Finite thing either is, or possibly may be Infinite. Adde but hereunto the for∣mer See above, Chap. 5. & 6. Testimonies of Fathers, who have distinguished the hu∣mane nature of Christ from his God-head, and their denying of all Possibilities of Existence of Angels in two places at once; and your Consciences must needes tell you, that it was Impossible for the Fathers to have believed your Romish Article of a Corpo∣rall Presence in every Hoast Consecrated at one time, on divers Altars, in your severall Churches. What shall wee then fur∣her say concerning the Being of a Body in divers places at once? surely (that which hath beene plentifully proved alrea∣dy) that such an , or without Place, is egregiously , and absurd as well in Divine, as naturall Philosophy, because (as this whole Discourse sheweth they have verified that saying of Aristoile; {fleur-de-lys} A Vindication of Truth, against an egregious Infatuati∣on of the Iesuite Lessius, in framing an whole Army consisting of but one man. SECT. III. AMong other multitudes of Absurdities, take unto you the Assertion of your Iesuite Lessius, (wherein not∣withstanding hee is not alone) which wee propound unto you, not for your Instruction, but for your Recreation. Lessius Ies. O∣pusc. de perfect. divin. lib. 12. cap. 16 nu. 199. Existentia rei non impedit quo minus secundò, tertiò, quar∣tò centies, millies, eadem res produci possit—Vnde sequi∣tur ex uno homine effici posse integrum exercitum. [And this multiplication by pro∣duction is desended by Iohannes Lotus the esuit in his Epi∣stle to Conradus Ver∣stius; Secundò, tertiò, quartò & Iohannm product posse, &c. The Existence of a thing (saith he) hindereth not, but the same thing may be produced once, twice, thrice, an hundred, or a thousand times, so that an whole Army and Host may con∣sist of one man. Do you heare your Jesuit telling you of an Army of a Thousand, or (and if you will) a thousand thou∣sands of one man? which Army, if you shall range into cer∣taine Quarters, you shall have in one, a Squardon of five thousand of a Horseman; in another, Five thousand of a Pike-man; in a third Five thousand of a Musketier; in a Fourth, Five thousand of a Pyoner: Insomuch that upon such a multiplicity of Productions of this one man, the said one
man should be sayd to be furnished with all the different thousands of Armour and weapons, of Pikes, Muskets, Pick∣axes, or Shovells, as might belong to so many thousands of men. Although this Idle and dreamish Fiction deserve no other answer then laughter, yet seeing that Doctors of his Profes∣sion, and Jesuites also of his owne society are at hand, wee may not deny them Accesse; Bellarmine, Suarez, and Vasquez, these three Jesuites haveSee Booke 3. Cap. 3. §. 1. concluded, that Production cannot be but of a thing, that hath no Being before; but Christ (say they) had a Being, before any Priest could make his Con∣secration. So they. How then could this Iesuite soberly feigne to himselfe a thousand Productions of a man, that could have but one Production an being at all. Againe, you have neard, from your Doctors, two other Conclusions, One, That if wee consider the Bodily presence of Christ, as hee is out of the Sacrament visible,See above cap. 3. §. 3. It is not possible for him (say they) to be in moe then one place at once. And so Lessius his great Champion must have no Being at all. The second, that if wee understand Christs Bodily Presence, as it is in the Sacrament,See belew cap. 9. §. 2. It is Invisible (say they) and cannot exercise any faculty of Sense or Motion. And then must Lessius his imagi∣nary man of Armes be such a Captaine, as can neither see any enemy, nor yet be seene of any: or if seeing, yet, as a man bound hand and foot, hath no power to pursue his Foe, or if hee should make an encounter, yet is hee not able to strike one stroake, Who will not now say that your Jesuite had no other harnesse upon himselfe than pertinacie in this Impug∣nation and resistance of Truth. {fleur-de-lys} CHAP. VIII. Of the (fourth) Romish Contradiction against the words Of Christ [MY BODY,] by teaching it to be Or∣ganicall, and not Organicall; Divisible, and Indivisible. SECT. I. THE Question is not now of the Mysticall Presence of Christ his Body in the Sacrament, which wee with the Fathere, especiallyGreg Nyssen in Orat. Catech. 6. 37.

Sect. 7.] Gregory Nyssen, confesse, to be whole, as well in a part of Bread consecrated, as in the whole loafe; even as the Image of the King may be as perfect in a penny, as in a shilling. But neither hee, nor any Father ever sayd that a little Hoast,
(which Hoast you call Christ) is equall with a great Hoast; No, for the Fathers in the Councell ofSee below, . 11. Nice absolutely denyed this: nor yet is Christ wholly represented in the least part of the Hoast, as your Fathers ofSee. 3. following. Trent have taught, because no such part can resemble Totum Christum, whole Christ Sacra∣mentally, which is not of sufficient bignes to be sensibly eaten in the nature of nourishment; thereby to resemble the Spiri∣tuall nourishment of our Soules, which is the Body of Christ. So that all you have sayd maketh just nothing for the Corpo∣rall, and materiall Presence of Christs Body, which wee fur∣ther impugne. That it is necessary the Body of Christ (wheresoever) consist of distinct members and proportions of a Body. SECT. II. THE Body of Christ (as wee professe) had perfect Dimen∣sions and Distinctions of parts, an head exposed to prick∣ing with thornes, a Face to buffets, a Backe to scourges, Eyes to visible noddings and mockings, Eares to blasphemies, Hands and Feet to piercing with Nayles. This is that Body which wee confesse to be the Body of Christ, and which wee cele∣brate in the use of this Sacrament, in Remembrance that he had a Body consisting of proportion of divers parts, distinct one from another.

Magnitude, Proportion, and Extension of parts are unseparably united to the Body of Christ in this Sacrament: or else (saith one) If the Nose should stand where the Eye is, and the Eye where the Nose is, it should be a confused Monster. So they. So necessary it is, even in your owne faith, that the Body of Christ consist of Organicall parts, distinct one from another. That the Romish Church hath decreed a doctrine of Corporall Presence of a Body of Christ, with all the parts thereof in the least Indivisible point of the Hoast. SECT. III.

Your distinguish, that theRespondeo, quod est difficili∣mum, ob imbecilitatem.

Body of Christ being in this Sacra∣ment hath extension of parts of a Body distinctly in it selfe; but in respect of the Place, or of the formes of Bread, under which it is, the whole Body is without distinction in every least Part and Indivi∣sible Point thereof. CHALLENGE. THis is the common Resolution of the now Church of Rome. The exact discussion of this one point will in it selfe illum∣nate the Eyes of any Reader, to discerne betweene the Spirit of Truth, and of Errour; namely, to know, that there cannot be a greater Contradiction (and consequently Impossibility) than for a Body, consisting of proportionable dimensions of Parts, such as are Hands, Legs, Eyes, and other Organicall members, to have Being any where without Extension, Commensuration, and distinct Proportion of the same to the space, wherein it is, as the Pro∣positions following will prove. That the former Romish Tridentine Article is new, and contrary to the nature of an Organicall and Humane Body, in the Iudgement of Romish Doctors of later times. SECT. IV. ALbertus, Scotus, Aegidius are recounted amongst your lear∣ned, and ancient Schoolemen, who (as yourTotum Chri∣sti corpus in partibus indivisibilibus specie∣rum panis esse, nega∣ Albertus, Scotus, Aegidius—quia videtur impossible, in se corpus exten∣sum, & magnae mo∣lis cum tota organizatione & figura in puncto collocari Suarez. quo supra. pag. 683. Jesuite testi∣fieth) Though it impossible, that a Body, that hath Extension of parts, should be contained in an indivisible point. The same opi∣nion is ascribed by your Jesuites (as ancient) untoOpinio antiqua, quae fuit Durandi, dixit corpus Christi in Eucharistia non habere quantitatem. Fundamentum hujus opinionis fuit, quod essentia quantitatis est habere partes extra partes distinctas inter se, sieri autem non possit, ut si cor∣pus Christi habeat partes distinctas, in Euch. sit totum in qualibet parte.

Now what greater injury can there be, than, after that it was lawfull for a thousand and foure hundred yeares since the Ascension of Christ, for any Christian to pro∣fesse (with your ancient Schoolemen) an Impossibility, that The Body of Christ is whole in every the least part of the Hoast; to im∣pose upon mens consciences, as an Article of Faith, so found and so palpable a figment? That which seemed to the above-named Durand, Occham, and otherSuarez Ies. in 3. Thom. disp. 48. Sect. 1. De Distantis partium Nominales concedunt in corpore Christi, existentem in Eucharistia, pe∣dem non distare ma∣gis à capite, quam collum. Ità Occham. & Ailliaco. Nominals such an Opinion, whence (as they thought) it must needs follow, that the Eyes must be where the Nose is, the hand confouded with the legs: which (as your Cardinal Alan truly said) were to make of the Bo∣dy of Christ a confused Chaos, and altogetherSee above in this Chapter, Sect. 2. monstrous. {fleur-de-lys} And it may be that divers of you are of the minde of that Doctor of the Seraphicall order, who teacheth you toCorpus Christi non est nisi sub specie Panis, & partibus ejus: ipsum esse sub quolibet indivisibili ipsius Hostiae per se, negandum est. Magister de media villa, Sraph. Ord. in 4. Sent. Tom. 4. Deny that the Body of Christ is in any indivisible part of the Hoast. {fleur-de-lys} That the Organicall parts of the Body of Christ must be propor∣tionable to the Dimension of the places, wherein they are; is proved by the confessed Romish Prin∣ciple it selfe. SECT. V. THE reason, which yourSee above, § 2. Cardinall layet downe to prove it necessary, that Christ his Body should have in it selfe (ac∣cording to the nature of a Body) distinct parts of head and eyes, and other Organs fit for the use of a reasonable Soule, he taketh from Magnitude, which is an Extension of parts into their proporti∣onable length, breadth, and depth: This saith he is inseparably uni∣ted to Christ his Body in it's owne intrinsecall disposition, in it selfe; but not so (saith he) in regard of the place. CHALLENGE. THis your owne Reason may wee justly retort upon your selves, proving, that if the naturall disposition of the Body of Christ be thus proportionably extended in it selfe, it must be so likewise in respect of Place and Space; because the three di∣mensions of the Body of Christ (as you have confessed) stand thus, that one is an extension in Length, another in Breadth, the third in Depth, and each of these three are distinct one from another. Well then, the Arme must be here, and thus farre lon∣ger than the Foot, the Legge here, and thus farre thicker than
the Finger, the Hand here, and thus farre broader than the Toe, and accordingly distinctly in other parts. But Hîc, and Huc∣sque; Here and There, thus farre and so farre, being Relatives of Space, and Place, do demonstratively shew that that Exten∣sion of distinct parts of the Body, which they have in them∣selves divisibly, the same they must necessarily have in respect of the Vbi, Place, or Space, wherein the Body is. If therefore you will not Heretically teach a Mathematicall, or Phantasticall Body o Christ, you must deny the Article of Trent, untill you can beleeve, and make good, that a part of a divisible Body, lon∣ger or shorter, broader or narrower, can be (and that equally) in one indivisible point. This is confirmed by the Essence of Christ his glorified Body, (as you confesse it to be) now in Heaven, possessing a Reall place in the sayd proportion of Spaces of length, and breadth, as it had here upon earth, which it doth by the naturall Mag∣nitude, or Quantity thereof. But the sayd naturall Magni∣tude, or quantity of the sayd Body of Christ is (according to your wone generall Doctrine) in this Sacrament. Therefore must it have the same Commensuration of Space, although not of the same Space which is one earth. Wee should be loath to trouble your wits with these specu∣lations, if that the necessity of the Cause (by reason of the Ab∣surdities, of your Romish profession) did not inforce us hereun∣to; Therefore must you suffer us a little to sport at your trifling seriousnesse, who writing of this Divine Sacrament, and seeing it to be round, solid, broken, moulded, in the one kind; and liquid, frozen, and sowring in the other, do attribute all these to Quantities, and Qualities, and Accidents, without any other subject at all. So then by the Romish Faith wee shall be constrai∣ned to beleeve, in effect, that the Cup is filled with Mathe∣maticall lines, the Mouse eating the Hoast is sed with colours, and formes: that it is Coldnesse that is frozen, and Roundnesse which weigheth downe, and falleth to the ground; as if you should describe a Romish Communicant to be a creature clo∣thed with Shadowes, armed with Idaea's, fed with Abstracts, augmented with Fancies, second Intentions, and Individuall Vagues, and consisting wholly of Chimaera's. That your Romish Doctrine is contrary to the Iudgement of ancient Fathers. SECT VI. IF this your profession had beene a Catholike Doctrine, doubt∣lesse S. Augustine (who is so devout in his fervent Meditations upon this holy mystery) would not have oppugned it, as hee
did, when unto that Question of Volusianus (whether the Bodie of Christ before his Birth did fill the Body of the Blessed Virgin) hee answered,Aug. Nullum corpus potest esse u∣bique totum, quan∣tumcun{que} corpus, vel quantulumcun{que} cor∣pusculum loci occu∣pet spacium, eundem∣què locum sic occu∣pet, ut in nulla ejus parte sit totum ne∣cesse est: longè alia natura est animae, quàm corporis, quan∣to magis Dei? Lib. 1. Ep. 3. ad Volusian: [Whose question to S. Augustine was; Vtrum Christus in∣temeratae foeminae corpus impleverit?] That every Body, be it greater or lesse, where∣soever it is, must needs fill that space wherein it is, so that the same, Body cannot be the whole in any part thereof. So hee: which is di∣rectly Contradictory to your Article of Trent, for here is ex∣presse mention of Relation to Place and Space. And whereas for usuall colour of a Possibility, that the whole Body of Christ is in every part of the Hoast, you have objected the Example of Man's Soule, which is sayd to be whole in every member and part of the Body: Saint Augustine (as if hee had fore-seene your mystery of Errour) pre-occupateth, saying, In eo quod dici∣tur Deus ubique, car∣nali cogitationi re∣sistendum est, & mens acorporis sen∣sibus amorenda, ne quasi spaciosa mag∣nitudine opinemur Deum per cuncta diffundi, ut aër, aut lux: omnis enim hu∣jusmodi magnitudo minor in sua parte, quà in toto: sed ita potius, ut est magna sapientia eti∣am in homme, cujus corpus est parvum—Nm si duo sint ho∣mines aequaler sa∣pientes, quorum alter est corpore grandir, non plus sapiunt am∣bo, quam singuli; sic in minore corpore non minor est sani tas, cum minora, & majora corpora tam san sine—Dispr est profecto in mem∣brorū molibus quan∣titas: sed par est in disparatis sanitas—quae non quantitas, sed qualitas est. Non pott ergo obtinere quantitas corporis quod qualitas. Aug. Epist. 57. ad Dardan. The nature of a Soule is farre different from the nature of a Body. And againe the same holy Father, seeking to find out some Similitude, whereby wholly to resemble the Existence of God, in respect of Place, in the end saith, that Quality hath a prerogative to make some Similitude hereof: and hee doth in∣stance in Wisedome, which (saith hee) is as great in a little man as in a great man; but denyeth that Quantity hath any such Pri∣vilege, for speaking of Quantity and Magnitude, In all such Quantity, or Magnitude (saith hee) there is lesse in the part, than there is in the whole. And by this same Maxime (concerning Whole in respect of Place) hee distinguisheth the God-head from the Man-hood, by which you have confounded them. And yet againe else-where (as though hee thought this your delusion could never be sufficiently contradicted, or rather derided) hee will further have you not to be so Childish, as not to know, thatIdem. Minor est unus digitus quam tota manus, & minor est digitus unus quam duo; & alibi est iste digitus, alibi ille, alibi coetera manus—Nec solùm immobilibus corporis articulis—sed etiam aëris partes suos implent locos—Lucis{que} pars alia infunditur per hanc fenestram, alta per aliam, & major per majorem, per minorem autem minor. Idem Tom, 6.  fundament cap. 1. The little finger is lesse than the whole hand, and one fin∣ger is lesse than two, and that one finger is one where, and the o∣ther another where. Vpon which where, and where, being notes of distinct places; wee may aske, where are your Disputers now? Nay yet furthermore, passing from grosser Bodies, he saith as much of Ayre; yea, and of the most subtill of subtills, the light of the Sunne; one part whereof (saith hee) cometh in at one window, another at another window, yet so, that the lesse passeth through the lesse, and the greater through the greater. Moreover, if Saint Gregory once Bishop of Rome had belee∣ved that Christ his Body is whole in every least indivisible part of the Hoast, hee would never have condemned the Eutychian Heretike for beleevingAuungebat (Haeretious) omne illud, quod in Do∣mino  potuit, post resurrectionem in soitatem aliquam esse redactam. Greg. Exposit. Moral. lib. 14. cap. 31. The Body of Christ to have bin brought into such a subtilty, that it cannot be felt. But a greater subtilty
there cannot be, than for a divisible Body to be enclosed in every the least indivisible point. Show us this Doctrine taught by any Catholike Doctor in the Church, within the compasse of the twelve hundred yeares after Christ, and then shall wee con∣ceive better of your Cause. And lest you may talke (as you use) of one Body penetrating another, wee lay unto you, as Da∣mascen sayd unto his Reader, thatDamasien. l. 1. de Orthodox  . This is impossible, but that either the one or the other must be divided asunder. Wee say furthermore, that though this were granted, yet would you your selves deny that the other must follow, as you may discerne in Angels, who are Spirits, and moe of them may be naturally in one singular place, yet no one, can be naturally in two places at once. That the Romish Objections, against our former Tenet, taken from Miraculous Penetrations, are feeble and vaine. SECT. VII. IT is ordinarily in the mouthes of every one of you to object the Miraculous entrance of Christ into the house, the doores being shut; his coming out of the grave, when it was covered with a stoe (as some thinke;) his Birth from his mother, her wombe being shut; besides the miraculous passing of a Camell through the eye of a needle, spoken of by Christ; all Miraculous indeed, as wee, with many holyChrysost. Na∣zian. Aug. Ambros. Fathers, do willingly Confesse. What therefore? Therefore (say you) the Body of Christ did passe through the sub∣stantiall dimensions of the Body of the Doores, Stone, and wombe; and consequently confuteth all this, which hath beene spoken of the Organicall proportions of a Body, in respect of Space, or Place. So you. Wee grant unto you as much as these Fathers speake, in noting each of these to have beene the Acts, and workes of Omnipotencie, but yet without any penetration of Dimensions at all, or yet Alteration of the just proportion of Christs Body. Which penetration of Dimensions seemed to yourDurand Disp. 14, qu 6. [Whom you therefore reject.] Tese Surez. Tom. 2. Disp. 48. quaest. 54. Art. 4. §. 5. Durand as incredible, as unto us; and isImpossibilm etiam  hac putat esse opinionem probibilem Teste Lo∣ino  in Act. 5. 19. Impossible. The principal Testimony, which is insisted upon, concerning the passing of Christ through the Doores, is the saying of Chrysostom, viz.. Chrysost. Hom. 7. in Ioh. 21. [but according to the Latine Edition, Hom. 86. super Ioh. 20. This testimony was objected against P. Mar in the Disp. at Oxo. fol. 60.] Christs Body was thinne, or small, changed from [] that is, it's thicknesse, impalpable unto mortall mans hand, but only by Divine permission and dispensation. So hee. And this is al∣leged for proofe of a Possibility of his now Corporall Presence in the Sacrament, voyd of Palpabilitie: never considering the Or∣dinary and confessed Hyperboles, wherewith Chrysostome em∣bellisheth his Sermons; insomuch that wee may oppose Chry∣sostome against Chrysostome, even in the point in question: who
else-where speaking of this Sacrament, saith that Christ herein Booke 3. cap. . Sect. 6. Giveth his Body both to be felt and seene; wheras every Priests hands and eyes can testifie the contrary. {fleur-de-lys} Would ye understand the judgement ofChrysost. de Resurrect. Hom. 9. Non est meum ludi∣ficare meos phantal∣mate, &c. See this Te∣stimony above Book. 3. Chap. 3. §. 9. Chrysostome indeed? then leaving his Amphibologies, consult with him in his plaine and direct Assertions, where hee doubteth not to say, that If Christ at his Resurrection had offered his Dis∣ciples only an Image of his Body, to the deceiving of their eyes, it had beene a Delusion. Next that, Howsoever the sight of his Disciples might have beene deceived, yet their touch could not erre, in discerning a true Body. And is it not then a marvel∣lous Infatuation in your Professors, who whilest they Tast, See, and Touch Bread in the Sacrament, beleeve contrary to their senses, that they are meere Accidents? Thirdly, in Conclusion, hee saith that his Passing thorow the Doore was not in his Humane Substance alone, but by his Divine virtue. What can this meane, but that the Penetration made was not by extenuation of his Body, but by the Omnipotent power, constraining the place to make a passage to his Bodi∣ly Substance? {fleur-de-lys} For what? that Christ his Body, in passing through the Doore, should not alwayes have beene palpable in it selfe? The Fa∣thers of the Generall Councell at Ephesus would have protested against this, whose Resolution is, thatConc. Ephes. Tom. 5. Cap. 1. Ana∣them. 3. Non alienu esse ab illo corpus, quod sibi univit, quod ubique palpabile, & aspectabile existit. The Body which Christ united to his God head is palpable: but you will aske then, how could it passe through either Stones, or Doores, without pe∣netration of Dimensions, or els by an extreame tenuity of the Body it selfe? Wee answer, that the Divine power constrained the Stone and Doores to yeeld a passage, the Thicknesse of his Body continuing the same. Wee have Hierome for the first part teaching,Hier. Crea∣tura cessit Creatori. The Creature (saith hee) yeelded to the Creator? and ancient Iustine, for the second, most aptly, and exactly, Iustin Martyr quaest. ad Orthodox Quest. 117. pag 363.  &c. As Christ did tread the Water, not by changing his Body into Spirit, but by his Divine power: So hee passed thorow both Doores and Sepulchre being shut, by his Divine power, above nature, in his unaltered Body. Hee proceedeth, shewing how; even as was his walking, by his Divine power working upon the water, without any Alteration of his Body, more than was of the Body of Peter, who was enabled by the same power to tread the water. {fleur-de-lys} The Alteration then was not in his Body, but in the o∣ther things, such as were the Doores, thorow which hee passed:Cyri. Alexandr. in Iohan. lib. 12. cap. 53. Clausis foribus Dominius omnipotentiâ, suâ, superatâ naturâ rerum, intravit. The nature of things being overcome by Christs Om∣nipotencie,
hee made his entrance, as saith Cyrill of Alexan∣dria. And why should not the Creature yeeld  Crea∣tor, rather than the Creator to the Creature? Will you give you Jesuite Lessius licence to interpose his judgement, who maintaining a Possibility of a maner of Penetration of a Bo∣dy by a Body, yet discussing the maner [How, will tell you that. Ex quibus pa∣tet, juxta hanc sen∣  penetr  ponere in ip∣s beatis, nisi poten∣tam quindam mo∣r, quae in eo consisti, quod Deus , ipsis volen∣tibus, assistere ad hunc effectum. Lib. 7. cap 9. It is done not by the Quality, whether naturall, or Su∣pernaturall in a glorified Body; but by Gods immediate Assist∣ance: and that the Saints themselves (who are sayd to pene∣trate other bodies with their bodies) have no other power than that which may be called morall, which is to be willing to passe thorow any body: and God, according to their wils, assiteth to worke the effect. {fleur-de-lys} Each of which Sayings of the Fathers, professing a Body of Christ palpable, (whether Thinne with Chrysostome, or Thicke with Iustine) doe confute your Tridentine Faith in beleeving a Body of Christ whole in the whole, and whole in every least part of the Hoast, as unpalpable to man, as you have sayd it is invisible to the Angels themselves: which is to bring it to such a Subtil∣ty, as will draw you whether you will or no into a kindred with the Eutychian Heretikes, who (as yourAquinas par. 3. quaest: 54. art. 2.

Thus your owne spirit of Contra∣diction, whereas two words might have quit the Heresie, main∣tained the Miracle, and defended the Integrity of that sancti∣fied Wombe of the Blessed Virgin, (to wit) that the Virginall cell might be said to open it selfe, which was shut in respect of other Women (who necessarily suffer violent rupture by the Birth) being preserved from all hurtfull violence, either from within or without; which could not be without a perfect Miracle. Furthermore hearken to the Answer of some other Doctors of your Church, and you shall find your owne Doctrine to smell ranke of the Heresie of the Marcionites, in the opinion of the fore-cited ancient Fathers; for your fore-namedApud Maldon.

Jesuite telleth you of some Doctors in your Church (whom hee him∣selfe approveth) who taught that The Fathers, who sayd that Christ did open the Matrix of his Mother, spake it in the heat of Dispute against the Hereticall Marcionites, who denyed that Christ had any true Body; because that els the sayd Fathers should seeme to make Christ his Body to be no better than an Incorporeall, and on∣ly imaginary thing. So they. Which proveth, that in the judg∣ment of those Ancient Fathers, all your defence, in this Case, is at least Phantasticall.

As for the Entrance of theMatt. 19. 24 Camell, which is said by Christ, to passe through the eye of a needle; the subtlty of your Objecti∣on is not so needle-sharpe, but that it may be easily blunted: for Christ spake by way of comparison, and implyed as well an Impossibility, as a Possibility. Thus; as it is simply Impossible for a Camell (be it Rope, or be it Beast) to passe through the eye of a Needle, retaining the same Dimension and Property: so is it Impossible for a Rich man, so long as hee hath on him a great Bunch or grossenesse of confidence in his riches, and worldly affections, to enter into the Kingdome of God. Although o∣therwise, as it is possible for God, by his miraculous power so to contract the Camell, that it may passe through the Needles eye; so is it as possible to him, by his Omnipotent power of Grace to abate the swelling bunch of worldly Confidence in the heart of the Rich-man, that hee, being truly mortified, may repose his whole trust in God himselfe, and at length enter into the King∣dome of Heaven. {fleur-de-lys} This you might have learned from Saint Hierome, who saith that in this SimilitudeHieron. ad∣vers. pelag. lib. 2. Vndè difficultas dif∣ficultati, imo impos∣sibile impossibili comparatur, quià nec Camelus potest in∣trare per foramen a∣cus, nec divites in Regnum Dei. Impossibilitie is compared with Impossibilitie, because as a Camell cannot passe through the Needles eye, no more can richmen enter into the Kingdome of Heaven. So he, speaking of the Rich-man, in Sensu Compositio, so living and dying, as making Mammon their God; and not using them unto works of Piety and Charity; for so the same holy Father expresseth himselfe,Hieron. in Matth. 19. v. 24. Sed si legamus Esaram, quomodo Cameli Madiam & Epha ve∣niant Hierusalem cum donis at{que} mu∣bus: & qui pius curvi erant, & vitiorum pravitate distoti, ingrediantur ports Hierusalem: videbimus quomodo sti Camli, quibus Divites comparantur; cum dep grave in Sarcia peccatorum, & totius corporis privitatem intrare possint per agustam portam. As the Camels Beasts to whom the rich are resembled) could passe through the straight gate of Hierusalem, as soone as they were disburthened of their loads; So Rich men, casting off the load of their sins, may en∣ter in at the straight gate that leadeth unto life.

there is part of Christs Body, (in the Sacrament) there is the whole: there being the same reason of this as there was of Man∣na, whereof it is written, Hee that gathered much had no more than others: and hee that gathered not so much had no whit lesse. Which your Romish Glosse applyeth to the Sacrament, to signifie that There is no lesse quantity of Christs Body, under a lesse quantity of the Sacrament; none greater, under a greater. Our Answer is Three-fold. I. That your Doctors could ne∣ver yet prove the writings, which goe under the name of PopesLegat qai ve∣lit nostri Roberti Coci Censuram Scriptorum. Decret all Epistles to have beene truly theirs, whereof many of themselves have doubted, and which some al∣so have denyed. II. That the Comparison fighteth main∣ly against your professed Romane Faith in this very point, which you contend for. For you teach Body of Christ to be whole in the whole, and in every the least imaginable part of the Hoast, without all maner of situation therein, so, as not having the Head above, and the Feete below. This you cannot deny to be your owne positive Tridentine Sense. But the Manna, which was diminished and augmented in Quan∣tity by Gods providence, had notwithstanding a certaine determinate Quantitie, expressely mentioned in the same Text: Every man a Gomer, according to their families namely every one an equall, but yet a severall measure and Quantity; for one mans Manna was not the same which another had. This agreeth not with your Corporall eating of one, and the same Body of Christ. Next, the Granes of the same Manna (for it was like Coriander-seed) had their seve∣rall situations and distinct places in every Gomer, some lying above, and some below, some on the right side, and some on the left side of the Measure; which differences you abso∣lutely deny to accord with the maner of Christs being in this Sacrament. III. The Comparison will farre better suite with the Spirituall soules receiving of the Body of Christ: Every Faithfull one indeed participating the same whole Christ, by Faith, whether in a Greater or lesser Hoast, without all proportioning of his Bodily Dimensions. {fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. SHall not then the Novelty of your Romish Article, which was no so much as beleeved of Romish Doctors of this last Age of Christianitie? Shall not your Contradiction to your owne Romish Principle? Shall not the expresse Testimony of Saint Augustine, who as hee was universally acknowledged to be a Catholike Father; so was hee never condemned by any other Catholike Father for this his Doctrine concerning the Exi∣stence
of Bodily parts according to proportionable Dimensions of Space? Finally, shall not the affinity, which your opinion hath with damnable Heresies, perswade you of the falsity of this your Romish Faith? CHAP. IX. Of the fift Romish Contradiction against the words of Christ [MY BODY] as the same Body is now con∣sidered to be most perfect, by making it most Imperfect. SECT. I: NOne will thinke we neede to impose any absurd Doctrine upon your Church; the Absurdities which wee have already heard professed ther∣in, under the testifications of your owne Dis∣puters, having beene so marvellously and pal∣pably absurd, as hath beene shewne. Among which wee may reckon this, that followeth, as not the least prodigious Consequence of your Romish Corporall Presence (to wit) That your Church of Rome alloweth a Doctrine, teaching a Body of Christ, now glorified, to be destitute of naturall and voluntary motion of Sense, and of Vnderstanding. SECT. II. CAtholike Faith never conceived otherwise of the humane nature of Christ, after the Resurrection, but that hee was able naturally of himselfe, as hee was man, to performe the per∣fect Acts, which other men can, who are of right constitution of Body, and of sound understanding; such as are the functions of Iudgement, and reason, and of appetite, sense, and motion, accor∣ding to the liberty of his owne will. This Doctrine was above a thousand yeeres Catholike. But your now Romane Faith is to beleeve, as followeth in the Conclusions set downe by your
JesuiteSuarez. Ies. Dico secundò corpus Christi, ut est in hoc Sacramento, potest per se moveri loca∣liter à Deo: loquor de potentia Dei ab∣soluta, Nam juxta legem statutam sup∣pono corpus Christi nunquam separari à speciebus, nec moveri nisi motis illis—ne{que} in hac conclusi∣one invenies Theo∣logum ullum aperte contradicentem.

Loquor de naturali virtute, non ut est instrumentum verbi operans per virtutem miraculorum effectri∣cem. Ratio, quia non potest anima movere corpus suum nisi per membra organica, quae habent extensionem in locum: Sed membra corporis Christi non hoc modo existunt in hoc Sacramento—multo minus potest movere species Sacramentales, quas nec physice contingere possit, neque ad motum voluntatis movere. Ibid Conclus. ult. Potest ut est in hoc Sacramento virtue extrinseca moveri per Accidens, quia possunt Sacramen∣tales species moveri, ut a Sacerdote, Elevando. Sect. 3. De sensibus exterioribus Nominales citati dicunt posse Christum, ut est in hoc Sacramento, ut Deum audire, &c. Alij hoc negant. Sunt nonnulli, qui negant id fieri posse de Potentiâ Dei absolutâ, ut corpus in extensum à loco aut seipsum videat, aut alia. Dico, non potest naturaliter exercere actus sensuum exteriorum. Ita tenet Thomas & Alij Authores—quia sensus ejus non potest recipere has species ab objectis externis, quia hic actus est materialis, & extensus suâ naturâ—Quamvis potentia absoluta potest—Idem dicendum de sensibus interioribus & apetitu sentiente, quia non uti phantasmatibus, nec actum secundum elicere, quia hic actus est materialis, & nisi à materiali & ex∣tenso principio non potest intellectus ejus secluso miraculo—acquirere novas species, nec prius exquisitis uti quia intellectus hoc non potest facere, nisi simul phantasia operetur cum intellectu: non loquor de speciebus in∣fusis.

At Christi corpus est in Sacramento indivisibiliter, &c. Suarez, and other Romish Doctors: First, that Christ, as hee is in this Sacrament, hath no power naturally of himselfe to move himselfe. And this your owne dayly experience hath brought you unto; whilest beleeving Christs Corporall Presence in the Hoast, you shut him up in a Boxe, where you still find the same lying as destitute of power of motion, as any other un∣consecrated Bread; which being put together with it lyeth so long, untill they both equally waxe mouldy, putrifie, and ingen∣der wormes. Secondly, that Christ in himselfe, as being in this Sacrament, hath no naturall faculty of sense, nor abilitie (without a miracle) to heare or see, &c. Thirdly, That hee is voyd of all sen∣sible appetite. Lastly, that (without some miraculous power) hee cannot possibly apprehend in his understanding any thing present, nor yet remember any notions past. So hee. —Iosephus Angles Florent. in 4. Sent.

SECT. III. HAve you any Text, yea or yet pretext either of Scripture, or humane Tradition for countenancing this so prodigi∣ous and monstrous a conception? Certainely Scripture telleth us, that Christ his Body by Resurrection is perfected in Sense, and Agility; and his soule in Iudgement, and Capacity. Nor can you shew any Father in the Church of Christ, within the Circum∣frence of 1400. yeares after Christ, who held this your doctrine so much as in a Dreame; or who hath not esteemed the Bo∣dy of Christ to be of the most absolute perfection: we say no one Father, or Teacher of the Evangelicall Truth once fancied this un-christian, and false faith. {fleur-de-lys} No, no; your ownFran.

Doctor of Theology will tell you, out of Athanasius, (of many surnamed the Great) and out of Pope Leo (whom you your selves instiled Great, Both so intituled for their singular worthi∣nesse) who taught that Christ rose againe Perfest in his Bodie, So Athanasius. And that No infirmitie remained in him. So Leo. And addeth of himselfe, that All the Fathers were of the same Iudgement. If so, then were they directly Adversa∣ries to your prodigious Beliefe, except you will dare to say that Blindnesse, Deafenesse, and Senslesnesse are no Infirmities. Wee returne to the written word of God. When the Apostle, for the magnifying of the perfection of Christs glorious Resurrection, as the Head, by Analogy with the promised Corporall Glory of faithfull Christians, as his Members, by the virtue of Christs owne Resurrection, saith of these, Phil. 3. Hee shall transforme our vile Bodies, and make them conformable to his owne glorious Body, (namely) ac∣cording to those Celestiall Dotes and Indowments, set downe 1. Cor. 11. Incorruption, Immortalitie, Glory, Power. By all which the excellencie of the Corporall state of the Saints is delineated; whereby to excite all the faithfull to possesse
their bodies in sanctity, and to prepare them to Martyrdome, for the hope-sake of the glory, whereof it is said; The af∣flictions of this life are not worthy of the glory that shall be revea∣led. Wee suppose the Apostle could not then dreame of a Body of Christ, without facultie of Sense, or power of Motion. {fleur-de-lys} You must therefore derive this from him, whom Christ calleth the Father of lyes. Wee shall give you good rea∣son for this our Declamation. That this Romish Doctrine is Blasphemously Derogatory from the Majesticall Body of Christ. SECT. IV. WHat is this, which we have heard? Christ his humanity, after his Resurection, not to have so much Capacity as a Child; which is (as hee is here) to understand or imagine any thing done? not the power of a Moale, or Mouse; which is to heare, or see? not the faculty of a little Ant, so as to move it selfe? as if this were not an Antichristian Blasphemy against that all-Majesticall Body, and humane nature of Christ: which be∣ing once1. Cor. 15. 44 Sowen in Infirmitie, is (as the Scripture saith) since ri∣sen in power. Do you heare? In power, saith the Spirit of God, shewing that Infirmitie is changed into Potencie, in the Body of every Christian: and you have turned Power into infirmity, even in Christ himselfe, whom you have now transformed into an Psal. 116. Idoll having eyes, and seeth not, eares, and heareth not, feete, and walketh not, heart, and imagineth not: and yet this you professe to adore, as the person of the Sonne of God. O the strength of Sa∣tanicall Delusion? That this Romish Doctrine contradicteth your owne Principle. SECT. V. REmember yourSee above,  former generall Principle, which wee ac∣knowledged to be sound and true, viz. All such Actions and Qualities, which are reall in any Body, without any relation to Place, cannot be sayd to be multiplyed in respect of divers places, wherein a Body is supposed to be. As for example: The Body of Christ cannot be cold in one Altar, and hot in another, wounded, and whole, in joy, and griefe, dead, and alive at the same time. The reason. These are impossible (say you) because of Contradiction: for that the same thing should be capable of such Contrarieties, it is repugnant to the understanding of man. So you; which is an in∣fallible Truth, when the Modus, or Maner of a thing is compa∣red
to it selfe, and not to any thing else: it is necessary that at one and the same time the Modus be onely one, the same Jesuit can∣not be sicke in Iapan, and sound and in health at Rome, in the same instant. {fleur-de-lys} Take you, for a Conclusion, the Confession of your much approved Doctor, who doubteth not to call the opinion, which holdeth that [The Body of Christ is imperfect] to be Petrus Arcad. Corcyren. de Concord. Eccles. Occid. & Ori∣ent. Anno 1626. (Ap∣probantibus Episco∣po Bargi, Episc. Za∣cinth. Andraea Eude∣mone Ioh. & Docto∣ribus Facult. Parisien. Tract. de Eucharistia. Dicere corpus Chri∣sti esse quando{que} im∣perfectum, est mira blasphemia. Blasphemous, Nor may you deny the Disabilitie of Mo∣tion in Christs Body to be an Imperfection, seeing that, as the Head of your Church taught (that which all Christian, Chur∣ches ever professed) to wit,Innocent 3. Papa de offic. Mssae. lib 3. cap. 22. Quatuor sunt corporis glorifi∣cati propriae qualita∣tes, Claritas, subtili∣tas, Agilitas, & Im∣passibilitas. Agility is a proper of every glorified Bodie, wheresoever it is. And you may call to minde the Conclusion of your Iesuite Conincks above∣mentioned, (Cap. 4. Sect. 10.) Shewing that for the Same Body to be sayd to move in one place, and stand still in another, is as flat a Contradiction, as to say, It is frozen and warme both at once. Which hee confirmed (in the Margin) with seve∣rall Reasons, which do accordingly confute your Doctrine of Possibility of the voluntary Motion of Christs Body in Heaven, and the Impossibilitie thereof, as it is in this Sa∣crament. {fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. NOw say (wee beseech you) is there not the like Contra∣diction to make the same Christ, at the same time, as hee is in Heaven, Intelligent, and Sensitive; and as on earth, Ignorant, and Senslesse? Or Powerfull to move of himselfe on the Throne of Majestie; and absolutely Impotent, as hee is on the Altar? Because these Attributes, of Christ being Intelligent, and Potent equally, have no Relation to Place. Notwithstanding all which you shame not to professe a senslesse, ignorant, and feeble Christ. O come out of Babylon, and be no more bewitched by such her Sorceries.
CHAP. X. The sixt kind of Romish Contradiction against these words Of Christ [MY BODY,] as it is now most Glo∣rious, by making it most Inglorious. SECT. I.

So hee, at once relating, and rejecting their opinions. That the Indignities, whereunto the Body of Christ is made sub∣ject, by the Romish Doctrine, are most vile, and derogatory to the Majesty of Christ. SECT. II. ALl Christian Creeds tell us, that Christ our Saviour sitteth at the right hand of God, that is, in perfection of glory.

That the Romish fore-sayd Indignities are contrary to holy Scriptures, and Iudgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. III. HOly Writ teacheth us, that there is as great differerence betweene the Humiliation of Christ, when hee was on Earth, and his now Exaltation in glory, in Heaven, as there is be∣tweene shame, and Glory, it being now1.

Now for you to beleeve and professe the personall burning, devouring, regorging, yea and the hiding of that glo∣rious Body of Christ in a dunghill, and the like, are such exe∣crable speeches, as that wee stand astonished with horrour to heare them, thinking that wee have heard, in these, the scoffes, reproaches, and blasphemies of some Pagans against Christian Religion, rather than the opinion of any, that take to themselves one syllable of the name of Christians, If this had beene the ancient Faith, some Fathers doubtlesse upon some occasion, by some one sentence or other, would have revealed their Judgement therein: from whose diuerse and co∣pious Volumes neither do you allege, nor we read any one word of mans spewing up, or Mice eating, or so much as the Wind blow∣ing away the Body of Christ, much lesse of the other basenesse spoken of.

Which to affirme of Christs Body, were an Assertion abominable. {fleur-de-lys} Suffer us to aske you a question. When in the dayes of old (as youSee above Booke . Chap 2. §. 10. in the Challenge. know) the Remainders of the Sacrament were committed to the fire, tell us what that was, which was bur∣ned?
was it onely Bread and Wine? or yet the Accidents of them only? This you cannot say, whose Vniversall Doctrine is, that so long as the Formes of Bread and Wine are uncor∣rupt, the Body and Blood of Christ are Existent under them. Or ese was it the Body and Blood of Christ which was cast in∣to the fire? who will not abhorre to conceive such an Abo∣mination to have beene willingly committed by Sacred and Primitive Antiquity? and Consequently you ought to exe∣crate all beliefe of a Corporall Existence of Christs Body in the Sacrament, within the dents thereof. {fleur-de-lys} That the Romish Answeres, for defence of this their vile and beastly Opinion, are but false and fond. SECT. IV. IT was sayd of Philosophers of old that nothing was so ab∣surd, but some one or other of them would take in hand to de∣fend it: the like may be sayd of our Romish Opposites, whereof wee haue given you divers Instances throughout this whole Treatise, as in the most particulars, so for the point now in Que∣stion. And although many of your Disputers have for mode∣sties sake passed by it, yet have two among you (as it were put∣ting on Visards on their faces) come in with two fanaticall Card. Bellar. and Master Brereley in places above-cited. Answers. Both which are taken from the condition of Christ his humane Body, whilest he was in the World:Nonulli vix ferre possunt Chri∣stū quoquo modo in∣cludi in pavâ pixide, cadere in terram, cō∣mburi, rodi à besta—Annon credunt Chri∣stum parvulum in∣clusum in angustissi∣mo utero? eundem potuisse in via ca ere, humi jacuisse, & re∣moto miraculo à be∣stia morderi & com∣bui potuisse? si ita pati potuit in propria specie, cur mium vi∣detur si illa sine lae∣sione in specie aliena eidem accidere posse dicamus?

But Master Brerely more cunningly, that hee might not only disguise your opinions, but also make Protestants odious, (if it might be) for their exceptions against them, doth readily tell us, that Pagans, Iewes, and Heretikes con∣ceived Indignities against some mysteries of Christian Religion, as against Christ his Incarnation, and his Crucifying. So he. Both which Answers are but meere tergiversations, by confounding the two most different conditions of Christ: That, then in the state of his humiliation, with This, which is Now in the highest exaltation of Glory. Wee therefore rejoyne as followeth. Your Disputers have so answered, as if Christ his Incarnation in the Wombe of a Virgin, his Conversation upon earth, and his
Passion upon the Crosse were not objects of Indignity, notwith∣standing the Spirit of God, hath blazed them to the world to have beene the Indignities of all Indignities, Thus:Philip. 2. 6. Who being in the forme of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equall wih God, yet [] made himselfe of no reputation but tooke upon him the forme of a servant (such was his Incarnation) and became obe∣dient to death, even (spoken for aggravating the Indignity there∣of) The [shamefull] death of the Crosse. Than which never any thing could make more either for the magnifying of Gods grace, and mercy, or for the dignifying of Christ his merit for man, as it is written,Ioh. 3. 16. God so loved the World, that he sent his Sonne, (name∣ly to suffer) that whosoever should believe in him should not perish, but have life everlasting. How could your Aswerers but know, that it was not the observation of the Indignities, which Christ suffered, that wrought to the condemnation of Pagans, Iewes, and Heretikes: but their faithlessenesse, in taking such scandall thereat, as to deprive themselves, by their Infidelity, of all hope of life by Christ crucified. Hearken furthermore. That the state of Christ his Humanity cannot be now obnoxious to bodily Indignities; and that the Comparing both the Estates (in your answering) is unworthy the learning of very Catechumenists and Petties in Christian Religion. SECT. V. THis Disproportion betweene Christ his estate in the dayes of his flesh in this World, and his now present Condi∣tion at the right hand of God, is as extreamely disproportionable as is1. Cor. 15. Mortality and Immortality, Shame and Glory, Misery and Blessednesse, Earth and Heaven; that being his state of Humali∣ation, and this Contrariwise of his Exaltation, as all Christians know, and professe. And although the Body of Christ, now in eternall Majesty, be not obnoxious to Corporall injuries, yet may Morall and Spirituall abasements be offered unto Christ, as well in the Opinion, as in the Practise of men. Of the Opi∣nion we have an Example in the Capernaites concerning Christ, whensoever hee should give his Flesh to be eaten carnally: for the Practice you may  before you the Corinthians, who abu∣sing the Sacrament of the Lord did thereby contemne him, and were made guilty of high Prophanation against the glorious Body of Christ. And what else soundeth that Relative injury against Christ, by murthering his Saints on earth, complai∣ned off by his voice from Heaven;Act. 9. 4. Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou mee? Your Cardinall, in answer to the Objection of Indignity of∣fered
to Christ, by putting him in a Boxe, and of being Eaten with Wormes, and the like; opposed (as you have heard) saying, Why may not such things now happen unto him but [sine laesione] that is, without any hurt? Wee answer, that if he should suffer nothing in his humanity passively, to the Laesio corporis, that is, hurt of the Body; yet should there be thereby, in the opinion of men; Laesio dignitatis, that is, a lessening and obscuring of that his Dignity, which is set forth in Scripture, and which our Article of faith, concerning his Bodily sitting at the right hand of God in Heaven, teacheth us to be in all Celestiall glory and Majesty. This your Aquinas well saw, when in regard of Indignity hee judged itNesas nunc esset Christum in propriâ specie in pixi∣le includi putare. A. quin. part. 3. quaest. 76. art. 8. An hainous wickednes for any to thinke Christ should be inclosed in a Boxe, appearing in his proper forme. And what greater difference can it be for a Body to be Boxed under ano∣ther forme, more than when that one, and the same Person is knowne to be imprisoned, whether open-faced, or covered, whether in the day, or in the night, it mattereth not much, for still the same person is shut up in prison? Againe, if that these Circumstances now spoken of were not Arguments of Indig∣nity, why do your Jesuites, in a point of Opinion, deny that Christs Body is Transubstantiated into the flesh of the Commu∣nicant, because of theSee hereafter Booke 5. Chap. 7. §. . Indignity against his Majesty? Come wee to the point of Practice. Let this be our Lesson; when there is Reverence in the use of a thing, then there may be Irreverence, and Indignity in the abuse thereof. But your Church hath provided that the Priests Beards be shaven, and that the Laicks abstaine from the Cup, in a pretence of Reverence. The first, lest some part of the Hoast (which you beleeve to be the Body of Christ) should hang on the Priest's Beard; the se∣cond, lest any whit of Christs Blood in the Cup should be spilt. But how much more Indignity must it needs be, to be devoured of Mice, Wormes, and sometimes (as your owneSee above in this Book C. 2. Sect. 2. stories have related) kept close in a Dunghill? One word more. If these seeme not sufficiently indigne, because there is not Laesio corpo∣ris, Hurt to the Body, (this being your onely Evasion) what will you say of your framing a Christ unto your selves, who as hee is in this Sacrament, Is (you say) without power of motion, of sense, and of understanding? Why, my Masters, can there be Lame∣nesse, Blindnesse, Deafenesse, and Impotencie it selfe, without Hurt of the same party so maymed? &c. This is worse than your dirty imagination of placing him in a Dunghill.
{fleur-de-lys} A Vindication of the former Truth, against the palpably-Absurd (albeit amongst you, most plausible) Defence of your seeming Romish Absurdities, in Master Fishers Answer to KING JAMES, of Blessed and ever survi∣ving Memory. SECT. VI. HIs Tractate upon Transubstantiation, so greatly magni∣fied of the Romish Professors, is very large; wee shall draw his principall Points into a Compendium, which consist∣eth of two Generalls, and of divers Particulars. His two Ge∣neralls are his Position, and Supposition. Master Fisher his Generall Position, for Defence of Romish Absurdities, the Consequences of your Transubstantiation. Numb. 1. A Christian Catholike (saith he) Seeing in the doctrine of Transubstantiation, many seeming Absurdities that presse carnall Imaginations to the ground, growes more and more strong to believe them, imbracing these difficulties, as signes of that doctrine which was believed of the Primi∣tive Church.—And againe, The seeming Absurdities should rather incline a Christian to beleeve this mystery. Our Reply in Generall, to prove that his former Assertion may truly be termed FISHERS FOLLIE. For if the Absurder a thing be, it shall deserve a more be∣liefe; then the Pagans (of whom Tully could say, There is no∣thing so Absurd, which is not taught of some Philosopher, even to the affirming of Snow to be Blacke,) should be held to be more faithfull, than the best of Christians: and Heretikes, who have turned their Phantasticall dreames into Articles of Faith, should be judged to be more true Beleevers, than are true Catholikes. And sure wee are that, by this Position, the Jewish Rabbins, who taught the people to beleeve (in an implicit Faith) all their Doctrines, albeit it were to hold, his Left hand was his Right, should bee esteemed no lesse Faithfull, than the Papist, who by like Doctrine of blind Obedience have professed that Christ his Bodie, being in di∣vers Hoasts, taketh the Right hand and left hand of it selfe. And by the same Assertion shall Master Fisher thinke him∣selfe to be a better Catholike than were any of the ancient
Fathers, or yet any Romish Doctor, yea or than is M. Fisher himselfe, as will appeare in the sequele of our Reply. The second Generall is, Master Fisher his Supposition. Numb. 2. Master Fisher his Supposition is, That although the Ab∣surdities, which are imputed by Protestants to your Do∣ctrine of Transubstantiation, seeme to be such, Because they are not apprehensible by reason, yet are they therefore (saith he) the rather to be beleeved, notwithstanding whatsoever Impos∣sibilities that can be pretended. So hee. Our Confutation must be accordingly two-fold: The first in respect of Im∣possibilities, and the next of Indignities. Our Reply, displaying the Absurditie of Master Fishers Sup∣position in respect of Impossibilities, by the Generall Do∣ctrine of Fathers, Consent of Romish Divines, and by his owne particular Praevarication. First the Ancient Fathers, of the Primitive age, have una∣nimously professed a Doctrine of an Absolute Impossibility in all such things which imply any Contradiction, as you have See above in this B. 4. cap. 3. Sect. 2. & 3. heard; and maintaining this Doctrine of granting an Impos∣sibilitie in such Cases to be a Truth greatly magnifying the Omnipotencie and Almighty power of God; even by reason of Contradiction in them, which is an affirming and denying of the same thing. Concluding furthermore that gain-saying of Impossibilitie, in things contradictory, hath beene anciently The Sanctuary of Heretikes. So the holy Fathers. Secondly, all the Doctors of the Romish Schooles, of whatsoever Age, Sect, Society, or Denomination, have sub∣scribed to the judgement of those Ancient Fathers, in the same point of Impossibilitie, but why Impossibility? Because, say they, that such things are unconceivible in mans reason, and that they seeme Absurd, because of Contradiction. And hereupon have concluded of many Impossibilities touching a Body: as for example,See above c. 3. Impossible for a Body to be produced in divers places at once: Impossible for a quantitie of a Bodie not to possesse a place: Impossible for Christs Body, as in this Sacra∣ment, to goe from one place to another: Impossible for the same Bodie to be equall with a greater quantity: and many other more Impossibilities have they reckoned upon the same ground, that the Reason of man could apprehend nothing in such points but an implication of Contradiction. And now all these great pillars of Christianity, as well in the Vniversall
Church, Primitive, as in the now Romish, must, by Master Fishers former Assertion, be held to have beene no better than underminers of the Christian Faith, in that they did not Rather beleeve those things to be possible, even because they see∣med Impossible, by reason of Contradiction. Lastly, to come to Master Fisher his owne Praevarication: Mr. Fisher in his Answere to the  upon the seventh point, which is the ommunion in both kinds. How can the Body of Christ (saith hee) be without either Blood or Soule unlesse it were dead, and so should Christ be massacred in this Sacrament, and that Eucharist be a Bloody Sacrifice; and Christ glorious in Heaven, cannot say truly, that a Body voyd of Soule, Blood, and Sense is his Body: Yea as (Calvin himselfe confesseth) It is an Absurd maner of speech to terme Christ, the meere Bodie of Christ. So hee. Where∣upon hee will be found so implicated within the hores of a Dilemma, that hee cannot expedite himselfe: For say, good Master Fisher, should a Christian man (as you have sayd) the rather beleeve a Doctrine because it seemeth to be Absurd? (wee speake of sensible Objects) why then do you not beleeve these Absurdities, which you your selfe now do so utterly therefore condemne? But do you indeed condemne them, because they seeme impossible and Absurd? why then have you broached a Doctrine of Rather beleeving things, because of their seeming Impossiblities? So easie it is for a Patron of Absurdities to prove himselfe notably Absurd. Master Fisher his Generall Supposition, in respect of Seeming Indignities, happening to the Bodie of Christ, from the Doctrine of Transubstantiation. Numb. 3. As hee sayd of Absurdities in respect of Impossibilitie, so doth hee also argue from Seeming Indignities,condemning Protestants for arguing against Transubstantiation, because of Seeming Indignities: As in not conceiving Christs Bodie (saith hee) to be combined unto the Consecrated formes of Bread, and not to be polluted with such Indignities and Obscenities. So he. Our Reply. As though no other Indignities might be imputed to Ro∣mish Doctrine, except it were in such like Cases, wherein the Bodie of Christ should receive some Corporall hurt or pollution. There were, and are amongst the RomishSee Booke 5. cap. 7. Sect. 1. Professors, (and that no small Babes) who have taught a properly Mingling of Christ's Flesh, with the flesh of him that Communicateth of this Sacrament: and have beene Confuted by your owne Jesuites for the same Opinion, judging it to be Rash, Absurd,
and Repugnant to the Majestie of the Sacrament. Your Aqui∣nas (as you haveSee the former section. heard) held it an Hainous wickednesse for any man to thinke that Christ should be inclosed in a Boxe, ap∣pearing in his proper forme. Neverthelesse Master Fisher (as the Cat that covereth her excrement with dust) meant by this his former Answer to cover, or at least-wise colour your Romish Barbarous Indignities, in professing theSee Booke 5. cap. 7. Cleaving of Christs Bodie unto your guts, the vomiting of it, and a pas∣sable transmitting thereof unto the Seege, and other the like execrable Romish Indignites against the Body of Christ, so as the holy Fathers abhorred the very thought thereof. But wee chose rather to confute Master Fisher, by Master Fish∣er himselfe; who, in his Answer to Saint Augustine, (who called the Capernaiticall maner of Eating Christs Flesh Fla∣gitious) saith, that Saint Augustine excluded the grosse ima∣gination of Eating Christs Body in his proper Shape, tearing it in pieces with their teeth. Do you not heare? The opini∣on of Tearing Christs Flesh with mens teeth in his Proper Shape, he termed Grosse, or Absurd. Do you but now compare this his Confession with his former Assertion, which was, that wee are Rather to beleeve a doctrine, because it seemeth Absurd; and then try him when you please how hee will avoyd this Dilemma. Either ought Master Fisher to beleeve the Eating of Christs Flesh, in it's Proper Shape, or he ought not: If hee say hee ought, then must hee turne Capernaite, to beleeve the Body of Christ to be eaten with tearing it in pieces with mens teeth in it's Proper Shape, which hee himselfe disliketh as Grosse and Ab∣surd; and Saint Augustine abhorred as Flagitious. And if hee Answer that hee ought not, then is his former Position both Flagitious, Grosse, and Absurd, in affirming that A do∣ctrine is the rather to be beleeved, because it seemeth Impossible. From these Generalls, we passe to his Particulars and speci∣alls: to wit in his particular Exposition, Reasons, Inferences, and Confirmations, &c. Master Fisher his Particular Exposition of Christs words [This is my Body] as the Foundation of the former seeming Romish Absurdi∣ties, and Indignities. Hee thinking to qualifie all the Absurdities and Indigni∣ties, which necessarily follow upon your Romish Exposi∣tion of Christs words, as being the foundation thereof, in the First place insisteth upon Christs speech [This is my Body,] Why should Catholikes feare (saith hee) any hard
Sentence in respect of their prompt Credulity of Gods word ta∣ken in a plaine and proper Sense? So he. Our Reply, revealing the Absurdities both of the Romish Exposition, and of their Deduction of Transub∣stantiation from thence. His Defence is, that the Speech of Christ is to be inter∣preted in its plaine and proper Sense. Now whatsoever Relation the word [THIS] hath in Christ's Speech, it can∣not, without Absurdity, be taken in a proper and literall Sig∣nification, even by the Confession of your Romish Doctors themselves; as hath beeneSee Booke 2. cap. 1. plentifully proved. For if (as some of them affirme) the Pronoune [This  be referred to Christ's Body; as if Christ had sayd [This my Body is my Body:] This Exposition hath bin exploded by some Romish Doctors, of best note in your Church, expressely calling it an Exposition very absurd in Tautologie. And if the same [This] should betoken a Third thing, named an Individuum vagum, or confused Substance, (which is your Second Ro∣mish Exposition) this likewise hath beene scornfully reje∣cted by other of your Iesuits and Doctors, as an Interpre∣tation full of Absurdities. And lastly, if it shall be sayd to relate to [Bread,] as to be sayd [This Bread is my Body in a proper and literall Sense; All your Romish Disputers, with one Consent, abandon this also, as no lesse false, than for to say a Man is an Asse, or (as one of them feared not to write) to affirme Christ to be Iudas. And were it that Christ's Speech [This is my Body] were taken properly, yet the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, which you doe erect upon this foundation, would prove to be truly Absurd and Impossible, even by the Confession of your owne Romish Doctors themselves, who are, in their patronizing of your Article of Transubstantiation, distracted into two contrary Opinions; some saying that the Change, called Transubstantiation, is made by Production of Christ's Body out of Bread: Not so, saith the other Partie, holding this maner of Change asSee above, Booke 3. Chap. . §. 1. Absurd, as to affirme Christ's Body to have had any Existence, before Christ had spoken these words. The Second maner maintained by a later sort is a Change of Bread into Christ his Body, by Adduction of the Body of Christ unto Bread: No, saith the Former; Because this Change is but the changing of one Substance into the place of another, and therefore a Translocation only, and no Transubstantiation. Now all these Three Interpretations (and Three are all) together with your Two maners of Change of Christ's Body
thereby, being thus utterly rejected by your owne Divines; let us argue the Point with you upon these Premises. Either all your other Doctors, who have cashiered all the former Senses of Christ's Words, even because of Absurdities, had been Faithlesse; or else your Iesuit Master Fisher (which consequently followeth thereon) in concluding that your Romish Doctors are Rather to be believed, because they seeme to be Absurd, was no better than Fantasticall. Master Fisher his Particular Reason, for Defence of his former Exposition, as the Ground of Transubstantiation. Numb. 6. The Primitive Church (saith hee) preaching to Iewes and other Infidels the rest of the other Mysteries, as of the Trinity, and Incarnation; yet kept secret as much as might be the Knowledge of the Mysteries of the Eucharist: yea the Catechumenes and Novices before Baptisme were not fully instructed therein. And their Reason was, lest one should be scandalized, and the other mocked. This supposed, I inferre,&c. Our Reply, noting a double Errour in Mr. Fisher's Reason. His first Error is, that hee supposeth that The Primitive Church did absolutely conceale the Eucharist from Pagans and Catechumenists, and that more precisely than any other My∣steries; each of which areSee Booke 7. cap. 3. proved to be false. For neither could the Mystery of the Eucharist be sayd to have beene wholly concealed, which the Fathers both preached in their Sermons, and expressed in their publike Writings (as is to be seene in the Bookes of Iustine, Cyprian, and other Fathers:) nor yet can it be truly affirmed that they more precisely kept secret this Sacrament than the other Mysteries, seeing the same Primitive Fathers professed as strictly, that They durst not reveale the Sacrament of Baptisme either to Pagans or Ca∣techumenists, as they did the Sacrament of the Eucharist, as will be proved at large in the Seventh Booke. His Second Absurdity is to be seene in his Comparison (common to him with his fellowes) reasoning thus, that the Articles of the Trinity and of the Incarnation of Christ, are above mans Capacity and Reason, being onely to be appre∣hended by Faith, and therefore ought men to inthrall their Reason to believe what the Romish Church teacheth, con∣cerning the Eucharist, and not examine their Mysteries of Transubstantiation, which implyeth an Absolute Absence (in
this Sacrament) of the Substance of Bread, and an Existence of the Naturall Body of Christ. Whereas, indeed, there can∣not bee a more absurd Comparison; because the Mystery of the Trinity, and maner of Hypostaticall Vnion of the God-head and Man-hood of Christ, are Objects transcendently spirituall, and matters of Infinitenesse in themselves: but the matters of all Sacraments, are Corporall Objects of Sense, and therefore discernable thereby, and subject to the Examen of Reason, according to the Practice, andSee Booke 3. Conclu∣sions both of Primitive Fathers and Romish Doctors; Among whom your CardinallContarenus Cardinal. Tractat. de officio Ep. lib. 1. Dei cognitionem Sum∣mam appellat scien∣tiam divinae ignora∣tionis—Dei namque naturam longissim distare ab omni eo, quod intellectus no∣ster cogitat, necesse fuit quaedam de Deo credenda his propo∣ni, quae omnino men∣tis aciem superaret. Contarenus teacheth you out of Dionysius Areopagita, that our chiefe Knowledge of God is our Ignorance of him: because the knowledge of those things, which ought to be believed concerning God, differ from the know∣ledge of all other things, in this, that they excede all aprehen∣sion of mans mind. Master Fisher his Inference, upon his former Supposition. Numb. 7. This being supposed, (saith he) I inferre that the Seeming Absurdities of Catholike Reall Presence should incourage a true Christian mind to believe it, as to that which was be∣lieved in the Primitive Church, although accompanyed with so Seemingly Grosse Absurdities: as being of things above our Imaginations. So hee. Our Reply, noting the Absurdity of his Inference upon his false Supposition. The Supposition having beene proved to be false, con∣cerning the Doctrine of Primitive Fathers, his Inference from thence cannot be Really true: which wee shall now confute by the Sayings of your owne Doctors. For if Ro∣mish Doctrines, concerning the Eucharist, were therefore the Rather to be beleeved, because that they were accompanyed with Seeming Absurdities; then was it either Faithlesnesse or ex∣treme Folly in your owne Romish Divines, who reasoned Contrariwise (to give you Five Examples instead of five∣score.) I. Gabriel Biel against the Motion of Christ's Body in the Eucharist, from one place into another; and so to East and West both at once; which (saith he) wereSee above, Chap. . Sect. . Absurd and Ri∣diculous. II. Your Iesuit Coninks against the Possibility of Christ's Body to move and to be still, in the same Instant, gain-sayth it;Ibid. cap. Because that is (sayth hee) altogether Vnconcei∣vable. III. Pope Innocent against the Possibility of Christs Body to be Mortall and Immortall at once;See Booke 4. Chap. . Sect. . Because (saith hee)
it is Incredible. And IV. (as other of yourIbid. See the Marginells. Theologues in the same place do affirme) Because it is Repugnant to the Vnderstanding of man. V. Your Collius, Declaming against pretended Miraculous Issues of Christ's Blood out of the Eucharist, and sometime out of Images, impugneth it, say∣ing, Booke 4. Ca. 2. Sect. 6. & 7. Whose eares can abide to heare such a Copie and abun∣dance of Blood of Christ to be separated out of his Veines now after his Resurrection? yea, who without horrour can thinke thereof? He that beleeveth this, let him heare that notable Say∣ing of Solomon [Hee that is sodaine (or easie) of Beliefe is of a light and unconstant heart.] Nor could such Copie of Blood issue out, without some injurie to the Perfection of his Glorious Body. So they. Which Sentence of Solomon, if Master Fisher had truely had by heart, hee could never have held your Ro∣mish Doctrines to be the Rather Credible, because of their See∣ming Absurdities. Master Fisher his particular Romish Instances of Seeming Absurdities. Numb. 8. As for Example, I. That a Body so big should be in so little an Hoast. II. That a Body so Glorious should be sub∣ject to such Indignities and Obscenities. III. That the same Body should be in innumerable places at once. IV. That Bread being converted into the Body of Christ, the sole Acci∣dents should remaine, performing the office of the Substance even to the nutrition of mans Body. These Difficulties scan∣dalize Protestants, and thereupon they hold the Doctrine of Transubstantiation to be Absurd and Ridiculous, but wee must not depend upon our Senses. So hee. Our Reply, especially out of the Fathers, for Discovery of Master Fishers Falshood in pretending the Patro∣nage of Antiquity, for Defence of these Particular Romish Absurdities. Master Fisher, in his former Inference, pretended the Beliefe of the Primitive Church, as holding of Seeming Absur∣dities, as being things above Imaginations: and now insisteth upon your particular Romish Seeming Absurd Tenents, if they should be judged by our Senses; as though this had beene the Doctrine of Primitive Antiquity, whereas indeed he could not have done a greater injurie to the Church Primitive, which is ready to Contradict him in each Particular. The First objected Seeming Absurdity of the whole Body of Christ in so little an Hoast; or (as your Tridentine Fathers said)
In every least part thereof, was contradicted by SaintBooke 4. cap. 8. Sect. 6. Augu∣stine, holding it Incredible, as well as by some of your Schoolemen, who judged it Monstrous; and as much as to make the Nose of Christ to stand together with his Heele; and so to make his Body a ConfusedSee Booke 4 c. 8. Sect. Chaos. The Second, That a Body so glorious should be subject to such Indignites and Obscenities, was contradicted by all these holySee Booke 5. throughout. Fathers, who have gain-sayd The Eating of Christ with Teeth, The devouring with the Throate, and abhorred the passing it downe through the Entrails into the Draught, as vile and execrable Indignities. The Third, which is The being of the same Body of Christ in innumerable places at once. A Doctrine unanimously con∣tradicted bySee Booke 4. cap 6. Ancient Fathers teaching: I. Circumscription to be Inseparable from a Bodie: II. Proving thereby Christs Humanity to be a creature, and not God, because Circumscri∣bed in one place: And III. The Holy-Ghost to be God, and no creature, because not Circumscribed in one place. The Fourth, That Sole Accidents should remaine and nou∣rish mans Body; which one Instance followeth two false∣hoods: One is, to beleeve that Sole Accidents do remaine, without all Substance of Bread; contradicted bySee Booke 3. cap 3 12. Theodoret, your Pope Gelasius, and by other holy Fathers. The other Falshood is your professing, that Sole Accidents do nourish the Bodies, whether of Man or Mouse, (as you teach) But expresly contradicted by the Ancient Father Gregory Nyssen, who held it Impossible for any thing which is not a Substance to nourish a Substance. Lastly to his Additionall; That wee are not in the dis∣cerning of the matter of this Sacrament to depend upon our Sen∣ses; which is most Contradictory to the Doctrine of Anti∣quity; For the Fathers (besides these their AssertionsSee Booke 3. throughout. that we see Bread and Wine: the Bread which consisteth of granes of Corne, and Wine of Grapes) have justified the Judgement of our Senses in sensible Objects; and not this onely, but by the same Argument taken from our Senses, have furthermore confuted and confounded both the Heathen Academicks, and Hereticall Marcionites, Manichees, Eunomians, Euty∣chians, and others the most grosly Absurd Heretikes of those Primitive Ages. So that now you must conclude, that ei∣ther those Ancient Fathers ought to have submitted their Faith to those Absurd and damned Heretikes, or else Master Fisher ought to recant this his pernicious and Hereticall Pa∣radox of Beleeving Doctrines the Rather, because they seeme to be Absurd.
Master-Fisher his Particular Confirmation of one of his For∣mer Instances of a Body being in divers places at once, by a quaint example of his owne. Numb. 9. The Bodie of Christ (saith hee) being glorious, is as swift in operation as any Thought, but a mans Thought is so quicke, that one may be by Thought in two disjoyned pla∣ces at once, for example, in London and at Rome. Our Reply, detecting the Stupidity of this Objection. Wee (to omit that which is moreHe useth the Common Objection of Man's soule, and God himselfe, which hath beene confuted formerly. See above, cap. 6. Sect. 2. common) note in Master Fisher, now Objecting his owne fancy, not so much a Seeming Absurdity, as a palpable Stupidity in this his ex∣emplifying the Possibility of the Being of a Body in di∣vers places at once, as namely at London and at Rome. If Master Fisher thinking of Rome, at his being in London, should say that even then his Thought was Really at Rome; it were easie for any man to guesse in what place of London hee him∣selfe was; because that every Sober man will beleeve that Master Fisher, in thinking of Rome, had his Thought then in his owne Braine, and not at Rome. And though it should be pos∣sible for him to thinke both of Rome and London at once, yet could not this any way exemplifie the Possibility of the Being of one and the same Body in two places in one moment. For his Thought of London and of Rome are not one and the same Thought, but as distinct and different about the subject matters of his Thoughts, as namely the plotting of Treason in Rome, and practising and exequuting the same in London should be. Master Fisher his Particular Confirmation of the Possibility of Accidents to nourish a Substance, from a rare example of his owne. Numb. 10. It seemeth difficult (saith hee) to conceive that Accidents can performe the office of any Substance, as to nourish a man: But wee should perchance find as great a difficultie to beleeve (did wee not see it) Glasse to be made of Ashes: A Bird to be bred out of the rotten Barke of a Tree, &c. Our Reply, manifesting his Absurd Exemplification. This his Comparison of Likenesse (as any one may dis∣cerne at the first sight) consisteth meerely of unlikelihoods,
and Dissimilitudes; for he laboureth to prove it to be an e∣quall Difficulty for an Accident to nourish a Substance (as it is in his Examples) as for a Substance to nourish a Substance. The Absurditie whereof is no lesse, than for any to argue, that be∣cause the Body of a man doth beget a Body; So the shadow thereof can also beget a Body. It is irkesome unto us to have stayd so long in Master Fishers Absurdities, wee hasten to our Generall Challenge. {fleur-de-lys} THE GENERALL CHALLENGE, THese above specified Sixe Contradictions so plainly and plentifully proved by such forceable Arguments, as the light of Divine Scripture hath authorized, the profession of Pri∣mitive Fathers testified, Confessions of Romish Doctors acknow∣ledged, and the Principles of your owne Romish learning in most points confirmed; your Abrenunciation of your so many Grosse Errours may be as necessary, as your persisting therein will be damnable. Before we can end, wee are to consult with the Fa∣thers of the Councel of Nice, especially seeing that as well Roma∣nists as Protestants will be knowne to appeale to that Councel. CHAP. XI. Of the Canon of the Councell of Nice, objected for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ in the Eucharist; and against it. SECT. I. THis (as it is delivered by yourConcilij verba.

Cardinall, taken out, as he saith, of the Vatican Library) standeth thus: Let us not heere in this Divine Table, bend our thoughts downewards upon the Bread, and the Cup, which is set before Vs, but lifting up our minds let us understand by faith the Lambe of God, set upon that Table; The Lambe of God which taketh away the sins of the World, offered unbloodily of the Priest. And we receiving truly his Bo∣dy and Blood, let us thinke these to be the Symbols of our Resur∣rection. For this cause do wee receive not much, but little, that wee may understand this is not to satisfie, but to Sanctifie. So the Canon.

SECT. III. THis (as is propounded by your Cardinall) standeth thus. Per Agnum omnes intelligunt Christum, ut distin∣guitut contra symbo la, Bellar. quo supra.—Illi (Protestan∣tes) quasi admoneāt, nè quaerendum Chri∣stum in Altar lapi∣deo.

Ibidem per totum. All (saith hee) by the Lambe understand Christ as hee is distinguished from the Symbols and Signes upon the Altar. Next, But the Protestants thinke (saith hee) that the Councel admonisheth not to seeke Christ on the Altar, but to ascend up unto him in Heaven by faith, as sitting at the Right hand of God. But wee all say (saith hee) that the Councel would have us to attend unto the holy Table (meaning the Altar below) yet so, that wee see in it not so much the outward Symbols, and Signes, as that which lyeth hid under them, viz. The Body and Blood of Christ. So hee. The difference then betweene him and us is no lesse than the distance betweene
Aloft and Vnder, that is, between Heaven above, and Earth below. Let us set forward in our progresse, but with easie, and even pa∣ces; to the end you may better understand the strength of our Proofes, and rottennesse of your Objections. That the Nicene Councell is marveilously prejudiciall to your Romish Defence: proved by divers Observations; Three heere. SECT. IV. FIve Points are chiefly observable in this Canon. First is the nomination of Bread. Secondly, the mention of two Tables. Thirdly, the admonition to lift up our minds. Fourthly, the ex∣pression of the Reason thereof. Fiftly, the Confirmation of the same Reason. First, That, which the Councel would that men be not too intent unto, they call Bread after Consecration; for the Errour, which they would have avoyded, was either the too much abasing of this Sacrament (according to your Cardinals Iubet Con∣cilium ut non inhae∣reamus speciebus pa∣nis & vini; quasi ibi nihil sit, nisi quod oculi renuntiant. Bel∣larm. quo supra. Glosse) and then was it after Consecration; because they needed not to have perswaded any to have too meane an estimation of the Bread unconsecrated; (wch you your selves hold to be a com∣mon and prophane thing:) or else the Errour must have been, as indeed it was, too high a valuation of the outward Element of Bread, which must needs be so, because it was Consecrated, and notwithstanding it being so Consecrated, in the Canon it is called Bread. Which your Fathers of the Councel of Trent would not have indured, especially seeing that wee find that yourNic. Cabas∣las. Latini dicunt eos, qui panem & vinum nominant, & tan∣quam nondum san∣ctificatis precantur sanctificationem post illa verba [Hoc est Corpus meum,] rem supervacuam facere. Expos. Liturg. c. 29. Latine Church was offended with the late Greeke Church, for calling the parts of the Eucharist by the termes of Bread and Wine, af∣ter the pronunciation of these words [This is my Body,] by you called the words of Consecration. Besides they so call them Bread and Wine, as they name them Symbols and Signes, which proper∣ly they could not be, untill after Consecration. Secondly, the, &c—. Conc. Ni∣cen. Canon expresly noteth and distinguisheth two Tables, in respect of place; the one, as Here; being as much as to say, The Table: and the other opposed hereunto is instiled, That Table, I say. And now be it knowne, that [The Table here] which is not to be represented by the Antithesis of [But that Table] must necessarily inferre two distinct Tables; as, Here, and, There, doe prove two distinct Places: except one can make congruitie of these words [That Table Here.] Which I note, in Confutation of a vaine and crotchetive Objector. And, of this Table Here, the Councel forbiddeth Christians to looke Too attentively to the thing set before us: But contrarily, concer∣ning That other Table, they command men to Lift up their minds aloft. And not thus only, but they also distinguish them, in respect of their different Objects. The Object of the First
Table, Here, they name Bread, and the Cup, the Objects of Sense: And the other Object, opposed to this, is that on the other Table, expressed to be the Lambe God, the Object of our mindes. Thirdly, the Admonition or Caution, which the Councel giveth concerning the Bread, is, not to be too intent to it: but touching the Lambe Christ, they command us to lift up our mindes aloft; for so the world. [] doth signifie; not to be used (wee thinke) for an inward looking into the sublimiy of the mystery of the matter before us, as your Cardinall fancieth: but for looking up aloft unto the Lambe of God in Heaven, according to the Catho∣like Sense of those words,See hereafter, Book. 7. Chap. 4. §. 2. SVRSVM CGRDA. The next two Proofes out of the same Canon of Nice, to manifest our Protestant profession touching the Question in hand. SECT. V. OVr next two Proofes out of the Canon are these. First is their Reason of the former Caution: The Second, the Confirmation of that Reason: Both are expresly set downe in the Canon it selfe. Why then did those holy Fathers admonish us, not to be too intent to the Bread and Wine set before us? It fol∣loweth; Because they are not ordained to satisfie our Naturall man, namely, by a full Eating and Drinking: but for a Sacramentall participation of the Body, and Blood of Christ, to the sanctify∣ing of our Soules: whereas your Church doth attribute to that, which you eat in this Sacrament, a power of sanctifying the Bo∣dy by it's Bodily touch. But much more will the next Proofe un∣dermine your Defence. To confirme their Reason, why the Sacrament was not ordayned for the satisfying of the naturall man, they adde saying; For this canse wee receive not much, but little. Which one Clause most evidently proveth it to be spoken of Bread and Wine; and not of the Body, and Blood of Christ: as your generall Romane Catechisme (if you have not already learned it) will now teach you to believe, saying thatCatechis. Rom. Christum Dominum esse in hoc Scramen∣to non dicimus, ut parvus aut magnus est, sed ut substantia est. Tract. de Eucha. num. 36. Christ is not great or small in this Sacrament. And indeed none ever said of the Eucharist, that hee ate a little of Christ Body, or a little Christ; but yet the Sacrament eaten is sometimes more, some∣time lesse Nor this onely, but the Canon furthermore speaketh of taking a little of that, whereof if much were taken (saith it) it might satiate the naturall man. So the Canon. But that the out∣ward Sacrament can truely satisfie the naturall man, you your selves will testifie in your Booke-Cases and Missals,See Book, 3. chap. 3. §. 10. Chap 6. §. 1. & 2. acknow∣ledging men Drunke with the Sacrament, even unto vomiting with the one part thereof, and also making mention of Men, and
Mice being fed and nourished with the other. So then the natu∣turall man may be satiated with this Sacrament; but with what therein? The Body and Blood of Christ? you abhorre to thinke that, with Accidents? You may be ashamed to affirme it, as from the Jdgement of Antiquity, seeing you were never able hitherto justly to produce one Father for proofe of the Exi∣stence of Accidents without their Subjects: or of nourishing a Substance by meere Accidents. Wherefore untill you can prove some one of all these, give us leave to beleeve, that all were of the mind of that oneGregor. Nyssen. Quomodò enim res incorporea corpori cibus fiat? In Orat. de vita Mosi, p. 509. Fa∣ther, who held it Impossible for an Incorporeall, or not-Bodily thing to be food to a Bodily substance. And so much the rather, be∣cause the Fathers have manifoldlySee above, Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 7. & 10. &c. acknowledged in this Sa∣crament, after Consecration, the substance of Bread. Wherefore the Reasoning of the Councel, touching the Eucharist, was like as if one should say of Baptisme; Wee take not too much, but little, lest it might be thought to have beene ordained not for a Sacramen∣tall meanes of sanctifying the Soule, but for the clensing of the Flesh. None is so stupid as not to understand, by Much and Little, the substance of water; and not onely the Accidents thereof. And if you shall need a further Explication of the same sen∣tence of the Fathers of Nice you may fetch it from the Fathers in another Councel held at Toledo in Spaine, Anno 693. who shew this Reason, why theyConc. Tolet 16 Anno 693 Can 6. In∣tegrum panem esse sumendum—ne{que} grande aliquid, sed modica tantum ob∣lata, secundum id quod Ecclesiastica consuetudo retentat: cujus reliquiae aut ad conservandum mo∣dico loculo absque aliqua injuria Sacri∣ficijs confecrotur; aut si sumendum fuerit necessarium, non ventrem illius, qui sumpserit, gravis far∣ciminis onere pre∣mat, nec quid indi∣gesticè vadat, sed ani∣mum alimoniâ spiri∣tuali resiciat. Take little portions of the Hoast, (namely say they) lest otherwise the belly of him that taketh this Sacrament may be stuffed, and over charged, and lest it may passe into the Draught, but that it may be nourishment for the Soule. Hereby plainly teaching, concerning the consecrated matter, that were it so much as could burthen the belly, it would through the supersluity thereof goe into the Draught: whereas, if Lesse, it would serve as wel, or better for a Sacramentall use, to the replenishing of our soules in the spiritually receiving of the Body of Christ. But never was any of the Primitive Age so farre bereft of his wits as to imagine that Much, which stuffeth, and after passeth into the Draught, to be Christ's Bodie: and you may sweare that the Fathers meant not meereSee above Book 3. Chap. 3 §.  . Accidents; For meere Accidents have not the property of Substance, through the Muchnesse thereof, either to satiate the naturall ap∣petite, in feeding, or to overcharge the belly by weight, in pros∣sing it downe to the Draught. Never did any Father father such an Imagination. What can be, if this be not true reaso∣ning, and consequently a full confutation of your Romane Faith. Therefore this one Canon of Nice being thus undoubtedly gained, concerning he not seeking Christ, Here, on this Table, is sufficient of it selfe to batter downe your Assertion by a five∣fold force. First, by proofe of no Transubstantiation of Bread;
Secondly, no Corporall Presence of Christs Body; Thirdly, no Corporall Conjunction with the Bodies of the Communicants; and (consequently) Fourthly, no Proper Sacrifice thereof; and Lastly, no Divine Adoration due unto it. Therefore ought you to bid all these your Romish Doctrines and Delusions avaunt. Your Objections, from the former Canon, answered. SECT. VI. FIrst, youOb. 1.

Si autem sol esset animorum conjunctio, solus ani∣mus resurrecturus signific . Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 10. Object, that The Lambe is said to be placed on the Table, mistaking what Table is meant; for the Canon specifying two Tables, one Here, which is of the Eucharist, and another That Table, namely in Heaven, saith that Christ is placed on That Table, according to our Faith of his sitting at the right hand of God in Heaven. Secondly, hee is said (say you) to be Sacrifised by the hands of the Priest; which cannot be done, as hee is in Heaven. The words of the Canon, truly resolved, to cashiere this Objection, as thus: The Lambe of God set as that Table (namely in Heaven) is sacrifised by the hands of the Priest Here, to wit, on the Table below (repre∣sentatively) as hereafter the Catholike Fathers themselves will shew. And these two may easily consist, without any necessitie of the Priest reaching his hands as farre as the high∣est Heavens; as your Cardinall objecteth. {fleur-de-lys} The Priest (saith hee) hath not so long hands as to reach it in Heaven. So hee, delicately, and like a Romish Cardinall, carnally con∣ceiting onely a Touch, by the Finger, of Flesh, never re∣garding the Primitive Doctrine of Touching Christ by Faith, whereof first Saint Ambrose:Ambrosius in Luc. 24. Paulus docuit ubi te reperire possi∣, ubi ait; Si con∣surrexistis cum Chri∣sto, quae sursum sunt sape, non super terram. Ergo non quae su∣pra terram, nec in terra, nec secundum carnem te quaerere debemus, si volumus invenire. Nunc enim se∣cundum carnem jam non novimus Christum. Denique Stephanus non supra terram quae , qui stantem  ad dextram Dei vidit. Maria autem quae quaerebat in terra, tangere non potuit. Stephanus teigit, quia quae∣sivit in coelo. Many (saith hee) sought Christ on Earth, but could not touch him; But Stephen touched him, who sought him in Heaven. Consonantly Saint Augu∣stine; who to this Question, If Mary touched not Christ on Earth, what mortall man shall touch him in Heaven? Answe∣reth, Aug. tom. 10. de Temp. Serm. 152. Sin in torra positum Christum (Maria) non tangio, in coelo sedentem quis mortalium possit tangere? Sed ille tactus fidem significat. Tangit Christa, qui cre∣dit in eum. There is a Touch by Faith; hee that believeth in Christ, Toucheth him, {fleur-de-lys} Thirdly, you allege; Wee are said to partake truly of the Body of Christ. As though there were not a Truth in a Sacramentall, that is Figurative Receiving; and more especially (whichSee above c. 1. Sect. 2. hath beene both proved, and confes∣sed)
a Reall, and true participation of Christs Body ad Blood spi∣ritually, without any Corporall Conjunction. But it is added (saith hee) that These (namely, the Body and Blood of Christ) are Symbols of our Resurrection; which is by reason that our Bodies are joyned with the Body of Christ: otherwise if our Conjunction were onely of our Soules, onely the Resur∣rection of our Soules should be signified thereby. So hee, that's to say, as successesly as in the forer. For the word, HAC, These, (which are called Symbols of our Resurrection) may be referred either to the Body and Blood of Christ, immediately spoken of, and placed on the Table in Heaven (which wee Commemorate also in the Celebration of this Sacrament) and in that respect may be called Symbols of the Resurrection of our Bodies: because,See below Booke 5. Cap. . §. 1. If Christ be risen, then must they that are Christs also rise againe. Or else the word, These, may have relation to the more remote (after the maner of the Greekes) to wit, Bread and Cup on the first Table; because (as immediatly followeth) they are these whereof not much, but little is taken; as you have heard. Which otherSee below Booke 5. Cap. . §. 1. Fathers will shew to be indeed Symbols of our Resurrection, without any Consequence of Christs Bodily Conjunction with our Bodies, more than there is by the Sacrament of Baptisme; which they call the Earnest of our Resurrection, as doth also your Jesuite Ad futuram Resurrectionem, per Baptismi Sacramen∣tum, jus & pignus accepimus. Coster. in∣stitut. Christ. lib. 4. c. 4. [See more in the Booke following. c. 8. Sect. 6.] Coster call it The pledge of our Resurrection. (But this our Conjunction with Christ is the Subject matter of the fift Booke.) Lastly how the Eucharist, was called of the Fathers a Sacrifice, is plentifully resolved in theSee Chap. 5. Sect. 4. 5. & 6. sixt Booke.
THE FIFTH BOOKE Treating of the Third Romish Doctrinall Consequence, arising from your depraved Sense of the words of Christs Institution [THIS IS MY BODY] concerning the maner of the present Vnion of Christs Body with the Bodies of the Receivers by eating, &c. CHAP. I. The State of the Question. SECT I. A Christian man consisting of two men, the Out∣ward, or bodily; & the Inward, which is, Spiri∣tual: this Sacrament, accordingly, consisteth of two parts, Earthly and Heavenly: as Irenaeus spake of the bodily Elements of Bread & Wine, as the visible Signes and Objects of Sense; and of the Body, and Blood of Christ, which is the Spirituall part. Answerable to both these is the Double nourishment and Vnion of a Christian; the one Sacramentall, by communicating of the outward Elements of Bread and Wine, united to mans body, in his Taking, Eating, Disgesting, till at length it be Transubstantiated into him, by being Sub∣stantially incorporated in his Flesh. The other, which is the Spirituall, and Soules food, is the Body and Blood of the Lord, (therefore called Spirituall, because it is the Object of ) by an Vnion wrought by Gods Spirit, and mans Faith; which (as hath beene professed by Protestants) is most Reall and Ineffable.
But your Church of Rome teacheth such a Reall Vnion of Christ his Body and Blood with the Bodies of the Communicants, as is Corporall; whichSee below Ch.  Sect. . you call [Per contactum] by Bodily touch, so long as the formes of Bread and Wine remaine uncorrupt in the Bodies of the Receivers. Our Method requireth, that wee first manifest our Protestant Defence of Vnion to be an Ortho∣dox Truth. Secondly, to impugne your Romish Vnion, as Ca∣pernaiticall (that is) Hereticall. And thirdly, to Determine the Point by comparing them both together. Our Orthodox Truth will be found in the Propositions following. That Protestants professe not onely a Figurative and Sacramentall Participation and Communion with Christ's Body; but also a Spiritually-Reall. SECT. II. IN all the Bookes of our Adversaries written against Pro∣testants, they are most especially vehement, violent, and vi∣rulent in traducing them in the name of Sacramentaries, as though wee professed no other maner of feeding and Vnion with Christ's Body, than onely Sacramentall and Figurative. For Confutation of which Calumnie it will be most requisite to propose the Apologie ofCalvin. in his libris, viz.

Hacte∣n Calvinus. Him, who hath beene most oppo∣sed and traduced by your Disputers in this Cause, to shew, first, what hee held not; and then what hee held. If you shall aske Calvin what he liked not, hee will answer you, I. I do abhorre your grosse Doctrine of Corporall Presence. And II. I have an hundred times disclamed the receiving onely of a Figure, in this Sacrament. What then did hee hold? III. Our Catehisme teacheth (saith hee) not onely a signification of the Benefits of Christ to be had herein, but also a participation of the substance of Christ's flesh in our soules. And with Swinck∣feldius, maintaining onely a Figurative perception, wee have no∣thing to do. If you further demand what is the Feeding, where∣by wee are united to Christ's Body, in this Sacrament? hee tells you, IV. that it is Not Carnall, but Spirituall, and Reall; and so Reall, that the Soule is as truely replenished with the lively virtue of his flesh, by the powerfull worke of the Spirit of God, as the Body is nourished with the Corporall Element of Bread in this Sacrament. If you exact an expression of this Spirituall Vnion, to know the maner, hee acknowledgeth it to be V. above Reason.
If further you desire to understand, whether hee were not Singular in this opinion, hee hath avouched the judgement of other Protestants, professing not to dissent one syllable from the VI. Augustane Confession, as agreeing with him in judgement herein. Accordingly our Church of England (in the 28 Article) saith, that To such as worthily, & with faith receive this Sacrament. The Bread which wee breake is a partaking of the Body of Christ, which Body is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper onely after a spirituall and heavenly maner, the meane whereby as Faith. That the Body of Christ, by this Sacrament, was ordayned onely for food to the Christian man's Soule. SECT. III. WHat need wee seeke into the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, which are many, in this Point of Dispute, ha∣ving before us the judgement of yourSummus Sal∣vtor hoc Sacramen∣tum voluit esse tan∣quam spiritualem a∣nimarum cibum, quo alamur, & confor∣temur, viventes vita illius, quo dixit, [Qui mand ucat me, &c.] Concil.

THe soule of man being the most Essentiall and Substantiall part of man (because a Spirit immortall;) and the flesh of Christ being the most Substantiall of all food; and theréfore cal∣led, as of ancientAmbros. lib. 5. de Sacram. cap. 4.

which a Christian hath in his soules feeding, is the most Reall and true Vnion, as may sufficiently appeare by Analogie. To wit, that Bread and Wine being the most vitall nourishments, for the conservation of man's bodily Essence, are therefore cho∣sen (as the Fathers teach) to represent and exhibit unto him (although, in themselves, but Signes and Symbals) the very Bo∣dy and Blood of Christ. Therefore the Body and Blood of Christ are our Reall nourishments in this Sacrament. And such as is our food, such must be our Vnion, by feeding thereon; which wee say is by Faith, in this Sacrament; and you may not gain-say it, who, to comfort your Disciples, are Alanus & alij ex citatis Autho∣ribus dicunt, quando reipsa non potest sus∣cipi hoc Sacramen∣tum, ad perficiendam hanc unionem, suffi∣cere quod hoc Sacra∣mentum in voto sus∣cipiatur, quia hoc sa∣tis est, ut homo fiat membrum Christi vivum, & uniatur illi.

And this (you say) is To receive Christ his Body truely; albeit this be to receive him onely by faith and desire. So you. Whence you perceive our Infe∣rence, viz. If our Spirituall Vnion with Christ his Body may be really and truly made by Faith, and Desire, without this Sacra∣ment; then, in our Sacramentall Eating thereof, may the Communicant be much more made partaker thereof by Faith and ardent Desire; the Sacrament it selfe being a Sle of this our Christian Faith. CHAP. II. That onely the Godly-faithfull Communicants are Par∣takers of the Body and Blood of Christ; and thereby united to Christ; in the judge∣ment of Protestants. SECT. I. OVr Church of England in her 28. and 29. Article saith thus; The Body of Christ is given to be eaten in this Sacrament onely after a Spirituall maner, even by faith; wherein the wicked, and such as are voyd of faith, eat it not: although they do visibly presse with their teeth the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet are they in no wise Partakers thereof. But your Romish Church flatly otherwise, as you all know; and
therefore hath your Sympresbyter MasterMr. Brerely Tract. 2. §. 5. Sub 2. Brerely endeavou∣red to assume some Protestants to be on your side, whom hee hath alleged with like faithfulnesse, as hee hath cited Master Calvin: than whom hee could not have, in this case, a greater Adversary. For although Calvin grant, with all Protestants, that the wicked and faithlesse receive truly, by way of Sacra∣ment, the Body of Christ; yet doth hee deny that they have in their Bodies any Corporall Conjunction or Vnion with Christ, because the Vnion, which wee haveCalvin Epist. 372. yet in the same Epistie hee saith of Papists, Damnantur qui dicunt non minus corporis Christi par∣ticipem fuisse Iudam, quam Petrum.

It had beene good that your Priest had suspected his owne Iudgement, and (as well in this case, as others) by doubting his owne eye-sight, had borrowed yourSextum eorum pronunciatum est, Improbos non suscipere Corpus Christi, licet Symbola suscipiant.

So your Cardinall of the Doctrine of Protestants. For although, indeed, Calvin sayd that The wicked eat the Body of Christ; yet, explayning himselfe, hee added these two words [In Sacramento, that is, Sacramentally;] which in Calvin's style is taken for Symboli∣cally onely. As for the Consent of Protestants herein, wee put it to your great Cardinall and Champion, their greatest Ad∣versary, to expresse.Ex Vbi quitistarum opinione sequitur corpus Christi non posse vere manducari ore corporali, sed solum ore spirituali per fidem; est ipsisima sententia Sacramentariorum. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 17. §. Secundo ex. Hee joyneth Lutherans to the Cal∣vinists in one Consent, for denying the Orall and Corporall Ea∣ting thereof; and for believing the Eating of it Onely by Faith. Yet lest any may say, that, in receiving the same Sacrament, hee doth not receive the thing signifyed thereby; you may have a Similitude to illustrate your Judgements, as thus: The same outward word, concerning Justification by Christ, co∣meth to the eares of both Vnbelievers and Believers. But the Believers onely are capable of Justification.
That the wicked Communicants, albeit they eat not bodily Christ's Body, yet are they Guilty of the Lord's Body, for not re∣ceiving Spiritually, (namely) through their Con∣tempt, in not receiving the Blessing offered thereby. SECT. II. THe Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. 27. Whosoever (saith hee) Eateth this Bread, and Drinketh this Cup unworthily, hee shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord. And (vers. 29.) eateth and drinketh Damnation to himselfe, not discerning the Lords Body. Your Remish Professours (men not the least zealous for your Romish Cause) objecting this against the Protestants, call upon you, saying firstRhemists An∣not. in 1. Cor. 11. vers. 27. Here upon marke well, that ill men receive the Body and Blood of Christ, be they Infidels, or ill livers, for else they could not be guilty of that which they receive not. Second∣ly, That it could not be so hainous an offence for any to receive a piece of Bread, or a Cup of Wine, though they were a true Sacra∣ment; for it is a deadly sinne for any to receive any Sacrament, with will and intention to continue in sinne, or without repentance of former sinnes; but yet by the unworthy receiving of no other Sa∣crament is man made guilty of Christs Body and Blood, but here, where the unworthy Receiver (as SaintChrysost. Hom 60. & 61. ad Pop. Antioch. Chrysostome saith) do vill any to Christs owne Person, as the Iewes and Gentiles did, that crucified him. Which invincibly proveth against the Heretikes, that Christ is herein really present. And guilty is hee, for not ds∣cerning the Lords Body, that is, because hee putteth no difference betweene this high meat and others. So your Rhemists. Your Cardinall also, as though hee had found herein some∣thing for his purposeBellar. Ob∣ijcit Cyprian. Sterm. de Lapsis, de ijs qui post negatum Chri∣stum, sine poeniten∣tentia, accedunt; plus cos jam manibus at∣què ore delinquere, quam cum Domi∣num negrunt. De∣inde Cyprianum re∣censere miracula fa∣cta in vindictam eo∣rum, qui corpus Christi tantum vio∣lant. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 9. [See this answered in the 7. Sectio following.] fasteneth upon the sentence of Cyprian, who accounted them, that after their denyall of Christ presented themselves to this Communion, without repentance, to offer more injurie to Christ, by their polluted hands and mouthes, than they did in denying Christ▪ and besides hee recordeth Examples of Gods mi∣raculous vengeance upon those, who violated the Body of Christ in this Sacrament. So hee. All these points are reducible unto three heads. One is, that Ill men might not be held guilty of the Body of Christ, except they did receive it, as being materially present in this Sacrament. Next is the Guilt of prophaning this Sacrament, which being more hainous than the abuse of any other Sacrament, therfore the injury is to be judged more personall. The last, that the Examples of Gods vindicative Iudgemeuts, for Contempt hereof, have beene more extraor∣dinary: which may seeme to be a Confirmation of both the former. Before wee handle these points in order, take our next
Position for a Directory to that, which shall be answered in the sixt Section. That some Fathers understood the Apostles words, 1. Corinth. 10. Spiritually, (namely) as signifying the Eating of Christs Flesh, and drinking his Blood; both in the Old Testament and in the New. SECT. III. VPon those words of the Apostle, 1 Cor. 10. verse 4. [They ate of the same Spirituall meate▪ &c.] The Iewes received the same Spirituall meateAug. Tract. 26. in Ioh. sup. illa verba Apostoli, 1. Cor. 20. de fidelibus Iudaeis.

Item. Eandem quam nos escam; sed Patres nostri, (nèmpè fide∣les) non Patres illo∣rum. Aug. Ibid. saith Saint Augustine; namely they who were faithfull. Yea (saith yourAt eandem inter se; non nobis. cum candem Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 14. §. Quia. Cardinall) the Iewes received the same among themselves, but not the same with us Christians. So hee. Albeit the words of Augustine are plain∣ly thus; The same which wee eate: so plainely, that divers on your owne side doe so directly and truly acknowledge it, that your JesuitIudaeos can∣dem escam spiritua∣lem edisse nobiscum; exposuit hunc locum de Manna Augustinus, & qui eum secuti sunt multi; ut Beda, Strabo, & Author Glossae ordinariae—reprobatum hoc esse a posterioribus. Ego persuasum habeo, Augustinum, si nostra aetate fuisset, longè aliter sensurum fuisse, omni genti Hereticorum inimicissimum, cum videret Calvinistas ad eundèm ferè modum hunc locum interpretari. Maldon. Ies. in Ioh. 6. vers. 50. col. 706. Maldonate, not able to gain-say this Truth, pleaseth himselfe notwithstanding in fancying that If Augustine were alive in this Age, hee would thinke otherwise, especially per∣ceiving Hereticall Calvinists, (andCalvin. Instit. lib. 4. Cap. 14. Sect. 23. Eandem nobiscum—contra Scholasticorum dogma, quo docent, veteri lege tantum adumbrari gratiam, & novâ praesentem conferri. Calvin himselfe) to be of his opinion. So hee. Was it not great pity that Augustine was not brought up in the Schoole of the Jesuites! surely they would have taught him the Article of Transubstantiation, of the Corporall presence of Christ in the Sacrament, and Corporall Vni∣on; against all which there could not be a greater Adversary than was Augustine; whom Maldonate here noteth to have beene the Greatest enemy to all Heretikes: whomBertram. de Corp.

Aquinas in 1. Cor. 10. Aquinas also; The same (saith hee) which wee eate. Yea and Anselme imbraceth the same exposition, in the very words of Saint Augustine, The same which wee eat. Thus much by the way. Wee goe on to our Answers.
That the wicked Receivers are called Guilty of Christs Body; not by properly Eating of his Body unworthily, but for unworthily Eating the Sacrament there∣of Symbolically. SECT. IV. THE Distinction used by Saint Augustine (who is still a re∣solute Patron of our Cause) hath beene alwayes as gene∣rally acknowledged, as knowne, wherein hee will have us to discerne, in the Eucharist, the Sacrament from the thing repre∣sented, and exhibited thereby. Of the Sacrament hee saith thatAùg in Ioh. Tract. 26. Sacramen∣tum umitur a qui∣dam ad vitm  quibudam  exi∣tium: Re vero ipsa, cujus est Sacrament∣tum, omni homini ad vitam, null  mortem, quicunquè ejus particips uer. It is received of some to Life, and of some to destruction: but the thing it selfe (saith hee) is received of None, but to Salva∣tion. So hee No Protestant could speake more directly, or Conclusively for proofe; First, That, in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the Body of Christ is as well tendred to the Wicked, as to the Godly. Secondly, That the Wicked for want of a living faith, have no Hand to receive it. Thirdly That their not preparing themselves to a due receiving of it, is a Contempt of Christ his Body and Blood. Fourthly, and Consequently that it worketh the judgement of Guiltinesse upon them. {fleur-de-lys} If it shall be proved that the like judgement followeth upon the Wicked, for absenting himselfe from receiving of this Sacrament, in Contempt thereof; as well as it doth upon the unworthy Receiver, it Determinateth the Point in question, to prove the inconsequence of your reason, wher∣of you conclude, that the Guiltinesse of Judgement ariseth from unworthy Corporall participation of Christs Body, Now Saint Augustines words are, thatAug de Ne∣cessitate poenietiae. Tom 10. Hom. 50. Verset ante oculos Imago futuri Iudici, ut cum alij acedunt ad aliare Dei, quô ipse non accedit, con∣git quàm sit con∣tremiscenda illa poe∣na, qua percipinti∣bus alijs vitam aeter∣nam, alij in mortem praecipitentur aeter∣nam. Item  Tom 6. contra  Ma∣nichaeum lib. 13 c. 6. Qui autem mandu∣ca contemnit, non habet in se vitam, & ideo non pervent ad vitam aetenam. Hee that contenineth to eate this, hath no life in him, and shall be deprived of life eter∣nall. Which is by his Contempt, not in the Receiving, but in the Not-Receiving thereof. All which both the Evidence of Scripture, and Consent of Antiquity do notably confirme. For the Text objected doth clearely confute your Romish Consequence, because Saint Pauls words are not; Hee that eateth the Body of Christ, and drinketh his Blood unworthily, is guilty of his Body and Blood: but, Hee that enteth the Bread, and drinketh the Cup of the Lord unworthily, &c, Which wee have proved through∣out the second Booke to signifie Bread and Wine, the Signes and Sacraments of his Body and Blood, after Consecration. And (to come to Antiquity) All the Fathers hereafter cited, who deny that the wicked Communicants are partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ (albeit knowing, as well as you, that all such unworthy Receivers are guilty of the Body and Blood of
Christ) will thereby sufficiently confute your Consequence, which is, that because the Wicked are guiltie of Christs Body; Ergo his Body is Corporally present in them. But wee pursue you yet further. That a Guiltinesse of Contempt of Christs Body and Blood is to be acknowledged in all Prophane Neglect, even in not com∣municating thereof, by whatsoever person ca∣pable of this Blessed Sacrament. SECT. V. GVilty of the Lords Body:] that is, Guilty of the Con∣tempt thereof, as you well know. Now because Con∣tempt of a good thing is as well seene in a wilfull refusing to receive, as in a Contemptuous maner of Receiving; the Guilti∣nesse by the same Contempt must needs be against the thing of∣fered, whether it be Corporall or Spirituall; and Consequnt∣ly against the Giver himselfe. In which respect Christ com∣pareth the Refusers of the promises of the Gospell of Salva∣tion unto beastly Hogs, which trample under their feete Pearles of highest price, even because they would not beleeve them: Beleeving being our Spirituall Receiving. From the same Guilt of Contempt followeth the Obnoxiousnesse to punishment, de∣nounced by our Saviour;Luc. 9. 5. To shake off the dust of their feate for a testimony against them, in not receiving the Gospell of Peace. Therefore is that saying of Hierome common to every Sacra∣ment, Below Sect. 6. Contempt of a Sacrament (saith hee) is the Contempt of him whose Sacrament it is: As also that other of Rupertus, saying; Rupertus in Ioh. 6. Si quis existi∣mat illo Sacramēto se non egere, in eo ipso, quod manducare & bibere contemnit, quantumvis Catho∣licae professionis ho∣mo sit, a Societate membrorum Christi, quae est Ecclesia, se praecidit &c. The not receiving the Eucharist (if it be in Contempt) doth separate the Contemner from the society of the members of Christ. Hence it was, that whereasQuemadmo∣dum enim accedere frigidè []—sic non communi∣care de istis [▪] Chrysost. in 1. C. 0. Hom. 24 Chrysostome called mans Ind∣votion in receiving the Eucharist Dangerous, hee named the Contempt of Not participating thereof, Pestilence, and death it selfe. But not to presse you further with other such like speeches of the Fathers, wee shall referre you to your Divines of Collen, who in their Councel censured those, who Contemptuously refused to Communicate of this Sacrament, to be butConc. Pro∣vinciae Coloniense fol. 29. Cap. 14. Qui non  hunc pa∣nem vitae, qui de coe∣lo descendit, accipere desideant, homines solo nomine Christi∣ani sunt, Capernaitis deterioes, etiam vo∣luntariè in filium Dei peccantes,  Copori Dominico & sangui∣ni contumeliam infe∣rentes terribilis quae∣dam expectatio j∣dicij manet. only in name Christians, worse (say they) than the Capernaits, offering Contumely (marke wee pray you, against your Rhemists) to the Body and Blood of Christ; and are made thereby Obnoxious to the terrible judgement of God. A Conclusion, whereby is satis∣fied, from your owne Doctors, your owne maine Objection, even in Terminis terminantibus, as the Schoole speaketh: pro∣fessing both mans Guiltinesse of Christs Body in not receiving this Sacrament, and Obnoxiousnesse thereupon unto Gods
judgement; as also hath beene evinced by the Judgement of S. Augustine, in the former Section. As for the objected speech of SaintObjected by Bellarmine above §. 2. Cyprian it is of asie disgestion, because Comparisons of Magis, and Minus, (as lear∣ning teacheth) are altered upon all different respects. Some in persecution denyed Christ, in the extremity of their feare; and some in their wilfullnesse prophaned the Sacrament of the Eucharist, instituted by Christ. This latter is the greater sin∣ner before God, who judgeth sinne not onely Secundum actum, aut effectum, according to the wicked deed done; but Secun∣dum Affectum, that is, but much more according to the De∣praved Affection▪ and Disposition of the mind of the Doer. In which respect wee may well thinke that Iudas his traiterous, and scornefull Kisse was more hainous than Peters perjurie. Have you not read what the Apostle hath written against such as Apostate from their Faith, and vow of Baptisme, saying,Hebr. 6. 6. They Crucifie unto themselves the Sonne of God? which is much more than Cyprian spake of the Guilty Receiver of the Eucharist; yet dare not you conclude that therefore there is a Corporall pre∣sence of Christ in the Water of Baptisme. And as in the Guilt of sinne; so is it in the Guilt of punishment also, which followeth sinne, as a shadow doth a Body. In which consideration Au∣gustine doth parallell Baptisme, and the Eucharist together, say∣ing, Aug. lib on∣tra Fulgent.  Sicut qui mandu∣t, & bibit sangui∣nem Domini indignè, judicium sibi mandu∣cat & bibit. Sic qui indignè accipit Bap∣tisa, judicium sibi accipit, no salutem. As hee that drinketh the Blood of the Lord unworthily drinketh his owne judgement: So doth hee who receiveth Baptisme unworthily. By these Premises you will furthermore easily discerne, that you other Romish Doctors have beene no lesse ignorant than they were arrogant, in concluding it to be an Infallible Conse∣quence, that because Christ receiveth an injury in his Body and Blood, by the abuse of the Sacrament of the Eucharist; therefore his Body and Blood is Corporally present therein. As if they would teach, by the like Inference, that because the Empresse Contumelia illata imagini, ad personam repraesen∣tatam pertinere cen∣setur. Nota est histo∣ria Theodo si, de vindicta quam in Antiochenos exer∣cuit, propter dejectam Imperatcis imagi∣nem Niceph. lib. 13. Hist. c. 43. Teste Sua∣rez Ies Tom. 1. in 3. Thom. Disp. 4 §. 3. Eudocia was (as is confessed) reproached by the Citizens of Antioch, in their despight wrought upon her Image; therefore was shee personally present in the same Image. Yea and your selves, when you plead for the Reverend use of Images, can be content to take your reason from theNon enim le∣vem injuriam seculi Principes sibi puta∣bunt illatam in quo∣libet numismate a Subjectis despici no∣verint & calcari. Spe∣culum antiquae devo∣tonis circa Missam, a Ioh. Coclo, ex Wal∣frido. Cap 8. Example of Kings or Princes; as being injured by the abuse of their pictures. You seeme to be zealously bent against all unworthy usage of this oly Sacrament; it is well; yet were it better that you saw your owne Guiltinesse to repentance: Forasmuch as every one is an Vnworthy Receiver (in the judgement of SaintAmbros. in 1. Cor. 11. Indignus est Domino, qui aliter mysterlum celebrat, quam ab o traditum est. Am∣brose) who doth celebrate it otherwise than was appointed by Christ himselfe. Your Ten Transgressions of Christ his Institution in this Sacrament (discovered in the First Booke) convinceth you of a Ten-fold Guiltinesse of the Vnworthy Receiving of this
Mysterie. Your last Objection of Guiltinesse hath beene ta∣ken from the Executions of Gods punishments. Wee there∣fore rejoyne. That the Examples of Gods Vindicative Justice have appeared against the Contemners of many holy things, without respect to the Corporall presence of Christ therein. SECT. VI. COme wee to the open judgements and punishments of God, upon the Contemners of this Sacrament, The visible Testimonies of his Justice, and Arguments of the preci∣ousnesse and holinesse of this Mysterie. These wee beleeve to be true, And the Apostle hath made it manifest, where (speaking of the great plague, which fell upon the Corinthians, who had prophaned this Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ) hee pointeth this out as their sinne, saying,1. Cor. 11. vers▪ 0. [Ob hanc causam] For this cause are many sicke among you, and many sleepe, &c. Yet was not this for no Discerning the Body of Christ to be Corporally in the Eucharist (as your Disputers pretend:) but (to use SaintHier. in 1. Cor. 11. Reus erit Corporis & sangui∣nis Christi, qui tanti mysterij Sacramen∣tum pro vili despee∣tit. Hieromes words) They were guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, because they despised the Sacra∣ment of so great a Mysterie; (namely) by their prophane beha∣viour at their receiving thereof, as if they had beene at the Heathenish Bacchanalls: or, as Primasius yeeldeth the Cause, Primas. in und. locum. Quia ac∣ciperent quasi cibum communem. For that they tooke it as homely, as their common bread. {fleur-de-lys} And why should you conceive that to be singular in this one Sacrament, which Saint Hierome teacheth to be com∣mon in all other?Hier. Com. in Malach. c. 1. Dum Sacramenta violan∣tur, ipse cujus sunt violatur. When the Sacraments (saith hee) are violated, hee, whose Sacraments they be, is violated and vilified. {fleur-de-lys} All can point at the dolefull Example of Gods vengeance upon Iudas, the first unworthy Receiver; and therefore the sub∣ject of the first Document of Gods judgement, notwithstan∣ding that hee received but the Sacrament onely, and not the very Body of Christ, as Saint Augustine observed, saying; See after in Sect. 10. Hee received not the Bread, the Lord, but the Bread of the Lord. And how justly may wee thinke, did God punish certaine Optatus lib. 2. Donatists, who casting the holy Sacrament to Dogs, were themselves devoured of Dogs? Neither have these kindes of Gods judgements beene proper to the Abuse of this Sacrament onely, as you have instructed men to believe; for looke into the sacred story, and you shall find the men of1. Sam. 5. Ashdod, for modling with the Arke of God, afflicted with Emrods: the men of1. Sam. 6. Bethshemesh smitten with a great slaughter, for but peeping

And yet was there not any peculiar existence of God in these Things.2 King. 2. Boyes are mocking Gods rophet in Bethel, by noting him for a Bald pate, and are de∣vored by Beares. ThNumb. 11. People loathing Manna, are choaked with Quail. If sacred stories will not prevaile, peradventure your owne Legends will rellish better with you: so the yourQuidam, qui sancti Anthonij I∣maginem abolere cupiebant, non tule∣runt illud scelus im∣pune, sed è vestigio peste illa, quae dicito Antonij, correpti in∣terierunt. Bozius de signis. Eccles. lib. 15. c. 12. ex Lindano. Bozius will tell you of them, who were suddainly strucke with the plague, called Saint Anthonies plague, one by for seeking to pull downe and demolish Saint Anthonies Image. Have you faith to believe this? and can you not conceive a like right Judgement against the Prophaners of the Sacramentall Image of Christ him∣selfe? Be it therefore furthermore knowne unto you, that the Sa∣crament, which is celebrated by Protestants, although▪ it con∣teine no Corporall Vnion of the Body of Christ, yet is it not so Bare Bread, as your Doctors have calumniously suggested unto you, but that God hath manifested his Curses upon pro∣phane Communicants and Contemners of this holy Mystery, which hath in it a Sacramentall Vnion of the Body and Blood of Christ. One example, whereof wee reade, is of one that being afflicted in Conscience for his abuse of the Sacrament, in receiving it but in one kind,Manlius lo∣corum Communium Collect. Minister cu∣jusdam Sartoris Lip∣siae, Anno 1553.

Did cast himselfe head-long out of a window, and so dyed. The other is that which hee (who now writeth these things) saw and can testifie, viz. Sir Booth of S. Iohn's Coll. in Cambridge. A Bachelour of Arts, being Popishly affected, at the time of the Communion, tooke the Consecrated Bread, and forbea∣ring to eat it, conveyed and kept it closely for a time; and af∣terwards threw it over the walls of the College: but a short time after, not induring the torment of his guilty Conscience, hee threw himselfe head-long over the Battlements of the Chap∣pell, and some few houres after ended his Life.
That onely the Godly Christians are partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ, and thereby Vnited unto him, is not Contrary to the Iudgement of Ancient Fa∣thers, as is Objected. SECT. VII. YOur Doctor hath performed great diligence in collecting Sentences of Ancient Fathers, sounding to the Contrary, out ofDr Heskias in his Parlia. of Christ.

That hee that drinketh the Blood of the Lord unworthily, drinketh Iudgement unto him∣selfe. So your Doctor. Wee shall helpe him with ano∣ther Testimonie ofAug. lib. 5. de Baptismo. Chap. 8.

Apostolus ait, [Qui edit indigne, Reus est corporis Domini.] de ijs di∣ctum, qui corpus Do mini velut quem libet cibum sumebant, &c. Augustine, that Iudas sinned in wic∣kedly receiving the Body of Christ. But (not to usurpe in this place the Answer of your owne Doctors unto the Ordinary speeches of Chrysostome in his Homilies noting his Rhetoricall Hyperboles) wee answer directly from Saint Augustine him∣selfe, who hath already told you, that the calling Bread the Body of Christ, is not spoken in the strictnesse of the truth of the thing, but in a Mysticall Signification, that is (said your owne RomishSee above . 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 5. Glosse) unproperly. The same Answer may serve for the Objected place of Cyprin de Coena Dm Sacra∣menta quidem quan∣tum in se sunt, sine propria virtute ese non possunt, nec ullo modo divina maje∣tas absentat se my∣sterijs, sed quamvis ab indignis se sumi & contingi Sacra∣menta permittant, non possunt tamen spiritus esse partici∣pes quorum infideli∣tas tantae sanctitu∣dini contradicit. And a  after; Sicut corporea natura substantiâ potus & esu: ita vita spiritus hoc proprio ali∣mento nutritur A little before; Haec mer alijs odo viae in vitam, alijs mortis in mortem, quia omno justum ut tanto priventur beneficio graae contemptores Objected by Dr. Heskins in his Parliament of Christ. B. 3. c. 49. Cyprian, wherein furthermore wee find a cleare Distin∣ction, betweene the Being of Christs Body Sacramentally in the Eucharist, (together with the Receiving thereof) and it's Being Spiritually; Concerning the Sacramentall virtue (namely the thing signified) which is ministerially offered to every Communicant, in every Divine Sacrament; but that this should be effectuall to any Communicant, it is ne∣cessary that his Receiving be Spirituall. For Grace is the virtue of Baptisme to every Person baptized; yet (accor∣ding to the termes of Schooles) Hee, who either by his Infi∣delity, or Impenitency shall Obicem ponere, that is, set a
Barre, and resist that Grace, hee doth not receive it. A man that receiveth with his hand a politike Instrument, and Scale offered unto him, yet if hee yeeld not his Consent to accept of the Guift it selfe, therby conveyed, and in the ma∣ner that hee ought; it may well be sayd, that the thing thus bequeathed is really tendered, yet in respect of the Parties Contemning it, although it be touched and taken after the publike and Civill touch, yet notwithstanding is hee not partaker thereof: For which Cause it is added in Cyprian, that These are therefore the Savour of Life unto Life, to some; and the Savour of Death unto the Contemners of them; which, as the Scripture teacheth, is common to the preaching of the Word of God likewise. Besides, do you not marke tha Cy∣prian speaketh of [Sacramenta, Sacraments,] in generall: But you haveSee above . 1. c. 3. §▪ 6. at  told us, that the two parts of the Eucharist, make but One Sacrament, and then may you, by the same Alchymie, as well extract a Corporall Presence of Christ out of Bap∣tisme, as out of the Eucharist. That the Vngodly do not Communicate of Christs Body in Re∣ceiving the Eucharist, is the Determinate Iudgement of Antiquity, and Consequently argueth a No-Cor∣porall presence of Christ, as an Vnion with him in the Eucharist. SECT. VIII. AFter that you have heard the Symbolicall Phrases of the Fathers, so Dissonantly objected for proofe of a Bodily Presence of Christ in the Eucharist; Hearken, I pray you, to their accurate and Determinate Resolutions, to the Contra∣ry. The Fathers (in the Margin) deliver their Judgements sometime in an Affirmative locution, concerning each true Communicant and partaker of Christs Sacred Body and Blood, saying of every such a one, thatIrenae ad∣versus Haeres▪ lib. 5. confesseth, Caro san∣guine Christi nutrita membrum ejus est. Hee is a mem∣ber of Christ. So Irenaeus. AndCyrill. Alex. in Ioh lib. 11. c 26. Vnio haec, per quam nos inter nos, & omnes cum Deo conjungimur. Et l. 4. c. 10. Qui edunt pa∣nem viae immorta∣litatem consequun∣tur Et lib. 10. c. 13. Christum in nobis habitatuum. Hee that eateth this Bread of life is joyned with Christ, and Christ dwelleth in him. So Cyrill. AndOrigen. in Matth 15 Verbum cao factum est, quem bum qui co∣medit vivet i aeter∣num, quem nullus malus potest come∣dere, alioqui scriptum non esset, qui edit, vivet in aeternum.

It is living Bread, which who so eateth, liveth everlastingly. So Ambrose.Chrysost. Hom. 61. ad. Pop. Antioch. Tradit unonem ra∣tione cujus dicuntur membra Christi. The Vnion is that whereby the Eaters are sayd to be the members of Christ. So Chrysostome. Sometime more Emphatically, in a Nega∣tive style,Origen. vide paul sup. Origen, No wicked one can eate this meat. As also Hierome,Hironym. in Malac. Sordidi mundum sanguinem bibunt. [namely Sacramentally, for the signe of his Body, who himselfe, in lib. 1. contra ovianum cal∣leth it, Typus sanguinis; And againe in Isai 66. speaking conclusively, saith, Omnes qui non sunt sancti spi∣itu & corpore, non comedunt carnem nec bibunt sanguinem eius. All that are not holy, do not eate Christs
Flesh or drinke his Blood. Wee reserve Saint Augustine for a peculiar Section, and our reason is, because your Dispu∣ters do so earnestly struggle to draw him to your part; but yet most vainely and unconscionably, as will appeare in the Section following. Now whether side, yours, or ours, can more satisfactorily reconcile the seeming Contradictions of the Fathers, in say∣ing and gain-saying the Eating of Christs Flesh by the Wick∣ed, it will stand with equity and good Conscience, that they may carry the Cause. Your All-answer, and the An∣swer of you All, is by Distinction, saying, that The wicked eate the Body of Christ Corporally in this Sacrament, by a Bodily Touch; but they eate it not Spiritually: for they eate it not wor∣thly, and in that respect are said not to eate it. So you. As if the Fathers, in denying the Wicked to be partakers of Christs Flesh, must have meant that they Eate it not wor∣thily. But this Distinction cannot possibly accord with your owne Romish Faith, which teacheth a Bodily Eating, with a Bodily Touch by a Bodily. Vnion of the Eater with the Body of Christ, common as well to Iudas, as to Peter; to the Pro∣phanest miscreant, as to the Godliest Saint: yea to the very Beasts, as really as to Men. If this had beene the ancient Catholike Faith, then could not these Fathers so peremptorily and precisely have deny∣ed, that any Wicked is joyned and united with Christs Body, and especially when they mention in expresse termes a Naturall and Corporall Conjunction of Christs Body with the Bodies of the Communicants, by this Sacrament; which you your selves interpret to be spoken of your Corporall Vnion by a Bodily Touch; nor would Origen give this his absolute [Non posse,] The Wicked cannot (saith he) be partakers of the flesh of Christ, which is implyed in the Sayings of the rest of the Fathers, when they speake so universally of the True Eater of Christs Body,See above in this Sect. n. 11. &c. That every such are joyned with him to Immortality. Whereof somewhat more hereafter. But our Protestant Distinction, for reconciliation-sake, is, that the Fathers, in affirming The Wicked to eat the Body of Christ, spake onely Symbolically, to wit, as they called the Sacrament of Christs Body, the Body of Christ, Sacramen∣tally and Figuratively (as hath beeneSee Booke 2. thorowout. copiously and convin∣cingly proved;) So do they affirme the Body of Christ to be Eaten of the Wicked, that is to say, Symbolically, by eating onely the Sacrament of his Body: But in affirming that the Godly onely eat Christs flesh, they spake of the Spiritually-Real Eating by Faith, which was the maner and meanes Spirituall of being truly Vnited to Christs flesh, and so to his person, God and man; and so, as his lively members, made Capa∣ble
of Immortality it selfe, as well in Body, as in Soule. This our Distinction, wee have received from Saint Augu∣stine, for whom both you and wee strive, as for the Homer of his age, and Patron of our Faith in this Point, which is to be tryed in the Section following. In the Interim, you (who so earnestly plead against this privilege of the Godly to be partakers of Christs Body, by making the Wicked to be as Capable thereof, as any Sancti∣fyed member of Christ can be) thinke but with your selves, how that Satan is sayd to have entred into the heart of Iudas, after his receiving of this Sacrament; and then tell us, if the Wicked be really partakers of Christs Body, and not to Contradict that Scripture, which denyeth that there can be any Communion with Christ and Beliall; yet will you inferre (in Iudas,) a Communion betweene Christ and Satan. That Saint Augustine (to whom both sides appeale) is a Direct Patron of our Protestant Cause, for proofe, that the Wicked eat not the Body of Christ: And Consequently an Adversary to the Romish Faith of a Corporall Presence in this Sacrament; noting also an egregious Depravation of a Testimony of Saint Augustine, by a Ro∣mish Doctor. SECT. IX. YOu allege, and wee as willingly acknowledge, that Saint Augustine said, that the Wicked, (and among others, even Iudas,) doe eat the Body of Christ; which hee meant (say wee) Metonymically and Figuratively, in as full a sense as if hee had flatly sayd, The Wicked eat onely the Sacramen∣tall Signe of his Body, because hee spake so, onely [Sacra∣mento tenus] that is Sacramentally. Which Distinction, as oft as it is seriously used by us, is as scornfully rejected by you: and therefore it will be requisite, that wee produce some Author hereof; who may be beyond all exception: And none, thinke wee, rather than Saint Augustine himselfe, especially seeing that your Disputers do collect Testimonies out of him, in prejudice of this our defence; which is, that Saint Augustine denyed, that the Wicked receive the Body of Christ properly but onely the Sacrament thereof. There were Prophane Spirits in the dayes of Saint Au∣gustine, who pampering themselves in their vices, notwith∣standing presumed of Salvation, because of their professing of the Catholike Faith, and of their being the Members of
Christs mysticall Body, which is his Church, and Conclu∣ded thereupon, That they, in communicating of this Sacrament, eat not onely the Sacrament, but indeed the Body of Christ. These SaintAug. lib. 21. de Civitate Dei. cap. 25. Respondemus ijs, qui salutem promittunt ijs, qui Baptismate abluti & corporis & sanguinis Christi par∣ticipes facti, quomo∣dolibet vixerint, in quacun que haeresi & impietate uerint. Respondendum est etiam ijs, qui hanc liberationem polli centur, solis Catho∣licis, quamvis malè viventibus; qui non solo inquiunt Sacra∣mento, sed reipsa manducaverunt cor∣pus Christi, in ipso scilicer eius corpore constituti, de quo di∣cunt Apostoli, unus panis, unum corpus, multi sumus. [At the end of the Chapter hee concludeth against these from the nature of Truly Eating this Sacrament] Nec er∣go dicendi sunt man∣ducare corpus Chri∣sti, quoniam nec in membris computan∣di sunt, quia non pos∣sunt esse membra Christi, & membra meretricis: Christus dicit, Qui manducat meam arnem, & bi∣bit meum sanguinē, in me mane, & ego in eo, Ostendit, quid sit, non Sacramento tenus, sed revera manducare Corpus Christi, manducare, hoc est, in Christo manere—non au∣tem in eo manet, qui non est membrum Christi. Augustine confuteth at large, instancing in the Eating of Christs Body, saith First, that They cannot be sayd to eat the Body of Christ, who are not to be reputed the mem∣bers of Christ: But are then the Wicked to be esteemed, by Saint Augustine, the Members of Christs mysticall Body? Saint Augustine himselfe saith no, and proveth as much from the Apostles words, [You cannot be the members of Christ, and the members of an Harlot.] How then are they sayd, in the beginning of that Chapter of Saint Augustine, To eat, and now in the end thereof, Not to eat Christs Body? This [Hovv] is the very Birds eye, let therefore our ayme and levell be at this. Those foresayd Prophane livers tooke to themselves this presumption for their Pillow to leane and sleepe upon, in indulging themselves in their wickednesse. Wee (say they) do eat, no onely the Sacrament, but indeed wee eat Christs Body it selfe, because wee are members of his mysticall Body. S. Au∣gustine answereth directly, that Christ by saying [Hee that eateth my flesh abideth in mee,] sheweth what it is to Eat Christs Body [non Sacramento tenus] that is, Not onely as con∣cerning the Sacrament, but [Indeed,] So hee. Where wee have a flat opposition, betweene that which is called [Re∣vera] a Reall eating, against Eating onely Sacramentally. So that the Antithesis falling betweene these Termes, of Ea∣ting Christs Body [Revera, Indeed] by the Godly; and of Eating it onely [Sacramento tenus] as much as to say, Not indeed, by the Wicked: It must necessarily follow, that the Wicked do not eat, Indeed, the Body of Christ; and Con∣sequently, that there is [not Indeed] in this Sacrament, the Corporall Presence of Christ, which your Profession tea∣cheth to be Eaten as well of a Wicked man, or of vile Myce, as it can be of the most Faithfull member of Christ. Againe Saint Augustine once told us, That the Sacrament is called the Body of Christ, not in the Truth of the thing, but in a Signifi∣cant mystery, which your owne Romish Glosse expoundeth to meane, that It is called Christs Body Improperly. The Second Assertion of Saint Augustine will accord to our former Conclusion,Aug. Tract. 26. in Ioh. [Qui mandu∣cat carnem meam, in me manet.] Qui non manet in Christo, proculdubio non mā∣ducat Spritualiter carnem Christi, nec bibit ejus sanguinem,  carnaliter & visibiliter prem at dentsbus Sacramentum corporis—Tantae rei Sa∣cramentum ad judicium sibi manducat. Hee that abideth not in Christ (saith hee) although hee presse with his Teeth, the Sacrament of Christs flesh; yet doth hee not Eat the Spirituall flesh of Christ. The Observable is, that hee saith not, They eat not Spiritually the flesh of Christ; But [They eat not the Spirituall
flesh of Christ:] therefore called Spirituall, because it is Hypostatically united unto his Deity. So then, that which they properly Eat, is not Christ Body, but onely the Sacra∣ment thereof: allowing no Corporall Touch with the Teeth, but onely of the Sacrament it selfe. Compare wee now this Doctrine of Saint Augustine of Pressing onely the Sa∣crament of Christs Body, and not Christs Body it selfe; with your Pope Nicholas his Profession of Tearing of Christs Body with mens Teeth,See below Ch. 5. Sect. 1. (above mentioned) and then will it be easie for any man of but ordinary Capacity to collect, that Pope Nicholas, by his Affirmation, meant as directly to proclame your Romish Article of the Corporall Presence of Christs Body in the Sacrament; as S. Augustine, by his Denyall, meant utterly to disclame and abandon it. In the thire place, Saint Augustine, for your better instru∣ction, and apprehension of his meaning, exemplifyeth it by two notable Instances and Comparisons; the First, between two different kinds of Communicants, at our Lords owne Table, namely Christs faithfull Apostles, and the Reprobate Iudas, saying,Aug. Tract 59. in Ioh. Illi mandu∣carunt panem, Do∣minum; Iudas au∣tem panem Domini. They received the Bread, the Lord; (mea∣ning the Body of Christ) But Iudas, What? Hee received but the Bread of the Lord (which was but the Sacramentall Bread.) The onely Answer which yourResp. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Eucharist. cap. 13. Iudas inuti∣liter edebat, sicut qui comedit et rejicit ∣sus, dicitur non com∣edere. Cardinall vouch∣safeth is, that Saint Augustine spake so, because Iudas ate the Bode of Christ Vnprofitably: as if the Difference of Eating, and, Not Eating, Christs Body had beene betweene the Dif∣ferent effects, Eating Profitably, and Not Profitably, which you call Spiritually, and not Spiritually, which is the Evasion of others: when as indeed the Comparision is expresly be∣tweene the divers Subject matters of Eating; The one be∣ing Bread, the Lord, which is Christs Body; the other be∣ing the Bread of the Lord, which is the Sacramentall Bread; as any,  but an Halfe-eyed man, may easily discerne. Another Comparision remayneth, whereabout wee are to have  Conflict with your Doctor Heskins. A Vindication of a Speciall Testimony of Saint Augustine, in the same point, against the notorious Falsification of his words, by Doctor Heskins. SECT. X. DOctor Heskins, before that he deliver the Sentence it selfe, as a man but about to put on his Harnesse, and yet sounding a Triumph before the victory, prefaceth say∣ing; This place of Saint Augustine presseth our Adversaries so hard, that they have no refuge. So hee. The words of Saint
Austine (speaking of Moses and other Faithfull, in the Old Testament, who in eating Manna, ate Christ Spiritu∣ally, and therefore although they died in Body, yet died not Spiritually in their soules) are theseAug. To. 9. Tract. 26. in Ioh. Illi mandu∣caverunt Manna, & mor non sunt: Quare? quia visibi∣lem cibum spirituali∣ter intellexerunt, nam & hodiè visibi∣lem cibum accipimus; Sed aliud est Sacra∣mentum, Aliud virtus Sacramenti. Quàm multi de Altari acci∣piunt & moriuntur? unde dicit Apostolus judicium sibi man∣ducant. [Multi mandu∣caverunt Manna & mortui non sunt, Quare? quia visibilem cibum Spiritualiter acceperunt—nam & hodiè visibilem cibum accipimus; sed aliud est Sacramentum, Aliud virtus Sacra∣menti. Quàm multi de Altari accipiunt & moriuntur?] That is, Many of them (the Jewes) ate Manna and died not; (namely in Soule) But why? Because they understood it Spi∣ritually; For wee also, at this day, do receive the visible meat: But the Sacrament is one thing, and the Virtue of the Sacrament another thing. How many do receive from the Altar and do die, and eate damnation to themselves. So hee. Namely (say wee) Because they ate onely the Sacrament, as the visible meat, and not the Virute, that is the Bodie of Christ signified thereby: And by this our Paraphrasis Saint Augustine is fully Pro∣testant, professing with us, that the Wicked Communicants do not eate the Body of Christ. Your Doctor, to make Saint Augustine as flatly a Papist as himselfe, hath framedDr Heskins in his parliament of Christ. Booke 3. c. 48. fol. 368. & 369. The place of Saint Augustine presseth our Adversaries so strictly, that they have no refuge, Say∣ing, Manducaverunt multi qui Domino placuerunt, & mortui non sunt; Quare? quia visibilem cibum spiritualiter intellex∣erunt—Nam & hodie nos accipi∣mus visibilem cibum; [Scd aliud est Sacra∣mentum, aliud virtus Sacramenti, quam multi de Altari acci∣piunt & mòriuntur. Note here (saith he) the Distinction that Saint Augustine ma∣keth betwixt the Sa∣crament, and the vir∣tue of the Sacra∣ment, Saying: that the Sacrament is one thing, and the virtue of the Sacrament another. Then of the virtue of the Sacrament, he saith, that many doe receive it at the Altar and do die. Meaning according to the Saying of the Apostle, that receiving, it unwor∣thily  they Die in the Soule, eating and drinking their owne Damnation. Now would it be learned of the Adversary, how hee will understand Saint Augustine in this word [Virtue.] First certaine it is, that it is not taken for the Sacramentall Bread: For, that is the other member of the Distinction. Then must it either be taken for the virtue of the Passion of Christ, or for the Body of Christ it selfe. For in the Sa∣crament be no more but these three to be received, The Sacrament, The Body of Christ, and the virtue of his Passion. It cannot be taken for the virtue of Christ's Passion, for that is not, nor cannot be Death and Damnation to the Receiver in the receiving, but Life and Salvation. This virtue that Saint Augustine speaketh of is such, that many do die in the receiving of it. It remaineth then, that by this virtue of the Sacrament, is understood the Body of Christ, which many by unworthy receiving do wickedly abuse, and so receiving kill their soules, and Die the Death that Iudas did. See the Margin) a false Allega∣tion, by depraving the latter part of the Sentence of Saint Augustine, alleging them thus: Nam & multi hodie de Altari accipimus cibum visibilem: [Sed aliud est Sacramentum, aliud Virtus Sacramenti? quam multi accipiunt & moriuntur.] that is, Many now rèceive from the Altar the visible meate; [But the Sacrament is one thing, and the Virtue of the Sacrament ano∣ther thing, which, many eating die.] And thereupon taking a full Cariere in a large Discourse (See the margin) argueth thus. By the word [Virtue] (saith hee) is meant the Body of Christ: And by [Dying] is meant the death of the Soule; But Saint Augustine affirmeth that the Wicked do eate of this [Vir∣tue] or Body of Christ. So hee; Point-blanke Contrary to our Interpretation as can be, not but that wee confesse, that Saint Augustine by this word, Virtue, meant the Body of Christ; and that by Dying, is understood the Death of mens Soules; but that his Assertion affirming Saint Augustine to teach here∣in That the Wicked Receivers that Dye in their Soules, do eate
the Virtue which is the Body of Christ; is a plaine Imposture by a Grossely false Construction and Composition of Saint Augustines words thus: [Aliud est virtus Sacramenti. Qudm multi &c.] wherein you see a full point, as a deepe Ditch, to sever virtus from the immediatly following word, Quàm, which your Doctor joyneth together, whereby the word, Virtus, is Vitiously abused. Then is he injurious to Quàm, which being an Adverbe, and carrying the Adverbiall Ac∣cent above-head, as a Badge of Distinction, hee notwith∣standing turneth into a Pronoune-adjective, Quam; And thirdly, He wrongeth the Construction of them both, in matching, as it were in marriage, a littleu in Virtus, with a great Q in Quàm, whereas every Grammarian, by all the rules of Syntaxis, would forbid the Banes. Wee know you (Romish Priests) to be reasonable men, and will therefore demand; whether hee had not reason, by some other Edition of Saint Augustine, to justifie his Al∣legation, and thereby his owne Conclusion, as if Saint Au∣gustine had meant, That the wicked do Dye in their Soule, by unworthy Eating of the Reall Body of Christ? Wee answer, no: It is Impossible hee should evade by any such excuse, and lest wee may seeme to speake partially, wee shall offer un∣to you a witnesse hereof, without all exception, and that shall be the Author Saint Augustine himselfe, the Expositor of his owne meaning in the very same Tractate, and in his words a little after expresly concluding the Contrary, saying: that Aug. Tom. 9.  Ioh. Tract. 26. Hic est panis qui de coelo descendit, ut si quis manducaverit ex ip∣so, non moriatur. Sed quod pertinet ad vir∣tutem Sacramenti; non quod pertinet ad visibile Sacramen∣tum; Qui manducat intus, non foris, qui manducat in corde, non qui premat den∣te. [Hee that eateth of this, so farre as concerneth the virtue of the Sacrament, cannot Dye; albeit otherwise in respect of Ea∣ting onely the visible Sacrament, he do dye.] Where you see, that none that eate the Virtue, which is (as hath beene con∣fessed) the Body of the Lord, dye the Death of the Soule. And for better explanation, hee distinguisheth, affirming that the Maner of Eating of the virtue of this Sacrament, is, Eating it, [Intus corde, Inwardly in the heart:] and the Eating of the other Sacrament it selfe, is Eating outwardly, and with the Teeth. Now then, that your Doctors Error is found to be so pal∣pable, and our Cause so Justifiable, even by the Judgement of Saint Augustine, will you, (as you are reasonable) be also so Conscionable to permit us, upon so great advantage, to retort that Epiphonema, wherewith your Doctor concludeth against us, after his Discourse of this and other Testimonies of Saint Augustine, already Answered, viz. Thus have you received the minde of Saint Augustine, as the Catholike Church teacheth, and not as the malignant feigneth. {fleur-de-lys}

Maldonate confesseth to have beene Learned, Godly, and Catholike; yet fretteth not a little at them, for so resolutely affirming that In this Chapter of Saint Iohn, there was no speech of the Eucharist, because by this their opposition hee was hindred (as theMaldonat. in Ioh. 6. vers. 53.

Jesuite himselfe saith) That hee could not so sharpely and vehemently in∣veigh against Protestants. Let it then be supposed as spoken with a relation to a Sacramentall Eating with the mouth, as some of the Fathers thought; but yet onely Sacramentally, and not Properly, as by them will be found true. Wee returne to the Discourse of your Romish Priest,Above at (a) Christ having spoken (saith hee) of Eating his Flesh, and the Capernàites answering [How can hee give us his Flesh to eate?] They under∣stood eating with the mouth, yet were (a speciall observation) ne∣ver reproved of Christ for mistaking the meaning of his words, a strong reason that they understood them rightly; but for not be∣leeving them: and Christ often repeating the eating of his Flesh, and drinking of his Blood, and requiring them to beleeve, and when hee saith [The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that quickeneth] it is not spoken to exclude the Reall Presence, or to qualifie his former sayings, but to admonish them not to judge things by carnall reason, and yet more evidently in the words following [There are some of you that beleeve not] Hee sayd not (saith Saint Augustine) there be some among you that understand not: so plain∣ly did hee hereby instruct them not how to understand, but how to
beleeve; for had hee, for their better understanding, intended hereby to have qualified, or corrected his former sayings, as to be meant Eating Spiritually by Faith, hee would have explained him∣selfe in plaine termes, and so have satisfied the Iewes. Vpon which premises I do conclude, that because our Saviour did reprove his Scrupulous hearers not for want of understanding, but for want of beleefe, it doth from thence, and from other premises abun∣dantly follow that his fore-sayd promise was not obscure, and Figu∣rative, but plaine and literall for our receiving of him without our bodily mouthes. Thus farre your celebrious Priest, namely so, as in almost all other his Collections, not understanding the Truth of the mat∣ter. His Inferences stand thus. First, Christ reprehended the Capernaites, for not Beleeving his words concerning Eating his Flesh: but not for not understanding them. Therefore it fol∣loweth that they understood his words, of Eating his Flesh, right well. Secondly, They understood his Speech: There∣fore Christ, in saying, The Flesh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that quickeneth, did not thereby qualifie his former speech, to instruct their understanding: Thirdly, They needed no instru∣ction of their understanding; Therefore Christs words of Eating his Flesh, were not Figurative. Fourthly, these his words were not Figurative: Therefore his words of Eating his Flesh, teach a Corporall Presence thereof in the Sacrament. Each of these Consequences are delivered as ignorantly; as confidently. For common learning teacheth, that there is a double consideration of Truth, in every True speech; the one is that it is True; the second is what is the Truth, or true sense thereof? To the apprehending of the first is requi∣red Beliefe, whereupon Aristotle gave that Rule to every Schollar, that intendeth to learne the principles of any Art (to wit) Oportet discentem credere: A Schollar is bound to beleeve. The other point, touching the Truth, or true sense, what it is, is the Object of mans understanding; so that there is a great dif∣ference betweene both these in the case of a Reprehension. As for example; the Master teaching the definition of Logick, say∣ing; It is an Art of Disputing rightly, may justly reprove his Schollar for his not beleeving it, because his not beleeving is wilfull: so can hee not for his not understanding it, for that hee therefore learneth, because hee doth not understand; except it be, that being taught hee either through carelesse negli∣gence, or else affected ignorance will not understand. This agreeth with the Current of Scripture Iohn 6. verse 38. Christ being the Oracle of Truth, which descended from Hea∣ven to reveale the will of his Father, might justly exact Beliefe, that whatsoever hee spake to the sonnes of men was most true: as it is written, The will of God is, that whosoever beleeveth in
mee, &c. verse 40. viz. That they must Eate his Flesh. But his hearers could not understand What was the true sense of these words, which caused them to say, This is an hard saying. There∣fore (like Schollars of preposterous wits) would they not be∣leeve , namely That they were True: hence it was that Christ reproved them for not beleeving onely verse 64. and not for not understanding. Because it was as lawfull for Christs Dis∣ciples to be ignorant of his darke sayings and Parables (which were therefore so spoken, that his Schollars might more ear∣nestly labour to know them) as it was after lawfull for them to seeke of their Master, (whose precept is toMatth. 7. 7. Seeke, and pro∣mise to Find) how to understand them. As it is written;Matth. 13. 36. His Disciples sayd unto him, Declare unto us the Parable of the Seed: and Christ answered them, Hee that soweth, &c. That admirable Doctor of Gods Church Saint Augustine will shew himselfe herein an understanding Schollar of Christ (see his Testimony) requiring of all the Disciples of Christ, in the first place, Beliefe of Christs-words, that they are True, before they did understand what was the Truth thereof: con∣firming his Rule by that Scripture; Except you believe you shall not understand. O, but) the Capernaites (saith Master Brerely) did understand Christs words right well. And SaintAug. in Ioh. 7. Tract. 27. [Sunt qui∣dam in vobis, qui non credunt.] Non dixit, sunt quidam in vobis qui non intelligunt sed causam dixit quare non intelli∣gunt, nempè quia non credunt—ut Propheta, nisi credi∣deritis, non intellige∣tis. Aliquanto supe∣rius. Illi putarunt il∣lum erogatuum cor∣pus suum—Ille autem dixit, se ascensurum in coelum—Certe tunc intelligetis, quia eo modo, quo putatis, non erogat corpus—[Caro non prodest quicquam.] Sicut illi intellexerunt car∣nem, spiritualiter in∣tellectum vivificat. And Master Brerely out of Augustine in Psal. 98. [Nisi quis manducavetit.] Dix∣erunt, durus hic ser∣mo; accepunt illud stultè carnaliter illud cogitaverunt. Augu∣stine contrary to Master Brerely, expressely answereth, They did not understand the Truth of Christ his Speech, but apprehended it foolishly and literally; nor was there ever any Father, or Author, no not in your owne Romish Church (wee thinke) before one Master Brerely, that thought otherwise. Wee are willing your Bishop Iansenius may moderate this Difference. (See theIansenius Con∣cord. cap 59. upon the very words of Saint Augustine. [Non dixit, sunt quidam in vobis qui non in∣telligunt, sed causam dicit quare non intelligunt.] Advertenda differentia inter credentes & non credentes: non credentes ob verba non intellecta offendebantur, credentes verò verba non intellecta humiliter susceperunt, & admirabantur. Margin.) His second Assertion, touching that speech of Christ, [The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the spirit that quickneth,] That it was not spoken by Christ to Qualifie his former termes of Eating his flesh, is very like also to be his owne, being flatly contrary to the same Father, whom hee avouched; for Saint Augu∣stine saith that Christ, by these words, taught the Capernaites to understand his other words of Eating Spiritually; a Truth which Master Brerely's owne great Master, CardinallSed verus & literalis sensus eorum verborum est, carnalis intelligentia nihil prodest, ut exponunt Chrysost. Theophyl. Euthem. nec non Origines. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Euch. cap. 14. Bel∣larmine, hath published, alleging for proofe thereof the Te∣stimonies of other Fathers, saying; Chrysostome, Theophylact, Euthemius, and also Origen so expoundeth it. So hee. {fleur-de-lys} Who notwithstanding should not have balked Tertullian, where speaking of these Carnall Hearers, hee saith, thatTert. de Resurr. Quia durum & intoler abilem sermonem ejus exisimarunt, quasi verè carnem suam illis edendam determinasset, subjunxit: [Caro nihil prodest] sed ad vivisicandum exequitur quod velit intelligi, spiritum [verba quae locutus sum, sunt spiritus & vita.] They
thought that speech of Christ to be hard and intollerable, as if Christ had determined to deliver his flesh to be (Marke) truly Eaten: therefore Christ added, saying The flesh profiteth no∣thing,] But for giving of Life, is required the Spirit, [The words which I speake are Spirit, and Life.] What can be more plaine to prove that the Truly proper Eating must needs sig∣nify an Eating Carnall, and Capernaiticall. {fleur-de-lys} Master Brerely his third Inference is; Therefore the words, speaking of Eating his flesh, are not Figurative; which indeed is the maine Controversie, for never any but an Infidell de∣nyed the speech of Christ to be true; nor yet did ever any, but an Orthodoxe, understand the Truth of the speech, what it was, that's to say, whether the Truth be according to a Literall sense, (as Master Brerely would have it) or else in a Figurative; which hath beene our defence and proofe throughout the Second Booke, from all kind of Evidences of Truth.

So hee; albeit Christ his speech was as expresly for drinking his Blood, as for Eating his Body. And hee (wee suppose) will confesse, that every speech, which is Vnproper, is Figurative. As for Saint Augustine, hee standeth as a sworne witnesse against the proper and literall sense of Eating Christs Flesh, calling itSee after∣wards, Chap 6. § 3. in the Challenge. Fla∣gitious. Besides, rather than wee should want witnesses, to averre this Truth, Divers Jesuites will be ready (in theSee afterward c. 5. Sect. 2. following Chapter) to tell Master Brerely flatly, that if hee say the words, Eating Christs Flesh, are properly spoken, he speaketh False. II. Proving the Objected Saint Augustine to Contradict the Romish Doctrine of Corporall Presence, as Pro∣testantly as can be. SECT. II. MAster Brerely his Conclusion, taken from Christs speech of Eating, is to inferre a Corporall presence of Christ in the Sacrament. {fleur-de-lys} But Saint Augustine upon these words of Christ, Iohn 6.Aug Tract. 27  Ioh. [Si ergo videri∣tis filium hominis as∣cendentem ubi erat prius] quid est oc  sol vit quod illos moverat? hinc aperuit unde fuerant Scandalizati? Hinc planè,  inlligernt Illi enim puabant cum erogaturum corpus suum, Ille autem dixit se ascensurum in coelum, utiquè integ Cum  hominis ascendentem ubi erat pius, cerè vel tunc videbitis, qui non eo modo, quo puatatis,  corps suum: certò vel tunc intelligetis, quia gratia ejus non consumitur . [When you shall see the Sonne of man as∣cending into Heaven where hee was first] saith that Christ by those words, Assoyleth the doubt, which troubled and scanda∣lized
the Capernaites, who thought that Christ should give them his Flesh to eate; by saying, that he was to ascend into heaven, doubtlesse with his perfect Body; and that therefore they were not to thinke that his Body was to be given unto them, in the ma∣ner which they conceived, by eating it by Bits and Morsels. {fleur-de-lys} Wherein you may plainly discerne the Argument of Saint Au∣gustine to be, that Christ by his Bodily Ascension would shew to the world, that hee being Bodily absent from the Earth, his Flesh could not be here Eaten by Bodily Tearing asunder. Thus hee against the Capernaites, which must as necessarily Confute the Romanists Corporall Eating his Flesh, whether it be by Chewing, or Swallowing; whether Visibly, or Invisibly it mattereth not; because it being the same Body that ascended, were it Visibly, or Invisibly, it is equally absent from Earth. {fleur-de-lys} As for the Remainders of that which is eaten of in the Sacrament, theSee above Booke 3. c. 3. §. 11. Fathers (as wee have heard) have called them Fragments, and Bits. And that which Iudas received from the hand of Christ, Saint Augustine himselfe calleth Aug. Tract. 26. in Iob. 6. Nonne Buccella Dominica venenum fuit Iudae? & tamen accepit; sed non quia male, sed quia male malus. Buccella, a Morsell. If then by the judgement of Saint Augustine, Christ his Bodily Ascension into Heaven, proved that hee was not to be Eaten by Morsels here on Earth; then must it thereupon necessarily follow, that the Sacrament of the Eucharist, given to Iudas, which Saint Augustine calleth a Morsell, was not the Body and Flesh of Christ. {fleur-de-lys} Wee have no list, after so plaine a discovery of Master Brerely his manifold ignorances, to play upon his Person, but rather do pray that at the sight of his Errors hee may be reduced unto the Truth, now, after his (fondly miscalled) Strong Reasoning to the Contrary. CHAP. IV. That the now Romish maner of Vnion, and Bo∣dily receiving of the Body of Christ, is sufficiently Capernaiticall in Five kinds. SECT. I. TEll us not that no Doctrine of your Church can be called Hereticall, before that it be so judged by some Generall Councell: no, for Rectum est In∣dex sui & Obliqui, and therefore an evident Truth, written in the word of God, doth suffi∣ciently condemne the Contrary of Heresie, as well as Light doth discover and dispell Darkenesse. And this is manifest by
the example, which wee have now in hand, of the Capernaites, old Heretikes, (as all know) even because they are set downe in Scripture to have perverted the sense of Christ his words of Eating his Flesh; and thereupon to have departed from Christ, Iohn 6. Your Romish particular maner of Corporall Re∣ceiving of the Body of Christ in this Sacra∣ment, is Five-fould. to wit in the 1. Hand, by Touch, for Eating. 2. Mouth, by Eating. 3. Throat, by Swallowing. 4. Belly, by Commixture. 5. By Vnion in the Inferiour parts, unworthy to be named. {fleur-de-lys} That the First maner of Romish Corporall Vnion of Christs Bodie with the Bodies of the Communicants, by Bodily Touch, is Capernaiticall, and the Testimonies of the Fathers are unconscionably urged to the Contrary. SECT. II. VNion of Christ his Body, by a Bodily Touch, in gene∣rall, is the Adequate and Proper Subject of this whole Question, concerning Christ his Conjunction with the Bodies of the Receivers, in this our present Discourse; whether it be Touch by Hand, or Mouth, or Throat, &c. and there∣fore wee begin with the First degree of Touch, as it were by Hand; which, in the generalitie thereof, may imply all the other Touches. Your Objected Testimonies are, either our of Cyrill, talking of bringing our Earthly Bodies, by parti∣cipation of this Sacrament to aCyril. Alex. lib. 4. in Ioh. cap. 14. Vnde ut hoc corpus  cibo sibi cognato gustu, tactu, ad immortalitatem reducetur? Objected by Bell. lib. 2. de Eu∣char. c. 25.

Many (saith hee) desire to see the forme of Christ, and here Christ yeeldeth himselfe (in this Sacrament) not onely to be seene, but also to be felt and Touched. And this will your Doctors needs inforce upon us, for proofe of a Cor∣porall Touch, and Consequently a Corporall presence of Christs Body in the Eucharist. But do you not see, in this Testimony, the word [See,] as well as the word [Touch?] and are you now to learne that which you all teach, that Christs Body, as it is in this Sa∣crament, is altogether Invisible beyond mans Imagination, and not to be seene of men; no, nor yet to be discernd by the very Devills. Besides, that All mens eyes, by Contemplation, can avouch it to be nothing lesse than Seene. So that the word [Seene] being so Vnproperly and Figuratively spoken, might have given you reason to discerne, that hee used the same
Impropriety of Phrase in the other word [Touch.] Yea, and Chrysostome himselfe will tell you, that hath Rhetoricated as fully in the word Touch; when in an Homily hee willed the PeopleChrysost. in Mart. 14 (To people that were to be bapti∣zed.)

Therefore can it be no lesse than a blind Boldnesse, to urge the word [Touch,] as Properly spoken by these Ancient Fathers, which you have learned, by your Fathers, of the Romish Profession, cannot properly agree with the Body of Christ. What evasion have you now? ForsoothIdem Ibid. quaest. 75. Art. 2. Disp. 180. cap. 9. Tangi dicitur sub pa nis speciebus remote, sicut Christus Luc. 8.

The Cause (saith the same Vasquez) is, as it was with Christ when he sayd Who Toucheth me] when men touched him, but not immedi∣atly, but by Touching his garment. So he. But soft Sir, you your selfe have already affirmed, That Christ cannot possibly either Touch or be Touched of any thing in this Sacrament, accor∣ding to the Doctrine of Aquinas, who giveth this reason, forSee the Testimonie of Aquinas, here above cited, at (4). That the sense of Touch hath no habitude at all to Christs Body herein, not so much as by the Accidents, or formes of Bread and Wine, neither mediatly nor immediatly; which sheweth the Dissimilitude of the Comparison taken from Touching Christs Vestment, (and thereby his sacred Body, which was touched by the same Vestment immediatly) and here Touching Christs Body by the Accidents of Bread, which you grant, do neither Touch Christs Body, nor are Touched by it; because Christs Body is therein Simply as a Substance without Accidents. From the Manuall Touch, by Handling, wee proceed to the Orall, by Eating. {fleur-de-lys}
CHAP. V. Of the Second Romish Bodily maner of Vnion with Christs Body by Eating. That the Second Romish Bodily maner of Vnion with the Body of Christ, which is by Orall Eating, once professed in the Church of Rome, was both Capernaitically-Hereticall, and is also still no lesse, in the Profession of di∣vers in the same Church. SECT. I. THe first member wil appeare by the Faith of the Church of Rome, in the Dayes of Pope Nicholas, whose Faith (about the yeare 1509.) may be best known by the Oath, which was prescribed by him unto Berengarius, concerning the Eating of the Body of Christ in this Sacrament. Which Oath (as yourBaron. An. 1059. num. 11.

Cardinall Baronius doth certifie you from the Sto∣ries of those times) Pope Nicholas and a Generall Councel held at Rome revised, approved, and prescribed to Berengarius to take, for the abjuration of his Errour, concerning the maner of Eating the Body of Christ; and the same Oath was after published by the Popes authority throughout all the Cities of Italy, France, and Germany; and wheresoever the Report of Berengarius should come. So hee. You cannot now but expect such a forme of an Oath, which must be as truly Romish, as either Romane Pope, or Romane Councel could devise. Marke then the enjoyned tenour of the Oath. I Berengarius Archdeacon, &c. do firmely professe, that I hold that Faith, which the Reverend P. Nicholas and this holy Synod hath com∣manded mee to hold, (to wit) That the Body of Christ is in this Sacrament, not onely as a Sacrament, but even in truth is sensibly handled with the hands of the Priest, and broken and torne with the Teeth of the faithfull. So the Oath. The same forme of Ab∣juration is registred in the publike PapallAd perpetuam rei memoriam, &c. Bulla P. ante Gratian. Extat in Decret. de Consecrat. Dist. 2. C. Ego Berengarius. Decrees: and the Body of these Decrees hath beene lately ratifyed by the Bull of Pope Gregory the thirteenth.

Primum, Bellarmine, for proofe of Transub∣stantiation, hath recourse unto the same Romane Councel, which hee styleth Generall, and noteth the thing defined to have beene the Iudgement of the Church; and that the same Iudgement was Delivered under the Censure of an Anathema and Curs against the Gain-sayers: and therefore Hee, with his Disciple MasterIn his Rejoynd. pag. 270. Fisher (who also allegeth the same) are Challengea∣ble to hold it according to the literall sense thereof; because it will not admit any qualification, by any Trope or Figure that can be devised. First, because the words are purposely set downe, as a Forme of Recantation and Abjuration of Heresie: but (asNullae sunt exactiores formulae loquendi, in materia fidei, quam eae quibus utuntur ij, qui Haeresin abiurant. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. Sanct. cap. 21. §. Secundo nulla. you confesse) There are no formes of speech more ex∣act and proper in phrase, concerning the matter of faith, than such as are used by them that abjure Heresie. And Secondly, for that this Forme of words, of Tearing with the teeth the flesh of Christ, was also made purposely for Abjuration, and abandoning all Figurative sense, for the Defence of the literall Exposition of the words of Christ [This is my Body, &c.] therefore was it taken literally: But what (thinke you) will Calvin say to this your (then) Romish forme of Profession, in the literall sense? Calvin. lib. 2.Defens. Sacram. Nonne centum potius mortes prae optandae sunt, quam ut quis tanti Sacrificij monstro se im∣plicet? pag. 25. A man should rather wish to die on hundred times (saith hee) than once to intangle himselfe in a Doctrine, so monstrously sacri∣legious. Which Censure of his wee now endeavour to make good.
That the foresayd Romane Faith, of Properly Eating the Body of Christ, is Capernaitically-Hereticall; as is proved by some of your owne Doctors of the now Romish Church. SECT. II. YOu have heard of Berengarius his Abrenuntiation of Heresie, according to the faith of the (then) Romane Church, in Breaking the Body of Christ, and tearing it sensibly with their teeth. Hearken now a little, and you shall heare, in a maner, an Abrenuntiation of that (then) Romane faith, by denying it to be either properly Broken or yet really Torne, even by the Jesuites themselves.Caro Christi, dum in hoc Sacra∣mento manducatur, non dentibus atteri∣tur, quia tangi ne∣quit, est{que} immorta∣lis & impartibilis.

Tract. 20. pag. 136▪ Reall Eating (saith your Salmeron) requireth a reall touch and tearing of the thing which is eaten: but the Body of Christ is not torne with teeth, or touched by them that eat him, because hee is herein impartible. So hee. Your Jesuite and Cardinall Bellarmine is as it were in a maze, say∣ing and gain-saying, as you may perceive: yet notwithstan∣ding, whether hee will or no, must perforce confesse no lesse, when hee saith thatSi de ratione manductionis esset attritio dentibus fa∣cta, Dico, Christi corpus vere & proprie manducati, etiam corpore in Euchari∣stia, non quod attri∣tio est necessaria ad manducationem, sa∣tis est enim transmis∣sio in stomachum deglutendo Sin verò attritio dentibus fa∣cta sit de ratione manducationis: Dico Christi Corpus pro∣prie manducari, non tropice: non enim dicimus corpus Chri∣sti, absolute mandu∣cari, sed manducator sub specie panis: quae sententia significat species manducari vi∣sibiliter & sensibili∣ter, ac promde der∣tibus atteri. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Euch. ca. 11. §. Respon. Corpus. The Body of Christ is not absolutely ea∣ten, but eaten under the formes of Bread: and that is to say (saith hee) the formes of Bread are sensibly and visibly eaten. So hee. If this imported a literall maner of Eating, then might your Cardinall have sayd as literally of himselfe; My Clothes are torne, therefore my Body is rent in pieces. Not to trouble you with the Cardinall's Philosophy, that talketh of Eating and Tearing of Colours. But to the point. If onely the Accidents of Bread be (as hee saith) sensibly ea∣ten, then was Pope Nicholas his Prescription of Eating Christs Body sensibly, in your Cardinalls opinion, not True. And upon the same Ground it is, that your IesuitFrangi, me∣taphorica, & non propria locutio est, colligitur ex Thoma, qu. 77.

Art. 1. §. 4. Suarez, out of Thomas, and other Schoolemen, affirmeth the word [Broken] to be a Metaphoricall phrase, not properly belonging to the Body of Christ; because it requireth that there should be a Separation of the parts of that which is properly broken. So hee, as also yourCanus, see in the former Section. Canus hath concluded. And yourSi propriè loqui velimus falsae sunt hae propositiones, Corpus Christi manducatur a nobis, Corpus Christi devoratur, Corpus Christi frangi∣tur, quia ipsi modi, qui his verbis significantur, non conveniunt Copori Christi, quod est in hoc Sacramento: sed hae sunt verae, Recipitur à nobis, sumitur à nobis. Maldon. Ies. Tom. 1. de Sacram. Tract. de Euch. pag. 144. Verè sumitur, sed non atteritur. Ibid. pag. 143. Iesuite Maldonate is so bold as to tell you, that these Propositions, The Body of Christ is Eaten, is Broken, Torne with the Teeth, or Devoured of us (properly taken) are false. Thus your Iesuites, as if they had expressely sayd, that to thinke the Body of Christ to
be eaten, torne, or devoured (properly taken) is a Carnall, Caper∣naiticall, and (as your owneNisi sanè in∣telligas verba Beren∣garij, in majorem Haeresin incides quā Ipse fuerit.

The case then is plaine enough, for Confutation of your more ancient Ro∣mish Faith. That the former Romish and Popish Faith, for the Maner of re∣ceiving of the Body of Christ, is at this day but some∣what altered; yet miserably inconstant and Faithlesse. SECT. III. PRotestants may have in this place just matter of insultation against your Romish Professors, to prove their Infidelity in that which they seeme to professe. As first, that the Ground of your Doctrine of Corporall presence is the litterall and proper interpretation of the words of Christ, when hee sayd [Take, eate, this is my Body:] yet now are you compelled to say, that Properly eaten, is no proper, but a false sense. Your Second Doctrine is, that the Judgement of a Romane Pope, in a Romane Councell, in a matter of Faith, is Infallible. Notwithstanding Pope Nicholas, with his Romane Councel, is found to have grossely erred in a tenor of Abjuration, which of all others (as hath beene confessed) is most Literall, and was therefore purposely devised against a Figurative Sense of the words of Christ; and forth-with published throughout Italy, France, Germany, &c. to direct men in the Faith of sensuall Ea∣ting, breaking, and tearing the Flesh of Christ with their teeth: yet notwithstanding, your common Judgement being now to reject such phrases, taken in their proper Signification, and in a maner to abrenounce Berengarius his Abrenunciation, what is, if this be not an Argument that either you say, you care not, or else you beleeve you know not what? Let us goe on, in pur∣suit of your Doctrine of the Corporall maner of Eating, which you still maintaine, and it will be found to be Capernaiticall enough. And lest that you may evade, by pretence of Not-Chewing, wee adde as followeth.
That the Orall Eating of the Sacrament, was an∣ciently by Chewing. SECT. IV. CHewing the Sacrament with the Teeth was the forme of Eating, at the time of Christ his Institution, as is proved by your owneSuarez. See above, Booke 1. Cap. 1. Sect. 4. Confession, in granting that the unleavened Bread, which Christ used, was [Glutinosus,] that is, gluish, clam∣mie, and such as was to be cut with a knife. But that the same maner of Eating, by Chewing, was altered in the Apostolicall or Primitive times, is not read of by any Canon; yea or yet Admonition of any one Father in the Church, whether Greek, or Latine: among whom, Saint Augustine called the maner of eating, aSee above, cap. 2. Sect. 9. Pressing the Sacrament with the Teeth. That also Chewing continued in the Romish Church till a Thousand and fifty yeares after Christ, is not obscurely implyed in the for∣mer tenor of the Recantation of Berengarius, prescribed by the same Church; which was to eat (as you have heard) By tearing it with teeth. And lastly, that this hath since continued the or∣dinary Custome of the same Church, is as evident by your Car∣dinall Alan, and Canus,See above in the former Section. who have defended the maner of Ea∣ting, by Tearing. Nor was Swallowing prescribed by any untill that the queazie stomaches of yourHostiam sa∣livâ reverenter lique∣factam in corpus di∣mittat: non est enim dentibus terenda, vel palato admovenda, sed ante ablutionis sumptionem degluti∣enda. Coster. Ies. In∣stitut. lib 1 cap. 5. Jesuites, not enduring Chewing, perswaded the Contrary. Which kinds of Eating, whether by Chewing; or Swallowing of Christs Flesh, being both Orall, none can deny to have beene the opinion of theNimis carnaliter intelligebant (Discipuli Capernaitae) credentes ejus carnem comedi oportere, sicut ede∣bantur animalium carnes, quae dentibus conteruntur. Madridius. Ies. de frequenti usu Eucharistiae, cap. 4. Ca∣pernaites. First of Chewing; and then afterwards of Swallow∣ing in the sixt Chapter following, in it's due place. That the Corporall and Orall Eating of Christs Flesh is a Capernaiticall Heresie, is proved by the Doctrine of Ancient Fathers. SECT. V. SOmetime do Ancient Fathers point out the Error of the Ca∣pernaites, set downe Iohn 6. concerning their false inter∣preting the words of Christ, when hee speaketh of Eating his Flesh, which they understood literally. But this literall sense Origen. Hom. 7. in Levit. pag. 141. [Nisi manducaveritis carnem meam] Si se∣cundum literam se∣quaris hoc: ipsum quod dictum est, oc∣cidit haec litera: vis tibi aliam proferam ex Evangelio literam quae occidit, [Qui non habet, inquit, gladium, vendat tunicam, & emat gladium] Si vero spiritualiter, non occidit, sed est in eo spiritus vivificans. Origen calleth a Killing letter, that is, a pernicious interpre∣tation,
even as of that other Scripture [Hee that hath not a Sword, let him buy one: &c.] but this latter is altogether Figu∣rative, as you know, and hath a Spirituall understanding, there∣fore the former is Figurative also. AthanasiusAthanas. Tract. in illa verba. [Quicun∣que dixerit verbum in filium hominis, &c] Quod hominibus corpus suffecisset ad cibum, ut universis mundi alimonia fie∣ret.

That Christ might thereby draw their thoughts from the bodily sense, namely, of Eating it Corporally upon Earth, which is your Romish sense. {fleur-de-lys} His Reason, Reduced into Logicall forme, must have beene this, against the Capernaites (who imagined a Carnall Eating of Christs Flesh.) That which was to ascend into Heaven, could not be eaten Corporally on Earth: But Christ sayd that his Bo∣dy should ascend into Heaven. And therefore signified thereby that hee could not be eaten upon Earth; which ought to have beene a Satisfactory reason and Answere to the Capernaites themselves. {fleur-de-lys} Tertullian likewise giveth the reason of Christs saying, [It is the Spirit which quickeneth] because the Capernaites so under∣stood the words of Christs speech of Eating his Flesh, As if (saithTertul. de Ca∣pernaitis. Quia du∣rum & intolerabile existimarunt sermo∣nem, quasi vere car∣nem suam illis eden∣dam determinasset, praemisit, [Spiritus est qui vivificat] lib. de Resurrect. carnis. Tertullian) Christ had truly determined to give his Flesh to be eaten. Therefore it was their Errour to dreame of a truly Corporall Eating.Aug. in Iob 6. [Non moritur] Non qui panem premit dente, sed qui man ducat in Corde. Tract. 26.—Idem in Psal. 98. Spirituali∣ter intelligite, non Hoc corpus, quod vi∣detis, manducaturi estit, & bibituri san∣guinem illum, quem fusuri sunt, qui me crucifigent: Sacra∣mentum commen∣davi vobis, spiritua∣liter intellectum vi∣vificabit vos. Augustine, out of the sixt of Iohn, bring∣eth in Christ expounding his owne meaning of Eating his Flesh, and saying, You are not to eate this flesh which you see, I have com∣mended unto you a Sacrament, which being Spiritually understood shall revive you. Plainely denying it to be Christs Body which is Eaten Orally; and then affirming it to be the Sacrament of his Body: and as plainely calling the maner of Corporall Eating, A pressing of Bread with the teeth. Wee say Bread, not the Body of Christ. For, when hee cometh to our Eating of Christs flesh, hee exempteth the Corporall Instruments, and requireth only the Spirituall, saying,Aug. apud Gratian. de Conse∣crat.  2. Vt quid. Quid pa dentem & ventrem? crede & manducasti. Ex Aug. de remed.  §. ut quid. Why preparest thou thy Tooth? It is then no Corporall Eating: and hee addeth; Believe, and thou hast eaten. Saint Augustine goeth on, and knowing that Cor∣porall Eating of any thing doth inferre a Chewing, by dividing the thing eaten into parts (as your owne Iesuit hathSee above, Booke 5. cap. . §. 2. confessed) lest wee should understand this properly, hee teacheth us to sayIdem rursus apud Gra∣tiam ibid. Christus manducatus vivit; quia resurret it occius: nec, quando manduus, partes de illo faci∣mus, & qudem Sacramento id it: nout fideles quemadmodum manducent carnem Christi, per parte man∣ducatur in Sacramentis mnet integer clo & in corde. Ex Aug. Serm. de verbis Evangeli. Christ is not divided into parts. Contrarily, when wee speake Sacramentally, that is, Figuratively, and improper∣ly, hee will have us to grant that Christ his Body is divided in this Sacrament, but remayneth whole in Heaven.
Say now; will you say that Christs Body is Divided by your Eating the Eucharist, in a literall sense? your owne Iesuits have abhorred to thinke so. And dare you not say that in Eating this Sacrament you do Divide Christs Body, in a literall sense? then are you to abhorre your Romish Literall Exposition of Christs speech, which cannot but necessarily inferr a proper Dividing of the flesh of Christ. {fleur-de-lys} Wee may not conceale the Evasion, which your Dispu∣ters have devised, for blunting the Dit of this notable Sen∣tence. You see not the same Body (saith Saint Augustin)Bellarm. lib. 2, de Eucharist cap. 24. uxtà Lanfrancum. Resp. non Idem cor∣pus, id est, non èo∣dem modo, non in specie visibili aut mortali; Idem quo∣ad substantiam, non Idem quoad modum. That is (say they) not after the same maner (namely) not in a visible and mortall shape. So they. Than which Exposition what can be more extravagant, by skipping from the Predicament of Substance, to the Predicament of Quality? You shall not eat the same Body (saith Saint Augustine) What then shall they eat? Hee addeth, I have commended to you a Sacrament to be eaten. Therefore the Opposition used by Saint Augu∣stine, is to Distinguish betweene Christs Body, and the Sa∣crament of Bread; as betweene Substance, and Substance; for hee sayd not to eat his Body As you see it, to signify the maner of Eating invisibly: but you are not to eat That which you see; as denying Christs Body to be the matter of their Sight; even as Saint Augustine doth often expresse him∣selfe, as well in that place where hee called his Body, The Bread, the Lord: and the Sacrament, The Bread of the Lord: like as your owneGabriel Bil, Lect. 80. lit. n. Non, cum manducamus, partes de illo faci∣mus, & quidem in Sacramento id fit: intelligit nos non partē corporis Chri∣sti sumere, sed Sacra∣menti. Schoolemen discerned his meaning in the other words, of Eating▪ as yet not making parts of his Body, but of the Sacrament of his Body. {fleur-de-lys} Lastly, do but call to mind SaintSee above Chap. §. 2.  Augustines Observation (just the same with the now-Cited Testimony of Athanasius) to wit, Christs mention of his Ascension in his Body from Earth, lest that they might conceive of a Carnall Eating of his flesh; and these Premises will fully manifest, that Saint Augustines Faith was farre differing from the now Romish, as Heaven is distant from Earth. Wee still stand unto Christs Qualifica∣tion of his owne speech, when hee condemned all Carnall sense of Eating his flesh, saying thereof, The flesh profiteth no∣thing, &c. For Conclusion of this Point, you may take unto you the Commentary of SaintChrysost. in Io∣han. 6. (Gracè) Ho∣mi. 47. (Latinè) Ho∣mil. 46. [Verba, quae ego locutus sum, Spi∣ritus & Vita.] Suri∣tus, hoc est, Spiritus alia, hoc enim nihil carnale, nullam consequentiam carnalem habentia: [— to non prodest quicquam.] Quid hoc? nunc de ipsa carne dixit? absit, sed pro carnaliter audite de ijs, qui carnaliter accipiunt quae dicuntur—Quomodo non prodest quicquam caro, sine qua nemo potest ri∣vere? vide quod non de carne, sed de carnali auditione dictum est. Chrysostome, as followeth; Did not Christ therefore speake of his flesh? farre be it from us (saith hee) so to thinke! for how shall that flesh not profit, without which none can have life? but in saying [The flesh profiteth nothing] is meant
the carnall understanding of the words of Christ. And that you may know how absolutely hee abandoneth all carnall under∣standing of Christs words, of Eating his flesh, hee sayth, They have no fleshly, or naturall Consequence at all. So hee. Ergo, say wee (to the Confutation of your Romish Beliefe) no Corporall touch of Christ in your mouths, no Corporall Eating with your teeth, no Corporall Swallowing downe your throat; how much less any Corporall mixture in your Bellies or Guts, as your Romane See Chapt. 6. Sect. . following. Church professeth. CHALLENGE. WHether therefore the Capernaites though to eate Christs Flesh raw, or roasted; torne, or whole; dead, or alive; seeing that every Corporall Eating thereof, properly taken, is by the Fathers held as Carnall and Capernaiticall, it cannot be that the Romish maner of Eating should accord, in the Judgement of Antiquity, with the Doctrine of Christ. Notwithstan∣ding you cite us to appeare before the Tribunall of Antiquity, by objecting Counter-Testimonies of Ancient Fathers; and wee are as willing to give you Answering. The Extreme Vnconscionablenesse of Romish Disputers, in wrest∣ing the Figurative Phrases of Ancient Fathers to their Orall maner of Receiving the Bodie of Christ, proved by just eviden∣ces out of the Fathers themselves. SECT. VI. IT is a miserable thing to see how your Authors delude their Readers, by obtruding upon them the Sentences of Fa∣thers in a literall sense, against the evident Expressions of the same Fathers to the Contrary. I.Origen. Hom. 5.  divers. Script. Lo∣ca. Sub tectum tuam ingreditur, imitare Centurionem, & dic non sum dignus, Do∣mine, &c. Objic. Bell. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 8.

Orig. ibid.] Intrat nunc Dominus sub tectum credentium duplici figurâ seu more; quā∣ enim sancti Ec∣clesiarum Aistites sub tectum tuum , tunc ibidem Dominus per cos ingreditur, & tu sic existimes, tanquam Dominum suscipiendum. [The followeth the other figure.] Cum hic sanctus cibus, & incorruptibile epulum, &c. Origen (say you) will have the Communicant to thinke himselfe unworthy, that the Lord should enter under the roofe of his mouth. Right, hee saith so, but in the same sense wherein hee equivalently sayd, that Hee who entertaineth a Bishop and Spirituall Pastor, must know that now Christ entreth under his roofe, namely, Christ, Figura∣tively. II. Chrysostome (who speaketh in the highest straine) saith thatChrysost. Hom. 60. ad Pop. Antioch. Muli dicunt se velle videro ejus formam, ipse concedit, non tantum videre, sed & tangere, & monducare, & dentibus terere. So Chryst. ibid. Lingua rubescit sanguine Christi. Et lib. 3. de Sacerdio, & om. 47. in Ioh. [.] Spiritualia sunt. Wee see, touch, eate, and teare with our teeth the
Flesh of Christ. True, but, to note that hee spae it in a Rhetoricall & Figurative sense, he equivalently saith also in the same place; Our tongues are made red with his Blood. And elsewhere, to put all out of question;See his testi∣monie in the former Section at (i) These (saith he) are Spirituall, and containe no Carnall thing. Yet what need you our Comment? Your Josuit Maldonate would haue gladly prevented us,Dentibus te∣ri, quemadmodum Chrysost. locuus est, haec non postunt nis Sacramento tenus in∣telligt, non propri. Maldon. Ies. in Matt. 26. 26. The words of Chrysostome (saith hee) of tearing the Flesh of Christ, cannot be o∣therwise understood, than Sacramentally. Euen he, which concluded but now, that to saySee above, Ch. 4. Sect. 2. We eat Christs Flesh, properly, is a false pro∣position. {fleur-de-lys} And touching the other Phrase, S. Augustine as Em∣phatically of Baptisme,Aug. in Ioh. Tract. 11. Vnde rubet Baptismus, nisi Chri∣sti sangue conse∣cratus? It is red with the Blood of Christ. {fleur-de-lys} III. Gaudentius (say you) saithGaudent Pro∣misit corpus suum; porigit tibi corpus suum, corpu accipis, De pane fecit corpus proprium, &c. Obj. Bellar lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 21. [Albeit a lit∣tle after upon these words.

Gandent. Tract. 2. de Ratione Sacramento∣rum. We receive the Body which Christ reacheth, making of Bread his Body. We grant he sayd so, but hee interpreteth himselfe, saying; Christ would have our soules sanctified with the Image of his Passion. Againe, scan but his former words, Christ made his Body [de Pane, of Bread] in the literall Sense, and it will infer a Body of Christ not made of the flesh of the Virgin. IV. ButAug lib.  Con. adver.

Nay, but you have corrupted his Saying, for his word is [Gestamus] We beare or carrie it, (namely) by being Baptized (as there is expressed) whereof the Apostle sayd; You have put on Christ. VI.

[But Gregorie a little after of Baptisme,] Et in superlim nare domus agni sanguinem poimus, quia crucem illius passionis in fronte portamus. The Blood of Christ is sprinkled upon both Posts, when we receive it both with heart and mouth. Which (we say) he spake with the same Impropriety of speech, wherein he addeth equivalently, that The Blood of Christ is sprinkled upon the upper postes, when wee carry in our fore-heads (by Baptisme) the Signe of the Crosse. VII. ButIsych. l. 6. in Levit. c. 2 Per ignorantiam percipit, qui nescit quia corpus hoc & sanguis est secundùm veritatem, &c. Ob. Bellar quo supra [Yet the same Isych. lib. . in Levit. cap. .

None receiveth (saith Hesychius) save hee that perceiveth the truth of his Blood. But how? even as hee himselfe there addeth, By receiving the memory of his Passion.
{fleur-de-lys} In all the former Sentences of Saint Augustine, Pope Leo, and Pope Gregorie, all that wee reade of is, that the Body of Christ is Received in the Sacrament, not onely with the heart, or by Faith; but also with the mouth. And so will any Protestant affirme, not only in the same words of the Fathers, but also in their owne genuine Sense: if Saint Augustine, who is ob∣jected in the first place, may interpet his other Contests, who (in a Section before) sayes, as you have heard, that Bread is called Christs Body, not in the Truth of the things, namely, of propriety of speech, according to the letter, but in a Significant mysterie, or Mysticall Signification. To sig∣nifie unto us that Christs Body is in our heart Really, and in our mouths Sacramentally. {fleur-de-lys} VIII. But Optatus tels usOptat. Mile∣vit. lib. 6. contr. Par∣men.

Wee grant these to be the Phrases of Optatus, indeed, which you have objected: but, alas! my Ma∣sters, will you never learne the Dialect of Ancient Fathers, af∣ter so many examples, as it were lights, to illuminate your judgements? Wherein (as other Fathers have done) Optatus will instruct you in his owne language, who presently after in∣veighing against the same Donatists, saith; Christ is now beaten by you on the Altar. So hee; by the Hyperbole making Christ to be beaten, wherewith hee sayd Christ was seated on the Altar.

Wee cleave to his Crosse, sucke his Blood, and fixe our tongues within the wounds of our Redeemer, which are all Sacramentall, Allegoricall, and Tropologicall Phra∣ses; as Cyprian will clearely expresse himselfe, in respect of our outward man, and spiritually of the inward. Wee shall de∣sire Cyprian to be Moderator betweene us in this question, be∣fore wee come to an end of this Booke. CHALLENGE. BY this time it may appeare that all your so serious and ex∣quisite Collections out of the Fathers, for proofe of a Corporall presence of Christ in this Sacrament, and Vnion with the Partakers thereof, are found by this Encounter of just Pa∣rallels, to be indeed the idle imagination of your Teachers, and the erroneous Intoxications of all their Disciples, who yeeld assent unto them. For to interpret the Figurative spee∣ches of the Fathers literally, is all one, as to sticke Goose-fea∣thers in their Caps, and plainely to befoole them; by making them of all others the most egregiously absurd (as you have al∣ready heard,) and no lesse fond in the outward letter, than are these others that follow; (to wit) of Gaudentius;Gaudent. Tract. 2. Jubemur Caput Divinitatis e∣jus cum pedibus In∣carnationis mandu∣care. Wee are commanded to eate the head of Christ's Deity, with the feete of his Incarnation. Or the saying of Saint Hierome;Hier. in Psal. 147. Ego corpus Iesu Evangelium puto—Et cum dicit [Qui bibit sanguinem me∣um] licet in mysterio possit intelligi, ta∣men verius sanguis ejus, sermo scriptura∣rum est. When Christ sayd, Hee that drinketh my Blood, although it may be understood in a Mystery, yet the truer blood (saith hee) is the word of Scrip∣ture. Or as before him, Origen;Origen. in Numb. 23. Hom. 16. Bibere dicimur san∣guinem Christi, non solum Sacramento∣rum ritu, sed cum Doctrinae ejus verba recipimus, in quibus vita consistit: sicut ipse dicit, Ioh. 6. Ver∣ba mea Spiritus sunt & vita. Wee drinke the Blood of Christ (saith hee) not onely by the rite of a Sacrament, but also in receiving his word, whereof it is sayd, My words are Spirit and Life. So they. And so just Cause have wee to complaine of the Vnconsci∣onablenesse of your Objectors, by their so often abusing the Testimonies of these holy Fathers; insomuch that you had need of the often Admonition of your owne Senensis:Saepe monui∣mus non esse Conci∣onatorum verba sem∣per in rigore accipi∣enda: multa enim Declamatores per Hyperbolen enunct & inculcant vel oc∣casione personaum inducti, vel affectuum impetu, vel orationis cursu rapti, Hoc interdum Chrysosto∣mo contigit Sixtu Senenfis. Biblioth. lib 6. Annot. 152. I have often given warning (saith hee) that the Sayings of Fathers be not urged in the rigidnesse of their words, because they use to speake many times HYPERBOLICALLY, and in excesse, being ei∣ther transported by the vehemency of their Affections, or carried with the Current of their Speech. So hee. {fleur-de-lys} Thus have wee satisfied the objected Testimonies of the Fathers, by the Fa∣thers owne Equivalent Phrases and Expressions; All which challenge your Objectours of Vnconscionablenesse, for alleging them contrary to their owne Sense. Our next Section of Vnconscionablenesse will pierce deeper, by pro∣ving that you have alleged the fore-sayd Testimonies of the Fathers against your owne more direct, and free Con∣fessions.
The Vnconscionablenesse of the Romish Disputers, in Object∣ing the former Testimonies of Ancient Fathers: from the Confessions of the Romish Doctors themselves. SECT. VII. THis Section is to be divided into two Classes of Authors: One is of the Sayings of the Fathers, which you have earnestly objected: And the other must be of the Confessi∣ons of your owne Doctors, as well Iesuites as others, by whom the literall sense of the same Sayings and Phrases of the Fathers, are as liberally and expresly rejected. The Termes of the Fathers, which have beene alleged in the two former Sections were of these kinds; to wit, Christs Body, received in this Sacrament, is Tasted, Divided, Broken, Torne with the Teeth; And his Blood Sprinkled, and Powred into our mouths, and Drunken. If any Protestant should say that these speeches of the Fathers, are all Improper & Figurative, and therfore prove not your Conclusion (which is, that they meant Really a Corporall presence of Christ in this Sacrament) you would say that he interpreted the sayings of the same Or∣thodox Fathers falsly & Heretically, according to your maner of phrasing and entyling Protestants, to make their Answer seeme Odious. Wherefore wee now crave leave of you that wee may beleeve your owne Doctors themselves, from their owne Confessions, (See the Margin:) wee meane such, who, without exception, are privileged in your Church.

V. Of [Eating.] The Body of Christ is not absolutely Eaten, because if absolutely Eaten, then should it be torne with the Teeth, and if so, then also divided into parts: It is therefore sayd to be torne, by a Figure, because the formes of Bread are torne with the Teeth. Of the VI, and VII. [Sprinkling, and Powring out of Blood.] Those are not to be attributed to Christs Blood in the Sacrament; be∣cause these betoken a Shedding thereof, which is a Separation of it from his Body, which was never but once on the Crosse; nor is it properly Drunken.

But, I beseech you, what then meaneth that, which your Ro∣mish Instructions, Decrees, and Missals (as wee haveIbid. §. 1. heard) do teach you to do with the Hoast, in case that any either through Infirmity, or by Surfet and Drunkennesse, shall cast up the same Hoast out of his stomach?

Say not, that because the Bodie of Christ suffereth no hurt, therefore he cannot be said by Corporall Swallowing to be Devoured: for his Body was not corrupted in the Gave, and yet was it truly Buried; and his Type thereof, even Ionas without Mastication was Swallow∣ed up into the Belly of the Whale, and yet had no hurt. Not∣withstanding, he was first caught and devoured, who was after∣ward cast up and vomited.
That the same Romish maner of Receiving it downe into the Belly, is proved to be Capernaiticall, by the Iudgement of Antiquity. SECT. III. TTheophylactTheoph. in Ioh. 6. p. 304. Caper∣naitae putabant, quod Christus cogeret eos , vo∣ratores carnis suae esse: nos hic spiritu∣aliter intelligimus, ne{que} carnium vora∣tores sumus. noted the Capernaites Opinion to have bin, that the Receivers of the Body of Christ are , De∣vourers of flesh, where as the words of Christ (saith he) are to be un∣derstood Spiritually, and so will it be knowne that wee Christians (what?) are not Devourers of Christ. So he. But, that Swal∣lowing (properly taken) is a Devouring, hath beene proved: and, if Devoured, then why not also (that which is the Basest of all Basenesse) passed downe, by Egestion, into the Seege? where∣of the Antient Fathers have thus Determined. Origen, that Origen in Matth. ca. 15 [Quod si quicquid in os in∣greditur, in ventrem abit, & in secessum eijcitur.] Et ille cibus sanctificatus verbo Dei, juxta id quod habet materiale, in ventrem abit, & in secessum ijcitur. Cae∣terum juxta precatio∣nem pro proportione fidei factus sit utilis, efficiens ut perspicax sit animus. Nec ma∣teria panis, sed super eo dictus sermo pro∣dest non indigne co∣medenti. Et hae qui∣dem de Symbolico corpore: multa porro & de verbo dici pos∣sunt, quod factum est caro, verus{que} cibus, quem qui comederit vivet in aeternum. The materiall part of this meate, Sanctified by prayer, passeth into the Draught: which (saith hee) I speake of the Symbolicall Bodie, &c. Here will be no place for yourBellar. Ista omnia recte intellig possunt de Euchari∣stia—at mate∣riale, quod in seces∣sum abit, sunt acci∣dentia, non respectu formae naturalis, sed sanctificationis & magnitudinis: nam magnitudo ad mate∣riam potius pertinet quam ad formam—Et per hoc quod Symbolicum corpus vocat, intelligit cor∣pus Christi, ut est hic Symbolum & signum suipsius, ut rat in cruce. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. . Cardinalls Crotchets, who confessing Origen to have spoken all this of the Eucharist, would have us by Materials to understand Accidents in respect (saith hee) of Sanctification, which they had, and of Magnitude, which belongeth rather to the matter of a thing, than to the forme: and by Symbolicall Body, to conceive, that this was meant of the Body of Christ it selfe, as it is present in this Sacrament, a Signe, or Symboll of it selfe, as it was on the Crosse. So he; as if he meant to Crosse Origens intention throughout every part of his Testimony. For first, That which he called Bread, hee calleth also meat Sanctified. Secondly, That Meat he termeth Materiall. Third∣ly, This Materiall, he saith, passeth into the Draught. Lastly, concluding his speech, concerning the Sacramentall Body, and saying; Hithe have I spoken of the Symbolicall Body; immedi∣atly he maketh his ransition to speake of the Incarnate Body of Christ, as it is the True Soules meate. But first, meerely Ac∣cidents were never called, by Ancient Fathers, Meats. Second∣ly, never Materials. Thirdly, never Magnitude in it selfe, without a Subject, was judged otherwise than Immateriall. Fourthly, never any Immateriall thing to have Gravity, or weight in pressing the guts, to make an egestion into the Draught. If every one of these be not, yet all may make up a foure-fold Cord, to draw any Conscionable man to grant, that Origen was of our Protestants Faith. {fleur-de-lys} And although Obstinacie it selfe should struggle with us, touching the former sentence of Origen, yet his words imme∣diatly following, should (we think) challenge a Consent: Be∣cause
cause, after he had spoken of Sanctified meate, meate Materiall, meate which goeth into the Belly, Meate whose matter doth not profit the Eater, Meate passing into the Draught, Meate named the Symbolicall Body; (which your Cardinall teacheth to betoken Christs owne naturall Body:) He immediatly after maketh a Transition from this Meate, to that which he calleth the True meate, and saith;Sequtur apud Orig. in Matth c. 15. Haec quidem de Sym∣bolico corpore, multa porro de ipso verbo dii possunt, quod factum est caro, ve usque cibus, quem qui comederit, om∣mino vivet in aeter∣num, quem nullus malus potest ; nam si malus ederet verbum carnem fa∣ctum, cum sit panis vivus, nequaquam scriptum  Quisquis ederi hunc panem vivt in aeer∣num. Further more many things might be spoken of the word, which was made Flesh, even the True Bread, which, whosoever shall eat, shall live for ever: which no wicked man can eate, else should hee live for ever. Direct∣ly opposing this Word made Flesh, to that which he had cal∣led the Symbolicall Body. Ergo say wee, Origen (your Car∣dinall must pardon us) taught the Symbolicall Body, and Christ True and proper Flesh to be two different Subjects. And againe, for better manifestation, hee distinguisheth in their effects; the one to be insufficient to give life, the other to be Salvificall in it selfe, even to Life everlasting. And Thirdly hee differenceth them in their Eaters, intimating, that The wicked may be partakers of the former Symbolicall Bo∣die; because, of this flesh, whereof the Scripture saith, [The Word was made flesh,] called the True meate, he testifieth and professeth, that No wicked man can eate this. If, in imitation of Origens discourse upon the Eucharist, one should say of the Baptisme of a man of yeeres and growth, thus; Water in Baptisme, is in it selfe a Liquor, although profitable to the Receiver, according to the pro∣portion of Faith, yet doth it clense onely the flesh, and is afterward cast out of the Font into the Channell: (adding immediatly) Thus much be spoken of the Symbolicall Water: and should furthermore say many things of the True Water, which is the virtue and grace of the Holy Ghost, which who∣sover shall partake, shall live for ever: but whereof, No wic∣ked man can be partaker: What man can be so seely, as not to apprehend a plaine distinction, made bet ene the Symbo∣licall Water, and the Truly Spirituall, which is the Grace of the Holy Ghost, as differing in respect of their Essences, Ef∣fects, and in the Persons capable thereof? {fleur-de-lys} As for your Cardinalls Pageant of Christs Body in this Sa∣crament, as being a Signe and Symboll of it selfe, as it was on the Crosse, itSee Booke. Chap. 2. Sect 6. hath once already, and will theBooke 6. c. 5. Sect. 7. second time come into play, where you will take small pleasure in this figment. Againe concerning the Body of Christ it selfe,Cyrl. Hiero∣sol. Catech Mystag  Panis hic , &c. Cyrill Christianly denyeth it to goe either into the Bellie, or into the Draught; andChrysost. de Euch. in Encaen. Non sicut reliqu cibi in secesum vadunt: absit ne sic cogites.

Non iste panis est, qui va∣dit in corpus, sed pa∣nis vitae , qui animae nostrae sub∣stantiam fulcit. Ibid. supersubsta . Am∣brose is so sarre from the proper Swallowing of Christ in this Sa∣crament,
that Distinguishing betweene Corporall Bread, and the Body of Christ, (which he calleh Super substantiall Bread, and Bread of everlasting life, for the establishing of mans Soule) hee denyeth flatly that this is that Bread which goeth into the Body. If any Mouse (which, you say, may run away with the Hoast) be wholly fed thereon for a moneths space, the Egesti∣on of that Creature will be as Absolute a Demonstration as the world can have, that the matter fed upon, after Consecra∣tion, is Bread. And why may you not as well grant a power of Egestion, as confesse (which you do) in that Creature a Di∣gestion thereof? Two false Interpretations fell upon the Catholike Profession, concerning the Doctrine of the Eucharist, in the dayes of S. Au∣gustine; both which that holy Father did utterly explode. The first was by the Manichees, who teaching, thatAugust . ib. 20. cap 1. Ex fabula vestâ de Sp.

[Edit Paiijs. Anno. 1555.] Christ was Hanged on every tree, and tyed unto all meates which they eate, would needes have their Religion to be somewhat agreeable to the Catholike Profession. An Imputation which Saint Au∣gustine did abhorre, namely, that it should be thought that there was the same reason (concerning Christs Body) of the opinion of Mysticall Bread, among the Orthodox, which the Man∣chees had of their Corporall Bread. As for example, that Christ should be fastned or tyed to mens guts, by eating, and let loose againe by their belching. Which Hereticall Doctrine how shall it not accord with your Romish, which hath affirmed a passage and Entrance of Christs Body into, and Cleaving unto mens See Chap. 7. Sect. 1. Guts by eating? and a Repasse againe by Vomiting, albeit the matter, so fast and so loose, be (in the judgement of Saint Augustine) Bread still, after Consecration? The Second Calumniation aginst the True Professours, was by others, who testifyed that Catholikes in the Eucharist adored Ceres and Bacchus, after the maner of the Pagans. What answer, do you thinke, would a Romish Professour have made in this Case? doubtlesse (according to your Doctrine of Cor∣porall Presence) by saying thus: Whereas some affirme that wee do adore Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, yet the truth is wee adore that, whereunto Bread and Wine are Transubstan∣tiated, (to wit) the Body and Blood of Christ the sonne of God. But Saint Augustine, as one fancying nothing lesse; Wee (saith hee)are farre from the gods of the Pagans, for ee embrace the Sacrament of Bread and Wine. This is all, and all this hee spake after Consecration.
Whereupon wee are occasioned to admonish our Christian Reader to take heed of the fraudulent practice of the Romish Sect, because of their abusing of the Writings of ancient Fa∣thers, whereof take unto you this presentEditio Paris Anno 1614 Noster panis—mysticus fit nobis [Corpus Christi] non nascitui [Whereas the direct sense is that Bread Consecrated, is not naturally bread (as it were the spicae, that is Eare of Corne, spo∣ken of by the Mani chees) but made My sticall; and Sacramen∣tall by Cōsecration.] Example. The Paris Edition An. 1555. hath the Sentence of Saint Augustine thus: Noster panis—Mysticus fit nobis, non nascitur. But the last Paris Edition Ann. 1614. hath foisted in and inserted [Corpus Christ;] albeit the sense be full without this Addition, to signifie that Common Bread is by Consecration made Mysticall or Sacramentall (according to Saint Augustines owne Exposi∣tion, saying that wee embrace the Sacrament of Bread and Cup;) and also the Phrase of [Panis fit Corpus Christi; Bread is made Christs Body] be repugnant to a common Principle of all Chri∣stianity, which never believed a Body of Christ made of Bread. So that the aforesayd Addition is not a Correcting, but a Cor∣rupting of the Text. {fleur-de-lys} The miserable straights of Romish Disputers, in answering the Definitive Sentence of Saint Augustine, concerning Christs words, of Eating his flesh; and of the Romish Shift in saying, they do but Swallow it. SECT. IV. SAintAug. de Doctr Christ. lib. 3. cap. 16. Si praeceptiva locuto flagitium aut facinus videtur jubere figu∣rata est, ut [Nisi mand averitis ca∣nem meam] facinus videtur jubere; Ergo figura est, praecipiens passioni Domini esse communicandum, & suaviter & utiliter re∣condendum in me∣mora, quia pro no∣bis caro ejus cruci∣fixa, & vulneata sit. Augustines Determination is set downe in that his one famous Sentence, for the expounding of those words of Christ [Except you eat the flesh of the Sonne of man, &c. Ioh. 6.] thus: Whensoever wee find in Scripture any speech seeming to forbid any laudable good thing, or to com∣mand any haynous evill Act, the speech is Figurative; Vt cum aicitur [Nisi manducaveritis] that is, As when it is sayd [Ex∣cept you eat my flesh:] which seemeth to command some hainous Sinne, therefore it is Figurative, commanding us to communi∣cate with Christs passion, and sweetly and profitably record in our memory, that his flesh was crucifyed and slaine for us. So Saint Augustine; which one Sentence hath beene alwayes held, of Protestants, to be convincent, for strangling of your Romish Cause. Which your Cardinall seeing as it were gasping, hasteneth to give it some short breath.Bellar. lib. 1 de Euch. cap. 7. Non vult Augustinus di∣cere, carnem Christi Tropice manducari, si essentiam manducationis spectemus, quae solum requirit, ut verus cibus ab ore traijcia∣tur in stomachum, per instrumenta vitalia; sed vult dicere Tropice manducari quoad modum, nam Ordinanus & proprius modus manducandi est, ut caro visibiliter secetur in partes, & particulatim sumatur: & cocta, non creda: Caro autem Christi sumitur integra, & invisibiliter, et sine ulla laesione sui, qua man∣ducatione figurate significamus & representamus passionem Christi. 1. probatur, quia non est scelus car∣nem Christi spirituali modo sine fuilaesione sumere. 2. quia per scelus intellig modum edendi Capernaiticum, nempe tatnem lanando. Augu∣stine
(saith hee) meant not to say that Christs flesh is eaten Tro∣pically, inrespect of an Essentiall Eating, wherein is required onely, that True meat be let downe from the mouth into the sto∣macke, by vitall Instruments: but called it a Tropicall Eating, in respect of your ordinary and proper maner of Eating, by a visible dividing of Christs flesh into parts and morsells, and that it be sod, and not raw. But Christs flesh in the Eucharist is re∣ceived whole, invisibly, and without any hurt, by which maner of Eating wee represent the Passion of Christ; which is thus proved: because First, It is no hainous sinne to eat Christs flesh Spiritually, and without hurting it; and Secondly, because Saint Auigustine understandeth by an Hainous offence, the Capernaiti∣call maner of eating thereof, namely by Tearing it in pieces. So hee. Wee must take this whole Answer in pieces, for Confutation of each particular point, lest otherwise a Gene∣rall and Briefe Answer might breed Obscurity. Your Cardinall thinketh to evade, by multiplicity of Distinctions. Ob. 1. Hee meant not Eating with Teeth, but a passing of it from the Mouth into the Stomacke. Sol. This is False, because the Apostles in their receiving of it, did use Chewing, your owne Jesuite Suarez confessing that the Sa∣cramentall Bread in Christ's time wasSee Booke 1. cap. 2. §. 2. Glutinosus: And that this maner of Tearing with Teeth had beene continued many Ages in the Church of Rome, as also used among some of your Church at this day, as hath beeneSee above Cap. 5. Sect. 4. proved. And lastly that Saint Augustine himselfe meant Eating by Tearing with Teeth, who (as theBellar lib. 1. de Euch. Cap. 7. Qui manducat corde, non qui premit dente, &c. Vbi de Sacramento loquitur, non qui premit dente, nimi∣rùm, solo. Cardinall himselfe confesseth) mentioneth theSee above, Cap 5. Sect. 5. Pressing of the Sacrament with Teeth. Secondly, Ob. But the maner of Tearing (saith hee) is not essentiall to eating, but onely the pressing of it downe into the Stomacke. So hee. Sol. Notwithstanding Pope Nicolas in his Romane Councell expresly required the Sensible Tearing of Christs flesh (as hath beene shewedSee above, Cap. 5. Sect. 5.) whereof you have also heard your IesuiteSee above, Cap. 5. Sect. 2. Salmeron confesse, saying, that Proper Eating requireth a Proper Tearing, even as your Cardinall himselfe, calling Eating, by Dividing into Parts, a Proper ma∣ner of Eating. Ob. 3. Augustine spoke of a visible Eating of Christ, and not as ours is, Invisible. Sol. As if a blinde man could not eat meat as perfectly as he that seeth. Ob. 4. But Saint Augustine understood Christs flesh Sod, and not Raw. Sol. As though the Eating of mans flesh Raw, or Sod, could distinguish a Canniball. Ob. 5. But Saint Augustine spake of Eating Christs flesh with hurting him, which appeareth by this, that hee called the maner of Eating, which hee spake of, an Hainous offence. Sol. As though yourSee above; Booke 4. Cap. 10 Sect. 5. Aquinas had not as well judged it an Hainous offence to put Christ in a Boxe, appearing in his visible shape, notwithstanding Christs No-sensible-heart
thereby. Ob. 6. But he spake against the Caper∣naiticall maner of Eating, which was Tearing it in pieces, and requireth a Spirituall order in eating; and ours is Spirituall. Sol. First as if your Eating were not Capernaiticall in any degree, which is False. Because as the Capernaites interpre∣ted Christs words in a literall sense of Eating it perfectly, so did they also conceive a Reall Swallowing of it after it had beene Eaten. And doth not your Cardinall plead here wholly for Swallowing of Christs Body? or hath not also your Iesuite Coster defined Devouring to be a Swallowing of meat without Mastication, or Tearing? Or can you deny but the PrimitiveSee before, in this Chap. 6. Fathers Detested the very conceipt of Devouring Christs flesh? And Secondly, where Saint Augu∣stine opposeth Carnal maner of Eating to the Spirituall, could hee possibly meane your Romish kind, which you professe to be a taking it into your Mouths, and by your Corporall Swallowing and Transmitting through the Throat into your Stomack, whether Visibly, or Invisibly, whether Sod, or Raw? No no, nothing lesse, but the flat Contrary, a meere Spiri∣tuall maner of Communicating of Christs passion (saith hee) and bySee  Sweetly recording in our memories his flesh once cruci∣fyed for us. Establishing this latter Eating with Minde and Heart, that hee might exclude the other of Eating with Mouth and Teeth. {fleur-de-lys} CHAP. VII. The Fourth Corporall maner of Vnion of Christ his Body, by a Bodily Mixture with the Bodies of the Communicants (professed by some Romanists at this day) is Capernaiticall. SECT. I. WEe heare your Iesuit reporting thatMulti Ca∣tholici his tempori∣bus, in odium Haere∣sis, veram praesenti∣am corporis Christ in hoc Sacramento—Sumptione ejus fieri unionem inter Corpus Christi & suscipientem, quam realm, naturalem, & substantdem, atquè eam corporalem vocant Sic Algerus, Turrecremata, Rossensis, Hosius, Turrianus, Bellarminus, Alanus.

It onely remaineth to know with what Spirit these your New Divines have thus written; yourSee above his Testimonie cited at the letter (A) Suarez. telleth us, saying, That they spake so in hatred of Heretikes (meaning Protestants) against whom they write. Who would not now magnifie the Profession of Protestants, to observe their Adversaries to be so farre transported with the Spirit of malignity and giddinesse against them, that by the just judgement of God they are be∣come
so strake blind in themselves, as that they fall into opini∣ons not onely (as is confessed) Rash and Absurd: but also Caper∣naitically-Hereticall?

Two kind of Semblances are to be Observed, one in their like Hyperbolicall Phrasing, concerning Baptisme; and the other touching our Conjunction with Christ.
Of Baptisme, Hilarie the VI. objected, saith, Christians by Baptisme, which is one, are made one, not onely in affection, but also in nature. Leo the V. objected, saith also that By Bap∣tisme the Body of the Regenerate is made the flesh of Christ cruci∣fyed. And furthermore marke what your Cardinall Tolet hath collected from Augustine, namely thatTolet. Com. in Iob.  Anot. 26. Dcet Augustimus lib. 1. de Pec merit.

Infants, by being Baptized, are made partakers of the Eucharist, because they are Members of the Mysticall Body, and are so made in a sort partakers of this Sacrament, (that is to say) of the thing signifyed, Eating his flesh, and Drinking his Blood. So hee. By which your Objectour must be inforced to admit a like Reall Conjunction, and Consequently of a Reall presence of Christ in Baptisme, as they have for the Bodily Vnion and Pre∣sence of Christ in and by the Eucharist.

As by the one Christians are made partakers of Christs flesh, so by that other are men made partakers with Devils. So Primasius. Wherefore your Disputers, by comparing these Sentences of the Fathers with the former, if they shall take them as spoken properly, and not Sacramentally and Figuratively, shall be compelled to allow proper Commixtures and nourishings of mans soule, by the word. First, a proper Mingling of Gods spirit with Man. Secondly, a proper Incorporating of man into Christ; and a proper Mixture of Man with Devils. And againe upon due Comparison of the Testimonies of Fathers, ob∣jected by you, with these now alleged by us, concerning the Eucharist it selfe, it will necessarily follow, that by the same reason, wherewith you have sought to prove one kind of Proper presence of Christs Body, and Transubstantiation, and Vnions you must allowAugust.

Fathers, as being, in your Choice, More speciall, because that all your Disputers, whensoever they produce them, for proofe of your Romish Doctrine of Corporal Vnion, they esteeme them Insoluble above all others; Insomuch that one of your Doctors, after hee had objected the Sentences of Irenaeus, Greg. Nyssen, Damascen, Leo, and Saint Augustine, no sooner nameth the Sentence of Hilarie, but prefaceth of it, saying; This is a more notable Place. Another concludeth the Doctrine of Cyril to be so abso∣lutely Romish, that he accounteth Protestants no better than Men sold over to the Devill, for not assenting to your Com∣mon Interpretation of him. But this Flash of your Doctor will appeare to be but an Ignis fatuus, or a Blind Zeale with∣out knowledge, when wee come to this Particular. In the Interim, that you may know wee meane to deale clearely, wee First grant unto you the Scope of either of these two Fathers, in their Discourses. Hilarius sought to confute the Arian Heretikes by defending a Naturall Vnion of the Godhead of Christ, the sonne of God, with God the Father. Cyril intended to convince the Nestorian Here∣tikes, for proofe of an Hypostaticall Vnion of the two Na∣tures, Godhead and Manhood, in one person of Christ. Se∣condly, wee grant that both the Fathers, together with that Generall Councel at Ephesus, call the Flesh of Christ, which Christians participate in this Sacrament, [Vivificatricem,] that is, Vivificall, or giving life to the Receivers, even unto Immortality. Thirdly wee grant, that they name our Con¦junction of Christ by this Sacrament to be, not onely an Vnion in Affection and Concord, but also a Naturall and Cor∣porall
Conjunction of the Body of Christ with the Bodie of the Communicants. And Lastly wee grant, that one of them addeth a Similitude of the Vnion of Waxemelted with Waxe. And yet notwithstanding all these our Acknow∣ledgements and Grants, wee presume to affirme, that all these Testimonies teach, indeed, a Mysticall, not your Ro∣mish Missaticall Vnion, by a properly Corporall Touch of Christs owne naturall Body, with the Bodies of the Recei∣vers. Our ground is the same, which wee have often layd in our former Confutations (to wit) by paralleling this Vnion of the Eucharist (as it is to be seene in the Margin) with other Vnions mentioned by both these same Fathers, in as Aequivalent and Equipollent termes (equally named by them both) Naturall and Corporall; albeit voyd of any Corporall Touch of the Body of Christ, as you your selves will grant. For the Instances, used by these Fathers, are divers, Some consist onely in Relation, and some in Application also. The Instance given in the Relative onely, is in respect of the Incarnation of Christ, when hee tooke the same nature of our flesh upon him; which Relation of a Christian mans flesh
with the Humane flesh of Christ, is universally in all persons, at all times (even without this Sacrament) called by Hilarie, [Vnio Corporalis Nativitatis Christi] that is, an Vnion wrought by Christ his Incarnation in our flesh, being the same Specifi∣cally with his; and notwithstanding it is called by him an Vnion Naturall and Corporall, and not onely the Vnion of Will and Affection, albeit voyd of all Bodily Touch. Next of the Vnions made by Application, some are Spiri∣tually onely, and some are Sacramentall also. Of the Spi∣rituall Vnion (which is also free from all Bodily Touch) they say of Christ, and of True Christians, that they are Vnited by the Vnity of Faith; which notwithstanding is likewise called by him, a Corporall Vnion, and not onely in Will and Af∣fection. I come to the Sacramentall Vnion. Some of this kind are found in other Sacraments, and some in the Eucha∣rist it selfe. Of others it is indefinitely here sayd, that Chri∣stians are united by the Sacraments, and namely (as is confes∣sed) The Regenerat, by Baptisme, have an Vnion Corporall with Christ, and not onely in Affection and Concord: albeit this also be (as you know) exempted from all Bodily Touch. Accordingly of the Vnions made by the Eucharist; Some are of Christians among themselves; and some of Christ with us. Of the former, the Vnion of the faithfull Com∣municants, as the Members of Christ, is named by them a Naturall and Corporall Vnion, and not onely in Concord, although (as you know) this can be no coincident Corpo∣rall Touch of their Body reciprocally. Thus these holy Fathers. And now that you may under∣stand, from them, Foure several Vnions, One Relative; Ano∣ther Spirituall; A third Sacramentall in Generall; And a Fourth (as I may say) Eucharisticall; (peculiar onely to the Sacrament of the Eucharist) all of them equally named of these Fathers Corporall and Naturall Vnions, and not Vnions of Affection and Concordonely; notwithstanding each one of the former Three exclude all Bodily Touch. Wee demand therefore why all these Foure, being named Naturall and Corporall, Improperly, onely the last should inferre a Reall Corporall Touch of Christs Body, by the virtue of the same words, Naturall, or Corporall? Your Cardinall giveth his maine reason;Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 12. A∣liud esse, apud Hila∣rium, aliqua esse u∣num naturaliter, a∣liud autem, unum esse in alio naturali∣ter. Nam ut aliqua sint unum naturali∣ter, satis est, si verè participent naturam ipsius rei, in qua sunt unum: & hoc modo dicit ipse omnes fide∣les esse unum natu∣raliter per fidem—sed ut unum sit in alio naturaliter—necesse est, ut natura unius, merè sit in a∣lio: & hoc modo—Christum esse in nobis per carnem naturaliter; quia na∣tura carnis ejus no∣bis vere unitur per Eucharistiam. It is not the same thing with Hilarie (saith hee) Some things to be one Naturally; and to be one in another Naturally: For things to be one Naturally, it is sufficient, if both of them partake truly of the Nature of the thing wherein they are one; and so hee calleth all Christians one Natu∣rally by Faith. But to be one Naturally [In] another, it is ne∣cessary that the Nature of the one be meerely within the Nature of the other: and so (in the meaning of Hilarie) is Christs Bo∣dy
sayd to be Naturally within ours by the Eucharist. This is your Cardinalls Ground of Assoilement, whereupon hee relyeth as on a Rocke, immoveable; which will instantly prove as wavering as a Reed; both False and Fond; (as you may finde in the Marginalls.) For Hilarie speaking of one of the other Vnions, which hee calleth Naturall, by reason of Christs Incarnation, in taking our nature of Flesh upon him, saith that wee are [In him.] Therefore is your Cardinalls Distinction False. Next of the very Sacramentall Vnion, whereof it is sayd, that Christ is [Naturally In us,] it is also as expressely sayd, that wee are likewise [Naturally In Christ.] But none can affirme, that Wee, in true propriety of speech, are Naturally in the Body of Christ. Therefore is his Answer most Absurd. But you will aske, how then can this stand with the scope of the same Fathers, for the Confuting of the two former Divers Heresies, by an Onely Symbolicall and Mysticall Conjunction with the Body of Christ? First thus; By our Eating and Drinking in this Sacrament (according to Christs Institution) is professed a Vivificall flesh of Christ, giving eternall life un∣to the world; which (as these Fathers truly teach) it could not do, if it were the Flesh of a meere man: And therefore he is, by Nature, God; one with God the Father. Ergò Avant! Thou Arian-Heretike. The Second thus; The same Humane flesh of Christ would not have the same divine Vivifical power and virtue, except it were perfectly Vnited to his Godhead; and therefore is Christ both God and Man; and that not by Relation of two different Persons onely, but by an Hypo∣staticall Vnion of two Natures. Ergo thou Nestorian Heretike Recant. The meaning of these holy Fathers is transparent enough, by their owne Sentences, as is now proved; which if it nee∣ded any further Illustration, might be manifested by the like Testimonies of that Great Athanasius, who, from this Ar∣ticle, of Christ his Incarnation onely, whereby his Godhead assumed our nature of flesh, spared not to say:Athanasius Tom. 1. Orat. 4. Con∣tra Arianos, pag 487. . that By his flesh, thus assumed of the word, (God) wee men are Dei∣fyed and made Gods. So hee; without any Relation to the Sacrament at all. And againe, when he spake of the same Ar∣ticle of Christs Incarnation, he hath Relation to a Sacrament, and saith as much of Baptisme, as either Hilarie or Cyril did of the Eucharist.Ibidem. pag. 486. . Wee, (saith hee) being borne againe of water and the holy Ghost, are all made alive by Christ; and our flesh is no more Earthly, but now by that [word, God] Wordi∣fyed, and made the same by him, that for us was made flesh. So hee. And so, according to the Romish presumption of Arguing, from the like words of the Fathers, concerning
the Eucharist, Athanasius must be sayd to have judged of Baptisme. I. That the Substance of water is changed. II. That by it, there is a Corporall Vnion properly with the Bodies of the Baptized. III. That by the same, the Flesh of the Bapti∣zed is made the Word, God. Which nothing but Stupidity could conceive, or Impudencie utter, or else Obstinacie de∣fend. The miserable Vnconscionablenesse of the Romish Objecturs made clearely Discernable, by their owne Confessions, in granting that the Formerly alleged Testimonies of the Fathers are Not to be taken in a Literall Sense. SECT. III. ALl the Questions betweene your Romish Disputers and Vs (concerning the Speeches of the Fathers, objected by them, through the whole Treatise of the Masse, for proofe of a Bodily Presence) is, whether they are to be taken Literally and Properly, as they sound to the eare; or Impro∣perly and Figuratively, as they are to be apprehended by our understandings, in a qualifyed Sacramentall and Mysti∣cal Signification. And whether you can conclude from them a Properly (so called) Corporall Vnion with his sacred Body; whether by a Corporall Touch and Tast, Mixture, or Nutri∣tion and Augmentation thereby, or no. You have heard your Doctors object against Vs the naked and Symbolicall Phrases of the Fathers: will you be so good as heare them againe, both relating the Expositions, which the Protestants make of the words of the Fathers objected, and afterwards enforced, by good evidence, to interpret the Fathers accor∣dingly. These you Doctors certifie you (see the Margin) that Calvin indeed Expoundeth each phrase as spoken by an excesse and exuberancie of speech, for extolling, and commending the Dignity of the Sacrament. So hee, of Calvin. Likewise of your owne Romish Doctors (saith your Vasquez) Some of the Vniversity of Complutum in Spaine, did interpret the words of the Fathers, as spoken Hyperbolically. And if you shall reject these, as the meaner Some; wee shall enquire in∣to other Some, of better eminencie. As namely your Bellar∣mine, and Tolet, both Cardinalls: your Suarez, and even Vasquez himselfe, all Iesuits in their Times. Let them (wee pray you) make their owne Answers in order, as they have beene Cited. First Bellarmine;Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 4 §. Se∣cundo Respondeo. (Wherein also hee expoundeth the like words of Iustin.) Non est novum apud Ite∣naeum, Hilarium, Nyssenum, Cyril∣lum, & alios, ut Eu charistia dicatur ale∣re corpora nostra, sed non intelligunt Pa∣tres, cum hoc dicunt, Eucharistiâ nutriri vel augeri mortalem substantiam corporis nostri; sic enim fa∣cerent Eucharistiam cibum ventris, non mentis, qu nihil absurdius fingi possit. It is ordinary (saith hee) with these Fathers, to wit, Irenaeus,
Hilarie, Nyssen, Cyril, and others, to say that the Eucharist nou∣risheth our Bodies: But they did not understand a Substantiall nutrition, or augmentation of our Bodies; for so they should make it to be meat for the Belly, and not for the soule, than which nothing could be feigned more Absurd. So hee. Cardinall Tolet is the Second, wee desire to heare his Judgement.Tolet. in Ioh. cap. 6. Annot. 29. Cum dicunt Hilar & Cyril nostra corpora habere unionem cor∣poralem & natura∣lem cum corpore Christ, Doctores i non sunt ita intelli∣gendi, ut velin ex Christo sumpto & su∣mene fieri unū Ens naturale, indigna est illis Doctrina) sed hoc dicere voluerunt, praeter unionem, quae ratione charitatis & fidei sit, adesse intra nos ipsos verè & rea∣liter Christum ipsū, qui causa est fidei e∣jusdem. These Fa∣thers (saith hee) Cyril and Hilarie, when they tell us, that wee have a Corporall and Naturall Vnion with Christs Body in the Sacrament, are not to be understood, as if our Bodies and Christs Body were made one, in Entity: this were a Doctrine unworthy of them; but they meant of the Vnion of Faith and Affection, Christ being within us Really, as the Cause thereof. So he. Observe that Cardinall Tolet noteth the Fathers to have sayd, that the Bodies of the Communicants and the Body of Christ, by this Sacrament, have One naturall Being; because of their other Sayings, that by eating of this Sacrament our Bodies are Nou∣rished and Augmented by Christs Body. All which are spoken in a Sacramentall tenour of speech, and not properly, as you heare. Francis Suarez his Course is next;Suarez. in 3. Tho. qu. 79. Disp 64. Sect. 3. Nihilominus haec sententia impro∣babilis, & aliena dig∣nitate & majestate hujus Sacramēti, quod non propter corpora∣lem conjunctionem, sed propter spiritua∣lem institutum est, dicente Christo, Mea verba spiritus sunt & vita. Ioh. 6. [See a∣bove, Chap. 7. Sect. 2. at the letter f.] Sua∣rez. Damascen. lib. 4 cap. 14. Hoc Sacra∣mento—nos Christi concorporei existimus—& animo & voluntate copulamur. Cyril. Hierosol. Catechis. 4. Mystag. Sumpto corpore & sanguine Christi efficimur comparticipes corporis & sanguinis, ,—cum ejus sanguinem & corpus in nostra membra receperimus, arquè ita (ut B. Peius dicit) Divinae naturae consortes efficimur. [Hinc Suarez:] Vbi propter Sacramentalem susceptionem, non agnoscit aliam unionem praeter spiritualem per gratiam, &c. In 3. Tho. qu. 79. Disp. 64. quo supra. I say (saith he) that Cardinall Mendoza is reported to have taught (namely, as out of the Fathers) that Christ's Body is so united with our Bo∣dies, that they are both joyntly mingled in parts, one with another. Which is an Opinion Improbable, and unworthy of the Majesty and Dignity of the Sacrament, which was instituted by Christ, not for a Corporall, but for a Spirituall Conjunction: and the other Con∣junction is False and Absurd. So he. Gabriell Vasquez is now to take his turne, first to make his Preface, and then to deliver his Opinion.Vas∣quez in 3. Thom. quaest. 79. Art. 2. Disp. 204. cap. 2. Tametsi Antiqui Ecclesiae Patres in exponendis mysterijs nostrae fidei, insolita, & paum in Scholis usitata ratione dicendi interdum utantur, ita tamen eorum verba & sententias accipere debemus, ut licet primo aspectu aliquid Absurdi continere videantur, nihil tamen contra ipsos; nisi maturo consilio & examine, aliorumque patrum, aut conciliorum testimonijs nixi pronunciemus. Ibid. cap. 3. Aliqui omnia Patrum Testimonia, quae allegavimus, per figuram Hyperbolen interpretantur; ut ita Patres virtutem jujus Sacramenti eximiè commendare viderentur: non quôd revera fieret ita. Ex Haereticis hoc mo∣do testimonia Hilarij & Cyrilli interpretatus est Calvinus.—Neque defuerunt Complutenses aliqui, qui eodem modo per Hyperbolen illa explicarent—Ibid. cap. 4. Quidam putarunt, si sine Hyperbole explica∣rentur, sequi, ut caro Christi per omnem partem corporis nostri dissunderetur, ut cera cerae lique facta—at non sic dissunditur—Cyrillus usus est hac similitudine ad ostendendam veram & realem mixtionem corpo∣ris nostri cum corpore Christi, non tamen quoad dissusionem eam similitudimen locum habere putabat—Nec enim est Physics unio carnis nostrae cum carne Christi, sicut ex duabus ceris, neque fieri unam carnm per conversionem unius in alteram, sicut fit in nutritione animalis naturali, neque id ullus sanae mentis, ullo modo assereret. Although the Ancient Fathers, in expounding these mysteries of Faith, use words not so usuall in our Schooles, yet ought wee to interpret their speeches so, that although at the first sight they containe some Absurdity, yet not to take them contrary to their meaning without due advise, and that relying upon Testimonies of Antiquity. So hee. And for Instances hee bringeth divers, and
more particularly that Similitude of Conjunction, already ob∣jected out of Cyrl; As waxe with waxe melted are joyned toge∣ther. And this (if it be taken in the Rigidity of the words) hee denyeth to note either Diffusion of Christs Body into the parts of mans Body, or else a Substantiall Conversion into them. All these acknowledgements being so plaine and ingenuous, and delivered with so full an Assurance and Resolution of your owne Doctors, of most exquisite judgement above Others in your Church, do minister unto us matter of Astonishment, to wonder with what Consciences they could urge us with these Sentences of the Fathers, as they goe under a Literall habit and propriety of Speech; seeing that now, after some Delibe∣ration, they find the same to be so glowing hot, that they them∣selves, not daring to touch them with their bare fingers, take hold of them with a Distinction, as it were with a paire of Tongs, saying, thatSuarez. in 3. Thom. qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 64. Sect. 3. Ex∣istimo omnino cer∣tum, praeter conta∣ctum corporis nostri & Christi, medijs speciebus Sacramen∣talibus, non interve∣nire materialem ali∣quam unionem phy∣sicam & veram. Because there is no Naturall Conjunction between Christs Body and ours, excepting onely a Touch of the one by the other, under formes of Bread: The Vnion, spoken of by the Fa∣thers, is not Physicall, or Naturall, but Spirituall. So Suarez. Not Physicall, or Naturall, but Metaphoricall. So Vasquez. But yet how Mysticall it is, this will be handled in the next Section. Can there then be any thing more Odious or Vnjust, than for your Disputers to proclame their Adversaries Heretikes, for expounding the aforesayd Sentences of the Fathers, in an unproper Sense; which liberty, They themselves both now have practised, and also instructed Others to doe the like by their owne words and examples? wherein as they are gene∣rally found Contradictory to themselves, so are they more particularly one to another. For Doctor Heskins objecting the Sayings of Chrysostome and Cyril, concerning the Conjunction of Christs Body with ours, to be like as when Waxe is melted with waxe in one Vnion, Hee himselfe waxed wroth with Protestants so farre, as to iudge them Men given over to the Devill, because they did not believe them according to the outward letter. Notwithstanding your owne Vasquez (as you have heard) taught that the same words cannot be admitted in the strict∣nesse of the Termes; as also your Suarez and Tolet in saying, that to Interpret them Literally, were to detract from the Wis∣dome of those Fathers, and from the Dignity and Majesty of the Sacrament itselfe. Lastly, albeit yourVide Bellar. quo supra de Euchar. lib. 2. cap. 13. supra ci∣tat. Bellarmine presseth much this Testimony of Cyril, wherein the Christian Com∣municants are called , that is, Cariers of Christ; yet your Suarez expounding this, and that other of Damascen, calling them , that is, Ioynt Bodies with Christ, and so partakers of the Divine Nature; alloweth no more in the Continuance of this Carying of Christs Body, and Vnion therewith, but onely a Spirituall, that is, of Grace and Affection.
That the Former Objected Testimonies of the Fathers, make flatly against the Romish Faith of a proper Corporall Conjunction and Mixture of Christs Body with the Bodies of the Communicants, in two more especiall Points. SECT. IV. ALl the Bodily Conjunction of Christ with the Bodies of the Communicants, which your Romish aith tea∣cheth, consisteth onely in a Mutuall Contactus or Touch of his Body with theirs, as your Iesuites every where teach. Our Observables hereupon, at this present, are especially two. One in respect of the Time of Continuance of the same Vnion: The other in respect of the Persons united toge∣ther. Of the former, you professe by yourVasquez. in 3. Tho. qu 7. Art. 2. cap 4 Disp. 204 Chri∣stus tamdiu est in no∣bis, quamdiu specis in nobis incorruptae perseverant, at{que} ex∣tra eas non est, ante∣quam corrumpantur. Jesuite, that Christ is but onely so long in the Bodies of the Receivers, as the formes of Bread and Wine do continue uncorrupt. And, concer∣ning the Persons, you hold of this your Bodily Vnion (as your Suarez. in 3. Tho qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 64. Sect. 3. Quo∣ad hoc, unio haec cō∣munis est peccatori∣bus indignè man∣ducanibus Corpus Christi. Suarez relateth) that It is common to the wicked, and to the faithfull Communicants of the Body of Christ. So you. And now (O you great pretenders of Antiquity!) behold a Torrent of Ancient Fathers against you, both in respect of Continuance of Time, and of the Difference of Persons: to wit, Irenaeus, Origen, Chrysostome, Hierome, Ambrose, Au∣gustine, Hilarie, Cyril of Alexandria (under the Confession of your forenamed Jesuites, to whom wee may adjoyne both Basil, and Theodoret) acknowledging, that whereas the Vnion which you believe to have with Christs Body in this Sacrament, onely by Bodily Touch, is Transient, during Suarez. quo supra. Sancti (Patres) non loquuntur de u∣nione Transeunte, ut sic dicam, cum speci∣ebus Sacramētalibus, sed permanente & Durabili. no longer, than the formes of Bread and Wine, eaten and transmitted into the stomacke of the Eater, are uncorrupt, (this Conjunction being indeed momentary,) They, I say, do contrarily teach a Conjunction absolutely Permanent, even to Immortality it selfe. And againe, your Romish Conjunction being Common to the wickedest of men, and this Conjunction, spoken of by the Fathers, beingVasquez. in 3. Tho qu. 79. Art. 2. Disp. 204. cap 3. Vnio quam Patres consti∣tuunt inter nostram carnem & carnem Christi, tamdiu ma∣net, quamdiu a Cha∣ritate Christi non se∣paramur. Proper onely to the Godly and Faithfull, who are joyned together in Faith with Christ, and in Charity with all Christians (which therefore you your selves call a Suarez quo supra. Non est haec unio corporalis aut Physica, sed spiritua∣lis & Mystica. Et Vasquez. quo supra. Neque aliam quam moralem & mysti∣cam, Paties, inter carnem nostram & carnem Christi, in∣telligi voluerunt. Morall and Mysticall Vnion:) It followeth in both these Respects, that you may easily deserne in your Romish Faith notable degeneration from the Judgement of Anti∣quity. The seeming Contradictions of the former Spee∣ches of the Fathers will be reconciled in the next Chapter, and the Third Section.
CHAP. IX. Of the Second kind of Objections out of the Fathers, from their Similitudes, especially insisted upon by Romish Sophisters, because of their calling Christ both Feast and Guest, and the Eucharist Viands and Pledge; Confuted by the like language of the same Fathers, in respect of other things. SECT. I. LEt us looke downe to the Idiome and language of the Fathers, and compare their Sayings to∣gether, and wee shall finde these Testimonies no lesse vehemently, than violently and uncon∣scionably objected.Hier Epist. 15. ad Hebdidiam, objected by Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. cap. 23. and Doctor Heskins cap. 53. and others. Do∣minus Iesus, ipse est conviva, & convivi∣um: ipse comedens & qui comeditur:—illius bibimus san∣guinem, & sine illo potare non possimus—& quotidie in Sacrificijs ejus ex ge∣nimine verae vitis, & vineae Sore, quae in∣terpretatur electa, ru∣bentia musta calca∣mus, & novum ex ijs bibimus vinum—in ecclesia, quod reg∣num patris est. Hierome is alleged, as calling Christ both Feast and Guest, (namely) by giving this Sacrament to be Eaten of others, and Eating it himselfe: which you (for proofe of his Corporall Presence in the Eu∣charist) Interpret to be Properly understood. But wee say not Properly, but Figuratively and Vnproperly, even as well as are his words following, where hee nameth our Drinking Christs Blood, the Pressing out, with the feet, the elect and cho∣sen Vines: as also, in calling the Church of Christ, the Kingdome of the Father. Might not these his latter Improper Phrases of Speech have beene cleare Spectales unto you, to Diserne the like Impropriety in the former? The same Answer may be given to the like objected speech of Chry∣sostome, concerning ChristsAnd Chryso∣stome also by Doctor Heskins (See in the Section following.) Eating himselfe, which is, toge∣ther with the former, to be Discussed in the next Section following. In the Second place, the Eucharist is called in the Greeke In Liturgijs, ut patet ex Casaubon. Exerc. 16. cap. 52. . And Liturgies, and in the Councell ofConc. Ni∣cen. can 13. Si quis egreditur de corpore, ultimo & necessario viatico non privetur, &c. Nice, the Viati∣cum, that is Viand, or Provision for our Travell in our way to Life everlasting. A word objected by yourAquinas part. 3. quaest. 73. Art. 4. Hoc Sacramentum est praefigurativum fruitionis Dei, quae erit in patria, ideo dictum viaicum quia hic praebet nobis vi∣am illu perveniendi. Aquinas and others, which notwithstanding can prove no more for your (properly) Corporall Receiving the Eucharist, than it can for receiving the same Corporally in Baptisme, which is cal∣led byBasil. Exhort. ad Baptismum, De Baptisme sic monet Iuvenem; . Basil andNazian. Orat. 40. de Baptismo, vult morientem . Gregorie Naxianzene our Viaticum. (See theGahrie. Albispin. Episc. lib. Observat. 11. Qui hoc viaticum in omnibus Canonibus Eucharistiam interpretantur, non mious labantur—cum tot sint genera viatici, quot sunt modi & viae ad Ecclesiae com∣munionem obtinendam—Consideres nihil aliud dici viaticum, nisi quod in morte sumitur, & in alteram vitam proficiscenti prodesse potest. At Baptismus & Absolutio, quando morientibus impartiuntur, quid ni vi∣atica censeri possint? Margin.)
The Third is the Title of Pledge, which yourBellar. lib. 2.  cap. 17. ex Optato. Optatus vo∣cet Eucharist.  fidei, et spem Resur∣rectionis▪ Car∣dinall hath urged out of Optatus, naming the Eucharist, the Pledge of Salvation, helpe of Faith, and hope of our Re∣surrection. Which are (say wee) delivered in the same Te∣or, and sense of speech, whereinBasil exhort. ad Baptis. Baptismus nam{que} ad resurrecti∣onem facultas quae∣dam et aabo, &c. Basil, andTheodoret. in Divinorum Decreto∣rum Epitome de Bap∣tismo. Baptismus est pignus et Aa futu∣rorū bonorum, et fu∣turae Resurrectionis. The∣odoret termed Baptisme, the Pledge and Earnest of Blessings to come, and of our future Resurrection. The Common Idome of Antiquity being so frequent and familiar, equally for Baptisme, as for the Eucharist; who can but admire the Bold∣nesse of our Adversaries, in their so instant pressing and in∣culcating of those former Sentences, which cannot be more earnestly Objected for the one, than they may be easily Confuted by the other; as will be more conspicuous in our Relation in the next Section following. That the former Objected Sentences of Antiquity, concerning Feast and Guest, &c. Viand and Pledge, do, in them∣selves, altogether Confute your Romish Pretence, to the further manifestation of the Vncon∣scionablenesse of your Romish Disputers. SECT. II. CHrist, by Saint Hierome (as you have heard) is said, in receiving this Sacrament at his first Institution thereof, to have beene both Convivium, and Convivam, that is, both Feast and Guest, Eating his owne Body. And your Doctor Heskins Instaneth in the like speech of Chrysostome, saying: thatDr. Heskins in his Parliament of Christ. Book. 2. cap 55. objected out of Chry∣sostome in Matth 26. Hom. 83. Ipse quo{que} orbit ex eo, ne  bis illis dicerent; Quid  sangui∣m bibimus et car∣nem  ac ideo perurbarentur—Ne igitur tunc quo{que} id accideret, primus ipse  fe∣cit, ut Tranqulo a∣nimo ad communi∣cationem mysterio∣rum induceret. Christ himselfe dranke thereof in the behalfe of his Disciples, lest they should be troubled with his words of [Eating his Flesh, and Drinking his Blood] therefore did hee himselfe first receive, that hee might induce them to take it with a Quiet Minde. So Chrysostome; whom your Doctor allegeth for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ; and then applying himselfe to his Reader, Now you have heard (saith hee) the mind of Chrysostome upon the words of Christ, and by the same also, you may know, both how He, and how also the Apostles (who first received the Cup at Christs hand) did believe. So hee. And wee shall as willingly subscribe to the Orthodoxe mea∣ning of Hierome and Chrysostome (for they Both agree in one.) Thus then, Christ must have beene a Guest and Feast him∣selfe unto himselfe, in Eating his owne Body, either Naturally, or Spiritually, or Romishly, or else Sacramentally. But not Na∣turally, to have his Body fed by the same his owne Body; for this Conceipt, in yourSee above. own Judgement, is Absurd. Nor Spi∣ritually;
Because hee needeth not any Spirituall helpe of any Sacrament, for nourishing or augmenting any Grace in his Soule. Nor yet Romishly, by a Bodily Touch (which is your Professed Corporall Vnion;) Because it was never heard, that any man was fed and feasted by an onely Touch. A Bul∣let, (for example) transmitted into the Belly, doth Touch, not feed: Nutrition and Feeding being, Properly, a Sub∣stantiall Change of a thing Nourishable, into the Substance of the Body Nourished. And againe, what can be more grosse, than to imagine (albeit but in a Dreame) of a man Eating with his Mouth, his owne Mouth; Swallowing with his Throat, his owne Throat; Disgesting with his Stomacke, his owne Stomacke? All which Consequences follow upon a mans wholly Eating his owne Body. Therefore must wee apprehend such Speeches of the Fa∣thers in a fourth sense, to wit, Sacramentally, by attributing the name of the Thing unto the Signe, as wee teach; which sense the Objected Testimony of Chrysostome doth con∣firme unto us: who saith not, that Christ Dranke or Ate himselfe; but that hee dranke of the Passeover, lest they that heard him should say, What shall wee drinke his Blood? which is as much as if Chrysostome had directly sayd, that Christ therefore dranke of the Cup, that they, seeing him drinke, might thereby understand, that Hee did no more drinke his owne Blood, than Hee, in Eating, did appeare to Eat his owne Flesh. Hee therefore Dranke (saith Chrysostome) lest they should be troubled to thinke; what? what, but that hee Dranke his owne Blood? which sense of Chrysostomes the sentence it selfe doth evince: lest that (saith hee) they should say within themselves, Shall wee drinke his Blood? Such In∣terrogative speeches (as your owne Schoole teaches you) have Vim Negationis, that is, imply a Negation, and import as much, as to thinke that Christ did not Drinke his owne Blood. Will you have any more? Chrysostome explayning the words of Christ, Ioh. 6. of Eating his Flesh, and Drin∣king his Blood, giveth all Christians a Caveat, not to under∣stand them Carnally;Chrysost. in Ioh. 6. Hom. 46. Quid est carnaliter intelli∣gere? simpliciter ut res dicuntur, neque aliud quippiam exco∣gitate. And what is it (saith hee) to understand them Carnally? even to understand them simply, as they are spoken, and not conceive any thing else. The Atribute of Viaticum is next, which having so great Consanguinity with the Communion by feeding, may af∣ford us the same Reason of Retorting the same Argument (borrowed from the same word) upon your Objectors them∣selves, which wee permit to your owne wits to examine, that with more Brevity wee may descend to the last Ad∣junct, which is, a Pledge of our Resurrection to Immortality, which hath beene applyed by your Cardinall as peculiar to
the Eucharist, to prove a Corporall presence of Christ therein; It being a Terme taken from the mouth of the Father Opta∣tus, whom wee have answered out of two Fathers, Basil and Theodoret, who have as well given the same word [Pledge of our Resurrection to Immortality] unto the Sacrament of Bap∣tisme. From whom it may be yourCosterus. See above, Booke 4. ca. 10. §. 5. Jesuite Coster borrowed his Assertion, where hee also nameth Baptisme, the Pledge of our Resurrection to life everlasting; which one word [Pledge,] now Objected by you, will prove as good as Bellerophon's Letters to confute your selves, and to vanquish your Romish Defence, even from the nature of a Pledge, as it is applyed to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, by three Fathers. I. Hierome,Hieron. See above, Booke 3. Ca. 3. §. 11. Christ (saith he) left this his last memoriall of his Passion, like as one that is travailing into a strange Coun∣try, leaveth a Pledge with his friend for a memorandum of his benefits. II. Gaudentius thus:Gaudent. See above, Booke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 1. at (). Christ (saith hee) being about to be Crucifyed, left that Hereditary gift of the new Te∣stament, as a Pledge of his Presence. And III. Primasius, concerning the Institution of this Sacrament saith, that Primas. in 1. Cor. 11. Salvator Deus exemplum de∣dit, ut quotiescunquè hoc facimus in mente habeamus, quod Christus pro nobis mortuus est, ideo no∣bis dicitur Corpus Christi, ut cum hoc recordati fuerimus, non simus ingrati gratiae ejus. Quemad∣modum si quis mori∣ens relinquat ei, quem diligit, aliquod pignus, quod ille post mortem ejus quan∣docunque viderit, nunquid potest la∣chrymas continere si perfectè dilexerit? Christ left us an example, that as often as wee celebrate this, wee should call to remembrance that Christ dyed for us. And therfore is it called the Body of Christ, (saith hee) that, as often as wee remember, wee be not ingrate and unthankfull to his gratiousnesse; like as when one, Dying, leaveth a Pledge of remembrance unto his friend. All these holy Fathers (you see) interpret this Sacrament to be unto us as a Present Pledge of a Friend Absent, whether hee be a living Travailer, or one departed this life. Primasius his Observation of the [Pledge] is very remarkable, when hee saith of this Sacrament (thus called a Pledge) that It is Therefore called the Body of Christ, giving the name of the Thing to the Token thereof; than which Similtude what can be more pregnant and pertinent for the Confuting of your Tridentine Faith, concerning the Corporall Presence of Christ in the Eucharist? Seeing now that the Ancient Fa∣thers have shewne themselves Patrons and Favourers of our Cause, it will become us, as true Children, to do them right. To which purpose wee adde, and shew That the Seeming Contradictory Sayings of the Fathers are Reconcilable in themselves; and yet Re∣pugnant to the Romish Profession. SECT. III. FOr our making good of this Section, it will be required that wee performe it so, that the Doctrine of the Fathers
(notwithstanding this Reconciliation) may appeare to be both Adverse to the Romish Corporall Conjunction; and al∣so agreeable to our Protestant sense, as well in respect of the Sacramentall, as of the Spirituall Conjunction, which the Receiver of this Sacrament hath with the Body of Christ. The Repugnancie of the Fathers to the Romish Corporall Conjunction. Sometimes the Fathers are found, in this Sacrament, to speake , that is Exactly and precisely, and sometime , and , Improperly. When they speake of a Corporall Conjunction with Christs Body, Exactly and sim∣ply so taken, so often they appeare to deny it absolutely from point to point. As I. by theirAmbros. Serm. 58. in illud Christi ad Magdalen. [Noli me tangere.]—Ergò eum non super terram, nec in terra, nec secundum carnem, debemus quaerere Salvatorem. No Bodily Touc of Christ after his Resurrection. So Ambrose. II.Aug. Non dentis cibus. Idem. Serm. 33. de verbis Dom. Nolite parare fances, sed cor. No met for Teeth. So Augustine. Nor For the Iawes. So the same Father. III.Attalas Martyr. See above. Not to be devoured with Throat. So At∣talas the Martyr. IV.Cyprian de Coena Dom. Non ventris cibus. Not for the Belly. So Cyprian. V.Idem de Coe∣na Dom De unione nostra cum Christo in hoc Sacramento. Ad participationem spiritus, non usque ad Consubstantiali∣tatem—nostra & ipsius conjunction, non miscet personas, neque unit substan∣tias, sed affectus con∣sociat, & confoede∣rat voluntates. Not for Bodily Conjunction of Persons, nor for Vnion of Substances. So also the same Father. VI.Cyril. Hie∣rosol. See above, Booke 4. cap. 10 § 3. Not to be cast into the Draught. So Cyrill of Hierusalem. Whereunto you may adde, as the Complexion and Comprehension of all the rest, that of Chrysostome concerning this Sacrament. Chrysost. See above. ; that is, Having no fleshly thing, nor yet that hath any Natural Consequence thereof, namely of fleshly Vnion. In wch you have all as at Negatives to your Romish Corporall Vnion, by your Bodily Touch, whe∣ther by Hand, Mouth, or Belly, as the Ancient Fathers could have given, if they had concluded their Judgements in a Synod. But how then (will you say) did they speake so ex∣pressely of an Vnion, by Touching, Eating, Tearing, and of your Corporall Conjunction, even unto the Feeding thereby▪ This is the next Doubt, which wee are now to assoyle, in the next Section. The meaning of the words of the Ancient Fathers is fully Consonant to the Doctrine of Protestants. SECT. IV. THe Sacramentall Vnion, which Protestants teach, (be∣sides that which they call Spirituall) consisteth wholly in the Resemblance, which is betweene the Body of Christ, and the Substance of Bread and Wine, and this is Analogicall:
which was the Ground of all the Fathers former Speeches, concerning a Bodily Vnion with Christs Body in every De∣gree. First then the Fathers, in their Symbolicall language, have called Bread the Body of Christ, onely Sacramentally; because it is a Sacrament and Signe of Christs Body; which was the Conclusion of our Second Booke. II. They have not spared to call the Change of Bread into our Bodies, a Change of Christs Body into ours, in a like Sacramentall signification, as hath beene shewed in the Third Booke. III. Vpon the same Sacramentall and Analogicall reason, they have used to say, that wee See, Touch, Tast, and Eat Christs Body, albeit Improperly, as hath beene plentifully declared, and con∣fessed in this Fift Booke. IV. (Because Eating produceth a Nourishing and Augmentation of the Body of the Eater, by the thing Eaten,) they have attributed like Phrases of our Bodily Nourishment and Augmentation by Christs Body; which you your selves have confessed to be most Improperly spoken; in the same Booke. V. Almost all the former Vnions Corpo∣rall of our Bodies with Christ, have beene ascribed by the same Fathers unto the Sacrament of Baptisme; wherein there cannot Properly be any Corporall Touch, or Conjunction at all. As for example, in saying; I. That Wee, in Baptisme, hold the feet of Christ. II. Are Sprinkled with his Blood. III. Do Eat his flesh, have Vnion with him in Nature and not onely on Affection. IV. Being made Bone of his Bone, and Flesh of his Flesh. V. Thereby have a Pledge of our Resur∣rection to Life: And a Pledge (as you have now heard) is of that, which is Absent. Each one of these, and many other the like, are abundantly alleged in the Eighth Booke of this Treatise of the Masse. The summe of all these Premises is, that wee are to acknowledge in the Objected Testimonies of Fathers, concerning the Symbol and Sacrament of Christs Body, their Symbolicall and Sacramentall, that is, Figurative Meanings. And lest you may Doubt of the reason hereof, we adjoyne the Section following.
The Divine Contemplations, which the Holy Fathers had, in uttering their Phrases of our Naturall and Corporall Conjunction with Christs Body, and Nou∣rishment thereby to Immortality; for the Elevating of our minds to a Spirituall apprehension of his Body and Blood. SECT. V. YOur Jesuites, Bellarmine, Tolet, Suarez, and Vasquez, have already instructed you, not to take such Sayings of the Fathers as they are uttered, lest the Fathers might be held to be Absurd in themselves, or Derogatory to the Dig∣nity and Majesty of this Sacrament. And they say well. But it had beene better if they had furthermore unfolded unto us the Fathers true Mysticall meaning therein; which wee must endeavour to do out of the premised Sentences of the same Fathers; to the end that you, and wee, may make an holy and comfortable use of their Divine meditations upon this Sacrament. They have sayd, I. That Christ hath a Na∣turall Vnion by his Godhead with God the Father. II. That this Godhead of Christ, by his Incarnation, is united Hyposta∣tically into our Nature of Manhood in him; whereby wee have with Christ our Naturall and Corporall Conjunction. III. That by the same Hypostaticall Vnion of his Divine and Humane Nature together, his Bodily Flesh is become the Flesh of God, his Blood the Blood of God. IV. That these being the Flesh and Blood of God, are become thereby to be Vivificall, that is, giving Life, Blisse, and Immortality, both to the Bodies and Soules of the Faithfull in Christ. V. That the Faith∣full, by Reason of the Specificall Vnion of their Humane na∣ture, with the Humane Nature of Christ, are made par∣takers the reby of his Divine Nature, and of all the In∣finite Vivification and power of grace, in this world; and of Glory and Immortality, in the world to come, wrought by his Death and Passion. VI. Both by Baptisme, and by the Eucharist, wee have a Naturall and Corporall Vnion with the Body of Christ, mystically; in as much as the Sacra∣ment of Bread and Wine (the Choycest Refections of mans Bodily Life) are Touched, Tasted, Eaten, and Sensually mixed with our Flesh to the nourishing and augmenting the same, untill it become of the Essence of our Bodily Substance un∣separably. Therfore hath this Sacrament most aptly beene called a Pledge of an unspeakable Vnion of Christs Body with ours unto Immortality, and an Earnest of our Resurrection.
Lastly, from this Sacrament there resulteth a Spirituall Vnion, continuing in the Faithfull after the Receiving of this Sacrament, even all their life long; and notwithstanding called by the same Fathers Corporall and Naturall, that is, (as they interpret themselves) from the Nature of Faith, by believing that Christ had truly a Naturall and Bodily flesh, the same Specifically with ours: Which Vnion, your Jesuites have beene enforced to acknowledge, to be in it selfe not Properly a Corporall and Naturall Vnion, but Spirituall and Mysticall, wrought onely in the Soule. But how? This in∣deed is worthy our knowledge, as a matter full of Christian Comfort. Thus then: The Disposition of the Body, in Christian Philosophy, followeth the Disposition of the Soule: For when the Soules of the Faithfull, departing this life in the state of Grace, and the Soules likewise of the Vngodly passing but from hence into the thraldome of Sin, shall resume their owne Bodies; by virtue of that Resump∣tion, shall be made possessors of Life and Blisse both in Bo∣dy and Soule; and the Wicked (contrarily) of Curse and Damnation in both, according to that Generall Doome, Come you Blessed, unto the one, &c. and Goe you Cursed, to the other, &c. Nor will your learned Suarez deny this.Suarez in 3. Tho. qu 79. Disp 64. §. 2. Gloria corpo∣ris respondet gloriae animae, sicut beati∣tudo animae respon∣det gratiae & chari∣tati: ut sicut hoc Sa∣cramentum, ne{que} ha∣bet, nequè haberé potest aliam efficaci∣am circa gloriam a∣nimae, praeter eam quam habet circa gratiam & charita∣tem, ita{que} ne{que} aliter pest efficere glo∣riam corporis, quam gloriam animae (Cō∣dudit;) Hoc Sacra∣mentum non aliam conferre vitam & immortalitatem cor∣poris, quam nutrien∣do & conservando charitatem & gra∣tiam. The Glory of the Body (saith hee) dependeth upon the Glory of the Soule, and the Happinesse of the Soule dependeth upon Grace therein; neither doth the Sacrament any otherwise conferre Immortality to the Body, but by nourishing and preserving grace in the Soule. Which is Divinely spoken. And yet wee have a more An∣cient than your Jesuite, even Cyprian, one of the Ancientest of the Primitive Fathers, whose words may serve us for a Comment upon the former objected Sayings of other Fa∣thers. Hee, in his Discourse of the Supper of the Lord, the Blessed Sacrament of our Vnion, which the Faithfull Com∣municants have in receiving it;Cyprian de Cna Dom. Potus & Esus ad eandem per∣tinent rationem, qui∣bus sicut corporea nutritur substantia, & vivit, & colum  perseerat; ita vita spiritus hoc propio alimento nutritur: & quod est esa , hoc animae est fides; quod cibus corpori est verbum spiritui, excellentiori virtute peragens aeternali∣ter, quod agant ali∣menta carnalia tem∣poraliter. As by meat and drinke (saith hee) the Substance of our Bodies is nourished and liveth, in health; so the life of the Spirit is nourished with this Ali∣ment. For what Meat is to the Flesh, that is Faith to the Soule: and what Food is to the Body, that the Word is to the Spirit working by a more excellent power for Eternity, than can our Carnall Nutriments for our Temporall life and Being. So hee. Nothing now remaineth but the last exercise of Faith, which is by Application in Speciall, taught by our Saviour, in saying to his Disciples, [Take ye, Eat, this is my Body, given for you, and This is my Blood of the New Testament shed for you.] Hereby (although it be spoken, as hath beene proved, Sacramentally and Figuratively) to instruct every of his
Disciples in taking thereof, to apply those words [Body gi∣ven for you, &c.] as verily spoken to himselfe, as if hee had sayd, Take thou Iohn, and Take thou Peter, My Body given for thee Iohn, and for thee Peter, &c. in a Sacramentall Ana∣logie. So then as my Bodily hand taketh the Sacramentall Bread, the Signe of Christs Body; and my Bodily mouth eateth, and my Bodily stomacke digesteth, and turneth it, as nourishment, into my flesh; so my Soule saith that I be∣lieve that the Body of my Saviour was Crucifyed, and his Blood shed for mee, whole man, Body and Soule: And that thereby I have an Interest in the power of his Passion, both for Redemption, and for Everlasting Salvation; whereof I have a Sacramentall Pledge, by the converting of Bread into the Substance of mine owne Flesh: According to the Consonant Doctrine of Antiquity, set downe in the last Chapter of this Fift Booke. {fleur-de-lys} CHAP. X. Of the Romish Historicall Objections Chiefely insisted upon, out of Iustine, concerning the Slander raysed against Christians of Eating mans flesh, sprung (as is pretended) from the Catholike Do∣ctrine of Eating Christs Body in the Eucharist; which is their First Argument. SECT. I. MAny leaves are spent by M.Mr. Brerely in his Liturgie Tra. 2. §. 2. Subd 4. p. 121. Where in his Mar∣gin hee citeth Vadi∣an, whom hee na∣meth a Zuinglian: [And if so, how fare hee was from confes∣sing a Corporall Pre∣sence, the Romish Authors, who con∣demne him for the contrary opinion, doe prove.] See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 3. Brerely in pressing this Objection; the strength of his Inforcement standeth thus: Iustine Martyr, in the yeare 130. writing an Apologie to the Heathen Emperour, when he was in discourse of the Eucharist (The reported Doctrine whereof, concerning the Reall Presence, was the true and confessed Cause of this Slander;) and when hee should have removed the suspicion thereof, did not∣withstanding call the Eucharist, No common Bread, but, after Consecration, the food wherewith our Flesh and Blood is fed, &c. Then hee proceedeth in urging his other Argument (as follow∣eth) borrowed from theBellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 4. Cardinall, to wit, Iustine his comparing the Change in the Eucharist to be a worke of Om∣nipotencie,
and for his not expounding the words of Christ Figuratively. Then is brought inIn the Mar∣gin of Master Berely. Ibid. Attalas the Martyr, whilest he was under the Tortures, and Torments of his Perse∣cutors, saying, Behold your Doing, [Hoc est homines devorare] This is a Devouring of men: wee Christians do not Devoure men. To whom is joyned Tertullian, making mention of the same Clamour of Sacrifising a Childe, and Eating his flesh, [Ad no∣strae Doctrinae notam:] To the infamie of our Profession. At length Master Brerely concludeth as followeth; So evidently doth this Slander, thus given forth by the Iewes, argue sufficiently the Doctrine of Reall presence, and Sacrifice: and for as much as the Slander went so generally of all Christians, it is probable that it did not arise from any sort of one or other Christian in particular. So hee. {fleur-de-lys} And so, long before him, Doctor Heskins; Hekins in his Parliament, B. 2. Cap. 42. fol. 156. This fame among the Infidels being grounded upon the same faith of Christians, proveth the Presence. Meaning the Corporall Presence and Existence of Christs Body in the Eucharist. That the Romish Objection is, in it selfe, most Slanderous against the Historicall Truth taught by the Ancient Fathers; and Confessed by the Romish Doctors themselves. SECT. II. VVHat? That the Catholike Doctrine of Ancient times, concerning our Eating of Christ's Body in this Sacrament, should have beene the Cause; yea, or yet the Occasion to the Heathen and Iewes, of imputing to the Christians a Capernaiticall Eating of Man's flesh? This is the first Argument, which your Objectors, from Historicall Rela∣tions, use for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, out of this Ancient Father Iustine Martyr; In Confutation whereof wee produce (see the Margin) the Testimonies of these Ancient FathersAug.

Baronius, and 9Lorinus, men of chiefest note in your Church; witnessing concerning that lowd and lewd Slander cast upon Catholike Christi∣ans, by both Iewes and Gentiles, that it was occasioned by Hereticall, and Fanaticall Christians, in the Primitive Age of the Church; such as were the Montanists, the Cataphryges and Gnosticks, who did indeed and Really eate Humane flesh. So they. But most especially is this Romish Figment confuted by the Storie it selfe, which by the Relation of the foresaid Fathers, Confessions of the former Romanists, and Tenor of the Histories themselves, was, The Eating of a Child or Infant; which maketh the falshood of your Objections to seeme, in a maner palpable unto us; because Christ being crucified by both Jewes and Gentiles, when hee was above thirty yeares of Age, and the whole Church of Christ pro∣fessing as much, it was not possible that the Eating of an In∣fant onely, should produce an opinion of Eating a Man of growth; much lesse could it be credible, that they imputed the Eating thereof in the Eucharist, if (as your French Gabriel Episcop. Albispin. lib. 1. Observat. 18: Eucharistia non nisi mane sumebatur. Tet. ad uxor. Non sciet Maritus quid secreto ante cibum gustes. Agapae non nisi vespere.

Imper. Iustin. Gretzerus. Ies. de cruce, lib. 1. cap. 51. Ethnici aliqui mentiebantur Christianos A sinum pro Deo colete. Bi∣shop teacheth) This their Eating the flesh of a Child, was not practised in the Feast of the Lord's Supper, but at their Love-Feasts, called Agapae. So hee. And consequently so sandie and boggie is this foundation of your maine Objection, for proofe of the Corporall Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The Second Romish Argument out of Justine, termed Insoluble before all others, is, because when hee called the Eating of the Eucharist, the Eating of the Body of Christ, hee wrot to an Heathen Emperour. SECT. III. IVstine writeth an Apologie unto Antoninus Pius, an Heathen Emperour, at what time the Slander of Eating Humane
flesh fell upon the Orthodoxe Christians, Originally from the impious Practice of Hereticall Christians, as you have heard; and now are you to heare the Insoluble Argument forsooth, which your Cardinall Bellarmine extracteth from thence.Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 4. Inso∣lubie manet hoc Dilemma; Aut po∣terat Iustinus vere dicere, carnem Chri∣sti a Christianis so∣lum in signo mandu∣cari; aut non pote∣rat; si poterat, Pae∣varicator fuit causae Christianae: Nam odiosissimam reddi∣dit fidem, & auxit criminum supicio∣nem, cum posset unto verbo, & fidem pro∣babilem facere, & cri∣men diluere: Si non poterat, certè id eo non poterat, quia verè, & non in signo tantum datur nobis comedenda Christi caro. This Dilemma (saith hee) remaineth Insoluble. Either could Iustine truly have sayd, that the flesh of Christ is Eaten of Christians onely in a Signe: or hee could not have so sayd. If hee could, then did hee play the Praevaricator in be∣traying the Christian cause, by making the Christian Profession most odious, to the increasing of the suspicion; when as in one word hee might have made it probable, and so have blotted out the Infamy conceived against Christians. And if hee could not say that Christ is Eaten in the Eucharist, onely as in a Signe; doubtlesse the reason why hee could not, must have beene because the flesh of Christ is not given to be Eaten therein as in a Signe onely. So he, Ostentatively of his owne Argument, insigned by himselfe Insoluble, as you see; Notwithstanding this may admit divers and sundry Solutions. That the Hornes of your Cardinals Dilemma are easily blunted by a Three-fold Solution. The Firs is by shewing the Cause to be Impertinent. SECT. IV. IVstineIustin. A∣polog. 2. Refert prae∣scriptum Antonini Imperatoris, ad po∣pulos A siae. Senten∣tiam corum (Chri∣stianorum) veuti im∣piorum & nullorum Deorum sugillatis et alia quaedam obi∣citis crimina, quae non potestis probate. shewed to the same Emperour, that no Im∣piety at all (upon any Inquisition formerly made) could be layd to the charge of Orthodoxe Christians, in this Case, by good proofes. First Iustine propoundeth the Let∣ters of the Emperour Adrian, Father to Antoninus, who, upon experience of the extreme malice of his Heathen peo∣ple against Christians, required, that his Officers should not prosecute against any Christian without proofe of some Impiety. As also the Epistle of Marcus, Emperour before his Father, who became both a Patron to justifie the Case of Christi∣ans, in respect of such Crimes objected against them; and a Protector of their Persons; commanding that whosoever should accuse a Christian. Onely for being a Christian (that is for his Profession sake onely) should be burnt Quicke. And should not the Sacrifising of Infants (if any such had beene practised by the Christians) have beene held Capitall Crimes with those Emperours, trow yee? Besides this Iustine allegeth unto this Emperour Antoninus himselfe, his
owne Epistle, whereby he testifyed in the Behalfe of Chri∣stians, . that None of those Crimes and Impieties, whereof they were accused, could be proved against them; which pro∣veth, that notwithstanding all the Inquisition that Malice it selfe could make into the Mysteries of Christians, concer∣ning the Eucharist, either in Word, or in Act, was not held offensive unto those Emperors, upon any Information, made by their Adversaries, against them. The Second Solution, to prove their Dilemma Insufficient. SECT. V. OVr next Reason of the Insufficiencie meeteth with the Cardinalls Reason, enforced by the First Horne of his Dilemma, thus:See above, Sect. 3. If Iustine (saith hee) could have sayd that Christs flesh is eaten in the Eucharist, onely in a Signe; then did hee praevaricate in the Case of Christians, and make their faith most odious, in increasing the Suspicion of the Crime objected against them. Wee Answer, that although hee might have sayd, that Christs flesh is eaten Bodily, onely in a Signe, yet was not this necessary for the freeing of the Christian Faith from that Suspicion of Eating a Child. One Reason may be, Because nothing was more familiar, even unto the Heathen themselves, than to use the like language, in calling their Sacramentall and Mysticall, Signes, by the names of the Things signifyed thereby, whereof you have heard a Me∣morable example out ofSee above, Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 2. Homer; where, even as Christ sayd of Consecrated Bread, [This is my Body;] So those Heathen, in Sacrifising of Lambes, for Ratification of their Oaths and Covenants, called those Sacrifices their Oaths. And that nothing was more familiar among the Heathen, you may know by that Proverbiall speech; Sine Cerere & Libero friget Venus: without Ceres and Bacchus Lust doth lan∣guish: where they give to Bread the name of the Goddesse Ceres, and the name of God Bacchus to Wine. Secondly, and more especially may this appeare out of Iustine, immediatly after the place now objected, thus: Iustin. Loco supracitat [Hoc est sanguis meus] . Christ (saith Iustine) receiving Bread, saith [This is my Body:] and taking the Cup, sayd [This is my Blood:] and delivered them onely in those words; the which also even the wicked Devils, by Imitation, have taught to be done in the My∣steries of their Mithra, (namely) for that Bread and a Pot of Water is put in the Sacrifices of him that is initiated unto their Communion, in the Sacrifices, by Addition of certaine words, as you either know, or might have knowne. So Iustine,
To the Heathen Emperour. Do you not see how the Devils in their Sacrifices and Mysteries (asTertul. de Corna ) Ag∣noseamus ingenia  ideuco quae∣dam de divims asse∣ctantis, ut nos de su∣oru fide confundat, et udcet. Idem. de Praesription. Ipsus res Sacramentorum. devinorum in Idol ∣rum mysters aemu∣latur. Tigit & ipse quosdam,—ce∣lebrat et panis obla∣tionem; et imagi∣nem Resurrectionis inducit. Tertullian witnesseth) affect Divine Rites; And by Imitation play Christs Apes, as other Fathers use to speake; And that not onely in their Materiall Ceremonies, such as are Bread and Cup, but also in their Verball, by Addition of words, as Iustine sheweth. Where you may perceive how Iustine argued with those Heathen out of their owne Mysteries, and (that wee may so call them) Sacraments: even as Saint Paul did with the Athe∣nians out of the Inscription of their owne Altar. It happened not above a quarter of a yeare, after that had set downe this Observation, that in reading a Booke of that never too worthily Commended Mirrour of Learning, Master Isaac Casaubone, I found this my Opinion fortifyed, and as it were animated with his most acurate Judgement, shewing out of his most exquisite Reading; thatIsaac Ca∣saub in  exer∣citat. 16. Iustinus in Apologia altera nar∣rat, malos Daemo∣nas in Mithae my∣sterijs S. Eacharliae aemulationem quan∣dam tradidisse. . Ecce panem et poculum; sed a∣quae, ut dixi, non vin  verba so∣lemnia super Symbo∣lis proferri solita: id enim significat isto in loco vox . qd. super dicta: qua voce utuntur Iuris. consulti. Etiam Ar∣rianus, loco paulo ante indicato, sacras mysteriorum voces commemorat, quas magnà cum reveren∣tiâ excipi solitas ostendit: , ,   cum Eucharistia et sit et dcatur Communio, sicut ante est expositum: indem Mithr mysterijs Communio quae est omnibus animanti∣bus inter se, miro Symbolorum genere expribaur. The Devils did, in aemulation of Christians, use in their Mysteries of Mythra, Symbols of Bread and Cup, adding solemne Mysti∣call words. Hee furthermore sheweth out of Porphyrie, that in their Religious Communion, they had certaine Aenigma∣ticall expressions; Calling their Communicants, if Men, Lions; if Women, Hyenas; and if Ministers, Crowes. Still (as you see) using Mysticall and Figurative Appellations in their Ceremoniall Rites. Vpon which evidence wee may easily encounter your Cardinalls Dilemma with this that followeth. Either the Emperour and the Heathen people did perceive that the words of Christ, now published by Iustine, were spoken Figuratively, signifying the Outward Eating of his Body, Bodily, in a Signe onely; or they did not. If they did know so much, then could they not be offended with Orthodoxe Christians, or Scandalized thereby. And if they did not know that they were Figuratively and Mysti∣cally to be understood, then would not those Emperours have absolved Christians from all blame (as you see they did) but punished them for Sacrificing of Infants; which Act, among these Heathen, was held to be Criminall and Capitall. And that Iustine did not Praevaricate by concea∣ling his Figurative sense of Christs words, it is as manifest by that he Instructed them therein out of their own Phrases, used in their Ceremonies of their God Mithra.
The Impossibility that any Heathen could be offended at the former words of Justine. SECT. VI. NO Heathen, that heard of the Catholike Faith of Chri∣stians, concerning the Body of Christ, in those Primi∣tive times, published by Ancient Fathers, and by Iustine himselfe, could, except it were against their Consciences, impute unto Christians a Corporall Eating of the Body of Christ. For, first, the Articles of Christian Faith (for which so many Armies of Martyrs conquered the Infidelity of the world, by Martyrdome) being this; that Christ, the Saviour of the world, God and Man, ascended into Heaven, and there now reigneth in the Kingdome of everlasting Blessednesse, adored of all Christians with Divine worship. Another Ar∣ticle, Vniversally held of those Catholike Fathers (as hath beenSee Book 4. c. 5. §. 5. proved) that the Body of Christ was ever, notwith∣standing his Resurrection and Ascension, Circumscribed in one place. And thirdly, All knowing that this Principle was universally and infallibly believed of all the Heathen (namely) To thinke it Impossible for one Body to be in many places at once. Therefore was it Impossible for the Heathen to conceive that the Christians taught a Corporall Eating of that Body on Earth, which they believed was Circumscribed, and conteined in Heaven. Fourthly, That this was the Faith, which the same Ancient Father Iustine did professe and pub∣lish at that time, is now to be tryed out of the Bookes of Iu∣stine himselfe. That Iustine himselfe did accordingly argue against the Possibi∣lity of Christs Bodily Presence on Earth; And that Attalas (objected) condemneth the Romish Capernaiticall Swallowing of Christs Body. SECT. VII. IVstine, in the same Apologie, now objected, and by him di∣rected unto the Heathen Emperor Antoninus sirnamed the Godly, before his words of Eating Christs flesh, setteth down the Christian Article of his Ascension into Heaven, saying Iustin. in Apo∣logia secund pag. 64. Deus, Christum post Resurrectionem illa∣turus coelo , &c. adver∣santes Daemones per∣cutiat, et bonorum numerum expleatur, propter quos non∣dum extremum De∣cretum et consum∣mationem fecit. that God the Father assumed Christ, after his death, into Heaven, there , that is, To detaine him, untill hee van∣quished the Devils, and filled up the number of the Godly. An
Argument (as Athanasius, and Augustine observeth) which was used by Christ himselfe, as that which ought to have perswaded the very Capernaites, that Christ was not to be Bodily Eaten upon Earth (as hath beeneSee above, B. 5. cap. 3. Sect. 2. proved.) The same Iustine in his Resolution of Questions, made by Ortho∣doxe Christians, shewed that Christ denyed to have a Con∣tinuall Conversation with men, after his Resurrection, which hee had before his Passion: Namely thatIustin. Quaest. & Resp. ad Orthodo∣x. pag. 327. . adding that after his Resurection . Hee would by little and little disuse and unaccustome them with his sight and , that is, Presence. Do you heare his with∣drawing his Presence? That is, will you say, his Visible Pre∣sence. Nay, but whatsomever Locall Presence, which hee had among them formerly; whether (saith Iustine) of Being Seene, or of Not being Seene among them. This is plaine. Of Averroes his Imputing to Christians the Devouring of their God. SECT. VIII. WEe are not ignorant what some of you would Reply, by Instancing in Averroes his upbrayding of Chri∣stians with Devouring of their God, which wee may justly conceive hee spake in the spirit of Malignancie, and against his owne knowledge, as the Premises have proved, and against the expresse Profession of Ancient Fathers, detesting the same Conceipt of Devouring Christs flesh (as you have formerly heard.) Just like as our Romish Adversaries deale with us, who, as often as they labour to confute our Doctrine of Iustification onely by Faith, do inveigh against Protestants, as professing a Iustifying Faith without Good works and Repen∣tance. And notwithstanding the same Objectors themselves, expressing the very words of Protestants, confesse that their Iustifying Faith, which they teach, is a Living Faith al∣wayes joyned with Contrition of heart for sinne, and purpose of Amendment of Life, and that this Iustification by Faith can be no more separated from Sanctification of Life, than can the Light in the Fire from the Heart thereof. How be it the Observation of some other is very proba∣ble; to wit, that Averragës understanding of the Decree of Pope Nicolas (abovePope Nico∣las the Second, living Ann. 1059. Averroes (ut at Possevinus Biblioth lib 13. c. 23.) fuit à Nativitate Christi, anno 1150. discussed) in his Romane Synod, and imposed upon the Faith of all Christians within his Romish Jurisdiction, teaching them to believe, that The Body of Christ is sensually Eaten and Torne with the Teeth of all the Commu∣nicants of this Sacrament: Which tenour of Speech hath
beene abandoned by your owne Doctors; some censuring it as harsh and false, and some as Hereticall. It can be no mar∣vaile (say wee) that Averros hearing of this, Then professed by Papall Christians, did deride and detest all such Eaters of their God, and that most Justly. Because that Devouring (as hath beene confessed by your Jesuite) is nothing else but a Transmitting without mastication, or Tearing, into the stomack▪ else could not Scriputre have sayd, that Ionas was devoured of the Whale. Which your Corporall Swallowing of Christs Body, if it had beene held Christian in the Dayes of Anti∣quity, then could not Attalas (as hath beene objected) have upbraided the Heathenish Persecutors at the time of his Martyrdome, saying,See above Sect. 1. This (your persecuting of Christi∣ans to death) is a Devouring of men, Wee Christians do not Devoure men. Such is the Vnluckinesse of your Objectors to urge most vehemently and eagerly, still, that which ma∣keth most against them. And indeed the Romish must needs be sayd to Devoure that which they professe to Eat, Swallow, and sometime to passe into their Bellies, and after into the Draught. CHAP. XI. Of the Fift, Last, and Basest Romish maner of Vnion with Christs Body, in the Infe∣riour parts of your Com∣municants. HItherto have your Romish Disputers laboured to bring the Body of Christ into your Bellies and Entrailes: Now, as if they thought this not a sufficient Vilfication of the Blessed Bo∣die of Christ, they proceede to depresse it lower, into the Basest place of Baseness, which is the Draught and Seege it selfe: so vile, that the very Inke may seeme to blush, in setting downe the Sordi∣dity thereof; which (in respect of other Readers, than your selves, who teach this) wee may not further adventure to mention without Preface of Reverence; under our Readers patience therefore wee proceed, as followeth.
Shewing the Romish Doctrine of an Vnion of Christs Body with the Basest parts of Mans Body, to be more Beastly than the Carnall and Capernaiticall conceipt of Eating Christs Body is read of ever to have descended unto. SECT I. CApernaites, when they were offended at Christs words, concerning the receiving of Christs flesh, are not read to have proceeded further in the grosenesse of their Imagination, than to a Proper Eating thereof. Our Saviour shewing the Ordinary Course of meat, in the superfluity thereof, above that which is turned into nourishment, and changed in the Substantiall parts of mans Body, saith that Coming into the Belly, it descendeth into the Draught. A Saying which holdeth true, as well in meat Sacramentall, as Naturall; as Manna, for example (called Angels food) and the Paschall Lambe, neither of both were privileged from the ordinary course of Nature. And as for the materiall part of this Sa∣crament, Origen saith as much of it, thatOrigen. See B. 4. cap. 9. § 3. & B. 3. cap. 3. § 1. & B. 5. cap. 6. §. 3. Going into the Belly, it passeth into the Draught. But what now is your Ro∣mish Doctrine? The generall learning of your Schooles is, that The Body of Christ is under the formes of Bread whereso∣ever, so long as they remaine uncorrupt. Which is so verily your Romane Faith, that one of your Cardinalls in his Cate∣chisme, telleth his Catechumenist, thatContarenus Cardinal. Catechests Christiana. Interrog. 14. Remanetne cor∣pus Christi▪ & san∣guis, in Eucharistia, donec species illae re∣manent? Resp. Quis sanus mente posset de hoc ambigere.

This Ground being thus layd, wee propound unto you the Consequences hereof, as wee finde them divulged in print by your owne Authors, and in their privileged Books, Antoninus was (asAnton Pos∣setia. Apparat. Tit. Antoninus—Anto∣ninus Florentinus, deinceps Archiepi∣scopus Patriae suae, in Sanctorum numerum à Pontifice Clemente Septimo relatus. you know) an Arch-Bishop living, and being dead, Canonized a Saint by Pope Nicolas. Hee shall be our Relater of the Doctrine of Paludanus, whom your JesuitePossevin. Apparat. Tit. Petrus de Palude.—Inter Theologos celebris, & postea Patriarcha Constan∣tinopolitanus. commendeth for a Famous Divine, and some∣time a Patriarch. This Petrus Paludanus, from your former Generall Principle, argued, saying thatAntonini Summae, parte tertia, Tit. 13. cap. 6. §. 3. de Defectibus Missae Petrus de Pa∣lude. Non potest evomi nisi quod in stomachum est trajectum. Et quod dicit  illa Glossa, quod in se∣cessum non emittitur, sed per sudorem aliter emanat, fatuum est fingere, qui & per secessum taliter emitti pos∣sunt species, sicut emitteretur substantia panis & vin, & non aliter. Illa autem quanquam non corrupta emi∣tuntur, ut in habentibus fluxum▪ergo & species, propter quod non est danda Eucharistia habenti talem flu∣xum, quia se emittit integrum quod sumit, sicut nec habenti vomitum,  istud magis cederet in irreveren∣tiam Sacramenti, quam illud. Igitur, Corpus & Sanguis Christi, tamdiu manet in ventre, & stomacho vel vo∣mitu, & quocunque alibi, quamdiu species manet, sicut substantia conversa mansistet, & si species incorruptae evomuntur vel egrediuntur, ut ibi verè Corpus Christ. The formes of Bread and Wine do as verily goe into the Stomack, and so after
into the Draught, as could the Substance of either of them, if they were there, and yet sometimes passe out uncorrupted, in Bodies infirme, and especially those that labour of the Fluxe: Because some so diseased persons do let passe from them that which they eat, as uncorrupt as they received it, whether it be by Vomit, or by Egestion into the Seege. So hee. Which againe is a Doctrine so verily Romish, that your owne Casust, in his Booke enstiled Morall Resolutions, propoundeth two Cases; and afterwards manerly (saving your presence) resolveth them thus:Iohannes Bap∣tista de Bertis. Qu. 5. Art. 6. Dub. 5. Quid agendum sit, si post sumptionem sangui∣nis patiatur Sacerdos vomitum, vel ex in∣firmitate emittit per secessum, quod sump∣sit. Et idem Iohann. Baptista. Qu. 5. Ar∣tic. 3. Dub. 5. Quid agendum, si quis post sumptionem sangui∣nis Christi statim patiatur vomitum. Resp. Reverenter col∣ligantur species pa∣nis, si decerni pos∣sunt, & reponantur in sacrario, vel su∣mantur ab aliquo, si saltem adsit aliquis ad sumendum dispo∣situs absque nausea, & ea, in quibus in∣ventae fuerunt spe∣cies, comburantur, & cineres in Sacrario recondantur; & idem dicendum est, si ex infirmitate statim emittat per secessum. that If any, after the receiving of the Body of Christ, shall be provoked by Vomit, upward; or else by Egestion to cast them out, then, that the formes of both may be Reverently licked up, if any can per∣forme this without loathsomnesse. So hee. Might this be Possible! Wee returne to your Relater Antoninus, out of Plaudanus, giving you an example of a Devout man much commended by oneAntoni quo supra. Et siquidem homo esset tanti fervoris quod hujusmodi non horreret, sed sumeret, commendandus esset; si tamen esset jejuns. Sic Beatus Hugo. Cluniacus commendavit Goderanum sumendo partiunculas Hostiae, quas leprosus cum vi∣lissimo sputu evomuerat, dicens Cratuculam Laurentij esse tollerabiliorem. Nec puto eos sibi contrarios, sed dictum Thomae videtur intelligendum, cum jam videtur species Sacramenti alierata, scilicer, quod debet com∣buri animal. Dictum verò Petri, cum factum est ita recens, quòd adhuc creditur species Sacramenti permanere in stomacho, & tunc debet exenterari. Hugo For Licking up the Hoast vo∣mited; and after affirming that the suffering on Saint Lau∣rence his Gridiron had beene more tolerable than this. So they. How like you this? For mislike it you may not, it being the naturall Brat and Off-spring of your Generall Romish faith, Believing (as hath beene sayd) that the Body and Blood of Christ is under the Consecrated formes of Bread and of Wine wheresoever, so long as the same formes remaine uncorrupted. This Theme will not permit much Discussion, for, as the Saying is, Omne Coenum maè olet, commove, & senties odo∣rem. Wee hasten to the next Section. That the very Imagination of this Former Romish Beastly Doctrine would have beene held of the Ancient Fathers most Abominable. SECT. II. THe Holy Fathers (if they had beene of your Romish Faith, concerning the Corporall Presence of Christs Body in this Sacrament) must have held also your Romish Conclu∣sion, of a Possibility of Egestion; the Conceipt whereof they did greatly abhorre. ForCyril. Hierosol. See above, Booke 4. cap . §. . Cyril of Ierusalem, to the end that hee might abstract mens mindes from all such mon∣strously-prophane and Base thoughts and conceptions, con∣cerning
the Body of Christ, denyed peremptorily, that Christs Body can passe into the Seege. Which also seemed to be so unsavorie and loathsome toChrysost. Ibid. Chrysostome, that hee spit at the first thought thereof, with an Absit! as much as to say [Fy upon it!] in execration thereof. Some Creatures are said, for keeping Hunters from pursuing them, to cast Dung and Filth backward in their faces: and so it falleth out (in a maner) here, where the Turpitude and Beastlinesse of your Doctrine forbiddeth us to inlarge our Confutation, and therefore wee hasten to a Conclusion. That the Institution of this Sacrament was ordained to be Food onely for the Soule, and not for the Body, according to the Iudgement of Antiquitie. SECT. III. THis Proposition hath beene alreadySee above ch. 2. § 3. confessed by your Councel of Trent, and Romane Catechisme, and confirmed by the Consent ofSee above ch. 10. §. 5. Antiquity it selfe; where it was ma∣nifested, that albeit they sometime make mention of it's being Food and Life to the Body also; yet was not this (as your Jesuites haveIbid. confessed) so sayd in respect of any im∣mediate Bodily preservation therof, in this Life, but in the Everlasting Life of Glorification, in the Day of Resurrection, after it be reunited to the Soule, according to that Promise of Christ, Ioh. 6. excepting only the Analogicall and Sacra∣mentall maner of Feeding, which wee defend (that is to say) As the Body Feedeth Corporally on the Sacrament, Bread; so is the Soule nourished Spiritually with Christs Body and Blood. Otherwise the Ancient Fathers maintayned a sole Soule-feeding on Christs Body; in which respect (as one of yourCasaub. Ex. erit. 16. cap. 39. Vocant Graeci Pa∣tres hoc Sacramen∣tum . owne learned Authors hath informed you) The Greek Fathers called that which wee receive [,] that is, Supersubstantiall Bread.Tertull. de Orat. Aug.

Wee adde the particular ac∣cordant Testimonies of diverse Fathers, of whom if you aske, What the Meat is, which you must believe to Eat in this Sacrament? They will tell you, Not of the Body, but of the Soule. If Who must be the Eater? Not the outward, but the Inward man. If What it is that hungreth for this? The Inward Soule. If What must taste it? The Soule. If with What mouth? That, whereof Tertullian said (speaking of Christs Flesh) It is to be devoured with the Eare, ruminated with the Minde, and disgested with Faith. If How? Let Saint Augustine make up the whole harmony; Eat his Flesh▪
See above ch. 6. §. 4. This (saith hee) is a Figurative Speech, commanding us to communicate of his Passion; and sweetly and profitably close up in our memories, that his Flesh was wounded and crucifyed for us. So the Fathers. Besides many other like Sayings, by us already related in the former Sections, wherein hath beene opposed out of the Fathers, against your Corporall Touch, saying of Christ, Touch mee not: against your Orall Eating thus, Not meat of the Tooth; but of the Minde: against your Swallowing thus, Wee Devour not Christs Flesh: against your Corporall mixture therewith thus, Wee mingle not the Persons and Substances: And against your Corporall Transmitting the same Body downe by Egestion thus, It de∣scendeth not into the Draught. Wee therefore (according to the genuine sense of Pri∣mitive Fathers, answerable to the Doctrine of Christ) con∣clude; that such as is our Feeding of Christs Body in this Sacrament, such also must be our Eating, because Eating is ordained for Feeding. But by the universall Consent of all Christian Professours, of all ages, whether Primitive, or Successive, Greeke or Romane, Protestants or Papists; our Spirituall Feeding of Christ Body, in this Sacrament, is de∣voyd of all Corporall Instrument, or effect. Therefore our Spirituall Eating is no way Corporall. {fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. THrice therefore, yea foure times unconscionable are your Disputers, in Objecting the former Sentences of holy Fathers, as teaching a Corporall and Naturall Vnion of Christs Body with the Bodies of the Communicants; once, because they, in true sense, make not at all for your Romish Tenet: next, be∣cause they make against it: then, because the Corporall Con∣junction, though it be of the Body of Christ, and Bodies of Chri∣stians, in respect of the Object, yet for the Matter and Sub∣ject, it is of Sacramentall Bread united with our owne Bodies, in a Mysticall Relation to the Body of our Redeemer; and lastly, and that principally, because they meant a Spirituall Conjunction properly, and perpetually belonging to the San∣ctifyed Communicants, and herein consonant to the profession of Protestants. Wherefore Primitive and Holy Fathers would have stood amazed, and could not have heard without horrour of your Corporall Conjunction of Christ his Body in Boxes and Dunghills, in Mawes of Beasts, in Guts of Mice, Wormes and Dogs, and at length into the Seege, as you have taught. Fie, Fie Tell it not in Gath, nor let it be once heard of in any Heathenish Nation, to the Blaspheming of the
Christian profession, and Dishonouring of the Broad Seale of the Gospel of Christ, which is the Blessed Sacrament of his pre∣cious Body and Blood. {fleur-de-lys} Thus much of the Romish Consequence, from their Proper and Literall sense of Christs words [This is my Body] so farre as concerneth Corporall Vnion. The next Conse∣quence will be touching the Proper Sacrificing thereof; whereunto wee proceed, nothing doubting but that wee shall finde your Romish Disputers the same men, which hitherto they have appeared to be; Peremptory in their Assertions, Vnconscionable in their Inforcements of the Sentences of Antiquity, Contradictory to them∣selves; and Vaine and Absurd in their Inferences and Con∣clusions. {fleur-de-lys}
THE SIXTH BOOKE, Entreating of the fourth Romish Consequence, which concerneth the pretended proper Propitiatorie Sa∣crifice in the Romish Masse, arising from the depraved Sense of the former words of Christ; [THIS IS MY BODY:] and confuted by the true Sense of the words following, [IN REMEMBRANCE OF MEE.] The State of the Controversie. WHo soever shall deny it (say your Fathers ofSi quie dixerit. non offerri Deo ve∣rum & proprium Sa∣crificium, aut non est Propitiatorium, Aa∣thema sit. cone. Tri Sess. 22. Cap. 1. & 3. Vi∣sibile. cap. 1. Sacramen∣tum verè propitiatori∣um. cap. 2. Trent) to bee a true and proper Sa∣crifice, or that it is Propitiatory: Let him bee Anatherna, or Accisrsed. Which one Canon hath begot two Contro∣versies (as youPrima Controver∣sia est,  Missa ve∣rè & propriè dictum Sacrificium. Seund, sit nè Propitiatorium. Bellar. Praf Tract. de Missa. know.) One, Whe∣ther the Sacrifice in the Masse be a pro∣per Sacrifice. 2. Whether it bee truly Propitiatory Your Trent-Synode hath affirmed both; Protestants deny both; so that, Proper, and Improper, are the distinct Borders of both Controversies. And now whether the Affirmers or Deni∣ers, that is, the Cursers, or the parties so Cursed deserve rather the Curse of God, wee are forthwith to examine. Wee begin with the Sacrifice, as it is called Proper. This Examination hath foure Trials: 1. By the Scripture. 2. By the Judgement of Ancient Fathers. 3. By Romish Principles; and 4. By Comparison betweene this your Masse, and the Protestants Sacrifice, in the Celebration of the holy Eucharist.
CHAP. I. Our Examination by Scripture. SCriptures alleaged by our Disputers, for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice, are partly out of the new Testa∣ment, and partly out of the old. In the new, some Objections are collected out of the Gospell of Christ, and some out of other places. We begin∣ning at the Gospell, assuredly affirme that if there were in it any note of a Proper Sacrifice, it must necessarily appeare either from some speciall word, or else from some Sacrificing Act of Christ, at his first Institution. First of Christs words. That there is no one word, in Christ his first Institution, which can probably inferre a Proper Sacrifice; not the first and principall words of Luc. 22. [Hoc FACITE: DOE THIS.] SECT. I. WHen wee call upon you for a Proofe, by the words of Christ, we exact not the very word Offering, or Sacrifice, in the same Syllables, but shall bee content with any Phrase of equivalencie, amounting to the sense or meaning of a Sacrifice. In the first place you object those words of Christ, [Hoc facite: Doe this.] from which your Councell of[Hoc facite] Tunc, utà Sancto Sy∣nodo definitum est, Christus Sacerdotes instituit, praecepirgue ut & ipsi & qui  eis essent, corpus ejus immolarent. Ca∣techis. Trid. de Euch. Num. 58. Trent hath collected the Sacrificing of the Body of Christ: which your Cardinall avouch∣eth with hisCerium est, pro∣bari Sacrificium Mis∣sae his verbis, [Hoc fa∣cite] &c. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12. Certum est, as a truth without all exception; as if [Doe this] in the literall sense, were all one with [Doe you Sacri∣fice,] But why? because, forsooth, the same word in the Hebrew Originall, and in the Greeke Translation is elsewhere so used, Levit. 15. for Doe, nor Make, spoken of the Turtle-dove prepared for an Holocaust, or Sacrifice: and 1 King. 18. 23. where Elias (speaking of the Priests of Baal, and telling them that he meant to have a Sacrifice,) said, Doe, or Make. So he, together with some other Iesuites. But vainly, ridiculously, and injuriously. I. Vainly, because the word, Doe, in those Scriptures did not simply in it selfe import a Sacrifice, but only consequently (to wit) by reason of the matter subject then spoken of, which was a matter of Sacrifice: and are so explained by just circumstances, as may appeare in the places objected, Lev. 15. where was speech of a Turtle-dove, appointed for a Sacrifice. And so likewise in 1 King. 18. 23. was there mention of a Bullocke to be ordained for a Sacrifice. Whosoever, having spoken of his Riding, shall com∣mand one servant, saying, Make ready: and after, being an hungry,
and having spoken of meat, shall command another, saying like∣wise, Make ready, None can be so simple as to confound the dif∣ferent senses of the same word Make, but knoweth right well that the Significations are to be distinguished by the different subjects of speech; the first relating to his horse, and the other to his meat, and the like, wherein the different Circumstances doe diversifie the sense of the same word. II. Ridiculously. For if the Hebrew and GreekeGnaschah, Heb. the same in Greeke, , in Latine, Fa∣cio Iud. 6 29. Ios. 5. vers. ull. Iob. 13. 7. , and Marc. 11. 3. Si quis dixerit,  Editions, which signifie Doe this, doe necessarily argue a sacrificing act or Sacrifice, then shall you be compelled to admit of strange and odde kinds of Sacrifices; one in Gideon his destroying of the Altar of Baal: another in Moses his Putting off his shooes. A third in Christs washing his Disciples feet. A fourth (to goe no further) in the Mans Loosing of his Colt. In all which Instances there are the same originall words now objected, by interpretation, Doe, or Make. Even as it was also in Christs words to Iudas, then, when that Monster was plotting that heinous Treason, saying. [] That which thou doest, doe quickly. Can your Alchymists possibly extract a dramme of Sacrifice, as offered by Iudas, either from the word, Doe, or Doest, in that place? III. Injuriously. First, to the Text of Christ, wherein the word is not indefinite, Doe, but determinate, [Doe this.] Next, Injurious to your owne many Authors: for the words, [Doe this] (by theSee above Book. . Chap. 2. §. 1. confessions of your owne Iesuites and others) have re∣ference to all the former Acts of Christ his Celebration, then specified; as namely, Blessing, Breaking, Eating, &c. Yea, and if your Cardinals Answer were held so Certaine among your selves, then would not your Iesuite Maldonate have so farre slighted it, as to say,Maldon. Non quòd contendam illud ver∣bum [Facite] illo lo∣co significare idem quod sacrificare. Lib. 7 de Sacra. Tom. 1. part. 3. de Eucharist. I will not contend, that in this place the word [Doe] signifi∣eth the same with, Doe sacrifice. {fleur-de-lys} If you thinke this be not oppo∣site enough, then behold your Iesuite Estius flatly contending against it.Estius Ies Com in 1 Cor. 11 vers. 24. Non quòd verbū [Facere] sit idem quod [Sacri∣ficare] quomodò non∣nulli interpretati sunt, praeter mentem Scrip∣turae. The word [Facere] saith he, is not the same with [Sacrificare,] as some doe expound it, besides the meaning of Scrip∣ture {fleur-de-lys}. Next, Injurious to antiquity, which (as is confessed) Qùod olim dici∣mus, Missas facere, Ve∣teres quo{que} dixerunt Divina mysteria cele∣brare. Hilar. &c. Ex Cassand. Liturg cap. 16. called Doing Masse the Celebration of the Sacrament. Besides, In∣jurious to your owne Masse, in the Canon inserted byAlexander Papa & Martyr, Passionem Domini inserens Ca∣noni Missae, ait, [Hoc quoticscunque fece∣ritis,] Id est, Bene∣dixeritis, Fregeritis, Distribueritis, &c. Id. Cassander ibid. cap. 29. Alexan∣der Pope and Martyr, of the Primitive age, in these words; [Doe this as often] that is, Blesseit, Breakeit, Distributeit, &c. A plaine and direct Interpretation of the words [Doe this.] Lastly, Injuri∣ous to S. Paul, who, in his Comment upon the words of Christ his Institution, doth put the matter out of question, 1 Cor. 11. where, after the words [Doe this, as often as you doe it, in remem∣brance of mee,] vers. 25. immediately expounding what was meant by Doing, expresseth the Acts of Doing, thus; As often as ye shall eat this Bread, and drinke this Cup, &c. Which his Command of Doing, by Eating and Drinking, was spoken generally to all the faithfull in Corinth; that you may not imagine it was wholly restrained to the sacrificing Priests.
Other Romish Doctors also, if they had beene so sure of the force of the word [FACITE,] as your Cardinall seemeth to be, then surely would they not have sought to prove it from Virgils Calfe, where it is said; Cùm faciam Vitulâ—and were there∣fore noted by Calvin and Chemnitius of bold Ignorance. But these two Protestants, for so saying, have beene since branded by your Operae-pretium erit imposturam Ad∣versariorum refutate. Calvinus fingit Ca∣tholicos ità probare Propositionem nostri argumenti ex Virgilii verbis, Cùm faciam vitulâ, &c. Et Kem∣nitius ridet Catholi∣cos.—sed errant, nee bonâfide referunt argumenta Catholi∣corum. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 12. Cardinall with a marke of Imposture, as if they had falsly taxed your Romish Authors of such fondnesse. But now what shall we say to such a Gnostick, who, as though he had known what all the Doctors in the Church of Rome had then written and vented, durst thus engage his word for every one? It may be, hee presu∣med, that none of them could be so absurd. But your Iansenius will quit the report of Calvin and Chemnitius from the suspicion of Falshood, who witnesseth, concerning some Romish Authors of his time, saying;Sunt qui ex verbo [Facite] Sacrificium ostendere conantur, quia aliquandò acci∣pitur pro Sacrificare, ut cum Vitgilius dicit—Cùm faciam Vitulâ profrugibus, ipse ve∣nito. Iansen Concor. in cum locum cap. 131. p. 904. There are some who endevour to prove the word [Facere] to be put for [Sacrificare] by that saying of Virgil,—Cùm faciam vitulâ. So he. And why might not they have beene as ab∣surd, as some others that came after, yea (by your leave)Et Poeta, Cùm faciam vitulâ, &c. Va∣lent. Ies. lib. 1. de Sacrif. Missa, c. 4. §. Fatentur. p. 519. Eam vim ha∣bet verbum Faciendi, ut cum Poeta dicit, Cùm faciam Vitulà, &c. Salmer. Ies. Tim. 9. Tract. 27. pag. 205. §. Septi. Ie∣suites themselves, of your Bellarmines owne Society, who in like maner have consulted with the Poet Virgil about his Calfe; but as wisely (according to our Proverb) as Walton's Calfe, which went &c. For the matter Subject of the Poets Sacrifice is there ex∣pressed to have beene Vitula, a Calfe. You have failed in your first Objection. That a Proper Sacrifice cannot be collected out of any of these words of Christs Institution; Is GIVEN, Is BROKEN, Is SHED. SECT. II. THe Text is Luc. 22. 20. [Which Is broken, Is given, Is shed] in the Present Tense; and This Is the Cup of the new Testament in my Blood; wherein, according to the Greeke, there is a vary∣ing of the Case: whereupon your Disputers, as if they had cryed , are commonly more Instant in this Objection than in any other: some of them spending eight full leaves in pressing this Text, by two Arguments, one in respect of the Case, and another in regard of the Time. Of the Grammer point, concerning the Case. This is the new Testament in my Blood: Now what of this? Bellarm. de Missa, lib. 3. cap. 12. In Graeco Textu , di∣cit, Calix qui fundi∣tur, non hic est sanguis qui funditur: itaque indicant sanguinem fundi, ut erat in Calice. It is not said (saith your Cardinall) This is the Blood shed for you, but, This is the Cup shed for you: Therefore is hereby meant. The Blood, which was in the Chalice, because wine could not be said to bee shed for us for remission of sinnes. But how gather you this? Because in the
. Greeke (saith M.M. Breerly Liturg. tract. . c. 3. subd. 2. Brerely) , This Cup shed for you, varieth the Case from the word [Sanguine] and the Genus from the word [Testamentum,] and agreeth evidently with Calix: so that the Cup being said to be shed, proveth the Blood spoken of to bee shed ve∣rily in the Cup: which drives Beza unto a strange Answer, saying that this is a Soloe cophanes, or Incongruity of speech. So he; which Objection he learned peradventure of theRhemists Annot. upon Luc. 22. 20. Rhemists, who are vehement in pressing the same: their Conclusion is, This proveth the Sacri∣fice of Christ's blood in the Chalice; as also your IesuiteGordonus Scotus Ies. l. 1. Controvers. 3. c. 12. nu. 6. [] est nominativi casus necessariò referendū ad , non da∣tivi , ut pertineatad . Gordon hath done. In which one Collection they labour upon many igno∣rances. 1. As if a Soloecophanes were a prophanation of Scrip∣ture, by Incongruity of speech; which (as oneRodolph. Goclenius Professor Marpurg Pro∣blem. Gram. lib . De∣mosthenes —Pro . Cic. 2. de Orat.

Protestant hath proved) is used as an Elegancie of speech by the two Princes of Orators, Demosthenes for the Greeke, and Tully for the Latine; and by the two Parents of Poets, among the Greeks Homer, and by Virgil among the Latines. 2. As though these our Adversaries were fit men to upbraid Beza with one Soloecophanes, which is but a Seeming Incongruity, like a Seeming Limping, who themselves confesseSixtus Senensis Bi∣blioth. lib. 8. pag. ult. Nos ingenuè fatemur nonnullas mendas in hac nostra editlona inveniri, etiam Soloe∣cismos, & Barbaris∣mos, hyperbata, &c. Ingenuously, that in their Vulgar Latine Translation (which is decreed by the Councell of Trent to be Authenticall) there are meere Solecismes, and Barbarismes, and other faults, which wee may call, in point of Grammar, downe right halting. 3. As if a Truth might not be delivered in a Barbarous speech, or that this could be denied by them, who defend Solecismes, and Barbarismes, which had crept into the Translation of Scriptures, saying thatRhemists Preface before the New Testa∣ment. Ancient Fathers and Doctors have had such a religious care of former Translations, that they would not change their Barbarisines of the Vulgar Latine Text, [as unbent, & unbentur] and the like. 4. As if there were not the like Soloecophanes of Relatives not agreeing with their Antece∣dents in case, whereof you have received fromD. Fulke against Greg. Martin. D. Fulke divers Apoc. l. 4 & 8. 9. & 3. 12, &c. Examples. 5. As if this Soloecophanes now objected were not justifiable, which is defended by the Mirrour of Grammarians Ioseph. Sciligeri No∣ta in novum Testamen∣tum. Luc. 22. 20. : Mera est An∣tiptósis, pro . Beza re∣ctè exponit, & ait du∣plicem esse Metony∣miam. Ioseph Scaliger, by a figure Antiptôsis; and Beza (saith hee) doth truly expound it. Besides it is explained anciently by. Basil. Reg. Moral. 21. Basil a per∣fect Greek Father: referring the Participle [Shed] unto the word Blood, and not unto the Chalice; which marteth your Market quite. And that this is an undeniable Truth, will appeare in our Answer to the next Objection of Time: for if by Given, Broken, and Shed, is meant the time future, then these words Shed for you, for remission of sinnes, flatly conclude that hereby is not meant any proper Sacrifice of Christs Blood in the Cup, but on the Crosse. {fleur-de-lys} Lastly, if wee shall answer, that the Cup, indeed, is ta∣ken for the Liquor in the Cup, which is called Christs Blood, per Metonymiain, that is, Figuratively, the signo for the name of the thing Signified (whereof you have heard plentifull examples thorowout the second Book) you shall never be able to make any Reply. One word more. Seeing that it is the universall
Confession of all your Doctors, yea, even of the Objectors themselves, thatSee Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 4. and in this Sect. in their owne words. Christs blood is not perfectly shed in the Eucharist, how then can it stand with common modesty, to pretenda Proper Sacrifice in the word [Shed? {fleur-de-lys}] Let us proceed there∣fore to that point, that you may know that Beza needed not a Soloecophanes, to assoile this doubt. Of the Time signified by the Participles Given, Broken, Shed. These words being of the Present time, Therefore it plainly followeth that Breaking, Giving Christs Body, and shedding his Bloud, is in the Supper, and not on the Crosse: So yourBellarm. lib. 1. de iss. cap. 12.

Rhemists, and Mr Breerly, as dancing merrily after their Pipes;M. Breerly, Liturg. Tract. 3. §. 3. subd. 1. p. 319. This point (saith hee) is clearly determined by the Evangelists themselves, in their owne originall writings, Broken, Gi∣ven, Shed. AndIbid. subd. 3. p. 319. The Evasions, which our Adversaries seeke, whereby to avoid this, are enforced, racked and miserable shifts. And againe, for corroboration-sake.Ibid. subd. 1. p. 317. The word Broken also, spoken in regard of the outward formes, which are in time of Sacrificing, is more forci∣ble, because not meant of the Crosse: for when they saw hee was dead, fulfilling the Prophecie [A Bone of him shall not be broken] they brake not his legges, Ioh. 19. 33. {fleur-de-lys} And will you see your Iesuite Gordon, frisking and keeping the same measure; urging the present-Tense of the word, Broken, Given, Shed; calling this the Chiefe reason, and most evident for proofe of a Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christs Body in the Masse? and censuring Protestants for saying that in the same words the Present Tense is put for the Future; and that Broken doth signifie the Renting of Christs flesh with whips and nailes: which he termeth a seeking of refuge in Tropes and Figures, as that which cannot bee proved by any Scrip∣ture. So he, with these others, most ostentatively, as you have heard {fleur-de-lys}. Alas! what huge Anakims and Giants have we to deale withall! no Argument can proceed from them but most Evident, Forcible, and Invincible; yet may we not despaire of due Resistance, especially, being supported by your owne Brethren, as well the sonnes of Anak, as were the other: be∣sides, some better aid, both from Fathers and Scriptures, for proofe that these words Broken, Given, Shed, spoken in the Pre∣sent time doe signifie the Future time of Christs body being Broken, and Bloudshed; and both Given up as a Sacrifice instantly after upon the Crosse.

But what need have we of the severall members, when as the whole Body of your Romish Church is for us, rendring the word, Shed, in the Future Tense [Fundetur] shall be shed, as refer∣red to the Crosse? What thinke you by this? say M. Breerly. Liturg. Tract. . §. 3. subd. 1. Our Adversaries are in great straits, when they are glad to appeale from the Originall Greeke Text which they call Authenticall, unto the Latine Vulgar Translation, which they call old, rotten, and full of cor∣ruptions. This were well objected indeed, if that Protestants should alleage your Vulgar Latine Edition, as a purer Translation, and not as a true Interpretation of the words of the Text; to teach you that it is meant of the Future Time: and that this were urged by them, as a ground of perswasion to themselves, and not rather (as it were by the Law of Armes) an Oppositi∣on, and indeed conviction upon their Adversaries, who by the Decree of your Councell of Trent, are boundSee hereafter Book. . Not to reject it up∣on any pretence whatsoever. And to have this your owne Authenti∣call Translation to make against you, is to be in straits indeed, because all the Decrees of that Councell, by the Bull of Pope Pius 4. are put upon you to be beleeved under the bond of an Oath. Is it possible for you to shake off these shackles? Yes, M. Breerly can, by an admirable tricke of wi:Liurg. in the place above cited. Neverthelesse (saith hee) I answer in behalfe of the Vulgar Interpreter, that as he translateth in the Future Tense, [which shall be shed] so doth hee use the Present Tense in the other words, Given, and Broken, to signifie that it was then given in the Sacrament, and afterwards to be given upon the Crosse, both together. As if you should tell us in plaine English that your Church in her Vulgar Latine Text doth equivocate, teaching that It shall be shed, in the Future, doth signifie also the Present Tense, Is shed, that is, It is, shall be, both together. A fit man (for∣sooth) to inveigh against a Soloecophanes. {fleur-de-lys} Your Iesuite Vasquez doubtlesse would have laughed at the ridiculousnesse of this mans defence of the Vulgar Translation,Vasquez Ies in 3. Thom. Quest. 78. Disp. 199. Cap. 1. Art. 3.

[Ef∣fundetur in .] who contrariwise, that he might prove the Vulgar, in using the Present Tense in [Datur, Is given] to understand thereby the Future Tense, [Dabitur, shall be given] doth observe with us, that the same Vulgar Translation useth the Future Tense not onely concer∣ning the Blood, in [Fundetur,] but also concerning the Body, in [Tradetur. {fleur-de-lys}] But how then can Protestants interpret the Present to signifie the Future? We tell you, because you have in Scriptures, and other Authours, thousands of Examples of the Present tense put for the Future, to signifie the certainty or instan∣cie of that which is spoken: but it was never heard nor read, that the Future Tense was taken for the Present Tense, because there is no Course nor Progresse to the time past. And if, Shed, be taken not in true sense, then shall it be lawfull for every pettie Romish Priest at every Masse-saying to correct your Romish Missall,
authorized by the same Tridentine Fathers, which hath it,Missale Rom. Ca∣li Sanguinis—qui effundetur. Shall be Shed. {fleur-de-lys} If this will not serve, we refer you to your owne other Vasqu.

He urged the word, Broken, that because this could not be meant of Broken on the Crosse, for that His Legs were not there broken, (according as it was prophesied) therefore it must inferre it to have beene Broken at his Supper, when he utte∣red the word Broken. Which is like his other maner of Reasons, blunt, and broken at the point, as it became one not much con∣versant in Scripture: else might he have answered himselfe by another Prophecie, teaching that the word, Broken, is taken Me∣taphorically by the Prophet Esay, Chap. 53. speaking of the cruci∣fying and Agonies of Christ, and saying, He was Broken for our iniquities▪ (namely, as two of yourSaron Ies.

AS for our selves, we, before all other Reasons, and against all opposition whatsoeuer, take our light from the same Scripture (immediately after the Text objected) wherein it is said of Iudas,Luc. 22. 2.

What, my Masters, is there no learning but under your Romish caps? That the Objected words of Christ, and the whole Text, do utterly overthrow the pretended Sacrifice in the Romish Masse. SECT. IV. AMong the words of Institution, the first which offereth it selfe to our use, is the formerly-objected word, BROKEN; which word (said your IesuiteSee above Booke 2. Chap. 2. Suarez) is taken unproperly, be∣cause in the proper and exact acception it should signifie a dividing of the Body of Christ into parts. So hee, and that truely. Else why (wee pray you) is it, that your Romane Church hath left out of her Masse the same word [Broken] used by Christ in the words, which you terme Words of Consecration? But although you (peradventure) would be silent, yet your BishopEx qua intelli∣ge, ea verba [Quod pro vobis frangitur] non esse ad Conse∣crationem necessaria: sed consultò a Lati∣nis praetermissa, ne esset locus absurda intelligentiae, quà quis existimare pos∣sit vere frangi Corpus Christi. Ians. Concord. c. 131. in Matth. 26. Ian∣senius will not forbeare to tell us, that It was left out, lest that any man might conceive so fondly, as to thinke the Body of Christ to be truly Broken. So hee. It is well. The word, [Shed] is the next, which properly signifieth the issuing of blood out of the veines of Christ; But, That Blood of Christ (saith yourBellarm. lib. 1. de Missa; c. 12. §. Ad secundum. Sanguis Christi reipsa non e∣greditur de Corpore. Cardinall, speaking of the first Institu∣tion) did not passe out of his Body. Even asSee above Booke 4. Chap. 2. Sect. 3. Aquinas had said before him. But most emphatically your Alphonsus.Alfonsus lib 6 adversus Haeres. Tit. Eucharistia. haeres ult. Cum Sanguinem pro nobis semel in ara Crucis effusum, post resurrectionem nun∣qū eum fuurus sit: convincitur inde eti∣am, nunquā sangui∣nem verum illius in∣tegrè alicubi esse sine ejus corpore vero.—Sol. Ob. Quamvis sub specie vini totus Christus lateat, non tamen species illae totum Christum sig∣nificant, sed solùm sangumem effusum in Cruce, & à cor∣pore separatum. Christ his Blood was once Shed upon the Crosse, never to be Shed againe after his Resurrection, which cannot be perfectly separated from his Body. And accordingly your JesuiteCoste. Enchi∣rid c. 9. de Sacrificio. §. Ex quibus. Christus veram sanguinis effu∣sionem passus in cru∣ce, sanguine ipso à Corpore separato. Hic vero tantum il∣lius mortis repraesen∣tatio. Coster; The true effusion of his Blood, which is by separating it from the Body, was onely on the Crosse. So they. Hearken now. These words, Blood shed, and Body broken, were spoken then by Christ, and are now recited by your Priest ei∣ther in the proper Sense of Shedding, or they are not. If in a pro∣per Sense, then is it properly separated from his Body, (against your former Confession, and Profession of all Christians;) But if it be said to be Shed unproperly, then are your Objectors of a proper Sense of Christ his words to be properly called deceit∣full Sophisters, as men who speak not from conscience, but for contention: who being defeated in their first skirmish, about Christs words, do flie for refuge to his Acts, and Deedes, whi∣ther wee further pursue them.
That there was no Sacrificing Act in the whole Institution of Christ, which the Romish Church can justly pretend for de∣fence of her Proper Sacrifice; proved by your owne Confessions. SECT. V. THere are sixe Acts, which your Proctors, who plead for a proper Sacrifice, do pretend for proofe thereof, as being ascribable to the Institution of Christ, and are as readily and roundly confuted by their owne fellowes, as they were by o∣thers frequently and diligently sought out, or vehemently ob∣jected: which the Marginals will manifest unto you, in every particular, to be no essentiall Acts of a proper Sacrifice. 1.

Vasquez but leave to crowd into this Presse of Opinators, hee will shoulder them all out; not only those, who stand for Fraction, Oblation, or Consumption, or any thing else, excepting the Sole Act of Con∣secration: but hee will also exempt the Explications of all Others, hee himselfe standing wholly for his owne opinion of Sole Consecration: who ordereth the different sorts of Expositors (whom hee calleth Moderne Divines) into foure Rankes, proving all their Expositions to be Absurd. The first so Absurd, as to make that the Sacrifice, which is not now Sacrificed, but only about to be Sacrificed. The second so, as if Wood, changed into a Sheepe, should be therefore held a Sacrifice. The fourth so, as if they would make Bread, and not Christ, a Sacrifice. The last so, as if the Cha∣lice should be therefore accounted a Sacrifice, because it is Consecrated. And having thus as it were, cashiered all his fellow-Souldiers, that stood in his way hee placeth insteed of all other the whole and sole Act in Consecration, by way of Representation. So they of these Particulars, which are afterward discussed at large. {fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. COnsider now, wee pray you, that (as you AllTota Essentia Sacrificij pendet ex Institutione Christi. Suarez & Salmeron supra. confesse) The whole Essence of a Sacrifice dependeth upon the Institution of Christ. And thatNon est in po∣testate Ecclesiae in∣stituere Sacrificium. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 28. pag. 29. Idem alibi, vide sup. at (h) It is not in the power of the Church to or∣daine a Sacrifice. Next, that if any Sacrifice had beene insti∣tued, it must have appeared either by some Word, or Act of Christ, neither of which can be found, or yet any shadow thereof. What then (wee pray you) can make more both for the justifying of your owne Bishop of Bitontum, who feared not to publish in your Councell of Trent, before all their Father-hoods,
Quidam Bi∣tontinus Episcopus in Conc. Trid. (ut Ca∣nus & alij referunt) tentavit defendere, Christum in nocte Coeae non obtulisse Sacrificium. Suarez quo supra Disp. 74. Sect. 2. pag. 949. That Christ in his last Supper did not offer up any proper Sacrifice? As also for the condemning of your owne Romish Church for a Sacrilegious Depravation of the Sacrament of Christ? Vpon this their Exigence whither will they now? To other Scriptures of the new Testament, and then of the old. Out of the new are the two that follow. CHAP. II. That the other objected Scriptures, out of the new Testa∣ment, make not for any Proper Sacrifice among Christians, to witt, not Acts 13. 2. of []. SECT. I. ACTS 13. 2. Saint Luke reporting the publike Mi∣nisterie, wherein the Apostles with other devout Christians were now exercised, saith [,] which two of yourBaronius in An. 44. num. 83.

Vt Luc. 1. de Zacha∣ria. Et Claudius de Sanctes praef. in missas Graecorum. Cardinals translate, They sacrificing. But why Sacrificing, say wee, not some other ministerial Function, as Preaching (in which re∣spect S. Paul called himself , Rom. 15. 16.) or administring the Sacrament, seeing that the words may bear it? They answer us, because 1. This Ministerie is said to be done To the Lord, so is not Preaching. 2. For that the word [] when∣soever it is applyed to sacred Ministerie and used absolutely, it is alwayes taken for the Act of Sacrificing. So they. When wee should have answered this Objection, wee found our selves prevented by one, who for Greeke-learning hath scarce had his equall in this our age, namely, thatCasaubon Exer∣citat. 16. cap. 41. Vo∣cem hanc  usus Ecclesiae aptavit ministerio & cultui Dei publico, sed diversimodè. Apud Dionysium Areop, Diaconi dicun∣tur : in patrum libris fit mentio Liturgiae matutinae & vespertae: & in Actis Concilij Ephes notat Balsamon Liturgiam constare sola oratione sine ulla Sacramentorum administratione, peculiariter interdum ad celebrationem Eucharistiae, cujus Partes duae sunt, Recitatio Scripturarum, & Administratio Coenae. Iustiniani novella 7. Quod Bellarminus ait, quoties haec vox ad sacra accommodarur, & absolute ponitur, pro ministerio sacrificij sumitur, insignis est error, nam in exemplo quod subjungit Luc. 1. 23  non est Sacrificium, sed vox generalis omnia ministeria Sacerdotalia & Levitica complectitur. Zachariae autem, ut Lucas ait, con∣tigerat sors suffitus offerendi, non autem sacrificandi—Nec minus errat, quod scilicet vix aliter hanc vo∣cem à Patribus accipi, quàm pro ministerio sacrificij, quae observatio quàm sit aliena, satis ex dictis constat. Phenix M. Isaac Ca∣saubon. Looke upon the Margin, where you may find the word, , to have beene used Ecclesiastically for whatso∣ever religious ministration, (even for sole Praying, where there is no note or occasion of Sacrifice) and he instanceth in the Fa∣thers, mentioning the Morning and Evening  of the Church. But you will not say (wee thinke) that there was any proper Evening Sacrifice in use in those times.
What can you say for your Cardinall his former lavish asser∣tion, who is thus largely confuted? Nay, how shall you justi∣fie your selves, who are bound by Oath not to gain-say in your Disputations the Vulgar Latine Translation, which hath ren∣dred the same Greeke words [] Ministranti∣bus eis, that is, They ministring, and not, They sacrificing? which might be said as well of preaching, praying, admini∣string the Sacrament; all which (to meet with your other Objection) being done according to the will of God, and be∣longing to his worship and service, might be properly said to have beene done unto God. {fleur-de-lys} Even as well as it might be said of him, that eateth his common food with Giving God thanks, that hee Eateth to the Lord, Rom. 14. 6. else was Chrysostome farre wide, when hee, commenting upon the same words [Ministring to the Lord,] to the question, What is meant there by [] answereth;Chrysost. in Act: 13. Hom. 27. Quid est [Ministran∣tibus?]—Praedi∣cantibus. Prea∣ching. {fleur-de-lys} That the Second objected place out of the new Testament, to witt, 1. Cor. 10. cannot inferre any Proper Sacrifice. SECT. II. 1. Cor. 10. 18. BEhold Israel—are not they who eat of the Sacrifices partakers of the Altar? then vers. 20. 21. 22. But that which the Gentiles offer they offer to Devills, and not unto God, and I would not have you partakers with Devills: yee cannot drinke of the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devills: you cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and the Table of Devills. Hence Bellarmine;Postremum Argumentū ex Scri∣turis habetur, 1. Cor. 10. Vbi primò men∣sa Domini compara∣tur cum Altari Gen∣tilium. Ergo, Mensa Domini est quod∣dam Altare, & pro∣inde Eucharistia Sa∣crificium. . Ita vult Sacrificium Deo ob∣tum in Eucharistia, sicut sunt Sacrificia à Iudaeis Deo, vel à Gentilibus Daemo∣nibus suis oblata. 3. Deceita mandu∣cantem Eucharistiam participem esse. Alta∣ris Dominici, ut manducans Idolo∣thyta particeps erat Altaris Idolorum, per Sacrificia. Ergo Eucharistia est Sacri∣ficium. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa cap. 14. Here (saith hee) the Table of the Lord is compared with the Altar of the Gentiles: Therefore is the Table of the Lord certainely an Altar, and there∣fore it hath a Sacrifice. 2. Because the Eucharist is so offered, as were the Sacrifices of the Iewes. And 3. Because hee that eateth the Eucharist is said so to be partaker of the Lord's Altar, as the Heathen of things sacrificed to Idolls are said to be partakers of the Idolls Altar. So hee; following only his owne sense, and not regarding the voyce or judgement of any other. If wee should say, in Answer to his first Objection, that your Cardi∣nall wanted his spectacles, in reading of the Text, when hee said that the Apostle compareth the Table of the Lord, whereon the Eucharist is placed, with the Altar of the Gentiles (which was the Altar of Devills) it were a friendly answer in his be∣halfe; for the words of the Text expressely relate a Compari∣son of the Table of the Lord with the Table of Gentiles, and De∣vills; and not with their Altar.
{fleur-de-lys} Can you then guesse what Spirit it was that moved your Cardinall thus to falsifie the sacred Text, to the end that hee might conclude the Romish Sacrifice from the Altar of De∣vils? Even that wherewith the Fathers of the Councell Conc. Trident. Sess. 22. cap. 1. Quam oblationem non ob∣scurè innuit Aposto∣lus Paulus Corinthi∣is scribens, cum di∣cit: non posse eos, qui participatione mensae Daemonio∣rum polluti sunt, mensae Domini par∣ticipes fieri: per mensam, Altare u∣trobique intelligens. of Trent, when they (although to the Confutation of Bellarmines errour) acknowledged the words of the Apostle to be, Table of the Lord, and Table of Devils, yet doe they impose upon you a Beliefe, that The Apostle doth in both, by Table, understand Altar, thereby turning a Table into an Al∣tar; albeit these two differed no lesse than Offering (which was onely upon the Altar) and Eating of things offered, which was never but upon a Table; and as much as Priest, (who only did minister at the Altar) differeth from Com∣mon people, who did joyntly communicate of Idolothytes by eating them upon a Table, as will be more fully mani∣fested, in Chap. 5. Sect. 15. {fleur-de-lys} And although the Hea∣then had their Altars, yet (which crosseth all the former Obje∣ctions) their common Eating of things sacrificed unto Idols was not upon Altars, but upon Tables, in feasting and partaking of the Idolothytes, and not in Sacrificing, as did also theAenaeid. 8. post Sacrificium Ae∣naeas invitatus est ad Epulas. Gentiles, as is to be seeneChap. 5. Sect. 15. hereafter. The whole scope of the Apostle is to dehort all Christians from communicating with the Heathen in their Idol-solemni∣ties whatsoever; and the summe of his Argument is, that whosoever is Partaker of any Ceremonie, made essentiall to any worship professed, hee maketh himselfe a Partaker of the profession it selfe, whether it be Christian, vers. 16. or Iewish, vers. 18. or Heathenish and Devillish, vers. 20. And againe, the Apostle's Argument doth as well agree with a Religious Table, as with an Altar; with a Sacrament, as with a Sacri∣fice, and so it seemeth yourAquinas. Non potestis Cali∣cem Domini bibere & Daemoniorum si∣mul.] Quoad sacra∣mentum fanguinis, Non potestis mensae Domini participes es∣se: quoad Sacramen∣tum corporis, & mē∣sae Daemoniorum. In 1. Cor. 0. Aquinas thought, who para∣phraseth thus upon the Text; You cannot bee partakers of the Table of the Lord, in respect of the Sacrament of the Lords Body, and of the table of Devils. To an Objector, who avoucheth no Father for his Assertion, it may be sufficient for us to op∣pose, albeit but any one. Primasius therefore, expounding this Scripture, maketh the Comparison to stand thus:See above Booke 5 Chap. 8 Sect. . at the letter (). As our Saviour said; Hee that eateth my flesh abideth in mee, so the ea∣ting of the Bread of Idols is to be partakers of the Devils. But this participation of Devills must needs be spirituall, and not corporall; you know the Consequence.
CHAP. III. That no Scripture in the old Testament hath beene justly produced, for proofe of a Pro∣per Sacrifice in the Eucharist. THe Places of Scripture, selected by your Disputers, are partly Typicall, and partly Propheticall. That the first objected Typicall Scripture, concerning Melchi∣sedech, maketh not for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist. SECT. I. The State of the Question. VVEE are loth to trouble you with Dispute about the end of Melchisedech his ministring Bread and Wine to Abraham, and his Company; whether it were as a matter of Sacrifice unto God; or (as{fleur-de-lys} Others have beene alleged for this Exposition, viz. Io∣sephus and Cajetan in Gen. 14. & some Fa∣thers, who in the very phrase of [] and, obtulit, said that it was offered to Abraham. Epiphan. Hom. 55. August. in Quaest. utriusque Te∣stam. Tom. 4. Am∣bros. de Sacram. lib. 4. Cap. 3. Tertull. adversus Iudaeos Cap. 3. But [obtulit ei] which was to Abraham, in the proper acception of Sacrificing, had beene Sacrilegious, as you very well know. {fleur-de-lys} Divers have thought) only for re∣freshing the wearie Souldiers of Abraham; because the Question is brought to be tried by the judgement of such Fathers, who have called it a Sacrifice. Wherefore wee yeeld unto you the full scope, and suppose (with yourBellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. Cardinall) that the Bread and Wine brought forth had beene sacrificed by Melchisedech to God, and not as a Sacrifice administred by him to his Guests. Now, because whatsoever shall be objected will concerne either the matter of Sacrifice, or else the Priest-hood and office of the Sacrificer, wee are orderly to handle them both.
That the Testimonies of the Fathers, for proofe of a Proper Sacri∣fice in the Eucharist, from the Type of Melchisedech's Sacrifice, are Sophistically, and unconscionably ob∣jected out of Psalm. 110. and Heb. 5. SECT. II. SOme of the objected Testimonies (See theBellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. ex Ambrosio. Panem & Vinum obtulit. De Sacram. lib. 5. cap. 1.

Margin) com∣paring the Sacrifice of Melchisedech to the Eucharist, in the name of a Sacrifice, do relate no further than Bread and Wine, calling these Materialls, The Sacrifice of Christians: such are the Testimonies of Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostome, Theophy∣lact, Oecumenius, and Cassidore, together with two Iewish Rab∣bins; promising that at the coming of Christ all Sacri∣fices should cease, Except the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine in the Eucharist. This is your first Collection, for proofe that the Eucharist is a Proper Visible Sacrifice. But first Vnconscionably, knowing andSee hereafter Chap. 5. Sect. 1. confessing it to be no better than a Iewish Con∣ceipt, to thinke the Bread and Wine to be properly a Sacrifice of the new Testament. Wherefore, to labour to prove a Pro∣per Sacrifice, in that which you know and acknowledge to be no Proper Sacrifice, do you not blush? How much better had it becomne you to have understood the Fathers to have used the word Sacrifice in a large sense, as it might signifie any sacred ministration, as Isidore doth instruct you? Who, if you aske him what it is, which Christians do now offer after the order of Melchisedech? he will say, that it is Bread and Wine.Isidor. Victimas jam, non qua∣les Iudaei, sed quales Melchisedech offerunt credentes: id est, Panem & Vinum. id est, Corporis & Sangui∣nis Sacramentum. Lib. de Vocat. Gent. cap. 26. That is (saith hee) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood. Even as Hierome long before him;Hiero. Epist. ad Evag. Pane & Vino simplice, puro{que} Sacrificio Christo dedicaverit Sacramentum. Melchisedech in plaine Bread and Wine did dedicate the Sacrament of Christ: distinguishing both the Sa∣crament from a Proper Sacrifice, and naming the thing, that is sayd in a sort to be offered, Not to be the Body and Blood of Christ, but the Sacrament of both. {fleur-de-lys} And as well might you have produced Augustine, who is as expresse as any, teaching that the Church now, as well as Melchisedech then, Aug. contr. Advers. Leg. & Proph. lib. 3. cap. 20. Tom. 6.

Testimonies of Cyprian and Hierome, as also of Eusebius, who doth onely make an Analogie betweene the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist, and the Bread and Wine, which Melchisedech brought forth, and wherein Hee, as in Types, saw the Mysteries of Christs Body and Blood. Eucherius and Pri∣masius both say, that Christ offered Bread and Wine, that is, his Body and Blood, like as Melchisedech did, or according to the order of Melchisedech. which Body and Blood of Christ you will All sweare (wee dare say) was not the proper Subject mat∣ter of the Sacrifice of Melchisedech, who performed his Sacri∣fice many thousands of yeares before our Lord Christ was in∣carnate in the flesh, to take unto him either Body, or Blood. And therefore could not the Fathers understand, by the Sacri∣fice of Christs Body and Blood, any thing but the Type of Christ his Body and Blood; these being then the Object of Melchise∣dech's faith, as the cited Sentences of Hierome and Eusebius do declare. Which is a second proofe of the unconscionable dea∣ling of your Disputers, by inforcing Testimonies against com∣mon sense. But will you see furthermore the Vnluckinesse of your game, and that three maner of wayes? First, your ordinary guize is to object the word Sacrifice out of the Fathers, as properly used, whereas your Allegations tell us, that they used it in a greater latitude, and at liberty. Secondly, and more princi∣pally, wheresoever you heare the Fathers naming Bread and Wine the Body and Blood of Christ, ô then behold Transubstanti∣ation of Bread into Christ his Body; and behold it's Corporall presence, and that most evidently! this is your common shout. And yet behold in your owne objected Sentences of Fathers, that which was most really Bread and Wine of Melchisedech, was notwithstanding by the forenamed Fathers called the Bo∣dy and Blood of Christ. A most evident Argument that the Fa∣thers understood Christ's words, in calling Bread his Body, figuratively. {fleur-de-lys} A Vindication of the Truth of my former Allegations, against a Calumnious Romanist. MY Lord of Durham (saith hee) cryes out against Bel∣larmine, that his former Testimonies are unconsconably alleaged; and yet halfe of them hee skippeth over without any shew of Answer. To the rest he answereth two things; First, that some of their Testimonies relate no further then to Bread and Wine, making these Materials the Sacrifice of Christians. To this purpose hee quoteth many Testimonies, whereof no one doth justifie his Pretence, but many of them doe plainely confute and directly contra∣dict it.
Answer. To have cryed out of Vnconscionablenesse against any man, without just Cause, had beene Injurious; To have skipped over any Testimony, which might be thought not sufficiently answered in the Confutation of the other Testimonies cited, had beene Diffidence; To have quoted them, and not to the purpose, had beene meere Childishnesse. But so to have quoted them, that they should contradict my purpose, had beene starke madnesse. The first point of my Vindication must be, to set downe the other Testimonies, which (hee saith) have beene skipped over. This is nowBellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. Theod. in Psal. 109.

As they are cited by Bellar∣mine. performed in the Margin. The next Exception is, that they make nothing to my pur∣pose, my purpose being to shew that the Testimonies obje∣cted speake not of Christ's. Body and Blood, but only of the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine. These are fully to this pur∣pose, how then do they Contradict this Pretence? Give you mee but leave to Appeale to the Testimonies them∣selves, which are here (and in the former Section) cited out of your owne Cardinall, visible before you in the Margin, and I shall desire no other Iudge than the most partiall among your Romish Priests, to determine whether these Testimonies goe any further than was alleged, to wit, Mel∣chisedech offered Bread and Wine, which is now offered. Item, He sacrifised in Bread and Wine, wherein hee dedicated this Sacrament of Christ. (But yet in Bread and Wine.) Item, In Bread and Wine, which the whole world now celebrateth. Item, In the same Bread and Wine now celebrated in the Eucha∣rist, and the like. And in the last place I made good my Outcry against Bellarmine and other Objectors, for their Vn∣conscionablenesse in concluding a Proper Sacrifice in the Eu∣charist, from the Testimonies of Fathers,See this Trea∣tise of the Masse, Booke 6. Chap. 5. §. 1 which menti∣oned onely the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine herein; which Sacrifice of Bread and Wine the Romish Objectours them∣selves do absolutely deny to be any Proper Sacrifice. Than which maner of Arguing, what can be more Vnconsciona∣ble, and lesse to the purpose? A second Vindication of my second kinde of Allegations and Exceptions, against the Calumnies of the same Romish Seducer. Heare your Romanist. His second Pretence is, that the other of the Fathers Testimonies say that Melchi∣sedech offered the Body and Blood of Christ, which yet
is not said to be offered or continued by any of them, but only by Saint Cyprian and Saint Hierome. So hee. Answer. There needeth no more, for my discharge, than to apply the Sentences of the Fathers above-cited to the point in Question. Christ (saith Cyprian) offered up the same which Melchisedech offered, to wit, his Body and Blood. Plaine. Againe, Bellarmine in his Chapter concerning Melchisedech produceth Hierome saying of this Bread and Wine offered, that it is the Body and Blood of Christ. This is as Plaine. Eucherius and Primasius do both say, that Christ offered Bread and Wine, that is the Body and Blood of Christ, even as did Melchisedech. As plaine as the former. Now for any Ro∣manist to reprove all this, without any Proofe to the Con∣trary, bewrayeth both Impotencie in not effecting, and Im∣pudencie in attempting his pretended Confutation. {fleur-de-lys} That the Apostle to the Hebrewes, in comparing Melchisedech with Christ, did not intimate any Analogie betweene the Sacrifice of Melchisedeth, and of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist. SECT. III. BVt,Bellar. Non videtur posse negari, &c. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. § Accedit. you pre-occupate, viz. The Apostle, speaking of Melchisedech, saith, [Of whom I had much to say, and that which is uninterpretable, because you are dull of hearing.] Chap. 5. vers. 11. Whence it may seeme (saith your Cardinall) a thing undeniable, that the Apostle meant thereby the Mysterie of the Eu∣charist, because it was above their capacity, and therefore hee purposely forbare to mention either Bread or Wine. So your An∣swerer. To whom you may take, for a Reply as in our behalfe, the Confession of your much-esteemed Jesuite Ribera, who telleth you thatRibera Ies. Id non ideò dixerat, quod sermonem illū tracere vellet, erat e∣nim id, id quod in hac Epistol agit, valdè accommoda∣tum, sed ut magis il∣los excitatet studio audiendi, & intenti∣ores redderet—Non desperat Paulus quae scripturus est posse ab illis percipi, si animū attendant, aut certè à nonnullis eorum, qui eruditio∣res erant, per quos caeteri etiam paula∣tim intelligerent. Cā. in Heb. 6. num. 1. Where also hee hath these words: Cum illorum & imbecilli∣tatem & tarditatem accusat, idcirco facit, ut pudore ad melius intelligenda incitarentur: [Missa nunc faciamus rudimenta, & ad perfectionem seramur.] Hc est, Date operam ut mecum intelligatis, quae perfectis dici solent. The Apostle naming it a thing Inexplicable, and calling them Dull, meant not thereby to conceale the matter implyed (which was so pertinent to that hee had in hand) from them, because of the want of their Capacity: but did, in so saying, rather excite them to a greater Attention; shewing thereby that hee did not despaire, but that they were capable of that which hee would say; at least the learned among them, by whom others might have learned by little and little. So hee, proving the same out of those words of the Apostle, [Passing by the Rudiments, &c.
Let us goe on unto perfection:] that is, (saith hee) Do your dili∣gence in hearing, that you may attaine unto the understanding of these things, which are delivered unto those that are perfect. This is the Briefe of his large Comment hereupon. {fleur-de-lys} Wee may here take up the Argument commonly used by all Protestants, to prove that although Christ be, in many respects, resemblable to Melchisedech, in his Priesthood most properly; yet that in the maner of his Sacrifice not so: because then the Proper Sacrifice of Christ and Christians should be in Bread and Wine, as was that of Melchisedech. But the Sa∣crifice of Christ and Christians is not offering Bread and Wine. Therefore cannot Christ be resembled to Melchi∣sedech in the matter and nature of the Sacrifice. This Argument wee formerly forbare to urge, because wee wanted the Assent of any of your Romish Doctors herein. But now wee have found, among your Jesuites, one confirming our Consequence, and saying, that Christ being considered to be a Priest after the order of Melchisedech, in respect of the matter of the Sacrifice,Iac. Gordon. Scot Ies. Contro∣vers. Contr. 9. Cap. 3. num. 1.

It is necessary that Christ, besides his bloody Sacrifice on the Crosse, should of∣fer an unbloody Sacrifice of Bread and Wine. Nor can you justly oppose against our Assumption, which is, that the Proper Sacrifice of Christ and Christians is not the offering of Bread and Wine; because this is the universall, absolute, and constant Consequence of your Romish Doctors, judging and censuring the Contrary Assertion of this Jesuite to be Iewish and Absurd, as you may finde in the fift Chapter fol∣lowing, Sect. 1. {fleur-de-lys} Notwithstanding, what our Opposites faile of, in the point of Sacrifice, they intend to gaine from the Title of Priesthood. Of the Priesthood of Melchisedech, as it is compared with the pretended Romish Priesthood, out of the Epistle to the Hebrewes. SECT. IV. The State of the Question.

of Christ, [A Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech:] which, because it is perpetuall and eternall, cannot be performed properly by Christ himselfe, and therefore must be executed by his Ministers, as Vicars on earth. So hee, accordingly as your Concil. Tri∣dent. Sess. 22. Ca. 1.

Sand. de  Monarch. lib. 1. pag 20 §. Quae . Originally from Melchisedech. This is a matter of great moment, as will appeare; which wee shall resolve by cer∣taine Positions. The foundation of all the Doctrine, concerning Christ and Melchisedech, is set downe in the Epistle to the Hebrewes. That the Analogie betweene Melchisedech his Priesthood, and the eternall Priesthood of Christ in himselfe, is most perfect, and so declared to be, Heb. 5, 6, 7, Chapp. SECT. V. THe holy Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrewes, compa∣ring the Type Melchisedech with the Arch-Type Christ Ie∣sus, in one order of Priesthood, sheweth betweene Both an ab∣solute Analogie, although not in equality of Excellence, yet in similitude of qualities and offices. As first in Royalty, Melchisedech is calledHebr. 7. 2. The King of Iustice and Peace. So Christ (but infinitely more) is calledRom. 3. 26. Our Iustice and Peace. Se∣condly, Melchisedech, in respect of Generation, was without Generation from Father or Mother (according to the formality of Sacred Story:) so Christ, according to the verity of his Huma∣nity, without Father; and, in his divine nature, without Mother: of whom also it is written, Who shall declare his Generation? Thirdly, in Time, Melchisedech a Priest for ever, having neither beginning nor end of dayes (according to the same Historicall Tenure:) so Christ an eternall Priest, Chap. 5, 6. Fourthly, in Number, onely One, who had no Predecessor, nor Succes∣sor. So Christ, who acknowledged no such Priest before him, nor shall finde any other after him for ever. Fifthly, Christ was Vniversally King and Priest, as the Apostle noted, Chap. 7. 4. saying, That the Priesthood was changed from Aaron and Levi to Christ, in Iuda. That is, that Christs Power might be both Re∣gall, and Sacerdotall, saithMutatum Sa∣cerdotiu de Sacer∣dotali an Regalem, ut eadem ipsa sit Re∣galis & Sacerdotalis. Chrysost. in Heb. 7. Hom. 13 Fuit in Melchisedech singu∣laris dignitas, quod Sacerdotium admi∣nistrabatur per Re∣gem. Tese Greg. Valent. l. 1. de Missa. cap. 4. Chrysostome, which was a sin∣gular dignity, as your Jesuite well observeth.
That the nature of every other Priesthood (be it of your Romish High-Priest) dissenteth as much from the Priesthood of Melchisedech, as the Priesthood of Melchise∣dech agreeth with the Priesthood of Christ. SECT. VI. IF Comparison might be made of Priesthood, whom would you rather that wee should instance in, than in your intituled Summus Pontifex, that is, the High-Priest, your Pope: who not∣withstanding cannot be sayd to be a King, as Melchisedech, much lesse as Christ,Bellar.

Everlasting. Secondly, much lesse a King of Peace, who hath beene reproved by Antiquity for be∣ing Victor, Pa∣cis perturbator. Ire¦naeus apud Euseb. hist. lib 5 cap. 24.

Third∣ly, not King of Iustice, because some Popes have excited Sub∣jects and Sonnes to rebell against their Liege Soveraigns and Pa∣rents. Fourthly, not Originally without Generation, by either Father or Mother; some of them having beene borne in lawfull Wedlocke, and of knowne honest Parents: albeit of other∣some the Mothers side hath beene much the surer. It will be no Answer to say, as PopeNon secun∣dùm cdinē Aaron, cujus Sacerdotiū per propaginem sui se∣minis in ministerio temporali fuit, & cum Veteris Testa∣menti Lege cessavit: sed secundùm ordi∣nem Melchisedech, in quo aeterni Pon∣tificis forma praeces∣sit. Leo papa Serm. 2. in Annivers. die Assumpt. ad Pontif. Leo in effect did, viz. that, as Priests, you are not as were the Leviticall, by naturall Propagation; but by a Spirituall ordination: because a Spiri∣tuall propagation is no proper, but a metaphoricall Generation. Fifthly, not without Succession; seeing that Succession, as from S. Peter, is the chief tenure of your Priesthood. Nor will that of Epiphanius help you, in this Case, to say thatNunc sanè non amplius semen secun∣dùm successionem eligitur, sed forma juxta virtutem quaeritur. Epiphan. cont. Haeres. 55. You had no Suc∣cession by the seed of Aaron: because although this may exempt you from the Leviticall Priesthood, yet will not it associate you with the Priesthood of Melchisedech, or of Christ, whose Chara∣cters of Priesthood was to be Priests soly, individually, and abso∣lutely in themselues, without Succession by another. And this the words of the Apostle [] that is, Christ had an Intransmissible Priest-hood, do fully signifie. As little can your ordinary Answer availe, telling us that you are notSalmeron. Ies. Nos in Christo Sacerdotes sumus tanquam Vicarij—Satis est nobis illum Principem semper vivere. Com. in Heb. cap. 10. Disp 19. Successors, but Vicars of Christ, and Successors of
Peter; because, whilest you claime that the Visible Priest-hood and Sacrifice of Christ is still in the Church, which is perpe∣tuated by Succession, you must bid farewell to the Priest-hood of Melchisedech. But if indeed you disclaime all Succession of Christ, why is your Jesuite licensed to say, that yourRibera.

Ro∣man Popes do succeed Christ in their Pastorshp over the Church, al∣though not in their Priesthood, by offering Sacrifices, expiating sinnes by their owne virtue? Are not the Titles of Pastor and Priest equally transcendent in Christ? Againe, if you be Vicars of Christ, then are you not after the Order of Melchisedech, who is read to have had no more any Vicar, than that hee had either Father or Mother. Sixtly, not in respect of the no-necessity of a Succession, which wasHeb 7. 23.

Aaron indeed had Successors, and in the Legall Priest-hood, in processe of time, by reason of death one succeeded another: but our Lord had a Priesthood without Transition and Succession, being himselfe alwayes a faithfull High-Priest. From the same law of Mortality Theodoret concludeth likewise that Christ in the New TestamentTheod. in Heb. 7. Quemadmodum non habuerit Mel∣chisedech Successo∣res, ità nec hic ipsum ad alios transmittit.—Item. Qui ex le∣ge Sacerdotes sunt, quia motalem ha∣bent naturam, eâ de Causâ habent filios Successores: hic au∣tem quia immortalis non transmitur ad a∣lium munus Sacerdo∣j. Transmit∣teth not his Priesthood to any other. Wherein wee may say, that Theodoret was Scholler to Chrysostome,Chrysost. in Hebr. 7. Hom 13. Quia semper vivit, non habet Successorem. Ostendit novum Testamentum praestantius esse Veteri, inductâ comparatione de Sacerdotibus: quod illud quidem homines habuit Sacerdotes: hoc autem Christum. who like∣wise maketh the excellencie of the New Testament, in com∣parison of the Old, to consist in this, that they had many Priests successively, for that (by reason of Mortality) they were but men: in the New Testament, wee have Christ a Priest. So hee. This one Observation might satisfie any reasona∣ble man, for the confutation of your Romish Doctrine of Proper Priesthood; the rather because you were never able to prove, out of any Father, that Distinction of yours, to wit, of one being the Vicar, albeit the Successor of Christ. No, no this Distinction, now after a thousand yeares since Christ his Incarnation, hath beene the adulterate Coyne of your owne Romish forge. {fleur-de-lys} Seventhly, not Personall Sanctity,Heb. 7. 26. Holy, impolluted, and separated from sinnes. For whosoever, being meerely Man, shall arrogate to himselfe to be without sinne, the holy Ghost will give him the1. Iohn 1. 8. Lie. As for your Popes, wee wish you to make choice of whatsoever Historians you please, and wee
doubt not but you shall finde upon record, that many of them are noted to have beene as impious and mischievous in their lives, and in their deaths as infamous and cursed, as they were contrarily Bonifaces, Innocents, or Benedicts in their names. Can there be then any Analogie betweene your High Romane Priest and Christ, the Prototype to Melchisedech, in so mani∣fold Repugnancies? yet notwithstanding, every one of you must be (forsooth) a Priest after the order of Melchisedech. Nay, but (not to multiply many words) the Novelty of your Pretence doth bewray it selfe fromLambard. de Ordinat. Presb.

Peter Lombard, Master of the Romish Schoole, who Anno 1145. taught (how truly looke you to that) that every Priest at his Ordination, in taking the Chalice with Wine, and Platter with the Hoast, should understand that his power of Sacrificing was from the order of Aaron. Nor may you thinke that this was his private opinion, for Hee (saith yourPet. Lom∣bardus collegit sen∣tentias Theologo∣orum, & Magister Theologotum scho∣lasticorum dici me∣ruit. Lib. de Script. Eccles. Tit. Petrus Lombardus. Cardinall of him) collected the Sentences of Divines, and deserved to be called the Master of Schoolemen. Thus farre of the Person of Christ, as Priest; in the next place wee are to enquire into his Priestly Function. Of the Function of Christ his Priesthood, now after his Ascension into Heaven; and your Cardinall his Doctrine Sacri∣legiously detracting from it. SECT. VII. BY the Doctrine of your Cardinall, in the name of your Church,Bellar. Cru∣cis Sacrificium non est perpetuum, sed effectum ejus—nec dicitur aeternū quod non jugiter sacrifica∣tur—non in cae∣lis jam Sacerdos per solam orationē, nec mediante oblatione Victimae, quià tun. necesse est eum sem∣per offerre:—Ergo Eucharistia & Sacri∣ficium quod jugiter offertur—Ob∣latio in coelis non est propriè dictum Sacri∣ficium—Ergò non est verè ac pro∣priè.

And, Per Ministros suos perpetuò sacri∣ficat seipsum in Eucharistia: hoc enim solummodo perpetuum habet Sacerdotium. Bellar. ibid. cap. eod. ad finem. The old Priesthood of Aaron was translated in∣to the Priesthood of Christ: Every Priest (saith the Apostle) must have something to offer, else hee were no Priest. Thus his Priest∣hood is called Eternall, and must have a perpetuall offering, which was not that upon the Crosse. Nor can that suffice, which the Pro∣testants say, That his Priesthood is perpetuall, because of the per∣petuall virtue of his Sacrifice upon the Crosse; or bicause of his perpetuall Act of Intercession, as Priest in Heaven; or of presen∣ting his passion to his Father in Heaven, whither his Priesthood was translated. No, but it is certaine that Christ cannot now pro∣perly sacrifice by himselfe, Hee doth it by his Ministers in the Eu∣charist, Because the Sacrifice of the Crosse, in respect of Christians, is now invisible, and seene onely by Faith: which although it be a more true Sacrifice, yet it is not, as our Adversaries say, the only Sacrifice of Christian Religion, nor sufficient for the Conservation thereof. And againe, His sacrificing of himselfe in the Sacra∣ment, by his Ministers, is that by which onely hee is said to have
a perpetuall Priesthood. Accordingly your CardinallAlan. Chri∣stus in  coelo  aliquid Sacerdotal facit. nisi respectu nostri Sacramenti, quod ipse per nostrū ministerium efficit continuò & offert. Lib. 2.  Euchar. ca. 8 §. Reliqua. Alan; Christ (saith hee) performeth no Priestly Function in Heaven, but with relation to our Ministery here on earth, whereby hee offereth. So they, for the dignifying of their Romish Masse, as did also Rhemists. Christ his Priest∣hood consisteth in the perpetuall offring of Christ his Body and Blood in the Church. Annot. in Heb. 7. 17. your Rhemists; but with what Ecclipse of Iudgement and good Conscience, is now to be declared. If wee take the Sacrifice of Christ for the proper Act of Sa∣crificing, which is destructive; so was Christ his Sacrifice but One, and Once, Heb. 7. and 8. But understanding it as the sub∣ject matter of the same Sacrifice, once so offered to God upon the Crosse, and after his Ascension entred into Heaven, and so is it a perpetuall Sacrifice presentative before God. For as the High-Priest of the Law, after the Sacrifice was killed, entred into the Holy place once a yeare, but not without Blood, Heb. 9. 7. so Christ having purchased an eternall redemption, by his Death upon the Crosse, went into the Holy place (of Heaven) with the same his owne Blood.

Whence issueth our bold∣nesse and all-confidence, alwayes to addresse our prayers to him, or by him unto God: Wee having an High-Priest over the house of God, let us draw nere with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinckled from an evill Conscience.

Hee pro∣ceedeth. No man (saith hee) will deny this Position (namely) that Christ now ever exerciseth the office of a Priest, by presenting himselfe for us. So hee. Another Theologicall Professour, of Bellarmines owne Society, in the place where hee noteth Bellarmine to walke in his owne opinion alone, procedeth further,Vasquez. Ies. in 3. Thom Disp. 225. c. 2.

that Christ needeth not a Sacrifice to continue to the ends of the world, to the intent hee should become a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech; because hee is to continue a Priest for ever, even after the end of the world, when hee shall not have any proper Sacrifice at all. Yet lest this Iesuite might seeme but to lispe it, by mentioning an Eternity of the Priesthood of Christ, onely in respect of his person, your Iesuite Estius cometh off roundly,Estius Ies. Com. in Heb. cap. 7. vers. 17. Ex quibus omnibus intelligitur, Christum vocari Sa∣cerdotem in Aeter∣num ratione Perso∣nae, ratione Officij, & ratione Effectus. Personae quidem ra∣tione, quoniam nul∣lus ei Successurus. Officij ratione, quià semper in coelis in∣terpellat pro nobis, quod est Sacerdotis Officium. Nec ca∣ret hoc Sacrificium sua oblatione, qulà seipsum hominem, & vulnerum signa, quae passus est, exhibet, & offert Patri pro salu∣te Electorum. De∣nique ratione Effe∣ctus, quià per Sacri∣ficium pro nobis ob∣latum factus est no∣bis Causa redempti∣onis & salutis aeter∣nae. confessing a Priesthood of Christ both in Person, Office, and Effect, from the Con∣currence of the Text, as followeth. From all these wee may understand (saith he) that Christ is called a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedech, First in respect of his Person, because there is none to succede him. Secondly in respect of his Office, by making supplication in heaven for us. Nor doth hee want an Oblation, which is the presenting of his Body that suffered to the Father for our Salvation. And thirdly in respect of the Effect, being made for us, by his Sacrifice of the Crosse, the cause of our Redemption. So hee, as just Protestantiall as can be. {fleur-de-lys} This is still Christs Function of Priesthood, whereunto this Apostle exhorteth all Christians, at all times of need, to make their addresse; which Saint Iohn propoundeth as the onely Anchor-hold of Faith in his Propitiation, 1. Iohn 2. If any sinne, wee have an Advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous, and hee is (what?) The Propitiation for our sinnes. The which every faithfull Christian doth apply, by faith, unto himselfe, as often as hee prayeth to God, in Christs name, for the remission of sinnes, saying, Through Iesus Christ our Lord. How therefore can this his Function of Priesthood, with∣out extreme sacrilege, be held Insufficient to his Church, for obtaining pardon immediatly from God, who seeth not? As for other your ordinary Objections, taken from two sentences of the Apostle, speaking of the Examples of things celestiall, and of Purging sinnes now with better Sacrifices, you should not have troubled us with them, knowing them to be satisfyed by your owne AuthorsRibera Ies.

That the former Romish Sacrilegious Derogation, from Christs Priestly Function in Heaven, is contradicted by an∣cient Fathers; first in respect of Place, or Altar, and Function. SECT. VIII. THeodoret isTheod. in Psal. 109. Sacerdos nunc est Christus, non ip∣se aliquid offerens, sed vocatur Caput Offerentium, quan∣doquidèm corpus su∣um Ecclesiam voca. Objected by Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. alleged by you, as denying that Christ now offereth any thing by himselfe, but onely in the Church: albeit hee saith not so, simply; but, that hee offereth not in the Church personally, which all confesse: for otherwise The∣odoret presently afterHis words im∣mediately following are these: Et prop∣terea Sacerdotio fu∣gitur ut homo: reci∣pit autem ea quae of∣feruntur ut Deus. Offert autem Eccle∣sia Corporis & ejus sanguinis symbola. So Theod. expresseth, that Christ exerciseth his Priesthood still as man. As for the Church, his words are not, that Shee offereth the Body and Blood of Christ in Sacrifice, but, The Symbols of his Body and Blood: Therfore is this his Testimony unworthily and unconscionably objected. But wee will con∣sult with the direct speeches of Antiquity. First if you aske the Offering, Ambrose answereth you, thatAmbros. Nunc Christus offertur, hî in Imagine, ibi in ve∣ritate, ubi apud Pa∣trem Advocatus pro Nobis. Lib. 1 de offic. cap. 48. sub finem. The offering of Christ here below is but in an image: but his offering with the Father is in truth. If of the Priest, Augustine telleth you, Aug. in Psal. 94. Imponimus in a∣a Sacrificium, quan∣do Deum laudamus at verò Sacerdotem si requiras, super coelos est, inter pellat pro te, qui in terris mor∣tuus est pro te. The Priest is to be sought for in heaven, even Hee, who on earth suffered Death for thee. There is some difference then sure. As little reason have your Disputers to object that one and onely Testimony of Augustine,Aug. lib. 20. de Civit. cap. 10. Epis∣copi & Presbyteri (inquit) sunt propriè Sacerdotes. Bellarm. obijcit. lib. 1. de Missa, cap 17. Sed erunt omnes Sacerdotes Dei & Christi, & regnabunt cum eo mille annis. Apoc. 20. Non utique de solis Episcopis & Presbyteris dictum, qui propriè jam Vocantur Sacerdotes: sed sicut omnes Christianos dicimus, propter mysticum Chrisma: sic omnes Sacerdotes, quoniam membra sunt unius illius Sacerdotis. Presbyteri propriè Sacer∣dotes: which hee spake not absolutely, but comparatively (namely) in respect of Lay-Christians, who in Scripture are otherwise called Priests. (As your owneDuplex Sacerdotium, alterum Inte∣rius, omnium fidelium, qui aquâ salutari abluti sunt, Apoc. 1. 16.—alterum Exterius tantùm eorum, qui externo Sacramento ordinis ad aliquod proprium sacrumque ministerium ascribuntur. Catechis. Rom. par. 2. de Ordine, num. 22. Bellarmine, and Ro∣mane Catechisme distinguish, calling the former the Inward, which onely the Faithfull have by the Sacrament of Baptisme; the other Outward, by the Sacrament of Orders.) And with the like liberty doth Saint Augustine call the Sacrifice of the Old Testament (although most proper) but a Signe, in respect of the Spirituall Sacrifice of this worke of mercie; which heeAug. ibid. in Apoc. 20. 6. [Sed erunt Sacerdotes Christi, & regnabunt cum Eo, &c.] Non utique de solis Episcopis aut Presbyteris dictum est, qui propriê jam vocantur in Ecclesia Sacerdo∣tes: sed sicut omnes Christianos dicimus propter mysticum Chrisma, sic omnes Sacerdotes, quià membra unius Sacerdotis, &c. [For there is a double Reason of naming Christians Priests; one is in generall, because of their offering up spirituall Sacrifices of prayers and Praises to God, 1 Pet. 2. 5. And another is in speciall, by publike Fun∣ction, commending the same spirituall Sacrifices, in publike Service, in the name of the Church.  And so, according to the same libertie of terming them properly Priests, wherewith before (as you have heard) in comparing Almes with the Iewish Sacrifice, he called Almes the true Sacrifice, and the other but The signe of it; notwithstanding the bodily Sacrifice of the Iewes was, in proprietie of Speech, The true Sacrifice, and the other but Analogicall.] calleth True, namely in the Truth of Excellencie, al∣though
though not of Propriety, as you may see. And lastly, here you have urged one, than whom there is scarcely found among Protestants a greater Adversary to your fundamentall Article of your Sacrifice, which is the Corporall existence of Christ in the Eucharist. All which notwithstanding, the dignity of our Evangelicall Function is nothing lessened, but much more amplifyed by this Comparison. If furthermore wee speake of the Altar, you will have it to be rather on earth below, and to that end you object that Scripture, Hebr. 13. 10. Wee have [] that is, an Altar (saith the Apostle) whereof they have no right to eat, that serve at the Tabernacle. ThisRhemists in their Annot. upon the Place: and M.

I∣stud altare vel est crux Christi, in quâ Christus immolatus est, vel ipse Christus in quo, & per quem prèces nostras offe∣rimus: & hoc est Altare aureum, de quo Apoc. 8. Com. in hunc locum. Aquinas, expounding the place to signifie Either his Altar upon the Crosse, or else his Body, as his Altar in Heaven: mentioned Apocal. 8. and called The golden Altar. If wee our selves should tell you, how some one affirmeth that This Altar, spoken of by the Apostle, is the Body of Christ himselfe in Heaven, upon which, and by which all Christians are to offer up their spirituall Sacrifices of Faith, Devotion, Thankefulnesse, Hope, and Charity; you would pre∣sently answer, that This one certainely is some Lutheran or Calvinist, the words are so contradictory to your Romish Garbe: notwithstanding you may finde all this in theAntididag. Coloniens. de Missae Sacrificio. §. Post∣hac—[Habemùs Altare] Heb. 13. & Apoc. 8.

Cardinall was content to leave it behinde him, because Many Catholikes (saith hee) in∣terpret it otherwise. {fleur-de-lys} And, indeed, who is of so shallow a braine, as not to discerne the notorious unconscionablenesse of your Dispu∣ters; who confessing that the Apostles, in their times, did See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 15. Abstaine from the words Sacrifice, Priest, and Altar, do notwithstanding allege the word, Altar, in the Text to the Hebrewes, for proofe of a proper Altar in the Masse? Will you be contented to permit the decision of this point to the judgement of your Iesuite Estius?Estius Comment. in 13. ad Hebr. [Habemus Altate.] Thomas Altare hoc interpretatur Crucem Christi, vel ipsum Christum, de quo edere, inquit, est fructum passionis percipere, & ipsi tanquam Capiti incorpocari. Crucem Christi pro∣prie vocari Altare nulla dubitatio est. Vnde Ecclesia vocat Aram Crucis—Arbitror Expositionem Thomae magis esse germanam, quam innuit Apostolous, cum paulo post dicit [Iesum extra portam passum esse,] i.e. in ara Crucis oblatum. Vt taceam, quod toties in hac Epistola, atque ex instituto per Antithesim comparat Sacerdotem ministrantem Tabernaculo, cum Christo seipsum offerente in Cruce.—Sanè cum nullam facere voluerit mentionem Sacrificij incruenti novae legis, non multum verisimile est, eum nunc ali∣ud agentem, velut ex abrupto voluisse de Sacrificio incruento sermonem jungere; Sed potius cruenti in cruce oblati memoriam ex antedictis renovare.—Huc pertinet quod Corpus Christi in Cruce oblatum, Pa∣nis vocatur, fide manducandus. Vt Ioh. 6. Pans quem ego dabo. Hee adhereth to the Interpretation of Aquinas, which is, that here, by Al∣tar,
is meant the Crosse of Christs sufferings: which hee collecteth out of the Text of the Apostle, where hee saith of the Oblation of Christs Passion, that It was without the gate; and observeth, for Confirmation-sake, that the Apo∣stle often, of purpose, opposeth the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse to the Bloody Sacrifice of the Old Testament, so farre, as never to make mention of the Sacrifice of the New Testa∣ment. So hee. What is, if this be not our Protestantiall profession, concerning this word, Altar, to prove it to be ta∣ken Improperly for the Altar of Christs Crosse; and not for your pretended proper Altar of the Masse? {fleur-de-lys} But wee are cited to consult with the Ancient Fathers, be it so. If then wee shall demand where our High-Priest Christ Iesus is, to whom a man in Fasting must repaire,Origen. I∣junans debes adire Pontificem tu Christum, qul utique non in terris quaeren∣dus est, sed in coelis: Et per ipsum debes offerre Hostiam Deo. In Levit. Cap. 16. Homil. 10. Origen re∣solveth us, saying, Hee is not to be sought here on earth at all, but in Heaven. If a Bishop be so utterly hindred by persecution, that hee cannot partake of any Sacramentall Altar on earth, Gregory Nazianzen will fortifie him, as hee did himselfe, say∣ing, Gregor. Na∣zianzen. Si ab his Al∣taribus me arcebunt, at aliud habeo, cu∣jus figurae sunt ea, quae nec oculis cer∣mmus, super quod nec ascia, nec manus ascendat, nec ullum Artificum instrumē∣tum auditum est: sed mentis totum hoc opus est, huic∣que per contempla∣tionem astabo, in hoc gratū immolabo Sa∣crificiū, oblationes & Holocausta, [] tantò praestantiora, quantò Veritas um∣brâ. Orat. 28. pag. 44. I have another Altar in Heaven, whereof these (Al∣tars) are but Signes; a better Altar, to be beholden with the eyes of my mind, there will I offer up my Oblations: as great a Dif∣ference (doubtlesse) as betweene Signes and Things. This could not hee have sayd of those Altars, if the Sacrifices on them both were, as you pretend, subjectively and corpo∣rally the same. If wee would know how, what, and where the thing is, which a Christian man ought to contēplate upon, when hee is exercised in this our Eucharisticall Sacrifice?Chrysostom. in 1. Cor. 10. Hom. 24. Illud sanè tre∣mendum Sacrifici∣um, ut cum concordia ad illud accedamus, ut Aquilae facti ad ipsum coelum evolemus: ubi enim cadaver, ibi aquilae. Cadaver Domini corpus, propter mortem: Aquilas autem non oportet ad inseriora trahi aut repere, sed ad superiora volare, & Solem Iustitiae intueri oculo mentis acutissimo. Aquilarum enim haec mensa est, non Graculorum. Chry∣sostome is ready to instruct him, Not to play the Chough or Iay, in fixing his thoughts here below, but as the Eagle to ascend thither where the Body is, namely (for so hee saith) in Heaven. Accor∣ding to that of the Apostle, Heb. 10. Christ sitting at the right hand of God. Vers. 12. What therefore? Therefore let us draw neere with an Assurance of faith. Vers. 22. If wee would understand wherein the difference of the Iew∣ish Religion and Christian Profession especially consisteth, in respect of Priesthood,Aug. advers. Iudaeos, ca. 9. Nam & Aaron & Sacerdotium jam nullum est in aliquo tem∣plo, & Christi Sacerdotium est aeternum in coelo. Augustine telleth us that They have no Priesthood; and the Priesthood of Christ is eternall in Heaven. And the holy Fathers give us some Reasons for these and the like Resolutions. For if any would know the Reason why wee must have our Confidence in the Celestiall Priest, Sacrifice, and Altar;Oecumen. in Heb. 10. super haec verba, [Cum certitu∣dine idei.] Cum deinceps nihil visible supersit, ne{que} Templum, hoc est coelum; ne{que} Pontifex, id est, Christus; ne{que} Hostia, quae Corpus illius est, fido deinceps opus est. Oecumenius andAmbros. in Heb. 10. Cum iducio, nit Aposto∣lus: nihil enim hic visible, neque Sacerdos, neque Sacrificium, neque Altare. Ambrose will shew us
that it is because Here below there is nothing visible; neither Temple, ours being in Heaven; nor Priest, ours being Christ; nor Sacrifice, ours being his Body; nor yet Altar, saith the other. Heare your owne Canus:Canus loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. Oblatio, quam Chri∣stus in coelis incruen∣tum fecit. pag. 421. Christs offereth an unbloody Oblation in Heaven. {fleur-de-lys} Chrysostome will not be behind his disciple Oecumenius, in expressions, who differenceth our Christian Religion from the Iewish, for thatChrysost. in Hebr. Hom. 11. in Moral. Quantum est inter Aaron & Chri∣stum, tantum est in∣ter Iudaeos & nos: quippe nos habemus Sacrarium in Coelis, Sacerdotem in coe∣lis, & hostiam, &c. Talia igitur nos of∣feramus Sacrificia, quae in illo Sanctuario possunt offerri. And then explaining what they were, viz. Sacrifi∣cium laudis, justitiae, Spiritus contribulati; haec sacrificia offeramus. Our Sanctuary, Priest, and Sa∣crifices is in Heaven. And if Christians intend any other Sacri∣fice than that, hee admonisheth that they may be such, which may be accepted of in the Heavenly Sanctuarie; as namely The Sacrifice of Iustice, Praise, and of a Contrite Spirit, and the like, all meerely Spirituall (as you confesse) and there∣fore but Metaphorically called Sacrifices: AndHierom. in Epist. ad Hebdeb. quaest. 2. Ascendamus igitur cum Domino coenaculum magnum stratum, & accipiamus ab eo sursum Calicem novi Testamenti, ibique cum eo Pascha celebremus, inebriantes inebriemur ab eo Vino Sobrietatis. Saint Hierome, also inviteth us To Celebrate our Passeover with him above. {fleur-de-lys} Thus in respect of the place of Residence of Christ our High-Priest, and his Function, which hath beene already confirmed by the Fathers of the first Councell of Nice. And thus farre of the place of this Altar, the Throne of Grace; some∣thing would be spoken in respect of Time. That the former Sacrilegious Derogation, from Christs Priestly Function in Heaven, is contradicted by Scriptures, and Fathers, in respect of the Time of the execution thereof. SECT. IX. CHrist his Bodily existence in Heaven (as wee haveSee above Chap. 3. Sect. 9. heard) is set out by the Apostle in these termes: Hee abideth a Priest for us. Hee continueth a Priest. Hee having a continuall Priesthood. Hee, without intermission, appeareth before God for us. Thus the Apostle. But what of this, will you say? Do but marke. Are you not All heard still proclaiming, as with one voice, that your Romish Sacrifice of the Masse is the onely , andBarradas. Quod singulis diebus Christus offert in∣currentè.

Morning and Evening, should be a figure of your Masse-Sacri∣fice, which is but onely offered in the Morning. As if you would make a picture, having two hands, for to represent a person that hath but one. But, not to deny that the Celebration of the Eucharist may be called a Iuge Sacrificium (for so some Fathers have termed it:) Yet, they no otherwise call it Iuge, or Continual, than they call it a Sacrifice, that is, Vnproperly; because it cannot possibly be compared for Continuance of Time to that Celestiall of Christ in the highest Heaven, where Christ offereth himselfe to God for us day and night, without Intermission. Whereupon it is that Irenaeus exhorteth men to pray often by Christ at his Altar,Irenaeus. Nos quoque victimas of∣ferre ad altare fre∣quenter.

[That is objectively; for it is the Bloo∣dy Body, that is presented by us in the Eucharist.] Christ exhibi∣teth his Body wounded upon the Crosse, and slaine, as a [Iuge Sa∣crificium] that is, a Continuall Sacrifice, perpetually unto his Father for us. And to this purpose serve the fore-cited Testi∣monies of Augustine, Gregory Nazianzen, Ambrose, Chryso∣stome, and Occumenius; some pointing out the Altar in Hea∣ven, as the Truth; some by Exhortations, and some by their Examples instructing us to make our Continuall Approach unto the Celestiall Altar. CHALLENGE. NOw you, who so fixe the hearts and minds of the Specta∣tors of your Masse upon your sublunary Altars and Hoasts, and appropriate the Iuge Sacrificium thereunto (in re∣spect of Time) during onely the houres of your Priestly Sacri∣ficing; allow your attention but a moment of Time, and you will easily see the Impiety of that your Profession. The Iuge Sacrificium of Christ, as it is presented to God by him in Heaven, hath beene described to be Continuall, without Intermission, Alwayes (that is) without any Interruption of any moment of Time: to the end that all sorts of Penitents and faithfull Suters, solliciting God by him, might finde (as the Apostle saith) , that is, Helpe at any time of need. The Gates of this Temple, Heaven, being ever open; the mat∣ter of this Sacrifice, which is the Body of Christ, being there ever present; The Priest, who is Christ himselfe, ever exe∣cuting his Function. Whereas, contrarily, you will confesse,
(wee dare say) that the Doores of your Churches may happen to be all locked, or interdicted; your Sacrifice shut up in a Boxe, or lurched, and carryed away by Mice; your Priest taken up with sport, or repast, or journey, or sleepe: yea, and even when hee is acting a Sacrifice, may possibly nullifie all his Priestly Sacrificing Act, by reason of (See hereafter Book 7. Cha. 5. Sect. 5. Confessed) Almost infinite Defects. Therefore the Sacrilegiousnesse of the Doctrine of your Masse is thus farre manifested, in as much that your owne Ministeriall Priesthood doth so prejudice the personall Priest∣hood of Christ, as it is in Heaven, as the Moone doth by her interposition ecclipse the glory of the Sunne: by confoun∣ding things distinct, that is, (as wee haveIn the two former Sections. learned from the Fathers) Image with Truth; The state of Wicked Parta∣kers with the Godly; Matters Visible with Invisible; Signes with Things; Worse with Better; Iayes with Eagles, and the like. A SECOND CHALLENGE, {fleur-de-lys} Against your Cardinall Bellarmine his principall Grounds; out of the Confession of your owne Iesuit, both from Scriptures, and from ancient Fathers. CHrist (saith the Apostle) is a Priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech. This [for ever] your Cardi∣nall Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, Cap. 6. Quod si Sacerdo∣tium Christi durat usque ad consum∣mationem mundi (id enim Scriptura aeter∣num vocat) certè Sa∣crificij ritus durate debet—at Sa∣crificium Crucis se∣mel tantùm peractū est, nec repeti potest, ergò aliud esse debet quod jugiter offera∣tur. Et post aliquot paginas Quod ad ae∣ternum Christi Sa∣cerdotium attinet, necesse est ut saepius offerat, vel per se, vel per Ministros, vel per Ministros, non quidem cruentè, sed aliquo alio mo∣do. Idem Paulus do∣cet, cum dicit: Om∣nis Pontifex ad of∣ferendū hostias con∣stituitur—nec dicitur aeternum Sacerdotium, quod non jugiter Sacrificatur: nec sufficit aeternum quoad effe∣ctum. So he, [His other Reasons have been alleged in the former Sections.] Bellarmine restraineth to the time of Mortality, on∣ly to the end of the world, and that Christs Priesthood can have no further Extent; concluding thereupon, that (for the preserving of the Priesthood of Christ) Hee, either by him∣selfe, or by some other, must necessarily offer some sacrifice unto the end of the world, because it cannot bee that that, which was but once done, can ever againe bee repeated, namely, his bloody Sacrifice upon the Crosse. So hee, Concluding it must there∣fore bee the unbloudy Sacrifice in your Romish Masse. Although this Argument deserve no other Confutation, than what hath been given out of the Confessions of your own Iesuit. Yet because another of the same Society, and of singular estimation in your Church, namely Vasquez (who often expresseth his reading of the works of Bellarmine) may seeme as it were to offer his service unto us, as being desi∣rous to oppose against the Iudgement of your Cardinall, wee may not deny him our due Attention. He both out of Scriptures and ancient Fathers (alleged in the Margin) con∣cludeth.

Disp. 86. Ex Patribus, quos nos contra Haere∣ticos supra adduximus, nullus est qui asserat, ex eo solum dici Christum Sacerdotem secundùm ordinem Mechil∣sedech, quòd in coena Sacrificium Corporis sub speciebus Panis & Vini obulit.—Num. 38. Si attente con∣sideremus modum loquendi Scripturae, nunquam inveniemus dictum Sacrificium Christi, vel secundùm ordi∣nem Melchisedech, vel secundùm ordinem Aaron, quod sit in perpetuum Sacerdos—qui una oblatione con∣summavit, &c. that Christ is called a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech, not in respect onely of the time, to the end of the world, but everlastingly beyond all worlds: and this not onely in respect of any Sacrifice to bee made heereafter, but of that his Bloody Sacrifice once and onely offered upon the Crosse. Professing, that the contrary Assertion is repugnant to Scrip∣ture, even By the Exposition of ancient Fathers, expresly teach∣ing, that Christ's Priesthood is called Eternall, because it reach∣eth beyond all mortalitie. And your Cardinall objected that out of Hebr. 5. Every Priest must have something to offer: Ergo, Christ, being a Priest, must not bee without a present and continuall Sacrifice, which can bee no other than that in the Eucharist. Against which the same Jesuit replyeth; But all the Greeke Fathers upon this Text (saith hee) and some of the Latine Fathers also, interpret this not of the unbloody, but of the bloody Sacrifice of Christ: which may bee sufficient for his eternall Priesthood, by reason of the unitie of his Humanitie and Divinitie, which is eternall. Nor is there any one (saith hee) of all the Fathers, whom wee have cited in Confutation of Heretikes, that expound that Scripture to exclude the Sacrifice of the Crosse. So hee, and much more, in the place quoted against the particular and petty Reasons objected to the contrarie. What Confutation can be more convincent then that, which is warranted and fortified by the confessed Evidences of Scriptures, and Testi∣monies of Ancient Fathers? {fleur-de-lys}
Of the second Typicall Scripture, which is the Passeover: shewing the weaknesse of the Argument taken from thence, for proofe of a proper Sacrifice in the Masse. SECT. X. FIrst, it is meet wee heare your Objector speake, even your Bellarm. Im∣molatio Agni Pas∣chalis potest quidem dici figura Passionis: nam si Agnus ille fu∣it figura Eucharistiae, Eucharistia autem fi∣gura Passionis, quis negat Agnum istum figuram fuisse & Re∣praesentationem Pas∣sionis?

Cardinall, who albeit hee confesseth the Paschall Lambe to have been the figure of Christ on the Crosse, yet did it in the Ceremonies thereof (saith hee) more immediatly and principally prefigure the Eucharist than the Passion, which is proved by Scrip∣ture, 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passeover is offered up, therefore let us feast it in the Azymes of Syncerity and Truth.] Which offering up was not fulfilled on the Crosse; but it is evident that the Apostle did eat this true Paschall Lambe, the flesh of Christ, at his Supper: and this A∣postle exhorteth us to this Feast, in saying, [Let us therefore keepe our Feast, &c.] So hee, bestowing a large Chapter of Argu∣ments, wherewith to bleare our eyes, lest that wee should see in this Scripture [Our Passeover is offered up] Rather the Immola∣tion of Christ on the Crosse, than in the Eucharist. We willing∣ly yeeld unto his alleged Testimonies of ancient Fathers, who by way of Allusion, or Analogie, do all call the Eucharist a Paschal Sacrifice. But yet that the words of this Scripture should more properly and principally meane the Eucharisticall Sacrifice (as if the Jewish Passeover did rather prefigure the Sacrifice of Christ in the Masse, than on the Crosse) not one. It were a tedious worke to sift out all the drosse of his Argu∣mentations; Neverthelesse, because he putteth Protestants unto it, saying as followeth,Bellar. quo supr §. Dicent &c. Dicent Adversarij Apostolum loqui de Immolatione in cruce facta: at nos probabimus iguram illam propriè impletam fuisse in coena. But our Adversaries (saith hee) will say, that the Apostle, in saying our Passeover is offered up, speaketh of Christ's Sacrifice offered upon the Crosse: but wee will prove that this figure was properly fulfilled at his Supper. (So he.) Wee will now shew you, that other Adversaries, than Protestants, are rea∣dy to encounter this your Champion. First, the choisest Chieftaine of his owne side, armed with the Authoritie of Christ himselfe▪ Joh. 13. 1. [Before the day of the Passeover, Iesus knowing that his hower was come, that he must passe out of the world unto the Father.] Now when was this spo∣ken? Even then, saithIoh. 13. 1. [Antè diem Paschae sciens Iesus quia venit hora, ut transiret ex hoc mundo ad Patrem.] Hic mortem Transitum vocat.—Allu∣dit ad Pascha, ac si Latinè disceret, Antè diem festum Transitûs, sciens quia venit hora ut transiret ipse: Ipse enim Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus.—Optimus autem terminus, Transitus ejus ex hoc mundo ad Patrem. Tolet. Ies. Com. in cum locum. Tolet your Cardinall & Jesuit, When he came to the celebrating of the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, that is, at his last Supper. But what was meant hereby? namely, Christ
alluded unto the Iewish Passeover (saith hee) in signification of his owne passing over by death to his Father. So he. So also your Je∣suit August. in Psalm. 68. Cum Ve∣nit Dominus ad Sa∣cranientum Sangoi∣nis & Corporis sui,  venit, ut  ad Patrem dmundo.] Qbus vebis express  Paschae. Teste∣prerio Ies. in Exod. cap. 12 Disp. 8. Pererius, out of Augustine. Secondarily, to the Scripture objected, 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passe∣over is offered up, Christ▪] that is, As the figurative paschall Lambe was offered up for the deliverance of the people of Israel out of Egypt, so Christ was offered up to death for the Redemption of his people, and so passed by his passion to his Father. So your1. Cor. 6. Pascha nostrum im∣molatus est Chri∣stus, orgò epulemur Azymis , & veritatis!

Cardinall himselfe con∣fesseth to relate onely to Christ's Sacrifice on the Crosse; and notwithstanding dare immediatly oppose, saying, Neverthe∣lesse the Ceremony of the Paschall Lambe did more immediatly and properly prefigure the Eucharist than Christ's passion: where∣in, whether he will or no, he must be an Adversary to himselfe. For there is no Ceremony more principall in any Sacrifice than are these two, viz. The matter of Sacrifice, and the Sacrificing Act thereof. Now the matter of the Sacrifice was a Lambe, the Sacrificing Act was the killing thereof, and offering it up killed unto God. Whether therefore the Paschall Lambe did more principally prefigure the visible Body of Christ on the Crosse, or your imagined Invisible in your Masse, whether the slaine Pas∣chall Lambe bleeding to death, did more properly and immediat∣ly prefigure and represent a living and perfect Body of Christ, than that his Body wounded to death, and blood-shed, Com∣mon sense may stand for Judge. The Ancient Fathers, when they speake of the Sacrifice of Christ's passion, in a precise proprietie of speech, do declare themselves accordingly. If in generall, then asOrigen Sacrificium, pro quo haec omnia Sacrificia in typo & figura praecesserunt, unum & perfectum immolatus est Christus. Hujus Sacrificij carnem quisquis tetigerit, sanctificabitur. In Levit. cap. 6. Hom. 4. Origen: All those other Sacrifices (saith hee) were perfigurations of this our perfect Sacrifice. If more particularly, then asChrysostomus de  & Latrone 1. Cor. 5. Pascha ostrum immolatus est Christus: se∣stivitas ergò, &c. Vide crucis intuitu porceptam laetitiam? in cruce enim immolatus est Christus: Vbi immo∣latiòtiò,  peccatorum; ubi ampucatio peccatorum, reconciliatio Domini—novum Sacrificium—nam ipse Sacrificium erat, & Sacerdos; Sacrificium secundùm carnem, Sacerdos secundùm Spiritum, offerebat secundùm Spiritum, offerebtur secundùm carnem—& Altare Crux fuit. Chrysost. Tom. 3. pag. 826. Chrysostome, from the objected Text of the Apostle. 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passe∣over is offered up, Christ, Let us therefore keepe our Feast, &c.] Dost thou see (saith hee) in beholding the Crosse, the joy which wee
have from it? for Christ is offered upon the Crosse, and where there is an Immolation, there is Reconciliation with God: this was a new Sacrifice, for in this the flesh of Christ was the thing sa∣crificed, his Spirit the Priest and Sacrificer, and the Crosse his Al∣tar.

Origen, calling the Sacrifice on the Crosse, the Onely true Passeover. Which saying his Reporter Socrates imbraceth, as a Divine Contemplation. {fleur-de-lys} That the third objected Typicall Scripture out of Exod. 24. [The Blood of the Testament] is not justly objected for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice in the Masse. SECT. XI. THis Text Exod. 24. speaking of the Sacrifice of the Old Testament [This is the Blood of the Testament] being so consonant to the words of Christ, delivered in his Institu∣tion of the Eucharist [This is the Blood of the New Testament] in the Gospell, seemeth to your Cardinall to be an Argu∣ment of great force, and therefore doth hee dart it against us with all his strength of Arguing, saying;Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 8. Ter∣rium nostrum Argu∣mentum sumitur ex Exod. 24. et Heb. Hic est sanguis Te∣stamenti, quod man∣davit ad vos Deus. De quo Marc. 14. Hic est sanguis Novi Testamenti—Sic ar∣gumētamur. Sanguis Testamenti veteris erat sanguis victimae jam immolate et ve∣rè sacrificatae, Exod. 24. Ergò sanguis no∣vi Testamenti apud Christum est sanguis victimae verè & pro∣priè sacrificatae: Est autem sanguis ille Christi, ut ipse dicit, Hic est sanguis me∣us, Ergo ipse fuit vi∣ctima in coena im∣molata et sacrificata. The Blood of the Old Testament was the Blood of an Hoast truly sacrifised; Therefore the Blood of the New Testament mentioned in the Eu∣charist (whereof the other was a figure) must needs be the Blood of Christ properly sacrifised therein. So hee, heaping up Reason upon Reason, as it were to make a mountaine; and presently after his much working and heaving, cometh one of his owne family of the Iesuites, Vasquez by name, and kicketh all downe with his heeles, as it had beene but a Mole-hill, saying;Vasquez. Ies. in 3. Tho. Disp. 190. num. 15. [Novum Testamentū in san∣guine meo] apud E∣vangelistas & Pau∣lum, in sanguine Christi, prout est in hoc sacramento, non convenit. Nam quā∣vis sacramentum Eu∣charistiae sit sacra∣mentum Novi Te∣stamenti, & hac ra∣tione dici posset No∣vi Testamenti—ta∣men longè alio sensu dicitur Novi Testa∣menti, aut Novum Testamentum, quòd sit confirmatio & consummatio Novi Testamenti, hoc est, gratiae, quam Chri∣stus promeruit generi humano; de quo Hebr. 9. [Testamentum in mortuis confirmatum est] hoc est morte Testatoris,—undè sequitur [neque vetus Testamentum sine sanguine dedicatur] iude colligit, Novum sanguine Christi confirmari—Et rursus, [ubi Testamentum ibi mors intercedat Testatoris necesse est] & tandem sic concludit Caput Apostolus: [sic Christus semel oblatus est, ad multorum exhaurienda pec∣cata] constat igitur sanguinem Testamenti dici eatenus, quatenus est effusus in confirmatione illius, sicut hac ratione sanguis hircorum & vitulorum essusus est. Exod. 24. [hic est sanguis Testamenti] nam sacrifi∣cium incruentum in Eucharistia non erat causa universalis Redemptionis—illud ergo [Effundetur in Re∣missionem peccatorum] significat futuram Effusionem in Passione. That it is called [The Blood of the New Testament] by Christ, not as it is in this Sacrament, but as it referreth to the Sacrifice of Christes Passion. Which hee confirmeth by the most Authenticall kinde of proofe, even from the Scripture, out of one Chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, in severall places. One from these words [A Te∣stament is confirmed in men dead.] The next, Heb. 9. [Where a Testament is, there doth necessarily intervene the death of the
Testator.] And againe; [Christ was once, sacrifised to take away the death of many.] He might have added a fourth vers. 15. Christ is the mediator of the New Testament, that death coming betweene, for Redemption. &c. Each one of these pointing out Christs Bloody Sacrifice on the Crosse, teacheth us to deale with you, by law of Retor∣tion thus: The Old Testament was confirmed by the Death and Blood-shed of the Creature sacrifised: And so (accor∣ding to the Apostles Comparison) was the New Testament confirmed by the Death and Blood-shed of Christ our Te∣stator. Therefore could not the Bloody Sacrifice of the Old Testament be a Figure of an Vn-bloody Sacrifice in the New. That your Cardinall Bellarmine hath Contradicted the Do∣ctrine of the Ancient Church of Rome, taught by Pope Leo the First. SECT. XII. POpe Leo is hee, whom the Church of Rome will be thought to esteeme as equall with the best of Popes, and therefore, hath honoured him with the singular Title of Magnus, (Ob insignem sanctitatem, doctrinam & eloquentiam, saith your IesuitPossevin. Appa∣rat. Tit. Leo. Possevin) who lived above a thousand yeares since. Him doth yourBellar Lib. 1. de Missa, Cap. 7. Leo Sermone 7. de Passi∣one Domini.

Cardinall object for proofe of the Sacrifice of the Masse, from the Signe of the Paschall Lambe, in a Sentence, which in it selfe is sufficient to tell us what was the Faith of the Church of Rome in his dayes; and to direct you in the point now in Question: in manifesting that your Cardinall hath egregiously abused his Testimony, for proofe of an Vn-bloody Sacrifice of Christs Body in the Eucharist; which Leo spake so evidently and expresly of the Sacrifice of his Passion, that your Iesuite Vasquez was enforced toLeo Papa de Passione Domini, Serm. 7.

Eadem ferè verba habt Chrysostomus in Psalm. 95. [Lest the word, [Sacrament] in the Sentence of Leo, may move any to conceive that it is spoken of the Eucharist, or yet of any other Sacrament of the Church of Rome, It is to bee observed, that nothing is more familiar with Leo, than to call every Mysterie and Christian Article, Sacramen∣tum. As for Example, in the beginning of this Sermon, hee calleth the Feast of Easter, Sacramentum Sa∣lutis. De Festo Nativitatis Serm. 2. Reparator nobis salutis nostrae annua revolutione Sacramentum. Et Serm. 16. De voce Christi, [Transeat Calix iste]—quod non sit exaudita, magna est Expo∣sitio Sacramenti.] confesse thus much, even then, when hee sought to defend the Romish Sacrifice of the Eucharist. The words of Leo are generall. All those things which were performed, concerning the Sacrificing of the Lambe by Moyses, from Gods command, were prophesied of Christ,
and did properly declare the Slaying of Christ. So hee. Ergo hee spake of  bloody Sacrifice. And if these Prefigu∣rations of the Old Law, in the Sacrifice of the Lambe, do properly point at the Bloody Sacrifice of Christ, then were they not properly Types of any Sacrifice in the Masse. And lest you might thinke that Leo was singular In this Opinion, your Iesuit will have you know that Chrysostome hath also the same words. Now whether you are bound rather to be∣lieve an Ancient Romane Pope, or a late Romane Cardinall; judge you. In the last place wee are to remove an Ob∣jection. An Objection taken from the Comparison between the figure of the Old Testament, and the thing figured in the New; ear∣nestly insisted upon, and as easily refuted. SECT. XIII. THe Briefe of your Reason is this.Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 3. [De fi∣guris veteris Testa∣menti.] Sumitur hoc Argumentum—Fi∣gurae necessario infe∣riores esse debent re∣bus figuraris—Sed veteris Testamenti Sacramenta, panis Melchisedech, panis Propositionū—Ag∣nus Paschalis, Man∣na, erant figurae Eu∣charistiae simplici pa∣ni aequales, vel prae∣stantiotes. Ergo Eu∣charistianon est sim∣plex panis, significans corpus Christi, sed et ipsum corpus Christi Majorem et Minorē probam ex Patribus. Figures are ne∣cessarily inferiour unto the Things prefigured. But, In the Old Testament, the Bread of Melchisedech, the Shew-bread, the Bread of Manna, and the Paschall Lambe were figures of the Eucharist in the New Testament; Therefore the matter in the Eucharist is not simply Bread, but the Body of Christ. Thus your Cardinall. Your Dr. Heskins also playeth his descant upon this Base, and runneth voluntary in a large discourse from theDr. Heskins in his parlam. lib. 3. chap. 14. Brazen Serpent on a Pole, the figure of Christ Crucified: From Ionas in the Belly of the Whale, a figure of Christ's Resurrection; and from the Paschall Lambe, a figure of Christ offered in the Eucharist. Now the Thing being better than the Signe, therefore Christ herein offered is better than the Lambe: But if (as the Sacramentaries say) the Eucharist be but a Signe, then was the Paschall Lambe but the figure of a Piece of Bread, wherewith there is no Similitude. But that the things prefigured are more excellent than their Signes, is proved out of the Epistle to the Hebrewes, in preferring the
New Testament before the Old. Whereby I may Conclude (saith hee) that the Paschall Lambe being a Signe of this Sacrament, this is not Bread, but the Body of Christ. So hee. The An∣swer is easie, by a Distinction of Things prefigured. Some are Figures Principall, which are called Arche-types, and some lesse principall, called onely Antitypes. We shall make the matter plaine by Authenticall Examples, 1. Cor. 10. 2. Wee are Baptized into Moses in the Cloud and in the Sea. Hence all Expositors (aswell as yourAquinas upon the same place. Aquinas) teach that The Sea, thorow which the Iraelites passed under Moses, was a Signe of Baptisme: by which Baptisme wee are buryed in∣to Christs death, Rom. 6. This Exposition standeth firme without any Contradiction. Whereby you may perceive, that the Archetypon, or thing Principally prefigured by that Sea, is Christ's buriall: and Water in Baptisme, is but as the Antitype, or thing lesse principally prefigured thereby. If then you shall compare the Type, or Figure, with the Thing prefigured, as Archetype, or Principall thing figured or prefigured, wee are bound by Christian verity to believe your Proposition to be most true, (to wit) Christ's buriall is infinitely more excellent than either the Type in the Old Testament, which was the Sea they passed thorow; or yet than Water in Baptisme in the New Testament, as the Anti∣type thereof. But if you compare the Type of the Old Te∣stament with the Antitype or figure of the New, then can nothing be more false than is this your generall Proposition, affirming that Figures and Signes are inferiour to the thing prefigured, as you may see in the Apostles Example. The Sea under Moses, a figure of Baptisme under Christ.Athanasius Interpret. Parabol. de Baptismo post quaest. 103. Tom. 2. Baptis∣ma secundum erat Mare rubrum. . For as the Sea was there (saith Athanasius) so is Water here. Yet was not the Element of Water in the Sea of lesse worth in Substance, than is the Element of Water in the Font of Baptisme; both having equally in them the Substantiall Properties of Water. Our next Example, in the same Chapter, is this: They (to wit, the Jewes) ate of the same spirituall meate, and dranke of the same spirituall drinke; (namely) Christ's Body and Blood; the one whereof was prefigured by Manna, the other by the Water out of the Rocke in the Old Testa∣ment. Even as the same Body of Christ is configured by Bread; and his Blood by Wine in the Eucharist, which is the Sacrament of the New Testament; as hath beene proved from Fathers, and Others, in a fullSee above B. 5. Chap. 2. Sect. 2. Section. And for this cause Gregorie Nazianzen,Greg. Na∣zian. Orat. 42. . I dare say (saith hee) that the Legall Passeover was a Figure of a figure; but somewhat more obscure. So hee. Which scarce any of your Doctors dare say, lest that the Eucharisticall Oblation should be
judged a Figure of Christ's Sacrifice, and not the Proper Sa∣crificing of Christ. Now then, Compare Manna and Bread with Christ's Body; and the Water of the Rocke, and Water of Baptisme, with his Blood, and your Consequence is most Di∣vine: viz. The Thing prefigured excelleth, beyond all Compa∣rison, the Signes thereof. But yet againe Compare the Signes and Antitypes, viz. Manna with Bread, and the Water of the Rocke with Wine in the Cup: and in their Natures and Sub∣stances, the one doth not exceed the other. You will then aske, If the Sacraments of both Testaments were in this maner joynt Antitypes, that is, Correspondent Signes of the same Body and Blood of Christ; wherein then consisteth the Excellencie of the Sacraments of the New, if it be not in respect of their naturall and substantiall proper∣ties? Wee were about to tell you, namely, that Although these former Sacraments of both Testaments be but Cor∣porall food, and drinke; yet have the Sacraments of the Gospell a threefold Privilege above the other. The First is in respect of the Efficacie of the Signification. Signes of the Old being Propheticall, and darkly promising Christ's Body and Blood to come. But, Signes of the New are Historicall, poynting out, unto life, Christ already come, and crucified in his Body, and his Blood shed. The Second, in respect of the Efficacie of Application, and Exhibition of both these, arising from the former Ground. For Saint Paul said more effectually, Christ, who dyed for mee, and gave himselfe for mee; than any Israelite under the Law could say, Christ, who shall dye for mee, and shall give himselfe for mee. The Third is the Excellencie of Duration, for those Signes as Shadowes, had an end long since: Whereas the Evangelicall Symbols, as Images, are to be perpetuall to the end of the world, as Saint Paul did intimate in his speech of the Eu∣charist, You shew the Lord's death untill his coming againe, 1 Cor. 11. Now then that you see what is, indeed, the Bet∣ternesse betweene the figure and thing figured, may you not say it had beene better that your Disputers had forborne their Objection? From Typicall Scriptures wee descend to Propheticall. {fleur-de-lys}

The whole Controversie is, whether this Scrip∣ture spake of a Sacrifice properly so called, or of an Vnproper Sa∣crifice, such as are Prayers and Thanksgiving, &c. So you. You contend for a Proper Sacrifice, and Wee denye it: and now that wee are to grapple together, wee shall first charge you with alleging a corrupt Translation, as the ground of your false In∣terpretation. That the Romish Objection is grounded upon a false Text, which is in your Romish Vulgar Translation; even by the judgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. I. YOur Romish Vulgar Translation (which was decreed in the Councell of Trent to be the onely Authenticall, and which
thereupon you are injoyned to use in all your Disputations; and not this only, but bound also thereunto by an Oath in the Bull of Pius Quartus, not to transgresse that Decree) doth deliver us this Text [In every place is sacrificed and offered to my name a pure Oblation, &c.] without any mention of the word Incense at all: whereas (which your CardinallBellarm. In Hebraea, & Graeca Editione sic Legimus [Incensum offertur nomini meo, & Sa∣crificium mundum.] Quo supra. confesseth) Both the Hebrew and Greeke Text hath it thus; [Incense is offered in my name, and a pure offering, &c.] and that More plainely, saith yourSeptuaginta apertiùs. Valent. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 4. pag. 526. Valenta. Which warranteth us to call your Vulgar Translation false, as wee shall now prove, and you perceive, without any farre Digression. For wee meddle not now with the generall Controversie, about this Translation, but insist onely upon this Particular, that as A Lion is knowne by his claw, so your Vulgar Translation may be discerned by this one Clause, wherein the word, Incense, is omitted quite. If yee will permit us, without being prejudicated by your Fathers of Trent, to try the Cause by impartiall Iudges, which are the Ancient Fathers of Primitive Times; especially now, when you yourselves are so urgent in pressing us with multi∣tudes of their Testimonies, for Defence of your Romish Sa∣crifice, even in their Expositions of this Text of Malachy: Looke then upon theBellar. Vo∣cem illam [Incen∣sum] interpretatur Tertull. Orationem, ut & ante eum Iren. lib. 4. cont. Haeres. cap. 33. Incensa au∣tem Iohannes vocat orationes Sanctorū. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. §.

Marginalls, and you shall find men∣tion of the word, Incense, (according to the Hebrew and Greeke Texts) in the very same objected Testimonies of Tertullian, Irenaeus, Hierome, Chrysostome, Eusebius, and Augustine. Not∣withstanding, wee should not be so vehement, in condemning your Romish Translation in this point, if the matter, now in hand, did not challenge us thereunto: the word, Incense, being sufficient in it selfe to satisfie all your Objections taken from the Sentences of Fathers, and urged by virtue of the word, Sacrifice, and Oblation, as will appeare. That the Text of Malachy doth not imply a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, by the Expositions of Ancient Fathers. SECT. II. TWo words wee finde in this Prophet, concerning the new Testament: One is, Incense, in the Text now alleged; the other is the word, Levites. The first in Chap. 1. vers. 3. [In every place there shall be an Offering of Incense, and a Sacri∣fice, &c.] You All affirme of Prayers, Praises, and holy Actions, that they are Spiritual, and no proper Sacrifices. But the Fathers, by you objected, (to wit, Tertull. Irenaeus, Hierome, Chrysostome, Eusebius, and Augustine) doSee the pre∣ceding Marginalls. Expound Incense to signifie these Spirituall Duties, which are unproperly called Incense. There∣fore may wee as justly conceive, that the word, Sacrifice, used
by them, and applyed to the service of God in the New Te∣stament, was meant Improperly; and that so much the rather, because your Cardinall hath no Objection out of the Fathers for his advantage in the word, Sacrifice, which hee loseth not by the word Incense, from point to point. For to the first Objection wee oppose, saying, The word Incense, is likewise used withoutSee in the Te∣stimonies above cited, for it is called abso∣lutely Incense, and not Incense of Pray∣er, &c. Addition. To the second, Wee accordingly say, Incense was meant also to be Pure: for you will not imagine, that God would promise to his faithfull in Christ Impure things. To the third, It is as well said concer∣ning Incense, as of Sacrifice (against the Iewes, vers 10.) I will not receive any offerings at your hands:Isaiah 1. 13. Incense is an abomina∣tion unto mee. To the fourth, The same Godlesse Iewes did joyntly contemne Gods worship made by Incense, as by Sacri∣fice, except you shall thinke it credible, that the same men should be both devout and profane in one prescribed Service of God. To the last, Malachy in the same Sentence (and as it were with the same breath) equally taketh exceptions to the Iewish Priests, in both Sacrifice, and Incense. Therefore, as the word, Incense, so accordingly the word, Sacrifice, was used Improperly of the Fathers. Do you not now see what reason your Cardinall had, to make choise of a corrupt Text, wanting the word Incense? which hee peradventure foresaw would prove as bitter as Coloquintida in his Pottage. The second word in Malachy is [Levite,] I will purge the sonnes of Levi; which was spoken (as your CardinallBellar. Post∣quam dixerat Mala∣chias [Offertur no∣mini meo oblatio munda] Exponit ca. 3. à quibus offeren∣da sit munda obla∣tio: Purgabit, inquit, Flios Levi: ubi, per Filios Levi, non pos∣sunt intelligi Levi∣tae veteris Testa∣menti—sed nostri Sacerdotes. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. §. Quintum. con∣fesseth) of the Ministers of the New Testament. Well then, did the Prophet call the Ministerie and Service of the New Testa∣ment, Pure Sacrifice? And did hee not in the like maner call the Ministers of the New Testament Purged Levites? as also some of the AncientAugustine, Ambrose, Cyprian, Leo. Fathers (you know) used to do: and as your Church, in degrading of Arch-Bishop Cranmer from his order ofMr. Foxe Acts and Monuments pag. 2117. Levitico ordine te privamus. Deaconship once did. Therefore both alike were used Improperly, in imitation of this Prophet, and also of that inIsa. 66. Isaiah, I will send them Priests and Levites. That the Text of the Prophet Malachy doth confute the Romish Pretence of Sacrifice, even by the objected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers. SECT. III. PErmit you us, for brevity-sake, to contrive this Section into Ob. and Sol. your Cardinalls Objections, and our Solutions or Answers. I. Ob. Sacrifice is called pure alwayes, and in all places, Ergo, Christs Body. Sol. And Chrysostome (who is Chrysost. in Psal. 95. (objected) Malachias appellat Thymiama urum,  pieces. obiected) termeth Prayers, Pure Incense (meaning when, or
wheresoever.) II. Ob. The word, Sacrificè, is spoken of in Ma∣lachy, without an Adjunct, as to say the Sacrifice of praise, &c. for these are improperly called Sacrifices, Ergo, &c. Sol. Yet First,Tertul. Ob. by Bellarm. lib. 3. contr. Marcion. ex Psalm. 57. In Eccle∣sijs benedicite Do∣minum Deum, ut pa∣riter cōcurreret Ma∣lachiae prophetia, In omni loco Sacrifici∣um mundum: Glo∣riae silicet relatio, & Benedictio, & Laus, & hymni. [Which words Bellarmine re∣straineth to Prayers and Prayses onely, in the Masse, whereas Tertullian speaketh of Prayers in gene∣rall.] Againe, Lib. 4. advers. Marc. a little after the beginning. Dicente Malachia, Sacrificium mundū, scilicet, simplex ora∣tio de conscientia pu∣ra. [Where hee ex∣poundeth Pure Sacri¦fice to be Praier.] Tertullian (objected) expounded the same word, Sa∣crifice, to signifie Benedictions, and Praises. And Secondly, Euseb. De∣monst lib. 1. cap 6. [In omni loco Incensum & Sacrificium, &c.] Quid aliud significat quàm orationis In∣censum, & Sacrifici∣um, quod [mundum] dicitur? est enim non per cruores, sed per pias actiones summo Do offerendum. Eusebius (objected) calleth this Pure Sacrifice, Pious Actions and Prayers. Which your Cardinall could not Answer, but with a marvellous and miserable Illusion. III. Ob. By the word, Bellar. Resp. Non quasi Oratio sit ipsum Incensum, seu Sacrificium, sed illud quod per Orationem, id est, per verba Consecrationis perficitur. Solent enim Patres verba Consecrationis orationes, seu mysticas preces interpretati. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. [First, fondly, for the words of Consecration containe in them no terme of Prayer: And secondly, falsely, for the Fathers did not call these words Prayer. Both which have beene amply discussed.] Sacrifice, were not meant Spirituall Sacrifices, &c. Sol. Yet Hieron. (obje∣cted) Malach. 1. Vt sciant Iudaei carnalibus Victimis spitituales successuras. Thymiama, hoc est, Orationes Sanctorum offerendas, Oblationem mundam, ut est in ceremonijs Christianorum. Bellar. Licet per Incensum intelligat orationem, tamen per Sacrificium intelligit Eucharistiam: dicit enim offerri in Ceremonijs Chri∣stianorum. [Be it so, but the Question is, whether the Action of the Eucharist be not called spirituall, that is (as is confessed) an Vnproper Sacrifice.] Hierome (objected) expresly nameth the Sacrifice, in Mala∣chy, Spirituall. To come to your Cardinals principall Reason. IV. Ob. The Iewish Sacrifices were called Vncleane, not in respect of the Offerers onely, but of the Offerings; intimating thereby, that this Offering in the new Testament can be no lesse than the very Body of Christ. Sol. Irenaeus (objected) plainely put∣teth the difference to be made, by Malachy, betweene the Sa∣crifices, as they were the Offerings of the wicked Iewes, and the Sacrifices of godly Christians; and hee giveth this Rea∣son, becauseIrenaeus (ob.) advers. Haeres lib 4. cap. 34 speaking as well of Sacri∣fices in Iudaico populo, as in Ecclesia, saith; Non Sacrificia sanctificant hominem, sed Conscientia pura ejus, qui offert, &c.] Then of Eleemosynae, Which the Apostle calleth Hostiam acceptabilem▪ [Opportet nos obla∣tionem Deo facere in sententia pura. And then, Ecclesia offert oblationem hanc Fabricatori puram, offerens ei cum gratiarum Actione ex creatura ejus. Iudaei autem non offerunt, quia manus eorum plenae sanguine, &c. The Iewes (saith hee) offered up their Oblations with wicked hearts, but the Christians performe theirs with pure Consciences. And that the Iewish Sacrifices were not re∣jected for themselves, but for the impiety of their Sacrificers; your owne IesuitRibera Ies. Ad loca Scripturae adducta respondere Apostoli. Apud S.

None to be ignorant, that the Sacrifices of the old Testament were all cleane and pure, because God hath ordained them, and they became impure by the wicked hearts of the Offe∣rers. And Tertullian giveth the same Observation for the Rea∣son, why God, in rejecting them, said,Tetull. li. 3. advers Ma∣cion.

Lib. adversus Iudaeos. I will no more of [your] Sacrifice, and not of [my] Sacrifice.
But you will say, Some of the Fathers spake directly of the Proper Sacrifice of the new Testament. Wee answer, that as they apply it to the Eucharist, they meant no proper Sacrifice, as the Subject, but onely as the Object therein, which was that of the Crosse. In which respectChrysost. (ob∣jected) in Psal. 95. Ex hostia prima mensa mystica coeleste Sa∣crificium, summéque venerandum. Est au∣tē in nobis varia dif∣ferentia: Lex multas habet Hostias, Gra∣tia nova unam—Vis scire Victimas, quas Ecclesia habet?—quando fit Sacrificium mundum & immaculatum? audi Scripturam Tibi palàm exponen∣tem hanc differentiam. Et Sacrificium, quod antea dixi spirituale, illud mysticum donum, in quo Apostolus Ephes. 5. Christus tradidit se ipsum pro Nobis Deo Sacrificium. Chrysostome (objected) calleth it that Sacrifice, whereof Saint Paul writeth, saying, [Christ gave himselfe up a Sacrifice for his Church.] Ephes. 5. Lastly, Cyprian (objected) calleth it theCypr. (object:) ex ib. 1. cont. Iudaeos cap. 16. Novum Sacrificium, Sacrificium Laudis. New Sacrifice of Praise: which is, you know, a Spirituall, and no Corporall or Proper Sacrifice. The second Propheticall Text (as is pretended) is Psal. 72. 16. concerning a [Handfull of Corne in the Top of the Mountaines:] objected to prove a Sacrifice in the Romish Masse; but yet as very Romishly, as were the rest. SECT. IV. OF this Corne yourPsal 7. juxta Heb. [Et erit pugillus frumenti in summi∣tatibus montium] vulg. Lat [Et erit fit∣mamentū in terra in summis Montium.] Galatinus de Arcani Cath. Veritatis, li. 10. cap. 5. Hoc est, dicit Chaldae a Translatio Rabbi Ionathae, Et erit sacrificium panis in summis montium.—Cum ergo ait, E∣rit placenta frumenti in terra, in capite montium, vult dicere, quod placenta panis et Sacrificium in ca∣pitibus Sacerdotum, qui sunt Ecclesia. Haec ibi—Nec mi∣rum de sapientibus an iquis Judaeorum Messiam placentam frumentï, & frustum panis futurum dixisse. The same hath Cocciu Thesaur. Cath. lib. 6. Art. 4. pag. 679. He addeth other Authors, to wit, P. Galatinus, Claud. Sanctesius, & Genebrard. in hunc Psal. Coccius ibid Art. 16. pa. 763. Disputers Coccius, Duraeus, Sancte∣sius, Genebrard, out of Galatinus, and Hee out of the Chal∣dee Translation, and other his supposed Iewish Rabbins, have observed a Cake on the top of the Mountaines. But what of this? This Cake, forsooth, was by their Doctrine a Propheticall pre∣diction of the Romish Wafer-Cake, which is heaved up over the head of the Priest for a Sacrifice. And this is called, by Master Brerely,Master Brerely in his Protestants Apol. noting Duraeus the Iesuit to have urged the same out of Galatinus. A most strong Argument, in behalfe of the said Doctrine. {fleur-de-lys} Yea, and your JesuiteSuarez in 3. Thom. Disp. 74. § 2. Adduci solent verba illa Psalmi 71, ut in Hebr. erit Placenta—qui Psalmus fine dubio de Messia scriptus est. Suarez seemeth to like this Cake, for hee also will needs have a licke at it. {fleur-de-lys} But wee must tell you, that your Galatinus is too credulous, and that his Rabbinicall Abstracts are no better than the Gibeonites old torne Shooes, and mouldy Bread, seeming to have come from farre, even from old Rabbins, when as they were invented and brought from their latter Rabbins and Glozers, as it were from the next bordering Countries: because your Author Galatinus (who produceth the foresaid Rabbinish prediction of that Cake) is branded, for such like his Conceipts, with the marke of a Vaine man, by your judiciousSenensis Biblioth. lib. 2. §. Traditiones. Non possum satis mirari stu∣dium Petri Galatini, qui—in eam Vanitatem devenit, ut doceret opera Thalmudica in Latinum veri opo∣re, & public in Scholis Christianorum explicai. Senensis. And the Chaldee
Paraphrase, which talketh of your Sacrificed Cake, is rejected, as being a Corrupt Puddle of Iewish Fables; and fabulous in this very Point, by your great Romane DictatorBellar. in Psal. 71. ver. 16. Scio quod Paulus Burgensis ex Paraphrasi Chaldai∣ca adferat ad proban∣dum hoc in loco Sa∣crificium Missae: sed scio etiam quā mul∣tis fabulis Iudaicis Pharaphrasis illa sca∣teat, ideò piget ex lacunis Expositionū Iudaicarum haurire, &c. Bel∣larmine. Which wee speake not, as being offended to heare any Rab∣bi calling that, which is in the hand of your Priest, and above his head, A Cake, which in your Romish Phrase is called, a Wa∣fer-Cake: for if it be indeed and truly a Cake, then is not it Accidents onely, but hath still in it the Substance of Bread. And so farewell your Helena of Trent, called Transubstan∣tiation. Now because the Sacrifice can be no better than the matter thereof will permit it, it followeth that the Sacrifice is not Properly the Body of Christ, but the Element of Bread. And thus your Authors (after their laborious kneading and moulding, their greedy longing, and their sweetly chewing hereof) are at length in a maner choaked with their owne Cake. CHALLENGE, {fleur-de-lys} By way of Vindication of the truth of our Allegation of the words of Master Brerely; against a late slanderous Romish Traducer. SECT. V. A Bold Romanist of late, as it seemeth, not well disge∣sting this Cake, hath in his dispersedAs I recei∣ved it from a Right Honourable Person, the Lord C: Papers divulged me in this maner: MY Lord of Durham saith of the for∣mer Reason, that it is called of Master Brerely a [Most strong Argument;] but is most untruly said, as will appeare to any one that reades the Protestants Apology. Pag. 156. So hee. Flatly and sharply, as you see, charging mee with a palpable untruth, and for Tryall referring himselfe to the Booke it selfe; and I Subscribe, saying, Sit Liber Iudex. The Booke is Master Brerely his Apology in his Treatise 1. Sect. 4. Subd. 12. Pag. (as the Romish Seducer himselfe hath truly quoted it) 156. where Master Brereley his words (for I hope they are not flowne out of the Booke since) are expressely these: This therefore so plaine foresaid Predi∣ction, made by the ancient Rabbins before Christs time in be∣halfe of Catholike Doctrine, concerning Reall presence, demon∣strating it selfe so evidently to have proceeded, not from any Se∣condary cause, but onely from a Divine instinct; yeeldeth here∣by a [MOST STRONG ARGVMENT] in behalfe of the said Doctrines. So hee. Therefore do not I know what to impute unto this Ro∣manist,
because of his denyall of these words, A most strong Argument, rather than the spirit of a Strong Delusion, is∣suing from the worst kinde of malice, whereof the Adage speaketh, Veritas Odium parit. Yet shall this piece of Falshood be accounted scarce a Venial Sin among you, being spoken to the disgrace of a Protestant, and in Defence of a Romish Priest. The best is, that the Seducer seemeth to be ashamed of the Absurdity of this your Rabbinish Objection, which hee was so loath to acknowledge. A Second Vindication, against another Sinister Romish De∣traction; shewing that the other Scriptures, which are said to be Propheticall, are not Iudicially ob∣jected by your Cardinall. SECT. VI. YOur Cardinall hathBellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 9. In 1. Reg. cap. 2. Sa∣crificium successurum Aäronico, interpre∣tatur Sacerdotio & Sacrificio Christia∣norum. Prov. 9.

Quarè Daniel cum vocat Iuge Sacrificium, loquitur de vero & propriè dicto Sa∣crificio. collected divers Texts of the Old Testament, which the Fathers apply to the Eucha∣rist under the name of Sacrifice, thereby concluding, that they judged the Encharist to be a Proper Sacrifice. These places have beene thought to an importunate Romanist worthy the Answering, which I purposely passed by, as superfluous, and such as were effectually enough satisfied in the Confutation of your other Objections, made out of the Figure and Type of Melchisedeth, and Prophecie of Malachy. Now our Taske must be, to shew the Injudiciousnesse of your Cardinall, in urging such Testimonies of the Fathers, as if they were necessarily Concludent, for a Proper Sacri∣fice; who considered not, that most of such like Applica∣tions, used by the Fathers, as Proper Interpretations, were no other than Allegoricall Allusions, and Assimulations. Where∣in wee durst Appeale to your Cardinall himselfe, who if hee had thought these kinds of Applications to be Argumen∣tative, might have made five moe Chapters of the like Al∣lusions. This our Answer may be exemplified and illustra∣ted by the like liberty and liberality of Speech used by the same Fathers in their Witty and Elegant Allusions to Bap∣tisme, whereof your owne LauretusHieron. Lauretus Sylva Allegoriarum Tit. Aqua. Citeth ten Fathers. Aquae Marah, quae per Lignum factae sunt dulces. Exod. 15. Baptismus. Aquae usque talos. Ezek. 47. Baptismus mundans . A∣qua in pelvi.

Potest etiam Aqua significare Baptismum, & Spiritualia dona gratiae. [And he citeth above 40. Texts in the old Testament.] giveth you divers Instances from the testimonies of Ten Fathers, applying
the Water of Marah, Exod. 15. The Water which tooke men up to the Anckles, Ezek. 24. The Water in a Bason, Iud. 6. The Waters of Contradiction, Psalm. 80. The Waters wher∣in the dust of the Golden Calfe was throwne, Exod. 32. Each one of which Waters they apply unto Baptisme. And, being not contented with these, hee referreth you unto above Forty places moe of the Old Testament, which may have the like Relation to Baptisme; none whereof can be pro∣perly called a Literall Explication, but onely an Allegoricall Application of Scriptures. The Second Argument of his Injudiciousnesse is discerna∣ble in this, that all that is alleged proveth no more than that which Protestants confesse, to wit, that the Eucharist may be called a Sacrifice, either Eucharisticall, or Latreuticall, in a Spirituall Sense, as the Fathers do after expound themselves. Thirdly, to come to that wherein your Cardinall is most peremptory, saying that the [Iuge Sacrificium, that is, Conti∣nuall Sacrifice] prophecied of, should be taken away by An∣tichrist, cannot meane any Spirituall and improper Sacri∣fice. but the Reall and Proper Sacrifice of the Masse. But wee say that the Fathers understood it of the proper Spirituall worship of Christians. Now whom would you wish to be Moderator betweene us? Wee guesse some Romish Doctor should be the man; and above all, some one out of the Schoole of the Iesuites; and of these, such an one must be most fit, who is knowne to be of a more moderate Temper than the most of them. Behold the man, even your Iesuite Pererius Ies. in Dan. 12. Anti-Christus tollet Iuge Sacrificium, vel, ut est Graecè, Endele∣chismum, quod vo∣cabulum sonat Con∣tinuitatem, nimirum Divini cultus, qui in Ecclesia Dei omni tempore exhibetur: sic enim interpreta∣tur Hieronymus, Theodoretus. Et hunc Dei continuum cultū appellavit An∣gelus Iuge Sacrifici∣um—QVANQVAM id nominis praecipuè refersi potest ad san∣ctissimum Missae Sacrificium—& hoc rtè nominatur Sacrificium juge. Nam non uno duntaxat in loco, nec bis tantum per singulos dies, manè & vesperi, ut illud Iudaicum, sed in omni loco & omni tempore Deo offertur. Idem Lib. 9 in Dan. Cap. 8. Gregorius tricesimo Moralium, Cap. 12. Omnia verba, de Antiocho, explicamus de Anti-Christo—Iuge Sacrificium tollit, quià studium sanctae conversationis Ecclesiae in eis quos caeperit, interrumpit. Pererius, who coming to explaine this [Iuge Sacrifi∣cium] out of the Fathers, granteth that indeed these Fathers, Hierome, and Theodoret, understood thereby the Divine wor∣ship of Christians, in generall. And that Pope Gregory ex∣poundeth it of the Christian Conversation of Life, which shall be interrupted by Antichrist. So hee. But yet the same Je∣suite, perceiving that this reached not home to the Sacrifice of your Masse, straineth courtesie with the Fathers, and without any their Authority, or rather against it, cometh in with his [QVANQVAM:] Notwithstanding (saith hee) this name of, Continuall Sacrifice, may be referred to the Sacrifice of the Masse, because that is not as the Sacrifice of the Iewes; in one place onely, or at morne and night, but continually in all places, and at all times. So hee. Which any Iew (if hee heard it)
would thinke were unadvisedly spoken, saying of their Iewish Continuall Sacrifice, that it Continued to be offered both in their Morning and Evening worship; whereas the time of your Romish is prefixed but in the Morning Service onely, and therefore cannot be so justly called [Iuge] or Continuall, as the Jewish was; because nothing can be cal∣led [Iuge] in respect of Place, but onely in respect of Time. {fleur-de-lys}. CHAP. V. Of our Second Examination of this Controversie, by the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers, shewing that they never called the Eucharist a Sacrifice, Properly. Our Generall Proposition. The ancient Fathers never called the Eucharist, Properly, a Sacri∣fice: proved by many Demonstrations. THe Demonstrations, which wee are to speak of, are many; some taken from the proper, and some from the pretended Subject of the Eucha∣rist; some from the parity of like speeches of Fathers, as well in other Sacraments, Acts, and Adjuncts, as in these which are belonging to the Eucharist. The first Demonstration, That the Fathers called Bread and Wine a Sacrifice; (but Improperly) as being the Subject matter of the Eucharist. SECT. I. THat Ancient Fathers called Bread and Wine a Sacrifice, even before Consecration, wee have it confessed asseverantly by

Ita locuti sunt etiam Christiani an∣tiqui, ut constat ex verbis Cypriani in Serm. de Eleemos. Locuples matrona si∣ne Sacrificio in Do∣minicum venien.

And that the Primitive Fathers called Bread and Wine, Sacrifice, after Consecration also, wee have likewise proved in two fullSee above Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Se∣ctions: which your Cardinall is bound to acknowledge, who, to prove that Melchisedech Sacrificed Bread & Wine, produced the Testimonies of Ambrose, August. Chrysost. Oecumenius, and Theophylact, to conclude them to have beene Figures of the Eu∣charist, which wee desire you to carry still in minde, untill wee end this Section. Hereupon wee demand, whether you thinke that Bread and Wine, in the Eucharist, can be called of Christians a Sacrifice Properly, either before, or after Consecration? No (saith one Valent. Ies. objicienti Melchisedechum obtulisse panem & vi∣num tantùm. Resp. Sacerdotium Christi secundum ordinem, Melchisedech—Etiam ratione rui obla∣tae, non quatenus oblatione illius substantiae determinatae, scilicet panis & vini, exercebatur. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 4. Iesuite) because it is not agreeable to our Priesthood. No (saith a Bellarmin. respondens quaestioni; An cum solus Panis mutatur, si propri sacrificaetur? Inquit, Id absurdissimum esset: tum haberet Ecclesia Sacrificium inanimum, & vilius multo quàm habue∣rint olim. Hebraei. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27. §. Sed haec. Second) because it were most absurd that the Church of Christ should have a livelesse Sacrifice, and consequently more vile than was the Iewish. No (saith aNefas est, crdere Ecclesiam obtulisse rem ullam corpoream & terrestrem Deo post abrogata omnia hujusmodi Sacrificia terrena. Maldonat. Lib. de 7. Sacram. Tom. 1. de Eucharist. part. 3. §. Primum Argumentum. Third) because it were an heinous impiety now, after the abrogation of the terrene Sacrifices of the Iewes, to believe that the Church of God should professe an Offering of Corporall and earthly Sacrifices. No (saith aSalmeron. Communis sensus est omnium Christianorum, non esse aliud Sacrificium quàm Corpus & Sanguinem Christi—At si pa∣nis esset Sacrificium, sequeretur, quòd res inanimata sacrificaretur—Et quòd summa Lattia esset circa panem & vinum. Tom. 9. Tract. 12. § Quinta. Fourth) for it is the judgement of all Christians, that there is no Sacrifice in Chri∣stian Religion, but the Body and Blood of Christ: because other∣wise the Act of Sacrificing thereof, being a Divine worship, should be exercised upon Bread and Wine. So they. Wee would be glad to take the Apostle of Christ to be our Guide, for our better security, hee (as is likewiseBellarmin. Apostolus declarat, non esse terre∣num aliquid quod offert Christus, si esset super terram, ex Heb. 8. 4. Et ostendit nunc meliores hostias offerr Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. sect;. Resp. quid. [See above Chap. 3. Sect. 2.] confessed) teacheth, that God now is not to be worshipped, by way of Sacrifice, with any out∣ward thing. Oh that your Divines would exercise their quils in publishing such sound Truths as this is, wee then would wish them Good speed in all their Writings. Notwithstanding, upon considera∣tion of the Premises, wee are inforced to complaine of the Vn∣conscionablenesse of your Cardinal, who, to prove a proper Sa∣crifice in the Eucharist, did (as you may remember) produce
the Testimonies of five Fathers, wherein that, which they called a Sacrifice, they expressed to be Bread and Wine; which by the joynt and consonant Confession of the Cardinall him∣selfe, and other prime Iesuites of his owne society, cannot be held to be Proper Sacrifices, without Absurdity and Impiety. And the like obliquity of Iudgement you may finde in your Rhemish Divines, inRhemists An∣not. in Luc. 22. 19. alleging the Testimonies of Irenaeus, for proofe of the Sacrifice of your Masse, which your Iesuite Maldonate hath truly observed to have beene spoken of Bread and Wine, evenSee above at (a.) before Consecration. One word more. By this you may perceive another proofe of the Idiome of Ancient Fathers, in Extending the word [Sacrifice] beyond it's literall sense: which (beside the for∣mer) the last annexed Testimonie ofTo these for∣mer, wee add another objected Testimony of Augustine, Lib. de side ad Pet. Diac. cap. 19. Nulltenus dubites unigenitum Dei fili∣um obtulisse hostiam Deo pro nobis, cui nunc cum Patre & Spiritu Sancto offerimus Sacrificium panis & vini, in side & charitate, in Catholica Ecclesia per universum mundum. Augustine confirmeth, shewing, that now there is in this our Sacrifice no other Subject but Bread and Wine. This may serve for the present, concer∣ning the true and proper Subject of the Eucharist, Bread and Wine. Wee in the next place are to examine the pretended Subject, which your Church will have to be the Body and Blood of Christ. Our Second Demonstration, That the Ancient Fathers held not the Body and Blood of Christ to be the proper Subject matter of the Eucharist, in calling it a Sacrifice. SECT. II. HOw cometh the Body and Blood of Christ to be a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist? Your Cardinall will tell us, to wit, Bread and Wine are consecrated, and by Consecration made the Body and Blood of Christ: so that nowBellarm. lib. 1 de Missa, cap. 27. §. His igitur—In Missae Sacrificio re∣quiritur ut res profa∣na sit sacra: sic hic, ubi panis convertitur in corpus Christi—§. Respondeo, &c. Non panis, sed quod expane factum pro∣priè sacrificatur. [For still the Question is that of Lombards; Quaeritur si quod ge∣rit Sacerdos, sit pro∣priè sacrificium. Lom∣bard. lib. 4. Dist. 12. lit. G. Not Bread (saith hee) but the Body of Christ is the thing sacrificed. This is plaine dealing, and as much as if hee had said, If there be in the Eu∣charist no Transubstantiation of the Bread into Christs Body, by Consecration, then cannot Christs Body be a proper Sacrifice. But that there is no such Transubstantiation, or Corporal Presence of Christs Body in the Sacrament, hath beene proved to be the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers, by many Demonstrations tho∣row-out the third and fourth Bookes. A stronger Argument there needeth not.
Our Third Demonstration is, Because the objected places of Antiquity, for proofe of a Repre∣sentative Sacrifice, Properly so called, do not point out any∣where the Body of Christ, as the proper Subject, but only as the Object of the Sacrifice spoken of. SECT. III. The necessary use of this Distinction. OVr Distinction is this. These words, The Body and Blood of Christ, as they are applyed to the Eucharist, in the name of Sacrifice, may admit of a double Acception; one is to take them Subjectively, as being the proper Materiall Subject of this Sacrament; the other is to understand them Objective∣ly, that is, to accompt the Body and Blood of Christ, as they were the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse, to be onely the proper Object of a Christian Celebration, according to the Direction and Institution of Christ, saying, Do this in remem∣brance of mee. Your Romish Church professeth the Body and Blood to be the proper Subject; Wee nay, but the proper Ob∣ject of our Celebration. This Distinction, well learned, will be unto our Reader as an Ariadne's thred, to winde him out of the Labyrinth of all Obscurities, and seeming Repugnan∣cies of Ancient Fathers; out of all the confused Subtilties, and equivocall Resolutions of your Romish Disputers; and out of the Perplexities, wherewith some Protestants also may seeme (in some sort) to have beene intangled. The Demonstration it selfe, Because the Eucharist, being onely Commemorative and Re∣presentative, cannot be a Proper Sacrifice: answe∣ring the Romish Objection taken from the Sacrifices under the Law. SECT. IV. THat it cannot be called properly a Sacrifice, which is onely for Commemoration and Representation, is the Conclusion of your owneBellarm. Si sola repraesentatio Sacrificij crucis, tùm non potest dici obla∣tio in hunc modum: Offero tibi Pater, &c. ac à Patribus Ob∣latio dicitur. Lib 1. de Missa, cap. 15. §. Quartò. Cardinall; although it cannot be denyed, but that Improperly it may be so called, aswell as you may call the Image of Christ crucified, the Crucifix. But, to come to
your Objection, yourRhemists A∣notat. in Luke 22 and Bellarm. Finis e∣rat Sacrificiorū prae∣cedentium repraesen∣tare Sacrificium Cru∣cis, ut futurum, & si∣cut vetera Sacrificia non amittebant ve∣ram & propriam ra∣tionem Sacrificij, ex eo quòd essent re∣praesentativa: ita nec Sacrificum Euchari∣stiae, amittit propri∣am Sacrificij rationē, propter Commemo∣rationem. Lib. 1. de Mssa. cap. 12. §. Qod verò. Rhemish Divines and Romish Car∣dinall are very earnest and instant in proving, that because the Iewish Sacrifices, being Representations of the Passion of Christ, were notwithstanding True and proper Sacrifices: Therefore the Being Representative can be no hindrance that the Eucharist should be a proper Sacrifice. So they. But yet so, as if they had meant to say nothing to the purpose, because the Iewish Sacri∣fices, albeit they were Representations of Christs Passion, yet were they not onely Representations thereof, as the Eucharist is, but were also, beside that, Sacrifices in themselves, and so ordained to be by God; first in their matter, as Bulls, Sheepe, Goates; next in their Sacrificing Act, which was Destructive, as to be slaine; and lastly, in their proper and peculiar end, which was (as yourBellarm. Sa∣crificia illa Levitica non culpam. & poe∣nam aeternam, sed immunditiem lega∣lem, & poenam tem∣poralem expiabant.—Patet ex Dei promissione de remissione peccatorum; ex mensura Sacrificij majoris & minoris pro majore &  delicto. Levit. 6. & 4, & 5. At pro peccatis gravioribus, ut blasphemia, homici∣dio, &c. nulla videmus instituta Sacrificia. Lib. 4. de poeaitent. cap. 15. §. Respondeo. & §. Ex his. Non quoad culpam & poeam Gehennae, nisi quatenus signa erant protestantia fidem in Christum, ut docent communiter Theologi. Idem l. 2. de effect. Sacram. c. 17. Et omnia illa erant Sacrificia vera, & signacula promissionis Chri∣sti venturi & morituri. Idem lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 24. Cardinall witnesseth) For expiation of le∣gall Pollutions, and remission of temporall Punishments. Each one of these may satisfie your Objection: {fleur-de-lys} And (as your Vasquez in 3. Thom. Disp. 222. cap. 8. Discrimen inter Reprae sentationem mortis Christi in hoc Sacramento, & in Sacrificijs antiquae legis est, quod illa non erant ideo Sacrifica, quia mortē Christi repraesentabant; sed quia Immolatione Rei oblatae denotabant Deum, authorem vitae & mortis. Vasquez will say) for The acknoledgment of Gods Sove∣raigntie over life and death.{fleur-de-lys} The Confirmation of the former Demonstration out of the Fathers; first Explaining of themselves. SECT. V. SAint Ambrose setting forth two kinde of Offerings of Christ, here on Earth, and above in Heaven, hee saith that Ambr. Vmbra in Lege, imago in E∣vangelio, veritas in coelestibus: antè ag∣nus offerebatur, nunc Christ▪ offertur qua∣si Homo, quasi reci∣piens passionem, & offert sese ipse quasi Sacérdos, ut peccata nostra dimittat, hîc in imagine, ibi in ve∣ritate, ubi apud Pa∣trem pro nobis quasi Advocatus interve∣nit. Lib. 1. de Offic. Cap. 48. Christ here is offered as one suffering, and above hee himselfe Offereth himselfe an Advocate with the Father for us. And this our offering of him hee calleth but an Image; and that above hee calleth the Truth. Clearly shewing that wee have, in our Offering, Christ's Body onely as it is Crucified, which is the Object of our Commemoration; But the same Body, as it is now the personall subject of a present Time, and Place, they behold it in Heaven; even the same Body, which was once offered on the Crosse by his Passion, now offered up by himselfe to God, by Presentation in Heaven; here in the Church onely by our Representation Sacramentally on earth. Saint Augustine dealeth as plainly with us, where distin∣guishing
three States of Offerings up of Christ, heeAugust. Hujus Sacrificij caro & san∣guis antè adventum Christi per victimas similitudinum pro∣mittebatur; in passi∣one Domini per ip∣sam Veritatem: post Ascensum per Sacra∣mentū memoriae ce∣lebratur. Cont. Faust. lib. 20. cap. 21. Tom. 6. Nōne semel immo∣latus est Christus, & tamen in Sacramen∣to quotidiè immola∣tur? He addeth, Nec tamen mentitur, qui dicit Christum im∣molari: si enim Sa∣cramenta non habe∣rent similitudinem rerum ipsarum, quas repraesentant, non essent Sacramenta. Ex qua similitudine nomina eorum acci∣piunt. Aug. lib. Epist. 23. [See of this above Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 5. And yet againe, more plainely in his 20 Book against Fau∣st, cap. 21. it follow∣eth;] Vt Baptismus dicitur sepulchrū; sic, Hoc est corpus me∣um. saith first, that under the Law Christ was promised In the Similitude of their Sacrifices: meaning, his bloody death was prefigured by those bloody Sacrifices. Secondly, in the offering at his Passion hee was Delivered up in Truth, or proper Sacrifice, this was on the Crosse. And Thirdly, after his Ascension, The memorie of Him is celebrated by a Sacrament, or Sacramentall Representation. So hee. For although the Sacrifices of the Iewes were true Sacrifices, yet were they not truly the Sacri∣ficings of Christ. Note you this Assertion. Againe, speaking of his owne Time, when the Sacrament of the Eucharist was daily celebrated, hee saith, That Christ was once sacrificed (namely upon the Crosse) and is now daily sacrificed in the Sa∣crament; nor shall hee lye (saith hee) that saith Christ is sacrifi∣ced. So hee. No, holy Augustine, shall hee not lye, who saith that Christ, as the personall Subject of this Sacrament, is a Proper Sacrifice in the Literall Sense? (for, whether Proper or Vn∣proper, are the two Seales of this Controversie.) Now inter∣pose your Catholike Resolution. Say first, why is it called a Sacrament? tell us;See above Book 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 8. out of his Epist. 23. ad Bonifacium. If Sacraments had not a similitude of things, which they represent, they were no Sacraments, from which si∣militude they have their Appellation and name of the things (to wit) The Sacrament of the Body of Christ is called his Body, as Baptisme is called a Buriall. Be so good as to explaine this by another, which may illuminate every man, in the point of Sa∣crifice also, although otherwise blinded with prejudice. Epist. 23. ad Bo∣nifac. Paulò ante ver∣ba superiora, nem∣pè, Pascha appropin∣quante, saepè dicimus crastinam Domini passionem, cum ille ante multos annos passus sit, nec omni∣nö nisi semel ista pas∣sio facta sit, nempè isto die: (dicimus) Christus resurrexit, cum ex quo resurre∣xit tot Anni transie∣runt, cum nemo ita eptus sit qui nos ita Ioquentes arguat nos esse mentitos—ut di∣catur ipse Dies, quia non est ipse, sed si∣milis—none semel immolatus est Christus? &c. As when the day of Christs Passion (saith hee) being to mor∣row, or the day of his Resurrection about to be the next day but one; wee use to say of the former, To morrow is Christ's Passio; and of the other, when it cometh, it is Christ's Resurrection, yet will none be so absurd as to say, wee lye in so saying, because wee speake it by way of Similitude: even so when wee say, this is sacrificed, &c. So Saint Augustine. Who now seeth not, that as the Buriall of Christ is not the Subject matter of Baptisme, but onely the Representative Ob∣ject thereof; and as Good-Friday, and Easter-day, are not properly the dayes of Christ his Passion, or Resurrection, but Anniversarie, and Represensative, or Commemorative Re∣semblances of them: So this Sacrifice is a Similitude of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Crosse, and not materially the same. {fleur-de-lys} Lastly heare Augustine againe:Aug. lib. 1. Con. advers. Leg. & Proph. cap. 18. Mors Christi unum & unicum verum Sacrificium. The death of Christ (saith hee) is the onely true Sacrifice. {fleur-de-lys} Wee omit Testi∣monies of other Fathers, which are dispersed in other Sections. Although this one Explanation might satisfie, yet shall wee ad∣joyne
others, which may satiate even the greediest Appetite in the Demonstrations following. The fourth Demonstration, From the Fathers Explanation of their meaning, by a kinde of Correction. SECT. VI. ANcient Fathers in good number call that, which is repre∣sented in the Eucharist, and which wee are said to offer, The same Host, not many; the same Oblation, no other; the same Sacrifice, and none but it: but they adde by a Figure , that is, a Correction of the excesse of their speech, or rather for Caution-sake, (lest their Readers might conceive of the same Sacrifice herein as properly present) saying in this maner; Wee offer the same Sacrifice, or rather the Remembrance thereof; allu∣ding sometime expresly to the Institution of Christ, [Do this in remembrance of mee.] The Fathers are these, viz.Chrys. . Heb. 10. om. 17. pa. 1171. [Christus semper suo sanguine intra] Ipse Sacrificium, Sacer∣dos, & Hostia: si hoc non esset, multa oportebat etiam Sa∣crificia offerri, saèpiùs oportebat crucifigi.—Eandem ipsam Hostiam, quā Chri∣stus immolabat, offe∣rimus, [:] vel potiùs Recordationem ipsi∣us, &c. Chryso∣stome, Theophylact in Heb. 10. pa. 885. 886. Nunc & ipsi sine san∣guine immolamus? Ita quidē, Sed Chri∣sti tunc reminiscimur obitus: & una nobis est immolatio, non multae, quandoquidē & ille semel immo∣latus est. Eundē sem∣pe offerimus, quin potiùs Oblationis il∣lius memoriam faci∣mus, perinde asi es∣set hoc tempore im∣molatus. Quocirca u∣num esse hoc nostrū Sacrificium constar.—Vnicum est & semel oblatum—nam & unus est sanguis, & semel fusus. Theophylact,Theod. in Heb cap. 8. Cum essecit ut alia Sacrificia non essent necessaria, cur novi Testamenti Sacerdotes mysticam Liturgm seu Sacrificium peragant? sed clarum est ijs, qui sunt in rebus divinis cruditi, nos non aliud Sacrificium offerre, sed unius illius salutaris memoriam per∣agere—Dixit enim, Hoc facite in memoriam mei. Theodoret,Ambros. in Hebr. 0. Osterimus quidem, sed Recordationem salutaris mortis ejus, & una haec Hostia, non multae. Ambrose,Euseb. Demonst. Evangelic. lib. 1 cap. 10. Sacrificamus & incendimus, aliâs autem magni Sacrificij illius memoriam, . Eusebius, and Primasius in Heb. cap. 10. Quod Deus &c. Offerunt quidem Scerdotes nosti, sed ad recordationem mortis ejus—sicut ipse dixit, Hoc facite in Commemorationem mei.—Vna hostia, non mul∣tae—Corpus unum cum illo, quod suscepit in utero virginali, non autem multa Corpora, nec nunc qui∣dem aliud magnum, aliud minus. Primasius. Your onely Answer is, that their Exception, here used, was not to note that it is not the same Body of Christ here Corporally present, which was offered upon the Crosse; but that it is not offered in the same maner by effusion of Blood, as that was; which is indeed a Part, but not the whole Truth. For survey the Marginalls, and then tell us! If that your Sacrifice were the same Body of Christ Corporally present, why should The∣ophylact apply his qualification not to the maner, whether Bloody or Vnbloody, but to the person of Christ? saying, Wee offer the same Christ, who was once offered, or rather a Memoriall of his Oblation. And Theodoret applying it directly to the thing, [Non aliud] Wee offer not another Sacrifice, but a memoriall therof. Why Eusebius? Wee offer a Memoriall in stead of a Sacrifice. Why Chrysostome? The same Sacrifice or rather a Commemoration of it: every one directly requiring that the Thing, which wee offer, be the same crucifyed Bloody Sacrifice of Christs Death, (which S. Augustine but even now named The onely true Sa∣crifice
of Christ, (in the former Section) but that they plainly notifyed unto us, that they meant the same very Body, which was the Subject of the Sacrifice on the Crosse, to be the now proper Object of our Remembrance in the Eucharist, but not the Subject therein. Which agreeth with that which in the former Section was said by Ambrose, Our offering up of Christ in an Image; and Au∣gustine his celebrating of this Sacrament of Remembrance. Sem∣blably, as Hierome speakes of the Priest, who is said to take the Person of Christ in this Sacrament, so that, He (saithHier. Tom. 5. lib. 13. Com. in Ezec. cap. 44. Qui offerat Deo Sacrificium, ita ut verus Sacerdos sit, imò Imitator ejus, qui est Sacerdos se∣cundùm ordinē Mel∣chisedech. Idem Tom. 9. lib. 4. cap. 26. in Matth. Sicut Melchi∣sedech panem & vi∣num offerens, ipse quoque veritatē cor∣poris & sanguinis sui repraesentat. Hierome) be a true Priest, or rather an Imitator of him. But a Priest, and an Imitator, is not Identically the same that is represented. Master Brerely is not Christ. {fleur-de-lys} Yea, and Saint Hierome will speake as directly of the Differences of the two Sacrifices, as hee doth of the two Priests; for distinguishing betweene them,Hier. in Levit. & extat in Decret. de Consec. dist. 2. Can. De hac—De hac qui∣dem hostia, quae in Christi commemora∣tionem mirabiliter fit, edere licet: de illa verò, quam Chri∣stus in ara crucis ob∣tulit secundùm se, nulli edere licet. In this Sa∣crifice (saith hee) which is marveilously done in commemora∣tion of Christ, one may eat: but that which hee offered of him∣self upon the Crosse, no man may eat. Where hee noteth two Sacrifices, One Here, and another on the Crosse: the first offered by Another, and the second by Himselfe. And hee separateth them (in respect of the Subject) as THIS, from THAT; which if they were subjectively, really, and perso∣nally the same, then the Eating of the one should be the Eating of the other, which S. Hierome denyeth: Of THIS one may eat, (saith hee) but not of THAT. {fleur-de-lys} Lastly, The same (saidSee the former Marginalls at the let∣ter (f.) Primasius) in all places, which was born of the Virgin, & not now great, & now lesse. So he. But have wee not heard you number your many Hosts on one Altar, at one Time? and yet the Fathers say, Wee offer not many, but the same, which must needs be the same one, as Object; else shew us where ever any Father denyed but that upon diverse Altars were di∣verse Breads; or that but, according to their outward Dimen∣sions, they were now greater, now lesse; which no way agreeth with the Body of Christ, as hath beene proved in discussing the See above B. 4. Chap . Sect. 5. Canon of the Councell of Nice.
The fifth Demonstration, Because the Body and Blood of Christ, as they are pretended by the Romish Church to be in this Sacrament, cannot be the Representative Sacrifice spoken of by Ancient Fathers; against your vaine Instance in a Stage-play, being the last refuge of your desperate Disputers wherein their whole Defense consisteth. SECT. VII. THat the Subject matter of this Sacrament (by you called the same Sacrifice, which Christ offered up upon the Crosse) ought to be Representative, and fit to resemble the same Sacri∣fice of his Passion, is a matter unquestionable among all. In which respect the Fathers have so often called it a Sacrifice of Commemoration, Representation, and Remembrance; and that the thing to be represented is his Body crucifyed, and his Blood shed in that Sacrifice of his Passion, is a point as questionlesse: which accordeth both to the words of Christ his Institution [Do this in remembrance of mee,] and to the Exposition of Saint Paul, to be a [shewing forth of the Lords death untill hee come:] yea and is also consonant to the last mentioned Do∣ctrine of the Fathers, calling it A Sacrifice of Christ, or rather a Remembrance thereof. The onely Question will be, how This, which you call The same Sacrifice, meaning the Body of Christ, subjectively in the Eucharist, being invisible, can be said to represent, figure, and resemble the same Body, as it was the Sacrifice on the Crosse? Wee yielding unto you a possibility, that one thing, in some respects, may be a Representation of it selfe. Your Triden∣tine Fathers to this purpose say, thatConcil. Trident. Christum reliquisse Sacrificium Ecclesiae suae visibile, quo cru∣entum istud in Cru∣ce peragendum re∣praesentaretur. Ses. 22. ca. 1. Christ left this visible Sacrifice to his Church, whereby his Body sacrificed on the Crosse should be represented. So they. From whom (it may seeme) your Rhemists learned that Lesson, which they taught others, thatRhemists Annot. in Luc. 22. Christs Body, once visibly sacrificed upon the Crosse, In and By the selfe same Body is immolated and Sacrificed under the shapes of Bread and Wine, and is most perfectly thereby resem∣bled: and therefore is most properly Commemorative; being cal∣led the same Sacrifice by the Ancient Fathers. And againe, This neerely and lively resembleth that. So they. But this wee ut∣terly deny, because although a thing may in some sort be re∣presented by it selfe, yet (say wee) there is no Representative quality of any Body and Blood of Christ (as it is said by you to be in the Eucharist) of his Body and Blood sacrificed upon the
Crosse. And upon the Truth or Vntruth of this our Assertion dependeth the gaining or losing of the whole Cause, con∣cerning the Question of Sacrifice, now controverted be∣tweene Vs. Two of your Iesuites have undertaken to manifest your Re∣presentation (by a more fit example than do your Rhemists) thus;Barradas Ies. En tibi stupendam Dei adinventionem no∣tam facimus. Animo concipiamus Regem aliquem post repor∣tatam de Hostibus Victoriam, &c. Sic Christi corpus veluti in scena personatur, id est, speciebus panis & vini velatur, &c. Tom. 4. Concord. Evang lib. 3. cap. 13. §. Optimus. And Bel∣larmine. Even as a King (say they) having got a victory, should represent himselfe, after his warre, in a Stage-play in fight, &c. {fleur-de-lys} Or as your Cardinall Peron is said to have fancied; As David might have represented his owne Combate with Goliah in a Theater. {fleur-de-lys} So they, even in earnest, which hath beene as earnestly, yet easily, confuted by usSee above Book. 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. there answered.] Corpus & sanguis Domini sub specie panis & vi∣ni signa sunt corporis ejus passi, & sanguinis effusi, &c. See above also in the same place, Chap. 3. already; although, indeed, the Play deserveth but laughter. And that so much the rather, because the Representative part (as your Councell of See here∣after, Chap. 6. Sect. 1. Trent hath defined) is in your Masse a visible Sacrifice, whereby the Bloody Sacrifice of Christ on the Crosse might be repre∣sented, as you have heard. {fleur-de-lys} For here is no visibly-re∣presented person, but the Priest; no visily-represented, or crucified Body, but the Bread Broken. But no more is the Bread Christ's Body, than the Breaking thereof is his Cruci∣fying; or yet the Priest, Christ. {fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. Displaying furthermore the Stollidity of this your onely Ro∣mish Defence, concerning an Vnbloody Representa∣tive Sacrifice of Christ's Body sacrificed on the Crosse; from another Romish Principle, and from the Absurdity of the Defence it selfe. ALl Christians, be they Protestants, or Romanists, whensoever they allow of the name of Sacrifice, whether in a large and common, or in a strict and proper Sense, they evermore professe it to be the Representative and Commemorative of the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse. But how it is Representative, is become the maine hinge of the whole Controversie. Protestants hold and teach this to consist onely in the Analogie betweene the Consecrated Elements of Bread and Wine, and the use thereof in the Eu∣charist; and the Body and Blood of Christ on the Crosse. But you Romish maintaine a Representation of Christs Sacrifice on the Crosse by Analogie with his Body and Blood, as it is in this Sacrament. The Analogie of Representation, held by
Protestants, is such as your owne Doctors will grant to be true in every part and point. First, for the End of the Celebration of the Eucharist, it is confessed, thatVasquez Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 220. Vt finis Sacrificij ve∣teris legis erat reprae∣sentare Sacrificium Crucis, ut futurum: sic finis est Sacrificij Eucharistiae reprae∣sentare Sacrificium Crucis, up praeteritum. The end thereof is to represent the Sa∣crifice on the Crosse. Secondly, Nor will any of you deny, but the formes of Bread and Wine do Represent the Body and Blood of Christ. Nor (thirdly) will you gaine-say, that the Separation of Bread from the Wine, in the Eucharist, doth represent the Separation of Christ's Body and Blood on the Crosse. Which are the three Summarie Points of Repre∣sentation, held by Vs, contrarie to your professed Represen∣tation made (as you have said) by Christ's Body and Blood, in the Eucharist, of the same his Body and Blood separated on the Crosse, as it were in a Stage-play. {fleur-de-lys} You therefore (except you will be Players, and not Dispu∣ters) must tell us, where ever it was seene or heard of a King, as Conquerour, or yet of any other, of what condition soever, acting himselfe, and that Visibly, Perfectly, and Truly (as you have said) yea or else any way semblably Representing him∣selfe, when as yet the same King, or party, was to all the Spectators altogether Invisible? If You can, then shew where this was Acted, whether it were not in Vtopia? And who was the Actor, if not ? and of what Disposition the Spectators were, whether not like the Man of Argos, who is said daily to have frequented the Theater and Stage alone, void of all Actors, yet seeming to himselfe to see all Varie∣ties of Actions; occasioning him to laugh, and applaud at that which hee saw represented to himselfe onely in his owne phan∣tasticall Braine? Now have you nothing else to Answer, but (which you have already said) that The Body and Blood in the Eucharist are visible, by the visible shapes of Bread and Wine. Whereas it had beene much better you had answered, indeed, nothing at all, rather than not onely to contradict that, which was said by your Fathers of Trent, (decreeing the Representation to be made By the Sacrifice on the Altar it selfe; and more expresse∣ly by yourSee above at () Rhemists, In and by the same Body in the Eucharist:) but also to expose your selves to the reproofe of your Adver∣saries, and Scorne of any man of common Sense; as if you would perswade him his money is Visible to any that will use his eyes, which hee hath therefore locked close up in his Coffer, lest any man might see it. {fleur-de-lys} Besides, this your Romish Principle and Doctrine of Concomitancie is not unknowne unto you, which is, that not∣withstanding whatsoever Consecration of Bread severally from the Wine, yet the Body and Blood of Christ are con∣tinually in the Eucharist, as Veseparably united together; his
Blood being in the veines of the same Body, as verily as it was before his Passion. Hence wee argue, that this Inse∣paration of Christ's Blood from his Body, which you be∣lieve to be in this Sacrament, can no more possibly repre∣sent the Separation and Shedding of Christ's Blood from his Body (which all Christians believe to have beene in his Sa∣crifice on the Crosse) than Crookednesse can resemble Straightnesse; or Light, Darknesse. Therefore is not the Romish Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ, Repre∣sentative of his Body and Blood on the Crosse, notwithstan∣ding that (as hath beene confessed) this Representation be the end of the Celebration of the Eucharist. {fleur-de-lys} The Sixth Demonstration Of the No-Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, because divers Epithets objected, as given by Fathers to this Sa∣crifice, are used also by them where there is no Proper Sacrifice. SECT. VIII. IT is objected by your Cardinall, that Ancient Fathers gave certaine Epithets, and Attributes to the Eucharist. I. Some calling it a Full & Pure; II. Some, Terrible Sacrifice; III. Some termed it in the Plurall number Sacrifices and Victimes. His Argument (in the Margin) is this: If the Fathers had held the Sacrifice of the Eucharist to be but onely Representative, They would not have called them in the Plurall number Sacrifices. So hee,Bellar. lib. 1. de Miss. cap 15. §.

Fathers named Prayers, Giving of Thankes, and other holy Actions and Commemorations themselves, Sacrifices and Hoasts, in the Plurall number. And is not there in the Eucharist Prayers, Hymnes, and Thanksgivings? Nay, but know, that inasmuch as the Fathers have called the Eucharist in the Plu∣rall number Hoasts, and Sacrifices, it proveth that they were not of your Romish Beliefe of Concomitancie, to thinke (with you) that Bread being changed into Christ's Body, and Wine into his Blood, make but one Sacrifice; for there can be no Identity in Plurality. {fleur-de-lys} A Vindication of the Truth of an Answer, concerning the objected Testimonie of Eusebius, against a Romish Seducer. EVsebius is objected (in the Margin) as naming the Eucha∣rist, Sacrificium Deo plenum. My Answer there is, that these three words Are not undoubtedly spoken of the Eucharist. Which a Romish Seducer of late traduced, as untruly an∣swered: but yet giveth no Reason of his Exception; but as blindly as bluntly telleth mee that my Answer is False. But if I be mistaken, then hath Eusebius himselfe seduced mee, who, before the same words, speaketh of [Hostias in∣corporeas, & intelligentiâ praeditas:] specifying the Sacrifice of a contrite heart, and Sacrifice of Prayse. And againe im∣mediately after; [At Sacrificium Deo spiritus contritus.] Then, after this hee adjoyneth [Memoriam magni illius Sacrificij;] The Memoriall of that great Sacrifice; Meaning, the Eucha∣risticall Commemoration of the Sacrifice of the Crosse, as any that looketh not a-squint upon the place will easily perceive. Besides, all the Sacrifices of the New Testament, by him mentioned, hee calleth Incorporeall, and indued with Vnder∣standing. But you do as truly grant the Eucharist to be a Corporall Substance, as you wickedlySee above Booke 4. c. 9. §. 2 say, that Christ's Body therein is Without Vnderstanding. A Second Vindication of the Truth of our Answers to the former objectedSee above in this 8. Sect. Epithets, out of Ancient Fathers, against the said late Calumnious Ro∣mish Seducer. His words are these: Bellarmine lib. 1. de Missa, Cap. 15. To prove that the Fathers, when they called the Eucharist
a Sacrifice, meant a Proper Sacrifice, useth eight usuall Epithets, which the Fathers in this Case give to the word Sacrifice. MyTreatise of the Masse, Booke. 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 8. Lord of Durham undertakes to encounter him with the like, given to the word Sacrifice, when they manifestly speake of improper Sacrifices. This hee under∣takes, but performes nothing, for hee allegeth no saying of any Father, where any thing of this nature is called [Sa∣crificium Terribile, Plenum Horroris, Sacrificium Sum∣mum, Sacrificium Verissimum, Sacrificium Singulare, Sa∣crificium Deo Plenum.] So hee. That which should have been performed by mee, in this Treatise, was to shew that there were none of these Attributes, which Bellarmine collected out of the Fathers, as proper to your Romish Sacrifice of the Masse, but have beene as effectually applyed by Ancient Fathers unto Prayers, Praises, Baptisme, and other the like holy and pious Actions. Which the same your Bellarmine himselfe confes∣seth to be No proper Sacrifice. Notwithstanding have I lately beene Challenged by one, who saith (as becomes an egregious Seducer) that I have performed hereof nothing at all. Do you heare? Flatly, Nothing at all: Meaning, that none of the Epithets, above-mentioned by Bellarmine (out of the Fathers) were at any time attributed by them to any other thing but to your Sacrifice of the Masse. But what? Nothing at all? I. Not the Epithet [Terrible?] False. For I proved that the Fathers called Baptisme a Treatise of the Masse, Booke 6. Chap. 2. Sect. 1. 3. Sacrifice, and inscribed it [Ibid. Sect. 8. Terible] II. Not the Epi∣thet [Summum] that is, Chiefe? False. For the Father See Booke 6. Chap. 7. Sect. 2. Pelusiota is alleged, naming a Pure mind and chaste Body the Best Sacrifice. III. Not the Epithet [Truest?] False. For there is produced SaintAugust. See Booke 6. cha. 7. Sect. 2 Augustine not onely enstiling Every pious worke a True Sacrifice (& Vero nihil verius, saith the Philosopher) but also nothing that, Where God saith, I will have Mercie, and not Sacrifice; Mercie (saith hee) is a Sacrifice most Excellent, and whereof the other are but Signes. IV. Not the Epithet [Deo Plenum?] False. For it was proved effectually enough, in that the Preaching of the word, which is called of the Apostle, The Power of God unto Salvation, is termed ofChrysost. See oke. 6. Chap. 7. Sect. 2. Bo Chrysostome, a Pure and im∣mortall Sacrifice; And what would you say to your Divines of CollenEnchiridi∣on Coloniens. fol. 107. Hic Ecclesia (quae Corpus Christi my∣sticum est) se totam Deo consecrat, adeò ut Cyprianus tale Sacrificium, verum, et plenum Sacrifi∣um non dubitaverit appellare. who will have you observe Cyprian naming the Church of Christ, as his Mysticall Body, consecrated to God, a pure and full Sacrifice? Lastly, Not the last Epithet, which is [Singulare Sacri∣ficium?] whereof your Romish Seducer boastingly saith as followeth: [Singular Sacrificium, a Singular Sacrifice] which is the most convincing Epithet of all the rest, proveth
the Eucharist not onely to be a Sacrifice, but also to be the onely Sacrifice of the Church; whereas there be many im∣proper Sacrifices. This the Lord Bishop passeth over with Silence, and shutteth out for a Wrangler. So hee. Who might thinke it hapned well to himselfe, if hee should be but onely Shut out for a Wrangler, and not called in Question for a false and presumptuous Traducer and Seducer, for de∣nying that to be performed at all, which I did discharge with an Advantage, alleging that Ancient FatherSee Booke 6 Chap. 7. Sect. 2. Iu∣stine naming Prayers, and Thanksgivings [: The perfect and onely Sacrifices well pleasing unto God.] Can there be any thing more Singular than that which is Onely? The voice of Saint Augustine is full as loud, for the Sacrifice of Christ's Passion: The Death of Christ (saithAugust. See , Chap. 5. & Sect. 5. hee) is the onely Sacrifice, which being the onely true Sacrifice must necessarily exclude the Hoast in your Masse from the property of a true Sacrifice. If therefore this Epithet be an Argument most convincing above all the rest, (as is here objected) then must it follow that Bellarmine thus amply confuted, in this one, is in effect convinced of Rash∣nesse and Weaknesse in his arguing; aswell as this Seducer is of Falshood and Malice in his detracting in all the Rest.{fleur-de-lys} The Seventh Demonstration, Of No-Proper Sacrifice in the Euchrist: Because the Principall Epithet, of Vnbloody Sacrifice, used by the Fathers, and most urgently objected by your Doctors, for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice, doth evince the Contrarie. SECT. IX. IT hath beene some paines unto us, to collect the objected Testimonies of Fathers, for this Point, out of your divers Writers, which you may peruse now in the Margin with more ease, and presently perceive, both what maketh not for you, and what against you; but certainly, for you, just nothing at all. For what can it helpe your cause, that the Celebration of the Eucharist is often called , that is, An unbloody Sacrifice, a Reasonable and unbloody Service or Worship?

Paulo post: Deus Pater, qui oblata tibi dona mera, frugum obla∣tiones accepisti in o∣dorem suavitatis. [And after follow the words of Conse∣cration: Sancto, qui in Sanctis, &c.—Suscipe incorruptum Hymnum in sanctis & incruentis Sacrificijs tuis.]— Liturgies, (or if you will Missals) are objected, to prove that by Vnbloody Sacrifice, and Reasona∣ble and unbloody Worship, is betokened the Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood in the Masse; one of Basil, another of Chryso∣stome, and (by some others) the Masse of Saint Iames of Ierusa∣lem.
In which Epithet of Vnbloody (say wee) could not be sig∣nified Christ's Body. Our Reasons; because (as the Margin sheweth) the word, Vnbloody, hath sometime Relation unto the Bread and Wine (both unbloody) before Consecration, called in Saint Iames his Liturgie, Gods gifts of the first fruit of the Ground: who also reckoneth Hymnes among Vnbloody Sacri∣fices; (But Christ's Body is the fruit of the Wombe) or else some∣time it is referred to the Acts of Celebration, in Supplication, Thanksgiving, and Worship of God (all Vnbloody) naming that A Reasonable and Vnbloody Service, which they had termed an Vnbloody Sacrifice, as Lindan your Parisian Doctor hath truly observed. Which Chrysostome also stiled Spirituall (marke you) , Service, or Worship. Was ever Christ called , who is himselfe rather the Person to be worshipped? Secondly, Reasonable, could this point out Christ's Body in the Sense of the objected Fathers? Suffer Chrysostome to re∣solve us.Chrysost. Hom. 11. Quid est rationabile obsequium? quod per animam, quod secundùm Spiritum offertur: quicquid non indiget corpore; quicquid non indiget instrumentis, neque locis, in quibus ipse quidem est Pontifex, ut mansuetudo, pationtia, &c. Sacrificium laudis, justitiae, spiritus contribulati. Reasonable Service, (saith hee) is that which is performed with the minde, without Bodily helpe. {fleur-de-lys} The which Athanasius attributeth to Baptisme:Athanas. cont. Macedon. Dial. 1. de Baptismo. :  &c. This (saith hee) is a Reasonable and living Worship; whereof the A∣postle saith, Yield up your Bodies an holy lively Sacrifice, &c.{fleur-de-lys} Thirdly, The Vnbloody Sacrifice is called Spirituall (as you heare) how shall this be properly applyed to the Body of Christ? You will say, not in it's naturall Essence, but in the maner of being Invisible, Impalpable, and the like. But wee demand; the same head of a mans Body, is it more Spirituall in the darke than in the light? Lastly, all these termes in these Liturgies of Vnbloody Sacri∣fice, Reasonable Service, and Spirituall, are spoken before Con∣secration, when the Body of Christ, even in your owne Faith, as yet can have no being in the Eucharist; and therefore can∣not be the Vnbloody Sacrifice here meant by you. Will you have the full substance of all these Reasons? The word, Vn∣bloody, whether it point out Bread and Wine, or the Act of out∣ward Worship in this celebration, called a Reasonable Service, and Spirituall Sacrifice, it must betoken a thing void of Blood, which no Christian Professor dare attribute to the Body of Christ. Wee proceed. Eusebius saith indeed,. Euseb. Caesar. lib. 4. De Vita Constant. cap. 45. de Euchar. Alij sacras literas interpretantur: Alij , & mysticis con∣secrationibus divinum numen placabant, & supplices preces pro communi pace offerebant. Et Demonst. Lib. 1. Cap. 6. Sacrificium mundum. Wee offer an Vnbloody Sacrifice;
but what hee meant thereby, hee doth not expresse, whether the Signes of Bread and Wine, which hee elsewhere, with others, (as you have heard) called Sacrifices: or whether, as Basil and Chrysostome have done, hee understood together the Publike Service in celebrating the Memory of Christ's Death. This then concludeth not for an Existence of the Body of Christ, as of the Vnbloody Subject herein. But whereas furthermore your may observe, that Eusebius (objected) callethNon per cruo∣res, sed per quas acti∣ones summo Deo of∣ferendas. After, there followeth an Oration of Constantine, Ad Sanctorum coetum. Tale Sacrificiū per∣agitur, vacuum san∣guine, & ab omni violentiâ. [As . Dadraeus Doctor Pa∣ris translateth it.] Godly Actions a pure Sacrifice, and opposeth this against Bloody Sacrifices; and also termethAgaine, De∣monst. Evang. li. 1. ca. 10 Has rursus [] i. e. ma∣teriae expertia Sacri∣ficia, intelligēâ prae∣ditas hostias, Pro∣phetica nuntiant ∣racula?

Holy Prayers [] that is, Without Materiall Substance, as hee did the Celebration of the Sacrament [] that is, Vnbloody: And yet againe of this Sacrament; A Me∣moriall, saith hee, instead of a Sacrifice. These shew that Eu∣sebius meant a Sacrifice void of Blood; which neither the word of God will permit us; nor your Councell of Trent will suffer you to impute to the Body of Christ, and therefore must needs wound your Romane Oblation of Body and Blood to the very heart. Nazianzen (objected) is as directly opposite to your Masse, as East is to West, and will strike the matter dead, calling it Nazian. Invect. 1. advers, Iulian. ante med [] i. e.

Flatly differencing the unbloody Sacrifice, whereby, from Christ himselfe, with whom the Faithfull docommunicate in this Sacrament. Ambrose (objected) prayeth to God,Ambr. lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 6. Sacer∣dos dicit, Ergo me∣mores gloriosissimae ejus passions, offeri∣m̄us. Tibi immacu∣latam hanc hostiam incruentani, & hunc panem sanctum, & hanc oblationem salutis aeternae. To accept of this immaculate, and unbloody Hoast, which are the very words of your RomaneSuscipias in sublimi Altariuo perimentis  lorum, sicut accipere dignatus es munera Abel, &c. [To be expounded, as Bellarmine doth  the same words in the Roman Masse] Masse, and which your Cardinall seeketh to justifie by Saint Ambrose. But this hee cannot do, except their meaning be both the same. Let then your Cardinall but tell us the meaning of the Canon of your Masse, and you will soone apprehend the Iudgement of Saint Ambrose. In our Masse (saith yourAccipiendo sacrificium pro re, quae sacrificatur, negari non  &  in Missa offerri, ac proinde, pertinere ad rem, quae sacrificatur.

Respondeo it. [Because the Cardinall doth often in this and other Chapters justifie the Romane terme of Masse, by the  in Ambras] Cardinall) it is sayd, Receive, holy Father, this immaculate Hoast; where the Pronounce This (saith hee) doth domonstrate Bread and Wine, because spoken before Consecration. So hee. And the Body and Blood of Christ (you know, are not Bread and Wine. Let Athanasius put a Pe∣riod to this Section, who saith that Melchisedech dedit, Abrahamo vinum meracum addito panis [] frusto—hic typus fuit offerendi Sacrificium [] incruentum, sanctam oblationem. Hist. de Melchizedech. ad sinem. Tom. 2. Melchisedech, in gi∣ving Bread and Wine, was the first Type of an unbloudy Sacrifice. But Melahisedechs was Vnbloody, negatively, having no Blood at all in it. So was never the Body of Christ; since his Resur∣rection, according to our Christian Beliefe.
CHALLENGE. WHat a faire piece of service (do you thinke) have these Objectors done, for the patronizing of your Romane Sacrifice, out of the Sentences of Ancient Fathers? whilest they, alleging their words, citing their Bookes, and quoting their Chapters, have so handled the matter, as if they had meant, by prevaricating in their owne Cause, to betray it: see∣ing that it is apparent, that they have delivered unto us the worship, in stead of the thing worshipped, out of the Councell of Ephesus, Basil, Chrysostome, and Eusebius. Next by the word, Vnbloody, being spoken before Consecration (and therefore con∣cerneth not the Vnbloody Body of Christ) they have obtruded the thing, Distinguished from Christ, in stead of Christ, in the Testimony of Nazianzen. But especially, because in the most of the[Do but exa∣mine the places a∣gaine, and you shall find Basil to have spo∣ken of Seruice before Consecration: Chry∣sest. Of Blood and Wine, before Con∣secration: Eusebius in one place is inter∣preted (by your owne Doctor and Transla∣tor) to have spoken of a Sacrifice void of Blood; Nazianzene speaketh of something in the Eucharist, dif∣fering from Christ: to whom you may joyn Athanasius.] Sentences, the word Vnbloody, must needs be taken nega∣tively for want, or absence of Blood: and so you may bid your Corporall Presence adieu. All which may be strong Arguments unto us, both of the deplorable Consciences of your Doctors, and of the desperatenesse of your Cause. Other Testimonies, wherein there is mention of Christs Body and Blood, come now to be discussed. A Confirmation of the former Demonstration, from the use of the word, Vnbloody, in the objected Sentences; wherein the Fathers make mention of the Body and Blood of Christ. SECT. X. THis Objection seemeth to be of better moment than the former; but onely seemeth. Clemens Bishop of Rome, the first of that name, calleth (indeed) the Eucharisticall Celebra∣tion Clemens Rom. Const. lib. 6. cap. 23. Pro Sacrificio cruen∣to, Rationale & in∣cruentum ac illud mysticum Sacrificium corporis & sanguinis Christi, quod in sym∣bolum mortis ejus celebratur. Et lib. 7. Co. cap. 26. Adhuc agimus tibi grarias, Pater noster, pro preroso corpore & sanguine effuso, cu∣jus haec Antitypa ce∣lebramus, ut mor∣tem ejus denunciare∣mus, per ipsum enim tibi gloria. Amen. An unbloody Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ. In which sentence the Vnbloody Sacrifice is plainly distinguished from the Body and Blood, whereof it is a Sacrifice, even as both the Act and Service of Commemoration have beene oftentimes above, and are hereafter called of the Fathers a Sacrifice, in re∣spect of the Object thereof, which is the Body and Blood of Christ on the Crosse. This is manifest by two especiall Reasons; the first, because that which hee calleth Vnbloody, hee termeth also a Reasonable Service. Secondly, Clemens calleth the same Vnbloody Sacrifice the Signe and Type of Christs Body and Blood, thereby distinguish∣ing them from that Body and Blood whereof they are but Types. You will then aske, what is this Body and Blood, whereof they
are sayd to be Types? Yea marry, This being knowne will set all straight. And Clemens telleth you, that it is his Precious Body, and his Blood shed, which (properly taken) all Christians professe to be Proper to his Body crucifyed, and Blood shed on the Crosse, for the proper Object of our Typicall Remembrance, as wee have formerlySee B. 2. Ch. 2. § 4 and this B. 6. Ch. 1. § 2. proved, and you your selves have confessed already. Cyril. Hierosol. Mystag. 5. Postquàm consecimus [] Ali∣quanto post, Obsecra∣mus Deum pro, &c. Et Christū [] Ob.  Salmerone Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 30. Cyril of Hierusalem doth attend upon Pope Clemens, and in a sort treadeth in his steps. The maner of our Celebrating the memory of Christs death, hee calleth a Spirituall Sacrifice, and an Vnbloody worship; wherein, against the Iewish Sacrifice, hee opposeth Spirituall against Corporall, as hee doth Vnbloody against Bloody. But, by Spirituall, hee meant that which wan∣teth a Body. Therefore, by Vnbloody, hee meant that which was properly voyd of Blood. So farre was Cyril from signifying thereby the Vnbloody Body of Christ, as the Subject matter in the Eucharist. As for the Body & Blood of Christ it selfe, which hee calleth Propitiation, Cyril expoundeth himselfe to meane (for so hee nameth it) Christ slaine for our sinnes, which still wee say, and you cannot deny, is onely the Object of our whole Spirituall service of Remembrance and Commemoration. Both these former Witnesses have delivered their Testimonies, as spoken under a forme of Prayer, whereunto whether You or Protestants may more justly say Amen, judge you. Cyril Patri∣arch of Alexandria accordinglySee below Sect. 15 acknowledgeth a Sacrifice Vn∣bloody, Spirituall, and Mentall.

Hee speaking of the Body of Christ, as it was a Sacrifice eaten of his Disciples in his last Supper, held the Crucifyed Body of Christ to have beene even then so necessary an Object for his Disciples Ea∣ting thereof, that hee saith:Greg. Nyssen. Orat. 1. de Resurrect. Christi.

It was even then eaten as a perfect Sacrifice of Christ. But how? to wit, saith hee, as slaine. His Reason; for a Body having life (saith hee) cannot be fit to be eaten. So hee. Than which nothing can make more against your Eating of Christs Body, as Corporally Pre∣sent; or yet against a Proper Sacrifice therein. {fleur-de-lys} What thinke you of such Sayings?

If you should be ignorant, your Cardinall Alan would teach you, & he would have youObservandum est, Christum licet modo impassibili ex∣istat in Sacramento, tamen dici à Patri∣bus mortalem, imo∣mortuum & passum in Sacramento, eate∣nus quidem, quate∣nùs ox modo Con∣secrationis, ipsaque vi significationis Sa∣cramentalis mors, & passio Domini com∣memorantus atque repraesentantur. Alan. Card. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 38. sub finem. Ob∣serve what hee saith: Christ is said by the Fathers to suffer (saith hee) and to dye in this Sacrament onely so farre as his Death and Passion is commemorated and represented herein. And so speaketh also your RomaneGlossa de Consecrat. Dist. . Quid fit. Hoc est, ejus Mors repraesentatur. Glosse. What now hindreth but that whensoever wee heare the same Fathers affirming that the same Body and Blood of Christ are Sacrificed in the Eucharist, wee understand them in the same impropriety of Speech, that they meant onely Repre∣sentatively? especially when as wee see your other Grand Cardinall coming somewhat home towards us, and to confesse as followeth;Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 29. §. Respondeo si, &c. Si Catholici dicerent in Sacrificio Missae vere Christum mori, argumentum Calvini haberet aliquid vi∣rum; sed cum dicunt omnes eum non mori, nisi in Sacramento, & signo repraesentante mortem ejus, quam uliquando obij, tantùm abest, ut Missa obleret Christi mortem, ut potiùs efficiat ut nunquam obliteretur. If Catholikes should say that Christ doth truly dye in this Sacrament, this Argument might be of some force: but they say hee dyeth not, but in Sacrament and Signe representing. So hee; which yet alas is too little a crevase for so great a Doctor to creepe out at. First, because there is aswell a Figurative, as there is a Literall Truth; for, If I should say of Easter day (saidSee above Chap. 5. Sect. 5. Augustine) it is the day of Christ's Resurrection, I should not lye, and yet it is but the Anniversa∣rie day, betokening the other. When Christ said of one part of this Sacrament, [This Cup is the New Testament in my
Blood] hee spake by a double Figure, said your IesuiteBooke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 4. Salme∣ron, yet truly. Secondly Christ, who is Truth it selfe, in saying of Bread, This is my Body, or Flesh, spake a Truth, as you all professe; and was it not likewise a Truth, when hee called his Flesh Bread? yea, and alsoIoh. 6. The true Bread. Thirdly, the Fathers, as they said that Christ is Dead, and suffereth (as you now object) in this Sacrament in a Mysterie: so have they also said of his Body, in respect of the Eucharist, It is Sacrificed in anAmbrose, Aug. above, Chap. 5. Sect. 5. Image, in a Sacrament, or Mysterie; ac∣cording to that their generall Qualification, saying, It is the same Sacrifice which Christ offered, orAbove, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. rather a Remembrance thereof. And Lastly, the Fathers, who named Baptisme a Sacrifice aswell as the Eucharist, doubted not to stretch Baptisme up to as high a note as they have done the Eucharist, saying, Chrysost. in Epist. ad Heb. Hom. 16. Baptismus est passio Christi. Baptisme is the Passion of Christ: andAmbros. de Poenitent. lib. 2. cap. 1. In Baptismo cru∣cifigimus in nobis fi∣lium Dei. In Baptisme wee crucifie Christ. To signifie, that the Body of Christ is the Represented Object, and not the Representative Subject of this Sacrament. An Elucidation of the Premises, by a Similitude of a Stage-play, manifesting how the same Vnproper Sacrifice might fur∣thermore have beene called both Bloody and Vn∣bloody, by Ancient Fathers. SECT. XII. A Similitude, for explanation-sake, would be had; give us leave to borrow one from the Stage-Play, for manife∣sting a Truth, aswell asBooke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. and Booke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 7. you have done another from thence, for palliating a Falshood. You may recognize with us that Tragicall end of the Emperour Mauritius, by the command of one Phoca, (once his Slave) that Grand Patrone of the Popedome, by Privileging the Church of Rome, to be the Head of all Churches, as divers of your owne Historians do re∣late. But to the Point. By the commandement of this Phocas (as youSee Baron. Anno 602. &c. know) were slaine two of Mauritius his Sons, three Daughters, and his Wife; and all these before his owne eyes, and at last the Emperour Mauritius himselfe was also murthered. Were now this dolefull Spectacle acted on a Stage, might not any Spectator say (at the horrid sight thereof) This is a Bloody Tragedie, namely, in respect of the Object represented herein? And might hee not also say as truly, This is an Vn∣bloody Tragedie? to wit, in respect of the Representative Sub∣ject, Action, and Commemoration it selfe, seeing that there is
not here shed any one drop of mans Blood? And from the same Evidence it will be easie to perceive, that the Greeke Fa∣thers used to terme the Eucharist [] and the Latines Tre∣mendum, that is, a Terrible and Dreadfull Sacrifice, (namely) for the Semblance-sake, and Analogie it hath with Christ's Death: even as one would call the Act, representing the cruell Butchering of the Emperour Mauritius, an Horrible and Lamentable Spectacle. This is a cleare Glasse, wherein any may discerne the open visage of Truth, from the feigned Vizard of Errour. The ninth Demonstration, Because Ancient Fathers likewise called the Sacrament of Bap∣tisme a Sacrifice, for the Representation-sake which it hath of Christ's Death; which is Argu∣mentum à paribus. SECT. XIII. WEe shall not urge the Antecedent of this Argument, ta∣ken from Baptisme, before that wee have made knowne the force of the Consequence thereof. First one of your Car∣dinals thus;Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 15. Si Pa∣tres existimarunt Eu∣charistiam solùm esse Sacramentum, & non etiam Sacrificium, nulla esset causa cur aliter loquerentur de Eucharistia, quàm de Baptismo. Nusquam autem Patres Baptis∣mum vocant Sacrifi∣cium, nec dicunt Bap∣tizare esse Sacrificare, vel immolare. Quo modo igitur possibile est Patres in modo loquendi nobiscum, in sententia cum Ad∣versarijs convenisse? §. Hic igitur. Rursus Baptismus est Sacra∣mentum Repraesen∣tationis mortis Chri∣sti, Rom. 6. Et tamen nulli veterum Baptismum Sacrificium Deo oblatum unquam appellaverunt: non igitur sola repraesentatio causa esse potuit, cur actio Coenae Sacrificium appellaretur. Ibid. §. Tert. bapt. If the Fathers had held the Eucharist to be only a Sacrament, and not also a Sacrifice, there had beene no cause why they should not have called Baptisme a Sacrifice, it being a Repre∣sentation of Christs death: But the Fathers do no where call Bap∣tisme a Sacrifice. So hee. Another Cardinall thus,Card. Alan. Patres abusos esse nomine Sacrificij—quis possit cum Haereticis vel tenuiter suspicari, cum hoc solum eo nomine appellent, nec alteri fetè Sacramento unquam tribuunt? Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 14. Who can so much as suspect that the Fathers spake abusively, in calling the Eucharist a Sacrifice, seeing this is the onely Sacrament, which they call a Sacrifice, and no other. Next, take your learned'st Iesuite with you, who would be loth to come behinde any in vehemencie and boldnesse, thus;Suarez Ies. In multis Conc. vocatur hoc Sacrificium incruentum—Solum est observandum, propter Haereticos, qui hoc etiam ad me∣taphoram detorquent nomen, Sacrificium. Sanctos Patres nunquam vocâsse Ministerium Baptismi, aut alte∣rius Sacramenti nomine Sacrificij, cum tamen Sacrificium Metaphoricè sumptum in eo conveniet. Cum ergo Eucharistiam simpliciter & absolutissimè Sacrificium vocant, signum est eos propriè de Sacrificio loqui. Tom. 3. Dsp 74. Sect. 2. pag. 952. Ancient Fathers ne∣ver called Baptisme or the Ministery thereof a Sacrifice; albeit they might have so called it Metaphorically: which wee note (saith hee) because of the Heretickes, who pervert the speeches of the Fa∣thers, as if they had called the Eucharist a Sacrifice Metaphori∣cally, and Improperly. So they, to omitM. Fisher, for one. Others. Now then if there be any sap or sense in these your Objectors, it is as much as if they had reasoned against us thus; If you Heretikes
(for so they call Protestants) could shew that the Ancient Fa∣thers did any where name the Sacrament of Baptisme a Sacrifice, which wee confesse to be onely but a Representation of Christs death, then should wee need no other Reason to perswade us that the Fathers called the Sacrament of the Eucharist a Sacri∣fice also, Improperly, onely because it representeth the Body and Blood of Christ sacrificed on the Crosse. Thus for the Conse∣quence confessed by your owne chiefest Advocates. The Assumption lyeth upon us to prove, to wit, that the Fa∣thers called Baptisme a Sacrifice, even from the words of the Apostle, Hebr. 10. 20. where, speaking of Baptisme, he saith; To them that sinne voluntarily, there remaineth no Sacrifice for sinne. Saint Augustine testifyeth of the Doctors of the Church Catholike, before his time, thatHebr. 10. 26. [Voluntariè peccan∣tibus non relinquur Sacrificium pro pec∣cato.] Qui dili,  pertractant hunc lo∣cum Apostoli, intel∣ligunt de Holocausio Dominicae passionis, quod eo tempore of∣fert quisque pro pec∣catis suis, quo ejus∣dem passionis fide baptizatus. Vt sit sensus, [Non relin∣quitur Sacrificium pro peccatis] hoc est, non potest denuò bapti∣zando purgari. Au∣gust. Tom. 4. Expos. ad Rom. Col. 1185, 1186, 1187. They, who more diligently handled this Text, understood it of the Sacrifice of Christs Passion, which every one then offereth, when hee is baptized into the faith of Christ. So that holy Father, who is a Witnesse without all Exception; yet if, peradventure, wee should need any testimo∣ny our of your owne Schooles, the witnesse of your Canus may be sufficient, confessing and saying,Milchior Canus. Quaeris quid Causae pleris{que} Antiquorum fuerit, ut Baptismum Hostiam appellave∣rint, ideo{que} dixerint non superesse Hostiam pro peccato? (Heb. 10.) quia Baptismus repeti non potest—Et quia per Baptismum applicatur nobis Hostia crucis. Hinc illi Baptisma translatitiè hostiam nuncuparunt. Loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. pag. 424. That most of the Fathers, by Sacrifice, in this place understood Baptisme, which they so called Metaphorically, because by it the Sacrifice of the Crosse is applyed unto us. So hee. Is not this enough for the understan∣ding of the Dialect, and of the speech of Ancient Fathers; both in calling Baptisme a Sacrifice, and of the Reason thereof, to wit, for Representation and Application-sake onely; and Con∣sequently, that the Body and Blood of Christ are not the repre∣senting Subject, but the represented Object of his Sacrifice? What better satisfaction can the greatest Adversary desire, than to be (as now your Disputers are) answered according to their owne Demands? The tenth Demonstration, Because the Fathers called the Eucharist a Sacrifice, in respect of divers such Acts as are excluded by the Romish Doctors out of the Definition of a Proper Sacrifice. SECT. XIV. THe Acts excluded by your Cardinall out of the number of Proper Sacrifices, areBellarmin. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Sed omissa.—Omne Sacrificium est Oblatio, sed non omnis Oblatio Sacrificium, hoc fit cùm  oblata consumitur. Oblations, or Offerings of
any thing that is not Consecrated by the Priest, such as is the Offerings of Bread and Wine by the People, before it be Con∣secrated. NextBellarm. Opera virtutum non sunt propriè dicta Sacrifi∣cia. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Haec. Non quae in sola actione consistant, ut Psal∣modia, genuflexio, & opus quodlibet ad honorem Dei factum. Ibid. §. Secundum. Non quae in sola oblatione sita, ut au∣rum, argentum, &c. Ibid. §. Secundo. Non Non decimae aut pri∣mitiae. §. Sed in. Nec Patres appellant Sa∣crificium, id quod so∣lum est figura, & commemoiatio Sa∣crificij. §. Tertio. Non pia voluntas, quia invisibilis. §. Se∣cundò. Non Elee∣mosynae, quia non soli Deo oblatae §. Tertiò. Nulla re∣verentia externa, ut genuflexiones, precs, quia actiones transe∣untes. §. Sextò Pas∣siones Martyrum, & alia omnia bona ope∣ra; largo modo—non autem propriè & in rigore, Sacrificia dici possunt. Ibid. cap. 3 §. Resp. Martyrum. All workes of Virtue are unproperly called Sacrifices. All workes which consist in Action, being transient, as Bowing, singing of Psalmes, or the sole Commemoration of the Sa∣crifice of the Crosse: together with all such Acts performed to God, which otherwise are yielded to man, as the Gesture of Vncovering the head in Gods Service, Bowing the knee, and all outward signes of Reverence, yea and all inward and invisible Acts of man in his will and understanding. All these spirituall Acts are esteemed by him to be unproperly called Sacrifices. But that all these kinde of Acts, so farre forth as they are exer∣cised in the holy worship of God, are called Sacrifices by the Ancient Fathers, can never be denyed by any that ever was ac∣quainted with their Writings. Now our Demonstration is this, that most of these Acts, which are here confessed to be Vnproper Sacrifices, being used in the Celebration of the Supper of our Lord, occasioned the Fathers to call the Eucharist it selfe a Sacrifice; and therefore they meant thereby no Proper Sacrifice. As first (by your owneCassand. Li∣turg. cap. 22. Ordo celebrandi Missam, secundùm Romanos, celebrante Pontifice, extractus ex varijs li∣bellis—Ibid. cap. 27. Populus dat Eleemosynas suas, id est, Panem & vinum, tam masculi quàm foemi∣nae. Ibid. De veteri ritu oblationis panis & vini. I Euch. cap. 14. Who can so much as suspect that the Fathers spake abusively, in calling the Eucharist a Sacrifice, seeing this is the onely Sacrament, which they call a Sacrifice, and no other. Next, take your learned'st Iesuite with you, who would be loth to come behinde any in vehemencie and boldnesse, thus;Suarez Ies. In multis Conc. vocatur hoc Sacrificium incruentum—Solum est observandum, propter Haereticos, qt Isidorus, dictum quasi sacrum factum, quia prece mysticâ consecratur. Cassand. ibid. Non ignoramus veteres Theologos appel∣lâsse Eucharistiam Sacrificium laudis: Moldonat: lib. de 7. Sacrament. Tom. 1. part. 3. §. Praeter haec. pag. 322. Confession) that the Fathers called The Oblations of Bread and Wine, made by the People before Consecration, Sacrifices; the Almes, and Collections for the poore, Sacrifices; Our Praises and Thanksgiving to God (whereof the Eucharist hath it's name) Sacrifice: and that many other Circumstantiall Acts are called Sacrifices, even the Sole Act of our Commemoration, as will ap∣peare in our last Examination concerning the Doctrine of Pro∣testants. {fleur-de-lys} But yet some of you (among others your Pa∣melius) are so greedie of a Sacrifice in the Masse, that they will force Tertullian to speake for it, even where (as is con∣fessed and proved) hee speaketh of such Offerings, which belonged to theGabriel. Episcop. Albispin. Not. in Tertull. lib. ad Vxorem, cap. 9. Sacrificia sine serupùlo, &c. Pame∣lius exponit de Missae Sacrificio—At patiantur me liberè dicere, haec ad Sacrificium Missae non pertinere, sed de his mielligi, quae in Ecclesia, sive in Pauperum, sive in Sacerdotum alimenta: cum enim Vxores sine consensu Maritorum non possunt erogare, ait maritatam Christiano sine scrupulo liberalem esse posse, quòd maribus illud concedat. Reliefe of the poore; and which was to be ministred by a Woman the Wife of a Christian. {fleur-de-lys}
Our Eleventh Demonstration, Because the Relatives of Sacrifice, which are Altar and Priest, Objected as Properly taken, are used Vnproperly of Ancient Fathers. SECT. XV. YOur Cardinall his Objection is this; that Priest, Altar, and Sacrifice, are Relatives, and have mutuall and unseparable Dependance one of each other. So hee, and truly. But you ought to take with you a necessary Caution, observed by the sameBellarm.—Sunt Relata, ità ut Sacrifi∣cium propriè dictum Sacerdotio propriè dicto; & Sacrificio impropriè dicto im∣propriè dictum sacer∣dotium respondeant. Lib. 1. de Missa, ca. 2. §. Quintum. Cardinall, that An unproper Sacrifice cannot inferre a proper Priest-hood: nor an unproper Priest-hood a proper Sacri∣fice, &c. otherwise, your Iesuite can tell you of aMaldonat. Ies. Serpens aeneus suit Sacrificium comme∣morativum futuri Sa∣crificij Christi, sed tamen non habuit altare. Lib. de 7. Sa∣crā. Tom. 1. de Euch. §. Quintum genus. Sacri∣fice without an Altar, and yourAbulens. in Ios. 22. Altare hoc non fuerat ad Sacrificium offerendum. Quaest. 9. Bishop can point you out an Altar without a Sacrifice. Wherefore to take one of these improperly, and the other properly, were as wilde Sophistrie, as from a wooden Leg to inferre a body of Flesh. Now what if wee shall say of this Point of Appellations, that It was not so from the Beginning? Hereunto wee claime but your owne common Confessions, viz,Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 17. § Ne∣que.—Ne{que} obstat quod Ministri Eccle∣siastici non diceban∣tur Sacerdotes, aut u∣tebantur nominibus templi, sacrificij. Al∣taris, & similib, quia tempore Apostolorū vigebat Sacerdotium Iudaicum, ideò absti∣nebant abijsdem vo∣cibus, ne viderentur eosdem illos ritus in∣novare. That the Apostles did willingly abstaine from the words of Sacrifice, [Sacerdos,] and Al∣tar. So your Cardinall, andEodem modo Durantus de Ritibus, lib. 1. cap. 1. num. 7. Durantus, the great Advo∣cates for your Romane Masse: whereby they have con∣demned not onely other your Romish Disputers, whoSee above Cha. 3. Sect. 8. have sought a Proofe of a Proper Sacrifice in your Masse from the word Altar, used by the Apostle Paul, Heb. 13. but also them∣selves, who from Saint Luke, Act. 3. []See above Chap. 2. Sect. 1. conclu∣ded a Proper Sacrifice. As if the Apostles had both abstained and not abstained from the words of Priest and Sacrifice. {fleur-de-lys} And againe your Iesuite Lorinus;Lorin. Ies. in Act. 14. 22. de Sa∣cerdote. Ab hoc ab∣stinet novum Testa∣mentum, ut magis proprio antiqui legis Sacrificij, vel Idolo∣rum, concedo. The New Testa∣ment (saith hee) abstained from the word [Graecè, . Sacerdos] as from that which is more Proper to the Old Testament. So hee. Wherefore this and the English word, Priest, having a dif∣ferent Relation, one to a Sacrificing Minister (which is pro∣per to the Old Testament) the other as it is derived from the word [Graecè . Presbyter,] in the New Testament, which is Senior, and hath no Relation to any Sacrificing Function: It must follow, that your Disputers seeking to urge the Sig∣nification of a Sacrificing Office, proper to the Old Testa∣ment, for Proofe of a Sacrificing Act, proper to the New, performe as fond and fruitlesse a labour, as is the patching of old Vestments with new pieces, whereby the rent is made worse. {fleur-de-lys} But the Apostles did indeed forbeare such termes in their
speeches, concerning Christian worship, whereof these your forenamed Disputers can give us a Reason,See the former Testimony at (d.) Lest that (say they) the Iewish Priest-hood being as yet in force, Christians might seeme, by using Iewish Termes, to innovate Iewish Rites. Which is enough to shew, that you are perswaded they abstained from the use of these words for some Reason. Yet that this could not be the Reason, you may be sufficiently instructed in the word, Baptisme, this being as fully Iewish, as was either the word Priest, Altar, or Temple: and yet used of the Apostle without danger of Innovation of the Iewish maner of Baptismes. Yea, and if the Apostles had thought the Altar, Priest, Sacri∣fices, to be essentiall parts of Christian Religion, they neither would nor ought to have concealed the words and names, lest thereby they might have seemed to have abhorred the proper Characters of our Christian Profession. Wee descend to the Fathers. It is not unknowne unto you, how the Fathers delighted themselves, in all their Treatises, with Iewish Ceremoniall Termes, onely by Allegoricall Al∣lusions, as they did with the word Synagogue, applying it to any Christian assembly; as Arke, to the Church; Holocaust, to Mortification; Levite, to Deacons; Incense, to Prayers and Praises; and the word Pascha to the day of the Resurrection of Christ. But if any should say, that these Fathers used any of these words in a proper Signification, hee should wrong both the common sense of these Fathers, and his owne Conscience. It were superfluous to urge many Instances, where one will serve. The word, Altar, applyed to the Table of the Lord (which anciently stood in theEuseb. Hist. lib. 10. cap. 4. Ex O∣rat. Danegyr. Pauli∣no Tyriorum Episco∣po dedicata, qui Basi∣licam ibi construxit. Sanctuario hoc modo absoluto & perfecto, sellisque quibusdam in, altissimo loco ad Praesidum Ecclesiae honorem collocatis, & subsellijs ordine dispensatis—Al∣tarique denique tan∣quàm Sancto San∣ctorum (Gr. ) in medio San∣ctuarij sito, &c.

[These Testimonies verifie the same Assertion of Doctor Falke against Gregory Martin, cap. 17. The Table stood so, that men might stand round aboue it.] Midst of the Chancell; so that They might compasse it round) was more rarely called  of the Greekes, or Altare of the Latines, than , and Men∣sa, that is, Table; which they would not have done, if (Altar) had carryed in it the true and absolute property of an Altar: nay but they used therein the like liberty, as they used to do in August. quaest. super Exod. lib. 2. cap. 9. Altare est populus Dei. Lib. 1. de Serm. in monte. Altare in interiore Dei templò, id est, fides. Lib. 10. de Civitat. Dei, cap. 4. Ejus est Altare cor nostrum. And other Fathers ordinarily. applying the name, Altar, to Gods People, and to a Christian man's Faith and Heart. {fleur-de-lys} All this notwithstanding, you are not to thinke that wee do hereby oppugne the Appellation of Priest and Al∣tar, or yet the now Situation thereof in our Church, for use as Convenient, and for order more Decent; but onely the Romish Opinion and Doctrine, whereby you hold them, in the verie proprietie of words, and not as the Fathers did, onely by way of Allusion. For your better Apprehension
of this Truth, if you will be pleased to observe that Christ, in the time of the first Institution and Celebration of this Sa∣crament, propounded it, in the place where hee, with his Disciples, gave it unto them to be Eaten and Drunken; then tell us where it was ever knowne, that any Altar was ordai∣ned for Eating and Drinking? In Gods Booke wee find, Levit. 9. that the Priests themselves were not permitted to eate their Oblation On, but, Besides the Altar. Neither may you thinke it any Derogation to this Sacrament, that the place, whereon it is Celebrated, is not called an Al∣tar of the Lord, seeing the Spirit of God, by his Apostle, hath dignified it with as equivalent Attributes; for the A∣postle, as hee called this Sacred Banquet purposely The Supper of the Lord, and the Vessell prepared for the Liquid, The Cup of the Lord; so did hee name the place whereon it was set, The Table of the Lord, and the Contemners thereof, Guiltie of the Body and Blood of the Lord; and thereupon did denounce the Vengeance and Plague, which fell upon prophane Communicants, The Iudgement of the Lord: and all these in one Chapter, 1. Cor. 11. The like Difference may be discerned betweene your maner of Reverence, in Bowing towards the Altar for Adoration of the Eucharist onely: and ours in Bowing aswell when there is no Eucha∣rist on the Table, as when there is, which is not to the Table of the Lord, but to the Lord of the Table, to testifie the Com∣munion of all the Faithfull Communicants thereat; even as the People of God did, in Adoring him before the Arke his Footstoole, Psal. 99. 5. and 1. Chron. 28. 2. as Daniels Bowing at Prayer in Chaldea, looking towards the Tem∣ple of Ierusalem, where the Temple of Gods Worship was, Dan. 6. 10. And as David would be knowne to have done, saying, Psal. 5. 7. I will Worship towards thy holy Tem∣ple: Will you suffer us to come home to you? The Father Gre∣gory Nazianzen, for his soundnesse of Iudgement Sirnamed the Divine, comparing this Inferiour Altar, and Sacrifice on earth, with the Body of Christ seated in Heaven, faith that the Sacrifices, which hee offereth in his Contemplation at the Altar in Heaven, areNazian. orat. 28.—Esto, ego pel∣lor ab. Altari in Ec∣clesia: at novi aliud Altare mentis & contemplationis in coelo, ibi adstabo, & Deo offeram Sacrifi∣cia, quae sunt tanto acceptiora, quàm ea quae offerimus ad Al∣tare, quanto pretio∣sior est veritas quàm umbra. More acceptable than the Sacrifices, which are offered at the Altar Below, as much as Truth is more excel∣lent than the Shadow. So hee. Therefore (say wee) the Sa∣crifice of Christ his Body and Blood are subjectively in Heaven, but objectively here in the Eucharist; here Representative only, as in a Shadow, but in Heaven presentatively, in his Bodily pre∣sence. So vainly your Disputers hitherto (whilst that wee re∣quired Materials) have objected against us bare words, phrases, and very shadowes.
Lastly, Cyril of AlexandriaCyril. Alexand. cont. Iulian. lib. 9 (Iu∣lian. Ob.) Iudaei sa∣crificant,—vos autem invento novo Sacrificio—quare non sacrificatis?—illud commune no∣biscum habent, etiam Templa, Altaria, &c. (Resp. Cyril multò post,) Vitae honestas, & ad meliora pro∣pensio est Sacrificium fragrantissimum—Et Paulus hortatur nos exhibere corpora nostra Sacrificium sanctum, rationalem cultum nostrum Deo.—Igitur etsi Iudaei sacrificarent, ut in umbris praecep∣ta implerent, nos ta∣men latâ viâ euntes, ad id quod rectum est veniemus, nempè spiritualem & im∣mortalem cultum proficientes. (Iulian.) Mosi dicitur, septem diebus azymis vesce∣mini: vobis parum est abstulisse. (Cyril. Resp.) Impletur Lex à nobis in azymis, maximè fide justifi∣catis in Spiritu, men∣talem{que} cultum prae∣ponentibus tali mo∣do.—Vnde scribit D. Paulus, ut diem agamus in azymis sinceritatis & verita∣tis. (Rursus, Iulian. ibid. lib. 10) Offerre Sacra in Altari, & sacrificare cavetis. (Resp. Cyril.) Adhi∣bemus Sacrificia spi∣ritualia, scilicet, & mentalia: nam illi ex sanguine offere∣bant boves, & oves,—Et ex fructibus si∣milam, olas, &c. hos tamen tam crasso ministerio relicto renue & subril, at spirituale perficimus: offerimus enim in odorem suavitatis fidem, spem, charitatem, justitiam, laudes, Sacrificium enim secundùm naturam incorporèum de∣cet Deum. (Iulian.) Et Cain obtut Sacrificium de fructibus terrae? Abel de carnalibus. (Cyril. Resp.) Offe∣rimus melius quoddam quàm illi—Sacrificamus enim mentaliter & spiritualiter virtutum fragran∣tias. (Rursus Iulian. Ob.) Non circumcidimini, non Azyma, non Pascha servatis. Non possumus, inquiunt, (viz. Christiani:) pro nobis enim semel immolatus est Christus, & prohibuit Azyma—non Abraham imitantes Altaria etigitis Deo, nec Sacrificatoria aedificatis. (Resp. Cyril.) Circumcisionem habemus Spiri∣tos—In Aymis spirituala quae habemus. (Et ad pascha Resp.) Affulsit veritas, Immolatus est pro nobis Christus Anus verus. made an Answer to the Objections, then published by Iulian the Apostate, against the Truth of Christian Religion. By this conflict betweene these two wits, as it were by the clashing of a Stone and Steele toge∣ther, such a flash of lightning will appeare, as may sufficiently illuminate every Reader, for the understanding of the Iudge∣ment of Antiquity throughout the whole Cause, concerning Bodily Sacrifice. The Apostate objecteth (See the Margin) as an Exception against Christians, that they are not Circumcised, that they use no Azymes, nor keepe the Passeover of the Iewes: albeit, Cain, Abel, and Abraham before the Law, and the Israelites under the Law, and Heathenish Grecians alwayes without that Law, offered Sacrifices unto God. But they (saith Iulian, writing of Christians) erect no Altars unto God, offer no such Sacrifices as were of old, nor invent any new, but say that Christ was once offe∣red for them. This Objection (you see) is pertinent to our Cause in hand, and as consonant will the Answer of the holy Patriarch Cyril be; who to the other points held it Satisfacti∣on enough to say (see againe the Marginalls) That wee Christi∣ans have the spirituall Circumcision of the heart: That wee ob∣serve the spirituall Azymes of Syncerity and Truth: And as for the Passeover, Christ our Passeover was offered up, namely upon the Crosse (for so is it answerable to the words objected by Iulian.) And to the Objection of not erecting Altars, Cyril saith not a word. But what for the point of Sacrifice? Hearken, (wee pray you) Although (saith hee) the Iewes Sacrificed to fulfill Gods Precepts in shadowes, yet wee doing that which is right (meaning the Truth opposite to Shadowes) performe a spirituall, and mentall worship, as namely, Honesty, and an holy Conversation. And againe, The Iewes offered in Sacrifice Bulls and Sheep, first-fruits of the Earth, Cakes, and Frankincense: but wee offer that which is spirituall, to wit, Faith, Hope, Charity, and Praises; because an unbodily Sacrifice is fit for God. And yet againe, Wee Sacrifice to God spiritually, and mentally, the perfumes of virtues. This is the summe of Saint Cyril his Answer, voyd of all mention of any Offering of the Body of Christ, as either Corporally present in the Eucharist to be Sacrificed by the Priest, or yet of any Cor∣porall Touch thereof (by eating) with the Bodies of Commu∣nicants;
no nor any intimation of any Proper Sacrifice profes∣sed by Christians. Here will be no place for your Answer, to tell us that the Question was of Bloody, and not of Vnbloody Sacrifices: No, for Cyril in his Answer handleth as well the unbloody Sacri∣fice of Cain, as the Bloody Oblation of Abel; and expresseth as fully the unbloody Sacrifice of Cakes and Frankincense, as hee doth the Bloody of Sheepe, and Oxen. Neverthelesse, wee should confute our selves, for objecting this Testimony, seeing that the Custome of the Primitive Church being then professedly not to reveale the Mystery of the Sacrament of Baptisme, or of the Eucharist, either to in∣fidels or Catechumenists, and therefore this silence of Cyril, in not so much as mentioning the Sacrifice of the Masse, might seeme to have beene purposely done, to conceale it from Iulian, the Patron of Heathenish worship. So indeed wee should have thought, but that then Iulian and Cyril both would as readily confute us; Iulian, because hee himselfe had beene more than a Catechumenist in the Church of Christ, even (as namely Gre∣gory Nazianzene witnesseth) onceGreg. Nazian. Orat. 3. advers. Iulian. (De Gallo et Iuliano) Quinetiam in Cle∣rum seipsos ascripse∣runt, ut divinós quo∣que libros plebi lecti∣tarent: non minus id sibi amplum & ho∣norificum existiman∣tes quàm aliud quid∣vis, &c. A Reader of Scriptures to the people, not thinking it any Derogation unto him so to do; there∣fore was hee not ignorant of the (then) Christian Doctrine, concerning the Eucharist. And (which is a point as observable) when hee objecteth against Christians want of Sacrifices, by and by, as if Christians had nothing to say for themselves, but that Christ gave up himselfe once; hee expresseth this their An∣swer, as that which hee held not to be sufficient. And Cyril also would controll us, who in his whole Answer (opposing Spirituall to Corporall) defendeth no Sacrifice at all among Christians, but that which hee called Spirituall and Mentall; as for Example, Godly Conversation, Faith, Hope, Charitie, Praises, &c. All which areSee Chap. 5. Sect. 14 excluded out of your Definition of Proper Sacrifice. The Case then is plaine. If that the now Romish Doctrine of a Proper Bodily Sacrifice of Christ's Body, offered up in the hands of the Priest, by an Elevation, and after in Consum∣mating the same by eating it with his Mouth, which you call a Sacrificing Act, had beene Catholike learning in that Age, then assuredly could neither Iulian have challenged Christians for No Sacrifice, nor Cyril have defended them, by confessing indeed No Sacrifice among Christians, but onely Spirituall and Mentall. {fleur-de-lys} And undoubtedly if Materiall Altars (properly so called) had beene in use in Christianitie at that time, the holy Fathers would not have then concea∣led this, especially when as the want of Altars was objected against them, as a note ofOrigen. cont.

CHAP. VI. Our third Examination, which concerneth your Pro∣fession of the Romish Masse, by your Romish Principles. The State of the Question. WEll have you discerned of the two-fold acception of a Proper Sacrifice, which (asBellarm. Sa∣crificium Missae acci∣pitur proprie prore, quae sacrificatur: & etiam accipitur pro∣priè pro actione sa∣crificandi. Lib. 1. de Missa, Cap. 27. §. Resp. ut. you say) Is some∣time taken for the thing sacrificed, and also for the proper sacrificing Act. So your Cardinall: and indeed, both these are necessary in a Proper Sacri∣fice, yet neither of these can possibly be found in your preten∣ded Sacrifice of your Romish Masse. That the Thing, pretended to be Sacrificed, is not Pro∣perly in the Romane Masse. SECT. I. THe things, which your Romish Beliefe professeth to be Sacrificed in your Masse, is the Body and Blood of Christ, corporally extant therein, as the proper Subject thereof. But that there is no Corporall Existence of Christ's Body in the Eu∣charist, was the Conclusion of our second, third, and fourth Bookes. And that the same Body and Blood of Christ is not the proper subject matter of the Sacrifice, used in your Masse, is our Conclusion throughout this whole Booke. Of both which you may have a Synopsis and generall view in the last Booke. Thus of the thing Sacrificed, now that which followeth, concerning your Romish Sacrificing Act, is a Point briefly ex∣pedited by two Propositions. I. That no Act, now used in the Romane Masse, can truly be called a proper Sacrificing Act: proved by your owne Principles. SECT. II. VVHatsoever Sacrificing Act your Advocates have held, as Proper to a Sacrifice; and assumed, as belonging to the Sacrifice of your Masse, have each one beeneSee above Chap. 1. Sect. 5. Confuted by Doctors of your owne, Church of singular estimation; and
rejected as utterly insufficient to prove any Proper Sacrificing Act in the Institution of Christ: to wit, not Elevation, not Fraction, not Oblation, not Consecration, and lastly, not Con∣sumption of the Eucharist by the mouth of the Priest. Non li∣cet actum agere, said one, and Non libet, say wee. But now are wee to discusse such Properties, as are yet awanting in your Ro∣mish Execution. II. That that, which is properly a Sacrificing Act, is wanting in the Romane Masse; proved by your owne Principles. SECT. III. THree Properties are required of you, as necessary to a properly Sacrificing Act, the first is, that the Action be exercised upon a thingConcil. Trid. Christus tradebat vi∣sibile Sacramentum sub specie panis & vini. Sess. 22. et Bel∣larm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27. §. Secundo. Visible. Secondly, that the thing sacrificed be ofSeptimò, ritu mystico consecratur: nam debet res illa, quae Deo offertur, ex profanà fieri sacra. Idem significat Sa∣crificare, quod sacrum facere. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. {fleur-de-lys} Maldonat. de Eu∣charist. pa. 353. No∣stra Sententia est. In eo tantum consistit Sacrificium, quod ex re prophana fiat sa∣cra. {fleur-de-lys} Prophane, made sacred by the Act of Con∣secration. Thirdly, that the Act be aBellar. Octa∣vò, trāsmutatur, quià ad verum Sacrificium requiritur, ut id, quod offertur Deo, plane destruatur, id est, ita mutetur, ut desinat esse id quod antè e∣rat.

Et idem ibid. cap. 4. § Nunc. {fleur-de-lys} Gor∣don. Ies. Controv. 9. cap. 1. nu 25. In Sacrificio propriè dictò necesse est ut adsit res visibilis & permanens, quae offeratur. Et post num. 26. Requirit etiam Interitum & destructionem ejus rei, quae Deo offertur, ut post Thomam bene notat Bellarminus. {fleur-de-lys} Destructive Act, whereby the thing offered be truly destroyed, and cease to be in sub∣stance that which it was. According to your owne objected words,  and  signifying a Consumption; and therein answerable to the Sacrifices of the Old Law, all which suffered Destruction; things living by slaughter, things without life, if solid, by burning; if liquid, by powring out, and shedding, &c. So you in Thesi, wee descend to the Hypothesis. But before wee enter into this Disquisition, wee shall desire you to take unto you the spirits of reasonable men, whilest wee reason the matter with you in few words. First, it cannot be called Properly Visible, which is not Visible in it selfe. But the Body of Christ, which you call the thing sacrificed, is not Visi∣ble in it selfe, but onely (as your Councell ofConc. Trid. and Bellarm above cited, §. 3. at (a.) Trent hath taught) In the forme of Bread; and then, how invisible it is, onely blinde men can be ignorant. Nor will wee thinke All, among you, to be so blinde, seeing that wee heare one (and that a Iesuite) acknowledging his eye-sight, and plainly, without Parables, saying, thatSal∣meron. Christus cruentus, & incruentus, non differunt, sed quod ille visibilis, hic invisibills. Tom 9 Tract. 29. § Iam de. Christ in the Eucharist is in∣visible.
So hee. Therefore the first Property of a proper Sacri∣ficing Subject is wanting in your Romane Masse. Secondly, wee will not judge any of you so blasphemous, as to say, that the Body of Christ, by your Consecration, is of a Prophane thing made sacred, which wee are sure your ancient Romish Schoole did deny; which concluded thatAquinas. Be∣nedictio sacerdotalis fertur super terminū à quo, non super ter∣minum ad quem, i. e. super corpus Christi. In 1. Cor. 10. It is not Christ that is made sacred, by benediction of the Priest, but that which the Priest first taketh in his hands to blesse. And so your Act of Consecration, by defect of the second property; is no proper Sacrificing Act of the Body and Blood of Christ. Thirdly, it will be as incredible even in your owne Iudge∣ments, that the Body of Christ should be properly Destroyed. Wee say, in your owne Iudgements, who therefore are con∣strained to say,Bellar. Cor∣pus Christi per con∣secrationem accepit formam cibi, & ad comestionem & de∣structionem ordina∣tur: & licet nullam laesionem patiatur in se, neque amittit suum esse naturale, sed amittit. Sacra∣mentale Esse, & pro∣inde desinit esse rea∣liter in Altari, & desinit esse cibus sen∣sibilis. Lib. 1. de Mis∣sa. Cap. 27. §. Ter∣tiò. that The Body of Christ indeed suffereth not herein any naturall Destruction, but onely Sacramentall, that is, Metaphoricall. Ergo, your Romish Masse is destitute of the pro∣per Sacrificing Act of Destruction. And againe, whereas the word, Immolation, is taken ofLombardus cum quaeritat, quid Sacerdos gerit, sit dicendum Sacrifici∣um aut Immolatio, accipit nomen Im∣molationis pro oc∣cisione: respondet autem rectissimè, Christum semel tan∣tùm immolatum, id est, occisum fuis∣se, non autem im∣molari, id est, oc∣cidi in Sacramento & repraesentatione. Bellorm. lib. 1. de Missa. cap. 15. Rur∣sus paulò superius. § Ad hanc.—Cruenta Immolatio semel tantùm verè & pro∣priè facta est, nunc autem non propriè, sed pr Repraesentationem. Lib. 4. Dist. 12. §. Post haec. Lombard for being Slaine, or suffering by Death; It was most truly said by him (saith your Cardinall) that Christ is not properly immolated, meaning not slaine, but onely in Representation. Well then, the State of the Question, as your Cardinall himselfe hath set it downe, is (seeing that every Proper Sacri∣fice requireth a Proper Destruction, and, if it be a living Sacri∣fice, a Destruction by death) Whether Christ be properly Sacrificed, or no. Marke, wee pray you, your Cardinal's Re∣solution. His bloody Sacrifice was but once truly and properly done, but now it is not properly done, but by Representation. O Spirit of Contradiction! For, that which is but once onely properly offered, can never be said to be againe properly offered; and that which is a Bloody Oblation, by your owne learning cannot be Vnbloody. And as great an Intoxication is to be seene in your Dispu∣ters, in respect of the other part of the Sacrament touching the Cup: For your Cardinall Alan defendeth a Reall Destruction in this maner;Alanus de Eucharist. lib. 2 cap. 13. In carnis & sanguinis separatione (undè propriè in animalibus mactatio) consistit vis hujus mysterij, ut in eo solo cernatur divinae mortis repraesentatio—sequitur Christum esse praesentem, modò immolatio—quod sunditur in remissione peccatorum: ergo per modum Victimae praesens est, imò Christus hic praesens in∣duit eum modum, quem habuit ut se offerens in Sacrificio Crucis. (Aliquantò post haec.) Propter concomitan∣tiam, de qua superius diximus, in seipso non moritur. In creatures living (saith hee) the thing sa∣crificed must be slaine, and in this slaying by the separation of blood from the Body doth consist all force and virtue of this Mystery, be∣cause Christ is herein, after the maner of Sacrifice, taking upon him the maner of Sacrificing, which hee had in offering himselfe upon the Crosse, by separation of his Blood. So hee. All which
doth inferre a Reall and Proper separation and effusion of Blood; yet immediatly after standeth hee to the Defence of Concomi∣tancie, which teacheth an Vnion of Body and Blood together, in as full a maner as it was in Christ his most perfect estate. But Blood Separated, and Vnited, are as  contrarie as can be. How much better would it beseeme you to confesse plain∣ly and truly with your Costerus, thatCosterus Chri∣stian. Institut. lib. 1. cap. 10. Christus in cruce solus seipsum obtulit per verā san∣guinis effusionem & mortem: hic per Sa∣cerdotem, tanquam ministrum, se offert sine Sanguinis effusi∣one & morte, sed per utrusque repraesen∣tationem. Christ is not offered herewith effusion of Blood, but by a representation thereof. Thus still wee see your owne Doctors come in your most controver∣ted points towards us, albeit as Rowers, looking backwards to their owne purposes and conclusions. CHALLENGE. A Syllogisme will quit the Businesse; as for Example. Every proper Sacrifice is properly Visible, of Prophane is made Sacred, and properly suffereth Destruction. (This is your owne Proposition in each part.) But the Body of Christ, in the Eucharist, is neither properly Visible, nor properly of Prophane made Sacred, nor suffereth any proper Destruction. (This is also your owne Assumption.) Therefore the Body of Christ, in this Sacrament, is not a proper Sacrifice, nor properly Sacrificed. This (except men have lost their braines) must needs be every mans Conclusion. And that so much the rather, because it cannot be sufficient, that Christs Body be present in the Eucharist, to make it a Sacrifice, without some Sacrificing Act. A Sheepe is no Sa∣crifice whil'st it remaineth in the Fold, nor can every Action serve the turne, except it be a Destructive Act: for the Sheep doth not become therefore a Sacrifice, because it is shorne, nor yet can any Destructive Act be held Sacrificing, which is not prescribed by Divine Authority; which onely cun ordaine a Sacrifice, as hath beene confessed. But no such divine ordi∣nance hath hitherto beene proved. Is it not then a miserable case which you are in, to suffer your selves to be deceived by such Mountebankes, who pretend to direct mens Consciences in the Mysteries of Christian Faith, and particularly concerning this high point of Proper Sacrifice? and in the end give no other satisfaction than by meere Riddles of a Visible, not Visible, Consecrated, not Consecrated, Destroyed, and not Destroyed, with Blood separated, and not separated from the Body; and each one spoken of the same Body of Christ. Our last point concerning a proper Sacrifice followeth.
CHAP. VII. Our Fourth Examination is of the Doctrine of PRO∣TESTANTS, in the point of Sacrifice. IN discussion whereof, wee are to consider first the Acts, which are incident unto the Celebration of this Sacrament: and then the Object thereof, which is the true and reall Body of Christ, as it was Sacrificed upon the Crosse. In respect of the Acts wee say, I. That Spirituall Sacrifices, albeit Vnproper, are in one respect more true, and do farre excell all merely Corporall Sacrifices, according to Scripture. SECT. I. WHen Christ called himselfe the True Vine, the True light, the True Bread; in respect of the Naturall Vine, Light, and Bread; Hee taught us to distinguish betweene a Truth of Excellencie, and a Truth of Propriety, by their different Effects. That which hath the naturall property of Bread (al∣though Manna) preserveth but the temporall life, forIohn 6. See above Booke 5. Sect. 6. They ate Manna, and dyed: but the Bread of Excellencie, which is Christs Body, preserveth toIbid. Immortality. It is a good Ob∣servation, which your Canus hath, thatCanus. Quià per Sacrificia legis externae res quaedam spirituales potiores praesignabantur, has omninò res, Sacrifi∣cia, holocausta, hosti∣as sacrae literae ap∣pellant: ut mactatio∣nes brutorum anima∣lium figurae erant mortificationis. Loc. Theolog. lib. 12. cap. 12. §. In secundo. Many spirituall things are called Sacrifices, in Scriptur, because they were prefigu∣red by the outward bodily Sacrifices of the Lambe: as the killing of Beasts were signes of mortification, which is a killing of sinne. So hee. And the thing Archetypally prefigured (you know) is alwayes held more excellent than the figure thereof. First, the Sacrifice of Contrition, Psalm. 51. 17. The Sacri∣fice of God is a Contrite heart. Secondly, of Righteousnesse, Psalm. 4. 5. Offer the Sacrifice of Righteousnesse. And Rom. 12. 1. by Mortification and Vivification, Present your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable Service. Thirdly, the Sacrifice of Prayer and Praise, Hosea 14. 2. Wee will render the Calves of our lips. Fourthly, of Almes-workes, Heb. 13. 16. With such Sacri∣fices God is well pleased. Fifthly, Sacrifice the fruite of Prea∣ching, Rom. 15. 16. That I ministring the Gospell, that the offe∣ring up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctifyed by the holy Ghost. Sixthly, the Sacrifice of Martyrdome, Phil. 2. 17. Yea, and if I be offered up upon the Sacrifice and Service of your faith, &c. Next wee say,
II. That all these Spirituall Acts, although Improperly called Sa∣crifices, yet are they more excellent than all meerely Cor∣porall and Proper Sacrifices; in the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. II. VPon this Contemplation Ancient Fathers have breathed out many divine Ejaculations, for the expressing of the ex∣cellent Prerogatives of Spirituall Sacrifices, in respect of Cor∣porall. Of the Sacrifice of Contritition, thus:Non terrenis, sed spiritualibus est Deo litandum. Tertull. ad∣versus Iudaeos. Gods wrath is to be appeased with Spirituall Sacrifices. AndErant tum Sa∣crificia pro delicto, quae nunc sunt Sacri∣ficia poenitentiae de delicto. Ambros. lib. 3. Epist. 28. They were then Sacrifices for sinne, which are now Sacrifices of Repentance for sinne. AndSpiritus contri∣bulatus.—Ostendit Deus, se velle Sacri∣ficium, non trucidati pecoris, sed contriti pectoris. Aug. de Ci∣vit. Dei. lib. 20. cap. 5. God sheweth hee will not have the Sacrifice of a slaine beast, but of a contrite breast. Of the Sacrifice of Righteous∣nesse, thus;Mundo moriens, ipse est Sacrificium. Idem. Hee that dyeth to the world, is for himselfe a Sa∣crifice. AndTunc corpora pro corporibus; nunc non corpora, sed vitia corporis perimenda. Arnob. cont. Gentes. Then were Creatures slaine to cleanse mens Bo∣dies: but now are men to mortifie their vices:—, &c. Isid. Pelus. lib. 3. Epist. 75. Every one being made a Priest over his owne Body, to over-rule vices. And Illi offerebant oves & boves: nos tam crasso praeterito Sacrificio subtile of∣ferimus, virtutes om∣nigenas: Sacrificium enim minimè carna∣le, secundùm natu∣ram incorpoream, decet Deum. Ambros. [The same which hee hath translated word for word out of Cyril. Alex. cont. Iulian. See above, towards the end of Chap. 5.] They offered those grosse Bodies of sheepe: but wee the more subtile and pure of virtues, because unbloody things best agree with God. AndChrysost. in Gen. Hom. 60. . This is a new and admirable Sacrifice. And Pelusiota. lib. 3. Ep. 75. . The best Sacrifice is to have a pure Minde and a chaste Body. Of the Spirituall Sacrifice of Prayer and Praises unto God, thus;Preces & Gratiarum actiones factae Deo, . Iustin. Dial. cum Tryphone Iudaeo. And another upon that Psal. 68. of David [Canticum laudis plus placet Deo quam novella] observeth in the Hebrew an elegant Allusion, as if it had been sayd, Deo magis placet Schir, quàm Schior, id est, Canticum, quàm vitulus. Bellar. ibid. These are most perfect and onely Sacrifices acceptable to God. Of Preaching the Word of God, thus;Gladio verbi mactans vltia. Hier & rursus in Psal. 26. Hostia jubilati∣onis, hostia praedicationis. Wee slay vi∣ces with the sword of the Word. And of The Function Evange∣licall, Chrys. in Psal. 95. Munus Evangelicum Sacrificium mundum & immaculatum. It is a pure Sacrifice, and immaculate. AndSacrificium praedicationis omnibus aromatibus praestantius. Aug. A Sacrifice sweeter than all Spices. Of Almesworkes, thus; dicunt, vel quòd eâ Deus prae Sacrificijs placere sibi testatur: haec sancta vestis aromata Sactorum est. Chrysost. These God testifieth to be more pleasant unto him, than all the Sacrifices. AndVbi scriptum est, [Misericordiam magis volo quàm Sacrificium] nihil aliud quàm Sacrificiū Sacrificio praelatum intelligi oppor∣tet: quoniam quod ab hominibus appellatur Sacrificium, signum est veri Sacrificij. Aug. lib. 10. de Civit. cap. 5. This is a true Sacrifice, whereof the other Sacrifices are but Signes. Of Martyrdome, thus;Nos templum Dei sumus omnes, cor nostrum altare Dei, cruentas victimas caedimus, quando usque ad san∣guinem pro veritate certamus. Aug. ibid. cap. 4. Wee are Gods Temple, our hearts his Altars: wee then offer up our bloody Sacrifice, when wee contend for the Truth with our Blood. In briefe,Verum Sacrificium est omne opus quod agitur, ut Deo in sancta societate haereamus: relatumque ad illum sinem, ut beati esse possimus, Idem. lib. 10. de Civit. cap. . Every
good worke done, to the end that wee may enjoy God, is a true Sa∣crifice. {fleur-de-lys} Your Cardinall Bellarmine lighting on this Sen∣tence, wherein Saint Augustine defineth a Sacrifice to be every good worke wrought, that wee may in an holy Societie ad∣here unto God:Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Vnum.—Sanctus Aug. lib. 10. de Ci∣vit. Dei, cap. 6. Sic definit Sacrificium: Sacrificium (inquit) est opus omne quod agitur, ut sanctâ so∣cietate inhaereatur Deo, relatum ad illum sinem, ut beati esse possimus. Respondeo, Vocat Opus tale Sacri∣ficium verum, ratione dignitatis & effectus, quod sit praestantius: non ratione formae & essentiae Sacrificij propriè dicti. This Saint Augustine spoke (saith your Cardinall) not properly, according to the essence of a Sacrifice, but in respect of the dignitie and effects of every such worke. So hee. {fleur-de-lys} Hitherto of our Proposition, by the Deter∣mination of holy Fathers. In the next place wee say, for the Assumption, III. That Protestants professe, in their Celebration, divers Sacrifices of chiefe Excellencie. SECT. III. COrporall and Spirituall Sacrifices are by you distinguished, calling the first, Proper, and the other Improper; but the Spirituall excelleth by infinite Degrees, as you have heard. In which kinde Protestants, in their Celebration, professe foure sorts of Sacrifices. For proofe hereof, wee may instance in our Church ofIn the English Liturgia. England, most happily reformed and establi∣shed. First, the Sacrifice of Mortification in Act, and of Martyr∣dome in Vow, saying, [Wee offer unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our soules, and bodies, to be an holy, lively, and reasonable Sacrifice un∣to thee.] Next, a Sacrifice Eucharisticall, saying, [Wee desire thy fatherly goodnesse mercifully to accept of our Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving.] And why may wee not, with the Scrip∣ture, call this a Sacrifice? seeing that your Bishop Iansenius held it for an Argument of proving Christ to have offered a Sacrifice, evenIansen. Christū in coena Sacrificium obtulie, primū qui∣dem satis est signifi∣catum, cum dicitur Gratias egisse: Gra∣tiarum enim actio est quoddam Sacrificium, à qua Christi actione Sacramentum corpo∣ris & sanguinis Do∣mini nomen illud ab initio Ecclesia acce∣pit. Concord. cap. 131. Because hee gave Thanks: giving of Thanks being a kinde of Sacrifice. So hee. Thirdly, a Sacrifice Latreu∣ticall, that is, of Divine worship, saying, [And although wee be unworthy to offer up any Sacrifice, yet wee beseech thee to accept of our bounden duty and service, &c.] This performance of our Bounden Service is that, whichSee above Chap. 3. Sect. 5 Ancient Fathers called an Vnbloody Sacrifice. Nor is our Church of England alone in this Profession: this Truth wee referre unto the Report of yourBellarm.

Canus, by whom you may understand the agreement
betweene them, whom you name Lutherans, in their Augu∣stane Confession, and of Calvin; by acknowledging not some one Act, but the whole worke of this Celebration (according to the Institution of Christ) both in Communication, Commemora∣tion, and Representation of his Death, with Praise and Thanksgi∣ving, to be a Sacrifice Eucharisticall: And also (to use the words of Calvin) Latreuticall, and Sebasticall, that is, a Sacri∣fice of Worship and Veneration; which every Christian may and must professe, who hath either eyes in his head, or faith in his heart: the Celebration of this Sacrament, in Remem∣brance of his absolute Sacrifice of our Redemption, being the Service of all Services that wee can performe to God. Now wherein, and in what respect wee may furthermore be said to offer to God a Sacrifice propitiatory, improperly, will after appeare, when wee consider Christ's Body as the Object heerein. That Protestants in their Commemoration offer up the same Bo∣dy and Blood of Christ, which was Sacrificed on the Crosse, as the Object of Remembrance, and most absolute Sacrifice of our Redemption: which is partly justified by the Romish Masse it selfe. SECT. IV. NOw wee are come to the last, most true, and necessary Point, which is the Body and Blood, as the Object of our Commemoration. Still, still do you urge the Sayings of Fathers, where they affirme that wee offer unto God The same Body and Blood of Christ, on this Altar, even the same which was sacri∣ficed on the Crosse; which therefore you interpret as being the same subject matter of our Commemoration, As is a King acting himselfe upon a Stage, as hath beeneSee above Chap. 5. Sect. 7. shewen. Wee as instantly, and more truly, proclame that wee offer (Commemoratively) the same, undoubtedly the very same Body and Blood of Christ his All-sufficient Sacrifice on the Crosse, al∣though not as the Subject of his Proper Sacrifice, but yet as the only adequate Object of our Commemoration; (as the Emperour Mauritius is sayd to be represented in a Stage-play) wherein wee cannot possibly erre, having Truth it selfe for our Guide, who said, Do this in remembrance of mee, namely, of the same [Mee;] meaning Christ, as crucified on the Crosse, as the Apo∣stle commenteth, saying, Hereby you shew the Lords Death till hee come, even the Same Body, as the Same Death; whereunto beare all the Fathers witnesse, throughout this Treatise. Wee say againe, for your better Observation, the Same Body, as the Same Death: but it cannot be the Same Death, but objectively onely.
Ergò, can it not be the Same Body, but onely Objectively. Whereby it will be easie for us to discerne the subject Sacrifice of Christ from ours, his being the Reall Sacrifice on the Crosse, ours onely the Sacramentall Representation, Commemoration, and Application thereof. {fleur-de-lys} For your better satisfaction, Wee exhibit unto you the ancient Practise of your Romish Church, in the Service of the Masse, celebrated every Saturday in the Passion-weeke; where∣in (as yourBellar.

Feriâ sextâ majoris hebdomadae non ce∣lebratur Missae sacri∣ficium: quāvis in illa Actione dicat Sacer∣dos, [Orate, Fratres, ut et meum et vestrū Sacrificium &c.] Et paulò antè; [Sic fiat Sacrificium nostrū in conspectu tuo, ut pla∣ceat Tibi, Domine Deus.] In his duobus lotis vox, Sacrificiū, non videtur propriè accipienda, sed largo modo pro tota ista Actione. Et quòd in ista feria Missa non propriè celebretur, le∣gimus in Ordine Ro∣mano antiquissimo. &c. Cardinall doth certifie you and us) the Priest, in your Missall, Prayeth twice to God to receive [His Sacrifice:] although it be, properly, but onely a Sacrament, the whole Action thereof being called a Sacrifice. So hee, even as di∣rectly for our purpose, as wee could wish; hereby justi∣fying our Calling the Whole Celebration of the Eucharist (albeit Properly a Sacrament onely) a Sacrifice, in a Large and qualified Sense, according to the Practise of ancient Fathers; as wee have proved throughout the whole Sixt Booke, by Eleven Demonstrations.{fleur-de-lys} CHAP. VIII. Of the Second Principall part of this Controversie, which concerneth the Romish Sacrifice, is as it is cal∣led Properly Propitiatory. THis part is divi∣ded into an 1. Explication of that which you call Propitiatory. 2. Application thereof, for Remission of Sinnes. The State of the Question of Propitiatory, what it is. SECT. I. THe whole Difference standeth upon this, whether the sub∣ject matter of our Representation in the hands of the Priest be Properly a Propitiatory Sacrifice, or no. Now Propitiatory is either that which pacifieth the wrath of God, and pleaseth him by it's owne virtue and efficacie, which (as all confesse) is onely the Sacrifice of Christ in his owne selfe; or else a thing is said to be Propitiatory and pleasing to God, by God's Gracious acceptance and indulgence. The Romish professe the Sacrifice of their Masse to be such, in the proper Virtue of that which the Priest handleth. For the Tridentine Faith, concerning your
Propitiatory Sacrifice, is this, viz.Synod. Trid. Sacrificium verè pro∣pitiatorium—Hu∣jus oblatione placa∣tur Deus, gratiam & donum poenitentiae concedens dimittit peccata, una enim eademque hostia est, idem nam offerens Sacerdotum mini∣sterio, qui seipsum in cruce obtulit. Sess. 22. cap. 2. It is that whereby God being pacified doth pardon sinnes. And least that there might be any ambiguity, how it doth pacifie God, whether by his gracious Acceptance, or the Efficacie of offering, your generall Romane Chatechisme, authorized both by your Councell of Trent, and the then Pope Pius the fift, for the direction of your whole Church, instructeth you all, con∣cerning your Sacrifice of the Masse, thatCatechis. Rom. (Jussu Conc. Trident. & Pij Quinti Pont. editus.) Vt Sacrifi∣cium est, non solum merendi, sed & sa∣tisfaciendi quo{que} ef∣ficaciam habet. De Euch. num. 55. Oseri∣us Ies. Conc. Tom. 4. de Missae Sacrificio, in Psalm. 4. [Sacrificare Sacrificium.] Vnicum hoc Sacrificiū est Sa∣crificium laudis, gra∣tiarum actionis, ex∣piatorium & satisfa∣ctorium pro peccatis, & impetratorium pro vivis & defunctis Ita tradit Conc. Trid. As it is a Sacri∣fice, it hath an Efficacie and Virtue, not onely of merit, but also of satisfaction. So they, as truly setting downe the true nature of a Propitiatory Sacrifice, as they do falsly assume and apply it unto the Sacrifice of your Masse; which Protestants abhorre and impugne as a Doctrine most Sacrilegious; and onely grant the Celebration to be Propitiatory (Improperly) by God's Complacencie and favourable acceptance, wherewith hee vouchsafeth to admit of the holy Actions and Affections of his faithfull. Tryall of all this is to be made by Scriptures, and Fathers, by your owne Romish Principles, and by the Doctrine of Prote∣stants. In the Interim, be it knowne that our Church of Eng∣land in her 31. Article, saith of your Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Masse, as it is taught by you, that it is A Blasphemous Fable, and Dangerous Deceit. That the Romish Propitiatory Sacrifice hath no foundation in the Institution of Christ. SECT. II. YOur onely Objection is, that Christ, in the words of his first Institution, said, Take, this is the New Testament in my Blood, shed for you and for many, for the Remission of sinnes. Heare your Cardinall,Bellarm. Se∣cundum Argumentū sumitur ex his verbis Institutionis, quae a∣pertissimè docent, Christum obtulisse in coena pro peccatis A∣postolorum Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Secun∣dum. These words do most evidently teach, that Christ now in his Supper offered up his Blood for the sinnes of his Apostles. So hee. But if this his Exposition of Christ's word's be most evident, alas! what a number of other blinde Guides, of great estimation among you, hath your Church fa∣voured, pampered; privileged, and authorized, who could see nothing in the words of Christ, but the flat contrary▪ (namely) that they were Spoken in the Present Tense (Tropical∣ly) For the Future, not that it was then shed, but that it was to be shed on the Crosse immediately after; among whom haveSee above. Chap. 1. Sect. 2. beene reckoned Gregory de Valentia, Salmeron, Barradas, Vasquez, and Suarez, five prime Iesuites, your Bishop Iansenius, yea and the Author of your Vulgar Translation, and the Authori∣zers thereof. And that you may the better discerne, how hard the fore∣heads
heads of your Cardinall, of your Rhemists, of Master Brerely, and of such others are, who have made that Objection, you have beene likewise advertised, that in the very tenour of your owne Romish Masse it selfe, the word is expresly [In the  place. Effundetur] It shall be shed: Wee say in the Tenour of your Romish Masse, published by the Authority of Pope Pius the fift, repeated by every one of your selves, (you being Romish Priests) and ac∣cordingly believed of all the Professors of your Romish Reli∣gion. Which Interpretation was furthermore confirmed by See above, 1. Sect. 3. Fathers, and by Scripture (in the places objected) and by a Reason taken from your owne Generall Confession, granting that Christ his Blood was not Really shed in his last Supper. This is that which wee had to oppose unto that your Cardinals Most evident Argument, as Sun-shine to Moone-light. That many things are said to pacifie and please God, which are not properly Propitiatory, by their owne Virtue, according to criptures and your owne Confessions. SECT. III. IN Scripture, our Mortification of the flesh is called a Sacri∣fice well-pleasing to God. Rom. 12. 1. Almes, Workes of Charity, are likewise called Sacrifices, wherewith God is deligh∣ted, Heb. 13. 16. Comforting, and cherishing the Ministers of God, is called A Sacrifice acceptable, and well-pleasing to God, Phil. 4. 18. So the Scripture. And that spirituall Sacrifices are more pleasing unto God, than all the Hecatombs of Corporals could be, is a Confession, which wee will take from the quill of Valentia the Jesuite, saying thatValent. Om∣nes actiones rectae rectè propitiare De∣um aliquâ ratione censeri debent. Lib. 2 de Missa, cap. 5. Idem. Peculiari ratione Pre∣cibus propitiandi vis in Scriptura tribuitur, quaten{us} beneficia di∣vina ex misericordia Dei, per illas impe∣tramus. Ibid. All right and just Actions may be said, in some sort, to bee Propitiatory, and to pacifie God. As likewise of Prayer; Scripture (saith hee) attributeth a Propitiatory force un∣to Prayers, so farre forth as wee obtaine many Blessings of God, through his mercie, by them. So hee. Which confirmeth our former Distinction of Propitiatory, by the mercifull Accepta∣tion of God, distinct from your Propitiatory, which is of me∣ritorious Satisfaction by its owne virtue: which meere man must let alone for ever. Thus of our Examination from Scrip∣ture. The Doctrine of Ancient Fathers, concerning a Propitiatory Sacrifice. SECT. IV. ALbeit our Premises in the former part of this Controver∣sie touching Sacrifice, and proving both by Scripture and
ancient Fathers, that the Eucharist is not properly a Sacrifice, might give a Supersedeas to all your further contending by their Authority, for Defence of a Sacrifice properly Propitiatory; be∣cause that which is not properly a Sacrifice, can no more be a Sacrifice properly Propitiatory, than that which is not properly a stone can be properly called a Mil-stone: Notwithstanding, wee would be loath to be indebted unto you for an Answer to your objected Fathers, in this Point also. The Objections, which you use and urge, are of two kindes: some, wherein there is no mention of the Body and Blood of Christ at all; and the other sort such, wherein they both are named and ex∣pressed. CHAP. IX. That the objected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers might well be understood to call the Celebration of the Eucha∣rist A Propitiatory Sacrifice, in respect of divers Spirituall Acts therin, without any Conceit of a Proper Virtue of Propitiation it selfe. SECT. I. A Propitiatory in Gods mercifull acceptance wee de∣fend, but not in Equivalencie of Valour and Vir∣tue in it selfe. First, as it is an Act commanded by Christ, in which sense your IesuiteSee above, Chap. 8. Sect. 3. Valentia saith, that Every right Act is in a sort Propitiatory. Secondly, as it is a godly Act, wherby wee do affiance our soule to God, Every good worke, (asAugust. See above, Cha. 5. Sect. 8. Augustine saith) which is done that wee may adhere unto God, is a True Sacrifice. Thirdly, as it is an Act serving peculiarly to Gods worship, for Religiousnesse is that (saidChrysost. ibid. Chrysostome) wherewith God testifieth himselfe to be well pleased. Fourthly as it is an Act of Commemoration and Representation of that onely properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse, wee must grant to your Cardinall, that Commemoration alone hath not any Propitious Efficacie in it selfe: But yet by the Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ, resembled thereby, God vouchsafeth to be Propitious unto us; in which respectOrigen. in Le∣vit. Hom. 13. Si re∣deas ad illum quem Deus proposuit Pro∣pitiatorem per fidē, & si respicias ad illā commemorationem, de qua dicit Domin{us}, Hoc facite in com∣memorationem mei; ista est sola comme∣moratio, quae propi∣tium facit hominibus Deum. Origen exhorting Christians to resort unto Christ, whom God hath made a Propitiation through faith in his Blood, and also to reflect upon the Commemoration which was commanded by Christ, saying, Do this in remembrance of mee:
This (saith Origen) is the only Commemoration which maketh God propitious. If any would say, how then shall wee not make Commemora∣tion to be Propitiatory in it selfe? Wee answer, as a man hol∣ding in his hand a precious Iewell, which is inclosed in a Ring of gold, and putting it on his finger to preserve him from a Convulsion, the Preservative Virtue is not attributed to the Ring, but to the Iewell; and yet wee say, the Ring is the only meanes to us, which maketh the finger capable of that Virtue. So say wee, Christ his owne Sacrifice, which was the onely precious Subject matter of our Redemption, is made now, by our Remembring, the Object of our Commemoration and Appli∣cation of it, for our Remission and Iustification. Nor is Origen alone in this, but all they (who wereSee Chap. 5. Sect. 11. many) whom you have heard saying that Christs Death and Passion, yea his Bloody Body is offered herein. Your owne Iesuit Salme∣ron is witnesse unto us (for the Councel of Ephesus, Eusebius, and Saint Augustine) thatSalmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 31. §. Postremò superest. pa. 238. Quidā Patres judicant inprimis hâc hostiâ expiari pecca∣ta, quòd cruentū me∣moret Sacrificium. Hanc dicendi ratio∣nem sequitur Concil. Ephes. in Ep. ad Ne∣storem, Euseb. in De∣monst. Evang. lib. 1. cap. 10. August. in Psal. 75. They declared us to have expiation of our sinnes by this Sacrifice, because the bloody Sacrifice of Christ is remembred and commemorated herein. That wee say nothing of our Supplications and Prayers, by which, through the same Virtue of Christs Propitiation, wee obtaine pardon and Remission of sinnes (whether for Quicke and Dead, belongeth not to this Dispute, because whether so or so, they are but Supplicatious still) together with many other saving Blessings from God. Nor of the Act of Thanksgiving, (from which this Sacrament is called the Eucharist) because this is the destinate end of our Celebration, and therefore of all our spiritual Sacrifices most acceptable unto God, for which causeSee above Chap. 5. Sect. 8 Iustine Martyr called it, by the way of Excellencie, , that is, The onely gratefull Sacrifices. Last∣ly, in respect of our Application it selfe, whereof in the next Section. That the Ancient Fathers called it a Propitiatory Sacrifice Obje∣ctively, for the Application of the Properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Crosse, made by the faithfull in Celebration of the Memory thereof. SECT. II. WHen it was asked, why the Ancient Fathers called Bap∣tisme a Sacrifice, it was answered,See above Chap. 5. Sect. 13. at the Letter (c). Because the Sacri∣fice of Christs Death was applied unto us thereby. Yet that Death, truly and onely properly Propitious, is but onely objectively offered in Baptisme. The same may be said of the Eucharist,
whereof your owne great Schoole-man, and BishopCanus. Satis est ut vere & propriè sit Sacrificium, quod mois Christi ita nunc ad peccati re∣missionē applicetur, ac si nunc ipse Chri∣stus moreretur, id quod Scriptorum ve∣terum testimonijs cō∣firmatur.—August. Semel immolatus in seipso Christus, & ta∣men quotidiè immo∣latur in Sacramento. Paschasius: Quotidiè Christus mysticè pro nobis immolatur, & passio ejus in myste∣rio traditur. Et Cy∣rillus in Conc. Ephes. Athanas. ad Antioch. Theophyl. in Hebr. cap. 10. Greg. demū Nazian. (ut caeteros omittam) hanc in∣cruentam Immolati∣onem vocant. Loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. §. Illud. pag. 422. Canus saith, that It is sufficient that the Eucharist be called a proper and true Sacrifice, because the Death of Christ is applyed thereby, as if he were now dead. Marke, As if hee were now dead, which can be but Objectively onely, and which (as you all know) is not your Priestly Sacrifice. As for the Ancient Fathers, who in their objected Testi∣monies talked of ChristCyril. My∣stag. 5. Christum ma∣ctatum offerimus, ut Deum propitiū red∣damus. Ob. per Bel∣larm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 2. Greg. Nyssen. orat. 1. de Resur. & Theoph. in Matth. Dicunt inactationem esse in hac oblatione, &c. Suffering, being slaine, and dying in the Eucharist; Wee Protestants subscribe to their Iudgements with a full faith, in acknowledgement that Christs Death, the proper worke of our Propitiation, is the onely Object of our Remembrance and Faith: which sayings of the Fathers (saith yourSalmeron. Quod benignè interpretan∣dum—nimirùm, mactationem antiquam Christi in cruce inveniri, non novam & realem ab eâ distinctam. Si in coena mactatus erat, quomodo ad nonam horam diei usque sequentis vixit? absurda haec sunt, & aliena à ve∣ritate. Tom. 9. Tract. 31. §. Quartò. Iesuite) must be understood Sacramentally, to signifie the reall slaughter of Christ offered by him upon the Crosse. So hee. Which againe proveth our Conclusion, that they understood a Propitiatory Sacrifice onely objectively in the Eucharist. Wee will end with the objected Testimony of Ambrose, thus, Ambros. Hic imago, veritas in coelestibus, nunc Christus offertur, sed offertur quasi homo, quasi recipiens passionem. Offert se ipse, quasi Sacerdos, ut peccata nostra dimittat, hic in imagine, ibi in veritate ubi apud Patrem. Lib. 1. de offic. cap. 48. Here is an Image offered [Quasi, that is] as it were a man, as it were suffering a Passion, offering himselfe as it were a Priest, that he may forgive our sinnes. And of his now beingSee above, Cha. 3. Sect. 8. at the letter (c). elsewhere hee saith, The truth is in Heaven, there is Hee in truth with the Father. So hee. Whereby is confuted your Conclusion of a Subjective Body of Christ present herein, from [Quasi homo offertur:] for this any one may perceive to be but a Quasi Ar∣gument for a Corporall presence, and to make fully for our Di∣stinction and Defence thereby. Enough of the Iudgement of Antiquity. Our third Examination followeth. CHAP. X. Of the pretended Romish Propitiatory Sacrifice, confu∣ted by Romish Principles, as destitute of foure Properties of Propitiation. THe first is the Imperfection of the Sacrificer. The next, the no-proper Destruction of the thing sa∣crificed. The third, the Vnbloodinesse of the same. And the last, the but-finite Virtue and va∣lue, which you attribute unto it.
I. Confutation, from the confessed Imperfection of the Sacrifice. SECT. I. FIrst the Reason, why you account your Propitiatory Sacrifice to be but of finite Virtue, isBellar. Ratio 2. Quare Sacrificium Crucis sit tanti valo∣ris, hoc autem siniti, sumitur ex parte of∣ferentis: nam Sacri∣ficio Crucis ipse oste∣rens est fillus Dei per se 3 at in Sacrificio Missae est ipse offe∣rens per Ministrum.—Illa actio imme∣diatè producta à di∣vino supposito, ipsa ab humano. Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 4. Because it is not immediate∣ly offered up by Christ himselfe, as that was of the Crosse, but by his Minister. And the Reason of this, you say, is,Salmeron. Ies. Modò Christus in Eucharistia personā induit rei oblatae: & quamvis Christus of∣ferat per Sacerdotes, ut Administros ejus, tamen virtus & causa universalis pro ratio∣ne causae secundariae operatur. Sacerdos igitur ejus nomine induit personam of∣ferentis. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. pag 266. de Missis privatis. Because the Vniversall Cause worketh according to the limitation of the second Causes. So you. Vnderstanding, by Sacrifice, not the Object of your Remembrance, which is the Body of Christ, as cru∣cified; but the Subject matter, in the hand of the Priest. From whence this Consequence must issue, whether you will or no, (namely) that Perfection of the Sacrifice being a necessary pro∣pertie of a true Propitiatory Virtue and efficacie, in prevailing with God for man, it is impossible for any of your Priests (because All are imperfect) to offer up Properly a Propitiatory Sacrifice unto God. None may hereupon oppose unto us the Propitiatory Sacrifi∣ces under the Law, because they also were twice imperfect; once in respect of the Sacrificer, who was but a meere man: and se∣condly, in respect of the matter of Sacrifice it selfe, which was some unreasonable beast, and had no Virtue of Propitiation in it selfe, for remission either of guilt, or of the eternall punish∣ment of sinne, as hath beeneSee above, Chap. 5. Sect. 4. Confessed; and therefore not Properly Propitiatory, but Figuratively; onely as Types of the Sacrifice of Christ. II. Confutation, from the Romish Definition of a Propitiatory Sacrifice. SECT. II. SEcondly, in yourBellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. See above, Chap. 6. Sect. 3. Romish definition, it is required that the Thing propitiatorily sacrificed suffer a Reall Destruction, (so that it cease to be in the substance thereof) and a Bodily Consumption. Notwithstanding you are absolutely free from the Blasphemy, to say that Christ his Body doth in the Eucharist suffer properly a Reall Destruction. Ergo, say wee, by your owne Principle there cannot be herein a Sacrifice properly Propitiatory.
III. Confutation, from the Apostles Position, against the Vnbloodinesse thereof. SECT. III. THe Apostles Position is this, that Without the shedding of Blood there is no Remission, Heb. 9. 22. Your Romish As∣sumption is; The Sacrifice of the Romish Masse is unbloody. Our Conclusion necessarily followeth, which is this; Ergo, say wee, your Masse-Sacrifice cannot be properly Propitiatory. Your Cardinall, in Answering first that theLoquitur Apo∣stolus de Sacrificijs veteris Legis,—Po∣test etiam absolutè & genetatim ccipi, quod quotiescunque fit remissio; fit san∣gumis effusio: sed non nisi virture effu∣sionis sive nunc fa∣cta, sive post futura. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 25. §. Ad illud. Apostle spake this of the Sacrifice of the Old Law onely, standeth twice con∣victed of a foule Tergiversarion; first, by the Apostles Ex∣plication of himselfe, who although hee spake from the obser∣vation of the Old Testament, Heb. 9. 22. yet doth he apply it to the state of the New Testament, in the same Chapter, vers. 13, 14. But much more by his owne Conscience, who having spent some Chapters, in proving that the Sacrifices of the Law were Types of the Sacrifice in the Masse, doth now deny that this Proposition of [No Remission of sinnes without sheedding of Blood] is to be applyed to the Eucharist. Hee is glad therefore to adde a second Answer, given by your Maldonate, who finding no security in the former Refuge, betaketh himselfe to another, saying thatSi accommode∣mus ad Evangelium, dicendum est, pecca∣ta nunc remitti, non propter praesentem effusionem, sed per prae eritam. Maldon. Ies. lib. de 7. Sacram. Tract. de Euch. im∣mediatè ante exitum. Tom. 1. Remission of sinnes is not now for any present effusion of Blood, but for that effusion which had been. Which Answer (if wee may so interpret it) is a plaine Preva∣rication. The Reason may be this; because there was never Bloody Sacrifice (Christ on the Crosse excepted, which onely was of infinite virtue, as well to times past, as to come) but it was alwayes actually by the Effusion of Blood at the time of Sacrificing. These kindes of so ordinary Doublings and Tur∣nings, which your Disputers use, as men in a maze, do plainly Demonstrate either their irresolute Iudgements, or else their dissolute Consciences; and in either of both their despe∣rate Cause. Wee have not done yet, but give you further to understand, that as you could finde no proper Sacrificing Act, to make your Masse properly a Sacrifice, so neither can ye shew any propi∣tiating Act, to make it properly a Sacrifice propitiatory. This wee prove out of your Councel of Colen, whichSi respicimus corpus Christi, quod continetur in Euch. quis negat esse propi∣tiatorium, non ratio∣ne oblationis, quam Sacerdos facit, sed ratione Oblationis factae in cruce? Conc. provinc. Colon. de Missa. fol. 105. And a little after, Non propitiatorium, rati∣one Sacrificij, quod est situm in actione Sacerdoris, seu Mislae communicātum, aut Ecclesiae: sed ratione Sacrificij, quod in cruce oblatum. Conclu∣deth, that your Masse-Sacrifice cannot be called Propitiatory, in respect of any Act of Oblation of the Priest, or accommodation of the Communicants, or yet of the Church: but onely of the Oblation once made by Christ himselfe on the Crosse. Which ob∣lation how absent it is, who seeth not, that is present with him∣selfe? Thus were those Divines driven to an Objective Act of Oblation.
IV. Confutation, from the Romish Disvaluation of that which they call Christ's Sacrifice. SECT. IV. THe last is in respect of the value, for Christ's Sacrifice on the Crosse you do Christianly esteeme to have beene of Mium non est, si cum Christus infinitus extitit, ejus hostia suit infiniti meriti & satisfactio∣nis. Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. pag. 265, 266. Infinite merit and satisfaction, because it was offered by him∣selfe, God and man: and that otherwiseErat infini∣ti valoris: nec enim aliter potui compen∣sari injuria Deo fa∣cta. Ribera Ies. in Heb. 10. num. 19. Hee could not have made satisfaction to an Infinite and Divine Majestie. So you. But of the Sacrifice of the Masse, what▪ The common opinion of our Church (saith yourValor Sacrificij Missae est initus. Haec est communis sen∣tentia Theologorum: in quo distinguitur à Sacrificio Crucis—quod infinitae virtutis erat, & nun∣quam reptitur. Bellarm. Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 4. §. Quarta Prop. [And yet it is knowne that Cardinall Cjetane, Canus, and Scotus were of a contrarie opinion:] To this last Testimony of Bellarme adde also Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. §. Tertiò. Cardinall) is that it is but of finite value. So hee. Notwithstanding it be impossible for any thing of finite virtue to have power in it selfe of remission of an infi∣nite guilt against an infinite Majesty. CHALLENGE. A More palpable betraying therefore of a Cause there can∣not be, than (as you have hitherto done) by defending Positions repugnant to your owne Definition, and by obtru∣ding things as proper, which are voyd of all due Properties. This being all one, as if you, in the Case of Miracles, would deliver unto us a Iannes and Iambres, in stead of Moses; in Art, Sophistry for Logike; in Commerce, , that is, adulterate Coine for current; and in warlike stratagems, instead of a na∣turall, a Trojane Horse. Oh what a misery it is to reason with such unreasonable (to speake mildly) men! Thus much of your Romish Sacrifice, according to your owne Explanations thereof.
CHAP. XI. Of the Romish Application of their Sacrifice. The State of the Question. THat the Eucharist was ordained of Christ, for the Application of remission of sinnes Sacramen∣tally to all Communicants, is the profession of all Protestants. That the Sacrifice of Christs Crosse is therein offered up Objectively, by Commemoration and Supplication, for all Con∣ditions of men, hath an universall Consent among them, with∣out Exception. But that any substantiall Body, as Subjectively contained in the Masse, can be the Sacrifice of applying the merits of Christ for remission of sinnes, (which is yourConc. Trid. Vt visibile Sacrifici∣um—quo crenti Sacrificij virtus in re∣missionem peccato∣rum applicaretur. Sess. 22. cap. 1. Tri∣dentine faith) hath beene hitherto impugned and infringed tho∣rowout our whole former Dispute. Furthermore our present Opposition is three-fold; First, concerning the sinnes that are said to be remitted. Secondly, touching the parties, who have Remission. Thirdly, in regard of your Priests, by whom Ap∣plication of Remission of sinne is made. I. That the Church of Rome is not yet resolved of the Extent of the Virtue of her Sacrifice of the Masse, for remission of sinnes or Punishment. SECT. I. NEver can there be any true Application of the Passion of Christ for remission of sinnes (say wee) which is not abso∣lute, but onely partiall. Your IesuitRibera. Ies. Quoniam quotidiè peccamus, quotidiè virtutem passionis Christi participa∣mus, quod Conc. Trid. docuit, quo cruentum illud, se∣mel in cruce peragen∣dum, repraesentare∣tur, atque salutais ejus virtus in remissi∣onem peccatorum ∣orum, quae quotidrè à nobis committuntur, applicaetur. Et hc Catholicis quidem hominibus manifestissimum est, Haeretici negare non possunt, quoniam Scripturae vrbis a∣pertissimè comptobatur de virtute passionis, ad omnia peccata tollenda, Rom. 3. & 5. [Apoc. 1 1. Ioh. 2. Com. in Heb. 1. 10. num. 16. Ribera seemeth to come on roundly towards us, and friendly to joyne hands with us in this point of Application of an absolute Remisson of sinnes, pretending that this was decreed in the Councell of Trent, as in∣deed it seemeth to have beene, and that from the Authority of Scripture; and hee addeth, that Protestant (whom hee is plea∣sed to grace with the name ofSee the last Testimony. Heretikes) do not deny this ma∣nifest Truth. So hee. Do you marke? a Truth, a manifest Truth, a Truth said to be confirmed by your last Councel, and a Truth con∣sented unto by the Heretikes, as being a manifest Truth. Who would not now looke for a Truth universally professed
in your Church without all exception? But behold (even since that Councell of Trent) your greatly approved Melchior Canus steppeth forth with a peremptory Contradiction, saying, that to holdOpinio pri∣ma. Omnes culpas mortales, & omnia peccata (post Baptis∣mum commissa) per Sacrificium Altaris—sic vult Catharinus—Haec opinio non vera, nisi omnes Theologi fallantur. Canus loc. Theol. lib. 12. pag. 432. 433. All mortall sinnes to be remitted by the Application of the Sacrifice in the Masse, is false, except all Divines be deceived. So hee, speaking of the Divines of the Romish Church. And so may every Papist receive as much remission of his sinnes by holy Water sprinckled at the Church doore, as hee can by the Sacrifice at your Masse. Your Iesuit Valentia noteth, among you, another sort of Do∣ctors, maintaining that your Masse-Application serveth onely forValent. Ies.

That the Ancient Fathers never taught any Application of Christs Passion, but that which is for a Plenary Remission of sinnes. SECT. II. CArdinallAlan. Card.

Ibid. pag. 626. Alan hath put into our hands a consent of some Fathers, for proofe of an Application for remission of all sinnes, for which Christ died. The Fathers whom hee produceth, are these, Chrysostome, Theophylact, Cyprian, and Origen. If these will not suffise, you may take unto you these Calix—sive medicamentum & holocaustum ad sanandas infirmitates, & purgandas ini∣quitates. Cyprian. de Coena Domini.

What needeth it? seeing that the same Cardinall further saith, There is found
no Father to the contrary. Thus much of the Application, which is to be made by this Sacrament; the next is, For whom. That the Romish Vse of a singular Application of the Sacrifice of the Masse to Non-Communicants, because of their present Attendance, is repugnant to the Doctrine of Antiquity. SECT. III. THe Greeke and Latine Churches anciently made up the whole Catholike Church. The Greeke pronounced an , that is, Be-gone, to all Non-Communicants: the Latine Church also ordained, that the Deacon should Proclame all Not-Com∣municants to Depart. From which Custome afterwards the word Masse had it's Originall; namely from the words, [Ite, missa est] asSee above Booke 1. Chap. . Sect. . . hath beene confessed. But now the Case is so altered, that if any Non-Communicant, being present shall in Devotion apply himselfe to your Romish Masse, your Canon Mis∣sae (De Applicatione)—& omnium Cir∣cumstantium, quo∣rum tibi fides cogni∣ta est, & nota devo∣tio, pro quibus Tibi offerimus &c. Canon of the Masse provideth that Application of your Sacrifice be made unto him for Remission of sinnes. And that, as your Iesuite teacheth,Hinc. Suarez Ies. Quia oblatio hu∣jus Sacrificij est fru∣ctuosa ex opere ope∣rato: ergò rationi consentaneum est, ut omnes, qui ad illum verè concurrunt, vel per proprium actum, seu concursum mora∣lem, participent hu∣jusmodi fructum ta∣lis oblationis. In 3. Thom. qu. 83. Art. 1. Disp. 79. §. . The Fruit of the Sacri∣fice [Ex opere operato] redoundeth unto him; and not this onely, but also to beCosterus Chri∣stian. Institut. lib. 1. cap▪ 8▪ de sacro Missae officio quotidi audi∣endo. Quotquot ad∣sunt & dignè se parāt, spiritualiter corpore Domini reficiuntur per os Sacerdotis. Spiritually refreshed by the mouth of the Priest. Be you therefore intreated to lend your Attention, but for an Instant of time, and then tell us whether wee speake Reason unto you▪ or no. All Antiquity Catholike (as hath beene ge∣nerally See Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 9. confessed by your selves) never admitted to that part of the Masse, which you call a Sacrifice, any but such as were prepared to Communicate, by receiving the Sacrament, but shut all others out of Doores; which, wee say, they neither would nor could lawfully have done, if they had beene of your now Romish Faith, to believe that it is a Sacrifice Pro∣pitiatory for all such as devoutly attend to behold it. For, wheresoever there was a Sacrifice of Expiation among the Iewes, under the Law, all persons had liberty to partake thereof. Wee thinke that this Argument sticketh fast in the Bowels of this Cause.
That the Romish Church lesseneth the due estimation of Christ's Passion, in her Applying of it to others, for the increasing of falsly-devised and unjust Gaine, in behalfe of the Priest; without all warrant of Antiquity. SECT. IV. HItherto wee have expected some Reasons, which might move your Church so to lessen the proportion of Christ's Passion, in the Application therof for Remission either of sinnes or punishments. And now at length your Iesuite Sal∣meron cometh to resolve us, saying,Salmeron Ies. Si hoc esset infiniti valoris, & celebrata esset Missa pro re∣demptione omniū a∣nimarum, quae in ex∣piatorio carcere con∣tiuentur, totum eva∣cuaret Purgatorium: quod non est creden∣dum, quia frustrà tot Missae pro uno defun∣cto celebrarentur. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. pa. 268. De Missis pri∣vatis. If the Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood were of infinite value, then one Masse being said for all the soules in the Dungeon of Purgatory would evacuate and empty the whole place, and then should it be in vaine to say many Masses for one soule. So hee. Wee may not so farre digresse, as to enter into this Controversie of Purgatory, because wee are to finish that which wee have now in hand. Else were it easie to shew, that the infinite gaine, which your Alchemists worke out of your forge of Purgatory-fire, hath occasioned this Heterodoxe and graceles Doctrine of disannul∣ling the infinite efficacie of Christ's Blood: which is so utter∣ly forlorne of all Approbation from Antiquity, that your Disputers have not alleged so much as one Iota, out of any Fa∣ther, for warrant thereof. Next, in the Sacrifice of your Masse, there is (sayValent. Ies. Quaedam portio re∣missionis competit Sacerdoti ministran∣ti, quaedam ei, cui Sacerdos vult pecu∣liari intentione ap∣plicare—Quae inten∣tio non tantum valet pro pluribus, ac si pro uno solo celebretur. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. ult. §. Ac primum. Et Alan. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 34. Vt qui Sacrificium pro Pe∣tro oeit, ratione sti∣pendij. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 79. §. 9. pag. 1021. you) a Portion thereof appropriated to the Priest alone, which is a power to apply, by his Memento, the same Sacrifice to whom hee will, so farre forth that hee extend his Memento upon any one, to whom hee shall be pleased to intend it, upon Condition to receive money therefore: insomuch, that It will be more availeable for that one, than if it were extended to many. So you. Very well, but by what Law came your Priests to this peculiar power of dispensing a Portion for their owne advantage? CardinallAlan. In cer∣tarum personarum Causis certam Sacri∣ficij aestimationem, c fructus quantitatem desinire, non tam cer∣ta loquimur, quia ad ista particularia nec Scripturae, nec Patres quicquam conferunt. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 34. pag. 635. Alan (your Advocate) is ready to answer for you, and wee are attentive to heare what he saith; There is not either any Scripture (saith hee) or Father shewing any such thing, for such a maner of esteeming the fruit of Christ's Sa∣crifice. So hee. In the third place, whiles wee are in this speculation, wee heare one of you putting this Case. If the Priest shall receive a stipend of Peter, upon Condition that hee shall apply his Memento and Intention upon the soule of Iohn, departed this life, and hee notwithstanding doth apply it unto the good of the soule of Paul, whether now the Priests Memento should
worke for the good of the soule of Iohn, according to the Priests Obligation upon the Condition made with Peter, or else for the good of the soule of Paul, according to the Priests immediate Intention. Here, although some of you stand for the justice of theInquiri po∣test, an tenetur Sa∣cerdos ex justitia ap∣plicare Sacrificium Petro, ratione ab eo accepti stipenij; nihilominus applicat Paulo: vel cum jubetur offerre Sacrificium pro tali Defuncto, offert pro se. Quidam dicunt Sacrificium operari in hujusmodi casibus non secundùm voluntatem Ministri, sed secundùm obligationem, quâ tenetur pro hoc vel illo offerre. Ali volunt obligationem tenere—Sed operatur se∣cundùm intentionem Ministri, quatenùs est Christi Minister. Suarez. quo supra. [But your Cardinall,] Sed injustè facere. Alan. quo supra, cap. 35. pag. 640. Priests Obligation, yet some others Resolution is, that the Priests intention (albeit unjust) must stand for good. Wee have done. CHALLENGE. VVHereas it is now evident, that your Romish Masse ser∣veth so well for your no small gaine, by appropriating of a Priestly portion to be dispensed for some one or other soule for money, as it were the Cookes fee, and that but onely for the paines of a Spirituall intention; yea, though it be to the Injury of the Purchaser: It can be no marvell, that wee heare so often, and as loud shouts for your magnifying of the Romane Masse, as ever Demetrius, and his fellow Craft-mates made for Diana, the Goddesse of the Ephesians. It remaineth, that wee deliver unto you a Synopsis of the Abominations of your Romish Sacrifice, which wee have reser∣ved to be discovered in the eighth Booke. Wee hasten to the last Examination, which is of Proestants. CHAP. XII. That the Protestants, in their Celebration, offer to God a Spirituall Sacrifice, which is Propitiatory, by way of Complacencie. SECT. I. CAll but to mind our formerSee above Chap. . Distinction of a dou∣ble kinde of Propitiousnesse; one of Complacencie, and Acceptation, and the other of Merit, and Equivulencie; and ioyne hereunto your owne de∣finition of Propitiousnesse by way of gracious ac∣ceptance, when you confesse that Every religious Act, where∣by man in devotion adhereth intirely unto God, in acknowledge∣ment
of his Soveraigntie, mercie, and bountie, is propitious unto God. Now then, Protestants celebrating the Eucharist with Faith in the Sonne of God, and offering up to God the Com∣memoration of his death, and mans Redemption thereby (a worke farre exceeding in worth the Creation, if it so were, of a thousand Thousand worlds) and thereby powring out their whole spirit of Thankfulnesse unto God (in which respect this Sacrament hath obtained a more singular name than any other, to be called Eucharistia, that is, A Giving of Thankes, and that most worthily, forasmuch as the end and efficacie of Christ's Passion is no lesse than our Redemption from the eter∣nall paines of hell, and purchase of our everlasting salvation:) All these (I say) and other essentiall Duties of holy Devotion being performed not according to Mans Invention, as yours; but to that direct, and expresse Prescript, and ordinance of Christ himselfe [Do this,] It is not possible, but that their whole complementall Act of Celebration must needs be through Gods favour Propitious, and well-pleasing in his sight. Take unto you our last Proposition, concerning the second kinde of Propitiousnesse. That the Protestants may more truly be said to offer to God a meritoriously Propitiatory Sacrifice for Remission of Sinne, than the Romish do. SECT. II. BEfore wee resolve any thing, wee are willing to heare your Cardinals Determination. The Death of Christ (saithBellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 3. Mors Christi est Sa∣crificium prop iè di∣ctum, & perfectissi∣mum. hee) is a proper, and most perfect Sacrifice. So hee, most Christianly: But after noting the Profession of Protestants, to hold that the same Most perfect Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse is the onely proper Sacrifice of Christian Religion, hee denyeth this, because (saithBellarm. Ibid. cap. 20. §. Probatur.—Sublato Sacrificio Missae, nullum restat in Ecclesia Sacrifici∣um propriè dictum. Nam si ullum esset, id esset Sacrificium , illud enim u∣num▪ Adversarij as∣signant unicum esse Christianae religionis Sacrificium. At hoc commune omnibus veris Religionibus, sed semel poractum mane, quoad esse∣ctum, & virtutem. hee) This is common to all true Religions, and being but once done, ceaseth to be any more, but onely in the virtue and effi∣cacie thereof. And all this hee doth for establishing of another properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Romish Masse, by the hands of the Priest. But wee, believing that That Sacrifice of Christ's death was but once offered as (according to our other distinction) the one∣ly subjective, meritorious, and properly-Propitiatory Sacrifice, therefore it ceaseth to be so any more; but yet is still objective∣ly perpetuall in the Church of God, as the object of our Re∣membrance of his Death, Representatively and Commemorative∣ly,
both in our Acts of Celebration, and in our Prayers and Prai∣ses offered up to God, in the true apprehension of the Efficacie and Virtue thereof. In which respect (as Christian Beliefe professeth) Christ is calledApoc. 5. 12. The Lambe slaine from the begin∣ning of the world: so is hee the same still, and ever will be un∣till the end thereof; for which cause our Celebration is called of the Apostle A shewing of the Lords Death till hee come. So that as by the Bodily Eye, beholding theIohn 3. Serpent on a pole in the Wildernesse, they that were stung with the deadly poyson of Fiery Serpents were healed; even so All, who by Faith, the Eye of the soule, behold the Sonne of God lift upon the Crosse, shall not perish, but have ever∣lasting life. But what is that Propitiousnesse of the Sacrifice of Christ's Body (will you say) which you Protestants will be said to offer more truly to God, than that wee Romanists do, and wherein doth the difference consist? Be you as willing to heare as to aske, and then know, that first although the whole Act of our Celebration, in Commemoration of Christ's Death, as procee∣ding from us, be a Sacrifice propitious, as other holy Acts of Devotion, onely by Gods Complacencie and Acceptance; Yet the object of our Commemoration being the Death and Passion of Christ, in his Body and Blood, is to us, by the efficacie therof, a truly and properly propitiatory Sacrifice, and Satisfaction, for a perfect Remission of all sinnes. Thus concerning Protestants. As for you, if wee consider your owne outward Acts of Cele∣bration, (wherein in Ten Circumstances wee inde Ten Transgres∣sions of the Institution of Christ, and therefore provocatory to stir up Gods displeasure) wee thinke not that it can be Propitiato∣ry so much as by way of Gods Acceptance. Next, when we dive into the mysterie of your Masse, to seeke out the subject matter of your Sacrifice in the hands of your Priest, which according to the faith of your Church is called a Proper propitiatory Sacrifice in it selfe; it hath beene found (be∣sides our Proofes from Scriptures, and your owne Principles) bySee a Syopsis hereof, Booke 8. Ten Demonstrations out of Ancient Fathers to be Sacra∣mentall Bread and Wine, and not the Body and Blood of Christ. Wherefore the Subject of your Sacrifice can be no more properly (that is, Satisfactorily) in it selfe Propitiatory, than substantiall Bread can be Christ. Lastly, in examining the End of the Propitiation by the Masse, Wee perceive your Doctors in suspense among themselves, whether you be capable of Propitiation for Remission of sinnes, or else of Temporall Punishments due to such Sinners; or if of Sins, whether of Mortall sinnes, or else of Veniall sinnes only: to wit, such as you thinke may be washed away by your owne
Holy-water-sprinckle. Marke now, wee pray you, these three: First, what you offer, namely not Christ, but his Sacrament. Secondly, by what Acts of Celebration, to wit, most whereof are not Acts of Obedience, but of Transgression. Thirdly, to what End, viz, not for a Faithfull, but for a doubtfull; not for an absolute, but for a partiall Remission, and that also you know not whether of sinnes, or of punishments: and then must you necessarily acknowledge the happinesse of our Protestants profession, concerning the Celebration of the Eucharist, in comparison of your Ro∣mish. How much more, when you shall see discovered the Idolatry there∣of, which is our next Taske.
A Vindication of certaine Testimonies, alleged in the II. III. IV. and V. Bookes of the preceding Treatise; against the Vnjust Imputations of one (whosoever). Popishly inspired: To the greater Disadvantage of the Romish Cause, wherein hee hath so much laboured. THese kinde of Vindications ought not to seeme unne∣cessary to any Reader, who would wish either estimati∣on to the Author, or just advantage to the Cause, when he shal perceive extreme diligence joined with an unstanchable malignancie, in sifting every corner, and weighing every grane. Howbeit that these Exceptions (such as they are) may worke both for the Correction of the Print, where it is requisite, and further Confutation of Romish Cavillers; yet I must say un∣to this Objector (as unto others of his kin) Etiamsi gratiae cau∣sâ nihil facis, omnia tamen grata sunt quae facis. Only I wish these his Exceptions had come in due time to my hands, (before the fift, and part of the sixt Booke had beene reprinted, in this se∣cond Edition) that my Answers unto them might have bene in∣serted in their proper places. But now to the objected Testimo∣nies, of which (that in Epiphanius being altered in this second Pag. 121. Edition) Wee will take the rest in due order. The first Passage concer∣neth a Testimony of S. EPIPHANIVS. Alleged in theEdit. 1. pag. 92. Pag. 120. of this second Edition. TO leave the Objectors verball Exceptions, because (now) satisfyed in the second Edition; and to try that which hee thinketh materiall. His OB. Bellarmine cannot be guilty of that falsity which you im∣pute unto him, of adding to Epiphanius, and making him say: This is to be believed, although it be repugnant to our Senses: for these words [Although they be repugnant to our Senses] hee allegeth not as the words of Epiphanius, because hee hath them in a different Character. ANSW. It will be sufficient to set downe the words of Bellar∣mine his owne, thus; ETIAM ADDIT, (Epiph.) ID ESS CRE∣DENDVM, LICET SENSVS REPVGNENT; that is, HEE (spea∣king of Epiphanius) ALSO ADDETH, THAT IT IS TO BE BELIEVED, ALTHOVGH IT BE REPVGNANT TO OVR SEN∣SES. How then can it be denyed that Bellarmine delivered those words, REPVGNANT TO OVR SENSES, as the words of Epiphanius, hearing Bellarmine himselfe affirming that they were ADDED by Epiphanius? If I had denyed this, I would have given my Objector leave to say, I had beene out of my Senses.
The Second Passage. Book. 2.Edit. 1. pag. 95. Pag. 129. TERTVLLIAN. OB. I. THe words of Tertullian are these; [Christum corporis sui figuram panis dedisse;] you, instead of [Panis] have Panem, for your Advantage, contrary to the faith of that Edition which you follow of Laur. de la Barre, pag. 180. ANSVV. A sore Taxation, which pincheth upon my Fidelity; I shall then give a summarie Answer, after that I have received my full Charge. O. II. Bellar. lib. 2. de Enchar. cap. 7. argueth against Protestants for the words of Tertullian thus; [Those words, saith hee, do not sig∣nifie that Christ gave a Signe of his Body, and not his Body it selfe.] otherwise he would not have said that Christ [Corporis sui figuram pa∣nis dedisse.] How then should it have beene, I pray you? OB. III. It should have beene [Panis,] or rather [Pani,] as Pamelius (upon that place) hath it. ANSVV. So then the Objector hath chosen Pamelius, a lear∣ned Commentator, upon the same words of Tertullian, and Romishly professed, for his Arbitrator; and I shall not gain-say his owne choice. Pamelius therefore in the veryEdit. Paris. 1580. Edition and page cited by the Objector, ingenuously confesseth saying; TERTVLLIANVS DICENS CHRISTVM CORPORIS SVI FI∣GVRAM PANIS DEDISSE; SVBAVDIT, MORE SVO, ACCVSA∣TIVUM. By which words of Pamelius wee have gained fowre Advan∣tages. I. A Iustification of the sense of the Accusative [PA∣NEM,] as Pamelius sheweth. II. A Condemnation of the Ob∣jector his Falsehood, who said that Pamelius had it [PANI.] III. A Consutation of Bellarmine, who, because the word was PANIS, and not PANEM, would needs inferre that Christ gave not onely a Signe of his Body, but the Body it selfe; whereas Tertullian (saith Pamelius) used the Genitive-case, PANIS, in∣stead of the Accusative, PANEM; how? MORE SVO; that is, AS TERTVLLIAN, VSED To Do: which plainly sheweth that Bellarmine was either ignorant of the style of Tertullian, or ra∣ther (if hee knew it) guilty of Dissimulation herein, namely, More suo. The Last is a Manifestation of an egregious fond∣nesse in them Both, by insisting upon Tertullian's style so rigid∣ly, in the Genitive-case, which in English must needs stand thus: Christ to have given a Signe of his owne Body of Bread; which is plainly a Non-sense, as any may perceive; so that I may well conclude, ô felix error! of changing the word, PANIS, into PANEM; although it were but by chance, and onely to make true Latine, according to ordinary Construction. By occasion whereof, so much Ignorance and Perversnesse of the Adver∣sary hath beene displayed.
The Third Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 107. pag. 151. CARD. BELLARMINE. IT was affirmed that the first Imposition that Bellarmine could find of the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, as a matter of Faith, was about the yeare 1073. by Pope Gregory the Seventh. OB. Bellarmine said that he would prove against Scotus, that the Fa∣thers taught the same Doctrine. ANSVV. Were his proofe as faisible, as I hold it Impossible, yet was my Assertion, notwithstanding, most true, because I onely spake of the Imposition of this Doctrine of Transubstan∣tiation, as an Article of Faith, upon mens Consciences, not to have beene before that forenamed Pope Gregory the Seventh. The Contrary whereof neither hee, nor any for him, can shew out of any Ancient Father. The Advantage hee giveth us, is the bewraying of his owne Precipitancie. The Fourth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 113. Pag. 162. N. CABASILAS. THe Greeke Archbishop Cabasilas hath told us, that the La∣tines of the Romish Church would not indure the Greeks to call the Eucharist, after the Romish Consecration, Bread. The OB. Romane Catholikes do commonly allow that it be called Bread, after Consecration. ANSVV. I proved from Cabasilas, that they will not indure it: hee telleth mee, without any proofe at all, they do. But if hee should eat no bread, untill hee could finde in Romish wri∣ters the Commonly naming of the Eucharist Bread, after their Consecration thereof, hee within a short time, would be found felo de se. After this the Objector telleth me (which I had taught him before in the first Booke) that Cabasilas and the Greekes hold that the words of Christs Institution, to wit [HOC EST CORPVS MEVM] are not words of Consecration, and therfore called the Romish Eucharist Bread; and Conludeth, OB. Therefore doth not Cabasila's Testimonie availe you. ANSW. It proveth as much as I there assumed to prove: That the Romish would not allow their Eucharist to be called Bread after their Consecration. Our Advantage is to observe your pronesse to quarrell, you know not for what. The Fifth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 125. pag. 177.IRENAEVS. OB. I. YOu translate it [Even as] to make it a Similitude. ANSW. When I was but a Boy, I then learned to translate SICVT, SIC (which are the words of Irenaeus) EVEN As, So.
OB. II. But the Similitude is onely for the Change, and not for the maner of the Change. ANSW. Can there be a Change with a SICVT, EVEN As, without a maner of Similitude of Change? One Advantage herein may be this our further Observation, that Irenaeus, as hee said of the BREAD Consecrated, that it is NO MORE A COMMON THING, BVT CHANGED INTO AN EVCHARIST (a Sacrament:) saith likewise of the other part of the Similitude, that THE BODIES OF THE COMMVNI∣CANTS ARE INCORRVPTIBLE IN HOPE OF RESVRRECTION: meaning, that they are therefore not to be esteemed of in the common Condition of naturall Bodies. Our other Advantage will be, to learne the language of the Fathers, as here of Irenaeus, calling the Bodies of the Faithfull INCORRVPTIBLE; even here in this life, but meaning, because of the hope of their future Resurrection, when they shall be changed indeed, yet not in Substance, but onely in Qualities, from Incorruptibility and Basenesse. Even as hee meant of the change of this Sacrament, consisting of an Earthly, and an Hea∣venly part; the Earthly being the Bread Naturall; and the Hea∣venly being the same Sacramentall, as betokening and signify∣ing the Body of Christ. The Sixth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 124. pag. 178. S. AMBROSE. OB. I. IN citing of Ambrose, you joyne both his Sentences in one. ANSW. Which is no more Advantage to my Cause, than if I should give this Objector two Sixpences for one Shil∣ling. OB. II. You adde [Even as] to make it a Similitude. ANSW. This needed not to have beene added, because Am∣brose his words cannot be understood of any Reader, but as im∣plying a Similitude. OB. III. Bat your Translation is this [Things changed, remaine what they were before:] whereas they should have been rendered ver∣batim, thus: That those things, which were, be still, and changed into another thing. ANSW. I call for an Oedipus to unriddle this, to say that there is a differencet sense betweene THE THINGS THAT WERE BE STILL; AND THEY BE STILL THAT WHICH THEY WERE BEFORE, ALTHOVGH CHANGED INTO ANOTHER THING. That is to say, Of Common Elements made Sacred and Sa∣cramentall. The Seventh Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 134. pag. 190 S. AMBROSE. OB. ETiam, A word of great Asseveration, omitted. ANSW. What needed any more Asseveration than
the words set downe, IPSA NATVRA MVTATVR, which I un∣derstand to be as asseverantly spoken, as if hee had sworne them. OB. II. You say that Ambrose interpreteth his naming of Bread, Christ's Body; by saying afterwards, Corpus Christi Significatur, which is long after. ANSW. It is in the same Chapter, and not long after neither. But this man is as good an Objector as hee is an Observer; who doth not know that which is common to all Writers, that what the Author hath spoken somewhat more obscurely before, hee explaineth it with words more intelligible, albeit long after. OB. III. But Ambrose said elswhere [Panis dicitur, sed Corpus ap∣pellatur;] It is said to be Bread, but it is called the Body of Christ. So saith hee here, Before Consecration it is named Bread, but after Conse∣cration the Body of Christ is signified; here [Significatur] is the same with [Nuncupatur;] Signified is the same with named, or called. ANSW. NAMED AND CALLED are onely Appellations of the outward words, whereas [SIGNIFICATA] alwayes import the sense of the same words, whether spoken or read; so that I shal need, for Confutation, no more but to appeale unto the Ob∣jector himself to distinguish the office of his cares & eyes, where∣by hee apprehendeth onely words, from the Function of his Brain-pan, in judging of their sense and signification. A further Advantage upon this occasion may be had first from another Allegation, of the Objector himselfe, out of Saint Am∣brose lib. 5. de Sacrament. cap. 4. Dixi ante verba Christi panis dicitur; post deprompta Christi verba, non panis dicitur, sed corpus appellatur. Wee heare that Saint Ambrose proveth, that that, which is called the Body of Christ, was before Consecration that which was called Bread: so that [Hoc] in Christ's speech, must signifie Bread, which marreth and dasheth your Romih and li∣terall Exposition of Christ's words (the foundation of all your other errours, concerning Corporall Presence:) to note in Saint Ambrose his Iudgement, that [Hoc] in Christ's speech beto∣kened Bread, which, in the universall Iudgement of all Romish Doctors, cannot be attributed to Christ's Body in a literall sense. And Secondly to recognize the Art of Bellarmine (See Book. 2. pag. 125.) in his misalleging the same words of Ambrose, thus; [Post Consecrationem corpus Christi est,] instead of [CORPVS CHRISTI SIGNIFICATVR.] If that there were no more force in the word [SIGNIFICATVR] than in NOMINATVR, why did your Cardinall bogle and startle at it, and utterly dash it out? The Eighth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 135. pag. 191. S. CYPRIAN. OB. [NOn effigie sed] is not set downe in the Latine sentence of Cy∣prian, and [Caro Factus est] is left out in the English: both of purpose, as will be thought.
ANSW. Neither, I dare sweare, on purpose, because both of them are alleged: the first [NON EFFIGIE, SED] translated in the English, and [CARO FACTVS EST] expressed in the Latine. Our Advantage now is this, to call to our Readers Remem∣brance, that hee must interpret these words of Cyprian by that his other Saying; namely, that Things signifying are called by the same names, by which things signified are called. The Ninth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 135. pag. 191. M. BRERELY. CYprian said: Things Indifferent change their nature after they be commanded. OB. Hee meant not simply, but after a sort, as the Testimonies shew, which hee alleged. ANSW. He meant as simply as any Protestant can do, saying a little before the words, A thing of Indifferencie, being determi∣nated by the Church, if it be violated, is a sinne. What is, if this be not a Change of the Nature, to become (by reason of the Churches Decree) of a thing Indifferent and not sinfull, a thing sinfull, and therefore not Indifferent. The Tenth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 136. pag. 194.IVSTINE MARTYR. OB. YOu make Iustine say, that hee called the Eucharist therefore no common Bread, because it was [,] that is, Sanctified meate. ANSW. And that, I say, millions of Popish Doctors, at the first hearing, would sweare, to wit, that the Church of Rome accounteth the matter of the Eucharist, COMMON BREAD, and WINE, before it be Consecrated. Our Advantage is, that the Objector hath brought an whole house, the Church of Rome it selfe (which you call the house of God) upon his head, by this Exception. The Eleventh Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 136. pag. 195. S. CYRIL. of HIERVSALEM. OB. BEllarmine is taxed of Vnconscionablenesse for concluding out of Cyril that the Sacrament is not to be judged by sense; when as the words of Cyril, in the same place, are expressely saying, [It is the Body of Christ; although thy sense tell thee not so, yet let thy faith confirme thee, &c.] ANSW. I have taxed him most justly, not for any mistaking of the words of Cyril, but for wresting and abusing his meaning, Bellarmine believing it was so sayd of Cyril, as absolutely de∣nying that there can be any tryall of the naturall Substance of Bread, after Consecration, by the verdict of any of mans sen∣ses; whereas Cyril spake onely of the Sacramentall nature
thereof. This was evidently proved out of Cyril, who affir∣ming Sacred Oile to be no more Bare Oile, after Consecration, as he said of the Eucharist, It was no more meere Wine after it be Consecrated; thereby taught us to judge of both alike. E∣ven as wee may say, upon the same reason, that the water of Baptisme is, during the use thereof, no meere Water. But why? even because it is Sacramentall; and that accordingly wee are not to beleeve our Senses, when wee are in Contemplation of this Sacrament, to thinke it now to be mere Water, but beleeve it to be of another nature: else our naturall eyes and senses shall deceive our Spirituall sight of Faith, in discerning the Spiritu∣all and Mysticall meanings thereof. Yea, and in this respect I might have taxed Bellarmine, for inferring from such speeches an absolute denying of the tryall, by sense, of the natural part of the Sacrament, because hee might have beene instructed▪ By the See Booke 2. cap. 1. Sect. 7. Councell of Nice, of the meaning of such speeches of the Fa∣thers; that Councell saying as much of Baptisme, thus, Bap∣tisme is not to be considered with the eyes of our Bodies, but of our Mindes. All which is to abstract the thoughts of Christian men from all Earthly conceipts, when they are conversant in the Celebration of such sacred Mysteries. This wee have no∣ted, Book. 3. pag. 207. This also hath occasioned another Advantage against your Romane Faith, by observing in the same place of Cyril ano∣ther Sentence concerning this Sacrament: Coelestiall Bread (saith hee) sanctifying both Body and Soule. But how both? it follow∣eth, [:] As the Bread is congruous to the Body, so is the word (meaning Christ in his Body) convenient for the soule. What other can be meant hereby, but that calling the Sacrament [] after Conse∣cration, hee acknowledged not any Substantiall change there∣of; and more demonstrably, because of the Comparison hee hath of the Sacramentall applying of the Body of Christ to the food of the Soule, as hee doth the Sacramentall Bread to the nutriment of the Body, and Sanctification thereof, in hope of Resurrection to life, as the Fathers have Commented. The Twelfth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag 132. pag. 298. S. CHRYSOSTOME. OB. CHrysostome is said to be placed in the front of the host of Bellar∣mines Fathers, whereas Bellarmine in his Catalogue of Fathers De Euchar. lib. 2. citeth twenty Fathers before him. ANSW. If Bellarmine have had other Treatises, in his Con∣troversies against K. IAMES of blessed memory, wherein Chry∣sostome was made the Champion, was this fondnesse in mee to say as I have sayd, and not rather rashnesse in this Objector, in thus gain-saying?
OB. II. But you have furthermore omitted the words of Chryso∣stome, which in English should be these [Although these things exceed our sense and reason, yet let us hold them without doubting.] ANSW. Hee telleth mee what was omitted, looking directly upon that, but forgot to acknowledge what was expressed out of Chrysostome, looking askew and asquint at it. My Translation out of Chrysostome delivered his words, in the first part, thus; [ALTHOVGH THE SPEECH OF CHRIST MAY STRANGE TO SENSE AND REASON:) which is  to that which is omitted; Christ's speech exceeds our sense and rea∣son. In the other part was set downe these words of Chrysostome, [YET LET VS BELIEVE HIS WORDS;] Fully equivalent with those which were omitted, [YET LET VS RECEIVE CHRIST'S WORDS WITHOVT DOVBTING;] except the Pa∣pists will thinke us to be of their degenerate Faith, Of Believing with doubting. Where you may perceive that your Objector con∣sidered not how easie it had been for me (by not omitting some words) to have beene superfluous. The Thirteenth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 140. pag. 199. SIXTVS SENENSIS. OB. IT is alleged out of Senensis, that hee maketh Chrysostome to have beene the most frequent in Hyperbolizing of all the Fathers; But Senensis onely saith, that Chrysostome did [Interdum] use Hyper∣bole's. ANSW. And I say, Aliquando [seu, INTERDVM] dormitat Ho∣merus: Esto igitur, [INTERDVM:] Although I made it good in the same Section, that hee often Hyperbolized, yea even in this very point of the Eucharist. OB. II. Elswhere Senensis, you say, giveth us a caution against Chry∣sostome's Rhetricke in this point. ANSW. It is certaine that Senensis doth there most especially and by name note Chrysostome to Hyperbolize, and his Caution being generall, to take heed of his Hyperbole's, may be justly applyed as wel to this, as to that point, there specified in Senensis, according to the Law of Schooles; where Generall rules are ap∣plyable to other examples, besides that which is in the Author specified and adjoyned to the same Rule. But this man had ra∣ther cavill inordinately, by the example of Romish Adversaries, than to be regulated by any rule of reason and moderation. OB. III. Behold you mention Bellarmine, saying that our senses are not deceived in their proper sensible objects; But you forbeare to shew the many Limitations which hee giveth. ANSW. I never held it seasonable to shew a man any thing when he would not see it; otherwise the Objector, who hath sought into every corner of all my Sayings, with purpose to traduce them, could not but have found the same Limitations of Bellarmine punctually set downe. Book. 3. cap. 3. Sect. 7.
The Fourteenth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 141. pag. 200. S. CHRYSOSTOME. OB. TO the words of Chrysostome, [As in Baptisme, Regeneration, the thing Intelligible, is given by water, the thing Sen∣sible] you adde these words, [The Substance of Water remaining] which are not in the Text; whereof your Lordship is conscious, and ther∣fore most unsufferable. ANSW. I must first say, mala mens, malus animus; or as it is in the English, As you muse, so you use: else would not this Ob∣jector have accused mee to be Conscious of this, whereas any might have thought, that the words should have beene (if the Printer had not mistaken) in a different Character, to distin∣guish them from the words of Chrysostome; because, in the Margin, hee was directed to another place, where the full Text of Chrysostome was perfectly alleged, without that Addition now objected. ANSW. II. Yet there is no reasonable man, pondering the words of Chrysostome, but must justifie the Addition of those words of to be most consonant to the meaning of Chry∣sostome (there) speaking of the Water of Baptisme. For is there any one of sound braines, that will deny the Water of Baptisme, after Consecration, to remaine in Substance the same? Besides there hath beene produced another Testimonie, as out of Chrysostome, that Bread, even in the Sacrament of the Eu∣charist, after Consecration, remaineth in Substance the same. These should the Objector have ruminated upon, before hee layd downe this Accusation, but that hee found they were not for his distemperate palate. The Fifteenth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 14. pag. 201. EVSEBIVS EMISSENVS. OB. YOu referre vs to Master Brerely his Liturgie, Tract. 2. Sect. 2. Subd. 2. in the Margin, curtailing the words which should make for Transubstantiation; and making him argue from these words, [Post verba Christi, est Corpus Christi:] And putting upon him so weake an Argument, when as hee doth there but onely mention the name of Eusebius, referring us to a fuller Sentence, which hee citeth out of Eu∣sebius in some few pages following. ANSW. If the Objector had beene so curteous as to have lookt back to Master Brerely's Allegation of the said Testimony of Eusebius, some few leaves before, pag. 160. as hee was cu∣rious for (Contention-sake) to urge the words following in some pages after, which hee saith are omitted, and concerne Transubstantiation, hee might have found that Allegation of Master Brerely as I delivered it, Tract. 2. Sect. 2. Subd. 2. [SVBSTANTIA PANIS POST VERBA CHRISTI EST CORPVS
CHRISTI.] As for the words following, which corcerne Conversion of Bread, it was beyond the scope which I had then in hand, which concerned onely the Enunciative Speeches of Christ (namely of calling Bread his Body) and not the maner of Change thereof; which point notwithstanding is afterwards handled at full in the same Section. Our Advantage from this mans Cavillation is this: That hee calleth this maner of Arguing out of the Sentences of the Fa∣thers, Bread after Consecration is the Body of Christ: Ergo, it is meant to be really and Substantially Christs Body, as it was in the Manger, to be but a [WEAK ARGVMENT,] to the Confutation, and (if the Person of the Objector were of sufficient Authority) to the Confusion of all the Doctors of the Church of Rome, who have held their Arguments taken from the words of Christ, after his taking Bread saying [THIS IS MY BODY] to be the foundation of all their Arguments, for proofe of Transub∣stantiation. ANSW. II. Yet I was much to blame, I confesse, in not An∣swering at all to the objected Testimony of that so bastardly a Book of Homilies, attributed to Eusebius, which the Romish Do∣ctors themselves, of best judgement and estimation, could not untill this day tell upon whom to Father it: All confessing that it was not the Book of that Euseb. whose name it beareth: Some affirming, that the Author was Faustus the French-man; Some Caesarius; Some Eucherius. And as for the Booke it selfe, they have likewise put upon it the brands of two great Heresies, Ari∣anisme & Pelagianisme. Which taxation and hallucination of our Adversaries may be to themselves, without our Answer, their owne Satisfaction, not to thinke it worthy of Answering. The Sixteenth Passage. Book. 3.Edit. 1. pag. 143. pag. 202. GREG. NYSSEN. A Summary Answer to this Objection, out of the Testimony of Gregory Nyssen. Although Bellarmine doth not produce the words of Nyssen, yet doth hee direct his Reader to Nyssens Treatise of Manna, where the Sentence is, which is alleged by others. Nor can hee be excusable, in that, having read the Testimony now objected, hee did not thereby perceive that the Fathers Sacramentall speeches are not to be taken in the rigidi∣ty of the words. Our Advantage upon this occasion is, that, our Objectors referring us to the Arguments of Bellarmine, out Greg. Nyssen, it hath caused us to light upon and to examine this which followeth, urged by your Cardinall, for Transubstanti∣ation; where speaking of the [Bread which came downe from hea∣ven, and was prepared for us without seed, without tilling, without mans worke: Ths (saith Nyssen) is signifyed in this Mysterie, nor is this an uncorporeall and unbodily thing: for how can a thing
uncorporeall and without a Body, be food unto a Body; But that thing which is not uncorporeall, is altogether a Body] Now let us but trie the Romish Faith by this Lydian Stone, and wee shall finde it to be meerely counterfeit and base. For aske any of the Ro∣mish Disputers, what it is, which in this Sacrament is knowne to nourish, whether man or mouse? And they answer us that the Accidents of Bread, voyd of the substance of Bread, is that which is Nutritive. But Greg. Nyssen saith just the lat Contra∣ry, [NOTHING CAN NOVRISH A BODY BVT THAT WHICH IS A CORPOREAL SVBSTANCE,] which being so spoken, in re∣spect of the Eucharist, proveth infallibly that the Substance of Bread remaineth in this Sacrament after Consecration; if so, then, in the universall judgement of all the Doctors of the Church of Rome, there can be no Transubstantiation. The Seventeenth Passage. Book. 4.Edit. 1. pag. 149. pag. 212. TERTVLLIAN. OB. I. THe word [Bread] is added. ANSW. No, but truly related, and that by the Authority of Tertullian himselfe, whose former words are, Christ distributed [PANEM, BREAD,] to his Disciples, faciens [ILLVM, that is, making IT, his BODY, THAT IS, A FIGVRE of his BODY.] There is no Schoole-boy, that knoweth his Grammar, which will not say that the Relative, IT, must be referred to the Antecedent, BREAD. And of this, IT, do de∣pend all the words following. OB. II. The words of Tertullian being these [Christ sayd▪ This is my Body, that is, a figure of my Body:] you put in, [IS,] saying That is, It [IS] a figure of my Body, which will be complayned of. ANSW. I answer therefore, not to trouble his braines with Grammar-learning, which teacheth the Particle [IS] , to agree with that which followeth; but to deale with him by an example, to make his fondnesse more palpable. Can any man at the first sight of an Ivy-bush, say, This is a Taverne, THAT IS, A Signe of a Taverne, and not meane that it [IS A SIGNE] of a Taverne? OB. III. Your Adversaries will complaine of this, seeing they are perswaded that this is not spoken of a figure actually present, but perfectly past. ANSW. God send mee alwayes such Adversaries, who in their greatest subtilties bewray their extremest otishnesse, in complaining of my [IS] in the Present-ense, and in requiring the sense of the time perfectly past; as if Tertullia had said thus, Christ sayd this is my Body, [THAT IS, IT WAS] a figure of my Body. Here have wee just reason to reflect upon this Ob∣jector with that Saying, Risum teneatis amici? Yet the Objector (lest we might thinke him not to Insanire cum ratione) yieldeth
this Reason, why it should be meant of the time passed, before the coming of Christ. OB. IV. Because of the words immediatly following, [Figura autem non fuisset, nisi esset veritatis corpus:] shew that the word, [Figure,] was not taken representatively, but Typically. ANSW. When Tertullian spake onely narratively, by repea∣ting the words of Christ, he must needs speak in the tense and time when Christ uttered them, when hee sayd [IT IS MY BODY, THAT IS, IS A FIGVRE OF MY BODY,] But after spea∣king Enunciatively, with the Relation from his owne time when hee wrot, to the time of Christs Speech, which was the distance of three hundred yeares, hee could not but use the time perfectly past, saying, [It had not beene a figure] namely, when Christ called it his Body, [except, &c.] The Argu∣ment of Tertullian, taken from those words of Christ, stands thus: Christ in the Sacrament gave a figure of his Body; But a figure is not a figure of a figure, therefore Christ gave a figure of a True Body. Let us consult againe with Tertullians words of Exposition, [IT HAD NOT BEENE A FIGVRE, EXCEPT THERE HAD BEENE THE TRVTH OF HIS BODY:] But Christs Body had no TRVTH of BEING before his Incarnation and time of his existence in the Flesh; and therfore [FVISSET] extended not unto any Type, which had beene before Christs being on earth. Wherefore this [HAD] of Tertullian, I hope, will put this Objector to his Non putabam, or Had I wist. Our Advantages occasioned by this Accusation are great, and divers: One is to discerne more clearly the then-Catholike Do∣ctrine in the dayes of Tertullian. Next to observe the stupid insatuation of our Romish Adversaries. The Last will be to display an Heresie in the Article of the Church of Rome, that teacheth an absolute absence of the Substance of Bread in this Sacrament. For if it were condemned by Tertullian, in the Marcionites, to teach that Christ had no true, but a Fantasticall Body, notwithstanding all the Demonstrances of sense, Eating, Weeping, Sleeping, Bleeding; and of the Apostles feeling him: How shall not the Romish Doctrine of a No-Existence of Bread in the Eucharist, notwithstanding the Contradiction of Smel∣ling, Seeing, Feeling, and Tasting it, be a welcome Patro∣nage and Skonce to the former Heresie of denying the Verity of Christs Body?
THE SEVENTH BOOKE, Concerning the last Romish Consequence, derived from the depraved sense of the words of Christ, [THIS IS MY BODY;] which is your Divine Adora∣tion of the Sacrament; contrary to these other words of Christ, [IN REMEM∣BRANCE OF MEE.] CHAP. I. WEe have hitherto passed thorow many dan∣gerous and pernicious Gulfes of Romish Doctrines, which our instant haste will not suffer us to looke backe upon, by any re∣petition of them. But now are wee en∣tring upon Asphaltites, or Mare mortuum, even the Dead Sea of Romish Idolatrie; whereinto all their Superstitious and Sa∣crilegious Doctrines do empty themselves: which, how dete∣stable it is, wee had rather prove, than prejudge. The State of the Question, concerning Adoration of the Sacrament SECT. I. IN the thirteenth Session of your Councell of Trent, wee finde a Decree commanding thus,Concil. Trid. Cultum Latriae; qui vero Deo debetur, in veneratione huic Sa∣cramento exhibeant. Sess. 13. cap. 5. Let the same divine honour, that is due to the true God, be given to this Sacrament.

I, in a Catholike faith, being prostrate before thee (Lord Iesus) adore thee God, whom I believe to be corporally present under the formes of Bread and Wine. {fleur-de-lys} So you. But what do they, whom you call Sacramentaries, judge of this kinde of worship, can you tell?Bellarm. Omnes Idololatriam appellant hujusmodi adorationem. Lib. 4. de Eucharist. cap. 29. §. Porrò. All of them (saith your Cardinall) call it Idolatrie. But they, whom you call Lutherans, are they not of the same Iudgement? say,Gregor. Valent. Lutherani nos Idololatras vocant, seu (ut ipsi nugari solent) Artolatras. Lib. 1. de Idololat. cap. 3. §. Sed. They call us (because of this worship) Artolaters, that is, Bread-wor∣shippers and Idolaters, saith your Iesuite. As for our Church of England, Shee accordingly saith, that The Sacrament of the Lords Supper was not reserved, carryed about, lifted up, or wor∣shipped. Our Method must now be to treat first of Christs Institution, or Masse; next of the Profession of Ancient Fathers; then of your Romish Masse in it selfe; and lastly wee shall returne againe to our owne home, to demonstrate the happy Security, which our Church hath in her maner of worship. So that these contradictory Propositions, This Sacrament is to be adored with divine worship, and, Is not to be adored with divine worship, being the two different scales of this Controversie, the one will pre∣ponderate the other, according to the weight of Arguments, which shall be put into either of them. Of the Institution of Christ; shewing that there was therein neither Precept for this Adoration of the Sacra∣ment, nor Practice thereof. SECT. II. NO outward Adoration of the Sacrament was practised of the Disciples of Christ (say wee) at the Institution there∣of, which you confesse with us; and take upon you to give a
reason thereof, to wit, thatCaster Ies. Nec opus erat ut ge∣nu slexo significatio∣nem novam honoris darent, sumentes cor∣pus dominicum, quià eundem habebant praesentem, & corpus suum porrigentem, quem mente semper colebant. Enchir. de Euch. Tit. Adoratio, Answering this Obje∣ction: Apostoli in ul∣tima coena hoc Sa∣cramentum non ado∣rabant. There was no need that the Apostles should use any outward signification of honour to the Sa∣crament, because they had then Christ present and visible before them So your Iesuite, which contradicteth your owne Ob∣jection, of therefore adoring Christ in receiving the Sacra∣ment, because then heeSee hereafter Chap. 7. Sect. 2. Cometh under the roofe of your mouths; for the neerer our approach is to any Majesty, the greater useth to be our outward humiliation. But well; no Practice of out∣ward Adoration by the Apostles at that time can appeare, much lesse have you any Evidence of any Precept for it. If there had beene in the words of Christ, or in the volume of the New Testament any syllable thereof, your Cardinall would not have roaved so farre as to Deuteronomie, in the Old Testament, to fetch his onely defence out of these words of God,Bellarm. lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 29. Scriptum est Deut. 6. Dominū tuum ado∣bis, &c. §. His prae∣missis. Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God; (supposing that the Bread which is worshipped is indeed the Sonne of God:) which is, as it were, mere Canting being the basest kinde of Reasoning that can be, and is therefore called of Logicians, A begging of the point in Question. Wee contrarily adhere to the Institution of Christ in all points necessary, and essentiall thereunto, and knowing that the A∣postle promised to deliver1 Cor 11. Whatsoever hee had received of the Lord, concerning this Sacrament (which you hold to be the principall part of your Romish Religion) wee are perswaded that he in expressing the other Commands of Christ, touching Consecration, Administration, and Communication of this Sacra∣ment, never taught that your Article of divine Adoration, whereof hee gave not so much as the least intimation. The A∣postolicall times faile you. Wee shall try if the next, called the Primitive Age, can any whit advantage your Cause, which is our second Station. CHAP. II. Of the Doctrine of Antiquity, concerning the A∣doration of the Eucharist. SECT. I. THe Iudgement of Antiquity is objected by you, and the same is opposed by us against you. Let both be put to the Triall; First, by answering of your Objections out of the Fathers against us: and then by opposing their direct Testimo∣nies against you. Your Objections are partly
Verball, and partly Practicall; the Verball are of three kinds, two whereof are specified in the next Proposition. That neither the objected maner of Invitation to come with Feare, nor of Association of Angels, spoken of by the Fa∣thers, imply any Divine Adoration of the Eucharist. SECT. II. OVt ofChrysost. in Homaed Cor. 24. Cum horrore accedamus ad Deum. Ob. Har∣ding, &c. Item Bel∣lar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 22. Citatis locis qui∣busdā Chrysostomi, ad haec Adversarij ne{que} respondent, ne∣que respondere pos∣sint: Sienim Angeli ad altare astant capi∣tibus inclinatis, & cū horrore ac tremore vix audent intueri, propter splendorē in∣dé emicantem, quis negare potest aliud i∣bi esse quam panem? Et si angeli adorant, quis homines repre∣hendere potest si a∣dorent? Paulò supe∣rius ex Hom. 41. ad Corin.

Chrysostome is objected his Exhortation, that Christians in their approach to this Sacrament, Do come with horror, feare, and reverence. Next, is their talking of the Angels, being present at this Celebration, holding downe their heads, and not daring to behold the excellencie of the splendor, &c. and to deprecate the Lambe lying on the Altar. These seeme to your Cardinall to be such invincible Testimonies, to prove the Adoration of Christ as Corporally present, that hee is bold to say, They never hitherto were answered, nor yet possibly can be. So he; taking all Chrysostomes words in a literall sense; whom notwith∣standing your owneSee above B. 3. Cha 4. Sect . in the Challenge. Senensis hath made to be the most Hyper∣bolizing Preacher of all the Fathers: and therefore hath given unto all Divines a speciall Caution against his Rhetorick, in the point of this Sacrament, lest wee understand him literally. Of which kinds you may have some Instances out of the very pla∣ces objected, whereChrys. Orat. in Philogon. . Idem paulò superius. Chrysostome saith indeed, That wee see that Lambe lying on the Altar. And said hee not also, even in the same Oration, Wee see here Christ lying in the Manger, wrapped in his clouts; a dreadfull and admirable spectacle? So hee. But (say) do you see herein either Cratch or Clothes? or can you talke of Christ's lying on this Altar, who teach, that as hee is in this Sacrament, hee hath no locall Site, Posture, or Position at all? It is also true of the Angels, hee said [] they stand in dread, and the sight is fearefull. And hee saith no lesse of the Festivall day of Christ's Nativity, that It is most venerable, and terrible, and the very Metropolis of all others. Yet doth not this argue any Corporall Presence of Christ, in respect of the day. This Answer, taken from Chrysostome, may satisfie for Chrysostome. Wee grant furthermore to yourBellar. lib 2 de Missa, . 15. § Quin∣to—Omnes Graeci Patres passim vocant terribile Sacrificium, & horroris plenum. Cardinall, That all the Greeke Fathers call the Eucharist terrible, and full of dread. But what? As therefore implying a Corporall presence of Christ, and Divine Adoration thereupon? This is your Cardinals scope; but to prove him an ill marke-man, take unto you an answer from your selves,See above, Booke 5. Cha. 2. Sect. 4. who teach with the Apostle, that All pro∣phane comers to this Sacrament make themselves guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ; in which respect wee do acknowledge
it to be Dreadfull indeed, especially to the  yet ma∣king no more for a Corporall presence, than the contempt of Bap∣tisme, whereby a man maketh himselfe obnoxious to Gods judgements, (asSee above B. 5. Chap 2. Sect 3 Augustine hath compared them) can same. Another answer you may receive from Ancient Fathers, who, together with the Eucharist, haveSee above B. 6. Chap 5 Sect 8. called the reading of Scriptures Terrible; and so were the Canons of Baptisme called Terrible, even byIbidem. Chrysostome himselfe. As for your objected assistance of Angels, at the Celebration of the Eucharist, it is no such a Prerogative, but that the Prayers of the Faithfull, and Baptisme will plead for the same honour: your Durandus granting of the first, thatDurand An∣geli aduur semper nobis orantibus. Lib. 7. cap. 12. The Angels of God are present with us in our Prayers; and for the second, Divine Nazianzen teacheth that . Orat. 40 de Baptis∣mo The Angels are present at Baptisme, and do magnifie (or honour) it with their presence, and observance: notwithstanding none of you ever defended either Corporall presence of Christ in the Sacrament of Baptisme, or yet any Adoration of the consecrated Element of Water therein. If these two may not serve take unto you this Saying of Augu∣stine, spoken of persons baptized,August. de meritis & de  Christum portantur. They (saith hee) with feare are brought unto Christ their Physician, that is (for so hee expoundeth himselfe) unto the Sacrament of eternall Salvation. Which one Saying of so Orthodox a Father doth instru us how to interpret all your objected Testimonies; to wit, that Whosoever come to the receiving of the Sacrament of Christ, they ought to come with feare, as if they were in the presence of Christ. And thus is your unanswerable Objection answered, so that this your Cable rope being untwisted is become no bet∣ter than loose towe. Now to your third Objection. That the most earnestly-objected Phrase [] and Adora∣tion, used of the Fathers, doth not necessarily inferre any Divine Worship of the Eucharist. SECT. III. WEe find not your Disputers more pressing and urgent in any Argument, than in objecting the word, Reverence, Honour, and especially Adoration, for proofe that Divine Ho∣nour is due to the Eucharist, as to Christ himselfe, whensoever they finde the use of that Phrase applyed by Antiquity unto this Sacrament. Our answer is first in generall; That the words Reverence, Honour, and Adoration, simply in themselves, with∣out the Adjunct and Additament, Divine, cannot conclude the Divine worship proper to God. To this purpose wee desire you not to hearken unto us, but to heare your selves speake.Mr. Brerely. Pontificales vestes, & calices coeperunt esse honorandi, Sacra∣menti causâ. Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 8.

Augustine did to Baptisme, when hee said, Wee reverence Baptisme wheresoever. Accordingly of the word, Adoration, your Cardinall and o∣ther Iesuites are bold to say, thatRibera Ies. in Apoc. 19.

[And hereckoneth A∣doration of Reliques, Tombes of Martyrs, &c.] It is sometimes used al∣so in Scriptures for an honour common to Creatures, as to An∣gels, to Kings, to Martyrs, and to their Tombes. And although your Disputers should conceale this Truth, yet would the Fa∣thers themselves informe us in what a Latitude they used the same word, Adoration. Among the Latine Fathers, one, who knew the propriety of that Language as well as any, viz. Ter∣tullian, saying,Adoro ple∣nitudinem Scriptura∣rum. Adversus Her∣mog. post medium. pag. 350. I adore the plenitude of Scriptures; and Gre∣gory Nazianzene, among the Greeke, for his excellencie in di∣vine knowledge,Greg. Nazian.  Orat. 40. sirnamed the Divine (and therefore may not be thought to apply words belonging to Divine worship pre∣posterously or improperly) instructed the party baptized to say thus to the Devill, Fall downe [] and worship mee. Thus much in Generall. Let us proceed, You to your particular Objections, and Wee to our Answers. I. Ob. Ambrose saith, thatAmbros. lib. 3. de Spirit. sanct. cap. 12. tractans il∣lum locum Psalm. 98. [Adorate Scabellum pedum ejus.] Per Scabellum terra intelligitur, per tertam autem caro Christi, quam hodiè quoque in mysterijs adoramus: & quam Apostoli in Domino Iesu adoraverunt. Ob. 1. per Bellarm. Apol. cap. 8. pag. 107. Hic locus nullam admittit solutionem. Item lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 14. Wee adore in these mysteries the flesh of Christ, as the footstoole of his Deity. You call this an Argument infallible: nay (say wee) but false, because Ambrose doth not say, that wee adore the Sacra∣ment, (which is the point in Question) but that in our mysticall Celebration of the memory of Christ his Passion, wee are to adore his Humanity, namely as it is hypostatically united to the person of his God-head, which all Christians professe as well as you, yea even in Baptisme also. II. Ob.August. in Psalm. 98. Nemo illam earnem manducat, nisi prius adoraverit. Ob. Bellarm. Alius locus insignis. Lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 24. §. Alius. None (saith Augustine) doth eat the flesh of Christ before hee adore it. A Te∣stimony which seemeth to you Notable: but which wee judge to be indeed not able at all to prove the Divine Adoration of the Sacrament, even in the Iudgement of Saint Augustine, who hath every-where distinguished betweene the Sacrament and Christs Flesh, as betweene Bread and Christs Body, as hath beene of∣ten demonstrated. His meaning therefore is no more but this, that whosoever shall communicate of this Sacrament, the Symboll of Christ must first be a true Christian, believing that Christ is not onely man, but God also, and adore him ac∣cordingly with Divine honour, as well before and without the
Sacrament, as at the receiving thereof. Even as  E∣dit. Paris. 1027. , speaking of Baptisme, saith that The Catechumenists do adore the Father and the Sonne, but they are not perfect before they are bap∣tized in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Ho∣ly Ghost. So Athanasius. Consider the words well, the Cate∣chumenists are said not to be perfect, before they are baptized in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, whom they adore. Therfore did they first adore the Persons, in whose names they were baptized: except some will feigne a Christian Catechu∣menist to be admitted to holy Baptisme before hee believe and professe that hee believeth; which is the Adoration of the Blessed Trinity. And is there any of your Priests so unchri∣stian, as not to adore Christ, before hee come to the Commu∣nion? A plaine Case. {fleur-de-lys} Notwithstanding, were it that the Adoration, above objected out of Saint Augustine, should referre to the time of the Celebration of the Eucharist; yet will hee not admit of any other Veneration therein, then what may be held as well in the Sacrament of Baptisme; hee requring that in both these theAugust. de doctrin Christia lib. 3. cap. 8.  intelligit, non hoc veneratur quod videtur & transit, sed illud portius, quô  cuncta referenda suit—Paulo post; Sicut est  Sacramentum & ce∣libratio Corporis Christi, quae uns∣quisque cûm percipit quo referantur im∣butus agnoscit, ut ea non cornali servitute, sed spirituali  libertate venetur.—Vt  & sign  significatis . Veneration be not applyed to the Sacrament it selfe, but to the things signifyed thereby. Which Doctrine of Saint Augustine may serve for an  as against all other Idolatrous infections, so against your Objection, taken from the false conceipts of Pagans; as if they had approved of the false Adoration used by Christians, thinking that they had adored the Sacrament, as they themselvesSee above Booke 5. Chap. 6. Sect. 3. adored Ce∣res and Bacchus. But those godly Christians (you know) did not adore the Bread and Wine: Therefore could not this be applyable to the matter in Controversie. {fleur-de-lys} Will you have any more? The places alleged out of Saint Augustine, by you, are like Bellerophons Letters, to confute you; for lest Saint Augustines Reader might mis-construe the mea∣ning of Christs words, by perverting them to a Corporall and Orall eating of his Flesh,August. in  98. Non hoc corpus quod videris munducaturi estis—spiritual ter intelle∣ctum vivisic wit. Saint Augustine addeth (bringing Christ speaking to the Iewes, concerning the eating of his lesh) You are not to eat this flesh, which you see: hee saith not, You are not to see the flesh which you shall eat, (which is your Romish Iugling:) But thus, You are not to eat the flesh which you see, namely that, which then was visible when Christ was in the world. This one Testimonie of Augustine may satisfie for the present, untill another shall be delivered from him absolutely See  Chap. 4. Sect. 2. confuting your Tridentine Faith of the Divine worship of the Host, to prove it Idolatrous. {fleur-de-lys} II. Ob. Ambrose furthermore requireth, that the Communicant come with Feare, and a minde knowing that Dr. Heskins in his Parlium Booke 3. Chap. 57 out of Ambrose. Devoto animi & cum timore acceden∣dum ad Communionem docet, ut sciat mens reverentiam debere ei, ad cujus corpus umendum accedit.
hee oweth reverence to him, whose Body hee commeth to receive. Which words your Doctor calleth Plaine termes. Sol. And so indeed they are, for proofe of an Adoration to Christ, who is spiritually received in our receiving this Sacrament: ut not to the Sacrament it selfe, as unto the very person of Christ. Yea, and the same Reverence wee also professe to be likewise due unto Christ, even in the hearing of his holy word. {fleur-de-lys} III. Ob. Theodoret seemeth unto you to come off roundly, saying thatTheod. Dial. 2. Signa mystica post sanctificationem ma∣nent in priore sub∣stantiâ, figurâ, & formâ, sicut prius: Intelliguntur autem ea, quae facta sunt, & creduntur: [] adoran∣tur. Ob: Bellarm. lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 27. § Sed apertissimè—Ast praesentiam Domini in Euchari∣stia, quia panis con∣secratus est verè id quod intelligitur, cre∣ditur & adoratur. Symbols and Signes are believed and adored, whereby hee most evidently teacheth the presence of Christ's flesh (as saith your Cardinall:) even so, as commonly hee useth to do in alleging of other Testimonies, both unconscionably against his knowledge, and unluckily against his Cause. For with what Conscience can hee urge the word Adoration here, as most evi∣dently noting a Divine worship of the Sacrament, seeing that hee hath before confessed the same word, Adore, to be used of the Fa∣thers, sometimes for worship communicable to Angels, & Saints, and to their Tombes? yea, and when as also Theodoret (which proveth your Cardinals Objection lucklesse) doth expresly say, that The substance of Bread remaineth, meaning absolutely the proper substance of Bread (as hath beeneSee this dis∣cussed to the full. Booke 3. copiously proved) whereunto no Divine worship can be lawfully given, not onely in the Faith of all other Catholike Fathers; but even in the be∣liefe of the Romane Church at this day? And although the Symbols, and Signes (as you fancie) were meere Accidents, yet dare not you your selves say that they are to be properly adored with Divine Worship. Hitherto have we insisted upon the words objected out of the Fathers, by you, with more eagernesse, than either with good Iudgement or Conscience. Your next Objections are taken from their Acts, whereunto wee ad∣dresse our Answers.
CHAP. III. That no objected Act out of the Fathers, for proofe of an Invocation by Divine Adoration of the Eucharist, is conscionably alleged; not the first, which is their pre∣scribed Concealment of this Mysterie. SECT. I. ACts insisted upon by you, for proofe of Adoration; are these; The Fathers injoyning a Concealment of this Mysterie from some others: their Elevation of the Host after Consecration: their Cautelousnesse in administring it, without letting any part thereof fall to the ground: their Bodily Gesture in token of Humiliation; and their pretended Invocating on it. Wee acknowledge (that wee may begin with the first) how strictly often times the Ancient Fathers generally prescribed to others, (which they observed themselves) that this Mysterie should be kept secret from all per∣sons, who were not initiated by Baptisme, and incorporated ther∣by into the visible Church of Christ, were they Infidels or Ca∣techumenists (that is) unbaptized Christians. Vpon this our Confession, as the Base, hearken what a discant your Doctors can chant, saying as followeth;Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 2. ciiat Au∣gustin Serm. 10. de verbis Apostol. viz. Quod corpus dixit es∣cam, & sanguinem potum, Sacramentum fidelium agnoscunt fideles—Be hanc phrasin [nôrunt fide∣les] habet in locis in∣finitis: at profectò non est fidelibus tan∣tùm notum, quòd corpus Christi fide percipiatur. Idem. Ob∣jicit Claudius de San∣ctes ante lib. de Litur∣gijs patrum. Rursus Bellar qui sup. cap. 15. At certè nulla reddi potest causa, cur Eu∣charistiam ne videri quidem permitterent Infidelibus, vel etiam Catechumenis, si ni∣hil est nisi signum. The Fathers said of this my∣sterie of the Eucharist that onely [Fideles nôrunt] the Faithfull know it: and therefore wee must be perswaded they understood a Corporall Presence of Christ herein; and consequently a Divine Adoration due unto it. Master Brerely swelleth big, in amplify∣ing this Objection; take a brief of the whole. The Fathers profes∣sing to write more circumspectly of this Sacrament, so as not daring to explaine it, as Theodoret, Origen, Augustine, Chrysostome; this were causlesse, if the Fathers had thought Christ's words figurative: nor had it beene more necessary in this than in Baptisme, had the Fa∣thers acknowledged no other presence in this, than in Baptisme, &c. So hee; and so also your IrishMr. Mllon in his Reply, pag 221. Iesuite. Well then, by your owne judgement, if it may be found that the Eathers observed a like Circumspection in the maner of utte∣ring, and Cautelousnesse in concealing the Sacrament of Baptisme from Infidels and Catechumenists; then must you confesse that this your Argument maketh no more for proofe of a Corporall Presence in the Eucharist, as you would have it, than in Baptisme, where you confesse it is no. And now behold the Fathers are as precise in concealing the Mysterie of Baptisme, from all persons unbaptized, even in as expresse termes as was spoken of in the
Eucharist; Chrysostome saying, (against such Persons)Chrysost. in Gal. 4. Non natura, sed Dei promissio Sacra∣mentum fecit: sic re∣nascentia nostra na∣tura quidem nulla est, caeterum verbum Dei, . The faithfull know this. And againe, entring into a discourse of Bap∣tisme, he prefaceth saying;And againe in 1. Cor. Hom. 40. about to entreat of the words of S. Paul, [Quid fa∣cientij, qui baptizan∣tur pro mortuis? [ {fleur-de-lys} And yet againe, in Ioh. 85. Hom. 33. joy∣ning that Contempla∣tion of Baptisme and of the Eucharist to∣gether, hee saith; . id est, Initi∣ati. {fleur-de-lys} I would indeed speake this plainly, but I dare not, because of them that are not initiated, or Baptized. {fleur-de-lys} Basil also, speaking of the Rites of Baptisme, saith that Basil. de Spir. Sanct. Cap. 27. Con∣secrare oleum uncti∣onis, hominem ter mergi, renuntiare Sa∣tanae, & reliqua eti∣am in Baptismo, un∣de habemus? nonnè ex antiqua traditio∣ne? nonnè ex doctri∣na, quam Patres in silentio, quod curio∣sos & otiosos sub∣movet, servârunt? The Ancient Fathers (before his time) left them in silence; and preserved them from curious and idle men. {fleur-de-lys} And Diony∣sius, the supposed Areopagite,Dionys. Hierar. cap. 2. . Let none that is not a perfect Christian be admitted to the sight of the signes of Baptisme: even as the CouncellCon. Araun. 1. Catechumeni non sunt ad Baptismum admittendi. Can. 19. Arausicanum also decreed. Which Cautions are long since antiquated by disuse in Churches Christian, be∣cause all are now baptized that come to behold this Sacrament. If hereupon any Protestant shall inferre a Corporall Presence of Christ in Baptisme, and consequently an Adoration of Christ in the same Sacrament, you your selves (wee know) would but hisse at him, in detestation of his Consequence, as judging it Idolatrous. But do you aske, why then the Fathers did teach Christians not to speake of these Mysteries in the hearing of the Catechume∣nists? Saint Augustine himselfe (whom your Cardinall hath brought in for defence of Corporall Presence) will resolve us, and witnesse against him, telling him, not that the reason was the sub∣limity of the matter, as though they could not apprehend it, but becauseAug. Tom. 9. Tract.  in Ioh. Quid si eis fidelium Sacramenta non producuntur, non ideo fit, quod ea ferre non possent, sed ut ab  tan∣tò ardentiùs concupiscantur, quantò honorabilius eis occultantur. [Speaking of the Catechumenists.] The more honourably the Sacraments are concealed (spea∣king in generall) the more ardently they would be coveted and desi∣red. As for their not revealing them unto Infidels, the reason is evident; Infidelity is a mocker, and they meant to preserve Christs Sacrament from contempt. Thus your most specious Objection serveth for nothing more than to prove your Disputers to be wonderfully precipitant in their Arguing. That the objected Elevation, or lifting up of the Hoast, and preserving of it from falling, are no Arguments of Divine Adoration. SECT. II. SEcondly, the Elevation of the Hoast over the head of the Priest is your ordinary Objection, for proofe of a Divine Adoration; although you haveSuarez. See above Book 6. Ch. 1. Sect. 5. at (a.) confessed, that this was not of prime Anti∣quity. But supposing Elevation to have been so ancient, yet was it not to the end it should be adored, no more than was the Booke of the Gospel, in the Roman Church, when it was (according to
the Rite thenDurant. de Ritib. lib. . cap. 23 num. 7 In ordine Romano Diaconus osculans E∣vangelium, levat in manus codscem, & partem ejus in dex∣tro humero ponens, vadit ad Ambonem. Lift up by the hands of the Deacon, and carried on his right shoulder. What else will you say of the Priests elevation? you would perswade (in theIdem de Ritibus l. 2. cap. 40. in Psal 71.

Margin) by some, that the Priest lifting the Hoast over his head, was prophesied of by the Psal∣mist; And, that the Rite of holding the Hoast up was chiefly, that the people knowing it to be now consecrated, should understand that Christ is on the Altar, whom they are to adore by falling downe on the ground. Whereof albeit some of you speak more confident∣ly, yet the most principall searcher into Antiquity dare say no more, than onely This is probable. Wee contrarily conceive, 1. that that Rabbinish interpretation can be no good ground to rest upon, whichSee above, B. 3. hath bin rejected by Bellarmine, as being idle and frivolous. 2. That the Ceremony of Elevation (as hathSee above, B. 6. Chap. 4. Sect. 5. beene confessed) was neither instituted by Christ, nor yet alwaies in use in Christ's Church. 3. That the same Elevation, albeit used after Consecration, doth not so much as Pro∣bably prove it was for Adoration-sake, because it was aswell in use in your lifting up of the Hoast before Consecration; as your ob∣jected Missals published by Claudius Sanctes a Parisian Doctor, be∣fore Consecration, in the Missal of S. Iames, Attollens: In the Masse of Basil. Exal∣tans panem. Missals of Saint Iames, and Basil do manifest. Lastly, that where Elevation was practised after Consecration, the obje∣cted Authors confute your Assertion, for in Chrysostome (if wee should grant unto you the whole Liturgie to be his, which the best learned Grecians at this day do, &c. deny) it is read,After Consecration in the Masse of Chry∣sostome. Modicum at∣tollens Sacerdos, di∣cit Sancta sanctis. That the Priest did take a portion out of the dish, and held it up but a little: this is not lifting it over the head, or very high, as your reason for Adoration would require. And in your objected S.In Dionys. Areop∣relating the forme of their Mosse, objected by Durantus de Ritib. lib. 2. cap. 40.

Denis there is no more, but that The sacred celebrated Symbols were brought into light, which after Consecration hee termeth Vn∣covered Bread, divided of the Priest into many parts. Bread (wee say) broken after Consecration; which is the break-necke of your whole Defence. {fleur-de-lys} And why may not wee thinke the Elevation, for Adora∣tion of the Host, to be an after-Invention, aswell as was the Ele∣vation of the Chalice for the same end? whereof it is confessed by your owne Ritualist, thatBarthol.

The elevation of the Chalice, that the people might adore it, was not commanded untill after the daies of Thomas Aquinas. So hee; and that (you know) was a thousand and some hundreth of yeares after Christ his Institution of this Sacrament. It were strange, if the Romish
Faith had then been, that the Blood of Christ, beeing Corpo∣rally in the Sacrament, and Consequently adored of the peo∣ple, that the Primitive Church should not have used an Eleva∣tion of the Cup, for better Accommodation-sake, aswell as your new Romish Church hath ordained so many Ages since. Not to tell you of the Church under Prester-Iohn, which (as isCassand. in Li∣turg. cap. 11. Sacer∣dos sublevet, Id ip∣sum quoque facit in Calice, sed non ele∣vat. confessed) used no Elevation. {fleur-de-lys} Your third Objection is the diligent Caution given by Ancient Fathers, to take heedTertull. in lib. de Corona milit.

Take heed no little crumme fall to the ground. Tract. 4. Sect. . And, Pius Bishop of Rome or∣dained that the con¦serated Bread and Wine falling to the ground should be left to the Sacrificer, and the rest remaining should be burnt with fire unto ashes. So great a Reverence was then prescribed. Ibid. Tract. 2. Sect 8. Subd 4. {fleur-de-lys} Bell. li. 2. de Euch. ca 7.

So you. Pha∣raoh his Butler and Baker, we are sure, would have been loath to miscarry in spilling, or letting fall any part of their carriage, when they were to present their service unto their King; much more carefully ought every Christian, in executing his sacred Function, to observe the Lawes of Decorum. Marke we, by the way, Master Brerely durst not call the part falling any thing but a Part, not A part of Christ's Body, that were Impious, not a part of Accidents, that were absurd: what meaneth the childish Fa∣bling trow wee, but that if they should speake out, they should betray their Cause, in calling that little part a part of Bread, as your objected Dionysius spake? And when all is said, wee heare no proofe of Divine Adoration of the Host. But we leave you to take your Answer from your Salmeron, who hath told you that See above, B. 1. Chap 3. Sect. 10. in Answer to the second pretence. Casuall spilling of the Cup is no sinne. {fleur-de-lys} Howbeit, wee aske you, whether it were a Veniall sin in your Cardinall, to allege the words of Tertullian, as spoken of the Bread and Wine in the Eucharist, which, by the judge∣ment of your owneGabriel Epis. Albisp. lib. 2. Obser∣vat. 35. in lib. Tert. ad uxorem [Calicis & panis nostrialiquid in terram decuti anxiè patimur.] Pameliusin eum locum. Quod addit (inquit) panis nostri, facit ad distin∣ctionem Bucharistiae Sacramenti, in quo non calix & panis communis proponutur. And the Bishop himselfe; Tertul. laudat aetatis suae morem, quo aegrè ferebant si casu communis panis & vini aliquid in terram exciderit. Authors were spoken of Common and ordinary Bread and Wine? It were well that this kind of over∣sight both in Cardinall Bellarmine and Master Brerely were not in them a fault Common and ordinarie. Howsoever wee could tell you, that if the hazard were so great, as your Ob∣jections imply, namely, that any subject matter of Adoration had been believed to be in it, than was the holy Bishop Exu∣perius (whom notwithstanding Saint Hierome commendeth) much blameable forHier. ad Rustic. cap. 4. commending the Bp. Exuperius. Nihil de illo dicimus, qui corpus in canistro, & sanguinem portabat in vi∣tro. Carrying it in a Glasse. And much more condemnable should that godly Pope Zephyrinus have beeneDe Consec. D. 1. C. Vasa.—Zepherinus Episcopus patenis vitrcis Missas celebrare constituit. Who ordained that the Masse should be celebrated in Chalices of Glasse; which the more brittle they were, the more solidly they confirme unto us this Truth, that Antiquity har∣boured not your beliefe of a Corporall Presence of Christ in this Sacrament. {fleur-de-lys}
Only we must againe insist in the former Observation, to wit, the frequent speeches of the Fathers, telling s of Crums, Frag∣ments, little parts of this Sacrament; and of Burning them into ashes, after the Celebration ended. Now answer us, in good sad∣nesse; was it ever heard of, we say not of ancient Fathers, but of any professing Christianity, were the Catholikes or Heretikes, who would not have judged it most execrible for any to say, or thinke that A crum, or little part of Christ's Body falleth? or that by a dash of the Cup, the Blood of our Lord is spilt or that the Pri∣mitive Fathers, in the Remainder of the Sacrament, Burned their Saviour? Yet these must they both have thought, and said, if (as you speake of Eating, Swallowing, feeding Corporally on Christ's Body) the Body of Christ were the proper Subject of these acci∣dentall Events. That the Objection taken from any Gesture, used in the daies of Antiquity, doth not prove a Divine Adoration of the Eucharist. SECT. III. GEsture is one of the points, which you object, as more ob∣servable than the former, but how? because Chrysostome will have the Communicant take it withChrysost: in Li∣turg Posteà similiter Sacerdos sumit san∣ctum panem, inclina∣to capite ante sacram mensam orans. Inclining his head downe before the holy Table. Cyril, byCyril. Hieros. My∣stag. 5. Accede. ad ca∣licem sanguinis illius pronus [.] Bowing after the maner of A∣doring. You will be still like your selves, insisting upon Htero∣genies, and Arguments which conclude not ad idem. For first, the Examples objected speake not of Bowing downe to the Sacrament, but of our Bowing downe our heads to the ground, in signification of our Vnworthinesse; which may be done in Adoring Christ with a [Sursum corda] that is, Listing up our hearts to Christ above. And this may become every Christian to use, and may be done without Divine Adoration of the thing before us. Nay, and that no Gesture, either Standing, Sitting, or Kneeling, is necessary for such an Adoration, your greatest. Advocate doth shew out of Antiquity, and affirmeth this as a Point (asEspencaeus. Nec disputatio super Ado∣randi gestu, cum de Adorationis substan∣tia inter omnes sem∣per convenerit, ac etiamnum convenit, stantes aut sedentes, proni aut supini, ere∣cti aut geniculati, Christum in Euchari∣stia praesentissimum adoremus, per se non refert—cùm A∣doratio non tam in externo cultu, quàm intimo mentis affectu cernitur. Lib. 2. de A∣dorat cap. 16. initio. he saith) agreed on by all; adding that Divine Adoration consisteth not in the outward Gesture, but in the Intention of the mind. For, indeed, there is no one kind of outward Gesture, which (as you have con∣fessed) is not also communicable to man: so that although that were true, which is set down in that Rubrick ofThe Latine is, In∣clinantes Altari: but since I finde it in the Greeke (before Conse∣cration) ; and so thrice the like. Af∣ter Consecration;  [Behinde the Table bowing downe his head.] And againe . Chrysostomes Li∣turgie, that the Ministers did use to Incline their Bodies to the ho∣ly Table, yet none can be so simple to thinke that they did yield Divine honour unto the Table. Nay, your owne great Master of CeremoniesDurant Per∣actâ thurificatione, Sacerdos levite incurvescit ante Altare—dum autem inclinat Sacerdos, humilitatem Christi significat.—Sacerdos reflexus ad Altare, cum paratur Consecratio.

Observat. sacr. lib. 1. Observ. 12. professedly discussing this Point. This being knowne, how can you in any credibility conclude, as you have done, a Corporall presence of Christ in this Sacrament after Consecration, from a Reverence which hath been yielded to the same Sacrament, before it was consecrated? In which consi∣deration your Disputers stand so much the more condemnable, because, whereas they shew some Examples of a Bodily Incli∣ning to the Sacrament, done before Consecration, yet after Conse∣cration they have not produced any one. But what newes now? We blush, in your behalfe, to repeat the Instance which you have out of your Legends, of aMr. Brerely Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 9. Subd. 3. [Out of Bel∣larm. and Bellar. out of Antoninus.]—When (not unlike to the reproofe which God miraculously gave to Balaam by the speech of an Asse) a bruit-beast for our instruction did prostrate him∣selfe in reverence be∣fore the blessed Sa∣crament. Brute Beast prostrating it selfe before the Host, and doing Reverence unto it. Wee would have concealed this, but that you seeme to glory herein, as being for your Instruction, like to the reproofe given mira∣culously to Balaam by his Asse. Well might this Legend have be∣come that latter time of darknesse, wherein it was first hatched, but not these cleare daies, wherein your mysteries of Delusions have beene so often revealed, and when all Christians almost in all Countries have taken knowledge of anBANKS HIS HORSE; according to his Masters owne Re∣lation. Horse taught by Art to kneele to any person at his Masters command; and once in France, when, by the Suggestion and Instigation of Romish Priests, his Master was called into question for Sorcerie, hee for vindication of his credit with them, commanded his Horse to kneele before a Crucifix, and therby freed himselfe from suspition of Diabolicall familiarity, according to the Principles of their owne superstition. And for any one to conclude this to have bin Gods miraculous work in that Horse, (as the other was in that Asse) would seeme to be the reason of an unreasonable man; because all Miracles alwaies exceed all power both of Art, and Nature; else were they no Miracles at all. Thus to your fourth Objection from outward Acts, we passe on to Examples. That no Example of Invocation, objected out of Antiquity, can inferre the Divine Honour of the Sacrament, as is pretended. SECT. IV. YOur Instances are Three; the principall in Gorgonia, the Si∣ster of Gregory Nazianzen, in whose Oration, at her Fune∣rall,
we find thatGreg. Nazian. Orat. 11 de Gorgonia. Soror Gorgonia ad∣versà corporis valetu∣dine laborabat—eratque prodigiosum morbi genus, quod nec medicorum arte, nec parentum lachry∣mis, nec publicis pre∣cibus sanari potuit: desperatis omnibus alijs auxilijs intem∣pestà nocte captatâ ad Altare cum side procumbit, eumque qui super isto hono∣ratur ingenti clamore invocans, cum caput suū part cum clamo∣re Altari admovisset, & deinde hoc phar∣maco (i.e. Lachryma∣rum, ut exponit Elias Cretensis) perfudisset, & si quid uspiam [] Antity∣porū preciosi Corpo∣ris & Sanguinis ma∣nu recondrderat, ad lachrymis admiscurs∣set (ô rem admiran∣dam!) statim se mor∣bo liberatam sentit. She having been troubled with a prodigious dis∣ease, after that neither the Art of Physick, nor teares of her Parents, nor the publike Prayers of the Church could procure her any health, went and cast her selfe downe at the Altar, Invocating Christ, who is honoured on the Altar, saying that she would not remove her head from the Altar, untill shee had received her health: when (Oh admi∣able event!) she was presently freed from her dsease. This is the Story set downe by Gregory Nazianen. Hence your Cardinall concludeth, that Gorgonia invocated the Sacrament, as being the very Body and Blood of Christ, and calleth this An hot and stinging Argument; and so indeed it may be named, yet onely in respect of them, whose consciences are scorched, or stung with their owne guiltinesse of in forcing and injuring the Story, as will now appeare. For first, why should wee thinke that she invocated the Sacra∣ment? Because (saith yourBellar. Procum∣bens ante Altare co∣rā venerabili Sacra∣mento—Quid autem super altare colatur, dubium esse non po∣test, cum nihil ibi po∣natur nisi Panis & Vinum, mutanda in corpus & sanguinem Christi—Petium Martyrē valdè ussit pupugitque hic locus. Lib. 2. de Euch cap 14 Cardinall) she prostrated her selfe at the Altar, before the Sacrament; which words [Before the Sacra∣ment] are of his owne coyning, and no part of the Story. His next reason; Because she is said to have invocated him, who is hono∣red on the Altar. As though every Christian praying at the Table of the Lord, to Christ, may not be justly said to Invocate him, who is used to be Honoured by the Priest, celebrating the memory of Christ thereon. Nay, and were it granted, that the Sacramentall Symbols had beene then on the Altar, yet would it not follow, that she invocated the Sacrament, as betokening a Corporall pre∣sence of Christ (as your Disputers have fancied) no more than if the said godly woman upon the same occasion presenting her selfe at the sacred Font, wherin she had beene baptized, could be thought to have invocated the water therein; because she was said to have invocated him, who is honoured in the Administration of Baptisme. And furthermore it is certaine, that the Remainders of the Sacrament in those daies were kept in their Pastophorium, aSee above, Book 4. Chap. 1. Sect. 10. As further also appeareth in the Liturgie of pope Clement; Acci∣piant Diacont reli∣quias, & portent in Pastophoria (Doubt∣lesse from the Altar to a place remote.) Teste pamelio Tom 1 Missal. Patrion La∣tin. pag 118. place severed from the Altar, especially at this time of her being there, which was in the Night, as the Story speaketh. O! but she was cured of her disease at the Altar. And so were other miraculous Cures wrought also at the Font ofSee above, Book 4. Chap.  Sect. 5. Baptisme. But, for a Conclusion, wee shal willingly admit of Gregory Nazi∣anzen to be Vmpier betweene us. He, in relating the Story, saith of the Sacrament of the Eucharist; Orat. 11. quo supra. If shee at the time of her invocating had laid up any part of the Antitypes (or Sym∣bols) of the precious Body and Blood of Christ, that shee mingled with her teares. So hee, calling the consecrated Sacrament Antitypes, or Signes of Christ's Body: therby signifying, that the Sacrament is not the Body and Blood of Christ, as hath beenBooke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. pro∣ved unto you at large out of Nazianzen, and other Greeke Fa∣thers,
Whereas if indeed he had meant that the Body and Blood of Christ had beene there corporally present, as that which was Invocated; then now (if ever) it had concerned this holy Father to have expresly delivered his supposition thus, viz. If she had at that time of her Invocating laid up any whit of the precious Body and Blood of Christ. Wee say of the Body and Blood of Christ, and not (as hee said) of the Antitypes, or Signes of his Body and Blood. Thus is your hot and stinging Reason become chilly, cold, and altogether dronish. Your second Instance is in Dionysius the Areopagite, who wri∣ting of the SacramentBellar. Dio∣nys. Areop. Hier. cap. 3. part. 3. O divinis∣simum & sacrosan∣ctum Sacramentum, obducta tibi signifi∣cancium signorum o∣perimenta aperi, &c. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 3. Item ipsum invocat Sacramentum, & pe∣tit ab ipso, quae à solo Deo rectè peti pos∣sunt. And, Durant. de Rit ib. lib. 2. cap. 11. Aud indeed who not? said, O must divine Sacrament, reveale union us the mysterie of thy signes, &c. which in the eares of your Disputers ringeth a flat Invocation of the Sacrament: {fleur-de-lys} And thatMallon. Ies. in his Reply. Nothing could be said more plainly. {fleur-de-lys} Contrariwise wee confidently affirme, that your Teachers have taken a figure Prosopopoeia for Invocation; like men who take Moon-shine for Day-light, as wee shall manifest by Examples, Confessions, yea and the very Instance of Dionysius himselfe. Prosopopoeia then is a figure, when one calleth upon that which hath no sense, as if it had sense; as when in Scripture the Pro∣phet said, Heare ô Heavens, and hearken ô Earth, Isa. 1. In like maner, among the Ancient Fathers, one called upon his owne Church Anastasia, whence he was to depart, and saying thus, Nazian. Orat. 32. . Oh Anastasia, which hast restored our Doctrine, when it was de∣spised! Others of the Element of Baptisme, thus: Oh water that hath washed our Saviour, and deserved to be a Sacrament! or thus, Ambros. in Luc. lib. 10. cap. 22. O aqua, tu aspersum sanguine (Christum) lavisti, Sacramentum Christi esse meruisti, &c. Oh water which once purged the world, yea (as another) and na∣ming itOptat. lib. 6. cont. Parmē. O aqua, quae & purum feceras orbē, & terrā lavisti. Greg. Nyssen. Divinū lavacrum, See above, Booke 3. C. 3. §. 13. A Divine Lavacre, &c. Nay, you your selves can sing, & chant it to the Crosse,O salve Crux, spes unica! auge piis justitiā, &c. Est Pro∣sopopoeia. Vasquez. Ies. lib. 2. de Adorat. Disp. 9. cap. 4. pag. 445. Oh Crosse our only hope, &c. and in expounding the same, allow no more than a Prosopopoeia and figurative speech, lest that otherwise your Invocation may be judged Idolatrous. And wheras in another Romish Anthem it is sung of the Eucharist, Oh holy Feast! This Saying (saith ano∣ther O sacrum cō∣vivium! quod omni Sacramento conve∣nit. Tolet. Ies. Instruct. Sacerd. lib. 2. cap. 15. pag. 366. Iesuite) agreeth to every Sacrament. Thus have you heard both from Fathers, and from your selves the like Tenour of In∣vocation; Oh Church! Oh Water! Oh Crosse! Oh Feast! nothing differing from Dionysius his Oh Divine Sacrament! yet each one without any proper Invocation at all. And that you may further understand, that this Dionysius his OH! is as in voyce, so in sense the same which we judge it to be, what better Interpreter can you require of this Greeke Author Dionysius, than was his Greeke Scholiast Pachymeres? who hath given his Iudgement of this very speech directly, saying that Pachym. in locum Dionys. . Ex Orat. 42. It was spoken as of a thing having life, and that fitly, as did Na∣zianzen, saith he; O great and holy Pascha, &c. And how should this be otherwise? seeing Dionysius, at the writing hereof, was not in any Church or place, where the Eucharist was celebrated,
but privately contemplating in his mind upon this holy Myste∣rie. The due consideration of these your former so frivolous, and so false Objections provoketh us to cry out, saying, Oh So∣phistry, Sophistry! when wilt thou cease to delude the soules of men? In which maner of speech, notwithstanding, wee do not Invocate, but rather detest, and abominate your Romish Sophi∣stry. And lest any of you should stumble upon the Attribute, which Dionysius giveth to the Eucharist, in calling it a Divine Sa∣crament, as if it should imply a Corporall Presence therein, reade but one Chapter of the same Author, and hee will teach you to say as much of many other things, wherein you will not believe any Corporall Existence of Christ, we are sure: for there he equal∣ly nameth the place of Celebration,See above Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect 13. Divine Altar; the Sacra∣mental Signes, Divine Symbols; the Minister, Divine Priest; the Communicants, Divine People; yea and (which may muzzle eve∣ry Opponent) the matter of this Sacrament, Divine Bread. In the third place is objected this saying of Basil; When the Bread is shewne, what holy Father hath left in writing the words of Invocation? Thus that Father, whence your Father Bellarmine thus;Basii de Spir. sanct. cap. 2 [Verba Invocationis, cùm o∣stenditur, quis San∣ctorum in scripto no∣bis reliquit?] Hunc habemus morem ve∣teris Ecclesiae, ut post consecrationē osten∣deretur populo Eu∣charistia, quod nunc fieri videmus, & con∣ceptis verbis invoca∣retur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2 de Euch. cap. 25 §. Al∣terum. And Durant. de Ritib. lib 2. cap. 11. Planè ab ipsis Eccle∣siae incunabilis post Consecrationem Eu∣charistiam in altum tollere, Dionys. & Ba∣sil. de Spiritu Sancto, cap. 27, &c. Hence know we the Custome of the ancient Church, namely, that the Eucharist is shewne to the people after Consecration. And that Then (as we see now done among us) it was Invocated upon, even plainly after Consecration, saith your Durantus also, and indeed al∣most who not? But do you first, if you please, admire the wit of your Cardinall in so framing his Consequence, and after abhor his will to deceive you, when you have done: for he applieth the words, spoken by Basil of an Invocation before Conscration, (when as yet, by your owne Doctrine, Christ is not present) as spo∣ken of an Invocation of the Eucharist after Consecration; for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ therein, and the Divine Adoration thereof, as will most evidently appeare. For first it is not unknown to you, that the Greeke Church differeth from your Roman in the forme of Consecration at this day, they consecrating in words of prayer, and Invocation, and you in the repetition of Christ's words [This is my Body] wherein there isBroved above, Book 1. Ch. 2. Sect. 3. in the Challenge. no Invocati∣on at all. And Basil was of the Greeke Church. Secondly, your Archiep. Caesari∣ens. seu Christoph. de Capite fontium, Tra∣ctat. var. Sacerdos in∣vocando Deum panē consecravit: Hanc a∣lij, ut Tertull. Iren. Iustin. Gratiarum a∣ctionē hujusmodi In∣vocationem seu be∣nedictionem vocant. pag. 34. Alicubi The∣odoret Basil. Cyril. Hierosol. Iren. Da∣mascen. Theoph. A∣lex. vocant Euchari∣stiae formam . Invocationem. Ibid. pag. 33. And hee allegeth your Linda∣nus for a Suffragator in this point. Archbishop of Caesarea, for proofe that Invocation by prayers was a forme of Consecration used primitively in the Greeke Church, citeth the two most ancient Fathers, Tertullian and Irenaeus; and of the Greeke he allegeth Iustine, Cyril, Damas∣cen, Theophilus Alex. yea, and (by your leave) Basil himselfe too: and that Basil was an Orthodoxe Greeke Father you will not deny. Thirdly, therfore (to come home unto you) wee shall be di∣rected by the Objected words of Basil himselfe, appealing here∣in to your owne consciences. For your Lindanus was, in the estimation of your Church, the strongest Champion in his time
for your Romane Cause; he, to prove that the forme of Conse∣cratio, of the Eucharist standeth not in any prescribed words in the Gospel, but in words of Invocation by prayer (asSee Booke 1. Chap. 2. hath been confirmed by a Torrent of Ancient Fathers) saith,Paulus non tradidit formā Con∣secrationis, quod Ba∣silius ità illustrat, ut sano capiti nihil ad haec sit ullo modo re∣quirendum amplius, cap. 42. de Spir. san∣cto; Verba, dùm o∣stenditur panis (in∣quit) & poculum be∣nedictionis, quis San∣ctorū nobis reliquit? Lindan. Panop. lib. 4. cap. 41. That the same is illustrated by these words of Basil, saying, What Fa∣ther hath left unto us i writing the words of Invocation, when the Bread is shewne unto us? adding, That no man of sound Braines can require any more, for the clearing of the point concerningth forme of Consecration. So then, Invocation was an Invocation by Pray∣er unto God, for the Consecration of the Bread let before them, and not an Invocation of Adoration unto the Eucharist, as alrea∣dy consecrated; which your Cardinal unconscionably (wee will not say, unlearnedly) hath enforced. Looke upon the Text againe, for your better satisfaction; It speaketh expresly of an Invocation, when Bread is shewne: but you deny that Bread is Invocated upon, untill after Consecration. And Basils demanding [What Father before us hath left in writing the words of Invocation?] is, in true and genuine sense, as if hee had expresly said, what Father before us hath left in writing the words of Invocating God by Prayer of Consecration of Bread, to make it a Sacrament? as both the Testimonies of Fathers above confessed manifest, and your objected Greeke Missals do ratifie unto us. For, in the Liturgie ascribed to SaintLiturg. Iac. [Sancte Domine, &c.] Iames the Apostle, the Consecration is by Invocating and praying thus, Holy Lord who dwellest in holiest &c. The Li∣turgie ofLiturg. Chry∣sost. [Adhuc offeri∣mus—mitte Spiri∣tum, &c.] Chrysstome Invocateth by praying; Wee beseech thee, O Lord, to send thy Spirit upon these Gifts prepared before us, &c. The Liturgie under the name ofLiturg. Ba∣sil. [Respice Domi∣ne.] Basil consecrateth by this Invocation, when the Priest lifteth up the Bread, Looke downe, O Lord Iesu our God, from thy holy habitation, and vouch∣safe, &c. All these therefore were according to the Example of Christ) Invocations, that is, Prayers of Consecrating the Sacra∣ment; and therefore could not be Invocations of Adoration of the same Sacrament. {fleur-de-lys} Which Invocation, in Consecrating by Prayer,Cyril. Hiero. sol. Mystag. Catech. 3. . Cyril calleth an Invocation of the holy Tri∣nity. {fleur-de-lys} And as for any expresse or prescribed forme or pray∣er to be used of All, well might Basil say, Who hath set it downe in writing? that is, It was never delivered either in Scripture, or in the Bookes of any Author of former Antiquity; and this is that which is testified in your owneDecret. part. 1. cap. 11. Ecclesiasti∣corum. Aug. ex Basi∣lio; Quae scripta no∣bis, quibus verbis sit Consecratio, com∣mendavit? Bookes of Augustine, out of Basil, saying that No writing hath delivered in what words the forme of Consecration was made. Now then, guesse you what was in the braines of your Dis∣puters, in objecting this Testimony of Basil, contrary to the evident Sense; and accordingly judge of the weaknesse of your Cause, which hath no better supports than such fond, false, and ridiculous Objections to relye upon. Such as is al∣so
that your Bellar. lib 2. de Euch. cap 8. §. Al∣trum. Cardinall his objecting the words of , concerning the receiving of this Sacrament, saying, Lord I am not worthy thou shouldest come under the roose of my mouth: which hath beene confuted, as unworthy theSee above B. 5. Chap 5. Sect. 6. mention in this case. If you would have some Examples of Adoring Christ with Divine worship, in the Mysterie of the Eucharist, by celebrating the maner of his death, (as Hierome may be said to have ado∣red at Ierusalem, Christ in his Cratch; or as every Christian doth in the Mysterie of Baptisme) wee could store you with multi∣tudes: but of Adoring the Eucharist, with a proper Invocation of Christ himselfe, wee have not as yet received from you any one. {fleur-de-lys} A Vindication of the Testimonies of Dionysius, Pachymeres, and Nazianzen, against the late vaine Calumni∣ations of a Romish Seducer. SECT. V. IN the former Section was objected the Testimonie of Dionysius, saying of the Eucharist [ô Divine Sacrament!] as if it had beene spoken to the Sacrament, by invocating of it; and implying therein a Divine Adoration, because of that Corporall presence of Christ under the Formers of Bread and Wine. The Insufficiencie of this Consequence was mani∣fested (besides divers other Instances) by the Testimonie of Pachymres your Greeke Expositour of Dionysius, referring us to Nazianzen his like words, when hee sayd [ô great and holy Pascha.] A late Romish Seducer (to omit his verball wranglings, which are now removed in this second Edition) falleth foule upon mee in an invective Conclusion, saying [So wee see that Bellarmine, Dionysius, Pachymeres, and Nazianzen all agree: and that onely my Lord of Durham hath dealt inju∣riously with them all.] So hee. Even so, as it became an egregious Seducer to say, as will now appeare. The par∣ties, which are said to be injured, are no lesse than fower; Bellarmine the Objector of Dionysius, Dionysius the Author objected, Pachymeres the Expositor of the same Dionysius, referring us to the like Saying in Nazianzen, and lastly Na∣zianzen himselfe; unto whose sentence wee were so refer∣red. Whose words are these [ô great and holy Pascha:] which words, sayd I, were spoken to the Feast of Easter, and not to the Eucharist, and consequently not to Christ as Corpo∣rally present therein. Nay (saith the Seducer) by [Pascha] was not meant the Feast of Easter, but the Eucharist, and
that by [ô great and holy Pascha] Nazianzen declareth his Invocation of Christ therein. So hee. As soone then as wee shall understand the words of Nazianzen aright, wee shall easily discerne the Exposition of Pachymeres, and by him the meaning of Dionysius, and consequently the meere Sophistry (as I called it) of your Cardinall Bellarmine. The words of Nazianzen, truly translated, are these; [But ô Pascha, the great and holy, the purification of the world, for I will speake unto thee as to that, which, as it were, hath Life.] The last words, [] will assoile the whole doubt, which are spoken onely by way of a Metaphoricall Similitude, thus; [As to that, which, as it were, hath Life:] thereby implying, that it is in it selfe without Life, as both your Bil∣lius the Translator of Nazianzen, and Nicetas his Commen∣tator and Expositor; and lastly, Nazianzen himselfe will manifest. I. Billius (being hee whom the Romish Sedu∣cer himselfe hath attested, and whom wee now assume for our Proctor) translateth Nazianzen's words thus; [Billius in Orat. 42. Nazianz. To enim quasi vitâ praeditum alloquar. For I will speake unto thee, even as having Life: or, to that, which, as it were, hath Life:] Wee demand then, would any but an Anti-Christian say of Christ, that he is but a [Quasi] one who, as it were, hath Life? Secondly Nicetas, Metropolitane of Heraclea, is a professed and privileged Expositor of Nazianzen, him wee desire to be our Advocate in this Cause. [Nicetas in lo∣cum ipsum Nazianz. [O Pascha magnum & sacrum Pascha, &c.] Haec verba Na∣zianzeni ad Festum ipsum perinde ac vitâ praeditum refert. These words of Nazianzen [ô great Pascha, I say, ô sacred Pascha] Nazianzen (saith hee) referreth unto the Feast it selfe, as if it were indued with Life.] So hee. Do you not see how the words [] that is [As it were having Life] compelled this learned Bi∣shop to expound the words of Nazianzen as meant properly of [The Feast it selfe] called in Greeke and Latine Pascha, and by us Pace or Easter, and not to the Eucharist? which was that my Conclusion, against which the Romish Seducer hath revelled, and thereupon in a maner reviled me, to make me a Falsificator like himselfe. Lastly Nazianzen is hee, whom wee reserve for our Pa∣tron in this Cause. The subject matter of the whole Oration of Nazianzen, now mentioned, is (as all know that have read it) the Celebration of the Great and holy Feast of Easter, of the which Feast, some few lines after his entrance into his Oration, hee hath these words; [Pascha of the Lord, Pascha, and (in honour of the Trinity) I say the third time Pascha. This is the Feast of Feasts, and Celebrity of Celebrities;] expresly speaking not of Christ the Lord, nor of the Eucharist, but of that which hee calleth The Feast of Feasts: namely, that, which hee as expresly named The Pascha of the Lord: which words in the beginning of Nazianzen's Oration most harmo∣niously
accord unto his words now controverted in the end of the same Oration with Ecchoing as it were to the Former saith [ô great and holy Pascha] namely, in respect of the same Pascha, the Feast of Feasts, and Celebritie of Celebrities. But this Romish Seducer, never considering these Premi∣ses, peremptorily posteth on, objecting onely the words of Nazianzen immediately following, which unto a Cursory Reader, might seeme to make, for him, some shew of Con∣futation; for thus hee proceeds: [ô word of God, and Light, and Life, and Wisedome, and Power, for I am delighted with all thy names, &c.] Which words we confesse are spoken of Christ, and not of the Feast, whereupon your Seducer concludeth, that the former words [ô Pascha] refer likewise to Christ. Which his Erroneous conceipt hath beene long since confuted by the forenamed Bishop Nicetas, expresly affirming of these words that They were spoken of theSee above a [12] Feast, and these last words [ô Word of God and Light, &c.] are spoken indeed to Christ the spirituall Pascha. But how? by Invocation? no: but by Ac∣clamation (saith hee) nothing being more Familiar to Ora∣tors, than to use Apostrophe's, by Transition from the Signe to the Thing signified: as here, from the Signe, which was Christ's day of Resurrection, to the Contemplation of the person risen againe. Notwithstanding, were it that this had beene an Invoca∣tion of Christ, yet except it had beene an Invocation of him, as hee was then in the Eucharist, it maketh nothing at all for Bellarmines Conclusion, which was thus, Ergò Christ is cor∣porally is this Sacrament, and to be Divinely adored therin. By all which you may clearly discern the true meaning of the first objected Author Dionysius from his Expositor Pa∣chymeres. II. The Iudgement of Pachymeres, by his Re∣ference to the Sentence of Gregory Nazianzen. III. The exact Vnderstanding of Gregory Nazianzen, by the Com∣mentarie of the Bishop Nicetas. And IV. the truth of that Commentarie by the Tenor of Nazianzen's Oration it selfe, as you have heard; and consequently that there is still just Cause for us to exclaime both against the So∣phistry of your Bellarmine, and rashnesse and impotencie, if not impudencie ra∣ther, of this frivolous Seducer and Calumniator.{fleur-de-lys}
CHAP. IV. That the Divine Adoration of the Sacrament is thrice Re∣pugnant to the Iudgement of Antiquity. First by their Silence. SECT. I. YOu are not to require of us, that wee produce the expresse Sentences of ancient Fathers, con∣demning the Ascribing of Divine honour to the Sacrament, seeing that this Romish Doctrine was neither in Opinion nor Practice in their times. It ought to satisfie you, that your owne most zealous, indefatigable, subtile, and skilfull Miners, dig∣ging and searching into all the Volumes of Antiquity, which have beene extant in the Christian world for the space of sixe or seven hundred yeares after Christ, yet have not beene able to extract from them any proofe of a Divine honour, as due to this Sacrament, either in expresse words, or practice; insomuch that you are enforced to obtrude onely such Sentences, and Acts, which equally extend to the honouring of the Sacra∣ment of Baptisme, and other sacred things, whereunto (even according to your owne Romish Profession) Divine honour can∣not be attributed without grosse Idolatry: and neverthelesse have your Disputers not spared to call such their Objections Cleare Arguments, piercing, and unsoluble. Wee therfore make bold hereupon to knocke at the Consi∣story doore of the Conscience of every man, indued with any small glimpse of Reason, and to entreat him, for Christs sake, whose Cause it is, to judge betweene Rome and Vs, after hee hath heard the case, which standeth thus; Divine Adoration of the Host is held to be, in the Romish Profession, the principall practicke part of Christian Religion. Next, the ancient Fathers of the Church were the faithfull Registers of Catholike Truth, in all necessary points of Chri∣stian Faith, and Divine worship. They in their Writings ma∣nifoldly instructed their Readers by Exhortations, Admoniti∣ons, Perswasions, and Precepts how they are to demeane themselves in the receiving of this Sacrament; not omitting any Act, whereby to set forth the true Dignity, and Reverence belonging unto it; many of the same Holy Fathers sealing that their Christian profession with their Blood. It is now referred
to the Iudgement of every man, whether it can fall within his capacity to thinke it Credible, that those Fathers, if they had beene of the now Romish Faith, would not have expresly de∣livered, concerning the due Worship of this Sacrament, this one word consisting but of two syllables [viz. Divine] for directi∣on to all Posterity, to adore the Sacrament with Divine honour, even as it is taught in the Church of Rome at this day: and to have confirmed the same by some Practice, not of one or other private man or woman, but by their publike forme of Prayer, and Invocation in their solemne Masses; or else to confesse, that Antiquity never fancied any Divine Adoration of the Eucharist. Yet two words more. You presse the point of the Invoca∣tion of the Sacrament more urgently and vehemently than any other: and wee indeed believe that the ancient Fathers (if they had held, according to the now Romane Church, a Corporall presence of Christ) would never have celebrated any Masse, without an expresse Invocation of the Sacrament, as in your now-Romane Masse, wee finde it done, saying, O Lambe of God, &c. or some other like forme. Yet know (now) that your owne learned Pamelius hath published two large Tomes of all the Masses in the Latine Church, from Pope Clemens downe to Pope Gregory (containing the compasse of six hundred yeares) wee say, Latine Missals above forty in number; in all which, upon our once reading, wee presume to say that there is not one such tenour of Invocation at all. This our first Reason, ta∣ken from so universall a silence of ancient Fathers, in a case of so necessary a moment, may be (wee thinke) satisfactory in it selfe to any man of ordinary Reason. Our second Objection out of the Fathers followeth. That the Ancient Fathers gain-sayd the Corporall presence of Christ in this Sacrament, and the Adoration therof, by their Preface, in their presenting the Host, saying, [Lift up your Hearts.] SECT. II. IT was the generall Preface of Antiquity, used in the Cele∣bration of this Sacrament, for the Minister to say, [Lift up your Hearts,] and the People to answer, [Wee lift them up unto the Lord.] This [Sursum Corda] CalvinCalvin. Instit. lib. 2. c. 17. §. 36.

This, one would thinke, is plaine enough, but that is much more, which wee have already proved out of the Fathers, by their Antithesis, and Opposition betweene the Altar on Earth, and the other in Heaven; where wee have heardSee above, Booke 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 8. &c. Chrysostome di∣stinguishing them that fasten their thoughts upon this Below, from Them that seeke Christ in Heaven, as hee doth Choughs from Eagles.

All, as plaine as plainnesse it selfe. {fleur-de-lys} Will you suffer one, whom the world knoweth to have been as excellently versed in Antiquity as any other, to determine this Point? Hee will come home unto you;Tempore ve∣ters Ecclesiae Ro∣manae populus non cursitabat ad viden∣dum id quod Sacer∣dos ostendit, sed pro∣stratis humi corpori∣bus, animis in coelum erectis, gratias age∣bant Redemptori. E∣ras. lib. de amab. Ec∣cles. Concord. In the time of the ancient Church of Rome (saith hee) the people did not run hi∣ther and thither to behold that which the Priest doth shew, but prostrating their Bodies on the ground, they lift up their minds to heaven, giving thanks to their Redeemer. So hee. Thus may wee justly appeale, as in all other Causes of moment, so in this, from this degenerate Church of Rome, to the sincere Church of Rome, in the Primitive times; like as one is repor∣ted to have Appealed from Caesar sleeping to Caesar waking. Our difference then can be no other than was that betweene Mary and Stephen, noted by Ambrose,Ambros. in Luc. cap. 24. Maria, quae quaerebat Christum in terra, angere non potuit: Stephanus te∣tigit, qui quaesivit in coelo. Mary, because shee sought to touch Christ on earth, could not; but Stephen touched him, who sought him in heaven. A third Argument followeth. That the ancient Fathers cendemned the Romish worship by their Descriptions of Divine Adoration. SECT. III. ALl Divine Adoration of a meere Creature is Idolatry; hereunto accord these sayings ofAug Tom. 2 Epist. 44. ad Maxim. Christianis Catholi∣cis nihil ut numen a∣doratur, quod con∣ditum est a Deo. Idē Tom. 8. in Psalm. 98. Timeo terram ado∣rare, ne me damnet qui fecit coelum & terram. Nazianz. O∣rat 31. . Antiquity: No Ca∣tholike Christian doth worship, as a Divine Power, that which is created of God. Or thus, I feare to worship earth, lest hee con∣demne mee, who created both Heaven and earth. Or thus, If I should worship a Creature, I could not be named a Christian. It were a tedious superfluity, in a matter so universally confessed by your selves, and all Christians, to use Witnesses unnecessa∣rily. Wee adde the Assumption. But the Romish Adoration of the Sacrament is an attributing of Divine Honour to a meere Creature, the Consecrated Bread. For that it is still Bread, you shall find to have beene the Doctrine of Primitive Fathers, if you shall but have the patience to stay untill wee deliver unto
you aSee Booke 8. Chap. 1. Sect. 3. Synopsis of their Catholike Iudgement herein; after that wee have duly examined your Romish Doctrine by your owne Principles, which is the next point. CHAP. V. An Examination of the Romish Adoration of the Sacra∣ment in the Masse, to prove it Idolatrous, by dis∣cussing your owne Principles. The State of the Question. IDolatry, by the Distinction of your Iesuites, is ei∣ther Materiall, or Formall. The Materiall you call that, when the Worshipper adoreth something in stead of God, in a wrong perswasion that it is God; otherwise you judge the Worship to be a Formall Idolatry. Now because many of your seduced Roma∣nists are perswaded that your Romish worship, in your Masse, cannot be subject either to Materiall or Formall Idolatry, it con∣cerneth us in Conscience, both for the honour of God, and safety of all that feare God, to prove Both. Wee begin at that which you confesse to be a Materiall Idolatry. That the Romish Adoration of the Host, in the hand of the Priest, is necessarily a Materiall Idolatry, by reason of many hundred confessed Defects: whereof Seven concerne the Matter of the Sacrament. SECT. I. IT is a point unquestionable among you, that if the thing, in the hand of the Priest, be not duly Consecrated, then the Mat∣ter Adored is but a meere Creature; and your Adoration must needs be, at the least, a Materiall Idolatry. The Seven defects, set downe in your RomaneMissal. Rom. pag. 31. Vbi debita materia deficit, non conficitur Sacramen∣tum.—Si non sit panis triticeus, vel si alioqui corruptus. Et pag. 32. Si Vinum sit factum acetum, vel penitùs putidum, vel de uvis acerbis & non maturis expressum, vel admixtum aquae, ut sit corruptum, non conficitur Sacramentum.

Disp. 67 Sect. 4. § Dico. Et Durand. Si plus apponatur Aquae quàm Vini, erit irritum Sacramentum. Lib. 4. cap. 42. Iesuite, are these; First, If the Bread be not of Wheat; or secondly, Be corrupt; or thirdly, the Wine be turned Vinegar; or fourthly, of sowre; or fifthly, unripe Grapes; or sixthly, be stinking, or im∣perfectly mixt with any liquor of any other kinde, the Consecration
is void: so that neither Body or Blood of Christ can be there pre∣sent; seventhly, yea, and if there be more Water than Wine. So you. All which Defects how easily they may happen, beyond the understanding of every Consecrating Priest, let Bakers and Vintners judge. That there are Sixe otherMissal. Ro∣man in Can. Misse. Sex modis continge∣re potest formae va∣riatio (nunrùm) per Additionem, de∣tractionem, alicujus vocis mutationem, vel si una pontur lo∣co alterius, corrupti∣onem vocis alicujus, detrahendo, vel mu∣tando syllabam ali∣quam, transpositio∣nē, id est, ordinis di∣ctionum variatione, ac deinde per inter∣ruptionem, ut pro∣nunciando unā par∣tem formae, ac quic∣scendo per aliquod spacium, vel loquen∣do aliquid imperti∣nens.

Animadvert.—[Hoc est, &c.] Si quis diminueret ali∣quid, aut immutaret de forma Cōsecratio∣nis, vel aliquid addat, quod significationem mutaret, non consiceret Sacramentum. Missal. Rom. pag. 33. Haec sunt necessaria necessitate Sacramenti, quibus sublatis, tollitur Sacramentum, ut nimirum non peccet Sacerdos corrumpendo verba Consecrationis. Item Alan. de Sacram. in Gen. cap. 21. confessed Defects, incident to either Element in the Eucharist, which may hinder the Consecra∣tion; and necessarily inferre an Idolatrous Ado∣ration, in respect of the Forme of Consecrating. SECT. II. AS thus; If the Priest faile in Pronunciation of these words, [Hoc est corpus meum:] or in these, Hic est calix sanguinis mei: novi, & aeterni Testamenti: mysterium fide qui pro vobis, & pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum. Which your Romane Missall and Doctors say may happen, in either of both, sixe maner of wayes: first, by Addition; or secondly, by Omission; thirdly, by Mutation and Change of any one Syllable, which may alter the sense of the speech; fourthly, by Interruption of voice, and by too long pausing in uttering of the words; fifthly, by Corruption of any word; sixthly, by some Interposition of words betweene, which are impertinent. Each one of these faults, (say you) concerning either Element, doth so disannull the Consecration, that The thing adored is still but Bread and Wine, and therefore the worship thereof must be a Materiall Idolatry. So you. And how easie it is for the Priest (that wee may use your owne Examples) to say, Hoc est Cor meum; or, Hoc est Cor-pus; or, Meum corpus est; or, Hic erit Calix; or, as the Tale goeth of a Priest, who (having many Hosts before him to be consecra∣ted, lest hee might erre in his Grammar, in using the singular number for the plurall) Consecrated in these words,Agrippa. Sicut narratur de Sacrificulo, sivè verum, sivè fabula sit, qui cùm plures haberet Hostias, ne Grammaticam omitteret, in haec verba consecravit, Haec sunt corpora mea. De vanit. Scient. cap. 3. Haec sunt corpora mea; These are my Bodies: wee say for the possibility of these and the like Lapses (beside this last from the want of wit) the manifold infirmities of mans speech, either upon Amazement, or Temulencie, or Temerity and Negligence, or Imperfection of a Stammering tongue, can give you a shrewd guesse.
That there are Foure other confessed kinde of Defects, in respect of the Priests Intention, whereby the Consecration being hindred, the Romish Adoration must needs be materially Idolatrous. SECT. III. AS for Example, first,Bellarm. Si Sacerdos fingit se consecrare, cum non consecrat, Christus abest.—Nisi intentio Ministri fit altem virtualis, a∣nimo faciendi quod facit Ecclesia, non est Consecratio. De Sa∣cram. in Gen. cap. 27. Si quis non intendit conficere, nisi delu∣soriè aliquid agere. Missal. Rom. Pag. 33.—Vel ex obli∣vione, cùm hostia a∣liqua lateat, cùm non intendit consecrare nisi quas videt. Vel si habens coram se vndecim hostias, & intendat consecrare decem, non determinans quas decem intendit, non consecrat, quia requiritur Intentio. Missal. Ibid. If the Priest in Consecrating (saith your Cardinall) have no intention to consecrate at all; or (to speake from your Romish Missal it selfe) secondly, If his virtuall Intention in Consecrating be not to do as the Church doth; or thirdly, If hee should consecrate but in mockery; or fourthly, Hee having more Hosts before him than hee is aware of; if hee in∣tend to consecrate fewer than there are before him; and yet not know∣ing which of them all to omit. Of the Easinesse of all these Defects, the possibility of retchlesnesse, of infidelity, of moc∣kery, and of obliviousnesse in some Priests may sufficiently prognosticate; each of which inferreth a confessed Materiall Idolatry. That there are Sixe other Defects able to frustrate the Consecra∣tion, by reason of the person of the Priest himselfe, as being Incompetent for want of due Baptisme. SECT. IV. FOr first you have aDecret. li. 13. tit. 43. cap. 3. Vehiens ad gradum Sacerdotij comperit tandē quod non sit baptizatus, ri∣tè fecimus ipsum baptizari. Case of one being a Priest, who had not beene baptized; and next concerning Defects of Bap∣tisme, you resolve (as before of pronunciation of the forme of the Eucharist)Bellarm. Vel una litera. De Sa∣cram. in Gen. cap. 25. §. Secunda Prop.—Haec sunt necessaria necessitate Sacra∣menti, ut nimirùm non peccet Sacerdos corrumpendo verba Consecrationis: ut in Baptismo si quis dicat, Baptizo te in nomine Matris, &c. Alan. Card de Sacrā. in Gen. cap. 21. And Azorius, See above, Sect. 2. lit. (c) that if in pronunciation of the wordes of Baptisme [Baptizo te in nomine Patris, Filij, & Spiritus Sancti] the Minister (whether man, or woman) shall vary one word, which may corrupt the true sense of the words, although but in one Syllable, or Letter, be it either by adding, removing, changing, or by any of the sixe Defects, (already spoken of) as in saying, Ego te baptizo in nomine Patriae, &c. or the like, then the whole Consecration is of no effect. The possibility of womens erring in their ministery of Baptisme, Cardinal Pole may seeme to teach in that his Article, whereby it is inquired, M. Fox his Acts and Monum. pag. 1969. Whether Parsons, Vicars, and Curates be diligent in teaching women to baptize Children after the maner of the Church.
Take with you another Case, supposed by your selves, the Cosmus Philiarch. de offic. Sacerd. Tom. 1. lib. 1. cap. 14. Potest dari casus, sicut audivi datum esse, quòd filius alicujus nobilis sit à leva∣trice baptizatus aquà osaccâ, quia est filius nobilis, &c. Author delivereth it at length, the briefe is this: The woman bap∣tizeth an Infant, because it is the Child of a noble man, in Rosewater, the Baptisme is voyd; the Childe is afterwards ordained a Bishop, & he is after that sent by the Pope into divers parts of the world, and by him innumerable Priests are ordained; after the death of the Bishop, the case is made knowne, but who they were that had beene ordained cannot possibly be knowne, whose Ordi∣nations are all invalid, and their Ministery and Consecrations of no effect. What remedy now in this Case? None (saith the Author) at all, except there be a Privilege in the Pope to consti∣tute all them Priests, who had beene so irregularly ordained, onely by his word, Dicendo, sint Saderdotes, saying, Be they all Priests. So hee, who notwithstanding had rather thinke the Case could not possibly happen, than to trust to this Remedy. How-ever it might be in this one, the possibility of the other Six Defects neither man nor woman can deny, every one con∣cluding a Materiall Idolatry. That there are manifold confessed possible Defects; disabling the person of the Priest to Consecrate, in respect of his undue Ordination; whereby is occasioned a Materiall Idolatry. SECT. V. YOu have furthermoreSee (as before) so also in the next Sect. at the letter (a). confessed, that, for want of due Ordination of the Priest, the Sacrament remaineth in his former nature onely of Bread, and Wine; as if hee be an In∣truder, and not ordained at all: or else of the forme of Ordi∣nation, viz. [Accipe potestatem offerendi Sacrificium: Et Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, quorum peccataremiseris, remissa, &c.] As if it hath beene corrupted, by missing so much as one Syllable, or Letter, by Addition, Detraction, or any of the Sixe Errors be∣fore rehearsed; as Accipe Spiritu Sancto, for Spiritum Sanctum; or, Accipe potestatem ferendi Sacrificium, for Offerendi, or the like; {fleur-de-lys} to theBellarm. lib. 4. de Euchar. cap. 16. §. At—Semper in Ecclesia pro indubi∣tato habitum est, ità necessariam esse ordinationem Sacerdotalem, ad Eucharistiam conficiendam, ut sinè eo confici nullo modo possit. Et lib. 1. de Sacrom. in Gen. cap. 21. Verba Sacramentorum determinata sunt, ut non liceat quicquid immutare, &c. Altering of the Sense of the Speech. {fleur-de-lys}
That there are many hundred confessed Defects, which may nullifie the Consecration, to make the Romish Adoration Idolatrous, in respect of Insufficiencies, which might be incident unto the Prae-ordainers of that Priest, whoso∣ever hee be, that now Consecrateth; for causing a Materiall Idolatry. SECT. VI. IF theSi deficit or∣do Sacerdotalis in consiciente, non con∣ficitur Sacramentum. Missal. Roman. pag. 31.

Thinking belike that if wee should in this number of yeares allow unto every Bishop ordaining the continuance of twenty yeares Bishop upward to Saint Peter, the number of them all would amount to fourscore Bishops; among whom if any one were an Intruder, or Vnor∣dained, then this Priest faileth in his Priest-hood. Now of these kindes yourPlena sunt illa tempora Ordina∣tionibus Paparum, Exordinationibus, Superordinationibus. Baron. Ann. 908. num. 3. & Ann. 897. num. 6, & 8. & Ann. 900. num. 6.

Priests, Whose Ordinations were all voyd, albeit they had exercised their functions of Consecrating, in the Masse, for ten or twelve yeares space. {fleur-de-lys} Yet is not this all, for unto these are to be added the other Defects, to wit, want of Baptisme, whether for want of due Intention, being three; or undue Pronunciation, being six; or the Errors either of Intention, or Pronunciation in Ordination, all which make eighteene: and these being multiplied by foure∣score (which is the number of Bishop-ordainers from this Bishop to Saint Peter) the totall, wee suppose, will at the least amount unto a Thousand possible Defects, each one whereof, if it hap∣pen, doth quite frustrate and annull the Consecration of this Priest, whosoever hee be, that now saith Masse; and leaveth to the people nothing but the Substance of the Creatures of Bread and Wine to be Adored, in stead of Christ Iesus, the Sonne of God. And yet in this Summe are not reckoned the foresaid Defects concerning the Matter, or Forme of Consecration, or of
the Priests Intention therein, or else of his possible Intrusion into this Function of Consecrating of this one Priest, now supposed to bee ordained; every Defect being of force in it selfe to inferre necessarily a Materiall Idolatry in your Romish Masse. Now rather than you shall call these our Instances odious, or malicious, you must accuse your owne Romish Church, be∣cause wee have alleged no Testimony, but out of your owne publke Romish Missall, Cardinalls, Iesuits, and other Au∣thors privileged in your Church. Wee are now in the high point of Christian Religion, even the principall part of Gods Royalty, Divine Adoration, not to be trisled withall. There∣fore now, if ever, shew your selves conscionable Divines, by freeing your Romish Masse from a Formall Idolatry in these forenamed Respects, concerning your confessed Materiall Idola∣try; and do it by some grounds of Truth, or else abandon your Profession, as most damnably Idolatrous.

Although (say they, in the Margin) there be no true Consecration, by reason of divers Defects, yet in him who upon a Morall certainty, with a sincere mind and good intention, doth adore Bread, it is but Materiall, and no Formall Idolatry, so that hee have an Habituall condition, as being so disposed in his mind, not to give a Divine honour unto it, if hee knew it to be but Bread. As for Example; Hee that giveth an Almes to a Rich man, being probably perswaded that hee is not rich, the Act proceedeth from a pious Intention. And, As it was no Sin in Iacob to lye with Leah, because hee thought her to be his wife;
so in this case it is no formall Idolatry to worship Bread, being Mo∣rally perswaded that it is Christ. Thus they. Your Pretences herein are three; Morall Certainty, Good Intent, and (at least) Habituall Condition. But alas! all this is but Sowing Fig-leaves together, which will never be able to cover your foule shame of grosse Idolatry. To begin first with that which you call Morall Certainty. That the Pretence of Morall Certainty of worshipping of Bread, instead of Christ, cannot free the Romish Church from Formall Idolatry. SECT. II. OVr Confutation is grounded upon divers impregnable Reasons, one whereof is taken from the Iealousie of God in his worship; the second from the Faith required in a true worshipper; the third from the nature of an Oath; and the last from the Vncertainty of that, which you call Morall Cer∣tainty. First then, although Morall and Conjecturall perswasions might excuse mens Actions in divers Cases, yet in an Object of Divine Worship it is utterly condemnable, even because of the Iealousie of the Almighty, who expresseth himselfe to be a Iealous God, Exod. 20. signifying, as[Ego sum Deus tuus fortis zelôtes, Exod. 20. 5.] Dicitur Deus Zelôtes, id est, zelum tenens: zelus autem est amor priva∣tus, nolens habere consortium in amato. Et sic viri dicuntur habere zelum de uxoribus suis, quia volunt quòd uxores suae solos illos ament, & solis illis copulentur. Sic etiam Deus volebat quòd Idaei eam solum colerent, & eum ut Deum cognoscerent: & quando alius colere∣tur ut Deus, dolebat, tanquam si vir videat uxorem suam amantem alium virum. Et sicut cùm mulier alteri quàm viro suo copulatur, fornicari dicitur: ita qui alterum quàm verum Deum colebat, fornicari dicebatur in Scriptura cum Dijs alienis. Abulens. in Exod. 20. pag. 273 col. 2. you know, that Hee will not indure any consort in his worship; his Motto being this, I am, and there is no Other. Even as in the Case of mortall Ma∣jesty, when as a subject, building upon a Morall Certainty one∣ly,
shall question the Title and Right of his Soveraigne establi∣shed in his Throne, hee becometh guilty of High Treason. Secondly, all Divine Worship must be performed with a Di∣vine Faith, which is an Infallible perswasion of the God-head of that which wee honour as God, as it is written: Hee that com∣eth to God, must believe that God is, Heb. 11. 6. and againe, You must aske in Faith, nothing doubting, Iac. 1. because this is the nature of Faith, as the Apostle describeth it; Faith is the Hy∣postasis of things not seene. Heb. 11. That is, (to take yourGraeci optimè interpretantur Hypo∣stasin per substanti∣am, quia fides essicit ut ea, quae credit, non minùs certa habea∣mus, quàm si subsiste∣rent. Ribera Ies. Com. in Heb. 11. pag. 514. owne Comment) Faith aketh those things, which are believed, no lesse certaine than if they did subsist: whereby wee are taught both the nature and necessitie of Faith in Divine Worship. But Morall and Conjecturall Certainty is not an Hypostasis, which im∣plieth an Infallibilitie of Truth, but an Hypothesis, and supposi∣tion of that which may be otherwise, and hath in it nothing but Vncertainty at all; of which moreChap. 9. Sect. 4. hereafter. Thirdly, God himselfe commandeth his People by his Pro∣phet, saying, Thou shalt worship mee, and (inSeptuagiots. Greeke, ) shalt sweare by my Name. Swearing then is an Adoration, by Invocating of God; and his owne peculiar Prerogative. Hear∣ken now. By this Law of God, none may sweare by any thing as God, which hee dare not sweare is God: But your Romish Professors, in your Masse, Invocate this Sacrament thus,Sacerdos incli∣natus Sacramento, junctis manibus, & ter pectus percutiens, dicit, Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis. Et rursus, Agnus Dei, &c. Missal. Rom. pag. 24. Rursus. Inclinato ca∣pite versus Sacramen∣tum, dicit intelligibili voce, Da nobis pa∣cem: Et rursus se∣cretè, Domine Iesu Christe, &c. Missal. Rom. ibid O Lambe of God, which takest away the Sins of the world, have mercie upon us. And what Romish Professor is there who sweareth not By the Masse (meaning the Consecrated Host) as by Christ himselfe? Notwithstanding, no one of your Romish Priests (by reason of the manifold Defects incident thereunto, as you have heard) durst ever sweare that this, which is now Consecra∣ted by him on the Altar, is not substantially Bread, or that it is the Body of Christ. It must therefore follow, that your Adora∣tion having no better Certainty, than (as you have confessed) to adore it with an [If it be Christ,] is a faithlesse prophanation of the name of the Son of God, and of his Worship. This Point, concerning Faith in every Worshipper, will be confes∣sed Thorow-out the 7. Chapter. afterwards. In the last place (that wee may ruinate the very foundation of your Excuse) your Pretence of Morall Certainty cometh to be examined, which you have exemplified by one giving an Almes to a poore man, who peradventure hath no need: and of Iacobs lying ignorantly with her that was not his wife. These, say wee, are Cases farre different from this which wee have in hand, because Gods Almoner (you know) is not bound to enquire of a man, whom hee seeth to appeare to be miserable and poore, whether hee be a Counterfeit or no; for Charity is not suspicious, saith the Apostle Saint Paul. Iacob, indeed, was bound to know onely his owne wife, but if hee had had any probable
or Morall Cause of doubt, would that holy Patriarke (thinke you) have beene so deluded, or over-reached a second, and a third time, to defile his body by an unchaste Bed? But the Causes of your Doubtings are see forth and numbred by threes, Sixes, Twenties, Hundreds, untill you come to a Thousand, and (as your Iesuite hath said) Almost infinite Defects. For in∣deed if there be (as appeareth) a Thousand hazards in every Masse of any one Priest, then in two Priests, as many more, and so forward; so that if one should heare in his time the Masses of Ten, and Twenty Priests, what multitudes of Thousands of Defects would the reckoning make? But wee need say no more, than hath already been confessed of Almost infinite, and (con∣sequently) as many Doubts of an Idolatrous worship; wherein there cannot be so much Morall Certainty, as that, in any one ge∣neration of men from Christ's time, each one of that off-spring hath beene chastly borne, whereunto what Christian is there that dare be sworne? CHALLENGE. COnsider (wee beseech you, for Gods Cause, for wee are now in the Cause of God) whether our God, who will be knowne to be transcendently Iealous of his owne Honour, would ever ordaine such a worship of a Sacrament, whereby men must needs be still more obnoxious to that, which you call a Materiall Idolatry, by many hundred-fold, than possibly any can be to any materiall Parricide, or materiall Murther, or materiall Adulte∣ry, or any other hainous and materiall Transgression, that can be named under the Sun. Thus much of your first Pretence, for this present, untill wee come to receive theSee Chap. 7. thorowout. Confessions of your owne Doctors in this very point. That the Second Romish Pretence, which is of a Good Intent, cannot free your Adoration of the Host from Formall Idolatry. SECT. III. LEt us heare your Cardinall;Bellar. Sicut is, qui panem non consecratum injuriâ afficeret, &c. See a∣bove, Sect. 1. (a). Honour (saith hee) depen∣deth upon the Intention, so that as hee, who should contemp∣tuously abuse the unconsecrated Bread, thinking it to be Consecrated, should grievously offend Christ; contrariwise hee, who certainly beleeving the Bread to be Christs Body, shall Adore the same, doth principally and formally Adore Christ, and not the Bread. So hee, even with the same Sophistry, from onely such a seeming Con∣trariety, wherewith you use to pleade for Merits: (to wit) if evill workes deserve damnation, then good workes deserve
eternall life. But will you be pleased to heare the same Cardi∣nall speake in earnest, from the Principles of true Logike? Mla inten∣tio vittat opus: sed perperā inde colligi∣tur opera mala ex in∣tentione bona justi∣ficari. Nam opus bo∣num nascitur ex in∣tegra causâ, malum autem ex quovis de∣fectu oriti potest. Bellar. de amiss. Grat. lib. 2. cap. 4. §. P∣mum enim. Although an evill Intention doth  and corruptiun Act otherwise good, yet it followeth not that a good Intent should justisie an evill Act, because no Act is good, except all the Causes thereof be good; but any Act is evill upon any one Defect. So hee; which his Conclusion is held as universally true in all Schooles, whe∣ther Christian, or Heathen, as any point of Morality can be. Wherefore it followeth not, that because a man doth some∣thing to the contempt of Christ, in abusing that which hee thinketh to be Christ, that therefore the honour, which hee doth to that, which hee falsly believeth to be Christ, should be an Adoration of Christ: as all Heathenish Idolatry, in wor∣shipping stocks and stones, in an opinion of adoring the true God, do witnesse to the world, as your owneChap. 7, and 8. Confessions will confirme. {fleur-de-lys} It may not seeme a thing superfluous to apply to our former Answer the Testimony of your Iesuite Lessius, judg∣ing itIncredibile videtur, Deum tanti aestimare amorem, quo eum amo, quanti peccatum, quo eum offendo: quis enim eum, qui Principi fa∣cit injuriam, vel ejus legem violavit, ità ut mereatur mortem, dicat satisfacere ex aequo, si illum amet, & doleat de suo fa∣cto, & promittat e∣mendationem? quis dicat ex natura rei tanti debere aestimare dolorem illum ex a∣more profectū, quanti injuriam, & legis vi∣olationem? nec ju∣re posse Principem injuriam retinere, & pro meritis punire? hoc ipso enim quod quis meritus est amittere vicam & bona sua om∣nia, etiamsi millies amet, millies doleat, & emendationem promittat, censebitur ullo modo aequivalens of∣ferre, quod mereatur condonationem; multò minùs possit homo compensationem Deo reddere. Lessius Ies. Opusc. lib. 13. de Iustic. cap. 27. A thing incredible, for God to equall mans love unto him (in the good) as hee would do Sin, wherewith hee is offen∣ded: for who will say (saith hee) that a man injuring his Prince, and violating his Lawes so, as to deserve death, shall e∣qually satisfie it, after hee shall be sorry for his offence, and love him, and promise amendment? will any affirme, if the nature of the thing bee duly considered, that the Prince is bound to be aswell pleased with the griefe of that man, for his offence, proceeding from love, as hee was offended at the inju∣rie, and that hee ought not to punish him? nay, but the man hath deserved to lose both Land and Life, although hee be a thousand times sorry for his offence: much lesse possible is it for man to returne an equall Compensation unto God. So hee, which sheweth sufficiently that there is a Disproportion of Contraries, in their divers respects. {fleur-de-lys} CHALLENGE. DO you not perceive what a patched Cloake of Sophistry your Cardinall cast upon your Good Intent, in your Ado∣ration, to cover the filthinesse thereof, if it might be? and how by another Position hee rent the same in pieces, when hee had done? Againe, you stand thus farre, furthermore, condemna∣ble in your selves in this Point, whilest as you seeke to free your Adoration from Idolatry, by Pretence of a Good Intent; and
notwithstanding hold a Good Intention not to be sufficient there∣unto, except it be qualified and formed with an Habituall Con∣dition, which is your Third and last Pretence; as fond and false as either of the former, whereof hereafter. That the Third Romish Pretence of an Habituall Condition, in the Worshipper, excuseth him not from formall Idolatry; proved first by Scripture. SECT. IV. HAbituall Condition you have interpreted to stand thus; See above Sect. 1. at the letter (a) ad finem. If hee that chanceth to worship onely Bread be in that Act so disposed in himselfe, that hee would not worship the same Bread, as Christ, if hee knew it were but Bread, and not Christ; and by this you teach, that the Act (which you call a Materiall Idolatry) is made not onely excusable, but (yourIbid. owne words) honest and commendable also. So you. What execrable Doctrine is this that wee heare? which cannot be justifiable except you will justifie the Murtherers of the members of Christ; and of Christ himselfe? First, of the members of Christ, wee reade of one Saul, afterwards Paul, breathing out threatnings, and slanders against them, Act. 9. 1. and persecu∣ting the Church, 1. Cor. 15. & Galath. 1. and drawing both men and women to death, Act. 22. 4. And all this, not malici∣ously, but (as you heare himselfe say) Ignorantly, 1. Tim. 1. 13. and with a good Conscience, Act. 23. 1. and in zeale, Phil. 3. 6. A fairer expression of a Good Intent, in a wicked practice, can∣not be, than this was: and as much may be said for his Habituall Condition, namely, that if hee had then (as afterwards) knowne Christ to have beene the Lord of life, and those murthered Chri∣stians, to have beene his mysticall Members, hee would rather have exposed himselfe to Martyrdome, than to have martyred those Saints of God. This Consequence directly appeareth, first by his Answer, in his miraculous Conversion, saying,Acts 9. 5. Who are thou, Lord? next by his detestation of his Fact,1. Cor. 15 9. I am un∣worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church, &c. then by his Acknowledgement of Gods especiall mercie,2. Tim. 1. 13. But God had mercie on mee. Afterwards by his Labour for winning soules to the Faith: I have laboured more abundantly than they all. And lastly, in that hee was one of those Actors, of whom Christ himselfe foretold, saying,Ioh. 16. 2. They shall draw you before Iudgement seats, and when they shall persecute you, they will thinke that they do God good service. Which also plainly argueth, that their and his perswasion of so doing proceded from a Morall Certainty, Good Intent, and Habituall Condition. From these Members let us ascend to our Head, Christ the
Lord of Glory; what thinke you of the Iewes? of whom Saint Peter sayd, You have murthered the Prince of life. Act. 3. 15. But did they this Voluntarily, and knowingly, as understanding him to have beene the Redeemer of the world, and indeed the Prince of life? they did not, for the same Apostle testifyeth in their behalfe, saying, I know you did it ignorantly, as did also your Rulers. Act. 3. 17. If this be not sufficient, heare the voice of the person that was slaine, Christ himselfe, who did so farre acquit them, saying, They know not what they do. Luk. 23. 24. Ignorantly then, in a Conjecturall Certainty, but yet with Good Intent; of whom Saint Paul witnesseth in these words, I beare them witnesse, that they have the Zeale of God, but not according to knowledge. Rom. 10. But what for Habituall Condition? were they not bent in their owne minds (if they had under∣stood what Christ was) to have abhorred that so heinous a guilt of the death of the Sonne of God? questionlesse, for so saith the Apostle: If they had knowne, they would not have crucifyed the Lord of Glory. 1. Cor. 2. 8. Wee conclude, seeing these Iewes, notwithstanding their Morall Certainty, (being seduced by their Priests) or else their Good Intent of doing God good ser∣vice therein; or yet their Habituall Condition, not to have cru∣cified Christ, if they had truly knowne him, were neverthelesse by Saint Peter condemned, yea and of themselves, as Formall and verily Murtherers of Christ; then (ô you Romish worship∣pers of the Host) must it necessarily follow, that in your Mas∣ses you are equally all Formally Idolaters, notwithstanding any of the same three Pretences to the contrary. Wherefore, as Salomon speaketh of an Adulterous woman; Prov. 30. 20. Shee eateth, and wipeth her mouth, saying, I have done no wic∣kednesse; so may wee say of Idolatrous Worshippers, and their Proctors: for what else are these your three Romish Preten∣ces, but like such mouth-wipes? or as Anodyna, and stupifying Medicines, which take away the Sense of the diseased person, but do not cure the disease? So do you delude miserable peo∣ple with false Pretences, lest they, discerning the grosnesse and ouglinesse of your Idolatry, might abhorre that worship, and abandon your Romish worshippers. That the former Romish Pretences have no warrant from Antiquity. SECT. V. THe number of Ancient Fathers, whose workes are yet ex∣tant (who lived within Six or Seven hundred yeares after Christ) are recorded to have beene about 200. out of whose monuments of Christian learning your chiefest Disputers could never hitherto produce anyone that justified your Romish wor∣ship,
by so much as in distinguishing of Materiall and Formall Ido∣latry; nor yet by qualifying any Idolatry under pretence of either Morall Certainty, or Good Intent, or yet Habituall Condition; and therefore must wee judge that they never gave Assent to this your Sorcery. For wee may not be so injurious to the memory of so many, so famously learned, and Catholike Doctors of the Church of Christ, that they could not; or of persons so holy, and zealous of Gods honour, and of mens Salvation, that they would not satisfie mens Consciences, to free them out of thus many and miserable perplexities, wherewith your now Romish Profession of Adoration of the Host is soConfessed a∣bove, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. by your Iesuit Suarez. Almost in∣finitely intangled. CHAP. VII. That the Romish Adoration, notwithstanding your former Pretences, is Formally Idolatrous; proved by foure Grounds of Romish Profession. The first is your Definition of Idolatry. SECT. I. DIvine honour (saith your IesuiteHonor est testimonium excel∣lentiae, quod conti∣netur verbo vel facto, quae de excellentia a∣licujus convenientem existimationem illi gignit. Sic honor di∣vinus est quicquid verborum aut offici∣orum omninò accō∣modatum est ad gig∣nendam existimati∣onem hujusmodi, quae in divinam ma∣jestatem propriè con∣veniat. Hoc duplici modo, I. ut opus sit naturâ suâ ità praeclarum, ut quis illud naturali lumine rationis solum Deum tali honore dignum esse judicet, quale est Sacrificium. Alterum, ut tale sit intentione ejus, qui vult de persona, quam honorat, talem existima∣tionem excitare, quae in divinam majestatem conveniat, licet honor iste alioqui indifferens sit. Gregor. Valent. lib. 2. de Idol. cap. 3. Valentia) is a Te∣stimony of excellencie, whether in word or outward office, that a man doth performe, whereby hee doth intend to beget in others such an estimation of God, unto that which hee honoureth, as is proper un∣to the Majestie of God. So that Idolatry is an Error in the under∣standing (saith your IesuiteEst Idololatria divini cultus erga falsum Deum exhibitio: colere enim pro Deo eum, qui non est Deus, aut ipsum laudando, aut ei aliquo modo prosternendo, Idololattare est.—Idolo∣latria (quae est falsa Adoratio) non est nisi error in intellectu, quo dignum honore judicamus Deum falsum, cui Idololatra se prosternit. Tolet. Ies. Instit. Sacerd. lib. 4. cap. 24. §. Est igitur. Tolet) in yielding divine worship to that which is not God, whether by praising, invocating, sacrificing, or prostrating our selves to that which is not God. In a word, Ido∣latry comprehendeth all religious superstition (saith your Iesuite Idololatria comprehen∣dit omnem superstiosam religionem, quâ quaelibet res colitur pro Deo. Lorinus Ies. in Acts 17. 16. Lornus) in worshipping of any thing as God, which is not God. So they, most Theologically and truly.
CHALLENGE. NOw apply you these points of your Definition unto your Host, in the hand of the Priest, which by your owne Con∣fessions may possibly be, and by our proofes cannot possibly but be (after Consecration) Bread still, whereunto notwithstanding hee prostrateth himselfe, sweareth, by, and invocateth upon, as being in it selfe the person of Christ; the Priest himselfe saying, Nos visibili Sacramento invisibi∣le Corpus Christi praesens, adeoque Christum ipsum in∣vocamus, & quasi divinum quoddam adoramus, & quasi vivum quiddam ra∣tionabile alloqui∣mur, rogamus [O salutaris Hostia, &c.] Espenc. lib. 5. de Ado∣rat. cap. 8. fol. 185 & ibid. lib. 1. cap. 9. fol. 25. O holy Host, &c. O Lambe of God, &c. whereby also, accor∣ding to your Definition of Idolatry, you your selves do seeke to professe, and thereby to beget in others an opinion of a God∣head in the Sacrament, as whereunto Divine honour doth pro∣perly belong. How then can you free your selves from the Crime of formall Idolatry, by pretence of Ignorance, and error of true knowledge of the thing falsly adored, seeing that Idola∣try (as you your selves have also defined) is an Error and Igno∣rance in the judgement of the Worshipper? This were, as if one, defining a disease to be a Distemperature of Humours, should notwithstanding therefore deny a man to be sicke, because his humours are distempered. II. That Romish Worship is proved to be Formally Idolatrous, by Consequence taken from a Romish Principle, concer∣ning Co-adoration, or joynt-worship of Christ with Bread. SECT. II. CO-adoration is when any thing is worshipped joyntly with God in a Divine Worship, which worship by the Law of God (which saith, Thou shalt have no other Gods but mee) is per∣fectly Idolatry, by your owneIdololatria est, non solùm cum ado∣ratur Idolum, relicto Deo, sed etiam cùm adoratur idolum si∣mul cum Deo. Exod. 20. [Deos aureos, & Deos argenteos non facietis mecum.] Bel∣larm. lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 24. §. Praetereàa.

Vasquez. Ies. quo supra. Bread is not to be adored in the Sacrament with Christ's Body, lest that the people, being not able to distinguish the Body of Christ from Bread, should fall into Idolatry. And the person communicating Orally (as you say) the Body of Christ, now in his mouth, is not to be adored Regularly,
but why?Sacramenta haec in sumente ho∣mine, quià quamdiù in eo Sacramentali∣ter sunt incertum est, nec regulariter, nec ordinariè solent ado∣rari.—Praeceptor meus D. Ioh. Bene∣dictus, Magnum Do∣minicani ordinis or∣namentum, docuit, majus esse Idololatriae periculum, si Christus adoraretur in homine, quià homo est subjectum rationis capax (honor est autem praemium virtutis) sign a verò sacra non propter se, sed propter res, quas figurant & exhibent, sunt veneranda, in ijs rantum periculi non inest, quàm si homines peculiari hoc honore propter sumptum sa∣cramentaliter, & sic aliquandiù Christum in eis habitantem prosequeremur. Sic enim homines paulatim Deos esse putaremus. Espenc. de Euch. lib. 1. cap. 6. fol. 14. Because (say you) man being capable of honour, it might fall out, by little and little, that hee should be honoured as God. So your owne Iesuites and Others. Yet (not to do you wrong) in this Contemplation Christ, by reason of the Hypo∣staticall Vnion of his God-head (being no meere Creature) is wholly excepted: whom wee are taught by the Fathers of a GenerallConc. Ephesin. Tom. 1. c. 12. §. Pari. Neque homi∣nem cum verbo adorandum dicimus, sed unum eundemque, nè illud cum verbo aliquam divisionis imagina∣tionem meriti objiciat. Et Tom. 4. c. 26.—Adoratione verò non seorsim Deum, nec seorsim hominem, sed unum Christum. Councel to adore, not in both his distinct natures, but whole Christ. CHALLENGE. WEe suppose that there is not any of your owne Romish Sect, albeit most superstitious, who would worship with Divine Worship either the Signes, or the Appearance of flesh, or the Priest, whiles the Sacrament is in his mouth, with∣out at least a Morall Perswasion, viz. that hee may so do; nor without a Good intent, viz. that it is well done; nor without ha∣bituall Condition, viz. not to do so, if hee knew they were but Signes, Apparance of flesh, or hee meerely a Priest. If therefore there be any Idolatry, in adoring any of these things with Christ, then certainly much rather (which is your Case) is it Idolatry to worship with Divine honour, Bread, it being without Christ. III. That the Romish Worship is proved to be Formally Ido∣latrous in your Masse, by a Consequence from Romish Doctrine, touching Canonization of Saints. SECT. III.

Marginals) you shall find that the Common opinion of your Church directeth you to thinke, that your Church cannot erre in this Function, and that all Christians are bound to be∣lieve the same; but how? upon a Morall and Conjecturall per∣swasion onely? No, upon a Divine and infallible Certitude, and why? Because (say they) if one Saint may be doubted of, then might also the Canonization of others be called into Question, so that it would be dangerous to worship any Saint, lest that wee should
worship a dead and a rotten, instead of a lively member of Christ: which were an Error pernicious, seeing that every lye, figment, and falshood in religious worship must needs be abominable unto God.

Cùm igitur ibi non existat Christus, sed creatura pro Christo inveni∣tur, cui exhibetur Latria, atque ideò Idololatria est. Idòlolatrae enim etiam hâc errant ratione, qùi coelum (puta) aut aliquid aliud adorabunt, putantes se ibi adorare Deum, quem animam Mundi dicebant, juxta Var∣ronis Theologiam. Non igitur excusantur ab Idololatria, quòd arbitrarentur se unum Deum colere, sicut verè erat unus Deus: sed quod illum ibi adorabant, ubi non erat eo modo, quo esse existimabant. Ibid. pag. 134. 135. deduceth a necessity of an infallible assurance of the Canonization of every Saint, from the Infallibility which ought to be had, concerning the Consecration of the Eucharist, Thus; If the Worshipper may be deceived in adoring the Host, by mistaking Bread for the Body of Christ, then should it be Idolatry (saith hee) aswell as in the Hea∣then, who adored Heaven instead of God. So hee. Do you marke? aswell Idolatry, as that of the Heathen; whom neither Morall Certainty, nor Good Intent, or Habituall Condition could ever free from a formall Idolatry. Our Argument, from your owne Confessions, will be this. Whosoever may be mistaken, in adoring Bread instead of Christ's Body, may therein be held as Formall an Idolater as any Heathen. (This is your Bishops Proposition.) The Assumption. But any man among you may manifoldly be deceived, in taking Bread for Christ's Body. (Which hath beene your generall Con∣fession.) Our Conclusion must be; Therefore any of you, in adoring Bread for Christ, in this Sacrament, may be a Formall Idolater.
IV. That the Romish Worship is proved to be a Formall Ido∣latry, by the Consequence used from the Conse∣cration of your Popes. SECT. IV. SAlmeron, a Iesuite of prime note in your Church, endea∣voureth toFides divina est, quâ credimus Ie∣sum, eâdem credimus hunc esse Paulum Quartum Pontificem &c.—Non tantum humanâ fide, cui sub∣esse possit falsum. Salmeron. Ies. in Epist. Pauli part. 3. Disp. 2. pag. 183. 184. Alio∣qui eam adorare for∣midarem. pag. 185. prove that all men are bound to believe the new Pope, whensoever hee is Consecrated, to be the true Pope, not onely with a Morall or Humane Assurance, but with a Di∣vine and infallible Faith; as were the Iewes bound to believe Christ Iesus, at his coming, to be the true Messias: that is (saith hee) with a Faith that cannot possibly be deceived. Wee have no∣thing to do with your Iesuits Position in this place, concerning the Infallibillity of Beliefe of the Creation, and Election of your Popes, which wee have elsewhere proved to be aSee the Grand Romish Imposture, &c. Grosse Imposture. But wee are to argue from his Supposition, as for Example. CHALLENGE. YOur IesuiteSi enim fides nostra penderet ex externa intentione Ministri, commodum nobis esset repetere Baptismum in ea for∣ma, quam instituit Alex. 3. Papa, [Si baptizatus es, ego non baptizo te, &c.] cumque non magis constet nobis de se∣cundo hoc Baptismo, quam de priori, esset tertiò, quartò, & quintò Baptismus re∣petendus. Salmeron. ibid. pag. 188. Et proinde liberum erit, an ista consecrata sit hostia, & debito a∣dorationis cultu a∣doretur, & ad salu∣tem percipiant, & an verè sint Ministri Christi. Ibid. pag. 187. Signanter dixi, sub fidem divinam. pag. 184. § Vt ergò. grounded his Assertion of an Infallible faith due to be had, touching the Creation of your Popes, upon a Supposition; and his Conclusion upon the like infallible Be∣liefe, which men ought to have, concerning the Consecration of the Eucharist, wherein (saith hee) if there should be any Vncer∣tainty, so that our Faith should depend upon the Intention of the Priest, in like maner might every one doubt, whether hee may adore the Sacrament, as being not truly consecrated; as also make doubt of the Priest himselfe, as being not rightly ordained. So hee; who therefore in all these requireth a Faith infallible. All these fore-cited Confessions of your owne Divines, as first concer∣ning your Definition of Idolatry; next in the point of Co-adora∣tion of the Creature together with the Creator; thirdly, in your Beliefe of the Canonization of Saints; and lastly, in the Crea∣tion of the Pope, which are but humane Institutions, do enforce much more a necessity of Infallibility, in every Adoration in∣stituted by God. Now among all the Schismes of Anti-Popes, sometimes of two, sometimes of three at once, and that for forty or fifty yeares space together, if any one of those Popes, in his time, had heard any Papist saying to him: you may not be offended, although I hold your Adversary (as for example Vrbane) to be the true Pope, and yield to him all Fealty and Obedience, for I do this to a Good Intent, in a Morall Certainty, that hee is truly elected Pope; and in an habituall Condition, not to acknowledge
him, if I knew him not to be Pope, wherein if I erre, it is but a Materiall Disloyalty; would not the Pope, notwithstanding all these Pretenses, judge this man to be Formally an Anti-Papist, and pierce him with his Thunder-bolt of Anathema, as Popes have often dealt with Cardinals, Princes, and Emperours in like Case? yet what is this Glowormes slimy shine to the glory of Divine Majesty? {fleur-de-lys} An Answer to a Conceited and Deceiptfull Impious Objection of a bold Spectacle-maker, a Iesuite; Shewing his Spectacles to be but Counterfeit. SECT. V. YOur Iesuit, in his Booke of Spectacles, made in Confuta∣tion of a Iudicious and Religious Knight, among many other of his Paradoxes and Absurities (as if concerning our present Question hee had meant to excell himselfe, in the same kinde) after his most diligent search into every Cor∣ner, where to finde an Evasion, by the helpe of Spectacles of his own making, yet could spie no other, than that poore little Crevise, specifyed in his words following: If Christ (saith hee) be not there, (in the Sacrament after Consecration) wee are in danger to worship him, where hee is not; and if he be there, then are you in danger, in not worshipping him, where hee is. How then are you Protestants more safe than wee? So your Ie∣suite. But most Sophistically. In Answer whereunto, the Protestants can say no lesse, than that this Objection is Falla∣cious, Impious, and Impudent. The notable Sophistry whereof appeareth in this; because of an Extreme Dispa∣rity betweene your Romish Terme of Worshipping by a Con∣jecturall Supposition, as, [I adore thee ô Christ, if thou be here,] and the Protestants Resolution of [not adoring with Divine honour] at all, that, which you your selves do not infallibly believe to be God. For that there ought to be no perfor∣mance of Divine worship, where there can be any danger of Idolatry, as is both proved by your owne Confessions, and illustrated by your owne Similitudes. Your Confessions stand thus. I. Although there should be a possibility of Existence of the Body of Christ with the substance of Bread;See above, Ch. 7. Sect. 2. yet not to adore it, for feare of Idolatry. Item, Although Christ be in the mouth of the Communi∣cant, See in the same place. yet not to adore it there, for feare of Idolatry. Item, Al∣though it be possible Christ is there at all,See ibid. Sect. 3. & 4. in the Chal∣lenge. yet not to adore ab∣solutely, because of the Possibility, that one may be deceived. Next, do but also Recognize your owne Similitude ofSee above, Chap. 6 § . Ia∣cob lying with Leah, instead of Rachel: and, that you may
make a more joynt Application, suppose that both these Si∣sters had beene presented before Iacob, masked and un∣knowne; would your Iesuite judge it to be a like security and safety in Iacob, to have taken either of them to his bed, be∣cause it was posible hee might have made choice of his owne wife, as it had beene to have abstained from admitting of either at that time, lest hee might have made choice of not his owne wife? Wee have furthermore in the title of this Section called this an Impious Answer and Evasion; which wee are to prove from the Resolution, which Christ gave in his An∣swer to the woman of Samaria, when she boasted of the wor∣ship of the Samaritanes, and preferred it before the Religion of the Iewes, a Religion which was then approved and pro∣fessed by Christ himselfe: You Samaritanes (saith Christ) worship you know not what; But wee (Iewes) know what wee worship, Ioh. 4. 22. where, our Lord, who is Truth and Life, determineth the Cause it selfe, namely, that if the Case so stand, in point of Gods worship, The worshipping of not knowing what, is damnable; and onely, the worshipping of knowing what, is justifiable. And this was alwaies Catholike learning, in all Ages, untill your Romish Tyranny brought in this Samaritan kind of [Worshipping you know not what.] Wherein your worshippers faile most blindly both for mat∣ter, for maner, and for sense; as may be proved by the Igno∣rance of your worshippers; both concerning the Objects, Language, and Ceremonies of their worship. Nor could this objection be made by this Iesuite, without some tincture of Impudencie, forasmuch as hee, by a seeming Case of Indifferencie, seeketh to excuse his Romish Sect from Idolatry, for feare of [Danger of not adoring Christ where hee is,] when as notwithstanding, hee, with all his Complices, would condemne Protestants for arrant Heretikes and Con∣temners of Christ in [not adoring him (according to the Ro∣mish Religion) where (peradventure) hee is.] And this they do against all warrant of Antiquity; or else shew us, if you can, when ever any, that had the Title of a Father in the Church of Christ, allowed of any thing to be adored, with Divine Worship, without an Infallible perswasion of the Deity there∣of. Not to repeat the above specified Confessions of your owne Doctors against this very Delusion. But what talke wee of Christian learning? Do but get by heart the Contents of the next Sections following, and then you will perceive, how much it importeth us to be zealous, in oppugning your thus professed Romish worship.{fleur-de-lys}
CHAP. VIII. Of the Romish maner of Adoration, in Comparison with the Heathen. That the Romish Adoration, by your former Pretences, justi∣fieth the vilest kind of Idolatry among the Heathen. SECT. I. THere is a double kind of Worship, the one is Di∣rect, and terminate, which pitcheth immedi∣atly upon the Creature, without Relation to the Creator, whereof your Cardinall Alan hath resolved, saying;Dicimus ad ple∣nam resolutionem, cùm cultus termina∣tur ad ipsas creaturas, Idololatriam esse in∣justam. Alan. de Sa∣cram. in Gen. cap. 23. The terminating and fix∣ing of Divine Honour upon any Creature, is a no∣torious Idolatry. The second kind is Relative Honour, having Relation to Christ; whereof your Cardinall Bellarmine hath determined, saying,Latria est cultus Deo proprius, nec per se deferendus i∣magini, ratione Rela∣tionis. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. ca. 24. §. Tertio.—Hic cultus, si exhi∣betur imagini prop∣ter se, est vera Ido∣lolatria. Ib. §. Dicet.—Si idem cultus ex∣hibetur imagini pro∣pter aliud, ut aequè colatur creatura at{que} Deus, certè est Idolo∣latria: nam Idolo∣latria est non solùm cum adoratur Idolū, relicto Deo, sed eti∣am cum adoratur si∣mul cum Deo. Ibid §. Praetereà.—Imagini non convenit cultus internus verus La∣triae, nec externus proprius, qualis est Sacrificium. Ibid. §. Quarta.—Qui colebant Imaginem Christi divinis honoribus, inter Haereticos numerantur ab Epiphanio, Augu∣stino, & Damasceno. Atque isti cum Christum colerent, sine dubio imaginem ejus propter ipsum colebant: non igitur Imagines licet divinis honoribus colere, i.e. cultu latriae, etiamsi quis dicat, id esse facere propter Deum, vel Christum, non propter imagines. Ibid. §. Sexta ratio. Haec Bellarminus. When [Latria] or divine worship is given to an Image, because of the Relation it hath to Christ, this is Ido∣latry, although it be given for Christ, or God, whether it be inter∣nall, or else externall, as Sacrifice. So hee. This wee say, first to put you in mind ofSunt benè multi, qui imagines colunt, non ut signa,—sed magis eis sidunt quàm Christo. Polydor. Virgil. Invent lib. 6 cap. 13. Very many of your Romish People, who adore Images Idolatrously; which although you would cloake, yet the Complaints and out-cries of your owne RomishManife∣stius est, quàm ut verbis explicari possit, cultum nimium invaluisse, ità ut ad summam Paganorum adorationem nil à nostris reliqui sit factum. Cassander Consult. Art. 21. Dici non porest, quanta superstitio, ne dicam Idolo∣latria alatur apud rudem plebem. Agrippa de Vanit. cap. 57.

Au∣thors will not suffer it to be concealed, One of them saying, that this your worship is more manifest than can be denied; even immediatly and terminately given by your people to the thing it selfe, which they see and adore, and which all Christian lear∣ning teacheth to be Heathenish, in an high Degree. And also note infinite numbers of your Worshippers, who adore Idola∣trously, in the same maner of Relation, that which is here con∣demned by your Cardinall. But to the point, your owne IesuitesFuerunt ex Ethnicis, qui simulachra adorabant, quià ea a∣nimata esse credebant divinis spiritibus. Greg. Valent. lib. 1. de Idol. cap. 2. pag. 60.

Heathen Idolaters did worship Idols, beleeving that They were inspired with a Divine Spirit; next that they had soure kinde of perswasions for this their Beleefe, to wit, the Instructions of their Paganish Priests, the Example of the whole world in their times, the power of Devils, speaking in the Images; and lastly, an hu∣mane shape, which was presented unto them: neverthelesse so, that they sometimes honoured not the things themselves, but the Spirit which they thought them possessed withall. Will you permit us to compare this with that which you have called but yourSee above. Materiall Idolatry? To this end, wee are to try whether there hath beene any Pretence, for justifying your Romish, which might not as truly excuse and warrant that Heathenish Worship; which notwithstanding no Christian will deny to have been most Formally, and properly Idolatrous. Your Morall, and Conjecturall Certainty would be compared in the first place. This the Heathens might pretend by the Reasons, by you already confessed, to wit, the Prescriptions of their Priests, their Idols speaking, and the Example of almost the whole vast world adoring them. Secondly, you please your selves with your Good Intent, that, in worshipping the Bread, you thinke to adore Christ; and the Pagans (which also the whole world of Idolaters professed of themselves, and you your selves have confessed of them) in their most Formall Idolatry, were perswaded they worshipped a True God. Thirdly, you relye upon an Habituall Condition, namely, that although the thing which you adore, be Bread, yet your inward Resolution is not to give Divine Honour unto it, if you knew it were but Bread, and not Christ. But inquire you now into your owne Bibles, and you shall find that the Heathen were not inferiour unto you in this Modification also; for in the History of Bell and the Dragon it is read, that the King of Babel, and other Babylo∣nians worshipped Bel with Divine honour, thinking it to live, untill such time as Daniel had discovered it to be but an Idol: and no sooner had the King perceived the Delusion, but pre∣sently he commanded it should be demolished. The Case then is plaine. Hee, and they, who abhorred, and uterly destroyed that Idoll, assoone as they knew it not to be God, were there∣fore, before that, habitually in their hearts resolved not to ho∣nour it, if they could have beene perswaded it had not beene a God. In such just Equipage do these your Romish, and those Heathenish walke together, that from these your owne Pre∣mises, you may take your Conclusion out of the mouth of your owne Archbishop, whom you have heard affirme, thatSee above, Ch. 7 Sect 2. at (a). If in the worship of this Sacrament (saith hee) wee may be deceived, in mistaking Bread, instead of Christ; then is this worship as meerly Idolatrous, as was that of the Heathen. So hee. Which sheweth your Cause and theirs, in these Respects, to be all one. Wee proceed a step further.
That the Romish Worship of that, which may possibly be Bread, may seeme to be in one respect worse than almost the worst of the Pagans. SECT. II. ALthough the very Title of this Section may seeme unto you fully odious, yet let Truth (in what apparrell soever it shall appeare) be gracious unto you. Costerus is a Iesuite much privileged by your Church, who doubted not to affirme, that Talis error est, quo in orbe ter∣rarum nunquàm vel visus, vel auditus fu∣it—tolerabilior e∣nim est error eorum, qui pro Deo colunt statuam auream, aut alterius materiae i∣maginem, quomodò Gentiles suos Deos venerabantur, vel pannum rubrum in hastam elevatum, quod narratur de Lappis, vel viva ani∣malia, ut quondàm Aegyptij; quàm eo∣rum qui frustum pa∣nis. Coster. Ies. En∣chirid▪ de Sacram. Eu∣charist. cap. 8. §. De∣cimo. If Christ be not in this Sacrament, but Bread onely, the Errour (saith hee) is more intolerable than was the Errour of the Heathen, in worshipping either a golden Statue, or a Red Clout. So hee. What reason hee had to speake so broad Language, wee referre to your Inquisitors, to question him for it. But what Cause wee have for the confirming our Title of this Section, wee shall not forbeare to impart unto you. It is the profession of your Church to Adore that which may be Bread in the Eucharist with Divine Worship, notwithstanding whatsoever Vncertainty of the pre∣sence of Christ therein, by reason of (as your Iesuite Suarez See above. Chap. . Sect. 6. speakes) almost infinite Defects, which may possibly happen to cause the same. Contrariwise the Heathen Idolaters, tou∣ching the things which they worshipped,See in the for∣mer Section at (d). Credebant (said your Iesuite) They believed them certainly to have beene Gods. For although some Heathen would sometime make some doubt of a [] or, [] what, or who the God was, whom they did a∣dore, as they that said, Sive tu Deus es, sive tu Dea es; Whether thou be God or Goddesse; And the Athenians had anAct. 27. 23. Altar , To an unknowne God, yet hardly shall you ever find any Example of the Heathen, doubting [] Whether it were a God, which they worshipped as God; those of Calecute, and such like Devillish Nations excepted, who are said knowingly to have Adored Devils, but (as some people sometime do homage to Tyrannous Vsurpers, knowing them not to be their lawfull Soveraignes) onely Nè noceant, for feare of hurt. So abominable is your Masse-worship, being both contrary to expresse Scripture, which exacteth of every manHeb. 11. . That cometh to God, that hee must believe, what? [] If hee be? no, but [] That hee is God; and also against the light of grace in all Christians, before the darknesse of Popery began; yea and against the light of nature in the very Pagans. For al∣though you do but seeme to symbolize with them in that one part of Idolatry, thus described by the Prophet;Esay 44. 15 &c Hee taketh wood, burneth it, maketh Bread, and of a part thereof maketh a God, and falling downe before it, prayeth, Deliver mee, for thou art my God: (Like as is the taking a lumpe of Dough, baking it, and
with part of it to feed our Bodies, of another part to make a God, worship it, and invocate upon it, according to your owne vul∣gar Rimes: Non est Panis, sed est Deus, Homo liberator meus: fit cibus ex pane, caro Deus ex elemento: Qui me creavit sine me, creatur mediante me;) yet notwithstanding do you farre excede them, by adoring onely in an Habituall Condition, If the thing be God, which you worship; Therefore shall they be your Iudges. CHAP. IX. Our Examination of the Reverence professed by Pro∣testants, and the Securitie of their Profession therein; First, defining and distinguishing the Properties of Reverence. SECT. I. REverence is a due Respect had unto things or per∣sons, according to the good qualities that are in them. This is either inward, or outward. The inward is that our Estimation of them, accor∣ding to their Conditions and Properties: the outward is our open Expression of our said Estimation, whe∣ther by words or Acts. First of the inward Estimation, whether Naturall, Politicke, Religious, or Divine. Children (for Ex∣ample sake) are taught by Scripture to honour their Parents, Wives their Husbands, Husbands their Wives, Subjects their So∣veraignes, People their Pastors; And all, above all, to honour God. Our outward Manifestation of these, be it either in word, or deed, or Gesture, is to be discerned and distinguished by the Inward, as the honour to Parents to be called Naturall; of Sub∣jects to Governours, Politique; of People to their Pastors, Religi∣ous; of All to God, Divine, which is transcendently Reli∣gious, and Spirituall. And the Outward is common to each Degree; three onely outward Acts excepted, Sacrificing, Vow∣ing unto, and Swearing by: Homages appropriated to the Ma∣jestie of God; Sacrifice to betoken his Soveraignty; Vowing to testifie his Providence; and Swearing for the acknowledg∣ing of his Wisedome in discerning, Iustice in condemning, and Omnipotencie in revenging all Perjury, be it never so secret.
That the Reverence used by Protestants, in receiving this Sa∣crament, is Christianly Religious. SECT. II. THeir Inward, is their religious Estimation of this Sacrament, in accounting the Consecrated Elements to be in them∣selves Symbols and Signes of the precious Body and Blood of Christ, a Memoriall of his death, which is the price of mans Redemption, and to the Faithfull a Token of their spirituall Vnion with all the Members of Christ; and by the incorporation of them, in their flesh, a Pledge of their Resurrection unto life. Secondly, their outward Application, for testifying their in∣ward estimation, consisteth not essentially in any one peculiar Gesture in it selfe, as you willConc. Carth. 6. Can. 20. Quoniam sunt quidam, qui die Dominico slectunt genua in diebus Pen∣tecostes: placuit san∣ctae & magnae Syno∣do cunctos—stantes Deum orare debere. Durant. de Ritib. lib. 3. cap. 2. num. 21.

Ratio ex Am∣brosio Serm. 21. de Pentecoste, quia Re∣surrectionem Domi∣ni celebremus: & ut Hieron. Proem. in E∣pist. ad Ephes. Non lectimus genua, non cuvamur in terra, sed cum Domino sur∣gentes ad alta sustol∣limus. confesse from Antiquity, whe∣ther it be in Standing, Bowing, Kneeling, or the like; even be∣cause the Gestures of Vncovering, Bowing, and Kneeling, are outward behaviours communicable to other persons besides God, according to their Naturall, Morall, Politike, and Religious respects. Howbeit, any of these outward Gestures, which car∣ry in them a greater respect of Reverence, may be injoyned by the Church (whereunto obedience is due) according to the just occasions inducing thereunto. And where there is no such ne∣cessary occasion, there the publike observation of the Rites of Communicating, commanded by Christ in his first Institution, performed (namely) by Supplications, and Praises, is a plaine profession of Reverence; and more especially that Invitation, used in most Churches Christian, of the Priest to the People, Lift up your hearts; and their answerable Conclamation, Wee lift them up unto the Lord. It will be objected by Some, who pretend to have some Pa∣tronage from Calvin, that Kneeling at the receiving of the Com∣munion is Vnlawful. Every such One is to be intreated to be bet∣ter acquainted with Calvin, where, speaking of the Reverence of kneeling, hee saith,Calvin. Insti∣tut. lib. 4. §. 37. Iam verò longius prolapsi sunt (viz. Papistae) ritus enim excogitâ∣runt prorsùs extran∣os, in hoc, ut signum divinis honoribus af∣ficiant. At Christo (inquiunt) hanc ve∣nerationem deferi∣mus. Primùm si in coena hoc fieret, dice∣rem eam esse adora∣tionem legitimam, quae non in signo re∣sidet, sed ad Christū in coelo sedentem di∣rigitur. It is lawfull, if it be directed not to the Signe, but to Christ himselfe in Heaven; which is the resolute profession of our English Church, in the use of this Gesture. {fleur-de-lys} And the use of Bowing towards the Lords Table hath in it no other nature or meaning than Daniel his Kneeling with his face towards Ierusalem and the Temple. For as this was a Testification of his joynt-Society, in that reli∣gious worship, which had beene exercised in the Temple and Altar thereof at Hierusalem: so ours is a Symbol of our uni∣on in profession with them, who do faithfully Communicate at the Table of the Lord. {fleur-de-lys} But to returne unto you, who thinke it no Reverence, which is not given by Divine Adoration
of this Sacrament, wee aske, Do not you use the Sacrament of Baptisme Reverently? you do, yet do you not adore the water with that [] which you yield unto the Eucharist. All this notwithstanding, Calvin his estimation of this Sacrament see∣meth but prophane to many of you: but the Reason is, you would rather condemne him, than judge him, lest that his Do∣ctrine, if it come to examination, might condemne you. For al∣beit hee abhorre your Divine Adoration of the Host, yet doth he alsoCalvin. deens. Sanct. Doct. advers. Westphal.

Your next Question will be, after this our Discovery of the manifold Perplexities, wherein you, by your Romish Doctrine, are so miserably plunged, how Protestants can avoid, in many of them, the like Intanglements. That Protestants, in their Profession and Practice, stand secure from the first two Romish Perplexities, in respect of Prepara∣tion of the Elements, and undue Pronunciation of the words of Consecration. SECT. III. OVr Church commandeth that the best Bread and Wine be provided for this best of Banquets, the Supper of our Lord; yet doth it beleeve, that Christ the Ordainer thereof will not deprive the soules of his guests of their desired spirituall Bles∣sings, for the negligence of his steward, in being defective to provide the Materiall Elements, if so be that there be therein (according to Christ his Institution) the substance of Bread and Wine. As for Pronunciation, you know, Protestants make their Celebration in a tongue knowen unto all the people communi∣cating, and in a loud voice, according to the universall Practice of the Church of Christ in primitive times, asSee above, Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. 7. hath beene confessed. So that the Peoples eares may be their owne wit∣nesses, whether the words of Consecration, either by Prayer, or together with the forme of Repetition of the words of Institu∣tion, be truly delivered: which freeth them from your Ro∣mish perplexity of not knowing whether the Priest hath truly Consecrated, by his muttering of the words in an unaudible voice.
The Protestants Security, in respect of the third Romish Perplexity, of Adoring in a Morall Certaintie. SECT. IV. OVr Profession is to adore Christ with an infallible faith, and not with a conjecturall Credulity, or Probability, as wee are taught by the holy Scripture, the Canonicall founda∣tion of Christian faith; defining Faith to be anHeb. 11. 1. Evidence of things not seene; namely, a more infallible apprehension of the minde, than any perception of sight can be; a faith requi∣red of every one, which shall approach in supplication to God: Heb. 11. 6. Hee that cometh to God must beleeve that God is. Infallible faith then must usher Prayer, yea and preaching also any funda∣mentall doctrine of beleefe, as it is written,Psal. 116. 10 & 2. Cor. 4. 13. I beleeved, there∣fore I spake. Yea, without divine Faith, it is impossible to use any religious Invocation:Rom 10. 14. How shall they invocate on whom they have not beleeved? So incredible and faithlesse is your Ro∣mish Conjecturall Faith of your worshipping, and Invocating Christ on the Earthly Altar, whereas according to our Chri∣stian Creed of his sitting at the right hand of God in Heaven) wee, because faithfully, doSee the Con∣sent of Fathers above Chap. 4. Sect. 2. Catholikely, and comfortably adore him, where hee infallibly is upon his Throne of Majestie in Heaven.

Jesuite Salmeron, to the con∣trary; grounded upon sound Reasons, (among others, this) that this Perplexitie, and doubt, whether the Priest hath a Due intention in consecrating, worketh to the tormenting of mens Consciences, injury to Gods exceeding bounty and goodnesse, con∣trary to the Iudgement of Antiquity, and in speciall, against that of Saint Augustine; Saepè mihi ignota est Conscientia aliena, sed semper certus sum de divina misericordia. And lastly, because of the Affinity, which it hath with the heresie of the Donatists. So hee. All which turneth to the condemnation of your Doctrine (teaching a necessary Priestly intention) of Noveltie, Impietie, and relish of Heresie. Wee adde to this that saying of the Apostle,Phil. 1. 18. If the word be preached, whether of envie, and vaine glory, or of good will, I rejoyce, and will rejoyce; which proveth that the evill Intention of the Messenger cannot impeach the Benefit of the message of Salvation, and embassage of God. Now there is the like Reason of the word visible (which is the Sacrament) as there is of the Audible. Take unto you a Simili∣tude, in the marginall Testimony of your Iesuite Salmeron, of a Notary publicke making a true Instrument, according to the forme of Court, in the time when he was distracted in his wits; neverthelesse the same Instrument is of use, and for the benefit of the partie who hath it, not through the Intention of the Scribe, but by the will of the Ordainer, and willingnesse and consent of the Receiver. Our fifth Securitie from your Romish Perplexitie, touching Ordination. SECT. VI. TO passe over matters not controverted betweene us, whe∣ther the Minister that consecrateth this Sacrament ought to be consecrated by Ecclesiasticall Ordination to this Function (a matter agreed upon on both sides) the onely question is, if hee that ministreth happen to be an Intruder, and no consecra∣ted Minister, whether this his Defect do so nullifie his Conse∣cration of the Eucharist, that it becometh altogether unpro∣fitable to the devout Communicant. Your Church in this case
sendeth you to inquire after the Godfathers, Godmothers, Priest, or Midwife that baptizeth, to know whether hee have beene rightly baptized; and this not satisfying, shee will have you seeke forth the Bishop, by whom hee was ordained, and so to the Odainer of that Bishop, and so to speere further, and fur∣ther, untill you come to Saint Peter, to see whether each of these were rightly consecrated a Priest, and then to search into so many Church-bookes, to know the Baptisme of each one, without which the Act of this Priest now consecrating is fru∣strate, and your Adoration Idolatrous. Contrariwise wee, in such an indeprehensible Case, (observe that wee speake of an extraordinary Case) wherein the Actor or Act hath no apparent Defect, are no way scrupulous, knowing that things do worke Ad modum Recipientis: as you have heard in the Ex∣ample of preaching the word of God, were it by Iudas, or if you will a transformed Devill, yet the seed being Gods, it may be fruitfull, (whatsoever the Seed-man be) if the ground that receiveth it be capable. Therefore here might wee take occa∣sion to compare the Ordination Romish and English; and to shew ours, so farre as it consenteth with yours, to be the same; and wherein it differeth to be farre more justifiable than yours can be, if it were lawfull, upon so long travelling, to transgresse by wandring into by-pathes. Our last Securitie from the Romish Perplexity of Habituall Condition. SECT. VII. HAbituall or virtuall Condition (as it is conceived by your Professors) standeth thus; I adore this which is in the hands of the Priest, as Christ, if it be Christ; being otherwise not il∣ling so to do, if it be not Christ. What my Masters, Iffs, and Ands in divine worship? These can be no better in your Church than leakes in a ship, threatning a certaine perishing, if they be not stopped; which hitherto none of your best Artificers were ever able to do. For as touching your profane LecturerSuarez. Ies. Simpliciter adoran∣dus est Christus in Eucharistia, & aliud exigere ex iis esset superstitiosum, & va∣nis scrupulis, & super∣stitionibus expositū: neque enim est con∣sentaneum ibi trepi∣dare, ubi non est vel probabilis ratio ti∣mendi, sed potiùs periculum nè dubita∣tione devotio animi minuatur. Tom. 3. qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 65. Sect. 2. Suarez, labou∣ring to perswade you to Adore Christ in the Eucharist simply, without all scrupulizing, saying, It is not fit to feare where no feare is; When as hee himselfe (as you have heard) hath told us that there are possibly incidentSee above, Chap. 5.

Therefore there needeth none other Confutation, than this, of his owne shamelesse Contradiction, which (as you may see) is palpably grosse. So impossible it is for any of you to allay the detestable stench of plaine Idolatry. Certainely, if S. Augustine had heard that a Worship of Latria (which hee every-where teacheth to be proper to God) were performed to Bread and Wine, as the matter of Divine Adoration, hee neither would, nor could have said, in defence thereof, as hee did of the Celebra∣tion of the Eucharist in his owne time, viz.Aug. contr. Faust. Manich. lib. 20 cap. 21. Nos à Cere∣re & Libero Paga∣norum Diis longè absumus. Wee are farre from your Paganish worshipping of Ceres and Bacchus. But as for us Protestants, wee professe no Divine worship of God, but with a Divine, that is, an Infallible Faith, that {inverted ⁂} it is God, whom wee worship; who will not be worshipped, but in spirit and truth. What furthermore wee have to say against your Romish Masse, will be discovered in the Booke following.
THE EIGHTH BOOKE, Of the Additionalls; by a Summary Discovery of the manifold Abominations of the Romish Masse; and, of the Iniquities of the Defenders thereof. THese may be distinguished into Principals, which are Three; the Romish Superstitiousnesse, Sacrilegious∣nesse, and Idolatrousnesse of your Masse: and Accesso∣ries, which are These; Obstinacies, manifold Overtures of Perju∣ries, Mixture of many ancient Heresies, in the Defenders thereof. CHAP. I. Of the peremptory Superstitiousnesse of the Romish Masse; in a Synopsis. SECT. I. MAny words shall not need for this first point. Superstition is described by the Apostle in this one word,Coloss. 2. , that is, Mans will-worship; as it is opposite to the worship revealed by the will of God. What the will of Christ is, concerning the Celebra∣tion of the Sacrament of his Body, and Blood, wee have learned by his last Will and Testa∣ment, expresly charging his Church, and saying, [Do THIS:] pointing out thereby such proper Acts, which concerned ei∣ther the Administring, or the Participating of the same holy Sa∣crament. But now cometh in Mans will-worship, ordained in the Church of Rome; as flatly contradictory to the same Command of Christ, by Ten notorious Transgressions, as if it had beene in direct Termes countermanded thus, [Do not This,] (as hath been
Booke 1. thorow∣out. proved:) notwithstanding the former direct Injunction of Christ, or conformable Observation of the holy Apostles, or Con∣sent, and Custome of the Church Catholike; and that without re∣spect had to the due Honour of God, in his worship; or Comfort, and Edification of his People. And then is Superstition most bewitching, when it is disgui∣zed under the feigned vizard of false Pretences (which have bin many) devised by the new Church of Rome, in an opinion of her own wisdome, to the befooling & vilifying of the Ancient Catho∣like Church of Christ: which never esteemed the same Reasons reasonaable enough, for making any Alteration; but (notwithstan∣ding such imaginations) precisely observed the Precept, and Or∣dinance of Christ. But that, which excedeth all height of Superstition, is, when upon the will-worship of man are stamped counterfeit Seales of forged Miracles, as if they had beene authorized by the im∣mediate hand of God; whereof your Legendaries have obtru∣ded upon their ReadersBooke 4. Ca. 2, . Thirteene Examples, to wit, of Ficti∣tious Apparitions of visible Flesh, and Blood of Christ, in the Eu∣charist: which maketh your Superstition Blasphemous, as if God should be brought in for the justifying of Falshood; a Sin abhor∣red by holy Iob, saying to his Adversaries;Iob 13. 4, & 7 You are Forgers of Lies: will you speake deceitfully for God? And furthermore how Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous your Romish Superstition is, you may behold in the Sections following. Of the Sacrilegiousnesse of the Romish Masse, and Defence thereof, in the point of Sacrifice; comprized in this Synopsis. SECT. II. SAcrilege is whatsoever Violation of any sacred Person, Place, or Thing. Now omitting to speake of your Dis∣membring the Eucharist, by administring it but in One kinde (which your PopeBooke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 7. in the Chal∣lenge. Gelasius condemned for a Grand Sacrilege) or of the like points formerly discovered in the first Booke; wee shall insist onely in your Churches Doctrine of Sacrifice, wherein your Sacrifice is found to be grossely Sacrilegious in the Tractate of the Sixth Booke.

Pro∣pitiatory Sacrifice, for Remission of Sins, besides that which Christ offered upon the Crosse. As if after one hath paid the Debts of many at once, upon condition that such of those Deb∣ters should be discharged, whosoever submissively acknowledg∣ing those Debts to be due, should also professe the favour of their Redeemer; It cannot but be extreme folly for any to thinke, that the money once paid should be tendred, and offe∣red againe, as often as One or Other of the Debters should make such an acknowledgment, the Surety having once suffici∣ently satisfied for all. So Christ having once for all satisfied the justice of God, by the price of his Blood, in the behalfe of all penitent Sinners, who in Contrition of heart and a living Faith apprehend the Truth of that his Redemption; it cannot but be both injurious to the justice of God, and to the merit of Christ, that the same satisfactory Sacrifice, as it were a new pay∣ment, ought againe, by way of Satisfaction, be personally per∣formed and tendred unto God.

VI. By transforming (as much as they can) the Sacrament, ordained for Christians to eat with their owne mouthes, into a Ibid. Theatricall Sacrifice, wherein to be fed with the mouth of the Priest.

A New Instance, for proofe of Romish Sacrilegiousnesse, in the Prayer set downe in the Liturgie of their Masse. SECT. III. IN your Missall, after Consecration, it is prayed thus:Missal. Rom. Offerimus Majestati tuae, Domine, im∣maculatam Hostiam sanctum panem vitae aeternae, & Calicem salutis perpetuae—supra quae propitio vultu respicere digne∣ris, sicut dignatus es munera justi pueri tui Abel. And in the next place. Iube haec per∣ferri per manus san∣cti Angeli in sublime Altare tuum coeleste. Wee offer unto thy Majestie, O Lord, this immaculate Host, this holy Bread of eternall life, this Cup of everlasting salvation, upon which vouchsafe to looke with a propitious and favourable Counte∣nance, as thou didst accept the gifts of thy holy servant Abel, and command these to be carried up into thy celestiall Altar, &c. So the Canon of your Masse. Some Protestants, in their zeale to the glory of Christ, impute unto you hereupon a Sacrilegi∣ous Profanenesse, whilest you beleeving That Host, and That Cup to be the very Body, and Blood of Christ, and a Propitiatory Sacrifice in it selfe, yet do so pray God to be propitious unto it, and to accept it, as hee did the Sacrifice of Abel; yeelding thereby no more estimation to Christ, than to a vile sheepe, which was offered by Abel. At the hearing of this, your Cardinall (See theBellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 24. Fa∣cilis est responsio: Non petimus pro Christi reconciliatio∣ne apud Patrem, sed pro nostra infirmi∣tate: etsi enim obla∣tio consecrata ex par∣te rei, quae offertur, & ex parte Christi principalis offerentis semper Deo placebat, tamen ex parte Mi∣nistri & populi astan∣tis, qui simul etiam offerunt, fieri potest ut non place at—Paulò post. Compa∣ratio non est inter Sacrificium nostrum, & Sacrificium Abe∣lis, sed tantùm ratio∣ne fidei, & devotionis offerentium, ut nimi∣rùm tantâ fide offe∣rant, quantâ Abel—quod Sacrificium Abelis non haberet in se, quod Deo pla∣cere, eumque placare possit, quae dicitur Heb. 11. per fidem obtulit Abel Deo Sa∣crificium melius—Ratio.

So also Suarez Tom. 3. Disp. 83. Art. 4. Iube haec, id est, Vota nostra. Et Salme∣ron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 32. sub finem. Mar∣gin) 1. Prefaceth, 2. Answereth, 3. Illustrateth, 4. Reaso∣neth. First of his Preface. The Answer (saith hee) is easie. As if that Objection, which seemeth to us a huge logg in your way, were so little an obstacle, that any might skip over it. But have you never seene men, in trusting too much to their nim∣blenesse, to over-reach themselves in their leape, stumble, fall, and breake their limbes? Semblably hee in his Answer (which is the second point) The meaning of our Church (saith hee) is not to pray for Christs recon∣ciliation, who was alwayes well pleasing to God, but in respect of the infirmity of the Priest and people, that the offering may be ac∣cepted from them. So hee. But whatsoever the meaning of the Priest in his praying is, sure wee are this cannot be the meaning of the Prayer; for the matter prayed for is set downe to be Holy Bread of life, and Cup of Salvation, which you interpret to be Substantially the Body and Blood of Christ in the Sacrament; and the tenour of prayer expressely is, [Vpon which Lord looke propitiously;] wee say, upon which, not upon whom; which point is confirmed in that which followeth. Thirdly therefore hee illustrateth. The Comparison (saith hee) is not absolutely betweene the Sacrifice of Abel, and of Christ, but in respect of the faitb and devotion of the Priest, and people, that they with like faith may offer, as Abel did. But this piece
of Answer is that, which is called in Musicke Discantas contra punctum; for the prayer is directly: [Looke downe propitiously upon these, as thou didst upon the gifts of Abel.] The Compari∣son then is distinctly betweene the Gifts, and not betweene the Givers. Yea but not absolutely so meant (saith hee:) be it so, yet if it be so meant but in part, that Christ, who is Propitiation it selfe, shall be prayed for to be propitiously, and favourably loo∣ked upon by God, the prayer is Sacrilegious in an high degree. Fourthly his Reason. It is knowne (saith hee) that the Sacrifi∣ces of Sheepe and Oxen had nothing in themselves, whereby to paci∣fie, or please God, the Scripture saying, that Abel offered a better Sacrifice than Cain. And againe, God had respect to Abel, and to his Gifts. So hee. Which is the very Reason that perswa∣deth Protestants to call that your Prayer most Sacrilegious, be∣cause whereas the Gifts of Abel were but Sheepe, &c. you, notwithstanding, compare them with the offering up of Christ, saying, [As thou didst the Gifts of Abel.] For although it be true, that the Gift of Abel was accepted for the Faith of the Giver, and not the Giver for his Gift; yet if you shall apply this to the point in Question, then your Gift (in your Opinion) being Christ, and your Givers but simply men, (whom you have cal∣led Priest, and People) it must follow that Christ is accepted for the Faith of the Priest, and People; and not the Priest and Peo∣ple for Christ, which maketh your Prayer farre more abomina∣bly Sacrilegious. And not much lesse is that which followeth, praying God to command his Angel to carry (if the Gift be Hee) Christ into heaven; contrary to the Article of our Catholike Faith, which teacheth us to believe his perpetuall Residence in heaven, at the right hand of the Father. Hee answereth:Bellarm. sup. And so Doctor Hes∣kins (out of Hugo de sancto victore) in his Parliament of Christ, Booke 3. Chap. 395. It is not meant, that God would command his Angel to carry Christ's Body, but our prayers and desires, by the intercession of the Angel unto God for us. So hee. Which is as truly a false Glosse, as the former; for, in the Tenour of your Masse, the Subject of your prayer is [Holy Bread of life, and Cup of salvation.] The prayer is plainly thus; Vpon which, O Lord, looke propitiously: and im∣mediately after, Command [These] to be carried by thy Angel. Marke, [These] viz. That Bread of life, and Cup of salvation; even that, which you call, The Body, and Blood of Christ, as Corporally Present: which maketh your prayer to be Sacri∣legious still, and your Expositors (that wee may so say) mise∣rably Radiculous.
That the former Romish Prayer, as it was Ancient, doth in the (then) true meaning thereof condemne the now Romish Church of the former Sacrilegious Innovation. SECT. IV. FOr to thinke that it should be prayed, that God would be propitious to Christ, were an Execrable opinion, even in the Iudgement of our Adversaries themselves; who for avoy∣dance thereof have obtruded an Exposition, as farre differing from the Text, as doth This from That, or Christ from the Priest, as you have heard. But whither will hee now? Your Cardinall telleth you, that the words of your Romish Canon are ancient, such as are found in theBellarm. l. 2. de Missa, cap. 24. Su∣per quae propitio, &c. habentur apud Am∣brosium post conse∣crationem Lib 4. de Sacram. cap. 6. Rur∣sus Bellar. ibid. Haec verba posita sunt post consecrationem apud Ambrosium lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 6. in Li∣turgijs Iacobi, Cle∣mentis, Basilij, Chry∣sostomi. Missals of Saint Iames, of Clement Pope of Rome, of Basil, of Chrysostome, and of Am∣brose. You will hold it requisite that wee consult with these Liturgies, set out by your selves, for the better understanding of the Tenour of your Romish Masse. The Principall Quaere will be, whether Antiquity in her Liturgies, by praying to God for a propitious Acceptation, and admittance into his Celestiall Altar, meant (as your Cardinall answered) Propitiousnesse towards Priest, and People, in respect of their Faith, and devotion; and not towards the Things offered distinctly in themselves? In the pretended Liturgie ofLiturgia Ia∣cobi antè Conjecrati∣onem. Diaconus. Ore∣mus pro sanctificatis tremendis donis—ut Dominus acceptis eis in super-coeleste spirituale Altare su∣um in odorem suavi∣tatis mittat nobis di∣vinam gratiam. Tum Sacerdos. Deus, ac Pater Domini Dei, & Servatoris—qui tibi oblata munera frugum oblationes accepisti in odorem suavitatis—sancti∣fica animas nostras. Post Sacerdos cense∣crans, verba Conse∣crationis adhibet: Sancte qui in sanctis requiescis—sus∣cipe hymnum incor∣ruptum in sanctis & incruentis Sacrificijs tuis. Saint Iames (before Con∣secration) the prayer to God is, To accept the Gifts unto his cele∣stiall Altar; even the Gifts, which hee called The fruits of the earth. And then after, for the Parties, aswell Priest, as Peo∣ple, To sanctifie their soules. In the Liturgie ofLiturgia Ba∣filij ante Consecrati∣onem. Pontifex—Suscipe nos, ut simus digni offerre rationabile illud abs{que} sanguine Sacrificium—& vide super servitutem nostram: ut susce∣pisti munera Abel, sic ex manibus nostris suscipe ista ex benignitate tuâ. Et rursus Diac. Pro oblatis, sanctifica∣tis, & honorificentissimis muneribus Deum postulemus, ut qui accepit ea in sancto & supercoelesti Altari suo, in odorem suavitatis, emittat gratiam & spiritum nobis, &c. Post, sequitur Consecratio. Pontifex: Respice Domine Iesu. Et post Consecrationem; Gratias agimus. Basil (before Consecration) it is prayed to God, that hee Receiving the Gifts into his celestiall Altar, would also (concerning the Parties) send his Grace, and Spirit upon them. And no lesse plainly PopeClement. Constitut. lib. 8. cap. 16. called, Con∣stitutio Iacobi, apud Binium. Tu, qui Abelis Sacrificium suscepisti—And after, Pro omnibus tibi gloria, &c. cap. 17. Benignè aspicere digneris super haec dona proposita in conspectu tuo—& complaceas tibi in eis, in honorem Christi, & mittas spiritum super hoc Sacrificium, testem passionum ejus—ut ostendas hunc pa∣nem corpus ejus, &c. Post Consecrationem, cap. 19. Etiam rogemus Deum, per Christum suum, pro munere obla∣to Domino, ut Deus, qui bonus est, suscipiat illud per Mediatorem Christum in coeleste Altare suum in odo∣rem suavitatis pro hâc Ecclesiâ, &c. Clemens, teaching (before Con∣secration) to pray God, who received the Gifts of Abel gracious∣ly, to behold these Gifts propounded to the honour of his Son Christ; expresly differencing this Sacrifice, done in honour of Christ, from Christ himselfe, who is honoured thereby. And, after Consecration, to Beseech God through Christ to accept the Gift of∣fered to him, and to take it into his Celestiall Altar: where the
prayer to God is not to accept of Christ, but of the Gift for Christ's sake, and to the honour of Christ, in whom God is Propi∣tious unto us: wee say againe, the Gift for Christ, and not Christ for the Gift, (what can be more plaine against all Corpo∣rall Presence of Christ in the Sacrament?) and to receive it into his Celestiall Altar, but how? by intercession of Angels? No, but expresly thus: By Christ the Mediatour. In the Liturgie ofMissa Chryso∣stomi antè Consecra∣tionem. Adhuc offeri∣mus tibi rationabile, & incruentū hoc ob∣sequium. Deposcimus ut mittas Spiritum sanctum super nos, et super apposita mune∣ra Sequitur Consecra∣tio. Fac Panem istum preciosum Corpus, &c. Post Consecratio∣nem. Adhuc offeri∣mus tibi rationabile hoc obsequium pro fideliter domientib{us}, &c. Post. Dominum deprecemur, ut qui suscepit ea in sancto et coelesti Altari suo, mittat nobis propre∣rea gratiam, et donū Spiritus sancti. Chrysostome (before Consecration) God is prayed unto, and supplicated thus: Wee beseech thee to send thy Spirit upon us, and upon the Gifts set before us. Even asAmbros. de Sa∣cram lib 4. cap. 6. post Consecrationem. Of∣ferimus tibi hunc Pa∣pem sanctum, et Ca∣licem, et perimus ut hanc Oblationē sus∣cipias in sublimi Al∣tari tuo per manus Angelorum, sicut ac∣cipere dignatus es munera pueri tui A∣bel, &c. Ambrose explaineth his Supplication (after Con∣secration) for God, To accept this Oblation, namely that, which hee called Holy Bread, and Cup. If therefore these former Formes may interpret your Ro∣mane Liturgie, as it was Ancient, the prayer therein to God, de∣siring him to be Propitious, must have relation to the things a∣bove specified called Holy Bread of life, and Cup of Salvation, as distinguished from Priest, and People. Wherefore your Ro∣mane Missals being so Ancient in this one point, in praying God (after Consecration) to be Propitious to that, which is called the Bread of life eternall, and Cup of everlasting salvation; lest it might carry a Sacrilegious Sense, to wit, that the Body of Christ is here the proper Subject of the Eucharist, and consequently to need a Propitiation to God, by virtue of mens prayers (thereby greatly derogating from the meritorious Satisfaction of Christ:) you ought to reduce this your Romane Canon to the Orthodox meaning of Ancient Liturgies above mentioned; and to understand it Sacramentally onely, (namely) our Obje∣ctive Representation, Commemoration, and Application thereof by us, which is our Act of Celebration. To the former vast heape of Sacrilegious Positions, and Pra∣ctices, wee may adde your other many vile, and impiousBooke 5. tho∣rowout. In∣dignities offered to the all-glorious Sonne of God, in making his sacred Body, in your owne opinions, obnoxious to the Im∣prisoning in Boxes, Tearing with mens Teeth, Devouring, Vomi∣ting it by the Communicants, and the Transmittance into your guts, yea and into the parts inferior, together with the Eating, and Feeding thereupon by Dogs, Mice, Wormes; and (which tran∣scendeth, if it may be, all your other Absurdities) to be deprived of all naturall power of Motion, Sense, and Vnderstanding. O Abo∣minable! Abominable!
A Synopsis of the Idolatrousnesse of the Romish Masse, and Defence thereof; by many Evidences from Antiquity. SECT. V. OVr first Argument is against the foundation thereof, which is your Interpretation of the Article [HOC] by denying it to have Relation to Bread; contrary to the verdict of an In∣quest of Ancient Fathers, shewing, that the same pointeth out Bread, as you haveBooke 2. Cha. 1. Sect. 6. heard: whereby the monstrous Con∣ception of Transubstantiation is strangled in the very wombe. Insomuch that sometimes they expresselyIbid. interpret it thus; Christs Body, and Blood, that is, (say they) The Bread, and Wine. Item, Hee gave the name of the Signe to the thing signified. Item, Bread the Signe of his Body. And lastly, Bread is called Christs Body, because it signifieth his Body. Secondly (in the point of Transubstantiation it selfe) They calling the Eucharist (which you dare not)Booke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 5. & 11. & Sect. 14. in Chrysost, and by Cyprian his Confutation of the A∣quarii, ibid. Sect. 5. & Book 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 3. Bread and Booke 3. Cha. 3. Sect. 5. Wine, after Consecration, and naming themIbid. Sect. 13. Earthly mate∣rialls, and Matter of Bread: and also (as you have heard out of the Ancient Liturgies)Above in this Booke, Ch. 1. Sect. 4. Fruits of the Earth; and yet more plainely, by way of Periphrasis, describing them to consist ofBooke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 6. Divers granes, and Divers grapes. After, by appro∣ving the Suffrage and judgement of ourBooke 3. Cha. 3. Sect. 8, 9, &c. Senses, in discer∣ning all Sensible things; and in speciall the Eucharist it selfe; and at length affirming that there remaineth therein theBooke 3. Cha. 3. Sect. 11. Sub∣stance of Bread, and Wine, which are the Subject matter of your Divine Adoration. All which are other Three Demonstrations of their meanings, every singular point being avouched by the Suffrages of Antiquity. Thirdly against your Faith, concerning the maner of Corpo∣rall Presence of Christ in the Eucharist; because so farre were the Fathers from beleeving that the Body of Christ could be in Booke 4. tho∣rowout. divers places (as you say in Millions) at one time, that by this property of Being in many places at once, they have discer∣ned Angells to be Finite Spirits, and not God. They have di∣stinguished the Godhead of Christ from his Manhood; and they have proved the Holy Ghost to be God, and no Creature by the same Reason. Than which Three Arguments none can be more Convincent. Whereunto you may adde the Fathers speeches, contradicting your Dreame of a Body whole in every part, in whatsoever space; or place; by judging it Impossible, and also con∣cluding Christ his Ascension into Heaven to argue his Absence from Earth; all which haveIbid. Chap. 7. Sect 6. and Booke 5. . beene discussed from point to point.
Our Fourth Generall Argument is, that whereas your Cor∣porall Presence must needs inferre Corporall Eating thereof by the Communicants, notwithstanding you have heard the con∣trary Sentences of Ancient Fathers, againstBooke 5. tho∣rowout. Tearing, and Swallowing of Christ's Body, and Bodily Egestion. Next concer∣ning the Eaters, that onely the Godly faithfull are partakers thereof; insomuch that even the Godly under the old Testament did eat the same. Then, of the Remainders of the Consecrated Hosts, that they wereBooke. 1. Cha. 2. Sect. 10. Earen (by the ordinance of the Church) by Schoole-boyes, and sometimes Burnt in the fire. Be∣sides they called themBooke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 11. and Booke 7. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Bits, and Fragments of Bread broken (after Consecration) and diminished. And lastly, in respect of the End of Eating.Booke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 11. They held the thing present to be a pledge of Christ's Body absent: and alsoBook 5. Chap. 9. Sect. 2. allowed such a Touch of his Bo∣dy by Faith that whosoever so toucheth him is Sanctified. Which Observations, concerning our Fourth Generall Argument, do minister unto us five particular Reasons, which make our De∣fence to be Impreinable. Fifthly, forasmuch as you teach the Subject matter of the Eu∣charist to be the Body of Christ, as a proper Sacrifice propitia∣tory; wee, upon due inquisition into the doctrine of Antiquity, haveBooke 6. Ch. 3. Sect. 2. thorowout, and elsewhere. found the Ancient Fathers I. Nothing that, which they called Sacrifice herein, to be Bread, and Wine, saying there∣upon that Melchisedech, in that his Bread and Wine, offered the Body and Blood of Christ. II. Such a Subject, which being ta∣ken in great Quantity dothB 3. Chap. 13 Sect. 10 nourish and satiate mans Bodily Nature. III. Such, as needeth prayer to God, that it may be In this Booke 8. Chap. 1. Sect. 3. Acceptable to God, as was the Sacrifice of Abels sheepe. IV. So naming it an Vnbloody Sacrifice, as meaning therebyBooke 6. tho∣rowout, more especial∣ly Chap. 5. Sect. 9, & 10. void of Blood, which cannot agreed to the Body of Christ now risen from death. V. So qualifying their other Exuberances, and Excesse of speech (wherein they named it The same Sacrifice of Christ once offered) by an  correcting it thus;Booke 6. Cha. 5. Sect. 6. A Sacrifice, or rather a Memoriall thereof. VI. By placing the Sacrifice of Christ his Body, as now Presentative onely in Heaven, and the thing of∣fered, on Earth but a Signe. VII. In all your objected Testimo∣nies, for proofe of the same Body of Christ in the Eucharist, which suffered on the Crosse, they understood the same as the Booke 6. Cha. 5. Sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. Object of our Remembrance, and not as the Subject of Offe∣ring, which make up so many Arguments moe. VIII. By paral∣leing In this Booke, Chap. 2. Sect. 2, & 3. Baptisme with the Eucharist, in like tenour of speech, from point to point. IX. By praying God to beAbove in this Booke, Chap. 1. Sect. 3. Propitious to that which is offered. Sixthly, upon the same Doctrine of Corporall Presence you have erected and fastned the roofe of all your Building, which is, Divine Adoration of the Host: yet notwithstanding have you not beene able, by the Testimonies of any ancient Father,
to free your selves from Formall Idolatry, by any of your Booke 7. tho∣rowout. Pretences (devised for your excuse) either of Good Intent, Morall Certainty, or of Habituall Condition: especially seeing that the Fathers, by that their universall Invitation, [Lift up your hearts] abstracted still the thoughts of the Communicants from contemplating of any Subject present here Below, that they might be drawne to the meditation of the Body of Christ, as it is in Heaven. Lastly, in your owne Romish Masse, praying (after Consecra∣tion) God to be propitious to the things offered, as to Abels Sacrifice, which was but a sacrificed Sheepe. Compute all these Particulars, and you shall finde about six∣teene Arguments, to prove you to be absolutely Idolaters. Wee having thus reveiled these Three Principall, and Fundamentall Abominations, do now proceed to their Concomitants and Conse∣quences, which are Mixtures of Heresie in many, Overture of Perjury in some, and Obstinacie in all. Wee begin at the last. CHAP. II. Of the exceeding Obstinacie of the Romish Disputers, made palpable by their owne Contradictions; and of the De∣fence thereof, as being Contradictory in it selfe. SECT. I. ALl your Disputers shew themselves in nothing more zealous, than in maintenance of your Romish Masse, which they contend for by objecting Scriptures, Fathers, and Reasons: notwithstanding their Ex∣positions of Scriptures, their Inferences out of the Fathers, their devised Reasons, and almost all their Confutations are confuted, rejected, and contradicted by their owne fel∣lowes, as the Sections thorowout this whole Tractate do plainly demonstrate. Wee cannot therefore otherwise judge, but that as Prejudice is the chiefe Director, so Obstinacie is the greatest Supporter of your Cause. How much more when the Defence it selfe is found to con∣sist upon meere Contradictories, whereof you may take a Taste out of your Doctrine of Corporall Presence, and of a proper Sa∣crifice. In the first, by obtruding on mens Consciences a Be∣liefe (upon due Consequence) of a Body of Christ Borne, and not
Borne of the Virgin Mary; One, and not one; Finite, and not Finite; Divisible, and not Divisible; Perfect, and not Perfect; and also Glorious, and not Glorious, as hath beeneBooke 4. tho∣rowout. proved in each point. II. In a point of properly Sacrificing of Christ's Body, your Musicke stands upon the same kind of Discords, ofSee Booke 6. thorowout. Teaching a Body Broken, and not Broken; a matter visible, and not visible; of Blood shed, and not shed; and of a suffering Destruction, and not suffering Destruction. Evident Arguments of Obstinacie one would thinke, and yet behold a plainer, if it may be. One Example, instead of many, of a stupendious Obstinacie, in ur∣ging the Iudgement of Antiquity, for Defence of your Ro∣mish Masse, in the chiefect parts thereof; proved by instancing onely in their like Sayings concerning Baptisme. SECT. II. THree chiefe Iesuites, besides others, have beene (as you mayBooke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 13. remember) extremely urgent, and important with Protestants to shew, if they could, the like Phrases of the Fa∣thers in Baptisme, as were used of them concerning the Eucha∣rist, in the question of Sacrifice: as if the just paralleling of these Two might be a Satisfaction unto themselves, concerning that one point. Wee are to deale more liberally with them, and whereas they assume unto themselves the suffrages of An∣tiquity; 1. For a Literall Exposition of Christs words [This is my Body:] 2. For a Change of Bread, by Transubstantiation in∣to his Body: 3. For a Corporall Presence of the same Body in the Sacrament: 4. For a Bodily Vnion with our Bodies: 5. For a Proper Sacrifice of the Eucharist: And lastly, for a Divine Adoration thereof; wee answer them from the Fathers, in their like Sayings concerning Baptisme, throughout every particular.
A Synopsis of the Speeches of Ancient Fathers, ob∣jected throughout this whole Treatise, for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ's Body in the Eucharist; and assoyled and satisfied by the Parallels and like Equivalent Sayings of the same Fathers; to the manifold and ma∣nifest Conviction of all Romish Deli∣ration, in this their Controversie of the Masse.

So many Parallels, so pregnant and punctuall, in so maine points, assoyling Romish Objections in their Instances of grea∣test weight and urgencie; what, but Obstinacie it selfe, could possibly oppose to this Evidence? CHALLENGE. SO many Testimonies of Fathers, so mainly insisted upon by your Doctors, for warrant of such Erroneous, Superstitious, Sacrilegious, and Idolatrous Romish Doctrines, and each one not more vehemently objected, in the Question concerning the Eu∣charist, than easily retorted, and confuted, by instancing in Bap∣tisme; what greater Evidence can any desire to be made of a wilfull Obstinacie (that wee say not madnesse) than this of your Disputers appeareth to be? but how much more, if wee should point at the other manifold Instances, which wee have prosecu∣ted at large throughout this whole Volume, wherein their Vn∣conscionablenesse hath beene manifested in all passages to the
Conscience of every indifferent Reader. Yet were this their Guilt not so hainous, if such their Obstinacie were not infected with some contagion of Perjury. A Synopsis of manifold Overtures of Perjuries, in Defence of the Romish Masse. SECT. IV. EVery Perjury presupposeth an Oath; which you have in the Bulla Pii Quarti super forma Iuramenti—Profite∣or omnia declarata in Concilio Triden∣tino: & hanc esse si∣dem veram Catho∣licam, extra quam nemo salvus esse po∣test. Bull of Pope Pius the Fourth, imposed upon every Eccle∣siasticke, subject to the See of Rome, for the ratifying of the Be∣liefe of the many new Romish Articles contained therein, as True, Catholike, and without which none can be saved. The due proofe that the same Oath, almost in each new Article, maketh the Swearer obnoxious to Perjury, is a Subject which would require a full Treatise; for the which wee are not altogether unprovided. But wee are to confine our selves to the Ob∣servations promised in our former Discourse, in foure speciall points. I. Overture of Perjury is in Swearing unto that, which is called The Vulgar Latine Translation. THis is decreed in the Councel ofSynod. Trid. Sess. 4. Decretum de Editione statuit, ut haec Vulgata editio, quae tot saeculorum usu approbata in Ec∣clesia, in publicis le∣ctionibus, disputatio∣nibus, & expositioni∣bus pro Authentica habeatur, ut nemo illam rejicere quovis praetextu audeat—statuit & decrevit ut haec vetus Editio quàm emendatissimè imprimatur.

Whereunto (together with all other Decrees, and Declarations of the same Councel) you are sworne by the forme of Oath set downe in the foresaid Bull of the Pope.

Valentia, who thinke that Oath to be violated, if the Vulgar Latine be rejected at all, as lesse true than the Originals. And your Spanish Inqui∣sitors finding, in one of your Romish Doctors, the Rule of Hie∣rome, and Augustine urged, which is, that no Translation Latine, or other be further allowed than as it agreeth with the Ori∣ginals, they faire and cleanly wipe it out, saying thatIndex Expur∣gatorius Hispanicus, ad nomen Martinz—Quamvis haec, quae Hieronymus, & Augustinus docuerunt, vera sunt, tamen post Concilii Tridentini Decretum, non licet Vulgatae Latinae Testimonia quovis prae∣textu rejicere, prout in ipsius Concilii Decreto constitutum est. fol. 145. Al∣though that, which Hierome and Augustine taught, be true; yet now since the Councel of Trent it is not lawfull to reject the same Translation upon any pretence whatsoever. {fleur-de-lys} Accordingly your Iesuite Lorinus (in a matter concerning neither faith nor maners)Lorinus Ies. Comment. in Lib. Sap. ca. 12. Versq. 6. §. Vatablus.—Non licet nobis discrepantem expositionem ab Editione nostra Vulgata jam correcta sequi. It is not lawfull for us (saith hee) to follow an Ex∣position differing from the Vulgar Edition, which is now cor∣rected. {fleur-de-lys} So they. And so farre unsatisfied are your Do∣ctors, in taking this Oath. Wee are furthermore not destiture of matter for a large Con∣futation (first) of your assuming Saint Hierome as the Author of your Vulgar Latine Translation; to manifest that it is no more the Translation of Hierome, or yet of any one Author, than the divers habits of a mans Body, from head to foot, can be called the worke of one singular work-man. Secondly, concerning the Authority thereof, you professe it to be Authenticall (that is, as you have defined) Conformable to the Originall Hebrew and Greeke: although it may be as easily proved, not to be that Ancient Vulgar, which had continued (as the Decree speaketh) from divers ages, than the Ship of The∣seus, which after some Ages had beene so thorowly battered and pierced, that at last the keele and bottome therof did onely remaine, which could be called the Same. But passing by all fur∣ther Dispute, wee shall referre you to the judgement of the Pa∣trones of the former Rule (so insolently contemned by the
Spanish Inquisitors, as you have heard) by one Instance, which may be sufficient in it selfe for triall of the Case now in hand. The Text of Scripture is Ephes. 1. 14. in the Latine Transla∣tion (even in that, which is set forth by PopeClem. Octa∣vus—In perpetuam rei memoriam—Textus accuratissime mendis purgatus. Clement, as The most accurate Edition) thus:Ephes. 1. 14. Lat. Vulg. Spiritu signati promissionis, quae est pignus haere∣ditatis. Graecè, : in quem locum Hieronym. Pignus La∣tinus interpres pro Arrhabone posuit: Arrhabo futurae em∣ptionis quasi quod∣dam testimonium, & obligamentum da∣tur: Pignus verò pro mutuâ pecuniâ poni∣tur, & cùm illa reddi∣ta fuerit, reddenti de∣bitum pignus à Cre∣ditore.

Accipis Codicem ab amico, cui das pignus, cum reddideris quod ac∣copisti, illc, cui red∣dis, habebit, tu pig∣nus accipies, non e∣nim habebit ambas res: sed quando pre∣tium paras dare pro ea re, quam tenes bo∣nae fidei contractu, de ipso pretio das ali∣quid, & exit Arrha, non pignus, quod sit complendum, non quod sit auferendum. Sed si Deus charitatem dat, tanquam pignus per spiritum suum, cum eam rem ipsam reddiderit, quâ promissa pignus dedit, auferendum est à nobis Pignus? Absit! Sed quod dedit, hoc implebit: ideo melius Arrha, quàm pignus—hoc enim implebitur, cum Arrha data est. You are sealed with the spirit of promise, which is the Pledge of your inheritance. But in the Greeke it is: You are sealed with the spirit of promise, which is the Earnest of your inheritance. The Question is, whether of these is to be preferred; and Hierome, and Augustine are ready to re∣solve you herein, both of them Correcting the Vulgar Transla∣tion in the word Pledge, and one of them giving an Absit! against this Sense of it. The Reason of both is, because hee that giveth a Pledge taketh it againe, when the Thing, for which it was pledged, is received. But hee that giveth an Earnest, will have it continue with him, to whom it was given. And so God assuring his Chosen, by his Spirit, doth for their greater Confi∣dence give it as an Earnest, and not as a Pledge. So they. Ther∣by advancing Gods gracious love, towards man, and mans faith in Gods love. Here will be no corner of Pretence, that this be∣ing an Errour of Print, and not of Doctrine, may be rejected by you without Prejudice to your Oath; no, for Errour of Print ariseth from some affinity of words, (as where these words, This is a sound Reason, being delivered to the Print, was returned from the Presse thus; This is a fond Reason.) But betweene Pignus, and Arrhabo, there is no more Sympho∣nie than betweene an Horse, and a Saddle. Nor will it avayle you to say that the Originall Greeke was corrupted, for it is the same Greeke word, which Hierome himselfe (who as you know used the perfectest Greeke Text) doth here avow to be True. II. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers is in swearing to the Romish Expositions of Scripture. THe Tenour of the Oath, in this respect, is:Bulla eadem. Sacram Scripturam admitto juxta eum sensum, quem Te∣nuit, & Tenet Ma∣ter Ecclesia—ex∣tra quam nemo sal∣vus, &c. I admit the sacred Scriptures in that Sense, which the Mother Church hath held, and doth hold. By [Mother Church] understanding the Church of Rome, as without which there is no salvation; which is expressed in the same Oath, as another Article therein, and which else-where wee have proved to be a GRAND IMPO∣STVRE, in a full Tractate, from the Doctrine of the Apostles, of Generall Councels, of severall Catholike Churches, and from such Primitive Fathers, whose memories are at this day regi∣stred
in the Romish Calender of Saints. How then can the Oath for this point be taken without danger of Perjury? But to come to the Article, concerning the Expositions of Scriptures Accor∣ding to the sense of the Church of Rome, which would thereby be thought to Hold no Sense of Scripture now, which shee had not Held in more Ancient Times. Wee, for Triall hereof, shall for this present seeke after no other Instances, than such as in this Treatise have beene discussed, and for brevity-sake single, out of many, but onely Three; A first is in that Scrip∣ture, Ioh. 6. Except you eate the flesh of the Son of man, you can∣not have life. The word [Except] was extended unto Infants in the dayes of Pope Innocent the First, continuing (as hath beeneBooke 1. Ch. 2. Sect. 1. confes∣sed) six hundred yeares together, when the Church of Rome there∣upon Held it necessary for Infants to receive the Eucharist. Con∣trarily the now Romane Church Holdeth it Inexpedient to ad∣minister the Eucharist unto Infants, as you have heard. Secondly, Luk. 22. Take, Eate, &c. Your Church of Rome, in the dayes of Pope Nicholas, in a Councel at Rome, Held, that by the word, Eate, was meant anBooke 3. Chap. 5. Sect. 1. Eating, by Tearing the Body of Christ sensually with mens teeth, in a Literall sense. Which your now Romane Church (if wee may believe your Iesuites) doth not Hold, as hath appeared. Thirdly the Tenour of the Institution of Christ, concerning the Cup, was Held in the dayes of PopeBooke 1. Ch. 3. Sect. 7. Gelasius to be pe∣remptory, for the administration thereof, to prove that the Eu∣charist ought to be administred in both kindes to all Communi∣cants, and judging the dismembring of them a Grand Sacrilege, as you have heard: whereas now your Romish Church Holdeth it not onely lawfull, but also religious to with-hold the Cup from all, but onely Consecrating Priests. Vpon these (omitting other Scriptures, which you your selves may observe at your best leasure) wee conclude. You therefore in taking that Oath, swearing to admit all Interpretations of Scripture, both which the Church of Rome once Held, and now Holdeth; the Pro∣verbe must needs be verified upon you, viz. You hold a Woolfe by the eare: which howsoever you Hold, you are sure to be Oath-bit, either in Holding TENVIT, by TENET, or in Holding TENET, by TENVIT. III. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers, is in swearing to the pretended Consent of Fathers, in their Expositions of Scriptures. HEare your Oath.Bulla ead. Nec Scripturam ullam, ni∣si juxtà unanimem Consensum Patrum interpretabor. Neither will I ever interpret any Scrip∣ture, but according to the unanimous consent of Fathers. Here the word [Fathers] cannot betoken Bishops and Fathers
assembled in a Councel, where the major part of voices conclude the lesse; for Councel never writ Commentaries upon Scrip∣tures, but from Scriptures collect their Conclusions. And al∣though the word [Vnanimous] doth literally signifie the uni∣versall Consent (which would inferre an Impossibility, because that all Fathers have not expounded any one Scripture, and ve∣ry few (All) yet that you may know wee presse not too vio∣lently upon you, wee shall be content to take this word Moral∣ly, with this Diminution, For the most part; and hereupon make bold to averre, that your Iuror by this Oath is sworne to a flat Falsity, because you cannot deny but that the Fathers, in their Expositions, dissent among themselves, insomuch that you your selves are at difference, among your selves, which part to side with;Valent. Ies. Anal. lib. 8. cap. 8. Pa∣tet nobis via urgendi unum aut alterum Doctorem authorita∣te reliquorum. With the greater (saith Valentia,) nay but some∣time with theCanus. Ioc. Theol. lib. 7. cap. 3. num. 8. Plurium San∣ctorum authoritas, reliquis licet paucio∣ribus reclamantibus, firma Argumenta sufficere, & praestare non valet. Lesser, (saith Canus.) Can you dreame of an Vnanimity in Disparity? Sometime there is a Non-Constat, what is the Iudgement of the Fathers in some points, which you call matter of Faith. What then? Then (saith yourValent. quo supra. Quod si per Sententiam Docto∣rum aliqua fidei con∣troversia non satis commodè componi posset, eo quod de e∣orum consensu non satis constaret, sua tunc constet Authori∣tas Pontifici, ut con∣sultis aliis ad defini∣endum regulis, de quibus est dictum, Ecclesiae proponat, quid sit sentiendum. Ie∣suite) the Authority of the Pope is to take place, who being guided by other rules may propound what is the Sense. Behold here the very ground of that, which wee call Popery, which is devising and obtruding upon the Church of Christ new Articles of Faith un∣knowne (for ought you know) to Ancient Fathers. And is it possible to find an Vnanimity of Consent in an Individuall Vnity, or rather a Nullity? for what else is an Ignorance, what the Sense of the Fathers is, whether so, or so? Next, that it may appeare that this Article, touching the V∣nanimous Consent of Fathers, is a meere Ostentation and gullery, and no better than that Challenge made by the wise man of Athens of all the Ships, that entred into the Road, to be his owne: as if you should say, All the Fathers do patronize your Romish Cause. Wee shall give you one or two Examples, among your Iesuites, as patternes of the Disposition of o∣thers in neglecting, sleighting, and rejecting the more Generall Consent of Fathers in their Expositions of Scriptures. One In∣stance may be given in your Cardinall, who, in his Commenta∣ries upon the Psalmes, dedicated to the then Pope, professeth himselfe to have composed them,Bellar. Epist. Dedic. Paulo Quinto entè Cōment. in Psal. Psalmorum ego tra∣ctationē magis pro∣priâ meditatione, quam mulâ libro∣rum lectione compo∣sui. Rather by his owne medi∣tation, than by reading of many Bookes; whereas hee that will seeke for Vnanimous Consent of Fathers, must have a perusall of them all. In the second place hearken unto the Accents of your Iesuite Maldonate, in his rejecting the Expositions of the Fa∣thers, as for Example:Maldon. Ies. in Matth. 20. Existi∣mant Patres filios Zebedaei temerè re∣spondisse: ego vero credo eos verè esse locutos. Item in Mat. 16. 18. [Non prae∣valebunt.] Quorum verborum sensus non videtur mihi esse, quē omnes, praeter Hila∣rium, quos legisse memini, Authores putant. Itē in Mat. 11. 11. Variae sunt Patrū opiniones, sed (ut li∣berè fatear) in nulla earum aquiesco. Item in Matth. 11. 13. [Pro∣phetae & lex.] Omnes fere veteres ita exponunt, sed non est apta satis interpretatio. Item in Mat. 19. 11. Non om∣nes capiunt, i e non omnes capimus: Sic omnes fere veteres exponunt, quibus equidem non assentior. Item in Ioh. 6. 62. Sic quidem expono, & licet Expositionis hujus Autorem nullum habeo, hanc tamen magis probo, quā illam Augustini, caeterorum{que} alioqui probabilissimam, quia hoc cum CALVINISTARUM sensu magis pugnat. So indeed said the Fathers, but I be∣lieve
the Contrary. Item, This seemeth not to me to be the Sense of this place, which All, whom I have read, except Hilarie, do thinke. Item, Their Opinions are divers, I rest upon of them all. I∣tem, All Ancients almost do so expound this Text, but this is no fit Interpretation. Item, Thus I expound this Scripture, and albeit I have no Author of this Exposition, yet I do approve it rather than that of Augustine, or of Others, although otherwise most probable, even because it is repugnant to the Sense and Exposition of the CAL∣VINISTS. So hee, and that usually. (O dura ilia!) With what Stomach could this man swallow that Oath? Salmeron the Iesuite may stand for the Third upon that Text, Rom. 5. In whom all have sinned, which teacheth the universall Guilt of Originall Sin of mankinde. What the Sense of the Fathers was from this Text, your Canus will certifie you;Canus  Theol lib. 7. cap. 3. Sanct omnes qui in ejus rei mentionem incidôre, uno ore asseruerunt B. Virginem in origi∣nali peccato concep∣tam fuisse. And then hee rechoneth, adding: Et si nullos contrave∣nerit; infirmum ta∣men ex omnium au∣toritate Argumentū. All they (saith hee) who have formerly fallen upon this subject matter, have confessed, as it were with one mouth, that the Virgin Mary was conceived in Originall sin, no one contrarying this Opinion. So hee, of the Iudgement of Antiquity, which notwithstanding hee durst contradict. But wee returne to your Iesuite, who pre∣mising that this Question doth belong to Faith, propoundeth Saloteron. Ies. in Rom 5. Disp. 49. In quo omnes pecca∣verunt.] Mariam conceptam in origi∣nali peccato, etsi non sit haeresis damnata, nempè tamen ad fi∣dem spectat. Item Disp 51. A qua mul∣titudine Patrum, lo∣cum ab autoritate in∣firmum, &—Pau∣peris est numerare pecus—Exod. 13. In judicio plurimo∣rum non acquitsces sententiae, ut à vero demas: & multitudi∣nem multitudini op∣ponimus. At Devoti erga D. Virg. Resp. Totam Devotionem erga illam non con∣sistere in Patribus, ut in Bernardo, &c. At Antiqui. Resp Quilibet senex lauda∣tor temporis actised & illud asserimus, quo juniores, eo per∣spicactores Doctores esse [After hee wran∣gleth, and wresteth some sayings of Fa∣thers to his part,] In celeberrimâ Pansien∣sium Academâ nul∣lus in Theologia ti∣tolo Doctoris dignus habetur, qui non pri∣mum jusjurandi reli∣gione se adstrinxerit ad hoc Virginis privilegium tuendum. Objections made out of the Fathers, for proofe that the Vir∣gin Mary hath the same Originall defect in her owne naturall Generation, and shapeth Answers full of regret, and reluctan∣cie. For, first, To this Objection; The Fathers did consent: Hee answereth thus; The Argument from Authority is infirme. II. To this; The Fathers were Ancient: Thus; The younger Divines are more quicke of understanding. III. To this; The Fa∣thers were many: Hee answereth; Hee is but a poore man that can number his Cattell. And againe, confronting the Ancient Fa∣thers, and preferring novell Divines, hee saith; Wee oppose mul∣titude to multitude. IV. But The Fathers were Devout: hee an∣swereth; Yet all Devotion towards the Blessed Virgin resteth not in the Fathers. And when one of the Devoutest of them (Ber∣nard by name) is objected, who had said of the point now in Question,Bernard. Epist. 174. Hanc prolis praerogai∣vam B. Mariae tribuere non est honorate Virginem, sed honori detrahere, Et Paulò antè.—Nunquid Patribus doctiores, aut devotiores simus? To ascribe the prerogative of the Son to the Blessed Virgin, is not an honouring, but a dishonouring her: wherein the same holy Bernard appealeth to Antiquity, saying, Are wee ei∣ther more Learned, or more Devout than the Fathers? Your Iesuite answering to him by name, casteth him off with the Rest. Here wee see an Oath exacting a Consent to the Vnanimous Ex∣positions of Fathers, and heare notwithstanding as plaine a Dis∣sent of your Iesuites opposition unto Vnanimous Consent of Fa∣thers, which is the ordinary guise of your Disputers in their expounding of Scriptures: and yet behold you (forsooth) the
native children, and heires of the Doctrine of Ancient Fathers. Your Fathers of the Councel of Trent have set it downe for a Ca∣non, whereunto you are also sworne, that the words of Christ his Institution, concerning the giving of his Body and Blood, Booke 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 1. Have a plaine, and proper signification without Tropes: which notwithstanding, the same words of Christ have beene evinced to be Figurative, not onely by the Vnanimous Consent of Booke 2. Ch. 1. Sect. 6. and Chap. 2. Sect. 6. & 7. Antiquity, but also by the expresseBooke 2. Cha. 2. Sect. 4. See also B. 3. Ch. 3. in the words, [The fruit of the Vine.] Sect. 5. Confessions of your owne Iesuites, in the words [Eate, Breake, Cup, &c.] and wher∣in your selves have acknowledged divers Tropes. Besides, the whole former Treatise is but a displaying of your unconscio∣nable wresting of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers. Ponder you these Observations with your selves, and then judge whe∣ther your Swearing be not Perjury it selfe. IV. Overture of Perjury, in the Defenders of the Romish Masse, is in respect of the pretended Necessity of their Doctrine. IN the last Clause of the Oath, prescribed in the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth, you are sworne that every Article therein is theSee above in this Sect. 4. Initio, at the letter (a.) True Catholike Faith, without which none can be saved; a∣mong which is the Article already mentioned, swearing to whatsoever was declared in the Councel of Trent, by which Councel your now RomaneSynod. Tri∣dent. Sess. 15. Missall, or Masse-booke is ap∣proved. Now take a Taste of your Oath in every Epithet. First, [True:] and hereby are you sworne that in the dayes of Pope Innocentius the third, the Administration of the Eucharist to Infants was not held necessary; which your owne Authors haveBooke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 11. confessed, and proved to be false. Secondly, that the presence of them, who, at the administration of the Eucharist, do not communicate, isIbid. Sect. 5. & Sect. 10. Commendable, and held a Doctrine Ca∣tholike (that is) anciently Vniversall: which was generally con∣demned by Ancient Fathers; and, even in the Church of Rome it selfe, abandoned by twoBooke 1. Cha. 2. Sect. 9. Popes. Lastly, in the point of Necessity to salvation; To sweare that whosoever believeth not that one may be said toBooke 1. Cha. 2. Sect. 5. Communi∣cate alone, is damned; that whosoever believeth not that the Priest in the Masse, being alone, can duly say, The Lord be with you, hee is damned; or that theSee Booke 4. Body of Christ may not be run away with Mice, and be blowne away with the wind, hee is damned; and a number other like extreme foolish Crotchets, set downe in your Missals, which wee willingly omit. The Summe of all these is, that the same your Oath, made to damne
others, doth serve chiefly to make the Swearers themselves most damnable. If peradventure any of you shall oppose, saying that none of you within this Kingdome (which never admitted of the Councel of Trent, nor of the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth) are yet bound to that Oath, let him know that although this may excuse him from an Actuall Perjury, yet can it not free him from the Habituall, which is, that hee is disposed in himselfe to take it, whensoever it shall be offered unto him in any Kingdome, that doth imbrace and professe the same. Our last Advertisement followeth. Of the Mixture of many old Heresies with the former Defence of the Romish Masse. SECT. V. THe more odious the Title of this Section may seëme to be, the more studious ought you to shew your selves in exami∣ning the proofes thereof; that so you may either confute, or confesse them, and accordingly re-assume, or renounce your Romish Defence. Heresie hath a double aspect: One is when it is direct, having the expresse termes of Heresie; the Other is oblique, and by consequence, when the Defence doth inferre or imply necessa∣rily the same Hereticall Sense, even as it may be said of Trea∣son. For to say that Caesar is not King, is a Treasonable speech Directly, in a plaine Sense; and to say that Tribute money is not due to Caesar, is as Treasonable in the Consequence. Thus much being premised, wee are now to recognize such Errours, wher∣in your Disputers may seeme to have accordance with old He∣retikes, which point wee shall pursue according to the order of the Bookes. BOOKE I. Wherein your Church is found altering almost the whole forme of Christ his Institution, and the Custome of the Catholike Church, descended from the Apostles; which Presumption PopeBooke 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 3. Iulius condemned in divers, who sopped the Bread in the Chalice, and squeezed Grapes in the Cup, and so received them: even as did theIbid Artotyritae, in mingling Bread with Cheese, censured for Heretickes by your Aquinas. In which Comparison your Aberration from Christs example is so much greater than theirs, as you are found Guilty in defendingBooke 1. tho∣rowout. Ten Innovations, for one. 2. Your Pope Gelasius condemned the Hereticall Manichees, for thinking it lawfull not to receive the Cup in the Administra∣tion of the Eucharist, judging it to beBooke 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 7. Greatly Sacrilegious: notwithstanding yourIbid. Church authorizeth the same Cu∣stome
of forbidding the Administration of the Cup to fit Com∣municants. 3. AsBooke 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 10. you pretend Reverence, for withdrawing the Cup; so did theIbid. Sect. 10. Aquarij forbeare wine, and used onely Water, un∣der a pretence of Sobriety. 4. Sometime there may be a Reason to do a thing, when as yet there is no right, nor Authority for him that doth it. Wee therefore exact of you an Authority for altering the Apostles Customes, and Constitutions; and are answered thatBooke 1. Cha. 3. Sect. 4. your Church hath Authority over the Apostles Precepts. Iump with them, who being asked why they stood not unto the Apostles Traditions, replyed thatIbid. They were herein above the Apostles, whom therefore Irenaeus reckoneth among the Here∣tikes of his Time. BOOKE II. It is not nothing, which hath beene observed therein (to wit) your Reasoning, why you ought not to in∣terpret the words of Christ [This is my Body]Booke 2. Cha. 3. thorowout. literally; and why you urge his other Saying [Except you eate my flesh] Ibid. for proofe of Bodily Eating; so that your Priest may literally say in your Masse, that The Body of Christ passeth into your Bellies and Entrails, because (forsooth) the words of Christ areBooke 2. Cha. 3. Sect. 2. Doctrinall. And have you not heard of one Nicodemus, who hearing Christ teach that every man must beIoh. 3. Borne againe, who shall be partaker of Gods Kingdome; and that hee, expounding them in a Literall Sense, conceited a new Entrance into his Mothers wombe, when as nothing wanted to turne that his Errour into an Heresie, but onely Obstinacie? But of the strong and strange Obstinacies of your Disputers, you have received a full See above in this Booke, Chap. 2. Sect. 3. Synopsis. BOOKE III. After followeth your Article of Transubstan∣tiation. I. Your direct profession is indeed to believe no Body of Christ, but that which was Borne of the Virgin Ma∣ry. But this your Article of Transubstantiation of Bread into Christ's Body, generally held, according to the proper nature of Transubstantiation, to be byBooke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 2. Production of Christs Body out of the Substance of Bread, it necessarily inferreth a Body (called, and believed to be Christs) which is not Borne of the Blessed Virgin, as Saint Augustine hath plainlyBooke. 4. Ch. 4. Sect. 1. taught; diver∣sifying the Bodily thing on the Altar from the Body of Christ borne of the Virgin. Therefore your Defence symbolizeth with the Heresie of Apollinaris, who taught aBooke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 2 Body not Borne of the Virgin Mary. Secondly, You exclude all judgement ofBooke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 9. Senses, in discerning Bread to be truly Bread, as did theManichaei di∣cebant Christum non esse verum hominem, sed phantasma quod∣dam. Prteol. Elench. Haeret. Manichees in discerning Christ's Body, when hee was heere alive, which they thereupon held not to have beene a True, but
a Phantasticall Body. Tertullian also challengeth the Verity of Sense, in judging of Wine in the Eucharist, (after Con∣secration) in Confutation of the same Errour in the Mar∣cionites. Thirdly, for Defence of Christ his invisible Bodily Presence, you professe that (after Consecration) Bread is no more the same, but changed into the Body of Christ: which Doctrine in very expresse words was bolted out by an Eutychian Heretike, and instantly coudemned byBooke 3. Cha. 3. Sect. 12. Theodoret, and as fully abando∣ned by PopeIbid. Sect. 13. Gelasius. BOOKE IV. Catholike Fathers were in nothing more zea∣lous, than in defending the distinct properties of the two na∣tures of Christ his Deity, and Humanity, against the pernicious Heresies of the Manichees, Marcionites, Eutychians, and Euno∣mians; all of them diversly oppugning the Integrity of Christ's Body, sometime in direct termes, and sometime by irrefragra∣ble Consequences; whether it were by gaine-saying the Fi∣nitenesse, or Solidity, or else the compleat Perfection there∣of: wherein how farre yee may challenge affinity or kin∣dred with them, be you pleased to examine by this which followeth. I. The Heretikes, who undermined the property of Christ's Bodily Finitenesse, said that it was in divers places at once, (as isBook 4. Chap. 4. Sect. . & Chap. . Sect. 3. & Chap. 6. Sect. 1. confessed) even as your Church doth now attribute unto the same Body of Christ, both in Heaven, and in Earth, yea, and in Millions of distant Altars at the same time; and conse∣quently in all places whatsoever. Now whether this Doctrine of Christ's Bodily Presence in many places at once was held of the Catholike Fathers for Hereticall, it may best be seene by their Doctrine of the Existence of Christ's Body in one onely place; not onely Definitively, but also Circumscriptively: both which do teach an absolute Impossibility of the Existence of the same in divers places at once. And they were as zealous in professing the Article of the maner of Christs Bodily Being in place, as they are in instructing men of the Article of Christ's Bodily Being, lest that the deniall of its Bodily maner of being might de∣stroy the nature of his Body. {fleur-de-lys} So farre, that the Ancient Father VigiliusVigilius. B. 4. C. 5. §. 5. testifieth, that to believe The Body of Christ, wheresoever it was, to be Circumscribed in one place, was the Ancient Catholike Doctrine of those Ages. {fleur-de-lys} To which end they have concluded it to be absolutely but in one place, sometime in aChap. 4 tho∣rowout. Circumscriptive Finitenesse, thereby di∣stinguishing them from all created Spirits; and sometime by a Definitive Termination, which they set downe first by Exem∣plications, thus:Ibid. Sect. . If Christ his Body be on Earth, then it is ab∣sent from Heaven; and thus, Being in the Sunne, it could not be in the Moone: Secondly, by divers Comparisons, for compa∣ring
the Creature with the Creator God, theyIbid. conclude, that The Creature is not God, because it is determinated in one place; and comparing the humane, and divine Nature of Christ together, theyCha. 4. Sect. . conclude, that they are herein different, because the hu∣mane and Bodily Nature of Christ is necessarily included in one place: and lastly comparing Creatures with the Holy Ghost, they Cha. . Sect  conclude a difference by the same Argument, because the Holy Ghost is in many places at once; and all these in confutation of divers Heretikes. A thing so well knowne to your elder Ro∣mish Schoole, that it confessed the Doctrine of Existence of a Body in divers places at once (in the judgement of Antiquity) to beIbid. Hereticall. {fleur-de-lys} Yea and so Hereticall, that it openeth a Sluce for the old raucid Heresie of the Ariomanitae, (by inter∣pretation, Maddish-Arians) to low in upon us, who denied the Holy Ghost to be God, as not being every where; whom the Primitive Fathers did Confute, (See B. 4. C. 7. §. 2. Seven in num∣ber) by proving the Holy Ghost to be every where, and therefore God, because Hee is in divers places at once. Which was likewiseB. 4. . 6. §. 3. Tertullians Argument, to prove the Godhead of Christ. II. The property of a Solidity likewise was patronized by Ancient Fathers, in confutation of Heretikes, by teaching Chap. 7. Sect. 6. Christs Body to be necessarily Palpable, against their Im∣palpabilitie; and to have a Thicknesse, against their feigned subtile Body, as the Aire. {fleur-de-lys} A wholeBooke 4. c. 8. §. ▪ Generall Councel of Ephesus determining that The Body of Christ is palpable where∣soever it is: {fleur-de-lys} and furthermore controlling these opinions following (which are also your Crotchets) of a BodiesCha. 7.

III The property of Perfection of the Body of Christ, wheresoever, in the highest Degree of Absolutenesse. This (one would thinke) every Christian heart should assent unto, at the first hearing; wherefore if that they were judged Here∣tickes by Ancient Fathers, whoPrateol. E∣lench. haeres. Tit. Phi∣loponus Alexandri∣nus. Statuit mortuo∣rum resurrectionem esse, viz. rationalium animarum cum cor∣ruptibili corpore in∣dissolubilem unio∣nem. taught an Indivisible Vni∣on of mens soules with their Bodies naturally, still subject to cor∣ruption after the resurrection; who can imagine that the holy Catholicke Fathers would otherwise have judged of this your generall Tenet, (viz. to beleeve a Body of Christ, now since his Glorification, which is destitute of all power of naturall moti∣on, sense, appetite, or understanding) otherwise than of a sense∣lesse, and Antichristian Deliration, and Delusion? {fleur-de-lys} Fie, no! for they believed no Body of Christ, after his Resurre∣ction, but such as isBooke 4. Cha. 9. §. 3. void of all infirmity, and in all integrity most perfect. {fleur-de-lys} Yea and that which is your onely Reason
you allege, to avoid our Objection of Impossibilities in such cases, (to wit)Booke 4. Ch. 5. Sect. . The Omnipotencie of God, the same was the Pretence of Heretikes of old, in the like Assertions; which occasioned the Ancient Fathers to terme the Pretence of Omnipotencie,Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. The Sanctuary of Heretikes: albeit the same Heretikes, (as well as you) intended (as a Father spea∣keth) to magnifie God thereby; namely, inbeleeving the Body of Christ, after his Ascension, to be wholly Spirituall. To which Heretikes the same Father readily answered, (as wee may to you) saying,Chap. 4. Sect. . at (b & c.) When you will so magnifie Christ, you do but accuse him of falshood: not that wee do any whit de∣tract from the Omnipotencie of Christ, (farre be this Spirit of Blasphemy from us!) but that (as you have beene instructed by Ancient Fathers) the attributing an Impossibility to God, in such Cases of Contradiction, is not a diminishing, but an ample advancing of theIbid.
