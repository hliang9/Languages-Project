THE PREFACE. I Do not question but the Reader will expect somewhat should be premised, by way of Satisfaction, to such Scru∣ples as may be suggested in general, concerning the Authentickness of the en∣suing Letters; which, as I conceive, they are reducible to the following heads, viz. An Account of the Author, and the Means whereby he got his Intelligence; the Verity of the Matters related; the Nature of the Correspondence; and what part the Methodizer has had in the Un∣dertaking; so I shall endeavour to give as distinct and satisfactory a Solution of each Particular, as may reasonably be expected from me, or the Circumstance of the Things will justly admit of.
First then for the Author, and his In∣telligence: The first time he went over into France was in the Year 1675, where he had not stay'd above a Year, but that the place of General Commis, or Clark of the Dispatches, and Particular Com∣mis Interpreter to that great French Minister of State, the Marquess de Louvois, for the Affairs relating to our Three Kingdoms, falling vacant by the Death of one Mr. Kilpatrick, a Scotchman's Son, that same Imployment was conferred by him upon a French∣man, a Favourite of his, named Belou; Who understanding no English, and there∣fore not being able to manage the Af∣fair without an English Man, our Au∣thor was recommended to him for that service (as he hints in his first Letter) which yet you are to Note by the way, was not the first he writ from that Coun∣try, to that Noble Person he correspon∣ded with, and to whom he was previ∣ously engaged to transmit all the Intel∣ligence he could learn of the Proceed∣ings of the French Court, before he en∣tred upon the said Imployment, (but they being not very material, he took
no care to reserve the Transcripts by him) and continued to be Interpreter of the English tongue till after the time of our Grand Revolution, when he came over into England; where his stay was not long, but that he was imployed by the same Noble Person to return into France again, where the dangerous part he was to Act may be better conceived than now exprest, but concerning which you may hear more hereafter. Its no hard matter to imagine what Qualifications were necessary to recom∣mend our Author to the Imployment a∣fore noted, and how far his out-side must differ from his in-side during his aboad there, which together with that part which he has Acted in that Kingdom, since his present Majesty King William's Accession to the Throne, and that he knows not how soon he may still be en∣gaged to return (though he be at pre∣sent in London) are Reasons of them∣selves, without superadding any other, of the many that might be produced, more than sufficient for the suppression of his Name, and of my being engaged in the Work; which yet rather than Truth
should suffer, I am satisfied he will be as forward to render, as well known to the World, as 'tis to that Noble Person who has imployed him. I am of Opinion, the Reader will be much better perswaded of the verity of the Facts, as well as much more pleased with the new Discoveries of State-Mysteries he will meet with here, by the perusal of the Work himself, than by any thing I can pretend to say in the Defence of the one, or the Com∣mendations of the other; And were it not to obviate a vulgar Error and Ob∣jection that I foresee would be made upon this Subject, That all that could be Writ has been written already, concerning the late Reigns, I should dismiss it; But now I am necessitated not to single out, but promiscuously to call to mind a few Heads (for to make an Enumeration of all the remark∣able Particulars were to run through the Contents of every individual Let∣ter) and to ask the Objector, where it is he meets with an exact Account of the Private League between King Charles the Second, and the French
King; The Duke of York's secret Cor∣respondence with that Court; Cole∣man's interventien with both for his own Advantage; The Interest the French made both in England and Holland among the several Sects and Parties of Men, to prevent the late Queen's being married to his present Majesty: The Methods concerted to Trapan her into France with her Father's concurrence, and how prevented; Father St. Ger∣main's attempting King Charles the Se∣cond in his Religion, with the King's Answer, &c. His unseasonable boasting of it, the Occasion of his flight into France, and the Censure he underwent from those of his Order for it; Coleman's Wife's Petition to the French King, the Answer, and her destroying her self; Monsieur le Tellier's Speech about the Invasion of England; the Duke of York his pervertion to the Church of Rome; King James his Private League with France, when Regnant; the Essay made by Don Ronquillo, the Spanish Ambassador, to draw him into the Austrian Interest, with his Answer, and Refusal, in savour of France; How Father Petre came to be made a Privy
Councellor; wherefore Mr. Skelton was imprisoned in the Tower, &c. which, to name no more, though the rest are of e∣qual curiosity, as they had, in all like∣lihood, been for ever buried in the pro∣foundest Oblivion, had not the Fate and Address of this Gentleman led him to fetch them out of the Dark, and almost inscrutable Recesses of the French Cabi∣net-minutes, so the Reader will find they carry so much Evidence of Truth with them, not only by the Connexion they have with many material Passages in Sir William Temple's Memoirs, Mr. Coke's Detection of the Court and State of England during the Four last Reigns, &c. but by so natural an unfol∣ding of what is obscurely, or but tran∣siently hinted at by those learned Au∣thors, who could not see beyond their light; and yet so remote from those Scurru∣lities, as well as Inconsistencies, to say no worse, which occur in some other pie∣ces of the same Reigns, that it were a Crime to make any farther Apology for them: Yet it may be noted by the way, that this same doth evince the necessity of this Supplemental Part, as well for the detecting of past Falsities, as for the
perfecting of past Discoveries: And 'tis hoped no body will quarrel, that this Piece which is Entituled by the Name of a Secret History, &c. should be writ∣ten in an Epistolary way, when it be considered that such a Form was indis∣pensibly necessary under the Circumstan∣ces of the Author, and his Noble Cor∣respondent, and that there is a very engaging part naturally couched under such a method of bringing State-Arca∣na's to light, by way of Letters, which, in the very Notion of them carry something of secrecy; Though after all, the Rea∣der cannot but observe an Air of History to run, in a manner, through the whole composition; but whether arising from the Mode of those Minutes from whence our Author drew his Intelligence, or from his own natural Genius, or partly from both, is, I confess a Question I never asked him, neither do I think the de∣termination of it of any great consider∣ation. As to the nature and manner how this Correspondence was managed, the Inqui∣rer may take notice that the conveyance was not so difficult; For the Post, during
all the time these Letters were continu∣ed, was free between both Nations, though he is also to observe, that some of them occasionally for fear of interception were written in Cyphers, which I retain by me, as I do the rest of the Original Pa∣pers, for my own and the Worlds satis∣faction: But for the method pursued by him, during the present Reign, It will then be time enough to give such hints thereof as in prudence shall be esteemed safe and necessary. But though the Station this learned Gentleman was in, did, together with his own industry and curiosity, entitle him to the vast Discoveries made in these Letters; Yet the ticklishness of his Cir∣cumstances, and the fears of being sur∣prized, together with a natural tendency that is in Mankind, to take notice of present rather than past Occurrencies, would not admit of a continued succession of writing Matters of Fact as they have fallen out in order of time; Which as it is a most convincing Reason of so many inverted and promiscuous Dates, so it has introduced the Methodizer: First, under a necessity of frequently altering the
prefatory and conclusive parts of the Let∣ters, and then of making up some small breaches, which under the fore∣mentioned Circumstances must necessarily happen, and which yet are grounded upon the most irrefragable Authorities, that there might be a connection between the several Parts, and the History appear entire, and all of a piece. And it could not be thought ungrateful to our Reader to have the Contents inserted before every Letter, with the Observation of the Years, so far as was needful, when each Matter was transacted, whereof there neither was a necessity for the Author to observe to that Noble Lord to whom he was the Intelligencer, who is too great a Critick in History to need it, unless it were upon some very special occasions; neither indeed would the promiscuous way of Writing, which the stinted Opportu∣nities, he was under, forced to him, admit well of it; especially when these Papers at the first taking of them were not designed to be made publick. Though his own Curto∣sity led him to keep Copies of what∣ever he writ that was material, then which nothing is more common with Per∣sons under the like Circumstances; The
many Letters and Memoirs that have from time to time appeared in the World, being a convincing proof hereof; And without which Method it had been im∣possible to have transmitted to Posterity the thousandth part of what the World has been obliged with, in things of that kind. Its true there are some Letters to be met with now and then in the course of this Correspondence, which, at first sight, may seem to be foreign, and have little or no relation to the main Subject; But besides that there are few or none with∣out some sort of connexion, and do not in one degree or other interfere with the British Affairs, they are so much an im∣bellishment to those parts they fill up, as not to merit so severe a Censure, as to undergo the fate of being castrated. And here is a spacious field before me, were it adviseable, or any ways ne∣cessary, to descant upon the excellency and usefullness of these Discoveries which are wholly new; But I shall wave that, and only observe; That there is no one Party, or sect of Men in England, much
less the Court exempted, but may draw very seasonable Informations, and no less timous Instructions herefrom, see∣ing they have all of them, in their re∣spective turns, though many quite against their knowledge, been imposed upon by French Emissaries, and made Tools of to serve the Interest of France, to the prejudice of themselves, and of their own Country; And how far the same Emissaries, though under different shapes, according to time and occasion, have prevailed to nourish and perpetuate those Intestine Feuds, and Cruel Animosities which they formerly sowed amongst us, during the present Reign, will in part, among other surpriing Secrets, be the subject matter of the next Volume, which will be continued down to the present year 1696, and which I could not forbear mentioning upon this occasion, though it comes in by way of Anticipation. D. Jones. From my House in Clerkenwell, Nov. 9th. 1696.
LETTER I. Of the Author's being introduced to the Place of Interpreter of the English Tongue, &c. My Lord, I Am not so pleased with my Preferment of being made Interpreter for the English Affairs, to the Principal Commis or Clark of the Dispatches under the Marquess De Louvois, to which Employment I have been lately admitted, as I am with the Thoughts of the Opportunity I shall have to serve your Lordship, with much better Intelligence than hitherto my Circumstances would admit of; most of my time, since my admission into the aid Office, has been taken up in inspecting into Mr. Kil-Patrick's Method, who was Pre∣decessor to the Person to whom I am Inter∣preter, and I have under my Hands all his Papers and Minutes for near Twenty Years backward; whereby I do not question, but I may in time give your Honour much light in∣to the Intrigues of the Ministers of State in this Kingdom, and the Maxims they have and do go upon, for the producing such Ac∣cidents and Revolutions in their Neighbour-Nations,
and especially in our Kingdoms, as may favour the Aspiring Endeavours of this Court towards an Universal Monarchy, and obviate all such cross Events as may fall out contrary to their Designs; I have seen some strange things already, in relation to our Country, Contrived and Agitated by them, but my Business requires so much At∣tendance from me at present, and the minu∣ting out of any thing but what belongs to the Service of the Office, requires so much Cir∣cumspection and Privacy, that I durst not hitherto venture upon any such thing; but I hope a little time will put me into a free∣dom of Circumstance, that may in some mea∣sure be answerable to my readiness to serve you, and make appear how much I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble Servant. Paris, Ian. 8. 1676. N. St.
LETTER II. Of the Opposition made by the French Mi∣nisters of State to K. Charles IId's Re∣storation, with their Answers to the Queen-Mother's Resentments thereupon. My Lord, ACcording to the Expectation I may have raised in your Lordship by my last, of some Notable Intelligence from me, I am to acquaint you with what perhaps you will hardly believe; that this Court, consi∣dering the near Alliance between the Bur∣bonian and English Royal Family, should as much as once think to obstruct the King's Restauration to the Throne of his Ancestors: but for my part, I clearly find there is nei∣ther Father, Brother, nor Cousin, between Kings and Kingdoms, and that France used the utmost of her Policy, at that time, to keep us Embroiled at Home, while she might have her Hands loose to play her Game A∣broad; but because I conceive it may not be ungrateful to your Lordship, to understand what those Stratagems were, which they own themselves to have practised upon that Occasion, I shall briefly hint them unto you, as I find them entred here in their Cabinet-Minutes;
Monsieur Bourdeax was then their Ordinary Embassador at London, whose In∣structions were, both by himself and several other Emissaries which they had there, to raise all the Jealousies imaginable in the se∣veral Factions of Monk and his Adherents, and at the same time to make Overtures to Monk, to assume Oliver's Post and Power; urging with great vehemency that he might with much more Justice and Security do it, as having (what the other had not) a Presi∣dent before him; but tho' that General re∣fused the Proposal, and was proof against all their Attacks of that kind, saying, he would not split his Family upon that Rock against which the Cromwell's had dasht, but would wave all Ambitious Projects of his own Gran∣dure, that were indirect, and pursue only those that consisted with his Countreys good; and that they saw at last it was in vain to at∣tempt the Union of the stronger Factions at Home, either against Monk, or the King's Restoration; they resolved to try what might be done Abroad to work them into a Temper, and therefore to raise Jealousies in them from their Neighbours, they did in March 1660. Defile several Battalions of Foot towards Calais, giving out at the same time, that their Design was to Besiege Dun∣kirk in Conjunction with the Spanish Forces; and that after the Place was taken by them, it was to be delivered up to the Spaniards,
pursuant to an Agreement made between them, that the latter had consented to give up Cambray, and some other Places, to the French in lieu of it; at which proceedings of theirs, the Queen-Mother then in France taking the Alarm, she briskly remonstrated unto them the unnatural part they acted, considering the near Ties of Blood in her Person between the Royal Families of France and England, and how dishonourable it was to oppose the Restitution of a Prince, which they were bound to promote even by Arms, tho' he had been no ways Allied to them: but she was answered, that there were ma∣ny Reasons of state which superceded all those Scruples; that for her part, she might be assured, she should be as well provided for as otherwise; that it was not safe for her Son to be brought in purely by his own Subjects; but that if they both would have a little patience, they did not question but they had taken such Methods so to embroil and weaken England, that there would be quick∣ly room enough for the French King to bring him in, in a much more Glorious manner, so as that he might be Absolute Master of his Subjects, and have his Royal Authority no more to depend upon the fickle and change∣able Temper of a Perfidious Nation, nor be in danger to receive any check from Parlia∣ments, that would sooner or latter prove Fa∣ctious and Dangerous to his State; that it
was visible the Spaniards had a great hand in promoting such a Revolution in England, and therefore they desired her to consider how dishonourable it would be to the House of Bourbon to suffer it; and how dangerous such a Conjunction of England and Spain (which would naturally follow) against them would be, she her self might judge; and that therefore since a little patience would Infallibly retrieve the whole Game to their Interest, and much more to her Satis∣faction, they could do no less than pursue the Methods they had taken, and make both her and her Son happy, tho' it were against their Wills; that she was much in the wrong to judge of Things by present Appearances, that they were assured, however Matters might be concealed from her, the Conditi∣ons proposed to the King her Son by his Sub∣jects, were little to her Satisfaction, when they imported no less, than that her two younger Sons (of the Elder of whom she had conceived greatest Hopes) and her self, must never set footing on English Ground, and that the King himself must Marry a Pro∣testant Heretick, and suffer no Roman Ca∣tholick to live in his Dominions. But when they found all their Politicks had failed them, and that the King was restored in spight of them, according to his Hearts Content, they afterwards fell upon other Stratagems, put in due time in Execution to work upon his
Easie Nature, and to render his Power more serviceable than hurtful to their Designs, tho' the King, (who was yet sensible of the Injuries done him) upon his Arrival in Eng∣land ordered Bourdeux to withdraw out of his Dominions; this is the substance of what I find entred here, in reference to this parti∣cular, and all I have now to Communicate, which, if I find it relish with your Lordship, I shall not fail to lay hold of all Occasions to demonstrate how much I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble, &c. Paris, Feb. 19. 1676. N. St. LETTER III. Of several Matches proposed to King Charles the Second, by the French Court, with his Answers and Rejection of the same. My Lord, IT's not unknown to your Lordship, that one Topick in the French Politicks has been now for many Years, to bring their Neighbour Princes into their Interests, by procuring them Wives; and the French Wo∣men
have had an Excellent Faculty to bring over their Husbands into the Gallican Noose, tho' apparently to the hazard of themselves, and their own State; so that quite failing in their end to obstruct the King's Restoration, they now attempted to Entrap him with a Wife; I understand there were several French Matches proposed to him during his Exile, and among others a great Lady, whose Name I cannot now remember, who had like to have been afterward Married to the Prince of Conde, and whom the King hotly Courted when in France; but because he was refused by her then, he in his turn refused her when Restored; tho' in reality such a proffer on their part, was no more than to sound his Disposition towards Marrying a French Wo∣man in general; for if he had consented to have taken this Lady to Wife, the French Court would not have suffered it, because she was a Martial Lady, and of the contrary Faction to them at Paris: A second was their then Madamoisell D' Orleans, the French King's Aunt, which Match agreed very well both with her and King Charles's Inclination; and the King seemed forward to press it; but it was not so with the French Court, who by their Artifices put it by, as remembring likewise her Martial Temper, and what she had done, when with her own Hands she had fired off the Guns of the Bastile against the King's Party in the Wars of Paris, and
how hotly she abetted the Party that stood up against the King's Legitimacy; for they looked upon her still with a Jealous Eye, as thinking her yet full of Resentment, and that she would put our King in a Martial Mood, cause him to renew the Old Pretensi∣ons to France, and to abet the Princes that might have been disposed to renew the Dis∣pute of the French King's Illegitimacy, and to advance their own Title to that Crown; or at least-wise, that she would put King Charles upon thwarting in all things, what∣ever might promote the Grandure of Lewis XIVth. Nay, so great was their Fear of that Ladies Issue, by any Person whatsoever, that after they had Treacherously sham'd her into a Clandestine Match with the Count D' Lauzun, to hinder her Matching with a∣ny greater Person; they likewise took Care she should have no Issue, even by him, by keeping of him in Prison, and never suffer∣ing them to come together again till they were both past Children: The third Person I find proposed, and that in Earnest, was Cardinal Mazarine's Niece Hortensia, a Match of which the French Court were very fond, and such as was every way agreeable to their Gusto: the Cardinal, besides many other So∣phistical Addresses to bring the Business to bear, got the Hook baited with the Ap∣pearance of a great stock of Beauty, besides the tender of a vast Sum of Money to boot:
He took Care also to have it rumoured a∣broad, that such a Match was not only in agitation, but in a fair way to be accom∣plished, all which 'twas believed might have done the Feat, but that it having been unluc∣kily rumoured abroad, that she had paid her first Fruits already to the French King, K. C. said, He would not be content with her upon the second hand: However it were, the Reasons transmitted to the French Court, why such an Advantageous Offer was rejected by our King, were, 1. Because her Unkle had so ungenerously opposed his Restoration, and used him so Contemptuously at the Treaty of the Pyrenees. 2. Because that Alliance could be of no Advantage to him, but by a little present Money, and would besides raise Jealousies in his People against him, for which the Day was yet too early; so that seeing they found they could put no French Lady upon him, they resolved to promote the Match with Portugal, whereby, they were sure, the King would have no Issue: But that was not all, for by this means, they were in hopes to ren∣der him destitute of any Powerful Forreign Ally; and that the Duke of York being al∣ready Married to Chancellor Hide's Daugh∣ter, and in Prospect of a fair Issue, both them Matches might together lay a Founda∣tion
for New Discontents, weaken the U∣nion between King and People, and put the Younger Brother upon Aspiring Thoughts, in Prejudice to the Elder. But because the foresaid Match with Portugal might not be thought to be of their Contrivance, and for some self-ends, they put this piece of drud∣gery upon the Queen-Mother, whom they managed so as to give her assured Hopes, her second Son, who was her Darling, would by that means one Day ascend the English Throne, and what might not she and all of them hope from him, who had ever been much more open in Profession of, and Zea∣lous for the Roman Religion? &c. But great Care was taken to give it out betimes, that this Journey of the Queen was only a Visit to her Son, now a King de facto, and in all Royal State, and that she designed quickly to return and spend the remainder of her Days in France, her Native Country; and at the same time how highly she was offended at her other Son, the Duke of York's Marri∣age with the Chancellor's Daughter, which about that Conjuncture came to be publickly known, and by whom he had now a Child Born; but whether she had any Instructions upon this Journey to break the Ice, and make Overtures to her Son about the Sale of Dunkirk, I could never learn, and our Mi∣nutes are in a profound silence concerning it; however I shall in my next give you all the
Intimations that ever came within the verge of my Knowledge upon this Head, and in the mean time, am, My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble Servant. Paris, Feb. 25. 1676. N. St. LETTER IV. Of the Sale of Dunkirk to the French, and by what Methods effected. My Lord, THat Cardinal Richlieu had ong before laid a Foundation for the French great∣ness, and even to nourish Thoughts of France's attaining in Time the universal Mo∣narchy, is notoriously known to all that are conversant in the Histories of his Time; and that Cardinal Mazarine, who succeeded him as Primier Minister of State, pursued his Steps, and made considerable Advances in the Design before he Dyed, which was a∣bout the Time of the Negotiation for the Sale of Dunkirk, is no less manifest; and that the Methods both the one and the other pursued, was to set their Engines on work
continually to embroil their Neighbours, ei∣ther in Intestine Jarrs, or in an open Invasi∣on of one anothers Territories, and then to invite themselves in to assist the weaker, that they might run away with the Prey from both; but among all their Neighbour Nati∣ons, the English were those they most dread∣ed, both out of Fear and Emulation of their Military Strength and Glory, and whom consequently they made their utmost Efforts to entangle in Civil Discords; and therefore it was that Richlieu took Advantage of the unhappy Conjuncture in the first sowing the Seeds of Discontent between King Charles I. and his Parliaments: And then by his Incen∣diaries kindled such a flame in the Three Kingdoms, as terminated not only in the Destruction of the King, but even of the Monarchy it self; so that the Nation after having undergone a Succession of almost all the Forms of Government, that have been in use among the Sons of Men run at last into the very Dregs of all Government, even Anarchy it self; which Mazarine did as streuosly en∣deavour to keep up amongst us, as his Pre∣decessor Richlieu had been forward to run us upon those dangerous Precipices that intro∣duced it; but when after all, the French Efforts to prevent our return to our Old and known Form again, by the Kings Restoration had failed; it struck no small damp upon the French Polititians, to see the Babel they had
been so long Erecting, and were now in a fair way to have laid on the Top-stone, in danger to be overthrown at one Clap, and to have all their Hopes dashed to pieces; and therefore they stood still for a Time to see what so mighty a Revolution in England might produce, and what mighty things a King in the Vigour of his Years (whom they had sufficiently provoked during his Exile) so high in the Love of his Subjects, the ancient Emulators of the French, and the People now in the most Martial Posture that ever they were in since England was a Nati∣on, would undertake; but finding all were Haleyon Das, and that then there was no apparent Disposition in our Court to make any Incroachment on their Neighbours; the French Ministers began to re-assume fresh Hopes, and to consider what Expedients might be proper for to promote their De∣signs, which now for some time had lain Dormant; one Project was that of the Match mentioned by me to your Lordship in my Last, which succeeding so well, and finding still that the King was far enough from de∣signing any War for the enlargment of his Territories, they resolved to make an Essay, and see whether he was willing to part with any thing that was already his own. I do suppose your Lordship may have heard of Cardinal de Retz being in disgrace at the French Court, of his being forced to
flee the Kingdom, of his being at London incognito some time after the Restoration; what he was publickly accused for in France, was that he had favoured the Adverse Party about the Point of the Legitimacy, that he had invited Madamoisell d' Orleans to aspire to a Match with our King, and Abetted the Pre∣tensions of Rome against those of the Court, about the then growing Difficulties concern∣ing the Regale; but what ever the Reasons were, they were never Published, nor suffer∣ed to be so much as entred in the Minutes of other Secrets; but this is certain, that our King interceded with the French King on his behalf, and that he was admitted to return, and I have been assured, it was by the way of Dunkirk, and was sent afterward Embassa∣dor to Rome; but whether all this was a Jug∣gle, to carry on a Negotiation about Dun∣kirk, I will not positively affirm, but it looks as much like a French Trick, as one Egg does another. That the Spaniards pressed our King very early for the Restitution of Dunkirk, is un∣controulably true, and made pretty large offers, and it is as true that the King rejected their Proposals, which yet did not discou∣rage the French Emissaries, of whom they had by this Time many in England, as the Minutes shew, who having ingratiated them∣selves with the Chancellor, and other hungry Courtiers made also their Overtures; and
told the King withal, that Cromwel was to have that Town only for a Temporary Cau∣tion, for so much Money due to him for his Assistance against the Spaniards, and that therefore it was a Matter of Right they insi∣sted upon seeing they were now ready to lay down the Summ, with more then Inte∣rest, nay, and they were so bold as to tell him farther, that if he refused to give it for Money, they would endeavour to recover the same by a War, and questioned not the Junction of the Hollanders with them, both by Sea and Land in that Case; they being as unwilling as the French, that the English should have footing so near them on the Con∣tinent, and in effect they made use of the Dutch Faction, and some Jews their Emissa∣ries in England, more then any Body else to bring that Affair about; and because they would be sure to meet with no Obstru∣ctions from the Spaniards, by renewing their Instances to the King, and alleadging a greater right to the Town then the French, they amused them with a Design they had to restore it to them again, upon a reasonable equivalent in Flanders, and gave it out that they had entred into a Treaty already with them upon that Head; but whether it was so in Reality I cannot tell, and this is all that I am able to inform your Lordship concerning our parting with that Impor∣tant Place; Only that the summ paid for it
was two Millions, and five hundred thou∣sand Lirves, and so I remain My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble Servant. Paris, March 4. 1676. N. St. LETTER V. Overtures made to King Charles II. for the Sale of Tangier to the French, and how prevented. My Lord, THe French having (as I have given your Lordship an Account in my Last) gained their Point in the buying of Dunkirk, whereof the French Forces took Possession a∣bout October in the Year, 1662. they pau∣sed a little to see how the English would re∣sent it before they would make any further Paces for the Promotion of their Cause to our Disadvantage; but finding the Memory of the Anarchical Times, together with the Nation's, according the Example of the Court, daily degenerating from the Severity of Manners in Former Times, had in a man∣ner laid them fast asleep, and quite oblitera∣ted
all Thoughts of Military Glory, so far as if there had been a sudden Transmutation of the Genius of the People, they resolved to make another Essay upon the easie temper of the King, and try whether he would also part with Tangier unto them; but whether it were that the King was sensible already of his Mistake in parting with Dun∣kirk, or that this very Motion of theirs put him upon considering what he had done, and the great Error he had committed in Poli∣cy thereby, it is certain he gave them an ab∣solute Denial; and that their Minutes speak, but say withal that to be revenged of his De∣nial, and make him odious after their usual Manner; this Court ordered it however to be reported as if he had been willing for it; and further add, that the Kings real An∣swer was, that Tangier being his Queens Dowry, to whom he had not long been Married; it would not at all suit with his Honour to sell it, neither could he well part with it, unless he parted with Her; that it was by Parliament annext to the Imperial Crown of England, and so could not be Sold without them; that if both He and his Par∣liament too might be willing to sell it at ano∣ther Time; yet to be sure, it was not pro∣per to think of it just then, when after so much Treasure and Blood spent upon it al∣ready, it might if ever, prove of some use to the Nation, in the War then like to be∣gin
with the Dutch: that he could not part with it to the French King so well as to any other Christian Prince, nay not so well as even to the Moors themselves, without giving a very just and therefore a dangerous Cause of Jealousie to his People, especially in that Juncture, when by the Carriage of the French he had great Cause to suspect, they were Jealous of his grandeur at Sea; and would joyn with the Dutch against him: which re∣fusal of his, I must tell your Lordship, was indeed one of the secret Causes among others why they soon after actually joyned with that Nation, to diminish our Power, to sham them, and weaken and undermine us both, as well as to hatch up a Navy of their own; and since I am entred upon this Sub∣ject; your Lordship will pardon me, if I proceed a little further, and acquaint you; that they did afterwards renew their Instan∣ces about the Sale of the said Place, with much more earnestness then before, and that at a Time when their Interest was much stronger, and more prevalent at our Court; and yet even then, tho' the Parliament had denied him the supplies which he demanded extraordinary, as your Lordship well knows, to be appropriated for the maintenance of Tangier, and that he was in great streights for Money, he would not sell it to the French, nor restore it to Portugal; but chose rather to demolish it, and abandon it to
the Moors; why he would not sell it to the French, I have already given the Reasons, but there was perhaps another more preva∣lent Argument for it; viz. the strong Vote of the House of Commons to that Purpose, which your Lordship knows better then I can pretend to inform you; to which perhaps I may subjoyn another in due place, and there∣fore now can only subscribe my self My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble Servant. Paris, Octob. 24. 1684. N. St. LETTER VI. Of the first Dutch War, begun in 1664, My Lord, I Have no Reason to doubt, but your Lord∣ship knows most of the Particulars re∣lating to that unhappy War begun between England and Holland in the Year, 1665. but it may, it will not be unpleasing to recount what the French designs might be in it, how they promoted it, and what Advantages they drew from it; which I shall do very
briefly; when they found our King did not lay hold of those Advantages put into his Hands upon his Restoration to render him∣self great at home and formidable abroad, and made not the least meen of a Martial, Designing and Ambitious Humour, they made it their first business by their Instru∣men's at our Court, to hinder his closing with Spain, or any other in the Interest of the House of Austria, by making up the Por∣tugal Match, as I have already hinted to your Lordship; next by gaining the Duke of York timely over to their Devotion, and then by other Emissaries and Pentioners, whereof they had good store, both in Eng∣land and Holland, to stir up such Disputes between the two Nations as might end in a War, and so divert the first Essays of the Power of our new Monarch from themselves: In this how admirably they succeeded, is well known, the Dutch on the one side being se∣cretly incited and encouraged to Insolencies and Encroachments, and the English to as deep Resentments; insomuch that a War was hotly urged against them by our Par∣liament it self; the French Court in the mean time playing Bopeep with them both; for it does manifestly appear by the hints that I have seen, that they promised Succour to both Parties in Case of a Rupture, though it were really resolved to see us fight first, and then succour the weakest, and so
kill two Birds with one Stone, that is, di∣vert and weaken both our Naval Forces, and make use of one of us to increase their own Naval Strength, till which War was very inconsiderable; which they most effectually did, for they no sooner saw the Ballance in∣cline to our side by the first great defeat gi∣ven the Hollanders in that War, but contra∣ry to all the Assurances before given to the King, they not only sided with the Enemy; but drew the Dane too into their Confederacy, tho' they never did either of them any good by fighting for them at Sea, but only by bri∣bing one at that Time in the highest Favour in our Court; I need not Name him, got a part of our Fleet, sent on a blind Errand after theirs, where 'twas sure not to be found, while the Dutch and the rest of our Ships and Commanders, were left to batter one another to pieces to make them sport; having gained their Ends in this Point, they proceeded and gained also another of yet more dangerous Consequence, and that was to get the unthinking Hogens to build them most of the best Ships, they now pos∣sess, and with which they have since scour∣ged the Dutch both before Palermo and o∣therParts, and with which they have pretend∣ed since to Match either them or us; this ap∣pears, my Lord, by the Minutes of the Lists we have of their Navy, whereof some Co∣pies were Printed, but at present I cannot help
your Lordship to one; but therein were ex∣prest the Dates and Places of the building of every Ship, whereof of near an 160 Men of War of all sorts, near an 100 of them were built in the Ports of Holland, in the Time of the said War; during which Time also they bought such quantities of Gun-powder, Salt-Petre, and all sorts of Warlike materi∣als there, as so strengthned them, and ex∣hausted the other, who ne'er dreamt they intended in a little Time to carry the War to them, that it much facilitated the success they had afterward in Invading that Country, that War ended with all the success to their Designs they could desire, both by the Treacherous Compliance of Corrupt Mini∣sters, they had gained in both Nations, and the Discouragement the English had recei∣ved, by the perfidious falling off of the Bi∣shop of Munster from us, Junction of the Dane against us, and the Chatham disaster in having our Ships burnt there; which they effected by procuring the Queen-Mother to write a Letter to her Son, that she was as∣sured the Dutch would have no Fleet out that Summer; I need not remonstrate to your Lordship our ill Conduct herein, I am sure our Enemies have both blamed and ri∣diculed us sufficiently for it, though it ten∣ded so manifestly to their Advantage, and was a Pig of their own Sow; and let me tell your Lordship, they did never believe our
King would so easily take the bait till they saw the blow struck; and this, I can assure your Lordship, so heightned their Hopes, and whetted them in the pursuit of their Ends upon our Court and Kingdom, that they almost never left any Motion, they had made for their turn, till it were Effected as much to their plenary Satisfaction, as to the Kings Dishonour and the Nations Ruine; and from hence forward you shall find them drive on their Designs upon us Jehu-like; the Par∣ticulars whereof I shall not fail to transmit to your Lordship, as often as I can have ac∣cess to take them out with out Suspition from the Minutes, where they are Deposited, and shall therefore now only subscribe my self, as I am in all sincere Devotion, My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble Servant. Paris, March 29. 1676. N. St.
LETTER VII. Of the Firing of the City of London, in 1666. My Lord, I Am fully satisfied by what I have both seen and heard at Paris and elsewhere, that the Duke of York was in the Year 1666. brought quite over to the French Interest; and I have heard strange Stories related con∣cerning his Conduct at the Time of that dreadful Conflagration of the City, looking upon it Janus-like, with one Face seeming concerned for the lamentable Disaster, and with the other rejoycing to see that noble Pile reduced to Ashes, and its Citizens ruin∣ed; who had at all Times been the greatest Propugnators for Liberty and Property, and opposers of that Religion which he now not only secretly profest, but was even ready publickly to own; and rewarding those In∣cendiaries at St. James, who then were sus∣pected generally to be French Men, as your Lordship well may remember; but by our Minutes it does appear they were not such; but they were Persons, at least many of them, set on Work by French Councils, and such as at that Time were of all Men least suspected;
I mean Jews, of which they had then seve∣ral in pay, not only in England, but all over Christendom; not only to give them Intelli∣gence in which they are wondrous Active, but likewise to promote and act the worse of mischiefs, as which they make no baulk. By these Fires have been kindled, not only in England, but in Germany, Poland and else∣where, which the Germans imputed to Tur∣kish Emissaries, though they were Jews hi∣red with French Money, the Turkish Policy not being so refined in Mischief; these sorts of Jews put on the shape of what Christians they pleased, and of this sort imploy'd by France, there were and are still several in England, the Names of one or two of which I think I shall be able to give your Lordship in some∣time, though they go by several, as Time and Occasion doth require, and so at present I remain My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble Servant. Paris, April 7. 1676. N. St.
LETTER VIII. Of the French Irruption into Flanders in the Year, 1667. My Lord, THe Dutch War, I have in a former Let∣ter mentioned to your Lordship, being ended, by the Treaty at Breda, July 9th. 1667. the French gained all the Ends they proposed by it; and more particularly (as to what I have before hinted) that both our King and People were now glad to be quiet, that some Disreputation was thereby cast in our Nation, but more on the King and Go∣vernment, which began to ingender new Discontents and Factions amongst us, which they took care to foment, that they might make use of them afterward, and that they having lately obliged the Dutch, thought now they might venture to extend their Limits in Flanders, and try what Fortune their Monarch would have against Spain, being his first undertaking, since he took upon him the Management of Affairs after Mazarines Death, wherefore new Pretensions were advanced for the Queen of France; which though most learnedly and more then sufficiently answered by that renown∣ed
Statesman the Baron d' Isola in his Treatise, called, The Buckler of State and Justice, and which I think I have seen in your Lordships Closet, yet it put no stop to the French Carreer, but on they carri∣ed the War, and that with such rapid Success, that they not only ravaged Artois, Hainault and other Parts of the Nether∣lands in a short time, but also took Charleroy, Oudenard, Aeth, Courtray and Lisle, besides what was done by them in the Franch Coun∣ty and Burgundy; but your Lordship is so well versed in things of this kind, that I shall forbear further to trouble you, and shall only tell you, that after the Spaniard had suffered great loss, and that the Dutch being both obliged by Treaty, and alarm∣ed at the too near Encroachment of so Potent a Neighbour, assisted the Spaniard with some Forces, which the Monsieur well observed, but for the Time dis∣sembled it, though he resolved both to remember and make use of it, when op∣portunity was put into his Hands, one way or other to his Advantage; the In∣tervention of the Tripple League did for the present put a Hook in his Nose, and so he claps up a Peace with the Spaniard, in 1668. with a Design to break it as soon as ever his Hands were let loose; and so I shall conclude this Letter with my hum∣ble Thanks to your Lordship for my last
re—: And hope I shall in my next be able to impart somewhat that will be more entertaining, till when I shall and ever will be ready My Lord, To serve and Honour you. Paris, April 11. 1676. N. St. LETTER IX. The Dutch allarm'd at the French King's Irruption into Flanders, sent a Letter to King Charles II. about it, a Copy of which Letter was transmitted to the French Court. My Lord, IF the Dutch underhand assisting the Spani∣ard, as I have mentioned in my last, set the French King upon Thoughts of Revenge, a perusal of the Contents of the States Let∣ter to our King upon the account of his En∣croachments, whetted his Fury to an high Degree; but all was smothered for the pre∣sent, there being many rubs that lay in his way that must first be removed; what the
Contents of the said Letter was, may be ea∣sily guessed at, but the sight of any true Co∣py of it I could ne're get; the general ru∣mour concerning it was, that our King should send it as soon as he had read it to the French King; but the Minutes say, it was only a Co∣py of it, that was transmitted into France, and that not by the King but that it was Surreptitiously gotten from the Secretaries-Office and sent to that Court; but that how∣ever they ordered their private Agents both in Holland and England, to report that our King sent it, that they might provoke the Hollanders to use such Carriage towards him, as might dispose him to join with the French in a new War against them; which they had a Design to put him upon in revenge of that Letter, and of the Succours the Dutch had sent the Spaniards, though no more then they were obliged to do defensively, pursu∣ant to the Tenour of their Peace with Spain; of which War with the Preliminaries tend∣ing to it, I shall not fail to transmit your Lordship an account—and such in many particulars, as I do not Question, but will be very grateful to your Lordship, Whose, Humble Servant I am. Paris, April 18. 1676. N. St.
LETTER X. A View of the State of the Reformed in France, from the beginning of Lewis the Fourteenth's Reign, to the Year 1669. My Lord, THE Reformed in the Kingdom of France, since the King came himself to the Ad∣ministration of the Government, had rather been retrench'd in their Liberties, and decli∣ned in Power than otherwise, whereas while Mazarine was Minister of State, he (notwith∣standing the Queen Mother's virulancy against them; whether it were to Cajole Cromwell and their then Governing Powers in England, or out of his avertion to the Clergy in general, of whose Abilities as well as Honesty he had no great Opinion) things went tolerably well with them; but now that the French King found himself couped up with the Tri∣ple League, and considering that any rigo∣rous Procedures against the Protestants in his own Dominions, would at this time be interpreted much to his disadvantage by those of other Nations, and particularly, that there was no hopes to break the said League, or to disunite it, especially the King
of England, of whom he conceived the grea∣test hopes, and had the greatest Eye upon, as being not only nearest, but also most powerful of any of the rest; it was resolved to put forth an ample Declaration in Favour of the Reformed, which revoked several un∣just Judgments given against them, and re∣medied many Important Difficulties and Se∣verities they laboured under, whereof they had made their Complaints to the King, and which gave them hopes that they should for the future be left to live in Tranquillity and Peace. They knew well enough, unless this were done, there was no very great like∣lihood to bring our King to their Bow, of whom the Parliament had already entertain∣ed some Jealousies, and who would not fail to be enraged, when they came to under∣stand he had entred into an Alliance with a King, who gave way to the Oppression of his Protestant Subjects: but this specious pretence of the French Indulgence, might serve him very well to amuse his Parlia∣ment, and at the same time to deceive him∣self; and the Protestant Nations in general without, might very well believe the French proceedings herein, and especially that part of it which related to the Reformed's future Tranquillity, were real; when they them∣selves in France were fully perswaded of it, and imagined that the Days of Henry IVth, were returned upon them again. It's cer∣tain
there had been considerable Efforts made, since our King's entring into the a∣forementioned Tripple Alliance, to have it further strengthned by the Accession of o∣ther Protestant Confederates into it; and that there was a certain Person whose Name was Marcilli, a Rocheller Born, and a Profes∣sor of the Reformed Religion, that took in∣defatigable pains in it; the true Story of this Man is very odd, and falling pat with the Design of this Letter, I shall give as con∣cise an Account of it as I can, not doubting of your Lordship's kind Acceptance; this Person, I say, taking the Advantage of the Conjuncture of the League between England and Holland, and very much doubting of the sincerity of the Declaration made in Favour of the Reformed in France thereupon, made his Application to several Protestant Princes about entring into the said Alliance, and was no small Instrument to induce the King of Swedeland to come into it, which gave occa∣sion of its being called the Tripple League. He had been also at our Court, and opened the King's Eyes, in relation to many things that had been misrepresented to him, and wherein he had been imposed upon, either by the French Agents, or the falsity of his own Ministers of State; but these Addresses of Marcilli were not long concealed from the French Court, wherefore they took Council, and dispatcht away the Mar-Marquess
De Ruvigni into England, with Instructions to take off those Umbrages our King had taken, upon the Conduct of the French Council towards him; the Marquess his Religion, being a Protestant, as well as his Capacity, recommended him as the fit∣test Person to assure the King of the since∣rity of the French proceedings, and that the Reformed should have all the Justice in the World done them; in short, the Mar∣quess did his Business so effectually at our Court, that tho' he were the Reformed's Deputy-General, he had almost Bankrupt his Credit with all the Churches, who did not a little resent his Complaisance upon that Head. Marcilli having done, as he thought, his Business in England, was gone upon the same Negotiation to the Swiss Can∣tons, not without Directions, as 'twas be∣lieved in France, tho' dissembled for a time, from our King, to induce the Swiss to come into the Alliance; whereof when Ruvigni had advertized the French Court, the King gave Mareschal Turenne, who yet made Pro∣fession of the Protestant Religion, Orders to Seize him, if possible, and Kidnap him back into France; the Mareschal to disguise the Matter as much as might be, and to give as little umbrage of any such Design as was pos∣sible, pitcht upon Three Officers making Profession of the same Religion with himself, to go into Switzerland to Seize him; the
sameness of Religion between Marcilli and them, gave them easie familiarity with him; so that at last having got him into a place where he could not be rescued, they hurried him into France, where he was Tryed forth∣with and Condemned; the Man during his Imprisonment, shewed all the Constancy both of a Brave and Innocent Mind, and all the Application of the Judges, and Rigour of the Questions put unto him, could never make him change his Language, but he main∣tained his Innocence to the last, and the Se∣crets he had been entrusted with by a great Prince, whom I have heard some of his very Enemies blame for not interposing in his be∣half, or afterward resenting of it at all, when there were some things put to him in relation to that Princes Person, that little suited with his Honour; even upon the pub∣lick place of Execution, just as the poor Man was broken upon the Wheel; and now, my Lord, they had Murdered his Body, they went about also to Murder his Fame, by giving out that they were forced to ex∣pedite his Execution, because that having found a piece of Glass in the Prison, he cut off his Privy Parts therewith, as thinking he might quickly bleed to Death, and so be his own Executioner; which notwithstand∣ing being soon observed by the Goaler, he gave the Officers notice thereof, who put him to Death Two Hours after. And that
France might seem to be sincere at all Points in respect to the Liberty of her Reformed Subjects, out came another Declaration in Au∣gust 1669, inviting all of them that Sojourn∣ed abroad, or were in the Service of For∣reigners, back into their Native Country, and particularly out of the United Provinces, where there were of them great numbers, as Officers, Soldiers, Merchants, Seamen, &c. but tho' they were thus liberal in their Pro∣mises to the Reformed, and made all the semblance of Sincerity in the World here∣upon, yet they never ceased underhand to tempt the most Considerable Persons amongst them, by large Donatives and Hopes of Pre∣ferment to come over to the Church of Rome, and what Success they had therein will be the subject of another Letter; and so I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble Servant. Paris, May 23. 1676. N. St.
LETTER XI. Of the Pervertion of the Prince of Tarent, Mareschal Turenne, &c. to the Ro∣mish Religion, about the Year 1669. My Lord, FRance, as I have informed your Lordship in my last, having invited her Subjects of the Reformed Religion home out of all quar∣ters, the Prince of Tarent, who had been settled several Years in the United Provinces, and possest of great Employments, quitted their Service thereupon, and returned to his Native Country, where he had not been long arrived, but he was Charmed into the Popish Religion, and all his Children, (sa∣ving one Daughter, afterward Married to the Prince of Oldenburg) following his Ex∣ample; This they looked upon as a good step, but what gave them a mighty accession of strength, as much as it was a diminution of the Power of the Reformed, was their gain∣ing of Mareschal Turenne to their Church, who, because so considerable a Person, and so famed for a great Captain, I shall recount unto your Lordship all that ever I could learn in relation to him upon this account. It's true, the Mareschal never did appear
to be a Person very Zealous for his Religion; but as he had from time to time given some Proofs of his Constancy, it was attributed to the Coldness of his Temper, which made him Calm enough in all things; but that Constancy that appear'd in him for a time, was attributed afterwards to other Causes, and primarily to the ascendency his Wife and Sisters had over him, his Lady being Daughter to the Duke De la Force, and a Person of Exemplary Piety, keeping of him steady in his Profession whilst she lived, and his Eldest Sister the Marchioness De Duras, al∣ways encouraging of him to be constant; and so Zealous she was, that she began to breed up one of her younger Sons, with a Design to make him a Minister, but that De∣sign not succeeding, & that Person going over very Young into Engl. has been since, as your Lordship well knows, advanced to Honour in the Kingdom. The youngest Sister the Dut∣chess of Trimonill never failed also of her Du∣ty towards the Mareschal in that kind. That the Marshal had been often tempted to change his Religion, is manifest; Cardinal Mazarine who had a great Opinion of him, made him many suggred Promises if he would come o∣ver; when the Dauphine was Born, he had Intimations given him, that he might one day be made his Governour, but that did not move him neither; the last Effort that was made upon him, was by the King him∣self
at the beginning of the Campaign in Flanders, in the Year 1667. when he pro∣mised him a share in all his Secrets, and higher degrees of Command, if so be he would Embrace the Communion of the Church of Rome, but this had the same suc∣cess upon him with the rest, and the Mares∣chal acted his part with so much sted fastness, and in so Noble a manner, that the King took no Displeasure thereat; and for this the Church at Charenton returned Publick Thanks to God, who had inspired him with such laudable Constancy, but without na∣ming of him, but some time after that Peace was concluded, when there was no more talk of him upon that Score, he entred into the Roman Communion, and it was given out he did it voluntarily, and of his own accord, and I could ne'er learn by whose Instigation it was done, or what were the true Rea∣sons that brought him to it, but however it was, this Change of his was attended with important Consequence, which did appear in due time; and this is all I could remark or learn concerning this Illustrious Person, on∣ly that he Abjured his Heresie (as they call it) in Notre-Dame, in presence of the Arch∣bishop of Paris; and so concludes, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble Servant. Paris; May 31. 1676. N. St.
LETTER XII. Of a Book Published in France, proposing Methods for to Ruin the Reformed, which had like to have spoiled the Court-Politicks, in pretending Favour unto them at that time. My Lord, I Have in a former Letter, shewed your Lordship the great Care the French Court took, to have it believed, both at Home and Abroad, that their Declaration in Favour of the Reformed was real, and like to be per∣manent, and what Politick Ends they had therein; but a Book Entituled, the Policy of France, came out not long after, to wit, in the Year 1669 that had like to have spoiled all the fine Web they had spun; It was supposed to be written by the Marquess De Chatelett, a Gentleman of Bretaign, and contained one entire Chapter of Methods to Ruin the Reformed, and he was so Adven∣turous as to Dedicate it to the King himself, and made him a Present of one of them; but his Zeal was but coarsly Rewarded, for he was sent to the Bastile for his Pains, and the Book supprest; but because the Methods he proposed therein were such as were very
odd, and may be put in Execution in time, and that I cannot send your Lordship one of the Books, I have taken out the Heads, and are as followeth; he proposed the Total De∣struction of them as a necessary Work, and reserved it for the present King, and whether he did really know, or was ignorant of the Court Designs, he did certainly I believe fit his Politicks to the Intentions of the Court. He represented them full of Re∣sentment for the loss of their Places of Securi∣ty, and of being always animated with Minds to Revolting, Confusion and Anarchy, and constantly ready to make use of any Oppor∣tunity to Re-establish themselves; He made them to be Enemies to the King's Prosperi∣ty, perpetual Obstacles to his Designs, and always to be feared because of their Animo∣sity, and of the number of good Soldiers, over which they could make Chiefs, by giv∣ing them Authority to Command them. He took upon him to shew, that the Protestants of Germany suffered themselves to be ruined without any Opposition, and that they had too much need of the King's Protection, to Embroil themselves with him: He said the same thing of England, Swedeland, Denmark, the United Provinces, and of all the Prote∣stants, whom he imagined to have been so linked to the King by strong Chains of In∣terest, that they would not concern them∣selves to hinder his Exterminating of the
Reformed Religion in his own Kingdom: He put a Malicious Interpretation upon the Reformed's taking up Arms in the last Civil Wars; and he pretended to Divine, that had it not been that the War had been so soon happily terminated, they would have form∣ed Grand Designs, made High Demands, and endeavoured to set up their Party again) He said, the Edict of Nants was revocable, as having been a thing extorted from the then King; and admitting it might have been formerly granted for the Benefit of the State, yet it might now be revoked for the very same reason: He was far from being of their Opinion, who thought that the Re∣formed were useful to the Church of Rome her self, because they obliged the Ecclesi∣asticks to Study, and lead Regular Lives; he said, that was a Trifling Argument, and concluded, that the King had sufficient Grounds to seek out ways to put them out of Condition to Hurt, or do any injury to his State. Having promised this, he was not of the Judgment to be rid of them by way of Banishment, as the Moors had been driven out of Spain; he looked upon that way of Treatment Inhumane, and withal prejudicial to the State, but he proposed Fifteen Expedients to be rid of them by lit∣tle and little. The first of which was, to procure a more familiar Intercourse between the Reformed and Catholicks. Secondly;
That they should be Rewarded with Estates and Honours that would be Converted, and to have a Fund setled for that end, which should ne'er be alienated; that for the ex∣citing of their Ambition, and not suppress that Passion in them which might serve as a Sting to their Conversion; He was of Opi∣nion that they should be permitted to Exer∣cise the smaller Offices, But not to give them great Places, but to the Catholicks only, for to Allure the Reformed to a Change of their Religion, in hopes to attain unto them. Thirdly, To Embroil the Affairs of parti∣cular Persons, so as to make them attend the Council, and principally the Gentlemen con∣cerning all the Dependances of the Exercises of their Families. Fourthly, To oblige them to Rebuild the Chappels they had Demolish∣ed or Prophaned, and that not by proceed∣ing against them in general upon that Head, but by Suing of particular Persons upon that Score, and to Recommend it to the Care of each Bishop in his Diocess. Fifthly, To hin∣der the Deputy-General to interpose there∣in, which he believed might be easily effect∣ed, because the Hugonots could not form a Body in France, and that particular Cases ought not to pass for publick ones, and that the King would Administer Justice without any Intervention; he would not have the Of∣fice of Deputy-General supprest, but reduce it only to a Name without any effect, and that
no regard should be had to the General Remonstrances of the Deputy. Sixthly, To order it so that none of the Reformed should be suffered to dwell in Cities, or the Seigniories, which did appertain to such as were of their Religion; and he would have it so as they could never want specious pre∣tences to colour that Innovation. 7thly, To suppress by Death the Charges of Councel∣lors among the Reformed. Eighthly, To send Catholick Commissries into the Sy∣nods, and to chuse such Persons for that end as understood Controversie, and knew how to foment any Differences which might arise in the Assemblies; to allow no National Synods; and to require Money of the Ministers for the King's Use, under pretence of Loan, Tythes, or some other Imposition. Ninthly, To Commence some Law-Suits against them for their Debts in common, and to cause some of their Churches to be Sold. Tenthly, To Enjoin all the King's Subjects not to de∣part the Kingdom without leave, for the Reformed would be comprehended under such a general Order. Eleventhly, To prevent any Catholicks by means of the Confessors, to put themselves into the Ser∣vice of the Hugonots. Twelfthly, To oblige them to observe the Fasting Days, under pretence of State Policy, for the same rea∣son as they were obliged to keep Holidays.
Thirteenthly, To endeavour to Marry the Reformed into Roman Catholick Fami∣lies, and to take Care that all the Chil∣dren proceeding from such Marriages, were brought up in the Roman Religion. Four∣teenthly, To hinder the Reformed to Sell their Estates in Land, for that such sort of Estates being not to be carried away, it would oblige them to keep within the Kingdom. And Lastly, he advised, That the University of Saumur should be removed to some other more inconvenient place, for which he furnished them with several pre∣tences; and he was of Opinion, that for lessening the number of Ministers, that the Candidates before they were received, should be obliged to go through a Course of Philosophy, or Study Divinity for Two Years; that they should be Examined be∣fore no other Commissioners than such as the King should name, and that none should be suffered to take the Function up∣on them till they were twenty-seven Years of Age. I have troubled your Lordship with a long Letter upon this ungrateful Subject, but I hope you'll pardon me, since I think it's not altogether Forreign to what I have some time since writ to your Lord∣ship, about the French Courts procedure in reference to the Reformed, whom they made it their chief Business to Cajole into a profound Severity, that they might have
leisure to carry on their Villanous De∣signs more securely; and therefore it was that this Book and the Author of it, run the Fate I have already recounted to your Lordship, whom I shall always endeavour to oblige to the utmost of my power; who am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble Servant. Paris, Iuly 8. 1676. N. St. LETTER XIII. Of the French Preparations for the War in the Year 1672 and how they compleated their Levies. My Lord, HAving in some measure traced the Me∣thods the French Councils used to settle their Affairs at Home, so as to receive no Molestation from Intestine Motions when they should carry their Arms Abroad; they began now to set their Instruments more closely to work in their Neighbour Nations, but more especially in England and Holland, not only to amuse and play
upon those that were at the Realm of Go∣vernment, but to feel the Pulse of, and tamper with all the several Factions among the People, and to make Creatures among them, that might manage them upon oc∣casion, as might seem most for their pur∣pose; while in the mean time they made vast Preparations underhand for War, both by Sea and Land, and the better to supply the Defects which seemed to be na∣tural to their Native Soldiers, caused Le∣vies to be made for them little or great, in all the European Nations, insomuch as by a List which I have seen, it did appear, they had in all, of Strangers only, about an Hundred and Sixty Thousand Men, be∣sides Seamen, of whom they had likewise Debauched a considerable number from Holland, England, Denmark and Swedeland. These mighty Preparations without any visible Pretension, Alarmed all the Powers of Christendom; but the most, because of the small Contests then in being, with the Pope about the Regale, and of some Dif∣ferences then depending about Lorrain and Alsatia, as your Lordship well knows, ima∣gined the Storm would break towards Italy, and part of Germany; till the Preparations of the then Bishop of Munster, and the Ad∣mission of French Garrisons into the Arch∣bishoprick of Cologn, and the Naval Prepa∣rations which appear'd last of all, filled
them with Apprehensions somewhat diffe∣rent from the first; among which neither England nor Holland were without some Fears, both which they took Care to allay, as the Minutes shew, by exasperating of them afresh by Secret Agents and Emissa∣ries, one against another; resolving ac∣cording as their Instruments should prevail on either to join with one against the o∣ther: But which of the two they should Attack, was a long time the Debate of the French Council, for one of them, it was resolved without Contradiction, must be Invaded; it being impossible to make any Successful Attempt upon the Empire, as long as those Two Countries maintained the Figure and Power they did then, and in that untoward Scituation for them too; England was then in a very unprepared con∣dition, having almost no Navy at Sea, and none but the ordinary Forces at Land, whereas theirs were all ready and well Disciplined and Commanded; and this unpreparedness of ours was a great Incite∣ment to most of the French Council, to put their King upon the Immediate Invasion of England with his whole Force, having al∣ready fore-felt the Hollanders, and found them, if not Inclinable to join with them in such a War, yet content to sit still and be quiet; they moved it so hotly that they had like to have carried it, which had
they, England had run a very great risque at that time of being Ruined; for said they, If we make sure of England first, we shut a Back door fast against all Danger, and may then securely Attack the Austrian Po∣tentates, having first Trampled down the Hollanders in our way, of whom, having made sure of the De Wits, (their then Chief Ministers) we shall find an easie prey: But just as the Ambition of that Mo∣narch was ready to take Fire at those so specious Motives, Monsieur Le Tellier, since Chancellor and Father to Monsieur Lou∣vois, the Eldest and Ablest Statesman and Minister of France interposed; the sub∣stance of whose Speech I shall take Care to transmit to your Lordship in my next, who am, My Lord, Your very Humble Servant. Paris, August 23. 1676. N. St.
LETTER XIV. Containing an Account of Mons. Le Tel∣lier's Arguments to disswade the French King from the Invasion of England. My Lord, ACcording to my Engagement in my last, I shall now entertain your Lord∣ship with Mons. Le Tellier's Remonstrance, upon the Advice given the French King to Invade England; He did acknowledge, that the Counsel proposed was in it self ve∣ry good, supposing there were a certainty of effecting it; but it was to be considered, that it would prove of most pernicious Consequence in case the same were At∣tempted without Success. That England was the Rock against which the late for∣midable Power of Spain, had dasht in pieces its Aspiring Fortunes, and that the like Ex∣pedition now by the House of Bourbon, would prove alike Fatal to its Rising Power, unless they were Infallibly sure of their Blow; For to meddle with England at all, unless they could absolutely Conquer it, would be but to rouze a sleepy Lion, slur the Reputation of their Arms, and singe the Wings of their growing Great∣ness,
before they were fully fledg'd; That it was impossible to make such a Conquest, but by Intestine Divisions or Surprize, un∣less they were first Masters of its Outworks, the Low Countries; That for a Surprize he thought it almost impracticable; and that tho' it was possible they might ure the Hollanders to join with them, and England was then indeed unprovided of Forces both by Sea and Land, yet there was no trusting to that, because there were no Fa∣ctions then, whose Designs were ripe e∣nough to Favour such an Enterprize: And that tho' they should prove so Successful in that Advantagious Juncture, as to enter England, they could expect no greater Ad∣vantage by it, than just to frighten the King and the Nation, and plunder them of a little Wealth, and so be gone, ma∣king but a Tartarian Expedition of it; Be∣cause the universal and strong Antipathy of the English People, both High and Low, against the French Name and Domination, would be an Invincible Obstacle to their setling there, and would quickly make that Island too hot for them. That there∣fore meerly to Attack and Pillage them, without being able to reduce them totally, would but whet the Animosity of those Warlike Nations, whose Courage had al∣ways been wont to be heightned by Dis∣graces, and was always Victorious, when
once fired with Indignation; That such an Enterprize would for ever alienate the Heart of the then King, and the whole Roy∣al Family, from the French Interest, and make them by Inclination as well as Interest, not only give way to, but passionately to a∣bet and make most Advantagious use of the Natural Animosity of their most Warlike Subjects against France; That it would Unite the Peoples Hearts so firmly to their King, and create so much mutual Confidence be∣tween them, that it would be impossible af∣terward to divide them, and so raise the Power of that Monarchy to a pitch, from which it could not chuse but prove both for∣midable and fatal to them; That it would rouze up the King, then almost Drowned in Voluptuousness and Sensual Delights, and make him a Man both of War and Business against his Will, and cause him to enter in∣to such Alliances with the House of Austria, and other Powers, as must needs be of Per∣nicious Consequences to the Designs of their great Bourbonian Hero; That therefore it was better not to think of any such Attempt, England being like a Flint, sooner broken by soft than hard Methods; That the King him∣self, and also his Brother, were much French by Inclination at present, that the former was very Indulgent to his Pleasure, that he was that way so Profuse and Prodigal, that he would always be Necessitous of Money,
which his Parliament beginning to grow weary of giving him, it would e'er long cause such strugglings between the Courtiers and Patriots of the Country, as would give them ample Scope to compass their Ends in Eng∣land, by a more sure and less dangerous way than by a War, which in all appearance would defeat all the Advantages they might otherwise reap there by other Methods. That therefore the best way was to endeavour to take Advantage of the King's Infirmities, to try whether there were a Witty French Beau∣ty, that could be Fortunate enough to gain on his Affections, for that such an one would be a most Admirable Instrument for them; That they should offer him Money, and feed his Extravagance that way, send dexterous Persons well furnished with Golden Charms, to work on all the Leading Men among all their Factions, and secretly to keep some Pensioners, both among their Courtiers, Pa∣triots and Church-men, and blow up and fo∣ment new Divisions; That they should send thither some very able Embassador, and keep him there a long time; That they should in∣cite the Hollanders to a new War with the English, and the English with them, and treat with and Promise Assistance to the former, to the last Moment; but in Conclusion join with the latter, if it were possible to per∣swade the English King to a War. And that on that pretence, they might procure such
numbers of English Forces, especially Foot, as might not only amend the Defects of their own Soldiery, which still came very short in good Infantry, but bring their own Native People by degrees, inferring daily Examples of Strangers Bravery, to imitate their Cou∣rage and Firmness in Set-Battels, and to get a Stock of good Infantry by Land, by draw∣ing the English to them against the Dutch, as they had already done of good Ships by Sea, and Warlike Munitions, by joining before with the Dutch against the English in the former Wars. Yet that they might so order things, that whatever Stipulations were made with the King of England to his Advantage, to allure him to such a War, should be eluded, and he only made a Tool of; That tho' it was likely the Parliament of England, would upon any great Success of the French, be for breaking of the War, and deny the King Money to continue it longer, yet after they had made a sufficient Impressi∣on on the Netherlands, they might prevail by their Golden Arguments upon the King, at least to continue Neuter, and leave his Land Forces still in the French King's Ser∣vice for some considerable time; That this Juggling would in a little time raise Animo∣sities and Jealousies between the King and Court-party, and that of the Patriots; make the latter to deny him Money, press hard upon his Prerogative, raise new Pretensions
about Liberty and Property, which if care∣fully fomented by dexterous Agents, would give the King and People there work enough in mutual Contests at Home, which would hinder them from acting any thing conside∣rable Abroad, keep the King always under a necessity of continuing their Pensioner, for fear of becoming his Parliaments Underling; yet prop him up so as to preserve him in a Capacity, still to be able to keep them in some sort under, and hinder the daring English Senate, from attaining any more so much the Soveraignty, as to Erect themselves into a Republick; He telling them from the Famous Cardinal Richlieu's Authentick Ob∣servation, that an Absolute Monarch, or a Republick in the Brittish Dominions, would prove almost alike Fatal to France; that therefore it was the best way to endeavour a Mean between this Scylla and Charibdis, by keeping a Ballance between King and Par∣liament, and fomenting perpetual Contests between them, which was to be done by ha∣ving unknown Instruments to sow Jealousies among the Patriots and People against the Court, and make them cross the latter; and at the same time make use of that crosness as an Argument to perswade the King, that his Authority could be no way safe without sticking to their Alliance, and feed him with Money both to enable him to carry on his Business and Pleasure without a Parliament,
and to Animate him from time to time to Prorogue and Dissolve them upon occasion. And when upon some Success of the King and Court—party, they should begin to make such steps towards Absolute Power, as might, if attained to, prove dangerous to the French Interest, and Embolden our Monarch to slip his Neck out of their Collar; then anew to stir up the Patriots and Popular Party against him, and abandon him wholly to them, till he were forced to break them, by returning to their Alliance again. That above all things they were not to forget to make their best use of that mighty Engine called Religion, which tho' powerful all the World over, yet was of more prodigious force among the English People, than among any other in the habita∣ble Earth: Now this Advice, my Lord, as coming from so Old and Experienced a States∣man, and the Ablest Disciple who had Viva Voce, heard the Documents and Precepts of the great Richlieu, that Famous Architect of the French Grandure, was assented to both as the Wisest and Securest, and was afterward in every Punctilio put in Execution, as Time and Conjunctures afforded occasion; whereof your Lordship may expect an account in due time from him who is, My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble Servant. Paris, Sept. 17. 1676. N. St.
LETTER XV. Of the Methods the French use in keeping Intelligence among their Neighbour-Nations, &c. My Lord, I Cannot think but that your Lordship will be pleased to understand how the French keep their Correspondence among, and make Tools of Men and Parties most averse to them in their Neighbour-Nations, and whom no manner of Motives would ever be preva∣lent enough to make Instrumental to pro∣mote an Interest so hateful to them, did they but know who they wrought for, and it is, my Lord, in this manner. Would they set the Conformists and Nonconformists peckee∣ring at one another? Thus they did it pre∣sently after the first Dutch War, in order to prepare Factions to make way for the De∣signs which followed. They had diligent Spies to inform them where Men of quaint Wits, brisk Tempers, Self-conceited, but A∣theistical in Principles, or at least of very loose Morals were to be found, as likewise to take notice of those that were in reality most Able and more Zealous, both of Confor∣mists and others, in their several ways, than
the rest of their Brethren; Then the first, by some Persons that pretended to admire their Wits, and that were French Pensioners, (tho' some of them did not know it) were either by some present modicum of Money, Promise of Preferment, or sometimes by the meer tickling Praises of the said qualified Persons, put upon writing something that might check Religion, particularly that Established; Then they knew the Crime would be laid at the Door of some Nonconformists, and cause the Reforming Clergy to write bitterly and re∣flectingly against them, and them again to justifie themselves and recriminate, till at length they engaged not only the Body of the Nation, but even their August Repre∣sentatives likewise in their Quarrels, and so from Religious Contests produced State Fa∣ctions, and in this all of them, tho' they were of different Parties, were told they would please both their King, Parliament and Country; For the Dissenters were told, that tho' for Policy's sake the King did not publickly abet them, yet he was secretly dis∣posed to favour them, and such Writings, if well penned, would not displease, and might procure them at last Ease in a Parliament, &c. And for the Conformists, they were easily perswaded, that by Ridiculing the Dis∣senters, immoderately extolling the Excel∣lency of their own Ceremonies, and the Su∣perlative extent of the Prerogative, they
could not fail to please neither. And thence, My Lord, came that Legion of Books of that Nature, that came out in the Interval between the Two Dutch Wars, and which made way for After-Divisions, of which I saw a Catalogue, with the Books printed, and of what Service they were for the Inte∣rest of the French Court; Some I have forgot, and some I remember, but shall not name a∣ny, for fear of reflecting on any worthy Per∣sons, who, I am perswaded, did not know by what Instruments they were abetted on either side. Then for keeping several Lords and Commons too in Pension to their Ends, without their Knowledge, thus they did it; They had their Jews, and some other Bankers at their Devotion, who would under an Ob∣ligation of great Secrecy, tell them; that they were ordered to allow them so much Money, saying sometimes it was from their own King, to do him some private Service, in or out of Parliament, or from the Spanish, Imperial, or Dutch Ambassadors, under pretence of serving their Interests, and their own Coun∣tries too, against Prerogative, Oppression in Religion, &c. and oftentimes directly to op∣pose Popery, and the French Interest, that by firing them on with too great vehemency to pursue those Points, the French Court might more easily compass other Ends aimed at, which they whom they thus incited did not so much as dream of; Thus while many in
our Parliaments were so fierce against Papists, Arbitrary Power, and the French Interest, and cried out against all of the Court-party as French Pensioners (tho' 'tis true, too many of them were so) as does appear; yet little thought they, that they were likewise so themselves, and never imagined the same French were Abettors of both Parties: And the better to cover this underhand play, they drew off most of the Money they em∣ploy'd to this latter sort, by the way of Ge∣noa, Florence, Amsterdam, and Hamburg; that it might not be discovered, it came Ori∣ginally from France; Nay, my Lord, by the by, be pleased to take notice that one main cause of the French King's Indignation against Genua, tho' it be a very secret one, and known to few, was their Bankers cackling, and discovering to the Agents of the House of Austria, the Money privately sent and dispersed, and sent towards Poland, Hungary, Turky, and some other Parts not named, and has made them imploy none e∣ver since almost, but what are openly or co∣vertly Jews, who serve the French King with great Fidelity for these Reasons. 1. He is in their Esteem the most Power∣ful in Christendom. 2. Because he Favours the Grand Turk, where they have so great a Commerce, and are in such numbers. 3. Because he gives them a liberty by con∣nivance, tho' not open Toleration.
4. Because he is so great an Enemy to the Austrian Family, who have been so Cruel to them by the Inquisition, and by Banishing them not only out of the Spanish Territories, but likewise out of the Emperor's Hereditary Countries. 5. And lastly, Because he seems to them to be of no Religion, but almost as great a Scourge to the Christians in general, both Popish and others, as the Turk, Tartar, or Barbarian; their Principles naturally leading them to admire and revere any thing they think a Plague to Christians, whom they are taught to Curse daily, even in their Solemn Prayers; and therefore England had need have a Care of them in this Juncture. But as for the Pensions they gave the Courtiers, they Industriously affected the transmission of those Moneys from France, and had their Agents busie to buzz it abroad, in order to render them odious to the Peo∣ple, and to incite the Patriots the more vio∣lently against them; And tho' a great part of the Money they allowed the King from time to time, were sometimes transmitted from the abovementioned Places, and some from Venice, yet private notice was present∣ly given to their Agents in England and else∣where, with positive Orders to inform the World of the Truth of that Intrigue; unless it were some time when a particular Critical Juncture might require a contrary Procedure.
My Lord, this is the Sum of what I could learn in respect to their Correspondence in England, either from the Minutes or private Conversation, of which your Lordship is sensible, I have as great an Opportunity as a∣ny other, and with which I shall at present conclude, who am, My Lord, Your Honour's most Humble Servant. Paris, Iuly 11. 1684. N. St. LETTER XVI. Of the French King's frequent Reviews of his Troops in 1670. and of the umbrage taken in England thereupon, and of the Duke of Buckingham's Embassy into France. My Lord, I Have formerly given your Lordship an Account of the great Levies in France, and vast Preparations for War both by Sea and Land, what Care had been taken to se∣cure the Domestick Peace in the mean time, and what the Opinion of the French Mini∣sters of State were, in regard to what Coun∣try should be Invaded by them. And I am now to acquaint your Lordship, that when
their Military Preparations were pretty for∣ward, which was in the Year 1670. they began to make frequent Reviews of their Troops, which to amuse, they continued till the end of the next Year, in several Bodies towards as many different Frontiers, that their Neighbour—Nations being used to them, and seeing no Effects follow, might think they were only done out of a Vanity to make Ostentation of the French Power and Gran∣dure, to keep their Soldiers in Discipline, and find their Nobility and Active Spirits Em∣ployment, who else might busie themselves for want of Occupation in disturbing the State: The Artifice took, so that most of their Neighbours, tho' now and then they were troubled with a Fit of Thoughtfulness and Suspicion, begun to grow secure, and particularly the Hollanders, who thought the French King so much in Jest, that they tau∣tingly called him, Le Roy des Reveues, till more extraordinary and more visible Preparations and Movements, did by degrees begin to convince them of their Errour; for when they had thus finished their Reviews, they suddenly drew a very considerable Ar∣my, composed of the Flower of all their Forces towards Calais and Dunkirk, (the Dutch being in the mean time tampered with, as I am apt to believe concerning the Invasion of England; but yet now full of Jealousie at their Proceedings) and here it
was the Council was held about the Eligibi∣lity of employing their Force, the Debates whereof I have already given your Lordship an Account. And as the Dutch were Jealous upon this approach, the English were much more (as your Lordship may well remem∣ber) to see such a Power brave England on the opposite Shore, and look with an Amo∣rous Eye towards it; and the more because of the unprepared Posture the Nation was then in; insomuch that it was thought ad∣visable, to dispatch an Embassy to sound the Intentions of the French Monarch in regard to England; whereupon Choice was made of the Duke of Buckingham, who admirably well maintained that Character, and the Glory of Great Britain, on that Occasion; and demean∣ed himself with such an Intrepidity of Mind and Conduct, and with such a Grandure and Unconcernedness at the Formidable Armed Powers he saw before his Eyes, that those who had been Strangers to the then Condi∣tion of our Nation, would have thought he had been sent from a Prince that was at the Head of twice as big an Army, as the French King at that time shewed the Duke: And that Conduct did not a little appall the Pre∣sumption of that Ambitious King, and con∣tributed much to the inclining of him to ac∣quiesce in Monsieur Le Tellier's Counsel; but then withal, making him take notice of the Rare and more than ordinary Parts and Abi∣lities
of the said Duke, it put him naturally upon concluding that it was well worth the while to endeavour to gain such a Person o∣ver to his Interest, whose Influence might be great, either in bringing his Prince to such a Compliance as he desired; or at least in briguing for France against him, in case he proved inflexible: To this end, such Complements were past upon the Duke, and such extraordinary Honours done him, and Presents made him, as never no Embassador before nor since hardly ever received; inso∣much as the Duke suffered himself to be Charmed, and ever since favoured the French Interest, either with or against his Prince, as Occasion or Policy directed. In fine, he was told, that the French King indeed, tho' he had great Temptations from Opportuni∣ty and Interest to Attack England, yet such was his Respect and Inclination for our King, that he was more disposed to imploy his Forces against Holland; And that he might with the surer Success undertake such an Ex∣pedition, his Majesty earnestly prest the Duke to do his utmost to Influence his Ma∣ster to join his Naval Forces with him in that War, by which means he might Revenge the Disgraces received in the last, especially that of Chatham, as likewise the fresher In∣solencies of that Saucy Republick, whose Vi∣cinity and Power was so much the more dan∣gerous to the Brittish Monarchs, than to any
other Crowned Heads, as the Subjects of these Nations were more prone to hanker after the Liberty Enjoy'd by the Hollanders, and to imitate their Successful Example; That by so doing, his Excellency would do his own Prince very great Service, and have the Ho∣nour of Obliging a great Monarch, who was as Generous in his Resentments, as Formi∣dable in Power, &c. The Duke returned Home well satisfied, and brought a pleasing Answer to our King, and plyed him warm∣ly with the Proposition aforesaid, tho' at first he was not much harkned too; but how, when and by whose means their Designs were afterward Accomplished, your Lord∣ship may expect to hear, when Conveniency serves, from, My Lord, Your very Humble Servant. Paris, Nov. 30. 1676. N. St.
LETTER XVII. Of the Princess Henrietta Maria Dutch∣ess of Orleans's being sent Anno 1670. from the French Court, to dispose the King to a second War with the Dutch, in Conjunction with the French. My Lord, THe French Court having, as I told your Lordship in my Last, gain'd the Duke of Buckingham entirely to their Interests, they began now to conceive some hopes to bring our King to joyn with them against the States, at least wise with his Naval Power, of which they had most need; and therefore to strike while the Iron was hot; they deliberated of sending over an Em∣bassador of their own into England to ne∣gotiate the Matter; but to colour the In∣trigue, as if they had no Design of their own thereby, and to give no Matter of Jealou∣sie to their Neighbours, especially the U∣nited Provinces. It was agreed, it should be a Female Embassadress the Kings fair Sister Henrietta Maria Dutchess of Orleans, and so give out at the same time, she went over purely on a visit to her Royal Bro∣thers,
and that it was with some seeming Reluctancy the French King upon her ear∣nest Application to him to that Purpose gave his Consent; But she was furnished with such Proposals, which they knew well that sent her, none could with equal safety and privacy Advance, nor none with equal Power and Influence recom∣mend; and to secure the whole Transa∣ction from the very Suspitions, as well as the Penetration of any not of their Ca∣bal, and to make it appear as a pure visit, and the effect of natural Affection and void of all Intreague, her return was limited to so short a Time, and in so peremptory and notorious a Manner, that it might in∣duce the World to believe them too Suspi∣tious of the natural Inclinations, that Prin∣ces might still retain for her Royal Bro∣thers, and for the Weal of her and their Native Country, so incompatible with the exorbitant grandeur of France, to entrust her with any of the mysterious Arcana's of their Politicks; and so might prevent all Jealousie in England, at that critical Jun∣cture of that interview, by shewing so great an Apprehension of it themselves: She was charged with the same Message partly, and with some of the same Arguments, which they had endeavoured to insinuate by the Duke of Buckingham; but having an incomparable Advantage above him,
or any other Embassador to back whatso∣ever she advanced with all the Charms that a most accomplished and lovely Princes, and an only and most beloved Sister, could be armed with; she who had Wit and Dex∣terity enough, to manage those Priviledges to the utmost Advantage, not only prest the said Matter, and more home and with infinitely more Freedom and Efficacy, but adventured to propose, yet higher things and of a much more extended Conse∣quence; For addressing her Speech to the King (though not without intermixing some Expressions equally affecting also to her Brother the Duke of York) she told his Majesty that as she hoped neither of her Royal Brothers had any Reason to call in Question her natural Affection to their Persons, and inseparable Inclinati∣on for whatsoever did, or should at any Time appear to her to be conducing to their true Interest, so she believed they had as little cause to doubt, but she could see as far as another into the French Monarchs Heart, who loved her and admired her to that Degree, though innocently, as gave no small Umbrage to Monsieur his Bro∣ther, and her Husband; And that she did sincerely represent, both as his most Chri∣stian Majesty's Sence, and her own, that the only way to secure to his Majesty, and the present Royal Family of England, a
stability in the Throne they were lately Restored to, afer so dismal an overthrow of the Monarchy, in the Reign and Per∣son of their unhappy Father, and to rein∣state the Majesty of the Brittish Kings in its former Splendor and Security, enjoyed so long and gloriously in Catholick Times, was by all Wise and Politick Mans to la∣bour to introduce into these Kingdoms, the Catholick Religion, and to re-assume by Degrees absolute Power. or that the Church of England by woful Experience had been found too weak alone to defend the Crown, and that the Dissenters were so stifly Principled for a Common-Wealth, that they would never leave till they had once more overturned the Monarchy, unless his Majesty would timely provide for his Security, by Methods o be proposd to him by her, and the most Christian King; who she knew had the atmost tenerness for his Interest, as was clear enoh by all Ex∣pressions of his real Inclinations, nce they were emancipated from the estraints, laid upon them under the Tutelag o a Cardi∣nal, who was a Master in pure Politicks, and altogether unacquainted with those nobler and more heroick Sentiments of Honour and Generosity, which are no less natural and unextinguishable in a born Prince, then common Reason is in the est of Mankind: The chief of which ex∣pedients
were flattering of the Church of England, and first persecuting by Act of Parliament the Protestant Dissenters, and wheedling with them again by a Preroga∣tive Lenitive, and so by the not to be Questioned acceptance of the Suffering Protestants on the one hand, and the no less assured Non-opposition of those of the established Church on the other, as by an irresistible Charm to lay asleep that watch∣ful Dragon, that had so long kept the gold∣en Apples of Contention between the King and People, from the Ravishment of the most enterprizing Monarch; and break that mischievous Devil, that had of late been so busie in asserting pretended Liber∣ties; and advancing the Soveraignty of old hateful Laws, above the more Sacred Majesty of the Princes, the only rightful Legislators, whilst the Crown as securely as unregardedly might seize, and seizing or all Perpetuity, appropriate as to it sell the important Jewel of Dispensing Power, which would fix and fasten the whole Chappelet of unbounded Soveraignty, by making us of that Popular Relaxation, to indulge the Faction esteemed the most dan∣gerous to the Monarchy, and to decoy them into a favouring of those Encroachments upon the Laws, and upon the Peoples Fundamental Right, and therein the Le∣gislation, who seemed of all Men the most
deeply principled against them; And so in effect to make those very Persons, the tools for the Erection of Absolute and Despo∣tick Sway, who otherwise could hardly be reconciled to the most Just, most Legal, and most Moderate Royalty. So far were the measures to be observed at home; and those which she and their Brother of France advised to be used abroad, were 1. To endeavour by all possible means the Subversion of the Republick of Hol∣land, the perpetual Source of Rebellion in England. 2. In order, with so much the more Expedition, certainty and Safety to effect the Reduction both of his own People, and of that ntward Neighbouring Nest, and receptacle of Plotters and Rebels; To resolve upon a firm and inviolable adhe∣rence to the Interest of the most Christian King, who in that Case would no way desert him, but vigorously and powerfully aid him, and carry him through all Dif∣ficulties; But in Case, added she, his Ma∣jesty could not satisfie his Conscience wel enough, to attempt any such Change in Religion (as she just now had mentioned) or notwithstanding all remonstrances to the contrary, should continue over-perswa∣ded of the two great Difficulty, or impra∣cticableness of such an enterprize, that however as a Protestant of the Church of
England, which was firm to Monarchy, if he desired to put himself into a Condition to Protect, and that Reciprocally to Defend him and his Successors in time to come; It would be absolutely necessary for him at least, to concurr with his most Christian Majesty in Subduing the Republick of Holland; That besides the Advantage of such a Repartition of the Conquered Country, as he could rea∣sonably expect, he should find upon the re∣duction of it, that the Commonwealth Fa∣ction in England, and her Two other Sister Kingdoms, would dwindle away of it self, and so the King would not only become Ab∣solute Master of his People, but as his Chri∣stian Majesty would concert the Sharing of those Provinces with his Brother of England, the Naval Power and Trade of Great Brit∣tain would receive an incredible augmenta∣tion by the Destruction of a State, that was her only Competitor at Sea, and for Com∣merce and Riches promoted thereby; For that not only their Shipping and Seamen, toge∣ther with their Chief Sea-ports, and bet Sea provinces, all entire would be his Maje∣sty's, but also that all the most Wealthy and Substantial Merchants, and Industrious and Ingenious Tradesmen and Artificers, even of the Provinces and Parts that should fall to the Share of the most Christian King, would in all appearance transplant them∣selves either into England or Ireland, as ly∣ing
more convenient for Trade, than their own Country, or at least into those Parts of the Netherlands which should be reduced un∣der the Power of the King of Great Brittain; To whose Domination, as approaching near∣est the Sweetness and Freedom of that they now were under, they would certainly more willingly submit their Persons and Fortunes, than to that of the more Absolute one of the French Monarch, for which they had enter∣tained a Thousand Prejudices. In fine, she most earnestly and affectionately besought him to take those Matters into his most serious Con∣sideration, and to return a speedy, and if it might any ways be, a favourable Answer, that she might have the Happiness to return back the Messenger of good News, and such News as might prove a Foundation of a last∣ing Felicity to both the Illustrious Families, from which both his Majesty and her self were descended. The King after a little si∣lence, told her by way of Reply to the things she had represented to him, That it was impossible for him to doubt of the ar∣dency and reality of the Affection of a Sister so Amiable, and who had always exprest so much Tenderness for his Interest; That he as little questioned, but that she had penetra∣ted as far into the Interiors of his Brother of France, as it was possible any one could into the Heart of a King, and therefore upon her Representation of him chiefly, which he
assured her would induce him to give the more Credit to the Favourable Conjectures, he had made of his Temper, during the lit∣tle time he had the Honour to Converse with him whilst in Exile, and to the general Cha∣racter he had, since his Personal Administra∣tion of Publick Affairs, obtained in the World, of being a Prince of great-Honour and Generosity, and thereupon passing by some former unhandsom and unkind Treat∣ments in his Court, as pure Effects and In∣fluences of the over-ruling Ascendant of the then Regnant Mazarine, and not of that Prince's own Inclination; he should put much Confidence in the sincerity of the most Christian King, and accordingly desired her to return his said Majesty, his Royal and most Hearty Thanks for those obliging Ex∣pressions of Amity and Affection, he had signified to him by her, and to assure him in his Name, he should ever have his Friend∣ship in high Esteem, and would go as great lengths as in Prudence and Interest he could, to serve him, and to comply with his De∣sires: But that the Matters proposed being of the highest Consequence, he must beg his Excuse if he required more time to give him a positive and satisfactory Answer thereto, than the short space limitted for her stay in England would permit; however, that he would with all convenient Expedition give him a better Account; In the mean while,
he should Request his most Christian Brother by her, to do him the Justice to believe he was as sincerely affectioned to his Person, as he could be to his, and should ever persist to be as far as a King of Engl. could, his constant and most Obsequious Friend: The like Com∣plement, as far as it was agreeable to his Circumstances, was returned by the Duke; After which the Princess renewing the Charge in the Business of Religion, the King freely told her, That as to that Point, tho' he had entertained very kind and favourable Thoughts of the Roman Religion, and its Professors, for several Reasons he instanced, and did believe, that if it were Re-establish∣ed in his Dominions, the Monarchy would be safer and easier than it could be under the present state of Protestancy, yet he was not so fully satisfied in it, as to make it his own Religion; and that on the other side he foresaw such unsurmountable Difficulties in attempting such a Re-establishment, that he did not think any Policy, no, nor the whole Power of France, could he Command it all entire, without any divertion from other In∣terested Neighbours, (too extraordinary a Juncture to be probably expected) could be able to carry him through them: To which, the Princess who saw well enough, as well by his Looks and Actions as by his Expressi∣ons, that she had made more sensible Im∣pressions
upon his Spirits, than he was wil∣ling to acknowledge; thinking she had done enough for her part, and sufficiently broke the Ice, for those that should be designed to push the Point further at more leisure, mo∣destly replied; That since that was his Ma∣jesty's Sence, in which he was fixed, she would wave all farther Importunities on that Subject, and leave it wholly depending between himself and God, whom she would continually pray to Inspire his Majesty with Light enough to know, and Courage enough to embrace the Truth, in his appointed time; But however, she should be glad to know his Majesty's Sentiments as to the De∣sign against Holland; adding, that she was confident, he could not but think it was at least for his Interest, and seasible too: Yes, Madam, answered the King, I am Convin∣ced that if crowned with Success, it would be enough for the Interest of this Monarchy, and of my People too; but yet as practica∣ble as it seems to be to you, it is likewise not without its Difficulties, and those very great ones too; for the ill Success of my last War with that Nation, the Dissatisfacti∣on of my People thereupon, the Tripple League in which I am lately engaged with Holland, the Inclination my Subjects have for the Dutch, as being a Protestant Nation, and the Implacable Avertion they have to
the French, and their Jealousies of their Power, and of their Religion, are mighty Obstacles in the way; However, if my Bro∣ther of France can propose me any practica∣ble Expedients to remove them, which I much doubt, I will, as I have said, do what I can to comply with him in that Enterprize: And so the Princess declaring her self well satisfied, with what had been said upon the Subject of her Errand, they passed from the Businesses of State, to the Divertisements of the Court, from which being obliged much sooner to break off than they were willing, by the more swift than welcome approach of the time Limitted for her departure, with unconceivable Regret, and ill-presaging Tears, she took her leave of her Royal Bro∣thers; tho' little did she or they imagine it to be her last Farewel, for soon after her return to France she died, not without vehe∣ment Suspicion of being Poisoned; But that her Husband the Duke of Orleance, had any just Cause given him further to foment his Jealousie of her upon this Visit, (for he cer∣tainly was suspitious of her Conduct before any mention of that Journey) and so push∣ed him on to the practice of undue means to accelerate her Fate, has been a Matter of much Discourse both in England and France, and continues to this Day a Mystery, which I will not nor cannot pretend to determine,
and so begging your Lordship's Pardon for this tedious Epistle, I remain, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble Servant. Paris, Feb. 3. 1677. N. St. LETTER XVIII. Of Mrs. Carewell's coming into England in 1670. and introduced to be the King's Miss. My Lord, IN one of my Letters to your Lordship, concerning Monsieur Le Tellier's Senti∣ments, in regard to the Management of the Affairs of England to the Advantage of the French, among other Expedients he propo∣sed the sending over some Choice Female, as might be capable to Charm a Prince, whose Heart was so susceptible of an Amorous Flame as that of the King of England; In Conformity to which Project, they made Choice of the Opportunity of the Princess's going over to effect it, and therefore she upon her Arrival presented our King, her Bro∣ther, with her Woman, known then by the
Name of Madam Carewell, but much better since by the Title of Dutchess of Portsm: to serve the French King as a Heifer afterwards to Plow withal, as being such as was not carelesly or fortuitously picked out from a∣mong the French Herd, but expresly singled out for that purpose: And how well she acted her part in time coming will appear in its proper place, so that if they failed in their Ends of furnishing the King with a French Wife, they were resolved to make it up, by supplying of him with a French Whore; and this being an Omission in my last, and having nothing of greater Moment to write at present, to keep my Correspon∣dence with your Lordship, I have taken the Opportunity to testifie unto you how ready I am, My Lord, To Serve You. Paris, Feb. 13. 1677. N. St.
LETTER. XIX. The paces made by the Duke of Bucking∣ham, and afterward by the Princess Henrietta Maria Dutchess of Orleans, towards bringing the King over to joyn with the French against the Dutch, not fully succeeding according to ex∣pectation, they resolve upon other me∣thods: First by making sure of the Duke of York, and then by inciting the Dutch to provoke the King to a War with them. My Lord, I have given your Lordship an account of the Princess Henrietta's Negotia∣tion in England, and of the Kings dila∣tory Answer, in regard to his Conjuncti∣on with the French to make War upon the United Provinces, which put the French Polititians somewhat to a Nonplus; but considering how well inclined the Duke was to the Popish Re∣ligion, and how he had exprest his thoughts to the Princess, the King be∣ing present, of the advantage and reason∣ableness of the French Proposals, they made
an Essay, to see what they could do that way, and whether the great con∣fidence he had with, and Influence over his Brother might not induce him to accept of the offer. They found him plyable enough; but upon Application, he did not find the King so, but much more disposed to live at Rest and Pleasure, than to engage himself in so much Sollicitude, as a War would inevitably bring him to; And besides, he was much afraid to discontent his People further, who were already so ill satisfied, with the ill Conduct and Disasters that befel them in the last War, and whom he knew so wholly averse to a new one, unless the Fresh Water-Gandy-Caps and Feathers especially were dismissed, and the Con∣duct of it wholly left to the Old Tar∣polians, who so successfully asserted their Cause with those People in the Repub∣lican and Oliverian times, the happiness of which the late ill Success had much enhaunsed in their Eyes. Yet the French Agents continued pressing of him, and tampering with his Ministers to compass their ends; urging all the specious Mo∣tives in the World, and sparing neither present Advances of Money, nor the most Magnificent Promises of future Ac∣knowledgment; but finding still a great Resistance to any such Overtures; they at length resolved to play their Game
another way, and employ'd their Emis∣saries in Holland, to stir up those Peo∣ple to provoke the King's Resentments by all the ways that Artful Malice could devise; they caused him to be represented to them as a mean Spirited Prince, drowned in Pleasures, and by them Bank∣rupt; and that would put up any Affronts, rather than be weaned from them a Moment. That slender courage he had, be∣ing Cowed in the last War, as likewise were the Spirits of the proudest Merchants and Seamen, his Subjects, under such an Unactive Prince; adding moreover, that to their certain knowledge the Duke of York was now a Papist, tho' in hugger mugger, and that the People had a strong suspition of it, how clandestinely soever carried, and had thereupon con∣ceived such an implacable Jealousie against the Duke therefore, and against the King himself on his account, that they would never patiently brook the Command of the one, nor heartily assist or fight for the other, in a War against a Protestant State; but break into Factions, and rather abet them, then support so Unwarlike, so Unfortunate, and what was worst of all, so Popishly affected a Prince: that therefore now was the time to give that finishing stroak, to that so Great, so Glorious, and so Advantageous a Work to their most Puissant and Renowned Repub∣lick,
which they had more than half done in the last War, under the favour of the most Powerful Assistance of their great Master, Viz. to obtain for ever the dominion of the Seas, so highly con∣tended for by the English, and ingross the whole Trade of both the Hemispheares to themselves; And that in so Glorious an Undertaking, As the Great Monarch of France had, when in extremity, most op∣portunely and successfully assisted them in the preceding War; So he was deter∣mined to do in this, not with a few Auxilliary Troops and Ships as before, But with his whole Force; being resolv'd of nothing less than to concur with their High and Mightinesses for the Absolute Conquest of that Queen of Islands, that had so long domineered over the Sea, and pretended to give Laws upon that Element, which God and Nature had left as free as the Air it self. And that their High and Mightinesses might enter into no Umbrage of his designing any Greatness to himself, that might be prejudicial to them by such a Conquest; he was content to share it with them, and that so Parti∣ally in their Favour, that he would sa∣tisfie himself with the two Poorer King∣doms of Scotland and Ireland; the former for the sake of its Ancient Alliances with his Kingdom, and the latter because of the Conformity of the Religion of its
native Inhabitants, with that of his own Subjects; leaving to them the Prin∣cipal, which was England, where all the Chief Trade, Riches and Power, both by Sea and Land of the Brittish Empire, was concentred together, with all its good∣ly dependances both in the East and West Indies, with which he could not pretend to meddle; the success of which Proposals I design shall be the subject of another Letter with the first opportunity, From My Lord Your Lordships most Humble Servant. Paris Feb. 28. 1677. N. S.
LETTER XX. The Dutch upon the foresaid Remonstran∣ces made to them by the French King, be∣ing induced to enter into a Treaty with him, were wheedled by the French Embassador to sign their part of it, and to send it to the French King for him to sign it; but he pretending specious delays, sends it to the King of England, using it for an Argument for his compliance with the Proposals he made to him of entring into a War in Conjunction with him against the States: But ordering his Embassador withal to acquaint him, that in case of his Refusal, he must be obliged to turn the Sham-League with the Dutch into a real one. My Lord, THE Specious Remonstrances, and moe Inviting Proposals made on the French King's part to the Dutch, as men∣tioned in my last to your Lordship, so tickled the Hogens, that they suffered themselves to be deluded into a close Trea∣ty with the French Court for that great
Expedition; not at all thinking what Ru∣ine was designed themselves, and Divi∣sion of their own Territories between the French and English was then Modelling among the Monsieurs, as a further tenta∣tive to induce our King to arm with France against Holland; and that the very League the French pretended to be making with them, was but the master Stratagem to procure that other Allyance, that with∣out the unexpected and timely interposition of Divine Providence had proved the Mene-Tekel of their Flowrishing State, and turned that great Magazine of the Trade and Riches of the Universe into a sorry bank of Lillies; accordingly they began first to insult our King in his Person, by multitudes of most scandalous and insupportable Pasquirades and Pictures, which the French Agents endeavouring to make him resent as they deserved, and finding still that he declined to comply with their desires; alledging again for An∣swer, the ill success of the last War, cau∣sed chiefly by them, the averseness of his People to another War, &c. And farther, his unwillingness only for Injuries that per∣sonally concerned himself alone, to engage those Nations again in so bloody and de∣structive a War, as after all could be of no very considerable advantage to either side, be the event what it would. They pro∣ceeded then to tempt him further by of∣fering
a larger proportion of those Pro∣vinces when Conquered; and besides, such an assistance in Money, as should enable him to go through with the War, tho' his Parliament should deny their Concur∣rence with him therein; and to make their perswasions the more effectuall, they did again warmly ply the Duke of York, attacking of him on the blind side, Viz. his Religion, and telling him, that tho' he were privately a Catholick, yet the Peo∣ple began to have a strong suspition of it, and would at long run come to know it, and would not fail then to make such strong brigues against him, as that they would certainly put him by the Succession; unless before such a Discovery were per∣fectly made, he could induce his Brother to joyn his Arms with those of his Most Christian Majesties, for the Conquest of Holland; where were the Vitals that Ad∣ministred Life and Spirits to all those Factions he had to fear, and which after the Conquest of that United many-headed Hydra, would soon be supprest, ut could be by no other way: and that then the introduction of the Roman Religion in∣to these Kingdoms, whenever he should succeed to them, would be easie, else im∣possible; that his Most Christian Majesty was then provided with such formida∣ble Forces, and had laid the Empire into such a Sleep of Security, and so amused
the other Neighbour Princes, with such doubtful and contrary appearances; that be∣fore they could awake, and rub off the dust they had thrown in their Eyes, they might have done their work on the Hollanders, who least of all the rest expected an Attack, and were therefore unprovided. The Duke for∣ward enough before, but now quite over∣come by these pretences, became their most earnest Sollicitor anew to the King; but tho' he neglected nothing in that case, that a Prince of that great influence over his Brother could do, to bring him over to consent to the Measures concerted between the French and him; He found him still inflexible and averse to a War, not out of any disaffection to the Cause, but out of a love to ease, and a Principle of Fear, as I have formerly hinted to your Lordship: Upon which the French Council proceed∣ed to their last Master Stroak in this busi∣ness, resolving in case they succeeded not therein, in spite of all hazzards to take the opportunity of joyning with Holland, to Invade and Conquer England, if possi∣ble. To this end they had all along ma∣naged a close Treaty with Holland, even while they were endeavouring one in Eng∣land, by the powerful Negotiation of their Friends the De Wits, and Lovestein Faction: So then still the more to rouse up our King's Resentments, or to Force him, to make appear to the World, that he had indeed
none, neither for his own Royal Dignity and Honour, nor for the Honour or Interest of his Relations and Kingdoms, nay not so much as a sense of the preservation of any of them from Dangers, tho' never so visible, so present, and so fatal to all and every of them; they put the De Wits on all the ef∣forts they could to keep down the most An∣cient and Illustrious Family of Nasaw, un∣der the specious pretences of the danger of the Liberty the Commonwealth might one day run from the suspitious Greatness of that House, so well deserving of them; especi∣ally, if ever it were so Fortunate, as to mount the Throne of Great Britain, their incompatible Rival in Naval Power and Trade; and with whom, by reason of their near Relation to that Crown, that House could not but by Inclination and Interest, have such a Correspondence as must needs render it imprudent and unsafe in the States, to admit the present Prince into the same Honours and important Charges in that Juncture, which his Ancestors, in the Infancy of the Com∣monwealth had enjoyed and exercised, so much to their Advantage; and accordingly what Steps were made by those two Mini∣sters, to keep the Prince of Orange from the Possession of the Ancient Honours and Priviledges of his House, is too well known to need mention. Which Design being thus set on foot by those Ministers, the
French still the more eagerly to incite them to pursue their Point, insinuated to them; That the only way to expect the full Ac∣complishment of their Desires in the total Destruction of that Family, would be to cause a new War to be declared against England, upon the plausible Pretences and Encouragements before mentioned; in which Juncture the People of Holland, who in the Prince his Fathers time, had begun to conceive an Umbrage of that Family would be the more easily brought to con∣sent to what remained, to the utter De∣priving and Disinabling them to aspire to any Greatness that might be above their Pity: and that by the potent and auspicious Assistance of the French Monarch in that War, the States coming to overpower so gloriously their Rival in Trade, and to acquire a Possession of so great a share of the British Dominions s was projected be∣tween them, and as they would in all ap∣pearance under the Eavour of that pre∣sent Conjuncture, not fail to attain to; they the De Wits by procuring the States so easonable and powerful an Assistance, and pushing them on to a War that should end with so much Glory and Advantage to them, would quite ulipse the great Ser∣vices and Merits of the Nassovian and O∣rangian Heroes, in the earlier Years of the Republick; and give the said De Wits op∣portunity by degrees to raise their own Fa∣mily
to the same, if not much greater Ho∣nours and Priviledges, then those that had been so long enjoyed by that illustrious House; in which, addeth they, you may be assured, that from time to time, you shall never want the friendly Offices, and most efficacious Assistances of our invinci∣ble Monarch, who is no less Constant, Ge∣nerous, and Magnificent, in his Resent∣ments towards his Allies and Friends, then he is Formidable and Inflexible in those to∣wards his Enemies. In fine, they soothed these miserable ambitious Ministers to that degree, and acted that Sham-Treaty with Holland, by their means so to the Life, that the States not doubting but they were in earnest, made all the forward Steps ima∣ginable towards the Alliance proposed, and began to Arm by Sea, not minding how careless a Posture they left all their Places by Land, as dreaming of nothing from France but Friendship and Assistance. And accord∣ingly that Faction having with all the Heat and Diligence imaginable, concerted and con∣cluded a Treaty with the French Ambassa∣dor, he like a sly Gamester, wheedled them to sign their part in it, and sent it forth∣with as privately to his Master; who, said he, would not fail immediately to answer them with a Counter-Change; telling them, that by this means, they should shew a great deference to his Dignity, and the Figure he made in Europe, and testifie their great
Confidence in him, then which nothing could be more obliging to a Crowned Head, especially to him, who much more then any other Prince, valued himself upon his Honour and Integrity: and besides, would contribute much to the success of the great Enterprise they were joyntly to go upon; because by this means their common De∣sign would be most dexterously concealed from the English Court, whom his Master, said he, amused all this while with a sham-Alliance, and hopes of making Peace with you for them, &c. And so keeping them from Arming for their Defence, and so afterwards be executed with such a surpri∣sing Celerity on them, that they should sooner see the Dutch Fleet on their Coasts, and the French Troops on their Land, then hear of them. The Stratagem took, and the Instrument of the said Treaty was with all expedition sent ready Signed by the said Faction, to the great Monsieur, who promi∣sed speedily to answer the Ceremony on his side: And now the De Wits and their Party were Cock-a-hoop, and were alrea∣dy in hopes, sharing their part in the pro∣jected Spoil and Division of the English Monarchy; when the more politick Mon∣sieur having brought them into the Snare he had laid for them, instead of sending back and Signing a Counter-change of the said League to them, sent it secretly to his Embassador in England, with Orders pri∣vately
to shew it our King, that he might by that be convinced what advances, the People he was so hard to be perswaded to wage War with, had made to attack him and his Kingdoms, as they had alrea∣dy insulted his Person, Honour, and Re∣lations. And how affectionate his Master was to his Majesty, who was ready to de∣part from all the Advantages he might pru∣dentially hope to reap by such an Alliance, in that disadvantagious Posture of the Bri∣tish. Affairs, and rather inclined to joyn with his Majesty against those sawcy Re∣publicans, and sworn Enemies to all Crowned Heads: Ordering him withall, to tell him, that the Obstinacy he perceived in his Majesty, in refusing to vindicate his own, his Families, and his Kingdom's Honour and Interest against them, had prevailed with him, to push on a Treaty with them so far, as to get it, by Address, Signed by them afore-hand; that he might have wherewithal to give his Majesty an undeniable Proof, both of their malicious and dangerous Intentions, and of his own sincere Inclination to his Majesty; and delude them into a security, that might hinder them from providing for any De∣fence by Land, against the Forces he had ready to pour in upon them; in case his Majesty would please, while it was yet time, to joyn with him. And further, to add, that for his part he had not Sign'd it
yet, but was ready to Sign one much rather with his Majesty, and would on that con∣dition so protract the time with delatory Answers and Excuses, that their present Naval Preparations should be eluded, and they attacked, when they least expected, and when his Majesty might have time enough to make sufficient Provision, to se∣cond him therein by Sea, to both their certain and glorious Advantage: And lastly, ordering the said Ambassador in the close to tell his Majesty roundly, that tho' indeed he had carried on that sham League for the Reasons afore-said, viz. For the Interest of his Brittish Majesty, as well as his own, for the better conviction of him, of the Necessity, as well as Convenience of joyning with him, and lulling the E∣nemy into that security, that was necessary to the Success of the Arms of both Crowns; yet if after all these steps, his Majesty would still persist to be deaf to his own Interest, so visibly and plainly made out to him; that truly his Master then would be forced to decline those of his Majesty, take new Measures consonant to his own, and in a word, turn the sham Alliance into a true one, by immediately Signing and Coun∣terchanging it; and at the same instant, joyning with those Enemies against him, without giving him time to make any to∣lerable Preparation, that might enable him to weather their first Attempts; for
that it was his Masters undoubted Interest to keep great Forces on foot, and not to keep them idle: And that therefore if the King of England would not joyn with him, to employ them where he had most Inclination, and much Interest too, to em∣ploy them; he would be forced by Inter∣est against his Inclination, to employ them against him, being resolved to employ them some where; and so the Ambassador con∣cluded his Harangue, as I shall conclude this Letter, having been tedious, I am afraid, to your Lordship; and so remain, My Lord, Your Lordships most humble Servant. Paris, March 19. 1677. N. S.
LETTER XIX. King Charles II. being at length brought over to a Compliance with the French Intreagues, and to make War upon the Dutch; the French Council make all the Alliances they can among the German Princes, &c. and where they could not prevail, use their Endea∣vours to perswade to a Neutrality. My Lord, HAving in my last to your Lordship, set forth the successive Intrigues of France, to bring our King into their Inter∣est, and to come to a Rupture with the Dutch States; their Artifices, especially the last (as how could it choose, unless he had been indeed the Log, he has been resembled to) wrought so effectually with him, that he then, without Reluctancy, consented to the French King's Overtures; and an Alliance was, tho' very privately, concluded on, wherein were inserted Ar∣ticles for a projected sharing of the States Dominions, already Conquered by our Ar∣my, as we had been before by theirs; and now both Courts concert Measures to con∣tinue the Amusement of the Enemy, and
to gain some other Neighbours into a Con∣currence or Neutrality. The French King after some Demur, to gain time, and to finish his Intrigue in England, had no sooner concluded it, but after his usual way of Dissimulation, sent back the Instrument of the Treaty with Holland to the States, but with such Additions and Amendments, as he knew would take up time to debate, tho' couched in most suggred Words, and backed with large Promises, of continuing and augmenting Friendship: And having in the mean time gained the Elector of Cologn, the Bishop of Munster, and some others on the Rhine, partly by Money, and partly by deceitful Pretences to joyn with them: They had also the vanity to attempt (tho' the very Thoughts of such an Over∣ture, were charged with insuperable Difficulties) to delude the very Spaniard, if not into a Compliance, yet into a Neu∣trality with them, while their Forces should be acting such Tragedies, as were intend∣ed in their view, and not without passing through their Country, they having such Creatures and Factions in Spain, as they much confided in; but after all their Wheedles and Intrigues there, they found such strong Opposition made by the Queen-Mother, who was a great Enemy to France, as gave them little grounds to hope for any great Success in that Negotiation; so that they began to content themselves with what
they thought they were sure of, viz. By gaining of so much time, in keeping of Matters in suspence, both in the Spanish and Imperial Councils, who were naturally slow enough in their Deliberations, as might suffice them to accomplish their de∣sign upon Holland, before they could be in a readiness to hinder the finishing Stroke; (If so be, they should declare for the States against them, as was to be suspected they would) after which secure of Success, they concluded they should be in a condi∣tion to attack, rather then to expect the whole Austrian Force, tho' fortified with the Succours of all the rest of Christendom: My Lord, I am not at present furnished with the Topicks they went upon, to bring the Spaniards to a Compliance in this Mat∣ter; but I hope I shall be able to give your Lordship a good account of them in my next, which shall be with the next conve∣niency, but in the mean time, I am, My Lord, Your Honours, most humble Servant. Paris, Apr. 15. 1677. N. S.
LETTER XXII. Coleman being engaged in the French Interests, here follows the Topicks he went upon, to induce the Spaniards to a Neutrality in the War in 1672. My Lord, THat the French Ministers are Gens au∣dax omnia perpeti, is very manifest, by what I have written to your Lordship before; but to be so adventurous, as to form Topicks for the engaging those in the Spanish Interest, to favour their Designs, by deluding that Nation to a Neutrality, seems to be a Master piece of their Policy, as well as Audacity: Having therefore gain∣ed Mr. Coleman, whom they judged of any other, the most proper Instrument to carry on such a Design, they formed the following Topicks for him, the better to help him to compass it; and he was to urge closely. 1. That tho' his Britannick Majesty had been by the intollerable Insolencies, and base Outrages of the Dutch Nation, con∣strained and necessitated much against his Inclinations, to depart from so much of the tripple League, as concerned the Hol∣landers;
yet he would not fail to retain still, his Inclinations to promote as much as lay in him, the chief Intent and Pur∣port of it; which was in Substance, to hinder the French from aggrandizing them∣selves, to the Diminution of their Neigh∣bours; but more particularly to the Pre∣judice of the Catholick King, during his Minority, provided he would stand Neu∣ter. 2. That his Neutrality would be a firm Security to him, of what he yet possest in the Netherlands, by obviating, and taking clean away from the French, all manner of pretences to molest his Subjects. 3. That the destroying the Hollanders, who were base Rebels to him, (and whom it was as much Scandalous as Pernicious, for any Crowned Head to suffer to flourish and prosper in Wealth and Greatness, as they had but too manifestly done, to the Di∣minution of their Neighbours, and much less to abet) would be highly Beneficial, and of manifold Advantage to his Catho∣lick Majesty. For that the vast Trade of Amsterdam, and other great, populous, and flourishing Towns in Holland, and the other Provinces, being ruined and depopulated; many of the Inhabitants, at least all those of the Roman Catholick Religion or Per∣swasion, a great many of the Deists, and other Adiaphorites, who were very indif∣ferent and careless, whether they frequent∣ed
any publick Worship at all, or no, but chiefly, and above all other things, ador∣ed Trade and Gold, with which the Dutch Territories swarmed above any other Na∣tion, either on this, or the other side of the Hemisphere, would, without all doubt, refugiate themselves, as being nearest, and most commodious for them, in the Spanish Territories and Provinces, especially Flan∣ders; and would quickly multiply and en∣crease in them, not only People, but Trade and Riches, from whence, encrease of Power and Strength, both by Sea and Land, would be a necessary and infallible Consequence: And that then, the now al∣most abandoned City of Antwerp, once the most famous, and most flourishing City in Trade, of this part of Europe, should have free liberty to lay open her Scheld again, now damm'd up by the Hollanders; and recover her former Riches, Glory, and Strength, as would necessarily all the other Spanish Cities, and trading Towns in that Country, in a proportionable degree, which would be a means to make Spain herself become much more Flourishing and Po∣pulous. 4. That the Crown of Spain would by this means, have her Hands quite rid of the most troublesome, as well as dangerous Rival, in Trade and Conquest in the East Indies, of any other Europian Nation what∣soever; in which respect, neither England
nor France, tho' trading Nations, as being Monarchies, had not been, nor indeed could possibly be, or become so prejudicial to it: However, they might, perhaps afterwards, be fortified with new Accessions of Strength and Power; as that one single Republick, which, tho' scarce of one age's Growth, had yet already, to the Amazement, as well as Detriment of their Neighbour Nations, and especially the Kingdom of Spain, and Territories belonging to it, monopolized into her own Hands, the advantageous, and incredibly gainful Trades to the great Kingdoms of China, Iapan, and many o∣ther Parts, both of the East Indian and A∣frican Coasts, whither in former times, no other Nations in the World, besides those of Spain and Portugal, had any manner of Access. 5. That the Power of that upstart Re∣publick was already at that exorbitant Great∣ness and Grandure, that there was no pos∣sibility, either of humbling or depressing it, and much less of a total Subversion of it, by any other in Christendom, then the united Powers of the Kingdoms of Eng∣land and France; and yet things were brought to that pass, that if timely care were not taken, to have the said Republick removed out of the way, or at least mor∣tified to a very great degree; it must of necessity, in a short time rise up, as Old Rome did, to such a prodigious Strength,
Power, Dominion, and Grandure, that it would give Law to all the Crowned Heads in this part of the World; and per∣haps, at last devour them, since it well appeared, and was conspicuous to all that did not wilfully shut their Eyes, that by such little Blows as the Kingdom of Eng∣land alone was able to give them, in the late War, and Sea Engagements they had with them, their Experience, numbers of Seamen, Power, Strength, and Riches, were every day advanced and encreased, after the Respite of a small breathing time of Peace: And that consequently, if his Catholick Majesty, the King of Spain, or rather the Queen Regent and Ministers, as also his Imperial Majesty should suffer them∣selves to be so over-ruled by such a need∣less, as well as unseasonable Jealousie, so far, as by their Interposition to obstruct and hinder the now probable Downfal of that usurping, and encroaching Republick, what could they expect and hope for in the Revolution of a few Years, but to see those very People, whom, by their need∣less Solicitude, they had saved from De∣struction, be so adventurous, as to seize into their own Hands, by way of Retali∣ation for their Kindness, their precious Mines of Gold and Silver, in the Coun∣treys of Peru and Mexico; when it should be quite out of the Power, either of the Kingdoms of England or France, or indeed
both of them together, should they find themselves so disposed, to prevent their in∣evitable Loss, which would be not only a most pernicious Blow, but, as might very well be feared, even a deadly one to the illustrious House of Austria, as well as a very sensible one to all the other Princes and States of Christendom: And therefore it could not but be a matter even of high Importance, and greatly for the Interest and Benefit of his Catholick Majesty and his Subjects in general, for him to resolve to remain and continue neuter, in this War that was to commence shortly against the united Dutch Provinces, and to connive at, and give way to the Success of the French and English Nations; since it was evidently as necessary and requisite, for the Safety and Grandure of the Kingdom of Spain, ut deleatur ist a Carthago, as it was for that of England and France; from whom a mutual Jealousie, which, as it ever was, could not but be still continued, would sufficiently secure Spain to all future Ages, from offer∣ing any such Violence, or making any such Attempts on their Golden, and Sil∣ver West Indies, as would certainly, as well as unavoidably, be made in less then half an Age upon them, by the Republick of Holland; If his Catholick Majesty, the Em∣perour, and his other Allies, should stand so far in their own Light, and become guilty of so much Imprudence, which
could hardly be thought of them, as to give any divertion unto, or otherwise in∣terrupt the only Powers in Christendom, that were able to prevent that Disa∣ster, and render it quite of none Effect. 6. That his Most Christian Majesty Lewis the XIVth of France had solemnly engaged to his Britannick Majesty the King of England, that upon the Condition of a Neutrality agreed by Spain, he was willing to relinquish all pretensions to the remain∣der of the Spanish Netherlands, and all the other Dominions of Spain, and to get that same Renunciation Signed and Ratified by the Dauphine his Son, as well as by him∣self; and to leave no room for any future Jealousies, even by the consent and approba∣tion of the Three Estates of his Kingdom, whom he would take care to Assemble for that very end and purpose, as also by the Parliament of Paris; that so all occa∣sions and pretences of any future War be∣tween the Two Crowns of France and Spain might be entirely and totally cut off by this one Amicable and Advantageous Con∣cession; nay, and that rather than fail in this particular, his Most Christian Majesty would be brought to re-deliver to the Catholick King, even all the Towns, Cities and Ter∣ritories taken from him by France in the last War, and keep strictly to the other, as well as the Pyrenaean Treaty which was as much as the Spaniards could wish for themselves
or had upon any occasion insisted upon. 7. That the French King would be pun∣ctual to give such strict Orders to his Troops and Armies, that in all their March∣es through the Countries belonging to the King of Spain, they should be so far from being injurious and burdensom to the respective Inhabitants of them, that they should receive very great benefit and ad∣vantage from them, by their exact and libe∣ral paying for what ever they had of them, and that he would afterward leave such a firm barrier on all sides the Country, as should for ever secure them from all Apprehensions of encroatchments from France or any other Neighbouring Nation whatsoever; and that by this means the Spanish Territories would remain very fer∣til, and be filled with Money and all sorts of Rich Commodities, whilst the United Provinces would be run down, and never be in a condition to molest or annoy them more; and what advantage and security that would be to them, they themselves could tell, and a remembrance of former experiences in that kind, must needs cor∣roborate and add strength to the same. 8. That there was no just cause of Jealousie to be entertained, or any great Reason to fear the growing greatness of the Kingdom of France upon such an occa∣sion, for that the accession of strength, which by such means might in some de∣gree
happen to her, would be much more than ballanced by that which would accur to England; by which his Britannick Ma∣jesty would become a much more power∣ful Assistant to Spain and the Spanish Ter∣ritories, against any Violations of Treaties that might afterward upon any account whatsoever happen to be offered by the French, then he could be at this juncture of time, even tho joyned with the Repub∣lick of Holland; and yet rid the Catholick King even at the same time of such a dishonourable as well as dangerous Ally as Holland was at present, and which would certainly prove within a small Revolution of Years a destructive Enemy also, if they were not now in this favourable nick of time obstructed and throughly pre∣vented. 9. That the King of Swedland who was the other Crowned head that had en∣gaged himself in the Triple Alliance for the protection and security of the Spanish Netherlands, was likewise of the same mind and disposition to remain Neuter in the present case, unless he were provoked to joyn with the French and English; But that however he would at the same time joyn and sincerely concur with his Britan∣nick Majesty for the guaranty of this desired and useful Neutrality with France; that both Kings would be ready to enter in∣to a League Offensive and Defensive, with
the Crown of Spain to assist the same with their full force and whole power, against any manner of infractions that should happen to be made, or fall out against this or any other former Treaty or Trea∣ties on the part of France whatsoever. 10. And Lastly, That the French King was ready and willing to accept their guaranty and not only so, but freely to per∣mit the Emperor of Germany and other of the German Princes, that could be brought to stand Neuters, and were willing to enter into the same, to be made Partners there∣in; that all the World as well as the Coun∣cil of Spain might be convinced, beyond all suspitions to the contrary of his Most Christian Majesties, as well as the King of England's sincerity in that matter. These, my Lord, were the instructions Mr. Coleman had, and the Topicks he was to go upon for the carrying on this pret∣ty Design; but how far he put the same in practise, that I could never learn; but he was not the only Engine they imploy'd for that purpose, they had their Agents in Spain it self, who did their utmost to ef∣fect this Neutrality of which I may be a∣ble to give your Lordship an account ano∣ther time; In the mean while I am, My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble and most Obedient Servant. Paris July 24. 1677. N. S.
LETTER XXIII. A farther Argument used at the Court of Spain by the French Agents to per∣swade that Nation to a Neutrality. My Lord, TO the Topicks used by Mr. Coleman and other French Emissaries, of which I have given your Lorship an account alrea∣dy to perswade the Spaniards to a Neutra∣lity, they judged fit to superadd, another to be more particularly and closely insist∣ed upon at the Court of Spain it self, al∣ledging that the ruine of the Republick of Holland, was very necessary as upon other accounts, so more especially in that there∣by the King of England, who was so well enclined to the Roman Catholick Religion, and only wanted an opportunity to declare for it, and to have the Glory to Establish it in His Dominions, which had now for above an Age and half groaned under the burden of a pestilent Heresie, would be∣come so much master of his Subjects, that he would be in a condition, without any danger to himself and the Royal Family to introduce the same Roman Catholick Re∣ligion
into his Kingdoms again, which great and glorious, as well as meritorious Work, the Catholick King and those who had the Administration of his Dominions ought to have to heart above all other Interests and Considerations whatsoever, especially since this would enable the Crown of Eng∣land to do Spain many good and friendly offices in the Court of Rome as well as else∣where, and be a means to ballance the French Faction there, when they should take upon them, as they frequently did, to oppose the Interests and Advantages of the House of Austria, as Henry the VIIIth and other Kings of England had formerly done before the Schism broke out, and their Kingdom came to be overspread with He∣risie; But you know, my Lord, the effect this and the former bait and flourishes have had; for Spain after some short disimu∣lation to gain time declared for Holland, on whose fate they well foresaw that of their Netherlands, and the whole Fortune of the House of Austria depended; in which resolutions notwithstanding all the Artifices used to the contrary, they were seconded by the Emperor, who then had his Arms loose, and by some other Princes on that side, whom tho' they fail'd to hin∣der to enter into an Alliance for the de∣fence of Holland, yet they have met since with too much success in rendring their Conjunction as little hurtful to them as
might be, and of which I may in time be able to give your Lordship the particulars, who am My Lord, Your Humble Servant. Paris Aug. 5. 1677. N. S. LETTER XXIV. Of the shutting up of the Exchequer by King Charles II in January 1671/2. My Lord, I Need make no repetition to your Lordship of what the French have done by Foreign Alliances in Germany; by en∣gaging our King to consent to the Second War against the Dutch, and the Topicks they went upon to perswade others whom they had reason to fear would concern themselves in the Quarrel when they saw their Neighbours House set on Fire, to a Neutrality in the case, and more particu∣larly the Spaniards of which, Transactions I have not long since sent your Lordship the particulars; but what ever was done abroad by them for the ruining of the Dutch Republick they were no less industri∣ous in our Nation to put the King (who God knows was but too susceptible of their
Charms, upon such methods as would Bankrupt his Reputation with his own Subjects, and so become an entire depen∣dant upon them for his support. Two things they had more especially in view for the accomplishment hereof, the one was that he should shut up the Exchequer under the pretence of the absolute necessity of it for want of Money to bear up the port the Nation ought at that time to make in the World when their Neighbours were in so formidable a Posture; but they knew well enough and could not but foresee (as I find they have noted it) that he would by such a surprizing and unparallelled Act lose all his Credit for ever of borrow∣ing Money again, otherwise then on the Branches of his Revenue, or Acts of Par∣liament; and would deter the Parliament from venturing to be so profuse and liberal as they had formerly been to him any more for the time to come, upon never so pressing occasions; at least without binding his hands, and reserving to themselves the care of laying out as well as raising any Moneys to be given to him; and what could the consequence thereof be, but that he must be reduced either of being treated as an Underling or a Doge (which they took especial care to infuse into his head) by his Parliaments; or which they aimed at chiefly, to do the French King's drudgery, to have Money to maintain his Pleasures,
and keep up his Dignity and Authority a∣gainst any attempts, which the Jealousies caused by the faults he had too unwarily been insnared into by his false Friends on this side, might so strongly influence most Orders of Men in one degree or other unto throughout his Kingdoms against it, and which he might easily be induced to choose; prefering rather to be a Pensioner, and at the beck of a Forreigner, then the courtesie of his own Subjects, who have ne∣ver refused to support him in what tended to his real Interest and Honour upon any moderate prospect of security for it; but things did not end here. The other de∣sign of theirs was not only in view but close at the heels of Granting a Tolerati∣on of Religion by vertue of his Preroga∣tive Royal, of which your Lordship will hear more in my next, in the mean time I am, My Lord Your very Humble Servant. Paris Sept. 12. 1677. N. S.
LETTER XXV. Of Liberty of Conscience granted by King Charles II in the Year 1671/2, how and to what ends attained. My Lord, IT was not enough for this Court to en∣gage the King to consent to a second War with the Dutch, and shutting up the Exchequer purely to serve their Interest and Designs, but they must put him upon a∣nother piece of State-Druggery, which at the same time, I am well satisfied he was not of himself much averse to, and that was the Declaration of Indulgence to ten∣der Consciences, as they have been plea∣sed to cant it; they knew well enough what severe Laws were in force against all those that dissented from the Publick Church, and some of them fresh enough in memory not to be so soon forgotten, and they knew full as well, that both the Po∣pish and Presbyterianly affected Persons as well as the Prerogative and Republican Party who then began to revive, that were about the King, would greedily promote it, or at leastwise some of all the mentioned sorts, as a means whereby to attain to the ends aimed at by those differrent Factions.
these the Monsieurs took care to influence in their several ways so as to spur up the King not to delay the granting of it; but whatever the several Parties ends were in the obtaining of such a Grant, the intent of France was chiefly to divide us, and so make sure of the other event of their o∣ther Measures; for they concluded then, had the King gained that point without dispute, and the People suffered that dis∣pensing with the Laws to pass tamely and without any interrogating about it, for an inherent Prerogative of the English Crown; that he would be able to keep a firmer Al∣liance with them, and assist them in all their Designs without controul with his Arms, and that he should at long-run be easily perswaded to receive Twenty or Thirty Thousand Auxiliaries to secure his new acquired Authority, in that and o∣ther Usurpations they intended to put him upon both in Civil and Religious Matters, in lieu of the Brittish Forces he should furnish the French King with; or if he should happen to be so weak as to yield up that important piece of Royalty to the Par∣liament; that still by such a diminution of Power he would in time by their pres∣sing more and more upon him, as they had contrived in that case they should, be still necessitated in his extremity to have recourse to their help against the popular Waves, which when their state Eolus's had
blown enough to a sufficient high Sea, they designed to assist him to asswage, for fear else of giving place to the second Re∣surrection of that terrible Monster called a Commonwealth, which they dreaded more then any thing that could have happened in this Western World; the memory of what a terror that late Monster in our Isles had been to them, as well as to the rest of their Neighbour Nations, being yet too fresh to have been forgotten by them; thus did these State Empericks drench us, and brought our Nation under such Con∣vulsions, that without the help of kind Heaven, must end in a total Dissolution, Sed futura nesimus. I am, My Lord, Your Constant and Faithful Servant. Paris Decemb. 16. 1677. N. S. LETTER. XXVI. The Opinion of the French Court con∣cerning the five Persons that made up the Cabal in England in the Year, 1671/2. My Lord, THE Ministers of this Court are not only the most inquisitive Persons in the World into the Affairs of other Courts, but
even into the Persons that manage them, whose Natures, Dispositions, Religion, Natu∣ral and Acquired Abilities, as well as Respe∣ctive Infirmities, they endeavour to sift out to the quick, that so they may use them or shun them as they find occasion; and for this reason it is that they make some Re∣marks upon them in their Minutes as well as upon the Affairs transacted by them; And therefore since the Five Persons who made up the Cabal in England a few years ago, and who your Lordship may remem∣ber were the Dukes of Buckingham and Lau∣derdale, the Earls of Shaftsbury and Arling∣ton, and the Lord Treasurer Clifford, were very distinguishable for the Stations they were in, the Offices they held and the Parts each of them acted in the Government, I find this Character given of them: For the Duke of Buckingham as he was the Kings Favourite, so he really deserved to be so, as being very capable to be a Mi∣nister of State, if his application to business had been answerable to his Talents, if his mind, which was furnished with excellent Endowments had not been distracted with Libertinism which was in him to an ex∣tream degree, and by a love to his Plea∣sures, which made one of those Persons in the World that was fittest for great and solid things, vain and frivolous. Of the Duke of Lauderdale there is little or nothing said, but that he is a great and quaint Poli∣tian,
and no question but he has merited that Character at their hand: Of my Lord Clifford they are as profuse in their Praises, as I doubt they have been too of their Money, saying; he was a Person who wanted nothing but a Theatre, where Vertue and Reason had been much more in use than it was in his Country in the Age wherein he lived, for to be superi∣our to and overtop the rest: My Lord of Arlinton they make to be a Person of a meaner Capacity and more limitted Geni∣us than any of the Five, but say his Expe∣riences supply the Defect, and has acqui∣red him especially a very great knowledge of Forreign Affairs; last of all, they bring in Anthony Ashley Cooper the Renowned Earl of Shaftsbury of whom they say; he was by far the fitter Person of any of them to manage a great Enterprize, and so was as the Soul to all the rest, being endued with a vast Capacity, clear Judgment, bold Nature, and subtil Wit, equal∣ly firm and constant in all he under∣took; a constant Friend but an implaca∣ble Enemy, with many other Expressions, such as his not being terrified neither with the greatness nor the multitude of the Crimes he judges necessary for his own preservation, or the destruction of others, much to his Lordships dishonour, which is a clear Argument he was not for their In∣terest, and for which he is much behold∣ing
to them. Your Lordship will pardon the freedom I take with You, and accept of the sincere endeavours to serve you of, My Lord, Your Honours most Humble and most Obedient Servant. Paris Jan. 12. 1678. N. S. LETTER XXVII. Of the Methods practised by the French Ministers to corrupt our Embassadors. My Lord, HAving given your Lordship some ac∣count of the opinion the French Court have had of some of our Statesmen; it may be it will not be unacceptable to recount to your honour in this place some of those ways they have taken here to corrupt and pervert our Embassadors; And I can bold∣ly affirm that there has been hardly any one Embassador sent from our Court hither, since the Restoration whom they have not endeavoured to corrupt and to get into a private Intreague to traverse not only what he was to Negotiate, but even something of what themselves prest on our Princes by their own private Agents, and on some of whom, I have named one
to your Lordship formerly, they have made very great impressions to our Nations detriment; for matters of main Conse∣quence, were treated of by private Mini∣sters or Messengers between both Kings, which were not as much as mentioned to the Embassadors sent in Publick, who have been on our side sent only for Parade, to Negotiate many times, things whereof the contrary had been most commonly agreed upon especially in private, only to blind by that piece of Formality the Eyes of our Subjects at home, and of our Neighbours abroad; or else to treat about matters of meer Complement or of but ordinary con∣cern; and tho' what has been privately treated on between the Two Kings, or but only proposed was of great Concern to be kept secret, and that for that very rea∣son they knew our Embassadors were not made acquainted with it, yet such has been their Malice and Treachery to our King and Country, as to discover to our Embassadors or Envoys and their Secreta∣ries, such parts thereof as they have thought, being once known to them, would be most proper and effectual to induce our Mini∣sters to enter into a particular Cabal with them for by-ends, and many times to af∣firm things more invidious than ordinary to have been agreed upon between both Courts, which were only proposed; which kind of Communication of theirs had a ve∣ry
powerful influence by the curiosity that is natural to all Mankind, to work upon our Ministers to entertain such a Corres∣pondence with them to the dishonour and detriment of their King and Country; for they have told them sometimes, that not only the Points proposed by the Dutchess of Orleans, but other things of as bad and dangerous consequence for the Subjects and Religion in England, were absolutely concluded on between both Crowns un∣known unto them; and that our King and Duke of York had taken such and such Measures to put themselves into a Condi∣tion to do what they pleased, and that the King their Master was willing to flatter them in such hopes and feed them with a little Money to keep them from taking part with his Enemies; yet that truly at the bottom he had no such Zeal for Re∣ligion nor for the Pope of Rome, as he had not for the King of England's over great Power and Absoluteness in Rule, being things which could not but be prejudicial and very incompatible with his own great∣ness, and therefore he should not fail un∣derhand to favour the People of England in supporting their Liberties and Rights, and defending their Religion, and confin∣ing the Kingly or Regal Power to its own due limits; And therefore if they, Viz. our Envoys or Ministers would serve him in that design, they might assure themselves
they should be well gratified for their Compliance; that there was no occasion to scruple it; since they knew well enough that our Government was but a qualified Monarchy, wherein the Subject owed ra∣ther more Allegiance to their Country than they did to their Prince; And that since their King went about to deal so un∣fairly and injuriously with their Country, as to enter into Leagues and Treaties, and that underhand with a Foreign Prince, contrary to their true Interest, and decei∣ved his Embassadors by transacting things different from, and opposite to what they had received in their Instructions, and trusted not his own Ministers but only Forreigners with his main Secrets of State; it could not be thought any great infidelity in them to deceive such a Prince, and to enter into private Intreagues against such Designs as were pernicious and destructive to their Country, and would be so to the Prince himself, if not prevented in time, with a great deal more matter still more in∣vidious than that, to the same purpose. Such Methods as these, My Lord, I find in the minutes of the Instructions prescrib∣ed from time to time, to those who are imploy'd to converse with our English Em∣bassadors or Envoys, and after-notes do al∣so remark they had success enough with some of them, whom your Lordship may so well guess at, that I need not name them.
However this opinion they entertained of most of the English whom they gained in∣to Intrigue, except it were the Duke of Buckingham and one or two more, that they served them with the same mind, with which they imploy'd them, for this was and is still an usual saying with them, We imploy'd them not for any love we have had to them, or any good we intended them, but only for the Interest and Advantage of our own King, and the Dishonour and Disadvan∣tage of theirs. So they as we believe and have by experience found by most, served us not for any love to our Interest, but to our Money, and with intent to make what we intended for the disservice of their Country turn in the end for the good and benefit of it, or at least to the Factions and Perswasions they themselves were off; I could inlarge much more upon this Head but I have been already tedious and there∣fore I must conclude and remain, My Lord, Your Lordships most Devoted and Humble Servant. Paris March 19. 1678. N. S.
LETTER XXVIII. Of the French Resolutions, to elude any Advantage the English might receive by the War. My Lord, HAving already given your Lordship an account how our King was brought into the Alliance with France, and to engage in a second Dutch War; I shall now pro∣ceed to set forth the insincerity of the French Friendship, and how little Benefit our King was to reap thereby, in case of Success, and the Methods they had to e∣lude him. Tho' their chief Design was to destroy Holland, yet they intended Eng∣land should reap no Benefit thereby, but rather decrease and truckle under them; for that they meant nothing less then the real Performance to our King, of his Share in the projected Division of the Enemies Countrey, as if it had been their Motto, Pereat Hollandus, nec non subsidat Anglus. And therefore they so resolved to carry things on by Sea, as that they seemed to be rather unconcerned Spectators, then Actors for us in any of the Engagements; tho' your Lordship well knows, that af∣terward, when they were left alone with
the War, they could Fight well enough to Defeat the Dutch and Spanish Fleets in the Mediterranean, and bereave that State of their famous Admiral de Ruyter, which was more then ever we in all our Combats with him could effect; For as if the French Dealing had been a Graft of old Punick Faith, they treated us more like perfidious Africans, then generous Romans, giving not only private Orders to the Command∣ers of their Naval Forces, which they should send us at Sea, to avoid as much as was possible, any effectual Fighting for us, but only to observe and learn what Im∣provements they could from us, both as to our manner of Fighting, and the Situation of our Harbours; and in the main, to ap∣prove themselves, not only as Cyphers, but as broken Reeds to us, who were in expectation of great things from them; and this evidently appear'd afterward by their Conduct towards Captain Martel, who for falling in bravely with us against the Dutch, was first soundly checked, and then disgracefully cashir'd for his Honesty and Bravery: and as their Instructions by Sea, to their Officers, was to play the Le∣gerdemain with us in this manner; they gave the like Instructions to their Land Commanders on the Holland side; and par∣ticularly, tho' it had been concerted be∣tween both Courts, that whilst we should attack Zealand, which was the Province
alotted to our share; their General in the Low Countreys should divert all Relief from it, by a great and sudden Irruption into their other Provinces, which in the Con∣sternation they then must needs be put to, he might most effectually do, yet not only their Minutes, but the Event clearly shew∣ed it was the least of their Thoughts, we should have a foot of Ground for our share on that side; for you may very well re∣member, that when our Army was after∣ward actually Embarqu'd for that Enter∣prize, in which in all probability, had he done his part, they had succeeded; yet in that critical Moment wherein he should have acted according to the Lesson given him, he did upon some frivolous Pretences neglect the same, and so frustrated that Expedition, which obliged our Forces with no small Confusion to return back, and Land without attempting any thing: It's most certain, My Lord, and by their Mi∣nutes it doth appear, that they had con∣certed before hand, that in case they met with any powerful Resistance by Land, that then their Auxiliary Squadron at Sea, should act in earnest with us, and vigor∣ously second us in humbling the Enemy; but if they made any considerable Con∣quest in the Dutch Territories, which, ac∣cording as they had laid their Measures, they supposed they could not fail of, then they were to observe the Cautions since
practised by them; for that their Interest required no further, then that we should with as much Damage to our selves, as might be without Advantage to the Hol∣landers, divert and debilitate their Force; but to suffer us to be absolute Masters of the Seas, or of but one Maritine place on the Belgick Shoar, was too great an Error in Pollicy for them to commit; but in case there were an appearance, that our Fleet, notwithstanding their base Prevarications should master that of the Dutch; and that at the same time their Armies by Land made progress in the Conquest they thought themselves sure of, that then they should by their Emissaries, both in our Court and Countrey sow Jealousies, but more especially to propagate a strong Sus∣pition of the Duke's having embraced the Roman Religion, which they were sure would work the same, if not a greater Ef∣fect, then the publick certain Knowledge of it could do; for it would cause such Factions and Divisions therein, and such an Aversion to that Prince, that he should be forced to yield up his Command into other hands, and to alienate them from the Quarrel, that it would most effectually hinder the English Success from passing the Bounds they intended them; and hence would arise such a Disreputation to the King, and such a Dissatisfaction in the Peo∣ple in general, as should conjure up such
devilish Factions, as with all the Art he had, he should never be able to lay quiet enough to leave him at liberty to act any thing considerable against the French Inter∣est; in case he should attempt that way, to regain his Subjects Confidence and Esteem; and consequently would deter him from the very Thoughts of disobliging such a Friend, and quitting such Alliance, of so near, so present, and of so potent a Pro∣tector, as the French King had made him∣self pass with our deluded Prince, against the so much dreaded Practices of the Re∣publicans, which those Emissaries still took care, tho' covertly, to represent in the frightfulest Colours, their most Romantick Inventions could supply them; and so, with my humblest Respects to your Lordship, Concludes, My Lord, Your Lordships most humble Servant. Paris, March 31. 1678.
LETTER XXVIII. Of the Success of the French Arms a∣gainst the United Provinces, in the Year, 1672. Their further Resolves to Elude us, and their Wheedles to induce the Amsterdamers to yield. My Lord, THE States being at length roused up out of their sleepy Security, and be∣ginning to dread, that notwithstanding all the French Wheedles and Delusions, those vast Preparations by Land, and the lasie Movements of their Armies, boded no good to them, did by their Embassador at Paris, who was a Son of Hugo Grotius, offer the French King all the Satisfaction imaginable; But that haughty Monarch had concerted his Measures so well, and thought himself now so sure of his Game, that all their Of∣fers were laughed at. Your Lordship knows well enough, what a bustle was made in England, by Summoning of the East India Company to give an account of the Insults of the Dutch upon their Factories, since the Peace at Breda, (who answered, and gave it under their Hands, that they knew of none) and such other stuff as that was; yet the French King did not think
fit to trouble his Brains with any such Pre∣tensions; but his chief Motive to under∣take this War was, that that State did e∣clipse his Glory, and must be humbled, &c. And accordingly gave his Armies Orders to enter the Dutch Territories. I need not recite to your Lordship, the Success he met with in his Enterprize, and how like a Tor∣rent he carried all before him; how Rhinburg, Dossery, Deudekm, Rees, Wesel, Eme∣rick, Doesburg, Turesume, Nimeguen, Swoll, Daventer, Grave, Arnheim, Skinenschon, Creve∣ceer, fell quickly into his hands; and Coventer to the Bishop of Munster, his Confederate; and the greedy Monsieur now began with an amorous Eye to look upon Amsterdam, which he did not question but to be speedi∣ly Master of, and it was the least of his In∣tension to allow our King any Share or Part of the Repartition before concerted on between them; And tho' it were pri∣vately suggested unto him, by a grave Mi∣nister that attended him, that if he pro∣ceeded any further, he doubted his Con∣duct would be contrary to his Interest, as tending, how much soever he doted on their friendship, to alienate the King of England's Affections from them by degrees, and convert the Confidence he had in their Sincerity, into utmost Detestation; espe∣cially the main Charms, being by the Death of his principal Charmeress, his late lovely and beloved Sister, in a manner dissolved; and
tho' he should be over-awed by other Con∣siderations, as to smother his Resentments; yet it would so loudly awaken the Old A∣version of our Nation against them; that far from being able to continue much longer in League with them, it would be impossible for him, during such a Juncture, and under such Provocations, to contain his irritated Subjects within the Bounds of a stupid Neutrality, or restrain their Fury from recoiling upon himself and the Royal Family any other way, then by letting of them loose upon the French; and suffering of them to wreak their Revenge and long curbed Inclination, in an open and vigor∣ous War on their old Adversaries, to oblige them to regorge those delicate Morsels, of which they had so perfidiously and unfair∣ly defrauded them of their stipulated Share, whilst their Allies and Confederates: Yet, My Lord, Excess of Prosperity, had so blinded the French King, that like the Em∣perour Charles V. of Austria, when he had taken Francis the first, then King of France, Prisoner at the Battle of Pavia, he fan∣cied they had all the World now in a String; and had partly already provided, and partly concerted such excellent Salves against all Inconveniencies of that kind; that as secure, against all Contingencies, or the jadish Tricks of Fortune, whom they imagined to be now fastned with too strong and well-contrived-harness, to their trium∣phant
Chariot, to kick against her Drivers, much less break her Rains; they thought they might incontrouledly play what Tricks they would with the English; tho' to flat∣ter us with the hopes of our Repartition, would be necessary yet for a time, as it would be easie, after the Reduction of Am∣sterdam, and the entire Conquest of those Countreys, both by specious Arguments, to justifie against our precarious Plea their intended retention of the whole to themselves, and to back their Usurpations by force, when once in Possession: As did the Lion in the Fable to the Beasts, who on the plausible Condition of being allow∣ed an equitable Share, had entred into a Confederacy of hunting with his Brutish Majesty; but he, when all was done, mak∣ing himself to be Judge and Sharer, had, upon Alamode Pretences, the Brutish Cons∣cience to take, and by force to keep all from them: And accordingly the French, when they found that on their side Victory advanced not on Tortoise Claws, but Ea∣gles Wings, and saw themselves before ei∣ther Neighbours or Allies were aware, Masters of the best part of the Territories of that distressed State, and with their Swords in their Hands, point almost to the Vitals of it: As they were most sur∣prisingly active, in taking all they could for themselves, most liberal in allotting our Auxiliaries in their Armies, their full share
in the Fatigues of the War, most false to the Faith of our mutual League, by de∣clining in their turn, to second those Ad∣vances we were ready to make to∣wards the like Success; and in fine, most perfidiously busie in casting Rubs in our way, as I have before hinted to your Lord∣ship, to balk, and in planting those Lights to misguide and shipwrack our Designs: So by their Conduct, as well as Minutes, it did appear, that they intended not to stop there, but that after those stupendious Pro∣gresses that favoured their Beginnings: It was resolved by them, to push on their Con∣quest to the utmost, without demurring upon any Points or Scruples relating to us, even into those Parts belonging to our Reparti∣tion; and especially to seize on Amsterdam it self, if possible, before we could reflect on, and much less oppose so sudden an Ex∣ploit; which, Capture alone, they, not without Reason thought, would be succee∣ded with a voluntary Cession of all the remaining Places and Provinces, and with the Accession of the most part of the Fleets, Merchants, and Colonies, of that potent Republick; who would not fail to conceive, partly, for fear of losing otherwise their whole Proprieties in the Moneys and Ef∣fects let by them, in that great Magazine of both Hemisphears; and partly to enjoy the pretended Liberties and Immunities, mighty Priviledges, and other prodigious Ad∣vantages,
with which their Agents contrary to their League withus, had already privately tempted, and had Instructions further, to allure those industrious and thriving People with, to come over perfectly to them, and decline us: Against whom their Emissaries imployed so many Arts, to exasperate those People; That tho' both Enemies, and the French much more formidable then we, to what by them, and all free-born People, was most Prizable, viz. Liberty, Proper∣ty, and Religion, yet the English was at that time, the more hated name of the two, to their depraved Apprehension. And as for our King, they reckoned him so enchanted with the Opinion, both of the Necessity and Integrity of their Friend∣ship to him, and so intent in that confi∣dence on his beloved Pleasures, with a∣nother She-Magitian of theirs new∣ly sent him for that purpose, tempered with the most intoxicating Venom, known to Female Arts, that they never thought he could have any sense at liberty, to mind what they did: and therefore knowing on the other side, there could arrive no distur∣bance time enough from the Empire, to spoile their Game, it thundring from thence yet, but a far off, they were moving with all greediness, their Harpy-Talons, to seize ont his important Prey: And had without all doubt, attained their purpose in the strange and pannick Terror, that at that
time seemed to disable the Hands, and lock up the Senses, of the otherwise couragious and politick Inhabitants of that famous Emporium, had not Divine Providence just in that Moment, by two most unlikely Ac∣cidents, but yet most effectual Expedients interposed between them and Destruction, of which I may give your Lordship some hints in my next; who am in the mean time, My Lord, Your Honours, most humble Servant. Paris, Apr. 29. 1678. N. S. LETTER XXIX. Of the Massacring the De Wits, the Revolution in Holland, and the Resti∣tution of the Prince of Orange to all the Authority of his Ancestors; with Offers made him by the French King, of the Soveraignty of the United Pro∣vinces, and his Rejection of them. My Lord. IN my last to your Lordship, I gave you some account of the Progress of the French Army, in their Conquest of the U∣nited
Provinces; the Resolutions they had taken, both to elude the Crown of Eng∣land of receiving any Benefit by the War, to push on their own Conquests, and Wheed∣les to induce the City of Amsterdam to yield to them: And I have more over hinted to your Lordship, that there fell out two unexpected Accidents at that time, which put a full stop to their Arms; The first whereof, I shall briefly run over to your Lordship; For while the French Armies were ready to seize that important Place, and that every individual Person was in that Consternation, that they only thought of saving their own Families, without other∣wise concerning themselves about the In∣terest of their Countrey; nay, and that without staying for the French King's send∣ing a Summons for the Town to yield, a Council was held in the City, whether they should not go out to meet him, to desire, he would be pleased to take it into his Pro∣tection, as well as all the Inhabitants there∣of; there was very great Danger of their coming to this Resolution; when the Di∣vine Providence wonderfully appeared, by inspiring a couragious Citizen, tho' till then, no very remarkable one neither, whose Name (and perhaps your Lordship ne'er heard it before) was Offe, and ought cer∣tainly to be consecrated to Posterity, so as never to be left out of the Annals of Time; and who was immediately seconded by a∣nother
called Hassenaer, to stand up alone in the dreadful Gap, and with a Voice like a Trumpet, to awaken his dispirited Country∣men out of the Lethargy of black Despon∣dency, with which the cowardly Tyrant Fear had bound up both their Limbs and Intellectuals, and to excite them, as the poor Geese formerly did the drowsy Ro∣mans, at least to make some Defence for that Capital, and Capitl of the Batavian Commonwealth, and not rashly to deliver up that great Palladium, viz. The vast Bank of Riches therein, on which seemed to de∣pend the state of Europe, into the Hand of a Prince, who wanted only Manacles from thence, to enfetter her; and whose Cou∣rage to attack (said the same Citizen, and I have heard the French-men themselves men∣tion his Name with many Elogiums) depen∣ded solely on the Fears, which the Artifices of his treacherous Correspondents within their Walls, more then the Noise of his Armies, had raised among them; and consequent∣ly on the least shew of Unity and Resoluti∣on among them, would sink with their Cause; nay, continued he, rather then fall into the Hands of him, who (however his Emissaries here have represented him slily to the contrary) will assuredly prove a merciless Tyrant unto us, let us call in the Sea it self, whom we shall find a much more merciful Element, to our assistance: And this, my Lord, being seconded by the Dutch
Mob, now astonished and confounded with the loss of their Country by Land, and op∣posed by two the most potent Kings in the World by Sea; they in a Rage, assassinated the two De Wits, as the Betrayers of their Country, and Causers of that same Calamity, and then deposed the States, who they looked upon to be of the Lovestein or De Wits Facti∣on; and then restored the Prince of Orange, now at Age, to the hereditary Authority and Command of his Ancestors; which sudden and violent Proceedings, did more then stun the French King; but after a little recovery, and finding that his Friends in Amsterdam and other places yet unconquer∣ed, were dispossest of all Authority, and that now the Prince of Orange managed all the Affairs of the State with Pensionary Fagel; he made an Essay, to catch the Prince in a Net, he with his Council, had finely spun for him, by proposing to make him Soveraign of the United Provinces, under his, and his Brother of England's Protecti∣on: I never could learn who it was they employed to the Prince upon this occasion, and what Arguments they induced to gain his Consent, tho' they may be easily guest at; they being never entred into their Ca∣binet Minutes; and perhaps it was because they met with such a Success upon the Prince, as they did not in the least expect, whose Answer was, He would never betray a Trust reposed in him, nor ever sell the Liber∣ties
of his Country, that his Ancestors had so long defended, &c. I have not opportunity to go on in the Prosecution of this Subject at present, but hope in my next, to make it up to your Lordships content; and so remain, My Lord, Your Honours most obedient Servant. Paris, Nov. 3. 1678. LETTER XXX. Of the Embassy sent by King Charles II. upon the Advice of the Earl of Shafts∣bury, to Expostulate with the French King, and stop his further Proceedings. My Lord, I Have in my last to your Lordship, taken notice of the Surprize and Indignation the French King and his Council were put to, at the Revolution in Amsterdam, and else∣where in the United Provinces; and how much his Correspondents had deceived him, in as∣suring him, that all was his own in that wealthy City, and that there seemed but that one place to perfect and secure the re∣union of all the Belgick Provinces, that re∣nouned part of the ancient Gallia to his new French-Burbonian Empire (as he was ad∣vised by some to call it) and now to see his victorious Chariot in its full speed, and al∣most at the end of all its Career, receive a check by the resolution of one puny Burgh∣er,
and withall that his Attempts upon the young Prince of Orange proved abortive; however, considering he was Master of all the places round about, and no Power then on the Continent, being in a posture to come to its Relief, and that tho' the Prince of Orange were restored to the Command of his Ancestors, he had as good almost to have been without, in the Posture his own, and the Affairs of the State were then in; and confiding still in the Influence of those of his Cabal within, who were Men of grea∣ter Estates and Eminence (tho' at present laid aside) then that obscure Burgher, and those whom the Mob had advanced to their Offices; and besides, that the little Vigour that seemed to be infused into the drooping Spirits of the Citizens, by the foresaid Re∣volution and Remonstrances, would quickly vanish, and be interpreted as a flash of un∣seasonable and insignificant Rashness, at the sight of his formidable Troops, and disap∣pear like Smoak before the Sun, to whom his flatterers had taught him to compare him∣self; it was resolved, the place should be re∣duced, if not otherwise, by his Arms with all speed, to prevent any interveaning Accidents, that might impede the mighty success: But seasonably came another Adventure, that put a new Spoke in the Wheel. For, my Lord, while the French Court thought them∣selves secure of all things on our side, as hav∣ing in their Imagination, not only lulled the
King asleep, but the five Persons that made up the Cabal that managed him (and in effect, there were four of them in their In∣terests) the fifth Man, who was that renown∣ed Statesman and true Patriot, the Earl of Shaftsbury, then Lord Chancellor of Eng∣land, whose sagacious Head could penetrate deeper then the rest, and whose Eagle Eyes, the Splendor of those Golden Pieces, stream∣ing in such abundance from that French Pha∣eton, and which had blinded so many others in the like Station, could not dazzle, used all his Efforts to rouse up our King from the heavy slumber of Security, into which French Sorcery had cast him; and highly to represent to him in their true Light, the fatal Consequences to his Crown, Dignity and Interest, attending the taking of that City, and the total Conquest of the Hol∣landers, tho' now his Enemies, by any other, at least then English Hands, and above all, by the Arms of France, and constrained him by the Cogency of his Reasons, and vi∣gorous Representations of a speedy and brisk Interposition, prest home with an Im∣portunity, that would admit of no Evasion, nor allow any Repose, but immediately to dispatch away an Embassy to divert the impending Stroke: But, tho' my Lord, by his pressing Eloquence, gained his Point, in regard to the Embassy in it self; yet your Lordship very well knows, that two of the three Persons employed in it, viz. the Duke
of Buckingham, and the Lord Arlington, were deeply engaged in the French Interest, and seemed by their carriage at the French Court then at Utretch, rather as if they had been sent to promote the French Conquests, then any way to obstruct them; and because they knew my Lord Hallifax was honest, they did all they could to oppose his ap∣pearing and acting conjunctly with them, tho' included in the same Commission, in as ample a manner as themselves, under pretence of his coming a day or two after them to the Hague: And when they could no longer keep him from acting, went pri∣vately to the French Camp, under sham-Pretences, and had Negotiations of their own on foot: But tho' my Lord Hallifax's Vigi∣lancy, Constancy, and Resolutions, could not balk theirs and the French King's De∣signs, yet it put them hard to it, and they saw plainly, that it was the King's mind they should desist: However, the French Court never forgot that noble Lord, the adviser of the Embassy; whereof I shall not forget to give your Lordship account in due place; but do intend in my next, to transmit the Substance of the Consultation held by the French King, upon this unex∣pected Embassy; and so wishing your Ho∣nour all happiness, remain, My Lord, your devoted Servant. Paris, June 14. 1678. N. S.
LETTER XXXI. An account of the Council held by the French King upon the Embasie from England, with the resolves thereupon and methods proposed to elude it. My Lord, UPON so ticklish and unexpected an Occasion as was mentioned in my last, a Council Extraordinary was held, wherein the major part after a serious and warm Debate, were for their Kings pursuing his first Resolution, maugre all the Considera∣tions to the contrary, and to venture even a rupture with England, if it could not be avoided otherwise, rather than quit so dain∣ty a morsel, and lose an opportunity never to be again retrieved of gaining a Post from whence he might easily defie all the Force of Europe: But however to carry on things the more fairly for his Reputation, and to accomplish if possible his design without a present War with England, whose Friend∣ship was as yet more convenient than its Hate, they advised him to dispatch away immediately some acceptable and able Mi∣nister to our Court, with store of Allamode Lenitives to that Sore, and to return an An∣swer in the mean while to our Embassadors full of specious pretences and promises of intended advantage to their Prince and Country by that vey expedition they were
sent to diswade, and to tell them that his Most Christian Majesty having reduced his and their Masters common Enemy so low as they now saw them, and such a panick Terror having seized the People even of the Capital City, that if it were made use of in time, must needs make the Town an easie prey to him if he would advance to∣wards it; and so in one Action put a glori∣ous and happy end to the War, to the in∣estimable advantage of the two Kings, and the saving much Time, Blood and Trea∣sure, being unwilling so precious and irreco∣verable an opportunity should be lost both for his Brother and himself of subduing that Seven-headed Hydra of Faction and Rebelli∣on, that Republick so hateful and adverse to Kings by one lopping off with an expediti∣ous blow, for want of complying with so rare an offer of Providence; he was resolv∣ed to follow the Call of Heaven and Victo∣ry; but withal did assure them on the Word of a great King, and the Honour he so much valued himself upon, that his Bro∣ther their Master had no reason to take um∣brage, nor should have cause to conceive a∣ny regret at that demarch of his; for that his reason for attacking it was that his Arms were there ready to lay hold of the oppor∣tunity and their Masters was not, and his in∣tention in taking it, was only to keep it for him till a convenient Garrison might be sent from England to take Possession of it;
when he would with all sincerity render it to him undamaged, and without poling or peeling the Inhabitants whom he should always consider as the Subjects of his Bro∣ther of England and Ally; And if that An∣swer would not content them, than to Re∣ply that what he designed was too necessa∣ry and of too much importance for both Kings, and particularly for their Master, that if he were not imposed upon, or were but rightly informed of his own Interest in that Expedition, he would be so far from opposing it, that he would rather incourage him to it; and therefore could give no o∣ther return to their Instances, but desire them either to wait for an Answer to the Premises from their Master or go home and report what he had Remonstrated, not doubting but his Envoy whom he had sent to England since their coming, would by that time they returned have so well satisfied his Majesty, that he would perfectly acquiess in the Resolutions he had taken for both their Profits, return him thanks for the same, and fully repose in the sincerity he had al∣ways found in him: And therefore assuring himself as much of his Majesties approbati∣on of what he designed upon his better in∣formation of it, he should without losing any time push on his Advantage while he might; and as for the Envoy he sent for England, they advised him he should be dis∣patch'd away immediately upon the Coun∣cils
rising, with the Instructions they should then concert before another Audience were given to our Embassadors, that he might have time to tell his Tale first before any Letters or Advise could come from ours: Alas! said they, this Embassage is none of the King of Great Britain's doings, but a meer force put upon him by the importunity of some Popular Grandees whom he dares not displease for fear of the People; let Your Majesty but send a Sop to them to take off their mouthing, and then ply the King with the usual Flatteries and Protestations and the forementioned preten∣ces of promises seasoned with a little Salt of Peru, and you need not doubt but his Creduli∣ty and Indigency is great enough to swallow the Bait; And as for what he may fear from those Popular Men, it may be suggested that the taking of that Town only will break the neck of their Faction, and when it should be put into his hands, which if he durst con∣fide in a Prince whom he had reason to believe by the uncontestable proofs he had given him just before the War of his inviolable Friendship for him, should be as he promised, it would quiet all mutining Spirits again in a moment; he is, Credulous enough, said they, to believe shams less artificial and less alluring than these, and if after all, our Flatteries should not pre∣vail alone, our Menaces will; for tho' he be a little fearful of the Resentments of his People for cleaving to us, he is more of us, for he fears their Hate, yet durst not trust their Affection,
whereas he durst not provoke our Hate, but trust our Friendship as the only private fence, we have taught him to think he has, against their Discontents; And therefore a final threat∣ning from your Majesty, telling him, if he knows not his own Interest, your Majesty knows it, will hector him out of any stiffness, the fear of them may put him upon against your designs at least: Tho' you cannot with his Embassadors here, you may by yours with him prolong the Contest long enough to gain time sufficient to effect your Work; For those Inhabitants, soon growing out of hopes of Succour from England as well as Germany; they will relapse into a more violent Fit of despair than ever and yield. After whose acquisition it will be easie for your Majesty to banter the English out of their pretences, or should they be so fool∣hardy as to assert them by Arms, it will be easie for your Majesty to beat them off the seas, and make their Country the next Stage of War, when Germany, Spain and Italy deprived once of the Low-Country passages, tho' never so con∣cerned at the Spectacle, would not be able to help them; And therefore your Majesty, continued they, need not be awed by any fear of disoblig∣ing them for taking in what places by Arms or pollicy you can, especially this on which so much depends the Conquest of the rest, which once accomplished, when the English shall de∣mand the share allowed them by the Treaty, and by your Majesties repeated Promises; what plausible banter will it be to tell them, they
have little reason to expect a share in the acqui∣sition of others, who when they might, have made none themselves, but rather have been prejudicial to the Common Interest by their un∣seasonable and unreasonable divisions, of and in which, &c. said they, we have sown such seeds as cannot fail production; and in their great Council of Parliament, &c. That the true purport of the Treaty was only Conditional, allotting each Party such and such a share in the Countries projected to be Conquered, upon sup∣posal that they should attack and subdue each of them their respective proportion; and therefore that it was ridiculous in them to pretend a claim, who had made no Conquest, not so much as of any one place, and had been so far from landing on the Enemy, that they had not done their duty at Sea. And in fine, added they, to compleat the Farce, how spe∣cious a Conclusion will it be, to assure them however that your Most Christian Majesty to manifest to them how religiously punctual you are to your promises, will take no advan∣tage of their failures or their Misfortunes, but provided they will give your Majesty a reaso∣nable consideration for the Expences of Blood and Treasure you have been at in the taking and keep∣ing of them, for them in a tenable condition; you are ready to order them Livery and Seizing of them according to the Letter of the Treaty and your own repeated promises, for which pre∣tended expences, persued they still, your Majesty may instruct your Ministers to demand such
excessive Sums, as you know they neither can nor will disburse. And as for their asserting their claim by a War, after your seizing of Amsterdam that great Magazine of the dead riches of Europe and both Indies, and of Warlike Provisions both by Sea and Land, and the total reduction not only of that Potent Re∣publick of which it was the Head, but likewise of the living sources of Treasure both in the East and West, by making their great Fleet, Mer∣chants, Colonies, and Commerce all your own, which cannot but clear your way to Guinea and Peru; What stomack, said they, can the English after this have, by taking of their Out∣works the Low-Countries, debarr'd from all assistance from Italy, Spain, and Germany, if in their right senses to have recourse to Arms. Alas! what power to attempt any thing but what will move your pitty more then your in∣dignation; nay rather what greater Ambition will be left them than to Court your Majesty by an easie and voluntary submission to receive them as Honourable Tributaries, thereby to re∣tain a shadow of their Ancient Government and Liberty, without incurring the certain desti∣ny, by an impotent and fruitless resistance, of being forcibly reduced into a Province of your growing Empire; to which the Roman Eagle it self abandoning the defenceless Towers of Austria, shatterred both by Eastern and West∣ern Hurricanes, for the better preserving and re-establishing its Ancient State and Majesty, will then be glad to retire.
This may be your Majesties method, conti∣nued they, to preserve Peace a while with England, or stave off at least the War, till your present grand design be accomplished; and these your Measures how to deal with them afterward, in case they suffer you quietly to at∣chieve this important Conquest; But should we be able by no Art to buoy up the King of Eng∣lands Spirits against the head-strong opposition of the popular party about him; nor so much as to delay a Rupture, nor to hinder that violent People from immediately declaring against us; yet all considerations on all sides duly weighed and perpended, it will be much greater and more certain advantage to your Majesty, and of much less dangerous consequence to your Af∣fairs in general to venture a War with them now about a Town, which with all they can do, they cannot assist time enough to rescue from you; and by whose acquisition against their wills you will not only be quit of all their Pretentions, but gain power to crush them too at pleasure; than after you have for fear of them quitted so great a Conquest, to have a War in a little time after both with them and all the rest of Europe, not only without those advantages, but with the greatest disadvantage imagi∣nable, as without setting on work an hun∣dred expensive and troublesome Intriegues you now will have no need off, your Majesty will certainly have then, notwithstanding all pour complyance to them if you quit your present Design, For, said they, suppose upon your
proceeding to the Expedition in question, the English declaring a sudden War against you should cause the Amsterdamers to assume cou∣rage enough to repulse your Arms, how easie were it for your Majesty upon advantageous Terms to clap up a sudden peace with those di∣stressed People, and by returning out of their Country to pacifie all those powers now prepa∣ring against you, and then with your whole Force to fall upon the English with which perhaps too the Hollanders would easily be per∣swaded to joyn theirs, as glad to see themselves delivered so unexpectedly, their old Enemies drawn so genteely into the Snare, and so fair an occasion put into their hands to revenge them∣selves on that Rival Nation for joyning with us against them, with which it will not be amiss however by your Envoy to threaten the English King; Nay and how probable it is that the po∣pular party in England would on that occasi∣on favour the Hollanders to keep down Abso∣lute Power, and to preserve their Religion a∣gainst the aspiring Duke and Popery; all which they strongly feared would have come in at once upon them after the ruine of that Protestant State? At least, said they, how effectual may it be to let you Majesties Envoy add that threatning amongst the rest to the King of Eng∣land. But Alas! continued they, it is but a matter of meer Speculation never likely to come to pass; that any thing the English can do at present should, as the posture of their Affairs are now in, hinder your Majesties taking that
City, whose Richest and Eminentest Citizens being already gained to your Party, the very terror of your Majesties Navy and the appear∣ance of your Forces, will quickly open it unto you; notwithstanding the weak opposition of a Party formed in a tumultary way among a Mobile by a few particular, biggoted Citizens, who at the noise of your Cannon would immediately turn to the other extream and cry out, as loudly for a surrender. And as for the English, said they, our Emissaries have been so busie and so successful at Amsterdam, that it can never be thought, what ever good Opinion they may have of the People of England, that they can be induced to confide so much in their King, whom they have so personally and so grosly affronted in all that can be sensible to a Prince, and whom they know so much Frenchified, as to think he can heartily intend them any good; or that they can expect any milder terms of subjection under him, either in respect of Religion or Property, then under your Majesty; Since they are daily, and by very good tokens assured that he is pri∣vately advanced already towards Rome as far as the other, and waits only the subverti∣on of their Republick to assume every whit as Despotical and Tyrannical a Dominion over his Subjects in both respects as the French Mo∣narch had over his; or in fine, that they had so great an opinion of his Power in that Posture of Affairs as to think him able to rescue them time enough, or remove the French from them
if he went really about it: And consequently that in the great Consternation they then were in, and the little hopes they had of the slow Forces of Germany; and the distrust they lay under both of their own strength and of the Faith and Power of the English, together with the Apprehension they were possest with, of losing the great Riches they had there by an obstinate resistance which they might secure by a timely composition; they would undoubtedly submit upon the first Summons of his Majesty or any famed General of his at the head of a considerable Body of Men, especially when his Majesty should offer them such advantageous Conditions, as they advised him to do, the more effectually to avert them from all thoughts or temptations to close with England, and to pro∣pose to them: That matters of Religion and Commerce should remain in the same state; As also the Priviledges of their Companies, Collo∣nies, &c. That they should have the privi∣ledges of Natives, in all the other Dominions of France, with many other Sugar-Plums; To the exact performance of which it was not to be questioned but they would easily give credit, since to that time his Honour was entire, and had no ways been stained with any gross Infide∣lities, and that the Protestants, then enjoyed no small Liberty in his Dominions. And when you shall be in the possession of the place, all these specious promises need not hinder your Majesty, said they, from seizing however as much of their Treasure as your Interest shall direct you
to take, nor from putting such other restraints upon them as you please, for which they gave him such expedients as were thought proper and necessary for to elude the advantageous and specious Conditions, by which their over-cre∣dulous Inhabitants were to be wheedled out of their precious Liberties. In the last place they laid before him the many and grand Inconveniences, which by letting slip such an advantageous Juncture would unavoidably follows, which they represented, as much more in number, and of vastlier greater Consequence, than those that could possibly arrive from his pursuing it; For, urged they, if your Majesty let go this Opportunity, It will not only be said of you, as of the Great Hannabal, that you know how to get, but know not how to prosecute a Victory, but the same Fate will likewise befall you; This despised and almost oppressed Enemy will recover Strength and Courage, the Ger∣mans and the House of Austria will come in∣to its succour, you must quit your present Con∣quests to oppose them, and your present Allies on the Continent will forsake you; If you be beaten how disadvantageous and perhaps fatal must the event needs be to you, and if you overcome, yet how far will you be from a compleat Con∣quest, or from making that advanced and as∣sured progress towards the erection of a new Empire; as you would do in the taking that one place, whose Gates tho' they belong but to one City, would let you into the Possession of
the most valuable parts of the Earth, and fur∣nish you with the nerves of War, which there∣by would be cut off from the rest of the World. I was not willing to give your Lordship an account of this Consultation by piece∣meals, and that has made me so tedious, who am, My Lord, Your Honour's to serve You. Paris July 2. 1678. N. S.
LETTER XXXII. Of the Confederacy entered into for the defence of Holland, of the Prince of Orange's success against France, and of the Methods used by the French to hinder the King of England to make Peace and joyn with the Dutch, by re∣moving my Lord Shaftsbury from be∣ing Chancellor, &c. My Lord, THere was hardly a Prince on the Earth worse served than our King and paid more, no less than Three Embassadors to make up the Embassy mentioned in my last save one to your Lordship, and yet Two of the Three concurring with the French designes to the ruine of Hollund first, and so consequently their own Native Country next; so that the poor Hollanders, as your Lordship may well remember, were forced to save their Country from the French (who pursuant to the last advise were ready to devour it) by losing it in the Sea, in breaking down the Dikes the last ex∣tremity and the only remedy they had left them; for this gave them time to think of their Affairs, and this first brought the Elector of Brandenburg, then the Emperor,
and at last the King or Queen Regent of Spain, as apprehensive of the common dan∣ger to all of them in general by the French subduing the Dutch Provinces, to enter into a mutual League for their defence; and by their Conjunction, The Prince of Orange who had all this time struggled with the hardest destiny that could be, and lay neg∣lected by his Uncles as if they had no share either in his good or bad Fortunes, recover∣ed several of the Upland Towns in almost as little time as they had been taken by the French, and like another Scipio having joyned Montecucucli the Emperors General in the dead of Winter, and so carrying the War out of his own Country Besieged and took Bon, the Residence of the Elector of Cologn, and thereby did cut off the Comu∣nication between France and Holland; where∣by the French were necessitated not only to quit their Conquered Towns by heaps, but he also opened a passage for the Imperial Forces to joyn the Dutch and Spanish; But tho' neither the sence of his own true In∣terest, nor the Tyes of Consanguinity to the Prince of Orange could induce our King to come to the rescue of Holland, which notwithstanding the Princes brave∣ry and success was still but in a pitiful plight, as having but newly recovered their drowned Country; yet the French had an incurable Jealousie of him, the remem∣brance of the forementioned interposition
by his Embassy was still fresh in memory; And as that fell out when they least expect∣ed any such thing, so they considered a Peace might be struck up in as sudden and surprizing a manner, and therefore they set all their Engines on work to hinder it if possible, and in the first place knowing that great Person who had the influence over the King to procure such an Embassy, and might also by the same Arguments induce him to make a much hardier step, and force him at last in spight of his own inclinations, or of French Menaces, as well as of French Charmes, not only to a Peace with Holland, but even to a War against them; They therefore left nothing unes∣say'd, or stone untur'd to get him to dis∣pose of the Chancellor's place, tho' it was well known the King himself upon a cer∣tain occasion had given his Testimony of his being the wisest Subject he had in his Dominions, and seemed at that time to va∣lue him accordingly: I cannot posi∣tively inform your Lordship, by which of their Instruments it was done, for I never could find it was inserted in the Minutes; but I have heard it generally discoursed at the French Court, that they ploughed in this Affair with the Heifer they had formerly presented the King withal, and that the Duke also whom they by their Emissaries iritated against
him, to whom they alledged that he had taken notice of his keeping off of late from the Protestant Worship, and talked too li∣berally thereof, not without some Expressi∣ons boding much danger to his Highness, and even levelled at putting him by the Succession it self, gave an helping hand thereto. But for all they had gained so considera∣ble a point, as the removal of the Chan∣cellor, yet fearing still the worst, they never left off their former apprehensions; And therefore their Ministers still continued with utmost Application to pursue their Game, both by magnificent Promises and Offers of Money, and some Menaces a la sourdene; but with instructions after all their industry, if they could not succeed in ob∣structing the peace, yet not to fail to elude it, which how well they succeeded in the first for a time, and when that could not be warded off no longer, how much more fortunate success they have had in the latter I shall endeavour to make your Lordship ac∣quainted with at another time, when I hope they may be no less grateful to your Honour's gusto, from him who desires to approve himself to be, My Lord, Your Obedient Servant Paris Octob. 9. 1678.
LETTER XXXIII. Of the Negotiating a Marriage be∣tween the Duke of York and the Princess of Inspruck in Germany; How that Match came to be broke off; and how the French gain'd their Point in Marrying the Princess of Modena to him. My Lord, THings continuing in the same posture I mentioned in my last to your Lord∣ship, between England and France, the latter having the full ascendency over our King and Court, to keep them from the Peace with Holland, and to enter into a War in Conjunction with the rest of the Confede∣rates against them; and the Duke of York happening to be a Widower, who was en∣tirely, as they thought, in their Interests at this time, which was the year 1673. there was an Intrigue started up and carried on, that in all appearance was eady to break the Thread of all their Contrivances, and irrecoverably to overturn all they had been so long and with so much pains about; but another as lucky a hit interposed timely in their Aid, which salved all their drooping
Interest in our Court again sounder than ever, tho' like the Beast in the Apocalypse, it seemed to have received its deadly wound; For when a Negotiation was now not only set on foot, but in a manner concluded, for Matching our Duke with a Princess of the Austrian Family, an Alliance which would certainly have broke the neck of all Leagues with France, and make England once more the Ballance between those two mighty Powers; I say, just when a Match was concluded with a Princess of the House of Austria, and nothing seemed remaining to the accom∣plishing of it, but celebrating the Espousals, and bringing over the Lady into England, to remain the gage of a close and lasting Alliance, between the Royal Stem of Eng∣land, and that Illustrious and Potent House; and the Monsieur at biting his Nails for spite to see his Interest there desperate and past retrieval; it most luckily happened to him, that in that very interim the Empress died, and the Emperor coming to want a Confort, and finding no other worthy his Choice, according to the usul practice of the Austrian Families, whose Branches intermarry frequently with one another, he retain'd the Lady for himself; and so defeating our Prince of his Spouse, and putting of him in a new quest, gave the French an opportu∣nity to prosser him a Female, who they knew descended from a right Intriguing Breed, and would be sure to do their Work
throughly, and thereby not only renew, but make sure against all Events that Alliance that hath since proved so pernicious to all Europe, and so vexatious to the one, as well as to the other of our Princes: This Match they knew might be of great importance to them, not only as to the promoting their Ambitious Ends in England, but in Italy too; and if they could once ensnare the Duke into it, would as fixedly tie him to their Interests, as it would infalli∣bly lose him every where else, and engage not only the Protestant Subjects of these Kingdoms, but even all the other Powers of Christendom, as well of the Roman Com∣munion as the Reformed, to oppose his future Elevation, that so he might be wholly dependant upon them; She being a Lady, not only Italian by Nation, but a Relation of the Pope, (and in that Qua∣lity most odious to England) and also of the late Cardinal Mazarine; and in a word, of a Prince Pensionary to the French, and an adopted Daughter of France; which last Quality they honoured her with, to render her compleatly hateful to all the World, besides most liberally paying her Portion, Pentioning the King, and greasing the Ministers to have the Parliament Pro∣rogued, that in the interim the Match might be huddled up with all the precipitation imaginable, for fear upon the least delay, by contrary Sollicitations from the Austrians,
or any other Potentates abroad, (or any black) and grumbling Clouds at home, the unstable King might be over-persuaded or frighted from letting his Brother go on with that destructive Alliance. These, my Lord, were their Contrivances and Precautions upon this Subject; and they succeeded so well in their Endeavours, that mauger any Reasons the King might have to the con∣trary, or any Opposition made by some few then about him, that Match was concluded, from which England may in a very great measure date the commencement of her en∣suing Grievances; and which, according to the Parliament's Prediction of it, caused such terrible Earthquakes in the three Nations already, and God Almighty alone knows what the dire Effects may be, and where things will terminate at long run, though it may at the same time prove better than our fears. For after it was once done, they cared not what Storms it produced amongst us; for if the endeavours of an Alliance cemented with so charming a Fe∣male, unwearied in enticements, could not allure, nor the suged Professions of a con∣stant Amity and Protection, besides the powerful Spells of continual Supplies of Money, engage sufficiently; yet they were confident the troubles it would cause, would necessitate him for Self-preservation to keep close to their Interests, and to be content perhaps for the preservation of the rest, to
give them part of his Estates, whenever it should succeed, and make them Executors of his Will; or at least, at all Adventures, keep up such Divisions, as by the care they would take to balance the respective Par∣ties concerned in them, would both divert and disable the Nation from exerting their Resentment against them to any great pur∣pose. These, my Lord, were the Improve∣ments they proposed to make by this Match, and herewith I shall conlude, who am, My Lord, Your Lordship's very humble Servant. Paris, Aug. 30. 1678.
LETTER XXXIV. Of the Peace made between England and Holland, in February 1673/4. The Motives to it, and the French Methods to elude it, by retaining the Irish still in their Service, with our Courts connivence. My Lord, I Have formerly taken notice to your Lordship of the Methods and Precau∣tions the French used to keep our King from making a Peace with the Dutch-States; and how they made it their busi∣ness to dispossess all those, and particularly my Lord Shaftsbury, of the King's Ear and Favour, who were concerned for His and the Nation's Interest, by promoting such a Peace; but though they prevailed therein, as well as in that of the Duke's Marriage with a Female of their own chusing; yet my Lord, you know very well, they failed to stem the Tide that broke in as a conse∣quent upon that Vote of the Commons, Octob. 31. 1673. That considering the Con∣dition the Nation was then in, they would not take into further consideration any Aids or Charges upon the Subject, except it did appear the obstinacy of the Dutch should
render it necessary, &c. For the French E∣missaries had taught the King and his Juncto their Lesson, to wit, to give out that the Dutch were full of Sullenness and Obsti∣nacy, and would come to no honourable Terms, and therefore there was a necessity of further humbling of them; but now the Court of England were as hasty to make up the Peace with Holland, as e're they were to declare War against them, which was con∣cluded by the 9th of February, 1673/4 but though the Dutch came hereby to enjoy Peace with us at Sea, yet they found the pernicious Effects of the Valour of the Eng∣lish Troops which continued in the French Armies, and gained them several Victories after that Peace; till upon the earnest and repeated Instances, both of the Foreign Powers concerned, and of our own Parlia∣ment, some redress was given to that Grie∣vance, but never a total one; a Procla∣mation being obtained for recalling our Forces from the French Service, which yet was construed not to extend to the Irish Nation, who after that, by that foul con∣nivence of our King, not only continu∣ed there in Bodies as formerly, but drew over Recruits from time to time, and were most highly cherished and cares∣sed, as indeed were the Irish Nation all along, with a sensible difference above the English and Scotch, especially when a War was expected with us; they having a se∣cret
design upon that Kingdom by one Me∣thod or other, ever since their first draw∣ing our King into League with them; which they did not obscurely intimate, when by way of encouragement they would now and then say to the Irish Roman Offi∣cers among them, as likewise to other qua∣lified Gentlemen Travellers of that same Nation. That the King their Master had an esteem of them above all other Nations, for their Antquity, Generosity, and Invin∣cible Conncy to their old Religion for a∣bove a Century of Years after their Masters, the English had abndoned it, and that the Scots and the Weish Britains, by the conta∣gion of their Example, with sufficient Dero∣gation from their former unviolated Claims to Antiquity and unconquered Liberty, had done the like; and would assure them from him. That the time would come when he would shew them marks of his Esteem, by conferring the Hereditary Guard of his own, and his Successor's Persons on their Nation, instead of the Scots, who were now departed from their Interests; and that as a Catholick Prince, and the Guarantee of their Treaty with King Charles, when in Banishment, for restoring to them their Estates whenever he should be restored, he would see them righted, and would one day free them from the Tyranny of the English Nation.
But notwithstanding all underhand Com∣pliance of our Court with that of France, as our Peace with Holland had already dis∣pleased them, This recalling of our Troops, as partially executed as it was, quite put them out of humour; so that though they durst not shew their Resentments too far, for fear of increasing the Evil they fretted at; yet they did what they could by al∣lurements to debauch, and by hard Usage, and all imaginable Discouragements, both to deter as many as they could of our Sol∣diers from paying Obedience to the said Proclamation, and to disable those who were fixedly bent to return, from being service∣able to their King and Country. Among the rest, mighty Advantages were offered to my Lord Dowglas, afterwards Earl of Dunbarton, to intice him to stay; and some time after he was gone, upon hearing he had no Preferment under his own King, by reason of the severity of our Laws against Men of his Perswasion, there were very great Rewards proposed to those they thought had any influence over him, to perswade him to return, and particularly to my self, in case I could find any who could so far prevail over him; but all in vain; yet most of the Irish remained to the last, and were very serviceable at the brisk Action of Gyrone, and on some other Occa∣sions; and after the fear of the War with us was blown over by the Tempest raised
among our selves, whilst we blinded our Par∣liament and People by seeming to observe exactly the Articles of Neutrality agreed upon between our King and them, they for a long time, and even till now, have refused to receive any English and Scotch Officers and Soldiers to their Service; tho' contrary to their Allegiance to their King and Coun∣try, several of them, and some of them Ro∣mans of tried Affection, proffered themselves, yet still as many Irish as presented them∣selves, were readily entertained. And thus, My Lord, Tho' these subtile Politicians missed of their first point in hindring our Peace with Holland, they suc∣ceeded but too well in the second, through our Court's weakness and base Preva∣rication, which was eluding it, by cor∣rupting our Neutrality, with such a partiality on their side, that it was an Honey-Comb to them, whilst it was but a Spunge of Gall and Vinegar to the Confederates; but foreseeing that in time this jugling conduct of our King would make all Europe murmur, and render his Friendship or Mediation suspicious every where; That it would make him odious to his People, and blow into a Flame those old jealousies that already began to re∣kindle, and afford ample matter for the Emissaries of the Confederates to work up∣on in our Nations, and consequently to actuate our People so violently to a League
with the said Allies against them, that it would be impossible for the King, with Safety, to resist them; (for of his good Will to them, by this time they were pretty confident) they therefore were careful to make a timely Provision against an inconvenience so much dreaded by them, and to endeavour to make use of those very Jealousies, Fears, and Animosities, whose Effects they appre∣hended, against their Adversaries, by dex∣terously catching them up, like Fireworks before they brake, and returning them back upon our selves; and this difficult sort of Game they managed by several Strata∣gems, of which I have neither room nor opportunity to advertise your Lordship at present, but must defer it to a proper season, and remain, as I truly am, My Lord, Your very humble Servant. Paris, July 12. 1678. N. S.
LETTER XXXV. Of the Marquess de Ruvigni, a French Protestant, his being sent Embassador into England; and what the Politicks of France were therein. My Lord, I Do not question but your Lordship does remember the first time of the Mar∣quess de Ruvigny's being sent Envoy from this Court into England, which was in the Year 1669. and which, I think, I have in one of my Letters hinted already; That he was a Person very capable for such an Im∣ployment, none can doubt that knew him; but that ever he was chosen by this Court purely for his Capacity, is not to be admitted of. You know, my Lord, the Triple League stuck then close in the French King's stomach, and that the dan∣ger Religion was in, as well as Property, from the progress of the French Arms before in the Netherlands, contributed very much to the cementing of such an Alliance, which this Court were labouring tooth and nail to break to pieces, and more especially to get the King of England out of it; and to that end, Monsieur Ruvigny's Religion, he being a Protestant, highly recommended him: How well he discharged his Com∣mission
then, I need not recount to your Lordship, the Event has sufficiently disco∣vered it to England, as well as to Holland's sorrow, and to the no small regret of some of those of his own Religion and Fraterni∣ty in France. It was much about Six years after, that the same Marquess was entrusted with another Negotiation at the English Court, to no less pernicious an end than the former, and I fear at long run with worse effects: They had, my Lord, besides the Instruments I have formerly mention∣ed, for some time before this, imploy'd se∣veral of their own Hugonots in England, for the carrying their Intrigues more effectually on among our Protestants, which Hugonots have been the more forward to please and obey the Instructions of their Prince and his Ministers, in that they have believed them very compatible with their own particular Interests; wherefore they have done all they could to contribute to the Elevation of the Presbyterian Government in our Na∣tion, which, because the same with their own, they have naturally had some desire to see established in a Kingdom so able to protect them, and which had hitherto been the great impediment to their extirpation in France. But to return from this Digres∣sion, for which I beg your Lordship's par∣don, to the Marquess de Ruvigny, his In∣structions were to endeavour to possess the Protestants in general in our Nation, which
were now, my Lord, full of fears of some Secret Designs a brewing between the two Kings, in prejudice to their Religion and Civil Rights too, that they needed not to be so much concerned at Appearances; that it was far enough from the thoughts of his Master to make their King great to his Sub∣jects prejudice; and that he was not so zea∣lous for the Roman Religion as they might imagine, whereof he was to urge several instances and to endeavour to throw off all the odium from him upon the Pope and the Court of Rome, and thereby make them level all their Fears, Jealousies, and odious Reflections that way; to the end, that by the Royal Church-Party, who had the King's ear, they might still secure him further in their Interests, and have their helping-hand to carry on those Points they aimed at that way, viz. the hindring the Princesses matching with the Prince of Orange, and the Offensive Alliance so much feared then and now with the Con∣federates, &c. But this was but one Party of the Protestants; his Instructions also were to make a particular Interest among the Dissenters, and such as inclined to them at the same time, that in case they were defeated in the one, and saw no likeli∣hood of staving off the other, they might have them ready prepared to enter the lists against the former; and when War was ready to be declared against France,
to push them on, if possible, to raise a Civil Combustion at home, and to in∣sinuate into them; That the King, his Master, was willing privately to assist them as his Predecessor had done theirs in the late Civil Wars upon occasion, &c. in which sort of Negotiation the Mar∣quis was effectually enough seconded by his Countrymen-Hugonots then in England, and particularly by a man of singular Parts and Learning, and exceedingly well ver∣sed in Intriegue, named Monsieur—but on the contrary, in case they should have been able by the Royal Party to have been strong and successful enough to gain the two said Points, and hinder both the Match and the War, which was their business, and is still in part, to op∣pose; they had Orders to have the same Dissenting Party still ready, when King Lewis, and his Cousins of England, should have had that part of their ends of the Conforming Party, to make use of them against them, if they would not humour them so far as to suffer themselves to be carried quite back to Rome. And because all our Protestants, how∣ever differently denominated, should take no umbrage at any of this Court's Pro∣ceedings, they thought fit once more, to let their Sun, as they so often term him, to cast some warm beams on the Hugonot Party at home, and to entertain them a∣while
with some Courly Smiles, whereby they have designed to amuse our people, and at the same time make their own Pro∣testants to be their Instruments to carry on the Divisions of those, who, while united, are their only Protectors; for hitherto, while they have had War with the Confede∣rates, and chiefly with Holland, and are in fear of one with England, it being yet out of their power to destroy these people, they have thought it their interest not to exaspe∣rate them, whereby they may be tempted to run over to the Enemy; but rather for the present to court them, and make them serviceable unto them, by working in the very Mines which in all human probability are designed to blow them up withal; I will not intrude—When Captain E—returns, I should take it as a singular fa∣vour to receive a line from your Lordship, and particularly your. Sentiments of our Home-affairs, by him, whom I shall expect with utmost impatience, who am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble Servant. Paris, Iuly 20. 1678.
LETTER XXXVI. Of Prince Lobkowitz's being disgraced by the Emperor for Corresponding with the French about the Year 1674. My Lord, YOUR Lordship cannot be ignorant, that during this Intrieguing in Eng∣land, and Canvassing of Designs against our King and Kingdom, the War went on on this side with various success; but I find England is not the only Country that has been bubbled by the French Emissaries, and had its Secrets betrayed; I cannot tell any one part of the Confederates that have been exempted; but Germany more particularly has suffered in this kind variously, but in no∣thing so remarkably as in the business of Prince Lobkowitz's being disgraced some time since by the Emperor, and which has made so much noise in the World, that your Lordship could not but hear of it: That he corresponded with this Court, there is nothing more certain; though when the business was once winded, their Emissaries thought it adviseable to be the first Rumorers of it, but related the same with Particulars so extraordinary, that were scarce credible, that thereby they
might turn the whole at length into a ridi∣cule: But the way of their Correspon∣dence with the said Prince, and others in the Empire, was so intricate to be fa∣thomed, that 'tis no wonder the matter has been as it were dubious in the World to this day; for little did the Councellors of State, and other Princes and Grandees at the Court of Vienna think, that those very Jews who sold them Jewels, Pearl, and other rich Moveables, were wont at the same time to bring and carry Letters to the forementioned Prince Lohkowitz, and other vile Traytors to the Emperor and Empire; and though these sort of Ver∣min have been banished the Emperor's Territories and Dominions, yet for filthy Lucre-sake, to which they are addicted above any Nation or People under Hea∣ven; and to serve the French, whom above any other they value for the Reasons I have formerly given your Lordship upon another occasion, They make no scruple of assuming those Shapes which they out∣wardly would most seem to abhor, and whose Principles they have disbeliev'd above these Sixteen hundred years, I mean Christians, and to this day drive on the old trade. But our private minutes relating to this Country, and which I have had the op∣portunity lately a little to inspect, tell us positively, That at least two of the Empe∣ror's
own Confessors of the Iesuitical Or∣der, the much more dangerous Traytors than any other could be, were guilty of the same Crime. The next year after the Disgrace of this Prince, happened that memorable Success the Emperor's Forces had upon the Rhine against the French; but it is no less memorable after such a signal Victory against the Mareshal de Cre∣qui, &c. that Montecuculi, the Imperial Ge∣neral, should, after he had besieged Sabern, and was in a fair way to carry the Place, so suddenly rise from before it, re-pass the Rhine with his whole Army, and leave the French, after all, wholly in pos∣session of Alsatia, where he might easily have Wintered his whole Army: The World were then, and have ever since been occasionally very busy about the rea∣son of this Action, which is very unac∣countable to this very day; It was whis∣pered then, that Montecuculi was so far from offering to do this of himself, that he had express orders from the Emperor, or at least∣wise from Vienna, to do it, and which he obeyed with a great deal of reluctancy and ill-will; but little have the World thought that it was chiefly the influence which Father la Chaise had over the Em∣peror's Confessor, that produced those po∣sitive, though most noxious Orders; so far the Minutes mention that Affair, and no farther. I would not have troubled your
Lordship with these Foreign Affairs, had I been supplied with any that was dome∣stick; though, I hope, they are not so unacceptable, but that you will freely par∣don him who is desirous to serve and honour you to the utmost of my power, and remain, My Lord, Your humble Servant. Paris, June 20. 1678. N. St.
LETTER XXXVII. Of the French Ambassador's, the Ma∣reschal d'Estrades, and Monsieur Colbert's Instructions, to attack Sir William Temple, and Pensioner Fagell, to engage the Prince of Orange into the French Interests, and to promote the Peace. My Lord, THis Court have left no Stone unturn'd, neither in England nor Holland, in or∣der to the winning of the Prince of Orange over to their Interests; but they have met with more constancy, in him than could be expected from a young Prince of his years, which has plainly manifested him to be an Inheritor as well of the Vertues, as of the Fortune of his great Ancestors; and when they found there was nothing to be done with him directly by any of their own Emissaries, they resolved to attack him in the most sensible part, by the Ministry of two persons whom they knew he as much valued as any other on this side, and they were the English Ambassador Sir William
Temple, and Monsieur Fagell Pensionary of Holland. Their Agents, in this hopeful bu∣siness, were Monsieur Colbert, and the Ma∣reschal d'Esrades, their Plenipotentiaries for the Treaty of Nimeguen, who quickly began their attack upon Sir William, accord∣ing to the Instructions I find they had given them. I. To insinuate slily, what a value the French King their Master had for his Person and Character; and that therefore during the course of the Negotiation they were to enter upon, they had Orders to make their application to him; That they knew how much he was in the confi∣dence of the King his Master, and of his chief Ministers, and therefore how filly qualified he was to put the finishing-stroke to a Treaty he had had the greatest hand to set on foot, and of which he must needs reap all the Glory; That he might reckon very much upon the facility of the King their Master in that weighty Affair, but yet so far still as to have a just regard had to the great Successes of his Arms during the War. II. They were to make a Mien of their being fully possest of the States great for∣wardness to strike up a Peace, which
their Allies must comply with, tho' they might for a time retard it; That there∣fore the only way they could see for to give Europe Tranquillity, was for the Prince of Orange to interpose his Autho∣rity, which was so great with all the Allies, that they were very well satisfied in their willingness to agree to whatever terms he should be resolved on, in pro∣posing the Peace: That therefore in or∣der to bring that grand affair to an hap∣py and sudden issue, it was their Opinion, there was no other or better way for it, than for his Highness first privately to agree with France upon the Conditions, and what each Party's Proposition should be; and when that was once done, after∣terwards, in the course of the Treaty, which was to be supposed, could not spin out to any great length of time, then to draw all matters by concert together to the scope agreed upon between them. III. To seem very confident this Me∣thod would do; but that if it should so happen that the unreasonable pretences of the Allies should obstruct or delay a Ge∣neral Peace, that then the Prince might make use of the usual Temper of the States to bring it to a sudden issue, and make a separate Peace; that if the Prince pursued this method, it would be in his
power to do great things for himself and his Family, for which they were to pro∣duce as many instances as they could of parallel cases; And that as for what con∣cerned the Prince's own personal Advan∣tages and Interests, the King their Ma∣ster had given them full power to assure him, That he might set down his own Conditions, and they should be accep∣ted. IV. That tho' they had many others to, make these Overtures to his Highness, some whereof they were also darkly to intimate, yet that they were to pursue their Master's Orders, which was to apply themselves to none but to him, if he thought fit to charge himself with it; That they were very sensible of the Credit and Con∣fidence he was in with his Highness, and how much deference he had to his Judg∣ment in what concerned the publick In∣terests of the Allies at that time, as well as his own; and that if he would effe∣ctually espouse that Affai, he might reck∣on upon what he pleas'd himself from the Generosity of the King their Master, whose constant Character it was, never to let the least Merit go unrewarded. But if it should so fall out, that Sir William proved stiff in the matter, as it
seems he did by the sequel, they were to turh the same Batteries upon Pensioner Fagel, with a variation of Phrase, and Com∣plement agreeable to the Person and Cir∣cumstances, and more especially to try what the force of the French Pistols might effect that way; And if so be matters were carried so far as that the Prince was found to give any ear to it, then he was to be rounded briskly what mighty things the French King would do for him in relation to his future Greatness both in England and Holland; That for his Prin∣cipality of Orange, he should have it resto∣red to him again, or such a compensa∣tion nigher Home, as he would reckon on himself; as also for his Lands in Burgundy, and any other Losses, Damages, &c. Nay, they were ordered to offer him a very large annual Pension, if he would have complied: But half these things were ne∣ver actually Proposed, because the said two Ministers, and the Prince himself more than any, were as so many , for they would not so much  hearken to the Voice of those dangerous Charmers; A rare Instance, My Lord, to withstand such great Temptations, and not to be parallell'd perhaps in any other young Prince of our Age, as it was indeed also in the two Ministers, many of which En∣gland, at this time, is not over-fruit∣ful
of; I wish it were, our Affairs would have been in a better posture than I hear they are, and I dread much worse to come. I pray God avert it, and pre∣serve your Lordship from all Dangers, which shall ever be upon the Heart of, My Lord, Your Lordship's Most Humble and Most Obedient Servant. Paris, Octob. 19. 1678.
LETTER XXXVIII. A Summary of the French Methods to get the Dauphin made King of the Romans. My Lord, PErhaps since all the noise of the Western World, at this time is the Affairs of Hungary, between the Turks and Impe∣rialists, the particulars whereof I need not trouble your Lordship with; it will not be amiss to look a little back, and remark what influence this Court has had upon this War, and what Designs they have long since hatched under the Covert, not only of this, but all the other Broils they have engaged Germany in; I find by Patin's Let∣ters so far back as 1671. that it was a mat∣ter then not questioned, but that there had been Designs concerted to have the Dauphin created King of the Romans, which made me endeavour after a more particular informa∣tion in that Intriegue, which at last I have found to be inserted in this manner, ac∣cording to the distinct Heads that follow.
I. All the Designs which they had con∣certed in the Wars between England and Holland, for the weakning and destroying them, if possible, as I have already given your Lordship a particular Account of, first terminated in that ultimate end, Of advan∣cing the Dauphin as before-mentioned. II. The former Wars against the Confede∣rates was attempted for the same Ends in a great measure, all their Designs against the Spanish Monarchy having a tendency that way. III. Their unspeakable Pretensions in the Palatinate, on the behalf of Madam, the present Dutchess of Orleans. IV. All their open and secret Practices in Hungary, from Arch-Duke Joseph's being made King there; and by making Over∣tures to another King underhand, John Sobi∣eski by name, to oppose the Emperor therein, promising their utmost Interest to get that Crown and Country conferred on him and his Posterity; rightly judging, that if the Arch-Duke were balked in Hungary, it was not likely he should prevail in Germany. 5. They have now for the same end, their Emissaries in Turkey, being partly Jews, and partly Jesuits, who incited the
Turks to begin the War, and to push it on even to the Capital of the Empire; and did at the same time, by other Agents, both in Poland, and at Venice, all they could, that they might hinder those Countries to come into the Confederacy against them, as thinking themselves Cock-sure, that if Vienna had once been taken, the German Princes would have been in such a Con∣sternation, that as the only remedy, they would have called in the French Power to oppose against such a dreadful inun∣dation of Infidels as would thence have followed; and for which they could have done no less than to have declared the Dauphin King of the Romans, and have made the French King Guardian and Pro∣tector in the interim, of the Emperor and Empire, especially having the Ele∣ctors of Cologne, Mentz, and Triers, either inclined for, or over-awed by them, and it being easy in that juncture to have forced the rest: This, my Lord, is the substance of what I have found they have projected upon this Subject from time to time, as the circumstances of Affairs gave way and occasion and no∣thing more certain than that they have had it all along in their view, to advance the Dauphin to that Dignity, which they have hitherto failed in, and I hope ever shall. I did not think to have entred up∣on this subject, which is also somewhat re∣mote
from the Affairs of our own Coun∣try, but that the sight of the foremen∣tioned Author excited my curiosity, and the fondness of the discovery made me also fond to communicate the same to your Lordship, tho' perhaps no very grate∣ful part, which yet I trust your goodness will pardon, in him, who is, My Lord, Your very humble, and obedient Servant. Paris, Jan. 14. 1684. N. S.
LETTER XXXIX. Of Don John of Austria's being hindred to take upon him the Ad∣ministration of the Spanish Affairs in the year 1676. My Lord, IT's not long since I have given your Lordship an account of the advances made by this Court towards a Peace; but you know, since that, the War went on with various successes; and perhaps your Lordship has heard of the Business of Don John in Spain, How he was pre∣vented from having the Administration of the Affairs of that Country, by a Let∣ter under the King of Spain's Hand, when he was just going to embark for the relief of Messina; there was at that time an expectation in the Confederates of mighty things to be perform'd by him to their advantage, and the preventing him from a share in the Government, was esteemed generally to be a French Trick, and so it was; but I believe the Confederates were guilty of a grand mistake in their expectation of him; for the French Memoirs say, Don John was
perfectly their Creature, and that it was the violent hatred of the Queen Mother of Spain, as well as a jealousie to have her own Power invaded, that put him beside the Administration; That it was through his means the Matching of the King of Spain with the Emperor's Daugh∣ter was put by, and that with the Duke of Orleans's Daughter effected; and that he was going to act mighty things for the French Interest, for which he had large Promises made him of their power∣ful and effectual Assistance to obtain the Crown of Spain for himself, after the Decease of the present King, upon con∣dition he should quit the Spanish Domi∣nions in the Indies, Low-Countries, and Italy, to the Crown of France; for the performance of which, they had sufficient Assurances from him. I am further to observe to your Lord∣ship from the said Minutes, That they have attributed his Death to a Dose of Poison administred by the order and par∣ticular prescription of the Queen-Mother, and that out of a fear she had he would one day Poison the King her Son; and because he had against her Will, been the instrument to make the French Match. They further add, how true the one or the other, I will not take upon me to determine, That the Queen Mother's ha∣tred to Don John was inveterate; that she
had attempted once before to have Stab'd him, and at another time to Pistol him: As for the fore-mentioned Letter from the King of Spain, to stop the Don's passage for Messina, they say it was sent by the Instigation of the Duke de Medina Celi, then in the French Faction, with an intent to make him miss that stroke, and secure him in their Interests, by letting him know, that it was by their Intreague he was admitted to Court. I could further enlarge upon this subject, did I judge it pertinent or agreeable to your Lordship's humour, as I am affraid it is not; and therefore I remain, My Lord, Your Lordship's most humble! and devoted Servant. Paris, July 2, 1679. N. S.
LETTER XL. Of General Instructions given to the French Agents in England, to carry on the French Designs upon the Duke of York's Second Mar∣riage. My Lord, THo' the French Agents in England have had address enough to get the Match with the Duke effected according to their Desires; yet foreseeing that even this point could not elude the Peace be∣tween England and Holland, they endea∣voured to make the best advantage they could, by making a Counterpoise of it to the said Peace, and to a War we might afterward intend against them; as having thereby linked the Duke faster to them than ever, and laid a sure foundation for such Distractions, both in Church and State, as would give them large oppor∣tunity, if not to compass all the De∣signs they had upon us, yet at least to secure themselves from any great incon∣veniency from us; They were not igno∣rant
what good effects several previous Intreagues of theirs had to our dis∣advantage; they saw plainly the second Dutch War had much more impoverished us than the First; and the ill conduct of it much more sunk the King's Reputation, besides the Divisions in the Fleet, and the Jealousies and Factions in the Parliament, and among the People, about the Duke's Religion, produced him great disgusts e∣very day; That the shutting up of the Exchequer had ruined his Credit; and his Majesty in proclaiming Liberty of Con∣science by Virtue of his own Preroga∣tive, and his levity afterward in flinch∣ing from it so unexpectedly, had so dis∣obliged and wounded with Jealousie the Church of England, and all Patriots in Parliament tender of their Priviledges, who held the Peoples Purse-strings on the one side, and so incensed with a fresh Animosity the baffled Dissenters on the other; that being over-whelmed with Debts, opposed by dangerous and power∣ful Factions, and yet Bankrupt both of Money and Credit too; they fairly con∣cluded he could have no other recourse but to them; which odious remedy, they supposed, would but more and more heighten the mutual Jealousies, and widen the Breaches, till they grew large enough for them to enter by at long-run upon
some part of the English Monarchy, so famous hitherto for checking theirs above any other in Europe, since the Decadency of the Western Empire, from rising to the like exorbitant greatness: And now this more than Magical Dose, these Quacks in Po∣licy had given us, began to work every day more and more violently, and with Symptoms more visible, till almost mortal Convulsions followed; The ablest States∣man we had at the Helm, the Earl of Shaftsbury, was discarded for his vehe∣mency in opposing the said so pernicious Match, (of which I may give your Lord∣ship an account another time) and others of the same Sentiments discountenanced; which by the French Agency, begat the Prorogation of the Parliament, dangerous Factions and pernicious Fractions even among the most zealous Assertors of Mo∣narchy, and best affected Friends to the Royal Family; so that now imagining this Master-experiment of theirs had made way for them to execute what Projects they pleased on our Court and People for the future, to lose no advan∣tage for want of Managers, they began to put their Designs in form, which be∣fore lay somewhat perplext and out of order; to which end they sent over their Instructions to some Domestick A∣gents, whom they had chosen and placed
on purpose about the New Dutchess, and to their other assisting Ministers and E∣missaries, as they thought in that dis∣position of both Head  Body, of both Princes and People  could not but succeed, and produce in due time, the full effects by their Mischief-Brood∣ing, and Ambitious Consultations: And their Instructions in substance were as follows. They were now to make actual use of the several Parties they had, as I have hinted already, but as yet prepa∣red to make Tools of; and to this purpose they were to influence them part∣ly by French Jesuited Instruments, part∣ly by French Hugonot Agents, and of our own Nation, their Instruments were to be. I. Atheists and loose principled Men, who yet could act rarely well the Zea∣lots for that Religion or Cause which they were to Espouse. II. Such Persons as they found to be conceited of their Parts, and of Merce∣nary Spirits.
III. Hotspurs for Prerogative, and the Church of England. IV. The fiercest Spirits of the other Factions. V. Some Bigots of the Roman Com∣munion that were English, and particu∣larly those that had been bred up, or had travelled in their Dominions, and were well Jesuited. VI. The leading Irish Papists in parti∣cular. VII. Men, Ambitious of Greatness, or Idolizers of Money, and that chiefly in Scotland. VIII. Men disgustful or disabliged. IX. Men of desperate Fortunes and lost Reputations. Of all these they were with great confidence to imploy and highly to ob∣lige and flatter some, while they were for their turn, and disoblige others, and then when they had done with them, vice versa, to disoblige and cast off those whom they had obliged and seemed to
have trusted; and court, oblige, and re∣ceive others who were before disoblig'd, knowing how to work their Ends by those they disobliged as well as by those obliged; But yet none of these, except some of the first sort, were to know the whole of their Designs, nor be infor∣med of any thing that looked black or villanous, or seemed too directly to aim at the detriment or destruction of their Country or Religion, till such time as they had a long trial of their Tem∣pers, and found them fit for such At∣tempts, or that they had got them first into such a Correspondence, which, tho' in the ultimate intention was not mali∣cious, but only an effect of zeal to their several Parties, yet would, if discovered, be construed reasonable, and so keep them under an hank to them; and then they were to put them on such Barba∣rities and Villanies as they thought ne∣cessary for their purpose; which if they then refused, their Business was to aban∣don them, and to imploy such Instru∣ments as were as Bankrupt of Religion and Conscience as of Fortune, and would be desperately determined to venture at any thing for Money; and by these they were to be pretended to be detected as Traytors, and prosecuted as guilty of the Designs which they have been only
tempted to, and so were to serve all People whom they once got within their Toil, as occasions and their Interests did require. But I see I have already past over the just bounds of a Letter, and shall therefore only subscribe my self, My Lord, Your Lordship's most devoted Servant Paris, May 5. 1681. N. S.
LETTER XLI. Containing the Practices of the French Agents, for the amusement of Foreign Catholicks, while they carry'd on their Designs against England. My Lord, IT would be very strange to think, that the Ministers of this Court, who have had a hand almost in every thing relating to our Nation, should not be concerned in the affair of the Popish Plot; but it is so far otherwise, that they have been the chief managers and starters of many things which have since come to light; Nay, I am bold to say, That the very actions and in∣tentions of almost all the Instruments of the English Nation, and even of some of the French themselves, were very wide, tho' villanous enough, from those of the Machiavillian Off-spring which set them on work. My Lord, you have heard of Father St. Germain, and perhaps of Father Columbiere too, who succeeded him in En∣gland; these were the Persons, who toge∣ther with their other assisting Emissaries, disposed of Things and Parties in our Na∣tion to favour their Designs in reference
to the said Conspiracy, and whose Instru∣ctions from Father La Chaise, were to take upon them to inform and press upon the Creatures of the Pope, and Ministers and Creatures of other Princes of the Roman Communion, but of a different Interest from their Master's the French King; That for their parts, they were only actuated by a Zeal for the propagation of the Catholick Religion, and the re-union in time of so famous a Monarchy to the Church by gentle and peaceable ways and means, and chiefly for the Conversion of our two Princes so nearly Related to their King in Blood, and for whom he had so much Esteem and Affection; and that their Ma∣ster being their nearest Neighbour, and seated most conveniently to assist them on occasion, would with his Purse promote all he could the quiet Conversion of all sorts of People, that could be drawn in by the Godly Eloquence of their Missionaries, or by the more powerful language of Pensions with some, and was heartily willing to supply our Princes with what was needful, or might be so, to maintain themselves a∣gainst any Attempts that might be made against them, upon the jealousie or discove∣ry of any such design, and succour them by a sufficient Military Force too, in case they were likely to be reduced to Extremi∣ty by an open Rebellion of their stubborn
and discontented Subjects on that account; without once pretending to so idle and im∣practicable a design, as some of them whom they spoke to were tutored to call it, as by that means to go about to make the Crown of England seudatory to that of France, or to strengthen himself with the additional power of England, with intent to encroach afterwards upon the Rites and Prerogatives of the Holy See, or give Umbrage to other Temporal Enemies of that Communion, or to draw any other advantage to the French from the Alliance of the English Princes, than to be able in the quality of Most Chri∣stian King, and first Son of the Church, to promote the growth of the Holy Catholick Religion in their Realms and Dominions, and make use of their Mediation and Friend∣ship, to ballance in some measure the pre∣sent force of so formidable a Confederacy, as was lately formed against him. That it was a thing ridiculous to think, or once as much as imagin, that whilst he was in actual War with so many considerable Pow∣ers at that time, he could be so simple as to attempt England by force; or if he were out of War with them, that he could as much as offer at so considerable an Enter∣prize upon any pretence whatsoever, with∣out allarming them, or expecting to be opposed Vigorously by them, as well as by the other Protestent Powers of Europe;
or that he could be thought to be so rash as to venture on such a difficult Expediti∣on, whilst he foresaw so powerful an Op∣position. But that indeed upon the happy conclu∣sion of a general and lasting Peace among the Catholick Princes, he would most wil∣lingly and readily join and concur in any holy League with them, and contribute his full proportion of Forces with theirs, to so glorious and laudable a Work, as would be the restoration of the Kings of England to their pristine Power and Majesty, and the Holy See to its former just Au∣thority and Jurisdiction in these famous Islands; which for so many former Ages had made so considerable and profitable a Province of the Roman Church; and therefore they were to desire and press them, not to let any particular In∣terests which they had against their Ma∣ster in worldly and secular Concerns, pre∣vail with them to go about to mis-inter∣pret or any ways obstruct their Conver∣sion of Souls, which could be of no man∣ner of prejudice to them in those other respects; but rather readily to concur with their Endeavours in so pious and charitable a Work, wherein they ought wholly to lay aside all distinction of Na∣tions or Interests, and Cooperate as Mem∣bers
of one Body, and Subjects of one universal Prince Christ Jesus, and his Vice-gerent-General the Pope. With which Arguments and sly Suggestions, they were to wheedle all Foreigners to at least a careless security and unconcernedness about the Affairs of England, whilst they play'd their pranks to destroy both our Religi∣on and Government, and make us an Ap∣pennage of the Gallican Church and Crown; which I pray God, I may never live to see, nor my Country feel; and shall ever do so whilst I am, as I am resolved always to be, My Lord, Your Lordship's Most Humble, and Most Devoted Servant. Paris Mar. 11. 1682.
LETTER XLII. The Arguments of the French Emi∣saries, for the Amusement of some of the Native Papists of England, &c. That their designs in regard to the Popish Plot, might not be pre∣vented. My Lord, HOw far the Subject-matter of my last to your Lordship hath relished your Palate, I am altogether ignorant, but adventuring for once to presume its ha∣ving proved grateful, I have in this, as it were, subjoyned those Instructions the French Agents have received for the a∣musement of the Native Papists of En∣gland, in order to the carrying on of their Designs under the covert of the Popish Plot, against our Native Country; To them therefore they were to use in substance the same pretences as to the o∣ther, but with some further additions, as, That the King and the Duke of York, were both certainly gained over to the Church of Rome; That the most Leading-Men of the Kingdom, and the Men of most Power and Interest both among the Clergy
and Gentry of the Church of England, were Popishly inclined, and would with∣out all doubt, come galloping over tan∣tivy to the Church of Rome, when it should be a proper time for the King to declare himself upon that Head; as being well convinced, that Monarchy and Prelacy had no other way to defend themselves against the restless and violent practices and ef∣forts of the Sectaries and Republicans, and others their Adherents in the King∣dom, but by seasonably re-uniting with the Roman Catholick Party, from their unju∣stifiable Separation and Schism, from whence innumerable, incurable and endless Divi∣sions, Distractions and Factions, had pro∣ceeded. That for their comfort and sup∣port, it was now much otherwise than in the late Civil Wars against King Charles I. That the present King of France being in a condition to give their now Sove∣reign King Charles the Second, a most powerful and numerons Assistance; and being a most Generous Prince, and with∣al most cordially and well-affected to their King as well as to their Cause; there was no manner of question to be made, but he would effectually do it, without any by-ends of his own, as soon as a general Peace should give leave, by which time things would be ripe in the King∣dom, to favour his good Intentions to
go on with the Conversion of our Na∣tions; yea, and would take care to pro∣vide a sufficient Body of Troops for the abetting of so hopeful a Work, in case there should be any such need of Force, but that it was reasonably to be supposed there would need none: For that by the help of safer Methods and of Mony, which that great and zealous Prince would not let them want for so good a Work, the number of the Roman Catholicks must needs be so mightily encreased in a few Years, that the King might ven∣ture to declare himself in their favour; and then by the voluntary return of the Church of England to Rome, their Mo∣ther Church, and by the very dread of the formidable Power of Lewis the Great, who was known to be a sure and fast Friend to our two Royal Brothers, the other dissenting Factions would be so over-powered with the number of their Opponents, and so terrified at their Strength, that if it had not the good effect to work them up into a comply∣ance, it would at least into such a tame∣ness, that they would neither be able to hinder, nor have the rashness to oppose what Changes and Innovations the King should afterwards have a mind to make in Church or State, and make them Triumphant in England. And thus they were to lead
them on till they had noosed them fast in a Correspondence with them; but not a word was to be told them (till they had first sounded them whether they were fit to hear it) of any design they had to subject England, or enslave the rest of Eu∣rope to French Tyranny, or of the Murder of King or Duke, or both, in case they found them not pliable enough to their Instigations, or that their abominable Ends could be compassed no other ways; to which, if they would not be compli∣ant, they were then by those Tools to have some of their Correspondence with them discovered, and have them accused as if they had been really guilty of what they were only tempted to: And so by this means all the considerable Men of them, besides some Rascals to make Tools of, were to be drawn into a close Correspondence with France, and beaten quite off from any application to Rome, or correspondence with the House of Austria; sliely insinuating, that France was the only Power in Christendom that could preserve or support them. But the full design they had upon the Nation (as before hinted) was a Se∣cret imparted but to a very few; nay, it was not as much as communicated to the Jesuits of the two British Nations, but kept almost to the last, as an Arcanum among such of them as were Native French, except only
two or three Irish Fathers, and some very few more of that same Nation, whom they thought averse enough to the English Name and Nation, to be heartily true and constant to any Foreign Interest and Pow∣er capable to support and effectually to back them in the bloodiest and blackest Contrivances against their detested Con∣querors: for rather than fail, to such hor∣rid Tragedies they were determined by some means or other to proceed, if they could no otherwise effect their wicked Pur∣poses, and could have found a way to fix the Crime, as they had projected, on some other Party and Nation. My Lord, I have been tedious, but could not avoid it; I design without a Countermand to trans∣mit to Your Lordship in my next the ap∣plications made to rhe Protestant Party up∣on the same Head; and in the mean time remain, My Lord, Your Humble Servant. Paris, Mar. 17. 1682. N. S.
LETTER XLIII. Of the French Artifices to amuse the Protestants of the Church of En∣gland, while they carried on their Designs. My Lord, PUrsuant to my Resolutions in the close of my last Letter, without I recei∣ved a Countermand from your Lordship, which I have not, I am to acquaint you, what this Court's Maxims were, and what Methods they went upon, either to make the Protestants of the Church of England, helpful to their Designs, or at least to do them no disservice, and be no obstruction to them therein. To the Clergy therefore and Gentry of the forementioned Church, whom they ima∣gined there was any likelyhood to per∣vert, they were to alledge most of the same things as before, as Arguments to perswade and induce them to return to the Bosom of their Church, and would argue much from the agreement in ma∣ny
things of both Religons; and were In∣structed, sometimes not only first to insinuate and then affirm the King was actually Per∣verted; but were moreover impudently to assert, That such and such Bishops, such and such Eminent Doctors, such and such Peers of the Realm, and such and such remarkable Gentlemen, for In∣terests, Estates, and exquisice Parts, &c. were to their knowledge, certainly and infal∣libly so too, tho' at present but covertly; and, That a greater part of their Church (whatever they might suggest with them∣selves to the contrary) than they were aware of, or was easily indeed to be imagined, were of the same Sentiments; but that they were under a restraint, and durst not declare themselves to be such, for fear of the Mobile, and of the Pres∣byterians, other Sectaries and Republican Parties, which like so many evil Spirits, presided over those Savage kind of Ani∣mals, and stirred them as they pleased themselves, against their Superiors. But to those, My Lord, whom they found to be of the more inflexible sort, they were instructed to make use of great Flatteries and Complements, and to ac∣quaint them, that they had a great deal of reason to love the Roman Catholicks, as the Roman Catholicks had to do so
by them; for that they had had for a long time the same Common Enemies; had suffered much with them conjointly for the same Royal Cause in the late Re∣bellions; that their Adversaries were nu∣merous enough to require their united Power and Strength against them; and that their subtilty was no less to be dreaded by them, whose effects could not be warded off without such a double Force; that there was much more dan∣ger to the Church and State of England, and to the Monarchical Government, now from the Sectaries, than from their Church; for it was plain to any one that was but willing to see, That it was now no more the Roman Catholicks Interest, since they were out of all hopes of being the pre∣dominant Religion in the Kingdom, to act against the Church or State of En∣gland, under whom they had such mild Treatment, but much rather to join and fall in with them against the Sectaries and Common-wealth's-men, under whom they could never expect any thing but utmost Rigour and Cruelty; That it be∣ing impossible for them alone to support and maintain themselves in England against so great a number of Sectaries, as were with the greatest inveteracy imaginable animated against them, without the Pro∣tection of the Church of England, and
the Monarchy, tho' but by way of Con∣nivence; It was therefore so much their Concern and real Interest, to Pray for and endeavour after the Prosperity of both Parties, tho' different in Perswasion, that they had no reason to fear any thing from them, nor be alarm'd at the Con∣versions they had happened to make, which were so few and inconsiderable, as never to be able to do them hurt, had it been so designed, as it was not; That there was no danger neither from the French King's Friendship or close Al∣liance with their King, it being the only Foreign Security, as matters then stood, that he could have against the intriegues and power of the United Provinces; who not only ruined their Commerce by Sea, but were the only People that buoyed up and supported the Sectaries and Repub∣lican Party, and harboured and abetted all Designs both against the Church and State of England under the then Monar∣chy; it being their inseparable Interest in all things to thwart the English, al∣most in every particular they valued themselves upon in the present Establish∣ment; Whereas, there was no exception to be made, but that it was his Most Christian Majesty's undoubted Advantage and fix∣ed Interest to cultivate by all good Offi∣ces the said Friendship and Alliance, and
to avoid by all manner of means any Rupture or Mis-intelligence with England, and to oppose above all things, the change of our Monarchy into a Repu∣blick. In the last place, continued they, Whereas, there had been for some time Reports spread not only of the Duke's, but the King himself's being of their Perswasion, they were to give out to this sort of Men, that that was only a suspicion, and, as they really believed, ill-grounded enough; for tho' they had reason to wish them, and all Mankind else, of their Opinion in that case; yet they had no such reason to think them so; but that the King's having shewed some fa∣vour to them upon the score of their Sufferings for, and Fidelity to his Father and himself, and out of respect to the Most Christian King with whom he was so closely Alli'd, for his better support and establishment against the enemies of Monarchical Government, was the only grounds People had had for such Ru∣mours, which were industriously foment∣ed only by the Authors of the former Fears and Jealousies against his Father, in order to get an opportunity thereby once more to destroy the Regal Govern∣ment: And, that they made this noise
indeed against Popery, but levelled it only at Episcopal and Kingly Government, not at such contemptible Adversaries as the Roman Catholicks were at that time of day. Then as for the Duke, they were to affirm, They thought and had reason to believe, he was no more a Catholick than the King; but that being a Prince of an high and inflex∣ible Spirit, and Heir presumptive to the Royal Diadem, disdained to be compel∣led by any Subjects, either to take an Oath, or give any account of his Religion, on∣ly to gratifie their Humours and Fancies; and chose rather to forbear acting in any publick Employment: But, that for their part, as he had not yet declared against the Church of England, so he had as yet made no profession of the Roman Catholick Religion as they knew of, but took care to keep himself as much reserved towards them, as towards those of the Protestant Perswasion. By such sort of Sophisiry and cunning Artifices, thrse French Incendiaries were in∣strumental to endeavour to Keep up the Stiff Church Party in a perpetual Animosity against the Protestant Dissnters and Dutch Party, as both of a Party; and to stir up the Government to side still with the French Interest against the power
and growth of the one, and provide with severity against the Practices of the other, in order to exasperate as much as possibly they could, the Spirits of both Parties against the other, and widen the Breaches beyond all possibility of resto∣ring them again. Which how well they have already effected, is but too well known, and no less sorely felt in the Bowels of the Kingdom for me to take upon me to Descant upon; and therefore I shall forbear, and only subscribe my self, My Lord, Your Lordship's Most humble Servant to Command. Paris, Mar. 28. 1682.
LETTER XLIV. Of the French Intrigues to raise a good Opinion in the Protestant Dissenters of England, of the French King's Proceedings, and to Calumniate their own King. My Lord, I Am come to the last Body of Men within the Kingdom, whom this Court, by such like Engines as I for∣merly mentioned, has endeavoured to manage for to serve their own turn, to the Kingdom's disadvantage, and they are the Protestant Dissenters; but they were necessitated, to give the less um∣brage, to change their shapes and form of expression to those of that Party whom they had the design upon, and to whom they closely and warmly re∣monstrated; That they had no occasion to be jealous of the Proceedings of France, and be animated so fiercely against King Lewis, if they would but once consider,
the great Liberty and Priviledges which their Protestant Brethren enjoy'd in the French Dominions; their former assisting the oppressed Protestant Dutch, and other Protestant States, against the Bloody In∣quisitors, and Unchristian Inquisition; the severe Persecutions of the House of Au∣stria, the frequent differences of France with the Court of Rome, and the lit∣tle power the Pope was allowed in the Gallican Church, no more than what was Titular; and that if these things were but duly weighed, it might be more than presumed, the present French King would little concern himself, or any way in∣termeddle with Religious Contests in England: But that whatever opinion they might have of that Neighbouring King to his disadvantage, which yet did but little affect or concern him, they had on the contrary much occasion to look a∣bout them at home; and to that end, these Emissaries were to promote, tooth and nail, the belief of the King and Duke's being both Papists; but parti∣cularly to affirm, that the Duke was most certainly of that Religion, and at the same time to discover assured Evi∣dences of it; as also of the Mea∣sures concerted to bring in both Popery and Arbitrary Power, and really to detect some Measures, which them∣selves
had as yet but only projected, or at least but proposed, and that too but to the Duke only, as if they had been fully consented to, and begun underhand to be put in practice; And having once well imprest this, they were to exaggerate the greatness and eminen∣cy of the danger, the more to alarm them; and slily to insinuate, that an Accommodation was Transacting be∣tween the two Churches of Rome and England; and a thousand other Artifi∣ces they us'd besides, to animate each Party against the other, too tedious for your Lordship to read, or me to re∣late; neither need I tell you how they tra∣versed one another's designs, only I must Note, Sir Roger L'Estrange, and almost all the Writers for that side, under a pretence of serving the Church of Eng∣land, and the Monarchy, and some al∣so of the other Party, though unknown to themselves, were and are still but the unhap∣py Tools and Instruments of French Jesuits and Machiavillian Emissaries; who were the main Conjurers, that by undisco∣vered Spells have raised up those Devils of Discord, that under the Names of Whigs, Tories, and Trimmers, have so much disturbed our Native Country, and the LORD knoweth where it will terminate. I am glad to hear your
Lordship hath so well exerted the Cau∣tion and Prudence inherent in your Fa∣mily in these times of difficulty, and may it be so still, which is the hearty desire of, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble and most Obedient Servant. Paris, April 8. 1682. N. S.
LETTER XLV. Of the Duke of York's being drawn into a close Correspondence with the French Court, with an Account of his Pension from thence. My Lord, I Cannot think your Lordship will so much admire, that the Duke should suffer himself to engage into a close Cor∣respondence with the French Court, yea, and to enter into a separate Treaty with them, when other things more un∣likely, have been made evident enough so as not to be contradicted: I cannot tell at present whether there be any other par∣ticulars of this same Treaty, than what has come within my Cognizance; but so much as has, as I hope it will be acceptable, I as freely communicate, and was in substance as followeth.
First, The Duke was engaged to stick close to his Alliance with France, decli∣ning all Treaties with those of the House of Austria, and even with the Pope him∣self, without the French King's Privity and Approbation. Secondly, To oppose to the utmost of his Power, the King his Brother, from engaging in any War for the Confede∣rates. Thirdly, To joyn with him, the French King, in making a strong Effort to draw in, if possible, the Prince of Orange to embrace a separate Interest from that of the States of Holland; and if not, to come over to the Roman Religion, at least to enter into a separate Treaty with the Kingdoms of France and Eng∣land, under a pretence of laying a sure foundation for his own future Great∣ness, and establish it on both sides the Sea by the suppression of all Factions which now disturbed his Uncle, and might afterward disturb him; and in case he proved still obstinate, to second him in all Methods that might be used to hinder his Succession to the Crown of England, by hindring any Match that might be proposed between the Prince
and the Princess Mary; and that he should for that purpose keep off Matching either of his Two Daughters upon seve∣ral pretences to gain time till a fit juncture might come, when Matches might be accomplished for them both, with French Princes, or some other Princes in that Interest, viz. the eldest to the Dauphin, and the younger to the Duke of Savoy, or a Prince of the Houses of Conde or Conti, or to the Duke of Modena. Fourthly, That the Duke should do his utmost to have the Government of his Children himself, and to have them Tu∣ored, if possible, in his own Religion; and if they were obstinate, in case he should sail of other Issue, then they would have had him to exclude them, and Adopt the Duke of Chartres for his Heir, (but this was only proposed) and Intail the Crown thence forward to Heirs Male only, and to have the Sa∣lique Law Established in England, as well as in France; but and if he should not be powerful enough to hinder a Match with the Prince of Orange, or some other Protestant Prince, (but of the former they were most jealous,) then to concur with them to cut him off; but this point would not be formally assented to neither.
But all Points proposed were on his part easily assented to; As doing his utmost for the propagation of the Ca∣tholick Religion, pursuing Measures con∣certed for dividing of Protestants, un∣dermining of Parliaments, and putting forward Arbitrary Counsels without re∣serve, and particularly to raise Arms in Scotland and Ireland, and call in French Forces, in case the King should at any time, by any Motives whatsoever, be influenced to act to the French King's prejudice. Lastly, The Duke was to take care, That no Popish Clergy or Layety should be imploy'd by him, but such as were in the French Interests, and trust his main Secrets with none but such as were French-born Jesuits; on which Conditions he was to have a conside∣rable Annuity of Six hundred thousand Crowns, and extraordinary Sums when necessary, and the circumstances of things did require to carry on any of the fore∣mentioned Points, even to what he pleased himself to demand. So all things being thus concluded, he received in hand, Three hundred thou∣sand Crowns of his Annuity, and Six
hundred thousand Crowns extraordinary; and Jewish Bankers were accordingly imployed to transmit the Money to him from time to time; Besides all which, the French King's Confessor promised him a private Contribution from the Clergy, and others under his influence, of six hundred thousand Crowns more. But notwithstanding all these mighty pro∣mises, and other more magnificent ones, That he should not want five or six Millions of Livres at any time, to bring a design to perfection when once he had made a progress; their Notes say, That private directions were given to feed him only with such mean pittances as would but just enable him to keep himself up, and persuade him still to go on, to per∣plex matters, or Broviller les Cartes as they term it, raise and exasperate Factions and Parties; but never to proceed so far as totally to suppress any, lest he should make himself too much Master, and by that means be able to set up for him∣self, without their further Aid and Con∣currence, or have any Money to spare and lay up for his own use, or to im∣ploy in private Cabals against them. The same Method they used. My Lord, with most of their other Pensioners a∣mong the English Popish Party; but to
all their other Instruments, they were most liberal and punctual, till such time as they had no further use of them, and had a mind to turn them off, and pro∣voke them, as we have said, to use their Talents on a contrary side. Pardon, I beseech, your Lordship, my prolixity, and interpret it for a willingness to serve you, as it really is, in him, who is, My Lord, Your most humble and most devoted Servant. Paris, Jan. 28. 1680. N. S.
LETTER XLVI. Of the Dutchess of York's being gain∣ed entirely to the French Interests: With an Account of the Proposals she assented to. My Lord. HAving gained the Duke over into their Interests, so far as to assent to the performance almost of every Proposal to him on their part, as I have in my last set forth at large to your Lordship; The next step was to bring in the Dutchess, his Consort, now into the same or worse Noose, who being an adopted Daughter of France, and of the Feminine Gender, they found no hard Task to effect; and after some Tampering, they at last pre∣vailed so far as to persuade her to dis∣cover to them from time to time, her Husband's greatest Secrets, and would never let him rest, but be incessantly teazing him till she had extorted all that was worth knowing or communication from him; not to fail to transmit unto them an account from time to time of the Money the Duke received from them,
how he spent it; to use all the influ∣ence she had over him, to perform with utmost exactness all the points of his Agreement with them; but more parti∣cularly that part which related to the Duke's Daughters; and finally, to second effectually the means which they should prescribe her at any time about giving an Italian Fig to the King, either of the two Princesses, or all of them, if it were though requisite, as the cause of Religi∣on, her own main Interest of securing the English Throne in the Succession of it to her Husband and her own Issue, should necessari∣ly require, without concerning the Duke her Husband at all in the said Intrigue; In con∣sideration of her compliance wherein, she was likewise to have an Annuity assign∣ed her, but the definite Sum is not men∣tioned; and whether she had Sons or Daughters to live, she, as far as lay in her power to promote it, was to assent to have them Match'd to the most ap∣parent of the Royal Family of France, if there were any such for them; or into such other Princely Families as were most suitable for them in the Judg∣ment of his Most Christian Majesty; who did oblige himself to take a Paternal care of them, and would ever keep his Royal Word by the exactest Perfor∣mance. I do not question but these things
are a Trouble to your Lordship; tho' I am apt to persuade my self, you would not willingly be without the perfectest Intelligence of them that you can get, wherein I have had the Honour, and shall always think my self happy to serve you in any the least degree, and am proud of the opportunity to subscribe my self once more My Lord, Your Lordship's Most Humble and Most Obedient Servant. Paris, Jan. 12. 1680.
LETTER XLVII. Containing a general Account of Par∣ties engaged in French Interests, and of their Designs; but more parti∣cularly of one Kelly a Priest, &c. My Lord, YOur Lordship will not now wonder, when such as I have mentioned in some of my late Letters, have plung'd themselves so deeply in French Sudds, that others should be so easily drawn into their Interests; I am to acquaint you therefore, That this Court had, accor∣ding to their Projection, gain'd the most considerable Roman Catholicks in the Three Kingdoms, by fair and specious Pretences, to comply even to every thing they desired of them; as thinking King Lewis to be a most Generous Prince, that had no By-ends in it, but as he was most able, was most willing to promote the propagation of that Religion, and the re∣instating their King in a condition to Protect them, out of a pure piece of Ho∣nour and Zeal for the Catholick Faith,
as they were wont to Word it; who therefore most willingly entred into a Correspondence with his Agents and E∣missaries; and some of them took Pen∣sions, but I cannot give your Lordship a List of their Names at this juncture; but most of that Kidney acted freely, in using all the endeavours they possibly could, to induce both King, Duke, &c. to a compliance with them in all things they had instructions to move to them and sollicit for; as they had long done themselves in the points I have already mentioned to your Lordship, and which I need not repeat: But tho' they de∣signed, if either one or both of the Roy∣al Brothers should disoblige them too much, especially the King, or that any juncture of things, or grand conveniency of theirs, should persuade, to proceed to some barbarous Extremity against the Persons of one or both of them; yet they thought not good to trust any British Papists with any thing so black, no not so much as their Jesuits, but took par∣ticular heed to reserve thse Mysteries to another Cabal, having provided for that a Juncto of Foreigners and Irish for the taking off the King, if things came to that extremity: And as for the Duke, they seemed not much afraid of him, and therefore made no such exact provision,
but they knew of some two or three desperate Fanaticks, whom they had in reserve for that purpose, and they were of the Scotch Nation; but if the King alone was to be taken off, then the Dutchess's Cabal in conjunction with that of Portsmouth, were to engage in it; but if things came to that extremity, as that both Brothers were to be removed, then Portsmouth's Gang was only to be im∣ployed, without the concern or privity of the other. And this last Cabal of Portsmouth's was composed of French and Irish Jesuits, and Jesuited Popish Bi∣gots. But among them there was a certain Priest named Kelly, who was a long time Ban∣ker to the Cabal, and is still I believe, on this side the Water, and coming to hear by the Correspondence he held with his Complotters in England, there were some who scrupled such Undertakings; he went Over, saying, He would procure enough to do either of the Works if occasion were. I had once a Bill upon him for a Friend of mine, and then I remember he railed mightily against both King and Duke, and said they were both Knaves, Fools and Cowards, for that having for∣saken the French Interest, they would be Ruined, and see all their Kingdoms quickly
in Flames; That it was an easie matter for the King of France to do it; That it would very quickly be effected, and be a most laudable Action; and would, he hoped, end in the total subjection of the Three Kingdoms to the French King's Power, which he heartily wished for his poor Country's sake, so tyrannized over by Hereticks; with abundance more of such Stuff; but I knew not then he was so deeply concerned as afterward, when I found his name for an Undertaker in Portsmouth's Cabal; one Father Patrick also who used often to go and come, and was wont to conceal his Intriguing under a pe∣culiar appearance, was another of the same Cabal, with two or three French Men, whose Names I have not at present. Your Lordship will pardon this imperfect Ac∣count, and judge favourably of his Endea∣vours, who desires nothing more than to gratifie your Expectation, who am, My Lord, Your Honour's most Humble and Devoted Servant. Paris, Jan. 19. 1680, N. S.
LETTER XLVIII. Of the Private Treaty between King Charles the Second, and the French King. Anno 1576 My Lord, I Have already upon two several occa∣sions observed to Your Lordship, how the Duke and Dutchess were drawn into private Correspondences with the French Court, which when they had once happily effected, and by them and some others, already in their Interests, (whereof I have mentioned soome) drawn in, many more both Courtiers and o∣thers; they proceeded, being thus so con∣siderably re-inforced, to hedge in the King himself; and it was high time, for they had now a greater Jealousie than ever, of the Match with the Prince of Orange, tho' he were not yet come over into England to that purpose; and so far they did prevail, that he did ob∣lige himself to do all he could to ob∣serve still a partial Neutrality with them:
Then they proposed his hindring the Match with the Prince of Orange, unless he could be drawn into a separate Trea∣ty with the two Kings, and delay at all Matching of the Princesses till a general Peace, and to reserve the Eldest for the Dauphin; tho' in the mean while they pro∣mised the Duke of Bavaria the same ad∣vantage for his Daughter, the better to keep him in a Neutrality with them during the then War with the Confede∣rates, but never intended it with the latter, if they could have effected it with our Princess; But in that, the King told them, There might be difficulties insuperable, and so could promise them nothing but his Endeavours, which by reason the Parliament and People were much out of Humour, upon the Duke's late Match would require much Money; be∣cause now for him to go about to cross them afresh, in obstructing, or so much as delaying such a Match, the pro∣posal whereof was already so much known to his People, and found to be so much desired by them, as the only remedy they imagined they had left them against the feared mischief of the other, would hinder them perhaps from grant∣ing him such Supplies as he might o∣therwise expect of them: unless his Most Christian Majesty obliged himself to
supply him with Money enough to need them not, or at least to buy Votes, and to stop clamorous Mouths; but as for that Motion of theirs about committing the Children to the Duke's Care and Tu∣orage, tho' they were seconded in it by the Duke himself with all the im∣portunity imaginable, yet he absolutely denied them; saying, They were his Children, or rather the Nation's, and not the Duke's, especially now he had Matched so much against the Nation's liking; and that could he have be∣lieved the People of England would have taken so much Allarm at that Marriage, he should have taken care to have stopped it in time; But that ha∣ving let one Fault pass, to admit another much worse, was a thing he doubted not but would cause such Earthquakes as he was resolved not to run the risque of, therefore should not do it; so that Article was wholly laid aside, and the Treaty concluded without, by which the French King was to pay ours an Annuity of Twelve hundred thousand Crowns, whereof Six hundred thousand in hand, besides a Donative of a like Sum at the same time for Extraordi∣naries, and if any occasion should hap∣pen by crosness of Parliaments, Rebel∣lion, or otherwise, that should reaso∣nably
require so much, then he was promised to have it augmented to twelve Millions of Livres whilst such Troubles should last, tho' this latter part they never intended, but gave or∣ders he should be treated only with a Bit now and then, as was the Duke his Brother; only if a Civil War should happen, they were to feed it on both sides, till it were fit to pour in French Forces among them, &c. Yet I have observed, during my abode in this Station, that there was a Fund of Twen∣ty Millions of Livres designed for our three Kingdoms, whereof sometimes they gave largely to the King and Duke his Brother, and slenderly to the se∣veral Factions, only to keep them in heart; and sometimes again largely to them, and little or none to the King and Duke, to make the former Lusty, and Mettlesome to kick and keep the others Low, that being in a crowing condition, they might comply with them. Of those Sums, there has gone some years Four, sometimes Six, and sometimes Eight Millions to Scotland and Ireland; but to the King and Duke, there never went more than than I have mentioned, and that but the first Year neither; all the rest went to the
other Courtiers, and to the several Factions, who of late have had most of it. In this Treaty, which was concluded by a private Agent, as were the others, there was a Clause incerted, which gave the King leave, if too much press'd up∣on, to pretend as if he would side with the Confederates against France, and to get Money of them, as also of his Parliament on that account; but yet he was by no means to Declare, but to get an Army and Revenue settled for some time, such as was supposed to be the duration of the War, and then to use both the one and the o∣ther to settle his Prerogative-Royal, and make himself Absolute, &c. I can∣not, My Lord, without some Reluctancy, think of several Passages in this Epi∣stle, and particularly, that a King who above Twenty Years had had the greatest opportunity of any of his Pre∣decessors to make himself great both at Home and abroad, should fall to so abject a State, as to become a French Pensioner, which without the ad∣dition of any other Crime, is more than enough eternally to blast the Me∣mory of an English Monarch; but I know
this Subject can be ungrateful to no one alive more than to your Lordship; and therefore I shall forbear further insisting upon it, and remain, My Lord, Your Honour's to Serve and Obey. Paris, Jan. 27. 1680. N. S.
LETTER XLIX. Of King Charles II's Politick's upon his Entring into the fore-mentioned pri∣vate League with France, as repre∣sented by the French Court. My LORD, IN my last, your Lordship had the sub∣stance of the Private League entred into by our King, and this Court, it may not be now unworthy your curiosity to know the Censure they have past upon him in rela∣tion to that head; they have said, they un∣derstood well enough that what ever their Design might be in obtaining such a point, that the King, and his Brother's too up∣on them, was to draw as much Money out of them as they possibly could thereby, and yet not to venture too far on any of those important and ticklish Points propo∣sed, without very large Summs, to secure every Step made forward, and that by ad∣vance too; for that they both concluded that the best and only way to make the French stick close to them was, to be al∣ways considerably before-hand with them, not without reason, as they imagined, fea∣ring, that if they were not still before∣hand, when they had engaged them in Difficulties, and saw them fast, they would
leave them in the lurch: As for the King, tho' they knew him to be no more a Papist than he was a Politician, yet he was of the Opinion, if the Popish Religion could be handsomly made predominant, it might suit better with the Monarchy; yet having no Children to succeed him, that he was but careless in that point, and his Brother only being concerned in that matter, he moved only as he was spurred on by his importunity, the Temptation of Money, the Diffidence he had of his People, and among others, the Fears he had either of having his days shortned, or his Crown very much endangered by the Intrigues of his Brother, or the French King; should he not keep fair and humour them both in some tollerable measure, since he found himself so far intangled in their snares: For as for his Nephew the Prince of Orange, that he had no aversion for him, but rather an in∣clination through Nature and Policy, and therefore was of himself willing enough the Match should go on; yet that he would have been glad, if the Prince could have been drawn over to the French Inte∣rest, for that then he thought he would have compassed many desirable Ends in one business, and made a very great ad∣vance to have satisfied all parties in the greatest part of their several Pretensions; because that then he supposed he could have satisfied the French King, in bringing
over a Prince to his Interest so very capa∣ble to serve him in that juncture of time; that he would have satisfied also those of his own Subjects, who were well affected to the English Monarchy, as he would have likewise our Trading Companies, by mar∣rying our Princess to a Prince of the Pro∣testant Religion, whom he by separating from the Interests of the States of Holland, and drawing into a League with two great Kings, should have put into a condition to depress that Republick, which was so ill a Neighbour to the Monarchy, so much our rival in Trade, and so great a fomen∣ter of the Schisms and Factions in England; that thereby he should have laid grounds to hope, that if ever he succeeded to those Crowns, he might be able to subject the Belgick to the British Lions, and transfer the magazine of the Riches of the World from the Netherlands into England; and that fie thought to have satisfied the Duke, his Bro∣ther, in a great measure, by so satisfying his friend the French King, and likewise by de∣pressing a Republick so well scituated and in∣clined to abet his deadly Enemies, that in all appearance would way-lay his Succession to the Throne, and thereby cutting off all occasion from that Male-content party, that continually sought occasion to stir up against him the old Devils of Fears and Jealousies of Popery and Arbitrary Power. And that he thought to oblige the Prince
too, by putting him into a method to be∣come a Sovereign in time. And lastly, that he was perswaded, if the Prince com∣plied with those Methods, the Match could disoblige no body, but the States of Hol∣land, and the sympathizing Factions of the Sectaries in England, and the Republicans, whom he thought inconsiderable; but that how desirous soever he was of such a Com∣pliance with France, as they desired, yet it was not in his inclination to break the Match, for that he having in reality a much grea∣ter mind to the Alliance with the Prince of Orange, than to that with the Dauphine, in which he did imagine he foresaw un∣furmountable Difficulties, and such as might endanger, if not over-turn, his Throne, ruine his Brother, and the whole Royal Family, and at last make Great Britain but a French Province; however that know∣ing the Temper of the Duke, his Brother, and the vindicative humour of the French King, he was willing to seem almost all com∣plaisant, and temporize for a while, where∣by he might appease them, and at the same time get what Money could be drawn from France, both for his own security and pleasure; and when he had done that, that he knew wheeling about and con∣cluding the Match, when they least thought of it, or expected it would please his peo∣ple again, tho' never so unsatisfied by the delay. These, my Lord, are the Sentiments
of this Court, concerning him; which, if true, in all points, I conceive they are more beholding to him, than many persons in England are willing to believe of him; but I shall leave it to your Lordships profound Judgment, to revolve upon the particu∣lars, and remain, My LORD, Your Lordship's Most Humble and Devoted Servant Paris, Feb. 1. 1680. N. S. LETTER L. Of the Duke of York's Politicks upon his entring into a close Correspondence with France, as the French Politicians represent them. My LORD, AS I have transmitted to your Lordship the exactest Particulars I could learn concerning the King's entring into a pri∣vate Treaty with France, and in my last the Censure of this Court thereupon; I have also to the best of my remembrance given you likewise an Account of the Duke's being drawn into a close Corre∣spondence
with them some time before; but whether it were that the Ministers on this side conceived such a Judgment of the King, as I have already related, and such of the Duke, which I am just about to relate, I cannot possitively determine; but thus it is they censure him, saying, That though he was so much a Bigot in Religion that he was totally averse to the Aurangian Alliance, unless it could be reconciled to those ends which he proposed to himself thereby, and especially about Replanting both the Popish Religion and Absolute Power in the three Kingdoms, and incline rather to the Match suggested with the Dauphine, with an in∣tent the more friendly to oblige his Most Christian Majesty to assist him through all the difficulties he fore-saw he had to pass; yet he was not a little affraid, of the great Resistance he knew would necessarily be made against such an Alliance, which many in England looked upon as the most per∣nicious that ever could befall their Nati∣on; being also of himself not a little jea∣lous, that if once such a Match between his Eldest Daughter and the Dauphine were concluded, some sly practises might be carried on by the French Court, against the Issue he should have by his now Dutch∣ess, in favour of that his Daughter might probably have by the Dauphine; and there∣fore that he was much more willing and desirous, if it might be compassed, that a
Match might in time convenient be con∣cluded between his said Daughter rather and his Dutchesses Brother, the Duke of Modena, or some Italian Prince, of no power enough to be apprehended to enter∣tain any such Designs; and that as much French as she was before, his Dutchess was now of the same Sentiments too, being married, and in hopes of a numerous Is∣sue by the Duke. These are all the Par∣ticulars I have hitherto met with, in rela∣tion to the Duke and his Dutchess's Senti∣ments, and with which I conclude, who am, My LORD, Your Lordship's Most Humble and Devoted Servant. Paris, Feb. 14. 1680. N. S. LETTER LI. Of Coleman's Intelligence, and private Correspondence with France, to the King and Duke's Disadvantage; and his Motions and Pretences for Money. My LORD, WHen I acquainted your Lordship with the Censure past by this Court up∣on the King and Duke's Sentiments, in
reference to their League and Correspon∣dencies with them, and especially the bu∣siness of the Match, I could neither deter∣mine whether it were purely their own Suggestions, collected from the Circum∣stances and natural Positions of things as they then stood, which I was inclined to, or to some secret Information from ano∣ther hand, but now I find the latter to be true; for whatever the King, Duke and Dutchesse's true Sentiments were, so they were represented under-hand by Coleman to the Juncto here, and by some other self∣ended Confidents of theirs, of whom but more particularly of Mr. Coleman I find it thus inserted in our Minutes: That being entered into a close and separate Corre∣spondence of his own with this Court, be∣sides that known to their Highnesses, whose Agent he was, he was therein to give them intelligence of all that was transact∣ed at White-hall, and St. James's, that pos∣sibly he could, but more especially of the Comportment of the King and the Duke, as to the Points agreed on between France and them; as also of the Disposition of all the Factions in England, and of the foreign Ministers, &c. to obliege himself to make Parties to cross his Master, the Duke, or the King, or both; in case either, or both of them, should go about to deviate from the Measures prescribed them by the French Court.
I find, my Lord, he was besides this a great Undertaker for Conversions, and Proselyting Men to Rome, or rather France; and his Agreement with them was to have allowed him as an Annuity the Summe of Twenty Thousand Crowns pun∣ctually to be paid, and for Extraordinaries, as should be calculated, according to the emergency of the Occasions: His Preten∣ses for Conversions were manifold, and ex∣travagant enough in the relation of them; and did slily at first insinuate, and when he had once broken the Ice, warmly ur∣ged, that whereas the Duke had very large Remittances made him upon the ac∣count of Conversions, wherein he was an Undertaker; that it were more advisable, for the future, to entrust him with a mo∣derate Summe for that purpose, and there∣by save themselves that deal which they must have sent to the Duke upon that Account, if they should send any; and so moved them, entirely to wave that point with him, for that he could do much more in that nature, than the Duke could ever pre∣tend to, because more imperceptibly. He promised them likewise for the gaining of Members of Parliament over to their Interest, great and mighty things, and then discreetly insinuated those things already spoken of, about the Designs of the King and Duke towards them, and thereupon advised them to transmit unto
them both only but moderate Summes, and let him have but moderate ones, ac∣cording to a private Man's fortune, and he would take effectual care both to ma∣nage them, and do their business in Eng∣land more to purpose, than they would do without him. He also added, That to give the King and Duke great Summes, would be no o∣ther than to enable them to buy the Par∣liament's Votes for themselves, and not for the Interest of France, and to get such store of Money of them, that they would afterward take such measures as they themselves pleased, without any regard to France, being sure to please the People at any time whenever they were minded to go contrary to them; and much mat∣ter to the same purpose, with which I shall no farther trouble your Lordship, but sub∣scribe my self, as I unfeignedly am, and ever shall be, My LORD, Your most Obedient and Most Humble Servant. Paris, Feb. 28. 1680. N. S.
LETTER LII. The Duke of York moves the French Court for Money, according to the pri∣vate Agreement. My LORD, YOu have heard what a Spoke Mr. Cole∣man was pleased to put in the King and even, the Duke, his dear Master's wheel, which they, poor Princes, know∣ing nothing of, moved hard for the Summes promised by France: the Duke as supposing his Credit the better, being the forwarder of the Two, and whose Pretences were, that he had been forced to lay out by advance, the greatest part of the Money already pay'd to make Creatures for their mutual Interest, and future advantage, all such Enterprizes being much more charg∣able to begin, then to carry on, and per∣fect; that when Correspondencies were begun they must be carried on, and that still by advance, if any thing of service were expected, or hoped for. That he had a most difficult and uneasy Task to deal with the King, his Brother's timerous and changeable Disposition, and was, and had been at a very great Ex∣pence to greaze Favourites of more Kinds then one, that might influence and per∣swade
him to, and hinder others that might disswade him from what they in France did expect from him, or urged him to; as also to appease and quell Ene∣mies on all sides, which his late Match with their adopted Daughter, and change in Religion had stirred up violently a∣gainst him; and that to keep the King, his Brother, steddy in a favourable Neutrali∣ty in regard to France, and yet at the same time either break off the Match quite with the Prince of Orange, defer it so long as they desired, or negotiate a private Treaty with that Prince in their favour, and to their advantage, with that power and good ef∣fect desirable, required, as they might well imagine, more than ordinary Summes of Money, and all ready, and in Specie too. But that if besides his ordinary Allow∣ance, according to the Agreement, which he expected should be punctually pay'd him every six months, he could but have a Summ of a Million of Crowns again seasonably advanced him for Extraordi∣naries, before the time of the next proro∣gation of the Parliament were expired; then he did believe he might bring mat∣ters so to bear, by such a Reinforcement, so as to be able to gain Votes enough even in the Parliament it self to carry it a∣gainst all others, both in respect to the Neu∣trality, and to the gaining their Consent for deferring any Foreign Allyance, by
way of Marriage of either of his Daugh∣ters, till a General Peace was concluded, and work very much with the Prince of Orange too to comply with their desires, when he should see the Parliament gave him no hopes otherwise of compassing his Aims; or if not, yet at least he should be able hereby to keep himself still strongest in the Privy Council, and in the Court, where nothing should be transacted to their disadvantage. That both his own Friends and theirs had been so very successful, and made such wonderful progresses in Conversions of all sorts and Ranks of People, as that of such and such Peers of the Realm (I will not say your Lordship was one named among the rest) such and such Courtiers, and Mem∣bers of Parliament, &c. that such and such Bishops, Eminent Doctors in Divinity, and other dignified Clergy, and such and such Gentlemen who were remarkable for In∣terest and Estates, or Eminent for exqui∣site Parts, though they have learnt here since there was nothing more false, were either already converted, and quite brought over, or extraordinarily well inclined; and that there was no doubt to be made of it, but by an augmentation of about four or five hundred thousand Crowns more for the Cause and Interest of Religion, they might be able so to dispose of the greater and more noted part of the Conforming
Church of England, which was the main of their Work, as to bring them over to their Religion; yea, and even to declare for it, publickly too, as soon as they should be freed from the Fears of the English Mo∣bile, and of the Fanatical Sectaries, and see a General Peace concluded, and the King himself declare for it, being back'd with so powerful a Prince as his Most Christian Majesty was; that however ma∣ny of them were already brought over to the French Interest against the Dutch, and many more might be so, if timely Libera∣lity were offered, with many other Alle∣gations, set off with Coleman's usual flou∣rishes on the behalf of his Master, though he had countermined all before, as I have already hinted: And lastly, that he had once more attacked the King, his Brother, as to Religion, and that with great hopes; and that if he could have but Money enough to carry on the Point with the Church of England, he questioned not, but by that time a General Peace were negotiated, his Majesty would be induced to declare too, when besides, his support abroad from the Most Christian King, he should see himself backt by almost all his Royalists, then numerous enough in the Nation, and so great, yea, more than a probability of an Accommodation between the two Chur∣ches of Rome and England, and his potent Brother of France then by the Peace at full
Liberty to lend him all needful Help. My Lord, you see here what little Sincerity there was in all their mutual Proceedings: May the Reward be suitable, is my un∣feigned Wish; as it has been already to some. But—I am, My LORD, Your Lordship's Most Humble and Devoted Servant. Paris, Mar. 9. 1680. N. S. LETTER LIII. Of King Charles II's urging the French Court for his Remittances, according to the private League between them. My LORD, YOU have heard what pressing Instan∣ces His Highness has made for his Remittances, according to Agreement; and what mighty Encouragements he has given this Court of gaining their Ends, both in Court and Parliament: And now 'tis fit the King should put in his Plea at last; which he did in this manner, as their Minutes represent it.
That for his part, he had advanced ra∣ther more than less Money than he had already received from them, for carrying on their Work; and that, not to enume∣rate many Particulars, he would observe to them, that when he saw there was no other Probability of obliging his dear Bro∣ther of France, in preserving the Neutra∣lity, so much desired by him, but by Pro∣roguing of his Parliament, which they knew well enough, was a tender Point: That yet not to be wanting to his Bro∣ther's Interests, and his own Engagements, he had adventured so far, as even twice to Prorogue them; and had withal ex∣pended most of his own Moneys, in en∣deavouring, if possible, against the next Meeting, or Session of Parliament, to make a Party, so as to be able, in a Par∣liamentary Way, to over-match his Ad∣versaries, and those of the Most Christian King, his Brother; and not only that, but to be in a Condition to support himself, during their Recess, in the Figure he ought, as King of England, to make, both at home, and abroad, for his own Advan∣tage, as well as that of the Most Chri∣stian King's; and so carry on the Work of Mediation between him and the Con∣federates, as his Brother of France would have; as likewise the desired Negotia∣tions in Holland, to induce the Prince of Orange, to a Compliance, &c.
That they could not but know he was much involved in Debts by the last War, in Conjunction with them, against Hol∣land, and other extraordinary Occasions, by Troubles arising, and fomented chiefly by his adhering to his Brother of France's Interest; and that he having Prorogued his Parliament upon his Account, and thereby put himself under an absolute Ne∣cessity of being deprived of the Legal Assistance of his People; it was but very reasonable and just they should advance such a Sum as might enable him, not only further to gratifie His Most Christian Ma∣jesty's Desires, but also to satisfie in part his own extraordinary Necessities, and re∣compence him for the Subsidies he miss'd of thereby again and again from his own Subjects. And Lastly, He demanded, at least, such a Re-inforcement as he had before receiv∣ed at the Conclusion of the Treaty with France, and that by way of Extraordina∣ry, besides his Annuity punctually paid: And of this he expected an exact Per∣formance before the——, be∣sides another Advance at the Beginning of that Session; that so he might be able to make his Party good against all Oppo∣sers at their next Meeting, or else Pro∣rogue them, without fear of wanting Mo∣ney during their Recess: And did further insist, beside some other Proposals not
worth mentioning, upon his having Five or Six Millions of Livres allowed him with all convenient Speed, towards the Payment of his Debts, and the Retriev∣ing of his lost Credit. The Success of which Remonstrances and Proposals, both from the King and Duke, your Lordship may, perhaps, be informed of another time, by My LORD, Your Honour's Most humbly devoted Servant. Paris, Mar. 16. 1680. N. S. LETTER LIV. Giving an Account, how far the French complied with the King and Duke's Remonstrances for Money; and how the same was resented by them. My LORD, YOur Lordship may refresh your Me∣mory, by calling to mind what I have some time since writ to you, con∣cerning the King, and his Brother the Duke's pressing of this Court for the Re∣mittances agreed on, and what further
Additions they wanted, for Negotiating of Businesses then in Agitation, with Cole∣man's Countermine to part of their De∣signs. I am now further to acquaint your Honour, that the fore-mentioned Impor∣tunities, together with those Cautions of Coleman, produced this Effect, that they sent about half as much Money as they had advanced at first to each of them; telling them at the same time, that the Most Christian King's Conveniency would not admit of a larger Remise at pre∣sent; neither could he do it with that Privacy he would, but by his Jews at Genoa; and therefore desired them to make what shift they could with that Pro∣portion, till the Event of the Parliament was seen, whether it were Prorogued, or no. But to the Duke they more particularly told, that if what was then remitted would not serve turn, and that he wanted more, rather than baulk his Designs, he might venture hardily on the Most Christian King's Word, to lay out of his own Store; that he should certainly be re-paid again at the time mentioned, with an Over∣plus: And that as for the Conversions he spake of, they waved them; and said, Father la Chaise and that Society had pro∣vided now a Fund for that Work, with∣out troubling them.
But to Coleman, not mentioning the Motion about Conversions, they only sent a good Gratuity for the Prorogation before, and about the Sum of Twenty Thousand Crowns Advance Extraordina∣ry, in order to hire an House, and to do other things, in order to the Corrupting of Parliament-men, &c. If he saw like∣lihood of it, he was to have—000 Crowns more, for to try Events; if he succeeded, he was promised—0000 be∣sides; and for a Prorogation when judged necessary, for so long as desired, another very considerable Sum, not particularly mentioned. How far any of the fore-mentioned Per∣sons did proceed, by way of Compliance with this Court, I know no otherwise for the present than thus, (in general) that they have noted the two Royal Brothers were a little disheartned to see their Friends on this side so backward to supply them; but that however, considering the Plausi∣bility of the French Excuses, and their own pressing Necessities, but more espe∣cially the King's, they not only took what was sent them, but resolved also to pro∣ceed to oblige the Messiurs as much as they could, to the end they might induce them by Performances to send them more. The Effects of which dangerous Complai∣sance, to say no worse of it, the Nation has but too much felt already; and God
knows where it will terminate: I am sure, your Lordship cannot but think it bodes ill; as does, My LORD, Your very Humble, and most Obedient Servant. Paris, Iune 4. 1680. N. S. LETTER LV. Of the Methods the Iesuites used to pro∣mote Conversions in England, and how St. Germain attempted King Charles II. With his Answer, &c. My LORD, I Need not tell your Lordship that Fa∣ther St. Germain, a Jesuite, and one cal∣led out on purpose by the French King's Confessor, was the head Manager of Con∣versions (as they called them) and of their other wicked Designs upon our Country under the covert of that; and who having gained Coleman, now a fellow Domestick, into a close Confidence and Compliance with him, soon found means to procure several other fit Complices, among the most considerable Orders and Parties of Men in the Kingdom, whether seated in, or resorting to the famous Metropolis
thereof; and the better to draw in the Men, they were very industrious in ply∣ing the Women of Quality most fit for intreague, to declare themselves for their Church, and under that pretence to make so many Partizans for France as they could; whose Grandeur chiefly they had in view, as to the best of my remembrance I have noted once and again to your Lordship: And not that of the Pope of Rome, or his Religion, which was only to serve for a Covert to the other, to the end their Pra∣ctices might not be discovered, or coun∣termined by the other foreign Ministers of that Communion. And so good success they had in those Jugling-proceedings, that it bred in them indeed too much confidence of their going through with the rest of their Work with the same ease, and so made them guilty of the weaknes∣ses of an over-hasty bragging and betray∣ing of the Secrets of their Measures, which in so jealous a Nation as England is, for a Jesuite, and a French one too to do it, was a very great Error in Policy; for St. Ger∣main, and his Gang, having met with such success in their work as they dreamed not of, they hence, after having made sure of the Duke, took the confidence to attempt the King himself, and were, as they ima∣gined, heard very favourably by him, ha∣ving been often told by him in Complement, that he looked upon their Religion as the
most politick, and that they had really made him so much a Convert, as to think that the Protestant Religion produced but ill Subjects, &c. But finding for all this that the effect was not answerable to the hope∣ful and favourable incouragement, that he could not be brought actually to declare for them, they oftentimes railed at him in private in England, and when any of them came over hither occasionally, the mildest Character they could give of him was, That he was a Prince that looked upon all Religion as a politick Cheat, to keep the World in awe, &c. but this was after∣wards; for before upon such Comple∣ments from the King, as aforesaid, they were so over joy'd, that it did indeed make them indiscreet upon it, so far as to make it almost their common and or∣dinary Discourse, not only to those alrea∣dy fixed in their Opinion, and that were of a stay'd and reserved Temper, but e∣ven to new Converts, and baulling talka∣tive Women; nay, and inserted it in their Letters too, both In-land and Foreign, that they had gained both Duke and King to their Religion; that they had fished in the British Ocean with such wonderful suc∣cess, that they fished now only for the greater Fish of all, leaving the small Fry to come of themselves, having already catcht two Royal Fishes (the Dolphin and Tung) with many such like Expressions;
and it was very ordinary with them in Conferences of Controversies, when they saw other Arguments have little effect, to urge the Example of the King and Duke; two such wise Princes as they represented them, who knew and understood perfect∣ly well the Principles of the Reformed Reli∣gion, and all the Arguments it was defen∣sible by, and yet had in a manner yeild∣ed to the invincible force of the Truth, which appeared on their side; and had, said they, against their Temporal Interests, to the evident hazards of their Persons and Dignities, to which they preferred the Welfare of their more precious Souls, em∣braced the Roman Catholick Opinions. Yea, St. Germain proceeded so far in this kind of vanity, that he was in a fair way to be ru∣ined for ever; but I have not leisure at this Juncture to observe to your Lordship the Passages and Effects of that Conduct, but must refer it to my next, wherein I hope I shall not fail you, who am My LORD, Your ever obliged, and most obedient Servant. Paris, Iuly 17. 1680. N. S.
LETTER LVI. St. Germain endeavouring to reclaim one Lusancy to the Church of Rome, whose Communion he had forsaken, used King Charles II's Turning Papist as an Argument; which the other disco∣vering, forced St. Germain to flee in∣to France, where he was punished for his Indiscretion for a Time. My LORD, IT was not without some Difficulty that I have been able to perform the Promi∣sory Clause of my last Letter, in reference to Father St. Germain's unseasonable Words concerning the King's Perversion to the Romish Church; who, among others, more particularly repeated the said Brags to a young Friar, then lately turned Protestant, in the Savoy, (as I learnt afterward;) and whom, for what peculiar Reasons I could never come to know, he laboured with more than ordinary Application to reclaim back again from his pretended Heresie, and at any rate to dispatch him back into France. That same young Friar went by the Name of Lusancy; but St. Germain said, his true Name was Beau-Chateau; and, it seems, had been St. Germain's Scholar formerly, when Regent in the College of Clermont,
in this City; and consequently, knowing more of St. Germain, than any other Man, perhaps, in England. It may be, the Fear of some Inconveniency to their Designs, by that Knowledge, and such Discourses as he might happen to have thereupon, was one Reason of the said Father's so great eagerness to remove him out of the way. In fine, How, de facto, and in truth, he managed the Business with him, I can∣not affirm; but certain it is, that Lusancy pretended, that upon his deferring, as the other thought, a little too much his full Compliance with his Desires, he offered him Violence; and, with several Accom∣plices, threatned to stab or pistol him if he would not sign such a Recantation as he presented, and go along with those he brought with him, in order to his imme∣diate Transportation: And that upon Com∣plaint thereof to the Parliament, then Sit∣ting, by a noble Lord, to whom Lusancy applied himself, and whom I need not name, I believe, to your Lordship, though perhaps you have never heard this Story before, in its full length, and by the Dis∣covery of some other of their Practices, the said Lusancy forced St. Germain to flee; and was the Cause of some Stir against Po∣pish Priests and Emissaries at that time; which were the Praeludium to what fol∣lowed afterwards, in the time of the late Conspiracy imputed to the said Party. And
no less certain it is on the other side, that St. Germain's Imprudence and ill Conduct, both in that and other things, was so de∣fenceless and inexcusable, that he was a long time in some Disgrace with the Duke and Dutchess, with Father la Chaise, and the whole Society of his Order; to whom he was forced, by a long and laborious Apology, to vindicate himself as well as he could; particularly, about the unhappy Af∣fair of Lusancy, and his rash and inconsi∣derate Speeches of the King and Duke of York, which he compiled with much Arti∣fice and Eloquence; and made me cloath it in the English Tongue, to the end he might satisfie his Friends of both Nations of his Innocence of those foul Aspersions cast upon him, as he would have it: Yet he could never so solidly refute what was so plainly objected against him, but that still there remained Causes sufficient to suspect, that the Assertions of such as ac∣cused him were not without some real Grounds. And indeed, though they were glad to have the same pass for a plausible Defence among Secular Persons, for their common Reputation, upon which that sub∣tile Society so much value and esteem them∣selves; yet within their own Cloisters they were so little satisfied with his specious Pleas, that they mulcted him, as they u∣sually do their own Members upon failure of Conduct, by sending him to and fro,
and employing him in low and contempti∣ble things, which only Juniors used to per∣form; and were a long time before they admitted him to any considerable Post a∣gain; though at last, after sufficient Morti∣fication, upon his uninterrupted and vehe∣ment Importunities, to be restored again once more to their good Opinion; and re∣peated Promises to be more assiduous in their Service, and careful of his Conduct for the future, and because he had been at first with Coleman, the chief Author of the Duke's being drawn into a close and separate Intrigue with the Court of France, by the Intervention of Father la Chaise, and knew best of any the Secrets and Mystery of it, he was again intrusted to manage the Continuation of that Correspondence, by the means of Coleman, his old Friend's receiving all Letters from him, and trans∣mitting all those of Father la Chaise and his Creatures in France, to Coleman and his Ma∣ster, and others with whom they had any Intrigue in England; among whom was one Lady Glascow, who received and dis∣persed most of the Letters which were not inclosed in Coleman's Pacquet, and which were commonly numerous enough, direct∣ed to her under six or seven several Names, changing every time, or every other time at least, the Name, and the Direction. Of which Correspondence I may, perhaps, be able to give your Lordship a fuller Account
another time; presuming this cannot but find Acceptance, though from so mean a Person as is, My LORD, Your Lordship's Most Devoted and Humble Servant. Paris, Sept. 2. 1680. N. S. LETTER LVII. Arguments used to the Duke of York, against Marrying his Daughter to the Prince of Orange. My LORD, I Confess, I do not well remember when it was that I gave your Lordship an Ac∣count of the Duke's being first drawn into a close Correspondence with France; and I am as much to seek how and when the following Arguments were urged upon him, no further than the Circumstance of the Subject does discover: But Time may unravel all. However, this, I find, was urged first on him: That it would be of equal Danger to His Royal Highness, if not more, to give his Daughter to the Prince of Orange, than to
let her be in the French Disposal; and that his Brother, the King, would be involved in equal Trouble on that Account, as on the other: For that if she were given to the Prince of Orange, without first enga∣ging him in the Interests of France, that thereby he would have a double Claim to the Crown; that of Course the King, his Brother, must be drawn into a War with France; and that by so doing, both the Royal Brethren would lose for ever the French King's Friendship and Support in case of Extremity, which they would infallibly be reduced to by such a War, or by but making a Shew of it; For if it went on, whether there were Cause, or no, there would be Jealousies of the Duke's Corre∣sponding with France; yea, and of the King too: And that, after all, such a Match would be interpreted but for a piece of Policy, only to hide from the People their Correspondence with France; and would never cure their Jealousies, nor take off the Fears they had of a Popish Succession by his new Dutchess; but add Strength and Courage to them to oppose Remedies against it. That thereupon, when they had the King once in a War, they would not give him any Money to carry it on, unless they saw the laying of it out, and had, in a manner, the Administration of the War in their own Hands; in which His Highness would be but a Cypher, and
would never be trusted. That then, not content with that, it was not to be doubt∣ed, but that the Exclusion of himself, and of his Heirs by the Second Bed, unless educated in the Protestant Religion, would likewise be hotly urged in the next place, in favour of a Protestant Prince so doubly Allied to the Crown of England, a profes∣sed Enemy of France, and a Native of Hol∣land, the Country, next their own, so much adored by them. That such an Alliance would strengthen that Faction, that was already but too strong. That such an Ex∣clusion being press'd, the King must either grant it, or deny it; if he granted it, as it was to be feared he might, then was His Highness, and the Heirs of his Religion, lost without Recovery; and then it would be out of the French King's Power, as well as Inclination, to assist him, after having been so disobliged, against the Power of England and Holland united; neither could he pro∣pose that Advantage to himself, be it as it will: That if the King should resist the said Importunity about Exclusion, that then he would expose himself to the Distractions of a Civil War, which might end both in the Ruin of the Royal Family, and the Mo∣narchy it self; for that the Republicans would not fail to lift up their Crests again in those Troubles: And that besides the In∣terest of the Prince of Orange, the Duke of Monmouth, being already very popular,
might be tempted by so fair an Opportu∣nity, to put in for a Pretender to the Suc∣cession; and that it was not impossible that the King, if he saw him favoured by the People, might be tempted too to prefer the Interest of a Son, before that of a Brother; and a Brother too, for whom he must be necessitated to undergo so much Vexation and Trouble, and run so great a Risque to defend. That in the mean while, England being in a War with France, that King, in∣stead of helping him, must be obliged, in his own Defence, to foment those Trou∣bles, and abet his Enemies. That perhaps he might think some of these Fears but imaginary; but that His Highness might assure himself, they had better Intelligence than he in that Case, and were very well satisfied that all the said Parties were ready disposed, and had concerted all their De∣signs against him; and that they were a∣betted by Men of the greatest power and Interest in the three Kingdoms; and then, of what Power and Influence such plausible and popular Pretensions would be among the People, when promoted and advanced by such Men, His Royal Highness could not be ignorant of. That therefore, all summed up, and du∣ly compared, the Dangers attending the Espousing his Daughter to the Prince of Orange were as great, if not considerably greater, than those that would be incurred
by giving her up to the Disposal of the French King; for more could not be feared from that, than what had been mention'd: Therefore they conjured him, as he ten∣der'd his own Good and Safety, or that of his Posterity, or of his Brother, or, lastly, of the hopeful Beginnings of the Catholick Religion in these Kingdoms, that he should be persuaded, and also persuade his Bro∣ther, to take the Council of France, both in the Disposal of the Princess, and other things relating thereto; for that the Danger of ad∣hering to the French King was no greater than that on the other side, but that the As∣sistance on his side would be great and powerful, as well as Cordial; whereas it never could be in the other Party's Power, much less in their Interest or Inclination, to afford him any Succour in his Troubles, but rather to add Oil to the Flame: And above all, never to be so rash, as to suffer himself to be tempted to consent to a War against France, for that the Factions would then have their Ends of him, as having a full Opportunity put into their hands thereby to compleat his Ruin without Controul. These were the Arguments used to His Royal Highness, against the March with the Prince of Orange: And with which I shall at present conclude, who am, My LORD, Your Lordship's Most Humble Servant. Paris, Aug. 4. 1679. N. S.
LETTER LVIII. Proposals made to the Duke of York, about consenting to have his Daughter, the Lady Mary, privately Trapanned into France, &c. My LORD, I Gave in my last to your Lordship a Re∣lation of the Remonstrances used to the Duke, in general, against his consenting to have his Daughter married to the Prince of Orange: I shall now endeavour to oblige your Lordship with some new Proposals made to him upon that Head. 1. That the Duke should use all the Power and Interest he had with the King, his Bro∣ther, to let his Daughter, the Lady Mary, take a Voyage into France, to take the Wa∣ters of Bourbon; or else to consent she might be privily sent away by the Duke, as against his Knowledge and Will; and that then they would get her speedily married; which putting things past Retrieve, Matters might the better, by good Management, be com∣posed, and made up to all their Satisfactions. 2. That to this purpose the French King would send a most splendid Embassy into England, of one of the chief Peers of his Realm, with a very numerous Train of choice Nobility. But if the King consent∣ed
publickly to that Proposition, the Prin∣cess might go over in the said Ambassa∣dor's Company: Or if he gave private Consent, she might be conveyed away, as in the first Article. 3. If the King should by no means con∣sent to it, that then the Duke should con∣trive a Way to get her seized and shipped off at the Ambassador's Departure, with∣out the King's Privity or Knowledge. 4. That if it were done by the King's Consent, the Sum of Five and twenty Mil∣lions of Livres should be, without fail, re∣mitted to him, at two Payments; the first, as soon as the Princess should arrive in the Kingdom of France; and the other, three Months after. And that the King and Duke in that Case should seem highly concerned, and disposed to declare War against France on that Account; and with the Money sent, raise Forces, as if it were for the War, and call to the Parliament for Mony to maintain it; which if they granted, to take it, (there was no doubt of their Consent to that:) After which, the French King was to send a ve∣ry submissive Embassage to England, offering to make ample Satisfaction for the Injury, and to strike up a Peace with Holland at any rate: Upon which, our King was to take upon him to be appeased, and to pretend the Dutch were in the fault that he did not make War. 5. That then, if there should happen any
Motions for Exclusion, that His Majesty might make use of the Money, and of the Forces raised as aforesaid, for his own Se∣curity: And that if any Rebellion hap∣pen'd, he might be assured, the French King would send him both Men and Money enough in case of Need. 6. That if it were done without the King's Consent, he, the Duke, should pre∣tend himself wholly ignorant of the Rape, and seem as much concerned as the King for Satisfaction. 7. But that if the King should be so dis∣pleased with His Highness, as to side with the adverse Party against him, after he had stood his Ground as long as he could, and made as many Friends as was possible, that then he should privately retire to Scotland or Ireland, and raise Arms there, where he should be powerfully assisted, both with Men and Money, from the French King; who would likewise use Means to raise Divisions among his Enemies, by several Methods they had concerted; and suddenly discou∣rage them all, by an unexpected Peace with Holland; tho' there was but little Prospect that Things should come to this Extremity. 8. That the Princess, still the better to appease the Heats in England, should, upon her Marriage, have, in ample manner, a Protestant Chapel allowed her; and that at the same time, the Protestants in the King∣dom of France should be used with extra∣ordinary
Kindness and Favour for her sake, till a general Peace, or other fi time to take off the Mask, were come. 9. That the better to take off the Edge of the English Fury to a War with France, besides the Peace to be made between the French and the Dutch, a third War was to be raised by the Hollanders, against England; and they put with might and main upon new Encroachments and Insolencies against the English. 10. That the better to cover all this, the Duke was not only to make a Semblance, but really to go to the Protestant Church again, and to give out with a full Cry, that he had been most maliciously tradu∣ced, and that he never was reconciled to the Church of Rome; and that his Non∣compliance in some things lately put upon him, did only arise in that he conceived such things were not to be imposed upon a Prince, as on a Subject. I have had the Opportunity, my Lord, to see several other things, of lesser Conse∣quence, projected here, for the Manage∣ment of this Affair to the Interest of the French Court; with which I shall not trou∣ble your Lordship, and remain, My LORD, Your very humble Servant. Paris, Aug. 13. 1679. N. S.
LETTER LIX. Arguments used by the French Emissa∣ries in England, to the Royal and Church of England Party, against the matching of the Lady Mary with the Prince of Orange. My LORD, THe French Emissaries finding (notwith∣standing the strong opposition made by them to the matching of the Lady Mary with his Highness the Prince of Orange, as I have some time since informed your Lordship,) that there was a very strong Current in the Nation for that Allyance, and having informed their Principals in the French Court therewith, they had fresh Instructions sent them, to gain, if possible, the time desired by them, which was till a General Peace were concluded, and to ply the Royalists, and high Members of the Church of England, not only close upon that Head, but their Instructions were re∣duced to these Branches. 1. They were to represent the Match as dishonourable, and too much reflecting on the Honour of Crowned Heads, to match a Daughter in so fair a way to be Heiress to three Crowns, to a Prince who was not only no Sovereign, but descended of a
Family which had distinguished it self chiefly by heading a Rebellion against his lawful Prince, and who was himself but the chief Officer of a Government so hate∣ful to all Kings, as a Common-Wealth, and that of one founded by Rebellion too; that such an Allyance must needs be more particularly dishonourable to the Royal Family of England, which had so lately and deeply suffered by a Rebellion mov∣ed against it by their own People, chiefly out of an Emulation to be like those Re∣bels; That indeed King Charles I. did match his Daughter to the present Prince of Orange's Father; but it was because he was involved in Troubles, and had not time or opportunity to dispose of her better, and thought by that Match to please the people, appease the Faction animated a∣gainst him, and by such a protestant Match allay the Jealousies conceived of his be∣ing popishly inclined, or having Leagued with popish Powers to their prejudice; and lastly, obtain some Assistance from the States of Holland in his Distress; and yet that after all his projection hereby, that Match was condemned by most of his Friends, as highly Dishonourable, and of very ill Example and Consequence, and is charged upon him as one of the great Errours of his Reign, and therefore by no means to be reiterated by a new one of the same kind.
2. They were to remonstrate, That the Prince of Orange was bred in Presbyterian Principles, and to exaggerate, with all the terrible Circumstances that could be sup∣posed, the danger the Church of England and Episcopacy would be in by the acces∣sion of such a Prince to the Crown; Pres∣byterians being no less passionate Enemies to the Church of England than Papists, and being much the more dangerous of the two, as being incomparably the more nu∣merous; the strange success they lately had in effecting so total a Subversion as they did of the Episcopal Church in the last Reign under rebellious Leaders, being too sensible a proof of both what they could, and what they would do again more effectually and more irrecoverably, when headed by a lawful Superior, and strengthned by the assistance of their Bre∣thren in Holland: This, my Lord, is the substance of the Instructions sent from hence to their Emissaries in England, for the managing of the forementioned part, and with which I shall conclude this Epistle, who am My LORD, Your Honours to serve You. Paris, Aug. 23. 1679. N. S.
LETTER LX. Instructions given to the French Emissa∣ries, whereby to manage the Dissen∣ters and Republican Party in Eng∣land, in reference to the Prince of Orange's matching with the Lady Mary. My LORD, I Have in my last given your Lordship an Account of the French Intrigues, in managing the Royal and Church of Eng∣land Party, in respect to the March with the Prince of Orange; here follows their Instructions to their Agents, with the Dis∣senters and Republican Party upon the same Head. To them they were to use many of the Arguments used to those of Holland, of which hereafter; and make them be∣lieve, if they could, that if the P. of Orange should come to the Crown of England, not∣withstanding his Humility now, he would fly higher at Absolute Power than any be∣fore him, or that the present King, or his Brother, could; that under an humble appearance he subtilly hid an aspiring Mind, and that having in many things encroached already upon the Power of the States General, he would totally oppress them, and by that accession of Strength
raise his Authority in England to what pitch he pleased, and Adieu to all hopes of a Common-wealth there, when that of Holland should be subject to his Scepter, and Adieu to all expectation of making Presbytery the predominant Religion there; for that it was almost incompatible with a moderate Monarchy, much less with Ab∣solute Power; and that whatever Princi∣ples the Prince had been bred in, as to Religion, though he might like them well enough as a Member of a State, with whose Constitutions they perfectly agreed; it was not to be doubted, that when he came to be a Monarch, and so powerful an one too, as the United Provinces thrown into the weight of three Crowns would make him, but he would, like most Prin∣ces, make his Religion conform to the Model of his Politicks, and when he became a Monarch, and so great an one too, take up Monarchs principles, which could be no other than Popish, or such as exceed them, if possible, in maligni∣ty, viz. Those of the Tantivy Sons of the Church of England, none else agreeing with despotick Rule; so that whatever hopes they might flatter themselves with from such a Match, and the Prince's ac∣cession to the Throne; they should find themselves so far disappointed, as not to have any reason left them to expect as much as a Tolleration in Religion, and the Freedom
of their Consciences: Which with my humble Respects to your Lordship, is all I have to Communicate at this time, who am in all lowly Observance, My LORD, Your Honour's to Command. Paris, Sept. 5. 1679. N. S. POST-SCRIPT. My LORD, SInce I had finished my Letter, I hap∣pening occasionally to run over some of our Minutes, I thought fit to sub-join what I meet with there briefly inserted, in order to the management of meer Po∣liticians and Adiaphorites in Religion, up∣on the account of the Prince's Match; and to them the forementioned Emissaries were to suggest on the contrary, that the Prince though he should in time by virtue of the said Match come to be King of England, yet that it could not be thought but that still he would continue a Dutch-Man in all his Inclinations, sacrifice our Commerce and Interest to those of that Nation; yea, and perhaps part with the chief Prerogatives of the Crown to make the King of England like a Doge of Venice,
or Dutch Stadt-holder, &c. which though sufficiently ridiculous I could not forbear noting to your Lordship, who am My LORD, Yours, &c. LETTER LXI. The Arguments used in Holland by the French Emissaries to the Lovestein Faction against the Prince of Orange's matching with the Lady Mary, &c. My LORD, IF it was any pleasure to your Lordship to peruse the Accounts I have already given you, of the Stratagems of this Court to incite the Church of England and Dis∣senting Parties against the Match with the Prince of Orange, as I am desirous, and I hope not unwilling, to interpret your si∣lence in that regard to imply it; I cannot think it will be less to your Honour's sa∣tisfaction, to understand how they mana∣ged the same Affair in Holland, where no less Subtilty and Address was wanting than in England to divert a Match, that predicted no good Omen to France, as they imagined; the Party in that Repub∣lick
which their Emissaries had Instructi∣ons to work upon, were the Lovestein Fa∣ction, to whom nevertheless they were to address themselves very cautiously and co∣vertly, and first to insinuate to them, and by them to the State-Party. That indeed it was true the Illustrious Princes of the House of Nassau had not only been the first Founders, but also the great preservers of their Common-wealth, and that it could not be denied but that the present Prince of Orange had very much contributed to its late Recovery, after it had been brought to the very brink of Destruction; and that they were fully convinced that same Family must remain a necessary Bulwark to their Com∣mon-wealth, so long as their Interests should continue inseperably intwisted with those of the State; but if they should be so blinded as to consent, or but tacitely give way to any Steps that might alter those of the Prince into any other Channel; that same House might, in process of time, prove the fatal Cadency and Dissolution, as it had been the happy Rise and Glory of that flourishing State. That the implacabi∣lity of the Spanish Royal Family against those that have once offended them, and their bloody and unjust Proscription of the noble House of Orange, had so firmly ce∣mented the Interests of the Princes of that Family with those of the States during the
Wars with Spain, that there could not pos∣sibly any Danger arise to them from that House, how much soever they were in∣trusted with the Authority of the States, they being then best secured by the Great∣ness and Power of that. Nay, and that after the Peace made between that Repub∣lick, and the Crown of Spain, there could be no Danger from those Princes neither, so long as they matched into inferior Prin∣ces Families, as those of Germany, &c. which might add Strength, but never could Power enough to the Princes of Orange to crush the State, or in the least divide from its true Interests. But that it might be of the dangerousest Consequence, if any of them were suffered to match into the Fa∣mily of any Crowned Head, and especial∣ly of any near Neighbour to the Repub∣lick; for that would be an effectual Means to fill their Heads with aspiring Thoughts, and great Designs to Aggrandize themselves, and might afford them Power enough to put them in Execution; a Temptation too strong for almost any active spirited Prince to resist: And therefore such an one as this present Prince ought by no means to be exposed to by any wise States-men, whose Interest it was to keep him from it, and who had Cunning enough to put him by it. That never any of His present High∣ness's Predecessors have been ever as much as suspected of aspiring at any Power over
the Commonwealth; but what tended to its greater Security, and for the Elevation of the Majesty of the Republick, without the least Glances of assuming any to them∣selves, unless it were His Highness's Fa∣ther; who, in all probability, was anima∣ted thereunto by his matching with a Daughter of England: And that his Ambi∣tion might have proved fatal to the Re∣publick, beyond Retrieve, if his immature Death, and other seasonable Providences, had not intervened. That the Influence of that Match had proved very detrimen∣tal to that illustrious House, by stirring up such a Jealousie in the States against them, as would not suffer them to admit the pre∣sent Prince, for a long time, to enjoy the Places of Honour, Authority and Trust formerly so well maintained and officiated by his noble Ancestors: And that, at the same time, it had proved as pernicious to the States themselves, in creating and nou∣rishing Factions among them, and Endea∣vours to keep up the Republick upon a new Model, without Captain-General, Stadt∣holder, Admiral, &c. and to deprive them∣selves of the so necessary and Auspicious Assistance and Conduct of that most Illu∣strious House; and thereby exposed even almost to be made a Prey to the dangerous Ambition of the French Monarch. And therefore now, when they had so newly re-enter'd into their true Interests,
and happily re-fixed all things on the old Foundation, by restoring the present Prince to the Dignity of his Ancestors, and call∣ing him to the Helm of the Tempest-bea∣ten State, and had by his Courage, Con∣duct and Interest recovered the Common∣wealth to a very hopeful Condition of Power and Prosperity again, it would be no less than a Madness to venture the Ruin of all those fair Hopes, by a second Match with England, when by the former they had been almost all Shipwrack'd; and to suffer a Prince who was now wholly their own, to espouse, in such a Marriage as was then in Agitation, a Foreign Interest; and such as, in all probability, could not, in time, but interfere with theirs: And therefore desired it might not be. 1. Because, though the Prince's Inten∣tions should happen to continue never so right and firm to the Interest of the Re∣publick, yet this Match could not but be still very detrimental both to him and them, by causing incurable Jealousies, Fa∣ctions and Animosities amongst them, without end; and which could not but be of pernicious Consequence to them both. 2. That by reason of the little probabi∣lity of the Duke of York's having any Vi∣vacious Male Issue, this would give the Prince such a near Prospect of the British Crowns, that it could not but engage him, in that View, upon all Occasions, to strain
his Power and Interest in the United Pro∣vinces to the utmost for the advantage of the English Nation, to the prejudice of the Dutch increase of Power and Interest. 3. That if he ever came to be King of England, the Power he would thereby ob∣tain, added to that he had already in the United Provinces as Stadt-holder, Captain General, &c. and to the great Influence he had among the Soldiery in the States pay, would undoubtedly be a great temp∣tation to him for to reduce that State un∣der the English Crown, and influence the others to assist him in it; And that if he should have Issue by his Princess, as it was likely enough he might, the danger under that Circumstance would be in a manner inevitable. Its likely, my Lord, our Politicians here forsaw very great Difficulties would arise in making any manner of Impressions up∣on the States against the Prince's Match, for by the foresaid Remonstrances it does appear to me their Master-battery was turned on that side; but though all their Politicks have failed them for the preven∣tion of the Marriage, yet they have not failed to put some of these Arguments foards, to render the Prince, and all his Proceedings suspect to the States, and they have already bragged; that all the Constancy his Highness is well known to be Master of, will find work enough to
ver-come the Jealousies entertained of him, (and which they are resolved never to be wanting on their part to foment) and to make it believe that all he has acted since his marriage has been to the aggrandizing of himself and his Authority, and the Di∣minution of that of the Republick; I fear I have already too much transgrest by my tediousness, and shall therefore only subscribe my self, as I am in sincerity My LORD, Your Lordships, Most humble Servant. Paris, Sept. 20. 1679. N. S. LETTER LXII. Of the Solemn Embassy sent by the French King to King Charles II. in the Year 1677, in order to break off the Match with the Prince of Orange, &c. My LORD, PUrsuant to what I have already men∣tioned to your Lordship of the De∣signs concerted between his Royal High∣ness, and the French King, about getting of the Lady Mary, by a Stratagem, into France, if their other Measures about hin∣dring
the Match were broken, was the late solemn Embassy sent over from hence into England, whereof the Count d' Estree was the head, accompanied with the Duke de Vendosme, the Archbishop of Rheims, one of our great Minister, the Marquiss de Lou∣vois's Sons, and at least fifty Lords more of principal Note; and whose publick in∣structions, tho' they imported nothing more then a great Complement, and some overtures about forbiding any recruits, to be sent over to our Land Forces in the service of the Confederates; yet privately they were to endeavour a French match, and if they saw they could not succeed therein, to concert closer measures with the Duke, about puting in practise what he had before consented to, about geting the Princess his daughter privately con∣vey'd away, in Company of this Embassador into France; and perhaps your Lordship will not be dissatisfied, if I recount what I have heard discoursed one day at this Court, between our Commissioner and some other Courtiers concerning the Em∣bassy. Said one of them to theother, What needed so splendid and costly an Embassy at this time of day to the King of England, when there is so little hopes that he durst give his Consent to what we de∣sire of him; if he were of himself dis∣posed thereto: Yes, says the other, 'Twill be well worth the Cost let things go as
they will upon this occasion, for 'tis a greater honour our King now does to the King of England, than he has ever yet done to any other Prince, or ever to the Emperor himself when at Peace with him; and such an Honour cannot but work sen∣sibly upon the heart of a Prince, who is so easily wrought upon, and may work some good Effects for us in time, if not for the present; And however, if the worst come to the worst, this extraordinary Honour now done him by our Monarch, will make his Parliament and People so fully persuaded that he hath entred into an extraordinary Engagement with him, that all he can say, or do, will never convince them of the contrary, or induce them to trust him with Money to make War a∣gainst France, for fear he should use it against themselves; and not only so, but it would make him as suspected among the Confederates, that none of them, from hence forward, would trust him, either for an Assistant Allie, or Mediator, and so would render him of insignificant force to thwart our Designs. But the King did for once Trick the Trickers, by the care he had taken of the Princess, as I shall note elsewhere to your Lordship, and by his sudden marrying her to his Highness the Prince of Orange, so much to the surprize and disappointment of this Court, that I
cannot express it, and therefore must con∣clude, subscribing my self My LORD, Your Lordship's most humble and most devoted Servant. Paris, Dece. 7. 1679. N. S. LETTER LXIII. Of the Popish Plot, and Father Kelley's Menaces. My LORD, THE discourse about the Plot cannot be more in England than 'tis here, but the Particulars of the prosecution of it, your Lordship must know much better than I; I do not question, but there is Villany enough at the bottom of it, but our Ministers are as deep in the sudds as any other whatsoever, who by their slights, and wicked practises, have drawn the Eng∣lish Papists into such Combinations, as hath put the Nation into such ferments, in∣curable Jealousies and divisions, as hath effe∣ctually diverted the English from hunting the French in Flanders, by imploying them to hunt the Papists, and Jesuits at home, as they have been pleased to word it: My Lord,
It may not perhaps be unpleasing to give your Honour an account of some passages that happened between one Father Kelley an Irish Priest, and my self in this City lately concerning the King, &c. I know very well, that there were, and and perhaps may be still some of that name in England, but this same has lived for some years at Paris, by St. Jean de Greve; and tho' a Priest is a great Banker, paying most of the pensions for secret service transmitted to the English Romanists, but chiefly to Irish Papists in England and Ire∣land, and who by his discourse upon the late English Fleet and Armies being ready, and the War likely to be declared against this Kingdom, was pleased then to say somewhat in relation to this Conspiracy, that I have little thought on till very lately, and that may give your Honour some light into the designs of this Court; say'd he, the King of France will find him (meaning our King) work enough by Divisions at home, and discovering, if needs be, his and his Bro∣thers intreagues in France, and does not care tho' he expose all the Roman Catholicks in the three Kingdoms, to a general and hot persecution, so long as, like the Turkish Asaphi, they serve to blunt the English Men's fury, and divert them from thwart∣ing the designs of the potent Catholick Kingdom of France, which would after∣ward set all right again, but that he was
in hopes by their hunting of Papists, they would never leave hunting the King and his Brother too, if they proved refractory, till they had brought them to take Sanctu∣ary in a stricter Alliance with the French King than ever, as their only Safe-guard; and that it was in the French King's power to spring up a Plot next day, to give the King of England Game enough for his life time, for that the Mines and Trains were already lay'd, and that there needed only putting fire to them, &c. I am very sor∣ry I could not have oblieged your Lord∣ship sooner with these passages, which yet I hope comes not too late, but it may in some measure be grateful from My LORD, Your Humble Servant. Paris, Feb. 28. 1678. N. S. LETTER LXIV. Of the Duke of York's being Comman∣ded to retire to Bruxells in the Year 1679, and of the Promises made him by the King before his departure. My LORD, I Know not how Matters go in England, nor what the Sence of the people is in general concern the Duke's retiring to
Bruxells, but I can assure your Lordship, they seem to be mightily allarmed here at it, tho' they put a good meen upon it. Perhaps your Lordship may know much more of the Secret of this Journey than I can in∣form you, but if what is transmitted hi∣ther by the Agents of our Grand Minister be acceptable, they give us this account: That the Earl of D—was the person who advised the King to remove his Roy∣al Highness from his presence, and that his Reasons for it were, that the Parlia∣ment might have no pretence for to com∣plain of his Majesty, that he had not ta∣ken all the Measures necessary for the Se∣curity of their Religion and Liberty; but they tell us, how true, I leave it to your Lordships profound Judgment to deter∣mine, that the Earl by the foresaid Ad∣vise did not so much consult the King and Kingdoms true Interest, as he did to please the Parliament, with whom he was at odds, because of the Money received to disband the Army, and the French Alli∣ance; finding now by Experience, that that Artifice of his in bringing the Plot upon the stage in order to amuse them, had fail∣ed; They further inform us, that the Duke was mightily surprized at the Message for his departure, and made some difficulty to bring himself to resolve to obey it, but that at length recollecting a better Tem∣per, it gave his fast friends an Oppor∣tunity
to advise him; That though it were at that juncture necessary he should obey the King, yet it was no less prudent that he should, in so doing, take all ne∣cessary Precautions, not to abandon his Fortune to the discretion of his Enemies; that they did not doubt but that the Duke of Monmouth would push hard, to get him∣self declared Legitimate by the ensuing Parliament; That the business of the Ex∣clusion would be renewed, and that there was room enough to fear, least his Retreat might be rather interpreted for the flight of a guilty Person, than for the Obedi∣ence of a submissive Subject; that there∣fore it was expedient he should get the King first to promise him that he would declare, and get it Recorded too in the Courts of Justice, that he had never been Married to the Duke of Monmouth's Mo∣ther; That he would by no means con∣sent to the Exclusion that was now likely to be prest upon him; and lastly, that he should give him express Order in writing to require his Retirement. All which, they say, he has happily accomplished, the truth whereof time must determine, where∣unto I leave it, who am My LORD, Your Humble Servant. Paris, Apr. 6. 1679. N. S.
LETTER LXV. Of the Noise of King Charles's Divorce from Queen Katherine. My LORD, THE business of the King's Divorce has made a mighty noise on this side, and I cannot with any certainty in∣form your Lordship, which way this Court stands affected; for I find, on the one hand, Instructions given to their Agents in England to insinuate to the King, but yet very tenderly, what a piece of Unjustice it would be so to disgrace an innocent harmless Princess, to whom he had been lawfully married, and who had, with so much patience, bore the Infirmities that attended him; and that the consequent of such a Divorce would perhaps be worse than the Divorce it self, seeing a Brother would be baulked of the just hopes he had, after his Majesty's death, of ascend∣ing the English Throne, &c. But since, my Lord, having found the Parliament, and Privy Council, disposed very much to fa∣vour such an Action, they gave their Emissaries, of another stamp, directions to incite the King to it, and to promise to find him out a Princess of this Courts re∣commendation
and procurement, in hopes, by that means, to set the two Brothers at variance, and to raise new Factions and Disputes about Succession; and if they saw he would not consent, yet they had their Creatures ready to whisper it in the Duke's ear as a great secret, that if it were not for them, he would have consented there∣unto; but how far these Politicks have been practised, your Lordship can observe much better than I at such a distance, who am My LORD, Your ever obliged, and most humble Servant. Paris, Mar. 2. 1680. N. S.
LETTER LXVI. Of the Earl of Shaftsbury's being Ca∣lumniated by the French Agents to King Charles II. in order to put him out from being President of the Council, and from all Publick Administration. My LORD, THE joy conceived by the Ministers of this Court, at the displacing of my Lord of Shaftsbury from his great Of∣fice of President of the King's Council, and consequently from all Administration of Publick Affairs, is as open and unexpres∣sible as the Instruments and Causes of such a change are secret; but so far as I have had any intelligence of this grand Affair, which I predict to be no good Omen to our poor Country, I am free, and I hold my self in duty bound to communicate to your Lordship; who perhaps will not much wonder at such a change, when I tell you that the Emissaries of this Court, but more especially the women kind, whom I need not Name, have incessantly as they have been taught their Lessons,
been buzzing the King in the Ears with such Calumnies and Accusation, as here follow according as they are inserted here. They were to lay hold on all opportu∣nities, to render the said Noble Lord ob∣noxious to the King, but yet to be very tender in their first attack, and therefore frequently to say; That truly his President was a person of incomparable Parts and Abilities in matters of State, and that to do him Justice, he had done his Prince as im∣portant service as any of his Subjects; That though he had in former times fallen in with the republican interest, which was then predominant in the Nation; yet he had since shewed so much Zeal for the Monarchy, as might justly obliterate all former miscarriages; provided still he proved constant in his Devoir, and gave no suspition of his being inclinable to re-as∣sume the principles, which he seemed once so entirely to have forsaken; and when they had again and again made way by such insinuations as these for more despe∣rate Attacks; They urged his Majesty might call to mind the time and occasion when, as well as of whom the Earl had once said, that when a man is wanting to himself, he deserves that others should be so to him also; and he might consider how false and
dangerous a Maxime that was, when it re∣ferr'd to a Prince or ones Country, to whom one is never allowed to be want∣ing; That the Earl had been as good as his word, was already sufficiently manifest, when he had discovered in Parliament the secret motives that had engaged the King to grant Liberty of Conscience before the late War, as well as his Alliance with France, and insinuated the designs his Ma∣jesty had to retrench the liberty of Parlia∣ments, which was indeed no more then to reduce that Assembly within the bounds of their Duty; that his conduct ever since in promoting the Test, &c. gave no small Umbrage that he meant more then a bare exclusion of his Royal Highness from publick Offices; That they could not be positive that a change of Government was design∣ed thereby, and a new essay for the mon∣strous Metamorphosis of the Monarchy in∣to a Republick once more; but that surely, it looked that way; For if the thing were considered aright, the King, 'twas true, was an Established Prince, and now long in possession, and in whose person there could be no plausible pretence to induce the people to abandon that form of Go∣vernment; and for the Regal power it self, the time was yet too short since a Compa∣ny of Tyrants had plunged the State into Troubles, for to propose an entire aboli∣tion
of King's a second time, seeing those very persons who went under the notion of Republicans, did not so much yet aim for the most part at the change of the form of the Monarchical Government, as at the diminution of the Authority; and hence it might be reasonably inferred, that the Earl well foreseeing he could not pro∣ceed directly to that which he aimed at, began cunningly to take a round which he judged would conduct him with more safety to the same end: And that seeing no possibility of dispossessing the King, he had formed a design to disinherit the person that ought to succeed him, being assu∣red that the best expedient to destroy the regal Dignity, was to disturb the order of Succession; And that his Majesty must needs foresee the dangers arising from the Coun∣sells of so pernicious a Man, whose autho∣rity in Court, Parliament and City was equally formidable as his Pollicy. I will not take upon me to determine what great services his Majesty has lost by the discarding of this great Statesman, he may want it in time, and be better perswa∣ded then ever of the Character himself has given once of him upon his resolution of a difficult Case, viz. That he had a Chan∣cellor who knew more Law than all his Judges, and more Divinity than all his
Bishops; if these particulars be not new to your Lordship, I desire to know it, that I may be more cautious for the future in my Intelligence, wherein I always aim at pleasing your Lordship, Who am Your humble Servant. Paris, Aug. 29th, 1681.
LETTER LXVII. Of the Duke of York's being in France Twice, and Closetted by the French King. His Rencounter with the French Ambassadour Barillon. His Wives ill success in France. Her Petition to the French King. Return without Relief, and her fatal End. My Lord, HAD I been able to have given your Lordship some remarkable passages relating to the Duke, and Mr. Coleman's History, in the time the great Affair of the Popish Plot was in Vogue and Agitation, I do not doubt but I should have perform'd a grateful part to you; yet I find some∣thing so singular and diverting therein, that I cannot but flatter my self, it will still, in some measure, prove agreeable. Mr. Cole∣man had, for a long time, manag'd the In∣trigues between the French and English Courts, and that your Lordship well knows, for his Letters that were seiz'd and publisht make it evident; and he was one of the chief Instruments to draw his Master, the Duke of York, into so close a Corres∣pondence with them as he was ingag'd in, of which your Lordship has heard before; and from the Year 1676, to near the time he
was Arraign'd and Condemn'd for the Po∣pish Plot; I am free to acquaint you, my Lord, That all his Letters past through my hands, being first directed to a French Gen∣tleman, who took care to transmit them to me, with Orders to send them to Father St. Germain, who manag'd all Affairs be∣tween him and Father La Choise, but I saw the Contents of few or none of them, till lately I have found them among other things of that kind in the Minutes of our French Secretary, and which is the Reason your Lordship has not receiv'd this Account sooner, at which, I am sure, you cannot but stand astonished, as I was my self, when I acquaint you, that I find it entred here, that the Duke of York was, during this famous Correspondence, two several times in France, and Closetted to boot, by his Most Christian Majesty (which, by the way, unfolds the Mystery of the Proposals I have former∣ly mentioned, about Trapanning the Princes into France) but it was both times by Night, and the Works of Darkness, between One and Two of the Clock in the Morning, tru∣sty persons being ready posted to Introduce him: And one time a Councellor of the Parliament of Paris to whom, Some of Cole∣man's Letters were directed, happening ac∣cidentally to let fall an Expression, intima∣ting, That the Duke of York was come thi∣ther in Person, tho' it was Voic'd up and down among the Courtiers it was Coleman;
he receiv'd a very severe Check for his unsea∣sonable Inadvertence; and, as a farther pu∣nishment, he had no more any Secrets com∣municated to him: for, the Letters from thenceforward were distributed by another way. The first time the Duke was Closet∣ted, was a little before the second Dutch War, to concert Measures, how he should he enabled to induce his Brother to give his Consent to it to promote the French Designs thereby; as was likewise our Famous Ad∣miral Sir Edward Spragg, for the same pur∣pose, not very long after the Duke. The second time was a little before the Splendid and Extraordinary French Embassy was sent into England, and wherein Measures were Concerted how to induce our King to give his Consent to have the Princess Mary Mar∣ried into France; and, in case that would not do, how to Steal her, and send her away when they went off; but this Intrigue com∣ing to be privately discover'd to the King, by one of the Duke's great Confidents, he had the Cunning to dissemble the matter, and took no manner of notice of it to the Duke his Brother, but gave secret Orders that a strict Eye and a good Guard should be kept over the Princess, and would not permit the Duke to have her abroad upon a∣ny Invitations, or other pretence whatsoe∣ver, till the Embassadors were quite gone; saying, It would administer Iealousie to His People, if She should be permitted to stir abroad
much, while the French Sparks continued in England. And to prevent the like Plots upon her for the future, and to please His People, who were now upon the fret, and, as they would have it here out of Displea∣sure against such an Indirect and Rash Pro∣cedure, which, had it taken effect, as he said, would have dashed him and his Govern∣ment in an Instant upon an inevitable Rock, he Married Her, as your Lordship well re∣members, to the Prince of Orange, to the great Regret and Vexation of the French Court, and of the Duke too, who, from thenceforward hath not cared how almost he exposed the King his Brother, by engaging of Him in continual Troubles for his sake, nor how closely he United with the French Fa∣ction, who afterward wreakt their Revenge for some time upon the Duke himself, but chiefly upon the King, by their Intrigues, in bringing the following Popish Plot upon the Stage: Both the times the Duke was on this side, the King knew not of, or at least they design'd He should believe so, but thought he was retir'd for Indisposion, yet both times he brought Remittances for con∣siderable Sums of Money; yet the French were highly displeased at him for his failure in the aforesaid Match, and the subsequent Plot upon his Daughter; so far, as that they Suspended his Pensions, as they likewise did Coleman's, which made them both incline to Revolt to the Spanish Faction, and moved
the Duke to some seeming willingness to go over, and Command the English Forces in Flanders, in the War then likely to be de∣clared from England against France; for which they were cruelly revenged upon Mr. Coleman, by contriving his Ruin and Death; and against the Duke of York too, by the dis∣covery of the Popish Plot, in which they were highly Instrumental, and by imploying the Dutchess of Portsmouth, and some other of their Creatures in our Court, which were bi∣gotted to their Interests, to promote the Bill of Exclusion, that so that Prince might be brought under a necessity, as they thought, to return to, and absolutely to rely upon them; for when, in those Troublesom Times, the Duke was forced to retire to Bruxells, the French King was heard to say, That had he follow'd his Counsel, and been constant to him, he should not have needed to have retir'd to Bruxells, or to any other place but France. But however, I find all was accommodated again afterward, and the Duke got closer in with them than ever, when the Whig∣party, as they call'd it, was quash'd, and things were ripe for another Plot, called. The Pr.—one. But however, before that Breach we have spoken of with the Duke and Coleman, they were resolv'd first to get some Service out of them; for, find∣ing, after the Allyance with Holland, that our King was somewhat inclin'd to comply with His Parliaments and Peoples Instances,
well as those made to Him by the Confede∣rate Ministers in Declaring a War in con∣junction with them against France, as ap∣pear'd by His Speech to the Parliament; But more by their Voting a Fleet of Ninety Capital Men of War, and an Army of Nine and twenty thousand Land-soldiers for that purpose: of all which it does appear, Cole∣man sent over hither a speedy Account; They then presently Renewed their Pensi∣ons to him, and to the Duke for some time, with a Solemn Promise of a considerable Sum by way of Gratuity besides, if they could so far prevail, as to sow such Dissen∣tions between the King and Parliament, as might hinder those Preparations by being seconded by an Actual Declaration of War, which they did effectually; for they had, by their Creatures, inspired into the heads of the most Stirring and Active Members of the House, that the Pretence of War against France, was only a Court-trick to get Mo∣ney, and a Standing Army to Enslave the Nation; and therefore it were not their best way to trust the King with Money for that purpose, unless it were at certain moderate Sums, and with such Limitations as might Secure them from any Arbitrary Deligns, and from Intrigues with the French; and at the same time it was Infused, with much Artifice, into the King's Head, That if he once ventured on a War against France without an Unconditional Vote for
sufficient supplies, and that in very con∣siderable Sums at once; as for example, of so much yearly as long as the War last∣ed; that he was an undone and lost Man, and would, by that false step, be infallibly unhinged; by which Artifices a Declara∣tion of War against France was so long protracted, till the Hollanders despairing of any good from England, were necessita∣ted to clap up a Separate Peace (which the French, with all diligence, proposed to them) whilst the King and Parliament in England were disputing the Case about Funds for the War. My Lord, I have been necessitated to recapitulate some things here, which I remember I have Written a Larger Account of to your Lordship, and that because I could not well other∣wise have brought in the succeeding part of Mr. Coleman's History, who, to say no∣thing of the Duke, having effected the foremention'd Divisions, Jealousies and Disputes, claim'd his Promised Reward of Monsieur Barillon, the French Ambas∣sador at London, having yet received but one Payment of it; but the slie Mon∣sieur finding his Business was so far done, that he was able to go on with the rest himself without their assistance, put him off at first with Fair Words, but Cole∣man still Renewing his Instances, Ba∣rillon began to slight his Applications, and at last told him, in Down-right
Terms, he had no Orders to Pay him a∣ny more Money; That he had Receiv'd enough for the Business he had done; since there were other Instruments which he had there, who had done more, and been much more Serviceable in it than himself; and, in a word, That his Master, the French King, had no further occasion for the Service of such a Sawcy, Imperti∣nent, and Inconsiderable Fellow as he was: Coleman was Netled to the Quick at this Unexpected Treatment, which he conceived he had not deserved at their hands; and therefore he reply'd again as warmly, saying, That for his part he had neglected much greater Rewards then what he demanded of him, and which was his Iust Due, which he might have had from the Con∣federate Party; and that now since he found he was so slighted, he should take care to let them see they should find the miss of his Servi∣ces, by what he would, and was resolv'd to do for the other side, and that he question'd not but to bring the Duke his Master to be quickly of his Mind: Barillon thereupon answer'd, That his Master would be sure to find them such Im∣ployment in a short time, that they should have no leasure to think of serving the Confederates, or hunting the French in Flanders, having already such a pack of Hounds in a readiness, as would quickly snap him, and hunt his Ma∣ster too off his Legs, if he did but offer to
depart so much from his own Interest as to quit theirs. After this mutual Huff, Coleman going to take his Leave of Monsieur Barillon, the Frenchman retaining still a spice of French Civility, came to attend him to the Gate, where, seeing Coleman's Coach standing right before it; Sir, said he, briskly to him, What is the meaning of this, that your Coach stands right before my Door, that is no place for a person of your mean station and qua∣lity. That's strange, Monsieur, Answer'd Coleman, I should be of meaner quality now, then I used to be; there, you know well enough, it used to stand; But pray where would you have it to stand then, continu'd he? Two or three doors off, cry'd Barillon: So indeed, said Coleman, I used to place it, when I went to a Baw∣dy-house, but I did not take yours to be such till now, and so adiew. It was but a few days after this rencounter, my Lord, that Coleman was seized for the Popish Plot, at the news of which, the Discourse was at the French Secretaries, that Coleman would certain∣ly pay dear for having adventured to displease the King their Master; for that they had perswaded the Conceited Fool to keep his Papers all by him, which they flat∣ter'd him, were Rare Compositions, and
Specimens of incomparable Wit and Parts, in which they said were things, not only enough to hang him out of the way, but so to hamper the King and Duke too, and in∣volve them in such Troubles, that they would be glad to quit all their thoughts of leaning towards the Confederates, and so return again to their interests at last, as most expedient for them; and that they had im∣ployed such Tools as would not fail to Dis∣cover all their Inttigues, and be in spight of their Teeth, forc'd to acts of Repentance and sorrow for what they had done: And in fine, when Coleman was Condemn'd, and the Duke would have interpos'd for a Par∣don for him, Monsieur Barillon oppos'd it Tooth and Nail, and said, He ought to be Sacrificed upon that occasion, and that if he were not, the King his Master would find means to have a worse Discovery made, than all that had yet been made to appear out of his Papers or otherwise: After Coleman was Hang'd, his Wife reduc'd to a forlorn state, retir'd into France, and presented a Petition to the French King to this effect. That whereas her late Husband, besides his many other good and timous services done to his most Christian Majesty, had upon his instances by his Minister at London, hired an House in Deans-yard in Westminster, of a considerable Rent, some time before that Session of Parliament wherein the matter of a War against the King∣dom of France was to be debated and agitated,
for the better convenience of Treating some Members of Parliament, and some other Gentle∣men that had influence over them; That he had expended considerable Sums of Mony that way, as he had done in like manner among other use∣ful instruments he had in the Country as well as the City for promoting his Majesties Service in England, for which he had declined much great∣er Rewards from the Spanish, Imperial, and Dutch Ministers, and other Agents, than he expected or desired from him, whom he served more by inclination than Interest; and that he had had the good Fortune happily to effect the great task imposed on him by his most Christian Majesties Commands, in dividing the King of England and his Parliament, and breaking the neck of the intended War against France; that yet for all that, when his work was accomplish'd, Monsieur Barillon had refused to pay him his ex∣pences, and never had given him one quarter of the Su he was to have had for that Affair, and much less, the Expences he had been at; And that now at last he had lost his dear Life for serving his Majesty, by which sad disaster, she and her Family being ruin'd, and reduc'd to misery and great want; she therefore humbly besought his Majesty, if he would be pleas'd to do nothing else for her, that he would order her the payment of her Husband's Arrears, &c. To which Petition, my Lord, this Court Reply'd, That Mr. Coleman, her Husband, had had more Mony from them than he de∣serv'd; That he had been a false, inconstant
Rascal, and had brought himself to that shameful end by his own Folly and Knavery, having had the impudence to threaten his Majesties Embassador, to turn Cat in Pan, &c. That his Majesty had nothing to say to her, and would not give her one Farthing; which surly Answer so thunder-struck the Poor Woman, that she return'd over into England so enrag'd, and in such a dreadful Fit of Despair, that she miserably cut her own Throat, at her Lodging in London; which relation and Coppy, of the Petition I had delivered me by an English Priest, who was Coleman's Wife's Confessor, and which after I had Transcrib'd it, I delivered to the English E—to be sent to King Charles the Ild. that he might see how his Bro∣ther's Creatures served him; but how he represented it is beyond my know∣ledge to tell. I have been tedious and am affraid troublesome to your Lordship by a long Epistle, but the Curiosities whereof the various parts of it are Composed, will I hope be as powerful a lenitiue against any Dis∣pleasure I may have incurred from your Lord∣ship, as they have been incitatives for me to write it, who am, My Lord, Your most humble, and most obedi∣ent Servant. Paris, Apr. . 1683. N. St.
LETTER LXVIII. Of the Marquess de Louvois's being in England several times in King Charles the II. Reign, and about what Business. My Lord, IN my last to your Lordship, I have given some intimations concerning the Dukes being in France, and Closetted by the French King, and of Mr. Coleman's Negotiations, and imbroylments with this Court, together with his Wifes Calamitous life, and Tragical death, which I believe were wholly new to you; And I cannot think but that of the Marquess de Louvois, our great Minister of State here, his being again and again in Eng∣land and Closetted there with the King and Duke, must be equally strange and surpriz∣ing to you; but tho it be a secret, I verily believe, to all other persons on your side, except the two foremention'd persons; yet it is not so entirely such here, especially in our Office: that he has been wanting sometimes, and hardly any of his Family knew what was become of him, is most certain, and upon such occasions, it was sometimes given out, he was indispos'd in the Country; sometimes that he was sent into Handers, Alsatia, &c. whether he afterwards went actually with so much expedition, tho he rode in a tter, that his Journeys into land were never
perceiv'd: I find two several occasions wherein he was Closetted. 1. About a year before the breaking out of the second Dutch War, when he was sent particularly to help the King and his Brother to concert the Preparations for, and man∣ner of Carrying on that War. 2. To concert measures how to stave off the effects of the Popish Plot, by remitting of Mony to dissolve Parliaments, and by o∣ther methods, when they saw they were carrying things farther then the French In∣terest required to have them driven, but upon condition the two Brothers should not depart from their Interests for the future; To complot measures how to ensnare the Protestant Party, and especially the high Patriots in a Plot that should quite ex∣tinguish the Popish one, and give the Duke of York opportunity to cut off all those who stood in the way between him and the Crown, and between the Crown and absolute Power; All which Closettings have been very short as well as private, and perform∣ed with incredible diligence, and of which 'tis all I am able to inform your Lordship, and with which I conclude, remaining, My Lord, Your Lordships most humble Servant. Paris, May 16. 1683. N. St.
LETTER LXIX. Of that called the Presbyterian Plot. My Lord, I Was not a little transported with Joy to find your Lordship's Name was not in∣certed in the List I have seen of Persons taken up for the Plot; I have had the vani∣ty to flatter my self, that some things that I have Writ lately to your Honour concern∣ing Monsieur Louvois's Negotiations in Eng∣land, may inspire you with a more than or∣dinary Caution upon such an occasion, where∣in when it shall lye with your Lordship's conveniency to let me have a Line from you, I do not desire so much to be satisfied, as what Rules I am to observe for my future conduct, in respect to my Correspondence, since I have some reason to suspect your Hon∣our may be uneasy under the present Cir∣cumstance of things, and I have heard, ∣settled too; I have little to say at present how far the Ministers of this Court are en∣gaged in starting of this Conspiracy, what I have formerly Written concerning their Management of the several Factions in Eng∣land, may give your Lordship some view of their Designs; but what they generally say of it, is, That it was now seasonable to set up a Protestant one, as a fresh game; and since by their strong concurrence, when they
saw it time, they had enabl'd the King to stiffe the other Popish one; and thereby di∣verted the current of his Arms ready to fall upon them; it was necessary, having new Designs of Conquests in view (and what can it be, but Luxemburg block't up by them last year) to raise a new Disturbance in his Dominions, which could not be better effected now, than by starting a Plot of an∣other Stamp, which would not only inca∣pacitate the King to interpose, and put a stop to their career, but would also be an effectual means to make the holding of Par∣liaments impracticable at least for a time, and make him quite fast in a manner to their King's Purse-strings, towards which they had by the other Plot made such considerable Advances. I do presume your Lordship retains the same English Spirit you were ever Master of, and are as constant, notwith∣standing all the vicissitudes of State, which have happen'd in your time, which is the Reason I retain still my usual freedom, who am, My Lord, Your humble Servant. Paris, July 21. 1683. N. S.
LETTER LXX. Of the Model of Ships sent by King Charles II. to the French King, &c. My Lord, I Do presume it is a matter no longer doubted of, that our King is fallen in more than ever with the interests of this Court; the many Models and Draughts of Ships which he has sent over hither, and some whereof I have seen at the Mar∣quess de Louvois, is a convincing proof of it, tho they are somewhat desirous to give it another Term here, and say; His Britan∣nick Majesty is well known to be the only Prince in the World that understands Ship∣ping the best, and that only out of a lit∣tle Vanity, to shew his great Abilities in that way, he sent diverse Models, not only into France, but else where also; tho the real Cause, as I have heard it whis∣per'd, was his want of Jealousy, and with∣al to Coaks as much Mony out of them as he could; and in order to enhance the same, he sent also Artists over as well as Models, for which, by the Account I have seen, tho it seems to be somewhat imperfect, as to the particulars, he hath already receiv'd, at times, above 600000 Pounds Sterling, which is all the particu∣lars I could ever attain to in relation to
this matter, that I know is the most ungrate∣ful to your Lordship to understand per∣haps, of any thing that has at any time dropp'd from my Pen, and therefore I am glad 'tis thus contracted, as I am always of an opportunity to acknowledg how much I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble Servant. Paris, June 4. 1684. N. S. LETTER LXXI. The Conduct of the Court of France to∣wards the Duke of York, during his aboad in Flanders and Scotland, &c. My Lord, YOUR Lordship will hardly believe the Treachery of the Ministers of this Court, who since I have known them, would stick at no manner of Villany to gain their ends; and our unhappy Princes have from time to time given them but too much opportunity to work their designs through their own sides; and this I have already made to appear by several instan∣ces to your Lordship, and shall further now by observing that notwithstanding his Royal Highnesses Compliance with
them in the business of Marrying his Daughter, so far as he could, and upon diverse other occasions, as I have formerly hinted: Yet at that time when he was forc'd to retire to Bruxels, they were very angry with him, and almost all the rest of the English Papists, hecause so many of them had seem'd Zealous to serve the Spanish interest, under the Duke in Flanders; nay, and the French King him∣self was heard to say, That had he follow∣ed his Counsel, and had been constant to him, he should not have needed to retire to Bruxels, or to any other place, but France, as I think I mention'd before to your Lord∣ship. Tho they seem'd afterward to mollify somewhat towards him; yet they set their Emissaries on work in England and Scot∣land, to deal with some persons, about whom they had formerly got some Light in Monsieur Ruvigni's time, to get the Duke sent into Scotland to make a Party there, while they privately engag'd the Dutchess of Portsmouth and the Exclusi∣oners in England, to do their utmost, both in Court and Parliament, to get him Ex∣cluded from the Succession, in hopes, and with this accursed view, that England having proceeded so far, as to put him by the Succession; Scotland would declare for him, and so the two Kingdoms be rent in sunder, and afflicted with a tedious War, wherein they had resolv'd to assist the
latter; and yet, my Lord, 'tis strange to think it, yet so it is that they were not true to him even there; for they got it privately propos'd to a certain Noble Fami∣ly in the Kingdom of Scotland, deriv'd from Blood Royal, that if they would put in a claim to the Scotch Crown, and throw off the Title of the two Brothers, upon preten∣sions to be suggested to them, and that Scotland would set up again for a King∣dom under a King of its own, and renew their Antient League with France, they should be Assisted effectually; and should besides have the Lands of the Dutchy of Chateleraut, and the Honours and Lands of Aubny, &c. with many other additions restor'd to them, and over and above all this, a large Annual Pension, and all the old Priviledges granted formerly to the Sootch Nation renewed and considerably augmented; but tho, my Lord, that No∣ble Family refus'd to hearken to these their Treacherous Invitations, yet there cannot a greater instance scarce be given of their Villanous Designs than this, which I could not but communicate to your Lord∣ship upon this occasion, who am, My Lord, Your Humble Servant.

LETTER LXXII. Of King Charles II's. Resolution a little before his Death, to alter his me∣thod ef Government. My Lord, I Am very well satisfied your Lordship must know in a very great measure, the present Resolutions of the King, in respect to his Future Government, when you know so well by whose Agency he was at first Undeceiv'd, and by whose Coun∣cil and Assistance he intends to proceed; but the Ministers here have too many Agents still about him to remain long Ig∣norant of the Design, and are not a little Allarm'd to understand, his Majesty hath resolv'd to restore all Charters, to call a Parliament, and thereby to get a mo∣derate Liberty settled on Dissenters, and to have the Boundaries of Prerogative, Parliamentary Priviledges, and Popular Liberty so clearly settled and explain'd, that there may arise no more Disputes a∣bout them between King and People for the Future; and that it shall be made Trea∣son after that, even in Parliament, once to move any thing prejudicial to the
King's declar'd and explain'd Prerogatives, or to the Parliament and Peoples declar'd Priviledges and Liberties; and that all Of∣ficers Military and Civil, shall be equally Sworn to maintain the one as well as the other; that the Duke, for the present, shall be Sollicited to go for Scotland, at∣tended with such Persons as would take care to observe his Steps narrowly; and that in his Absence the Princess Mary be Declar'd Heir Presumptive to the Crown, and the Prince invited to Reside with her in England till the King's Death, and the Duke totally Excluded, and confin'd to live at Modena or Rome, and not in this Kingdom, or elsewhere; but to have all his Revenues allow'd him; and that if he prove Refractory, and refuse to Retire any where else, but into France, that then he shall not only be depriv'd of his Reve∣nue, but be altogether confin'd in some Castle in England under a good Guard, &c. I do not question, my Lord, but this matter is sufficiently aggravated by the French Emis∣saries, and perhaps there may be something more in it, than I am able to fathom; however it was my Duty to Transmit the same as I find in represented, tho your Lord∣ship may know much more truly the Fact, than, My Lord, Your humble Servant Paris Jan. 4. 1685.

LETTER LXXIII. Of King Charles II's. Death. My Lord, YOur Lordship may expect I should acquaint you how much surpriz'd I was at the News of the King's Death; but the manner it was receiv'd here quite drown'd my Astonishment in that Kind, and so it would any true English Man, to see this Court have the News of his Ma∣jesties Death, or at least pretend to have it, and give Orders for Mourning, before our English Envoy had any such Notice given; so that when he came, according to Custom, to give them intimation of it, all the Court was seen in Mourning before Night, and all persons of Note in this City the next day; I'll leave your Lord∣ship to Reflect upon the Transactions and Circumstances of it, which tho compre∣hended in a few words, may afford a larger Field for Thought, than any thing my mind can at present suggest unto me, or my Intelligence reach unto, but it puts me in mind of somewhat (I think) I have writ in my last to your Lordship, and so I suppose it may do your Honour, if it has not already, but I am, My Lord, Your humble Servant Paris Feb. 22. 1635.

LETTER I. Of King James (when Duke of York) his pervertion to the Popish Religion, how and when it was done, &c. My Lord, YOUR Lordship cannot imagine how over-joy'd both Court and Country are here, upon the News of the King's go∣ing Publickly to the Roman Catholick Chap∣pel, upon His Assumption of the Crown; and many and various Discourses it has oc∣casion'd concerning His first Imbracing the Roman Faith; an Account whereof may not perhaps be unpleasing to your Lordship: And therefore I shall endeavour to grati∣fie your Honour therein, to the utmost of my power; some have been of opinion, that the Zeal, Example, and Exhortations of the Queen His Mother, to whom He seemed always to pay the greatest Deference, had wrought this Change early in him; and that the long Conversation he had had with those of the Roman Communion in France, Flanders and other places, had fortify'd him in the same Sentiments he had before im∣bib'd, and which at last appear'd in an open Profession; but, however this has a very great appearance of truth, its utterly de∣ny'd here, and averred with great Elogi∣um's
upon him, that it happened to him as it did to one of the Ancients, as Recorded in Holy Writ, that he should find in the Gall of a Monster, that was about to de∣vour him, that, wherewith to cure him of his Blindness. For, that it was in Reading of the History of the Reformation, written by a Protestant Author, that he came to see the Error wherein his Birth had engag'd him; that when he was oblig'd, when in Exile, to leave the Kingdom of France, and to retire to Bruxels, and having leasure enough to Read, he lighted there upon the History of the Reformation, written by Dr. Heylin, which he Read with much Attenti∣on; and notwithstanding the many strained pretences (say they) which the Protestants made use of to colour the Schism of their Country, he clearly saw that their Separati∣on, so plainly contrary to the Maxim of Unity, which is the Foundation of the Church, was nothing else but a meer ef∣fect of Humane Passions; that it was the Dissolute Life, and Incontinency of King Henry the Eighth, the Ambition of the Duke of Sommerset, the Pollicy of Queen Eliza∣beth, the Avarice of those that were gree∣dy to seize upon the Revenues of the Church, had been the Principal Causes of that Change, wherein the Spirit of God had no concern; that upon reflecting with himself. That God of old made use of Prophets of a most Holy Life, to be the
Guides of his People, and to Intimate his will unto them, in respect to Re∣ligion; that upon the change of the Divine Dispensation, the Apostles Inspi∣red with Heavenly Vertue, and more like to Disimbodyed Angels, than Carnal Men, Preached the Gospel; and that upon Disor∣ders, and Irregularities, both under the one, and the other Testament, They were not carnal persons, Vindictive Souls, Ambitious Spirits, that had Preached Re∣formation; but Men full of Moses's Spirit, or of Christ's, the only Channels worthy to receive the Waters which run from his Living Sources; so as that there might be no room left to render them suspected of Corruption or Falsity: he from thence∣forward became a Roman Catholick in his heart; That he had acquainted the King his Brother with it soon after the Resto∣ration, who highly Applauded him; but en∣gaged him to put that restraint upon him∣self, as to keep it secret: But, that some years after, having, by his Conduct, gi∣ven occasion to others to observe his Steps more warily, and finding he was not Cor∣dial to the Protestant Religion and Interest; they say here, the Arch-bishop of Canterbury and two of his Brethren Remonstrated the same to him; that he heard them with much Patience, and did not decline to Confer with them; but that their Confe∣rences and Arguments, were so far from
Staggering and Seducing of him, that they Confirmed him the more in the Faith: And they say farther, That tho' it was given out in England, That the late Dutchess of York's Complaisance to the Duke her Husband had wrought her Con∣version to the Romish Church, in the Communion of which she dy'd: yet it was notoriously false; for that she was brought over by a very remarkable event, next to a Miracle, by Reading the same Book that had Converted the Duke: But I shall trouble your Lordship no more with a Matter, which, I am sure, you cannot think of without trouble of Mind, and so I remain, My Lord, Your Honours to serve and Com∣mand. Paris, March 2. 1685. N. S. LETTER II. Of the Duke of Monmouth's being in Holland; and King James's Design to seize him there Miscarryed. My Lord, THE Misfortunes of the Duke of Mon∣mouth in the King his Father's time are beter known to your Lordship, then
I can pretend to inform you; and that when he was forced to quit England for his own safety, and that it came to be known he was retir'd into Holland, the Duke and French Emissaries never left Importuning the King to send to the States and Prince of Orange, to drive him from thence; al∣leadging continually, that there were very great Honours done him by the States, and especially by the Prince of Orange, who had given his Troops Orders to Salute him at their Reviews, when-ever he came to see them, designing thereby to make that Republick, and especially the Prince of Orange, more and more obnoxious to the King: so that he gave at last Orders to His Embassador, Mr. Chudley, at the Hague, to forbid the English Troops in that Service to shew the Duke any Respects; Having gain'd this Point, and that they might embroyl the King and Prince of Orange the more, Chudley was Instructed, to make the Officers of the said Regiments acquainted with the afore-mention'd Or∣ders, without first giving the Prince no∣tice thereof, under whose Command they were, which they knew well enough the Prince could not but Resent, as he did ac∣cordingly, Threatning Chudley for Inter∣fereing with his Authority without his leave; and this, upon the Embassador's Complaint to the King his Master, and
which was sufficiently Improved and Ag∣gravated by the Duke and French Agents about him, incensed him so against the Prince; that he dispatch'd Letters to Chud∣ley, forbidding him to see the Prince: and thus Matters stood when the late King died; but the Brother succeeding, he set all his Engines on work, how he might get the Duke of Monmouth into his Clutches Dead or Alive: But the French Agents, my Lord, did not think that now their Interest, which, in the late Reign, they would have given any Money to have effected; and therefore by their Correspondents in Holland, they got the Duke secretly Advertised of the Danger, who thereupon withdrew to Bruxels; I know, my Lord, they gave it out that the Prince of Orange, by his Favourite Monsieur Ben∣tink, got the Duke made acquainted there∣with, and that he gave him Money to go to Bruxels (it was both Honourably and Cha∣ritably done of him, if it was so, to a distres∣sed Gentlemen) with an intent to make the King, his Father-in-law, more irre∣concileable to him, now he was King, then when Duke of York; tho' he was to dissem∣ble it for a time; and, upon his Accession to the Throne, to testifie to the Prince, the sincere desire he had to live with him, ra∣ther as a Father, then an Ally and Neigh∣bouring King. I have had sufficient Expe∣rience, my Lord, of your great Honour, In∣tegrity,
and good Affection, which makes me thus bold in a matter so nice at this time, and so concludes, My Lord, Your humble Servant. Paris, March 17. 1685. N. St. LETTER III. Of King James's being Crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury. My Lord, IT has been a matter of much discourse and reflection here, that our King should be Crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and not by one of the Roman Communion; it was expected, that since he had begun so briskly and openly to de∣clare Himself for Rome, that he would not have stuck at being Inaugurated by a Roman Bishop; I find by the return made hither upon this Subject, that his inclinati∣ons were violent enough for the latter, but that the Reason of his Non-compliance was, that having at his assumption of the Crown, declar'd to the Council, and by them, to his People, That he would main∣tain the Church and State of England, as by Law Establish'd; and that the Ceremony
of his Coronation was such as the Laws of the Land did prescribe; The thought it was a little two Early to begin, and that by so pu∣blick an Act, which, to be sure, would be in∣terpreted not only as the most manifest Vio∣lation of the National Constitution, but the Preludium to a despotick Power, which no man knew the end of. I shall not trouble your Lordship with a Repetition of the Ar∣guments used here by the Gentlemen of the Roman Church, pro and con, upon the Law∣fulness and Unlawfulness of such a Compli∣ance by a Catholick King to the Church of England, which tho the Establish'd one, they look upon to be false to the Truth, as being matters which I suppose your Lord∣ship cares not for, and therefore having no∣thing further wherewith to entertain you that is worth Transmitting, I conclude, subscribing my self, My Lord, Your Honours most hum∣ble Servant. Paris May 6. 1685. N. S.
LETTER IV. Of the Duke of Monmouth and the Earl of Argyle's Invasions and Over∣throws, and of the Prince of Orange's offering to serve against the former, but his offer was Malitiously Interpre∣ted, and so Rejected. My Lord, THE Reason of my long silence to your Lordship, I hope, will not be interpreted by you, as any forgetfulness, much less neglect of your Honours Com∣mands and Expectation; I am too sensible of the many Obligations that have been heap'd upon me from time to time, to be guilty of so Notorious a Crime; but the want of somewhat that was Solid and Grateful to your Lordship, has been one genuine. Cause that obstructed my Corres∣pondence, to which I may add what your self knows very well, the private Orders given in England to open all Letters, whe∣ther Domestick or Foreign; and since I had for so long a time continu'd to write to your Lordship, and that undiscover'd, I was not willing for want of a little pru∣dent
caution, and suspension in such a jun∣cture, either to expose your Lordship to any hazard, or thereby for ever to exclude my self from any farther Correspondence with you, whom I so much Love and Honour; But now, my Lord, understanding that the Storm is over in England, by the defeat and death of the Duke, as we have had some days ago an Account from Scotland of the like misfortune to have attended the Earl of Argyle. I have adventured to Salute you with these Lines, and to tell my thoughts freely upon the matter. I must confess, I never had any great opinion of either of the Expeditions, because concert∣ed by Men who had very different ends in what they did; the Duke and some others for Monarchy, but the greatest part Re∣publicans; and therefore I do not wonder the whole hath miscarried, especially when I can assure your Lordship, both the one and the other were (tho' very privately) Abetted by French Agents, to undertake such an Expedition: such a procedure may well be wondred at, I confess, since there was apparently so little advantage like to arise to the French Court therefrom; but besides their loving to fish always in Troubled Waters, they have somewhat in them that is very like the Devil, who loves to do Mischief, tho' with no benefit to him∣self. But whatever the World may think hereof, those who are fled, that escaped
from either Kingdom, after the Defeat, are as kindly received here, as those who for∣merly fled from the Popish Conspiracy; but yet they are daily sifted and examin'd by the Spies that continually haunt them. I would gladly know? might I have the ho∣nour, your Lordship's Sentiments of both Descents, and the Miscarriage of them: to be plain with you, I own I have very diffe∣rent apprehensions of them, now they are over, than I had at first; and the rather, because the Prince of Orange so much re∣sented it; tho' most Maliciously interpre∣ted by the King, and his Popish Council, whetted on by Gallican Agents. When the Prince had the first News of the Duke's Landing in England, he acquainted Mr. Skel∣ton the King's Ambassador, that the Duke of Monmouth, though he were a Person but of indifferent Parts, yet he had a Warlike Genius, and had more Experience and Skill in the Art of War, then most of them em∣ploy'd against him; That for his part, if the King his Father-in-Law pleased, he would assist him, not onely upon that occa∣sion, with his Troops, but with his Per∣son also; and to that end was sending Mr. Bentinck over to England, to know the King's pleasure. But Skelton malevolent enough of himself, and farther influenc'd with Ma∣lice against the Prince by French Incendia∣ries, took care to inform the King before Bentinck came, that such Assistance as was
proposed by the Prince, was very dange∣rous, and much to the same purpose; so that upon Mr. Bentinck's Motion, the King answered, That their Common Interest re∣quired, that the Prince should stay in Hol∣land; and gave such further expressions of his Mind upon that occasion, that plainly discover'd, that such a Zeal in the Prince was esteem'd unseasonable, and not free from Suspition. With which, and a grate∣ful acknowledgment of all your Lordship's Favours to me, and my Family, upon all oc∣casions, I shall now conclude, and for ever remain, My Lord, Your Lordship's Most humble Servant. Paris, August 24. 1685. N. S. LETTER V. Of the Methods proposed, and Arguments used to King James, for carrying on the Dispensing power. My Lord, THAT the King intends to Assume a Power into His Hands of Dispen∣sing with Penal Laws against Recusants, I believe your Lordship may be sensible of by this time, since it's manifest, that not∣withstanding
the Parliaments Remon∣strance to the contrary, he retains the Popish Officers still in his Service; and that it is so far from being a Secret here, that I can oblige your Lordship with some of those Methods and Arguments suggest∣ed to him, by the Agency of this Court, to carry it onward, wherein it's more then whis∣per'd here, he has fully acquiesced. It was thought advisable, considering the violent Humour of the Nation against the admissi∣on of such Persons, either into Military or Civil Offices, and that all the Cry was, That the King had not kept his Word, but did thereby Infringe their Laws and Li∣berties, to bring the matter into Westmin∣ster-Hall, to have the Dispensing Power there Argued upon a particular Case; but, to make sure of the Judges before-hand, to Favour such a Procedure; the King was told, could he gain such a Point, his bu∣siness were done for ever; tho', at the same time, it was his undoubted Preroga∣tive to dispense with Laws, being an Essen∣tial right, and an usage in England as anci∣ent as the Kingdom; that it was in being at all times, and in all Reigns, that there were several Acts, wherein there had been Provision made for such a Reservation to the King; that the Term of Nonobstante, which was so common, was always a Dis∣pensing with some Law; that the Commu∣tation of Punishments are no less a proof
thereof; And how much more were Remissions, Pardons, the Restoration of Criminals to their Goods again, &c? That there were Presidents to be met with, wherein the King's of England had suspended the Effects of Laws, not only by Dispensations, regarding particular and sin∣gle persons, but by a general Suspension, in regard to the whole Kingdom: That his Brother had done so in cases of the Statute relating to Carriages, whereof there was not the least complaint in Par∣liament: neither was it so much as once said, that he had thereby exceeded the Just bounds of His Authority: That the same had been done by Henry the Seventh, his Great Ancestor, and Solomon of En∣gland, in respect to the Act that prohibit∣ed the Continuation of Sheriffs in their Of∣fice above One Year, which, in Council, was declared null, and impracticable; be∣cause that thereby the King was divested of of his Regal Power in disposing his Subjects. I do not question, my Lord, but you will soon hear of the effects of such Council, but whether to your satisfaction therein, I have as great reason to doubt, as I have a desire to promote it, and ever shall, to the best of my power, who am My Lord, your very humble servant. Paris, Nov. 13. 1685. N. S.
LETTER VI. Of the Unjust Complaints of the French Clergy, against the Reformed in France. My Lord, THE Ruin of the Reformed in this Kingdom is as much precipitated, as that of a Protestant Church is designed some∣where else, and which I believe your Lord∣ship, by this time, is pretty well per∣swaded of; and to this end the Popish Cler∣gy have accosted the King with a severe Remonstrance against them, the sum where∣of, for want of more entertaining News, I shall write to your Lordship at this time: They began with the hardiest Lie they could have invented, saying, That there was nothing included in their Complaint, but what was most necessary, and could be most clearly jnstified and made good. Whereas it is most evident, that every ti∣tle of it tends to Destroy and Persecute, and is grounded upon the most manifest Falsities in the World: then they begin to charge the Reformed with Calumniating, and falsly Accuting the Catholicks, that they did not believe the Truths of the Faith, as they express it; whereas the Protestant Divines here, have so far been complyant, as to testifie from time to time, that the
Roman Church retained still those Truths that were Essential to Christianity, In that she makes Profession to Believe in one God in three; the Incarnation of the Son of God; the Redemption of Sinners by the Price of his Blood; and divers other Arti∣cles contained in the Antient Creeds; then they proceeded, saying, That the design of the Pastoral Advertisement in 1681, was to oblige the Reformed to acknowledge, that their Separation was not grounded but up∣on Suppositions and Jealousies, and they hugged themselves, that the many Conversi∣ons which had been wrought since that time, have been almost all procured by this consi∣deration; which they call an Invincible Ar∣gument, that as there could never have been any Just Cause of Separation, all those alleadged by the pretended Reformed, could never have any sollidity; That the Protestant Ministers did their utmost to hinder the People to profit by that same Advertisement, either by deterring of them from Reading of the same, or else by giving false Explications thereof, as they were wont to do of the Holy Scriptures, and Works of the Fathers: Adding farther, That the Exercise of the Reformed Re∣ligion had been permitted by the King's Predecessors, provisionally only, and by rea∣sons which have no longer subsistance: that tho' the Clergy had very good Reasons to urge it so as to require a Revocation of the
Edicts which contained this permission, yet that it was not their present design to insist upon that Point: that it was now the only favour they pray'd for, for to re∣press the Calumnies of the Reformed against the Roman Church, which were not, and which could not be allowed by any Edict, being an unhappy Liberty, which the Mi∣nisters themselves might be ashamed of: that such a supposition and Calumny were Crimes Condemn'd by all Laws both Hu∣mane and Divine, and that the Reformed durst not maintain, that those excesses ought to be permitted, nor to make their Complaints, if the King should forbid them to commit them. Then they went to speak of the Method they had thought on, to make the King acquainted with the truth of their Com∣plaints: they drew up in Two Collumnes the Doctrine of the Church of Rome, and that, which they said, the Reformed imputed to them, to the end it might be easier for the King to compare them; and said most Ma∣lignantly, That they had avoided the Rela∣ting of many thing; which exceeded all the bounds of Modesty, and which St. Paul himself would not have as much as named amon the Faithful, to the end they might create a Suspicion, by these pretended Ca∣lumnies, of somewhat that was yet blacker then what had appear'd in the passages which they had recited. They protested,
that they would never have made any com∣plaint of the Reformed, had the matters in question referred only to the Persons of the Bishops; and that on the contrary, they would have been content to be depri∣ved of their Power, in order to testifie, by their Patience, and voluntary Forgetful∣ness of those Outrages that were done them, that singular Charity which they re∣tained for them; but that they could not neglect the Honour of the Church, attack'd by the Calumny of the Ministers, nor the Conversion and Salvation of a great num∣ber of her Children, which they retained in the Error of their false suppositions; wherefore they concluded after all, that the King would be pleased to repress a Malignity that was so contrary to the Prin∣ciples of Christianity, as also to the Rules of Natural Justice; and that consequently, 1. That he would renew the Prohibiti∣ons already made to the Reformed of using Injurious and Opprobrious Terms, in speak∣ing of the Articles and Mysteries of the Ro∣man Faith. 2. That he should forbid them to attri∣bute to the Catholick Faith any other Doctrine then that of its profession of Faith, nor any of those Errors which they had had till then, the rashness to impute unto her.
You need not doubt, my Lord, of the Success of this Remonstrance, and of a De∣claration in time, Answering all the Points hereof to the full. There is room enough for Reflecting upon the Courts Conduct herein, but I shall forbear that part, leaving it entire∣ly to your Lordship's known Wisdom and Judgment, and crave leave both now and al∣ways, to profess how much I am, and desire to approve my self to be, My Lord, Your Honours to Serve and Obey. Paris, Nov. 27. 1685. N. S. LETTER VII. Of the Declaration put out by the French King, upon the Remonstrance of the Popish Clergy, against the Reformed, the Month of August, 1685. My Lord, I Have in my last to your Lordship, of uly the 27th, N. S. taken notice of the Popish Clergy's Unjust complaint to the French King, against the Reformed here; and now I shall, with presuming on your
good Leave, give you some hints upon the Declaration that was Publish'd here some days ago in Conformity to the said Remon∣strance; to which the King condescended so far, that the Motives thereof are almost drawn word for word from the Request it self; All sorts of Persons are thereby strictly forbid to Preach and Write against the Faith, or the Doctrine of the Romish Church, and to lay to the Catholicks Charge those Opinions which they allow not of, and not so much as to speak directly, nor indirectly any manner of way whatsoever concerning the Catholick Religion; enjoyning the Reformed Ministers to Teach only in their Sermons the Tenets of their own Religion, and Rules of Morality, without the intermix∣ture of any other matter whatever: But alas, the Mischief did not stop here, for all persons are Prohibited to Print, Sell, or Lend any other Books concerning Religi∣on, besides such as contain the Profession of their Faith, their Prayers, and ordinary Rules of their Discipline: It doth more∣over Order the Suppression of all such Books as have been Written against the Catholick Religion, by those of the pretend∣ed Reformed Religion, and strictly forbids either to Print or Lend any such Books for the future; those Ministers and others of the Reformed, that make default herein, are liable to great Fines, perpetual Banish∣ment, and the Confiscation of all their
Goods, the Places where the Ministers should Preach against the Articles of the Edict, to lose the Right they had, to exercise the same function for ever; and the Prin∣ters and Booksellers in case of their Offend∣ing in any kind, to forfeit Five Hundred Livres, and for ever to lose the Freedom of keeping open Shops: And thus, My Lord, you see this Court has shut up the Mini∣sters Mouths in all matters of Controversy, and leave that Liberty only to the Roman Catholick Divines, thereby preparing of them for an assur'd Victory, and hereby, besides, That the Ministers, are reduced to be silent, and not to concern themselves, as to the greatest part of the Articles of the Confession of their Faith, which consists in the Rejection of the Tenets of the Church of Rome, as false and contrary to the Doct∣rine of the Gospel; that they might effectu∣ally preclude them from the Right they had to complain of this unjust dealing, the King, by way of addition, in the Preface to his Edict, to the Reasons which the Clergy's Petition had suggested to Him, has incerted, That it was enough for the Mini∣sters of a Religion, tolerated in the King∣dom, to teach their own Tenets, without being carried into Disputes against the Publick and Prevailing Religion, which also is therein call'd the True One: But one should think this Edict were as needless as many others, seeing there are not now past
twenty Reformed Churches in the Kingdom, where they have Liberty to Preach; but there seems to be an hidden Design couch'd under it, and it is justly to be fear'd, That after they have suppress'd the Reformation in all the Countries under the French Do∣minions, they have hereby made Provision, That the Doctrine of Truth shall not be maintained in private Families, and never have that means to rise up again out of its Ruins, by the Reading of such Books as Teach it; wherefore they have taken care to prepare Reasons for the Depriving the Reformed of Books of this Nature, and to Establish a kind of an Inquisition over their works, which shall not concede to any one the Liberty either to read them, or keep them by him. But of this, I shall be able to give a fuller Account in my Next, and shall therefore defer it, and so I remain, My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble Servant Paris Sep. 2. 1685. N. S.
LETTER VIII. Of the Suppression of Protestant Books in France. My Lord, I Have in the close of my last Letter to your Lordship, hinted somewhat con∣cerning the Suppression of Protestant Books in this Kingdom; I have since seen a Cata∣logue which contained almost Five Hundred Authors, whose Works are all Condemn'd. Some men in the World love to put the Cheat upon themselves, so they here, to heighten the Number of such Books, have repeated some of them more than once; but they have been also as careful to for∣get several others, as the Works of the Learned Grotius, Vossius, and many more, whose Writings are opposite to the Roman Church; but your Lordship, I believe, is no stranger to the ly Practise of that Church on this head, and how the Members of it have, of a long time, endeavour'd to perswade the World, That these Illustrious Persons had re-entred into their Party; That they were willing to retain an Honourable Re∣membrance of their Names, tho it be cer∣tain in the main, that the greatest part of
what they had Writ, was as remote from Truth, as the Authors were from the Com∣munion of their Church; That Grotius himself, who hath carried his Complaisance towards the Roman Church, much farther than any other, yet he never rang'd himself of her side by an open Profession, and did still retain diverse sentiments that were very contrary to the Court of Rome also; but that this Default might be Remedied by a Pious Fraud; and to the end, they may one day perswade the simple and ignorant that all the Heresies that have sprung up in these last Ages of the World, are as so many Tenets of the Calvinists; they have not only joyn'd the Lutheran and Armini∣an Books to them, but also those of the Socinians, and the Works of Spinosa; And they have not, my Lord, contented themselves to Condemn the Books which have been Written by the Reformed against the Church of Rome, but they have also hemm'd in Books that refer only to pure Morality, and which Astonishes many here: the Theses also of Josua de le Place, with∣out excepting those written by him against the Socinians, and is a Book that does not attack the Church of Rome in any one of her Tenets, and is only design'd for to prove the Divinity of our Saviour, against the Sophistical Arguments of that Sect; the Translation also of the History of the Council of Trent, which Amelot de la Hous∣say,
a Roman Catholick Author has put forth, is comprehended in the Catalogue of Heretical Books; I cannot be positive to affirm to your Lordship who had the chief hand in forming this Catalogue; it's gene∣rally attributed to the Arch-bishop of this City; but they tell us further, That because he would have appear'd to have acted too much like a Patriarch in obliging the rest of the Bishops to take this Rule of their Con∣duct from him, he has by the intreagues of the Procurator General, brought his mat∣ters so to bear, that the Parliament here have committed it to his care to make an Esti∣mate of those Books which ought to be sup∣press'd; the Order was no sooner Published, but the King's Officers, and the Civil Ma∣gistrates who were commanded to have the same put in execution, have accordingly made a search for those Books in all Book∣sellers Shops, and also in the Elders and Mi∣nisters Houses. The Arch-bishop, my Lord, has some Years ago made use of a very Efficacious Method for to hinder the Publication of any Book that deserv'd to come into the World; I believe, your Lordship, may have seen the Historical and Chronological Tables of John Rou, who was a Person of great Learning, and whose Merit had acquir'd unto him the Favour and Protection of several Persons of the Highest Quality in the Kingdom of France; and which Tables he presented to
the Duke of Monthauzier; there is but a very slight mention in the Book, and that but by the by, of any of the Principles of the Church of Rome, and those also which she Esteems, and looks not upon to be of the highest consideration and impor∣tance; but these slight touches, and the Honour which the Author had done to some Ministers of the Reformed to Name them, among the illustrious Doctors of their Age, raised the Indignation of all the Bigots in the Church against him, and so they got his Copies and Tables, which to his great cost and Expence he had got En∣graven, Seiz'd; and the poor Gentleman could not find an Ear open to the offers he made to Correct and Amend those places which might give Offence; and all the Soli∣citations and Friends he could make, could never prevail so far as to get Justice done him; there are some Persons now who would Redeem them for their own proper use; but tho it be nine or ten years ago since the forementioned Transaction, they have not yet forgot the Noise it then made, and they will by no means part with them; who knows but the Crafty Jesuits have a mind to reserve them, to procure Honour to themselves by them, when they think the ingenious Person that contrived them may be no more Remember'd; for it must without Vanity be own'd, that they are compos'd with so much Art, Judgment,
Order and solid Learning, that there is no man but may glory to be esteem'd the Author of them. This Search, my Lord, after the sup∣pressed Books, has been already made in se∣veral places, and not only some other Bi∣shops, who have no manner of dependance upon the Archbishop of this City; but other Parliaments, we hear, have receiv'd the Catalogue, and put the Order of the Parliament here in Execution; There are several of the Protestant Churches, which have very considerable Libraries; but some of them already are Rifled under this pre∣tence by the Romanists; and 'tis not to be so much doubted as 'tis to be fear'd, the rest will soon run the same hard Fate; This Search has also reach'd the Houses of several particular Persons; whom they have been so severe upon, that they have not so much as left them their Bibles, because the Catalogue has put the Versions of the Bible made by Hereticks, among the Number of Prohibited Books; but surely these Translations, how faulty soever they may suppose them to be, cannot justly be put among the Number of those Books, wherein the Church of Rome was accus'd of holding Opinions which are not receiv'd by her, nor consequently be comprehended a∣mong those whom the Edict ordered the Suppression of: As for the Ministers they are us'd very variously, the greatest part have
not yet been molested upon the Account of their Books, for perhaps, as they have al∣ready contriv'd to be rid of them by Ba∣nishing them out of the Kingdom; they look upon it as a kind of Suppression of the Condemn'd Books, to suffer them to carry them away along with them; but I am as∣sur'd they have given others of them much molestation in diverse parts of the King∣dom; some of whose Books they have Seiz'd, some Confiscated, and caus'd others to be Burnt; nay, they have been so outragious against many of them, as to disposess them of all their Manuscripts and Sermons; I am sorry, I am forc'd to give your Lordship this Relation of the Misery of the distressed Protestants of this Kingdom, because I know it will Trouble you, and inspire you with a Noble, tho grievous Sympathising of their condition; but I am afraid the worst is yet to come; I pray God to divert it to whom I commend you and yours, and am My Lord, Your Honours most Humble and Obedi∣ent Servant. Paris, Sep. 12. 1685. N. S.
LETTER IX. Of the Popes Nuncio opposing any New Form of Doctrine design'd to be intro∣duc'd by the General Assembly at Paris, for the easier seduction of the Reformed to comply with the Popish Church, and be United to her. My Lord, THIS Court is so taken up with Form∣ing Methods and Projects to bring the Reformed to a Complyance and Con∣formity to the Roman Church, that I do not find they mind any Forrein Affair at pre∣sent: I have seen several Formula's con∣ceiv'd in very easie Terms, for the promo∣ting of the Re-union, as 'tis call'd by them; but, among others, this that follows, I thought very remarkable, and whereby your Lordship may see the Latitude they assume to themselves, for the promoting their In∣terest, tho', no doubt, it is but a Bait to catch some of those harmless Gudgeons; the words were these, I own and confess the Catholick Apostolick and Roman Church, as it was in the time of the A∣postles; and I Renounce and Abjure all those Errors which have crept in ever since. The Bishop of Meux hath, to
make the way still smoother, in his Pre∣face to the Second Edition of his Expostulati∣on of the Catholick Doctrine, gone so far, as to say, We do not serve Images, God for∣bid we should do so. And indeed, there is some likelihood that the Clergy would have stretch'd their Complaisance yet far∣ther this way, had not an unexpected acci∣dent hindred it; for, the Pope's Nuncio being inform'd, that the General Assem∣bly, or rather the Arch-bishop of this Ci∣ty, under the Covert of that Name, and by the Advice of the Jesuits, were about to draw up, and form a Profession of Faith, more adapted for the satisfaction of such of the Reformed, as became New Converts, than that of the Roman Church, he bestirr'd him∣self, and interposed, in his Master, the Pope's Name, and made several Remonstrances to the King, upon the Authority which the French Clergy were about to assume to themselves, of setting up other Forms of Doctrine, then that which the whole Ca∣tholick Apostolick Church had received since the Council of Trent: You cannot imagine, my Lord, how much this little unexpected Traverse from the old Dad disheartn'd the Court; whether it were that it came from a Pope, whom the King did not care for, or that they were afraid it might retard the Work of Conversion, is not certain; but the result was (as I have been first informed, and since seen
somewhat verify'd by the consequence) that the Pope should be comply'd with, and the rather because they were well satis∣fy'd with his inflexible temper; and that as they believ'd, it would be dangerous to sow Division between the Clergy of France and the Pope, at a time when they were labouring to reduce all Frenchmen to the Unity of the Church; it would be more advisable for them, to keep to the usual Profession of Faith: And now, my Lord, the Clergy give out, every where, that they will not qualify any Points, but vaunt, that in reducing the Reformed, they will not put out any one Taper that Adorns the Altars. I shall not detain your Lordship at present with any farther ac∣count of a matter, that suits not with your Gusto, tho' I know you have goodness e∣nough to accept my endeavours, though ne∣ver so contemptible in themselves, and to pardon my weakness, who am, My Lord, Your Lordships very obedient servant. Paris, Sept. 17. 1685.
LETTER X. Of Popish Guardians imposed upon Pro∣testant Children, and of Protestant Physitians, Chyrurgeons, and Apo∣thecaries being forbidden to follow their Practise, with the pretended Reasons alleadged for such a Prohibition. My Lord, WHatever underhand-brewing may be in England, in matters of Religion; they be bare-fac'd enough re in carrying on their Designs for the Ruine of the Re∣formed Churches, tho' still they retain some specious pretences for what they do; 'tis but lately that we have had a Declaration publish'd, forbidding any to take upon them the Office of Guardians to Children, whose Parents have died in the Protestant Religion, excepting such as are Roman Ca∣tholicks; and tho' that part of the Edict that concedes this Privilege to the Refor∣med, is couch'd in the most clear and ex∣press terms that could be conceiv'd; yet the Declaration takes no manner of notice of the said Article; nay, and the Expressi∣ons wherein it has been conceiv'd, are such as would bespeak, that such an usage has
been without foundation; but indeed, this is a method that the French Council has for some time used, when they have been mind∣ful to put out any Order in prejudice to any of the Privileges granted in the Edict that are exprest so clearly, as that no Cavils raised by them can render them dark and and absurd: And, as they found it too difficult a Task to find Reasons forcible e∣nough to elude such formal Concessions, they made a shew of being ignorant of them, and they were willing to put forth such Orders that might only seem to Regu∣late such New and Extraordinary Cases. But yet that they might have some coloura∣ble pretences for what they did herein, they charged the Guardians of the Refor∣med Religion with Two Crimes; First, That they abus'd that Power which they had in that quality over those in Pupillage to them, and hindred them to become Catholicks; Then that they Imbezell'd the Estates of such Minors, when they became Converts against their Will, which was a great Obsta∣cle to their Preferment when they came of Age: These two things were spoken of, as if there had been nothing in the World more certain and truer, and of which they had had abundant experience; but they are of the number of such instances, that are alike easie to be raised, as impossible by any proofs to maintain; and, any ones Rea∣son, my Lord, will give him, especially as
to the last Article, that it must be notori∣ously false; For can any one believe, that such Guardians, who would adventure in a malicious way, to imbezill the Estate of their Pupils, could go unpunish'd, in a Countrey, where their Religion and Power was so much in the Wain; and surely he must be next to a Madman that would thus adventure to play with the Zeal of the Par∣liaments of this Kingdom, animated by the Recommendation of the Clergy, who are forward enough to make their Court into them. And if, my Lord, the Protestant Guar∣dians are thus Injuriously used, the Physici∣ans of the same Perswasion have fared much worse, as being deprived by another Decla∣ration, of their Means of Living upon the most ridiculous pretences in the World; they alleadging, that since those of the Refor∣med Religion were already deprived of all Judicial Affairs, and the freedom to exer∣cise the Functions of Counsellors at Law, it were to be feared the greatest part of their young Men might fall to the Study of Physick; That, that would considerably augment the number of Protestant Physici∣ans, and that those of the Roman Catholicks must by that means as much decrease, and that hereafter that would become very prejudicial to the Salvation of sick Catho∣licks, in that the Reformed would take no care to put their Patients in mind of Re∣ceiving
the Sacraments of the Church, when they found them reduc'd to such a condition, as did require them: I know not, my Lord, but that there may be a Snake in the Grass here, and that the Crafty Jesu∣its amuse the World with such Illusions, and would buoy People up in a belief, that since they have taken ch great Precautions for futurity, it's the least of their thoughts to come to an entire abolition of the Refor∣med's Privileges, and put Constraints upon their Consciences in Religious, matters; I wish it may prove so, the event will dis∣cover it. When this hardship was put upon the Physitians, the Chyrurgeons and Apothecaries every where began to look about them, and were terribly afraid their turns would be next: they had just reason for it, my Lord, for not many days were elaps'd since the Pub∣lication of the former, but comes out an Order of Council, Prohibiting all Chyrur∣geons and Apothecaries who made Profession of the Reformed Religion, to exercise their Art, neither by themselves, nor by the Inter∣posure of other Persons, directly or indi∣rectly, nor consign their Privileges to a∣nother, nor by any other way or means what∣soever: insinuating, that the exercise of such Trades gave them easie admission into Mens Houses, and by that means hindred the Conversion of other Religionaries. And thus, my Lord, the Art of Physick,
and those others dependant thereon, are looked upon as the last Resourses of the Reformed Religion here; and this has Ad∣ministred occasion to some Persons to shew their Wit, and to divert themselves with such Frigid Pleasantries, saying, That the Reformed Religion was at the Point of Death: that the Chyrurgeons and Apothe∣caries could do no more for her; and that there was no doubt to be made, but that she should in time be abandoned by the Physitians also. Your Lordship having exprest no Dissatisfaction with my keeping up my Correspondence with you in things of this kind, for want of more agreeable Matter for your Information, has enbol∣den'd me to accost you again in this man∣ner, and gives me farther Incouragement to be assiduous to get the most certain In∣telligence I can, as well as fresh opportu∣nities to profess how much I am desi∣rous, My Lord, to serve you whilst. Paris, Sept. 20. 1685.
LETTER XI. Of Iealousies raised in the Reformed in France, that there was a design form'd to Massacre them. My Lord, THings are now carried on in this Kingdom, with so high an hand against the Reformed Churches, as to threa∣ten an entire Destruction of them in a very short time; It has been a matter de∣bated and hesitated upon for a long time, whether they should send their Dragoons amongst them, and make use of that Expedi∣ent, since their Lives and Popish Arguments fail'd them to reduce them to Re-unite with the Romish Church; They were not with∣out their fears, least when they should send Armed Men in that manner, and to that end, to those parts of the Country wherein the Protestants were in greatest Numbers, and to many Rich and Populous Cities, where almost all the Inhabitants are of that Perswasion, they might meet with, some unexpected Resistance, which might con∣strain them to Abandon their Enterprise, or come to a down right Massacre. There is indeed a Rumor whisper'd up and down
That there has been secret Applications made to the King, That considering the Resistance which the Reformed might make to his Orders, and the little success which his Designs had already, and was like to meet with, in preventing their Retreat out of the Kingdom; That it were a much surer, more expeditious and better way for him to be rid of them by a Massacre; Nay, my Lord, it's confidently said, and I have some Moral Assurance of it, that the Orders were given, and the Let∣ters drawn already, when a Prince of the Blood coming to hear of such Barbarous Resolutions, had the Courage to Remon∣strate to the King the Evil, as well as the Dishonour of it, and goodness enough not to leave importuning of him till the Orders were Revok'd, and the Let∣ters supprest. I cannot be so positive as I would in giving his Name to your Lordship; some saying it was the Re∣nowned Prince of Conde, but others at∣tribute it to his Nephew the Prince of Conti, both of them Persons of great Honour always, and as likely either of them to concern themselves in that behalf, as any in the Kingdom; but whatever stop may have been put to the Jesuitical Fury here∣by; I think they have begun to discharge it by their Dragoons, almost in as Barbarous a manner, who have been already guilty of a Thousand Violences, and the Almigh∣ty
alone knows where it will Terminate I beg your Lordship's Pardon, if I am any ways troublesome by such Relations, and beg leave to subscribe my self, My Lord, Your Lordships most Obedient Servant. Paris, Sep. 24, 1685, N. S. LETTER XII. Of the Violences offered to, and the Stra∣tagems used against the Reformed of Bearn. My Lord, THE Protestant Churches in the Pro∣vince of Bearn, had been several Years ago under some sham pretences or other, reduced to the Number of Five, and the Parliament from time to time, have endeavour'd to render them of no use by the Imprisonment and Silencing of their Ministers; but now there has been such a prank plaid for Converting some of the Inhabitants to the Popish Church, as I think hardly has ever been Practised by any other People in the known World: For the Intendant of the Province having
made use of a Notorious Fellow to carry on the Work, he deludes some of the People to go with him to a Tavern, and there by his Artifice found the way to make them Drunk. Next Day when they were come to themselves, he goes and tells them, That they had promised him they would go to Mass, and that if they pre∣tended to deny it, they would be sure to be Treated as Apostates; That they had besides spoken ill of the Govern∣ment, and the Ministers, of Religion; and that the only way for them to escape a severe Punishment, which they had made themselves lyable to, was to Conform to the Church of Rome: There was about Fifty of them that were catched with this simple Wile; whereof the Intendant Vaunted so much, that he has Writ to Court, that there is so General an incli∣nation in the whole Province to become Catholicks, That the King has no more than to Testify his desire they should do so, for him to see the whole Country Embrace the Roman Communion; And so having obtained such farther Orders as he desired, he has caused an Assembly of New Converts to meet together at Mus∣lac, and hath Ordered the Civil Magi∣strates of the Neighbouring Places to cause the Reformed of their respective Pa∣rishes to come thither, under pretence of hearing a Sermon, which the Bishop of
Lescar was to Preach there: Now the Bishop, my Lord, as is well known, is fitter for a Play-house than a Pulpit, and a Ser∣mon of his Preaching was look'd upon by all a thing so rare, as to excite the curiosity of the most stupid in the World to go and hear him; wherefore abundance of Persons from all parts presented them∣selves at the place appointed; But when they came there, they could hear no other Sermon than the Declaration of the In∣tendant, to acquaint them, That it was the King's Pleasure they should all turn Roman Catholicks; Those who refused to comply to this unexpected Command, were Cudgelled into the Church, had the Doors made fast upon them, and with the same Vio∣lence, were forc'd to keep silence, fall down upon their Knees, and to receive from the good Bishop an Absolution of their Heresy; and thereupon were told, That if they of∣fered for the future to go and hear their own Minister, they should be infallibly Punished for Apostates: such and a thou∣sand the like Violences they Practised of late in that Province; as I have a faithful Account thereof, too tedious to trouble your Lordship withal; but because your Lordship may perhaps have heard a mighty Noise of a Design to Besiege Fontarabie by the French: I shall in a very few words un∣fold that Mistery to you.
The Intendant, my Lord, having found that those, and the like sham-Tricks above mentioned, did not answer his his End, but that the generality of the People still stuck Tight to their Prin∣ciples; found there was a necessity to bring in Armed Men to constrain them to a Complyance. It was given out here, That this Court was highly dissa∣tisfied at that of Spain; that they durst appear sensible of the Outrages done them on Flanders side; and so for sa∣tisfaction, talked loud of nothing else than Besieging Fontaraby; saying at the same time, That France would do no∣thing but what was Just, and therefore they were not willing to begin a War on that side where the Barrier might be broken (which was made by the late Peace) between their Conquests, and the United Provinces; and in carrying their Arms towards the other side, could give them no manner of Umbrage. In Con∣formity to this seeming Design, the-Troops Defiled towards Bearn, but in stead of Advancing to Invest Fontara∣bie, they have halted there ever since, and committed all the Insolences that the most barbarous of Nations could e're be guilty of. But since I have entred upon the Relation of the Misery of this Fa∣mous
Province, I shall endeavour a lit∣tle further to trespass upon your Lord∣ships Patience, and shew what pretences the Clergy have raised to Justify the Ri∣gorous Prosecution of the Bernois, before others in the Kingdom; They have had the Artifice to Abolish the Remembrance of the Conspiracy which their Predeces∣sors had formed in this Principality against their Lawful Sovereigns, and have had the Audaciousness to perswade the King, that the Reformed Religion was never Esta∣blished in that Province, but by the Authority of Queen Jane, who would have her own Religion to be Uppermost; And that as she had then Banished the Catholick Religion out of her Dominions by Arms, in favour of that Doctrine whereon she her self Doted; the King who was the Eldest Son of the Church, might very justly do the same thing for the Exter∣minating of that Change in Religion there, which had been introduc'd by Violence; and thus you see, my Lord, the Popish Clergy here leave nothing unessay'd for the Advancement of their Designs, (I am afraid they are of the same Kid∣ney every where else) and they have got the knack (when there is occasion) of making that a Crime in their Enemies, which is but the just Punishment of their
own; for by disguising the Truth of Hi∣story, as they have done herein, they have made that to pass in Queen Jane for an Usurpation over the Liberties of her Subjects, and the freedom of their Consciences, which was but a Lawful Revenge she had taken on the Perfidious Clergy of her Dominion, who had form∣ed against her, and the Princes her Chil∣dren such a Conspiracy as can hardly be paralell'd, before the introduction of the Ignatian Order ino the World; however, right or wrong, they have gain'd their Point, and under this false relation of so memorable an Event, they have made it to pass for a con∣stant Truth; That under a Queen of the Reformed Religion, that Religion which she Authoriz'd, was introduced by force in Bearn, and that consequently there would be no room left to complain; that a Popish King in his Turn, made use of Force to repress it. This was the ground pretended for beginning to put Bearn under Military Execution; as if from what was formerly done for the just Punishment of a Rebellious People, there were a just consequence to be drawn for an unjust Oppression of the most Submissive and Obedient Subjects: But having already Trespassed by an over
tedious Letter, I shall not farther ag∣gravate it, but remain, My Lord, Your Lordships most Humble and Devoted Servant. Paris, Sep. 27. 1685. N. S. LETTER XIII. Of the Rejoycings in Pearn upon the Imaginary Success they had in Con∣versions. My Lord, IN my last to your Lordship, I remem∣ber I was somewhat tedious in my Narration of the Sufferings of the Poor Protestants in the Principality of Bearn. It were endless for me to recite the far∣ther Particulars that have come to my knowledg since; and therefore I shall wave it, and acquaint your Lordship, for want of a better Subject, how much the Clergy have Triumphed in the Suc∣cess they have imagined, those Violences they have been guilty of towards those
People, had to bring them over to their Communion. They have not fail'd to Testify as much Joy at it, as if there had been some Battle got, or some City tak∣en from the Enemy: But what was very Cruel and Terrible, was, That the poor Reformed were forc'd to take part in these Rejoycings, of which their own Ruin was the Subject. It would be too tedious to recount to your Lordship, the many Cruelties exercised in this Country, and particularly at Pau, as a Preludium to this Force; But after the Reduction of the foresaid place, they made a general Procession, whereunto they dragged the New Converts, and withal Celebrated High Mass, whereat the Parliament as∣sisted in a Body: And then when that was over, Te Deum was sung, the Guns Fired, and the Citizens who were com∣manded to stand to their Arms, made several Discharges and Vollies of Shot; Then followed Illuminations and Bonfires, and Fireworks were prepared at the Charge of the Publick for the same occa∣sion: But how much soever this was a mock-shew, yet great care has been ta∣ken to transmit such Relations to the Court, of all the particulars relating to their Proceedings and Success, as are drest with all the Art Imaginable, with a de∣sign to perswade them, who are but two
ready to believe it, that all the People every where, have Re-united themselves to the Church, with all the freedom and good will Imaginable; and because they were resolv'd to make sure work of it, they have accompanied the same Relati∣ons with Certificates, which they caused to be signed by the same means, as they have procured their Conversions, as they are pleased to call them; and wherein those who had suffered a thousand out∣rages and Violences, that cannot be nam∣ed without detestation and horror, were constrain'd to declare that the King's Soldiers, who of themselves are well known to be as profligate wretches as any in the World, had lived and demeaned themselves among them with all Mode∣sty, and had kept strictly within the bounds of their Orders, which yet, my Lord, is a base Equivocation, for who knows what their Orders were; but what is more pleasant yet then the rest is, that besides the forementioned Narrations and Certificates; they have Transmitted hither also a Speech made to the Intendant by Monsieur De V—a Member of the Parliament of Pau, who was one of the chief Instruments to induce the Church of that City to come to a compliance, and who taking upon him to speak in the Name of the
Rest, came to give him assurances of their entire Submission: But I hear, My Lord, he is like to have but little thanks for his pains, for the Council here are no ways pleased that he should attribute the Con∣version of that same Church, to the King's Puissance, and thereby make too clear a Discovery of what they have no mind should be known by any means, viz. That any of the Soldiery have been imployed in this Expedition, these were his words, which I take to be genuine, That there was need of the same Force that had Subjugated both Seas, and also made the Spaniards humble, to cause the Reformed to Re-unite to the Church. Which Words being not to be Explicated any other way, than by Force of Arms; and concerning which, the Spaniards willingly acknowledge, That the Power was much more Formidable than the Justice of them; the Council have Stomacked it, and the more it seems, because the same Lawyer has fool∣ishly and impertinently Attributed the best part of that Conquest to the Intendant; Which Procedure did not concur, and fall in right with the Court Maxims, who are wont to attribute to the King alone, all the Glory that Redounds from all Events. I shall not Transgress, my Lord, by any further Enlargment upon this Subject, hoping your kind Interpretation
of what I have here troubled your Hon∣our withal, and that you would be pleas∣ed to retain a Favourable Opinion of my Sincerity in all the Parts of my Cor∣respondence, and give me leave, still to Subscribe my self, as I really am, and ever will be, My Lord, Your Lordship's To Command. Paris, Sept. 30. 1685. N. S.
LETTER XIV. Of the Violences offered to the Barons of Mompeton, de Mauzac, de Vichase, and de la Mothe. My Lord, HAVING not yet any better En∣tertainment for Your Lordship, then by pursuing the same Subject I have of late dwelt upon, in the Course of my Correspondence; I shall once more adventure upon a short Relation of what has lately come within the Verge of my Intelligence, concerning the Barbarous Usage of the Barons of Mompeton, de Mauzac, de Vichase, and de la Mothe; and the rather, since, If I am not much mistaken, I have heard your Lordship formerly mention some of their Names, and particularly, de Mompeton, as being of your Acquaintance, when you Tra∣velled in this Kingdom: These Gen∣tlemen were Members of the Church of Montauban, where lately the Dragoons are come; but it seems, before they be∣gan to exercise their Fury upon the poor People, it was Contriy'd, by the Prime
Commanders, how they might entrap the fore-mention'd Honour'd Persons, as being of Great Authority among the rest of the People, and capable to draw others to follow their Example; but yet observ'd to be of as known Inte∣grity, and of whom they were in despair to compass their Ends, unless it were by Surprize; wherefore they had notice given them secretly, that in order to prevent the Pillaging of their Houses, they ought to go and pay their respects to the Marquess de Boufflers, who being a Person of Honour himself, would not fail to use them as such; Whereupon the Baron of Muzac, having presented him∣self first, at the House where the Mar∣quess had taken up his Lodgings; He was made to wait in the Anti chamber, till such time as the Intendant and Bi∣shop, (who had notice given him of the Design) were come thither; when they came, they went into the Mar∣quesses Chamber, by another Door, and Concerted Methods with him, how they might get the Baron to become a Roman Catholick: After they had pitch'd upon the Measures they were to go upon, the Baron was order'd to come in; and after long Discourse used to him, for to in∣duce him to become a Voluntary Con∣vert, the Bishop began to speak, and
said, There was no need of so much ado with that Gentleman; that there was no more to be done, then to bring him down upon his knees, and he would too rights give him Absolution of his Heresy. Whereupon, a parcel of Ruf∣fians there at hand, seiz'd upon the Ba∣ron, foyl'd him, and brought him down upon his knees: This Insolent and bold Carriage, the fear of the Danger, the Consternation it brought him under, to∣gether with the Fall, so far prevail'd up∣on his Spirits, that he Swooned away; so as that those Miscreants, who brought him into that dangerous condition, had much ado to recover him, and bring him to himself again. There happen'd, it seems, to be a Knight of Malta in the place; who, being a Man of great Honour; and finding that this way of Converting the World, was a very odd and new way, and little agreeable to Christianity, he would have taken him away out of their hands; but, so intent were these vile Sparks on their Enter∣prise, that they would by no meanes give way to the Intercession of the Knight, unless he would charge himself with be∣ing responsible for the Baron's Conver∣sion; But whatever the Gentleman did for the keeping of his Word with them, towards bringing of the Baron to a
Compliance, I am credibly inform'd, he could not prevail; but that the Soldi∣ers were those who got their Ends on him; and, that having, by a Terrible Method, viz. By forcing him to keep continually awake, without any inter∣mediate Rest, they brought him at last to Dote, and be beside himself, when they Extorted his Signing. This bad success did not discourage the Conver∣tors, as they were call'd; for the Baron de Vichase entring a little after to pay the same Respects to the Marquess, they would have used the same Violence to him; but though they got him down, yet he bravely got up again upon his Legs, and clapt his Back against a Wall, and his Hand to his Sword, and that with such a Resolution to defend him∣self, in case he was Assaulted, that they chose rather to give him over, and push the matter no further: The Baron de Mompeton was the last that came; who, though of such advanc'd Age, as being near Seventy four years old, and of such Qua∣lity, as being Lord of a very considera∣ble Borough, in the Diocess of Montau∣ban; yet had no more respect, nor pity shew'd him then the rest: for they set upon him in the same manner as they had done the rest: but happening fortunate∣ly to be Booted and Sparred, his Spurs
hindred them from throwing him down, and his firm and stout Expressions stopp'd the Bishop's Mouth, and he escaped, tho' he was taken afterward in his Flight out of the Kingdom, and Condemn'd, ac∣cording to the Rigorous Proceedings of this Court, to the Galleys: and though his Age and Quality, besides the Great Sollicitations made at Court, in Favour of him, might render the matter very easie to be obtain'd; yet it was with much difficulty that he was got to be exempt∣ed from that odious Condemnation, and this was given out as an Extraordinary Mark of the King's Clemency: The Baron de la Mothe avoided the Smart, by not appearing at the place for that time; but he was punish'd soon after, by ha∣ving his Two Fine Houses Destroy'd: And lately, through a tedious Misery of a Prison, they Extorted a Compliance from him. I hope this will find your Lordship in Health, and free from such—in this Ticklish Time, which shall be the daily wishes of My Lord, Your Lordships most humble and most de∣voted Servant whilst Paris, Nov. 13. 1686. N. S.
LETTER XV. Of the Revocation of the Edict of Nntes, how Monsieur le Tellier the Chancellor hastned it, and his own Death. My Lord, THE Parliament is not yet open'd here: when there was no doubt made of it, but that it was fully de∣sign'd the Edict of Nantes would have been revoked; but most People were astonish'd to see the Revocation come out before the said time, and great inquiry made into the secret of this un∣expected procedure; for though the vio∣lences I have, in some of my former Letters to your Lordship, given an account of were really such, if not worse than represented, yet they were Christened with the Name of ma∣king Converts by fair means; and the Court would make the World believe it to be so at all points. And to elude
the poor Reformed with the vain hopes that they should yet enjoy the benefit of the Edict a long time: they had an Order put forth the 15th of September in favour of them, in respect of Marria∣ges, which they had, for a long time, before sollicited for in vain: But, it seems the Chancellor has been the means to hasten it, as I am credibly inform'd: For finding himself burdened with years and Infirmities, and fearing least he might be overtaken with Death before the Fatal Blow were given; he did, at last, by fresh and repeated Instances (al∣leadging, he could not live to the time the Edict was design'd to be Nullified, and that he was not willing to die be∣fore he had put the Seal to the Revo∣cation of it) obtain his ends; But, my Lord, it's very observable, that he had no sooner done it, by putting to the Seal, but that he neither would, nor could Seal any other Order whatsoever; but Died here three days ago very uneasie, tho' he Blasphemously said (when he had done it) the words of Old Simeon, That after he had seen the Salvation of the Lord, he would go to his Grave in peace. I do not question but your Lordship had heard before of the Revocation of the Edict, but the Death of the Chancellor,
and Circumstance of it, I suppose you have not, and that is the occasion of my troubling you with this Letter, which I shall conclude, with Suscribing my self, My Lord, Your very humble Servant. Paris, Nov. 2. 1685. N. S.
LETTER XIV. Containing some Observations upon the French King's Edict in Octob. 1685. for the re∣vocation of the Edict of Nants, made in fa∣vour of the Reformed in the Reign of Henry the Fourth. My Lord, I Have very lately given your Lordship an ac∣count of the Death of Monsieur le Tellier, soon after the revocation of the Edict of Nants; I am apt to believe your Lordship has not seen the said Revocation, and therefore, to keep my Hand in ure, and for want of better matter to gratifie your Honour's Expectations, I shall de∣scant a little upon the Particulars of it: After the Prefatory part of it, it's asserted as a con∣stant Truth, That the Edict of Nants was not given, but with a Prospect to revoke it; That not only the King himself, since his accession to the Throne, but even his Father and Grandfa∣ther Henry IV. had a Design to bring the Re∣formed back to the Communion of the Roman-Catholick Church; and that civil and foreign Wars have been the only Cause that had re∣tarded the execution of that Design; That be∣fore the conclusion of the Truce in 1684, Af∣fairs were not brought to a fit disposition to bring it about, and that till now they had been content to suppress the places of their Worship,
and to abolish some of their Privileges; and that in order to make way for the accomplishing of this great Work, the King was the more easily brought to conclude the said Truce: this being prefaced, the rest contains twelve Articles, im∣porting in general, That all Edicts made in fa∣vour of the Reformed are null; That the Reformed Religion shall be no more exerci∣sed in the Kingdom; That all the Ministers shall be hanish'd, yet with Promises, that if they became Converts in a limited time, viz. in fifteen days, they and their Widows after them should be provided for, &c. That no Reformed Schools shall be kept in the Kingdom; That all Children, for the future, shall be brought up in the Roman-Catholick Religion; That those might return into the Kingdom in four months who were out of it, else to have their Goods confiscate; That none, for the future, shall dare to go out of the Kingdom, under Penalty of the Galleys, &c. That such Decla∣rations as have been made against those that re∣lapsed, shall be in force; but, last of all, it gants the Reformed liberty to remain where they please, in the Kingdom; to continue their Trade, enjoy their Goods, without any molesta∣tion or trouble, under pretence of their Reli∣gion; upon condition notwithstanding that they shall not exercise the same, nor keep any Assem∣blies under pretence of Prayers or any other Worship whatsoever. But how specious soever this Article may seem, it's already apparent, that 'tis but a meer Illusion, and that there is much Cruelty couched under it: It would insi∣nuate to us, that the King had no design to for∣bid domestick Worship, and to enforce Mens Consciences, since this expression, Till such time
as God shall be pleased to enlighten them, has been added, as one fine spun Thread to the rest of the Net: but the Court and Clergy have made it already appear, that this was the least of their Thoughts, since they have actually caused the Troops to march towards the Provinces that have not yet been ravaged; tho'at the same time the chief Magistrate of this City has assembled the principal Merchants here together, to con∣firm to them, by word of Mouth, what was contain'd in the Edict, and to assure them, they had nothing to fear upon that account. And this has had a very pernicious effect already, for it has sent many home into their Houses again, who had taken measures to be gone, with their Families, out of the Kingdom; for the most distrustful persons could not perswade themselves, that so solemn a Promise could be made with an intention to break it the next op∣portunity; but Experience has very quickly taught them, that the Imprudence to return was to no other effect, than to receive the Dra∣goons into their Houses; and now, when 'tis too late, they come to know, that the Mar∣quess de Chateauneuf had no other design, than to lay a Snare for the credulous, by a base equi∣vocating Phrase, and such as the Jesuites usual∣ly have made use of in forming the Orders and Declarations concerning Religion, which have passed thro' their Hands; and that by adding to those words, waiting till the Lord shall be pleased to enlighten them, these same, as others; he meant no other, than that the Dragoons, who had enlightned the first Converts, should also be the Dispensers of the same Light to those who continued still stiff and opinionative. But I shall, in my next, give your Lordship further
Information of this base and double-dealing, so much to the Dishonour of this Court, and the Ministers of it, from whom, as in the Litany,—I commend your Lordship to the Divine Protection, and shall ever while I live do so, and remain, My Lord, Your Lordship's most devoted Servant. Paris. Dec. 10. 168. N S. LETTER XV. Of the Marquess of Louvois's Letter, autho∣rizing the severe Prosecution of the Reformed. As also an Order by him signed to the same purpose. My Lord, I Have made a kind of a Promise to your Lordship, when I writ last, to give you some further explication of the double-dealing of this Court upon the subject-matter of the Edict of the Revocation, and particularly that Article that seemed to contain so much in favour of the Reformed; and such, my Lord, it was, that the very Romanists themselves thought fit to suspend the course of their violent Proceed∣ings against them upon it: And therefore Mon∣sieur the Duke de Noailles, who had receiv'd Orders for the Province of Languedoc, which
that Clause formerly mention'd seem'd to re∣voke, had, upon the perusing of it, recourse to the Delphian Oracle of this Country, for the solution of so great a Difficulty; upon which the Marquess de Louvois, the Gallican Apollo, soon disabused him, and returned to his Que∣stion this decisive Article: I doubt not, but the quartering of a few Troopers more than ordinary upon those few of the Gentry and Commoners, that still remain of the Reformed Religion, will quickly undeceive them, and convince them of the Mistake they have been in concerning the Edict, which Monsieur de Chateauneuf hath drawn up; and His Majesty's Pleasure is, That you would make an explication of the same very severely against all those, who will be the last to make a profession of a Religion that does not please him, and the exercise whereof he hath thought fit to prohibit through all his Dominions. But, my Lord, this is not the only Letter nor Order to this purpose; for I have had the ad∣vantage to see some others to the Officers of the Army and Intendants; importing, That for the further convincing of the incredulous, it was declar'd, those Violences were order'd by the Council; and, in short, the Marquess de Loavois was the principal Author of these cruel Expedients: But, above all the rest, I have privately seen an Order signed by him, where∣in is express'd, That the Copy thereof should be sent to the Marquess de Verac, and which ended with these remarkable words: It is His Majesty's Will and Pleasure, that you make use of the utmost Rigour and Severity against all those who are not willing to become of his Religion; And those who will have the Vain-glory to con∣tinue to the last of the number, must be used and
prest upon to the utmost extremity. I'll leave it to your Lordship's Wisdom and known Sagaci∣ty, to ruminate upon and judge of this Leger∣demain Procedure, and crave leave to acknow∣ledge (tho' it be never out of my mind) the many Favours you have been pleas'd to shew up∣on all occasions to, My Lord, Your Honour's, humble servant. Paris, Decemb. 14. 1685. n. st. LETTER XVI. Of an Order prohibiting the Reformed to fre∣quent the Chappels or Houses of the Ambassa∣dors of Foreign Princes. My Lord, OUR Court here, it seems, have thought it a little too low to descend to forbid the Reformed to frequent the Protestant Chappels of Foreign Ministers, and therefore they have consigned that pice of Drudgery unto the Ci∣vil Magistrate of this City, who has done it in such terms as are as like to another Equivoca∣tion I have already mention'd to your Lord∣ship, that it cannot otherwise be than a Pig of the same Sow; for the Order does not men∣tion, Tat those who were still of the Reformed Religion should not be present at any Divine Worship in the Houses of Ambassadors, and of
other Ministers of Foreign Potentates; but it has a term of Expression that is very singular and pretty, calling them those who say, they are still of the Reformed Religion; as if it were now somewhat strange or criminal, after what hath been mention'd in the latter clause of the Edict of Revocation, whereof I have some time since taken particular notice to your Lordship, to continue still of that Religion, to which it hath promised so little support, or use the freedom to say it: But hereby 'tis plain, they are intent to cut off the only Resource and Consolation they had left them under their hard Fortune, by enjoyning 'em not to frequent those Religious Ex∣ercises practised in privileg'd and exempt Houses. And while the Roman-Catholicks in all Protestant Countries have the Liberty publickly to be pre∣sent at their own way of Religious Worship, which is celebrated in the Houses of all Popish Ambassadors, the unhappy Remnant of the French Protestants are hereby utterly deprived of the little Conveniency which they had, both seldom and secretly, of presenting themselves at the Houses of Protestant Ambassadors, there to pay their Devotions with some marks of Union. One should think, my Lord, the Foreign Poten∣tates should resent this; but, alas! that Inte∣rest seems to be quite in the Wain, since our Native Country has left holding the Scales, which I cannot less than deplore, tho it's out of my power to redress: But, who knows what your Lordship—I am, My Lord, Yours in sincerest Affection and Sense of Duty. Paris, Dec. 16. 1685. N. S.
LETTER XVII. The Reformed in France are prohibited to en∣tertain any other Servants than old Catho∣licks, &c. My Lord, THIS Kingdom swarms still, as it has done for some months backwards, with meer Edicts and Declarations; and that chiefly about the poor distressed Reformed, whom they think they can never depress low enough. It was in July last that they were forbidden to take any Domesticks into their Service that were of the Roman Communion; and now they are order'd to take none but old Romanists to be their do∣mestick Servants; and the same Injunctions reach also the new Converts. It's a sad and me∣lancholy Subject, I do confess, but were it of less importance, one could not forbear laugh∣ing, to consider, that what was pitched upon as highly useful and necessary, in the Month of July, for to obstruct the pervertion of Catho∣licks, could some five months after retard the Conversion of such as might have been of the Re∣formed Way in the Service of persons of the same Religion; as if in the Month of July, when al∣most half the Kingdom was over-run with Dra∣goons, and who did every where commit the terriblest Ravages imaginable, any one in his Wits could imagine that those of the Reformed Religion should think upon the perverting of
any of the Roman-Catholicks to their Way; or that in the Month of December the handful of the Reformed, who are accused by the King's Declaration to persevere still in their erroneous Opinions, are in a condition to take into their Service all the rest of the Reformed, who are brought to a state of serving other People to gain them an honest Livelihood, and by this way to hinder the efficacious means, which the King declares he doth make use of for the re∣ducing of this poor People to Obedience. It's impossible for me, my Lord, to decipher to you the daily Hardships put upon these forlorn People, whose Miseries daily have an appea∣rance of further aggravation and encrease, which, I know, must aggravate your Sorrow, and therefore I shall forbear any further en∣largements hereupon, and content my self to profess how ready I am to give your Lordship all the Satisfaction that lies in my power, and to continue, My Lord, Your Honour's most humble Servant. Paris, Jan. 16. 1686. N. S.
LETTER XVIII. Of Alien Protestants, their Usage in France; and the Severities shew'd to the Dutch Con∣sul at Nants, and others. My Lord, YOUR Lordship may have been desirous to know all this while, that since the French have been so cruel to their own Fellow-subjects and Natives, how Strangers fare amongst them; and therefore I shall give your Honour my Thoughts upon this matter, as far as any Par∣ticulars have come to my Knowledge. It's not long since that we have seen an Order here, giv∣ing Leave to all Protestant Strangers to have free egress and regress into the Kingdom, with their Wives, Children, Servants, and others of their Nation, at Will, and with the same Freedom and Liberty which they enjoy'd in times past; but they are strictly charg'd to carry none of the King's Subjects out with them, without ex∣press Leave under the Secretary of State's Hands, nor to exercise their own Religion, whatever Religion they be of; which last words were dden in craftily by the Jesuites, after that of Protestants, to the end they might en∣hance the Divisions amongst them, from which the Missionaries drew their greatest Arguments to entrap the simple and ignorant, and where∣by they would tacitely insinuate, That all the Sects which at this day dishonour the Christian
Religion, and which agree in any one thing with Protestanism, are so many Protestant Sects: Tho' it's well known to the World, that all True Protestants both shun and abhor their Communion. Such an Order was certainly, at this time, highly necessary; for, tho' no Or∣ders have been issued out for to hinder those who would not become Romanists to enter the King∣dom, yet the Court was afraid their rigorous Proceedings against their own Natives would deter others, as thinking they could expect no better Treatment, nor more Safety in their Persons and Estates in France than natural Frenchmen; but how little Benefit many Alien Protestants have received hereby, is notoriously known in every part of this Kingdom; and the Dutch Consul at Nants has sadly experienc'd the same; tho' one should have thought his Quality was able to secure him against any Vio∣lences to be offer'd him in that kind. It has been usual, my Lord, for Foreigners, who have resided in this Kingdom, relying upon the Pub∣lick Faith, and flourishing by Commerce, to love to take care to preserve the Fruit of their Toil and Pains in a Country where the Right of Inheritance took place upon their taking Let∣ters of Naturalization; wherefore many such are to be found here this day, who never dreamt that they should be molested in their Religion, and thereby run the hazard of losing their E∣states also, as thinking it to be a matter very conformable to the Rules of Justice and the Law of Nature and of Nations, that they should be reducd to their primitive states, as others, when the Kingdom thought fit to revoke the Edicts, under the protection and duration whereof they had made these Advances; and alledging, That
they did not become Frenchmen, but conditio∣nally, that they might enjoy the Freedom of their Consciences; seeing without that they would never have taken those Engagements: or if the Government thought not fit to observe them, the least it could do, was to remit them to their former Liberty, and to give them their Choice, either to enjoy the Priviledge of their Letters, whereby they were naturaliz'd, by turning Roman-Catholicks, or to lose that Ad∣vantage, and to be look'd upon for the future as no other than Strangers, if they persevered in their own Religion. But these Pleas, tho' full of Reason and Equity, hath little availed any of them, for they have been generally treated with the same Rigor and Severity as the rest have been: And to this end there are and have been forty sivelling Pretences rais'd, to involve them in the same Misery; if any of them have French Wives; if they have Chil∣dren by them of such an age, born in this King∣dom; or if they have a Father or Mother-in-law living with them; this is enough to quarter the Dragoons upon them. In short, my Lord, I cannot see how it can be safe for any Protestant to come and reside in this Country, notwith∣standing what is contained in the forementio∣ned Order; for tho' this Court might be pun∣ctual in the observance of it according to the Letter, yet seeing it doth positively forbid, that such Strangers should exercise their Religion here, it brings but a small Remedy to the Evil they have apprehended might arise by the Fear which might possess the Minds of Foreigners from residing and trafficking amongst them, un∣less such Protestant Alliens will be content (which cannot be generally thought of them) to live
without any Worship at all; for they must ex∣pect, if they do otherwise, tho' it be their private Devotions only in their Families, to be liable to the Rigors of the same Inquisition with the French Protestants themselves. I find they are resolved here to carry all things with an high hand; I heartily wish it may be no Pat∣tern to our—I remain, My Lord, Your most humble and most devoted Servant. Paris, June 2. 1686. N. S. LETTER XIX. Concerning the Ignorance of Popish Convents. My Lord, IT's scarce credible how ignorant the Popish Convents in this Country are of all good Literature, especially the Women-kind, who have entertained such monstrous Notions con∣cerning the Principles of the Reformed Chur∣ches, that without I had had it from incon∣testable Testimonies, I should not abuse your Lordship, and hazard my Reputation with you so far, as to mention it to you. I know not whe∣ther I have formerly given your Honour to un∣derstand, that it has been a frequent Practise here to put young Maidens of the Protestant Faith into Religious Houses, to be tutor'd
there, in the Catholick Faith, and where they have found the grossest Ignorance both of their Prin∣ciples and Practises, as ever would have en∣tred into the Thoughts of rational Animals: They have looked upon and entertained them as if they were such as had no Belief in JesusChrist; and not only so, but as such as did not pray to God, but invoked Calvin or Luther only; by others they were looked upon as Jews that had not been circumcis'd, or did not eat any Swines∣flesh. With a thousand such Chimera's and Ab∣surdities have the crafty Priests filld the Nod∣dles of those simple Women, who think all they say an Oracle. But tho' many distressed per∣sons have been extream Sufferers, and felt the Effects of these Prejudices in a most rigorous manner, yet we are not without Examples of others, who when by their Piety, Innocence, and Knowledge they had disabused those who have the charge of them, have been treated by them with much Tenderness and Humanity. I would not, my Lord, have continued a Correspon∣dence so little to your Honour's Information, had I not lain under your Commands for my so doing, and that you have always express'd your Satisfaction with my Endeavours to serve you, who am, My Lord, Yours, in all humble Observance.

LETTER XX. Of Mareschal Schomberg, and the M. de Ru∣vigni's Retreat out of France; and of the Favour shew'd to the Marquess du Quesne, with the Reasons thereof. My Lord, I Do not question but your Lordship had ac∣quaintance with Mareschal Schomberg, when some Years ago in England; you may, perhaps, see him there again in a short time, for he hath with very great difficulty, notwithstanding his many and signal Services for this Crown, obtai∣ned Leave to depart the Kingdom, but under very hard Restrictions, the number of his Do∣mesticks being limited, and the Vessel wherein he embark'd view'd very narrowly: The Court before his departure appointed him Portugal for his Retreat, that so that same Country, where he has been known for so many Victories, might become unto him rather a place of Exile, than Retreat. The Marquess de Ruvigni had always some measure of the King's Favour, but that, toge∣ther with all the Interest he has had with his Mi∣nisters of State, were little enough to procure him Leave to retire with his Family into En∣gland; but whether arrived there, your Lord∣ship can tell much better than I. As for the Marquess de Quesne, tho' fourscore Year old, and a person that hath deserved so much for his
long and glorious Services, and under whose Conduct the Naval Power of this Kingdom, heretofore so inconsiderable, was become formi∣dable to all the World; yet he hath not been able to obtain Leave to go finish his Days in a Prote∣stant Country: But the Court have complemen∣ted him seemingly with a great Favour, viz. to continue in this City, with Assurance he shall not be molested upon the score of his Religion; but no doubt but this Favour hath proceeded more from Court-policy than any Good-will; for they are, it's very likely, afraid, that had they granted him Leave to depart the Kingdom, he might go and inform Strangers of the state of their marine affairs, the Weakness and De∣fects whereof he knows, as well as he can dis∣cover the Strength and Power of the same; and as for the Liberty of his Conscience granted him, they found that also expedient, to hinder him to practise his escape by one Artifice or other, if he were menaced with any Constraint. I did not think once matters would have been brought to this pass here; but when they are at the worst, there will be Hopes they will mend, as I hope I shall in my Intelligence to your Lordship, who am, My Lord, Devoted to serve you. Paris, Spt. 4. 1686. N. S.
LETTER XXI. Of Monsieur Claude's Book, entituled, A Protestation, in the Name of the Re∣formed; winked at in France, and King James made their Drudge to burn it in En∣gland. My Lord, TO think that your Lordship hath not seen and read Monsieur Claud's Protestation in the Name of the Resormed, were to judge very disrespectfully and diminitively of your Curiosi∣ty, and therefore for me to descant upon it, can∣not but be nauseous; but give me leave to ob∣serve to your Lordship the different Procedure of the two Courts at this time, tho' its not doubted here, and I hope in a short time to give you a further account of it; but that they are entred into very close Measures and Designs to∣gether, which will appear in due Place: No∣thing can be heard on this Side but the loud and dreadful Cry, of Constrain them all to come in, while our Emissaries, in conjunction with their Popish Leyitical Brethren on your Side, are a preaching up a general Indulgence to tender Consciences, and a Sovereign Duty, to grant equal Toleration to all Opinions; and one would almost believe both are sincere. But, my Lord, the Burning of the foresaid Book, which is an Abridgment of the History of the Persecution, by our King's Order, under Pre∣tence
of its containing a Doctrine contrary to the Authority of Kings, is an ill Proof of the latter; and an half-sighted Man cannot but see, that maugre all the Inclination that seems to be in the Court, towards granting Indulgence to others, their Designs must have quite another Tendency; but I find this Court has got the Ascendency, for they have cunningly enough judged it more profitable to dissemble the Injury they conceive they have received by the foresaid Book, than to take a Publick Revenge, for fear lest all the World should come to read a Piece that was so dangerous to them and ob∣noxious to their Interest; and when they well knew they had formed a Tool to do that to their Hands, with less Envy to themselves and more to::::: When ever they required it; I heartily beg your Lordships Pardon for my Freedom with you, who am, My Lord, Your very humble Servant. Paris Nov. 6. 1686. LETTER XXII. Of the League made between King James II. and the French King, Lewis XIV. My Lord, I Have once hinted to your Lordship, That both Courts were entred into very close Measures and Designs for to establish themselves
to the Prejudice of their Neighbours; as I should have been, and am very sorry to have disappointed your Expectations, after such In∣timations given you, I do now as much rejoyce that I have, tho' I may say, surreptitiously, got the Heads of the League lately made between them; for it is here with our Minutes as with other things, when they are fresh they are more choice and fond of them. And it was agreed in general, That our King should joyn with the French King in a War against Holland, both by Sea and Land, but in order to carry the same effectually on, it was more particularly con∣certed. I. That they shall both endeavour to draw the Prince of Orange to connive at such a War, and to consent to the Abolition of the Penal Laws and Test against the Roman Catholicks, with specious Promises of making him Prince of Holland, secure his Succession in England, and of many other great Proffers and Advanta∣ges; but in case he proves stiff, to endeavour to make a total Conquest of that Country, and share it between themselves, as was projected in the last Dutch War: And whereof, to the best of my Remembrance, I have give your Lordship a particular Relation; and then to find out some effectual Expedients to put the Prince of Orange by too of his Succession in England. II. That upon supposal that the Prince shall refuse to comply with them in their projected Designs; that then the English and Scotch For∣ces shall be recalled out of the Dutch Service, and be sent immediately into that of France, to be employed for a Time in remoter Campaigns,
towards Spain or Italy, and for want of such Service, in Garrisons, for fear they shall turn Tail and revolt, and so the Prince and the States of Holland shall be before-hand weakened, and the French considerably strengthened. III. That some thousands of the French choice Men, as of the King's Gentlemen Musqueteers, and others, shall insensibly be brought into En∣land, if the King finds his Occasions so require it, to be mixt with the English Troops, under Pretence of learning the other a more perfect Discipline. IV. That they shall both joyn their Forces at Sea, with all Strength possible. V. That a good Body of French, English, Scotch and Irish Troops shall be put on Board both the Fleets, that so a Mixture may be made in both, to the end it may create less Jealousie; and that the rest of the English and other Brit∣tish Troops, that can be conveniently spared from England, shall be employed in the Land-Armies, against the Republick of Holland. VI. That after the War be once declared, such French Refugees as will shew themselves willing to serve under the English Banner against Holland, shall enjoy the Revenues which they had in France, tho' they shall not be suffered to dwell there. VII. That neither side shall desist from the War, till a total Conquest be made of the said Country, which they think themselves sure e∣nough of: And that when Holland shall be sub∣jected by their united Force, there will then be no more Fear of any Opposition in England to prevent the King from raising Arbitrary Power and the Roman Catholick Religion there to the same heighth as it is in France, nor from
concurring with the French King, till he shall obtain the Empire for himself. VIII. That the French King shall pay all the Brittish Forces in Flanders and elswhere, and be content to defray half the Charges of the War, that our King with his Pecuniary Assi∣stance may be enabled to hold on the War with Vigour and Constancy enough for to make a Conquest; but that afterwards, for a Recom∣pence, he shall be obliged to assist France in any future War with thirty Capital Ships, and twenty thousand Men, at half Charges born. Your Lordship knows, much better to make a a Judgment of such a League than I can pretend to, but I perceive the effect will be dreadful, not only to poor Holland but to England too, without the neighbouring Potentates be time∣mously awakened to ward the Blow; and that such worthy Patriots as your self rowse up and stand in the Gap: But I pretend not to dictate to your Lordship what every generous English Man's Duty is to God and his Country upon such an occasion, and so conclude with subscrib∣ing my self, My Lord, Your very humble Servant Paris, Jan. 24. 1687. S. N.
LETTER XXIII. Of Methods to be practised by King James for keeping up the Dispensing Power, and and particularly about discarding the Mili∣tia of the Kingdom. My Lord, I Have upon another occasion hinted somewhat to your Lordship of those Arguments urged to the King for the promoting of the Dispensing Power; and you know very well, since it has been put in practise in Westminster-Hall, in the Case of Sir F. H. and how that matter ter∣minated to the King's Satisfaction, and further heightening of his Perogative Royal, and how the same was established by the Concurrence of the Judges of the Land, if they may be so cal∣led, who authorized the same: These Points being gained, another Matter and that of an higher Consequence was agitated in the Cabi∣net Council, viz. to use some means totally to discard the Militia of England, and in liew of them to retain standing Troops in the Na∣tion; and to throw a little Dust in the Peo∣ple's Eyes, and amuse them so as that they might take little notice, or at least not oppose those their Proceedings, it was advised to act these previous things. In order to Ballance the great Power of the City of London, it was projected to grant a Charter to that of Westminster, and that un∣der
the Pretence of its being the Royal Resi∣dence of the Kings of England, and of the su∣preme Court of Parliament, and therefore ought to be dignified with as ample Previledges as any City in the King's Dominions, London it self not excepted; and to have a Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen, Sheriffs, and all other Of∣ficers necessary both for the Support and Gran∣dure of it; that great Encouragement should be given to rich Merchants, wealthy Trades∣men, &c. to dwell there, and to transport a great part of their Trade thither, which would cause them to stick close to the Court, and Interests thereof. And had this same Project gone on, it was al∣so projected to have a new Stone-Bridge, imi∣tating that of London, but built much broader, and more convenient, erected between the Pa∣lace-yard and the Horse-Ferry, and the King seems very eager and forward to promote so useful a Work. Then the Mews was to be ditched round, and great care taken, as well as Expedition used to have it filled with Stabling and other Buildings, fit to receive and lodge a good Body of Horse, and to be made a Cittadel, under Pretence that such Troops should not be Troublesom and a Burthen to the said City. And when all this was accomplish'd, which was concerted to have been brought about in a short Time, then the Militia of the Kingdom was to be new modelled, two or three Times over, and the new Lords Lieutenants of Coun∣ties, and other Officers chopp'd and chang'd to the Court's Mind, who should shew them∣selves willing to obey the Orders they were to follow, which were to this effect. That the
Militia should be ordered to meet in their seve∣ral respective districts, and there the Lord Lieutenants for the Time being were to ac∣quaint them, That since to serve in the Mili∣tia was but a trouble to them, as well as a Charge and Burthen to the Country, yet without any Use or Security to the Crown or Kingdom, when all our Neighbour Nations were armed with Veteran Troops, the King was advised and now thought fit to discharge them of the Trouble, and the Country of the Charge of maintaining of them for the future; and so order them to deliver up their Arms, to be distributed among regular Troops, that would be more useful and service∣able. But before this was to be put in Execu∣tion, it was, my Lord, resolved, a Toleration of Religion should be first granted, and severe Orders given to the Soldiers for to pay their Quarters duly, demean themselves quietly and orderly, and to abstain from any manner of Vi∣olence; and all manner of Persons, as well Protestants, Dissenters from the Church of England, as others of the Roman Communion, should be admitted into the Army, either as Of∣ficers or Soldiers, and if any of the Church∣men should grumble thereat, and begin to sto∣mach it, it should be alledged, There was no Reason in the World the King should be deprived of the Services of any of his Subjects however de∣nominated, as to their respective Religions, for the Carping of a few Churchmen, who were more concerned for their own worldly Interests, and so would have all Places of Profit confined to those of their own Stamp, than they were for the real Interest of the Church. Then there were to be sufficient Bodies of Soldiers to be placed all over England, to assist the Lords Lieutenants
to see all the forementioned Orders put quietly in Execution, and ready to suppress any Tu∣mult that might be occasioned thereby. This, my Lord, was the Projection, I shall endea∣vour to give your Lordship, in my next, an ac∣count of the Opposition made hereunto, as this and the rest have been lately entred here in our Minutes, from Papers transmitted by the Re∣sident of Modena and Count Dada the Pope's Nuntio in England, to the Resident of that Name, and Papal Nuncio in this Kingdom, and by them communicated to Monsieur Louvois; till then I am and ever shall be, My Lord, Your humble Servant. Paris, Feb. 9. 1687. N. S. LETTER XXIV. Of the Opposition made by several Noblemen, and particularly by the Lord Marquess of Powis, against discarding the Militia of the Kingdom. My Lord, 'TIs but a few Days since I sent to your Lord∣ship the particular Resolutions formed in the Cabinet Council, of discarding the Militia, and other Methods that were to be pursued, as either previous to or subsequent of such a De∣sign; and now, I can assure your Lordship,
That same Project was chiefly broken by the Marquess of H. D—of N. and some other Noble Persons and worthy Patriots; but the Marquess of Powis had a greater Hand in it than any of them, as being of greater Credit with the King, who represented how dangerous and in a Word how impracticable such a Pro∣ject was; For, said he, it will be impossible to find such Lord Lieutenants in the Kingdom as will undertake to put the same in Execution, nor no Officers that will obey, If they could find such; that such a Practice would necessitate the King to call in a French Army, which would as much inslave his Majesty to the French as his own People would be thereby inthralled to him, and that he might assure himself the French Faction had no other Intent in advising him to it. So that I find, my Lord, it was resolved to let the Militia alone as it is, and go on to secure their Proceedings, by stuffing the Army with a Mixture of Nations as well as Perswa∣sions, and to chop and change them so often, till at last they shall get Roman Catholicks enough in their Troops so as considerably to out∣number the Protestants there, without calling in any Bodies of French. Which Resolution, as I find it did not fully content this Court, so it hath madded them to use Stratagems to coun∣terpoise it, by putting the King upon unsea∣sonable and impolitick Artifices, and among others, to model and pack Parliaments, where∣of I shall be able in my next, I think, to pro∣cure your Lordship the Projects laid before him, humbly hoping you'll take all in good part from one that has an English Heart, and will love both his Country and your Lordship, whilst I am. Paris Feb. 17. 1687. N. S.
LETTER XXV. Propositions made to King James II. by the French Agents for modelling and bridling of Parliaments. My Lord, I Find abundance of Projects offered to the King by the Agency of this Court concern∣ing modelling and bridling of English Parlia∣ments; some were for putting in Execution the Advises given formerly for that purpose to King I. I. specified I think in Rushworth's Collections, to which I refer your Lordship, but that Propo∣sition was rejected, and others of more modern date urged upon him, and particularly there were some who would have him procure a Par∣liament by Oliver Cromwel's Methods, chiefly to be composed of the Officers of the Army, with an Intermixture of some few others; and that being effected, he might by them increase very much the Revenue of his Crown, by set∣ting up again the Court of Wards and the Right of Purveyance, and by obliging all such Noble∣men who were by their Tenures anciently ob∣liged to furnish so many Horse and Men, and other Necessaries, in the Wars either against France or Scotland, to supply a full Equivalent towards Ships, Men, Artillery, Provisions, &c. for a War with the Republick of Holland, or any other Enemy whatsoever; which they would have called for the greater Amusement of the
People, a restoring to the Crown the Jewels which had been usurped from it; which that it might be further secured, it was likewise ad∣vised, That a Star Chamber, with the same Ju∣risdiction as in the King's Father's Time, should be set up again; as also an High Commission, which last tho' a sort of Tribunal introduced into England, since it had proved schismatical, and that the Kings thereof had been declared Head of the Church, yet it might very well serve a present Turn, and give the less Jealousie of his designing to introduce the Roman Catho∣lick Religion among them thereby; but that if he did not look upon that Expedient season∣able, and that the rather because it had been abolished in Parliament as a Grievance to the Subject; he had no reason to oppose the setting up of an Ecclesiastical Commission, since the Parliament themselves had erected the same, tho' with a more limited Power than the other in lieu of it; and since they had judged it ne∣cessary for the repressing of the Insolencies of the Churchmen, regulating their Manners, and obliging them to discharge their respective Duties in their several Stations, He being a Ca∣tholick King had more reason than any other to make use of it; the last your Lordship has seen, they have gained, and tho' the King hath a great Stomach to that other, yet my Lord Powis's Party hath yet prevailed and affrightned him from venturing upon such things without he had been able, as he found he was not, to have succeeded in pulling down the Militia of Kingdom, or at least in getting such an Army which he could fully rely upon, and that he hath not yet got neither; but till then he could not pretend to declare the Grand Charter void,
as obtained by Force of Arms, and since in∣fringed and nullified by several Rebellions, but especially by that in his Fathers time, on the Subjects side, and now rule by a Council only without troubling himself with any thing more like unto a Parliament as his French Friends Advised him to. your Lordship will excuse the Freedom I have now and always used in my Correspondence, and accept of my hum∣ble duty who am and ever intend to con∣tinue, My Lord, Your Honours to Command. Paris, April 7. 1687. N. S. LETTER XXVI. The substance of Pope Innocent XI. First Let∣ter to the French King, about the business of the Regale. I Cannot think but it will be acceptable to your Lordship to understand what the Con∣tents of the Pope's Letters to the French King are, especially in such a conjuncture as this is, and when I believe you cannot be fur∣nish'd with a genuine account by any other hand; after the prefatory part which is short and concise and somewhat different from others of his Predecessors, he comes close to the matter and says, that he could not but reflect
with no small Astonishment as well as great Grief and sadness of heart upon the late un∣accountable Conduct of so great a Prince, who would be thought to be and called himself the first Son to the Catholick Church, and with∣al the most Christian King against the holy See of Rome; that he should as much as pretend to so much Zeal for Religion, and yet at the same time, to invade the known rights of the Catholick Church; not only in the Kingdom of France, but even in the Ci∣ty of Rome herself, by pretending to a per∣nicious Freedom of Quarters, which all other Catholick Princes had freely and generously renounced as a gross abuse. That his Persecuting the Protestants in the Kingdom of France ought no ways to priviledge him to put affronts upon the holy See; it was very plain that was not the way to reunite those people to the Church, when he himself was so ill a Pattern, and shewed them so bad an Example, by contemning and outraging that same Authority, which he used Force and Violence to make them own; That he was much in the wrong, and acted prepo∣sterously to Prosecute them for not believing what he himself so Scandalously opposed; And that for himself at the bottom, he was not of a Persecuting Spirit and Principle; but that he was fully convinced, it was never Christ our Saviour, nor any of his Apostles way, who themselves never were nor ever used any Preachers with long Tails, Boots and Spurs, &c. That such a practice had done most disgrace to and created, as well it might, more im∣placable prejudice against the Roman Catho∣lick Religion than any thing else whatsoever,
and so by Consequence had much more obstru∣cted than advanced the propagation of it: That it ought never to be used in any King∣dom already infected with heresie, tho' it's true, it were a very good fence against its creeping in where it had yet got no footing; That it would be a means to blast all the blooming hopes of the Catholick Cause in the Kingdom of England, and ingender pernicious Jealousies and a most cruel Opposition in the English, a stiff necked people and the most Jea∣lous of their Religion and Liberties of any Nation upon the Earth, against their King who was a true Son of the Church, and break the Neck of all his designs for the In∣troducing of it into his Dominions: And in a word, that he was so far from approving of it, that he every way disliked it, and that it should not throw dust in his Eyes from in∣specting into and opposing of his incroach∣ments upon the holy See, which he was resol∣ved to defend to the utmost extreamity; and so concluded with a short admonition, and with which concludes this Letter to your Lordship from him who is, My Lord, Your most Devoted Servant. Paris, June 3. 1687.
LETTER XXVII. An account of Pope Innocent XI. Second Let∣ter to the French King about persecuting the French Protestants, &c. My Lord, SInce my last I have had the opportunity to take the Heads of another Letter written soon after that I have already sent you, by the Pope to the French King, and is to this pur∣pose. In the first place he takes upon him to re∣fute the Answers and frivolous Complaints of the French King, and then descends to ridi∣cule his vain pretence of Piety in persecuting the Protestants of his Kingdom for denying him Obedience, while he was no less severe to the Bishops of Alet and Pamiers and some other Ecclesiasticks, and even to some poor A∣besses and their Nuns for paying that Obedience which was due to the papal Authority; that this id not only look like it, but really was nothing less but building up the Church with the Left Hand and at the same time pul∣ling it down with the Right. That he was well informed what writings came out in France against his Authority, which he well knew, was that of the holy Apostolick See; what Theses were there main∣tained, and what was done by his over awing
the Assembly of the Clergy of his Kingdom, how and what method, he had taken to vel the French Jesuits against him, and imploy∣ed Maimburg, to represent his supremacy as precarious, Itineran and Ambulatory; and not fixt to the City of Rome herself, but on∣ly to the Capital City of the most power∣full Christian Prince in the World for the time; that is, gallice to Paris in the present Age: that he well understood not only this, but also the designs that were formed by him to erect a new Religion which should Total∣ly swallow up and deour both Roman Ca∣tholicks and rotestants, and how far he pur∣posed to imitate King Henry VIII. of England who writ a Book for the Pope's supremacy, and not long after Burnt aed Beheaded peo∣ple for owning it; when also at the very same Time he persecuted the Protestants for opposing other points. That it very ill became and it was not the part of a Dutifull and Religious Son s he pre∣tended to be and would have the Wold be∣lieve, to abuse his supream Pastor; to dispoil him not only of his Ancient rights, granted him by his Pious Predecessors, but even of those very ones which he then injoyed and were derived by Universal consent and constant tradi∣tion of all good Catholicks, and of the rights of his just Sovereignity in the City of Rome her∣self. That however let him the French King do what he pleased, yet all that ever he should or could do, should not make him abate the least jot or tittle of his just pretensions about the Regale, nor the franchises of Quarters: but that he was resolved to be Pope in France
and Sovereign in Rome, from which no Force should ever make him depart or flinch back the least degree, whatever Dangers he were ex∣posed unto: This great Constancy, My Lord, in the old Pontiff, hath not a little appalled the exorbitant Pride and Fury of this Court; however they have put the best Fa: they can upon it, and seem resolved to break through all Opposition, and outbrave whatever shall be in their Way, and divert their Resolution; and I am assured the French Embassador Lavardin at Rome hath already, pursuant to his Orders from hence, highly menaced the old Dad, who in a third Letter to the King has made answer∣able Reply, of which I am pretty confident I shall in my next transmit to your Lordship the Particulars, but in the mean time remain, My Lord, Your Faithful Servant. Paris, june 19. 1687. N. S.
LETTER XXVIII. The Contents of Pope Innocent XI's third Letter to the French King, in answer to that of h; wherein he shews his Folly and Mistake in his Pretentions and Demands, and threatens the Censure of the Church against him, and shews the Inconveniency and Danger of setting up a Patriarch in France, &c. My Lord, I Wish your Lordship as much Satisfaction in the perusal of this Letter, as I have in keep∣ing my Promise made to you in my last about the Pope's third Letter; in getting Sight of the Minutes whereof, I have met with much greater Difficulty than I expected, or was usual with me; I have already hinted Monsieur Lavardin's Menaces made at Rome upon the subject matter of the former Letter; and therefore the Pope begins his with answering those Menaces, that imported that the King should affranchise France from the Roman See, nominate a separate Pa∣triarch there, and elect Bishops of his own without having any Recourse to the Bishop of Rome, and in the mean while invade the Pope's Territories with his Arms, and force the Fran∣chises for his Ambassador; and fiercely reply∣ing, That he is resolved, as in Conscience
bound to do, to transmit the Franchises and all other Rights of the Apostolick See to his Suc∣cessors as he found them. That he would recognize or allow of no Bi∣shops of the King's nominating, till he had Sa∣tisfaction about the Regale; that if he would be so heady as to proced o nominate a new Pa∣triarch, it would make a greater combustion in his Kingdom than he was aware of, to which his Persecution of the Protestants would not a little contribute which he should find would be very unseasonable for him, and would in all likelihood raise all Christendom against him, as well as his own Subjects; that thereby he would make a wide Gap to let in an Inundation of He∣resies, which he pretends to keep out, and would teach the People after they had once tram∣pled on the Pope's Authority, to trample at last on that of the Bishops and King's too, and even on their very Persons, as they had done in England; and that when he had pulled down the mighty Dam of the Papal Power, and let that raging Sea in, it would be out of his Power to stop it where and when he would: wherefore he conjured him and his Clergy to consider seriously, yea twice and thrice of that weighty Project, before they went to put it in Execution, lest they might, when they found it too late, repent it, and in vain attempt to recal the same. That he must not think to fright him with the Noise of an Invasion; for that tho' he would neither arm himself nor the rest of the Princes of Italy against him, as he might do, but oppose only Prayers and Tears, yet if he desied not from his pretended Regale and Franchises, he would excommunicate Lavardin
his Embassador, and interdict his Kingdom, and and set it in such a Flame about his Ears, as should make him glad to go tamely back again, and look after his own Home; that after all, should he sack and Plunder Rome, captivate his Person, and have all other Successes he could imagine, it would be a very inglorious Expedi∣tion for Lewis the Great, the eldest Son of the Church, and such a pretended Bigot for it, for to ravage its Territories and assault the supreme Pastor of it with those Arms with which he was bound to defend it; and but a small Triumph to so great a Conqueror to over-power and marty∣rise a poor, helpless and unarmed old Man, as he was, for whom some of his Predecessors would have been content to have become Mar∣tyrs themselves; and therefore conjures him to think once more very seriously of it, and then to act as he pleased, but withal assures him, That neither his Menaces nor his Arms shall make him flinch an Hair's breadth from those his last Resolutions, wherein he was fully re∣solved to persist to the last Drop of his Blood. Thus, my Lord, you have the brave Resolution of a Roman Pontiff, who, tho' the Title and Dignity of Christ's earthly Vicegerent be falsly ascribed to him, yet undoubtedly he is possessed of a Soul above that of common Mortals, and whom I therefore honour and esteem, as I have always done and ever shall your Lordship, who am, My Lord, Your most humble Servant Paris, June 28. 1687.
LETTER XXIX. Of the Tryal and Suspension of the Bishop of London, by vertue of the Ecclesiastical Commission. My Lord, I Have once and again intimated to your Lord∣ship some Methods that were proposed to be prosecuted, in order to the setting up of the King's Dispensing Power, and among other things, to the best of my remembrance, taken notice of the Ecclesiastical Commission, with the Reasons urged to the King for making use of it; and now you have seen the Effects of it upon my Lord of London, whom some of them have said, They were resoved to be revenged on, for doing his Duty in the House of Lords, by moving after the Lords had voted an Address of Thanks to the King for his Speech to that Session after the death of the D. of Monmouth, in his own and his Brethren's Name, That the House would take the King's Speech into consideration and de∣bate the same; but this way was not then re∣solved on, but several others projected, which yet they found impracticable; when the Com∣mission was agreed to be erected, they had even then an Eye to the Bishop, tho' no plausible Pre∣tence for the Prosecution of him, and therefore the said Commission lay dormant for some Months, till such time as they might see the Ef∣fects of another Project to be put in Practice,
which was, That some Reglements made in the late King's Reign, in the Year 1662. importing, among other things, The Clergy in their Sermons should not meddle with State Affairs, nor en∣ter upon any Question that concerned the Rights of the King's Subjects, nor to treat of some Points in Divinity which formerly had created great Troubles in the Kingdom, particularly those of Predestination and Free-Will, nor yet to mixt Invective Reproaches, Railleries and scandalous Expressions with their Controver∣sies, should be republished under a very strict Injunction of all Parties concerned to the ob∣servance of them; and the least Transgression in that kind to be punish'd with the utmost Se∣verity; they did not question in the mean while, but that in so ticklish a time, there might be some one or other, especially in the Diocess of London, whom this Bird-lime might catch; your Lordship knows how it fell out accordingly, in the Case of Doctor Sharp. Tho' they were mighty jealous of the old Gentleman of Canterbury, that if he were no∣minated in the Commission, and should chance to act, which was the least of their Thoughts he should, he might rather thwart than promote their Designs, yet being pretty confident he would not concern himself with it, they ad∣ventured to put him in, not for his Authority but his Name-sake only, for, considered they, should we get the Bishop of London once into the Toyl, he will have no room to plead to the Jurisdiction of the Court seeing the same was founded upon the concurrent, tho' in truth but nominal, Authority of his Metropolitan, to whom he owed Canonical Obedience; these things your Lordship may know much better
than I, but I cannot forbear giving you any Hints of the Court-Designs, which whether projected here or on your side, we have con∣stant Intelligence of in our:::: I am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most humble and devoted Servant.

My Lord, YOur Lordship may call to mind what I have before written to you concerning Tollera∣tion in Religion, as necessary to facilitate the King's Designs, and now you see it hath sprout∣ed up in Scotland, and the Buddings of it are visible enough in England; that the Parliament of the former as well as the latter opposed the Dispensing Power is notoriously known, so that there was much less Hopes they would have concurred to the Indulgence, a Point as neces∣sary to be gained every whit as the other; that the Scotch Nation were more modelled to the King's Hand than the English, the King himself well knew; as having a personal Share in it
when high Commissioner in that Kingdom in his Brother's Reign, and the French and English Jesuitical Faction knew this as well as he; and therefore I am assured both of them concurred to have the Indulgence given there first, and that also in so partial a manner in fa∣vour of those of the King's Religion, that the rest have hardly any Share therein; which manifests plainly the Design of the English Catholicks whatever specious Pretence they may otherwise use, is to bring the People of England also under the same, nay a worse Yoke of Servitude, and to have their own Religion predominant quickly, and in Time the only one in both Nations: And as for the third they are cock sure of that already; but that of the French Emissaries is not so visible and above Board; for they hope such partial Proceedings must at last incense the People of both Kingdoms and that to so vi∣olent a degree, that the King must of neces∣sity have recourse to call in French Force to quell them: and then, my Lord, when they have once got sure Footing, who can guess at their farther Aim; however, they have not with all their Intrigues been able to pre∣vail with the King to use the same Partiality in England, who according to the Transmis∣sion of their Intelligence hither seemed very much inclined to it, upon their urging the Tractableness of the Scotch Council in the Matter, and what a great Pattern they had set to them of England, whom they did not doubt but would abrogate the Laws made against Roman Catholicks, &c. in imitation of them; but a Roman Catholick Lord, whom I have formerly named to your Lord∣ship
to have interposed upon the like Occasion, thwarted them therein; he deserves well of his Country in some respects, and I do not question but your Honour is of that mind; and so shall I be, till I see more than I do now to incline me to the contrary, who am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most humble and obedient Servant. Paris, Sept. 5. 168. N. S. LETTER XXXI. Of the French Projects to put King James upon desperate Measures in Ireland; and their Ends therein. My Lord, YOur Lordship may remember how I have formerly given you the state of the Irsh Soldiers in the Service of France, during the late King's Reign, and what Encouragement they have had here from time to time, above any of the rest of the Brittish Nations, and the large Promises that were now and then made, That they should be reinstated in their ancient Possessions in their native Country. But this King hath no sooner ascended the English Throne, but that they have as readily return'd into England and Ireland, as they were willing before, even contrary to their Allegiance, to re∣main in the French Service; the Reason where∣of your Lordship must needs know, they having
already devoured with their Eyes the most va∣luable Preferments in England and Ireland (in the later whereof they have got a Lieutenant of their own stamp) and more than all the Lands which they have been debarr'd from by the Act of Settlement; having (as I can assure your Lordship) a previous Promise from this Court, That the King will use all imaginable endeavours to get his Brother of England to con∣sent to abolish it; and which has put the Irish so hotly upon renewing their Importunities to the King against the said Act, that he hath in a man∣ner agreed to those measures that are pursuant thereunto; in which motions the Irish were order'd to be effectually seconded by the Emissa∣ries of this Court, who at the same time have encourag'd the Irish privately with a Promise; That if after all, the King would not give his full Consent, or durst not do them Right, their Master was resolv'd to do it; provided they would chuse him for their Protector, which they might lawfully do, being at best but a con∣quer'd Nation, against their Conquerors, for the recovery not only of their Native Rights in that Land, but likewise of those afresh con∣firm'd to them by the Treaty, (whether preten∣ded or real, I will not determine upon that Head) with the late K. Charles II, of which the French King was Guarrantee, and therefore justly might and ought to be call'd in as a Vin∣dicator. And this, my Lord, is confess'd here, That they had form'd so strong a Party among the Irish, that if the King had not in some mea∣sure comply'd, or does not for the future, but fail'd their Hopes by keeping it, as the Interest of his Kingdom, one should think, naturally leads him, to that side of the Ballance against
France, and maintaining the Act of Settlement, they had bid fair, as I have heard it more than whisper'd here, for a general Revolt of the Irish Natives in their favour, whom they had provi∣ded to succour on a sudden, without declaring War, or the least Intimation beforehand of their Designs, to the King. But now having prevail'd with him to make such Advances as he has begun against the said famous Act, which they have looked upon, as it were the Band of Peace, not only to Ireland, but even to the Three Nations, and perhaps they are right enough in their Judgment; they believe they have hereby put him on a Point that will quick∣ly bring him into Distress enough to need them; and, consequently, to the necessity of taking his future measures from them, expecting hencefor∣ward a more implicite Complyance than ever. Thus, my Lord, have they laid their Founda∣tion, the Success and Event, Time must deter∣mine: but from such undermining Politicians, Good Lord, deliver England, &c. for the Dan∣gers which threaten both its Religion and Civil Liberty are very great, tho', I hope, not inevi∣table. Pardon the freedom in these Particulars of him who is, and ever shall remain, ready to please your Lordship to the utmost of my power, and cannot but subscribe himself, My Lord, Your Honour's most humble and most obedient Servant. Paris, Mar. 26. 1687.
LETTER XXXII. Of K. James's Closetting several Persons; and the Arguments he was advis'd to use to them to consent to the Abrogating of the Penal Laws and Test. My Lord, YOur Lordship, for ought I know, may know much better than I can inform you, what Arguments the King has us'd to such as have been lately Closetted by him; and if Fame be not a—, you are one of that number; for a List of them is not yet come into our—; but I can transmit into your Hands what has been concerted here in the nature of Instructi∣ons to the French Emissaries at White-Hall here∣upon; they were to represent to the King, and he to the closetted Gentlemen, That there were four Kings who had endeavour'd to bring the King∣dom of England into an Uniformity in Religion, that so the People might live in Amity one with another; and notwithstanding all the Expedi∣ents, tho' seemingly very likely to take effect and succeed according to wish, which wise Poli∣ticians had suggested from time to time; yet they had hitherto proved abortive, and their Endea∣vours had been in vain: That therefore the only way left for to settle Tranquillity in a State, so as to be no more to be disturb'd about Religion, was to grant every one the freedom fully to en∣joy
his own: That such an Iudulgence of all Religions in Holland was as much a cause of the flourishing of that State in Wealth and Great∣ness, and more than any other that could be assign'd; and to say that such a Liberty, tho' it might be compatible enough with a Republick, was not yet with Monarchical Governments, was a gross Mistake; and Experience shewd it to be quite otherwise both in the Turkish Em∣pire, Kingdom of Persia, and elsewhere, where the Greek and Armenian Christians have been tolerated in their Religion for many Ages, and yet have been so far from being mutinous, or Disturbers of the respective States they have liv'd under, that they are great Supporters of them, especially the Armenians, who are almost the only Merchants they have in that mighty and extensive Kingdom of Persia: That the Perse∣cutions which our Nonconformists in England have from time to time been under, had been the cause of the flight of many good Subjects beyond the Seas, of whom our neighbouring Nations drew great and solid Advantages; and that those who have staid at home have, by rea∣son of the Pressures they have labour'd under, provd uneasie, and turn'd Malecontents; and if they have not had Virtue and Constancy enough patiently to suffer under their Misfor∣tunes, they were alwaies ready to favour Re∣volts and enter into Factions, whereof they had seen fatal effects in the late Reigns, from which no King could be able to secure his Person and his Subjects, but that uneasie and turbulent Spi∣rits would be alwaies ready, under Pretence of Religion, which they abused, to disturb and molest them. Which Reasons the King was to back closely with large Promises of Favour, and
if he found any obstinate, to mix his Reasons and Promises with some Intimations of his Dis∣pleasure; and, upon an absolute Refusal, to proceed to divest some of their Places under him. and to alledge for a Reason of his so do∣ing, That it was not reasonable that they who refused their Services should enjoy his Favours; and that if hereupon any should be so audacious as to tell him, That this Practice of his was irregular and contrary to the Freedom which the Laws of the Land allow'd to them, especial∣ly as Members of Parliament, whose Suffrages ought to be spontaneous and free, they were to be put in mind, that they had forgot the Vio∣lences used by King Henry VIII, upon the like occasions, and the methods so many other Kings had put in practise, to engage their Parliaments to subscribe to their Wills: that they might consider that two of the most famous Parlia∣ments that ever were in the Kingdom of England had authoriz'd this Conduct, in the Reign of Edward III, and King Richard II, when some of the Pope of Rome's Bulls were contested, as being looked upon too much to entrench on the King's Prerogative; that the Parliament pray∣ed King Edward, and obliged Richard, almost against his Will, to give their Consent, by par∣ticular Conferences with the Members, to pro∣mise to use the utmost of their Power to main∣tain the King's Prerogative, and the Rights of the Crown, against that See, &c. But if that after all, the King should find, that neither Ar∣guments, Promises, Threats, nor Examples would do, he was advis'd to proceed in his Brother's Steps by uo Warranto, and so to concert measures with those that presided over Elections for the regulating of Corporations
whereon they depended, tho' this was by far the more tedious way, but yet there was one way to hasten it: for whereas new Charters, in his Brother's time granted in lieu of the old ones, were many of them retarded, because the Court-Officers insisted upon too much Mony; the King now might give positive Directions to such persons to dispatch them without such Considerations, with a Promise to gratifie them another way; and if he found that would not do, then he was to cashier such Officers, and put others in their room who would engage to do the business to effect. I am afraid, my Lord, I have wearied you with an impertinent Letter; and therefore if an abrupt conclusion will any way mend the matter, I remain, My Lord, Your Lordship's most humble Servant. Paris. Nov. 19. 1687. N. S. LETTER XXXIII Of my Lord Castlemain's being sent Ambassa∣dor to Rome by K. James; and of his re∣ceiving the Pope's Nuncio in England. My Lord, THAT my Lord of Castlemain was sent Ambassador to Rome, has been transacted wholly on your side of the Water; for besides
that, this Court were then, and are still, at variance with the Papal See: There is not the least Instruction transmitted from hence (as far as I can find) either to England or Rome con∣cerning that matter; but perhaps he might re∣ceive them in transit, and by word of mouth, only from M. L. who failed not to see him: But as for Count Dada, the Apostolck Nuncio, as they call him, they have shewed some Con∣cern here that he should have an honourable Reception in England, and have order'd it so as to get our King to dispense with that Cere∣mony which Henry VIII, and even his Daughter Queen Mary, insisted upon, that he should wait like a Mumper at a French Port till he had Leave granted him to enter into England; And that the English Nation, who had not seen such a Vision for near an Age and a half, might not be overterrified with it, the French Agents were instructed to suggest unto those Lords and others whom they should think most susceptible of their Sophistry; That since the King, as a Ro∣man-Catholick Prince, could do no less than send an Ambassador to Rome to salute the Pope, tho' it were but for form-sake, and that his said Ambassador had had such an extraordinary Reception, and great Civilities shewed him there; it were but very equitable the King, in his turn, should shew the like to his Nuncio, who was a Layman, and in that quality came to con∣gratulate his accession to the Throne, from his Master; not so much as he sate in St. Peter's Chair, as he was a Temporal Prince, to whose Ministers, as such, the Law of Nations requi∣red a just Deference should be paid: That to send a solemn Embassy to the Great Turk, who was a Mahumetan, and a sworn Enemy to all
Christians, however denominated, was never so much as boggled at by any English-man or other Christian Nation whatsoever, either in this or any preceding Age: That the Ambassadors of the Emperor of Morocco had been lately recei∣ved in England most honourably, and yet their Master both a Mahametan and a Barbarian Prince, in whose Countries Christians were treated more like Brute-Beasts than Men; and should they disdain to concur with their Prince, to receive with some Ceremony, and if not by way of a publick and pompous Entry, yet pri∣vately in his Palace, a Minister from him to whose Civilities many of our English Nobility and Gentry were highly obliged in their Tra∣vels to Rome and Italy? But what Success they have had in this petty Agency, your Lordship can tell much better than I at this distance: but the Duke of Somerset is as highly exclaimed against here, for refusing to perform the Cere∣mony of introducing the Nuncio, as the Duke of Grafton is applauded for doing of it, who, I hope for all that, will never have the Thanks of a House of Commons for it. I am, My Lord, Your very obedient and humble Servant. Paris, Nov. 2. 187. N. S.
LETTER XXXIV. The French Politicks to embroyl England. My Lord, THE French Emissaries having gain'd severat Points, and particularly that mentioned in my last, they have lately turn'd their Batteries another way: They have been most of this while endeavouring to compass their Ends, by putting the King, and those who have most in∣fluence over him, upon desperate courses, where∣of the most material I have, as Occasion has served, noted to your Lordship. It will hard∣ly be believed, that they would offer to pro∣pose any Maxims to the Legal Party in England, that are really for their advantage; Did not their Instructions make it appear to be so, tho they have proposed far different Ends therein? I do not question but your Lordship has obser∣ved the Uneasiness of the Nation under the pre∣sent Proceedings of the King and Court-party; but tho they have just cause of suspicion, I must assure your Lordship the same has been and may still be aggravated by the Agents of this Court, who teach them to infuse into the People, That the Protestant Religion is in great danger; That the reduction of the Roman-Catholicks to the Bounds establish'd by the Law of the Land is highly necessary, and without the latter be effe∣cted, it will be impossible for the former long to subsist; That it was visible the Privileges of
Parliament were infinged more than in any time of their Ancestors: That Arbitrary Power was already acted, and without timely preven∣tion would get such rooting, that all the power of England could not dethrone it; That there was not scarce one made a Nobleman since the Kings accession to the Throne in the Three Kingdoms, but such as were Ppsts; and, That all Honours and Offices of Profit, either in Court or Camp, were shared amongst such, whilst the Protestants lay neglected as useless persons, and such as were deem'd to have no Share nor Lot in the Government; That the person of the King, it's true, was sacred, but at the same time it was not only justifiable, but an incumbent Duty upon them, as Englishmen, as they would answer it to God and their Coun∣try, timously to think of the Danger, and to ap∣ply the Remedy; for without the removal of such Ministers as then managed the State, it would be in vain to expect their Grievances could be redressed, and their Religion and Li∣berties secured; and if they find themselves har∣ken'd to, and their Propositions approved, they have further Instructions to hint an Association for one Expedient, &c. God Almighty knows what will become of poor England amidst so many Designs upon her Religion and Liberty, both by foreign and domestick Enemies, who continually prey upon her Vitals. I can but pray for her, as I do and always shall for your Lordship, who am, My Lord, Your most devoted Servant. Paris Dec. 13. 1687.
LETTER XXXV. King James (tho' already much disposed) put more out of Conceit with the Prince of Orange, who is represented by the French Agents very illy to him. My Lord, I Have in my last suggested to you some of those Arguments the Emissaries of this Court have and are to use to the Church of England-men, as they find occasion and a dispo∣sition to receive them, for to put them upon violent courses, to their own and Nation's de∣struction: But at the same time they have en∣tertained an incurable Jealousie of the Prince of Orange, and construe the most just and gene∣rous Actions of a Prince who was always so, in the worst sense imaginable, and, as such, re∣present them to the King, whom they cunning∣ly whistle in the Ear, saying; That he could not but know there were some persons in the Nation who were not pleased with his way of proceeding, and therefore would be sure to take all Opportunities to oppose him: That indeed now Monmouth was cut off, they had no plausi∣ble Head to retire unto: That for the Prince of Orange, tho' he had apparently omitted nothing since His Majesty's advancement to the Throne for the maintaining of a fair correspondence with him, and been very forward to pay all the De∣voirs
due from a Son to a Father-in-law, affect∣ing much Zeil for his Interest, and acting with his Ministers of State as if himself were the Prime of them: Yet they desire him to consi∣der the thoughtful and designing Nature of the Prince, who, to be sure, was not wanting to observe every pace made by the English, and to dispose of his own Affairs and People accor∣dingly: That His Majesty could not but remem∣ber the Applications made to him formerly, in his Brother's Reign, from England, when he was but Nephew to the King and himself; but now, that he was advanced by his Marriage to a much nigher Degree to the Crown, could it be thought that he had less Thoughts concerning it, or less Application made unto him on that behalf, especially in so ticklish a time? That some persons of note's going over lately into Holland, was no sign he was unconcern'd at the English Affairs, or unapplied to, but must needs give Umbrage, and more than a Suspicion that he had already a strong Party within the King∣dom; and that indeed his Conduct without was next to a demonstration of it, since he had done all that ever he could to hinder His Majesty from all the Succours he could expect from abroad, in case of any domestick Troubles; for tho' His Majesty was sure of France, and had made a general Alliance with Spain, and might then be apt to believe that the House of Austria would not oppose him, especially when the Catholick Religion was the Dispute; yet it was manifest the Prince had bid fair for the de∣oriving him of both those Supports, first by en∣tering himself, and then by causing the Uni∣ted Provnces to enter into the League at
Ausburg against France, to the end he might draw down upon that Monarchy the united Forces of the Confederates, in case the French King should offer to attack the States Ter∣ritories, while he might make use of their Power both by Sea and Land, to carry on his Designs against His Majesty and his King∣doms: And then, that he had render'd the House of Austria very suspicious of His Ma∣jesty, as being a Prince contrary to their Designs, one in Interests, and closely engag'd with France in a secret Treaty, which would appear in due time. I can assure your Lord∣ship, that by the Returns which have been made hither, the King has been but too susce∣ptible of these Calumnies against the Prince, and, I fear, to his prejudice, tho' I heartily wish it otherwise, who am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble and Obedient Servant. Paris, Jan. 11. 1688.
LETTER XXXVI. Of the Spaniards attempting to bring King James over to their Interest, but failed. My Lord, HOwever the Emissaries of this Court have traduced the Noble Prince of Orange to the King, yet they have in some sort given the Lye to themselves, when notwithstanding all their Rhodomantade, about the Prince's en∣gaging the House of Austria against his Ma∣jesty, they have been so alarmed at the Propo∣sals made to him by the Spaniards, of a strict∣er Allyance, which they knew, if entred into, must invalidate that made with them; the Em∣peror and King of Spain being suspicious of the Allyance with France, had entred into a Con∣federacy with the Princes of Germany at Aus∣burg, as I have hinted in my last; and that they might make their Party as strong as they could, and having at the same time no clear de∣monstration of our King's private Leaguing with France, they resolved to leave nothing un∣essayed, either to know that it was really so, or, if not, to engage the King in their Inter∣est; the Marquess de Gastanaga, Govenour of Flanders, and the Spanish Embassador Don Pedro de Ronquillo were the Persons employed by that illustrious House in that Affair; it's well known here that the latter has omitted no∣thing that could be done to bring the King over,
urging to him the Honour and Interest of such an Allyance; that it was the only Opportunity he had left to recover the good Opinion of his Subjects, who, he must needs know himself, were somewhat alienated in their Affections from him, with a great deal more to the same purpose; and he did at last proceed so far, well knowing his blind—as to engage, if his Majesty would enter into and be cordial in such an Allyance, to order it so that his Parlia∣ment should acquiesce with whatever he was then attempting to get established in respect of Religion, which he could never effect by the Assistance and Agency of France, their harsh Procedure against the Reformed there being too green and fresh in Memory to be so soon for∣gotten by the English, who had besides a natu∣ral Aversion to that Nation and their Politicks; But, my Lord, all that Don Ronquillo has done, was communicated to the French Emissaries, who presently took the Scent, and being not willing to give the King space to demur upon the Mat∣ter, lost no Time in remonstrating to him; That they who had told him, That he ought to take that Opportunity to gain his Subjects, by en∣tring into the League of Ausburg, had not re∣flected upon the inconsequence that followed upon such a Procedure; That that League now agi∣tated was but the consequence of another made at Magdenburg by the Protestants, in favour of the Hugonots; and that it were against all good Reason and Sense, that a Prince who did his utmost to procure a Liberty to Roman Catholicks in England, should concur to re-establish the most rigid of Protestants in France; besides, it would argue no good Policy for him to forsake a solid Friend, such as the French King was, to joyn
himself to such Princes, who would no longer be useful to him, than while they had need of him; since the Protestants had already begun to over∣reach their Piety, so far as to draw them into Leagues formed against a Catholick Prince, in favour of the Calvinists, whom he had driven out of his Dominions; wherefore the King made answer to Don Ronquillo in general Terms; That as he would faithfully preserve the Ally∣ance made between him and his Master, so the same Fidelity obliged him not to violate that Friendship which was between him and the Most Christian King, his Kinsman, who was willing to live at Peace with his Neighbours, and mantain the same as far as he could between them. Thus, my Lord, this hopeful Overture was blasted, the Consequence whereof I refer to him who knows all things, and to whose Protection I commend your Lordship, who am, My Lord, Your very obliged Servant to command. Paris, Mar. 16. 1688 N. S.
LETTER XXXVII. Arguments used to King James by the Lord Marquess of Powis, Pope's Nuntio, &c. against a War with Holland. My Lord, THat the King, pursuant to his late Allyances with this Crown, designs a War, in con∣junction with the French Arms, against Hol∣land, is no longer a Secret here, whatever it may be in England; especially since Don Ron∣quillo's Artifices to gain him over to the Austrian Interest, as I mentioned to your Lordship in my my last, have failed, tho' he were briskly se∣conded therein by the Lord Marquess of Powis, the Pope's Nuntio, and Emperor's Minister, whose Reasons or rather Remonstrances to the King upon that Head, for want of better Intelligence, I shall at present take notice of to your Lordship, as entred in our Minutes, and which indeed were such that 'tis a wonder he should withstand them, sed quem Deus— 1. They prest it very home upon him, That such a War against the States of Holland could not be attempted with any apparent Advantage to his Majesty, without a junction with the French Power, which yet in all human Proba∣bility would never enable him to conquer those Provinces, since both the Crown of Spain and the Emperor, nay the Empire would be obliged to protect them; to war with whom, especially
with Spain, whose Trade, as he well knew was most beneficial to England of any in the World, would be attended with such manifest Disad∣vantage, as all the Power of France, were that King a faithful Ally, would never be able to make the Nation amends for; and that supposing he should be able to conquer the said Republick, by the Assistance of the French Arms, yet to conquer it by French Force would necessarily but make himself, as well as that Nation a Tri∣butary and Underling of France. 2. That in all likelihood a War with Hol∣land, and against the House of Austria, would disgust his Subjects, and set them all against him, yea and perhaps move some hot Spirits to form Designs to dispossess him of his Throne; or at least, so far to make Opposition as to knock on the Head all his fine Projects for the Advancement of his own Religion in England, and engaging of his very Catholick Subjects against him. 3. That if his Majesty intended the re-esta∣blishment of the Catholick Faith in England, it was to be considered, that the same was a Work of Time, and required great Modera∣tion, but that they were sure the hot and furi∣ous Methods of France and the Jesuits would never effect it. 4. That to them, for the effectual bringing about of the said Work, there seemed a kind of necessity, that he should stay till the Discords be∣tween the Catholick Princes were so far ap∣peased as to be without Danger of breaking out in a long Time, for that all their Concurrence would be found to be little enough to enable him to accomplish his Ends therein.
5. That if he should chuse rather to enter in∣to a strict Allyance with the House of Austria against the French, he would thereby render himself secure of his People's Hearts and Affe∣ctions, of the Dutch Naval Force to strengthen him at Sea, as occasion required; and of all the other Allies Forces, to divert the French Armies by Land: And that if he should lose upon that account, as 'twas likely, any Remit∣tances from France, they assured him the Pope would allow him a much better Pension to coun∣tervail it; and that being engaged against France, his People would be so intent against the French, and upon that War, so agreeable to their Inclination, that they would not be so very jealous of, and so prying into the Advances he should make in the Change of Religion at Home; and that if by that means, than which nothing could be thought on more feasible, he could not settle that Religion, he might at least secure it, and make Matters easie to those of his own Perswasion. 6. That if his Majesty persisted to make War against Holland, which would inevitably draw on one with the House of Austria, if his Arms did not prevail so far as to come to an entire Conquest, he was certainly ruined, and all the Catholicks in the three Kingdoms along with him, without resource, and would perish unpitied, and without any Hopes or possibility of Succour from any Catholick Princes but the French King alone; and that if on the contrary, as it was the most unlikely thing in the World, he should prevail to a Conquest over Holland, and his own Country, that yet thereby he should, under the colour of an imaginary esta∣blishment of the Catholick Religion in the
Brittish Kingdoms, but settle an irreligious Ty∣rant over all Christendom, worse to the Ca∣tholick Religion and Christianity in general than any Heretick in the World, nay than the very Turk himself, and who would insolently trample upon the Pope's as well as his Fellow Princes Power, and set up a new Empire and a new Religion of a third sort neither Catho∣lick nor Protestant, but such as suited with his own ambitious Designs; as the Steps he had already made that way did sufficiently de∣clare: And so instead of resettling the Roman Catholick Religion where it had lost Ground, and in the Soil of Great Britain, which would prove but a Quick-Sand to it, he would destroy it all over Europe, where it was now established in terra Firma, &c. Ile leave it to the Decision of your Lordship's Judgment, whether these or the French Re∣monstrances carried most of Reason, Proba∣bility and Truth in them, as I ever shall all that comes from, My Lord, Your Honours most humble and obedient Servant. Paris, Apr. 30. 1688.
LETTER XXXVIII. Of the Differences continued between the Pope and the French King, and of King James sending am Embassador to Rome, to recon∣cile them. My Lord, I Have already transmitted to your Lordship the Contents of his Holiness's Letters to the French King, about the Regale and Franchises; but there seems now to be a Disposition in these two high stomach'd Princes to come to an ac∣commodation, and the Conjuncture of Time lies so to the Heart of this Court, that I am apt to believe they will precipitate an Agree∣ment; however, because their forwardness therein might be disguised as much as French Policy could effect, they have by their Agents insinuated to our King; That an Embassy to Rome from him about accommodating of the foresaid Differences must be very grateful to his Holiness, who paid more deference to his Ma∣jesty, and would further regard his Mediation than any Prince in Christendom; and that tho' the French Court stood very stiff upon their Rights, yet it was not to be doubted, but as they had so high a Valuation for his Friendship at all Times and Occasions, so he might be confident that in so critical a Juncture of Time, they would not be so purblind as not to see wherein their true Interest consisted; It was
no sooner, my Lord, proposed to the King, but accepted by him, and my Lord Howard is already arrived in this Kingdom, in his Way to Italy, as the King's Embassador extraordinary on this Errand; but notwithstanding this Court has so far prevailed by their Artifices in England to procure the Kings Mediation, yet an Acci∣dent, if it may be called so, has lately happened at Rome, which may perhaps blast all the bloom∣ing Hopes entertained from this mighty Nego∣tiation. For Monsieur Lavardin, Embassador from this King at Rome, receiving Information that some of the Pope's Marshals were got within his Quarters, he ordered his Men to seize them, and commit them to safe Custody; the Cardinal de Estree has endeavoured to alleviate the matter, and mollifie his Holiness Resent∣ments, saying; That certain Persons, who were no great Friends to France, had set them at Work, with a design to irritate Matters yet further between the two Courts; that he might be pleased to consider, that in the Posture Affairs then stood, that is, after his Holiness had accept∣ed the Mediation of the King of England, it would look ill to admit any Innovation; but the Cardinal was asked, Whether the King of France was Sovereign in the City of Rome? And supposing he had been really so, was there any Justice to arrest People as they passed along the Streets, that had a Design to make no man∣ner of Attempts upon any? That it was never yet known in any Country, or heard of in the World of any Law that condemned a Man upon a bare Suspicion; but supposing that were true, as it was not, yet it was most certain that the Punishment was reserved to the Sovereign and not to an Embassador; who whatever Latitude
he would have allowed to his Authority, could not pretend to any more than to be indepen∣dent in his own Person; that as for his Do∣mesticks, if they pretended to the same Ex∣emption with himself, it was no farther al∣lowable than they demeaned themselves Regu∣larly, as they ought to do; for if they did otherwise, they were subject to the ordinary Iu∣risdiction of the Place they were in; That there were a Thousand Examples for it, though there had been some Embassadors who had endeavoured to extend the Privilege of their Domesticks so far, as to maintain that they ought to be affranchised. That this pre∣tended right of Sovereignty by Embassadors was so far from beng true, that they had not as much as Power to punish their own Servants, for there could not be any one Example pro∣duced that any Embassador has intruded so far as to condemn any Person whatsoever to Death, tho' there have been many who have justly merited such Punishment; That it was true, they had sometimes reclaimed them when fallen into the Hands of ordinary Iustice, but that at the same time it had always depend∣ed upon that of the Sovereign to concede that Favour to them, or refuse them according as they were more or less just. These things be∣ing granted, which could not be otherwise, for they carried their own Light with them, how could it be justified that a bare Em∣bassador should dare to arrest not only his own Servants, but the Officers of a Sove∣reign Prince, and that even in his Capital City, and to heighten the Extravagance of
such an Action, even in the very Sight of him. Thus, my Lord, has the Old Gentleman resented the Injury, and I am afraid our King will have but little Joy of his Embassy, and in this Particular come short of his Grandfather's Motto of Beati Pacifici; how∣ever, his Zeal here for the Good of the Roman Catholick Church is highly applauded, but whether it be a Zeal without Know∣ledge, Ile leave to your Lordship to deter∣mine, and think my self happy in any Op∣portunity to serve you, who am, My Lord, Your very humble Servant Paris, July 2. 1688.

LETTER XXXIX. Of the Seven Bishops being committed to the Tower of London; and the French In∣trigues to embroyl that matter. My Lord, THE Commitment of the Bishops to the Tower, and the Birth of the Priuce of Wales, are things so agreeable to the Gusto of this Court, that they are overjoy'd at it, about the former of which this Court has been very busie: I will not positively say the Presbyterians had the first hand in it, tho' they have taken care to enter it into our Minutes so; and that they be∣ing willing to make some advantage of the Con∣tests of the Court, got it suggested to the King by the means of the Romanists, That in order to engage the Parliament to establish Liberty of Conscience, it was necessary the Bishops should be order'd to injoyn the reading the King's De∣claration in their respective Diocesses: That the matter could not be scrupled by them, since the publication of the King's Orders had been at all times an Usage in England, as well as in other Countries. But however this matter was first started, my Lord, I will not take upon me to determine, but it was carried on by strange Instruments; for as soon as ever the Bishops had refused to read the Declaration, and ad∣drest themselves to the King upon that account,
with their Reasons for noncomplyance; the Je∣suits about him, egged briskly on by such as are entirely at this Court's Devotion, represen∣ted to him the great Affront offered to his Au∣thority and the Regal Dignity itself by such a Refusal; and how if he suffered the same to go impunedly, it might open a Gap for it to be trampled upon without reserve, and who could tell where it would terminate? That since he had already in all other points carried the Rights of Soveraignty to a great height, sure∣ly it was not now time to dissemble and wink at an Adventure that put such narrow Bounds to his Regal Authority: That there was there∣fore an absolute necessity to call them to a severe account for such an audacious Act; That they might be tryed by vertue of the Ecclesiastical Commission, and with as much Justice everywhit suspended as the Bp of London was; and what would be a mighty Advantageous Consequent thereon, was, that the Privation of the Episcopal Au∣thority would advance the Regal Authority to such a pitch, as to be held in veneration by all the People. You know, my Lord, the Success these Remonstrances have had, but the variation of the Bishops Tryal is disavowed by this Court, and the cause of their being brought into Westminster-Hall attributed to the Chan∣cellor's swaying the King, and for which some have gnashed their Teeth at him. Upon the Acquitment of the Bishops, the English Jesuits were horribly spighted; and the French Emis∣saries laughed in their Sleeves; and that they might embroyl the Nation more, had Orders to insuate into any whom they thought fit for their purpose, That the Regal Authority had that Property in it, that it oftentimes subsisted
more in Imagination than Effect: That if the People did but once know their own Strength, they would find it an easie matter to shake off the Yoke, which certain Puissances imposed up∣on them, and with a great deal more, but in general Terms to the same purpose, with which I shall not at present trouble your Lordship; But they have at the same time spirited up the Jesuitical Court-Faction to importune the King, without any Intermission to review the Bishop's Cause, and bring them on to another Tryal; alledging to him, That such a Failure would undoubtedly add a Triumph to the People, whereof they had already given but too clear Signs, and considerably augment the audaci∣ousness of his Enemies, who were more in number than he could imagine; and that in short the only way to put both the one and the other to a profound Silence, was by not flinching from that Resoluteness and Constancy which he had made to appear since the begin∣ning of his Reign, for if he once began to flag therein, it would be quickly seen, he would proportionably sink in Reputation; That there∣fore great Care should be taken to retrieve this again, since, without that were done, he must necessarily fall into a greater Con∣tempt with his People than he was aware of, and from whence many Inconveniences would arise, which some of them could be as little foreseen as it would be hard to prevent them; That therefore, as the Case stood, it were much more adviseable for him to run the Risque of another Tryal, wherein if he succeeded, his Sovereign Authority would be not only main∣tained and kept entire, but the greatest Op∣portunity put into his Hands to extend the
Bounds of it as far as he pleased; but if it should happen otherwise, and that the Bishops should be acquitted a second Time (which as they designed to concert Matters) was not very likely; the Case would then be but the same, and no other than now, and as much to be feared from the one as from the other; but, it seems, the King was so dispirited with the ill Success of the first Trial that they found him entirely averse to venture on another; and therefore being not able to divert him from his Resolution of giving over that Game as lost, they made it their Bu∣siness to give out; That the King was not minded the Bishops should have been cast, that he had therefore given way that such a Jury should be returned, and their Cause to be solicit∣ed by all their Friends, as was a clear Demonstra∣tion that he had used all these Methods to deliver them from the Difficulties wherein they had plunged themselves, with this Design and Hopes; that the Sense of his Goodness might reclaim them back to their Duty, and that for the fu∣ture they might set a Pattern to others not to swerve therefrom; but I do not find by the Re∣turns made hither of these Expedients that they have met with any tolerable Success; your Lord∣ship may know much better than I, how this Affair is relished in the whole, and what is likely to be the Consequence, and so Ile leave it to your Determination, and remain, My Lord, Your Lordships most humble Servant. Paris, Aug. 8. 1688. N. S.
LETTER XL. Of the Prince of Wales's Birth, with the Sense of the French Court upon it. My Lord, I have upon another occasion hinted to your Lordship what Appearance of Joy there was at this Court for the Birth of the Prince of Wales; but they are now not a little morti∣fied at the Pasquils put forth in England and Holland to render his Birth suspected and the whole to be only a piece of Court Legerdemain to carry on the Catholick Cause; As for the later, the designs carry'd on against the King and his Ad∣herents as they are now no Secret to the World, so 'tis no wonder such Pamphlets are connived at; Then for England, its an Argument the Reigns of Government are of late much slacken∣ed, and that the Regal Authority is much in the Wain, when the King and the Courts Honour, is touched in so sensible a Part, and yet that no Redress can be made thereof, nor efficacious Remedy applied thereto; but I must tell you, my Lord, That tho' this Court has not so much reason to be concerned as that in England in this Point, yet such things dare not be much more than whispered here, because that upon the first broching of his being a supposititious Prince, there has been a very strict Charge given that none durst presume to speak of him otherwise than of a real Prince, neither dare the Cour∣tiers
even in private so much as emancipate themselves to speak otherwise, lest they should thereby, besides transgressing the present Orders, give also a Jealousie to old Lewis him∣self, that they designed obliquely to revive the old Disputes formerly raised about his own Legitimacy; but this I have heard them privately say; That could they have gotten away one of our Princesses (as I have for∣merly mentioned to your Lordship) to be mar∣ried here, and had had thereby another French Heir to put in, they believed the Prince of Wales would not be long-lived; But these things, my Lord, are ticklish things to meddle with at such a Juncture of Time. I pray God to keep your Lordship from all Harm, and to increase the Honours of your Family, and that I shall ever do, whirst My Lord, I am, &c. Paris, Sept. 12. 1688. S. N.
LETTER XLI. Of the Prince of Conde's Feasting of Monsieur the Dauphine. My Lord, THat the Dauphine commands the King's Armies upon the Rhine, I do not question but your Lordship has heard ere now, about which Affair this Court seem at this Juncture to be wholly taken up, o as that I have no∣thing of moment worth sending to your Honor: But before Monsegnior's Departure, the Prince of Conde has been pleased to regale him and all his Retinue, and that in a most sumptuous and magnificent manner at Chantilli; where several Ladies had also a Share in that Divertisement; the Prince, upon this occasion, distinguished himself in a very extraordinary manner; he presented himself before the Dauphine a great way in the Forest, where there were Illuminati∣ons, and received him in the Habit of the old Hea∣then God Pan, accompanied with a curious Train, all in Disguise like himself; some like Shepherds and Shepherdesses, others represent∣ing Satyrs, leaping and dancing at the Sound of Hautboys, Bag-pipes and such like Musical Instruments; the Dauphine being in this man∣ner conducted to the House, which cannot be said to be superb and stately, unless it be for the Gardens and Water-works about it, he was himself feasted with a magnificent Supper
and several other Tables were set for his Court; where he continued for Five Days, and was regaled in the same Plenty as at first, and from thence returned highly satisfied to Versailles; I must confess, my Lord, I could not forbear giving you this short account of the En∣tertainment, tho'it be ridiculous enough, especi∣ally in the Antick Preludium to it; but I know your Lordship has Goodness enough not only to pardon me, but to take in good part whatever comes from, My Lord, Your Lordship's most obedient Servant. Paris, Sept. 16. 1688. N. S. LETTER XLII. Of King James ordering Mass to be said on Board his Fleet, and of his going on Board himself to engage the Officers to turn Ro∣man Catholicks. My Lord, WHatsoever this Court is a doing, in refer∣ence to the English Affairs at this Time, there is little or no Appearance of it; but they seem to be much concerned at the Disappoint∣ment our King has met with, in not prevailing with the Officers of his Navy Royal to become
Catholicks; for me to make a Relation of that Transaction to your Lordship, I fear may be but Crambe bis Cocta, but your Honour being now remote from the Court at your Country Habitation, and that I believe we have here a truer account of that Affair transmitted to us by the Agents of this Court, perhaps your Lordship will not think your Time ill spent in perusing of it. Its seems the Commissioners which the King has sent to the several Coun∣ties of the Kingdom to dispose Men's Minds to a Willingness to take off the Penal Laws and Test, having generally found a grand Aversi∣on in the People to that Matter, the King was so incensed at the Report they made of it, and the invincible Stubbornness of the Nation, that he convened his Cabinet Council, and with them resolved to cashier all such out of his Ser∣vice as would not fall in with his Designs; But that all things might be opportunely executed, it was agreed he should make himself sure first of his Fleet and his Army, without whose Assi∣stance they saw it was in vain to effect so sud∣den a Change at once; wherefore he gave Or∣ders that Mass should be said on Board his Ships; but there was such Opposition made thereunto both by the Officers and Seamen, that the Priests, who went thither for that end, were forced to hide themselves for fear of being thrown over Board, which they had been like to have undergone, had it not been that the Principal Officers, who maintained still the Respect that was due to the King's Commands, had done their utmost to hinder it. But when the matter came to be represented to the King, his Fury was raised to an high degree, tho' he had for the Time the Artifice to dissemble his Re∣sentment;
wherefore he resolved to try whe∣ther his Royal Presence might not operate more than his Orders, and therefore he went on Board the Fleet himself, and having commanded all the Officers to bring him their Commissions, he there asked them, Whether they were not resolved to change their Religion and imbrace his, who had bestowed their Offices upon them, in Expectation that they would do whatever he commanded them? They were surprized at the Complement, and expected no such thing, nevertheless, being resolved not to be frighten∣ed either with Menaces nor be gained by Flat∣teries, they generally answered; That how devoted soever they were to his Majesty's Ser∣vice and their own Fortune, yet they could not be enduced to any thing against their Consci∣ences. To which the King replyed, That what he required of them could by no means be Pre∣judicial to them, whatever their Ministers might tell them to the contrary; that there was more of Opinion than Reason in the Reli∣gion which they professed; that they should take the Pains to reflect duely thereon, for which yet he would grant them but the Space of 48 Hours. But tho' most of them did believe from Words so positive by the King, they should certainly be casheered, yet they resolved to split upon that Rock rather than alter, whatever came of it. The King, in the mean Time, who had trusty Spies in all the Ships, having learnt their Resolutions, for all his eagerness in the matter, did not think it advisable to push on Things over far at that time; wherefore he ordered they should be told, when he sent them back their Commissions, That the 48
Hours which he had alloted, being not sufficient for the determining of an Affair of so great Importance, he was pleased to allow them some further time to think of it, but that they would please him to conform themselves to his Will on that occasion; but in the mean time tho' the Poli∣ticks of this Court have been much used in En∣gland, yet herein they have been laid aside, and there is an essential Difference between the one and the other, for in the Choice which our King makes of Officers, he had rather they should have Service than Profit; whereas in France they will have both the one and the other if they can, and for want of which, Profit is al∣ways preferred before Service. I'll not cen∣sure such an Attempt, but I am ashamed we should be laughed at both here and in other Countries for our Politicks, and your Lordship knows as well as any Man living, that when wise and experienced Statesmen have sate at the Helm, they never would suffer the Regal Au∣thority to be put upon such an Hazard, well knowing the least Resistance made thereunto is a Triumph to the People, but speramus meliora, I am, My Lord, Your Lordships to Command. Paris, Sept. 25. 1688. N. S.
LETTER XLIII. Of the Count d'Avaux acquainting the French King with the Prince of Orange's Prepara∣tions against England. My Lord, THe Embassador of this Court Monsieur the Count d'Avaux at the Hague, hath trans∣mitted a positive account hither of the great Preparations made in Holland for some grand Ex∣pedition, especially by Sea; intimating that the Prince of Orange seems to have other Designs in his View than those of a vigilant Statholder, for the maintaining the Dutch Fleets and Armies in a good Posture, now other neighbour Na∣tions are in Arms. You know, my Lord, Mr. Skelton is now Envoy in this Country from England, as he was some time ago in Holland; who while he was there, whether really or ma∣liciously I will not determine, was pleased to transmit an account to the King of the Prince's holding Correspondence and carrying on some Intrigues with his Subjects to his Prejudice; he had some Relations in the Princesses Family, by whose means he had an Opportunity to inspect into some Letters, from which he took upon him to pick out as much as gave him to understand, that there were some Matters agitated under∣hand that tended to the King's detriment, but as far as I could learn, the King gave little hd to his Informations; But what the Count d'A∣vaux
has given his Master an account of hath been esteemed worthy of Consideration, and added here some Reputation to Mr. Skel∣ton's Agency, whatever it may do in England; and I am assured, my Lord, from such Autho∣rity as I dare rely upon, that the French King has prest his Brother of England, to give that Heed to it which it deserves, and to take season∣able Precautions to defend his Dominions from a powerful Invasion wherewith they are threaten∣ed. My Lord, I desire to know with the next Conveniency whether I may be free to continue my Correspondence with your Lordship, espe∣cially if I find Matters of this Nature transact∣ed; for I would not for any thing in the World bring your Lordship into the least Praemunire, but in all things study to serve you with exact∣est Diligence and humblest observance, which I shall always strive to do, who am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most humble Servant. Paris, Octob. 6. 1688. N. S.
LETTER XLIV. Of the means whereby Mr. Skelton came to know of the Designs in Holland against King James, and of his acquainting the King his Master therewith. My Lord, MY last imported some Intimations to your Lordship of Mr. Skelton when the King's Envoy at the Hague, his discovering some secret Correspondence negotiated between England and Holland, as he judged, to his Master's dis∣advantage; I have also noted how the King had been advertised of it from this Court, where Mr Skelton is now in the same Quality, as at the Hague, and who, I can further assure your Lordship, has made a further Progress to un∣riddle the Intrigue since his Arrival, by the means of one whose Name is Budeus de Verace, a Protestant of Geneva; who having been some time since Captain of the Guards to the Prince of Orange, and having had the Misfor∣tune to kill a Man in a Duel, was casheered by him; Mr. Skelton being then at the Hague, and acquainted with the said Verace, found a way to reconcile him to his Master by the Re∣commendation of my Lord Clarendon, who having brought up his Son, my Lord Cornbury,
at Geneva, was under great Obligations to Ve∣race for the good Offices he had done him, and care taken of him; this Genevese being thus re-established in the Favour of the Prince, his Master, had it seems a greater Share of it than before, as he had also in the Secrets of Mon∣sieur B—his Favorite; however it was, it should seem by the sequel, that he was now by his second Introduction to Favour, become quite of Mr. Skelton's Interest, who was the Instrument to reconcile him; For not long since he has taken occasion to be dissatisfied with the Service he engaged in, and withdrawn, and being, as was given out, but whether so in reality or no, upon his return to his native City of Geneva, he took occasion to write a Letter to Mr. Skelton, now in this City, That the Noise about the Armamont in Holland was so far from being a false thing, or otherwise to be conceived, that it was a Matter of the highest Importance, and did no less than con∣cern the Safety of the Crown of his Master, the King of England, and that it was highly neces∣sary he should be made acquainted with a Son-in-Law, whom he knew not. This he desired Mr. Skelton to communicate to the King with all speed; but he was not willing to make any further Discovery of his Secret to any other save to the King himself in Person; if the King were so pleased as to send him Orders by Mr. Skelton to come and attend upon him. Up∣on the receipt of which Letter from the said Genevese, Mr. Skelton hath writ Five or Six Letters to the King in a very pressing, lively and urgent manner, but what effect they have had upon him, may be the Subject of another
Letter, and perhaps of my next, if my intelli∣gence fail me not, in the mean time I am and shall be, My Lord, Your Lordship's most humble and devoted Servant. Paris, Aug. 14. 1688. N. S. LETTER XLV. Of the Slights used to make King James negli∣gent to provide against the Inuasion from Holland. My Lord, I Do not find Mr. Skelton's Instances have had any great Effects upon the King towards quickening his Pace to ward off the Blow that seems to be preparing to be given him; And I have something more than a Suspicion, That it is the Desire of this Court, the Kingdom should be invaded, and that the Agents of it have been extraordinary busy to countermine whatever Advices have been given the King for taking a timely Precaution to defend himself, so that there is, my Lord, in this Case a Wheel with∣in
a Wheel, and whatever open Professions of Kindness is shewed him from hence by a timous Premonition of his Danger, there is as great Care seriously to thwart all by contrary Coun∣sels; And among other things, it has been eager∣ly urged to him, That the Prince of Orange continues to carry himself towards him with such a Conduct, as could not leave the least room to entertain any Suspicion of him, and could it be thought that a Prince who had shew∣ed his Devoirs to him, so far as to make his Complements as other Princes had done upon the Birth of his Son, the Prince of Wales, and caused the Name of his new Brother-in-Law to be added to those of the Princes of the Fami∣ly, for whom they prayed in his Chappel, should be unsincere, or have the least Design to molest him or his Kingdoms by Arms, especially since Van Citters, the States Embassador, had particularly assured him, That what Prepara∣tions were made in Holland did not regard En∣gland, but had given him to understand, That France had a great deal more Reason to be al∣armed than he: But after all, whatever were intended by such Preparations, which they were well assure were much greater in Fame than in Reality; his Majesty's Affairs were in so good a Posture that he had no Reason to fear any Enterprizes whatsoever; That he had a Land Army, a Fleet and such good Magazines as were sufficient to render the Efforts of al∣most all the complicated Powers of Europe in∣effectual, tho' such a Conjunction was as little to be expected as that his most Christian Ma∣jesty would abandon him; who, if he saw oc∣casion, as there was now but little likelihood, would no fail to support him with all the Power
of France both by Sea, Land &c. I will not be further Troublesome to your Lordship, but remain, My Lord, Your humble Servant. Paris, Aug. 8. 1688. LETTER XLVI. My Lord S—charged by some of the French Faction with Infidelity to his Master King James. My Lord, IF your Lordship should ask me, What the real Designs of this Court are in reference to England, in such a conjuncture; they seem to have other Sentiments now of the Invasion than they had a few days ago, when they were se∣cretly promoting the same Might and Main, as I have intimated not long since to your Lord∣ship, with a View to engage us in a Civil War, and thereby bring the King under a Necessity of calling in such a French Power to his Assistance as he should never be able to force out again; But now they seem to be quite against it, upon the opposition made by a great Minister of State to their Offer both of Men and Ships upon this occasion, of whom they talk strange things here, and say, that in regard to the King, however he has insinuated and winded himself
into his Favour more than any they could re∣commend or propose, he must be an Enemy re∣conciled only in a way of Policy and Necessity, that he had in former Parliaments pushed on the Bill for his Exclusion with greater eagerness and warmth than any other; That he had never attempted to recover his Favour, but when he had a Prospect to injure him thereby; that he is a Man intent to follow the prevailing Side, but that he had always, in case of any Change, a safe Retreat to the other side, that whilst he adhered to the Factions in Parliament, against the Royal Family and Interest, he had strict Correspondence with one of King Charles's L—, who found a way to reconcile him to his Majesty, and by his Mediation to the Duke of York; That being now come to be Prime Minister of State to the King, and almost the only one he had since his Elevation to his Bro∣ther's Throne, he had served him with Zeal, while there was a Prospect of Prosperity to attend him, but that he hath now no sooner perceived that there is a Party formed against him, but that he hath shewed himself ready to enter into a Correspondence with his Enemies, against him; That the Countess of S—writ∣ing to the Princess of Orange, That their Un∣kle H. S. a Man deeply engaged in that Inter∣est, was gone into Holland to attend the Prince, was no small Proof of her Husband's being engaged in the same Interests; That there could be no other Construction made of the Violence done to the King his Master, by his engaging of him, notwithstanding all his Aversion to it, to advance Father Petre against his own Incli∣nation, maugre the Opposition made by the Queen to it, and in spite of the most essential
Laws of the Order he was of, to be one of his Privy Council; That the King thereby, in satisfying of him, did on that occasion lose that Right which one should think he had to dispose of his own Subjects; That nothing else could be inferred from this Lord's Procedure and Carriage in the imbroiled Affair of the Bi∣shops, which he brought on into the Council, and which he yet favoured under-hand; That it cannot otherwise chuse but that the Contempt which this Minister has affected of all the In∣formations given the King his Master of the De∣signs of the Prince of Orange his Son-in-Law and of the Dutch against him, whereby he has in a great measure diverted him from using the means necessary to resist any Attempts made up∣on him, or impressions on his Dominions, must proceed from an ill Principle and Dissatisfaction to his Interests. I hope your Lordship will not take this Freedom ill at my Hands, which is nothing else but the Sense of this Court up∣on the present Occasion, and with which I shall now conclude, who am, My Lord, Your Lordship's most humble Servant. Paris, Oct. 28. 1688.
LETTER XLVII. My Lord S—excused by others of the French Faction, as to his Conduct in re∣spect to the Prince of Orange's Design againg King James and his Adherents. My Lord, THe Censure of this Court upon the late Conduct of a noble Peer and Prime Mini∣ster in England, as mentioned in my last to your Lordship, is not so universal, but that there are diverse others who have entertained a quite contrary Opinion of him, and say, That it is far enough from being an infallible Rule, that a reconciled Enemy can never become a sincere Friend; That it is possible a Man may reserve unto himself a place of Refuge and Retreat among a contrary Party, and yet be far enough from falling in with its Interests; That the Suspi∣cions of him are without any manifest Ground, since there is not the least Appearance that he hath personally linked himself with his Master's Enemies, or held any Correspondence with them that tends to the betraying of him; That what his Lady had done with the Princess of Orange, tho' it might be lyable to Suspicions in such a Conjuncture, is no sufficient Proof or Reason that the same Crime should be attribut∣ed to the Earl her Husband; That Col. S—tho' his near Relation, might yet deceive him, and make him believe that his Passage into Hol∣land,
was to no other end than for the Benefit of his Health, and a Journey to drink the Wa∣ters of the Spaw; That to say he turned Roman Catholick that he might the better serve the Protestant Interest, was so ridiculous in it self as to need no Consutation; That as for the Business of Father Petre, the Earl did nothing but what every wise Statesman would have done, viz. to seek out one on whom might be discharg∣ed the Envy of such things as should displease the People in the Court-Conduct, and so escape it himself; That as for any Enterprise by the Prince of Orange and the Hollanders against so potent a King as his Master, who was incom∣passed with so great an Army, it might appear to be so extraordinary and strange a thing to him, that he might believe it his Duty to neg∣lect such Advices as things unlikely, and not far from ridiculous; And that now at length he finds himself obliged to believe them to be real, those same Forces which the King his Master has on foot, might make him opinionative to reject the Succours offered him from hence, which he looks upon to be as well dangerous as unnecessa∣ry, but which if the Censures is most agreeable to Truth, Ile leave to your Lordship's Deter∣mination, and remain, My Lord, Your very obliged Servant. Paris, Oct. 31.
LETTER XLVIII. Arguments used by the French Agents to gain King James's Consent to receive French Succours into England, and Answer'd by my Lord S—. My Lord, YOur Lordship cannot but know of the Busi∣ness of Cardinal Furstenburg about the Ele∣ctorate of Cologn, and how he is supported by this King, whose Arms are advanc'd that way: It may be you have seen Monsieur Bonrepos also at London, whose Instructions were to offer to the King, in his Master's Name; That however his Forces are already advanced towards the Upper Rhine, and ready to enter upon Action, yet finding the danger His Majesty was like to be in from Holland, he was willing to prefer his Interests who was his Friend, before his own; And that if he found the King demur up∣on the matter, he was to tell him, That His Majesty ought to consider the thing, not as it was in itself, but in the present circumstances of it; That it might be justly feared his work was not to oppose only the Armies of others, but that he should be well assured that those very Armies with which he design'd to resist his Enemies, did not hold Intelligence with them, and concurr against him in the same Designs; That the chief Officers that commanded his Ar∣my
were faithful to him to such a degree, as to be Proof against being corrupted, which could not be said of the other parts of the State, who were wall known to be corrupted, which his Ar∣my, if they did not already, must shortly know; from whence he was to infer, that if the same Corruption should unfortunately happen to creep into the Army, as well as elsewhere, the King, in refusing foreign Succours (which in conjunction with those who should prove faith∣ful Subjects to him, would make at least a Par∣ty) would leave himself expos'd without any de∣fence to all the Forces of his Enemies. My Lord, you cannot imagine how highly dissatis∣fied this Court is at the rejection of their Aid, and that my Lord S—'s remonstrating to the King, That the introducing a foreign Army in∣to his Dominions that were Romd-Catholicks, and especially Frenchmen, would wound his Re∣tation very deep, and quite alienate the Na∣tions Affections from him, and be a confession of all the Rumors which had been seatter'd a∣broad of a private League made between him and France, for oppressing both the Liberty and Religion of his Country, And besides, the King had Forces enough of his own, and to spare, for the resisting of all the Efforts of Holland; That his Fleet alone was able to stop them, and that let it be as it would, his Land Army could not fail of being Conquerors over them, being both much more numerous, and withal better disci∣plin'd; had entirely fixed him in the said Reso∣lution. I do not question but this Court will do the Earl all the Disservice they can, for spoi∣ling so brave an opportunity of their getting ooting with their Troops in England; how∣ever
he has served his Country, and deserves well of it, whatever his Fate may be. I am, My Lord, Yours in all humble Observance Paris, Nov. 2. 1688. N. S. LETTER XLIX. Of Mr. Skelton's Negotiations in France, with the Reasons of his being recoeli'd and committed Prisoner to the Tower of Lon∣don. My Lord, I Cannot conceive but they are as much in the dark with you about Mr. Skelton's Imprison∣ment in the Tower upon his arrival in England, as they are concern'd for it here. I have alrea∣dy given your Lordship an account of some of his Negotiations both in Holland and at this Court, and with your Honour's leave shall en∣deavour a little further to unriddle this Mystery of his Imprisonment: When all the Arguments of this Court used by Monsieur Bonrepos to in∣duce the King to admit of some French Troops into his Country, under pretence of assisting him against the Prince of Orange, were obvia∣ted by my Lord S—'s Remonstrances and Assiduities, you cannot conceive the concerned∣ness that appeared here at the grand Disappoint∣ment; Mr. Skelton was almost oppress'd with
Enquirers into the reason of such a Procedure, (not knowing well then from what Quiver the Arrow was taken that shot down the Goliah of all their Hopes of once nestling in England) who examin'd, interrogated him, and almost laid it to his charge, that their Advice was not follow'd: But having at length found it to be otherwise, they resolved to put him upon ano∣ther Expedient, mention'd first by himself, to serve his Master, as they said, tho' nothing is more certain than that it is their own Interest they design'd mainly thereby: For one day, af∣ter Monsieur de Croissy had prest him hard still to sollicite his Master to accept of the Troops and Ships offered him by France, and that Mr. Skelton answer'd, That it was in vain, he having Orders to meddle no further in that mat∣ter, and therefore durst not move in it. He al∣so added, That yet he was of Opinion, that if his most Christian Majesty would order his Am∣bassador to acquaint the States-general what share he took in the Affairs of the King his Master, and to threaten to attack them, in case they un∣dertook any thing against him, he did believe that would quickly put a stop to the intended Invasion, and spoil the Measures the Prince of Orange had concerted thereupon, without giving the En∣glish occasion to complain their King had called in Foreigners into their Country: That this would be an effectual means to keep part of the King's Enemies on this side the Sea, and they might have leisure enough to break off the Cabals which the other formed at home against him. This Dis∣course made Monsieur de Croissy hasten to ac∣quaint the King with it, who liked it so well, that he immediately dispatched away a Courier to Monsieur the Count d'Avaux his Ambassa∣dor
at the Hague, with Orders to declare to the United Provinces, That they could not at∣tack the King of England, who was so intimate a Confederate with him, but that he must be obliged to succour him with all the Assistance he could. The States having paused a little for an Answer to this Memorial, and presently up∣on it being encounter'd with another from the Marquess de Albeville, the English, Ambassador there; they answered the latter, They were long since convinced of the League between the two Kings; That they had armed in Imitation of other Princes, &c. which being interpreted here, that the States were resolved to go on with the Invasion; It raised the Expectations of this Court, that the tender of their Troops would be still, accepted of by the King: But the vigi∣lance and sagacity of my Lord S—disjointed also this Project, and ended in the Recalling and Imprisonment of Mr. Skelton, for moving in an Affair for which he had no Orders. And this also, my Lord, has stopped Verace the Genevese, whom I have formerly mentioned to your Lordship, who is come to Paris, from pro∣ceeding on his Journey for London, as supposing it to no purpose to give such Informations as would not be regarded; and he is now, I hear, about returning back to his own Country. I hope things are well with your Lordship in these times of difficulty; had it been otherwise I do suppose I should have heard it, that I might have stopped my Intelligence; and that all may continue to be well with you, is the unfeigned Desire of, My Lord, Your Lordships most obedient Servant. Paris, Nov. 8. 1688. N. S.
LETTER L. Of the Prince of Orange's landing in England, and Success, with King James's Speech to his Chief Officers. My Lord, THo' the French Arms this year have had mighty success on the Rhine, yet the land∣ing of the Prince of Orange in England, with∣out any opposition, and the success he has met with since his arrival, together with the de∣section of some Horse to him under my Lord Cornbury, (tho' they say here but a very small number) has damped all their Rejoycings; And indeed, if we may judge of their Hearts by their Looks, we may see plainly that they have given over not only their own Game on that side of the Water for lost, but that they look upon that of the Kings so too, almost beyond all hopes of recovery; but yet that they may make some semblance of Zeal still for his Service, their Creatures have advised him to call toge∣ther his chief Officers, and to tell them; That he had given Orders for the calling together of a Free Parliament, as soon as a more setled time would give him room to hope for such: That he had resolved to provide for the Security of the Religion, Liberties, and Privileges of his Subjects, as far as they themselves could de∣sire or wish for; Could there any more he ex∣pected from him, he was ready to grant it?
but desired, if after all this there was any one dissatisfied, that they might declare it: That he was ready to give unto such as thought not fit to tarry with him, Pasports to go to the Prince of Orange, and that he would freely pardon them their shameful Treason. This Speech, and the effects it has had, your Lord∣ship may know much better than I; but it is now talked here, that it has met with so little success, that most of those persons whom the King had convened as aforesaid, have formed a close Conspiracy against him, and to cut their way short, resolved to seize his Person; and that my Lord C—being pitched upon to exe∣cute the Design, he dexterously engaged the King to go to view the Vanguard of his Army, which was that part of it which was posted nearest the Enemy; That the King was ready to take Coach and ride thither, when his Nose falling to bleed on a sudden, obliged him to stay for that time, and put off the review till another opportunity; But before that day was over, he had good Information given him, that there was a Design formed to seize him, and that measures were concerted to have him car∣ried away to Exeter; and that my Lord C—upon that, with some others, withdrew to the Prince of Orange, as did the King to London. I would not have troubled your Lordship at this time, but that I know you expect I should give you the Sentiments of this side upon our affairs, and what part they take therein: Which with my humblest Duty to your Honour, is all I have at present to impart to you, who am, My Lord, Yours to serve and obey. Paris, Dec. 4. 1688. N. S.
LETTER LI. Of the Queen and Prince of Wales's going over into France. My Lord, THE King's Affairs are looked upon here to be lost beyond all human relief, and the Prince of Orange is now as much dreaded, as they heretofore made a semblance of despising and neglecting of him; tho, in reality, there were ever since I have known this place, se∣cret Fears of his great Constancy, Policy and Courage hanging upon this Court, and all the Hopes they have now left, and the only Twig to hang by, is his Petite Highness, who after great difficulties is with his Mother arrived here, and of which some of their Attendance give a lamentable relation; That upon my Lord Dartmouth's refusal to let the young Gentleman cross the Seas, he was carried back to London, whither the King was also come from Salisbury, who with the Count de Lu∣zune, who presented himself at Court the st of the last Month, concerted measures for the escape of the Queen and her Son: Signior Riva an Italian, and one of the Queens Servants, and Monsieur de Labadie, another of the King's, Persons of approved Fidelity, were intrusted to provide all things necessary for their em∣barking, and for their Journey from White-Hall
to the place where the Ship lay: They say, it was not without very great danger of being stopped and discovered, that the Queen and the Child got out of the Court, at a time when every thing was suspected, and when the Infants crying might have been a means to have broken all the best measures in the World. They were put into a strange Disguise, and so made their escape by the way of unfrequen∣ted Stairs and Places, crost the River of Thames, and took the Road which leads from London to Gravesend, where Monsieur de La∣badie had stopped a Vessel for to transport them into France; and all the while the Child did not as much as once cry: They were in danger several times of being seized by Senti∣nels, and a concourse of People, who suspected all whom they did not know, to be fugitive Papists, and looked upon their escape as a Prey that ran away from them. While they were on the Thames, they were encounter'd with Wind, Rain, the fluctuating of the Waves, in the horror of a Night so dark, that they could not see one another: The Queen on the other side of the River waited for a Coach, near the Walls of a Church, which was harnessed in a neighbouring Inn, being all the while expo∣sed to the Rain, which continued with great violence; But the Curiosity of a man who came out of the Inn with a Candle in his hand, put her into a great fear, lest she should be known, for the person advanced directly to∣wards the place where she stood, when Seignior Riva, who perceived him, immediately follow∣ed and encountered him briskly, so as that both of them fell into the Dirt, by which Di∣sion the Queen escaped undiscovered, and
the man thinking that what befel him was the ef∣fect of Chance, they both began to excuse the matter, which proceeded no further. When the Coach was got ready they rid away with all speed, and came to the Ship, where Labady's Wife (who had some Acquaintance with the Captain) appearing first, did so amuse him with a Story, That the Queen was an Italian Lady, returning with her Family into her own Country, till the Queen was got safe on Board, and lodg∣ed in the Cabin appointed for her, together with the Nurse that carried the Infant; The Marquess and Marchioness of Powis, the Counts of Dalmon and Montecuculli with o∣ther Persons of her Retinue, did imbark at the same time with the Irish Captains, sent on pur∣pose by the King to have an Eye over the Com∣mander of the Vessel, in case they found him any way refractory and deficient in his Duty; But of this, they say, there happened to be no occasion, for the Ship being under sail, they had an easie Passage, and landed at Calais on the 11th of this instant: She designed to have staid there for the King her Husband, who, ac∣cording as they had concerted Matters between them before their parting, was to follow her the next Day, but not finding the King come, she went for Bologn, where two Friers, and an an Officer that have made their Escape out of England, informed her of the Misfortune which befel her Husband at Feversham, and which your Lordship can tell much better than I. From Bologn she journey'd to Montrevil and from thence to S. Germains; where she and her Son have had honourable Reception of the King, and where King James is hourly expected. This, my Lord, is the Relation they give here of their
Flight, and dangerous Escape, which they count little less than a Miracle, and a pre∣serving both of the Queen and her Son to a much better Fortune. But tho' this Court put a ve∣ry good Meen upon the Matter, and talk high, yet it is at the same time very discernable that they are not a little mortified at the strangeness of the Prince of Orange's Success, and the sud∣denness of the Revolution. Which, with my humble Respects, is all I have to communicate at this Time, who am, My Lord, Your Lordships most devoted Servant. Paris, Jan. 2. 1689. N. S. POST-SCRIPT. My Lord, just as I am a closing of this Let∣ter, I am informed the King is also arrived at S. Germains, and has met with no less Honours from King Lewis than if he were possessed of his Dominions and subjects Affections, in as am∣ple a degree as ever he has or could be. My Lord, I am, &c.
LETTER LII. Of the Prince of Orange's Arrival at London My Lord, THis Place is very barren of News, tho' there is something, I am satisfied, a brewing, which will appear in Time, and all that is novel and extraordinary seems to have been tranplanted to the Brittish I sles from whence we hear, That the Prince of Orange, who, they say, is always intent, and ever was to improve favour∣able Conjunctures, hath taken Advantage of these Movements to make his Entry into Lon∣don, where 'tis confest, but with much Regret, he hath been received with great Demonstrati∣ons of Joy and publick Applause (but they say it is nothing but what is usually done to New∣comers) having been felicitated upon the Suc∣cess of his Enterprise, and thanked for the Zeal which he had testified for the good of the En∣glish Nation. 'Tis also reported, That the No∣bility have met together, and pray'd him to take the Administration of the Government upon him, till the Estates of the Kingdom can be called together, which is dreaded here by both Courts: I can assure your Lordship,
there have been Instructions issued out from hence already to their Agents at London (where they have a great Number, tho' un∣der various Disguises) for to countermine what ever Projects may be on foot for the esta∣blishing a Settlement in England, and of which I shall endeavour to transmit to your Lorship the Particulars. I am, My Lord, Your very humble Servant Paris, Jan. 27. 1689. S. N.
LETTER LIII. Instructions given to the French Emissaries, to infuse into some English Peers upon the subject-Matter of King James's Deserting of the Crown, in Favour of his Inter∣est. My Lord, ITs not doubted here but that there will be strong Efforts made for the Advancing of the Prince of Orange to the English Throne, and by the Returns made of Members to serve upon the present Occasion in the Lower House, it is concluded that their Procedures will be much in favour of his Interest, and consequently to the Disadvantage of this Court, and therefore they have taken care to give them a Bone to pick, tho' I know not well what it is for the present; But of the House of Lords they have entertained a more favourable Opinion; but foreseeing that whatever is agitated among the Commons is also likely to creep into a De∣bate among the Lords, and that the King's Re∣sigion, his Evil Administration, his Retreat out of the Kingdom, and the Compact between him and his People may be called in question; They have by way of Precaution given Instru∣ctions to their Emissaries slily to infuse into
any such Peers as they judge susceptible of such Insinuations (but I cannot think your Lordship of that Number) That it was true, the King's Religion had been a very main Cause to bring those Misfortunes upon himself and the Nation which they laboured under, but hereby it could not be thought that should be as much as once debated for a sufficient Ground to exclude him from his Throne; That this would appear strange in the Sight of all Nations, that a Po∣pish Prince was incapable to sway a Scepter, when even in England it self there had been no less than Forty Roman Catholick Kings, who had governed England, from King Egbert to Queen Elizabeth; That it was but the other Day that all the Kingdom had by Addresses on purpose disavowed that Maxime; That the two Universities had condemned the same for an Error, and that the Parliament in One thousand six hundred and eighty five, did believe it to be a thing so pernicious and destructive to a State, that they were minded to brand with Infamy all those who would have excluded the Duke of York from the Succession; That all the Nation having acknowledged this Prince at a Time when he made open Profession of the Popish Re∣ligion, it would be a ridiculous inconsequence to pretend that that same Religion was an Hin∣drance to his reigning as King of England; and that as for any previous Compact that might be alledged by ill disposed Men to have been between King and People, i was a pernicious chimerical Notion, often condemned as a Gap opened to seditious Practices for the imbroiling of the State; That surely that Retreat could not be called a Desertion in the King, full of Discontent, and finding himself abandoned
by his Subjects to the Mercy of a Foreign Na∣tion, especially seeing the Royal Character the bore, did but expose him to the Insults of the People, and his Person into the Hands of a Prince that imposed Laws upon him, seized him in his own Dominions, and gave him Um∣brages that ought to presage greater Dangers un∣to him; That the Offers he had again and again made to the Nation, and even to the Prince of Orange, who protected it, to treat with them amicably, to leave nothing undone for the re∣dressing of their Grievances, could not but be adjudged Reparations sufficient for those Faults that were imputed to him; That the Letter he had writ, left behind him at Feversham, and ordered to be printed, with several other Let∣ters which he had actually writ to diverse Per∣sons, asserting his Authority and Claim; And that the Protestations, which no doubt he would make against any Acts of the Assembly to meet, if any such should happen in disfavour of him, which could hardly be credited, and the Mea∣sures which he had taken, and whereof they heard enough every Day, and would doubtless more and more dayly, for the Recovery of his Dominions, were evident Demonstrations that he had not renounced them; And that if they were deserted by him, it was because his Person was in no Security there, and not the Throne, which he still looked upon as a Property apper∣taining to him alone; That he was not the first and only King, even of England, that had made this Step; That Ethelrede in the Time of the Saxon Kings retired into Normandy, and that among the Royal Stem of the Plantagenets, Ed∣ward IV. past over into Flanders without King Henry VI. his Competiter his believing that he
had thereby acquired a new Title to the Crown; That as to the present conjuncture the King found himself in, the Condition of Kings would be very hard, if they of all Mankind were the only Persons who were not allowed the Favour to shun a Danger they were exposed to, and which could not be avoided but by fleeing from it, and that surely it was a Man's Prudence when he saw his House on Fire beyond a possibi∣lity of extinguishing it, to save his own Life, and attend an Opportunity to rebuild it again, since he could not save it from burning. What Successes, my Lord, these Remonstrances have met with, or may still, it may be your Lord∣ship can tell; But I can tell you, if this fails, there is another Mine to spring, whereon they rely very much, and on which they intend to work with utmost Diligence; but I pray God to keep my poor Country from falling again into their Shares, from which it now is in so fair a way of being delivered, and to inspire your Lordship and other worthy Patriots sit such a juncture with a proportionable Zeal for the good of it, and so I rest. My Lord, Your Lordship's most Humble Servant. Paris, Feb. 5. 1689. S. N.
LETTER LIV. Upon the Throne's being declared Vacant by the Convention, the French Emissaries were to endeavour to embroil the Nation about the Form of Government to be established among them. My Lord, I Know not how it is in England, but Men's Wits here have plaid so liberally upon the Word Abdication, started in your Convention, and such Railery and Butle made about it as can scarce be believed by any without he were an Eye and Ear-Witness of it; and believing at the same time they would never make any thing of it but that the Precautions they had taken to man∣nage the Upper House, would fully answer their Expectations, the Grimaces they have since made upon their receiving certain Advices, That the Throne has been declared Vacant, are not so surprizing, for one is a natural Conse∣quence of the other, as they are sudden and ri∣diculous; Tho' they are not yet quite out of Hopes, for their Emissaries have received previ∣ous Instructions, That in case their Remonstran∣ces to the Lords, as mentioned in my last, would not do, that then they should chiefly turn their Batteries upon the Members of the Lower
House, by infusing Notions into some of one sort of Government as the best, To others an∣other, to gain Time thereby; and concert mu∣tual Iealousies between the Parties, which would not fail of making the Prince weary of such endless Wranglings, and so make him either assume the Government by vertue of his own Power and Authority; Or else seeing no Hopes of any Settlement, and that the Facti∣ons were so strong as not to be quelled, and so obstinate as not to be reconciled, to retire home, and leave them in a far worse State than he found them. The Republican Party, which they knew to be but very few, They are to ply warmly with the Fitness of the Opportunity to set up a Free State once again, that perhaps the Prince of Orange would be better pleased with it, provided he were made Stadtholder as he was in Holland, and great∣ly promote it, if he saw once a tendency in any considerable Members that way; that a Regency which was like to be proposed upon the declaring the Throne Vacant, could not be thought to be so agreeable to him; who knew well enough the publick Evils that were an∣next to such an Office, but that if it should so happen that the major part should carry it, that the Regal Dignity and Office should be continued and that in the Person of another than King James, and that by natural Con∣sequence it must be offered to the Prince of Orange, yet surely they could not be so far wanting to themselves as not to stickle that he might receive the Crown under such a Title as might come as nigh that Form of a Repub∣lick as might be, and lay a sure Foundation for the Introduction of it, when things were
riper, at another Turn of Government, which under such Circumstances could not chuse but quickly happen; And what could they better do, than to get the Kingdom declared Elective, which as it was a Debasing and Diminution of Hereditary Succession, so it was a great Step towards the erecting of a Popular Government once more, which the Treachery and Hypocri∣sie of one at the Head of it had destroyed in the present Age, when it was in a fair way of giving Laws to all the Neighbour Nations round it. They have been further instructed, That if they found any disposed to favour the Title of Conquest, so far to promote it as might in some Measure give Check to the o∣ther Factions, but by no means to overballance them. But that these Practices may have as little Success as those mentioned in my last to your Lordship, is the earnest Desire and Hope of, My Lord, Yours Lordship's most humble Servant. Paris, Feb. 15. 1689. N. S.
LETTER LV. Of the Prince and Princess of Orange being Proclaimed King and Queen of Eng∣land, &c. My Lord, THis Court is Thunder-struck that all their Counter-Plots and Designs have been ren∣dred so ineffectual in England, where hereto∣fore they seldom used to miss their Mark, and that they come to be assured by repeated Advices that the Prince and Princess of Orange are de∣clared King and Queen of England, &c. and what adds greatly to the Mortification is, the Circumstances of it, both as to the Title whereby they are declared and the People of England's previous aerting their Native Rights and Legal Privileges so vigorously and thereby casting such an Odium upon the late Government, as can hardly be obliterat∣ed and forgotten in this Age; And now they begin to think what may not they fear from a Prince who has been so much injured by them, had always the Honesty, as well as Courage and Constancy to oppose their In∣croachments; and now by this mighty Ac∣ssion of Power has means enough to put a
Check upon their exorbitant Greatness, and perhaps force them to disgorge what they have been devouring of their Neighbours for many Years past; which I heartily long to see effected, and wish King William and his Royal Consort may be happier than Augu∣stus and better than Trajanus, and that your Lordship may flourish under them, whom I shall ever loue and Honour, tho' I cannot at present serve, because of the Difficulty of Safe Conveyance to your Hands; and there∣fore till I can settle a sure and safe Corre∣spondence, upon this Change of Government, with your Lordship, I remain, My Lord, Your very humble Servant. Paris, Feb. 27. 1689. N. S. FINIS.
