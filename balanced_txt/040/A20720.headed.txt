AN ABSTRACT OF THE DVTIES COM∣MANDED, AND SINNES forbidden in the Law of God. BY THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, GEORGE DOVVNAME, Doctor of Diuinity, and Lord Bishop of DERRY. PSALM. 119. 96.I haue seene an end of all perfection: but thy Com∣mandement is exceeding broad. AT LONDON, Imprinted by FELIX KYNGSTON. 1620.
TO THE TRVE LOVER OF VERTVE AND RELIGI∣on, Mistris MARGARET HARE, widow, the late deare and louing wife of IOHN HARE Esquire, of the Inner Temple, and chiefe Clerke of his Maiesties Court of Wards and Liueries. THe Reuerend Author of this Booke, hauing now full twen∣ty yeeres since, in his publike exercises finished a very large Treatise vpon the Decalogue, or ten Commandements of Almighty God, was then pleased at my ear∣nest entreaty, and for my priuate vse, to collect and gather out of that large Treatise, the summe and heads of what was therein more largely handled, which I purposed still, accor∣ding to his first intent, to haue kept by me for my priuate vse: but since, hauing been often im∣portuned by many learned and religious Mini∣sters
for the loane thereof, whereto I had almost yeelded, had I not considered the wrong and iniurie which thereby might redound to the Author, if the same should happen to be printed, either by some vnperfect copy, or vnder the name of some other, especially, if euer the Au∣thor should be pleased to publish those his larger volumes. And therefore for satisfaction of the request of my friends, I endeuoured to gaine the Authors consent to the publishing heereof; which hauing obtained, I have now put the same in print for the publike and generall good, and doe dedicate the same vnto you, not onely to be a helpe to you in your priuate meditations in the Law of God, but also as a testimony of my thankfulnesse for your many fauours both to me and mine. The Almighty God make it profi∣table for the end intended: to whose blessed protection I commend you, and will euer rest Yours in all Christian duty to bee commanded, BASILL NICOLL.
THE PREFACE, CONTAINING RVLES OF direction, for the expounding of the Commandements. WHereas the holy Ghost testifi∣eth, that the Law of God,Psal. 19. 7. (though propounded in ten words) is so perfect, that no∣thing may be added to it, and so large, that nothing may bee compared therewith:Ps. 119. 96. It must therefore bee confes∣sed, that the sence of the Commandements is so to be inlarged, as that they may be vn∣derstood to bee the perfect Pandects (as it were) of Christians; forbidding all vices which the Lord condemneth in his Word; and commanding all morall duties which he requireth at our hands. And for as much as there are two prin∣cipall vses of the Law; the one, to shew vs our manifold sinnes, and the punishments due for them, that being humbled in our
selues, we might seeke to Christ: the other, that it might be a perfect rule, whereby to frame our liues and conuersation; that be∣ing redeemed by Christ, wee may also bee renewed according to the image of God, in true righteousnesse and holinesse: there∣fore it is very expedient, that the speciall duties commanded, and vices forbidden in euery Commandement, should particular∣ly be laid forth. That in respect of the for∣mer vse, we might see those manifold both duties which wee haue omitted, and also vices which wee haue committed hereto∣fore: and in respect of the latter, that wee might distinctly see and vnderstand those particular duties which the Lord enioy∣neth vs to obserue, and those particular vi∣ces which he chargeth vs to shunne for the time to come. And for our direction in this behalfe, we are to expound euery Commandement ac∣cording to these fiue rules: 1. Where any duty is commanded, there the contrary vice is forbidden; and where any vice is forbidden, there the con∣trary duty is commanded.
Euery Commandement therefore containeth two parts; the Affirmatiue, cō∣manding the duty. Negatiue, for∣bidding y• vice. Whence ariseth a di∣stinction of sins, that they are either sins of Omission. Commission. 2. Vnder one particular vice mentioned in the Commandement, all of the same kind are forbidden; and vnder one particu∣lar commanded, all of the same kind are commanded. For the Law of God is spiri∣tuall,Rom. 7. 14 and therefore requireth not onely outward obedience in word and deed, but also inward in the mind and heart. Neither doth it onely forbid the outward sinnes committed in word and deed, but also all the secret corruptions of the mind and heart. And thus our Sauiour hath taught vs to expound the Law of God, Math. 5. 21, 22, 27, 28. and 1. Epist. Ioh. 3. 15. Againe, the Law of God is perfect, re∣quiring perfect obedience both inward and outward, not onely in respect of the parts, but also of the degrees. Wherefore, where any duty is commanded, there the highest
degree of it is commanded, as appeareth by the summe of the Law, Math. 22. 37, 38. and where any vice is forbidden, there the least degree of it is forbidden, and beareth the name of that grosse sinne which is spe∣cified, that we might learne to esteeme no sinne small.1. Sam. 15. 23. For vnaduised anger is mur∣ther; and looking vpon a woman to lust after her, is forbidden vnder the name of adultery, as our Sauiour teacheth, Math. 5. 22, 28. 3. Where any duty is commanded, there the meanes which tend thereto are enioyned; and where any vice is forbidden, there the meanes, prouocations and allure∣ments tending thereto are also forbidden. For such as is the end, such are the subor∣dinate meanes that in their owne nature doe tend thereto. This teacheth, that good intentions and desires will not serue, when we are carelesse of the meanes. Now there are three meanes which are common to all duties, and therefore in all the Precepts are commanded; and the neg∣lect of them, or the vse of the contrary for∣bidden: viz. 1. Prayer: for of our selues wee cannot so much as thinke a good thought, 2. Cor. 3. 5. Psal. 119. 33, 34, 35, 36.
2. Diligent hearing of the Word, Rom. 10. 14, 17. 3. Good company, Prou. 13. 20. Hee that toucheth pitch, shall be defiled, Ecclus. 13. 1. A little leauen sowreth the whole lumpe, 1. Cor. 5. 6. Therefore Dauid bid∣deth the wicked depart from him, that hee might keepe the Commandements of his God, Psal. 119. 115. and else-where profes∣seth, that he auoided their company, Psalm. 26. 4, 5. 4. Where any duty is commanded, or vice forbidden, there also the signes are commanded, or forbidden. For first, as touching vertues and duties; the graces of God are not to bee smothered, as it were candles vnder a bushell, but they must be manifested to the glory of God, to the good example of others; and for a testimo∣ny to our selues that wee are endued with them, wee must bee carefull of honest things, not onely before God, but also be∣fore men, 2. Cor. 8. 21. And as touching vices, we are taught to abstaine from all shew of euill, 1. Thes. 5. 22. Haughty lookes, strange apparell, are con∣demned as signes of pride: haunting of sus∣pected places,Pro. 6. 17. Zeph. 1. 8. as signes of incōtinency, &c.
5. Duties to be procured, and vices to be auoided, not in our selues onely, but also in others. First therefore in all the Precepts is commanded the communion of Saints to be exercised among the faithfull, in an earnest desire shewne,Mat. 18. 15. to win our neigh∣bour vnto Christ, and in a tender care ta∣ken, for the furthering of the saluation one of another, by the duties of edification. As namely,Heb. 3. 13. 1. In respect of duties, by stirring vp one another,1. Thes. 5. 11, 14. Heb. 10. 24. by Instructing the igno∣rant.Dan. 12. 3. Admonitiō,Rom. 15. 14. or putting our brother in mind of his duty. Exhortation vnto his duty. Encouraging him in well-doing. Comforting those which are weake. Good Counsell. Example. Math. 5. 16. 1. Pet. 2. 12. Heb. 12. 13
2. In respect of things for∣bidden, to Reclame the Erroneous. Iam. 5. 19, 20. Reprooue the offendour. Leu. 19. 17. Eph. 5. 11. Disswade from vice. Secondly, in all the Precepts wee are forbidden to haue any fellowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darknesse, Eph. 5. 11. or to be accessary to the offences of others, 1. Tim. 5. 22.
Men may be accessary to the offences of o∣thers, diuers wayes: whereof some are Common, and those either Going before the offence committed, as Prouoca∣tion, by Incensing, Gal. 5. 26. Eph. 6. 4. Iob 2. 9. 1. King. 21. 25, 7. Alluring. Pro. 1. 10. 7. 18, 21. and here∣to corrupt and infecting speeches are referred. 1. Cor. 15. 33. Euill counsell: 2. Sam. 13. 5. 16. 21. 2. Chr. 22. 3, 4.

Act. 7. 58. so recei∣uers, of theft; bawds, of adultery; partners of the gaine. Pro. 1. 14. Psal. 50. 18. Couert, as by silence, or dissembling the fault of our brother, when hee ought to be admonished: for as by ill speech thou bringest thy brother into sinne, so by ill silence thou lea∣uest him in sinne, or sufferest sinne to rest vpon him, Leuit. 19. 17. Qui tacet, consentire videtur. Euill ex∣ample, oc∣casioning another to fall: this is called a scandall, Ro. 14. 13. and it is either a scandall In it selfe as that which is euill in it selfe, and is therefore an offence gi∣uen, though it be not taken: as any sinne committed in the sight or no∣tice of another. By accident, when the thing, which in it selfe is indifferent, is so vsed, as that the weake brother is offended thereby: that is, when he is by thine example animated to do that, which in his owne conscience he doth cō∣demne. Ro. 14. 20, 22. 1. Cor. 8. 9, 10. Accompanying, or following after the offence, as ye Excusing Defending Cōmending of it. Esa. 5. 20. Prou. 24. 24. Peculiar to Superi∣ours, as to Command that which is euill & vnlawful, either Publikely, by wicked laws & edicts. Esa. 10. 1. Dan. 3. 4, 5. 6 Priuately. 1. Sam. 22. 18. 19. 2. Sā. 12. 9. & 2.

The Law is diuided into two Tables, the One, commanding the loue of God, or the duties of Piety towards God. Mat. 22. 37, 38. Other, cōmanding the loue of our neigh∣bour, or the duties of charity and righ∣teousnesse towards our neighbour, Mat. 22. 39. The Commande∣ments of the first Table, prescribing the worship of God, or Piety, teach Who is to bee worshipped: viz. that Iehouah alone is to bee had and worshipped as God. Praec. 1. How, both in His solemne worship: viz. by such means, and after such a manner as he hath prescribed. Praec. 2 The whole course of our liues, viz. by sanctifying & glo∣rifying his name. Praec. 3. When especially God is to bee wor∣shipped, viz. on the Sabbath, which is to be sanctified, and con∣secrated to the worship and ser∣uice of God. Praec. 4.
The first Commandement. The Summe of the first Commandement. Math. 4. 10. Thou shalt haue Iehouah alone for thy God. The Affirmatiue part, Containing two branches. 1. That we should haue Iehouah to our God. 2. That we should haue him alone. The speciall duties. We are to haue God both Inwardly in our Minds, by Knowing Beleeuing Remēbring him. Hearts, by adhering vnto him. Outwardly, and in the whole man, by ho∣nouring him. In our minds.The duties of the mide. 1. The true KnowledgeKnowledge of God. Ioh. 17. 3. Where we are to consider the Obiect: the truth which God hath reuealed concerning himselfe. Deut. 29. 29. Ioh. 5. 39. 1. Tim. 2. 4. Quantity or measure, 1. Cor. 14. 20. Col. 3. 16. which must bee proportionable to our Calling, more being required in those who are guides of others. Meanes. Luk. 12. 48. Time which God hath vouchsafed vs. Heb. 5. 12. Quality, that it bee an effectuall▪ powerfull, and spirituall knowledge. 1. Ioh. 2. 3, 4.
The Negatiue part. Forbidding, 1. The not hauing of God, which is Atheisme. 2. The hauing of a false god, which is Idolatry. 3. The hauing of more gods than one, which is Po∣lytheisme. The Opposite vices. Opposite to know∣ledge, in regard of the Obiect, both in the Excesse: curiosity, to bee we aboue that which is written. 1. Cor. 4. 6. Desect, Ignorance 1. Cor. 15. 34. Hos. 4. 1, 6. either when men Cannot, through their naturall corruptin. 1. Cor. 2. 14. Rom. 3. 11. and this is na∣rurall blindnesse. Will not, which is af∣fected ignorance. 2. Pet. 3. 5. Care not to know God. which is e∣lesse ignorance. Pro. 1. 22. Ioh 3. 19. The fruit of ignorance, which is, errours concerning God. Math. 22. 29. Quantity, a small measure of knowledge. Heb. 5. 12.

2. Faith,Faith. whereby we giue credit to the Word of God. 1. Ioh. 5. 10. Faith, in respect of the obiect, is either Generall, whereby wee giue assent to the whole Word of God. And this, in regard of the Quantity, ought to be a ful per∣swasion, in re∣spect both of Vnderstan∣ding. Col. 2. 2 Assent. Luk. 1. 1. Quality, must bee a liuely, effe∣ctuall and working Faith. Iam. 2. 18. Gal. 5. 6. Speciall, giuing cre∣dit to the Threatnings of the Law to our humiliation. 2. Chron. 34. 19, 21, 27, Io. 3. 5. Promises of the Gospell to our iustification. Ioh. 3. 16. 3. RemembranceRemem∣brance. of God. Eccl. 12. 1. Esa. 62. 6.

Luk. 8. 15. Recordation, recording or recalling to mind that which was committed to memory. Psal. 78. 34, 35. Psal. 22. 27. And this ought to bee Effectuall, working obedience. Psal. 119. 55.

Opposed to Faith Generall, in the Excesse, vaine credulity, hauing no ground in the Word of God. Defect, in respect of the Parts, viz. Vnderstanding, such especially is the implicite faith of Pa∣pists. Assent, With-held from the truth, doubting. Rom. 4. 20. Math. 21. 21. Giuen to the contrary, fals∣hood. 2. Kin. 7. 2. 2. Th. 2. 11, 12. which are two degrees of infidelity. Quantity, , a small measure of faith. Act. 26. 28. Quality, the idle and dead faith. Iam. 2. 14, 17, 26. Speciall, viz.

Iustice alone, to Desperation.
In our hearts we are to adhere vnto the Lord,The duties of the mind and set our hearts vpon him alone. Deut. 13. 4. Act. 11. 23. 1. Cor. 7. 35. Ioh. 23. 8. This is to be done by setting our affections vpon God, chiefly by Trusting in Louing Fearing him aboue althings and frō these three some others arise. 1. Trust or assiance,Affice in God. in God. Pro. 3. 5. Psal. 32. 10.34. 8. Which we are to haue, whe∣ther wee Haue meanes, for wee are not to trust in them, but in the vse of them to de∣pend vpon God. Psa. 44. 5, 6, 7.60. 11. Want meanes. Iob 13. 15. Wee are to trust in God, who is able to prouide for vs, both Without meanes, Genes. 22. 14. Euen in the Mount will God prouide. aboue means. 2. Chr. 20. 12. 14. 11. 1. Sam. 14. 6.
Opp. Remo∣uing our harts from God, Ier. 17. 5. either by Not setting our hearts vpon God▪ the fault of Hypocrites. Esa. 29. 13 Profane persons. Ierem. 12. 2. Setting our hearts vpon other things, the fault of worldlings. Psal. 62. 10. Phil. 3. 19. who are therefore called Adul∣terers. Iam. 4. 4. Oppos. as Extremes, in the Excesse: tempting of God, Math. 4. 6. Defect, diffi∣dence, Luk. 12. 29. and the fruits therof, viz. Carking care. Mat. 6. 25, 31. Luk. 21. 34. Vse of vnlawful means.

To Affiance we are to ioyne Hope:Hope. for he that trusteth to Gods goodnesse for the present, will also expect god things from him for the time to come. Psal. 37. 7. Psal. 146. 5. Heb. 6. 19. Her 2. things are to be considered, the Obiect, both the Person, in whom, viz. God alone: who there∣fore is called our Hope. Psal. 46. 262. 9. Ioel 3. 16. Col. 1. 27. 1. Tim. 1. 1. Things, viz. good things to come, ac∣cording to Gods pro∣mise, both in This life, as Assistance in time of need. Psalm. 46. 1.62. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. Exhibition of all good things. Psalm. 104. 27, 28. World to come, eternall life. Tit. 1. 2. 1. Thes. 5. 8. which, be∣cause it is the chiefe obiect of our hope, is also called our hope. Col. 1. 5. Tit. 2. 13. Manner how wee are to hope, with Patience. Rom. 8. 25. 1. Thes. 1. 3. Hab. 2. 3. Assurance and comfort. Rom. 12. 12. Heb. 3. 6. 6. 11. 1. Pet. 1. 13.
Opp. as Extremes, in the Excesse: Presumption, as the hope of the hypo∣crite and impenitent sinner: for true hope is ioyned with repentance. 1. Ioh. 3. 3. and ne∣uer maketh ashamed. Rom. 5. 5. but this doth. Iob 8. 13. Prou. 11. 7. Defect, Absence of hope, as in the ignorant. Eph. 2. 12. 1. Thes. 4. 13. Despera∣tion, or casting off of hope, as in Epicures, who as they haue cast off all sorrow, Eph. 3. 19 so also all hope. 1. Cor. 15. 32. Esa. 22. 13. Ier. 18. 12. Mē ouer∣whelmed with sor∣row. 2. Cor. 2. 7. arising from the sence of their Affliction. Gen. 4. 13. 2. Cor. 7. 10. who therfore som times make away themselues. Sinnes, and is either Tēporary and cura∣ble, as in the Elect. Finall and incurable. Mat. 27. 5 Act. 1. 18. Disorder or of hope, being placed in Our selues, or in our owne merits. Any other thing besides God, from which (as the Author) wee ex∣pect good things, ei∣ther in This life, ac∣cording to that which was said in the disorder of affiance. The world to come.
2. LoueLoue. of God. Psal. 31. 23. 1. Ioh. 4. 19. Math. 22. 37. Where consider the Measure both Simply: for hee is to bee loued without measure, as hee is good without measure, and hath loued vs without mea∣sure. Ephes. 3. 19. Ioh. 3. 16. but because wee cannot at∣taine to that; yet let vs loue him with all our heart. Deut. 6. 5. or at the least, with an vpright heart. By comparison: for as hee is in∣finitely good aboue al things, so he ought to be loued aboue all things. Luk. 14. 26. Math. 10. 37. Manner: for as hee is absolutely good, yea goodnesse and charity it selfe; so hee is to be loued absolutely and for himselfe; but all other things in him, and for him. As for example: we are to loue our Friends, in the Lord. Foes, for the Lord. Vnto the loue of God, arising from the perswasion of Gods loue towards vs, wee are to ad∣ioyne partly as fruits, partly as companions thereof: Zeale of Gods glory. Reioycing in God. Thankfulnes towards God. Obedience towards God. Patience towards God.
Oppos. as Extremes, in the defect, (for in the excesse we cannot of∣fend) Want of the loue of Gd, when wee doe not loue him, either With all our hearts. Aboue all things. Hatred of God, which is partly Natural. Rom. 8. 7 Encreased by sin. Rom. 1. 30. Disorder, when we loe any things as much, or more than God, Mat. 10 37. 1. Sam. 2. 29. 1. Kin. 11. 3. heereof there are two principall sorts, viz. the loue of Our selues; I meane not the naturall loue of our selues, whereby we seeke our preservation (which as it is subrdinate to the loue of God, is lawfull) nor the spirituall loue of ourelues, whereby wee seeke our saluation; but the carnall loue of our selues, 2. Tim. 3. 12. Rom. 1. 14. Gal. 6. 8. The world, & of those things that are therein, 1. Ioh. 2. 15, 16. as the loue of Pleasure, wch is voluptu∣ousnesse. 2. Tim. 3. 4. Philip 3. 19. 2. Pet. 2. 10, 12. Riches, wch is couetous∣nesse. Col. 3. 5. Eph. 5. 3. Honour and glory, which is ambition, and vaie∣glory. Gal. 5. 26.
ZealeZeale. of Gods glory. 1. King. 19. 10. Apo 3. 19. Here we are to consider, Wherein this zeale must shewit selfe. How it ought to be qualified. It must shew it selfe in re∣gard of the Meanes of Gods glo∣ry: and in this re∣spect it cōtaineth 2. duties: viz. a Feruent desire and forward care, y• the means of ad∣uancing Gods glory, may bee vsed both by Thēselues, Tit 2. 14 3. 8. Rom. 12. 11. Act. 18. 25. Others. 2. Cor. 11. 2. Col. 4. 13. Hebr. 10. 24. Willing and cheerfull vsing of the meanes, and doing of the things whereby God may be glorified. 1. Chron. 28. 9. 1. Ioh. 5. 3. Ioh. 4. 34. Psalm. 122. 1. Esa. 58. 13. Act. 17. 11. 2 Cor. 9. 7. Impediments of Gods glory, in respect wher∣of it is a compound affection of feruent loue and desire of promoting Gods glory, and a vehement indignation conceiued a∣gainst the obstacles therof. 1. King. 19. 10. Ioh. 2. 17. Numb. 25. 11. 2. Pet. 2. 7. Psalm. 119. 136. This zeale ought to be Pure, Proceeding from a sincere affection not mixed with Malice and emula∣tion. Hypocrisie. Guided by knowledge, assuring the par∣ty of the goodnesse of the cause. Gal. 4. 18. Discreet, & therefore both Moderate, not exceeding the Proportion of the cause. Bounds of a mans calling. Seasonable. Prou. 25. 11.
Oppos. Want of zeale, whereof are two degrees: Lukewarmnesse. Apoc. 3. 15, 16. when men are neither hot nor cold, &c. Coldnesse and (as it were) deadnesse in Religion. Zeph. 1. 12. Corrupt zeale, be∣ing either Mixed with corrupt af∣fections to which it is pretended (and therefore not sincere but counterfait) as with Maliciousnes, which is bit∣ter zeale. Ia. 3. 14. Couetousnes, Ioh. 12. 5, 6. Ambition and vaine-glory, &c. 2. King. 10. 16, 29. Not guided by Knowledge, which is a blind zeale. Rom. 10. 2. Phil. 3. 6. Ioh. 16. 2. the which, the more feruent, the more surious it is. Act. 26. 1122. 23.

Wherein we are to follow the dire∣ction of Gods Word, viz. that wee vse Those Sacraments, and no other, which the Lord hath instituted in his Word. Them after that manner which God hath prescribed in his Word. The Sacraments of the New Testa∣ment (for the Old appertaine not to vs) are onely two, viz. Baptisme. The Lords Supper In the right vse of Baptisme, there are duties required in the Party bap∣tizing: in whom it is required, that he Be a lawfull Minister.

Opp. To depart.
1. Cor. 11. 23. In the right vse of the Lords Supper, there are duties required in The Minister, that he admi∣nister it accor∣ding to Christs institution: where con∣sider What hee is to administer, viz. The elements, both Bread. Wine. The Sacramentall Word. How, with such Sacramentall rites and acti∣ons as were ordained by Christ. To whom, to the faith∣full in profession at the least: And not to Profane persons. Heretikes, or excō∣municat persons, Such as cānot pre∣pare themselues. To what end, that it might be a Sacrifice of praise to God. Memoriall of Christs death. Meanes to confirme the faith of the receiuer, &c. The faithfull among the people, viz. to Receiue the Communion when it is administred. Receiue it worthily.

At the Com∣muniō some thing is to be Considered: the sacramentall v∣nion of the signe, and the thing signified. Done, viz. the bread & the wine are to bee recei∣ued with Faith. Thanksgiuing, & shewing orth the death of Christ. After∣wards, to Be thankfull to God. Labour to feele the fruit and benefit of the Sacrament. Performe y• repētance, wch in the time of our preparatiō we either purposed or promised.
The Papists with hold the Cup from the people. The Papists powre water into their wine. They mutter the words as a charme ouer the bread. They vse diuers gesticulations, partly Ridiculous. Idolatrous, as Eleuation. Adoration. Carrying about. the Bread. The Popish Priests distribute nothing to others, but are the onely receiuers in their priuate Masses. The Papists consecrate their Eucharist, that it may bee Adored and carried about in pompe, and not to be recei∣ued. A sacrifice propitiatory for the quicke and the dead. An Idoll which they worship in stead of Christ.
And these were the parts of Gods worship. Now follow the Aduncts of Gods worship, as the Circumstances. Ceremonies. Meanes thereof. Concerning the circumstances belonging to Gods worship, and the ceremonies therein to bee vsed, we are to follow the gene∣rall rules of Gods word, namely, that all things be done To edification. 1.

The Negatiue part, Forbidding to take the name of God in vaine; that is, to profane it, or pollute it.

After an especiall manner, according to any almost of the former acceptati∣ons, and that is, by swearing.
1. As the name of God signifieth▪ God himselfe, and his attributes. Thus wee are to san∣ctifie the name of God, in our Hearts, 1▪ Pet. 3. 14, 15. by Thinking and conceiuing of God and his attributes, holily and reuerently.

4. As the Name of God doth signifie his Word. This (to omit the holy and pure vse of it, in the preaching & hearing thereof, of which we spake in ye 2. Com.) we are to sanctifie in our Hearts, by a holy Meditation therof. Desire, study and care to know and practise it. Psal. 119. Words and writings, by applying it to those vses for which it is profitable. 2. Tim. 3. 16. to our selues, or o∣thers, for the Information of the iudgement, by do∣ctrine and confu∣tation.

This being the right way, Esa. 30. 21. Act. 9. 2. wee are to walke in it, Mic. 4. 5. and that Vprightly, in re∣spect of God. Psal. 119. 1. Gal. 2. 14. Gen. 17. 1. Inoffēsiuely, in re∣spect of men. 1. Cor. 10. 32. Heb. 12. 13. Phil. 1. 10. Act. 24. 14, 15, 16.
The Word of God is profaned in the Heart, when wee haue neither desire to know it, nor care to keepe it. Words & writings, when it is abused to vses either Vaine and vnprofitable, as when it is read in an vnknowne language, or so sung, that it cannot bee vnderstood. Psalm. 47. 7. Euill, in respect of Iudgement, as for the Confutation of the truth. Confirmation of er∣rours. Manners, as to Impenitency. Psa. 50. 16, 17. Scoffes and iests. Charmes and in∣chantments. Deut. 18. 11, 12. Deeds, when we doe not obserue it to doe it, Leuit. 22. 31, 32. either through Neglect. Malac. 1. 12. Amos 2. 7. Prou. 30. 9. Contempt, which is a kind of blasphemy. Num. 15. 30, 31. Thus y• name of God is takē in vaine, when our cōuersatiō is not agree∣able to our profession: as whē mē walke in respect of God, in hypo∣crisie, 2.

Sam. 12. 14. and those y• would seeme forward professors.
6. As the Name of God signifieth his workes, both of Creation, in respect whereof hee is called the Creator. Administration, in regard whereof hee is called the Gouernour and Iudge of the world. The workes of Creation or crea∣tures, we are to sanctifie by a Holy me∣ditation and men∣tioning of them, to Gods glo∣ry, that we In them may acknow∣ledge the wisedome, power and goodnesse of God. Rom. 1. 19, 20. Psalm. 19. 1. Knowing him by his workes, may glorifie him as God. Rom. 1. 21. Acknowledging in thē the workmanship of God, may speake ho∣nourably thereof. Psa. 139. 14. Gen. 1. 3 1. Our good, that what the Scripture hath taught vs in thē to Imitate, wee may follow. Math. 6. 26, 28. Prou. 6. 6. Auoide, wee may shun. Psalm. 32. 9. Ierem. 5. 8. 2. Pet. 2. 22. Pure vse, sanctified by The Word. Prayer. 1. Tim. 4. 5
Opp. In respect of Gods glory, Not to acknowledge God by his crea∣tures. Knowing him by them, not to glorifie him as God. To depraue or deride (like Mous) the workes of God. In regard of our good, to imitate that in them, which the Scriptures teach vs to shun. Opp. To the vse sanctified by the Word, is the vse Without, or besides the Word, being Scrupulous. Rom. 14. 23. Superstitious, Ascribing sanctifica∣tion to them, as, to holy-water, salt, candles, bells. Abusing them to di∣uination. Deut 18. 10. Esa. 47. 13. Ier. 10. 2. Contrary to the Word, abusing them as instruments vnto sinne, as our bo∣dies to fornication, our meate and drinke, to surfetting and drunken∣nesse. Prayer, the profane vse, without Crauing Gods blessing in the vse. Returning thanks to God the giuer of them.
The workes of administration, (which in a generall sence are called the iudgements of God) are exercised in Determining doubts, which by men cannot sufficiently be decided, viz. Lots, Prou 16. 33. as in Deciding contro∣uersies. Pro. 18. 18. Elections. 1. Sam. 10. 21, 24. Act. 1. 23. Diuiding inheri∣tances. Numb. 26. 55. Finding out a se∣cret offedor. Iosh. 7. 14. Lots are purely vsed, when we Call vpon God for his di∣rection, re∣ferring our selues to his iudgement. Act. 1. 24. Rest well plea∣sed in the sentence of God. Assigning Rewards and bles∣sings, hereof we are to haue a pure vse, whether bestowed vpon Our selues: that is, to bee thankfull for them, and to testifie our thākfulnes, by Words, in Giuing thankes. Psal. 124. 6. 86. 12, 13. Declaring Gods benefits. Ps. 66. 16. 71. 8, 18. Deed, by Referring thē to Gods glory, & the good of our brethren. Luk. 19. 13. Being mooued to re∣pentance thereby. Rom. 2. 4. Others: viz. to Reioyce with them. 1. Cor. 12. 26 Praise God for them. Psal. 35. 27. Gal. 1. 23. Punishments & crosses, wch more specially are called iudg∣ments: wherof also wee are to haue a pure vse, whether laid on Our selues, to Bee humbled vnder the hand of God. Iob 1. Patiently & thankfully to beare them Iob 1. To learne obedience by that we suffer. Heb. 5. 8. Others, to Be terrified (by their example) frō sinne. Iosh. 22. 20. 1. Cor. 10. 6. Rom. 11. 20, 21. Condole with y• faithful. Ro. 12. 15 Magnifie the iustice of God in pu∣nishing the wicked Psal. 58. 11, 12. Iudg. 5. 31.
Lots abused, in Casting of fortunes. The game called Lottery. Those games of Dice and Cards, &c. which wholly consist in chance: for in toyes and sports wee are not to ap∣peale to the immediate iudgement of God. Prou. 16. 33. Not to be thankfull to God for his benefits. Not to testifie our thankfulnesse: but rather to Assume the praise to our selues. Abuse Gods blessings to His dishonour. Harme of others. Impenitency. To enuie the graces of God in others. Not to be humbled vnder the hand of God. Ier. 5. 3. Esa. 22. 12, 13. To be impatient, and to murmure. To be incorrigible. Esa. 1. 5. Ier. 2. 30. Not to be warned by the iudgements of God vpon o∣thers. Dan. 5. 22. but rather to be pleased with our selues, that we are not so afflicted. Luk. 13. 1, 2, 3. To reioyce at the afflictions of others. Iob 31. 29.
Of Othes. 1. In generall. The Nae of God is to be sanctified by a lawfull Oth. Where consider two things: First, that we are to sweare vpon iust occasion. Deut. 6. 13. Psal. 63. 11. Esa. 45. 23. Secondly, that we sweare lawfully. Duties required in a lawfull Oth, respect the Object: for we are to sweare by the Lord alone, Esa. 65. 16. Ierem. 12. 6. Either Directly. Indirectly, the inuocation and at∣testatiō referred to God, though something else be named. Maner, for we are to sweare▪ Ier 4. 2. in Truth, Rom. 9. 1. that is, To that which is true. Truly, Exanimi sententia. 2. Chr. 15. 15. Righteousnesse, promising by Oth lawfull things onely. Iudgement, Discerning the necessity of our Oth, in respect of the Person Imposing it. Not beleeuing a necessa∣ry truth, without it. Thing, which cannot otherwise be proued. End, for Gods glory. The good of Our selues. Others. Duly weighing the conditions & circumstances. Gen. 24. 5. Iosh. 2. 17, 18, 19. End, for we are so to sweare, that God may haue glory by the manifestation, or con∣firmation of a necessary (but hidden) truth, which otherwise could not bee demonstrated▪ Iosh. 7. 19. Our neighbour may be satisfied, controuersies may be ended. Heb. 6. 16. Our owne innocency cleered, Exod. 22. 11. and ou duty discharged. 1. King. 8. 31.
To refuse altogether to sweare, with the Anabaptists. To sweare vnlawfully. To sweare by any thing be∣sides God, Ier. 5. 7. Zeph. 1. 5. vsing Othes Ridiculous: as By Lakin, &c. Pharisaicall, by creatures, as Light, Fire, &c. Popish, as by Saints: Mary, Iohn, &c. Idols, as Masse. Rood. Amos 8. 14. Heathenish, by the gods of the Gentiles, 1. King. 19. 2. Mebercle, Medius Fidius, &c. Blasphemous, as by all the parts and mem∣bers of Christ. Opp. to sweare To that which is false. Leuit. 19. 12. Falsly, with a mind to deceue Ps. 24. 4. To sweare to an vnlawfull thing, which either Is apparantly vnlawfull at the tie of the Oth. 1 Sam. 25. 21, 3.  28. 10. Afterwards proueth to bee vnlawfull. Mark. 6. 23, 25. Opp. To sweare Without necessity, as they vse to doe, who sweare ordinarily and com∣monly: this is to pllte the Name of God, and to make that common, which he hath sanctified and extol∣led aboue all things. Math. 5. 37. Iam. 5. 12. Ecclus. 23. 8. Rashly and vnaduisedly. Leuit. 5. 4. 1. Sam. 14 39, 44. as those which sweare in heat and choler. To sweare to No end, vainly, & through a foolish custome, without regard of Gods glory, or good of their brethren, or discharge of their duty. An ill end, as For a brauery, that they may glory in their shame, and garnish their speech with the pollution of Gods Name. To falsifie the truth, and to win cre∣dit to a falshood.
2. In speciall. There are two distinction of Othes. 1. An Oth is either Assertory, wherein some truth, is auouched, and that, if it bee Certaine & knowne, sim∣ply that it is so. Supposed, according to our opinion, that wee thinke so. Promissory, wherby we truly promise some lawfull thing which is in our power, cal∣ling vpon God not onely as our witnesse and Iudge, but also as our surety, that we will performe it. Heere foure things are required: 1. That the thing be lawfull. 2. That it is, and will be in our power. 3. That wee haue a true and vnfained purpose to per∣forme it. 4. That wee doe in∣deed performe it, Num. 30. 2. though to our owne hin∣derance. Psal. 15. 4. 2. An Oth is either Publike. Priuate.
Opp. To auouch that to bee True, which we know to be false. Certaine, which we know not to bee true. Opp. To promise by Oth y• which 1. Is not lawfull, which is to sinne with an high hand, and with a desperate resolution to doe ill. 2. Is not in our po∣wer, wch either Appeareth so at the first; and so cannot be promised by Oth, without extreme profanesse. Proueth so afterwards; & ther∣fore cannot be promised sim∣ply, without great rashnesse. 3. We doe not meane to performe: which is to sweare deceitfully. Psalm. 24. 4. 4. Which wee doe not performe, being a thing lawfull, and in our owne power; and this properly is called Periurie. But if it be Impossible, our Oth doth not bind vs. Vnlawfull, wee are bound to breake it: otherwise we adde sinne to a sinne.
In publike Othes cō∣sider the duty of him that Imposeth it, viz. that he so impose it, as that the Oth may bee taken in Truth. Iudgement. Righteousnes. Deposeth: that the consideratiō of the publike plae for seat of iudge∣ment, make him y• more reuerent∣ly and circumspectly performe the generall duties, both in Othes Asser∣tory. Promis¦sory. A priuate Oth may be taken onely vpon necessity. Mat. 5. 37. for what is redundant, aboue yea or nay, in our ordi∣nary talke or communication, is of euill: and consequent∣ly priuate Othes must be rare and in season. To Promissory Othes we are to referre Vowes, which are promissory Othes, made to God voluntarily concer∣ning the performance of some certaine thing which may be acceptable to God, either for the confirmation of our faith in prayer, or for the strengthening of our resolution in the performāce of some good thing which we purpose. Duties required in Vowes, belong either to the Making Performing of them. Psal. 76. 11. Esa. 19. 21. Those which belong to the making of a vow, concerne the Obiect, which is God alone, Psal. 76. 11. Manner. A. End. B.
Opp. To impose an Oth, When it is not necessary. Vpon men of no credit, who make no conscience of an Oth. In matters of no moment. Tumultuously and in haste. Iniuriously, especially in a capitall cause, to make the party accuse himselfe. Against his conscience, when hee knoweth that it Is false. Will not bee perfor∣med. Opp. To depose in an Oth Assertory, con∣trary to con∣science, for Malice. Fauour. Hire. 1. King 21. 13. Mark. 14. 56. Promissory, contrary to a mans purpose: as when being chosen to publike places, or admitted into societies, men take Othes, onely because it is the custome and man∣ner that they should sweare, not because they meane to keepe their Oth. To sweare in our communication, Without necessity, Rashly. Profanely. Ier. 23. 10. Ordinarily and commonly. The Pa∣pists vow to Saints, both Themselues: as to Augustine, Francis, Domi∣nick, &c. as the Nazarites were wont to vow themselues to God. Numb. 6. Other things; as Oblations, and Pilgrimages, &c.
A. Manner, for it must be made in Truth, and therfore must be Sincere. 2. Chron. 15. 15. Voluntary. Deut. 23. 23. Righte∣ousnesse, both in re∣spect of the Person vowing, that either hee Be his owne man. Haue the consent of his go∣uernour. Numb. 30. Thing vowed, that it be lawfull & accepta∣ble to God: as Things good and comman∣ded: of such, Vowes are made. Absolutely, wch are renewings of our Vow in Baptisme. With restraint of circumstan∣ces: as to giue so much almes weekly; or to pray so oft dai∣ly, &c. The vse, or forbearance of things indifferent, as wee haue found the same profitable or hurtfull to vs. Iudgement, so as the party cleerly discerne it to be a thing, 1. lawfull and acceptable vnto God: 2. in our power, ei∣ther naturally, or by the assistance of Gods grace promi∣sed to vs: 3. profitable. B. End of the Vow, which is, to confirme our Faith in prayer. 1. Sam. 1. 11. Resolution in good things. Thing vowed, which must be referred to the Glory of God, as Vowes Eucharisticall, sacrifices of praise, gifts to be bestowed to godly vses. Ps. 66. 13, 14.  61. 8.  132. 2, 5. Leuit 27. 16. Gen. 28. 20, 21. Good of our brethren: as Vowes of charity and mercy towards the poore. Our pro∣fit: as the Vowes of Sobriety, of fasting and abstinence. Repen∣tance, as of Hūbling our soules. Nu. 30. 14 Amen∣ding our liues, in Forsaking our sins with the occasi∣ons thereof. Stirring vp our selues to the per∣formance of our duties.
Opp. Vowes Hypocriticall: when men doe not truly purpose to performe them: such as hypocrites make in the time of aduersity, to deceiue God. Psal. 78. 36. Forced: as of some young persons, which against their will are thrust into Monasteries, and made to vow single life. The Vowes of children entring into a Monastery, a∣gainst the will of their parents, are held firme among Pa∣pists: as Mat. 15. 5, 6. Opp. To vow things either Simply euill. Euill to vs. Such are Monasticall Vowes. Opp. To vow that which ei∣ther is not, or wee know it not to be Lawfull and acceptable to God. Deut. 23. 18. as the Vow of voluntary pouerty. In our owne power: as the Vow of single life, in them that haue not the gift of con∣tinency. Profitable, as going on Pilgrimages, &c. Vowes therefore indefinitely conceiued, (as that of Iephthe, Iudg. 11. 31.) are vnlawfull, because we know not whether they will be lawfull, in our power, or profitable. Opp. To vow with the Pa∣pists, such things as serue nei∣ther for the Glory of God, but To superstitious and idolatrous ends. For their owne glory, with opini∣on of merit. Profit of their neighbour, but contrary thereto, as the Vow of Monastical obe∣dience, making them renounce all duty to pa∣rents, & seruice to their coun∣trey. Voluntary po∣uerty, making them drones, &c. Good of themselues, as y• Vow of continency, from whence all the vncleannesse & incon∣tinency of the Popish Clergy proceedeth.
As touching the performance of Vowes, the Scripture requireth that we should performe them, or else we commit a sinne, as bad, or worse than Periury, Num. 30. 3. & that without Delay. Eccles. 5. 3, 4. Deut. 23. 21. Diminution. Num. 30 3. Deut. 23. 23. Prouided alwayes, that the thing vowed bee Lawfull. In our po∣wer. Otherwise wee haue sinned in vowing, but wee are not bound to the performance. No hing doth bind the conscience, which is against the Word of God. Vowes are of 2. sorts: some Common to all Christians, as the Vow in Baptisme, whereby we consecrated our selues to God, and is more carefully to be performed. Proper to seuerall men, and it is ei∣ther a Renewing of the common Vow, which is needfull to bee done, when men come to yeeres of discretion. New Vow, concerning Certaine things comman∣ded, with limitation of circumstances. Things indifferent, to bee vsed or refused, as wee haue found them by experience to bee pro∣fitable or hurtfull for vs.
Not to performe lawfull Vowes, being in our power. To vse delay, which argueth vnwillingnesse. To performe it by the halues, which argueth doubling, as in Ananias and Saphyra. Act. 5. To thinke our selues bound to performe vnlawfull or vnpossible Vowes. Iudg. 11. 35, 39. To pretend we cannot performe the Vow of Baptisme, and such like lawfull Vowes, when we will not. Not to performe the Vow of Baptisme, or those wher∣by it is renewed: Or any other lawfull or profitable Vow, which is in our power to performe, if we will.
The fourth Commandement. The Affirmatiue part, Commanding vs to remember the Sabbath to sanctifie it. Esa. 56. 2. Whence two things are to bee considered: 1. That we must sanctifie the Sabbath. 2. That we must be mindfull and carefull of it to sanctifie it. To the sanctification of the Sabbath two things are required: viz. Rest, which is signified in the word Sabbath. The sanctifying of that rest. The rest which is re∣quired, is partly Outward, from bodily labours, and worldly businesse. Vers. 9. 10. Inward, from the seruile workes of sinne. Of the outward Rest, 3. things to be considered: 1. Why it is required, viz. as a remedy against distraction. 2. From what workes: viz. workes of our owne, and seruile workes, as Buying and selling. Neh. 13. 15. Carrying of burthens. Ierem. 17. 22. Iourneys. Exod. 16. 29. &c. 3. How farre forth works are forbidden: viz. As they are meanes of distraction, and hindrances of the entire sanctification of the Sabbath. Not as they are referred either to the meanes, or workes of sancti∣fication. To the Meanes, as the Labours of the Ministers, in and about their ministe∣ry. Math. 12. 5. Trauell of the people to the places of Gods worship. 2. King 4. 23. Workes, as the duties of mercy and charity: as to heale the sicke; to helpe a woman in trauell, &c. Math. 12. 7, 12. Hos. 6. 6. Nor as they are workes of necessity. Mat. 12. 1. to 19. Of necessity I say, Present, so as they could not haue been done before, nor may be done afterwards. Sanctified, not contracted, through our owne negligence.
The Negatiue part, Forbidding the profanation of the Sabbath. Opp. The Extremes, in Excesse: a Iewish and superstitious ob∣seruation of the outward rest, prefer∣ring it before either the meanes, or workes of sanctification. Mat. 12. 1, 2. Mark. 3. 2. Luk. 13. 14. Ioh. 9. 14, 16. 1. Mac. 2. 38. Defect: the neglect of the outward rest, following of bodily labours and worldly businesse. Exod. 34. 21.  31. 13, 14. Abuse of rest, to Idlenesse: when rest is not vsed as a meanes, but men rest in it as the end; which is worse than bodily labour. Sabbathum Asinoum. Vanity, in profane sports and pastimes, which more distract, and more hinder our workes than honest labours. Esa. 58. 13. Sabbathum Tituli. Exod. 32. 6, 18, 19. Sinne, as to gluttony, drunkennesse, whoredome, &c. Sabbathum Satanae.
By necessity therefore are excused, the necessary Labour in prouision of food. Tending of cattel. Mat. 12. 11 Labours of Mariners, being before the Sabbath on y• sea. Fight for defence of our Countrey. 1. Mac. 2. 41. Labours of seruants, and sub∣iects, enioyned by their ma∣sters, and Magistrates, &c. Mark. 2. 27. The Sabbath was made for man. The inward and spirituall rest from sinne. For as wee are to rest from sinne euery day (that in this life wee may begin our eternall Sabbath, Heb. 4. 9. 10.) so especially on the Sabbath. Esa. 56. 2.  58. 13. These workes are chiefly forbidden, as being especially Seruile workes, whereby men serue the diuell. Our owne workes. Now followeth the sanctification of the Rest, by Vsing the meanes Doing the workes of sanctifica∣tion. The Sabbath is to be sanctified, both Publikely. Priuately. The publike sanctification consisteth in Vsing the meanes of sanctifica∣tion in the worship of God. Wherewe are to con∣sider the duty of y• Ministers, who are to be the chiefe actors in the publike sanctification of the Sabbath: their duty is to Call vpō God in behalfe of the people. Reade and preach the Word. Administer the Sacra∣ments at conuenient times, and as occasion is offered. People, To vouchsafe their presence in the assembly, Leuit. 19. 30. 67.  23. 2. Cōming duly. Staying to the end. Being present, to behaue them∣selues religiously and vprightly (as hath been shewed in the second Commandement) in Hearing the Word. Calling on ye name of God. The vse of y• Sacramēts. Doing the workes of sanctification: as namely, in collections for the poore. 1. Cor. 16. 2.
Opp. Not to rest from sinne, which maketh the obser∣uation of the outward rest, odious vnto God. Esa 1. 13, 14, 15. Amos 5. 21. Opp. In the Ministers, Carelesse Non-residency Idlenesse. People, Absence, vpon no iust cause, through Negligence. Mat. 22. 5. Luk. 14. 18, 19, 20. Contempt and obstinacy, as in Recusants, whether Hereticks, as Pa∣pists, &c. Schismaticks, as Brownists. Heb. 10. 25. Departure without any necessary cause. Irreligious and hypocriticall behauiour in the worship of God.
The Sabbath is also to be sanctified priuately. The priuate sanctification con∣sisteth in duties, which either haue reference to the publike sanctification, and those either Going before, as preparation by Meditation. Prayer. Follow∣ing, as Meditation of the Word heard. Application of it to our vse. Conference with others, if wee be not alone, &c. Seuerally are required, as Meanes of sanctifica∣tion, as Reading. Meditation of Gods Word. Workes of Creation. Redēption by Christ. Inuocati∣on by Prayer. Thankes-giuing, and singing of Psalms. Ps. 92. 1 Godly conference. Works of sanctifica∣tion: as y• workes of mercy. Outward: as Almesgiuing, visiting the sicke, &c. Inward & spirituall▪ as to Teach the ignorant. Reclaime the erroneous. Admonish the backward. Exhort & stir vp one another. Rebuke the offendour. Comfort the distressed. Giue counsell to them which need it, or seeke it. Reconcile them which bee at variance, &c.
To neglect the priuate sanctification of the Sabbath, mis-spending the time in Worldly . Idlenesse. Vanity. Sinne, &c.
2. We are to remember, or (as Deut. 5. 12.) to obserue the Sabbath that we may sanctifie it. Where are duties required, both Before: so to cast our businesse before-hand, and so to dispose of our affaires and iour∣neyes, &c. that on the Sabbath we shall not need to bee distracted with bodily la∣bours, or worldly businesse. On the Sabbath, studi∣ously to obserue it, that is, both Seriously & sound∣ly, as the words import. Willingly and with delight. Esa. 58. 13. To the weekly Sab∣bath, wee are to adde all other Sabbaths, lawfully ordained by the Church; all wch are to be consecrated as Sabbaths to the Lord, whether they be Ordinary and Anni∣uersary, such as were the feast of Purim. Hest. 3. 7.  9. 21. The Dedicati∣on. 1. Macca. 4. 59. Ioh. 10. 22. Are the feasts of Christs Natiuity, Resurrection, As∣cension, & Pen∣tecost. Extraordi∣nary, wch are Sab∣baths of oy and thankes-gi∣uing. Neh. 8. 9, 10. Humiliation. Ioel 1. 14.  2. 15. 2. Chr. 20. 3.
Opp. To bee mindfull of the Sabbath to profane it: as those who hauing any extraordinary businesse, will not bestow any part of the weeke vpon it, but will reserue it for the Sabbath; and make bold with God to borrow part of his day, &c. To obserue the Sabbath for fashion sake, keeping the outward Rest onely, putting on gay clothes, and doing nothing. To bee weary of the Sabbath, and to wish it were gone. Amos 8. 5. The not obseruing of Sabbaths lawfully ordained by the Church, either through Neglect. Contempt. The mis-spending of them, (which fault is common, especially in the Feast of Christs Natiuity) to vanity and sinne.

Stuffe and apparell, for stealing whereof, those which conuey themselues into houses, are cal∣led Directarij. Writings and instruments Embezeled and stolne. Depraued & cor∣rupted, or falsi∣fied.
Robbery or Rapine is distin∣guished by the end: for thereby is intended, either the Neighbours harme, which is spoyling; as in those who are called Incendiarij, who maliciously set on fire their neighbours houses, or corne. Venefici, who spoyle mens goods or cattell, by Poyson. Charmes, In∣chantments, Witchcraft. Robbers owne pro∣fit or gain: & is com∣mitted either Vnder pretence of authority by great theeues, and is cal∣led Oppression: and that is by Vsurpation, without colour of Law. Gen. 21. 25.

Peace, whether by Land, as Robbing by the high way. Luk. 10. 30. Burglary, or breaking in∣to houses. Exod. 22. 2, 3. Sea, as Pyracy. To these sorts of theeues and rob∣bers, we are to ad∣ioyne those that be accessary to their sinne, either Before∣hand, by Consent. Psal. 50. 18. Counsell or prouocatiō. 1. Kin. 21. At the time, by helping and assisting them. After, by receiuing the Theeues. Things stolne. Partaking with them in the gaine. Pro. 29. 24. 1. 14.
Now followeth the acquisition or getting, which is by Contract, which is the consent between parties, concer∣ning the alienation or permutation of things vpon condi∣tion, and that con∣dition is either Presently performed, For the time to come, as∣sured by obligaōs Verball, wether by Word of mouth. Writing, a Bills. Bonds. Reall, as by Pawnes. Mortgage. Personall, as by Sureties. Hostages. In contracts we are to behaue our selues vprightly, without dissimula∣tion or guile, as in the sight of God, Psalm. 15. 2, 4. obseruing in our Words, truth. Zac. 8. 16. Promises, faithful∣nesse. Deeds, iustice. Contracts are con∣cerning Alienation of things for A time: Euer: and both of them either Free. For re∣cōpēce Committing to trust. The free aliena∣tion for a time, is either of the Vse onely, which is commodation or lending to vse, the property retained. Property also, which is mutuation or lending to spend; and hath place in things which are spent in the vse. In things lent to vse, the duty of ye borrower is to Vse the same to that end for which it was lent, and not to abuse it. Restore y• same particular Safe and entire, or to make it good. At the time appoin∣ted.
Opp. To Deale deceitfully. Ezech. 22. 12. 1. Thes. 4. 6. the highest degree wherof is coozenage. Vse Lying. Prou. 21. 6. Vnfaithfulnesse in promises. Vniustice and inequality. Opp. To abuse the thing borrowed, or to vse it further than the lender would like of. To impaire it, and not to make, or not to bee willing to make amends. Not to restore it at all, or not at the time appointed, detaining it against the lenders good will.
In things lent to be spent, the duty of the Lender, is to intend and seeke the borrowers good, and not his owne gaine. Surety, if there bee any, to giue his word for those that bee thrifty and honest, and to make good his word. Borrower towards the Surety, to saue him harmelesse. Creditor, to restore the principall, In the full value. At ye time appointed. The free alienation which is perpetuall, is Donation, and is heere considered as it is made, with Condition, and not absolutely. Limitation of certaine Duties, seruices, which the receiuer is bound to performe. The alienation which is for recompence, is a commuta∣tion, wherein equality is to bee obserued betwixt the things committed. In these contracts out Do vt des: Do vt facias, vel contra, that is, there is a commu∣tation ei∣ther of things them∣selues, or their vse, Mens labour and industry, for an e∣quall re∣compēce.

The com∣mutation of the things thēselues, is either of Ware for ware, which is Bartery, Money for money, which is Exchange. Ware for money, which is Selling: wherein is required as touch∣ing the Person, that he be the right ow∣ner, or authorized by him. Thing, y• it be saleable, in respect of the Sub∣stance. Vse. Price, that is be iust and equall. Manner of selling, that it bee without fraud or deceit. Money for ware, which is buying.

Thing, which is not sale∣able, ei∣ther be∣cause it is not Valuable by money: as those who sell The graces of God, as miraculous heal∣ing, 2. King. 5. 20. Pardon of sinne. Iustice, by Bribery. Vntruthes, as False witnesses. Lawyers, who be Pa∣trons of bad causes. Liberality and time, as Vsurers doe. Money-worth, be∣ing in respect of the Substance, counterfeit, or corrupt. Amos 8. 6. Vse, vnprofitable, or hurtfull. Price, being vnequall: in which respect they chiefly offend, e∣uen as publike theeues, whose practice is, to raise the prices of things, as Regraters. Forestallers. Ingrosers. Dardanarij, Hucksters, and whorders vp of commo∣dities, to cause a dearth. Prou. 11. 26. Manner, when mē vse de∣ceitfull Words, Flattering the buyer. Praising the ware vnworthily, and con∣cealing or extenuating the faults ther∣of, not lessening the price. Deeds, in respect of the Kind, giuing one for another.

Price, that thou giue, and if thou hast know∣ledge, that thou offer an equall price: and if he sell for need, to giue rather more, than lesse than the worth. Manner, that it bee void of all deceit and wrong.
Opp. In regard of the Person, to buy of him that hath no right to sell: as to buy stolne goods. Thing, to buy that, which ei∣ther Cannot be valued by money, as The graces of God: which properly is Symonie. Act. 8. 18, 19. Remission of sin: as those which buy Pardons. Holy orders, &c. Ought not to be bought or sold for money, as Presentations vnto Benefices, which also are cal∣led Symony. Vniustice, of a Iudge corrupted by thee.

Clippers of coyne. Number, as to deceiue in the tale, to giue 9. pence, for 12. pence, or 7. shil∣lings 6. pence, for 10. shil∣lings, &c.
To the former contracts we are to refer oppignoration, which is a con∣tract partly of Lending and borrowing vpon a pawne. Buying and selling, if the condition be not obserued. The duty of the giuer of the Pawne is, not to deceiue the taker, in the worth thereof. The duty of the lender vpon a pawne is, to prouide onely for his indemnity: as if hee haue to deale with a needy brother, either to Take None of him. Such onely as hee may well spare. Ex. 22. 26. Deut. 24. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13. Restore it presently. The contract which concerneth the alienation of the vse for hire, hath two parts: Location or letting to hire. Conduction or taking to hire. The duty of him that let∣teth to hire, is to Let that onely which hath a fruitfull vse, which may be seuered from the property, which he reserueth to himselfe. Require an hire proportionable to that vse, the impairing, hazard, and charge also be∣ing considered. Let that which is fit for the vse to which it is let. Beare the hazard, if it miscarry without the hirers default. Exod. 22. 15. The duty of the hi∣rer, is to Vse the thing hired, onely to that end for which it was let. Restore it at the time appointed. Restore it entire, of if it hath miscarried through his default, to make it good. Exod. 22. 12.
Opp. In the Borrower, to lay a pawne of lesse value than the summe which is borrowed, with purpose to for∣feit the same. Lender, To seeke gaine, by Taking the fruitfull vse of the thing in respect of the loane; which is a spice of Vsury: Antichresis. The forfeiture, prouiding not onely for his indemnity. To take a pawne of a needy brother, which hee cannot well spare, and not to restore it pre∣sently. Ezech. 18. 7, 12. 33. 15. Opp. To let that which hath no fruitfull vse, but is spent in the vse; which is vsury vnder pretence of let∣ting. To require an vnreasonable hire, and to take aduan∣tage of the hires necessity. To let that which is vnfit for the vse to which it is let. To exact a recompence aboue couenant, for some harme which hath happened to the thing let, without the hirers fault. Opp. To abuse that which is hired, to other purpose. Not to restore it. Not to make it good, hauing by his default impaired or spoyled it.
Contracts, wherein is a commutation of mens skill, in∣dustry and labour for an equall stipend or reward, may be referred to the Contract of Location and conduction. The duty of him that hireth another mans labour, is to Allow him an equll stipend. 1. Tim. 5. 18. Giue it him, if he be poore, with∣out delay. Leuit. 19. 13. Deut. 24. 14, 15. The duty of him that is hired, is to Require a stipend proportionable. Imploy his labour and skill faithfully, and diligently. Gen. 31. 6, 39, 40. To this head are to be referred the fees and duties of Lawyers, Physicians▪ Chirurgians, Schoole-masters, and of all Artificers and Trades-men, who imploy their labour or skill for recompence. Now follow those contracts wherein are committed to trust either Things. Persons. Things, as goods cō∣mitted to Depositaries, (to whom se∣questers are to bee referred) whose duty is to Keepe them safe. Restore them to the owner, demanding them. Make them good, if by his default they be impaired or lost. Exo. 22. 10, 11, 12. Feoffees of trust, Executors, who are faithfully to dis∣charge that trust reposed in them.
Opp. Not to allow an equall stipend to men for then labour. To detaine the poore mans hire. Iam. 5. 4. Opp. To require an vnreasonable allowance. To deale Negligently. Vnfaithfully. Opp. To vse the things committed to their trust, (by which vse they are impaired) or to turne them to their owne profit. Not to restore them, especially committed to their trust in a tumultuous time: as in feare of fire. Not to make them good, hauing impaired or spoyled them. Opp. In Feoffees and Executors, to deale vnfaithfully.
Persons committed to trust, are Pupils, or Orphans, committed to Tutors and Guardians. Whose duty is, 1. To remember, that they are set ouer Orphans, not for their owne, but for the Orphans good. 2. As they succeed the naturall parents in authority, so they ought to succeed them in fatherly affection. Hest. 2 7. The other branch of iust pos∣session, is iust keeping: which containeth two things, the Preseruing and retaining of our owne goods. Restoring of that which is other mens. Wee are bound to preserue our goods, as being Talents committed to vs of God, and not to Neglect them, or to ex∣pose thē (as it were) to pilserers and stea∣lers. Suffer them to be spoy∣led or lost. Ioh. 6. 12. which are the oppo∣site vices. Quest. Whether for retaining our goods, and main∣taining our right, it be lawfull to goe to Law? Answ. It may be lawfull (though most men offend in going to law,) if these cautions bee obserued, viz. that 1. The cause be iust, weigh∣ty and necessary. 2. Charity be not broken. 3. It be vsed as the last re∣fuge. Restitution of other mens goods, which either Haue been vnlawfully got∣ten. Cannot lawfully bee retai∣ned.
Opp. Not to seeke the Orphans, but their owne profit. To make a prey of them, and to vse them not as chil∣dren, but rather as slaues which are bought and sold. Opp. To go to law, For causes Trifling. Vniust. In stomake and malice. Not as the last remedy, but as present meanes to molest our neighbour. Opp. To persist in the wrong, by not restoring. Opp. To detaine them against the owners will.
Concerning restitution of things vnlaw∣fully gotten, these 5. poynts are to be con∣sidered, viz. 1. That restitution is to be made. Leuit. 6. 4. 5. Num. 5. 6, 7, 8. 1. Sam. 12. 4. Luk. 19. 8. Mat. 27. 3. Ezech. 33. 14, 15. 2. Who is to make restitution: viz. eue∣ry one that hath vniustly got, whether by force or by fraud, or by any vniust meanes whatsoeuer. 3. To whom? viz. to the party damni∣fied, Leuit. 6. 5. or if hee be dead, to those who are next of kinne, Numb. 5. 7, 8. or for want of them, let him giue it to good vses. 4. How much? the full value at the least, Leuit. 6. 5. Numb. 5. 7. Luk. 19. 8. or if hee be not able, yet so much as hee can. Exod. 22. 3. 5. When? so soone as hee seeketh for∣giuenesse at the hands of God. Num. 5. 6, 7, 8. Leuit. 6. 2. &c. Mal. 5. 23, 24.
Restitution also is to bee made of such things, as hauing come lawfully to our hands, cannot lawful∣ly be detained against the owners good will, we be∣ing able to restore them: and these are things which either wee haue Found, which we must esteem as committed to our trust, by the Lord, that wee may restore them to the true owner, if hee can possibly bee knowne. Exod. 23. 4. Deut. 22. 2, 3. Receiued by con∣tract, as things Alinated for a time; as things let, let, or ld to pawe. Psal. 37. 21. Ezech. 18. 12. Committed to our trust. Leu. 6. 2, 4. Now followeth the right vse of our goods towards Our selues, which is the fruition of them. Others, which is the free commu∣nication of thē. Prou. 5. 15, 16.

Iustice, that we giue of our owne, without doing wrong to others. Free com∣munica∣tion of goods, is either for A time, by lending. Psal. 112. 5. Deut. 15. 7, 8. Luk. 6. 35.

Publike testimonies out of Iudgement. And they are either Open. Secret. Open, as in Publike Speeches, as in the ministery of the Word, wherin nothing but truth is to be vttered. Writings. Elections, wherein testimony is giuen of the excellen∣cy of him, that is chosen, aboue others. The Publike testimonies which be secret, are commonly faulty, ei∣ther because they be vntrue, or at least, vncharitable: as in making, or spreading Famous and diffamatory Libels. Publike rumours.

Our care in procu∣ring, and preseruing a good Name, cō∣siseth in Vsing the meanes, whereby a good Name (though not sought for therein) is gotten, Phil. 4. 8. as to Glorifie God. 1. Sam. 2. 30.

The tenth Commandement. The Negatiue part, Forbidding in Generall, all euill concupiscence going before the consent of the will, and pur∣pose of the hart. Rom. 7. 7.  13. 9. Col. 3. 5. 1. Pet. 4. 2. 2. Pet. 3. 3. Rom. 1. 24. Gal. 5. 16, 17. 1. Pet. 2. 11. Tit. 2. 12. Ioh. 8. 44. Particular, the concupiscence of the eyes. Euill concupiscence is either Originall. Actuall. Originall concupiscence is originall sinne, which is heere forbidden, as it is referred against the neighbour: it is also called habituall, being the euill inclination and pronenesse of our nature to lust against our neighbour, contrary to the Law of God. Rom. 8. 6, 7.  7. 8, 23. Gal. . 17. Actuall concupiscences, are ill motions in our mindes and hearts against our neighbour, Gen. 6. 5. being both Foolish. Hurtfull. 1. Tim. 6. 9. 1. Pet. 2. 11. These euill moti∣ons are either, euil Phantasies and thoughts of the minde. Affections and perturbations of the heart. Those are euill phantasies and thoughts, which encline or stirre men vp to euill, and are repugnant to charity, 1. Cor. 13. . These are sinnes, and heere forbidden. Pro. 24. 9. Zach. 8. 17. Deut. 15. 9. Esa. 55. 7. Act. 8. 22. Prou. 15. 26. Gen. 6. 5.  8. 21.
The Affirmatiue part, Requiring in vs a pure heart towards our neighbour. 1. Tim. 1. 5. The purenesse of our heart consisteth in Originall righteousnesse, and fect loue of our neighbour. Spirituall concupiscence. Originall righteous∣nesse, is both a Cleannesse from all vnrighteous∣nesse, and euill concupiscence a∣gainst our neighbour. Disposition and pronenesse to all the duties of charity. This righteousnesse, as the Lord planted it in our na∣ture, so doth he require it in his Law; though wee haue lost it, and cannot fully attaine to it; and that to this end, that we seeing our vnrighteousnesse, and misery in our selues, might be forced to seeke vnto Christ, that both we might bee clothed with his righteousnesse, and also might by his Spirit be renewed according to his image, in holinesse and righteousnesse. Luk. 1. 74, 75. Ephes. 4. 23, 24. Spirituall concupis∣cence containeth the Good motions of the Spirit. Lusting of the Spirit against the flesh.
Euill thoughts, either Are cast into mens minds by the diuell, which be called his suggestions. Arise from the habituall concupiscence. And both of them whiles we be either Slee∣ping. Awa¦king. The diuell casteth his suggestions in∣to mens mindes, either Immediately by himselfe. 1. Chron. 21. 1. Ioh. 13. 2. Luk. 9. 46, 47. Mediately, vsing others for his in∣struments. Gen. 3. 1. Iob 2. 9. Mat. 16. 23. The suggestions of Satan, though alwayes sinfull in him, yet they are not sinnes vnto vs, vnlesse wee admit them, and giue entertainment to them: For it is not a sin to be tempted, (for Christ also was tempted) but to yeeld to the tentation. If therefore we admit them, we are defi∣led by them but if wee presently repell and extinguish them, they infect vs not. Euill thoughts arise also from our owne habituall and originall concupiscence. Luk. 24. 38. Mat. 15. 19. Gen. 6. 5. They arise from the ha∣bituall concupiscence, it being moued or stirred vp by some obiect, either Apprehended by the sence. Framed by the phantasie or imagination. Represented to the minde, by the remembrance. Euill thoughts happen vnto vs, Awaking. Sleeping, as in dreams.
The good motions, are righteous & charitable Cogitations concerning our neighbour. Affections towards him. The lusting and combate of the Spirit, against the flesh. Gal. 5. 17. whereby we must crucifie the flesh, with the lusts thereof. Gal. 5. 24. The meanes to attaine to this purenesse of the heart, are, to 1. Walke with God, seeking to approue our hearts to him, who tryeth the hearts. 2. Ob∣serue our Hearts, Prou. 4. 23. that No euil concu∣piscence doe a∣rise in vs, or en∣ter into vs. If any do arise, or be admitted, that we forth∣with extin∣guish it. Senses. That euill concupis∣cences doe not arise in vs, or ente into vs, a twofold care is needfull, Whiles wee wake, to keepe our mindes occupied about lawfull things, and not suffer them to be idle, or to wander about va∣nities, or vnlawfull things. When wee are to sleepe, to com∣mend our soules into the hands of God, to bee kept safe from tentations, and pure from con∣cupiscences. We are also to obserue our sences, (but especially our sight) by the ministery whereof, the obiects of concu∣piscence are represented to the mind. Gen. 3. 6. Iosh. 7. 21. Iob 31. 1. Psalm. 119. 37. To these meanes we are to adde two more The spirituall armour of God, which is mighty to cast downe imaginations, and to subdue euil thoughts. 2. Cor. 10. 5. Ephes. 6. Feruent & faithfull prayer. Mat. 6. 13.
Those that arise from our owne corruption, if they be sudden and momentany, they are the least degree of sinne, but yet sinnes, arising from a corrupt fountaine, and arguing want of charity. As touching dreames, those are culpable, which as they are the fruits of originall concupiscence, so also haue voluntary causes: as, Wanton and vncleane dreames, following vpon Intemperancy in diet. Wanton & vncleane thoughts. Malicious dreames, proceeding from hatred of our neigh∣bour, and such like. Now follow the affections and perturbations of the minde, going before the purpose of the heart, or consent to practise. T degrees of them. And these are either , fore-passions, or (as some speake) vnformed concupiscences, and acts of sensuality, going before the act of reason, or consent of the will. These be the first motions of concupiscence, whereby the Mind is withdrawne. Heart is affected with a sudden delight, as it were a bait. Iam. 1. 14, 15. , 1. Thes. 4. 5. Passions, which are of some called, For∣med concupiscences, and are acts of rea∣son, as being delibe∣rate desires of the heart, & hauing the consent of the will▪ either to Take further delight onely in entertaining the fore-said ill motions, and rouling them in our minds, though we consent not to the practice of them. These, with all the former, are directly and expresly forbid∣den in this tenth Comman∣dement. Put them in practice, which are forbidden in the former Com∣mandements; as the murther, adultery, theft, false testimo∣nies of the heart.
The sorts. The affections of the heart, are either , wherein is auersation from that which seemeth euill, as an∣ger, feare, &c. , wherein is a liking or de∣siring of that which seemeth good, as loue, &c. Vnto , we are in this place to referre as branches of this Commandement, sudden anger, and the first mo∣tions of mislike, hatred, enuie, reioycing at other mens e∣uils, &c. , which more pro∣perly is called concupis∣cence, is distinguished by the obiects, 1. Ioh. 2. 15. for it is either of Pleasure, which is the lust of the flesh. Profit, which is the lust of the eyes. Honour, which is the pride of life. The particular concupiscence which by name is forbidden in this Commandement, is the concupiscence of the eyes, vn∣der which, as being the most pernicious, 1. Tim. 6. 9, 10. the Lord forbiddeth all sins of the same kind, that is, all euill mo∣tions and concupiscences going before the consent of the will, or purpose of the heart. Affirm. Remedies against the concupiscence of the eyes. 1. To mortifie selfe∣loue. 1. Cor. 10. 24. 2. To pull out the eyes of enuie. 3. To arme our selues with contentednes. Phil. 4. 11.
This concupis∣cence is distin∣guished accor∣ding to the va∣riety of the ob∣iects, wch be∣ing the persons or goods be∣longing to o∣ther men, wee are not to co∣uet, as our neighbours House. Esa. 5. 8. Field. Deut. 5. 21. 1. King. 21. Wife. Man-seruant. Maid-seruant. Cattell, as Oxe, or Asse. 1. Sam. 12. 3. Money, apparell, stuffe. Act. 20. 33. Or any thing that is his. In all the Comman∣dements, adde to the Affirmatiue part, and to all the duties therein re∣quired, the duty of Vsing the meanes. Shewing forth the signes. Procuring y• same in others. Negatiue part, and to all the vices therein forbidden, the fault of Neglecting the goodmean. Vsing the bad meanes and allurements to euill. Shewing forth the signes of euill. Being accessary to the faults of others. Deo Gratias.
