Freesland, of Salins, and of Mechlen, of the Citie, Cities, and Landes of Vtreht Oue∣ryssel, and of Groening, Dominator in Asia, and Affricke. And we Philip by the same grace, prince of Spaine, of both the Secillies of Ierusalem, &c. Lord of Hubsburgh of Flanders, &c. To al them yt shal see these presents, gretings. Forasmuch & to shew and declare the bet∣ter our inheritant lāds on this side & ye good and true subiectes therof, the vpright loue, fauour, and affection, which we Emperors alwayes haue borne and yet are bearing. Not requiring, but that which is and con∣cerneth their commō welfaring, rest, peace, and assuraunce. We haue sent for, and cau∣sed to come ouer, our welbeloued prince of Spaine, to the intent that hee him selfe shoulde see, examine, visite, and knowe the said our heritable landes of the Low coun∣treys, proceeded of succession, and likewise shewe vnto the subiectes thereof, the good and special true loue and effection which he beareth vnto them. To the intent they shuld be more enclined, affectioned, and to bee bounde to remaine, and for the same cer∣taine other speciall reasons, haue we resol∣ued,
and concludteh him to be receiued, helde, and sworne, by the States and mem∣bers of all our saide heritable landes, and among others by the Prelates, Nobles, & foure chiefe Cities of this our Dukedome and countreys of Brabant, for their natu∣rall and chiefest Prince and Lorde, for him his heires and successors, to bee oc∣cupied after our discease, the said our Duke∣dome and countreys of Brabant, with his appurtenances, as iust and lawfull Lorde thereof: All which we haue caused to be proposed and declared to the aforesaid three States of Brabant in our presence, and in the presence of our welbeloued sister, and Aunte of our Prince, lady Marie Queene Dawgieresse of Hungarie, of Boheme, &c. In our absence Regent and gouernour of our said heritable landes. And that our will and intention hath beene, and is yet, that our saide sonne the Prince as our on∣ly heire to come, likewise do graunt, pro∣mise, and sweare the ioyfull income, after the olde order and custome. But because that in the ioyfull income which we and our forefathers haue sworne, are in some points and matters already done, and totally per∣fourmed,
others which are not to bee per∣fourmed, nor reasonably for the common wealth and quietnesse of the same countrey. And considering that our said sonne thinkes and doeth require all that which hee shall graunt, promise, & sweare vnto them point∣ly to obserue and perfourme. So haue we caused to be made communicacion with the aforesaide three States of Brabant, for to haue our ioyful incomming to be seene ouer and visited, because that they them selues might consider al that which oughte there∣in to be moderated and variated. And for to refourme the articles which shoulde bee found not to be obseruable, nor mainteined. According to which ther had bene kept, di∣uers communicacions and assemblings to∣gether, so that finally after diuers delay∣ings, aduisements, opinions, & reports re∣spectiuely made one to another, they haue in that behalfe consented and willed them selues, according to ye acte hereupon made, signed by them. And also we Prince hauing sure and well vnderstanded the aforesayde ioyfull income of our Lorde and Father, and likewise the adioyned letters and addi∣tions thereof, with also the other adioyned
letters and graunts of the sayd our grand∣father mentioned in the last article of our aforesaid ioyful income, being truely trans∣lated and sette ouer in the Spanish tongue, and likewise also the vocation and modera∣tion therof, & that which therunto is set by, according to the contention of the aforesaid acte, willing and requesting according to the good pleasure of our said Lord and Fa∣ther, the common countrey of Brabant, and the good people inhabitantes and subiects therof, their rights, priuileges, freedomes, customes, vsances, and old proceedings, ob∣serue and perfourme, especially considered, the great and manifolde seruices, fauours, and fidelitie by them at diuers times done, and shewed to our forefathers, Dukes, and Ducesses of Brabant, of disceased memo∣rie, and among others to our remembred Lorde the Emperour our Lord and father, as true subiects ought to do to their Lords. And as we trust that they likewise will do to vs hereafter. So we haue the will, and knowledge of our sayde Lorde and Father, in this our receiuing and holding within the Citie of Louaine, and with our good knowledge and will also graunted, giuen
and consented, graunt, giue, and consente, search, priuileges, poyntes, and fastnesse of rights, as here do followe, promising and swearing vnto them for vs, our heyres and successours, after the discease of our sayde Lorde and father, (whome God almightie graunt a good long prosperous life,) fer∣uent and stedfastly to obserue and mainteine and cause to bee obserued and mainteined, without breaking, interruption, for euer and euer. 1 That wee shall bee the good and true Lordes, and shall not do nor suffer to bee done to them, any force and wil in any wise, and that we shal not meddle our selues, nor suffer to be medled with the forraine lawes and iudgements.
