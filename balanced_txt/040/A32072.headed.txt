C. R. ❧By the KING. ❧A Proclamation prohibiting from henceforth all entercourse of Trade betweene Our City of London, and other parts of Our Kingdome, untill other direction given by Vs. WHEREAS out of Our tender Care to Our City of London, and in hope to reduce them to their due obedi∣ence to Us, We by Our Proclamation, hearing date at Our Court at Oxford the eight day of December now last past, did Declare Our Royall Pleasure to be, That there should be no stop or interruption to any of Our lo∣ving Subjects, as they should travell to Our City of London with any Cloaths, Wares, or Marchandize, but that they should freely and peaceably passe without any let, trouble or molestation whatsoever; Which Grace and Favour unto them, have in these many Moneths wrought this contrary effect, That above all other paths of this Our Kingdom A prevalent faction of that City (which over-rules the whole) hath so far joyned with, and in that horrid Rebellion, that it hath denounced war against the whole Kingdom, by violent opposing all the possible wayes to Peace; and so that City formerly famous for their Loyalty, and Love to their Sovereigns, is now become the head of that Traiterous faction, and the receptacle of all such as are disaffected to Our Goverment, and the Lawes of the Kingdome: and not only willingly consents and submits to all burthens and impositions laid upon them, for the support and maintenance of the Rebellious Armies raised against Us, but malitiously pro∣secutes and pursues all such who are but suspected to wish well to Our Service. And when We pitying the desperate and deplo∣rable condition of Our People, were gratiously pleased to desire a Treaty for an Accommodation, and propounded that whilest that Treaty should continue, there might be a cessation of Armes, and a free Commerce for all Our loving Subjects in all parts of Our Kingdome, that so the benefits of Trade and Commerce being injoyed, Our good People might bee the more in love with Peace, yet this motion thus proceeding from Us was neverthelesse by speciall incitation from the City of London (which by the Grace of Our said Proclamation enjoyed the said advantage of the whole Kingdome) scornfully neglected by the enemies of Peace, and all entercourse interdicted to Our City of Oxford, the present place of Residence for Our Court and Army, and that restraint is continued upon all those who are thought to be serviceable, or but well affected to Us: We therefore being thereunto enforced out of this necessity, and finding that the Trade and Commerce of the Kingdome, which ought to be maintained for the publicke benefit of all Our good People, is by this meanes inverted only for the advantage of those Places, and Persons which che∣rish this Rebellion, the Goods and Merchandise of such who are thought well affected to Us being seised when they are brought, to London, have thought it fit and reasonable to revoke and recall that Our former Act of Grace and Favour. And by this Our Pro∣clamation, We doe publish and Declare to all Our Subjects, That whosoever of them, either in their persons shall from hence∣forth travell unto Our City of London, without License from Our Selfe, or one of Our Principall Secretaries of State, the Gene∣ralls, or Lieutenant-Generalls of Our Armies, or the Governours of any of Our Townes, Castles, or Forts, or with their Goods, Catle, Victuall or Merchandize of any sort whatsoever, shall from henceforth travell unto, or for Our said City of London or Suburbs thereof, without Our expresse Licence for the same under Our Signe Manuall, shall adventure the same at their own Pe∣rills, We being resolved by all possible means to seize the same; And that all those who from any parts of this Our Kingdome shall furnish or serve Our said City of London or Suburbs thereof, either by Sea or Land, with any Victualls, or other Provisions, or with any Merchandize to maintaine them or their Trade, as long as they shall obstinately stand out in Rebellion a∣against Us, We shall esteem as persons disaffected to Us, and to Our Government, and as Ayders & Assisters to the Rebells, and shall according∣ly deale with them, and proceed against them: And that this restraint shall continue upon them untill such times as the inhabitants of the said City, finding their errors, shall returne to their due obedience unto us, straitly commandaig all the Officers of Our Ar∣mies, and all other Our Officers, Ministers, and loving Subjects in all places through which any Person, Goods, Cattle, Victuall, or Merchandise shall passe or be convesed towards the said City of London, to apprehend the persons, and seise and detaine the Goods, untill upon speedy notice to us they shall receive Our further directions: We hereby assuring them they shall receive part of such Goods so seised in satisfaction and for their reward. But for the continuing of the generall Trade and Commerce of the Kingdome, and the Manufactures thereof (which We desire to uphold and advance) We leave all Our Subjects to trade freely in, and unto all other parts, and if and unto all other Ports, or Havens of this Our Kingdome, not being in actuall Rebellion a∣gainst Us; and from those Ports to Trade with their Merchandise freely into any other Parts whersoever beyond the Seas, be∣ing in amity with Us, without any restraint whatsoever. Given under Our Signe Manuallat Our Court at Oxford this seventeenth day of Iuly, in the nineteenth yeare of Our Reigne. God save the KING. Oxford, Printed by Leonard Lychfield, 1643.
