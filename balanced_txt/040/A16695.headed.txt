¶ Here begynneth the lyfe of saynt Brandon woodcut representation of Saint Brendon, in monk's robes, with a book and crook or crosier, in a compartment with the device of William Caxton's mark and initials at the bottom
SAynt Brandon the holy man was a monke and borne in yrlonde / & there he was abbot of an hous wherin were a thousande mon∣kes / & there he had a full strayte & holy lyfe in great penaunce and abstynence and he gouerned his mōkes full vertuously / & than within shorte tyme after there came vnto hym an holy abbot ye hyght Beryne to visyte hȳ & eche was Ioyful of other & than saynt bran¦don began to tell ye abbot beryn of many wonders yt he had seen in diuers lōdes & whan Beryn herd yt of saynt Brandon he began to sygh & sore wepte / & saynt Bran∣don cōforted hym ye best wyse he coude saynge / ye come hyther for to be Ioyfull with me / & therfore for goddes loue leue your mournynge & tel me what meruayles ye haue seen in ye great see occean yt cōpasseth al the worlde aboute / & all other waters come out of him / whiche co∣meth in all the partyes of ye erth / & than Beryn began to tell saynt Brādon & his monkes ye meruayles yt he had seen full sore wepynge / & sayd I haue a sone his name is Meruoke / & he was a monke of great fame / whiche had great desyre to seke about by shyppe in dyuers coū¦trees to fynde a solytary place / wherin he myght dwell secretly out of the besynes of this world for to serue god quyetly with more deuocōn / & I coūseyled hym to sayle in to an ylonde ferre in ye see besyde the moūtayne of sto¦nes whiche is ful well knowen. And than he made hym redy & saylled thyder with his monkes / & whan he ca∣me thyder he lyked ye place ful wel where he & his mon¦kes serued our lord full deuoutly. And thā Berynsawe in a vysyon yt this monke Meruoke was sayled ryght ferre eestward in the see more than thre dayes saylynge & sodeynly to his semynge there came a derke cloude & couered them that a great parte of yt daye they sawe no
light / & as our lord wolde the  away & they sawe a full fayre ylonde / & thyder  they drewe / in yt ylonde was Ioy & myrth ynough & ye erth of ye ylonde shyned as bryght as the sonne / & there were the fayrest trees & herbes yt euer ony man sawe / & there were ma∣ny precyus stones shynyng bryght & euery herbe there was full of fygures / & euery tree full of fruyte so that it was a gloryous syght & an heuenly Ioy tabyde there / & thā there came to them a fayre yonge man & full curtes¦ly he welcomed them al & called euery monke by his na¦me & sayd yt they were moche boūde to prayse ye name of our lord Ihū yt wolde of his grace shewe to thē ye glory∣ous place wher is euer day & neuer night & this place is called paradys terrestre but by this ylond is an other ylond wherin no man may come / & this yonge mā sayd to them ye haue ben here halfe a yere wtout mete drȳke or slepe / & they supposed yt they had not ben there ye spa¦ce of halfe an houre / so mery & Ioyful they were there & the yōge man tolde theym yt this is ye place that Adam & Eue dwelte in fyrste / euer sholde haue dwelled there yf yt they had not broke yt cōmaundement of god & than the yonge man brought them to theyr shyppe agayne & sayd they myght no lenger abyde there / and whan they were all shypped sodeynly this yonge man vanysshed awaye out of theyr syght / & than within shorte tyme af¦ter by ye purueyaūce of our lorde Ihesu they came to ye abbay where saynt Brandon dwelled / & than he with his brethren recyeued them goodly & demaunded them where they had bē so longe / & they sayd we haue bē in ye londe of by heest afore the gates of paradys where as is euer day & neuer nyght & they sayd all yt the place is full delectable / for yet all theyr clothes smelled of ye swete & Ioyfull place. And than saynt Brandon purposed sone
after for to seke  e by goddes helpe / & anone be∣gan to puruey for a good shyppe & a stronge & vytayled it for seuen yere / and than he toke his leue of all his bre∣therne & toke .xii. monkes with hym / but or they entred in to the shyppe they fasted forty dayes & lyued deuoute¦ly and eche of them receyued the sacrament / and whan saynt Brandon with his .xii. monkes were entred in to the shyppe there came other two of his monkes and prayed hym that they myght sayle with him. And than he sayd ye may sayle with me but one of you shall go to hell or ye come agayne / but not for that they wolde goo with hym. And than saynt Brādon bad the shypmen to wynde vp ye sayle & forth they sayled in goddes name so yt on the morowe they were out of syght of ony londe and forty dayes & forty nightes after they sayled playne eest. And than they sawe an ylonde ferre fro them. and they sayled theyderwarde as fast as they coude & they sawe a grete rocke of stone appere aboue all the water and thre dayes they sayled aboute it or they coude gete in to ye place. But at the last by the purueeaunce of god they founde a lytell hauen & there wente a londe euery thone and than sodeynly there came a fayre hoūde & fell downe at the fete of saynt Brandon & made hym good there in his maner / and than he badde his brethren be of good there / for our lorde hath sente to vs his messen¦ger to lede vs in some good place / & the hoūde brought them in to a fayre halle where they founde the tabbles spredde redy set ful of good mete and drynke. And than saynt Brandon sayd graces / & thā he and his brethren sate downe and ete and dranke of suche as they founde And there were beddes redy for them wherin they to∣ke theyr rest after theyr longe labour. And on the morne they retourned agayne to theyr shyppe & sayled a longe
tyme in the see after or they coude fynde ony lōde tyl at the last by ye puruyaūce of god they sawe ferre fro them a full fayre ylonde full of grene pasture wherin were ye whytest & gretest shepe that euer they sawe. For euery shepe was as great as an oxe & soone after came to them a goodly olde man / whiche welcomed them & made to them good chere / & sayd this is yt ylonde of shepe & here is neuer colde weder but euer somer & that causeth the shepe to be so great & whyte they ete of the best grasse & herbes that is ony where & than this olde man toke his leue of them and badde them sayle forth ryght eest and within shorte tyme by goddes grace that they shold co∣me in to a place lyke paradys / wherin they sholde kepe theyr eester tyde & than they sayled forth & came soon af¦ter to that londe but bycause of lytell depth in some pla∣ce & in some place were great rockes but at the last they wente vpon an ylonde wenynge to them they had ben saufte & made theron a fyre for to dresse theyr dyner but saynt Brandon abode styll in the shyppe & whan yt fyre was ryght hote & the mete nygh soden than this ylōde began to moue / werof the monkes were aferde / & fled anone to shyppe & lefte the fyre & mete behynde them & meruayled sore of the mouynge / & saynt Brandon com¦forted them and sayd that it was a great fysshe named Iasconie whiche laboured nyght & day to put his tayle in his mouth but for gretenes he may not. And than a∣none they sayled west thre dayes & thre nyghtes or they sawe ony londe / wherfore they were ryghe heuy / but soone after as god wolde they sawe a fayre ylonde full of floures herbes & trees / werof they thanked god of his good grace / & anone they wente on londe / & whan they had gone longe in this they foūde a full fayre well and therby stode a fayre tree full of bowes / & on euery
bough sate a fayre byrde / & they sate so thycke on ye tree that vnneth ony lefe of the tree myght be seen the nom¦bre of them was so grete & they sange so meryly that it was an heuenly noyse to here / wherfore saynt Brādon kneled downe on his knees & wepte for Ioye / & made his prayers deuoutly to our lorde god to knowe what these byrdes mente. And than anone one of the byrdes fledde fro the tree to saynt Brandon & he with flekeryn¦ge of his wynges made a full mery noyse lyke a fydle yt hym semed he herde neuer so Ioyfull a melody / & than saynt Brandon cōmaūded the byrde to tell hym ye cause why they sate so thycke on the tree & sange so merely / & than the byrde sayd. Somtyme we were aungelles in heuen / but whan our mayster lucyfer fell downe in to hell for his hye pryde / & we fell with hym for our offen∣ces / some hyger / & some lower after the qualyte of the trespace & bycause our trespace is but lytell therfore our lorde hath set vs here out of all payne in full grete Ioye & myrth after his pleasȳge here to sarue hȳ on this tree in the best maner we can / the sonday is a day of rest fro all worldly occupacyon / & therfore that daye all we be made as whyte as ony snowe for to prayse our lorde in the best wyse we may / & than this byrde sayd to saynt Brandon that it is .xii. monethes passed yt ye departed fro your abbey & in ye .vii. yere here after ye shal se ye pla¦ce yt ye desyre to come to / & all this .vii yere ye shall kepe your ester here wt vs euery yere / & in the ende of the .vii. yere ye shal come in to ye londe of byhest / & this was on ester daye yt the byrde sayd these wordes to saynt Bran¦don / & than this byrde flewe ayen to his felowes ye sate on ye tree / & than all the byrdes began to synge euēsonge so meryly that it was an heuenly noyse to here / & after souper saynt Brandon & his felowes wente to bedde &
slepte well / & on the morne they arose by tymes / & then̄e those byrdes began matyns pryme & houres & all suche seruyce as crysten men vse to synge / and saynt Brādon with his felowes abode there .viii. wekes tyll trynyte sondaye was past / & they sayled agayne to ye ylonde of shepe / & there they vytayled thē wel / & syth toke theyr leue of that olde man & retourned agayne to shyppe / & than the byrde of the tree came agayne to saynt Bran∣don / & sayd I am come to tell you that ye shall sayle fro hens in to an ylonde wherin is an abbey of .xxiiii. mon¦kes which is fro this place many a myle / & there ye shal holde your crystmas & your ester with vs lyke as I tol∣de you / & than this byrde flewe to his felowes agayne. And than saynt Brandon & his felowes sayled forth in the occean / & soone after fell a grete tempest on them / in whiche they were gretly troubled longe tyme & sore for laboured / & after that they founde by the purueaūce of god an ylonde whiche was ferre fro theym / & than full mekely prayed to our lorde to sende thē thyder in saufte but it was .xl. dayes after or they came thyder / wherfor all the mōkes were so wery of that trouble that they set lytel pryce by theyr lyues / & cryed cōtynually to our lor¦de to haue mercy on them & brynge them to the londe in saufte / & by purueaunce of god they came at ye laste in to a lytell hauē / but it was so strayte yt vnneth the shyppe myght come in / & after they came to an ancre / & anone ye monkes wente to londe / & whan they had longe wal∣ked aboute at the last they foūde two fayre welles / that one was fayre clere water / & that other was som what troubly & thycke. And than they thanked our lorde full humbly that had brought them thyder in saufte & they wolde fayne haue dronken of ye water / but saynt Bran∣don charged them they sholde not take without lycence
For yf we absteyne vs a whyle our lorde wyll puruaye for vs in the best wyse. And anone after came to them a fayre olde man with hore here & welcomed them full mekely & kyssed saynt Brandon & ledde them by many fayre welles tyl they came to a fayre abbey / where they were receyued with great honour & solempne processy on with .xxiiij. mōkes all in ryall copes of cloth of golde and a ryall crosse was before them. And than the abbot welcomed saynt Brandon & his felawshyp and kyssed them full mekely / & toke saynt Brandon by the honde & ledde hym with his monkes in to a fayre hall / and sette them downe a rowe vpon the benche / and the abbot of the place wysshe all theyr fete with fayre water of the well that they sawe before / & after ladde them in to the fratour and there sette them amonge his couent & ano∣ne there came one by the purueyaunce of god / whiche serued them well of mete and drynke / for euery monke had set before hym a fayre whyte lofe and whyte rotes and herbes whiche were ryghte delycyous / but they wyste not what rotes they were / & they dranke of the water of the fayre clere well yt they sawe before whan they came fyrst to londe whiche saynt Brandon forbo∣de them. And the abbot came and chered saynt Bran∣don & his monkes and prayed them ete and drynke for charyte / for euery daye our lorde sendeth a goodly olde man that couereth this table and setteth our mete and drynke tofore vs / but we knowe not how it cometh / ne¦we ordeyne neuer no mete ne drȳke for vs / and yet we haue ben .lxxx. yere here / & euer our lorde worshypped be he fedeth vs / we be .xxiiij. monkes in nombre & eue¦ry feryall daye of ye weke he sendeth to vs .xii. loues & euery sondaye & feestfull daye .xxxiiii. loues / & the brede that we leue at dyner we ete at souper / & now at your
comynge our lorde hathe sente to vs .xlviij. loues for to make you & vs mery togyder as brethren / & al way .xij. of vs go to dyner whyles other .xii. kepe the quyer / and thus haue we done this .lxxx. yere / for so longe haue we dwelled here in this abbey And we came hyder out of thabbey of saynt Patrykes in yrlonde. And thus as ye se our lorde hath purueyed for vs / but none of vs kno¦weth how it cometh but god alone to whome be gyuen honour & laude world without ende. And here in this lond is euer fayre weder / and none of vs hath ben seke syth we came hyder / & whan we goo to masse or to ony other seruyce of our lorde in the chyrche / anone seuenta¦pers of waxe ben set in the quere & ben lyght at euery ty¦me without mannes honde / & soo brenne daye & nyght at euery houre of seruyce and neuer waste ne mynysshe as longe as we haue ben here whiche is .lxxx. yere. And than saynt Brandon wente to the chyrche with the ab¦bot of the place and there they sayd euensonge togyder full deuoutly. And than saynt Brandon loked vpwar∣de towarde the crucyfyxe / & sawe our lorde hangynge on the crosse / whiche was made of fyne crystall & cury∣ously wrought. And in the quere were .xxiiii. seetes for xxiiii. monkes & the seuen tapers brennynge / and ye ab¦bottes seet was made in the myddes of the quere. And than saynt Brandon demaunded of the abbot how lon∣ge they had kepte that scylence that none of them spake to other. And he sayd this .xxiiii. yere we spake neuer one to another / & than saynt Brandon wepte for Ioye of theyr holy conuersacyon. And than saynt Brandon desyred of the abbot that he & his monkes myght dwel there styll with him. To whome the abbot sayd. Syr that may ye not do in noo wyse for our lorde shewed to you in what maner that ye shall beguyded tyll the seuē
yere be fulfylled & after that terme thou shalte with thy monkes retourne in to yrlonde in saufte / but one of the two monkes that came last shall dwell in the ylonde of ankers / & that other shal go quyke to hell. And as saynt Brandon kneled in ye chyrche he sawe a bryght shynyn∣ge aūgell / came in at the wyndowe and lyghted all the lyghtes in the chyrche. And than he flewe out agayne at the wyndowe to heuen / & than saynt Brandon mer∣ueyled gretly how the lyght brenned so fayre & wasted not. And than the abbot sayd that it is wryten yt Moy¦ses sawe abusshe all on fyre / & yet it dyde not brenne / & therfore meruayle not therof / for yt myght of oure lorde is now as great as euer it was. And whan saynt Bran¦don had dwelled there fro crystmasse euē tyll ye twelfth daye was passed. Than he toke his leue of the abbot & the couent & retourned with his monkes to his shyppe and sayled fro thens with his monkes towarde the ab¦bay of saynt Helarye. But they had great tempestes in the see fro that tyme tyll palme sondaye. And than they came to the ylonde of shepe & there were receyued of the olde man whiche brought them to a fayre hall & serued them. And on she erthursdaye after souper he wasshed theyr fete & kyssed them lyke as our lorde dyd to his dys∣cyples. And there abode tyll saterdaye eester euen. And than they departed & sayled to the place where the gre∣te fysshe laye / and anone they sawe theyr caudron vpon the fysshes backe / whiche they hadde lefte there twelue monethes tofore / and there they kepte the seruyce of ye resurreccyon on the fysshes backe and after they sayled that same day by the mornynge to the ylonde where as the tree of byrdes was. And than the sayde byrde wel∣comed saynt Brandon and all his felawshyp / and wen¦te agayne to the tree and sange full meryly / & there he
and his monkes dwelled fro eester tyll trynyte sondaye as they dyde the yere before / in full great Ioye & myrth And dayly they herde ye mery seruyce of the byrdes syt¦tynge on the tree. And than the byrde tolde vnto saynt Brandon that he sholde retourne agayne at crystmasse to the abbey of monkes / & at ester thyder agayne / and the other dele of the yere labour in the occean in full gre¦te perylles / and fro yere to yere tyll the seuen yere be ac∣complysshed. And than shall ye come vnto the Ioyfull place of paradys and dwell there .xl. dayes in full grete Ioye and myrth / and after ye shall retourne home in to your owne abbey in saufe and there ende your lyf and come to the blysse of heuen / to whiche our lorde bought you with his precyous blode. ¶ And than ye aungel of our lord ordeyned all thynge that was nedefull to saynt Brandon and to his monkes in vytaylles and all other thynges necessarye to them. ¶ And than they thanked our lorde of his grete goodnes he had shewed to theym ofte in theyr grete nede and sayled forth to the grete see occean abidynge ye mercy of our lorde in grete trouble and tempestes and sone after came to them an horryble fysshe whiche folowed the shyppe longe tyme castinge so moche water out of his mouthe in to the shyppe that they supposed to haue be drowned / wherfore they de∣uoutely prayed god to delyuer them of that grete peryll And anone after came an other fyssh gretre thā he out of the west see and faught with hym / & at the last claue hym in thre pyeces & than retourned agayne And than they thanked mekely oure lorde of theyr delyueraunce fro this grete peryl / but they were in grete heuynes by¦cause theyr vytales were nyghe spent / but by the ordy¦naunce of our lorde there came a byrde and brought to them a great braunche of a vyne full of rede grapes / by
whiche they lyued .xiii. dayes / & than they came too a ly∣tell ylonde / wherin were many vynes full of grapes / & they there londed & thāked god / & gadred as many gra∣pes as they lyued by .xl. dayes after alwaye saylynge in the see in moche storme & tempest / & as they thus sayled sodeynly came fleynge toward them a grete grype whi∣che assayled them & was lyke to haue destroyed theym wherfore they deuoutely prayed for helpe & ayde of our lorde Ihesu cryste. And than the byrde of the tree of the ylonde where they had holden theyr Eester to fore. Ca∣me to ye grype & smote out both his eyen / & after slewe hym / wherfore they thanked our lorde. And than say∣led forth contynually tyll saynt Peters daye. And than songen they solempnely theyr seruyce in the honour of the feest. And in that place the water was so clere that they myght se all the fysshes yt were aboute them wher¦of they were full sore agast / and the monkes counseyled saynt Brandon to synge no more. For all the fysshes lay than as they had slebe. And than saynt Brandon sayd drede ye not for ye haue kepte by two eesters the feest of the resurreccyon vpon the gretefysshes backe / and ther¦fore drede ye not of these lytell fysshes. And then̄e saynt Brandon made hym redy & wente to masse & badde his monkes to synge the best wyse they coude / and than a∣none al the fysshes a woke and came aboute the shyppe so thycke that vnneth they myght se the water for the fysshes / & whan the masse was done all the fysshes de∣parted soo as they were no more seen. And seuen dayes they sayled al waye in that clere water. And than there came a southe wynde & droue the shyppe northwarde where as they sawe an ylonde full derke and full of sten¦che & smoke / & there they herde grete blowynge and bla¦stynge of belowes / but they myght se noo tynge but
herde great thonderinge wherof they were sore aferde and blyssed them ofte / & soone after there came one ster∣tynge out all brenynge in fyre and stared full gastly on them with great starynge eyen / of whome the monkes were agaste / & at his departynge fro them he made the horyblest crye that myght be herde / & soone there came a great nombre of fendes & assayled them with hokes & brennynge yron malles / whiche ranne on the water fo¦lowynge theyr shyppe fast in suche wyse that it semed all the see to be on a fyre / but by the pleasure of our lorde they hadde noo power to hurte ne greue them ne theyr shyppe wherfore the fendes began to rore and crye and threwe hokes and malles at them / and they than were fore aferde & prayed to god for cōforte & helpe for they sawe ye fendes al aboute the shyppe & them semed than all the ylonde & the see to be on a fyre / & with a sorowful crye all tho fendes departed fro them / & retourned to ye place that they came fro. And than saynt Brandon told to them that this was a parte of hell / & therfore he char∣ged them to be stedfaste in the fayth For they sholde yet se many a dredefull place or they came home agayne / & than came the south wynde & droue theym ferther in to the north where they sawe an hylle all of fyre / & a foule smoke & stenche comynge fro thens / & the fyre stode on eche syde of the hyll lyke a wal all brennynge and than one of his monkes began to crye & wepe full sore & sayd that his ende was comen & yt he myght abyde no len∣ger in the shyppe / and anone he lepte out of the shyppe into the see & than he cryed and rored full pyteously cur¦synge the tyme that he was borne & also fader & moder that begate hym bycause they sawe no better to his cor¦reccyon in his yonge age. For now I must go to perpe¦tuall payne. And than the sayenge of saynt Brandon
was verefyed that he sayd to hym whā he entred / ther¦fore it is good a man to do penaunce & forsake synne for the hour of deth is incertayn And than anone the wyn¦de tourned in to the northe & droue the shyppe in to the south whiche sayled seuen dayes cōtynually. And than they came to grete a rocke stondynge in the see / & theron sate a naked man in full great myserye and payne. For the wawes of the see had so beten his body that all the flesshe was gone of / and no thynge lefte but synewes & bare bones. And whan the wawes were gone / there was a canuas that hynge ouer his heed whiche bette his body full sore with the blowynge of the wynde. And also there were two oxe tonges / and a great stone that he sate vpon the whiche dyd to hym full great ease And than saynt Brandon charged hym for to tell hym what he was. And he sayd my name is Iudas yt soll¦de our lorde Ihesu cryste for .xxx. pens whiche sytteth here soo wretchedly / how be it I am worthy to be in the gretest payne that is. But our lorde is so mercyful that he hath rewarded me better thā I haue deserued For of ryght my place is in the brennynge fyre of helle. But I am here but certayne tymes of the yere that is fro crystmasse to twelfth daye and fro eester to wytson tyde be paste and euery feestfull daye of our lady & eue∣ry saterdaye at none tyll sondaye that euensonge be do∣ne but all other tymes I lye styll in hell in full brennyn¦ge fyre with Pilate / Herode & Cayphas therfore accur¦sed be the tyme that euer I knewe them And than Iu¦das prayed saynt Brandon for to abyde styll there all that nyghte / and that he wolde kepe hym styll that the fendes sholde not fetche hym to hell. And than he sayd to hym with goddes grace / thou shalte abyde here all this nyght And than he asked. Iudas what cloth that
was that henge ouer his heed & he sayd it was a clothe that he gaue vnto a lepre / whiche was bought with the money that he stale fro our lorde whan I bare his purse / wherfore it dooth to me full great payne now in betynge my face with the blowynge of the wynde. And these two oxe tonges that hāge here aboue me I gaue them somtyme to two preestes to praye for me / them I bought with myn owne money / & therfore they ease me bycause the fysshes of the see gnawe on thē & spare me And this stone that I syt on laye somtyme in a desolate place / where it eased noo man / and I toke it thens and layde it in a foule waye where it dydde moche ease vnto them that wente by that waye. And therfore it easeth me now / for euery good dede shal be rewarded & euery euyll dede shalbe punysshed. And on the sonday ayenst euen there came a great multytude of fendes blastynge and rorynge / & they bad saynt Brandon goo thens that they myghte haue theyr seruaunte Iudas / for we dare not come in the presence of our mayster but yf we bryn∣ge hym to hell with vs. And than sayd saynt Brandon I lette not you to do your maysters commaundement but by the power of our lorde Ihesu I charge you to le¦ue hym this nyghte tyll to morowe. How darest thou helpe hym that solde his mayster for .xxx. pens vnto ye Iewes / and caused hym also to dye ye moost shamefull deth vpon the crosse. And than saynt Brandon char∣ged the sendes by his passyon that they sholde not noye hym that nyght. And than ye fendes wente theyr waye rorynge and cryenge towardee hell to theyr mayster ye great deuyll / & than Iudas thanked saynt Brādon so ruefully that it was pyte to se and on the morne the fen¦des came with an horryble noyse sayenge yt they had that nyghte suffred great payne by cause they broughte
not Iudas and sayd that he sholde suffre double payne the .vi. daye folowynge & they toke than Iudas trem∣blynge for fere wt them to payne. And after saynt Brā∣don sayled south warde thre dayes & thre nyghtes & on the fryday they sawe an ylonde. And than saynt Bran∣don began to synge & sayd I se ye ylonde wherin saynt Poule the heremyte dwelleth & hath dwelled there .xl. yere without mete & drynke ordyned by mannes hon¦de / & they came to the londe saynt Poule came & welco¦med them humbly he was olde & forgrowen so that no man myght se his body Of whome saynt Brādon sayd wenynge / now I se a man that lyueth more lyke an aū¦gell than a man / wherfore we wretches may be asha∣med that we lyue no better. Than saynt Poule sayd to saynt Brandon / thou arte better than I for our lorde hath shewed to the moo preuitees than he hath done to me / wherfore thou oughtest to be more praysed than I To whom sayd Brandon saynt / we be monkes & must labour for our mete. But god hath prouyded for the su∣che mete as thou holdest the pleased / wherfore thou art moche better thā I. To whome saynt poule sayd som¦tyme I was a monke of saynt Gatrikes abbey in yrlon¦de & was warden of the place where as men entre in to saynt Patrykes purgatorye. And on a daye there came one to me & I asked hym what he was. And he sayd I am your abbot Patryke & charge the that thou departe fro hens to morne erly to the see syde & there thou shalte fynde a shyppe in to whiche thou muste entre / whiche god hath ordeyned for yt whose wyll thou must accom¦plysshe / & so the nexte day I arose & wente forth & soūde the shyppe in whiche he entred / & by the purueyūce of god I was brought in to this ylonde the seuenth daye after. And than I left the shyppe & wente to londe and
there I walked vp & downe a good whyle. And than by the purueyaūce of god there came an otter goynge on his hynder fete & brought me a flynt stone & an yron to smyte fyre within his two sore clawes of his fete / & also he had aboute his necke great plente of fysshes whi¦che he caste downe before me & wente his waye and I smote fyre & made a fyre of styckes & dyde sethe ye fysshe by whiche I lyued thre dayes. And thā the otter came agayne & brought me fysshe for other thre dayes & thus he hath done this .li. yere thorugh the grace of god / and there was a great stone out of the whiche our lorde ma¦de to sprynge fayre water clere & swete / wherof I dryn¦ke dayly & thus haue I lyued one & fyfty yere & I was forty yere olde whan I came hyder & am now an hon∣dred and .xi. yere olde & abyde tyll it please our lorde to sende for me and yf it please hym I wolde fayne by dys¦charged of this wretched lyfe / and than he badde saynt Brandon to take of the water of the well & to cary in to his shyppe / for it is tyme yt thou departe for thou hast a great Iourney to do for thou shalte sayle to an ylōde whiche is forty dayes saylynge hens / where thou shalt holde thy cester lyke as thou hast done tofore where as the tre of byrdes is & fro thens thou shalte sayle in to ye londe of byhest & shalte abyde there forty dayes. And af¦ter retourne home in to thy countre in saufte. And than these holy men toke leue eche of other & they wept both full sore & kyssed eche other. And than saynt Brandon entred in to his shyppe & sayled euē .xl. dayes southe in full great tempest. And vpon eester euen came to theyr {pro}curatour whiche made to them good chere as he had before tyme & from thens they came to the great fysshe where they sayd matyns & masse on ester daye / & whan the masse was done the fysshe began to meue & swāme
forth fast in to see wherof the monkes were sore agast whiche stode vpon hym / for it was a great meruayle to se suche a fysshe as great as al a countree for to swȳme soo faste in the water / But by the wyll of our lorde this fysshe set all the monkes a londe in the paradyse of byr∣des all hole & soūde. And than retourned to the place he came fro. And than saynt Brandon & his monkes than¦ked our lorde of theyr delyueraunce of the great fysshe & kepte theyr eestertyde tyll trynyte sondaye lyke as they had done tofore tyme & after this they toke their shyppe and sayled eest .xl. dayes / & at the forty dayes ende it be∣gan for to hayle ryght fast. And therwith came a derke myste the whiche lasted longe after whiche fered saynt Brandon & all his monkes & prayed vnto our lorde for to helpe them. ¶ And than anone came theyr procura∣tour & badde them to be of good chere for they were co∣men in to the londe of byheest. And sone after that myst passed awaye / and anone they sawe the fayrest countree westwarde that ony man myght se & was soo cleere and bryght that it was an heuenly syght to beholde. And al the trees were charged with rype fruyte & herbes full of floures. In whiche londe they walked forty dayes but they coude not se none ende of that londe and there was all way day & neuer nyght / & the londe was attem¦perate / ne to hote ne to colde. And at the laste they came to a fayre ryuer / but they durst not goo ouer. And there came to them a fayre yonge man & welcomed them cur¦toysly & called eche of them by his name & dyde great re¦uerence to saynt Brandon and sayd to them be ye now Ioyfull / for this is the londe that ye haue sought. But our lorde wyll that ye departe hastely & he wyll shewe to you more of his secretes whan ye come agayne in to the see / & our lord wyll that ye lade your shyppe with
the fruyte of this londe and hye you hens. For ye may no lēger abyde here / but thou shalte sayle agayne in to thyn owne countre. And soone after that thou comest home thou shalte dye. And this water that thou seest here departeth the worlde a sondre. For on that other syde of this water may no man come that is in this lyfe And the fruyte that ye se here is alwaye thus rype eue∣ry tyme of ye yere / & alwaye it is here lyght as ye now se & he that kepeth our lordes hestes & cōmaūdemētes at all tymes shall se this londe or he do passe out of this worlde. And than saynt Brandon and his monkes to∣ke of that fruyte as moche as they wolde and also they toke with theym great plente of precyous stones. And than they toke theyr leue & wente to shyppe wepynge sore bycause they myghte noo lenger abyde there. And than they toke theyr shyppe & came home in to yrlonde in saufte / whome thyr bretherne receyued with ryght great Ioye gyuenge thankynges vnto our lorde, whi∣che had kepte them all that seuē yere fro many a peryll and brought theym home in saufte. To whome begy∣uen honour and glorye worlde without ende. Amen. ¶ And soo soone after this holy man saynt Brandon wexed feble & seke / & had but lytell Ioye of this worlde but euer after that his Ioye & mynde was in ye Ioyes of heuen. And within shorte tyme after he beynge full of vertues departed oute of this worlde vnto euerla∣stynge lyfe in heuē and was worshypfully buryed in a fayre abbey / the whiche he hymselfe foūded where our lorde sheweth for this holy saynt many fayre myracles wherfore let vs deuoutly praye to this holy saynt that he praye for vs to our lorde that he haue mercy on vs to whome be gyuen lande honoure and empyre worlde, withouten ende. Amen.
