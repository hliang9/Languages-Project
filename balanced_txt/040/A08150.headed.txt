NEWES FROM POLAND. COncerning the greatnesse of the Empire of Turky, and the warlike concussions where∣with they haue affrighted both Persia and Europe: you may consider it thus in the generall, that Mahomet, the author of their Religion and Alcaron, enioyned the race of Othoman to two speciall things. First, The one was the propagation of the Empire by some memorable attempt of war. Secondly, The other, the glorification of their Reli∣gion, by some remarkeable action of peace, or stu∣pendous structure of amazement. Touching the first; It is too apparant, that their territories extend to the Asian and Africane shores, from Trebizond, in the bottome of the blacke Sea, to Argier, neighbouring the Straites of Gibralter, very neere sixe thousand English miles, beside the possession of Greece, and her Ilands, with his intrusion into Hungarie, and dilacerating the peace of many Nations: They haue likewise as an
auxiliary friend, the great Tartar Chrim, from whole Ancestors Tamberlaine proceeded, who though himselfe proued a great enemy to Turkes, yet doth Tartar Chrim boast of affinity to the first Scythian Othoman, so that if his direct line should faile, he challengeth the proximity of Succession, and inioying the prosperity of these large Terri∣tories of Asia and Europe, for which purpose hee keepeth correspondency with the Turke, and at his appoyntment sendeth 100000. Tartars to assist him in his enterprises, whereby the Turkes haue many times great multitudes of men, and good successe in their attempts: For they haue preuailed both against Iewes and Christians, possessing at this houre the Metropolitan City of Ierusalem in Asia, Grand Cairo in Africa, and Constantinople in Europe, and are indeed transported with an insulting brauery, that they are a people designed of God, to bee the principall Nation of the earth, and a scourge to whip the sinners of the world. Touching the glorification of their Religion; who knowes not, that either hath been conuer∣sant in Constantinople, or would be conuersant with the stories of former times, that the Almora∣ta, Solimanna, Sophia, and diuers other Mosques, be not onely oftentous edifices and Churches of ad∣miration, but workes of charity, and obseruant ho∣linesse: yea, as we call it, money laid out ad pios v∣sus? I speake not of Iobs Tombe, nor many other se∣questred places, wherein these Princes, to demon∣strate their opinion of a Deity, and care to main∣taine
Mahumetan constitutions, imployed their time, and wealth, superstitiously conceiting some merit in their obedience; and that the ioyes of Paradise should be augmented, as they augmented their piety on earth: nay, you shall reade in that wonderfull history of Soliman the Magnificent; and the faire, though dangerous Roxalana, that she contriued her manumission, and so obtained to be Empresse, vnder a dissimuled sanctity, and holy ad∣diction to the building of a Church in honour of the Prophet, and glory of Religion. In a word, you shall find, that by this occasion, the principall Muf∣ty, with the Doctors of the Law, haue more accesse to the Emperour, and open a larger heart of secrets, then either Viceer, or Bashaw. Yea the Emperour, be he neuer so warlike, or vicious, standeth more in awe of their prohibitions, then the reuolts or mu∣tinies of the tumultuary Ianisaries, by whom a∣lone, as you reade of Hercules and Atlas supporting the heauens, this great frame of Monarchy is vp∣held, and kept secure, from any daring hands to dis-ioynt the same: and thus in generall. But if you would more particularly be acquain∣ted with the motiues, and actiue terrifying the Kingdome of Poland, and other confederate Chri∣stian Prouinces, wee must needs fetch the story a little from the beginning, and so draw it downe to these moderne times, wherein the braue Sigismond and the hopefull Prince his Sonne, haue prooued the sonnes of Mars, and registred their renownes vpon the record of honour, and filled vp the tally
of exployts with their vvorthinesse. Know then, that vvhile Sir Thomas Glouer was his Maiesties of Englands Embassador at Constanti∣nople, there was resident in his house, one Gasparo Gratiano, in the nature of a Drogaman, who was of Austria, and so a Subiect to Rodulphus, Emperor of Germany, but at last a seruant to the Prince of Mol∣dauia: that Prince, I meane, that came into Eng∣land, and had gracious intertainement with the King and his Nobles: that Prince, vvho vvas dis∣possessed of his inheritance through the povver of Competitors: that Prince, vvhose Mother I haue seene poorely solliciting the Embassador at Constantinople for reliefe: that Prince, vvho vvas vvith the same Gasparo imprisoned in the seuen Towers, for complayning of the Viceer, who tooke part vvith his Competitor: that Prince, vvho yet escaped, and vvas faine to flee for succour to all the Princes of Europe: that Prince, vvho returned from England vvith sufficient revvard, and credit for ten thousand Dollers among our Marchants. In a word, that Prince, vvho couertly came from Venice to Constantinople, and so engaged Sir Thomas Glouer, that hee had reason to complaine of the Viceers opposition, and the neglect of his ovvne fortune. For as it should seeme, he had taken vp so much money to assist him, that he almost lost him∣selfe, and made a great vertue vmbragious vvith the malignity of time. Yet doth that Prince aduenture to Moldauia, determining to re-integrate his fortune, by raising
of factions. But it should seeme still Nemesis in Tergo. For his aduersaries vvere so strengthened by the Viceers fauour at Constantinople, that there vvent out a strange Edict from the Grand signieur, both to haue a cessation of the vvarre, and to e∣stablish the Vsurper in the possession. Thus fled the Prince once againe into Poland, and vvas pro∣mised reliefe, yea, so forvvard in returning home, that some companies of foote, and troopes of Horse vvere ready to march in his behalfe. While these things vvere thus acted on the stage of variety in Moldauia, Signieur Gasparo Gra∣tiano imployed in Venice by Sir Thomas Glouer, re∣turnes to Constantinople; but finding that the Em∣bassadors fortunes vvere, as it were obscured with some cloud of disturbance, he went another way to worke to winde vp the pullies of his owne ad∣uancement, either by force, or policy, in which re∣solution all things were so auspicious vnto him, that he was suddenly sent vvith letters to the Em∣peror of Germany from the Grand signieur, which was somewhat wondred at in respect of his mean∣nesse and former seruile imployment, till it was publikely knowne that his owne brother was a Re∣negado Chawse, and in good account with the Viceer, yea, one of his sisters (as he told me him∣selfe) was taken prisoner comming as a Pilgrime to Ierusalem, and so brought to Constantinople, but whether reserued for the Turkes vse, or some Bashaw, he could not tell. In the meane while, Sir Thomas Glouer is recal∣led
into England, and Master Paul Pindar, who had been Consull at Petrasse and Aleppo, as many yeeres commorant in those parts, was confirmed his Maiesties Embassadour in Constantinople, in whose time the former Gasparo Gratiano returnes a∣gaine to the great Citty, and was imployed into Moldauia by the Viceer, either as an ouerseer of the actions of that Prouince, or as a new aduersary to the vnfortunate Prince his Master, who at last was there mischieuously poysoned amongst them, or as some will haue it, absolute gouernour, till the true titles might appeare, and the controuersies be determined. How he behaued himselfe, I will not dispute, not constantly maintaine, that he dealt treacherously with the King of Poland, certifying vnder hand, that contrary to the peace contracted with the Grand signieur, he supported the pirats of the black Sea, and the inhabitants of Bugdonia, the intestine broyles of Moldauia, the incursions of many Cos∣sacks, whereby the Turke was then much exaspera∣ted against Poland, and a manifest cloud of mis∣chiefe hung ouer all those Countries apparantly. But this I am sure of, that his Maiesties Embassa∣dor of Poland, Leigier at Constantinople, had neither so gracious audience as he was wont, not such se∣curity as the priuiledges of Embassadors presumed on. For presently the Grand signieur exclaymed a∣gainst them all in fury and displeasure, and when there was forcible intimation indeed concerning the busines of Moldauia, and the many claymes to
the Principality by factious Lords, he not onely gaue commaundement to ouer-runne that Coun∣trey, but to teach Poland it selfe a new lesson of o∣bedience, yt durst be auxiliary to a petty Prouince, against so mighty a Monarke and greatest Prince in the world: nor ended it thus in a kinde of slen∣der inuectiue, but the threatnings had tearmes of ostentation, besides the exprobrating their perfi∣diousnesse, yea, the letters had wonderfull titles, and far-fetcht denominations, the Embassies, mix∣ture of profanenesse, and presumption of ouer-run∣ning Europe; and all this was done in the life of Achmate, though for the time the whole frame of this conceiued displeasure proued a Babylonish Tovver, and ended onely in confusion of Langua∣ges: For as yet more then the customary breaking out of the Cossacks of Bogdonia, and the territories about the blacke Sea, there vvas no mayne Army on foote, but onely certaine preparatiues to a fol∣lovving warre. For as if hee would leaue his rage hereditary, he commanded the principall Mufti and Doctors of the Law to remember this charge to his Sonne, and put him in minde of the prose∣cution: which accordingly vvith filiall obedience he performed indeed, and brought out the furies of his vengeance to act that part, which they haue now played in those Countries. But because many remarkeable things happened in the death of Ach∣mate, before this young Phaeton came to guide and manage the Horses of this Monarchies Chariot, giue mee leaue to insist a little vpon them, and
modell out this relation to some forme of pleasure and contentment. Achmate comming to the Empire at 15. yeeres old, remained in the same, till he was almost thirty, in which time pleasure surfetted on ease, and ease had such changes of wantonnesse, that hee seemed weary with the continuance of delight: for Sarda∣napalus came short of him for abundāce of Concu∣bines, and variety of luxurie: so that if it bee true, that Voluptates commendat rarior vsus, it must needs follow, that to play thus continually, proued as te∣dious to him as to worke; and to gurmandize thus without cessation, must needs raise rather a loth∣somenesse then satisfaction. In briefe, he had so ma∣ny wiues & children, that, in a maner, he forgot the the glory of his Family, & the prosecution of glori∣ous enterprises, giuing himselfe ouer to the Syrens incantation of Lust and lasciuiousnesse: in the heate of which outrage, he determined to kill his brother Mustapha, a Prince of great expectation, whom, as yet, some supernaturall prouidence had preserued from death: But now to colour his pretences, such was the law, such was the custome, nay, such was the necessity of preseruation, that as Nature teacheth all creatures the way of security; so had Policy in∣structed these Princes by this one Machiaueliā trick to preuent mischiefes, insurrections, factions, com∣petitions, murthers, and all such affrightings that make Princes vnhappy, if they be once put in feare indeed. This made Damocles that he could eate no meate, when hee saw the sword ready to fall vpon
him, that hung ouer his head by a horse haire. This made the Emperour tell his flatterer, that if he knew what cares were the Companions of his Crowne, he would not take it vp, though it lay in his way as a donation of Fortune. This made Dio∣nysius trust none but his daughter, to burne off his haire with nutshels: and this made Achmate to con∣tinue the custome of his Progenitors, by remouing all the causes of terrour and suspition, though the life of his brethren payed for it. But what sayes the Poet? Multa cadunt inter ca∣licem supremáque labra. So as this iolly Prince was running away with the apprehension of his happi∣nesse, setting downe a determinate houre for the strangling of Prince Mustapha his brother, the night before the period of his Catastrophe, a fearfull Vision diuerted him from the enterprise, and a fear∣full voyce ecchoed in his eares, that there could bee no Religion in murther; and those sacrifices which the Tyrants made in former times, of blood and humane flesh, were the causes of the ruine and de∣uastation of their Monarchies; yea, vtter losse of body and soule to the Princes themselues.
Little thought the great Turke to haue found a greater Greatnesse in his sleepe, and lesse did hee suspect that there was such a God aboue to coun∣termand the gods on the earth. But so predomi∣nant was his ouer-ruling Genius at this time, and so tractable his obedience, that the very ext day hee sent for the principall Mufty, some Doctors of the Law, and Scander Bashaw, who was delegated Gene∣rall against the Polonians: To whom hee imparted the apparition, and of whom hee receiued some∣thing sortable to the flattering of Princes; but al∣together vnseasonable, because his soule was touch∣ed with some rough hands, & he wisely considered there was more to bee looked after, then a present greatnesse, or flourishing tyranny: whereupon e∣uen in their presence he sends for his brother, dis∣chargeth his Mutes, who were the officers of death, alloweth him a Gard of Capogies, appoynteth him a Caska, or Banqueting-house by himselfe, and at last preuaileth thus with his owne great heart, that he venteth out these speeches: Brother, arise, (for you must know, that all men comming to tractate with the Emperour, vse a kind of slauish prostitution, till, out of his free Princelinesse, he grace them with a new fauour.) You are not, I am sure, ignorant of this secret of State, this law of Mahomet, this policy of gouern∣ment, this meanes of our security, that when wee haue children of our owne, no brothers must liue to disquiet them, nor any blockes bee cast in their way to the race of Soueraignty, which may either startle vs in our resolutions, or bee vmbragious to their tendernesse by any attempt, or suspition of treason: therefore was I resolued to wrap you vp into the Cypresse chests of your predecessors; not so much in imitation of custome, to which in a manner our fathers chained their liues and actions, as confirmation of my owne iudgement, not to commit such a sollecisme in my Soueraignty, as to
leaue a hand vncut off, which might, by way of audaciousnesse, cast defiance in the face of an Em∣perour, or sow the seeds of turbulency, to choke vp the good corne of peace and quietnesse: but sure, thou hast found some friend, whom none can finde, but by the purity of life, and deuotion of prayer: he hath told me in thy behalfe, There is no Religi∣on in blood. For as that stone-building cannot stand, which is set vp with vntempered morter: so cannot their liues prosper, who carowse the receits that are mingled with death, or reuenge. Therefore liue, nay therefore raigne, and when the thred of my life is spun, which is now a win∣ding on the wheele of Destiny, looke you step in∣to the chaire of controll. Remember the Othoman glory, and let my abhorred course of life be a war∣ning vnto thee, that surquedry and effeminatenesse be the onely clogs to a generous minde, and barre vp the gates euen in the inside, to keepe Princes out of the Palace of Honour and renowne. Re∣member, that though Monarkes would liue with∣out controll; yet there are no such enemies to the flourishings of Gouernment, as to sport before them with the tripping Faeries of flattery, and pri∣uate respect, vvhereby they shall either looke vvith ouer-big countenances, or speake vvith ouer-big voyces to the subiect, or else giue vvay to such by-vvayes of authority, that if they may bee brought backe to looke vvheron they haue trod, they vvould stop their noses at the filthy ordure of mud and ovvse, vvhen yet they might haue gone in the
smooth and sweete tract of a more pleasant and safer walke. Remember my children, that are Prin∣ces by blood, and should haue beene thy Masters by birth-right: but they are too young to rule themselues, and too great to bee ouer-ruled by o∣thers: nay, the Othoman glory must not be shared amongst a troope of dependants, nor the Chariot wheeles of our Maiesty be dashed with the daring approches of such horses, as must needs be dirty vs more then our owne flingings or wantonnesse. Re∣member thy selfe, that art, as it were pulled out of the iawes of death; and if it be a benefit to liue, or a blessing to liue gloriously, let it be thy vertue to be thankfull, and my good Fortune, that I impar∣ted this benefit to so worthy a man. To conclude, remember our God, and let not policy, like Prome∣theus his Vulture, gnaw vpon the heart of religion; but when thou seest any start aside from honest o∣bedience, be sure he is either an hypocrite, or facti∣ous. Keepe thy selfe therefore as close to purity as thou canst, and neither neglect publike meetings, nor priuate sequestration, but take heed of seruing of God for priuate respects: For that God which doth giue vs bread, will giue vs stones, and turne our heauen into brasse, and earth into iron, if wee doe not serue him for loue, and come to him with cheerfulnesse. When he had made an end, hee sent for the o∣ther Viceers and Bashawes, and adiured them to the ratification of his will: so his brother was dismis∣sed to his Palace designed, and they discharged till
they were recalled: but hee neuer troubled them more: for very shortly after, he yeelded to the sum∣mons of the great Commander of Princes, and gaue way to the alteration that followed in the State, yet for the time, with one generall consent and vnanimity they inuested the Princely Musta∣pha with the Diadem, in which he remained qui∣etly a while, as if they made a conscience of in∣fringing the will of the dead, and were resolued to admit of his vertue, that must needs adde glory to the Empire. But Scander Bashaw perceiuing his owne autho∣rity much diminished by this translation, and pro∣iecting another manner of greatnesse, if hee might be aduanced to be Viceer vnder a younger Prince, intimated against the new Emperour, that hee was too much addicted to peace and sobriety, and his coole spirit must needs draw on strange inconue∣niences vpon the Empire; but in truth, he watched all opportunity to conuerse with the children of Achmate, and found the liuely Osman, or Othoman, being eight or nine yeeres old, so forward, and sprightfull, that he durst aske him, to his amaze, if he were not his fathers eldest sonne: yea, he inter∣iected such strange questions and demands, that the Bashawes were already afraid they had done something vniustifiable, and which must be answe∣red with no lesse then the losse of their liues. Whereupon he resolued on an alteration, and so conferred with the Viceer and principall Mufty, about the towardlinesse of the young Prince, and
saw no remedy for their security, but to depose Mu∣stapha againe, & make Osman Emperour: to which, when none of that Councell and faction durst op∣pose, they presently gaue the Ianisaries a donatiue in the name of young Osman, stored the Hellespont with many Gallies, dismissed certaine Tartarians, which were to goe into Bogdonia, and were not to be tolerated till the tumult was appeased, sent for diuers Sansacks and Timatriots to attend the young Emperour, and vnder hand filled the great City with souldiers, ere Mustapha could coniecture that they intended so waighty a businesse, as the depo∣sing of a Prince. But when all things were ready, and all men pre∣pared, that were acquainted with the conspiracy, Scander Bashaw brought out the young Osman in publike; whose manly countenance, and Princely towardlinesse amazed them more, then if they had seene some Meteor or portentous Comet: What should I insist on circumstances? By a wonderfull applause they gaue him notice of their liking, and a quicke dispatch of his inuesture assurance of their approbation: so they made no more adoe, but pro∣claimed him Emperour, and allowed him all his prerogatiues, as if hee had beene of mature iudge∣ment to challenge their prostitution indeed. The next worke was the imprisoning of his Vnkle, or, if you will, sequestring him into the former Palace where his brother appoynted him to remaine be∣fore his death, with a Gard of Capogies. Here he was confined, well attended, and better obserued: For
such was his Fortune, that then Scander Bashaw ex∣cused his deposure from the necessity of their owne preseruation, and feare of the tumultuary Ianisaries, who still cryed after the sonne of Achmate, and euer after (as it still continues) the Viceers deale in no cause without his priuity and aduice; in so much, that when the ambitious Bashaw proposed the war against Poland, as a continuation of some glorious action for the honour of the Othoman Family, and renouation of Achmates charge to his sonne in re∣uenge of their darings to defend Moldauia: hee in∣terceded, vrging, The former contract was not de∣termined betweene the Emperour Mathias, or the House of Austria and his brother, and that the Prin∣ces of Europe were more war-like, and better pro∣uided then in times past: to which againe Scander Bashaw replied, as much incensed against the Polo∣nians, that there were many reasons to moue the warre, and inferences of inforcement to set forward the enterprize. First, the fleshing (as it were) of the young Em∣peror with noble beginnings in a plentifull Coun∣try, and delightsome fields, where there would bee neither Anachims nor Giants to terrifie them, nor asperity of weather or wants to exanimate the soul∣dier. Secondly, the Countrey consorted to their military manner of fighting, as being a kinde of Champion and vberant soyle, whereby their Ar∣chers might haue the more roome, and their car∣riages easinesse of trauell. Thirdly, it would keepe other Princes in awe, from assuming a liberty to of∣fend
their great Lord, or presuming that any po∣wer on earth should be able to withstand the Ma∣humetane Army. Fourthly, if Princes did not re∣uenge exasperating wrongs, they would bee vili∣pended and quickly made a scorne to inferiours. Fifthly, opportunity was not to be dallied withall, according to the saying of Fronte capillata pòst est oc∣casio calua: and now the Emperours of Germany, Rodolphus and Mathias being dead, the Princes of Germany would repine against the house of Austria, and bandy themselues to set the peace of Europe in combustion. Last of all, their owne Empire began to grow populous, and the Prouinces had need of exonerating their people, or else some plague and dearth would deuoure them, without further good or profit to the Common-wealth, then choking the ayre with the stench of their carcasses, or spoy∣ling one another with thefts and robberies. To all these the noble Mustapha punctually an∣swered: First, concerning the leading the Emperor to the martiall Theater, hee being so young, and not apprehensiue either of glory, or reuenge; it would be imputed to the priuate humour or coue∣tousnesse of some priuate men. As for security in the vvarre, opinion might bee deceiued, and pre∣sumption abused: for the Masters of Pole vvere as good horse as themselues: and though they had not such numbers, yet were they better furnished & ap∣poynted; and though there vvere not so many strong Cities to batter or surprize, yet had they learned the cunning of trenches, with the vse of
great Ordnance and fortification, yea, they knew the discipline of a Campe, and the effect of strata∣gems. Secondly, concerning the commodious∣nesse of the Countrey, to their Military discipline, what should arrowes doe against strong Corslets, and Targets of defence? Besides, they had Har∣quebuze on Horsebacke, as well as themselues, and what they wanted in number, was supplied with discipline and armour: as for the valour of our na∣tion, and their obedience to their Commanders, who peraduenture were carelesse to lose such whom they were willing to spare, the times were altered, and nature had taught all creatures the lawe of preseruation. Thirdly, concerning the terrifying of other Princes, they would be decei∣ued. For Rota fortuna in gyro, and the Turkes had not successe in a string; nay, what Monarchy was euer so established, but came at last to a pe∣riod, subiect in the same manner to diminution, as it began with augmentation? Not that I would extenuate the glory of our Ianisaries, but from modest coniecture of alteration, not to bee too confident of our greatnesse: For by experience we haue found many interceptions both at Stri∣gonium, Vienna, and Malta: wee lost the battaile of Lepanto, hazarded Tauris and other Cities to the Persian, were turmoyled with the rebels at Aleppo, and at this houre are affronted by the Pyrats and robberies of the blacke Sea. Fourthly, concerning reuenges, whereunto the Empire was engaged for feare of being slighted by others, it was question∣lesse
in many cases a worthy worke, and a tricke to deserue as much as might be at Honours hands, but in this particular it was too too true, that from the yeere 1608. to 1620. many vsurpers had started vp in Moldauia from the supportation, I will not say corruption of the Viceers of Constantinople, and therefore hee saw no reason vpon so slender mo∣tiues, as the relieuing of one another, either for re∣ligion, or neighbourhood to raise so great a warre against Poland, or breake the peace, which had been so long continued, though the vnruly Cossacks still remayne refractary, both against vs and their owne Lords. Fifthly, concerning the dissentions of the Europian Princes, the mayne businesse lay remote from them, and if there should be such occasion as the Triumuiri of Ierusalem serued the Romanes, the neighbour Princes would quickely vnite together against a publike enemy; nay, what know we, if our forces be this way gathered against Poland, whe∣ther those mighty Nauies of Europe would not mu∣ster themselues and come into the Leuant, and then what could a few Gallies doe against so many goodly Ships? Last of all, concerning the losse of men, what Prince could answere for the soules of his Subiects, except the cause were warrantable, and the warre allowable? Ambition was no plea in Paradise, nor Reuenge a iustifiable excuse before their God. Againe, if in the opposition they found as many men, and as much as enraged, what would then be the issue and finall effect? When Prince Mustapha had cōcluded, al was mis∣constred,
and imputed rather to pusillanimity then courage, or the resolution of an Heroicke spirit: wherefore they resolued to dash out these incom∣brances, and suppresse his allegations from the knowledge of the Army, and indeed to take a cleane contrary course, so that by the consent of the Mufty, and the principall Doctors of the Law, the war was determined, & Scander Bashaw prostituted himselfe before the young Osman with humble in∣tercession, that he would be reuenged: who present∣ly bade him rise, and as if he thought it a pastime, cried out, To the war: and that hee would in per∣son, though not twelue yeeres olde, goe into the field: whereupon the Tartars were sent for, the Cammels prouided, the Artillery appoynted, the bridges prepared, the pioners mustered, the muni∣tion set out, the Ianisaries rewarded, and all things ordered to the best purpose, that might set forward the enterprize, and belonged to so great an Army, and formidable a preparation. But because I am willing to touch the praises of the Polonians, and in no sort to obumbrate their glory, that haue deserued so well, not only for their valiant enterprizes, and successefull victories, but for their religious care to retribute thankesgiuing to God, that hath giuen them such wonderfull meanes of preuayling: I will now tell you how o∣thers tell the story, or adde as a supplyment this, which is yet vntold. About the yeere 1609. one Stephen liuing with the Viceer at Constantinople, pre∣tended a right to the Principate of Moldauia, and
either by fauour or presents, had the assistance of 20000. Turkes, whereby he preuayled in the proiect: yet others impute the occasion of sending these men to Mehemet Bashaw, who fayling in gathering vp the taxes and tallages of the Countrey, so in∣censed the Viceer, that he mustered a great Army against the Sonnes of the Prince of Moldauia, whom they barbarously defeated and slew with their Vnkle Simeon: and because the Sonnes of Ie∣remy were reputed Bastards, the King of Poland, by a contract from the Turkes, had the naming of a suc∣cessor amongst them, who chose Constantine the younger Sonne to bee Vaiuod: which so displeased Mehemet Bashaw, who was designed to rectifie the disorders of this Countrey, that by force of Armes he spoyled whom he list, and as it should seeme, in despite of the King of Poland, killed Constantine, and set vp one of his owne faction; which indignity not to be indured amongst Princes, caused the Po∣lonians still to helpe and assist these distressed peo∣ple; so that incited by the lawes of Christianity and neighbourhood, besides those high motiues of princelinesse and royalty, they thought it merito∣rious and a duty of renowne, and so accordingly supplied their wants, and tooke vp armes in their defence. These warres and contentions lasted till Sigis∣mond King of Sweden was chosen King of Poland, a warlike Prince, and one that had many contenti∣ons with the Muscouites, and some Competitors of his owne Nation: but taking vpon him this gouern∣ment,
hee also tooke vpon him the protection of Moldauia, so that as you haue heard, about the yeere 1618. the youthfull Osman, Emperour of Turks, by the instigation of Siander Bashaw, and the Viceers, gaue order for the mustring vp of a won∣derfull Army, consisting of many Tartars, the onely enemy to the Europaens, to whom were vnited the Countreys of Dacia, Seruia, Bulgaria, Illyria, Thracia, Epyrus, and the tributary Prouinces of Christians themselues, who durst not gainesay the Turks offi∣cers, for feare of slauery, bondage, and ouer-run∣ning their Countreys, vpon the least drawing back or murmuring, to bee made instruments of their brethrens blood. In this manner was a warlike body composed of 200000. who marched into the fields of Dacia and Bulgaria, where the Polacks incountred them with some auxiliaries out of Russia, and the borders of the blacke Sea, and although they came not neere them in numbers, yet God be thanked, they surpas∣sed them in valour, and noble performances: For to speake without ostentation, such was the fortune of the noble Sigismond, and the brauery of the yong Prince his sonne, that they neuer came to any forci∣ble incounter, but the Polonians went away with a present successe, and further hope of preuailing: for which, they euer added thankesgiuing to God, and solemne Procession for their victories: Yet you must thinke, their fortune neuer grew to that height, of such numbers as is reported to be slaine on the Turks side, but that they receiued reciprocall
damages, and saw some of their owne men made the stuffings of graues, and the furniture of a slaughter-house: onely this is certaine, that in the yeere 1620. they gaue the Tartars an ouerthrow, as they were transporting their men at the nether ri∣uers to passe into firmer ground, that their bodies stopped the streame, and 20000. at least were slaine at three seuerall incounters, which so inraged the yong Emperour, that he sware to goe in person in∣to the field with all his forces, and then it may be, there might haue beene pulled on more fearefull ruines on the heads of Christians, and their fields must needes haue beene heaped vp with many slaughtered carkasses. But the God of mercy and compassion, one way tooke pitty of these innocents and Christian Soul∣diers, and another way put a hooke in the nose of this Leuiathan, or if you will, abated the strength of Behemoth, and that by meere accident, as by these particulars may appeare: while the youthfull Os∣man full of heate and rage, prepared to goe in per∣son into Bogdonia, and so resolued without inter∣ception to passe into Poland: the first yeere he was intercepted by a plague in the Army, and so they thought it vnmeet to hazard his person to such contagion and affrighting diseases. The next yeere they will haue an earth-quake to be so formidable at Constantinople, that beside the shaking of the ground, ouerthrow of houses, and deuastation of Churches; certaine fearefull stormes terrified them more thē the hand-writing, that knockt Belshazzars
knees together. At another time, the Emperour hauing diuers Bashawes sonnes appoynted to at∣tend him, would needs, in a wanton iollity, goe sport himselfe in the Sacra porta at Constantino∣ple, and out of his Gally threw wild-fire and squibs amongst the ships, which sure would haue done much harme, but that the sailors, acquainted with the same, by wetting their sailes, and other deuices, preuented the mischiefe, offering no vio∣lence vnto his owne Gally; yet did they returne some stones and squibs into the rest: but passing by a lime-boat, whose smoke hindred them from descrying, or discouering the Emperor, they threw their hot stones amongst the Gallies, whereof one hit him full on the brest to his ouer-turning, as hee was laughing at the tacklings set on fire, and the poore slaues stripping themselues for feare of bur∣ning. Another time as he was riding on hawking, he receiued so sore a fall, that the blood gushed out of his nose, and the company were amazed at his carelesnesse. Another time sporting himselfe in the passage to the blacke sea, where the riuer (as I call it) is a narrow streame of 20. miles in length, beset on each side of the banke with Bashawes hou∣ses, like the pretty fabricks betweene Padoa and Ve∣nice, he would needs attempt to throw a handsome stripling ouer-boord, which he did with that vio∣lence, that hee had like to haue followed him into the water, had not the Steers-man left the helme, and tooke hold of his crimson satten skirts, and so stayed him; yet his Turband fell into the water,
and the youth swamme to another Galley. These and some other detained him a while from his first speedinesse of going in person into the field, or augmenting his army to such a greatnes, as was euer allowed to the presence of an Emperor. But neither these, nor any thing else could coole the heat of his fury and displeasure, but that hee must needs send both defiance, and threatning into Poland, that though his reuenges were procrasti∣nated by diuers occasions, yet would he come vp∣on them like a whirle-wind, and take a backward race, to runne the more speedily forward: nor was this message performed sportiuely, as a custome of vnkindnesse and ill conceiued displeasure between Princes, but with protestation and vowes, inuoca∣cation to Mahomet, and fearefull execration and othes to doe something memorable for the glory of the Othoman Family: whereupon, as an intro∣duction to a more and greater mischiefe, hee sent Scander Bashaw before, with a new army into Bog∣donia of 200000. Turkes and Tartars. When Sigismond perceiued it would be worse and worse, considering they resolued to be reuen∣ged for their former losses, hee acquainted all the Princes of Europe with the perill he stood in, recal∣led some of his Cossacks out of Hungary, placed them in the borders of Moldauia, fortified the fron∣tiers, and stopped the passages with new Ramparts and Barricados. Thus was an Embassadour sent to Vienna to the Emperour, by way of intercession of a peace, or truce betweene Bethlehem Gabor, and his
Imperiall Maiesty, especially betweene the Princes of Germany and him, that so their forces might be conuerted to the assistance of Poland, and repelling this common enemy of Christendome. Thus was the Lord George Ossolinski, Count Palatine of Sendomiria, sent as Embassadour to the Maiesty of Great Bri∣taine, and with him Sir Arthur Ashton Knight and Colonell, an English man, dwelling in Poland, who had audience about the 11. of May 1621. and gracious admission of his Embassy, deliuered in the Latine tongue, both in a high phrase, and so noble a demeanour, that the King with extraordi∣nary willingnesse accorded to afford him a cer∣taine summe of money for the leuying of 2000. Volentiers for a Gard to the King of Poles body. And thus were the Turkes insolent letters publi∣shed, and many Christian hearts opened the dores of Charity, and not onely offered themselues to so good a worke, but bewailed the troubles of Eu∣rope, that kept the Princes within the circle of their owne vnkindnesse, from a better and more religi∣ous care for the generall prosperity of Europe. But God be thanked, in the meane time, the no∣ble Sigismond, with the hopefull Prince his sonne, had so brauely demeaned themselues, that in foure seuerall incounters they shewed the Turkes the ef∣fect of so strong an arme, that 40000. at the least shrunke vnder the fury of a iustifiable anger, and these Infidels saw plainly, that the God of Christia∣nity would propagate his Church and Religion in despight of mis-beleeuers. Nor were these victo∣ries
passed ouer so slightly: but the King of Poland commanded generall Procession by way of thanks∣giuing thorow his Prouinces: and by way of glo∣ry and well-deserued triumphs, made the bonefires in Cracouia testifie to the world, that the God of battels had lighted them the way to successe & vi∣ctory: nor ended it so, but a Captain was sent with letters to Vienna, to participate the good newes to the Emperour, who likewise dined with my Lord Digby (his Maiesties extraordinary Embassa∣dour to the Emperour) not two dayes (being a∣bout the third of September) before hee tooke his leaue of Caesar to returne toward England. Since which time, rumour hath had such vne∣quall passage amongst vs, that many men haue bin startled againe with a strange amazement, that e∣uer so glorious a Prince, and well deseruing an ar∣my should be ouer-clouded with a tempest of for∣midable distresse. For many men will haue it, that vpon the last preuailing of the noble Prince, who was in person in the fields of Bogdonia, the Turkes were so exasperated, and the Tartars ashamed of some demissenesse imputed vnto them, that they made head againe about the beginning of Sep∣tember, and were againe repulsed with an Heroike violence and successe, in so much that a greater computation of their numbers slaine then euer be∣fore, reioyced the Polonians, that they grew ouer-presumptuous, and in a manner disranked them∣selues with a carelesnesse, which vvas neither so ef∣fectually done, nor couertly performed, but some
valiant Ianisaries of the Turkes, and certaine Spahies which are horsemen, and were here fresh, as not be∣ing in the former battell, rallyed the discomfited Tartars, and out of their great numbers brought a new battell in forme, and so gaue a fresh assault, with fearfull impetuosity, vpon the ouer-confident Polonians, who, you must consider, for all their former preuailings, had much diminished their troups, and weakened their Batalions; in so much that they gaue ground; and these Fry of Tartars, with their accustomed outcry and clamours, tooke the aduantage of their retreat, and put them piti∣fully to rowt, if not to a lamentable flight, follow∣ing them as farre as Podolia, with the terrour and bloody effects of a strange execution, which hath raised stranger reports amongst vs, as farre as the slaughter of 30000. men, besides other cruelties and monstrous barbarousnesse. In this estate stand these Easterne Countries at this houre, and feare and mischiefe houer ouer them like a thickened cloud, ready to powre down horrid showres of deuastation and misery: But that God, I hope, which holdeth the windes in his hands, and rolleth vp the heauens like a scroll, which is so glorious in his workes and wonders for Israel, which sent his Angell to destroy the Host of Sennacherib, and which will preserue the woman in the Wildernesse, in despight of the Dragons watching her, will auert his Iudgements from pe∣nitent sinners, and turne these threatnings into Ba∣laams blessings, though he came of purpose to curse
the people of God: but if againe the corrupt body of our sinnes must needs haue a purging, for the procuring of new health, and sauing of our soules in the day of vengeance: let vs submit to his cun∣ning for the cure, who knowes what is better for o wounds then our selues, and (if need be) can powre in the balme of Gilead for our perfect reco∣uery: otherwise, if they bee festered and rankled with wanton dalliance, surquedry, gurmundize, couetousnes, pleasure and ease, gentle Cataplasmes will not serue the turne, but they must be cut, seared and cauterized: all which God grant vve may pa∣tiently endure, and put into the true Christians hearts and mouthes, to thinke and say, Neither life nor death, vvarre nor peace, things present or to come, threatnings, nor mischiefe, shall keepe or detaine vs from the hope, and future possession of eternall happinesse. —Immensa est, finémque potentia Coeli Non habet: & quicquid superi voluere, peractum est.
