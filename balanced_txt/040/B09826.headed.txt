QVESTIONS TO BE RESOLVED OF Touching Religious duties, and civill actions. WHy should we take away the sence of the Psalmes (before and after the Lessons) from all such as are not learned? And from all others which have not an apt gift in reading, by many voyces uttering the same thing together? Why should we be injoyned many repetitions of one and the same thing? Why should we confound the sence in divers places of the Common prayer, or Service, by taking the suc∣ceeding verse, or part, out of the Ministers mouth? And so preventing (at least) the unlearned hearers of the benefit of it, 1 Corinth. 14. In the Lords Prayer. Why are not the words, For thine is the Kingdome, &c. permitted in the common Ser∣vice, Math. 6.9. Why not, He suffered and was buried, &c.

Why are the Godfathers and Godmothers absolutely commanded to provide for the Christian principles in Religion, of their God∣children, fher then opportunity shall permit? 1 Cor. 2.16. Why are we enjoyned to use that gesture the Papists use (and most idolatrously abuse) in receiving the Bread and Wine: and not left to that gesture which is generally received, and used by other true reformed Churches?

Is not marriage at all times of the yeere a like lawfull? 1 Timoth. 4.1. Is the first protestation touching the ring, in the solemnizing of Matrimony commanded by the Word of God?

If the reading the Canonicall Scriptures appointed by Law to be read upon the Holy daies and the like, be or shall be without due order of Law prohibited; and twenty A pochripha Chapters (or any other number) commanded to be read in their stead, or if from the Tyranny of the Bishop of Rome and all his detestable enormities, &c. be taken (without due order of Law) out of the Letany, or a prayer for the Bishops, &c. be put into the booke of Common prayer; or any other prayer or prayers, be placed contrary to the order for the forme of Common prayer; or if any prayer or exhortation be taken out of the booke of Common prayer, and other or others put in with∣out due order of Law The Minister being to use the Booke of Common prayer, and Service, according to the Statute, And none other, or otherwise: The first question is: If the Parish provide not the true booke established by Law, but a booke with the same (or such like) alterati∣ons, detractions, or addition as aforesaid; Whether or no shall the Minister incurre the penalty of the Law in not adventuring to make use of it with such alterations, detractions, or additions, being interlaced therein.
