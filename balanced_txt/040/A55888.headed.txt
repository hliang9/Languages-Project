THE Prince's Triumph: OR THE Subjects Happiness, IN A PROTESTANT KING To the Tune of, Let Oliver Now beforgoten LET Popery now be forgotten, Their Relicks are quit out of door, Their Images now lie a Rotting, Which they formerly used to Adore; At the Convention first siting, They thought that the day was their own, But now they have had a new meetting, And things in order are getting, To settle the Prince on the Throne. While that the House was Debating, The Papists Cries we shall see, And all their stories relating, The Bishops will never agree. The King the Parliament greeted, And sent them a Letter on's owne, But now their joys are Defeated, The brave Prince of Orange is Seated, To Rule on the English Throne. The Commons all were United, To Vote for an Orange as King, The Bishops were the Men that invited, And the first that Refused the thing; Because they would have the Church freed, From the Scandals of every one, But now they all are agreed, To send for the Princess with speed, And settle them Both on the Throne. The King now Sollicites the Peers, For the Birth of a true Prince of Wales, Now he thinks that the Nation's in fears, But all his policy fails; For the Parliament all have Consented, To Give it the Prince as his own, And now who e're did Invent it, The King will too late Repent it; The running a way from his Throne. Now he hath no more to pretend to, Then Ireland's Villanious Crew, The Parliament quickly will send too, An Army the Rogues to Subdue; Which if they once go about it, The Business will quickly be done, For the Rebels all will be Routed, Tyrconnel himself will be outed, When the Brave Prince comes to his Throne. At the Prince of Orange's Coming, He Called a free Parliament, Which the King long before had been Doing But Peters would never Consent; Jefferys, and he were Caballing, To Rule by a Power of their own, But at the Parliament Calling, Dispensing Power is falling, They Voted the King from his Throne. FINIS.
